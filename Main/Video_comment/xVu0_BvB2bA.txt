"This fish is so raw it's still looking for jesus" -Gordone ramsaid
STEVEN HE IS A ASIAN GOAT
“I will sent you to Jesus” It’s too classic 😂🙏
FINDING JESUS-
1:32 "CHRISTOPHER YESLY" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have seen Finding Jesus 1 & 2. It's very boring. I forced myself to watch it while I was still Christian. It's a terrible Christian film. For something mature watch Case for Christ. For something kid friendly you can watch VeggieTales, 321 Penguins, Gigi God's Little Princess or Bibleman. Those shows I would absolutely be willing to watch now even though I converted to Paganism. I advise against watching Adventures in Odyssey because Focus on the Family funded conversion therapy. I don't know if they still do. They also led the far right Fundamentalist home school movement where kids basically have no friends, they're taught that Christianity is the only true religion, that all of American history is white & that the United States is the only free country. It's quite frankly the precursor to PragerU. If anyone has any dirt on Big Idea please let me know.
I was waiting for him to say “FIIINDING CHEEESUS?!”

Do you live in US
I’m wondering why this man still goes to this store
it’s hilarious how the incredible hulk is a real movie (it’s also horrible)
i think a better off brand version of squid game would have been "cephalopod conundrums"
But what if we put Stevenhe100 will we get 100 present off. 🤔😏
Funny thing is is that the incredible bulk actually exists
1:20 “I will send you to Jesus”again for the second time
When he says finding Jesus too supposedly there's finding Jesus the first movie they made freaking two movies?!

Ð ø ų ɓ ł ę Ɗ ə ç ƙ ē ř Ɓ ü § ! ? I will send you to jæsus
You have Avengers?  they: You mean power rangers
Woah woah woah, Fiji Water is definitely a name brand, aquafina is just american for "filtered bottled tap water", I'd far rather drink a Fiji water any day over the garbage that is aquafina in a lot of places, since the local tap water quality dictates the bottled water quality even though it's filtered. Sometimes it tastes pretty bad lol
Atleast not boneR alone
I will send you to Jesus!
Yo Steven do another off brand one but when play stations are off brand
Do you have Die Hard? We have Live Soft. *jake peralta in the corner: 💀
1:32

I probably laughed more than I probably should.
Poor salesman
Fun fact, the Incredible Bulk is a real movie, and looks like it was made in google slides.
Star Wars Could have been called space conflict
IT Stephen King has a clown named Pennywise.
When he said finding Jesus 2 I laughed so hard.😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"You have star wars" "We got moon battle" That got me flying over 20 minutes☠
"Do you have Optimus Prime?" "We have Pessimus Composite"
2:50 The ad was good. Hope your happy
@StevenHe  I just popped into that store, and special offer today is "The Grandfather" starring the one and only Robert de Faro.
Can’t wait for Marvel to release Surgeon Weird
Lol i love gow he always looks shocked by seeing a customer
Mission: Probably Not Starring Tom DoubleDeckerBus.
You got lord of the rings?   We have “The Baron Of The Bracelet.”
Didn't Kevin Smith used Incredible Bulk in Mallrats?
Steven he has a "bone" to pick with you
We had a candy store in the next town over called "Incredible Bulk".
… Who gonna tell’em the Amazing Bulk is a real thing
To help with anyone wanting a laugh: 1:20
Stuff i laugh at: 1:18 1:31                                                                                 If you made it this far                                                                          I WILL SEND U TO JESUS   1:21
After that "incredible bulk" i would have done the same thing
at    least I didn't burn rice
"You have Inception?" "We have Extraction." Shows the actually film starring Chris Hemsworth. "Okay, that's fine, I'll get that, finally some legit stuff." "Never seen a customer satisfied"
I will send you to jesus
😂😂
The planking was so unexpected and amazing! Having said that, for "I will send you to Jesus", I feel like Steven hasn't used it right since the first time. It doesn't have the same impact because it comes out of nowhere.

The poses where incredible
Me: Do you have KitKat  Steven he: No but we have kitWrath
"you got Fast and Furious" "no we got slow and serious"
He could have said “Finding Jesus? I will send you right to him!” While holding up the slipper
Vin diesel more like vin gasoline
there two types of aisians, chainese (e.g. japanese )and tropical (e.g. indian)
0:53 I was thinking instead of "Fast and the Frustrated" change fast to slow to be "Slow and the Frustrated."
Only in Texas

“DOUBAL DECCA BASS?!” Man I’m dead
"You got The Office?" "We got The Workplace." "It's the one with Rainn Wilson." "It has Sunn Won'tdaughter".
0:44 "Finding Jesus 2"?! If you don't give me Finding Nemo, I will send you to Jesus!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The thing I got from the thumbnail was I thought it was gonna be some off brand movies then he’d say “I will send you to Jesus” and then the store owner would say “oh if you’re looking for Jesus he’s right over there”. Then “Finding Jesus 2”

Do u haven emotional damage no we have SOCIAL ANXIETY
I will send you to Jesus    I will send  you to hell
How can i send off brand picture?
I'm also from China and love your videos! 😊

Finding Jesus 😂
How do you even off-brand a movie? 💀💀💀I love this channel so much
no one can forget Beijing Corn's less successful competitor: Shanghai Corn.
It's not off brand, it's just "Trying to make money by copying popular stuff and selling it with the wrong name."

I have emotional damage every day😂
0:40  *finding Jesus.*  yeah that fishes eyes need Jesus lmfao
Bone alone seems like a great movie since my favorite animals r dogs 💀
FINDING JESUS BRUH 🙏
"You got Home Alone?" "You mean Office Together?"
U got wwz :we got wwtz
there's actually something called 'the octogames'
"Forget movies. What games do you have?" "We have BreakBuild, Missile Competition, Fly Girls, Towerday, Within You, T.I.B.S (Totally Inaccurate Battle Simulator) and Arachnid Kid: Kilometre Immorales." "Do you at least have Super Smash Brothers Ultimate?" "We have Great Destroy Sisters Supreme." "Overwatch?" "Underlook." "GOD OF WAR?!" "King of Battle." "STEVEN HE!?" "Oh... Heaven She. That's my favourite channel."
“Bone Alone”.  That doesn’t sound right. . . Especially when there’s a dog on the cover making that face with 2 burglars in the back.
1:03 LOL
"FINDING JESUS 2" wat da hail breh
“Mission probably not”-😭😭😭
We got captain Dc
“You got Minecraft?” “We got Digbuild.” “DIG BUILD?!” “I will send you to Jesus.”
“You got Weird: The Al Yankovic Story?” “We got Strange: A Zach Pullugrek Tale.” “STRANGE ZACH PULLUGREK?! “I will send you to Jesus.”
“You got GeorgeNotFound?” “We got GeraldIsDiscovered.” “GERALDISDISCOVERED?!” “I will send you to Jesus.”
“You got My Singing Monsters?” “We got Our Acting Entities.” “OUR ACTING ENTITIES?!” “I will send you to Jesus.”

Emotional damage  time
im surprised the joke wasn't "You will be finding Jesus in a minute"
"finding Jesus" " You don't need to find I will personally send him to you"
'do u have hulk' Well We have green boy
Finding Jesus would've been the perfect place to say "I will send you to Jesus!"
"you got fast and furious?" "we have fast and frustrated" "the one with The Rock?" "Yeah, The Sock" "The one with Vin Diesel?" "Oh he actually lost weight for this one, that is Thin Diesel"  I almost died hearing this lol🤣🤣🤣

Tom Double Decker bus
You have Scarface? we have disfigured man
Bone Alone got me rolling😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
DOUBLE DECKER BUS?? lllloooolllll
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
To be fair, there is no Japanese word for 'It'. The closest word would be 'this' or 'that'. But they would most likely directly translate it as 'イット' (Itto). It even mentions It and Stephen King in the box art and King knows about this movie. But it also says it's supposed to be a comedy horror. The English name is Bedeviled.
"Bone Alone" sounds like a XXX film lol
1:04 bro is loosing all of his brain cells XD
finding jesus 💀
He said i will send you to jesus but it's more like I will send you to find jesus
send him to Jesus, after you find him of course

0:46 THERES A FINDING JESUS 2
1:07 Instead of Moon Battle it would have been way funnier if he said Spaceballs. 🤣
"Hey you know who Vin Diesel is?" "Oh! You mean Bin Benzine?"  "Atleast you know Tony Stark, Right?" "Oh! You mean Toby Stamp?  "You know Peter Parker, right?" "Oh! You mean Pete Restauranter?"
when you finally meet the Lord, you will have the biggest mansion of all for your work sending to Jesus
“Finding jesus 2”😂
Two things. 1. "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!" and "I will send you to Jesus." are two of the funniest things on this channel. And 2. This man is the planking master.

You got Vin Diesel?  Nah, we got Vick Petrol.
I will send you to Jesus gets me everytime
Me and my sister bursted out of laughter when he said “DOUBLE-DECKER BUS!?!?”
The funny part is there an actual mock buster called the amazing bulk. Basically knockoff hulk that's purple instead of green
THE FINDING JESUS 2 GOT ME LMAO
lost opportunity for "vin petrol"
FINDING JESUS 2!!!!!!
U have a gun?
I think I have to find Jesus
Omg what happened to your head?
0:44 I though he was going to say " the only one that will be finding Jesus is you"
“You got fast and furious?” “We got slow and happy”
I wanted to visit Outdonesia not indonesia
I need a daily I will send you to Jesus line 🤣
What happened to your head
1:22 “I will send u to Jesus” hit me diying
I will send you to Jesus. Oh yeah we are still finding him heres a documentary on it. Finding Jesus.
Vin Diesel shoulda been Thin Petrol
me when I see a furry-hater : 1:21
"ThaT"
"Thin Diesel" I was expecting Vin Petrol
“You got Aquafina” “We got Fiji water” roasted
The Fast and the Frustrated. I’m dying because it sounds like a documentary on my life.  Do not recommend.
Bro i honestly thought "The Rock" was gonna be "The Stone"
*Tom Double Decker Bus?* *DOUBLE DECKER BUS?!* *I will send you to Jesus!* best line of the year.
I would watch that finding Jesus 2 lol, but first I have to watch part one
Just a thought... You could have make a joke on the "Finding Jesus" part - "FINDING JESUS you wont need to after I SEND YOU TO HIM"
Why is no one talking about why Steven has a bandage on his eyebrow? Is this dude ok?
Your gonna want to find Jesus before you send a person to him
squid game no octopus contest no crab activity! HU WAT HOW!
Do you have Mrbeast? We have A4
Finding Jesus 2 Me: *I'm going to send you to Jesus.*
“I will send you to Jesus” 😂
In all the years I've been watching waaaaaay to many YouTube videos, this is the first time I've EVER hunted down a sponsor's product. And it was great!  What kills me in 2022 is the amount of money companies spend on advertising when all they have to do is pay guys like Stephen to spend a couple of minutes joking around with their product to make an impression.  I feel owned.  But it feels good.   What the Haaaail!
I watched bone alone, it was.... something.... that dog scares me
AI WEEL SEN YU TO JEE-SUS
You don't have to watch finding jesus just talk stupid whit steven he and he will send you there
"You got Fast and Furious?" *We got Fast and Frustrated* 😵
The stranger things reference is so refreshing
You men thin desol
Funny how The Amazing Bulk was an actual movie. It was as successful as Steven's acting career. An absolute FAAIILYA!!!
Are you sure it's not The Amazing Bulk?!
That iPad is the same brand as mine that I'm holding
“Mission Probably not” I just can’t ✋
You got tom Cruise it's tom double decker bus Steven he'slaps hands hard':DDOUBLE DECKER BUS!!??
the funniest part about bulk is that there is a movie called The Amazing Bulk. It's really bad. Like, really bad.
The Incredible Bulk is an actual "movie"  I put movie in quotes because I'm not sure if it's a movie or fever dream
why de hail you have a shot gun
I needed to find Jesus anyway.
No we got slow and tired
does any one see the lever action shootgun in the last cut seen about japenes food
Bone alone is a corn film isn't it.
That movie has potential to be good.
DUDE HOW ABOUT SPIDER MAN
It’s interesting during the skit he had a bandaid over the side of his right eye (left side to the viewer) but during the sponsorship part of the video there was no bandaid
Steven: You got Beijing Corn? Him: We got Beiwing Corn.
"incredible bulk" i’m done bro 😂
I know finding jesus 2 is real but  THAT and Bone Alone I'm not sure
Iron Man = Metal Guy
finding jesus more like finding sanity
The fact he planked and made it funny is the masterpiece.. quote me dudes....

The shotgun in the back during the BOKKSU sponser!
“I will send you to Jesus”  “We’re still looking for him”
Fun fact bone alone is a official spinoff
I wonder if he knows that Finding Jesus is an actual movie. Saberspark featured it in one of his videos much to his dismay.
You got Lego movie   No but we got Duplo short
I watched finding Jesus and I am not pleased.  No, but seriously I watched the full thing I have no idea how I was able to sit through that.
If you had said Amazing bulk i woulda died of laughter which i already was
"i will send you to jesus"
I'd love to watch "Bone Alone" actually....
Sincerely,i would like to have the film "that"

I love the part with the "DOUBLE DECKER BUS"
Finding Jesus and then he says you don't need to worry I will send you to him🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finding Jesus 2 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
FINDING JESUS 2 IS A REAL MOVIE?
You got Godzilla? How about Big Fella? Godzilla vs. Kong? Ape vs. Monster! Jurassic World? Mesozoic Land! And its sequel: Mesozoic Land: Extinction of Man! WHAT IN THE NAME OF TYRANNOSAURUS REX IS THAT???!!!
Yup, I would also get out of there at "The Incredible Bulk", that's actually EMOTIONAL DAMAGE  for people who actually saw it.
“Double decker bus” Caught me dead 💀💀💀
With the right phone apps you can see some of these knockoff movies for free!
God if you watch Finding Jesus drink every time they say Jesus. Makes you forget about the crappy movie you got forced into watching
Who wants to bone alone? Am i righty?

Tom Double Decker Bus. Checks out
" You got *Squid Game?* " " We got *Octopus Game* 🐙 🎮 " Got me so bad

"Do you have Stranger Things?" "We have Weirdo Kids." I mean... he's not wrong...
The way Steven walked out to Incredible Bulk
You have emotional damage  We have mental weapon
bouddha
I wonder if Steven is in pain cuz of the bandage
Don't know if anyone knows this but Bone Alone and Incredible Bulk are actually real.
I like he has different poses when he’s frustrated
Finding Jesus holy Christ sake that’s the funniest thing I could think of right now
Do you have squid game? No we got octopus contest Had me laughing Steven's dad: OCTOPUS YOU SERIOUS YIUVE SEEN SQUIDS OR NOT?
You forgot Snakes on a Train.  Spoiler alert: it's an actual movie.
Didn't the incredible bulk actually exist?
Ma guy literally said "You got fast and furious?" "We've got fast and frustrated" : 💀💀💀

Mission probably not🥲
J E S U S
Based on the research I did, "That" is actually a 2016 movie called Bedeviled, and it just got called "That" in another country to cash on on It (that's just a guess). The evil clown on "That"'s cover is Bedeviled's villain, Mr. Bedevil.  They aren't even similar. Bedeviled's about a haunted APP!
His hot headed brother Christopher *No-air.*
ah yes finding jesus

Shout-out to my boy KSI 😂
Logic: The products that are either a form of copycat or ripoff from an original product with modified names. The name changes can be based on different synonyms, antonyms, or a word that is associated with the same category of the said subject.   Notable examples:   Mountain View: Mountain Dew’s counterpart. Also a soda, only the word “dew” is switched with “view”.  Fire Milk: The opposite of ice cream. This liquid has never dying flames on it and is a rare delicacy, although it has been hazardous for people who consumes it. Fire milk derives from “angriest cow”.   5 Day Depression: 5 Hour Energy’s counterpart. This consumable takes away energy instead, as it does not contain caffeines. Usually used to trick energetic people into consuming this consumable for various reasons depending on the situation.  Bighard: The counterpart of Microsoft. Bighard is one of Microsoft’s competitor that also sells different electronics from computers to phones to pads. Unfortunately, Bighard lacks a significant amount of resources, therefore their products are always poorly received and often defective.   Koala Detour: Panda Express’ counterpart and competitor. Originally founded in Sydney, Australia in 1939 one year after the founding of Panda Express. It also serves as a fast food chains, mostly in Australia but has since expanded to the U.S. They serve Australian Chinese cuisine.   Carpet Damon: The lesser known cousin of Matt Damon. He is also an American Actor, film producer, and screenwriter. Unlike his cousin, Carpett did not rose to fame due to unpopular and low budget movies he was in.   Tournament of Failures: The opposite of the popular multiplayer online game League of Legends. A recent game that was early in the development to challenge the popular counterpart. Rather than focusing of “legends”, this game emphasizes failing, humiliation, and loss of pride.   Special Man: A ripoff version of Superman. Rather than possessing the strengths and weaknesses that Superman has, Special Man instead “cancels” villains. Because of lack of compelling struggles and relatability, Special Man gained very little popularity.   Pigeon and the Summer Nurse: A TV series that is the counterpart to Marvel’s “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier”. The series focuses on an anthropomorphic pigeon that collaborates with a nurse who serves in an army. While the nurse possess advanced combat trainings, the pigeon possess no skills other than “fighting bread”. The series has been criticized for its uninspiring plot and being too kid friendly.   Hairless Ceramic: The ripoff version of Harry Potter, written by K.J Roller. The story focuses on a boy who was blessed by a divine witch by leaving him with a white circle on his forehead. Much like Harry Potter, Hairless Ceramic learns to use magic and attends a magic school. However, he is born evil and possess many negative traits.  Failure Man: The counterpart of Wonder Woman. Like Wonder Woman, he is molded from clay as well, but came out slightly deformed and lower IQ. Failure man does not possess any form of super powers like Wonder Woman and most times he is ridiculed for his failing actions on different occasions.  Trash Can’t: An unusual disposal container. Rather than taking trashes, the container spits out the trash and other discarded items back to is user.  “That”: A ripoff and counterpart of Steven King’s “It”. “That” is about a malevolent entity that takes the form of a large slender man like clown who preys on children. The movie was criticized for being a ripoff of the “It” movie adaptation.  Fast and Frustrated: A film series that is the counterpart and ripoff from Fast and Furious. The series also focuses on actions such as street race, heists, spies, and families. It stars The Sock (counter part to Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson) and Thin Diesel (counterpart of Vin Diesel). Unfortunately, the series has been criticized with lack of actions, acting, inconsistent stories, and over reliance on poor cgi.   Moon Battle: A space opera trilogy that is the rip off to the famous Star Wars trilogy. The trilogy was widely criticized and hated for its inconsistent stories between every movies, poor cgi, poor acting by every actors, and not being compelling. The director for the trilogy was unfortunately killed by a mob of angry fans during the last movie’s opening night.   Tom Double-Decker Bus: The counterpart of Tom Cruise. Double-Decker Bus is an American actor and producer who is famous for starring in the Mission: Probably Not series and many action movies. Unlike Cruise, Double-Decker is extremely afraid of performing real stunts and would always insist advanced CGIs over practical stunts. Because of this, he is widely ridiculed for being the complete opposite of Tom Cruise because of his fear of dangerous stunts and almost all his movies are poorly received.   Christopher Yeslon: The optimistic brother of the critically acclaimed director Christopher Nolan. Like his brother, Yeslon is a British-American director, producer, and screenwriter. Unlike Nolan, Yeslon’s movies do not explore the deep themes of human and always likes to make light hearted movies. He is famous for the Bright Knight trilogy, Outception, Outersteller, and is currently directing the upcoming Clossenheimer. Unlike his brother, Yeslon’s movies are panned by everyone because of his refusal to use any practical effects, cheap actors, uninspiring stories and his movies being too light hearted and shallow. Yeslon has earned many RAZZIE awards as opposed to Nolan’s Academy, Bafta, and Golden Globe awards.

Me watching if everything was off brand rewinding the video 10000 times than dies of laughter your videos are the best keep up the good work Steven!
The incredible bulk being an actually bootleg movie makes it more funny.
My name is christopher
TOM DUBBLE DECUR BUS
Finding Jesus that just sounds like a documentary about the Asian boy that got a b in math
Instead of Fast Frustrated put slow fustrated
Finding Nemo or Finding a slipper
"Do You Have Cars?" "No But We Have Trucks!" "TRUCKS?!"
when everything i off brand *me* what the hell is hapening in the world
KSI 😆😆😆
Fun fact: the incredible Bulk is a real movie
Hahaha! HalleluYah! Praise to Yah for your life! Yahuah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth(Genesis 1:1 In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth) and Yah gave His only brought-forth(begotten) Son, Yahoshua ‘Yah is Salvation’ Messiah(John 3:16 “For Elohim so loved the world that He gave His only brought-forth Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life.) to sweat blood(Luke 22:44 And being in agony, He was praying more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.) and be brutally murdered on a stake(cross) and be resurrected on the third day for the sins of all of humanity!(1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) Follow Yahuah’s 7 easy feast of remembrance and keep Yah’s Sabbath(Day 7; Day of Rest)!   Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’ and His death and resurrection gave us the Gift of the Set-Apart Spirit to be our Guide and Helper to do what is right in Yah’s eyes! Elohim is plural for ‘Mighty Ones’ and Eloah is singular for ‘Mighty One’ and the Arabic word for ‘Elohim’ means ‘Judges and Rulers’   or   ‘Judges or Rulers’! Hallelujah is properly spelled ‘HalleluYah’ which literally means ‘praise to Yah’! Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’! HalleluYah! Yahshua is the Messiah! “Jesus” is Greek for ‘hail Zeus’ and ‘Iesous/Iasous’ is four(4) deities/idols/mighty ones names combined, including the ‘Zeus’! ‘Lord’ is Hebrew for ‘Ba’al’ in every real Hebrew translation! “Christ” is the Greek deity/idol/mighty one ‘Christos’! “God” is “god” is “Gade” is “Gad”, “Ghode” is “Gawd” is the Pagan deity/idol/mighty one of “fortune”! Yeshua/Yehoshua when directly translated from Hebrew to English is Joshua! Amen is the Pagan idol Amen-raw/Amon-raw!
Instead of stranger things a nice a idea is weird tings

Double decker bus oh Emmett would love that since he created the double decker couch
Sorry for my ignorance but what’s up with the band aid?

Real talk tho I really miss movie rental stores
I just can't even tell you how much i feel this video, i used to have to through DVDs people 'donated' pre-c*vid and saw TONS of those bootlegs. Pretty sure the time i take getting rid of them is worth more than the DVDs were, and we got minimum wage (at that time)
Stranger things instead of weird kids it should be failure kids 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
make a part 4 its SOOO funny
"finding jesus 2" hahaha
Let’s just ignore the gun in the background during the sponsorship no need to demonitize
"we got fast and frustrated". 🤣😭💀

yeslin🤣
What about Protectors of the Solar System? Love that movie

0:44  “Oh, you are looking for Jesus?”  *”W E L L  I ’ M  G O I N G  T O  S E N D  Y O U  T O  H I M. ”*
Idk why, but the small 'ksi' killed me. Lol

We dont have the rock, we have the boulder.
Is that why people like the incredible bulk. Cause KSI
The Incredible Bulk is a real movie and is now in my YouTube history. Now it can be in Yours: https://youtu.be/svR0e-lp4tA
How was finding Jesus 1 so successful that they made finding Jesus 2
0:35 I love how abrupt the "I don't care" is lmao. Like he's 2 movies in and he's already fed up  Also "finding Jesus" looks exactly like a Christian parody movie I would have had to watch in Sunday school
What Adam Sandler movies you got   Oh do you mean Eve Dirter
Ideas for another off-brand video: FedEx -> AteWhy Amazon Prime -> Forest Prime Steven He -> Stephen She  More: Fish Tank = Shark Tank but cheaper (Starring Mr.Great, the not so creative brother of Mr. Wonderful) York Wizowski, Mike Wizowski's cousin in law Wallgreens -> Floorreds or Celingreds Publix -> Classifidz Home Depot -> Vacation Depot Ikea -> Ukea Instagram -> Infinipound Facebook -> Footdiary Bill Gates' not so famous twin, Bill Doors Mark Zuckerberg's illegal clone, Erase Zuckerberg Windows -> Blinds Mr. Beast's older sister Mrs. Animal Polar Express -> Equator Train Slow and Smiley = Fast and Furious, but ultra kid-friendly Santa Claus -> Santa Nails
I don't buy bokksu, I buy containertrial
subscribe to Alex She
You got home alone no but we got apartment single you got finding nemo  No we have losing nemo

“Do you have Disney+”                                          “No we have thatleg-“
WHY DID I HEAR MAKERS AS THE N WORD
as a person who watched the incredible bulk, id say its a masterpiece
when everything is off brand nothing is
Where can i buy Yeslin movies!?
it's so funny when he says I Will Send You To Jesus 🤠
How about "Emotional Damage"  We have "Mental Pain"
Imagine this if he just showed porn parody movie titles
He started teleporting from how off brand it is
#IllSendYouToJesus
I was literally talking to my friend Jesus before this video
If he was there a little bit longer he would’ve said”KSI”
1:01 huge missed opportunity to say: "Vin Gasoline"
should have said the amazing bulk in referance ton the actual knock off movie
You got the hulk  No we got the green boy                      I tried
*Christopher Yeslan*
“You got Ironman” “Nah we got Samsung”

The legendary Incredible Bulk!?
This Guy is a fucking Legend. I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS!!!
Keep it up Steven this is some comedy gold 😄 🤣
Instead of ritz crackers there is Golden rounds (it is a real thing)
That slipper is the main character of this channel
I was going to ask why is there a bed in a video store but I think that's what they all needed & it's why they went bust. Ever look for too long & then start feeling a bit sick!? Beds would have solved that.
I was waiting for the cashier to say after he said i will send you to jesus “oh you mean the fish jesus?”
Incredible Bulk. All jokes were amazing.
Metal guy made me burst out laughing
Funny thing is that incredible bulk is a actual movie
"Do you have Al Pacino?" "We've got Macchiato."
click to watch video; enjoy reactions in ad even more
"I go watching Marvel Movie!" "We have DC."
Fiji water is good tho
MAKE THESE MARVEL ONES STOP PLEEEEEEEASE!!!!!! i know its just a joke but i feel some part of my abnormaly large marvel love feeling attacked by this
At 0:14 the translation says “Trauma. Inevitable shocking horror following Stephen King’s original “IT”
You could’ve said thin petrol, but i guess opportunity lost.
The rifle in the background of the Sponsorship was the bets bit.
ok but finding jesus "😃"
The more you watch the more you understand.
When you don't know most of the actors Steven said but it's still so funny:
Why you like the word "jesus"
Bulk... hulk
Bone Alone sounds like a porno.... Same with Fast and Frustrated
But what's off-brand KSI?  Ignorance Weakness... I don't know.
As soon as you said Marvel movies, I realized I'd seen you before I started watching all your skits in a KSI reddit video.
idea  do you have McDonald's   we have O'Brians
Oh yay its finding jesus my favorite!
* 2:45 pewpew
Eeeyyyyyy i dig that lever gun. Is it a 30-30?

Vin diesel - lose petrol
I will never understand what 1:03 means
KSI as the incridible BULK.
Do you got Breaking Bad? No we do got fixing good
I always show Incredible Bulk when I have girls over.
Why does he always have a bandaid in these videos?
"It has KSI"
I have the same case for my iPad
Funny that there *IS* a bad movie called the incredible bulk. Train wreck of a movie.
It's actually the amazing bulk...
Hey you got the movies with uuuh Vin Diesel?  Oh yeah you mean Lose Gasoline
Basically Aldi but expensive
Me: Y'all got Wreck It Ralph? Them: No but we got Retro Paul
The fact Bone alone and Incredible Bulk are real just makes this funnier.
I love how it slowly gets more cursed...
Jurassic world < dinosaur world
He planks lol
Hi
He said it wrong because it not KSI its his optimistic brother...PSY
That laughing 😂 at the END! 🤣🤣🤣
The bongs tho
he shouldve done 'thin petrol'
"Finding Jesus 2! Friends, Family and Faith under the sea! Only on Magical Castle July 28th!"
Steven on the time 2:50 why is there a gun above your door?

The Amazing Bulk is actually a thing. https://youtu.be/ywaR-Lq_ayk You're welcome.
Hilarious
Slow and frustrated*
Do one with celebrities on a (talk) show or cast. Like instead of Jerry Seinfeld, Jimmy autograph pasture (feel free to use that one, just give me credit 😉)
Waiting for Jesus 1 He never came back so they had to make a sequel and guess what HE NEVER RETURNED
Plank 🧍‍♂️
He should do one where he tricks the guy with the off brand to get what he wants.
It made me laugh so hard
The Incredible Bulk is an actual movie🤣
Why do these go so hard?
Hey Steven He! I have some Off Brand ideas for “When everything is off brand.” I don’t expect for you or anyone to read this so bear with me…  “Do you the X-Box?” “No, but we do have X-Girlfriend.”  “What the hell X-Girlfriend?  I don’t even have a girlfriend… *Goes into plank mode* Do you have the Nintendo Switch?” “We have the Pintendo Control.”  “Pintendo Control?! I will send you to Jesus! Do you have the Sega Genesis?” “No, but we do have the Nintendo Bible.”  “Nintendo Bible?! This isn't a church! The PlayStation?” “We have the MusicEquipment.”  “Game Boy?” “We do have the Contest Girl.”  “Do you have the Television?” “No, but I think you will like this one a lot we have the Tele-blindness.”   “Tele-blindness! What the hell-?! Do you have the iPhone?” “We have the i-Sound.  “i -Sound?! Do you have the iPad?“ “We do have the i-Paper.”  “i-Paper?! This isn’t a tree?! *Goes into a karate formation.* I will send you to Jesus! A Camera?” “No but I think you’ll like this one the Storage-deleter.”  “Storage-deleter? Do you have a Computer?” “We have Calculating Grass.”  “Calculating Grass! *Plank mode* Ok how about the Oculus?” “We have Facebook.”  “Facebook? Isn’t it the social media platform?! Never mind then how about AirPods?” “We have Carbon Plants.”  “Carbon Plants?! This is not nature but I will “send you to Jesus! Do you at least have the game Minecraft?” “…No, but we do have the Build-Destroy.”  “Build-Destroy?! The most popular game?! Ok you possibly can’t mess this one up… Roblox?” “…We have the Keyboard Destroyers.”  “Ok I am about to “Send you to Jesus!” Last one how about Among-us?” “We have the Separation-one.”  *Steven He sends worker to Jesus…*  I really hoped you like some of my ideas if not tell me your ideas? If you read this far… you are a champion have some water and touch some grass, lol! 😂😑

What offended me was this was a golden opportunity to use "The Amazing Bulk" but you didn't do that!  *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE*
I laughed the most on finding jesus 2 XD
I like your videos, but not swearing or using God's name in vain.  Hence, I liked this video & am happy to share it.  =)  You're a funny guy!
I felt the aggressive frustration-planking in my soul.
I have deep depression and few things makes me laugh, this channel is one of these thank you Xtoven Who
"You got Super Mario Bros?" "We got Super Mid Bros"

1:04 THATS THIN DIESEL
Fell out of my skin laughing!
sooooo funny!!!
The best part about the Home Alone joke? Bone Alone is technically an actual part of the Home Alone series, to memory. Meaning it's not actually off-brand. You say that ruins the joke, I say tomato(tuh-may-der), but what I mean is that it's so far removed it might as well be and that's great-
Dude I would take Figi water over Aquafina any way of the week
KSI LMAO IM DEAD
I will send you to Jesus is great

The fact that "the incredible bulk" actually exists as a rip off version of the Hulk movie just search it up and it exists
Endless laughter 😂😂

Bone alone, really Stevan            Nice
"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....".   "A Sith lord who is the father of a failure named Steven who became a Jedi enters a store"  "You got any Lightsabers?" He asks an employee working there.  "Yeah, Totally its hung up on that wall over there" He answers the failure's father.  Steven's father picks up the saber He turns on the saber. The hilt glows red and orange with heat. Steven's father drops it. The light it's emitting makes the Engraving on the saber more visible it says Glowsword.  "Hey it says Glowsword over here on it"  "Oh, Well they put the Kyber Crystal in the wrong way and it made the hilt glow red and orange so they called it the glow sword.  "What about ranged weapons. You have any uh blasters?"  "Absolutely, It's in the Ranged weapons section."  Steven's father picks up blaster and uses it to shoot a Jedi about to enter the store. He falls unconscious. He reads the Engraving on it. It says shooter.  "...at least it knocks them unconscious"  "Surely you have Disney, My favorite the uh Earth wars"  "Ah that's one of my favorites as well it's right beside you."  Steven's father reads the name it says "Dirt wars".   Steven's father picks up the shooter saying "I will send you to Jesus"

I don’t think the video store owner needs to be sent to Jesus considering he has a copy of Finding Jesus 2 in his store
its funny how Steven He's got a musket in the backround when he is doing a sponsor at the end of the video, I wonder if he will use it in a video.

The funny thing is, Finding Jesus is actually a real movie, and it is literally a shitty, blatant copy of Finding Nemo

Steven He for world leader.
Emotional Damage for roasts and I will send you to Jesus for videos that make you angry or annoyed
Look up the incredible Bulk. It’s the funniest failure...  ... you won’t enjoy it unless you’re drunk and/or with friends.

I wanna watch "fast and frustrated" honestly 😁

Finding Jesus two would be a Perfect movie to watch with my family.
My villain Schcool
aaa big up ksi just reacted to your video
“Bone alone”  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm…   That could make a good… wholesome show
For the next one i suggest When Everything is Off Brand (Anime/Manga Edition) Example:  Dragon Ball -> Lizard Cube One Piece -> 2 Slice Bleach -> Detergent Fullmetal Alchemist -> Halfwood Naturist Beyblade -> GyroKnife But for other titles like Yu-Gi-Oh!, Naruto, Pokemon might b harder to change 😅
my favourite bit is "I will send u to jesus"
Bone Alone is a bad movie
OCTUPUS CONTEST FOR SQUID GAME 😭
“I will send you to Jesus.” “DOUBLE DICKER BUS?”
What about Thursday 2th that was a classic
The jab at Fiji water caught me off guard
@steven He sorry if this is offensive...? but why do you always have a bandaid on your eye?
squid game more like calamari contest
U have Slow and depressed ?
Bone alone is actual movie
"Fast and Frustrates" F&F irl
You got Harry Potter and the Crystal Turtle? :)

Moon Battle Episode 3: Payback of The Sixth
The random poses
Why he isn't *vin petrol* instead
KSi was violated lmao
Double decker bus lol
1:23 why does it sound like the beginning of a Disney song
Does Steven know the Incredible Bulk is a real movie and one of the worst things to ever be put on TV
Haha
AMAZING 🤩🤩
I didn't realize Asians really said hiya until I heard it on a dash cam recording the other day and instantly thought of your videos.
The Incredible bog, featuring Allowit Man, Syed Kick and (our favourite heroine) Simon
oh gosh the music he puts on when he starts talking about the sponsor, gives me flashbacks when i used to watch paulsorausjr... good video tho
"The one with the Ferrari?" "Yeah, the Prius!" This line had me crying out of tummy aches.
Steven's thesaurus page visits after this video 📈📈
You should name a big youtuber and then go "we have the failure version, Steven He" lmao that wouldve killed me
The threat of the slipper XD bwahahahahaha
Its not a mistace its a masterpiece
"That's thin diesel."  *planking intensifies*

I think it should be called: Operation: Probably not
“Finding Jesus 2” lol
“Finding Jesus 2” lol
the best
1:23 😂😂😂😂😂
Stop mocking Jesus Christ (pbuh). We muslims and christians both love him. He is one of the best men to walk on earth. What will you get my mocking him? What did he do to you? Because of you, westerners, even the muslim brothers of mine has started to mock him. They have been blinded. You won't understand the pain unless the closest person to you will make fun of the person you can die for. If you don't like religion, stay away from it. No one gave you the right to mock about them.
you didn't even see the games! here are my top ten: 10: counter strike local defensive 9: Thursday morning opera 8: empty knight bug 7: poki poki math study group 6: bellnautica (the one with the spaceship aura that sank in the ocean) 5: civilian evil 8 (the one with the big zombie lady) 4: craftmine (from molang) 3: hyper Bruno bros. (the first one that came out for Notendo amusement machine) 2: five days at teddy's (the one that scout coffin made) 1: abovetale and gammasigil (toby bear is the best gamedev ever)
"I will send you to Jesus." Remove J and E from Jesus, the result is quite suspicious.
Oh my god. The parts with the planking and the zoom in, pure comedy gold.
KSI violation was elite 😂😂
*T o m D o u b l e D e c k e r B u s* *C h r i s t o p h e r Y e s l i n* hm yes best actors ever
"I will send you to Jesus"

The episode that you make is hilarious  But I'd like to see who comment me, how much steven he said EMOTIONAL DAMAGE. Pls i want to know
I will send you to Nemo
i like how he shows practically no emotion at all

It's like searching on Bing😂😂😂
"Don't call me it's Tom Cruise"  "It's with Tom Double Decker Bus" I almost died of laughter.
As we know, Steven's dad has the power to send anyone to Jesus. He does not need to find Jesus.
"I will send you to Jesus" always gets me
Finding Jesus wtf the only thing i accept here is bone alone
Plot twist he was going to send him to jesus but he had to find him
I loved the bulk movie!
"The one with the ferrari?" "The one with the p R i U s"
Man you are literally the first YouTuber that made me lose a don't laugh challenge
I showed my frend finding Jezus 2 he starter laughing soo bad
"Double decker bus?!"  Mans looking like a double decker bus in that pose   Dont question it
I think instead of fast and frustrated it should be quick and frustrated
I spat a bit of tea. Thanks Steven. Also, the real question is: How often does Steven say out loud: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE, without laughing himself into a choke state?
1:31
Its just something about off brand products that feel emotionally damaging
that :tm:
1:04 My exact reaction to learning that not only is "Finding Jesus" a real f*cking movie, but that someone thought it could use a sequel
You have the new KSI movie?   We have LTJ
“Double Decker Bus!”🤣🤣🤣
Damn it’s been a while since I’ve genuinely laughed at videos like this 😅😂
I Wil Send You To Jesus Is Funy
You got Tomb Raider? We have Grave Robber  You have Lethal Weapon? We have Harmless Tool.  You have Kung Fu Panda? We have Martial Arts Koala.
Sad thing is the incredible bulk is an actual movie I once saw it. It is hilarious
SAPKA!!!!!!!
the incredible Bulk 😂
My friend just calls squid game octopus activities
Mission probably not 😂
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I can't believe you didn't say "The Incredible Bulk" starred Mark Smoothalo...
i will send you to jesus
His videos are always funny
Bone alone is actually a movie, russian movie Ёлки мохнатые.
1:19 never gets old
You have chocolate chip? We got vanilla cheap.
Incredible is an actual knock off movie
Would like to see offbrand Steven He 😏
1:20

Incredible Bulk is a movie, Red Letter Media reviewed it a while ago
You should do when things are offbrand but it's singers/artist
"You got Steven He?" "We got Steven She"
"I will send you to Jesus" is the most threatening quote. I quiver in fear every time I hear it.

One of these days, when the last joke is in these off brand videos, we're going to hear a gun click off screen.
"We don't have an exit, but we have an entrance!"
Man’s should’ve done Onward but it’s Homeward
Fast & furius - fast & frustrated  The rock The sock  Star wars moon battle  Mission impossible - mission probably  not
This is funny XD

I pray you grow more faster.. you deserves millions of subscriber. You are hilarious af.. And i am glad I have found you 😊
2:03 HE SAID THE N WORD LISTEN CLOSELY
I watched your videos a month ago and I was lol the whole time.  My 17 years old was the one who found them and I have to give them t to you is something we can watch, laugh and comment there isn't weird black humor or 2nd meanings implied so on. However I really would like that give a suggestion if I may I have no clue 🗝️ f you are a believer or no I couldn't NOT notice that you use the Name of Jesus name above all names a name that's Holy and that's the way to be mentioned in God words or prayers. I get it's funny the video I send you to.. what if is change for I send you to Heaven. I send you to the sky. Anything and we give the place of respect the Holy name of our Savior deserves. My humble opinion. Thank you Steven He you are Hilarious and Awesome.
Fun fact: The incredible bulk is an actual movie that was aired in a movie theater, failed miserably, and has never been shown to the public again. U can even look it up
Plz never die or stop uploading
I'm new here, why does he have a bandage on the side of his face?
The costumer: Do you have any marvel movies(spiderman, iron man,hulk,etc) Cashier: oh yes we have sharvel(arcanakid,metal lady,bulk,etc)
What if the off-brands…we’re off-brands
I love that you have a model 94 just hanging on your wall. Huge fan! Keep it up!
The finding Jesus 2 got me falling of laughter
The way the movie finding Nemo was finding Jesus
“I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS” Best quote ever

You have maze runner? We have Labrynth Walker. You have Hunger Games? We have Starving Sport.

Hey @Steven He can you do a off brand but it marvel movie. Like Hulk into Bulk, Dr. strange : Mr. Weirdo.
Should "Fast and Frustrated" have been "Brisk and Frustrated"? Or "Slow and Happy"?  Your dad: You are a failure at being a failure!
finding jesus 😂😂😂
Misson Impossible Misson Probably Not
YOOOOO I LITERALY HAVE THE SAME IPAD LOLOLOL
Mission PROBALY MADE ME LAUGH
The good old Tom Doubledeckerbuss
I mean Fast and Furious are Fast and Frustrated movie franchise.
I fucking love how he tapped into Charlie's bottled water tier list, just to make one joke on this video. Incredible stuff.
“the incredible bulk” this will be recorded in history
So pretentious
Tom double decker bus...damn, now I have heard everything
I will send you to jesus
Finding jesus and what a lovely  brand
This amused me as it takes you back to when there were actually things called video stores and they did really stock some horrendous rip-off (with really badly illustrated box art and terrible pun titles). Really nice that you did something for old guys like me who can still remember this! LOL 👍
Mission probably not 😂😂 This is gold
Incredible bulk got ksi 😂😂😂
Steven, you are probably aware but your emotional damage has became a meme all over the internet. I saw it in Uncle Roger and to my surprise in Dr. Mike's vid 😂
It should have been psi instead of ksi
I will send you to Jesus!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me:Steps on my moms foot my mom: I will send you to Jesus
0:34 1:15

How about this?   Steven He: "Do you have 'Rampage'? Owner of the store: "Yes, we have 'Lambbook'
You didn't said Slow and Frustrated
Octopus contest 😂😂😂🤣🤣
What is the sponsered instrumental music from ?
For anyone who doesn’t know, the Incredible Bulk is an actual thing, and yes it’s as bad as it sounds
I heard ksi on the last and i was dead laughing!       Keep up the good work

Steven looks like u got hurt during the making of this vid

Bruh took the plank challenge to another level

"We could have streamed at home but we need this for the plot" this one made me laugh
What really made me crack up is how he said Fin Diesel🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 also you're the guy who is notorious for "Emotional Damage" 😀🤣😅😶‍🌫😜🥲😭😡

"Bone alone" sounds like my Sex life tbh...
Sorry I was trying to find Jesus. If anyone knows where he is, can you send me to him?
Those who are going to be sent to Jesus probably should watch this 0:46
Mission Probably not was gold
Its nice to see u grow, I remember when u had around 500k subs and u are so hilarious
I wonder if there is an off-hand for this channel 🤔
Do you have frozen. We have ice queen
Dolphin voice in the end blooper would have been way more MEME LIKE **
"This video is brought to you by Bokksu" It's probably offbrand too
Finding jesus 😂
Double Decker Bus!? Christopher Yesland!?

Fast and Frustrated! 😂😂😂
Finding Jesus bruh hahahaha
0:11 , 0:04 ok I don't know if it is just me or not, but in this part where part of his head in the left (our perspective) kinda looks unnatural or have been cut and pasted, it also looks as if the face was deepfaked.      So if my theory is correct, the face we see in Steven He's videos isn't the same face as the one acting the skits? Or maybe it's just for this video, well idk I'll let you guys decide...
half expected bagkksu
Do anime
Anime
"Bone Alone"   😳
THE MISSION PROBABLY NOT? BRUUUUVV
0:35 1:40

Steven he:I will send you to Jesus In mother Russia:Jesus is sent to you  In America :God bless America
DOUBLE DECKER BUS!?!?

"Double Decker Buss!!!!!"..😀😀
Mission Impossible  Assignment Unlikely

I died at Christopheryeslin
finding jesus 2 and the incredible  bulk are actual movies
This was in KSI's newest video!
bruh i'm still finding jesus
pretty sure "finding jesus" is a real movie.
John 3:15-17 (KJV)  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
Can we just appreciate that lever action above the doorway to the kitchen
Forget "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE" for now   look at "DOUBLE DECKER BUS"
*DOUBLE DECKER BUS*
can we appreciate how clean and beautiful his room is
This man has gained like three million subs in a year
KSI reacted to the incredible bulk lol
Incredible bulk, my favorite green superhero
Glad they found Jesus so that he can send them there
What happened to Arachnid Boy?

Seriously, Steven, thank you for making me laugh in these hard times.  I couldn't imagine a world without your humor.  Love you, bro'!
As someone who has Asian friends, I got that slipper joke.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
My dude straight up defined gravity in all those positions
It would be funny if he said "Finding Sushi" for the finding nemo movie🤣
Finding Jesus 2 would've been a very short movie if Steven's dad had been in it
Steven's dad: CHRISTOPHER YESLAND!!!
Dude man, c'mon.... 🤣

“Finding Jesus” I’m so glad I didn’t have Protestant parents. I got to avoid crap like that lol. *this post was brought to you by Catholic gang*
Steven's dad should just ask for the off brand thing and they will give the on brand thing.
You cant send him to Jesus you need to find him first.

Steven He, Bringing back Planking one video at a time.
That "Finding Jesus 2" movie is a horror film of its own right, given how bad the voice acting, animation, and practically everything else about it is so low budget and a blatant knockoff of Finding Nemo.
embrace the meow meow
DOU-BLE DEC-KER BUSS!!??

How he dissed ksi at the end
Hmm sounds familiar
"I will send you to Jesus" 😂😂
Why didn’t he buy finding Jesus 2
"I send you to Jesus" really should have gone back to "Finding Jesus 2".
i think Steven He got Emotional Damage when hearing the marvel 2
1:22 I think that's how you find Jesus.
"Finding Jesus 2." There was a Finding Jesus 1?!

OMG PLZ come to BiliBili ASAP！So many people in China loves you！
Hi Steven I want to be a youtuber like you could I be your appreciate
2:04 ayo what did you say??
Could we say that the off brand version of Steven He is Uncle Roger?
Jesus is Lord. God bless. He loves and Forgives. God someone who waits for your downfall, but your redemption through His Son Jesus. Repent. This may seem uncalled for but just trust the Lord. Give God a chance, not being religious but have a relationship with God. Call out to Him and try and hear His voice in your heart, He doesn’t go against His Word, the Bible. If you reject it, ay your choice, God gives free will. Just got to say, He has plans to prosper you not to harm you. Again ain't saying be religious, but give God a chance. God bless you.
God tier comedy
Who else started watching at 220k subscribers

When you run out of idea part 3 -
Squid game should have been shrimp work
If he started making videos sooner he would of saved 2020🥺
ITS GOT KSI- THAT SENT ME
I see thus becoming a new meme "i will send You to Jesus"
I wonder what happened to his eye
I feel like the next "When Everything is Off Brand 4 is gonna be realated about games and I feel one of them would be like "Do you have Fortnite?" "Yes we have Forknife." and another one would be like "Do you have Apex Legends?" "Oh yes we have Gaypex Leg ends
Got Mission Impossible? we got operation probably not
How does a fish find Jesus pls help my fish wants to send me to Jesus.
The fact that the names are just the opposite of the words in it make it really off brand.
“You got Al Pacino” “We have macchiato” I’m dying
Probably no MicroSoft, just MacroHard
1:04 My man just went perpendicular over “Thin Diesel”
TF IS SPACE BATTLE
Slow and the frustrated
Shouldve been slow and frustrated instead
I think you mean KSY
LMAO
You should check out Timmy He
Anyone sending off brands to Jesus
How bout grinding Nemo
It’s not thin diesel it’s thin gas
LOL
I love these videos because this was always what my brothers and I did when naming movies to see how much we could confuse each other. Frozen -> Freezed, Treasure Planet -> Money Rock etc
More
I was dying when he said christopher yeslan
It is funny when Steve and he said double-decker bus
Incredible Bulk is an actual movie (I think. It might have been amazing bulk) It featured this purple fat hulk guy and the worst acting I can think of

“Find Jesus 2”  “dis knee 2022
Random sales man: Hi want to buy some you? (Off brand Wii) Me remembering Steven: I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS

This is the funniest video I’ve ever seen
So if Steven is off brand.....       Captain failure?
We love how everything is real brand
The incredible bulk is a real thing refuses to elaborate
"DOUBLE DECKER BUS!?" P e r f e c t I o n
You should use “you got sour patch kids? We got sweet bandage adults” in your next video
POV: your waiting for finding Jesus to launch
You probably don’t want that box, Japan approves the most food additives in the world that are banned in most countries.
2:05 this entire part just shows how much fun this guy has making videos
The iconic thing in this channel is "Emotional Damage" And "I will send you to Jesus" 😂✨
The on brand: Steven he The off brand: jacub him
I personally prefer the tungsten gentleman over metal guy
I WILL SEND YOU TO JESES is my favorite quote and the finding Jesus 2 just made me laugh so hard
The fish in Finding Jesus met Steven's dad, he's just trying to find him after being sent to him.
When is finding Jesus 3 realising? I gotta watch it lmao
Do you have Rich Black Guy? No we have wealthy dark person.
You got mission impossible we got quest doable
DOUBLE DECKER BUS! had me DEAD
Okay this is somewhat accurate. because the movie can be different depending on the region
Whats even better is that some of the movies are actually real

"DOUble DECker BUS"

"Fast and Furious" could've been "Quick and Angry"
Finding Jesus 2😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

When you find out that Finding Jesus 2 is a real movie: so it's not photoshopped.
Don’t watch “Finding Jesus.” it’s a sin in EVERY religion.
“The incredible bulk.. it has ksi..” 🤣🤣
I want merch that says :I will send you to Jesus" with him doing the slipper 🤣

P L A N K   P O S E
The incredible bulk was amazing and Steven mentioning ksi bulking was halarious
also you made a meme the “EMOTIONAL DAMAGE?!” Thing, even preston used the eme and SSSniperwolf
Why the bandage?
Steven's dad: u got superman? Storekeeper: Ah yes, we have faliurekid just over there. Steven's dad: *sees his son*
*Steven looking for Finding Nemo*   Finds : Finding Jesus 2  Steven : "that will be my son"
I would personally like to watch "the incredible bulk" I'm interested in what role does KSI play
nhiệm vụ bất khả thi no it's nhiệm vụ có thể ko

"CHRISTOPHER YESLAN" - Steven He's dad, 2022
Double-Decker-bus I’m super dead😂😂😂
you should've linked the "finding Jesus" and "I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS" somehow together,  make these two jokes connected,
There is an ‘amazing bulk’ I’ve seen it, it’s great

'Ending Jesus 2' get me laugh for some reason
"Mission probably not" That got me hard
Live slowly

At this point just ask for a asian movie.
Hello Steven He! Tomorrow is my birthday so. Please wish me in a video tomorrow or make a funny video please!!! Thank you!!
Steven he is so powerful he can send people to jesus with a flip flop
The incredible bulk is actually a thing
The incredible bulk from JJ community we approve
My man started to lag as his brain was starting to break down( 1:05 )

“Incredible bulk features ksi” 🤣
1:22 the return of “I will send you to Jesus”
Everyone in my year knows this channel every time I go to one of my classes I hear "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE" or "I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS"
I actually want to watch some of these movies like “metal guy” his name should be Baloney Spark

(Me crying because I'm not Asian so I'm not worthy of the snacks)

When he said "this moderpuck" AAAAA HAHAHAHA I LAUGH
The KSI joke was good lmao
Hey, sending me to Jesus won't be a bad thing.. cause.. it just means I'm in heaven forever with Him! Hehe 😋 I love that quote!
Better if “do have the rock? You mean Sock?” Is “do have the rock? You mean stone?”
1:21
I was expecting Vin Kerosene but Thin Diesel works better 😂
Best moment  Steve -: u got time cruise  Salesman-: we got Tom double decker bus Steve -: DOUBLE DECKER BUSSSS

That's that Man who says emotional damage
China in a nutshell:
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Steven out here bringing back planking
Dude, it would have been so funny if Vin Diesel was Vin Gasoline
Somewhere out there is an off-brand version of myself
How long does it take for you to come up with these?
HAHAHA His videos are hilarious！！！It makes me laugh🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When he said thin diesel i laughed so hard i was sent to jesus
Ah yes, “Finding Jesus”
We don't have octopus contest we have tentacle workspace
I saw an actual video on Finding Jesus. It's not worth it, and apparently involves a racist stereotype Japanese chef dude..yeah..
For no one that understands the KSI joke it’s that after he beat Logan Paul in their 2nd match he decided to start bulking and get bigger and people made fun of him for it
it's even funnier if you're Asian.
Mildly disappointed he wasn't holding the Finding Jesus movie when he said sending him to Jesus...
E
LMFAOO
We have lose petrol
Aquafina? “We got Fiji water” I like how he ignored that it was better than the original one he asked for.
Emotional damage
YO idk if you know but I am SURE you heard that in discord and else in gif menu you can search EMOTIONAL DAMAGE and as a result it will be YOUR EMOTIONAL DAMAGE (like when difficulty is asian)
The incredible bulk is a real thing, look it up
1:29 that totally killed me

0:44 I guess this is what happens to everyone Steven’s dad meets. They try to find Jesus.
The incredible bulk is a real movie. It has a bad cgi purple fat thing. It has stock video. It has a lady groping the bulk for some reason. Look it up. It is on the edge of so bad it’s good and so bad it’s just really bad.
The planking made me pass on to the next life 🤣😂🤣

“Bone Alone” sounds like a sad romance movie.

Can I get a copy of "Finding Jesus" pls?
"Christopher yeslin"had me like 😂😂😂
DOUBLE. DECKER. BUS?!

This video is sponsored by steal dark legends
The Incredible Bulk is basically a real movie but it's called The Amazing Bulk
I absolutely lost my shit when he said "Fast and Frustrated"
"You know, I used to walk up town down hill two ways with 1 leg.. **just to get to my chair**
"We could have streamed movies from home but it's for the plot. " I died laughing. wait hold the phone he disrespected spider man again, be dead 💀
I turned on subtitles and for “Vin diesel” it said “Ventilation” 💀

_The Incredible Bulk_ isn't so far away from the real thing, actually.

Oof dam saying KSI is a bulk 😂😂
He is so adorable
I love EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Home alone should of been 'homeless together'
You got my nefew?  *We got your son*
Emotion o damej
"Incredible Bulk"? How long until he learns that those two words are the title of a Totally Spies episode? Can't blame him, easy joke name to make.
I’m glad he used thin desil instead of vin gasoline
I must say tho, Bone Alone is a great movie
Lol the plank reaction was amazing. 🤣  Omg I would love a Bokksu so much. I need a new job.
The lying on random furniture was the greatest part
omg no not the incredible bulk- its an actual movie and its about a purple much less proportionized hulk, and it got laptop lizards.. you dont know what laptop lizards are? exactly
The Incrtedible Bulk was a real film btw. Made largely with internet stock footage.
my whole school is saying   EMOTIONAL DAMAGE

The incredible bulk… we got KSI 😭😭
Me trying to find a comfortable sleeping position at 3:00 AM:

why is there a gun in the background 👀
Cheese
Nothing like making popcorn, sitting down and binge watching all of Steven He's videos
Steven's dad should try to go buy a Bruce Lee movie. He's going to find Bruce Li, Bruce Le, Dragon  Lee, and even a knockoff where he fights with Chick Norris
Shameless
"IM NOT FAT IM BULKING"- Olajide Olatunji

1:21
Yayyyy new Steven vid
Please when Asian is difficulty mode 4
I'm not going to send you to Jesus. I will send you to heaven. because the videos you make are really nice 😃 thank you so much
Wow....  you actually do have a joke that isn't about Asian people.  It's still not funny, but at least it's not the same crap you always do.  It's the other crap you always do.
“I will send you to Jesus”
Imma make some memes out of this🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow,I didn't know you had a gun.Now I am scared 2:46
finding beano and its just a cooking show episode where someone just keeps throwing cans of baked beans at people
I can’t believe 3 million people subbed and I didn’t notice
Steven’s Dad: Do you have Brave? Cashier: We have fear. Steven’s Dad: Princess and the frog? Cashier: Peasant and the Toad.  Steven’s Dad: Up? Cashier: Down. Steven’s Dad: Finding Dory? Cashier: Finding Moses. Steven’s Dad: That’s it, I’m going to Best Buy. Cashier: You mean….. Worst Refund?  Like For More!
Comedic Genius
🙏 Finding Jesus 2 🙏 had me audibly laughing
This guy reminds me of nigahiga
Atg for gta
We need emotional damage shirts and coffee mugs added to your merch store! Make this happen please, don't be a FAILURE!!!
1:05 I thought he was floating!! 😂
Love the super casual “Aquafina? We’ve got Fiji Water.” burn 😂
Planking out of sheer frustration is just next level
"I will send you to Jesus!"
These knockoffs makes me want to Find Jesus 2
" we could have streamed movies at home but we need this for the plot" haha
That’s so weird those people have a dressing a on the same eye. I have a theory they might be twins or the even the same person
"People love the incredible bulk, it's got........KSI" got me
Imagine One beautiful day when Steven He shows us his real father.
Weirdo kids made me laughing so hard 😂
1:20
snow white would be summer black change my mind
"I will send you to jesus" is my msg tone, no cap!! Love your vids
Asian joke  You are so stupid, Light bends around you -Stevens Dad, Art of Failure
Just gonna pretend I haven't seen ksi try and teach tommyinnit how to ride a bike
I wanna see "if Asian was a difficulty 4" and I want it 1.000.000% comedy😂😂😂
😂 🤣 😆
How does the background look like a greenscreen while actually being a real room he's recording in?  Edit: When I first watched this after it came out I was genuinely shocked when he did the plank bit (while simultaneously laughing my ass off at the bit) because I thought it was a green screen background.
shld hv been vin "petrol"
Im dumb
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE !!!!!
The Tom Double Decker Cruise had me dying of laughter 😂😂😂
KSI, the incredible bulk
Nice
Bone Alone - that's an actual movie. And it is terrible
I went on akinator and he guessed you in 19 questions and not 21
Finding Jesus isn't off brand . most Christian film have a low budget. They probably just thought it was a great idea to name it finding Jesus because of kids . But the plot isn't  that similar
The fact about steven videos are that every asian can relate to it especially the parents one's
I swear u had a million subs a few days ago, now u have 3 million?! That’s awesome dude
People love the incredible bulk INCREDIBLE "BULK"??? lol lmao bruh bruh
Lol I have the same tablet
you should uninvent physics by throwing a slipper 300 years back in time and make issac newton die I mean pass out
Bone Alone sounds like a movie To me
bro wutt happened to ur forehead
Lol love the way you brought ksi in it 😂😂😂.
The planking is a spectacular performance from the table to the edge of the bed. Rating: 1 Bamboo Pole and 4 pairs of slippers.😊
And my all time favorit Abibas
Finding Jesus should of been dining nemo

All jokes aside, I would watch a movie about a dog named Bone alone on Christmas, fighting against home intruders with whacky scooby doo traps 😂
Second comment * pleaseeeee do a Dr. STRANGE or Spider-man spoof pleasee.  I love you 🥺😂🥺😂🥺
0:45 I want to watch “Finding Jesus 2” 😂

EmOtIoNaL dAmAgE!!!
DOUBLE DECKER BUS💀😂
finding jesus  XD
“finding jesus 2” and that’s the moment where everyone dies     …to find jesus
Fun fact: The reason “Finding nemo” Is “Finding Jesus” Is because nemo backwards is “omen” which sound similar to “Amen”
Did he just mention KSI
Man missed the opportunity to say “quick and frustrated”
Yo Steven, I want mission probably not, you know, the one with Tom DOUBLE DECKER BUS

'I will send you to *"finding jesus"*
The Incredible Bulk IS an actual movie tho. Microwave Society watched it. WORS- er, BEST movie ever.
“Fast and the Frustrated, FindingJesus” LOL!!! I watched this 3 times I laughed so hard!
One of these days, Steven's Dad gonna say "I'll send you to Jesus!" And the shopkeeper will be like, "Finally! We do have that movie!"
my mum buying movies for me be like:
I guess "Live Soft" is about a man with ED
Those positions thooo- I like how he just straight up walks out on him 😂😂😂
physics is not possible to do that
incredible bulk: finding alphorn mouthpiece
Ngl "Weirdo Kids" got me

“You got fortnite?” ‘We got fortday.’ “Minecraft” ‘Place-reassemble.’ “WHAT IS PLACEREASSEMBLE? forget it, do you have roblox?l ‘No, but we have a better thing, fly blox.’ “Mario?” ‘Mercurio.’ “DO YOU EVEN HAVE SUBWAY SURFERS?” ‘Nope, we have train riders.’
I will send you to Jesus
Jesus is seeking you your not the one that is seeking him
Pps dont use Jesus, name in vain
Accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent you shall be saved give it a try I mean accepting Jesus is a great thing cause if you do your safe from hell you might think hell isn't real but it is and heaven isn't boring ppl think heaven is boring but in fact, you can fly in heaven accept Jesus as your Lord and savior repent and always remember God does Love you...
He should have said slow and frustrated

Not every day you see a man irritated to the point of planking...

"I will send you to JEE-sus!"  Well that must be the plot of Finding Jesus.
Fun fact: The Incredible Bulk actually existed
I have got to get me a copy of "Finding Jesus 2" that thing looked hot
The fact that incredible Bulk is real is what killed me 😂🥴
I think home alone should of been out together
this is one of his best vids yet, you never fail to make my day Steven.
I’ve seen the bulk... what’s a seven letter word that describes the opposite of success?
I love that you're starting to incorporate real off brand products into these sketches; it gives the ones you made up a greater feeling of authenticity.
man's poses crack me up *Crouch* DOUBLE DECKER BUS?!
KSI as Incredible Bulk. I'd pay to see that.
Ayyyy #31 on trending after 3 days
I like how included (the first 3) real movies, those are real and you can buy it   Edit: 4 actually, incredible bulk is a real movie, a horrible green screen movie, but is a movie
Final Fantasy? We have Initial Reality!!
Made me enjoy an add

Missed opportunity to call Squid Game Octopus Tomfoolery
"Do you have mission impossible?" "We have 'mission probably not'" "Don't tell me its Tom Cruise" "It's with Tom DoubleDecker bus" " *DOUBLE DECKER BUS* "

Lol
A little bit of a miss opportunity for calling vin Diesel Thin Gas
id rather buy some bejing kong.
Didn't I Hate Everything review The Incredible Bulk as part of The Search for the Worst?
He is so funny he always makes my day
1:20
No joke,I though "Awkwafina" was just a misspelled indication of the water bottle brand product placement. I didn't realize it was an actual person until Raya and the Last Dragon.
"But we need it for the plot" lol gold
The moment he says incredible bulk I would’ve have left and returned with a machine gun
Whoe ever made those thumbnails for the movies is a god
How do i get better than the neighbors kid
Another nice video from my favorite youtuber, Steven She
I literally love this video: pure comedy! The Jumanji-esk jungle drums really hyped everything up. Great job Steven!

1:44, fun fact: This is actually a movie. Look it up.
Lets do not talk about the shotgun in the background :D
steven he i luv u
"it's not a mistake ✨ it's a masterpiece ✨"
Bone alone sounds like a sad p*** video
When did planking come back
Me when I lag in a game : 1:04
- [ ] Time to get right with Jesus. nobody is automatically gonna go to heaven at the end of it, we all have lied or stolen or had sex before marriage and the punishment is hell. Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of future sins if you repent of them once you commit them, so you receive the gift of forgiveness by following him. When you start you have to stop sinning, and follow his word and obey it. That’s following Jesus. Read your Bible!!!
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
"Ksi The incredible bulk" 😂😂😂 Someone should post this on his reddit lmao
lol
We got fast and frustrated 😂😂😂
1:50 incredible bulk, --- KSI AhahahahahLesgoo
Transformers into deformers
Steven dad “Do you have the naruto”  “We got black clover “
Do you think he knows that the incredible bulk is a real movie?  I can't tell.
U make videos just like bhuvan bam aka bb ki vines, tht guy has 30 mil subs on yt and u also deserve the same number of subs
I need a t-shirt w/ "I will send you to Jesus " with a hand holding a slipper. ❤🧡💛❤️‍🔥 you rock, Stephen 🤘
Mans violated ksi
Anyone ever say to you, your Character accent sounds quite similar to "Uncle Rodger". Is that a typical accent style from a region?
Vin Diesel explaining the importance of family
Japanese sponser.  -150000 social credit
how they dont even notice they have the same pavement its a 1 in a million chance
I'd watch Bone Alone with that dog lol.
fyi for those who don't know; the Bulk movie is actually a real thing! :) it's called "The Amazing Bulk" and it absolutely looks like a school project. here's the link to the trailer: https://youtu.be/ywaR-Lq_ayk
Top 10 Best 𝐻ƎNTA𝐼 Anime Series #2 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9lP8CJfqGw&ab_channel=Kurowolf
"do you have Aquafina? We have Fiji water."   excuse me?
I love that Christopher Nolan’s brother is Christopher Yeslan, yeah same first name.
Fast and frustrated, missn probably not & thin diesel got me rolling
lets be honest "THAT" looks super creepy
Finding Jesus 2
Omg we will send him to jesus
The " i will send you to Jesus " never gets old 😂😂😂😂

Fun facts: the incridible bulk is actually movie in 2012
Mine childhood  favourite movie is also finding Nemo when I saw finding Jesus 2 I laugh out loud
replace squid game with crab game lmao
£40 for snacks... I wish I was that loaded rn 40 is like 400 😭
I CANNOT be the only one who thought of KSI before he said the incredible bulk
我有的好奇你看得懂华文吗 if no: . . . . . . I will send you to jesus and  love your video
You know uncle Roger watches Steven he's dad, EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
1:19 yourwelcome XDDDD 1:32
Finding Nemo = (In off brand speak) FINDING JESUS. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME DO YOU WANT MY ENTIRE SANITY BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING FOR SALE
The incredible bulk!
KSI has bulked so much even the asians know of his adventure
the incredible bulk... 😂 😂
The katakana on the box “Zatto” 😂 on point👌🏻
it has got ksi hahaha nice one
You should have said SLOW and frustrated
For those curious: Finding Jesus 2 is an actual movie as is the other one Finding Jesus. And as you may have guessed its a shameless rip off of Finding Nemo but with an evangelical twist and quite a few offensive stereotypes thrown in. Saberspark did a video on both of them here on YT. If you need a laugh, check it out.
This channel is not as good as the Steven Her channel.
Jesus is an official character of his videos now :D
The incredible bulk… KSI. I am dead 😂
Incredible Bulk starring KSI. Seems legit🤣🤣
I don't know why but the planking montage at 1:03 had me rolling laughing.
Van diesel should be petrol moped
Where to buy?
Thin diesel doesn't say family he says adopted
OOF
Unless this guy has uncle roger affiliation this is shameful .  Maybe even criminal
This guy is the carlos mencia of asian comedians . What the fuck man. Youre out right doing an uncle roger video. This is more then joke theft . If you look up stealing intellectual property theres a picture of this guy shooting a you tube video on uncle rogers lawn. Whats next aunty jokes .  Oh wait ....................
I can't for part 4
Bro 1:51 sent me when he said its got ksi featuring in the incredible bulk 🤣🤣🤣
Steven raising his voice to say something just obliterate my ability to not laugh

I want to watch Bone Alone and Live Soft
The incredible bulk ksi lmao 🤣
I SWEAR U HAD 600K the other DAY??? 😭 u grew so fast vhbo
When everything is made in China:
LOL
"We have Bone Alone" "Atleast it's child friendly"  *I was laughing like a maniac on the floor*
EMOTINALOS DMAGERAS
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Steven he has a Henry rifle O_O.

Bruh the video is great but I have only one opinion about it. The place is different like get back to the original place in which everything was off-branded and funny not like this video(no offense) I like it but plz next time you do it at least get back to the original place.  Thanks and have a happy day
The incredible bulk lmfao
I got stuck in the T-pose after this.
I LOVE DOING AN IMPRESSION OF STEVEN HE BRO!!😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fast & Frustrasted 1...
Why finding jesus sus mooo
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
I like how the incredible bulk is an actual movie
Yoo The incredible Bulk, a Hypixel Smash Heroes character finally gets its own movie!?

someone get this to jj
Man y'all got The Incredible Bulk?!  I'll take all your copies
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Make a real Beijing corn company
Emotional damage
“He lost some weight for this one.” Dying over here… 😂

You are genuinely the funniest youtube comedian I've ever seen
When you see how offensive _"Finding Jesus"_ is: *EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!*
Probably not double take a bus 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Am I the only one who likes how Steven's father says "Ha-llo"
Steven: You have Warhammer 40k?  Majorkill: I have Battlemace 40 million. Try the Space Elf Deathlord or the Shark Daddy.
Emotional damage
The incredible bulk and ksi😂😂😂😂 this guy got bants😂😂
Steven got on a Rolex, is good for wrist
The funniest brand off for my opinion is finding Jesus 2, double decker bus, and the most funniest the bulk
In your accent, why do you have a gun on your door

Hahaha wasn't expecting KSI at the end there
KILL ME *Alive you*
The most genius way to not get copyrighted
@Steven He Any ideas for spins on training card games?!
Tom Doubledeckerbus lolol
BONE ALONE. ugh, fine. *unzips pants*
“Live Soft:” the sequel to Die Hard where John McClane retires to a quiet life in a cottage by the sea. He makes flower crowns and learns self love.
The incredible bulk is an actual film. He purple tho
Best video ever

I'm still stuck off of that "emotional damage "
It's the classic line for me " i will send you to  JESUS 🤣🤣🤣
Emotional damage 😂✨✌🏻
If you didn’t know, “the incredible bulk” is a real movie, it is absolutely awful and you need to watch it
"Join faith-fueled friends, Muggles and Joy, as they visit the beautiful Finding Jesus Bay, a place where Christian stories are told night and day. Guided by the sea's best storyteller, Professor Shark, they hear all about the endless kindness and boundless love of their Creator. Then, together - along with children everywhere - they go forth to spread His word, and make their world a better place. Finding Jesus will help kids learn about the Bible in a whole new and fascinating way.  Then, after a long missionary career they find themselves disturbed by the poverty and sin of the world. They then turn to drugs as they struggle to answer the deep, existential questions their faith cannot answer. As their addiction consumes them they realise the folly of blind faith and on their deathbeds after a decade long drug bender they realise there will be no pearly gates awaiting them when they die.  After failing to revitalize their souls after Jesus makes his escape, heinous Navy commanders, Muggles and Joy are back to track him down. They slowly realize, with deadly consequences, that they must recall their past lives to put an end to Jesus reign of terror once and for all."
If you call Beijing Corn off brand you get the slipper
Weird kids💀😂

Steven is going to single-handedly bring back planking
Feel like it was kind of a missed opportunity on the “Away Together” and “Losing Omen”. Anyway, I LOVE these
The incredible bulk is a tragedy of a movie
I remember 1 year ago u had 750 k - 850 k that’s what I remember and now u have 3 million subs keep it up
I can't listen to these at work, I'm dying lol 😂 😆

" Moon Battle " xD😂
What's with the Band-Aid
Double Decker bus twice the amount of lives that need to be saved be saved but also at the time it makes an easy solution because double Decker busses mostly Can be found in England where there are a lot of roundabouts or a famous one so so that will get you going for quite a while without getting anyone really in trouble you're in trouble by that I mean property damage then You know just clear the traffic around that area for The roundabout still probably about fuel but you know that's one thing solved It's also motion sickness but that was a problem before now just more Yeah That's pretty much it
The incredible Bulk Featuring JJ Olatunji aka ksi lol

This is me wondering how to paraphrase the word "i" and "the" when the teacher says to paraphrase everything
Finding Jesus, is that a bit like Where's Wally but with Our Lord and under the sea?  No wonder they made a sequel, that sounds fun.

Pretty sure a pervy friend of mine has an actual adult video (or adult video game (not sure which)) called “The Incredible Bulk” only think I know that cuz he’s really open about that kind of stuff and might have brought it up while we were sharing our favorite rip off stuff that made us laugh, but that was years ago so I’m only like 70% sure I remember that conversation correctly
You copy voice of Uncle Roger
Jesus waiting for 69 people now
Finally new video

The thing on the movie “That” is way more scary than it
Incredible bulk, starring mark rustle-o.
Christopher yeslin was brilliant.
'Bone alone'.... uh oh

Finding Jesus 2 and fast and frustration hits me hard🤣
"Finding Jesus 2" Me: Wait isn't Jesus supposed to walk on water why is he in the water
" It's with Tom double decker bus"  🤣 😂
Finding Jesus 2🤣
The part with Cristopher Yeslan got me wheezing
Imagine not stanning Steven. Yeah, no way Elizabeth.
Ksi after watchinng this : EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I'm from Asian
Anybody realise the lever action rifle hung up on the wall when he was mentioning the sponsor
Plankin huh?
I just watched 2 of your vids before this. All of them were sponsored by Bokksu.
By the time it got to "double decker bus" he was feeling murderous. 🤣
Mission probably not 😂
I wish instead of thin diesel he said thin petroleum
You know, metal man and the incredible bulk are real movies
Finding jesus tho 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Offbrand feels different if you're a Lost Pause fans.
Funny as Hell !🤣🤣🤣

Fatneeks assemble!!!
KSI 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I wait for the day when Steven will be no 1 YouTuber and Stevens dad will be proud of Steven
PRO LEVEL
I literally smelled the chocolate through the screen
1:20 Ah the classic
"We could have streamed movies at home but we need this for the plot" fucking LOL
Nah bro why always KSI has to suffer😭
LMAO, Christofer Yesland, Tom Double-decker Bus
PART 4: Steven's Dad went to a video game shop  "Hello''  'Hi'  ''Umm.. I was looking for some Play Station games''  ''Oh yeah we do have some  right there.''  ''Oh thankyou ( stares the game , pauses and replies)  'It says  - 'Study Platform' . '  And my creativity gave up. Congrats for 3M Sir. Already waiting for part 4
where in the world did he find these actually? like, that Finding Jesus
Hi Steve he can u make a video every week
Steven never fails to entertain me everytime I see one of his videos, especially since the ' shoe' is a legendary weapon
Congrants on 3 mil subs :))
Movie: Finding Jesus 2 Steven's dad: I will send you to Jesus
Lol finding jesus
KSI🤣🤣🤣🤣.... Bruuuh. Wait till jj sees thiw 😂😂😂
E
The planking all over got me dead🤣
Just in time before 1M views! 😁
Like or Steven will send you to Jesus
I'm frickin' dying! These skits are great
"People love the incredible bulk!!! Its got... KSI"
Who knew him before emotional damage
Star wars can be planet peace
I thought he would say "I will sent you to Jesus" because there was finding Jesus 2
You got 12 Angry Men? We have 6 Happy Women.
I am just crying while watching the video. This sooooo funny 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What happened to your head?
emotional damage 大哥
Man I love Steven She’s videos
I'd love to see finding jesus2
“Its got KSI” bro thats elite, only a few will get it 😂
Emotional Damage became a meme
I will send u too Jesus
So many he could do so little Time he  ends to team up with the screen rant guy and do a movie pitch 🤣🤣
Ksi be bulking thooo
you missed a perfect opportunity with home alone. Bone Together
Hope his eyebrow heals, if he wasnt an actor this wouldnt of happened
Am I crazy or did this guy only have 2 million subs like a couple days ago  No way he went up to 3 in a couple days right?
mission probably not xDDDD
my man litreally glitched into the bed after listening to this
This is the best one you've done so far!!! <3
its sad that finding jesus is real
I love how Steven is on the KSI bulk lore
FInally another video
1:48 AHAHAHHAHAH MY MAN DID JJ DIRTY THERE
Finding Jesus XD  Steven is constantly getting threatened to find him
steven you are a meme
The Emperor Zhaolie of Han finds this pleasing.
Worth the wait !!!! Double decker bus 😂😂😂😂😂
He didnt just say....the incredible bulk did he? I saw IHE video on it about 1 or 2 years back .... and ooooh my god
E
"people absolutely love the incredible bulk , it got............ksi" im dead 💀💀😂
DOUBLE DECKER BUS
'Tom doubledeckerbus' I was rolling on the floor at that moment
How did he even.....1:02
Bro no cap if bone alone was a real movie I would spend all my money to buy it
Instead of thin diesel it should have been thin petrol
Werido kids is fairy spot on
incredible bulk lmao
I need a "I'll send you to Jesus" t-shirt!!
Mission probably not🤣🤣🤣🤣
it’s got… ksi 😂😂😂
I legit thought he was going to keep Tom Cruise as Tom Cruise.
My man is too underrated he deserves way more subs he always makes me laugh 😂
Man the combination of him lying in all those positions and then “We got mission probably not.”  Just killed me
1:40 change incredible to amazing and you've got an actual movie that was actually made
didn't expect KSI, Well it's not a lie tho lmao!
Man got so angry he started planking xD
I love the ad segments because it's funny to compare. I find it hilarious just how much he exaggerates his stereotypical-asian accent for the skits vs what his barely accented normal voice sounds like.
Thin engine Like thomas and friends Diesel and engines So thin engine
thin diesel i was dying
Lol
I wonder how many people actually understood the KSI joke 😂😂😂😂
How..how do you come up with these? Like all the "Off Brand" skits are amazing
"I will send you to Jesus"  They're still trying to find him
Incredible BULK had me floored
“Yeah he lost weight for this one. That’s Thin Diesel!” *Proceeds to lie down and look for who asked^
Hi Steven she
What happened to your head dude? I've recently subscribed, but I've seen you with a bandaid on a couple of videos. :O

LMAO FINDING JESUS 2
You ever been so frustrated you just plank
stevenhe10
Fast and the furious to fast and the frustrated, why not slow?
This world record goes to... "Steven He" for "EMoTIoNAl DaMAgE"
This “series” is my absolute favourite on this channel ❤️
This guys got emotional damage
If it says 'IMA SEND U TO JESUS!!' You know it's gonna be good!
It would have been funnier if when steven says i will send you to jesus he would have said plzz do we need to find him as
heyyyy dont hate on Incredible Bulk, its a good movie :<
I...i just cant see the gun
bone alone is a real thing and it scares me
Snax
I lost it at his stiff man reaction
i laughed so hard when he said tom double decker bus
I'm already laughing when the video start🤣🤣🤣
Steven will not reply to this comment
Omg finally
1:21, but he already found Jesus. It's right beside you :^)
I hate these sponsors because it reminds me that I can’t get them and that they look so nice
Me everytime I go to a store and saw their store brand names 🤣
Ya got Vin Diesel? Yeah we got Loose Petrol
"incredible Bulk" this name is the world's perfection
We need reddit videos back
the fact that these off brand movies ACTUALLY EXIST and are sold in stores where i live, always good for a laugh
Just noticed the band-aid, you had it since many videos     Hope you heal soon! you are one of my favorite comedians on YT!
its got............KSI
Asian go to other country like USA: Asian buying a sevener to bring home: Asian realizing that the sevener they buy is from their country:
The fact some of these are probably actual Chinese knock-offs makes it more hilarious.
it keeps getting better each video
I legit watched every video in this channel now  Achievement Unlocked
If you guys don’t know, Al Pacino is the actor of Scarface
He got the optimistic brother of Christopher Nolan - Christopher "Yes"lan   🤣🤣Im still laughing since 6 hours
bulk is an actually movie with terable grafics
Finding Jesus!!!!! Looks like Jesus is off brand......I should worship nemo thank you I'm diving rn
I don't know why, but this video really sums up my actual humor and attitude lmao especially at 1:27 (Christopher Yeslan got me on that one) because I tend to joke around and would actually say that kind of stuffs always in oppposite/reversed way with my friends.
You have got "mission impossible"?  We have "Mission probably not".
WHEN HE STARTED PLANKING I LOST IT
He said fast and frustrated🤣🤣🤣
Same case :3
Thank you, I now have the title for my autobiography: Mission Probably Not
He is now contractually required to "Send him to Jesus"
I now want to see bone alone It sounds awsome
"Finding Jesus 2" - the perfect show for people of any religion to accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior
Can't wait for 'Weirdo Kids' Season 4!
Can someone put the bulk scene in ksi's reddit
'Finding Jesus 2' Where is 'Finding Jesus 1'? I need answers. Also, congrats on 3 mil subs, IMO, you deserve more.
I will send you to Jesus is what Steven He’s dad is saying constantly and is questioning all life choices…. Steven you should make a video called “If Failure Management was a Person”
People absolutely love the incredible book it got…. KSI😂
Pls reply something to this comment, Steven! I am a BIG FAN of you... PLS!

In these videos he's not Steven He   He's Bob Her
congo you gave new names for marvel heroes. how  does your brain works this good

Mr chinese copy our world:(
0:50 Should have been "Slow And The Frustrated" If you really wanted to go off brand lol.
POV: You Enter In A Parallel Universe Where Knock-Off Are The Main Things and not the real ones
Getting sponsored by Food brands is a dream come true.
YAYYYYYYY OMG STEVEN MY FAVOURITE SERIES IS BACK THANK YOU

In finding Jesus, Steven actually does get sent to Jesus

Moon Battle and mission probably not hahahaha
I remember Steven at 200k subs, it felt like I had him all to myself, now I have to share with so many more people
Home failure 3
feels kinda too formulated ...
The "I will send you to jesus" should've been: I will send you to neeeemoooo
1:20 and 1:31 had me laughing so hard  Steven successfully sent me to Jesus  Stevens dad: congratuations you are no longer failure
Bruh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jesus so hard to find, they had to make a sequel
Finding Jesus is just pure comedy

"The Incredible Bulk"... Well, there does exist a movie called "The Amazing Bulk"... And yes, it is a rip-off of The Incredible Hulk...

Try watching this at 1am and not waking up your parent with laughtet
Steven should make video with camera operator
fiji water is fire though

"fast and frustrated" - describes my last girlfriend.
That incredible bulk thing is actually real
We need to see him collab with uncle roger
1:51 savage
1:33 how
Yep KSI would make bulk really incredible.
Actually The Incredible Bulk is a real movie but isn’t the Marvel one. However, there is a character in Marvel named Bulk.
Bone Alone lol. Kid friendly 😂
I know you said makers but i heard n-word
Khristafa yeslan
Your truly a gift for youtube, please never leave us! i have quoted you "Specializing in Failure management" in my bio now, thanks!

I feel proud when I saw I have the same tablet cover as Steven..... lmfaoo 😭💀
Why does that dog look excited while two guys are standing behind him?
Oof. Missed opportunity by not saying "I will send you to Jesus." After showing Finding Jesus 2.
The way when he said "double decker bus" makes my day better
He violated ksi 😭
the fact that I'm pretty sure all of these are real and that I've seen the incredible bulk is amazing
That plank will forever make me laugh
>The Incredible Bulk >It got KSI  That's just the perfect finale punchline
This my favourite series funny stuff! You got YouTube? We have Mepipe!
You still hurt?
Double decker bus! 🤣🤣🤣
"I will send you to Jesus"   "You mean Jeskeptical?"
Eris morn hears moon battle  *crota based ptsd intensifies*
Finding Jesus 2 doesn’t hold a candle to the original
You got Steven He? We got Steven She  You got Uncle Roger? We got Auntie Helen  You got Mr Beast? We got ms monster  You got Dream? We got Reality
his planking skills are on peak
This has to be in KSI's next Try not to laugh video..😂

Amazing bulk and metal man are real movies lol

Sick ideas🔥🔥🔥🔥
Steven: If your from asia like me its gonna feel nostalgic Me from mongolia and has never eaten anything like it: reality is often disappointing
Steven always never fail to entertain us 🤣
.
Web Boy... So he's 9 and his business is selling webs? Interesting 😂😂
The "I will send you to Jesus" line had lost its comedy after kids spamming it left in right.. very sad times..
Noice
When you said Tom Double-Decker Bus my soul left my body.
Bone alone  Who gave you the rights to make a movie about my sexual life?
The Incredible Bulk premieres in Idk I did not look at the calendar

No one talking about how he got hurt in his head and still doing the video for our entertainment.   Truly Sigma 😃😎
Bro The Incredible Bulk is a porno from the early 90s....
I will visit the Steven He video store always.
Incredible bulk sounds like a....nevermind 🤣🤣
Someone please put this on jj's reddit😅🙏
00:58 for a second i thought he was gonna say thin petrol
Waiting for that day customer says “I’ll send you to Jesus” and the shopkeeper replies we have satan

You want Steven Kings It? We have Stephanie Queens They/Them
This is beautiful :,)                                 CHRISTOPHER YESLIN                                                       DOUBLE DECKER BUS
You can easily find jesus if you cause enough emotional damage to steven's dad
The next time do a off brand of Steven he something like Steven we or Steven that
U should have done “U got Alice in border land?” “We got Alex in the wall” Update: u got encanto? We got unenchanted
My brother sent me a pic of a turtle costume that had 'Pubescent Frog of Silent War' on the package and now I think I know where he got it...Steven! 🧐
My favorite movie is the incredible Bulk with KSI 😂😂😂
You should have done Vin Unleaded 😂 love these off brand videos!
2:27  THAT  THAT FACE  THAT FUCKING FACE  THAT FACE GOT ME SOO HARD I AM NOW ROLLING
how is "I will send you to Jesus" still not a meme-
Netflix be like
Where is this convenience/video store?  These titles sound like something I should check out.  P.S.  Congrats on your father's cameo on the latest Uncle Roger!
When is "bone alone" gonna come out?
The fact that some of them are actually real movies
This made my day xD
I will send you to Jesus!😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣
The planking got me
Steven can you be my spirit animal for now on?
Yo someone put this on r/Ksi just for the last line
I Will Send You To Jesus Could Never Get Old💀😂

Uncle Roger featured you in a video and it literally made me mad. Go fight him
Off Brand Collectibles? Off Brand Video Games? Just a few ideas! Love the videos as always Steven! It's always great to come home from work and laugh! :')
shoudla been slow and frustrated🤣
Asians with cowboy rifles mounted to their walls make me happy. Lol noodle westerns. The good, the bad, and the umami. Soupstone. Once upon a time in the east. Shanghai noon. Red bean river. My darling mandarin. Butch csssidy and the kungpao kid. (⌐■_■)–︻╦╤─  one eyed jackie chan.... ok ok ill see myself out
Why am I alone?
m8 the best one is the Christopher Nolan one man, I died omg XDDDDD
The one with The Rock? -Ah, The Sock... LMFAO I died there
1:03 how steven he's dad sleeping at 3am
the incredible BULK
steven's dad: it says that me: no im pretty sure it says they :^)
Sponsor product looks similar to South Korea's kloot boxes.  Great idea for cultural exchanges and, somewhat, travel experiences.  Hopefully this catches on in every country.
THAT??? WHAT IS IT?
Every single time "I will send you to Jesus" shows up in one of your vids, I lose my shit. XD
how to make an asian angry? one of the famous moves you have to enraged an asian is to be their neighbor there for you can shout anything you want and make some emotional damage,the next  thing you can do is just to failed at  something it doent matter if it is to insignificant or very important with that you can do an extra emotional damage,very efective and then you can be in a job  where everything is off brand and invent other thing that don't exist but they sound off brandto do an extra emotional damage very efective
Did you get Bulk from Hypixel Smash Heroes
I love how Steven is turning into a meme
His reaction are op
vin petrol
WE NEED THE STEPHENY SHE MEME IN ONE OF THESE VIDEOS
Ofc I'm late :(
Yes
Those planks killed me 🤣🤣🤣
He said he wants to collab with Nathan Doan but he does not have enough followers to send him a message well now he has 1 million more subscribers than him
"Dou-ble de-cker bus!"
I love this  I can't stop laughing 😂😂😂😂😂
Steven, what happen to you? Were you standing on your toilet in order to hang a clock in your bathroom, slipped and hit the sink? Who won the next 30 years worth of sports?
EYYO You did @KSI dirty man🤣🤣🤣 "incredible bulk" lmao
Funniest one yet
WE NEED NEW IDEAS
10% off? Buying 5
Not gonna lie this is getting kinda old, In all of them it’s just  “Do you have (Insert famous thing)?  “ yes we have (Insert famous thing with slightly different name)  Repeat
"Its got KSI" 🤣🤣🤣 "Im BLUKING!!"
Wish u have a great day
now "I will send you to jesus" doesnt feel funny anymore, wrong placement in this video
This video is brought to you by container litigation.
"You got Fast and Furious?" "We got Fast and Frustrated" It's honestly the same thing 🤣
Do you have demon slayer No, we have angel protectors
Thin-petrol.
Finding Jesus got me 🤣🤣🤣
Ah the Amazing Bulk, a true masterpiece that even the directors wrote themselves in the box art "you can't enjoy this movie unless you're drunk."

Hello, welcome back to the cinemas  Cashier: what movie would you like to watch? Stevens Dad: ummmm... I'm down for some action comedy so do you have any seats for Johnny English? Cashier: Hahahahaha, what did you say? Do you mean Timmy Asian? Stevens Dad: What is that?  Cashier: It's like Johnny English but Asian style Stevens Dad: *wait that kid looks familiar* OMG, ITS DA NEW NEIGHBOURS KID WHO CAN BREAKDANCE AND SAY PIZZA IN RADIATION RADIUS BLAST MAKE VERY PERFECT PISSA.  Timmy's DAD who landed paperclip on da sun: oh hello Mr Beijing corn, look at my son. Little Timmy better actor than Steven he got big movie staring his grades. Stevens Dad: my son always failure, how come my punishment no work? Timmy's dad: because you too weak. Your punishment so bad that it no good at finesses through physic.  Stevens dad: you no see my video. I finesse it to hit steven while he's editing the footage of me finesse my slipper. This I push him to do better while in the past. Timmy's dad: that's nothing. Instead of telling Timmy that I'll send him to Jesus's, I ACTUALLY DID I give him so much emotional damage it shatter his heart then go to heaven but come back realising what happen when you get an A and not an A plus. Stevens dad: I should try that Timmy's dad: you should. Very effective

Steven He’s That, truly a masterpiece.
I'd love the "I'd send you to Jesus" actually send him to the Jesus you're finding at 0:44
The incredible bulk sounds very promising
If I walked into a place like that and they constantly read me off brand versions of what I want I would fire bomb the place
Vin Diesel’s off brand is Vin Gasoline
"Bokksu sponsored you, right?" "Oh yes, Kureetö sponsored this video indeed" - this guy, probably.
Christopher Yeslan JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
1:00 The random planking killed me...
Thin diesel who does he fight carbs
Its funnier when you realise The Incredible Bulk and Metal man movie really exists

"Okay, so you got Ice-cream, right?" "Oh, that? Of course, we do! We changed the name though. It's now called Water-condense now." " *WAAAAtErrrrr COnDeeeeenSeEe?!, i WiLL brIng yOu to JeSUS* "
Ngl vin deisel ripoff should have been thin gasoline
I watched this video like 5 times today ong its funny
How do you make such good content,like the color red can do better for me FOR GODS SAKE!!!!!!!!!!
The man was so angry he started planking..
Finding Jesus 😂 I’ve heard about that. It’s real and it has a trailer. It looks so funny. I’m a Christian, but this movie is just…. Idk even what ti say about it
Should have said Lost Petrol instead of Thin Diesel
Really entertains!  I laughed so hard in the "we got fast and frustrated " LMFAOO
We must make a I will send u to Jesus compalation
I’m glad you are having fun doing these they are very funny
Knockoff of Vin Diesel should've been Thin Gasoline. Change my mind

Hey Steven you are Awesome bro 😎
Imagine that after he leaves the store Stevens dad comes in and says “ failure” and then just leaves
Pretty sure incredible bulk is an actual CGI animation rip off movie that is actually real check it out If I'm not mistaken the main character is a big purple guy
I was expecting him to say Fat and the Fustrated but ok.
Today I had a bad day but you brightened it. Thanks Steven
1:05 Lying flat
You should've said Vin Gasoline cause its the opposite of diesel
Every time I look at him, I think of ( Shang Chi )
WEIRDO KIDDDS!!!
Welcome to Blockblister

Lost opportunity Vin diesel Vin gasoline
Seeing him planking out his frustrations had me laughing so hard I got a side stitch and to pause the video. 😭
finding Jesus，Oh my god，best one by far🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Steven your channel is growing so fast! Please dont change like other youtubers who change stuff over time as they get famous, i like your content just the way it is, short, simple but ULTRA FUNNY. Double Decker Bus! xD
bokksu basically owns steven
You guy got squid game? No i we got oqtopus work 😁
I would like to say I subscribed before 50 k subscribers
He said ksi is a off brand🤣
Man instead of vin diesel it should have been thin gas
This channel grew so fast   Last day I say it was 1.7M
"Finding Jesus" 🤣😂😂🤣💜
I preferred the opposite game from the previous ones, such as home alone could be work crowded XD
The postures though🤣🤣
" I will send you to JeSuS" is the best phrase, never gets old. Literally dying!
this just made my day its very good hope you stay safe
I will send u to Jesus is funny 😂😂😂😂 I love the vids
Stranger things Weirdo kids ✔✔
I guess yeslan ends movies with a good concise ending unlike nolan
PLANKING!! Steve dad PLANKING.  thank you.
The finding Jesus part made me laugh
Happy republic day to all Indians here  And beautiful video as always
The incredible bulk is an interesting movie to say the least. Diamondbolt did a good recap on it
I somehow managed to pause at the best time at 1:56 where it just looks like Steven's internalizing "Shamefur dispray"
DoUbLE dECkEr BuS!!!!
Thin diesel follewed by the planking had me dying
393,094 views, 47k likes, 3k comments, 3.07M subscribers. Nice!!

Respect to my man who had to do Supermans on nearly everything in the room.
CHRISTOPHER YESLAND AHAHHAHAHAHA
Finding Jesus 2 😂😂😂 I will send you to Jesus
This dudes reactions and movements are giving me a bakemonogatari vibe
Love the content Steven, can you make another when Asian is a difficulty video please
You know the first time I heard of the movie “The Incredible Bulk” I thought it was a porno
“I’ll send u to Jesus !” Holds slipper in hand.
I have been waiting for this for so long I love this series
I like it how i see a winchester in the back screen when you're eatin bokksu
THE SAD THING IS THE INCREDIBLE BULK IS A REAL MOVIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEE
we need an episode where he says the off brands rather than the original
Bulking ksi 😂
You are very Funny & Original. Continued Success! Thank You for the Laughs
Omg Christopher Yeslan 😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Double decker bus hilarious  Love ur videos bro make more quickly pliz. Can't wait 4 the next one
Oh the planking and becoming one with the plank. I had to rewind to watch that again. 🤣
Yayaayaysysy
DOUBLE DECKER BUS ?!!!!! 😭😭 dies from frustration*
Best part is the video started at 144p for me for some reason
XD
Finding jesus OMG XD
The incredible bug had me laughing unbelievably 😂😂
I love that I’m born in the same time as this legend
I hate that most of these actually exist (the incredible Bulk, finding jesus ext)
Finding Jesus:"friends, family and faith under the sea"
“I will send you to Jesus” 😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂😂😂
I don't think there is any channel to get content as good as this no 🧢
Steven, you had that bandage on your head for a month. Are you ok, bro? Also, you should have a keychain that makes asian dad quotes. "Emotional damage" and "I will send you to Jesus!" would be amazing to sound off during conversation.
Loving the planks
pov: you’re here before 500k views. here, claim this ticket
Nolan is yeslan? Shouldn't it be yeswifi?
“Bone Alone” atleast its kid friendly
finding jesus: starring nero
can we get more  E M O T I O N A L  D A M A G E
"Don't tell me it's with Tom Cruise." "Its with Tom Double Decker Bus." "I will send you to Jesus." Nope. Still funny.
It’s the planking for me! Bring it back!😂
Dad just wanted to flex his not-invented-yet planking skills.
Congrats on 3 million subscribers Steven
The incredible bulk is an actual movie btw
i have seen bone alone
I'd watch bone alone
We got “Mission Probably-Not” That’s what my mother told me when I said I wanted to be an actor…
Suggestion: When Asians go golfing
"surley you have steven he" "you mean Steven She?"  What the hail????
1:05 Why did this make me laugh so fast-
Marvel forever
This is true art.
Mission Probably Not😂😂😂😂😂
Wow I. Early
The funny thing is that there is a movie called the amazing bulk
I would like to see "finding Jesus"🤣🤣🤣🤣
You should’ve totally putted bonk Choy on there instead of bok choy
hehehe:D
1:04 Excellent form steven
Wait I recognise some of those of brands does that mean that some of the off brands have been real in the previous ones? Oh no
'Double decker bus' was the best part
I like this a lot!
Maybe at China they have this titles lol Fiji water lol so funny the incredible bolck
The part in 1:04 literally made me ascend to heaven.
You just complete this day. lmao :D
Remind me when I was little buying from the vendors on McDonald avenue off brand and bootleg movies from the back of a van. "Hey papi I'll give you a good price 3 DVDs on one VHS for $4 man what do you say."
Ey man you’re video’s are hilarious keep going make these stupid vids, I love it💪
I'm from ASEAN
“I will send you to Jesus” LOL
EmOTionAl DaMagE
Why no Vin Petrol and Slow & Frustrated?
Thunder rang throughout the streets of Brooklyn, New York, "Give us what we came for, Steven," a man demanded as he stood over a man laid out in a crater. Steven merely smirked from the demand, "Over my dead body," he retorted as anger grew into the man's face, "That could be done," the man stated, lunging towards Steven, closing his eyes to accept his fate.   But the finishing strike never came; opening his eyes once more, Steven saw a man standing over him, stopping the man's attack. "D-d-dad?" Steven questioned as the man looked down at him, "FAILURE," Steven's dad stated as he threw the attacker away.   Recollecting himself, the attacker glared at Steven's dad with dozens of men surrounding the two. "So you are the true protector of Beijing Corn, Steven's dad," the man stated as a bolt of lightning struck only yards away from him. "And you are the one who created Physics, Issac Newton," Steven's dad stated as Issac Newton clenched his fist.   "Steven, you must leave; this battle is not yours to fight; you are too much of a failure to defend the legendary Beijing Corn," Steven's dad stated as he summoned his weapons, summoning the legendary can of Beijing corn and a short-range tree branch, with various slippers floating around him.   Issac Newton picked one hand up, "ATTACK STUDENTS OF PHYSICS," he shouted as a dozen students rushed Steven's dad; the first rushed straight forward, throwing a strike straight for Steven's dad's face.   In the eyes of the father, time slowed, 'one in front with three circlings, I need to dodge first strike and counter by throwing him to the three surroundings,' he thought to himself as he caught the arm and judo threw him into the three circling behind him before sending a slipper to the direction of four more targets knocking them to the floor as he smirked.   "Too easy, eight down and only four more to go," he started as he reeled up his branch before swinging it at two approaching students; they fell to the floor as he merely laughed, "When I went to school, I had to fight two lions a day every day, now they do my taxes. Then I traveled up and downhill 20 miles on one foot at the same time. My other foot was starting a business," he explained beating the last of the students as he stood in front of Issac Newton.   "Then you created Physics," he angrily stated as he glared into the eyes of Newton, who merely placed his hands together. Steven's dad was sent flying as items began to float around Issac Newton, "Steven's dad, you merely have one of the legendary cans; I have the other four," he stated as the four cans were revealed.   First was Shanghai Corn, the can that was once protected by the neighbor, the second was Guangzhou corn protected by an unknown master, the third was the Hongkong Corn, and lastly, Doge corn.   "ALL I NEED IS BEIJING CORN, AND I WILL BE ABLE TO BANISH ALL A's," the man shouted as he aimed his palm towards Steven's dad, pushing the man to the ground before pulling him back.   Holding Steven's dad by the collar, Issac reached for the can but was stopped when Steven's dad placed both hands onto his temple, "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE," he shouted, causing both of their eyes and mouths to glow with white beaming lights.  When Issac opened his eyes, he stood next to Steven's dad in front of a car, "Steven, get me a screwdriver," he demanded; Issac had no control over his body as he found a box filled with different types of screwdrivers. "What is this," he thought to himself as he looked at the box before looking back at Steven's dad.   "Which one?"    "The one in the box,"  "Which one?"  "The one that turns the screw?"  "I know, but which one,"   "THE ONE WITH THE HANDLE," Steven's dad shouted as Issac felt frustrated from the response.  "T-they a-all have handles," he cried out as he fell to the floor in a futile position.   Outside of the mind, Steven's dad stood over the fallen Issac, breathing heavily, "That right there is emotional damage," he stated as he took the last four cans away from Issac.   "D-dad, you won," Steven celebrated before his dad glared at him. "STEVEN YOU'RE A FAILURE,"  THE END
I don’t know how many times I watched this but it is comedy gold! 😂😂
The incredible bulk is an actual movie. And it’s just as bad as it sounds
Please tell me he has i will send you to jesus in this vid

*proceeds to plank all across the room*
Have any merch that has “I will send you to jesus!” on it? XD Love that

*This is a Certified Hood Classic*
Its always a good day when Steven He uploads
“You got mission impossible?” “We got mission probably not”” This killed me😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
How this man is not on world tour right now disappoints me and my day is ruined.
Steven laughing at his own jokes is a true gift.

Finding Jesus is an actual movie people. There are some blatant ripoffs from Disney and Pixar content to pray on parents who dunno better so they can make cheap sales basically.
Thank you for the laughs, fam. 👍😁
LETS GOOO PART3
the videos is amazing        NO BODY CLICK THE BOT LINKS I repeat DO NOT CLICK THE LINK
I haven't seen a video this good in to long :)
I’ve got the same iPad cover as him
Those cuts of him in disbelief 💀 Planking got be bad lmaooo
'I will send you to Jesus!'  Always iconic for any reason.
Now we just need a knock off Steven dad
Holy shit Steven’s dad brought back planking and it was actually funny
This has peaked  Really though, I can't see it going much further without getting old if I'm being honest. Still, great job nonetheless!
Off-brand political groups;  The Republican party - the Liberal Party (if you don't get this joke, you're not well-versed in Aussie politics)   Off-brand activist groups 🤣
Oh my fucking God bruh I ws legit waiting for him to say KSI, going straight to his reddit
Love your content, btw I heard some streamers say some of your sayings and some of your sayings are all over tiktok.
LOL i love the #EmotionalDamage
Incredible Bulk ft. KSI bruh that got me 😂😂😂😂
The incredible bulk LMAO
I have a question I commented. (Steven He: You got iron man? Employee: We got metal guy.) on when everything is off brand 2. Is that were you got metal guy from?
0:55 literally perfect that he stated a freaking Prius lol
what happened to yo head?
Time to find "That" if it's even a thing
2 minutes of cracking up, true quality comedy.
How did KSI get into here lol
Am I allowed to say that this is next to Asian parent punishments when it comes to the best pieces of work
Honestly, The Incredible Bulk might be better than the original😂😂
We have bad child shoes
I love how the shopkeeper always gets terrified when anybody walks in and congrats on 3 million you are the best
"That" got me bursting laughter in my office😭🤣🤣
How many boxsu videos did he make
Tom double decker bus in the new mission Probably not is my favourite movie ever
Thin Diesel........LMAO😂😂
EMOTIONAL DAMMAGE
LMAOOOO, I died when he said, CHRISTOPHER YESLAND?????
“Finding Jesus 2 ”💀💀
I’m from Asia as well
The names of movies are so good, keep up this content man!
Steven's dad buying indie games:  1) coffee pot face (Cuphead) 2) abovefeather (Undertale) 3) Thursday Morning singing (Friday Night funkin') 4) Flimsy and the pigment machine (Bendy and the Ink Machine)
"I will send you to Jesus." Gets me everytime.
"Incredible Hulk is about....KSI" Bro our fatneek is finally in marvel.
POV: You are sent to Jesus 0:43
Ahem ahem… I think we all need some Finding Jesus 2
Jesus loves you
That? lol
Incredible bulk 😂
Steven, did you move?
Double decker bus… that reminds me of when Emmit from the Lego movie said double decker couch!!😂😂
i will send you to jesus never gets old
The legends back!
"you got Christopher Nolan?" "we got his optimistic brother Christopher yeslan" that one got me laughing so hard xD
Its so good
Congratulations on 3 Million subscribes Steven! I remember when you were only still at 100k! Keep it up mate. Wishing all the best for ya.
Steven always have a way to make thing off brand
The incredible bulk - KSI 🤣🤣🤣
When he says he is going to send him to Jesus, he meant the fish
As a Japanese kid (with experience of getting beat) my mom never used the sandal. She would use a Woden spoon. So can u do one with a Woden spoon.
Bok
Wth those snacks cost €60, financial damage
"I will send you to Jesus" is one of the greatest lines ever. I would start saying it but I don't have a slipper or that level of power behind it.
250k views in 7 hours… take that Steven’s dad.
"Yeah, he lost weight for this one. That's *THIN* Diesel."  *Steven He's Dad immediately starts planking out of nowhere*
wtfs going on with steven in  the comments lol
CHRISTOFER YESSIN???
Me when I’m on a phone call for over 2 minutes: 1:04
You have to watch finding Jesus before you send him there
Can I ask what's with the plaster? Are you alright.
What's with the planking?   Off-brand clothing brands (I'm Aussie, so you might not have heard of some of these)  Rip-Curl - cut-corners Mambo - tango  Billabong - swamp-pocket  Mad Dog - angry chihuahua  Bonds - loans JeansWest - slacks south Just Jeans - all pants matter (just making fun of ALMs. OMG, I'm laughing so hard at this pun)  Jay Jay's - be be
Bokkusu should grant him a life-time subscription. Just watching him eat those snacks makes me so happy.
Steven became Confused soo much he turned in to a plank, also the double decker bus got me so much I laughed so hard 😂🤣🤣😂😅🤣love you man  it's my 98 day of been a subscriber for your channel ♥️♥️🙏
Can’t believe they made a movie on Tony Mandarich in this universe 🤣
if oreo and hydrox was in these videos where the store is selling oreos and steven dad thinks they finally dont have the off brand when the store person says oreo is actually is the off brand item
I thought Tom Cruz was going to be Tom Manual, but Double Decker Bus beats it.
What the Hellllll
That fish on “Finding Jesus 2” looks sooo derpy 😆
Finding Jesus 2 . . . XD
noice
complation of just the reactions when? or shall i wait for the 2022 recap for it?
YES ITS PART 3 OF OFF BRAND
send you to jesus nah you will FIND jesus
y do you have a shotgun
Bruh incredible bulk is played by KSI... goddam
“Mission probably not” Actually sounds like an interesting film
"i will send you to jesus" "i already found it"
Never failed to entertaint me so much.... So claver
Bone alone...  at least it child friendly
Congrats on making on the Meme 🤣 "Emotional Damage!"
Love your vids
Pog
"It's got... KSI"  The ever so slight hesitation was what made it peak comedy.
I feel like I found a old YouTube vault from like 8 years ago. Bro this is great.
it's amazing how "Finding Jesus" is an actual movie
I have a good one if you need any for your videos.  You should say,”do you have Daniel LaRusso.”  He should reply with,”we have Ralph Machio.”  As the joke.
KSI why?
Fun fact: There actually is a knockoff Hulk called Bulk, but instead it’s called the Amazing Bulk. It is truly the greatest movie ever conceived by mankind.
Is there a finding jesus 1? I need to know the whole story on this one.
i would watch finding jesus
Your positioning is interesting 😂
“It’s got ksi”- Steven he
Great videos as always
So glad your channel is getting the recoginition it deserves, the world NEEDS to discover the face of Beijing Corn.
what is with the bandage?
Emotional Damage!
Someone Has Too get JJ to react to this!!!
Tom double decker bus!!!!!!!!!!!!
This channel was funny about the first five times I watched it and then I noticed something...   It's all the same coney old shrap shtick shrit.     AND NOW...  It's all the same coney old shrap shtick shrit with 33% Infomercials.  I only can guffaw at same old, worn out shtick so many times.   An now I crick UN suskribeee.     GOOD BYE HE!
"Mission: Propably Not" is a documentary about my life
you should do when when nobody notices you
This video is so off brand that jesus refused to let me load this video
YAYYYYYYY NEW VID im so excited 😁I love your content
What's up with the bandaid
You should do a "Steven He, but off-brand"  Ex: Emotional damage? No, Physical Therapy  So all your signature moves but "off-brand"
“Finding Jesus 2” “I will send you to Jesus”
I love how you say ‘I will send you to Jesus’ even though they have Finding Jesus 2, it would’ve been comedic if you used a dvd case and printed out Finding Jesus and used that for the threat. But the slipper is iconic and should be used
Now that you made Octopus Contest, make Depressed Arms (Happy Feet)
I will send you to jesus
Jesus is now a fish
Incredible bulk starting ksi
Haha hilarious pun intended when Tom Cruise becomes Tom Double Decker Bus 🤣🤣🤣
2:24 ARE THOSE BONGS ?
i'm watching this in the bus, trying hard not to laugh bc of "octopus contest" 🤣🤣
Bone alone LMAO
2:59 I like how Steven is literally laying on that piece of furniture like a fish and starts laughing weirdly
Sometimes I wonder how he manages to do some of this without laughing to death.
Wait there is a finding jesus 1?
1 minute add on a 3 minute video, noice.
I love when he gets sponsored by Bokksu, it's so fun to watch him freak out about the snacks.
He said KSI😭😭🤣💔
01:03 Everytime the emotional damage is kicking in
"You have bokksu?" "We have the box of Japanese."
1:03  1:21  1:31
I will send this video to trending
steven how did your channel grow so fast last time i checked you had 530K subscribers
bAHAHHAHAH EMOTIONNNAL DAHHHHMAGE!!! steven he meme activate
I thought the rip off of home alone would be home together
watching this at 5:16 am
"Do you have Spiderman No Way Home?" "We Have Arachnid-Kid: Yes Way Out"
Plz explain why steven he got a bandage on his head , did he got beaten by 1 elephant and 3 tiger
HA! Fiji water
You should make "emotional damage" reactions. People are taking your catchphrase and making it into a meme.
he definitely has emotional damage
The chancla is the strongest weapon that can bypass the law
When the clerk is expected to say: ‘I was held at gunpoint’ but its stevens dad: ‘held at Asian shoe point’
the amazing bulk is an actual movie and it's so hilariously bad. birdemic/10, completely recommend.
i died of laughter when they said “Tom Double Decker Bus”
THE BONE ALONE IS REAL THO 💀💀
masterpiece
Lol
I love how he puts up content than shows us the sponsor
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
It's all fun and games until "Toy Story" becomes "Figurine Fable".
The cut of random planking killed me🤣
The way he says “hello” is wholesome
Steven will always make me have a good day some how like these videos are amazing
“Mission Probably Not” is so dang brilliant 😂
Web-boy: Can't get home.
Lol
Finding Jesus
Steven, I'm so happy you got the recognition you deserve!!!! You definitely deserve it!
0:44 hasn't he used the same joke in every single one of these videos
1:08 I love how he specifically moved a table for this scene just to lay on it. Lmao
Steven he is so famous for his quote EMOTIONAL DAMAGE that uncle roger use it
LOL
Fast and frustrated lmao
That bandage proven that he has beaten 3 lions
could've gone with dunkacchino rather than macchiato smh
Why does he have a bandage on his forehead for like 4 videos in a row??
Hey there's a fire! Better call the Water Cowards!
0:44 wht the hell is that , emotional damage
Reminds me of Amanda, with "no this movie better much better".
I just have to point my slipper ar my daughter now and she knows exactly the phrase I'm saying in my head. _Emotional damage_ the household phrase used in 2022
When steven dad start living like american, i see gun hanged up there 🤣
Me as a non-native speaker pausing the vid every 3 seconds to get all the jokes 😂
Yeslin!
AYY HE USED THE OCTOPUS CONTEST JOKE!!!!
What will you think of next Steven 😂  "I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS" I'm surprised he didn't use the slipper lmao
The bandage on his head is from brain damage
Bro this series is OP
YOU HIT 3Mil!, Congrats BROOOO, LOVE UR CONTENT!!😎😎😎😁😁😁😁
“You guys have Spiderman?“ “We got Spider High Schooler, played by Tom Germany” “You got Iron Man?” “We got Tungsten Guy” “You got Black Panther?” “We got White Mountain Lion” “Doctor Strange?” “Nah but we got Nurse Odd”
I want to buy the finding Jesus 2 movie
0:44 Finding Jesus 2? That's easy. Have Steven He send you to Jesus and you'll find him pretty fast.
There really is an incredible bulk movie 🤣🤣
1:03 I seriously fell off my gaming chair LMAO
I miss you steven
Thin Diesel got me good.
e
It’s like 7:30 in the morning here lol
"its got ksi"

"Finding Jesus" 😭😂 And glad to see JJ made a second film... And this time about his prolonged bulking season
Finding jesus 2
He now just don't have time, he just walks away
🤣🤣🤣🤣These videos always have me rolling!!!!
Lets go another life saving video😂
Imagine getting so offended by something off-brand that it makes you start involuntarily planking in different spots around the room
missed opportunity to say Thin Gasoline steven why
1:19 i already know this is going to become a meme
1:04 mans did the plank challenge from the office
Cooked. 😭 I really needed that laugh aauuwwgh 😫 And I wasn't injured before this.
Steven's dad was so upset he reverted to 2009 and started planking
Hello bro great vids lmao
LOL THE WAY HE LAYS ON THE GROUND
Fiji water lmaooooo
😆
I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS always cracks me up 😂😂😂😂😂
Lol
this guy needs a show
2:03 AYO COUGHT IN 4K!?!?!?

At least ksi didn't turn into Micheal jackso...
Next up: restaurants  Dunkin Donuts? Dribblin Bagels Krispy Kreme? Soft Paste KFC? TBD...Tennessee Boiled Duck McDonald's? McDaisy's Burger King? Sandwich Queen SANDWICH QUEEN!?!?!?
Man brought out the PLANK
Iwl I laughed at the KSI
Bruh “I’ll send you to Jesus” is a famous and good quote keep it up
Quest Probably-not starring Jerry Doubledeckerbus
LOYAL FAILURE HERE BEFORE 1 million views 💯😇💯
I needed this it's my birthday and that made me feel better
1:03 When you get so frustrated you casually defy the laws of physics
Meanwhile those knockoff movie makers jotting down notes like:
I was wondering when it was going to ever be something on movies or music spin-off types🤣 thank you for this follow-up it confirmed it lol
"I will send you to Jesus"  Well I mean it´s a quick way to find him, so I don´t know why the movie is so long
I laugh when the seller say fast & frustrated hahahaha It was in my head 😃😃😃 .
You have no idea how you're "Emotional damage" influence in online games... 60% of different lobbies ive joined will have dudes imitating asian steven dad conversation and saying the punchline "emotional damage" as an asian i find this funny and proud lol
The KSI roast deserves a like. That cracked me up
I was dieing when I saw finding Jesus and bulk man😂
Best Quote of 2021: "Back in my day, we only had physical damage" --Steven He's dad
Wow I was subscribed at 500k now your at 3 *million
wonder how many attempts it took to get those poses
It’s sad because these are real movies
His video making my day beautiful
The incredible bulk was a weird movie
I've watched bronze-man from AC, and it was good
Aquafina??  *FIJI WATER* He really calling them out I caNT-
E M T I O N A L D A M A G E
Fiji water is an actuality.  Its from Fiji, it doesnt take a genius to figure
A few things make this video perfect 1) the editing to get the movie covers 2) finding Jesus 3) I want to buy "the bulk" now 4) Tom double decker bus (who should be featured in the next video)
Everytime steven uploads i think best 3 min of my day 🤣
lol
i think instead of thin diesel you should have used thin gas(oline), but it was still incredibly funny.
i had emotional damage befor u uploaded
https://youtu.be/vAvcxeXtBz0 Your Dad's motivational speaker 😅
emotional DAMAGE
1:04 Asian parent frustration
bro this guy called KSI the incredible BULK thats hilarious
Corn 🌽
Bone alone got me
Haro
If I had the last name double decker bus, I would be “Finding Jesus 2”
Koala Detour said by Steven's dad is one of my favorite lines of all time. Including movies and tv shows
I will send you to Jesus
After all this time the shop owner still jumps at the entrance of Steven He’s dad, he’s just that powerful
It's not moon battle it's sun attacks
Nice
1:20 at least he found Jesus lol
"You got squid game?"  "We got octopus contest"
0:45 "I will send you to Jesus" should be here
Steven's dad is from the matrix
Thank you for making us entertain with your vids Steven he we love you always(•‿•)(•‿•)
I'm eating quesadilla
1:23 you cannot send him to jesus because nemo has to find him first...
lets all apriciate  how much effort he put into this video also, I'm an asian
Bruhhhhhhh
I laugh so hard when I see" finding Jesus 2"
now the only thing i hear in school is emotional damage.
Stevens dad can help you find jesus
But do they have my son is a disappointment on blu-ray?
I would love an actual full unboxing video with steven's dad
When he said KSI I just can’t just cant
"You have Awkwafina? We have Fiji Water"  sir please stop but also don't stop these are hilarious 😂😂😂
Oh yeah, bringing back planking! 😆 This is better suited for when you absolutely have no idea. Let's bring it back 😎
I mean having Fiji water instead of Aquafina is a large win in my book. Would I rather drink water or plastic? Water, yes please!
"Bone Alone" .... at least it's child friendly.....   lolololololololllll
why is there a rifle above the door
"i will send you to jesus" nemo the knock-off jesus, or the actual god?
fun fact: "The Incredible Bulk" is a real bootleg movie
if steven said the line "If you want to find jesus so bad, i can send you to jesus" i would've lost it loool
Finding Jesus must had win so many grammy awards
Fast and frustrated
Your videos are the best 👍👍👍
"The incredible bulk, it's got KSI"  That's a violation
Please more Emotional damage,. I'm so addicted to it
If he needs help sending him to Jesus, he can watch the movie first. lol
I cant be the only one that thought that instead of "finding Jesus" it said "ending Jesus" i was like "damn they on a hole new mission now🤣😂"
how about robert uppey junior and tom hocean?
"I will send you to jessus "
Can you just make some merch , like an Emotional Damage t shirt, or a Just a t shirt with a picture of a slipper.
Perfect just perfect this is some classic comedy and your favorite saying in your videos "I Will send you to Jesus"
Wherever Steven goes, he got a slipper to send someone to Jesus
Missed opportunity here:  "You got Squid Game?" "Yeah, we got Splatoon."
0:28 steven He: at least it's child friendly  Off brand guy: it's about--  Steven He: IDC  my brain: it's about Drive, it's about power, we stay hungry, we devour, put in the work put in the hours and take what's ours
The second movie don't sound pg XD
KSI should react to this on his reddit 😂😂
Who else regrets knowing that the incredible bulk is actually a thing?
We just got a new meme which will never die !
👏👏
More pls maby with videogames
1:04 When your WiFi goes down
ksi the incredible bulk
“I WILL SENG U 2 GSUS” never gets old.
"We've got 'Mission Probably Not' " was the BEST line (next to the whole Marvel part - I was almost CRYING from that) IMHO! Not only will I use that phrase in my day to day life from now on, I'd watch it if it was a real movie! Hilarious as always :D
Finding Jesus LMAOOO
"At least it's child friendly"  I was thinking along the same lines :^)
Hey Steven I have an idea you could use  Minecraft-> digmake Roblox-> ro-cube Super smash bros -> special brawl sisters
idk dudes, steven hasnt been the same since he hit 1 million. at 20k (when i started watching him) he would upload every couple of days with pretty much the same quality and about 2-3 minutes of actual video. Now he uploads once a week with 1-2 minutes and another 1-2 minutes of just add. hes turned into one of those youtubers who hit 1 million and barely touch the platform again.
Emotional Damage and I will send you to Jesus is now part of my life so much so that I no longer can scream EMOTIONAL DAMAGE to people probably cuz I also try to do a Steven he voice lol
Lost Petrol > Vin Diesel
Wild knowing The Incredible Bulk is a movie that actually exists 🤣🤣🤣
'You gotta have Megaladon right?' Them: Oh we have 'Big Fish'
I swear every video has an “I will send you to Jesus part”
the fact that the first part where the store manager didnt correct him implies that some of the off brands actually have the legit dvd's on it.
I love this it’s so clever and funny
Would hqve really expected him to hold the slipper and the finding jesus in the other hand and then just slowly nod
"Mission Probably Not" 😂
the random planking challenge killed me 🤣😭
you make my day better every time you upload
INCREDIBLE BULK and than KSI lmaoooooooooooooooooo
whos off brand Steven He?
Automatically showing in 4K. High Definition Failure!
Hi
When he said "mission probably not" i was laughing so hard
They just get better and better each video 😂😂
steven is back  yay!!!!
Mission probably not has killed me 😂😂😂
wanna know the worst ? "The amazing Bulk" is really a thing .... and it is bad ..... the glorious kinda bad you want to watch while drunk and/or high XD
Awesome
I just saw Uncle Roger use "Emotional Damage" clip while ripping on Jamie Oliver and now I want a Collab.  So many great quotes on both of these channels.  Seeing bad egg fried rice "I will send you to Jesus!"
Heard ole beijing corn has sold out and is in every olympians room. Good on yah. Maybe a sponsor board on the half pipe. Or the aky slopes.
Fast And Frustrated sounds like me and my girlfriend lmao
Should have been the Slow and the Serious.
What an eldritch failure
I just remember The Amazing Bulk is a real movie thanks to this video, so uhhhh thanks for that, I guess.
EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
Hello I saw your video 2 days ago and I was laughing dying when you make that accent of the voice you did and it always make me laugh when you roast your son a lot they should have make a shirt "emotional damage" keep up the video 🤣😂👍
I will make you see JESUS
keep it going ~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣
U got mission impossible? We got mission probably not. U got me on that one-
Failure Son and the Pretenders.
If you can’t get sent to Jesus, you have to find him yourself.  *FINDING JESUS*
Steven he your so funny love the vids keep posting
*D O U B L E  D E C K A H  B U S!!!!!!*
Did you say Ksi on pouporse or just like that because Ksi is a youtuber.
These videos are great, so comedic! I watched your videos back when you posted 'why asians dont get scammed', I knew that you were going to be famous one day. Now, that you have a few million subs, I am satisfied.
For a moment I really thought your were planking in the air without a table underneath you xD Like I wanna see more behind the scenes for the planking pleeeeeease?
Lol
I don't know why but now I want to see an entire movie of The Rock and Vin Diesel being pissed off in a Prius
finding jesus 2 is a good movie
Whe u scare away customizers
These vid make me laugh so much
I love these videos. ^_^ Also 1:31. Best part of the whole video!
I’ve been waiting for this for so long
great content
🤩
LOL. Just what I needed for feeling a bit grey. Hey what happened to Steven's forehead? Did he injure himself while filming something lol
Hilarious as always  Thank you for the video
FAST AND FRUSTRATED XD
let’s go
when he said "live soft" instead of die hard, i left
The fact that at some point he's planking but leaning against the bed like an actual plank made me laugh so hard
The incredible bulk featuring KSI, now that’s a must watch
Bro I was not ready for "ksi" at the end LMFAOOOO
1:20 Finding Jesus 3
Steven's replies are great. Hell if he replied to this I guarantee it would be in all caps for sure.
Octopus Contest 😂
off brand steven: Stephany she: when everything is on brand
My favorites are "Octopus Contest" and "Moon Battle"
If you like "Finding Jesus", try "I Will Send You to Jesus"!
"I will send you to Jesus". Well... you have to find him first.
Omg I just looked it up and finding jesus is actually a thing.
"Mission Probably Not" got me good!!
Funy
We need the sidemen to react to all of his videos
Emocional damage brought me here and it was the best kind of damage that could ever happen to me  This guy is amazing
Jesus Christ died for you because he loves us and what are we doing to prove we love him? Believe and be baptized this world is coming to a close🙏🙏
finding jesus 2, a story of friends, family and faith
I love your videos
Incredible bulk ft. KSI
This is like the funnier version of the old "Blockblister" sketch from The Amanda Show 😂
THE KSI JOKE IS SO GOOD I ACTUALLY CAN'T 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Me: Do you have Steven He? YouTube: We have Stevie She.
I don't usually buy merch but I would buy an "Emotional Damage" shirt in black in a heartbeat
I'm surprised I can't see any innappropriate comments about bone alone here.
YES
*send them Jesus, send them to Jesus as fast as you can*
Do you watch charles the french?
Ah yes the new book “That” by Stephan King
Christopher Yeslin
Did he say ksi lmao😂
Me: Hey watch movie are we watching? Finding Nemo? Them: No something better. *Finding Jesus 2*
Well if you gonna send him to Jesus, you got a whole movie about finding him! Perfect!
Sheeesh
"I will send you to Jesus!" "We have 'I can parachute you near Buddha'."
JJ is gonna be mad on the incredible bulk lmao
KSI i laughed lol ksi suck. BIG FATTTTTTTTTT LOLOL
hmmm yes
This video: *off brand shit* *steven finding millions of way to balance his body on shit* *him doing weird shit* wait doesn’t weird shit go for every video?
I thought he couldn’t get funnier welp he just did
Christopher's brother. Also named Chrisopher. Different last name, though.  Makes sense.
Lol
There is actually a dog version of home alone and a movie called the amazing bulk. Completely serious
Bringing back planking i see
Why do you keep wearing a band aid now?
We got weirdo kids... so does everyone
Octopus Contest! I need that.
I will send you to Jesus 🩴
Incredible Bulk I'm died
Steven is your eye brow ok now? I noticed you didn't have a bandage on during the ad.
Omg!I subscribed 8 months ago with only 300k and now 3 mil
(has to be said aloud) Aillo, mei naim is Steven, and ei own dis shop. Evryfing ere is from ah faelure cumpanie
DOUBLE DECKER BUS??!?!?
love the meta joke at the beginning
Lol
Bone alone sounds lovely
These videos are a work of art and my favourite videos keep up the good work Steven love your videos.
KSI got hit with some “Emotional Damage”.
Double decker bus followed by I will send to Jesus and Christopher yeslen are the my favourite bits
Fast and fustrated 🤣
I want buy my bokksuuuuuuuuuuu, but there is no shipping to Brazil ........
Sad thing about it, the incredible bulk is real but without the ksi
Had me dying when he said "it's got... KSI" in Incredible Bulk
"DOUBLE DECKER BUS?!"  _Visible confused frustration_  But like...why are you standing like that😭😭? I have so many questions😂😂😂💀
1:40 if you said "Amazing Bulk" instead of "Incredible Bulk" it would have been even funnier because that movie actually exists
I was eating Bokksu while watching this because I saw you advertise it in "How Asians Pack Lunch" lol
The rage planking killed me
The Amazing Bulk is NOT BY ANY MEANS a movie we talk about
Steven He finally getting sponsers congrats
"That" 😂😂😂
when he started planking on everything💀💀💀
Ayo get this on the ksi Reddit. Love the bulking reference lol
The one with the Ferrari?  The one with the Prius (that Toyota)  That one cracked me up hard
I imagine then that Bokksu are off brand products then
What happened to finding Jesus 1
*finding Jesus 2 😭*
Did u photoshop the photos to make them off-brand or did u find then on the internet?
What a legendary guy!!! 🔥🔥🔥Keep it up, Steven. 👍
When he said We got mission probably not 🤣  I lost it
1:03 me when my brother watches 5 minute craft
Vin Diesel should been Lose Gasoline
I've seen this on tiktok already
You have become a big meme. Maybe you should tell your dad about it.
I think most Americans who have never seen or tried to buy "suspiciously similar" items that come from outside the U.S. may have some trouble truly appreciating the cutting humor in this series.
Fast and frustrated, my motto
*I will send you to jesus*
Can you make a IF SIMAN COUL WAS ASIAN
Moon battle 😂😂😂
What happened to the side of your eyebrow?
Mission Improbable
The Asian HALO
THE INCREDIBLE BULK FEATURES KSI. Man, I've died with that one
finding jesus go whoop his ass to monday
Oh no planking is back
Legit I knew this was going to be a masterpiece when he said “Thin Diesel”
roses are red  violets are blue pin this comment or you fail med school
Since Steven turns into a plank when he gets confused, ima do the same thing during tests now (I live in Japan and yes the tests are hard)
it should be "mission unlikely" instead of impossible
This video is brought to you by many squares and rectangles put together to hold things su
Did man say Ksi? LMAO
Octopus contest LMFAO
Finding Jesus is like every Christian's life lol
Stevens dad : I will sent you to Jesus.  Me : he's right there.
I just watched the others
Lowkey I saw Finding Jesus 1
At first it looked like Steven was green screening, but then he started to interact with the background in a way that made me snort loudly
What the helllllllllllllllll
I love this man🤣
The planking-
Bone alone XD
Its crazy how fast this channel grows
1:18
"I will send you to jesus" oh thats in the comedy section
Octopus contest oh
You got Fast and the furious? We got fast and the frustrated? That had me 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Finding Jesus LMaOOOO
Missed opportunity with various Asylum films...so close
Come on you can’t disrespect Ksi like that man
I've watched finding jesus          It was stupid
I will send you to Jesus LoL 🤣🤣
He will alway make us laugh
Hi
Im pretty sure the incredible bulk with ksi will still do better than our current incredible hulk
Does he respond
There was a perfect moment to say "I'll send you to Jesus" "You know where to find him?"
This skit gets any better hahah
It feels weird seeing this video of the series done in a different house

Excited for the sponsorship. Sad it’s not Beijing Corn.  Don’t worry. You’ll get there someday.
Finding Jesus! XD
why isn't anyone talking about how pure Steven's laugh is at the end
I’ve been waiting for this lol
i love how there is a lever action rifle casually hanging on top of his dorframe in the sponsor lol
Missed opputunity to call fast and furious as "slow and fraustrated"
Loved it
So I've noticed he's had a bandaid on for many of his videos. What happened??
doesnt everyone love shanghai beans
You had me at “fast and frustrated “
Have you got guardians of the galaxy?  We have caretakers of the milkyway.
Why is “finding Jesus” so expensive tho

You don’t need to find Jesus when you are Steven. His dad will send him to Jesus instantly.
Vin Diesel? More like Vincent Gasoline

You don't need the "Finding Jesus" movie if Steven He himself will send you to him after his legendary slipper quote  "I will send you to Je-sus 👞"
“So you have Disney, my favorite... duh-duh- Finding Nemo?”  *Finding Jesus 2*
Steven He: "You got Steven He?" Register: "We got Stephanie She"
The off brands are the best good vid
i love the ksi reference
My class is literally obssesed with your channel lol And so is my English teacher...... you are just too funny lol
“Finding Jesus 2” really got me laughing 😂
The way he just stand still... Like a plank... If this isn't commitment for his community I dunno what it is

I want to see an "irish Dad" episode!  Keep up the brilliant work!
"The Incredible Bulk" used to be the name of a bulk candy store where I live.
"Vin Diesel?"   "Yeah, he lost weight on that one"   "Its Thin Diesel"
The incredible bulk is just what happens when Costco creates a superhero
man has a gun in his house very asian
Steven: "to get 10%" Me in Steven's Dad voice: "TEN. PER. CENT?"
I would watch “That” 🤣🤣
Trash can’t

“ Fast and frustrated”  - Women probably   (*Joke)
The director wanted to be more specific lol

The way he perfectly flips completely straight with a straight face at 1:31 is perfect.
Thin diesel made me laugh

When he said I will sent you to Jesus he should have said we just went over that sir.
Such a short video yet so entertainment
Movie store: *has only knockoffs* Steven's dad: *plank challenge all over the store*
You are the BEST YOUTUBER EVER!, I come home from school and I love watching your videos (after HW of course, don’t beat me Steven’s Dad…) Hope your channel continues to grow Steven! 😃
The way Steven does the close up shot that then zooms out while Stevens in a stupid position is always funny. :]
This is one of my favorite series

Movie: Finding Jesus2  In Steven's mind: *I will send this man to Jesus*
*Steven’s dad grabs iPad* “It says That”. 🤣🤣😭    Edit: I wonder how much MetalMan is because maybe it can teach me how to become a complete Log like Steven’s dad!🤣😭😭
The slipper is having the time of his life.

The second you realize that "The Incredible Bulk" is a real movie
The movement you do after each off brand item is what gets me every time lmao xD
Youtube can get rid of the public dislike counter but can't put any effort at all into stopping these spambots.
Idea for next off brand vid  You got Beijing corn?  We have Tokyo carrots
"FAST AND FRUSTRATED" haha it's me rushing to the kitchen and finding out there's nothing to eat..
Emotional Damage!!
“We have bulk, it features KSI”   Bruhhhhhh 😂

The worst part is that Finding Jesus, Bone Alone and The Incredible Bulk actually exist

The Incredible Bulk is a real movie.. it's a real bad movie but it's real ha
969 views 15k likes. That is the power of Steven He.
Bro why just why MOON BATTLE REALLY 🤣🤣
Ok, the double decker bus made me audibly laugh during dinner. My brother that was wearing headphones looked at me and asked why did I laugh like that. Such a shame his English is still too basic to watch videos. That was just amazing.
He should do Charlie and the chocolate factory   Bob and the vegetable store
Movie spoiler for Finding Jesus... the main character runs into Steven's dad who sends him to Jesus... movie over.... pretty anticlimactic movie IMO... needs better cinematography... 3.14/5
"That" Got me rollin on the floor XDD
"the one with the Ferraris?" "yep, the one with the Prius"  I DIED THAT WAS TOO GOOD🤣🤣
when you can't be in a good position when you sleep: 1:02
I wish I had it but my mom and dad won't do that one thing for me
If I'm not mistaken (although I most likely am), I'm pretty sure the French version of "It" had to be translated to something that essentially means "That" because the French don't have any good words that mean "It"

There was "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!", and now we have "DOUBLE DECKER BUS!!". Life is good.
I still can't believe this guy has more than 3 million subscribers and still replies to like every level, you can see he really likes to do videos and i apreciate "That".

The Amazing Bulk is a real movie btw... Seriously... It's one of the best/worst things since The Room.
His face at bone alone had me dying
Incredible Bulk. That doesn't sound right.
I’d like to think that Steven has a band-aid on his head because he hit it and now he’s stuck as these characters.
Did man say "it's got KSI"? 😂
BRING BACK PLANKING
When is the bandaid coming off?
Ah yes. The bulk. My favourite superhero
LMAO😂
Emotional damage

"You got star wars?'' "We got moon battel" I mean, he's not completly wrong....
Whenever he hits peak "Emotional Damage" level I lose it every time
Fast and frustrated 😂😂😂
we should tell nemo he dont need to find jesus, rather ask steven to send him there
The fact that a lot of these names are actual bootleg movies makes it funnier.
,,I will send you to Jesus! But first, I will have to find him. Again"  *puts Finding Jesus 2 into dvd player*
Steven's Dad: Do you have crazy rich Asians?  Employee: No, we got stupid broke failures. Steven's Dad: Is my son the lead in that movie at least?     All jokes aside, I do love your videos. Keep up the great work.
At least when you send him to Jesus he'll be able to find him easy with that movie.

Mission Probably Not is pretty good, but there’s also Moon Battle…
Steel ball run in another universe be like: Finding Jesus
“I will send u to Jesus” Your gonna have to find him first
Me and bone alone are sadly connected.
Me and my friends cracks joke on each other   and whenever someone seems down, we cheer up saying "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE" and he replies "I will send you to Jesus"... Those moments 🤣👌 Emotional Damage Fan Club stays strong. ✨✨
I've been watching you so much recently, there've been a couple times I've read the most random sentences in your accent 🤣🤣🤣  Love your videos!!!! ❤️

My favourite one was finding Jesus than you see a fish that needs Jesus to fix that face🤣
CRISTOFER YESLAN!?!?!?!?!  that got me so well
“You got Finding Nemo?” “No we got Finding Jesus.”  Steven’s dad should’ve been like, “You want to find him so bad? I will send you to him.”
The incredible bulk is actually a real movie
“The incredible bulk, it has… KSI” As a KSI fan that had me dying 😭💀
"Fast and Furious?" "We have fast and frustrated" 😂😂😂
.
what makes me laugh more is that some of those are real rip off movies XD
The way you laid down really made me laugh 😂

Missed opportunity for Finding Jesus. The clerk could have handed the Dad a copy and said, "Here's the remastered version."
My dopamine supplier
The only thing man fears is finding jesus
I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS @Steven He
How do u have 11k likes but only 950 views
Steven's solution to any problem in life is one of two options:  1. Threaten with slipper + "I will send you to Jesus." 2. Plank in multiple locations.
Finding Jesus is just steven’s dad saying I will send you to jesus
This summer... KSI becomes... The Incredible BULK
Bone Alone is better…MUCH BETTER!
how the fuck there are 1.100 comments but 950 views
Loving these. I especially love how the guy at the store always jumps at the start when he starts getting talked to lol, does he just not expect anyone to get such off brand stuff. Also holy carp 1:04 and 1:30 is amazing. And Aqufina is Fiji, really had to do them like that 💀
The fact that at this time there’s 1,1k comments and only 936 views 😂
Finding Jesus 2
When your so early the view cant keep up with the EMOTIONAL DAMAGE comments
Wow, 23 minutes, 935 views, and 11k comments.   Wait somethings not right…
The laugh at the end 💀
yt is broken 944 views 1.122k comments and 11k likes lmao funny
he said "WEB BOI" "METAL MAN"
Emotional damage.
I really want one of these off brand videos to have Steven’s dad mention him and then the store clerk says “Oh you mean Steven She?”
Why over 1k comments, but only 900 views
Do you have Fast and Furious We Have Fast And Frustrated
This is so good
Yooo stop giving me emotional damage!
DUDE I was literally thinking about more of these at work today before this was uploaded and thought of The Incredible Hulk -> The Fantastic Bulk... I love these...
'Finding Jesus' got me
Christopher YESLAND IS GOATED IN MAN BAT  SIT DOWN

THE KSI PART AT THE END AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA😂😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that "Bone Alone" is an actual movie😂
These off brand videos are truly the best
Welcome to failure management
Your so funny when you say I will send you to Jesus
“Live soft” got me man 😂
I love these videos so much. Steven, you're awesome. Lol
Fast and the frustrated steven was the one frustrated when he said tht lol
among we
"I will send u to jesus" will go down in history
this is hilarious, but there is such a missed opportunity: When Dad said "I will send you to Jesus" the store guy should have said "We have a movie about that: Finding Jesus"
'Its got ......KSI'  I  i cant i love this
When you have an Asian accent
Here before 1000?
1:21 my personal “I will send you to Jesus” button

The salesperson is so unfazed by this.  What dimension is that man from.
"He lost weight now he's Fin Diesel"
i love your videos
I've probably been watching Steven i think about when he was to 500k or more but idk. And I remember when he reached 1 million and I was just HYPED! But... WHAT THE HAIL YOU ALREADY REACHED 3 MILLION! You maybe not failure.    Just kidding Steven always failure!
Christopher yeslin cracked me up 🤣🤣🤣
Dude I’m here before 1k views. And why there more comments than views
It suck’s that the incredible bulk is real
Emotional damage
@Steven He  you actually do own the Rolex GMT master 2 reference number 116710  don't you ?
I’m finally early
I saw that "Emotional Damage" is now a hashtag. That made me laughe before I even watched the video. Glad the algorithm is working in your favor Steven!
I love your vids.Greetings from Germany
"Finding Jesus" that was all it took to send ME to Jesus.
“We need this for the plot” covers a wide base of modern day movies 🍿
This dude really makes a shorts into video just by sponsor
the breadsticks are so cute
Cant wait for “steven heven”
"Bone Alone" sounds like an adult film title.
My biggest flex is that I was a Steven He fan before EMOTIONAL DAMAGE went viral
*Friends, Family and Faith under the sea!*  Disney brings you the now in theatres movie  FINDING JESUS 2
Christopher Yesland is the best joke by far
I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS NAH IM FINDING JESUS 2
YESSS!!!! Part 3 finally out!!!
2:01 what did he sayyy
1:50  @KSI
Home alone could've just been, away with friends
hahahahha
I have an idea for the next episode in this series, perhaps for video games.  “You got Super Mario Bros.?” “We’ve got Ultra Marcus Siblings.” “You have Legend of Zelda?” “We have Story of Hilda.” “You have Sonic the Hedgehog?” “No, we have his slower cousin, Slugger the Porcupine.” “Surely you’ve got good indie games. What about Shovel Knight?” “We have Rake Prince.” “You got Five Nights at Freddy’s?” “We have Four Evenings at Teddy’s.” “You got Undertale?” “We have Abovestory.” “ABOVESTORY???!!!!”
Really love boksu but also I'm a Muslim so I can't eat it becuz it has haram products in it if u don't know what haram is it's food that is banned for Muslim and can never lay a hand on it even if they do they'll get punished  Edit: I from Pakistan which is located in Asia so I'm kinda of an asian and we're all l like Asians Everything like asians
that instead of it cracked me up so much xD
"We could have streamed movies at home but we needed this for the plot." This video had me cracking up from the start. Lol

Did you know "The Incredible Bulk" is an actual movie?
I see it's still canon that the employee hasn't seen any customer in years, he still gets a fright when Steven appears.

incredible bulk is a genuine thing so it hits different 0-0
Anyone notice the plaster or bandage thing on Steven’s forehead? (Idk what it’s called in other countries) Hope you didn’t hurt yourself to bad you legend!❤️
Why did he do home alone as bone alone….? I was hoping for a Bone Together, or a Trap Family, you could even do Cabin Nursery
hii i ove your vidoes so much and keep up the great work!!
KSI HAHAHAAHQHAHAHHAHAHAA
"I will send you to Jesus."  That would shorten the movie by quite a lot tho.

Not "double decker bus" It's called: "DOUBLE DHECHER BUZ?!?!?"
1:20 I can't breathe💀💀
Slipper of intense bullshit equipped, +9999 damage
When your in so much disbelief you start planking
I tend to catch people’s patterns pretty quick, and so a lot of jokes get ruined cause I guess where they’re going before the punchline gets delivered. I had no expectation that this would remain funny, and yet you pull it off. Hail yeah
The incredible bulk got me so hard lol

Steven1: You got fiding Nemo ?  Steven2: We got finding Jesus  Steven1: I will send you to Jesus
This was hilarious.
I WILL SEND U TO JESUS
Fact: The finding jesus movie is literally real and its basically trying to be finding nemo but for forced christianity. There is actually a review of that somewhere around youtube and i find it laughable
movie : "finding jesus"  Steven He's dad :  "i will send you to jesus!" me: oh yeah its all coming together
Man cool way to start the day 😂 Finding Jesus 2 was jus too good 😂😂😂

God loves you all and you can all be saved (if not already) by just putting faith in Jesus Christ and repenting of sins (turning to God from sin and changing your mind on sin) And you should ask for forgiveness of your sins (this can be anywhere) have a nice day
My dads a failure
Your videos always make my day, and this video is already hilarious!

Finding Jesus 2 Is One Of The Best Movie Names If I Watched A Movie Like That I Would Watch It 5 Million Times Again And If Someone Walked In When I Was Watching It I Would Bring Out The Slipper And Say I Will Send You To Jesus
I too start planking aggressively when I see cheapo brands in a good store

First 20mins heck ya
1:44 marvellous reference 😂
Steven He's Dad :"I will send you to jesus." Store clerk: We have FInding Jesus. Right there near you. points at it*
I lost it at the planking reaction at “Thin Diesel.” 🤣
Hallo

When he said double decker bus, I was laughing so bad and idk why

Hello Steven!
Planking: Master Level
Actually what
Ayo, I'll take Fiji Water over Aquafina any day
Pov: your school just end and you saw this on your recommending page so you clicked it
The KSI part was good 😂
It is a glorious day when Steven uploads
bokksu more like boxer or box 3 ( caption pepole u will understand)
This dude never fails to entertain the crap out of me. Keep it up man.
I always wanted you to keep using "I will send you to Jesus" but more like the previous two versions of this. Maybe watch The Dragon Prince on Netflix or look up Final Fantasy VII or Tales Of Arise.
Bone alone is real
This is so good😂
amogus
Steven He's dad is the champion of planking look at that form 1:03
Hello
Bone alone got me dying😂
Jesus is but one slipper away
17minutes late
The it reference lmao 😂
I will send u to JESUS
Bone alone???
"Emotional Damage" and "I will send you to Jesus" have become an almost daily quotes since i started watching this channel about 2 weeks ago. Comedy Gold!
I didn't expect to see planking in 2022. I feel old
Yes
Snickers nah snipers
loves how the staff get jump scare every time he sees Steve dad as they soo off Brand they don't expect any customers
Emotional Damage
Steven's dad: "It says That." Store owner "Oh yeah the director wanted to be more specific."   So frickin funny! 😄
Steven He's Dad: You have Mission impossible. Store employee: We have Mission probably not.
"Bone alone" Atleast its child friendly
Someone needs to send this to KSI, he talked about bulking and KSI bulking smart joke 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"Finding Jesus 2"  Oh hey, now we all know where stevens father wants to send all those people to.
I wish we get to see Stephen She among the Off Brands.
the way I heard web boy as 'wet boy'.
for those who watch Mr steamer, it is good to see the incredible bulk get his own movie
The"fast And frustrated" is the simplest analogy of school
For someone who's 5'11, i can't say he's Bulk. But i can say he's big chungus
It's the planking that did it for me!
Am I the ONLY one kinda offended he didn't call Star Wars "Space Conflicts"?
Weirdo kids got me laughing
Look the Incredible bulk is so dumb it's good.
