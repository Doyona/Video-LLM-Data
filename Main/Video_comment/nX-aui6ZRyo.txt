Lol , how far Arteta has come . Arsenal had won just 1 in 10 games . It gives so much perspective
Four years later, Arteta is the king!!
Lol banter era over. Top of the league at Christmas
'Didn't mention the hilarious spreads on etoro! Use a professional trading exchange like FTX
Fans like DT are responsible for our mess.
Thomas Tuchel anyone?
I have no sympathy 💐 for Arsenal fans. You chose this path and AFTV helped sack Wenger so oh well.  You know, when and if Arsenal gets a new manager and they start losing again the fan channels, especially AFTV, will say the EXACT same thing 😆😁😄🤣😂😅🤓🧐🥸🤪😜
He is not going to change anything.....Arteta and Edu has no Brain.
DT is the best arsenal fans and he can run arsenal business development management DT In behave haters
I'm Wenger In.....
Ahahahahahahah
Fuk bellerin he's just avin a bad patch Barcelona want him bak so he must be OK he prob just don't fit the style arsenal play..... The 2 worst dead weights at arsenal are xhaka and mustafi... 2 of the shittest players ever 1 or 2 good games consistently followed by 3/4/5 awful games
This is pure comedy. Hope this continues and Arsenal lose many more games. Arsenal and Spuds and Chelski are comedy clubs..
Wait so Ole is a PE Teacher, Arteta is making arsenal like Liverpool, if Lampard and Ole stay he guarantees you’ll finish above them, Arteta broke Liverpool. DT is a priceless gift of stupidity that keeps on giving! You guys are getting everything you deserve. Banter FC... Dead club!
It will be better for us to get relegated, it’s the only way things will change
Get your banner out mate. Wenger out! ...oh wait
Haven't you lot been moaning about lacazette starting saying nketiah needs to be starting, arsenal fans change their mind quicker than Boris 🤣🤣🤣
Mikels at the wheel
The best presentation by DT in years , controlled and less expletives but I must say well done DT as it held my attention and very much with you in these comments - thanks for holding back on the other stuff !
There is a penalty to be paid if you break up a contract prematurely. That's what most contracts do DT. My 10 year old knows this.
Keep arteta we fucked
LLLDL that’s some form there 🤣🤣🤣
Arteta living off that lucky fa cup win imo
Eddie Howe would be a good choice as replacement. Name another manager that took a team from league 2 facing relegation to the premier League and keeping them in for 5 seasons.
Arsenal has become a chelski graveyard how can they still be playing with willian and Luiz is beyond me
Good ebening.
Keep buying the merchandise lads!
i hope arsenal are relegated and we can rid out kroenke in first place
Edu out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2020 is nearly over, we can all look forward to 2021 its going to be much better you can challenge for a title again - in  the championship.
We are in this mess because we all ganged up against Arsene Wenger now that he is OUT, its a free fall from then on!!!
Imagine supporting Arsenal lol wet club
we are the worst team in the league
Meanwhile United, who Arsenal beat, are now title contenders
Arsenal could get relegated after miserable defeat to Everton, says Alan Shearer
Sell all of the senior players...the end. Rebuild
I used to like Arsenal then i seen the fans you all deserve what you get, getting as bad as tottenham fans... fambloodFAKEasfuk
The runt was all banners and curses to chase out Wenger, now look where we are. 15th! With 12 goals in 14 games!! DT the wasteman
Different being passionate and being a dickhead. Think he should look in the mirror when he’s wearing that shitty hat.
Teams above Arsenal have worst owners than Arsenal.
Giroud winner to put Arsenal fully in the mud.
Stiff up a lip lads.. the Championship is richer than alot of 1st division leagues in Europe.. it'll be fine.. remember.. Arsenal always prided themselves in being financially stable.. it's not like they have players like Ozil that can actually make a difference.. who needs Ozil.. when there's William🤡🥴
when is DT bringing out the banners , Arteta out
Best interview I've seen from DT in all honesty
DT is an utter clown..Robbie was right. Can't take any criticism without throwing his phone away...Muppet!!!
DT you are a cheat and I hope arsenal get relegated to the conference
Willan your best player you dick
Get in liverpool,
Remember when DT said he would rather have Arteta over Ancelotti? Look at how it’s panned out. Also on Richarlison diving, anyone see Ceballos studs down on Mina’s calf and then went down injured once Mina got up? Embarrassing club, deserve everything you are getting
Exactly Ghulam Sarwar
Not an Arsenal fan but surely can feel the pain of the fans.. no fan should have to go through like this..  the problem goes up way beyond arteta n also of course individual players on the pitch..  .
Personally I think Partey, Luiz , and Ozil as attacking Mid . Or Partey, Elneny, Ozil should start in the middle
Di matteo won the champions league and got sacked in December, Arteta needs to go if this club is serious
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Just stop making videos, or at least provide constructive criticism instead of just ranting week in week out. This way, you're just making fun of yourself and the club. Peace
Arsenal should of sacked arteta and got big Sam in he'll keep you from getting relegated ahahaha
Arsenal will be win the championship next year lol
Been supporting the club since 2006, Istopped watching an Arsenal game after that devastating Europa League final defeat. My mental health is actually better now. Stressed? Take a break from Arsenal
this a real interview!
Gary Neville called it years ago...be very careful what you wish for! Amazon documentary soon come... From Champions League To The Championship 🤣
I believe it's always Honourable to admit when you are wrong and can't defend it any longer
All we need to concentrate now, is staying in the premier division.
Get over yourself  DT....!
After these last two managers of disaster Arsenal fans will be begging Arsene Wenger to return!🤣
next legend available @Pviera...2022🤣
How embarrassing to think that smashing your phone because you claimed he was lying is passion. Embarrassing fans and channel
RObbie loves when the manager is being questioned! He as an Arsenal fan and he as the owner of AFTV surely cause some conflicts of interest.
It’s ridiculous how arsenal have to rely on young players every game it’s saka starting a move, we put on martinelli we play like a different team. Willian, Pepe are meant to be showing example to saka and martinelli not vice versa
“Laughs his way to the bank”
Willian has been Willian since he joined PL, remember one time he couldn't preventing poor crosser like Wan bissaka and Chelsea conceded a silly goal. We warned you people but Deluded DT  and his friend Robbie comfortably said he's better than Ziyech. Enjoy your downfall, we really love to see it.
hahahahahahahahah - from united fan!
As a man u fan we were about to sack Ole but then in January we got Bruno and it changed everything
Nothing wrong with the manager, Carragher got it spot on......he needs another 2-3 transfer windows to make his mark and bring in what he needs. Current crop isnt good enough.  Nketiah didnt get a start for Leeds yet he gets into our first 11.......that right there tells you how low our standards have fallen. nuff said.
I pray whoever sees this become successful 💙🖤
I mean he is only human after all
How can you blame wenger for the mess yous are in now ffs man
Things will get better guys support the club. Transition is a very painful process , I watched Arsenal legends of Thierry and Bergkamp and just got another perspective..
it's karma, should have thought of this when ya'll want wenger out, don't you think wenger hurt too back then?
Grown ass men throwing phones about watching football. Smh
Where is masks ?
Useless
ive been saying eddie is useless and selfish, we should loan him and then sell him if possible
No more love for arsenal. Just love if arsenal collapse.
You make a mistake.. arsenal should bring ancelotti, before he goes to everton.. look everton now. arteta is not the right guy
What’s wrong with losing to a better team?
*Arsenal fans were warned about wanting Wenger out. Fans are deluded at the best of times, but, Arsenal fans really were deluded about their hopes post Wenger & their estimation about Arsenal's place in the football world.*
DT when you just love Arteta even though we are sitting in 15th in a league. That's your personal reasons related with him. When even Arsene Wenger was coach even 5th place everyone screaming for him to be replaced. If this is still your view then whatever f**k your view may be doesn't even matter to anyone. Showing anger infront of camera doesn't shows whatever f**k you're trying to prove. Arteta got no experience at all we need proper manager atleast to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Get him  f**k out of this club.
Actually talks a lot of sense, unlike his last performance. Changing the manager now sorts nothing.  Club has been in a mess for years and needs  an overhaul - changing manager is not going to sort it.
I’m loving this 😂
Chill out lads "it's only a game"
I feel the pain too broski
Nketiah is really not a good enough!!  To me he is  our fifth choice striker, and behind Balegun.  Martinelli is number two, for me.  I have never rated Nketiah.  Arteta should leave and we have a fresh start, not all Arteta's fault.  But leave...
Instead of constantly bashing an academy product in Eddie why don’t you mention £75M record singing Pepe who’s been absolutely useless since signing?
This season is a write off. Give Mikel until April/May. If it's still not turning the corner, start scouting a new manager for summer.
Willock and Nketia not worthy to have a permanent shirt in Arsenal simple...this is not child's play...we should bring in experienced players like Ozil to play for us
1:00 how many times are you lot gonna say this sack the manager guess what you've had about 690000000 managers Bruv  so chill
here as a laugh as a chelsea fan but dt speaking some truth. but arsenal fans need to realise this is probably the biggest job in football atm, the disconnect between what the fans expect and where the team is is insane. but following an inexperienced coach under whos claim to fame is as an understudy to manager currently under scrutiny for being unable to build/maintain a team from scrap peps got great coaching philosophy but his inability to make a team better in the transfer market is startling
Simp DT
lol arsenal are shite
Iwobi😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
Is he finally realizing Wenger was the don? They got what they wanted...now enjoy it.
DT is an absolute prune
Just hire Neil warnock...He is capable for bringing u to the top          IN Championship  lol 😄
You forced out our best ever manager and this is what you get.
LOL! "win the odd FA cup" Wenger won it 3 times out of his last 4 years at the club ffs! Leave it out! I am not sure why it's taken so long for people to see that Nketiah , Willock and Saka are not ready. The only one of them i would keep in January is Saka as our project player that's it. The rest can go on loan. As for Willian ,i never really was hyped about him joining Arsenal because i feared the worst. Even at Chelsea he was in and out of games , hot and cold and that is not what we needed. He was at an age where you were rolling the dice in hoping he would be rejuvenated to a level somewhere near his best and its backfired.
Don Robbie tries to bait DT so he can get more likes
Bring back Wenger
willian is taking the piss out of arsenal just like many players over the last few seasons
I think if we play the team plays in europer league 🤔  maybe we will get positive result cuz they are more aggressive than 1st team
Dt has behave on his hat and his smashes his phone like that 😂
We are not a big club if we don't get rid of him
It’s funny how all these fans think they know better than someone like wenger. Arsenal never looked this bad under him. Fans like DT forced wenger out the door. I don’t think he would’ve won the league without serious investment but can anyone honestly say he would’ve been worse than Emery or arteta?!  You can all thank wenger for getting your team to the great heights you think it is in your head. Without wenger arsenal would be nothing.
arse good club once  good mixture of overseas and british  players   But now embarressment to English footie   foriegn to the core  no identity  we love to see clubs like them being crap  serve's them right
Another day another black eye for DT’s missus
Remember you guys made a damn music video for Partey before he even kicked a ball
a moment of silence for DT's phone
Something has to change.  I have been looking at sky sports ever since the result yesterday waiting for his sacking.  But nothing
Wenger was a big part of the problem. The way they run the club Wenger & Kroenke any manager after him didn't have any chance.
robbie , don't just keep saying win win win, you should think and ask how! Everybody knows they want to win, who doesn't? But how? Did Arsenal solved the problems? No. Same owner , same structure. You have to tear it down man.
DT - I would love to have a conversation with you about your morals and ideas regarding this channel. If you cared about the club enough surely you wouldn’t spit as much venom as you do every week. Let me know when you’re free mate.
Reality is ....ur pathetic
U sound like a ........... crying. .Arsene karma hunting you
I thought we played decent, especially Lacca when he came on. And Robbie is right, Everton are a top 4 team now. We need to be looking to get points from those around us and try to get to mid-table for the new year. A title push and top 4 is still not out of the question given how everyone is taking points off each other in the top 6. I'm feeling good since Arteta needs some time and he's already snagged a trophy.
And some of you Arsenal clowns said you will challenge for the title this season 🤐
hahahahah, when lacazette was starting, dt was saying nahh get nketiah in wtf is laca doing playing
Banners have been running in the family 😂😂😂😂
Øzil is living his best life, sitting at 350 000 £ per week doing nothing 😂😂😂🤣
DT is a lunatic
I'm buying arteta a lighter for xmas!!!😃😃.............why??? ......coz he keeps losing his matches 😂😂😂😂😂
"The disease". Sounding like Randy Marsh
Arteta cannot make his own decisions, Edu is useless just like Brasilians Louis and Willian... It's Arteta's mistreatment of Ozil hunting him...
God be with Arsenal FC in the coming days
Wenger Back is the only solution🤒
What a lovely couple
DT logic If i am wrong i am wrong  If i am right I am right 😂😂😂    Are we still rats for wanting Arteta out?
Perfect example of Arsenal supporters
Just like Arsenal
What an embarrassing couple
Feel your pain dt I’m a Leicester fan but been following aftv after we beat you everything you have said is bang on the problem starts at the top Leicester had to go to league one before they could start again with new owners and it was painful but the rise has been amazing but that was 10 years ago you boys are in for a long ride but if I was an Arsenal fan I’d be looking at the top they are treating Arsenal like an NFL’ franchise they know you will keep coming back as hard as it sounds maybe you need to go down to get them out keep the faith but easy for me to say we are second dave
So how do we change the ownership because we can keep complaining about Kroenke but we need to start showing that we are gonna do something and not just watch our club become a buisness
Where is Balogun why would he sign a new contract when he scores when he gets a chance but is never picked in the PL squad?  Auba is out and Martinelli is just back from injury Eddie is useless and Balogun is not getting an opportunity its chocking
Well DT wanted Wenger out cos he wasn’t happy with top 4 trophy
GLAD THAT HE ACTUALLY MAN UP AND SAID HE WAS WRONG I MYSELF KNEW ARTETA WASNT OUR GUY ALL THE WAY FROM LAST SEASON AND I NEVER WENT AGAINST MY GUT TO THINK OTHERWISE NOW THAT THE TREE IS FALLING COZ THE ROOT IS ENTIRELY ROTTEN  I JUST WANT TO SEE THOSE FANS WHO CALLED ME PLASTIC WHEN I SAID ARTETA OUT EVEN AFTER FA VICTORY
When will the board sack arteta ?, I guess they prefer seeing arsenal in championship next year, stupid ass board, they fired emery when arsenal wasn't even this bad, and they back arteta until the end of the world
Bring back Wenger 😂😂😂😂😂
Kondoo
Arsenal must fire some of it's own fans especially Troopz. The "manager out" and associate fan pressure will stop.  😁😁😁😁😁
@DT hahahahahahaah
We're all sitting at home laughing
Not if he loses them he already has. Auba is veering towards turning against him, Willian already has, David Luiz has amongst others
😅😅😅😅😅😅. Arsenal can eat a dick 😅😅😅😅😅
He has to go but he won’t be sacked so that is how it is and there is no passion and no fight and the players aren’t playing for him anymore
This guy is a scumbag hypocrite.
If Willian has 3 year contract yous are destroyed 😂
What a fckin tool this guy is..
@13:56 ... DAMN
Laca starts, fans moan that Eddie should start. Eddie starts, fans moan that Laca should start. Moan FC
Yay well done to Arsenal for losing against the toffees and making them swap with spurs did nobody else notice this or was it just me thousands of spurs fans screaming come on don’t lose get that point allow us to battle with Liverpool but ha ha you are not top any more you’re not even second...Don’t worry we’re too good to go down and we may even get something again
stop buying arsenal merch
Do you want us to feel sorry for you or something? Nobody has a problem with your opinion. But when you start this RAT stuff, don’t start crying when it comes back to you. And you say others are “abusive”
The moment I knew Arteta did not have the mentality to lead this club: signs Partey and leaves him on the bench when he was ready to play. We lost all the excitement we had over transfer signings.
Except for one or 2 players, we've got a team of bench players. Leeds decided not to pay £5 mill for Rob Holding and we make him captain.....
Eddie isn’t good enough. No disrespect
I love this game
I like DTs honesty and I respect that, we all hurting right now
DT ain’t all bad, he gets unnecessary stick imo. It’s just passion. I say dumb stuff all the time when I’m angry
Ego death. I'm feeling this and Im Chelsea
I love how hard he’s trying not to scream like a little girl in this video. What a complete knob jockey this guy is hahaha
I can't back the manager, keeping Willian on and Holding, Nketia and Bellerin starting
Lol he is admitting that he got it wrong 😉
I’m a Reading supporter, but my good these 2 men know what they’re talking about. I feel for Arsenal. Get the players out, not the manager
Arteta out we need experience manager
Shoutout the sponsorblock user for skipping these sponsors
Arteta is the man for the job. I am still, Arteta in. You don't jump ship when things get hard, when we were winning games and when we won the FA Cup and Community Shield it was all good. And now just because we're losing games it's Arteta out- nah man. There's still a long way to go and I am backing him all the way, we will start winning big again!
DT said he's a virgin, it's hurting...
DT SAD SAD
Do these guys realize that getting good players in January is typically very difficult? Even if Arsenal had City's funding, it's unlikely they'll get the 3 or 4 players they need to turn this around AND players need time to gel with a new team.
DT is looking more and more rough each week - who agrees?
Stan pussy comes during week and say's he's selling the club. That would be the best Christmas present ever.
Just eat humble pie and realise you're not a top 5 club anymore.
Hopefully DT does himself in soon enough
This is coming from the same guy who was always screaming Wenger out, a lot of people wanted this change, majority of Arsenal fans are to blame for this as well. This was their wish. I’d stick with Arteta, end of the day it’ll be another two years with some other manager until there is a bit of progress made. Can’t get worse than it is now surely? It’s a painful time but we are Arsenal fc, we get through it!
Modern football only makes sense if you accept it as being designed  to make you miserable.
Arsenal needs better fitness coaches too. Key players getting injured more than normal and it begs the question what the coaches are asking of them. Oi, carry us please mate.
I said from the start we should of got Ancelloti.  Arteta is not a manager he's a coach.  No creative players, no one in the box Tierney was our best player in fact he was the ONLY player doing his job. You give Holding Cpt what a joke? Half the player's don't care
Wenger be Like " Miss me B**** "
Wowwww I can see how much it hurts for u guys and as a Man Utd fan enough is enough get him out u guys don’t deserve this
Willian at Chelsea was a workaholic when we sold him to you guys he changed 🤣🤣
Arsenal will win the league 🤣🤣
Definitely back him massive clear out needed
He does it all the time of set species
One thing is, no one is talking about leno. He worries more about the players and pushed saka and then left the goal open for mina. If we left the players and stayed back he saves that easily
The performances from arsenal are a joke, but the amount of mid rolls on this video is unforgivable
Dt is just a baby can't take it but thinks its ok to give it
If Arsenal is relegated that will be the end of AFTV. The channel is having views because of the rivalry between Arsenal and the tops team in the league, a lot of rival fans watch this channel.
Eddi is not good enough for arsenal
arsenal are 15th
Why is the white guy taking like he’s from the Caribbean?
ARTETA IN !!!
Sorry lads but that's just the difference between an Ancelotti team and an Arteta team. One guy is proven and one guy put out cones for Pep...
DT is fair and if any fan mocks him for being mad get a grip you ain’t a real fan if you don’t show emotions through the game
How can you even complain about Willians lack of passion. He’s a Chelsea player, with no desire to come to a sub par arsenal, I’m surprised he bothers to turn up for training.
So, this time, Xhaka is off, Bellerin is off, so... who is to blame for this defeat then, Wenger?
Still trust in Arteta
Dt you little mug 😂😂😂
Agent Willian at it again Up the Chelsea
We are observing this situation since our club is in a similar situation. 🔵🔴
Why are you lot blaming the manager have you seen the state of your squad
Finishing 4th year in year out wasnt good enough for you and got banners in to get rid of wenger bet you wish he was still there. Laughing at Chelsea for changing managers and not giving time hahaha be careful what you wish for
I’d bring back David Dean as chairman, it’s never been the same since he left!!!
The repercussions of `Wenger Out`
Fair play DT speaks facts and shows emotions
Surely he didnt chuck his phone hard enough🤣
DT in 50 years time: Wenger's dead but all this failure was due to him
I was worried DT would break the mic 🎤 today... the players need to buy him a new phone
I’ve said this in a previous video and will continue saying it.  The problem is bigger than arteta.   Although he does need to go, it’s not because he’s a bad manger but the fact that the football he wants to install into Arsenal is out of Arsenals depth, in terms of the current players he has and the financial backing from the board.  Arsenal right now has 0 appeal.. not contenders for the league or top tier European football, even the name “Arsenal FC” doesn’t have the same weight as it used to...the football arteta wants to play is expensive and requires class and word class players, the only two players that spring to mind in Arsenals squad is Auba and Ozil, yes the likes of Saka is playing well but that’s a fraction of the entire squad... the time where Arsenal could pull big players has passed, look at Manchester City with pep, it’s taken time for him to get a squad that can play his style, it’s taken time to experiment and build depth, but he’s backed by the board and has repaid them with domestic titles and quite frankly at the very least, some of the best football in the world has seen.  Arsenal can’t replicate that, so he needs to go....   Arsenal have made some shocking signings and is another reason for their downfall, buying players past their peak, Lacazette should’ve been a signing they made season prior to getting him but Arsenal is the sort of club that will happily wait for a players form to dip or age a little and get players on a sale, or now becoming a feeder club for players to look towards when they want a easy ride to end their careers, happily taking fringe players from the likes of David Luiz or Willian, who both won’t make it into the current Chelsea 1st team, I guarantee we will see Benzema in a Arsenal kit, when he’s at the ripe old age of 36 😂.   Once the boards attitude will change, Arsenal will change. Uniteds banter period is coming to an end, why? Because they have had the boards backing and have retained their good signings and let go of the bad, Arsenal signs bad/cheap and keeps them
You lot flew planes over the Emirates saying wenger out
I honestly fell sleep as the game started and woke on the 94th min so I’m glad of that
Pepe, Partey, Gabriel, all bought to the club with glowing cv's and have all fell down the same rabbit hole,  big changes needed
What difference three months make. The gloating on how they got Willian on a free back then. Just another two and a half years left on his deal.
This is getting that deep the Americans might run hopefully
We are terrible and somehow getting resualt  feel bad for you really do from a toon fan you will play us and turn the corner trust 😭
I’m done now it’s time to go for another manager I wanted it to work but it’s not it’s not even slightly looking like it is working
Highering arteta was nothing but joke..
All this problems started after the Ozil incident, till then this same group of player looked some team under Arteta. I think Arteta is a great coach I still think hes one of the best but hes still naive in player management this is where he got this wrong
You want to keep "senior" players happy, Willian, Luis, Lacazette, two Chelsea agents and can't score won't score, you'd be better off playing the kids week in week out, because they'll be the ones starting for arsenal in the championship next season after all the seniors have set sail for pastures greener
Why contradicting yourself some time ago you were complaining that he is starting lacazette over the energy youth now you complaining that he should be starting experience over the same youth you were bigging up
Hahaha
DT constantly, not just in this video, but in previous ones also, says he backs Arteta, yet spends the whole time criticising the team & tactics that Arteta plays. What is it?
Not getting Sam Allardyce was an error on Arsenal's part. He would save them from relegation 👀
Arsenal always gets Chelsea Rejects, and mercenaries who want to destroy Arsenal. I like DT they brought us the Chinesevirus spreading quickly.
we need experienced players....but first ozil
We want Wenger back
Arterta is a struggling coach who has very below average players....some of Arteta's tactical  decision has been very poor to say the least. The problem has always been the recruitment in the last 8 years, even in Wenger latter tenure. Until the board recruit top quality players I'm afraid that this is what Arsenal fans should get use to.
How far they have fallen since this muppet and his cronies were screaming Wenger Out
Remember when the Wenger Outers werent happy with 4th? These guys were spoilt 😂
Emery is sitting in the top 4 in Spain laughing at all this
When you lead the "Wenger Out" charge, the VERY WORST thing you can do, is publicly back a succeeding manager who gives Arsenal their worst start in 50 years, 14 games into the season.
Build from the back with no nonsense new British defenders that know what playing for a top English club means  stop buying reputation players and get some hungry young players in with the odd experience players and take this club forwards .arsenal won't go down but this season is about building .get the younger players in to gain experience stop looking up and look to next season .drop players now put young arsenal players in who want a chance ffs
DT is beginning to metamorphosize into TY.  Let’s not point the finger at Willian, we took on the two Chelsea rejects.  What club would let 2 of their most valuable assets go to a rival?
Tbf to DT, this was a very good interview. He acknowledged the problems and admitted he's probably gotten it wrong with Arteta. I don't like the guy, but he stood up and owned up to everything in this interview, it takes a strong man to do that. Fair play.
His phone took it like a champ.
A wise man once said be careful what u wish for
Where d'you get that top DT, old skool Arsenal Crest. Shades of 89. THE BEGINNING OF GOOD OL' DAYS!!!!
Dis broda lost Ur talking to urselfs  u are delusional
Wenger out
This is combination of lack of investment. Lack of continuity on Transfer market. Lack of ambition from the ownership  Poor culture which produces poor performance.  Ownership need to support Arteta with players he needs.
If we leave arteta, arsenal will get relegated the chap doesn't have what it takes to change it around..all dis guys stupid men.     I swear llumberg wud have done Betta all dis support Ur giving to dis fraud city nd Everton fan that we have as manager if we had backed llumberg lik dis trust me llumberg wud do Betta we wud be in Betta position now..I swear.. llumberg will be lik lampard at Chelsea ill rather that than dis shii.. who are we goin to beat I'm this league now lool get rid of dis  guys talking shiii asking wrong questions all the time...stay quiet.. llumberg will express himself nd the players wud be more free to xpress themselves around llumberg more nd trust me llumberg will keep it comming arsenal is he's life he wud do anything for this club... Get rid of dis idiotic 🤖 robotic manager asap. Even everything Ur doing with Ur guys it shud be only wit yous in ur dressing room but dis idiot comes out talks bout everyone nd all the plans he's a fool
We were alot better when sokratis was in the team🤷🏾‍♂️
My crystal ball showing me Arsenal in the Championship
U let david luiz french brother leave he was probably the only player that had a bit of bark about him, as a united fan I'm loving this
Leeds fan here,It is shocking to see the lack of fight from the players and style of play Arteta is playing.I think Arteta has to go the players are not playing for him.Under Bielsa William would not have been coming back out for that 2nd half given his lack of effort in the first,anyway all the best for the rest of the season.
Karma is a bitch. These ungrateful spoil supporters disrespect the club legend manager Arsene Wenger that make club watchable in 90s & 2000s plus winning things when Arsenal use play horrible style off football. Then hear and see these worst set of supporters campaigning in & out stadium bout wenger out. Them say always be cafeful what you ask or wish for.
That knob and his mates helped bring this about by hounding out the greatest manager they ever had and ever will have.

Karma gets you. Wenger out has come back to haunt you big time
Least it’s his phone getting thrown about and not his mrs
DT wishing the team would show the same sort of 'Passion' as him by throwing his phone and storming off like a petulant child. Same sort of 'Passion' that got Pepe a Red card that DT slammed him for. Hypocrisy off the scale.
FAIR PLAY FOR ADMITTING THAT IT LOOKS LIKE HE WAS WRONG BACKING HIM .
No Bellerin or Xhaka to blame this time lol
CHELSEA FANS TOLD YOU ALL WILLIAN PICKS AND CHOOSES WHEN YO WORK HARD AND THE MEDIA LAPS IT UP YOU DIDNT WANNA LISTEN
Arsenal gonna win the League ......next year in the Championship league 🤣🤣🤣
As a Spurs fan, even this is hard to watch for me, you can see the guy is actually suffering
Wenger was a top 4 manager
Farmer club
Judging how solid DT's phone is. It should be among the Back 4 against Chelsea.
Their is some questionable decisions that were made by arteta today I for one would like to give him a chance to bring players in in January but he's really not helping himself playing N over lacca and keeping willian on?
Useless team
DT is a clown. Arteta is awful there’s no recovery with him.
We need professional coach look at Everton I think in a couple of years they will be one of the top club in premier league we need some one to turned round for good  remember ones we was at the level of bayern Munich
Don Robbie has bought Etoro.. now using his main business to promote his company. What an inspiration!
I think Arteta will be gone by Brighton.
Huge problem we have is having the same core in the team from Wenger days, if you look at Liverpool they have no one left of there old squad, city have ageuro that’s it, same as United
Arteta out , he wasn't a great player anyway. 1) He should have started laca over Nketi. 2) he should have started Willock over elneny. 3) remove cellabos from the mid and put Willian in the middle with willock. 4) Martinelli wide in willian position. 5) holding is below useless, shouldnt be on the pitch. Where is sokratis🤷🏾‍♂️
The irony DT talking about there being a disease and a rotten core in the club but he is both to the fanbase with his anger issues and outbursts. This bad form is what some gooners deserve for the abuse they gave Wenger.
Going to January is another waste of time we need fresh blood right now you got sarri and allegri available one of them can turned round they have no pressure arteta got lots pressure
Why isnt anyone talking about PEPE! He is our most expensive player and he hasnt performed to the standard he alwasy diasapoints us!! He only knows one thing cut in and shoot and nine out of tens times he dosent hit the target!!
Wenger and Ozil right now 🤔🤔🤔
"If he had as much passion as me, he would have played better" These armchair fans think they can step in as if passion is all they need
Almost need arsene wenger to come in till the end of the season... oh the irony 😂😂😂
DT is part of the problem. Fans who keep wanting a delay in sacking Arteta. You will finally want to sack him when Arsenal is playing in the Championship
Chelsea sending Trojans to Assanal disguise as Anti Virus
Take your time wid it 🤣
Changing manager is just a Short term fix and just plasters over the cracks, until a year later we’ll be in the same position
Persist with arteta and expose the root problems! Hopefully this gets kroenke out
You all turned on Wenger.   You reap, what you sow.
Hang on a minute a few weeks ago you were slamming lacazette? Starting nketiah only looks bad in hindsight, laca has been completely ineffective as a striker
The arteta out brigade are just short sighted narrow minded and desperate, and understandably just a way of the fans taking back a bit of control but the problems will persist afterwards
Luiz isn’t that bad tbh, it’s just Willian which is probably our worst signing in years, even Micki/Sanchez swap looks better than his signing
DT slowly coming to terms with the fact Arsenal are in a relegation fight... Soon he will also realise AFTV is a MASSIVE symptom of the disease he's talking about!
Ffs I'm hurting too.
Tbf to Arteta your squad is worse than than Everton’s, wolves and Leicester
We ain't doing nothing in January
Dt was one of the wenger outs clown too busy looking over the fence had to learn the hard way that the grass ain't always greener the board has no interest in competing at least wenger did and at least we played respected football now look
DT's phone has more defensive capabilities than Arsenal's
this 40+ years old man behaves like a child on camera, he's so immature. he needs to go anger management class. Why AFTV keeps bringing him in? He brings shame to adult for his behaviour
Last 2 games we got points we had 10 players. Maybe we should start with 10 against Chelsea and the team wil be forced to fight
The question is, which top manager is available that could replace Arteta? There is Poch, who will never manage Arsenal, because of his Tottenham history. Maybe Favre, who just got sacked by Dortmund. Then again, is the problem really the manager? 🤔
You hounded Wenger out. Huge mistake and lack of respect
The only big issue is what arteta Should be selling outside of train stations
Cmon Chelsea ☝🏾🙏🏾
Like DT, I'm hurting. I'm worried!!
going down lads!
Easy win for us
"Take your time with it, take your time with it" Arsenal died on their ass since that dance haha!
I’m a Manchester United fan and don’t care enough to look deeply into it, but if I was Arsenal I would keep him until January and back him in the transfer window. No decent manager is going to damage their reputation by joining a club in 15th, possibly 16th if Brighton win today...
Thats better than a Christmas movies !!! 😅
Arteta needs time
DT slags off the board and wears the new jacket 😬
I know DT is passionate but that behaviour at the end of the match was was not acceptable
DT is biggest fraud
Quality or standard of the players are not good enough to play in premiere league...
Ozil & Willian ...£600,000 per week. Take that in, how can a club run efficiently with madness like that.
Arteta is a HYPOCRITE. He keeps playing players who are consistently not performing, but in the press conferences he's like "I only choose players that work hard." Give me a break... I'm expecting us to lose against both City and Chelsea, obviously...
Allegri still available boys, better pick him up before ManU does. Quality manager
I dont understand you fans,the same you will be criticising laca, now laca is on bench your complaining. ARTETA SHOULD STICK WITH EXPERIENCE PLAYERS AND WORKRATED PLAYERS SIMPLE!!
Why do we keep on saying that we sacked Freddie, he was just an interim manager, awaiting the signing of Arteta so he was not sacked.
Leeds 2003.
This is DT at its best and being honest. You have a right to be angry DT. A club the reputation of arsenal shouldn't be in this situation for so long. The issue is the owner and the recruiting system. A big shift from what we believe has cost and continue to cost us
With DT on this.
United fan here and I must say, this isn't classic AFTV banter anymore. It's now sad and very alarming what is happening at Arsenal.
Both willian and holding got some blame in that first goal....
DT is not to be taking serious anymore! Every week you are changing opinion... You’ve disrespected Wenger pfff This was never so bad! With this team you can take lot more out of it
STFU dt stop saying willian the whole time. The guy is new in the team and he didn't choose to stay in the game. The manager is to blame in every game. He saw him play last time and if he chooses to play him again and again then you see that the manager is poor. Fo!!!!
We can’t wait to play Arsenal on Boxing Day! COYB 💙✅
This football team is rotten and stinky
Never thought I see the day that Arsenal are worse off than 00s Spurs teams lol
Did you dash your phone DT?
Rival fans used to say without Wenger Arsenal would be in a relegation battle. Now here you go.
Take care DT, your health and children are more important than any football club
Emery : GOOD EBENIN😏😏.... 😭😭😭
Holding is getting away with another 3/10 performance 😌 most of these young players are not good enough they too comfortable.
DT - does that make me less of a fan or bad person  Also DT - there all rats!!!
Remember when that clown ian Wright said man United would be title contender if Arteta was  the manager
You guys need to loan those children playing for you and go out and get quality players. It’s not the coach.
He needs to go!!!! KMT
ROB HOLDING.. the next tony Adams.. hahah the disrespect to your legend
I am not a Gooner but Arsenal FC should humble themselves and bring Ozil back into that team. They are so flat without him. Otherwise, the writing is on wall; Arterta is getting closer to a sack considering their coming games. I don't see them winning any of them.
Since AFTV has grown in popularity, Arsenal have been diminishing. The way we praised the team after man utd win lol what a joke our performance did not merit a win.
LOL
BLAME THE BOARD , thats where your problems starts , as it does in every big company. Arteta is now third in a row fired ( including Wenger ) , firing is NOT the solution you are looking for.
Waffle, waffle.
As if Ozil and others are going to say "Yea, just rip up my very lucrative contract" what planet are you on?
Ralf Rangnick ..will be appointed arsenal manger soon.........
Trust the process
As a Roma fan, thank you for Mhiki! He has been in scintillating form since he left your club. Cheers!
You were very wrong with Arsene Wenger
I don't really like DT but I don't remember him comparing Arteta to Emery. Be fair to him guys. Love the banters anyway.
Funny like he keeps going on about the squad not being good enough....possibly with the injuries it has effected them a bit, a fit Partey makes a difference. Mari maybe at the back. But not including Ozil, who should play in certain games and even Saliba is strange. I know its still only potential with him but he has a bit of class. Play him, Gabriel or Mari, Tierney, Niles, Partey, Martinelli, Auba, Pepe/Saka, Ozil....the bones of a decent team. Certainly their squad is better than Everton, Southampton, Leicester, Villa n the likes who are doing well. But i think the managers of those teams know what theyve got n what theyre trying to do and the players are performing. These guys.... letting down the club. A VERY similar situation at united...except Bruno is carrying the team.
DT u have spoken well,very accurate..our disease remains the same
bring arsène wenger back
When you start with Eddie, Holding, Mitland-Niles etc. and then bring in Willock and Martinelli while chasing points, it becomes clear how far we have fallen..
The reason Nketiah couldn't get in our team was that Bielsa kept faith in Bamford. He did score five goals for us.
That’s why I like DT 👍🏽
Long live arteta...I luv watching aftv after an arsenal loss...makes me feel so good!!! Cures all my depressions
DT I'm Spurs, and I do love listening to you, such passion and truth
We can never replace Arsene Wenger.
DT is a true fan. Kudos.
Love him or hate him DT talks sense
Please William, come back home and we will have you back
eddie next time when you get a chance 'TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT 😂😂
The thing is - We need star players like Ramsey, Rosicky, Walcott, Sanchez and Van Persie. We can no longer create star players, Arteta is no Wenger he is too young. He cannot produce stars, but if given stars he will be able to do wonders with managing Arsenal I am sure.  Even he's a student of Wenger for heaven's sake. Fellow gunners, please accuse the financiers and capitalist management of Arsenal, not our own Arteta.
Arteta was never a coach
TIME for the ARTETA IDIOT to GOOOO!!!!!!! 👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉👉
Theyve left it too long to change the manager cos the man they need is gone to West Brom. Pulis maybe?
mikel aerta has broken klopp 😂😂😂😂👍🏾
Trust the process aftv especially Dt!!
I actually feel sorry for DT now, I was very critical of him but he's a fan after all
When arsenal beats man United DT " man United players wake up and hope that Fulham should lose west broom should loose shu should lose because that's their standards " 😂😂 karma gets to everybody deal with it 👍😂
OZIL is not the disease DT
Dt is just an actor all through this you can predict what he does next it’s pathetic really
lol....stop crying girls...
Dortmund fired their coach after just one humiliation, how many times does Arteta has to humiliate us before he is fired. Arteta is inexperienced.
I have no sympathy for this scruff, proper big mouth bully
You guys threw out Wenger our best manager and now you better be ready to be hurt. Wenger was hurt the way you dealt with him.
*PLEASE keep sending in DT super chats to wind him up*
At what point does DT admit to himself that he played a big part in the demise of Arsenal?!?! When they lose at home to Dorchester Town?!?!
Imagine play Chelsea  with Willian upfront  David Luiz at the back 'the game is sold!. Luiz red card. Willian will give those crosses  rhat will end up as a throw in  from the  other side.  This Brazilian  syndrome
You have 2 learn how 2 lose my yute...
Serious question for AFTV and DT: Please clarify how Arteta has broken Klopp?
Relegation form 😅🤣  YNWA ✌🏾
Even DT has given up rants
Save us, Lord Wenger....bring us back to some glory again
3 points is the only thing robbie cant buy these days 😂😂😂
What language  is the pink mans talking.
Thomas Partey could have been enough if we didn't exile Ozil. Leno Saliba Luiz Gabriel Niles Ozil Partey Saka Pepe Lacazette Auba
Do any of you guys realize that your squad is just not good
Relegation incoming 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am only human after all don’t put the blame on me
DT needs therapy. Hug DT 😔
Man United back their managers more than Arsenal's, even though both clubs have terrible boards
Why are you talking about a Mesut Ozil contract in this? Face the coach picking wrong team. Holding didn’t take the captain band himself. Saliba is the coach decision. Martinez is the coach decision
I really don’t want to admit it but it’s time for a new manager
DT is realy kid
Players to keep Leno Gabriel  Martinelli Tierny Partey Saliba Ceballos Aubameyang Lacazette  Build the team around these players. Get rid of everyone else. Only player close to make it in is Pep but he has been given too many chances now. Off you go. Would have had Ozil in
Violins🤣
This guy hasn't got a clue, Never heard such uncoordinated babble... he's all over the place.
Enjoy the EFL wankers
Sack him our club is embarrassing  hes  no good
The reason why I'll continue to blame Arteta for all this mess up. (1)what was the reason he resigned Ceballos loan again. (2)He signed Willian also 32yrs of age,Chelsea reject. (3)extend Luiz contract for what reason. (4) he keeps those lazy players without selling or terminate thier contract because Arteta and 1 knows well those players are dead. (5) Banish Saliba and Ozil. (6)Full transfer window,No play maker signing. (7)Arteta is not the answer to arsenal problem bcs He's Inexperience Coach with No plan B tactics.
William's too old to stop cross 😬
Willian is our top assist player with 3! He got those in round 1!! Bellerin 2, Auba, Ceballos and Nshitiah 1. Creativity flows in the team.
Arteta Moyes needs to stay 👍🏽😂
Big up DT fair play comin doing his fam cam he's backed arteta like most have. I think we need to get rid of him it's clear most are not giving 💯 for the manager
My favourite channel at the moment
Arsenal will lose fans now
I'm glad that his phone is not damaged
Trust the process. We will go far next season like Liverpool
Stan is going to move the Arsenal franchise to the U.S.A. Arsenal Raiders anyone😂😂😂
Was he crying at the end? Awww 🤣🤣🤣
i may not agree with DT on everything, but he is a true fan. as are all of us that stick with this dreadful club
Depression depression depression!! Arsenal fines right now, DT deserves all he gets, no pity
Hahaha, now he’s changing his tune. Like clockwork.
Truth is, most of these players we are discussing where all reported to be leaving the club in the last transfer window. How they are still here baffles me. It shows the football world doesn't want them and don't think they are good.
"ITS TIMEE TO GOOOO"
This game tho, look at the facts, away from home at an inform Everton side with half the spine and goal scorer missing, did anyone really expect to win
Arteta is trying to rule like pep but Arsenal dont have the funds like Man City to finance replacing players he falls out with. He also does not have the reputation to be given time. Any manager that comes in has to get the players on his side... not throw them under the bus.. not have tantrums when they lose... Then take the time to replace the weak links... its a rebuild job. Klopp took 18 months to get a team that could challenge and it still took a few big signings. Arsenal will need to follow the same route.
Imo AFC lost the plot when we let Emi Martinez go after AMAZING performances for a club where he came through the system & got dropped for a named signing. The message of hard work, patience & performance was sacrificed for a signed name. I have nothing agains Leno, but management made an error. The morale & spirit of the team was stripped from them on a motivational level.  Sad to see our team struggle so much!
First question answer is no its yhe playersnothe managers
Lol... Chelsea gave willian to you guys to get Arsenal relegated 😂😂😂
so so sad. never seen dt so down.... YNWA
Funny club, it's ridiculous, they felt they've arrived after winning united by a lucky penalty... 😂
Before we jump into all these arguments, we need to understand the logic of management. So, if you start to being emotional, and so on that would not bring any success. Look at how Spurs, Liverpool, ManC manage the club. Coming from Die Hard Arsenal Fan.
Is DT stupid? rip half their contracts in Jan? you do realise jan transfer window is hard to buy and sell players as it is halfway in the season? why does he think it is so easy to sell and buy players in jan lol. besides, in our current predicament who the fk would wanna join arsenal, even with arteta at the helm?
Dt wanted Arsene out.. he's been backing arteta for how long.. his idea of a good manager is scary. It's assholes like this that we are where we are. Wenger played a beautiful game.
LOL These clowns getting nothing less than they deserve for getting Wenger sacked. Hoping they relegated.
DT is a hypocrite.
DT is deluded,  Arteta Out!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's taking man u a long time to get over fergie same with arsenal and Wenger. These 2 managers left a huge legacy behind them which takes an exceptional manager to get to grips with. Who's next is the question
Willian is just not used to playing in a team that’s fighting to stay up in the Premier League
finally some sense 😊 that is why i stopped being excited about signings, we are not 2-3 short, we are 11 short!! and we need to get kroenke out
It is the hope that kills you with when you support a team! Arsenal fans seem to have lost hope, that is why the anger has gone, and it is replaced by acceptance.
Willian has had one shot on target this season 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ah yes the tactical genius Arteta who "broke Klopp" is sitting 15th I hear?
even if they sack the manager, they cannot realistically clear the team out. I don't think any manager is gonna last 2 - 4 transfer windows at Arsenal at this rate lol. If they sack Arteta, then they're back to square one and then the new manager will need 2 - 4 transfer windows to properly sort the team out. It's a vicious cycle. But Arsenal is a club that can do better than Arteta.
DT IS BROKEN!!! It's a sad sight.
Looking forward to reading wengers book, even if I already know he didn’t say too much about the problems. Wenger knows the real reason behind this mess. Funny how fans that wanted Wenger  out would love him back right now. Sad times to be an arsenal fan. I hope Arteta can get us out this mess but I think his time is very short and running out
Am really disappointed with what's happening at arsenal,we are really in a big trouble....Big up mr DT
DT is oddly calm today. He's hurt and this time it's deep
ÖZIL>ARSENAL
Recruitment is not the problem . problem is couch clue less person by the way  Lucas ganduzi santi still playing better football in other league and defence holding  Luiz Pablo mari saliba these players are not able to play top league.
The reason DT has lost for words is because all the reasons he used to come up for Arteta defence were missing in the game ie Bellerin and Xhaka The Willian and Eddie decision was all Arteta and it backfired and it shows what a fraud Arteta is
watching arsenal like this, week in week out make me hate football..
Dr, that's wrong. The Swiss ramble had reported that Kroneke has spent $0 on Arsenal in the last 5 years in 2018.
Flip flop 😂😂
Brighton v arsenal on the 29th has now become a 6pointer relegation battle. Who would have thought that at the beginning of the season...
It I know bad at taking any criticism even though you will scream in a mans face to get out of arsenal, you have all brought this in yourselves wid your wenger out pagan behaviour 🙄 then you wanna sack everyone. No one will want to manage or come to your club
I’m calling it u guys are getting relegated cuz y’all trash asf 😂😂
I am a Barca fan and I believe Arsenal need to hire  Allegri .  Just go and get him.
Wenger back make Arteta assistant I say...
Love DTs Jacket
Come join the rats army DT 😂 come home *LeeGunnerVoice*
January signings are just bandage purchases..they wouldn't treat the wounds.
"This phone has passed the DT test. Certified to be 100% bomb proof"
As a non arsenal fan I do have to agree with most of the things DT has said. Not sure if Arteta is the guy but let him get the deadwood out and get his own squad together and then judge him  Look at klopp
When everyone thought AFTV would struggle after wenger’s sacking.....
Why don’t you all cheer up ? Go down to the club shop and buy everything in sight!
Where's the Banner DT??? We were Never this poor in Wenger's Worst season!!!.🥳..4kn Egoist....Mikel's position is Non-negotiable!!!
I love taking a swing at your thoughts and what you say DT, but I don’t think you’re a bad person. You’re just a super passionate lad about his football team. Most people are. Poor Gunners though.
Good ebening gooners 😂
When its gonna end, Robbie - DT
12.01 to fair Robbie wasn't happy in the summer at just getitn partey. He always said we needed more.
Regarding Ozil, yes there is a contract in place duh lol
DT is dejected
DT once said- the best chance of us getting into top 4 is that Chelsea and Manchester United don't sack Lampard and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Arteta In.
arsenal don't have that quality, arteta can't do anything.
Arsenal are losers if MU or Chelsea were in this situation they would sack the manager. That's the hard reality
All i want to hear is, Arteta is sacked.
Xd
dt doesn't know anything about football, this clown backed arteta hahahaha
17 minutes?!
This is Arsenal afc 🤣🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😄😄😄😄
Arsenal will continue to be in trouble untill it get rid of the championship players .how on Earth can Nketia start any match , He cannot even be on the first 11 of Sheffield United, check Rob Holding, Joe will those r championship players not even premier League.
DT must be a acronym for Deluded Twat
Arsene Wenger did say that he is going to let people find out how difficult the job is.
At the end of the day the game is won and lost in the midfield and with no creative midfielder how the fowards going to get assists
DT - Are you still 110% Arteta??? You Deluded man..
Why would willian care for the club when he comes from a rival club
Keep your head up DT this club will come back I really think someone like Rafa could do a job with these players, I wanted ancelotti.
You wanted change. Top 4 wasn’t good enough remember that? Remember any manager would make us champions?  How’s that worked out.
This is like YT heroin
Hold on. Willian > Ziyech right Robbie?
Anyone else watch Robbie's eyebrows when DT talks?
Imagine DT going to Apple care for the phone and they go.... ( finish the sentence)
At this point DT FC would easily beat Arsenal !!!!!
David luiz is leaving at the end of this season that's why he is not the captain, it's a matter of consistency
BIG UP DT
Lmfaooo they all said wenger out! Brought out the banners, congratulations you played yourself.
Arteta IN
And January ain’t gonna smooth and easy to get new players in. I see it happening more in the summer meaning we’re in trouble.
Frank lampard brought quality players and they are doing well Arteta should bring in 4 or five players
We can't buy anyone, who wants to come to Arsenal
Arsene Wenger said you know more about the club after l leave
Stop blaming Kroenke. You won the FA Cup no criticism of Kroenke. Nketiah and Willock are nothing but boys. Send them out on loan or to work in McDonald's. Arsenal need men. Serious men. I was critical of Arteta being made manager, wrong choice. Arsenal are sinking big time. Change the manager before it's too late.
Who recruited Willian in the first place?? Who keeps playing him every week?? Who reloaned dud and frankly speaking a total nincompoop Ceballos?? Who kept and keeps playing xhaka? Who kept bellerin? Who kept lacazette? All fingers point to Arteta. He is not good enough to coach and manage arsenal. Get rid of him and appoint Allegri.
It doesn’t matter how many managers Arsenal get. If the club aren’t spending as much as other clubs for top players to improve the squad, it’s limited how much change they will have. I don’t like Arsenal tho so it makes me happy lol.
Now this makes sense, DT good interview.
Arteta in 1 season won more than Klopp did in 4
15:52 Here we go. DT finally succumbed.
You got to feel for DT: At the end of interview he is almost about to cry.
You all been screaming laca not start.. Dt stop confusing us
Arsenal is like  Chelsea now. Players lacks fighting spirit. Lampard and Arteta have no confidence and doesn't show motivation to the players
Well Arsenal won the Fa and the community shield...and the fans were singing another song about Arteta...What went wrong?
Name of football club:Arsenal Players:some are of wycombe FC
DT change in a span of  1 week
Lads I’ve been a fan my whole life but I have to say this. If burnley somehow get results against United and wolves, Brighton beat Sheffield, and we slip up against Chelsea and Brighton, we could go into the bottom 3 within the next 2 match days
As a true football fan, arsenal need to stick with Arteta for at least 1 more season. He gives so many people across the whole country so much joy, laughter and happiness.
it is the biggest fan channel in the world with most subscription and it's absolutely banter club 😂
That be careful what you wish for if Wenger goes is suddenly looking true
This just goes to show the greatness of Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson. They left some big shoes to be filled.
DT is an Arsenal man!
Correct me so if arsenal got relegated but won the europa league(even tho they wont win) they gonna play championship and champions league??? 😂😂😂
look at how they’ve accepted their fate. It’s not even funny anymore
Looks like robbies Mrs wants a new bathroom
Why is DT starting over MOH?
how could you be so depressed, you guys just won FA cup last season
look at the yellow strip on this video,. robbie really milking the situation,. the audacity.,
What’s wrong with starting the young players. Letting go of a young player with a tremendous potential is a huge mistake. Gnabry is a fine example.
horrible subs. crap starting 11. i know we dont have a title winning team or maybe even a top 4 team. but our team isnt bad enough to be where we are. arteta has to GO! Arteta out!
The only way to keep Arsenal at the top The only solution is a manager to do this Arsene Wenger who never return to us. So after all this, we have to Support & keep  Mikel Arteta without pressure even if he lost too many Games but I know how much talent, an ability he has so let him do his job by the freedom & let start to create a new big couch like Arsene Wenger I know Mikel can be with the potential he has. I think Mikel Arteta is the right manager for Arsenal let him keep until January you gone see change 💯✔ ⚪🔴
DT is a mug. Talks out of arse and ain't got a clue about the beautiful game
Balogan is far better than Nketiah
Nketiah is very overrated he's not upto Arsenal standards
Etoro out
Carlo Ancelotti has more Champions Leagues than Mikel Arteta has seasons in management.
DT repping the new merch while saying that the fan base needs to oust Kroenke 🤦🏼‍♂️ stop funding him then
I understand how DT must be feeling.... Shame that club like ARSENAL going through times like this .... ❤️from Liverpool fan
"Wenger back in" 😆
Arteta ➡️ OUT Allegri ⬅️ IN
its always the same thing...yall keep saying "they showed passion in 2nd half".....WHY DO U HAVE TO WAIT FOR T HE 2ND STAFF JUST PLAY WITH PASSION FROM THE BEGINNING COME ON MAANNNN...
We are gathered here once again to drink the tears of Arsenal fans.
All i see is Willian slander mate don't blame Willian blame your manager for buying him in the first place and giving him a 3 year deal he's 32 years he's best days are past him what did u expect?
Gary Neville: “Be careful what you wish for”... Spot on.
Their greatest ever manager was fired because of this lot. They need to own up to that.
Told you guys about Willian before he signed, he's only here for the paycheck and because he wants to live in London. Everyone involved in his signing needs to be fired immediately.
Just sell this club to arabs and everything will be fine once again. Good luck my past
We need Wenger to come back help arteta
A bit naive - “Can we have their contracts ripped up?”  Bit of a clue their DT. “Contract”. No player or agent is in such a weak negotiating position that they will allow the club a one way cancellation clause.  Or a clause where they can sell a player without that players agreement.     I think that’s part of the rot that has been spoken about - and I imagine it’s part of the disease in the Man Utd team too; you pay a player x hundreds of thousands a week - whatever their performance, whether they play or not.   Win bonuses make little difference to these multi-millionaire players- so if they are not motivated by personal pride or a personal love for the club colours they are playing in - the rot really does set in.  Too many millionaire mercenaries that don’t care enough.  Having a team of players that love their club and are completely committed to the cause is the real challenge for Arteta or any future manager of Arsenal, or of Man U IMHO.
You people said nkeita should start then he did
By the 20th game, we will be the ones calling for Big Sam if Arteta doesnt go right now!
This guy is embarrassing himself on a weekly bases.  An absolute joke
Appoint ranieri “survive this year and win the league the next” 😂 Leicester underdog story x2
"Robbie, let me dash my phone. I'll pay for whatever I break".
Embarrassing change is needed arteta out not good enough
dat phone was a banter LG.
Edu and Arteta must go. Since their  involvement, the club became small and disaster. Get rid of them please.
Willian is already enjoying his retirement, an ex-Chelsea player who won't give a flying f*ck if the club goes down; his only concern would be a potential drop in wages. Terrible piece of recruitment.
Arsenal has Ozil.
Y'all deserve this for treating Ozil like that
Regardless if the core is rotten, the manager isn't on levels. It's like saying you've got a staph infection and a gash over your eye... let's not stitch the wound because we don't have antibiotics for the real problem... it's dumb. Liverpool never spent and showed real leadership from the board until a manager showed immense potential and it looked like... wait a minute if we go big, he can take us to the very top... the same could be done at Arsenal over the next 3-4 years if their manager does well enough.
ozil can't make the squad for footballing reasons- this should tell you if the manager is serious or not.
The word 'hurtin' is now a humorous word in the context & dictionary  of Arsenal! Arsenal 2.0 my gunners is nothing but a joke!
Arsene Wenger was hounded out by these rubbish fans... Now they dare claim Arsene Wenger was right. Fxxk these fans
I’m a Man U fan we both doin terrible since we lost fergie and wenger facts
Man thinks Arsenal ever had a chance to sign Upamecano
If you follow a club or anything in this world, there will be pain. Only The Lord Jesus Christ can give you peace.
AFTV post match interviews gonna be full blown hour long podcasts by the time this season finishes
I feel you bro
Manager is not arsenal's problem it's the players on the pitch, the same thing with Barcelona. They are just not good enough. The team needs new a change of faces in the dressing room otherwise the same things will keep happening.
To be honest....  I think the goal this season is to avoid relegation.  It pains me to accept this harsh reality but it is what it is...  I think Arteta won't be sacked... They will give him upto February latest..  I also think...  That January and the summer window will be pivotal as to what Arsenal want to achieve going forward.
Like what I've said, arteta is a piece in the bigger picture. We need to get Vinai and Edu out and bring Ralf ragnick in. That's the only way this club can be saved.
Dt called willian a sponge headed motherf@$ka during the live watch along. Does aftv have anything to say about it. No
If you’re going to chose Eddie over Laca you’re also going to pick Willock over Ozil, and Elneny over Guendouzi.... one man making all those decisions
Hello, Wenger out brigades. Enjoy your karma.
Just say it DT you backed the wrong man and abused anyone with differing opinions 😅Arteta wouldn't get a job as a PE TEACHER
Arsenal is a bad manager. The problem is the midfield. There is no disease. Get two creative midfielders (natural dribblers) and a tall striker in the mound of Giroud otherwise
LUTON 2-1 ARSENAL - next season
Dt is a chief aftv should ban him throwing his toys out the pram like a spolt brat 😒 the guys a clown he should be booted off the channel his attitude stinks Robbie jus gives him a  bly kmt
We won't be relegated 😂😂😂that is for sure...  The whole squad needs to be overhauled as soon as possible
Atleast they are consistent in dissapointing fans! We might be competing for 4th place in 3 years not champions league. Forget it!
Arteta is choosing players based of their attitude not performance. He thinks strong words and passion in training will translate to performance on the pitch. Not with these players. They are playing the manager.
Change willian.
DT threw his phone trying to kill a RAT no doubt.....smh.
Change the players, how many times can this club fire a manager? It's the players, they suck too.
DT YOUR AN ABSOLUTE WASTEGASH
He says good screen protector, but Robbie, when phone is shown to him, just laughs. I think it is safe to say, taht screen is destroyed.
The manager OMG... Mikel Arteta is making things hard for himself
It's a sad day to see arsenal fall so far was a laugh and a joke but now there are seriously looking like fighting to stay up and could become the new leeds a massive club that went down and took 10 plus years to come back
Why is this man still talking about Bellerin. He was not in the team as you wished and we lost. How many crosses came from the right side? Stop thinking with your emotions.
Why is willian starting matches. He’s not doing anything at all. The club need to give an official explanation. Also why r we not counter attacking... The playing style is manager’s fault
give wenger this arsenal team..he’ll end up top 10 easily..but i prefer arteta..because its fun to watch aftv..
I don't know why Arteta is so obsessed with Nketiah. The kid is a Jeffers clone!  No footballing skills under his sleeves to show off and be proud of. He is no RVP. He is tiny, can't head, can't dribble, can't shoot and yet Arteta always prefers him over Laca. WHY??? Got a golden opportunity to score against Everton and he shot the ball wayward. He should be playing U21 not the first regular team.
What can everyone understand clearly now is that the problem wasn't Emery, nor Arteta. The problem are the players. Lack of desire, lack of mentality.  Holding isn't good enough, his passing ability is very poor.
LOL I CAN’T BELIEVE ROBBIE TAKES DISRESPECT JUST FOR VIEWS 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Arsenal is a small football club now
Remove dt from aftv
It's Karma DT!! Don't call people rats just because they don't sing your song!! 😏😏😏
Arteta is biased ana has an agenda against some players. Correct me if im wrong
I respect this DT 💯 for owning up his support. One Luv bruv respect 🙌
Maybe DT should sack himself. Thats a better option
DT as much as most of us liked Arteta, i wouldnt be surprised  when we wake up tomorrow and Arteta is jobless.  Ironically, the problem is with sub-human brain players like lacazette, nketiah, Saka, niles, and willian.
ArtetaBALL!
Wait until you get relegated is when you'll realize we need a new coach
guendouzi saliba and and ozil are laughing at them
Only reason why William left us for you guys is because we wouldn’t pay his requested wages and you guys paid the bill and now he doesn’t care.
Kroenke's motto : MAGA Make Arsenal Ghastly Again (and again and again and again)
This guy is absolutely deluded. Arsenal are sitting at 15 and still he wants Arteta to be in charge. How deluded can you be?
get sam allardyce were in trouble
It's time to go!
Arteta 1000% out sorry he cant even coach under 13 boys
I blame people like dt for this
Only true Arsenal fans who can't see our club go down like this will call for "Arteta out" or even "Kroenke out".  What's the use of winning 2/3 games after losing consecutive 10/15 games? It will not mean that Arsenal is back. We see a very bad defensive tactic and it's not changing which means the manager should be changed. I think, if Arteta has to stay then he needs to bring Ozil back and and take off some players like Willian .
Robbie getting married and starts his speech  “Thank you all for being here, Got to ask everyone here the same question, is Arteta out of his depths?”
Jose could fix arsenal I’m telling u right now
Wenger was never the problem. It was the owners. Emery and Arteta did start their managerial careers at the Arsenal rather well. But they weren't backed by the board. I hope we get relegated and then let's hope someone will buy us out and save us from Kroenkes.🙏🙏🙏
imagine being an arsenal fan right now reminscing about finishing 4th and getting raped in the champions league by bayern every season and remembering that as the good times 😂
Ruined Pepe and partey. Need to get ole in at arsenal
Robbie keep saying change the manager. Who would come to this club? As long as the kroanke's are still at this club, the only kind of managers Arsenal can nring is the likes of Arteta or Emrey or promote from the B team coach. Always budget restricted manager and this can only takes thus far.
Use to look forward to dt crying, where is the passion in these vids. Getting boring now.
The scariest thing is a season after the next season arsenal might be still in the Championship
Wenger signed players like auba, laca, Ozil. There were full of praises on these players under Wenger when we were winning. Yet there are haters that accuse Wenger started all the bad run due to bad players. Let me ask this. Is it due to bad recruit when we bought these players OR was it due to subsequent managers poor management of these players?
Speak about dragging a interview out kmt
Arteta ouuuuttt bloooooddd
Nah Bro, YOU still get excited over 1 signing.....
Boris has undermined Arsenal's plans to buy 2 for the price of 1.  That is to have their Christmas party and 'End of season' party at the same time.
There's nothing wrong as fans in backing your manager. Banter aside, I genuinely feel bad for some of the Arsenal fans man.
KROENKES OUT!!
Arteta tactic are so deep that even he himself cant understand
We need Ozil and the likes! We need to buy! Not only Artetas fault only it many included here pls. From begining Kronke needs to GO! Arteta has not many players to choose pls! Am hurting man like DT!😭
You know what ye. At least DT says it how it is. I love to laugh at him when things are going against Arsenal but respect to him for keeping it real
Wenger out blud
DT Might Land Up In ICU Very Soon, Get Well Soon 😂
The Board and owners are laughing. That's what they wanted. It's good for the fans to attack the coach and the team. But not them. We can get many scape goats for the fans to attack but must leave us alone, we are not to blame. The jerseys are selling well and we can buy more scape goats for the fans .
Oh shut up, get this child outta here hahaha
Wait, did Dt agree with Turkish 🤔🤔
It is an embarrassment. The worst team ever Arsenal had. Horrible
As a non Arsenal fan (I won't lie, I hate you. I'm a Pompey fan and you cheated against us in your unbeaten season), DT does annoyingly speak a lot of sense, but he needs to calm down and not take things personally.
My suggestion is, the club need to get another manager with enough experience the liked of Algeri,fr example we can see how Everton are performing right now ,coz the board dont know how to plan well if u employ an experienced manager u must back him with experience quality players the likes of Chelsea.
Peps ball boy
Even as a Chelsea fan I feel sad when I see these two guys depressed and without any positive energy. All the best and hope for better times for your team so our rivalry becomes such exciting again.
Honestly respect to dt for admitting he was wrong in arteta
Everyone’s playing Monday morning quarterback with lineups. If Laca started, they’d say why didn’t Nketia or Auba start as the 9.   Either way Arteta and the BOARD have to go
DT talking sense in calm way
He has average players. What he can do with them ?? Nothing.. Arsenal will play well once they are sold
DT man... So hard to say Arteta out
Funny guy has motto says Behave xD!!!! Lol lol lol lol
'I hope Brighton get relegated.' 😂😂😂
Is his phone a classic Nokia? It survived a hell of a beating.
Kronke didn’t spend enough to male us Premier League champions , but he spent enough to at least challenge. Don’t blame him , you wanted reinforcements, he got you what you needed
Arsene FC
don robbie getting that brand deal while arsenal are garbage. absolute genius
Suprsingly Dt is the only guy talking sense
Why does DTs mic look like he just shoved it right up somewhere.
AFTV is to blame. They started with Wenger Out, Mustafi Out, Ozil Out, Xhaka Out followed by Emery Out and now Arteta Out. They keep point finger to an individual either player or manager everytime we lose. The person to be blame should be the whole squad not an individual. Pointing to an individual make thing even worse. Now everything gone wrong. We have become the joke. I'm not surprise if we relegated to Championship next season. History remain history but no player or manager want to come to Arsenal in future.
😂😂Liverpool fan😂😂
Why is there a Nike tick on DT's collar, i thought Arsenal is sponsored by Adidas
It's time Us fans raised our voice. Usmanov left because of the rot from the top, look where he is now. Everton have proper structure. I still think he's a true Arsenal fan, ask him maybe. It's time we acted; we cost his position and Reality as said has come back to bite.  Managers are dispensable yes, but it's time we all stepped up and got rid of Kr0enkevirus once and for all
Enemy of progress lol
DT decked out in the latest clobber from the club shop. Absolute Christmas tree of a fan
The leader isn’t playing because of the man at the top he’s got to GO GRONKY
The disease is the owner. Nothing is gonna change. It's ground hog day. Someone needs to come up with a way to put pressure on him or we getting relegated sooner or later if he stays around thats for certain
I like the reflection dt
seems old wenger was not so bad after all.
Willian's workrate at Chelsea was ridiculously good in his first 2 seasons especially. Maybe he's just less hungry now because he's 32 and he's won stuff.
Isis fam u get me
Willian and David Luiz have completed their mission of sabotage now it’s time for the final blow. Put arsenal in the championship!!!🥳🥳🤪🔥
Joker of the century dt🤣🤣🤣Haha we need to deal with our worst time that we gave them our best player and he reject us to join them😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Player ratings coming out next morning? Just... Take your time with it.
A True fan wears his heart on his sleeve. Respect DT jus wants the best for this club.
Good to see a bit of humility DT, you lost a lot of credibility with fans by supporting Arteta despite his failure before...
Ty: Give Arteta till March to turn things around. After that let's keep him anyway because we will need his experience to challenge for the Championship.
If that continues, AFTV will have 2 million subs at the end of the year.  Robbie will then be  called   'Sir Don Robbie'
spurs fighting liverpool for the title  !! arseanal fighting to stay in premier league  !! its christmas everyday !!!!
Lacazette? Play Balogun.
Wenger and ozil having a tea session
wenger : hohohohohoh ozil : some popcorn sir ?
Therefore no excuses enough for Arteta to keep his job, everyday same speech,, “ we have dominated the game we have created a chance “. Arteta-Out
So shite 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
feel you DT, thats wobbie thing to be wrong
really upamecano....lots of top team targeting him, and this fool say upamecano want to join arsenal.  You have saliba an actual good young defender  your manager cannot handle him, its time for Arteta to go please be realistic
Bring back Ozil
If I’m wrong I’m wrong if I’m right I’m right wow what a philosopher DT is
Somebody, make a video of DT rubbing his face in his interviews.
What does dt think is gonna happen in January exactly??? 🤔🤔. Guy keeps talking about January like they're gonna make a brand new team or something. 🙄
I just wish DT would do another freestyle for us
Everton are better than Arsenal in every position.
Hahahaha your going down gooners
Wenger out fam
At least we didn’t get a red card
🤣😢🤣
Gotta give everton credit. They were way better than arsenal.
£72m on Pepe, £42m on Partey and £m’s on people like Gabi etc... and some of these fans want to moan about their club not being backed??  Go talk to Southampton and the likes of Crystal Palace about backing .... nonsense
We bought Pepe but the manger wanted Zaha ,says it all
Smhhh just let Arsenal at relegation
Arsenal have really fucked it now after missing out on Big Sam to save them from relegation
This DT is not too smart. No offense, DT.
Arsenal treated wenger so badly, the supporters verbally abused him.  You all got what you wanted 'wenger out', let the consequence seap into your veins.
But we called Partey the new vieira 🤔🤔
Hope we lose next 5 games so this clown manager can be sacked
This is what happens when you treat Ozil badly...
We now could only score from penalty. Couldn’t score, the bigger problem then you can’t defense.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal is a mess. DT learn something from mark about How to UNDERSTAND football. Your club is completely mess Not artet
If they lose to maupay and welbeck ty: welbeck your a cheat and i hope brighton get relegated
The disease in there is Stan ... Wenger was holding for this time not to happen.
The amount of mid rolls😭
Laughing stock
You shouldn’t have hounded out Wenger then.
Starting to feel bad now.
But Arteta broke Klopp
Who gives a crap if Ozil doesn't track back. Arsenal need goals. Put this guy back in, unless the board won't let him play due to China.
Now i see ty videos i just pull it down he is  just  too delusional with positivity how can  he  back the manager after this
No Xhaka, No Bellerin. So blame Willian. Dont blame the crap defending from set pieces. Dont blame the defender who doesnt mark Calwert-Lewin. Blame 1 player.
Lost every game in december... Robbie we drew southhamton
Wenger aaau club bachau!!!!!
I’m glad DT now watches the TV and says things  how it is.. Thumbs up man!!!
We need manager with people skills
Now you see you should have not forced wenger out
Even though arsenal are 15th, we still needed to get rid of Wegner. His tactics were dead, he had to too much power at the club and he clearly was not the right person to take us to where we want to be. At this point it doesn't look like Arteta is that man either
I will not be buying Etoro or any other Gambling rubbish your selling Robbie.
Allegri now!
DT annoyed with the club bit still goes straight out to buy the new tracksuit...🙄
"you cannot stroll around the pitch"...unless your name is firmino, and you score 2 strolling
Robbie preparing a new league championship channel.
Wasn't so bad with Wenger now was it 😂😂
5 pounds donation to break 1000pounds ph
'We all make mistakes" of course we all make mistakes but m8 u have a LONG way to go to see the bigger picture why coz of that Adidas top that's one of few of u not looking at the bigger picture
DT is the very definition of the word "manchild".
Good defenders become bad after joining Arsenal because they're not well tested at training by strong and good strikers. There's a reason Holding has not improved.
Tbf he was fairly humble of his previous opinions
Holdings not been good enough, he never has been good enough, he’s a championship player.
Arsenal could of had Ancellotti, Rodgers, Mourinho etc since Wenger went... sadly alot of 'snobby' Arsenal fans didn't want them at the time... well done 👍
5years later   arsenal v dt fc
robbie i’m not going to trade with etoro
Bring back arsene wenger.
Are you still Arteta in DT?
Extending Aubameyang's contract was a mistake they will regret. Don't be decieced by the occasional goals he will score. The premiership gets better and tougher, Aubameyang lacks the physical attributes required in the league.
"Arteta is better than Ole"-DT 2019
we are all hurting , but lets get real Arteta looks out of his depth, Hope i,m wronge but i dont think i am
Relegation incoming 🤣🤣
Loss loss loss loss loss loss loss looool
damn i hope predicted the arteta out ever since arsenal on their high horse after the fa cup final damn this is funny
DT has proved what a deluded fool he is for backing a manager too much! Rat army 🐀
My question is do the players respect Arteta? Seems as though he has lost their trust.
January window can't help much. I would really want to change Arteta but there is no better option now
was it worth it winning man utd? WHUHAHAHAHAHA
He's a coach not a proper manager!!!!!!
Idiots are with arteta!
You can't blame youngsters when they don't capitalize on a single chance....anybody can miss it....Laca and Auba have underperformed...so why blame the youngsters !!!
Dt changes colour like a chameleon😂 mid-week
Keep buying new Arsenal merch like that jacket DT, more $ for Kroenke 😅😅😅
Tbh Relegation could be a good thing. Srart from scratch out of the PL limelight
No Xhaka and bellerin to blame today
The same man who had a banner saying Arsene thank you for the memories but it’s time to say goodbye, enjoy the memories cause that’s all you’ve got now
I'm a Chelsea fan.  Luiz and Willian, on their day, are good players - especially Willian.  But the fact remains, you shouldn't be buying players like that aged over 30.  A world class striker maybe, and we have a 36 year old defender - but you're buying players from other PL clubs after they've hit their peak.  In this league, I don't think it's a smart move.
Get rid off him Rodie
I'll say it again, Arteta Out. we need an experienced manager us out of this
I can't stand DT
Arsenal banta fc 😂😂😂😂
DT dont worry mate.......us Arsenal fans respect you a lot. A 100% pure Gunner
These AFTV knobs wanted to make a business out of Arsenal's hardships, and now they're feeling sad?? What loads of bullocks. They're happy from inside. This helps their business.
Willian played well during lockdown so Arsenal can sign him on big wages !   Stat : Willian has 1 shot on target (0 goals) in 12 games....he is a winger !!!
Wenger please come back
Wenger.. Fans you want me out for this...??
Any minute now,,,,,, 5,,,,4,,,,3,,,,2,,,,1,,,,,, POW!!!! PUNCHES THE WALL AND STARTS CRYING
Arsenal in trouble, the quicker they act the more they can salvage.
Will be playing Lincoln city next season..might get a draw....haha.
Spoilt brats back from his naughty corner
Arsenal will win a title next season...the Championship title
mickey mouse owner n manager
17:23
"Let's all laugh at DT, Let's all laugh at DT, a rahrahrah, a rahrahrah" 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Arsenal lost their fear factor ever since wenger left
The job isn’t too big for him cause Arsenal aren’t a BIG club hahahahaha
A wise man once said: "BACK AGAIN"
Arsenal is the same problem of Man Utd bad management from top to bottom
The way Arsenal is going down they will soon discovered oil
Holding is a bottom half defended
Arteta is out of he’s depth he knew what he was taking on and the players he inherited, he’s the manager FULL STOP, it stops and starts with him END OF,stop making excuses for him you sound so delusional , when Maitland niles is your MOM your teams in trouble!!!                         Cancer in a disease Not your football teams form,,,,
We want you to stay! We want you to stay!  MIKEL ARTETA! We want you to stay!
Not even ex great club
Lol im not even surprised at these results anymore. I've lost all hope
Your manager dt, you deserve everything you getting
ahhh poor dickhead
DT really could use for an Anger Management therapy. The man is a walking rage 😁
It starts with defence, it starts with defence. Arteta has some excellent traits but the team is conceding goals that (at this level) should be stopped.
Better players please
It's time for Arteta to ***k off if he still believes Willian can do something for this team. So Arteta do us a favour and ***k off
Abumayang, Lacagoals and will I am are the best players in Arsenal’s history 😍😍😍
Edu out
We change the manager and we go through the whole circle again.
My mum is Arteta In, is she mad?
DT knows what's going on here, other fans should really listen to him because he knows what he's talking about
Tings are very bad bruvvv. Your English mate, not Jamaican.   COYB
Dt makes me happy angry wee man lol
Good on u dt i just wish u didnt get carried away before bc idiots will nevee forget. We learn anyway
DT is a broken man 🤣 look what Arsenal has done to him man
UCL in 3 years. Times ticking
How does this result change DT's opinion on Arteta? Everton are a good team at the moment and we missed our spine; Auba, Partey and Gabriel. Nothing will change until the squad is ripped up. Mikel must be backed regardless of the results imo. I think Brighton is a must win tho
What changed from wed to now that made everyone think we was gonna win
Bring back wenger, and put arteta as assistant. You can't just sack a guy who was given a squad of rubbish, and expect him. To work miracles in less than a year! Yes the job is to big for him, but put him as assistant and bring wenger back to teach him the ways of arsenal! DT is an absolute arrogant mug, should of been kicked off the channel ages ago!
Arteta broke klopp 😂😂😂😂
The club will back Arteta thinking he’ll win the Europa league but he’ll lose the final
Ha ....Ha, get a proper manager instead of ex players. You deserved where you are now, this is Arsenal no time for sentimental reasons. Players don't trust unknown manager to lead them through thick and thin. Anyway stick with Arteta while every opposition pass you by ...........................
If I live in North London I will go to Emirates stadium bring the banner ask the revolution right now. I hope some people will join.
This is one top class idiot
AFTV having better storylines than WWE
Even emery was better
XD
this  is relegation form and if you guys don't wake up n  sack art a big real  chance of you guys going down. Yeah he needed time but this squad is good enough to be in top 10 and it hasnt worked. Remember when Leeds went down so better act now. i dont advocate manager not getting enough time but this is just unacceptable and action must taken fast fast fast
See I would say wait for January but how far will arsenal fall by the time the window opens 🤦🏾‍♂️
DT is becoming like TY where he is creating his own reality and doesn't wanna face reality because what's happening to Arsenal is so difficult to accept.
We are still the arsenal. Store this energy and don't let it get corrupted
Remember "Arteta broke Klopp" I think the truth is Arteta broke DT
Dts phone is tougher and more resilient than arsenals whole back 4
We will never know if mikel is the right manager if we sack him now. Give him the transfer window then 3 months after see where we are. Then you we can say if he is the right one.
Arteta in 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I'm almost begging arsenal to win nowadays I don't think I can eat anymore popcorn
Wenger is too classy, and humble to wish arsenal ill fortune in its current situation.  Which makes the whole situation even more bitter
DT has finally seen the light. Finally.
Well I know you should never say "too good to go down" about any team, but surely somethings gotta give at Arsenal FC heyy
It isnt the point of who is to blame everything with arsenal is to blame we know this. But arteta was and is not the best choice for a manager.
One thing I’ll never understand about arsenal is,  a couple years back they had a shortage of big name players so they played with a  bunch of young inexperienced players.. so they spent big and brought in brilliant, big name players. But put those names on the bench and continue to play the young and inexperienced??
DT::Cost your manager stop cussing the players
We love watching you hurt. Like really really love it
You had a manager who gave you lot 4th place every year. Now you got what you wish for
"When's it gonna end Wobbie?!"
This guy is a little kid man
As a man utd fan I would personally take Arteta > Ole at our club🤷‍♂️
DT went out, got some fresh air, lit a bud and mellowed out ya understand fam
phat loss jelly on my belly
Arsenal are gunna need to call Sam allardyce in at the end of the season
DT calmed down after his hissy fit when the game ended. They call it passion. I call it good tv. A great actor at work. Arsenal have to go through rough waters to get back again. There is no quick fix. Time is what a manager needs. Unfortunately fans want instant results. Patience is a virtue. But Arsenal fans have none. A new manager would come in and do the do well and then have a dip, and then everyone turns on him.
Back Arteta! We need a huge clean out and 3-4 midfield players! Nothing will change sacking Arteta.
I think the should bring back Wenger as manger and put arteta as assistant
17 mid roles lmfai
Wenger in 😂😂😂
Remember when they were hyping up Willian, guy has 1 shot on target in 11 games 🤣😭🤣😭🤣
We bullied them ...yeah right ....mugged ya off
Mikitarian is playing well tbf he’s doing really well at Roma
The best thing to happen to us is relegation.
Course u can’t rip up the contract, u agreed to pay him. Either buy him out or continue giving Ozil 300k a week.
DT was giving off about the club and bringing out new merchandise. There he is wearing it 😳😂
Swear you lot wanted lacazette out the team and we’re cussing him every game, now you’re crying that nketiah played ahead of him... make up your mind
Should have got Big Sam in before he went to West Brom 🤣🤣🤣
Why did DT not seem sober this video? Also William was decent second half
Tier 4 ......   2 metres ?
Mind the League
I was never on the wenger out brigade  !! Careful what you wish for i said and now walla !! We r fooked
we want you to stay mikel arteta we want you to stay
That's one of the best and most honest interviews of DT on this platform.
Arteta needs to go... ! Been a fan since 1986. Never have I seen our team in this position, it’s a laughing stock...
DT I can repair your phone. DM me @phonesurgeon_cdf
Do these man seriously think people like upamecano and konate that are at Leipzig who are going to play knockout football against Liverpool in the champions league round of 16 to join arsenal who are in a relegation battle? Most importantly, do they think clubs will want the players who are shite?
220k a week, 3 year contract for a 32 year old who was never that good to begin with.  Is Willian the worst transfer ever?
Arteta has the nerve to say we dominated the game
He's a rubbish coach.. it's so confusing why all these fans are looking at other issues. Football is a dynamic game and so is it's management. We have a decent team. He starts with so much fear and plays a low block for no reason.
Fair play DT. You're a true supporter.
It takes a big man to admit being wrong D.T....I doft my cap to you for that..We all need to come together for the sake of this club and get rid of everything that's wrong.Otherwise we will be hurting more for a lot longer.
KRONKIE OUT NOW!
Yeah nah. Arteta out Y'wallad!
Quick question lads: how come you go to the trouble of making the seats socially distant in the watch along stream, but stand 0.5 metres from each other for 20 mins in these videos? 😂
get the bag don robbie
Fair play to DT there, that’s the most reasonable I’ve ever heard him... pretty fair analysis of everything (for once)
Wow DT is broken. "I'm only human".
Yep your useless - don’t want to hear a word against ole ever
There is this interesting video - where a village saw a huge monster struggling to stand straight on the mountain nearby . There were a few pebbles falling at times towards them, and the villagers thought its the monster that is being mischievous. They started shooting arrows towards the monster day in and day out. The monster still persisted, but one fine day after getting non stop arrows on his body, he gave up and stood aside. A huge Boulder came down to finish off the village. He was only saving the village from obliteration all this while. Is arsene Wenger similar to the monster? [Man Utd Fan & Big Football fan]
It’s to funny this man stop it 😂 sack arteta get in Eddie Howe
Dt had the same throwing lessons as bellerin
Calmed down DT is a lesser entertaining one. Robbie should start interviewing DT during the game itself when Arsenal concedes. Thrown phones into the camera and all that!
I know it might be Artetas fault to a certain degree, but the only way we will get out this mess if we use Arteta as our messenger to go after the board. After some of the comments, he's made he clearly feels the same as us, no manager can take over right now. Working with the board is like building a sandcastle next to the tide, you can only build so much until they tear it down. If we all just back Mikel and out all our faith in him, give him the confidence to rip players out the squad. Just a thought tbh
DT’s out here comparing everything happening to Arsenal with the Cornavirus 😂😂
Im a LFC fan u wont probably respond but imagin that u could hav got Klopp before he joined us think about that
DT IS A SELL OUT
an L is better than nothing
Bellerin says he's seen 8 year olds do better phone throws than DT
I started watching AFTV because of DT - when he's not angry he talks a lot of sense
From a Celtic fan, if Arteta goes, Arsenal have to go for Brendan Rodgers
DT, shouldn't watch Chelsea vs Arsenal game because that game is gonna be a death sentence.
Keep Ozil’s name out of your mouth DT! How is he part of the disease 🦠? Howwww!!! You have a potential player who can get us out of this craziness but you take him out because of politics! Tell me DT, are you telling me Ozil won’t malt out on this team? Come on..
no more watch alongs with this many people for the time being
his phone is obviously fucked, the way Robbie laughs at it when DT pulls it out lol and conveniently holds it in a way the camera can't see the screen
Holding couldn't have been much tighter
That Arsenal alt kit that looks like it's covered in blood is so fitting for this season....
We need to get the Kroenkes out. They aren’t football people. How do we get them out? Don’t go to matches after lockdown, don’t buy tickets nor souvenirs. Starve them of funds and I believe they’ll leave.
DT always overlooked how lucky they were in the final, incorrect red and the oppositions best player being injured.. yes he did well to win but he hung everything on that win.. lucky and now it is showing horrifically for him 😂😂😂
Alan Pardew is available....
I wouldn't mind Eddie Howe getting the job
i don't even know who enketya is but here i am at 3am binging aftv after a defeat.. unmisslable drama🍿
DT should get an old Nokia in future, just in case.
Why Dt is not Trusting the process ....🤔Hmmm
There's no doubt that Arteta needs time to rebuild and obviously it's a massive project. But even during the course of that project, the manager has to be getting some results. 15th is unacceptable and the fact that there looks to be no significant signs of improvement or change over the past couple of games is very worrying. It makes you wonder how Mikel is actually trying to stop the rut and what action he is taking - whatever he is doing at the moment is clearly not working. We are poor in defence and impotent going forward. Even our pressing has gone out of the window. Unless something changes very soon and the team at least show SIGNS of improvement or getting results, Mikel is a goner. This, currently, is relegation form.
Why wud willian stop the cross? He's a double agent. Why should arteta take him off? He's an everton fan Why wud the board back him? They want the club relegated, that's why they have mismanaged player contracts, appointed an everton fan, approved the signing of 3 double agents season after season after season. But looking on the bright side, Aftv gets more views so it's just me who gets hurt.
I think..     "IT'S TIME TO GOOOOO"
I miss Claude's interviews 😪
Arsenal are fighting relegation. Let that sink in 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
You guys should stop rambling about this Arteta and find a solution how to bring back our club be it’s completely drown
DT is Arsenal through and through, absolute banter. Arteta Forever.
Must have got his dummy back the poor baby
DT actually seems like a decent lad but his anger makes him hard to manage
ITS TIME TO GO !!!!!
When Wenger left, it was warned that things could get worse.   It did get worse. Sigh.
Robbie hopes for boom or bust.. He'll be the the only one crying if he gets what he wants.. Which is mikel gone/channel done in the championship ma brother remember this... Stick with it
DT your gonna get relegated, Wanna hug pal lol lol
Hahaha relegation
The last 5 years of AFTV is the epitome of “be careful what you wish for.” DT talks about this “disease.” I think AFTV is part of this disease too...
Arsenal in big trouble what now what next. . .
Massive respect for DT💪
The current crop of players are not at the required level of ability for where the fans expect the club to be.
Ain’t the manager a Everton fan
Giroud will destroy us
Have you seen his post match interview, the clown said he was proud of the work rate of the team, once again what game was he watching, completely delusional and useless, should be sacked now!!
DT is 42 years of age. Let that sink in...
Your a big boy hold that thought !
As a Tottenham fun, am praying 🙏🏿 that u keep Arteta. I jst don’t want him to leave now. Arteta will take u places 😂😂
FREE OZIL
Trust the process DT like you always say.  Back Arteta DT like you always say .. time to admit Arsenal are in a shambles with Arteta 🤦‍♂️
MORE FIGHT IN DT PHONE THAT ARSENALS WHOLE SQUAD
I understand how everyone feels right now. But you must understand that this is not over yet. This is premier League that involves a lot magically. Arsenal going to pick a point against Chelsea. All 3 point 👉.  That is where the changes start. Watch a different Arsenal Against Chelsea. 3 points sure
We dont need to change the manager...we need to change the management of the club and fck kia joorabchian for being a sleazy agent
We really chose a manager with 0 experience over a manager with 4 league titles *including the Premier League* and tied with the most CL titles ever...Think about it...
Laugh all you want but I feel for DT man it's absolutely peak for him. I feel so upset and sorry for the entire AFTV, they play a crucial role in bringing fans together and give that community feel to Arsenal. Some people need to stop the hate man seriously. I'm a Man United fan by the way.
I tought you where going crazy obsessed with arteta, big up dt ! You where acting like you where part of the board or something I’m glad to see you smile again we all are fans everybody was behind arteta but everybody sees this can’t go further. You’re still one off my favorite pundit dt, just don’t do this political thing and talk like a fan who flipflops on results this is what football is about love to you mr dt❤️
Problems creating problems... Time will tell and I believe in mikel he tells me what I like to hear.. Unfortunately results say otherwise. I'd happily take 15th this season and slowly bullshit up the league to secess
Rat Army 🐀
Tapas Pulis Out
These guys know nothing about football  Prove me wrong
What is the disease arsenal has?
Big love DT, man's got bigger  balls than most
This is just mad
😂😂😂😂🤯
Our struggles stems from the midfield.
Where is your phone now 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
This Arsenal team have to be dissolved,they are very disgrace nd disappointing!!!
Ozil can't get in this squad for "footballing reasons" - Arteta (Managerial genius)
We should've got Ancelotti. We should've got the proven winner.
DT is a clown. According to him Xhaka is the best midfielder and Arteta is the perfect man for the job.
I’ve been in this situation with Hodgson. It’s horrible
🤣🤣🤣
DT most of the time 100% dead on you know
Why’s dt mentioning konatè and upamecano they ain’t going to arsenal if they’re life depended upon on it
Stick with it.. It will get worse before it gets better
That should of been a sending off for DT.. you can't act like that!
Serves you right, hypocrite!!!
These Arsenal fans have been spoilt with years of success & trophies. The side they have now is very very average,  they need to accept that their time has gone. It happens.
There’s always a nanosecond in these videos where I start to feel sorry for DT but the feeling passes pretty quickly
The biggest mistake is not giving the job to Thierry Henry..
We will finish about utd and Chelsea you mark my words 😁
MANCHILD speaking
Finally, this man came to lighted and manned up by saying he was wrong on constantly backing Arteta. Didn't expect that from him to say the least.
On a positive note when arsenal are in the championship at least the fans can go and watch the games 😅😂
Wenger in
Is it wrong for me to want to see Kroenke investment crumble.
The circus is back , just in time for Xmas 👍👍
Arteta..... managerial genius!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂  This is the same clown that said ‘Arteta broke Klopp’! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Chelsea next 👌👌
Be careful what you wish for
why is robbie always asking the same question??? it's not Arteta's fault the players are SH*T!!!! ARTETA IN!
Sad cocky arseholes - you lot deserve every bit of this. Laughing at United during our transition but it was never this low. You lot found a new level.
Until Arsenal get rid of some of these players  you could get any coach its gonna be a little reaction and then back to the same. The players are just not good enough and that's facts
Listen you will be alright 😅
DT rocking the Arsenal Retro gear 👀
Remember a fish rots from the head down, the whole club is rotten, it's not all Artetas fault,   He's just the poor guy who has to take the fall
The only good thing about this interview is the old skool Arsenal badge on his tracksuit!
maybe its karma for firing 50 staff just trying to make a living to pay auba 350k a week. in these times that's unforgivable
right now losing too many games
“We’ve lost every game in December”   3 days ago: Arsenal 1-1 Southampton
The biggest problem I have with Arsenal is that Ozil isn't playing and I'm not even a fan of Arsenal.
Be careful what you wish for!
The players have to earn their spots, if not make a statement and drop them for a kid who shows some passion, got to stop playing these over paid premmadonnas if they aren't going to fight, make them feel under pressure for their spots and maybe they might show some fight
Ozil is just sitting at home laughing
Arsenal getting relegated this season 🙃
Your channel is almost as embarrassing as your club 😂😂
I like how Gabriel said he didn’t choose United was because Ole’ve been looking like a PE teacher. Now the question is: if Ole looks like a PE teacher, what does Arteta look like?
We let you have the ball 2nd knowing you would do nothing with it  merry Christmas to you all you guys
The argument for this Channel used to be that it gave fans the opportunity to express themselves. However, as soon as profitable personalities emerged, the balance of airtime swung overwhelmingly in their favour. Now AFTV feels more like a soap opera, there in large part for the amusement of rival fans. You claim to represent the fanbase, and so when the likes of DT explode on camera you embarrass us all. At times it's like watching an episode of Jeremy Kyle, although I'm no longer sure who's being taken advantage of: is it the likes of TY who's only reason for being there is seemingly to be ridiculed in the comment section, or is it simply the fanbase who 's reputation is tarnished by the mad outbursts and titillating controversies of characters on this show. You set up like professional pundits (even at times appearing in traditional media and yet without an ounce of professionalism (and I'm no fan of traditional media). Whether I like it or not you are a professional outfit now, please start acting like one, and stop embarrassing all of us for your own financial gain.
One second was he about to cry at the end there?
WHAT A MANCHILD HAHA
So glad pepe didn't come to Liverpool he is so lazy just didn't want to get on the end of anything or make a run for any ball.
Tierney was the best player for arsenal?
Dt is an absolute gobshite. I cant believe he actually watches football. Knob jockey
Talk about getting out the rotten core, but some of them players are new. Willian, Pepe, Ceballos(most of the time). These players want a pay packet and that’s it
Now You Suffer From What You Did To Arsene.... Carrying Banner Wenger Out...Not Only The Board Is problem for me You as well but you were slightly better than that "Wise man"
It’s HBO quality aftv
DT smashed his phone but is wearing a cap that says behave 😂
Does dt stand for deluded twat?
Next match against (Chelsea) make Arteta the captain, that way you have a chance of not conceding an OWN goal 😭🤣💀
Please let the young ones off the leash arteta. Saliba needs to be played instead of holding. All I can see is relegation battle. What players are going to want to come to us where we are in the table and the mess the clubs in. Can we get out of this disaster?
Arsenal have now missed out on Allardyce to keep them up.
We were without our spine today, Gabriel, Partey + Auba
Aww well boys it could be worse, you could have City and Chelsea next Wait what? They do?  😂😂😂😂
william is still an agent of chelsea
Upamecano won’t go to a team in the championship, you need to face reality you are heading to the championship
I have a feeling you’ll beat us
arsenal need to play against man city aubameyang and laca and martinelli and pep and bring back klasinatch
We shouldn't be signing Chelsea rejects! Bloody hell it's not rocket science!!
You going to championship.
This man really thought Lacazette can change the game...bro he also not score a LOT!!! EDDIE SCORES THE MOST IN THE CLUB NOW!!!! This Man Wow 👏👏👏 Lacazette always miss as well don't forget THE BIG CHANCE AT LIVERPOOL THIS SEASON
Time for arteta to go its to painful
Dt smoked 72 spliffs
imagine going to training and getting passes from Özil and on matchday getting passes from Willock, must be a let down
Keep your faith Gunners. We’ve got this.
Get rid of the players!!
As a Leeds United fan, I agree with DT that yes Eddie hasn't done much to get over lacazette, but his statement of couldn't get in at a championship club (Leeds). Eddie was dealt a raw deal, he deserved way more starts but biesla just went with the squad he new more, he decided to push for our promotion rather than push Eddie's development.
arsenal fans tears give me life🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gooooing down, going down, going down!.....
Arsenal gotta look in the mirror and ask: who on chelsea's bench ist over 30 and could help us in january immediatly? lol
I’m tired Robbie
Iwobi, Walcott and many others were rightly deemed not good enough but now they would walk straight into this team.. just shows how bad they really are
Is dt that stupid that he thinks you can just rip up a contract? You have to pay them the full value of the contract to do that you don’t have to be a rocket scientist to know that ffs.
As a united fan, i would say keep him. We kept ole and he aint that bad. Arteta will turn it around. . . . . . . . Arsenal vs reading 2021/2022
This guy had a banner to throw Arsene out! Speechless at the hypocrisy
Wenger needs to come back
Lacathreat, Poope, Auboomarang, Ncrapier, Nozil😂😂😂😂
DT has some wise words. But he is wrong on Arteta.
Why so many advertisers  🥴
Big man DT. Big man. 👏🏿. It takes guts to speak frankly like that. Appreciate your honesty brother.
But we went a season unbeaten 🤣
Players are not happy
I can defend against Eddie all my life. He is just lucky to go through arsenal academy. Somthing we don't have.
Dt needs to have some humility the next time his team put a few wins together,  to quick to mock rivals... now look 🤷‍♂️
Him storming off wasn’t passion it was him being childish.
DT = Dopey Tosser
DT tell your critics to just BEHAVE
I’m gonna say it again on here! AFTV is the cure to mental illness! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m the illustration to it 🤣
I for one give him the JAN transfer window, if they bring 2-3 key players and then sell 3-4 players I'm ok to give them couple months to show they can get it going.
There’s a big problem here, how many chances do you give certain players, niles, willock, nketia, Willian, pepe, is that not the youngsters? People keep say play the youngsters but except Willian these 4 are not good enough. People can keep blaming Arteta but we do not have the players. The majority of people have been deluded by the FA Cup, Community shield and europa league results. Get real we are not good enough we need a complete clear out
"If I'm wrong i'm wrong and if I'm right , I'm right...." DT  2020
Arsenal are now another west ham AT BEST. Arsenal fans HAVE TO now acknowledge that they’re no longer an elite team. AND IM LOVING EVERY SECOND OF IT
Arsenal are shite, they're going down 👍
The days of arsenal being a big club are gone.....
Let’s be honest saka on current form is the only player that would get into klopps squad, championship is calling 🤣
Seriously, Arteta is no Ancelotti
One things that I wonder so much is why did Arsenal fans think they can replace the manager with just a socmed post or tweet? Do they think they are Kroenke? If Kroenke say Arteta stays, Arteta stays, end of story. As a fan, you just need to enjoy the L every week.
The start of DT changing colours😂😂😂😂😂 his tones changed
agent 003. his name is willian, master of stealing a living right under your nose.
We took Wenger for granted 😥😥
You no it’s bad when DT is analysing in a calm manner lol
Worst fans on the planet,happy days,long may it continue.Arteta will have a fair crack at the play offs in the championship next year😂😂😂
DT Missus is about to be in a daze and hurting
Ok arteta is out... you do you put in his position. Please advise - potchetino?
Distanced seating. Face to face talking. Nice.
Trust the process 🤣
god it would be so much worse for arsenal fans if they spent all summer trying to banter man utd spurs and Chelsea fans... good job they didn't... 🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
Xhaka’s fault today? Delusional fans. You blame the guy every damn week. He hasn’t played the past 2 matches coz of the red ofc, but look how shite they are even wo him. So its not just Xhaka’s fault everytime, its everybodys fault.
please!!! DT always talking about the rotten core (as regards players). these same players played much better football last season. we're supposedly stronger this season but we've been ass. that excuse is becoming stale.
Really you want the man who signed Willian and put us in a relegation battle to give another transfer window?? Are you crazy?? Why??
"I'm a big boy " atleast you know bro
LOL COMPARING THROWING HIS PHONE TO PASSION. NO YOU TWAT, YOU HAD A BITCH FIT BECAUSE YOU GOT CALLED OUT FOR YOUR NONSENSE EMERY/ARTETA COMPARISON
Why do these Aftv guys keep buying the Arsenal gear. Arent they Kroenke out?
It matters because if we lose in league cup we are doomed
As a Liverpool fan I'm just here for the bare entertainment 😂✌🏽
DT OUT
I m finally awake, We backed Arteta due to he was working under pep. But the outcome are nothing close to our expectation. I cannot back him anymore! He has to go now!
DT trying to make a grown man cry 😭 😒😒
I really respect DT a lot ....he might not be everyone’s cup of tea ☕️ but he’s passion and love of his club is genuinely there to be seen.
DT the broken man. Not so gobby these days 😂🤣😂🤣😂
DT's an over emotional man child twat.
Watch arsenal lose then watching AFTV is becoming a weekly ritual, sometimes twice in one week.
Look who you were under wenger look who you are now. You should be ashamed of turning on him the only people to blame is you the fans.
When is it gonna end robbie.
My mum said she’s arteta in, is she mad?
Surly the club is allowed to terminate some contracts and not pay them, as they are not doing there JOB
If we fire edu, we will win the premier league🤣
You've just missed out on Allardyce, the relegation fight specialist. Oh well...
Wenger: Y'all thought it was me
I remember Robbie saying Willian is better than Ziyech🤣🤣🤣
DT knew his father shocker!
Like the song says you don’t know what you’ve got til it’s gone. Wenger said that the club was not ready for a transition. Now we must suffer until we get it right
8 losses in 14 games. Edu and Arteta need to learn their jobs elsewhere and we need that leech Joorabchian away from this club
Without Ozil you will never win again
What scares me, is no one is going to want to come into our club, when we play like this.
Think positive, these all arteta's plan to get back ozil in january
Lacazette is ass. How don't they realize?
He has ripped apart your team already, sold Martinez who is better than Leno, got rid of Torrera and Guendozi, has frozen out your most creative and highest paid player, signed another Chelsea pensioner in a finished Willian on a 3 year deal.. never mind at least you can still ‘Partey hard’ in the championship 🤣
the sort of fan who jumps up and down in the bath , and all you need to do is throw your washing in, and pull the plug out when he has finished his tantrum
By the way, brighton will overtake us if they win today😥
I want to sign your phone after that fantastic defensive performance
Yes finally dt says something right edu must go
We shud neva hav bought players like chech-Luiz-Willian amongst others...this is the problem!!We are Afc buying 2nd hand rubbish ffs
I got to say when DT isn’t raging he actually talks a lot of sense
SELL THE TEAM! SELL THE TEAM! SELL THE TEAM! SELL THE TEAM!
Arsenal won't get relegated they'll go on a run and be ok. The worrying thing is the future, I mean what is the mindset going into next year? I don't see Arsenal being a top 4 club for the near future, they need to completely start again and find a playing style that may not be the arsenal of old in an attacking sense fans are gonna need to be patient until they find it.
Iwobi glad he left Arsenal now! 😂
Careful what you wish for 😂
What an embarrassment of a human being
September 2021  QRP 2  - Arsenal 1
Always ironic DT's slogan "behave" is never lived by example.
Hahaha
Xhaka, mustafi, Willian, Eddie, Holding, saka, lacazade, Bellerin, Non of them are good enough
Lol, if Ole and Lampard are staying, then so should Arteta
Just look back at the videos of arsenal fans thanking Chelsea for willian on a free hahaha comedy gold. Arsenal fan tv has been comedy gold from the start. Most the followers are rival fans just for pure banter. Most arsenal fans hate this channel because it embarrasses them more than the actual team hahaha keep up the good work guys my come too for a laugh almost weekly
After this interview. MrDT got my respect again. That's how men behave
🤔did i miss something? Why is auba out?
Let’s support Arteta rebuild process
How's 15th, DT?
I told u the young lions arent good enough. Just rid of Nketiah, Willock and Rowe FGS. Plus another 11 players out.
Even Fulham, no disrespect, are stepping up. I think Arsenal is having a trust & confidence issues (amongst players and players VS. manager).
Be careful what you wish for
Somehow, Willian is the worst EPL signing of the season, and arsenal got him for free 😂😂😂
Zah out
Why would someone like Upamecano or Konate sign for someone like Arsenal?
Am here to see DTs rant😂😂
Wenger In.
Trust Jesus who died for your eternal souls and not a football club. This football club, like the world, is a mess but God is in order and wants to save you all.
I actually feel bad for DT this time. For once, he spit nothing but facts especially about Kroenke and the fact that sacking Arteta rn won’t really change anything for the next 2 games
Despite Maitland-Niles having a good game I put my mortgage on Bellerin walking right back into the team.
Relegation staring at us now...
The difference is they know why they lost though..
This time next year you’re gonna be talking from the championship!!! 🤣🤣
As soon as Wenger left, everything started going downhill. He was the glue that was holding everything together. This guy was wrong then and he’s wrong now.
Why do u think we let willan go because it past by date finish while on arsenal can afford them players🤣🤣🤣
Dt actually needs to relax himself🤦🏾‍♂️🙄
Like play like play...Relegation looming...Arsenal..board
What happens when a stubborn tick sticks on a corpse?
From a rival fan ......... this is gold 🤣🤣
Arsenal didn’t have have a shot on target in the second half. Everton sat back because they knew there was no quality in the attack.
Clown team 🤪
I love watching arsenal fans cry, it's my passion.
Remember pep and klopp first years were bad by their standards they were given time and they were experienced
you suck dt
It does seem like Arteta is not up to the task.. I think if not now, then certainly for next season, Arsenal should look at a guy like me Eddie Howe, for example.  Just a thought.
Haha all the DT "hater" fanbois here, so adorable.
Maby if we go down the kronkes sell up and F OFF👹👹👹
Wenger is sitting at home just laughing at us all
Another blow for Arsenal in their bid to avoid relegation.
The “dinosaur” that they laughed at has Sonny playing like mad winning Puskas awards, he has Kane assisting like De Bruyne, and is the one man who ever had Ozil playing at the peak of his powers.
We should blame the owner for not being on top but not being on 15th position, the players we have are better than that if the manager was right.
Void the league. DT should be  shielding the virus is even more contagious now.
This club won't change until it's sold
Why do they sign players who have spent most of their career at Chelsea and expect them to care about Arsenal 😂 they’re there for a nice big pay check and an easy retirement that’s it
Arsenal have become Agents Football Club
Dt keeps telling everyone that Arteta is failing because these are not his players. Can anyone ask him if Everton's players are what Ancelotti want? He's coached Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea. Everton players are by far the worst he's had.
Arsenal needs a big manager with a big personality. Like Klop or Mourinho or Pep. Someone who the board will have big respect and not try to cross like these lil guys.
The time Leicester were top of the table and people still didn't believe they would actually win it is a similar feeling to Arsenal and relegation.
Wait, what? He thinks he's the victim now for being a vocal and verbally abusive fan?
Now go watch the match reaction after they beat Man Utd ahahahahahaha. Jokes. GGMU!
Arteta out,,ozil in
Stressamania AFTV
DT IS 100%  RIGHT
Its hard not to have a good laugh at this, after the disrespect Arsenal fans showed towards Wenger. Be careful what you wish for.
Such a drama queen lol
The fact is wenger made Arsenal now his gone  Let that sink in
Wenger should come in as director of football
Dt eating that humble pie 🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧🥧
It's easy to critize players and managers, but if you never have played a minute in your life...🤷‍♂️
Arsenal werent this bad under Wenger or Emery. Kick Arteta out and slap him on the way out. Stop blaming everyone else but Arteta!! Edu, Vinai, board they are all easy scape goats. The simple reason is a clueless manager.
I love bantering these lot but now I feel bad
It’s scary how you can go from the invincibles to this. And I’m not even an Arsenal fan.
funny that the guy killing Wenger for finishing Top 4. is sucking off arteta in the relegation zone
A half-fit Martinelli did more in 30 minutes than Willian has done all season
Too late for Arsenal, West Brom have snapped up Big Sam Allardyce
who said "Arteta is better than Klopp!"??? LOOOOOL
Literally 1 week ago DT was talking Klopp and top 4
DT has become D-Ty
Also he moans about the owners and wearing the merch
DT GIVES IT BUT CANT TAKE IT 😂
17 minute fan cam 😭
Poch In
Its time to go! Not Arteta fc
nonsense. sometime it was weird to see AFTV and these group of fans acted like professional and gave bxllshxt comments. Arteta simply not good enough.
I remember Rodgers leaving my club for Leicester and thinking it'll be a stepping stone for Arsenal, his style of play etc fits Arsenal. People laughed at me saying this about 3 years back, saying he manages in a pub league. Bet you 99.9% of Arsenal fans would take Leicesters league positions and form. Go for Rodgers in the summer, he would jump at the chance. If you get him with that team, who would get Arsenal about 4th/6th with that group of players never mind getting players of his own in.
Tbf arsenal were unlikely to win today, and will most likely lose to Chelsea. Their fans already know this. Arsenal's season recovery should start from the Brighton game. Calm down with all this relegation talk. I know it's good banter, but they'll survive.
Phone has mega bouncebackability.
First DTs hat now his phone
Let’s say it’s just Ozils fault :)
Arteta out!
Just keep Xhaka and 2nd division is ours
I don’t think many managers could do much with that team they haven’t got the players to compete with the majority of other teams in the league
As a fan ur allowed to changed ur opportunity on players and  managers yep
We have more chance finding DT's phone than finding the back of the net.
Poor lad
Business is booming at AFTV..
Save Ozil from this disgusting club
I can't believe Arteta is still there. If he was at Liverpool I'd have wanted him out ages ago.
are we going to end up in the championship! Maybe that’s the league title we will see after all these years now.
At the end Robbie should of back handed him
Arteta just got fired, bilic in
Hahaha they gave willian a 3 year contract
Arteta Out!!!
Welcome to a Uniteds fan world
Pierce Morgan said arsenal is playing better than man united and Barcelona lol.
We need a good strategist to work with arteta to help create tactics and help him to make proper decisions
Sack him tonight
Look at our team sheet man, do you really expect those players to beat Everton
Don’t understand why everyone hates on DT. Guy talks a lot of truth.
Dont sack him for that boxing day clash🤣🤣🥊🥊
Kreonke waiting for DT to say “sack Arteta” before pulling the trigger
The corruption has ate arsenal alive the players are revolting on the owners on kronke arteta has nothing to do with it
All of arsenals ex players coming back to haunt them 😂 First walcott with a goal, then iwobi with an assist; I bet giroud will score when Arsenal play Chelsea 😂😂
Ty: Our players were distracted by Ancelotti's eyebrow.
Karma is a bitch.
The Biggest Cancer in The Club is Kronke.
People take the piss, but DT does talk sense.
Season ticket for sale any1 want it
Arsenal have made a tonne a bad signings in last ten years including Arteta & Edo
Why cant we get good players for 20 million like how others clubs do, why are our footballer scouts are so lousy
Boris should listen from Dr DT about his disease control,
You can't rip up Ozil's and the lots contract unless he violates it, or unless he wants to move, so good luck with that
Everyone's fault...except Turkish. This man has been always demanding more and more, sees past the management bullshit.
We need quality players not rejects that other clubs dont want any more
Iwobi and Walcott in. Wenger in!
We need to remain calm. Suffer the defeats. See what January brings. Big month. Maybe lots planned. A new manager won’t be able to do January. Let’s give Mikel until February then assess.
This was more like DT's counselling session than an after-match analysis. DT stood there pouring his heart out, man said "it hurts Robbie, it really does". 😭
Arteta goodbye
I'm one of Arteta supporter but after today with the result Arsenal losing again no improvement bad line up as playing nketiah up top and he's keep playing willian again for 90 minute i dont understand it, its clear willian is his favourite, i think its time to go , its a shame i'd love to see what he doing in Jan but now would rather he leave before we're going deeper down
We need to remain calm. Suffer the defeats. See what January brings. Big month. Maybe lots planned. A new manager won’t be able to do January. Let’s give Mikel until February then assess.
im not even an arsenal fan, but this is what Mikel needs to play                         Leno Bellerin     gabriel       saliba     tierney             Niles         Partey saka           Laca            Martinelli                     Auba
Bring back ozil!!!!!!!!!!
Dont worry Hecky B and the all the undesirable players  will be back for the next  game
The voice tho.... are we meant to feel sorry for DT...
Wenger In!!
Arsenal competing with Fulham and Newcastle. Shocking!
You could be second in command of the Rat army by now if only you just say it as it is....🐀🐀
😂😂😂
Local spurs fan talking, well done DT , as a fan  you stand your ground  and be confident,  what happens next you deal with. Takes balls to be online,  it is what it is.
Deep stuff 😢
DT you would of done yourself a favour by apologising at the start of this  video   he criticises all the players but can not take any criticism himself .  he needs to grow up coz if I was robbie I'd of given DT a slap by now
its time for change...pochettino for arsenal
Get wenger back please
Arsenal were crying out for a manager all we got is pep’s assistant putting out cones on the training ground. This is Arsenal we are talking about. Thank you Kroenke for making Arsenal a laughing stock. Time to pack your bag and go and take your deadwood players with you.
Chelsea and Brighton are hungry for a win look whats gonna happen when we play them we are dead
At this rate Robbie would be in forbes top 20
Keep buying the left overs from Chelsea😜⚽️🤕
If you’re reading this you’re so far down in the comment section you’re nearly as low as Arsenal in the league
Middle Aged deluded baby
I think a nice season in the championship will open this damn clubs eyes, I am done
Lack of investment is the main problem.
Is north london still red?😂
Remember bad times? This is potentially the worst time
D-TY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Supporting arsenal isn't good for a one's health ✅
Love watching this channel as they implode
Balagun would have put that shot in the net , the one that Eddie missed , he keeps giving other players who are not  performing chances, while he gives the potential youngsters a nice seat on the bench
Let's all laugh at the Woolwich wanker's hahaha hahaha
DT legit believes he’s a tough guy, Logan Paul v DT book it 😂
What'd you want me to saaaay Roobbbiieeeeeee? 😁
Arsenal missed out on Big sam what a shame
The direction of Arsenal at the moment is partly due to a proportion of the fans causing a stink during Wenger's latter years and helping to force his departure. A manager leaving after more than 20 years tenure without a clear strategy of continuity was always likely to be disruptive and Arsenal are still trying to fill that legacy. If your not careful you'll end up chasing manager after manager trying to find the messiah and digging an even bigger mess.
# Bring Ozil Back
I salute  DT as a true fan it takes a big man to say he was wrong to back Arteta from a Spurs fan.
Football doesn’t work like that. A contract is a binding agreement. If you want Ozil to go you have to pay him what he is owed.  He is available and the club has decided to not play him. The club has to absorb the cost of their decision because Ozil has lived up to his part.
It's time to goooooo
How the hell did we lose 1-0 to this pile of crap???
we will not ever get anyone near as gud as mr wenger again....some ppl dont realise what we had.
Get another manager and get arteta as assistant manager, then he can learn and improve.
I’m a  united fan and I just think this guy just spent so much energy and time in getting Wenger out, that he couldn’t be asked to keep getting rid of more and more managers lol it’s quite understandable because after you’ve had 4 managers in 4 years, you do start looking at other avenues like the board and players. However even though the squad ain’t good enough to challenge for top 4, they shouldn’t be where they are now which suggest he either ain’t getting the best out of them or there not playing for him, either way he should leave.
I have being saying for weeks and weeks  that this job is to big for arteta and alot of the players are just not good enough to play for arsenal they need to go now before we go down tony.gooner
Changing the manager will do absolutely nothing. This Arsenal squad is the worst I've seen in decades.
Why would DT still  back this guy.  Stop that nonsense.  He has lost the  team. Stop trying to be overly analytical.  The team is flat  and has  no drive. He has lost the locker room. Ray Charles can see that.
Poor Arsenal😂😂
“I’m sorry I have to ask again”  *my pocket is running out*
DT has passion. Unfortunately time for Arteta to go. I don’t understand how he’s still there.
RELEGATIONNNNNNNN
You can’t just rip contracts up.  Thats not the way it works.  That will be a breach contract. Both parties to the contract have to agree to rip it up.
He doesn't know what he's doing how does he leave laca on the bench
Arsenal losing matches is a new norm these days. Arteta has to go for footballing reasons and the process.
Give Arteta 4 or 5 games after a good January transfer window
DT has to double down on supporting arteta... But you cant keep saying manager isnt backed when he chose to drop ozil, signed a few good players but no playing style. Arteta was peps cone man lol
Being Peps mate does not mean you are a good manager.  Ancelotti should have been our manager.  Lets get Poch NOW.
DT is the ruin of Arsenal FC
With the same players we have if we bring in Diego Simone, we will get top four in the first year guarantee. Arteta is to nice to shy and too inexperienced! He is a good man and that’s that
I'm not an Arsenal fan, but they need to stick with him. The laughs i get every week is amazing.
DT is a real clown isn’t he?
DT is too embarrassed to admit he was wrong
Keep the faith DT when it goes right you’ll like genius
IMO Arsenal need Rafa Benitez. He can come in and stable the ship for two seasons and then hand off to a better manager. Arsenal can't bring in a new, long-term manager until the ship is stabled. Rafa can do that better than anyone. DT and Robbie are both 50% correct. It's the players AND the manager. That's why their situation is so maddening right now.
Footballing reasons.... Arteta really was simply a guy putting out the cones at man city loooooooool
at least next season Arsenal will get a trophy     for premier league promotion from championship
Is this an obituary its o slow and sad
You can only get rid of these players if you pay up their contract
No longer a big club, stop thinking you are and it will be less painful.
IM ONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL
I want someone to explain to me who is going to be that new manager that you lot are talking about??? Please tell me?
Worse start since 1974😅😅the wenger out bum boys(kenny ken, DT)etc says... wenger is the reason arsenal is in this mess.talking bullshit.if that is the case,when a new manager comes in, his job is to impove the team and make them better than the last manager!well ARTETA as not made anything better.he just made things 100 times worse!thanks to you (wenger out mugs)liverpool got a new manager and they got better,tottenham got better,man city got better,everton got better!we get arteta and everything crumbles!
DT must be having an affair with arteta...
Auba.            Martinelli     New player                        New player                       New player.        Partry    BTierney.Gabi. New player.       Amn                           Leno        Buy aoura. Zaha opamacano
The irony of DT’s hat. BEHAVE 🙏🏻
I wonder if you will be playing Cardiff and Birmingham next year? Arteta is not experienced enough for a club like Arsenal, but the players should be ashamed of themselves.
DT I don’t know you are been biased. Pepe was the worst player on that peach, the worst signing, no work rate. William was far more better than Pepe
His phone is completely fine, not even a scratch, just shows how many actually watch the videos haha!
to be fair , we shouldnt kick a man when he is down..fair play to dt, its not even fun to laugh at arsenal anymore
Mustafi and Gabriel are our headers of the ball
We are not winning any games not like this, we need a top manager and fighter for player.
Arsenal are now in the tin pot category. Its funny as Evertons co-owner wanted to buy Arsenal and take them forward lmfao and got pushed out the club and forced to sell his shares.   Arsenal fans are the type who live off the past. You USED to be a big club times change. Not anymore.  Your owners wont say their is an Koulibaly or something because Arsenal are a Now Small club
R.I.P Phone 😆😆
Loan these boys Nketia,Eneny willock,Bellerin etc and bring new boys.This is not about Arteta, Arsenal don't hve good materials for the premiership.
Robbie Robbie Robbie. Every time you change the manager....you start again. Simple as. We can’t keep starting again over and over again.
Robbie licking his lips
" As soon as I saw Nketiah I switched off the tv "
Ty busy taking a knee for DT’s phone 📱
One of the biggest Wenger out knucklehead. And still finding fault with everyone but the one who is most responsible—Arteta. The man is out of his element!!
😂😂😂😂😂
When DT starts saying wenger was wright you know things are really bad
A wise man once said “it’s time to go blud, it’s time to go blud”
AFTV turned into ADTV. Money's got to Robbie's head. Unsubscribed.
Emery was 10 times better than arteta!
The way Willian screwed over Spurs for Chelsea why would you think that he’s anything but mercenary? He’s got a lovely big weekly cheque that’s all he cares about £££
Finally DT you r back to our senses
I only watch this channel when the Arsenal get stuffed.
I think Robbie is arteta in so he gets paid . I think it’s time for Robbie out?
That away kit bests represents Arsenal...its a bloody mess 😂😂😂
Robbie entering the Forbes billionaire's list today
Honestly, playing Willian is the only gripe I have with Arteta's decisions. Glad to see Martinelli back, and when he came on his attitude was infectious. Everton have a better squad if we're honest. Looking at it man for man they are a better team.  Honestly the summer can't come soon enough, when we can seriously get rid of the players that aren't good enough, and bring in the 2-3 players we need. We need to overhaul the midfield, 2 number 8s that can also play as a 10 if needed to change tactics. The squad isn't good enough. We do need to get 3 points against the teams below us though, not draws. Mid-table finish is it for us.
I would never have imagined a future when David Luiz and Willan would have been considered our senior players, this is a team that needs a complete overhaul.
West brom beat arsenal to big sam 🙈
ratioed
You bench a player who is out of form, and sack a manger who is out of form
IPhone 12 pro for sale, brand new never used! DT, get in touch mate its yours for the right price 👍
See DT is still lining stans pockets by buying every new bit of merch, smh.
The real problem is the owner, there is no escaping that, Arsenal have been on a free fall since 2005
Yes DT flilping out live. Legend
Arteta better than lampard😂😂😂😂
DT is a broken man.
Maitland - Niles the best player in the match?? He got spun at least five times and was out paced at least twice by Godfrey, just because it didn't end in goal doesn't mean he was the best player. Jeez the levels...no wonder people saying DT has no clue what he is talking about. No wonder People are taking notice now about how clueless he is. Not saying Maitland Niles is bad...just saying how clueless Dt is...re-watch the match or atleast watch the highlights and see where the attacking play and defensive play generally comes from on both sides. Atleast that will give a better idea. 😌😌😌
Different tune on dt today
If Arsenal gets relegated to League 1, DT will still back Arteta
Kroenke is the virus of Arsenal!!
these promos are so effing annoying in the start and why is it so much louder than the actual video?????? WHEN DOES IT END ROBBIE???????????????
& that's another 60 quid you've given to Stan by buying yet another new top! 👍🏼
Luton Town and QPR are more Arsenal level these days
You only threw your phone for the attention and traction. Shut up
Trust the Process la
Every week...."We improved in the second half" man we should be playing good in the first half too
Kroenke and Arteta out
Arteta in in in
I wasnt happy with the summer transfer window and I couldnt understand how Robbie and other AFTV people were happy with it
DTs phone..." I'm sick of it Robbie "..😂📱
Arsenal has a medical problem!!!! DT is breaking it down 😂😂😂😂
DT probably wanted to blame Bellerin for today again, the big crying Man child
DT didn’t ask your permission before dashing that phone 🤣🤣🤣
Sacking managers is stupid short term strategy.   We should remain patient and not come to conclusions before March
Is it me or DT Lost some weight looks in shape 👀
DT still creaming over Arteta when it's clear he's a dead man walking. We did not back Emery (a better manager) when he was getting poor results but we have backed Arteta by giving him far more time than he deserves. Any other big club would have sacked their manager by now and found a suitable replacement. Instead, we have our director of football telling us that Arteta is doing a good job.
Now there’s no bellerin and xhaka let’s see what DT will say
If Arsenal get relegated do you think they will win the championship?
Took so long 2 play laca....Eddie is filt....he is greedy takes long 2 pass the ball....he kills play...pepe was gettin upset
berndesic from juv n call bac torriea
DT IS A MAN CHILD. END OF
Dt,you need to show that same energy towards Arteta that you showed to Wenger when you want him sack.
Give him a chance. Stop but. It is going to be painful it will work out
We might have to get relegated in order to actually make change in this Club. We have coasted since Van Persie Left.   We are ok with mediocre play and ok with relegation form.
We will be fine when Partey comes back.
AFTV is like the office i refuse to believe these guys are for real
Imagine what the state of this club will be when Brighton beats Arsenal next week 🤯🤣
DT: git.
you need Steve Bruce and JoeLinton
Willian played better dan Eddie by far....he played well in the 2nd half
If Arteta goes it will be a sad day for all other teams supporters. This era has been a golden one for laughs.
Arsenal is in that position now where even making a joke about them makes me feel sad😂🙁✌👀
How many defeats do arsenal have thus far?
Mind the gap hahaha
where is Reiss Nelson, he can save Arsenal
Wenger in!
Arsenal goes to championship Mission almost succses 👍👍
DT storms off but they noticed I need to do my interview  D Flip Flop T
Lol it’s just a soccer game get over it or watch something else
DT 👶🏻
yeah but miki is banging in the goals for Roma mate
4 points of bottom 3
DT sounding a bit like Turkish.
Take ur time with it!! Take ur time with it! Take ur time with it!!   Remix! Arsenal going down with it! Arsenal going down with it! Arsenal going down with it! 😂😂😂😂😂
DT is a RAT😂😂😂😂😂
I want the best for Eddie, BUT HE IS NOT ARSENAL STANDARD
lucky tho phones alright
Diego Simone at any price! I can’t believe no one is talking about him.... he is the only coach left who can turn us into a proper team at this moment
P45 for senor Arteta.
Arteta broke Klopp tho
Jesus christ. Get DT to his mum he needs a cuddle. Put down the mic. Come back next year when you're top of the championship
My mum said Arteta in... is she mad!!
TY: Yes we lost but how many teams have managed to stop Calver Lewin from scoring this season?
arteta OUT!
As much as I have slatted DT for backing Arteta I can't help but feel for the DT's pain. As Arsenal fans we all feel it even when some of us saw the writing on the wall sometime ago
Fair play to DT owning up to his fault
Arsenal are becoming the Jets of football
Please, ASAP:Arteta out out out. The guy hasn't got a plan B to save Arsenal season. A u**less loser.
remember Luaren? He played in a team with Bergkamp, Henry and Pires. He was the penalty taker
At least Arsenal would be in a Champions League again. Champions🚢⛵
Arsenal the retirement centere
Who did Arsenal overpaid for, Willian or Pepe?
We were in the same position u lot were in. But they were lucky LFC had me in their academy...
Arteta In
Even if arteta gets the sack tonight, it doesn't mean arsenal will magically improve overnight, I don't see arsenal finishing in the top 10 this season
These players on high wages dont wanna leave so will gladly sit out there contracts and make millions that's why u cant shift them out of the club
DT is calm and relaxed and regurgitating what Turkish has been saying all along
He's only human and he broke his phone.....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Changing the Manager won't bring improvement.Players not good enough.End of story.Simple as.
Think the phone throwing was a setup, smashes phone to then get sponsored by etoro is to ironic 😂
Still blaming Ozil? Unbelievable!!
mans still sayin upamachano 😂
Yerry Christmas! :-)
We are stuck in a very bad rut now. Because they stuck with Arteta so long, no top players will want to join us to help us out this mess, no top manager will take the job. We are fucked, honestly.
Liverpool fans drove tom hicks and the other clown right out the city....the whole fanbace untied in protest
Arsenal is cursed by Ozil's decisions
These players are not good enough...They have had 3 managers to try and figure it out. Arteta is the right guy. I do not agree with playing Willian but he is the right guy for the job
DT out!! FOOOOOL!
No apology to Don Robbie for being a massive cry baby. Don Robbie made this fool & should show some respect.
The reason why frank lampard is a better manager than arteta is because last season we had no signings or anything and we still came 4th and your not even near the top 10 and arteta has done that to you
Willian's 3 year plan is definitely coming to fruition.. long may it continue 🤣
Is he Crying?
For ppl saying we have no luck because the ball doesn't drop  to us haha. Let me tell you this , you make your own luck . There's something called  winning second balls in football and players  train for that . it's all about positioning and coaches drill their teams for this . Our team appears to be a bunch of individuals strolling around  and you wonder why calvin flicks it  or we clear a ball and there's a player on the opposition ready to snap it .The winning the  2nd balls thats why . no luck in that
I think changing the manager would help because it would give the players a lift. Right now Arsenal, players have a down beat vibe. They lack cutting edge, and i don't think Arteta, has the right words of inspiration to give them players the energy they need for the next 2 games. Because today game was a must win, for Arsenal, and once again they lost the match. For me this is down to the manager getting the team selection wrong. I hear what dt, is saying about running through mañagers and getting the same dead results. But tbh honest Arteta, is the best and the worst manager out of the lot so far. This season has been a shambles for Arteta, were you are in the table is more than enough reason for Arsenal to change manager. Your 2, point off the bottom 3, at Christmas that is stackable material
DT is so tired of arsenal he doesn't have enough energy to say "I'm tired robbie"
6:05 is DT wenger in 😂😂😂😂
Monetized this video to the max 🙃
DT looks broken
“ we signed your best player and he rejected you , deal with it Chelsea fans “ DT
Keep Arteta for at least 5 years even we might be in championship 🤣
Well then take it as you said. Stop looking for a quick fix in firing a manager. Sit through this season and suffer. Dismantle the team and start again
Why is he playing Rob Holding, Nketiah, Elneny, Willian... these are Championship players and that is where they are going. You can't blame the players; they have never been any good. HE is choosing them; he thinks he can make these stinkers better. Hah! If they keep playing, Arsenal are going down. No More Holding!!! To make him captain is a crime.
Forget Allegri, Poch,Hassenhutl and Rodgers. They have no reason to go to Arsenal. The only man to bring in is Rafa. Great organizer, clean out the deadwood. This from a Liverpool fan.
Every week he storms off like a bitch, but always comes back. These man love the clout.
Plot twist: There Tottenham fans
its the players its like they don't even like each other some one in that dressin room is corseing problems
Stop the crosses is a no brainer. Work hard is a no brainer. If Arteta has said this and Willian has ignored it than Arteta drops him for a few games. If he hasn’t, Arteta’s a P.E. Teacher tbh. You watch willian play within the next 2 games, probably the next one lol. He didn’t even organise cones, he put them where he was told to!
🍿
Get this bTec Alex Hleb out of here now.   Was never a great player for us and is defo not a good manager.
Such a complete and utter twat
Outeta lost this game for the love of his club - Everton.
Arteta man management is bad why let guenduzi go just because kid made mistake big deal, you could have had torreira guenduzi partley and ozil in middle look way different but this is bullshit
Next year is bringing us the DT derby: Arsenal v. Luton Town
Arsenal are a massive football club. Arteta was never the right manager.
Keep ya head up Derrick
Arteta is not the problem
Bring Wenger back
MANCHILD
DT keep going
These interviews are so relaxed now. I come here for therapy 😌
I remember a few moons ago Leeds and Blackburn supports said “our teams are way to big to be relegated”.
Finally DT is coming around to admitting he was wrong about Arteta. I wonder if he'll ever admit he was wrong about his Wenger out campaign?
It appears the Rats have struck a decisive victory this day 🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭
Mr DT wants the owner (and the board) to take decisions whether to keep or sell players. Amazing. That is how football clubs were run 60 years ago. Football related question are managed by the football manager and the technical director.
Maybe if we get relegated and josh reports to Stan he might just take notice...could be blessing in disguise.
Is changing at this stage going to do more damage?
I bet you wish you had Wenger 🤣😂🤣🤣
DT to stubborn 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️
You BIG BABY 🍼 🤣
Robbie scared after the watch along lol
Wenger in
Arsenal are in a relegation battle thnext 3 games are i believe beyond this team ,as set up,Shakespeare said, WHEN TUS DONE TWERE WELL TWERE DONE QUICKLY!!!!! NEW MAN OR THE MIRE...
Man child......
arteta in
You don’t have a: Viera, Henry, Bergkamp, Keon, Campbell....Why do you think this team will be any good to win anything?
Leno pulled his hands out of the way for the own goal
Are we still rats ???
Wenger out???
Man wears that cap as a reminder to himself when he looks in the mirror
DT talking about roots, maybe he should think about another career choice and become a Gardner.
Face it, DT will be a full memeber of the rat army by the end of the year.
He said upamecano 😂😂😂😂😂. This man is dreaming!! Why will he leave Leipzig 😂😂
Prayers prayers prayers 👀📰
DT's childish rants is paying for a new extension on Robbie's house.
Respect to you DT man..
Arsenal have the making of a good team and a good manager. A few players with a bit of steel need bringing in and the picture will be a lot different.
*DISEASE* 🤣🤣🤣🤣😄😄😄😄
i feel sorry for dt ty robbie etc it hurts them to see arsenal like this theyve watched them under prime wenger fighting with united for the league, guaranteed champions league every year sometimes even an fa cup every yr or other yr same with united their owners have let them down
DT obviously never had a dad that give him a back hand when he threw his toys out the pram. PUSSSSSAAAAAYYYYYYYY
DT is a child in adult body😭
I really like Arteta’s personality but what time does he need. Our players are playing badly because his system is too complicated. We need faster football in their half. If we were mid-table, we could tolerate but another manager Rodgers, Ancelotti, Nuno, Hasenhuttl would all do better with this same £300m team
You lot are just the gift that keeps on giving.
its always : but the second half wasnt so bad....
Time to realise that, this is kind of on you guys, since this channel got big, arsenal has been worse and worse every season... wenger out, emery out, arteta out, players out, board out,  but aftv in? haha
Wake up people!!! The board, the recruitment the players and the manager need a change
Speaking of Upamecano, as if he would go to Arsenal 😂😂😂
A wise man once said: “He has to go blud”
People are so quick to jump on arteta
So the players took the “ Take your time with it “ really seriously.
I can imagine wenger having the time of his life now
Fans have no clue
Only Sam Allardyce could save Arsenal from relegation
Can som1 explain 2 me how any of this is Artetas fault??
we need to put pressure on where it should be : the board and the owner .
DT you big baby lmfao
Being a loyal fan to teams like arsenal must be unhealthy. I’m United fan and I no longer care how they’re doing. I like them but I refuse them to ruin my days.
Arteta said at the press box that when a ball gets played across the box it is 50/50 and you can't help the results in an excuse for conceding the  goals....... So why do we use that as our only offensive attack. He's eating his tail.
Based on how poor this team is at the moment. Would keeping miktarian had been better? At least I know he can dribble and move with the ball. This shows decision mistake constant made by the board.
the man bear pig  dt
You shouldn’t feel bad for backing him DT it doesn’t matter what manager we get in next, as I feel he won’t do any better then the others. Just my opinion. There has to be a reason why he’s playing certain players to others ?
Big baby dt 🍼
He’s got to get sack bye Christmas  He’s going to be sack at Christmas  I hope he gets sack bye Christmas  I’ve been a arsenal fan for 28 years
Companies act only when their profits are effected, stop your season tickets, stop buying merch and then things will change
If people are laughing that we will get relegated. Are you laughing now, I’m scared. We don’t look like no matter what team we play that we’re going to get a result. We need a change from top to bottom.
Rob .. what is happening to Arsenal is  beyond what a simple fan could understand . There is a big gang trying destroy the club You as a faithful Arsenal fan must be able to uncover the conspiracy against Arsenal . Please do something to save the club that we truly love ❤️
How can nketiah still be anywhere near the first team?
DT . U know I own one of your hats. . All the way in canada.    That was one of your most mature interviews ever. I support everything you just said.   Somehow., Arsenal FC will get through this in the next year.
RAT ARMY 🐀🐀🐀
How many likes for that MANCHILD guy in the watchalong superchat? 👏👏
Arteta In🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😁
I do feel bad for DT
Reports are saying that DT’s Mrs is booking flights to Dubai after seeing the treatment of his phone
DT is worse then my kids
Everyone is like we need to change the manager.....who tf is gonna come in....wenger should have stayed. All downhill from there. Sacking arteta could confirm relegation because there is no better alternative....unless Wenger maybe makes a comeback or klopp gets bored of winning.
Wenger in.
Banta FC🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Deluded clown.
We all know its the end for Mikel I am afraid, he has dug his own grave now. Rogers or Allegri now
What happened to your phone, did it slide off the table?
DT: Route of the Problem is Kroenke   Also DT: Buying Merch continuously, AFTV continously buying Merch etc   Kroenke: Keep giving me the dollars bro 😂😂😂
Dt is coming back slowly. He have reflected. This is a good singing.
Willian doesn't even follow Arsenal on social media plus we have another 2 years of willian , will he get any better
Mad how aftv was responsible for wenger leaving and now they can’t even get in top 10
The most sensible and real interview with DT instead of him talking crap
Now_Kick the owners out   Maybe DT should coach Arsenal  And invest in Arsenal
Arteta made us thinks he was Pep 2.0.....GET THAT FRAUD OUT😡😡😡
lol if he would of took a touch and missed they would say he should of hit it first time  🤣
Arteta is so bad that DT has now finally admitted that Wenger was RIGHT... *FOOL!*
He probably burned a zoot to calm down
Manchild lol
Arteta is the worst coach in the world. I will say that over and over again. Even if arsenal signs Ronaldo or messi, they wont win anything. Relegation is our place until arteta goes
Good ebening 🤣
Where is the balance in these interviews? One or two remain in favour of giving Arteta time but Robbie is clearly Arteta out and he just not listening to the rational arguments. The squad is mediocre, replacing the manager is not a long term solution. Give Arteta the resources to rebuild the squad in his image.
Click LIKE to demand DT to issue public apology to Wenger!
If you change the manager over and over and nothing changes, what makes you think changing the manager AGAIN is going to change things?
I’m wishing this season will end up having a “All Or Nothing” documentary for it.
I have to say as an Everton fan that I felt sorry for Arsenal today. Watching the game I felt that Arsenal had no motivation or drive and just strolled around the pitch. I have seen it here at Everton and looks like there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Arsenal don’t deserve to be in this position but the higher ups don’t seem to care. I doubt you will be relegated but a big rebuilding job is needed like that at Man United after Ferguson left. Things will get better
Arteta just rubbing salt in his own wounds with some of those selection of players
Nketiah couldn't make into the Championship Leeds team, Yet starts for Arsenal.
Arsenal are getting relegated lol
Arsenal fc retirement club for Chelsea players 😂😂😂 Come on you blues the pride of London
DT : Arteta broke Klopp..  Hahahhahhahahaha ... this fat deluded one.
DT stop acting like your a celeb, ain't shiiiii
Is anybody else getting this following feeling... AFTV is crumbling just like the football team?
Respect Dt
You don't have to be a football genius to see Willian is crap! Whatever it's in that contract he signed he's going to be Arteta's Waterloo. You can't insist on the same player, game in game out, and he isn't performing.
Ozil banged juj on us
DT losing weight, must be fasting till arsenal win a league game
We loose again I’m rioting
'It's been like this since 1948. When's it gonna end, Robbie? Bring back Herbert Chapman, that's what I say.' .....  DT's dad, aged 80.
Ah yesss komedi
The question is which decent manager is willing to take over this mess?
better change manager now before transfer so he could get players... if they sack mikel after it'll be stupid
DT looks smaller
Ty: At least we got the away goal!
Chelsea retirement club. Guys are just milking Arsenal dry until they get relegated. When they lose to Brighton we are gonna be really in for a treat and I for one can’t wait.
Remember though Arteta broke Klopp! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When is it gonna end wobbie😂😂😂😂😂
You remember how you clowns were going on when you beat utd?? Look at you now. I don't hate arsenal they're a great team and when utd and arsenal were battling for the PL it was the most exciting time in PL history proper rivals with elite players and real passion not these soy boys Liverpool and man city 💤💤💤. It's the arsenal fans that let them down
Sending LOVE to us'all, we need it.
Bring back Wenger
This guy is pathetic. Has been for years.   He knows that Arteta deserves to be sacked but his fragile ego can't allow himself to turn around and admit that and go against what his original opinion was. He gets angry every time Robbie brings it up to him, you can see him burning inside. When you are wrong, you should be able to admit that, or at least have a mature discussion about it instead of storming off, throwing your toys out the pram and aggressively shouting at your 'friends' and targeting them as if they're picking on you.  Sets a bad example to AFTV's young audience. Bloke's a joke. Never been so embarrassed to have an Arsenal fan like that amongst our fanbase ever! Definition of a manchild. If only he didn't make Robbie so much wonga, then maybe he'd be off the channel.
Arent these guys the same guys that say "give Eddie a start" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
its arsssssssseeeeeeeenaaaaaaaaallllllll and tomaaaaaaassss ppppppaaaaarrrrrrtttttteeyyyyyyy.........bum bum bum
To all those bantering fans from other clubs: Honestly you are embarrassing. Read a book or something. Imagine being invested in other clubs fan bases. How lost can you be??? Stay healthy and never forget it’s you who paid for those heavy wrists!
DT flipping and flopping is so embarassing
Willian is regretting signing for arsenal as much as the gunners regret signing him aswell
Arteta said he was backed by the club, so why is Mr DT saying he was not backed enough. Arteta himself made those statements, is it that Arteta don't know what backing means again?
Say what u want about dt but the man speaks sense
Expectations have surely dropped in this club, which is just embarrassing.
Same old Arsenal.... Great going forward...Weak at the back...
RAG N PHONE MAN
Why is DT not getting angry anymore?
Nothing will improve until we get rid of luiz willian Nketiah elneny
Robbie is the best at this
Honestly the Arsenal  players are not good enough and they Will let this club regulated
DT’s phone has more cracks in it than the Arsenal defence
DT’s screen protector needs a lifetime achievement award atp
Man's got a behave hat and can't even behave himself🤣🤣🤣
Arteta  out I hope arsenal do not give  him the january window transfer it will  be a big. Mistake Allegri. In now with.  Experience.
Go do one dt ,aftv bring back wenger banner please
17 mid rolls in this video must be a banging video and want to rake in the ps
This the same clown that wanted Wenger out!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 be careful what you wish for you CLOWN
good ebening
DT: Deluded Toddler
Think DT has come to the realization that he was wrong about Wenger lol.
BANTERNAL FC enjoy NEXT YEAR In championship vs Charlton 😂😂😂😂😂
Be careful of what you wish for, DT, “Thank you for the service but it’s time to say goodbye”
Think it's starting to show how good matteo guendouzi was
Comedy gold as an Everton fan this makes it better dt raging massive forehead on him
You guys haven’t seen anything else when. You and deluded troop are shouting Wenger out didn’t we tell u ? It’s just the beginning. It will get worse before it gets better . I’m happy you are enjoying your stupidly
remember the joke of arsenal and 4th position 😂😂
Arteta Out. Stop defending this fraud. In the bottom 3 on Boxing Day
DT defends Arteta better than any footballer
DT can make phones fly better than Arteta will ever be able to manage a football club.
DT's screen protector is a better defender than Holding.
Shocking when mentioning top strikers in the league the first two mentioned were Spurs players.... haha!
Who’s doing the shopping for a new manager? I don’t think Arteta reports to Edu. So that rules out Edu. Are Vinai and Josh Kroenke really the football experts to find and hire a new manager?
what about the people that owne the club got  at them
Remember when u was laughing at a Madrid for 1 bad game. There top of the league now and your 15th. Your part of the problem just as much as the players
This board doesn't do value buying...
Remember when u was laughing at a Madrid for 1 bad game. There top of the league now and your 15th. Your part of the problem just as much as the players
ITS TIME TO GO
Before judging him too much, check out 15:40 onwards.
17 midrolls... at this rate Robbie will buy Arsenal
I’m not here to cause a stir but I mean come on... deprived of what exactly DT? You spent 72 million on Pepe! That’s ludricous, yet everyone quick to jump on Pogba whilst Pepe has average after average performance. Auba 60+ million. Partey, Gabriel, Leno, Willian, luiz... deprived of what exactly... Arsenal are in big big trouble. Arteta in or out isn’t going to fix this mess. Going to take years and a brave manager to offload the deadwood but at the same time bringing new players in... sad times for the gooners
Sums him up. Total twat
"I am whining Robbie.."
then stop being delusional and back Arteta out campaign
Arsenal nearly losing as many matches as AFTV has mid-rolls
Laca should be playing there no second thought, I do not understand is this modern football ? As a manager what you measure or require when you ask your inexperienced striker to go and start.  Second, Willian can be a good no10. Play Auba on the right Laca upfront and saka/pepe on the left and Willian/dani  behind Laca.  What I see is everything is happening on experimental mode, today we lose lets try Eddie today we will lets keep the same formation, so no thought process involved why or how to rotate team on the basis of opponents.  There is no mind set as what and how we should play, this is where we are lacking in terms of managing Arsenal.  We are in a relegation fight, oh god what the heck is happening, worse and getting worse after every match.
We’ve got Carlo and you’ve got a geezer who lays out cones for pep! Yerry Xmas lads 💙
Arsenel should of choose second team they would of tried harder
Konate and Upamecano. He's definitely dazed lol
DT, it´s only a phone mate. Loads of those out there, too many actually.
Dt getting angry over a comment ! weak twat !
Why not get Rafa and make arteta assistant like with pep
funny how DT was one of the main voices for WengerOut and now he is one of the only voices for ArtetaIn, DT needs to man up and say he has been wrong to keep backing him. you keep backing him you will sone be in the championship, DT you got it wrong and its not the first time
But Willian is better than Ziyech
If this was ole gunna you would screaming for him to be sacked. Just because he looks good you lot have patience hahahah joke
If the club is not GNA play ozil the club is gna suffer
Arteta didn't broke klopp he broke DT
Upemacano!!! 🤣😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Deluded fans  especially that ty bonkers don't let your heart rule your head 40 years at least you will have to wait for any success deluded fans arsenal are shut simple
I like arteta but he needs to go. Brighton and Fulham are catching up on us, this relegation arsenal are stirring at if nothing is done to change the course.
Nice to see DT come out and calm down and explain himself. Spoke with a lot of sense after the initial rant and I agree with a lot of the comments made
Ole and Lampard have to go on the worst run of games in history in order to finish under Arteta like DT predicted some time ago.
No one:   Dt: I remember seeing a worse game back in 1802 so everything is ok
This is why arsenal are the ultimate banter club. Your fans get gassed way too quickly, over the top antics and celebrations praising your team as if they're 2011 Barca. FA cup papered over the cracks, Arteta was never the one and never will be. Top to bottom whole club needs to be scrapped.
Your local  Derby next season is Brentford  in the Championship 😁😁😁😁😁😁
👊📱
Bad role model for children
DT looking like D TY 🤣😂🤦🏾‍♂️
Rag n Bone man lost it today
Stan kronke bought shares of arsenal in 2007 one year after the champions league final .lts all downhill since but in 2018 he took 100% ownership  and he used arsenal  collateral for projects like new 5.5 billion stadium in the United states he doesn't care about arsenal football club
This guy deserves a good slap and I hope he does
this interview from DT regained him a lot of respect in my book. I had really lost a lot of respect for him lately.
If anyone thought we was going to win this game is a fool get that clown out now
Mkhitaryan is tearing up seria a
To be fair this is the most sense DT's made in a while
Can't even blame Xhaka
DT's a manchild... Throws his toys out the pram...
Hat : Behave  Man : throws phone and jumps around
Hey everyone go check out Toffee tv "instant match reaction" from 12 mins in, you will love it .....guaranteed to make you smile
I didn't want to judge Arteta till the end of the season but with the way things are going, I'd give him till the end of Feb. The board has to back him in Jan and give him quality signings such as a CAM and sort this mess out. If after the backing we are still failing to win games then he has to go. Would love to see this man be successful with us.   Its down to the board, show that you  care and prove that Arteta is really the man for the future by backing him in Jan !!!
Championship league lads snm..
r.i.p dt's phone the new iphone 12 is out i think
longest fan cam ever?
Imagine is James Rodriguez was playing
When DT talks like this - calmly- he makes alot of sense.
Fire this clown Robbie
Another thing, I noticed that Arteta always bring in substitutions too late especially when we’re losing and when players on the first team are not performing well. It’s frustrating man. SMH
What a child😂😂😂😂
Tbh this is a good interview from DT. It is facts and he is not being deluded.
This guy has lost the plot how can he compare Wenger, Emery and arteta together. Arsenal are 15th after 14 games
Robbie Eating Good Tonight
DT is a cokehead pass it on
There’s a reason why DT is the most watched... he may let the emotion get the best of him sometimes but he speaks facts and is no way shape or form deluded.... BEHAVE
arsenal going to championship,ahahhahahahhsh,just a small club from london
Arteta broke DT and DT broke his phone and  broken klopp is top of the league 👏
Good Ebening I'm from EE would you like a upgrade?
One week rob holding  Next week bellerin  Next week willian  Next week David Luiz Next week mustafi Next week xhaka Next week elneny   But They never blame the best players the have ffs NEVER aubameyang NEVER saka NEVER TIERNEY'!!! NEVER lacazette NEVER GABRIEL NEVER EVER EVER LENO  NEVER MARTINELLI  NEVER partey  NEVER PEPE
Watching any interview is just meaningless after "Fanny Ceballos". Almost makes losing hurt less, made me spit out my drink.
Edu will sign DT's phone, they need something solid in that defence
Robbie please bring back international reactions
Wenger out banner 🙈🙈😋😋
I just dont understand why there is still fans that back arteta! I mean what was our expectation from arteta for this season ? Ofcourse it was getting to an european competition but who are the teams that also had the same goal? Everton? We lost to them wolves? We lost to them ? Man city ? We lost to them ? Liverpool? We lost to them leicester? we lost to them ? Spurs? We lost to them even aston villa doing well this season we lost to them. So beating fulham and those kinda teams won't change anything.
Dt has brainwashed himself so much that he can't see that Arteta is crap
I would give a leg to have Wenger back right lol now
You can’t back Arteta anymore it’s time To G0
DT you can't just terminate these contracts, if the player shows up that's what he's liable to do, if you decide afterwards you don't like him anymore you can trade, sell, or agree to mutually terminate but no player is doing that unless you payout the term of the contact. They paid Mykatarian to just go away because be was such poison. Clubs can't afford to just up and payout 5, 6, or 7 contracts to term then go buy new players and pay them, especially now.
DT starting to chirp the tune Turkish has been saying for two years...
suck it up. ur in the prem and thats where youre staying. other clubs have it worse.
Have fun with relegations goons
Atleast he came back for the interview give him some props
DT was delusional until oh wait still delusional 😂
Willian should have started in front of Elneny with Martinelli and Lacazette up top.
Wow , you know it's bad when DT compliments Spurs forwards Kane & Son 😂
DT = Deluded Tryhard
DT finally back down on planet earth. Most sense I’ve heard from him all season.
Fraud
We are finished, I've accepted it.  It doesnt affect me anymore.  I'm done.
Why do you fools act like you were doninate like man united or sumat?!? Its hilarious how deluded you lot are. You have always been second best so deal with it
Big up DT, total respect ✌🏽
loss, draw, loss, loss,loss, draw, loss
Arteta out end of
U deaf dumb and blind
The problem with Arteta is he keeps playing Willian everyday and he is ineffective and lazy.....Where was pablo and he is good on the ball than holding. Why did he start Nketiah? For me it shows lack of experience amd naivity on the managers part...let him leave. It reminds me of moyes at Man U
Talking about the transfer window as if anyone will join this mess
I salute you DT. For being a man admit we can all be wrong or right sometimes 👍👍👍
It's killing me from inside, Robbie. Make it stop 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Let's get real , who would want to go to Arsenal FC in January window to fight out a relegation scrap, especially in the way the team fight currently. Damage is done!
Funny, two games ago he was praising willian and now the expert wants him off
Why not use the youth like brussia Dortmund? And let the deadplayers sitt and see.? Leno Niles, gabriel luiz, tierny  Smith willock elneny  Zaka balogun Nilson
At this time, you got to think a win win for the team and the player. Burnley cant even buy any of these arsenal players so they are stuck in arsenal. They need a new coach that can put them back in the spotlight so they are marketable. But with Arteta, no player will come in to arsenal and no player can be bought from arsenal. Only solution now is to change the coach.
It's sad you are monetizing off this lads pain. It's almost as if you want Arsenal to lose because you know that you make more $$$. It's sad lads.
👑👑Keep Kane and Son outcha mouth DT.
No Bellerin no Xhaka, and we’re still taking L’s. So, who is DT blaming now?
DT you used to be our biggest hope to get Wenger and Kroenke out, but you bottled it. Like Arsenal do
DT,  get this right, changing managers frequently is currently  one of the characteristics of a big club. Man U, Chelsea, Liverpool, City, and co frequently changed managers till they got things working out how they want. Stop being delusional like changing managers is something bad. Arteta needs to go. STOP ACCEPTING SUCH MEDIOCRITY FFS.
DT admits that he might be wrong in backing Arteta right now. Simultaneously we have a ton of comments asking him to do just that. Yep. Braindead.
all you mugs forced wenger out now look where you are fighting for relegation
Wenger in?
The best manager in the world  said   “OZil can’t get in this team for footballing reasons”
Someone get me Inda ring with this guy right now !!!
As a chelsea fan sad to see how far they have come
Keep being deluded
In out in out you shake it all about....
DT’s high jump stats: Vs Everton: 0.5m  Vs Tottenham: 0.7m
QuQuestion of the day. Will Asenal ever leave 15 position in the premier league table?
Maitland niles did not keep richarlson quite!! So deluded
Nkiteah is not good enough btw welbeck doing good for England only
Aftv is the disease
What a pr*t. The only reason he’s rattled is because he knows if he flips he’s finished. 0 credibility
I finished watching the video. I think the only thing that will change this delusion is to extend Arteta contract. You wankers.   You made a mistake admit me and move on that is not hard. Arteta is a fraud.
This is DT best interview ever. Well said.
Arteta is confused and lack new tactics.Sack  him.
Arteta in (spurs fan)
Don't care if I'm saying it here but I'd rather listen to Curtis Shaw & Turkish.
It would make a difference changing the manager if you got a proper certified replacement like Allegri, but that's never going to happen.
We need new blood 🩸 and I reckon we need a English coach that knows the league that speaks the language 100%
This must be DT's first interview not shouting!!
Goffff
Why is it that it is only ex-footballers that manage teams. This is not so with NFL. Why can't someone like DT be made arsenal manager....??? His passion and love for the club is just incredible.
They got what they wanted they got wenger out now look were we are
Fulham 1-0 up
DT talks facts straight!
Robbie, do you interview DT coz of his lack of football analysis or coz he's just a two faced drama queen. The guy contradicts himself every freaking result...get a grip Robbie or I stop watching these. As an arsenal fan I've seen way better people on this, the cameraman has way better insights than DT
You said aaaages ago that the manager is always a scapegoat...and if it didn't work then it proves that the problem is the board and owners...and you're right...but arteta has to go.
You either die as a hero or live long enough to see yourself become arsenal
Deluded mate. Prepare for relegation. Liverpool today scored more games against palace than you lot in the last 11 games.
It doesn't matter who you support sometimes being a fan sucks. But at least for me I get to disappear for a bit but these guys don't. I feel for them and I'm a utd fan!!!!!
I believe that Arsenal will not be in this position in the second  half of the league but they need change. If I wasn't a Liverpool fan, I would have been an Arsenal fan. Change is inevitable from the top down to the bottom and Arteta isn't good enough! Nobody can tell me that Everton or Leicester players are good enough than what is in Arsenal, no they're not, this is a coaching problem. Arsenal areChampions league finalist, come on! Make a change and immediately!
Dt ‘ I’m a big boy ‘  -15:30 1 hour ago storms off a live like a baby
What a gd video to watch I loved that Mike L arteta in!!!!
We are really brainwashed because all the major signings were made on deadline day. Ozil partey etc. the board knows if they buy them early in the window fans will keep demanding for more players throughout the transfer period
Wenger Out!
If today didnt convince arteta needs to go then, well, not smart lol
Would upemacano or konate would want to play for this club 😭😭
Just admit you're wrong and Arteta needs to gtfo right now!!!
Think what you want about him but you cannot deny that Dt loves arsenal you can see how much he was drained in this video he was shattered and I dont blame him
We said last season that if we didn't have Auba then we'd be gone.... Well this is what happens when he's either not in form or there... in need for some serious changes. We can't just rely on  one person...
17 minutes long they aren’t playing games no more
Spurs supporter here; you need to bite the bullet, sack Arteta and get Poch at all costs, but you need to act NOW!!
Fair play DT. Reluctantly but surely you climbed down. Well done and head up! As a Liverpool fan I pray you guys don't get Rodgers as his style is similar to the great arsenal style your used to as he plays ticky tacky football with lots of passes and attacking intent!
As a Liverpool fan looking in I feel bad for Arteta. Even the most experienced manager would struggle with this sinking ship now imagine a new manager who is still learning and trying to keep the boat  afloat. Not even sure if Klopp could get this team to make top 4.
Get some professional help
Most of the players are to blame, that's true, at the same time who picks them up and sets them up, Arteta, it's hard to find a reason to back up the manager at the moment.  It's baffling how Willian is almost untouchable despite his lack of form, how Bellerin had a long run, it's hard to see how Nketiah is our striker, and I can continue, but is not about that, none of these players would be top choices at Leicester or Everton.  The final thought is this, let's say Arteta is backed and players are brought in the coming transfer windows, how confident are we that he and the board will choose the right players, given the profile of the players they continue to play
I wonder if Auba regrets signing da ting...
"WHENS IT GONNA END WOBBIE!"
Willian is Playing with shitty players, and hes 32 so what more do u expect, i guarantee you that with OZIL and two dms, willian and Pepe would find better spaces and make better runs with those passes but China is the reason Arsenal are in a relegation battle. Madness 😳
Hi. Arteta tried everything already what more he’s going to do mate. First team with his best players. Second best players and youngsters. Third and last chance tried more youngsters for UEFA Europa League. Nothing worked out for him. Now what ~ magic or what.
All this just prove's is your not as  bigger club then  you consistently  go on about.
The Best thing for Arsenal FC is to sell all the players who have big contracts. And start for the bottom with youth. They need to Create and develop the passion and what is means to play for this club. That can only happen with academy players. Would be a very hard and difficult thing to do.  But it's for the best and such a thing could take time These players now have no passion and drive . Do feel sad for arsenal fans
Sorry this disease you speak of, is Arteta. Clear your mind and you will see.
DT we have been saying everything you are saying about the club and you have not been listening?
Moment silence for DT mobile blower.
He has no attacking strategies. Get rid of him.
Who is getting replaced first DT phone or Arteta?
Bloody hell 17 minutes?! This has to be the longest fan cam ever!
Love Arteta but he ain't surviving this. The situation is just too much for any manager of his calibre
Imagine Aubameyang on Eddie’s chance
You ain’t beating Chelsea or city
ARSENAL DONT WORK ANYMORE NEEDS A DRAMATIC MAKE OVER.
All these players need to go in the recycling bin. COUNCIL need to come pick up these bin bags ASAP.
DT talking facts here, his best interview for sure
I DNT understand why you guys are not supporting ozil
Its a shame because id love to see Saka play around players who actually no what there doing...his a wasted talent in this squad right now
Sell out
Big up DT for being honest.
Even his phone can't survive Arsenals performances
Don Robbie saw £££ When DTs phone went flying
Well... Arsenal will be bottom 3 soon
Someone said if ole and lampard stay arsenal will get top 4 and now if arteta stay u lot will get relegated 😂😂
Dt u r a man child 😂 get a a grip son and i dont mean your mrs throat 😉
Leave these retro kits where they belong. Got man looking like a 90s fiend.
I'm a yid. DT should be your manager lol
Let's laugh at this loudmouth and talk big DT...HAHAHAHAHA
17 mins vid and this guy said nothing of value. Talks a lot but says little at the same time
Robbie just getting the bag before Arsenal become the next Sunderland
Carlo Ancelloti signed for everton on 21st Dec 2019 and everton are in top 2 position. Meanwhile, Arteta signed for Arsenal on 20th Dec. 2019 and we are number 15 in the table. That shows alot.
Arteta not repaying your faith doesn't necessarily mean you were wrong to back him
Made Iwobi look like Neymar
A football expert on AFTV once said   “We can’t get worst than Wenger”
Robbie when he seen DT throw the phone: 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Jamie Carragher: "Arsenal won't be worried about Tottenham or United tomorrow. They'll be worried about Fulham and Newcastle on the way home!"  🤣🤣
Willian doesn’t care
Damn, Let me get my dinner real quick.
Get rid of DT off AFTV pls big rob
ARTETA IS A BIG STRETCH OUT PUSSY TRYING ALL TYPE OF FUCKRY ARTETA OUT OUT OUT OUT NOW NOW
they havent had their contracts ripped up because they are , VERY LUCRATIVE CONTRACTS,,,go figure
I don’t know why arsenal fans want more players in. The priority has to be first getting most of that squad out the door. Awful
Bring mavropanos back from loan start playing Saliba for defensive options then sign a striker or an attacking midfielder
If people stop the talking crap for likes, and to be a YouTube celeb, - Speak the facts and truth and this Club might actually start to progress
Dt showing us to his phone what he does to his missis
go get lucien favre asap. he gets relegations side into top3. what u waiting for
DT actually makes a lot of sense , looking at the bigger picture and not only the manager who is also massively underperforming
The board, the players, and the kronki is the cencer. Not arteta
What is Dt's issue with Willian? Name one player that was on the pitch with a higher work rate than Willian? If Artea had played Willian in the middle instead of wide on the left instead of playing Cebalous you would have seen what you believe you should be getting from Willian. Look at the starting eleven, then look at the subs he brought on. Can you now see what the starting eleven could have, in fact, should have looked like? Arteta out, NOW!
Arteta determined to take Arsenal to the championship level 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Sack DT, embarrassing.
HE HAS ALREADY FLIPPED NOW HE STARTS TO FLOPP.......SO PREDICTABLE.
Arsene Wenger is available
I would 8-2 be an Arsenal fan right now 😂😂
I'm a yid and have to say I understand dt's passion and anger and also have to say he does call the game well at times be it for arsenal or the opposition!  Better than wheres the card ty
never seen DT Brocken like this...hope Arsenal sees the pain they give us
17 mins uno🤣
DT needs to rest...
What did Dts phone do to him🤣🤣 Apart from thousands of notifications from rival fans
The moment that we al waiting for
"When will it end Wobbie...."
In Arteta we trust 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Ah yes, the Christmas special of Arsenal Fan TV is finally here.
The word on his hat is so contradicting to what he did during the stream, gotta love DT!😂
Arsenal criticized Emery for playing the same players. Arteta does the same thing  Arsenal criticized Emery for terrible away form Arteta has terrible home AND away form   Arsenal criticized Emery for pragmatism Arteta sits deep against most teams  Mismanagement is still there.. STOP the bias!!
Your not a bad person DT , just an arsehole..🤩🤩🤩
Taking facts fir a change dt
Arteta has to go I feel sorry for him but he’s given up on his ethos of high pressing. This feels like Gary Neville at Valencia
Forget new signings I just want these current players out.
bad season
ARTETA IN- Sincerely, the rest of the league.
The owners have to  make changes.   If Arsenal gets relegated the intrinsic value of the club will  tumble and the revenues will substantially decrease   Priced Asset no more ?
The FA cup has definitely bought Arteta some more time on the job. I think he is not taking them anywhere. As a United fan I don’t trust our manager to take us anywhere but it looks like he’s doing ok than Arteta.
More trouble for Arsenal = more content for DT and AFTV, congratulations guys
Don Robbie really trying to buy his 5th Lambo 🤣🤔💰
The phone was a paid actor
Tottenham fan Keep arteta
When all else fails just blame bellerin tapas pulis in🤣
I love AFTV no disrespect
Giroud definitely scoring against us
Comparing eddie to kane and son wth the guys like 20
TY : players are still fighting  , I have 100% faith in Arteta
Like I said give Arteta 2 Seasons.
They seriously missed the boat with Sam Allerdyce going to WBA
LOOK AT YOUR PLAYERS NOT THE MANAGER, YOUR SQUAD REFLECTS YOUR LEAGUE POSITION, PEP COULDNT TURN THAT RUBBISH AROUND
Looks like hes smelt the coffee
Teams below arsenal know how to stay in the league.. they will fight for there epl life.. arsenal don't know how to do that.. sorry but you will be dragged right into this
Bringing in Edu was a massive mistake. I hate seeing legends come back to the club and messing up.
Ljungberg and Arteta are not experienced managers. Not even someone who has dealt with big players
Man I feel bad for Arsenal fans they don't deserve this they are a big club they use to every season fighting for the title now they are fighting for relegation I can't even believe that am saying that Arsenal are fighting for relegation
Ty: At least we won’t be in double digit defeats before Christmas
Big up DT
ARTETA IN ...... TROUBLE MATE 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought Its a backstage brawl between Robbie and dt
TRUST DI BUMBOCLART PROCESS DT CHILL MY G ARTETA IS GONNA SET UP THE CONES AND SCHOOL THESE KIDS HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL
Captain WengerOut got exactly what he asked for and he knows it.
Ty: I'm the most deluded fan DT: Hold my hat 🧢
Peak AFTV
DT is offically a Suicide candidate
DT has more broken phone screens than wins
Bring the arsenal we knew back
Hahahahaha love it when arsenal lose
Arteta broke DT’s phone
If it's harsh reality why is DT melding down on the same views aired?
Who would win fc Barcelona or Arsenal right now?
I belive they'll get top four if I'm honest...      Next year in the championship 😂🤣😂🤣 Expressions is a legend
Nketiah has nude pictures of Arteta. No other explanation.
HAHAHAHA, Pussio u we’re talking bare after beating utd whats wrong now?😂😂😂
Bring Ozil back
Were not going to win any game under arteta.wake up smell the coffee..get rid asap..
Fair play to DT , this interview is calm compared to the live stream
sky put up a stat, Willian has had 1 shot on target in 11 pl games
DT turning slowly into TY
Arteta is a fraud. Stop commenting on players.
it always to the left *(20) ..Pepe all he does is chase back to help his RB..Pepe gets the ball in bad positions where he can`t take on people..the team is setup for saka to shine..and it is killing then team because the goal we score is when saka does something which never happens..if it happens, it happens once in 10 games
Arteta out for sure 👍 this time
COME ON YOU RAT ARMY!!!!!
I can't believe the same Willian who was turning it on for Chelsea is a flop for arsenal... That was fast
but... But... He won the FA tea cup and the Community Saucer Shield, deserves at least 15 years to turn it around, so what if we get relegated?
Willian was one of our best players at Chelsea for the past 5 years!!! If he's dead at arsenal then I must say somethings wrong with arsenal not willian
Once again Arteta got his tactics and his subs all wrong
I can't trust Arteta with the January window... he will continue to flop. He should be managing in League 2 not one of the top 3 clubs in the UK
I think they should give him the benefit of the doubt until the January window and take a positive that Gab Martineli is back and Saka is playing well
You’re alright DT, passion gets the best of us sometimes
DT would've killed wenger if this happen under him
Last time it was drop lacca for the young kids  Now young kids ain't  good enough why is lacca not starting!! Idiots make your mind up !!!!!!
"imma big boy" - DT, 2020 lmao
Well he already lost ozil
After watching the full fan cam. I have realised that dt is man enough to accept his mistakes (backing Arteta). So yeah, dt is to not deluded like ty.
ARTETA HAS NOT ONLY LOST THE PLOT, BUT IS ALSO TOTALLY OUT OF HIS DEPTH AS OUR MANAGER, AND APPEARS TO HAVE LOST OUR DRESSING ROOM ALTOGETHER!!! 😙😙😙 IF WE WERE TO SOMEHOW CONTINUE WITH HIM TILL THE END OF THE SEASON, WE WILL GET RELEGATED FOR CERTAIN!!! 😳😳😳😳😳
You think you felt pain. Just imagine how DT’s iPhone feeling now
His cap says ' Behave ' LOL   Of course these players don't  care, would you on 100,000 + a week!
I swear five more minutes in that interview and DT would have cried.😂😂
DT in 2025 after Arsenal lose 3-0 to Wrexham in League One: “Mikel Arteta is the man to get us back to the Championship”
arteta always diss laca
Welcome to Turkish’s world.
When is it going to end Wobbie
This is what you get for hounding out Arsene Wenger shame on the lot of you and I'm a utd fan
I'm soooo happy to see you lot suffering it's a joy to watch, you got your manager sacked and now you enjoy what you wished for 👌
I’m not keen on the guy but credit for coming out for this after his tantrum
Think DT needs to start utilising the behaviour that is on his hat.
DT:  ...Like I said....
Finally DT points to the obvious
This is a really sad state of affairs .. "Wenger Out" they said... When All Wenger needed was financial backing
Ozil must be laughing his ass off
Love to see DT cry.
aye wobbie
Welcome back dt lol
The last game won was a penalty against Manchester United.  😂🤣😅 be happy and sweet on Thursday nights, sad and depressed on the weekend 🤪
Man up DT
willian is chelsea thru n thru. he dnt fkn care abt arsenal. arteta beggn him and ceballos to play
This guy is trying to use the guilt trip about him being wrong but was calling people who knew Arteta isn’t the guy rats.. Ok
Cry baby 😭
Humble(d)
Terrible
It seems like AFTV flip flops about who should play or not at games. Eddy was needed last time as young blood to revitalise the team and Laca to bench, now it's Laca in Eddy on the bench. The sad story is the team by the name of Arsenal Football Club is a big name but players aren't good enough to carry the name
🎶 So f*** off AFTV, you even signed Thomas Partey! You're going down down down! 🎶
Arsenal fans deserve what we’re getting. We have the worst fans in the whole world.   Arsenal fans turned on and hounded out the most loyal and most successful manager in their history because making top 4 was not good enough.   They didn’t realize he was the only high level person at the club that actually loved the club and actually had a football brain.   Now see where we are.   Good for all those Wenger Out fans.   I just pray we don’t get relegated because it is a very real possibility at this point.
Stan kronke is my hero 🤩🤩
Ty: Iwobi tricked Holding into thinking he was still playing for Arsenal. Iwobi you’re a cheat, I hope Everton get relegated.
And DT you wanted  Wenger out , what a fool
Arsenal have almost outspent Spurs every season and manage to always finish in a Europa league spot
This ain’t even bants no more this is real pain I had to watch invincible highlights to remind me y I support this club 😭
arteta diggn his own grave. he needs a goal  he  brings on laca with  10 mins to go WTF.
Please arteta out
You moved to the Emirates to compete with  Bayern ❌ Burnley ❌ Bradford ✅
the solution is simple is to bring allegri ...
DT is always blaming the wrong person. It’s the manager! Does Leeds have better players? Does Wolves have better players? Do Saints have better players?
Yeah blame stan kroenke when you all were saying that you had a better transfer window than spurs.
Dt has found his phone on the floor more times than arsenal have wins this month in the premier league.
DTs Phone saying in heaven “at least I don’t need to watch arsenal anymore”
DT, I heard the T is short for TY.
Robbie after every arsenal loss: 🤑
I'm loving this! Imagine arsenal in the championship. We'll laugh at that for 100 years.
DT phone has to suffer coz of Arteta😏
This loss is brought to you by ETORO
RTETA HAS MADE THIS JOB IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIMSELF. HE FORCED THE BEST PLAYERS OUT AND KEPT THE PLAYERS HE LIKES. WHICH ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. HLL DIE BY HIS UNFAIR DECISIONS. SAD THING IS HZ BN ALLOWED TO TAKE THE CLUB DOWN WITH HIM
Everyone wanted Arsene gone. What's that quote again? You don't know what you have till its gone lol
Bring Wenger back it’ll be good for everyone.
Just waiting for tys interview now!
I wanna know what screen protector dt was using
Arteta Out
Once again no arsenal goals in free play 😂
Robbie: how aren’t we in a relegation battle??! TY: well we must forget about ratios, 15/20 is 3/4, we’re still in the top 4 fight!
Honestly....what will bringing in a new manager change? In comes a new manager, same lack of investment from the owners, same problems, so then we all call for new manager, same lack of investment from the owners, same problems, so then we all call for a new manager, same lack of investment from the owners, same problems and on and on and on and on it goes, new manager, lack of investment from the owners, same problems,  nothing will ever change at Arsenal while kroenke is in charge of this club, until kroenke goes we will never compete again.... ever
DT's screen protector defended better than Arsenal 😂😂
Bring in Allegri
DT the Diva is SHATTERED
Keep in mind that thats someones parent, wearing a behave hat and smashing his phone because of a suerchat.
Agent Willian doing bits rn 😭😭😭😭😭 can’t believe Arsenal fans thought they’d get good performances from him
Well done DT take a big man. To come out to thousands of people and say it looks like you was wrong about arteta. At the end of the day wrong or right you’re entitled to an opinion.
Dt will never say Arteta out cos his delusional and an arrogant manchild. Cos he went balls deep on Arteta is this and that he can’t swallow his pride simple
Charlton 3 - 1 Arsenal | Arteta will get us back in The Championship (DT)
He nearly broke his Rag n Bone
Next match vs Chelsea🙂😀
DT is saying laca needed to start because of his experience... what about last week when they were saying get the young lads out instead 😂
AFTV has become a business with it's board of directors. I used to look forward to the after match, not any more. And that's not just because we are going through a bad spell, I think the whole concept needs a serious overhall. I back Arteta and I back Robbie, but you can't stand still and just milk the cows.
The only reason they are not sacking Arteta is that they haven't bscked the way he wanted
IM ONLY HUMAN AFTER ALL IM JUST A MAN DO WHAT I CAN DONT PUT THE BLAME ON ME DONT PUT THE BLAME ON ME
DT SOOOooo Calm👌
DT throwing things around because he put all his eggs in the Arteta basket and that has flopped miserably and now he doesn’t want to seem wrong so keeps saying he backs the man. He’s a fool, Arteta is a championship manager
At least we can now rule out Xhaka and Bellerin are not the only problem
This man needs to apologize to Wenger
Bottom line.....only 5 of our senior players are good enough,Teirney,Partey,Gabriel,Leno & Auba.......Holding,Chambers,Sokratis,Kalosinac,Bellerin,Xhaka,Elneny,Ozil,Lacazette,Willian all need to go. END OF!
DT has given up
STILL BEING AS DELUSIONAL AS EVER DT.....CARRY ON NOW!!!
"When is it going to end Robbie"---DT
Absolute clown of a man....can scream, swear and verbally assault players and people but one criticism of something he actually said and he slings his phone n storms of like a child......mans a pathetic and in future  ends to keep his mouth shut critiquing bellerin n others
Welcome to the dark Side DT.. U have joined the Rats... 🤣🤣
Willian was the signing of the season
Here comes the start of the switch 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🥲 and fans actually believe this fraud
Not to mention Ozil and Saliba
Well done for admitting you are wrong 👍🏽
WOBBIE!!!
DT is a broken man 😆😆
Lets bring in a world class manager and then you can talk about the disease
DT 16TH 😂🖕🖕🖕
You alright now DT 🤣
Balogun nelson smith rowe are in top form yet pur idiot of manager wont play him instead eddie willian holding are playing
‘Willian is better then Ziyech’ Robbie 2020
FC BANTER
Welcome Allegri
DT saw how great life could be after drinking out of Ty’s water bottle last week 🤣 back to reality
Surprised no arsenal player got sent off
IT'S TIME TO GO
DT scapegoating at the earliest chance he gets. It’s the entire team and it’s to big of a job for Arteta
Holy mother of midroll ina a 17 minute video
Hahahaha prat in a hat slowly swallowing his pride and seeing this fraudulence 😂😂😂😂 keep backing him mate 😀
Before wenger out and now championship football in ARSENAL FC
Is DT’s phone okay?
keep faith in arteta🤣🤣 hes the best manager in arsenals history we all love him🥰😍🥰😘🥰😘🥰😍🤣😂🤣😂
Clearly arteta and louis have issues, Holding enjoys that with an armband
This guy really think he’s a big deal
waaahh waahh big baby dt wants his sippy cup 😂😂😂😂😂
Robbie said we lost every game in December, actually we draw against Southampton, but does not change anything, just a correction.
I like when players (like Tierney) or fans (like DT) show their frustration, sorry we are not all as diplomatic as Churchill....
Deal With It
Fair play to DT though admitting he was wrong and over reacted
Teams just let us have the ball Cos we can’t create anything.  Arteta will bang on about crosses and possession again but we ain’t creating changes or scoring goals !!   Goals win matches !!
If mikel has any love for Arsenal he resign
Ty: at least we scored a crucial away goal
Everyone get rid of Wenger... since then I see no one better then him.
That idiot will pay for Ozil's treatment..
Fair play for acknowledging that Arteta may not be the answer
Since November 1st, 50% of Arsenals premier league goals have been penalties. (2)
As a lfc fan... look ill do you gunners a favour... if you pay me for my channel.. ill dedicate a whole career season on fifa for you and win everything.... ill help you out your misery.
“It’s all passion” no, this bloke has a massive anger problem, clearly the type of guy who lets the results rule his whole week, just bizarre behaviour repeatedly from him.
Fairplay to DT after this interview
Asked for Wenger to go and look at what you’ve got in return! You only have to blame yourself DT
DT Kardashian :)
We need to pray hard no cure can handle this
Anyone else waiting for Ty’s video?
What did this MAN CHILD say?? Did he finish the interview or he raged again?
U are the biggest flip flop goin and can't back down now clown
Every Arsenal fan is hurting badly. It's  time to go Arteta. We can't  take it anymore.
I can already see DT in his player ratings for Willian saying “0, he gets a 1 for putting his shirt on the right way, what’d you want me to say Robbie!!?”
What’s with the copy&paste comments
We are turning into Leeds when they were relegated - they waited until it was too late.
Dt Phone life matters 😂😂
Your hard smashing your phone 🤣🤣🤣 mind the gap big boys
Willian is dogshit. Strolling about the pitch constantly. I love it!!
Remember when he came on the football terrace and was laughing at other clubs I won't say rivals coz their rivals are Fulham Sheffield westbrom Brighton and them man
Robbie only happy because he doesn't need to buy him new phone ......
London in tier three lockdown dt.  Even if you get. New manager tomorrow he’s quarantined lol
You can tell he's so embarrassed... if he's doing this on a livr imagine behind closed doors 😂
whats happening to this great club
Maitland-Niles was dreadful. Was as effective defending as DT holding his anger!
Rag'N Bone man needs to get real  now, Arteta's time is OVER
It’s actually gotten to the point now where I’d be more surprised if Arsenal won a game rather than lose one. 😭
A wise man once said:ITS TIME TO GO!!!!
Arteta broke DT & his phone. What a manager!
Just to say, I'm a spurs fan, but I love Robbie, been watching for the past month, subscribed, so much respect for his demeanor and patience
DT-Y
Willian foreskin
It really hurts to see Iwobi, a player we let go, have an amazing game against us.
This is genuinely the most sense you’ve spoken in ages DT fair play
think of changing the players the  same old players that has let all managers down, I don't see no movements, defence has that ball but  no movements in front of them. no one taking  up the spaces Willian is not working hard enough for the team. pepe takes too long to make a decision on the ball I am not sure what these guys do in training. i still think it's not the manager,  it's  not as easy to beat us as before.  but midfield is poor they don't creat or link the play. some contracts should be terminated at the club,  balogon should at least be on the bench
Vote your favourite quote 1When is it gonna end 2Not good enough 3Take your time with it 4Back again 5Let the partey begin 6Trust the process 7Arteta in 8Arteta out
Damn 17minutes
aftv have turned into a soap opera, every week I wait for another episode always leave me on the edge
Biggest manchild going
We took wenger for granted those last seasons. It has gone downhill ever since
German coach 😁😁😁🤝🤝🤝
That supercaht was the 💣
Ahhh DT (Deluded Toddler) back again! Man rattled by a £2 superchat from ‘ManChild’ 😭 you can’t script this gold even if you wanted to!
Things might change when arsenal install a manager that makes the fans go WOW . Not managers that they can get on the cheap .
Last week and the week before it was bellerin now willian...who’s next? When’s it arteta ?
This is the same guy that's been making up his own stats and facts for weeks. Claiming Liverpool were 15th under Klopp at the same stage (they were 2nd). But then cries when some random kid calls him out on a superchat. What a huge buffoon 😂😂😂
You need allegri now
Haha love when arsenal lose. Absolute shower of wankers cheering and saluting when they score and then breaking down mentally when they lose! Haha enjoy the championship next year
DT's soooo cocky by the first chance that appears. Sweet to see him humiliated.
Just let me down for a big acc ... the players are not trying just going through the motions
Have a go at arteta all you want but by the end of January window you’ll still have bottom 10 team, yeah he could probably do a bit better but the quality in your team compared to teams like wolves now you can’t even compete for europa league.
Well,now Arsenal can play in Championship. It's close to champions league.
These r the same guys who if laca played n didn't perform would say why not give a chance to Eddie ... Hilarious 🤣
Dt better say it.
This guy is 40 years of age you wouldn’t think it.
It really hurts
Thats the thing, if that was them showin more effort and this is them showing fite as a team then this is more worrying if that's the output. They had a north London derby against Spurs n that was the out put n the other performances too. they showin poor levels and if that's the best they going to give or can the manager can't do it.
Hate to say it dt has become more deluded than ty how cna he still back the manager when there is no improvement
DT threw his phone better than Bellerin does with his football.
William came to Arsenal to draw is pension
Arteta bombaclaat OUT, GET THE HELL OUT TA RAARSE. Man like Bellerín, Lacazette, Willian, Sokratis, Maitland-Niles, David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi, Özil, Elneny, Chambers, Joe Willock, Reiss Nelson, Smith Rowe, Mavropanos, Torreira, Eddie Nketiah, Sead Kolašinac, Saliba, Ceballos, Rob Holding, and definitely Granit ducking Xhaka Deport them all of them all of them out out. Thierry Henry for arsenal manager Berkemp as his assistant Marc Overmars for technical director and Wrighty as fan liaison!!!..
I like how he just blames William not even going to blame other shite 10 players on that pitch...
We are gonna tear arsenal a new one and evict them from London come the 26th 😂🖕🏽
did anyone go check on dt mrs yet?
Ty:Mikel used to play for Everton therefore we won
This is the true heirs to the muppet show
Agent Willian is doing great!:D
Soon enough, DT FC will be playing in a higher division than Arsenal
DT going to murder someone tonight
Me listening to DT but wondering what Zah will be standing on this week🤔😂
Hey lost his cool.. It's fine.. We are all humans... Some people are more reactive and sensitive then others.. As long as he is a good person to his friends and family who are we to judge
DT is gradually  becoming DTy
Arsenal fans NEVER learn to stop bantering Utd when they catch a bit of form. Then Utd finished 3rd last season above them, and now Utd are closer to fighting for the title while Arsenalnare fighting relegation. These man was cussing Ole and Lampard to now have egg on their faces AGAIN haha mugs. Humble yourself Arsenal fans you'll forever be in Utds shadow no matter how bad they are at the time.
Nice Jacket DT trust the process mate 👍
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA BANTER CLUB
More waffle than the politicians running this country 😴
17 minutes. Don Robbie has delivered
if arsenal get relegated most the players will leave cuz players will be approached by other clubs cuz it must be so embarrassing playing in the championship
i want a dt rant interview
Im “hurting” because he broke his iphone 11 i wanted it 😂😂😂🤣🤣.
We are in a relegation dogfight! The only thing I ask is that the players show a little of the passion that DT has for the club
Just remember a deluded man once said        Arteta broke Klopp 🤣🤣
Why do people think we gonna sell and buy players in january? Everyone knows it is hard to buy and sell players. This isnt Football Manager, we have to sell 2 players to bring in 1.
Arteta and half of Arsenal are simply not good enough
17 minutes.😂 This about to be good
We have Chelsea two days b4 my birthday and I'm not looking forward to it
If it wasn’t for DT, I think most people would probably feel bad for arsenal fans
DT needs to stop comparing Emery to arteta ones a winning manager the others a coach
No red cards, no Xhaka no Bellerin, no Mustafi.  It’s the process though
Is this a podcast or something
DT is such a crybaby. Should be hard being his friend. Gets mad over everything. He's gotta grow up. Too childish for a bald man
If you are a big club like you think you are, arteta needs to go
Hook it to my veins 😆😂😂😂   Championship 2021 lads. 🙌😂😂
DT needs to stop talking about other clubs. Every single time he opens his mouth he ends up getting it back in return x100. Focus on your own club.
I guess their wasn’t any thing wrong with Troopz’s mom tea.
DT: Arteta broke Kloop @Junior 18: Well,i'll make u break yr phone then🤣🤣🤣
Calm down you lot, he's interesting  and brings in the views
Arteta broke Klopp
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m very curious to see this madness that Arsenal fans think they’re gonna do in January. Maybe I’m not informed enough but besides Aubameyang when have Arsenal ever done a ‘madness’ in January?
Spine of the team today: Holding-Elneny-Nketiah. Nothing more to say.
Was this a counselling session?
I feel exactly how DT feels Sick and tired of seeing the club I love, lose!
Karma for ARSENE WENGER
From a neutral position (lfc fan) can it be possible that mikel is purposely savataging the squad at this point? He's maybe seen how bad it is with the board and hes saying sack me and ill collect my wages. Eddie over laca? How is that possible.  Just a thought
All this plank ever does is compare arteta to emery
I want to back you DT but Arteta is not the answer now. The board is clueless and they are not taking  the decisions needed. We need wholesale changes. Board, manager and players.
DT's response to that superchat tells you everything you need to know about him.
Man's blood pressure and stress levels must be hugely dangerous atm.
GAT DAMN 17 MINUTES ..BUT THAT DT PHONE THROW RAGE WAS FUNNY AF..the superchat wasnt even being extra or anything he just LOSTIT
You have to back your manager???? To where... The championship??
A wise man once said, there is no use having a mind if you can't change it!!!
DT, it's obvious you're letting emotions control you. You had no emotional connection to Emery and so you wanted him gone (which was probably fair). Face it, if a manager who isn't an ex-player was getting these results and in this form, you'd be going round his house with a torch and a crowbar. You've got caught up in the hype of ex-players coming back and you want it to work more than you want Arsenal to succeed. The reasons why are unclear but you're not supporting Arsenal, you're supporting the manager. And in this current state, it's making you look more and more foolish by the day.   But what do I care, it's funny.
Arterta out and boris out!!
DT looks like he smoked a spliff to chill before this
This is not good
Literally thinks he’s the hardest geeza in the world
Don’t blame Arteta “ he has only got 4 good players, they should give him the team he needs, you can’t plant corn and reap peas”””
I wanna ask Troopzs mum if she's still Wenger in
Robbie thinks they lost every game in December even though they literally drew  their last home game ffs
Here before 1m views
Robbie loves when DT acts like this.. he’s just thinking all those views 💰
Few months it was Arteta Master Class. Now the same Arteta Master Flop Class
Holding captain arsenal? We are in bigger mess than I thought!
I’m trying to ring DT but it keeps going to voicemail.
Wobbie just end it.
enough with eddie starting i have seen lacazete missing better chances this season
Robbie needs to sort out this manchild soon.
You should have got Allardyce
Only thing dt is right about is Eddie how is he playing for arsenal
THIS PLATFORM NEEDS TO START PUSHING KRONEKE OUT. UNTIL THIS OWNER STOPS BEING ABSENT FROM THIS CLUB WE WILL NEVER GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE. KRONEKE OUT NOT ARTETA OUT.
MANCHILD
DT should change his ring tone to baby shark..      When he gets a new phone lol
Hate seeing DT like this but Arteta is a lost cause. He  can't motive the players to perform anymore nor is he picking out the best team. Why persist with a manager when results keep getting worse each week?
Usmanov majority share holder for Everton probably laughing at Kronke right now.
Ty:  Salah 13 goals arsenal 12 goals and Son 11 goals so relax robbie we're still in contention for golden boots and arteta top with 7 red cards.
Trust the "RELEGATION" process
I saw holding as a captain 🤦🏿‍♂️ am sorry arteta out
DT is basically a white Ty now
Dt has lowered arsenals standards ironically he was blaming Wenger for lowering the standards because he was getting top 4 lol
We him hes joke
Dt you can ask Santa for a new phone
Robbie "asking the same questions every week" Lyle
Deluded rat 😡😡
If you see this go report @CFC_RAF on twitter
You better enjoy this. This is the best aftv is gonna get
I dont care what manager we have, nobody will get a run of results with these clowns
TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT 😂
His team selection and subs must be killin' the players. Willock as the first sub!? Taking Pepe off and leaving Willian on!? WTF? Why is Elneny, Willian, etc. even playing!?
Amn should be playing box to box like his mum
Dt a clown 🤣
DT is just not honest today now his hitting on William!!!! Last week was xhaka and bellerin, this week it nketiah and William next week it will be Luiz and cebalos , the coach make the key decision with Ozil he will need to take the blame now, DT is not a God , he just giving opportunity to express himself, arteta out!!!! No tactics  No plan B We need to start a match playing like we want to win !!! Not playing we want to score after opponent scoring us  Arteta it over bro  Why not putting in Rowe when we need some creativity
@AFTV Allegri IN or Viera IN RIGHT NOW !!!
UNFOLLOW ALL OFFICIAL ARSENAL SOCIAL MEDIA THEY DONT DESERVE OUR SUPPORT
DT to smash his kids Christmas presents up in anger
Arteta can't pull the strings any more
Arteta's broke DT
DT the man-child, can't admit when he's wrong... good entertainment for us though
Fulham winning hahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahhqhahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahah
This is so f*cking embarrassing
Willian cost us nothing but he’s costing us everything - a wise mane once side
DT SHOULD LEARN TO TAKE CRITICISM IT WOULD DO HIM WELL
Finally, DT my Man is seriously beginning to reason like the DT he is.
I seriously don't like Football anymore!
Big baby
@AFTV Arteta OUT NOW !!! Edu OUT NOW !!!
THE MANCHILD. GETTING EVERYTHING HE DESERVES IN RETURN FOR GETTING WENGER OUT
DT shouldn't be hurting at all bcos he loves Arteta.
In any way shape or form
DT mate you need stop getting so emotional and admit you've made a mistake , there will always be trolls but I guarantee you'll earn the respect of a lot of people if you can admit you are in the wrong for once .
Clueless manager, Spineless set of players. If things dont change and quick we will be in a relegation fight
Not an Arsenal fan but the channel is compulsive viewing.
I’m hurting, not as much as DT’s phone though 😂
17 minutes???!! This gonna be good 🍿
Thing is, Ty stood by Wenger and said he can still lead the team. Yet they're worse without wneger, they're proving Ty that he was right. That is rock bottom
DT is a man child
The face of a man who’s team lost and has to replace his phone screen
Rag n Bone man in the mud
Ty: Well Arsenal scored 3 goals altogether today which is more than in recent weeks so that’s a massive positive.
Seeing this level of anger I worry for his family... from now on I have taken it upon myself to ensure we don’t see sign of physical abuse such as bruises on his knuckles
DT is the Xhaka of AFTV
were screwed I'm I arsenal fan and this is a mess, the club is in freefall right now
I'm sure DT's phone has seen some crazy things in it's time hahahahaha
🍿
Arteta does for managers what Shipman did for GPs
4:07 take your time with it as you guys once said
Ty: the cold temperature affected our players feet
Open your eyes dt how can you tolerate with being in 15th???
Dt : Arteta in I bet
When's it gonna end WOBBIE
Time to buy a CAT phone, fam
“ARE WE GONA EVEN MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS THIS YEAR ROBBIE??? LOSING TO PRESTON NORTH END ITS NOT GOOD ENOUGH”
No one: DT do you love Arteta? DT: I am hulkkkkk!😠😠
😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video is brought to you by arteta relegating arsenal
DT , if you care about Arteta sign him for DT fc . We care about our football club
Arteta winning the FA Cup is what caused all this delusion.
My response to DT is the same as the former AFTV legend who shall not be named: "ITS TIME TO GO!!!!!!"
I think if we give him a opportunity on January he’ll mess it all up and that will lead to our relegation so it’s risky to keep our manager
I've been waiting for this one
the man child arises
when you make fun of the showtime reds thats what happens fella
We joke about ty being deluded. Now we got DT lol
Ty: we lost so that all non arsenal fans could have an earlier christmas present. We are a classy club
🎶 Going down going down going down🎶
R.I.P DT's phone, plummeted to relegation faster than Arsenal😂
Everton 2-1 Arsenal | I'm In A Daze & Hurting After DT Threw Me! (DT's Phone)
What a great ending to 2020. Merry Christmas boys!
He literally did it to himself, he fell for the new manager bounce, talked Arteta up to be a young Guardiola, now he’s been found out and DT can’t handle people calling him out on it
Sack the male model 😂😂
It hurts, Robbie 😭
Another Atletico win, another arsenal loss.     Thomas Partey isn’t having a Partey 😭😭
The one match with clear cut chances and Aubemyangs injured.
Surely Arsenal won't get relegated😂😂😂
DT=Deluded Tom
RIP DT's phone
Is coming flip flop dt arteta out
@AFTV DT "when's it gunner END robbie ???"
Rip dt phone
big up the guy that sent the super chat in calling DT out
DT is a clown. He’s becoming worse than Ty with his delusion
The FA Cup and Community shield raised this fan base's expectations. Arteta said from the onset he won't do magic. The club has gone downhill since 2007, this the AFTERMATH. Kroenke OUT.
Worst manager in arsenal history sadly the stats don’t lie
Violence is never the answer bro 😂
Throwing a phone isn’t being passionate it’s acting like a 5 year old kid who didn’t get a sweet refuse to believe he’s a grown man
Here we go ladies and gents the moment we have all been waiting for
Robbies new private jets just been ordered
Arsenal since the beat united. 7 games 5L 2D only Sheffield Utd have a worse record in that period 😂 United are top by the way
DT sitting in silence during the stream, knowing he’s messed up massively by backing Arteta.
DT has dictators mentality take what I said and don't argue with me
DT throwing a strop and storming off was maximum derrick
“Willian is signing for the biggest club in London” DT 😂😂😂
Agent Willian f*** arsenal  Relegation team All you can SYM  Robbie you’re alright
Arteta reminds me of Garry Neville at Valencia. First time manager, well spoken and great ideas....but didn't work out.  Arsenal need to get a proven manager. Hiddink for the short term, perhaps?
I think the situation we are in right now we need an experienced manager
17 mins       Really is Christmas
DT too scared to say he got it wrong
17 mins long😱 naaa lemme get my drink n popcorn
DT: We lost because ‘Willians Sponge Head’ got in the way of our shots
Our league position should be a non-negotiable. How Arteta can keep his job is beyond me
Been waiting for this , how’s the phone 😂😂😂
Deluded Fan might be gaining sense after all
Take your time with it, trust the process, arteta in.
My mom is arteta in. is she mad
And ty they arsenal is good hahaha
ArTiTa's oNlY hUmAn AfTeR aLl       DoNt pUt ThE bLaMe oN hIm
Robbie is a gentleman, he didn’t take it personal, he is a professional and he did his job. Big up man. Arteta in, I am enjoying every bit of these reactions 😂 from a United fan
DT u make me laugh
Dt needs to remove that 'Behave' hat ASAP. Has never behaved in his life time
Aftv is more entertaining then watching arsenal play.
Question - is  LWLLWLDLLLDL   A/ a village in the Rhondda valley  B/ Arsenal’s last 12 premier league results .
You are not hurt the club is in this mess because you backed the process and abused those who told you from day 1 that arteta is crap
DT derseves this for telling us for a year to "Trust the process" 👍🏽
I'm only Human after all - DT
get him off ffs
DT two week ago: Arteta need to take 10/12 points from the next 4 games or he should leave..  3 games later Arteta is 1/9
Hahahqh amateur club
Ty: No red cards today so we have to take the positives
Where’s your banner now DT  “Thanks for the memories”
Robbie always trying to sugar coat. About we showed fight. We’re losing week in week out!
He won't admit he is wrong. And when Arteta IS sacked he'll just say 'well I backed him more than anyone but it was his time to go.' Calling it now.
DT: Arteta is only human after all
Dt: When is it gonna end robbie Dt : 2025
Robbie is manipulative, and plays the innocent devils advocate card.
DT deserves this more than anyone else
DT having sleepless nights over that comment
I like DT but hes actually being more delusional than Chris and TY who he called out years ago. And we were better then
Press F to pay respects for DT’s Phone.
Just hold up your hands bro. No shame in admitting defeat
Oh of course he was gonna come back. Anything for views and clicks, basking in the clubs failure.
There's nothing wrong in now coming out and admitting that arteta ain't the right guy, people can back something and it just don't work
MAN CHILD
Anyone got a spare phone for Dt ? He won't be able to get one from cex anymore
Good ebening. If only Arsenals defence was as strong as his phone screen!
DT: "Maybe im foolish maybe im blind maybe i need a new phone right now"
DT this season is turning into D-Ty.
arsenal FC will get alan pardew in january 😛 bc west brom already snatched big sam the relegation specialist
This club is destroying DT’s mental health for real. Even as a United fan I feel sorry for him.
Poor DT I feel your pain bro.
when is it gonna end wobbie
Let’s all laugh at Arsenal 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dt in the mud 😂😂😂😂
Ty: No red cards today which is a good result
Arteta in... i mean he's only human after all.
DT better not beat anyone after what he did to his phone...
"when's it gonna end Robbie"
*WHENS IT GOING TO END ROBBIE!!!*
Leave him alone, guys. He’s only human after all
DT you're back?the way u leave that room i think you would be in the Caribbean already!!!!
DT is in a tough spot: Will get trolled for backing the manager and will get trolled for wanting him out
shoutout to guy that send that superchat
Keep making the Arteta and Klopp comparisons lmao. Arteta's name shouldn't be in the same sentence as Klopp
Who is the man child going to scapegoat now Xhaka and Bellerin didn't play?
DT: Arteta can win the championship
Alright brother, come hang out with me next week. Bring Hector.
Robbie when is this going to end?
Not sure if DT will be able to watch this later when he gets home on his phone.......
17 mins? Thts a show
Buckle up guys tonight is gonna be PROPER AFTV and chill prime time 🍿
Ahhhh Christmas is here early, let's all kick back, have a nice glass of champagne as we watch DT moan in misery, merry Christmas folks!
Has he fixed up yet, get him of the show, ego is to big
"This video is brought to you by ARTETA IN "  🤣🤣🤣
DTs the kind of guy to say I told you auba will have a shot today and make out he’s some sort of genius for predicting it , the amount of times he says “ what did I say “
Ah yes the Arsenal we all know and love!
TY: "Rob Holding, You're a cheat!!! and I hope you get relegated!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DT cant even go out and get his new phone now it's tier 4
DT in 2025: I still believe Arteta is the man to get us out of league one
DT just needs to admit the obvious
arsenal are going to get divorce from premier league
Still trusting the process??
A wise man once said: “It’s time to go”
DT and Robbie now what they are doing😃😃..For the views yoh gang bussines
DT getting angry over some child calling him that explains his mentality.
Appointing Arteta over Ancelotti has got to be the most delusional, arrogant brainless decision by any board.
DT too proud to accept defeat. Sad
RIP DT PHONE
again arsenal will finish 50 point behind liverpool. already 20 point
can dish it out but can't take it
Artetain..😂
If Wenger was here with this happening Arsenal fans would have pitch forks and fire sticks demanding he be sacked. If Emery was here with this happening they’d want his head on a stick. Arteta should never have been manager.
DT is deluded
Deluded DT
He’s a total embarrassment, guy thinks he’s something special cause he shouts the loudest he’s nothing without Robbie show some respect.
Well you are the same man who said with your chest that Arteta broke Klopp and that he's better than both Lampard and Ole. You are the same man who has been telling us to trust an imaginary process and back him when YOU know he's out of his depth. You deserve everything you are getting at the moment.
Why does DT keep looking down like he’s got a phone in his hand😂😂
“IT’S TIME TO GO”😤
Ty: I am deluded. DT: Hold my beer 🍺
Dt breaking lockdown rules to get a new phone as we speak
Ty- Holding thought Iwobi was still playing for us
This feels familiar 😂😂😂
Arsenal gonna get relegated 🤣
Get the popcorn guys
A moments silence for DT’s phone 🙏
Manchild DT
First
