❤zach looks beautiful with that wig
22:57 aged like milk...
4:52 You should love God more than anything.
Eugene: "Straight people are crazy." Me: "Yep."
Keith is the whole reason I come back to this video
35:20 sacks gown is a better bell ngl ❤🔔
Ffs start using proper English. GIRLS don’t get married. WOMEN do. Stop referring to women as girls.
Should be white? Why?
I like the elvian and the black one best
Rewatching this years after Ned’s lil dilemma came out and boy did that not age well 😂 4:52
Keith's dress is great for the bride who is having a shotgun wedding.
While I 1000% agree that you had the right to go first on that elevator, like you said in the first part, no one’s more important than others so TECHNICALLY she didn’t have to give it to you even though it’s the right thing to do
Well this ........ aged
Watch my big fat american gypsy wedding see their wedding bresses
As a LOTR fan who hasn’t cheated on their significant other…we don’t know him…
He should’ve mentioned that he had done mostly hand stitching for that top part. I feel like if I were a judge that would garner extra points.
Honestly love both the guest judges. They seem so down to earth, despite the kind of people they worked with
30:39 The banana nibble😂😂😂
I can't wait to be old enough to shop at Chicos.   I'm 37.  I'm not too far away.
I love how Zach got in there when they were taking photos 😂❤️
I love them all….except one👀…but I do love how Eugene is just about amazing at everything. I also love how he admittedly is very Type-A, as am I and most times we can’t allow ourselves to be any less then as perfect as we can be🤦🏼‍♀️
32:24 the banana toss and catch 😂😂😂
Eugene's is incredible
27:55 the way zach walks over has me WEAK
Omg I love Eugene’s dress ❤
Can we bring this back 😫 😩 😭
I never knew I needed Eugene to plan my wedding until now
28:49 DiNg dOnG
"N*d is way too in his element today" funny, when this video was new I thought it was a wedding dress video not a cheating on your wife with a significantly younger employee video
32:27 the banana catch though🤌🏽
This is my favorite try guy video ever. I haven't laughed this hard in ages.
the young comment at 23:00
yeesh... this aged poorly. 4:43
“ straight people are crazy “ -Eugene
The bananas playing the sad music hit me unexpected
32:02 Victorian wedding dresses were like this and this big if not bigger
White is only for virgins😂 so you’d be wearing anything but white, you can still wear any other shade in the white spectrum
Eugene is good at everything
For some reason this made me think “wow, Keith would make a good drag queen” more than the drag video did
Here after Eugene announced he’s leaving and so glad I’m rediscovering the try guys. You guys bring me so much joy
I loved this video and then I designed for a fashion show...now I'm stressed
You know what? Keith’s dress looks exactly like an early Regency English court dress. He’s actually a historical fashion guru.
I love the way Keith says "Ding Dong"!
Keith predicted nymphia wind’s banana theme
Honestly Keith is right, just saying it’s in creative is not good critique.
Not me JUST noticing Eugene posing at the ending comments 😂
Love, love Eugene's wedding dress!😊
I loved being in my brother and sister-in-laws wedding! Never have I had a dress that I could or would ever want to wear more than once. All of the bridesmaids were in long black gowns that could be cut down and worn, long, mid length, and then just above the knees (have) fat knees. LOL  All the men were in tuxedos and tails with top hats and tails. 😊
I honestly think all of you did really great. But wow, Eugene, this dress is actually amazing. Love it.
I miss Eugene
"You can't take THIS away from me", *intense eye contact* I started coughing from laughing so hard
*Reminder that Lauren and Keith are friends* is killing me 🤣🤣🤣 knowing people would hate cause he called her the B word and went off on a rant
Ned's dress looks good with the green belt ,,, i'm a lord of the rings to fan ,,, but i do love the black one
Watching this now after the food stuff and being jumpscared by the red head really confused me for a sec before I checked the timing of this video. I wonder where he is now.
Typical that thw gay guy hates symbols of monogamy
I think the best thing about Eugene's dress is the different textures. I love that the skirt looks silky, all the top is embroidered
4:44 Well I guess now we know why he didn't say his wife...
Wedding bell:"that's f***ing rude b****"
I guessed they missed the editing on this one 😅😅😅
In every video Lauren is in she's too negative 😒 She doesn't seem like a team player
For the record my wedding dress is black not white lol
Eugene's dress was pretty good!
Keith, maybe you should start looking into acting cause youre very creative
laurdiy: "i feel like it swallows you, not in a good way" keith: "i like being gobbled up like a banana"
zach pulls that wig off so well
Keith looks like a potato! 😂😂😂😂
i love how throughout the judging eugene put on more and more makeup LMAO
I think i look lovely  in wedding dress  just simple vintage 80s gown  with long back train
The top of neds dress is literally the pretty in pink dress but white.
I love the blurring of zacs nipples 😂
The chaos in the outro took me out
It won’t be by accident 😂😭
29:14
I think Keith looks fabulous  His energy and the wig really sell it
I see very little comments on that impresive banana deep throat, just WTF
I want more Eugene making stuff content ❤
I loved Kieth's dress, it definitely counts as a wedding dress in a fairycore wedding in the woods. I think they were a little too harsh on him.
I would die to wear Eugene’s dress 🖤 I’m obsessed with it!!
Somebody get JONNY HERE
21:57 I’m sorry, what prompted could you wear that top too? 😂
Bring this series back
Eugene putting lipstick on between Zach and Ned's turns.
Ned's giving a bad name to all of the Lord of the Rings fans.......... 'cause most of us understood the lessons of faithfulness and loyalty towards the people you love in those books............... including, for instance, Arwen and Aragorn.............. a couple who one may say are.... "bonded forever".............
22:56 little did he know
Eugene's dress was amazing.
Ok, as a fellow major chronic pain sufferer, I truly appreciate Zach’s idea here! I also can’t wear heels, and for my wedding, I literally picked the most comfortable dress I could find. I barely even cared what it looked like.  But also, as an artist, I think he genuinely made a lovely dress. If it had been filled out with a bustier of some sort, it would have knocked it outta the park.  Also, Eugene. Stop it. Why are you so good at everything???? I want this dress immediately..:and I don’t even wear dresses!
omg Keith.  My face genuinely hurts from laughing so hard.
Can we take a moment to talk about how amazing Eugene is at drawing? Like omg I wish I was good at drawing😭
I love Keith
My mother literally made my wedding dress alone in a month. Sure, it was probably simpler than many wedding dresses, but it can be done. It's like how everyone insists weddings cost a fortune. They don't have to. It's all about your choices. We just did a small thing that cost less than a couple of hundred in total. That's not what everyone wants, and that's ok, but it is an option.
😅😅😂😂😂
Eugene ATE THIS UP
the black dress was very impressive
Why does so many people have a sword at home? 23:38
Can we please talk about how amazing Eugine looked in his dress....stunning!
Keith's was so creative omgggggg
Eugene and Keith!!  🥰😍😂😂
The Lorax
how did Eugene literally make a black version of the dress my sister has for HER wedding? (it's soon)
Eugene slays in whatever he wears.
33:28.... um....did keith just?.
keith being a bridezilla when he's told he's not bride enough was so funny.  also, i want to see keith and eugene marry each other in those dresses (not shipping them, just the vibes of the two outfits goes perfectly together)
Soo. I now know what dress I want for my wedding. Eugene’s 😌
As a fashion student, I find this hilarious because I know how hard it is to make a wedding dress or ball gown over a matter of months let alone this
"should be white"... actually not.. white wedding dresses are a particulary recent thing in history and in looking at all cultures, colorful wedding dresses are the vast majority
I want Eugene's dress tbh
This makes me want to design a dress and make it, and go try on wedding dresses just to feel pretty
Ok one thing I don't get is how u Americans always say that marriage is death to single life, or bachelorette or bachelor party is the last hurrah before getting married, so you guys don't consider that u are in a relationship before marriage with someone? If you are engaged no just the one I am dating and promised to marry or what?! like this is a mystery to me,  gives a bad taste in my mouth when people so casually say things like that...
I would have loved to see Maggie reaction to Zach dress I’m very disappointed
I swear if Eugene wasn't gay lol
This aged badly
Im crying i love keith so much he truly shines in this video god
Lauren and Keith is just as good as Rosanna and Keith😂
"Their young together and their bonded forever" 😬
Honestly I would wear Eugenes wedding dress to my own wedding It’s so pretty 🤩✨💞
Zach knows what he's doing in those grey sweats 👀😂
I would 100% wear Eugene’s dress any chance I got
Add a bit of a cinched in waist with just a ribbon around would give it that bell silhouette  🔔 ya know?
In my humble opinion Keith is the Funniest/Best try guy😂❤
Ngl, I don't always like when dresses have "Clean cut bottoms"
I come back to this video every time purely for Keith's rage fest 😂
...I loved Zacks skirt tbh
Keith demonstrated fisting on a dress 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVED when Eugene and the judge were posing and Zach came sidling in and poses. So PERFECT!
Keith’s dress is literally the fearless (taylor’s version) album 😭
Keith looks like a buternut squash!
I would actually love Eugene to be on rupaul, he'd kill it!
Keith looks like a loaf of bread
Keith handled that brutal judging so well! lol
Keith being the bridezilla is a moment 😂
Keith's would be the perfect pairing for a comedy rendition of If I Was a Bell from Guys and Dolls
I genuinely adore Zach
keiths bananas really made me laugh
Ooooooooof the way this AGED 😂😂😂
For someone who loves weddings, he really loves cheating on his wife
I've come back to this video way too many times, just because of Sad Bell Keith.
i soooo want eugene’s dress omg
zach looks likes hippie jesus in that wig 😂
For some reason I hope everyone is healing. I wish them the best on their careers.
“i like being gobbled.”
Keith is serving baked potato 😂
keith is peak stoner humor
This aged like the finest banana bouquet LOL
Mmmm, i don't see why the judges loved Eugenes dress so much... it's not good looking... it looks cheap and wants to be too many things at the same time...
who is the genius responsible for the bananimations
Currently watching this as I sew three skirts with no patterns and try to be finished by the end of the night 😂😭😭
I dont care what the judges say Keith won this video
Everything is so clear when you know 5:24 isn’t that how Alex preferred to dress?
I LOOOOVE Eugene's dress 😍
29:07
Eugene can say he hates weddings all he wants but I saw him in 4k tearing up during Zach's wedding. I do hope he gets married to Matt one day, even if it's just a simple ceremony for just the two of them.
I want them to re-do this challenge but with Johnny and Kwesi, because that would be HILARIOUS
Roman and Eugene giving face personifying an excellent gay wedding, and Zach comes in clutch to add the authenticity of a token straight person who can't not be the center of attention lol
29:11, 30:18, 32:27 Keith was, personally, my favorite part
Considering they had 6 hours and barely any training. I can understand why they looked like that. The should have atleast a model to help them have a frame of reference.
Eugene’s dress is so beautiful! I would definitely wear that at my wedding
I was so excited to see Eugene's when I saw this in my reccomended, cuz I'm emo/gothic and knew he would do something dark, but holy fuck I am impressed. I would genuinely wear that to my wedding, he did incredible for someone who doesn't sew, hell I sew and I wouldn't do that well
In South Korean culture, family and relatives of the deceased wear white to the funeral. Interesting how Eugene had a different take.
I wore a black and white wedding dress and I loved it ❤
eugene saying that he doesn't care abt the emotional stuff at weddings but getting so in his feels at keith and zach's weddings 😭😭😭
23:46 zach’s “loser” just fully made my night
It's so toxic to read the same comments about Ned's case, just let it die soon and comment funny things about the video.
19:07  Lauren: *bombastic side eye*
I don’t know why, but Zach looks great in that wig. Plus the beard! The beard plus the wig looks great on him 😂❤️
No one: Keith: ding dong
I miss without instructions
16:51   Yes. Yes we are.
Bed loves weddings so much that he wanted two.
My doorbell needs to be Keith going “ding dong” lmao 🤣
IM CRYING EUGENE IS SO BEAUTIFUL  I WANNA LOOK GOOD IN A DRESS LIKE THAT 💔
keith just casually deepthroating a banana...
I lost it when Keith went ‘ding-dong’ 7:40 😭😭😭
What a fun video! Keith's just amazing for bringing all the laughs and goofs to the table, ding dong!
Dresses make me so dysphoric as a trans guy, but the only dress I'd ever wear would be eugenes
Eugene: "I really don't give a shit about weddings... It makes me wanna vomit." Also Eugene: weeps constantly throughout Zach and Maggie's wedding
Treating wedding like a funeral... Eugene was so accurate about this "event"
i would honestly wear eugene’s dress for my wedding
this aged poorly.
Eugene is honestly too talented at everything
Keith should have just tied a ribbon around the waist or upper top area to cinch it a bit :D but it made me laugh
17:03 you sure did struggle with being faithful to your wife
Zack in that wig is like looking at Andrew W.K.’s Younger, more adorable brother, i physically can’t take how much i love that hair on him!
35:50 okay but lets talk about how billie actually wore a dress similar to keith's at the oscars after party
I literally don't think I watches the first time around but I'm watching it now just because of the drama and how ironic and horrible it is now
Eugene is just ICONIC
*aspiring wedding gown wearer here to be excited* haha
23:00 bombastic side eye
Zach's "Won't be by accident! 👹👺" had me *cackling.* 😂😂
he loved weddings so much, he left for a 2nd one
I just wanted to see how poorly this aged so fast 😆☠😆😭😭😭😭
ayo jump scare :0
Eugene encouraging Keith is the bessssst🥺💖💖💖💖  adorable!!!
WHY DOES NO ONE TALK ABOUT KEITHS LENGTH ON THAT BANANA
It's evil step mom getting married again, the two daughter and the annoying blonde cinderella ruining the party
I feel like I would have loved Eugene's dress more if he kept that patterned lace off of the bodice. The dramatic plunge neck would have looked amazing on him.
Still surprised that knowing how to use a sewing machiene means something in the US, like it's not a basic life skill everyone is taught at school, most people don't have a sewing machiene or sewing needles and tons of different coloured thread and sometimes fabric at home somewhere. So absurd. I'm so sorry for y'all's education like every day :')
Keith’s dress reminds me of Mama Kass of the 1960s.
I think this may be the most obvious Eugene win I’ve ever seen holy shit he slayed
I would absolutely wear Eugene's dress if it was fitted to me. It's beautiful
Wedding gowns do not have to be white.  They can be any colour the bride feels comfortable in. White gowns were started by Queen Victoria..it was never a tradition before her.
Matthew was a super fun judge, wouldn't mind seeing him in more vids 😂🙂
Why is eugene so good at everything 😭😂
Keith is so funny, that dress is hilarious
Eugene killed this one!    I LOVED that dress for him!  Beautiful
I hope Eugene kept that dress and uses it for drag now it slays
Ned's "Elves are young forever and are bonded forever...Everything a wedding should hope to be."  What a slimy traitor.
Not gonna lie Keith somewhat predicted the glorious Lizzo's Grammy dress tho
I would totally let Eugene design a dress for me! Maybe in a lighter color, but still.
That lace insert and cowl back on Eugene’s dress is everything!!!
KEITH WAS ROBBED!!!
Petition for Eugene to design the costumes for the next season of Wednesday where she and enid get married
for some reason i can never remember zach’s name but he’s such a special soul and low key my favorite next to eugene😭
4:47 👀 😬
Eugene’s dress is giving: “My last husband died under mysterious circumstances” and I love it.
Eugene showing us excellence ONCE AGAIN!!! The king goes undefeated!!!!
Look I'm not saying it was *good* per se but Keith's dress is definitely in the ballpark of Viktor and Rolf's tulle Haute Couture collections
29:03
Im sorry but my first thought was what a waste of fabric 😅
All Keith needed to do was to add a big cinched belt/obi as a high waist and that dress would be fabulous!
, when your life's a mess When you're feeling blue, always in distress I know what can wash that sad away All you have to do is... Put a banana in your ear!
keith was severely underrated in this episode. Bell is beautiful SAY IT WIYH ME BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL BELL IS BEAUTIFUL
WHO put together the montage for Keith's tradition explanation? "The groom crawls" at 14:50 did not have to be THAT but I'm so thankful it was💀💀💀
Eugene's dress gave me chills 😳
I love Ned's wedding dress 😭
Eugene fucking ATE
Eugene is a Black Veil Bride 😂😂😂
This is all just practice for when Eugene is on drag race✨😁💃
No one is talking about how good Eugenes sketch is
keith is just sooo camp
Watching these videos make me realize that Keith can never have an even half normal idea. He always has the most abstract, chaotic ideas, and I love it
Coming back to this video just for the comments 😂😂
I would actually wear Eugene's dress at me wedding. The ONLY difference I'd do is have the back part more tightly fitted, and maybe have more poof on the bottom.
Zach saying “loser” in his dress got me ded 😂😂
"Say yes to distress" 😂
keith catching the banana took me the fuck out
“Straight people are weird” literally bc a garter toss is so weird
Does anyone else just want Keith to win everytime but then he comes out in a bell and Eugene comes out looking like a snack and your like fuck Keith 😂
Zach's dress was genuinely so good. I can definitely see it in a high fashion show
I love Eugene's dress... but Ned's was my favourite just coz of the ears...🤣🤣🤣
Straight people are crazy 🤣🤣🤣... no no... that's a white tradition
EUGENE AAAAAAAAAATE
Hopefully Zach's marriage will go a lot better than Ned's
no one is talking enough about how GOOD zach looks in his wig
It was weird seeing flashes of the castle I've been to a dozen times and know very well and think "there's a castle like that in the states?"
Oh those banana 🍌 graphics! 🤣🤣🤣
Keith perfectly catching each banana thrown his way is hilarious
Micarah Tewers: weaklings
Eugene saying hand sewing is his least favorite part is the opposite of me hand sewing most of my projects because the sewing machine runs away from me. And "much to Rachel's delight and my dismay" argh, yeah, _sleevils_ same
Next you should TRY: Wedding cakes
POV you’re watching this AFTER the fact 😅
I want to wear Eugene’s dress at my wedding 26:38
I cant wait for Without Instructions this 2023! Hopefully they will include the other Try guests as contestants ❤❤
Eugene’s dress, if my partner showed up in that dress to our wedding, I would think it was the most beautiful thing. Let’s be honest Eugene did so good.
Keith: thats fucking rude bitch 29:15  Everyone: hysterical laughter erupts Me: screaming on the floor
Omg weddings and his  wife… awkward
You think Keith had it in the first half until judging 😂
ok but like billie would pull off a lime green version of keith’s dress so well 35:49
29:15
Eugenes was my favorite, and I’m mad at how much I liked Neds. Especially now
Eugene's dress is giving me Wednesday vibes from the Netflix TV series 🙌 like that's something Wednesday would definitely wear for her wedding.
Zach at 23:45 going “loserrr” is wayyyyy too hilarious 😂😂😂
I would legitimately wear Eugene’s dress to my own wedding, no joke. It’s so freaking gorgeous
I love that the Professionals are rolling with the insanity, giving genuine feedback, and obviously having so much fun with it all 😆
4:49 dam and alex
I love 2 things; Weddings and Lord of the rings (true)
Not sure how many of you viewers have purchased fabric, but the amount of money that must have gone into all that fabric in keith's dress is... phenomenal.
Keith’s aggressive comments towards Lauren are so much funnier now that Lauren is engaged 😭😭
I WANT EUGENE TO DESIGN MY WEDDING DRESS NOW🤩
22:58 this aged like fine wine😭
Kinda knew Eugene would win this one lol
I don't like her.
Zach my grandson had a pajama wedding.
Keith standing next to all of the guys in his belle dress made me cry hysterically. He looks like neds huge hunchback grandma trying to be cutesy
5:40 — Thank you Eugene, thank you.
Eugene....how is it the death of your single life if you've probably been with the person you're gonna marry, for at least a few years?....meaning, they haven't been single in a good while 😂
Mmm...this aged like crap
Eugene absolutely slayed. What a majestic bird.
Laurdiy is annoying asl pls dont bring her back
I loved the Judges
Didn’t have to watch the entire episode to know that Eugene would win this one 😂
Eugene left NO crumbs 😂✨
I love Keith so much. He’s hilarious 😂
I am SO glad I came to this comment section now
Eugenes dress is so gorgeous, I just wanna look at it forever
Keith is super entertaining 🤣🤣🤣
Keith, in his dress, looks like that mouse from that Thumbelina movie who was like "marry the mole!" No? Just me? ... o0kay
"ive never struggled with anything so much in my whole life" - what about fidelity!!
Ned's comment about "weddings and lord of the rings" did not age well...
Eugene NEEDS to go into dress making
Eugene's sketch??? so good like what
Oomph when he said Lord of the rings instead of his wife 😬😬😬😬😬😬
Eugene SLAYED
Keith's is the bodice and the skirt in 1 Innovative
Hate the woman
"You've never been to a funny wedding. *sassy banana eating*  Maybe that says something about your friends." 😂
Does anyone know when Zach is getting married?
“Elves are young forever and they’re bonded forever. The two things I hope a wedding should be”   Riiiiiight Ned
Eugene: “weddings are basically funerals for your single life”  well, not for Ned
oh ned, the irony
I think Keith looks like a giant baked potato :). The lighter line down the middle is even how the potato is split ready for toppings!
Did that lady judge mention who she was btw? She was just such a bitch it's insane.
So… was the cheating going on during this time?? Because the irony is unbelievable
I think if anyone but Ned got fired from the try guys, the try guys wouldn’t be the try guys anymore. Ned was always just there but everyone else has such a strong personality that makes everything so entertaining to watch.
I love how Ned said “I love weddings and lord of the rings” at least he was honest by not putting his wife on the list of things he loves
If you read comments before watching the entire video, make sure you don't eat or drink anything during Keith's presentation. You''ll thank me later.
I’m not sure if they would be ok with all the comments about ned, sure he did a bad, bad bad thing. But we do not know details? At least not official ones that have been thoroughly disclosed. If your gonna take it out on anybody, take it out on him… they were friends at one point, wouldn’t you feel a little bit sensitive after after what they’ve been through? I’m not meaning to go on a tangent, but I don’t feel that they should have to deal with this and suffer consequences of HIS actions? How many of you would actually feel if your friend did this? Would you drop them? I know many would not. This is what makes them good people, they should be told regularly that they did the right thing for themselves and their company. I get that a lot of people are mad, but maybe take it to Reddit?  Also Keith’s fricking dress, if he had done like, a ruched (or even a gathered top pieces), layered top with a halter neck line like neds, a bell bottom, aman did it with a combo of different yellows/pale yellow/white overlays dark som length at the bottom? Now that, that could work? AND IT WOULD BE SHAPED LIKE A BELL.
CAN WE JUST TALK ABT HOW GOOD EUGENE IS AT DRAWING?
24:26 among us irl????
Fun fact the reason they stop making the dresses so wide and poofy is because so many women would end up catching on fire from the candles and would burn to death
I am absolutely lost on the banana bit, but I lvoe the rest of the video! Made me laugh and smile
Alright guys my wedding dress is black. But not I was Eugene to design a second black one for me PLEASE.
The way Keith deep-throated that banana 😳
Keith's judging had me howling laughing. "That's fucking rude bitch!" 😭😂
"Ned loves weddings" not his own apparently
"Ned loves weddings" not his own apparently
when Zach said that the two things Ned loved were weddings and his wife, and then Ned changed it to weddings and Lord of the rings at 4:44 I just went straight to the comments lol
When this video first came out I sensed something was off cause Ned didn’t mention his wife once in a wedding dress video. Now we know.
Zach looking like the flower girl standing next to Eugene & Roman
Ok the way I would ABSOLUTELY commission a dress like Eugene's for my wedding 🤩
Ned loves weddings so much he wanted the opportunity to have another one
I actually NEED Eugene's dress to be my actual wedding dress
33:30 😳
Why is this video still up? I thought they were reading all traces of Ned. Just curious. Although I'm so happy that Eugene won. His dress was everything!!!
17:03 Ned struggled harder being a faithful husband apparently
This episode didn’t age well 😂
i love that wedding dress designer lol
LaurDiy as a judge is not my fav. She tries too hard to be a hater.
does Eugean just win every challenge? I have been binging on this series, and it seems that Eugean is just good at everything
Eugenes' looks like a proof of concept for a real dress 😲
My friend had a black wedding dress for her wedding! So Eugene was on point!
I love Matthew as a guest, I hope he comes back, he's clearly having a blast!
Things that Ned’s done that look good: Puppet Dress Chicken Noodle plush Legs for days figurine  Alex Ice cream cake Pizza clock
Ned loves weddings so much he wanted another one 💀
Ur right eugene straight people are crazy
Bro these comments
i’m losing it all these ned comments
This did not age well, Ned.
I would absolutely wear Eugene’s dress in a heartbeat!
Oh look Ned made Alexandra her wedding dress
Eugene's sketch tho 😍
Eugene is annoyingly talented
I want Eugenes dress
Keith's dress reveal! I'm rolling, I can't breath! XDD Send HALP!  "I would like a compliment." Killed me. I'm dead. Send a necromance to resurrect me.
Honestly, I hate lace. I think it's absolutely ugly on anything, wedding dress or not. But I also don't find a traditional wedding appearling in anyway. We didn't have one. we went to the courthouse and signed a paper. i wore a blue dress that went to my kness, it was a bridesmaid dress originally for 30 dollars. So there's that.
Not trying to be funny I really want the gothic dress sketch please! Thanks.
Ned loves weddings so much that now he gets two, if he can even pull another girl.
Try guys won't be the same without Ned. They're going go their separate ways, sooner rather than later, I would think.
This video has one of my favorite Eugene quotes just ever, "Straight people are crazy" said in the most honest tone lmao, it gets me every time
Yay! (Spoilers) . . . . .  I'm so glad Eugene won lol
Strange he said lord of the rings instead of 'My Wife' he makes me 🤢
27:57 honestly Zachary, comedy goals hahaha I am in tears that look next to them wow Jersey shores new hot girl is entering the villa 🔥
This video aged like an old bowl of cereal with only the milk left, but then you left out for 20 days and a bunch of fruit flies fly around it.   Yeah… that’s Ned for you.
Ned stopped loving his wife here 🤣
Neds preparing for his next marriage which will be poly. Featuring Ned, someone else's fiance and the fucking audacity.
Can we find an excuse to have Matthew back as a judge? He was so sweet and funny
It feels strange seeing ned in the video
I have replayed Keith catching those bananas (and missing the one while he wasn't wearing his glasses) WAY too many times... :,D
Omw I love the black dress!!!!!!
The banana band animation--- I can't breathe from laughing!
I've never laughed so hard watching a video before 🤣
Ding Dong
Yo Zack is so funny wtf! 😂 it’s the small comments that get me
DING DONG
29:32 I know keith is just acting, but it scares me everytime because I don't know how the others will react 😭
I love Ned’s for two reasons, one LOTR obviously and the fact I would actually considering wearing a more constructed version of that dress for my wedding.
I like Keith's bell dress
I love how all of the top comments are the new ones after Ned's cheating and they're all so good
Keith looks like the big cake mama in nutcracker 😂
“Love two things, weddings and *lord of the rings* “  atleast he didnt mention his angel of a (hopefully soon to be ex) wife
6 hours is so little time to make any dress let alone a wedding dress
Keith my wedding dress was gold so I think it's just fine
32:09 a banana with saladfinger-hands is playing a piano
This video did not age well 😅
Keith legit had me in tears. He's so fucking funny... and a bell
As someone who hates dresses. I would wear Keith’s bell… but mostly because it’s more bell than dress and I can wear anything I want underneath
Keith in this dress  is "I'm happy joyful guy" personified. 💙🔔🥰💯
No because Eugene would have definitely won if Safiya Nygard was one of the judges.
[zach abt the flower n1pples] "they come right off, just like real n1pples," EXCUSE ME 😭😭😭
I hated it when Eugene hurt himself
I'd love to go to a wedding where the bride looked like Keith, it certainly would be a moment to remember.
Ned: "I never struggled with anything so hard in my life"  Now you can struggle with your future divorce
Ned loves Alex, cheating and ruining marriages
"Elves are young forever and bonded forever. Two things weddings hope to be." Not your wedding, Ned.
No he announced third place to zach without any hesitation 😭😂
Skipping over Ned because he pisses me off
I've said it on without  a recipe I'll say it here. I want to see the professionals take their ideas and perfect it. The guys usually  have decent ideas. I'd love to see the designers execute them
Why is Eugene  so good at everything?
Watching this for the first time after Nedgate. Sigh
Wedding bell or wedding pumpkin? Love you keith!
I wonder if he ruins relationship just for more weddings? /j
I genuinely want Eugene’s dress ❤❤❤
Kieth looks horrendous😂 hahaha I laughed so hard I love it
Pro tip - just skip past Fulmer's bs; the other three are great in this.
Ding DONG
I love that the designer is having sooo much fun and not being super serious
The bananaband killed me
29:51 Keith reminds me of the sludge spirit in spirited away
I've never been so sad to rewatch something... I remember thinking it was weird that Ned didn't talk about his wife during the WEDDING episode... now I just wonder, did this whole secret relationship affect videos like this one?
Everyone commenting about the Ned situation is making it worse on everyone involved. Let them enjoy this page as a safe space to create content and  deal with their situation in private.
kieth looks like a drum stick
Did I pretend this was Eugene on Ru Paul’s drag race? Absolutely
Keith looks like a cheese ball 😭
I want a Eugene dress just to wear for day to day bro
Did Keith just... give a subtle shout out to Trixie and Katya at the end...? While in drag??
Z: im ned, I love two things, weddings and my wife  Cheater: lol I love one but not the latter
Zach: *imitating Ned* "I love two things, weddings and my wiiiiife" Ned: "I love two things, weddings and LORD OF THE RINGS"  Very very telling.
I honestly LOVE Eugene. He has such a cold attitude but something about it feels so warm. Like he'd protect you with everything, but would never actually say it.
SOMETHING WITH MAKEUP
You know what’s a huge clue from this episode. Ned “the wife guy” NOT recreating Ariel’s wedding dress. Like cmon now, this episode was the perfect for that and would be completely in character for him to do. He could have had conversations about his wife and their wedding, yet there was none of that. Very telling, given everything we know now.
okay but they are getting better at these fr
I’m obsessed with Eugene’s dress
Eugene had no excuse to wear a suite to the met gala. Just sayin…
I actually loved the shape of Zack's and I was not expecting it to have any shape lol would have put him second.   Ned's looks like any $20 wish wedding dress, so would have put him at the bottom for zero creativity in the execution (the idea was good but his dress didn't match the idea)  Eugene is Eugene's and definitely deserved the 1st  Would have put Keith's third for the creativity and almost couture nature of it (but def would have been better if the bottom was even lol). I can't even imagine how great it would have been if they had found him a 10 ft circle skirt to sew onto the bottom of the regular circle skirt
I lost it when the sad banana playing a violin appeared! 🤣
" I've never struggled with anything so hard in my life."  Are you sure about that?
Ned is so much more annoying... Too bad you can't edit him out of this video.  I love Eugene's dress idea. For only having six hours, I'm surprised the others got anything reasonably made.
😂😂😂Keith is hilarious, everyone is but Keith is on a different level here😂
4:38-5:08 is really tough. Skip it if you don't wanna see Ned wife stuff
Kinda wish they'd edit Ned out of old vids so I didnt get instantly angry everytime I saw his face lmao
Ned, u love ur wife soooooo much. I hope nothing happens that could ya know break that nice relationship!
4:49 Ned saying that his wife ain’t in his top to things
16:55 hmm... that is a choice of words.
This is just making me want a sewing competition show a la great british bake off or forged in fire with people who are actual ameteur/hobbyist seamsfolk
Bruh noooo this is so stressful to watch as someone that make clothes for fun
Keith’s bell is cuter than most “avant-garde” “fashion” that walks the runway.
Okay, Keith actually did an awesome job, I love it. It's giving VOGUE.
Elves ... they're bonded forever. OOOOOF, that did NOT age well. first time watching this and I've critiqued ned so much already lmfao
the way i literally screamed at eugene's omg the lillies too
“Do you think it’s a wedding dress?” “…no sweetie” 😂😂😂😂
This video does not age well 😬
Am I the only one who liked Zach's dress? Like if I were having a hippie outdoor wedding I would totally wear something like that
Eugene looked so hot
Kind of was hoping Eugene would be like “It’s Morticia Addams’ wedding dress” but simply putting making the wedding fun(eral) is good too.
I'm so sorry but for some strange reason, when I saw Keith's dress it reminded me of cousin It from the Addam's family.
Eugene's bouquet should have been black roses to match the aesthetic.
hhhmmm something about ned just isnt sitting right here....
17:00 Ned: this is so hard, I've never struggled with something so hard before          How about staying faithful? Clearly that was harder for you
I was so excited to see Eugenes dress and he did not disappoint 🤩
This is probably the most poorly aged Try Guys video on their channel
Did Lauren get on anyone else’s nerves in this video?
NOW THIS AGED POORLY! LOLi see why ned loves weddings, now when ariel divorces his sorry ass he can attend her wedding to yung gravey
Eugene is just always posing in his wedding dress and I love it so much
did Eugene mention the velcro of Cape to the judges ?!
I found the wigs extremely natural on them
I'm really in love with the sparkly yellow orange fabric that Keith picked
I always find the judges too hard on Keith. I found his dress extremely creative 😂 like who could pf thought of such dress
Sometimes, I still hear Keith saying DING DONG in my sleep..
bloody hell the longer i look at keith's wedding dress the prettier it gets 😂
28:40-28:43 Keith looked so happy and proud that it made me wanna cry that they were laughing so hard even though I know he loves doing these things to be funny 😂😂 but he looked sooo happy !!! Loved your design Keith. Ding dong
Okay but Keith in that wig looks so natural
Not me crying laughing at Keith confused how he has so many uncut fabric because that's how I literally am most of the time 😭
i love keith
Keith acted a WHOLE fool in the judging 😂😂
too bad ned loves weddings more than being married
Where can buy Eugene's weeding dress? It looks so beautiful.
Well he did say he loves 'weddings', not 'being married after the wedding'...
Ive always said, the people who mention things unprompted and defensively, they usually are trying to convince others as well as themselves that it is believable. The amount of times Ned mentioned his wife for no reason made me uncomfortable because why are you trying to convince everyone around you??? they already know?????
I would be happy to wear Eugene’s gown.
I love that the designer name dropped a bunch of people I’ve never heard of. 😅
Ned loves weddings so much he destroyed two of them
Y’all really missed out on calling Eugene a 👰‍♂️🖤 BLACK VEIL BRIDE 🖤👰‍♂️
Someone smart, please bless us with GIFs of "would a banana make you feel better?" And "quick! Revive her with a banana". I need GIFs of all Bell-Keith x Banana content
Me and Eugene are the same, all vision, confused execution(in my case, no regard for the execution)
4:45 oh god
Keith would be a bridezilla
Ned saying he has never struggled with anything so hard… clearly he struggled not cheating on his wife 🤷‍♀️  Lauren telling Ned he shines’s bright but not the brightest really shows.   Aside from jokes, could we talk about how stunning Eugene looks in that revenge dress, and how gorgeous Zack looks like a girl?! 😭💓
You're gonna look me in my eyes and tell me that keith got 4?! Also bullshit about being hard to choose, eugene's dress fucks and I'm very glad she won
"I love two things: weddings and Lord of the Rings." We should have seen it coming. 💀
16:52 "are we worried about Ned?"  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHA, 🤣😭🤬
Keith is my entire sense of humor
Yaaaaaaaas Eugeeneee killingggg ittt!!!!!
I love Keith's bridezella moments 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
This aged horribly for Ned
i know how to sew and this is honestly legitimately difficult. draping a pattern on a dress form that isn’t your measurements is pretty high level.
"Ned loves two things- weddings and his wife." ....well that didn't age well
Keith's dress is for Teletubbies or dobby
Me planning to make my own wedding garment in less than a year from sketch to final thing, and I'm just at the first mock up stage. But I have no idea what kind of bodice I want, so I'm going to take some old sheets and see what I like. I can make a pair of parachute pants in a day, but a whole dress, that's a lot.
“Elves are young forever and bonded forever, the two things weddings hope it should be” well clearly you weren’t that invested in being bonded forever, now were you ?
I honestly would wear Eugene’s dress to my wedding. I love that design, that back is just perfect.  It would have been so cool if the winner had their dress actually created !
Keith "smoking" a banana right about talking about how he want to be gobbled up like a banana and then STILL being surprised everyone was unsettled just shows how fun he is
I'm so impressed with Eugene's dress, I'd actually wear it to a Halloween party or if any one of my friends want a gothic wedding
4:48 Weddings and LOTR... but not his wife. Hmmm 🤔
Definitely want a black wedding dress
Neds is a Halloween costume sry
Ned…
22:58 that aged horribly... maybe he meant the second wedding
I would wear Eugene’s dress. I love it.
I do wish someone had called Eugene out for that awful little baby veil. It just ruined the effect, he’d have been better off draping more of the lace from the train over his head.
Whoever edited the bananas in this, is a genius!
I feel like Mrs. Featherington (from Bridgerton) would force Penelope to use Keith's dress to her own wedding
keith was ROBBED he shldve been third place!!!
sus
*ugh i cannot even enjoy this video without cringing at every ned scene…. fuck damn it ned, u literally ruined EVERYTHING ugh*
23:00 “The two things every wedding hopes it should be” yikes 🥴
Lmao ned in this
Keith saying Ding Dong was everything for this video.
Not cheating 17:00
Wasn't there another wedding try on video that I can't find
My great grandmother's sister actually had a black wedding dress. Her mother died suddenly just before the wedding and the mourning period hadn't ended by the time the wedding was scheduled (they were poor farmers, so rescheduling the wedding when the food was already bought was not an option for them)
I never wanted a black wedding dress when I was planning my wedding, but I love Eugene's dress so much I want to have another wedding (to the same man!) just so I can wear that showstopper! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💐
Ned loves weddings so much that he fucked his marriage up so he could have another one.
Not really love his wife apparentlyyyyyyy
Okay but lowkey, actually no, high key, I am obsessed with keiths dress like, it feels so fashion forward with the silhouette
Not Ned saying he loves weddings but not his wife. Then there is the fan base “we KNOW you don’t love your wife”
0:54 shoutout for Haarzuilens castle, where my Dutchies at 😁
So we have Ariel, Alexandria and the wedding dress stand  4:40
Zach's dress is honestly iconic, I love it the more I see it
4:46-4:52 did not age well 💀
NONONO ITS ZACK IN FOURTH PLACE
I’ve been watching these guys for years but honestly personally attacking Ned won’t do anything to change this painful situation for Ariel and her family. I think what we should do to support the guys and ariel is to let this drama come to close.
if Eugene's dress was in red though ..
I love this so much
Keith had me cry laughing this entire episode. So funny. DING. DONG.
22:57 "elves are young forever and bonded forever. two things every wedding hopes it should be"   well that aged like milk
I really feel defensive about them roasting my man Keith.
Knowing now about Ned, first time he didn't talk about his wife in this context, but Lotr. Eugene looked great. Impressive in such a short time.
Bruh Ned saying two things he love in the world is ‘weddings and lord of the rings’ now instead of what he USED to say was ‘weddings and my wife’ is the biggest sign and red flag ever 💀
I adore Keith
tbh I would've put zach last and keith 3rd cuz at least keith did what he meant to do 💀 and zach's is just um.. not wearable and overall horrendous
Keith is so funny. Also, fuck Ned for almost bringing this entire thing down.
anyone know where zachs shirt is from???
keith actually made me wet myself, those bananas just ruined me
I would definitely wear Eugene's dress
Eugene is the moment.
“i’ve never struggled with anything so hard in my life” except maintaining your focus
Keith, you had me rolling with laughter. Omg, this episode was hilarious.
No matter how many times I watch this, I love Eugene's catch in the end, darkness reigns
Ned deserves to be kicked out of their company for what he's done but ngl I will miss him and his dynamic with the other guys :/
JA! He didnt say "my wife"  yup Ned you be slippin
When Keiths design and then actual produce this shown it is literally funny
Just for hilarity factor, Keith won. But, honestly, Eugene's dress is 1000% my favorite dress. Scandal or not when it comes to Ned, that black dress is EVERYTHING.
“Ned loves weedings, and his wife” WELL SHIT
I absolutely love 😍 Eugene's dress but oh my gosh Keith 🤣🤣🤣  Man i love Keith
Ned: "This is so hard.  I've never struggled with anything so hard in my life"  *raised brow*
Eugene looks amazing and Keith looks adorable as always
ned really said "bonded forever" and "what everyone hopes a wedding will be" in the same sentence 💀
@4:45 We should have seen it coming 😂😂
as a response to zack saying "i love two things, weddings and my wife",  ned says "I love two things,  weddings and lord of the rings."  HM.  4:45
This did not age well
really hope ariel leaves his ass i hate cheaters so much
4:45 this hits different after that new episode
The somber bananas playing instruments 🤣
Omg Eugene’s drawing is so pretty!
wanting to watch this episode for the guys’ dresses, visibly cringing and wanting to throw up seeing ned do anything
Sometimes I forget Eugene is from Texas, and then he says conniption and it all comes back XD
“Elves are young forever, and they’re bonded forever; the two things every wedding hopes it should be” Except for yours I suppose…
I really hope Eugene is in therapy 5:36
Keith is giving me nightmares 😂 DING DONG
Keith sounding like the mom from Bobs Burger everytime he says “Ding Dong!”
Anyone else felt Eugene’s pain? Needle gun
Zac: "I'm Ned Fulmer and I love 2 things. Weddings, and my wife." Ned: "I love 2 things. Weddings, and Lord of the Rings" Me: "That didn't age well."
ned likes weddings so much that he ruined his marriage to have another one!
Straight people are crazy
Bro right after Eugene said “it’s the death of your single life.” I got a therapist ad
okay but why is no one talking about how they pixelated zach’s nipples but not ned’s 😂😭
Keith’s dress made me audibly go what the fuck 😭😭 he looks like a baguette
Eugene is such a good artist oh my god
I watch these to see what Keith comes up with because I know that it is most likely bad lmao
i just think it’s hilarious how eugene managed to act as if he wasn’t going to win a dress making challenge
Ned's dress deserved the win, I think people have some bias with Eugene and it ruins this things for me 😒  But Keith 🤣🤣🤣 always the most creative. How can they say that's not creative, can't with this people.
Honestly Ned saying that sewing this dress is so hard and that he’s never struggled with anything so hard before in his life is like a slap in the face when it’s now out that he’s been cheating on his wife and the mother of his two children for months at this point.
How dare this cheater taint Lord of the Rings weddings for me.
Okay but I can totally see a celebrity wearing a wedding dress like Keith’s
did not age well
Zach: "My name's Ned, I love weddings and my wife."  Ned: "I love weddings and Lord of the Rings"   ......... that didn't age well.
the only thing ned loves more than weddings is destroying them :-)
Well didn’t this one age well, right Ned?
The fact that Ned said two things and changed his wife to lotr 💀
"Are we worried about Ned?" you ~SHOULD~ be 😭😭😭
“are you just stacking tule?” “uh-huh” “on a hoop skirt?“ “uh-huh”😂😂
Feels icky watching videos w Ned in them now.   That said, I'm glad my faves were always Keith & Eugene. And tbh, I feel like now it's shifting to Zach & Eugene 😅😊  Also, I love Zach's wig. He's rocking the long curly/wavy hair 😁
I love Zach’s blurred-out nipnops.
My favourite thing about this series is the professional explaining exactly what to do and then it shows the guys doing the complete opposite
Let's take a moment to appreciate Eugene's gorgeous sketch.
Did anyone else notice he didn’t mention Ariel or “my wife” once in this vid ?
This Video aged really poorly...
Eugene is just too funny this is why he's my favorite, and he doesn't like consensual workplace relationships, Ned. 😒
Kieth judging for his wedding dress is my new comfort video
Genuinely hard to watch anything with Ned in it now
4:44 That was uh...well.. that's how you lose trust in wife guys
ned threw it all away and for what?
Keith is the star of this show.
Keith looks like a giant yam and I am dying
This whole thing feels bitter now looking back.
I always relate to Eugene even when I'm trying not to. He's freaking awesome. Ned's fake a$$ had always been off putting tbh and blander than a grain of unflavored rice.
"ned loves two things: weddings and his wife" "im ned and i love two things: weddings and lord of the rings" 😬😬😬 this was foreshadowing
4:45 this moment did not age well and it fucking sucks
Aww I didn't know that Zach's getting married. A big Congratulations to him!
Me listening and watching ned body language like a hawk...
God I can't even watch this with Ned in it, screw him.
I guess Ned loved his wedding but not his wife huh what a notion. 😒
eugenes was so good! i would honestly wear it lol
Lauren annoys me and idk why
This didn’t age well 😂 “Ned loves two things his wife and weddings”
everything keith does is so fascinating yet it hurts my soul with all the fabric he uses
I love two things weddings and cheating on my wife
Sewing is super hard and doing all of this in 6hs?? Honestly i am so proud of the results!!
I feel like you would see Keith’s dress on one of those weird high fashion runways
this one aged like milk.
Zack looks really good in that wig
"I've never struggled with anything so hard in my life "
@4:44 he responds with how he loves two things. One of them is NOT his wife, it’s Lord Of The Rings.
I am HERE for the ned slander yall
It feels weird to see Ned now
I loved Eugene's dress. But sorry they do owe Keith an apology.  I have seen dresses like his or worse in fashion magazines and on catwalks in France.  For example  check out Viktor & Rolf’s Spring 2019 Couture collection. Or even check out some of Molly Goddard autumn/winter 2017.
I genuinely think Ned is high in this video and the bridesmaids one too. 😳
How is Ned not gay
Agree. Eugene deserved first.
What can Eugene not do?! 😭😭😭
I can't be suprised about Eugene saying  wedding is the death of single lives. Also the fact that he wanted to do a black dress
4:45  Zach: “My name is Ned Fulmer and I love two things, weddings and my wife  Ned: “I love two things, weddings and lord of the rings”😢  This is so sad considering he used to find any opportunity to bring up Ariel
i love 2 things : wedding and Lord of the Rings.  not his wife 😳😳😳😳😠😠😠😠😠
I know this video aged poorly, but...Keith and his bell are still too good.
You think Ned can re-use this dress at his second wedding?
Is this one of those videos Becky watches, shakes her head, laughs until she can't breathe and says, "He's mine." 🤣🍌🍌
Ned “this is so hard, I’ve never struggled with anything so hard in my life” lol just wait bro. You’re gonna be unemployed, cancelled & viral on tiktok lmao
Can we take a moment to appreciate zach's hair growth. It looks really good.
I love how Eugene talks about not knowing how to sew but he’s probably the best out of the guys
i keep coming back and watching this video bc i cant get over keith spinning and just lightly saying “ding dong”
Ned did such a good job I would unironically wear that, if it were like a little more finished 😂
Oh but Lauren from the beginning being like it has to be white and then changing her mind for Eugene but you know if anyone else made any other color of dress including black she would have been mad and not given them a pass 😭
Love keith
“Straight people are crazy”
I came here again only for tashy comments towards ned lol
ned is kinda sus in this episode
the elf worked way better than it should of, good design, kinda poor construction, but thats fine, they're amateurs. and if it wasnt for eugene, it would look really good. but of course eugene killed it
The fact that Zach said he loved wedding and his wife…and he corrected him to say weddings and lotr lmfao
Me rewatching this and hearing ned say: I never struggled with anything so hard in my life. Like dude ur pulling a double life
The power puff girl shirt 😅 it’s cute though
The power puff girl shirt 😅 it’s cute though
STOP... why even bother showing this video to me after NED's cheating incident? UGH so nasty! Do not even. I'm so disgusted. Ned - If you see this, I hope you know you are the lowest of lows. That probably means nothing to you because you're only after Ariel for the publicity because she's so much more elegant than you, but still. Go run into the hole that you deserve. Goodbye!
I just heard about how Ned cheated on his wife omg
The wedding series is suddenly a lot more interesting
why does Keith lowkey look like Lana Del Rey in that wig
Ned loves weddings so much he wanted two of em
Eugene being the “experienced but no experience” guy? I’m here for it
Eugene could have a literally made his own dress for the met gala, he’s so talented
4:45  ned... it's true how he changed it from ariel to lotr 🕳️🧑‍🦯
22:56 aged like milk
Keith is ALWAYS a winner in my heart 💛 he was a FABULOUS Bell and a BEAUTIFUL bride 🔔
Keith's bride impression was PERFECTION 😂
Interesting how he didn't say he loved his wife this episode with everything going on, kinda sus here
The banana anime is soooo funny
Eugene is soooo beautiful
I watched this before the news of Ned hit, broooo this really didn’t age well and it’s been like a couple of days
Them being sweet to Keith about his dress and how it is a bell has me in tears. 😂
I've tried rewatching some try guy videos but it just feels wrong after what happens with Ned and Alex
That whole "Ned loves 2 things weddings and his wife" really didn't age well😬
Can someone please help Ned make a divorce dress?
22:56 This didn't age well.
ned saying "ive never struggled with anything so hard in my life" not having a consensual workplace relationship 😭
ned saying "ive never struggled with anything so hard in my life " bro loving ur wife😭😭
Anyone watching this after seeing Ned cheated
I guess Alex took Eugene's thought of the wedding being the death of your single life seriously, forgetting she had a whole ass fiancé.
Watching this again n knowing the current situation breaks my heart 😭😭😭
Keith's dress could have really been haute couture if a high fashion designer did it. like it really had a lot of potential
do you guys know when did Ned stop mentioning his wife in their videos?
Ned creating wedding dress for his mistress, Alex.
Disappointed to see Ned in this video. Seeing him just pisses me off now. I'm so glad they got rid of him and started editing him out of their videos.
Ned just has too much love in his heart ig
i cant believe hank cheated on his wife, that's crazy
*sigh* Well..... This aged great....
There's not enough love for Zach in this video, he was hilarious!
Zack is my spirit animal
This aged well Ned
17:03 I think Ned struggled a little harder with fidelity
Just like real nipples… no, real nipples do not just rip off 😅
Try guys try making their own cosplay
"I love weddings and my wife.." Hits different now, doesn't it? Naughty Ned.
Kinda want to see them try their hands at quincenera dress either trying them on or making them
alright who's here since... yknow
Eugene's dress is GORGEOUS. I want it
Ned corrected Zach by saying he loves lord of the rings MORE than he loves his wife 😢
This aged well
POV: You came here looking for the try wives/girls video where Alex tried on wedding dresses but they deleted it
Yeah I had an Amazon wedding dress because I had a military Covid backyard wedding. The reception wasn’t even fun. 👍
i hate that what Ned did is making everyone question everything he said or did in past videos. This is so sad.
17:04
Ned correcting what Zach said and saying that the only 2 things that he loves in this world are weddings and The Lord of the Rings, really hit different now. 😔 I feel incredibly bad for Ariel and their kids.
Can't believe Keith heard wedding and came out dressed like a baked potato
“I love two things: weddings and Lord of the Rings”    That aged well.
I LOVE Eugene's dress!!!!! He's so talented.
lmao ned not mentioning his wedding or wife in this vid is so telling now that the truth is out. i think they were prob separating and gonna announce it but then the pics/vid was leaked
The fact that Zach said that the two things Ned loved were weddings and his wife, and then Ned changed it to weddings and Lotr is telling...
Can’t believe they knew about Ned and Alex when this was filmed
“Ned lives two things- weddings and MY WIFE” … watching this in September of 2022…😢
Oof. Watching this now and Ned specifically saying his two favorite things are LOTR and weddings, and not Ariel.... he ruined so much.
Can't watch ned now..
guys i just remember that when i first watched this, the part when Zach immitated Ned saying "my name is Ned I love two things weddings and my wife" and Ned went along but like said "I love two things weddings and LOTR" - he did not try to include the "my wife" part which was super off brand for him. i was a little confused at the time because i thought it would be funnier and more like Ned if he said like "i love two things weddings and LOTR.. and my wife" something like that. it was his brand so i didn't understand why, especially because he went along with Zach who did say "my wife" ,but i didn't think about this much. now looking back maybe because Alex was on set and he didn't want to say that to make her feel upset or something? because in the past im sure Ned would find a way to include/mention his wife in everything.  anyway i cant re watch try guys old videos without feeling uncomfortable. i cant even look at ned 😭
This aged beautifully
'Consensual workplace relationship ' 🙄🤮
maybe try creating a chair?
I know I’m not the only one that’s incredibly disappointed in Ned and his mistress. I’m not saying her name. Sending Ariel and the kids love and prayers for healing.
why are personified and terrified looking cartoon bananas playing instruments? Also, why did that make me so happy?
Watching the try guys is not the same anymore. I constantly get annoyed when Ned appears on screen.
Who else is watching this after finding out Ned sucks at marriage?
He loves two things, he said 😒 and "my wife" isn't one 😭
youtube kept recommending this to me after the news broke out.........
ned really did love lord of the ring more than his wife😢
Fuck watching this after the whole Ned being an adulterous b*tch hurts so much 😭
Eugene’s dress is stunning
I love how Zach knows he may not win but still has fun.
I watched this a day before the cheating stuff was released… a last good moment
I love Keith’s enthusiasm and creativity. He just goes for it and that’s so cool
Ned: “Put me on a sailboat and push me out to sea” Everyone now: “gladly”
Keith looks like Mr. potato head and I can’t 😂
They need to try making divorce dresses for Ariel
This aged well for ned😢
Claim your "Here after Ned left the most amazing women in the world for a piece of shit" ticket. Alex ain't engaged anymore after this-
it's amazing to notice that, the best dress came from the guy who hates weddings
Church bell? More like Taco Bell 😂
Ned love weddings? Mhm mhm
… So I see we’re all here after all the… ehmm, *events* that have taken place…
Zach: Ned loves two things, weddings and “my wife”  Me now, Sept 2022: Ned loves two things, weddings and cheating
4:44 🥲
well well well fancy seeing you here to witness the irony known as ned
22:55 now😬
Guess Ned loves three things now:  Weddings, his wife, and a consensual workplace relationship
“Ned is too in his element today. He looooooves weddings” yeah well good thing because he’ll probably end up having another one
oh no oh no watching this after ned admitted to having a consensual workplace relationship and seeing the comments at about 4:30 is so funny
For someone who loves weddings so much, Ned was quick to ruin Alex's future wedding.
aaaaaand this video  didn't age well, my bad luck I'm this bad luck I'm this far behind on my subscribed videos
Ned talking about how much he loves weddings while ruining his own marriage 😭
Ned loves his wife…..enough to cheat on her 😢
Well this didn't age well 😳
Eugene is so good at drAwiNF
the irony
Being here after what happened is hilarious
Ned loves weddings and cheating on his wife. 🤬😡 so disappointing.
Why hasn’t Alex also been let go? If you’re going to punish Ned and not her as well
23:00 oof the fact that he said what you hope a wedding to last and Eugene’s reaction. Also earlier 4:40 when Zach imitated him “I LoVe My WiFe” and Ned said “I love weddings and.. LOTR”
@4:48 this hits different now
12:21 Happily, Ned.
Yeah you know why
Oof Ned, oofs...
“Ned loves his wife” ooof. That didn’t age well.
I would actually wear Eugene's dress
"Ned loves two things. "Weddings and mY WiFe." oof
Dishonor on you, Ned. Dishonor on you, the woman he cheated with.
I would wear Eugene's dress. I love it
You are a disappointing man, Ned. I grew up with my father cheating and that cheating you did? your children will carry that in their life once they get old.
Well this aged like milk
Me, hearing the most recent news. 😬
Should have known something was up when he said he loved Lord of the Rings and not his wife💀
This episode didn't age well.
This one is tough to watch knowing what we know now…
Can Eugene try RuPaul’s Drag Race ?! Because this dress is givingggggggggggggg
I think they should replace Ned with Ariel.
It sucks but you could kinda tell something was up... Ned used to mention being married, how much he loved his wife and just Ariel in general any chance he got  It's been a while where he hasn't really been the same 💔 heart goes out to Ariel Hope Alex and Ned get the worst fucking karma
I'm honestly gonna miss these episodes Edit but still fuck you Ned//Alex
That did not age well... 4:40
Funny I’m watching this today :(
As much as I like Eugene's dress, I just think it is like any other fashionable dress's designs. However I absolutely loved Ned's dress and Jack's top part. For Keith, that is one hilarious dress🤣
I love the wedding gown designer Matthew in this. He has such a great personality and sense of humor, and genuinely looks like he's enjoying being there. He was very kind in his judging and gave genuine compliments too.
Zach could not have been more Lana del Rey vinyl ✋🏽
It's almost as if Ned is always a bridesmaid, but never the bride
The moment I saw Eugene’s sketch, I was like oh mah gurd
love Neds Concept because I would've loved to have been to that same wedding
Wedding guest: *Scoff* "What are you? A bell?" Bride in Keith's dress: *Tearfully* "Yes I am, thank you for noticing."
When Eugene and Matt eventually marry Eugene should totally wear this black wedding dress and Matt a white or silvery tux. Would be a neat swap on the traditional wedding attire of black tux and white dress.
Can anyone tell me why designers are obsessed with putting clothes on a broom and not a person when sketching? Anyone??
I always love how much they support each other through the process. Let's normalize this attitude when in competition.
32:40 this shot is just hilarious
This would’ve been hilarious if you had Micara Tewers as a guest judge
Totally gave Four Weddings vibes at the final judging
Where do dresses have seams?  Well, where have you found zippers?  Lol!
Eugenes Dress is so cool.
I WISH I had a sword at my house.  I also really appreciate the idea of having a sword belt on my wedding dress, so I do kinda like Neds for his general idea. I just really don't want to have a white wedding dress.  In all seriousness I'd LOVE Eugenes dress for my wedding! It's amazing and I just love black more than white. Like, if it has to be a wedding dress, why not something amazing in black?  Zach tried, and I appreciate trying to make a wedding dress that's cozy but it is a miss for me.  And then there's Keith.... Well, it's something but it's a damn lot actually. Again, not my style, more like a fun idea not a great dress to wear it looks like.   I think I would have been fine with either Ned or Eugene winning, but can't say I'm not really happy that Eugene made it out on top :D
eugene the princess we all needed
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I would unironically put Ned's dress on my list of potential wedding dresses, especially with the green belt (sword optional)
"is no one else starting with drawing -- wait, Eugene is starting with drawing, that's why I'm doing it!" 😭😭😭
I want to see these dresses recreated by the judges and professionally modeled please
Bell could have like. Put a belt on!
Omg Keith’s reveal literally made me lol 😂
Keiths end speech. Fabulous
Absolutely love Ned's gown!!!
Eugene’s take on weddings is close minded Idk why he would think like that
Cotton is not a fabric. It is a fiber and can be a lot of different weaves and knits
I kinda want to see a season of without instructions or without a recipe where the professionals who have judged in the past come back as contestants and the guys are the judges
Neds dress literally would have been my dream wedding dress
Keith should design dresses for gypsy brides 😂
I just wish someone would’ve grabbed some lace and tied it underneath Keith’s chest and BOOM it would’ve looked super cool
Keith roaring ”That’s fucking rude bitch!” without hesitation and turning literally red made me spit out my tea
Ned's gown touches my druid soul.
ngl i thought i was going insane when i realized eugene had more makeup on his face then before
its always eugene and ned
Congo congo my dearest hyung eugene ...complete goth bride vibes were the best... Rest, Well done try guys,they too have created bridal dresses ❤
I THINK YALL SHD TRY TO MAKE MINIATURES
15:42
15:05
12:52
Keith's section had me in tears
Eugene seems like Cristina yang from grey’s anatomy if u know u know it if u can see it u know it
Keith's dress is basically a balenciaga dress
oh my god i absolutely love ned’s so much, considering how messy the process was for him lol ❤😂 also shoutout to keith as a literal bell, that dress and the entire persona just made me feel so joyful ✨😂
Omggg Keith 😂😂 you had me wheezing so baaad don’t ever change please 😂😂😂😂 we luv you
Keith may not look like the bride but he definitely looks like a bridesmaid
why did they blur out Zach’s nips?!?! 🤣🤣🤣15:08!
NEXT SEASON PLEASE!! And I'm soo impressed with Eugene's sketch!!
"Straight people are crazy" Me every single day when I see that one couple at college-
Eugene's cleave design 🥵👌🏻🤌🏻
still betting on black aye
Keith looked as if he was playing Mrs Turnblatt in Hairspray.
How did I sew my dress to the Machine- That had my laughing so hard
ding dongg
Here's an idea -The try guys try dyeing hair (just hand them dye and bleach BUT it should be crazy colours from pictures on pinterest or something) -the Try guys try interior design -the try guys try crazy facial masks
Watching this as somone who works in the alterations industry this video walks the line between hilarious and absolutely horrifying
how in the world did they get BLACK LACE  WHERE I NEED IT
That animated banana orchestra has me rolling.
I swear they have to just edit it to make it look like Eugene was struggling.
Eugene, showing off a black wedding dress with a cape *Safiya Nygaard has entered the chat*
They should try tuxes now.
Feels like Eugene is cheating because Eugene has Eugene to model his dress 😃🖤
30:35 : "I think it brings joy". Me flashbacks to Marie Condo.🤣
KEITH’S BANANA BOUQUET IS  E V E R Y T H I N G
Zach wanting it to be the most comfortable day of your life is a mood honestly
LMAO NEDS BEARDDDDD AHHHH
With a smaller bell bottom or a ribbon around Keith’s waist it woulda looked great. Hand sewing is tedious and I lived for his neckline
This was great! And Zach was killing me at the end 😆 "Won't be an accident"
You guys are so embarrassing, I can’t believe they had to make a disclaimer that Keith is joking.
i love that the sketches aren't such skinny models for the dresses
Neds dress is absolutely incredible wtf He made it sound like it was gonna be a disaster but the design, the sewing technique were all on point. I LOVED the green accents with the crown and the belt. And the WIG 😩  Everything about the look was gorgeous! He could totally be a fashion designer if he wanted!
at this point im just surprised Keith didn't find a way to add raisins to the dress
Eugene's is genuinely amazing
Well if try guys fail, Ned and Eugene can open a fashion label
Something tells me Ned wanted to be the bride
lowkey tired of lauren on these sometimes
Keith's giving Penelope Featherton
Idea! "Try guys love in tiny homes for one week" ☺️
Okay now I'm confused. I went a few months not watching, last thing I remember. Didn't Zach and Maggie's brakeup? Now they are getting married? Much confusion lol
I actually need to stop reading the comment while watching cause I keep spoiling things for myself😭😭
"I don't read" You and Lea Michelle both Keith, you and Lea Michelle both
Any bride at the Renaissance Faire would be happy with Ned's gown, and edgy dark bride would be happy with Eugene's gown, BUT make Eugene's gown white and any bride could rock it at their wedding.
29:10 that literally killed me.
This one of the funniest episode I've ever watched. I laughed so hard 🤣 I was crying.
How on earth did ned do that like it’s actually good
Sooo did sad bananas playing instruments already exist as stock animations or did a try team member have to spend a day editing bananas?
My mom is self taught when it comes to sewing, she taught herself by making Barbie clothes in the 80s. At 23, she made her own wedding gown while also being basically broke, and it's still one of the prettiest gowns I've ever seen and I will never stop bragging about her skills.
Neds dress is litteraly so pretty i cant
I’m living for Matthew living for Keith’s monstrosity of a dress
I LOVE ZACH DRESS I WOULD WEAR THATS ON MY WEDDING!!!
Being a fan of the try guys I am so stoked to see Matthew Christopher as a guest judge! He's currently designing my wedding dress and has been a pleasure to work with!😊 He really knows what he's doing and I'm so glad they got him to judge this competition! Hope to see more of him in the videos!!!
I would love to be friends with Eugene.   He is the queen
Shoutout to Zach for coming up with the only idea of a wedding dress I would ever consider wearing
Truth be told, I liked the 4 dresses, I thought the Try Guys really did well for how little time they had to design and create their wedding dresses. Why is Keith eating his banana upside down, though ? 👀
"Say Yes to the Stress" is a great alternate title for this video.  Ding dong, wedding season is here.
Funny how the person that’s not a stylist or designer has the most to say.
i have not laughed so much and so hard, Literally tearing at the eyes during the wedding dress reveal. I love you guys and ALL the dresses were amazing! xD
Ned and Eugene have such opposing dress styles. They look so good
Funeral for the single life…. Damn Eugene made me crack 😂
Why has nobody mentioned Zack absolutely KILLING that wig?? Looking FIRE. What are these new feelings?!
Eugene's dress is a beautiful dress if everything got sown right
These judges were my favorite panel yet.  Their expectations were on the floor and they just seemed to have a great time!
i’ve legitimately sent my boyfriend a screenshot of ned’s gown as an inspiration for our own wedding.
WHO GAVE KEITH THE RIGHT TO BE SO FUNNY 😂🤣
Eugene's dress looks the best made but Zach's dress looks fun
I love that Eugene won because, personally, nonwhite wedding dresses are my absolute favorite!
Anyone else love the vibe of Roman and Eugene when they stood together
I agree with Lauren, I think if Keith had something under the bust or if it had something to cinch his waistline it would look that much better
The animations of the bananas ringing the bell and playing the violin just killed me, I hope Eugene attends my funeral in his wedding dress
eugene's sketch was frame-worthy. honey can draw!
THE WAY THEY BLURRED OUT ZACH'S NIPPS LMAO
The fact they have to put that reminder about Keith & Lauren being friends & they're just acting, makes me so sad. 🤦‍♀️
Eugene you have to have a funeral for your single life while getting married to your bf in that dress
Eugene and Ned are like the goth/cottagecore lesbian brides, and Keith and Zach are the strange princesses from distant lands there as their wedding guests
I freaking LOVE Eugene's dress!
Why does Zach look so good in that brunette wig?
I love lotr whenever I get married I want lord of the rings themed wedding
just started the video. 1 dollar that ned tried to recreate ariel's dress.
At 31.27 Zach laughing has me dyingggg lmao 🤣
Omg my stomach hurts from laughing🤣🤣🤣🤣 Keith is something else🤣🤣 So listen, while I am FLOORED by how beautiful Eugene’s dress is, I feel like Ned should’ve won this one. Even though it didn’t have the best execution, I feel like Ned’s dress embodies a wedding dress more so than Eugene’s more couture-like dress.
Keith's dress instantly reminded me of ariana grande's dress when she is performing just look up on voice
LOVE Neds idea I’d wear Eugene’s to my own wedding  That catch Keith made of the banana I watched over again like 20 times  And Zach.. well.. he tried 😅
If Eugene ever decides to get married I hope he wears a dress
why have I gone back to watch him catch the banana so many times?
Wow, they all did so much better than I thought they would. And oh my God! Eugene in that black lace gown holding a bouquet of calla lilies! He looks divine.  I like the judges judge the guys on the actual level they’re at. The judges did not expect them to be professional level. All of the comments made a lot of sense
I honestly would want Eugene dress if I ever got married. That's my dress
“It hugs ur girlish figure” ma’am - excuse me-
I’m ready for this video to stress me out
I’m with Keith on this, I love a giant skirt! If I could her away with wearing hoop skirts or panniers with layers and layers underneath, I totally would. Maybe not when it’s 100° out, but any other time.
That Keith explosive 🧨 moment on Laura was the funniest moment ever lmao 😂 had to rewind and watch it again and again
Undergarments!
Welcome to the Keith show... 🔔
I want Eugene's dress
Kieth describing his dress being wide and how no one’s done that before, it makes it so clear he’s never been to a quinceañera
Haven’t seen the final results yet but so far looks like Eugene should win
Watching this episode as a sewtress is both he'll and heaven, I cringe and laugh in delight
I know they did a cosplay video a while ago but I think it would be very cool if they did anyone one now and made it all themselves since they’ve worked with wigs and fabric and props. And it could be cool if they brought in a few small cosplay creators to help or judge
Eugene being perfect at anything to do with fashion is why my fashion design degree is sitting useless in my wardrobe
Keith’s dress made me really want a baked potato with some sour cream 🥔
D I N G   D O N G
Wish they got longer to make their stuff! I feel like it should be a correlation between how long it takes to make the real thing. It makes for great comedy but their creativity can't shine as much.
Keith: "I'd like a compliment"
DING DONG   😂😂
that glitch in the matrix on keith
Eugene's dress made me think Cristina in Grey's Anatomy
Why does Keith’s dress remind me of ruff ruffman from fetch 😂
The bananas 🍌 playing the instruments had me dying lol 😂
Can anyone tell me what the dark circles on Zach's back are? 14:20
Eugene literally made a dress for Ned’s nails!!!
LOTR 🥰
32:16 Love the banana animations!
This would be a stressful dream to do
The try guys should try to do resin art someday.
The guys all did fabulous jobs constricting the wedding but some of those judges were wack. Just saying 🤷‍♀️
Try guys try bell ringing
don't underestimate your clothing guys, there's a reason it took me 6 years and a degree to learn how to design eveninwear/wedding attire
Keith looks like a female genitalia anatomy diagram that you see in textbooks 😂
Eugene’s is a beautiful gown but if I saw it in a store window I wouldn’t think it was for a wedding.
The try guys make fursuits. Please. I want to see this.
“ I love two things,weddings  and lot of the rings”  Ned gets it
Are we just gonna ignore Zach at the end??!??!! IM CRYINGGG😂😂😂
As a black dress bride I’m obsessed with Eugene’s dress! I also loved Keith’s cause the use of color!!! I think they all did a great job! Yes even you Zach haha
The bit at the end where Lauren was telling Zach that any higher and he would be accidentally flashing a nut, made me giggle, but Zach saying that it wouldn't be an accident had me rolling 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keith is giving Penelope from bridgerton
okay i’m ngl i love keith’s
I’m honestly surprised how well they turned out
I think it's very charming that of course Eugene's good at everything, but Ned still makes a genuine effort to best him.
Ned looked so freaking cute while waiting for the judging
Keith is hella funny
Eugene is a moment
Eugene = "Death of a Bachelor"
I like how at the end of the video it shows the number of wins for each Try Guy! 😍
Its not like a banana, instead its like mangos without the skin🤣🤣🤣
Haha I was getting caught up on some Try Guy episodes and this is weird timing, because earlier I was contemplating if I could make my own wedding dress. I've altered one before (mostly cutting a train and hemming, sewing on embroidery remnants) and made accessory pieces and cloaks and lace armor and junk for a costume, but I've never made a full on wedding dress completely from scratch. I don't know that I could do it lol but it would be fun
I got SOOO excited to see Neds because my name is Arwen😂
"My advice is... Good luck!" Love that guy already
I love that Ned gives off gay energy without being gay 😂
As a fashion design major, I loved and hated this video at the same time 😂
Eugene always eats
Anytime I watch these videos, I find my face hurting when Keith is the focus. Apparently I'm not used to smiling and laughing so much...
Keith! 1965 Yves Saint Laurent Cocoon bridal dress  Look it up!!
A belt on the bell one
i’ve been searching for my dream black wedding dress and i think eugene just made it lol i would actually buy that for my wedding. no idea when the wedding is happening, currently engaged tho 😂
Keith looks more of a chicken nugget then a bell
Ned is the most consistent in the show lol
“You look like you shop at Chico’s” 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Keith's dress looks like if Belle wanted a maternity gown
The caption reminder that Keith and Lauren are friends KILLED me
Whilst actively planning my wedding, I am now adopting the phrase "say yes to the stress"
my mother got married to my father in an Éowyn inspired dress i have never resonated more with ned's idea   Edit: upon the reveal of new information I would like to share my parents are still together and in love
I love how they censor the 'fxxking' but not the 'bxxch' (29:15) 😆😂
“Flowers come right off, just like regular nipples”
Would love to see a Try Guys do drag without instructions / help!
Yawn. Quelle surprise.
Keith’s dress is giving minecraft baked potato..
Matthew 😍
Keith just lost it during his reveal
Ned gave me Breath of the Wild Princess Zelda
Keith's wedding dress looks like taco bells if they made any marketing for weddings like someone should photo shop him getting married at taco bell with like one of his shots of him eating taco bell from the eat everything at a fast food restaurant series
“all four of us wow” i love zach
Im watching this all late, but this is legit the best series on YouTube. Like these guys really know how to film and edit. Like bravo to the whole company
How did I immediately know exactly what Eugene was gonna say after he heard the garter story? 🤣🤣
i wish ned won that one!! i love his dress
always bet on black
I would wear Ned dress design for my wedding, Love it
You guys should try to do amigrumi stuffies
Keith’s dress is what you wear when you’re tryna hide a pregnancy
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤️ the creativity !!!! Laughed so much! 😂
EUGENE IS SO GOOD AT DRAWING???
I can't even explain how happy I am that Keith stopped doing the shouting when he lost... I know it was all to ham it up, but it made me SO uncomfortable and I hated it so much. Thank you for toning it down. I love this series! The silly dramatics are great!
Keith. That’s not an “old” tradition. It is so old but people still do it frequently
i would actually consider getting married in ned's dress, it is so pretty
neds gown is giving mormon realness
I kinda wish that they would get professionals to recreate all of the guys' designs as they were envisioned, not executed.
Eugiene reminds me of the bride from insidious
The dresses are amazing but I LOVE Zach's tshirt!! I need one
I love the sewing challenges so much
When is season two??
oh my Gourd!  Keith that dress 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤷‍♀️

Ove got one! Quilting without instructions!
I want characters out of neds and eugenes dresses so they can get married together
I want the judges to react to them doing the making process !!!
Ned's dress is on point, he looks amazing in it!
I’m living for Keith’s dress hahaha he did a great job creating a bell.
Keith is my favorite he’s so funny
Matthew's sense of humor was my favorite part, sometimes experts take this too seriously and he was able to fit in with the try guys
oh my god those banana musicians! i love em 🤣💛🍌
I love the two guest judges!!!
I love how serious Eugene is about the dress
When I was like in high school or my early 20s I always dreamed of a full on goth vampire themed wedding where all the decors looks like I'm in a gothic castle with lots of blacks and reds, a gothic black wedding dress with that ballet dress material (that sheer flowy ballet dress material) that is knee length in the front and has a train in the back, a black tiara and black veil that doesn't cover my face (is only long in the back), maybe some fake vampire wings, red colored drinks and foods and some those realistic food art (I'll make it shaped like brains and stuff). The music would be the mix of those like dramatic and dark ballroom music/vampire-ish instrumental music playlist on youtube and rock music.  Eugene's dress actually reminds me of my dream wedding.  I no longer want to marry but I still want to wear gothic wedding dress.
Love Eugene but he gives me Bianca Del Rio vibes. Knows her silhouette.
Keith is giving Fanny Brice
Keith is giving Fanny Brice
i'm getting married in january. is it weird that i wanna change my gown design bc of eugene? 😭🤣
I was concerned when we got Eugene's drawing bcs its very childs first witch halloween costume but he made a dress that absolutly rocked
As someone alternitve and wants a black wedding dress, im absolutely IN LOVE with Eugenes dress.
Keith killed me during his reveal, I have never laughed so hard before 😂😂😂
NED HAS COME SO FAR! I love LOTR and I love that dress wow so impressed with the time he had
I think this should be like Maggie has to wear the dress of Whoever wins
Everyone having a sword :'))
Not Eugene giving my inspo for a new burlesque costume😅
LMAO Keith explained the garter thing and I was sitting there like: Eugene is gonna say “straight people are crazy” or something now and 🤣
Ok but Eugene should have designed Safiya Nygaard's reception dress 👀
The more I'm watching this the more I'm thinking of Micarah Tewers
Elf!Ned could like...get it😏😏
Keith was so close
Idk why but each of these makes me think they’re getting married at different ages Zach: 21-23 either they’re hs sweethearts or they met in college Ned: 27 they met at Comic-Con or maybe an Internet forum Eugene: 37 has been with the person 10+ years so this is just a formality Kieth: 45 this vow renewal is so fun she has a reveal! There’s a dress she looks GREAT in underneath this
