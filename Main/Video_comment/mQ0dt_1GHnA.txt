I didn't know the Sweet brew Water breathing and Dense brew existed in Minecraft Dungeons.
The keys in Minecraft Dungeons are funny but sad. To pick them up you press "X" which is also how to attack and when you get to the door and press "X" they straight up disappear in thin air and they have a mouth and eyes and they're on you're back while picked up. If you take damage they try to run away frantically and look petrified while they're on you're back. And like Block Facts said, they'res only a blue and yellow one usually the blue one is to open up the door to the yellow one. Also if one dissapears it teleported back to where it spawned.
They forgot to say the Double Sided Axe is still here today. Its in Minecraft Dungeons.
how do you make those medicines?
Meh

Why mojang removed the quiver and tried to add again in 2015 but decided not too?
Why I can't get these paintings anymore?

Why this player broke one block from the house and break this glass thingy?
Why the skis were removed and Mojang had tricked us all?

well now i need to make a mod
Look like some man hunter is sad for footprint is removed.
balloons are still in game
Do you have quiver’s in bedrock
My stomach made a sculk sensor noise while watching this video
800 quadrillion items yet you can think of items that dont exist in the game
Yo scrolls is still up
I REALLY hate that the education edition has most of the items and stuff that should be in Java for a long time... I guess they are just too stupid to add them
isnt this block facts?
i just relised hes british like me
I have minecraft dungeons and a playstation so i didnt need any of the other stuff like the key thing
Poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooôoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooop
I might be wrong but the red, yellow and blue door keys might be a reference to Doom, the classic games used a texture for door keys that is really similar and those are the colours of the ones you can get
thx for teaching me for my science test
Why did it removed?
Wait....what if we combine banana and balloon
I was born in 2012, I don’t know did ruby and pigmen village removed?
I know about garbage that I accidentally used(I knew about it before the video) me and my sister were expermenting it.
I knew that disc 11 had something to do with the warden
I love how leather armor was *cloth armor.*
6:25 I guess we'll "NETHER" know
7:57-- nostalgic
Horse leather armour is still craftable afaik :0 Awesome video !
we need the camera back it will help us to make memories in the geme
There are balloons in minecraft education edition

Potassium Pickaxe
THE BRITISH ACXENT LOL
Balloon is in edjecashon
The Ballon Was Made In Education Edition
Um... i tried the education edition
First how does he get the items
Well some of these things are accessible through education addition!
I hacked but on my friends world I found this weird photo thing spawn egg I tried it it takes a picture and you can put it on your photo it works for mobile is still on Minecraft
Almost all of the removed item was sent to Minecraft Dengeons or the other server games.
i started mimecraft in 1984
Nahchos... Bruh
why does your avatar look like Alpharad?
I hack minecraft with tool box but i found the camera block
The education edition ones are still here
Ballon’s did not go away
7:23 lol if you pay attention closely the blocks spell Poo.
Block facts really made elephant toothpaste gone from Minecraft
Oof.
The balloon is still in game???
i can make the battle axe in cave game oh and there’s this new game called minecraft everyone is talking about but i’m sticking with cave game.
Only true ogs remember ruby's and the original fish
Honestly, the balloon item sounds very fun ngl
EXCUSE ME!? I WAS BORN IN 2012
Add all please
horse armour is still craftable but only leather
Balloons are still here its just in a different thing that has those  Letter b!ocks
The balloon is still in the game but you need to activate educational mode on pocket and bedrock
If the balloon was not removed i think it would be good for bedwars/pvp
Your so noisy
2:53 They removed it because they quickly realize there's a fifth, ice. Lol.
Bleach in Minecraft Education Edition poisons you 🤮🤮🤮
I just did a number twenty seven while watching this
W are you putting dream smp members
8:00 honestly I used to like the fish back then, cods are just boring
He wears a wig? 7:28
The signs in the VR headset kinda look like the ones in system if a downs byob whenever the people are wearing them
It's wild hearing you talk about "you only got fish from fishing, no specific types like cod or salmon" and "you crafted chainmail with fire" like it's some far off, bizarre concept because I remember when that was just normal. I feel old now and I'm only 19
Not true-  Balloons can be made in Minecraft.  You just need to turn on Minecraft education edition   I’m doing it right now!
You forgot about Is flame ore and apple    Frame
ohhh that i why i think the cod was supposed to be blue...
Minecraft has apples, berries, and melons...  Carrots, cocoa, and beetroot : *Sobs*
Scrolls is called Caller’s Bane now and it does exist, and it has a small but fairly active community.

I wish it was still there:(
I mean we might be getting sleds in 1.19 so yea

Some sort of ban on talking about Notch? Mojang came after Minecraft, not before it.
How do I get on education ????????    Oliver
Him: Bleach is not available in Minecraft Me in Bedrock edition: Are u sure about that
3:21 Quiver is also in Bedrock Edition, but not as an item, it's part of player's skin, and it's 3D but don't do anything (sorry for my English)
3:21 there are 3 Quivers flaming Quiver, Torment quiver (needs souls) I don’t remember the other
1:33 Oh no I did not like Diamond Dust! You had to buy it from the blacksmith luckily the blacksmith merchant now upgrades items
0:17 the banana pickaxe probably was going to be mixed with the golden pickaxe code
I was playing bedrock beta and got a glowstick in a woodland mansion chest. It doesn't have a texture associated and it just sits in an item frame on my wall.
I have the Xbox one edition so I can play the glider mini game
0:43 47?
Dont click read more                 Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you
In Minecraft Education Edition you can make balloons and glow sticks and other things with no mods
BRUH BEDROCK EDITION ALSO HAS GARBAGE
L don't understand he just rap🤣🤣🤣
I remember when Fish was still in the game
Hey but why did bedrock editions can craft balloons ? 😀
Wait but if it is called enchanted golden apple that mean the enchanted book and  a golden apple!…….
So what I’m getting out of this is that education edition is better then the normal game
I realised that he is wearing a FAKE hair with his hair

incorrect balloons are real dummy
well mojang didn't stop me from teaming up in the mini battle games on my ps4
Actually the rubies texture of the ore was too close to the emerald ore but when they added emeralds to the game it was the rubies by accident
Pepto-Bismol canonically exists in Minecraft
:)

How do you know minecraft dungeon
The lapis icon is different in the enchanting table in Minecraft 1.18

You can make a balloon but it just hard
Balloons not banned from Minecraft

Balloon didn’t get removed

If ur an bedrock player u will keep wishing for playing Java edition
My name is jeb but not the rainbow sheep from Minecraft
in xbox 360 it was used to set the gamemode mid game instead of in the menu is my best guess otherwise in the glide minigames it was just the sprite for chooseing it
Me seeing banana (in the thumbnail):             *P   O   T   A   S   S   I   U   M* *KRIS GET THE BANANA*

minecraft: Let's remove all these useful items. minecraft dungeons: *can I have it*
1:52 "Well, so today, we are going to mess around with some crystalized honey." -Mcyum     Well, I guess he said that...
Unfortunately It is not used
Bananas are Berries
In the 3d shareware you had the obligatory nightmare mode and it was the first dificulty and oldest.
so the nether pearl would be for you find structures and give fire resistence for  30 seconds
Mark rober

I wish these items will return to Minecraft
So fish cod and slamon could be cool but if mojang add the fish back that be so yeah heh
What's so good about diamonds
I had one of my capes removed.
Why does the new redstone ore look like the same color as the ruby
There is so many old and new memes in this block fact video
You can get the balloon in education addition
Finally now I know I'm not the only person who remembers crystalized honey!
So you wear a wig😍
I still find it really bizarre for the fact that we can't craft saddles... Seriously, the recipe would be EASY to make... I mean, I get it. They're a more rarer item that shouldn't be unlocked at the beginning of the game, but still...
I vaguely remember a specific version where you could use the /give command to get fire
5:23 Lol classic 🤣👌
mining with potassium
You can do elephant toothpaste on the bedrock version of education edition
There is still a camera in pocket edition you just ty /give @s Camera

Wait....Earth,air (wind), fire and water. So wait does the paintings resembles avatar the last airbender
I think the quiver is an achievement for the game
Bananas are berries.
i remember the old fish texture
In bedrock 1.17 you can craft leather horse armor at least that
We may not have 1.16.. but here in mcee, we have *Balloons, bleach, medicine,* and so much more plus its free for any students man yall are missing out gtg make pigs fly!

Fun fact I just had a ad about minecraft lego
I have also got balloons btw in education
I have seen the game SCROLLS
L
Fun fact: I havent watched the entire video but still, the balloon exists. You just have to mix stuff on the science table thingies, if you click on a mob with the balloon on ur hand, it will fly
All of this pleas mojang pleas 🥺 make it back
How to put the balloon on fence?
1:04 the VR goggles we're making all the signs say obey and stuff. That is a reference to a movie called they live.
Photo of the developers 11:08
Ummm i need Bleach pls i saw Slender no chothes 👄
"There was gonna have a banana but it got removed."  ... Kris get the banana

Elephant toothpaste is still in Minecraft education edition
I think Minecraft needs more fruits and veggies cuz there's not a lot
i want the dog disc
The quiver isn't that removed because it's a back accessory
At least i have a ps3 so i can use the iron and diamond elytra
2:54 avatar reference
Why were banks removed? That could have meant monkeys could soawn
Fun Fact, the balloon item is only available in Minecraft Education Edition, and Minecraft Bedrock worlds with Cheats and Education Edition enabled. However, you cannot find it in the creative menu. You must craft it.
Listen to 0:08 very closley
You can make balloons in education editon
I can agree that trash can is my nightmare.
Those keys are from doom wtf
One second after I saw your commercial with you in it
Fun fact. The vr vision with the "obey" signs are a reference to the cult classic "They Live"
Good old days of the Consol edition so many good memories with my cousin who’d always beat my ass at the mini games
LoL
5:12 :)
I need banana in Minecraft
SERIOUSIY !!!!!!!!! A BANANA PICKAXE !!!  i like that idea they should of added it !!!!!!!!!!??????
Using the banana pickaxe to break diamonds realistically the banana would just splat
This was a science video
The chain armor was made with fire because Mojang knew it couldn't be found. They later changed it to be completely uncraftable.
Kris, GET. THE. BANANA.
Wat is The Office
You just have to craft them
Well you can still get balloons
The subtitles at 5:29 :D
Hey, balloons are still in minecraft
Fun fact: you can still get balloons in minecraft

#loverhacks
There's a brand new disc called Otherside.
I absolutely love minecraft but some of the workers who make the items and game need to actually add some of these great ideas into minecraft to keep the community alive.
Ucan craft Ballon
the diamond iron elitra was and still is in the xbox 360 version. the texture is used for the mini game
Today the 1.19 update will add: Allay Frogs Fireflies AKA: The Wild Update

R.I.P og fish 😢

*kris, get the banana pickaxe*
hearing that console mini games music takes me back
If Diamond Dust was worth 1000 emeralds, personally I think it should increase the enchantment things by a number between 5 and 100 not by 1. It's super rare to get 1, and probably impossible to get 1000 emeralds
Btw, the Diamond and grey elytra was used in the menu selection screens for the Legacy Minigames, justletting you know ;)

Zombie Pigman Egg: UM?
This some interesting stuff...
Omg the trashcan is scary
I really feel like someone should make a mod with ALL of these ideas from this video and previous/future videos of yours listing all these scrapped/removed ideas...  Imagine if the trash icon was remade into a mob that hunts down and eats dropped items... Would defiantly be annoying if you die and drop everything then return to see it eating everything, making them lost forever...

You know you can still craft enchanted golden apples in Minecraft Xbox 360 edition
I recognised the diamond-iron elytra as a gui icon in the console edition elytra minigame, so I doubt it was intended to be an item. The other icons for the other mini-games were also diamond-iron tools.
Id really like to the elephant toothpaste to be readded yknow id be cool for it have features like cleaning banners polishing stone or even being used as drink for health boost and or a new effect like refresh or something like it
thumbnail banana ballon me: BLONS TD 6
I remember the fish one lol
The banana pickaxe doesn't exist because the world isn't ready for it
the Iron/Diamond Elytra was the main menu icon for the glider minigame, not an actual item  Also, footprints aren’t unused, they show up when you drink an invisibility potion (at least in 1.8.9, it may have been removed)
Sominominoms ay ay

This is the best use of audience retention i have seen it is incredible how you keep attention for so long!  I didnt even realise i wanted to go to bed because i was so intrigued dude
In the custom minecraft texture maker app You can see some of these things are customizable still years after they were removed
Block facts is the most interesting chemistry teacher in the world

I Love Minecraft but it makes me sad that they got rid of so many things that are cool
Ballon Still on minecraft Bedrock Education edition u can Make It
It's actually pronounced "moyang," if you're going by the Swedish pronunciation.
there once was turtle armour that gave you water breathing and aqua affinity, and it was as strong as leather armour but a bit more durable.
so sad these were removed, stuff like this would’ve made lazing around in creative mode much more fun tbh
I think they should add a tropical island biome that forms over by coral reefs, they could include palm trees and bananas.
7:49 this item is still in bedrock edition when the classic texture pack is on, (still called cod though)
I wasn't even born on 2012
i actually remember me using balloons in bedrock addition good times but it was removed i hope mojang will add them back so as the other great ideas
Balloon u can make in education edition

Now the doubt: If we play worlds with removed items in newer versions, what would happen?
You want to know why they got rid of those paintings because The last air bender Would of sued them
Some of these were really cool and funny, so sad they removed it

They should of kept the stinky potion  And it should make it when you drink it dogs are attracted to you and if a player is 5 blocks or less away from you for 10 seconds they start suffercating
People who make texture pack mods & more items mods: WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!!

Fear God death is happening and you will die in the end Jesus is a Muslim, and he is alive in the sky, god raised him so he would send him to kills the Antichrist,  Jesus did not crucifie, but you are delusional about someone else, the devil wants you to enter hell, and I want you to be guided and I want you to go to heaven , may God guide you God has no son, he does not need a son, he has everything in heaven and earth, he is God alone, he has no partner, he is the Great And capable of everything look for the truth, just follow the truth .
Block Facts: Earth, Fire, Water and **Wind** Me: Earth, Fire, Water, **Air**. Long ago the four nations lived in harmony. Everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Only the avatar, the master of all four elements could defeat them. But when the world needed him most, he vanished.
2:42 -Fun- Sad Fact: minecraft earth was shut down due to the pandemic

When you said "Cameras" i remembered the older versions of minecraft Bedrock/mobile users (Basically the same thing) had to use plug PE. And Cameras were the only way to get charged creepers without having to wait 20 hours for a thunderstorm to strike a creeper.  Plus the old fish texture was so amazing to see again, we always made "Aquariums" We threw fish on the ground and used pistons to push glass over it then used sticky pistons to hide it until it got opened by a lever.
Balloons is in minecraft e education addition
I remember the camera and I used it a lot of times
3:47 WHY IS STAMPY IN SECOND PLACE HES SUPPOSED TO BE IN FIRST

Banana pickaxe isn’t enough. I want the real banana.  Yet neither exist
S
bundles are kind of like quivers
Anybody else see that the Dream smp was there?
Hi block facts
Man this is a ton of editing
Things from Minecraft Dungeons don't count and neither do textures added but never used. They have to have been added for them to be removed. I don't even get why Nachos count as being removed. It was an idea that wasn't even worked on. I could just say poop was removed because players requested it but the devs didn't work on it by that logic. Knowledge book doesn't count as removed because it is still in the game and the definition of REMOVED is no longer in the game. And items that had removed recipes still exist so they are not removed. How does balloon even count? It is in the education edition. Nothing happened to it. Nothing. If something needs to be in the Education edition to be considered removed then just list everything Education has but the Normal game doesn't as removed. SAME WITH THE DUNGEON POTIONS. They did not get removed.
I fking knew that disk 11 was sounds of somone running/mining away from the warden
the balloon is still obtainable in minecraft education edition on bedrock EDIT: the camera is still obtainable out of education edition on bedrock
me: sees tommy in london hugs him saying im a... Fan~
Need to make your own Minecraft game called mine block where you make every deleted mob in there and everything and even make your stuff
Banana
It’s annoying that somebody’s rare item was removed because people were too Salty.
What If knowledge Book can teach you crafting a Bed rock
2:12 the plus was probably for making worlds
He gives me Stampylonghead vibes and I love it
Skies  😲😲😲
Dammn long time no see
Hmm. The balloon seems familiar… Ah yes! Education Edition!
History Lessons China has a long history of divine culture. During the Sui Dynasty, for example, five plague gods were seen above the capital city in 592. A major plague then broke out that year, causing a high number of deaths. The Emperor of Wendi, a strong believer of Buddhism, ordered more temples to be built and encouraged his subjects to strengthen faith in and worship the divine.  Such a tradition continued to recent China. Xuyun (1840 – 1959), one of the most renowned monks in recent Chinese history, had lived through five emperors in the Qing Dynasty until communist China.  During the war with Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, Emperor Guangxu together with Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi’an of Shaanxi Province in August, and Xuyun was invited to join. It was summer and plague broke out, leaving many people dying, with rotting corpses throughout the city. In addition to advising the emperor to call on the wealthy for donations as a remedy, Xuyun also vowed to pray at Wolong Temple for mercy from the divine to end the plague.  Nearly 1,000 monks joined the event and Xuyun led nine of them to continue praying at a ten-yard high platform. Seven days into the ceremony, snow fell. Other monks returned to inside the temple, with only Xuyun remaining at the platform. He continued meditating, praying for additional snow to alleviate the damage caused by the drought and plague in the region. More snow arrived, and everywhere was covered with snow. Impressed by the miracle and sincerity, Empress Dowager Cixi came kneeling down on the snow in front of the platform to thank Xuyun.  But all the divine culture was wiped out after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949. In early 1951, for example, officials in Hunan Province required all nuns to get married in days, while young monks were forced to join the army. Xuyun, already over 110 at the time, was targeted as a counter-revolutionist. When the Buddhism Association of China was established in 1952 and CCP officials promoted monks and nuns to get married and stop their vegetarian diets, Xuyun attempted to intervene. As a result, he was detained with no food, water, or access to a bathroom. Military police officers also beat him and broke his ribs.
The monkey motivator is quite possibly the most tragic piece of cut content in history

Finally a new Video 😄😄
Mojang when they promised a feature 9 years ago: bro wdym
we need those goddamn balloons
Banana
feels weird watching it landscape than portrait
Mojang should add a splash/lingering potion that can be thrown behind somebody and it’ll show their footprints until the potion wears off
The monkey motivator was a minecraft dungeons concept
I know how to get balloons
The background music reminded me of warm 2015 nights playing spleef on my xbox
Balloons are in The Education Edition and can be crafted with the helium chemical. Like if you didn't know.

This is to everyone who looked at this and thought: EDUCATION EDITION SOUNDS FUN!  I was playing Minecraft survival with my friends to beat the dragon for the first time! I was collecting gold when my friend asked why. I told her, “We need gold for armour and trading with piglins!” She replied, “We are in education edition, AKA 1.14”
He`s back again for amazing videos
Fun fact: Ruby still exists in the game files
My biggest flex is that I still have the minigames on my ps3
Well, because this AM was that, again, it was actually, it was that, ok, you have to a new server to make this day a half that length to down a game of all time block challenge, but this books are really portant to say that this blocks things are actually going on with them, and after you make them, I actually make one, and my, I need I'm making new server, and there's a thing you are used to be using them to do something. I don't know, like being a scientist, I think so.

Maybe 2.1 moderation update? Question mark
How are you doing Mr.Block Facts
https://youtu.be/JJ4r4kYkn8Q .
You can use education edition to see a bunch of these!
Footprints could be useful if they were also added to mobs. Maybe you could use something to brew the “recon potion.” There should be more potions for scouting out players and mobs.
the background music in the later part of the video os actually from the glide mini-game he talked about!
Balloon is still here it’s in a different edition
I love the explaination it is because its very fast and always have a simple joke
I thought the rest of items were in 'unobtainable' or 'removed', it's just that you always put 2 different facts in one video
The iron and diamond elytra isn't unused it is the icon for the Elytra minigame

WE NEED MONKEYS   TAME THEM WITH BANANA     AND HAVE THEM FIGHT FOR YOU   they can use tools but no armor   also  50% of the time they spawn with wooden or stone tools  as if they are in the stone age
Good taste in ost

By the way education edition has the camera still
2:56 be like: only the minecraft, master of all four element paintings, could stop the ripoffs from happening, but when the world needed it most, it got deleted.

Alliances or not, we didn't care we would team up by slouching and if there were only 2 of us left, either one of us would sacrifice or there would be a cold-blooded battle between the two of us.    Thoses were the day.. And the experience was better since there was voice chat.

Please take some action on these YouTubers
Astronut #1: What his hair is a helmet? Astronaut #2: always has been Astronaut #1: dies  7:28
"Its raining cats and g Dogs" 😂 I love his puns
When he mentioned the Battle Minigames, a flood of nostalgia just drowned me.
Balloons are In education edition
To newcomers to minecraft - you cannot craft any horse armor now but you can still craft leather horse armor in a H shape in the crafting table.
Fun fact: you can already put lava on cauldron before 1.17 on bedrok edition
The Balloon Is In Education Edition
How is the quality on these videos so dam high?
I kinda want the camera back.
R.I.P Minecraft Earth...
Thick potion makes u thick

the trashcan looks like the arch and crafter
this video felt like both an hour and a second wth
Stop making. me want to get education edition...

I'm happy he talks about Bedrock and Java
I got fire block in minecraft from sand duper
Good vid
You can get balloons in education edition. And no elephant toothpaste is still in Minecraft Anything about education edition is still in bedrock but you have to be in creative.
I remember trying to figure out all of the items in ED MC with my friends LMAO
Why there remove it in education edition why
Cool!
If you were there when it was still called fish then you’re a legend
Some of these items I knew
3:51 forgot Wii u edition
Why is the McYum
ITEM FACTS
Do bananas have seeds cus if not then it's a vegetable
I want minecraft to add nachos. And cheese.
I’m number 312  (Yes I counted and am very very tired)
I remember that golden notch apple crafting recipe. 2 months ago I tried to craft that on my friends realm and they called me wise and deep in the old ways for trying to do that.
When education edition is a free version of minecraft but it has more features...
I swear you could be notch with all these facts and And WAIT HOW DO YOU FIND THEIR FILES??!
You can get balloons in Minecraft  but you got to make it.But you have to go in the Settings area
imagine liking dream
Would love to have skis. People would build ski resorts!
The footprints could work like it won’t leave footprints if you have bare feet. But if you have shoes it will leave footprints
LOL they called it crystalized honey instead of candied honey.
Who else knew about the doom reference?
He's back!!
I honestly love all of the videos you make for this channel, they’re very awesome :] Including this video!! amazing bideo :D
Anyone else notice dream giving george a rose?
The garbage can is gonna stare at me in my nightmares D:
Today instantly got better when I got the notification to this video
I just learned that his little hair spikes are  not part of his skin and they go in his helmet spot
Nice
The creativity is insane
5:12  Uhm block facts..
Artificial object with 6 side informational content
This makes me want to eat a potato, that’s not a good or bad thing it’s just potato
My favorite removed item is "Swaggiest Stairs Ever"
I’ll enjoy your videos once you stop putting references of the dream smp memebers in every second of the video, it’s honestly getting annoying
Not me checking every day to see if you’ve uploaded a new video 👀
I did the balloon
Good job with the videos they are really good
WOW. SO MANY FAMOUS YOUTUBERS IN YBIS VID
If you think about it, there is 1 type of medicine in vanilla Minecraft: Honey. Now, I learned this from a Bedrock thing called "The Way of the Bee," and the bee scientist (no, it wasn't an actual bee, it was a guy with a bee costume that could fly) said that honey can be used to cure poison (maybe nausea, idk). Plus, there's milk, but it removes every status effect on, so I won't count it.
He’s back!!
You can make footprints in normal minecraft you need to name a pare of boots very heavy
I watched Mark Robers elephant toothpaste experiment
fun fact: these items were removed.
Most education editions fetures are in bedrock edition because bedrock edition has a education edition button while creatung a world,thats why we have baloons
5:26 turn on subtitles it says ok I’m Hungry now
I still have balloons in my base tho....
My teacher let my class play Minecraft education edition so most the items in the video I know already and there very cool
Glad to have you back
6:37 what skin is that
I found a black glowstick in the green wool trap chest tnt room in a woodland mansion. Seed is 931100093, for bedrock. Woodland mansion is in the center of the map and on experimental there is a mountain that goes to y 260
The unused diamond and iron and diamond elytra was actually just the temporary icon in the game selection menu for the glide minigame. Still sad they removed those old minigames :( Edit: I forgot that they kept the servers up for the original ps3 and Xbox 360 versions of Minecraft. I had thought they shut the servers down after they converted those editions into modern day bedrock. Srry for the confusion.
2:00 Honeyhive Bomb xD
Does anyone else think this guy sounds like ESO the Elder Scrolls youtuber?
U literally have a hair piece
banana update -removed herobrine (i would not add it cause you now know)  - added monkeys -added bananas (duh) - added new ore (secret) -added banana village -cellphones will come out in the third of _____

Hi
Imagine Block Facts responding, that'd be fun
👍

My face when actually good videos
Gotta love bedrock where for some reason the ONLY 2 things you can put in your off hand are the shield and arrows for some reason so I always put arrows there because I’m an old player and always forget shields exist and are awesome
banana mincecaft

P

Hmmm  /pin @s

Actually it is possible to get cameras in normal Minecraft. My friend who is a coder managed to get the camera in survival as well as some cursed items. I also got fire but sadly couldn’t craft chain mail.
The monkey motivator is quite possibly the most tragic piece of cut content in history

Welcome back m8
I think im early   also block facts is so good at looking in the files and telling us in his own words such a great guy
i didnt even know about these, these are crazy
what about the nether reactor core
I have never been so interested in a video
Your videos are so entertaining, and you are definitely an understudy creator
“There are unique types of potions in Minecraft dungeons that you probably don’t know about”  Except that I played a little Minecraft dungeons, and they’re really common
I want banana pickaxe plz
Actually camera still available in Minecraft Bedrock Edition but you have to use NBT editor like Blocktopograph to get it
At 11:50, “Switness” and “strength” are not at the good place ...
I'm just sitting here crying in bedrock😭
Can we get a Education edition facts?      Love your vids keep up the good work :)
I have the enter armor card from the arcade machine!
Did you know that if you put glow stone and a water bottle in a brewing stand you get a thick potion
Hello! Cool!

You should do another video with Skip The Tutorial
You must have taken a long time to make this video right
Great work Block Facts!

I miss playing mini games, theres so much nostalgia
Block facts: Uploads   Everyone: Return of the king
ur vids are nice in 4k

Yay
People still ask for rubies to be added into the game for some reason, Maybe they just like the idea of it and not the thing itself cuz, what would it even do?
Finally   Another video
7:30 Block Facts’ hair isn’t actual hair, it’s a wig! That’s an awesome Easter egg.
heeyyyyy block fact is backkk

I think anyone who played minecraft before 1.13 came out knows about the fish and that it was replaced with cod! What's crazy is that that update was 4 years ago! Wow!

Return of the king

Bro pls bring back block facts
You are saying that minecraft had a banana and removed it!? How else am I supposed to summon Kevin from Minions the Rise of Gru at 3am?
I actually remember the old fish
Ngl it be a cool feature if the bananas had a feature where if you leave it without eating it it turns too ripe and if you eat it you get nausea
8 minutes ago? Cool I'm early

Ballons is in the game

Mojang won’t add vertical slabs but they were going to add banana pickaxes...

The quality of these videos are honestly insane. The amount of time you must have put into recording, editing, and research must be high. And without a team.
