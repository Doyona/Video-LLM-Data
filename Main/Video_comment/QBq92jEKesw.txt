I can feel his sanity slipping every time he gets a korok seed
incredibly bad
12:48 made me stupidly laugh
bro predictid switch two 24:54
I can’t be the only one who realized the bomb flowers are from  windwaker
Purah le smash 😂
Am I the only one who thinks it’s weird that links 6 years older and looks exactly the same?
35:55 Love this
Called Flurry Rush Bullet Time, we all make mistakes. 😂
12:39 why just why
13:25 "yahaha" 🗣🗣🔥🔥
Every line is quoteable in this, it's hilarious! "Did he he just break the master sword?" "I can see this being a problem." Funnier with context, but you get my point.
24:41 yo run that back???
theoretically if link had swung his sword slightly earlier the shard would have hit ganondorfs eye and this would not have happened
2:08 Should've ran right there.... 2:23 Hello Samus how are you 2:34 He angwy
28:45 chat when he says strong thing to fuse with a hoe 😂😂😂
Theirs only one god Jesus father if you call anyone or anything else a god that’s blasphemy
2:14 "phew, that was a close one"
"😯😲 it works" should be the tagline of this game
Btw the name of this game is korok torture simulator
22:15
1 year later: TOTK is beaten in 29 minutes, if even that.
Now this is ,d.
The Yiga clan hates this thumbnail
little zonai char... another korok!!!!
banana stick
Bro knew that you could save your ultra hand builds😂 he had a vision😂 20:19
MOMMY PURA
22:14 SMASH
13:06 bros the biggest meat rider I’ve ever seen
Me: chilling, looking at my phone while I keep this video in the bg Arm: *starts talking* Me, shooting up on my chair: DIMITRI?
The amount of tech smant finds in his first hours is absurd. I've played this game for month and i haven't thought of half the stuff
2:12 “shes legal now!” Is CRAZY
the arm that seals the darkness
22:15 Chat……. YEAAAAAAAAH, THATS MY CHAT!
36:00 American soldiers in Vietnam for the first time
One day… we will see how this game ends
Smant broke kogah mentally and physically after realising he couldnt bteak the car 😂
Crazy how you can deveop a good game when actually given the proper time to do so
39:08 Me when i hit puberty 🤣🤣😂😂
Some said”shes legal”😭
I love going back to this to see the initial reaction to all of TOTK's mechanics.
Bro the most replayed moment was Zeldas Gyatt 💀
I just don’t get how so many go straight to Lookout Landing after Great Sky Island, meanwhile me and my brother separately spent HOURS searching the rest of the map for the Paraglider.   And the game keeps behaving as if we had it already EVERYWHERE, and we just felt so mocked💀
The sing shield allows you to shield surf jump higher
He said orb of light and a little caesars ad popped up with PERFECT TIMING
Laughing so hard at the first korok getting yeeted
great video
7:39 *vine boom*
The Legendary Comma! That was great.
For me, the blue bunnies are to tell the player a shrine is nearby, especially for caves
20:35 "Hes her ex? They dated??" BRO IS HER GRANDFATHER
i feel so bad cause it we nt 900 to 1000
2:02 “it’s the legendary com” AD BREAK
The game was impressive but playing it makes you really remember how perfect botw is because even with how modern and impressive TOTK is it just simply doesn't stack up to breath of the wild
I love watching SmallAnt play something blind, as opposed to knowing every single thing about a game like he usually does. He should have a thing where he plays games blind every month or something.
How did Bo know about autobuild before he even knew it existed
Crazy how this game is already 1 year old.
Crusty Gannon Darf in the basment
Guys today this game has become a year old
1 year later, one of my favorite things about this game is that every streamer independently came up with the idea to torture koroks. They weren’t copying each other, everyone came up with it on day one before learning everyone else was doing it too.   Like how every country invented beer before learning that every other country also invented beer.
My cat stepped on the like button. He likes your content. You must be satan
22:12, we just gonna ignore the dude who said “finally legal”?
:)
Somehow I have 300 hours in this game and only 10% of what happened to ant happened to me lmao
*Smirks and holds Korok over the edge of the Sky Island*  *Drops Korok*  ...899 more Koroks to go.  This had me in stitches - Pretty sure everybody had the same thought process.
someone  should make a mod for TotK where you can have the shiekah bombs and you can whistle sprint
I put in 120 hours into this game, got all shrines and Koroks, yet never saw a Frox or got the Auto-build. might need to pick the game up again and explore the depths a lot more
20:08 he predicted autobuild?? yo what the heck
you can not do a windbomb
Why does he look so flabbergasted 7:34 😂
Minecraft story mode season 2 Special Bluey green arm?
Rauru is our right hand man
36:57 That was almost perfection
I started laughing because some one in chat at 4:20 said we dropping tilted towers
hey its hestu
Ahh…………… oh there’s no voice acting
Your ability to guess where koroks are is amazing I i havent even beat BOTW so you seem like the best player ive seen.
5:09 beat him with his own stick😂
"It's the legendary comma" 💀
Bro when he said "the ability to rise"😩
22:07 she's not a baby  she's a babe
I played thru the whole game and didnt know you could rail grind until now?
The strangest part about TotK is that Link suddenly becomes right-handed.
You sound so amused to find koroks after what happened in botw
20:19 what did Zarek say?
We still waiting for that 100% totk video!
5:25 I loved the moment where ppl in the chat were saying nice pp (it stands for Purah Pad but it's still funny)
Dye shop
"i think i saw something like this on another website" we know what you watched...
40:32 that looks a lot like lake hylia in OOT with the pillars in the water
35:58 if you go frame by frame the clock hits 4:44.44 and smallant makes a funny face
Hxbdxhdchxjhxb -smallant
Link really woke up and heard "your finally awake"
bro said stanima
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND? 18:42  😎
“I mean you’re kinda just under the castle” if only
24:39 smant what the fuck💀
Oh no it's the king of suave
hestu had a bad hair day😂
Chat: WHERE IS OUR 20 SUBS. Smant: ok my paypal works.
Zelda zesty
You could hear the pain in his voice when he realized that he would have to map all of the depths and how long it would take😂😂😂
that ball peen raft went hitler mode
Bro rlly found autobuild without the quest
Why they do yunobo like that, they made his village suffer through a horrible drug epidemic
I actually didn’t know you could simply grind the rails with the sheild lol
Raru The source of the right arm I guess you could call him my right hand man
Princess Zelda’s sprized Nintendo switch,btw it has special features on it
35:37 he said they renamed the moblin club into a sturdy thick stick meanwhile that's a boko bat
"The more I play this game the more I hate Pokemon Scarlet/Violet"  Based beyond outer space
This game would be better if you weren't forced to play as Link. The most boring and annoying character ever.
great stream
The fact that he got auto build only 4 hours in is unbelievable! I have spent 70 hours on main story and side quests just to find out were autobuild was...
26:23 same. I like sv but totk beats it to a pulp
"THE LEGENDARY COMMA",  godamit that got me laugh so hard!
This man achieved what normal people couldn’t figure out in weeks of playing in one hour. I DIDN’T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT 14:29
36:25  Stanima
"Do I have to break his vehicle? No. I have to break him" -Smallant 2023
"phew that was a close one" describes every zelda storyline ever
No not the korok😂
can you do a wacco boomo
I never figured out you could shield grind like that; gonna try it now
Apparatus glitch is canon, Link has 30 hearts and a full stamina wheel
I know im late but I started rewatching Small ant vids and I personally think the fact that he said 899 koroks to go was very good since there are 1000 koroks in tears of the kingdom
No, the wiggling is gone😭🥺
1:06 take that out of context 💀
when will u upload the new botw 2 vod
4 months later and now TOTK lockout??
3:00 the arm that seals the darkness, the master arm!
"screw Boomie Zoomies, we've got Bumpie Jumpies" Had me rolling
"No I have to break him"- Smallant, 2023
I adore how they did Kohga in this game. He was already the only person do use your magnesis power, now he's the main one to use your building power.
Raru. Everybodys favourite right hand man.
I remember diving into the chasm for the first time, I had seen zero trailers and knew nothing about the game beside the basics, like merging, vehicles and the whole sky area. Though from what I can tell, the trailers didn’t show the depths. Anywho, I thought that chasm was just leading to a cave, then I got the light root and realised “Oh god, this is an entire map, huh?”
That Hank Hill moment when he got attacked by a tree lol
This guy was 5 hours into the game and already started the quest I forgot about and just did after beating the game after approximately 250h KEKW
"It's my right hand man!"  I see what you did there :P
15:40 idk why but the poor bubbul frog laying their with its leg twitching while he admires bomb flowers is sending me
In botw wiiu they patcht manny glitches this year but not wisle sprintin
Thank you for sharing <3
You can get 16 batteries pole batteries and they stack and with zone like chargers you can use them in mid air to help your charging or battery
I have all The shrines and temples and I have defeated a dragon before
19:40 Neuron activation
I crucified a korok and invented korok church 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
can you try beating tears of the kingdom with only meat weapons
36:19 stanima
1:04 Smant getting a perfect down angle of Zelda's butt only to be looking at her Nintendo Switch instead lmao 7:35 I'm calling Rauru my right-hand man now. 17:06 BUMPY JUMPIES FOR THE WIN 23:16 Oh god Smant's obsession with Koroks is going to be the end of him. 25:33 THEY ACTUALLY ADDED AN UNDERGROUND CAVE SYSTEM TOO LET'S GOOO 26:17 "So this game is... BIG big, then." Could've have said it better myself. 36:38 The best part is immediately in the next cut in chat you can sees schleep go "HUH".
IT'S HERE!!! Gonna be binging everyone's first reactions to this game cus this is like, the game of the decade. So excited!!!
36:01  it’s the trees from RuneScape
Legend of Zelda: The legendary comma
nobody is talking about how early he got to kohga... it took like 50 hours before i had the idea to go to the central mine
The autobuild ability was for the end of the game
I’m so excited to see the speedrun strats
Just completed the story, and very excited to be finally able to watch your playthroughs without fearing spoilers hahaha. (And very glad I did. Damn I loved the story!)
Hyrule just can't catch a break lol.
I missed this fire content
Lol, it literally took me 50 hours to find the abandoned central mine, and he does it in less than 4 xD
Hear me Out ok. I have a theory that the Guy in Hateno Village IS kohga i mean,Hes fat and has a similar voice to the yiga footsoldier
How did you know straight away the ability to fuse a board to a shield to create a skateboard? Seemed like you knew how to do that already…
how did this guy figure out more features in this game in 2 hours than I did in 40
I do love that it wasn't even Link and Zelda's fault that the seal was broken.  It just happened to run out right when they got there.
Smart freaking out about a peblit is the funniest thing I’ve seen today
Look guys, I like Purah as much as the next guy but are you really into that older women thing? If so, geez.
You skipped past a lot of the story at the beginning
I went into the shrine of resurrection but didn't do anything else on there so I missed the statue you descovered  Edit: I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE YIGA THING WTF? I got all the yiga armor but not that one!!  Edit 2: wait a minute I DID do the gate water thing, I just didn't do that quest lol
Getting the yiga outfit was my greatest joy, what a fun storyline!!
Lol he found the great abandoned mine before even talking to josha!
Din't know you could shoot the frox in the eye, makes so much sense.  When I ran out of bombs i just shot other stuff in his mouth which kept him cheewing for long enough that I could get some Hits in.
YOU CAN BUMPIE JUMPIE I HAD NO CLUE!.
I never watched any of the gameplay so fuse was a TOTAL surprise to me, such a cool ability!
YOU CAN RAILGRIND????
Yknow what? I've beaten hyrule castle, I'm not done with the game but I think I've done enough to where this video can't spoil me on anything...
I'm really happy I'm not the only one who struggled to figure out which way the fans blow
I love this new building system because I found it hard to get around in both. I would always climb cliffs and paraglide off them
I played 10 hours of the game, found it tedious, boring, and really frustrating to get around, and while I still do, your video has inspired me to give the same another shot at some point.
Sekiro looking a lot different
I fell asleep watching one of your other vids and when I woke up I heard “wait why is he in his underwear “
Zelda become the lorax
ive been watching ur vids for 3 years yet i only just realized how much i love his laugh
"899 koroks to go." That actually killed me XD
“It’s the legendary comma” Words of a true chad 🗿🍷
Who else has to die before Princess Zelda becomes Queen Zelda? lol
My dad won the first day
12:55 NO HOW COULD YOU 😂
for some reason i get the impression that smant likes this game
do you have an addiction to koroks??
I did not know that you can just rail grind I thought you had to have a mine cart attached or smth I feel stupid
Lol when Purah was revealed someone in chat said "Recall her to make her a baby again"
I got the Korok by gluing him to the side of the Minecart.
this dude diving headfirst into the depths within 5 hours of starting the game is making me feel insane because i didnt get to the central mine until at least hr 25
Finally, after one month and like 200 hours in the game, Im finally able to watch these videos
12:57 Why did my balls actually start hurting!?
finally link looks old enough to drink
x)  The speedrunner's mindset. "Very well. There will be no more wiggling. There will be new glitches to find." xD
This was very entertaining 🤣 all of your reactions were genuine and added to tge enjoyment of this video! I even learned more about the great plateau that I totally missed! Thank you 😊
If I'm lucky this closest weekend this will be the last totk video I watch without having it
23:54 be giving Vecna vibes
Bro beat the enemy with his meat💀
I don't think it would be a problem good sir
I'm glad someone found "source of the right arm" as funny as I did! I haven't seen anyone else comment on it lol
Zombie Ganon: Is that the sword that seals the darkness!?!?!?  The Game two minutes later: "Master Sword: The sword that seals the darkness."   😂😂😂
Funny how literally the first thing ant does is go fight Kohga without starting the quest at all lmfao
Kudos on that Frox fight with practically no items and a very limited arsenal.
It took me like 60 hours to meander my way around the world and find auto build.
38:57 LMAO
I’ve beaten the game and now I just realize you can shield surf the rails
Source of the right arm Rauru looks different from ocirena of time Rauru
Bumpie wumpies 😭I’m using that. Also rauru as “the source of the right arm” is FICKING wmwziny
Lol
The perfect little boat
Gotta love the underground moment. I got there through another path and didn't find a lightroot for a while. I was just in awe the entire time.
“Rauru, source of the right arm.”  Imagine the only accomplishment you have left that you’re remembered for is that you had a right arm.
Backpack koroks
I find it funny how you can stick a koroks face to a ultrahand material😂
Imagine not trying to die to the keese and succeeding:)
You're so right about scarlet and violet. This game clearly shows that they have could done a MUCH better job and basically eradicating all the annoying flaws. it's clearly not a console issue.
10:10
899 more koroks to go
13:47 bro have the time Stone
i want to see link's PP              it's a shorcut for Purah Pad what did you think i meant       btw spell ICUP
,
Man called autobuild
17:39 kidpresident0 fr thinks anyone is gonna listen to them 💀💀let alone read that paragraph-- L bozo moment
When rahro was in the temple someone said smash😂
7:20 this aged very well
I just Realized that Recall is actually some sort of Sage-Oath
Rauru is mega ampharos confirmed?
I walked down rail after the ultra hand shrine before getting ultra hand. Ended up having to walk back up it 😔
finally going back to watch this after sinking over 200 hours into this game (cause i was adamant about avoiding spoilers and have too much free time) is so fucking hilarious i love seeing him mess with shit in ways i only figured out like 40 hours in lmao
the dick ship? seriously?     genius comedy.
It's the same feeling as playing botw for the first time, its magical
“The more I play this game… the more I come to hate scarlet and violet”   Truer words have never been spoken
"My right hand man" damn that's a good one lmao
the first hand ability is just a physics gun from Garry's mod
I tried to push the pull door at hirual castle
You find a mimic POV: 35:53-36:04
39:37 🤨📸
Goty
26:23 I had that same exact reaction at exactly that same lightroot lol
Smallant brain is so superior it can even understand how a fan works 🤣🤣
i am trying to move through the story slow enough that i’m not burning myself out, but fast enough so i can watch smants videos without getting spoilers
The ultra hand ability is the most broken thing to exist in any game ever
you keep killing them koroks!
I love how he calls them Stewart like the mouse
I am about 40 hours in the game and I no idea about the Auto Build ability and the Kouga fight LOL
classic nintendo mark, gotta make sure every player knows what's happening regardless of previous experience.
19:42 NEURON ACTIVATION
I thought the backpack koroks were just really fat for like 2 weeks
No the master sword is female
No balls 🥺
Looks 100x more fun ngl
i thought tears of the kingdom was a very popular mod.
I love how when he sees the arm he's just like ooh
The new towers seem like they work similar to mad max. It’s cool to see a good game that does that kind of stuff
My mom grabbed a hot-footed frog nearly instantly after hitting the water, surprisingly. She is ready to be a totk speedrunner
32:25 THAT IS SO LATEGAME MAN
when the arm started glowing and talking I assumed he was gonna be like fi from skyward sword
4:12 the fact you see that dragon... well done nintendo
his proppeler hat tho
talks about the greatest belly flop human kind has ever seen... have you never heard the name Kaido of the Beasts?
wait, what animated series? EDIT: oh, the original one from the 80s. oof
I retired my copie because I can’t pet dogs
39:14 me fighting people taller than me
Mario Odyssey 2 is coming soon
23:50 oh shit she going into creative mode then spectator mode
I love how this game showcases the epic battle between the legendary comma and the grammar police
comma's of the kingdom
All the vegans fear my meat stick
Bro killed a frox but ran from a walking tree
You should do a Pokémon Speed Race but you and your competitor get to secretly replace Trainer/Gym Leaders Pokémon on each other’s runs to try to mess each other up.  (Or up the pokemon’s levels by a set amount)
I've finally beaten the game and explored enough to where there's a near 0 chance of spoilers, so here I am.
“Bananas” - Kevin Spacey
I love how he just accidentally found the Great Abandoned Central Mine yet it took me hours because I was following the wrong statues.
"Hey! Is that Hestu?.....THAT IS NOT HESTU"
1,000 korok seeds to find
Rauru did not need to be that hot.
skyrim reference 3:24
I beat ganon but still frox is a nightmare to me
I really do feel that comment about how bad this game makes Scarlet/Violet look, but it's really more than that. Practically ANY open world game and/or RPG makes Scarlet/Violet look horrible in comparison. And what's worse is that there are people who will try to claim that Scarlet/Violet is the best game in the series. In fact, it's the opposite. Scarlet/Violet is far and away the worst game in the series.  Let's ignore the technical problems and how gross the game looks in general (the latter of which isn't even a Switch issue; there are plenty of good looking games on Switch, but SV looks like a goddamn D Tier PS2 game), the actual design is borderline nonexistent. Just consider a other open world games. Not their technical specs, just the world design. Elden Ring, BotW/TotK, Forbidden West... practically every open world you compare to SV's makes the difference apparent. Outside of the normal Catch/Battle primary gameplay loop, SV's world offers nothing. It's as if they simply knocked the walls down between each route and called it a day. Hell, how can an open world game have barely any side quests? How is that possibly? Especially since they just released Arceus, which has like 50 side quests!  And if anything, features have been stripped out of the game. For instance, character customization is severely limited compared to the past few games, and the Battle Tower was removed. Now, I'm not married to the Battle Tower or anything, but you can't remove the only token piece of post-game that your game has and replace it with nothing.  SV is an abject train wreck, and I cannot fathom how people are defending this. RSE on the GBA had more content and more gameplay variety than SV does for fuck's sake!
23:08 that joke left me in tears 😂
2:15 Time for SUAVEMENTE!
I wonder if Smant will try speedrunning this one when once some routes/tech gets discovered.
go give hestu a hug
I gave this video a like when Smant said, "hey it's my right hand man"
My guy that is not a comma it is a tear
21:55
Chasm discovered "Alright chat we will jump in there in a sec"   -Smallant and a mentaly well person 2023
Can we have an entire video of ur full play through
It took about 3 hours for you to find something I haven't seen in many more hours.
i put off watching this for fear of spoilers. I just finished the 4 regional phenomenon quests so i thought it was safe but i haven't even seen the yiga yet and haven't done much in the great plateau lmao it is kind of hilarious how free-form your progression can be
As a first time watching Smallant, I just wanna say that it is amazing and the hat fits him perfectly
I FUSED A MINE CART TO MY SHIELD NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The “legendary coma” oh my gosh lol.
smallant is the first youtuber who's reaction has actually been relatable, testing the stamina, shooting the keese with sword beam, even the mentioning of theories when they examined the zonai EVEN THE ICKY ARM BRO WERE IN SYNC. AND TESTING THE FLURRY RUSH AND GETTING HIT THE FIRST TIME THEN PCIKING UP THE STICK AND JUST KILLING HIM
I actually love the perspective smallant takes, every single thing he thought in the opening sequence I had thought the exact same stuff when i first played
Speed runs ideas in comments mine is  meat stick run it is any% but u Speedrun the meat stick
I wandered off course and died so many times before finally making it to Lookout Landing and getting the paraglider. There were a few times I got stuck on a sky island with no way down and had to load from an earlier save.  For some reason, I got it in my head that I needed to get to Hateno Village to get a paraglider, but that was just to change the fabric once you already have it.
Chat when they see Purah: “Would”
Look at link at 17:09
NGL, when I got fuse, i made a stick stick
13:30 How you go from "Oh this so fun, look at this wacky enemy with his fan" to John Wick style kill everyone is amazing lol
Everyone's experience so far: utterly amazed, slightly grossed out by sexualization stuff, utterly amazed
Smant's "where are you" at 3:15 sounds so much like an in-game voiceline. I was tabbed out and when he said that I was like "what? i don't remember that being a voiceline?"
Fun detail that you start the game with 15 hearts per line, 30 max like the cap in botw, despite the fact that in totk has 20 per line and 40 is the cap
My headcannon for why there are no more Sheikah shrines is because once they served their purpose Zelda and company decided to dismantle them for parts. Same goes for the Guardians.
Same thing happened to me on the temple of time! But instead this time, I hadn’t saved for so long and my glider fell, I had to brainstorm an idea how to get down.
where did you get that proppeler hat
Did he ever get the ancient snow pants?
Can we all take a moment to pay respects to kidpresident0's legs... Get a fan my friend.17:39
Any future would-be villain of Hyrule should really learn not to fuck Link up and put him into a coma, he always comes back stronger and with new powers
34:50
Im waaaay better then smallant at this game. I beat it in a 3rd of the time he did, and died 1 time all the way through to 100% at 59 hours 48 minutes 20 seconds. :)
funny how ant instantly denies looking at zeldas butt
2:57 this shit had me crying laughing bro
I have literally beaten the entire game and just learned from this video that you can ride the rails on a shield
Is my arm gonna Touch me again? 😂😂
He called autobuild
I feel personally attacked with that diamond shape joke
HOW, How did you managed to end up in the Central mine? I was trying so hard to find it
How did you know you were sending the sword back in time just from that cutscene
damn, he even predict the auto build mechanic
Stanima?
Smant's being so single-minded about the Koroks is both hilarious and incredibly relatable
LITERALLY EVERYONE TRIES TO KILL THE KOROK  BUT NONE SUCCEED  SOME WOULD SAY THE KOROK IS UNDYING  BUT IS SAY YOUR SPIRIT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH
you want to know how I got rid of the yiga in the shrine of resurrection?            i toasted their banana so they stopped giving a shit.
"I think I saw something like this on another website," when Link gets groped by the metal arms had me dead
I can't believe someone completed their first shrine using shield surfing. Amazing
“Do I have to break his vehicle? No I have to break him”
you should strap a Korok to some rockets and propel it into the stratosphere
Just a there’s a minimum age at which you‘re allowed to say "smash", there should be a maximum age too. Four times as old as you seems to fit the bill, chat.
bro predicted autobuild 20:08
I hate how true it is when he says that the more he plays this game the more he hates scarlet and violet. Like the messed that one up BAD
just realized that the english zelda voice sucks (im french)
not gonna lie. I hate when you do the "youtuber" voice. I wish you would stop but I understand you gotta pull in those 10 year old viewers.
Every player meeting a korok the first time I. TOTK. Korok: I need help Link: so you have chosen death
Why did you shave that masculine beard and moustach
I love how "the legendary comma" is the last thing you hear before the first ad break
,
The title should be I played tears of the kingdom… THE GLOOM HANDS HAUNT ME HELP IM SCARED. Better title tbh
zelda appears at 4:13 LOLLLL
The legend of Zelda: Nuts & Bolts.
Optional belly flop would have been so Nintendo.
22:12 10/10 Wood
making whistle sprinting deplete stamina faster was such a middle finger
The first game was Linky Hawk : Pro Hylian. This is Linky Hawk 2 : Under-Depth
1:59 ,
the first thing i checked was the whistle sprinting as well it will take a lot of getting used to
fortnite copy
My nuts hurt when I saw the ships nuts get crushed
8:50 that was fuckin gnarly dude
Smant serving Joey Rooney from Liv and Maddie
You can never unsee goatse shrine, you can only skip the intro and try not to think about it.
Can we talk about the thumbnail? *BANANA SWORD SUPREMACY*
"oh.. so this game is BIG BIG"
You could say rauru is your Right hand man
good
That shield slide was so cool and unexpected lol : nice skill ! That's why botw and totk are such great games.
I didn’t get to the mine so I got the largest spoiler so far, damn you Smant and your great content
YOU CAN GRIND RAILS WITHOUT A MINE-CART SHIELD?!
I had a dream I was in tears of the kingdom and there was blue pillars on like modded great plateau
He predicted autobuild
now use some glitches
I love him not knowing the great abandoned central mine is under the great plateau it litterally says great
i would make out with smallant if he does his deep voice
I love the universal feeling of players entering the depths for the first time, getting the first light root on the map, and realized what was said here: "Oh. Oh this game is BIG big."  Because uhhh YEAH it really is.
You can shoot the glowing blue rabbits for rupees
*MEAT* *STICK*
How do you open the door 4 hearts
I took 8h to get the paraglider😂
When is GetLaid% Purah edition coming out?
I've watch several people play this by now and Ant is the first I've seen rail grind the first shrine. Ingenious really.
"What's the fastest way I can get over there?" Comedic genius, haven't laughed this hard at Zelda content thus far and I'm only like 13 minutes in Liked, Commented (yeah no duh) and Subbed, looking forward to more Tears content from this absolute madlad Also learned about tony hawk-ing being possible thanks to you, big huge props for even trying that, 5000IQ
why zelda games graphics are so washed out? terrible artistic choices, terrible characters and level designs.............
You could play without gettin the paraglider but  youd have no map lmao
I can finally watch these videos after finishing the game.
Raruu or whatever is our real right hand man
Part 2
the way he just exclaims "MEAT STICK!" is hilarious 11:15
17:57 ah yes link’s Famous last Words : how does this work ?
actually screaming at 15:55 because wrd for word, beat for beat, that was my exact reaction
Frey & Cuff is waving
15:00 SmallAnt seeing a fan for the first time in his life, 2023 (colourised)
BOOMY ZOOMIES -> BUMPY JUMPIES
16:49 link has finally aquired the ultimate defense, ERA
13:05 this actually hurt my balls
I hate the controls in this game. It's like they took all the controls of BotW, with all of it's KNOWN problems, then instead of fixing them, they made it worse. The game is so difficult to control and navigate I feel like all the times I am not fighting enemeies, I am fighting the controls. Or all the times I'm not solving puzzles, I'm trying to puzzle out the controls. They need a overhaul of the clunky, unfriendly controls quick. It just makes me so frustrated and I go back to playing BotW.
I love how people are already doing things like putting shields on shields, making giant lethal lollipops, cheesing Boss Bokos, committing war crimes against Koroks, making literal tanks, and overall just breaking the game
1:00 That DOES look upgraded. Well the Switch as well.
Meat stick😏
Bumpy jumpies!!
"899 koroks to go," 😂
The puzzles, the sheilds, the exploration. Watching a streamer who is actually smart enough to understand and try out most things in the first stream is dope. SMARTANT 🐜
"what would have hurt me?" Was exactly my response too 😂
I wish I could just mute Smant but still hear the game 😂
yeah Rauru's the goat
So he is playing on emulator, no frame drop when using ultrahand and in the depths, clearly the way to play
Is it just me or is the “come on…..suck” was the funniest line ever 😂😂😂😂😂😂
MEAT ARROW
36:19 stanima
39:50 That's a really neat way to solve that shrine. I also spent like 20 minutes trying to build steps, until I remembered I could just stack them and use Ascend... Which, in my defense, that's the most situational ability, so it's the easiest to forget like Cryonis in BOTW.
Ngl... that "right hand man" joke got a good laugh outta me xD
Who tf are you and why is my YT  givin me a notification? 🤔😂
Would LOVE an unedited VOD
31:43 man creates a combine harvester to plow the field at night.
Bro just discovered so much. I didn't know you could do half of the things he did
30:33, Accidentally finds Auto-build by wandering through the Depths before even getting the relevant quest lol.
“Hey, it’s my right hand man!”  *long silence*
pog count 50% through the video: 3
I couldn't figure out that I was supposed to drain the water lol I was looking all around the lake trying to ultrahand stuff out of the water, then I went into the hole nearby thinking that "under the water" must mean in the depths... I spent like an hour trying to figure out wtf to do before I eventually just googled it and then I felt really dumb lmao
I almost hate watching you because of how fucking smart you are when it comes to utilizing game mechanics. I literally never would have thought about shield surfing with a minecart so I could slide down the tracks.
8:38 THPS let’s go!!!
big dng
Hi
i really want to see this... but if i will play blind when tears of the kingdom finally arrives this saturday, i have to be strong....
“Hey, look, it,s my right hand man!”
"she almost got cooties dude"
Link has W rizz
no boys were bounced
I originally thought that Rauru's voice actor was Matthew Mercer. I proceeded to look it up, found out Mercer voiced Ganon, got scared, found out it was Chris Hackney, felt relieved.
This is literally the opening plot of Princess Mononoke. Same wormie animation and disfigured right arm too
Hello
I have over 100 hours on BOTW and this game seems way bigger. I can see myself easily getting 150-200+ hours here.
“Do I have to break his vehicle? No. I have to break him”
MASTER KOHGA RETURNS!!!!
I love how the korok concept turned it into a tree.
I beat the 4 dungeons and got the mastersword and only just found out you could rail grind.
Smant be needing his stanima
First death at 13:36
22:16 I thought I was the only one
its more like WHEN are you :)
Anyone else realize that they told us the master sword would be broken when they revealed the logo?
I introduce autobuilder
Hold R, then select an item with dpad up. Much better than using an arrow.
Smant experiences occaisonal korok madness
I feel like you are actually faster in totk. Like botw speed up 1 fast.  I 100% know that the flurry rushes are faster though.
Broth that arm got those nasty nails
Hey does he use emulator on computer or an actual switch
I'm so mad. I struggled so long to get up that mountain in the bumpy jumpy part because I was dumb. So I ran all the way to the end only to find a Korok, I tried to built a tree bridge, I cried for 10 minutes and then I found the correct way up like 10 Meters from where I built the bridge. And you just try the first stupid thing and it works... Lost 30 minutes of my time and at least 2 years of my life because of that part.
The shrines look like rocks
You just know a bunch of speed runners are looking on how to skip thad debuf
I just got this game today. It is AWESOME!!!
Zelda still got that cake though 😋
Blupees were a main source of rupees in BotW and speed runners don't know what the glowing rabbits are. 😂😭
Purah enters and the first thing in chat I see is “SHES LEGAL”
I had to 1000% switch to japanese in the first 10 seconds
the legendary comma 💀
Rauru, the arms dealer
funny this still looks the same as BOTW and STILL looks better than pokemon
Cant wait till he goes to the great plateau and finds the big boko boi
The medieval village of Chillingbourne would have made a better backdrop.
10:10  Cool, Cool Mountain
darkest dungeon nuzloce
rt game made it to the bottom of hyrule castle and discovered and this technically isnt a spoiler as im not saying what its about but the very very bottom of hyrule castle is the final boss
Nice vod!  One question: From what you've experienced thus far, how buggy has the game been? I want to know if I should get it soon or wait until things have patched up.
J
i just got the game and it is so fun
Just buy it, folks. It's an instant classic. Have played every zelda game ever, and this one is just botw on creative-steroids.
Is it just me but when the arm speaks to link in the beginning it sounds like the opening of Skyrim?
Can't wait for him to throw a ruby/sapphire/topaz/opal at an enemy & get blasted by his own elemental explosion.
26:23  this.
Oh god, Ant DOESN‘T know those swallowing flowers??  That was just pure slapstick. 😂
I've played a bit now, and I don't know if I'll ever load BOTW again lol. I haven't even got to the third ability yet, lol. Btw nice hat, dude.
Descending into the depths of hell for the first time was terrifying
I personally think this game is very bad and should deleted by Nintendo
I checked whistle sprinting as well
When I first found the Hyrule Field Chasm, it was before I got the paraglider, and so I just used a wing capsule and roughly glided it down there. It took a few tries, but overall it isn’t a hard skip for pre-paraglider.
16:27 (timestamp)
19:17 A new symbol has appeared on the Monado!
39:09
23:09 man this is kingdom
Everyones Expectation: 10/10 Totk Opening Scene: Why stop at 10? How about 20/10? Everyone: .... excuse me what?
"suck" likelike: "no u"
Zonai just look like the zeffo from fallen order, oh no
Smants reaction to everything "can I kill it?"
i liked the "right hand man" joke.
Revali’s Gale 2.0:  Revali got sick of Link’s shit and resorted to grenades   (referencing the shield bomb jump)
fuse the master sword with a apple
Dude that shield bomb trick is so awesome I just used it in a shrine that I couldn't figure out
21:10 They used freewill mechanics from skyward sword?
IS THAT AN AMBER RELIC?
39:09 "me when I when I when when if when" -Ant, Small 2023
The sheka switch
I just truly wish they had never introduced voice acting, is all.
My favorite addition has to be throwing items. Makes chu jelly, fruits, and bombs so nice to use
zelda turned into max from stranger things for a hot sec
Tanner just shield surfing everywhere is the best example I have ever seen of "multiple solutions to the same problem"
On trending less gooo
I have this on my queue to watch when I get farther into my own play through, but I wanted to stop in to say I’m highly looking forward to watching all the streamers play this game. It’s so incredibly good.
Genuinely before i even left the first place i also tried whistle sprinting. Honestly i think its almost balanced becuase it increases your noise so much that all nearby enemies are all drawn to you, and doesnt work for climbing or swimming.  But yeah i felt like the map was a bit smaller than BotW, except actually theres 3 maps now so thats excusable, and thats even if they did actually shrink everything becuase i could just be misremembering.
they have bomb flowers from the old games
I found out that when the rocks fall from the sky u can jump on them and rewind them to go really high for movement
Its crazy how different his first couple of hours on this game went compared to mine. God I'm sooo happy with this game
My t count is substantially lower from watching this.
25:36 POV: lana rhoades bebe
Purah smash
That "Raft" at 12:34 just killed me.. especially  when it was "Fixed" a little bit later... I had to pause the video because I was laughing so hard I couldn't see. Thankyou @SmallAnt for the laughs, it really brightened my day.
You’re welcome for makin it to the end :)
Who remembers when smallant made a diamond sword in an old zelda video he completely predicted fuse
Part 2 wen?
🐨
25:20 do you know where this shape goes?... thats right.. you put it in the square hole
I'm still not very far into the game but I'm absolutely loving it. One thing I have definitely noticed is it looks like Nintendo saw the speedruns and specifically tried to patch all the ways that those runs were breaking the game. RIP Stasis launching, whistlesprinting and windbombing  List goes on, skipping cutscenes into shrines? BLSS
15:55 😂😂😂😂😂😂
oh hey purah is now using the Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity look
meat aroww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is probably the most well made mod of Breath of the Wild I have ever seen.
how quickley did he make this video? and it is still high quality as always! this man is a mad man... keep up with the good work!
BTw you can have all the horses tamed from BOTW transferred to TOTK! no lies its the truth..
1:07 we all saw that lmao
I played for 6 hours and didn't know about the depths
19:47 anti-vegan arrow  😂
I thought it was funny when purah came on screen and ants eyes said ohh no shes hot
27:00 I spent a few hours in the depths how did I never run into that thing?! I saw plenty of little ones but not that big boy! 😭😂
I like how whenever smant plays Breath of the Wild, he is all serious and calm. But when he plays Tears of the Kingdom, he acts like a kid on christmas.
ive put over 10 hrs into this game and im just now finding out you can rail grind and skateboard LOL
Smash
“The legendary comma” absolutely sent me my guy
15:45 look at his face 😂
So who *did* you raid
purah…. would
is that the fabled oxford comma
you gotta play hide and seek in this game.
I want to watch the full stream on VODS Chanel.
Dude all my weapons were 40 dmg min before I went in the depths cause I thought it was end game stuff
I love how the first thing he checked was whistle sprint😭I mean I did too but still
Looks kinda like a BotW add-on.
(:
Ive cheesed like 12 shrines just "magnesising" something upwards and dropping it then standing on it and rewinding up IT WORKS SO MUCH
I know its a long game but the Cuts where to tight it kind of destroyes the video of the game.
I hate that when he said “woah it’s upgraded” I did not realise he was looking at the sheikah slate. Edit: thank you chat for having my back 2 seconds later
am i the only one who’s disappointed at how similar the base game/story design is to botw?
I LOVE tears of the kingdom I got it yesterday its too good not to play every day even when your dead
yay
7:49 i couldnt stop laughing
hey smallant, how do you immediately start spinning in super mario odyssey
Purah is older!!!
“FINALLY, your awake.” Sounds familiar
Watching this made me realize how stupid and uncreative I was while playing the beginning part of the game
NUMBER 12 ON TRENDING
Someone already beat the game in 94 minutes…
2:40 "I could see this being a problem" XD
I guess you could say Rauru is an arms dealer
Wait how can he have the Zonai Glider thing on his back?
Yo the combos he thinks of is crazy
Is he going to make a new video for every stream? Because I would really appreciate that.
9:23 Sonic Frontiers at home
I got this game a day early and I can say its AMAZING. (also whistle running getting patched still hurts lol)
Kohga is building the killdozer
28:34 deez nuts
Scarlet and Violet are still great games, it's not really the best comparison to this game when BOTW and TOTK have done what no other Switch game has done. If anything, it proves Nintendo needs to outsource their in-house devs when they can to help out the studios under their wing. (Like for Legends Arceus, supposedly a B-team from Monolith Soft helped with the open world aspects.)
Why does Rauru sound like Dimitri from FE3H?
Welcome to Breath of the Wild X Skyward Sword
What HDMI adapter do you use to record? It looks like you have no input lag!
Is it just me or who saw hands lifting up the castle
how is this top 15 on trending lmao
why is purah so hot lol
Cant wait for IGN     7/10 too much air.
YOU CAN SHELD SURF RAILS??A I just walked lmao
My friend fused with my hoe a and they did a lot of damage😢😂
First 2 minitues i had exact same reactions lol
Woooo
Cap
its 1000 koroks now since 100 of them are the bring me to my friend
in summary, link and zelda go into a cave and find radagon with a Nintendo switch, then he like eats link like in that one anime. then he arm is like blue.
Raura: The Arms Dealer
The thing about Link's first dive is if you don't accelerate you can time it so that the music cuts out as he hits the water. surely!
This game is so pretty 😭
Smant I just came to comment I'll have to watch this later because I need to experience this myself first just the first minute is hype.
Fusing a glider to your shield lets you shield jump higher, you can get bullet time anywhere with the added height
Ok,my theory was correct,TOTK is based on zonai tech
Ayo what the fuck happened to that giant ass arena... under the castle
Im 90% sure the act of walking on that platform the vibrations is what finally kicked the arm over all theses years.
This game actually looks so fun omg!
No more boomyzoomy :(
Man koga really held a grudge for 6 years
Will the vods for the playthrough be uploaded? or should i watch them on twitch before they disappear? I wanted to Watch the full playthrough in chunks when i have time
I'm not terribly far in but I had pretty similar reactions to tanner when seeing things for the first time. Like the opening drop scene his face of realizing just how big this game is gonna be I felt the same
I havent watched the video cause i want to experience the game myself however I will drop a like soley cause I thought the video said "Its Terrible" and I was about to watch with a fury
it would be so cool if the reason link couldn't catch zelda was because his arm was weak not because he was a little slow
I do wish Link and Zelda would kiss already because I am so tired of debating it with people. We’re basically arguing about the sky being blue. 😂
POV you fuse the bow of light and master sword
What if there’s a new way to kinda Windbomb with the bomb arrows
Something me and smant found funny is the fact that Rauru's title is the source of the right arm
First it was a switch and now grinding rails!?💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
wait so kohga is just every team star boss fight from scarlet and violet then?
I can’t believe they made Purah a M.I.L.F.
I comment to help statistics
So I play Botw but never finished it would I have to go back and play that b4 I play TotK?
12:59 bro got the new hitler boat 😭
I played TotK yesterday too!
Bro is gonna get banned
I Wonder what would happen if link would jerk off with his right arm
Glad to see we both killed the keese with the master sword beam
I dont think thats TotK, that looks more like the anime "parasyte"
7th trending less goooooooooooo
it was funny how much speedrunners struggled having to adjust to just walking and gliding instead of being able to instantly propel yourself across the map and run infinitely
bro literally i thought this looked like skyward sword
You had someone make a great mod, can’t wait for TotK to come out.
That was so good I am CRYING 7:40
legend of zelda but steampunk it seems
Tutorial island is cool and all but honestly im still bummed about how much of this game is just "do it again" from last game. Calamity is now gloom woo, too many reused enemies, mechanics ect for a game thats strong point is exploration. We suffered enough shrines and seeds didnt we? Still having fun anyway.
14:35 YOOOOOOO
Plz continue this on youtube
Funny to see we went on completely a different route ! I went for the hebra region first as it is my favourite haha
i watched this guy for hte first time and i instantly wanted to watch more lol
0:12 too bubbyt I’m an Aussie and Australia’s good
Tears is crazy, it's like 100x better than Breath of the Bland Physics Lesson.  All that wonderful Zelda lore & plot finally returns after a 10 Year absence!! 💫
69959
sd
game is massive.  botw provided content for years,  this is going to be great
I'm just repeatedly watching this over and over until my copy arrives tomorrow. Send help
i tried preventing myself from watching totk before playing it.. it was too difficult
.... DID NINTENDO JUST "HEY YOU YOURE FINALLY AWAKE" US?
Alternate title: SmallAnt struggles with fans.
Rauru really told him to get 50 million power
Link walks up naked* Ayo who stole my clothes?
what the fuck is the depths
I must say, the scene where Link got infested with the arm reminds me so much of beginning from the anime movie Princess Mononoke ❤
Such a great game i can't wait to finish it
3:23 You were caught trying to explore the caverns, same as me
…one down-  10:10
Calling Lauru "the source of the right arm" is so funny to me
10:11 the new version of the Penguin Incident in SM64
still sad I can't put a fish on things
With all the Divine Beasts, Shrines, Towers, Champion's Ballad Shrines, and now the Depths, JUST HOW MUCH STUFF IS HIDDEN UNDER HYRULE?!
Link’s little nerdy-ass laugh whenever he fuses something will never get old
Omg is rauru the swordsman from twilight princess??? Or is it link from a past life?
all I could think about while playing this was "new fortnite map looking epic"
Omg the shield cart
Man the graphics are so bad. Somehow looks worse than botw imo
the arm that seals the darkness
looks the same tbh
,
Can't believe Dimitri also lost an arm now
the fuse mech is so cool
Just 39:35
Is it just me or does the TOTK cartridge taste funny?
Guys can i tell you something depressing. My uncle got the game and is probably going to give it to me for my b day which is in this month. I have got exams literally in like 2 or 3 weeks so the only time i can start playing it is after week 3 of june. On the plus side i got the game.
Bro, there are going to be absolute THOUSANDS of videos of people building Korok torture devices.  I am floored. TotK is going to be a hell of a content fountain.
10:13 MADE ME LOSE IT  899 koroks to go...
Smant is killin it with the comedy here
She got the new iPhone
The bomb jump blew my mind, that was so cool
do i have to break his vehicle? no i have to break him where is he had be laughing omfg
That one dude in chat when Rauru gets introduced  "Ruh roh"
The legendary comma
It's so fun watching you enjoy this so much
Okay so it’s not just me, combat is a *lot* harder in this one
the way I'm watching this is I'm pausing every time smant catches up to me, then I'll play the game a bit and then watch again until he catches up again and so on and so forth
Master Kohga, still as hammy as ever
you should go for the shrine near lurelin, its tough and fun
Bro, Purah…
Right when Purah got on screen chat knew what to do.
What happened to links clothes. They just disappeared
35:57 🤣 when the tree came alive someone on stream said “Trevenant” 🤣🤣🤣 I cried
Purah 🥵
Please do more gameplay videos of TOTK!
I fucking hate that I'm legit laughing out loud at this.. lol
26:56 it's glutko
One could say that giant abyssal frog got FROXed up! XD
Just here to see if I want the game fr
Alright, sick rail grind has really propelled this high on my ranking, this is good.
Cool. They remade Botw
When he said it looks upgraded at 1:07 I really thought he meant Zelda's butt lmao.
I’m 50/50 on buying it. Can someone help me make up my mind?
Pls keep doing this for the game
yiga base is def a cave
40:48 correct me if I’m wrong, but those look like they’re close to where the original shrines once were
I love how there is just an immediate Skyrim reference...
This is gonna be a long video wherever he catches up to where I am and I wait a day to watch agaib
trying to avoid spoilers but im curious and click on the video skip ahead a bit to 24:41 and instantly left the video
Bro I didn't follow the mission and I was just running around for like 2 hours 💀
"It's my right hand man" That made me audibly groan.
12:57 no children
Nintendo: Sees people sticking minecarts together for flying in BoTW..  "This is what the people want."
oh no, Link got Ashitaka'd.
I wanted to wait to play this but I may just hop in
There is a save feature for the ultrahand, but you have to go deep below a familiar place
smash
“it’s the legendary comma”
is he going on twitch today or tomorrow?
Genuine question, do we think BOTW will be the better game to speedrun?
I like how there’s several ways to Fly. Cannons, Paraglider, Fast Travel, Ect.
The "Right Hand Man" comment had no business being that funny💀
Speedrun it now
Zelda is a dragon in this game and ganondorf final from can furry rush
Playing the shit outta this game once my finals are over
Ah this explains why he did beat Breath of the Wild in a single day. Got to leave this one and watch that one first for sure. Then come back to this amazing video🔥
#6 on trending what? ;)
The deadpan look with “899 koroks to go” had me dying laughing.
The sheer amazement at grinding the rail was shared with probably everyone at that moment
This game is making me tear up from how good it is
It's great, the content attracts viewers
bro the tool in this game is going to make speed running insane, there will defiantly be some weird weapon merge or built that just super over powered and beats everything
Clearly a tear      SmallAnt: “The Legendary Comma!”💀
Can't wait for people to find a way to bug out the initial scene to start off with 30 health and max stamina💀
this video is gonna get you banned
If I had a nickle for every time the blue ghost of an old man told me to go to several shrines marked on a map in the opening area after awakening in a strange room to a mysterious voice saying "Link, you're finally awake" only to be greeted by a strange humanoid figure gifting me a glowing magic orb after saying "you have done well to make it this far" when I had completed said shrine.  I would have 2 nickles.
was there a time skip in the beginning? how long did link heal up for?
Legend of Zelda nuts and bolts
I like the insane amount of people yelling that this is a mod and not the real totk
Yeah I’m just gonna stick to BOTW
Anybody play on the original switch? Hows the performance that's the only reason I'm holding off on my purchase so far
The moment when he made the minecart shield is when I realized how many possibilities there are and how much I need to get this game.
seeing ant become so lifeless every time he sees a korok is so funny to me
Smant: Shield rides across , Bomb Jumps up Me: I got tree, I  put tree on other tree
I also thought it would be orb of light. Quite funny that we had the same thought.
3:24 nah I didn't know this was a Skyrim sequel 💀
It would be funny if they added bellyflops as a feature and you just die if you do it from too high
nice video
Tomorrow I'm getting tears of the Kingdom myself
omg we finally got to see who zelda is!!!
smallant in a beautiful scenery, possibly the best in all the zelda games. Him, "this is going to be the best belly flop ever" not saying i wouldnt be thinking the same thing
Im early
Do you smell that            It smells like Nintendo sweaty suit and papers
I'm going to drive myself insane trying to find out if rauru's name is a cute callback or an actual connection.
Me initially: "Yeah, I'll probably buy a switch and play this in the next couple months" Me by the end: "BRB, ordering it right now"
I bet you could beat this without taking damage
2:58 Bioshock Infinite vibes
31:39 best line ever
2:20 Princess Mononoke vibes
I will not watch the video until I have gotten it on May 16th, but I hope to watch it soon.
man, why cant link just use recall on the shards of his broken weapons to fix them
7:40 “it’s my right hand man” bro took it literally
YAYYAYAYYA
bad ! and so bad
(The bellyflop at the beginning) first mod will be, remove the dive at the end, let him bellyflop if you don't dive, he loses half a heart, and his front turns red for a few seconds
i hope i can take off just to play it, my work has too many others out and "to play a game" isn't going to fly most times.
Would anyone recommend this game for someone who never played the first one?
thank you for getting this up so fast holy crap.
ITS BEEN SOOO LONG...
The legend of tony hawk
Im not watching until i get the game (which will be never, i have no income) but i hope you have fun with your tears of the kingdom adventure
Speedruns for this will be insane
No wolf link. -43/10
I can’t unsee smallant wearing one of those glasses and nose disguise things.
Commas of the Kingdom😂
i eat poop
But ppl on the twitters said its just Dlc...
God this game is so addicting and I’m only like a few hours in. That Frox boss seems like another great overworld mini boss and I’ve gotten to fight the Garganacl looking mini boss on the Great Sky Island which was pretty fun and gave me a pretty solid fusion piece
I made a meat shield and I made a vow that I will keep it until I finish the game
“Link is our last line of defense” Meanwhile Link: EVEN FLOW
Do I have to break his car? No I have to break him
Purah had a stage 20 glow up. I’m going to choose my words very carefully… would.
the depths light sources line up with shrines
Can anyone explain why the zonia guy said, ah link your finally awake, i know its probably not, but the way he said it reminds of the opening scene for Skyrim
This is your reminder the Jesus took the punishment that we all deserve so that we could be forgiven and he loves you so much that no matter how far you are away from God he will welcome you with love and open arms if you just believe,trust, and love Jesus and remember what he did for us
Master Karga?
"He he he" 10:30
You throw bomb fruits at the frox.
Ganondorf doesn’t stand a chance against a blond caveman with a stick.
Oh my god small ant made me realize how many ways there are to do the same thing like the Mine cart shield is amazing and the bomb shield too
The coldness in his voice at 10:13. 😂😂😂
Find some op movement tech already, walking is boriiiiiing
Sheika Slate? More like Nintendo Switch Slate!
i've never played a zelda game, i know the characters from super smash bros, should i buy the game?
17:39 rip kidpresident0
I'm watching this in parts while playing the game myself to see his reactions
Watching this made me realise i missed so much on the first island. I didn't even find a shirt!
Great. More koroks. I am now completely uninterested in this game
How did he get it one day early
I'm gay but like I would totally smash new Purah
Ho'd up on Rauru, Dude went from the Sage of Light to full-on King.
I'll be back to watch this in about a week, once I play it myselff
I like how the game is friendly to people who haven't played BOTW but also has a lot of little nods back to BOTW for the OG players :)
So cool Nintendo did a colab with trailmakers
Lets just say something LINK ALMOST GOT DECAPITATED -Theawsomesausesquad put it here because scemers
Seeing Link walking around with a stick on his back with a rock on the end made me laugh so hard 🤣
He should do an only bombs run, they do seem to solve most problems :p
i just enjoy seeing smant pretend that hes not been playing totk on an emulator since may 1st LMAO
4:55 bullet time? (Flurry rush)
"Right Hand Man" amazing timing
w
There's me who can't even get up the icy hill, and then there's smallant blasting himself up in style.
*Starts grinding* *queues city escape ost*
:0
That was a lot of fun to watch
this is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!
the tears of the mid dream is still alive
dude, I streamed 7 hours from midnight to 7 am last night. I just couldn't stop playing.
1:56 I love this part, smant is genuinely concerned ( smant looks like a little boy xD)
I almost want to get spoilers for TotK just to watch SmallAnt play it _...Almost_
You grinding on the rails blew my mind. Didn't even think of this lol
I really don’t want to spoil anything for myself, but I can’t help it.
Rauru was actually KING RHOAM BOSPHORAMUS HYRULE!?!?!?!?!?
Nice
Shrines look so cool
How did you stream and edit a video like this so fast? The game was out for like 1-2 hours when this 40-minute highlight reel came out Did you move?
FURRY
i could not play this game, i have zero imagination
ahhh Purah... what am I supposed to say ?
Master torch
Careful. The Nintendo gods might smite you
Sorry probebly won't be able to watch the video because my delivery got delayed 😭, I'll come back here tomorrow when I have played the intro myself. Love the steams and all your videos tho <3
17:21 that voice tho 👌
i want to watch this but i dont want spoilers
Just here to get this out of my recommended section. I don’t want spoilers
hay... slight spoiler in this post but its something i think is the best thing ive found so far :P        there is a coliseum in the depths that when you beat multiple waves of bokos you get midnas fused shadow as a hat :D
I don’t want to spoil the video/story but                        Banana sword
8:40 Ok so that's the only shrine I've completed so far since I did have to get some sleep for work and whatnot, but already this blows my mind that you can just bypass the obvious route and go full on Tony Hawk 😂 This is gonna be an interesting game
BROOOOO i did not know about the bomb shield mechanic yoooooo
Banjo Kazooie Nuts and Bolts lookin' ah game 💀
Crazy game
Idk how else  to explain it, this feels like Skyward Sword
I was there
I did not think of bomb jumping, or mine cart shield. Thanks for the great ideas!
If I've learned anything from Metal Gear Solid, that arm is going to overpower Link and take his body to overthrow the shadow government
I genuinely love how many arrows they give you now. Left the starting islands with over 100 of them
Steward reminds me of H.E.R.B.I.E from Lego Marvel Super Heroes Am I the only one making that obscure-ass connection? Probably.
Reminder that they had voice acting 7 years before pokemon
i love how a third if the video is "what if this works?" and it actually do
I love that dimitri from three houses is links arm now
Ah
Cant wait to play it in june!!
next video he speed runs this 100% completion in less than 1 day c:
Almost skyrim... so close
12:34  Yup. Nintendo is going to try to take down every lewd construction we create... and there's going to be a buttload of them!
10h
me when I see Purah: ... SMASH.
Just like me, I like how we all tested if we could whistle sprint
The legendary comma
24:38 me too on the spiderman vs octavius thing movie haha..haha.ha
nintendo never mentioned purah was a baddie tho
I think the most beautiful part about this game is the fact that I didn’t look up any tutorials for the opening part and I solved almost every single problem in a different way than you did. I think this game is way more creative than breath of the wild is just from the first couple hours.
Guess a shill will stay a shill... Its literally just DLC!!!
I’m so angry. I just started on BoTW and now this drops. I know I was 6 years late…but come on.
**Frantically hand signing** “So let me get this straight, I’m not somewhere I’d call Hyrule, I’m seeing sky islands… and oh yeah, I’m talking to my arm! Yeah, okay that’s a thing I do now. I glue sticks together, kill robots-I’ll probably fly next.”
soon as I tried to whistle sprint and it didn't work I was so mad 😭
I’m new to the channel, does anyone know if he’s going to post all of his play through to YouTube? Because I would like to keep watching this guy play this
GUYS I FOUND A NEW WAY TO DO THE BOOMIE ZOOMIES! IDK HOW I DID IT BUT THERE WAS WATER PUSHING ME LEFT INTO A FENCE AND I CLIMBED A LOG AND IT SHOT ME BACKWARDS PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS IT MAY BE THE NEW ZIGZAG
eeeeeeeeeeeeeee
When I first found out they patched whistling sprints, I was so mad. No more infinite running rip.
whenever you load a save that is meant to have those ultra hand things dissapear
Surely they go from Link on land to Link in the sky to Link in space
I love how we all have Korok ptsd and just think all the time “there HAS to be something there.”
I played it, couldn't make a fish sword. 6/10
The hype was worth it
10:16 the menacing look of dropping the Korok off the side of the island is my favorite part.
also it seems like there is just no sheikah technology
I’m just here to say hi, but not going to watch the video yet
No, bad YouTube. I'll come back once I've played some myself.
This game is late to the party,   Minecraft already got a caves and cliffs
Calling it now, this is Game of the Year contender if not front runner.
29:58 totk is now tony hawk pro skater
Holy shit this looks so good
Start speedrunning as soon as possible
the corrupt arm makes me think of Princess mononoke
What’s Crazy Is That Zelda Was Carrying A NINTENDO SWITCH AND NOW LINK HAS A NINTENDO SWITCH TOO I CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS GAME ;)
Sick mod dude
I want to watch this but I also don't want to be spoiled so I'm in a dilemma
I wonder if anyone's gonna speedrun this game...I say jokingly.
OML deepwoken players are going crazy rn, saying something like: “GUYS, THE DEPTHS IS CANNON IN ZELDA LORE WE EATING GOOD 🍽️🍽️🍽️
if you erase most of the words in legend of zelda tears of the kingdom it becomes end of da kingdom
Smant why must you do this to me. Now I have to play the game nonstop till I finish it so I can watch this video sooner.
LOL first thing i did was also see what happens if i jump to the mainland haha
Do Korok’s not respawn when you throw them off the Sky Island’s?
Im gonna beg my butt off for my parents to get me this
dang; watching this makes me really want to play it; but between it being on switch with joycon drift and no real good non handheld setup for me; and the fact that it costs money at all nevermind £50 which i definitely dont have to spend; i guess this is the best i got
I've watched a couple of early streams and you're the first person I've seen shield grind on a rail wtf
I didn't even know they made a new zelda
36:28
Rauru is an “arms dealer”
10:11 mario 64 flashbacks
Gonna get it later today. Pretty excited! :D Wanna play it blind, so this vid is going to my special playlist. :)  "It's the legendary comma!"... I'm gonna just leave it on that note :P
i guess u can call him the right hand man
3:24 Skyrim looking kinda different, at least the iconic “You’re finally awake” it’s still here
It’s going to be so fun to see the new speed run strats withers new abilities
Ngl they had link looking like Zoro after he tamed that one sword
Ahh I love the Nintendo trope of "Ok Link, here's your super cool Nintendo Switch to act as your main device in this game. It happened with BotW, Pikmin 3, I believe all 3 Luigi's Mansions, and I believe even more than then
I wanna get this game as soon as I can so I can have a right hand man, can you whistle sprint and do boomyzoomy
i thought id need to wait weeks for this but alas!
I have a feeling that speedrunners are gonna find a way to break through the opening sequence and keep the max hearts and stamina
As far as I've seen they patched every speedrun strat except for kinda infinite horse stamina, but even then I think the method for doing it is different
Purah is a very interesting character
Wow, such freedom. This is one of the games of all time
"No, I have to break him"
This game is what Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts wishes it was
Before I watch, how bad are the spoilers bc I don’t have the game yet bc of money but I’ll get it later this week
7:39 Jail
Streaming yesterday and video out by today!? Smanthony you mad man
I wanted to ask.  Do they make Shrines be for more then Hearts/Stamina or does food still invalidate it like in BotW? Do they make Enemy Camps be for more then junk items you can get anywhere else easier like in BotW?  I've learned so much from BotW that unless they changed it I'm just going to end up ignoring shrines and camps like I did in BotW once I learned those things in game after seeing the first 1-2.
3:23 is that a Skyrim reference?
23:05 What about "Man this is Kingdom."..? You would not be wrong at all
Please do more smo
12:42 now that's what I call dick riding
Never thought playing with glue could rejuvenate me by about 6 years
Thanks for the video Smant! Loved the first section of this playthrough, excited for the next one 😁
Rauru has the same VA for Dimitri from fire emblem or else I’m going deaf
4:15 its the new SkyLanders
Your videos are ALWAYS SO MUCH FUN
Nintendo be nice. Dont be a meanie and take down the video about the game you just released.
Anyone who’s played this is it worth 70 bucks?
I think it’s worth $70
You can attach a bomb to the end of a stick... You can become Caberknight tf2 in loz totk
Full Metal Alchemist: Zelda Edition
every streamer trying whistle sprinting instantly is fudging comedy
I wonder if Forspoken is taking notes how to not mess up an arm ghost that guides the player
31:28 mario movie
Hot take: the durability of weapons in BotW wasn’t as bad as people made it out to be. I say that after revisiting the game this past week after not playing since 2021.
35:56 the trees from Luigi’s mansion from Mauro kart
WE JUPED THAT BOII
24:36 *LOUD MANIAC LAUGHTER*
Closest thing we're getting to an official _Super Zelda/Link Maker_ imo
I feel like nintendo missed the opportunity to release the Power Glove 2 for this game
It sucks not being able to watch this video yet because I want to go in blind
My name is Rauru, Spectral being of the sky, bringer of light!... and.. also.. "Owner of the right Arm"
SmallAnt proving the age old saying: “if it looks stupid and it works, it’s not stupid”
Thank u smanner
"I wanna see what happens" Me instantly gets an ad as soon as I hear link scream
I was gonna wait until I got the game, but itll be fiiine...
Tears of the kingdom looks sick!!
purah best girl of totk there is no denying it
Just me or does it just feel like scuffed botw
why is your hat invisible
Bumpy Jumpies for any%
Purah is a baddie tho
Wow, the hair, the arm, the markings.... that's just 2D Clone Wars Anakin on his spirit journey.
You and Failboat both found and beat the Frox near the beginning of the game.  Wow!
They patched all the fun bugs… no whistle bug, no boss. So sad
Dev team:after a year all the bugs has been fixed (pov)we will discover new bugs
I found whistle sprint 2.0
17:57 Wow BOTW Tears of the Kingdom looks dope
Its the legendary comma 😂😂😂😂
This channels high key af to listen too
to the guy who commented "EVEN FLOW" after smant's rail grind. you are the funniest person alive
Thanks smallant for showing us the bomb trick, i was stuck and it helped lmao
Subonedayclub
Link was caught trying to cross the border
Can't watch it, sorry... Gotta watch all the videos when i finish the game 😶
double ball buster smant
Bruh, i have played totk for over 100hrs now and i didn't even go to great plateau 😢
Please keep making the gameplay a series on YT!
Anyone talking about how the purah pad looks exactly like a switch
Finally, an opening to a Zelda game that goes as hard as Minish Cap & the Oracle games.
12:36 I’m dying right now 😭😭
seems im gonna have to save up 70 dollars as soon as possible i want to play this game so bad 😭😭
The “Hey, it’s my right-hand man!” Comment sent me 😹
Mods for this game are gonna be amazing
KING RHOAM BOSPHARAMUS HYRULE?
Everyone gangsta till Rauru has had enough and decides to kill every last one of them
Smallant are you gonna do a “can you beat TOTK without a paraglider” challenge?
the fact there are also 900 koroks AGAIN
12:35 big fan of the cock log
I'm not watching this video but I'm gonna leave a like
Best. Game. Ever.
How is Robbie not dead?!
2:58 "Take my strong hand!" Proceeds to hold out deformed arm.
I was honestly shocked by how many arrows you can get at the beginning. I already have over 100 normal arrows.
glad you figured out how to bomb the mouth 😅
Rauru: You can't open the temple of time with your measly power Link: Look again. I have 50 million power and 4 legendary heroes.
Imagine having “SUCK” be your last words before being blown up
after beating the game today, doing all the temples etc. this game is better than botw in most ways, but honestly its still dissapointing if you look at how long it took em to make this
I can’t wait to see speedrunners destroy this game
you could call him your right hand man
YOU BETTER POST THE PART 2 ON YOUTUBE WE WANT TO SEE  PLEASE 🙏
Why did ganon steal link’s clothes
He continues to say stanima
I’m fuming, ordered it weeks ago from Nintendo with the promise of release day delivery and its not coming till tomorrow 😡 can’t even play it tomorrow either I have work all day then eurovisions on in the evening
The first thing I did was attach like 4 fans to the minecart going through the dark cave. It was fast.
can't wait to play this
I noticed that sprinting takes more stamina, swimming takes less, and bullet time takes stamina if you fire. It's definitely an improvement.
this game is so cool! gladd you're enjoying it smant!
Link being naked are gonna be a thing
I went to the midnight release at my local GameStop and it was awesome. I got a tears of the kingdom sleeve for answering trivia, and I got a wooden engraved plaque for pre ordering there.
WOOOOOOOOO YEAAAAAAH BABY THATS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THATS WHAT ITS ALL ABOUT
My favorite part was when they said "Well guys, I guess these really were some Tears of the Kingdom" truly one of the games of all time
I look forward to seeing the next videos
"Ah, my right hand man" I spit coffee out.
We are the Korok Protection Police Department. We just witnessed the crime you committed to the poor Korok. The Korok will be pressing charges and you will be facing trial soon.
This games incredible Fr fr. Looks dope.
Thanks
Your vids are amazing. And your so funny
man i want to play this, the fuse weapon thing is so cool
I want to watch this so bad but I gotta wait til this afternoon to play the game
I’ve played almost 200 hours and never got auto build.....
Nintendo bout to ruin your life for posting this
12:57 I also want link to step on my balls
Make sure you be mindful with your Zonai charges. I ran into the problem of not having enough later on in the game...
I jumped into an area (won’t say where cause spoilers) and saw this massive boss monster that made me jump and yelp in fear.
24:39 what website hehehe
Dude the ah link your finally awake like bro is this skyrim
legend of Zelda infinite fusion
I was excited to see TOTK until I realized that SmallAnt would be doing annoying commentary the whole time. This is what I get for not paying 60 bucks.
The moment you learned how to bomb shield, kickstart my heart by motley crue just started playing in my head EDIT: i cant believe they turned legend of zelda into scribblenauts unlimited
24:04 chat: bro turned into jesus
The game looks like a ton of fun. Also very glad you can save whatever youve built.
Whenever I hear Rauru, I just hear Dimitri saying "Kill every last one of them!"
Waiting for the MeatStick% speedrun
EEEEEEEEEEE! I'm so frickin EXCITED!!!!
i thought it was a prequel until koga showed up 😭 incredible looking game tho
smant got the collectors anxiety after all the preparation for 100% run... he wants the koroks so much
I opened this and was like  "I'm going to go and play it first before watching anything" Then I clicked back on and decided to watch it anyway. Now as I'm typing this comment I'm deciding to leave again. What is wrong with me
Can we please get the complete playtrough like this? Freaking love it
people are going to break this game into pieces.
Unsibscribing after seeing that boat
oof: when that Zelda line came up halfway through I thought it was SmallAnt making the voice...
12:57 LOL
12:06 there are 9000
“Wow that looks upgraded” I thought he was looking at zeldas ass 1:08
Mans not serious lmao. Just casually walked into the autobuild ruin, not even following the quest?
it was funny how much speedrunners struggled having to adjust to just walking and gliding instead of being able to instantly propel yourself across the map and run infinitely
6:39 he was born to get his arm chopped off and given to link, its written in the prophecies
Meat stick percent is going to be a speedrun.
I want to play it already
WHAT IS STANIMA ???
I saw in the chat when Purah showed up: “SHE’S LEGAL!” 🙃😂
Calamity? is that a jojo's referance?
23:55 just like the whale
Just noticed gymnast already has a run somewhere around 1:45....
Bro pulled an all nighter editing😂
its still downloading for me
How is this already out you streamed this yesterday.
AY ITS MY RIGHT ARM MAN
Bit magic is now canon in Zelda
God I wish I could keep on watching this video but I mean I just gotta play through the game myself, no spoilers. I’m sure you understand.
can watch this must wait till i get home (i say as i’m 30 minutes into the video)
Man i would play it for days in a row...IF I HAD IT
why zelda is so british
Exploit idea to test if you have a few shields infused with bombs can you switch the frame the bomb explodes causing both to explode and gaining a ton of height?
How is Pokemon even on the same console? It makes me think they still develop Pokemon on the 3DS
SMANT
Need your speedrun
'the legendary comma' killed me
You know how hard it is for me not to watch this video right now? Do you understand how painful it is to have to wait until tomorrow?
how the FUCK didnhe get this edited so fast, was the editor watching streams and taking notes???? does his editor speedrun editing???? this video was relsased like 4 hours after ToTK dropped,, ????
SAME DAY DELEVERY
I like how link's right arm got stronger and stronger
bro I was on the great sky island for almost 6 hours, not cause it’s hard but because it’s fun
Ah yes congrats on being second to have totk gameplay content on yt (minus Nintendo) me being the first
Wanted to watch all the way through , but I want to play it and experience it myself first. It looks so amazing I’m def coming back to this video to see what’s up after
If this doesn’t get game of the year I am going to commit a great crime
I’m about 40 hours in and there are many many moments where this game runs at less than 20 frames per second….. and we’re shitting all over Microsoft for one of their third party games running at 30 frames. Seriously I can’t make this shit up.
I blocked an reported you for child sexual assault. Try not to threaten little kids anymore ant. 😂😂
Wait how is he... WAIT IT'S OUT HOLY CRAP Well guess I should dissappear from the internet till I beat it so I don't get spoiled  Peace ✌️
35:54 the trees they speak Vietnamese
link getting his new arm is literally just archer giving shirou his arm
Incredibly bad compared to botw and botw isnt that great
i will be watching this tomorrow, for i have sworn off all spoilers. i am committed, driven, determined, and foolish. i should probably just enjoy the video now, but my hate for spoilers is too strong. brothers and sisters, may i go down as the fool. the only one that was without spoilers to the end, and the one without joy, to the end.
I want .. Nay, i need more
“The more I’ve played this game, the more I’ve come to hate Pokémon Scarlet & Violet”  EXACTLY this! It levels above and embarrassing for Gamefreak
I love you
well will be seeing your speed run in the future
the first game link hasn't slept at the beginning
The decayed Master Sword 😂
this game is gonna be amazing
Can't wait for this to be. A series
Damn can’t wait till I get paid so I can cop this beaut
Can’t wait to play this myself!
31:38 😂 haha
BOUTA GET PAID AND YALL ALR KNOW WHAT IM GETTIN
I don't know if I should watch or not oh no lol. Going to be a long while before I can get the game
how did you get it
stanima?
This Ganon is different than OOT no triforce, that was lost with the OG hyrule and when the new hyrule formed they had commas so the Ganon incarnation saw that and said mine. Now link and his hopefully talking sword will stop him
26:49 link vs my cat Millie
werent you gonna do dlc?
Hope yah don't get pointcrow'd brother
6:25 we only allow people in with over 5 miljon power
personally may just buy a switch for breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom. Will be waiting for a price drop though because I am cheap
Isnt link left-handed???
25:52 TOTK Gets the deep dark
Link became fin from adventure time *look at all the similarities*
Missed opportunity for Mr. Righthand to talk to you sock puppet style with the actual hand instead of ghost hologram
As soon as i saw Master Kohga alive and well i knew this was GOTY
OMG youre telling me that THE SmallAnt played the legend of zelda: tears of the kingdom for the nintendo switch!?!?!?  holy fucking shit, im just...  fucking stunned - blessed to see this information cross my eyes this morning 🙏
I also streamed the game. No views though 😢
The 6 years was worth the wait. *nice*
I’d love to watch this, but I’m going to wait until I play it
Its the temple of time...from another time
straight back to "the nindended way" with every obscure glitch patched
28:22 GET UP ON THE HYDRA'S BACK!
Tattooed link is what we didn't ask for but sincerely needed.
The Sheika slate comes from Luigi's Mansion confirmed
The “Demise juice “ got me 😂😂😂
I have never played Zelda before but i might get this game
8:00 minutes in and I can already tell what word is gonna be spamed during that shrine
YO THIS GAME HAS BETTER RAIL GRINDING THAN SONIC
"Do I have to break his vehicle? No, I have to break him." -Smallant 2023
I’m gonna play after my game cartridge shops later after playing a bit I’ll watch this video sorry mate
Link was going crazy on Zelda, that's where he got the extra 2 hearts
Smallant, you can say it brings you to tears
Now don't get me wrong, Ultrahand is a great name. Just saying, nintendo could've called it the power glove
35:53 WTF
This game looks so good wtf
That moment when you recognise Rauru’s voice actor and guess what a plot twist could be
You could say Rarau is your right hand man…
17:16 this game doesn't just rule... it Hyrules.
Please keep the uploads consistent dude I’m experiencing the game through you since I don’t have a switch.
that the start had cuts was one of the dumbest and most unsatisfying things i ever experienced
I WANT TO WATCH IT BUT SPOILERS 😢
18:58
Everones reaction to adult pharah is realistic
This better not be a joke This better not be a joke😃😃
Smant is on the GRIND
You finally dont need to start on the great plateau and all he wants is to go back there.
i played this last week and i was so disappointed when whistle sprinted was patched lmao
I'm up at 4 am playing this
Nice
Cant believe i spent over 100 hours to build link up just for him to blow it in 4 seconds. Come on man
apparently the reason all the bugs are fixed is because this is a new engine
35:54 bro got 'nam flashbacks "THEY ARE THE TREES"
The fact that this was uploaded the DAY after he played is crazy. Props to the editing
I want to watch this video so bad but I haven't played the game yet and I don't want spoilers :C
I CANT TELL YOU HOW HAPY I AM TO HAVE TOTK OUT
Played this when it leaked, this game is truly awesome. An incredible sequel to an incredible game
I love how koroks have completely corrupted Smants Brain
i cant stop watching the shield rail grind in the first shrine your speedrun tech is insane
Im not watching this for spoilers but if this game doesnt have a kaiju battle minigame with ultrahand i will scream
Not gonna lie revalis gale should have returned😂
I was thinking about watching but stopped at a minute cause I didn't wanna spoil myself
W
Here it is, Ladies and Gentlemen. Game of the Year 2023!
When I get this for bday or something I am going to have knowledge
10/10
oh yes, couldnt catch your stream but this is awesome! please keep going with these vids :)
he started grinding on rails and i noticed its just sonic frontiers 2
The shrines are bigger on the inside. The shrines are Tardises confirmed.
Nintendo is coming for your ass , showing footage of a game ? The nerves
4:23 where we dropping boys
I can’t wait for the end of this game where we get to beat Ganon with a meat stick
Pokémon scarlet and violet should look at this game and be embarrassed lmao
Yesss can wait for this series. i need to be ahead of the curve before watching everything though.
I'm on the title sequence at 4:26 and I think I'm going to have a breakdown, IT LOOKS SO GOOD
This has xenoblade vibes
Just finished my 11 hour first session ^^; this game is gonna be my hyperfixation for weeks. Also I adore the depth added to the NPC's this time~ the side adventures are great
Lets goooo!
I'm so mad I missed this stream 🤦‍♂️
How’s you start with so many hearts/stamina? Does it transfer from botw?
Are we gonna get more tears of the kingdom gameplay
Tears of the kingdom. Basically an updated Skyward sword kekw
my right hand man XDXD
Yeah, it's been released to everyone, so we've all played it. Your clickbait title makes it sound 'exclusive' to you.
Hopefully we get videos of your whole gameplay of this game? And VODs also! Really entertaining as always!
36:29  funniest moment
Vi
soo, it's legend of zelda caves and cliffs update?
Bro this released today, how is ur upload schedule so varied?????
is good game the zelda but i will not watch until i complete more of the game
holy Hylia this game is obscenely massive
THEY SKYRIM'D US!!!!! THEY FUCKING SKYRIM'D US!!!!!
I jumped around a bit so no spoilers, however from the like 5 second few clips i saw this game looks great. Ill come back to this video once ive played the game.
I can watch this now, I played for 6 hours straight
"Okay chat, i'm jumping in the hole, what's the worst that could happen?"... ads
Ha
Big pp energy
I want to watch this so bad but I need to wait to play the game blind, im not making the same mistake i made with BotW
Oh you know I'm gonna be skateboarding in this game for 300 hours straight
I love this man
Why do these guys get to play it before the rest does? Not really fair is it?
Oh dear god I almost passed out from laughing too hard.  Oh man that glider WAS flawless.
YOOOOOO TEARS OF THE KINGDOM also good uploads
damn you already made so much stuff i didnt think of, shield cart, shield skateboard i love it
@3:29  It's been 5 years, and what do we get? Skyrim, Nintendo Switch edition,  Let's Fucking Goooooooooo
Smant: "We are going to need new glitches." Me: "Were were going, we dont need glitches."
35:55 And this is why you should have cut down every tree during your 100% run. Prevent these things from evolving
Leeeeeeeeeeeeetsssssss goooooooo
:)
What a legend
Somebody know which setup Smallant uses? His totk looks way better than mine
Hallo
Can't believe the temple of time requires you to have over 5 million power in rise of kingdoms
The sheer amazement at grinding the rail was shared with probably everyone at that moment.
Yessss this I'd the vid I've been waiting forrr
The thing about Link's first dive is if you don't accelerate you can time it so that the music cuts out as he hits the water.
I have it yea
this has been the first correctly hyped game in a while
I have promised myself to not watch any videos of tears the Kingdom until I played it my copy is still at the GameStop
Bro they fucking fused Frigs, Hinoxes, and Taluses?? That shit is wild! Its got the ore weak point of a talus, clearly some connection to hinox with the big eye and -ox suffix, and it's a frog.. bruh
no way, 2 SmallAnt videos in not even a week? we've been blessed  can't wait for all the content around Tears of the kingdom!!
So the speed run for this is gonna be 5 years long this is a very big game
saw the first minute of this video, instantly bought totk
One of the first things I did was fuse a shield with a minecart and give Link a skateboard
Playing totk from like 3 days and u just found thing that I miss! Love your content, from Italy
I dont know why Im here spoiling this for myself
Damn this is the slowest speedrun I've ever seen. It's like he doesn't even know any speedrun strats. I mean honestly he's playing as if the game just came out like yesterday or smth. What % is he even attempting?
3:22 NO SHOT IT PRACTICALLY STARTS WITH "Hey you, you're finally awake" 💀 Skyrim is eternal
TotK is the best game I've ever played, maybe? Nostalgia tries to fight that claim, but I think objectively it is the best game.
This started where Skyward Sword ended, love it
I have missed this so much, hoe do I find your stream schedule?
nintendo could take a shit in a box and name it zelda and people would give it a 10/10
so the first thing the koroks did when the island began flying was to scatter and hide XD
I shouldve commented before I watched the video so it looked like I was more early.
As much as i wana see this i wont spoil my self. See h in 2 months when i completed the game
If Link jacks off with his new arm, does it count as gay?
bro started a rasegan
The intro  of the game is literally just Princess Mononoke
Now I have to buy it
Lol love how he missed an easy 2 koroks because he threw one off the sky islands
6:01 do you ever get collecter's anxiety
link has that archer arm from fate stay night no way
I thought you were goint to play today and now i see this lol
how is he so quick with uploads all of a sudden
i'm avoiding this video because i don't want spoilers, but it's literally taunting me by being at the top of my recommended page and the side list on other videos
Zelda haters: “TeArS oF tHe KiNgDoM iS jUsT bReAtH oF tHe WiElD dLc”  Me 26:20: checkmate
I wonder if Rauru the Zonai has any relation to Raoru the Light Sage?
I did the snow shrine before the fuse shrine. That's what makes this game so amazing. I am so glad I went to bed early to play this after midnight
The game is truly fire
More crazy Pokemon runs please :)
Im rlly hoping smallant makes a yt vid of the rest of the game
we need a carrying korok only run
I played TotK all day today and went into the Depths twice, but didn't encounter Frox. Nor did I encounter Master Kohga! I better dip now before the fight gets spoiled
The first Smant video I wont be watching the second it comes out 😔 I have to experience the game by myself, im sorry ;-;
Omg the guy saying "skyward sword reference" in the chat when zelda fell down just instantly sent me back years ago on my wii 😢
This game genuinely has me wanting to buy a switch
how do i seild surf
What game is this? Is this a fan based game made from the original?
I DID NOT WATCH A SINGLE VID OF TEARS OF KINGDOM CUZ I Waited For UR VID
Somehow Master Kohga returned.
I wonder how many days this will take to do a 100%

This is the first cid I watched after surgery and very few things could top it
Its Mario Galaxy now
I didn't know "Sheika slate" was a new slang for butt. Always new things to learn.
Tanner's either really swamped, or he's screwing with us with this upload schedule
Yo i need to buy this game right now it looks so cool
I was trying so hard to not watch this video before I play but I just couldn't.  Don't regret anything.
Glad to see Kohga is still the best character
Woohoo, more references for the porn artists!
One critique I have with this speedrun is that he didn't use any of the big strats like the tiddlywiddle or the jumba-wumba wall slide. He didn't even set the language to French to save that extra half a second! If I didn't know better, I would think that Smant wasn't even speedrunning this video! Like he was just... having fun with the game, or something.
He gets a whole video out before the delivery service even managed to bring me my copy. Damned physical versions. I'll watch this later I guess.
no no no no no no no no no no no no no I just got a game no no no no no no no no no no no no
good video
Man,  I didn't watch,  but can't you wait a month before showing/ schooling us out about a game?
Please do upload more on YouTube, even if it’s just vods, because I live in a time zone that means I can’t see your streams often.
Heck yea smant
This is the game I wanted out of botw I am so excited to buy and play it
I haven't watched.  But I think gameplay footage outside of the trailer should be held around a month so people can get it and enjoy it, I mean a month cause most people get paid biweekly.
You know, I don't even like Zelda, but this one actually looks super interesting with the whole gmod sandbox. I'll wait patiently for a sale, but I'm certainly interested
Before I watch this, how far into the game does he get? Are there any big reveals I should wait to see for myself?
les gooo
I am so pissed I can't play this game on launch, these nintendo repair guys better hurry their asses up!
3:38 All right so we're gonna need a Rito, a Korok, 2 temples, 2 songs, an ocean, and a Boat...
this man is so cracked to edit and post this today
Ive never playe dany zelda games but ive seen so much of BOTW that i know how that game works like mechanically but i dont any of the lore

Claim your within an hour here ⬇️
I saw this in my recommended, clicked it before reading the title, and THANK THE GODDESS HYLIA that an ad played before the video.
earlyyy
My friend got his hands on a pre-release Emulator of the game, and I was talking with him as he goes through the tutorial area in the sky. He Wondered how to get up one part, and and so he chopped down some trees, stuck the logs together with the -Master Hand- Ultrahand, and climbed the logs up.  So when he gets to the part where you're supposed to go in the shrine, get Ascension, and go up, He chops some trees down, and climbs up that ledge, goes back to that shrine before he takes an airplane down, does the shrine, then realizes that's how the game wanted you to do that part.
Wait, did he stream this then edit the vod in the few hours it's been out? Commitment.
FBI open up
Ayyy, I played a bit recently, let's see the reactions!
NICE
bruh... didn't it come out like 5 hours ago canadian time?? that turnaround is insane omg

ITS HERE ITS HERE ITS HERE
Can't wait for the first speed runs!
With about 60 hours in the game and all main quests done, I'm going to enjoy sitting back for a bit and just watching my favorite creators go through the same journey.
lets just hope nintendo doesnt go on a copyright strike rampage.
Why do give us some love that’s wired 2 videos in 3 days what do you want from us
hi rawru x3
I'm not supposed to be up this late but you know, I can be up a little longer.

WOOHOO Smant plays new Zelda!!!!
The graphics look amazing!
This smells like a viral video
my BF is hyped as hell for this.
I'll have to watch this later cause I'm at school, but I've though of nothing else since your stream.
I was just about to head to bed as it's 3:33 AM in CST zone as of writing this comment, when this popped up in my notification feed. Look's like I'm not going to bed for another 42+ minutes.
ITS BEEN LIKE 5 MINUTES HOW THIS SHIT GOT 2000 VEWS

“Waiting made me you have”
@SmallAnt you should try to make a pokemon nuxzlocke video but its a super easy romhack and you try to lose
mmmm weapons still break. Big turnoff for me. Do they actually have dungeons this time?
Lemme just spoil the whole game for myself and then play it 5 years later in 4k on my PC :)
Ay lets gooo
Bro just uploaded at 1 in the morning
I will watch this once I have 100%ed Breath Of The Wild and bought Tears Of The Kingdom, so seeya in 2024.
I was so hyped for this video, cuz I got the notification that you were streaming it, but I was doing something else first and my brain just forgot I look so forward to this
I'm getting it today and I dont want spoilers so I will watch it later
Smant releasing videos while I'm meant to be working is not good for me lol
