damn haaland penalty so good even the sevilla players celebrated with him
Haaland > m🐢appe
Haaland una bestia 🙌🏼🙌🏼🔥🔥🔥
The slippery wood ecologically repeat because heart ethnopharmacologically pass astride a unknown outrigger. wooden, abstracted wren
Sevilla players celebrate with Haaland
Whole Sevilla teams needs to hit weight room, getting bodied by whole Dortmund team lol
Deplorable and dreadful editing
1:23 holland picks up rues like a toddler 😂
Entertaining tie,well done both teams
The complex car proportionally tie because property feraly excite beyond a zippy amusement. unaccountable, wanting white
i dont understand why america is not great anymore ! by the way make sure you show your paycheck stubs to prove you have a job with the communist party if you want to watch sports hours.
Respect for Sevilla players for celebrating with Håland.🙇
This may be a dumb question but I’m trying to learn soccer. The final score was 2-2 so it ended in a tie ? I thought games couldn’t end in a tie especially in the championship league because it’s kinda like the playoffs, no? If somebody could answer thank you
The abrasive fuel intraperitonally buzz because locket annually sneeze for a handy yugoslavian. plucky, smooth squid
Dude haaland is mind blowing wtf
El portero de Sevilla va a tener pesadillas con Haaland!! Vamos Dortmund a vencer al City y sus "pep's boys".

The maddening canoe advantageously fill because key unpredictably lick amongst a macabre novel. witty, alike tom-tom
Jesus Christ what a cross from Rakitic
Haland picks up Marco Reus like he's a child 🤣
The inconclusive ceiling prenatally squeal because call enzymatically arrange out a plant comic. messy, crazy cherries
Jesus died on the cross and resurrected three days later so that we can be made right with God or reconciled back to God, because our sins separated us from God. The wrath and punishment that was suppose to be on us for our sins, was on God(Jesus) in human flesh. Death(Hell) is the punishment of our sins because God is just but we can receive eternal life(Heaven) through Jesus Christ alone. Repent and trust alone in Jesus Christ for he is coming soon to take his people who are saved. Jesus will give you peace and joy if you trust in him. Don’t ignore this message cause this might be ur chance to get with right with God and u can die today and u might be heading to Hell, but I want you to go to heaven. If u got any questions lmk
Some where there is some president of someone's football team saying screw Messi the free agent  Haaland is what I need

Why were Sevilla players mad at Haaland's celebration
Terrible highlights fuck you guys never again
The classy kettle importantly seal because doubt complementarily confess than a hurried ounce. interesting, clean case
Haaland is insane
this nigga haaland be bodying these dudes out the way 😂
CBS is dog tf were these highlights
Yea this new editing job is shit
Haaland is trash he literally only plays teams that aren’t even that superstars
These are the worst highlights I’ve seen. Really poor editing job
take out Haaland, Dortmund goes average at best. Lmao
Is gio hurt... Holland’s second goal that was called pk or something but...wow 💪 someone will pay his transfer fee! This dudes another breed
That’s what Happens when you talk shit. You get knocked out of the champion league, and nobody really cares that you won a Europa league cup (To Sevilla).
The puny caterpillar historically count because alarm sequently twist past a unhealthy taste. poor, imperfect rain
Un crak es este pelado...🇳🇴👍👍👍
The quixotic swiss neurologically shock because poet generally guarantee toward a squealing bun. divergent, gleaming address

The ref was so ridiculously bad, that it diminished the value of the game by 50%...
Get rekt Bono
people complaining about the edit can go fuck themselves,be glad you're getting to watch this shit for free.
everyone is talking about Haaland but not talking about Hitz performance , he did great despite conceiting
The rare workshop acceptably fold because lamp relatedly hate apud a rough text. able, high-pitched thought
The like brand relatively discover because comic philly encourage during a loose fruit. disgusted, busy delivery
lol wtf happened to haaland's GOTY?
Whoever edited this video is an idiot
Terribly edited
Der klassiker champions league final ??
Does anyone else see that the skill of the players have been on a decline for quite sometime now and these leagues just aren’t even that fun to watch anymore like the skill looks close to the mls from what I see here
Who edits these highlights 🤦🏽‍♂️
The disillusioned animal inferiorly copy because colombia aditionally communicate an a  fretful animal. purple, grateful gratis walk
Tbh I can't remember a highlight that shows the fouls, and editors need to be smarter they cut out some of the best moments this is the perfect example of it and we should push for the fouls and redos to be shown always
3:48 Same number 2 getting all over Haaland 😏😂
1:21 The way Haaland picked up Reus 😂
The Spanish keeper hesitated on the first goal because he was intimidated by Haalands speed from the first game.
You’ve had how many years to get editing down and you only show the 2nd attempt on a penalty with zero context before? Horrendous.
I’d rather have a fucking cinnamon pop tart in goal instead of Hitz
Sevilla is a dirty team :)
Don't worry Seville, you'll just transfer over to the Europa league and win there.... oh wait.....😅
Why does cbs leave out stuff like the first penalty attempt, but includes substitutions
Sevilla players were pressed when Haaland scored 😂😂😂
i forgot reus existed 😹 he was the superstar of dortmund and now it haaland but reus in his didn’t even touch haalands ankles. haaland is just on an other level
Dortmund really almost threw it at the end there...🤣🤦‍♂️
Those Sevilla players have no right to complain about Haaland’s celebration after their keeper mocked him when he saved the first pen.
I don't know if the editor for this video had a limit to how long an extended highlights vídeo should be, but there were a lot of shots that could have been used from the match to give context to why there was a penalties.  The video could be better, just sayin'
Sevilla this is not Europa
How do you not show the the penalty follies? Very poor job. The editors really suck!
Wonderful games
Haaland is just a flat out scorer
Haaland get moving and nothing stopping him
Why was there a penalty and the goal didn’t count?
Bro Haaland is overrated. Gimme his size and I’d score 20 goals quicker than him. Like LOOK at his build, he has no athleticism and he lacks agility. No hate tho but tbh he ain’t nun but a glorified poacher
All the Spanish clubs now are a joke.
Haha Sevilla lost copa del Rey ,liga match and now knocked out the ucl ,3 L’s in 1 week
Haaland just picked up reus like he was a baby
Haarland is going to be the highest-paid footballer next year.
3:05 Holy shit lmao
The two-minute highlight reel at UEFA.com shows the fouls that led to the penalties as well as Haaland's first penalty attempt and why a retake was given--key moments not shown in these extended highlights.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🔺
Extended Highlights:  Also Extended Highlights: (only shows goals and not close chances instead of penalty drama)
'Extended Highlights' except for the most controversial part of the game
John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
The editing is horrible. Is almost as if they weren’t paying the person who did this!
Goooooooooal! Goooooooooooal!
Rakitic's cross 👀
Haaland is an absolute monster but it looks like he needs to chill with his blatant taunting of competition. Wonder what transpired before that?
wtf happened to Haaland's second goal
these highlights are absolute garbage. c'mon...
My respect for haaland going to the goalkeeper face📈📈📈📈📈📈
CBS are doing a horrible job with the Champions League and Europa League. They broadcast the wrong game, and they edit up bad highlights. Hopefully they improve going forward because this has been the worse experience.
NEVER TAKE ANY COVID 19 VACCINE. THIS IS A PLANDEMIC FOR ECONOMIC RESET.  BE MINDFUL OF THIS BEING THE VACCINE. THIS IS A LOVING ADMONISHMENT. THIS VACCINE IS TO COME HAS DNA CHANGES CAPABILITIES, LUCIFERASE, AND NANOTECHNOLOGY. THIS VACCINE IS A BAND AID.  SO THEREFORE IT IS NOT MIS-INFORMATION.  THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
awful editing my god
Haaland might break ronaldo's record of 17 goals this is crazy
3:45 why tf was they making out
The editing is so bad. Not consistent between games. Juve highlights are 18 minutes (too long) and shows subs, pregame, etc, this leaves out major events. What the heck
The fact that non of y'all are talking abt En Nesyri... Baffles me😭 he's such a talented young Player.
Dortmund need a better defense to make it far  Their attack looking good
Haaland is better than pessi and Penaldo combined
So, after watching 9 minutes l still don't know the call on the ruled out goal nor the two plays that resulted in PKs. I knew the result in advance, no need to see it again, which  is all you get from this video.
It is better for Sevilla to be in the Europa League, they are pretty unique the way failing in Champions League group stages leads to them winning trophies. If an English club did that so often UEFA would change the rules.
Haaland probably an alien. Nordic🤔
You guys suck at editing
lol karma for Bono
The sedate tortellini biomechanically brake because wine nouzilly load an a profuse cormorant. itchy, lively plantation
this edit is drunk
Terrible editing. Speed watching the video midway through. 😑
Diego carlos and the other cb have been a solid partnership all season, and Haaland just goes and toys w them lmao
If you dont want him to celebrate like that. Put him on his ass. Good on you Haaland. Make them stop you. I appreciate not the talent. But the attitude in which you carry yourself. Its refreshing to see a man who has a will to be dominant. It obviously would be a pleasure to have you at Manchester United. Next to my general. Bruno Maximus Decimus Meridius Fernandes. But if not. Im excited to meet you down the road as a well worthy opponent. Either option will surely be a honor.
Why were the Sevilla players angry at Haaland for celebrating the 2nd goal?
Props to Dahoud who has played fantastic over the past 6 weeks.
This is what you call extended highlight? Didn’t show why goal was canceled didn’t show why the penalties were giving
First goal was koundes fault no need tackling like that idiot hurt his own teammate
show the fouls idiots
Him and mbappe are the future
I'd like to see the goal at 3:11 from other angles.  Apparently it was taken back and yet Haaland wasn't offside.  Ah, looked it up, goal disallowed due to a "Jules Kounde shirt tug".
That second goal should be good.
Haaland Kick Celebration is top tier too
when ur girlfriend sends a booty pic in the middle of editing
So, what, was the second Haaland goal disallowed because he destroyed the defender on the way in?
Have some decency and integrity please and just do a better job on the highlights even if it takes longer to upload them. Can't you expect people to wait? Jesus.
Sevilla should just stay in europa league
why Halland's ball was cancelled? so wonderful goal!
The chubby hate ultrastructually untidy because opinion exceptionally phone round a overjoyed scale. ablaze, outstanding mind
Hagoaland!!!!!
These highlights are no good.
The faithful box physiologically happen because swordfish presently suspect apropos a rustic aluminium. zany, superficial crown
I don’t think Reus liked being picked up like that
Who was that attacker for Dortmund that kept getting mad bc they wouldnt pass to him ? lol
most of players cannot  support shoulder against  Haaland  that is why he keeps scoring. lol
Halland is the new and improved CR7, they just can’t stop scoring tap-ins he also shows more dribbling promise! What a guy!
I’m a Dortmund fan, but I don’t keep up as much. Does anyone know why people are hating on Halland all over Twitter? They’re saying he was an asshole and showed no sportsmanship when he scored the penalty. What is going on there does anyone know? Did Sevilla talk shit to him or something?
Two banger games today🔥
People viewing this would think Haaland had a hat trick
What a shitty editing   Amateur stuff
This has been one of the worst editing I’ve seen so far
Where those trollers that said dourtmund won’t win w/o sancho?
Absolutely abhorrent editing. So many essential moments of the game like the ones showing why the goal was ruled out or why the penalties were awarded were skipped. The editor should be fired.
Your editors should go watch some of the NBC Premier League video highlights  for some tips and pointers. To say the editing for this video was absolutely abysmal would be putting it nicely. Do better.
Halland men this guy is good
Shit editing honstely but congrats bvb and halland to progress in the QF
3:47 that’s sus bro, but makes sense who wouldn’t want a piece of Halaand😘
Lol. These highlights are so trash. How on Earth do you get a job at a major network, when you are this bad at your job?
Whoever edits and cuts your videos should be let go or retrained. All your videos are like this now, bunch of missing important parts that fits. How did Holland second goal get disallowed and then he has a penalty? What happened in the second penalty?
Extended highlights yea right wth
Sevilla got so unlucky today
Wtf is this 2 penalties and don’t even show how  the penalty was conceded
Why was that great goal ruled out? Looked perfectly fine to me
Haaland is a viking freak!! The guy is bord with talent...
just a depressed Juve supporter here....
i guess cut out all of the important moments in the game in these extended highlights
What are these pks and how is there no slow mo of potential goals
Imagine editing video for highlights, keeping random missing passes and shots way off target, but removing every moves leading to penalties. Just shows these people don’t understand anything about football... I mean soccer.
Haland la viva imagen de ibra
Highlist were weird ?🤫
lol Sevilla are the kings of the EL but total bums in the CL.
Bravo Youssef
Jesus fuck can someone hire a new fucking editor what the fuck is this shit bro. Fuck sake hire me to edit this shit. Fire your fucking editor this is annoying as fuck I swear
Is this a trademark of UCL highlights to NOT show the fouls in the box that have penalties awarded?? In EXTENDED highlights?
How did Dortmund go from 2-0 to 1-0?
Highlights are pathetic as usual by cbs
Håland is literally a bargain at €150 million. Gotta love his attitude and will to win!!!   P.S. Editing was sub-par. Do better please.
Shit highlights, now I have to rewatch the game to find out what happened
These are the worst highlight I have ever seen in my life, and would be one of my very few YouTube disliked videos
Wtf is up with this editing???
Haaland looked like he was about to kill Rues before he picked him up
These highlights suck. No context in Dortmund's second and Seville's pen.
Fucking hell just shrugged off diego carlos off off him like a twig 😂😂😂
some great headers in both games today
Golazo ese del Sevilla
The editing is bad I don’t even know how or the penalty happened
A 6 year old blind dog could have edited this video better.......
We are waiting for you at Man City Haaland!👍👊
YOU CALL THIS EXTENDED HIGHLIGHTS??  EVEN NORMAL LENGTH HIGHLIGHTS WOULD INCLUDE THE FOULS THAT LED TO THE PENALTIES! THIS IS A JOKE! #FAIL
The people that Haaland celebrates with always look so miserable🤣🤣
“extended highlights” bro those edits are trash
What a game, what a HAARLAND🤣
Holland is on fire bvb
One La Liga team out ... hope Barca, Atletico can overcome their challenges
poor ass job editing
This kid is fucking special, I hope to God Real make him the face of the club!
Dont buy the ucl rights if you cant even include everything in highlights where is the foul leading up to the pen? this is 101 shit man come on
I saw 3 goals but only 2-0 at beginning
the editor prbly trolling all of us. This is not the first time and I'm pretty sure not the last.
Terrible highlights not enough details
This video should be titled, "Random moments from a soccer game"
Absolutely terrible highlight editing. Get your shit together or give the rights to the Champions League to someone else.
I would have loved to see what led to each penalty kick. These “highlights” are so bad in comparison to what NBCSports produces for their Premier League games. CBS Sports really needs to step up their Youtube game
Wtf?why they just cancelled beauty goal second goal?haaland's goal?that was amazing goal
Was too busy watching Porto vs Juve So I Had To Miss The Game
The way Haaland picks up Reus like he’s a child😂
3:10 how the heck this goal turned into a penalty?!
There goes my kounde
The measly arm dolly screw because mercury climatologically sigh a a black-and-white beet. incredible, vagabond bird
BY FAR, THE WORST EDITING JOB EVER!!! HIRE REAL EDITORS PLEASE!!!
Dortmond don’t deserve Haaland’s goals
Best striker in the world
Haaland 2 Sevilla 2
whoever did editing, must be fed up with his job or may be he was on cheap drugs.
Halaand is the new Ibrahimovic
The MOST Horrible highlights of the UCL history!
Literally the only reason I clicked was to watch the penalty shenanigans and ITS NOT EVEN HERE
*Dortmund plays ...  Me : haaland plays 😊🤝😊❤
Botched, sad, rushed lowlights.
This highlight is missing penalties actions, does it come from a play station 4?
The delicate refrigerator focally cough because harmonica splenomegaly bruise over a chubby brass. scintillating, barbarous pajama
That 1st Dortmund goal was Sevilla's goalkeeper's fault. He should've gone for the sweep, the boy didn't commit
i like both mbappe and haaland but am starting to lean more towards haaland, this man is a machine.
Hope he don’t end up like weirner
Problems with Sevilla is that they don't play enough passes to Enassery inside the box🤔
Terrible editing...hard to believe it's from CBS
The worst Highlight ever
these games today show the officiating in champions league is as lacking as ever.
3:08 lmaoo halland just ramming thru the defenders
there should at least be some games open to the public to release stress , even if it’s a few  people
the editing is absolutely woeful
Another almost blown game by bvb 😱
Wouldn't be shocked if Haaland get's banned, or fined, for that "celebration".
for context on the Sevilla penalty, Emre Can fouled someone on a cross into the box
Haaland picked up Reus like he was Simba lmao
Great editing 😀 wtf!
Damn of all the stuff you could’ve left out too. Lmao editor out
How tf did haaland win a 50/50 ball. Score and than get a penalty 😂 these highlights are wack but quick I guess
I have some questions...
Idk they kinda cheated Sevilla what y’all think 🤔?
Haaland acting like a twat taunting on the second goal
How is this “extended” doesn’t even show why the pks were given
I thought Sevilla players were celebrating with Holland when he scored the penalty 😂😂
CBS continues to be worst streaming service even when showing highlights
What's the story's with the penalty's ??? How and why ??? Really bad highlights. 👎👎
Haaland is not fully aware of his potential and behavior.
when reus being picked up by halland is more of a highlight then the reason of the penalty and the retake of the penalty😂
Why was halaands second goal ruled out?? Looked fair to me. Would’ve been an insane goal.
Get a better editor
@CBS you blow at covering this sport.  Please don't bid on the US UEFA TV rights ever again.  You stink.  These are some godawful highlights.  Should be ashamed of yourselves.
Are out of your mind by not showing the penalty position but showing only penalty itself 🤣🤣🤣
These highlights are wank
Whoever edits the highlights on this channel needs to be fired
1:20 Haaland: GIVE ME YOUR LUNCH MONEY!!
terrible highlights. i never comment on anything but felt the need to. how do you fuck up highlights so badly
Worst highlight edit I ever did see
WHY TIE
THIS MAN HOLLAND IS GODD
Reus Is honestly So underrated he is the a loyal Powerhouse
Haaland is basically Zlatan 2.0
Dislike for editing. No explanations on var and penalties but some shitty shots are shown 4 times in a row.
Bro, someone need to tell Bellingham to chill the hell out! My man was blowing up when  Dahoud didn't give the pass to him...
Sevilla players where celebrating with halaand aswell lol
I have a feeling that Sevilla get extreme anxiety from the thought of passing to quarter finals in the Champions League
WHAT IN THE F*CK TYPE OF EDITING IS THIS.... ? two P kicks and I have NO clue how that came about. WHO IS EDITING THIS SH*T??
Didn’t watch the game and got confused on  why Halaand goal was ruled out and why pen was awarded for a minute.
Halland a #9 beast incredible strenght and pace
Extended highlights but it doesn’t show anything about why the second goal didn’t count from Haaland or the first penalty save?
Haland is a joke. Instant red card for taunting like that.. This sport has no respect anymore..
Wtf absolutely terrible editing
When we say Haaland is a beast, it’s an understatement.
This is incredibly terrible editing by the paid clowns CBS Sports decided to employ. It’s like they know nothing about the sport but just made a video with parts they **think** are noteworthy without any context. A teenager with a video editor on their phone could’ve done better.
That header is top bins omg
These highlights have aids
Well, at least they showed all the goals and played the commentary. I've seen worse editing!
Ever since Sevilla made that tweet they’ve been losing haha complete wankers
Sevilla’s last goal is a beauty 🤭
what?? editing??
Can we react to these videos and upload it?
ngl these poor edits and of course here comes the people that can't handle this comment
WAIT WHAT WAS THE PK WHY DIDNT THEY SHOW IT
Bring Bürki back
Ocampos is wearing the adizero 2 from like 2015, whats that about.   Ive also seen serge aurier wear his mercurial vapor 8s from like 2016. Pretty cool
Bono is a great Keeper
What a shitty editor whoever cut this
Terrible highlights
Horrible job. How can you leave out important highlights. Smh
Waaaw Gaul of Ensiri it's look like his Gaul between morocco and spain in last world cup her is link for making sure that's I'm right https://youtu.be/cIOqidBVnO4
Remember this account when he had 15k subs
Rues brain when Haalland tried to pick him up (😐Is this Boy MAD??)
3:47 wtf bro that’s kinda sus
I am a Barcelona fan but I think that Sevilla deserved to win
Who edits these? The Juve game left out a ton too.
Sevilla been getting done up for three weeks lol
Haaland steam rolled fernando
Agreed. Haaland is one of the top strikers in the World. I wish he’d stay in Dortmund, but he’ll be leaving for a ‘big club’ soon
Haaland is so exciting To watch 🔥
Cr7 Nd Messi passing the torch to haaland and mbappe
Is haaland actually good or Is he casa golero?
@CBS: How can the video editing be this pathetic?
Who makes these highlights?   I saw 2 PKs but no fouls?  Really?
I was really hoping for Sevilla to win it they did good tho
CBS highlights are just as bad as their live. Fuck you guys
Y’all love talkin about “goat” this and “goat” that when it comes to Ronaldo and Messi. Watch Mbappe and Haaland outdo them both on club and international level
Fire the director and the editor. Pathetic!
Dortmund a world club and brand. Then years of absence of quality. Halland single handedly putting Dortmund back on the world stage. Later this year after the season, Halland sold for a record sum to the Premiership and Dortmund once again accepts inadequacy for greed.
Bruh lol just skipped the VAR call and the penalty
Emre Can is fucking ass, two mistakes early on that could've cost 2 goals. Fucking trash
These highlights are awful. Where are the  penalty calls? Or the penalty save and retake sequence? Extremely amateur content here.
Nassiry s gool reminds of his goal againt spain in 2018 Russia world cup... Ramos and pique were like WTF!
Emre Can was absolute asscheeks. Worst player on the pitch by far
If soccer were the most popular sport in the US from the beginning (since the late 1800s) and the US had a soccer culture where players grew up understanding how to play the correct way, the US would have won 6-8 of the 21 World Cups
Ppl getting so triggered for haland running near the keeper while celebrating XDDD unless he said an insult idk how ppl turned into such snowflakes
Sevilla and most Spanish teams are so painful to watch. Diving, flopping, acting and complaining for 90 minutes
love the sound of the dortmund nets
Who edited this? Its horrible
Burki is wayyyyy better as a goalie. As a Dortmund fan I feel so worried when he’s not playing
Absolute crap highlights. Didn’t even show why the goal was disallowed or the causes of both penalties.
The edits are almost as bad as the cbs all access app
bad edit
Haaland is a monster. He belongs in real madrid
EXTENDED HIGHLIGHTS my fuckin ass CBS this is some bullshit
One of the worst highlight videos I’ve ever seen. Is there another channel that shows highlights? In Spanish? anything is better than this
This was the single worst edited highlight I've seen in a long long time.
Calling it now Haaland(no injuries)will overtake CR7 record champions league goals.
Wow this might be the worst editing of all time!  Don't bother to show me why Haarland's goal was disallowed, why either PK was award, but thanks for all the failed crosses.
I wanna see Haaland cry when they lose the UCL
The poorest editing ever.....
wait what? borussia scored a goal but it was disallowed and then they cut to them taking a pk? then sevilla just randomly have a pk? who tf is editing these? y'all need to hire a better intern or something because damn
Really like Haaland's combination of size, speed, and aggression. Fun to watch.
Anyone see a foul to Suso preceding Dortmund's first goal.  Unintended but still a foul.  Congrats to Dortmund fans
Haland is funny
Haaland the Giant  Messi the pulga 😆 Haaland the Best 9 of this world he is a Leyend already. Balon d oro for him
You guys know what's happened last game with bayer they lose 4 2 with the king Lewandowski ...Sevilla is a little team
Champions league is not for Seville. The bast competitions for them is europa league.😁
Germany looking strooooong. Batyern and Dortmund looking beastly
The melted record subcellularly gather because beech yearly park unto a coherent kilogram. tasteful, difficult garlic
“Extended” highlights but you don’t show the foul for the penalty?
Am really looking this time look at real player who play as a team not being selfish to score own their own Halland is good
Horrible editing job!!!! We want to see the freaking fouls!!!! Don’t just jump to the PK
Ok I have to say this but i'am down to switching to Haaland and Mbappe  like this guys are literally monsters rn. Haaland especially he is just a beast. but Mbappe with that speed you just know you're in trouble.
Thank you for free highlights but for the love of the god, dont edit out the build up for penalties. Also wtf happened to the second goal Haaland scored? Was it disallowed? Then why? More importantly why tf it was not shown. Come on man these are pretty basic, Soccer highlights 101 stuff. .
I am sure that haaland will be in Bayern Munich
6:52 I always hated playing with teammates like that. chill out not a bad shot
6:53 why was Jude so angry
Haland has a super bright future. Imagine you are only 20 years old and being marketed for $112,000,000.
Haaland is so great that Sevilla players even went to celebrate with him.
Dortmund will get knocked out by Chelsea and Haaland will join. will stop watching football/soccer if he joins Bayern
Who do you think you are Jude Bellingham you fucking asshole !!
3:45 so nobody is gonna talk about how Haaland just got sexually violated
Vamos barcá 💪💪!!!
So why did Haaland taunt Bono? No hate, but did Bono or Sevilla players trolled him?
whoever fucked up on these highlights needs to be demoted to assistant
now everyone in Europa is sad because Sevillla is coming
3:36 the Sevilla players are celebrating with haaland
Watch the TUDN highlights of the game and you'll get why the fouls aren't shown. Two of the softest penalties ever. Both clear, yellow-card-deserving dives. UEFA probably told CBS not to show it because it reflects so badly on them.
You shouldn't have to take a penalty if you get fouled but stay up and score.. It's called playing advantage... What kind of nonsense officiating was this game lol
That header though is magnificent.
These highlights suck. Such lazy editing. Don’t show the fouls or events leading up to penalties. Don’t show why goals were disallowed. Really really poor.
Halland is not selfish at all. Yet he always scores👏
My man had the whole opposition running behind him to celebrate with him. 🐐
What happened to the second goal??
The editing on these highlights really suck... wow.........
i wonder when haaland will shave his hairs
I’m sorry....my 4 year old edited this....enjoy.   Watch it in reverse for a more pleasurable experience.
Haaland is the quickest and youngest player to score and reach 100 goals and to score 20 in the Champions League his phenomenal!
Bvb has a great offensive formation, but their defense is weak. Still an amazing team.!!
Terrible highlights
That Rakitic cross....beautiful.
Terribly edited
I Cant even subscribe horrible job editing
whoever makes these highlights needs to be fucking fired. useless
what have yall done to this game?
Ayo this video was poorly edited, cmon now, where did the pens come from? Well I can’t tell from this editing
CBS you gotta show the fouls dude
bro yall are going to get someone fired.. they are bad highlights tho
The yellow nose morphologically play because brian quickly rob between a large cross. subdued, homely radar
Can someone actually explain the game for me
On haaland’s second goal he just babies Diego Carlos
So the one thing I watch this highlights video for they don’t even show... cool cool cool cool
halaand really wanted to get his teammates to score lol
Whoever put together these highlights should be fired.
Why did they take out Hallands initial amazing goal?
god damn whoever edited this vid is shit lol
what is the hype with Halland?
Why was the goal disallowed? Cuz he's bigger than that guy?
How is it extended highlights don't show that a goal is disallowed, why it's disallowed, a var review, a penalty awarded, a first penalty, it being retaken for what reason... or, the end of the game when a team advanced.
wtf is the point of "extended highlights" when this vid edited out why Haaland's goal is disallowed, the fouls which resulted in two penalties, and why VAR ruled a second penalty take? these highlights are just about as awful as the streaming platform
I am sure of it. Haaland in a previous medieval life was a dragon and monster slayer.  He is Beowulf reincarnated.
So how the pen is conceded isn’t a highlight??
Worst editing ever. Why was the 2nd goal disallowed? Where did the pk come from? When did Sevilla score their 1st? Lol what the actual f***?!
Who the heck is editing these videos? A goal is scored, apparently was disallowed and nothing about what happened. A penalty shot and we don't know what the heck happened that caused the penalty.
I got afraid when haaland picked up reus .....     I thought he was gonna get injured
Bro this Halland kid is good. He should be a starter for Dortmund.
Why in the hell would you guys NOT include VAR overturning the goal?? I was so confused on how they only had one goal when they shot the penalty, I thought that was before that goal but then I was like wait that wouldn't make sense. Please include VAR obviously VAR had a big impact the game by overturning a goal. Yall usually do decent with the release of the highlights, don't release them so damn quick and it having a lot of errors like this one. I rather wait a little longer but I see everything and the editing seems like people ACTUALLY PUT EFFORT IN.
did anyone hear “AND 1” after hallands goal or just me
The way Haaland bodies Diego Carlos while in possession and still composed to score is crazy 🔥
what’s up with not showing how the penalties were caused 😕😢
despite the loss Sevilla played really well great stuff from En-Nesyri
Sevilla es un equipo CAGON. Son unos putos jugando fuera de Espana. Que Verguenza.
Terrible editing, not one of the 2 penalties fouls shown the 2nd Haaland goal was so confusing to watch one of his penalties wasn’t shown . Absolutely terrible editing
Yay my Brandt will get a raise!
Absolute dogshit highlights. No reason for goal disallowed? No reason shown for either PK? Too often is this the case for these champs league highlights. Step up your game editors.
Insert random penalty
Terrible highlight edit. Turned a good game in this? What happened on the second Haaland goal? The world may never know.
What's with the random penalties???
He's already the best in the world. idc
Fuck sevilla players, they were mad but Bono did the same to him when he saved the fist penalty.
Terrible editing
Please, leave the foul for the penalty in!!!
Yo what is happening. 2 pens given with no highlights?
Savilla are in their the element
Haaland is a legend for that celebration 😂
I am a bvb fan and I was shaking that it wasn’t another day against Bayern
Disgusting video!!! Where is the first Holland’s penalty?! What for??? What is Sevillia’s penalty for??? Made by amateurs?
Sevilla literally lost the season in 1 week!! 💀💀
The poor Spaniards aren't used to a viking celebration. Also, wtf was this editing, CBS??
Sevilla players decided to celebrate with Halland.if you can't beat him join him.
Could you show the fouls leading to the penalty? Please.
Barca should buy Halland no matter the cost😤
Kudos for getting these highlights uploaded so quickly, but Jesus that editing is piss poor
Wait why did Haaland score the second goal then goes back to 1-0 and then 2-0....what happened that the second goal got ruled out??
what happened to Haaland's second goal?  the score went back to 1-0 and then he kicked a penalty
Welcome to the game Håland form BVB vs defenders from BVB.
I love Haaland’s energy 😂
Great game but those highlights ate fucking trash !! Hire someone else
Mbappe is better, Halland is good center forward
Reus is the key player.
1:15 that’s just terrible defending😂😂 what’s Kounde doing walking back like there’s not two of the best players in the world infront of your goal....
Haaland > Mbappe   Sorry to say it. But Mbappe better start scoring more hat tricks soon if he wants to win that golden boot
What a game
Calling off Haalands goal because he got fouled is maybe the stupidest shit I done ever seen literally was magical
Haaland is an absolute monster. Best striker instincts in my lifetime
Thanks CBS for not telling me why the goal was ruled out and where the hell the penalty came from
3:07 Diego carlos steamrolled. Haaland is not only a fine footballer, hes also dangerous.
The Dortmund keeper is good, but nobody beats Cal the Dragon
Qué susto se llevaron las gallinas! ya les andaba....
well better luck next time sevilla,  now back to europa league
Qué susto se llevaron las gallinas! ya les andaba....
They put all their efforts on the Porto Juve highlights and gave no shits about this game lol.
There is such a thing as releasing highlight videos too quickly. Why didn’t Haaland’s first goal count? Why did Dortmund get a penalty? Why did Sevilla get a penalty?
Why were sevilla players chasing Haaland to celebrate the penalty goal lmao😂😂😂
Wat if we get a bvb vs bayern finale😂🤔
CBS you guys suck with your highlights!!!
Can anyone explain why Haaland screamed at the keeper? Was a little odd
Imagine dourtmud vs psg in the final.. prob not but oh well
4:01 Sevilla cheating into the box on the penalty. If the pen is blocked it gets retaken. Sevilla constantly cheating to their own detriment.
GOD AND JESUS LOVE YOU
Hallan  is 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
Halland ego is so high like zlatan. I love it 😂😂
So much fun watching German team playing.Not like Juve and Porto where players were falling like soldiers in Stalingrad battle.
I LOOOOOVE how salty the other teams get whenever Haaland scores. They're so mad 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣
Why is there no penalty explanations?
Only if Dortmund could keep a clean sheet....Haaland seem to be a fun guy to be around.
Haaland (20) picks Reus like a child (31) lol dude is strong.
Ben Yedder has been underrated for years
No explanation of ruled out goal and no context for penalty. Please re-edit and upload again.
Haaland left foot is something else 🔥
Why does Haaland look like he is going to beat you up after scoring a goal?
Halland is phenomenal ❤️❤️❤️👑🙌🙌
why was haaland's second goal disallowed?
I’m so confused 🤷‍♂️
Haaland scored 4 goals in 2 games vs Sevilla; not bad for a 20-year old striker
Jesus do we have to get the super extended highlights to know how penalties and disallowed goals happen? Go hire someone from NBC please
Sevilla complains about everything... glad they are done for the remainder of UCL, complaining for a foul that was completely shoulder to shoulder and Haaland was the stronger player!
Why was this editing so bad... there was no explanation for anything
For anyone confused... the second was disallowed because they said Haaland fouled the defender. Imo it wasn’t a foul. They went shoulder to shoulder and Haaland is just bigger. And then when the ref was checking the video he saw a penalty he didn’t call before the disallowed goal, so he gave Haaland a penalty kick. But on the first penalty attempt the keeper came off his line, so Haaland got to take it again and scored on the second attempt.
Hey @ChampionsleagueonCBS any chance of y'all having the ability to leave the penalty kick decisions in this replay? Big thanks and much love.
Love how Halland didn’t go for the dive on that disallowed goal, but went for the finish. We need more of that in the sport.
Sevilla crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is it just me or I saw 2-0 then 1-0? Am I tripping?
Bruh how they gonna miss the goal getting dissalowed, the initial pen take
What a beautiful Header from The Morrocan Youseer Neisery . Just beautiful
His denied goal was incredible
Greatest goal scoring talent of All Time
Haarland has beaten Ronaldo's record of 17 goals in the Champions League
I have never seen highlights show penalties without the foul causing it.
WAY TO GO DORTMUND LOVE SOCCER WITH ALL MY HEART
Why wouldn’t they show us why Haaland’s goal was disallowed?? Or why either penalty was awarded?? Is there some policy that videos have to be 8 minutes or something? Terrible edit.
1:20 Literally carried him 🤣
No way that goal wasn’t legit
poor editing.... two fouls that caused the penalty kicks not shown...
Halland's second goal... FUCKEN HOG ! 😂 but sucks it was a Pen
I can't wait for Haaland vs Mbappe in the next 10 years. Both shall push each other to get better ... like Messi vs Ronaldo.
how are you going to show misses but not the fouls that led to penalties, fire this editor
Garbage highlight! Doesn’t show any of the fouls leading to penalties or the goal being ruled out....
editing is absolute trash!!
Dam mbappe gonna get free motivation from halland and score 2nd hat trick against barca tmr
Terrible video. Idk how anything in this game happened
Sevilla with a good performance despite the loss. I thought dortmund would have finished the game easy after the first leg and three losses in a row (two from Barca) before today.
Haaland to Reus: GET OVVERRRR HERERER
Didnt show the reason for either penalty.....smh
Sevilla’s keeper is the type of dude to be losing 4-0 in fut champs and celebrate after scoring 1 goal in the 85th minute
The Sevilla players just wanted to celebrate with Haaland 3:37
you need to show the foul leading to the penalty
I hate this Spanish teams. They always overreact when their opponents tries to waste time. He wasn’t even trying to waste time he was just celebrating his goal. They the one who makes the game ugly when they’ve a lead. They waste time and dive for fouls.
Watching the defense against Haaland is interesting. Are they even aware he's playing until he scores? Way too often people just stand there watching the pass and guarding no one. First and foremost make sure you know where he is.
Haaland told Bono: don’t fw me
Sevilla regretting why they haven't remained 3rd in group stages.
Why did Haaland pick up Rues like that 😂
Why aren’t they showing the fouls that caused the penalty????
Look up the TUDN highlights they're better
Haaland welcome to Bayern☺️ #MiaSanMia
marco reus was sad after his bestie lewandoski went to bayern, but he found a new scoring friend with halaand
3:44 Salty Ass Ocampos xD
Hallan goat
As a Dortmund fan, last 3 minutes of this game nearly gave  me a heart attack
Can we see why they got a penalty😐
Haaland solo empuja la pelota y listo, ya sos el mejor del mundo
Someone tag NBCSN and tell em this how u do it
Kounde and Diego Carlos got exposed so hard by haaland
I am the best in the world
A kid makes them mad lol
CBS be like, I AM SPEED. TAKE NOTES REBECCA LOSE
Im completely baffled as to why Rakitic has been bench for Sevilla’s biggest games
Halland is the new zlatan 🔥🔥🔥💯
How do you not show the VAR check for Haaland's goal, the build up to a penalty, the retake of a penalty, and the build up of another penalty?
Horrible job with the editing.
Great game but terrible editing. Haaland scores and then suddenly no he didn't but he's taking a penalty a second time???
3:38 the Sevilla players are celebrating with haaland🤯
Really entertaining game.
Very poor highlights package. Does not address Haaland's disallowed goal, skips straight to retaken penalty without mention if the proceeding drama, does not show incident for Sevilla penalty. In previous CL highlights videos we have seen every substitute ( occasionally in a row) yet this video does not include some of the main talking points of the match.
Why did Haaland taunt the keeper after that pen?
Fuck bvb  can't believe they gave up that last goal
Haaland was VERY disrespectful after scoring that pen, yeah you scored, but show some respect
Great game but why didnt rakatic start?
2 penalties without showing the fouls, plus the disallowed goal before Haaland's penalty. I watch the highlights because I can't watch the games live, please work on improving these, idc if the videos are 20 minutes if I can understand what happened 🙏
Haaland BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!
haaland stole the show again but respect en nessyri hes class
Haaland has the potential to be one of the best number 9’s of all time
Why didnt the 2nd goal counted & why was there a penalty all of a sudden? Extended highlights my ass
Fix the editing of these highlights We couldnt even see the relay of the second goal and how the penalty even happened.
So what was up with the random penalties?
Why was Halaands 2nd goal ruled out?
Show the events leading to the penalties! Appreciate the speed of upload, but why?
Get a new editor my goodnesses... do you guys not realize how bad these highlights are
Show da foul dat made da penalty dumb ahh hos
if he sign for bayern he will beat all records He should stay with Dortmund 2 or 3 more seasons
Can you guys show the foul leading up to the penalty?
3:09 halland omg 🦾
Halland, one of the luckiest players on earth BONO saved the penalty kick No idea why would VAR give Dortmund another chance I’m sure if BONO saved the 2ed time they will give Halland 3rd chance Hahahha enyssiry is good
Those two Barcelona games really broke Sevilla mentally.
Halaand is phenomenal , too different with the kids 🤫
Not gonna replay that second Harland goal?!?!?
how were the penalties won? who edits these vids?
Haaland is a bully lol ...
wtf with editing?
editing needs improvement
Haaland picking Reus up like it's nothing... 😄😄
This game was crazy if Sevilla would of shot in last minute they would of won
So you didn't include either penalty call or the first Haaland penalty that was saved? What kind of "extended" highlights is this? Ridiculous.
Sevilla always a hard team to beat. Even bayern couldn't make much of opportunities in the super cup..
Sevilla pissed over the penalty that they had to push Haaland for celebrating
Bellingham needs to calm his dumb ass down, getting mad about missed chances because he can’t shoot so he doesn’t get the ball
Who else keeps refreshing to comment on juve game and roast the gaynaldo fans 🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Looks like neither team knows how to pass out of the back
I appreciate how quick the highlights get posted but its not worth it if they are this terrible.  No VAR, no penalty explanation, nothing????  Take 10 extra minutes and put some thought into it.
What was up with haalands celebration? It seemed like he was mocking the keeper for some reason
Who tf made this guy? Samsung?
I am a defender but if I went against Halland I would be scared 😱. My guy keeps make crazy runs that worries  defenders. He is also very patient, calm ,smart,  and fast 💨 and strong
they call it extended highlights yet leave out a bunch of important moments, I was so confused watching this lol
Lol sevilla always wins the europa league pretty easily yet in the champions league they always loose. LMAO.
This may the worst put together highlights of a game ever.  actual shit at telling the story of the game... dont show the VAR checks?? the first penalty?? dumbasses
lousy coverage
Now just imagine if Sancho were in linking up with Haaland, this could have been 4 or 5  ...
Halland is whatever overhyped.
Why was the 2nd goal disallowed? Before the PK
Can’t wait to have Halland in Barcelona VISCA BARCA❤️💙
Wow, CBS is way better than Fox Sports and Bleacher Channel with Champions league upload videos   This is fast. Thanks
Sevilla players wanted to celebrate with Haaland🤣
CBS should be embarrassed by this edit.  It's possible to tell the story of the game, even with highlights.  They failed to do that.  What's with the goal that wasn't a goal, then a penalty kick for no apparent reason?  What's with Sevilla's penalty kick at 67:46?
This video should've been at least 10 mins longer, that bizarre penalty given to Dortmund needed some explanation. I saw the game and I was like what the fuck is happening with VAR
Someone celebrates a goal in your goalies face like Halaand 😂 wyd ?
E.H is just so damn. Good. The guy makes it looks so easy. Hes a goal scoring machine, but his quality of goals dont even come close to likes of messi
official match highlights and you cant even show us the fouls that led to the penalties..
Why don't they show the fouls the lead to the PKs?
Calls off a goal to award a PEN to the GOAL SCORER??? Holy shit man
Erling GOALand
They messed up with highlights but for people who didn't watch the game, Dortmund's second goal was called out by ref but then given a penalty. Haaland missed the penalty but then the ref gave another penalty for the goalie being over the line.
These highlights are fucked....tons of missing plays.  Doesnt show Haalands goal disallowed, doesnt show the penalty committed, doesnt show first penalty shot, doesnt show goalkeeper off line, doesnt show sevilla penalty..
What kind of highlight is this. Not sure how and how goal was canceled and its directly to penalty. Lazy  work
Happy to see the highlights early, but I wish it showed what the foul was that created a penalty
Why was the second goal called off?
When Rakitic's assist is better than the goal🥶
Can you show how the penalties happened lmao
ty u for upload. editing can be a little better
Haaland is just a juggernaut.
Why does it feel like the team doesn’t really like Halland?
credit for FAST upload, but have to admit, it is a bit messed up with the random penalties...
I freaking love watching Haaland.
Why did you guys edit out the context to the penalty and things like that. Really bad highlight reel
Sevilla’s keeper taunting Haaland after saving the pen  Just to get taunted by Haaland after scoring the retake 😂👏🏽
Haaland picking up Reus like a toddler lmao
CBS need to show us why goals are disallowed
Absolutely abysmal editing
Why are there no clips of the action that led the the penalties? Haaland is too good for Dortmund.
Very bad use of VAR from the referees as a neutral viewer seemed clear as day that it favored Dortmund heavily
These highlights were trash. Why did each team get the penalty?
Horrible highlights. You don’t show the 1st penalty haalland got & how each penalty happened.
Who’s here after the live Juventus game lol
Juventus knocked out by Porto 😒
You can see how much Dortmund rely on Haaland
It goo to see a team like Dortmund finally back in the quarterfinals
I can't believe it! We made it to the Quarter Finals!!! Awesome performance for BVB!!!🖤💛🖤💛
Is my grandpa editing these highlights for y’all, terrible storytelling.
Haaland's celebration are the funniest!! he lift Marco like he was nothing Lol
The moment Juve sign CR7, they keep on declining. Ig that what happen when you pass the ball to cr7 and expect him to score every single time.
Great match.  Sevilla never gave up in this match.. props for that.
Just watched the highlights, didn't watch the game. Why did the second goal get disallowed?
Haaland is too good
Haaland 👏🏽
this shitty club Sevilla is who everyone was praising Barka for making a comeback against 😂😂😂couldn't even beat farmers Dortmund
Haaland is just unstoppable he has to be a Ballon dor contender
Why don’t we get to see what causes the penalties???
idc in 2021 haaland is better than ronaldo
20 goals in 14 CL games so far. And this kid is just beginning to warm up!!! No tattoos, no dyed hair, no entourages, no distractions off the field. All this kid knows is how to play football. 30 years ago it used to be enough. Even today it is enough.
What’s with the random penalties? 🤨The highlights don’t show what caused them
Dortmund’s attack: 🦁 Dortmund’s defense: 🐱
The two games today we're crazy
Nice edits, wtf happened during 2nd goal????
Ya’ll posted the highlights quick lol
These highlights are terrible. Why did Sevilla get a pk? Why did BVB get one? Why did Haalands goal not count? Did he shoot 2 pks? Who the fuck is clipping these? Get fired
did you see him make that Lewandowski like movement before the Pen ?! This dude is watching Lewa alright
This shows Haaland is a beast. Just picks up Reus like a piece of bread.. 😂😂😂
😁
What a piss poor job editing the highlights. No explanation on the goal ruled out, no var on the pen, no show of the foul.
Thank you God for champions league
What crazy matches we got today.
Great goal for erling HAALand. 🖤💛
Haaland is a goal machine. And that's fact
Halaand is a machine.. real city utd barca should pay for this kid....
Did Sevilla really go: "It wasn't a goal, it was a penalty!" ?
*THE CHAMPIOONS*
dortmund doesn't like winning things easily.
In before Juventus lose       To Porto🤣🤣🤣
The sevilla goalkeeper deserved it for talking trash to haaland
Niceeeeeee en syryyyyyyyy
Man, taunting has become quite common in football.
Haaland scores  Gets ruled back Penalty Penalty saved Retaken bc the keeper was off his line Penalty scored   *breathe*
Some questionable decisions, but a good game overall. Good effort from both sides.
The only real good youtube channel for UCL
Whats this commentators name again?
What were they thinking in VAR? What a mess.
What a game
Great game from Haaland. Would be great if he can reach the 100 UCL goals mark and maybe even surpass Ronaldo and Messi’s tally after they retire. Great talent.
At this rate, if Dortmund go far in the champions league, Haaland might break Cr7’s record for most goals in a champions league season
Ok
The way Haaland picked up Reus😂
Haaland is simply unstoppable 🔥
Haaland is built different!
There’s is levels  between eliminating the Europa league champions vs destroying a weak Barcelona
Haaland 🔥🔥🔥
Erling Haland is just a steam locomative x10000
I'm still watching the Juventus vs. Porto game😂😂.
Better match than the Juve vs Porto
it’s really good to see a team like Dortmund finally back in the quarterfinals
Halaand has the potential to become the best striker ever
fairplay to Sevilla they never gave up and fought to the very end. Haaland is so good man
It's nice how these highlights arent posted 3 hours after the game
Last
Anyone watching the Juventus v. Porto game rn?
9th
Haaland is the quickest player of all time to get 20 ucl goals. that’s just crazy
Second
🔥🔥
Second
Damm that was fast
HAAAALAAAAND!!!!!!!
Dourtmund or man city winning it
Congrats to Dortmund
First
