Bro I am in 2025 and Nicros nickname is diddy lol
Pov  logan paul 2:17
Is it bad that nicro’s voice makes me want to blow my nose?
24:39 I mean, palm trees are monocots, so in a way she’s not wrong
20:00 Ahh yess. By the snow. How helpful
these used to be so fun
I love binging these edited videos of everyone's perspectives. Bless all the editors ❤🥰
seeing nicro's tag is uh. a little different now
29:27 thats crazy he predicted squid games season 2
1:01 this whole thing killed me 😂 9:18 that gasp  10:39 “Pokémon” 💀 12:39 Ah… 25:00 And indeed it was 29:06 that whole thing was amazing
The way crafty clutched
2:15 Logan Paul:
8:29 "ANOTHER SEASIDE MOON?! STOP!"
Hi alpharad
1:18 u committed them to memory you son of a WOOHOO 😂
13:16 ummm cj?
I love how nicro had Diddy in parenthesis years before the allegations (well technically not since they true) started
12:07 12:07 12:08 12:08 12:08 12:08 12:09 12:13 12:13 12:13 12:14 12:14 12:14 12:14 12:14 12:14 12:15 12:15 12:15 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:16 12:17 12:17 12:17 12:17 12:18 12:18 12:18 12:18 12:18 12:18 12:19 12:19 12:19 12:19 12:19 12:20 12:20 12:20 12:20 12:21 12:21 12:21 12:23 12:23 12:24 12:24 12:25 12:25 12:25 12:26 12:27 12:28 12:29 12:30 12:31 12:31 12:31 12:32 12:32 12:32 12:32 12:32 12:33 12:33 12:33 12:33 12:33
Mario tag but captures only is a really interesting concept 😂
25:25 He saw a WHAT?
Alpharad… ah fu-
somebody in CJs Chat at the start said "Is Alpha Luffy?"
11:49 OMNISCIENT READER MENTIONED!!! ORV! ORV! There is no LA in Ba Sing Se
I enjoyed this video a lot, but I was really disappointed when I found out Smant lost.
Fir is a masterbaiter
2:17 Logan Paul be like
in 2025 seeing Nicro being called "Diddy" (on the side of the screen) is wild
20:53
Im too late haha.
Nicro being Diddy aged well 💀
I always forget that close to the start of the game Alpharad grinded speedruns until he got a top 10 time
Nicro did not need Diddy😭😭😭
3 years later these are still peak
22:47 I really wonder how much longer Crafty would have lasted if he just stayed. That spot is wierdly amazing
Nicro is diddy before diddy
25:28 WHAT DID HE SAY?!?!?!
Nicro:Diddy
AHH SHI- Cjya 2025 8:35
@smallant love ur vids
giving out other ppls spots cus ur about to get caught is just sore loser behavior
The fanart was fire🔥🔥🔥
These Days I wouldnt put diddy next to nicros name
Bro💀
“He’s by the snow!” -best information in snow kingdom
Alpharad one piece reference
Nico(diddy) ?? Anyone else see thats
Is anyone gonna say how nicro has diddy by his name?
Nicro (diddy) well that aged well
this is the best like to dislike ratio i've ever seen
Nicro as Diddy be wildin' tho 💀💀💀💀
People seeing in 2025, nicros name 💀
tbh this is the only time I heard Crafty sweared. AFter 2 years!!!
2:16 -Logan Paul, random forest in Japan, 2017.
Nicro being called “diddy” ages so well
Has no one noticed That’s Nicro has (Diddy)😂
Anyone else see Fir as a younger looking Alpha with the similar hair?
13:12 "He finally actually went inside me" out of context would be wild
i know this is old but one of them is using TextNow, i hear the chime and its just quiet enough to think its my phone in the other room
Everyone: 🗣️ Crafty all the time:🤐
I just think it’s funny how nobody is mentioning how cj just pointed at fir in snow 😂😂😂
nicro is diddy
why is nicro diddy
I tried the glitch and you can actually fall out of the water column and it will still work.
Wait is that jaiden animations best friend????
2:16 logan paul reference
29:18 I’VE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE!!! I SAID I PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE
Where it all began
Pov: Logan paul in 2017 2:15
HOW CAN YOI SEE THAT 2:17
I think this is the real squid game
1:58 Nicros chat says “hello my s*xy Mario 💀
5:19  Alpharad with the false info!
Around 10:12 The Great Nicro Escape is hilarious.
Anyone in 2025
“I was definitely inside you” 💀
2:16 sounded like logan Paul for a sec there
These were the days
Should have a race with discussions and who wins get 10 subs
removing Kong from Diddy Kong didn't work out well in under 2 years.
Jacob thinking he was juking people is funny to see his smile.
“He’s right ther- I’m pointing like your gonna see that” 😂😂😂
The fact that nicro was juking people in the gushin for nearly 10 mins is crazy
I Love Smallant❤❤❤
Vern nation decimation!
2:17 "I think there's someone hanging right there"
7:17 Crafty and Cjs frantic “He is!” 7:38  Poo: he’s going for the!.. I dunno what he’s doing man 😂
I love how the name next to nicro is diddy, bro knew💀
Small ant sold the whole thing when he left the  *”water shooter”*
5:04 Come out bro they found us
Nikro is what?
2:17 Logan Paul
2:17 BRO.
In snow kingdom smant somehow lost a second he was at 30:40 and then was suddenly at 30:39
I watched this video many times since it was released and only now realized that in 3:13 they are talking about being an auctioneer and Jacob is doing an impression of an auctioneer
Oh are we getting him a YouTube video…… maybe got me dieing
16:12  snew kingdom my beloovd
Kinda funny that on the side, nicro  is labeled Diddy.💀💀💀
Nicro and Smat are the best hiders, both of them got the whole party locked in on them.
Fucyuo 😮l😢😢😢😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hire and seek in the forest/flower kingdom would be insane with the dino and stuff
Nicro being diddy did NOT age well         i know that its diddy kong
Red Bull are donzo next F1 season. Max can go dump it into the gravel I swear
Nicro’s name was “nicro (diddy)
12:01 🤨
9:52 "thems the breaks, pal, thems the breaks"  "shadow... shadow youre an asshole man"  "you are what you eat sonic"
6:39 Alpharad’s face- 😅
"Fir maybe baiting me but he is a master at that" Smallant 2022 bro is not slick
super mario odyssey gushen police chase
Nicro named diddy 😭
Why is nicro diddy 😂
You forgot to hide out bands
THIS DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT WAS MADE TWO YEARS AGO
Crafty the underdog
6:44 dematerialises
Nicros little discord name aged so poorly 💀
Jesus loves you all, a relationship with God is the solution to having joy and peace in the midst of the suffering and chaos in this world <3
12:01 woah😮
This video is how I discovered Alpharad and now he’s my favorite YouTuber
12:51 I'm nascaring the shit out if you!
I miss Nicro palying I'm realizing watching these videos back. Not to mention Lycel and a few others that arent in this video like Katie. We need an OG crew game soon!
Yo nicro had the funniest parts by far 😂
Fir made a joke 😂😂😂 15:09
I like how Alpha is friends with everyone I love 😭‼️
I have no idea who they are. Is her name Lysol or am I high?
I like when they use Mario sounds when they curse lol😅
Smant is gaming. Fir is being the best kind of obnoxious. Lycel, Pooh, and Crafty are just vibing. Nicro and CJ are giving little brother energy. Meanwhile Jacob is lightly dissociating
Go small ant
12:40  I could feel the pain in alpharad's voice
whz smallant evrz time wins
20:01 “His by the snow” 😂
Me watching this for like the 7th time but I always and up laughing 😂😂
Alpha wins best dressed. 🏴‍☠
Im only here for the family friendly coverup
Smallant you are a crazy man 💀
BigBSnorlax Just cursed the f word randomly
Son of a wahoo!
Cj is so funny shouting “GET HIS ASS”😂
I love The Great Gushin Chase, gushins probably still give these peeps ptsd
they all say im skibidi.. but im actually skibidepressed........
Hide and seek? Nah this is just, seek ant
The huuuge gushin chase demonstrated some of the most amazing drifting movement I’ve ever seen those jukes were IMMACULATE
25:25 Alphared uses his obligatory N Word Pass.
Sin is essentially disobedience from God. God created order in this world, and when He created Humans, He gave us free will (since He is Good + knows that we should willingly follow Him out of our own decision— without force) ! We disobeyed/strayed from His loving way of life, and we all have this problem of sin. Our sin has a punishment though.   Because God is Good, He is Just. Because God is Just, He— a Judge— cannot let us — a Guilty Criminal that has Disobeyed the Law— set free legally due to our problem of sin. Therefore, we must be sent to hell— endless punishment and torment— (like how A criminal goes to jail) for our sin.  Now… the thing is, hell is a scary place and I definitely do not want to go there. (It isn’t a party down there— If a Judge sent a criminal to jail and if jail is a party, then would the criminal really be paying the price for their crime? NO. It’s the same with Hell!)   HERE IS THE GOOD NEWS (THE GOSPEL) GOD SENT HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, JESUS TO DIE ON THE CROSS FOR OUR SIN, ESSENTIALLY SERVING AS BAIL BY TAKING OUR PLACE/PUNISHMENT OF SIN ON THE CROSS UPON HIMSELF. (HE COULD ONLY DO THIS BECAUSE HE LIVED A PERFECT LIFE WITHOUT SIN)  SO BECAUSE OF HIS SACRIFICE, WE CAN BE SAVED FROM HAVING TO GO TO HELL, AND INSTEAD GO TO HEAVEN IF WE JUST BELIEVE WHAT HE DID FOR US(THE GOSPEL) —die for our sins— AND REPENT(which means turn away from Sin).   Now, like a criminal Can be bailed out from jail legally, JESUS BAILS US OUT OF HELL SO WE CAN GO TO HEAVEN AND SPEND ETERNITY WITH HIM! 🙂   JESUS LOVES YOU, HE’S CALLING YOU ALL HOME! <33 John 3:16
The fact that a add showed up right when I got to this video and it’s said :fly me to the moon movie😂😂
The fact that Nicro’s outfit description is diddy
SmallAnt should NOT have told them how to stay in the water shooter! How he lost his ultimate spot!
"are we giving him a youtube video?" LOL
😢
XXXXXXXXDDDDDDDDDD
At 19:57 "hes by the snow"
Fir baited he’s a master at that.
I love how this is smallants video but he barely talks-
20:02 really I though he was by the lava
CJ getting 5 16 is crazy
Does anyone have a sponsorblock config that can skip past any mention of Alpha***?
fir is the best for me
just once more, i have to watch it ONE MORE TIME (ive watched it like 20 times already)
poor Lycel on crazy aus lag
Prompts to the editor (Mike) for editing 8 WHOLE SEPERATE STREAMS seamlessly
How to time？
How come there are so many people in this game?
"alpharad's costume blends in so well up there" *zooms in to where alpharad ISNT and puts alpharad offscreen* it took me 12 rewatches to find him and i gave up. 5 minutes later it shows alpha in a completely offscreen area during the zoom-in
I love how fir has that same smirk the whole time no matter what😂
13:05 is my favorite part of this video, this whole squid race and nicro just being so chill is so funny And then he just goes like “*GASP* he got me.”
Did anyone else see that someone called Nicro sexy mario in his chat at 1:52?
This comment will not have 1,000 likes
love these guys
love this guys
The collab we didn’t know we 100% needed
Smallant sabotaging alpha and the other girl in the first round really pissed me off
Alpha literally had such a good hiding spot 1st round I wish he would've knew that it appears as closed on everyone else's screen😭
Alpha vs CJ vs Crafty vs fir vs POO vs Lycel vs Nicro vs Smallant
Can smant make a video of hide and seek in botw or totk
Ppl who love smallant
yo
“You finally actually came inside me”
"He's by the snow" had me dying for 5 minutes
"he's doing the backwards any percent movement" what the hell are those callouts🤣🤣🤣
A point system would be better.
This may be a big project, but I would love to see you attempt a Mega Build. It's a big challange but I think you could do it.
16:40 small ant calling him a master baiter
Craftys voice is so satisfying idk y
I'm excited for this to be apart of future kids childhood memories
I liked my own comment😊
Alpharad
Did Alpharetta say negro in lost kingdom klepto sub???
22:15 lmao
Logan Paul in 2018: 2:16
Good times
My heart DROPPED when I heard Nicro was in it  (For those who don’t understand, Nicro was the first person to complete Mario Odyssey within less than an hour)
1:35, who’s go going tell her that most good spots are the most dumb ones.
The one piece  is real
ive watched this video 4 times, great video
10:35 to 13:25 is just Gushens chasing each other lol
He’s by the snow, in the snow kingdom
1:13 “You committed them to memory you son of a-“  Well you recognized them and knew what and where and how he would know, meaning you probably memorized them too, didn’t you?
Can I be I a vid i got 685 Moons
10:12 remove all context. Like if this was said 50 years ago, it’s such a gross thing that a kid would say, and that’s got me in stitches 😂
Allow paintings for a game
Hi smallant do you want to make a  other hide and seek video?
Honestly the comedic timing of  "Hey Alpharad." "What?" *dies* "Ah." Is perfect
My fav YouTuber
Crafty hides 1 second or 10 minutes.there is no in between
Sad there hasn't been many of these in a year... 😢
This is the most BETA group of content creators I have ever seen
what is this mod?
Hi
Smant goated
alpharad is a loser
Nooooo smallant
Alpharad: chat they will never look at the lighthouse. *Meanwhile fir about to get him*
At 1:34 Lycel sounds like poo
Crafty is literally so cool. Not only did he make this mod and therefore made these videos possible, he’s really funny and really fun to watch play high and seek. All hail Crafty Boss 🙏
The fact katie commented on 18:04
its so sad that smant isnt friends with cjs bc he didnt want to say any slurs
Oda
20:56  I’m going no I’m not going I’m going
Yahdah Yahuah Yahusha
I like how fir just doesn’t care while chasing small ant in moon
"Are we giving him a youtube video?" "Maybe"
7:30 that’s how you know that player is good at speed running
Smallant is a korok, you find him in a obscure part and then he disappears to somewhere else.
“It’s not a tree in a traditional way.” lol
Imma be honest she's really cute
This is the biggest game of gaslighting ever
Danny calling Lycel Lickel is funny
when alpha got found in seaside it was raining firs
The Lapras shiny is purple not yellow
My final video before the holidays end and I go back to school
"fun fact: the rocket flowers are faster than the gushin" 🤓
Nicro really playing run and seek
i really want to play smo hide and seek. it looks so fun
I think I just found my new fav yter to watch
“Oh you committed them to memory you son of a- *WAHOO* “
Just look by the snow to find Nicro
I would’ve hidden in the Bound Bowl waiting room
jacob was in spectator mode
Could you just hide in the odyssey?
How dud crafty make this insane mod😊😊😊😊😊😊
These thumbnails lookin like Smash Bros challenge pictures
Smant is the master of deception
“The orb that’s in front of you is the orb that your chasing” small ant 2022
hi
I love that smallant is shrouded in shadow this whole video. He looks like an H.P. Lovecraft character
2:16 smant sounding a little reminiscent of another certain youtuber
Cjya when he finds fir: YES YES YES YES YES YES *emotes* Cjya when he finds crafty: ok its confirmed i found crafty
It says fir(AMERICAN) and that’s just so funny to me. It’s like the description for the character select I am video gamw
These people right here are my favorite Hide-n-Seek players :)
Smant is probably the best player here, but isn’t the best speedrunner. Wow.
"I could be baiting you" -Fir "He is a Master at that" -Smant Cannot believe Lycel was the only one who got that joke, mad underrated
O
Gamers don't look up ☺
25:26 he saw A WHAT?
Crafty is just better
Ant is the 5 second Mario odyssey race you
I really love your videos and I'd really like to be in one
Is it just me or when cjay yells he sounds like Barry b benson, I cant unhear it help
the 6:22 crafty face haha
pou is ugly
Vj
Cj
25:26
Alpha’s look of realization 13:59
OH MY GOD ARE WE GIVING HIM A YOUTUBE VIDEO… maybe
Crafty needs to make freeze tag
I am the luckiest person in the world. I saw this video right by cj’s video on this
How to play with 8 people?
🫢🤗
he saw a what
i didnt realise till i watched this again that alpharad is Monkey D. Luffy
do one of these agaain
Hey
There are best friends now
Yall just created squid tag. Lol
Hi small and I’m your new sub ceep up the good work
7:27
They say "i was inside you!" so many times sus?"
1:00 why did you not hide under the boss fight in moon cave you did it one time already
Lycel: which means it's a good spot or it's fucking dumb  Me: Isn't that every possible spot in existence?
This is the best seaSide I’ve seen   Also Congrats crafty for single-handedly making this mod
Alpharad Did a One Piece Reference
This is the best hide and seek video
GO CRAFTY!!!!!! LES GO
10:33 and the race begins
Logan Paul at 2:17
25:24
Okay, so how is Lycel's name supposed to be pronounced? Coz various people are saying "lai-kel" and "lai-sel" and "lick-el", so I have no idea. XD
i just watched the speed video now this all feels slow
Dude Nicro is actually 100% baked
im ok at the game
i wanna try
It's so cool for me that all these creators collaborated together, especially smart and alpharad
Bro GPed alpharad so hard an ad came on
5:36 what were those two blocks i don't play so i was confused
Lycel is so hot
“Ahhh”-Alfarad as he died
whats jappening?
Nicro's sentence at 29:05 lives in my head rent-free
Crafty can be a idiot at sum times
love this game pls put more hide and seek videos and more mods
“He is by the snow”…wow
P
10:48 mario squid racing looks so funny
lol I love Nicro
Solution: invisible cap
You son of a b woo hooo 1:16 XD
craftyboss can you get me the mod please
10:24 - 13:09 Enjoy the gushen chase!!!
The fact that Nicro managed to flee from the seekers for 7 minutes without ever hiding in a new spot is still amazing
12:38 favorite part 14:18 6:21 7:15 4:13 14:42 10:34 2:46 23:32 17:57 18:44  17:09 2:27 4:36 20:20 17:52 22:17 27:48 1:01
Imagine hiding as a snow kingdom native and acting like an npc
Alpha carried
I'm sitting here, 7:50am waiting for my first call with coworkers of the day, and watching this video, and realising these 8 people are working. playing mario odyssey and having fun is work for them. not fair.
Me thinking for like 10 mins alpha said the big n word at 25:26
fish clip
The Mario sounds used as censors was really funny to me lol
"you were inside me"
Smant snitching on others just for the victory is why i always  wish he looses cause he is such a traitorous tryhard XD
Fir keeps getting found ‘Fir’st ool
When poo gets caught is snow kingdom, it tryies to bleep it out but it bleeps it at the wrong time and it still says the cuss word
If they had mars it would be complete
Would love to more of these videos
1:37 I don't feel comfortable hearing a young child use profanity. It doesn't sound good
Petition for Crafty to add the squids to every kingdom and make squid race a real mod
14:00 I like how alpharad knows Smallants evil plan
everyone saying "hes inside me"
Is it just me or does Cj at parts sound like Barry b benson from the bee movie
Anyone else hear the change in accent when Lycel said “I need to pee”?
How do you get That mod
How do youget Thatcher mod
How did you even get alpharad invited?
I have a stupid idea. maybe you could do smo hide and seek, but throughout several kingdoms. there'd have to be a ton of seekers though to make up for how large it is. it would take forever but it might be fun
Y'all gotta make squid tag a game lol
I love your vids and because of you, I got Super Mario Odyssey for my Nintendo Switch.
How'd u get all yall in the same game
Fir: "Alpharad."  Alpha: "What?" *Gets ground pounded* Alpha: "Ah."
Hide
Literally hid out of bounds that is the way to win
25:26 what did he say?????
It cant be a hide and seek video withought the smallant chase
Any video with Lycel in it,  just makes it a little bit better..
14:42 "Is he that cheap chief? Is he the cheap sheep? No I'm the cheap jeep." Best captions ever.
"it's ok I'm also very close to winning"
I’m so dirty minded I can’t listen to this without laughing 😂 I’m sorry😅😂😂😂😂
13:02 Squid games anyone?       (Yes, I hate myself)
Lol cj’s final time 😂😂
Love how the Dooplis theme was perfect here
Smant's lies and deception are the best parts of these vids. It's great because he just feeds them exactly what they're expecting to hear.
I feel like alpharad did a one piece reference
Can I be a new video please small end please
That was not squid race but it actualy was squid tag
Can I play  LOL
the amount of ads. oh my god
I love your vids. Because  of you, i got Super Mario Odyssey on my Nintendo Switch, for my birthday, which was 3 days ago.
0:56 interesting chat...
How do you do 8 person Mario?
super video
Coming off the get faster with every moon this feels very slow
6:44  is amazing
They should have a galactic Hide and seek where anyone can hide in any kingdom it'd be super long but really fun
i like how during the intro, everyone had their face on screen except Crafty Crafty is just an entity with no physical form outside of Mario
Squid Race is the best game ever That Nicro chase was so long
10:48-13:13 (the great squid race 😂)
"are we giving him a youtube video?" "...maybe"
Why did he sound like Barry B Benson in distress at 11:12 like it sounds like when Barry screams VANESSA  Edit: and at 13:29
Can you make a video soon that is not on small any gods and is on the main channel?
Do  more hide and seek
Nicro’s chat is so wild in this video.
Smant you COWARD selling out your team mate like that smh
I just love these types of vids, Smallant, you did GOOD! 😁
I haven't had this much fun watching a video in years.
Next should do 16 players :)
nicro running in the gusheon deserves a montage with the benny hill theme
13:12 Heh...
the censored sounds are soo funny
When can I play tag
19:57 “he’s by the snow”💀
20:20 "I'm pointing like you're gonna see that", to be honest Cj, I'd probably do the exact same thing
In sand kingdom inverted pyramid for the loading zone to get to the top of it you can go fully inside it without teleporting
Ew shut the woman up
“Alpharad” “What” *gets ground pounded* “Ah”
Man Hes cheatin 26:50
vợ chồng hạnh phúc .Đúng là an cư mới lập nghiệp .Đúng rồi làm youtube không dễ ăn như mọi ngườ nghĩ. Chúc 2 em sức khỏe và thành công trong sự nghiệp.
Algún día yo también haré esto
The YouTube Games Location Thinks It Is Released In October of 2018. No, Not a mistake. It actually says think. I hope you read this Smallant.
Nicro’s name in brackets is a bit wrong in retrospect
I think the best tactic for seaside kingdom is to pretend to b a cheepcheep, change my mind
Id just be on the ship lol
How do u get the mod???
Alpha is gold .D Rodger lol
Fir needs to always tell where evryone is
wait you should do multi player prop hunt hide and seek
8:27 Apple Bottom Jeans! Poo, with the Fir!
26:30 🧐
Small ant can you speed run super Mario color splash for the Wii U if u don’t see this or don’t decide to do it it’s ok with me just a suggestion
that must have been so exhausting
Haven't they ever thought about going inside the oddesy right when they leave
why is smant cracked
20:00 - 20:01  Alpharad: Hes by the snow  Me: oh really theres snow on this map
Did not expect mr. Rad of the alpha to be here
I'm getting the vbucks now
Is that intro supposed to be a abbey road reference
you should do more of these with alpharad
alpharad with the weep one piece rep. you love to see it.
Where were you during the great orb chase of 22
Why does no one hide in a sphinx place
12:41 mario kart battle mode be like:  Edit: crafty sounds like nicobbq a bit
Timestamps 0:23  Round 1 moon Kingdom 8:35  Round 2 seaside Kingdom  16:16 Round 3 snow kingdom 24:21 Round (final) 4 lost Kingdom
There’s a thing I saw in another hide and seek mod (64 ex co-op for PC has a hide and seek mod already in it) that allows you to go anywhere in the game, but the seekers can check to see which painting they’re in. Maybe Crafty could do that for kingdoms. I’d love to watch a cross kingdom hide and seek game… just a thought lol
best vid of 2020 incredibly funny and amazing to think streamers are still playing a 2017 Mario game is really rare to find.
I want more gusheen tag 12:54
Hilarious I think you should do this more often
Only person missing is Failboat  I think he’d make a good addition to the cast lol
Is there a way to block  this shit? Lol
Lol seriously do u guys have nothing better to do? Because of ppl like u children have no dreams anymore 😅🤮
10:33 Need For Squid
How do u do multiplayer
"I'm NASCAR-in' the shit out of you!"
Ant
Small-Anthony
linkin park
"are we giving him a youtube video"  HMMMM  idk
20:38 AAAAh ... Ooooh
8:19 "Lick"el,
smanthony
SmallAnt was in MAYBE 15% of the video
You can do multiplayer
It’s just the shadow tho x2
the fan art tho…
Algorith gang
Alpharad should’ve stayed in the chest cause on everyone else’s screen the chest was closed
"Okay I got this. Check this out." dies
Goofy ahh mario.
2:14 that's a man bruh 💀
God spot in cascade kingdom get the t rex and  bust some rocks and hide in them!
there never going to look at the lighthouse, proceeds to die
Whoever that was at 24:35 You gave me a heart attack
i didn’t know about multiplayer until yesterday
I just love the interaction of: Cjya: GET HIS ASS! Smant: I will escape.  Cjya: you will not
GrandPooBear dies:   Crafty: I shouldn't have skipped breakfast
if youre seen youre found, dont think these ppl know what hide n seek is xD
You guys should play sardines - backwards hide and seek. All players except for one start as seekers. Give the one hider time to hide, and then as the seekers find the hider, they hide with them. It’s super fun and would still use the mechanics of hide and seek.
It’s so funny how their doing hide and seek and then all of a sudden Nicro just starts a whole new game of tag with the lava bubbles and the octopus water bubbles lol.
I would've died laughing if I saw the squid chase just like smaant did.
10:24 race thing
22:20 Idk why this made me laugh-
props to the person that has to edit 8 different hour-long streams together to make a cohesive and entertaining video.
Niceeee
Squid games
I did the impossible on moon kingdom
Here's an idea: Go to the store as a hider and put on the Invisibility Cap.
Nobody needs the Dream face reveal anymore. We need the CraftyBoss face reveal.
please get tyrone to play this :)
"He's by the snow" got me
hide n seek but in any kingdom in the game no sub areas
can we get super mario odyssey multiplayer yet or no?
Crafty is god because of this mod
13:54   Oh shHEE HEE-
Nicro made this so funny 😂
how i donwload it?
14:02 is peak awareness. Closest analogy to a 4th wall break for a live stream
As soon as Ant started doing the 2d jump in an act of desperation, GPB donned an absolutely *devilish* grin
Hehe
New mini game! GUSHIN RACERS
Gg
They should totally do a seven seeker one hider,
They should totally do a seven seeker one hider, But that one hider can hide across all kingdoms
Day one of asking nicro to make an onlyfans
Imagine a real life or VR version this where top of the line athletes played hide & seek with these kinds of crazy jumps mixed in
As soon as alpharad died I got an ad
Man you’re my favorite.
Welcome back to: Wheel of Mario!
And to think, Nintendo just added a same screen floating hat as "multiplayer" hahahahaha
More
Does anybody have any recommendations for playing hide and seek in a similar game that doesnt require crafty level mod strats??    Im just looking for levels that would provide for fun chasing antics, not the horror genre hide and seek games that already exist.
Crafty got a blowie jay
I’m always smiling so hard while watching these videos that my cheekbones are in sheer pain by the time the video is over
“Fur might be baiting me, but he is a master of that”  You could say he’s a *masterba-* *The rest of this joke was cut off to avoid violating the YouTube Community Guidelines*
16:50 yes he truly was a master baiter
When that kid says “u guys wanna play super mario oddessy together”
Don’t use captions at 25:28 😱
1:26 Pft the Mario noise to censor Lycel. 5:02 Alpharad messing with the hunters to help SmallAnt is friendship goals. 11:00 Heh SmallAnt just gets to watch the whole show. 17:08 That fanart is so cool!
Love how everyone's facecams were used in a grid at the start but none could be used cus poor Crafty doesn't have one lmao.
Idea, one hider who can go to every kingdom, 8 seekers, person who last longest wins
I love how the bleeps are Mario wehee’s
i want the link to this
do that again  but with 15 people
When is this getting released to the public? The game i mean
please continue with this until you have been in all kingdoms
You know what would be fun? an smo among us mod.
"he's by the snow"
HYPE
Hi
"He's by the snow" Me: Which?
i play trackmania and during the great gushin race of 2022 those were nonoptimal racing lines
This is a mod, right?
"Bro i got lysol"
8 grown adults screaming for 30 minutes
holy shit the amount of editing that must have had to have been done switching to whoever's stream anytime they say anything. watching the other creators videos and how they did it makes me truly appreciate the editing on this one.
everything is better with the theme of super mario 64 slider race
Stupid question, but is the Odyssey off limits? I was thinking that hiding on top and dropping down through the secret entrance as soon as they leave might be a good idea. It doesn't leave a ton of escape options though
I have watched this man's Super Mario Odessy videos ever since 2019
Is it still worth to buy Mario odyssey? And all those adjustments to the game like Smant plays sometimes, can I play those too?
Everyone is here!
i realised, i own the same water bottle as cj
I think in Odessey2 Nintendo should just add online multiplayer with different Mario characters
Small ant please can I be in a Super Mario Odyssey hide and seek video with you.
Great!😍
Hey Smant I got a new challenge idea for you.  Beat super mario odyssey with a guitar hero controller. And Beat super mario odyssey with donkey kong bongos :3
I haven't played a new Mario game since Mario 64, but these goofy videos inspired me to go out to EB games and grab a copy of Odyssey..  After bumbling about with the controls it really makes the movements in these vids that much more impressive.
CJ lol
14:05 "maybe 😀"
how do you do that
“I dale jr’d you”
this is so confusing lol i dont know whos who it switches so muchhhhhhhhh @_@
16:21 that’s what she said
I'm above average impressed by this mod, holy heck that's smooth
I have zero idea what's happening
Idea. Everyone dresses the same except the seeker. The goal is to find a specific player. If you catch a player that is not correct they join you on the hunt for the correct one.
The fact that you don't already ahve a wiki page abt you is crazy
11:00 this entire sequence, followed by alpharad just sitting on the thing watching it all is hilarious
10:34 A new game was born
telling everyone where you are right away is not helping you win these ones
They should totally do the game Sardines, where one player hides and the rest are seekers. When a seeker finds the hider they quietly hide in that spot too, until there is only one seeker left
The hole time during the gushen race I was just thinking “are hiders not aloud to use captures 🤔”
how do you get this mod?
Super Mario Odyssey but you can’t stop walking forward?
gamers don't look up
Do the same thing but with really small marios
Alpharad: oh my god are we giving him a youtube video again? Us watching youtube: yEs
Cjya sounds like he could be Barry from be movie here 11:46
if this mod ever got released to the public it would be really great, but i have no friends who own mario odyssey
Lycel getting killed while peeing was so much funnier than I was expecting. The empty room 😭
How did you get 8 players
The editing is fantastic. 27:20 had me cackling
have you tried: 8-player speedrun?
SmallAnt, you honestly have the best spots out of everyone.
Are we giving him a YouTube video? Maybe...
How can you play this?
Damn look at all the Mario's
13:11 THAT'S WHAT SHE-
haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
They should've added pointcrow
There should be a second motivation along side of the time motivation to have the number of kills each person has, that way if you can’t win by time you could still win with kills and so you don’t just put the controller down, you could still win in the kill category.
Cj and smant good a rly good friendship dude, cj can just read smant like a book and its funny
Play the game with one finger. Specifically with your index finger? I am not sure, if that is the finger with right next to your thumb. I don’t care how you do it. You can mod it to make it easier with mods if you want. I don’t care. If you do it, I’ll subscribe to your YouTube Channel. Good luck, if you do it!
Do you think you can beat SMO with no pipes? I haven't played that much, but I don't think you have done it.
reminds me of the dream v. hunters a bit
ur awsome ant i luv ur content especially botw and minecraft
Would it be at all possible to do this in the super star mod?
man i forgot abt odyssey for a hot minute and seeing this video in my recommended makes me remember how fun it is especially your videos dude keep killin it
the fan art was really good!
"I'm pointing like you're gonna see that" i love these guys
Manhunt would be sick
i know how u cut the swears off with mario language... so mario always curse?
commit e
Could we see some more lowest percent content? The last uploads have each had 3 month gaps between them, would love to see The streak continued.
what if u use invisable hat?
10:36 I can’t😂
How is he still incapable of pronouncing her name lmao 😭
2:39 what did he say in chat?
69k likes, NOICE
Great video.
Everyone else: Lycel smant: lickel
So happy that crafty boss made this mod
Why do I find myself shipping Smallant with Lycel? Probably cos the two HaS videos I've watched with them in the cast has them be the seeker pair in both.
1AM, but screw sleep
CONGRATULATIONS CRAFTY!!!!!
Everytime I see one of these videos I get soooo pumped up!! 👏🏼👑😂😂
smant why don't you hide in the odyssey no ones going to look there
Super Mario Odyssey but every Moon U pick up teleports U to a random Spot ^^
I wish I could play like this on Super Mario Odyssey with my friends. Where can I find the mod?
You should try hide and seek with random gravity xD
I WISH I COULD DO THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
2:17 small ant sounded like Logan Paul
botordoryat - crafty 2022
16:45 bruh
Bro im not a bit by ut this is a sick vudwo. Keep the hype up!
Well that clip is totally going to be used in only the most wholesome way and definitely not as weird out of context one
14:00  Oh my god, are we giving him a YouTube video? Ant: Maybe?
I have a question for Smallant: Is it possible to collect all the required amount of moons in the lost kingdom without retrieving cappy?
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo monkey
I know these videos are probably a nightmare to edit, but they are really entertaining and I love watching them. Please make more.
This is so fun, I was smiling the entire video. Really hope you make more of these. Also props to the editor
poor poobear i felt him when he missed that cap throw
Hide in the odyssey, no one will look
Alpharad wearing a pirate outfit with a straw hat explains it all
Crafty is the master he always do a comeback xD
1:20 I’d imagine that if these parts were animated, everyone would look like their respective selves but whenever they swear and a Mario sound plays, their face quickly transforms into Mario to act out what he says and then returns back to their face (except for Crafty where his default face is Mario and transforms into like the Switch icon he has for his icon)
“You son of a wohooo~”
you should do randomized warp hide n seek
Super Mario games are so fun to be playing, but in the past live im gonna play it, maybe record it
That's pretty cool.. : 0)
If Crafty did all of that he's a god good job Crafty (He's a crafty little boss)
This is like my third time watching this and it's the first time I properly processed Lycel's comment "Snow my be-loathed" at 16:12 Made me laugh.
“hes in a fish” 😳
i love how lycel was SO confident in her spot she just went away to use the bathroom LOL wish we could've seen her reaction as soon as she saw her screen
imagine if they allowed hiders to teleport and all the seekers have to learn how to crc to get smant in cascade
bruh this is awesome
Wish I could play this mod
Ant and Alpha in the same video is so great, because they think so similarly.
One of the best things about this dude is that he never takes credit for himself when he uploads. We should appreciate him for how he always manages to respect us, the audience, and how he’s always uploading amazing new content for us viewers ❤️❤️
16:34
Nice
Hello Smallant! I have some Super Mario Odyssey speedrun categories for you to try out  Someone else must have thought of this before me but I am just saying what I found to be interesting. It is captain toad%, a speedrun where you interact with captain toad in all kingdoms as quick as possible while progressing through the game using moons to power the odyssey and using paintings. This could potentially be a pretty competitive category because everyone loves captain toad right?  hope you get the record in this category; i however cannot do this because my old and beat-up switch lite doesn't calibrate certain motion inputs. I also wish that this could possibly give you some more hours of fun in Super Mario Odyssey. Have a good day/night!
I've never played Odyssey in my life and have little interest in speedrunning but goddamn is this entertaining asf
Okay hear me out - CJ looks like a discount George Russell, or is it just me?
are you gonna do something else with it or no
25:20 "sure, and then i saw a negro" 😭
Surprised that there isn't a squid race game on a custom map yet. Those squid things on a race track with obstacles and hazards would be fun.
This SERIOUSLY makes me wishes Super Mario Odyssey had Multiplayer Hide & Seek in the actual game.  It just looks like so much fun honestly.
God please be sure that I can get my life and my mommy and my baby and my daddy
Wait, are they allowed to go out of bounds
"Alpharad" "What" *gets ground pounded* "Ah"
so hyped to see these types of videos
What the hide and seek in Snow kingdom explains to me: If u bonk u r STUPID
This is delightful lol
i remember finding that seaside water shooter glitch like a year ago when trying to fly lol XD
11:29 read chat wtf are these conversations
i love it and mostly the racing part.
13:28 just like all my girlfriends
17:09 how 25:39 lol the face
This kind of reminds me of the baloon search thing. Expect much more interactive
Mario odyssey multiplier sounds so fun
Logan Paul once said 2:17
So fun to watch.
Is this possible to do with my friends? Or is it hard to set up?
If yo leg get cut off  where you gonna feel the pain-?
11:30 i'm dying, jacob's face is so good here he's literally just watching chaos unfold
16:00 i died when he said "small anthony"
Gushen racing new game type
12:36 Its raining seekers 🤣
16:34 AYO?!?!
How do you play online?
I had an idea where its hide and seek, but the goal is to get as far as you can in the game. It starts with 1-2 seekers, and everyone gets a 1-3 minute headstart. They all have to try and get farther into the game while the seekers try catching them.
I love the editor's choice of censoring out words with mario's jumping sounds - 10/10
Smant what’s the most deadly Disney movie
I can't imagine how popular Mario Hide-n-Seek would be if Nintendo released an official game.
I thought hiders weren't allowed to use captures.
"what is everyone's final times?" Everyone: "their time" CJ: "i did very well"
gimme more
Yay Crafty, he did it!
I have an idea for 30 people to hide but the hiders can hide in any kingdom
yesss i’m so glad to see micro collabing again after his stream break
dOES THE WINNER GET TO POST THE VIDEO?
This was pretty cool. Nice.
wanna talk about how if smallant had won this videos title would have been "How I Became The Best Mario Odyssey Hide N Seek Player"
love the moment when in snow kingdom Jacob says "He's by the snow"
Firbatum
made on a special day
Can you make mod that makes you change capture every 5min
Sonic 🏃🏿‍♂️
"Oh my God, are we giving smant a youtube video???" "MAYBE???"
bro nicro added so much to this with not hiding just making the seekers struggle to get him like in the squid thing. im sad that the lava bubble didnt really work out though
wher ethe fuck is subnautica
Hay ant could you collaborate with me pls I’m not much of a creator yet but if u collaborated with me that would be a big boost
HIDE N SEEK TAG* 😭
They should do a game mode called gushen tag
Bet u won’t beat smo without doing XD skip XD XD XD XD XD XD
I wonder If multi player will be possible in browsers fury one day
"Fur baited" "Yeah, he's a master at that"  Wonderful, SmallAnt!
you guys should do 1 hider vs 7 seekers
I HAVENT WATCHED THIS YET
Could you do a “Mario manhunt” pls
I would be so happy if you got ScottFalco in on this.
Bubble race it is so great.
I thought of a video for you: I tried to beat SMO but I'm being chased constantly by [opponent(s)]
I love having crafty to get the modder's perspective directly on stream! It always seems like the person who actually made the mod is just a mysterious, intriguing figure that fades into the background, but not this time!
Do it with floor is lava
Can you do something like „Manhunt“ in Odyssey with this mod? So you have to beat the game while Cj and Crafty (e.g.) hunt you and try to stop you?
He's inside a squid, he's inside me... hmmmmm ;P
8:33
new type of coop speedrun?
do a video on cup head please
play cuphead
Is This On Yuzu? Or Modded Switches
I can't hear nicro talk without expecting him to say "mario" every other word, lmao
Jaiden and ludwig should be next for 10 player
bro u look and sound like crispy concords
how do you see pixels 2:16
"he's by the snow" I face palmed unironically
this is just soo cool
CraftyGoat
anyone else wanna see 8 players speedrun the game?
Just use the invisibility hat
Do more vids pls!
10:34
16:01 Small Anthony. lol
omg i saw this on twicht
2:17 - logan paul be like
Gushen chase pog
Smant: "he's in the snow" *if you dong get it there's snow everywhere
Mario Odyssey Hide N Seek in Multiple Kingdoms
YESSSS A FULL UPLOAD OF HIDE AND SEEK. THANK YOUUU 🥰🥰🥰
Another awesome video Smant!
Can't wait for the 16 people in one game
idea : do this same challenge in superstar mode
12:36 alpharad is like: chat they're never gona check the life house Fir: alpharad Alpharad: what Then he gets found  So funny
It's funny how Smallant was hiding in the middle of the geyser and CJ said he would be hiding there but never thought about looking there.
These hide n' seek videos are so good. Crafty MVP for sure.  Also, have you considered inviting 360Chrism? I think that would be very fun too
12:34  "They will never look here" "What?" *dies* "Ah."
2.3 mil subs????????? i remember when you were at like 600 k, gj man
I feel like some of the ridiculous chase scenes could be rectified (or possibly ruined) by giving seekers a small speed boost.
I've been hearing about this legendary gushen chase for literally a whole month.  Bro that shit lived up to the hype. Great video!
For a OG like Nicro to not stream or go live in a year and barely play Mario odyssey, he did really well and the way he bamboozled everyone with the lava bubble was smart as hell We HAAAAVE to give Nicro props for getting 3rd for not playing in a little over a year.
Wahoo
Hey Smant. It's sometimes difficult to keep track of who is searching and who is hiding. Think it could be possible to have a little label indicating who's who?  Would love to see more of this, thanks for the great content!
just use the invisibility hat -_-
MORE SUBNAUTICA
Mario t. Game! 13:30
"I got blown!" nice
Hide and seek coming to a powerpoint presentation near you...
Smant cjya and crafty are the only people that aren’t annoying tbh
Thank you for the video.
you should do another botw 100% speedrun that will be great! and you're an expert now! love Tanner you're amazing!
What an amazing video, and Crafty with the W! He deserves :)
lickle😭
Great video
am I the only one trying to figure out how the odyssey had 2 marios sitting and it actually looked official?
I snack on shredded lettuce
I SWEAR I HEARD JAIDEN SAY “migrating east”
More. I want more of this, it's just so fun to watch. You guys are great.
16:20 "i got blooown"
Hi
"Are we giving smant a yr video?"
ROLL THE WHEEL, ROLL THE WHEEL!
nicro being chill af while people are raging trying to catch him was the funniest thing ive seen in a month
Do no kubfu% start a swsh game new save Rules Release kubfu Talk to musterd And do normal story Oh and use a team of 6
“It’s not a tree in the traditional sense” Fun fact, palm trees are actually just huge grass.
Hes masterd the arts of bating lol
I hope ant does a Nintendo switch sports speed run! When it’s out :3 ❤️
Where is kirby i was so hyped up for it
30:16 Good Chills impression
You should do a high score challenge on Mrs. Pac-Man.
This is great
To The Gushen Chase Scene,       Fast and Floatius 8: Floatio Drift
Just use invisible cap lol
Smant loves the moon chapel lol
Can you send me the mario odyssey moon randomizer link?
Props to crafty
Everybody just drifting on the water to get nicro. I get it for Content ID but that would be a prime option to play running in the 90s LOL
i miss failboat
How hide and seek can be so thrilling to watch? idk but I love every video of it!
It's really cool that you can see Crafty's movement improvement since the series started, as well as the improvements he's made to the mod
Poo yet again killing himself as fast as he can, truly a master of hide and seek
when is this mod gonna go public 🦔❄
Man. I have wanted crafty to win one from the start. Finally he got one yay for you craftyboss. Been rooting for a win.
muito tempo que eu não via um vídeo bom assim, deu saudade da epoca do venom monark e feromonas. mais algum br no chat do smallant?
I'm so happy that Crafty finally won one
The Mario Hide And Seek is great, though the worst part about the 8-player variety here is that between all the quick cuts and different movements, it's super hard to tell who's actually "it" and chasing. It wasn't this hard on the 4-player videos. Maybe there's a graphical overlay or some kind of visual aid possible.
Smant calling lycel "lick-el" the whole time
Good for crafty finally winning one of these
Do all captures %
Cj reading Ant like a BOOK
All in favor of squid tag 🙌
I adore these videos
Nice
Hopefully nintendo doesnt take this down theyre so strict with take downs
unbanning captures just opened up a whole new world of possibilities...
Nobody realised the open chests were client side, inside a chest would have been an amazing spot.
13:05 Squid Race is one of the Squid Games
6:42 wait does this mode just assume that every pipe is facing down?
mad props for the 8-way edits to get this video. Honestly...
Beat arceus with 100% catch rate! You won’t
thank you for making me laugh, smant. my bf of two years dumped me and i’ve been crying for three days now. but watching your videos made me stop for a bit. i’m tired. gonna sleep. thank you.
more hide and seekkk!!!
Crafty is awesome, now there’s videos made for his mods that were developed by the cool guys
reply to this for a free woop
ALPHARD DESBUG BETTER THAN U
In the first world Jacob coulda stayed in the chest and noone would saw him lol
Up to 16 players with 2P :P
mans makes Mario 10* better
of course the use discord
i love how everyone is worrying about their spot in the first round and crafty is just talking about how hungry he is
These are my favorite videos to watch!
Wait, is Lycel really pronounced like "nickel" with an L?
nothing was funnier than cj saying "I did really well" instead of actually giving his time
11:11 holy crap its Barry!
loving the more consistent uploads, but I'm wondering when we're gonna see the XD Gale of Darkness playthrough on YouTube? it was quite awhile ago that it was streamed
Alpharad looks really good
I love alpharad’s outfit choice :)  Gear 5.. :3
Dude the flow of YouTube content has been the best. I pretty much always have something to watch from you if have 30min to spare. Its been great keep it up my man
These videos are great and make me smile :)
Súper Mario hide and odyseek
when do we get super mario royale
That was incredibly well edited
"Are we giving him a youtube video?"  "Maybe"  Alpharad is powerful, but Smant is powerfuler
Finally the day has come. My boy Crafty won. I can finally die in peace.
Is it just me or does Crafty sound like a young Michael Cera ?
that's alotta men
Good content
I legit thought that the first second into the vid he was gonna sing fly me to the moon. Don't blame me! Listen to it for yourself
Always rooting for Crafty
2:16 how the hell did u see them there? i knew they were there and i couldn't even see them from your point of view
Ah, this was a memorable one. Alpha's repetitive jumping out and back into the cubby in Moon, the Gushen chase, Crafty looping through the flower road subarea, then Nicro pulling off a repeat Gushen chase in the Klepto subarea.
I was here for this stream
13:12 that sounds wrong 16:55 lol fir bait . fur bait
0:35 the mario moon migration is quite a miracle of nature
Crafty pog Cjay first to last IN SHAMBLES
Please do a multiplayer speed run,not a race but you have to complete the game as fast as possible
I don’t even have 8 friends
10:34 the chase begins
Bro, these uploads are more consistent than my will to live
Not the first time. CJ did a video on 8 player a month ago 😳
27:45  LOL
Crafty is truly the SMO MVP. I have not had this much fun watching SMO before. I'm also totally into this underdog story he has, he's improved at hiding and seeking and gameplay in general.
Great vid. Love the collabs
I do think Jacob’s biggest weakness in this game is his cockiness. I feel like that’s what keeps him being a relatively average competitive/items player, every time he does alright he acts like he’s invincible. He’s like the real life Pit: mid tier with an Icarus complex
0:53 Alpharad just here singing smoke on the water
YES happy birthday to me
Can you beat Pokémon but you have one hp???
i never realized how much i like using Mario soundbytes to Censor bad words...especially at 13:53 -- "OH [Hee-Hee!]! OH [Hee-Hee]!" xD
c:
I tried to hold in my laugh during the seaside kingdom part xD great video!
12:35 i don’t know why but this is the funniest shit ever
,,Are we giving him a yt video?" ,,MaYbE"
This is not Hide and seek. it's call tag
"Fir is a master at baiting me" prob wasn't intentionally but, nice one
How come this wasn’t titled Mario ManHunt with 8 Hunters
cool
14:00 "Are we giving him a YouTube video??"  Yes, yes you are.
This is absolute ultimate content.
So has anybody made the stat tracking site yet?
Who else is glad smant lost. This dude has an ego and you can tell he’s a sore loser. He’s got great videos tho and I like seeing smaller youtubers coming out on top. Gg crafty
Is alpha's timer going while he's hiding in seaside?
With 8 players, how do they know who's who? This is pure chaos.
that was very fun to watch
" *NO* , I was INSIDE YOU!"  Ayo-
Alpharad has best mario x luffy cosplay
Seeing the potential in this video really makes me want a multiplayer gushen or podeboo race, perhaps on a custom race course! I think that’d be really cool to watch.
When watching this, this vid is #1 on trending for gaming
play more squde race
Other than Alpharad, great video!
Ok so I have a question about this. If you do a Co-op with 2 people, who's save is it? Can you choose?
Fir is the master baiter
20:00 "He's by the snow" - Alpharad, 2022
poor cj got owned smant was close but GGS
This Game Still Looks Amazing even in 2022! I Hope Nintendo Make a Sequel to Mario Odyssey in the Future!
Crafty Boss either has the most obvious spots or manages to disappear from reality like Amelia Earhart over the Atlantic, no in between
"Alpharad." "What?" *Alpha dies* "Ah." Great line
why don't you do a hide and seek with friends and your mom
That thumbnail is so delightful! I just love how the marios walk with such assertiveness but they're also just chunky little guys
Petition to make Squid Racing a game mode.
Small Anthony
Why does fir look like that
editor is literally crazy good w these videos. so many streams to piece together and it never feels chaotic or messy the whole video is easy to read and i dont ever get lost...that's so crazy good
Grand Poo Bear is so wholesome
Alpharad, telling his teammates how to find the guy he's chasing in Snow Kingdom: "He's by the snow"
Crafty is the best
"Ah"  - Jacob Alpharad
18:08 personal mark
That entire chase sequence in Seaside had me wheezing the whole time.
Lycel's "snow kingdom, my beloathed" rly made me laugh
If Nintendo doesn't add official online to Oddessy 2 I would be surprised. This is really popular
I watch a lot of yt content and these hide and seeks are the best content without a doubt
We need moar!
Now I really want to see gushed racing.
12:35 is an artwork masterpiece entitled "ah"
I live for this type of collaboration content. Keep it up boys!
wow everyone
Yeahhgggg
The squid tag was so funny, i could honestly watch it for hours lmaoo
In moon cave i would have destroyed stone and then nobody would find you
This is way too much fun to watch, it's great
I'm waiting for Metro Kingdom!!
"oh my god, are we giving him a youtube video?" Is by far the best line in this.
The added Mario sound effects to censor people is absolutely hilarious! XD
Imagine if Ant just kept doing Nut jump high above where no one could catch him..
Bet you cant speedrun a jappanese horror game
Def want to see more of this. Just saying…
craftyboss best of all, i love his voice so much
So they managed to create a game (Squidrace), inside of a game( Hide and Seek), that is also inside of a game (Mario Odyssey). Interesting
7:28 smant on the ramp
Gushen racing needs to become a game
This is never going to be boring with you guys this is amazing
Smant your videos are the best and the hide n seek is my favourite
8:21
Everyone's playing mind games now... this is smant's fault
I love these hide and seek videos!
Day four of asking smallant to beat the pokedex ewith only shinies
This is just so entertaining. I hope there will be some really good custom kingdoms so this can stay fresh
Now this is awesome
SMANTi have a good spot you should stay in the race
Smallant should do Mario manhunt- speedrunner vs. hunters like dream does for mc
Yes right after the last day of term 1 at school for me lesgoo thanks smant
2:17 - Logan Paul 2018
I love the chaos that comes with this, especially when it comes to the gushins. That just had me dying the whole time
Anyone need GTA 5 Premium Edition? I will be giving it away, I don't get time to play it. I've purchased it for free while Epic Games announced giveaway. If you're passionate with GTA if you don't have it please kindly reply. Thank you!
MARIO  I think a good idea
16:47 "Fir might be baiting me but... he is a master at that" killed me
Why did you edit out all the search for crafty? That was the best part
In a special ops, i would probably take the girl on my team over small ant. Her composure is inhuman.
CJ has smant sream open on the ready, always calling out exactly where he is
11:55 - 12:10 **Me and the bois out of context**
Yo 3 on trending Smallant is taking over
Top 7 on trending
The title is incorrect.   It should be "Smallant sits back as his friends give him enough content for HALF AN HOUR"
12:00 AYO??!?
This was so funny
Smant the maester at hide n seek
Among us lobby energy
YEAH CRAFTY I'VE BEEN ROOTING FOR YOU SINCE THE BEGINNING I'M SO PROUD
WAYTOODANK
Poor Poo. Always kills himself.
Are we giving him a YouTube video?
What
I. Want. MORE
gpb is so damn bad at this game AND it’s terminologies
This editing style with the full stream clips is fuckin genius. Feels more like a collab video than just another Smant video
"Are we giving him a YouTube video?"
good video👍
I can’t wait to watch the next round! I love odyssey hide and seek so much!
Im watching it even though i watched it on stream
So that's how the rule of no captures when escaping came to be xx  You really haven't played a game until a new rule has been made because of you. Nicely done, Nicro x
12:42 "Alpharad" "What ?" *Ad break* that was such a perfect timing for a "we'll be back soon" Lol
there should be some sort of punishment for the worst hider would up the stakes a bit
😆
I love this content
Wait u can play online super mario odesy?
#2 on trending for gaming! Absolutely huge!
Anyone have that Lycel clip of her saying “I eat small children” in French?
This video is funny as hell!! XD
Honestly, with the amount of lag going on, this looks so frustrating for the seekers
Is multiplayer a mod or no
The editing on this video is insane, showing all the perspectives and important movements so fluidly. Good job.
Crafty is the goat
Is it just me or does cj sound like Barry benson?
so the stereotypes are as follows smant: complex jumps poo: bush crafty: ledge grab nicro: NIGERUNDAYO
Yo, y’all could play Sharks and Minnows!! Would be a great vid
Alpha saying “he’s by the snow” around 20:00 was amazing
How come crafty never shows his face ?? I must see senpia
"Is it just SmallAnt? Are we giving him a youtube video?" me, watching this on youtube: Yes, yes you are.
Poor Alpha had his chat make fun of him for not knowing hats didn't count even though it's his first time.
This was awesome.
I'VE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS FINALLY
12:00 lul
All of these hide and seek videos are brilliant 😂
Gamers don't look up
Ant hit 30 mins before cj hit 30 seconds
"Oh no! The guy with a bunch of subs is gonna upload a video with me in it?" I almost choked
This is so cool
neat.
Crafty! Crafty! Crafty!
"he's by the snow"
I find it hilarious that Alpharad always goes for the easiest hiding spots and it ends up working out...
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS
Thumbnail: if The Beatles were 8 Italian plumbers
is this a repost? I swear Ive already seen this video
Please just make more of these.
u give the seekers like +2 minis for each person found
Is the mod planned to get released to the public someday? Would love to play with my friends.
We need more
i love alpharad's misdirection when people are chasing other hiders
i dont know why, but CJ saying “small Anthony” made me laugh so hard
you should try 1 hider &  7 seekers in each kingdom
Are we giving him a youtbe video 😈
Thank you for the video! You have a very interesting channel! And I am 20 years old, unfortunately I am disabled, I live with my parents. I never had friends in real life, as well as relationships, I spent my whole life on the Internet. I also created a channel that can draw attention to this, though so far little has been done ((( I am writing this comment just to wish you health and good mood. Rejoice and connect with a friend. And if you suddenly feel bad at heart, remember this comment Only forward! Looking forward to your next . Good luck!!!
cj did really well guys
I appreciate alpharad's luffy costume
Crafty, my beloved   I found this series by my recommendations and for some reason my personal favs are currently Crafty and Smallant, I’m debating on finishing my fanart from the one where Smallant hid on top of the 2D wall in Moon Kingdom, I just don’t know where to post it lol
NUMBA 2 TRENDIN, LEGOS
You should really see if Seananners would want to join mario odyssey. I know he's not really in your regular circle, but he's one of the most entertaining people when it comes to hide and seek games, and he used to play them a ton back in the day with people like ZeRoyalViking, Hutch, and Sp00nerism (Tbh if you haven't heard of him being so big on youtube you're kinda weird). I'm sure he'd love to join in for something like this
Nice
i was only a matter of time before we got this video.
11:54 anyone else hearin deja vu?
sus
I wanna see this with proximity voice chat lmao
Woaahh where is round 2?
As a Craftyboss fan, this video makes me very happy
Am I a bad fan for rooting for Crafty over Smant?
Love these
•
Super Mario Odyssey Squid Race sounds like a great minigame
pog i like these videos
hear me out tho, squid tag. survive as long as you can with extra taggers added in after a specific amount of time
10:55 yes your playing that homebrew game called Böbl
This is why he deserved that award for speed running he got good content and looks drippy while doing it
I love these videos man, great content!
im sure someone has said this before but im not in the loop with any of these creators. cj sounds like jerry seinfeld some fraction of the time
Mario squid game lol. I love these so much.
This content 😩💕💓💖💕💗💖💕💗🚨💕💗
Love the thumbnail
"Is he the cheep-cheep?" "No, I'm the cheep-cheep."  Made me laugh like a maniac, and there's no reason for it.
"I dont understand what the f- WOO! -ck is going on right now" - Crafty
Crafty: Expert modder, MVP, winner of most games.
i’m loving all the vids and vods thank u so much
More like CraftyGOAT
This is legitimately some of the most cool content you have ever put out, great video SmallAnt
When we get to the point where we can do 64 player SMO Battle Royale
You should play with the any% record holder
A fun and close game to watch and an amazing job on the mod from Crafty! The chases were gold this video xD
Huh
Crafty has honestly gotten so good at hide n seek even tho he started as probably the worst in the first video
3 on trending!
First!
Yooooooo number three on gam my trending
W
:>
damn alpha found the one piece before luffy
Hide and seek, but Cappy tries to kill you
we need a map mod specifically for hide and seek
This is the most wholesome comment section ever
"Are we giving him a YouTube video?" "Maybe...😏" Good thing they did
my friend xeen
*My life goal has been fulfilled*
Seeing Jacob immediately being competitive shaking his controller at the start while everyone else calmly going to the same hiding spot…  “No I’m not!” 😂 Never change, Alpha.
its gold D. roger :0 17:12
Are we not gonna talk about how much craftys movement has improved throughout this?!
Crafty is so fun
I'm so fing happy crafty finally won one. He deserved at least one win.
Exactly what I need at 2:26 am
“Oh my god are we giving him a YouTube video” LMAO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
nicro being chased was the funniest thing i've ever seen
Dude, Nicro in a lava bubble, in the place where you lose Cappy has to be one of the most insane hiding spots in this series. The sheer genius of that spot is incredible. Also, Crafty won. That hasn't happened in a while. Was rooting for you in Snow Kingdom that whole time
Alpharad and SmallAnt collab let's go
"Are we giving him a YouTube video?"
I love fir
Smant is like the big brother everybody wants to team with or team against. Like “we should all team up to beat Smant I don’t care who wins”
do one in a mod of it that adds new maps but you dont know any of the locations and you find it out as you play
“You son of a bi- wahoo!” 1:20
Ive been here with you on this smo journey since you hit 900k subs now look at you 2.2mil??? BRO BIG IMPROVEMENT like to see your channel get bigger and better and now you can play smo with your friends happy for you smallant love you man
Amazing job by whoever edited this.
Never thought I'd see GrandPooBear and Alpharad collab, I've been watching both since like 2016 damn
YesssSssssSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
I think most of the rounds Poo just dies before getting caught lmao
Crafty is the boss
In the event that there's ever a full-on Tag Team Mario Odyssey Hide & Seek, I will do everything in my power to make sure Fir's team is called "Boots With Da Fir."
Your really been popping off with this hide and seek content smallant probably the best videos on youtube thank you
number 3 on trending man
cj has a good spot everywhere
when I first got to seaside about a week after the game came out, i found out the bubble thing where smant was hiding, surprised that some speedrunners didn't know that.
2:17 Logan Paul be like:
Alpha juking was hilarious he should come more often
Crafty and everyone else who helped is so awesome for making this mod as someone whos going into game dev even seing cool mods of existing games like these is so inspiring :}
even when smallant is hiding, he's seeking.
This is cool but 8 people feels like too much to follow when compared to the 4 people videos Still fun to watch, thanks
I wanna see the second round!
Crafty supporter stocks soaring after this one
I absolutely love the mario tag videos. Pls keep uploading them.
Nice
Anyone notice that Nicro doesn't try and seek when he gets caught?
Man, they need pars on these hide n seek games or something. Hiders should get free extra time or something on some worlds. They're just so much smaller!
28:12 “Someone wanna go to the odyssey” Why so suddenly, when ant just got there. Very suspicious coincidence
SmallAnt: gets spotted Lycel: guess I'll die  Also, the dude who made a fanart is great and spid
but not fearsome??
Alphrad: ar- smallant: yes
Nicro made this video amazing!
THANK GOD SOMEONE USED THE BEATLES THUMBNAIL
I want y'all to know that I zoned out, and heard 25:25 on its own, without ANY context. I was VERY confused as to who and what I was watching LMAO
The gushen race makes me realize how weird it is that something like that isn't in the game. It's like the squids from Sunshine
Monke moment
More of this please :)
25:25 with no context 😂
This man better upload the next round
Yo they kinda zoomin
I was very confused with people pronouncing Lycel's name with Lysol, rather than Lykel...i honestly thought that was how you pronounced it cuz of Smant.
hhahahaha right as i watched all of the hide and seek videos this one gets uploaded
8:04 lycel corrected CJ when he said smant instead of smallant
Yesss white peopllleee
broke: mario odyssey  woke: kirby car game  seriously upload the rest of krimbo pls i need sustenance
more pls MORE!
"Nicro, what happened?" "SQUID RACE!!"
Damn crafty is very good at modding Odyssey, the gameplay looks smooth
Always love how well CJ knows Smant
I couldn’t keep a straight face if I played w small ant.
I want to see more compilation like that :) The problem of the live, is that we don't have the other point of view.
well well, if it isn't the guy that always complains because he doesn't have friends to play with ?
"is it just SmallAnt again- Oh my god, are we giving him a Youtube video?" is probably the funniest thing I've heard all day.
can you do one where there’s only 1 hider and they’re invisible
"Alpharad" "What?" Dies "Ah"
Next time they should minus their seeking time from their whole hiding time so more skill in game Is rewarded
10 players when
What a coincidence number 8 on trending with 8 people
This was really funny. I really herp they make another video like this sometime.
You should do a challenge where you try to speedrun the game while 2 other people try to kill you. Kind of like a Minecraft Manhunt.
is that luffy
All Star Tag
Maybe I'll get tired of this kinda thing eventually, but that certainly hasn't happened yet. I love watching these.
Hey I saw this on poobears vid
Smant, you have no reason to believe me, but that trick you did at 9:01 I’ve known about since the game came out. I never saw anyone showcase it on YouTube so I always assumed I was one of the few people who knew of its existence.  I also happen to know that when you do the trick, the jet won’t shoot you back up unless you touch another body of water. So you could leave the jet, run around the sand a bunch, come back and just walk into it and it works.
Cj Won? This is like Golf, right?
Fucking love the hide n seek vids
dang crafty pulling the jukes and the insane plays this episode of hide and seek nicro also doing the smartest plays ever
Yes baby been voting for crafty forever
I NEED ROUND 2 NOW!
Lycel thinking she was safe was a funny flex
Crafty will forever be the GOAT for figuring out multiplayer on SMO
Next time you do hide and seek, make everyone do the most obvious spots
yea
i would like to see other gamemodes in multiplayer other than hide and seek implemented in multiplayer it has soooo much potential for creativity
I love watching these videos!!!!!!
props to the editor, thats alot of povs
Some lines that are weird out of the vid  “He’s in a fish”  “Im coming” Im in a fish
Honestly, so proud of Crafty for winning in 8-player.
we NEED more of this stuff
Not sure how this works, been some time since I played Odyssey, but can you guy possibly make your hats invisible so captures can be used as hiding spots too if you blend in just right?
2:17 that’s what Logan Paul said
"hey Alpharad" "yeah? .....ah"
Cue the Benny Hill Theme Song for that Gushen chase 🤣  Edit: yep. Tried it. It works so well for that part 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
10:33 Personal timestamp
Could we all just appreciate the uploads that Smant has been putting in? Huge thanks to him and his editing crew because it's been amazing!
Damn cliffhangers
they should play one but only hiding in captures while pretending to be one.
Hats don’t count you have to physically hit em🥸
truly a star studded cast, amazing video. Also Crafty the GOAT
I really love these videos:)
weird dream but I wonder what would happen if you could do multiplayer on a nintendo pokemon game world
YES!!!!
this has gotta be the most fun SMO minigame. I love this
They find the weirdest hiding spots that only 200iq players can come up with
it's cool how we can see crafty getting better each video
It’s so funny how well CJ knows Tanner. Every time there’s a crowd after him, CJ just perfectly predicts how to direct them
lol you should try to enlist pointcrow in ur mario shenanigans
Ee need the vod
Rill the wheel role the wheel!
the first time, yep
Crafty STAYS getting talked over in these vids but I always appreciate his presence. Sorry you didn't get breakfast bro.
Truly is an all star cast i love watching these!
NICROOO
Please put this mode in odyssey 2
"Fir might be baiting me, he is a master at that."
If its funny then its fine- the rule of content
So many parts of this video can be taken out of context, especially when they kept saying “I’m inside him!”
12:35 is literally the perfect clip
Praise God
That thumbnail is great, it's like they're all baby ducks
I love that Crafty won. He always seems like the underdog.
21:13 Why was that kinda smooth.
Hi
Ho
Never get bored of Odyssey hide and seek!
man shoutout to the editor for compiling 8 different POVs into a single video
8 Players makes for such an Intense and Very Fun Hide-n-Seek game!  Was So Fun To Watch!!!
SO GOOD!!!
Its funny how often Poo just kills himself accidentally.  Hes trying his best!
I was upset to see smallant lose but crafty definitely deserved the win for juking everyone out so many times
4:15 Ant being on top of the chapel is such a "Gamers don't look up" moment
“Oh my god are we giving him a YouTube video?”  “Maybe”
My boi Straw Hat Mario in the Mugiwario pirates.
This might be the least clickbaity smant title I've ever seen
I cannot express the amount of joy I feel whenever Smant, Cjya, Poobear, Fir, or Crafty release an SMO hide and seek video
These absolutely never get old
12:41 “ah”
sure as hell gave you a yt video
5:24 lmao alpha giving out fake tips is really funny
7:31 CJ got so mad he turned into Seinfeld
crafty winning was the good edning
Dont know what it is, but I will never get tired of these hide and seek vids
*I PLAYED SUPER MARIO ODYSSEY HIDE N SEEK  lol
Damn I already saw this fan edit
I like that the last two seekers had exactly 20 minutes in between their times
I find it hilarious that Smant and Alpha both did the same trick of getting just barely out of sight and pretending they left to keep hiding for longer in round 1
I was watching and I was like "Yes they are doing another round!" then the video ended.
as someone who does not know many of these people, I have no idea who is hider and who is seeker. Can there be indicators on future videos, like who is what Mario and who is currently seeker/hider?
Let's go Crafty! I'm always rooting for him because he's an underdog who often can't match the skill of the others and has low confidence in his ability to hide and evade, but he's definitely gotten better at movement after all this hide and seek. Love to see him outsmart all of them like he did in that Snow sub-area and snatch the win out from under Tanner's nose. Showing them he's not just along for the ride to troubleshoot the mod, he's in it for real!
Unfortunately Poo has released a video 3 days ago with the exact same rounds. I'll like the video though!
Every time I watch one of these, I can't help but laugh. But then SmallAnt just doubles over to an area where someone else is hiding and outs them, and all I can think is "Man, what a real dick move."
small ant should do a mario manhunt
I can’t get enough of Mario odyssey multiplayer content. It’s just too good!
I liked the alpharad one piece reference
30 MINUTES?? OH BOY THIS IS GONNA BE HELLA FUN
How can someone get ahold of this mod?
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Imagine a 4v4 Bingo/Lockout game, that would be so fun.
Thumbnail is great 👍 😂😂
The koopa freerunning music adds so much to the experience
"Are we giving him a YouTube video?"... Perhaps...
Nicro caused both a Gushen Chase in Seaside, but also a Potaboo Chase in Lost. Nicro is kinda cracked ngl.
Smant as soon as a seeker leaves the odyssey, hide in it 9000 iq spot
I absolutely love the multuplayer Mario.
Jawsh not here? Unsubscribed
I saw this on Lumation's channel a whole ago, but I'm happy to see this in here so many more people will see this. plus the editing is different so it's like playing a different characters perspective.
It's getting better and better every hide and seek video been waiting for this!
"Another round?" The way they said it reminds me so much about playing party games with friends...
“He’s up top! I mean uh I don’t know how to explain anything on this map”  “HES BY THE SNOW!”  Lmaoo
Bro I love these hide ad seek videos, MAKE MORE!
This is an avenger level event
Alpharad- "are we giving him a Youtube video?".....Yes yes you are haha
This video is interesting with the huge chase. Also, if you take two-thirds of the video length (30:33) you get 2022 which is this year.
I’m glad the winner of this round got the dub 👏🏼
the wrong crow 😢
smant best yt
LET'S GO CRAFTY!!!!
pls more
All we need now is multiplayer botw
I like how as soon as I finished one of Pooh's recent videos on Hide'n'Seek, this one pops up.
Ant has to be one of my fav youtubers i love all the stuff he does
ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Mad props to the editor(s) of this video
Sense you got 8 people. Its clearly time for 20 people.
The question is why does small ant call lycel like that
How do you make it so if you touch another mario they die?
I wish this was online multiplayer
I can't wait for the VOD, also, consider being nice to pointcrow
Ant in 2023 "20 player  hide and seek in mario odyssey"
16:45 lmao master baiter
Shout out to alpha he's the king of the pirates
ma i really wish you uploaded this sooner cause I've seen this game already uploaded on like 2 separate channels, which seemed to have been formed exclusively to edit these hide and seek videos together because you guys are like so slow at it. didn't this game happen literally months ago now?
now this is epic
8? Try 100 player odyssey!!! (impossible)
"You know, I'm feeling pretty confident in this location. Which means it's probably gonna be found pretty quickly."                                                                     -Craftyboss, 2022
Iv’e been looking forward to this
Bro what “went inside of me” that’s sus
You got Alpharad in this goddamn
Sub to pooh
Broooooooooooooo you can’t end a video like that!!! 😢😢😢
Mad respect for nicro First dude to beat odyssey in under 1 hour
The SMO speedrunning communities creators are so genuine
I think it would be really interesting if you played this in superstar mode. I really love these videos and I think that would put a cool twist on the game mode.
From 4 to 8 some day its a 64 battle royale
Dbd hits different after the update
When in captures your time shouldn't increase so if someone camps in a capture or is constantly in one it doesn't help
Damn I was gonna prep for my DND session, guess I can wait
Crafty is mvp, literally, cause he made this.  So rare to see the actual modders on stream with the top tier guys. Congrats Crafty.
I remember i was watching firs stream with this and i fell asleep during it and when i wake up its 5 AM and i realise i havent gotten much sleep since 2 hrs ago
"I'm pointing like your gonna see that"  I love Cj

YESS ANOTHER GREAT VIDEO!!!!!
Super Mario Odyssey Hide and seek is the best that i could find on youtube, you can find pretty much good hidding spots, laugh alot and alot more
It's here!
Bro I love the hide and seek videos please don’t stop!
I could watch all 8 POVs of this and not get bored
Wgawhylag
Crafty is simultaneously a masterclass SMO modder and a very charming person to watch play it
Oh my God I was hoping to have more of this series, I love it so much
The Marioverse
11:33
Ant will You Guys ever realese the files and server connection for Multiplayer
NMNOCOMMEBTSEVEBTHOBEST
YESSSS ANOTHER HIDE AND SEEK VIDEO. I LIVE FOR THESE. lol but seriously speaking i don’t play much switch let alone mario odyssey but i fucking love these videos.
Tanner
alpha always has the best Strats
Wait Nicros back
Next up: 8 player mario odyssey deathmatch. 8 marios enter, 1 mario leaves
Se que no leerás esto, pero quiero que sepas que tus vídeos me ayudan a superar mis peores días. Te quiero mucho desde España🇪🇸
Crafty is gonna turn this game into the most popular MMORPG
"Are we giving Smant a YouTube video?"  Yes. Yes you did xD
Crafty creates the best mods for SMO, I love it!
I love alpharad's one piece themed costume
All I can ask is, why couldn’t Nintendo bother and make the game actually multiplayer. This mod is so good so you can’t say that it isn’t possible.
I was there doing homework
"Gamers don't look up" -kaif 2021        I think
crafty is the worst super mario odyssey player, but the best mario odyssey hide n seek player
he was in a fish, Ant, but not inefficient 😎
at this point nintendo should add this as an official update it looks so fun and fitting.
A tracker at the bottom showing who's seeking and who's hiding would make it a bit more easy to follow along
It would be so cool if crafty could make it so seekers can bounce on others hats  Edit: I don’t even know if this is possible and it’s a miracle that this mod even works.
I swear. Smallant and Fir are always at competition with each other.
why didnt you use the same spot as last time if you didnt tell them last time they would have never found you
we need a full squid race video
Crafty's just running circles through the same subarea LMAO
8-Bit!
omg thank you for all the youtube content man, this is the video weve been waiting for!
alpha saying he died because nobody was there, but smant was... gold
If I don’t have twitch, is there a way I can watch the entire hide n seek video or is there no full version?
"Are we giving him a YouTube video?" Me: uhhh... Yeah
525 comment. And also, here’s my creative comment: Amazing video! It was all really funny and I enjoyed every second! Good job, guys!
The fact that Crafty single handedly started a genre of smo videos is legendary
This mod is so entertaining. Ty Smant for making these vids!
dude i just finished the other hide and seek video??? based
Crafty played well third round
Small ant been grinding hella videos loving it
Is it out yet or are they gonna keep milking it untill it stops getting views? Lets us all play the mod.
More of this please, this is so great to watch 😄
25:25. I know he’s just saying Nicro weird. Probably a mispronunciation or misreading, but it REALLY sounds like he said a slur.
if they can use captures how long till one of them just pretends to be a normal enemy,maybe one of those squid dudes since the water bubble makes the hat less obvious
I like how everyone has their face shown for the intro and then there's just Crafty lol
Damn I saw an edit of this like a week ago… lol I think someone is beating you to the punch
aw man... imo, if you win 3 rounds, especially in an 8 player game, you win the game right? f that timer
I liked and subscribed, now to comment!
Meep
Love the vid!
He just stayed at the top! Genius!
Alpharad had a One Piece costume. Epic gamer man
Please never stop making these 👍
Nice
12:01 Hol’ up 🤨📸
In the fan art at 17:10, Lycel is upside-down!
Wko
5:14 woo
Crafty sounds so much like Interndotgif
This is a game of mind games and trickery... oh and then hide and seek
Why does CJ sound like Jerry Seinfeld?
Everyone has joined the battle! …of mayhem
Crafty finally wins one! Let's goooooo! Character growth moment.
Alpharad is a freaking magician
12:02 When your chilling with the boys.
You son of a- WAHOO
man i love cj :)
"Oh, god. Are we giving him a youtube video?"  "Maybe."
Alpharad is a master of the art of 'hiding in absolute f*cking plain sight'
God, I was into this video until I saw Alpharad
Finally!
props to the editor, working on this has to be crazy!
As someone who's been a long time sub of Alpharad it's extremely odd to be seeing the same content from both perspectives, especially since I honestly kinda forgot Alpha was huge in the speedrunning community for a while before he turned his attention to Smash
This must've been hell to edit.
the second round reminds me of an apex hide and seek game where a team got second place because a they got a vehicle and just tokyo drifted around on a lake with spectators hiding in plain sight just witnessing the chase, why hide when you can drift, truly
would have loved to have the names of the people on screen when it cuts to them. I have to admit i don’t know them so it would really help me. but otherwise great video!
Challenge Idea: Mario Odyssey But Mario Ground Pounds Every 5 Seconds. No Less Then 5 Seconds Because Mario Would Ground Pound Out Of The Ruined Wire Capture Making It Impossible To Start The Dragon Fight.
Good soup
Nicro could have just stayed hidden until he won but instead he invited everryone to come get him in a race. What a gigachad
I wish I had seven frie-
Nicro's chase in Seaside deserves some Benny Hill music
I love these hide n' seek videos
These hide and seek videos are amazing
yoooo???? another hide and seek??? LETS GOOOO
I like crafty, he was so happy after he found out that he won! He is so cute
SPEED RUIN LUIGES MANIION 3
I love how CJ can always divine where Smant is hiding. He just knows him so well.
Hi!!!!!!!
CJ instantly callin Smant out TWICE was hilarious.
I still think a mod for speedrunner vs hunters in super mario odyssey needs to happen and it will be fun to play and watch
So damn close holy shit
I love that he sensors the curses with Mario sounds, it’s so funny
I love that Crafty developed this, because he never says anything about it to the point that I almost forget that he did it
Is Liycel your girlfriend
love this series 🙌
6:34!  3:43 5:49 6:30 6:48 7:38 8:57 15:32 17:43 23:14 26:14 27:05 28:35
SmallAnt has made me come back to Mario Odyssey
lysol
the gushen bit was hilarious
I'm inside of him-smallant gang 2022
Things said in sea kingdom, stay in sea kingdom.
Yay i love these videos
WE NEED MORE OF THIS
ok, but how about we add an overlay with the characters so we can see them crossed off as they're found
wow
craftyboss is a legend for all these mods
These are my favorite uploads.
CezrDaPleazr dont swear
Smant, I think you should play more social deduction games like ultimate werewolf because you're a seasoned liar
I fucking love these videos
The editing on this is actually soo good. It's gotta take so much effort to piece together a video from 8 different streams. Well done!
this is one of my favorite series on youtube
i was only vaguely aware of nicro before hide and seek and oml he is amazing, i love how many incredible SMO creators are getting the spotlight from this minigame
“you finally actually went inside of me”
hi
The constant release of vids has been very much appreciated
Those are the kind of Videos i love
I would have loved a non edited version  of the whole stream good stuff
I love how jacob's barely played in the past few years, yet is one of the best players
This made my birthday by how funny it is, thank you man!
Crafty been Practicing
Fir "alphared" Alphared " ah"  Made me laugh 😂
Hello Ant do you like Japanese Spider-Man
I would of waited outside the balloon and right when they say 1 enter the balloon 100 iq
More more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
Im here before an hour
So good to finally see crafty win
@SmallAnt why don't you hide in the Odyssey? 😂
say yes if you dont like adverts
I wanna see a game of sardines with this mod
NICRO IS HERE YOOOOOO
props to the person that has to edit 8 different hour-long streams together to make a cohesive and entertaining video.
hey sponge popicle
Smo superstar mode hide and seek ?
i made a blue tak pizza (life sized)
Kool
Hey
I love how much Cyja knew Smant in that first round, immediately "he's on the Chapel again"
I NEED TO SAY I play ALOT of SUPER MARIO ODDESSY AND I KNOW ALOT OF SKIPS TO
Now this but Botw!
16:14
Keep the great videos up man! Love ya❤❤
it's so nice to have a video ever 2 days
Nicro be playing Grand Theft Gushin
Yooo we have 69k likes nice
*Snallanthany*
I love these...
I just finished watching all the other vids from the content creators from previous games. Convenient!
I didn’t even know this was a thing!
Crafty is cute. Love these vids
My favorite member of the crew won! This makes me very happy
I’m sorry but that is a fucking amazing thumbnail. It wouldn’t have mattered if I’d never watched you or this game before, I’d click for it.
I've already seen this on a fan edit, but I'ma watch it anyway.
YEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONGGGGGG
5:43 actual rain dodging holy kek
This is absolutely amazing! When will crafty finally release this? :/
Love you smant
you guys should play Gorilla Tag VR. It's totally not the most dangerous game ever that you definitely need to be around your fragile desk items so that you wont destroy them.
Good job smant keep it up
the ending was so intense with smant being SO CLOSE
.
This is true chaos wow this was fun
POG
Love it
yayyy i was waiting for this video
This new upload schedule goes hard.
I swear poo has died more to himself than being found lmao
43 minute crew   Perceived 367th comment
Crafty's part was insane tho
Mario Squid Race should become its own series.
You're not allowed to end videos like that.  You monster.
I suggest a squid race game that looked pretty fun ngl
My love for this video is deeper than the deepest ocean
😂
Craftyboss is not only king in Hiding, but also because he makes this great mod. Its so nice seeing all this Streamer Collab and chasing each other in capturers. This mods just gets better and better every month
40 min gang
"Chat, they're never gonna look at the light house, don't worry" *Instantly gets ground pounded*
is this amogusn? t
10:30
40m in!!!
if there's any suggestions for new games to try out,  highly recommend two old PS2 games called dark cloud and it's next entry Dark cloud 2 ( Dark chronicles for Europe audiences )
Another hide and seek video?
Finaly
14:02
Day 4 of Waiting for Smallant to play Oneshot and get their pc hacked
IM TOO FAST💧💧💧
Now, I want to see the other round.
Ayanokoji is coming back! (3 season too)
Why did 18:54 line up so well lmao 💀
this should end well..
Shield hero is rising!
w
Lucky me I just watched all the hide and seek videos for first time the other day
I’ve been watching all day the hide n seek Mario odyssey and now he makes a new one!
Love the consistent uploads!
Sheeesh Smallant is on an uploading streek🔥🔥
nice.
nice
Anyone else want them to do more Squid Race? Cause I want to that was rly entertaining and funny :)
Cyja is cursed to be eternally found instantly
nicro being chill af while people are raging trying to catch him was the funniest thing ive seen in a month
love the hide and seek content, and now it's bigger and better!
WOOOO MORE SMALL ANT AND ALPHARAD
I love it ❤
hi im smallant1
If possible, infinitely wet gushins in every kingdom for a Squid Race vid
At least you didn’t invite Eric (CrowPoint)
I bet you could retire next year with a very fat bank account if you published one of these every week. This is my way of saying this is GREAT stuff
Yo 48 thousand views in 30 min
FIRST HALF HOUR GANGGG
Why is nicro's chat so sus
How much more is excited to the next season of your favourite anime?
I love the constant uploads
Everything Crafty does defies the laws of reality
MORE HIDE AND SEEK LESSGOOO
thats more than 3
There are brazilians here but me?
I don’t even know 8 people
Very entertaining
Crafty is insane
Let’s go HIDE AND SEEK TIME WITH THE 8 BOIS
ive been waiting for your next hide and seek mainchannel video :}
WOOO! Fav thing for odd since the first speedruns.
Let’s go 8 ppl
Holy shit,  I haven't seen alpharad in years. Goddamn he looks different
13:59 I love the realization  26:58  also this
What is Crafty's Profile Picture???
nice
I thought hiders couldn’t use captures?
E
How is there 3 views and 54 likes
The hide and seek are the best.
smant have you ever thought that once the seekers leave the odyssey you should go in
"Are we giving him a youtube video?"
0 dislikes lol. SmallAnt W!!!! (I have an extension!!!!)
alpharad saying "are we giving him a youtube video" hits different
Why is no one hear
I'm gonna need the next episode to be gushin kart
It's crazy watching these after seeing them live like 3 weeks ago
Dude it’s actually crazy. Smant is so well rounded and fun to watch. His personality, skill, dedication, editing, streaming, it’s just all good lmfao. And anyone who can speedrun this much and still enjoy it, I salute you. Spending hours and hours on challenges, literally spending days doing them. I’ve done my fair share in speedrunning minecraft, SMO, and some other switch games, and it takes dedication to keep going. ❤️   Love these multiplayer/hide and seek vids with this set of content creators lol.
Crafty’s gotten pretty good
Hey smallant, can I be in one of these??
i love howalpharad is just give g back and forth and everybody is falling for it
Aw… when is 8 player speedrun co-op?
Crafty is cracked
whoa! double the amount of ppl than normal h&s
So this is the reason captures were banned when being chased. Always heard stories about how they banned caps in the chase, now I see why
My favorite series that u have ❤️
that is exactly what i need
14:00 yes, you are giving him a YouTube video😂😂
14:36 ofc an aussie wouldn’t get it
*sees video title in inbox*  Oh dude LET'S *GO!!!*
Now with Pointcrow and BOTW multi-player  Imagine Hide and seek in THAT
The squid chase will remain iconic and you just sat there and watched.
Smallant what if you go in the car subarea and break a car then hide inside of it.
TBH it’s better to watch live
WOOOHOO ANT UPLOAD
I've already seen this three times on other channels, I just want new hide and seek, nooooooo!
Been waiting for this one
Seeing eight people on 1 screen is so unbelievable
Oh shit it's happening!!!!
Finish subnautica
"are we giving him a youtube video"       *Canadian Speedrun Goblin noises intensify*
I already saw this on an other channel I think
When the smallant uploads 👀👀👀😳😳😳
It's so cool to see how many people still play mario oddesy
14:00 “Omg are we giving him a YouTube video” LMAO
e
SmallAnt’s upload consistency this week is pure dopamine
You finally upload more hide and seek content great
“Are we giving Smant a YouTube video?” Yes, yes you are.
SQUID RACE WE NEED IT AS A VID
Yes!!!! Hide n seek da best!
That manhunt on Nicro was gold!
Thank you for the more frequent uploads always enjoy your content
Oi
I love hide and seek mario
tfw you just watched this entire stream yesterday
yeeeee, I love seeing Crafty winning, he is my favorite.
Da squad is here bois
I was there for the chase and it was amazing
Whoo
Awsome
Let's goooo
These will never get old
this is a hit
Erly
five years and it's still going strong
this looks like so much fun 😂
when are you going to stop adding more people soon it will be 10
Chad
omg
Uploads are back, this is a good day
Smant, thank you for the consistent uploads. You've got some of my favourite content but because of college life I never have the opportunity to make it to the livestreams. This is a great way to relax in the evening.
Alpha had the best moon spot
POG
Always a great day with the gang uploads
8 player hide and seek 8 minutes ago uploaded, ah yes perfectly balanced
yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Times everyone has won:  Smallant: 6  Fir: 6  Poo:5  Cyja: 4  Crafty: 4  Lycel: 0  Alpharad: 0  Amethyst: 0  Nicro: 0  Failboat: 0  Fearsome Fire: 0   Feel free to correct me if I am wrong (also if players have won more games than I put then please tell me so I can update it)
wtf
This is siiiickkk
It's still insane that crafty managed to make multiplayer in SMO  Without crafty we wouldn't have these hide and seek videos
HI
how
Small ant you should do another lockout against 2 people or 3
0:20 mr nicro?!
I appreciate the grind man you CAN take a break!
Ah, Super Mario Odyssey Hide and Seek, or as I like to call it, "Ant finding a good spot and deciding to be Icarus and killing himself before being found"
Ok

I remeber watching this live 2 months ago
this is one of the reasons i love modding communities, you have an incredible base game and then the creativity and skill of the people who make these mods turn a 5 year old game into fresh content
I wish I as at this steam looks so fun to view live
