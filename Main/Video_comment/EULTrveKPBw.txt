Who else thought they were watching the World Cup qualifiers
Albainia are rubbish
Eddie should of had 6 goals.
Why is their an u21 team
With a goal record like that I should be more impressed by Eddie, but i'm not.
Nketiah and CHO have mediocre twin brothers that play in the EPL. The brothers that play for England are way better!!
Trying to get more views for games like this and they go with the same god awful commentators....
Commentators be like "Ya having a laugh mate"
Derby's Buchanan just quality glad to see our player in an England shirt doing well.
Who is this northern woman commentating? So harsh on everyone..The first goal "it's just a shocking error".  I've watched it about 20 times now and the shot was curling and hit with power, pretty hard for any keeper I would say.
England limbering up well for the African cup of nations
The home of football
I think these commentators need to be reminded their watching an under 21 match.
Keeper will be getting his p45 in the morning
Well done boys.
This commentator is having such a go at the Albanian team when it’s almost like a small nation is going against the country with some of the best academies in the world
Eeww a woman commentator...yuck
Having woman commentating has ruined the game  🤣🤣🤣🤣💔
The goalkeeper the defending her commentating that was painful viewing 🙈🙈🙈
Commentator is rubbish, very biased and rude to all the players he talks about, doesn’t give the players any confidence being spoken to like that
Are we sure, this is Albania under 21. They look like under 15, to me. 🤣
great goal by messi lingard!!!
Delete the keeper
This group of players is too talented for Southgates mediocre tactics. They should stick to under 21 level, will be better off.  England will need a far more superior and  top notch tactical manager, when these lot move on to the senior squad.
love Nketiah but how many misses? opportunities vs conversions not good
I think  this  is not  albenia  I think  Is  Afghanistan  .Albania  they  have  better  player's
Just England U21’s we seeing then? Typical lol.
Would love to see Paul dempsey in goal
am i the only who kept replaying CHO's ball in at 2:25 ?
Although I'm a Chelsea fan, is it just me or does CHO only score when GKs make errors?
I'm not trying to be funny but this keeper is playing against nketia and Hudson odoi how do they expect him to be a neuer he's against 2 of the best English youngsters in the prem
Hudson is moving mad
How horrid Henry still got a job at BT is crazy to me worst commentator I've ever heard surely!
Easy game for England. Our defence is useless.
Eddie needs to be promoted to the senior squad...incredible movement in the final 3rd, always alive even late on in games. Hudson-Odoi, C.Jones, T.Davies need to get promoted too. Blow everything up, get a Coach who will play the youngsters. Engand under Southgate, who showed promise at first, ain't going nowehre.
Who is the commentator, what a useless person.
BT Sport giving Horrid Henry a job as a commentator, so good of them, even cartoon characters are suffering in these troubled times
Hudson odi is leagues above anyone on that pitch and I’m a Liverpool fan, I believe he’s true class and a miles better better player than Rashford  as he makes stuff happen
Would this women commentator piss off already
Games like this are a waste of time.  Do we owe Albania or something. Joke.
Like wdum the commentator is so rude to a young goalie against England. He also saves a penalty and the commentator doesn't say anything 😡
Anyone else think that the commentators are terrible
Watched on mute after 30 seconds. To be fair I do the same for anyone that isn't Martin Tyler or Garry Neville...
Commentators need to shut up, being completely biased and need to understand the skill gap between these young players who have the opportunity to be as good as they are
jamal musiala didn't scuff his shot he chipped it this commentary is awful honestly
Commentator sounds like a right miserable bloke. The best in the world miss penalties, so what if the lad missed one. Talking about 'time for a little practise' as if he doesn't know how to take a penalty already.
Hudson odoi is a baller
my guy
Horrid Henry's propper jarring, IT'S TIME TO GO
people don’t understand that an 16-21 year old lad from this random country has been put up against england which normally have great youth players anyway and he’s still getting hate off for trying his hardest, the best he can do is get back into training and step up his game after every game
My pub team could of put six past this terrible opposition....
These commentators are terrible, idk how they got the job 😂
I love football highlights.. but this commentator makes it seriously hard work to get to the end of them..
Hudson-Odi bossed this game!
curtis jones is the best
musiala > bellingham
In the senior team and under 21’s England have so many good right backs
england u21 is better than first team
The Albanian team looks more English than the English team.  Sad to see.
Commentary seemed off , England only do well against lower level countries, play Germany they get whacked England
Nketiah is wack
Hudson Odoi, Nketiah, Jones, James, Buccanon. Quality
The fact that the likes of Bellingham, TAA, greenwood, foden,  James could theoretically all be playing for the under 21s I quite frankly a ridiculous amount of talent. Will still never win anything with the seniors mind 🙄
ca jan kta karat e shqipris..lozin si kurva...kalamaqet e mutit
Nketiah is a scoring machine
Sorry but albania were awful here. Not a care in the world.
Embarrassing what is the point in playing these bin men!
Both commentators should be sacked. Not fit for purpose - They are completely off the mark sometimes. Keeper wasn't even that bad, saving his team on multiple occasions, his outfield team were possibly much worse.. could have been 10-0. Literally not a gender issue either, man/woman/whatever they are were both terrible commentators.
CHO looking very sharp!
Had to watch this game on mute from how boring and dull the commentators were
During international break would rather see England v England u21s
Female commentator ... I turn off
Nketiah played decent don’t get me wrong, but he also has a lot to improve on, CHO was brilliant
How is a rubbish player like Nketiah getting so many goals? Has nothing worthwhile in his game, just a tap-in merchant. Had he been playing for Albania, he'd never score a goal.
Still baffles me how Arteta still picks Laca over Nketiah
I can never get used to dat voice it still gets me every time
That woman commentating is so boring shes just saying exactly whats happened like we are blind or something and cant  see
Where’s joe willock?
Nketiah is too wasteful. Needs 3/4 chances to score
Great game by hudson odoi but cant help but notice his desire to run as soon as the ball is in the box just goes and he stops running and pretty much stands still
Hudson Odoi running them Albanians ragged! Looked lethal every time he got the ball.
Shows BT take no notice of the comments on the amateurish co-commentating they have foisted on their viewers. How bl**dy awful she is!
Why does burna boy ye play after every england goal? 🤣
Great win
ayyyye burnaaa in the background
Token Wimmin commentators ruining football with their incessant screeching.
for all the goals Nketiah gets at this level, I don't know why I'm still not convinced about him. Hope he proves me wrong
Yeah commentary on this was embarrassing, absolutely no need to dig the goalkeeper out like that. They are a lesser nation skill-wise to England but this man is a professional footballer and kept the score down to 5 when it could have been a lot more. A bit more sense and sensitivity is required.
Horrid Henry is commentator
What is this defenders from Albania lol
Great performance and great commentary!
The Albos play football as a front 🤣
This commentator sounds like Jack from  Jamie Johnson
Honestly CHO is way too good for this
engafrica
Commentators seem to overlook just how great Hudson-Odoi was tonight. Lots of potential
Arsenal should give Eddie a start for a few games couldn't be any worse than lacazzette
It's the Burna Boy 🎵 for me after every England goal 💪🏿
Nketiah had a poor one ngl.
An easy game for England. It's not a surprise that they won against Albania.
Cuz of the under 21 in the thumbnail i thought it was 15-0
Why is the young prospect Jesse lingard not starting for the u21?
Eze????
Callum’s on fire 🔥 your defence was terrified
Hudson odoi needs tor start for The first team.
CHO isnt u21 level he needs to be back in the first team
Derby's Lee Buchanan.... Fantastic young wing back...
This seems to easy for callum hudson
Hudson-Odio should go out on loan to prove his worth, he’s quality
Difficult to listen to with the commentary.
Hudson Odoi remind me of Hazard cutting in from that LW. Chelsea need to play him there though.
Please get new commentators
A full season in the championship will do Nketiah good. He has talent but is clearly not at the level that Arsenal need.
That Albanian goal keeper has the worst positioning I’ve ever seen in my life.
This woman has no idea what she's on about 🤣
Ngl I hate the commentator Not one but of praise given to anyone, Hudson-Odoi's goal was ignored, The gk's save was ignored All he wanted to do was criticise
Shocking shooting & defending.
Love Justin miss him at Luton
*Albananian keeper looks like he’s playing pro clubs*
6:34 can this guy stfu Jesus Christ don’t see him playing for England
Also Hunger and Desire
I thought 15-0 💀
that keeper is the worst I’ve ever seen
I don’t hate this commentator because she’s a woman, I hate her because she’s annoying
Commentator needs to relax
Paul Dempsey is such a miserable man. The first goal was a powerful, curling shot from Hudson-Odoi which an 18-year-old Albanian keeper will likely have problems with. Yet at no point does he say anything about Hudson-Odoi, only "horrible, horrible attempt" and "no wonder he feels sorry for himself" in his grating, sandpaper-like voice.
Bt has the worst commentary
Same thing will happen, England WILL fail to deliver in next summers U21 European championships...as per the norm
Watched for 30 seconds then had to take my earphones out, I can’t listen to that woman commentate, she’s so annoying, same things and mispronunciations of names over and over again, please BT bite the bullet and move on
Both commentators just awful !
Did better than 1st team
Well played the African away team
I see a couple of white men in that unders Africa side - progression as Diversity is our strength. Oy vey. Shalom.
me as an arsenal fan nd caring more about musiala lol
nketiah shows to never give up
Some terrible commentary
No 9 could of had 5 goals easily
The number 9 should have had 5 or 6 goals imo
That goalkeeper reminds me of a pro keeper on pro clubs 🤣
I’m an Arsenal fan but have to admit Hudson odei is twice the player nketiah is
Another game watched with the TV volume turned down, couldn't stand the co-comms banal rambling.
Nketiah 1-6yrds out = Lethal Nketiah 7yrds+ out = Woeful
Why is it Tom davies last competitive match
6:35 That's the worst encroachment I've ever seen
Shameful performance by albania
greenwood should get called up if southgate don’t want him on the first team
As an arsenal fan nketiah played awful could of easily got 6 goals and still got 2

Years 2055 and nketia is still scoring in the u21’s team
Honestly looks like playing these easy U21 games makes the players more used to have lots of chances and makes them more wasteful
So what does this result prove then like the seniors they have to win tournaments until they do this is meaningless.
Safe to say Albania ain’t making an international for a whike
Why does the commentator sound like a 10 year old boy?
This why Albania will never have a good team, instead of playing talented youths they got the mayors or directors disabled sons playing instead €€€€
Buchanan is a problem !!!
CHO looking like he getting his pre injury form back
Musiala looks like a real tournament
Nketiah is so overrated
Hudson Odoi just needs to work on his end product , his shots seem to never go in the corners. But other than that great youngster.
Hudson odoi looks great
England U21 VS East London U21
England U beat Albania U21's 215 nil😱
EDDIE EDDIE EDDIE. If he keeps it up he'll be a star in the next couple of seasons
Women commentators just ain't it
Pause it on 6:27 how has that not been retaken
Great performance 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 this team it was another level tonight! If they want to play maybe can score more than 10 goals
all right the keeper had a rough game but this commentator is proper gunning for him. Like hes being unnecessarily harsh imo hes a really young lad playing against England
Eddie is so underrated kmt
How horrid Henry still got a job at BT is crazy to me worst commentator I've ever heard
Last ever England game for Davies I'd say he won't get in the 1st England team
No eze😭😭
Women’s commentator? They have their own leagues, why can’t she do that?
that ‘shocking error’ would be a great attempt in womens football
CHO is too good for this level wavy baller
Hudson Odoi running the show 🔝🔝🔥
Our Lee Buchanan, so proud of the lad
Nketiah the poacher. Much better than kane imo
Good to see Hudson Odoi get his confidence back and people gotta be patient he’s recently turned 20 and with competition and world class Chelsea teammates he’ll succeed
Iv never seen as many mustafi's and adrian's in one match
Should have been 10-0
CHO is miles above U21 level too easy for him
Decent performance but Nketiah still lacking that killer instinct. If he had his shxt together he would be leaving the game with 5 not 2
I can’t stand the female commentator not because she is female just because she has no idea what she is talking about
Another episode of Horrid Henry
What a terrible striker nketiah is misses 10 and scores 1  And sitters are that always!
Eddie will be someone who really finds his feet soon in the senior team.. some players just get through later than others. Just look at Gnabry.. Vardy. He certainly won't lose his goal scoring instincts, he can only get better in improving his tactical awareness, passing and athletic abilities which will come with experience.
James Justin 🐐
Nketier scores for England but does not score for arsenal it’s clear why what’s behind him is ghosts
Qia robt o shok ne hajm fasule me pilaf
Great performance from the two Ghanaian ballers again CHO and nketiah 🇬🇭
6:27 🤔
I’m hoping Musiala will become a great player for England. Done well to score for one of the best teams in europe
Commentators doing my head in
Remember when Arsenal fans said that Nketiah was better than Greenwood🤣🤣
They say Enland i will like to know how many of them are they really British;)).They roods from different nation..hahaha
Lee Buchanan 😍
Nketiah is so inconsistent and wasteful. hell never make it at arsenal. In a few years hell be coming off the bench for stoke
*RING RING*
How people still think Martinelli and Saka are better than CHO is beyond me.   What a player🙌🙌
Headlines tomorrow: Young Lions tipped to conquer Europe and the World, after the demolition of a very tough and formidable opponent in Albainia.
Commentators name is Karen lol
The woman commentator is so annoying , adds in irrelevant input
The woman’s voice is so annoying , anyone else ?
Nketiah scores in dead games and never scores when it matters in the Prem. Nonetheless, I wish him all the best.
Is that a pro clubs keeper?
Nketiah couldve had 5 😭
CHO is just too good for U21
U21s would smash Southgates senior team.
Nkietah could have had 4
The penalty should have been retaken - the defender who cleared it after the save was miles inside the box when the ball was struck!
Great performance from Lee Buchanan, big future ahead for him
We should win the u21 Euros
1:48 "What a strike that is, by AJ Tracey!!"
Future stars
God I’ve seen Sunday league teams with a better keeper and back line
CHO is like CR7 of this team everyone feeds him the ball and he does the rest
How is nketiah england u21s all time top scorer ?😂😂😂🤦‍♂️
What happened to Nketi-A  Edit: Nvm, it slipped out at 4:10
Hungar and desire - Horrid Henry
Lets go
Bloody hell Albania defending and their goalkeeper are awful
Jjj
Ballers🙌🥶
Their keepa reminds me of adrian
Albania Here Well played to England
CHO future star
d1verscity IZ JEN 0 SIDE
Alexandre Lackofthreat is shaking in his boots looking at Nketiahs performances
Rip Albania
Eddie call me 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
CHO🔥
First
COME ON ENGLAND
