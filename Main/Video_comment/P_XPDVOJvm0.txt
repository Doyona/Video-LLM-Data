He could really could've put this song Mandela on his one album that he did flamerz 5 then that's when it would've been the best on the billboard but he didn't though cause they was saying that It was 11$ dollars of his 10th anniversary  Of his dreams and nightmares of his career.

Jesus the one way but there might be more than one way to Him... Meek will find his way to truth in Him, I believe that.
Keep it coming meek 🟢
this is beautiful to see. "took them bars that they gave me & I made it a rap; took them cells that they gave us & I made it a plaque." Meek overcoming HIS circumstances makes me proud & inspired myself, just like he probably wants for us
This is one of those songs that are very under appreciated. Shit like this should be at 100 million views rn.
I like the flow vibing
this why drake aint drop yet...  meek keep bombing out here
Why does everything meek do come off as corny??

If I was into symbolism. I would think meek is illuminati or a mason.,🤔🤔🤷
Holy bible nigga💯🔥
Meek sizzling keep it coming
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋

Meek out here... Street to conscious talk...
A quick inspiration - Nothing that has happened to you is a surprise to God. God’s hand is always on you. He’s ordering your steps. If the door is closed, it was supposed to be closed. If the person walked away, they were supposed to walk away. Don’t get upset, keep moving forward. God has already worked the situation out. He has something greater in store for you. Declare by faith, “it is  already done” 💕🎆.
meek mill has never been to south Africa so he don't know shit about the history

MY PRAISE REPORT:MY NAME IS TYRIQUE LINDSAY AND I AM 22 YEARS OLD BORN MARCH 16 1999 FROM PINES VILLAGE FL. I WAS IN MY HOUSE ALONE AND I HAD 20 BUCKS ON ME. INSTEAD OF DOING SOMTHING STUPID I WENT TO DOLLAR TREE AND GOT SOME PEDEYLITE APPLE JUICE NOODLES AND A TOOTH BRUSH AND WALKED HOME .  IM WALKING DOWN 69 AND I SEE A TEEN SLEEPING ON THE FRONT YARD WITH NO PHONE. SO I STOP THE SHOPING CART AND GAVE HIM ONE OF MY PEDYALITE AND TOLD HIM ITS BETTER THAN GATERRADE! WHICH IT IS! AFTER I GAVE IT TO HIM HE SAID THANKS AND I SAID GOD BLESS AND WENT HOME! I KNOW GOD SEE MY HEART! 777

Damn meek I still remember kd leaving 2 gsw too
FUEGO!
❤🖤💚👊
This is inspiring to me as a young black African American
No one in South Africa celebrate Lucky Dube, true legends are forgotten, it's really sad. Black History is forgotten. Everyday I see people from all over the world remembering him under comments of his songs. We never celebrate our own, but when it comes to legends of a different race, we make sure that we celebrate them. RIP to all SA legends, Black legends! May the young generation celebrate them better than this generation.
Meek don't get the credit he deserves
Right now they are convincing South Africans that Nelson Mandela sold the country to erase Black History. Tata is no longer respected, remembered or celebrated in the country he was born. Good thing his legacy lives on abroad.

GREAT INSPIRATION ^ONCE AGAIN MOST DESERVED #AMEN
Hello, I just wanted to tell you about a message I think everyone should hear.. It's the Gospel. This is not an attack❤. So basically it's the real life story between God and man and how sin separates and puts man at enmity with God and how without a saviour there is eternal separation from Him. Sin separates us from God because he is like no other. He is not corrupted by sin nor can he ever commit sin. The separation between the God of the universe and man because of sin should be troubling to only us as humans but it also was something God was displeased with too. God loved us so much ,being his creation, that he sent his son( his son is himself, God is only one God but has three persons in him..it's hard to explain but realize that his son is God) to die for us. So, Jesus(the son) lived a perfect life with no sin even though he experienced many temptations. He then died willingly on the cross for us, taking on all our sins so that we could be seen as blameless and holy in God's eyes if we believe in Jesus and what he did. Mind you the crucifixion(cross)was the most humiliating and painful death at the time and he being God went through it for OUR punishment because of OUR sins needing to be taken away. He then resurrected after three days conquering sin/death once and for all. If someone believes and trusts in Jesus then their sins have been washed clean and they have eternal life with their creator, God! Through faith anyone can obtain these things and even more, but the best thing you get as a believer is God himself. But I won't lie and say that being with Jesus is easy. You do have to follow him. There will be at some points heartache, sacrifice for him, picking up your burdens and many other things that are not the most convenient. (He gives us strength and healing in our situations for his glory so you are not alone bearing those burdens) But Remember that the God who created everything including you,  died for you because he desired to be with you FOREVER. Your creator desired us so we should definitely want him too.(if you do come to God because of this, know that confessing your sin to God will allow God to cleanse you of your sins, this isn't a license to sin but God's forgiveness/grace in action)
Legendary Flow Boy Still Got it

We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9
This man a savior🥶

Love was a man who was nailed through his Wrists & Feet into a cross before that he was whipped & beaten and wore a crown of thorns, he committed no crime or sin,but he loved you so much he made a way for us sinners to come to repentance through Jesus! his blood was paid to use for our sins, for those who believe in him & who receive them as their Lord & savior, his name is  Jesus Christ! Do you know him? † He loves you so very much! Also remember Death couldn’t hold Jesus  down! God rose Jesus Christ up from the dead on the third day! Jesus defeated death! Jesus is alive & retuning back one day soon, are you ready to meet him? 🙌🏻🖤  Jesus Loves You, Don’t Forget To Pray! He Is Here To Help You! cast All Your burdens to him! He cares. I Hope You Have An Amazing Day 🖤🙌🏻 - John 14:6 King James Version 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

Being happy in this world is impossible. There are disorders, sickness, crime, death, hunger, and climate issues. However, this is temporary. Why does this exist you may ask? The devil tested Adam and Eve, and they betrayed God by eating the forbidden fruit. Imagine, a creator who creates things and out of love gives them free will. That is a choice. He did not make robots or people to suffer. Sadly, the devil or satan was a jealous angel who wanted to be worshiped. He is a narcissistic spirit who planted his seed here on earth. He wanted humans to worship him and not God. Adam and Eve hurt God. He only asked one thing, and that is to not eat the forbidden fruit. God could have destroyed the devil but, then what would all the angels in heaven think? The devil called god a liar by saying our ancestors would not die. All the angels were watching and the penalty for betraying god is death, and because we are born in sin, we are imperfect. Genesis 3:1-13 "Then the serpent said to the woman, You will not surely die. For God knows that on the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil." Knowledge is power, and what is a narcissistic person, a person who wants power to be worshiped. Jesus was tested by the devil. He did not deny that the devil is currently ruling this earth when he was tested. However, Satan's time on earth is short because of what happened. You are probably asking what happened? You see, Jesus is God's only begotten son, who died for our sins and was resurrected three days later out of death. What does it mean for Jesus to die for our sin? It means that he is loyal to God and did not succumb to the narcissistic spirit that our Perfect Ancestors did Adam and Eve. That is right, both perfect people were tested by the devil and Jesus prevailed, even-though our ancestors did not. Jesus performed miracles such as curing the lame, sick, disabled and raising people from the dead because of his humble loving, loyal spirit to God, and not being tempted by power, greed, and unclean natural practices. Jesus is our king and is ruling in heaven, but he will come down to earth, and raise the dead, and judge both the living and the dead. Praise Jah or  hallelujah or praise Jehovah. You may ask who is Jehovah? He is the creator of all things, the highest living god. His name is Jehovah. What do you think hallelujah means in your bible, and when people sing the song? It means to praise Jehovah our god or Praise Jah.  When people sing hallelujah, they are saying praise Jah or praise Jehovah. The Hebrew Bible hallelujah is actually a two-word phrase, not one word. The first part, hallelu, is the second-person imperative masculine plural form of the Hebrew verb hillel.[1] However, "hallelujah" means more than simply "praise Jah" or "praise Yah", as the word hallel in Hebrew means a joyous praise in song, to boast in God.[10][11]    The second part, Yah, is a shortened form of YHWH, the name for the Creator. The name ceased to be pronounced in Second Temple Judaism, by the 3rd century BC due to religious beliefs.[12] The correct pronunciation is not known, however, it is sometimes rendered by Christians as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah". The Septuagint translates Yah as Kyrios (the LORD), because of the Jewish custom of replacing the sacred name with "Adonai", meaning "the Lord".  If you want to know more about what the bible says, please direct message me and we can set up a time to talk.  Here is a link to what God's name actually is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah If you have anymore questions please contact us at https://www.jw.org/en/

This song not only fire, but it has a great message behind it. 10/10.

Dope freestyle
Another classic 🤲🏽
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
BIG MEEK 💪🏽

👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥🥵, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me.

My favorite rapper meek mill always on point respect to you Big G
Rip Lil Snupe
Hello everyone I just wanted to let you know that Jesus Christ loves you and He is patiently waiting for you to submit to Him before it is too late. I am so thankful because in my past there were situations that happened to me that could have destroyed me forever and God saved me from it all. He made  me realize that the way I was living and what I was choosing to be influenced by was only leading me to hell. I know for sure I am still here because of His mercy on my soul and His forgiveness, now I can help others get closer to Him. I encourage you all to repent of your sins, give your life fully to Jesus Christ and turn away from the evil and idolatry of this world it will only lead you to hell and you do not want to go there. Make that change right now while you still have time, follow The LORD in all that you do, and keep His commandments always. You will not regret this decision because when it is all over your eternity will be final and forever. God bless you and your families please be safe and take care much love 💕

There is little to no freedom in this country. Meek Mill is an example of that. But these are fighting words that resonate with everyone that’s being affected. And trust me, all of us are being targeted. I have faith we will rise up 👊🏽
Dam this is the type of vibes we need if we truly want to change the system 🔥

Why the thumbnail look like he's whacked the f*** out
Yes
Meek my name is Robert too
That’s dope and the song was fire . More music with substance less shoot’em up kill your own kind songs . Because music  sets the tone for  your emotions . For our people we feed off the energy  in the music good or bad . So let’s change and put positive vibes and let’s see what happens . Because we do the kill kill since the 80’s and we’ll we see the results. Congratulations Meek
meek mill been that dude since the street battling with the dreads, that was prime meek mills with a sicko flow, just like you and just like me.
Why people hyping the fact he’s rapping about his life 🤦🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️ it’s not corny but it is basic. Meek the only rapper who fans don’t say we want that old meek back because he never transition into a different flow. Same 1234 1234
Luv from South Africa

Hottest shit I heard all year
Yea meek talk ur shit all I been waiting 4‼️🖋
yeah meek is an amazing rapper that sold his soul and he is telling u clearly, no hiding.  selling ur soul means you are willing to lead ur people down the hellfire for a seat at satan's table.  when McDonalds hires ur goofy ass, can u change the menu cuz u don't like what they selling? hell no, meaning, meek a great rapper but he can't change the menu, he sold his soul for all the irrelevant shit it comes with.
Meek Milli.. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.. the growth in his flow.. you can see his Crown!!!!! King Shit!!!!!!

They are programming you with music , if things still are not clear that all these famous people are devil/Egyptian worshippers , you have a bigger surprise coming soon. And even your trends are evil like calling him the Goat 🐐 , All the goats”  like you call him, are the ones heading for hell in the Bible . Stop being a follower and following evil and turn from your wicked way and ask Jesus Christ into your life so you won’t die eternally

Best rapper in the biz
* God's grace *  Did you know that God loves you so much that he sent Jesus to save us? Jesus is the son of God! And he loves you very much! To have proof of this, we can say that he emptied himself of all his glory and stepped on the earth! Isn't that wonderful? And there's more! He assured us of salvation! He fulfilled the mission that God gave him! Which is to have a death on the cross for all people in the world! * How do I get to heaven? * It's very simple! -Accept Jesus as your Lord and only Savior! - Repent of your sins daily even those you don't know because you sinned out of ignorance! -Recognize that you do not deserve God's salvation but even with your faults He wanted to save you with his great love and grace! Now about keeping your faith -Read the Bible daily -Pray and fast -Go to a church that follows the word of God  May God bless you greatly! 👋

Whoever came here 4hrs later..... Just like this 😉 I represent DC. Day one ☝️
I'm a very proud South African but I will always prefer American Rap Music over South African rap, not because Americans are better but American rappers like Meek use their music to highlight the plight of their communities. Here by us rappers are calling Nelson Mandela Nelly M and are afraid to rap against the nonsense that our government is subjecting us to
He did it again 🔥
When did this dude ever get a haircut

MEEK MILL REAL FREE MASON        The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) considered as the most knowledgeable person talked about a False Messiah that would come upon the world to misguide the guided and wreak havoc. Dubbed as the ‘Anti-Christ’, the False Messiah is known as Dajjal.  For every Muslim, the first and foremost belief in Islam is that there is no God but Allah Almighty and Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) was his final messenger. After him, nobody else would come to guide the world towards the right path, his demise meant the end of Prophet-hood.  dajjal Source: liverostrum.com  Hints suggest that Dajjal would come out in the open before Akhirat, which means the Day of Judgement. Even his name, in Arabic, means deception. Dajjal’s motive in the world would be to take as many people away from Allah’s correct path as he can. The deceiver’s arrival is also stated in Christianity, Jewism, and is a vital part of Islam.  The Holy Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) told his Muslim brethren that a False Messiah would come and misguide our people. While others haven’t been able to put a face on Dajjal, Holy Prophet gave a very definite description of how Dajjal would look. His description of Dajjal is absolutely clear, unlike any other existing scripture.    Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) called Dajjal Al-Awar, “one with blind one eye” — in detail, he said that Dajjal’s right eye would be like a floating grape, shaking, not fixed in one position. Dajjal’s left eye would also be defective and green in color. The Prophet said that Dajjal’s complexion would be “Reddy-White” — like people from England, North, Scotland or elsewhere.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Any South African🇿🇦 in the comment section? I used to hate Meek because I am Drake's fan. I swear I missed a lot but thank to Going Back.
Peace, power, and love. Control your reality. Alter your destiny. Believe in your imagination. Create your world. Love yourself. Honor nature. I am.
All Meek needs to do now is grow his braids back out...I'm buying his next project on CD just to give me 2008 vibes... this is 🔥 🔥🔥
Dream Chasers 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Dajjal being blind in his right eye while being sharp and oversized in his left, for example, is indicative of being devoid of religious insight and spiritual understanding, but excellent in material and scientific attainment.
HONOR MANDELA WITH EYES OF LUCIFER BAPTHOMET BLACK IN USA ARE CRAZY FREE MASON

Mad Love from South Africa.
Wow!!!! Dude you're from America and here in RSA we'd admire you as one of the TOP American rappers but with this project. No words can describe the way I feel about our country now cz clearly the world is watching... Thank you broh; you can laugh about it but it really feels good to be recognised by an American if you're an African.   We love Meek Mill. I'm buying this freestyle now.
Since j Cole and Nas dropped,,,game been difficult,,,
Go crazy blood
Mandela's name was tarnished when they associated it with this brother. Criminal reform, really???? He exploited the system for himself. All I ever hear this brother do is  brag and boast on Ghetto youths about what he got and they  DON'T have. Now he is some criminal reform Don, really ???
Meek Mandela is KING

To me I feel Meek when he spit But he been to Africa? Did he see kids over there eating dirt of the ground? I feel like it's "trending" to talk about injustice in the motherland and still go cop mansions and jewelry worth millions. Yo Meek u know that u could save a whole lot of starving kids in Africa with just One of them chains. Get it right and DO right! I've been there cause I got family out there and me and my parents and wife try to help as much as we can!
Can't look at this guy the same after that 6ix9ine incident

The Eye of Horus?🤔....Wow!..Ok Meek!🙄
Love Meek one of the greats 💖👑🤴🏾
Am guessing this is the new hustle to pretend to be conscious while doing otherwise 🤔
What's the fight for?  We have travelled and come a far way but still distant Forgetting the fight for peace and unity  Indulging more into an abyss in alone some Plunging more away at our roots and leaving us With nothing to stand on but standing alone No longer standing strong but firm in an illusion We keep forgetting the past Those that were slaves, maids and masters It's coming to nothing and I am caught being a victim   Just like the lands of this world, we started drifting slowly and surely shredding our parts We have become more divided while looking secretly more ways to mend l The above is a joke I might add When is the next earthquake so I can feel the tremor and say, that's who causing our terror But is it? Or are we just always looking for a goat to escape on?  The future we are fighting towards is nothing but pale and sweet in an instance Forgiveness is no longer a fair chance We keep taking steps forward or at least supposedly It seems more like we have a bad sense of direction We changed course and it wasn't mentioned or even that obvious but we are moving along for satisfaction  Our roots are no more, our pride is too high It's hard to regain those heights of the top shelf The greatness we embodied and was buried Our base is completely demolished  Nothing left but our polished insecurities  Inspired by all the black freedom fighters  © Makonnen Solomon  #newwritings #JamesWhyte

I see meek I click   “Can you believe in the land of the free I’m fighting for freedom”   At this point if you hating on Meek two things are for sure… you’re a hater or you have 69 blood which means you aren’t really about that life. Meek comes from the streets but he made it out and just speaks real shit. Only real ones can relate… it’s that simple.
