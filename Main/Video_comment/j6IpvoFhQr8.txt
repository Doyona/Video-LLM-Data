It's been called a haymaker for probably over a hundred years.
Winging a no look over hand right. Looks alot like a few UFC fighters I know.
Space Haymaker
Overhand punch
Ufc sucks…. This is better.
Did he just call that man Pythagorean theorem
The Inherent  problem might be the distance traveled in an arc. A straight punch thrown at the exact same time will strike it’s target far sooner than an arching strike.  The strategy of this loping overhand strike is to use it when the defender is already retreating or is otherwise too mentally preoccupied to see the strike coming. Speed and timing are the consistent variables in striking an opponent. Not fast speed necessarily, but the appropriate speed based upon the opponents habit of “blocking” rapidly at every strike or feint.

That is not karate, where is your honor when you hit a fallen warrior.
Thats type of strike is not allowed in combat karate.   Unless they have changed the rules at some point
That's the best way to throw it!
The old mark hunt...... head down swing for glory
You have some people that learned all their  techniques of fighting in a dojo. You also have some people come into the dojo that have been in fights before they started training.those people who been in fights before already have timing , and the aggression to win.
Literally nobody throws a baseball like that.
That's an overhand right lol no baseball pitch
Over hand FALCON punch 🥊
Commonly referred to as the haymaker
“Karate overhand!”
Something tells me you’ve never seen a single baseball game in your life.
great technique, great athlete
Hail mary
pitchers never take their eye off the target.   this dude was lucky to land the punch but i'll take luck over experience any day
Age uke is the one skill people who compete don't train, because most experience fighters don't downward techniques from the jodan such as haymakers, doward hammerfist, downward backfists, shomen uchi, yokomen uchi, axe kicks, and rolling thunder kicks.
Doesn't change the fact that I've suffered for a witch not to live.
Don't cut it so close to the start next time..  it makes the video trash
Where was the karate? Lol what a joke.
Like bumfights.
Watchu know bout that over the top baseball hit
Thats an overhand lol. Very effective and many times they dont see it coming.
Fedor perfected that punch
In Brazil we call that "wingless dove" hahahahaha
The Man
Was that even a karate punch lol
I believe back in the day that was called a haymaker.
That could have been an easy check hook counter folled by a lipto the left the dude that got clocked didnt want to fight look at his stace before he got KO
His guard was way low.i don't think his was a black belt.awsome strike tho.
I never understood why would they let them keep beating on them some more after an obvious knock down. It happens too much in MMA. It's totally different if it's a knock down and the fighter is obviously able to get up and keep fighting, but I've seen time after time. Huge knock downs to the point that the fighter is out, and here comes the other fighter full of adrenaline throwing more sucka punches in the face just to prove they can land more severe punches while the other fighter is defenseless.
If the pitcher was a girl then ya
TOMAHAWK CHOP! 1
Damn, .. that white boy threw that right arm as though he was baseball pitcher Goose Gosssge! 😁👍
It’s called an overhand right lol
All these out of work fight specialists on YouTube.
I wonder how long will it take to make this sport more humane.  Dude kept hitting after causing a severe brain concussion. I love MMA but this is disgusting.. Bruce Lee only video of him fighting was with sparring gear. He wasn't blood thirsty he just liked martial arts.  The mob like the blood bath and the brain damage otherwise there would be more protection for fighters.
Close your eyes look at the ground and throw that overhand right
Overhand
OVER RIGHT HAND
The person posting this video doesn't watch baseball either
Actually he didn't... He swung it like a woman fighting
A defense I have to work on. Swarming is another attack many have trouble defending against.
It's just a overhand right hook, not what I was expecting going by the title of the video
A decently crafted fighter would have thrown a counter left hook. Will catch that looping right punch perfectly
Lucky punch.. When you throw haymakers and they land, they are devastating! But if you look close, he put his head down and dropped his guard briefly during that wild swing. A good counterpuncher would love that type of opening, especially if someone kept throwing that punch so they could time their counter..
One of my favorite punches. I'm only 5'6" but I've dropped a couple big guys with that one. Even to my surprise. 😉
Strike 3 you're out 😁😁😁
Not karate
This Is not a karate punch
Being a shorter person, i have taken to use what i call a "chuck lidell overhead"   It lands, more so than some less conventional strikes, on the grounds that people dont expect it
Damn I felt that punch through my phone. Lmao
That ref let that s*** go way too long to dude was out after the first punch.
Nothing like an overhand
Those saying that it is not traditional karate probably know karate just from the movies. it is not precisely executed, but it is a very traditional move, used often, for example, by Kokubun in competition (at a very different skill level).
Keep your hands up!!!!
This is not karate, come on
Just an overhand
The drunken bar attack!
That was like a last second reversal from Tekken.
Not sure what’s more shocking- that completely ridiculous punch or the fact that it had enough power to knock someone out.
That noise tho 👊💣💥🤯
It's called an overhand right
I had to watch that a couple of times
I guess that's what the X block in the forms is for. the over hand is so quick and powerful. Like a bat. Step away or x block it. It should be used by more fighters. Peace
Ah yes, very traditional punch.
That was a nightclub punch
"Karate"
Greatly underestimated, unexpected, the right wild overhand punch often lands and most often causes a KO when it did land well. Not looking pretty, but surely effective.
I would love to know the name in japanese of this
