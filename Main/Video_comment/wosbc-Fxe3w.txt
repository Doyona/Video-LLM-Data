Did you guys make sure to drain the 7 year old gas from the tank?
Y'all didn't leave the 7 year old fuel in the gas tank did you?
This project definitely convinced me MATT DAD AND CREW are the best 👌🏿 👍🏿 🇧🇧
To be honest im watching this videos only because of ur Dad😂
Felt inspiring from start to finish, loved it.
Good work
wow
The happiness when it started 🥹 Amazing job!
What year?
Ur so lucky to be able to work with your dad. Cherish it , I wish mine was around 😢❤❤❤. Love ur vids
You should dry ice clean the engines when you pull them out.
Zac❤❤
love it!
Have watched many of your videos and by far that oil o ring job you did was the cheekiest I have ever seen you do! What happens when high oil pressure? What  if you somehow blocked or partially blocked oil flow into one of those heads by installing in like that?  Oh well hope it works for you.
💥🤘🤘🤘
Where do you get the outro music from
Spey said the government would not allow the sale of any of its 😂cgi and I have a feeling they will be able to sell the whole 🎉rtr in a couple weeks and we r in the r word so they are going to be in a few months to see if they will sell the car 🚗 or not even though they will have a car to sell to buy and then sv Gab Veg  to sell   😊😊

Ein Liebe für deine freude
Wie lange soll euer Gefusche halten!!!😂😂😂
You and your dad are legends 👍
Your persistence is insane. Respect.
I DONT KNOW ABOUT HWBT!!!! I THINK WSNH IS MORE APT ON THIS ONE WORK SMART NOT HARD!! It's cool mat m8 I often found in my early days on the spanners learning by your mistakes is one of the best ways to learn!! And a v12 with 48 valves think u and Tony smashed it considering it came in kit form leaving out 2 o rings is a minor!!sounds sick bro & I bet it goes like a stabbed rat 😊👌👌👌❤
Dad dance, love it
OMG that brought a tear to my eyes, how great was that when it finally started. fantastic work by the team. absolutely loved watching this build (mind you i love them all). keep up the great videos your all amazing
Beautifully made exhaust system.
No shortcuts!
This is so wholesome to watch, unreal job lads
Top lance armstrong
17:21 so you did not finished compression test?
10:21  what
This thing is a hunk of junk 🤣
do you ever just stand on top of your V12? Yeah me too
I love your dad! Can't stress this enough! He's like a SUNSHINE in your darkest days! And in this shot, he literally pops out like a sun!!
Hi Matt, I love how you and your father work and have fun together, it's a super cool feeling
Lee genuinely had the first start lol 😂
Hi Mat,  I’ve just watched you start the Murcielago with tears in my eyes. I’ve been watching you since seeing Yorkshire Car Restorations started bringing your E24 back from the dead. It is coming along really well.  I am gradually working my way through your playlists so I can catch up to the current projects. I started watching you at a pretty low and dark point in my life after the guy who called himself my ‘best friend’ set me up and left me to deal with all his business debts from the last 4 years.   No, I’m not going to ask you for any money, there are processes for dealing with that stuff. However, I am going to thank you for the lift you have provided to me. I have gone from spending all day in bed thinking about ‘the end’ to getting back to working with some people, building their web site, Facebook page and planning out their marketing. Not something I have any experience at. I would not have done this without the inspiration you have provided.   Your humility, despite what looks like phenomenal success, and willingness to ‘have a go’ despite your lack of specific training and your heartfelt encouragement to others to do the same is truly remarkable. I know this hasn’t simply fallen into your lap, I’ve seen some of the times you have been working, despite some significant setbacks, yet you take it all in your stride and just get on with it.  Congratulations on your success and may it continue for many years to come.  Cheers, Bernie “Down Under”
Bro the moment when the engine came on was so fkcin exiting😂❤❤❤
Sheer unbridled joy on faces 🎉
Wow ❤
My first time watching your videos. The joy on your face when it fires up for the first time. Can tell it's been a labour of love
That was like waking a beast from a deep sleep. So cool.
You people understand yous are paying for all this everthing the Rolxies the cars it all and yous get not an been lmao now thats feckin funny an i bet this comment will be taking down asap funny i havent said anything out of place just the truth
This is partially due to a bad tune, the knock sensor on the block should be picking up it knocking due to lower octane and will retard the timing and reduce boost. I bet this sensing capability was disabled during tuning.
Doing it right is often quicker.
Big fan of your Videos more love from 🇰🇪
Love seeing the relationship you and your dad have! The shared joy is amazing. 😊
Amazing start, felt like I was their with you guys. Best car you tube channel. Great work.
I love your job as you are so passionate and patient.  Sending Love to your family and massive positive energy ❤️🙏 Especially love your dad and he is fabulous smiles ❤️😁
You are the best YouTuber and I hope you will buy another car like this
W dad W mat love the energy & vibe. god blesd you guys
14:05 was such a bait. Holy
Fault Lambo O ring lol😂
When the motor is cold the oil preasure should be arround 6 bar. When its hot arround 4 bar.
What if you would of used couple different apps to measure the Hz frequency on each of the lads phones present on site, and then see how much of a difference you'd get from all your measurements? Could have then averaged all measurements out at the end of all measurements taken and if not happy with overall differences in results, just get a calibrated duda device to measure that frequency more accurately 🙈
Great videos Mat. I knew the car looked familiar too - checked my photos from a driving experience day many moons ago and it turns out my mate drove your Lambo!
Shortcuts never pay off
Amazing work
When your Dad stands by your side when your all grown up, sky's the limit!  You can literally make impossible possible!! Love the joy at the end. Best from Toronto Canada
Your Dad is a legend!!! We need a t-shirt dedicated to the old man!!
I love how huge the engine and trans are
I found myself smiling when the engine was being started 😊, well done Mat! Armstrong indeed
Well done Mat!!!! The dragon is reborn! Epic!!! What a phenomenal sound! Regards from South Africa bud.
It reminded me of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang with those smoke rings and the sound of it trying to turn over
15:18 no Yfood for your dad? 😆
I shouted  “come on, engine!!!!”
the v12 when it started it just screamed "I AM BACK BABY"
I realy enjoy it😍 love to see your faces when it starts, your father is awesome like you😊
Abandoned but not really Abandoned
Only found this channel a week ago and I’m pretty sure I’ve watched near enough every build. What a YouTuber Matt is and I can’t say how much I enjoy the videos.   Your old man’s laugh cracks me up everytime! Keep the videos coming ❤
Mat you’re a legend I’m fairly new to the channel but since watching your videos I have lost hours of my life just watching them. Keep up the great work
the old man reminds me of an British actor can't think what he was in but a lot of character parts like a cop. detective
b4 buying it, find the guy that sweeps the floors or general dogs body, give him your word you wont tell anyone and pay him 500 to find out on the quiet what is the lowest price they would except for the Murcielago, ive done this before and in one case saved 25% of the price and the lady told me for free she wasnt happy at her job i guess
I watched every episode and damn I nearly cry out when the engine back to life！! What a journey!! Thank you Mat !
Dude, I even cried watching the engine turn on 😂
Freaking awesome 👏
After watching your videos on a super car i will never ever waste my money on a overpriced POS like this!
22:35 i almost cry ❤️❤️❤️🥳🥳🥳👏👏👏👏👏💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻 GOOD JOB DAD AND MAT I LOVE YOU GUYS 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The belt resonance is not the frequency of the soundwaves but the frequency the belt itself vibrates, though @ 10:20
I always say There are 2 ways to do things, The right way and AGAIN. Just remove the heads and do it correctly!!!
Having Dad like this is priceless !
Only the ones who do nothing do not make mistakes. I really like that you also show the faults. 👍👍👍
Well done Lee. Top man.
The murcielago is such a iconic car all the love from Britain
To think that these wonderful cars and the knowledge and passion around them are all to be consigned to the eco dustbin.  To all young car lovers out there, you are the last generation so enjoy it while you can.
Cool😀
How can you afford to do such projects? It has always been my dream to work on supercars! I really enjoyed watching your videos and hope someday I have the budget to build one
These are great watches.
Genuinely chuffed you got that engine going 😂
And this is why dads are irreplaceable even if yall dont fix cars just man and his son/s
so nice to see you happy with your dad :)
A W S O M E .. well done 🎉❤
Matt did you just moved your entire unit to the states 🤔or did Tav just visited you in the Uk? Awesome job you are doing man,  making connections and pursuing your passion :) Great job man. Your channel might've actually took me out of the depression of unemployment. Can't wait to smash it as well for myself. Bless all your family and friends. All the best
I absolutely adore the Lamborghini Murcielago, It is truly a timeless and beautiful piece of art. There is no better sounding V12 that Lamborghini has made to date. I literally cried tears of joy when I heard her sing that beautiful tune that the V12 does.
Your dad is look like putin
Goes to show, lazy ALWAYS costs more in time effort, energy and money.  Always does me.
Lambo is the best…🇨🇦🇨🇦👍👍❤️❤️worth keeping it working👍👍👍👍👍👍thanks for sharing
That is a beautiful car. I would love to have one.
By the way, Damon over at DDE is looking for a gated Murci, lol...............
Love the true emotion that is in your content. It's refreshing to see a father and son documenting content for the joy of overcoming obstacles and not just seeking clout. So very glad I found your channel.
You don’t put sealer over o rings - only on the metal mating surfaces
The wah-er pump. 😅
Man, when that thing fired up, I was laughing and crying like a child. What a journey this has been. Thanks for sharing it with all of us Mat!
Seeing you all this with your dad makes me realise how fortunate you are. My dad had dementia from his very early 60s, but my best times with my dad were under a Datsun 180B when i was 17 and 18 yo.  Treasure these times with your dad mate. I know you will because they will be on YouTube unless you pull them one day. They're incredibly important times.
The belt tensioner technique is GENIUS, I would never imagined that it is possible to tension it just like a guitar chord. Amazing.
I balled my eyes out when the engine turned on 🥺🥺🙏🏽
Do it right do it once
How is it possible not to love Mat's boundless and infectious positivity? No matter what happens, he finds it fun. And so do I....
You guys are great genius ❤️❤️❤️ from 🇳🇵 Nepal
cAR gOd!
after many months of holdup due to the oil pump. this time was the most monumental where the engine working.also thanks to your dad for the helping hand and emotional support
This made me miss my dad.
a freaking nightmare
I was yelling at my phone to start with you man well done
Never touch the pipes with bare hands 😅
The amount of time it took just take the heads off
It’s sound insane
Just like when they started the crashed plane in the film “Flight of the Phoenix” if your old enough to remember it 😂
i never thought in my whole life i would be seeing someone tuning a auxiliary belt like a guitar :D
Bro that feeling
bro its sick man it almost feels like a beast lion waking up and roar after long time what a beast engine man
Cannot imagine how loud that was!👍👍👍👍
Superb, not only a great Dad, humans have been making fire for at least half a million years, no you got a Murceielago to do it for you !
Tuned to perfection using a cellphone. I like your style mate!
Hi Mat enjoy your videos very informative, .and your presenting you should be on the BBCs Top Gear everything you say if not going to plan is always said with a smile and a determination to succeed
Brilliant
I was literally crying 😢 after it started
Look at the smile at the end, do a Tesla make you feal like this NO!
Please put on gintani exhaust
Loved that. Seeing you and your dad working together to get that going is just the best. Channel is epic, thank you.
after mumfs
bloody buzzing Mat :)
It's started from farts 💀 to the Lamborghini V12 sound ☺️👌
Yes Matt I’ve never been so willing to a video in all my life 😂 I’m only down the road from you so if you ever need any fabrication work doing just let me know. We have a factory in Birmingham, R and S laser Cutting & fabrications just Google us and comment on here if you need anything 👍🏼👍🏼
thats what we need is, more clowns
To be honest I would have expected that you first hug your dad and then Hannah after the car ran for the first time...
Heck yeah Mat!!!!!! When all 12 of them kicked over and it started it went from chaos to harmony! That incredible familiar high pitched Lamborghini-Murci Purr! Can’t wait to see you drive it!
I know this might annoy the lambo purists, but this engine is hell.   Not sure on fitment but surely you could just use the v10 from the bmw m6 with a fit a big fat super Ess charger.  Drift works fit it to a e46 m3 and that's a much smaller engine bay.
I love these type of builds and I think whats even more awesome is even though you guys across the pond from one another you can tell both you and Freddy have a true passion unmatched for the cars and things you guys do to bring them back to life love it and you both together working on one is CLASSIC.
I had the sprocket that is tattooed on your arm on my bmx sadly i swapped the sprocket for another one
This part brought tears to my eyes,absolutley love it,you and your mechanic (bald man) are the best,thank you for allowing me to experience such a miracle.     Csaba From Hungary ;)
I love the sound of the v12 😍😍😍
Well done every body 🐶😻✂️🇪🇸😎
BMW m5 part7 video?
There's only one way to do this and it's the right way lads...
May as well just do it right the first time …
Thanks for all the videos ✌️❤️
The italian engineers have to be so freaking romantic with the band's resonance deal 🙄
Omg bro been waiting months for you to get that thing cranked I'm so proud of you bro congratulations🎉
The best video so far for sure even I was shouting come on
The Happiest Moment 21:38 <3
omg.
😢😢😢😢😢
that special moment the engine got in to life made tears for lot of us, it was so huge emotional moment, congrats, and cant wait to see the next episode Mat
The happiness ❤😭
The time you spent trying to cheat you could've done it right the first time
There is no such thing as an easy and cheap workaround on a Lamborghini...not even on their tractors. 🙄 You have to bite the bullet and do it as they do in the factory. Yeah! That sound makes grown-ass men giggle! I'm glad it finally went right for you.
Try to make it start instantly
You guys must be damn tired... Please have a Bo' ohw 'o' wo 'er'😂
car vertical owe me some money
Amazing video!!
Watching the Murcielago come to life just fills me with joy and tears. Such a special moment. <3 thank you so much for sharing.
22:27 it sounds like a diesel tractor starting in the winter looool
The lambo is nice and all, but im sure what he'll treasure the most is the time spent with his old man.
well done pal, your a legend 👍👍
Best dad ever I had him I would finish all my projects  !!!!
In Germany we call this „pfusch“
Spent as much time trying to bodge it than you would have by taking the heads off
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where there’s a will, there’s a way 🧠💪💚🙋‍♂️🙏
Dude I threw my hands up when it started with you good job
wow amazing team work
Just found you; great show; Dont make it 2 wheel drive i drove one of these across spain in the snow 4 wheel drive was just amazing safe sure footed keep the car as it was made pls
7:24 ngl i am pretty happy it leaks, so maybe you do it properly?
Povero motore 😅
Well, your video was in my feed and I'm glad I watched it. You have a new sub here! Your joy with getting that V12 running is infectious, it had me smiling! And Freddy!!! Be well and safe travels!
Go home Freddy fix the P1 waiting for videos 😂
U went for looks over sound yes looks nice even threw camera can totally tell the sound is no were near gintani that just has no the downpipe length mods to sound like a screaming f1 style there is another person in uk another youtuber got a exhaust done by think it was a rapper not ksi he’s big guy love suoercars always has on a side back his exhaust was the closest your gonna get to gintani
Man ur honestly living the dream , I know it's really hard work and probably frustrating at times .... but damn rebuilding a lamborghini with ur DAD, nice
Dude says every car is his dreamcar💀
I’ve seen a cooper clubman just like mine 😊
Emotional 😭
engines killers
Excellent stuff 👏
"Strumming my belt with his fingers, one time one time"🎵
Congratulations!  Not many could do what you and your team did.
Not really the first turn of they key haha but anyway nice lads!
I am in the opposite side the world, but i like the enthusiams of this man, im rooting on this build actually...
You should sell that for millions even for all the hard restoration work you did.
eftar mumps ov wirk lol
Your living MY dream
What a waste of money 😢
Ma avete messo gli O ring di aliexpress😢
Soon as the rubber hammer came out to make a part fit I knew it would not even well 😂.    You guys are doing an amazing job!  What progress you’ve made!
Congratulations 👏
Part 11 plss
I am so happy, that your Murcie finaly works ! ❤❤❤❤❤
VW R36 Build?
Watching dad jump around with glee is priceless! We are all still kids somewhere in deep. Excellent video as always. Cheers from the US desert🌵
Hey Matt, u inspired me,  I’m doing my boys corsa head gasket in a car park
HELL YEAH!!! I've waited MONTHS for this moment! Listen to it, it's a BEAST! This has been one of the most entertaining series on YouTube EVER. CHEERS, Matt!!!
Never thought I’d be getting so much joy of watching somebody on the internet starting a car for the first time. Congrats Mat!
yet another cartuber who has taken the carvertical pay off where they charge 30 quid for a report you can get alot cheaper everywhere else...smh
That sounds like a good tractor. Are you sure its lamborgihi engine and not belarussian tractor engine?
Do it properly or don’t do it at all ….dodgy AF
Wow I was worried it wasn’t going to start , great effort guys 😊
Too much trash talk, wants me to skip and skip
Hi Matt,  Thankyou.  Fantastic just found this post, after following previous work on the Lamborghini,, was wondering how far you were down the track. What a great sound , after all the frustration to hear it fire then run and almost idle brilliant.  Look forward to the next post.
Audi engine* haha!   Keep your head up bro! Just think of the mistakes as lessons you've learnt and it will all be worth it in the end 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Solo grandi emozioni grande Mat 🎉🎉❤
Absolutely amazing video matt
Nice One!
The dream became reality 😍
Hello, I love your videos but I don't agree on your choice of not removing the heads for putting the orings in their place: you now have a potential point of failure in your engine.  I'm glad that the car started.  Ale
I was literally screaming watching the engine get started.. 🤩🤩 i could imagine how much it means to mat n team ❤️💥💥
i'am na new subscriber because of the Lamborghini rebuild hehe
congratulations🔥🔥🔥🔥
Brilliant mate brilliant !!
Awesome start to a Sunday watching the start up. Congrats to the team.👍
Such a natural joy that came out of the payoff at the end, I couldn’t stop smiling, just like you.
It would be the collaboration of the century.
Painful thing to redo the same thing basically 4 times but also kind of proof of how doing it the right way once may save you time and money instead of doing it by cheating a little heh. Great video. Let this be a lesson to all of us who will definitely rebuild our own murcielago engines using this as a guideline 😂
Check out chads Fabs in Utah. He is associated with Matt’s off-road recovery and Robbie Layton. He can make that harness.
Congratulations brother ❤
millennial thing They don't fail, ever.
Well you guys probably know this but if its leaking cold oil it will leak harder when the oil is hot because it becomes thinner and more viscous as the temperature goes up.
Absolutely amazing to see the mercy alive 🙌🏼 💚💚
Great work, everybody!
Matt,  A little girl needs your help urgently! Could you please get in touch if you read this? Your influence could save the life of a 2 year old and the daughter of a fellow car enthusiast. Please everybody, keep commenting on this post so he sees it! I've inboxes you on Instagram too!
You could just as well buy your dad in edition a Rolls-Royce Merlin airplane engine to rebuild, play around, make noise, posses and have fun with? And a small series of that all maybe could become a massive success at YouTube as well?
Just wanted you to know that I love your channel and I have enjoyed every minute of it specially working with your dad I love working with my dad so it means a Lot to me keep up the good work my friend.
Epic Mat best build so far 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
My BMW e93 was written off category n. Driver airbag and pyro fuse gone. Worth buying back and fixing?
Bet they started it off camera, to be sure it would start when that guy got there heh.
Excellent! Congratulations!
f*ck EV's, this is the real thing! Crazy good job.
Am I missing any vids as it seems like eternity from 1 to the next😢 On the plus side…..Yfood….OMG The Vanilla one taste like Ambrosia custard….🤤🤤🤤 Just ordered lots with your discount code  Thank u very much  Me nd the wifey 👍👍
Dear Mat, you’re not at the dentist you don’t need to keep smiling like a horse.
Insane! Really happy for yall achieving this super difficult task. Congrats!
At no point did teddy leave pram….. if this was my car teddy would be in orbit !!!!
What a beautiful video brought tears to my eyes!! Man you look so excited Tavarish left early ha?
When you needed to just see this car start so you can actually continue living your own life like it’s been on pause 😂❤ Matt you’re awesome
I can understand the allure of getting a Lamborghini running on the cheap (relatively) but such a high performance thoroughbred can't be fixed and run safely without potential danger of failure arising.  Sketchy doesn't inspire much peace of mind. It's a wealthy persons car.
Go to The lamborghini dealer and ask what they think
quintessential car repair. hard work and the power of satisfaction 😉
The car wasn't used for 7 years and you haven't cleaned all the petrol system before starting it?😮
Genius at work!
We all know Freddy is looking for a McLaren's parts car....!!!
Most waited video in the whole wide world of subscribers.🎉🎉❤
This has been so interesting love this show
Come on lads. Dont give up. Go Go Go.
Well done Matt. That moment when the engine fired was exhilarating. I rebuild 80's motorbikes and the feeling you get on the first start after rebuild is the same but on a much smaller (and cheaper) scale. Like you, I have always loved the Mercielago I am so glad you chose to save this one.  Really well done.
Best channel for sure👌🏼
And they reckon we will be all electric by 2030, GTFO🤣 love that Matt keep going lad
It sounded like a Traktor at the beginning😂
great achievement, but i don't think id love any car enough to go through all what you have !!
Mat you know this video just made me tear up like a little baby just that happiness on your face that moment lee cranked it for the first time the fact that I know this is your dream car since back in the day I'm all the way from south africa 🇿🇦  watching your videos I just wanna say you are a inspiration to me I'm actually tearing up writing this comment brother 😢 much love all the way from SA you are truly amazing
Matt looks like the actor Courtney Gains
I know absolutely nothing about cars, but the sheer joy in this video is brilliant
The letter "T" has left the chat.
Amazing work!
The ending was brill, so happy for you guys 🎉
It honestly gave me goosebumps!
That just made my whole day, the laughter every time something didnt work, i love the positivity from you and your father! Gratulations on the first start!
When that engine started, I think everyone’s face lit up  Not only that I now know how to rebuild a lamborghini merciélago engine from scratch lmao 😂😂
This is my favourite build, Mat. What a buzz it must have eventully been... I can't wait to see it finished. LEGENDS! the lot of you!! 🎉❤
I can't believe how invested I am in this - that was so satisfying, nice one brother!
👍🏼🛠🚙
Wow, awesome result. Dream project to do with your old man. Been fantastic watching your journey with this one
You're a genuinely nice bloke, Mat! You gave a fan (someone essentially unknown to you) the chance to first-start the Murcielago.  Small suggestion for you though: Please invest in a sandblasting cabinet for the removable metal parts. And use glass beads in it to get that metal shining up ;) It would look AWESOME on the Murcielago motor!
I can’t say why, but I genuinely got emotional when you started the car mat, can’t say why, but wow. What a feeling for you. Amazing. So proud of you mat❤
at last after all the trails and tribulations its a runner whoop whoop,  even i found myself fist pumping watching  😂😂, well done to your Dad and all who made it possible, i recon would have been a parts car the state ov it at start so saved it from the scrap yard as well, next one can't come quick anuff now, much love from Devon ❤
Now that's a real Puff Puff Bang Bang  💥🗯️💥🗯️💥💥
Nothing on this channel would be possible without his awesome father.
Matt....you, your Dad, Hannah and friends are a total inspiration, you fill my heart with so much joy and others that watch and never miss an episode, well done to you all, totally awesome achievement.
Morning Mat, fantastic result well done ,cannot wait for the next video, all the best from Malaga
Brilliant video, think we all felt the same about that first start😂 now onto them exhausts, and poss watching it move under its own steam. 👏🏻🙌🏻
Thanks Mat can you please keep everyone informed as how you  progress on the build. You are doing a Great job with very little experience. I have been in the motor industry for over 40 years. In Australia.I have never ever attempted anything like you have working on something with zero experience.I do want to see it on the road. Keep the videos coming.
Nobody abandons a Lamborghini
You are absolutely epic bro, as a guy who works with my dad every day I have to say you guys do it very elegantly! Just so happy for you two, I’ve really enjoyed this series and have to tell you I literally got emotional for you when that thing fired, what a roller coaster!!! Congrats man🤟🏻
Hahaaa awesome!  Well done, well gang! 🎉 🥹😆
Why do it properly. It only has to work until you sell it so what do you care
Omg what a bunch of cowboys. Just do it properly ffs. Would not bring anything to you so great advertising too. Jesus. Even if the bodge works then how long will it last. Could you ever trust it giving it the beans....
Man that immediately gave me tears with lot of smile when that cranked up mat! ❤
When's the next gt3 ep😢😢😢😢😢
Oh my gosh! Bro, I am feeling that vibe and the whole carousel of emotions!! When the engine started, I started to scream in the house and of course my girl was sleeping quite well 😂😂😂
what a hack job ... 😮
One lean, mean, green machine 😅
when you find yourself waiting for matts uploads😂🤌🏼
Ahh! AHHH!
Diablo or countach next Matt :)
Live you guys! So happy for you!!
Congrats man !
What a sound
Congratulations 👏👏👏
Nice job, never give up on your dreams and don't let people stop you from doing something YOU want to do. The engine timing might be out by a tooth. But I'm not sure fully.
Your father is so happy for you 🥲 best parent ever ! This is such a amazing build I followed it all the way so happy to see it start all the hours I spent watching this build .
I can't believe I shed a tear after the 1st Start,  Congratulations Mat ,it's been an amazing Journey and still is
Your happiness is infectious!
Brilliant 🤩
Wher is the bmw😢, love your yt
As someone who has rebuilt a car from scratch, that moment when the car comes back to life is one of the top things any gear head can experience.  Keep up the awesome job!!
The Murcielago is always my favorite car ❤
What would be his car?????? Bet you its a capri or mk1 escort....old skool
Well done chap.
This guy is nuts! In the best way possible. His gearhead joy is infectious.
Sounds mean AF
Did no one see the smoke in the back?
Just hearing the engine waking up for the first time months after the first video is such an amazing moment, the beast is having its primordial breath, the first ever breath it has in many years, it sounds raw and powerful, ready to tackle the road like a raging bull, Lamborghini might be an overpriced Audi/Volkswagen company, yet the engines are always the best sounding you can hear. I am truly glad that it finally woke up.
Great vidio, what are the steps needed to register the car for road use?
Amazing!!! Very well done all!! It’s very impressive what have achieved. Keep it up!!!!!
had such a shit shit day but watched this and smiled, thank you
Brilliant, loved it, better than top gear, well done team!!
Thank you for sharing your ways on this project! I really hope I'll be able to create something as awesome in a couple of years.
Mat Love the channel but can you get it in some sort of folder system - can’t follow your build story - it’s like TK MAXX - nothing in place !!! 😅😅 keep up the great work mate
I've literally been sat here going use some mica card 🤣 what we use to slip locks, then he came up with the shim idea 🤣
They dont have starting fluid in England?
Your dad the genius he really knows his cars
And the beast finally awakens! 🔥🔥🔥 Effin love this series
❤ the best !
the dude is SO RTRD ... fo real
Soon I think you're going to find those Volvo throttle bodies are incorrectly programmed for the Murci.. :-(
Man there is something about your videos that i just cant find anywhere else, the passion, the joy, the permanent good mood, love the content mate
Give your dad a hug instead of cheering 🤨
Dream-Maker Armstrong, We live vicariously through you!
That was intense ! Watching the lambo being brought back to life like Frankenstein's Monster ! Amazing
This was so cool you and your dad look like you guys have fun even if its been a headache
My uncle bought a salvage countach for $9k from an auction and put a 4.3L vortec into it. And drove it as a daily driver for like a decade and sold it for $35k
Do the job properly or not at all
oyeeoil presha
Mat I’m waiting for the BMW competition finish up.. nice work you’re doing
Great videos. Wish he posted more often
Epic...  said all petrol heads everywhere... Nice one Team Armstrong 👊🏼💪🏽
I can’t wait to see this finished.  Excited to see what colour you go with Mat. Quality content, keep it coming 👍🏻
What I wanna know is who the hell abandons all these super cars you keep finding?
Just watched the Sami your breaking the car video for the 1st time - absolutely hilarious !!!
Was so nervous watching that 😂
Epic
Blue ford mondeo m503 vhk registered under issac eric mccarthy craig mccarthy car sold it altogether at 71 bradan avenue glasgow g13 4je for 500 pounds never had it down london or England full a whatever where ever it's lieing couldn't tell you where that car is
👌👌👌👌👍
Why you did that to your ears,looks nasty  , but that lambo looks and sounds  great 💪🏼
Love the Lambo series in particular Mat, but you should have credited Tavarish the the description or video. Im sure a lot of your UK audience doesnt know about him. Also, he helped you…. So… ya know lol.
FINALLY! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Who can ever abandoned a Murceliago. Problably her owner is dead.
GT3 GT3 GT3 GT3
Smashed it lads!
Very cool 😎 👍👍👍👍
Resurrection of a dead Lamborghini engine, damn!🙌🏾
You should invite him back for the first actually run after the car is completely finish with paint job and everything to let him get that feeling of riding a lambo! Once in a life time for some of us
That's the stuff dreams are made off.
omg.. I yelled when the car started up.. and woke up my family.. But, WAS SO EXCITED to see it finally start up for you.. much respect and love to you..
Good on ya, mate!
Absolutely awesome journey to rebuild this legendary BAT ! I love Murciélago so much and I'm happy you finally did it! Congratulations to you 🎉.
This video is so beautiful.
3Bar is equal to about 43.5 PSI
Effin' awesome!
So epic bruva
If you didn’t have a massive smile while they were trying to start it then I don’t know if you’re human 😂😂.
The best first cold start ever
Congrats man thats litt!!.. lol next time clear out the fuel system beforehand and prime it as well and itll fire right up..
Best car Channel i ever see
Seeing that engine start up after all the work, absolutely fantastic!
brilliant......... very expensive and tricky car to work on, you've done really well
Only me alone see how those  car are made just a iron wel together
Snap crackle, pop! She’s alive 👍🏼
Made impossible thing possible.  Mat is guy of honours man!!!!
One of the best videos ever! You all rule! Love your work and enthusiasm 💪
This channel is what I aspire mine to be like. Really love the editing story and work and how they show all the detail and problems that they had to tackle. It's hard work :)
What’s the song title at the very end. Advanced thanks
Love from south Africa
Mat should keep this car once it's sorted. I'm a tree hugging 'ecomentalist' as Jeremy Clarkson once put it, but even I see the Murcielago as being iconic. 🙂
soooo excited!
😊  Big thumbs up to you Matt & your father.  Really enjoying your journey!  Al
Hi Mat, do not be mad at me lol but it is not your skill as a mechanic that make me look at your video but it's more the way you express yourself in your video presentation, not to many youtuber have this ability to make everything so interesting to look at. I have been following this rebuild and for sure I will be looking at the others.
Did I just see cut-off jeans, or were they just cut off?
When is the porche video coming out
Epic 👍👍
Fuckin buzzin. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  hahahaha
Ur dad is an absolute legend
Amazing work, i looking and being happy together with you all.
Super interesting project. Id be torque wrenching every last item on that thing haha just running the plugs down id just feel uneasy.
Well done mate
Love your authentic way showing joy 👍🏻keep following your heart ❤️
Just one word: goosebumps!
Hey Matt! I want to suggest a 2003 Lambo on Copart that I would LOVE to see you rebuild! It's literally torn into TWO separate pieces right thru the middle. It has a salvage title so it's rebuildable! Love your channel! Keep up the great work!
Whoop whoop!!!
The Sound of The Engine!!!!!! Too Nice 👌
dont touch titanium with bare hands. it will leave fingerprints when heating up
Well done you guys patients of a saint ,I would have give up long ago 👍
absolutely proper mate! Well done 🤙
Oh yessss, this is mega! Love it
Some bar is better than no bar ;-)
I remember starting my kit-car engine for the first time. Only a £300 1.6 CVH turbo, straight out of a Ford Fiesta RST (into my Westfield), but shitting myself, all the same. Awesome feeling when it splutters into life. Well done all.
those headers are in the perfect place for turbos
That was the sickest and most suspenseful start up I've ever seen😂great job mat
Wow Mat. Your channel has really exploded over the last few months. Well done. And thanks for your helpful TT video's back in the day. You (hannah actually) gave me the confidence to do my first oil change on my MK2 years ago.. :)
Well done. A milestone.
being a car guy myself, first fire ups are the most nerve wrecking and most amazong moments. I clapped with you guys on the first fireup and the second! have followed your build and y'all are doing great!!
Loved watching this series over the last few days. Fairly new to the channel but started watching after the piece you did with Drivetribe. Loving the content and hearing the Lambo come back to life was amazing 👌🏻
no no no
Brilliant video Matt, makes you fall in love with the car even more hearing that sound wow!!
Man, I'm from Brazil! Just want to congratulate you for this fantastic job. When the car started I got so happy for you and your team. I can't stop saying this is a fantastic job.
Best thing I've seen in a while 😎
Great❤ congrats!!
21:36 I feel HAPPY This concludes “You need to surround yourself with people who support you to build something ultimate”.
Twin turbo kit while it’s out ?
WELL DONE MAT & ur mechanics & ur Dad big thumbs up👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That sound and emotions !
I'm so happy that you got Lamborghini Murcielago finally started 😊
Awesome ❤
Just amazing, what is the current status I have goose pimples are ridiculous and how funny to be emotionally involved in a rebuild engine. You guys are brilliant and hats off to you.
Well done!!!
Short cuts aka laziness is never helpful.
Not anywhere did I see Mat or his dad hook up the radiators to the engine.
This Lamborghini video reminds of the first Lamborghini they had no idea what they was doing but still created a car and Matt is doing something amazing
I got the goosebumps when the car engine started to crank up😂💥watching the whole thing through till this stage is thrilling , i love the resilience and consistency  This channel is very entertaining 🎉keep it up.❤
You and Tavarish are the coolest car restoration Youtubers Imo!!!
YES Absolutly great Mat !!!!!!!
Hey Matt, are you planning to paint the car before wrapping?
Horror like when i hat my aprilia
Splendid as usual
How to bodge a V12 rebuild 😂
That call was cool, Mat is really charismatic
Read quran
Awesome !! congrats guys i was cheering as well. great work.
Congratulations buddy! Your enthusiasm is infectious!
Drugs.
Maybe is to early as i am half through watching this one. Get someone to read the intrument chip from old clocks that stores the milleage ( eprom). Talking about silly😅. Again no experience with that type of car but an ideea that might be viable.
Great job, guys!! We all were pulling for you!! What a glorious day.
Shoutout to the guys from Ultima, Lee and Jeff!
Guys you are the best!😎
Congratulations 👏 Brother 🖐️
what a great moment and high risk of failure, especially when someone comes a long way to start it first time. great job on this insane racecar! mastered!
I've never been that interested in cars - A 2 B is all I'm bothered about but I have enjoyed watching this series so much!  Couldn't wait for this episode, well done Mat, Dad and the team 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Well done team!!!! I love it!
Legend has it they will never drive that car
They way i celebrated when it started! Well done Mat.
Epic well done
Did Mat pay for Freddy trip to UK?
Check the timing Mat it sounds like it’s out just a bit.
Awesome mate😎✌️👍
Best episode yet 🍾
I’m not even a petrol head but love watching these videos! Your positivity and resilience is infectious!   Your love for these builds come across on every video and that’s what makes them them so enjoyable.
Just amazing!
Love it!! Great job by everyone involved!! Can't wait to hear that V12 sing properly 😍
Great episode Mat!  Such a good thing to see it start! 😊
Loved it as always. ❤😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
The fact that im about to watch this start gives me a lot of inspiration! Keep up the great work Matt! Much love from Virginia USA
Yeeeees!! 😬 ❤️
It's alive...ALIVE!!!!!!!........Mwohahaha
I was into tears after hearing the first crank. I was so closely following this particular project that i felt it was one of my success to hear the engine start. It feels blessed that i found you content. I would love to see the car in real one day.
Back to life! Great Job Matt! JP from Argentina
Wtf! I found myself crying 😢😅 congrats Matt! 🎉
Happy for you guys.
Why cut corners? You should have pulled the heads in the first place
Wow nice performance guys ❤
My question is, Have you guys in em comments ever seen Mat Angry or mad ?. Mans always HAPPY 😆😃
Glad to see it started! I’m so happy for you and your dad.  I’ve been looking forward to seeing this thing run and you guys didn’t disappoint.  Cheers!
Fantastic bloody awesome !!  Well done guys 👍😎
👏👏👏👏super Happy for all of you🍻 Congrats , keep does manuals alive🍻
Throw the cooling system together quickly and take it for a tune session on the dyno. It’s running but something is still a bit off and I think a tune will buff that out. It may even boost your stock horsepower as well. Once it’s tuned, then you can pretty up all the wiring and hoses and finish it out. Gives you more space to make adjustments while you’re on the dyno if you wait to put the extra bits in.
Yh Matt dad is cool he should do a video like that for him
Awesome bro!  Love this series...
Freeze it.
Just dragging now
Wow super amazing this restoration
Awesome matt , well done the hole team 👏.  I was actually cheering for you all  👏 😀
yo thats so crazy since the first part ive been watching and it starts next make a video of it driving
What's that smoke at 5:59 in the back of the engine?
Phew! That was intense for a good while. Congratulations team Armstrong!!!🎉👏
So awesome to see you, your dad, and everyone involved successfully start the murcielago. I'm so invested I can't wait to see it on the road.
Brilliant video 😊 seems like the firing order or timing is out to me.
Does anyone know the name of the piano song at 11:50? Thank you
👏👏👏
Congratulations buddy
10:40 what if there is dust in the phones mic and it is hearing lesser.
That was brilliant!! I'm so happy for Mat and the team, finally got there in the end. Bought that beast back to life. What about that roar she let off just before she turned over!! 😍 had to listen to that twice 😂
Can you imagine the people who originally designed engines back in the day of ww2. When they designed manufactured and starting forbthe first time. I imagine it something like this x50
would have been cheaper to buy a working one.
Awesome Mat, your dad too i was on the edge of my seat.....big smile felt like I was there I love it!!! Well done super Ace!!
Made my day seeing it start, been proper invested in these vids on the Lambo. Really hope you realise just how amazing your old man is as well.  Love the content mate keep it up
Absolutely awesome fairplay 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼🤘🏼
Wicked! Really happy for you broski! Back on 2007 my friend had one, we pulled over on the M62 and watched him fly past at 170mph it was the early hours of the morning and the sound as it came towards us was something I'll always remember
CHAMPIONS
Tavarish came down to England?
Love the way when you need a pick me up a virtual Tavarish arrives!! 😂😂
Tip my hat. Well done guys.
Feels like this channel is Mo Vlogs done right
Well done! I knew you could do it. Such an achievement!😊
Yes! I actually yelled "YEAH!" with excitement, when it started for the first time.  Well done, Mat. 🙌
Love this, I watched the whole journey. What an amazing journey and achievement
I'd love to rebuild a car with my old fella. He used to drag me out to help him fix cars when I was a kid, I used to moan that I wanted to go play....now I love tinkering. Well done
Top job there Matt.  Nothing like all the effort paying off when it springs into life.  👏👏
Freddie involved! Nice one
Your father is so cool
God, i hope you flat black that car!! just like Bruce Wayn!!!
Mat's channel must be popular if a viewer buys a t-shirt, then drives down to start his rebuilt supercar. 😊
Well done Dudes!! So much bouncing around in that video - not seen you guys that happy before! Cant wait to hear it with that exhaust on.
When you going to finish the GT3?
Your joy is contagious 🎉 Got me a bit emotional here …
Great video, i was even holding my breath when you fired it up 🎉
Been watching you from the start and your dad is a legend, this journey of the Lamborghini has been amazing so pleased it started can’t wait to se edit when it’s finished
My dream car is gallardo
Amazing!!! Been waiting for this moment for weeks!! Congrats to you and your team for bringing this beauty back from the dead, you guys are incredible.  Can’t wait for the next video on this beast!
😎✌
Mat you are a good fella, combined with Freddy you are on another level
Bruv, tightening the belt with a Samsung phone app, on a phone lol. That won’t of been accurate in the slightest
Sounded like a car starting in minus 40 temperatures 😁 congratulations on FINALLY  getting the Murch running Matt 🥰🥰 you and your dad make a great team 🙂
Was so excited for the start well happy for you done so good 💪💪
good video matt with rebuilt old murcielago.
This video was an amazing morale boost. Misses and I are both not well and was a massive positive and happy video. Love it! Keep up the amazing work! ❤
Well Done mate
I follow now from the first Video / the PT1 Video was the time were i know you first time. Congratulations! Ich Feier Dich! All the best from Hamburg, Germany! ❤
Finally!!
Nice 1 , congrats
amazing well done
I have removed and reinstalled a V8 in a Range Rover Classic, I can't imagine how hard that V12 was to squeeze in
This was soooo Epic!
Best rebuild ever i got alot of learning from the lambo especially on engine timing and getting parts from other car brands
I watched all 10 episodes and followed the journey for the last months. Love the fire that came out of that engine. Great work Mat. And great content. Thanks. All the best from Sweden.
Well done guys the joy in your face mirror mine😂😂😂
Yeeeeeeeesssssssss! It didn’t sound like it was going to start for a moment then. Well done I couldn’t be happier for you!  Totally unbelievable
Oh I'm sorrae... I meant FLUted
It's Futed is it mate
👍👍👍
Well bloody done mate!!! And I love that ya dads just as bonkers as you!!
Holly crap..u did it
Your stering wheel is on the wrong side 😂
If he would of taken the header out he would of not taken twice as long
Say "starter motor" like the dude in the video 😎
Just first it sounded  like timing  was. Out
I just watch M539 restorations another self thought mechanic but 2 very different worlds, 2 very different mechanics, if you don’t do it right you will keep having problems, it will not stop, the more complex the engine the worse it gets
This really made me smile 😁
Let s go its start up so nice project.
I would find it difficult to damage the car with an internet site :)
The way you handle your content and the execution of how the video plays out is just amazing and you deserve waaaay more subscribers than you’ve got lol awesome stuff
So good I watched it twice
Genial, que buen rollo y que sonrisa. Aquí también hemos saltado cuando  al fin ese motor ha arrancado
Wicked well done, everyone 😎👍
" health and safety " what an absolute gem.. well done to all - phenomenal content
I wonder how many hours were spent doing it the wrong way 3 times versus just removing the heads and doing it the right way.
I can't believe I got tears of joy when the motor started. So happy for you guys!Can't wait to see the final stage!
Very nice see this video
Building a V12 Lambo engine with a hammer epic
You and your dad are legends.🎉
Epic vid
😅😅😅
❤
Fuck .. That made me smile ear to ear....
nice🎉
Mat is freddy still in uk
So pleaed for you mate :)
Almost had me in tears brother. Genuinely happy for you!
Because people abandon lambos
Would be cool to see you on carwow! Race your repaired and modified cars against Matt Watson! I wrote a comment on the carwow channel for Matt Watson to reach out to you and do some collaboration! Please also reach out to Carwow!
Good jod ❤🎉
RTV also known as Honda Bond is amazing. You just throw it all over, bolt up, and no more leaks hahahaha
Congratulations on the first start. I will say that you will absolutely want to install the full exhaust system and get the car to an experienced Lamborghini tech with the correct computer. The early cars need to have their throttle bodies calibrated and it can only be done with the computer. As a tip, make sure the calibration is run a number of times. Most techs only do it once but if you run it multiple times it more and more fine tunes the settings and yields a result you can really feel. My tech ran mine 5 times and it was a big difference to drivability and smoothness. Also if you get the computer hooked up they can diagnose a lot of parameters on the engine and make sure it is running correctly. Again awesome work and well done on the engine start milestone.
The best channel on YouTube by a country mile….
The sound!! THE SOUND!!!  Utterly brutal Mat, love it!
super cool super car gays
So happy I found your channel. Love it!
I think that the timeing needs to sorted all for it to starting right.
You brave man I salute you for rebuilding this engine.
why does this sound like Ali A
Great watch and project 😂 well done all
It's going to be legendary mate. Amazing job.
😂😂 I love your lots energy bro glad it started up for you. Awesome video keep up the work
Your dad is well buzzing.
I ❤ the Mushi-largo
great video but please learn how to pronounce the name of the car mur-sie-la-go not mur-sia-laego
seeing the Murcielago slowly get the signature Lamborghini V12 sound as it springs to life is honestly cool as hell
TOTALLY BRILLIANT guys!!!!!!! AMAZING determination and continuous confidence!!! WELL DONE ALL!!!! I was literally clapping along with you at the end!!!!!! WOW!!!!!
I like that job bro  Your team the best ❤
Remind me not to buy that car…
just a reminder to tell your dad you love him cause you will miss him when he's gone
This is by far the most sketchy project yet. That said Matt will get it going if it takes up to his last breath. Keep plodding on fella.
Brilliant 🎉🎉 love the energy in your videos, even when you have to fix the oil leak for the 3rd time 😂
Those are the magic moments it’s all about 🕺!
Greattttt
Freddy on UK!! Awsome!!
You really look like matt watson with beard tbh. 😂
@matarmstrong, can't lie my dude; I genuinely got really emotional when it finally fired up. Knowing how much time and passion you put into these builds just makes everyone pray that they are going to work out for you. Keep doing what your doing, we are all routing for you, all the time.
What a momentous moment in youtube history!!
Awesome!
Finally 😁
The view count these videos get just don't add up with the rest of the community interaction with this channel. Something fishy with it... 🧐
Bhai ke maje hi yar 🎉
WHAT a cool video!, congrats Matt!
Absoultely amazing man! Congrats to you and your family for all the hard work over the last few months. So much respect over one's that just buy these cars outta the box. Such a great support team you have there. Las Vegas salutes you!!!!
i hope my country have some abandoned cars like this
Amazing Mat, great job 🎉🥳🥳👍
You are such an amazing man, Mat. Congratulations and fingers crossed. Rooting for you and your projects all the way from Romania. You’re a gem!!!💥🎉💥🚀
It kills me to know everything will be electric when my son is old enough
HELL YES WOHOOOO
I’m not buying one!
Well done dude
So happy for you !!!!!!
A true LEGEND, you can not fake that nervousness, excitement and relief on your face Mat when that car finally came back to life.
Mat ain't afraid to show his mistakes and he addresses them until they are fixed.
What about a classic restore of a dodge charger rt in green . I know of one sat in a green house in a garden centre in Gloucestershire
tavarish is here so he can buy P1 parts  bloody legend
Loved watching this video Mat - some good feels all through. I've said it before on your videos but I'll say it again. Watching you and the team makes me feel good!! Your videos just elevate mood, people, everything. It's a ton of work you guys put in but keep it up - and Thank You!
Best moment on YouTube right now !
The car sounds awesome. I want to see it on the road.
Fuck it was a moment for us 😍
May Allah guide you , he look smoked already 😂
Million views in 1 day , well done Matt
Your dad is awesome. Lol
Well done Matt. I agree with Barry K. Definiley your next project. treat him 😍
Edge of my seat, best video ever

Leeesssssss gooooooooo🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤ yooo finally it started❤❤❤ thank you king
Simply awesome Matt

Get Marty to voice over 'In the bin'
I got goosebumps when it kicked into life
What a result, epic Mat ! keep it up
Another example of Hard work pays off
In these days of false prophets and liars how nice to see genuine excitement 😊😊😊!
Oh Matt that final scene of you starting the car had me in tears. How can this journey you've taken us on be so emotional. I don't know how you stay so positive and happy through the worst problems. I think your almost there now so can't wait to see the next few videos as I'm sure the test drive won't be far off!
I love your dad man
Tuning a belt! That's insane. Watching you do this has been amazing. But it's confirmed I don't think I can ever rebuild a super car. I managed a Ford xr2 once but this has blown my mind! 😁
You have Sealed Your fate
Much love from RSA🇿🇦
Fantastic Matt, I'm glad it's finally started, well done
Mate when you finishing the M5?
The journey of this Lambo it's been amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Ah an absolute brilliant result, so happy for you and your Dad,
Brilliant Matt. Keep it coming
Gates Corporation makes microphone based belt tensiometers  that look for a specific frequency. It was very cool to see a phone and app perform this task. Why not! I used their instrument on thin (both ways) toothed belts that moved a tray on a desktop blood analyzer.
You can thank them in June 13th in London when they do the gumball 3000 from Scotland through to Europe
Omg lambo do go to bro bEEN LONG TIME COMMING WOW
You are an inspiration!
Yay Freddy.
Matt's videos are great, but that engine rebuild job is not to be trusted. I would not be surprised if it blows in 5k miles.
Congratulations!
Love it !!!!!!!
Gday gang, Woo-hoo!!! Congrats!!! 😁👍👍🍻
Awesome!!!
You should surprise your old boy with this car! He's a good man
Was I the only one, who literally cried, when the Monster first started?😅 You are such an amazing person, because your Dad is ,so that's  proven! Parenting is the most important thing in life! Your Dad  have done great job on parenting 😊 Massive respect for all you both guys doing❤ Keep the good work up 👍💪 Together forward to 2m. Subscribers. I am a Huge fan🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Your dad is awesome man, such a good spirit!
🙏
Mat and the crew stay up past 1am to put engine in.  Mat's dad at 5am: up and at em boys! Time to get to work!
I love seeing my 2 favorite car youtubers working together
AWESOME!! Oh Mat, you and your family, your Dad and wife and having friends with you and a lucky mate who bought a shirt and really did get it to start!! So good!!! Congratulations, it's a very HARD job doing what you've done here, no questions. Hell I did the top end on my Honda and it took me 2 days to get the damn thing to start, just needed to crank it a million times and it FINALLY went!! So good!!!
Spark Plugs need Copper Paste or Anti Seize!!!! Protect you invest with 2 seconds of preventative maintenance
I was super excited to hear the Murciélago run. Love your content amazing cars. 🎉
Congratulations on your first start love watching your channel

So surprised it started at all without all its hoses and pipes for pressure balance, well done Mat and family for bring this girl back from the brink 👍🏻❤️(sound reminds me of my beemer tappits every morning lol)
Can't believe it actually started. Can't wait to see this finished.

Lazy man works the hardest  I say that in jest but I do the same darn thing still to this day. It's hard to not try it!
I’m so glad you’ve got it running, after all your hard work you and your dad have put into it, well done lads keep up with the great work.
Great progress as always, look forward to seeing it finished, I saw a white Murcielago driving in Leicester last week, and it looked and sounded awesome. Just so different from anything else on the road.
You and your Dad are both Legends! It just goes to show that TEAM WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK! You two have done the Armstrong Community Proud every Vid that goes out make me want to watch more straight away! Thanks for the content Mat you my friend  have got this channel booming! 🙌🤙

Yay 🎉🎉🎉
I'm your biggest fan in south africa🇿🇦. You inspire me bro🤗
Honestly got a little emotional with this one. Lambo is my dream car and watching you bring this one back to life is brilliant
What times we are living in, 900.000 people watching and wanting an engine to start up.
Is that Stuart pierce the legend 😂
Congrats on getting it started. Great teamwork.
Just fucking remove the heads, wtf are you smoking?
Legends! Congratulations
All the struggles worth it
uhýtrtdcfvb
This build has been so killer! Love seeing your dad be such an integral part of getting the Lambo going. Can’t wait for the next installment
you guys are terrific video is fantastic and the cars cool…but forgive me when I say this but I couldn't help think this video could hurt the resale value of the car… Somebody might think it wasn't built by the professionals and they might be getting problems… But you guys can do it you can make it perfect.  I guess the first 10,000 miles will tell you
🎉🎉
Yeessssss mat
Said it before but I'll say it again. Officially the best car channel on YT! Both yours, and your Dads energy are epic! Can't wait to see this running 100%, you guys deserve it!
Yesssss!!!
Some of the best Wholesome content on the internet, seriously cheers me up watching that.
Nobody. Lamborghini: the belt timbre must be in Bb "Si bemol" note. Everyone: 😮

Love watching ur videos mate
, time well spent Mat, and Co ✌🏻
This is the best series on YouTube!
Mat your videos are awesome! I love cars and modding them! Also that guy u choose he seemed to happy and such an amazing experience for him!
if I was a gambling man I would say we have a good chance that this superb first start video staring Kevin will hit  1m  views  B4 Mat goes to bed
That was a true excitement and joy. But as a car guy as cool as it would have been to turn the key I’d have to hand it back to ya
What a journey, you have gone through so much with this car, I can feel the emotion with you man. Impressive workmanship :)
YEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!! This has made me so happy!!!!! dude, honestly you are the greatest thing on Youtube by a million miles. You are literally living the dream of every teenage boy, keep up the amazing work dude!!! I look forward to your uploads way too much!!! you need to make a Matt Armstrong Movie!!! 20mins a week isn't enough of the sheer delight of you doing stupid shit with cars that were destined for a scrapheap
Hi  matt just watched the first turn of key all I can say is wow. Well done
This is epic. The utter satisfaction on everyones face is priceless. 👌🏽
Buzzing for you Matt! Literally jumping for joy here when she fired up
FINALLY!
letsss gooooooooo
Just sat on the bed with the Mrs with everything crossed watching this just hoping and praying that it would start. Biggest grin on my face when it did 😁 watched this build from the start and can't wait to see the rest. Top job Matt and Matts dad 👏 best youtube chanel ever 😁😁😁😁👍
Amazing well done all of you 🎉
Astounding feelings all round
Don’t get down on yourself Mat, you could have bought and be fixing a P1 instead 😂😂😂😂
be thankful to have such a nice dad!
Well Mat, you've inspired me to do my own work - albeit starting on my motorbike, its taken all day and a LOT of swearing(!) but finally got it all sorted, car next!  Without doubt my favourite YouTube channel. Congrats on the start Mat and family!
Well done 👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌
Great work Matt and Dad. I had such a happy grin for your success
Yes! I was cheering too. great to see you got it going
well done Mat
EPIC!
Wow finally it start
Dude I love your dad lol, I love the compassion both of you share for the art of cars, him laughing had me smiling from ear to ear hahaha
“There is a cable in it, health & safety” 🤣🤣🤣
Best channel on YouTube ❤
That was epic
IT'S ALIVE, ITS ALIVE!
I personally wouldn’t of used rtv. Just do it right.
You are crazy. Massively entertaining. Well done young man.
How on earth does he sleep with all the stress he must be feeling, I’m awake all night if my wheelbarrow develops a squeak
@Matt Armstrong you make fixing project cars look so easy. Much love from Kampala, Uganda.
I really hope you haven't destroyed the engine after all your hard work .
Omg how emotional was that video, well done to you and your dad for all your hard work in getting the Lambo to this stage of the build 😀😀
🤩🤩🤩well done to you, big thank you here from Denmark🤩🤩🤩
Best video yet! Brilliant stuff 👍🏻👍🏻
Amazing moment firing up the V12 after so many set backs 🙏💪🏁
Fabulous
Wow I actually got emotional when it started 🙈😂🤜🏼🤛🏼
Finally 😊
😂 congratulations Mat. Incredible achievement. Keep the videos coming. 😊
Your hardcore Hardwork just paid off! Great work mate🙌🏻
wow… can’t believe it started. Such a great journey. So happy for you. can’t wait for the next video!
Started watching the Murcielago build yesterday and finally caught up.   Absolutely brilliant from basically nothing to getting that almighty V12 firing up for the 1st time.   Mate such an inspiration to watch.  Hopefully this summer I can start work on my little Clio lol ready for the ring.  Keep up the brilliant work.  👊🏾🙌🏽
Great video
Absolutely brilliant 👌 finally that sound of accomplishment, bravo to you and the lads and everyone involved!
Freddy in the UK!! Lets goo 🤣
Congrats 🎉
It's brilliant you've teamed up with tav! Good team ! Really hope the build works out
Freddy needs to do a European version of Car Trek..
Your little make shift team of misfits getting the engine in was hilarious and glad to see Freddy in the UK and spending some time away from the states! What a collection of folks doing it the true backyard way 😂🤣 feel like I’m there and part of the crew. You do a great job at making the viewer feeling inclusive. You admit every little mistake, like we all make at the end of the day, making it feel even more relatable. Was pumped as this video kept going on and on. I’m stoked to see this thing start!  Edit: Man and to see the smiles on everyone’s faces once she started popping and trying then it came to life, even briefly, was awesome! Again, feel like sort of the crew and as if we (the community) have a part in it. Can’t wait for more videos with it!!
Mat and his Dad, Chris Slix and Freddy ,these are my inspiration.
Big kid in a candy shop, you are a legend 😂
Thats fukcing awesome MAT! <3
Massive congratulations mate. Well done 🎉🎉👏🏻👏🏻🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
:) Brilliant work guys
Cant watch these videos without a massive smile on my face every time. By far the best youtuber of all. You deserve every bit of success that you have earned, and it's a pleasure to come along for the ride. As always you smashed it
I don't have a car or even a driver's license! And yet, I love watching these videos :). Keep going Mat! Hi from France.
Just FxxKIN' amazing! ❤
Well done mat had all the fairh in you and your dad for getting the lambo 🏃 😂
The beast is alive and it breathes fire..
where the hell did tavarish come from 🤣🤣🤣
Your Dad is amazing!
Man I so wanna see this one in person! that's amazing!
Meennnnn I am so exited to see this Murcielago finished. I am looking forward to the next video already.
what a legend and such an inspiration to everyone else, keep up the good work mat cant wait to see the merci fully rebuilt!
Dedication ❤
Legend
How good is this doing it all with your dad love it
This series should be shown to every new dad as an example of best 👌
Mate I've watched this video 3 time's now ! Brilliant well done you
That was good sound at 1st sounded louder than my tractor in India but that was truly the sound of a old school lambo WOW can’t wait to see this driving around my city LEICESTER
I think this should be your forever car ... at no point should your ever raffle it off ... well never say never but imagine what this will look like with that exhaust and the wheel mania rims & paint ... your dream car SHOULD never be sold ... god knows what colour you will paint it as your are as crazy as Tim Burton wild bright colours lol .... pearl white ? or ?
Well done ,,
Awesome guys❤🎉
£47 for a rubber seal 😮 my two fenders for my ford focus £47-50 each lol on eBay..love eBay
How cool!!!! I love that your pops is right there at your side working with his boy and you two got success! Yes! 🤩🙌
thats crazy. also creating some great memories with your dad ay
Lol
its very motivational because all that hard work payed of at the end keep it up
Ahh seeing your dad did his celebration dance made my day go on dad
I look forward to your videos,they have such a good positive energy and can really lift your mood.great to see the buzz everyone gets out of sorting out these wrecks!
Finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Still waiting to roar in the road!! I hope I can visit there but naah! im from the philippines 😢
Instead of painting it the original green i think maybe it would look good in all black with subtle green accents like the lamborghini writing on the back and little green accents here and there🤷‍♂️
Bro look at ur dads smile as he pumps the oil lol what a legend
Can wait to see this complete great team effort so far and what a journey
Congrats. Realy happy for you!
Brilliant!
I’m so happy for you guys!! Fully deserved
Sounds like an old V12 F1 😮
That is going to sound sick at full chat with the titanium exhaust on, well done to you and your dad Matt
I haven’t seen that much popping since Timothy Solomon aka 'Popin Pete' in the 80’s 🤣
Man im addicted to these rebuild vids we need more 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Well done Matt and dad great job lucky guy Lee for getting the first start of the Murci
I've been watching this project from the beginning and I can't wait to see the finished item. Keep up the good work guys.
stoked to finally see it run! Even more gassed to see 0007 BMX pass me on the m25 yesterday.
That fix was sketchy, I'd have to remove the heads and do it the recommended way otherwise I'd always be worried it would blow.  Great to see Tavarish offering sage words of wisdom 😃
Waited so long for this video. Quality as usual❤
Wow love this. It starts this is amazing for you i see the joy in your smile
Magic, absolutely epic!
Good job all yours done
Being honest, if this is your dream build I’m very surprised you’re making short cuts like the o-rings.
Congratulations “no other words” 🤜🏻🤛🏻
I genuinely love Matts never say die attitude,  one of his strongest qualities ❤🎉
Nice sound! A beast!
Matt, you starting to mislead people with fake thumbnails, flames 🔥 out if exhausts when they are not fitted.  Where is the integrity gone? Too many YouTubers FAKE up their channel .  PLESSE DON’T  GET INTO THAT !
finaly brooo
Let's keep your dad on every project Mat please! <333
Yesssssss !!!  It makes fire 💥💥💥💥💨💥💨💨💨💥💨💨💨💥💥💨💨💥💨💥💥💨💥💥💥💥💨💥💥💥💥💨💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥
I was screaming at the tv!!🤣🤣 what an epic video! Absolutely love watching these rebuilds👌
More please
Well done Mat (and Team) for getting this running. I'm hoping the no compression (100 PSI) is just down to rings not being bedded in........ This is the most likely the reason why it nearly won't start, BTW, the throttles should have been FULLY OPEN when you did the Compression Test (which I'm not sure they were), so it might be ~slightly~ higher than 100 PSI. Hopefully it will come around, and be ok once it's fully 'ran in', fingers crossed.  On the plus side though, at least you know how to strip and rebuild it if you need to do a re-bore............ Keep up the great content, I've been 'glued' to this series so far.....
Love it... I'm just as happy every time a new build starts for the first time so I'm right there with you guys!! Job well done!
The most exciting video I've scene on YT for a long time. Proper suspense.... will it fire, will it fire?
Truly happy for man all the way from south africa you are a true inspiration to the world. Keep up the good work .waited long for this moment.😂😂
This is SO good! Mat & Co you need a TV show commissioning. [although too much would be lost in the edit I guess].
Just awesome
Finally!! can't wait till you get to the cosmetic stuff and make it look sexy  🙌🥳🍾
contagious entertainment..
21:38 good lord she sounded so sweet
Just subscribed 🎉❤
fucking legend.
This build and Fredy's one with the P1, are going to be no clue the most epic rebuilds in history!!
yesssssssss
YESSSSSS ITS STARTEDDDD!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
🙏🏼🙏🏼
Hmmmmm sounds like the Timings out
OOOOOH MY GOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD!!!! (Tears on my eyes...)
Matt I hope those  O rings are  Oil resistant !!
Cool man
That has to be the most satisfying engine start I've ever seen on YouTube, lol.
Awesome
Pretty incredible actually.  Well done.
Great story on this one can’t wait to hear this on the road, sounds incredible!
Please
Awesome 👏
Mat can we please please get more uploads it’s just helps me calm down and relax my mind
Fuck it, it’s not my Lambo. Go off big bro
Loved the video ❤
Matt your a lad 👌🏻
Cool ! Love it. Get it going !
Great job brother!!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
What an excellent finish! I am not ashamed to admit: I was close to tears! 😀
Trending #19
The look on your dads face that was brilliant to see!
im smiling in tears looking your dad’s reaction , he’s a legend
I like the way your dad was so excited after hitting the casing that last time. Woohoo! Wish I had a project that would excite my dad like that. Good job 👍
Why the hell the start of the motor made me emotional like i was watching a "Disney Cars" movie
Hell yeah!!!🎉🎉🎉😅
The smile he got on his face when the car started😊❤❤
Matt,you are the eternal optimist,nothing gets you down,well done mate 🇬🇧🍺🍺ps,can’t wait for its proper paint job
Awesome!! Congrats!!
MATE - SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!
Use a sacrificial feeler gauge on each side and slide it between the o ring and the front cover. That way the front cover slides against the feeler gauge and not the o ring.
It’s Alive🤪🤪🤪😁😁😁🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥im so happy😁😁😁😁😁
Literally hard work pays off 🎉🎉
Your all bloody mad, but I can’t stop watching you all, just magic video
Best video so far Matt
I was willing that thing to start 😁👏👏
Congrats MAT. 👍🇯🇲🍻
Amazing
This videos just make my day man fr fr, keep it up you're so sick and genuine honestly!!
Hes not the first to start the car, you are
Just awesome. Miss working on cars with my dad 😢👏👏
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  I love your work  ❤
Awesome!
When you get that Lamborghini rolling it’s gotta do a mega road trip around Europe.
Only eight minutes into the video where they are trying to reseal the timing cover without taking the heads off. Mate, just do it right the first time. It may be more work but it will save you a lot of headache in the future.
So suspenseful your a horror film director in disguise!
To be honest mat, I think it wanted you to start it
That moment when the Murcielago started for the very first time was like breathing new life into the engine. You’re perseverance Matt is contagious. Rebuilding a car from scratch with your Dad creates memories for a lifetime. ✌️
Well done mat.
yassss so excited to see next video already
Who tunes the car now?
Straight Goosebumpss 21:38 | 22:33 . Such a Triumphant moment!
When are you working on the old BMW?
mat!! you, your dad, your family, and your team are incredible!!!!!! I'm so lucky found your channel!! it's always been a fun ride watching you and your channel grow!!
Great work Matt, well done 😁❤👌🤟🤘
This is quality! Congrats on this massive achievement Matt really keeps a lot of us true petrol heads invested and inspired to sort our own projects big or small! Keep up the good work and hopefully one day will see this beauty in the flesh!
What a fantastic watch .. brilliant crack...
You guys are freaking legends ! So cool to see Freddy here.
So happy for you mate.
Mat, we all know you are a generous guy... how about you dip into the channel funds and buy poor Sara a new pair of jeans? 😉
The way she took her first proper breath and actually came back to life. Beautiful
Oyeil ⚠️
Congratulations fellas
man for a first start the V12 does sound a little bit like a tractor but thats to be expected cause it was rebuilt, u can just hear a faint noise of the iconic old school V12 bellow its gonna give off at high RPM. I cant wait to see the next episode now
Glad to have witnessed this Murcielago journey from the start....   good job Matt and crew esp ur dad!!
Kin brilliant mate I’m made up for you that it started 👍🏻
Love everythink you do and all your content ❤❤❤
sneaky bit of advertising there from the key turner, both rocking up wearing the brand new clean fleece displaying company name😅
Fantastic!! I was grinning ear to ear at the end of this! Excellent job guys!  Your dad is proper having fun! 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇬🇧
I’m on the edge of my seat, can’t wait to see the next episode… superb Mat
Wow mate fantastic job buddy
Am I the only one who was more excited for the actual run of the Murcielago than Mat?
Great video Matt I can’t wait to see it with the exhaust connect and it running, it’s like the video I watched on YouTube to start a Porsche 917
That sound!!
Not having a good relationship with my dad it is so cool to see you guys together take on and work together on your dream car
Congratulations. I been down just checking ever day to see if you put up a new video. You are the only YouTuber that even when things don’t go right. You still have good energy. Can’t wait to see this one complete. What will he do to this one lol be safe love your work stay bless
What a milestone! Well done guys
This video makes me feel old...all my generation wanted a Countach
Why didn't he hug his dad when it started!!
Great episode , it was like watching chitty chitty bang again 😂
Just started watching here in this video, and holy I love this so much from the connection with your dad and just the overall vibe of the video is top tier. Keep up the good work, you have another sun!
Awesome work Matt, you make the seemingly impossible become reality and within the reach of the amateur mechanic. You and your dad are a fantastic team, well done for getting the Murcielago to at least start. 🙂
i have seen old tractors start up easier after 40 years of being parked under a bush. but seeing the old girl sputter alive surely was an accomplishment.
Insanely happy to see the first start of a v12 murceilego after 7 yrs. Also waiting for international giveaways (waiting in 🇮🇳India😅)
I didn’t want the video to end. I cried and smiled all through❤️❤️❤️.  I still have goosebumps seeing this V12 come to life💯. I am a fan for life
i am so happy
Awesome to see it start. I love that regardless of this being a Lambo, you get stuck in regardless and apply your mechanical skills the same as if you were working on any other car.
842,000 Murcielago lovers said in unison "Start ya bastard" - you f'kn rip snorter good thing you - made my night.
Yeeeeeeeeeees! Sounded awesome when all 12 came on song
Your Dad's dance was the best
when you gowing to work on the porse gt3
What happened to that guys girlfriends trousers 😂😂
Go on mat can't belive that bad boy is running. Sounds like a beast
Lee The Legend 👏🏻
Try to push start it
Using those cheapo oil rings from that kit will come back to haunt you.  Those seals are not for high temp and degrade easily.
So good. Wish there was a new vid daily they bring so much joy!
Actually gave me goosebumps waiting & watching it start. Well done Matt 🎉 & everyone
This is unbelievably brilliant.
You've earned my sub with your honest joy and excitement! And I feel quite old now, remembering the launch of the Murcielago many years ago - I was blown away by how sci-fi it looked compared to the Diablo...
brilliant video, such a huge amount of work
Very few channels bring a smile to my face like this one. Nice!
those poor headgaskets
Tell your Dad Matt.  I love his Excitement!  Made my day seeing his celebratory Jiggle jiggle! 😂🎉
So pleased for you getting the car started. It’s been a rollercoaster in the videos watching the progress. I can only imagine what it has been like for you 🙈🤣
Absolute blinder!!!!! Well done lad….
Your tenacity paid off , congratulations mate  🎉🎉🎉
Well Happy for Mat and His dad, all the graft and the headache paying off, had me jumping on the loud pops when turning over the engine
I like see how you and your father work together. Can't wait to see lambo on the road
LOVE FUEL ❤❤❤ .
Absolutely awesome work Mat - Great to see the engine roar into life after all your hard graft.  Looking forwards to the next episode 🙂
you are legend brother 👍👍👍
Quite emotional  watching that fire up 🎉 brilliant 👏
So F’n awesome 🤘🏻🤘🏻🤜🏻🤛🏻
Massive  memories right there Father an Son Build 👌
damnnnn man thst made me genuinely so so happy.... woooohoooooo🎉🎉
YESSSSSS GET IN!!!!! 🎉 So happy to see this video pop up today!
It’s just magical 🥹
Sitting in my office, I could actually smell the exhaust and the smoke coming off the engine...
another great video Matt great work from all involved can't wait to see it finished top job as always.
100k you got ripped off from this  car it's an absolute dog
I hope not but I think your gonna have  problem after problem with this car.
Really enjoyed it !!!! good luck !
By far!! the best YT car video ever made 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻  Hats off to you
"Some bar" is my new oil psi when asked in the garage!  Hahaha 😂
Matt I have been watching this since the beginning and I'm truly happy you got the engine started. You and your dad are legends!
I was genuinely smiling like a child at Christmas the moment when the car finally turned over. Well done mate. Love your content :)
I need Part 11!!!!!!  Great effort guys
Matt, I think I speak for a lot of people on here, it's really special to see the passion you and your dad share for cars. Your relationship is something to cherish, enjoy every second buddy.
Amazing!!!
I've just watched all of Freddies videos about his Fast & Furious Murci rebuild - and then he turns up on here! Haha! That was a funny moment! Between you, DDE, and that build, I know way too much about Murcielagos now.... 😆
I have been watching you for a long long time now. Start to finish I don’t skip but something about the revival of this car in the end part of this episode made me super happy as if I did the hard work . Great story telling capabilities you have man.. can’t wait for the next episode..
All I can say is all I can witness is a man having so much fun repairing the cars he loves what a life 🙏 well done Matt
Looking at this car being taken apart and rebuilt abd seeing the parts Lambo used and the quality of the parts you can really see you are paying totally for the badge name, probably the worst case I have seen. I wanted what a v12 jag s type would of cost in comparison at last sale point
Amazing to see your success Matt, from the S5 to nearly 1m views in 24hrs...incredible!
Big up to Freddie turning up to help. Top bloke
Loving these videos, keep up the good work and it all goes well
<3
Well done getting it fired up ...  amazing amount of work and perseverance to get this far .. no wonder the other engine builder gave up (obviously out of his depth anyway)  ..  can't wait to see and hear it drive .. get in ..
Love the relationship you have with your Dad, next level content!
Genuinely happy for you that it started. Following this from the start, everyman racing is close to my home I’ve seen that car around the area back in the day.  Nice work fella.
Engine: 0 miles , Starter : 20 000 miles
How’s the timing backfiring timing is out hope you have the cams timed correctly otherwise things will breakeh
you should get upgraded motor, controller and battery and make it faster
I won’t lie Matt, but I got quite moshy when the engine started! I was soooo happy for you and your dads hard work! You sir, are a Legend ❤
It's so good to see it start. I'm already looking forward to the next one. 🎉😊
if Mat doesn't end up with an offer of a segment on Top Gear or his own show - I'm thinking Repair Shop but for cars with Mat and his dad - then I'd eat my own pants! In fact I think Mat should pitch the idea.  But online is such a good format. I'm not really a 'car guy' and turning over the engine at the end was nailbiting!
You and your Dad are so awesome! I truly enjoyed watching You both build the lambo together. The ups and downs and the struggles were all worth it. It has been an amazing journey.  Thank you for sharing the ride!!!
So great to hear that sound again eh!
I genuinely clapped when Lee got it started 😂 Huge congrats, it was so obvious you were desperate to hug someone at that moment but didn’t know whether to hug your dad, Lee or the camera guy LOL
What a legend - feel like you should have hugged your dad though
So happy to see the car started. 🎉🎉
Matt’s vids are by far my favourite to watch, just gives you inspiration to want go out and try this, I was so skeptical about buying a crash damaged or salvage car but look at the fun you have plus the reward at the end!
“Have we gotta rebuild it again?” 😂😂😂
The channel just gets better and better! So awesome to see it fire in to life after all the hard work
about time lol nice one
Congratulations Mat, well deserved 🎉
What a moment that was beautiful ❤
One Of The Best Rebuild Channel on Youtube Just keeps getting better😎
excellent in all wayus production cvamera     his dad   the team     tav    and everything
happy for you
I know F all about cars bit love watching this channel
Whoo hoo nearly there 👍🏻👍🏻
Your dad is a boss. Love what you do Matt and it’s great to see Freddy as well in the vids.
Admire your resilience in the face of repeated set backs. Hats off Mat & Team. 💪💪💪💪💪💪
Love everything about this, dad son, v12 lambo, sharing with a stranger, doing it your way, taking advice from a punter.  MA youre a bloody legend!!
What color are you going to paint it, Mat?
Why the fuck am i crying 😢
Why am I so excited to see a car start :D
I'm all happy 🎉 remember when success for first time building engine
Man, I just love watching this channel. I laughed and cheered out loud when that beast sprang into life. Thanks for letting us all come along the journey with you Mat. <3
Great to hear it runs, thought timing was out but when it finally ran if sounded sweet.
Congratulations! All the work was worth it! I cheered when she started....know that feeling well - looking forward to seeing her move under her own power soon.
This was a long time coming and a mother roller coaster!! So happy to see the engine finally running! 😁 Next steps? I want to see this beauty driving and see if that trans is working too.  Another great vid! Thanks Mat!
Classic moment. Well done to the entire team
By the looks of her trousers the girl was attacked by Kevin.🐕😉
Really hoping to see that Lambo running again. Great job guys!
That moment like a child 21:43 !!!!  Respect!!!
Absolutely Amazing
There's only one way to do things. Properly. Take the heads off.  There's no such thing as a shortcut Any risk of damage to the orings is a no no
yes matt you did it !
This gotta be the coldest start ever
I’m so pleased you got that running congrats
🎉🎉🎉🎉
not gonna lie....i had a tear in my eye when it went - it's been great following the journey and cant wait to see it finished. AWESOME JOB and TEAM!
Getting lessons on father /Son bonding
updates on the gt3??
So cool
Awesome! 😀🙌👌
If you got problem with throttle body... Get Volvo.s throttle it fits.. Same company
Ohh, I miss my father so much !!!
Good to see it running. Does sound the timing of something is way off though but I’m sure you’ll get to the bottom of that quickly enough ( if you haven’t already )
Absolutely fab. Tears of joy watching this. Still so much to do, but what an epic milestone. Hug your dad. Shout if out loud. Great to see Tavish too. Brilliant
The dream team….
Awesome ! From 🇳🇿
So good!!! Well done!!
One of the best YouTubers of recent times 🙂
Amazing guys! Genuinely shared your happiness when that started! Big love dude!
Congrats Mat!!!! This has been such a journey.
Freddy how you getting on in the uk have you seen how much everything cost and the uk is getting ripped off you don’t get any cheap cars out of copart here my friend and most of them are fucked and they don’t tell you how bad they really are damaged and once you’ve brought it that’s it you Owen it I say copart should go back to the old days you bid live on the day and you can see what you are buying
Fantastic, nobody ever said it was easy!
man u're a legend!
Can't wait to see more and @Маt please add more fuel inside at least 20lit :)
Yo it was such an amazing journey to witness! I was here ever since the first part vid of murci appeared. Keep being you Mat!
Watching this series for some time now, all brilliant but that at the end was actually emotional - Well done Matt and Guys, seriously good.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
Super cool. Thanks for another enjoyable episode, Mat.
Not a car guy, dont even know how this series ended up in my feed, but i've enjoyed following the last few months and I did give a fist pump in the air when she turned over finally!
LS1  now ?
Great work, and how you should work on engine, alot better than you ever get a main dealers at least you know its been done even if a bodge 😅
Actually had me almost in tears (I said ALMOST - ehem...). Your joy is so plain, Matt and its infectious. Rock on!
Class...  I've never screamed at the TV as much as I did watching this .   Well done 👏 ✔️ 👍 😅
I’m sat here, giddy, kicking me feet as they try and turn the car over. I’m so emotionally invested in this build. Actually audibly laughed with joy when it burst into life. What a moment!!
That actually brought a tear to my eyes....  It will be great to get it fully sorted.  It's been a fantastic and inspirational trip this Murc!
That thing sounds absolutely crazy! Well done Mat - so wild finally getting it started after so long.
Do your dad's dream car next mat please... really sweal guy you have as a father 😂. Do his dream car next
So much joy in this video is awesome can’t wait to see this progress
It literally gave me goosebumps when it fired up and idled. Can't wait for the next Lambo episode.
i love how your dad was laughing!! thats joy right there.
That's gonna sound like an absolute beast when it's finished. Proper enjoyed watching the progress you've made! Keep it up!
A.M.A.Z.I.N.G....Nice one...looks like all the right bits are in the right places...gonna be a howler😜
I love Mats dad, what an absolute hero, maybe he should run tobe the next PM?
Pleased for you and your dad what a grind that’s been hats off to you guys 👍
Lets goooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Murcie is also my dream car. The sound of that v12 is just insane. Can't wait to see it being finished. Are you going to straight pipe it?
I have a idea you should show the guy that you bought it the Lamborghini after months 🎉😮
Make it an SV
Loving all the smiles!
I do not normally comment on these videos, but that was EPIC!!!  The anticipation and willing for that engine to start was awesome. I need a lie down now and Matt, you need your own tv show. peace out !
FREDDIE what u doing here haha go fix the  McLaren . Nice one guys doing great
Been waiting for these patiently🫡
I've never been so happy to see an engine turnover before in my life!!! Awesome job Mat and Team... 👏👏

That beast sounds mental 😍
OMG that's astonishing work
I have a lung disease    Which is   -Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
Great work
What id give to be in your shoes man! The work you have put in is unbelievable! I started watching when you built the aston, watched loads of old vids since, even the tt, I’ve watched the lambo since the start and tbh thought you were genuinely mental, seen the ups and downs you’ve had with it. was genuinely gutted when the oil leak happened previous video, when she fired up my god I couldn’t stop smiling absolutely Amazing Mat!!! Fair play to you and everyone that’s helped you, looking forward to the rest of the build its by far my absolute favourite!!!!
Damn how many unfinished project cars you got man?
Congratulations Matt    I didn't think it was going to start as I thought the timing was out..  Cheers.

the reaction was priceless, well done
I'd of restarted it ahaha
It's been a great journey with the the Merci, can't wait to see the first test drive
Probably you just need to mount the exhaust and tune the control unit, this is why the engine shuts off :)
Great video again Mat! Greetings from the Netherlands 🔥🔥
Wow thats incredible! I also love that a father and son have such cool hobby/business they can work together and hope I can be involved in a project like this with my son when hes older
I do love a good engine build and a first start. 🤪
That must be such a buzz after a monumental rebuild, well done Mat and all involved. First run sounds quite a purrr too.😂😁👍
I don't drive but I wait for your videos, your work ethic is infectious as are the smile and passion. Restore reuse repair.
🙈❤️🙌I'm finally happy
Why didn't you just do it properly and save yourself the headache at least you would've known it was done right. I know you would have spent more money on head gaskets but you would've had peace of mind. Unless you did it that way in the end and I've just waisted 5 minutes of my life typing this without watching to the end. LOL.
I like your relationship between you and your dad having a ball and working great together. Good on you mate.
ITS ALIVE!!!
look @ ur smile. hahaha, priceless matt hahahha,
Yeeessss😂😂😂😂
Best build by far. Awesome.
Love that your involving subscribers on the journey, great video 😊
Where was the smoke coming from @ 5:59 I hope that wasn't the starter taking a dump.
Finding myself excited watching the car start, Beautiful, cant wait to see it on the road
What a Legend, when you’re standing on top of the engine to put oil in it, I was dead😂
Buzzing all i can say is buzzing well done mat and your dad for smashing it, I shouted YESSS when it started haha, keep them coming bro epic content👊🏼
I was screaming at the tele celebrating when it started haha
great advertise for Vans as they re good enough to stick a v12 in a Lambo
Mate I can feel the excitement from Australia! Love it. Can't wait to see it out and about.  PS your dad is a champ 😂
Hell yeah, I was smiling like it is my car 🙃
Wow what an emotional moment to hear that motor start ! 💥🥲 Great job guys, can't wait till the next video.
I am at 19:27 and there is no chance that it wont start. To the moon, Mat!!
Mat, very well done to you and your dad!
“do it once, do it right”. Someone had to say it.
i literally got chills when the car first started! 😬
Friggin brilliant Matt… I was so willing for it to fire up 🔥 top work 🤛
you are my inspiration for at least 5 month ago. thank you so much
Just amazing 👏👏👏 I remember when I started seeing your videos, that girlfriend audi putting the steps 😅 and the bmw serie 1 , changing antenna side lights,etc! Was nice to see you on event last Sunday ! 👍👏👏👌👌 please fix that gap on porches bonnet! 😂😂😂
Why didn't you do everything properly.  Extra work would be eliminated.
Freddie never does anything he just stands there with his hands in his pockets what a waste
You're just a good guy, I'am happy to see fantastic projects from you :) Keep up the good work.
Am I only one who was expecting son/ dad hug? Probably getting old. 😂 but you guys are legends and Your progress with the build makes me so happy, the best YT channel for me!!!!
B R I L L I A N T ! So pleased it started. Well done.
Amazing, so glad it started
Congratulations on getting started onwards to the first drive fella
This is the real meaning of beauty
Hell yeah mate you did it!!! It’s been a long time coming you and your dad are amazing and work great can’t wait to see the this up and running fully and then to the GT3!!  Both your dream cars so close to being done 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Wow !!! That was a great moment when it fired up and your dad is a great lad 😎👍
Matt is such a legend- love his videos so much
Ah I love this. 😁
:-)
Brings a whole new meaning to 'right to repair' 👍
lets take a moment to appreciate the MVP DAD!
The absolute glee on Mats face is awesome! 😁
Amazing video mate 👏🏼 so glad the murcie started 😂
Congrats guys!!! Amazing work just shows it’s finally paying off long live the Murcielago
wow, congrats!!! everything you do here is wonderful. greetings from Romania!
Class been waiting for the update 🤟
I was happy for you guys but at the same time... that clearly doesn't appear to be a proper starting of a lamborghini...lol. maybe it requires the back pressure of the full exhaust?
Bought a teat to my eye the joy of you and ya dad bless ya buddy keep up ya amazing work x
I´m so glad that it's ALIVE! Congratulations to all and especially you and your Dad.
Sitting here in a country, far far away, cheering like a little child when the murcielago started.. It was such a climax!
This is what life is all about! Awesome to see the happy vibes :)
Fantastic, i was clapping when she fired up 🙌👏🤘
Well done Mat 'everyone' 👏 always look forward to your videos 👍👌
Great content,, so enjoyable!
I’ve been waiting for this car to start ever since I seen you drop so much money on the pile of parts and them just saying that it’s all there.
Well done Matt, best thing on YouTube by far. You deserve all the good that comes your way. Peace out 🥓🥓
Ohh you really did it this time Mat, amazing that it did run, so great your dad is helping you out, can't wait for the next vid to come out and see what the next step is. Any news on the GT3 in the states, when is that going to be finished, or at least another vid on it?
What an ending!
You just can’t bodge engine builds especially on a race engine. I know it may seal for now but you want it to last long term.
I don't understand to much english, I understand 0 (zero) mechanical, but I really enjoy the Mat's happiness. I smile for the entire video. Such a wonderful attitude.
The sheer Joy on your face when it started ~ absolutely wonderful!  Really happy for you.
OMG! The elation when it fired! Well done Lee - bricking it much?! The best 25 mins of this week for sure. Nail biting, tense stuff. Did I really fist pump watching on line?!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉👏🏻
I'm suited for you matt. It's also my dream car as a kid. Gutted I didn't get chance to get the chance to have the save the manual tops to be in the chance to turn the key lol. I will never have the chance to own a car like this but I'm suited to see that your living the dream. Go on top lad
unbelievable.....❤
Hope I'm not the only one that cheered out loud when it first started 😂😂
No more waiting finally the V12 came to the life 🎉🎉
Mat is the GOAT
😂 love it I can't believe how happy it made me feel to hear it running 😂 fair play Mat and co good work 👍 I hope it's ok 👌
For future u should have all the spark plugs out too when cranking for oil pressure  otherwise on the compression stroke you load the big and little ends without oil which causes wear. Without spark plugs you don't get any compression so they stay unloaded. Love the videos lad
Amazing!!
IT LIVES!!!!! YEAAASSSSSSS MATT 💥
This father son relationship SLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPS.
🔥🔥🔥
Loved the moment when Tavarish got into the scene! Hahaha so unexpected LOL
Literally had my fingers crossed there for you guys, that was intense!!
finallllllyyyyyyyyyy .......... sooooo happpyyy
You guys are awesome
Congrat's mate, hopping you are not strugguling more for the rest of the engin bay.
So good.
Awesome feel good film, so happy it went.😀
Your dad is quite the co-star of the show😅 Good job!
Nice one Mat……😂
people tell you you cant do that...that makes u want to do it even more! You got my thumbsup!
10 episodes and the hype train has pulled into the station...  CHOO CHOO!!!!!
My old man’s gone, enjoy yours as much as you can.
Can you help me my wife needs a spine surgery please 🙏🏼 help me i don’t have anything left please 🙏🏼
Thank you bro. Enjoyed this video big time. Great vibes
She's ALIVE!
You're one of the few channels I'll drop whatever I am doing to watch a new post. Love every video, never stop what you're doing <3
Not taking the heads off to fit that piece seems like a bad move. I dont see how you can get that seal as tight as fitting 1st then  torquing the head down onto it.
I've got 2 mins left on this video and I'm sitting here in pure anxiety hoping that this thing fires up... literally edge of my seat!!!
Yipeeeeeeee
Awesome job guys. I loved this vid. Me and my step son are rebuilding a ZD30 engine for his Nissan Patrol. I was in the Air Force as a aircraft mechanic. So I have a working knowledge of Piston engines but your videos give me hope that we can do this.
Wow
😂 Great stuff guys!
I was ons the edge of my seat and clapped so hard when that things started!!!what a rush!!!! Good on you and you pop!!
Man the vibes in this video… absolutely immaculate. Cheers to you and your father and the whole team Mat. Could feel the energy through this toxic screen
Congrats for your perseverance and the joint effort with your father. Well done! Keep going --- and laughing!
You guys did such an amazingly good job Mat! Can't wait to see this one on the road after sooooo long🤩🤩
Brilliant video well done!!!
Think your dad wanted a hug at the end…….
Great watch 😀👍
Nice work, out of interest, how much quicker were the 3 attempts to fix the o-ring leaks than taking the heads off?
Congratulations Matt, I was nervous for you 😊
22:33 of the video is probably the happiest moment of my life. Haven't smiled like that
That poor starter motor😢
Awesome! That's super exciting! Can't wait to see it on the road :)
Pro tip from my mechanic mate: Never pull the fuel pump fuse or relay for a test, you'll fire the injectors while dry and possibly full of crap from sitting and the solenoid is cooled by fuel.  Just unplug the crank sensor or pull the ECU fuse.
Shoutouts to referencing DDE haha so awesome to see two Murcielago builds happening together. You should team up with them and get them together when they're both completed.
I cannot honestly say how glad I am to see you get that running mate and every video I watch of yours has so much meaning and feeling to me your a one in a million mate keep it up and by this time next year I look forward to showing you all my projects.
Yes finally 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Amazing Mat! No other words.
omfg I'm sweating mega build can't believe it 😊😊
The fact the belt was “tuned” to a frequency still baffles me… that’s actually insane
Where the hell did Freddy come from?😂
Been waiting so long to see this .. emotional journey man, what an ace video Mat, congrats to everyone involved 👏 🙌 well done ❤
i love the support Mat gets from not just fellow YouTubers but his dad.
Incredible Job Mat and team, you have the patience of a saint! Keep at it!
What was thatblue car
To be honest, u made my day better... a lot )
The joy was palpable , what a fab video from a great team .👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I can say this is the luckiest Murcielago in the world when she meets Matt. You put so much love on it and we feel it. Can't wait to see the next episode.
Flipping brilliant 🎉🎉🎉
This is the only YouTube channel I constantly hit refresh on to see if there’s a new video of this lime green car.  Congratulations on a new beginning for the Murci.
Brilliant. Really enjoyed that episode. Great work everyone involved. Keep up the good work.
This is THE BEST start to my morning
Great work Mat☺️
Well done guys love the videos 😁 😊 all the best Dave in Wellington
Seeing you and your dad do this makes me so happy. My dad would help me with things on my cars and he suddenly passed away 2 years ago, I'd give anything to have him back and do things like this with him, and seeing you guys do this together really makes me so, so happy.  Please never stop, cherish every moment you can together.
✌️😎🔥💥
Your a legend.
I think what makes Matt’s content so good is his understanding of *story*. Find me another channel that understands rhythm and pacing like this - every 20 minutes is an absolute breeze to watch, and it’s because he doesn’t waste a second on anything the viewer doesn’t need to see. Along with management of tone (reversals and setbacks), use of music and knowing where to end each vid so the viewer is satisfied but still wants more.   Basically you’re a great editor Matt - no idea how you find the time to do it all alongside the rebuilds and the travel!
Hahahaha, its on 😂🤣😂👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 love it !!! I wish I had a dad like yours, and your patience Mat. Legends 🥳
Another great episode.
The hardest working auto content provider on the internet. Terrific presentation. Great video. Congratulations 👍
Almost broad a tear to my eye of happiness!
congras
Congratulations! It was so exciting and happy to it start.
Had the biggest smile on my face when it actually started 😁😁😁
excellent work
To see your dad so happy is brilliant
I agree with barry. Build something for your dad matt.
Hey bud, you ever gap them rings?
Reckon I could borrow your dad for a couple of hours? Get the 928 started… 😆 we can talk about getting him back for the Lotus Esprit Turbo later. 🤣
I've been waiting to see this lambo come back to life
I've seen a lot about dry-ice cleaning. Would be nice to see the car cleaned fully and looking brand new after it's mechanically done. Don't know what the costs are, but just an idea. It's magically interesting how clean stuff gets with that
Haha Classic well done
Haha Classic well done
Awesome Mat!👍👍Congratulations on this milestone!Supporting you all the way from Namibia in Africa
Big congrats Mat. And thanks for the Carvertical 10% off!! I did 2 reports. Dutch regards Nico.
Brilliant. Pure testament to patience and passion. Well Done!
Epic result!
The Beast has finally awakened
Is that really your language/reaction when the oil comes out? Or do you have to record another reaction and edit in the bit we see?????
The beast is alive!!
EPIC Just so cool
Awsome  Great work & Persistent
Got my cereal ready 😅Time for some actions
Well that gives tuning your engine a whole different meaning 😂
luv it~~~~ rebirth of the lambo
The sweet sound of a V12!!!
Well done guys and great to see Freddy there as well
Great video such iconic car 🤙🏾
I don’t understand why you never clean everything before you put them together???
Congrats dude!
Love this chaps motivational can do attitude and outlook.  What a great Father Son relationship.  You are helping us all to be better people...thank-you
After months of work and assembling, hearing the engine running is something truly mental. No surprise that Mat's reaction is honest. I was feeling the same behind the screen. Truly one of the best channels on YT. Keep the good work, and see you next time :)
It’s like that scene from Rocky when he sprints up the steps …”Gettin Stronger” music in the background! 😄 I think you owe your Dad a pint ….. well done 👏👏👏👏👏 take a bow son!
I actually cried when the engine started. Good Luck Mat!!!,
Absolutely fantastic buddy. Great to see you, superb edit and turned around in super quick time. Go Matty!!
Freddy’s got balls of steel wearing white shoes right now 😂   Congratulations to you all. 🎉  Came for the GT3, got so much more.  Your dad is the MVP.
Great work the sound is impeccable 🎉
that was sick! loved it!
That was epic!
i can tell matt supressed 90% of how he truly felt when it first fired up, he probablly wanted to jump off the walls😂, proud of you man, such a huge achievment and milestone you've hit, can't wait to see you drive it!  ps ngl but i lowkey love seeing freddy in your vids, he's like the fairy car mother that appeared when you needed him most, sucha wholesome dude🔥
Epic.👍🇬🇧🦊💙
His dad doing the highland jig was the highlight of the vid such a shame in that attempt the seals still leaked at that point
That was some Chitty, Chitty bang bang action!!!!
The bill now must be in pimp money scale by now 😂. What the costs add up against a “running” one now?
Massive achievement well done Mat and team really enjoyed watching this I’ve been looking out for this video 😂 so exciting. I love the detail you go into showing us everything even the price of parts etc. It’s great to see your dad get stuck in what an amazing guy. Also seeing all the other YouTubers getting involved and helping you out with the build is so good for the channel. Well done can’t wait to watch more.😊👌🏻
Personally, If I have that much trouble with the oil leaks, I'm pulling the heads and doing it properly. I understand why some wouldn't though. It's a lot of time and expense.
Hairs on the back of the neck feeling
Phenomenal Matt pissing my self with laughter at the sound of that beast.
The excitement in your face shows you really care about what you do . Which why I like your videos 👍🦾
Well done guys, truly fantastic work and hearing that engine start and the 12 cylinders roar into life makes it all worthwhile. 👍
Absolutely brilliant!! well done Mat... 👍🏻
Hi I think you can see the mileage of the car by connecting to a computer look in the ABS or main ECU let me know if it works 🤞🏼
I love your Italian greyhound. We just lost ours and it brought a smile to my face and heart 💜 rip ruby 😢
That’s an amazing outcome, congratulations!
Great video as always, one of the best channels on YouTube! Do you need an apprentice? 😊
Wow mat jus wow🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that's pure joy, Mat! I wish I can go to UK to start one of your project!
I can’t not believe how talented you and your guys are keep it up love the content 🎉
Dad and son... Plus BHP
Sooo many ads 🙄🙄😅
That was Awesome Mat 💥💥💥🙌🏽
Always wondered what a 2 stroke Lamborghini would sound  like, now we know. In all seriousness we'll done to you all getting this far can't wait to see the finished article.
The channel growth is insane and fully deserved! 👏🏼
I hope you will call Mr Lee back when the car will be fully repaired and give him a ride.
Malaysia 🇲🇾✅
What a great way to start my day.  06:30. Sat in a train, smiling to my self. Thanks Mat. She’s lives 😮
Your Dad's excitement has just made my day.
Shout to Mike Essa (DDE) for his knowledge, and shout out to you Mat for applying the knowledge.
Freaking AWESOME! You guys look like you're having a blast! Between the purple and green I can't wait for the next episode.
Amazing 🙌🏿😅
Can't wait to see the Murcielago fully sorted.
Hell yea
Can’t stand your accent
Hearing that roar to life is any petrol heads wet dream, amazing
21:35 I think I cried a lil when that V12 came back to life.
2:22 u are doing a mess. omfg dumb idea
Awesome!!!
It's an indescribable moment, I shared the start with you and everyone in that garage. I was very happy when the engine started and you could hear the sound after adding gas. These are the moments when emotions shoot up, you let out a loud breath, your heart starts pounding like church bells and then you feel relieved that you made it. Super episode and I'm extremely glad that I could see it and share that  moment with you Mat.
Its like seeing the baby walk for the first time 🥲
What a YouTube moment. Well done team.
Tavarish just pops out of nowhere
Watching since that bmw 1 series and now he is starting his v12 murci. Crazy and well deserved. 👏🏼
Congrats Mat, never seen you like this on any of your videos!!! hahaha so fun
Mat, i just want to thank you for your hard work. Keep it up and never lose that smile while your doing what you like. I was super happy when the v12 started roaring flames, it was awesome to see it running after all this time. Congrats, i cant wait to see this car on its way to monaco.
I will always admit when I'm wrong...I was one of the.brigade that said you should ditch the Merci and put the money in other cars....I was wrong...though I do reckon your Dad has saved you about 70k of work...top top effort! 👏👏👏
Am I the only one who absolutely loves how happy his dad is? He seems to enjoy every minute he spends with Mat fixing the Lambo, it puts a huge smile on my face
I prayed to my Dad for it to start and it did So Happy my Hero's were in this video T is Badass he built Lambos I miss my pops we had more to do 😢 but he's in heaven so my dream is to get a 7 bus window VW he had one with a 911 Turbo motor on a 4 speed not sure year I can't ask him and no one remembers. I wished to build one in his honour. Jack is name. He loved banging gears in his cars.
I love your out of the box thinking,  for some reason I find you relatable despite your crazy lifestyle. Keep the awesome content coming.
ITS ALIVE !!!
Well Done Matt! This has been a long journey. Thanx for sharing it with us!😎👌
was shooting flames like a spit fire
One of the best rebuilding channels on the internet… not gonna lie even better than tavarish
Brilliant Mat well done 😊❤❤
My Sundays now consist of me looking forward to bed time to watch your weekly uploads. Never stop fixing cars. Thanks
How can you put so much effort in your dream car but wont do important steps like with the oil problem how they are telling you how to do it properly ?! Its like your working on a 2k trash car like these weird car dealer that try to hide engine problems cheap as possible to sell it to the first idiot that comes by…
Absolutly stunning...you're crazy...and all the others...specially your dad ;-)
Yes guys go on 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I am so glad that you realise your dreams. I keep my fingers crossed for the success of your project. Regards.
It's enough to make a grown man cry
like starting a small merlin
it’s incredible how happy I felt for someone I don’t know, months in the work Mat and you are still showing us how positive you are! Can’t wait to see what’s next 🙌🏽
Mat you’re such a legend and so is your dad!
Can't wait to here it Run!
At long last, can't wait to see the upgrates
Congratulation’s are in order🎉
If your doing it for yourself do it the best you can for the best results
18:38 cigarette smokers take note on how to blow O rings
That first start up was soo epic! Proper happy to see your dad genuinely happy
Yessssss!!!!! It started that's wats most important....love the team work from everyone coming together to help U put the engine where it belongs... Congratulations Mat.... Well done!!!
can't wait for the next video!!!!!!! congrats
surprised seeing freddy there.
I wish I had a dad like yours 🥰
we've all been waiting for this moment.... well done boys !!! more to come........
Fantastic Matt and team, worthy result, compelling viewing 👌
🎉
That v12 Growl 🤌🏻
Do it right or do it twice….or do it three times.
I can absolutely feel connected to you guys and those efforts are always always fruitful as you do it from the bottom of your heart. ❤ lots of love from INDIA
Holy Lamborghini's. This was amazing. I suddenly realised that I was holding my breath, I was sweating when I finally breathed out and it's not even my car! Congratulations all round mate!
Actually insane
U need to let that rtv and lock tight cure before dumping oil in with it still wet. Nothing will seal well if it hasn’t cured
Been watching this project from the start, great to see it fire up!
I wish my dad was as cool as yours 😭
Drama. Suspense. Everything anyone could want in a video...and it's about starting a Lambo! Brilliant!🤩
Weird coincidence this was posted on the same day I got my first engine swap running
love your channel so much Mat, your energy, everyone's energy, your dad's support, what a great channel, I'm glad I subscribed!!!! Every time a new video uploaded it makes my day😂
Nice Matt!
That poor girl needs some new jeans 🥰🤣
That's killa so happy for you bro love the show and can't wait to see the lambo, all done, just a quick one I'm not sure about lambo engines but maybe not having the full exhaust on you might not have enough back pressure in the exhaust system that might explain the struggle to start brother man, keep smashing it!
This Lamborghini project is similar to watching a movie can't wait to see lambo roaring on road
When the murci comes to live in all of its glory, i think it deserves some recognition certificate from Lamborghini. Matt and his Dad not only rebuild the engine, but also the electrical too... top notch 👍
Konten yang Sangat bermanfaat saya tunggu konten selanjutnya thanks for sharing
This was epic! I'm excited for you Mat! cant wait to see this thing firing on all cylinders and running
Aa man the excitement is Real.  As we are warching this we are all come ooooon come ooooon do it.
Whoooo!! YEAH BAAAABY!! BADASS!!
Those generic O rings are going to fail on you. You need to use Orings that are for OIL. Those generic ones are going to swell and fail.
The extra thin shim holding the o-ring in the head whilst sliding the cover on was brilliant   Shout out to that guy
YYEEESSS!!!!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS
i have been thinking,with a bit of maching,surely as long term fix,you could onsert cowl alignment,that are used in many heads to align cases and seals,but stay in,no more oil
Her jeans tho
how cool man literally building a Lamborghini with you dad.
So very pleased for you Matt, thought you mad as a box of frogs doing this, but proved me wrong, really well done
All I can say is you bloody legends . Well done to Matt and his Dad ... Great stuff... Love the channel 🎉
Finally starting Mat! Viewing from the Philippines since day 1 of the build! Congratulations
Mat you’re an amazing person watching you put a big smile on my face , absolutely you have an awesome dad love how down to earth you guy’s are all the love from the USA
Woow this episode is so epic Mat. So much respect from Tanzania East Africa.
"poor bodywork, poor repairs and an engine that was only done up finger tight' Brah, that's not from someone neglecting it, that's just from the factory XD
Kinda sketch oil seal job. Would have been better to just take the heads off and do it right.
The JOY!! 2.35!!! Absolute LEGEND!
Addictive stuff Matt absolutely love this channel ❤️
Awesome!
Much respect and love from a big fan in tunisia
First time in my life, I had actual tear in my eye by someone firing up a cars engine. Just beautiful.
what a journey
You couldn't have scripted that better and no Hollywood special effects would have come closer to the drama ! Amazing! Amazing guys!
When the mercy started i saw you and your fathers pure joy and it truly made me smile! Amazing work guys
great job, one of your best videos ever!!!
Dam i was clapping and cheering like crazy at my pc with all of yas....Nice work Matt and Your dad.
hoefully it didn't start spewing oil again..
Why did you BUY it? if it was Abandoned That means No One wanted it. It would be FREE then.  If you Bought it, then Someone OWNED it. So therefor NOT ABANDONED.
Great work bro
I think I was more happy then u wen the car starts it man what a journey 😮
Best feelings when the project car starts 🎉
I've said before and I'll say it again, your dad gets to drive that car whenever he wants.
I find it crazy that he had an external engine
I was waiting last night and refreshing your page Mat. Dude you are down to earth! You and your Daddy rock 🍻 🍻
Congrats bro. I know it's been a struggle train but man hearing it fire is an amazing feeling
Man this build is crazy
What an emotional roller coaster!!!! Keep up the killer content Matt!!!!!!
What!! My YouTube favorites are together again!! Love it.
Matt u deserve so many awards for your hard work and dedication. Your show on youtube is so much better then regular TV shows
Well F**king done lad absolutely buzzing for you.. a lot of serious time and hard work has gone into that car you and your dad should be absolutely proud of yourselves keep up the amazing hard work can’t wait to see the final results of this amazing car 💯💯💪🏾💪🏾
Wow,  I can’t wait for the next video. Please upload it ASAP 😁.  I know, I’m a bit excited.  Yeah, not a bit might be too much excited. You guys are legends.❤
yes!!! happy to see the murcielago start! bonus to see Tavarish!
MORE!!!!🤘
Absolutely amazing to see! 😢😭🫡
Oh man you really don't know how long I've been waiting to hear and see this!
You need to keep showing us you compassion for ruined beautys brought back from the dead your videos keep my motivation for building my car
Well done.... Sounds awesome...
You would think that a European would know how to pronounce murcielago.   Do you also say "porsh" ?
MATTT PLEASE HELP ME FIX MY GOLF GTE ADVANCE, I am your biggest fan and I love your videos. I bought a golf gte advanced from co part and it is in progress of a rebuild, unfortunately I’m stuck on the electrics and maybe you can help me tune it and make it a fast/economical Vw gte. It is a 2017 cat N bought it a year ago and I have been stuck, please help a subscriber I’ve been loyal to your channel and liked every single video as it really entertains me. I have also watched your golf rebuild over 100 times yet i can’t seem to compare it to my gte to repair, it is really difficult.
Actually have tears in my eyes when she started!
thats a 'hallelujah' moment.
Absolute growler! She's fiery. Love
What happen to the porsche ? is it going to get finished ?.
Not removing the heads seems really sketchy. Who knows if it'll hold up under hard driving.
Always waiting your progres on rebuilt the car.. ❤️❤️❤️ From Bali island
Your dad went for the hug, such a noble heart ❤
Man you have more commercials then TV
I'd love to see that Lamborghini in electric purple. ❤
so excited watching that first start
So happy for you! Just needs a tune probably. But you'd know that. ;-)
🥺🥺🥺🥺 finally
guaranteed to leak again
That actually made me smile like a teenage girl watching romantic movies.
Well, that was tense, but you got it over the line. Good luck, guys 👍🏻
he said " Not quite 6 bar just some bar 🙈🤣
Smashed it
This video here is why we gear heads/patrol heads love cars. The guys and gals getting together to help resurrect a Murci and huge plus in getting your father involved into your projects. Lost my dad a few years ago but he was the reason I’m into cars, he helped me rebuild my daily driver and he was so proud of that project. Love your videos Mat! Keep up the great work.
The amount of stress that I was living it's crazy. It's 02:00am but when it started I scream my lungs out 😂 sorry neighbors 😅
I don't even like cars and find myself waiting for these videos to be posted every week
WHERE IS THE GT3RS
This was magical Matt. Really. I felt like I watched a sleeping dragon wake up. The end of this project is going to be epic
Congrats bro! The look of pure joy when that fired.
so good
Congratulations to you and your dad on a great achievement!  Been following this build from the start and it's nail biteing stuff. Looking forward to more cheers.
That open header exhaust is music to my ears! Sounds freaking awesome! Great work Matt,from you and your pops!!! Nice to see this project gaining some momentum on its final lap to the finished line!🙏💪👍
All teh youtubers getting mad shine time 🤣🤣
Brilliant! ---Now time to get to work on repairing that poor girls jeans!!
Awesome.
The smile on your dad’s face, priceless!!
And the bull "Roars"..your persistence has been rewarded!!! Good job 👏
Congrats!!! I follow the process from 🇨🇱 Chile!!! Was really exciting see how that motor sounds 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
great work bro can’t wait to see the porsche tho
That was such a wholesome moment when everyone clapped when the Lamborghini started. Amazing vid as always
9:31 I’d rather do it properly than find out at hi revs and higher oil pressure oil squirts all over hot exhausts and goes 🔥
Congrats nice work!
your enthusiasm inspire me, well done

Outstanding! I've waited so long for this!
All those pops and bangs, she’s out of timing
Drive these cars for weeks there horrible to drive
Brilliant to see it start up Matt, all yours and your dad and the rest of your teams hard work paying off! ❤
Bentley rolls Royce Maibach fantastic
Every mechanic puts engine's back in a car hoping there ok,it's just about trusting your ability. No short cuts!.
From my experience driving these cars you name it I’ve driven it there’s all bad
No accidents? So, the body work is decorative?
Is it crazy that my eyes started sweating ? Go on Lad !! Hard work pays off
Damn was that exciting!  Awesome. So happy for you and your dad.  Well done
Your videos are so addictive, I really enjoy them when you put them out.
Im really happy for you and your dad for turning the dream into reality 🙌🙌🙌 huge impact 🤞💪 it raaaan 🏎️💨💨💨

This video is lovely mat but I am still waiting to see you rebuild the Porsche gt3 that is is going to be epic when finished can’t wait
Congratulations on getting the murciélago started. Really enjoy your videos. Big fan from Miami, Fl.
this is amazing bro i can't wait to see the murcielago on the road. hail from Chile
Always gotta watch til the end for any bloopers haha
MEDIUM LEFT SAMIR
A wild Tavarish appears.
Watching that beast roar to life after all your hard work brought me to tears.
Honestly couldn’t be happier to see this.
Was grinning from ear to ear when it started 😂that was top
Finally! Great job guys!
😂👍👍👌
How good was this episode?!
That was awesome hearing her turn over. Lambo’s have the most amazing sound
freaking love ur videos pls do more builds u rlly make my day. listening to the V12 roar keeps a smile on my face
Reminds me of my dad.  He’s always like, oh we can do this without doing that.  He will figure out creative ways to get things accomplished when we are working on cars 🤓
l,ove that Freddy appeared
I watched this video twice. The smile on your face made me as happy as you were, like it was my Lambo starting for the first time. You work so hard you deserve to be that happy.
I find so much inspiration in your videos.  Thanks for posting.  It is great to watch as I'm taking a break from the struggles of getting my wife's 2015 LR 4 (Discovery 4 in the rest of the world) timing right.
Got a bit teary when lee was able to start it for the first time
Amazing ! I’ve been waiting for this for so long man !  Great feeling when it sparks in to life 👍
🥲that was awesome
it probably runs like crap due to the fact that the what, 4 mass air flow sensors are not connected with their lines?
i love how Mat's dad just laugh every time they hit another bump..
This is alot of progress ❤ the vibe was fun watching the key turning
i see RTV coming to a oil gaily near you.
Pure persistence , so cool.
Your old man is the best!!
Man, I was so happy for everyone involved, just pure joy on everyone's faces.
Congrats Lee, both for winning and for sharing such an earned moment in this build history
Hell f@cking yeah!!!!!
Congratulations glad to see it start up
great content from a great man ( & you too Tav' ). what is the name of the sound analyzer app' you used please?
Mat, I am on the other side of the world and I still was clapping that engine on. I can't believe how far this build has come and I cannot wait for the next ep!!!!!
YES!!!!!!!! I waited too long for this,  great job Matt!!! to you and your dad and friends! Let’s go!!!
Ferrari use hertz to adjust their belts as well.  Sounds (excuse the pun) sketchy but apparently that's the way the Italians do it.
Sunny at bhp now his stuff pal that i no you can tell .
Well done from the US!!  I'm restoring a 1985 VW Scirocco I drove off the lot new in 1986 and am so close to my first start in 17 years!  Can't wait!  You provide a lot of inspiration to keep going.  Great work Mat!!  Maybe someday I'll work on a car like yours.
Good for you and the team. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching the process.
01:39am and I’m here and heard it all 👏👏
Ahhhh man this was so wholesome this genuinely made me smile👏
I love how much commercial television can learn from Matt and his team. Content is king. Happily watch any sponsorship messages to help support this amazing channel!
You just made me smile, man. Your honest joy transfers directly to us viewers.  All this hard work finally pays out.  Thank you.
Hooooraaaay!!!
Congrats Mat!!!! Just fired up an old `63 Beetle after 40yrs parked and I can feel the exact same excitement from you!!! Tear of joy!!! High five to you and your pops!!
a dynamic key ? No , you don 't need it . assembly order ? no is not important.  a sledgehammer liter of sealant is all you need to repair a lamborghini. 🤣👍  I haven't seen anything like this yet 👍👍👍👍
this as got to be the best one yet fella .well done guys
You are a legend father/soon 👏👏👏👏👏👏
It’s just a guy fixing a car but it’s so emotional 😂 I had everything crossed for you matt 🤞another great video:)
wicked brother
Amazing result, well done for taking on something that anyone with no engine experience would shudder and hide at! Keep up the work and what an amazing feeling for the fella who made the first start!
Awesome! You look sooooo happy at the end. I wish I was happy.
CONGRATS ALL ,,👏👏 WELL WORTH THE WAIT 👌
A YouTube video drop that I always get excited about when I see. Always puts a smile. Congrats, Matt, 👏
I love everything you do. Good wholesome fun watching your videos keep it up bud
Sounds good...Might need a little computer tuning...Get it running smooth....
LETS GO!!!!! Can't wait to see the Murci on the road!!!!
Best channel 👌 i really enjoy seen you work on this car, and all other project!!! I have to say that is fun to see you work with Tavarish sometimes, really hopes we re gonna see you guys more having fun together on crazy project!!! Cheers from Montreal!!!
Glad I found this channel 🙌.. Thank you for the genuine content.. Keep on keeping on
Bro, I got legit sad and almost cried when it leaked oil again.
That was awesome hearing that starts up, especially when you do know that would be me as well. I want to be responsible for. Yeah that sounds awesome. Sounds even better when you when the exhaust is on when you’re due. When is the bodywork get revert to summer?😅😅😅
Wey aslo bien no le pongas resistol 😄
Legendary content, Matt you keep saying sketchy but mate you haven’t seen half the sketchy stuff the Italians do making these cars.. your is levels..
I just can’t stop smiling 😊❤️. Great work guys 👍🏻👏
Every video you bring out is your best yet! Sky is the limit for this channel
how dummy do you have to be ???
Love your videos bud, keep up the awesome work and inspiring us all.
well done
Awesome cant wait see it on the road Mat!!🎉
Cant wait to see it rockin in the road matt love your videos from philippines
Awesome start ❤
Love the channel Matt you have a great Captivating high energy channel and just come across as a great appericate human being !!!!! Good thing you did an engine rebuild imagine a murci engine doing a 125,000km on track that's insane .
Mat's dad's laugh is so infectious 😂😂....when this build is finally done it coz of the dad's effort..what a legend
Waiting for the next vid when it's running correct.
ITS ALIVE! 👍👍😁😁
Mat and his dad’s relationship is my goal for mine and my sons relationship! All the car stuff is just a bonus
Awesome.
Timing
Good program. But that car is a heap of scrap. Engine will never be right
Mat a legend as always.. Looking forward to the next lambo and porsch videos. All the best from Malaysia.. and remember to forget those trolls. Keep on rollin man
Goddamn, congratulations to the whole team !!!
Been following this for a while, such a proud moment for you and your dad 👍
I spent my whole Ramadan watching your videos, this video is close to my heart
The father / son teamwork and mutual respect is so uplifting. Mat is the talkative front man, but at appropriate times, he defers to his dad. Equally, Mat’s dad is a modest guy and a lot of the time, he’ll discuss with, rather than tell, his son. And both of them laughing like drains when the Vee Twelve lights up properly (definitely sounds like it’s running on all cylinders because it’s so freaking smooth, a malevolent single tone from the exhaust).  Other father son petrol head channels are Vice Grip Garage (Derek & his boys) and also Lee Johnson (motorcycle racing) with his lad, Jessie. Enjoy!
ya tavarish is there!
Funny thing is if you turn on auto generated subtitles when you start the car it says [music]... Youre right YouTube, thats music to all our ears!
Congratulations on that engine! To finally hear it roar is absolutely heart warming. ❤
Best channel on youtube! Such a amazing team! Lee's a lucky chap! Can't wait till this is screaming down the road 😍👌🏻
finalement
Thank you for this video
I can’t wait to hear about startup after all this time. I hope it starts with no problems.😅😅😅
that dude had no reason coming to uk for a colab, but a fantastic one it was!!! 😎💪 Cheers Tavarish for coming across the pond to visit us here in uk. looking forward to seeing that p1 🏎️🔥🔥🔥🔥
Your timing is a mile out. 😊
Give your dad a hug Matt!
Man this honestly made me tear up a bit seeing all you guys smiling and having fun and your dad seems to have so much fun when he's around you. Thank you as always for sharing your amazing content with us Mat. It's so clear how passionate and dedicated you are to these projects. Awesome video as always!
It’s alive! 👍🏼🙌
Good to see Freddie this side of the Atlantic giving moral support
Glad it started!
Mega, I jumped for joy when I fired up. LOVE IT. WAY TO GO.
Tavarish just randomly spawns out of nowhere.
I love these videos . Brilliant 🎉
What an exciting moment 😂😂😂 ! Regrads from Venezuela, Big fan over here haha
Proud of you for not giving up on it . An I hope you enjoyed doing it with your dad .  I wish my dad was still around to help me or even see how I’m doing , he died at a early age . Thanks for letting me watch . I feel like I was apart of it.
Wow what a climax!
Woohoo 🎉
super sketchy,  but i like it that way
too sick - keep it going lads!!
So awesome to see that legend started up and running. Keep going! 😂 😎
Don't use those orings on the engine bro..
song at the very end?
YOOOO SHOUT OUT TO KEEPS! Freddy's hairline is coming back from the grave with more life than the Murci!!!!
I actually cheered and clapped!
love the passion you have for this car.......
Awesome reaction from all of you there. Chuffed to bits for you
Woooooo!!! Matt, Matt's dad and Freddy come on legends!!
Please have the fuel injectors tested/flowed/cleaned. Next time if you think it is flooded, floor the throttle during starting, and keep it there untill it starts (flood-clear mode) Cheers, Robin
Damn bro its finally alive now
Its because its a real European car and the wheel is on the wrong side
If you “start lifting and bolt on the water pump “ why is the next line “we haven’t got the water pump on “ ?
That was a fun one. !!
enjoyed that episode
I got so excited to hear it start! Can't wait for the next 1
I’ve waited a long time for this. My eyes teard up seeing it run. It’s also so amazing to see your dad and you enjoying this project so much. Respect man!❤❤
goosebumps
Lamborghini Mercy.
Kinda sad that dad didn’t get a shot at it too
Getting bloody close!. Good on you Mat!.
Did you fry the engine?
Man congratulations 🎉 I am from Texas watching you I know this takes time jajaja my heart was pounding like I was there great content keep it up
Congratulations keep up with the great work Matt 🎉👍
Your laugher and positive vibe is extremely infectious.  I caught myself smiling when you were willing the engine to turnover.  I hope you truly love what your doing, because I love watching your videos.  Super 🎉
Wow what an absolute rollercoaster this project has been. Been watching this from all the way down under here in Australia and have managed to get pretty much all my mates hooked too. We were all out on the beers on Saturday night and the topic of conversation for a lot of the night 'The Murcielago'. Can't wait to see the finished product Mat, Dad and Co 🙌
thats awesome
Final effin lee
By far the best Automotive YouTube channel. Love the content! Good job Matt!
Well done on getting it started. what a feat that is from it's original state!
I don't think I've ever smiled so hard in my life 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Sonds like timming
Your dad is very important part of this proyect! Congrats for him to!!
So pleased for you mate been waiting a long time for this. Well done to you and your dad. Amazing
I was sitting on the tip of my chair and cheered the moment the murci turned alive! What a thrill this engine rebuild has been.. One word.. Epic! Kudos to you, Matt and your dad🙏🏼
It will sound so good when the remaining things are sorted out.  Following this series since last year and I'm really happy for you matt, it felt like it was my own car which just got revived and put a huge smile on my face.
Well done !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^ YEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT START !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was running out of patience to see another video on this beast
Wait, Travarsh is there???? I thought freddy was back in US. Amazing video though!!!
I agree with @Berry K. Building your dad's dream car would be awesome. If love to see that. Greatest dad in the world. Glad you finally got the car started. Can't wait to see it finished.
I think the most frustrating thing is that if they would have just pulled the heads the first time it would have been way faster.
DDE x Mat is needed
Matt that was epic you and your dad are legends your face said it all can’t wait to meet you one day, that Lambo is savage
Next we want an SVJ build
You sure that smoke not coming from the starter motor? 😂👍🏻 good job man
What happened to the BMW???
I feel like I just had sex and didn't bust @ wondering why the engine wouldn't stay idle and if it's okay
So glad it started. Can't wait to see this get back together fully and on the street. Keep up the amazing work. Love all your videos and always look forward to the next one
Well done to you and your dad. You could never have done that without your dad. Bless him.
Matt im dying to see the updates on your projects! please we need more videos. 23 mins went by so fast im crying haha
DDE! Glad they (Mike) could help! Amazing videos Matt
That sounded so good! Can’t wait to see the drive
Man..... i teared up when Lee cranked it over !!!  Congratulations to you all !!! Great work  !!!
FINALLYYYYY
I am SOOOOOOOOO FREAKING HAPPY for you!!!! Well done fella!!! Top job!!! What a sound!!! Spray her bright orange and enjoy every bloody second of your hard work!!!
Such a good video. The anticipation for the engine was amazing. But was worth it. Start up was sick
I’ve been watching your journey on here waiting for this moment, probably “almost” as much as you have. I am so proud of what you and your father have done, and love watching you both. Congrats a million from a fan, who ironically lives about 30 minutes from your Florida USA project. Best wishes man, and can’t wait to see what happens next!!
Ive loved watching this build mat! It’s great that you’ve got to do it with your dad, I hope one day I can do something similar with my son
I reckon u should just straight pipe it out of the bonnet 😂
Well done team👏👏👏👏👏 I actually fist pumped when that engine fired up it was epic.
This car has been a real project... Full engine rebuild to actually having it start is absolutely brilliant. When you bought it, I was thinking that this was going to be epic. So far it hasn't disappointed. Can't wait to see this car actually fully restored, given your personal treatment, and screaming down the road.
Watching your videos makes me genuinely happy and motivated.. cheers man you’re the best 🔥
That happiness when it started 🥺❤️❤️❤️
21:22 Wow that build up was so dramatic.
Well done Matt and the team bet you was well glad to hear the lambo run? Keep up the good work ❤
And finally I worked 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congrats man 💯💯💯💥💥
Having followed through this for all those months, I was emotional just to see that car crank. Indeed patience and persistence does pay. Cant wait to see you do a roadtrip in it.
Awesome that sound when you start it up is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.cant wait to see you finish the car ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.
I think the "literally finger tight" clip has become a meme 😂😂😂
congratulations ❤😂
man, Matts dads dance is easily the peak of this channel. Pure joy
Congratulations 👏
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I honestly dont know how you have the patience for these projects. I couldnt do it but very glad you are for my viewing pleasure

Amazing content that you can watch for free. Thanks Mat💪
I actually clapped when that started!l felt the tension in my living room!   Amazing. Well done 👏🏻
First and last start then?
That was MEGA man! GET IN!!!!!
The like button alone is not enough for this video! I was celebrating just as much as you when she fired up 😂🥳👏
I like the video Mat I'm guessing Tavarish is in the UK grabbing parts for his Mc claren ,lol
Did I see a start up in the thumbnail?!?!?!! Can’t wait to watch this no matter the outcome. Oh wow Freddie is there!!!! Bang on this should be great. PS I think he has a Mclaren for sale in the near future.
That moment, when 7 years or nothing gets thrown out of the exhaust...Amazing
Lol🎉 this is so nice
Your father son bond is incredible. Keep it !!! Great work
Solid progress💯😁😁
the anticipation .. can't stop smiling .. and realtime i am still waiting for lee to show up .. what a video .. what a story .. well done mat .. :)

Mat-  This video was just edited... PERFECTION!!!   The blended background music through cuts, angles, sped up cuts, WOW.
Congratulations on starting the car can’t wait until it’s restored.
Mat you and your Dad are legends. Absolutely brilliant to see the fruits of all the hard work come to life. Enjoy Gents. 🍾🥂🎉🎉.

Top job
We want Porsche updates!!!
That was amazing watching it splutter back to life, you have saved that engine
Great job buddy so glade you and your Dad are doing this together
Well that didn't sound too happy! Hopefully you're just missing a couple sensors since it isn't fully assembled and the exhaust isn't all the way on.
That was tense! Wow. Congrats
Naaarrrr
Absolutely over the moon for you Matt. Top video like usual and the excitment yourself and your dad have from rebuilding this engine to finally hearing it start is so inspirational.  BEST YouTube channel there is!

Hi Mat, good one and finally the murci has started but it sounds that it’s not timed right, if I were you I’d get a strob light on it just toe be on the save side!
OMG The Lambo ALIVE🔥🔥
WA-ah pUMp
Tavarish we see you
As soon as it fired up I had such a smile on my face. From one Leicester lad to another, well done mate your smashing it 👏👏
Wonderful job Mat, it is so amazing to younwork with your dad man❤️  Lamborghini is coming back to life again!!👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
You can tell Mat doesn't fake his happiness. He doesn't do it for the camera, he is just truly happy the car started. In todays world of fake YouTube videos and reactions this is priceless to see, such an honest and real person.
Loved this, I was willing the Lambo engine to start for the first time in 7yrs. Almost like it was trying to bring itself back to life.  Can't wait for the next one, Matt, love your work and your team.
Amazing that was so exciting really enjoyed that my name is Alpay and I'm following from Turkey can't wait for the next episode 👍🏼
Epic
Ohhh finally!!!
Wish my dad was still alive so we can build stuff together😢
This is probably your most exiting build
Amazing work to the A Team - tears of joy. Smiles all round.👍🏻
Probably ended up resorting to the same tactics as the guy who rebuilt it previously.  Mint to see it fire up finally 👌
Well done Mat! 👍👌😎
It's Alive,It's Alive...!!!! Well done Matt & Team massive effort CONGRATULATIONS 👍👍👍👍👍
Your man on top of his game and you are honestly such an inspiration and your dad is an absolute legend 🙌

Very happy for you matt mate
It was a great fight to rebuilt this engine and makes it running. MAT , you and all your friends are Super Mechanics . I will be very happy when you will only have to choose the color of the NEW MURCIELAGO. Thank you MAT for this video.
I mean if Ricky and Freddy were there then it was gonna go ffffiiinnnneeee hah
From the 1st start engine, now i can see how it related to the Tractor. Salute to the Lamborghini founder!
I love how sketchy this build is
That felt great. I was cheering with you Mat good job dude you and your dad kicked ass. PS I love your story. It’s great one love your videos all the way from Arizona USA.

So happy for you. Awesome accomplishment.
Great team effort fantastic to hear it run 👏👏👍

Congratulations Mat! Great achievement 🎉
Had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation, genuine goose bump moment, cant wait for the next video, top work Mat by you and your dad
Lee is lucky guy 😃
Ahh well done Mat!
I genuinely went onto your channel today thinking 'Is that bloody car sorted yet and have I missed the video' Then tonight first thing on my wall. Happy days, Cant wait to see it finished 😁
Great ethos, if in doubt then brute force and ignorance usually does the trick - if not then get s bigger hammer!
If a TV commissioner doesn't snap Matt and Co for a series, I'll eat my pants.
Man! You Rock! 😎🤘 Because of your videos like that, I will start my own project car.
Love your videos Matt, I’ve seen the yellow Cayman a few times on the M42 as I drive home but it hasn’t been you driving when I stick my thumb up 🙏🏻
Never underestimate the ingenuity of a British man in his shed. Love it.
Your old man is always smiling what a great bloke to have around you Matt, loved it👍👍👍
Americans love their v8s but just w8 until u get that bad boy singing
Akekho osebenzisa uCapitec la angisize
🥳🥳yes dude 👊
Well done Mat, what an achievement, roll on the next episode. 👍👍👍👍👍👍
Best uk car channel going 🎉absolutely smashing it Mat 🙏
Well done guys im well chuffed for you...alot of work but sure worth it 👌 💜😄
I have the most massive silly grin on my face after that, so happy for you all.
Your dad is such an awesome guy 🎉
Please finish this in Lamborghini white.
Ummm I think this might be my favourite automotive channel  Only been watching since this lambo build  But have caught up on the other builds
Oil leak issue are common when rebuilding an engine.. For my Citroën 2CV I had to disassembled the engine 2 times as well because of 1st oil leak, then, cylinder issue.. It's really raging but what a satisfaction when it goes well in the end
Amazing job, well done, Mat! Keep my fingers crossed🤞
Your enthusiasm is infectious, even when stuff doesn't go to plan 😊
You and your dad are definitely the original engine whisperers
Like most rebuilds they're a bit lumpy on the first start but once it cleared its throat of all that excess fuel and oil in the combustion chambers it sounded sweet! Really enjoyed that vid Mat. Also would love to see your dad's reaction from behind the wheel when its fully sorted.
O my god ,am so happy for you ,it put a smile 😅on my face after all theses months of watching, well done mat ,and your dad to 👌
Dope YouTube channel bro. Really enjoy your content. Barely watch full videos. But your videos are full of good vibes and enthusiasm. Keep it going and try get more videos out
Amazing moment and Tavarish was there as well 👍🏽
LOVE TO SEE IT 🎉 can’t wait to see the rest of the exhaust fitted, been a pleasure 👌🏼
What legends 🖤🔥
Awesome, love the lamborghini building videos. Cant wait to see u finish the car (and all the problems with that). Succes from the netherlands
Man, just loved the sheer happiness in everyone's eyes. Congratulations and thanks for letting us be a part of this journey!!
One more question. Did you put the ignition wires to the correct spark plugs?
Epic, just epic! Fair play!
Car ver-e-call 😂❤🎉
porsche 992 update?
Legend
Was great to see Freddy there mabye some parts smuggling for the maclaren?😊
This monster is shooting flames and yet its far from complete
Excellent, worth all the hard work
EPIC! the joy on your dad's face when it started ahaha loved it
I am in awe of you and your dad. In a future (sad) world of EV's, seeing that V12 burst into life was truly special! The internal combustion engine is a spectacular thing! Congratualtions Mat
I've been looking forward to hearing that sound for ages....  Well done!!!
I know this is a very random idea, and it might be one for your 2nd channel, but I'd love a walkthrough of your unit and a breakdown of all the tools you use. I.e ones you use on  a daily basis like brand etc etc. I personally think it would make a great video. What are your thoughts?
So  fun to watch .Looing forward to see it running okay . Hope you can figure it out . And btw  that song in the end of the  video . I get stuck in my head . What band or singer? Tried all sorts of lyrics but can't find it .
Think just to get the engine running again is an achievement considering the state it was in.
Its always better to do it right even if it takes longer....
Love it can’t wait to see this fully sorted
Well done Mat and team. I love your dad.Your laugh is contagious.
Sensational 🎉🎉🎉 no other comment needed 🏎💥
Matt, so so so many smiles and laughs. Keep being you brother.
I'd be filling it with oil and spinning the engine over on the starter while he engine is on the floor before installing it.  EDIT: I see that's what you did!
I have been waiting for a long time to see the Murcielago start. Dayum you had put a lot of work hats off 💝
Well pleased for you all after the hard work you've put into it 😎👍👍
Excellent!!! Save the Murciélago!
You really used the lidl o-ring set on a lamborghini😂👍
Truly epic when it fired up wow
This was such a beautiful moment. It was amazing. Many many congratulations to you Mat
Goddammit, it's just a car starting, but for some reason it's so emotional. Great job!
Amazing stuff
great video, coming from a liverpool fan 😊
This build is absolutely f****ng epic! I absolutely love an MA video. I've watched many YouTubers rebuilding cars and slowly lost interest in the channel but there's just something about this channel that has kept me along for the ride ever since the first BMW on the drive! This guy is now rightfully living his best life and 100% deserves it. Keep up the amazing content mate, I'm here for the long run👍
Ahhh Mat congratulations 🎉
Wuauu..fantastic..i love this first sound 🙏
Now that was an emotional rollercoaster 🎉
Hey Matt just wanna say what an Inspiration you’ve been to me I quit my job in December same time you bought the Lambo and haven’t missed a video since, keep up the killah job can’t wait to see the BMW, Porsche and Lamborghini completed and on the road all the best from Perth Western Australian 🤩😃
I think we should all chip in and buy that girl a new pair of jeans..
Brill mate need more videos 👍
Man you need to give us daily videos. I call this an Addiction😅
The fact your enjoying all this so much makes it even more watchable. Cannot wait for the conclusion of the restoration, it’s going to be mega.
Waited for this great work Matt keep it up
Great stuff!! We need the next update asap!!
I come here for smiles and laughter ❤
Yeah 🎉🎉😊
Awesome work guys!
No Mat Armstrong Yfood edition plug. Unsubscribed 😜 Jokes aside this build has been wild. Heart was in my throat watching if it would turn over. So happy for you Mat that you got it running.
Epic!! 🎉
If you could have seen the size of my grin when that monster finally started! Now THAT right there is a feel good moment :D
Insane journey!!!
Congrats from the USA
congratz man :D
Yes ! ,,I have been looking forward to this so much . Amazing that it ran .
Mat, did you know that dealerships are tolt to tell you thst you aren't able to do a job because they want to do it themselves to bring in more revenue. They most assuredly don't want you to prove them wrong. I'm so glad you were able to put that lower cover at the front of that engine. Congratulations on a successful installation of that cover.
Thank you god,  for Mat and his videos :)
Tavarish indeed! Such a humble guy.
I was genuinely excited to see this start
I never thought of the pressure of being in Lee’s shoes 😂
V12 is alive, what a milestone! Love the build, keep the momentum Mat!!
Epic!!! I was that chuffed to hear that first rev you’d think it was my own car!
Congratulations on getting that started! Not even a Lambo tech would attempt to start on that. Love it, man!
How f'en cool is that  ...
oh wow what a roller coaster ...love it
What an amazing community this is! Mat and his dad resurrecting the engine, other guys at workshop helping out, Tavarish just checking in to help as well. Then the php guy giving online advice, and Lee starting the car eventually!
Well done Matt and the team, Fantastic stuff.
Well done for working out the jigsaw. That's the part that I'm most impressed with. Rebuilding most of the car when you didn't strip it is very hard. Super super sketchy with the oil seals. I think in time they will leak. They need to be compressed via the head via the head bolts. But hey what do I know. Waiting for the finished car.... Don't wrap it please please.. 😁
Was at edge of seat ...egging it on. Come on!! Shes ALIVE!!!!
I felt the tension while watching, great job!!
That laugh man, it’s infectious 😂
Brilliant video, they just keep getting better and better. Making lovely memories with your dad being on the journey with you… best yet and there has been a lot of great videos….keep it up Matt❤❤
Congrats, the world is watching and cheering for you - best content on the interweb for the moment!
wow what a sound!!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
aircraft sealant is the best you can get it’s the dogs 🐕 ⚽️ and it’s cheap enough 🤙🏻
It’s going to feel so amazing driving this knowing you rebuilt it yourself.
Love Freddy popping in 👍🏻
Well done Mat what a job
Owe noe
Another way you could have done the timing cover was to take all of the studs out, slide the cover up into place, and replaced them either all with bolts or put them in afterwards if there was a dire need for studs.
Awesome matt, dad and all, what a journey so far!!!👍😊🥳🎉
Fantastic
When does the next gt3 video get released? I cant wait to see it!!
First time I saw you dad I thought "Wow this guy seem pretty calm and serious. How could he raise that open--souled son". Then I saw how he laughs and things turned back in place xD
Amazing mat
Yeah beat it on with a hammer.😅😅 Let's see how long that lasts😂
If I start a YouTube channel for cars does that mean Freddie will come over to help me with projects? He seems like he’s involved in every petrol heads projects on YouTube regardless of what continent you’re on 😂. He’s a legend!
😊
Wow Mat! This is amazing! The chemistry between you and your dad is lovely. Keep up the good work! We love it 🎉
Something appears to me while looking to your videos,,,, The world can be changed if you have a good will and an stupidly (at first sight) immoderate optimism... Thank you so much mister Armstrong you make me still believe in human  nature, and it's a not so common in the rough times we're all facing now!
Brilliantly mate welldone
If the issue does not resolve cant you machine the surfaces to get it flat?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥The more flame the better🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When it fired up I was clapping in sync like everyone in the video. This is pretty awesome, much love 😎
Now that BBC has cancelled Top Gear, does anyone else think Matt & Freddie would make excellent presenters?
It will be a miracle if this engine doesn’t grenade itself 😂
Shoutout to your dad. He seems like  a deadset legend.
Wow this video was absolutely unreal! Honestly felt like i've been there through the whole journey and when she started up for the first time i couldn't stop smiling! What a journey this has been and i've loved every single episode of the Murci and it's incredible that you've managed to do all this and get it to where it is now! Lee must have been over the moon to crank her over and get that first start, wicked video as always bro!
this is like some sort of apocalypse episode at the end.... we found this lambo buried in the sand and if we can get it going maybe we can survive the journey across the wasteland....
excellent!
Mwaaa that crank case assembly was sketchy as F ☠️ Hopefully no problems accur further as to This
❤Amazing. It came alive like Frankenstein.😂
tavarish is right...
dang after 7 years the car finally came back to life well done Mat well done
What a adventure 🎉🎉 had goosebumps when it first fired up 😂  you deserve it all mat . Greetings from the netherlands 😁👍
I've been waiting!  Congrats,  Mat!
The😀 long awaited journey has begun
I would love to paint the car for ya
Well done mate you should be so proud of what youve achieved with the car
Awesome 🎉
Your dad looks like he has a blast working on this car with you his excitement is so contagious
Banger video 😊
Rebuild your dad's dream car ❤
Star of the video was Matt’s dad. I smiled seeing him so happy they got the motor casing on.
Mat, you and your Dad are Legends!!!
That was raw! Fk me but when the engine took, it sounded on point , beautiful!  Matt’s Dad is a legend to have guided him all the way to this point. Yooo
yes yes bro
It’s all impossible. How any of this works is beyond me. Sketchy is one thing- all of this is chance divided by luck. Extraordinary stuff.
Brilliant. Totally bonkers, but brilliant. We'll done.
Good stuff Mat. Salute to your dad for being by your side entire build.
Your dads class man 😂
Sitting on the edge of my seat, just hoping it starts!!
This is by far your best episode so far. I really shared your happiness and was clapping my hands when the beast started for the first time in 7 years. I can`t wait for it to be on the road again. Keep pushing on!!
His dad loves doing this with him, so good to watch
Wait what's Freddy doing there
Mat, Ricky, Freddie and Dad. Absolute dream team!
Absolutely brilliant matt. I’m sitting here with a massive smile on my face. So pleased it started. Glad to be part of this journey with you. Keep the positivity flowing buddy!!
Go you good thing! What a series ❤
Well done Matt 👏
Brilliant, just brilliant ! In Italy with work, desperately waiting to see this upload. Sitting here on the edge of my seat like I was involved with the build! So chuffed for you bud !
@matarmstrong what is the smoke coming from the back of the motor when your dad and you are looking at the oil leak?
I am happy to see someone who is so happy about a car😊
Should have just done it the right way the first time instead of dicking around.
Unbelievable man keep up the good work can’t wait for the next video 👍
So much joy watching all of you tackle this project and others! Truly inspiring you are. 👏🏾
I'm smiling watching these videos......actually makes a change :)
Well done Matt.
Brilliant...😂
I was smiling for the last few minutes of that 😂🎉
Your dad is amazing 😊! Thank you Lee for being available, I wouldn't know what I would do if I had to wait for another video 😅.
The look on Mat’s face says it all.. dreams really can come true lol loving following this build mate keep up the quality content 👏🏻 im only “down the road” right by wheel mania so who knows might even see you about in it one day
Worth the wait . Well done 👏
This brought tears to my eyes.. well done for all the effort you have put into this project. You and your dad, really give me the motivation to restore my car, BMW 8 V12.. watch this space. Thanks again.  😊
I'd just put in a 2jzgte and have a much more enjoyable car and still keep the cool
Choked to life!!!!! HORAY!
Hearing that engine come to life is amazing!
Amazing job have you done guys! I love your videos Matt🥂
everytime i looke up one of your videos , you make me smile . keep at it .
Congratulations, what an episode 🤘
@13.42 sorry my bad 😶
Well done Lads, massive effort payed off in the end.
Oh man that piano piece playing in the background around 12:00 is beautiful. Any chance anyone knows where I could find it?
wow🤯
If this isn’t the best channel on YouTube I want to know what is! Awesome work guys. Love this ❤
Legend bro
This video was brought to you by the word “sketchy”.

Like this is my car 😂 I’m thrilled to be the car started
Congratulations 😍
Love the videos … but car vertical is wank mileage discrepancies showing mileage lower than previous year mot but showing as a green tick on report… verticals response that it’s not over the threshold 😂😂😂😂 any mileage lower than previous year is a discrepancy no ? Jokers

AMAZING)))))
I've waited 6 months for this!!!! This is astonishing. The car industry has a new legend...Matt and his old man!
Congrats on getting it started.
definitely sketchy, I'd be surprised if one of those seals hasn't broken
Brilliant!  Disappointment and then joy!  Class to let a comp winner turn it over too!  Top job!
I love this show!!!

That was absolutely gripping! Must’ve been an amazing feeling 👌👌👌
i would have removed all the studs as well. make it way easier
What a milestone...amazing effort to get the engine to where you are now!!
Oh man, what a journey! That was fantastic. I was almost too scared to watch when Lee did the first turn and the car started spitting flames - flipping brilliant! This channel gets better and better with every video. Love it
Done well mucker she runs
Love your videos 😊 look forward to them
Tyler, Ed and Freddy have Murci's and now so do you. Maybe you can join a future CarTrek series about Murcielagos?
Well done fella 👍, keep pushing on matt 👏
Well done mat and your dad and all the team you conquered it brilliant video 😊
Matt... your laughing is infectious.... Great videos.......👍
Congrats man I love your risk taking and enthusiasm, I’m sure you and your Dad are super proud of this one. Well done!!!
I'm enjoying this series a little too much! Can't wait for the next episode ❤❤
Things like this are something to consider when getting into doing your own work on engines. Thank you for sharing so we can see how lambo builds their engines, the issues we'll run into on our own (when we can buy one lol)
Such a project requires a very of positive mindset which you thankfully have.
"Its alive, its alive!!!" says Dr Frankenstein. Woo-hoo, thank goodness for the sound of a v12 mill!!!!!
Superb stuff well done 👍🏻
Fantastic mate, best channel on YouTube!
Love this buzzing, ps I was the person that got you to hold the purple bird on Saturday 😂
Legend mate. Fair play to you
ICONIC MOMENT!
good shit boss
Hell yeah Mat! That engine blast was very gratifying!! Can't wait for the next video of the series!!
That sound!
Mat I love your Aussie sort of attitude where we say “well we’ll just give it a go”. That’s why I really enjoy watching all of your video’s. Don’t ever stop just giving it a go Mate.  Cheers from Australia 🇦🇺.
wow it's been a long journey😀😀😀I'm glad that it finally started ....keep up the good work mate🤘🏼🇿🇦🇿🇦Keep on saving the manuals
Wow....I feel like this is my car watching the transformation over this time.....as has been said everyone needs a "Mat's Dad" ....what a star ⭐ That V12 when running sounds awesome......Enzo Ferrari must have cursed when he first saw and heard that ROAR ... Really chuffed for you and your team to get closer to that inaugural road test which I hope and pray there's no smoke, oil or steam and just SMILES 😁😁. Be happy , be safe 🙏🙏 Gary 🦉🦉🦉
Me and my dad used to argue like F**k whilst tinkering with motors,I should have done everything his way instead of arguing as he was usually right,love the content Matt
it was so crazy to see but it started so important❤
I follow your builds religiously and I think I’m just as happy the lambo started as you are man!!🎉 keep living your dreams Matt.  All the way from South Africa here
I've waited months to hear that engine and it didn't disappoint!
Hopefully your rtv doesn’t get sucked into those oil passages
What a moment! So glad it started!!! You’ve sparked a passion of care for me I didn’t know I had.
Love watching your videos Matt. You've inspired me to change my career and become a trainee mechanic at the age of 31. Hats off to you 🙂
Awesome!
Looks fun
Hey Matt, next time you rebuild something crazy and you think....Yayyy!!!...And want to run over and Hug your Dad...Sod the Cameras and everyone else...Run over and hug him...;D
When the engine started I felt a joy I havent felt in a long time.
Freddie is a legend!
Absolute legend, I got emotional when she finally coughed into life!!
I love the spirit of not giving up! Very well done!
Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang turned into a fire-breathing dragon. Well done all of you. Compulsive viewing.
Would have been  a great time to ditch the crappy exhaust manifolds and cats for a nice catless header system!
Brilliant video, great work guys 👏
Epic...just epic ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fuck yes!!! This had me smiling and replaying over and over again! Great work! Excited for the next vid!
Well done Mat and team
Dude ur dad is AMAZING!
Think I’ll let Ian Tyrrell rebuild my Lamborghini 🥴
You and your Dad are classics! Your excitement and laughter is contagious! Thanks for always making great content! 🙂
AYYY PERFECT! It runs a bit!. Couldnt wait for it!!! So glad to see you happy and that car running at PT10 of this series. Huge congratulations man!
Man I felt for you with those oil seals... we've all done something like that before!. Fantastic to see it fire up after 7 years, great work.
I never get notifications for your videos. I have to keep checking. 💩
Brilliant!  Fantastic teamwork, tenacity, ingenuity, enthusiasm and good humour!     Good luck with the next phase!!!
Epic fun. What did you do to sort the cluster in the end?
hi matt, i really appreciated the work you did to save the cars but in this video i feel like i have to tell you that it is not by looking for shortcuts that you solve problems.  certain jobs must be done well following a logic, otherwise you'll just waste time in useless attempts.  however the fact that you can find spare parts at a lower price than the manufacturer is a good thing
When the guys that come to turn the key are wearing Ultima hoodies you know they're car guys!
Wow
I was at Petrolheadonism underground at the weekend. You editing the video whilst also doing all the stuff there. Holy shit man your work ethic is through the roof.
As a dad I can see the pride, admiration and sheer pleasure your dad gets from this.....just makes it that much better too watch. ✌️
Just sat at the side of the road watching this in my truck 🚚, shouting come on Murcielago!! Well done, loved the video.
Wonderful job mate. So happy for you!
That's how you end a video with smoke everywhere
👍🇬🇧🇺🇦
What an amazing video! Team effort and great to see you get it right and get that beast going again! Love it!
What drugs were you smoking when you bought this car?? Lol 😂 I’m sure you remember that line when I spoke to you at Petrolheadonism. Would have been better if my brother would have looked for the photo 🤣 Honestly such a pleasure to meet and chat with you.   Joking aside what a journey you have been on with this car!! The hurdles that you have over come has been unbelievable!!! I have watched your channel for so long now watching it go from strength to strength, all the hard work that you put in is really paying off !!! You really deserve all the success you get 👍
Yeah man !! 🙌🏻👏😎 Nicke work🇸🇪
Murcies don't have much oil pressure at low RPM
Never smiled so much watching an engine come to life almost brought a tear to me ..... absolutely amazing so pleased for you cannot imagine the joy it has bought you after the the hard work AMAZING
How euphoric was that start! Awesome job Matt and dad
Love you guys ----- Finaly :)
That start was magical, well done, great work!
Congratulations awesome 👏
Feel sorry for all the people who bought some merch had no chance to win when the person picked had to be relatively nearby to start it 😬 great vids but…
I'm smiling ear to ear!!
JUST AMAZING WORK FROM YOU AND YOUR DAD. DESERVE EVERYTHING
Beast is alive!!!❤😅
Haha. Awesome.
Superb!!! Congrats to you and the whole team and for Lee 🎉
I was so willing the old girl to start and fire back to life. Well done Matt and everyone who helped now your're finally on your way :D
WOW amazing
Nine one🎉
Am I the only one that had to hold tears back in?
That’s the perfect team Matt. Father and son. Amazing work and talent as always. Can’t wait to see the    Finished project 👍
Ah that one put a smile on my face
YES MAT!!! GET IN! This has literally made my night! Well done both of you. Hard work has paid off mate!
So nice seeing Freddy in the UK
You should phone Ian Tyrell to get it set up…
It's a great feeling when you've had the engine in bits and it actually starts. Well done all of you, great job. 👏
This build is so addictive and inspiring ❤️
This channel is like a drug!! This episode got me wanting more and more! Now i want to see the next one. Brilliant!!
Yes lad👍🏻
That really didn't sound happy 😂
Nothing like the first start on an engine you’ve got blood sweat and tears in 💪🏼
lets gooooo!!!!
:o)❤
Congrats G⚡️⚡️
FINALLY IT STARTED AND CAREFUL NEXT TIME WITH THE JUMPER CABLE
Tavarish legendary comrade
Straight outta Leicester! Love it man! Good work guys!❤❤
finaly yesssssssss
Wow.  I think it’s your best upload to date, the involvement with your dad is the best.  I’ve recently lost my dad, but just the same as you two. Both petrolheads, loved anything with an engine and constantly tinkering. Times like this are priceless, he’s a legend.   Please include him as much as possible, as unreal as the Porsche build is… this video was very emotional to watch for me. What an achievement, your well and truly living the dream Mat 😎
All the way from south africa the smiles i had for this lovely stuff me armstrong Legends
I can almost feel ed bolian licking his lips at the thought of this murci
welldone mate all that hard work uve put into it love it keep it up Matt
DDE with the yellow gated merci, Tavarish with the Orange F&F gated merci and Mat with the Green merci.. truly epic builds!
Absolutely buzzing for you mate!! Nice work!! ❤
The    Mat Mobile runs Wow     Dinner Dinner Dinner         Mat Man  Nice one chap 👍
Please rebuild your Dads dream car!!!!!
Funny as f**k 😂🤣🤣🤣🎉
This is fantastic Matt, your energy and enthusiasm is incredible. I was so excited for the car to start, onward and upwards! 💥💪🏻
Mate just take the heads off and do it properly, don’t understand how people can work like that
You are the best
Top man!.. Talk about edge of my seat !!
Brilliant 👍🏻👍🏻
Been crazy watching this car journey haha!!   That feeling and happiness getting that engine started must be a unreal feeling great achievement 🙂👌🏼
Legends my g
I can honestly say I have never felt so much joy from watching a video I was genuinely celebrating when it fired up thank you
Legends all of you, I had butterflies waiting in anticipation for it to start. Matt you are an inspiration to many, keep up the good work. Can't wait another week for the next video update 👍
Finally the beast roars!!!! Can't beat an angry V12 ✅
well done bro, I have been watching from the first vid on the MURCIELAGO, and watching this vid made me so happy. I can wait for it to be on the road all painted up with that sick exhauste.
Absolutely brilliant video's Mat, please keep making them
timing needs to be adjusted.
that was well cool just need to see her on the road buddy
YESSSSS
Wahoo from San Diego. I’ve been watching the Lambo videos with fingers crossed since you bought the car.
so the mileage question.....if you've rebuilt the engine... it's got zero miles, surely?
Great video matt nice to see the old girl finally running 😅
❤love it brother
Surprise cameo by Freddie! Love it!!
Coolbeens. Expensive shed
FAR OUT MAT!!!
Well done lads 👍👍
Very emotional watching this, you did it Matt/Lee 👏 😂🎉
🔥🔥⚡🔥 💨
Fantastic. Big smiles.
super cool video !  thx for sharing all those good vibes :)
Hahahahaha, was going to make the shim steel comment, then I got to the part where Sonny told you to do it.
🎉👍🏻
The best video on YouTube this year! The joy when she started! Can’t wait to see this project completed but hang on then there’s the GT3 oh and the M5……. Just killing it Matt, keep up the great work 👊👊👊
Mate that was emotional. I hope you gave your dad one hell of a hug
From portugal, big hug. I love your genuineness
letssgooooo 🔥🔥🔥🔥 cannot imagine how dope is the feeling being in your shoes! Much respect!
Brilliant matt hope to see this on the road soon🙏🙏👏👏👏👏👏
i literally clapped at 21:39 ith all you and got goosebumps its so satisfying to see it start...clapped real hard....great job
Everybody needs a mate like tavarish
Feeler gauge works and is easier to get.
Brilliant
Congratulations Mat! Now just sort the rest quick and have a proper go!
Matt needs to watch Project Binky - you have about another 5 years to go before you finally finish it 😂
Slightly emotional 😄
I’ve never been into cars or anything like that but I genuinely can’t wait to watch a new video every time you post. The way you explain technical things about the cars so that even I can understand them is unbelievable. I refreshed YouTube about 100 times waiting for this video.   Thank you for the content, you deserve all the success.
Between this build and Freddies storm damaged McLaren they are the 2 most epic super car rebuilds on YouTube!
This is unreal I was on the edge of my seat! So happy for you and your dad, what a labour of love 🔥
Matt u r an insane crazy bugger and i am so happy for u that it finally worked out to get the  engine running. Top work. 😂
Well Done
Hearing you guys laugh no matter what makes me happy
Congrats, it’s been a ride thru rough seas been watching since day one of the build and this shows that nothing is impossible, you built a car without being a Lamborghini technician! And without a lot of information, now is time for stage 2.
What a great fun episode, it’s huffed and puffed into life and sounds amazing, I’m looking forward to more 👍
Finally!!! Love youuu❤
u got air?
Fantastic!!
Mat, your fans are the best!  :)
Fantastic
Bro is just rebuilding epic cars and laughing like a maniac while he does it LOL I absolutely love it. Keep up the great work, man!
Crazy that this car is in my city, I missed it when you was in town and I’m probably never going to see it
Ahh well done mate, was praying it starts, felt like I’m starting my own car.
I'm smiling like mad watching that turn over, congrats and can't wait to see more!!!
WHat an absolutely amazing video. That was so captivating to watch! Adding onto the fact that I don't think I've been been has hooked to a YouTube project at this! Keep up the awesome content Mat.
He came to visit in europe. Cool
Coming from the US there needs to be more people in this world like Matt and his dad this video brought tears to my eyes it's amazing. It's awesome to see the love that they spread to everyone that they meet!
Brilliant, brilliant brilliant well done to you and your dad ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏😂😂😂🍺
This has got to be Thee best channel on YouTube. Congratulations for all your hard work Mat and the team 👏  I genuinely look forward to your videos
Fucking brilliant video....yeah...the sound belt thing is right..this is how you do the belts on my Ducati...definitely an inspiration you are sir....I'm a biker and happy working on bikes...since following you I've changed the clutch on our little iq, rear dampers, front shock, just about to do a double din conversion on it...wouldn't have attempted it otherwise
Mat, you and Tavarish freaken beasts!!!
You should give the Winner have a test drive. The actual start was a bit technical not a dramatic and compelling memory.
Amazing. Perseverance pays off, Well done 👍
The best videos I've ever watched ❤
Reckon Freddie could get you on one of his programmes that a rip off of top gear, I mean homage
It may have been sketchy sorting out the oil leak but that was epic finally getting that engine started. Can't wait to see it fully sorted now it's going to look, and sound, amazing.
Totally felt that joy!
At the end there it looks like timing is off.
What site do you use for your workshop manuals also the site or program you use showing the breakdown and cost of each part.
Would have had a fire extinguisher to hand 😅
If I had to take a wild guess I bet the fuel system is full of old nasty fuel and if it was all flushed it would run great.
Yes finally can't wait to see this car run🔥😍
hope it all holds up when oil upto temperature and pressure🤞🤞
When all else fails, RTFM! “Save the manual” 😂
Sat here on my couch cheering with you all like a lemon haha! not many YouTube channels make me sit here smiling from ear to ear!
She’s alive 👍👍👍
Amazing Matt!!
loved meeting you at the Petrolheadonism event yesterday
greatest mechanic of all time
unbelievable yall did that, it's amazing!!!
Lets goo!!!
Awesome Mat!
I should of waited lol
mate, this is the best video ever!
Matt.. I would just like to say god bless you always and you are lucky to have the kind of friends you have and a father like that.. That in itself is a bit thing. Always cherish them. Trust me. Loneliness is a Dark Place.
Been waiting to hear it burst into life , well done guys
What a sense of achievement to hear it fire up! Great work Matt and team 💪🏻👍🏻🇬🇧
Every time when I watch Mat videos I never skip a second during the video , duno why , but his videos are so well done ! Good job mate 👏👏🎉🎉
Your Dad is loving this mate and it clearly means a lot to him! Hope to do something like this with my sons one day!
Congratulations ! huge work keep going thanks
That roaring sound put a smile on my face 😁 One of the coolest project I seen
I don't get why it would be so hard to start at first, if the valve timings etc were correct.
Wow, what an amazing effort and wonderful bonding time with your dad to get the Lambo back to life. You are a true inspiration and I can’t wait for the next episode of any of your builds. Nice one Mat 👍🇬🇧
Easily becoming one of my favorite channels. Your true expression and love for what you do makes the videos so great
Brilliant great to hear it run  well done to all your crew
I know they say Italian v12 engines are like a fine instrument, but that took the meaning of “tuning a car” to a whole new level!
Fantastic watch.... love it😊
Congrats dude - I could see you counting the cylinders popping - fair play
Congratulations……loved seeing Hannah and Kevin. Adventures with your Dad are fun to see and will be treasures later in life!
Awsome
Ah man looked like your dad was going to give you a high five or hug when it had started and you turned sound 😅😅 poor git
Yes Matt you legend!!!
I was on edge just watching this! The emotional music didn’t help haha!  Can’t wait to see it up and running and find out what you will do to the body work! Would be great for Lee to come back and drive it when it’s all complete!  Another great video!!
Holy effing everything! Thats ace!! What a ledge. Putting a v12 engine together from scratch. basically from a bodged previous attempt to it firing up and working. Class. Youre dad is ace too helping you. What an achievement gents!! It Sounds sweet too with no exhaust. Oldskool v12 baby!!🎶🎵❤️❤️
Matt that’s awesome and your dads enthusiasm is a joy to behold ( & he’s also rocking the same hairstyle as me!!!) 👍😂

It’s 4am in the morning  here in Western Australia…. “Go back to sleep…. Oh! Oh! Mat’s got a new MurcieLago  video! Heeeeell no! I’m watching this!”  Wow, that brief running sound  like you have summoned the long lost spirit of a fighting bull! Got chills! Much respect to the whole gang!!🤗✊🤘

Sharing your joy and passion with others is why I think people take to you.  Your dad is AMAZING!!! Please don't ever change, stay grounded and humble as you are. Bet Ricky had a heart attack at the seal method, your car your rules!

I thought you was going to give somebody the chance to start the car the first time
Well done that man...!
Phrases I uttered watching that V12 turn over;  I am not an expert but should it be doing that?  And  I would not be standing near that…  😂  But fair do’s, it’s going!
😁
Me watching this @1:30am. Finally the beast started. I can peacefully go to sleep now ❤.

This is so awesome! So glad you got it started!
The one thing I think is not discussed is how you could ever be sure the 2 o-rings stayed in place correctly, even if no leaks doesn't mean they are right.
What a epic video mate. Your dad is a legend 👍🏻💙
Amazing work love the content can’t stop watching
I've watched you since forever, but I think when that started, that is the happiest I have ever seen you. Well done mate.
Yassss
Dude!! Tavarish in the UK with YOU!!! That's mega and I smell something new brewing.😀😀
Oh Mattt Mannnn that start up of the Lambo brought a massive smile to my face like a Cheshire Cat!!!!! You and your dad are amazing!!!!!! Thanks
Wish you'd have painted that engine babe it's not looking good
The joy after starting the macelogo is amzing🎉🎉🎉😅 Really enjoyed the vid
Good job you deserve it and please can we get a video on you driving it
The maniacal laughing when it started at the end was worth the watch. What an accomplishment 😊🎉
Literally held my breath until the beast came to life, what a journey 😎
Congrats for getting the beast going again :D
Great work mate! What oil pressure did it get when it was running?
So happy for you !
Matt is a living legend man
Great stuff, so pleased for you when it finally fired up. Been my favourite project you have done so far. Can’t wait to see it get the bodywork sorted out.
I’ve never been so excited to hear an engine turn over! Great job Mat.
You underestimate your abilities.  Kudos to you all, amazing work ( the music gave it away that it was going to start 😂)
Brilliant , great vid
there's a saying in clock repair: the harder a clock is to work on, the more times you'll have to disassemble and reassemble it to get it right.  8-)     i applaud your patience throughout, particularly when hitting bumps in the road.
Well done Matt! Good to see you Saturday! Congratulations getting the old girl running! Your dad is an absolute ledge.
What a rush! I love it! Great work
Best rebuild ever. Massive job!
Big smile on my face watching this well done matt and good stuff lee 😂
Parabéns pela tua dedicação , vejo todos os teus vídeo desde Portugal 🇵🇹 …
Been following your journey from your drive way.amazing content and a pleasure to watch keep up the great work Matt
You just made my day..Thank you Mat. One thing I mainly like about you is that you keep your smile no matter what worst situation comes up❤
You and your dad plus all your help, even Freddy and DDE are F'ing Legends! I was smiling so hard my cheeks hurt, lol.
My supercharger belt I tightened using the Gates belt app for bicycles and my iPhone. It worked perfectly.
Cried
After all that fucking about it would have been quicker to just do it properly the first time, I'd have definitely done the same thing as you though 😂😂
Can't wait to see the Murcielago fully sorted.  It should be epic.
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Well Done!
Well done lads am buzzing for yous keep it up
Fantastic content Matt - Team & Family, 10/10 . You should have your own main stream TV show. Love the channel.  Greetings from Ireland
Love the videos but please do it proper it’s so sketchy and will last better if you don’t cut corners surely?
Woooo congrats Mat🎉
Dude, this is so awesome. I teared up a little when it fired up! Fantastic work, Mat.
super work guys!!!!
NOT THE BIN!!!
Yes!! You rebuild a lambo engine with little to no manual on how to do it. Honestly buddy proper proud moment seeing it fire up was emotional mainly cause you had the chance to do this cool thing with your dad special!!! Times. Keep up the good work. Love your vids, can’t wait to see the GT3 finished. So hope you can get it to the UK to add it to the collection.
well done, can't wait for more
I haven't been this invested in a car in a long time. What a ride, and the work is worth it!
IT'S ALLLLIIIIIIIIIIIVEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
AWESOME
So happy you got it started, I was doubtful after your Facebook post. Been waiting for this video for weeks but it was definitely worth the wait. Well done to you, Hannah, your dad and everyone else who helped you with this build can’t wait for the next video. You need another build as Iv ran out of videos to watch 😂
How can I like more than once 😱🫶🏻
Engine bay looks like an ongoing barbecue ha ha. Good job on reviving this engine!
Pure pleasure
yessssss
i don't believe your dad didn't know the sheet metal trick, back as a apprentice in the 80s we did that with a lot of Jap cars
I dont know about the other subscrivers but i was laughing as hard as you when the engine started. Congratulations mate.
The joy on your face Matt when the Mean Machine started was... priceless. Fantastic episode...keep it up Matt!!
Anyone who didn’t say “YES” when she started just isn’t a petrolhead!! Well done guys! Chuffed for ya 👍👍🔥
I was on the edge of my seat watching this.  I've watched this rebuild from the start and loved every minute.  Well done to everyone, a lot of hard work but what a reward 👍👍
Amazin, so chuffed for you
⚠️⚠️⚠️ 2007 LAMBORGHINI GALLARDOS for sale on Copart only 45,000 miles mechanical fault ❓buy it

Is tavarish in the Uk?
Congratulations to you Matt, your dad and the team - so enjoying all your vids 😄
Out of every rebuild I’ve watched on here this one has been the hardest earned 10 parts just to hear that engine!
We love your videos Matt❤
Awesome watching this start after all of your hard work. Well done mate!
Outstanding video…. You deserve all the followers that you have!!
Hi Mat i so happy for you. You deserved it after a lot of work what you done on this engine. I was so happy when the Murcielago started 😊
Watching this brings back so many memories. Try Try Try and Try again. Persistency is key.
Class 😂😂😂😂 that was exciting
Haha. This is bloody amazing! So good to see that V12 fire up! Honestly never been so nervous…. Absolutely epic! You and your old man should be damn proud of what you’ve achieved! Inspiring stuff!
am all exciting lol
“Dont break the car Samir” 🤣
Omg, you and your dad are legends! I take my hat off for that. You must have had sweaty hands with the first attempt to start it.
I will say Matt along with your mechanical skills improving how you just pulled me into that sponsor ting god daaaaym
Amazing .
Goosebumps. Just goosebumps to see this project truly come to life. You deserve it Matt. 👏
Absolutely enjoyed it Mat! I’d press that subscribe button again and again 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Completely super crazy entertainment 😂
man im so invested! was so happy when it statred!!!
Your dads face 😂 well  done massive achievement
Well Done ---- Great
I was so chuffed for to hear it finally start well done
Dude I have been here since the beginning of the Lambo and thought you were insane for buying this and no way were you gonna even get the engine back in. And here you were able to get it running! Awesome job from the US Mat!
4 “suspect” throttle bodies and no communication issues with ign/fuel delivery? Hmm. I “think” mechanically motor might be ok. Maybe, possibly. But I bet there will be issues
Don't leave it too long for another upload😂
What a result, proper made up for you and your Dad. Not many would even dare to try and rebuild that engine from the state it was in and you's smashed it.
Crazy rebuild!! Lots of love to all of you 😍😍
Lee didn't look out of place in that garage at all! 😊
Really satisfying to watch this one man.
Woohoo
Epic content!
Seeing someone dressed like Mat is starting a Lamborghini Murciélago looks like a post-apocalyptic scene wherein a skater kid ransacks a rich guy's house and lives out his pipedream of driving a Lamborghini for the first time.
The fact that you shared this moment with a viewer is insane! What an absolute legend you are, this video almost brought up some tears for me! Keep working
Aww well done Matt, have been dying for this build to upload each video.. Great achievement to you and Dad and all evolved
The joy that a car brings to a man is incredible
That was absolutely quality!😂
Matt I was shouting go on go on too great vid
I’m truly happy for you mat… this feels like we’re part of the project as well. Can’t wait for the final results💯
I’ve been interested in cars for many years, but your videos have turned me into a car enthusiast. Matt, I love your energy and wish you all the best.
Every time I watch ur videos I get excited and motivated to start my own car projects.💯love ur videos mat❤💯. I'm watching u all the way from south africa 🌍, soweto💯
Been watching you silently all the way from Kenya but I had to comment today...This is awesome💯💯
Super video well done mate.........what a job😂😂😂😂😂....respect

No hate but jerry rigging a lambo engine??
Mat u are a legend, we watch you here in Spain. That murcielago is dope, I have a ton of respect for you and have fun with it!!
I literally shouted with you when it started, brilliant job mate 👍🏻
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 nice job, merci merci
And at that point, the whole world screamed in unison, FOOK YES!!!!!!!! 🎉
Epic content. Fantastic narration
So pleased it started, you and your dad truly deserve to enjoy the car for what you've achieved! Amazing!
Really enjoying this series. Really nice to see you working with your dad
you know what you should do matt, on the oil filler cap you should do your own billet aluminium with  your logo on to show that you have rebuilt the engine.
Mat, I am really happy that you did not give up on this project!  Yes, there have been numerous struggles along the way, but you pushed though and got it to work!  Congrats!
Do a car for your dad 🙏🏼
Someone buy Sara a pair of jeans 😁
Your so blessed to have a relationship with your Dad like this.
I said hello to you at petrolheadonism on Saturday 😁
The first attempts were an homage to Lamborghinis history ;)
I know its crazy how far this build has gotten but guys just try to comprehend matt and his dad rebuilt this entire engine from scratch alone and the fact that it actually runs is just amazing and deserves a round of applause
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A moment never to forget
Some dream not many do. Bring a tear to the eyes my friend...
Amazing job
Just me or did Mat leave his pops hanging? Man’s looked like he was going in for the hug 🤦🏻‍♂️ (21:45)
Congrats!
U and your dad absolute legends well done pal
Bro I’m struggling with a break up and depression with the last 2 years seeing you upload make me feel happy
I almost cried 😅
At last, I feel ive rebuilt the car, I was so nervous when it was getting cranked over, 👍👍👍 looking forward to its first drive
Please never stop collabing with Freddie, you two have the best energy together!
Fantastic, well done guys
Kudos, I "doth my cap" to you all!
Gave me the chills when it started 😮
So we all know you paid a bit too much for it, but hey, how many of us have never paid too much for a car we want?  Go on? you've got this with your Dad.
Make a chain
Not gonna lie, I stopped halfway through to go and watch Samir wrecking his car again.. 🤣
Congratulations🎉🎉🎉 Oh man! I have never been so glued to the screen before, so exciting! 👏👏
Here we gooooi
Mate these edits are inspirational. The tunes, the story telling. Insane. You had me jumping on the treadmill hoping it’ll start 😂

Hard work pays off i see, really nice work man! GZ!! 🎉🎉🎉

well done mate massive achievement to rebuild an engine like that 👍
😎Hell ya what awesomeness that was😎
What's up with the GT3 in America?
Wow Sara is very attractive! And I've heard of ripped jeans but that poor girl looks like she's been attacked by Edward Scissor hands!
🤪😂👍👊🍾👏👏👏
Always nice to be able to bring in the big gun Freddy 😂
Marvellous
amazing
Nice one matt, keep up the hard good work on YouTube. I think I need to drop my broken corsa off at your shop 😆. Bless up 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇯🇲
Looks like the Beast of Turin starting up with the flames & smoke!
The joy on his face  what a great feeling
Matt, honestly mate, one of my favourite bits about the series is the enjoyment your dad is getting out of this project, and seeing you two work together. I’m looking forward to when my son is older so we can do something like this
What a Beast!! Well Done Matt and Team! One of the best channels without a doubt! Great video again!
Amazing
Can I get the sound analyser app name?

Well done 👏
Mat are you not gonna go back to the US and finish the Porsche?
This is great. Well done Matt 🎉
Yeeeeeeeeesssssssssss 💥💥💥💥
That belt-tensioning procedure adds a whole new meaning to “tuning a car”.  155Hz is the E-flat below middle-C on a piano, or the first fret of the D string on a guitar 😂
Yes my word, how long did we wait for that to happen,
Mat you have come soo far I can’t wait to see this thing go to wheel mania and to look new and fresh and blast down streets ❤
*People who’ve never put an engine and trans in a car watching 13:19 “😮”  *car guys watching 13:19 “yup, don’t have to explain it to me 😅”
I can't believe it started, very excited to see where this car goes now
This is fun to watch. I can't help but thinking the smartest guy of all is that car experience bloke who can flog off all his broken cars to people like Mat and so on.
I would have cried so damn much. Good Job Mat 🤍
Wow 👍
Woaaahhh congratz guys! Yeez. That last minute smoke looked epic 🙃
Amazing Matt... Uauuuuu... Such a great even... One summit left... Nice video.. Nice moment... Best regards from Barcelona
I'm surprised!! Never in a million years i thought it would run! And it did!
Don't know why, gave me goosebumps when it started. So happy for you Matt
Hard work beats talent!!!
It looked like one of those videos where they’re cold starting a locomotive…..
you are amazing!! This is just incredible!! A big hug for everybody that work on that.....hahahahaha
Wicked just wicked Matt 👊👊👊👊👊👊
Your attitude is amazing. Most of the people, myself included would have just been super pissed and all red. But you, your dad, and your friends have the best attitude ever.

Sorry mate, but you know you still definitely overpaid for the car by a lot, and I mean a lot. But I love how you didn't take it's impossible to put on the casing without removing the heads for an answer. Your mate with the shim steel was spot on great advice 🎉

Legend 🤜🤛. Can't believe how excited I was when it started 😂
Your pops is a bit of a savage ! Unbelievable support from him .

Absolutely brilliant, well done😊
Awesome moment, the big engine ran.    Hopefully it runs strongly for years

Happy days, so happy for you all😂
Sounded like a tractor 😂
Made me cry when I saw how happy you got when it started🤩❤️🙏🏽 you are such a high spirited and happy guy, your videos are just awesome. This coming from a guy that never watched a rebuild video until that day I saw you had bought the green bull🤣🤩 thank you and bless you and please keep going.
That was awesome, glad to finally see (and hear it) running, what an amazing project!
Good job we have Freddie because we have had enough😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤🎉
my heart beat went like a roller coaster in this video hopefully it will be the same success in the gt3 asswell
So happy for you mat! Smiling ear to ear mate! Well done 🎉🎉
Hey mat it’s me again I’m wondering if u could do a crash damaged truck i doubt you would but like a fun day out then again you already have Range Rover but somethings you can put a scratch or two on and not mind maybe a Land Rover or a ford raptor
Why do I never get picked 😢
You are the king !!💪💪💪💪
Wow. That's the best post to date. Brilliant.
epic
You have got to do a mash up with DDE ! That would be epic !!  Love and respect from America 💪🏻👊🏻
The fact you don’t cut anything out of the videos. You could’ve just skipped over everyone of the oil leaks and none of us would’ve been the wiser. But you allowed everyone to see this, thank you for being so transparent.  Teamwork makes the dream work!!!
Tavarish, what is happening  with that Mclaren P1? :))) you are mad man!!😂
You better now sell this or give away this car Matt. This car has a sentimental value now
Good job 👏 👍 👌 🙌 😄 😀 👏
You did it.  Well done.  You're in hero territory. Absolute Lamborghini Legend you are Mat!

Ah so amazing. I couldn't help but smile with your reaction when you turned it over. So happy for you!
Love it...."oh man we did it wrong!"......"Don't worry we can do it wronger!" 😂 Exactly what most of us would have done.
@DDE IN THE BUILDING  !

That had me on the edge of my seat and smiling ear to ear....You've come so far mate. Cant wait to see her screaming down the road.
Brilliant 👍
Unreal work. We’ll done mat looking forward to the next
Just a suggestion, there’s a chip in your clocks which stores all the information such as mileage etc. just an off chance you may be able to get the mileage if you can get the info off the chip in the clocks
Congrats, what a journey..! 🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏

Bodge a bodge! Works... sometimes
I had a stupid grin on my face for the last part of the video, the kind you get when you’re genuinely happy 🤣 well done 👏🏻
Quality, well done mate
Tbh I had a little cry when she fired up and roared the second time, total magic after all the trials. What a car this will be! Your dad deserves his own special rebuild but I bet he’s loving doing it with you, Hanna and crew 🎉🎉
It’s alive well done all of you little bit different From the TT you did but mate your face said everything

Can't understand why I'm so happy that you managed to start it 🎉 Nice work Matt!
I love how these videos bring people from all cultures/religion/views together. Nothing but respect for all the hard work that goes into these projects. Ps I love your dad man!

This is crazy I didn’t expect Tavarish
Absolutely brilliant 😊
i don't know why but while watching this  video i had a huge smile on my face
Impressive all that work. Well done.
Mat and Freddie are such an underrated duo ❤
I've never been this happy to see a car start 😭😭😂😂😂
Enjoyed this build❤
Sweeeet..
Legend!🎉
Epic 🤣 I think I laughed and willed it to start as much as you guys ! Well done 👍
Matt You are doing fantastic job. The way you narrate your videos use timelapse is exceptional and best in YouTube. I rarely watch these car build videos but now I am addicted to it because of you and I only watch your channel for car build videos. I hope you get my point.
I'm so happy for you, what an inspiration, thank you Mat!
I was just sitting here smiling waiting for it to turn over
Brilliant to hear that fire up,we;; done the Aemstrongs and the team.
I was on the edge of my seat willing it to start ,what a fantastic video mat,on wards and upwards now.
yoooooooooo im jealous asf, so much hard work but sick
lmao.      BODGERS                         well done though
Congratulations on this achievement. So many things I could say here but the highlights here are all the hard work your dad and friends have put in this and the fact that Freddie was here shows the great collab work and content all you guys are putting out there on youtube. Who knew that tensioning a belt needed to be done by sound? I learned that from you Mat. That’s the content you are putting out there, never heard of it before. Looking forward to the next amazing video.
Congratulations 🎉
Seeing the engine crank has legitimately got me in tears. I'm really glad to see you being really successful doing what you enjoy. Keep up the great work, Mat
14:25 alot of engine this is! 👌🏼😋
The woopomb
Handwork paid offf😀😀👍🏻🤩
YES! I got tingles when it started up, I can't imagine how you must have felt after all the work you've all put in! Having lost my dad recently it's so much more special to see you do this with your dad and see the excitement from you both. It's always been my dream to own and work on a fast car and your videos make me want to do it even more. What an incredible channel you've created!
Your dad is great Mat, what a great experience working with him on this build.
The timing seems to be off. Also, whatever small amount of oil pressure generated using the starting motor, compared with what you will have now, is a big difference, so pay very close attention for any leaks from both the heads and the lower portion of the engine. Hope some adjustments gets it humming along as it was designed. Great job.
Such genuine excitement what an absolute brilliant video.
👏👏👏💪💪💪great moments you lived and show us,wish you the best from a sub in Portugal 🇵🇹😉
Since Tavarish has helped you a lot in rebuilding the Porsche 911 GT3 and this Lamborghini Murciélago. I think you should pay him back by helping him with his McLaren P1.
excellent video brother. excellent work too & you’re pops
Great video !!!!!!!  But I sounds like timing or cylinder order is not right
Love your attitude, everyone seems so positive and I'm praying you get it running soon
Congratulations great job 🔥💪
congrats buddy
Ooooooh man ... Come on..... Lets go.... So happy Mat baba
Dude that sounds mint, well done to yourself and the old man 👏👏👏👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻

LEGEND BUDDY GREAT VIDEO 👍👍
🥺🥺🥺❤️🖤 the wait is over
The joy & look on your face, says it all Matt.  Another milestone accomplished.....👍👏👏👏
Omg this is amazing!!!!! Well done Matt you’ve come so far ❤
Yyyeeeeeesssss 🏎💨 that was so awesome hearing it run properly for a few sec’s. Legit emotional that, the grind has paid off , you guy’s have done a great job. Can’t wait to see the next murci video.👌
👏👏
When it popped and banged into life you should’ve given your dad a massive hug! You might not realise it, but you’re making great memories together!
Amazing, so pleased for you all, all the hard work you have put in, fantastic. 👍
Wow cant believe the work you put in, living the dream too! All much deserved but seeing the smile on your dads face when it started was beautiful, congrats guys cant wait to see it painted and looking brand new!!
I must admit that you did a pretty impressive job getting that murcie running. A lot of incompetent idiots have worked on it, pretty much to the point it was almost impossible to repair everything they f'd up.  A lot of experienced mechanics would pass on this job. Respect.
Congradulation!
CONGRATULATIONS. BRILLIANT
Been a great series .  cabt wait to see it finished what a project
I can feel your excitement exactly. I had the same level of joy and nervousness when I rebuilt my first Range Rover engine.
YES MAT, WELL DONE TEAM  THIS IS THE CONTENT I CRAVEEEEEEEEEE
Well done Mat 🫡🫡🫡👏👏🤝
Craaaazy great job guys.
Well done both of you🎉 Big respect ✊
Your Dad is a legend. He should have a first-turn key. and that is an honor for Dad.
Finally lol 🚶🏻
Awesome stuff Mat.  Mega congratulations on getting the engine rebuilt and started successfully- incredible achievement and goes to shows persistence and hard work pays off. Amazing 🤙💥
Mats a beaut,makes errors and just ploughs on,not letting an issue beat him!Massive props brother, rooting for u!🦾🦾🦾

OMG.... what a moment when it started!!!!! I shared the joy!! 😆!!

A W E S O M E
👏
Lots of work and patience....master mechanics
Is alive alive after 7 years.Exellent job guys
🫡👍🇸🇪
Really loved the video, very emotional. I crossed fingers thrice and really happy the car started!!!. You have a gift in creating YouTube videos ❤❤❤❤
I'm Soo happy for Mat
Don't  give up ,I felt like that when my car broke a camshaft yesterday  after building it for 7years
This is the best channel ever on You Tube. 😊 Really needed a smile on this Monday evening and thanks to you, Mat...I got one....or rather a few. Fantastic video dude.
Don't think I've ever smiled so much at a youtube vid when she fired up. Your energy is contagious!! 😅  Well done to you and your dad dude. Legends! 🤘🏻
Sunny at BHP fixed my low oil pressure broke Gallardo.. Legend ❤
All the way in South Africa....I really enjoyed this one. Great one Matt...
Very clever with the mhz sound check= YOU GO GET EM MY FRIEND
Great to see Tavarish in the video. I suppose tightening the belt is just flicking the bean the right way lol. Is this when a Lambo was a Lambo and not a mixture of spare parts left over from the VW parts bin?
I’m loving it 😂🎉👍🏻
Congratulations bro!!!
Cannot believe you bought that for £100k
With Ricky and Freddy around it was bound to only go one way! Good stuff
This video is going to get a million views in no time brilliant episode I was sat on the edge of the sofa 🤣🤣🤣🤣great series this is.
Yahoooooo 😀
Huge congratulations to you and your awesome dad! 🎉 you guys really made me smile seeing your hard work pay off getting the engine firing. Keep it going I can’t wait for your next upload on this.
well Matt and team..great job
Absolutely brilliant 👏
FINALLYY
fantastic guys well done everyone!
So pleased for you all, massive sense of achievement 👏👏
Good one Matt
Inspiring content from the start to now 🇳🇬🇳🇬
that was awesome
Amazing amount of work Mat! 😵. I changed a rear wiper motor on my Q5 today and thought I was a mechanic 😂🤣😂 That was insane!…..
Omg that was great I sat he wishing it to start .... you and your Dad and Amazing family 😊😊
Please don't tell me you used that shitty universal ebay o-ring to seal the oil sump...
And that makes it ALL worthwhile!
To be fair, ppl who sold you Murci should give you part of your money back - the amount of hidden problems in this car is/was outstanding. 100k sounds like a scam.
I was smiling, almost screaming and enjoyed watching how the engine turns over. I love cars, so I was glad to hear the engine runing. I like your channel and I also like you. I wish you all the best, Mat!
Fantastic result congratulations m8
Well done to you and your dad Mat. We’ve been waiting for this for so long it’s been like waiting for someone to give birth 😂. Made up for you mate 👍🏼.

I don't know why I was smiling watching to whole video Armstrong family congratulations you guys have done it 🎊
Your show is fantastic! But seeing you guys working with Freddy is  awesome! I've watched him since day one! I would love to know is he as nice in the flesh? He seems a great guy who wears his heart on his sleeve.
Oh wow, didn’t expect to Freddie at your unit!! Great job there dude, and your dad is a legend. Great video Mat
I'm always smiling watching there's vlogs excellent.
Bro I was here at 100k subscribers, mental. All deserved
Well done mate! So happy for you ❤❤🎉🎉🎉
And when you put the engine back, and you see that, oh f**k we left a screw out!😂
GREAT job Matt, AND your dad! But PLEASE keep an eye on that oil pressure gauge during these first starts…💪🏼
You and Freddie are going too have an amazing friendship ❤️ wish I had a dad like yours ❤
Enjoyed this so much❤
Fuck yeah , good job
Matt this made me genuinely smile and nearly cry. Well done mate
Honestly what makes me watch Matt’s videos is the sense of humor and the friendship with his dad  !! Keep it up bro !! Best wishes from Jerusalem 🙏
Great work Matt and very importantly Dad lol genuinely smiling with your enthusiasm and your well deserved success. I would love to paint that car for you but my location in belfast doesnt help much lol😊
Hi Mat, I honestly enjoy your videos, and I would say it's such a good sight seeing you achieve all your dreams. Well done, mate.  All the from Africa Namibia 🇳🇦🤜🏾🤛🏾.
I am so glad Mat the engine started 🫶🏼your dad needs a massive hug from you at the end 👏🏽
So nice to see this car start after the sorry state it was in when you found her 🎉😊
Damn Italians, the timing belts on my ducati are tensioned the same way. My fingers were raw from plucking those things. Enjoying the build Mat.

Your dad was so happy when the casing was put on. It just made my day ! good job guys :)
This was an emotional watch😅
Mike essa coming in clutch here too
Well done young Mat. You would have made a great Royal Marine Commando as our ethos is:  courage, de- termination, unselfishness, and cheerfulness in the face of adversity, of which you have loads.
So happy for ya lad 👍👍👍
Sooooooooo awesome
damn you can see the 7years of standing still trying to shoot out
Your Dad is an absolute legend and his laugh is the best! Infectious as 10! ✌️
You can't imagine how hard I screamed when the murcie started.... Now I know all car guys have one heart❤
Class…..well done Mat

Well done guys - keep up the good work. I'd have set fire to the thing by now!!!

surly you could of unscrewed those studs making it hard to place the cover on and then put them back in once the cover was in place.
Your timing is badly out.. you need to recheck that all your marks are on spot otherwise you will be replacing that motor. Well done so far.. good work and i agree with some of the people here.. Build your dad a next car and at the end give it to him.. Think he will appreciate it.. All the best out of a sunny Southern Africa!!!
thats nice!
You and your dad are absolute legends!!!   Kevin is alright too 🤣🤣🤣
Woohoo, awesome
It is more than Awesome that your father is working together!!! A Dream! Respect for his support on his son! Thanks to Freddie for flying across the big pond! Love your work and devotion, bros!
Yessssssssssss, result, hard work pays off, well done mate.

I'm calling the premature gasket failure now before I see the end. Figured as much. Great trick with the sheet metal though. Let's hope the head gasket survives the track. Keep up the good work Mat.
Crazy engine-start - congratulations
Amazing work by you and the team, well done all of you!
Brilliant sounds awesome well done Mat 👍👌

Outstanding, I was nervous for you both....   Really is true, if you put your mind to it anything is possible... Such an inspiration... Keep going Matt I look forward to every episode. 😉

Well done for getting Lamborghini up and running after all his time u done amazing job it’s been well worth waiting for can’t wait till it’s complete so we can see what it looks like love watching your videos keep them coming
whoever said the o-ring couldn't be done, is the same guy that wears a helmet when on the toilet.   Sincerely, 2-time Master Technician.
I enjoyed this 1 more, Mat. Brilliant !
So casually standing on the engine 😅
From experience if a gasket requires clamp down then that is what must be done. Well done  though, as a mech of 35 years I admire your work
Amazing congrats🎉
Looked like you and ya dad wanted to cuddle when it started
10/10
Lets gooooo I’m going bonkers !!!
Absolutely brilliant lads , we’ll done 👍👍
Ah love dad! Bloody legend
👏👏👏👏👏
I think why I like your channel so much is all the laughter, yall are the best lol

Old timer seems like a fun person to be around. I like his sense of humour.
I just love it freddy turns up to gives a   hand aswell, well done to you and your father mat all the hard work paid off 🎉❤
Ffs why has watching this vid put me in such a good mood 😊
Well done lads..

I am addicted to this channel..love the mat Freddie and dad colab...I can't wait to see the Lambo roar down the street..
We need to help mat build his father's dream car. Would be great content on your next build
Deserves all the love damn boiii she thicc
Mad that the first time I watched you was 2k subscribers and a e350! You need to get on the mercedes again! UK's cheapest G WAGON
Mega! I felt like I was there watching the key turn!! 😂 What a moment!!!
I jumped and cheered when it fired up!  Awesome!
fabulous stuff Matt!
🌹🌹🌹❤❤❤❤
Love this show
The collab between mat and tavarish is awesome
Matt unfortunately the only way to do it is to strip down and fit the o rings properly as they will always be suspect.
Mate, I hope part 11 is out soon. Dying to see this cruising round Leicester soon!
Bro why does it take my mechanic 2 weeks to change a fuckin gasket. These guys bang out engine swaps in a few days
So chuffed for you Mat 👍😃.  I really felt your pain with the oil leak issues, but when it finally fired up, just brilliant.  It'll be a shame to spoil the sound by hooking up those headers to the exhaust system 😁  Great job!!!
Love the way you're dad helps out, it's amazing to see a father and son team. He's living the dream being an international jet set Youtube superstar
Honestly Matt I have to say what An Amazing video , you and your Dad have a great bond and truly are great .. well done to everyone that features in the video ..👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🔥
I actually made great experience with these universal rubber seal packs. Had a leak of coolant on a sensor for like 4 years and I always replaced the sensor like 3 times with the seal. But then I got a thicker one from such a box and it sealed my engine finally after 4 years of leakage. They compress much more and hold up nicely!
Wow just wow! So chuffed for you!
Congratulations, so happy for you, so much hard work you and your dad have put in to this you deserve it
Most belts today are tuned with a fork to the right tightness. They have digital meters also
That is completely amazing much respect for you Matt and your father.
Love that Freddy was there.
Brilliant
Well done cherish your dad , lost  mine 4 years ago and still miss him everyday , you are blessed to have him help you on some off your projects.
What a guy subbed from like 10k
I have followed the series from the beginning and I surely clapped when the engine finally worked. Congrats! Times the word Murcielago has been butchered: 23191 times.
Sitting in a train, in a box of 4, with 3 copassagers wondering what the hell I am watching to be smiling and rocking back and forth to help that engine start😅 Great Job Mate!
Great job!!! You got my biggest smile today 😊
Brought a little tear to my eye...... so pleased for you and your dad well done
LETS GOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
it's alive, can't wait to see it go down the road. Congrats
Your dad smiles more than you!! your blessed to have that family support.
Thanks mat for these kind of video, really appreciate it!
Brooooo! Finally! I felt an incredible tension before starting the Murci, I literally had tears coming up my eyes seeing all the emotions that were with you all at the garage. The fact that you gave your viewer the honor of trying to start the car you've been working on for so long shows just how much you respect your audience. Incredible work, keep it up!
Can't wait for the next part, its my favourite serie

Wow Matt! Followed this journey from the beginning- I actually got emotional when she fired into life! Amazing!
EPICSTUFF
Congratulations, Matt. You are a star
this lamborghini engine is an absolute nightmare i would keep the frame and put a v 12 bmw engine
Finally!
Congratulations 🎉👏🎉👏 😭😭😭
I am so happy! looking forward to see it finished.
i said from the start you could of used a spark plug feeler gauge to get the o-rings seated before the shim plate was suggested, but then again you have to be a mechanic to know these things not an Amateur Mechanic that knows nothing. the difference is simple theirs Google Mechanics and Technical Engineers
I’m loving the Lamborghini rebuild so much what a car can’t wait to see what colour you paint it 👍👍👍
Goosebumps 🤩
I was so happy when it started, i literally stood up and danced for a whole 2 minutes 🔥🔥🔥🔥😂

Hey Mat...So happy you back on the Murcielago..The most exiting project in my opinion...Probably coz it is an legendary analog V12 manual and that i had it on a  poster on my wall back in the days...btw great to see "REPerformance UK" on the vlog😇✌
Favourite channel on YouTube by far, always enjoy the videos 🫡👌
Matt, just watching your sheer excitement and pleasure from hearing it start made my day, long work and many hours to see that smile on your face. Cannot wait to see the lambo back to its former glory. Amazing and hard work so far. Not long and your dream car will be an amazing reality. ❤❤
yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
I was so pissed when you tried to fit the cover without taking the heads off how it was supposed to be done (for a reason). But I am happy everything worked out for you; the moment when engine started was really breathtaking. Awesome!
YESSSS MURCIELAGO VIEDOOOOOOOO, i was hoping to get the notification,
Brilliant
I actually low-key use your videos to get non car people into cars 🥲
It's alive 😎
*YOUVE SMASHED IT MATE!* 🔥
Almost had tears in my eyes😂😂 what a journey, music to my ears with that v12 pumping!!
It's started!!!😅😅
Mat can you help me rebuild an m4
Proud of you pal, watched most of your videos and this one had my legs arms and fingers crossed 😂
I’ve never shouted come on, so many times in my life can’t believe it’s running well done Matt 😊
I need more!
Did Matt just reference DDE
literally shed a tear watching that
👌👌👌👌
I'm on the edge of my seat here Mat, you guys are brilliant, can't wait to see this out on the road!
I don’t know who’s more happy you or your dad so happy to see you both enjoy a project together
Energy and happiness can be seen when the engine starts ❤..... Hard work paid off ... Being a mechanic it feels great..... Good job...❤❤...it this video it seen very easy to remove front timming cover....but in reality, it's not easy..... Great job buddy....

THIS SHIT LIT 🔥
The  dream  of super cars
I was so, so willing it to start! Well done
Brilliant!  I shouted with you when it caught for the first time. Well done to you all
Could have used feeler gauges instead of sheet metal.
I have never been so happy to see a car turnover in all my life lol
Everything always seems to work out when Freddy comes into the picture 👏
you must fell sooo chuffed, another dream come true, keep going as you only lose when you quit
A moment of magic watching that Italian V12 dragged kicking and screaming back into life against all odds. Kudos!

It's like witnessing the re-birth of a raging bull. Go ahead Lamborghini!
Man! I was on pins and needles!!!  Can’t wait to see the next one.

Absolutely brilliant. I was cheering you on. Nearly there 👏👏👏
Definitely gotta stay the lambo green
So cool that Tavarish is there!!
We’ll don my Respect
Amazing video! Got me on the edge of my chair haha!
i was waiting for this video
Love the Lamborghini start up for the first time 😮❤
Awesome work 👏 and Freddy has been busy on his holiday 😮
Amazing! Can't wait for the next one!
Such a fantastic story with every video Mat. Love the way you give back to the the people by allowing a first start to a viewer! Great news that you got it started!!
For someone to make a comment that gets 1k likes then edits it so it doesn't make sense 😂😂😂
Sure these videos of any thing he does getting better and better!! Let's goo matt!
And like father like son,,funny when they work together😂😂😂
You're making me want to buy a Gallardo and do everything I can to own one
Nice touch with Lee
Congratulations on starting it
Mat and Autoalex are my favourite YouTubers by far. Both are just really likeable guys with equally likeable teams around them. I’d love to see a collaboration one day.
Why was I super excited I almost clapped my hands when Lee got it running? Hahahah
Love a great Bromance!! ❤ this is awesome we go Zoooom soon 😂
Well done 👍
What's Tavarish doing over there he has a P1 to build lol
Heck yes. I was literally on my chair, cranking my own arm as the engine kept trying to start. I hope all goes well and that you are able to fully restore it.
The smile on my face while watching this says it all!  Incredible!!!
Nice one Matt and the team👍
Got goosebumps when it started up, Can only imagine how you feel 😆 Is Freddy still here or has he gone now?
I smiled so hard the end.
The amount of ads in this video is shocking
Richard Hammond was right, you are mad.
Well done, you answered my question from Saturday outside Wembley
The Lamborghini lives finely you did it I'm so proud of you
Some seriously brave shortcuts there guys but well estimated. Sounds like the timing is off but not by much as it runs. So much fun to be able to mess about with an engine like that. Big respect!
I think it was Matt's skinny jeans that made the Lambo run again 😂...or his giggly laugh
15.5k views within minutes 😮
waiting for the gt3 video😤
The smile on my face before i click on these videos is unreal❤️
Mat mate! I can rest now 😂😂😂😂 well done! congratulations!!
I bet your dad never imagined that he would be someday working on he's sons Lamborghini.  Fkn awesome 👌 please build him he's dream car.. Cheers 🍻 from  Sydney 🇦🇺 Australia
Best video ever, genuinely got excited for you. Amazing work
Respect for all the hard work and problem solving!
Absolutely amazing work guys you could see how proud mat was brilliant 👏 😊
My god,...it's like a horror movie. So exciting. 🫣
I was literally grinning the whole time the engine was being cranked.. So happy to see it finally run..  I'll be here impatiently waiting for what's to come!
<3333
Just brilliant
Waited for long finaly
Mat, brother trust me i watch your vids on M5, GT3 and other cars x100000 times, i love it and can't wait for the next episodes... I'm addicted... jesus <3 much love
🥳😀👊👊👍👍👍
The smiles when it sat there idling. I was smiling too, fantastic work!
The moment we were all waiting for ....... Sooooooo cool that the Lambo starts! Good for U 🥳
When you were cranking it for oil pressure, the fuse for the fuel pump should have been removed 😅
Mat is such a blast!!
This guy makes me happy 😄
Video dropped right on time for my lunch break at work lol Congrats on getting it started! Love the channel!!!
Oh mate, it made me emotional in the end.
Lookin awesome Mat, congrats to Lee, love watching the series. Much love from United States!

Brilliant no fear, just pure sending it from you Matt, had me smiling from ear to ear 👍
We need a separate account for your dad he is a legend! Lost my dad when I was young and I used to rebuild cars and tractors with him and this brings me so much joy and memories! Actually went on to be a mechanic and even I’m learning so much from your videos! Love it

Mat, your channel is the only one I am always checking for new videos. That is totally incredible. I love the content you create - well done !
Brilliant nuff said ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Congrats! You'll get it run smoothly next episode 😍👍
Looks like the engine bay of a TANK, maybe the lifters needed oil pressure to get the valve lash right? O oil pressure was needed somewhere else like on a sensor or something,
She's alive
nice one!
I’m here going come ooooonnnnn!!!!!!😂
Back from the dead...
😂👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿 Here I am gave up my books just so I get to cheer up my night with the first start up. 😂😂👏🏿Damn I'm so happy 🇿🇦
Your dad is cute as a button. Great upload Matt and crew
Huge congrats on that!!! Much respect

Bloody brilliant well done Matt and your team 👍
This was so sick
LOVE IT!!!
Watching and waiting for that to start was more exciting and nerve wracking than watching England in a penalty shoot out!! 🎉 Absolutely brilliant mate! 😁👏🏼
Wish i had a dad like Mat's🫡🔥💖
Toyota does this with the older 22re motor. The front timing cover goes on first then the head.
ive watched this series wit my family and every sunday we sit down and watch your videos cheers mat for the amazing content
I know the feeling when that fired!!!!! After building my car, there’s nothing like it! ( for car guys/girls). Amazing to see, great job Lee!
The car isnt even mine and i felt so happy by it starting and proud of you, love the vids
Awsome Matt, great team effort.
Not me jumping in my room! Loool  Happy for you Matt!
Mat at what point can you officially say you are a mechanic 🤣
AMAZING JOB MATT!! CONGRATS!! this is delightfull to watch!
Good on you Mat
Well done Lee,  Mat it sounds really raw
Is it jus me or Mat looks like Andrew Tate ?
Rebuild the chrome BMW 5 series next?😂
How many 'all time dream cars" do you have?
Despite having a cold you still have that enthusiasm. That made me grin from ear to ear. One step closer bud.
Fantastic chuffed for you and your dad, I'm sure you both aged 10 years in that video tho
INSTANTLY STOPPED MY WORK TO COME AND WITNESS THIS MAGICAL MOMENT! CONGRATULATIONS MAT! :D
Congratulations mat all your hard work has paid off. You've finally got the V12 running, great video by the way Regards Robert from Paris France
5 000 000 views 💪
to many adverts now
with all the time and effet you have put into the car its a bit late for short cuts
I'm smiling from ear to ear! Well done Matt to you and your helpers. Sounds awesome!
Mad! Nothing but smiles with you guys as progress started to show with it turning over, and the pops and bangs and flames was crazy! 😂😂 get in!!!!!!!
Unbelievible work Mat! Greetings from Germany!
Sounds rather good after 7 years!
Congratulations Mat for all the good work on it
YEAH BOIIIIIIISS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
you can go to a mileage correction workshop and they can program your new clocks to the last known mileage you know of. at least that way it doesnt look like youve given it a haircut. and it only costs a couple hundred quid you may even get it for nothing if you give them a mention
It looks like it’s running super rich and not burning all of the fuel. I would get it tuned before running again. 🫣
Awesome job matt and dad on the rebuild just gotta get the running smoothly the hardest part is hopefully done 🎉🎉
Top team 👍
Your telling me 😂 they never started it before the guy who brought a t shirt 😂😂😂😂😂
Sickkk !!! Well done
Mat I don’t think I’ve ever wanted to see something start so much. Amazing mate months off hard work. You did it. Be proud off yourself that’s made my day
Well done, what a result! 😄
The joy on Mat's face
Man that laugh it shows how much he went through with that one. #OnwardsAndUpwards. Cheers Mate. You have done it.
Awesome

Well done mate,

FFS that was like watching England winning a penalty shootout competition in the World cup. On the edge of my seat, not breathing.
Sketchy this
Congratulations 🥳 😊☘️☘️☘️
Instead of shim steel just use feeler gauges, like .0010 to hold it in place.
I really love your videos and I really appreciate the effort you put in them
Yes yes yes well done guys

Freddie beings around everyone happy, makes me happy. I love the collabs!!
From dead to alive! You really deserve that car! don't even sell it
It was a surprising that Freddie came to the UK to help! Loving the Murci content!
It sounded like it getting rid of the junk fluids before it got to the new stuff.
Ah, the absolute joy and relief when that casing went on (with some gentle persuasion) 😂
What talent
Well done mate been a long time coming can’t wait to see it flying  down the road 😍
Finally
am super happy for you 🇩🇰🇩🇰👍
That’s the happiest I’ve seen Mat ..absolutely brilliant
been Waiting for long, but here it is
Freddy was a pleasant surprise as always
DDE fam
Sounds sweet once it got running 👌
Finally you post the video Mat, I also rebuilt a car inspired by you and I'm in Africa
Anyone else watching this and thinking it would have taken less time to just do it right the first time?
This is an old video,  why is it appearing in my notifications?

You’re so amazing mat I love this car and you’re such a hardworker keep up the good work

Doesn't sound to healthy 😅
The best part for me i'snt only the murciellago starting up but seeing Freddy together in this project is incledble
Lamborghini used to build tractors....by the sound of that car you'll understand why 😂

This channel is addictive 😂
NICE VID
You live my dream Man. Bravo.
Father son goals.

Think samcrac did sound thing to his ferrari.
Well Done Mat !!!!!!! 🍻🍻
❤
The smile on my face when the engine started, amazing stuff dude! Fingers crossed the engine doesn't have to leave the car too many more times!
Do it right the first time and save time in the long run...or not
Mate, I nearly refused to work today - can’t start the week without a Mat rebuild fix.
You are the man! Such a joy watching that……🎉🎉
The cars name should be Samir now hahaha
Have been waiting for the update 🎉😊
paint it grey like the batman murci. then keep that green interior. could be 🔥
this movement made me  cry🥲
At last here's the continuation 😊😊😊
That was fucking sick my man what a hero
Please see my comment mat😢
Casing torqued to spec ofc! Love it mate buzzing for your videos every single week
Ur dad is such an legend, maybe an idea to rebuild your dad’s dream car next and then give it to him when it’s done! Love your videos Matt, all the best from the Netherlands.
Hows it going with the 911?
Love these. But he's got more money than sense. This car has took ages. He's been America living his dream. He's got houses that he rents out. What a guy
finally lambo
Yeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhhh🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
More dad armstrong on the channel!!!
It’s about time the car moves again, I have followed the build from the first episode
Why are there comments saying the video is great, when it's not been up long enough to watch?
Your dads laugh makes me crease!🤣🤣
Congratulations on getting the merci started after 7 years, massive win man!
On a scale of 1 to 10 using the bodge-o-meter that cam chain cover fitting is a solid 18 😂😂😂, Well done though Matt 👍
Seeing you celebrate with your Dad really put a smile on my face
Freddy in the UK! Its alive!!!
