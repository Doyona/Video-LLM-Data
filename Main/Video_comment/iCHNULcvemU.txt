Campeonato Francês 1992 - 1993
How many eyes messi is having 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What would be PSG without Messi ? No doubt he is the greatest in the futbol universe.
Szia tesóm
Gosh the Toulouse Goally is really good!
Mbappe has become rather very selfish
Being in PSG means a lot of loses for Messi😪
Management of Toulouse FC must sells stocks 33,33% on the Paris Stock Exchange like Juventus, AS Roma, Lazio (Italy) to be a Top Club in France . :)
Only good thing about toulouse was their keeper Maxine Dupe
Neymar is on fire, Messi's assists are God-like and it's so refreshing to see PSG come with some clean sheets but I think if Mbappe passed more often in some cases they'd sure have more goals as a team.
It's incredible how Messi has changed his game since joining PSG. Good thing is there's still a lot to come. He is evolving better than ever.
Mbappe is too selfish, Messi assisted him in his goal why didn't he assist Messi
Messi is too class and too good, for these PSG scrubs.
They're about Toulouse
Ever since messi joined psg, most of mbappe goal are assisted by him, and mbappe has many more chances of scoring than before ever since the goat joined... Will mbappe ever realise that? Or is he just selfish?
🍑🔥
Farmers league😂😂😂😂
PSG , you shuffle the cards ..
The most perfect finisher Mbappe what a great player. unfortunately too many haters may be because of pogbas witchcraft he missed a lot
Liverpool
I hope that Mbappe reads the comments on this and many other youtube channels. Maybe that's how he realizes that despite scoring goals and being a great striker, Messi is still the center of all the comments, admiration and affection of all the people because in addition to being a star, he's simple, a good person and a great teammate.   "Learn this Mbappe because half of your goals you owe to Messi"
I want PSG to win champions league with this line-up
PSG is looking good but then again they always look the part against subpar competition.
2:30 mbappe pass the freakin ball man 🤷🏻‍♂️
1:57 that mbappe wouldn't have passed the ball just Messi did, still he cries.
France 💩💩💩💩💩💩
Underrated is one of the most misused words when referring to PSG's players. Absolute superstars everyone recognises and talk about constantly are always being referred to as underrated.
W8W ^^ Very Nice :D
Mbappe is not good for the team
Leo😍
neymar jogou muito mas o goleiro do outro time jogou demais
Mbape most selfish player ever, feel bad for Mesi. He shouldn't play in same team with him.
Mbappe GOAT of PSG.the rest of the team is well,the rest of the team...this is Mbappe club😎💪

We love mess only
Ici c'est Paris Gggggg... c'était bien écrit dans l'évangile, on attendais tous le retour du Messie... on a reçu Messi 😎
I watch this match to see messi only ❤️
Mbappe kinda selfish
No UCL for you this season as usual 😂🤣😂
Papo reto, o dia que o Mbappe soltar a bola o mundo acaba namoral!!
Second assist was best 😌
Neymar goal was text book tiki-taka, Paris edition.
Neymar Messi epic players
Review start to football in India...this is very important thing in football ........I don't see indian football game par review start ho gaya..
Mbappe is selfish 😪😪😪😪
Mappé como sempre fominha sem dá assistência
Am really happy on how messi is being the provider for both ney and mbappe
Mbappay just want,s to score Even messi gave him a assist first he didn't gave him When he came face to face with keeper
Neymar💖
👍for efforts in commentary
Is it true that League 1 is a farmer's league?
Messi fans takes out their frustration on Mbappe. Even when the golden boi peforms better both Messi and naymer. You never acknowledge the Mbappe as he overshadowed both. The boy shall rise, even when he passes Messi an he doesn't capitalize the chance. the boy scores almost every game if not all games, have you seen given credit no, I head some of the haters when the golden boy scores many goals, they praise naymer and Messi then say Mbappe is doing his job on the same game wdf is that supposed to mean. Messi is goat fully agree, but remember, every player's prime comes to end, so will Messi's, He's legacy will remain.
Mbappe still need to learn to pass the ball, when it matter the most....
Bruv Messi passed to mbappe there even if he could score if mbappe would've been there he would have taken a shot Leo🪄✨
I am here just to watch Messi's performance
Мне так нравится, когда приходит уведомление: "У вас появился новый подписчик" и "Ваш комментарий кому то понравился" меня так радует! Дай бог здоровья тем кто заметил!😇👍❤🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Look everyone at Leo… truly a footballer with class. What a class and humility. He was the best player and now the best assist
Messi🔥
No veo ninguna comparación entre leo y Ronaldo, Messi es el mejor de la historia. Hay una comparación entre lebron y Jordan pero eso no se puede comparar porque son de dos etapas diferentes. Messi es obviamente el mejor jugador de la historia y no por lo que hizo hoy si no por ser el jugador perfecto y hasta cuando se nota que el y cristiano son lejos de sus mejor habilidades Messi sigue brillando como playmaker y Ronaldo como daña vestuario con todo el respeto. Sinceramente pienso que Messi es número 1 de la historia del fútbol y Ronaldo 2 y no hay nada malo en eso, siendo hincha del chelsea y mi equipo favorito en España es el Sevilla así que no soy hinca ni del Madrid y ni del barca
Could the Messi fans shut the fck up? There are literally 11 players playing on the psg team okay!? 11. And all i see in the comments is MESSI, MESSI AND MESSI. Disgraceful fans that shouldn't belong to football. Its totally unfair to all the other players in the field. Lets imagine, Donnarumma or Navas saves 20 shots in a single game and Messi only played simple passes throughout the game (which all the other players did as well). Trust me you would see top comments about Messi only. Thats how disgraceful thier fanbase are
Hello everyone,wish you a blessed day,if someone wanna heel there soul ,I have a video for you with a beauty of my Asian village https://youtu.be/y9yUZjpQrIc🤗🤗
Messi veratti the venom for others in worldcup. These playmakers will rule qatar mid field. Scaloni "may we come in"
Great front three partnerships thrive on balance and a strong midfield for the most part. If this front three want to thrive they need to find their roles. It wasn't all that hard for MSN, but not everyone is MSN. Seems like Messi is find by playing facilitator for the egotists 😂 All jokes aside though, this might be how they make it work. Never would've imagined the GOAT decides to do this but hey... 🤷‍♂
Messi best skills and goals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5xYlvteJc
Messi best skills and goals https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O5xYlvteJc
Que egoísta es mbappe.
messi did such a nice pass, wish mbappe didnt squander opportunities, scoring well, but could score more.
messi playing like his normal legendary self but he gotta improve his finishing, thats all i got say, epic player still and doing what he needs to do, but i want to see him score goals as well its nice. still scoring good tho just want more :D. messi magic
Messi getting ready for the world cup can't wait
really poor choice of kits . quite similar
Lionel Messi e Neymar são os melhores  jogadores do mundo ,,só os números dizem por si só
MESSI KING
https://youtu.be/yRGjs3nYAXU
If mbappe and Messi were opposite , mbappe woulda taken that shot even with no angle
If PSG bought Ronaldo, this channel would've been on more than 8 million subscribers already .. sometimes u need to think for the future 😁🤣
Neymar deveria ir pra Premier League, francesão é água com açucar pra um crack como ele.
Nice
Messi 🐐
Soccer sucks, stay off my feed. I all ready had your garbage channel blocked.
People only see and talk about who scored the most goals, but just look at Leo's assists here, he is unstoppable this season!
Mbappe is not a good player, he's arrogant.... He can't do anything by himself he's just used others to make himself shine
Messi the goat 🐐 🙌 😎
Mbapppe always like to be selfish
2:00 Messi dribble on the left, and assists MBappe. 0:53 MBappe dribble on the left, and won't assist anyone, tried to go alone and miss goal. 2:30 MBappe goes alone, he could dribble and pass to the right, but he went alone, and miss the goal. This year MBappe has decided not to be top assister, lol. He thinks he can win Champion Leagues along by himself.
MBappé je t'adore, mais pas ce soir... MBappé I adore you, but not tonight...
Y'all just hating on Neymar 🔥🔥 Y'all know nobody this season can be compared to Neymar GOAT,,
admit it or not idc but mbappe is one of the most selfish player i have ever seen ...see messi his attitude his discipline ..only skills will not make anyone the greatest ...
I'm starting to get disgusted by Mbappe's selfish ego, I see that moterfunka just wanting everything for himself, down with these clowns no matter how much talent, real character is showing talent via Team and not individual efforts
Psg defenders nd midfielders except verrati there is no one with good ball distribution ability ...everybody is afraid to make those key passes nd long balls to create panic nd  just  plays safe...those diagonal balls from messi when he roams around in the midfield are dangerous ...verrati's defensive traits are way way better ...they should hv gone for a quality midfield signing given the money they hv ...although vitinha looks promising..but this isn't enough for ucl
https://youtu.be/DTnY28eRLO4
Psg defence is doing 💩
If Mbappe is not selfish then Messi would had more goals this season
Top class from messi.psg in the right direction
Why did thwy buy donnaruma I will never understand, with Navas much better. And fibally hakimi in the bench, marquinhos should be seating next to him. The substitutes they have now.. Poor. Paredes should have stayed and play along verrati. Substitutes they have are very lame
Messi will the worldcup with argentina and he will take the spot of the goat.
Nể cái tình cảm anh em của Messi dành riêng cho Neymar quá từ BCA cho đến PSG vẫn không hề thay đổi khi chơi cạnh messi , neymar trưởng thành và chơi hay hơn nhiều giá như năm ấy ney chịu ở lại bca thì M10 sẽ giúp NM có được qbv trong sự nghiệp của mình rồi🥇
Mbappe is very selfish.just pass to the best positioned player😔
Mbappe tem que sair do time só atrapalha
really farmer league , messi makes it much better..
Messi is a god. This season 90% PSG goals were assisted by Leo.  He's truly a unstoppable machine even at 35  Don't forget bout Ney, he's conceding goals in every match. MAGICIAN 🥶  Mpaypal can't even score one by himself
Since Mbappe came back to line up Messi hasn't scored yet, I prefer Messi and Neymar relationship up front.
Selfish mbappe
Messi :- A playmaker with 335 Assists + 773 Goals
Ole Ole Oleeee, MESSI, MESSIIIII...!!!
Super !
Neymar good performance
Mbappe selfish Player in the history .. And PSG players other than Mbappe they are all good and deserved 👏.
Puta PSG
If Mbappe  passes the ball every game PSG can win every game but he is selfish
2:33 man, seriously, Messi was totally OPEN there.
I have noticed it a lot but Mbappe rarely squares the ball. He has many opportunities to do it in a single match but most of the time just shoots himself
Messi Veratti and Vitinha combo is so good
Championnat poulailler 🤣🤣🤣
it's sad seeing navas on bench 😢
Holy sh't Messi was amazing
Messi💪
Sept. 6 PSG vs Juventus.. De Maria goodluck
If psg wants to succeed they need to release this selfish kid mbappe or else   They won’t reach anywhere
Messi is a complete player,  always a big joy to watch him play, however this team wont be able to win  Uefa championship, will fail like last season.
Только чемпионат Франции опять выиграют) Бабки не работают
Beauty Neymar
Neymar is on fire, Messi's assists are God-like and it's so refreshing to see PSG come with some clean sheets but I think if Mbappe passed more often in some cases they'd sure have more goals as a team.
Even with newly promoted team, psg average performance
Como se dice : chupón, individualista o envidioso en inglés? , es para poder calificar a Kilian Mbappé.
Messi has made Neymar turned into a monster
Neymar
why are these commentators so dead
Mbappe selfish
Neymar revenge szn🔥
After so many years Messi still is the best football player, now he is the best, just in different way. His playmaking is so good man
Mbappe 😡 😡😡😡 git ders al biraz Messi  abinden   adamsın Messi Messi messii 🥰🥰🥰
Messi sen harikasın muhteşemsin en iyi sensin
Ok Messi was pretty good but Cristiano is still better lol
Neymar Ballon Dor alabilecek mi
Messi💙✨️✨️
Mbappe is too selfish
this ligue 1 channel seriously biased towards Messi, but put in mind because of Messi , you are being watched by more audience then you deserve
Messi o que, porra. O 10 é o Neymar e tá jogando como nunca no PSG.
Mbappe is a terrible finisher
Only Football lovers like me
Mbappe selfish level
I swear the pole has some personal grudges from Mbappe 💀  Well, good thing that Bernat converted that deflection into a goal
Messi is number 30, the Toulouse goalkeeper is number 30, so it was a twin situation, that's why he couldn't score, but it would have been a different situation if Mbappe were to passed the ball more often, Messi was wide open in multiple occasions.
1:58 Messi's ball control of those first few touches is just insane. Little things like these are easy to overlook, but it shows once more how insane his technique is. Controlling the ball the way he did, in that position, and at almost full speed is incredibly hard. 99.99% of the players wouldn't have been able to control it with the same efficiency and precision as Messi.
Vaya liga de mierda..... éstos no ganan una Champions en la vida!!!hala Madrid!!!
Türk yok mu lan en iyisi Neymar .
Mbappe has the worst finishing among that front 3 yet he doesn't like passing the ball, bring that to the Champions league, they will be eliminated quick
Mbappe going to destroy psg in champions league so much arrogant selfish person he will never reached the level of Holland I wish this is messi last season with him
Messi
Pessi ghost
Nop
Leo is too good 👍
I just love this man called Messi.💓💓💓💓
Is it me or someone else also saw where Messi squared a pass to Mbappe to score after that dribble but Mbappe with similar chance and Messi around, but went on to attempt scoring instead and didn't convert it... Their coach needs to work on it
Messi assits and passes 😘
This season neymar goals 70% assist given by messi💯
Smoga MNM makin berjaya diliga champions
The greediness of Mbappe is going to make them fail one more time. That guy is full of his own ego, too much money. Start to pass that ball
Mbape is selfish player 😪
Mbappe is very wasteful.
Neymar is playing with a chip on his shoulder this season. Has a point to prove to PSG top brass.
Messi king of football,
Great pass from messi
Mbappe is so fucking selfish.........
PSG IS SHIT THEY DONT HAVE HISTORY, THEY JUST WIN THE FRANCE SO BAD THIS CLUB
Fantastic ...
Even the selfish Ronaldo realized that sometimes is beter to pass than to shoot and got over 200 assists,  maybe those are not so complicated and through the lines assists like the ones by Ozil or Messi and are more equivalent to tap in goals cause they happened mostly to nearest teammate in the box but aniway.....this moron M`bappe is already finished if he continues to ignore his teammates and shoot from any angle through multiple defenders that are blocking the shoot.
Apakah formasi psg ini akan. berhasil di CL, saya meragukan nya
I see majority of sites are crediting 1 assist to Messi?  Is Ronaldo PR so strong or people that write articles doesnt watch the games that they are writing about?   I see clear 2 assists and few more chances created.
Mbappe is a stupid player 🤦‍♂️
Mbappe MF doesn't pass to any player😡
Good performance
Selfish mbappe 👎
Let's talk about how punk head mbappe would have ruined the same opportunity had he been in Messi's position instead of making a pass...that was his entire game all through. What a little man
Farmer legeue
Где Месси?🤣
1:12 goal  1:57 goal
How are they going to win if they are called "to lose"
I am a farmer from India so I watch the farmers league
Wtf is this commentary
Mbappe is too much selfish and he has no eligibility to play football. He is one of the worst players I have ever seen. Messi and Neymar have a few goals and assists only for Mbappe last season. Mbappe should leave psg only then PSG will win UCL. Mbappe is a wasteful genius🤣🤣🤣
Man! The toulouse goal keeper played well. But nobody cares.
What a waste mbappe is...😂😂
Once Mbape is with the ball he doesn't scan for a possible pass
Mbappe is being selfish in all of the matches  i’ve seen, he doesn’t pass the ball to Messi
Mbappe is really pissing me off with his selfish play......why not return the favour and pass to Messi too ....I would have been so pissed if I was Messi
Messi is just awesome.
I still see the same problem in mbappe's selfishness, his desire of personal glory will cost psg against big teams in the UCL
This match was brought to you by Veratti and Messi ❤️❤️
I never thought I'd ever say this but Messi is very underrated this season
Mbappe is shouting ,people.
Messi has to start playing selfish to score instead of passing to mbappe all the damn time , he should score those boys don’t respect him
2:15 watch it carefully Mbappe 🤢
Everyone is seeing just who are scoring goals but I think messi also should be credited cause how selflessly he is giving assists to score goals so easily True Goat 🐐
The greatest footballer of all time 🇦🇷
Messi the best player ever in football.
It's incredible how Messi has changed his game since joining PSG. Good thing is there's still a lot to come. He is evolving better than ever.
Now the rest of the world including PSG fans understand that Messi isn't ONLY built to score... he's been extremely important when Barca was down, helping with assists and play making... this boy is important to any team he'd play for... he just loved Barcelona by nature... never write him off cause he doesn't score like he used. He's matured to a bigger team player...
PSG If you want to win champion league just bench this shit Mbappe So selfish man he will destroy PSG mark my words 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Mbappe is clearly not a team player.
Messi is so much better already this season than last
Mbappe selfish
How can MBAPPE be so selfish ???😔
Messi🇦🇷
Mbappe is really selfish
Without that overrated, selfish and ego boy is much better! Please someone break his legs and keep him out of the season I will be very happy. This ego boy really pissed me off, never pass the ball to Messi, with this idiot boy no any chance to win CL. Lucky Madrid escaped from the most selfish guy of this planet😡
Imagine haaland playing with verrati messi and neymar  He would've been better than mbappe tbh, mbappe misses alot Haaland proving to be better than him in this season start
Mbappe you are paid to score sensational goals but you are not scoring te easy ones.....football is not just running faster than others....
Verrati and Messi are great together!! Dangerous playmakers, very beautiful to watch 👌🏽
Mbappe definitely needs to work more on his finishing it' unacceptable the amount of goals he loses face to face with the goalkeeper.
The link up between Messi, Verrati, Vitinha & Neymar 🔥🔥 As for Mbappe I'm disappointed
I noticed that messi was so unhappy today..He didn't smile for a single time..if mbappe has passed the ball to messi maybe messi could be on the scoresheet. Whatever messi played so good today. He was literelly unstoppable!
Messi 2 assist
Football is a team game and Mbappe is a solo player.
Messi being selfless again. Mbappe is very selfish.
messi
Actually lets agree the fact that messi wont score as much goals as he can not because he's failing but he's the best middlefield ,so his duty is to provides balls to the attackers like neymar and messi .and other thing is mbappe doesn't like messi at all lets agreed on that .i dont think even CR7 would done such thing to messi trust me ...CR7 he likes messi because he knows that man is provider but not selfish .
Messi assists Mbappe but Mbappe doesn't even pass to Messi.
Since ..Mbappe extend his contrcts ...why he was so selfish
Of course, their name is "To Lose" so what did y'all expect? lol
Verratti is the football 😍
Messi taking his time looking for loop holes on how to stop Mbappe at the coming World Cup 😎
Messi is too good for ligue 1
Mbappe be like i can't take back the ball inside the box..i try just to score.. Teammate..its ok its ok..u r selfish..
PSG will never succeed unless they get rid of the arrogant boy. They should have kept di María and sold mbape. He's bad for team spirit.
2:36  you can see mbappe withholding that sexy chance for leo to secure a sweet goal, but it’s all good.
Mbappe should've passed the ball at 0:55 instead of going for glory,  there were 2 players in far better position than him (One is ney and can't see the other one but he was just tap in from goal).
Njr ♥️ Leo♥️
Messi passes to mbapee but mbapee never pass back to messi
Neymar 🐐🐐🐐
Messi and Verratti are the type of players that very few teams have.  PSG can do things with them.
Mbappe just does not pass when it comes to goal. Expects all other team mates to pass the ball to him and let him score. He is too selfish this season.
Mark my words, Messi reaching 800 goals this season!
That goalie was fantastic.
Messi doesn't want to score anymore. He is working as a total CAM now.
Liga psg
Always LEO😈
Haaland is better than Mbappe
The assists from leo🔥🔥🔥
We've all all witnessed how great goalscorer Messi was,, and we're seeing Messi the playmaker,,, the guy is the greatest..
2:31 Why won't this guy cut back and give Messi a chance to score? Mbappe and his selfishness
Messi should leave PSG,,,,otherwise he has to assist more and more,,,,,,
Farmers👳
mbappe is a self centered and selfish footballer .. Always wanting to score all by himself. Messi passed the ball to him which he scored, but once his turn came to return the favour ,he refused to pass the ball to messi. Always playing like he is in a competition with his team mates...I am sorry, but with this attitude,i do not think psg would be able to win the champions league...
The only Reason I Watch PSG is because of Messi 👑.
This game should have ended with more than five goals if mbappe passed the ball often.
Soler, ruiz,vitinha,sanches,veratti…. That midfield dept is crazy
Messi ❤️❤️🔥🙏
I miss the french commentaries, but the ligue 1 is french not english
Mbappe Arrogance and selfishness towards Messi is becoming so open which is very bad
Mark my words psg is not going to win the ucl with this play especially mbappe. He should learn some basics of football. Why psg renewed his contract? Totally useless. He really lack football intelligence. I think either coach or his teammates should tell him that team comes first only then individual honours.
Verrati.. Top notch
Messi should leave psg to barca, players don't give any importance to him, he is just shadowing the Mbappe...
Ramos playing? wow
Neymar 🔥
just give the ball to messi he’ll do the rest🫡🫰 n neymar is simply on 🔥🔥🔥lets not forget what verrati does🫡🫡
I love a lot psg ❤️❤️❤️❤️ love from india 🇮🇳
I love psg just because neymar and messi here
Mpape is Selfish man 😡
Messi is there for anyone but nobody want to assit Messi whenever he is free inside the box. He is so humble
Selfishbappe, 2 times he had messi open but chose to shot and messi, while messi who could have shot, gave ball to selfishbappe
Amazing
Without Messi PSG is nothing
Same as last season, messi was playing like a goat as usual, but people only see goals
Mbappe never passes to Messi  Which is getting annoying
Messi 🤩
With Mbappe doing what he does in this team, I don't sincerely see PSG doing well in UCL. How can this little boy be this selfish. Just observe haaland's way of playing. He doses out the ball as he should and scores only when it's a must goal.
juara
Liga 1 Indonesia🤓🤓
Mbappe is the biggest selfish player I have every seen after CR7.. If you guys watched the full match you guys will know .There were so many chances during the matches where if he had passed the ball to the player who was in better position to score,they would scored 4/5 goals more .I mean Messi would have easily gotten 2 goals if that selfish turtle would have passed the ball to him .🤬
but surely mpabbe z selfish...
White shorts do not look good on this Jersey
Messi is the GOAT
It's the goalkeeper or messi missed some goals?
Messi x veratti not bad🙂
you have to feel sorry for Navas, he was playing so good and got replaced by Thibaut, then left for PSG, was so good and just because Donna have more status, he got replaced again, Navas is easily top 10 GK in the world right now
Mbappe took so many unnecessary shots, which if he gave to messi he would easily score
Honestly i think Mbappe hasn't know how Messi plays Football
Mbappe myren🤢
Messi double assist
Mbappe missing a lot of chance like an amaeture player
What the fk is wrong with Mbappe? Messi is always looking for him and Neymar to assist unselfishly but look at him! When he gets the ball always trying useless dribblings(his dribbling and runs are not impressive for me coz i don't expect outcomes form him like what's he gonna do shoot or create or smthing like that when he is carrying the ball) and shoots by himself not thinking about leo messi beside him. Do not tell me that you are blaming him without watching the match just with highlights. No. I watched the whole match last night. In my country, the show time is 1:30 AM. You know what i don't fking care you accept this or not but one thing that you should know is messi fans are watching psg matches becoz leo messi is playing. Just to remind that you are not that important Mbappe. You score goals I don't care. Last night as soon as messi got subbed, i turned off the tv and went to sleep immediately. I didn't mean that you have to always give the ball to messi, but when it is in the situations like messi has better chances you have to give him without being selfish asshole. I wish you leave the club. You don't deserve playing with leo messi.
Mpape egoisssss... Messi 👍
support koro vai plz🥰❣️
The Ninja Turtle is fucking SELFISH!!
Mbappe is just like Penaldo because they are Europens(none complete players)... Messi and Neymar are south americans(complete players)
The best Messi above average
Messi is now an attacking midfielder
King of assist MESSI👍
Neymar  messi the leggend
The greatest footballer of all time 🔥🇦🇷🐐
Farmers
Farmers
Messi tryna teach them a lesson but who's learning 😏
With all due respect, mbappe is great but he such selfish and he only thinks about himself, he shouldve passes to his teammates in more than one occasion which they were positioned better than him,
Neymar is on 🔥🔥
Neymar is king
Mbappe is so selfishhhh
Open chance for messi but mbappe wont pass.  Such a shit player selfishness at its peak.
Pochettino was barely winning matches with one goal difference lmao
Mbappe selfish player never passes the ball try to dribble or shoot only cares for his personal stat 🖕
Neymar and Mbappe keep learning from the maestro. Also don't forget to reciprocate something in return. Infant Mbappe don't be so selfish.
Mbappe the most selfish player ever , hi is worst the penaldo . He only wants to score goal , he gets 20 chances,and scores 1 or2 goals . He has to learn how to pass the ball if he wants to be 30%like Messi …. Messi total different level.😂
Babpe is too selfish
Mbappe is fire!!!
I hate mbappe only bcuz of his selfishness
Mbappe should link up play more in the box but no he wants to bo on the scoresheet alone.
I feel like mbappe doesn’t wanna let messi to break Ronaldo’s record 😂😂 now I can guarantee this psg squad ain’t winning ucl with mbappe
Look how selfish is mbappe he clearly not passing
Selfis mbappe
Messi has scored so many goals in his career that I sometimes forget that he is a genuine number 10.
Still no goal for MESSI🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Messi and goal posts, Neymar on a roll
0:55 Mbappe should have passed to Messi here, he is clearly in scoring position.
If psg sold Mbappe it would have been the best decision for them for the club .With this kind of a player in the field no team gonna get anything .Luckly Real Madrid escaped from him .
haaland would have a hattrick from mbappes chances. just saying...
Please bench mbappe
If psg continues playing like this I don't see them beating the top European clubs, it's a nice victory yes but they need to work more as a team if mbappe once in a while look for the open man like Messi's first assist psg would be deadly
Messi un maestro
Only for Messi fuck psg
Psg will lose UCL because of Mbappe
Boss messi
Football is way easy in this league, look at PSG team , they are just invincible in the League 1 .
neymar❤️💜😍
Messi would have another 5-6 goals if it wasn’t for mbappe being so greedy this season
Mbappe getting to greedy
Messi's passing⚡️💥
Messi killing everyone with his passes
Okay, why no one mentions one of the best midfielders in the world, playing for PSG. Veratti. So underrated.
this team won't do good in CL till selfish turtle is playing selfish all the time
What are they proud of? Getting knocked out in R16 in UCL?
Paris plays a lot better with Vitinha.
Messi plays better than anyone else in team, still can’t find goal for himself. Unlucky and what a goal it would had been than freekick.
farmers league  Farmers team, No UCL🤣
Mbappe siempre destruyendo
2nd loss in a row for toulouse........ maybe thats why they call them 2 lose
Shitbappe playing with his ego. Never in this match i could see him passing the ball to messi or anyone inside the box
Mbappe wants to study many thing from Goat..
Ballon d'or loading
Farmers who care
Mbappé je t’adore mais pas ce soir 😂
Messi is the most unselfish player in the history of football 🙏
Farmer League.
Football is not about goals its about playmaking iykyk 🤡
Messi will makes Neymar as the best player in the world and get his ballon d'Or. Only one player who will gonna stop them, Mbappe. 😄
L commentary
9 goals in 5 matches with double hat trick. 🔥🔥🔥🔥 see u in 🆑
we can see selfish Mbappe, PSG should sell him.
Ofcourse Messi is not on the scoresheet thanks to FuckBappe.
Neymar gonna win WC this year 😎🇧🇷❤️❤️
Mbappé Je t’adore mais pa ce soir >> Mbappé I adore you but not tonight 😂😂😂
So boring hoaaamsss😴
Messi 🔥🔥🔥
Fuerza téfécé 💪🇺🇾💜
Neymar is the best 👌 !
Mbappe should learn from Messi how to assist . 😎😎😎
Neymar 🔥
Messi is good assister 😊
Vamos Messi 💙🤍🇦🇷
Mbappe = selfishness ultra pro max.... Scored one goal... But missed how many🙂
Messi making players to score
I watched the whole match each and every second and I am damn sure Mbappe only cares about his personal stats...this lad doesn't pass to Messi and other player ....rather he prefers to shoot or tries to dribble 2 players and does not succeed.....I don't think psg can wil UCL like this with Mbappe's mindset🙄
How normal people see Toulouse: A city How I see Toulouse: Rugby Club
mbappe selfish 🍌
메시이겨라이겨라이겨라
I'm seeing a bran new Neymar under this new coach
Messi is rosing.
Poor And Selfish Mbappe
Neymar 🔥
Neymar ki up
Just scoring goals doesn't mean nothing if there is no play making and assist. And tbh mbappe is the worst self egotistical player in the history of football. Psg can score more and dominate the game with the likes of players they possess rn. But since that boy wanna be the only scorer psg will never win the champions league again.
Neymar, Messi 💥👌
💥💥💥👌
The selfish turtle is hurting the team.
Naymer you beauty
PSG ❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
Messi is frustrated but a great proffesional  he was so pissed of and but did not react Just kept on delivering 👌 👏
If mbappe was in messi place he wud have gone for the goal kick.
Mbappe is never change his altitude.Learn from messi who know situation of chance which is higher.
Verrati best passes
Selfish alien 👽 mbaape
Messi tu es le meilleur joueur di monde
Ngl, in situations just like the second goal where messi passed into the box, Mbappe shot and missed. If he had cut back, this game wd have been over waaay earlier.
Mbappe finishing still horrible, bro really need ro work on that, he misses too much !
If there wasn't neymar and parades and sometimes nuno no one passes the ball to messi for a shot
Neymar 💥💥🔥🔥❤️❤️😘❤️❤️
Neymar 💥💥🔥🔥❤️❤️😘❤️❤️
Neymar 💥💥🔥🔥❤️❤️😘❤️❤️
Selfishness 😭
I love seeing MESSI and NEYMAR in this form
Neymar Jr is the best ❤️🔥
Stadium er light er alo kom🐸
Ffs bro if you keep mbappe in the team messi isnt going to score... i havent seen any player obstruct another as bad as this, useless turtle
Neymar is Boss ad Boss always remains Boss♥
Messi The Little Magician 💥💥
Messi 2 more assists. He was the stand out player again, GOAT
Mbappe misses way too much, twice in front of the goalie 1vs1 and he missed it. Run less score more .
Boring league
If messi could only break those spells and start back scoring free kicks I believe he will flow again then he could feed M and N and still have 30 to 35 goals but those spells boi stups it is not normal 😱
Mbappe 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Messi
Messi is not selfish and giving assist
Rumour has it that Messi is still waiting for Mbappe to pass him the ball    .
Without a perfect defensive midfielder you can’t win champions league. They should have bought Casemiro.
Neymar❣️🔥
Messi love me
Mbappe is stopping the linkup between messi and neymar
Neymar now🔥⚡️☄️
This mbappe so selfish player , he can 2time pass to messi really big ego
Messi gets clowned for not scoring but look how he’s playing
Debemos ver el nivel del PSG en champions. La liga Francesa es muy dispareja y de bajo nivel.  A ver qué pasa pronto .
ПСЖ с победой!
Mppabe is selfish
lets celebrate this win to this song https://youtu.be/Ed8hioNWMM4
Fuck mabapha
Ya la andava cajeteando el sergio ramos
Messi was for me too way better ✌️
Vitinha is the keyplayer for PSG
1:01 메시 패스 보소 ㄷㄷ
That’s how you assist and pass the ball back, to the rest of the psg players. Messi by himself a lot.
where number one where number one where number one go messi go team go psg go team go messi go psg go
Neymar on a roll
Mbappe still selfish
Neymar
Te amo Neymar
Also make no mistake. The original Ronaldo and cristiano Ronaldo both on their prime most probably will score 1:1 vs goalkeeper. Mbappe has had many 1:1s and lost so many to them. This is the difference between a world class striker and someone who's extremely overrated. Again, Messi orchestrated the team to score.  On a second note, the opponent goalkeeper proved he's on 🔥 fire. Needs to play for a bigger team.
At least they didn’t lose by 5
Hope you people realize messi drives this team. It's unfortunate the goalie stopped his shots but he's on fire sooner or later he'll score nonstop as well
Messi & Neymar 🔥❤️
Sera cierto que les pagan por aplaudir a la afición?
People only see and talk about who scored the most goals, but just look at Leo's assists here, he is unstoppable this season!
Messi 🔥
Neymar and Messi bossing the game?💪💪💪💪💪
🇩🇿🇩🇿
Who was man of the match?
Neymar is just on another level this season🔥🔥
This is Messi’s season 👀
Messi siempre será el mejor!🔥
Neymar has been soo good this season
Neymar 🤙🏾
Messi untouchable
