10 out of 10
butifull song
Beautiful song with a very true message. Live this day, tomorrow will come with it's own problems. That's paraphrased from the Bible. I'm nearly 70 and I was in my 50s before I realized the constant push, push, push for more left nothing but wanting. We can work for a future, but use today as today, not tomorrow. I've never felt more at peace. 😊😊👋👋❤❤

@cyn-elliot
“Passion gives rise to emotion; emotion opens the door to spiritual growth. In growth, we discover our shared humanity — a truth that binds both you and me. As the Beatles once sang, let it be — a quiet wisdom in a noisy world.” x🔽🏳‍🌈💋love your lyrics i maybe...
❤❤❤
I commented on this a while back. Still stays.the same . A GF or Wife is always looking for the bigger better. The last man standing isn't going to be the one that loves her cause he's tired of her shit. She wants the hole filled.  That's all!
I love it 🤩

your beautiful songs ❤wow 😮😊
Nice song.  A man may be the tallest standing,  but women will knee cap him for the" Guy Bestie" and their "Comorker" every time. Boyfriends and husbands are for the money and stability. Not the excitement women want, when they don't bring the same. Just drama.
From Ruth , Love this song and love ❤️ you. 🥰

Hay I work on a cruise as a performer and I was wondering if we could use your songs for are memorial day show because on that day we have a lot of veterans and military connected children. Please reach out by responding to this comment if it is OK. If not we understand we will find new songs. I am asking because we have to and don't know if it will be put on social media and that stuff.
This is love not war hit me so deep 😢
Nice  song❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂
This song is so gorgeous that every time I listen to it I feel like its the first time discovering its beauty.
I lost my day two years ago........ with lung cancer at the age of 73 years old  ,,,,,😢 he was more than my father he was my hero,   he won't be missed l just look in the mirror and he's with me every day in my eyes and hart . Good  song happy days ❤❤

Who's here in 2025 🎉❤
👋 😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
I will like it today
2025?
Honestly, my heart is with this man. I pray Jesus protects through all the darkness in this plaqued world. You have no idea how much my heart yarns for your protection. I pray I can see you in the heavens because you have no idea how much you have impacted me spiritually. You will never know who I am, but I truly pray for your protection and to find the love of your life. It's silly for me, but I truly feel every word you write down. You express my heart like no one else. It's also silly for me to think you are something for me, but remember, there're God fearing sous that understand your music and what you are trying to share. Please continue being you, I don't listen to anyone on the level I listen to you. You make my heart cry out for God in ways I did t think I would. Seriously, I hope you get my message because you are the only person I truly take heart to your lyrics. If i can meet you in person, that would be beyond a dream. Please continue to show who you really are and stay firm on it! I believe in you more than you think. God bless and protect every step you take. You are grounding my spirit. Amen!!! -Chasity  Please don't stop being you. I truly feel like you are a person to be in my life.

I'm in love with this song it reminds me not to end it when everything is so hard for me rn❤
❤️
From Italy: Non so come fai, ma ogni tua canzone sembra una poesia ed è pura medicina per il cuore. Ti ho conosciuto 4 anni fa tramite un video su YouTube, dove cantavi delle cover della durata di due  minuti, la tua voce era fuoco, energia pura, si sentiva la tua anima attraverso le note che riuscivi a raggiungere. Guardati ora, sei letteralmente una leggenda, il tuo fisico è cambiato, ti sei dato molto da fare per perfezionarti. Riscoprirti dopo 4 anni e vedere ciò che sei diventato mi ha emozionato, sul serio, continua così, grazie per avermi riacceso l'anima.

I discovered Livingston on Instagram. This song speaks so gently to my heart that I share with my Partner.  I went and saw Livingston in Camden this year with him and my best friend. I've never felt so deeply about a song and the connection it has with me. I love this song. It seems to speak perfectly for myself and my Partner. We intend on getting married and I will make sure this is one song at the top of the playlist <3

So tell me what you’re looking for, and you said… i don’t need a sympathy.

Nice❤
I love this!!!!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
lol nice bro
Nice job Livingston!!! congtratess!!!
Weird thoughts at night episode "whatever" I've seen and I've loved many great artists whose music initially was magical but then they became famous and "for me" the soul of their music stopped existing but then again many exceptional artists didn't get the recognition they deserved and thus I find myself thinking maybe just maybe what is good for people might not be good for the art 🎭 If anyone made it to the end Please forgive me for my weirdness
You are the best

One thing I love is the way the world works out and it’s so much easier when we are together and we are able to talk and communicate with people in a respectful manner without having a lot of pressure to talk and be honest with them because we are so happy and we can talk about things like this ❤❤❤❤😂🎉😢😢😊😊😊
I like this song

And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for  I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

Me and my ex stopped talking a few months ago and she was very important to me and I wish everyday she would message me but I know she is on a different journey.
0:16 is the best part. Great song Livingston. I love listening to it. 😊

My. Name. Is. Sawyer. Can. You send me a homemade video
I don't want to do a minute but I love you and your music of course music of course
Note your the best ur voice is perfect I knew you since sand castle came btw
It's a haunting Melody with an upbeat feeling of love. This artist is one of my favorites. I love how transparent he is, really just his entire being is incredible.
Fave song, hands down. I wanna collaborate so bad lol
I love everything you put out thank u so much. I lost my husband recently and your music has helped me  start to let go and find my new path
What is it about this song that has me listening to it non stop? I am obsessed with it right now. I love how it says i want you and nothing else. I think thats it. As a person who is realizing she doesnt know who she is and is now working to discover it......this song found me at the right time. My favorite line is "you dont have to fight so hard this is love not war" as far as self love its felt like a war for a long time. Now its time to lay down the weapons and love me for me ❤
Seriously the two together is magic! That voice of Jelly with that bit of raspiness, is sexy AF!
What a beautiful song. Thank you.❤
Love this song and in my favourite list Salute you champ 🎉 🇵🇬

I love this song. I hit home for me because when I was little I was diagnosed with a Developmental Delay and then when I was 18 years old I became mentally ill because of trauma. My finance left this world about a year and a half ago and he was that last man standing to me. We were together for 15 years. He proposed and he was my everything.

How’s in 2026🎉
1st time hearing the entire song.  So beautiful, hunny.  I am excited for your future.  I have a son with ADHD.  His life sadly has not turned out well.  He is 30 now.  I think that is why I am so happy for you.   I don't often comment because I am sure you won't see this, but I hope you do.💜💜💜
Love this song I gave all of y’all likes so can y’all give me likes?
My fiancé showed me this song after I gave birth to our daughter last January. Every time he played it I cried. It was one of our happiest times of our lives. I was in the hospital for 5-6 days bc my Bp wouldn’t go down he never left my side.
2025. This song is too good
Nothing can stop you from having the best sangs and especially the best voice
Wow I love this song and yes perfect for wedding ❤
Beautiful.
His  songs I just love he is one of  my favorite artists

...the words I could never find
I wish I could meet him it is my dream but it won’t happen ever I don’t have any money
Y'know what, this guy might make me less emo
This guy gives me Lukas graham vibes
Love his voice listening to every song. His music speaks to me in a way I have never felt before.❤❤
I'm in tears right now, this describes the relationship between my fiance and I. I've been around the world and right now we're going through the K1 immigration process and your lyrics hit hard young man. When we get married this year, this song will be the most important one played, thank you for gracing us with this beautiful song.
Man this song hit me randomly.  Little over a year ago.  Splendifourious. The musical note after i just want to know when your landing. My head screams please.  Perfect. I wish she wanted the last man standing.
Don't ya love this song? Sam likes to sing it with me ❤

May be a song in this song weaver  >Livingston
Just posted this and thought your audience might benefit... TY Remember to Live in Love... Share face-red-heart-shape So it's easy for Me to say I Love you as I Love myself... I Live in Love... grow my Heart... so there is room for Others Souls Love can pour in... fill my cup... I raise it to the Most High... thank you my FAMILY. The Most High made us in his image each unique and complete Soul... then sent us out to experience multiple lifetimes so we can eventually see our true selves - we are each other >one< within learning this as we integrate each others frequencies - like we are all made in The Most Highs image a singularity (ALL)  Together all of us make one complete entity - all our Souls... fractals with our own experiences so we need to learn from each other so we become the puzzle piece.
I luv you your awesome, I'd stand by you
Here in 2025 ➡️

This song was played at my girlfriends funeral. My girlfriend died of Cancer. She was fighting for 5 years and it was stressful for us. I had the privilege to sing this at her funeral. Thank you Livingston. This song makes me cry every time
Hey man, your music is great! Please stay true to morals and decency and fight falling into the big music industry. Your art will reflect it, and you will certainly succeed without falling to their depravity.  Keep it up!

Livingston Last man standing is what?Thinking about i got? 🍻😇😀
...I reconnected with a very special man after 37 years. He sent this to me. I'd never heard this song before but when I listened to it,my heart just flooded with so many emotions and I was in tears. Truly this is one of the most beautiful,  most moving songs I have ever heard. Thank you. Your voice & talent are a blessing to all that hear it. To my Alpha you are my last man standing.
My dad died and he loved this song so he told me to listen to it every day but he is in a better place and soon I be there with him
I Love your voice 😍😍😍

Millie from Chandler AZ
Just amazing ❤❤❤
I love this music a lot
Wow this song still brings back so many memories! I'm turning 33 this year and this was actually mine and my husband's wedding song that was also played when we got married. He was a few years older than me and we had been in love for years but neither he nor I dared say anything about it to each other. But one day when we had found the religion Baha'i I decided to tell him how i felt and he told me that he felt the same about me so we decided to get married. But tragically, he died just 3 weeks later from Epilepsy, which I also have, but a significantly worse Epilepsy than he had, so I will probably have like 10 years left or so to live max if I stay here in my home country, where I live and was born . Here, unfortunately, I cannot get the right medicine for my disease and the oldest person in this country where i live that had this disease was tragically only 53 years old, so if you also count me, there are now only 2 people in my country with this epilepsydisease and about 1000 people in the whole world as far as we know. But you can avoid epileptic attacks completely with the help of a plant! And yes, it's green, and you'll probably understand which plant I'm referring to! But it is unfortunately illegal even as medicine in "my modern home country". But the oldest person in the whole world with this disease lived to be 86 years old as far as is known because it had the right to use this amazing plant. But i use it anyway because i told my husband long before he died that i would never die from Epilepsy or any other disease!   But thanks to our religion that we found and this song text i now know that if i would die from Epilepsy or any other thing i will meet him up there above.  So thank you for this wonderful song! Brings me so much love! ❤❤❤

I hated your music at first, but after some things happened in my life I turned to you for support! I love you and everything you stand for brother! One of the best artists of my generation! I’m a father of 2 and I struggle with crippling depression, my last girlfriend I tried to have left me back in April after showing me this song so I come back to it for rejoicing rather than being sad. Thank you so much Livingston, for your music and for your soul being here in these songs!❤
One of the best songs

Kedves LIVINGSTON Amikor először hallottam, láttam ezt a dalod, arra gondoltam:HÉ KI EZ A SRÁC A FAÁGON?! ANNYIRA MEGÉRINTETT A DALOD, hogy nem hagyott nyugodni. Attól a perctől a rajongód lettem. Zürichben látlak élőben! ;) Nagyon várom
God bless you!! Talent!!

Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I would follow this artist closely, he is ultra talented, he speaks to my soul.❤
Your music gives me goose bumps. I'm not sure if I'm the only one but when I hear someone sing that's outstanding that's what it does to me. Like I'm feeling it in my body.
Whos here 2080

Since he wants the last man standing. Is this song meant for a man 😂. He's gay right lol. Nothing wrong with that it's just funny. Because I'm singing along to this song. Looking at my girl and then it hit me. He's singing about a dude lol
I have always followed this song on Instagram before you dropped the song on all platforms.   I really love the melody and the lyrics
Livingston is my favorite artist

Music❤❤❤❤❤
My son in law has lost both his parents this year to cancer. His dad just days ago.  My daughter loves him so much and her and I planned their wedding within 7 weeks so both his parents could be there.  This song is so appropriate,  he needs all the strength and support at this awful time.  I would like to think this song reinforces the love and support he has and that all is not lost.  He has a family that love him very much.
I hope you are so proud of yourself!! I'm a big fan of you, you are awesome. I'm 30 years old, single mother of two children, my son has autism and is forever 3 years old (in real he is 13).  If I ever get married I would play your song.
This is actually one of my more favorite songs recently and I ended up finding it because of the video where he sang to the little girl in the wheelchair.
You have an amazing voice and I now follow you
Yes!!! Love this guy ❤❤❤ THANK you for your beautiful music
Damn your music hits different on some good headphones jus got some new JBLs
Me

Beautiful song. 🙂

Lyrics   [Verse 1] I've been around the world, seven wonders, seven seas But when all is said and done, you're only thing I see, my love So tell me what you're lookin' for You're written in the stories, a livin' masterpiece So when all is said and done, why you standin' next to me, my love? So tell me what you're lookin' for And you said  [Chorus] I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop sellin' me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just wanna know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Causе I just want the last man standing  [Verse 2] I've been around the world, livеd a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done, you're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're lookin' for 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darlin', this is love, not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been lookin' for  [Chorus] I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop sellin' me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just wanna know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  [Bridge] And you said, "I just want the last man standing, now" And you said, "I just want the last man standing"  [Chorus] Oh, I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop sellin' me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just wanna know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

When your talented enough all on your own to record a full music video sitting on a tree branch. Dope
Makes sense why this is the most popular song in this channel
Love when he sings last man standing ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊
I like you song bro🎉💪👍
I'm so happy to be able to listen to this incredibly talented and incredibly handsome young man 💯💯💯💯
this song is in my top 5 favorite songs. I know all the words. Thankyou for writing this song Livingston. you have such a beautiful voice.💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
You are amazing You Have a Passion for music let it be seen ans heard
Why do all his videos look like they were shot with a camcorder held by his buddy from high school? Great songs, but his videos ruin them. I liked him more before I saw his videos. Ugh.
One of best songs😄
Please don't loose this form of music, when you can draw tears with a simple lyric that wraps around my heart, you've found something truly special. Remember, your life is a result of your choices and I wish you God's guidance in making those choices. much respect 😁
🖤
WOW!!!
SO YOUNG!  CLASS ACT!  PURE TALENT! REFRESHING! LOVE YOU LIVINGSTON!
❤"Beautiful song Livingston.  Great job!
I love this song
I love watching Livingston become more popular. I’ve loved him since I first heard him.
My favorite one is 1 foot in a row 1 foot in a dream. Don’t dare make a sound here from a mile away run from the town all you needed your name.
this goes so hard
I'm crying 😭😭😭
Namaste 😊
I Love Your voice
Beautiful lyrics! ✅ Very healing. ❤️‍🩹
I love his voice
I wish I could know this guy, and his heart!  This song touched my heart in ways i didn't know i could still feel. Not all women are impressed by money and material things. Some of us are old fashioned and love their spouse for who they are, not what they can give you. Luckily,  i found a wonderful man and this song makes me appreciate him even more than I already did, if that was even possible! Thank you Livingston for your original sound and the most amazing music and lyrics I've heard. I wish nothing but the best for you in your future and hope that you NEVER change your music or your heart!! It's obvious that you put everything you feel into you music, because others feel it as it comes through it!!
Finding Peace in you own soul 🫶

This song is my favorite song ever and my siblings love it and my mom always makes fun songs about you guys 😊😊😊😊😊❤😊❤❤😊❤😊❤😊❤
Goodness is there any song you don’t rock? I love your amazing vocabulary and your way of painting a story for us and making us all feel every emotion you convey in your lyrics! Funny story my husband and I we’re running into town the other day and he had his playlist on and your song Last Man standing came on! I had sent it to him when it first came out and he downloaded it an your other ones! Fans for life! You always keep us on our toes when you drop a new song we are amazed at the range of genres! You mom did a good job 👍 I know she is a big part of your inspiration. Hopefully when you come near us we will have the privilege to hear you live! Let me know if you have merch yet!

Can I call you because I’m a really really big fan
it made my daughter cry and she sings it every day
OMG!! I learned a dance to this song in my old dance class and we performed in front of my ENTIRE school as one of the last things I did in primary school…. Memories😢❤️‍🩹 0:15 ❤️‍🩹😭
im 22 years old i have the chills and all i can think about is me and my fiancé we been together i want him to sing that song at my wedding!!!
Humanity awaken. Here we go
Truly amazing - I am mesmerized by his voice and the poetic words in this song.
hey man, im 17 and there's this girl at my church and i have a crush on her and im telling her on sunday the 20th and uhm she hasn't heard music other than the ones at church and i think this is one of the first ones i'll show her
This man has a big heart  That's why i feel so blessed listening his voice
My favorite song ❤❤❤
Yo honestly your songs are becoming better to the point that I've followed, pressed the notification bell and started to listen to you again ................................. Ay keep it up
Thanks jadeyybabyy ❤

A beautiful singing man
Love this song!!! Compared to the acoustic version your voice is more echoed here, keep it real man and keep it crisp. you have an amazing voice and you (not maybe) WILL go far with your given talent. 10/10
I am 8 years old and you have brought happiness to my life keep it up and I sing even though I am 8 years old and I still sing. And I left philippines and I went to Saudi Arabia and I was sad until your song brought me happiness keep it up and thank you for bringing happiness to me it means a lot thank you
WOW!!!
From Portugal! Congratulations! Amazing songs, nice rhythm, great vocal delivery... fantastic! I believe we’ll have a number 1 hit very soon.
Keep doing what you do best!!! We are still here and you keep surprising myself and my husband allbthe time. Love you and your music..Seriously now. Does anyone even read anything before they type??? Go back to where he began before you make comments.😢 Its sad to think that so many people can be so obviously not really here for him. Your comments  show how superficial you jokers are. If you truly support and love his music then gobto his beginning before making comments. He left a major label a year ago.
It's insane that you would ask anyone's permission to use any song for your first dance. As a friendly FYI not too long ago he posted saying who would play this at their wedding,  my husband and I renewed our vows using this song as the one playing while I walked down the isle.  It's one of our favorites ❤   And congratulations on your nuptials next year ❤
You need to wash that crap off your hand.
The only way to know you is to love you anyone
I love you so much and you are my everything and everything and you know that you are loved by me 😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤
this guy takes all my pain away when he sings its almost like home filled with peace
like this if i should send this to my crush
Your songs are good enough for the radio, great job
My son loves this song he’s gonna sing it for his talent show.🎤
This could have not found me in the best of times. My ex's never knew me at all.
God...I get full body goosebumps when I hear this beautiful voice!!! He is a voice of a generation for real!
I love this song it makes me thing of my dog that died😢
My daughters found you somehow. They are 9 and 12 and obsessed. We’re surprising them with tickets to the Tampa show in a few weeks. If you see 2 little girls singing every song at the top of their lungs, that’s us!
How do you sing it so fast and good
How do you think it's so fast and good
I love this song, but the video is not great. The song is about the person wanting the "last man Standing"! You are sitting through the entire video. When I picture the video for this, I see you standing on a cliff over the ocean or something like that. Standing & singing this into the wind!  Please redo this video. Standing!😉🥰
I'm so impressed with you, young man. This song actually encompasses everything I am experiencing right now and I'm grateful to hear my story.  Good job fighting through the challenges you've had. You need to be commended.
Can someone explain what they understood from: " You don't need to be the king, coz I just want the last man standing"
Me and  my family love you’re songs we love you
This isn’t king Nasir song:(
When we enter our cave we discover an eternal flame that ignites our passions. It is incredibly rare i find anyone within the entertainment industry that still has their authenticity, as leaving this cave we open ourselves up to sharing that spark that ignites our meaning, but in turn it exposes us to others energy. If a crowds energy is able to penetrate the armor of the artists, the artist will quickly diminish their own light and start expressing the crowds energy which is the artist as the idol and not the eternal flame. I see you. I pray your armor never fails for there is a storm approaching you. You have the strength within. Like when 'Trouble' comes looking for Elvis Presley just use his line "I got a date" and walk out that door.
Here is the next "Mick Jagger"
35 year old female (not that its relevant, just like to paint a whole page) and I have never been touched so much by a melody. I can't even follow the words to this song, well apart from the chorus (I think). Its just beautiful and makes me rhink of the sand
Love this song 🩷💯🫂🩵🙏
This is beautiful. This young man has innate talent and a beautiful voice.
💜💜💜💜💜💜
I want to know if I can have your number send
Livingston I love you so much

This sucks
Hey there I’m Kev I came across your channel in my feed and I just have to say that you amazed me! My channel is also a music channel, I create my music on my 12 string acoustic. I’m not the best lyricist or sing so most of my music are instrumentals but if you look there and hear anything that strikes you and inspires lyrics let me know I would love to collaborate with you. My music is a different style but then I’m much older than you! Oh and I’m subscribing to your channel right know. Have a look at mine I’d love your opinion! 🎼🎵🎶🎸👍🏻🤩

You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why you standing next to me, my love? So tell me what you're looking for? And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

This is how I feel for my husband. You are truly an amazing young man with a very amazing voice. Thank you plz keep the songs coming..
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤ l
I like some of your other songs (Shadow and Gravedigger) but I feel this one is extremely lacking. It feels like you gave up writing the chorus and used AI to write the rest of it for you. The first half of the chorus sounds okay, but the rest of it doesn't make sense
I found this recently and when I looked at his channel I was so surprised he was the same guy from 4 years ago when he released fairytale
Meeeeeeeeeeee❤❤❤❤
i am a hueg fan
this reminds me of colin and Rachel cos they always listen to this
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Biblical!
I used to be so mad about this song out but now that it’s out I’m happy 😊😊
Je viens de donner ce lien à un ré actionneur Français...Tu mérites tellement et tu fais tant de Bien à ceux qui t'écoutent . Que le Meilleur Soit pour Toi 🙏❤
Sooooo talented.     I’m a 51 year old Metalhead here.    This kid blows my mind.    Chicago Keith

Introduced to this artist by my 11 year old ,hes fab, i introduced her to 30 seconds to mars ,she said they sound similar....sharing our music tastes ❤
This is my favourite song right now
When I’m older I will definitely remember this song and use it in my wedding
Only thing I see is my mum because she is the best...
My granddaughter is doing her dance solo to this song this year ❤️
Why?
Yo who thinks he should go to AGT/Americans Got Talent  👇
I love this song
Just saw this on YouTube short
Hello~ I don't know if this will be seen here or if the next thing I'm going to comment on is part of a game on their part. I just wanted to warn you that on TikTok they are asking for money in your name.
This has been one of my favorite Livingston songs since hearing it for the first time a few months ago. ❤ Shared it with my sister who didn't understand the message so to anyone else who might not get it at first, here's what it means to me:  I've traveled lots of places and seen so many things from them, but after being everywhere, they all pale in comparison to seeing you.  So tell me, how can I be who you are looking for?  You're too good to be true, too perfect to be real, so when you see how flawed I am by comparison, why of all people are you with me?  So tell me, how can I be who you are looking for?  Then you said, "I don't need you to impress me by going above and beyond. I just want you because you're already special to me.  I don't need you to buy me pretty things. I already know that you love me. Stop thinking money can buy love.  I don't need you to sacrifice the hobbies that bring you joy or let me keep you from living your life. I just want to know when I'll see you again (especially if one travels for work or needs to spend a lot of time working on a project, this is especially meaningful).  You don't need to be powerful, wealthy, or popular. I just want the man that never left."  I've gotten to do a lot of things I've always wanted to do, but after getting to be everything, if I had to choose, I'd rather be with you.  (Even though he doesn't say it, I believe he switches to the woman's perspective since he changes from saying 'love' to 'darling') "you don't have to fight so hard to win me over. There isn't a battle for my affection because I already love you. All I want is who you are. You are who I've been looking for.  "I don't need you to impress me by going above and beyond. I just want you because you're already special to me.  I don't need you to buy me pretty things. I already know that you love me. Stop thinking money can buy love.  I don't need you to sacrifice the hobbies that bring you joy or let me keep you from living your life. I just want to know when I'll see you again.  You don't need to be powerful, wealthy, or popular. I just want the man that never left."        I hope this clears some minds changes some hearts out there listening.😊

Боже! Как это прекрасно...🥰😍❤
Magnifique ✌️😊
such a beautiful song love it 🤩
This song would make the perfect duet song 😊
Incredible❤ Thank you. Its all about my story
Hihi auf dem Baumstamm
I love watching you sing.  You move your hands as if you can see the entire story and every note dancing in front of you like you reading the invisible beautifully orchestrated expression of love that the lyrics bring to life.  Notes, both high and low, your fingers trace them in the air.  And watching you play this for your dad, how you looked like you were so expressive with your hands like you were almost  wanting to interpret the sheer magnitude of the heat of the message of the song..like a gift that you want someone to truly grasp and feel and receive and be blessed by. I don’t think I have ever commented in a YouTube video before, but you are a special you man with a gift and I pray that this gift of yours brings added blessings but adds little sorrow.  Looking forward to a lifetime of music from you!
I am so grateful for this young man.  Such a unique voice and clearly talented song writer and apparently producer.   So smart to go it on your own.  Stick to your own plan because I believe you have an incredibly bright future.   I've just turned 66 the end of May but you are my new favorite artist!
Celebrate him❤
♥♥♥ Amazing
Where has this guy been ?
This song reminds me so much of my ex who passed away. Who never cared if I had money just wanted my love. Passed away a 2yrs ago in October
Вкусно😍😋🔥
I would love for someone to sing this to me.
He's like Dan Reynolds🎶🎶☺️
I am 55years old and I am crying you just said everything that i have been saying for years to my husband , I just wish he could be hear now to hear it from this beautiful song . Thank you
I’m getting married September 21 2024 and this is gunna be are fist dance song I literally just found this song like a week ago and I told my fiance how bout this song and she’s like yes I love it can’t wait to play this song for everyone to hear it
i absolutely love this song its amazing and i listen to it every chance i get
I love you so much for this. Seriously, thank you ❤️‍🩹♥️
It takes a True Artist to turn So Much Pain Into Such Meaningful Music...You Touch the Soul of Everyone Fortunate Enough to Hear It.
There was this video on tik tok of him holding a sign for those to sit with anxiety.  This guy puts on these headphones and Jon starts the piano and I'm like oh catchy then he starts singing and the way he changes his voice I became a instant fan.  I love how his body is in tuned with the music it's like he becomes the rythem.  I have a few of his songs from youtube music but so far Shadow is my favorite.
Fuk
You are a real artist, beautiful done, congrats man you are gonna be bigger than what you already are

Please don't desire money and become a mainstream artist it will destroy your voice and message, they will force you to sing music that you won't want they will destroy who you truly are. Money is the drug they give you to give up who you are. Thank you for your voice and words in a dark world you are a beacon of light.
Ok, so never heard of him until today, but WOW!!!

Top three favorite songs from Livingston shadow,last man standing and architect
Merinding 🎉
Youre my last man standing!!
The Man is very talented and has an amazing voice he has a bright future ahead of him.. Instead of signing to a corporate record company he needs to stand Solo and do it all himself make his own label..Like Ryan Upchurch and Tom McDonald!!!Great song love it..Very beautiful...
if they add on drum beat... it will totally out of this world.
Ok your belting tones and soft tones are both incredible...but my guy... that false vibrato is killing me!  I want to love this song but i can't get past that shuddering noise you do. You dont need to force it.

Back... goose bumps straight away again 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 hope your tour is Super Cool😊
I'm an epic music fan normally (TSFH, Audiomach, Jo Blank, etc) and this is the only other modern ballad artist that gives me a similar epic feel...

Last Man Standing is absolutely brilliant!! One of the best love song ballots ever written, because it connects with so many who listen. Countless goose bumps/chills, can't get enough, half a century of listening to music, and I never replayed a song as much.
The only thing on YouTube this is missing is like Button I can smash a million times Thumbs 👍
Beautiful and intense. I get Adele vibes from this song.
♥

I got married with my best friend for about 3 weeks ago that I have known since i was around 16 years old and i am soon 32 so almost half my life and both felt a very strong connection to this song. So strong that both me and he decided that it would be are official wedding song. And if youre wondering, no we are not gay. We are something that are called Metrosexual.
😢❤❤❤
You sing in cursive it’s beautiful. Headphone shivering over here 💕
Not me, but this is amazing

Лучше бы сидел и не шевелился, клип бы намного круче смотрелся. Поет восхетительно, но его движения :субтильного женоподобного  тела - просто бесят. Ты либо мужик ,либо баба!? А пейзаж в клипе здоровский.
the vibrato 😭 so good wow!
You make my fav songs

Randomly stumbled upon a YouTube short for shadow
you are my faverit  singer
Gotta love all the elderly people in his comment sections
Simple et passionné un talent magnifique
Amazing song!!
you have a great voice love this it is great to live your dream
The raspy tone of his voice is my favorite part because most singers train their vocals to avoid it. But it adds a tone of desperation as if everything in the world was lost.
I don't need a symphony🎵  I just want your voice and a melody👨‍🎤  I don't need your diamond rings💍  I just want your love stop selling me💲  I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings🕊 I just wanna know when you're landing🛬  You don't need to be the king👑  'Cause I just want the last man standing⚔
🍁🖐❤  songs of the summer 2024

Who's here because they genuinely follow him
People send me to prison Federally every year after being paid to take a bribe and falsely convict me. They do it because they hear I have abilities; this year they gave me HPV (a cancerous strain) and said I was murdering woman even with a known cure out there, a mushroom extract you put in your vagina as well as AHCC mushroom extract. I have to detail this or they will further slander my name and create a bandwagon of killers all working against me to murder me which they have done semi successfully hitting me with cigarettes and car exhaust fumes federally.  They tell me I’ve been compromised and they are going to convict everyone in any channel I utilize while I try to get help to understand what this life is while my visor and visuals are stolen.  I don’t know how I’m even alive I just get wounded constantly by invisible forces while I’m told my soulmate/life partner is out there and someone is stealing my worm to rape her and she lives in my neighborhood   If anyone can help me figure out what’s going on and why people aren’t giving me my dream states while they make falsehood accusations to murder me and rape my friends and anyone I come into contact with after stealing federal board member chairs I’d appreciate it.  -They have called me Salem but I don’t know if that’s me; when I worked Uber they called me Darth Vader. If I can’t see anything they switched out my worm with another to rape my girl. Ever since I was little I was known as Bear. Bear as in bear rune from Diablo 2 who’s etching is the karate kid in beat johnnys ass stance.   P.S: I hate the name Daniel over and out

I can't believe the feelings this young man makes me feel with his music! His song shadow really gets to me too. It's his voice, he must be descended from Angels! His voice gives me goosebumps!  He is definitely unique and I sincerely love his music!!!! I pray he don't fall into the darkness that comes with a music career. Just being himself is enough! 💕

목소리가 완전 파워풀해👍
Can I just say, your music hits deep. All of your songs. I hope you keep creating such amazing pieces. You have some incredible talent and some deep emotions. I wish I had that. I want to start my own music channel, but I just don't have what it takes. I admire you. Your music is sort of my inspiration. I love you. (Platonically.) 🫶.
KEEP your videos pure. You don't need dumb people choreographing or messing up with your image, you do not need anything but yourself and 'The One True Creator's' nature behind you in your videos, no need for gimics and props, stay as fresh in the future as you are today. A message from a fellow autist, may 'The One True Creator' keep you safe from all the evils of this messed up, world we live in.
Wow! This is beautiful! First time hearing this!❤

Good Song , Sea View Would Be Sick Listening To This .
turned your pixar lyrics from your song Fairytale into Marvel lyrics  At age of nine, I lived through Marvel in the frame   And every single struggle seemed so small, so tame   'Cause Cap could save the world even when I felt alone   The kids at school that teased me, fears I hadn't shown   Oh, I thought I was invincible   But Iron Man, his armor couldn't hold up the invincible   I built my walls, felt invisible   Thinking even Vision could still find love with no flesh and bone    So keep me awake   Just look in my eyes   I'm trying to let go   I try to forget   The fairytales lie   But it's all that I've known    I was so scared to open up that door   Worried that the world outside might hurt me more   This isn't Tony's lab, this isn't the tech I used to see   What happened to the stories, the dreams that set me free?   Then my mother asked me   Could you find confidence   Beyond Spider-Man's swings?   'Cause stories may fade once you wake from the dream   I looked her in the eyes, searching for what it could mean   If my heroes can't always win    Oh, I thought I was invincible   But Thor's mighty hammer could only hit so hard and   I built a shell, felt invisible   Hoping even Groot could still find friends with his single word    So keep me awake   Just look in my eyes   I'm trying to let go   I try to forget   The fairytales lie   But it's all that I've known    Then my mother asked me   Could you find confidence   Beyond the Hulk's rage?   'Cause stories don't last once you turn the last page   I looked her in the eyes and asked her what it all means   If my heroes can't always save the day
Can't stop the tears....Wonderful.Brilliant.
hey man!   grats on hitting it!
I love this song❤ Thanks for making beautiful song
This young man is about to blow up & I wish him all the good things he's deserves to have amazing talent.

I I'm such a big fan I love the song shadow by you I listen it ,100 times a day my mum gets anoid so I go upstairs and listen it . I wish I could come to one of your concerts but I'm English and live in England
What does it mean to be the last man standing? As in he wants to be there for the person he is singing about? I assume his girlfriend. Its a nice song even if i dont get it 😊
Beyond talented.
Ты ❤
Love this song
Unmatched talent. Unique.
I wish you could do a concert in Pittsburgh, PA. I love your music! Thank you for sharing your talent with all of us
More musical artists nowadays can be recognized because of the Internet Facebook all books lol and more quirky artists look at Billie Eiilish  she and her older brother made Oscar academy award music how cool is that and these artists were all throwing lines out there with shorts and people answered by pulling those likes wanting more and more..I just discovered Livingston and a little while back Teddy swims but now ive seen every son every video ...some folk artists Tangerine Orange for last 5 years.yup,also AI Voice the AGT and BGT and all musical shows with amazing artists out thete for world to see even if they didnt win they gained notoriety!! Angelina Jordan,Dawtry. Its  good time to be an aspiring artist if you don't give up.Jelly Roll   my gosh so many amazing talented song writers and singers
🎉🎉🎉
Its not music, its dogshit
I love this song bro

Thank you, @Livingston. My 1 yr old daughters are obsessed with this song. Literally, the only thing that calms them when everything else fails and the smile as they watch you  and try to sing and try to dance ugh, i love it. Loved the song when i first heard it, and now seeing the love my daughters have for it makes this song even more gold to me.
We all love you so much for helping us wi
I didn't really like this song at first, but it grew on me. Right now I just can't stop listening to it and humming it
Sooo good 👍 everything- lyrics, music , voice, visuals

This rocks!🎉
I wish the closed caption was correct. I'm hard of hearing but i know some of it is wrong. You truly are missing a market of people for whom the words you sing have a great impact.
All your fans are 50+ boomers lmao
I like it I listen to the song after school
Dude! Your vocals and vibrado and breathing techniques are so on point it's awesome!   Your lyrics hit hard and it's refreshing to hear something so new and so deep yet simple in meaning!  Keep up the awesome work!!!!!!
What do you think this song is about???
The lyrics are hitting every sore spot. Coupled with the voice and expression, it's a timeless piece.
My 2 yrs old son love this song after hearing me listening a lots,. He like to listen and sleep off at night. Even in a day. Let thanks to our awsome singer Livingston... We don't need a diamond ring as well but we always wanted to hear ur voice
I’m gunna be honest…. I have many friends of mine that I have considered what it would look like if they were my future spouse. But there is one person that I’ve met that stood out to me… she is beautiful, inside and out. She lives for God. She loves the things I love, and is willing to try new things. She seems to support me in my endeavors of becoming a minister or missionary. And she cares for me when I am at an all time low. For those of us that seem like they have an idea of what they want in a relationship, maybe consult with God or a councilor of some kind. God is who has guided me to where I am now and He is the one who sent that girl I care for into my life. I’m still deciding on what to do next, but I know God has got it planned out already.
Good job I'm a big fan I love you
i love ur songs so much i don't like ur songs i love them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your amazing. Thank you for your music. Greats from the Netherlands
Can you drop the chords??, just love this song when i first heard the 15 seconds..
Hello, my sister introduced me to this guy and it looks like I'm hooked.   I'd like to know how do you interpret the lyrics "I just want the last man standing". What is it essentially asked? For me it doesn't feel like it's outliving your enemies/compete others/come on top, but yet again I don't know how to think of it.
Obsessed with this song❤❤
You need to get hooked up with some EDM producers like Armin Van Buuren. This could be a huge EDM track.
He's gonna be that song that comes on the radio driving to work everyday
Where can i listen that song? I don't see on his channel... Name pls?
Who else is here because of there mom
Awesome song
I'm 67 years young and I love love love this guy!!! Last man standing is my all time favorite love song, and I'm a life-long music listener. Keep writing and singing your heart out.

I'm 67, and I absolutely love your voice . I could play this over and over. I wish I'd have a love that you describe. ❤
🤩 words can’t even - it’s just knowing you are one of the first ones to see someone before they blow up and become famous. Wow, wow, wow.

*PADAYON LANG.*
This can be actually a song in a movie that has to do with war they go all around the world fighting for love and he come back in the last man standing or it could be a song about someone fighting for their love and that can also be another plane of the song he needs to that only sit there and sing the song where it has visuals in the song poor people will get what he's saying
Juste
sublime.....love it......thank you...
Long story, my youngest son died in 2016.  His birthday is coming up, I found your song and it reminded me of him.  Thank you, Thank you for your gift.

Tiger paw records.
Symphonics.
This song is so beautiful ❤
fantastic
This song was born to be in two major movies, one a romantic comedy, the other a romantic drama, one commercial for engagement rings, will be played at 83% of weddings in 2025, and in 2033 I'll be singing along with it (instrumental version) in a market before it settles into a classic and then 15 years after that, it'll be played in a really good Netflix series and the whole process will repeat.
Never go to Hollywood and just listen to your heart and Hollywood will just take over you stay independent young man and beautiful singer
Playwrites have Shakespeare, Poetry has Edgar Allen Poe, and now Music has Livingston. You will soar amongst the greats, a true artist with words. Keep at it. Your lyrics are beyond your years.
You HAVE TO make more songs like this ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I love it ❤❤❤❤
I was trying to watch his song named shadow but I forgot to put it on loop and it switched and was just started to think of growing up and moving and 10 years later i have kids and i am driving though my home town and and going to this house and going to the back porch and pretending to hold my dogs leash and start to cry i little bit and look where my mom used to sit and look at her and look at my dog  and making this i started crying halfway and most the time i tell myself to suck it up but i could not this time i could not
His voice and lyrics are haunting!
This man is truly divine 🤍🪶
Damn,this hits hard like a Train
I've been around the world Seven wonders, seven seas But when all is said and done you're the only thing I see my love So tell me what you're looking for? You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why you standing next to me, my love? So tell me what you're looking for?  … And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  … Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  … Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for  … I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  … and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  … Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing
it remindes me of young royals tbh
Call me crazy, but I feel like AI makes his songs and he's playing it up hard. It sounds to me like he typed into AI, write me a poppy love song that sounds like it was written by imagine dragons and one republic had a baby. For one kid to be able to compose this whole song all by himself and then every month come out with another banger? come-on. I'm not buying it.
Livingston, GREAT stuff man! Where can we buy?
OMG U SOUND AMAZING ❤😊😱🤗🤭😁😀😃😄😆🙂🙃it makes me so relaxed 😌🙃🙂🤗😊☺️
Breathtakingly beautiful!
Beautiful… both lyrics and music
Found this artist by accident on tik tok! Absolutely love his voice, terrific songs that we all in one way can relate to in our own lives!

I love your music. I love your voice. Your music speaks to my soul. Thank you for giving me an outlet for my sadness. This allows me to be  positive and upbeat irl.
<3 Searching for this love <3
You are awesome!!!
Hey!!!! Sending love and wishes from India 🇮🇳
Who needs a video when you have an amazing song.
If you wonder why so many older people comment …. So much screaming and nonsense words are put in songs these days along with voice altering techniques. Your voice is pure and beautiful and your lyrics have straight to the point lyrics. Your tones have such a huge range and is extremely pleasing to the ear. You are the new era of music the way it should be. Keep the dream alive.
Your song changed my life thank you
you absolutely smashed it, i love it not just for the words but how you sing it. great voice
You are so fucking inspiring. Love your Music and your Vibe ❤
All your songs are flawless and love every single one and waiting on the cliffs edge for more! Your voice is so sublime been listening since your cover days and obsessed with all your songs! Big love always from UK ❤❤❤❤
Blown away, moved from my head to my toes. So beautiful, thank you!

I absolutely LOVE this version - video and lyrics ❤❤❤❤
Me I'm in love with your music
Don't stop if you do I might just kill myself so please. Don't stop
Sublime ! J'adore
Heard this song 30 minutes ago and went right to YouTube and it’s been on repeat ever since. That voice touched something in my SOUL ! Omg
Hello Mr. Livingston, you are magic, go your way and never let yourself be taken, you are love and you have it, I am very proud that you exist. I bow to you because it's fantastic that there is someone like you. Big hug from wonderful Fred.
My favourite video of this song xxx
When you save every song your boys will like ,❤ thanks for making music my kids can live by ❤
You are angel.
Gives me goosebumps ❤❤❤❤
Super Star & also cute lol
Such underrated vocals, needs to blow up and get recognised for his talent ASAP! amazing vocal range and truly amazing songs
I found your song shadow on a YouTube short, I showed it to my mom and told her how amazing your voice is and now I am obsessed with your music!!
I am in love with your music
Pure art. Lovely.
I told a woman one time in tears that I wanted to give her the world but I don't know how and she said similar words as this song to me and at the time I was messing up with substance abuse and felt out of touch I was going through so much I was so lost and here in front of me I had someone that saw my potential and really loved me. Let's just say that those words that came out of her mouth turned a male into a man. I picked my life up and now I've been sober for many years bought a condo, I have a steady job, I have a music studio a car, a hobby grade drone (FPV) room to build drones from scratch. Sometimes that's all we need is for someone to tell you that all they want is YOU. Since I music produce (nothing on a professional level) I've been working on his song LAST MAN STANDING..... kind of like a remix but nothing crazy I still kept it sweet like the original. I hope you guys come across it when I post it on YouTube. I really hope Livingston does too and loves it. I go by the name GorillaPlanet as a producer name. This song is so powerful and this young man is so talented. These words couldn't have come out of thin air. This young soul has been through some stuff to write lyrics so deep. Listen to his other songs also and you guys will understand what I mean. God bless ya'll and this young man on his and ya'll journey.
Beautiful voice, lovely song; what a talented artist!!
intro is like someone like you by Adele
energetic ❤
I'm here from YouTube shorts .. dang this hits 🥹

Me
Love this ❤
Good job, great song
I’m a girl from Russia. and the first time I heard this song was in a TikTok video in January. This was the moment when sanctions disappeared for one day and my TikTok was able to show foreign videos. I cried from one verse, because these words convey incredible tenderness and show how to treat a loved one. Then I dreamed for a long time of finding this song on the Internet and waited for its release. And so, I found... and I cry again. We don’t have Spotify in Russia anymore, but I would be love to have this song in my playlist… thank u❤️
😢😢Bad😢😢😢😢😢song bad beat
That makes me cry. Why can't I find a person like that...
Honestly man, the message in the music, plus the fact he’s sitting on a navigational marker tree from travelers in the past seals the message all in one
I LOVE HIS VOICE I also sing and sing right along with him!
I can't help but sing along to everyone of his songs
It’s funny. I only found this song yesterday but I already feel like I’ve heard it 1 million times and it’s always been here. It’s a beautiful song thank you Livingston.
😍🌍
I want to find that kinda love
Басым кетеді ❤

Yes, right dont sell love for money or money for love. Its both different aspects of our life n they r both important. But dont need to sell or refuse one because of another one.
U sing with age and knowledge u aren't old enough to need to understand
I am 54 years old and absolutely LOVE your music and watching your videos ! You are so talented.
❤I wish I could get this young man to sing this at my son's wedding! This was the first song I heard of his, and every time I hear it, I think of my husband! Keep singing, Livingston!

The way he's doing the song right now just by himself singing about a love look for a girl is actually got ding perfect holy crap this would be a perfect stop song for a movie that has to do with two people in love or it could be for a action movie that has a love interest of a guy and a girl
I Love his music
Im here because this guy should of been heard 4 years ago but didnt cos people suck..
Is anyone here from the YouTube short?

I love this so much
I love this!
I love this song
When James Bond comes your going to Jail
Music name
Haiti loves you broh. this song is on repeat in our ears
l like this song
The lyrics last man standing doesn't fit with the rest of the lyrics. Other than that, phenomenal.
Please make one son about veterans!, your voice is angelical
you take me back to old times! this is music!!!! Love your voice
I LUVVV THIS SONG IVE LISTENED TO IT LIKE ONE MILLION TIMES
Very nice song but somehow the voice doesn't fit the music/melody of the song (I'm sorry but I'm honest, I listened to this song the 1st time ever, it's 20.04.2024). I have no idea who the singer is & all behind this song, but there's a feeling as if this song was meant to be interpreted by someone else. Really! This song itself is too delicate & the voice of the singer is too aggressive in my humble opinion. I'm sorry again but I'm honest.
I was trying to do homework while listening to this but it was distracting because of how good it is
be not afraid
I watch a lot of Ren on YT and you were thrown into my recommended as a result. Love your videos, especially the “give me 2 words or a phrase” song game. Found this song through thr reactor Joe E Sparks. 💜🥔
What a gift!
Ты круто парень, респект тебе из РФ!
I've been around the world Seven wonders, seven seas But when all is said and done you're the only thing I see my love So tell me what you're looking for? You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why you standing next to me, my love? So tell me what you're looking for?  And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for  I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

I cannot LOVE this song enough!
I’m a widow but if I remarry I will use this song. Beautiful- Kristin
I hope when you find your forever lady, that she sings this to you. Life is a bitch. My hubby and i just had 42 yrs in. We had our bad moments, and our wonderful moments. He will get venurable, and ask, are we still gonna be together? I always say, yes! I joke and tell him, too late now! Cheaper to keep her!!!! Lol!  Its worth working on, for any young folks reading this. I wanted to leave more than once, over the years, but im glad we worked it out. At our age, i don't know what we would do without each other.... We are pretty young yet. We got married out of the cradle, lol. The grass isnt greener, trust me....
Your amazing lyrics reach our souls, A new and sincere peformance. Wish you all the best, stay on the narrow right side of your true self.  Avoid adopting an ego and just keep singing your soul gifted words out.  Rosie Hoy New Zealand

❤
Your voice is healing for my soul ❤
Keep it up. You are a great composer and singer! But, do NOT sell out to the labels. They will hurt you more than they will help. Appeal to your fans to demand your songs. If they promote you, you will not be owned! Again, I really think you can do this without the big promoters!
I seriously love your songs!!! you inspire me day by day when i don't have the courage to keep myself together. Thank you for accompany  me in my way :)
I fucking ❤😂🎉
Thank you Livingston you brought happiness to my life with your music plz continue you have an amazing voice and your music is great keep it up

This song is for men, I believe. Making clear that woman want a man standing - not kneeling. Great lyrics - Great voice - Great melody.
great song
My cute little 6 year old grandson introduced me to Livingston. He sings his songs to me, the music is so much sweeter when Jullius sings it.
He is a poet. 🫶
I became your sincere fan plz sing as usual in my life
This song reaches into my soul and teaches me that there are loves that touch our hearts and minds.  This song is the dream of every person, to find that most amazing love someday.  I wish that for everyone.  You have the most beautiful voice, your words and melodies stay with us.  I pray that you have the future you deserve for giving us the gift of your songs.  Bless you.
Love you're voice and lyrics your amazing ❤

Music is alive again 😢
So, who has been reading my diary again?
Not me... I'm here bcuz I found the perfect woman for my life... That's y I'm here
Super talented… check out his older stuff also. He’s been putting great music out for years 🙏🏻
Livingston, you're wonderful. I'm almost 70 this year and I can tell you with certainty that "the last man standing"  is Jesus Christ of Nazareth. I have been to Israel. I have been to Nazareth. I swam in the Sea of Galilee for six days. No one could coax me out of this beautiful lake. Your voice and your songs remind me of this lake. So much peace, so much love, I could live forever. God just wants us to tell him who we are. The simple melody of life. This is your song. I'm so happy you are here on Earth at this very moment. Thank you, Livingston.
I am your biggest fan ❤❤❤

Livingston you are amazing such a unique beautiful voice wonderful talent ❤
Han minder utroligt meget om albert dyrlund
The voice ❤the lyrics👌
Look up... REN... Who's Ren? (again, that question)   Ren is ... a multifaceted musician skilled in beatboxing, guitar and bass player, pianist, producer, and storyteller who self-releases genre-spanning music. He is also an independent artist, number one bestseller, and rapper with slam poetry influenced by his mental health struggles. Ren even connects deeply with fans online while managing ongoing health treatments.  The everyday super genius .. you know.   (this was the short version)
I love you ❤️ ♥️ 😍 💗
You remind me of a singer, who is current...but independent . His name is REN. XX❤
I REALLY like the voice and how he uses it! The only minor 'comment' is his "staccato" style of vibrato. I'm sure I'll get used to it!! Liked and subscribed! Bravo!!!
Pretty sure he would have won American Idol!
Nop I looked for his songs
bro.. I love that you use your hands to show the direction of the tone and pitch. Makes it easy for me to sing along! Kepp on keeping on! Your music is soul music! Your song - Shadow, might just have saved my life. Thank you!
What if he did a collaboration with post Malone 🎉😂❤😢😅😊😮
I love it I am singing to it and I am ten
I love , love this song.
I am 70 and after hearing a short on YouTube couldn't get the song Shadow out of my mind.  I've lived through Elvis, the Beatles, Abba, Boney M, Doobie Brothers, CCR, Sabaton, and now a talent that belongs in this group Livingston.  Keep going Drake you are the talent.  Keep true to it.
I'm so impressed with your music!!
I'm happy I found your music
Thank you this the first time my friend puts effort in learning lyrics of a song. This song makes my cry so touching
Love his voice ❤
I discovered him an hour ago, in a short improv video on YT and fell in love with his music and his fantastic voice. I have already downloaded all his songs and listen to them non-stop. This kid is a blessing!
over 4M views and less then 100k people left a like...congratulation "people"
My gf wants to marry, I’m hesitating due to prior experiences. Would love to explain this to you. I’ll make you a promise. I’ll marry her if you reach out to us.

I honestly didn't think him and his younger self in some of his older songs were the same person until i saw a short of his glow up lol
Only 4 millions views for this song ...fuck the musical industry, and also the devil... This should be on every radio but first you have to sing on blood... Unfair...
Dude it's been so long since I heard this song happy I found it again
It’s really crazy that the internet could literally help those masterpieces to be found
Very good song for a film/drama I know the cdrama and kdrama will definitely😍 use this

What a pure message to an Era of pretend Kings and Queens!
Can you plz attach this song to a Romeo and Juliet theme...
Your blowing the Internet up!!! love it!
Love it
Great
I'm sorry for my behaviors. Never meant to hurt you. This song is true. When you make the first move I will follow.   I need to get to know you and see your personality to see if we have a future together and if I love you because I don't know. And to be fair you need the same from me too.
I like it better at 0:75  speed, makes me feel more calm. The fast ritm is nice but makes my heart rush..and also i think is more emotional like that.
So talented.  He’s going somewhere for sure!!!
U music is fantastic. Keep it on ..this song let me think alot  ...I love it .keep going and make more beautiful songs ..❤
Gonna sing this at my cousin's wedding in some few days to come
Listened shadow ❤ ed then searched for more and found Last man standing damn so nice... keep going so..so..so.. much  👍
This song is beautiful, you have an amazing voice may you go to the top of the music industry
I was mesmerized by this young man. I understand he has been taught by his mother. I wish him a bright future. May God bless you. I am from India and do pray fir my nation as it goes through election. We are ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE . YOUR SONG WAS UPLIFTING.
I love his songs so much😊❤
"I don't Need A Symphony, I just Want Your Voice & A Melody! I Don't Need Your Diamond Rings, I Just Want Your Love, Stop Selling Me! I Don't Need Your Wind That's Underneath Your Wings, I Just Want To Know When You're Landing! You Don't Need To Be The King, Cuz, I Just Want The Last Man Standing!" Amazing!!! 💓
I love you , sweetheart. I'm so proud of you. I'll see you, and Mom soon. It's almost over, yall❤
I feel like I fell in love with you, your music, and your adorable mom, one TikTok clip at a time.  So much talent! I love it!
He sounds bit like sia
Best song ive heard
This song hurts physically for me bcuz I'm going thru a divorce and it hurts so bad
This is what we call “MASTERPIECE “
Wow.. Golden Voice!
This is the song of yours I keep coming back to ❤ This is a masterpiece
sounds like Imagine Dragons with Meatloaf as the lead singer.
This guy is touring in small theaters.  Los Angeles only 30 bucks!!
This is my first time watching his new videos he looks so different lol love the song tho
Wasn't ready for the feel's today.
Did you sell your soul for this voice? because I've never heard anything like it and it's ungodly ❤️ just make sure if you made terms with Faust you get what you bargain for and make it worded properly because there are loopholes and he will most definitely play you if you don't play them card right 💯 🔥
this is my  Wedding.song
Wow! What a voice!!!
The short got me looking for the full version
You know what makes you different from the other artists? You don't need a crazy video to keep someones attention.... your voice is incredible and makes the whole job. It's a pleasure to look at you singing. Love your style ❤
:o brutal
This is so beautiful what an amazing voice
I just discovered you on Tik Tok and I'm hooked!  What a great talent❤
Superb words brother touch my heart
AMAZING Livingston!! AMAZING!! 🎉❤

Meslizzle
Silver Hyundai
Chanelle cicero
I pray his success does not steal his soul.His authenticity is .
His style is very “Imagine Dragons” I think his voice is great just wish he’d stop swinging his hands around.
The best artist wre the ones that aren't even signed.
I think you should make a song using the words out of confetti 🎊
Beautiful well done I love it
Thank you for bringing my day up 1:59

Who is here because you were wronged and need to believe that this woman actually exists somewhere out there?
This song pulled at my hart the truth about love is you don't see the glory you see the person you see their soul and he put it in perfect words, a truely magnificent song ❤🎉
80% of Imagine Dragons + 20% Post Malone. Change my mind
Some one is on a rocket! Talk about fresh!!! Stay indie - just reach out and ask Tom MacDonald to mentor you.
all the way from south Africa what a great music

The Bible says all have sinned and none are good. Nobody could ever be good enough to enter into heaven. In fact everyone deserves hell for our multitude of sins against a holy God.   But you can be saved and reconciled to God. Recognize your corruption. Recognize Jesus as Lord and Savior who raised Himself from the dead. Ask Him to rescue you. He shall not turn you away.  Put your complete faith and trust in Christ. He is your Lord/King/God.  And you are His. Bought with a price. His blood was shed so that you might believe and be set free from sin and death. And once you are His, He will lead you into obedience as evidence of your faith. You will become a new person 💖  John 3:3 Jesus answered and said to him, “Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  Luke 14:26 “If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. 27 And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.  John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.  Matthew 7:13-14 “Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.  1 Corinthians 6:9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, 10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.
That’s how I found him about a month ago
You are an incredible gift
This gives me chills

Incredible talent.  Please don't change.
Im hete because of a short.i love this young mans music.
Love this guys voice. Such great music
Found this song on Facebook and now I'm so attached to this song, there is something about it that's sad. I'm just loving it thank you for making this song this is my main now and I listen to it every day even in the shower which is weird because I never listen to music in the shower but this song is truly something else. This song changed me from being lazy to super motivated and working out a lot more. Love you livingston thank you for bringing this masterpiece into my life
Here after seeing "sit if you have anxiety short"...and now I'm never leaving 🥺😍😍😍 your voice is just, wow. Gift from the heavens. You can bring many to our Lord brother, use that voice how god intended!!! ❤❤❤
Nádhera mohla bych to poslouchat hodiny. Nádherný čistý hlas😊😊😊
I can’t tell if I like your music or not I’m conflicted because some part of me says yes while the other half says no
Imagine dragons mixed with the kid Laroi like 100%. He sounds exactly like them and is stealing their writing styles. Nobody these days is unique :(
Such a heavenly sound. How great GOD the author of music is. Thank you JESUS. You are amazing GOD.
This is going to be playing at my wedding 😍😍😍 thank you so much for this
I can’t quit listening to this music!  I agree with others please don’t sell your soul to the devil to get a contract with some scumbag producer when you can do it yourself!  Steer clear of hollyweird!
If you need counseling on the music career without relying on the music machine talk with Tom MacDonald or Thomas Day.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Where is this beat from? It sounds like a slowed down version of “on your own” - Justin stone
a peace full home front
I've been around the world Seven wonders, seven seas But when all is said and done you're the only thing I see my love So tell me what you're looking for? You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why you standing next to me, my love? So tell me what you're looking for? And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

Doesn't come close to the artists from 80s-90s, but these kids like goofy things nowadays.

Just found him and his music. Great lyrics and talent. Deserves to go far.
Love this song and Shadow
Love you ❤❤❤beautiful music ❤❤❤
My son sent me this song to play for my fiance to listen to when I see her next but I listened to it and it made me realize how in love I am with her and how much I want to spend the rest of my life with her. It made me realize I don't think I can love anyone else as much as I love my fiance. Great song, thank you for this song.
You are amazing! Thank you for sharing your gift with us. I found you just recently and this song kept coming up on the shorts and every time it did, I watched it...all the versions, and every time! And I still watch because you are remarkably gifted.
This guy has another world talent. His voice 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This song gives me goose bumps. Only wish I had found this sooner.
C'est magnifique way cool 👍
God has given you such a gift, and you share so willingly.... every song grips my  sense of soul. Thank you for teaching me to feel again.
Never sell your soul for fame ❤ hope to see you one day in the Netherlands, i will buy a ticket to your concert 😉

Amazing young man
Create an Florida Company for your music and I will be an investor. Get real people who believe in you and run your company for the highest and greatest good. Also, happy to play bass professionally for your tour/gigs. Ron
Amazing,,he feels this,it pours out of his soul.
Merci pour ce morceau qui me fait du bien ❤
Do you guys imagine how many great amazing songs and artists debuts we would have missed or never heard of if it was not for social medias and YouTube. That's quite crazy when you think about this fact. We can criticize social medias as much as we can but cannot deny the amazing and positive side of it as well.
Wow…. Beautiful
I was confused as I have this in my liked on Spotify already 🤣
I do love this song. The video,gowever, doesnt really work for this song. I do admire you for going hard after tour dream. You've got this!
I'm playing this at my parents wedding . his voice is angelic !

Yea…definitely vibing to you on my next road trip in 2 weeks 💜
I want to give kudos to your health journey. You look great and your voice is amazing! Great artist indeed
I have not heard this song until yesterday.  It was bizarre as if I had already heard it for years. Once the chill bumps went away I checked out his other offerings. What a talent. I am so sorry that it sounds like there has been pain in his life.  Hope he knows that out of the pain and anxiety a unique and beautiful voice has developed.
Your him ain't you
So I been listoning to your lyrics and I'm not gonna say what your talking about but  ok I see I now know who you are as in the real you are dang
I found myself singing this song for days! It's literally stuck in my head and I am addicted! The beat and the rythem in his voice which matches and combines so perfectly and effortlessly.  Keep going livingston, you have our attention. Sing with the gift God gave you!!
Doing good man❤

I fall in love with his voice...
Je ne m'en lasse pas. Cest juste trop bon. Juste magnifique. Tu t'améliores, cest fou! C'est tellement bon d'écouter ce son. Un pur moment de bonheur.
I can understand what he’s singing. So many artists do not enunciate well or are accompanied by music that drowns out the lyrics. This is very refreshing!
Thanks for this song. Genuinely the best one I've found so far this year.
DON'T  EVER STOP SINGING.......AND LOVING YOUR MOM😊
I'm here because I watch Instagram reels and I really like the song❤
This had me in tears! Fantastic brother
👍🤗👋
I took a screenshot of one of your fan's messages for this song that I REALLY think you NEED to see. It should make your week, at least. How do I forward it to you?
WOW !!!!!!!!! What a VOICE ❤ This is MUSIC! This is absolutely beautiful.. Thank you for sharing this song with us ! 💜
I just stumbled across your video and wow! You are amazing. You have a very beautiful voice. You will go far in this world. Good luck!
Listening at the school bus stop with my 6 year old daughter in Colleyville
You and Brandon Lake would be a symphony, a collab would be incredible. Loving your music, keep it up!!

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read the messages. Stay true to yourself and avoid the big recording studios. They will ruin you for the bigger buck. Your voice is  truely unique and  you're doing a very good job of self promotion on social media.  Best of luck.   Some old fart from England.
Keep it coming❤
Beautiful 💫

your songs have opened my eyes alot of stuff ive been dealing with personally and im so glad i found your music its so amazing
Go to a record company who will let you sing your own music they’re out there you just have to find them or do it yourself go to recording studio and start peddling it out like they used to then you could go to a record label and then you could have it mass produced in your name
❤❤❤❤❤❤
i legit said ":wow" out loud while listening to this.
Absolutely beautiful!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
💜🎶thanks for the great music  🎶
I just love your voice. - Congratulations on your success from Australia.   This song is soo beautiful

Continue the hard work man
Continue the hard work man
Came from Tik Tok
This song is my favorite. Although I do like all of them so far. You have a beautiful voice and it doesn’t hurt, that you have looks going for you as well.  I love how supportive your mother is of you, and your music. You will go far with a strong support team.
OMG this brought me to tears.  You are So talented
You're so talented and so beautiful, don't let Hollywood buy you, talk to Tom Macdonald stay you and stay independent, never sell that beautiful voice
Amazing how you capture everything in a single song.....
Dude…..sometimes life surprises you and today I found you. What a gift you have bro. That short you did with your mom on piano is priceless gold. The kind money can’t purchase.
HELLO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR  LOVELY MUSIC  AMEN  SISTER HELEN  🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟
From Colombia, this song is amazing!
i seen you on a Facebook reel, hey my man you are awesome! i love this! kind of reminds me of Imagine Dragons & JID - Enemy!!!
To stay independent look into Tune Core you keep all your music rights and streams you will get all credits. I love your music and not have your dreams stolen from you,  God Bless
you need a girl to collab with and have them sing the last part of the chorus or the whole last chorus
Wow he is amazing!  ❤❤❤❤❤.  I am a 66yr old grandma loving his voice and lyrics.
I truly hope you will not sign with any of these satanic recording companies. Trust me, you are invaluable if you stay like this, true to yourself anf God that gave you that talent.
Very talented, I'm mesmerized by the tone of his voice.
Masterpiece 🔥💕
The delivery of these songs with this vocal power and beautiful lyrics.....this man is a rare talent, coming from someone who was a vocalist myself. Keep giving your heart and sould to your music....Current Member of ASCAP since 1996.
I love it 🥰

Just came across you on YouTube absolutely amazing what a voice brilliant song just cried when i heard the words love this song
Just Divinely Beautiful. All the very BEST to you.
Bro we have a same name
Wow what a beautiful voice
Livingston......I'm 60 yrs old. I haven't watched tv for over 10 years now. But I can't imagine going a day without any music.  I listen to all different jandras. ie Iris Demendt, Faith Hill, Pink, Pussy Cat Dolls, Poison, GnR, Motley, Metalica, CCR, J. Cash, J. denver, C.Carpenter, Rodger Whitticker,  K. Rock, Fk1rst, Eminem, AC/DC, Korn, Triumph, Journey, R.E.O. BTO, Rush, Toby Keith, NuBreed, Yellawolf, Post Malone, etc...I am a huge fan of anyone that is unique, creates what they want too reguardless of any outcome. Also huge fan of artists such as Leo C. who can sing a song in a way that you know they are singing from a place deep within their heart and soul. A song that comes to mind is P.Malone singing his song I Fall Apart. Not just spitting out words. There are songs with lyrics performed with so much emotion that hit so hard and are felt deep in ones soul. I will never know how she can sing that one song of hers without melting down until she's just a puddle of tears lying on the floor. I think its about one of her parents and it breaks MY heart and makes me cry every time I hear it. You have this same ability to affect people with your music. Dont ever sell your soul for $. Keep working hard at doing what you love. The world needs people like you and is a better place when artists such as yourself are in it sharing your talent for all to enjoy. May God Bless you young man.   And ummm yeah, just a couple more things I need to let you know. I just listened to this song of yours for the first time tonight. Im a little hard of hearing and so i found a video with printed out lyrics so i could read the words while i heard you singing them. Its a beautiful song. Very well done. Bravo. Im an old school romantic.I have a very generous, passionate, loving, kind, courteous forgiving nature. I have children that I love  deeply. Unfortunately my wife ran off with my best friend and divorced me when our youngest of 3 children was just 5 months old. 😮 I havent found anyone else to be with sinse then and that was back in 1991. I want so much to find someone who will love me in return as much as i do them. But i havent yet. When I listened to and read the words to this song it brought back memories of how desistated i was and still am today to have lost the one i married, loved so deeply, and gave her all i had completely and unconditionally. How I wish sooo bad she would have said to me the lyrics you wrote in this song. I started crying as i listened to and read this song. Tears are still streaming down my face an hour later now as Im writing this comment. This is how your music has affected just me. A complete nobody, a pennyless, homeless, broken old man who struggles daily just to obtain food to eat, water to drink and somehow get some sleep somehow up here in this cold of nothwest Wisconsin.   The last thing I want to share with you and to anyone who may accually read this. ( i highly doubt that anyone will read my words or hit the like button because my voice and opinions  have never been important to or appreciated by anyone my entire life. I feel like the invisible man I swear. It has made for a very unfullfilling lonely life for me that has me feeling my existence is meaningless). Any who.....sorry bout that....uh.....where was i...?  Oh yeah. PEASE. !!!!!  Look up a song called "she loves you" performed by Johnathon Edwards. It's a cover song he does of an old Beetles song. Im crying now even harder because Im remembering the words to that song. I havent listened to it for over 18 years now but still recall every note, melody and lyric in that song he did. Wow...i amaze myself sometimes how still have complete songs and all their  lyrics memorized and can sing them as if id just learned them today but its actually been 20, 30, 40 years ago or more. I cant recall the name of the Johnathon Edwards album that the song "She Loves You"  is on . But I will look it up and post it as as comment on this comment of mine. 😊 ✌️n❤ T.L.E.  artist  -  Johnathon Edwards album   -    My love will keep song      -     SHE LOVES YOU  Give it a listen. I'd luv to hear your rendition of this song. How you'd put your own spin on it. I know you could do this song well and would be awesome if you recorded and put out a cover of it. It could be a stepping stone that helps you fulfill your dreams ya never know. Just an idea for you to try. But do it quickly. Because now that I posted this comment publicly, it my inspire someone else to do it and they might do it before you get the chance to do it first. Either way. Just a thought. Hope you and anyone  else who checks out that song enjoys it as much as I do.   Wishing the best for you in all you choose to do.   ✌️n❤n 🙏 God Bless T.L.E.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
fucking beautiful shit
That amazing, from 🇻🇳 with love ❤

Чавми лучи лукин фоо
What a great voice! What a great song!
Don't sell out. Keep making amazing music on your own without influence. We will pay. We will come see you. Be your own manager.
I stumbled on this accidentally a few days ago and I've been listening non-stop. Quite possibly my new favorite artist. I feel this in my bones. 🖤
One of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard ❤❤❤
This is missing something... the mix tells all. Did you edit out something? Did u leave it open for collab? This song hits
Love this song😊💕

😍😍😍
Love this. Love your voice young man. My wife is a music award winner and we have kept away from signing with a label we get to keep 100% of everything. Writing a book was the best thing she ever did. CD’s were a great business card but not used now. A musician is not the easiest to make a living from any more. The key to it is to keep putting out music. Put on your post a QR code that directs people to buy your singles. Maybe an explanation of where the money might get you to….a gig …..a recording studio…..to sing with someone that can add a different language to your music would be a big sell.
amazing song amazing character !
Please tell me how to get the piano cords to learn to play this ❤ wish to sing this to my wife on our wedding day
You are so special ,talented . 🌟🌹🇨🇦 You are a 🌟 project that voice. Good luck ☘️
outstanding you go man
Your voice and music brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. It is felt not just heard. A rare and amazing talent.
really like this songgg
I feel this song so much... This song gives me all the feeling.... I love it so much, it really has been helping me... Thank you 🥰
What a delightful find. I don't follow many people or artist but I  will follow you. I feel you have a beautiful future ahead and I pray you find your way into the radio. I can see you melting a lot of hearts. Bless you and your gift.
He has such a unique beautiful voice wow!
Don’t ever sing up with a big label. They will own you completely. Trust me I was in the music business and you willl not like who runs it. It’s totally sick and perverted. It’s all true what you hear. The conspiracy are not so conspiracy after all. At the age of 17 I was offered a chance of a lifetime at a very reputable studio in Florida. I was offered a 5 year contract on the spot in exchange for sexual activities with other much older male producers. Stay your course. You don’t need them. Be independent and you will love what you do for ever.
Good song ❤ keep it up this good work its art youre making bro god bless you !
Love ❤this.
I hope one day you're selling tickets in the uk cause ill definitely be getting a ticket 🙂 good luck for your future
This song is good
This song is beautiful! ❤ Don't change! Your perfect!

great words you can feel the emotion when he sings
👍👍
Wow, this guy is good. Like seriously.
I am from malaysia. I really love this song too much🥹🥹
Woow
Это жесточайшее подражание песням группы İmagine Dragons!!!!! Плагиат!!! Plagiarism!!!
On the contrary, my good old friend:  Symphonies are the best 💫  2. While the concept of love can be monetized, it is the talent and the craftsmanship that (rightfully) earns popularity and money for the author, it's not the original inspiration. Even the best inspiration is nothing without the Inspired Master Creator who would turn it into the Masterpiece! Any inspiration would be lame to claim the fame and shame the Master's effort. 😌  You are right in other aspects, this amazing part of THE Masterpiece, is A Masterpiece! Your vocals and your passion totally grant that label ❤️‍🔥
I love this song I cant let a day go pass without listening to it❤ love from South Africa
i love this song - the quietness is just beautiful and his voice just shines through!!!!
I'm stuck with the voice and lyrics ❤❤❤❤this is beautiful

I love this song!!!!!! thank you. I listen to it over and over!
First time I heard this song on TikTok I had to go and search for d rest of d song...❤❤❤...I fell in love with u're songs❤❤❤
You give me Imagine Dragon vibes especially with the song you're about to release
I love this song, and the way you deliver it. Even the air piano is enchanting. I'm one who is very quick to fall to, too much music it puts me in a trance. It's too good.
Dude your vibrato is insane❤
Absolutely incredible ❤what an incredible song writer. A modern day Elton John. Wow just wow.
❤❤❤great voice and songs 🎵 😢😢😢😂😂😂❤❤❤
It is pitty that many people listen only to English sung sonhs. You are missing too much of really perfect things. Learn more languages, listen also to non-English songs (often you feel the vibe, message, mood without understanding the language - music is the language)
I’m from Brazil! Just found out thanks to the algoritmo. So beatiful voice and lyric.
Summary: this song is an (sorta) tribute to his wife (disclaimer : shes still very much alive and is not in any way dead)
I love it ❤️ finally found some music today's date that actually makes sense and can touch our souls as music was intended for ! I love your music 😍 keep Inspiring our souls it's beautiful ❤️

Beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your recording audio effect = 100% Hi-Fi recording sound....   Bring  more some momentum sound breaking song  too much flat but crecendo/decendo melody to standout your voice upfront....  Then you'll rock the musical world.....
You are amazing!  I love your voice!  I’ve listened to this all day.
This is pure! Love listening to your music! I follow you on Facebook and seeing you song while your mum plays is amazing!
I would love to see you in concert, but you don't come near Mobile, AL :( love your music though <3

You have SO much potential. Great Artist and Musician. Thank You for Sharing:) WOW
Wow this is beautiful. Grandma of 6 and I love listening to an exceptional artist. Your voice and tone is amazing. My friend thought I was listening to Sam Smith. Wish you all the luck in the world but with talent like you have, you won’t need it. Love seeing your mum playing piano.
This is a man who has definitely been through something in life
Ed sheeran move out the way . Simon Cowell sign this guy before your competition does. Absolutely beautiful

I love this song it’s so beautiful
Hye,bro.Can u make some song for me? It about my life being upside down for a girl,being rape and got un fairly life,now I have men I love but I got to know that he don't even love me for 20 years now,he use me,but I have to give up to life, I m still  upset,I need to get up and be my self back,a happy go lucky women I ever been,but this depression Anxiety and stress slowly kill me inside.
Im addicted to this ❤
I accidentally happened across This Channel. Glad I did!
More More MORE!
❤
Luar biasa, liriknya benar-benar indah... Sangat menyentuh...❤
im 95 years old and i wear diapers
I can't stop listening to this album. It's not even just about the songs or just about the lyrics. Which are both absolutely incredible and phenomenally done. ❤ It is the hometown, one of your best friends you miss, a hugger kind of vibe that he really gives the world. Love love love this and can't wait to see him EVERYWHERE
These lyrics break me down. They’re so beautiful and remind me of the songs my fiancé would sing to me  years ago before he passed away due to covid. He had an angelic voice much like this young man.  He was my Romeo and I his Juliet. When he did venues and sang a song with another girls name in it, he’d replace it with mine even if I weren’t there with him.  On our bad days He’d say, it’s us against the world baby. Now it’s just me wondering why my children and I were left alone, struggling without our rock. Sometimes my tears feel like the waves of the ocean, drowning me, I feel so lost without him. How does one get on with life when their soulmate was ripped from their grasp in just three days?! I didn’t even have time to say goodbye bc it happened all of a sudden. If you guys ever find that one person in your life, treat everyday like it could be their last! Cherish every second.
Wow 😯
A true love song for the ages. Thank you Livingston.
beautiful. I suppose this will be 50M in a month
I’m so glad I’m here now!
Pozdrowienia z Polski. Niech gwiazdy kłaniają się tobie do stóp
This was the best thing that ever happened to me with music. I was 11 (now twelve) and my Mom showed me this song. I memorize the whole song in 3 days. It is just beautiful and I love this artist so much! Thank you for being here and alive for us!
Are you a Christian?
Absolutely love this song...  this song would be an absolutely hit on the charts with some good bass to it
I love 💕 this song so much❤❤❤❤❤❤
I’ve got around the around the world lived 100 fancies but then all said and down why you standing next to me mo love
I fell... I fell straight to the ground, knees bent down pouring out my soul as I screamed in agony of what I lost in that moment.   Years went by, I hid myself in a dark place, staying away from everything that reminded me of you. Did you know , you were my superman, did you know you were my safe place.  I'm on my feet now, in walking , I don't for shoes and the ground sure does burn, the air is thick and suffocating, but I walk , it's foggy and my eyes are burning, but I walk, I cant go back to hiding , so I walk...
What song is this?
❤
я случайно встретил тебя в ютуб шортс и залип, твоя музыка завораживает, браво👏👏👏👏
Боже, чувак, это шедеврально, я не понимаю, какого х*ра тут всего 2 ляма, это бесспорно заслуживает большего!!!!😮😢
I love the areas you are! It's so peaceful and beautiful. Fields that tree... Can't wait to see the next ones. I love nature, but unfortunately I have to have neighbors. I'd love to have a small cottage with a creek running under it and tucked away in a hole in the middle of nowhere with a forest and beautiful fields around it. Sort of like in Merlin where it's closed off from the world and you can get in and out and no one else can find it.
I heard this song for the first time the other day. I keep finding myself singing it
I LOVE IT ❤
Does anyone else feel as though we're witnessing the beginning of something very special?!?
This guy is AWESOME! Best new singer I’ve heard ! Excellent
National Treasure this man is!

The opening piano bars remind me a lot of So Cold by Ben Cocks. It also reminds me of some Luis Capaldi. Beautiful and enveloping.

I love this song I can't stop listening 🎧 to it I hope we hear more from him
This guy is fantastic
So beautiful... ❤
❤ he has the most amazing voice and still.  He would be great with Kelly Clarkston
Is there some unwritten rule that you have to let everyone know your age anytime you comment as soon as you turn 40?  Anyway….. this song is super beautiful, Livingston. Ageless. 😉
Love it!!!
your music helps me stop holding my breath and clenching my everything.
this song is underrated 🫶🏽
Hermosa canción 💗. No cambies nunca. Traduce al español tus composiciones por favor.  Saludos desde Culiacán Sinaloa, México
Livingston where are you making this video?? Beautiful the Song and the place ❤❤
Only 54 seconds in but, for improved music video esq idea, could have had a slow rollin shot while beat was playing and as you started to sing, do a rotating shot circling around you, and as the tone builds transfer to a spining camra towards the tree tops(potentialy with a subtle transition to drone footage spining out from the trees into a sky/forest landskape with a visible path where the drone visual is similar to a birds eye on somone or a couple walking in the path, with some transfers back and fourth to the tree with you in some different positions singing.
🤗🙏❤️‍🔥
You can just tell when someone is about to bust out everywhere don't you?  His voice, his intensity, his depth.  Damn son, good for you!
Love it! I haven't heard such a great, impressive song for a long time.  All the best, happiness and success!
You are exactly what the musical world needed.   Your voice is a blessing - thanks for sharing it with us.  Absolutely stunning vocals! 🥰❤ …

Modern day werewolf 🐺
fantastic !
I'm a big time hard rock/metal fan.  My go to playlists usually include Tool, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, things like that.  But this was really, really good and something I would also listen to as well.
just, wow, along with a side of chills.
This guy has a lot of potential.
Just discovered you! Really love what you’re doing! Thanks for putting it out there.
I just found him on tiktok listening to the short version of this song and started to cry because there is so much emotion in this song. I hope he keeps up making beautiful songs.
great!
Best song i ever heard, tears are rolling down atm. This song means a lot to me... thx for bring this song to the world🙏
Thanks for making my day! And sing a song from my heart! BEAUTIFULL And song SO WELL! All the best to Livingston
Goosebumps

Amazing voice! You’re so blessed! Remember that!
... this is breathtaking and lifegiving.. the way music should be
Powerful Voice  Wonderful  loving From Myanmar
Well donr bro
It's first time I listen to this song and I have goosebumps
I love this song and I want it for my wedding song
Music transcends age, class, background, style. All it needs is for us to find it beautiful, or soothing,  or inspiring, or thought-provoking. Maybe all of those things, if we are lucky. And we found it. Livingston has an Old Soul, eternal quality, right down to his clothes. That post WWII wardrobe is gorgous! I love how supportive (if awkward feeling in front of a camera) his family is. It has been an extra joy to see his mother through this. Being a mom, I'm feeling her proud mom vibe, and i love it! He's the heart and vision of a poet. I can't wait for the album, and I can't wait to see what he does next!
❤❤❤потрясающе!!!!
This the reason I ❤ YouTube this talent needs to be heard!!!! Amazing 🤩
I can't stop listening this briliant young man. His words and music touch my soul. ❤
Engaged 4 the algorithm

Beautiful poetry ❤
Great voice!👍
🇧🇷❤️🎧🥰💋
@Livingston or somebody else that knows how to use music software should do a mashup of this and Imagine Dragon’s Whatever it Takes; I think they would sound really beautiful together!
Oh wow! So beautiful I just stubble on your music from the shadow song. Listen to all of your music. So powerful
Just BRAVO my man. 🔥
Everything you sing is amazing ❤
WOW Beautiful song!! You're voice is AMAZING!! Just found you on here and just WOW 😊
Your voice and how you use it is incredible
The beginning reminds me of so cold by ben cocks
Goose bumps from my toes to my head  - makes me feel like I'm floating above it all - free from all pain and sorrow. Awesome ✌️
PATD vibes, awesome.
First listen was the studio version on IG and all honestly it brought tears swelling to my eyes! I absolutely love finding artists that have real soul within their tune and authentic talent that has been practiced relentlessly. But no matter how hard you practice there are only so many people in this world that can sing like you do Livingston.  Congratulations to you and also to your momma, you are both so blessed and lucky to have one another. 🥹
Awesome ... Beautiful ....  Thank You!
🥰🤍❤
What a happiness when, randomly, YouTube recommends artists like this. I'm 51 and I love this kind of music, an artist who is not only for young tastes, but a wonderful musician. A perfect mix between Lewis Capaldi and Imagine Dragons...BRAVO!
I really thought the lyrics were gonna go to "I dont need a symphony. I just need your company" at some point haha. I kepty adding it to the lyrics
Your the best singer I have ever heard. Keep up the amazing work
Top Song.... 😍😍🥰🥰
DIVINE
I have finally come across a song i genuinely like it honestly well done!!
What a great voice and unique sound. I like how he conducts as he sings.  This song is absolutely beautiful. ❤
I like your music so much and your vocalizing of the greatest music that I ever hear you should sign up for Americans got talent and sign up for that show around the world and see if you can win the biggest prize of all and make people very happy to listen to your musicI recommend you to go to Americans got talent
It's so wonderful to hear the WHOLE song!❤  Watching you sing reminds me so much of my youngest daughter. Lola. the facial expressions and the way your hands signal to the music. She does the same thing.  You are both natural talents and beautiful souls and I'm excited to follow your journey. Keep being true to yourself and the talents God has blessed you with.
You are FIRE 🔥!!!!!!!
Beautiful.  Thank you.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You, dude, are freaking amazing! 💙🎶#fuckanxiety

It always amazes me that in such little words, can be so powerful. Very impressed by this song.
He feels every word with emotion and heart felt movement.  Very gifted. He is the music Man indeed. Well done young man . Your mum is obviously very proud of you. Lots of success to you .but be aware of others in the future telling you how and what to do with your creations. If you get signed up to any big music industry.  Wishing you only the very best.  You truly enjoy every word and note produced. You show it perfectly. Well done .Never change unless you truly what to.

I don't care how old you or I, we are, love doesn't change.  The feeling, when it's real, you feel it.  Feelings have no age.

Gen X'er here!!!!  I am so excited to get to see you in Portland this June!!!
This breaks my heart with its Beauty.
Found you on tiktok, so glad I can hear the songs in full now.
I've been around the world Seven wonders, seven seas But when all is said and done you're the only thing I see my love So tell me what you're looking for? You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why you standing next to me, my love? So tell me what you're looking for? And you said I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Ooh, ooh Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh Been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love Just tell me what you're looking for? 'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling, this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing and you said I just want the last man standing, now (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) (Ooh-ooh) and you said I just want the last man standing (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) Oh, I don't need a symphony (ooh-ooh) I just want your voice and a melody (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) And I don't need your diamond rings (ooh-ooh) I just want your love, stop selling me (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh) I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing
I admit this is a video i can just watch all day every day. Apart from the absolutely stunning lyrics sung with such a pure voice, the simplicity of you in that tree, conducting your own voice. Hypnotic and surreal. Helps ground me when disassociating and on a low. So thank you so much. ❤❤
This song is so good I love it so much!! Your voice is so beautiful I hope to hear more music from you
omg the voice ,,i love the quivers in your voice ,
Your voice is a God giving gifted ❤️
Anyone else think this song would work brilliantly with a Lost Frequencies remix?
In my 60s, wow, your so talented love new music great voice powerful
This is true love not war ❤️💎
Wow!  I've been involved in writing and singing, from the heart inspirational music, for a very long time and your God given talent is always wished upon, never learned and holds a miraculous power that few "musicians" & listeners will ever understand but they will be enlightened when blessed to receive.  I pray that you always recognize this and will continue to use it in exactly the way that you are.   Please keep it up and may God continue to bless you with your gifts.  Keep it real, avoid the worldly madness and just continue helping others realize the power of the universal language of music.  Those riches last forever and He will take care of the rest.  If you are interested in recording more inspirational music on a mass scale with someone who understands the same, I have a Christian friend "in the biz" that I would like to inform you of.  No fancy introductions, no worries, no strings.  Just a feeling of inspiration bestowed upon me.  The Lord works in mysterious ways and I hope He will lead you to follow the path He has you on.  Keep it up!  I'll be listening. Peace!
I'm hooked 😊
Bro you made me stop what I was doing when this was playing. Hats off to you.
Can't get enough of this song 🤣🤣🤣 it's wicked sticks in your head too much 😂
The perfect lyrics in my heart this past month. It is like you looked into my heart. I am so blessed to find your Insta and get the blessing of your song writing, style, heart and musical talent. ♥ Can't wait to hear more!

This song is so beautiful
Do not let Hollloweird take your soul.  Seriously.  You will be much better off producing your own music and owning it.  Take a page out of Tom McDonald's playbook.
You will Forever Be the Last Man Standing And Your view Is A memory of A Place I once Knew Id Sit by This Pond And think About You and I And Our Future I Never Knew Them My Entire Life Would  be Forever Changed Once I Had To Let You Go So I Believed It Wouldn't Hurt As Badly When You Never Came  But You never Did This universe Is Bigger Then I  but The Amount Of Love Ill  Carry For You inside Old Fill Many your My Universe ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omgosh! His voice is so beautiful.
Magnifique chanson avec une belle Voix♥️😍
Thank you Hun so glad you did this❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So dreamy - makes feelings boble in me - love from Denmark.
All of the sudden this young man's videos started popping up in YouTube Shorts.  I had to find out more about this artist.  I love his music.  He has something to say.  He's definitely caught my attention.
hes flow at 0:34 to 0:40 reminds of another old song just cant figure it out
Look. I am a metalhead and a rocker all my life by heart, but this is brilliant. We need more of this and less of the trashy pop music that pops up the past few years
Can I just tell you that that's a masterpiece? I have worked out and this song is on repeat. The last 40 minutes blasting. I love it!
i love this song so❤
Zooo mooooi liedjeeee
This is not even my preferred genre but I'm ready for the album to drop.  I've heard so many good singers that are so generic and just more of the same, but not this guy.  I'm just blown away by his voice.  At 42 years of age I can count the number of singers that impressed me with the uniqueness of their vocal talent and this guy just got added to that very short list.  He really is just that good.  Wow, still in awe.
i love this as young artist still working to pull something together  It is great to him his unique style
This song is absolute perfection 🫡
Mooi ❤
Gave me chills! I love it when songs speak to my soul
I was just listening to this in the kitchen and my 2 year old son came in and wanted to dance with me. A beautiful memory made with this song. Thank you
Love your voice ❤
can‘t stop listening to this beautiful song .. just simply love EVERYTHING about it❤
love that song😍
Bro. Congratulations 👏 so beautiful. ❤
I can't breathe when I listen to it, it's so beautiful and incredibly emotional ♥
I love this song so much, and was sad to see this was the "official" music video.. even the camera doesn't stay steady.. plus what's this safari look for?... I'd suggest a duet with a woman and have it shot inside a broken house during dinner or something... Where you and her are sorta in an argument... And then let her sing the last man standing part.. just an idea.. scratch the broken home.. maybe your at work and she is there with the kids..
Kenza and I love this song :)
MASTERPIECE 👏👏
I found u on tiktok
Are we going to talk about his weight loss it’s incredible. Keep it up
Love his voice
Idk but I feel like I should attempt an acoustic version of this! Love this song!
Livingston, loving your work. Time for someone to find you and seal the deal for a musical future that will set you and your music onto the mainstream, a young man with your talent it’s criminal not to be.
❤

You keep on going I lost my singing voice
My 12 year old son played me this song because he thought I’d like it. It. Hit. Hard. I stood there leaning against the wall, crying my eyeballs out, and I don’t even know why. This song brought something so universal, and so fundamental through. I feel like I healed a million lifetimes listening to it. Thank you.
hermosa 🖤

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
This song is amazing!!! ❤❤❤❤❤

Great song bro!   Constructive feedback personally I feel it went a bit weird towards the end but each to their own and this is your own song!   I have a feeling there is gonna be a crazy good dance remix using your chorus… David Guetta

Last Man Standing - Lyrics  I've been around the world Seven wonders - seven seas But when all is said and done You're the only thing I see my love  So tell me what you're looking for  You're written in the stories A living masterpiece So when all is said and done Why're you standing next to me? My love  So tell me what you're looking for  And you said: I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  I've been around the world Lived a hundred fantasies But when all is said and done You're the only one I need, my love  Just tell me what you're looking for  'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard Darling this is love not war All I want is who you are That's what I've been looking for  I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing  And you said: I just want the last man standing  And you said: I just want the last man standing  Oh I don't need a symphony I just want your voice and a melody And I don't need your diamond rings I just want your love, stop selling me  I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings I just want to know when you're landing You don't need to be the king 'Cause I just want the last man standing

Wow! Wow! WOW!!!!!
Amazing ❤
I love this song so much! Incredible!  I have a question, however. At 2:19 you can suddenly hear a scratching or tugging sound. I noticed it tonight when I was listening to the song with my headphones. However, it is everywhere, regardless of whether it is YouTube, Spotify or which device I use to play the song.  Does anyone know what I mean? Surely that can’t be intentional? 🙈🙈  Much love <3
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 AMAZING I WILL NEVER NOT LIKE ANY OF UR MUSICE

Omg!🫂
