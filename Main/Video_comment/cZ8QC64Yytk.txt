Moonbin😢😢 rip
For anyone wondering I think this was all the groups who performed in order (of when their names popped up on screen) 1. Red Velvet 2. TxT 3. NU'EST 4. ITZY 5. NCT 127 6. Astro 7. Stray Kids 8. OH MY GIRL 9. aespa 10. ATEEZ 11. The Boyz 12. ENHYPEN 13. Brave Girls 14. STAYC 15. IVE  I think it's correct but if I've made a mistake please lmk! Hopefully this is helpful 🥰

guys ALL of their voices are AMAZINGGGH, but ngl i got so excited when i saw Bangchan and Seungmin😂❤❤
Me, not a fan of Astro, but seeing Moonie makes me tear up but I have to remind myself he wouldn’t want us to be sad, so yes I’m crying sad tears but I’m so freaking proud of him and I wish he got more time with us. I wish all Astro fans keep comfort of him in their hearts bc I know if I was a fan of them, he would’ve been a bias and I can’t bear it. ❤❤❤
2025년에 보러오는 사람ㅋ
All the girls slayed their vocals ESPECIALLY the first one. The guys did amazing as well with their vocals, it was a great lineuppp

2:07 MY FAV PART
Oraciones sobre Música Criolla La música criolla es el alma de las celebraciones en la costa peruana, llenando de alegría cada reunión. El cajón peruano es el corazón rítmico de un vals o un festejo, marcando la cadencia con sus golpes. La guitarra acompaña con su melodía melancólica y vibrante a las voces de los cantantes de música criolla. La quijada de burro, con su sonido de sonaja, añade un timbre muy peculiar y festivo al conjunto. El uso de la cajita como instrumento de percusión menor le da un sabor único a los ritmos más rápidos de la música criolla. Para tocar un buen festejo, es indispensable la sincronía entre el cajón, la cajita y la quijada de burro. El concierto de hoy reunió a grandes maestros de la guitarra y el cajón para honrar el Día de la Música Criolla.

Dude, THAT'S BEST COLLAB EVER
Moonbin😢
우와 예뻐요666666
Rewatching this in 2025 and seeing moonbin makes me so sad😭
I love how all kpop groups come together for such a beautiful performance ❤
ATE
Not me playing this banger in summer💀
문빈보자마자 눈물부터 난다..
I'm obsessed with this. Every group did amazing. And Wendy stands out so much and I love that. Her dress is so pretty and her voice is as well. I think Chan and Seungmin did so well too, their vocals go so well together and I think they were the perfect duo for this. Also enhypen did so well too, I'm obsessed with the soft voices. Also I see astro is in this video so I'm going to say rest in peace Moonbin. You were a beautiful singer and you shined in a way no one else could. Also shout out to Ateez! Obsessed with their vocals as well. But anyways I think all the duos that were picked in the group's were a perfect duo for this. Yeah, I love other members too but the two in the duos work so well together. Also there's just something so heartwarming about all of these bands getting together and doing this. It's so sweet and I'm definitely playing this at Christmas.
Everyone ate
2:07 chans voice unforgettable 😭✨💗

Ready for this Christmas to put this on full blast 🔥🗣️👊🏻
FALTAN 141 DÍAS PARA NAVIDAAAAAAD AHHHHHH STRAY KIDS YEAHHHHHHHH
난 이거 1년에 10번정도 봐야하는 병이 있음
저때 나는 제주도에서 듣고 있었지
I don’t hate them okay
It’s just frustrating how the K-pop used Mariah’s singing techniques to use it to be popular ughh
Mariah Carey copy sorry but the singing is also copy pasted
Watching this as a multistan and after mooning died makes me sad
me in 2025 crying for moonbin 😭😭we will miss you binnie R.I.P 😭😭🕊
AHHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!💗 So many idols from different groups coming together to sing a song!!!😭They all sound heavenly together!!!!🤩
Je ne m'en lasserai jamais
seeing moonbin always makes me cry
실력이 쩌니까 표정이 여유가 넘치고 완전 무대를 즐기는 느낌이다.. 연기시상식 축하무대에 웬디 초청했음 좋겠다 실력 어중간한 가수들 말고
2:07  バンチャン＆スンミン
I smiled when jungwon and Sunoo came ( who watched it in 2025

웬디 혼자 50초 불렀네ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 역시 교수님... 혼자 옷도 파란색이라 단체샷에서 선생님과 아이들이 무대 준비한 거 같음
Seungmin singing is fantastic❤❤❤❤
I STARTED SCREAMING WHEN BANGCHAN AND SEUNGMIN CAME UP-
They were undoubtedly the best of this collaboration(Seungmin &Chan)
STRAYKIDS EVERYWHERE ALL AROUND THE WORLD 🌎🌍🖤❤️🔥🩷💖💕

Every time I watch it I cry because I see Moonbin... We missed you so much
Omg all these amazing voices they sound so frickin beautiful together❤️ i am extremely sad about moonbin, i wish he still here with us… i have been an aroha since about 2018 😢when i heard the news, i was devastated… i couldn’t imagine going through the same pain and grief as i did with SHINee’s Jonghyun which who was my bias since i was a Shawol since 2015 😞 he happen to pass away just before christmas 2017…😢so sad these things has to happen… i can’t wait to meet them in heaven the day i die🕊️❤️🙏🏼
FAZ VERSÃO 2024!!!!!

The fact that I’m watching this in 2024 makes tears come up in my eyes to see all these beautiful groups singing and celebrating Christmas together and being happy together❤❤❤
3:36 Who is the she of the left?
Этот коллаб - легендарный, пересматривая его я сразу ощущаю прилив новогоднего настроения! Грустно только то, что этот коллаб повторить невозможно.. Особенно мне понравилось как спели Чан и Сынмин, из голоса отлично сочетаются, конечно все отлично спели, но все таки они мне понравились больше всего. Всех с Наступающим Новым Годом!! 🎅🎄 (Знаю что рано, хехе)
IT'S TIMEEEEE
YASSSSS THE TIME HAS COME AGAIN RAHHHH
WELL THIS WAS LEGENDARY! 🫶🏻💗
i was watching this in 2024✨ when moonbin came i just removed my headphones is shock and cried in joy 😭😭😭

Natal chegando já tô preparando essa perfeição
But im seeing this now?? I hope in 2024 these idols and other groups will collab again🌸
IM OFFICIALLY OBSESSED❤❤
Bangchan iş so beatiful voice
3:04 AAAAA BOTH OF MY BIASES
I was smiling, until I saw Moonbin 😭😞 (I just want to clarify, I know he wouldn't like to see us sad, but I can't help but feel sad for him and bad for Eunwoo and all the members.)
Watching it November 2024 makes my heart ache. TXT is too busy, they rarely have time for themselves and hybe is facing so much drama. Taeil is a rape suspect, moonbil is gone... 2021 was such a good time. I can not understand what happened...
Moonbin ❤
Is no one gonna talk bout how Hongjoong is a rapper and he SLAYED this, also San looks so freaking good, Chan mate....ARE YOU EATIN VEGEMITE OR SMTH SINCE WHEN DID U SOUND SO GOOD? Also is no one gonna mention Seungmin mate our puppy looked so happy to be there and HIS VOCALSSSSS
this is heavenly
WENDY. YOU CAN FUCKING RIFF.
Wendy main character PERIOD 💙
No por nada el minuto 2:07 es el minuto con mas reproducciones ! skz nunca decepciona,las voces de minnie y channie suenan tan deslumbrantes y magicas❤
We need something like this this year!!!!
2:20 bangchan love youuuuu
CAN WE JUST TALK ABOUT BANG CHAN
I come here for the first time and when i saw moonbin I burst into tears  i don't know how to explain this feeling but it hurt a lot and seeing them all celebrate Christmas together make me happy , i hope they will do it again 😢❤
Вернусь 31 октября🎄🎉🎇
Taehyun literally covering Soobin and Yeonjun's voices 😭😭😭
TXT❤
Sunoo's voice is all I want for Christmas 😭❤️
내가 젤 최근이당
2024년도에도 보는사람
WHO CAME HERE BEFORE THE CHRISTMAS OF 2024?!
We all have to admit that Wendy slayed this so hard
특히 웬디의 경우 절대 피곤하지 마세요. 그녀는 완벽해요
All I want is you mate 😢
Please make another one for 2024 🙏🏻
Watching this in 2024🥲 RIP MOONBIN🙏 😭 This really brings tears to my eyes seeing everyone together❤️
Is anyone watching this after Moobin is no longer here😢?!

my eternal moon 😢
Seungmin and Chan is so good at singing ❤❤❤
SUPER ICONIC
ateez, the boyz and enhypen all comes at the same time 😭
Moonbin...❤
I’m confused why yujin and Liz didn’t do it when Liz if the freaking main vocalist!
우리 슼둥이들ㅠㅠ
SM needs to give Wendy a full christmas album. Her english fluency is just too good to not start utilizing it to western markets.
oh, moonbin..

Winter and Ningningg so cute voice
My gosh, Wendy starting off the song and then TXT coming in with the deeper voices right after just sends me chills. This performance is great. I also think it so interesting how you can hear the different voice textures of each group. I rewatch this all the time, even when it's not Christmas.

우리 빈이 오빠 무대에서 너무 빛나는 사람인데 그 빛이 너무 빨리 꺼져 버려서 너무 맘이 아프네요 오빠 오빠가 벌써 보고싶어요 거기선 건강하고 잠 잘 자고 밥 잘 먹어요 전 여기서 오빠가 남겨준 오빠의 흔적으로 오빠를 충분히 좋아하다가 오빠 만나러 갈게요 사랑해요

Lol SBS Gayo Daejeon tries to make it up to Wendy by letting her wear blue alone in the finale group song - this was her first performance since falling off their misplaced stage step and breaking her cheek, hip and wrist
