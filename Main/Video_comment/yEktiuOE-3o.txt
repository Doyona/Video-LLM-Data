Jennie slapping steven is crazy
Best comedy I've seen in a long time XD LOVE IT
dame'\
This video had me laughing the whole entire time 😂
You joke, but smart blinders would make bank for neurodivergents who need blinders automatically done at certain times and mood if synced to Apple watches. Brightness is overstimulating and makes most of night owls without assistance from screens before bed.
Third one is finally putting simps to good use 😂
Bro we need this part 3

Anyone else hear the clash opening at 2:05 ?
1:25  Crazy
I really need help. I recently found out through Chromosomes & Me  that I’m 100% Caucasian. Understandably I suffered instantly from emotional damage. It turns out my husband shamefully suffers from the same. He is in such a state of emotional damage that we feel we are no longer adequately equipped to raise our 7 failures. Three are triplet failures. Imagine the shame. Can you do a video to give hope to those (really just me) who suffer emotional damage and have a hard time parenting their (my) failures? I may need professional help. I can’t be the only one. I even tried to throw a shoe at my youngest failure but hit our dog, impaling my stiletto heal right in his no-no square. Help!

“ without having to grind for hours” sir I’ve been grinding for 13 hours and I don’t even have a full team of awakeneds
Even better than the 1st one! How is that possible? I swear that I saw that 1 guy in the Ronnie Chiang video when he was in NYC.... I gotta make sure. Not all Asians look the same, dammit!
I'm actually convinced smart window blinds can work and maybe you could even add a screen...   Make them the kind of blinds that have multiple bits so that all the wires can just go through the top or side. Segment screens into the size of said blind and add circuits and screens into them. The wires that go through the top/sides can help syncronize the screens so when it's closed the screens turn on. Then, it can optionally be powered by solar. The solar panel can be a seperate attachment can be hooked onto your window. But as stock, they'd just be hooked up to your power grid adding further electricity bills. Hmmm...  I'm not even joking. I think if the blinds are just thick enough, then they can have screens put into them along with circuits and wires to sync them together. They sounds super pointless, but it's a feasible concept.
i thought blindr was an app for blind people to meet from If Shark Tank was Asian 1
you can tell that smack was personal💀
UNCLE ROGER
we need an entire series of this
I am sapprised that u not have smart slipper yet
Imagine if shark, Tank actually watch this, and they will be like…😢😂😮😅

I think these are genuine reactions. I don't think they knew what the presentations would be.
2:06 bro the supercell intro in the background💀💀💀💀💀💀
I have an idea for one  Have you ever wanted to see how much of a failure your son is I can help with that with the game called the tournament of failures the higher the place they get the more of a failure they are if they get 1st place they are the biggest failure in the world because they play to much games when they could be studying to be a lawyer and if they decide to decline to study instead they are the best at not being a failure and all this for the cheap price of 10 million. (Feel free to use the idear just say Tom came up with the Idear you don't have to tho.)
Uncle Roger said only a couple things and they were hilarious
I love how someone was playing clash royale 2:05
please make a 3rd video
Jeenie laughing in the background when Joma was dressed up as her is gold

If my mom was still here she would definitely be sold on that blindr wand! 😂
Who started playing clash of clans a quarter of the way through
Eddy  from twosetviolin cool
Honestly, $10,000 to be smacked in the face by Steven is a steal.
Honestly right after he got no investments In Blindr, he should've gone to the next slide that said "Future plans" and shown the Blindr 2... And given the exact same pitch and Blindr word for word
XD

1:30 bro aliens be watching
I hate myself for saying this but...the smart blinds actually would be a good idea. They would self adjust depending on the light during the day and close at night. The only real difficult part of making it would be balancing the internal and external photovoltaic resisters....and getting all of the fabulous color options.
1:33 I dunno why but his entire pitch is making me wanna rewatch shaolin soccer
Pls part 3
I need more!! 🧡
Please do shark tank 3

MORE PLEASE MORE
The sad part is, I think the Blindr will actually become a real product, for that exact price, and there'll be plenty of people dumb enough to buy it.

"Can we but our children with it?" "Legally no. *But-* "
OMG it’s Jeenie Weenie
Who’s joma
“I’m such a big fan.” “Yeah, I know.”  *Boom* EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
I love how the entire video was just an excuse to get Joma to crossdress as a sexy flight attendant
"We often have smart homes, smart lights why don't we have smart..."  I could've sworn he was gonna say failures

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funniest stuff I have     watched in forever!!
15 trillion views on an video with 4.7 mil subscribers? That’s 3.191.489,36 x the subscribers
4:46 THE 2 LEGENDS
Blindr must be so good. You can even play Clash Royale from the sounds of it
It would have been better if the price was $6969.69
Aye yo, Joma came to the class without any preparation and presented his old slides!
Was it just me or did I hear clash royale. 😂 😂
Even those violins are there!!!! That was so funny to see them all laigj and have fun together ❤️

4:01 AYO WHAT
I was looking for a comment about the clash royale starting music and i didnt see any
2:05 who da fuk playing clash of clans?
Hahaha! Sad, gross, and funny! HalleluYah! Praise to Yah for your life! Yahuah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth(Genesis 1:1 In the beginning Elohim created the heavens and the earth) and Yah gave His only brought-forth(begotten) Son, Yahoshua ‘Yah is Salvation’ Messiah(John 3:16 “For Elohim so loved the world that He gave His only brought-forth Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but possess everlasting life.) to sweat blood(Luke 22:44 And being in agony, He was praying more earnestly. And His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.) and be brutally murdered on a stake(cross) and be resurrected on the third day for the sins of all of humanity!(1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) (1 Corinthians 15:3-5 For I delivered to you at the first that which I also received: the Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that He was seen by Kêpha(Sha’ul who is also called Paul), then by the twelve.) Follow Yahuah’s 7 easy feast of remembrance and keep Yah’s Sabbath(Day 7; Day of Rest)!   Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’ and His death and resurrection gave us the Gift of the Set-Apart Spirit to be our Guide and Helper to do what is right in Yah’s eyes! Elohim is plural for ‘Mighty Ones’ and Eloah is singular for ‘Mighty One’ and the Arabic word for ‘Elohim’ means ‘Judges and Rulers’   or   ‘Judges or Rulers’! Hallelujah is properly spelled ‘HalleluYah’ which literally means ‘praise to Yah’! Yahshua literally means ‘Yah is Salvation’! HalleluYah! Yahshua is the Messiah! “Jesus” is Greek for ‘hail Zeus’ and ‘Iesous/Iasous’ is four(4) deities/idols/mighty ones names combined, including the ‘Zeus’! ‘Lord’ is Hebrew for ‘Ba’al’ in every real Hebrew translation! “Christ” is the Greek deity/idol/mighty one ‘Christos’! “God” is “god” is “Gade” is “Gad”, “Ghode” is “Gawd” is the Pagan deity/idol/mighty one of “fortune”! Yeshua/Yehoshua when directly translated from Hebrew to English is Joshua! Amen is the Pagan idol Amen-raw/Amon-raw!
Steven he looks exactly like my friend aidan if he were older. Its scary how similar they are
01:05 He almost got me investing until he showed me his demo and I realized he doesn't have the two absolute must  smacks. The Asian Mom Smack and the Eastern European Mom Smack. So for that reason: I am (knocking him) out.
Joma === Steve Job 😂
2:32 to 2:37 that’s what we were when our mother asked to Close the window

Let us repent from our sins and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior one day we will face him and those who doesn't repent from there sins and didn't accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior would be sent to hell for he didn't want God so he will go to place where God is nowhere to be found but the good news is this Jesus has already died for you so you don't have to suffer hell  all you need to do is accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent from your sins you will be saved that Is the good news my friends that salvation is free thats all ask me if your confused at something God bless you,

Here in Brazil we have a word "impagável" to be used when we find something so funny that we just wouldn't stop laughing at.  Means "unaffordable", that's exactly what you are. You are: "impagável" specially you Steven. Only watching it on YouTube and paying you with likes is possible for all the laughing I had.  Btw, you got fans over here too, in case you didn't know about it.
Eric wang 🤣
Can you play the other mobile legends its fun to. you can play with your friends fight your friends in real time. the gems one is so expensive its not free trust me i dont even have one.

I love that Uncle Roger was invited.
The influencer jacket thing is actually probably useful
0:25 - 0:36 now that sound like a good deal
Product idea: Master's degree in influencing, because we know your grandma will respect that more than having 5 million subscribers. Only requirement is having at least 5 million subscribers
Ironic he is using a Mac to talk about window blinds….
They have smart phones and even smart light bulbs how about smart children? Random asian parent who doesnt havee acess to youtube but if they saw this thats wath they would say
Apple 🍎🍎

Yo "smart blinds" are already a real thing.
A Wang of Eric proportions.
Genie is Uncle Roger's new auntie Helen 🤣
I think Steven's dad should have busted out the Beijing corn and he would have totally won shark tank
It's funny how he says the blinds have four different colors and they're just different variations of white 😂😂
Ngl I wish he said "I'm not Steve jobs, I'm steve unemployed"
When my -failure- kids are born, I'll tell them these were the leaders of the Asian countries.

"We get those for free at home." Best sentence spoken.
2:05 supercell noise at the background

#UninventPhysics

Anyone else hear the clash royale music?
SMACK
Me who knows the whole time that shark tank is an Indian show and India lies in Asia
I won't say none of you can act, but the faux jeenie weenie can
Nava ho
Got my Japanese snacks. Thank you.  Do you have Chinese snacks?   These are def the opposite of FAILURES.  But, I thought this was a daily subscription?  I ate all the ones that arrived last month, in one day.  Expecting more the next day. But, zero.  The FAILURE was real, the feeling.  but, finally, some arrived this Monday.  But, none yesterday.  What da hell is going on.  Filipinos make up in family size what you lack
1:47 I thought he was going to say “but why aren’t my children smart”
If Shark Tank was Asian 3:  "We just made a new breakthrough. You know, leh, we always invent the thing that crack the laws of physics. But what if we     Uninvent  Introducing: Physics: Uninvented."  that is my suggestion, you provide examples by walking on water(splashing water on the floor and walking on it) and making a video walking uphill. Both ways. But the video is a poorly animated video because you were running from the irs and threw the camera at them.
Ginie got his weeny cut 😂😂
My disappointment is nonexistent and my day is fixed

2:05 Clash Royale in the background caught me off guard🤣
The clash royale opening music lol
I am satisfied that uncle Roger didn't put leg down
I love how Brett from TwoSetViolin was unamused until the last one about the vloger hoodie!😂😂
When Steven said “This video is sponsored by MLA,” my first thought was “…the format? He got sponsored by MLA Format? How??”

Professional Famous Person😂😂
Bruh really said, NevAho. I love it when people try to pronounce indigenous tribes. Good effort, 8/10.
The uk equivalent of shark tank is Dragon’s den. Im surprised there was no pun taken an asianished for the title. Dragon’s den asian style!
I came here for Eric's presentation. I feel sorry for his programmer/ engineer.
5:35 Me: haha this is funny Uncle Roger: When can Uncle Roger ride your plane? Me: ... ... Me: WHAT
By this video  we can conclude that joma is a gay😂
breaking news, guy gets smacked 1:26
Are you tired of smart phones? Smart watches? Smart TVs? Then let me introduce you dumb technologies, we have dumb phones with self learning AI that would disobey your every instructions, we also have dumb watches that tell you to give up on life instead of telling the time and dumb TVs that doesn't work. We in the not so smart company we don't know what are we doing, we just want some green papers and that's all
Bruh it's just starting and the first line got me "I'm a professional famous person" xD

Steven laughing over the Asian Steve Jobs!!
TWOSETTVIOLIN!!! My favorite musicians!! They never announced they had a collab with you!

I wonder what's for lunch.?
2:06 did i jus hear clash royaleeeeee
HAHAHAHHA EMOTIONAL DAMAGE BY SLAP
I need like a million more of these collabs
When you get physical slap
How do you type?
E
Okay the jacket one! I would by that just to put custom shaped lights like ones that mimic Aang's tattoos and make them glow only when the sun goes down and just walk around, might add a magnetic fibers in a mask too make some custom mask designs too.
me realizing two people look similer: hmmm...
2:49 - 2:54 lmfao! 😂🤣
2:05 mans playing clash royale during a business meeting. respect!

Oh and bring 5 eggs on the way home! *Steven* But they only sell 6 in a pack. *Steven's dad* I don care just get 5 eggs it's not that hard! You so DUM!

OH. MY. GOODNESS!!!! I SWEAR I saw the: **Influencer hoodie**  A LONG time ago back in the late 1980's on a kids invention show entitled: **Dr. Fad**. This kid had a Hoodie with a bunch of Velcro strips attached to it. He used the hoodie in a VERY similar manner as the **Influencer** hoodie here!!!!  Just get a hoodie.. Sew on a bunch of Velcro and attach your other Velcro side to the stuff you need to stick on the Hoodie!!! It's STILL in-genius TO THIS VERY DAY!  ^u^    X - D

Steven is a professional asian.
''you got emotional damage?"  "we have physical damage."  "you got turning red?" "we have turning blue"  "you got I'm going to send you to Jesus?"  "we have I'm going to send  you to Satan"
This was actually funny lmao would love to see more collabs from this group
I laughed so much I forgot I had emotional damage 🥹✨
Did you hear the clash royale tone in 2:07?
i saw you on the dinosaur world movie
I love how someone is playing clash royale in the back round
What’d you do have your cuzin help you with part 2 😂😭
Steven i have a challange for you  I bet you cant do that 😉 Not much you have to film a video in public place and upload that 😂🤣 And that will prove you can become actor💖😘
I think u invented a "make me laugh, Shark Tank Game"!
How did he not use iBlind is beyond me. 🤔
Cringe.
I love your videos man! You do the accent so well. Do you remember Peter Chao? Your vids remind me of him so much lmao. He doesn’t really do the accent anymore 😢 Please never stop brother 🖤 You’re a great comedian and actor 🖤🖤
Shark Tank is actually an American version of a Japanese show called Money Tigers. There is also a Chinese version of the show called Chinese Partner.
Lol do the family guy shark tank scene
okay but that influencer jacket was actually pretty cool though
jeenie weenie 😍 lmao 🤣🤣🤣
Steven He: Can I… Beat My Children with it? Salesman: Well… Legally no, But If that Means Investing in My Company, You can do what you want!
Do if Star Wars is Asian
I am surprised Uncle Roger isn't trying to sell you MSG.
5:35, Ayyyyyy. Uncle Roger trying to shoot his shot. 😅. For free tickets of course. 😉. Love this video. Hilarious throughout.
I would love many more collabs
“Can I use it to beat my children?
the second one missed an opportunity. "now we have smart phones, smart homes, even smart lightbulbs.  but why aren't my children smart?"
Do one about watching white people shop in a predominantly asia grocery store.lol
OMG all my favrouite Sian utubers are doing a COLLABORATION
GIVE US PART 3 AND LET UNCLE ROGER GO ON STAGE
The Influencer jacket is actually not a bad idea. 👍
Did anyone heard clash royal or clash of clans strat up screen in 2:05
This is the best video on the internet period.
steven he: went from funny asian jokes man to emotional damage man
0:31 where the hell is my slap I paid and even bought Beijing corn
React to the vegan teacher
"Do you guys know influencers..?" Nathan, I think we found a possible candidate for another copy of the "Your Cousin" product.
this is like a game show
It seemed like Jeenie was forced to laugh
Wth now he knows mobile legends. I prefer mlbb than mla but its the same the mla one is a anime a look like

You should also do a collar with Ian Boggs.
Make a porody of ace atorney
0:35 *I'd like to buy your entire stock.*

Can we hit our children Since when did broke people were able to afford kids?
Wow it’s so surreal swing him at 4mil I still remember when he was at 200k it felt like it was just yesterday
Uncle Roger made an unexpected appearance
I think they should add a Steven he hero it’s a very op hero his attack emotional damage deals emotional damage and also slap move and slap and back hand slap and failure last move is the I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS slipper
3:38 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂(in my opinion)
*EMOTIONAL DAMAGE GUY GETS SMACKED* *15 trillion views*
Is that Asian Steve jobs
DON BE A DIK
This is so funny Steven.
Ashish 's shark tank vid. is 100 times better
India is in asia and there is a thing called shark tank india
This is just a test to see if you reply. If you do, make yourself comfortable.
Not bad but the last obe was waysss betters
Joma did best😂
mate you can create an app with a soundboard about sertain things you say such as "I will send you to jesus", "emotional damage!" and "what the hell you say to me"
Holy moly you shot in subscribers you can almost past everyone here. Just need 1 more million and you can pass uncle roger.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Uncle Roger is the only one who's acting correctly.. Others are failures. Laughing at the smallest thing, not authentic at all. So white
Emotional damage
Person: *promoting their product* Steven: Can I beat my children with it
I would watch hours of this
Steven: I’m a big fan. Jennie Weenie: (Hair flip)I know.
I HVE A QUESTION  whos funnier: Uncle Roger or Steven he
actually my teacher ms angelica is uncle roger cousins:)
very profecenal very accurate
THIS IS HILARIOUS 😂
Just some constructive critisicm, i think this would be way more funny if you just stayed in character, you know without all the laughtet
Supercell at 2:06
New vid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I absolutely LOVE that Two Set Violin is there 😍😄😂
Jennie weenie really has a weenie
We need more of this, this is peak content, this entire channel is peak content.
The only way Stevens dad will stop calling Steven a failure is if Steven uninvents physics
Lol.
Do part 3 pllz
Omggggg the attractive comment got me bad 😂😂 4:34
Mmmm wait a minute..isn't the last one just a lighting/ cameraman put together.. oh wait that just dudes on onlyfan selling their girlfriends 🤣
Is it just me or was someone playing clash of clans in the background
Did I hear Clash royal at 2:07?!?!?!?!?!
These Chinese.... Ohh... Everywhere
E for EMOTIONAL DAMAGE F for FAILURE I for I WILL SEND YOU TO JESUS
You look like shang chi
That smack tho
I like thus Asian gang a
But What if Shark Tank was Asian 1? I have never seen Asian 1 people.
These Asian crossovers are legendary. The fact how they make their sales pitches by themselves
Very good
"Sperm White"
3:54 🥵
2:05 I love how somebody just open a super cell game 😂🤣
This was actually hilarious
Whyyyy joma tech, just focus your startup 😅
Emotional damage.
JeenieWeenie looks a bit different today…
We need @Steveioe here to resuscitate the contestants from the emotional damage
Steven is a failure
4:30 ok i want one of these. this might actually be useful for real
Are u Chinese?
Are u Chinese?
are u from India or China say
I was expecting "Can you do middle hand" from someone that would have got my ass on the floor and seeing you being confused would send me to Jesus 😂
LOL
I like how Joma did not break his character. It must be tough
This needs more Asians - Indian/Pakistani/Srilankan/Bangladeshi! Come on Steven - such a dissapointment.
"professional famous person"
Uncle Roger never laughs and his jokes are just KILLER. The last joke of his burst me laughing lol
I can cook oneminute rice in 57 seconds
Not great. I don't understand why people do MLA formatting.
Brett is with his cooler older brother
Love this, but somebody needs to cut off the AC while y’all film!
Why are they wearing shoes inside? That’s like the first rule of being Asian
Ayo someone playing clash royale bro fr 😭😂 2:05
The people of shark tank: What’s that- ITS THE ASIAN GANG, SURRENDER  What can I say? Asian parents are dangerous especially if they have a shoe.
i died at 3:51, legitimately havent laughed that hard in a long time
The Great council of Asians
2:06 who is playin Clash Royale in the background?????
OMG, I love that Joma continue his enterprise of Blinder from his "A Day in the life of an engineer working from home" sketch LOL And the imitation of Steve Jobs is spot on LOL
i want more\
Not gonna lie the influencer jacket is actually KINDA INGENIOUS.
Erik wang so subtle. Hahah
You hear Mobile Legends Adventure, I hear MLA format
I NEED FOR OF THIS
I feel like I have been so sad lately, but this made me smile when I thought it was impossible. Thank you<3
2:07 SUP ERC ELL
I have a question is this filmed in somebody’s home? Because real Asians don’t wear shoes in the house 😡  Edit: I love your videos
I need this group to live together and make me laugh everday.  Asian's ain't funny eh? Sorry...absolutely wrong.  These guys are absolutely amazing.
😂😂😂😂
Crap!!!....this.....this....this is.....this is too asian!!!......I...I can't handle anymore!!!!
You can beat them...at the game of life
Steven he is on a movie
Is someone playing clash Royale in the video😂?
Clash royal 2:06 : Hi🙃
I was so ready to yeet my phone thinking the vid was sponsored by mla citation 😂🥲
*IT'S THE BLINDS FROM ''WHAT'S WRONG WITH SECRETARY KIM?''!*
Where do i get the tickets?
*BRUH, even Uncle Roger joined in on the shenanigans. I'm dead.* 😂😂🤣🤣😭😭💀💀☠☠
I love how Uncle Roger is just chilling there the whole time and only speaks when he has a zinger to get everyone giggling.
1% Emotional  99% emotional damage
1:42 the way he was stopping his laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣
amoguz
IM JK IM JK I SWEAR DONT SMACK THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME PLS
i love how the girl is the only one whos kinda happy lol (you know what i mean)
wait, bro twosetviolin is in this...
After the "The block the sun" I expected Steven to say something like "oh finally, something to block son, he such disgrace"
My kid now says, Emotional Damage if she spills something or falls down 🤣🤣🤣🤣 and now wants me to say, what the haaaaaiiiil a lot 🤣🤣so my kid will purposely drop something or bump me so I can say that 🤣🤣🤣
2:18 love how nathan is just there staring blankly
Man's made this vid and Dave became a super backer
'have you ever wondered why we have smart phones smart homes and heck even smart light bulbs' but nobody ever asked why we don't have smart children
damn that advanced tech jacket is actually good
I gave my mom and dad Emotional Damage. Because of your tutorials. Thanks.
2:05 which chad did enter clash royale🤣🤣
Only for a cheap 10,000 dollars u can get the crap smacked out of you
3:45 Genie Weenie Won this One 🤣🤣
I hear cr 😳
I love these colabs
Bruh someone opened clash royale in the middle of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I like how everyone is just talking about the CLAsH ROyAlE aT 2:05 when you scroll by new
When are you doing your next video in Cadmen plaza
2:05 was that the clash royale loading screen sound
Who started playing Clash Royale 😭😭😭😭
5:35  why does uncle Roger wanna ride Joma's plane?
who started clash royale in the bg?
The sunglasses 💀
Bad sound
"When did Jeenieweenie become so attractive" "You just look like Tron now"  Nigel really bringing his A game during these collabs
I'm now convinced this is unrehearsed to have them have a natural reaction to how stupid funny the pitches are. Greatest collab ever hand down. 10/10 would invest
Ah yes. My favourite episode of Shark Tank.
I'm disappointed. Needs better audio.
finally the biggest collab among asians has happened
Thank you, I needed to start this crazy work day. So funny, great and entertaining as always.
2:05 the clash Royale music🤣
Dude's got 15trillion+ views but yet stuck on 4.73m subs. Emotional Damage!
Collab with uncle Roger?
*2:04* someone be playing CR
U can control the characters and unlock them
If u play mla play mlbb
Please don't tell me there's a part 3 sir...
Best series yet
Do u got 8 mile? No but we gut 6 Kilometer
comedy
Yay more of these hahahaha
ah yes. jeenie weenie and two set violin.
I need a part 3     with Ryan Higa
Clash Royale noises in the background
Mlbb
Video idea: if an Asian plays Baldi’s basics
LOL. EVERYONE SHOULD SUBSRIBE!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Legally, no"
I’m laughing so hard
I could track you down
Joma Tech isn't acting.  He is actually an entitled stuck up doofus
5:11 The SASS.
4:34 I CAN’T 😂🤣🤣🤣
You look like Shang chi hero
Are Asians allowed to hang out with other races or is that against the rules?
I didn't have breakfast or lunch but this definitely filled me with joy.😊 I thank everyone involved in making this clean and pure fun video. I send much love and appreciation 😍❤️ super fun and funny to watch.
When he said sponsored by MLA, I thought he was talking about the format
But we're Asian, if we squint, we see straight through Venetian blinds!
Hiring someone famous to smack you is actually a pretty good way to get attention, but only if you're also famous. Otherwise, the articles would just be "[Name of famous person] smacks innocent bystander" with no info on who you are
I'm glad to see silly skits being made on YouTube. This is what the site was all about back in the day.
This series has been very enjoyable!
2:05 random Clash Royale
Nice, Asian people are trying to move into the Jewish market
Ok but the influencer hoodie is a great idea for real LOL
"Hello. I am a professional famous person"   At least that's what I heard
Why was there a clash royal loading sound
they had to flex"49 million combind followers:
Knock off wish Jeenie Weenie
Anyone else heard the clash of clans start up 🤣 couldn't hide it from me
Best. Crossover. Ever.
This doesn't feel realistic, they all have shoes on
Asian Shark Tank? More like Failure Management: the game show!  This is going to cause someone EMOTIONAL DAMAGE (DAMNIT), I can tell.
I wonder if the wand clones your brain if does than there will be 2 failures
Blindr sounds like a dating app for people that are attracted to blinds.
Not your best video. Kindof boring.
“… Format?” Sry I paused the video at the beginning and that’s all I thought..
I love her Steven always read our comments!
DAAAAAAAAMN I just got a wisdom tooth removed and watched the first minutes where you sell your idea "smacked by famous person", I think I gotta return to my dentist real quick, couldn't resist laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Clash Royale 😂 2:00
Only if it was funny
One of the Sharks: how come Jeanie.weenie became so attractive? EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!!
When Nathan Doan ging ging coming back lol.
hi there jenny omma!😍😍she came all the way from canada?
“When can uncle roger ride your plane” -Uncle roger  My new favorite quote
I'm looking for the Beijing Corn version of Blindr, last seen on the Influencer Hoodie site. Anyone remember how much it was? XD
Just looked it up! Smart blinds are real!
go check out his movie if u all haven't Dinosaur World
15 trillion views?  What does his father have to say about that?
PART 3!!
Steven he:slap by famous person  Me:your  The Famous Person
clash royale in the bakcground... sus..but supercell i will accept...bam ba ba ba ba bam

I'm not Steve Jobs  We know       Ur Asian Steve Jobs basically same thing now give me a smart window and blind and cheese
That accent makes me laugh every time 😂😂😂 Thank u Steven's dad
1:27  LIVE           BREAKING NEWS:          EMOTIONAL DAMAGE GUY GETS SLAPPED
I want to be asian !!!!!!
1:27 SLAP
0:13 SLAP
Hi
If shark tank was Asian 3 needs Taipei corn (Taipei is the capital of Taiwan 🇹🇼 which is a country that is not recognized by China 🇨🇳 and China’s capital as you know is Beijing)
Dam he was right I love this channel yet when I saw that smack I paused the video to give a thumbs up XD
2:05 LMAO THIS REMINDS ME OF MY CLASSMATE WHO BLASTED THE SUPERCELL INTRO ON FULL VOLUME DURING CLASS LMAO
DID ANYONE ELSE HEAD THE CLASH OF CLANS THINGS AT 2:05
Did Dave Chapelle just invest? Cus it seems this just happened.
Damn jeenie got HOT AF
It makes it so much better that they break character imo lmao
BEST CROSSOVER 💯💯💯
I'm waiting for 2 set violin to sell their ling ling master class...
3:15 Steve Jobless / Alex Management
Someone on that clash royale grind @ 2:05
Asian collaboration never gets old.
1:25 15 TRILLION views in 2 months. Who needs a slap?
did i just hear someone start up clash of clans  💀
mobile legends is the original game is way bettwr
Pro your video made me watch more then 10 ads you have to pay me 66% back of the profit or I will call uncle Roger
I've seen a bunch of your videos, Steven, but this one got me to sub to you. MAKE MORE!!!!!
I’d invest in Eric Wang’s Idea. Not only can I use it to block failures I can also beat the daylights outta them. The Walmart version of Winder shall be Steven He’s idea.
@2:05 somebody playing clash royale in the back AHAHAHAH
“My fellow asians, I introduce yet another form of severe emotional damage” ah yes, the side-hand! 😎
You got me at the part of 15,501,412,501, 542 views the last time I checked we were only 7.4billion in the whole world but I guess that slap got the attention of aliens and awoke our ancestors... classic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Welcome to emotional damge co we jave emotional damege,emotion damge bag, emotional electic scotter/car/bycical,we also have emotional mother

Do you think you'd be able to get ryan higa to do skits like this as well
I really hope there’s a part 3 because we haven’t seen Two Sets’ presentation yet.
Wooooooo mobile legends lesss goooooooooooooooo (Filipino here)
That last product feels like will actually be on the show
OMG!! I just got emotionally damaged after watching this!! I need the Blind 2.0 to block me from all this damage!! Hahaha. Freaking Hilarious!
What if the difficulty mode was i will send you to Jesus
*steven! if you ever see this, i hope there will be a part 3.* 😂✨
4:15 Asian TRON
This is the benefit of being asian. So much comedy
2:05 Who the hell playing Clash Royale during the skit?
1:06 "You can get The Classic, The Backhand-"  Uncle Roger : "But we get them free at home" _"True, but your father not famous, bro."_
1:24 "Emotional Damage Guy Gets Smacked" _I guess it's not just EMOTIONAL DAMAGE anymore, is it Mr. He ???_
2:04 who playing clash in the background
next time get plainrock124
I'd watch this. I loved watching "Shark Tank"! This'd be hilarious and entertaining both at the same time Steven. https://tvovermind.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Shark-Tank-Meme-5.jpg 🤣
UNCLE ROGER AGAIN!!! Yes, I'm fan of his. lol
My name is Steven believe meets at least even even though you see that day that's my big brother's account
This guy is funny and amazing
WDYM " WHEN CAN UNCLE ROGER RIDE YOUR PLANE"??!?!!
this is the only thing i can watch in public and not get judges
I don’t know why, but I was waiting for a “Steven Unemployed” joke
Jeenie Weenie's husband should actually make a channel hes so funny and looks like he can be rlly sucessful
where you in the movie dinosaur world in 2020 though
3:27   Eric Wang broke Emotional Damage guy's accent
Love your vids they are so funny love the Asian  Voice it makes it ten times funnier 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hope their is a part 3 with 2set products
clash of clans sounds 2:06
2:50 I lost it!
Uncle Roger needs to present one!
Keep doing these collabs they are amazing
you already have an emotional damage product, now make one of i will send you to jesus please
But…. Smart blinds do exist n even open on a schedule
The "Breaking news Emotional Damage guy gets smacked " literally killed me 😂
does "the emotional damage guy" respond?
Who started up Clash Royal in the start of the video? 💀
Anyone else notice clash royals intro at 2:04?
OH MY GOD IT'S BEAUTIFUL i didnt know this could happen, but boy am i glad it did
Prediction: Joma is going to have some sort of flashback to this as we continue the saga of Eric Wang and Blindr on his channel...  Mark my words!
Johnny’s product was a maybe a success
Your akinator picture changed...captures the essence of failure
The Blindr 3.0 will come in clear, water, and window colors.
i just watch dinosaurs world i has a good story i like it and after watching i remember you told us about a movie your in and the female got fired and you took over i see it in this movie.......she is ahhh failure
Hmmmmm, now I'm thinking of buying a "smacked by a famous celebrity" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Joma is a Legend.
when did jeenie weenie get this attractive OMG UNCLE ROGER HAHAHAHA
The tie-in from Joma Tech’s Interview sketch was unexpected
I am most popular in class because I m really good at saying what the hell you say
When did jeenie weenie become so attractive . Lmao ded
This keal me 🤣🤣🤣
What failures. All of them having their own businesses selling their products while true successful people have Asinesses.
When he says influencer  In Steven dads mind  FAILURE
bad audio
Its officiallll Gamersupps collab with the amazing Steven " Failure" He and we will taste pure unadulterated emotional damage 👌🏾👌🏾🔥🔥🔥
Do you know influencers 🤣🤣
83k person to like this video lol!!!!😁😘🤣😂
Uncle Roger to jeenie weenie "When can uncle Roger ride your plane?" (Sorry children)  Uncle Roger just being himself is gold.
Who’s playing clash royale in the backround 😂😂😂
Only very few people can produce so much fun out of spontaneous trash. You’re Geniuses👍👍
THAT SUIT! WOW. lol
The hoodie is actually a good idea...
ECONOMIC RESET IS COMING. THE MONEY YOU HAVE WILL BE SOON AS WORTHLESS AS LEAVES BLOWING IN THE WIND... COVID 19 AGENDA . ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED IS THE NEXT STEP. THE TIME WILL COME YOU WIL BE "FORCED" TO TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST. YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT IT. YOU TAKE HELL ON EARTH IS COMING INTO YOUR LIFE. GODS JUDGEMENT, AND THROWN DIRECTLY INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOR ALL ETERNITY' GOD PROMISES TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU. THIS TRUTH CONFIRMS THAT THIS WAR IS SPIRITUAL, AND NOT NATURAL. JESUS CHRIST LOVES YOU, AND CAN HAVE ETERNAL SALVATION IN HEAVEN, AND NOT HELL.  JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK IN MY LIFE TIME.....
I just won an argument we was watching dinosaur world and I was like holy shit that is the guy that is the face of Beijing corn everyone in my house thought I was crazy I won a $50 bet thank you Stephen he
Cousin got sponsored by msg, do better.
Who's the woman in blue? I love her immediately and don't even know what she does lol. She's always so supportive 😆
Instead of shanghai beans or Beijing corn,shehnzen toaster
Professional famous person...smack variety....I can't😄 #subscribed
is it just me or there is a clash royale sound at2:10 to 2:17
indian shark tank exists technically asian
this needs to be an actual 30 min episode
Does it come with , "I will send you to Jesus" smack?
The clash royale intro in the background makes the video ×1000 better
Yes sirr
MLA I love this game used to play it deleted it cause of lag.  But it's a great idle game and the arts and character design are top tier especially Hanabi.
Oh my God I laughed so much and man joma 🤣😂
2:05 NOT THE CLASH ROYALE OPENING SOUND
I would buy Beijing corn if it was a real product lol
I will highly look forward to buying it for £10,000
Hey! Did anyone else notice the beginning of the Clash of Clans theme song play at 2:03
So great! Asian
“Can I use it to beat my children?”
https://youtu.be/5LLoi3sseFo✨
me woh reeds at the firs only mobile legends and hear mla thinks mobile legends asia
Shark Tank was originally Asian (The Tigers of Money on NTV).
own gut is utterly hilarious
What the hail
The studio light makes him look like a toilet
249.99$ only Chinese people knows 叫别人 250 🤣
Nice
ayo i just realised someone was playing clash royale at 2:05
it pains me to see that this video is the only reason some ppl are finding out about nathan doan and uncle roger 😫
no bueno
Isn't that the CEO of failure management and Beijing Corn who raised a donut and can't return it back because he can't find the receipt?
Is that ryan higa with the turtle neck? Damn he's old
you know when he started talking about smart homes I was like "Here it comes why arnt our children smart."  and i was made sad because there was no emotional damage : (
https://youtu.be/GVsn309Vfa4 Watch this video, which is similar to stevenHe’s content, funny AF 🤣

Hi
Wait a minute I feel like that influencer jacket would sell
Bts collab so amazing.
Their brain cells died after this video
Id like to propose a fantastic product to the panel, after much deliberation, it has been named the 9v Battery, instantly stops the screams of pesky plastic circles inside the home, no longer can your son use that as an excuse for his failing grade of B+. Not only that, if your son attempts to be a failure, you may try to reboot the failure son system by inserting this battery into mouth. Discomfort and distaste is normal and means it is recharging and rebooting your failure. And for a limited time this product can be available with a free gift! A free can of Shanghai Potatoes! It makes the perfect paperweight for all that money you will make by investing in this product!
4:10 I feel like this would be an actual Shark Tank pitch.
Smack u out of ** Love u man ur amazing 😍😍
nathan stood serious the whole vid lol (almost)
Man that 2:04 clash royale intro distracted me
TWOSETVIOLIN
Mobile legends > mla
Never knew you were in dinosaur world!?!?
Youtube Algorithim be like: Ooooh new Steven He vid, put that in trending for gaming.
Chris Smith looks like 1:25 AHAHAHA 15T viewss that's damnnnman😆
when he said it blocks the sun my brightness turned down because my phone was 5% lol
acctually there is a shark tank show in Vietnam
Everyone is wearing lapelle mics, but why is the audio voice quality so bad? Like the voice quality sounds distant, not very clear, and has super echos
i have a friend called eric wang
Who tf played clash royale in the background?
Joma is the best
i love JOMA !!!!!!!!!!!11
Eric Wang: Blindr 2.0 is coming out! Steven He: Can I beat my children to death? Eric Wang: Legally you can't... Steven He: Doesn't here any more* You can't tell me what the hail to do Also Steven: Thinking of ways to torture his kids with it*
Jeenie Weenie Watching Jeenie Weenie moment
Where is gong ging
1:50 literally aperture science sales rep
Anyone else heard the supercell intro at 2:05
This was one of the greatest videos ever
the coc sound 😭
I know we shouldn't compare but damn uncle roger is so much funnier than the others, who themselves are pretty funny.
Eric WANG  Jeannie WEINEE
I love it but why is the audio so bad 😭
Threeeeeeeeeeeee I want pt 3 threeeee
"Hello i am uhh professional famous person"  - Steven He
Nathan is soooooo confused at first
yoo do the sponsor mlbb
And this is the beginning of the slap 3
No one going to mention the Clash start up sound at 2:05?
great Eid gift
Uncle Roger is the best
Lol
I have a question about the white blinds if you have a apple computer why would you have window
Smat
Where did Nathan Go
"When can uncle Roger ride your plane"  Uncle Roger is so thirsty all the time XD
I love your channel keep up the great stuff
Ohmygod a sequel this early, really?!?!?
Will “asian parent” Smith
Welcome to the collaboration we know we didn't deserved but needed
I introduce to you... the letter S, it's like an A but better so when your failure gets an A+ it's still not good enough because it's not an S. Most places don't recognize S as a grade but that makes it even better for making your failure feel useless. And the best part, is your failure gets an S you can just add ANOTHER S to make it not good enough because they didn't get an SS.
I want failure 😂😂
Guess what it is 😂
Can u also bring Jay from "Jay and Sharon " he is a really nice YouTube are you should really bring him in the next part  .search it on YouTube
Uncle Roger 100% all in
MLA is great and all but sometimes my professors want APA
All these videos have convinced me is that Nigel is just uncommonly savage every moment of the day
#7 for gaming 😂😂😂😂
2:06 whos playing clash royale
Uncle Roger maintaining his role is Gold 🥇
2:04 Why can I hear the Clash Royale opening sound
Hi
LMAO
shark tank India always op
If you listen Joma's pitch, in the background there is clash royale music?
Cannot get enough of these collaborations.  Fuiyoh! btw, when can I get the Blindrs?
I'm laughing because you're laughing 😃
2:06 who’s playing clash royale
Hi
The clash Royale intro at 2:05 had me dying lmao
actually, i literally saw smart blinders at both home depot and lowe's recently.
Don't know if you see this, but the Nathan Doan and Jeenie Weenie links both give a 404 error
If Shark Tank was Asian it would be called Squid Tank.
You smack me in 4K, I'll get Emotional Damage. Omg best influencer (husband) suit ever! I want!
“Why is Steve Jobs talking about windows” Best quote! Go Eddy!
Omg love you're videos hope to see yall again
mọi người cười đẹp quá không chịu được ✨🙉
Ngl, Joma got a great pitch. $249.99 for window blinds with [machine learning technology] sounds like a steal! But my Asian blood is telling me to bargain for it. Would a single chopstick be a fair trade?  Tell Steven's Dad that you can make or break his son's acting career with this one chopstick. And when you snap it in half, it becomes a set of tiny drum sticks. Tie a string on one end of each stick, and you get tiny nunchucks to arm your invisible cat with.     Joking aside, nondisposable chopsticks are sturdier than they look. Please don't actually try to snap them, lol.
Steven he the Jimmy Fallon of asian comedy
use me as a dislike button
Why isent Ryan higa here???
Did anyone else hear the clash of clans intro at 2:06 😂
That shit was funny
There is one Indian shark tank
nice one
DAmn where can we buy the hoodie influencer
So nobody is going to talk about how at 2:07 someone was playing clash Royale
omfg I remember watching this guy back when he had like 30,000 subs, then I sort of stopped paying attention for a long while and now my mans is pushing 5 mil!
Nice glasses
OMG!! kkkkkkkkkkkk
A greater crossover than the Avengers.
2:06 who was playing clash Royal 😂🤣🤣
They are already asian.
I want to order smack from famous person
"can i use it to beat my children"
Where is MxR Plays
The most ambitious crossover since the last most ambitious crossover
I'm Surprised That This Video Is Sponsored By MLA And Not MLBB Which Is More Famous...
i miss ryan higa
to beat children
Get these Down-syndrome looking heathens off my feed
Awesome video, these inventions are always great
There's more? Let's goooooooo.
"We get that for free at home." 😂
Bruh Joma 💀
steven: can i use it to beat my children?  uncle roger: what the hail?! we use wooden spoon to beat children!
at a small price of $249.99 uncle roger: if you call that small, then you should call your small brain huge!
I love your vids but I wish you post more often
Shark tank? Nah. More like Koi tank
“For a cheap 10 thousand dollars, I will come to your house and smack the sh’t out of you”  -Steven He This got me dying! Can’t wait for part 3!
It’s giving impractical jokers vibes.
Amazing.
Does this make it... phYsical DAmage

Lol nobody could keep from cracking up laughing. I heard back handing ends laughter instantly and makes you richer
Steven never fails to make us laugh 😁.
Are we gonna ignore the Clash Royal theme at 2:05
This one was UNHINGED
Dayuuum Joma is getting some muscles

That hoodie look sick 😂
Pewdiepie would instantly double the subscribers in that room good lord
Shouldnt be called shark tank for asians, should be called koi pond
"When did Jeenie Weenie become so atractive?" 🤣
"For a cheap 10,000 dollars. I will come to you house and slap the out of you." This is how boomers hop on trends
Day one of trying to get a heart from Stevan He
"hello. I am a professional famous person." if only steven could be this professional
https://youtu.be/c8EmiVhFaVw
Did I hear a clash royale intro
You forgot being smacked by a spatula, and pro-wrestling chops on the chest.
I started laughing at «professional famous person » 😂😂

“How to be Asian” guidebook plzz
OMG! This was soooo funny! 🤣🤣🤣

2:04 did I hear the supercell game sound?
shut up and take my money
I missed dis
Eric Wang automatically wins because of the Steve Jobs turtleneck sweater.
When he mentioned the different kind of slaps, I thought he was going to mention the Will Smith Slap.
For the second pitch, Blindr, I bet Setevn's dad would question why he can't have smart kids.
I laugh so damm hard when he said we rehearse this
2:05 The first time I heard this, I thought clash royale opened on my phone
OMG it's Uncle Roger ahhh
Bro I heard someone play clash of clans at 2:04
i really thought steven he and uncle roger were the same people.... before you say anything its not because of them being asian its cause they kind of wear the same color shirt... and the fact that they are both asian
05:53 Cue purple lights... "Sorry children"
I did the math. If someone were to actually get 15,501,412,501,412 views on their video, EVERY person on the world would have to watch it 2,215 times.
Been playing mba for years. Great game i really recommend it ^^
this is actually fucking epic
2:18 did he just "Jeb Bush" them??? Hahahaha
Why is this trending under gaming
#43 trending for gaming

Comedians making other comedians laugh! Also a great way of connecting with other Asian comedians across the pond. Don’t stop making these collabs, I’m just enjoying these way too much.

i started watching you before 1 mil and its amazing how you have grown love your vids
Oh Lord, a roomful of  FAILURES.  How come Asian nerds get sexier the more of them there are in a room together?  OUTSTANDING FAILURE, WELL DONE
This video is sponsored by *MLA format*
Failure. Not even 5m Subs, come back when you get a Doctors PHD ((or when you win the lottery))
Hes back with the sharktank!
Very funny good content
Why won’t the code work this was posted yesterday so did it expire?
They are tooooo funny
What is name of music in the beginning
Loving the consistency. Let's hope it doesn't end...
Finally a part 2.. This is the best part about being Asian.
WOO! We got part 2!
This channel will create movies but add this twist and more, and will slowly sell out movie componies
I like the way they randomly change positions on the couch.  Ok...my pitch for a show.  Uncle Roger, Nick Giodavgionaininini or however you spell it, Guga, with CPQ doing Italian restaurant and food review skits, with Steven as his dad as the host.  Nick and Guga would compete with each other at different food compitions where Uncle Roger would judge them.  I have a little pull in LA, but at the same time, I am a canceled person.  Formerly known for extreme videos and music.  You get canceled twice...it makes you think twice about even trying.  And my new art and music would get me canceled faster than ever.  I think I did some of my newest works out of spite.  I turned my basement into an art gallery out of spite.  If a burglar broke into my basement...they would scream and run away.  Framklin and the Bin Twitches would be looking at them crossways and the Watcher...an owl with real guns and a twin blade swivels his head to movement.  It is a cool thing I found at a flea market.  This owl statue that has it's head on a pedalum with magnets that somehow detects movement and will look where the movement is.  It is actually meant to scare off birds.  I gave him real guns and a viking hat.  The guns are not loaded...he has no hands.  Lolz.
3:46 was the best part
The brett erasure from these thumbnails 😭
I love the colab with Uncle Roger!
Believe me or not, in Vietnam there is actually Shark Tank, just a bit too serious.
I of course know Uncle Roger...best food critic ever...the violin twins, and of obviously Steven...need to look up the rest.
2:05 did someone open Clash Royale?
I use my trap card, Steven He’s dad. This card will allow me to counter all of your other cards attack with the side affect of *E M O T I O N A L D A M A G E* which will take away your health points due to you being such a *failure* for every damage you try to inflict on me or my cards
I love how this is #40 on trending for gaming, but has nothing to do with gaming; besides the sponsor. 😂
I love how the first buisness idea is always related to violence ✨😭
Bring PT 3 ASAP
Uhm yes professional famous Person
I can’t be the only one that heard the supercell intro sound at 2:10
To see asian shark tank just watch indian shark tank especially  shark Ashneer , he is the most asian shark there .
Failure!!!
#16 for trending in … _gaming_ ?

Do Arena of Valor next. Build up some tension between the brands. That'd be quite fun.
I realized that I heard the clash Royale sound. And loved how Steven makes these funny series
This is why i like asian adults Always asking if a certain object can be used to beat up children  I love your work mr Steven
YESS ANOTHER VIDEO OF THEM, btw Steven he thank you for hearting my comment , big big fan. Atleast I'm not going to be sent to Jesus XD

#39 on trending for gaming. definitely a gaming video. but...if that's true...  THEN I SHOULD BE SMELLING FAILURE
'emotional damage'
Who's in the blue shirt? Looks SO Professional & comfortable in front of a camera... I think I might have seen her in stock photos somewhere. Her expressions are amazing  And a few links in description didn't lead to desired yt channels.

We even got studio lights! His face: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM BURNING
When SHE said "WE REHEARSED THIS" out loud i laughed as hell 🤣 I'd like to invest in Stevens dad's business , gonna buy 3 time slap for my friends birthday 🎉 🤣
This should be a YouTube original show
One more time, Vietnam have Shark Tank, so stop this Joke.
2:05 Who's playing Clash Royale at this time?? XD
It does not have 15 million views but it may as well has 15 million views
"you got Samsung?"  "we got paulwrote"  "(throws hat on the ground) pauuuulwrote????"  "you got PlayStation 4?"  "we got workcentre 8"  "you got beats?"  "we got beaten"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
"For only $10 thousand dollars, I will come to your house and smack the bleep out of you!"🤣🤣🤣

That some investment 🤣🤣
Joma killed it
did anyone else hear the clash royale opening theme being played at 2:04 or was i hallucinating?
“This video is brought to you by” me starts double tapping
:)
When you came up with the figure 49M combined followers, did you factor in the concurrent followers that subscribe to all of your respective channels?
"Can I use it to beat my children" - Steven He Do you even have children?
joma !! i am yelling!
Of course ML would start sponsoring....... its only a matter of time for Montoon I guess.
Emotion damage
I'd love a version without the background music 🙂
Who da hail wanted to play Clash Royale 2:04?
You should add a professional rickroller in shark tank as an  entrepreneur in part 3 but you have to find a way to not get copyrighted.                                                       never gonna give you up never gonna let you down
Mlbb is better...
As soon as he said "one more thing" the video started to buffer
That view count after the Slap seems accurate.
Nice I loved all the humor in this vid it was so funny it looked like u died when she smacked you.
I was drinking pepsi and and my floor is wet
I can’t stop laughing at 1:28. Face of Beijing corn under attack 🤣🤣❤️
If you see this comment you are a ledgend!
Steven - "Does it look like Jeenie Weenie got a new haircut?" Steven's Uncle - "When did Jeenie Weenie become so attractive?" 😂😂
This is top tier comedy
is it just me or did I heard somebody play clash royale?
Guaranteed way to “whip” your children’s grades into shape.
The hoodie is an actual genius product imo
please start calling the If Shark Tank Was Asian Season 1 Episode 02  I will be your #1 one dollar patreon supporter
2:19 Emotional Damage please
When "Jeenie Weenie" went up she should have went "True Tales From The Skies! Part 3. Let's Go!"
2:07 someone opened clash royale :|
Did anyone notice that when Steven got slapped it said 4.73m subs but now he has 4.88m
I haven't seen them sponsoring their actual game
How dare they be on shark tank judging other people, when they are all FAILUUURREEE??? 😂
Best part is the blinder is a real thing :)
Wow I expected more from you guys. Your all on the top of my youtube watch list and I didn’t find any of this funny
Claim your “i saw the draft video” right here
Uncle Roger the only one staying in character😹😹 still funny af
the CR intro tho
And here I thought these videos hit its peak, callabs are absolutely amazing 👏
OMG ITS JENNIE..WENNIE AND UNCLE ROGER 💅💅💅
Hoi mobile legends oow nice

Who the hell was playing clash of clans 😂🤣
OMG Two Set Violin is there!
I would say your channel blew up if your vids weren't best in the whole stock market :)
1:41 I was missing the intense Blindr background music that Joma uses
We must get part 3
1:38 "Now that we have smart blinds, we should invest in smart children!"
I cant stop laughing😂 😂 😂 love your vid steven he.
"EMOTIONAL DAMAGE": The best line line in humanity because it is "very effective"👌👌👌
Great as always thank you
Camera quality is good but the sound is echoing so bad
Emotional Damage <3 free for all
Was’nt the endgame the final straw there’s a break in reality!!!
W
someone: theres more heaven incoming! me: where??? someone:The F A I L U R E channel me:ok
Why is Brett looking confused?
Steven's glasses 🤣
rr34bodo
2:07 hmm who’s playing Clash Royale 🤔
Maybe the smack by famous person comes with a free a+ for us so we don’t have to worry about failing anything, I rate this product a 12 out of 10. Very amazing.
"Eric Wang"...oh my God that's brilliant
The emotiinal damage never gets old 🤣🤣🤣
it’s kinda impressive that uncle roger can keep a straight face through pretty much the entire video
I'll take all of them
Please part 3 I beg
All fantastic. And Jeannie! Just perfect.😃😃❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think we found a winning Collab.
The ‘TODAY 呢’ always gets me XD
"Smacked by famous person"
2:05 MF is on clash.
i love this its gorgeous
Uncke roger: "we get that free at home" hahahaha
Bet that nobody is surprised that your trending :)
I need Emotional damage drink now :))
I think you mean that the video is brought to us by MLA format.        Which is going to be used when writing a 10 page paper on failure.
That hoodie genuinely sounds like a real product
2:05 clash royale
Make a bit coin but bejing corn love your vids please say if you use this idea thanks
Nice:)
Selamat Hari Raya! Idk there's a part 2! This was so cool to see all my favorites asian!

I heard clash royale
pog
Yes, when chinese gaming monster decide to sponsor Chinese people, very bing qi ling

Play clash of clans not clash royale
#32 trending on gaming
Steven  He your asian meme content slaps harder than will smith
2:32 Missed the chance to say "One mooore thing."
When will Nigel finally be the one selling products too? :)
Ive been waiting for this video
He is so funny 😆
Emotional damage guy gets emotionally damaged
The recording is awful I can't even hear it
2:22 - I just found out I'm racist because I could have sworn Uncle Roger and Steven He were the same person, but apparently not because theyre sat next to each other.
Steven is so smart, he knew Asians will watch this video and he puts Mobile Legends ad.  P.S: I’m Asian and I already play Mobile Legends but Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. ML LANG MALAKAS.
I'm gonna die after this with you
I'm now waiting for the Mobile Legends : Bang Bang sponsor
The Kick gives you more blood flow to your heart, when that come out?
This judges need to keep their shoes outside!!! Why are wearing inside the room?
Asians are the best
🤣🤣
lol
starts talking about product *clash of clan music intensifies*
Bro…
smacked by famous person is very effective, I have experienced it.  physical and emotional damage very effective
There’s gotta be more like this. I just CAN. NOT. STOP. LAUGHING. They’re incredibly good!!! It’s beyond emotional damage
As a Navajo, I feel like he said Navajo white really weird hahaha
I'm loving this series~
2:05 there is the brawl stars theme song cut short there

2:10 clash Royale sound?
My face cringe so hard on the influencer hoody now my face is so inverted I warped to another dimension
I like how they can say a joke with serious face while everyone else is laughing their minds off
Awwww hell nah what is that clash Royale my guy  Brawl stars life for ever bro
"For a cheap $10,000 price, I will come to your house, and smack the sh!t out of you."  You don't need to my mom already does that
1:48 I was hoping Steven's dad would say "Why can't I have a smartson?"
Nice slap
Ha lo
This video is sponsored by mobile legends. EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!
the laugh at minute 4:36 in the video first sounds like a toy car zooming away, it's so bizarre yet so hilarious. btw my gamer sups shipment costed me. I thought I was completely a free Steven!
1:28 Rip  Died- from laughing so hard after seeing the emotional damage guy getting smacked
''Oh what about the backhand.''  -Some Asian guy
That last one could actually be a marketable product. With all the YouTube and Tiktok stars, it would be a great investment.
all the Legends in one video, pls make more collabs
"There is the backhand slap." "Yeah we get that for free at home."
this series will have more episodes than Chris Rock's Stand ups
Ooooooooooooo Ic Ic 😸😸
More, MORE!!!
2:05 the embarrassing loud clash Royale opening, and shameful clash Royale muting
Nobody: Steven: "Can I use it to beat my children?"
Shark tank is already asian though
Watched this earlier today and disrupted my family lunch by laughing so dang hard. XD
What is an influencer? I don't recall ever buying a product because of a person I don't know.
There IS an Asian Shark Tank. It's from India.
Yes. Just yes.
For a small 10k I will come to your door and snack the shit out of you😂😂😂 aww fk me that was waaaay too funny

Blindr sounds like a dating app for blind people
Infact there was a indian shark tank first time in 21
MLA is good but ML is just full of toxic Indonesians
Who opened clash royale at 2:05
My parents are very interested in the first one Edit:R.I.P me
1:28 There has never been a better image, gif, movie, or show that is better than this singular image...
*GASP* MLA, as in. . . MLA FORMAT?!?

EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!

Only thing missing is MxR plays

Husband calls in Jeenie. <Actors walk in and acts her better than herself> <Jeenie Weenie>: -10 hp of EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!  ...  Addendum: Ofc there is no 'better acting', this was a satire, people. plz grow up.
Now for part 3
If you’re gonna make another video like this you should show them 35 second rice it’s basically 1 minute rice but 25 seconds less
Why do you hear the clash Royale opening sound at 2:05
Finally!!! The sequel we all needed!
太棒了，我笑得甚至肚子也痛。坚持！加油！
"I'm a big fan" "I know"
1:28, Emotional Damage Slap!!!!! Should use that for the next Asian Difficulty video. I love how this video was so funny that they all can barely hold their laughter, meanwhile Uncle Roger was like: “Not bad, not bad.”
Omg 😂😂😂😂
Oh my GOOOOOOOOOOOOD THEIR SO MUCH ASIAN IN THIS VIDEO!!!!!!!
"...am I buying this, or that.."? Hahah you don't want that, you want this... Lol
30th on trending for gaming…Thank you YouTube

Me wondering what the hell uncle roger is doing with these nobodies….. ur better than this roger, u know uncle gordon
Ligit when he said "We have smart phones, we have smart homes, we even have smart lightbulbs.." I genuinely thought he was gonna follow it up with, "So why dont I have smart children?"
Steven:for a price of 10 dolla i will smack the CRAP out fo you *slight laughter*
"#30 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING"
I like how Steven couldn't even keep a straight face for his first joke.
Mobile legend I also play
the clash royale opens lmao
I like how it’s 31 on gaming right now
"Trends on gaming"
Was it just me or was someone playing Clash Royale at 2:05 😂
It's the colab that we never knew we needed, but can no longer live without.

A smack by Steven He and a emotional damage would get me a million subscribers
Hey I play MLA I think I kinda got like more than 10 SSR heroes PS: I don't rlly remember how many I have
Uncle roger is always simping!💀😂
"Emotional damage guy gets *smacked* " Alternate title: "Emotional Damage guy gets physically *Damaged*
Don’t we already have smart window blinds?
Before I begin my actual comment, I would like to apologize in advance for my inadequate level of English proficiency. I am not a native speaker of the world’s current lingua franca which unfortunately leads to me making numerous embarrassing mistakes being made whenever I attempt to communicate using this language. Whenever I am reminded of how I lack the ability to convey my thoughts in an eloquent manner I feel as though I have committed a cardinal sin, as though every English teacher in the world are simultaneously shaking their heads and sighing due to how utterly disappointed they are at me.  Although I know that saying sorry to those of you who are reading my comment will not change the fact that I fail miserably to write and speak perfect English, I am writing this as a way to deter a certain type of people who cannot stand poor English (Also known informally as “Grammar Nazis”) from mocking me by posting unwanted and unnecessary comments detailing my every blunder. In my humble opinion, making grammatical errors should be perfectly acceptable as native speakers should not expect non-native speakers to be able to communicate in their second or third languages eloquently. If you are able to completely understand what the other person wrote, is there really a problem with what they’ve written? No, because the entire concept of communication is the exchange of information between other intelligent beings, which means that no matter how the exchange of information is made, as long as the information is accurately shared there is not a fundamental issue with their ability to communicate. To see it in another way, remember that someone who isn’t fluent in English is fluent in another language. When you think about it this way, isn’t it impressive for someone to speak a second language in any capacity? Having empathy and respect are qualities that are sorely missing for far too many people these days, especially on the internet.  That being said, I am aware that not all netizens who correct others are doing it to ridicule and shame. There are some who do so with the intent to help others improve and grow. However, displaying the failures of other people publicly will cause the person who is criticized to feel negative emotions such as shame and sadness due to the fact that their mistake has been made obvious which severely undermines the point they were trying to make in spite of their unfamiliarity with the English language. In most circumstances people are not looking for language help when they post anything online. Most people just want to enjoy themselves and have a good time on the internet which is why I would not encourage correcting other people regardless of your intentions. If you really do want to help others with their spelling or grammar, I would highly recommend you to help via messaging privately because not only will you not embarrass anyone, you can also go more in-depth with your explanation which I’m sure the other person will greatly appreciate if they want help, but I digress. I know that I’ve written a bit of an essay, but I hope I’ve made my points clear. Anyways, here is the comment I wanted to make:  I forgor :skull:
This time is physical damage
This had me laughing! Love how they were losing it at times too! Hilarious
Aint no way he just said "When can uncle roger ride your plane"
Jeenies Husband is a far FAR braver man than I.  I salute you Sir.

Hi
When jeenie smacks Steven 😂😂
2:05 Clash Royale LOLL😂
In the beginning you could have a fake sponsor by MSG & Beijing Corn
1:46 I thought he was going to say why aren't my kids smart.
the studio light one seems useful
I feel like u could actually be on shark tank 😂
was  it me or someone was playing clash royale
2:06 there was a clash of clan / clash royal sound !_!
Joma is there with his Blinder again i am dead hahahahah
15 trillion views. Not good enough you always be a failure
# 3 has to come out and have a Chinese salesman tho. OMG that would be so funny

Very nice video
1:47 ok this is actually a good idea

It may sounds out there, but the blinds are actually not as crazy a price as you'd think
at 2:07 did nobody else heard clash royale or was it just me
Loved the first part
I want that influencer hoodie
2:06  am I hearing things or is some one playing clash royale? ????
Would've been better if the couch were serious, but eh... it's fine, I guess.
I didn know MLA and mlbb was asain
I know he always does this but i love the little "le"s just awkwardly placed around his sentences
Zamn
So, steven’s dad is now a masochist/sadist? Jesus, the lore, THE LORE. WRITE THIS DOWN!❤
Can I invest in all of them
Love seeing Joma Tech in these vids! He’s so awesome 👍
Are you sure it shouldn't be called Shark Fin Tank?

This is good Asian video, I give A for average

Lol this is funny
2:05 who the hell opened clash royale
Bro Uncle Roger was cold 💀
E
2:05 did anyone else hear the clash royale intro
Emotional Damage became Physical Damage XD
Did anyone notice the person opening clash royale 2:05
1:30 Are we not going to talk about how Steven got 15 trillion views?
They are making it a series now??
The last two channel links in the description lead to blank pages
all you're BASS are belong to us
YESS MORE UPLOADSS
@Steven He I need a coupon code for 99% off and I'll buy two! One for each of my kids, and need emotional damage as an upgrade!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want part 3!!
Because of you now i watch two set violin and uncle roger and nathan comedy.  you introduced me to them
I love how in Joma's turn someone in the background opens Clash Royale and realizes that he has it on the highest sound and instantly turn it of😂
Amazing again
Dang I didn't think we would get spoiled twice
I think these were a great idea but would have been even funnier to edit out their laughs and kept that as a blooper reel
lol you made MLA sound so interesting
When you go shopping Asian parents it was five percent off I had to buy
This ad couldn't have been more fitting, Mobile Legends is huge in Asia
tfw you received so much emotional damage, you made ur own version to compensate: https://youtu.be/iVCy68sM3Vo  Cringe alert for those that actually watch it, lol.
I think Steven Dad should be the shark
Oh I didn’t expect that nice
Blindr is actually a good idea like have a app and you can control window blinds
None of these can compare to the Infinity Bag
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏😂😂🤣
Ah yes I can finally use popol and kupa as a support in MLA and MLBB.
You should get dapz to come for one of these!!!!
Hey Steven, those sharks deserve to see the legendary slipper skills from your dad so that this culture can be followed in the whole world.    This may cause enough hype in the world that scientists announce physics as invalid so that we can walk 20 miles uphill in both ways.   Keep up with the laughs, emotional damage guy shines in his new video :)
1:24 lolllllllllll :))))
With the influencer hoodie he look like a transformer

Who was bored that they open Clash Royale at 2:05?  Lmao

*All Legends in one video** Me: *"Masterpiece"*

Imagine Suddenly Ronny Chieng joins the video
Did anyone else hear the clash royale app opening?

We need BeiGing Ging corn
No matter what, I ALWAYS laugh. Thanks for keeping for me entertained!
If TwoSet violin shows up as Tiger Mom and son in Part 3 I’m going to be so happy
I got a add about sharks wow
Your mom
This collab series is giving me life  As a fellow Asian, seeing all you creators together (especially when your videos are all so varied) means a lot to me in terms of representation in content, you're all amazing individuals and you're even more amazing all together, so thank you guys so much!!! ❤❤❤
Why do de have they shoe in house 😤I thought they were asain
2:05 Ayo Clash Royale??
The lady is the best actor ever. she is keeping her cool threw it all and going along with it
You're gonna milk Asian Shark Tank now are ya
Nice Collab
Joma has a big head everytime he tucks in
Mr beast come in slap Chris
You should've called the first product failure management tool. Because it manages yhe failure of having an acting career like steven He. His dad is really good at failure management that's why steven he has a successful youtube channel.
Lmao I'm so happy this had a part 2 😂 So well done and love these collabs.
good job love your content
That influencer product thing should be named star struck because when all those lights are on you get blinded for days and both parties are star struck. The user and the usee.
That's a whole lot of white
“You can actually close your blinds” 😂🤣👏
Joma!!!!
Very effective
petition for part 3
so where can i buy the smack?
Are we ever going to get videos at your house anymore or are you just gonna do shark tank videos forever more?
I thought the second guy would say why aren’t my kids smart
These videos sound like “patently stupid” on jackbox games
いいね、ありがとうスティーブンさん、とても面白い
2:06 boi who playing clash royale back there
2:05 was that the clash of clans sound?
Ngl, actually make a serious design for the jacket and it would sell 🤧🤷🏾‍♂️
_PHYSICAL DAMAGE_
content at its peak! (as always)
I just love how none of them can keep a straight face in certain situations. Makes the video funnier.
Goog
bro i’ve been watching since 30k it’s so cool to see you grow.  🥲
2:06 did I just hear Clash Royale opening?
*professional famous person*
Jeanie weenie is looking fire
LETS GOOOO PART 2
Did u see that? 5:28
steven dad: this failure finally getting a sponsor because of uncle roger being there
Lol love this!!!
I swear, some videos are so good i don't wanna watch them, no joke! I feel like i'm going to be brutally forced to laugh xD send help
Sir, this collab has been proven to be dangerously good, with a high dose of emotional damage, and relatability. We are asking you to put a warning at the satrt of the video saying: "WARNING: This video might make you extra happy, and might make you laugh a lot, please take caution while watching this video". Thank you for your understanding. Have a nice day.
i didn't know most of the people in the collab but i knew jeenie weenie's mother
To be honest all of us has been slapped by ours mother lol😂
Can't belive steven got sponsored by the Modern Language Association
-"Hello, I am here to give all the opportunity to invest in my corn company . . . Shanghai  Corn, and I am joined today by our mascot generally called Tso,  chicken comes out. Kernel  to kernel our our corn out performs our competition in all but failure."
2:04 clash royal sounds hehehe ha
as soon as Joma walked out I knew exactly what was going to happen
2:23
As much as I like the phrase EMOTIONAL DAMAGE, this video is doing the opposite.
RIP my brain for puking by laughing at this
I heared Clash of Clans opening Song for like 0.5seconds, love it
The girl was very interested in the idea. Kinda kinky though...
Bro I bought some of the gamersupps, they are absolutely amazing
Jeannie's gone downhill a bit. 😂😂😂
Does this mean new episodes of the other asian tv shows,
Use me as "Cringe" button.
Only 186k views in 4 hours… failure
"Can I use it to beat my children?"  I don't have kids, but I want them now just to use this line.
Uncle Roger likes it! XD
lets go smack
Steven rang these guys up being all like.. Asians, ASSEMBLE!
Was that Jeenie's actual clothes? Or did you guys have to get it custom made? 😆 🤣 😂
fuck there is a 2!???????
I want too TRY!! 👋
how many social credit do u have
Killin it as usual Steven! Hopefully theres a part 3?
Wait, You actually got Uncle Roger in a collab?  That's wonderful!
Wait but that hoodie actually seems kinda useful tho. Ima make one.
The smack I can’t💀
Oh thats where i remember the blindr 2.0 guy from
I can totally see people nowadays using something like the "influencer hoodie product" 😂
2:27 love how his speech is in line with the beat. great work y’all made my night!
Eating Beijing Corn and watching Steven He
LOL
Is this the link to the MLA format doc
Chris Rock is getting absolutely slapped in the face
emotional damage me: no  physical damage me: yes
EMOTIONAL DAMGE GUY GETS SMACKED IM DYING
the second "Emotional Damage guy" gets smacked, The like button o-o. Everyone:👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
"Can I beat my children with it" is my most ASIAN quote *EVER*
Smacked by famous person kid tested mother approved
Yessss more collab
I accidentally disliked, Worst accident of my life

ever since steven said emotional damage, life has never been the same for himm
Damn!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Oh, wait, there is more??
1:27 Man the new Smash Brothers game is going to be amazing!
This is amazing 😂
Ultra Emotional Damage is as powerful as Ultra Instinct, and Mastered Ultra Emotional Damage is as powerful as Mastered Ultra Insticnt. Steven's Father - So Goku what skills do you have? Goku - I am the strongest fighter. Steven's dad - You're not a doctor.... you're a Failure! Goku - Emotional Damage!
I have a proposition for a new member for the Asian Cinematic Universe or ACU. Mythical Bubble will be a great addition. His comedy is in my opinion very similar to yours and he is just a really enjoyable guy.  Thank you, Kid Who Scrolls
2:04 Who tf is loading up clash royal XD U can hear it in the background noise
I love that Eddy laughed & Brett didn't.  True to character!
I love it! I love it all, keep 'em coming!
4:03 Steven's face says "what the haaaaiilll?" without saying a word
How da hell you get emotionally damaged while attempting satire....damn asians are ruthless.
Where was Nathan in the beginning
Off white white got me hahahaha
For some reason I'm thinking Joji would have been great in this Skit.
Where is Nathan ☹️
Steven: can I use it to beat my children? Joma: well no...but actually yes
This vid killed me more asian= more fun
EMOTIOONNALL DAAMAGEE!
YES NEW VID
"Can I smack my children with it?" Asian parents: **invest**
STEVEN!….you keep laughing…FAILURE!!
i listen to imma A+ by black eyed peas
(when did Genie venie became so attractive. 4:30 ) this my favourite line
Failure part 2
Thats not jennie wennie thats jenny wiener
Jeenie's face after her husband calls for backup...
We need smarter humans not smarter blinds.
FUIYOUHH
Have u ever wandered why Steven's dad is always hard on Steven? Well I have, you see as said in one of his videos called "If ur suppliant was asian" He said the very famous quote: "When I was 9, I was 25, being 25 is a normal or ideal age to start a business, so in my opinion STEVEN IS A FAIIIIILIURE!!!!
Is this called Asian shark TANK
Happy asian heritage month boys
As a certified asian i can say these are good
part 2 ready lets go baby !!!!!!!!!!
*this is should be an actual show*
Bro i love the content
Anyone heard the clash royal song in the middle of the presentation
1:29 he gets that many views on that video and yet, still not at 5 million.
E
A Professional famous person. That was good.
This was just as funny! Very creative and comedic with also relevance to current events. I like how Steve Jobs came back to sell window blinds after the success of the iPhone lol.
Am I the only one who heard the clash royal intro
1:30 LOL THE VIEWS ARE HIGHER THAN PPL IN THE WORD LOLL
We have smart phones, smart watches, smart homes, but why don’t we have smart children
Omg sooo funny
Where’s Jeenie’s Shark Tank idea for ejecting bad passengers more efficiently
God that was so awesome!! 😂 One could feel just how much fun you guys must have had!
This series is amazing and I love how everyone seems to just be having a great time.
I wish this was a series!
Hilarious
woah whats that i hear at 2:05? some top tier cr gameplay?
"After smacking the daylight out of you You get increased blood flow" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think that last jacket could be useful for ppl who are doing tiktok all the time🤣
Emotional damage guy gets smacked by korean mom
No matter which is your sexuality, Joma'll hit you with a *Psychological Damage*
When you watch "if shark tank was asian 1" and see that there is a part 2: But wait there is more!
The only way this could get better is if Michel Reves was there
Missed opportunity to pitch how bindr blocks view for nosy neighbors when asked about beating your kids with the wand.
Wasn’t expecting a part 2, but it is still welcomed.
You should make an impromptu version so the wont know what are the presenting
Influencer hoodie was really good, especially when portable lights stuck to his hoodie like it's a magnet! Hands free lights are very convenient for sure! I'm a photographer.
Uncle roger with the best jokes. Prove me wrong.
Those dudes are funny, they should make a youtube channel
love your vids
I love how stevens dad went to colab not steven
These shark tank videos arent that funny. Just being honest.
LET'S GO ANOTHER COLLAB WITH THE GREAT ASIANS, KEEP THEM UP, HAIYA
Jennie Weenie looks normal
if these were real commercials then I would never skip an ad ever again
They really brought in jeenie weenie
Lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
Omfg
"I dont care if you laughed at my joke or not, I will."
More please, you all the best 😄
what arena are you in clash royale 2:05 🤔
Couldn't wait to get out of a meeting to watch this.  "Increased blood flow - 30%"  was wonderfully wicked.
He has the same iPad case as me
i waiting for uncle roger to present something
r
u
s
o
The last one was kinda genius
Here at “failure management” this level of failure is immeasurable, Thus the Beijing Corn stocks have increased with the failure level.
Please keep this series going. I know it's hard to get this many creators together, but this is one of the funniest series I've seen in a long while on YouTube.
I laughed so hard I can't breath.
Hilarious 😆😆😆
o
I really found the two parts hilarious! I hope you make a third one!
Anyone hear Clash Royale! 2:05
why is mla hurting me ive been playing since 2020 and it wont let me update it anymore all my progression… was for nothing
01:35 he actually dressed up as Steve Jobs🤣🤣🤣
I'm looking forward to the newest color coming out with Blinds 3.0.  Off-Putting White.
Jinne winne remind me of a seriotypical Korean dude.  Extra gay  (Note: please don’t kill me this is a joke please don’t send me to Jesus)
That background music was boppin lol
please sell the lingling routine 😂😂coached by none other than ..... 😛
How about a ASIAN FEUD show
Hi
the first one of these is one of me and my brothers favorites, so when i this popped up in subscriptions, my face lit up sooo fast. thanks steven if you somehow see this
2:06 clash royale?? lmao
I thought the one in the Steve Jobs outfit was NIgaHiga for a sec.
It wouldn't be shark tank it would be coyfish
drippy sunglasses
based 2
"I'm a professional famous person."🤣🤣🤣🤣  Bro got me on his first sentence.
Shushi Tank should be an ongoing show!
isn't that second guy the nft dude from asianchef?
The clash royale music 💀💀💀 2:05
Who is that at the very left? 4:38 and 5:30 .
2:05 I hear clash Royale
YES Been waiting for this
2:05 Did I hear Clash of Clans?
2:05 WHICH FAILURE OPEND CLASH ROYAL
Steven and uncle roger were killing it this entire shoot
I love how they had too much fun making this! Great video
The influencer jacket is actually a legit idea tho😂
i remember you at like 300k doing sketches i thought you got to about 1.2m but relised your almost at 5m
These products will help me a lot ngl
The influencer jacket is a great idea!
Needs less Uncle Roger. No one wants/likes him.  He is actual failure.
if this was an actual tv show it would popping off
Holy
i love how fascinated jeenie looks 😂
I would like to purchase an infinity bag, where can I get one?
The perfect asian comedy club
Yes
We need Dr Brenard (Chubbyemu) in these
if shark tank was asian (and a comedy)
I was more focused on that clash royale match
2 hours late but here nontheless
random asian comedian i found the last 3 years in 3 video.....omg its like i am dreaming!!! i love u all solo but in the group ...dayum!
Joma is not Steve Jobs, He's Joe Fired
Loved it we want more ❤
:D
Where is Nathan doan
Great video, but the 1st one was wayyy funnier.
Why is there seven (I count two set as one) but only five links on description box? Where is the sixth? Or he’s not on the platform?
We want more wee wwwaaaannnttt mmmmoooorrrrreee wwwwwwwwwwwweeeeeeeeeeeee wwwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttttttttttttttttt mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeee😑
2:06 did I hear clash royal
Man I'm surprised no one was selling One Second Rice or even Failure. I'm sure even Uncle Roger would like some One Second Rice.
I want that new Smacked-By-Famous-Person product. 😮 Increased blood flow and more energy!  And teach me the moves!
1:27 Steven's dad when he sees 99% on Steven's exam test
This was HELLA FUNNY 🤣🤣🤣🤣
where can i buy the slap service?
You and uncle roger really got your eyes on the real prize 😂
Yes please
Didn't think I'd need this, yet here I am again.
I love this it cracked me up 🤣🤣
1:29   everyone screenshot that moment, that scene is golden.
I hope there's a part 3!
Fish Tank
A
Legit "do you know influencers?" Class
*EMOTINAL DAMAGE*
Idk the influencer thing is kinda smart
I need a products face off between uncle Roger and CEO of Beijing Corn (sorry forgot his name 😰)  Let  2022 be a witness to a battle between 2 legends!
man always enjoying the content :). if u were in a movie id want to see star as"Steven's Dad"
Ok so the Influencer Hoodie is gonna be a thing in 9 months. Like just workshop that a tiny bit.
YOOO
my gawd the coincidence shark tank started comin in my rec and this guy starts making vids on it lol
I love ur videossssss!!!!!!
"Na-VAH-ho"!?
Dunking on Will Smith will never get old! This video slaps!
Hi
Idk if it's just me or Jeenie looks a bit... different. maybe i just drank too much coffee idk
when will the emotional damage drink come out @Steven He
Steven, you ever considered doing a Bread Boys collab?
Another epic post 🤣💯
Will y'all invest in my product? It's called BYC. For a monthly payment of $19.99, you'll no longer have to beat your own children, because I'll personally come to do it for you!
Last
Damn it, I just quit MLA, I can't escape
2:06 who was playing clash royale 😂😂 Love the content by the way
This video made me laugh the whole time love your videos man keep up the work!
i love how nathan doan is back with the asian gang
ayy I made it!
Just let Asians take over the Oscar's lol it would be way more entertaining
*It's good to see someone other than myself has YouTube Premium.*
The slapping could help the politicians get in line. We would have actual entertainment when we watch the news besides who died brutally in a car accident
I'd buy
Joma always bringing what he knows
Bruh shark tank is asian already bcz India is a asian country. Title should be if shark tank was chinese
3:37 I would actually invest in this product - legit seems super cool and useful
4:03 - StevenHe.exe stopped
Please keep this series going lol 😂😂😂😂😂❤️
The 4 shades of white took me out 😂
This was awesome 😂
The last one is lowkey a kinda good product tho 😭
are we goona ignore the sound at 2:05 lol
The level of failure is over 9000
I know so many Eric Wang’s too
“It also come with increased health benefit’s so after getting the absolute daylights smacked out of you get increased blood flow 30% more energy”
EW's Joma Tech hotness is VERY DISTRACTING! 🤣 ... but, where's "Snowwhite" shade?!
Just when iI needed a laugh, you came a knocking. Thank you
Love from India and  I love  your video
Waiting for this to become a real Netflix show...
these collab's will go down as one of youtube's best collab's
YO WHAT
No magical moustache this time, I see.
Steven and Uncle Roger, best Asian duo
Me no like, no discount
Does mr. Wang also make 'Peaky Blinders'? They're pretty tough from what I've heard.
this is my new comfort serie and i'm here for it.
That blindr is really not far from becoming real.
I m indian and like your chinese version of english
I was expecting Caucasian white
Bro shark tank has been launched in India
What the hell😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YOOOOOOOOOOOO HE FINALLY MADE ITTTT
Wait a second... The influencer hoodie. That's... that's by far not the stupidest idea I've ever seen. A little bit more refinement and I could actually see that appearing on Shark Tank. ...Am I missing something?
Joma's lip game was on point
2:05 "Who the hell playing Clash Royale at the back"
e
Joma looks great in the flight attendant outfit 😂
2:05 The mf that opened clash royale max volume 💀💀💀
" when can I ride your plane " 😭😭😭
Dude I'd actually buy that influencer hoodie lmao
Just in time for Asian American Heritage Day!! Great job!!
peak emotional damage👌
@StevenHe the redirects to the other channels have problems - the ones with the .... show a 404 not found
How the hell did you get the Australians over here?
The level of emotional damage in this video has me weak 🤣🤣🤣😂
The audio on this is such a failure it would win the contest.
I didn't know that Stevens father likes bitches.
2:05 somobody just started playing clash royal ... 🤣🤣
You guys are total goofs, and this was awesome 🤣
daily reminder: subscribe to twoset violin to make brett practice
I'll be honest... I really want smart blinds. this is almost too good an idea for this haha. like, they close at night and open automatically when it's time to wake up? it's brilliant!
I was not expecting a sequel, but I love it!
This video should have included jimmy o yang
4:04 steven's face is like: i don't know what the heck is happening but i love it
only 19 easy payments of 19.99 !!!
a uncle roger video, steven he video and Tanmay Bhat video within 2 hrs.... is it Christmas already!  Edit: and Ryan George.
ANOTHER BANGER COLLAB VIDEO!! everyone is so funny and fun to watch :D i was expecting for twosetviolin to also have a pitch but maybe part 3????
the only mobile legend i know is you: you're on my mobile phone and you're an ABSOLUTE LEGEND
Stop the big collabs!! There not as good as your old skits
When did jeenie weenie get so attractive. i was dead 4:34
Love the collaboration , really enjoyed the video

"when can uncle roger ride your plane. "😂😂😂
2:05 Clash Royale

2:07 clash royale music
"i will smack the sh*t  out of you" reminds me of my dad...hehe.......

Hello, everyone :) I know that this is a long shot but I actually created a game that has Asian difficulty :D It is short and free. It's just a fan-made small project. It has emotional damage, arts degree damage.... If you are interested here is a link to the Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvCFKG4vPg4&ab_channel=TarnepGames      Then if you liked the trailer you can find the link in the description of the video so you can play it yourself:) Thank you, guys :)
these collabs are too good
I wasn’t ready for Jeenie Weenie. I bout choked on my water
man ngtl i thought the old one would be better and this one would not be as good but steven you knocked it out of the park GG
"I am a professional famous person" -steven he 2022
Let’s just appreciate his amazing videos 😂😂
The collab we didn’t know we needed
Jeenie weenie looks different today
This needs to be an actual show like deadass 😭
mooooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee pls
steven, youve inspired me to make my own videos.  i hope i grow as fast as you do.  it might be hard tho :(
Your videos become less funny. Last video and this video is really boring...
Some of these cringe emotional damage are ruining the meme and causing actual emotional damage.
the clash royale noise
i prefer the video's when u did it on ur own its funnier, i hope u will bring them back soon!
i now present you, the badge for gold humor
For anyone that doesn't know. Smart window blinds are a real thing.
Woo, it's probably going to get another 1 million views, these are so funny, Keep making people laugh steven, I've have subbed even before you were a meme so I'm not here just Cuz you're a meme.
The funny thing is that we are doing a project where are teacher  is the shark and basically we’re we make a item better are we make a new item.Steven are you stalking me?
I only know 2 people in this video
*_Steven got sponsored by Mobile Legends: Adventure, even if I played MLA for a while..._*  *_When this is Steven with a marketing industry, and this is what it looks like..._*  *_TwoSet is still alive._*
You should do Asian GPS
I use too watch nathen because of ging ging then i wach Steven he
Imagine Steven coming up with Anti-Emotional damage pill 😂
Ok
The sequel that we always wanted is here
STOP USING MY COVER!
Shark Tank Asia Is Amazing 🤣🤣🤣🤣Emotional Damage
2:06 bro who playing clash 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
nice
"When did jeenie.weenie become so attractive "😂
So disappointed no product featuring revolutionary smart can technology for Beijing Corn.  How can my can know my eating schedule without downloading my side dishes for the month with regular can?
Brett and Eddy from Two Set Violin and Uncle Roger? Instant Like to the video :)
Ohhh part 2 was hilarious too.. joma was sexy af 🫣 i kinda wish twoset did a pitch too but they were probably exhausted by their trip and they had hilarious quips in the first video too so.. i still enjoyed it immensely lol
where's ging ging?
Eric Wang pitching his company to the Dragons: https://external-preview.redd.it/DKLjKTg2JFTxxAvHwNmvzmEUIeV08urdReFCo_c9J88.png?auto=webp&s=c85e0eda7269593fa8632cc82bd644a2044673d7
😂😂
最近这个2视频告诉我们一个真理，华人单独行动是一条龙，聚到一起就成了一群虫。。。
0:03 thought of the Asian president #Don't be a dick!
The fact how we get smack by famous person is the rare meme i ever seen
Wat if there was a roasting competition between Steven He and Uncle Roger, would be some real emotional damage 😂😂
“When can Uncle Roger ride your plane?” 😂😂😂😂
how many gigabytes of ram does the blinds have
And we're back again with another banger collab!!! Let's gooooooo
1:29 Recreation Of Will Smith Slap
im sorry nathan looks like the biggests npc
I'm usually having a lot of fun in these seperate channels. But these collabs are on another level! Please keep doing them, they're so hilarious xD
He never misses and I love all of your video bro
Lol love this guy he's funny
2:05 I can hear someone opening Clash Royale lmao
When did Asians start talking English for anything really dho
i absolutely died at johnny's presentation dude
2:03 Clash Royale at the back baby
But it is Asian, the format originated in Japan.
It's Twoset!!
Emotional damage guy gets smacked
I’m gonna tell my kids that this was how  Elon musk  started Tesla
I don't think Steven He is gonna like this comment but great work man. This video gives me emotiomal damage and is also the reason why I stay awake in 2am (cuz I am in China).
Is it just me or does anyone else hear the supercell intro at 2:06
5:29 that Z on his back is kinda sus, ngl
Wait are they all actually in the room? Am I really seeing that Stephen He and Two Set Violin got together
Smack the shit out of Beijing China interview
wait 2:06 was that supercell???
Mr satan REEEEE
PART 3!!!!!!!!😂😂😂
Great video as always. I lost my shit to that first part haha.
lol
I would honestly be down to get smacked by Steven, I will no longer be chronically ill if I do so.
Joma character is so funny.. Even Steven break character 😆
oh nice
Gotta love the fan in the background
Here is a video of a product I made https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
I will send you to Jesus
nice
You know what would make the first project even better Steven, if you slapped FAILURES
I just realized I laugh like Steven he and I don't like it
Yes finally another video :D
Steven He never fails to disappoint, 1 of the funniest youtubers ik, beijing corn, emotional damage, whats his next product gonna be, day light smack.
I need many more "if ______ were Asian" ! I love all of you, but mainly Steven He and Uncle Roger (who I would prefer to call daddy 😘)
im in need for the infinty bag
damn you NEED TO MAKE MORE!!!!
This is the greatest thing ever 😂 my favourite youtubers doing what they do best - being hilarious ❤
OH MY GOD ITS THE IDEAL COUSIN THE CEO OF BLINDR
He's my Cousin
"BREAKING NEWS: EMOTIONAL DAMAGE GUY GETS SLAPPED."  shortly after...  "BREAKING NEWS: "EMOTIONAL DAMAGE" GUY APPEARS ON TV FOR INTERVIEW".  the perfect way to get famous.
Where is Chubbyemu when you need him?!
Do PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
I want the influencer hoodie.
Plz do part 3
YESSS KINDA EARLY! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
It's so well put together and planned but also showcases the laughter behind the scenes 👍👍
Haiyaaa shoes in house I thought you all were supposed to be asian
Omg steven is so hilarious and relatable😂
First
i would like to buy smack slap
"Do any of you guys know influencers" While they have 49million combined followers lol.
No one: That guy in background:*starts up clash of clan super loud*
at 2:05 who the hell opened clash royale
Mobile legends adventure more like mobile legends asian
When the video is brought to us by a citation format 💀💀💀
I’m sold, how do I invest?
1:27 PHYSICAL DAMAGE
Emotional damage
One of the Blindr 2.0 colors should be "Emotional Damage" featuring of course, Steven's head to stare at you menacingly
did someone open clash royale
Seriously though, that Velcro suit is a great idea
I thought the last video was the end, but the asian-engers have assembled again
Uncle roger slapping Jamie oliveoil would definitely raise his click rate 80% lol 😂 I think it would be a great pay per view I'll only take 15% of the profits 🤣
Umm I am sorry I am buying this or that asian simping mode activated  Steven dad :huge fan btw 😂
iBlind
yes.
Man asian shark tank is bases on emotional scams
1:27 *Chris rock vs will smith flashbacks*
Hi
This is one of the most awaited collars.
This man went from a professional dad to a professional Asian to a professional famous person. #Growth
Off white white 😂
I missed the premier
It's already 1AM here and I have just woke my parents up by laughing
Nice video
Ahaha the Jeenie Weenie bit had me crying laughing😂😂😂 Another great collab with the EmOtIoNaL dAmAgE crew!!! (Also wondering if there'll perhaps be a part 3 to this, cuz Twoset yet havent had a bit yet, would def love more of these vids👀)
L
Weeeeeeeeee
you know why does it called shark tank if there are no shark and tank involved?
Uncle Roger and Gennie wenie Collab.... Indeed we would love that
My pig be too fat, so I hired the famous "smack the famous person" for $10k to make it have more energy.  He started running around the house (and away from people) for the whole day.  Next day, my pig was not moving at all. Went to vet and vet said he died bc of too many slaps .  Time to sue "smack the famous person" for $69,420,573,293.  (lol this is just a joke)
2:05 Why is there a random clash royale launch sound here hahaha
Yees
😂
3:55 Joma coming out (pun intended 😆) with that outfit got me laughing hard like wtf 😆😆 that came out of nowhere  also, the sass 😆😆
When can uncle Roger ride your plane oh God died of laughing
I wonder if Twoset will get an item to showcase.
“And I will smack the sH*t out Of yoU”  Everyone hitting on Jeenie: Steven: I’m a big fan by the way.😀. Jeenie: yeah I knOw 💅
Ah man. I can't stop laughing. Do you have any medications for stopping laughing? 'Cause, Steven He brings me an emotional damage.
"can uncle roger ride your plane ?" 💀
I would invest in the blindr, so that I can beat my children with that tech
Asians dont have Shark tank, they have Disapointment tank

I would like to hire your service to smack the f out of my neighbours. I will provide redbull , a can of Beijing corn and i will rent the incredible bulk.
I can't be this faster than becoming failure.
So funny 😂
Steven has the worst sense of humor and I love it
I enjoy getting smacked...    by my mom
0:14 “Keep Cardi B out your f*cking playlist.” “Oh come on I was going to get to Cardi A+ in a minute!” “KEEP. CARDI. B. OUT. YOUR. F*CKING. PLAYLIST!”
Where do I buy getting slapped by celebrity
the whack thing will go out of business as asian parents already have that job
I'd love to see ur films, if they don't fit ur channel I'd think it's fine! Perhaps on your second channel?
Knock knock who is there just Steven great content
The amount of times he actually Laughed is too many.
Failure masterclass
What is reveal? Failure!

Did not find this funny at all, first episode was waaaaaay better
I was here for da petmire
joma and uncle Roger interaction is the best
“Can uncle roger ride your plane” They took a nice trip to Paris after that
What NOT to invest in, part 2
that last one was clearly the best one, those investors don't know what they're missing
"After being smacked the dayights out of, you get increased blood flow, 30% energy"  Chris Rock was a healthier man because of that slap then
When you watch the live version so you can’t skip the advertisement:
that was an amazing video
Uncle Roger was being thirsty lmao xD
"It can block the sun" brought flashbacks lmao
The fact they got Joma to play Jeenie
I’m cool… like if your cool😎
🤣🤣🤣💀
is this a jacket or a Christmas jacket
Earlly
That jacket was actually mildly impressive 🤣😂🤣🤣
Can we get if MythBusters was Asian One joke could be if your son a failure

Idea: have Steven’s dad do a Q&A when you reach 5M subscribers   Question: when you recorded the original Asian difficulty episode, did you think that “EMOTIONAL DAMAGE” would be as iconic as it is now?
I’m just here to manifest many more Steven He-Nigel Ng COLLABS 🔥
This is amazing!

You should start a real company called failure management where you could sell a course how to not be a failure in YouTube. Or just sell random products, if it ever would become a stock, the prices would sky rocket immediately. Love your job man, keep on doing it 👍🏻
