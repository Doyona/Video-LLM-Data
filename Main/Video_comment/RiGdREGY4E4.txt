See she did what I did, right away she cancelled a month long trip to London for her career for him. I literally changed life choices for men I dated. I am teaching my daughters to follow their dreams, get paid to do what they love and make their dreams come true. Don’t let a relationship stand in the way of those dreams not a boyfriend/girlfriend, friendship, NOTHING!!! And NEVER DIM YOUR SHINE FOR ANYONE!!! If they tell you you’re too loud, weird, whatever; those just aren’t your people. Always be yourself and love yourself.
Thank you for being brave and following the wisdom that you felt and you knew things weren’t right and acknowledging the signs,making moves that were wise decisions
Boss lady❤
Gde je ona nestala nema je da snima
Death threats that's terrible people should be ashamed
U hid it very well I honestly thought u was just rich always am for that I'm so sorry I judged u but other than thinking u was always rich I've always loved ur videos I use to watch yalls channel often ❤❤
this is so crazy, i just randomly thought to watch your videos today not knowing it’s your daughters birthday today!🥹
Your a fighter ❤
My aunt and I saw you at the pumpkin patch today we as fan of yours wanted to take a picture with you and you were very rude and said no to us I find it very rude that you’re someone we look up to YouTubers like you not knowing how rude you guys in person
Shyla ❤ ILYSMMM Always been here for you since the beginning
Man your story is toooo relatable I really needed to hear This 🥹🥹🥹🥹😩😩
I love yhis lady ❤❤❤ Was so happy when she made that decision
dream =  child support.
Shyla is too whiny
Fr Shula keep this shit up grind hard and aye reselling is really big to so you should do it again I resell and man I tell you 6 to 7 figures easy
SMH…. It’s the how is this my story when I swore it would NOT be.. #igetit
I found out how my relationship is not going to work straight out when i found out about my pregnancy. I felt so scared, off and not calm.
🙏♾️💖
Miss your videos
girl you shoulda went to london 😭😭😭
Can’t wait for more content ❤❤❤
If Catherine had the balls she would had done the same thing but she doesn’t because she clearly is the same as that family 😂 she said it all when she defended Austin family and not being a girls girl defending Shyla Catherine knows what’s wrong and right she grown but Austin and her are pretty much peanut butter and jelly
I’m so late to this. But I was curious to happen with you guys because the stop watching the channel for a long time. I’m so happy for u
I was in the same position once and I’m glad you got out of that relationship 🤍. Manipulative narcissists like that never ever change.
I am so proud of you girl you gooo!!!
She delusional u can tell just by looking at her
Wow girl your so strong 💪 your story amazed me been through it. Love from the 808
Just watching this makes me think as a 29 year old mom of 3, ages 2, 4, and 7 anything is possible my daughter see's me in everyway possible as a great mom and they see I work 85 a week just so they can have things I never had as a kid. My 7 yr old wants to make candles and sell them just so she can help me out but we will always as WOMEN get through life no matter what. WOMEN are so much stronger than in everyway possible.... <3
Miss lady your no business woman and trust me
May the universe bless and bring peace and love to everyone
Thank you for sharing your story! Towards the end of the video when you spoke about feeling like you “failed,” I felt that. Failure leads to success. Continue to be authentic and trust God’s plan 🤍 Grow thru what you go thru!
I think you should delete your 3 videos and start over love ❤️ i’d love to watch your own content
Where r you😊
You’re so inspiring ❤️
I found your channel through another YouTuber who is talking about the ace family and how bad they're doing everything I can't remember her name. So I came over to your channel he is so horrible I am so sorry that you went through all this stuff. Been-there-done-that.
Iloveyou Shyla. Be strong God is with you🥰
Two sides to a story she not perfect
@5:42
Happy for you ❤
I am not trying to downplay this at all. You are truly amazing! But ive always wondered how that goofy ass scrawny ass dude got such a freaking beautiful and good hearted person!?
She is a monster to kids
Nightmare in prison that is a demon
Love her , what an inspiration ❤
SHYLA,I literally went thru the same thing as far as ,running from his side family infear of losing my kids.You got strong ,and you stayed classy thru out the whole ordeal,you have grown ,and I'm proud of you,and I love the presence you bring,and inspiration to other women,that are in same position you were in.Stay your strong beautiful,kind soul!!!!
she doesn't even make sense how did she grow up around abuse but not recognize it in her own life.
I used to view your channel a long ago and from Then itself I had a feeling this was somewhere down the line going to happen and for good! I am so glad that you finally got out of that mess.
Shyla it's good thing to hide your daughter's face from social media and Austin and Catherine are like exploiting their kids for views and money and very arrogant about the dangers of the Internet. You are beautiful Shyla and at least you broke up with ugly Landon because he deserve you and in the all kids deserve a loving and safe and not all parents deserves kids for exploitation hope your daughter will grateful to have a mother like you.
Jesus is King!!
Emmm SHE worked two jobs, but what HE did? He didn’t even work. She’s the best and deserve the best
I don’t know anyone stronger than you ❤
Too much drama sometimes i forget that that’s their job 🤣
ok... I love this!! this really has inspired me! you have conquered so much and have come such a long way. keep doing you hun, you're doing AMAZINGG
"Nothing I did contributed to my failure" bro what!? Lol
I love and respect you Shyla!
You look so different now. Happiness looks great on you.
Love you ❤ I respect your honesty and being so brave!
im sorry
Boooo
Clout chaser
Let her and Landon be
That’s his daughter and your daughter
No I not
It literally is after you have the kids. You don’t want your child in a relationship like that. You want them to be able to emulate you and your partner. Toxic people are everywhere. But under the same roof it’s hard not to mimic behaviors as children. You got this.
NEVERGIV3UP
You go girl!!!!
has anyone ever told u that u look like Rihanna? however, i just wanna say that im so so proud of u and im supporting u 100%. love seeing strong ass women thriving
I’m so proud of you Shyla.
💗
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The only reason I liked watching anything with shayla in it was because you are different and it made me feel better being me.
Beautiful we love you
I think she needs help I don’t by anything she’s said relationships end all the time I think she’s just as bad if not worse her behaviour needs help, I feel sorry for the child.
When she said if it wasn’t for her daughter she wouldn’t be here it felt like she could’ve meant that both ways 🥺I’m so glad Shyla is healing and growing as a mother
WE LOVE U SHYLA, WE HERE FOR U ALWAYS, & YOUTUBE IS ALWAYS HERE
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When God have you on a journey and the devil comes to steal , kill , and destroy . Stay prayed up !
Someone that is trying to move forward … isn’t really moving forward more like backwards you’re still talking about the “mcbrooms”💀 you’re the one that is making clout.
It’s so funny how she came across as a humanitarian but her today is someone dark
Omg Shyla is not fighting for the righteous, she is just getting personal for her own benefit with narratives about the family on internet. The story she is talking about did not even have her child on focus, it was focus on his son. Only if her always victimizing narcissist behavior could see that.  So let's summarize. Shyla responds to London once she learns his brother is famous and earns money with content. The gold digger agrees to start L&S where clearly her vibes were off the chart especially when his mom or other family members are concerned. She was hated for her arrogance and fakeness.  If family was toxic and Landon was abusive, why would a young educated lady decide to have a child with him, if not for money. It has always been her forcing stories and video with her child. Landon gets ill and the content income. reduces which messes her up. She has to take care of child and Landon.   If she was a nice person, she would have refrained from commenting on his illness. She understands clout the best as their channel has had the most click baits, the reason why all previous videos were taken down for people to see what bitchy personality she has. She wanted to do better than the Ace Family.  After the fall-out, she is still and has been the consistent person to use their name to get fame. She is striking the opportunity with the trend of hating a successful YT family for personal agenda. Posting videos of child with hiding her face is still having the child on internet, this is hypocrisy that she does.   If the ace family did something wrong, they aren't that powerful to escape everything! They had to leave the house or fight against lawsuit. She is just creating narrative to gain sympathy now.  The Ace Family never spoke about her in any manner whatsoever, but she is pushing boundaries. She is bitter and not healed at all. She only gets attention when she speaks about them which she does to remain relevant.
Hiding child's face = child being on internet  Showing other's kids on your stories (your niece) is invading their privacy= you hypocrite
So, umm shyla is allowed to put her daughter on YouTube but that guy Landon can’t? 🤔
Shyla.. if you can get up and start something of your own.. I know I can! I love you 💕
Team Shyla
I am so proud of you . You are a super hero to many women/girls who may be going through the same thing . You’re giving us strength and faith.  I love you so much for this . Stay strong , you’re growing each day and it’s bringing you even closer to your purpose in life 🦋🤍✨

Can someone help me out? Why doesn't Landon even have photos of Soul on his Instagram but has Elle splattered everywhere
Love this for you!! Your strength will definitely be rubbed onto another queen!! WE LOVE YOU SHYLA!!!
Shayla I’m so proud of you
I always knew Shyla was soooo different. Thank God she got out!!! So brave!! I remember when I did the same when I was 18 with a child. I too let my abuser and became a whole new person for my baby. So hats 👒 off to all the women who walks out of these type of situations bcuz most would not or get killed. Blessings to u all. ❤️
You can get thru anything, just pray and keep your faith strong. Remember that god will never give you anything you can’t handle. You are indestructible and powerful enough to overcome anything that blinds you from glory! Listen to your heart and always do it for a purpose 🙏🏻 GOD loves you 🤍
Yet it was good, until it wasn’t. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Ace who?
Authenticity always shines through people. Landon just did a better job than most hiding his shitty character..hope the best for both of u tho
I’m crying shyla 🥺🥺😭😭 your so strong bby
love you girl stay strong
You are beautiful, girl. You are smart, tough and inspiring!!
Amber Heard #2. The truth is coming for you girl!
Shyla I literally love you
Hope you are okay Shyla we miss you here
I love how she never named you know who this is HER story. No one else’s.
I think that some people are just on YouTube to hate for no other reason but to just hate
You’re my inspiration because you’re so brave to leave and put you first. So proud and keep pushing queen 👸
You need your own show
I love how you’re so open about your life..You are so strong for this..You have so many followers and supporters that love you am and proud of the mother you are..Never let anyone tell you otherwise..But you got me so into your video, when will we get to see Part 2??
She’s literally lying. She obviously is the wrong one. She only posted what looked to be of London. Y’all haven’t even see him going over the proof of her being literally abusive. She doesn’t deserve soul, she doesn’t even has what it takes to be a mother. Cancel her lying ass!
You go shyla! ❤
Ummm this reminds me of Amber Turd☠️🙄😂
Landon didn’t love you too I guess since he’s after other girls. Alll lies from you
ur not a good person.
I miss L&S
Love this for you and everything your doing !!!
I love you , I sometimes wished it was just YOUR YOUTUBE channel, me and my sister love you sm!!!
I pray you continue to heal and grow ❤️ you are such an inspiration
I’m so proud of you Shyla 🥰
I’ve always liked Shyla, even in other vlog channels, it was something about how real and raw she was
You are so strong for this
Cant believe you guys eating this up😂😂😂
What an embarrassment like you have a kid “woman up” you kid is going to see your dumb videos about her dad. We get it your bipolar and can’t handle a great guy. Move on you messed up Landon has too much proof against you
Team mcbrooms Shyla a b!tch
🙏💖🙏 amazing,god is good ,keep ur faith shyla 🙏💖🙏
look how proud i am of you ❤️😭
I had been praying for you and your little girl hoping you found happiness. Your rocking it!! So proud to see your journey. We missed you…I missed you..
U got this mama good for u ❤️
Hi Shyla, i only watched 5 min of your video ( i'm gonna see it whole of course ) but i already want just hug you & tell you that you're a wonderful humanbeeing & you can't do it right for everybody!   There always will be people that don't like you, don't agree with your opinion, but you know what? That's ok, let them talk shit or think what they want... that's their Problem when they don't like you!  & 1 more thing - you're very pretty & there are jealous people out there! Don't take the opinions of others so seriously! What your family & Friends thing about you is important but not what strangers think...
You fake
So beautiful
You should be women advocate ur story really helps a lot of people
Austin is not like landon .landon is so much agressive and abusive but austin is loveable but agressive he dosen't say anything
Ladies It will get better. Its gonna take work.  But its possible.  Dont settle for less than what u deserve just because its easier and less scary to stay then start over. Dont put up with the bulmshit
I’m so proud of you!! 💜💜 you are a strong independent women, you’ve done it before you can do this xx
You are an example to all woman!
YOU’RE A TROOPER
My first baby is a girl and her birthday is in October. My biggest fear is her seeing me at my weakest. I have a vision as well. 🙏🏼❤️
Proud of you!
I just adore Shyla so much. She is so real. So authentic. It’s honestly refreshing. Everyone is always trying to make everything look a certain way. Make everything seem “perfect”. Shyla just keeps its real. You’re going to do BIG things Shyla. Bigger than you ever dreamed. So happy for you!!! ❤️
Well I always wanted to see cooking with shyla…and I believe you I told my sister when you were doing L & S that Landon was abusive, she didn’t believe me but I can see things I wish I saw more good than bad… I’m also a libra Oct 12 we just know things  I really can’t explain it…but don’t worry girl You’re going to rise to the top…Hod bless you and sole😊
You do too much for attention
So proud of you Shyla, I see your home and it speaks for it self you can see the light, that light that brights in you too 🤍🙏🏼
I admire your strength and willpower Shyla. both you and your daughter are beautiful. Keep your head up and may GOD continue to watch over you both 🙏 ❤  I am looking forward to seeing what you have in store for us. FYI, I've unsubscribed from all the Mcbrooms channels.
Most single moms don’t have half of what she has but I’m got she got out and started over
we are here for you! sloan pointed your situation out 🤍🤍🤍
I watched 2 minutes of Landon’s “the real truth” video and I couldn’t even finish it, I’m so proud of you💗
No matter what u do in life u can’t please everyone💯
“I knew I was strong but I didn’t know my strength until I went through this” WOW
What a queen to make a video of the real raw truth! You didn’t even have to bash him because you know your worth and any person with intelligence can read between the lines! It’s clear how much you’ve glowed up past the toxic relationship. Starting from square one is the most brave thing anyone can do and you are such a great role model to young women in similar situations! Bless you and your daughter. I hope your business continues to flourish and I’m sending prayers for your family and you on your journey to healing after losing a loved one.
You should have gone to London
She did this video because she knew the mcbrooms would end her 🤣🤣🤣 can’t even deal HAHAHAHAHA
I cried watching this because it be never resonated so much with someone and the fear of having your child taken at any minute. It breaks my heart to hear this but I’m so happy your telling your story.
His loss
You rock! I’m so happy to see you hustling for you! 🥰😘😍may you be blessed with much more for you and your daughter.
🥺🥰🥰🥰
❤️❤️❤️
my grandmother was murdered when my mom was 5 by her ex boyfriend. When I was young my mom went to a psychic and she had told my mom that “history would repeat itself with one of her children in multiple ways”. I grew up with great parents. They were great to me, and for me. Just not for each other. They fought a lot, and my home life with them wasn’t always the best with the constant fighting. It has caused me a lot of issues with my mental health as an adult even more than when I was a child. Growing up, I never got to witness a “normal” relationship with any of my family. so as I chose my boyfriends I never seen any of the problems are a bad thing because I seen it all growing up and all the women stayed so in my head, that was normal in a relationship. Then, I started seeing an abusive man. More than verbal, more than mental.. but very, very, physical. I had letters written Incase something were to happen to me, with proof of the abuse throughout the relationship because I genuinely feared for my life. I was my mothers child who relived what my family had all ready gone through so many years ago with my grandmother. It was a long 8 1/2 years. I fought and fought to keep my head above the water until one day a little over a year and a half ago, I finally got out after him breaking into my home to kill me. This time since getting out, has been the hardest time of my life. I’ve had to work so hard, harder than I ever had to before to re-learn how to live a normal life on my own. I was so used to the abuse that I didn’t know how to function with out it being a part of my daily life. These types of relationships cause so many more issues than some people who have never lived or understand. You’re happy to be away, but you feel guilty. You love yourself and you’re happy you did it, but you question whether or not you still love and miss them and want to try again. Everyday is a constant battle for myself. But I do it. Because I know I have no other choice. It is possible. I am so proud of you and everyone else who has gotten out of any kind of issue like this! you are all so much stronger than you think!
Very proud of you glad to see you’re doing better ❤️ hope you and your little girl are doing great 🤍
U know what’s sad it’s sad that she thinks that her child’s father is kidnapping his own child, some woman are liars and make lies about things like that, that’s his child if he’s telling u where he is bringing ur child that u have together is not kidnapping, what u have against him shouldn’t affect his relationship with his own daughter
Felt this video on so many levels! Thank you for being so raw, authentic & vulnerable with us. You’re so strong and inspiring. Keep that beautiful soul of yours. Keep going gorgeous! ❤️
You're in a better place shyla!! Love you🧡
Y’all still supporting her ?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
U Z BEST❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You know what Shyla ? You're definitely helping me motivating me to start planning my brand that I don't even know where to start !! It feels like I am not the one struggling thank you much love 💝💝💝
this story is almost exactly like the book “it ends with us” so heart breaking.love you shyla!! ❤️
YASSS GIRL 🙌❤️🙏
I feel like a lot of ppl don’t like Austin but I really do think he’s a great father. I’m not sure how good a husband he is, but y’all can’t say he doesn’t love his kids
So inspiring!
SLOAN we LOVE HIM!!
Yes REAL stuff for once
I felt like my fail my daughters too by being with the wrong person. Never again. I wish I knew better and did better because our kids deserve the best
You go girl you got this keep your head up ❤️
Your an amazing women and you are strong.  Do you.  Miss seeing you. 🤍
The Art of Going Grey.
How did you even find him attractive his personality isn’t even pretty.
Honestly I never watched your joint channel but I am subscribing to you ♥️ you’re intelligent, well spoken, you present your story so well and I’m here for anything else you post
You are so inspiring and wow i am just crying, i got out of a relationship as well and its been hard. Its weird but i feel like everything happens for a reason. And god bless you and souline for having each other because she was definitely the motivation for you. I dont have any children but i almost did with my previous relationship and sometimes i am stuck in between whether or not it would of been better to have had children because i would have purpose or that it was best that i didn’t have any children and have no ties with my previous relationship and can learn to be stronger and mentally better myself on my own and prove that i am worthy of more.  And wow i got so emotional when you said that you dont know what abuse really is until your in it. Because i used to think the same thing, like if its not physical or not everyday then it cant be abuse. But boy ! Was i wrong!  As much as i wanted things to work because there was a lot of good i now know that there was a lot of manipulative acts, abuse, narcissistic movements behind the love, gifts, intimacy and because of the good things i had blinders to the bad. When i did give attention to the bad, i was convinced it was my fault and that i was the cause of issues at our home and the cause of his sickness or i wasn’t strong enough or i was insecure and as time went by i started to feel like i was living in someones shadow and i started to feel like i was not myself.  Since then i also have bonded much closer with my family because i didn’t notice how much i made him, his health and his family a priority in all the years of our relationship more than i made myself and my family a priority.  I still deal with depression, anxiety etc and like i cant start all over but damn @Shyla i am so proud and inspired!!! Congratulations and keep grinding!
You are speaking to me hun. Your story is soo inspiring! I’m going to take your moms words with me on my journey. “Follow your passion and it will lead you to your purpose.” Thank you sooo much for sharing you have no idea hun. Continue doing what you are doing and may God bless you abundantly! ❤️❤️❤️
Wow you inspire me and give me hope stay strong your so beautiful in every aspect and I’m so happy you got away from that toxic family the mcbrooms your so much better and deserve so much better ❤️❤️
Her story inspire mes just to do wha I love.
Yes queen! Get away from those toxic people Landon’s channel is so washed up and wack people are realizing what fake crooks that family Is and we support you
Seriously she was the same girl everyone was comparing with Catherine Now just look at her She's Doing far Better than Catherine.
You're a champion❤💫 you are amazing and blessed🌼🌼🌼
GOOD FOR YOU SHYLA 🙏🏼❤️
This is so beutyful im crying
I loved this video💕☮🙏🏼
You capn 🤣🤣🤣
He said she said
Omg I didn’t even recognize u
You’re gorgeous
Ladies !! This is why you don’t provide not a single penny to a man. This was her first mistake, having 2 jobs to pay for an apartment… like sis no. When you don’t let a man provide and protect for you or he’s not interested in doing so run ! Bc they don’t care about you.
I was abuse by my ex he took everything , now I'm healing. I'm only 23.
Proud of you chick. When there is a will there is a way, trust God timing.
You are such an inspiration Shyla
We are all with you! I know exactly how your feeling. You are a great mother!
Love you Shyla!
I like this just real and raw no fake shit
Yessss mama you can do it good job keep going 🥰
Catherine could Neva
Omg I just watched a video of You disrespecting Landons mom to the fullest whatever your beef is with him should’ve never gotten to his mom or anyone else . You need help I seen proof footage that your not right in the head . You should respect your elders and nevr call them out their name no matter WHAT. how Tf all these ppl look up to you ?? Your Nothing but a fake . Lucky they don’t have a sister that would check you and put you in your place . You disgusts me . I was even getting mad hearing you talk about someone else’s mom like that . Ugh lost soo much respect for you . And don’t worry I gladly unsubscribed just thought I let u know that all these weirdos are hyping you up for some odd reason but you ain’t shiiieeeet B !
The intro is giving me Kardashian Vibes. I love it
Females can be the most fragile ppl and can easily be manipulated
It just shows that u never now what's  going on behind door case I what of honestly never now any of that by watch us video but u go girl and get all u drama case u deserve everything that come u way I now good thing well come to u at the right time 😇❤
You are extraordinary woman Shyla. Not must women have the courage to leave such toxic and abusive relationships. You are strong and courageous and they can’t break you. God give you a big favor showing you that family true colors at a early time. ❤️🙏
People can't judge your life you lived or your life time true story unless they've walked in your shoes Shyla
The best revenge is being happy, healthy & successful after the trash takes itself out 😂
You go girl! I am proud of you. Walking away not knowing how you were going to navigate life buy not letting it stop you from doing what was best for you and baby girl! So happy for your strength you are admirable and a amazing example for girls/women who are in bad relationships. Just remember to give God credit.
As someone born into a toxic situation, it's disappointing to hear of more adults choosing to intentionally birth children into toxic situations
shyla did what catherine couldn’t.
Damn im sorry people felt that way of you. You did look sad but the rest of what people said are so easy off. People telling you how to be when they themselves don't even know who they are. Well I'm proud of your growth. Keep it going. God bless
Like I literally love you !! I’m so proud😫💕💕
So do u wanna talk about the proof that Landon has?
Omg why did you make it look like that
I love how genuine you are.
I thought she was gonna say “one thing that kept me going is…. My daughter” but she said “my brand” lol is this just a way to push your brand further cause that’s how it all sounds
For all you people on here that are mentioning Catherine, Austin, the Ace family or Landon in hateful ways is wrong. If you hate them all so much why waste time saying anything about them? Here’s what I think: 1- You love drama, you feed off it 2- Jealous that people don’t give you this much attention. If you need a friend, I can be one for you but my friends don’t hate on anyone. 3- You need to learn to love you!!!   I was subscribed to Landon & Shylas channel yet when they split up I didn’t take sides throwing one or the other under the bus. They have a little girl that doesn’t need to read the mess you are talking about, it’s Souls family your talking about. She will be hurt to read these comments later in life and probably will end up hating everyone of you that talk bad about her dad, mom or the McBrooms. Landon hasn’t ever left a bruise on Shyla, there’s no proof of that. Remember the Instagram photos that got uploaded daily or every other day. She always showed skin and never once did I see a bruise. Also during all those try ons, nothing. So stop! There’s 3 sides to every story, Shylas, Landon’s & the truth. However I believe Landon 100% all you have to do is go look at all the facts. Did they get into arguments? Absolutely but what couple doesn’t? They realized they were in a unhealthy relationship so they broke up. You’ve seen Joe in how many videos with Soul before all this happened. That little girl loves her uncle Joe, nobody can tell me any different. As for him trying to kidnap her is insane. Landon and Shyla were arguing and Joe thought that Soul shouldn’t be around that so he took her for a walk. He would never ever hurt Soul or anyone for that matter! Instead of hating on anyone how about encourage coparenting.  As for Catherine, Austin & the rest of the McBrooms just stop. You sound ridiculous when you comment something you know nothing about. Nobody can tell a family’s lifestyle or anything else through a 15-20 minute video. So just stop. For those of you who don’t think Catherine would walk in a split second if Austin ever laid a hand on her got it wrong. Catherine’s a strong ass woman, very independent. She doesn’t need a man in her life if she didn’t want one but she’s in love with Austin & he is just as in love with her. If any man ever hit Catherine she would whoop that ass and leave with the kids. So don’t insult her saying she’s weak, she’s not. She is amazing. The whole McBroom family is amazing! I want Shyla, Landon & Soul to be happy. I truly do. Soul will be happy when she can visit both sides of the family 50/50. He should see her just as much as Shyla especially being the age she is now. When she starts school it should be Shyla gets her Monday-Sunday & Landon would pick her up at a set time on Sunday and he would have her the following Monday-Sunday. Again, this is about what’s best for their daughter, not them. She’s already going to look back at the videos and wonder why her face was never on camera. In her mind she will wonder that question asking herself, was I not cute enough? Pretty enough? My cousins show their faces. She doesn’t need to get a complex over all this. I mean she can start reading these as early as 6-8 years old. If the camera doesn’t bother her then Landon should be able to show her face. The delight of her coming down a slide or her jumping up and down because she finally concurred the money bars. The look on her face at Christmas, her birthday and every other holiday. She will resent that.  Just do better people, grow up and remember not to say anything if you can’t say anything nice. FOR SOUL she deserves that much. I’m pretty sure you don’t care & you will probably end up replying hateful things to me but that’s okay. Just remember there’s only ONE JUDGE, that’s are Savior so ask yourself before you type, would God be happy with what you’re doing? He sees, he sees everything. I’ll pray for those of you who have so much hate in yourself. I’ll pray that you’ll start loving yourself more instead of putting innocent people down!  **Soul, I know that you will see a lot of ugly things people have wrote about your daddy & momma please don’t believe any of it. The people that say these things need to work on themselves, to not have so much hate in their heart. Your mom & dad both love you so very much & The McBrooms do as well along with your moms side of the family. Then you have your internet family that wants nothing but the best for you!!! Can’t wait to see what your future holds little one, I do know one thing, it’s going to be a very bright one!**
We are all so proud of you.  Keep going and moving for you and your daughter. We are here for you and keep trying, your doing great❤️
December 19-2019 my daughter was born August 19-2019
House tour!! You have a new life now, healthier, happier, go live it! ❤️
This is the type of strength I pray for nightly! As I lay beside the person who I know will end my life. Scared to stay, but double scared to leave. With no family, no money of my own & nowhere to go... I stay & pray! Thank you for sharing this. You are everything I wish I could be. If only I had half of your strength.... 🙏💙
its only up from here shyla 👏❤️
Hey! Another fellow Shyla here ☺️  you’re so strong and I’m glad you got out of that abusive situation 🤞🏽 ✨SUBSCRIBED✨ 💛
My question is when are you gonna stop using Landon as your way of talking about anything else

https://youtu.be/RB_UWHXfDgE
you’re the realest! you’re so strong! you seem like you’re at peace with everything ❤️ so happy for you
It’s so hard to believe her. She give off the poor me, look at me vibes. I came from a domestic abusive background so watching this is offensive. Also, why is okay for her to show soul but Landon can’t show her on YouTube. Funny how all of Shayla’s videos are attention seeking videos and Landon’s are actual let’s be happy videos. Wake up people, shyla is a liar
I know girls can do it without childish babydaddys if they dont feel happy anymore
My favorite unique girl!!!!!
YOU SOUND LIKE SO CALLED KHOLE KARDASHIAN AND THE MANNERISMS  ARE THE SAME .   WTF 😠😒🤔🤨🙄
😭 when you said “she’s literally all I have” my mom heart ached for you girl ! ❤️❤️ so glad you’re on the other side of this
You are the best!!!
This is Boring
Gat you girl ❣️
be strong babe you do you!!
I’m in a relationship with a narcissistic currently and EVERY SINGLE TIME I got to record his toxic  Vile actions towards me, just like a light switch, he changes up his character and plays victim and then all of a sudden I’m the crazy one. I am so happy you got out and became better and stronger and independent for yourself and your daughter. I am trying hard to gather strength and watching what you’ve gone through is helping me. I feel trapped right now
Speak your truth !!!! 🙌🏽
1000% can relate.  THIS WAS A HARD WATCH FOR ME. SO BRAVE MAMA! ❤
Shyla so damn cute ! I love how happy you are ! So proud of you🥺
i love seeing this side of shyla she’s so real.
Hit it again girl.!
You go girl please don't welcome any drama in this channel just be you no matter what❤️❤️ long way to go lots of positivity and love ❤️
I’m so proud of you
We love you Souline
she's a GODDESS
Proud of you girl
Her teeth
honestly, woman to woman, i feel like youre weak and you got this man taking control of your mental life. i will say that i never been what you been through, but let this be a lesson to grow and become bigger than what you were before when you were with him. take time off spend time with your daughter and be great for the both of yall. it makes me feel bad for you.... this is the beginning of your of your breakthrough, and i feel something good coming once you start going down the right path
I was always on Shyla’s side, I just didn’t agree with how they were putting everything on social media
Catherine ain’t scared lol she just wanna eat all that money up and attention instead of walking away a never look back
I just love u
Hey I am glad you and your daughter are well I know what you are going through I went through it it makes you stronger
your strong women.proud of u
Words hurt just as much. Damn you don’t deserve that.
Wre is your boyfriend my dear...😇😴🤔
You are amazing Shyla ❤
If you aren’t on her side simply don’t watch her just to insult her and call her a liar. We’re listening to both stories we aren’t there and we don’t feel the pain they both felt. It doesn’t take away from who they are though.
Shyla just wants to tell her story , no one has to agree nor will it matter if you do or don’t. I’ve seen the fear and cries in the heat of the moment when you believe you’re about to lose your baby and it hurt me to hear someone ( my sister ) scream that “ they’re taking my baby” I screamed at her that she needs to calm down but I also felt her pain. I’ve cried over losing a car … imagine thinking you’re about to lose your baby ??? Hope you overcome this story and move onto better things 🙌.
You are so brave! 💯💯💯Watching from 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I really feel you..I did twins alone for 10yrs and had them young and also had a csection…bless you hun xoxo
I really wish both of you would quit throwing pity parties for yourselves. You guys really have no clue how blessed you two are. I really hope and pray Shyla, that you are not one of those moms who makes the rules for daddy, and for daddy only. Don't be that mom. You both bashing each other, or whatever it is you call this shit y'all are doing on here, it's stupid, childish, and no one wants to see this shot all the time. Y'all are two grown ass people with a little one who will infact one look at the BOTH OF YOU. She will form her own opinion one day. She will also hate you two for not doing the absolute best you can to get along and be there for each other as a family. Together or not. You guys have no clue how this will effect her in the long run. I really hope you both think about that long and hard. It could be ALOT worse. That's all I'm sayin. Love you both, but y'all need to grow up😎🙏🏼🥂
Shyla motivates me so much I love her and shes strong and beautiful
“Self conscious about my every move that I tried to watch everything and tried to shrink myself to make others  feel  more comfortable and fit into a space that I know now I wasn’t really meant to fit into”. Really felt that…  Your vulnerability to express your wounds is beautiful. For that is how we connect to each others hearts through our painful episodes through life.  LOVE to you Shyla💚
Shyla seriously. Find a place with god. Stop the lies. You both had access to the bank accounts you know he wants to be a good father. He has videos of so much. I was on your side at first until he posted ALL OF THE PROOF
Landon isn't abusive in anyway so stop lying ....you the abusive one.
your so strong!
The mcbrooms are walking L’s
We are here for you shayla
Intelligent woman for sure... well done Shyla!
This girl lives to attack Landon.
so proud off you shyla.
Me and your daughter have the same birthday 🥺🥺
I rarely comment on videos but wow just wow. This is probably my favorite video from you ever!! Love the whole documentary vibes. So raw and real and you truly seem like your happy self again. Loved your vibe in the whole video. I’ve been in a toxic relationship before where he was a HUGE narcissist so I can totally relate. Sending you nothing but good vibes. May you continue to blossom and find yourself again. 💖 Welcome back Shyla! 💁🏻‍♀️
I’m 2 high for this girl but wow . This was a cinematic production .
I felt that when you said you tried so hard to runaway..but cycles will continue to repeat themselves until someone is brave and strong enough to break them..really made me tear up this video.
Your daughter and I share a birthday 19-12-1999
Im happy that shyla is doing good  but  like no disrespect but what i don’t understand is why still post the drama that happen between u and landon like i wouldve just said “the relationship didnt end well” and thats its  and just start taking about urself and ur life and also what happen to the two dogs especially pickles
Respect to Shyla.
I love, support & cherish women like u! Strong @ power women/mom!
Omg I love you 🥺♥️
Good for you Shyla. I will continue to pray for you, Keep your faith and never give up. You are destined for great things. God bless you. Hugs for baby Soul..
i used to dislike you, but knowing you slowly made me realize that you are a very sweet girl. I hope you have a wonderful life ahead.
YOU GO GIRL!!!!!!
You should always be yourself and don’t worry about what people think
Very private and doesn’t say anything ? But yet she’s made a whole video bashing her baby daddy
Love the transparency, bless your heart Shyla- it shines light years away. Great times are coming for you and your bebe 💯
I STARTED CRYING 😭😭😭 omg I felt this 100% .
We’re here for you babe don’t look back anymore learn from your mistakes and keep moving up you’ll get there! 💜
Yup!. YOU DECIDE TO BROKE THE SHAIN FOR WHAT YOU WENT THROUGH IN YOU CHILDHOOD 💯  AND I AM SO PROUD OF YOU! WOW!. NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT MOVE SO QUICK! CONGRATULATIONS IN YOUR NEW JOURNEY BBY GIRL! NEVER STOP BEING REAL!.DIOS TE BENDICE SIEMPRE
You look good with dark hair❤❤❤
❤️
This is just publicity, so we can all buy from her brand .. we feel bad for her, we buy her clothes and she becomes richer …
With all the money she has, she couldn’t up and go get a rental house or even buy a house? She had to stay with her friend? Her story is fishy. 🙄
Idk man . I don’t believe. She’s so bad and he should so much proof of how she would act . So horrible bro
SO PROUD OF YOU!! 💕💕🦋
Man I can't wait tell all these YouTube children grow up n start exposing their family on exactly how fake and toxic they really are
we got you girl🤞🏼
She looks so much better and happy. I’m glad she did what she did and she’s happy.
Thank you for sharing your story🤗
“Watching my one-year old without a nanny, cooking every single meal.. 2 doggs, gymnastiscs”.. sounds like the life of the most moms i know.. thats crazy
In any culture men always feel inferior when their women have more drive, ambition and money than them. For those men, I do wonder why they feel they can't accomplish the same, instead of taking out their insecurities on women
Oky Tnkuy
I'm not saying Shyla is lying BUT there's ALWAYS 3 sides to the story.  Shyla is telling her version(which she will talk about certain things that will benefit her), AND of course Landon is going to talk about his version (which he will share certain things that will benefit him). Overall,  there's the TRUTH version(God's truth), which we will never know. Yes, Shyla posted mini incident videos she recorded but not videos of what cause/led the incidents/arguments. At the end of the day, I'm glad both of them left a TOXIC relationship. New year, new chapter for both and I HOPE they can co-parent for the well being of Souline.
I feel her, when she said she tried to avoid men like her father, but ended up with one.  I just ended a relationship that was a total mirror or my parent's relationship, where my mother had to dumb down and 100% submit to my father, all my mother's life she had to say sorry, give in & isolated.  It's always the type of relationship where if my mother does it, shes wrong, but if my father does it, it is okay.  My ex & I was exactly that, it was heartbreaking & i question myself, how? How that the guy I was inlove with, turn up to be like my dad?  Never go be in a relationship with a man who disrespects your boundaries. And a good rule of thumb to check in whether you're not crazy about your feelings is that "would I be okay if my bestfriend was given the same treatment like that by her boyfriend?"  Yes, relationship aren't always perfect and not to always simply give up on, because true love is build not found. However, if disrespect, manipulation, emotional abuse (basically anything you don't agree & wish happened to your bestfriend's relationship) leave.  Just. Leave. Don't ignore the red flags & have moderate expectations/standards.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is your YEARRR SHYLA I LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU ❤️👸🏻
your story is so inspiring Shyla, sending much love to you and your baby girl ❤️
Shyla has gone through so much, I am so happy to see where she is today!!! She’s glowing!!!
“Before I had my daughter I started messing around with” .... I thought she was about to say the baby wasn’t his 🤣🤣🤣 why am I like this
Shyla as a businesswoman, how much would you say you need to start a new business? I am interested in making my own and I just need a push for a woman who is on a budget myself.
https://youtu.be/xQXZqLmJX8A
Shyla your amazing person being a single mom it’s hard and I know that. But your strong and never stop what you doing. You seriously gave me motivation to follow mine❤️ thank you shyla 😊❤️💋
I loved when you was all happy in the intro
I’m in a veryyy bad relationship and can relate!… I look up to you more than anything!!!!! You’re empowering and strong
You are so strong ❤️❤️
You are awesome and whoever says otherwise is just a hater I like Landon too. I like you both. And I'm bummed u broke up
She’s so open and calm and understanding and sooo sweet and everything 💕💖
WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS VIDEO!!!! I LOVE IT SHYLA! COME THROUGH #LIBRAGANG
I love this 💛
So so so proud of you watching this video Shyla, my heart hurts knowing the effect the YouTube world had on you. Don’t ever change, may the lord continue to bless you and Soul ❤️
After they split both of them shine so much  in their own way.Its sad they split up but they both needed that rather than being in toxic relationship.I am so happy for both of them and i hope they continue shining and be best parents for soul❤️.
Youre crazy
Alright i hated u when I watched l&s , u showed so fake and like not in it . But now when i am here and u sound like u , dispute the drama i can tell why u are better off alone and by urself  You were doing right thing with wrong people at wrong time  Keep growing
U know girl, when I first saw you on videos with that guy( don't wanna mention his name) I just thought you're not really a good person and just wanna live off of him just cuz his famous and so as his brother. But then your vibes on these videos shamed me due to me my perspective towards you. You're a Survivor and a warrior and a great Mom. Jesus is with you and He is for you no matter what. 🙏 you're beautiful and gorgeous and may God's abundance of Grace and blessings fill your life.
Bro didn’t you said you moved in and left this in the past when you made the last video ? Drop it 🤦🏽‍♀️
So proud of u bb❤️
I’m so proud of you Shyla you’re doing the work and you’re doing it well. Thank you for being you
shyla uses her sisters death as a way of guilt tripping people into buying her basic ass clothing brand😂 girl went from talking about her sisters last breaths to explaining her new clothing line within 5 minutes.

Truly YOU ARE AN INSPIRATION Shyla!!💕 the strength, the poise, the braveness and just the honesty is sooooo refreshing especially on YouTube!❤️👏🏼 and I’m soooo sorry you had to endure people tormenting and bullying you at your lowest point , LOVE YOU SHYLA!!💕
“the forcing me to stop helped me realize i can start from square one” girl i needed this so bad 😭 starting over can be fun and interesting! thank you for the reminder, so proud of you!
proud of u 🤍❤️🤍❤️
Love uu shylaaa❤❤❤❤
Girl l love you and your daughter from the beginning keep up the good work God is on your side..🥰😘
This is truly inspiring thank you so much for taking time to make this ❤️
I needed to hear this! I’m a mom of three boys, my oldest and middle son are on the autism spectrum.  I was in an extremely physically and emotionally abusive relationship with their father for six years. One morning, I got up, saw him (for the hundredth time) drunk again on the living room floor. I told myself this is the last time my kids and I will ever have to deal with this. I packed up, went to my parent’s apartment, and now I’m here. I’m back at work, back at school getting my bachelor’s in psych, and going to figure it out.  We’ve got this!
I work at a domestic violence shelter and I love that you’re bringing awareness to DV because it can happen to anyone! this is soooo important and so happy for you and that you’re healing! Much respects for you Shyla!
You have such a lovely, down to earth personality. So much respect for prioritizing your daughter and taking care of yourself!
This what Catherine needs to do she could be this big as well she could do so much better and probably would be as free we or someone needs to save women like her and can’t let this keep happening
No one abused you. Relationships aren't easy and you're using abuse as a cover.
girl how do we believe anything you say? have any of yous seen Landon’s video everything she says is lies !!!!???
I didn't know what was going on in your relationship with Landon until I watched your video where you told your truth. I don't know you but, I am so proud of you. God/The Universe does not give you battles you cannot handle. ❤
All this drama because a guy left you why you dated Landan  M I don't even know. He is not attractive he looks lazy look at his big tounge in his mouth you will be way better off without him. Move on don't mention his name anymore.
This is motivating. Thanks for sharing your story and being honest in your journey. 💜
You are so amazing and beautiful. You and your daughter are going to be just fine; the shitty people always get what’s coming to them.  Also: What’s the song at the beginning?
Youre the baddest! Love this for you!❤️‍🩹
This realness. And openness is what YouTube needs. Thank you so much. Keep doing what you love. Keep raising your beautiful little girl. And never give up on your dreams.
She beautiful they hating on her!!! I'm glad she doing her now 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
This is me but with 3 kids and a baby daddy who’s abusive and narcissistic and having no money no people no nothing I’m stuck and no matter what I do I can’t seem to get out
God gave his strongest soldiers the hardest battles you'll be ok
What abuse is she talking about? How was Landon abusive to her? How was he abusive to their child? I don't get it. The kidnapping is just bullshit, the video of Landon u can tell he's calm and just trying to figure out what's going on. I'm not saying she's lying or anything, I just feel like she wanted this. She wanted Landon out of the picture, she wanted to be a single mum, she wanted people to feel sorry for her.
This is so refreshing! So happy to see the real you Shyla!
Love💕♥️❤️❤️
gosh I just love her so much… literally she is a goddess, & handles things SO well. praying for you shyla.
You’re a beautiful woman and a GREAT one at that, you’re going to do amazing things Shyla, you’re inspiring so many women right now 🤍
I love how much you’re glowing & I can tell you’re genuinely happy. I can’t wait for your journey Shyla. You really inspire us women that are going through the same situation.
So Proud of you!!
So proud of you and congratulations on your new brand
I feel like you and Khloe Kardashian should be friends
I love you keep smiling put your daughter as a number one priority!!!! I love you sooo much
SHE'S BACCCKKKK YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT AND YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING ❤
This is a reminder to be kind, always because you don’t know what the other person is going through 💓
You inspire me 💖
You look so healthy I love this, keep going ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
https://youtu.be/fYdVyT2ctxU
Very beautiful to see this side of you! Keep pushing forward But this time with The Lord. Blessings!
I am so proud of the woman you are, and are becoming! So inspiring 💛💛💛
You got this girl, 👍.  Proud of those who can finally build up the courage and get out of a toxic relationship. Also pray for those who struggle to get out, all women have a lioness inside her waiting to pounce out.
Oh no my heart seeing them together and happy !!!
I love watching you succeed your a strong woman a stronger Mother your doing an amazing job, it's hard but that little girl will give you the power to do it. Your ex took everything from you but thay didn't stop you , you got back up meanwhile he is up his mother ass and running to his mommy for anything
I’m so proud of you❤️
We love youuuu
She’s mad and ready to conquer the world 🌎 ❤️ I’m with it !!! Chapter 2 🥺

I can see her aura has changed. She’s  glowing on feeling free naturally
Shyla I did the same with 3 boys and all under - year of each other - us women aren’t so different we a warriors when pushed to our limits we find more strength ! Well done hun
so proud of you !!! it takes a long time to realise what’s happened and takes a lot guts to decide that you deserve better. you are you’re own person and you can get what you want if you if believe in yourself and put yourself out there. ❤️
Babies open your eyes to the real world
I’m so happy for her and I always got bad vibes from London like I felt something was off w him
HER NOSE FLARE HAHA <3
My mom always says throw those guys away , They keep you from blooming in life. And as soon as you leave them life starts falling into place beautifuly💞 ily shyla you are a great inspiration. And for all those mean people who would compare you and attack you, KARMA.
Healing from trauma is difficult!!! I can completely relate to your experience and love seeing another woman growing and thriving🙌🏼💪🏽🙌🏼
🥺🥺🥺
Girl I wanted to support your clothing line but it’s too expensive. Especially the fact you just started a brand and the fact you came from no money… like $109 for leggings ??? sis that’s half of people’s paychecks. Should’ve put the price into consideration I literally know famous brands of famous people good quality isn’t that high
She's bipolar!!! Please get help!
love seeing you thrive and healing 💞 sending you all the love
Why keep talking about the past? Why not just talk about what ur doing now and what u have planned. There still certain things that don't add up.
You are so strong I am so proud of you! I love how u got knocked down and got right back up!!! As you should
What doesn’t kill u makes u stronger
"how did I get here when I tried to run away" this hit.
I have no idea why this came up in my feed who is this lady that has only 3 videos yet half a million subscribers and millions of views and who is Landon
I just finished reading “It Ends With Us” and her story reminds me so much of Shyla’s! So proud of you Shyla 💖
When you come from nothing u appreciate
im so proud of you!!!! keep on keeping on, love you.
You are so strong 💕
Any “man” that can do this to their baby’s mom is NOT a man. You can’t tell me otherwise. We hear you and we are here for you.
You are your daughter’s hero!!
I feel like so many of us is going threw breakups this year or realizing there worth and I’m glad women now a days women are trying to put there selves first 💜😭🙏🏼 👏🏼 same with me after a 8 year relationship and a five year old son at 22 years old it’s time to be happy and put ourselves first 😘
I'm so proud of shyla for putting her foot down with all she went through and took her baby and made a fantastic life without the mental and physical abuse! Keep on rocking girl!
So happy for you! You’re glowing & look so happy❤️
U look so much better much more healthier happier wealthy ur not alone we are all happy for you 🥲 where’s ur little dog stax

Sis you’re strong!!! Love you and your journey ♥️
Stay safe so happy you spoke out there are so many women that lie and make things up that make it so hard for a women like you that really is going threw it and then try to make you look crazy and your being so strong and that wasn’t so hard to hear and I believe you be safe!

YouTube changes people…
I’m crying so much watching this! As a mom I feel where your heart is going for her.
You are beautiful inside and out 🙏❤️ God bless you
Please please please have a will in order for her. I just lost my father and he didn’t have one and now the rest of my siblings are refusing to split his belongings. Please think and take her of her when you leave. I’m begging you all I wanted was clothing and I couldn’t even get something that little.
You are such a strong woman
love you girl!!! keep your head up
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍👏🏾✨
I'm so proud of you, from domestic violence victim to another. I commend you, I'm a single mommy too. We're all we have , these YouTube communities. Social media comment sections, for us to come together and not have to go through this alone.
You are so beautiful 😍
Wow 🥺 you’re beautiful and strong one day your daughter will see everything you did for her
Tell us the tea with the ace family sis do Austin be cheating on Catherine hehe
No offense but I knew she just wasn’t making these videos for nothing she literally just came out with a clothing brand
Don't let Anyone dull your Sparkle⭐ I saw that & absolutely love it!!
So so happy for you Shyla!  I love seeing you grow into this beautiful woman you are❤️
You are amazing stay strong⚡♥️
YES girl ♥️ proud of you and how far you’ve come 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🙌🏼
i'm so proud of you God bless you and your family ❤️❤️
I love that Shyla isn’t directly casting Landon as a bad guy (he does that on his own). Instead she’s telling the whole story, including her faults. Beautiful and strong ❤️
Seeing how easily one moment or one simple decision can change your life is scary. Shyla you may feel like why did this happen to you? but it happened and you are slowly moving on with your life. You should be proud of yourself, you are still so young and you have such a pretty baby girl and family who are there for you. Good luck <3
Hi Shyla..hope you stay strong and doin good😍 Take care..loves from SG😘
Wow crazy! The dark side of YouTube! Thanks for sharing, I hate how people can bully so bad to the point of this!!! The people bullying could never be doing what you do!
honestly we need to find a way to get the ACE family off of social media & that includes landon. they dont deserve a platform.
i dont know which one of ur story is true.🤣🤣🤣
I’ve been so pre occupied and I use to say how am I not seeing hall channel but wow now this explains it . Here for you sis💓

Shyla you will be a self made billionaire one day! Mark my words. With this level of strength and determination you will go places with your baby girl your haters could never imagine. I will continue to be your number one fan keep going and do not look back❤️
Shyla, I love you for you. Please keep being you. I love how transparent you are. We already have so much fake in this world. We need you to be true. Love you!
🙏🏽GOD BLESS YOU SHYLA🙏🏽 YOU STAY ENCOURAGED MAMA.. YOU DODGED A SERIOUS BULLET GETTING AWAY FROM HIM & THAT FAMILY!👏🏼
What a BOSS! Shyla, you are amazing. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
now landon will make a video about the “truth” smh. SO PROUD OF YOU THO SHYLA❤️❤️
Both,  you and Landon are so immature.
Shyla, a 1yr.old doesn't know anything about trauma.

He's a POS and will have that behavior with ALL the women that he's with.
Your such an inspiration to all women. You were the only reason I watched that channel and one of the first YouTube channels I ever watched. You’ll always be such an inspiration to me. You’re a great mom, sister and daughter & I’m so glad I get to experience your life from the sidelines. Even though you’ll probably never see this I had to say how I feel.

😍😍
I'm so looking forward to following your journey without that toxic Mcbroom influence. So supportive of you girly 💕
I just want to say thank you so much for this video!! Actually thank you from everyone for even posting at all. It feels so good to see a woman rebuild herself and actually thrive and get everything they deserve without the help of a man. Its so motivating and pushes me to keep on track with my own goals and dreams. So seriously THANK YOU SHYLA
Shy ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
giving me “it ends with us”
She definitely looks happier without all the bad… like she’s always been beautiful but she glowed being happy!! I love her and soul and I’m sooo proud keep living for you and her l😫😫💗
Lol Shyla here still defending her,bashing Landon and tries to sell her cloths by saying she was fake abused lol and Landon there being so respectful towards shyla in his videos so woman have some life and a heart.
Your daughter has the same birthday as meeeee 😁🙌🏼💗
Brown is your color.
Watching the full clip makes me cry 😭.and makes me still not yet to trust any man in my life .
I found this video relatable and felt these same emotions at times in my life as a Mother and Wife. You are a fighter and that is inspiring to me personally. Your a great mom. Noone is perfect so we all make mistakes its what we do after it that makes a difference.
😍😍😍🌄✨🌟💜💃
The McBroom brothers are horrible humans.
I was in a abusive relationship for 3 years. I now have a 3 year old im raising 100% alone. I've been to jail over his dad, I had my head busted 3 times. Punched in the face. Had to change how I dressed because I had to constantly hide bruises.  Glad you got out and are doing great!
NEVER TAKE COVID 19 VACCINE! I MEAN NEVER! IT IS NOT A VACCINE.......................GOD CAN HEAL YOU BY THE FINISHED WORK OF JESUS CHRIST
Glad you got out of a toxic relationship, my daughter is in a toxic relationship and it's so hard to see as her mother, but she's finally getting out after 5 years and jailtime. It breaks my heart she has two children.
You’re so smart and blessed that you realized you were in a bad situation early on in life.  Very brave of you to walk away when you saw the signs.
If you felt one month away would have killed the relationship in the beginning, red flag
I love this woman's honesty.
❤️❤️❤️
Stay strong
Shyla, oh how I missed you. I'm am so proud of you girl. I am glad that you are back. I have been with since the start of your first YouTube video. I never really liked Landon or the Ace family. I noticed before your pregnancy that you were tired, and depressed. It takes courage to do what you did and to talk about it.. Baby Soul is getting so big, Such a cutie. You are glowing and look so much happier and healthier. I'm so sorry to hear about your sister. I'm so happy that you got away from that bad situation. Look who's on headlines now...aha.. Such a great role model for ladies who don't think they are good enough to be something. I miss your cooking videos. I think you are a great cook. Hope to see one soon. You keep doing you girl! By the way you are rocking that hair!!! Looking forward to more Shyla videos.
Thank you for sharing🙏🏻
It’s always deadbeat dads
But why would you just come here and click bait us just to sell something
SHE'S MORE HAPPIER...NEVER SEEN THIS SIDE OF HER!
Sucks what womens go thru im sorry.
How can a man kidnap his own baby, regardless of what you guys had going on you really try so hard to make look like the bad guh
you’re amazingly strong and you will go so far in life. Continue to believe in yourself and follow your dreams 🥰
Wow okay…. Am I the only one who see‘s the same comments again and again. She’s buying comments? Wtf?
There's no such thing as a Superhuman, no human Icons nor Idols, that's just media speak and it's very wrong. That's an  unachievable goal. I wish you the best and success as you.
More power to you lady ❤️ you're stronger everyday and everyone out there is getting inspired by you✨🌼🌼
We love youuu ❤️

Shyla! You are helping so many moms right now. I was in your shoes with my daughters father this past year. The amount of pain and hardship we face. Having to start from scratch. It’s so scary and especially with a child. I understand how you feel. Thank you for this.

All the red flags were clear but you ignored them all. Glad you learned from what you went through.

Love u so so much . You inspire me to get out of my abusive  relationship :(
You are so strong Shyla, I'm proud of you. What a role model
When she started talking about her daughter at the end of the vid it reminded me of the quote that’s says  “raise your children like you wish you where raise not how you where raise”
I don’t know you on a personal level, but I’m so incredibly proud of you.
She already has more followers than Landon
you are an inspiration🤍 this video gave me goose bumps
👍👍👍blessings your way

Queen Shyla. So glad you got rid of that sewer RAT.
Guys stay away from this type of woman they will use everything to ruin you
Soooo nobody listened to Landon’s side ? & I only say this bc there is always two sides to every story . Y’all need to go watch his truth fr .
We’re so proud! Despite all the negative and hate, you fought back and time heals , you’re so amazing shyla may God keep protecting you and your family! You deserve everything. What a queen. 👏🏻💪🏼
I feel like she is gaining unnecessary sympathy
Love you shyla!
I wouldn’t think that you went through this 😞🥺 I’m happy you took the step ❤️
Going through the same exact thing. You give me hope and motivate me 🤍
Not you tryna be like the Kardashians 😂😂
Where’s your top from?😍
You're doing great as a Mom
she deserves nothing but happiness and success. your becoming a new stronger braver version of yourself Shyla, you've come so far and dealt with so much - you're a warrior. all the people who did you dirty will get their karma back to them. this is a new era for you girl you're coming back stronger than fcking ever you absolute badass. sending you so so so many blessings, light, love, and happiness. we got your back girl always🤞🏼❤

Soo soo proud of the women an mother you are
Wow !!! What an inspirational women. Living her life 😆 TAKE THAT LANDON ☺️
💜 💜 💜💜 💜 💜
"If it didn't happen everyday maybe it wasn't abuse"
Shyla thank you so much, we needed to hear you like this
Oh Shyla you ARE a superhuman especially to your daughter💛 we are here for you girl! So happy, proud, and excited for you and your journey. It’s true, once I become a mother I seen life in a whole different lense especially the BS us moms used to deal with while fighting PPD. You got out, and you will find yourself! Here for you and your journey! xx 💛🥂
i love her 🥺🥺🥰
Shyla you are an inspiration to so many of us women, you were brought down over and over again & you rose again. 2021 was a rough one. And I am so ready for 2022 & so ready to see you kill it this year 🤍
It angers me to hear that people came after you. I don't understand why people do that. Even if these people knew you personally, it doesn't matter. People need to keep negative words to themselves. It just shows how much these people need help. Death threats? That's disgusting.
honey, when i firstt watched the video...[acrually, it was the only video i watched, no offense], i hated that video bc it was evident, something was wromg/off, SOMETHING, was changed!! girl. rise above their dirty antics...they keep trying to bait you, putting her own you tube!! Dont let them tear you dow....we knpw the difference between you....and gutter trash!!!! KARMA knows where EVERYBODY SLEEPS!! Stay sane and dont let them yank you outta character!!!!😷
The fact that there are no single dislike makes me happy for some reason!!!!!! 🥺🥺🥺
dont know her, never seen her, dont know her brand but listening to her story makes me wanna buy something from her to show solidarity
I'm so glad your not with that loser anymore.
If it makes anything better,  hope you know I didn't judge you nor hate on you the way I seen people do it. Literally they just kept comparing you to the trash family which annoyed me like.... why do they constantly have to compare you obsessively with them
We love you! Keep your head up Shyla🥰
So proud of you shyla 😇
Shyla, I’m In An Abusive Relationship With My Husband Right Now, Too, AND We Just Had A Baby Together, Too!! 😦😦😦😦😦😭😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️💔💔💔💔💔 So, I Know - EXACTLY - What You Are Going Through, Shyla!! 😦😦😦😦😦❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏 Stay Strong, Girl!! 😦😦😦😦😦❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏✊✊✊✊✊ I’ve Got Your Back!! ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏✊✊✊✊✊ With Love, As Always!! ❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏  -  Natasha
Shyla… this was raw. This is the girl we’ve all known and love. The hardest conversations are the ones that are worth listening to. You are a beautiful soul and you’ll have a happy life. I’m so happy to hear ur side of this shitty story. You’re a Soulja girl. Keep ur baby close and find love in between. 💕 #ily
You are so inspiring for so many women. I felt such a deep connection and knew all of it was 100% genuine. Sending all the love and light in the world <3
WE FUCKING LOVE YOU!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
We love you Shyla!
Everything happens for a reason
you’re such an inspiration Shyla. I hope everything works out for you and your daughter from here on. ❤️❤️
my mom is a single mother. growing up her and my dad were always fighting. he was so emotionally abusive and lied all the time and cheated etc etc. she left after 10 years and by that time i was around 10-12 and my brother was 5-7. she raised us all on her own w some help from my grandparents and i couldnt be more proud of her. but it saddens me when she doesnt give herself enough credit. shes always saying “i wish i did it differently, i wish i chose someone different, i feel like a failure of a mom.” and when i saw the clip of you talking abt how you failed your daughter before she could even live it made me so sad that you thought so lowly of yourself. you were doing the best you could at the time and she was smiling and laughing. she will grow up and see how strong her mother is, she will see a great romodel. best of wishes to you <3
Shylaa❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️i live to be a woman like you❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shyla LoVe from Pakistan🥰🥰🥰
“Women are like Tea Bags, you don’t know how strong you are until you are put in hot water”

Shyla we love you!! You're not alone❤ i hope you ard always gonna continue and stay strong as you are rn
You are absolutely amazing and beautiful just the way you are! Just remember that you have the future that is yours!!!❤️❤️❤️
Shyla Idc what ppl say about you . You are a strong women and can get through anything now matter what happens
You can tell you’re at peace now & just genuinely happy!
And these are the same people praising you now Humans are funny
You are so strong for leaving I myself literally ran away from an abusive relationship and my only hope an what kept me strong was my son I now live a clam an happy but unfortunately live with  and PTSD and anxiety but I kno that one day I’ll overcome this because I’m free thank you 🙏🏻 for sharing ur story
I will always watch you no matter what! I grew up just like you. People love to hide behind the scenes and be fake.That’s why I keep my circle small and don’t trust anyone. My kids are my everything before anyone else fuck them. Fr
You are such a great role model! You inspire me alot. I am looking foward to this series.
Wow, makes me realize alot in my personal life… thank you for this!!😥
So proud of you shyla. You are incredibly brave. Its not easy to get out of a toxic relationship. So happy to see you thriving again.
Jesus loves you🤍
Are you mixed??
You are so strong! Your new journey will take you to amazing places. I am so excited for you Shyla! We are all here for you and you have our support! ❤
I love this so much. You’re so strong babygirl. YOU DOING YOUR THING 💗💗💗
He went on a walk with soul in her stroller.. you even made sure she had her blanket etc.  WHILE YOU GUYS WERE TALKING with your mom. Smh.. you’re such a lying hypocrite.
You and little boo boo are so bless Shayla. Keep your head held high. Remember you’re the head not the tail🙏🏾🙌🏾♥️
♥️
You came along way. So happy see you doing awesome. Wow look at you an look at them lol. Love it.
🤍🤍🤍
I wasn’t here for the old channel y’all had tbh… but I’m here for this one. I’m here for you.
Am living for this! ❤️ go shyla
I respect you you are strong and brave I wish I can be like you
❤️‍🔥
IM SO PROUD OF YOU AND WHAT YOU OVERCOME. I WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR SITUATION AND FINDING THAT STRENGTH AT THE END OF IT ALL IS WHAT MAKES IT ALL UNDERSTOOD IN THE END. GOD GIVES HIS TOUGHEST BATTLES TOO HIS STRONGEST SOLDIERS. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💙💙💙
Why every time you put YOU first, the identity of a true narc, is produced and seen? Why? what about finding yourself triggers the narc?
♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You worked two jobs and you still had to edit while he only had ONE wtf men ain’t shit
so inspirational
Thing is that the female will always bash the male like she never did anything wrong and is perfect right? And here comes society believing everything they say and blaming the male as well. We don’t know the full true story. Y’all look stupid 😂
Glad to see you back💜 your a strong woman and I’m glad your sharing your story 💕💪🏻
So happy for you. My heart is so happy seeing you happy and healing
Go you my girl
yes yes yes
This seriously gives me so much hope I’m a single mom as well and the constant struggle everyday to get up in the morning and not feel like you have done anything in your life but than realize wow you are doing it slowly but surely !!! The moment you realize it it’s the best feeling You can do anything you put your mind too and my daughter is my no 1 to me always and supporter.
The way her eyes lit up 💛
SHYLA!!!!! You are so amazing. I have an abundant amount of respect + love for you. Keep going ❤️❤️❤️ You are a huge inspiration and i’m so happy you were able to overcome the turmoils you’ve gone through.
You’re truly beautiful inside and out wow
WE ARE HERE FOR YOU BABY GIRL FUCK THE HATERS THEY HATE ON EVERYTHING COZ THERE LIFE IS MISRABLE AND BORING SORRY BUT THAT THE FACTS WE KNOW YOU WERNT BORN INTO PRIVILEGE but unfortunately there never gonna number one apologise and number two take responsibility of there actions and it’s the same people that have MENTAL HEALTH MATTERS on there bio but yet troll the fuck out of everyone and yet when people commit suicide coz of it are they held accountable no are they fuck let go of it all shyla god bless you shyla god bless you and soul xxxxxxx ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑
I rly believe Shyla. The whole mcbroom family looks evil!
ANYONE who uses the illness/death of their own sister for clickbait is a tragically, horrendous individual. It's sickening.
Wow I’m literally in tears, “How did I end up in a relationship with a man as an exact replica of my father when I tried so hard not to get here!” I felt that in my soul. I can relate 💜 Just recently divorced and this healing journey has been the toughest 2 years of my life. Thank you for using your voice. I can relate 💕
The part where she said “it was almost a exact replica of what my mother had went through”  i lost it 😭 because that’s exactly how my life feels at this moment. 😩
Your daughter and I share the same birthdate!
Love you shyla ❤❤
I’m so proud of you queen💙 you are so supported & loved
How did I miss this upload!! Been following you on Instagram and praying for you Shayla! Love you!
You’re amazing Shyla keep going girl 🤍
I cried!! Your story is exactly like mine. And I also have a daughter. Age 2.😢
Amazing video!!!!
I’ve never seen her smile this much. I’m sooo proud of her.
Sending you love and hoping for more of Gods blessings in your life! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this video and applaud shayla for telling her truth but the comments are confirming everything she’s saying. You guys are applauding her NOW while bringing Catherine down for the exact reason. People are so predictable and sad.
Absolutely love seeing you shine beautiful ❤️
im fucken proud of you !! you see the smile on your face while talking about your brand it’s everything keep going !!💓
You have a glow about you that comes from within. You look happy and you will succeed in anything that you put your heart into. Continue to shine your light and be the best that you can be and nothing will be unreachable to you.
And a man that wants to see you smile LESS is a little boy because he’s insecure.
So you smiled when you got follows with him now start posting and we are here for YOU and be your true self.  You’re so damn beautiful girl I think you know this just saying. I can’t wait til you realize you literally NEVERRRRR NEED A MAN. You WANT one!! So realize we want to watch you for YOU. The PAIN is self fuel babygirl!!!! You got this. At least you realized your worth. And it makes you realize that you don’t need to ever dim your SPARKLE. You literally have it NATURALLY!!!!
I love you
I am buying! I support you through everything! Even after the calamities you faced you didn’t falter you ate head strong and keep moving forward and I support women like you! Go shyla! I will def buy from you once it’s from sale
Damn could have at least matched your makeup to your neck
Keep going always !!! Such an inspiration to any young woman or single mom 😭💖💖💖💖💖💖💖❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Im sorry but i loved the video up until the part where you insist landon abused you.... sorry but get your bag talk about you withouth throughing him under the bus like dud you posting this and he saying you are an awsome mom like wow thats sad 🙃
I am so happy to support you Shyla and super happy to support you ♥️
The whole upcoming story was cute UNTIL he treated you the way he did 😭🤢 they always talk about you being crazy but not what triggered or provoked you. Proud of you Shayla. Keep shining You’re a warrior 🙏🏽🌟
You're so self aware and well spoken! Genuinely just such a beautiful soul! So many of your own quotes just hit hard for me. Thank you for sharing your life experience and new brand with us!   I truly believe you have so much LIGHT to offer this dark messy world. Thank you for coming back & starting your own channel 😍   Welcome back 🤟🏼 (🤟🏼=love you in sign language)  -CC
You are so inspiring! Thank you for sharing your story!
Yes girl! So good to see you happy and doing better! We are here for you!
She lost me at the “nothing I did contributed to this failure”.  You can never grow until you acknowledge your faults and take accountability for them !  She also said she didn’t know what she would do outside of YT, but in prior videos she went off saying how YT makes her the least money out of the other things she does and was going to quit after her contracted yr !
Wow!!! What a different Shyla. I am so happy you found your purpose. You’re definitely glowing. I love everything about your channel, the edits everything!!! Woman are so strong ♥️♥️
So that was Shyla’s apartment that she got working TWO jobs. She never needed anybody else to make it. Good for her
You go girl!! ❤️
I pray for your healing so you can live peacefully
Shyla......I am so proud of you, the inner strength you have is amazing!! Negative and bullying will always be there but know one thing , they have nothing better to do, nor anything positive is going on in there love. I'm so proud of you, being able to leave a narcissist cheater, getting away is the best thing you have ever done. We are here for you 100% and support you in any way we possibly can. Through the darkest moments trust and believe they're will be light, and it won't last forever, you got this mama
Ladies please do not put a man before your career, do you, if he was really for you he would understand and be there  vise versa
We love you Shyla♥️
Can somebody telk me which song is this intro one???
Love love love ❤️ my situation is similar to yours, feel like you’re stuck in a hole but its good to know im not the only one🥺 you’ve over came a situation that feels impossible🥲 thank u for inspiring me to choose me, my health & the better for my son💖
So much respect for you, I’m happy for you & baby girl.
your daughter is and will be soo proud of the women you became through these tests
You're SO inspiring! I look forward to what God is doing in your life! GO SHYLA GO and never take your foot off of their necks🙏
@shyla look your famous, your beautiful and people going to hate and judge you for anything you do,or say you have to think positively ignoring the hate just be you have fun don't let them get you. 😊☺
Her story was so Interesting until she started playing  the victim and she only put videos of Landon but not what people was saying about her like Grow up both of you fuck up big time .. Move on and continue this Amazing journey im sorry I’m just being honest .. 🥰🥰🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Turning down a big career opportunity for a man is the worst decision you could ever make. If he was the one he would encourage you to go and not only wait for you but make you feel loved and supported from afar.
her smile >>>>>>> ✨✨✨✨✨
I love youuu ❤️❤️❤️❤️
If you had home videos of you as a child, you weren’t STRUGGLING. some people struggle to eat etc.
can’t wait to see you be loud and be you in this channel 💛💛💛💛
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏
I was in an abusive relationship for 7 years we have a 3 year old daughter. I finally left when she stood up for me it was a wake up call.. watching this hits home and gives me hope as a single mother that I can do anything 🤍
I'm not working right now I just has our 3rd baby. I want to leave sooooo bad.
Omg missing them together ❤ 😢 my heart ❤when I see shyla and her ex ♥️😍but good things must come to a end ..behind the scenes really shows the life you live and choose I swear YouTube don't seem to be fun no more 😒
You are a warrior, God has a purpose for you. Never give up Shayla
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
literally love your bubbly personality. please don’t let comments get to you &’ keep smiling <3 your so gorgeous embrace it. prove these people wrong AND smile brightly in their face, laugh and have a good time doing so!
YOU ARE SO STRONG LOOK AT YOU ♥️♥️✨✨ never feel like a failure. Always pick yourself up and try again. With trying you can get somewhere
Perfectly told and so respectful
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
This is so beautiful Shyla ❤️
Queen
Shyla is more genuine than Catherine from the Ace family that’s for sure.  Shyla’s videos are better than Landon’s
Literally watching this while in the airport in tears. I’m having one of those moments, single mom of four, and struggling mentally. You aren’t alone ♥️
Yass girl speak up you so much Motivation and Inspiring woman that they can be there own boss and you can get through it the fact you work 2 jobs speaks more and what you been through show woman that it can get better much love and blessings
Hi Shyla , I was never a fan or followed  you back then but I do now 🤗  I just wanted to say GOOD FOR YOU 🙌🏼 I can’t even imagine what you’ve gone through and with a little one on your side. I love your positive outlook, you’re already on your way up ⬆️   Keeping doing YOU and stay positive… things will only keep getting better.  #GirlPower ✌🏼  Al🌺ha from Honolulu 🤙🏼
Drop the video sis!
Awe my son just turned 13 on December 19th!
I wish I had your passion, support, strength and mentality, so glad you did it ✨
I like that you move in silence 💕
Don’t say “could be” someone you are someone
You deserve everything good in life ❤️ your strong you’ve been through so much you honestly deserve every good opportunity to come to you
The fact he left you & your baby with absolutely nothing speaks volumes. I’m so deeply sorry you’ve had to go through this, he doesn’t deserve to be around your child what so ever. Karma is a bitch & it’ll bite him in the ass sooner or later.
❤
So happy to see you finding yourself. You’re an inspiration ❤️❤️❤️ Keeping fighting Shyla. I’ll be rooting for you.
You are so strong 💕
we love you shyla you inspire me !!
i’m so proud of you !!!!
The mcbroom brothers always gave me a weird narcissistic vibe smh I’m so happy for you, on to bigger and better things queen! 💗
19:19 ha!

Parents needs to stop talking bad about the other parent both ways that is never good for the kids never I hope your daughter doesn’t watch this video

Really good video
You are amazing, beautiful and a genuine person you deserve the best keep on the hustle you got this!!! Love you god bless when things get heard pray to god he will take over for you😘😘😂😍😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I thank you for opening up about ur relationship and the abuse. Coming from an abusive relationship no one quite understands what you mean when you say “I knew it was wrong but I didn’t see it as abuse” you start comparing it to other abuse cases you’ve seen and you think “well mine isn’t nearly as bad as that” and no one understands. But thank you for not making me feel alone and like I’m crazy 💛
Clearly you’re still dragging it with Landon .. leave him alone you’re being dramatic
So inspiring.
Love you !
Such a powerful and strong Woman !!
I am so proud of you Shyla, you have come a long way. I have seen everything from day 1 and the progress of you inspires so many young women. Thank you so much!
I think Shyla should taking up nursing
She looks happier and getting better🥺
STRONG FEARLESS WOMAN 👑💖 !!
You got this sis we're all behind you x
Awww i never realized me and soul share a b day
Thank you for posting ✨
Ahhh, souline is just so beautiful shyla!❤️✨
I wish she’d use her natural curly hair and show her natural nose because Shyla you’re naturally beautiful.
There is always that idea when a person grows up in an abusive relationship, it becomes all they know and unfortunately they end up in the same situation they grew up in that’s a way of comfort for them. Okay wanting to be pregnant in an abusive relationship will NOT make the relationship better.
This makes me so happy for you , Proud of you ! Keep your head up Queen ❤️
So inspiring!!💖💖💖💖
🤍🤍🤍
I couldn’t love u any more so happy for u , you always deserved better ..

Lmao. This is such BS.  Landon isn't the crazy one. Lmfao. Watch his videos too hahahahaha  There's 3 sides to every story JUST SAYING!!!  Her side, His side and THE TRUTH.
Keep up the great work and don’t base your happiness of others peoples gratification people never  see a diamond for what it’s worth before it becomes one you got this stay strong and don’t look at the comments that people post be yourself I respect you for posting this from a single mom to another your a great mom keep moving forward Gods got huge plans for you girl!!!

You are amazing so glad u are happy and u Are out of that toxic relationship leave him on his own.  There is a saying there is only one of me 😀  Good luck finding another me
Who else was sad she did not go to London.
Shy when u was with Landon I used to watch his face and his appearance look is aggressive demanding and violent and I always thought maybe I was just overthinking it because he used to look like he really loved u and won't put harm to u but I've been watching you guys years now so that's how I kind of judge a book by its cover I guess but girl keep being a great mom love you and all the best ❤
❤️
Damn how many bots are in this comment section … I loved the video tho
INSPIRATIONAL!!
💕💕💕💕💕
Shyla has always been such a strong, independent woman and that is something that no man could ever take away from her! The fact that she had a child with this person, and he's okay with the fact that he's left the mother of his child and his child without a home or money and tried to take the child away from her is beyond words. Shyla is better off without him, and the way she speaks about everything that she's achieved is an amazing feeling, it's honestly inspirational💗
Sending so much love ❤️❤️
Go Shyla!!!
Your doing so great so far you’ve changed so much I’m so proud of you. I loved you and Landon together I can’t even look at him the same it makes me so sad what he’s done to you i miss the old Shyla but I love the new shyla ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you ❤️ you have our support and love
🖤🙌
Sending lots of love and positive vibes you're way! YOU ARE A AMAZING WOMAN!
Wow!!
You’ve got this Shyla! So proud of you
Big ups to your friends that had you stay over in her sons room remember those people when you get up. Love this for you honey🤍✨
❤️❤️❤️
I’m soooo proud of you, you are such a strong women continue to stay strong. As soon as I saw the end of this click with your sister my heart dropped it took me back to when my brother got in an accident. He was driving in the highway and a piece of debris flew into his windshield and hit him in the head caused him to have immediate brain surgery it’s a long story but fast forward now two years later he is still fighting to get strong again he’s not the same but in my eyes he is better God knows why he does what he does. I don’t know what happened to your sister but stay strong during this time I feel your pain, God will pull through for you and your family. Thank you for being you and being so real I appreciate your existence🙏🏽🙌🏽
You go girl 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻♥️
You probably won’t get to see this comment but I just want to say you are such an inspiration to me & to many women out there. Also I would love to buy clothes from your business simply because the person who owns it is such an angel! God bless you & your beautiful daughter ❤️ she should be proud to have you as a mother 🙌
so happy for you Shyla!! ❤️

Awww I’m so proud of u you are so strong
Law of attraction. Marvelous mind
Imagine you left to London…
The raw version of yourself is what draws people to you. Your moms words were so wise too, “follow your passion it will lead you to your purpose.” I know all to well how you lose the best version of yourself in a relationship with an abusive narcissistic person. I’m so happy to see you this way. You are a strong and BEAUTIFUL woman, inside and out!
we love you shyla keep going beautiful 🤍💕
Very happy for you!! You’re a wonderful person and mother! 💖💖
I love you Sheila so much 😘😘😘😘💖😘
This is amazing. You are amazing. It is so very hard to talk about what we go through but doing it on the internet is so much harder. Keep grinding girl and remember anyone that has anything negative to say is only jealous.
Watching L&S and I always knew you were way too good for Landon. Just something about Landon and his family I wasn’t a fan of. Glad your thriving in your own light.
We love you Shyla♥️
We love you and support you!
You are very strong girl !👧❤️❤️❤️I learned a lot of lessons from you! Thanks 🙏 We are here for you!!❤️💪👸❤️Keep shining girl ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨ Love you Shyla !!❤️

We as single moms will do anything and everything to show our little ones we can overcome any situation! Sending nothing but love and positivity your way!!!
i felt the last part 😪 of looking over my little girl sleeping next to me and thinking  I have to do anything for this girl🥺❤️ She deserves the world . Love your film 🤍
I just…Love you Shyla! It’s amazing how I don’t know you personally but all these years of watching you, like…I just feel so proud of you! You are and always will be an incredible inspiration. I am proud of you❤️ keep being you!
She was most likely cheating & now playing victim...talking about kidnap like her daughter is some billionaires daughter that was going to be held for ransom!
I'm so proud of you, youvhave a beautiful baby girl that depends on you so much. You got this girl go make your dreams some through.
why is everyone commenting “ The smile on your face when you’re talking about your brand…. blah blah blah”???😭
Children often say to us, We are there Hero’s, when in reality, our children don’t know they are our hero’s, They saved our lives, my son has saved me and gave me a purpose. My son is my hero.
Never drop a big opportunity for a GUY you just started dating, sorry not sorry.
Ugh i love her so much.
I loveeee how u have your own brand!! That’s amazing!!
I love this!! ❤️❤️
Remember you are not a victim, you are a survivor. You and only you have gotten yourself this far, to be the best you can possibly be for your daughter. I see that for you it more to do better and be the person you are. To thrive and keep thriving. Landon is just a fool for losing you. You can and will do better in every aspect.  Never give up shyla 💜
I am so proud of you for putting a brave face on and telling your story. I hate that you’ve had to change you to try to make everyone happy.
Your such an inspiration an have an amazing soul!! Your so strong an beautiful but daaammnnnn why you leave us hanging like thhaaatttttt!!!! Hahaha you better not take 3 months to come back queen!! Love you bunches an we all on your team an are for you girl!!! Build that brand show em who is BOSS😘😇

I’m here for you. ❣️❣️💕💕
You work so hard and you are strong
If you have a business I wanna know the name of it so I can shop online
You’re literally a good mother to your daughter and I love how you want your daughter to be happy
you're truly an angel! a huge inspiration to others and myself
Love love love your strength ❤️❤️❤️ so excited for what’s to come for you and soul
I miised you Shylaaaaaaaaaaaaa
💕💞💗so proud of you.  You have come along  way.  All positive vibes
this video and the last are literally so inspiring. i went through a similar situation last year, i survived the abuse after 3 years of going through that in a 6 year relationship. my daughter and i are on our own and i know i did what was best for her and myself regardless of everything i had experienced. she’ll be 2 in June and i couldn’t be any more proud of how far we’ve come together. thank you shyla for sharing your story. you’re so brave and strong  you did what you felt was best for yourself and Soul and that’s all a mother could do.  immediately subscribed. i found this because of Fool Coverage.
You are so INSPIRING and gorgeous stay strong Shyla 🤍🤍🤍🤍
I’m sorry but how are you expressing that you want to win a humanitarian award but haven’t done anything to help humanity? Not even bringing awareness to the atrocities that are happening throughout the world. I’m sorry for what had happened to you but you influencers do not do anything to actually help society besides helping yourselves.
Sometimes we don’t even understand our strength comes from Jesus ❤️
Wow you are AMAZING!!!!!! And so strong when you felt the weakest. God bless you beautiful 🤍
That guy shows off all that shit but such a COWARD not letting her keep the car. Loser. So glad you woke up & got the fuck outta there.
I love this video of you Shyla. Im Going to be honest I’ve been watching you all for a long time…. And this is the most beautiful and raw I’ve ever seen you. Inspiring. Keep going💞
So inspiring
Shayla you look amazing your glow about you is back. So happy to see you again.  I really hope life is getting better for you, I couldn’t imagine the things you had to go through to just get where you are today. You are so strong and it shows. Can’t wait for the next part. ✌🏼🤍
lmao
I went through similarities that lasted more than decades and let me tell you it wasn’t deserved on my end but SHIT happens 🤷🏻‍♀️🙅🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️. I’m so grateful to GOD the ALMIGHTY LORD 🙌🏼🙏🏻💯❤️😇😍☝🏻👏🏼 who’s NEVER EVER ABANDONED US. I pray for EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD that things WILL BE BETTER Amen 🙏🏻.
We love you Shyla💕👑
I’m so happy😄 @Shyla that you are doing MUCH better than when you were with Loser Brandon 🤣🤣💯👏🏼👍🏼
Purrrrr always was team #shyla Bc of how much of a BOSS BABE she is

Absolute respect for this beautiful lady 💯 you rise Queen 👑 claim back your throne
1 Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. 2 I will say of the Lord, “He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.”  3 Surely he will save you from the fowler’s snare and from the deadly pestilence. 4 He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. 5 You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, 6 nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday. 7 A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you. 8 You will only observe with your eyes and see the punishment of the wicked. 9 If you say, “The Lord is my refuge,” and you make the Most High your dwelling, 10 no harm will overtake you, no disaster will come near your tent. 11 For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone. 13 You will tread on the lion and the cobra; you will trample the great lion and the serpent.  14 “Because he loves me,” says the Lord, “I will rescue him; I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name. 15 He will call on me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble, I will deliver him and honor him. 16 With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.” amen
More thank happy for you 😩💖💖

He took you out so you'd know truth an now you know an now your free do your thang an be the super human you want to be. God saved you from selling your soul. He saved you girl by opening your eyes. God blessed you with your baby to set you an your daughter free.
I like your style of dressing I would totally buy your clothing line ! I hope you seek the help you need to heal from childhood trauma and trauma from choosing the wrong partner . I feel sorry to hear your story and may I also add in sorry for your lost with your big sis . I lost my big sis in march 2019.
this literally gave me chills, I love you sm shyla💗
I’m with you Shyla❤️ god bless you
so so proud of you!!!🥲
We have a lot in common. I too left an abusive relationship after my daughter was born. I have three and my oldest was kidnapped when he was two and my daughter was 6mo. I started my own YouTube channel recently and have been feeling like I also need to tell my story. Thanks for your transparency… maybe I will one day.
People will never be satisfied, be you.
All the love and support
You are such a strong woman, and beautiful an amazing mom to your daughter .💝 we are here for you!
if you knew for four years.. why would you have a child with the person..? some things in here doesn’t make complete sense in my opinion. but i’m not going to bash shyla or landon.. we all don’t know EXACTLY what happen,, we are only hearing it for the outside.  makes me feel good shyla and landon look way happier where they are rn tho!
Shayla you need to come back to YouTube again! You story is amazing! Keep doing you
You were abusive and violent as well with your ex. You should admit that instead of acting like the victim. Both of you were wrong and you should admit it
I hope Landon shares his side where his life gets ruined also. I’d love to hear his story.
You skipped the part also about your partner going through cancer which is serious life or death issue.. really hope you don’t blame your ex on everything. Because part of healing is also knowing you were wrong too.
Heal
You are so awesome.. you know you are healing when you can start talking about what you went through
The Intro is liiiiiit
We are here for you! ❤️
I love how you’re not just disappearing and you’re standing strong. Best revenge against a narcissist that wants to control you. You are a smart woman Shyla, happy for you 💜
Welcome back 💕
I love to see n hear that you are doing much better
You are all heart, all love. Congrats for owning your story & sharing it. 🤍
I support you! ❤️
❤️
Shyla❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ You’re a star babyyyyyy✨✨✨✨✨ So happy uve rid yourself of this bloke ass💯
I used to watch your couples channel but I stopped because of what you did to him after he pranked you. It was clear yall wasn't gonna work. Get rid of the victim mentality and take a hard look in the mirror.
I‘m so proud of you, you‘re incredible. We‘re here for you❤️
We are routing for you and your baby girl  Much love and support 💕
QUEEN SHYLA, YOU MY DEAR ARE A SUPERWOMAN💞👑✨ BLESSINGS UPON BLESSINGS.
The fact that she needs to film this kind of videos says a lot. Cuál es la necesidad dios mío
😩 soooo happy for you you look so happy and peaceful
I luved this so so much! Its crazy how men think they have control over women and i am just so happy to see that she is doing her own thing and is being a free girl! luv you! you go gurl! <3
But don’t forget to add the parts you did as-well make his life a nightmare y’all both fake and shouldn’t even have that little girl immature parents she honestly better off with her dad and his family then with her
This is such a beautiful, engaging, and vibrant storytelling video. I support her especially as a domestic violence survivor myself.
You are so strong and so beautiful! Don’t stop chasing your dreams!
U fucking rock!!!
I feel so bad for you :(
I never watched your Chanel because I hated him. I’m so happy you have your own and got to hear your story. Here to support you now 😊!!!❤️❤️
You are real, strong and a powerful women Shyla. The way you have handled yourself since the beginning of the L&S mess is commendable. People should really look up to you. Keep pushing. We are all excited about your brand launch when it will be announced. :)
You are pure light baby!!!!!
Extremely happy for you Shyla! Sending all the love and positive vibes your way :)
❤
let me guess, single mom?
OMG.  I just don't know what to say, but there are two sides to a story and I think you just present yourself this way and leave a lot of things out.   Have you mentioned hitting Landon....NOO you have not.  Look up Narcissism, acting like a victim.  I saw that video of you being abusive and accusing others who have helped you raise your child.  You turned away from everyone who had assisted you and victimized yourself.   You are the one out of control and need help.  I will not watch any of your videos because I just don't believe you.
❤️
Your beautiful and a good person
My heart is feeling your words so much, and I admire how strong you are. I can't wait to see what is more to come from an amazing woman and mom🙏🏽❤  I feel so inspired by your words already💕
❤️❤️❤️
You are so brave to share your story, we have to figure out how to get through it somehow and your way of pushing forward is inspiring.
I think the experience you had with your parents and dad really reflected on your relationship with Landon. You projected your insecurities and fears onto that relationship. It’s sad. You clearly have a lot of trauma and PTSD from your childhood.
Just subscribed. I was in an abusive relationship for 3 years. Had to get a restraining order and actually ended up pregnant (forced, as well) ended up with a miscarriage. I had to get a restraining order. To this day, im still in treatment for it. I admire you 🥰
The smile on your face when you're talking about your brand and how you're proud of yourself is everything :)
We are here for you Shyla!
So proud of you girl ♥️
Oh Shyla, your story is very similar to mine, I really NEEDED to see this video today. From my dad being absent in my life,  to finding a narcissist, who I married and now my divorce can't get here soon enough. It's hard when the whole world sees  him as the nice one, out going one, and me the bitch, the bitter one, no one knew what was going on behind closed doors, I truly hope to shine once I'm away from him for good! And maybe it's him not me, like he made me believe all these years, I applaud you for leaving now, and not waiting years like I did! I can't wait to see your brand and I support you all the way❤👏🏻💪🏻
I love this video so muchhhh!
The smile on your face when you're talking about your brand and how you're proud of yourself is everything :)
Everyone should understand the arc of an abusive relationship.  Idealize, devalue and discard.  Most of these relationships are psychologically abusive but can be physically, verbally, sexually, and financially as well.   The abusers are usually narcissists or sociopaths and this can happen to men and women in what ever kind of sexual identification their is.  They always start out as prince or princess charming during the idealization phase and it goes downhill from their as they start their abusive behavior little by little.  Narcissists and sociopaths are 10-15% of the population and they usually target people with low self esteem and who lack boundaries but not always.  It could happen to anybody.  Trust me.
So proud of u 🤍
We are so proud of you Shyla <3 your true supporters will always be on your side.
You are a strong mother Shyla!!! I love you and baby girl ❤️
Dear Ms. Shyla Walker we are waiting for the part 2. ❤️
I am truly proud and excited for you! I cannot wait to see where this journey takes you and baby girl Soul. Your growth is inspiring! This self-love journey is going to be everything you've imagined 🙌🏼. Can't wait to join along ❤
Hope you do what’s best baby Soul. Im not familiar with you or Landon’s channel. Became a new subscriber after watching your first video on here 😞. Just watched Landon’s truth video. Wishing you guys both the best but after watching his side I rather unsubscribe.
Not him with barely 80k views nd shyla with millions LMFAO 🤣  embarrassing
Shyla is such an intelligent young lady. She speaks so well. Unlike her ex sis in law she can’t even make senses. But Shyla I’m proud to see her living her life
always believe the victims! ❤️
Life is only about eating shitting shower and sleeping. Thats what life boils down too.
You can’t empress everyone shayla Hope you good many blessings your way continue to be strong women that you are 💙🙏🏽
Blessings to you and Souline! Love this space you’re in. Stay in it, Karma will do the rest! 💜💜💜
Wow inspirational woman. Hearing her story and who she is BEING in the world really makes me want to support her brand because now we understand what she's had to go through to get to where she is today.
Shyla I've been here since the beginning and I'm so sorry you went threw this and I'm so happy you have been finding your way you deserve it and inspire others so keep doing what you have to do for that little girl of yours and you will for sure shine over all ! God bless girl 🙏❤️
Ily❤️
We’re so proud of you Shyla. Hope you only  get success in your life ahead and no more trauma and failures ❤️🧿
So proud of you Shyla ❤️‍🩹

Stay strong shyla...we are with you
i love this so much! my daughter is 3 months now and everyday i feel like i keep failing her bc of my situation but listening to your story gives me so much hope and motivation and i just wanna thank you for that ❤️
I’m so happy to see you back on yt 😊 I’ve been in similar situations in the past & I really admire your ability to pick yourself back up so quickly. It’s also been really healing to see the wider community support you bc I didn’t have that when I first came out with my experiences & I’m glad the world is becoming a more compassionate place. Hope you & your daughter are doing well 💖💕
Whats her brand
Go girl you can do it 🥰
I feel like Shyla was made out to be someone so different to who she is! Her whole vibe is so different… I’m here for it!
We love you always
I see your pain, trauma and damage! How dare he make out he’s the victim if he was really the victim he wouldn’t be such a loud cocky aragant twat he wouldn’t know pain or trauma if it smashed him in the face you can tell he’s manipulating and finds it one big joke because he narcissistic
The way u re telling the story is so nice. We are also proud of u!
Glad to see u! This project is amazing. So proud of u.
We love you shyla 💓💓🇰🇪
What’s your brand ???? I want to support
❤❤
I support you girl! Move on you can do so much better! File police reports and remove yourself from bad people!
Thank you so much for opening up..♡ coming out of a toxic relationship as well and feeling so sad and used and all the things.. but your videos helped me a lot
She's like Rhianna and Rita Ora put together
I love you Shyla keep your pretty head held high!! I lost my sister when I was 7 years old its hard to handle but you got this girl you've accomplished alot!❤️
Lets be honest you were always too good for him he was always punching,  and his mother is a sociopath,  you just do you move on, protect yr daughter at all costs.
Rooting for you❤️❤️❤️
I am so freaking proud of you shyla!!! You are such a light to this world and this industry!!! Keep shining girly!!! I’m always here for you ❤️💞
I feel like when she says “abuse “ like if it was only him Yk. But it was her too like as if landon didn’t share videos that made me look at her different. I’m not saying it was all her but she def was doing it back
The problem is you. Not the man you are dating.
I'm so sorry about the passing of your sister. 😪 May her soul rest in peace in Jesus's  Name. Amen. 🙏 I didn't know you were going through grief along with everything else we know was happening. Stay strong. Jesus loves you and you have many people who do as well. ❤
I love you Shyla I’ve been one of ur biggest supporters since day 1, you’re so pure. And give me inspiration, you’ve come so far and ur such a strong women, if you’re reading this girl just know you changed my perspective on a lot of things. 🙏🏽🥰
I saw from the start you were not in the healthiest relationship 😢 But I’m so glad you are here now! You inspire many!🤍
Shyla i loveee you ❤️
I feel you mommy, thank god you got out in that relationship🙏💕
My passion changes like the seasons. I just know I have a story I want to tell!  Happpy for you shyla
You’re so strong Shayla! 💕
Shyla….is very borderline lol
You are so graceful! I hope you continue to heal..
Shyla You were so much prettier and naturally good looking with your sexy libra nose. You had that sexy libra face too that I love on libra women. You killed it with the chop to the sides of your nose. It looks like common hard stiff fake nose too. Dk why anybody would want that boring pencil straight hard looking fake nose that they all look like. Its not natural or cute ever
From one mother to another, your an inspiration to women!  Is moms will do anything to keep our children safe.   I also know my son gave me real purpose in life.  May God bless you and your family always, girl!   I’m so proud of you and will continue to support you through your platforms.  💕💯
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH ❤️😭 I love your vulnerability because SO SO MANY people can relate to your situation. So many people feel still stuck and videos like this gives them such motivation and hope. “FOLLOW YOUR PASSION AND IT WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE..” ❤️
Ahhhhh loooooove this for you beautiful!
You have a whole community on your side beautiful
Girll life would’ve been soo different if you would’ve gone to London
Love you always boss lady ❤️
Not a clue who this is or what the video is about. Nothing like anything else on my recommended has ever been. What the fuck
You go shayla! 💝💝 So happy for you and only wishing the best for you! You are a survivor and you are strong and brave!!!!💝💪🏻
People just suck. They are ridiculously unhappy so they want to make really sure everyone around them is as unhappy as they are as well so they sit alone in their pitiful homes with their pitiful lonely lives & say stuff they are way too weak & pathetic to say irl. It's deplorable & cowardly & it says WAY more about them than it ever does about you.  This is the first video of yours I've ever seen but the explanation above is internet 101. Be as abusive as you can be while usually having some anti-bullying stuff on their own profiles. Fudging hypocritical tools.
Yesssss Shyla believe in yourself you are so worthy 💓 we love you !!!
Shyla, you’re a inspiration & real. I loved watching this video & feel like we are so much alike in so many ways, keep being your beautiful self! You’re already superhuman!

♥️Love you girl your a boss proud of you mama keep being strong and smart 🙏
literally didn’t even know you made a separate channel until your video popped up on the trending page. you are so strong. we’re here for you 🤍
Only up from here💙 2022 IS YOUR YEAR 🥂
I'm so happy for you! The fact that you went through something so traumatizing and came back up is inspiring. I'm glad you're doing the absolute best for yourself and your daughter. You're definitely glowing and I see how happy you are now. Sending you so much love <3
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ! Genuinely pray for nothing but the world for you. You are here literally talking about what inspired you to pursue one of your dreams and how strong it made you. This is real. May god bless you in this new journey of yours. May god bless everyone around you who have helped you along the way. May god bless your little one. Wish you nothing but the best and continue doing you. When you focus on just yourself this is what the outcome is. I love this for you 💗
I love this 🙏🏽
i love this, can’t wait to see more of you Shyla, glad to have you back❤️
I love it ♥️🥺 such an inspiration, I’m proud I’m proud.
I remember getting in a horrible fight with my bd and that night when I got home him & my daughter were no where to be found it was truly the WORST feeling I have ever felt to this day I begged I cried I called 100x and he would answer every now and then saying “you’ll never see her again I’m taking custody” any person who does this to their SO male or female is heartless! I remember when you guys first broke up everyone was on his side taking all these false stories when they had no idea what you personally went through!
Am I the only one wondering what’s on her chest? Looks like she got scratched
Your so inspirational!!! Especially for women going threw the same thing.
Shayla is so pretty.
I've never felt so connected to any YouTuber before. But you. I feel so much connection. Be strong 🙏🏻 All is well
...Who is this random chick and why is she trending?
i dont usually comment on videos but i see so many similarities between us. this is my first time seeing this channel but already youre so much of an inspiration to me. I'm currently 7 months pregnant realizing the same things you realized as well, wanting the best for myself and my daughter. KNOWING that we deserve better than what we are receiving from her father, knowing i dont want her around the constant fighting and knowing i need to get away from this relationship so that i can be the best mom possible for her and to start following my dreams so that i can be a true role model for her. instantly subscribed and liked- cant wait to see how your story continues and what lessons i can learn from it! keep it up you're a great mom :) any advice on keeping the boundaries between you and the father while not taking away from your child and not running back to him even though the love is still there? i dont want to push him away from being an active parent in her life but i also dont want to settle for less than what i deserve because i want us to be a family
She’s back and she’s better !!
Good for you girl so inspirational! I’m glad you are okay and happier! ☺️💙
You go girl ✨!
shes just milking this literally shyla grow a pair
takes a strong person to leave. very happy for you and your baby
I wanna know her brand
❤️❤️❤️❤️🧿🧿🧿
You looks amazing! First of all! You just sound like your in a better place and I’m glad your feeling yourself again shyla but better ❤️ Can’t wait to see what your brand is all about and can’t wait for part 2❤️
The smile on your face when you're talking about your brand and how you're proud of yourself is everything :)
You’re such a strong woman 🥺🙏 I pray for your success ❤️
What the F is this BS?
Such an amazing woman & mother ❣️
Ohhhh shyla be strong girl! I love u
I hope that you continue to post on you tube. I am glad that you are doing much better for you and  Soul. She will definitely grow up and be able to talk about what a strong and empowering you are. God bless.
She is so beautiful a family person she seems to have a kind soul. It's an honor to be part of her fan base
The smile on your face when you're talking about your brand and how you're proud of yourself is everything :)
Shyla girl You are so strong! Parts of this video gave me chills! I’ve literally been there telling my bd “I can’t trust you with our son, I’m terrified you’ll take him and I’ll never see him again” I cried hearing you say that I’m such fear because I related so much! Keep going girl You are amazing ❤️
I am so glad to see how far you’ve became from your traumatic past. Just remember we are all human, we all make mistakes big or little, we fall, we give up etc but it only makes us stronger. I pray for a healing journey for you Shyla 💫
Hopefully you’ll be able to get Thru this
Get a fucking job.
Sending you so much love Shyla, you are so strong and I’m so sorry for the things you’ve gone through and continue to go through. Continue to stay strong 💜💜💜💜
You’re absolutely amazing !
Yes shyla♥️♥️♥️♥️
Damn bro. I’m so emotional.. literally this touched me so deep. Strong females always win
wtf tb, this video scared the sht out of me...reminded me of those horrendous gone wrong plastic sugerie
New fan here but so so so here to support you and send good energy! Much love 💜
I saw a video on tiktok of him drinking at a party with a bunch of girls, he’s such a child.

You are so strong ❤️❤️ keep going !!
So proud of you Shyla 💕
You are beautiful inside and out!!!! So strong!!😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺🥺
❤
I’m never watching this ever again in my
Yes, Shyla! Just yes 💖💖💖
It can be so hard to walk away. YOU ARE STRONG AF!
This made me cry your are such and Inspo to me ❤️
Let me tell you something...God will do everything in his/her power to remove you from a toxic situation if you don't want to leave. The universe will put you through, what seems to be the worst experiences of your life. But, in reality it's just God forcing you to remove the bad so you can move to your light! At the time it seems awful, but it's a blessing when you get to your purpose, because you realize without that pain you probably would have still been in that situation. I can now see a glow in you! You were always beautiful but now the light is shining from within as well. I am so happy for you and your journey to come. I'm sending all positive vibes your way, and may the rest of your days be filled with prosperity and utter happiness. God bless you mama❤
So inspiring thank you for being you 💗
The smile on your face when you're talking about your brand and how you're proud of yourself is everything :)
You finally found yourself Shyla and so did I ! I know how exactly you felt. Tears ran down my cheeks as I watched this and back track to everything I passed through and starting over. I'm happy you have your daughter that keeps you even more stronger. Unfortunately, I was left absolutely with nothing and just had myself.  It has been 3 years but sometimes it feels as if it was yesterday and I'm so sorry but I think I'll forever hate that person for causing me so much pain, trauma, depression, anxiety etc... sometimes as women we take too much and say less. We keep everything inside and even tho I've moved on  It's something you can erase and sometimes you get flashbacks. We're here for you Shyla! ❤
So happy for YOU in the place you are now.  Wish you all the success in the world!!!!
Glad you got away from the Ace Family and all their drama. Also the people who attacked ti were little kids. Grown ass people don’t have time for that bullshit.
HAPPINESS. That is all I feel for you and your baby girl. 🤎
You are strong brave and powerful. You are amazing
ladies and gentlemen... shes back and shes better then ever.
Can't wait for part 2. We love to see women thriving ESPECIALLY after all the trauma and terrible events.
I LOVEEEE YOUR MONEY TREE ❤️✨💸💸💸💸
You’re amazing, that’s it❤️
Woman power !! You got this girl 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
lol who cares babe, jus shake dat and make my day sweety
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates -🎈
I’m happy you bounced back and are doing better! I thought it was Unnecessary to show clips of others bashing Landon. I understand he will always be a part of your story but we want to see Shyla content only! If you are stronger and better than no need to mention him. May God continúe to bless you and your daughter with many more great things!!
Shyla is WINNING! 🙌🏼
Jesus loves you! Happy New Year. God Bless!! https://youtu.be/n-tzRmRZXQE
I could definitely relate the pain you are going through it wasn’t easy but you made it. So as we can too. I am proud to be a single mom too.
her story reminds me so much of the book "it ends with us". we love you shyla & forever stand with you <33
Yessssss you , Mama !!!! Keep looking forward 🙏🤍
I miss your old teeth 🦷
Girl we have your back! Most of us bailed on them. The truth is coming slowly but we all know already. Those people are evil con artists. They will get their Karma. The entire family is toxic. It all starts with the momster though. She effed up those men. Not that its any excuse for the pieces of turds they CHOSE to be. I was raised by a sociopath who beat the tar out of me. I CHOSE to be a gentle parent. These two men have CHOSEN to be crud. They lie like its air. I feel so bad for the kids. Because they avoided it this time some how, though the battle over that house is far from over. Rumor is they are renting. lol The house of cards is falling is the ACE is already buried. But KNOW we have your back. We believe YOU. We KNOW  you are telling the truth. And if I see one bully on this page its going down.  You keep fighting girl, you are going to take off with your brand and your dream and give Souline a wonderful life. You already did the best thing you could have for her. ESCAPE. You didnt let them manipulate you into being crazy. I hope karma is swift for all of them (is the dad crappy too? I havent seen anything about him he also seemed nice).Thanks SL04N for letting us know and as always being a fighter for the victims. Shyla nothing but love and light to you. Keep going you have this.Looking forward to the next video. Has anyone ever told you that you are really good at talking about what happened. I dont want to say telling a story to give any room for doubt, but you have a way of conveying emotion but not cracking.
Shyla,when u read hate comments,just remember your better then that and your not the one hiding behind a screen hating on someone,your a strong willed mom that dosent give up,sometimes its rough but u cant be stuck in the maze forever. ❤All the best 4U2👩‍👧
What Catherine could have been but she decided to live her miserable life with her cheater! I’m rooting for you Shy!!
I don’t know you that much Shyla, however watching this video feels like it’s a documentary on Netflix. thank you for sharing your story, I went through a similar thing as you. I am a single mother of an 8 yr old and let me tell you it is TOUGH! But not impossible  it made me cry when you said you didn’t know your strength til now. love you girl! thank you for sharing your story
Wowww
I’m with u shyla 1000% ❤️❤️
I support you so much 🥺❤️
You got this !!! your Beautiful, Talented,   Smart & Strange ❤🙏
hurts when you feel so connected to the message of a video but realize its split into two parts for profit and benefit of the creator not the public learning from the information. will never be able to wrap my head around consumerism or ad sense. my appreciation for the emotions I attach to certain videos feels unmeasurable and non comparable to a price tag. I needed this. eye-awakened. inspired. I feel heard. thank you shyla! but I really needed to hear the whole thing, not parts. I am fragile. abuse is so sensitive and not something that should be profited from especially when you are trying to help others escape from abuse.
Waiting for Catherine to wake up and do the same thing as Shyla but I doubt that will ever happen....
This is so inspiring 💯💯💯
What else happened don’t leave us Hanging
I am so inspired by you.  I LOVE YOU ! 💕
They like to say history repeats itself.
Mixed feelings I watched L&S from the beginning and now I’m watching her tell her story and him tell his story and we all know that there’s his side her side and the truth. I think it’s great that she has made something of herself and moved on from a relationship that she no longer felt like she was thriving in. I do however I have questions as to why either one of you has to drag the other through the mud to move on. I think you should both take a deep breath and realize you have a child and the only thing that should matter in your world is that little girl. Her health her safety her happiness is all that should matter she needs a mom and her dad if they’re both available. I was a single mom I raise my son he’s now 27 years old he’s in the Navy for seven years he’s married with my grandson and I couldn’t be prouder but we struggled I worked a lot to make things work for him that’s just what you do. I hope that your future is bright and amazing and everything you want it to be and I hope that your little girl is lucky enough to continue to be loved by both sides of her family.
Keep going girl..you got this!!.💕
This video is EVERYTHING!! Your resilience is inspiring! thank you for sharing. I can't wait for this new chapter in your life!
Go Off Shyla you & your baby deserve to be happy. I'm rooting for you!!

Oh my god! I literally love you soooo much. For some reason I always felt like you were just a real ass strong female. I’m so sorry for the stuff you had to go through, but just the way you keep fighting. It’s so admirable. I truly hope 2022 is a time for healing and growth for you. 💗 love you so much little Libra babe and hope you have a fantastic day

💓💓

You can’t pleas everyone make everyone happy
I’m so proud of you of everything you have over come over the short period of time, all at once. Good job for getting strength and moving on because I know it’s hard Moving on from we’re use to.
The Queen is back 🥺🥺😍😍😍
I remember right before Shyla announced she was pregnant, I had asked her on twitter when she would be starting some type of clothing brand & she basically said soon. So crazy!
Girl you're one strong momma. I'm glad you're sharing this story. More of us survivors need to continue to share our stories.
Good to see you back  here 🥰 #StrongWoman 🙏🏽 May God bless u always beautiful 🤗.
Shyla your so beautiful inside & out ! 😍 you inspire me so much , love you girl 🤍
I think at the end of all of this she’s going to be the most realistically stable compared to the ace fam and his brother. Financially, emotionally, and physically. She’s actually trying to go about her and her kids life the right way. I wish everything could work out for everyone but seems like this girl has her head on straight the most.
👏👏👏love this you go queen 👑
Everything happens for a reason, you are blessed to have your beautiful healthy baby. I support you 💕 take care of yourself for you and for your baby. Stay bless!
We love uuu
It’s so crazy as a woman frowning up I also witnessed my mom go through abuse … and I hated men for a long time I shoes away and somehow ended up in a relationship with a guy for 8 years and he did everything I feared and I didn’t see it until 8 years later and I snapped almost as if I woke up out of nowhere …… I wish I would have seen it earlier to have my youth back but I know it made me a stronger person . And now I know what I want and what I deserve but anywho just crazy how anyone who seen growing up around abuse somehow goes towards it still without even realizing smh.
88 is going to be bigger than skimz I can feeeel it babe!!!!¡!!!!
You are a amazing girl!!!!!!!! you are going to absolutely kill it !!!!! Massive supporter of yours from England my name's Leesa and I can't wait to see you make a empire for you and your beautiful daughter xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx you don't understand what you have done for so many women shyla words can't express how amazing you are!!!!!!!!!!

@shyla this is exactly what happened to me I felt when you said “ how did I try so hard to avoid making the same mistakes or finding my self in the same situation as my mother was in, but ended up in something similar”  or worse in my case .. but we must be proud we got out of that and moved for ward for us and our kids. ❤️❤️🙏 great job love !

So Shyla is a fashion designer
I love you Shyla since day one!!! I’m a fan. 🥰 I know you can do more better to yourself and to souline. We are so proud of you for the things you have been done. 🙏🏻
I’m confused I thought Landon bought her an SUV and also what happened to the YouTube money was it not in the bank?
We love you Shyla!
I love you Shyla !
This is a beautiful and truthful video. I’m happy for all you doing because it takes a lot of strength to get through all of that. Love to you and your family! Can’t wait to see what you have in store 🤎

Love you Queen ❤❤

🤍
You are such an inspiration. To all women. I can’t wait to watch part two 💜
I'm so proud of you Shyla...what you went through was so traumatic and difficult and I'm so happy that you are in a better place with yourself and your family. I am excited about part 2 and can't wait...love you Shyla💕❤️🙏 May God bless you and your family
You and Your Daughter Deserve the Best and to be Truly Loved! 💕
Wow!!! I saw Shyla wear so many designer bags while she was with her daughters dad I assumed she was doing so well! But she admits to having to stay at her friends house with her daughter.  She didn’t have what I assume, the money to get her own place but a ton of designer bags!   Social media really truly is so false. I commend shyla for putting her story out there and showing the world that no one’s life is perfect not even the lives of the people that are on social media flaunting and pretending to be happy
Shyla I love you so much. You’re the woman I aspire to be. You’re incredible, I am so proud of you and its amazing to see you doing wonderful and smiling and LAUGHING! You’re an incredible individual, please do not forget that. Sending love and wishes for you and Soul to stay healthy!
💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷💕🌷
Wow.  Can you just imagine how many people you have inspired! And are currently looking up to you.. me being included!  You’re such a strong women! It’s really beautiful to see you grow and blossom into your own independent self and I know that must feel hella amazing ❤️  People who haven’t experienced the trauma that comes after getting separated from a toxic relationship like this, probably won’t ever understand.  It’s really sad.
Love this much honestly! Hearing your story since you started posting by yourself has honestly showed me I’m not by myself I’m a mother of two and is going through rough patches with their father where I don’t know what do at times because there it times where everything is laughter and playing and there is times where something or anything ticks him off and it’s just downhill screaming calling me names saying everything is my fault and for my kids it breaks me because I don’t want them to grow up hearing or seeing that so seeing how your overcoming gives me hope that I myself can make it by myself as well Thank you shyla from the bottom of my heart your inspiring please keep doing more videos ❤️
Wooow so impressive... I'm so proud of you shyla... I know you'll be the best mom to your daughter and i pray everything you've gone through doesn't happen again and i pray if anything happens again i pray God will give you strength and hold you through everything 🌼... ❤️
People who resort to social media "influencers" for entertainment, or just satisfying their curiosities, have such low views in my eyes. Go create your story, not someone who manufactured some phony lifestyle that you think should be "your" dream. Everything is fake and scripted. Growing up, I've realized so many losers gravitated towards these sort of things... on TV or social media.
GIRL I AM SO PROUD OF YOU, I KNOW IT WAS HARD BUT NOW YOU LOOK SOO HAPPY, YOUR GLOWING... KEEP DOING YOU. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BRAND, YOU SOO DESERVE IT ❤❤❤
Proud of you❣️
I will never understand how people can send other people DEATH THREATS like wtf if wrong with people. There has to be something seriously wrong with you in the head to do that. That’s not ok.
I wish you and your daughter the absolute best ! ❤️
I love and support you through it all! It was heart breaking to watch go through everything with your ex. I was and am always inspired by you and how strong you are. I’m so Beyond happy and proud of you it’s so amazing to see you happy and smiling and healing. I always knew you’d make it out and no matter what you’d be great and do big things and I love supporting you and soul and watching the things you accomplish. Soul is such a beautiful little girl and she has a strong mother to look up to! She’s gonna be great to! I’m glad things are slowly on track for you I can wait to see what else you do next. Love you shyla !🤍
So proud of you Shyla
independent bad a$$✨✨
John 3:16 For God so loved the world he give his only begotten son,that whoever believeth in his should not perish but will have ever lasting life💙
I can relate to you so much! You got this mama, keep doing you!!
Now this is the shyla we need your an inspiration for all 😍
I’m gonna finish watching this when I got food lol But I’m so proud of you Shyla ❤️ Tell your story! We’ll be right behind you ❤️🙏🏼
Wow your story is so interesting and inspiring ♥️
Love this! I know everything will turn out great for you! 🤍
Im scared to hear the rest .. I know you were in a dark hole for a while and when your sister passed away it made everything worse . Ur a strong women God bless you forever
Here for you!
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Bro Landon was going thru cancer dude. That’s a bigger problem than u having a baby dude
Growing and glowing hun .. you guys will be just fine... You are strong, keep your head up and rise. Please don't try to please anyone and just be you
💞💞💞💞
To the people saying she’s bashing him.. I don’t think it’s about bashing. She’s talking about her experience and bringing awareness to these kinds of situations. Y’all always see the negative when anyone wants to speak up about a hurtful situation.
😊😊😊
I just love u so much
These toxic men are jealous of beautiful women like you. They literally pursue women to ruin their life. Sounds like they want to be a woman or in the closet.
I wish u post more videos about u .. ur really interesting to see & cute 🧚🏻‍♀️
Wow I am so proud of your fight and strength. I am here for the new chapter of you and baby girl.
Just let it go
Expose them all girl!! Were all here for you, you and your baby deserve so much better!
I went through almost the same wave 🌊 I really needed to hear this. that I’m on the right path of self healing. I’m in the beginning stages of picking myself back up. I definitely took some gasps for not seeing the red flags too. They are so clear but those loverblinds really block your vision.
It’s 2022 why u still bashing him u could of been put this out. Like let it go and move forward .
I’m loving this new real side of Shyla 😊
<3
Shyla you are amazing person don’t give up you will succeed🥰👍
THE COME BACK IS BETTER THAT THE SET BACK , YOU GOT THIS SHYLA 💕💕💕  WE LOVE YOU ❤
I can relate so much. Good for you for being open. Wish you the best!
I wonder where she would be at if she left to London …  Idk I know she has a daughter and I have a son so this isn’t to slander but just imagine where she’d be
What can’t break you will make you stronger
So happy to see you back ❤️❤️
This is so weird shes left him because he's such an abuser but has now made a whole YouTube video about him. Crazy vibes
We love you, Shyla!  I’m so glad to see you finally happy!  Only positive vibes!
I LOVE YOUR AUTHENTICITY! CHEERS TO YOU , BELLA
❤️
You’re energy has changed immensely in the best way! I’m so happy for you Shyla! <3
So proud of you Shyla! Somehow, when we think we're running from our toxic past, we're actually running towards it. I did the same thing. You've got this. You have the awareness and that's why you'll be okay. You're a great momma. Keep going honey ❤️ there's a lot of us out here willing to talk and we understand

You're strong & your story is your truth! Block out all the extra noise, just focus on a life for you and your beautiful daughter. We all know these fake just for show dads when we see them. :)

WE LOVE YOU, we are here to support you!! Every step of the way!! 💕

Glad to see you back gorgeous ♥️ “Follow your passion & it’ll lead you to your purpose” so beautiful, I’m taking those words with me!
were always way too good for him
Shyla came back stronger & powerful💪🏻❤️
Why are we still talking about this? She’s made her point and shared her story a million times…
Wow, this video was everything. I’m so happy for your Shyla you are THRIVING! I’m here for these videos 🤍
I’m so glad to see you thrive and be back queen  👑
Well , first of all I don't know why everyone is so proud of you.! Excuse me ? We don't follow someone without knowing them . And if we follow them and they don't follow us back that means they're not interested in us right ? And why will they knock us or text to go on a date ?  And secondly shyla ! No one knew you before this relationship right ? In the very first of this video you clearly said that you're not interested in YouTube channel or you didn't know much about YouTube right ? Then after sometime you said you're terrified of losing YouTube forcefully and also you said that you're convinced that if you didn't have YouTube you wouldn't be successful . So my point is shyla the attention seeker , please stop showing yourself a victim and seeking people's attention so that you can be famous and successful individually . The fact that why you're making Landon and his family a villain is you've always wanted to be more successful and famous than them individually . That's you did all of this drama so that you can put them in the negative role and you become angel in people's eyes and you can achieve everything you want from your life .  So please stop this victim drama and stop making others villain !
I love this I’m so happy for you Shyla. I support you 💯 and wish you the best. I pray God continues to guide you and give you the strength you need each day!! 🙏❤️💪🏼
so proud of you!!! you’re so strong. there’s always light at the end of the tunnel, you found the light. you deserve to be treated like a queen, much love girl. ❤️❤️
Ughh this made me tear up 🥺 so inspirational. You’re so strong, your daughter is going to be so proud of you 🤎
Shyla I honestly can’t stop tearing up and smiling, I’ve always thought you were the most beautiful and honest women on YouTube, still being in an abusive relationship for almost 10 years and have 2 children together and feeling depressed for so many years and a failure, I can relate to you so much.I admire your strength and giving women like us so much courage, because nobody understands it until you live it. I love you girl! thank you thank you thank you. ❤️
So excited for your journey mama 💕
Girl, I am so glad you’re back! Andddd so much better 👌🏻 I hope you don’t ever allow any toxic to come around you ever again because happiness looks amazing on you. This Shyla is the shyla we’ve been waiting to see, the REAL you! ❤️❤️

Am watching I wonder how long you will play this Landon did this Landon did that card. It's so old and cold
Of course she’s stunning but her energy and personality is sooo beautiful 👍
Her teeth done ?
❤❤❤
Love that she is not saying his name saying the guy she was dating. Don't give him anymore clicks the fact he tried to post same day & was his "truth" clickbait smh.. glad I didn't watch it she has like 1mil his video 260thousand lol
Bramty litteraly said landen stole her idea and she feel sorry for his wife 🙄
SL04N! ❤
🤍✨
This just shows how much growth you’ve had and how much he hasn’t … he’s still living for the drama and you’re thriving my love x
Your a bad ass women the way you pick your self up n carry your self keep it up
JESUS said :  LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD, WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.  THIS IS THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT.  MATTHEW 22 : 37 - 38

Love this, & the visuals are just 🔥🔥🔥
I'm so glad you're back and doing amazing things . Keep it up Shyla

Sending hugs ❤️
❤️❤️
So happy for your brand!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ excited for part 2
I’m here for it all! I can’t wait to see you grow as a independent person and not have any of those negative people in your life ❤️ you deserve more
This is amazing keep posting !!!
Since you're being so "transparent", why can't you admit that you were toxic too. If you could cuss his mother out on camera, I can't imagine what you were doing off camera. There's strength in admitting that you were in the wrong too.
Seems like she has moved on and that’s great since the relationship was toxic. I just wish she would stop playing the victim. She seems way stronger and more aggressive than Landon could ever be. Take accountability for the role you played in the relationship, get help so you don’t repeat your patterns in behavior and choices so your daughter can see what a healthy loving relationship is. Wishing you the best.
So proud of you mama❤️I have learnt through this
I feel like most of us ladies have gone through some type of abuse in most of our relationships and we all at one time thought it was okay and that it was normal. But overtime we got fed up and realized everything they did to you was unacceptable and not normal. It took me over 7-8 years to realize abuse in every form. From physical to mental I’ve had it all and I let so many people use me because I thought as long as they claimed to love me that they did love me.
Your smile is everything Shyla <3 Im glad ur in a better place now. We love you and we are with you no matter what
This video made me happy. You go girl
The way you hold yourself together, wow. A strong woman. Always here for you. YOU ARE SO LOVED BY OUR FATHER IN HEAVEN❤
Same girl same 💔 but I fr have nothing like 2,000 and living at my moms Rn and a baby boy on the way 😩😪
Sort a real life version of the book It ends with us.!! Damn.

Shylaaaa!!!! Omg congrats on healing, loving yourself, and returning to your normal life. You are so strong and we believe YOU. Stay strong queen❤❤
Forever supporting you! 🤍🤍
We love you Shyla 💖
An encouragement to all women, never ever ever reduce yourself to fit into someone else's narrative. You are a force and a queen you were made to be strong and fierce keep wearing your crown. We are here to cheer you on!!!!
So proud of you beautiful girl💜
Dont even look like the old Shyla
So proud and happy for you. I know 2021 was tough. But I know your sister is watching over you. Praying this year is your year Shyla!
You got this mama!! I’m so proud of you ♥️
I think she was so unhappy with Landon that we didn’t see the real Shyla.. and I am obsessed! I’m like sign me up to buy whatever she is making to support this!!! I’m a single mom of 2 and it’s so hard
It’s so hard to accept your narrative when you literally don’t have any receipts to back up ANY of your claims. Landon responded to your video and he presented a lot of evidence to debunk your lies. I think you’re really the crazy and manipulative one. For the sake of your daughter, I really hope this isn’t true but I guess only time will tell.
Shyla, you are the strongest person ever. So proud of you.
❤ Beautiful truth finding ourselves. After a 10.5 storm.
Love this!! 😘
Great video!!  Really inspiring me to stay on my grind!! Love seeing your daughter clips especially that on your hip move. That's when she's heavy but you don't want to put her down move cuz you love holding her lol hahaha
Love you Shyla
❤️
Strong and full of strength our Shyla 🤍
You're a super human for many, many women and I hope you really know it ❤
Keep going
Yessss
Omg 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg i loveeee this
love u!! (:
So proud of the woman you are coming, truly an inspiration. We are here for this Shyla! ♥️
Catherine - She did it. So can you.
Love you Shyla you got this

You go girl!!
❤️ you Shyla!
🖤🤍🤎💜
ilusm….
Hi Shyla!!! Nice to have you back ❤️❤️
♥️♥️♥️♥️🙌🏻🙌🏻
Hey shyla,  I been watching you you from the start. I want to be honest here, I thought you and your ex were happy. I actually was in a toxic abusive relationship for 7 years of my life and when I watched you guys it made me smile....little did I know.   After watching your videos I noticed you didn't seem as happy as your previous videos ....then I still watched because I felt something off and finally I said to myself someone is going through what I am and it's going to be okay...I prayed for you ...for all us woman to face the truth and we did.  I am proud you spoke up about this situation because it happened but doesn't make us less than who we truly are.   Ive realized I've shut my emotions off because in my case I never got a closure.   At the end of the day, we are who we are. We learn and trust God. God has made this happen to us for our best interest....you'll see.  I still love watching you
Wow I Loved this! Go YOU🔥🔥🔥 GREAT editing!
I love you Shy, so much I’m beyond proud of you! You are such a huge motivation to me and so many other women ❤️
Sending you hugs queen !❤️
She looks really happy I love that smile ❤️💙 keep thriving Shyla!!
New single mom and awww man just wanting to do great so your kids can live the life they deserve is what overwhelms me just want to give her the world . I can't wait for my uno reverse card and for my life to start falling into place .
This video inspired me🤍✨
Baby girl you are thriving ✨
Love you Shyla, you’re so brave 🖤🖤
This gave me chills, it honestly resonated so much and reminded me of my own situations in the past, I am so proud of you shyla and you are such a compassionate and beautiful soul. Inside and out you are so beautiful and I could see it since day 1 of watching your videos from the past. You did NOT fail soul, you’re fighting a generational demon so she won’t EVER have to. I love seeing you heal more and more and I am sending you both so much love and abundance💗
You Go Girl! Go get your dreams for you and your daughter!!! We are rooting for you!!!!♥️
<3 You got this loves whatever you put out gonna be great keep your head up loves! You're great and very loved <3

Your videos are different and you’re changing it up in an amazing way. No offense to LM- he’s on the same shit he always was. It Uninspired. Like chilling with his boys making jokes about getting girls. we don’t care. You are doing something!! I think it’s ok to love u both - that’s why we loved this is l&s because we loved you both. I don’t feel like we should have to “choose” but watching you both it’s so clear.
Girl you are glowing and I’m here for it!!! Sending love from me and my son 🤍
your so strong, lots of love ❤️❤️❤️
So proud of you shyla😭💜
We love to see a thriving Queen~! Glad you left that toxic and abusive individual. You're going to do great things~! Bless!

I wanna see your brand! You’ve always been an inspiration honestly, so excited for this new journey of yours 🤍 also the way this video was filmed, I appreciated it!! ✨
I love this for you 💕 Congratulations on this healing journey. God continue to cover over you and your family.
I’m a firm believer that being with and around the wrong people will block your blessings. God pulled you away from your previous situation for a reason. Be thankful for that 🙏🏾❤️
We luv u Shyla I can’t wait for pt2 wanna know how u did it all ur strong
Can you just stop talking bad aboit each other. Just breakup peacefully ,you are the whole parents And you once loved each other This is not okey There is no a perfect relationship  But if you fail a relationship Just move on OMG
I am so proud of her ❤️
I understand you love and believe in you ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you thank you thank you for being so strong and sharing your story❤️ This was such an encouragement to hear because I am full time single mother of 2 going through the same situation and this journey has been so hard and at times isolating and discouraging. Hearing your sorry gives me hope and joy knowing that so much better will come out of all of this and that I am capable, strong , independent and that I will get past this hardship❤️ Praying for you and souline as you continue to grow and heal in all aspects and praying many blessings❤️
Always knew you could do better 🥺 you motivate me to do better 🥰

So happy for you Shyla! Relationship wise i went through a similar situation with a narcissist and after a few months i feel sooo much happier, my kids are doing so well and i had no idea what to do with myself but everything is falling into place and i have no regrets! It’s my second time being a single mom and I’ve never happier or more motivated to move forward in life with my 2 kids! We can do what we set our minds too
Shyla honestly you are the biggest inspiration! Seeing how far you come is amazing!!!! 💛💛💛
We love you girl! Stay strong ❤️ GOD Got you ✝️🙏🏼💫✨
Blessings in diguse
We love you Shyla! So proud of you for standing up for yourself & your baby. For being a good role model for younger girls. You should be proud of yourself & everything you’ve accomplished so far. This is only the beginning.

Love u girlie
weeeeee loveee yooooou
So much inspiration💗 you are the reason we keep pushing, you have showed us how strong you are and that all women can be just as strong if they work for it and have hope
I admire you so much. You’re so strong to get out of the relationship. I hope I can be the same.
I STAN Shyla, drop your merch girl! I’d buy it 🤍
WE LOVE YOU GIRL ❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯
Mcbrooms seem like such greasy scumbags.
So extremely proud of you, you are amazing
I always loved your energy I never got why people hated you so much I’m so glad you got out of that relationship I happy for you and your daughter
Love you Shyla! 🥰
So inspiring 💜
I really hope she continues to grow in this world. I want her to be way more successful than when she was in L&S. I want her to make it in this world I really do.
You are so powerful and I’m here for it ❤️
Waiting for the part 2🙋🏽‍♀️🙋🏽‍♀️!! You're so strong, so beautiful. I'm glad you've stood your ground!
Girrrrrl so fukin good to see you back! Big ups to you māmā
Calm down you’re not no damn celebrity girl !
She’s healing , I’m so happy for her 🥺
you are beyond strong. beyond. i feel hurt for you and just wish you didn’t have to go through everything you have gone through, and for you to not meet indescribable cruel people. but we sadly had to see all this coming. souline’s father even stated that he wanted to be JUST like his brother.. and he got his wish. but you are so incredibly strong and brave, that you got yourself and your child out of the way and house. away from all of those evil people and now you feel SAFE. you may have to start from the ground up, but there’s no limit on your success. i will always support you shyla. i’m so proud of you. 💗
Thriving❤️
You are better off single and powerful than with the wrong guy! This is so inspiring. You got this. I wanna see you win that humanitarian award! Do this for all of us, so that it would motivate us too 🙏🏽
I LOVE YOUU ❤️
SHE IS GLOWING AND I LOVEEE IT
SHE IS SO BEAUTIFUL 😍😍
Love this! 💖
You go girl 🙏🏽🤍
Get it girl
You’re gonna surpass everything you felt like you couldn’t. It’s your time. ✨
People judging you is a reflection on them, not you. Im so sorry you went through this, happy people aren’t mean to others.
You’re Strong ❤️
Beautifully like always. Your soul is literally Souline. May god keep blessing you & all your family Shyla. I relate at some point & for you to simply share your experiences & open up shows how much you can spread to others & show there is a f** light at the end of the tunnel.  Keep shinning , keep thriving , yes you deserve whatever you manifest.  Love the money tree!             Much love Kat
I miss you so much I love you I'm happy yu are back love you 🥰🥰🥰
This video is inspiring ❤️❤️❤️ love you shyla
YOU ARE GOING TO IMPACT THE WORLD 🌎 and become the greatest you e ever been
WE LOVE YOU SHYLA!!! Your strength is admirable you are going to become great! We are so proud of you 🤍✨
Your story of your relationship issues are so relatable. You are going to inspire a lot of people. Good for you for being brave enough to share it.
You got this Shyla! I can’t wait to see you for you and all that you will accomplish. I’m so happy you are no longer associated with the fake-ness and phoniness of your former relationship’s family. I can’t wait for the world to know who they really are.
This was open my eyes help me in my situation so many people are stuck in this you sayin this helps so many people that are in relationship like this
Is it just me or does something look different about her. Idk if it’s her nose, lips or teeth..still beautiful just different
Shyla is glowing so beautiful, she looks happy. Girl know we are here for you!
your daughter is going to remember your struggle and thank you for it for being strong and for protecting her from a shitty abusive life she’s going to see you as someone not to mess with you got out thats all that matter its so crazy how common this behavior is with men like they feel so entitled of your being when really we are much more than them!
youre so strong and powerful
I clicked on this video thinking it was really about Shyla but she cannot do a video about herself unless she trashes Landon
WOW SO PROUD OF YOU! You are going to achieve and go far for you & your baby girl! You got this! Keep pushing! I look forward to seeing what you accomplish and seeing your brand!
Im speechless…. Shayla I’m just…. Without words, you’re beautiful & so strong! You got this babydoll. You keep it up ❤️❤️❤️
Sorry but when the clip of her and Landon together popped in my heart sank
This was definitely moving ., i feel like i can be someone and not have to fear anymore 😩❤️
We love you Shyla! Your a very strong women 🦋❤️
like a phoenix rising from the ashes. I cannot wait to see where you go and how you continue to inspire those around you.🤍
Go girl 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Wow. Extremely relatable. Teen mom here who went thru a lot of the same things. Your testimony is a beautiful one. Keep going
You’re doing great, you didn’t need to drag Landon still.
I think shylas trying to bash her baby daddy . She odviously doing it for clout … bahahah
You are amazing
A whole queen. You’re doing so good girl.
Girl....Im here to support YOU! im so so so glad youre out of that toxicness.... Continue to stay true to yourself and God will continue to bless you. thank you for being so real in this video.
Your very humble and very bright and beautiful  You should feel very proud of your self   You talk with loved and respect ✊  You are truly one of kind keep being you never changed who you had become never stop putting tho you are shined as bright more you  Push tho more you come out looking like a beautiful flower like you should of been 💗😌
Am I the only one who thinks Shyla is so beautiful without makeup I don't know what it is but she's beautiful always but without makeup I'm just like wow
Just keep doing u and always pray and u keep going
You are such an inspiration to sooo many women and I think that makes you a superhuman in it’s self. More than anything your daughter is the luckiest girl to have such a strong independent woman as her mother and role model!
Shyla, it’s so refreshing to see you in another light. 🦋  ✨ looking forward to your content!
I’m sure you were abusing him.
Love you Shyla and Soul🪐🤍🤍
GO SHYLA❤️❤️❤️
❤❤
So proud of you Shyla!! 🥺💕
But Shyla, YouTube is still something you do. You’re giving us stories of your life now
Idk you but I’m so proud of you 🦋🧿
Shyla I don’t know you and you don’t know me but I’m so f****** proud
These really made me cry and I can see in the old videos you where not being yourself and I prayed for you bc ik something was going on between your relationship something like these is hard bc people wanna make up lots of scenarios and you’re putting your life out their where people judge you 🥺Ik everything is going to get better just believe in god put everything in gods hands I love you ❤️
She deserves more views ! Way more
Here she goes trying to play the victim again. I thought this was over. Landon showed receipts and ended it and shes still going. You guys were both a lil wrong in sum situations
Yes Shyla ! Keep going and you have a reason which is your daughter. God allows battles to his strongest soldiers💪🏼💪🏼
Im so happy for you Shyla you are a great person and a great mother good things will come to you🙂❤
I knew you would come out with legging sooner or latter because of how much you would always wear them ❤️❤️love you girl ❤️ I’m proud of you ❤️
YES SHYLA YOU GOT THIS!!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎 CAN’T WAIT FOR THE PART 2 😭😭🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾
You are inspiring so many women.
10:12
It’s so sad … you could see all the love she had/has for him and it’s so sad that Landon let this incredible women go. We all are here for YOU SHYLA
Just want to tell you I’m proud of you for leaving that toxic relationship you were in. I know what it’s like to be in a situation we’re you’re being judged and feeling like you can’t be yourself. I was there and I walked away from it and my life changed for the best. You’re going to be okay. You’re going to do big things. You’re young and beautiful and you can do it all. Never give up on your daughter or you. Take care and have a beautiful life.
Emotional abuse is real!!!! So happy to hear someone acknowledge it and the affects it has on your mental health!!! You are worth it. We see you, we believe you, we are here!!!
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you He die for you and arose to give you life. And still loves you even though you reject him. You beautiful, smart and important  human being 🥰❤❤🙏  Jesus loves you and forgives you for your past choices and mistakes accept him as your Lord and savior before its to late start a relationship with him read your Holy bible, talk to him every day and pray, he is waiting on you with arms stretch wide open waiting for you he would not force himself on you his a gentleman, kind,loving and PATIENCE. Put your trust in Jesus because he is the only one that will never fail You, worship him day and night , be thankful every day despite of😊  Gospel songs Nobody - casting crowns  Michael w Smith- love in his right hand  COMMUNION- TRIBL I THANK GOD - TRIBL  Voice of GOD - Dante Bowe  CHAMPION - TRIBL   There is much more but accept Jesus he loves you and he knows what's best for you, trust his timing, his ways and thoughts are higher than ours😊❤❤💞❤💌💫💫💫💫
Man you and Landon need to grow up into your individual selves and then try again.
Babe im a year out of a narcissistic abusive relationship i hear u i see u i support u and we will be fine baby ❤️❤️❤️ im also a single mom now love we got this u r beautiful Nd ur daughter is gorgeous ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is what Catherine COULDNT do
She’s back and she’s better. Thank you for feeling confident to speaking about your life. It’s truly amazing how a mother gets strength for their kids.♥️
you’re so powerful, ignore the negative comments because you are the opposite of what you’re portraying they’re just insecure about themselves
Proud of you! Wishing you nothing but the best! Health, wealth continued success with your new business venture, achieving your dreams and a happy little Souline! X Big prayers and loves being sent your way xx
I've been searching for you to post a video every single day sense all this happened! Just hoping you're okay and healing, you deserve the world!
I loveddd this video ! I love this new content and lifestyle you are uploading
Great video great things will come your way you look very happy with yourself shine without a man in your life
you go shyla ✨ your amazing 💛🌟
slo4n & danny!✨
YESSS GIRL!! YOU GO GIRL! Women are strong!! So proud of you and routing for you! Keep going 👏🏼👏🏼
You are a beautiful person Shyla ❤  I have always admired you and I could see the treatment in past videos abuse shows even if you try to hide it.
A mother will do anything for their kids. Shyla I am so proud of you, you’re such an amazing mother and woman. I admire you girl, you are amazing.
Proud of you Shyla and like I said, show them who Shyla really is....🤗💗
I watched almost evey video, and was seeing trolls compare you to Catherine and trying to defend you.
Healing looks great on you 🤍
You deserve way much more and better I’m glad your out of this relationship
You are such an inspiration Shyla, can’t wait to support you in every way 🤎
Growing up in abuse makes it hard to recognize when we are going through it. Truest thing life has taught me in my many years on this rock is as long as you get up when you fall, you're not failing your kids, you're teaching them what resilience looks like. They're going to need that. You're giving them that. You're standing up so you're doing just fine. You'll be better now that you don't have negativity in your space. Remember to keep breathing, you got this 👍🏻♥️
I know exactly what you are going through. Thank you for posting this. I can 💯 relate. Prayers sent your way ♥️
You are strong. You are amazing. You will receive so many blessings. God is with you and your daughter ❤️
I'm sure your brand is the best thing you could do,  when you focus your pain and torment in one place it turns out to be a masterpiece ❤️ either kills you or revives you❤️
Happy to see you happy!!!
You are an inspiration to me and many others. You are a bad ass!
But you must stop talking about LONDON he is the father of your daughter....your are a new person...make your self look good for your daughter...LONDON is your past we all know that...we love you...but you must stop talking bad on him please.
Yes do you  !!
You’re glowing!! Free and happy!
When we see abuse as children, we, without realising internalize it. If we don't learn to see abuse for what it is, we can end up in abusive relationships trying to resolve our childhood conflicts with other people. It's familiar to us and we end up attracting it. We think if the person loves us, or tells us he loves us, after being abusive, it's okay. It is not okay and should never be normalised. I feel like you have had therapy since  I can see from what you are saying, you are starting to heal and see things for what they are. I am glad you moved away. Now you can truly shine, heal and who knows, in the future find someone who is caring and loving towards you.
we believe you ❤️
Go Shyla! We are here for you! So proud of you! You are meant to be happy and sometimes until we leave the ppl that don’t make us happy is when we shine!!!
"I knew I was strong, but I didnt knew my own strength until I went through this"   Damn this is so relatable
You're a queen wow
Good for you overcoming wateva  n doing good now but don't make it out as if Landon was the monster
I’ve been through a lot of trauma having five kids! My marriage was awful and dangerous as well!!! I know how to tell when another woman has gone through the same and I can tell you have! The Ace Family and Landon show how awful they really are! I’m glad you are out of it and turning your life around!
Your so beautiful, I’ve watched u then and now.. the internet is just people insecure with themselves attacking someone they envy. I’m so happy for u and continue to shine and glow 😘😘
Even I'm a replica of my mom. Abusive father , Abusive husband.  Tried very hard to stay far faaaarrrrr away but 💔
Hey Shyla!!! Follow ur dreams more videos keep update 👍✌🙏💜💓
Girl to have only 2 videos with 400k plus subscribers! You are already winning
This beautiful lady is going to places, so proud of you Shyla!
First off, Shyla just want you know that whenever you drop that athleisure brand I’m spending all my money on it. Cos what I saw on ur INSTA story was THE DEFINITION of athleisure😍 Secondly, you said ur goal is to win a humanitarian award and u basically want to be a superhero. I just want to say I ALREADY consider you to be a superhero cos u are THE DEFINITION of perseverance and finding a way no matter what. No one truly knows the extent of what you’ve been going through but even from the little u share, there’s no doubt in my mind that your a superhero and I just KNOW souline already sees u as a superhero and will forever see u as one🥺❤️ Sending u much love, happiness, healing, prosperity and success in ur business ventures.❤️
So Proud and Happy for You!!!  And your Princess. You got this girl 💕💕💕💕 your strong,beautiful,and Amazing!!! We love You "BOTH" So Very Much.😍🤗💪😘😘💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖💞💖
You are the strongest person ever. Going through what you went through was a nightmare. But god picked you up and made you start over because you and your daughter deserve such a beautiful life together. Keep doing what your doing shyla we are all supporting you every step of the way. We all love you and your daughter ❤️
so proud of you shell. do what you need to do for your baby girl. I'm sorry for the loss of your sister and just know you are doing the best you can. you got this momma!
Definition of an amazing strong woman.
Girl !You’re a super women already ❤️❤️💪🏻
Girl power✨ that’s the mentality in women no matter how hard you fall you always come back stronger🤍
This video is edited so well it feels like a TLC Documentary lol
Certain angles and hairstyles I swear she looks like Kylie Jenner after Kylie Jenner had her surgery but like Kylie Jenner's absolutely beautiful so I mean that in the best way possible but she is Shyla Walker and she's her own person with her own look and she is fabulous
I'm happy to see u Shayla
Okaaay I see a whole ass documentary
Already looking forward to chapter 2 , love you shyla!!!!!
At this point…it’s a he said/ she said situation. & all it seems is one is going the extra mile to make this messy.
I’m glad that you are able to love yourself and also that you have the courage to leave the situation. so I hope that you can love yourself and to be the person that you want to be
I'm so glad to see you back beautiful
You are strong perfect shyla💖
💪💪💪💪💪❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

He was a punk from the very beginning & from the very first video I watched of you both i could see that. But whats disappointing is that no one around uou could see it and/or said nothing because 💵. Build a tribe of friends you trust Shyla & who dont feed you BS, they will help you and protect you.
❤️
You got this girl!!!
Gotta give thanks to teaspill for sharing ur story briefly. But I’m 100% on board with what ur doing wit yourself and your daughter best of luck and will support you

I’m so proud of you ❤️❤️❤️
I fully understand were your coming from  you made me cry ,Am so happy for you it only get better from here we are all here for you
Part 1? If you’re so sad why do you continue to try to capitalize it. You’re only remaining relevant because you keep talking about the same old drama.
As someone going through a difficult breakup, I resonate with so much said about feeling like I had failed. You have put into words what I haven’t been able to express, thank you. Sending lots of positivity your way and thank you for the inspiration!  This brand tho 👀  (Doubt you’ll see this but why not, inspiration has struck soooo - P.S if you’re ever looking for a virtual part-time assistant, lmk !)
I feel that so many individuals can relate to your story. I commend you for stepping out of that toxicity and speaking up. So many go unheard so thank you. You are already achieving that humanitarian award 🥇 You got this Shyla❤️
Honestly so proud of you 💗
It’s so crazy how much people relate to this and you were getting so much hate for it. Stay strong mama✨ You got this

You are strong Shyla!!
So you can show your child’s face but her own farther can’t that’s not fair
Love you!!!!!
God Bless u Shyla
Your such a beautiful soul! You got this life 💗🙏🏽

We don’t know Catherine’s situation, but if she ever finds herself in a similar situation, i wish she see’s how shylas fresh start bloomed and I hope she knows that if she also has a fresh start, she will be okay & she will bloom🤍

Happy for you that you took care of yourself and baby in the time being away from socials. People and influencers in general need to know that it’s ok to not be ok. You are only human, All that YouTube/IG Fame/Clout is just a speckle of your life don’t let it take over you. It’s business we understand that too. Go on do your thing Shyla!!! Transparent and being real is hard to see or find these days. You are awesome. Can’t wait to see more of your transformation. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ All love.

Okay but same why is this a thing.. after I had my son I noticed so much wrong with my relationship it was crazy how much came to light. Having a baby changes literally everything in your life and how you view things, wouldn’t change it for the world it just makes us so much stronger!

Shyla, I hope you know you didn’t fail Soul. In fact, Soul will grow up and watch these videos and will be so incredibly proud of you. Just like the rest of us.
I never comment in YouTube like never. Listen here I don’t know you and I don’t know your story but you deserve to be at peace and so does your daughter. I sent positive energy  your way and I very proud of you. I hope your ex partner finds peace within himself and that you both can have a civil relationship where your daughter is at peace as well. STAY STRONG!!!!!! I can’t wait to see you flourish….
You can deff feel her peace and sincerity 🤎
F it up and kick butt shyla you got this. I respect the hell out of you, especially when it comes to soul and keeping her behind the camera. I feel like everything you went through you absolutely can do this on your own in a normal way. She doesn't need all the glamor in my opinion, I feel as though you think the same. You have attributes that will only benefit her. Catherine grew up the same but she allows the crap where you don't. Your kick ass shyla
Girl I’m so so so proud of you & the amazing woman you are, mother, daughter, sister & friend! This is just the beginning ❤️🙏🏻
Wow I love that saying follow your passion it will lead you to your purpose.
Shyla, you are a strong powerful woman and you will be the one on top. You are an inspiration.
I love this independent and open Shyla, I love this side of her, I’m only now seeing her personality through this video.  And her smile 🥺
So proud of you it clearly shows you won ♥️ and someone lost
the queen Is back!!!
Not me crying shyla 😭♥️ your strength is beauty. From a young mom I know exactly what you mean when you said you felt like you meant nothing till you had your daughter ♥️ you got a supporter for life right here
I love you for this omg
I love you and could listen to you talk forever! ❤️❤️ So inspirational, strong, intelligent and caring, we love you and support you, thank you for continuing YouTube it would never have been the same without you!!
Yes finally the glow we knew you were meant to have. Its amazing to see the transformation in you Shyla. Cant wait to keep watching and to keep on supporting.
I think what it was too was, she was always compared to Catherine and that’s why she wasn’t able to show who she truly was and what she can offer.
You might get hate for this but stay strong I’m proud of you and happy you are back
Thank you for being so strong for your daughter ❤️
Props to you for having the balls for going through all of this and coming out on top. I honestly wish you nothing but the best in everything you do.
Ready for the website and for your brand to launch, if it’s loungewear ima buyyyy🖤🖤
Your literally a strong women love you! We stand by you 💘💘🤞🏽
“Nothing I had directly done had contributed to me failing” yikes mad victim mentality. I just don’t get the point of this video- it’s a new year you want to talk about your brand but you’re still slamming Landon?? It’s just so messy.
I went through the same as Shyla with my daughter's father, I realized once I had her, I got out of the toxic relationship I was in. Now 5 years later I'm much healthier 😌 and happier.
We are rooting for you beautiful mama! ❤💕😘
Shyyyyyyla!!!🥺🥺🥺 you look happy and healed!♥️🥺
Godddd damnnn!! This shit was so inspirational.
Social media bullying is not okay Why spread hate and negativity You never know what someone else is going through behind close doors
When you started talking about following your dreams and it'll lead you to your life's purpose and how you want to be a humanitarian even though you're not entirely sure just yet how that'll lead you to your life's purpose, it gave me an idea. Maybe your life's purpose and your route to becoming a humanitarian has actually already began when you created your brand? Maybe you can use your brand to help other abuse and DV survivors; whether it's through creating a line that empowers women and helps them see their strength and value, or it's through donating clothes to survivors that are living in shelters, or even donating a portion of the proceeds to causes that can help survivors, etc., I think anything along those lines would be an amazing cause! And honestly you'd be the perfect person and role model for a cause like this; your strength and perseverance is truly an inspiration ❤️
You got this love!❤
We love you shyla ❤️❤️❤️ xx
Everything happens for a reason Things are meant to happen to open your eyes to something great  You inspire me shyla  I can't wait for part 2
Yes queen I’m here for it all speak for us hard working moms out here doing the damn thing fit our little queens we’re raising ! Anything and everything for them 🤞💝🙏🏽

Positive vibes always. Wishing the best for you on your new journey of self love and hi to Soul hopefully we see how much she's grown and you two grow into your own.
Be proud of the women u are today we all love u and god bless❤️❤️❤️❤️
A QUALITY CONTENT WOW
I love your come back. I was one of the people criticizing you in the comments but now I have a completely different opinion about you. Keep going, you are doing amazing, you are amazing!!!😍😍 The best are coming your way. Sending you so much love.
My biggest respects to you, such an amazing mom and human being, sending you all my love and good wishes
we are here for you shyla!! xoxo
My baby was born 11-19-19
This was amazing to watch. You’re an amazing woman and you’re not only making your supporters who are going through something similar proud but your daughter most of all ❤️
I hope you realize & acknowledge how strong and inspiring you are for sharing your story. It can be intimidating and scary to share our times of vulnerability, pain, and abuse especially as women. I was in an abusive relationship last year also and I related to a lot of the things you were saying. As women, the idea of what a relationship should be can very much become distorted by society and we make excuses for men out of love for them. I ignored so many red flags as well and didn’t realize what abuse looked like until I finally took myself out of that situation. Continue using your voice for young women, your story made me shed tears. I pray that you pour that love back into yourself and your daughter & that God blesses the two of you 🙏❤️
I don’t know it you’ll see this, but just know you inspire so many people around you. You’re so strong and Souline could not have gotten a better mother than you. You have everyone’s support and we can’t wait to see what you have for us!!!
Your character is totally different from what you’re saying right now you’re a pathological liar and a abuser
You are amazing! Keep going forward.
Her old nose looked better
Shyla hope it's the time u talk about this man u need to completely move on from him and show us your new chapter in life
Your strength amazes me , like I’m so speechless   in awe of your story and everything .. I am truly so happy for you an can’t wait to see pt2
❤️❤️
I cannot wait to see your brand
I’m so happy for you. You have motivated me to follow my dreams. I love you so much! Thank you and stay blessed
I’m so proud of you! And so excited to see what God has in store for you !
We love you Shyla !! ✨💕
why is she still talking , about him and the situation smh
IM so proud of you girl, you've came such a long way. And might I add you look beautiful hun.
So so proud of you Queen !!!! 👑 sending so much love to you and your beautiful baby❤️❤️❤️
I always knew you were something bigger than youtube
God is so good and your story is evidence of that! Keep glowing beautiful I wish you the absolute best in your life and on this new journey 💕🙏🏽
We end up in the same situation as our parents even though that’s exactly Our worst nightmare we’re so used to it that it almost seems normal especially because it’s not the same “ abuse” as we seen then
That McBroom family is self-centered. You have a good hand on your shoulder. Keep you head up queen 👑
I’m so excited to be here for the beginning of your new journey & so excited to see how far you’re gonna go!
Sis think she a celebrity Lmaoo
I’m proud of you Shyla, congrats on everything you are achieving
❤
Loving the growth, the real you! ✨🤍
Proud of you Shyla 🤍your strength & your determination inspires me ! I’m about to have my little girl any day now and this gives me so much hope to be better for her even if we gotta start from square one . Looking forward to your content & brand !
You are a powerful strong women! ♥️
Hello Syhal you are beautiful woman keep your head up high and be strong for your little princess God bless with good blessings and kisses and hugs ❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻
I’m so happy to see this your Ability to persevere is astounding . Shanice was/is very proud of you. It gives me so much hope to see you doing better and better each time I see you on YouTube . Your family’s beautiful . All the love and respect in the world … xo Milli
Have been a silent watcher for some time and just wanted to say as a woman I’m so proud of you! I love that you are putting your story out. It’s something I would love to do but very afraid of the negativity because of childhood trauma. Good luck on your journey and God has A LOT in store for you!
This is AMAZING!!!!!! We love you Shyla
It is not right to make a child or anyone to feel guilty for you feeling that there the only reason why your here today. You can make someone feeling guilt when you feel that way that is a huge burden. It is totally up to you to have happiness, love and freedom from your decision. Man can will nothing unless he first understood that he must count on NO ONE BUT HIMSELF. Life is a beautiful mess. Life is a gift. You hope to learn grim all the bad you go through is what makes you today. All my love and peace to you❤️
You are such a strong girl🥰
You came out on top. Your an amazing, beautiful woman and I can not wait to see what the future holds for you.
She’s so beautiful
I never really comment on videos I kinda just watch and scroll but THIS Shyla is amazing all I have to say is keep up the work and NEVER  go back no matter what. Big blessings your way!!! 💗💗💗
You're such an inspiring woman! Also what music is used in this video?
So happy for you shyla we're rooting for you and baby souline 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
U go queen!!♥️
I know I’m not the youngest but I’m still dreaming they I want to write a book
You are a super woman Shyla! Truly an inspiration. I continue to pray healing & happiness for you your daughter & family 🤍
❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
Shula you are strong 💪🏼 and keep going don’t stop, for me is the same my kids are my power to be strong
Watching it twice now. I love this Shyla
Dang can't wait for the next one!!! Wish u all the best.
Cant wait to c u continue to grow 🦋
I am so sorry for judging you girl! I was one of the ones who criticized you not knowing a single damn thing, and I had no right! You were going through hell and I was just making it worse by running my lips and with no good reason at all! We had no idea and I'm so sorry. I feel so ashamed of the way I put you down. I feel like such an asshole for that.  I am so sorry for being a part of the toxicity that was part of a cause to some of your pain.
Ok strong women , thank you shyla. I’m going through a break up with a mentally abusive narcissist. I always crawl back to him and he’s stoned cold . I know that he won’t change and he’ll always play the victim card . I’ve been going through suicidal thoughts and anxiety , night sweats , waking up with my heart beating so fast , going through the withdrawal of love . When you said “ how did I end up with a replica of my dad , or what you knew as a kid “ that hit home , because I also have asked that question . My father was abusive , little by little my now ex started becoming abusive . He would punch walls , and literally shatter the wall , he scared me so much . His mom is his enabler , I went through so much more than anyone can imagine . Thank you for this video , it’s so inspiring , to know I’m not alone and that I can also thrive . Thank you so much !!!! 🥺🥺🥺💖💖💖
Shyla I am so proud of you and this channel!💕 I literally have tears writing this cause you’ve been through hell lately. I always thought you deserved better I could just feel it. I love you and cannot wait for part two love always J9
She said so herself on her ig she was afraid to be broke and went from mansions and luxury cars she was afraid to not have that anymore so Landon didn’t want to be with her anymore and she afriad to lose it all so she knew shed get fame and attention off lying about landon . And made it about the safety of their daughter and abuse..she says she wanted a baby prob to tie him down so shed be set for life !! For the love of money is the root of all evil !!!! She couldn’t handle the rejection and the fact he didnt want to be with her anymore because of how ugly she was being and everyone was calling her out on their youtube channel how mean she was and her attitude!! Anyone who falls for her manipulative shit is just dumb 😂
The LORD JESUS CHRIST is returning. Repent of your sins.✝️.!!
I'm proud of you for getting out of that toxic and abusive situation. I never followed your previous channel I never knew about you but I'm now subscribed to Shyla. I'm hoping to watch you grow and heal. I'm looking forward to everything you can achieve.
This is so amazing so proud of you. Hopefully, Catherine has the same Courage 💕
Landon’s gonna come with a response video soon.   I’m so glad you left. I’m so glad you put yourself and your daughter first! ❤️
Pinche toxico
Shyla, You are an amazing person. You will come out on top at the end. You know your worth, you know how to come back after being at your lowest point in life. God has your back mama! Sending you positive vibes and praying for you all time. ❤️❤️
You are sooo gorgeous and you have a beautiful soul!!! Never forget that!!! You are incredible!!😍!!! The haters are just jealous 🥶
When you let go of anything holding you back,  you are now open to new things to come into your life 💛. Great video!
Shyla feels so powerful she will either inspire you or scare you. ♥️♥️♥️
You’re strong girllll!!!!!!😘
I’m so proud of you Shyla. You can see the growth & strength you have now. What the devil means for evil God will use for good. More good always come out of a negative situation. This was your time to focus on your  mental, physical, emotional & spiritual self to get it back together. God never gives us more then we can handle. You’re a beautiful strong women. An I experienced something similar to your situation & im so proud to say I found myself & more this time around. My baby girls are my inspiration. Your daughter sees how strong you are girl. I pray you continue to grow & be the best version of yourself. We can’t be good for our children until we are good for ourselves. We have to know we are strong beautiful women & great mothers❤️💞 we might fall but we always come back standing taller then when we fell. Sending lots of love and positivity your way girl.
Love you Shyla ❤️🙏🏼 so proud of you! God bless your beautiful soul!
I can’t wait to see and support your brand!!
So proud of you ❤️ So Empowering 🥰
This is more motivating than motivationale videos. U are really strong. I'm waiting for part 2
She takes a small truth and extends it.. she had a nanny never cooked and cleaned why is she acting like she was a struggling single mom. And didn’t he have cancer ?!
I’m glad you got to a better place! You are so strong! God bless ❤️ “I can do all things through Christ Who gives me strength” Philippians 4:13
I am so so so proud of you Shyla! Your strength and character is amazing! Good always win !
I sure hope you’re proud of yourself, girlie! Coming from another momma, you are doing great! ♥️
You are a inspiration ✨ thank you for being strong 💪🏼 for women who don’t know if they’re going to make it.

❤️
Sending you so much love.
So happy for you!!!!! Love seeing this Shyla!
Anyone else see Catherine’s Snapchat story about “watch who you watch on this app if they speak about a scary or ugly topic, they believe in what they speak” ? Lol 😭
I believe you!!!
I love shyla! She’s such an inspiration to all single moms out there 💘💘
Love this side of you, wow, you as a channel by yourself is what I’m living for ♥️ moms unite and being a full time mother/business women/ independent women is the most amazing thing and watching this video put into perspective that I’m doing ok ♥️ Shyla you are amazing 😻
So happy for you mama!!! Keep shinning for your baby girl and yourself ✨🤍
I am actually crying watching this whole video. I don’t know how she held back her tears but she is so brave and tough. I wanna believe in her. I have always been wondering what she is doing now and she is going about everything. I hope and wish her all the success because before they ended their channel, I knew something was happening, that something is wrong, they were acting strange and keep changing their stories. I did not know what to think or believe. I can see that it was difficult for her because, I lost so much in my life, I felt my life was over and I also lied and kept stuff hidden from my family and friends. I lost everyone in my life. Could only imagine how Shyla as a single mom, had trust in someone who hurt her. 🥺💔🙏🏻
Yes yes yes!! Yes girl!! This is what happens when you’re genuinely a good person - you’ll always come out on top!! Drop that site girl, I’m ready to buy!
you’re absolutely gorgeous!!!
Love you so much 🥺
I love you so much Shyla 🥺🥺I admire you a lot stay strong and sending blessings to you and ur beautiful baby 💜💜💜💜
Put this on Netflix 😩
Sooooooo proud of you 👏  You never gave up despite feeling buried 6ft under! This experience made a better person out of you! Sending you and Soul all the love, support and happiness!
Shyla there’s no need for you to show the videos with Landon all over again. No point. Just share your story.
Waiting for your nxt video eagerly😂😂😂😂😂😂yeaaahhhh
Never give up shyla. We trust you don’t give a f***ing shit. Just continue a new life. We love love ❤️❤️❤️
You got this Shyla !!
You should write a book Shyla ❤️❤️❤️❤️ your such a inspiration! And you’ve come so far and have been thru so much! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 your strong! And you deserve so many great things! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
YOU ARE SO STRONG. YOU ARE SO WORTHY KEEP GOING AND STAY VIBRATING HIGH
Girl nd I loved the set you had on 😍😍 nd I was even looking for the brand online couldn’t find anything now ik why😭
AND YOU FOUGHT AND YOU WON THE FIGHT!! BLESSINGS ON TOP OF BLESSING AND PRAYERS FOR SHYLA🙏🧿🧿🧿 YOU GAVE ME MOTIVATION!!
Rooting for you, and I pray for you & your daughters healing🙏🏼🤍
I love this ♥️ your strong ! Your beautiful you are a WOMAN ! 💪🏼
This is beautiful Shyla.
At the end of the day content will be content. I feel you Shyla... I know things must have been happened to you but let's not act like we don't see how you are trying to gaslight the public with this video. Starting with the videos of you and Landon when things were Rosy and ending with the media bad reports of him. The part you said things that you could have backed up with facts are where you don't give receipts. Y'all had your faults and you are just playing the game of who should the blame be turned on.... Y'all should at least consider baby soul. Both you and Landon are messed up in the head fr fr
we with you all the way
Can’t wait… where do I buy anything to support you!
❤️
I honestly cant forget how bad the bullying on youtube got for her, like every little thing… to the point where I just stopped wanting to watch their channel bc people were just nitpicking at the smallest things FOR NO REASON forgetting she’s a human. Definitely hope those ppl see & feel some type of guilt for not knowing everything & adding onto the worse time of her life. You truly deserve all the blessings & happiness coming your way💙 no hard feelings for both you & Landon, hoping the best for you both for SOUL’S sake 🥺💙
YES BABY GROWWW
Stay true shyla 🥰🥰🥰
You are so strong Shyla! And are beautiful inside and out.
I can relate … things will get better ❤️‍🩹
We had our daughters the same year same month my daughter is just a day older then souline
So proud of you. You gonna go places
I can see the light in your eyes, the glow in your spirit. You are a warrior
Love you! ❤️
As a woman and a mother of 3 little ones going through the same situation, I couldn’t help but tear up and realize how strong we are as women❤️ so proud of you Shyla
follow your passion, it will lead you to your purpose. I love this saying, im writting it down in my journal. I feel Shyla thank you so much for this and opening up but also showing the importance of healing from our childhood trauma ourselves so it doesnt go to our offsprings.
I’m so proud of you Shyla for pushing through and never giving up your inspiring so many women like myself to continue on no matter what the circumstances are God has big plans for you beautiful 🥰
Shame on anyone who comes after her
we love you
Your a true fighter!
You’re so strong & such a role model. I wish the best for you & Souline!! Much love xoxo ♥️
I am so happy to see your beautiful face again! I’m so proud of you Shyla. You’re strength and resilience is UNMATCHED! 💞
you are one of the greatest most strongest empowering influencer I know. god has so many good things and blessing for you and your daughter, and your goals <3. shyla we are here for you beautiful !
I know EXACTLY how she feels when she said that she tried SO HARD to not go down the same path as what her mom went through when she was a child, just for her to go through the same exact thing with her daughter. I'm currently going through the same situation; you feel so defeated when you tried all you could to change that lifestyle to end up repeating it unintentionally.
Sometimes in order to heal, we have to speak our truth. Don't ever let anyone shame you, talk down on you, or abuse you for doing so! Telling your truth after all you've gone through, is super brave. Your daughter is going to grow up so strong and smart like her mother. When you get into a new relationship, I know that you will take what you've experienced in life and quickly choose a right from wrong situation because Souline will be all that matters. So I truly believe that your next relationship will be 1000000x better for you (and your daughter). I can tell that you will go far in life. You'll forever have a better mindset and be way more determined to do what's best for yourself having gone through so much. Healing from trauma early on in life, helps you grow so much as a person. So the fact that you're healing from it, just know that it's only up from here! Thoughts, prayers, and hugs to you Shyla! You have so many people rooting for you!
I remember when Catherine said she started dressing down and not doing her hair and wearing average clothes so they can relate more to the average woman and mom role- it should never be like that. She used to dress up a lot , not worth views . Being confident as a woman and dressing up shouldn’t be a reason for woman to hack other woman or judge. This is why I like you shyla, never shrink yourself
We are all here for you Shyla🥺❤️ You are an incredibly strong women! You were able to escape, and now you can be happy! God is with you every step of the way!
Keep doing you boo. You are a strong Women. Remember haters are gonna hate. You have my support 100%. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So happy for you... you're inspiring so many people, please keep going
18? N fresh out of college?  How.
Love how strong you came back! girl you got this🧡
Good triumphs evil xxxx ps you remind me on my life how you soft you  talk
So I always liked shyla but I never really binged watched their videos or consistently watch them because I just got weird feelings but I think that was just because of landon. I think shyla is so satisfying to watch I enjoy listening to what she has to say now that she’s alone without landon. But loved this video !!❤️🙏🏻
❤️❤️ you deserve the very best!!
I hope you become 100x more successful and more fulfilled in your life than their little cult of a family
Ok, drop part 2 girl… we need it in our life 👏🏼🤣
Wow.. Shyla you’re truly a Wonder Woman ♥️

Shylaaa 😍😍😍 the happiness I got from watching you overcome this. The happiness I got from even seeing your video notification. I’m so extremely happy to see you conquer ❤️‍🔥
🙄
🙄
I used to watch your old videos with you and your ex, and I just slowly stopped watching, something just wasn’t right. When I saw the video you had posted on your own, I was shocked you posted and I was in tears when I saw what he had done to you. You look so much happier, you’re such an amazing mom. I’m excited to see where you go from here💗
How do you believe your own b.s.   You are almost funny
Go Shyla❤so proud of you.
It's your youtube channel Shyla they can either support your channel or go support someone else and don't watch your videos!!! Don't let comments or someone like a stranger tell you what to do or how to look it's your life don't change for nobody be yourself and stay true to yourself!!!
🤍🤍🤍🤍 you’re one amazing woman
So proud of you Shyla 🙌🏻 WHO RUNS THE WORLD? GIRLS 💖💁🏻‍♀️
I'm so sorry you went through that, I truly hope you find peace and love!
I thought you didn't want soline to be on the video !??!?!?!? Oh wait you dont want landon to make money of her but you do ....
😛😛😛😘😘🥰
🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Thanks for sharing can't wait to see what's next for you. You deserve happiness xx
Wow, i loved how natural you sounded this time around. Good for you for taking charge of your life again and being a boss woman! 🙌🏼 good luck on your brand and i’m happy things are looking good for you shyla ✨🙌🏼💕
Shyla is a master manipulator that’s sure
Iam soo happy for you shyla❤️you are soo beautiful and strong women ☺️❤️best of luck on everything you do☺️☺️☺️☺️
you're going to bigger than what you could have ever imagined. keep going. be proud.
Respect ✊🏻
I’m routing sooooooo bad for you! 🥲I can definitely see your maturity & growth. There’s always a rainbow at the end of the rain. 🌈
I cried all through I related more on how she said about her dad
I am so proud of you.
what they THINK not what they KNOW keep doin u love
people try so hard to think they know what’s going on but everything is all just an opinion
I remember when the bullying started, I would always defend you and getting attacked, because they were all fans and were so blind to see… when you have been in a toxic relationship, you know that others are in one even if the world can’t see it. You see it in a womens eyes, the glow has darkened and you can see the pain in their soul even though it’s invisible… Before his cancer, I could see the pain you’d go through I could see how unhappy you were and no one knew anything, but because you have such a big heart you stayed… Gods plans are different from ours but he always brings light after the thunderstorm we have gone through…
I'm super happy for her and that she got out before it was too late. The fact she didn't realize what parenting is until after she left him is extremely sad and eye opening. Cooking 3 times a day, working,  cleaning, all the extra stuff that comes with a child with no help IS what parenting is. That's what everyday parents do.  It's normal for most. There's also people who don't even have family help like she does. It's hard but it's the job. I'm glad she is learning that and she clearly wants to love and protect her child more than anything. I have a feeling this was the wake up call she needed to become the good parent that she is. I have a feeling she is going to rise and shine now. Her daughter is lucky to have her.  I hope she gets full custody honestly. I'm a little confused to why she was talking about how she was so bullied on YouTube and everything then put in clips of people who were talking good about her and just sharing the news of them. I mean that's what happens when you chose that life.  Either way good video, great editing. I never thought I'd enjoy watching it honestly.  Way to go. You got this.

Excited for part 2! You go girl ❤️❤️❤️
I'm in tears, you are so inspiring. You are incredible! You should be beyond proud of yourself❤
Love seeing you shine in this new light! There will always be haters in the world but the good always outweighs the bad. And good things are coming I can tell 💗 I’m seriously blown away by this new version of you and I’m loving it!
I just became a single mom .. thank u for making this . U are inspiring millions 💜
Hey girl, it’s so good to see you and to know that your ok! It’s been awhile. Your strength is contagious. Keep going s strong 💪🏽💪🏽💕💕Missed the baby and your mom too! Love y’all
Anyone who dealt with any type of abuse knows exactly what Shula feels 😣🙏 such a strong woman
She lying she just wants attention
So refreshing seeing this side of Shyla. Thank you for sharing your story with everyone. It’s unfortunate that a lot of the time our first love will always end up being toxic . But so dope seeing you grow because it shows other girls that no matter what you can get through it all .
Shyla please don’t make us wait too long for chapter 2 LOL Proud of you girl! 🙌🏼👏🏼
🙄
Love you shyla 🎀
Wow wat a video ...
That pain of them taking your daughter… I’ve been through it. I’ve felt that pain. That is the worst most helpless pain. You literally just want the only thing that matters most to you. Narcissists suck so bad….
You mean to tell me you never did anything wrong… instead of taking responsibility and be accountable for your actions you come on here to blame other people. That’s a narcissistic trait. JS
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love youuuu!!❤️
Wow, I am speechless bc your just amazing. To be honest I really had no clue who you were until your relationship downfall was all over the internet.  I knew in the last video you put out, I think it was the one where you spoke about your ex and his family, that there was something about your that was truly genuine and so relatable.  That vibe wasn't portrayed in the couple channel you had but now I see its bc you were so torn apart that you felt you had to mold yourself into what everyone else wanted.   After watching this I see you truly don't care what no one thinks but they will respect you was the vibe I got and I'm hooked!!!  Thank you for this because you are a strong, independent,  beautiful, hard working single mom who can come out and speak about life,  not that fake life that other people portray, but real life and it looks damn good on you.  Your glow is unreal and the happiness that is shining thru is so visible and I'm glad that you didn't give up and let them win!!!!!  Lastly, I know you are a busy lady but I hope you have nothing but success and happiness bc you deserve it all!!!!!  Can't wait for episode 2!!!!
I’ve literally always loved you since the very first time I seen you on YouTube . You’re brave, you’re strong & beautiful! I will be praying for you. ♥️✨🙏🏼
Honestly idk how she can fool everyone yall really blind this video just felt wrong like a chance to build a brand out of her problems and im not here for it yall can be but not me she still looks the same as before and she doesn't  give me good person vibes I'm just being honest
YOU'LL get their Chic x
❤️❤️❤️
Sorry for everything you been through Shyla but glad your still going strong! Can't wait to support your brand! 🥰
*OMG GIRL I've never heard you speak the way you have, your hole demeanor is on fire, you seem so much happier & at peace with everything in life*   I just wanna say *WELL DONE YOU SHYLA* your beautiful inside an out ❤️❤️❤️
This is beautiful. May God keep guiding and giving you the strength and May he protect you and your daughter and family 💓💖
WE LOVE YOU SHYLA 🤍🤍🤍🤍
You’re so brave shyla! Not everyone is as brave but with these videos you will give hope to those that can’t.
Shyla. Forget the drama and the hatred. You have a whole life as well as a child to worry about. Don't let words from ignorant people get to you. Our world consists of bullshit from people regardless, but you gotta ignore it and move forward. You can do all you wanna do for yourself and Soul. Be the turn around of your own life, you got this! 💛
Have always loved you in time of l&S you were so real
Had to watch again Shyla your so strong thank you for sharing 😭❤️🔥
Love your transparency💯👌🏾
God will put you through situations for a reason no matter what it will always make you grow even if you don’t want to and make you refocus on what really matters
You go Shyla!!! We are here for you and anything you give us! Thank you for being you! Thank you for being authentic regardless of the circumstances! You are truly someone to look up to! I definitely admire you! We love you! ♥️
New subscriber here., you’re the ultimate inspiration for all female and males who will see this and know there is always a positive solution for anyone who’s in this exact situation and or others., anything is possible🙏, congrats on your new and refreshing life., your daughter is a very lucky little girl🌹
I just hate this drama
Sending you all the love shyla ♥️
i just wanna know what the brand is 😭😭😭😭
Shyla you a strong woman ❤ lots of love ...... May you have a great life ahead
We love you shyyyyy 🤎🤎🤎🤎
Your amazing ! This video was so touching. Your so strong
This was one of the most inspirational YT videos I have seen in a long time! The genuine smile on your face when you talk about your daughter and finally being in a good place… absolutely amazing!
Go queen❤❤❤
You’re such an inspiration 😭🤍 I’m currently going through a very similar situation and it’s been so hard to stay positive but watching you had honestly inspired me to want to share my story and build something for myself and my family.
Your are incredibly strong. And we are here for you! Here for this, here to watch your succeed in life 💕
We love you Shyla ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🙏
Best foundations are built from rock bottom.  You go QUEEN. ✨✨✨
it breaks my heart how she still smiles while talking about him. 💔
“Abusers are just as good as grooming allies as they are at grooming victims”
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 we are SO proud of you!!!
It’s been more than an hour I’m sitting and watching her last video and this one, I feel her and I am proud of her not giving up. ❤️❤️ I hope other women like you will do the same and not give up on their life for men liike these stupid and a**h****
Many blessings for you and your family. We support you. 😘
I’m going throw something so similar to you! I watched my dad and mom growing up and the abuse was terrible. Thought that I would never end up in something like them. Then I met someone who made me exactly like my mothers. Pregnant at 19 with a drug addict who abused me and I got pregnant and had a baby with him. He’s in the Navy and he easily manipulates everyone. I left and now back home with my family and daughter and I’m the happiest I can be but this fight for my daughter isn’t over yet. 🙏🏼
I love this no lie I got teary eye when you said you would watch your daughter sleep and think to yourself I need to give her the best every mom wants the best for the kiddos but sometimes it’s hard
I love youuuuuu so much shyla 💗💗💗💗 I love this new version of you 🥰🥰🥰
Can’t wait for part 2 of your journey Shyla. I’m so so proud of you, for getting out of that abusive relationship WHILE still fighting for yourself and your daughter. I’m so glad to see you working hard and doing YOU! I’ve always been rooting for you girl 💗 you are such a great mom, keep doing you.
The fact she hard working women and life hav make her mature
You are so fine 😮‍💨
Shyla your stronger then you think the first smart move you did was to leave and it's the hardest thing to do when you know you once had so much love for Landon,I'm so proud of you and you deserve the world,keep that beautiful smile your dreams are coming your way,
So happy to see you glowing and striving for success!
Your baby girl is so lucky to have you as a mom💜
You go girl 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽so happy for you and your baby ♥️
LOVE HOW YOU BROUGHT THT GUY INTO THE STORY IT'S THE WAY YOU DID IT, I'M LITERALLY LIKE WHO'S SHE TALIKNG ABOUT! OKAY ACTOR SHYLA IN THE MAKING!!🤩❤
Love you Shyla💖
This also makes you realize that the traumas that we carry as a child can affect us in the future… this is why is so important to heal cuz without knowing we can transmit that to our children and it can affect them in their adult life. We need to learn to not blame anyone for our own traumas.
God bless you and your daughter🤍 rooting for you :))
I’m so excited for you Shyla 💗
I absolutely love this woman and her strength. Shyla you have no idea how many people you’ve touched in abusive relationships and how many people you inspired to turn their pain into strength and passion. I am SO proud of you and you are incredibly Beautiful inside and out. We support you a thousand percent.
Dont worry everything will be okay ❤️
There's a difference between a single mom and a single woman. As long as dad is in baby's life you are just a single woman not a single mom...
I'm so proud of you! I hope you're doing better, you are such a strong woman and a great role model for Souline. Be strong, mama! We're rooting for you
Shyla!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is your rise after the fall. You are a QUEEN. We all love you so much. This video was SO well made. Please keep making content like this!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That just goes to show you never know what someone is truly going through. Honestly the strength you have is crazy to have all these obstacles and still be here is crazy people are evil when it comes to the internet. Haters will never win! Your daughter is gonna see all this one day and be so proud that you’re here and you’re her mother💗 much love to you
Soooo happy for you 🥲!!!!
❤️
We’re always here for you Shyla🥺
That’s so true. You know about your relationship when you have a child. You notice everything and know you deserve better
You are amazing girl you have always been such a strong minded woman so inspiring I love you Shyla keep shining boo and soul Is so adorable miss her ❤️❤️❤️
Shyllaaaa!! Can’t wait to see what the future brings for you
You are amazing and inspiring <3 with you all the way mama!
Do you have new teeth? They Look so Good 😍
Ready for part two!!!
I relate to this so much 🥺 I was in a toxic relationship barely got out it last year still trying to heal
This style of video is bad ass! In 24 hrs more than a half a million of people watched your story! You are winning! I can’t wait to buy whatever you want to sale! Strong women support strong women! This is my second time watching!
More with bashing Landon wtf man I’m disappointed
Im truly happy for you Shyla, you deserve it!
I went through a bad relationship too he would tell me things that would hurt my feelings he would get mad at me for little stuff and when I would clean and make the apartment nice he would invite ppl to do drugs and I would have to clean it up and he would say I never did anything but watch tv and he would say he took care of me and my dog bc I was just in the couch all day mind you I had surgery on my stomach I was cut from hip to hip after recovery I looked for a job I worked at a subway for a year and he would still call me lazy I don't do nothing and when he broke up with me I left and now I'm happy being single I went to Paris and New York 😊
Very inspiring. Women are soooo strong!! I am hoping the best for you and your family
Like I think you both were toxic and abusive in that relationship don’t just blame him
We already saw all those videos about the drama with you and him. This should of been a fresh start and not bring up more oh he was abusive
So excited for you and their series… amazing so far!! Go girl!
Landon literally has been taking you up and you come out with this saying there was more abuse. You didn’t need to add that
I made sure to come into work early so I could tune into this video! you are so strong! from thee previous video I can see the glow, you are shining momma!!!
Shyla!!!!! This is great!!!!!!! YOU ARE GREAT!!!
WE LOVE YOU SHYLA💛
This was so good, the edeting, the talking, EVERYTHING!💗
I love seeing women blossom!
Taking care of our little ones it’s not easy for any mom out there but embracing that you can do it every day that is amazing. Keep doing the best for both of you and be the amazing mom you are 🙌🙏🏼
Shyla you are an absolutely rocking mom! Look at you now! You also look physically healthier and happier xx
I love the new Shyla ❤️ I knew she was strong 💪
May God bless you!
I'm sorry but I feel like you playing the victim, like we know what you went through was difficult, what Landon went through was also difficult, but please move on. Stop bashing him and playing this whole drama over and over again, please just move on. You're literally just destroying your relationship with Landon and Souline at this point, just move on
🙏🏼💓
Wow 😢😢 this really is the beginning Shyla. I can’t wait to see your growth
Pray to god and he will be the only one to help and save you from the dark 🤍🙏🏽
Girl I am so proud of u !! Ur such an inspiration ❤️❤️
Im proud of you i don’t know you personally wish I did, but for me this hits home. You’re daughter will always be grateful for you when she starts to comprehend life as she grows. You keep it up never stop ❤️💯🙏
Stay strong queen we’ve got your back!
Part 2 ASAP❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
I’m so proud of you shyla!!!! I have always liked you and I knew you were gonna do something great, your such a great mom.
Hey shyla!! Lots of love and support to you. I know the possibility of you reading this is negligible but please try and read the book by Colleen hoover- it ends with us. I think then you would understand that “ keep swimming”.
you are so inspiring ! Can’t wait for the rest of this series !
Clout chaser
you dont need no award to let u know u are a super human shyla  YOU ARE A SUPERHUMAN!!! periioodt your a strong independent MAMA!!
Hey shyla..we're here for you..can't wait for chapter 2
Just watching this in awe of your strength! Who’s watching this so proud of Shyla right now?
I don’t get how people can attack one YouTuber for certain things but do not call other YouTubers for doing those exact same things. Double standards and those are the people who need a reality check
Shyla, i am extremely excited for this new chapter you are about to have… I wish you the best & i am always going to support you🙏🏼🤞🏼🥰 one day i hope i can buy something in Shyla brand, that would be dope af
Watching your videos i can see your an amazing person and mother. So strong
Dude you kept everything to yourself and left him buck ass naked, isn’t all this still not enough for you??
Sooooo happy you managed to swim!!! Loving this and keep it up 💕💕
I love you Shyla  I’m a mother of a baby boy and I knew how you feel  being a single mom  Just knew that god always with you and  You as a mother you have to make sure that giving up is not ok  I love you♥️
Love love love…You got this Shyla!
Keeping shining gorgeous!! You have no idea how impactful your words are. Focus on you and your daughter and you'll both have a bright future. much love!!
You go shyla!!!!!
Yessss Shyla … so happy to see she’s doing so much better without that dead weight . Love to see it ♥️
Wow, I am proud of someone I dont even know! Blessings your way
I’m so excited to see what’s next!!
I think it’s one thing to tell your story but to tell his story is another you wouldn’t be okay with the narrative so why should he be?
Shyla!!!! Babe you are doing the dam thing. You’re  radiating excellence, healing, and growth. I’m glad to see your back with YOUR story to tell. I’m here for it!
so inspirational 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Poor you you don’t have no money to live at a good house but look at you with Hollywood smile
Routing for you and Souline ! 💞 Im a child from a single mom and she did everything she could for us, you got it all you need is Soul 🥺🧿💖
Jealousy makes people hateful ! My little sister is super pretty like Shula and the hate and judging she got and gets from mainly women is so sad I have to remind her sometimes to show her why some act jealous and turn into being mean 😢
We love you Shyla
🤍🤍🤍
Congratulations 🎊🍾 Mama so happy for you.  I knew you’ll get up and be happy again.  🙏🏽❤️ God bless you and your beautiful daughter
You go Shyla ! We love to see a strong independent woman 🤪 genuinely love you & soul 4 ever
You look beautiful and happier then ever I’m so happy I knew you would end up being okay love you
Stay strong mama!
I feel like when two people are in a toxic relationship it brings the bad out in both people, so it shouldn't be one person was wrong or right. I don't think its fair for either of them to blame the other person. BOTH had a role in something. I support both people ❤
I loveeee this shyla!!!! You’re so strong I admire you🤍🤍 keep being you🥰
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for sharing your story ❤
I get what you went through and all if the courts didn't keep it going through the process then the story wasn't straight and you should move forward in life if you keep dwelling on your past then you will be stuck in the situation you were in please keep your head up and keep moving forward in life and remember what you say can also be a reflection of your self still no shade or hate thrown your way he has not thrown any shade your way nor has he spoken about you so let's keep this  💯 honest
I’m so happy for you Shyla, thank you for showing your strength and know that you’ll be ok in the end ❤️
Wow, Shyla!!! I’m literally one minute in & this is truly one of the best intros to a video I’ve ever seen! The editing is so freakin fire 🔥 anyway, can’t wait to see the rest of the video! Much love 💛
You're so strong so beautiful we are here for you!!!!We Love You ❤
Love this new video, I hope you are fully healed.
I need to get on the YouTube I keep saying Iam but never post this kinda motivates to post something ❤️❤️🦋✨✨ team S
Stop… deleting… your… videos..
I cried watching this. I am so proud of you. You seriously inspire me so much! ❤️
sending you love xx
“I was capable of going without something” -Shyla  So powerful
Rooting for you girl!!!!!!
Wow, always had watched L&S, never really paid attention or known how BEAUTIFUL her voice really is.
We love you Shyla❤️
Were here proud of you ❤
You’re just fucking ignoring all that REAL shit Landon talked about his video. How can someone be this FAKE get some help pls ! This is crazy . I feel so bad for your kid .
Thank you for this. You have more people behind you than you think. Blessings are coming your way Shyla🤍✨🧿
Keep your head up Shyla! You have so many people in your corner! Ignore the few negative comments you may get. Your amazing woman and mother! Can’t wait for part 2! We all love you!
I am so proud of you 🥺❤️ it’s crazy how connected I feel to you when it comes to relationships and motherhood.. we can do this ❤️
I don’t even feel sorry for this girl after all the lies she said on her last “truth” video . I’m so so sorry but I can’t believe much she says anymore if anything at all . This all sounds to me like a promotion video for her brand 😂
What an inspiring video!! So beautiful. You are strong ❤️
More power to you shyla you rock <3 lots of LOVE XOXO .
Shyla,   I’m so happy seeing you become so independent and strong 💪🏼 I’m glad you’re fending for yourself and your baby girl now. It’s so hard in the beginning but I’m so glad to see you shine.   There’s another level of sparkle in your eyes which you didn’t have when you were with Landon.   I hope you continue to shine through your own efforts and hard work and never become dependent on any man.   Sending you positive vibes and endless love for baby soul 😘
You are so strong and brave for leaving, it is so hard to leave a toxic abyss I’ve relationship. You and your daughter are way better off. Sending you guys the best thoughts and prayers! ❤️
We love you Shyla 🤎
Dramatic asf! I’m on Landon’s side, female need to stop treating their baby daddy’s and other men like shit.
Shyla you’re an amazing mother and from one mama to another I am proud of you for getting out of the abusive relationship you and your daughter have suffered! It’s a dark path you had to navigate through and, I a random stranger am proud of you. I got chills watching your video!! bad ass mommas never get the recognition they deserve and you’re going to do amazing things for you and your girl!
so strong
Real and raw and honest and a survivor. Truely strong and beautiful and inspiring to your daughter and an many other women showing them hope you can get out and hope you can build yourself back up. Power xo
Hi Shyla! Keep making more youtube videos! Im watching all the ads just so u can get that bag 💸
I love watching you! one thing i always say, While us mothers struggle and are going through certain things at the end of the we show up for are kids and make sure they are good! while dads in this generation think being a parent is optional 😤 shout out to us ! 💕
I’m here for this … let’s see her win !!!
I just know Landon is gonna find something to wrong with this video and he’s gonna find the need to defend himself cause he knows what he did. We can see right through him and his entire family. We are here for you and we are here to stay ❤️
god gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. go you 💗
you’re so inspiring shyla. we are all here rooting for you. you’re truly an inspiration to single mothers out there, just to be able to tell your story the way you just did is touching. can’t wait to support your brand!!! on a side not shout out to the chisme report!!!
Awww❤️‍🩹💔
Any fellow chismosas here get sooo excited when they saw Danny
Get a real job
I know Landon bout to go post a video... He proli brainstorming right now😂
You are so strong and it's only going to get better.
👏👏👏
Shyla as a person who's been through a similar situation you're inspiring keep telling your story.  We're all behind you! YOU LOOK AMAZING BEAUTIFUL
You go girl!!! Such an inspiration ✨you are so loved✨❤️
Been in this exact situation minus the YouTube and I’m still harassed by my ex and his family constantly. You have given me so much hope and I wish you and your daughter nothing but happiness 💕
God bless you Beautiful God Jesus Christ is with you always 🙏🏻🙌🏻 Glory be to God ❤️
We’re happy to have you back Shyla 💗  ✨ go little rockstar ✨
you go Shyla!!!!! you look so beautiful...keep chasing your dreams and don't let anyone take that away from you!
Who remembers the episode in The Hills where Lauren has an opportunity to go to Fashion Week in Paris and she doesn't go because of the guy. Her boss never let her forget it. In this situation... everything happens for a reason. She walked away before things got even more worse and came up on top.
I can relate. Shyla I made it alone with three kids, and two of them passed away in less than two months. They were gone forever. I retired at 40 from the Army. Just like that, I found myself being the strongest person ever. Continue to be the best because you deserve it. All my son wanted before he died was for me to get my Bachelor's because he used to say, "You have all my beautiful mommy." I'm about to get my MBA in business management. My major is HR, because it was my job in the Army and I will be proud no matter where they are both physically, but they are here in my heart every day. You can do it. I cried with these and I admired you. Stay strong, beautiful angel! You and your beautiful baby deserve the whole world!!!
Look at that smile !! I’m here for it baby ! My heart just feels so happy to see you happy !
🙏🏻♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Ok Queen ✨✨💗💗
You're the best Shyla 💖 I love you
I’m rooting for you Shyla!!!
Hey, I think her face changed. Did she do a nose job or any other surgery recently ? She was prettier before 🙂
Shyla! THANK YOU for sharing your story. If you’ve ever questioned or felt hesitant in sharing your story, please take it as a confirmation that you’re doing the right thing. I say that because of how much your story is helping thousands of women who have been in similar shoes. You are such an inspiration. You have inspired me to keep chasing my passions, my dreams and to do it for myself and my future children. I wish I could thank you in person tenfold. Thank you. I cannot wait to see where this journey takes you 🤍
Business Queen Mama Shyla🤍😍🥰so happy for you and praying for success, love and peace!🤍

I’m actually wanting to write a book about everything I went through just because everyone that knows my story and sees where I’m at now all day… please write a book you’ll be so glad you did when your older.. anything to help others see how bad it is and how good it can be! Love this version of you!

This is so inspiring wow women are so powerful
I felt that some thing was wrong when she was with her Ex, coz when he came back from the Hospital the cancer he did not go to his daughter any parent would do that first ... it felt he was acting for the cam thats all ... I hate such guys....
I’ve felt genuinely connected to you the moment I found out about you. You have such a sweet and soft soul that I can feel. I love your channel because it’s raw and honest. I’m extremely proud of you!
This was beautiful. Thank you for sharing Who you truly are. As someone who went through abuse for years as well this touches my heart  I’m so happy for you ♥️

I think this will be my new favorite channel. Thank you for sharing your story with us and for staying tuned!  love from germany <3
Where can we buy your brand ?😍
Thank you for sharing your story 🙏🥰 it’s a long healing process. However shyla you got this you have a world of woman that stand next to you. I’m one of them🙏🙏🙏🙏 God bless you and your daughter
Just know that we support you and YOU DESERVE THE BEST!!❤️❤️❤️
You are an amazing woman and will be a great role model for your daughter, especially when she is older and sees how hard her mummy has worked.
This goes to all the ppl that criticized her …. Next time shut up because u don’t know what they are going thru… 🙄🙄
Girl we love and support but u got me ready  to grab my wallet cause anything with your name on it I will support
It’s never easy to share your story, I applaud you girl! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  People on Twitter were trying to say everyone “you’re only believing Shyla because she’s a woman” but no. You can genuinely see the difference in how she and Landon both responded/reacted.  When the other person is defensive, trying to switch the narrative, and negatively calling out the other person— they’re usually the one hiding something. 🤷🏽‍♀️
I smell something fishy, sorry
I think so many people have been through similar situation to you, so you speaking up gives them the courage to also speak up. Also the hate you were receiving was terrible.
Shyla… Shyla….SHYLA… 🦋  I am sooo soooo dam proud of you! Your energy, aesthetic, and drive is leading you to success. This is what “I’m putting shit to bed and making it happen” looks like. Life is short but doesn’t mean your dreams should be small. Thank you for sharing these moments with us. I’m so excited for you and I felt nothing but a “YASSSSS” after watching this video.   Wow. You make me even more proud to be a woman, and I will be even more proud to be a mother when that time comes for me. ✨  Souline has a bad ass mom.
💕💕
Girl you are soo strong. The fact that you were able to open up and talk about your story and everything you went through is such a big thing. 💗 always supporting you 😚
💓
💝💝💝💝
You’re glowing and look so happy now. I’m so happy for you 💕
So inspiring ❤️ so relatable for me  ❤️

Narcissistic is written all over him 🙄 I’m glad you’re in a better place now!! Good for you!

Landon, who!??   Girl, you've grown soo much! Wow

Fucking queen👸🏽
Loved this so much so amazing to see you back ❤️ can’t wait for part 2 and condolences
People will always try to dim your light but you only grow brighter in the end. Sending love and strength to you Soul💞
Its so nice seeing you breaking thought and becoming thé best version of you ❤️
Im sorry but Bruh you’re all cap! I see right through you....I’m not even on Landons side. I’m just saying what it is and you try to manipulate and lie making him look like the bad guy when there’s proof how you really are behind cameras🤷🏽‍♂️ Your own mom and dad know how you’re and that’s why they were backing Landon up for everything. The thing is that people like you can never accept that they are the problem and it’s sad. Like I said though....I’m just saying what it is! All love here💯🙏
Trying to bring Landon down won't make you successful in life. Move on put the past behind you let all this drama you brought with your break up with Landon go. Move on you will find a brighter day stop all this bitterness.
Here for you babes💖
Can’t wait too see more of you!
Shyla im so glad you found your strength your such a beautiful person i cant wait to watch your journey unfold.  Praying for you and your family 💜
And here is Shyla building her own YouTube Channel on the costs of the ace family and Landon.
Never felt like I related more to someone emotionally and physically I feel like we when thur exactly the same thing! 🥺💕
I’m so incredibly happy for you Shyla you have no idea. Your strength is so inspiring! It’s only up from here! Continue to be the best you 🤎
This is all CAP 🧢.. you guys need to go to landons page so u can watch his video to reference all this bs Shyla is talking about! Landon recorded everything and has all receipts
I'm glad you are healing, and you look so much put together, sending you all the love, take care love
I love shyla and I stand with shyla always ❤️
I love you ❤
I believe every word she says, because i saw my sister go through the same exact thing. She had to be put in the trunk of a car pregnant, to be saved from being killed, from the father of her daughter. Her words her my heart, because my sister loved that man so much, she could not see her self without him, but once she got out and went through the pain of everything being over, then she had to start healing from all she went through with that man. Till this day 21 years later, she is still dealing with that trauma, but won't talk about it at all. She never spoke negatively about him to mi niece, she has always been just like shyla, very much with her head held high, just saying some things, but not with anger or hate. I respect this young lady so much, because she is soeaking her truth, without trying to humiliate him, when he deserve to be, in my opinion, any abuser deserve to be. I believe her, i dont doubt not one word that is coming out of her mouth, i hope she is able to heal and find someone that will treat her with the respect she deserves.
Sending you lot’s of love Shyla. Thank you for sharing this💙
You are literally a rock a inspiration. 🤍
Shyla you are such an amazing person and mother I got so emotional when you expressed how you woke up in your friends son's room and turned over to see your beautiful baby girl and knew that you had to do something because that beautiful blessing of yours deserved to have the best life..... as a mother myself I know that feeling all to well. Just know that when times get tough  its just the devil trying to keep you from receiving the blessings that God has in store for you and soul Just close your eyes and say God let no weapon formed against me prosper or succeed.... and continue to push through.  Know that you are beautiful and blessed beyond measure let noone take that away from you❤💖💝❤ sending you both lots of love and blessings!
Proud of you Shyla ❤️
This is one of the best YouTube Videos I have ever watched! That’s amazing girlie and one from single Mumma to another , YOU’VE GOT THIS GURLLLLLL XOXOXOO
This is a movie, can’t wait for part 2😍
Using trauma to advertise. Basic mainstream influencer behavior.
You got this Shyla continue to focus on yourself and daughter, and your brand , and continue healing🤎🙏🏾
Keep your head up queen , so your crown does not fall, we love you ♥️
Sorry for what you went through. But how much did both of you contribute . To the fights . I just hear he said she said . So no one really gonna give the truth.
Love this❤️ part 2 please
So proud of you shyla!
U know when u said u had no car and that loser was driving ur car around really made me sick. Love really does turn to hate
You are strong and their are alot of people who can relate to you and support you , you are a great mum and have a purpose in life for your daughter
Bloody inspiring . You’ve inspired many women and thank you for sharing your story ❤️
here for you 🤍
It’s great to see you healing. Hope you get everything you wanted cuz you deserve it. Sending you lots of love💙💚
Just like many other people i can relate in so many ways, didn’t expect to cry but i really was inspired. Proud of you💟
You are beautiful. I am so excited for your brand
You know he is dirt - she can’t even say his name once in the video
Congratulations 🎊🎈🍾 Keep your head up!!!
*Bravo to tell your life story after all the backlash you reveive(d). Random question; How come you did not stay at your mom? (Or siblings) or even rent a place temporary with all the money you (claim) have? You are luckily still in an advantage position to start a Brand because you already have followers Plus capital made out of YT* So YT did make it able for you to be here today still, so don’t regret it all!
Omg when u said how did u end up on the same situation as your mother and father trying your hardest not to end up like that I felt that sooo much just had a baby and I always told myself I would have a great man and father for my kid Bc my mother did not and ... sadly I see my situation becoming more of my mothers 😭💔so happy u got out and did whats right for you and soul sending love 🤍
You go girl! 💕 Best wishes to you!
Ur just a diamond  we all love you a goal 💕
She Bossed Up! 😎
I love this ! I’m so proud of you Shyla💗
❤️❤️👏👏
You go girl!
The difference between the you in those old videos with Landon and you now, with Landon you were a girl but you sweet baby gave you the stepping stones to be an amazing woman now and give you the strength you neeeded. I just go out of a similar relationship. 8 years of me trying, 8 years of being verbally and physically ab*sed. We then had our son and my son seriously has saved my life and made me open my eyes.  Your amazing Shyla ❤️
Shyla your energy seems so much more happy I love to see it 🥺❣️💞
Girl you are rocking this sh*t   , I’m proud I’m inspired . Love love you 🥰
I just know the people who do support you are all here for you!!!! Keep staying strong because you are not just staying strong for yourself, you are staying strong for all the people who's been through these things!!!!!!!
Thank you. U're story sounds very similar to my journey so far. And inspired me so much. Sending ALL LOVE❤️&& Gratitude🙏☮️
❤️
Her energy is sm better, and I'm here for it !!!❤❤❤
Why are so many people commenting but not following? I love your story Shyla!!! Keep more content coming I know you will make it

444th subscriber 💟
YOUR AMAZING 💗💗💗
I hope shyla knows that no matter what, you never have to go back to that, yes you will always be tied to him but you came out if it. You fought so hard & you are gonna make it!!!
Just be you. I've been through hell and back a few times. I would just advise to always be yourself , be honest do you. When your not it shows. If your not happy get out which you did. It gets way worse in abusive relationships. Good thing you dnt go through anything too bad.  You could see.... you both were angry frustrated and insecure with each other.  You guys just weren't good for each other.
You are such a beautiful and such a strong woman I just want  you to know that
❤️❤️❤️❤️
LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU QUEEN 💗💗💗😍
Lots of love from India ...you great woman👩.. Stay bless always❤
Nothing but upward from here!!! ❤️ we are here for you
You are such an inspiration. Can't wait to see what you have in store.
Shyla you're such na inspiration,Really sorry for judging you before. But now I realised,im myself going through such a hard time don't have anyone to talk to about it. Thank you so much for putting out your story you're an inspiration to many ,keep going 👏
Im so proud of the women and mother you have become 💓 I love you ❤
i love this and you❤️
This was badass 😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️
You are the light in the room. Shine baby girl SHINE
I’ll never forget how awful the internet has been to Shyla, especially in the hardest moments of her life!! WE LOVE YOU!!!
love you shyla
Yay, Shyla is back! 💕💕
Love you keep your head up 🥺🥺🥺💕
Happy for you❤
Not Landon trying to use this opportunity for clickbait 🤦🏻‍♀️
shylaaaa you are getting beatiful every day ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️
💕💕💕💕💕
Bro wtff why can’t you fucking drop it like it just keeps going like move on and keep pushing forward why keep talking about it or recording yourself like wtffff
🤍🤍🤍🧿🧿🧿
An absolute super women !!! My inspiration in every way, I can’t explain how incredible you are Shyla!!!! 🥺🥺❤️
Wow 😭  Sending so much love to you 💖
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Glad you let that bum go
Look how shylas story is much more relatable and touching than Catherine's cosmetic brand starting story was.
This is so beautiful, Shyla. Healing looks pretty on you. 🤍✨
Bro and Shyla sometimes you need to see that there is the world that men get abuse so you can’t just like be doing that like you have no evidence you weren’t there putting your daughter to sleep to take it out for walk like be honest
The editing… chefs kiss 👌🏼
YOU ARE A STRONG WOMAN KEEP GOING
And swearing at anyone that is over your age even older than you that is disrespectful and disgusting because they’re older than you you should be respecting the elders so get it right you rude girl or should I say woman I G
How about try and tell the truth because you’re a really disrespectful person in general you are definitely the most hideous person I ever seen in my life swearing at someone’s mother is not good it’s disrespectful
I find the Ace Family so annoying, I always wrote Shyla off as apart of them. Today I realize she is a strong woman, who deserves respect on her name for the things she’s been through and still getting up every day for her daughter. 💁🏻‍♀️❤️
You're really inspiring. We love you shyla and we're here for you 💓💓
I never watched the channel you used to upload to with your ex, but I can tell from listening to your story that you must’ve been so incredibly caught up in him and how he treated you. I’m tearing up writing this because I know so many friends who have been in abusive relationships, some have made it out and some are still stuck. All I can say is I admire your strength, courage and willpower to keep going, to stay strong for your daughter and for yourself. Men like him have to be held accountable and I know that’s a driving force for a lot of women,  but it’s equally as important to simply detach and start to live your life for yourself. That’s the best revenge I think. You’re and incredible woman, I am so in awe and I know you’re setting a great example for your daughter. Thank you for speaking up and for telling your story. Sending you all of my love today, all the way from Sweden ❤️
Hey Shyla! I really loved this video and that you shared part of your life♥️ but I was kinda waiting if you’d add how God helped you with your struggles (well if you believe He did idk thought that would be interesting to hear in your stories)
Throughout the L&S journey I disliked you...maybe it was because of your energy. It was negative and I now realise that it was because you were so unhappy.  Today I saw this video & only got positive vibes because finally...FINALLY you are at a much better place and probably happy.  Subscribed 💌
You were honestly a bubbly person and as you got more into YouTube you forgot about that Shyla… now that you left that toxic situation, you’re back to that shyla
With how much love she’s talking about Landon at the beginning. She really loved him it’s sad
You're going up from now on Shyla 😘😁
Nose contour too much. Still beautiful
❤️❤️❤️❤️

Congratulations on your new life Shyla!!!! You deserve the best babe, coming out of a toxic NARCISSTIC RELATIONSHIP is very hard, but you goin gin the right direction gurl. He's an asshole, narcissist, always wondered why you were with a JOKER like Landon when you could be doing so much better. Perhaps, this all started after you didn't take that job offer to London and stayed with him. Just imagine, where you'd be professionally. For all girls out there, always prioritize yourself, take that education, take that job, think about yourself, cause men come and go, but you be there for yourself always!!!!!!!   Lots of Love <3
😍
This hurt me to the core, me as a mother to a two year old baby girl I could just imagine what you’ve gone through. What hurts the most is being a mother to a perfect baby, going through all of this with a narcissist.
Looking forward for more videos

Your free and that’s a good feeling. Feeling free and at peace.
Yayyy Shylaaaa is back
You're so right, I've found myself becoming a bit protective of you after reading some awful comments in the past, and anytime I would write a comment to speak up for you, I would get slammed with tons of awful comments myself, that type of environment can literally make or break someone, so happy to see that your not letting the BS keep you down 😉 You made the channel what it was, so you'll do just fine on your own, I know it....
Being an influencer it’s a lot of stress and it’s not for everybody because the people in the world are so nasty that they always feels do they have a right to comment on someone’s life it broke her she went from being happy and bubbly to just being mean and then you guys judged her for being mean😐🥺
You're such an inspiration. Lot's of love to you & Soul. 🦋
Landon  Got a hold of the money and money is evil I’m telling y’all it makes people do things that you would never think they would ever do it’s not just money it’s some thing about the ace family in general🥺
I love you & your daughter 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This should be trending!!
I’m crying like a baby. 😭
Unfortunately we end up falling for toxic people because we don’t know what the red flags actually look like. It’s absolutely crucial to heal your wounds, work on yourself, make yourself a priority, educate yourself on toxic personality types, narcissism, abusive behaviours, KNOWLEDGE IS POWER
Girl. You weren’t even abused. Theres people in worse situations then you. This is all for clout and money. Cry baby
Love you Shyla!!!❤️❤️
You titled this living my nightmare but I think you should’ve titled this Living my truth 😇 🙏
You are stronger than you will ever know. Keeping you and your family in my prayers 🙏🏼❤️
Your Beautiful, Your Strong!  People are gonna talk weather your doing good, weather your doing bad. So we gotta let them talk . Sending Love and Prayers to your beautiful babygirl and You. ❣️
aww bebes i’m so proud of you, you are so strong and i’m so sorry you had to go through all of that, keep ur head up mamas!
We love you shyla idc what anyone says

You give so much positivity even though you were in the worst situation ever...... Thank you for giving so much energy....... I love you sooo soooo much Shyla..... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love her ❤
Glad to see you on top. Keep going no matter what. Just like you said bc of your daughter. Being a single mom and doing everything and anything just to survive it ain't easy. But you got this sweetie. Your a great mom just remember that. Superwoman ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Her voice is so nice to listen to, like I can literally gts to it 😭🤍🤍
seeing how easily he left her without a home without a car, without money, shows the type of person he truly  is no matter what happens in a relationship she is the mother of your child she should have a good home a mansion like he does or at least a decent home  because it’ll be ur daughters home too,  a good person wouldn’t leave the mother of his child basically on the street. Or at least he could of offered to help her out while she got a job or something what an ass! He should be paying child support!
QUEEN 👸🏻
You go ms.girl 💞💞💞
I’m so happy for you Shyla
I love shyla, you can tell she’s genuine. She’s so strong, keep pushing girl ❤️
All I gotta say is Queen I never doubted you coming back 10x better, stronger! You are an empowering woman!! Don’t ever doubt that! Exciteddd for pt 2!!
You are so strong. I admire your courage. You’re amazing 🥲

Everything happened for reasons look at you NOW more different than before I can see how confident and dependent you are now I am so proud of you keep shine ✨ and keep going up
God will take you through hell just to get you to heaven 🎈🎈
Never dealt something so real
God is with you girl read the bible Evry day the lord will show you the way peace of mind and happiness have faith on him He will lift you up .. be bless you n Souline.
You were never crazy you were only trying to protect your daughter and any mother would understand. You had a tough childhood and weren’t able to see the wrong in your relationship.
Not Shyla thinking she’s Kylie Jenner with this documentary style video 🤣
I love this, I love how your opening up to us on how and why you became who you’ve become, tho you don’t owe anyone an explanation, speaking on it is healthy and helps ❤️☺️ the good and the bad, it’s really helped me, boost me on opening up as well. thank you💕💯
Rise up shyla 🙏
Shyla 🤎 Oh Man She Came Stronger 😍🥰🤎 And Better 🥰
You are on top of the world Shyla we love you so much
When i saw the videos of her and landon i started sobbing 😭😭😭😭😭😭 i miss yall together but i know its for the best 😏 i hope you are happy now though shyla ur shinning ❤️‍🩹
This is good your doing good you look good 💯keep going
Joe who? That editing was fire and I’m so proud of you. You’re going far!
congrats on building up the courage to leave a taxi relationship
Proud of you .u doing a good job .💖
I never liked your Ex nor his brother. both sc6mbags
Very very strong super proud of you! ❤️❤️
God is good,god is great 🙏🏼ily queen 💕
Best thing is to now focus on ur present and future. Let go of the past which makes you vulnerable. Be strong 💪
Shyla is so strong & truly independent
So much strength. 🦋
A lot of people don’t talk about this & hearing you say how you fought to not be in the same situation as your mom shook me. It’s so true. We all fight to not be in that same position as they were but sometimes we still end up in that same spot. It’s hard to even recognize that we’re in it and then having to take that step to get out and face another hurdle of having to start at zero all over again. Not only as an individual but with a child, another human being that depends on you and strength and love. I’ve been following up with you for a while now and honestly I’m so proud of you and I’ll be rooting for you and supporting you. You’ve been inspiring to me as I’m sure to others as well.
We love uuuu❤️❤️
I want to send you so so so much love Shyla I'm in chills and tears for you I hope nothing but the very very very best for you💞💞💞
Go Shyla!  You got this! Protect you AND your little one from any harm, no matter what!
YES!!!! THIS is the Shyla we've been waiting for!!! ❤❤❤❤

#strongwoman
That’s crazy…. But shayla is gonna be an amazing mom. Best thing your daughter needs is a phenomenal role model. Keep grinding and stay positive everyday.
this right here is so powerful, thank you for sharing !! 💌
I’m super happy for your brand & how as a strong woman your brand keeps evolving ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾 Super excited for you Shyla & the role you play in Sol’s life and teaching her to be so powerful that or those who try to bring her down  men will be so scared due to rising above trauma, performing above success & living life through humility, grace & confidence Excited to see the next chapter & happy new year from Carbondale Illinois
Her and Landon are professional liars and victim players. They were both in the game together and did not get along on the long run. She has more support than Landon because Landon is tarnished already by association to the ace family drama. She talks about this brand as if it is Fentyxsavage lmao. It will be a trash normal youtuber merch like all of them
Is it me or she looks like Rita oras twin
We here for you Shyla!
I got out of a 8 year abusive relationship about  8 months ago. He was mentally physically and emotionally abusive. Him being a narcists didn't help. I wasn't allowed to speak with my family, ( they thought that he killed me and dumped me some where. I could not get a drivers license or have a phone. Finally i got the courage to leave him one night when i was hanging out with my bestie. I just never went home. He called my work tried getting me fired. Stole money out of my bank account and attempted to turn our friends against me. I met him when i was 18. I am now 26 I just got my license last Monday. I have a phone a job ( which I wasn't allowed to have either)  and a amazing support system! You are strong and this situation will make you even stronger!!! You are a super woman and an amazing mother!
I'm so happy to be seeing your new journey. I wish you and your babygirl the best.  I hope you both stay healthy. Im rooting for you Shyla💗 I've always been rooting for you
THIS WAS SOO GOODDDD
What's your brand??? I'm so confused lol
wow amazing video i am so proud of you Shyla thank you for sharing your voice what you have truly gone through not faking everything like nothing happened. A woman can become successful on their own, you don’t need a man to find your purpose what you really need is a healthy life and God your number one! what your mom said was so true i will keep that quote for me! can’t wait to see the next video🙌🏼
We all are here for you and soul

I love u Shayla ur so beautiful and strong keep pushing for soul❤️❤️f the bs they think it's cute what they are doing but soul will see who who's pure and who's not coming from someone who's dad did some many things to try and get me to hate my mom and me and my mom are closer then ever❣️❣️❣️
The story was all over the place u talked about one thing then u talked about another topic... U and ur daughter's father broke up months ago. Let it go. We're now in 2022.🤦🏻‍♀️

You are strong love and you get threw everything ♥️♥️♥️

Shyla don't u know SLOAN DRAGGED You threw the mud when you did a review for 12:12 gateway. Sloan is not your friend.
Go girl ❤️
Wow ….. quality quality quality content 👌🏾
I’m so happy for you that your out of that toxic bullshit we all know as the ace family , your so much better , you are authentic , relatable , honest , share your real struggles like having no vehicle and putting your stuff in garbage bags,you tell your viewers what’s up instead of lying about everything (even when it’s public records like some people do 😂) you are just so much more respectable and a role model for young woman .. or to be honest anyone who’s been in an abusive relationship and came out shining . I just know your gonna shine ✨Good for you Shyla ! You deserve it 💜💓

Sis love you
Proud of you Shyla 👍🏼 Oh by the way,, you remind me of Rita Ora 😁
This was too good ypu truly just wow 👌 👏 😍 👍 🥰 ☺️  im watching for a second time.
You seem like such a beautiful soul. You didn’t have to come back to YouTube to explain anything. Congratulations on starting your band and being able to heal! ♥️
Girl is GLOWING!!! This is your time to shine!
YOU GO GIRL!!! can't wait for part 2 and to hopefully buy your merchandise! 🙏💜🤞💫
Yes you are healing.   Continue and know things will get better.  ❤️
I knew from the get go it wasn’t you and it was Landon. The McBrooms need therapy for their narcissism.
I’m so glad you still have Pickles and Stax. please show them!
Go girl ❤️❤️ You got this!
I like you so much more NOW! You are a completely different person who clearly is not hurting anymore. You hid it so well, but not really. We could all tell for a good while. You’re a rockstar, Shyla. KEEP GOING! 💪🏼😃🤸🏻‍♀️😘
I am so proud of you. You have become so far and deserve the best. Thank you for sharing your story because I am sure you are helping others. God bless you always 🙏🏻❤️
I found you because of the things happening with your family you seem like such a sweet soul and I pray that you continue to heal and grow and just win❤️❤️❤️
I like you a lot, Shyla! 😃
Let's not forget how his mom had involvement in this whole thing too. Conspiring with her son to take Shyla's money. What a low, dirty, bum move. No one should be supporting that family any longer. Scammers. Things started falling into place for you once the evil was removed out of your life. No more isolation from family.  Thank your lucky stars you were able to (for the most part) escape them. You keep going Shyla. You have a lot of support and we are here for you. 💛
Using clips of Sloan and Danny is Lowly .. She's still using clips of Landen to make him look bad. Dear God🥺 Shyla, just like Landen doesn't mention you. I hope you can do the same one day. Be honest your insecurities because of YouTube and all the negative comments also worsened your relationship LS gang could see it all before you even admitted it...  This is so confusing. She gets to put Landon's face all over her YouTube page and Landon can't put his own daughter's face on his YouTube page. They say Landon is using Soul for  views. But they are not saying she's using Landon for views. This is so bias and so sexist. Wow.
My gal🥺❤️ u went thru alot m so proud of u
much love girl keep being strong !!!
19:19 …angel  numbers !!!!means your life is changing forever …soul was born to change you   Crazy look into those numbers
Wish nothing but success for this girl🙏🏽💕
I love you Shyla will always support you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shyla, you have no idea how many other woman are going thru the same struggles. We are here for you 🤍 XO
look how landon and shyla videos are so different🤣
❤️❤️❤️
Soul is going to look back on this video one day and say "that's my mom, she's my hero"💖
Go mommy go mommy ❤️ so inspiring
Shyla, I'm so proud of you and you are an inspiration to me. I too was in a horrible relationship(married to a controlling, manipulative, alcoholic, abusive narcissist for 7 yrs) His family is very wealthy and prominent in this town. My mother passed 3 yrs before we divorced so I was alone thru the process. We had 2 children together and he was successful in taking them away from me while he had an open CPS case against him and there was absolutely no reason for them to be taken from me. I am and was a great mom and lived for my babies . I'm positive they paid off the judge. You're showing me that I can do what needs to be done in order to build my mental health back up. I was stripped of my identity when my kids were taken from me. I've become a shell of who I used to be. Empty inside. Crying myself to sleep every night. Thank you for sharing your story and you're going to do great things for yourself and for your baby girl! ♡
Sending love babe missed you on YouTube xoxo thank you for sharing your story 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Wow. Beautiful. 👏👏👏👏   I am most definitely here for this Amazing channel!
I hope This means new beginnings and positivity for you shyla❤️ my youngest sister and Soul were born same month day same year!
❤️❤️❤️
So proud of you Shyla🤍✨

Love love loveeee this makes me too emotional i Hope god's with you always ❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺🥺
You have come this far and we know that you will be able to face all the negativity from fake people shyla. We love you alot. There is no life without fake people. We grow from all the hate. Stay strong. You have a beautiful girl with you. You are never alone. We love you. You got this definity.😘❤️
we love you sis. your such a strong woman all together. you’ve got this and your going to shine ✨
You are one strong women! Shyla we are all here for you! Love you girl!!
The worst part of it all is that little Soul will carry on with the trauma of what you unfortunately went through while being pregnant and after. All thanks to her very own father. It is true when they say, you truly know a man by the way he treats you while carrying his own child. Not only do you have to work on healing yourself but her as well so she Carries no chains of this trauma for generations to come. Blessings to you both wishing you the best moving forward. I will support your brand and the meaning behind it. Can’t wait for part 2. As well, my deepest condolences to you and your family for the passing of your beautiful sister.
Good luck shyla
The editing zooming out is making me higher
👑🙌
You already know pancho is fighting the air right now because he didn’t make the cut on reporting the chisme 😂😂😂😂😂
i’m so proud of you shyla GO GIRL U DESERVE EVERYYYYY HAPPINESSS souline is the luckiest to have momma like you darling🥺🥺🥺🥺 ✨GO LITTLE ROCKSTAR ✨❤️❤️❤️❤️
Don’t ever change for nobody ever again! I loved your loud personality you reminded me of myself. I noticed a change in you becoming quieter and it wasn’t you. So sad but it’s a new you so be loud!! Be out there! Let everyone be jealous cause your very pretty person!
It seems like the trolls were trying to make u act like boring Catherine
I am so glad you are healing and doing the best to provide the best life for you and your baby. I am sending you and your daughter well wishes and hope you make it. Also, A+ for adding helpful links to DV survivors.
Wow Shyla I’m so proud of you and how much you have grown as a person .
I’m super proud of you ❤️
This video helps and speaks to so many, thank you
🙏🙏🙏👌👌👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ You're a strong woman
Girl I hope I can find what you have in me… i have tried to dig myself out of a hole but somehow I still am in the same one.   P.s planning to move in with my sons father but he tends to say things like “you always get what you want” “you don’t make good decisions” idk what to do. Our son has CP I can’t work because I have to take care of him full time and I live with my parents. I have no support system from them much or anyone(friends I have none) so it feels like I have to move the dad to get some help and support but I don’t know if it’s worth it when possibly being abused verbally. I’ve seen my parents in a verbal abusive relationship and I had set my eyes to also no be in one and here I am but without many choices. I tried to start my own small business but failed cuz I don’t have no support around me or have any friends.
I fucking love you. So happy for you & soul 💗
Me and Soul have the same birthday ♐️
I love this new shyla🥺💕💕 I’m with you every step of the way.
❤️❤️
So proud that you are doing things for yourself and achieving goals you never thought would accomplish. Love you !
Props to Shyla! She doesn’t need Landon. She’s better on her own. If I was a mom I can’t do what she does. She’s a superwoman and a good mom to her daughter.
You are amazing!
Just never forget that you are such a beautiful, strong, courageous, sympathetic, empathetic , amazing woman and mom to your daughter, and you will persevere through all the evil in the world. We love you
I’m so glad your sharing this. It’s really helpful for others in like situations to see why to keep going. Very inspiring to see a woman thriving and being their authentic self!
Love you shyla. This video is wholesome ❤️
Shyla!!! So nice to see and hear you love! I felt it in my soul when you said you weren’t going to roll over and quit. So many women are behind you and rooting for your success, Keep going Queen!
You’re such a strong woman 💗!
Peace & blessings to you Shyla✨I always felt in my spirit that you were going through things behind closed doors. His spirit is very dark & demeaning. I'm so grateful that you made it out & are truly living your life like God had planned for you💖
You’re BEAUTIFUL!!💕❤️
i literally love you. so happy to see you’re healing. we need more of these 🤍

So off topic but how is it that Shyla ended up with all the dogs when Landon was the one that wanted them ? For example pickles didn't Landon buy him ? 🤷‍♀️
WOW…shyla this video really touched me. you’re the definition of a strong woman. I hope god blesses you and soul in so many different ways. You’re doing an amazing job as a mommy for that beautiful baby I’m so proud of you for not only coming back up after that asshole did everything he did to you but showing him what really matters in life. Praying for you and soul to heal, and to shine like the beautiful stars that you guys are. Love you and always supporting you both! 🤍🌟

I know how you feel my love I have been through this kinda situation bullying by your partner, physically and mentally torture like i was so in fear of doing anything because of him, now that i left him i feel far way better and found the right guy who respect and care me so much.

I think u getting away and being on your own and not trying to be an Ace Member is the best thing u can do for u and your beautiful daughter  You seem sooooo much happier
I'm soo proud of you shyla 🥰 honestly. Let God heal you and your family , and God bless you and your baby . I can relate to the same story of abuse that you experienced as well . I have 2 kids of my own I thank God everyday that I am able to come strong and leave something so massive. 🙏 I pray everyday.  I appreciate your story . Love you beautiful 😍 🤩

Just goes to show when your happy from within you start glowing from the outside.❤️
Shula, you should read the book “It ends with us” your story is almost identical to the book.
People love to assume what they don’t know. Everyone experiences things differently. Her truth is her truth and his truth is his truth.
NAAA I’M CRYING STREAMS OF TEARS...THIS ONE HIT HOME. SO SO SO PROUD OF YOU SHYLA WALLAH ❤️❤️

I’m rooting so hard for you, you’re inspiring so many single moms
Did anyone else's audio not match up with the video?
Got my 🪙 ready girl!!
♡♡♡
Deep down somewhere in her heart , she still has feelings for Landon , yes they hurt each-other but their love was pure.
She posted Sloan and chisme/Danny the two people I watch and love !
When I say I laughed this whole video. Pitty me the whole video. So you can show soul but her FATHER can’t? Funny && soul healing from her trauma my girl lmaooooo this girls a whole joke
Been through something very similar 🙏🏽 stay true to yourself and your family 💕
But u are liar
Shyla I can’t imagine what your going through I jus wanna say I’m so sorry your going through this. I’m very proud of you and wish you nothing but the best. You are a beautiful strong woman.
Just gotta say I went through that nearly exact relationship and having kids at your age, it’s a shame it’s so common and I’m so proud of you for getting out… took me WAY longer than you, girl! I’m in my late 30s and FINALLY happy. It’s so refreshing to see someone not Catherine McBroom—fake, dead eyes, dying inside, using her children for money not inspiration, acting like everything is beautiful. You are the real deal.
Love this but a bit blurry
you seem way happier
Proud of you 💗
Your my inspiration I wish I could share my story
Nose job 😂
I’m confused, I thought you didn’t want your daughter on social media?
God’s grace and blessings on you and you’re daughter. Only good things to come for you, moving forward. ❤️❤️
I hope you make it and become really successful and wish you and your daughter the best! I hope you make it big 💕
This video is so well edited♥️♥️!
This is why no one has the right to judge someone base off a video because one thing for sure is that the scariest people is the ones who maintain quiet because you never know the shit they go through or the stuff they hide and they hide it too well....I'm glad Shyla is free and able to be herself even though there are still people who attack her but she knows her worth and the glow up ❤️
Well done Shyla!!! So so proud of you! ♥️
Very proud of you 💛
i am so excited for you on this new journey shyla!! if inspires me more to do what i am passionate about and just go for it. life has so much purpose and so much meaning, and you are living proof 🤍 loving you always
I just know Landon and his family is just watching this with hate IM PROUD OF YOU SHYLA !!! Literally drop your brand ASAP I’m ready to buy your merchgo
I love you Shyla you are a strong your story is amazing I can't wait for part 2 and whoever edit your videos are awesome 😎 it's amazing and you look so beautiful 😍
I want to start by saying "I am so sorry Shyla". I judged u back in LS videos. I judged u hard after all the issues that happened. But today, when I see this video all that comes out of my mouth is "I love you". You gave so much into the relationship, to the channel, almost went unnoticed by me and many others. You didn't deserve that bad ending. Well what i can say is u guys grew out of love and i can see a bright future ahead of u! How u made peace with Souline's dad and invited him over for her birthday was the first step of ur own peace and growth. Wishing u lifetime of happiness and growth. UP AND FORWARD FROM HERE❤️
This was AMAZING! So proud of you.
Shyla you look prettier than ever I didn’t even know that could be possible
We love you shyla
You have no idea the lives you are inspiring. You give women hope that there is light after the trauma. I pray God continues to pour favor over your life. Thank you!
Shula you’re a queen! You’re so strong and such an inspiration. Keep going boo, love u and i see ur purpose 🤍🤍🤍🤍
This video made me cry, it is so pure and although in the midst of healing Shyla I know God is and will always be by your side and will be your strength through the hardships. You’ve already made impact on so many. Brought light to subjects normally pushed under the rug. Lead by example and given strength and courage to those who are living that nightmare. Your good soul and heart shines Shyla please never dim your light for anyone. ♥️
🤍
Shyla my girl why you do me like that 😂 you have me scratching my head and refreshing my phone every 5 minutes to see if the second part is up 😂 sending hugs and love to you and your daughter YOU WILL BE SUCCESSFUL ❤️
Girl Power 💗
So proud of you Shyla you are amazing <3 love youuu
We love you shyla ❤️
I hope Catherine can do the same
Shyla you are an amazing women and mother. You are strong and very wise. Keep your head head high ❤️❤️
My strong mama ♥️ I love you Shula I’m glad that you are keep well and doing well ♥️😘
I am so proud of you🥺
You are an inspiration
I've always loved Shyla but THIS👆SHYLA gives me POWER, SECURITY, STRETCH, WISDOM AND GENUINITY💪🧡❣
Loveeeee thisssssss
YASSS GO SHYLA !!!
I love to see it!! As a mama, I can understand the exhaustion you must gone through to raise your baby! Keep going! You’re gonna go far and I cannot wait for your brand to drop. ❤️
I wish someone told you, when you were younger, why people bully you. You are beautiful, smart! You get hate comments, Bc of that. People don’t like seeing you do good. Pick on you and love bringing you down, bc it makes them feel better. I’ve been following you for so long. Your not loud at all, your funny asf. Not only that you have amazing style! Gurl you know your doing good, when someone is putting you down and being mean asf to you. That’s how you know your doing good. Remember people don’t like that or like seeing that. People will always talk, that’s just how it is boo. Keep your chin up 💅🏽, you is a bad bitch period 💃
❤
This is beautiful .!!!
I absolutely loved this.  You deserve the world and all the bullies and ex partner can <>€^ %}}.  You gained yourself.  I will always watch your channel.  Love you.
Shyla you are a beautiful soul , continue to keep healing and never stop being you. Love with all your might in this world, don't ever let this world get to you. Do it for the girls that can't at the moment.. you are inspiring.
What song is that in the intro? 😍
When you & your ex were together I never watched your videos. But now I subscribed and liked your video because you seem more genuine and I can just feel a vibe from you!! Good luck in everything you set your heart to✨✨✨✨💗💗💗
Cant wait for part 2 - loving these series vibes. You can see that Shyla is in her comfort zone and making videos that mean something to her and not forced
I’m so glad you overcame everything Shyla! I’ve been watching you since day one and I never really understood why people would bully you. You have an amazing soul and you’re an AMAZING mother!! Keep pushing forward 🤍
Proud of her💗
Im here for strong independent women. Cheers to you girl first for recognizing and changing and seeking light. Enjoy this new journey and this new you. Enjoy
wow girl your most def the strongest women ever! keep pushing thru it! the little girl has the best mom ever !
So happy you are telling your story It is so important love you shyla you are so strong
Appreciate you sharing your story, Shyla. The influence and reminders that of reassurance that you have on many single moms, daughters, ladies, women in this world is appreciated!! xx 🤍🙏🏽
All I got to say is half the world couldn’t go through what your going through! The amount of strength you have is unbelievable! Trust in yourself and in god everything happens for a reason keep the grind 💪
So proud of you and can't to see everything that you having coming up 🙂🙏🏾
I'm so happy !! I can't wait for your next video
Love to see strong momma’s making it happen for their baby’s such an inspiration , rooting for you ❤️🙏🏼
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You deserve to be happy 🙏🏻💖
Queeen 🔥
Pop off queen !!!!
Thank you for posting this. I am going through a somewhat similar situation and having this video is really inspiring. Because I felt like I couldn’t continue but I know I can.
So proud of you Shyla 💜 keeping shining ✨
Can wait for the day you find true love a real man and we can see more smiles in your face. Strong women 💜
Strong women 🙌🏽🙏🏽 god bless you love you so much!❤️
First of allll i’m so glad you’re in a better place mentally & physically😍 haha & being a super Mom to Soul.. she is soo beautiful & both of you deserve the 🌎 💖. Idk who’s you’re editor or if it’s you’re cameras but this looks bomb af! Can’t wait to see what the future holds for you & Souline🥰 Love u guys & stay safe!!!❤️❤️
Shyla, you don’t understand how many people you have inspired, especially me.  I’ve been going through the same thing for almost 2 years with my daughter of 2 years. I live in Cali, and i’m not trying to ask for money but I would love maybe an opportunity working for you queen. You are an inspiration to other women, and maybe some dads too. Keep working towards your passion mama!❤️
I can’t wait for the next one the intro looks so professional I don’t think you realise how happy we all are that your back and actually have been working on this behind the scenes while us lot didn’t know what was happening, so happy for you shyla ♥️
It’s so important to release the toxic in our lives and to heal from it. You go, Shyla!!! Praying for you and your daughter.
You got this momma, SHYLA IS BACK AND STRONGER THEN EVER,✊🏽👊🏽💪🏽 so glad things are starting to come up for you despite the challenges and loses you've experienced on the way, never lose hope of your dreams becoming reality, love you Shyla, happiness looks beautiful on you,  glad to see you smile again back on your grind❤
So proud of you! Being a single mommy is extremely hard but your children is what makes you stronger and helps pull you through!
Happy that you are happy 😊
Its funny how everyone was blaming Shyla initially and hardly anyone was defending her.  Only few of us were defending her. Everyone kept saying she is jealous of catherine , does not get along with Landon's mom, that she controls Landon etc etc. I was supporting her all along. Now everyone suddenly is her fan. But now when everyone is supporting her and I still do but I just feel for her daughter's sake its good both Landon and Shyla not to share too much and be more private. Shyla is smart ,she will do well and at the end Landon is her child's father and  i remember a video where Landon blasted all her haters when they were together. So best of luck to both . Pray for healing of heart Shyla.
You are the best in life  I’m very proud of you 🙏💜🥰😍😘🎆💖🙏
I’m so proud of you Shyla. I admire your courage because I’m sure this took a lot for you. Good people will always end up blessed and bad people will always receive their karma. You did not fit in that family, you were too real for them. Bullying is never ok but you proved your strength and showed how boss you were. After this I had to unfollow all of them, I don’t look at them the same. I’m excited for your new journey. You have all of my support
Great job shyla
always liked shyla
I always watch the Chanel for Shyla and soul …. Always loved her and her energy I’m glad she’s out of that toxic family..
Strong you shyla❤ you're very very inspiring. More power to you girl.
You’re a super woman 🤍
💕💕😭😭 this video made me cry it really is crazy how strong us females are
I love this so much! Keep your head high queen! ❤‍🔥 My dream is to also have my own brand.
God always looks out for his, trust him through the storm, he will never leave you💕🙏🏽 l don’t comment on videos but l see Gods hand on you. You are beautiful inside and out. May God keep blessing you and your beautiful child🧡
But how can he kid nap his own kid ? Just Bc she’s the mom doesn’t mean the baby should go with her. Idk just hope are doing better healing ❤️‍🩹
You are truly beautiful 💓god bless you and your precious daughter and never let anyone steal your shine.
so happy you got out of the rut! I knew you could be something more w out L. Soul will be so proud of you! Can’t wait to see your new videos on here & Congrats on your brand! I’ll be supporting that for sure!
the smile on your face says it all girl so proud ❤️❤️
What a strong soul you have! ✨🦋 Love yah, keep it going 💪🏼
I love the raw Shyla. I’m very happy that you got out and found yourself 💛
I LOVE YOU and really admire you soo much . Such a motivational video! I’d look back at this 100xs if I have too! Keep it up Shyla it takes a lot to get where you are! ❤️
They should both stop dragging eachother for the sake of their daughter and live life. Cause at the end of the day, it's them both that Soul is come to.
So excited to watch your journey !!!!!!! 💓💓 YASSSS the come up 😭❤️❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 love you
I couldn’t imagine my life being flipped upside down like that, and having everyone who you thought would be there for you against you. But it’s all about breaking that cycle girl, you did it. And your daughter will see what a superhero you were and how brave you were for her ! 💖💖💖
It’s sad how much haters influence us even when we don’t want to care
Well when u lie about something serious people will hate on you sorry..
Watch Landon's video.
❤️❤️❤️
I do wish you knew from me personally that I think you are so beautiful always!!! You have been someone I admire and still am.. but this video did help me see alot..in reality were all human and I guess I just understand I love how beautiful and relatable you are. I am one of the first watchers I hope to think so that I am lol and I'm realizing what's the point in all of it .. thank you but non the less I see how strong you are and all we can do is keep going no matter what happens in our lives.. we're human beings ..people forget that sometimes.. wish you all the best always. I'm here.
I also had a c section on October 27th, 2021. We are so strong! 💪 I love you Shyla! Be proud of yourself! You deserve all what's best!😇🥰💖
I want to know more and I’m so happy that you are back
Love you!!!!
Yasss love this queen! Proud of you!! Keep going, God definitely has something beautiful in store for your life 💖🥰
I don't have Instagram, can't wait for part 2 and to watch your channel.
So inspiring! 🙌🏽 especially since I dated a narcissist for such a long time that completely destroyed me. Currently finding myself and it’s the hardest thing to do. 💕 but it’s nice to hear the grass is greener on the other side and I can get passed this and go for my dreams! God bless you and baby girl! So proud of you 👏🏽
Wish you the best ❤️
Keep pushing and show em them stacks of cash by your ear again …..💪🏼💵
☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌 Ya know I personally never got the vibe that your were born with a silver spoon and I had no idea how you were so bubbly & down to earth in your intros long ago. The bullying was so bad to where even I was curious who the real Shyla was and if I was missing something bc I thought you were cool. Proud of you for growing! Many years ago I was in a dv relationship for almost 5 years. Swore I would never stay with someone like that too. I'm free from that life thank God. It breaks you down it really does.  I see your heart in your dreams. Im so sorry about your sister.  May she rest in paradise.   -Much Aloha! !  ☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌☮️🌌
I’m glad you’re doing a lot better 🥺 your daughter will be so inspired how strong you are x
Shula your such a inspiration I look up to you I’ve dealt with severe DV before when you get out and start new you learn you have to focus on yourself
so happy for you & how far you’ve come, keep building from here!
Women are so strong! Shyla, you are so strong! This video shows that leaving a toxic situation, and having to start all over again is sometimes the best because you find your true self and build character even when times are rough! Im glad you left that’s extra weight behind and worked on your self to make sure you are good. Take care of you first, you can’t be a great mommy if u not at your 100! This inspires me so much! You are super human, and you are doing your humanity work showing women to never settle and know your worth! I’m so happy for you shyla! I wish nothing but happiness and abundance for you and souline! Thank you for showing your side even u don’t have to or owe anyone. You are an amazing person, mother, daughter, aunt, sister etc. keep going strong! Your supporters will have you back through it all and support you and your business! ✨
Shyla, you’re truly a humbling soul with such a pure heart!! Thank you for this 🤍💫🪐🧚🏼
I can definitely say I write mean comments or even just think them. Ever since I’ve had my baby my perspective on things have changed. I now understand how much hate comments can get to you. Now I watch your videos and I’m like wow she’s my inspiration.

You truly truly inspire me Shyla. I’m beyooond proud of you and am amazed at your growth and maturity about this entire situation.
Are there bruises on her chest ?
A couple things stand out about you: You are very creative. You are very driven despite the opposition. That’s very inspirational. There are not many woman that I look up to because most YouTubers are shallow but I really do admire you.
Landan needs help ...so glad your doing well 💞 love you and your babygirl 🙏

Thank-you for being so candid, vulnerable and sharing your story. You look so much happier now and we love to see it! You are absolutely stunning and your daughter will someday understand that you were the biggest role model to them in leaving a toxic situation behind.

QUEEN SHYLA👑💖 blessings!!
What goes into a woman’s brain to think let’s get pregnant. When you’re not in a happy or healthy relationship? Like honestly what is it.
I use to see all that bullying and wonder why people target those who are a ready going through it. Look at you with .5 million followers already and I only have 3! LOL we love you Shyla…please continue doing YouTube for those of us who would watch you religiously and TRULY admire you. You’re beautiful inside and out…
Ive always loved you and will continue to! ❤️ watching all of his family’s video and yours, you stood out and felt genuine and real. I was so confused seeing hate comments about you when it all started. Continue to shine ✨❤️
we are so proud of you 💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜
Shyla being Away from all negative vibes, I see you glowing more. Life can be a struggle love. But your doing the best thing for Soul and for yourself. "M" family has put you in places you shouldn't been in. But you grew and left for the better! I'm proud of you love!!! I love your channel and I'm glad you finally have one of your own! Before I forget have you changed your care products? Your glowing even more and I love it darling!
Yes baby!! Yes!! Keep pushing baby keep going! ❤ I am so proud of you!

The blame game still 😂
Way to go shyla 💕
You look so beautiful 😍
You’re such a great mother! Wishing you the best! && by the way your beautiful ! You got this !! Luv ya
Hahaaaaa don't worry we all hate the ace fam and all they're followers/ sibling. You need to let them all go and do you and do it good for your baby. Don't worry about them, you got this!
Good luck!
You are one amazing person keep reaching for the stars you got this sending prayers love ya 🙏🏼🙏🏼❤️❤️💐💐
Idk you on a personal level, but I’m so proud of you. No matter how many times things/ppl tried to knock you down, you didn’t stay down. You grew through all that pain, and it’s going to make you into the best version of yourself. Thank you for sharing this progress with us. We’re here to support you.
We often follow with what we understand and grew up with. You found familiarity in dating someone who your father was like! Be at peace with yourself  for recognizing, learning and pushing forward 🤍
Your such a beautiful woman inside and out 😍
You’re strong queen, I can’t wait for part 2 🙏🏼💗💖
Oh how I have missed you lady! So happy to see you again
I’m not even half way through, but I’m so proud of you !!!! I absolutely love you girl. I can’t wait to see you blossom. You’ve been through so much, but sometimes it takes a bunch of heart ace to pop !!! I pray for much more success not only for you, but for little souline 🤍✨
The feeling I get from the beginning of the video is “she’s happy and finally being her” I love it Shy 😍♥️
I am sooo sooo proud of you shyla!
Is insane how much pain you can feel while watching this video and at the same time feel so happy she is doing better. Girl I don’t know you but I wish I could give you a hug and tell you “you are doing just fine and will continue to achieve all your dream” and all while being an amazing mom 💛🙏🏻 much love to you darling!
I'm so happy to see you doing so well💕 Seek the Lord he can give you peace that surpasses all understanding!*Psalm 103
We are so so proud of you! Reach for the stars baby girl and never look back
#foreverteamshyla SO PROUD OF U GIRL!!!!❤️

I’m also a single mom. This inspired me so much 🤎
You got this.
What happened to your nostril? It moves so much when you talk. Hope you’re okay.
I love you shyla your are strong we are all here for you.
You are goals and although luge is tough right now I would love for you to know you motivate so many of us to never quit. You are made differently you’re a blessing
Wow Shyla I'm really proud of you
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Shyla you are Amazinggggg!!! You did something most women (me🥺) have trouble doing...getting out and living the best life for you and your child!😩🥺❤. I'm so here for your journey and hope to one day be as strong as you🙌🏽🥺❤.  Edit: I could cry...when you said you strive so hard to end up opposite of being w/ someone like your Dad...and end up damn near in a replica of your parents situation 😭😭😭...I literally question myself every damn day ...like how did this happen?😭😭😭💀
This is exactly what I was hoping for. Turn your trauma into something for you & soul. Which no one can ever take away.
May God give you strength and peace God bless you and your family ❤️
Support you girly 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
❤❤❤i love you so much
Getting out of an abusive/toxic relationship is extremely hard. I’m going through the process right now and I didn’t realize how isolated and how brainwashed I was into believing that the relationship I had with this person is how a relationship “should be”. Once those blinkers are off you realize and see what everyone has been telling you about for years.
I love this! Thank you for sharing your story. I wish I could watch those videos of when you were pregnant and soul was born/a baby.
🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼
We’re all rooting for you babe! Your story speaks volumes and you don’t even have to say anything we see your authenticity and genuine heart. God wouldn’t put us through anything we couldn’t handle and every downfall is like this thick armor that is protecting us as we age. Your story inspires many. An if it’s just sharing your story you already did enough, I truly believe god speaks through us. Thankyou for your vulnerability always ❤️
It’s so funny how rich people think doing daily tasks that normal waged people do all day long is struggling 🤣 no nanny? Cooking dinner every single day? Omg.
You’re a successful woman Shyla, you got up on your own feet. You inspired me.
Ok I know this is a bit off topic but, are the plants behind you avocado plants?
Your strong thanks for sharing your story 💖
Bet they mad now huh 😏
I feel like I’m watching a tv show 😂😍 I love it !!
YAAS QUEEN 🙇🏻‍♀️
I wish you nothing but the best this year beautiful . I’m glad you have overcome your obstacles .
The best things stem out of crappy situations.
When your hair is blonde you remind me of Rita Ora❤️
🤍
I’m proud of you 😇😇😇❤️❤️❤️
I’m extremely proud of you shyla!! Never give up 💕💘🥺✨ it’s your time to shine!!!!!!!!! Keep going! God brought you this far and he won’t leave you!❤️ love you!
This was so good. Thank you for sharing. Stay strong
You got this Shyla!!! 👏
Everything about seeing you get back up and slay makes me so happy!!
Stay strong Shyla no form of abuse is ok. We women have to support her.
You are soo strong and independent..regardless of everything you’ve been through you fought for you and your daughter..this just shows how awesome you are 💕..you are the true definition of a strong woman 💗
You’ve inspired me shyla I’m 6weeks pregnant and going thru it 😢 but I know there’s a light at the end of all this.. keep your head up boo ❤️❤️
I love this version of you! ❤️ you are now happy and most importantly free! Freedom looks good on you. Now we can see the wonders you’ll accomplish in life for you and your daughter. You are not alone honey. What you went through is not ok we got you’re back! 💋
Yaasssss queen! Keep slaying. Ugh you're amazing
Shyla, I’m going through the exact same thing thing as you right now. I’m glad you are being so open and honest, you made me realize I’m not alone. I’m not the only one, you give me hope and this video was very needed for me. Healing is such a lonely process
Boss 👏👏 you got this girl 🙏🏻💯
Is this an ad? Or a video for pity? I’m confused.
Inspiring 🙏🏻
I'm very proud of you young lady.... You deserve to be happy.
PLEASE DROP THE BRAND NOWWWW IM READY TO SPENDDDD
She's definitely still in love with him why she can't stop talking about him in every video... time for some new material
Nice to see you again Shyla.... Life is not easy for sure. We just have to make difficult choices but you can always learn and continue being strong. These are just tests in life. Without taking any sides, it is you who has to deal with what you have to deal with in your life and give up (which is not a good choice) or be strong to continue and win every battle. But please, always trust in the Lord. Put him always in front and all puzzles will end up in place for you at a time he wants.  God bless you, can't wait to see the 2nd part. Wake up every morning and say THANKS to God because he gives you guidance. We need him... Amen ♥
Ur back we have missed you! I remember u telling us this story on L&S channel! Is this a documentary and we gunna see more? Can’t wait! U look so healed and happy.. I admit I judged but that was in the past I love ya
YOU GO GIRL YOU PLAYBOY! 😍⛹🏾‍♀️
I’ve never been one to read comments so I had no idea what was even being said. I’ve always loved Shyla and thought she was the best! So inspirational!!!!
Keep healing and growing Shyla!!! You’re doing amazing. ❤️❤️ we love and support you🤞🏼💗
Oh my Girl your Story is beautiful 😍 I can’t wait for part 2 ! God puts you where your supposed to be at the correct time . 🙏🏼🙏🏼 You are glowing your smile 😊 says it all no one said it will be easy but he will guide you in the correct path. Sending a big hug 🫂 for your Daughter and you! ❤️🙏🏼 God Bless
I’ve never watched you before, found you  through Sloan! But you are inspirational!  I’m subscribed and I can’t wait to see your content!❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love that you put this video so many YouTubers try to act like it’s all rainbows and sunshine and don’t show the raw truth I love that about you wish you and your baby girl the absolute best 💗
So proud of you Shyla! You truly are an inspiration ✨ 🙌
Shyla why are you trying to sound like the Kardashians???
im so happy things are working out for you. your sister is with you through this journey 🤍
HERE FOR YOU. YOU GOT THIS GIRL ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Everything seemed genuine until she said her goal is to win a humanitarian award. If you truly were a humanitarian you wouldn’t even care if you got an award.
You’re really well spoken and so different than the vlogs. Clearly you weren’t being yourself. This is a good start!
You are doing the absolute best that u can be towards urself and ur daughter! Wowwww ur amazing ❤️
Round of applause for this Women 👏👏 Shyla your so strong.
Wow Shyla. I’m so fucking proud of you I don’t even know why but I teared up watching this. Souline has the best mommy in the world.
I'm so glad she's so nicely about landon
You are so strong and the most amazing mom. You’ve got this 🖤🖤
You’re amazing Shyla. I am so proud of you ♥️
idc what anyone says or thinks, Shyla is so intelectual and poised 🤌🏻💖
U go girl... proud of you..
I'm so proud of you shyla. Keep grinding for you and baby girl. You are doing great !
this was nice!

I love the intro
Im ready for part 2! 💛✨
When you said you fought so hard to not have a relationship or a guy like your dad and still got wrapped in the toxicity I felt that! Wow this speaks volumes so inspiring!
The best thing you can do is be yourself!!! Don’t fake to be anyone you don’t want your daughter to be. You are amazing!! Amazing things will happen to you just be yourself! Looks how Catherine is , unfortunately she is cornered trying to keep up with all the lies.
I can see how much you’ve changed since he is gone. You look so happy and I’m so happy for u that you got out of that relationship ❤️Stay strong Shyla we love you
I love this !!❤️❤️ She is an inspiration!!❤️🙌🏽
You’re truly amazing and gorgeous! You inspire me Shyla.

What even is this
My son was born 12.19.19 too!!
I’m as proud of you as I am proud of me for leaving my toxic relationship too. So happy for us
Healing and growth..I'm here for this!! Just what I needed.🙏❤ so excited for you and your journey. This is awesome, and I think what a lot of other young women need to see.🙌🦋
And people think about why Catherine hasn’t broken up with Austin. This was only Shyla and Landon can you only imagine the ace family? I’m so proud of her, because she spoke up. We all know this family has a tendency to keep secrets, and she didn’t let having a child with this man keep her quiet 👏♥️
One thing I will never forgive myself for was judging you and thinking you were a prude, when the entire time, you were suffering. I’ve definitely learn my lesson….and now I only judge the Ace Family😌🤣  No but seriously, the shock of finding out Landon is the type of person he is.
She’s full of sh…. 😂😂😂
I love you ❤️ shyla
You have such a beautiful soul!
Youre so young and inspiring ❤
Im just waiting for my oppurtunity to get a women like you shyla and make you the happiest women on planet earth cause you really really deserve it 👍❤
Of course Landon would try to make it about him by posting an hr after this video. Such NARC.
This video gave me the chills all over my body . The way you share your story . And how much myself and so many of us can relate. I’m happy to watch you and see this raw version of you . I can’t wait for your journey and content . Keep standing tall Shyla . 🤍✨
This was incredible I want part 2!!!! Thankyou for being so open & honest it's soo refreshing to hear your real transparent story! that is so rare these days on yt everyone is so fake ❤️
Yess shyla engery is big international 🙌I'm a also a young mother going through DV & ma daughter was going through I step up yesss i love you shyla we here for u ❤#BossUpShyla💖

There’s light at the end of every dark tunnel 💓
You are an absolute hero. This is so inspiring and powerful. I am so glad you made this series on your YouTube. It’s raw, real and what influencers should portray on their channels. Not fictional fantasy lives. Love you Shyla❤️
I just wonder why Catherine didn’t help her.
Loving the documentary vibes, behind every strong woman is a story that gave her no other choice!❤️
💜💜💜💜
This made me tear up a bit 💖💖💖💖 thank you for being an inspiration and sharing your story 🖤🖤 Looking forward to watching the next chapter
“The only thing that kept me going was.. my brand” I swear she was going to say her daughter idk why I found that hilarious 🤣 Good luck Shyla you are your daughter’s inspiration so show her you can be fulfill anything! ♥️
My heart feels and has heard your story. Shyla, thank you for sharing ♥️
I’m so proud of you💖
You are a amazing women/ mother . Absolutely inspiring ! You look so gorgeous too as always 😉
Your such an inspiration girl!! I’ll be your ride or dye as I saw my mom go through the things you went through which made me work hard to have a better life for my kids! So happy your back, I can’t wait to see your amazing journey ❤️🙏🏼🦋
We love you Shyla ❤️❤️❤️
Landon breaking your heart was the best thing that ever happened to you, you’re a completely different person and we love it
Omg I can’t wait for the next episode has me excited for it!!! I’m so proud of you shyla Keep going Strong!  💋
Love this Shyla !!! God bless you and your family always , stay strong and keep prevailing 🦾🙏❤️
She’s healing and I’m so proud of you Shyla 🤍 I just know your daughter will thank you for everything and applaud you when she’s older
I love you!!
rooting for you!!!!
You both should drop the drama and keep it between you two, stop putting everything on social media, is like your daughter would see this and it’s going to hurt her how both of you have hate towards each other. Just stop it and move on privately
We are here for you !! Nothing but support and love and good energy heading to you ! You are a S T R O N G MAMA
This video was so good I feel like I need to watch it again! You are the definition of a fighter! Keep pushing girl.
I adore you 🤍 you made me realize that no matter how many people run you over, you get back up and dust it off ❤️ Adore you …God bless you and your lovely family since day 1
Yesssssss I’m sooo proud of you !!!! It’s crazy to think how much you’ve been through 🥺🤧 Your doing an amazing mommy !!!! Keep it up 💕🤞🏽
This honestly so beautiful
I didn’t want to point fingers and blame someone before knowing the whole story about this. But I remembered a video where Shyla said she was stopping YouTube. How overloaded she must of been looking after newborn soul and Landon when he was sick and then him just not helping at all with bills so she had to work double time to pay the bills. Then I remembered the time where LnS just wasn’t making videos. Because Shyla had stopped making them Landon was a kid and didn’t want too either cutting off the money from that and then Shyla had to jump back on even with all this other stress. I watched Landon’s videos, not to give him views but to see his POV and it looked staged whereas Shylas seems like it’s memories she’s recalling. Love you Shyla you were always my fav YouTuber ❤️ also, a piece of advice my mum gave me, don’t stop your career or dreams for a boy (or significant other). If they love you they’ll want you to go and pursue it and things will always work out with the right one. Love y’all ❤️
So proud of everything you have accomplished & will accomplish since leaving that wretched family. Honestly if I were you I would’ve put a blur over that mans face....
Love love love love
I don’t mean this is any hurtful way, but I did not enjoy watching L&S videos lol but I enjoyed only the S part so I pushed through& watched   But NOW… I feel like you grown and shown such an admirable amount of strength it feels like we finally get the full authentic Shyla, I am always praying for you and your family. Life is so so hard and I know you’re tired of having to be strong but you’re doing it, Soul has such an amazing role model, mom, & best friend!
❤️❤️❤️
Amazing!♥️
So proud of u shyla you can just see this different energy and glow shining on ur face from within its all natural it’s all you and this year is yours to bloom and rise above whatever and whoever tried crushing you!!! ❤️❤️❤️   P.s just wait until Austin and Catherine try to take ur idea or copy u I just see that coming
May God bless you always in all you do! Keep empowering Women!
GIRL, YOU ARE GLOWING! ✨
So excited for you girl!
💖💖💖
For those who are still picking side, its useless. The most important thing is that the victim is actually safe now.
Y0U ARE SO BEAUTIFUL SHYLA😍   PEOPLE ARE JEALOUS / HAVE NO LIFE AND JEALOUSLY IS NEVER A REASON TO BE A HORRIBLE PERSON TO OTHERS OR JUDGE SOMEONE!!   🧡
You are so strong ,amazing, a worrier, an unstoppable mother! Can’t wait to support you further on your merch!!!! 🙏🏼🎉
Classy! I applaud you Shyla ❤️ you are inspiring so many of us !
Did she get a nose job?
you still come back again and lie ???
You’re amazing. You deserve all the happiness in the world
Hi Shyla welcome back I hope you are doing well and staying safe and healthy 🙏🏼🥺❤️
i absolutely love your content so much. i can relate to a lot of things you’ve said and wow you’re literally taking words out of my mouth. please keep uploading and posting
😍😍😍😍😍😍We love you Shyla! your soo strong!
Catherine could never 😂
Wishing you all the best!!! Be so proud you made it on this healing journey it’s going to take you to your purpose for sure✨
Your looking amazing you got a beautiful glow you look happy and I’m glad you are overcoming your obstacles God Bless you and your daughter keep your head up high you a strong and a wonderful mother 💕
Stop you just need to stop with everything blaming your daughters dad and family. We don't know what really went down behind closed doors it just needs to be kept between you and him not posted on social media. Sorry if this is mean but it's true. From here on out focus on your daughter and Your career instead of hating on your daughters dad/family. That's her family too.
Is that money tree real?.. got damn she thick 😩 how can I get mine to look like that?
Yeah I remember seeing the hate comments and feeling bad for Shyla ☹️ no one deserves to go through that 💔
I enjoyed this. The editing and all was nicely done. Good shit Shyla. U doin ya thang 💯👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Woo Shyla!
Wow you truly are a super women! I hope everything goes well with you and for soul🤍 I love how positive you are ! Keep going and stay strong we love you👏🏼
I miss shyla and landon☹️
Really nice to know you're doing well and things are working out for you! ❤️
You’re story reminds me of ‘it ends with us ‘ by Colleen Hoover. You’re really amazing!
I’m 19 years old and literally going through the same thing with my baby’s father and it’s hard to take that big step in knowing what’s the right thing to do and separate.
Continue going girl!! Don’t let nothing get in your way!! Your having your breakthrough!!
I love this girl and what she’s about and absolutely everything. What a human being. God bless her strength and courage. Thank you for being such an example to young woman out there. So happy for you and your baby girl in this 2022 ❤️❤️❤️ God bless you infinitely.
Yesssss Shyla 💪🏼 BOSS WOMEN
Fake news
Women power I love shy and I’m so proud of you you’re a strong beautiful woman ❤️
Boyyyyyy, it took me 11 YEARS to know that I was with a narcissist. I never even knew what a narcissist or narcissist abuse was until I met Jesus 3 years ago and in the middle of last year, 2020, God told me to leave the relationship that I was in and showed me that my ex was a narcissist. Again, I never knew what a narcissist was but I always felt in my heart something was SERIOUSLY wrong with his character. One day God made me see a video on YouTube that said “Are you a Narcissist?”, so I was curious to know if I was 🤣 but after watching the video, it described my EX to the PERFECTLYYY. I was SHOCKEDDD. Then I seen another video that said “the signs of narcissist a abuse” or something like that and again, I was shocked to know I had the symptoms. When you are with a Narcissist, it’s easy for you to seem like the angry one in the relationship.
I love you so much for this
You did that! Took on your daughter & your 2 dogs. While healing, learning, working & being a single mother. You did it. We see & hear you.
It’s just so amazing to see how far she’s come. ❤️
It’s crazy bc I adored you at the beginning, then I misjudged you when y’all did the quiting YouTube. But then I see the girl that I adore the beginning once again .  Im sorry i misjudged you ! Keep shinning mamas 🤍
You are so inspiring
Love you so much!
Glad your back💕
Love this ❤️
The strongest person ever👏🏻💗I’m so proud of you and I wish you all the success in the world and happiness
Your healing process is amazing I am so here for the ride soul is so beautiful you and her went through it all and you guys are doing good

We love you shyla you are a strong woman ❤
I love you shyla im 100% behind you!
Here we go again
all i can say is that. SHYLA is so perfect.
the same people who left those disgusting comments are probably the same people that took Landon’s side & abandoned shyla in her time of need. But she’s good over here, the people who support here got her & will always be here for her. I’ve followed you on social media before i even heard of him or his family. I was here to see you grow🤍 i can sense that she’s starting her healing journey fully now, after the hell of a year she went through! im praying 2022 is full of nothing but blessings, growth & more healing for you & your baby girl. Love you Shy🤍
Yasss, yasss yasss!!! I cannot wait to see your brand grow. You're truly stronger than you think. 🥰
YOU ARE STRONG! ❤️ so happy for you babe, you & Soul deserve the world.
Now this is what I call healing 👏🏽❤️
Too all the people who talked so bad about shyla and said Landon took care of her THIS IS HER STORY both of them worked y’all bullied her for no reason
We’re so proud of you Shyla! ❤️
It’s not easy but the outcome is the most beautiful and the blessings that are awaiting you Shyla… are unexplainable 💓✨ I’ve been exactly where you are 2 years ago. We push and fight our way through without even knowing. Our children are the beauty through all of this 💓🥂 forever rooting for you! Love you dearly.
Wow this is beautiful!!!!
I love you!!!
I can’t describe how strong you are! Your such a super woman! Wishing you all the best with souline 🤍 and happy new year shyla! Will support you thru the end 🤍
I’d buy her merchandise over Catherine’s ANY giving day!! She’s so genuine and beautiful! 💕 Keep on queen 👑
Bullying is not OK! So proud of u queen 🙏🏻❤️ God bless you !
It is inspiring to see your story. Thank you for being courageous enough to share your personal journey with all of us. It’s going to change a lot of women’s lives seeing how you’ve overcome all that hurt and now you’re even stronger! xx
Shyla I truly truly hope you know HOW EMPOWERING THIS VIDEO IS!! I can relate so much to your pain & the burning desire to succeed in life ♥️🙌🏽
Omg can't wait for the next part ....God is awesome and he will always be there for you never ever give up your a strong beautiful young woman.....❤🙏❤
We love you shyla! This is a beautiful video. This is the content I enjoy to watch a pure and true video. Keep it up and we will be here for you through thick and thin. Keep shining 🙏🏼
Man, I am so proud of you! I wish I had your strength to leave my relationship and take my kids.  I have always prayed for you, because I could see the pain in you through the videos and see the truth about your ex. When one is a victim you can tell who else is before they even know. 🙏❤️"Souline was meant for your life for a soul purpose."
She is really a superwoman that can heal people just by words..
I'm going thru something similar but unfortunately I married the SOB. Someone once told me it's to a set back it's a set up for something better.
We love you and are so proud of you! Especially us who have dealt with narcissistic abuse 🖤
I’ve followed you for a while now and I have to say I am so proud of the woman and mama you’ve become!
You are incredible ❤️
🥰🥰🥰🥰
So proud of you Shyla…. 🥰🥰🤗🤗🤗🤗☺️☺️
We love you Shyla!!! You've been missed mama
What a beautiful and strong women she is... ❤️❤️❤️ I wish u the best of this life as well as ur daughter and ur family. Biggest fan
Shyla you have overcome so much i for 1 am proud of you for telling your story and am honored to be able to hear it!! #TeamShyla
When will part 2 be coming out I can't wait Shyla you are amazing keep being the beautiful woman n mother that u r love u so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯
the difference between the video you made speaking your truth vs this video is mind blowing. the attitude, the energy, the happiness, everything. i am so, SO happy for you. congratulations Shyla.
Its the deleted/archived video for me 😂
This right here. So happy for you finding your purpose! ❤️
You’re so strong and such an inspiration ❤️
Being a mom can bring such clarity.  It is often difficult if not impossible for us as women to put ourselves first and do what is best for us.  But when you have a child it is so clear what is alright and not alright for them and speaking from experience easier to push for what is the best and right for them when it is difficult for us to do for ourselves. I wish you the best of luck in your future for you and your daughter.  I hope you continue to find your strength for not only your daughter but for yourself.
Whitney Houston once sung a song 🎶 I didn’t know my own strength and played it for you Shyla!!! We are here for you!!! I love you and Souline so much!!! U will always be our queen!!! I can’t wait for chapter two and to buy the merchandise to support you both!!!
I absolutely love seeing you confident and truly happy! You deserve it!

Very proud of you for coming forth with your story for so many women who may relate to your story . Don’t give up , keep going . Us women are here to support each other . Always speak the truth . This is so real and raw . I’m so proud of you 👍 . Landon is probably shaking but he doesn’t deserve any attention , people like him need to be cancelled and hope you heal . We are here for you girl .
Shyla, I noticed your video time is 19:19. Research the angle number 1919 it's a beautiful sign 💗
yes shyla!! 🥺😭👏🏼👏🏼 we love you mama we are here for you mama
Why do I feel like she’s lying.
I really cannot wait to see this part 2 and this line of clothing you're gonna be dropping !!!! I'm so freaking beyond proud of you Shyla for everything that you've accomplished, all that you've survived and the strength you've gained from all of this ❤❤ There's not alot of women I've been able to look up to but you're definitely one i can say i look up to in so many ways because of how kick ass of a woman you are !!!! You have an amazing energy & the strength you carry with yourself is so motivating... Coming from an abusive household from all of my childhood and so so so many holidays, weekends & moments that were taken away from me as i was growing up because I myself and my brothers I had to be around it like it was just a normal thing. But it never was normal. It was never okay to see the things I've seen and been exposed to. And to see you get that and feel that you understand just gives me so much more strength.... Thank you for being real and so motivating to all Women including myself... Keep doing these amazing hustler moves you're doing !!! And thank you for everything you offer us just being the Woman you are. ❤🙏❤ We love and support you Shyla. 💘💘 Keep being amazing !!!!!!!!
You’re a true queen! Keep going! Always supporting you, better off alone!! 💛🥺😻🥳🙌🏼🙌🏼
Yes Shyla!!!! Women Power!!! I’m so happy to see you thrive through one of the hard situations any women could possibly go through. And you have no idea how inspiring this is to the rest of us 🤍👏🏼🙌🏼
Literally couldn't not hold myself together. I cannot stop smiling throughout the video. You are such a strong person. You are literally my role model. Going through the darkest of clouds and managing to find light. Wanting to start my own business just like you and having the dream of being my own boss. I cannot explain how much you've impacted my life in such an amazing way. I am soo happy for you that you are finally working for yourself and building your own future that you've been holding back for such along time. Cannot wait for the next episode 😫. You are one strong arse diamond. You've got this 💝. Comeback with a bang 💣💥. Luv it ❤❤.
Damn it's crazy to think how you went through all this sleepless nights with ur daughter. You deserve to be happy God saw you struggling an is leading you to new purposes in life.

I always knew you were super smart!  This is awesome to see! ❤️
🤍🦋✨
I love you Shyla you are truly so damn strong it makes me happy because I am a very young mother and just seeing you come out and tell your story and be so open about your trauma is truly inspiring but mostly you don’t even know how much of an impact you are doing by being so open and letting other females or anyone in general know it’s never too late and change is scary but you should never stay in a place or with anyone when it’s not good for you
Shyla we all love ❤❤
You are so pretty I’m so jealous I just wish I was you I wish I had family:(
Social media is soooo cruel I really hope you’re doing ok. I can’t even imagine love you girl ♥️♥️

Your a queen please keep going
I'm so proud of you Shyla God bless you and you're babygirl. May God continue to take you to bigger and better things that will continue to bless you in abundance. You're story has definitely touched me. I know what it's like to grow up with trauma and try best to not get with men that put you through that to end up somehow in similar or same. God never leaves us and as you see, he's only gonna bless you better girl.  You continue to trust in God and keep him #1 In you're life. 🙏❣️
That’s right baby! I’m so proud of you 💙💙
So proud of you girl don't look back

I’m just so grateful that my baby still talks about his papa. I’m glad that you got the short time to reconnect with you sister! Wasn’t long enough but it’s going to bring you so much peace when it’s ready🙏🏽🤍
You know you're healing when you can talk about your story with so much poise and clarity <3 sending you so much love x
since day 1 I have always admired seeing you. there is something about the look in your eyes that tell me so much about you. I wish you could see my comment I send you more blessings to go your way and also all the success in the world. I love your strong character.@shyla
I’m literally watching the video rn. And can i say I’m crying. I’m trying to get here, I’m in the same situation with my daughters father. I feel so connected to him, and i never thought of abuse like that. And when she put it that way… it is. I took care of my daughter basically by myself, and am still learning my new self. Im proud of her! Being a new mom is so hard, you learn so much about your life and the people in it. It’s amazing and truly inspiring seeing you happy☺️ Best of luck to you and your process
Love you 😍 Shyla ur very strong woman you’re a wonderful mother keep following your passion we got ur back I’m here for you always and forever 🥰💋😊
I’m so proud of you Shyla.💖
love when she said " i know i was strong but didn't know my own strength thru this"  <3  also lost my sister i can so relate right now<3
You’re amazing! Always have been always will be. I’m glad you got to see the strength we all knew you had!
@shyla all the best much love to you and ur daughter and condolences on the passing of ur sister Much love from .... watching all the way in Trinidad 🇹🇹

We are so proud of you Shyla‼️❤️‍🔥 There is no limit to how far you can go, so keep on pushing baby girl‼️ So sorry to hear about your Sister, may she Rest In Peace. 🤍 #WeLoveYou #WeAreHereForYOU
Absolute QUEEN shit. You escaped an extremely toxic environment rife with consistent abuse and manipulation and you did so while the whole world villainized you. I hope you know how incredibly proud of yourself you should be for continuing to show strength, courage, and determination. I know one day, when Souline is old enough to understand, she'll be just as proud of you as the rest of us are, Mama bear ❤️
AHHHH MORE LEGGINGS FOR THE GYM YESSSS

I truly miss seeing Soulines smile. Happy you found yourself shyla! You were shattered but you picked up your pieces and my goodness I hope you know how much more beautiful you are now with all these “scars” praying for you and your family
You’re so strong Shyla! It’s very inspiring to hear your story and see you on top! I don’t wish bad on anyone but the vengeance is most definitely God’s! God bless you and Souline❤️
I see both sides of your storied you and landon. I know what it's like to be on your end in a toxic relationship and no support to leave because my parents aren't there for me. But also landon has a side too, I am just glad you both can move on now.
I know exactly how your feeling I been currently going through the same thing for almost 2 years now my son is the only thing that keeps me from not giving up and here i am going through hell still but have 4 more months left of medical school , US MOMS ARE STRONG AND HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER ❤️ we love you ! keep going

I’m so proud of how far you’ve come 🥺💕🤗
Shyla give me khloe k vibes
shyla may God protect you from all these evil eye’s and keep bring you focus to do what you are supposed to do. remember that you done what it has to be done!
Shyla.. stay strong. GOD has control of everything and when you feel lost ask him for guidance. Hope all continues going well your such a strong woman! 💪
Anyone out there going through an abusive relationship, keep fighting for yourself. Your life is precious and you deserve to see (and live through) the beauty in it. May you all have a blessed and safe 2022. 💖💖

GO LITTLE ROCKSTAR!
i can’t stop looking at her nose
I truly heard you speaking shyla.....I heard you so purely and felt your grace . You have just inspired my thinking to get some situations of my life flipped on its head and to try find my passion...."" find your passion it will lead you to your purpose"" wow!! Those words hit right !!!! I'm really here for you to seeing you in a healthy so much lighter state......I felt the calmness of you and believed in every word you spoke........you shyla are a force to be reckoned with and I am excited to see your progress and wish you the absolute best in what's to come for you and souline and  your family.... I'm sad hearing about your sister and took a lot for you to openly share this battle your self and family are now facing ......... Thank you for sharing your video today your genuinely capable to reach the sky!  All the very best  Mandy from the uk xxx
Gooooooooosshhhhhhhh!!!! The journey  The vibe I’m loving the new you ! Keep climbing the climb
Proud of you shyla. Gave me goosebumps through out the whole video. You are a strong woman. Proud of you❤ you truly are an inspiration.
I'm really happy that you're happy, Shyla. It's important that you're taking time to yourself to heal. It's also important that you and the father of your child stay on a healthy co-parenting path. I understand your pain and frustration, but you and Landon keep continuously talking about each other publicly in a negative way. I'm curious of how the daughter is going to feel when she sees this online in the future. Just know tea channels like Sloan are happy because they have more material. Don't let leeches make money off of your pain and suffering. It's not fair to you.
Absolutely loveeeee thissss
Unfortunately they always say you find a man like your father.. you’re such a strong beautiful person 💜
Go on and thrive you deserve to chase your life dreams to make your daughter proud! 👏😊
Bravo 👏 mama bravo 🙌 !! This is awesome !! I’m so happy for you and your daughter ! Keep moving forward!! You got his !! Keep inspiring women to move forward!! Never give up!
Your such a strong women!! And I’m living for this new chapter in your life 🤍
THATS RIGHT HUN.  U NEVER KNOW HOW STRONG U R TIL BEING STRONG IS ALL U HAVE LEFT TO SURVIVE.  IM SO PROUD OF U.  I WAS A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTUM NOT JUST ONCE BUT 3TIMES.  MY DAD N 2 EX HUSBANDS.  U GOTTA B STRONG FOR U N UR BABY IN ORDER TO TAKE ON THE WORLD.  I REALLY AM SO HAPPY FOR U.
💖💖💖

BOSS ASS BISHHH. 2022 is Shyla’s year. Period
When SLO4N and Danny appear on shylas video 🙏🏼🧡.!!!! Much love to everyone
I love these types of videos really gives woman like you like me like so many encouragement when you’re in a bad relationship and you’re scared to loose it all that it’s ok to start all over again and make something of yourself on your own and with a kid love and positive vibes 💜🙏🏻
At the end of the day all you need is your family 💖
We love you Shayla❤️
You are so strong Shyla keep your head mama 🙏🏼🤍
Unless you’ve been drawn so far down emotionally and mentally, you’ll never understand her panic and fears.
I love this
I just want a GRWM video her makeup is always so fire 😍 love this btw
So happy for you girl 💗 getting away from that toxic family is the best you could have done for you and your child xx
♥️♥️♥️
Beautifulll video💞
Hopefully this inspires Catherine if she really is in an abusive relationship…
Your so strong 😭I’m so proud of you
Yesss. 😍 Wanting something for you!! Ahh I love love. This♥️♥️
Your are an amazing women keep Living your dreams😘
❤️❤️❤️
1 of the strongest ❤️
Gerartiomal curses. Almost everything that your mom or dad went through. You would too. Crazy huh
It’s crazy how you can literally tell that you were not yourself in that relationship. I feel like I can really see you now and it’s amazing.
Im looking up to you !! 🥰🥰❤️ so proud of you shyla !
You got this! 🤍❤️
I feel for you Shyla. When people step into the spot light and are always criticized it takes a part of that fire in an individual away. I always look at Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen and they have been in the spot light for their entire life and they now get away from it by hiding. The human race wants what we don’t have— always. You see well known people then we want to be well known, if you’re poor you want to be rich, curly hair then you want straight. It’s opposite desires we crave. But… we don’t want what comes along with being well known- being criticized , we don’t want the safety and negative changes  money can have.. and we certainly don’t want that new curly hair routine- but those curls are nice tho! Keep your head up ⬆️ you are a beautiful light DONT let anyone burn you out 💜
Hi Shyla! I hope you're doing well, inside and out. This is the start of your new year, your new beginning! You got this! 💕
Wow! This is a whole new person! I am 100% here for it! Battle scars are shining through your eyes! So happy for you m!
Love you 😘
I am so proud of you. Wow.
Did anybody else like…..scream when they saw SL04N or was it just me?😅😅I’m glad shyla saw the support she was getting from him ❤️💯
My dream is to get bigger on YouTube. I wish for it. But I don’t ever want to be popular. Or “famous” I guess. Too much hurt and stress. I’ve always worked hard for everything I have. Always. Love hearing your story. ♥️
Literally an inspiration ❤️i have watch you from the beginning and you have come a long way. Stay strong girl your empire is just beginning 👑
You go girl !
This was so beautiful. Thanks for sharing. 💕
Your story inspires me I’m currently living in my nightmare with my bd I’m ready to be at a the point you’re at moving on finding myself and being strong with my two babies praying for your healing ❤️‍🩹
So proud of you 👏 you're definitely a STRONG woman !
I’ve always loved watching you and that’s honestly the only reason why I even watched L&S (.)
GO SHYLA ❤ WE ARE ALL HERW FOR YOU & WITH YOU
Only the Strong survivor!!! This will be the Best Chapter of your Life 🤍
You’re inspiring, Shyla. Really loved this.
Love you so much beautiful keep fighting!!!!  God has you. 💜
Honestly both you and Landon are childish who can’t keep your problems to yourselves but making everything public without caring about what your kid is gonna feel about it when she’s old enough to understand. Stop playing the victim, you’re both on the wrong and that’s about it
I can’t emphasize enough how freaking inspiring you are to all of us but especially us morhers who watch you and follow you from the beginning! Sending you and souline endless blessings that will last you a lifetime 🤍✨
She’s fake they all are!!!
I love you and sending you more blessings for you and your daughter!! So inspirational!
You are amazing, shine bright❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Unless you’ve been in a narcissistic relationship it’s so hard to explain all of this without sounding crazy. Their families will always enable them as well. Ugh this kills me.
So like Ima need them beats in the video!!! What’s the name
we love you shyla!
Yas queen got her teeth done, hell yeah!
your fake nothing but fake stop lying and tell the truth the more you lie abt the situation the bigger the whole you’re putting yourself in

Shyla you are so strong ❤️
I love this and how wholesome you are as a mom and as a woman and I think a lot of us young moms look for this type of genuine support from being in a toxic parental relationship to being a single parent to picking up and grinding for our baby’s
Strong mama!!! We are here for you ❤️
You are a true inspiration Shyla!!! Wishing you lots of health peace and love!!
this video was just to promote her “brand”
This video makes me so happy for you! Shyla you are such a strong woman. You are a huge inspiration to many! 💗💗
I’m sensing a bit of healing. The fact she posted even a snippet of Landon’s face in these videos and was talking about her journey with him, it’s healing
So excited for this new chapter in your life! 🙌🏾
what a queen👸🏽
I love how her image is now being marketed properly
I love you shyla, you are amazing ❤

Wowwww this is awesome!!
So glad to see you back doing videos!
I would support her
I’m so proud of you ❤️
Your going through a cleanse in your life and preparing for your dream life that’s on its way. I believe in you 💕
Boring
Tearing up bc I really can relate
🙏🏻❤️😍🥺
You described it perfectly! I didn't realize how bad my relationship was until I had my son. I remember the moment it clicked. I was sitting in the hospital bed, it was like 2am, I was breastfeeding, and I was staring at my sons father asleep on the couch. I knew in that moment that it was never going to work between us. I tried so hard because of the baby, but I knew staying was only going to make it worse for my son. Now 3 years later, my sons father has only seen him 3 or 4 times and is struggling with drug abuse. It makes me sad for my son. Sad because he deserves a father that will love him and be there in a way that I can't. 💙
Shyla. You are amazing thank you for being so inspirational. I can truly feel your feelings
YOU GOT THIS MOMMA ❤️🙌🏼
WOW! Is what i have to say its amazing how happy you look and i see it all over your face. You are one strong woman, keep shining love you have all the love in the world!
Shyla is strong woman:’) i am so proud of her!!
I am so proud of you 💞
So excited to have you back. Wishing you success on your new venture, and this next chapter
Shyla. I’m always here for you and support you. Can’t wait to purchase your clothing . Sending you good vibes. More success and wishing you and Soul happiness. Love you!
Loved this! To get another side of you❤️ I am so happy for you and Soul 💞
This is amazing shyla! I can’t wait for chapter 2 I’m already hooked in! ❤️❤️ you are amazing!
The courage and strength our children give us is beyond anything a mother can ever imagine.  As a mother you pull through for them. Whatever may have happened in your relationship the good and the bad you are here NOW and you pulled through and this is where God wants you to be at this moment.  Continue to make shit happen and thrive!!! 👑
So strong and graceful💕

Honestly the best video ever! The most I felt connected to someone, Shyla I lost my brother 6 years ago well my only one and I understand the abuse and the cycle and loss and strength among many other things and what I see is resilience and just amazing growth. You will go even beyond what you thought u did. Keep being you and in life what I learned is well so far that I don’t regret anything because it’s my path and I take the positive from the negative and learn from it and that’s life best teacher! 🙏
A freaking superwomen! 💓💓

Awww I absolutely love this!! You are so loved!
Once my daughters were born, I was changed, I can’t explain it, I was still me but my thought process completely changed, and I started seeing things that I didn’t see before, I started seeing things through my child’s eyes, what if this was them, what will happen to them, is this okay. & I finally realized it wasn’t okay and it was abuse and I left!!! You shyla are such an inspiration and amazing women. We love you.
SHYLA!! I am so happy for you. You are strong for you and your daughter. Its so beautiful to see. Gives me so much inspo. You will succeed and make your daughter proud. Cant wait to buy from your brand! Sending love..

Im so proud of you that's the only word that i can say to you now darling keep it up in all time
So happy for you Shyla! Cant wait to see everything you accomplish
Random did she get veneers ?
So happy for you shyla! I'm so glad to see you glowing and growing from that trauma. I'm here for it ✨
Soo proud of you Shyla. You were meant for success no one can ever take that away . You are healing sis 💜💜💜
Love you miss Shyla 💚 you came so far.  And I’m happy for you
I believe you girl, I see that Landon was kind of one of that guys( abuser). An apple not far falling off from the tree!
YOU ARE ALREADY A SUPERHUMAN! inspiring, innovative, alpha woman, independent, loving, and genuine! keep going, Gods got you queen, we love and support you!
YOU ARE LITERALLY GLOWING!!! as a mom of 2 boys who also has had major loss, i truly admire this!! & feel empowered! thank u!! ✨
You are strong beautiful ❤️ we are here for you ❤️
Happy for you..your so strong and such a good Mom ❤️❤️
I've missed just listening to you talk. You are amazing! I am so happy for you!
Shyla girl you are so strong ❤️❤️
you have no idea how reassuring it is to see you grow into the healthiest version of yourself. I have been following you for some time now and I am beyond proud of who you're becoming, and beyond happy Souline has someone like you to look up to. you have been and continue to be SO brave, a huge inspiration for a lot of women, including the woman your daughter is going to become. and I know exactly what I'm talking about because Souline is going to be like me someday, with a heart full of pride and appreciation for her mom who did everything to protect her peace and well-being. looking forward to seeing more and hearing more from you, thank you for sharing your truth. love from Morocco!
No hate towards Landon, but it really blows my mind how he can do the things he did to shyla without feeling guilt. No matter how bad things were things should've been done differently
♥️
YASSSSSSSSSSSS SHYLAAAAAA YOUR SHINING
Sososososooooo proud of you.
I LOVE THIS!!!! It's so different from what we normally see on you tube. So proud of you! Keep it up! I'm routing for you girl!!!!!
keep glowing and growing!!!
I started this video and when you were talking of your upbringing I already was so proud of you, finding the positive in your experiences.. then you started talking about the brand and it shocked me, the way you spoke about it.. is the way I feel about the brand I’m starting, I want so badly to make sure I create a future for myself independently. After years of this idea I decided on a name today and registered my domain a few hours ago. I was seeing angel numbers all day and this just feels like another sign so thank you shyla! It really does take courage to take risks like this but it is so satisfying and wonderful to get signs I’m on the right path. Thank you!! I want to see your business grow as well & I promise I will be buying the minute you are ready to launch. I’m so proud of you shyla you are an incredible mother, daughter,sister and person 💜 never let anyone dim your light you have a purpose that is so much greater than you know 💜💜💜
So happy for you this is soo authentic ♥️♥️♥️ get knocked down 9 time’s but you got up 10 !! Go shyla
You go girl!! You look better and healthier❤
You go Shyla!! You’re a superwoman. We love you!!!
You are beautiful good luck with everything and keep going don’t stop you was meant to do something great
I love you ❤️ Such an inspiration ✨🥺❤️
You look absolutely gorgeous Shyla! You have a new "glow" girl! Couldn't click fast enough on this new video!💜

I’m so happy for you Shyla!! Your glowing!
WE LOVE YOU QUEEN!!
You are amazing🤍
We need part 2 ASP congratulations on the amazing woman you have become ❤️
“100% if it wasn’t for my daughter I wouldn’t be here” I felt that and had chills down my spin. I can’t relate so much shyla, so glad you posted this! ❤️ god bless 🙏
luvvv this
You have no clue how sharing your story helps so many people. You’re strong AF ❤️
I was always around for Shyla.  Shes so funny and down to earth.  Dont ever change or act different for anyone !  We love you 🥺
We love you!!
🤎🤎🤎
I'm so PROUD of who you became!!! 🦋❤️
You go Shyla !!!
Go mama,we are here for u!!!
You just inspired me to start vlogging and letting go of fear.. & truly living! You’re so strong queen💖✨
I can’t wait to see what you’ve been working on💞
Let’s see what she lie about in this video 😂 this crazy woman
Would love to see Part 2 and how far you've come!
So proud of you!!! I saw the warning signs in your relationship before it all went down. I’m so glad you got out 👏🏼 I wish you the best ! Praying you will cling on to Jesus during these times and that he blesses you with Favor through this all👏🏼🙏🏼
Ugh we love you girl! Us logically thinking humans know he’s a bad egg!
Happy New Years mama! New year new you, keep striving and never stop loving yourself because you are beautiful and so strong and most importantly Gods Child❤️🙏
We’re here to support you!
I love you sm! You're a great person and a wonderful mom! I believe in you! I'm rooting for you!
I think this is all ridiculous. My mom never bad mouthed my father to me she let us have our own opinion about him. STOP making things so public. Handle it between you two. If you really want to think about your daughter quit making things so public 🤦🏻‍♀️ you act like he was an abuse father to her and so shitty. Come on now. Things between you two are different then things between him and his DAUGHTER.
Proud 🥲 love seeing you ❤️
You are truly strong and wise Shyla. God bless you
May god continue to bless you and your daughter ✨🙏🏽
I hope you're here to stay 💕
We love you Shyla!!! Thank you for being YOU!! This was the most beautiful story I seen in a very long time. Your testimony will help millions🙏🏽🤍
YOU ARE THE MOST AMAZING AND STRONG WOMAN AND MOTHER ❤️
So excited for to see what this brand is 🔥😍
Thank you for sharing. Those who have gone through trauma know the pattern all too well - trying so hard to avoid it and somehow ending up in the same situations. You are helping so many by opening up. Much love 💗✨
I’m so proud of you for opening up it’s not essay but you got this you are so strong mama❤️
Can’t wait for chapter 2

we love you shyla keep following your dreams and never give up
I am with you on this! You are not alone and we are here cheering for you!   I'm struggling being in a relationship with my boyfriend. Never thought I would be with someone like him but my eyes opened after having my son. He's 3 years old now and I have lost myself in motherhood but I'm finally gonna focus on myself this and you inspire me to do that!! Go Shyla ❤️❤️
Yayyy proud of you for starting!! More vlogs by your own rules!!!!! ❤️❤️
love this, love you Shyla 🤍
Bullying is never okay. I can remember seeing all the hate comments towards you. I can’t imagine what you felt. But I’m so glad you overcame it! You’re doing an incredible job as a mother and human being. God bless

Sad how Shyla and her baby had to be bouncing house to house.. Instead of Landon securing that his Daughter had a place to call home. You will succeed Shyla.

Only half way through but wow! You can see and even feel the change and growth you’ve had. So proud of you to have overcome these obstacles and still continue to push through and shine 🤍
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ love you Shyla!!🙏
I love u girl I’m so proud of you for getting back up with your head held high fuck yeah !!!!
I root for anyone who gets back up. (edited: the timing of getting back up is different for EVERYONE) It is never easy. As a single mom, it's even harder. But GOD MAKES NO MISTAKES. period. The experiences we all encounter in our lives are the answers to creating the person we want to be. If you find yourself constantly questioning, "why is this happening to me...again"  reflect. what energy are you putting out? What energy are you letting in?  Shyla, I'm rooting for you. As a single mom to another single mom, I send so much love and encouragement. I'd want that when I had been through my storms and seasons of ups & downs. And I continue to hope for that as I raise my daughter and as I grow as a woman and a mama. One major thing that has helped me be more present, grateful, and positive is SETTING MY INTENTIONS for the day. Intentions are the energy you carry throughout your day to help navigate the day. Get it GIRL! Go after your heart's desires. Do what makes YOU happy and trust in God through the process. Set good intentions and the universe will match your energy.
Love youu !!
I love you I love you , you fucking go girl 😍😍🥰🥰 I can’t wait for you to succeed beyond you limit @shyla
You are strong. Keep faith in the lord 🙏🏽
You should never feel that you are only here for another human being. It all starts with you. If your not full filled and it relays on someone else you will never be whole.  You will never be happy nor will anyone else ever complete you. You is where it starts. From the inside out. Deep soul searching within you.  You are here for a reason not just for your child . Find yourself before anything else. Love peace and joy
Yes girrllll!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing but love 💜
Wow.. you are amazing!! Such an inspiring person.
Love you girl, keep going.  You really inspire me.  Sending you lots of love all the way from South Africa :-)
YES GIRLLLLL YESSSSS! Like always said your amazing and your here to do amazing things in life❤️

People comparing her are hella weird. She’s her own woman. Women don’t need to be constantly measured next to someone to show their worth.
So proud of you Shyla for turning your trauma around to serve your purpose!
Strong is a understatement! We are powerful mothers! So glad to see you grow thru all you have been through. You are helping so many woman out! Push thru mama, the ugly always tries to bring us down but we can overcome anything and will overcome everything! You go Shyla!!
It’s great to see you thriving Shyla! Prayers for all of God’s blessings and wonders to you and your whole family! Sorry for the losses in your life recently! 🙏🕊 You are on your way now, and you DO have a community that is rooting for you! Fix you eyes on God, and your mommy put it best: “follow your passion and it’ll lead you to your purpose”,. Lastly, close your eyes and ears to the negativity but allow your heart to receive all the love that is still out there! Truly excited for you and can’t wait to purchase some of your items!! 🙏💕✨💫🌟
We love you and support you 💯 in everything ❤️
We love you and stand with you shyla!!!! It’s your time to shine queen!!! Block out all the negativity!…………We all know shyla just gave horse teeth content for one video! Since he’s been clickbaiting every video he posts lol!

WOMEN ARE STRONG ❤️ two months ago my partner the father of my child beat me and i decided it was going to be the last I left with nothing but my son in my arms and ended at my parents doorstep no car no money no job i didn’t know what i was going to do i thought I was never going to do anything but you Shyla you have given me the strength to start from scratch and i know this is MY year ❤️ we are strong women if we are able to grow a human in us we are able to pick up the world with the tip of our fingers my journey started the moment I decided to leave and only god can tell me when it ends ❤️
OMG YES SOLAN MADE IT!!! I watched all his update videos on everything that happened btw u and Landon
This series is so genuine and vulnerable. We love to see it!
Gotta say I absolutely loved this video ✨ first one I watch completely since way back. You’re a bright shining star, Shyla and it shows from afar ✨ May God bless you and your beautiful daughter.

Ilysm Shyla, you’re so strong and I wish I could give you a hug. You’re an amazing mom and Souls so lucky to have you ❤️
We love you!!!!!!!!😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you shyla! Don’t listen to the hate. Ppl are bitter and they want to see you down they feed from that sh!t. Continue to show them that they  are ✨nothing✨ because you’ve been through so much worse. Show them how strong you are! I promise they’ll f!ck off and find someone else with a fragile state of mind to tear down.
Cannot wait for your journey and your new chapter. You’re amazing
You’re a force! Love you Shyla ❤️
You are such an inspiration! Only blessings from here don’t let anyone steal your shine! 🙏🏼❤️

Shyla I'm so proud of you! Thank you for sharing your story with the world 🌎 you're amazing!
And a lot of people in relationships they don’t realize they are in an abusive relationship until it gets bad or because you’re in the relationship for so long it’s your “normal” and your blind to abuse so it’s sad but I’m so happy you got out of it once your daughter was born

Just had a random thought, does anybody remember the video they did when she pranked Landon and said she was going out for lunch and was leaving souline with him and he literally forced her back in the room and wouldn’t allow her to leave???
you are strong. you are a great mother. 💜
Love you shy shy ….. you will be ok
You SMILED through sharing your trauma you handled this so gracefully and that is something no one can take from you ever. You are an inspiration, I am so sorry to hear about your sister I just know she is beaming over this. Good for you Shyla thank you for showing us how it's done
I'm glad that you've got yourself out of a relationship that wasn't good for you and your daughter.

So proud of you!!! It’s crazy how social media has made it okay for people to pass judgment and to now be able to see the ugly side of social media and what it can do to a person and to relationships (any relationship family friends, etc) but I’m not finished with the video but I’m already so happy to be watching and hearing you speak!! 💖
