Ill stick with my barefoot shoes lol
I ordered a pair after seeing the video - genuinely was expecting them to be £200 - incredible value for incredible quality!
Inspired already and only like 3 minutes in!
And you do bigger sizes so that’s great
yo my fault
Anti satan comment 667
Still clapped af mate.
6:50 they slap
NoTwoWays X Twodays… sounds good… one day
Be unrealistic
Those shoes are better than Nike  Love them  Keep going
Great video!
Damn Callux rich as hell
Shoes look like absolute shit.
Might be my favorite ntw design, if only i could have it 😢😋😂 from the Philippines in case you're wondering. Great job fellas, let me know if you ship here 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Shit as shoe
So you just made some Huaraches 😂
7:17 when do these drop
popular youtuber first helps
Black and purple would be a cold colourway
The lilac ones pale green ones and the baby pink ones are fire 🔥 as a female pastel colours are my go to x
make more i want them
how can I get a pair to ware in the states
Alternate title:how I went clear
He built an audience then launched a product.  Do it the other way 😅 then thats genius
nice
Which pub?
Be unrealistic
Accidentally... fucking muppet.
I reckon this is sponsored by shopify
Actually loved watching this 🎉🤯🔥🔥🔥
"if i can do it you can do it too" says the man with over 4 mil subs
What is with this cringe-ass intro.
Give Rocky a raise. Whatever he’s earning isn’t enough. As someone in business. He is going to be VERY important to you.
They’re ugly af personally wouldn’t wear imo
loved seeing this. Id look at getting someone to edit the content you already have and make your own show on youtube. This video was put together so well and professionally id like to see more.
Love this video seeing the brand go from an idea and  sketches to all them physical samples .. inspirational beyond believe 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥
would never wear the shoes but hope it goes well.
What exactly was the point in showing those ridiculous bets
SYZYGY black and white are my favourite
The ones you liked bro but i different colour way like a darker colour way would look well nice 👌 nice brand bro hopefully cop a pair of these soon
I only like high tops so these shoes won't be bought by me but it is insane you've gone this far
They are shite . Sorry 😂
I would 100% get any of those purple and black ones. They looked SICK!!!
You could make a full documentary of the whole proces and I would watch it for sure. Congrats Are these sold out?
These are absolutely sick.
Probably cost about 10 pounds to make
You don’t know how? Shilling your overpriced shoes to fans who only know you because of ksi bud
I want a wide base high top for pure comfort with great looks, bold colourway and sturdy, Id buy many as I use and abuse through pairs at work.
I need to buy one of your shoes and try them for myself
I'd buy it and rock it every day. Much needed for Dubai climate
If nike huarache had a baby with jordan 4
I just saw this today and i want one. So is there a chance that i can buy this and then shipped it to the Philippines.?
Proud of you, man. You've come a long way. Cheers.
I’ll come pub cal
those are ugly
after kanye died , there this guy who cook
So pre much have money, have a fashion graduate, make shoes.
Actually insane you built it to 26 million
Youtube relevance and fame + making a business is of course going to make money. Any sort of relevance plus a brand is going to blow up
this is such an amazing experience seeing the journey of how this is all done and been worked. also, that full yellow colourway on the wall is a need, i need them to drop that
really awesome vid, wow.
Brown with orange was fire…
Football boot coming soon?🤔
@Callux - Pls can I have some Foams ❤
Ugly trainers n i doubt many people buy em 😂
Definitely aint worth that 😂
The reverse syzygy would be fire Pls release those
Damn I still remember Rocky when he was in my high school back in the Netherlands. Always on top of the fashion game. So glad seeing how successful he is now! :D
hope rocky is getting PAID
Let´s get the Ice Blue ones
Wasn't an accident when you have spent the past 4 years doing it to make it work
Callux really has a genuine business mindset and he really grinds his way to the top to make it a reality.
Rocky is a GENIUS.
Will smith so stupid hahahhaha
Rocky is so cool to be partnered with. He is so open-minded and well nurtured in creativity.
So basically crocs, just cooler looking? Nice one Cal
Why? Shoes ugly tho.
just waiting for you to go global and sell your shoes at a physical location so I can buy lots of your shoes
congrats
So inspirational Fr
Suprised me, the shoes actually looks good and I would wear haha
I mean i don't want to hate but just because you say your business is valued at $26m doesn't actually mean its worth $26. For example even most of the sidemen don't wear your shoes in videos, people out on the street i have never seen a pair of ntw's. Must just be a london youth thing
Really not hard to do with influence and money is it
Do the shoes come with colouring pens so i can add my own colours?
Okay but why are we pretending like foams weren't something Kanye did already?
Not to be Debbie downer here guys, BUT Shopify sponsored this video because they know that during the gold rush it was the guys selling the shovels that got rich. Stay woke <3  Also, dont let that stop you, just realize it and plan better.
That process was incredible to see. Well done Lux for achieving it
I mean having JJ boost your brand didn’t hurt either
26 million 😂😂😂😂 those trainers are for 5 year old
Those purple and black High tops 👀👀
Lets be real. The business is a success because of the sidemen but congratulations on the success.
I really hopefully these shoes come to Australia soon because I passionate for these shoes my shoes size 12 or 11.5 and my favourite is Saphfire so Cal are going to bring these shoes Australia or not keep up the good work Cal I appreciate it for all the best From Major Yang
black and purple high tops
i remember watching you, syndicate and fearcrads going for moabs on mw3.. 6 hour stream. MOVES CAL MOVEEEES
So basically get yourself a fat bank account from YouTube and hire aload of foreigners to do the work you 😂
Here because of sidemen 💕 now more and more im liking calux hahaha
Damn, I’m in the mood for some notwoways!
I wanna see some hightops. The blue ones on the sample wall next to the sample Cal picked looked great.
Just from watching how much you put into this, it should be worth more than 26m imo. Congrats from the US!
Callux, nothing accidentally. U got sidemen and ksi money and invested it in something. Welcome to the millionaire / billionaire world, where anything you invest almost exponentionally grows because of the reach u guys have.
I feel like you guys need to make like a logo on the shoes like Nike has the Nike swoosh, Otherwise the shoes look like they're from a clothes store that doesn't have a real company for the shoes
Congrats Cal, but please don't sell dreams. NTW is a success not only because of the fans and Shopify. But also all those years building an audience, the connections you created (big ones like the Sidemen, that invested 7 figures in the company). So no, an average Joe won't create a million dollar company in a few years. You need to work on the marketing A LOT. That means having the right people investing, a good team, a good platform. If not you will end up with a mental breakdown and filling for bankruptcy. Business planning is very important before starting anything. If you have millionaire friends though, it does help a ton. lol
Cal… not sure if you’ve seen. But the adidas ozweego trainers have basically stolen your whole shoe! They clearly said copy no two ways but add some more squiggles 😂😂  Not sure if it’s close enough for a lawsuit… could be a nice billion or 3 tho if so haha!
Great, just leech off whatever’s popular. There’s no real innovation here
Loved watching this BTS video. Its so interesting to see the process involved from the initial idea to designing and producing a new product to sell. Mega congrats on the success of your business. Shows the power of youtube and your fans
Every shoe they highlighted is just "inspired" by a different company's sneakers... 5:46 - Asics 5:47 - Puma 5:59 - Jordan 2 (this one is funny how blatant it is) 8:05 NMD Foam Rnnrs with a Balenciaga Speeds in em
So you decided to copy Foam RNNRs?
Ahhh yes accidentally
Accidentally yeah. 🪖
Can we have a promo code for notwoways?
daamn would have bought but they are sold out
So basically just came back to YouTube because shopify
shopify: roguevillains (dot) com  Great to see the NTWs journey!
Imagine buying shoes off of someone who dresses like that
Love the brand but I bought those foams and they didn't fit well in any form 😂 the trainer's are super comfy though, waiting for my formulas to be delivered ❤
I am actually so jealous that I have only just seen this video and completely missed the release, hopefully one day soon youll drop some more foams. Keep what your doing with NTW its pure fire...
Love the fact that you highlight how talented the people around you are as well. So proud of you Callux, what a journey man.
Rocky is dutch??
you need to keep this type of content coming this is so good and new to watch its amazing
I love that this video shines a light on some of the people we dont get to see. I cant lie. Rocky might be the G.O.A.T of Design. 🔥 What a team u have. Keep it up!
dont teach birds how to fly having a fanbase is huge tailwind
The shoes are not my taste at all but I respect the grind and progression
All ive ever seen of callux is random footballvideos where he is absolutely dreadful, and everytime he pops in a sidemen video, had NO idea he's such a businessman and entrepreneur. I would never buy any of the shoes ive seen so far, but then again i see shoes as something to protect my little bitchfeet from gravel and thats about it. Couldnt care less what they look like. But KUDOS to the business, hope it explodes and by this time next year he has an update where there is a 0 behind the $26.
I would totally buy the purple black lows
Ain’t no accident Callux
I need that purple and black coloourway, that's wickeddd
Accidentally is a reach. Watching this is truly an inspiration to my own brand, love it!
26mil and can’t create an app and has to use a shopify payment 🤷🏻‍♂️
Bruv you need to start a YouTube series about how you started the company!
Release more foams man
no two ways can be worn three ways..
Am I tripping or is that a 2022 MacBook at 4:56? I thought these shots were from way back when you just started? Or am I tripping?
more of this almost like 'Sunday' with jesse from nelk
Theyre sick
Hair dryer trick phenomenal
Crazy what u can do with famous friends
Professional waffler
More !!!
NTW i kid you not are the only shoes i wear the quality is amazing and the value for money is insane.
still want a pair
Cal we need ntw golf shoes
Sooooo sick man!!!
Is Rocky dutch?
Some of the best projects start on a piece of paper ✌
still never seen anyone other than his mates wearing them.
Be unrealistic
I dont know why, but I was waiting for this video, Big up Cal, many more decades to go with n2ws
Please make a Chanel and upload you’re one doc. You would be the first one how really shows the bits of a business  like this
This guy deserves what he achieved he been through the wars with illness and been through some very low times callux you deserve this and the fact your showing people they can achieve there dreams with hard work fair play to you lad
Young JJ with young Callux
The hairdryer trick was mad
W team
i geniunley want a pair i'm in a wheelchair and i suffer with spasms and my shoes never stay on so i'll definitely try them
amazing stuff lux keep pushing
Love you Cal but they're sold out already in every size. Any way to make more available bc I would love to buy a pair?
Anyone know when those hightops are coming back in stock?
Sold out already 😂
damn they sold out could be making 50 mill lmfao
hopefully nike and adidas stay far away from this amazing brand.
Shoes are dead fam
My favourite shoe brand of all time. Literally hiked up mountains in them, flown in the sky in them and worn in every enviroment possible. I use them on film sets when I'm on my feet for 18+ hours and they keep me pain free. Cannot reccomend enough, big up NTW
Love it! Love the styles and colors I’m gonna be copping me some for sure my next shoe purchase
I don't comment often but these are my favourite type of videos and side of you to see Callux, thank you so much for letting us behind the scenes! It's super inspiring and really fascinating
singhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Bro the white and green ones look so good
Why is he acting like he didnt recieve 2.3 million in investment to start from his mates/sidemen and they have mentioned/advertised it and basicaly sold it for him
Even more impressive considering the shoes are ugly af
HMRC when he said it was valued at $6.23 on his tax return: 👁️👄👁️
“Small sneaker brand” worth 26ms my brother ur big time
First ive heard of tnw lol
Kaffir
Be unrealistic
Be unrealistic
fair play callux. you have a great team here. i hope they have decent equity.
crazy to see this from skill school to where he is now. Congrats cal mate keep smashing it.
The blue white and black hi tops next to callux fav is the ones I want most
Be unrealistic
Make a foam slide
I love these types if videos where we get to see how shoes are made and the brand expands❤
Interested to know how the 26m valuation has been calculated, the company reported a retained profit increase of just over £200k in 2023, and held total assets of about £3.6m. No denying it’s been a success but to say it’s worth £26m seems quite an overstatement, maybe a bit “unrealistic” if you will 😉
When are the foams back in stock they are fire fr you could also release some diff colour foams
i really want it, please sponsored me. i will do the marketing in my country. I'm from indonesia
So what part was accidentally 😂
I want them purple highs lol
I really love these kicks
Callux is the type of guy to accidentaly start a 24M$ shoe brand
More foams plz
not true , your shoes are one of the best looking shoes of all time . I love each and every design . I live in india so its a bit expensive but i was able to get 1 pair and its absolutely beautiful . Please keep working hard one day everyone can buy them
I love success stories ❤
omfggg elite, been watching you for years man and this is by far the best video you have ever put out. We need more content like this and I most definitely am copin this revolutionary sneakerrrr 🔥 respect bro
2 things Callux 1) I somehow already got my foams in the US and they look great, feel great, I love them. 2) How do i take them off my feet without the inserts coming out with my feet? (ps i tried dming ntwsupport on twitter but i couldn’t dm them because i’m not verified)
NTWxCHILDISH collab 🤔
Sold out again 😢. I want one. Incredible journey man
I hate foam  shoes but these I'd wear especially with the sock it's sick ...W shoe
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 Good job Lux.. Being unrealistic is paying off.
I really this type of content I would  love to see more of it callux
What's that model called?
not going to lie . ive never seen a pair
Just getting started … I’d love to see a notwoways x sdmn sneaker collab
I love the light purple color way
ive always rated lux so fair play man
cant wait to buy these bro
You’re just lucky u’re friends w the sidemen. Accidently lol u leech
Man I just made the most unrealistic bet on an American football game this morning, I took a shot in the dark just because, I mean you can't win big if you don't bet big
i love this video callux. soooo proud of you man. go higher and higher
THAT SMILE IN THE THUMBNAIL IS KILLING ME 🤣🤣🤣
The Black ones with the red strap is mad cool
W
I speak for everyone when I say the long time fans want to see more of this!
The sneaker really looks clean!🔥Need me a pair for sure
'be unrealistic' Wow, I'm incredibly proud of you, Callux. What a journey.
shoes look like shit! Congrats Lux, you the man!
My pleasure is your pleasure
I want a pair when the price of the brand is 135 mil
Toss us a mill cal and ill create a shoe brand using the 100k remaining after a quick casino trip
As an aspiring sneaker designer this was a really cool and inspiring video! Love what yous are doing keep smashing it
Be unrealistic
I can’t believe I missed out on the foams :( (TWICE)
Amazing video about the process! Excited for what is coming next!
i really loved this video as a fellow shoe lover. i wish i could get involved somehow
Thats crazy, with no hate or bad intent, I always thought Callux was on the poor side of youtubers, but cleary hes worth over 26 mill. Great job
Would be sick if you could have inserts (like a school rubber size in the insole of the shoe) that either kept you cool or warmed your feet. Perfect for an all year round shoe
Big up Rocky, bro is too good and seems like someone who is easy to work with!
so proud of you @callux
love calluxs monthly uploads!! 🥰
can't believe it's been years and this is the first time you've showed us some of the process haha absolutely mental to see how ntw just took off and never looked back. built an amazing team as well, so cool to see  the samples wall had some bangers in it, can't wait for what the future holds for ntw, keep smashing it 🚀
How much does cal do in comparison to rocky
be unrealistic
Shoes are not it imo, but love the bts scenes and the grind of ntw since day 1! Keep it up Cal and Rocky!
that fact that he's grown a 26 million pound business in 4 years just shows how much of a natural  businessman he is.
@Callux do you do size 15 notwoways?
Put more foams up
Fkn huge Callux you're a madman
Be unrealistic bro when’s the drop day
i need the pinks
callus i made an unreal bet like u said. i put luton to win the league i put 18,000 quid on it. thanks for the advice!!
banger of a vid
This is exactly why I invest so much time, effort and money into YouTube because as a foundation it opens doors to basically any industry you want dive into. ShoutOut Lux man💯 This is some inspiration sh!t
all needed is ntw logo
I recently begun making YouTube videos of my travels. Any advice on how I can improve them would mean a lot!
This kid wrote 'sneaker' in the title 💀
Rocky the brains, shopify the platform, Callux the money. Recipe for success…
Hard work pays off 👏🏻💎
👏🏻
ID on the north face jacket?
All the prototype designs in the background look so sick 🔥🔥🔥
Ntw is my favourite shoe brand. I love the fact that it’s a small CLEAN company. Decent prices with fantastic quality.
No hate but these are just the Jordan engineered foams that he literally shows at the start. Each the three ways you can wear it is the exact same, but they do look more fashionable tbf
More like how I ruined my 26 million dollar shoe company. Bro had so much momentum and the hype died
Was it accidentally? You literally said You invested 250k to start this business
Synthetic, sweaty trainers that will sit on a rubbish dump for hundreds of years.
Just looked at the site and the trainers look like Yeezy rip offs
I would love the foams in a black colour way
50£ shipping ☠️😭
Shopifys esports team changed my view on Shopify… they’re absolute legends
Simple and effective mkt move, I wanna buy that new pair
incredible
luckiest accident ever 😭
So Yeezys
Love this from you ❤,  just ordered a pair too. 🎉 I’d love to see more of this stuff, it’s really interesting and I’m excited to see where it goes 😊
You’ve smashed it! They’re sick man!
Netflix? You're making shoes lad, not fucking rockets
Not making btec merch is the way. Just a proper, good product. Unreal effort, man
Just launch something in Kenya to repay me Lux
Be unrealistic
Good Job mate!!! So holesome and so nice too see, you getting trough the process. :D
Love it Lux
I still think the shoes look preposterous, but they must be cool and it doesn't matter - Congrats on owning a 26 million dollar company!
The slides looked so dope
been wearing my foams as a house shoe and its just made me wish i was able to get a second pair as an outdoors shoe  for the samples, reverse syzygy bangs, the brown syzygy you’ve been wearing recently is near perfect and the green/yellow pair up1/right1 from the strappy design is my wildcard
really cool
Please make size 15 us i love the shoes and would love to support
so proud
very intrigued by the minty spring green colour that mixed with purple would look sick.
Be unrealistic
cal the goat
It's incredible all the prototype you have, some of them seems really nice. You have to release a Hi-Top now !
Bro sent me a sneaker to India 😅❤
Send me some lil bro😂
Very interesting. Congrats boys, smashing it.
SAKURA also the teal and lilac are 👌
Need more colours in the ARW’s banger shoe 🙌🏻
The slides were sick tho
7:12 “side hustle” mf id give my left arm to have a £26mil “side hustle”😂
I’ve got 12 pairs now and they truly are the best shoes I’ve owned
you could repay me with a job yk, did say be unrealistic 😅
If you make it to this comment, the last photo you show of the foams in there box finishes product, maybe make the black inlay sit higher round the edge so it looks like 1 peice, hides the green little badge makes the box look cheap just a thought
Can people from the us buy notwoways?
More videos like these❤❤❤
Amazing Job Cal! You’re an inspiration and the shoes look sick! I loved this video and would love to see more like this and more on NoTwoWays
be unrealistic
ntw x SDMN
my man rlly used a freestlye beat at min 2:15
I'm happy for ya dude but I still don't understand why people are so obsessed with shoes other than the hype
You should release a vote to make one of the unreleased designs a real thing
Seeing all this is really sick! All of those samples together look really great on the wall. Btw, I love the white and red one.
I’d love to have a pair however I never will because I’m in the us and I’m to broke for these lol but they are very nice cal proud of ya
your only 50 years old, its about time
Sick video, great to see the process
Insanely cool, seeing this journey is inspirational. Rocky is a genius, the perfect guy to be building this with. Good fucking job man
do more of these
Release them all
Crazy youve had 15 drops now, I remember trying to grab a pair from the second release and they all went instantly. Youve gone from strength to strength hope it continues!
naughty ways c:
Love❤
Just ordered a pair  Going to be repping them all the way in Canada 🇨🇦
be unrealistic
Seeing the high tops NTW are 😮‍💨😮‍💨 they need to be released!!!
fair play, great company. $26m is cap tho.
Accidentally is a stretch. You had a decent profile online already, and fampus friends, if you make a half decent brand and have others wear and show off your shoes you've got nothing accidental.
Love the look of the mint green ones. 😊
Dead shoes 😂
Nice design but the idea is too similar with Nike Clot Cortez
Andrew Tate would be proud🙌
Yoooo I would pay for one of these samples 💯 been watching from ages ago! I’m from Canada bro
my god that first clip jj is completely different
Hey @Callux, have you ever thought about Sponsoring any young athletes that absolutely love your Brand?
banger of a video
Who's cutting onions, what a goat
Sick man! Keep up the good work!
Ngl them kicks are horrid
Congratulations! Hope to see you continue to grow 🎊
5:56 please drop these bad boys please 🙏
congrats guys
be unrealistic
I guess that shoe looks cool if you’re a sneakerhead. Not my style, but I can see a lot of people loving it.
Stars aligned having rocky at your side 👏🏻
I just learnt that Callux cheated on his ex. Lost a lot of respect for somebody I used to watch everytime.
Unreal this is my dream to create a shoe 💯❤️
Huge congrats on all the success!!! ❤
Callum well fucking done man ❤
Please upload more videos like this and investing people do care even if it gets less views
what watch is rocky wearing?
Whats the full orange shoe
mate how do you calculate how much money your company is worth?
Please bring it to UAE
More
Pretty mental considering I've never seen a pair with my own eyes, but then again I've not been looking for them 😂. Fair play m8
Amazing to watch the growth of the brand. Exciting to see what's to come.
bro new thumbnail fast bro, I'm saying this for your sake
I wish you nothing but success, I don’t mean to be a hater, but most of these shoes are hideous to me. They look like clunky dad shoes
love the vid we need more of this
Just got a pair 👌
Not even 100K views after 16 hours… man’s fell off
God damn i mean i would get jealous but good for you i dont understand business  hope one day i will
Top work!!
Nice process! Not my style but glad to see the progression
At least 5 sexy pieces on that wall 🥶
Met Rocky a couple times and he is the best dude
wainting on the skinnier "girl" versions of fomesss
NTW golf shoes would be sick. Just imagine a more formal shoe on the golf course, but still something unique design wise. Waterproof and durable for the course. I would buy those
Congrats Callux absolute legend of the game keep proving people wrong!
lol how am I the first and third pic at 1:22 haha love you callux keep growing!
I would wear that everywhere❤
Super proud of you & your team
Tried to get a pair but couldn’t because I live in South Africa and for some reason it’s an issue lol. But loving seeing the brand grow
Rocky is really good
No two ways football boots coming soon? 👀
Definitely think a next step is boxing/ring boots. Nike, Adidas and Asics have tried but no one has perfected it. I used to be a pro Wrestler and used boxing training boots to wrestle in. Addidas were the best but they offered nothing in terms of comfort and flex. We used to wear them for 5 hour stints and the blisters were ridiculous.
Just copped there pretty cold i can’t wait for these to replace my grandads old crocks
kinda helps when you have a 4 mill channel to promote it aswell
You should trademark this design
I love these types of videos showing behind the scenes of businesses
Fair play tbh but them shoes are fkn vile🤦🤣
PLEASE RELEASE HIGH TOPS ON NTW, I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER, THE SAMPLES I SAW WERE SICK
I BEG to have a RED shoe from NTW! Hook me up with that sample colour way and ill do a promo of it
“Be Unrealistic”
I love seeing YouTubers create a brand that goes massive 👌
Shoes are ugly tho love Callux tho
Stop the cap
be unrealistic
Them purple high tops look quality
Accidentally already had millions of followers to se these shoes too as well didn’t you 🤔🤷🏼‍♂️
NEED the full purple ones
Wouldnt wear any pair of these if they were the only footwear on the planet.
Love the purple and black Hi top
It’s odd that in the shop it’s a max of two pair when shipping to Australia.. If I add a third pair of sneakers they won’t ship them. Guess I’ll have to place two orders.
Just copped, love cal ❤
the black and purple goes so hard
pink pink pink
10 Mill subs and all of us go to a pub in London!!!
Amazing  what you've done im younger taken a small shop camberley called franks doggs hope for the same success
Big ups
Those Kakis, hands down the best shoes i've ever had. Survived and still wearing them after a long walking trip around japan.   Congrats on all the hard work.
Let's face it the shoe brand would have flopped hard if callux wasn't famous
Hello from the US! I bought a pair of notwoways a few months ago and absolutely love them :) My friends always ask where I got them from because they love the look as well. Keep doing your thing bro!
Cal wanna send us a pair😂❤❤🎉
Atleast the business is doing well because Christ this channel is dead 💀
Are they all foam shoes? I like some but not if they foam. Got normal shoes
i want some ntw stock how do i acquire those??
it's not just because of callux's fame, the shoe itself is an artwork with functional usage. Havent had a chance to buy it *broke* but big up NTW
Gave me proper virgil abloh vibes, appreciate the insight lux love you <3
Love watching these stories. I think being unrealistic is so much harder than it sounds because it’s easy to get caught in your own head!
Hardwork and passion are never accidental, Cal you have done an amazing job.
You are an inspiration man..<3
Callux bro, this is the craziest fall off on YT, 60k views in 12 hrs fucking hell
proud owner of every GR from notwoways<3
BE UNREALISTIC 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 😊
Rocky 🐐
Let a fan design a shoe ..   You won’t.
❤
Idk how people say they accidentally created a brand/company/shit as if they tripped and fell into a hole and found a brand/company/shit...
Quite simple rather you promoted designs as limited edition then brought them back 😂 I stopped buying after that because I don't do false advertising.
Absolutely love watching NTW development!!
Cop’d the foams. Hopefully they arrive.(US)
0:20 wait when did Callux meet ricegum?
I think i heard the mention of some slides in there. I'd totally buy myself a pair of slides from NTW.
when are they gonna be in stores?
More behind the scenes of NTW is needed, video was beyond sick <3
youre so crazy brother, i love you loads and forever will be very proud
Damn give me a job I’ll drop everything
Stealing Nike designs and having famous friends to give you free advert. There. Saved you all a video.
The dark green ones behind your shoulder at 6:49 are 😍  So happy to see you shining and hearing an influencer speak so passionately about their brand
i would love to customize a pair of these
I love a Callux upload, they’re always so interesting to watch.
loved this
Congratulations!!!! You and your team deserve the recognition!!!
This is a banger video! You got an awesome team Lad
That pub will be making bank
Just ordered a pair, these are incredible. Well done lux, deserve everything you get from these
be unrealistic
05:29 3rd colum 3rd line those white brown first model
NGL really am looking at getting a pair of kaki
Seeing clips of the old vids and street interviews takes me back. Callux is such an OG in this yt game, always jokes
You got lucky tbf 😂 if you wasn’t where you was with the people around you then it wouldn’t happen!
Them green and black ones go hard 😮‍💨🔥
Shout outs to Rocky - what a legend
Sustainability ❤
Wish I could of got a pair... the amount of time most of these sneakers to sell out is crazyyy !  Very very happy I got the 2 exclusives, Formula + Roxo (Your team helped me get the Roxo, that I thought you didn't actually have any left, but they came in clutch + managed to send me an invoice with the sneaker ready for me to buy.. I almost cried when I opened the box hehe)  But my babies are kept in their box, have the paper to keep them straight..   Very very proud of you Luxyboo ! I've been here from the first babies getting released + you guys launched with the trailer etc, the new ones upcoming look stunning btw (Java colourway look stunning) So happy I met Rocky, he's goated !
Need like an adidas gazelle shoe for the football hooligans
I want the baby blue ones!!!!!
Insanity. So blessed to be a part of the journey.
very awesome to see, can you make a wide foot shoe?
Please bring back sapphires, it's my dream shoe, I'd buy 10 😩
Congratulations Callux... What is the chance with all of the releases thus far you did a giveaway to 1 lucky fan 1 pair of each one?  That could be an awesome way to give back as many of us would love to collect the full set.
"Accidentally" [Puts it in every video that gets millions of views]
Well done callux that new shoe is sick
The Sakuras! 🥲
absolutely love the brand brother, definitely need to cop me a pair in the future!
Rookie numbers PRIME is worth 10 billion ICANT (joking btw) Wish u the best cal <3
Don’t know what I think about the fancy crocs. Not that easy to just slip in and go, probably easy to get chafing in then aswell🤷‍♂️
The shoes are fire so please release it in other colors cause white gets dirty so quickly!!!
bruhhhh drop the purpleeeeeeeeeee!!!!!
Geez a brown pair for autumn!!!
Puma rip off
WHO ARE BUYING THESE
Proud of you
This is so beautiful to see & shows that we make our own reality. Great storytelling as per
What a trash title
Brings a whole new meaning to “no two ways”
I remember MrsBlackOps days from back in 2011 lol. When you used to stream Chatroulette and Cod zombies in your old Uni dorm. Happy for you mate.
It would be cool to see how the company started, from the very beginning. Give us with no experience of building a business an insight in to what it's really like
Bro remembered his YouTube password finally!
The new release looks so dope 🙌🏼👏🏼🙌🏼 be unrealistic
What does notwoways mean
You make it look so easy to make a successful shoe company
black foams pleeaase
those purple and black ones are beautiful
be unrealistic. such an inspiring video!! we needed this! beyond proud of you!!
Notwoways to Bijenkorf confirmed?!👀🇳🇱
Green and white ones are clean
Rocky seems like the best partner to work with, both him and cal make an insanely wholesome and entertaining pair
Honestly blown away by how good NtW is. Class product in a very tough market. Congrats pal
Congrats man. Im not sure if they are available here in NZ but if they are, I will go out and get a pair.
A NTW x Represent Collab would be dope
Does a video saying the company’s worth $26million, only uploads it because it’s sponsored 😂😂
The blue colour ways was 🔥🔥🔥
The quality of NTW makes it a no brainer tbh...
Good advice for kids lux, “make unrealistic bets, do it again and again!* Cmon bud 🙈
The brown ones to the left of the TV need to come to life
That’s such a fire design bro love the fact you considered options for the sock but I personally love the sock look
Bro openly admitted that magnets cost more than it costs to make his shoes 💀
Love the shoes Callum, I’ve bought loads of pairs and will buy more in the future for sure.
Do ntw football cleets
Do ntw soccer cleets
Love this from you ❤,  just ordered a pair too. 🎉 I’d love to see more of this stuff, it’s really interesting and I’m excited to see where it goes 😊
well done callum you've absolutely smashed it and the notwoways brand and whole team are amazing cant wait to see what else you guys come up with
Let’s gooo Callux keep going with notwoways and keep up the banger vids too 🤝👍✅💯
Only $26m ? Thought it was much more
I loved these shoes but I just couldn’t get away with the sizing but all in all great brand I have a pair of subsolars and the tag at the back is a lifesaver 😍
Your work ethic is incredible Lux
That first design reminds me of the reebok classic but chunkier
Need those purple high tops in an American 17
Callux killing it
4m at the pub? Christ that’s a big round
Was NTW as much of an accident as posting this video 2 hours after the Sidemen Sunday was posted😂😂
Callux a genius
I recently entered a competition (which I didn’t win) for a brand to design a colour way and pattern for a shoe. In the theme of being unrealistic I would like to send it to you with the hope of implementing the design on one of your shoes. It is very intricate and I’m not sure if it’s even possible… but in my opinion it would be one of the best looking shoes out there.   I don’t want anything from this I just want to be a part of the journey.   Much love king ❤ lemme know if I can help
Much love and support to you Callux. Be unrealistic
Congrats Callux!!
The green and white that Rocky pointed out «for the audience», needs to be released! Plus aditional colorways👏🏽
Congratulations Callux
Give ur N2W channel, thnx
I love seeing the behind the scenes of making the shoes. You should definitely release more of these.
Unreal vid. Need more of these
dont know if anyone will have the answer for this, but rockys watch is so cool, anyone know what brand it is? loved this video tho damn so sick!!
❤️‍🔥🙏🏼
Watching people being passionate about their work is so good.  Well done lad
Ntw is my favourite brand, just wish drops happened more often
The orange & black ones I'll be looking out for, big up your team here honestly 👊🏽
The fact went out the way to do something different to other youtubers and have built a fully fledged company is unreal. Would love to see more videos lile this the prototypes look mad and still love fact innovating in a very hard industrie. The foams are great and would love to see more. Shame I'm the only person in the world with two left insoles 😂
Fair play on the achievement but, those trainers are whack IMO. I guess it’s all about taste.
Dollars ? You’re British mate
I would tune into a full NTW Archives to today series. Every time
A dream come true, congrats
Gotta respect it 👏🏽👏🏽 damn
This BTS is sick - Seeing the process and how well you trust in Rocky's and the team's skills is very inspiring. Absolutely smashing it with NTW - love my afterdark's.
Good job Cal, hope some day I'll buy myself a pair of NTW. Keep going you are doing great!
you have a phenomenal talented team right there, i hope you're paying them well
New name: all 3 ways
Be unrealistic !!
That 26 million would go pretty quickly meeting 4 million people in a pub lol
be unrealistic
they aight
Cal is the 🐐
Just copped my 3rd pair of NTW :)
My fucking GOAT 🐐
This man is a legend and he done good for himself keep it up I will never get there in life but can I have some free shoes?
So how did they get on the 26 Mil evaluation?
some of those samples defo need to be released. Personally, i'm a big fan of the formula shoes the quality is mad for the price, Ive vouched that ill buy all the colourways you release in them. I already need another pair of the whites so keeping my fingers crossed for another restock
So this south east asian dude does everything and you just sit and scrutinize. Cool work. 👍🏻👍🏻
Great insight - drop another release of formula in exuberance
Found this proper interesting, its brilliant to see the journey designers go on 🔥
Huge congrats, you really deserve it🤝❤️
be unrealistic ☺
Definitely not by accident. You’ve put a lot of work into a successful business and deserve the applause you’re getting. Love this kind of video content.  Please do a rerelease of the original exuberance 🔥
I just don't like shoes. I wouldn't wear any of these shoes I only wear boots
Be unrealistic
Congrats mate. You've put in some graft to get here and the shoes look class. Proud of ya
26m brand but only ever seen YouTube people wear it 🥴🥴🥴
I highly doubt it’s worth 26mil let alone 3mill.
Good video, but you should be ashamed of encouraging a young audience to make bets
Trainers* we don’t call them sneakers in the uk mate😂stop pandering to the American audience😂
This is amazing
I liked my own comment
it’s so sick to see how far lux has come, I went from watching him an his mates fucking around to now watching a video on his 26 mil dollar shoe brand. good job lux 💕
I would sell it immediately for 26mill and then you never have to think about anything just chill
Haven’t watched a Callux vid in years, insanely happy to see that he’s still dropping videos and making insane projects
FÌRŠT
big W!! Congrats Cal!!
be unrealistic
No two ways about it Callux.
the fact this man created a brand like notwoways from literally 0 and documented the journey is insane 🤩
I hope to make it soon with a clothing/shoe brand the title alone motivated the heck out of me
Lucky lucky man good luck bro
Anyone else early and don’t know what to say
first
Insane accomplishment. Well done !!!!!
1st
sick vid bro congrats
I can’t believe I’m first😜
Callux with another banger!!!
give me free notwoways or i retire
No one asked mate
