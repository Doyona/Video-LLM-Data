People dont understand a man that is NOT educated in his own purpose that be the knowledge of FOUNDING and has to do with math science and literature and than has to be applied to his life by becoming a worker ant for any man that doesn't not know this is a WASTE OF LIFE and this is not me talking this is the laws of nature talking through me and all of you socalled "men" are little boy's and for any man that adds to the foundation of another man in general and his works not be fruitful that man is even lower then a boy and at this point you are OBVIOUSLY a WEAK LINK meaning the forces of EVIL may eventually consume you entirely if they havent already meaning you have to die because you are the devils puppet and only wish to take from the worthy meaning THE LIVING for you are the walking dead and dont deserve ANYTHING but DEATH and this is what the bible means referring to he who does not work does not EAT but i am woke i can swollow the WORDS OF THE MOST HIGH LORD WITH EASE AND GRACE peasants

Hardest song on the tape
“I never knew tears what it cost”. This song is about the rise to fame and fortune. The title called “what it cost”, and the first thing he talks about is the death of grandfather. His homies killed his grandfather and he got famous instantly. Pay attention
He said he came from rags but.. it looks like he don’t know what rags really is. Bc his before videos are my riches.
Goes in hard ,been underrated from ‘reminiscing’
I shed some pain tears to this

You should listen the person who is Demash's  idol and inspiration. Lara Fabian is the most emotional storytelling and best singer in the world. Listen to her song " Ju Sui Malamade" but you  better have a box of tissues with you when you listen to her. She had inspired so many singers and her talent was sent by God

This The ☝🏼 Right Here Family ✍🏼💯
Please read this entire post carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
🐐❤️
He snapped on this 💯🔥
I. Can. Not.  Wait for the album.
just for the intro it deserves a like
"So everyday I wake up with a chip on my shoulder,Like damn" I felt that in my soul ..stay real Big T

Why all rappers sound the same? About 10 new songs dropped this week and all of them sound alike again.. When is Hip-hip and rap going to change. Most of these “rappers” haven’t even lived on this Earth long enough to say they been through a thing. Keep it up labels

A boy asked a girl in a library: "Do you mind if I sit next to you"? The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! Everyone in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what the man is thinking, I suppose you felt ashamed, right? The boy answered out loud: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ... 🤭 If you like the comment, please "write" on my channel ...

When you can relate to every lyric it hits Home 😥
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Roddy Ricch fans heard that line from "die young" in his verse.
I love you with everything in me & more 🤍🤍 please don’t stop doing what you do!!
Sub to me plz
song is good. toosii strikes me as narcissistic, though. I understand just how challenging his life may have been, but his response to fame (which in many ways is a predicate of trends and social media) is: "I am special," not: "I am extremely fortunate to be in a position to help my family." I do not fw that message. Song is good, message seems misguided, forced, and weird.
@Toosii  yo video hard
nah this shit dump od
The universe will let you know if you awake!!

DO YOU REALLY LOVE JESUS? Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.John 14:23-24 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him Hebrews 5:9 If you truly love the Lord, you will walk in obedience to him. Our obedience doesn’t save us but it proves to the Lord we love him. Jesus says if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed (John 8:31) so we have to follow the Lord and walk in obedience to him. Can someone who doesn’t love Jesus go to heaven? Obviously not, we probably to Jesus we love him through our obedience (John 14:15)

Toughest singing rapper
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

My new shit > this new shit
10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I took an IQ test and the results were negative.  2. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.  3. We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse.  4. IRS: We've got what it takes to take what you have got. 5. 42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot. 6. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 7. The word "gullible" isn't in the dictionary. 8. Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time. 9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.  Editorial:Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.

I’m 1:24 seconds in and had to pause so I could take the time to write this. When that first tear dropped, my heart wrenched 😢 fs Idek you yet, but you got this! I’m on my second try of college at 27-Ima be a teacher 👩🏽‍🏫. Went from being homeless, sharing 1 cup ramen or some soup with my old cat, Mao Mao, to buying my first new car 4 years later. It’s all about passion & faith. God has a plan for all of us. & We must shine our own light when we feel as if we aren’t in the spotlight.  I hope someone take the time to read this (with no hate) and I want them to know everyone is loved, has potential, and must recognize that yes, their place in the world is so far from perfect, but it’s yours, man. Not a lot of people got that. When one flaw takes away or is lost, another ability will strengthen and flourish from the diminishing.   Love y’all bunches o’ mocha and vanilla oats. 🥰🥸🤞🏼
so underrated , you gone be REAL BIG ONE DAY they sleeping on you now . keep goin up GOAT STATUS🖤🐐.

Toosii literally pushes me to the fullest I never knew Toosii but as soon as I started listening to him I've never stopped God has a purpose for everybody in this life💯
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)…
I feel him on that
Remember tossie u chocolate drop God walks with you my love u got this love always
Ima keep it a bucc this song spoke to me harder then any other song, I feel him about his grandad thats what made me change. You a real one for real yo rise is finna be a great one. Keep it up you becoming a Legend.
This song is fire, this gives me  lil baby vibe  Toosii needs lil baby on this
I so relate to what u were saying about u and ur granddad. U wonder what it’s about u is so special is because u r a treasure. Reason I say that cause I was asking God same thing. His answer was u r treasure that every one will want be around. Has for u and granddad my grandparents were my heroes and who guided me. What u r doing is very honorable to em and to God. Song definitely will help many and also relate. Very inspiring song I love it 💕

HI EVERYONE HERE, I NEED SOME INSPIRATION PLEASE HELP ME TO IMPROVE MY VIDEO CONTENT, ANY ADIVCE OR SUGGESTION PLEASE COMMENT BELOW THE VIDEO: https://youtu.be/0f4s9RKwpIE
Me: To 2x i hope you read this, beginning of video was not a movie not gram but a real a really real part of yo life. Check it alot people go be like I understand and you should do this or feel that. So peep when I was 6months my pops died in car accident, so for everybody that lost: Brother, Sister, Mom or G parents, you get 10 years with them 20 years or even 1 hour if you old enough to comprehend you talking or hug them, so not just to you 2x but to everyone cherish that 10 year 20 year or hour those are great memories and when somebody is gone thats all you have left but me I have none not a second nor minute no day or year so imagine never remembering or knowing nothing he passed when I was 6 months i have nothing no memories
John 3:16-17 16.For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Bless this man.💗🙏🏻
