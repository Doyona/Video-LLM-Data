The nights are thrashing the bulldogs
That forward pack looks dangerous. Please find a number 6 for Pearce.
Thanks for the payout, try in the first 5 minutes much prefer to get paid out with wins go Doggies.
easy win for the novacastrians.

LOL its like old made knocked him out at the end

03:48 😬🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
terrible reads from dogs still building i guess
You can't give the opposition repeat sets and not expect points put on ya.They can only improve from this
Lob sided set re starts and errors killed the dogs.
Canterbury-Bankstown conceded some soft tries.
Congratulation to team Nights .Also to team Bulldogs
Connor watson us a gun
another disappointing season incoming for my bulldogs :(
Canterbury didn’t receive a penalty all game. They received only 3 set-restarts in the last 20min. Compare that to Newcastle who received 10 re-starts and three penalties.. the game corrupt to the core!!
If the dogs come last this year I will no longer be a bulldogs supporter
What a try save
That dude slid 15 metres easy with that first try 😂😂
So the Knights make a statement with their forwards. This creates a great environment for Ponga.
So jealous of you lot being able to go to a stadium and watch a match like normal 😢
Connor had a blinder
Lets go new
Conor watson. Wow
Plz stop putting the victors on the thumbnail
The referee's eyes were painted on. Doggies should have won
up up and away
up ya mum
Up the Warriors
