The first lady (the worker) decided to call her boss yet she could simply keep all the money for her self without the boss knowing. Her heart is so pure.
content creator like him do this as an investiment to make more bucks. I admit this Is a win to win situation, but ethically its a little arguable
Did the first lady, the one in the blue apron get any of that?

Just so you know, 10K Mexican pesos is 500 USD, and putting a dollar sign is wrong and it is just to trick you. Of course, it is still a lot, but it 1/20th of what he acts like it is
"Money doesn't buy you happiness".  Me: Oh, shut up
These videos just make my day
Where’s my money ? Have I been scammed
Sadly in Mexico, more than 60% goes to Cartel. The boss she speaks of is the cartel enforcer that holds that area.  So, basically over 60% went to Cartel to make fentanyl and other drugs.  I don't mean to take wind from your sails, but I had conversations with people like her, and those ladies on the beach that give massages, give away 75% to the cartel.
They were like I don't understand kindness
These are real people not these fake ass take and gimmes that America is filled with
Good.
😮😮😮❤❤❤❤
Hopefully boss split it with the worker actually out there
Aww this is so kind anyway where my 10,000
Qué Dios te bendiga

I was in Mexico and I went too hotel I didn’t know it was a scam cuz it was my first time the food in total was 280 in Mexico pesos like USA would be 25 or 50 but they knew we was from USA so they said 150 and we ordered food again and mf raIsed it too 180
Ain’t no way some food was $25 pesos
Tan dulce y genuino el pueblo Mexicano...
it didnt put smile on my face, it did cringe
Thanks for helping my people out.♥️♥️
Why don't you improve the standard of living for all those people instead of randomly giving away your excess cash in order to gain views in YouTube!?
10k pesos its almost $500 us. Relax
I hope she gets the money
You have to give to receive and if you haven't received anything yet keep giving 💯
Nooo u shoulda only told the lady ot sad to say my own people try to take advantage of other people sometimes u cant tell everyone
This is proof that money can buy happiness
Looks like a different lady
U understand she only get 7000.only and if she's sell rest more money the boss keep 3000.
Amén 🙏🏻❤️🙌🏻
si hahaha
Again I call BULLSHIT
She’s called the boss to tell her how much she got for free now he’s gonna take it
What about the girl who was cashing him out
U should of said ITS NOT FOR UR BOSS its for you if she gave that to her boss most likely she didnt get all 10k
I would tell him to get tf out. It is not charity place.
Keep it up jimmy bless your soul …. 🙏
Gracias  mdmovitador
If you're going to ask comments to the videos, make sure you know Spanish or whatever your translating she said. $0.25 not $25 each stop making it look like she's overcharging people. She's not
🥹🥹🥹
This is the type of people that are successful
I don't smile I hate my teeth
Do this in your own country bumb

I didn't smile so I'll be waiting for my 10k 😐
Pero ese afán porque el mundo vea sus “buenos sentimientos “ , cuando se hace algo como eso se hace sin exponerlo al mundo , pero bueno, sigan “ con sus buenos sentimientos de ayudar ala gente ,,, pero con camaras para que el mundo vea “ lo bueno que es “ 😒😒
BLESS Her HEART She's so Sweet 🙏🏿👋🏿❤️
I love seeing acts of kindness.... Love covers over a multitude of sins
Didn't smile , now give me the money
My people are so cute when they translate
Hope her husband gets better
Literally didn't smile once where is my 10 K
Check all his videos all same people he is helping is working for him the lady that cover her face and translating and the man too so don’t believe what you see on here stop talking advantage of people
Worker deserves more than owner, always
Okay so you gave all the money to the boss instead of her🤦🏽‍♂️ wow I guess everyone else miss that
Your videos keep me going
Where my 10k at? I want my money
Nice heartfelt video, but I believe cinquenta is 50
This is the guy I see doing this truly out of the kindness of his heart.
You make me cry and I like it and hate it.
Sounds like alot, till you realize its only 500$
Man i love this😄
Where's my money
Fork over the cash
Y literal las señoras piensan esta bien wey por comprar todo jaja
How to get people robbed
He's only taking 1 and leaving the rest for her to sell, maybe she would have been happy to knock off early that day..
I really appreciate videos like this because people around need to know how diffent it is in other countries appreciate your freedom's  not everyone has the same ones
I didn’t smile soooo pls message me for further instructions
No angel, he’s nice but he’s doing it to make a profit, 10k is nothing by comparison to how much he’s already made it with his views and 1.2 million likes
I like ur videos and hope u bless more people by giving them...hope u would come and bless my country here in phillipines...Godbless
I don’t think it went to her
I get so tired of the negativity from the media, hate from people, and discontent world wide. I get tired of the wars and the violence and the gangs and the crime. I get so so tired from life. It is sooo nice to see people like you who reach out in kindness to others instead of hurting others. Thank you for reminding me life is worth living
She’s taking care of her business and husband
I love you all❣️
He needs to put pasos not dollars he didn't give $10000 he gave 10000 pasoss
$1.22 (25 pesos) bruh that’s fucking cheap
I didn't smile where's my 10k.
Where my money at
Ahhh imagine all the drugs ahe can buy now
So did the first woman get anything?
Some of these people pay taxes to the cartels.... they're not bad people but it's their job to notify them. Don't be surprised if your YouTube ventures come to an end someday... I'm sure your a nice person but they're going to say, "Pinche Vato payaso, se lo llevo la chingada"
Video: 10000 pesos Me: GOOGLE - HOW MUCH IS 10000 Pesos in USD 😲
So, she's either a shape shifter or he instead gave her boss the 10,000 pesos? 🧐 🤔
La jefa bien lista, el dinero era para la empleada no para ella
This causes inflation!
Aye man my respect goes out to you🦾🦾🦾✊ this made me shed a tear keep what doin what u doin this is beautiful fr
You owe me 10K
You owe me $10,000. now you know how unhappy I am
I love this man. I love how he blesses everyone
This made my heart smile🥰
I want my $10,000 since I didn’t smile
I love their reactions
To those who aren't aware, $10,000 Pesos Is a breathtaking amount in Mexico, especially to someone running a taco stand. Typically, Someone makes that money in a year, so while it might not seem like much, it's life saving money here in Mexico. God bless this man.
Everyone me To i give 5000 dollars to the Poor. Give me Praise
Dude her boss is the fking cartel, these people youre helping is kool but want you to know that ...youre putting their lives at risk walking around give them that much ... May not be much to you but people there hurt for less... &ill for nothing

I really don’t care if this guys is doing this for views or not, at the end of the day he’s still helping someone
IF WE WIN WE WILL GET 2,000 PESOS!
Damn appreciate you showing much love to my people real talk hard working class people not all of us are bad
This is well meaning, but so dangerous! There was so many people around observing she could’ve easily been mugged or her boss not given her the money.
Pay up ima a heartless monster
Gon get kidnapped real quick
May i ask why you use the dollar sign when talking about pesos?
I found it heartwarming, but i didn’t smile. Can I get 10k?
So sweet
YO CASHAPP ME LES GO, Where’s my $10,000!
This is awesome! I hope to one day have the money to do something like this
Comments: this is so great!  Me: Wait, what about the woman who was actually working!?
Praise GOD!
Me llena de orgullo ver a mexicanos hablar inglés, algo que no es muy común ♥️
dont forget to only give if you know you can get the money back from youtube. cause that's already what you're doing. just flexing to the poor for your own gain
Bout 500 right there baby.
He owes a $10,000 to me cause I didn’t smile
If you were truly altruistic, you would do it without the camera
My heart melted ❤️😭
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I did a mission in Guatemala once. Lemme tell you… those people… they had almost nothing.. but accommodated my whole church crew invited us to their lil bodega and made us food…  it was fucking crazy.. I remember they were all just so happy we came by and talked. We pooled our cash and ended up giving them like $250 in American. They refused and cried saying they didn’t need any money.. we ended up buying some artwork their daughter had made and slipped the money in while they weren’t looking… to see this remind me of that.. cause they were such kind people… it’s exactly why when I see people in a hurry or upset at a store or station I don’t say a word just lettem go ahead of me cause you never know what someone is going through
💙
God bless you man
I didnt smile now give me my 10,000
$486 US dollars can change someone’s situation drastically in another country.
Man I know these are like clout donations for views but these seem like they're really making somebody's whole life
Sad that he ended up giving the money to the boss and not the joyful worker we got to see
🧢
God bless you all 🙏
Awesome 👌🏽
How much profit?
Cincuenta means 15 not 25
I don’t Smile , give me my money bastard
She was so confused cause he was negotiating wrong
I got tears of joy when I saw this.
Bro where’s my 10 k like I don’t have emotions so no I didn’t smile
$10,000 isn’t 10,000 pesos. Idk why you lied
I like the fact that they can’t contemplate your offering. Cause it never happens before. Love this
❤️❤️❤️❤️
gimme my 10 grand please
Do it off camera
You owe me $10,000
❤️❤️❤️
Great video but... wheres my money
It didn’t make me smile you owe me $10000
In  life you will never lack anything in shaa Allah 🙏
177.58 usd is 10,000 Philippine peso
10,000 pesos is $100 dollars.
10,000 pesos =  $488.37   Ask me how I know that.
She better call some family members to walk her back to the house cause she’s gonna get jumped
10,000 pesos is 100$.
Where is my $10.000? HUH? 🤨
Dont tell the boss!!! Give him 2k and give her 8 dummy
10k peso is just under 500$ USD
How much is a dollar peso?  {:o:O:}
😭😭😭😭😭
You should of gave the money to the worker not the boss. Or half and half at least.
(That’s about $487 US dollars)
I’m in tears
Your husband is verry sick:) great video ❤️
Crazy how $450 usd goes in Mexico but people spend that in a second In the states
Latinos with MDMotivator 👍👍👍👍🤟🤟🤟🤟
But wouldn't her boss profit off this transaction? Not her?
The benefits of being a rich kid 😂😂😂😂
what’s the song ? 😭
Kindness is infectious and positive, why do people have so much hatred, we need to be happy with the little things and be happy and grateful everything we are given. I love people and the world I pray for every day. This is an act of random kindness, pulling those strings from the heart that everyone needs to see. Thankyou for spreading the kindness for everyone to see! Please ignore hatred and celebrate life as it is, beautiful, just like you! Think positive, be positive and positive things will happen! Put out that positive energy every day, no matter what, open a door, pay for someone's drink, and be respectful, Thankyou for listening!!!   Everyone enjoy your day!   👋😊❤😊👋  **Life is meant to be a struggle, every day a challenge, just remember positivity and those little moments that make us unique. Be a unique-YOU! Pass it on.      🙏👋❤👋🙏**   Think of it this way..today might be the day they need it most! ✌
Why didn’t the worker get the money!
Ahh youll make it back on your views in no time and other pages 😆
DIDN’T SMILE I HAVE NO SOUL HEHEH
❤️
Can I give you more than it's worth and put it on YouTube? Let's think about it
Your good DEEDS won't FORGIVE your BAD DEEDS only the SHED BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST.

Me living in Mexico waiting for that guy outside my house
💙💙💙💙
WHERE MY MONEY AT!!!!!!
Gracias
Where’s my $10,000
Easy flex for little money
I believe this is the better way. Instead of selling them out and leaving them with no supplies to continue working, they bought one item and a lot of money towards her sick husband.
Angel still belongs in this world 🌍
I hope her boss didnt try to pocket half the money
Healer’s high🫶🏽
She dead ☠️
This is his best video
Ablacım bu pesoları al bugün eve erken git olur mu? Ben sadece bu burritoyu istiyorum
Did she say sui at the DID SHE SAY SUI AT THE END ( u suiied a like from me)
Bro every guy is sick on this channel or something like the idea of fake vids starts going around in my mind
Where’s my $10.000 I didn’t smile
You underestimate how dead I am inside with the smiling bet 😐
I didn't smile so I want my 10 ,000$ please lol
Such hope for humanity, we need more people like you. Keep doing good thing bro.
♥️
$10 000 pesos where does the dollar sign come from
Love it ❤️
Nah I would of have some to the lady in the blue too her boss obviously still makes more than her smh they both should of got some but maybe they did who knows lol
Western saviour mentality never gets old, you don’t need to post something to do a good deed
🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
What an idiot. Instead of paying the worker who stands out there in the sun all day selling that merchandise.  You pay the lady who put her there to begin with exploiting her for scraps. And you already know there's no chance she cut any of that money to her worker, who seems like such a joy and a happy woman regardless of the circumstances.
So awsome
Why is everyone struggling with something when you give them money
You owe me 10k
This is cool but next time do it without posting it.
bro lets help everyone lots of love to all people
“Have a great day” Her- “si”
aweeee
Love her laugh 💕✌️
Well someone owes me 10,000 dollars
These videos are amazing. It makes me so happy to see that there are still good people in this world.
I’m crying
🙏🙏
10,000 Pesos is $488 USD… stfu
I didn’t smile where is my money ?
Fun fact:10,000 pesos is lower than 10,000$ if you make the 10,000$ turn into peso it will be bigger so that means its gonna be 20,000 pesos.
10,000pesos is $450 usd
Bello este hombre me gusta su humildad.
This is so patronising. If you want to donate to someone, just to it without this stupid act.
I need a blessing like this 🙏💯
Not before, not after..    God works in mysterious ways.      Some prayers are answered like we Need.    Or others Need.  ( in some cases ,not all )       not all prayers are answered of What you want.    Usually it's what you need.     And other times..       "Don't lose faith""!!      Life is borrowed.      Our birthdays are borrowed.    Yup.
Well now you own me 10,000$ i did not actually smile ;/
I think that this is how God works. Not in a sense that he is God but that to that woman, he is literally a gift from God. He didn’t know her husband was sick. That may have saved him. Weird to think about.
Do this to somebody in America so It can actually put a dent in your wallet.
And the workers don't get anything?
But she is the owner but what about the worker
Que paso
It is time 4 you to read the Quran
U are the man, keep giving lil happiness to big heart people who really need 👊👊
She said I don’t understand 😭
Jesus Christ is lord amen 🙏
Please never stop doing this!
That look at the end and the little “si”
Don’t let her bosses know 😔. Chances are the bosses are gonna take most or all of it and threaten her if she doesn’t give it. Pay the normal price and slip her the rest
🙏
😍😍😍😍😍
10k in Mexico is 1k American dollars in case anyone is wondering, roughly
She meant ankle
That's about 500 golden eagles for those womdering
Beautiful moments!
Dude does a random process everytime for 0 reason lmao and doesn't use any of the information from it
What city is this?
Is this in California or??
where my 10,000 😭
That was good and all but the money was being given to the worker at first then the boss came around she's the one that got the money I hope she gave some of that to the first Lady who was just a worker 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
100000 pesos is like at least 4 USD
Bro learn some spanish numbers lol. Cinquenta = 50
Cash, Please, I don't like big bills either.
Stop putting $ on pesos.
Thank you sir for helping my people. The racism we go through is overwhelming but you being so kind gives me hope
If the Bible says that we are all sinners ( Romans 3:23; 1 John 1:10); that our sins have separated us from God ( Isaiah 59:1-2); and that only Jesus Christ can reconcile sinful men to a holy God ( Romans 5:10; 2 Corinthians 5:18), then you see why it is that we urge you to repent of your sins, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved ( Acts 16:30-31).  Salvation cannot come through a church, for no church ever died for your sins. Salvation cannot come through your good deeds, for the Bible says that in God's sight there is none that doeth good ( Ecclesiastes 7:20; Isaiah 64:6). Salvation must come through Jesus Christ, for he did what no church, no religion, no pope or priest or preacher can do - He died FOR SINNERS, was buried, and rose again the third day ( 1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Only He can take away your sins ( 1 John 3:5; 1 John 1:7).  You can believe on Him and be saved today ( Romans 10:9-10). Otherwise, " how shall ye escape, if ye neglect so great Salvation?" ( Hebrews 2:3)   https://youtu.be/YiM7Bfu23_c
I didn’t smile wheres my money? (Just kidding have a good day)
This does not make me smile!!! Her “boss” is on his way to “collect”!!!
He gave it to the owner instead of the worker kinda off
Awesome
The problem is, that’s not her business and by the end of the day she requires to give that money to her boss. Her boss if he not greedy and it will allow her to keep the money but if yes he’s likely gonna take about 80% of the money. I know because my family has been doing this type of businesses for 98 years especially if you if she lives in Mexico or any Hispanic countries it’s totally like that. My family now own their restaurant and became their boss.  God bless that women . She in the video already stated she ask and called her boss. So hopefully he not an ass those jobs u don’t get paid by the hour but by sales how u sold and u get a % of the money per day by cash.
Next time don't film it.
What a guy
I didint smile so… where’s my $10,000
hey am Owens am gamer and I love gaming but I lack a console any who would help out would change everything for mi I don't mind if its old please 🙏❤

Bro can I travel the world with you to spread joy it’s amazing you are a miracle to people
FAITH ,HOPE ,LOVE , FOR I AM HE THAT HAS AWAKENED FROM WITHIN THANK YOU FATHER
Nice move, especially with the sad music. You bought her dignity. Think about it. — Give her a fish, great. Why not teach her to fish? Clearly you would not actually invest in her. Just throw money at her.
Nice man but where's my $10,000
Just seems like a waste of money to me idk 🤷‍♂️
God bless all with peace, love, health, safety, prosperity and protection!
About $500 USD
The boss: that’s mine
Common factor of all these is their ABUNDANT LAUGHTER.... God Bless
I told you see I'm not the only person who thinks it you are an angel
You lose. Please DM me.
The look of desparity and yet determination at the same time is nothing short of amazing. Good Mexican people are some of thee most beautiful people in the world.
Bendiciones, éxitos 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Should’ve gave it to the worker not the boss
You'd think after all these videos being in Hispanic countries, he'd learn some basic Spanish.   Oh well, who cares, man changing lives out here.
Money
❤️❤️❤️
Jak nie wiele potrzeba wydać żeby zrobić coś dobrego dla siebie i innych . A ludzie wolą wydać 10k na butelkę w klubie i wylac ja na ludzi ...
God bless you man.
Visit Puerto Vallarta Jalisco México 🇲🇽🙏 greetings from puerto Vallarta Jalisco México 🇲🇽✌️
I like these videos, but don’t really understand the point of making a video except to either enhance your brand, make money, etc. Something self-serving. Why not just do this and not make a video that’s shown to the world? Seems fairly exploitative
fkn beautiful man‼️keep up the blessings 💪🏾
Pesos is not $ xD
God bless
Dude i wana be like you
I don’t understand you?! Lol seriously an angel😇 love your videos
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love you man.
My respects for all the love and happiness you’re showing to people in need.. god bless you brother

These guys are the reason for hyperinflation in these countries.🤡   Just kidding, u got a big heart bro!
You’re the best!
Get well soon
Call her boss? Make sure to clarify to her that there is two payment. One for the food actually purchase and the second is whatever the difference is for her to keep and not for her boss. A good number of these workers don't own these portable stall, they work for someone else. A better future is to gift them a cart with their own startup 👍🔮😜
If hubbie is sick buy him his health!! Exit: If possible ofc.

So crazy how that’s so much money in Mexico, but only $500 here.
When you get to heaven and God says sorry we're fresh out of likes
She was suspiciously apathetic for receiving that much money for nothing. That's about 500$ US. It's not gonna save anyone from major medical bills, but that's a nice chunk of change to get from someone for doing nothing.
Didn't make me smile. You owe me.
now give me the promised 10k
It’s not $10,000 dollars buddy I know your trying to get views but 10,000 pesos is actually like $500 dollars so relax
Amm I do not understand why you use a dollar sign when its not a dollar
Hiding all her sorrow and pain she serves her customers with a smile. *Beautiful.*
Wait why is 500 blue in Philippines its yellow
Where’s my $10.000 I NEED DAH MONI-
I won pay me
No betting. You make me smile all the time.
So kind man
If I was terribly in debt I would do the same thing my whole life I've helped people now im stuck and no one can help but I love seeing humanity restored we need more people like this

Nice to see a English Youtuber go to Mexico👀
Connections made even with a language barrier, but as it seems you're spending a lot of time in Mexico, I think it'd be a good idea to brush up on some conversational Spanish!
To whoever reads this, your life matters. You are

What you are doing is special for the people you meet, and you are helping all of America when you are doing this. With all the things that are going on in America and the Criminals in DC who trying to destroy America from within and around the world 🌎🌍 😎 it's great to see someone who is showing what a true American is really about, and that the current administration is not what the American people are. 😎🌍🌎🌏😎👍🦅🗽🦅
That's awesome but I didn't cry now where's my money?
Does anybody know where he's getting the dough from? Like homeboy here is incredible but I'm concerned about y'know, spending hundreds of thousands

It didn’t make me laugh where my money?
thanks
This $ is dollars not pesos
its philipines i think cuz i am from philipines
Thank you for the way you make people smile
Boss probably took it
Her boss think:"Jackpot, i get 10000!"
Yes, she is hard working. But I don't understand why people think that selling things on the street, and by the way she's not selling homemade items she obviously said she has a boss, is more hard-working than any other job. It's weird. I think it's just like this bias that people have toward Mexican people.
👍
Takes so little to make a BIG difference!!!😁🙏☝🙏❤👍👍👍
Give me 10000 dollars i did not smile i just made a happy grin
I don’t like how people give for the views and give only to post it (not saying this what this guy is doing) but it don’t matter to me people post way worse stuff id rather it be that and get more people to give and it makes more people give because they want to record so no matter how it’s done I’m glad people are giving to the less fortunate
You better give me the 10000$ rn
Where’s my 10k hjk
Bruh we dont deserve this guy he's an angel giving everything he has to people god bless you man
What a beautiful Lady
Awee this is so precious! God sets your path before you
MDMotivator hug me bro. i need your love 😭😭 im so stressed and depressed, i feel so lonely. im always crying when im watching your videos😭.  i love you 💖
at first I thought that was Philippines 💀
Have a great day. Yeah
Pesos I hear?
❤❤❤❤
Those r real humans. Maybe they look poor but the have a heart of gold. In those first world countries the women would get the divorce because her man "cant feed the family" anymore. No woman here would give up her whole life just to get him through.
I hope her boss didn’t try to take all the money from her.
10000 Mexican pesos = about 500 United States Dollars
#med4all . .
God bless!! 🙏❤️
That saying: money is the root of all evil. It is not true look at how happy a person can make people by giving them money
Bruh gracias is that Spain or philippines
It’s 500$
God bless errybody
Love yah to brother
BULLSHIT ... This is stagged and fake
Always remember “kindness is a language that the dead can hear and the blind can see” -my dead grandparent

Your so generous for doing that . I hope her husband feels better . 😁🤩❤️🥺🙏🏼

May god bless that woman’s soul and thank him for sending an angel
Ah yes, every camera is now invisible.
“I bet you this will make you smile” me who is happy but has a mean resting face:
Yu knw it’s sad that the poor lady who I’m sure was the one who people wer referring to was the 1st one & im sure she also didn’t receive a penny out of that money but the owner got everything
What a way to spread happiness! Bless all of them 🙏🙏
Those women are tough women.

I really hope these aren't fake. I love these types of videos 😁😍🥰
10000 inn the bag 😈
I like people who just get on with it
The old stick a iPhone and in your face and do a “self-less nice thing” for nothing except the views/likes/ social media attention.
Fun fact, vendors in Mexico make more than the majority of professionals
Like an angel 😇

Awesome
Great person you are "Mey the force by which You"
see how much "social conditioning" affects our view of our personal world bubble we're constrained by.. their confusion says it all
u shut have given the money to the lady working not the owner she has money.  the lady working was the one that needs the help. u help someone that most likely has money not the worker..

This is wholesome and all. I encourage you to keep on. However, true acts of compassion aren’t recorded.
Sincuenta is 50, not 25
Wow. Now she gets chicken dinner for a week and you get a million views. Quite the slimey trend.
Is this the Philippines cuz the bills look like 1000 peso bill
Beautiful moment. Great man. 👍👍🇨🇦
This made me cry always be kind
Then the locals find out, stab her, and take all the cash. Probably better to do that transaction in private.
Why
Those look soo good ill pay 1 trillion for a bite
Philipinosss
The lady selling probably didn't get shit though the owners husband is the one thats sick not the lady's at the beginning
Pathetic

She was later abducted and murdered by the cartel for the money this is actually really sad and shows the white privelege of gringos  playing the white saviour role in Latinx countries
Actually not just America in Mexico to
You gave her ten thousand pesos that's only $477 and something cents at  America
You such a hero
We need people like this more in the world not NATO and the rest who want to kill people and get away with it…
We’re is my money

Brihh i taught your in philippines
I don’t think ppl understood this. The first woman called her boss over. The second short lady is the boss. She’s the one who got the money…. I rather the first one to have the money. She looks like she needs it more… being from Mexico I can just tell who is more financially stable then those who aren’t.
SHE IS CORRECT YOU ARE AN ANGEL !
Boss he only wanted 1.
Yes doesn’t believe you! 😊😊that laugh.
Give me the 10,000
$25 pesos? Tf?
Your videos are inspirational bro. I love it 👏👏🙌🤙
I’ve been on this earth for 48 years. I just had another birthday March 9th 2022. I see all of these people being blessed, and nice things happening for them. I do have faith I just can’t see my way it’s like it’s taking to long. I signed for a townhouse with Ryan Homes Red Hill Elkton MD. They pulled the house from me knowing where my credit was at the time. I could not believe that happen to me. I just want to get out of my sister’s house and do something for myself and my five children. I feel like I’m starting all over again it makes me feel like a failure. I will keep my faith in who Jesus is. I started out with a credit score of 492 I’m at 572 now. I’m great full I hope this finds you for support fatima.
Where's my 10,000
The sad thing today is why you need to film this that u help someone... Just do this without a video and be a good human....
Maybe it might be against your view but, maybe you shouldn't include people around her in the information you are giving her 10,000 pesos. I think there's a decent chance someone could jump her for it or manipulate her because they are all in the same situation. For her safety.  Unfortunately something to think about.
God Bless you bro
Where’s my $10,000
10000 peso is about $450
Where's my 10,000 grand I didn't smile bro
Beautiful people!!!🖤🖤🖤🖤🙏🙏🙏🙏
Wicked bro ‘
Monke love and approve
I wish you would’ve given it to her off-camera so she could pocket it all
I didn't smile please give me my 10,000 $
We’re is my 10k I didn’t smile
bro if u do something like， u dont have to make video and show everyone what u have done，sorry but ，its sht bro really ！
People are the same world wide, love for one another ❤️🙏
She said 50cents lol not 25 cent each one
It's good for us to be reminded that people all over the world are struggling and battling everyday.  You are not alone, even if you feel alone know that you are not.
May God bless your heart and generosity ❤️❤️❤️
Easy to do good deeds when everyone is watching.
Where my 10,000 sir.
Finally someone who gives money to people that ACTUALLY deserve it :)
The caption is not right pesos is not worth as much as dollar
I feel like they would clap you bro
❤️😢
25 pesos is like $1.25 or something. For anyone wondering.
Where my money at
We don't see this on the news because it's too positive.only negative things make the news
Lol the “thank you because her husband is so sick” just made me think “you’re supposed to give them the sad story BEFORE they give you money not AFTER” lol
Jesus loves u and died on the cross for our sins and he is our lord and savior....
are womens from the start and from the end of the video same womens
Lived in Florida my whole life very heavy Spanish and I loved it some of the most hardest working people I’ve ever met with a smile on there face and they will allways have ur back Mexicans make America great tbh truly do love my Mexican people

Awwwh
U did not make me smile but u made me happy inside my heart😁
Lawl, pocket the 10k and don’t call your boss.
Love your videos man, spread the love!
He is the REAL lifesaver
La juarez!... Hooo si Riviera Maya:
The wrong lady got the money… wtf
I wish to be in this position one day.
❤
Love brotha!! 🙏
GOD BLESS this man!!! 🙌🙌🙌
Bru these are the people I want to see seeing this makes me happy fr

If you change your money to pesos your rich in india/Philippines
This dude going bankrupt
Where the 10,000$ i dit not smile
Thanks so much bro for what you are doing 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
see this is the difference between pointless fakes, and a genuine act of kindness. this is incredible
Wheres my 10k
Doing this kind of thing in front of the camera and then aiming for views is the worst
It didn't now give me my 10k
Like you, I have donated over a trillion Zimbabwean dollars
God bless you
Wheres my 10,000😈, but actually what you did/doing is really making peoples day and its the people that are actually trying that you should give to and not the bums doing nothing for money. Mad respect.
Things like this are awesome but I hate that I’m seeing it because it means that recording it for some sort of validation is more important than just helping someone or doing a good deed. God I hate this generation.
Im cold hearted
Where’s my money
Love this
You are angel
Is this real or just for the video??
Instead of paying their boss pay the worker
Looks like you owe 10k
I like it so bad and its filipino💖
I won the bet
I ain’t smile where my 10k
How dumb are you to add $ to pesos
Pff the white saviour...
$477 in dollars is $10,000 pesos sheeeeeeesh
Where's my 10,000 den actually
Where is my 10k$
Help people without using it for social media and get famous… no se puede ayudar a la gente sin presumir?…
Right where is my 10,000
Id like my 10k now
so how much if I cry ?
I like how she instantly got makeup and changed clothes after half the video
That one kid: Haha! I didn’t smile!
I won’t leave till I get my money
So glad this guy does this without ever making it about himself
Give me 10,000 NOW
Give me 10,000 i did’t smile
“You are like a angel”🥺
i was watching and amaze the kindness but when he say $10,000 pesos. wait what? he said 10,000 pesos with a dollar sign? 😅 by the way I'm a Filipino and we put Peso sign in our currency. Still god bless and keep safe☺️
Im not smile
Instead of making me smile, this made me tear up 😢
😊❤
I didn’t grin, gimme my cash.
Give me my money
25Php are a half of a dollar
I didn’t smile
Me rn: i didn't Smile sooooo.... Tell him to bring me my money. Yeaaaaaaaa
Kind of wish this wasn't filmed from the perspective of the guy but more an interview with the family to give them the spotlight. To really learn about them. Instead of just "rich guy does a solid" which can often come across as "charity for clout" we could really get an inside look at the family trying so hard.
If that was an American women she would have left her husband and took everything he owns.
Thailand 🇹🇭 please
Awwww
You are so nice and thoughtfull
God bless 🙌🙏
That's like just under $500 US. I am sure it helped.
$25 pesos?
10.000 pesos 69,39 pounds
Jesus loves you amen
wait what? other country's money is also pesos? i thought it's only philippines..
It made me smile 😃 😊
You make me cry man, thank you so much, greetings from Brazil
This man is incredible
Idk but i think it's fake cuz i already saw like 8 videos like that with different person's and always he gives more and always takes one and ALWAYS they tell the Husband is sick and he's saving his life ... Weird in my opinion
So cute
This is incredibly kind. You don’t understand how kind this is.
I’d like the $10,000 to be deposited into my NFCU account in 7 days pls and thank you🙏
And after that he Shot her and took the money back
Where my 10.000 at? Fake advertisement
🥰 awww
What country is this
This is such a great thing because this is some of their realities. That’s why I try not to judge everyone, you don’t know what others are going through. For them to be out there every day from dusk to dawn selling stuff is just amazing🥺✨
❤️
Lol she's probably just making it up
Imagine giving a woman 10000 pesos for a hug.thats almost 500 dollars usd
God bless you
As hard as this was, I forced myself to not smile, just so I could write this comment:  Where is my 100 grand?
‘Have a great day’   ‘si’
I love how theres rich people that do actually pull a Robin hood on themselves
These are not genuine
This gives me warmth in my heart ❤️ very sweet thank you 🙏🏼
for those that don’t understand mexican currency $10,000 peso = roughly $490 USD
Why would you put the dollar sign
I'm a codm player but on Nokia, it makes me smile seeing people give away hard earn money to others out of their hearts
best i really  love you people you helping so proud of you  💓🕊️ i wish you visit philippines country too
God bless! 🙏
What is the song?
I like how he could get more views with videos of people without a language barrier fro better reactions but he still helps out everyone
You owe me 10,000
for anyone wondering, 10,000 pesos is roughly 500 usd
ten thousand pesos is like 500 dollars still nice tho
yo imagine doing this but not recording hm
This didnt make me smile, pay up dude!
You are filming this It s not solidarity You just selfish
DAS SIND PESO UND KEINE DOLLAR
She: "you want all?" He: "I just want one you can keep the Rest, here is 10000 Pesos" She: "Fuck i thought i could call it for today, but now i have to stand here all day anyways to sell the fuckin rest of this shit."
Imagine if after he asked how much all of them are he just said “ok I’ll take one”
I smiled where my money at
She has that contagious laugh  Nice video
Cool if real, and I love to give people money, but Goddamn it all, I fucking hate the pricks who film themselves doing it and circlejerk about how good they are to do so. I get this bullshit recommended constantly, too.
If you cared you wouldn't film it
Playa del Carmen
I didn't smile at the end.
Where do you get all this money?
Dammit I had the $10000 till the end😇
Anyone else wanna be rich one day just so I can afford to do shit like this, it must feel amazing
"have a great day" si
This is what I want to see, randoms helping out . God bless , blessings to the whole workd
Your so nice to people ur amazing keep up the good work♥️♥️♥️♥️
Such hard working people. God bless them
All of a sudden I love white ppl
It didn't make me smile.
If the prices sound ridiculous to those who dont know 1 dollar roughly translates to 50 pesos
I really want to visit the first woman she seems so sweet
"$10,000 Pesos" I had a stroke.
Wow it's amazing how much 500 dollars mean in Mexico
I could really go for a torta rn
Are $ and pesos the same🤣
U owe me $10,000 Ian smile run me my check😒
I love this man 🥺🥺
Si.
Cringe
"$10,000 pesos" WHY IS THERE A DOLLAR SIGN
Idc you filmed it. When you helped them that much, you deserve the praise. Some might say you do it for clout but I think someone like this at least deserves some love.
Im mad gay bro
I wish people didn't film stuff like this. Especially adding the sad music. Not to be a bummer, but it kinda takes away the best part of giving when you make the giving eventually about urself and probably make a profit on the act. Not saying you do.
The lady in blue that was translating was confused because the total eat 2 thousand and he wanted to pay ten thousand, or 8 thousand more. The confusing part is that most of us are used to people trying to pay less than the vendor is asking. This guy made that lady's day! That's amazing what acts of kindness can make others so Happy....
Sorry to say but you owe me 10Gs bro
El: Que tenga un buen día Ella: Si
Lovely💯😄
😀
Woah you so generous that you film it and post it on social media to get more likes/views/subscribers and then more money. If you really want to be a generous person, don't film it. It didn't make me smile at all. Did I won 10000 too?
Oh only 25 dollar pesos?
awww
One pesos is 0.049 usd
This is super fucking cringe. You could have just gone and given them the money that’s cool but u didn’t have to video it.
This made my heart melt
To whoever is curious, he didn’t give them $10,000 usd. It was pesos, which equaled up to $500. Still nice of him tho.
Approved very few people left in this filthy world👍👏
THIS MAN IS AN ANGEL IN DISGUISE❤️❤️
❤️
you're changing lives bro🖤
When your realize it's only 400 dollars but still nice gesture
this made me tear up. Thank you for making her day
This didnt make me smile. I know how bad the situation in mexico is. Rather it was heartwarming to help people there. Its so dangerous even i stay away from helping others. A lot of innocent people as well corrupt doesnt deserve it unless you've studied them. I know its not my place to judge. I've been hurt but the only people i'd live to help are children. They are innocent, starting out with nothing, have someone to give them when their parents had more than enough to provide. The fault of the parent is difficult to understand. Most of the time theyre liars. Ive meet a guy who looked from Afghanistan. He would use his children for money to support themselves on the streets. After giving them 5 dollars because at the time i didnt have much more he was then scolding at his daughter in a different language. My assumption was to ask me for more. Disgusting but never again with adults. They only dig deeper into that hole.
I’m not crying you are🥲
Hey man I love this movement so much and would love to join as a translator 🥺❤️
🙏🙏💙
The Mexican mrbeast
Soooooo do I get the 10k if I didn’t smile??
Just saying I didn’t smile where’s my $10,000 at
It did make me smile
he is so awesome. that woman is super hardworking and is super cheerful even though she's going through a tough time. 🧡
I thought they were filipino until he said gracias-
wha
Good job sir
You bet $10k if this will make me smile, you lost the bet to a stone face
You are doing gods works brotha straight up 🙏
❤❤❤
You win! What's your Cashapp?!
Wheres my 10000
Have a great day, si
Time is really hard not only recently but daily for small business and especially these roadside cart sellers. If we could help them even just by buying something from them, it will makes their day too.
Hope this isn’t one of those guys that takes the money back after the camera stops recording
Yea. Great. Do it without the camera and not solely for views. The cynical side of me would like to point out the average minimum earning for a YouTube video that reaches 10 millions views is $75,000 from ad revenue alone. Which is 1.5 million in pesos. This dude spent a fraction of what he earns from his channel... he knows what he's doing. So does everyone else that does this sanctimonious bs. I'm sorry but channels like this just push my buttons.
Bro thank you so much for you doing what some people can’t that made my day ❤️
This man is pushin p 🔥
May God Bless you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
God bless us all 🙏❤️
Aawwee but i disnt smile so u lost the bet
Too bad the owner got all the money and the worker got nothing.
I’m glad acts like this aren’t just happening in America and happening all over the world. There are so many countries where people have a hard time even living and this man is making a huge impact
God is goooood
U are so so kind I am Mexican and I went there and there was poor people pls help them thank u 🙏🙏🙏
boludo....    QUIERO SALIR DE LATINOAMÉRICA
I’m almost certain that the boss takes the money I used to live in Peru and the bosses would steal the tips from the workers and the workers would have to give up the tips or else the boss would make them change their location of where they sell I remember the workers not accepting tips for this exact reason
For anyone wondering, it’s almost $500 usd
I didn't smile where my 10K at
Yes an angel
This is what we call and Angel from Heaven
Your the man brother pay it forward always
This ish be fake, and for publicity. It’s sad you bots can’t see that... people who do things out of the kindness of their heart and soul, don’t record to post and making the money back. #WickedWorld
Love these videos
Love Mexican People ❤
10 thousand dollars or pesos?????? What does $10,000 pesos mean?
wait why did u say gracias? that’s Spanish, not Filipino 😭
Now you owe me 10k
Stop normalizing this bs bro you don't have to throw a lot of money at poor people just bc they might need it its in such bad taste.
Oh Php is different got confused there for a sec they said peso
Why is it titled 10 000 $ pesos thats is either dollar or either pesos
so basically, she earned 10K Pesos and you are earning thousands dollars on top for the video, you should leave them % of your YT earnings not just that little
❤️ ✊🥲
Pesos not Dollar
So the boss showed up at the end and took all the money
Maybe if they ate properly they'd be healthy
+have a great day -si
So is it dollars or pesos ? 🙈
And now we rob her
Thank you for your beautiful soul. You’ve inspired so many. I just hope I could inspire others like you have
Respect ✊
Where's my 10k?
If I was rich or even well off I would do this occasionally, I'd be a regular at stores and occasionally buy whoever was there that day lunch.
Much love ❤️ and respect!!!!!!!
Somehow I managed to not smile and didn’t even have to try…
One time when I lived in Mexico I saw a guy recording stuff like you and then later that day I found his video
25 pesos is like 80 cents. So like less than a dollar for those bread😭
Don’t record it
Average Filipina sellers bruh, all hardworking respect
10000 pesos its 100 dolar
10 k pls
100 usd makes you a millionaire in laos
Him afterwards Gimmie my shit back
We did it! We found the good side of youtube
aww
1 USD is 20 Mexican pesos and 1 USD is 24 Cuban pesos and 1USD is 107 Argentine pesos so 10,000 pesos is barely 100 dollars if it was Argentine pesos
My face: 😐  My soul: 😇
$492.00 US dollars...nice!
Haha I thought she was Filipino cuz they say "pesos" in the vid
You should it gave the other lady that was working some of that money
It’s so sad that these days you really have to dissect everything you watch to make sure it’s not staged.  I find my self asking why this video is shot in two different takes from different days and why in the 2nd she is significantly better clothed and has her makeup done, might have something to do with knowing cameras were coming…
These are not dollars bruv
Where's my 10k
This is beautiful and just heart warming. We really need to be like you and help people out who are in need
Oh I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to have some of her food!?! I bet that woman makes some amazing food. That was amazing of you to give her 5x's as much as what she was asking for, plus only took 1 item and allowed her to sale the rest to continue making money. Everything listed on that sign behind her sounds so very yummy!!!
My soul felt cleansed after watching this!
Where my 10,000 at
I’ve seen my aunt do this in Mexico I know how hard she works everyday and I honestly I appreciate you doing this to these hardworking people ❤️
This is super wholesome but it makes me wonder what they think of him recording it lol. Obviously he gets their permission after but still.
I want my money
wow
:)
If I become rich, this is what I want to do 😭
This is exactly what I will also do when I inherit some old strangers millions, I WILL CHANGE LIVES!!!
The fact this guy doesn't speak spanish makes these videos painful to watch.
I wish we could just all help out each other like this❤️
Dude made 100k pesos off this video LOL
So u gave away 500$ . Wow big show off
Thats about 2.5k in US dollars.
Awww 🥰 them nice smiles and loving round faces remind me of my family 😭🥰 i think i gatta go visit home now
Amazing..u are real angel.. say hii  .i from Indonesia south east Asia
Don’t forget to film it
Look I’d like to do this, to make someone’s day by money,but I can’t. I can only simply smile and say thank you because for me, that can go a long way, right? Well I hope it does
Es raza😭
You are the sweetest  person I've ever seen!!!💗
wheres my 10,000
Now do this without cameras Rollin. Please don't stop helping people after the cameras go out, bc these acts mean a lot to people
❤
Everything in Mexico is hella cheap
"$25 Pesos" pick one man
This is the kind of shit i wana do for ppl. But im poor as shit
Bro wheres my 10k dollars?
Good woman...and a 'very' good wife...🙏❤️🙏🏼
isn't cinquenta 50?
Are you on Philippines????
Wheres my $10,000?
Casually pays 400x as much
Hey idk if you will see this but I’m Mexican and usually over there the boss will take a big chunk of that 10k when you encounter another try and give it to them personally after work so that none of the money you give her isn’t taken away unfortunately that’s the way it is with the a lot of bosses in Mexico not talking shit just stating facts. There is a saying over there that goes like this “ a Mexican biggest enemy is another Mexican “
the girl who’s husband is sick, she looks like louisa from encanto
She said 50 pesos at the beginning and he goes 25 lol
People like md are angels sent from the heavean to help us. God bless.
“But it’s the double “🤣🤣 bless her heart
God bless you
You owe me so much money bro where is it at?
Ayy 😫 voy a lloraaaaar
si
Pro trader
For the record, 10k pesos is roughly $500
Someday i will be like you when i have enough income to share 👍🏻
You don't need to record it...
Love this ❤️❤️❤️
Try that without having to film it and we will see how much of a hero you truly are. Nevertheless as long as you get your views that money you give away will be given to you in the end of the day!
No one noticed he put a dollar sign when they talk about the peso?
I do feel like writing 10,000$ into the caption is a little misleading. Its pesos so around 500$. Still great that hes doing that ofc.
Side note: The best AND cheapest food you can get is the ones from food trucks or stands like this. Don't bother with big chains. They give the best food for cheap and deserve more
Disgusting. If you want to do something good, then go do it, but no need to make it into some kind of philosophical story & film it to put o  the iternet..
Where my 10k xD
I was homeless and suicidal and God saved my life. A buddy came and picked me up and helped me get my life back together. I want to help people like this for the rest of my life.
When do i get my 10k
He isn’t like an angel he is an angel. We need more people like this! Keep up the good deeds man you definitely earned your pass to heaven.
But the boss pockets the money. If this was her business, that would be cool but she is not getting all that money. The boss would give her more product to sell.
$500 for some lunch. Seems like a good deal. The street food goes crazy
Philipino?
That is stupid. Going a poor area and giving someone that much money. I remember my mates old boy owned a construction business in Thailand and he gave the ppl that worked for him $25 USD an hour and he had to drop the wages to what the locals would get in a week because they would kill, bash and hurt each other to get those jobs. You think this is helping, but it isn't. If the locals see her with that much money she might get seriously hurt or killed.
This did make me smile. I even cried with joy. I could really do with the money. I have paypal to make payment easier. As long as your bet is still on? Happy to video chat too.
Yeah if you film yourself doing a good thing. Well its kinda weird. Still good but weird
Hope this inspired you to do some good
Thank you for helping La Raza 💪🏽 🇲🇽
Where is my money?
Strong woman.. her husband is sick so she takes responsibility of things. Thru sickness and health..
i didn’t smile where’s by money bro
We need you in Afghanistan, Syria , Palestina
Just a reminder the 10,000 pesos is 492.73 in the US dollar which is pretty freaking crazy thinking about it
I didn't smile. Now hand over the money
I didn't smile
Where's my 10k
The final si
Made me cry hope her husband gets well
That nigga cappin he know damm well he took that shit back
Youre lıke an angel hahaha
Call the boss?? Girl you shut up and this is your money
I always think about doing stuff like this I wish I could change peoples lives and give to others I do it as much as I can but this is heartwarming I wanna be like this one day
so sweet
Love it❤️
I love these videos but it’s just sad because people do this for online recognition and not just out of the kindness of their hearts
I didn’t laugh. Money
Mexicans
Filming it just fucking ruins it all.
Omg that’s a blessing ❤️🙏🏽
Need more people like this
Do we really need to record this for the world to see
You owe me $10,000
Not the same person
After forcing myself not to smile, I must inquire the payment method that you're going to use
When there’s still good in the world 🥺🥺
No word's just emotion ❤❤❤❤
Where is my money
‘Salamat’ is the word.
No mames wey es la del meme la de “disque señoritas” alv bro
Thanks for giving out to the RAZA in Mexico respect ma boy💯
I love that this is going to people who are trying to make it hustling everyday doing honest work
So where’s my 10k  I’m kidding, this was really heartwarming
🥰🥰🥰🥰
🥺🙌🏼❤️
Thats about 500 US dollars
Give me my 10k now. I am serious 😐 Reply to negotiate how you will transfer the money.
Run it give me my money 10,000 right run it
This is so heart warming I love this guy and for the woman she worked hard even though her husband is sick, respect.♥️
10 000 pesos not dollars = 500 dollars. But still good job I love it keep it up
-Have a great day -Si
What you did is good  but it's also bad for her buisiness. It's possible your hurting her in the long run.
Finally not something clickbait I’m always seeing making videos like giving”homeless” people money and its obviously fake but this one is actually real
Money can buy happiness 😊
sir i love u, i post this on my fb
That lady looked so happy to sell even one ❤️
But her boss probably took all the money
Who’s chopping onions? 😫😭 my heart is so warm after watching this. Thank you for being such an amazing human 🙏🏼❤️
U owe me 10k..
I can spend all my money in Mexico
She said 50 not 25
bro she must’ve thought u were a criminal lmao
That is very heartwarming
Warms my heart
With how good it feels to make other people smile there’s no way it’s not our purpose to bring happiness to each other and lift each other up
It didn't.
This is amazing
I think it’s funny how he uses dollar signs when talking about pesos
Nice
Wheres my 10000$
You don't help them with money, only with opportunitys
Where's my 10 grand?
Is good 👍😊
Beautiful
I didn’t smile where’s my money?
You have mind...respect
Thats just how Money should have to be used
I didn't smiled lol, give me the 10,000$ 🙂
She said 50 for 1
Take me so i can translate and be available to live that experience with u
Can I get my 10k didn't smile
Hello my name is renée de graaff I'm from Holland.   To keep my story t short .my life has been rough been bullied and cast away by everyone I have no friends and my family also abandoned me. I've fled from Holland cause something horribly has happened. After 4 years of drugs abuse they found a way to bully me so my energy had go down and vision gone blurry and is incredibly difficult for me to even walk. Now I found no better way  the changes seemed most when I ran to another country.  Because everyone in Holland tried to kill me maybe is different when I go to Tibet where there are many hippies so more love.  I tried in Holland last 4 years been in clinic.  They are literally bullying me to death hell me hello I need help. I dint want to die that all doomed holes in my brain. Even getting pleasure from it. I Derek so hopeless and alone. Hello me please
Where can i get the 10k dollars
Ur a good guy
I just don’t understand why you have to record it and do it out of love and not for a vifeo
You owe me $10,000.
10,000 pesos to be portrayed as a poor lady on camera for American entertainment seems ok.
NOT SMILE, THIS MAKE ME CRYYYY
I'm glad people do this but you shouldn't record it for views you should just give to people out of kindness
Title: 10,000 US dollars Video: 10,000 Mexican pesos
Bro owes me 10000
I hope the lady selling the stuff for the owner got a tip as well for being out there !!
Where is my 10,000
This title is VERY misleading, he is really giving her $487 dollars in usd. Not saying that this is not generous but definitely not 10,000 dollars
Very nice but your acting like you gave her life changing money. 10,000 pesos is $500 for those wondering. Still nice but you demean it by recording it and acting like your an angel.
Yep this really made me smile. 😊Hope her father is well.🙏🏾
How sweet
White People: *Speaking english to spanish people* Spanish People natural instinct: 😂😂😂😂😂😭😂😂😭😂
I didn't smile. But keep your money.
Sweet little lady ♥️
God bless you, so good to see great people I the world.  ❤🙏
O wow, he is such a nice person he has to show all of us 🙄
It's didn't. Pay up or I'll give up a link to my onlyfans
FYI if u didn’t know 20 pesos is .97 US cents so do the math
Where’s my 10k
God bless you
Americans be like DOLLAR 25 PESOS
"sí"
I love Mexicans because they got each other’s back for real.
500USD
The First Lady should’ve got the money. The real ones know
Yoo come reward me I'm broke
Bro I remember back then it was like 9 pesos per bag
Its funny he writing on screen pesos but anyway puts dollar sign
The spirit of the people is so beautiful
Brother, I just gotta say thank you to the bottom of my heart. I know some of my people down there work very hard only for little pay. They hustle so hard to keep going but you blessed this woman, thank you my good sir
God bless them all more then endlessly for always and forever 🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️🙏🏻❤️❤️
Suck cuz worker won’t get much the cartel boss n husband will
*Such an inspiration, someday humanity will help and love each other*
❤❤❤
The fact that humans have to pay to live on their own planet , bruh some persons have to go pass by hard situations because a piece of paper called money literaly controls everything and makes a lot of people to steal , kill , idk a lot of thing because someone decided to put a price in a fkg piece of paper bro , nah…
I didnt smile, now give me my 10,000$
Ngl that's risky my brotha.
Well jokes on you ... I didn't smile, I cried 🤍
Made me tear up she was so wholsome. 👐
Si
So he gives away thousands and thousands of dollars daily and weekly and only has 768k subscribers? That’s about 60k a year. He would be bankrupt in 2 months 😂 message is good but it’s staged!
Much respect to this man 🖤🤝
Amazing, do it off camera and keep the experience to yourself :) That’s the sweetest gift, doing that and no one besides you and her knowing. 🙃
Its so good to watch videos like this, but don't you feel weird recording it?
I would’ve took a few for later that look delicious 😋
I didn’t smile where’s my 10k
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
Hehehe me laughing inside knowing I’m rich in pesos but poor in dollars
Classical white savior complex. 😒🙄🤦🏽
does anyone know the song in the background
Kala ko pilipino
One day, I'll help to many people🥰
Since I watched this with a straight face do I get 10,000 dollars?
Kinda get the feeling you did this to get tiktok,you tube famous, not cus you actully care.
$10,000 would make a huge difference for me. It's not a lot of money to some people, but it would change my life.
❤️❤️❤️
I didn't smile
Lol. Finally its a boss take a money. Haha.
Second lady prolly thinks she scammed tf outta hom
I know your thinking this is good, but you probably put such a target on her back… my cousin told me a story of how he gave this kid a brand new pair of vans… he lost his life that same day without any shoes on his feet… if you do something like this… especially giving out cash, I feel like you have to also provide safe passage… your donation goes a long way, but safety is priority… juss some food for thought, I’m genuinely interested on what you guys think about this though.
Why do You record it?
shouldnt have gotten the boss involved. now they gonna try to take it
That's si cute
Its all nice and all till you realize that 10k Mex pesos are about 500 dollars
Aw make sure she’s in good hands , a lot of bad people there that will try to take it
"Really siCKKKK"
Doing this for the video this is fake
♥️
Those laughs and smiles, they are priceless..
You a great human being bro💓 Love U to .
GOD BLESS YOU ❤
This guy knows its not beneficial to buy everything from them good man
Wie alle 0 Mathe könn mein 10:2 also bitte
Gave all that money to the owner of the stand and not the worker having to stand there all day. Real American shit
Nasa philiphinas ka?
That was going to make me smile ?
Or you could've just done the math yourself. Price for one + how many there are and just gave them the extra but no wanted content of being generous
This always make me wander are you genue or is it for the vieuws
Hope he have more and more to give. He's saving humanity.
its 10000  pesos not dollars.
No wtf this is the cutest thing 😭
✨🎬 💖✨
ya me imagino que la jefa se queda con los 10.000 y a ella solo le dan el día libre
$=Pesos. Aha. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Smile? I'm fuckn crying
Bro that’s crazy like I’d cry tf
All for the likes. Embarrassing
❤️So beautiful I hope her husband gets better and healthy❤️🙏🏻
Awwww🥺🖤🖤.
❤️❤️🙏🏼
I was so confused at the begging when it said $25 pesos (25 dollar pesos?) didn’t know those existed
This annoys me. Just give it away and be humble about it. Stop gaining views for doing a kind deed. It's no longer sincere.
send my 10k I kept a straight face
This is one of the most hatebale things I’ve ever seen
living in a rich country make then live in a poor country 🤷🏼‍♂️
Did the owner give the worker  some amount aside from her daily wages as a BONUS? I, mean, shared it with her? 🤔
If you really wanted to do a good deed here you wouldn’t have recorded this
Its AMAZING how the Smallest of Gifts can Change Someones Life /World !! Not sayin 10 k is small, some rich ppl bet that on 10 spins of a slot machine at the casino..Anyways, Salute for this Video!!
10000 pesos is nowhere near $10000 your labels are so confusing
I never commented ona short but keep doin this<3
Next time don't record it
Is 10.000 pesos not dollars
"Thanks, have a great day!" "yes"
I smiled where’s my 10000
God bless u for helping the needy.  ♥️🙏
It takes so little to brighten someone else's day. Yet it can leave them feeling happy for a moment, an hour, a day, or give them a sweet memory for life. Help someone in need (esp. the elderly), tell someone you care about they’re amazing, compliment the chef who just made your delicious dinner, post something positive or leave a kind comment on social media, even just smile at people around you... And it will make you feel pretty awesome, too 🙌.
I wouldve broken down on the spot tbh
W man 😕
-have a great day  +si  KSKJDJ
I love what your doing man. Hard times really can have people down and low im currently in it right now but these videos make me smile! Your a hero 🚀👍🏻
I love how she translate like “her husband is sick and for example you like an angel”, meaning he saves their life and brighter their day ❤️
When I traveled in South America I did this when I shopped or ordered food. It meant so much and I’m glad I did it.
These are the best😭😭😭
I didn’t laugh, can i get 10.000?
W
You give a woman 500 dollars and you make a video about it, yt / tiktok / insta pays you 30k dollars for commercials etc. If you want to be altruistic, give that money and don't record, don't throw in to Web and dont make a saint out of yourself.
I thought this was the Philippines at a second
This is very  wholesome  Making the world better
Oh yikes
God bless her and her husband
I didn't smile👀
They are so nice to them bro this is amazing this made my day
Jesus loves you my friend
esto m hace tan feliz, really hope she and her family are doing well now <3
You are an Angel 💗💗💗
Beautiful
HI
Can I get my 10.000?
I didn’t smile I want my $10,000
Omg i love this
I need 10k too 😭
Hell nah mans must b carrying a piece or something u could easily get mugged showing around that kind of cash
Helping for views, the thing you just did has lost all of its meaning.
They dont work for money, they work to survive, Siempre humildes la raza❤️🇲🇽💪🏾
So if its 10k $ its 50k php cuz 1$ = 50 php
🙏🏽
You owe me 10000$
God always provides.  May he send blessings to all that deserve.   Keep your faith my fellow brothers and sisters

Ive never struggled so much in my life as I am right now My spouse was almost killed in Oct 2021 and since that day my life has been a struggle I work 2 jobs Leave at 7am and home at 1130pm 5 sometimes 6 days a week Yet I'm still smiling Thanks for this
Him taking one to allow her to keep selling is amazing
All right this one u win but u still iwe me @ 200$, sooo, i dint wana make presure but fukn pay up
I'm pretty sure she said "Cincuenta (50)" when  the translation said it was 25 xD
SHES not gonna thank him a year later.. she is going to thank god..
Bro that lady is not gonna see a single peso of that and that lady the owner she keeping it all and will tell this miracle tale to the whole family
Man I’m glad someone is out there making others peoples lives a little easier, everyone is going through something.
If the one percent did this even a little bit, the world would be a better place. Bless this person for their generosity. This is my favorite thing about the internet, being able to touch so many ppl with such a simple sweet story. I wish the government, that is supposed to help the ppl, would do their job so this woman wouldn’t even need to be there In the first place.. so sad. I hope I can be able to bless ppl like this in the future<3
Jokes on you I'm heartless
Need more of this in the world
Bruh I’m dead see people homeless street  boy and girl and African people homeless kids and baby and  not eat food and  people die hospital diseases and this guy   L  and good day
This will be a better place if everyone those this all the time God bless him..🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️🙏🙏❤️

That’s my moms bestfriend , her husband passed away and it’s been very hard so thank you very much.
Genuine ppl help others without posting it on a social platform for self recognition. Just do it because your heart tells you to. I help ppl all the time but I never brag nor tell anyone.
have a good day! si
Imagine what this world would be like if this happened to people that needed it every day this world would be an amazing place to live
Your amazing person you give hope to all who need it  God bless you 🙏

Love you man, and I don’t even know you.
I didn't smile... So where is my money?
You owe me $10,000 now because you made me cry not smile 🥰💕🙏🏽
My heart always feels warm when I see people doing things out of love. If only everyone would be like this......the world would be heaven on earth
These videos always make me cry.
If I ever become rich I'll walk the streets and donate money to vendors and people
Gimme my 10k I didn't smile
It’s about $500 he is giving her
There is more people who are struggling more then those people, at least you give or search for them...    This lady have a job not job it will be considered a business... search for the right people.

Which country is this in? Costa Rica? Ecuador?
This is why I watch YouTube shorts.❤️
I don’t like these videos because they use these to make money trying to come off as a good person .. why record it
❤️
"have a great day" "si"  I love that
Um the translator is wrong it’s actually 50 not 25
It’s not $.
Most of these videos never really effect the way they are intended to, but this one did. It was a great conversation exchange as well lol. The lady who helped translate was hilarious 🤣 she said,  I don't understand you. Then she said, the lady thanks because YOUR husband is sick and u r SORTA like an angel! It just seemed genuine, that woman was deeply grateful, its in her facial expression. Good  job 👍🙏
Man I need this guy to pay off my student loans! 😂
Where is my mobey
@MDMotivator this didn’t make me smile so where’s my shit my guy 🙃  Kinda need it to surprise my cousin who lost her dad for Valentine’s Day  Btw I’m in South Africa (sending love from SA)
10000€ is too much… go around and give 1000 to different people in need
I’ve visited Mexico because my parents were from duarte Guanajuato which is middle of Mexico and one peso there is worth less than ten cents so 10,000 pesos is basically giving 500 to someone here showing that something that we would think is low in us is worth so much more in mexico so thank you so much for sharing this and helping her out because it reminds me of my parents trying to save money and send it to my grandparents and aunts and uncles
No, i cried 😂
My dude where do I get my 10 Grand?
GOD bless you both.
Huh???
Wow~~ he just give money away~~ cuz that helps~~ he must care~~ THE fck? Those are hard working people and he goes and stabs them in the heart. Showing them how he can give 475 dollars away so easy and the work they do means nothing.
Who the person recording ?
Awesome 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
God bless you all and your families 🙏🏽
😩her husband sick and she’s working what a strong woman
I tried doing stuff like this for people but I don’t have much and needed help but it never came together😩 but I’m glad to see someone able to make it and do good in this world. You should of brought them to families that needed food is the only thing I would of changed but I do know that giving food is also a tricky situation as well if someone was to get sick.
7 million people waiting for their 10.000$
Aww!! God bless you and that ladies family 💕🙏🙏🙏
You never know what someone is going through.. this is absolutely wonderful hopefully though know one took the money from her though 😞
I didn’t smile where’s my $10,000
I hope she dont give it to her boss.
Where’s my 10k 🤔
This is the mrbeast we all need in latam
If i have that 10k dollars i will be rich in my country. 🤩💰
Don’t get too many people involved when handing out big money like that. Just hand it to the person you’re intending to give it to because other people can switch up and take advantage of that.
Give me my money
Te amo ♥
Wheres my 10,000?
♥️♥️
And that’s how the Florida housing market got fkd!
I’m saying still good but like click bait but it’s not $10,000 usd it’s in pesos it’s like $500. If it’s was that much it would be 207,000 pesos.
ohh I thought your in Philippines
Pay up i did not smile you clickbaiter
Honest woman, God send a true angel  when needed thank you for being there😇💫💫💫
someday I'll be like you, then give them happiness😁
I bet this guy will make you sad to happy🥰
Die Frau strahlt STÄRKE und MUT aus, als könnte Sie nichts erschüttern... Sie strahlt so, wenn sie lacht 😆😊🙏
Give me my 10k, i didnt smile.
Mighty Whitey
I really wanted to know what she was selling
Gives 10,000$ “si”
Is It Philippines Because I'm From Philippines Peso Means Coin
A huevo, ya salió pa las caguamas del mes
❤❤❤❤❤❤
People with pure hearts like you help others, I'm praying May GOD BLESS You
You’re doing gods work my friend
I didn’t smile bro. Run me my money plz. Too hard to smile when you’re going thru hell daily
Awe God bless him!
Wish someone could see me with my giving spirit ...I'd give it right back to the less fortunate minus a vet visit to save my dog's life.  She is my PTSD support animal and I won't let her suffer.  I've started eating only 2 times a week to afford her meds.  If I don't create enough she will die...but I'd still give back to others...it's right.
my 10k?
Her boss got it... poor woman hope her husband gets better soon 🥺💕
Sad how hard working lady didn’t keep a dime of the $10,000! Greedy boss kept all the money
im am actually from philippines and even 20 pesos mean so much for a person.
Next time gif it with out video then you are the man
So nice
I love this
I love this dude...he does the good things that I'm usually unable to do.
Where He have the camera ?
If i had millions id do this without the camera lol
Gimme that 10k easiest 10k of my life
“but this the total? :/ i dun understan you”
Oh my god we havent seen this before
Another video you owe me money. Where do I send my invoice?
Oh that's not Philippines b cuz I heard pesos
Wheres my 10.000 at
The lady getting the $10,000 pesos is not the lady in beginning of video. Looks like her boss came right down when the lady called her.  So my question is did the boss get $2,000 and the other lady got the remaining $8,000?? or did the boss keep it all??
will definitely help people like this once i have the means to do so
Mmm, yes, we must be kind to our abuela, this brings me much serotonin
😭
So the boss got to keep all of it? I hope she gave at least some to the worker that we see in the beginning.
Tell her I said it was just for a video an she gotta give me dat shit back rn for I kick the table leg off
Whats this song that in entrey of video
I haven’t even helped my people this much , you really are angel ! God bless you brother !
But 10000 pesos is like 500$ max
Amazing❤️ Both her as a person, but also him being so generous!
The First Lady said she had to call her boss before making the decision. What people don’t know is that the boss is someone that has another 10 or even more people working for them, selling things like that out there. That lady I’m 100% sure she didn’t get anything from the 10k pesos.
He is the best man
I love you man
I miss living in Mexico. .. watching people  literally work  7 days I n the street just for food or for any reason and still be capable of being that cheerful  always made me smile .  I use to have conversations with the guy that came through in a cart and ice cream for few minutes I saw him for a few years and never saw him again , years after I learned he got sick and his son who grew up  ran the ice cream cart and had a legit job  . I was there randomly that one day when I learned that he was sick and I hope they both are better and happy still .
You live in Mexico nice great help
god...they used to be so beautiful.
I will take my 10k
International mr beast that you?
Idgi. He asked her 1 day and then went back the next. Cause lady is all dolled up in next scene
Where's my 10k.
Make positivity louder! ❤️👏🏼
Guve me 10,000
I smiled, now gimme the $10,000.
Ok really nice but recording yourself doing this is actually kind of selfish
https://youtu.be/kNfwmkxaeDU
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 DONT KNOW U BUT APPRECIATE YOU
Mans is the next Mr beast, istg
So the employee didn’t receive anything and the lady who owns the stand gets all of it?
We all wish we had the money to do something like this
Is that the Philippines  🇵🇭?
10,000 pesos isnt 10,000 dollars lol but still a cool gestures
Mi gente ♥️♥️♥️♥️
I really love it when people use their wealth or money to help others or bring joy to the world.
Where’s my 10k dollar?? I didn’t smile
In Argentina that money may seem like a lot, but it's actually not that much :( Third World Country harsh reality
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😲
He's only making these videos to make money off these people lmao he does not care
I'm glad you help out where it is really needed. Keep up the great work.
Omg this melts my heart
This man really is an angel
When regular people do more than the government has ever done.
This man is the second mrbeast
Thank you for helping our people 🙏🏽 Nice to see them smile for a change
Be very careful giving someone that much money out in public
Cringe 😬
sometimes, my faith in humanity is restored a little
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Philippines?
She's got a beautiful smile
Awww I love how the girl is like "but this is the total????"
God bless you

Es la señora que dice , disque joven.

As a Filipino: "awww hes giving free money to them!!" Sees him say pesos: "Peisous.."  (I dont mind the way he says it tho- its fine alot of americans say it like that)

Love to see your videos boss, as a Hispanic who grew up in Mexico and was born in the US the struggle is very difficult. Even though some of them struggle they get up every morning to help their family. Much love keep doing what you doing! Giving back to anyone in need is an amazing sight to see!💯
people talk shit about recording stuff like this, but it’s nice to see.
where my 10gs at?
Only if there wasnt a middle man pinching that as soon as you walk away shes lucky to get a 1000
God works in mysterious ways. I am so thankful for this life. That person is a good man for helping make soneone elses life a little better.
This is really nice of u. Buy did the lady that was working for the other lady get any of that or just the owner, i really hope she gave her employee a couple hundred too. Wish u many blessings to keep helping others in need.
It would have been better if both the owner and the employee received money. I loved the laughter of the employee;it was contagious!🤗
This made me wanna cry a lil , really sweet
God bless 🙏❤️👍
He gave that money to the money maker there… the first and last lady should have gotten that money. Observe….
Aww🥺🥰
I LOVE YOU
Those people are so amazing they barely making it but they're kind and honest
Are you giving them 10,000 pesos or 10,000 dollars?!?
I could watch these all day. We need more of this. I have to find my genuine way to help. Keep it up brother!
You are amazing bro changing peoples lives but most of all putting smiles on peoples faces who deserve it ❤️ I hope with my efforts on starting my charity I can do the same keep up the great work bro 💞
These ppl work so hard man, I wish I had drive like them
Show the Love of God! You are a real vessel.I love everything about this video❤
The is way cooler than any of this shit in the US or EU.  This is legit. Love this interaction. The genuine emotion in the man’s voice as he talks is so raw. It’s a great human experience and it’s wonderful to be able to see it like this. Good for you sir. Good for you. Fuck it. Good for Humanity that you’re out there fighting for all the rest of us clowns. ❤️🙌🙌🙌❤️
350 pounds will help a lot
God bless you my brother
She is, calling the cops on you, get  out!
Her husband is really sick.  I was ready to cry man

It's easy to do chairty with pesos and be an angel when you have dollars on your side.
Where my money
Ya know filipinos and spanish people are the same kinda languge like fillipino:tepetura spanish:tempetura
Kindness never goes out of style.
“Have a great day!” “Si” had me lmao
Ahorita lo mexicanos somos un atractivo turístico para la gente primer mundista :D

"alright guys cut the cameras now lets take our money back'
She didnt seem grateful at all.  Woulda took it back. She didn’t even say thank you. She said yes when he said thank you lol
pesos:❌ Pay sauce:✔️
MY HEART 😭 This is wayyy to wholesome oh my gosh😭
Crazy to know now after looking it up. 10,000 pesos is like $485 usd still nice and still happy you did it. But 10k pesos sound much bigger. Shocking her whole store is only worth $485 usd though
Hugs, happiness, kindness and smiles are an international language good on you mate 🤙
You just gave money to someone too stupid to realize what you did
Ahhh
You are a great person as a person that is like the person that you are helping but with a lot less than the people who you help and I'm in a dark place in my life gives me hope for a better world thank you for the hope and impressions of a world for my kids to live in keep it up and thank you again
GodBless❤️🙏🏻
Where my 10k at🤔
He makes it confusing to understand he should just say I'd like one of these and to donate money not In gonna give her more than what ur total is ya know
HUMAN-BEING
Sorry to burst your bubble but I doubt her husband is sick at all. I've heard that same story so many goddamn times
I want to be financially well off so I could do things like this. It blows my mind that the wealthy would rather play space race instead of solving everyday real world problems..
Wheres my 10k
Him•Have a great day Her• Si  😂
❤️❤️❤️
She almost busted the I can't sell you everything but I'll sell you some lol , they must enjoy that time away from home a bit to decompress . She's like if he takes everything I have to stop working today they're hard workers
Bro doing right
Oh for God sake...... 🙄🙄🙄🙄
where’s my 10000$?
I love these videos.what you're doing is so kind.
That's so sweet and wholesome. More people need to be like this! It's so kind of him to do that! God bless and I hope your having a wonderful day!
This touched my heart ❤ 🥺🥲
This made my day....there is still good in the world...we need to quit focusing on the negative...
Even if this made to boast the giver's ego I don't give a f--- he is good about and being friendly and spreading a message of kindness so the ego boost is deserved
The First Lady, you should have given her directly, as I think the boss is going to take the money!
If you give Charity, Give it with your right hand that your left doesn’t even know you have given Charity.  Means give Charity not to show off or show people  But it’s good at least your helping people!
I've been to Cholla Bay Mexico a couple times this was a late 90s and early 2000s when I went and extremely extreme poverty and honestly like ten thousand pesos is not even that much in US dollars at all these people are literally scraping by for Penny's just to make it through the day
Why dont you use your own currency
You're making the currency of Philippines for fun huh ..!!! Shame on you... You just doing it for views and likes .. shame on you
You are Angel!😭😢
She did not even react when she got the money
Are you setting yourself for kidnapping for being rich American?
shoutout to all the hispanic mamas working they ass off to support their loved ones❤️ a mothers love is a warm and strong one
Didnt make me smile and I didn't even read the title before I already watched it, where's my money bi-
These type of videos Count~
I hope the lady at the stand got some money and not just the boss lady .
Your awesome bro
I normally don't like it when people film their deeds but in this case there's nothing wrong with it because he's blessing these people and showing the cheer on their face as he does so
Im a tagalog people to
This made my day we need more people like you in dis world
This really touch me deep 👌
❤️🙏🏽🇨🇦
That was soooo sweet omg he is an angel the poor women is out there working hard to help her husband !!!She totally deserved that!!!!God Bless you!!!❤💕🥰🥰
run me my 10 bands
I didn't smile, do I get 10k now?
Why didn’t you put $500 instead? $ is for dollars lmao not pesos
Lie! That didn't make me smile...It made me tear up. Nice to see good, hard-working people catch a break, and good, heart-felt gestures like this lifting others up.
This was beautiful and great, but I made it a mission to not smile. I passed and need my $10,000 immediately, please and thank you.
This is why we need to support REAL small businesses not influencers claiming to be a small business
I appreciate you for this but you owe me 10,000 now dead serious
its not 10k $ its 10k pesos
AHHHHHH CUTEEEE
Where my 10k I didn’t smile
I am filipino too :D
I love hearing rough translations about acts of kindness, " you are like Angel" gave me goosebumps
Dry reactions but you did a great job
I'm crying rn cuz dis lady didn't have $15 n da bank fkd hur over n da lady she was y tryna overs accounts  I can't wait for WorldPeace so all their families can just be healthy safe and happy 🙏💯
You owe me $10,000.
You sound like a colonizer
Your doing a beautiful thing,  you just gave the owner $ that’s the boss and they usually have several booths and they pay the workers and the worker got nothing becuse you offered to buy rather than give her $ so she had to call her boss and was cut out of the entire thing
I love Hispanic people they deserve so much better
I would live to do this I pray my LORD father GOD will bless me so I can help many people in many ways in Jesus name I pray amen
Plot twist, her boss is going to take it all!!!
This is nice but the owner came and jus snatched that money would be nice if the hard worker got it idk it’s all great
This is why I appreciate the Mexican culture so much. They are hardworking people who rarely complain about anything and get the job done. ❤️🇲🇽
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
You should buy the stuff an give it out. Some people make more when the stock is gone, her boss would of refilled it.
Good Health, Long Life. God Bless everyone. 🇵🇭
Bruh you gonna get someone killed!
He’s gunna get her robbed.
Paypal me i diddnt laugh

It’s so kind why he is doing. But is he not worried that he is making them a target?  The wrong person can be watching.  I’ve witnessed it first hand asaltos es algo serio. GOD bless your kind heart
10,000 pesos is like $500 USD for those who don’t know
Nice tax write off 📴
God bless y’all 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
You are a beautiful human being, it's a shame that this is very rare to see
🙏❤
Omg I need 10,000 pesos for me right now! 😭😭😭
Translator in shock.
He should have been more specific because now her boss is going to want some of the cut.
He should have been more specific because now her boss is going to want some of the cut
Why u keep sayin it will make u smile why will it god nos wat u on
Now give me my money
How come I don't meet people like this 😜😜
Awwww
She is so sweet...❤️🥺. Such a warm-hearted moment, when we learned about her husband. This didn't only, majorly helped her husband, but it also made her day i bet.
10k pesos is 150 pounds.....that's fucking wild.. I make a little more than that in a day so fucked up that this kind of money changes these peoples lives....
GICE ME 10K IN USD RN
Dang pay up man
Respecto man 👍
My buddy was going to do the same but he got mugged. 🤣😵👈
god damn i love this shit 🐐.
Don’t film yourself doing acts of kindness, it’s really annoying
I could go to my country I would this  very often
Idk why I laughed
another person doing this for attention as usual
This is typical trashy Facebook crap yes Facebook you are a crappy organization
That's cool. Now do it without the camera
10000 Dollar or Pesos
It’s only $485 in us currency wild
How to be a living legend 101. What a god.
I love you’re heart. I’m the same way!
🥰
Respect if youre not doing it for likes
U failed
It's just awful how many stories are out there sad depressing stories and what some people live through is just incredible! Such pain out there . Thank you for being an angel on this difficult earth
There's not enough space in all of YouTube to tell you what's been happening in my life... This guy's videos have given me hope that "humanity" is still alive and well in this world... How beautiful are his videos!?!?...  (Hebrews 13:2)
Alhamdulillah
I love La rasa
Love these videos
Bro I’m telling you. You have know idea how much you’re really helping the beautiful people of Mexico. Believe me my man they will be speaking about you for years
Rich people throwing money at poor people…Yup really motivational..
She says ur husband to the guy in translation hahahha
He basically gave her like 500 bucks
Don’t get fooled by this guy, he makes a LOT more with the shorts views then the 400USD he spends to make one. In one video the guy tell him that all his stuff would be 30k pesos and he says thats alot of money can you do 10k pesos. Like wtf?
This is nice but it encourages weird tourism. Then they look at us like we are walking wallets.
_Have a great day -Si 😎
Bcus they work double harder then most and rarely complain. Def deserve this
Awsome
I genuinely love this guy, just so damn much
This women is adorable
Um  idk why but somehow i felt a knot in my throat...  Brain: its called feelings Me: um Nope I dont have those 🤣😂😅
It's about $250 American dollars, and a month or more of most working people's income.
❤️❤️
Dude 🥲
Where's my 10k?
Where’s my $10,000 bucks at? I wanted to smile BUT $10,000
Awesome. Praise God. Your generosity is dearly noted.
Wow
i’m taking spanish class and was confused when she said ‘cincuenta’ but 25 was written in the subs hahaha i had to look it up to make sure i wasn’t wrong again XDD
I do this online for kids
Awesome. Need more people like this guy in the world 🙏
Is pesos not peysos
I love how the rich think this is a heart warming video when they stole this money from the laborers that made that money the tards that make these don't understand why people are poor
I needed this thank you.
This is a weird sex tourist flex
Lmao the money went to her boss 🤣 😂 😭 💀
Try doing 20 of these type things without telling anyone ….. keep your good deeds between you and god…. And reap the rewards off him
$25 pesos????
Where is my 10k
so just a genuin question, are you attempting to learn other languages to be able to speak with others without someone translating?
Where’s my 10gran
I wish I could smile but I killed my hope and faith in humanity but you sir you may revie them
She doesn't understand because she's asking 2,000 pesos for the product... And anybody would be confused and ask why are you offering me 10,000 when I'm only asking 2000 LOL I love these videos
Wow
I need my 10k because I put tape over my mouth
LOL "Gracias, Have a nice day"    "Si"
I didn’t smile… u sir owe me $10k USD
I didn’t smile can I have my $10,000
Mexicans are the best. Wish them all well.
Good dude
Protect this guy at all costs ❤️
Looks like you gave the wrong lady the money.
Maan god bless you! My goal is to do the same one day, thats all i want!
I hope the translator woman didn't lie and told her what he said and actually gave her the money
God bless everyone 🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏😇😇😇🥺🥺🥺
😊
I need someone like you in my life right about now. But prayers and blessings to you for changing yve lives of each and everyone you help. 💙🙏🏿💙🙏🏿💙🙏🏿💙
Lol so you gave it to her boss and not the worker , the original lady ?
Where’s my 10k
I wish I could do this for people
You really are a angel though 😇
Didn’t need to be crying today but here I am
anything for views
En el nombre de Jesus.
Very inspiring
💯💯💯
🙌
You are an angel.
As a Mexican thank you
He could do all this without the cameras. Only reason he is doing this with cameras is so he can get views and become more popular
Bro, this is awesome!!!!!
This is why we hate the blm movement. We are Americas backbone. The hard workers. We don't riot or loot. We don't complain about the past. Fk blm.
That is not ok from my point of view. It looks to me that he makes a show of his money. « I don’t understand you »
Where my 10k
Well done. Aloha
I didnt smile weres my 10k
I have been a fan of your Cha Nel for a while and you are amazing please keep up the good work. You are the reason the world keeps hope
Weres my 10k Lol
So how do I collect my money? You need my cash ap or something?
Lol get out of here
This is a great thing for this young man to do. But is it only encouraging more people to come over here when we have our own homeless
Mate...im a 51 year old male... You bring me upmost joy to my soul...i cry everytime i watch one of your shorts...they are happy tears...calming tears...you make me believe...i truly believe we all can make a difference...i mean look at the vast difference you make...and thats just 1 person...imagine if we all done that...all of us helping the next person who are less fortunate than us...we would be so so so powerful.
I smiled. Before I read your bet.  I’m a loser
Outstanding Humanity act
He should have gave some to the worker too. I feel like she may not get any at all. And still be stuck broke trying to sell them things still
I want to do stuff like this
Bro those Caritos have the best food fax
Should of given her asking price for her boss and gave her the remaining 10k pesos 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
I'm really hungry for this food!
Can't wait to start doing this when I'm wealthy ♥️
Latinos are some of the most happy people, even in bad situations, they’re alive and safe, that’s all that matters
I just want my 10k I didn't smile
The world needs ppl like u God bless you for helping....🤗❤️💯🌟
GOD BLESS YOU
Wait but the woman he gave it to was not the one working
She got rob right after that
They will say anything... I'm from Dolores Hidalgo, GTO and these type of people are everywhere... Yes most work their asses off everyday but also YES THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE... DONT BE FOOLS
It's about 60 euros 👍
Didn't make me smile 😒
Matthew 6:1-4 KJV BIBLE
You are a gift from God
Owner gonna take most that money away from her 🤣
What a guy 👏👏👏👏💛
Be careful doing this. You’ll see people looking at you. If they know you have money like that, you will be killed
These the Dabool
The lady working hard selling the stuff for her boss didn’t get shit???? Very fucked up
Look bro I dont usually comment or cry due to a video.i sobbed like a boy again,thank you I needed a reminder of what faith is...FAITH is humanitys only hope for ate future fatith in are own acts.
Her boss def took a cut of that money
You are an angel!
Muchas gracias por hacer eso. Apílale a la gente es lo mejor que podemos hacer💕
Loved it man huge respect to you❤️🙌
Not to be rude but I need the money
Better be careful doing that in Mexico. You’ll either end up in a cartel or dead.
I didn't smile, pay me my 10,000
$50.00 is all 10,000 pesos is!
And the majority better be going to her
Should have gave it to her on the down low so she didn’t have to call her boss and she coulda kept it all
Your the Best, God Bless you for all you do. Pay It Forward. Pray many Blessings to you and your family
10,000 pesos is about 480 USD
Why the other lady. Why not the one that’s actually selling them ?
Real talk though that is probably some of the best Mexican food you’ll ever have
Recpect 💯
Doesn’t one dollar equal 20 pesos
Lol I’d go around and look for the younger ladies and Bribe them…. Oh the good days 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone else hear the chick at the end start to say thank you
Good fix video
please keep doing what your doing this is so sweet and your changing so many lives
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
10,000 pesos ≈ $480 usd
People even more poor could of used that money
Poor people are the most nice people. Money corrupts people. It happened to me to when i was making big money. I was pure evil
Thanks to people who travel and have love to share ❤ 💕 💛 💖 💓 💗 that care about others wish the world to do the same thing
Wow awesome
Her boss shows up and takes it all
Thank you little do you know you Just saved a life
I'm so down for this kinda stuff.
Keep doing what your doing man🙌
Dawg it’s not $10k tho it’s pesos, one dollar is 20 pesos so
Love the positivity but why there gotta always be a dude that comes out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the actual vendor that starts preaching how tough everything is in every single one of those vids
Your ego is taking over and youre doing it to my people.
This is why yt stories are better than tik tok to me there's way more of this content here
Thanks for giving her that, I sent the gang to take it back shortly after 😎🤝.
Sad part is the Cartels took it when he walked off
Remember if you stay positive great things will happen to you
Damn her boss kept it all👀🤭😆
Wheres my money?
That is such a great thing that you do!
God she reminds me so much of my grandma. Rest her soul
Love it

I'm working, but if I were home I'll cry that so wonderful
Imagine someone doing this and not filming , dude you don’t give a f about here people you are only thinking how good it makes you
Considering I was held as a POW in Mexico by Cartel. I am still not happy with anyone from South America!
Give me my 10000 hehe Jk jk jk
Been living in Mexico and loving it. These people are wonderful.
❤
Them people giving away money don’t do that in American.
When he said have a good day.                          Lady: SI!
Apparently 25 pesos is 25 euros
You are making a real difference in the world. Your restoring faith in humanity by spreading kindness and making people feel great. I love your videos and you inspire us to want to do better. Thank you for what you do man. We appreciate all that you do.
Really! How sweet!!
🙏
Where is my 10 grand
I m struggling to do my degree (Msc). Anyone who would just give me loan would be angel. Where do u exist Dear angel? Come to my house as well. Seriously.😅 And thanks for turning people's cloudy life to sudden  sunny bright life like an angel.😌😇
Thank you for your kindness and help other people God bless you
Pay up
I love watching you do this! What a beautiful woman! And you are really making such a difference for hardworking people trying their best! I sincerely hope that she takes a bit and goes and buys herself a nice new dress and treats herself to get her hair done! She deserves it!
Congrats, for 500USD you're getting views and reputation. Good deeds shouldn't be turned into content or uploaded or its demagoguery.
Where’s my 10k
I’ve always believed in helping those in need when you’re in a position that allows you to. You sir embody that, thank you for helping our world.
"but this is the total"
This guy makes me cry everytime! So many people work so hard for hardly making anything. This is just Beautiful!
I to need money 🥺
It wasn’t $10,000 dollars it was 480.61 dollars in U.S.
Keep up the amazing work! 1 day u will get a humanitarian award just wanted to say Love u bro ur a hard workin man
That’s like 1,000 usd it’s not that much
₱10,000 is not $10,000, get your symbols right. I'm glad it still brought her to smile 😃
This experiment is really not cool.  All of the money goes to the OWNER, not the lady and her daughter out there sweating all day.
Condescending and making fun of Mexicans for internet fame is pathetic.
You lost your Bet. Im Not laughing at all..
VARUN PURTHI
I love her laugh. Hop her boss gave her the rest of the day off with a bonus.
That's cool but why you gotta record this stuff? Can't you just do it instead of shoving a camera in the person's face?
I just want you to know that what you do truly inspires others. God bless you. I love you.
😍
What a good guy
You have no idea how far she will make that money stretch. You did a good thing
Where my 10k
This one time in Ecuador i went to a obviously struggling resturant. Mom cooking and two daughters serving and i mean maybe 8 and 4 years old. They did such a wobderul job and i left them 5 bucks for a tip. As im walking down the street i hear "mister mister!" And the older one was chasing me down the street "you forgot this" im like no thats for you and your sister" and the look in her eyes for 5 bucks was worth a million.
Where is my money
Hey hey hey pesos are currency in Philippines and she ain't a filipina
Salamat.lod
You are an Angel 😇
Your a great guy man
They manager should have only gotten the 2k the lady selling should have got the other 8k
This kid is really doing something amazing.
Bet her boss just took all the money and probably gave her whatever she makes anyways
So beautiful. God bless this man that blessed her. I pray her husband get well soon.. 🙏🙏💙💙
2thousand would help me. We need more people like this...
This is why I chose to be rich because I want to help the needy.
Bro the money went towards the owner of the stand the worker idk probably got something but not what that lady got for her husband … she’s taking money from somone who needs it a little more of course she has a husband like that but if u can have a employee working at ur stand like that then u gotta be making more then the employee
500 bucks is more than I ever gave away (collectively in my life) not to mention to multiple people. Good job, 10 000 pesos makes it sound crazier though.
Give me my 10000 dollars
U owe me $10,000
Do it without filming it, then it's for real
You Probably Made Her Year God Bless You 🙏
We should normalize more videos like this. He’s rewarding people who actually work.
Yo where these people at, fill my bank account bro
That smile is real
Where is my 10k bud
Where’s my 10k?
Run me my 10k I ain’t crack a single smile
✨philipinos✨ (I am not a Filipino)
El: " have a great day" Ella: si 😎😎😎
$10,000 MXN is about $500USD. According to the current Mexican labor law, the general minimum wage is $172.87MXN per day. So he just gave them almost the equivalent of two months of hard work.
I didn't smile... Where are my 10.000$?
Where my money at
You never know what someone is going through
I wanted to see her reaction
Patronising fucker
Great great video, but didn't smile a bit for the 10K
At least there's a few good people left
I am hispanic and this made me cry
Gracias 🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️👌🇦🇺🐨🐨🐨
I love you. So much
Tired of this fake videos
😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
I hope to one day make this huge if an impact
Dam bro I owe you one lol love what you do bro keep it up
Pesos? Philippines or not WHERE IS THIS PLACE?
Hopefully u didn’t get them robbed
You need to be in Mexico instead of being in America. People over there needs help. You’ll also get better content for your YouTube channel because people do need helps.
HÉROE...I admire you a lot 😄 thank you
My parents used to sell at the park and one summer, all my siblings and I would have to go too. Everyday in a town where it would easily reach over 105 degrees F. This was also the case during winter break and on Christmas. I hated going. We'd be there from 11 am to sometimes midnight. The park was in a bad side of town and the restrooms were disgusting. It sucked so much, but my parents couldnt afford a babysitter. If someone had done this, we would have been able to have gone home early, and I know it would have been one of the best days of my childhood. It would have prevented me from spending Christmas tired and cold in a car waiting for my parents to finally decide to take us home.
Touched the heart ❤️
❤️❤️❤️ Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts.
You owe me 10k
Something tells me the lady didn’t get everything man. Mexico has its pros and cons, but when it comes to its people, not even their own government wants to represent them. Very corrupted country, sadly :(
😭😭😭😭😭😭
10000/20 is 500USD and she tried to sell them for 104USD either she still got paid for the week
For anyone who's interested, 10,000 pesos is equal to about a little over $480 american dollars 💵 ☺
This is horrible stop making fun of these people. You going to hook her up just give her the damn money idiot and take the damn camera off of her
It made me smile so pay up...
Film it god damn it
Let’s film them
I’m so proud to be Mexican and the food is the best in Mexico.
You are cringe af
That’s awesome your blessing people brother God bless you! 🙏✝️❤️
The first women didint get bothibg u gave to the boss
Beautiful souls
I want my $10,000
You owe me 10000
God bless this man
Sadly in Mexico most of the time the people that make the sales rent the locations or the stand (food & snacks) they have an owner and the owner rents it out and the worker gets paid like $10 or $20 a day. Mexicans get paid by the week very little compared to anyone in US the minimum wage if they’re lucky to work for a company. If not you have to find you’re own way to survive…Hopefully this helps others understand certain situations…
This is a YouTuber with tons of money and followers I can get behind.  Giving money/blessing to REAL people on the street/in the world.
Great job
isn’t 10000 pesos like 20$ usd?
Every video God sends you to be an Angel
They're thinking "dumb gringo"
Then I guess u owe me 10000
Shes a really good person because everyone who’s been on these have always given him prices way over the amount any non tourist would pay. She said $2000 pesoos or about $100 dollars which is a fair price really awesome on her part. Also I know these things because im Mexican before anyone tries to say anything
Where's my 10 grand? I didn't smile once. I was heart warmed and it was a lovely sentiment and I was touched 😐........you buying it?
Super sweet, but you have to be careful doing this. People saw him give her all that money and could possibly harm her. Especially in a different country. But definitely a blessing.
More people like you are needed in the world !
God bless you brother and thanks 🙏🙏👍👍
You owe me $10000
Need more people like this… if god blesses me with my amc stock investment I will help so many people
That’s how you get followed and robbed an hour later.   Don’t make a show of it in Mexico.  In the us go for it.  Don’t try to flex in Mexico.
Hope what you do real and not a fake doing that for the f view or fame keep going if you legit its fk awesome
I just wish that i could be like you and people around us be like you because of the pain that we are going through right now.
😊
Best. Best. Best.
Everytime my YouTube Shorts start to get lost in the horrible side of the World , one of your vids pop up. Effin beautiful my guy. ❤️❤️
I didn’t smile, where’s my money
Uhh..... 10000 pesos is only $480 in USD....
Leave your camera at home, bet you won’t even let her keep the change.
She said she had to call her boss. Unfortunately she works for someone else and there is a strong possibility she had to turn over part of the extra money or maybe even all of it. Sadly that’s business practices in Mexico - unfortunately. A lot of corruption :-(
So cash or credit?
That fact that she never stops smiling🥰!
Thanks for help people from latam Dios te lo multiplique
Si
Love it man keep it up. Great gesture I’m sure it will be made to good use for years to come
Truly beautiful
Luego dicen los latinos son súper expresivos y agradecidos y la señora ni feliz se puso y nada
I love seeing these type of videos
Yo love to see it bro keep up the good work
I didn't laugh. Really. These videos make me really sad. Someone's said it before me, but this guy has more money than he could ever spend, in a currency that no bank provides. And he throws it away. Throws it away to help others. And it shows that hope is real, that the rich can support the poor. I'm sad because change is possible, and I'm lucky enough to see it. Honest proof.  Man, $10,000 would change my life. Would it change yours?   I couldn't afford to laugh if I wanted to.
I didnt smile. Where my 10k
❤️❤️❤️❤️
*Not your typical tourist that just goes to somewhere to take advantage of the the place and people and/or "retire" because it's nice and cheap* *Thank you for make a difference in the world, a chain of good deeds goes all the way around*
Why do u have to record doing tht tho, ego driven tbh
💘💘💘
Grr☺️☺️
Gonna need my 10 grand there bud
I don't know you name but you the best and I love your show 💛 you best and God bless you my friend
This is very generous nonetheless, but somewhat misleading, 10,000 pesos equates to close to $500 usd.
I wish I was rich, So I can do this everyday.
I didnt smile somehow but thats so sweet
If mr.Beast did this instead of just giving it to his friends i would surely watch his videos more. I mean it would be like donation.
✝️If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,”and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.✝️
Nope, didn't smile where's my money😐😐
Where's My money
Bless you and keep making people smile one day they will be billionaires just in the bendifits of you THANK YOU
Give me my cash
Well you 100% owe me 10K because I didn’t smile definitely heart warming, but didn’t smile I’m holding you up to it craziest part is the fact that if you were being serious about betting the 10k and I got it itd actually help me and my fiancé out so much with our family which will be growing in Sept., but keep up the vids man your an amazing helper in the world
I like ,ya style…🙏🏿
Does posting this make you valid
I swear when people do shit like this the person ends up hating them like "this mofucker be rich as hell who does he think he is smart ass."
NOTHING MATTERS. NOTHING. Think about that. Nothing
Ur a freaking great dude
I love your videos dude
If you want to give people money who need it, do it but don't boast about it by making a video and posting it online. You're basically selling her for views. Shame.
This is so wholesome 💞
Where's my $10,000!!!
Better husband gotten none of the money or food
That is so great  thank you for your kindness
This just makes me sad because it's like certain people are just lucky enough to meet some YouTuber like this guy and help themselves. 99.99% of people still remain.
Prayers for her husband. God bless you all
🥲
I almost thought that translator was a hater when she was like “I don’t understand” I was like SIS HE SAID 10 grand!!!😂😂😂😂😂
I want to me this man and shake his hand for doing something I can't afford to do that but if I ever have the money to do that I'm going to help out as many people as I can in foreign country
.....and now they're all marching across our border(with the help of the coyotes), with the money Americans spend and/or send there. The irony.......
Why are you putting the dollar sign?
That got me a lil emotional at the end, not gonna lie.
I'm so glad you are giving it people who are out there during this hard time
I didn’t smile. Gimme my $10,000
Like I said god bless you brother
Firstly.....Its nice to see a section with no "why record it though 🙄" I can feel how genuine he is☺️
I want my money jit
Big big respect bro
May God’s bless you
Love this guy
Ugh !
Bless you!
You are such a good person. God bless you brotha
Zach, stop making me cry and smell at the same time man. You are crazy wonderful young man. GOD has something special down the rode for you.
God loves you so much
You do what I want to be doing!! This is my absolute dream to be able to do this for people!! We love you!
Appreciate it love seen this 🙏🙏
یه کمکی به ما هم بکن
Cozumel?
Awww
ive literally cryed🥲
I’m so happy people are doing this. I promise if I had this kind of money I would do the same. Whether it’s gifted charity money or money of my own. There are so many hard working and deserving people that need help. What a fulfilling thing to do. Only a few times in my life I’ve had enough money to give what I would consider a substantial amount and I just want to do it again 😫 Keep up the good work buddy!
Love to see it
I didn't smile can I have 10k please?
Bro I need to help all over world poor people plz let me to do
I agreed giving $$ to the peoples who are less fortunate, but are doing everything they can "legally" to earn a living
Thank you. You are amazing for doing these acts of kindness
This inspires me to do the same one day when im financially stable
Imagine he said “husband? I didn’t know you were married” and took the money back lol nah all jokes aside great video
It's awesome you're doing this. Don't forget about the non business owners.
Your a good dude. For real bro keep it up. The 🌎 needs more people like you.....
25 pesos is 1 American dollar btw
Does she serve key lime m&ms
It did not make me smile and you bet me $10,000 I would like my money
Love this stuff
10,000 Pesos equates to $43.75 in U.S.D.
Don’t record it btch do it for yourself
Made me smile, where’s my $10,000? I can sue you right in America🇺🇸??
It would be fucked up if the translater got greedy and fucked up the translation for a few quid herself
Awesome
Nice to see people being helped when they need it.
Made me cry
Thanks for doing what u do it’s amazing !
🥰🤷😍💪
Why are u putting the dollar sign its pessos dont need to $ if you put pesos after
No he gave the owner the money ,the person working the stand did int get shit
He is an answer to these Ladies prayers, I Promise you they Pray for Jesus to bless them, and then this Young Man listens to God’s Voice 🙏🏻🥰
Isnt that only 100 bucks?
I love these. 🥰
These types of Hispanic women make my heart melt 🥺
Bro its 10000 pesos, not 10000💲 doller ok ..🤔 right ??
This is the stuff I would like to do if I have a lot for myself why not share
Oh god, stop with this fake bullshiz
that $ sign is misleading bro But keep doing what you’re doing
Aw man this one got me
Breaks my heart to see videos like this.
Fake
The way that he does  It for views it's  making me feel bad for humanity if he actually wanted to give money to homeless people or something he wouldn't record it
Her husband is very sick but her boss kept most of the money and gave her just a little of it.
Her husband isn’t sick 🤒 lmao xd
The people are similar to Indonesians...
This is one of the main reasons i want to be rich. Just make people happy
Can I have the 10k? I didn’t smile
Believe it or not Mexico is cheap 1 dollar in USA is 24 or 12 pesos there you could literally get a big bag of candy just for 3 dollars
Cross the boarder in san diego....try to get back in to u.s. without getting begged to death by 1000000 poor people that need sooo much help
This touched my heart I pray that your husband is well and I pray that you prosper tremendously ❤️
This is why the mexican culture works so hard. Because it's always about family. God bless you for all the stress that you removed from her and the other vendors this day. May she and the other street vendors and artists, continue to have more blessings.
She said 50 not 25....
Yeah now do that again without recording and putting the video on youtube to make hundred times the amount you spent.
I always wanna do things like this, but in private . Without anyone but the person I’m giving the money to .Bc knowing ppl are greedy, what if I walk away and they jump her for that money.
Good times create weak men. Weak men eventually create hard times. Hard times create strong men Strong men create good times.  *Srong men have barriers amongst people*
This video is heartwarming but you still owe me that 10,000$
They all are working with all their struggles they get up work and even smile . Thanks needed that reminder
You have such a beautiful soul, thank you, truly a gift from God!
I hope the lady selling got the money, not the stand owner. Idk but only say cuz at end it's another lady saying thanks
very nice, nice gesture, considering that her husband is sick, the money will come in handy.
Such a kind person doing nice things for views
Btw 10,000 pesos aren’t even 500 USD… Nice title
💙💙💙💙
That's beautiful 😊
Wheres my 10 grand?
Put the camera down dude.
BEST TIK TOK OF TODAY. YOU ARE HERE ANGEL, MADE HER DAY ❤
What about the actual worker?? Not her boss?
I’m so happy and grateful for people like you ! May your life be filled with joy and happiness! God bless you
This was genuinely beautiful.
When are you giving me the money
Where’s my 10k?
I wonder how much pesos he got from this video…🤔
Love the people of Mexico! Very rich and wonderful culture. Thank you man for doing this
One day, If I become rich, I’ll help the world as much as possible,  make a change like Elon musk and mr.beast
Well, i owe you 10,000. Ive had an angel (Linda)  touch my wife and myself so i know the happieness and relief when one realizes there are GREAT human beings out here!!!

I wish I had that job
Best job in the world
What a excellent 👏 you did. Tell me mam how you earn so much.
This is exactly what i wanna do
She even changed her outfit 😭
Bruh this guy is acting like he is giving so much money but in reality 10,000 pesos is around 450 USA dollars
Coca-cola!!
Broo this is amazing
This is what people need to do.
10,000 pesos is currently around $480
I just hope it's none of those fake ones  But at least it doesn't look fake
It sucks how you can’t trust people in Mexico.. wouldn’t be surprised if she got set up after the recording ended
Awesome
Omg this is so unbelievable beautiful you got a sub man❤️
Call her boss?? Nahh
I live at the phillipenes
You make me smile and cry. That's why i subscribe. Im from Philippines
Very nice and kind of you. Something I would myself if I was fortunate enough to have money like that. However, I did NOT smile, so can I collect on that10,000 dollar bet?

Most of my extended family (on my dad's side) is immigrated from Guatemala, and everybody else is born from them. Alot of my family has a thick Guatemalan Spanish accent, and I'm not sure if you're *in* Guatemala but the accent that they all hold sounds so familiar, it sounds like home to me.
And they say money can't buy happiness
Didn’t smile, 10k pls
You keep making me smile. Stop.
God Bless You 🙏🏼🙌🏼💜✝️. You are making a difference in the lives of so many grateful people 💝
"Have a nice day" -Si
She actually said 50 not 25 at the start😅.....
That’s $481 US not $10,000 US but still really nice of him because over there it’s basically worth just that
Ly Zach
You have your reward
Dude you are amazing for making the world a better place
Pesos means Philippines right?
This is what expatriates living in the United States  should be doing for their people. Thank you for this message!

I liked the concept

Got bkedd
10k pesos is $500 US dollars to be accurate. Still, commendable act 👍
You got a good heart bro. God bless
I respect you, but this is psycopath behavior.
Dude in the pink shirt kinda reminds me of tony montana
Stop recording good deeds
Damn now what if you did this just for the fuck of it and for likes and followers...
Yeah it’s cool but when u got a camera in their faces u distort reality.
nice dude world needs you
Lol, why are you putting the dollar sign when the units are pesos
Zach I love you so much🥰🥰 💗 I haven't been happy for quite sometime now. I smile and laugh on the outside, I'm in customer service 😬 it's an act. When I watch your videos I smile big, and it's genuine. You have the best fans too. Everybody is is so full of love and good energy on your channel 🙏🤗 It's great. Thank you for showing me love onto others and the great things you do. These videos are my happy time to decompress. Love from lonely girl on Cape Cod MA 💜
Mach das doch ohne filmen ich hasse Menschen die denken die müssen anderen Menschen zeigen wie viel Geld sie jemanden geben.
Why are you so beautiful and so nice to the Latin people thank you for being you you are beautiful to my people thank you love you with all my heart you're awesome
25 pesos not 25 dollars if they are charging 25 usd for that they are definitely coming up
Please bless her
I love this ❤
It’s crazy but all us citizens don’t realize that’s pocket nothing over here…..but it’s that same ignorance of not leaving the country and helping where poverty really is…..
Made my day.
All I can think about is how much a peso is
You are a great guy!! God bless you 🙏
Aww bless you
I LOVE It
Godbless you MDMotivator! And all watching and in video!
I hope her husband gets better soon. And thank you for helping those people out ❤️
I love u. U R an Angel.
This guy gives away money on camera then takes it back after the camera stops rolling... all for views
As a Mexican person, that’s amazing. Thank you!!🙏❤️
Come to Houston an support some people
Strong women 💪 go show y’all moms some love
NeXT time only Talk with one Person !!! The Others dont god...
You are amazing. Such great charity.
Degrading Mexicans. Wow
You are saved through faith by being a legitimate child of God (that means stop sinning) and by doing the will of God dont just be a christian and carrying on sinning because you will not enter heaven don't be a slave to sin turn away from sin repent and turn to jesus he died on the cross for you trust in God and have faith believe in christ don't be spiritually asleep become christian before it's too late the rapture is soon. Praying for you all😇🙏 Love your videos 👋
Omfg do something else
Rule #1 don't ever call your boss they'll feel entitled to your tip money also..
480$ for whatever she is selling? That's a bargain
I so much respect for people going out and selling stuff like raspados
I as a normal human I’d love to do this
She wasn’t very greatful
The Bad News- You are naturally a born sinner and have broken at least one of the law (10 commandments) at least once in your life (Example: a lie) (James 2-10 says if you break one of these laws, its the same as breaking them all), so because of this you're on your way to hell already, everyone is (Romans 3-23)  The Gospel (Good News): JESUS, Who is GOD in the flesh, came into the world and died for us, to free us from the curse of the law (10 commandments) and ressurected on the third day so that whosoever BELIEVES in HIM will not perish but have everlasting life!  GOD said this!  GOD cannot lie (Titus 1-2, Hebrews 6-18) we can lie because we are sinners.  JESUS saved us already (Colossians 2-14) Just BELIEVE and TRUST in HIM!  HIM ALONE, anyone who gives you another Gospel, whether an angel or one of us, let him be accursed, like it says in (Galatians 1 6-9) JESUS ALONE! Not religion, Trust in HIM and you will receive the GIFT of THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD HIMSELF! Repent ye and BELIEVE the GOSPEL (Mark 1-15). AMEN!
Spreading the love. ❤️ ❤️
So around 500 bucks?
You and @jimmydarts should collab
I don't usually like watching videos of people doing this sort of thing, but seeing the happiness you brought to these people everytime you're around is nothing short of awesome. Truly awesome.
People say it's bad to film kind acts but idc if it's for good or bad reasons it's amazing to see pure joy and happiness on the unexpecting faces of people
He shouldnt give then to the boss, to the worker is right
Thank you sir. You are amazing.
Love froum india
What if he grabbed one and was like damn these smack ima go take the rest
Beautiful thing mf be confuse when you trynna help them
How fake is this?
Bro you are an angel. I love you and what you do
“Call the boss”. Just gave your charity deal to a slave type boss
I need $10,000 cuhz I didn't smile
I bet you would NEVER do this without recording
The gheto/gully places needs more help than others🙏🏼...........i salute💪🏽 u king🤟🏼  - (her laughter🤣 alone was priceless👸🏻)
You need to learn Spanish bro.
Why do foreign people laugh, there has to be a Mr.Beast out in every other country
Memories are priceless. She will never forget my guy. 💯
Good man
How to speculate on fake charity! If u are genuine u dont film it, you do it and thats it!
It’s sad because the lady that was saleing didn’t get anything if anything the boss got everything
This is so heart warming.
Ok but the First Lady…she was so adorable 🥺🥺❤️❤️
Ur gross bro. Take down the monetization
Just discovered this channel but you’re doing gods work giving to the needy
Bravo Sir!
Blessing
I'm a miserable person. Where's my 10k?
Love it ❤️ x
Bless your heart 🥰 God has sent you them. Mind you, you don't know what they are dealing with in their lives.. bless you 🤗
I Need 10000 also i dont smile i wait For Money thanks
You are a angle bro no one else is there to do that you actually are
Dis the shit I like to see!
That’s about 480 ish US dollars for anyone wondering
Most of these work for cartel btw
Just hope these videos aren't fake
Caint wait until i can make vids like this and more people
When she said he was like as Angel. 💖
Is this Dominican?
For anyone wondering, it's like paying $480.
I wish I could afford to be you. I did for as long as I could. You are a blessing to this world brother.
I love this mani really do but YOUR JUST GETTI MY MONEY BACK WITH ALL THESE VIEWS … your exploiting the moment … HOW BOUT DO STUFF AND NOT RECORD IT WHY DO PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO ?? If it’s from the heart u don’t need approval or notifications
You are like mr beast
The fact he's doing this to people that really need people that live a way different life then us that live in the usa the violence and the government no caring about education is a big problem and sometimes makes me feel like no body that can't do nothing about it but u are such a great person for just giving love sometimes I wish that everybody could have a decent life and people that's more educated wouldn't take advantage of the less fortunate
Todo esta bien menos el hacerlo publico , si haces el bien no lo divulgues buscando admiradores ( everithing is ok but the fact that make a t public is wrong
No se quien eres y no me importa pero miro que ases muchas cosas buenas  ayudando a gente que necesita y eso es bueno primero para ti y la gentes  pero creo  que Dios lo mira bien y el te lo multiplicará
She called him an angel, that’s the kind of live changing stuff I wish I could do for people. I just need the pesos to give them
Alright wheres my 10k at. 😐
How much for the boss
You owe me 10 grand
My God u are a true HERO.
I suppose this is better then most content on the platform and day and age.
How much is 10,000 Pesos in US dollars
Blessings
Here's a fun fact. Your suppose to do kind things and not film it to make yourself seem like a good person.
God bless you man
the scheme to get your money back is us all smiling
U owe me 10 grand
I wanna go to my island and do the same for my people! Mi dushi Curaçao 🇨🇼
Good ol american money.
Legend bro
See, people complain about these videos because they feel someone shouldn't have to record doing something like this, but these people get the money to give out over and over again, because of these videos. Idc how many are made, I will watch every single video of someone giving back, because these are the kind of videos that deserve an audience. You guys are changing someone's life in a min because of these videos, so please, keep making them. And thank you for actually helping people who need it.
She is adorable
These shorts clear everybody’s boredom
$480
Super nice but sadly it was only like 500$ sure it still made a huge difference
You're type wrong type 480$
Really you have a good heart.. u make people smile😀
It's okay to be a good person.  But shaking the system is not always necessarily good.  Think about it.✌
Where's my 10grand
IM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT TALK SHIT ABOUT.. WHY DID HE HAVE TO RECORD HIMSELF DOING THIS FOR ATTENTION🤦🏾‍♂️ BUUTTT WHAT PEOPLE FAIL TO REALIZE IS, IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT I THINK AND AT THE END OF THE DAY ITS A BEAUTIFUL DEED AND THAT MONEY MADE THIS LADY/HER HUBBIES HALF A YEAR🤷🏾‍♂️ AND THAT MY FRIENDS IS THE MORAL OF THE STORY NOT THE (WHY)🤦🏾‍♂️ IM IMPROVING DONT JUDGE😂😂
For the firth time $ is not ₱
Yeah 10,000 pesos, I’m sure that’s nothing like $10,000 US 🤦🏻‍♂️
Your awesome bro god bless your heart 🤘🏼
Omg she looks like the mother of COCO
She's probably worried about the cartel seeing this. Probably something to think about with filming these folks. That's their reality.
Give me my 10 000$
Reminds me of my grandma who passed away years ago. We weren't very rich and she was working and also selling suman. Sadly, her body gave out not from exhaustion but from a stroke. Spent a couple days in the hospital paralyzed until she finally let go. She was also very cheerful and helpful towards other people. The grandma in the video reminded me of my grandma. Such lovely souls.
The thank you in filipino os actually "salamat" but you add the word "po" if the epeson u r talking to is older than u. Ik this coz I am a filipino but we understand gracias tho. But not all ubderstand it. I am also only 9.
God bless all y’all in the video much luv ❤️
I really respect this, not just him giving them double but especially for only taking one thing and leaving her the rest to sell. Its really awesome dude keep it up ❤️
Praise God 👏🏽 🙌 👏🏽 🙌
I didn't smile wheres my money at?
Man I hope her boss didn't talk her into giving all that to him/her and keeping it all to the bosses self
You aren’t doing this for them your doing this for yourself. Otherwise you wouldn’t record it
God Bless him and everyone that love's this clip. ✝️ = 💙
amazing how fast she change her clothes
Great video very wholesome but you now owe me 10k
Didn’t make me smile
Keep it sweetheart just give your boss what HE'S got coming and keep the rest!! It's pennies from heaven!!! God bless!
Always give something to the messenger (or translator in this case) even if it's their work, as long as u pass the money by thier hands u have to bless them a bit.. a lesson in generosity i learnt from a great man
If I ever get call an angel for helping people my eyes will start to water uncontrollably. Shit I ain’t even there and I’m tearing up a bit
❤❤❤
Even if he makes it for fame and for himself, we need more People like him. Because its better to server others than yourself. I Pray that more People think like this.
God bless this man we need more like him
There are tons of people out there, maybe not give so much to people that way you can share with many others and maybe the older folk
I’m giving that much money and an ass clap from the back for sure.
How is nobody talking about how she had to call her boss and the boss took the money not the lady actually doing the work selling them....
Zach is the best, this channel is worth more then gold and silver
Why he give it to the boss an not the worker I doubt that lady standing out there all day seen any of that
She said 50 not 25 at the beginning lol
God bless you🙌
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
Really stoned and it’s late where I am so I did not smile gimme my 10k
shooo I bet you 10,000 you’ll make me smile lol I’m broke!
Love her.  What a sweetie ❤️
This lady is amazing! Bless her heart 💜. Also, for everyone that u made smile by watching ur vid, u should give that money to one of ur deserving people in the vids since none of us who have smiled won’t get it.
She says $50 not $25.
Give me my 10000$
💖👍😁💖
🥰🥰🥰🙏🙏🙏🙏
I honestly didn't smile but it was very kind of you to do that
25 pesos = 1 USD ish
Recording good deeds is the new vibe I guess, helping people is what matters most
Watched the video and didn't smile. Will that be cash or check?
that money is going to the boss or the mob ....
Wait the first lady didn’t get anything??? And you just gave it all to the owner? I would of made it even to both because the First Lady probably feels horrible for not getting anything from you.
Dang I'm out of $10,109.99
If people don’t know 10,000 pesos is 500$ in US pretty much.
These people needed it more than you know. Thank you for such kindness ❤️
love this guy
$10k Pesos is about $500 US.
Watched this with a straight face I need that 10k my boy
This makes my heart smile.
Didn’t smile where’s my 10k
Didn't smile... nearly cried
You owe me 10k ngl nice video tho bro
Thank you so much and yes you are an angel 🙏
Fake
love these vids
Really enjoyed seeing this. Social media tends to always put the negative in your face. It’s refreshing to see something genuinely NICE.
Good Good
Shorts are Amazing 🤩
Wait, so did you just pay the boss and not the woman working her ass off?
The love you show to others is remarkable, very few people have a soul as kind as yours.  Thank you for all that you do man!
wait so he gave it to the boss???
I would have bought it all for 2,000. Then directly give her the 8,000. Boss will take the whole thing.
The owner took that money that's some bullshit  that lady got nothing it went to her boss
Ur the man
Que dios te bendiga
She said sincuenta which is 50 pesos
❤️💞💝
Him:Gracis
Gimme 10,000$ rn
You need to stop betting if you're not going to pay up
Give money to someone who really needs it not the people who alredy working bro
I owe me 10 K I didn’t smile but I was happy for ber
Finding actual people in need! I love it! Not just donating to an organization not knowing what happens with your money. It made me smile that’s for sure!
Just make a donation and stop filming it
I like this guy.
I see a 1WALDO store on the back that's like DOLLAR TREE or 99+ stores in the US
I want to go do this
Name of music?
This is Mexico?
where’s my money bro…  i didn’t laugh or smile…  where’s my fvcking money bro…  i’m not fuckin’  playin’….
God and Jesus Christ please bless this man, her, and her husband🤍🙏🏾.
I love you man! 😃
I think he means 2000 pesos not $2000 lol how much does he think elotes are???
And that is the story of the gringo angel
I didn't smile, I'll send you my PayPal?
You deserve like 👍 god give you more because you help mean people
Canadians being nice has been takin to a whole new level.
Making someone's smile is the best thing you can do 😊🤗
Her smile and laugh so precious
Awesome bro keep it coming Bless bro 😎
Give me my 10k
If youre american in a southern country like this you should definitely do this. Its like $100 to us but to them its like a million in pesos
I guess if you keep giving away money eventually you're gonna get a good one!
First I thought this is in Philippines
Bro, whoever you are, I would love to experience this with you one day. I want to go back to Mexico. It's great helping the people over there. You're doing great. I'll pay for my own ticket on the bus.
You are a gift from God! Thank you for being a good human
Awww that's like paid vacations for them!🥺
they're good people in this world just do an extraordinary wonderful things for people my God bless him on his journey as well.
Wheres my money?
Where my money at?
I didint smile, now give me the money
😢
Mexico and other third world countries are so poor it’s sad how ungrateful we really are towards the things we take for granted.
She is worried about the Camera man's husband, "your husband is very sick"
This video is a little fucked up. You gave the money to the owner when you were willing to give the money to the employer. When she probably needed the money too. 💔
God bless you always so much kindness 🙏🏼❤️✝️
so awesome
Loved your comment too what awesome person
Great guy..
The boss wanted that cash 💸
Imma be honest, my uncle used to be a vegetable seller and as soon as he saw a white person woth a camera he instantly knew to play the poverty angle the whole living in a small house with ten people only one working ect. Not saying thats whats happening here but that might be low key whats happening here
Complete virtue signaling.
Didnt she play in two and a half men?
Now that it did not made me smile, where is my money?
Ok where my 10k?
This made me subscribe thank you for paying it forward to the Latino community!!!
Awww that's is amazing.. it's so nice when people get help who truly deserve it.. wow I love this ❤
Man I like this guy and what he’s doing! God Bless this guy! Keep blessing him so he can continue to bless others that are not so fortunate!!!
BRAVO!
Great editing.😂
“money can’t buy happiness”
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Keep up the good work
Her boss kept most of the money.
Next time show us the goddamn food. I'm hungry now
I wish she kept the money and not her boss
He was giving the money to that lady and the boss just came and took it and thought it was for her ???? Like what
So  you gave the owners $10,000, not their employee 😔
You are a great person <3
I mean he is an angel
Heck yeah bro your a freakin g
blessings
Where is my 10k??
Salamat,that means thank you and mabuhay
Hoping the worker got a piece of that not just the stand owner
Is this colombia or maxico. Because it's either 3 dollars or 500 dollars
Her laugh was sweet as honey. Yes, it is incredible. God bless each and every one.
im still not smiling, so where's my money?
That’s not $10k its pesos, thats about $500. But good enough it’s still a lot when you need it
Where is my 10000
This is why good people deserve money ❤ ahem ahem 😂
I gave a young waiter in a Mexican hotel $20 USD last week. She almost cried… hits home hard
amiigooo thank you so mich
I love your humanity and love for ppl and their happiness. You are an amazing person💙
I’m a little confused.  The lady at the end isn’t the woman he wanted to give the money to.  Was that the boss?
Good man. You make hard working people happy.
this mans is goated
I the world had just more people like u
I love that you bless these people the way that you do. God bless you and your family sir.
Reverse Gary Vee
Eyes what are you doing?Why are you tearing ?Stop it dammit! Love your heart
Damn the boss keeps everything
I hope the boss blessed the worker..because she's just been blessed
Why do you to this.
This guy is clout chasing just do it with no camera 📷
Soon blessed
Holy shut this is a jump im  at $13,010
You giving it to her boss not to her. She's a worker and the 10k you have her the boss pockets it.
Well I didn't smile... so pay up
I love your work. Shocking people.. may your pockets never run dry.
Aawww❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’d love to see their reactions a little more 😋
I really enjoy your videos I’m from honduras 🇭🇳 but I live in USA I really want you to go to honduras and do one of this videos 🙏🏼 if you need a translator as well I’m available at anytime 💯❤️💪🏻
You owe me 10000 dollars cuz I didn't  smile =
Man you are really out here doing god's work, keep it up.
Always dropping off some love to support the channel that supports all these great people, respek bro
25 pesos is actually 1 dollar and 5 cents
That woman literally saw an angel at the right moment. 😊 these are the videos we need more of
I’d be getting more than a taco
Watch who’s around when you give out the money
This made me tear up instead of smiling.. where’s my 10k?
Wonderful
Ah bro you should have gave what the boss said and then told her alone you’d give her the rest. The boss prob took most of that from her
The dollar sign is for dollars... not pesos.. wtf
Love these!
Love to see you spreading love here in PDC 😎🥰
Those ladies are so hard working. You really are like an angel to them. I don't think you have an idea of what you're even doing for them by doing this. Probably more they made their whole lives. God bless.
🤲🕌☝🕋❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
GOD bless.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ God bless you!
Bro that's a blessing u are a good man
*gives 100,000* always copy good actions also u won the bet I smiled 😃
Love these videos
This man was angel to then 🤲❤🇵🇰
I want my 10k
Kindness just what the world needs.
Bless u
That just feels so good!!!!!
People say a good deed doesn't need to be filmed.  Well I'm tired of seeing divisive and negative content.  This is the stuff that should be going viral.  Thank you for doing what you do.
Prayers to her husband and she's an icon of a strong woman. 💪 God bless her....
She was probably beaten and robbed after he went away
Sir I’m pastor Benjamin I’m  educating 139 kids free education kindly join in helping
pesos not $
Where's my 10000$?
Do the same stuff in the states , dude ....
I can’t get enough of these videos. Knowing how much these amounts can change their life for the moment is so beautiful
Respect brother ✊ keep us Hispanics welln
Where are my 10k?
Very true, thank you very much for treating the people of my country (Mexico) like this ❤️
Instead of giving her $1.25, he gave her $500
That is $484 USD. Nice.
Beautiful people of God..Good is God..God is good
Its really nice what you do here, but you now owe me $10k bro!
Just to clear the record 10,000 pesos is about 500$ USD ❤️
Watching this makes my heart happy, thank you for making my day❣️
These won’t ever get old. Pay it forward
The kindness is nice but I really hope it's genuine and not a continuous fad for views.
Idk if ya noticed but he didn’t help the vendor at all he gave the money to her boss 😅 he should of gave the boss the 2000 for the product and the lady who sells the 8000 cuz now the boss gets 10000 and 2000 more of the products
How wonderful for this lady with the sick husband.  You took some worry off this lady's mind. That's the good stuff.
Put smile on my face made me realize how blessed I am 🙃🙏
God bless God bless God bless you my man that's all I can say you are the man God bless you and your family keep doing what you're doing if you got it if I had it I do the same thing but at least you're doing something good again God bless you man
I love seeing people that have money give it to people that really need it's really good to see sometimes that they are good people in the world
I really hope this is real this is really really nice
Thank you for being so kind. I actually work with quite a few Hispanic people from all over and especially if you make friends with these people, they will make sure to take care very good care of you as you are no different whatsoever. They definitely dont see much kindness in my part of the US. Ive even picked up some spanish and 98% of the people here dont bother to learn a word other than food.
This is the kind of stuff I'd do if I had a ton of money.
Her husband is sick and still smiling soooooo amazing to sell everything
Not her counting the money
Good job bro god bless you❤️🙏🏻
Mexico😃😃.. You really are helping bro ....fuck mexico's economy and politicians
Be humble without the camera's
i love this guy for doing what he does, by doing this you’re helping not just her but her whole family it’s really amazing man
Grateful to watch such kindness
Soooooo good!! Her smile says a thousand unsaid words!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️
Don’t tell them to call the bosses they will take a cut
Amazing
Handle
Filipino love bro me too😚
Shes so sweet
U make me want to do what u do bro I wanna help. The way you do I would like to know how I can make the world 🌍 a better place like u are
Where my damn money at my boy run em pockets
Thats stupid, no wonder that stranger want always more and more, for no work. You should have problems, then you know what your silly words are doing. Its easy to give money that not belong to you. So stop this stupid behaviour ...😡👎sure that this woman like to get more money if her husband is ill, then you could go everywhere and ask people if they want money for free. My husband to be is in golf of Mexico needs money to leave ther , but his exchief dont want to let him go..that's like kidnapping..kidnapping is everywhere forbidden, that should somebody tell ...Douglas Smith...😡👎😡👎😡👎😡👎 cheaters are all over the world.
Awkward as fuck
Giving these people this money can be the worst thing for them and also the best thing. I think regardless of that minor fact it’s in the best interest of the content creator to keep it up. What else could he possibly do to spread happiness as well as make content in his travels?
How does this guy make money when he gives it all away ??
Can't really understand the currency ahahahs is it a dollar or a pesos, anyways you're so kind man. God bless you and your family!
is that realy five humdred pesos the real color of five hundred pesos is yallow i think its fake
Thank you Jimmy thank you from the  bottom of my heart to yours darlin'... husband very sick and you are helping..I feel God's Holy Spirit in you Jimmy 🙏 ❤ 💕 💞 🫂 🤗 👐 🫂 🤗 👐
I love you so much bro
What country this is?? I heard pesos????
Don't mean to ruin the mood, but I think it's definitely strange that she has a boss. I visit Mexico multiple times a year and have even lived there, so I understand the culture, and I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that in this situation, she would be her own boss. There are many people, especially children, that are basically forced to sell things on the streets (gum is pretty popular), people feel bad for them because they're just trying to make a living, but then it turns out that most of the money goes to whoever is forcing them to work. Again, I'm not entirely sure if my theory is right, but I've been seeing people do this as a trend and I think it's important to inform yourself where that money might end up before giving out so much.
Wow this makes ne almost cry If iam ever rich iam gonna do this too Bless youre soul
Farming views nice bro
You are heaven sent!
Thank you for help on the Filipino 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I am so confused why does he append ‘$’  to Pesos? Isnt Mexican Pesos a currency in itself??
I hope she shared some with the working lady.
Have a great day!!!! *YES* 😄
Making a difference in peoples lives for views, anyone supporting and following this guy are scumbags. I hate seeing this pop up in my videos
making my people happy, god bless u <3
Epic
Literally the best videos keep this up Frfr man you got everyone’s support
🙏🏽💜✝️💜🙏🏽!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is the kind of life I'd want to live  Just chilling with enough money to make somebody's whole month while living my life 😌
God Bless You.
I wanna be doing this one day
Happy woman ❤️❤️❤️
Was that not a totally different lady he hugged at the end?
These videos always make my day.
But the First Lady wasn’t the one who kept the money ? Did they split it or what ? You asked the worker to keep the money not the owner of the stand so can you explain what happened bro ? Please
Hey you are a great Man
1 thousandth comment
Didn’t smile where’s my money
Beautiful Earth Angels 😇
That was awesome thanks
Damn bro this hit home god goin bless you even better g🙌🏻
This man is the best, he does the thing like. How much is everything? And then he gives 5x more than that. And when they think he is gonns get everything he just "nah, imma take only this one". Amazing bro.
I need 1000$ , I am in Problem 🥺.
I like how she showed you the actual currency pieces it's worth... If I was not a local, this would be a great help.
I love how you go down there and just flex on these illiterate povs. Throwing cash at them like a B team stripper on a Tuesday. Making it rain for the roaches!
Thanks for helping this people in need
You owe me ten bars.
Humans doing great things,  no angels needed
MY MAN HELPING MY FILIPINO PEOPLE. RESPECT

When someone would call me a angel i would never forget that
Angels are real
Sheesh I thought she is Filipina damn..   Very confusing as I can understand some part and the rest is idk
I’m a 46 yr old contractor, watching this in the Home Depot parking lot , w tears.   I hope my startup takes off so I can do the same.  I promise I will.
He should have millions of likes not the cringe videos .
W bro i’m subbing
You are amazing ❤️🙏🏻 bless you and your love one’s 🙏🏻❤️
Bless you! This is what I want to for a living
this dude a real life angel from heaven
Watching these for 30 min straight and I can’t stop smiling now. Great videos man
Ameeeeeen ✝️✝️💞💞🙏🙏💞💞✝️✝️
Dam I just lost 10,000 because it dam sure made me smile
Does he know that her boss is gonna keep that money right ? She’ll just get the money she made profit from selling her snacks 😏
More of these videos please.
Thank you brother, you inspire me to do good. God Bless you, stay safe and healthy from Jakarta 🙏
I cry my eyes out every time I see a different one of these. Whoever is behind this is changing some things.  You wanna know how I am so sure? It's made me change. It's gave me a different outlook on a lot of stuff.  And I've already been told at work I have been different lately and more positive.  So even though I'm miserable and dying inside, nobody is getting that guy at my job anymore.  I used to be a dick for no reason sometimes.  Just to do it. I guess where I'm so down, I wanted to bring others down too. Idk why. That dude... he's gone. He passed on. He died months ago. Thank you. Now,  I'm still the same as I ever was, don't get me wrong. But I keep that inside and to myself. I can't control my depression, the sadness.  But nobody needs that negative crap from me in their life. I'm ashamed I was doing that. I used to give my aunt shit for doing the same and I realized I was doing it also. Ugh. Thank you again. You ARE an angel, where/whoever you are.
That laughter is so adorable
Thank you bro from SA.. God bless you.. King
I swear you make my days so much better I’m not in need but it makes me appreciate everything I have an my kids
Wait how is this explained in tax like surely a random 10,000 pesos at a market stand is gunna raise questions lmao
King
Really see the good helping all those hard working people it's really great to see
Aw 🥲
Bruh literally doing what I wanna do when I get a lot of money but see I’m anti so I can’t record it I’ll jus do it
❤❤❤❤
I love you man. I spent 5 years homeless in Portland and I can tell you when a stranger pulls up with a new pair of shoes, dry socks, and some food it's not only Christmas but it gives you faith and your taking that to new extremes. Tha k you.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Man BLESS U FOR WHAT U DID !! AND MAYBE DOING !! KEEP IT REAL MAN !!!
You are so nice bro. All the LOVE of the world 4 u.
I try to not smile for 10k but i dint smile where my 10k but i still smile on my mind man
They thinking gringo muy loco. It's all good.
I love seeing these videos every morning @MDMotivator you are an amazing person and loving my dream <3 i wish nothing but to help the people who struggle
Something tells me that pesos in Philipines and this country are the same
Such lovely people what country is it   ?
Pienche ingles mas cagado 😂😂 "chi tol me tank yu vary mach"
Youre a good dude man !
Hi sir. I hope you could give me 10k pesos. I will buy a freezer for my store. Im unemployed. Hope you notice me. 🙏
Dude go Afghanistan or those poor countries
God blessed you 🙏🙏🙏
This guy is making a difference
❤️
Frigggin daft !!! Do you REALLY think her BOSS will allow her to keep the money 🤣🤣🤣
Love it
Why all ur videos are based on filipinos?
Really awesome bro...but i was kinda wondering.... did you give anything to the interpreter? Cuz that's patentially hella awkward... hehe
And how is it we can get ahold of u to tell u that u lost
Wonder who got the tip in the end
I hate you but I like you man
Wish the world was like this
wow god bless you my brother for helping others 🙏 thumbs up 👍
Cease to amaze me keep spreading joy and kindness, do it for all of us
This is content
You know, my Dad when he was alive, helped so many people. He gave 100's of 1000's and Noone knew.He literally changed lives.  I've given too, Noone knows.  No YouTube, no announcement. Do this without monetizing  or building a channel and without anyone knowing. I don't buy this. Read about Warrick Dunn if you want to see true giving with no gain.
You owe me 10k 😐
Truu I like that
God bless you  and your family bro for helping my ppl I also help ppl in the way I can when I can ....
God bless you brother
Mexican Currency And Philippines Currency is Same
😍
THANK YOU FOR HELPING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE THEY HAVE BEEN IGNORED FOR A LONG TIME FOR OVER 500 YRS NOW
God moments
Super
love this video and guy. Godbless you!
Making the world not as dark as it is .
I love your video so much, it's always made my day. Keep it up, love you too
This type of content inspires me to someday give back to others who are against all odds facing situations in life ❤️
I fucking love this guy 🥺
I love your channel so much I watch every single video you put out and I promise I have a smile on my face every time, one day ill help someone like you do 🙏❤️
We need more men and women like this guy things would be so much better
Wow. Like fr! It has been my dream to do this in Mexico and Jamaica. My parents are Mexican immigrants living in the US so they raised us to give back how we can. My family is known for giving a little extra where ever we go. Telling people to keep the change and giving my family "tips" for anything. In the mist of seeing everyone's daily struggles I promised myself that when I'm capable, I will try to create jobs for them that are reliable and they can live comfortably. Showing kindness and giving back to the community is something that I would love to do the more income that comes my way.
Aaawesome!!!
It’s amazing and nice but I wish the lady running the stand got the money and not her boss. Or I hope her boss split the money with her the lady running the stand is probably hurting more.
Wholesome ass content be the best.
Much love from Mexico my guy, appreciate what your doing for the community. Always wanted to be able to go back to the mother land and do the same but just not finically able to give money away right now. Thank you for being you and doing what you do. God bless ✊🏽
Do this and don’t record it bro for real. You’ll still be angel to these people but it seems like you’re just doing it for credit
That's not the same person that he approached to get the money?
Just found this page ❤️❤️❤️
- Have a great day - Si  😂😂😂😂
Thank you
So who got the money? The worker or the owner???
That’s around 500 bucks for anyone wondering
Man you vey good man.
She's so adorable what a wonderful woman and this man is an angel doing great work for people in the community!!
You're just showing off.
They're like that mom's on Disney movies. Bless you sir, bless more life ☺️
I told u where a god to every one no matter who it is u out a smile on there face that is a good felling I no when I help some one it makes me fell good. We all need a angle.
This man's the mini beast
May the Lord continue to bless this young man to bless others
Love this!!
Me just knowing 1 day I'll get the chance to the same.
Keep doing you and stay blessed brother Sky's the limit ✊
Well I hope you got 10k laying around if you know what I mean
Shout out to you brotha!
One love
God Bless you brother you are a kind and influential man. You inspire me to do better.
You know people like this, makes a grown man CRY! To know there are still people in this world, who still have a HEART gives the world HOPE!
Keep doing this…expect nothing in return…just be a good person…God bless
God bless you for doing this man. It is a beautiful act of kindness!
What happened to the smiling lady in the blue apron at the beginning?   why did the lady in the white blouse take the money...is she the owner? Was the money meant for the laughing lady or the other lady in white blouse? Who got blessed and does Jimmy know who the money went to?  I would like to know Jimmy.
These street vendors are just really sweet people
Best content, man. Seriously. I love it. Thank you for doing this!
Dude,you are a GOD SEND to everyone you touch!! Salute bro!!!💯💪🏾🙌🏾❤️👍🏾

Bro I love you man God bless you 🙏 ❤️  bro your doing great things keep blessing people man its never in vain. Especially woman in south America your amazing
Hard not to like these videos
Que dios los bendiga.
I wish people like you existed around my part.  Going through the hardest part of my life and I can’t even get extra work because nobody is willing to help.
Whats the Cartels %? 🤫
10,000 pesos is 500 bucks usd
You're so kind and good heart.thank you for making people happy.thank you thank you and thank you
This guy is awesome !!!   Thanks bro for what you do and for those you help
Next time I'm going on holiday and I'll do this too!
When mr beast dies or goes bankrupt we’ll have him and man, this dudes pretty damn awesome
This is the same guy as the other video, is this fake?
this is the kind of person i wish i could be i wish i could give
Shouldn't it read $486.00..... That's approximately 10,000 pesos
She said his husband is really sik
Love this!!!
Call me cold hearted and you'll be wrong..I love these videos ...but I'm still not smiling homie...$10,000 is what u bet on it...and I'm homeless ...don't hate me for this...
Where’s my 10,000 dollars
Always a sob story though
I love this, dont ever let a language barrier stop you from being a Saint in someone's life
I love these videos. 💯👌
😭
My turn?
What country and state is this? (Sorry I'm new to this world)
Deselo a la trabajadora no a la duena. give it to the worker not the owner
Do it w out the camera man
YOU, ARE THE DEFINITION OF HUMAN KINDNESS... I.... HOPE YOU, ARE THE REAL DEAL AT WHAT YOU, DO...
🙏
As you see, most of the money dosnt even go the people themself. They also have bosses that most of the time get most of the money
That would be Soo awesome to be able to out and about and do that for people.
I love random acts of kindness. So beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
I’m a bit confused 🤔  Did nobody check that he gave the 10.000 to the boss and not to the cheerful, lovely, laughing lady that is standing there the hole day. Working hard for her boss to sell all this things. I don’t think the boss doesn’t deserve it but I hope she shared with her honest worker. Who didn’t just take the money and kept the rest but called her. May her soul be blessed. May the bosses husband get healthy.
I know the First Lady! About 7-8 years ago her shop was set on fire by some teens then along came an angel like yourself and helped her rebuild
This made my day
i didnt smile
This guy is an actual Angel.
This lady seems so sweet genuinely I don’t really like these videos cause I think they’re fake but I like her beautiful attitude
Yo, I know you probably won’t see this comment. But in the off chance that you do please keep this up. You’re making peoples lives better. You bring happiness an joy everywhere you go. You’re a good dude. Got a good heart.
I love these videos. They're so wholesome and heartwarming. 💓
You owe me $11619 now please stop making these bets. Or maybe just finally pay me.
I will be doing this one day very soon.  ;-)🙏🏽🕊
Well i just watch this vid and sever others and they didn't make me smile just made life seem worse id like my $10,000 now.
Damn
You are blessed
🤣🤣🤣😥😥😥
Bro from Morocco to Canada big love and don't give up God is happy for the things u do and I have a wife from Mexico I'll share with her this
Always the same People. This is a fucking fake.
Bro  Imi love you my brother  Thank you for helping my people out in the struggle You are an angel
This made me cry bro . Ur doing Gods work ...... Nice job
Bro Mexicans are really superstitious and have so much faith I don’t think you know how thankful they are. It’s crazy I guarantee you that in there eyes they really do see you as an angel please don’t stop doing this 💯💯 I can’t wait until I’m in the position to do this 💯🤞🏻🙏🏻
Thats the type of stuff I want to do
Fuck yeah !!!!!!!! I love you !!!!! Some people need it !
We need more people like you . You can be rich by collecting all of em but you're becoming rich from your heart ❤
Good man. Excellent karma tho !
I would love to be able to do this. I would love if it happened to my family. God Bless this man for doing this for soany hard working people who just needed to catch a break.
Sweet hardworking women
The man
Make sure the money stays with the employees and not the ruthless owners of the business.
There were to different woman ? The one fr b4 didn't get it
Oh I love these ppl...and you for brightening my day...! God bless you beautiful ppl..
These seriously make me so happy to see, bless you sir
Thank you my friend, I encourage everyone to do this, people in South America work really hard and sometimes they just make $10/day. It doesn’t take much to change someone’s life.
I’m just curious to know why put the dollar sign if it’s in pesos? You’re throwing the audience off with amounts you show
May God bless u, ur holy family, the holy lady & her holy family immensely🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
Legend 👍
Enjoy your  shows
I fuck with you man. Good shit ✊🏽
Thank you for showing the world your light in the darkness
Is that in Mexico
You are so amazing!!💝 May God bless you all and your loved ones and have a blessed day, night and life!✝️💝
Blessings to you ❤ for making her day!!
💜💫Gratitude💫💜

Husband is very sick si jahajaj se echó una caguamas anoche y anda bien crudote!!! Very sick!! Jajaja
Song ?
This guy is a saint

You should never let your right hand know what your left hand is doing. If you truly wanted to change the world with these types of acts, why even record them? Who benefits from that? You....
Humanity restored instantly God bless you all and heal the husband 📖🛐💪🏽🙏🏽💙💙💓💓
These are the best!!!
Continue to help people but stop putting this shit on youtube.....
Esa señora se parece a la que dice aquí hay señoritas dis que señoritas 😂🤣😂😂😂la tía
Love
I love Mexican women.  They are a team player
😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇among us💞💞
I smiled, 10k please.
It would make me smile if you were doing it in the US where $10k actually means $10k and not $50....
She’s so honest she did not want to take the money even called her boss 😢
🙏❤

This might be the only time I appreciate someone recording n posting their good deeds. Idk why but this is really dope that u do this man. Real shit this is great. 👍🏽👏🏽👏🏽
At the first Part of the video I don't get it.. Is The '25' Pesos Or US Dollars? Because if its $25 then She Tried Ripping you but if its 25 pesos then Nah.. But Still you gave her 10k pesos So It's no Big deal Now.. But Thank you for being Generous
Bro, thanks for doing this kind of stuff in my country, Mexico.  Theres not too many people that do this. Youtubers are usually dumb and just do stupid videos. But this is so wholesome that i don't have the words to describe it.
Bless you bro. No doubty fav person on the internet. No B's. 😢
I AM PROUD TO BE AN ISRAELITE LIKE THESE CENTRAL AMERICANS..WE HAVE EXCELLENT SENSE OF HUMOR AND HARD WORKING ETHICAL PEOPLE...TOO BAD SATAN HATES US ISRAELITES !!!😅😂🤣🇵🇷💃

This is what more fortunate people need to be doing, going to up and developing countries and bringing nnot just opportunities to others but smiles and a future. Not those youtubers/tik toners who already have it all but throw away food or money
I'm not smiling dude, where is my 10k buckaroos?
Sorry this video didn’t make me smile
God bless you …men !!!
Awesome 👍
Bro u are an amazing person God bless u God will bless u with more
I’m still waiting on my $10,000 from the last bideo
Is 10,000 pesos equal to $10,000?
People who do great are Angels!
Respec my brother
I lost the bet but don’t have $10,000 to give you for losing it 🙁 but thanks anyway for the amazing videos and always putting a smile on my face. Much love ❤️
10,000 pesos is about 500 in dollars
Good job bud
Latin people are hard workers and if they all stopped working the usa would starve.
Are you at Philippines??
I forgot about the title and found myself smiling at the very last moment before the video ended. Dang it, it's so touching. Wish I was wealthy enough to do this, but we are all blessed with something to give, and it doesn't have to be money. Simply being Americans gives us privilege, because so many people in other countries live below the poverty line, but most Americans are middle class workers. While we don't have much, what we have is already more than what others have. That's why sponsoring children for $40 a month can change a child's life, as well as their family's. Not only are you providing for their schooling, their basic health needs, and nutritious food, but you also have the chance to write to your sponsored child and send them pictures of you and your family so they can get to know who you are personally. You wouldn't be a faceless benefactor, but a friend.
Yours is the only channel I believe does this  only out of love of helping others and not for clout or attention. 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Bagus masih ada orang yang begitu perhatian dengan sesamanya, tp semoga bukan untuk pencitraan
You owe me 10 grand
Alright, you owe me $10,000
Hey you said I'll bet you $10,000 you will smile I didn't smile so that means you owe me $10,000     Jk lol
This guy doesn’t discriminate against anyone and he just gives back not wanting anything in return. Respect  and I hope you get the blessing you deserve
I've been seeing your videos for about a month. I really need financial help man! Please reach out. God bless.
So he gave 10000 pesos to The owner not the employee Damn i hope she gave her a cut
Hopefully that won't go to her boss.
🙏🏼🙌🏼bless them all
The people are so sweet and honest. The lady who was translating was like "but this is the total" and that first lady's laugh and smile are so infectious. My anxiety has been horrible today for no reason...but I'm glad I stumbled upon your videos, they really have helped me take my mind off my worries. Love these people.
This dude owes me 10k
Your such a lovely man god 🙏 has blessed you 💕💕💕💕🙏🙏🙏🙏
You are f****g AMAZING 👏 GOD BLESS YOU ❤
wheres my money
This one didn't make me smile but, I have watched a bunch of your videos and smile a lot. You make me want to cry....I my self try to help ppl. I'm struggling a lot right now but it makes me feel so blessed to do what I can. God bless you you are an angle. May my angle Michael wrap you in his wings and protect you. Sincerely, Shauna
Did the vendor get it?
I ain't giving shit and so is 99% of this comment section lmao. Stop the bs "I wish I could do that" or "you're changing lives", go give a spare 100 bill to a flower seller or windows cleaner on the streets.
So was the second one a diffrent one? Or did something happen🤔
You must get so much enjoyment out of that . I know I do . 👍
I dont want$10.000 ,just give me $1000 ..im not smile because it not touch my heart..come on..pay me man..
im the new owner of $10,000
I need 10,000 dollars now💵💸
I didnt smile...
God Bless you for the kindness you do for everyone!! 🙏👼❤⛪🕊👍🙌
Beautiful!!! She's right. You are an angel. I've seen many of your videos and along with the money you give people love, respect, joy and peace of mind. God bless you.
You own me like 200k at this point
This man has done this for so many people who are in need. God bless your good heart sir. I sincerely mean that.
This was the moment he found out that he has a sick husband that he never knew about😂
Wheres my 10k
I bet 10k this doesnt make me smile
This is amazing she’s so happy, it would be nice having a translator but the message got across
I love the kindness you spread
rich show off - don't need to video your 'donations' :P
Thanks for the smile.
imma need that 10k by next week buddy. A deals a deal.
Thank you Jesus for your kindness 🙏 ❤
My man needs to learn Spanish ASAP
She’ll probably get robbed by the cartel warlord that runs the town
You get me crying
I try n like every video this man makes 2 help him keep doing this.. I just hope the 1st lady got money as well, because rember she said she had to call the boss
I didn't smile where's my money😐
The one thing that is crap about this is, the “boss” who wasn’t the old lady who stands there the whole day and every day, got all the money… So the money went to the wrong person… it should have gone to the old lady that sold and not the “boss”
I’m confused that was two different ladies, the lady at the beginning isn’t the same person he gave the money to?
This guy going around asking for prices for all and i still ask for a single item and thinks about buying it or not. Youre got good soul my man. May you get richer so you can help all the people
This guy is a literal angel walking in human body. Stop vlogging bro, just go to the sky. Youre doing too much here 😂
I'm gonna start doing this, obviously on a smaller level.
Really well done brother. Lord of the Worlds bless you and guide you
You own me 10 bands
You owe me $10,000
That'll be $10,000. I cried.
The best youtuber
All of you videos make me cry. You are so amazing. Truly. You are a life saver. As someone who struggles greatly financially I know how much things like this can change someone's life. I currently live in a 2 man tent. I had a portable shed but was destroyed by falling limb luckily I was just bruised but alive I got a tent from a coworker but it was flattened in recent snow storm they day it was flattened I tried to turn down a $50 tip (hotel housekeeper) from a family displaced by fire I REFUSE to take tips from displaced guests but she insisted told me it was a blessing to be able to bless me I found out that night my tent was flattened and was able to use the tip to buy "new home" I cried cried & cried my living situation & health problems cause me to have suicidal thought daily I always try to go out my way to be kind cause you never know what someone else is going through. Thank you for being a kind human being. You bring a glimmer of happiness to my day💛💛💛
I bet u a dollar you cant bring an xbox series x to this adress
I kept a straight face 😐    I love your videos keep up the good work ❤️

You are awesome
THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION—Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, lusted (Which Jesus said was adultery in Mt. 5-28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there’s good news, Though we broke God’s law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross. “God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes (trusts) in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (Jn. 3-16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  if you’ve made it this far, please, repent and trust in Jesus and what he did for you on the cross. You have a promise from the God who cannot lie that he will forgive every sin you’ve committed or ever will commit and grant you everlasting life as a free gift.
this man is really mr best but less loud
That laugh of the lady made me smile!   What is you’re real name MDMotivator? You are amazing! Thanks for sharing these videos with me, you make my day ❤️
Man you didn't give me the 999$ you better give me the 10000$
i hope these ppl really get the money...its not going to a cartel or other 'handler'.
We need more people like this in the world

My wish is for money to not be a big deal.   Every one of us could do this and we would have the most amazing world.
You been in Mexico for a min 🤔
Love you Zach. Thank you for being man.
dude you keep what little faith I have left in humanity alive , cheers bro , keep being real
Please keep doing this
i would do things like this.. but im broke
I wonder if the owner who received the money shared it with her employee, the lady from the beginning of the video. All in all, this is so kind and is a great reminder of how much we take for granted. Thank you for helping so many wonderful people, it truly warms my heart!
❤️❤️❤️❤️🦋
He doing great deeds,but should be careful throwing money around in unknown areas
YOUR KINDNESS IS OVERWHELMING 🙏GOD BLESS YOU MY FRIEND FROM GLASGOW SCOTLAND 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
One day I saw a little boy looking at cotton candy, his grandma told him that unfortunately they don't have the money to buy it(they were really poor) and they kept walking. I don’t know what took over me but I ran towards to cotton candy shop, bought some then ran back 5o the boy in the middle of a very busy streets and gave the boy the cotton candy. He looked at me as if he saw an angel and said thank you. I will never forget those  eyes, I continued walking and he ran after me with his grandma behind and he called me "Miss miss, thank you so much miss"  I told him it was nothing and went home tears in my eyes. While my action was very little, I understood how it could change a life. I, made it a point that I will help as much as I can. I was in the business field but I'm learning a course how to become a teacher. I want to help as much as I possibly can.
You are an angel to these people, let that sink in.
I love that you do this.. but don't do it for clout.. do it for love
I love you kid
You know we deal with watching so many people doing fake stuff or things for clout, but this man is actually out here changing people's lives. You are a genuine wonderful person with the things you do. I hope it encourages others
Where’s my 10k
You’re so dope man!!!
Does he only do this in Mexico?
Thank you
Love is the only way.
I swear you god bless. Everytime i watch your videos i get teary …. GOD BLESS YOU & YOYR FAMILY! Bottom of my heart
Dude you’re helping so much is literally makes everyone’s life better. Mines better just by watching. Teaches me to do something selfless and try to make others happy
You know he hit that after😉
I am absolutely LOVING these videos.
You are a treasure! You treat people exactly as I hope to raise my son to do. No matter the language, their position in life, their troubles, they all matter and deserve happiness and kindness.
Angel 😇

I'm worried that her "boss" is gonna swoop on those "profits." That's the problem with charity around the world, it gets intercepted by those in charge.
Man, that's where u need to be. thank u.

Its good to see that there is still good people in this world , I haven't seen that kind of kindness and generosity , in a long time back in 1980s but who ever you are you get you're house if gold in the heavens .  From ; sad girl 💗

U change ppls lives wen u do this it blows me away your blessed in life an u bless others 🙏 amazing
You know what's a shame! is that there are so many people out there who NEED a little help, just a little bit of help. which would make there lives so much better.. And there are rich people like Elon Musk etc etc who could easily, and I mean easily help LITERALLY millions of people who NEED that "little" bit of help. But they REFUSE to do! 🤬
My goal in life is to become stable enough off of my own success to do shit like this whenever i want.
Wtf would you tell your boss?
This guy makes me cry
That lady was not even the one working… man the boss didn’t even give the money to the lady.
Angels abound everywhere.peace and love to you sir , and blessings to your family and friends circle.
Everytime you help someone you become kinda of a GOD to them 😁🙏🏽❤️ Aka God's work.
I like these videos

🤲🏾
I loved how the lady LOL thinking it was a joke. It's good he helped her husband with medical bills.
The owner got the coin not the lady working
At the rate of all the vids he’s posted in Mexico you’d think he’d speak at least a little Spanish but I feel like he doesn’t that way the people have to translate in English for themselves letting us know what they’re saying and we’re not confused, thanks for doing that😅
Angel= Kind hearted people
God bless y'all..i hope her husband get's better soon ♡♡♡♡
This guy is a angel walking among us. People who are millionaires learn from this guy just little stuff like this can make a person year better.

De lalaki ni angel botan !
This guy doesn’t discriminate against anyone and he just gives back not wanting anything in return. Respect ✊ and I hope you get the blessing you deserve
Normally I don't like People filming these things. He, however, doesn't make it about himself being a good person. He really makes it about the people and their stories.
Didn't make me smile..made me cry..
U bless, those woman!!!! "THANK YOU"!!!! Especially this pandimic,THANK YOU!!!
Someone somehow please get this man more followers, this brings me warmth every time

The evil translator  DIDNT translate what he ask her she didn’t believe that he was offering instead of 2,000 pesos instead he will give 10,000 pesos and he wants only one piece so the translator said that’s the double and I don’t understand so she lied and translate that her husband is very sick and you are like an Angel. What a jerk the female translator envy evil she never told them that he only one want one piece and give them 10,000 pesos.
I need him to stop by my house I'm a disabled veteran missing a left leg AKA and a right foot right pinky toe I could use some help
Her husband is sick yet she is so cheerful, kind and hardworking. She deserves every bit of happiness.
Awesome id know if it cuz the look like family members lmao but this shit hits my heart
Video production cost 10,000 peso ($500). Video profit $4,723.  Who is really helping who??
These videos bring me so much I can’t put into words! Love love love
Amazing Wonderful 💓
You always make me smile 😊 Thank you 🙏🏾
Where is my $10,000 I didn't smile
Bro I dont wanna be rich and have cars mansions I wanna do this for helpless people

You good man may God Almighty Reward you for that Ameen
Billionaires prefer rockets and high tech coca cola stock shares than give people a healthy life
when she brought up her husband being sick and this man being sent by God as if he’s an angel nearly made me cry 🙏🏻

Respect
Your really a nice men you help people i salute you im from philippines bt wrking here in saudi
I swear working mothers just breaks my heart because all I think about is my own mum who has worked pretty much her entire life since she was a teenager. I desperately want to retire both of my parents ASAP In Sha Allah!
She said “Dos cinquenta” which means “2.50”
My favourite person in the world! What a bloke! ❤️❤️❤️
I understand it’s MUCH! God Bless❤️
❤️❤️
Dam bruh thank you for making these videos, they show me that there is still hope for humanity😎😎😎😎💯💯💯💯💯💯
Man, heaven is yours. Bless you.
All the videos that you make make my day
Love brother love 🙏🏾
My eyes are sweating profusely
Bro give the worker the money not the owner. Wtf. She's already making money
The female who called her boss is a honest worker she called her boss to even see "check" if she could take it most people would pocket the money as if it never happened
She could of took it n bought em all n kept the rest n be done work for the day but she calls her boss instead lol 😆 🤣
The only problem I see with what this guy is doing.. ..... Matthew 6:3-4  New International Version  3 But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
It's post to make u smile in need the 10000
His videos are not about him their about helping out people that are very hard working just to put food on the table for their families and what he does is amazing for people 👍
Why they switch the recipients/the peope.???
Best man 👍❤️😭
10,000 MINE
Show the whole world some love! Good dude

When I want to smile and appreciate humanity, I come to watch your videos, mate.🖤
Giving her all that money out in the open like that gone make her a target, to many ppl just standing there watching that
I aspire to be anle to afford to be as wholesome and positive and generous as you ate I cannot wait until I become successful to help others in need, and thank you SO MUCH for showing me that extremely generous people CAN be EXTREMELY successful,  since you have to be to be able to afford all you do and can STILL keep on doing it without fail
I never thought people like you existed. I've had so many moments in life where I wish I would encounter someone like you. Thank you and God bless you
