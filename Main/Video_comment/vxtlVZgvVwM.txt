Yeah
You can tell you're paranoid of no viewers or lack attention when you use clickbait methods..

Like and sub❤
The campfire under the moss carpet. Not a bad idea! But I already know that a long time ago. Apparently. Because I dig 2 blocks down, add a campfire, and add a block to cover it. But for the way you said it, it is very cool for Halloween builds 🎃😜

And the two other
how di u get invisible item frame?!
Idea: put a crate facing up and then a plant on top
Clickbait diagonal block
Wait a minute neither of the things in the thumbnail were in this video! Fakers!
Did you know you can make a working sink that fills and empties using a dispenser with a water bucket inside then stairs on top and a button on the side? Put a tripwire hook over it to look like the tap.
I wouldn't make that "guarantee" if I were you, the first one I've been using since they introduced corner stairs. The wall texturing is a common trick, and using the wall block to give walls more depth, though you can't place some blocks directly next to them or it ruins it. The campfire smoke is one I use a lot, did you know you can make the smoke higher by placing the campfire on top of a hay bale block? Been using waterlogged slabs for my farms since you can put them on the top half of the block and it just looks like a path, makes the water completely hidden. Been using the couch cushion trick since banners were introduced too. Table was the first thing I used scaffolding for tbh.
I bet you this comment won’t get a single like 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😰😰😰😰😰😰🥺🥺🥺😢😢😭😢😢😢😭😢
Here's my question.. how in the world do you put pressure plates over frames or banners over frames.. riddle me that one
5:52  *Harry Potter music plays*
Did you know in Minecraft? If you take buttons you can actually make Lego.

6:47 Hey, that's me! :D
Hey, I was sent this video by a friend of mine as I'm the person second from the left in the orange scarf shown at 6:56 with the Realms cape. Just figured I'd let you know that some Realms mapmakers (including myself and about half the people shown in that clip) got the cape more from coding and designing games than building. Also, it doesn't necessarily have to be 3 maps on Realms, it varies depending on what kind of map you submit. Congrats on the video trending though!
At first I was gonna start cursing at you because I thought you weren't gonna put anything funny in the video, making it lame, but you made my day by putting that zombie clip at the end.

🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Cool video, but you earned a dislike with your clickbait thumbnail.
3:02 when the chair is sus
