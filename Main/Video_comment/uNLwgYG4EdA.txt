POV: you're making a video and you say one of the chains that your gonna talk about in another video. The video being about some lore in ads
The intro is just Mr beast
Matty boy predicted dogpack404.
I knew it was a ghost kitchen the first time I saw it on door dash and it came out of my buddy's restaurant.
this didnt age well
What is with Mat and Buca Di Beppo?
Do these places still exist?
Mr Beast burger was a fad like fidget spinners

Food Theory: MrBeast Is NOT What You Think...
In light of recent events, I have just one thing to say: The Prophecy is true and a very unfortunate truth it is.
Why did I never hear about this???
Well this is certainly interesting to watch after hearing the new allegations of Mr. Beast faking his content. For someone who supposedly gives way money like its candy, if you actually look closely at the clips, you'll notice that Mr. Beast is actually giving away one-dollar bills, which are literal chump change. I'm surprised no one noticed this before now.
wow no offensive buy you defneding mr beast did not agewell
fraud
Mr. Beast is the antichrist
I don't know if this is fact or not cuz at the end, " BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST A GOOD THEORY!"
Bro I was watching this then a tornado hit my area 😭😭
How can I add Mitch Tar Biz to your head
the cat is haunted❤ 6:20 6:21
I miss matpat
Eating from a ghost kitchen dosen’t feel safe to me.
Always matpat with Buca di Beppo 🙃
MOST ARE CLOSED NOW...LOL
My college does this for like four different virtual restaurants
Thanks I’m going to go be a billionaire 💸😼
Although I think it's a bit pompous to give money away on video, I still have to respect Mr. Beast for the sheer amount of money he gives away. Dude is kind.
This didn’t age well
So Mr. Beast isn't as bright as we think...
This aged well
Complete BS. Any honest Chef who cares about their product and brand would never relinquish control of the final product to a third party kitchen. Let alone a delivery service who ruins the final product with feeble attempts to keep it warm. It is simply impossible to deliver a meal that is 50% as good as served in store. The sad part of this is that the review bar has been dramatically lowered by lazy diners who will not go to brick and mortar sights who’s meager profits are eroded by these scavenger delivery company’s
I want a hand-out😐
Previous Bertuccis manager…a dying chain of Robert Earl…we experienced this first hand….the idea was inventive BUT working the restaurants all in one…was a NIGHTMARE! at one point we had 11 of them (including all these mentioned) cooking ALL the kitchens on top of our own restaurant with little to no staff due to strict Labor cost….this video was my life for 3yrs 😅
the video title aged well.
Could you do one about his Feastables too?
Yea
As someone who makes products for two VDBs in my corporate restaurant, I am obliged to say: Not everyone wins in this scenario. The employees have to do more work, but they don't get compensated for it.  This needs to change, period.
In-in out
You know, if Fnaf had a sister brand they’d probably have to have it in a “Sister Location”.  Get it? It’s funny right? No… Ok I’ll stop now.
Watching this episode 2 years later, for the first time, after watching the new one from 3 weeks ago...
Well that didn't age well. As of 2023 Mr Beast is filing a lawsuit against VDC themselves due to the poor quality of MrBeast Burgers, The problem with Ghost Kitchens is that you can't control a lot of the food quality. Whenever you order a MrBeast burger you're actually ordering it from another restaurant. The Mrbeast burger brand is basically a ghost with no body(a fast food brand with no physical locations) It seems like Mrbeast is now wanting to cut ties with VDC themselves because of the food quality, The whole purpose of partnering up with VDC is to help struggling restaurants to earn some money, But now things have changed. The idea of Mrbeast having his own fast food brand was a splendid idea  but the execution wasn't great at all. As with this ambitious ideas and projects overtime they fail to deliver. Personally i didn't want it to fail, I have always been dying to eat his burgers..But now..I guess it won't happened
Aged like Milk!
And as with any promising new idea, capitalism went and milked it until the dam busted, and now ghost kitchens are known for unsafe working conditions, abused and injured employees, and tanking food quality and safety.
This didnt age well
Bad idea mate
REPENT FOR THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK SOON
Like cheese they say
This aged well
odd seeing this after the lawsuits that were news recently. Chucky Cheese here has at least two virtual restaurants. Logan's Steakhouse has an Italian kitchen. Mr Beast is ran out of Red Robin--at least in Norman Oklahoma.
Well now this video is a doozy, innit?
Ironic
Now that is DARK
@notspon
Irony
Guess it wasn't what we thought
Looks at beast burger on door dash actually gets Red Robin instead of the beast burger
That one didn't age quite so well...
Well this video aged like fine milk with @mrbeast suing virtual dinning to stop serving his burger due to awful quality of food that damage his brand
Who’s here after he shut down MrBeast Burger 😢😢
Interesting Mr Best Burgers comes from Red Robin in my area.
this video has aged horribly
Zero quality control.   It's a terrible concept.
Turns out quality control might be what kills this model.
555 Theorist Way Meme Town, CA 555555
Mr. Beast Burger has an actual location at the new American Dream Mall in NJ.
Robert Earl also owns Earl  Of Sandwich in Disney World doesn’t he?
delivery would definitely be the default for me if I was rich, my family's wallet can't take the delivery fee so many times, sometimes the food costs twice as much as opposed to walking there or taking out on the way home :)
So I worked at chilis and we had one called it’s just wings, and I remember a customer that came in to order it’s just wings, I tried to explain to him that it can only be ordered through DoorDash, however his wife was on the phone and I heard her say “put me on speaker so I can talk to that b**ch” he decided to and I got called things that I’ve never been called and never could have imagined being called. I told her to eat a snickers.
I just looked into it the mr beast restaurant closest to me is run out of a Red Robin crazy
Hey Siri
Bro I think that is so cool! I looked it up and where I live MrBeast burger 🍔 is at ruby Tuesday
I can't wait until people have finally forgotten about Mr. Beast and I don't have to hear about that guy ever again~
STOP SAUING BUCA DI BEPPO
And now it’s closed 😮
I want MrBeast burger, but it’s too far away
us eating mcdonalds Matpat eatin buka bebepto
There is a Mrbeast burger 🍔 at a big boy and the big boy closed recently so sadly a MrBeast burger has now closed 😢
6:45 it was at that moment I realised "Buca di Beppo" is not some stereotypical italian restaurant name MatPat made up.
lie
the fact that ive never had delivery and only gotten food by cooking or just going to an actual restaurant
Am I the only one that Would order from a Matt Patt restaurant or Ghost kitchen? 🤔😂🤣
i'm not a fan of mister beast.  giving out packs of cash or luxury items screams "you poor sobs , i'll give you money because i'm rich, now worship me" vibes.  and i hate that kind of behaviour, it screams elitism.  the only things he did that i liked was planting trees and making sure people who needed eye surgery could have them.  other that that, it's all pandering and pretending to be great while ( most likely ) looking down on people.
It hurts me to see mrbeast giving out free money!
It’s so sad that mrbeast made this a virtual restaurant instead of a actual restaurant
Burger King has (number_placeholder_insert_eminem_2009_meme_image) places and Hungry Jacks has a lot of areas (Hungry Jacks is Burger King in Australia)
Why hasn't MATPAT started a Virtual Food Theory Kitchen?! After all; HE NO LONGER OWNS ANY OF THE THEORIST CHANNELS; Lunar X does!
OK
Intro:may pat flexing as he is now rich
Learn to love Jesus he loves us all
This is not a sustainable business. Something about it don’t don’t feel right. 😂
dang I could use that handful of money.
that's pretty smart
so you just buying mr beast name not actual good burgers,...
You have ignored the health code issues with ghost kitchens
LankyBox kitchen.
I worked for a place that had a Mr. Beast burger. food was great and I think it’s a good idea
4 big guys
My only problem with this is the quality of the food will always be different? Where I’m from it’s at on the border, just seems kind of strange to me
The intro. ☠️
Did anyone know the chicken nuggets from McDonald's or Ashley from real chickens I'm not joking
It’s cool but it’s also just another example of, “You will own nothing, and you will like it.”
Beast team if you come back and look at this pay off my credit card
K   Jjjkjjjj
Delivering the foooooooooodddd
Don't forget about the place called lankybox kitchen heard it sucks
i can test to that my favorite china baffia closed due to covid sadly 8:38
i had one of his burgers they really werent that good nor did they look it and the menu is extremely confusing and im still waiting for the poison to kick in
It’s exists now
Wow
He made a pun in the intro cuz he said waste of money and MrBeast kinda wasted his own money 😂 but LOVE you MatPat
I wish I could buy idk if there is vegetarian options
8:30 not true. Also yeah, of course you’re a f*cking capitalist. I didn’t expect anything more from you 🙄
It’s easy he’s which is MrBeast right now he’s been there in so half of his business everything right now I think it’s storming there but I don’t know when you doing you can spin meaning of dollars instill yes money squid games biggest YouTube video in consume meaning of the dollars cost the same price that we make squid game itself
Fact mr beast burger is in one whole country just usa
you guys should revisit this concept now that we know how many issues there are with virtual kitchens
No offence bro, but are you just trying to get revenge because you lost 1mil In a hide of seek?
Yep, any Uber Eats or Doordash driver could tell you.
This video is 11 minutes and 11 seconds!!!
I was in Texas a while back and went to one it was just a sketchy trailer we almost left but then some one came out with food and it was actually really good and the people were really nice ps it sounds dum but I asked if they had ever actually MET Mr Beast                                                             They said no
Only a matter of time before we get theory burger
It sounds like Ghost kitchens can get really complicated legally.
Chilis does this with its just wings
Wait theory in progress but could the money in some of them be from other people’s perches
you look like
Mr beeeeeeeeeeast
A restraint I go to on fridays has MrBeast burger food and other stuff in there kitchen
By the way it really depends what restaurant makes your burgers, also most ytbers just hype it up.. Its good food tho!
Umm who’s gonna tell him that’s not a napkin
There's a ghost kitchen in walking distance of my house
The day Beast Burger arrives in Italy, I will immediately order.
You should do an update of this because he now has a store
To be honest I only clicked this video because the run time was 11:11
MrBeast you should have like an actual restaurant like people can eat inside
Anybody remember flavor flave, who started a chicken restaurant in Iowa, but then it failed so badly
We surprisingly have a Mr. Beast's Burget joint here in my tiny dump of of town, Florence SC. And it's comes from a Ruby Tuesday. lol. And as a Door Dash driver, the introduction of Ghost Kitchens confused me at first. I'd get orders for "Pasquali's Pizza" and it'd take me to Chucky Cheese. I was lost. lol I actually called the restaurant and they explained to me what a ghost kitchen was. I felt so dumb.
MatPat got his fnaf delivery wish! :D
5:59, I haven’t gone to a Bravo in YEARS..we went like once or twice and years later we wanted to go again. Only to find out the one closest to us (like 45+ min) had shut down..now there are none near us ;-;
my aunt works at red robin and has made beast burgers. theyre definetly worth a try, 7/10
i'm going to eat there with my vr headset!
No buy lanky box kitchen
Mine was a Red Robin 😭😭😭
New video IDEA: you could make a theory about if ‘My Hero Academia’ is possible. Thank you for reading this if you see it!
Hi MatPat.
And here i thought you was gonna say it does bad things but thank goodness it is a good thing
You just hate jimmy
Lol
His food is fine
God bless❤
I'm gonna be honest I thought "Buca di Beppo" was a made up thing and then I googled it and was surprised lmao
Hi Mr Beast I am learning about Ghost Kitchen and it is a new trend I did not hear about it in Europe.  But it is hard to open Mr Beast Burger in Europe because of the languid beerier that people in Europe speak so many languages. I would have an Idea how to do the Ghost Kitchen in Poland and in Germany but with your videos and with a Twist because translating your Videos just to a different language is not en-ought. I am 44 years old and I have 14 years experience in low and management in Poland and I had for 14 years a Company in Poland that I closed last month. I will be happy to start cooperation with you not only by doing Mr Beast Burgers in Europe but as well cooperation with making videos. I have an Idea how to do it together with you but little different with a twist. I speak English and German so you we can start cooperation anytime if you like? Best Regards David
Shop now!!!!!!
Food theory you ruin mrbeast
Shut up!
Was this vid made because you lost the hide and seek thingy thingy
Love your montage
I'm only about 3 mins into the video, but there have been "restaurants" (even before celebs jumped on the wagon) selling their food exclusively through delivery apps by having other established kitchens make their food for many years before MrBeast Burger came out, just at a smaller scale. The idea was just adapted, not at all original.
No it’s a win win win win. One for mrbeast. One for the restaurant. One for the delivery company and one for the customer
Man, that's like buying stocks, except it's restaurants!
The strange part is that Jimmy chose failing restaurants to make his food. Like, if they’re failing restaurants, there is a high chance that there is a REASON that it is failing.
4:43 pov you have 2 glasses on              just a joke
I am watching this video December 2022 and the first ever physical mrbeast burger restaurant dropped looks there are no more differences between matdonalds mrbeast burger.
seems super shady.
this model relies on brand recognition alone with zero quality control. It's not sustainable.
This video aged like a gallon of milk left sitting in the Sahara Desert, lid-off, at 1:00pm in the afternoon in the middle of a heat wave sometime in Late July.
Matpat: it’s a ghost restaurant Mrbeast: well we’ll well look at this a restaurant in a mall yeah so you are wrong
My mom and I have ordered a lot of delivery lately, and are now, for the first time, seeing the Mr Beast burger available in our city. I wanted wraps, but mom had her heart set on burgers, so I guess that's our dinner now.
This guy can tell everyone that everything is a dream and we are in the stone ages and when we wake up we will actully make it to the modern ages
The fact fnaf is now opening a viral restaurant 😧
This is A fake theory Cause all of your theories almost have been a lie
My sister loves Mr. B’s
Pretty clever I gotta say. #jakehunter88
I don’t get it. Who make the food in all those cities
I just ordered Mr. Beast Burger… looked on maps where it was compared to where it was on doordash. The map location is a Perkins!!
Ur just trying to expose him when it is real when i order a burger i will say if its real or not
Now, there is a Beast Burger in the American Dream Mall here in East Rutherford! (An physical Restuarant)
wait a minute...how does he know what paper tastes like??
Jimmy is a genius
Well now its real
Plane Jane cheeseburger mayonnaise on both sides of the bun onion on top relish on bottom bun love the Mr beast burgers
I still have yet to have a Mr. Beast Burger. May try one this week. Will probably update when I try it
haters
mr best is good
Well Mr beast just unveiled an opening for the actual restaurant
Here in 2022, we have an eat in beast burger. Eat that mat pat!!

Thanks for answering all my Ghost Restaurant questions even those I didn't know I had!
We need an IRL FNaF restaurant! it just has to happen!
NOT ANYMORE
Ghost kitchen
It was the worst burger I've ever had. The order was completely wrong and it was insanely salty
It's real you dummy
I was reverse ghost kitchened last year, ordered from a chain burger restaurant and then received food that was definitely not from that restaurant. Technically it was the food I ordered but the packaging and specifics (curly fries vs regular fries) did not match what I was expecting to receive from the chain place. A different restaurant was advertised on the packaging and the bag and other packaging was very generic like something you would expect from a small business restaurant. I wonder if they were running a ghost kitchen out of that restaurant and accidentally fulfilled my order thinking it was for the ghost kitchen.
Watching this on September 10th feels wrong
My Mr Beast burger is out of a Hardee’s
I LOVE YOU FOR THEESE VIDIOS NEVER CHANGE
it's been over a year as of me writing this, Jimmy has finally Now built the world's first physical (or the "brick-n-mortar, whatever that means) location in the second largest mall in America. and oh boy, was its packed!
Work at a Perkins, can confirm that we make Mr. Beast Burgers and Papa Corazons food.
3:02 Viewer from the future here  Yeah, digital/ghost brands are absolutely a common thing nowadays. One of my favorites nearby is Cosmic Wings, which based on delivery tracking seems to be run out of a local applebees.
@mrbeast I'd like to try your restaurant but I have celiac disease. So if you could use dedicated fryers and offer gluten free buns, I'd definitely appreciate it.
nah
I love food theorist, but did you really have to go for da beast burgers
Great video!  Check out my experience at the first Beast burger store at American Dream mall after waiting 17 hours.  let me know what u think  https://youtu.be/S23Ns8lfAhI
It is now real
Bruh its 2h and 30m from Swindon
Looks like they opened there own restaurant
Yes it sucked we tried them all
Please make a video choosing the best delivery app 1.Uber eats 2.door dash 3.postmate 4.grub hub
Shut up
I like the way Mat says "Buca di Beppo" so much
Milad has basically confirmed that this theory is a fact...
I kind of hate Mr. B's cuz he took away my my primary motivation for money. I was going to do what he did when I was rich and successful but he beat me to it on the same platform that I use. I want to strangle that guy sometimes. What's it like having a disposable income that you can use to help others?
This would be a great idea for Arby’s
Isn't that already somebody's slogan?
My closest MrBeast Burger is at a Red Robin apparently 😂🤷‍♂
I Declare MrBeast Burger A Health Hazard To All Of My Citizens!
I hate you is real
“Tastes like paper” wait how do you know what paper tastes like?
Mr beast burger operates at bucca di beppo.
Mr beast is wack af
So it's a scam?
Is Carmel better chocolate
mr beast should international his fast food to europe or asia
this is annoying though if u hate a restaurant and then get the same burger from them your trying to avoid
Mr. Beast burger does not work as well post pandemic, the kitchen I work at often gets way overwhelmed with in house orders, to go orders, and me beast orders, and drivers end up having to wait upwards of 30 minutes for their beast order
I looked up a MrBeast Burger location on my navigation last night.  Found a location 20 minutes from where I was and saw delivery or pickup.  So I thought this was a actual eating location or at least a walk up window (yea I should have done more research but my son is a big fan and was soo excited to eat there).  Drove there and it was a run down Red Robbin restaurant.  No lighting in the parking lot, very little cars and a homeless encampment on the far side of the parking lot (I was in the Sacramento area).  The restaurant was dimly lit, I could barely make out figures moving around out front and inside but not many.  It looked closed.  I drove around the restaurant and the homeless were dumping their garbage in the dumpster.  The place was dead.  Nothing of quality was coming out of there!  I drove away disappointed and my son cried and was very upset, still is the next day.  Ghost kitchens is maybe a great cost saving business move but no way to know how the quality is going to be.  I won't be ordering from ghost kitchens anytime soon.  Walking into a restaurant looking around and looking at the food is one way to judge if you want to eat there.  Some places I go in, look around and then walk right out.
My uncle works at DoorDash and gives me McDonald’s all the time
Love the way he says buca de beppo
I love dat burger
100 millions rtards know and like this dweeb…
Hi
Tldr, ghost kitchens
Whjat was that at the first secong
i am a sever at perkins and we make the beast burgers in our kitchen. i have packed beast bags myself!
there are a few places through doordash like this. friendlys and chilis kitchens are used in my town for them.
I'm in kansas.  Just ordered a chicken sandwich with fries and cookies and they are amazing! Whoever cooked my food is awesome!
Mat asked Scott answered
I remember going to Buca Di Beppo a long time ago and my whole family loved it
wow amazing i had no idead that was possible nice
There are now going to be fnaf ghost kitchens, you predicted the future
You sold do videos on how to set up these things
Rochester NY’s mr beast is literally just Red Robin’s, legit got it in a Red Robin bag too
The food was much better than expected
That fnaf irl comment aged well
all of the locations near me closed permanently lol
United States moment
Mr beast is not dead with no food don't get sad
Dam bruh I'm a better Theriot because! Mrbeast burger is Perkins not 🧢
Rip mr beast
Just ordered some. Product is pretty bad. The beef is okay, but the rest of the burger is just too much sauce, sloppy and soggy.  This is just a cash grab, but if you don't believe me, try it yourself.  I recommend the Chandler burger because it's less stuff on a burger to disappoint you.
I hate ghost kitchens. 99% of them seem intentionally misleading, if I scroll past a Denny's, it's because I'm not interested in the food being served at a Denny's. Then I see a "Burger Den" with nice pictures, decent pricing thinking it's a local place I haven't tried before. So I place my order only for it to be a mediocre burger. If I wanted a Denny's burger I would have ordered a Denny's burger.
everything is moving towards a rental system
It’s all fun and games until Fnaf actually happens
fnaf will be real in 52 minutes.                that was 52 minutes ago.
10:40 When you come from today's game theory and it's really happening
yk fnaf irl is happening
There’s actually a “Freddy’s pizzaria” in Lebanon. Coincidence???      yeah probably
I really want to order Mr. beast Burger but I’m a slight too far away from it
Noice
i really want food
I knew that before clicking the video and I knew what you we’re going to talk about. I picked up my food from some restaurants I never heard of
Rill fnaf and fod fery a smrte way to cok yyeyeyeyyeyeyeyeyeyey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🔪🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪 i want to see a rill life 🎪👶🏻
Whenever you show the map I look at where I live and I think this will give it away, it has a hook at the end and it is on the edge duh
Lol this is genius
He threw so much money in the trash he can’t afford to get good food!
THE BOIIIIIIIISSSSSSSSSS
Stop	being	so mean		to	mrbeast
Me is italia 🇮🇹
It's genius. Not meant to be quality. This is straight up leverage. I'd do the same thing if I was him. Opening a store front is so time consuming
im only in it for the money
Why do you have to call it ghost kitchens though..
What’s crazy now is in my town I have seen a building pop up that is solely a kitchen for ghost kitchens. There is no branding on the building except for some signs saying for Doordash, grub hub, etc to pickup inside
I went to Buca di Beppo once and they had a Mr. Beast Burger advertisement on their door
everyone pulled up for money,not food lol
Guys and ghouls? Seriously matpat?
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
I get he's rich but how are you gonna pay rent.
I don’t really agree
Well atleast mrbeast helped with the unenployement thing.
I was a really sheltered growing up and in middle school I was picked on a lot for it. Other kids would trick me into embarrassing myself. They told me that DTF ment Down To Fish. I liked going fishing and they told me to say I'm DTF to my dad to ask him to take me fishing. I got yelled at because I didnt know.
*eats food while watching* *yes, eating food while watching (2 years later)*
the reason why mr beast burger is bad is prolly bcs they are made by random people in the kitchen
They came to my town and LET ME TELL YOU…      It wasn’t that good.
I just checked my DoorDash app mrbeast burger near me is from a Red Robin’s cool
Who cares? hes awsome
And I Like In-N-Out
If I got my MrBeast Burger then HOW IS IT FAKE HUH ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
i want a mrbeast burger but its not in the uk 😔😭
robbert earl is my dad im earl harmon
I can’t believe this was actually right and we are getting FNAF pizza like this
That part where he talks about the possibility of a fnaf virtual restaurant aged better than the Queen herself
The most surprising thing about this to me is that "Bucca de Beppo" is not just a phrase people say to sound vaguely Italian but an actual restaurant
Impressed 100
10:36 he totally called it
Robert earls Reasturants all start With B
There's only one thing to do now, make Tai Theory
Freddy fazbears pizza is coming
Freddy's is doing a virual dining concept. You heard me. Freddy Fazbear's.
i don’t like the start of the video
To go specialist here! Totally correct! I work for restaurant that also carries virtual brands including mrbeast burgers! Annoying to work with lol but a really cool concept!
I was waiting for Red Robin to be mentioned. I worked in a Red Robin and we had MrBeast Burgers going out. They were decent, but we did make them from mostly the same ingredients we already had. Patties were just a half regular patty smashed in half. I think the main thing we didn't have were the crinkle-cut fries, because we normally used steak fries.  I don't work there anymore cause gas got too expensive for the half hour drive both ways, but the food was great and the people were too. My favorite burgers were the BBQ burger and a Teriyaki Fried Chicken. I had one somewhat micromanager, but he mostly made up for it with lots of back-and-forth banter. Once had the nerve to peek his face over my shoulder while I was in the dish pit, demanding I scrub the flour bowl instead of letting it soak to get the caked on flour off. I slung some of the dirty water at him (it wasn't super dirty, just had a little flour in it), he sprayed me back with the sprayer. We were even and he didn't bother me about scrubbing the flour bowls again. Good times.
There is no mrbeast burger in Singapore sad
Who else skipped the whole video to hear interesting parts?
Seems like a gimmick, people are buying because it has Mr.Beasts name on it. Not for good food. They'll try it once, maybe twice but that'd be it.  I don't think the concept on Ghost Kitchens will last long. There is no way for a brand to ensure quality control if they're outsourcing everything to another restaurant. Ontop of that, the additional cost to outsource the food, and then the doordash fee, and tip, make the food too costly. Which causes them to switch to lower quality and cheaper products to maintain competitive prices. And as we see in reviews, results in a subpar, mediocre burger/food.
This episode predicted the fnaf virtual restaurant
Fun fact: the joke about a fnaf ghost kitchen might actually happen. It is currently in the planning stages and it’s being made by the same company that made Beast Burger.
bro thats real
Watch Polymatter 's video about Mr beast Burger.
just a little side note where i live only Mr. beasts burger is available, interesting. Much love matt love your vids <3 Keep up the amazing work  Side side note, deff gonna get some Mr. beast burger now XD
I tried to order mr beast burger but they got my order wrong seven times so we just hung up
This is so fake cuz the I have one that's open for indoor and it was not a restaurant at all now it's a Mr B's Burger and it's the real cuz I know people that been in it I know I've been in it personally and it is a real Mr B's Burger
My friend and I didn’t know this, so we tried to drive to the Mr. Beast Burger in our town and we were SO confused when it took us to a Red Robin instead. Then when we ordered it we were confused when the ingredients seemed to be from Red Robin as well. (i.e. the French fries being Red Robin fries and the burgers looking different than the pictures online) but this makes so much more sense!
i think its dumb why would i pay more for someone else to cook my food. ill just pay them and get the same stuff Second im a doordasher and for every virtual order i get. i get 10 for the store its self.  so i dont see how this is anything more then a fad that will die soon
1:17 lol that dude jizzed his pants when he saw that money.
You are lieing
This feels weird. Like, there's no inherent risk in opening a new restaurant. Just profit for the ghost kitchen, and their sponsors. For someone who claims to want to die with no money in his bank account, this seems pretty counterintuitive to that principle. You as a customer, still have to pay for the food. This isn't some philanthropic venture, not that it has to be, but it's certainly a far cry from the publicity stunt Mr. Beast decided to pull the first time.
Just had it. I like it. You know your business. :D
LIES ALL LIES
mrbeast have the best food
It’s exactly what I thought it was
There's one in watertown sd, (out of the Perkins) and I've delivered so many orders for it on doordash
The one guy that managed to ruin flipping food
…. What
I cooked for a ghost kitchen and didn't even know it. the shitty managers didn't even know how to explain what was going on. my main problem is people trying to order food online 3 minutes before close.
The food is terrible though.
I had the MR Beast burger, it was BK quality with Five Guys prices...so im now thinking that Mr. Beast outsourced to my local BK....

You probably could launch 300 restaurants in less than 6 from scratch. It would probably require starting a thousand that take a year but have them will be done much faster just based on the amount of time you have to wait before you can start in random locations.
This video sucks this video is not true!!
I feel like quality would be a issue
LOL matpateroni your so funy the burger taste like papern\ cose it has money it it haha your so silly
Yes i'm watching food theory, yes i'm enjoying it
This hypothesis is partly true. This is idea really started with ma and pa restaurants cooking out of their house. These restaurants existed only as an icon in a delivery app.
Worst
Matpat: taste like paper. Bacteria: hello peter
Bro it's real 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Everytime he says Buca di Beppo it sounds more and more like a fake name
Mrbeast burger IS REAL
I went to a place called MR BEAST BURGER in San Antonio Tx and it was nothing as expected. What happened folks y’all just say go here and it’s like a food Ponzi scheme.  Food was nothing good. Had to order online only. And 20 min later I was like the flavor was frozen Pattie’s.
I was wondering why there wasn’t a actual building my beast burger is in a Red Robin
This is not a new idea kids. 'ghost kitchens' have been around since restaurants have been operating. Mr Beast has just put the concept on BLAST amid a new gen of hucksters - keep rockin tho!
your just a hater
No it’s real
What about Domino's campaign for taking down independent food delivery apps? So far, you never talk about those commercials. Domino's is a pizza joint by the way. For a company that delivers pizza, why do they think DoorDash and other similar apps are going to put restaurants out of buisness? Please do a theory on this, I want to know what your thoughts are.
mrbeast please put your restorants in ottawa in canada too
make more game theories
What if fnaf sister location is fnaf sister brand?
Ive never seen more a prosest food then his
It’s technically actually real if they’re making food and customers are liking it.
Just looked up MrBeast Burger in my area. It’s run out of a Red Robin restaurant. 🤣
C c. C
Yes
The resturant is real
She is not fake you are fake
Watching this while I wait on Uber eats to bring my MrBeast burger
Genius actually.   If the restaurant has staff needing to work & quality / standards can be kept the same across the country, Jimmy's a smart guy.  Well done. Just ordered here in AZ thru DD.  Can't wait to try these fries, Mr Beast burger & Nashville spicy chicken.
Trash
MrBeast "Today, I bought every Buca Di Bebbos in the United States!"
A burger King ad popped out before I watched this video
A year later,  the issue with this model is the quality. I was in love with Beast burger for months until a new kitchen started delivering and the quality plummitted.
Yeah I didn’t like the burger I had it wasn’t good at all it was bland.
I live in philipines i just dony know if its here in ph tho :(
I've been clickbait
Grubhub and doordash and mrbeast burger are the best delivery
When the burger costs -10,000$
ok welp im gonna just watch food theory and gonna get rich off their ideas
Matpat: Fnaf sister brand does have a nice ring to it. Fnaf Sister location: Am i a joke to you?
I like how in the beginning he said a waste of money even though it's free I think
please do a video ab how he pays taxes/probably gets around some of them and how much money he actually makes while giving away millions every week
Delicious burger and fries
how does the burger taste ? like the ones restaurant make or does his burgers have their own original recipe
Order now!
Only problem is that they will not able to maintain the taste of food
Lol, I thought this was actually an expose video until I saw who uploaded it
His menu isn't that good and the quality varies depending on where you live because it depends on what company is making the food in your area.
We seen mR beast ordering stickers in an operating Red Robin, Any Ideas matpat?
Another amazing video!
e
Its one in Memphis i gotta say it was good asf the bun was sweet an the meat season so well which i can walk in to order
ehhhmm seems like no food is save for The Food Theorists
I eat beast Burger
I actually did eat the mr beast burger today and i needed to look up some muckbangs and youtube videos on this
do you not have "just eat" in America?  or just not allowed to mention them xD
I can confirm I ordered mr best burger, and it was made by hwy55
LOLL
hey wtf, it wont taste worse because of ghost kitchens.
It's Mr beast I hate the food theorists
Ah, yes. Mr. Beast burgers, made from ethically sourced Mr. Beast meat.  Maybe I shouldn’t be saying that one out loud.
How did this come out OVER A YEAR AGO!?!?
Buy Beast chocolates
"Buca di Beppo" is the most Italian sounding phrase I've ever heard.
(:
Awsome
whenever i watch your videos i get hungrey
So I'm guessing the burger tastes radically different from city to city and state to state then?
ITS REAL
I work for bravo the ghost kitchens r horrible. And put so much stress on the staff that a majority of staff and managers walked out due to the horrible pay and added stress throwing multiple business on one group of staff. Worst thing to ever happen
If u say Beast burger 🍔 is bad I disagree a lot
MatPat 1st: WHY DON'T YOU ALREADY HAVE A GHOST KITCHEN PREPARING YOUR OWN FOOD (theories)? This is new, this is exciting, this isn't even a thing at my country just yet, don't miss out, Mat, don't miss out.  And second thing, this was over  A YEAR AGO????? And you seriously haven't launched your own "I can do everything better because I'm a theorist" franchise of food based on ghost kitchens???? Why, you already cook something from the ground up every two or three episodes, what's the harm on having a few GKs to deliver them to the people while they are flipping watching your videos??  You could make even backlinks off of those deliveries and have EVEN MORE VIEWS C'mon, you're seriously missing out. OR... Have you just partnered up with Mr.Beast? I have a feeling you're not missing out a single thing here hehe
Noob
Fun fact: Jimmy is my uncle's name lol
i'magine a furture where every resttraunt is online...
Buca de Bepo is just too fun to say...
Bister Meast
nothing is safe from matpat and his theories
Thank you I I don't know I didn't even check out the video but thank goodness because like he's he had like he's getting more money like you see like Mr Beast even though you're here like I want to ask you like do you think it's allowed to spend more money like day after day because my mom told me like I'm sick so yeah my mom told me you can spend too much money like all of your money if you have $500 a day so yeah Mr B's I might stick with food fairy or film for real game for early
It is real
It doesnt exist ....
It’s a masterpiece
I thought MatPat just made up the most random Italian named restaurant, “Buca Di Beppo”. I’ve never heard of this restaurants existence
Omg- i was wondering why when i looked on the map it said mr beast burger and Bertucci’s were the same restaurant
I've been to that Italian restaurant and have gotten beast burger and the cookies one to
Mat pat,” This video is 100% notspon” MrBeast,” Order now!”
This is literally what I was expecting they had done anyways lol
Honestly ghost kitchen aren't a bad concept in terms of benifit. The only thing I can think about that may be an issue is inconsistently managed establishments
Imagine being someone who went to those ghost kitchen restaurants daily, then your just going to one of them to get their food your used to, but when you pull up on the adress, all you see is a restaurant with they exact same foundation but with "MrBeast Burger" written all over...and you don't even know who MrBeast is...
We all know Mr gerbal only got where he is with his parents pocket book
The many locations called ghost kitchens will charge you more money then regular restaurants.
burger is real
I love the idea of irl restaurant locations more or less just being the kitchens for dozens of brands and such
just wanted to add one thing: *BUCCA DI BEPPO* !!!11
did mrbeast srsly *break* the comment section? lol this guy i swear ^^
money is NOT paper!
My MR BEAST BURGER is a Red Robin.
Plz Make Matpat Cola
I liked Mr. Beast Burger the first time I had it, but each sequential time afterwards it went downhill and even more downhill. It's not consistent sadly.
wow. i just had buca di beppo for lunch
A Mr. beast has a chocolate factory now
Example my dad deos door dash and you can get neast burger from ruby toesday but there is no part in the ruby tosday dedicated to mr beast
Mrbeast burger is cool er thean mcdonilds
I like mr beast burger i like mr beast mat pat why
Mr. Beast for President
I had beast burger from bravo and I’m not kidding almost completely vomited (it was raw)
his bregers are free
Finally a video that explains where it actually comes. I watched 2 videos and they didn't just straight up tell you, they over explained it and I got lost. This video is simple and strait to the point
I was just at that exact bravo location 😃
Im still gonna eat it.
Mr Beast himself exists without actually existing.  If anyone 'partners' with someone who literally says he is only famous because he knows how the YT algorithm works...   You're gonna have a bad time
so... Drop Shipping..
I FOUND THE SECRET EASTER EGG IN THE INTRO The dude squashing jelly is wearing a game theory shirt.
Oooooooooo
that intro is so triggering xd
I have so much to say, so here I go: 1) I love Love LOVE the idea of saving small businesses by getting them involved with celebrities' virtual food chains. It allows said small businesses to THRIVE, it allows delivery companies to thrive, and it allows celebrities to thrive! 2) Is there any way I can get involved? 3) MATPAT! I JUST SAW THE NEAR ENDING AND HAD A *GREAT IDEA*  Maybe YOU could make Freedy's real via virtual restaurants. You're already pretty well known, this idea exists, you just need to find existing restaurants.
please don’t do videos like this because i absolutely love Mrbeast and Mrbeast burger and he needs money because he spends a lot of money and Mrbeast burger is one of the ways that he gets money and you are just making him lose money (  i don’t mean to be rude about it )
I like this channel but most videos wheren't theories at all.
It is true, here in my town even one star and two star Michelin restaurants offer delivery set menu and it was so successful that they keep the service  even  open extra kitchen/ sister restaurant/location in more car/scooter accessible location for delivery service
ive heard cloud kitchen before ghost no XD
I'll unsubscribe to your channel if you hate Mr Beast
Sister location or sister brand?
Beast burger exist there’s one in south elgin where I love
I live right nextdoor to Fowster's Fweeze that sells MrBeast Burgers. But I can't order because I can't pick it up through the drive through and If I have it delivered, its literally just 20 steps away from the entrance. And I have to pay delivery fee and a 4$ tip too, imagine the price being doubled by just being right next to it.  Not complaining but just saying it'd be nice to actually have an option to go pick it up if you're literally just a few steps away. But hey, I still buy it and get it delivered just cause I'm your number 1 fan. 😅
Kitchens? Food trucks in my area. Mr beast burger and many many more out of one truck.
I can’t watch anything about Mr Beast
Yeah true the ruby Tuesday's near me is where Mr beast and like 3 other places come out of lol
I finally got to try beast burger and I'm legit in love with it.
in other words no more mom and pop places now all of our food comes from billionaires.  not a dig at mr. Beast, but the system in general,
me eating a beast burger : Tastes like honey- Mr beast: MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD HONEY TO SAVE MONEY
Delivery costs a fortune. I'll eat at home, cook my own food.
im guessing Mr spiffing brit will try to find Mr beast burger exploits for free burgers
this a good and interesting video.
Now tell us Mr Beast lore
I like you mr beast thank you for your charity work
Wait jimmy also launched the feastables which are a chocolate
It literally says this on doordash. Skip a video and read before you order.
HOW HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS PLACE😱😱?!
Mr. Beast years ago: I can count to 10,000 in one sitting and blow up watermelons or whatever Mr. Beast Now: I own a legitimate fast food restaurant chain, give away hundreds of thousands of dollars whenever I feel like it, and have started several highly successful environmental awareness donation projects. What about you?
sad thing mr beast burgers dont available on my country ;(
I rather  have Mc doodles ♡♡♡
Mr beast is racist he didn't have a restaurant in Alaska that's the place where I live
This video is 11 minutes 11 seconds long
How Mr beast gets so many money for his crazy intentions deserves it's own theory
It's so good mrbeast burger
I'm eating it
Great vid
4:14 in and i have NO IDEA what he's saying
Lol guess what matpat there's a mrbeast candy now call feastlbals lol mrbeast6000
So every beast burger tastes different cause it's made by different people?
wenn es das in Deutschland gebe.
I got beast burger so I don’t believe the title
I love Mr. beast Burger’s
I go to the Buba  for beast Burger
And now he's selling chocolate
Basically "amazon drop shipping" for food 🤣
Mrbeast is so yummy
where i live the mr beast burgers are raw the fries were cold and ya
Nice try convincing me But it ain’t gon work on me
You go too far
No no no no no no no. Ghost kitchens are awful. If they were going into small mom and pop's restaurants who are on the verge of closing and this is a way for them to supplement their income and keep their workers employed, that's one thing. There is no reason for a large national chain like Chili's to run ghost kitchens though. Full clarity, Chili's doesn't carry Mr. Beast Burger, but they do cook like 4 virtual brands on top of their own food, and it is too much. Kitchens are super backed up, and front of house staff is suffering. For a kitchen to be too busy to seat the restaurant and have to run to go only several shifts out of the week is detrimental to the majority of its staff who rely on people coming into the restaurant. I had to move on from my job of 12 years because of this, and I had it better than most. It's a vicious cycle, and serving is a dying profession because of it.
Still waiting for it in the UK two years after he launched Beast Burger lmao
it ok
today he made feastables  which is chocalate which is preety good what if he   di dthe same thing
Mr beast is a genius thats what we are sure of he never looses money he always got a plan when he does loose some money he is making a plan to get even more money and he is so good at youtube like the idea of how smart he is is just not real its out of this world im pretty sure he's iq and  those stuff are easily higher than anyone in history( but god  ) its unreal and im happy from that bc for some reason seeing someone better than me at something makes my mind learn from it easily so as long as he keeps making smarter and smarter moves i will also get better and better of how stuff works
BeastBurger is gonna take over the world. And I want that to happen.
.
You're so rude
MATPAT ITS MONEY NOT NAPKINS!!
Now mrbeast burger is the new McDonald
im a fan of mr beast
If I order a pizza from a famous person restaurant and it's Bertucci's, I won't be mad. I love Bertucci's.
So the whole "Ghost Kitchen" is basically a DLC for a restaurant.
New mr Beast video! Paying the FBI tu hint down the food theorists!
#FoodTheorySquad
So am i the only person who goes to the real restruant to get my (insert restraunt name here)!?
Mr. Ditcovitch will take food in place of rent

How come when a famous Yt post a comment and a bunch of people like it and a bunch of comments / just MY opinion
When I saw the thumbnail, all I can think about was "french fries" Thank you for listening to my Ted talk
Wow

Mr. Beast wants to die with $0 dollars in his bank account? Wait until he learns about generational wealth, otherwise, his great grandkids will hate him.
Subscribe for - Burger
I was watching this and the vid you were talking about WAS IN MY RECOMMENDED! 😎
Lol I ordered and kinda enjoyed a burger from one that popped up down the street from my house. All before I knew anything about who MrBeast is. Only recently seeing some of these videos did I hear the name, and seeing this thumbnail to put it together that I ordered from here a few weeks ago
The MrBeast Burger most local to me is a Red Robin lmao 🤣
its funny how it shown me the mr beast honey ad 😂
Bruh knowing I love so close to the referenced PA address is wacky
I was planning to go to bed after this, then I saw the animatronic nevermind
mr beast can i be in one of your mincraft videos i am also 9 years old
Ok I will order
Amazing
just ordered. yuuuum
did you know that cash dint made from paper so you can't say it taste like paper if it's don't made from paper.
Think this was illegal for a good reason, bet nobody knows why.
Trends come and go, if it stays, not a trend
LETSSS GOOO (i never liked him anyway, tommy's better)
8:56 "Give me rent!"
Lie he is just kind
Just gotta say, I love the Dr.Mario virus being used to represent covid
tmw your mr beast burger operates out of a Red Robin
Yo Mr Beast is a fucking genius
Moew
the only reason IN N OUT dont go franchise or stupidly open restaurants everywhere, is because they whan to control the Quality of burgers.
Taco Bell near my house was refusing drive thru orders. They only took door dash and mobile app orders. Brave new world.
Why do you think it’s a ghost kitchen it’s an actual kitchen I want there why are you so weird
.
It's 6:33 AM at my time and I'm starving, now I feel like I'm gonna die after watching this.
The boys tried it and they almost threw up
Our local two are garbage. They have 2 and 3 star reviews.
Didnt wasting money mr beast give your money
I rely wanted a mr beast burguer but i live on brasil and hear we dont have
by the way entro is kinda rude
That account of mr beast is not verified matpat
So you need to be a rich person already to start up a virtual restaurant due to needing the fame to find a partner kitchen to prep your food?
I hope Mr beast burger comes to Mongolia
I can't order i from cambodia love you
Ain’t it sad that he doesn’t know about the new for naff game security breach that just came out
This came out on my birthday
No   No you are lieing
Why are all your theories neoliberal hellholes????
Mine ship out a perkins
I will dislike (👎) this video!!
Hey food theorists how dare you saying that mrbeast burger is not existing? You so stupid you will be fired from mrbest burger restorant
Why this video is saying that mrbeast burger is not real
I like mrbeast burger
This video is so bad
Who TF is Mr. Beast?
Sad how no one knows how to cook anymore... a burger just off the grill vs A Burger delivered which has been sitting for 15-20 min   Huge difference but I am still going to buy Jimmy's burgers <3
Money is made of cloth and paper to make it stronger
I love your food it is the best:0
Woooooooow😏🤬
l0l
2:03 so sad Alaska doesn’t have mr.beast burger
But we really do get fucking slammed and these mr beast burgers are a fucking problem that need to go.
I was using this video as background noise and thought that he made up the restaurant name “buca di beppo”, turns out I was wrong 😭
I ordered food from Mr Beast burger it's really good and I hope that this restaurant will be around for a long time
Why deos he sound like craftee
DUDE YOU THREW AWAY 100S OF DOLLARS
Imagine MrBeast posting a comment on this- oh well uh- imagine MrBeast posting on a video that literally has this title
The problem with ghost kitchens however is quality. I've ordered from many ghost kitchen brands and the quality is less than the food coming out of the actual restaurant's menu. I don't think that the restaurant employees care as much abou the ghost brand as they do the brand they are selling.
This must only be a thing in America, we don't have anything here I Aussie like that (That I'm aware of)
So here in west springfield Massachusetts, our location is delivery only  So for a burger, fries ,and drink with all the fees, and a tip it’s over 26 dollars  Totally ridiculous  So he charges us and pays out thousands elsewhere nice  I do think it’s great he gives a ton of money away  However at my expense So knowing now that the overhead isn’t like normal restaurants, it makes it worse, that he’s charging as much as he is 😡
Lol
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
LOL! XD
I have picked up mr beast at ruby tuesday
Konichiwa
Why is my wingstop a beast burger 😭
Give me rent
DONT YOU BEING TALKING SMACK ABOUT MY BOI
I’ve read comments from other videos and they all say the same thing the consistency of the food will never be like a brick and mortar fast food chains like McDonald’s and Burger King
that hurt me in so many ways
There’s also, keep in mind, a lot of brands that with the virtual brand craze made their own offshoot virtual brand with extra items, exclusives, etc. Think thighstop or similar.
As someone who has gotten the mr beast burger several times trying to chase the quality of the first one, it does seem like the burgers themselves were made at outsourced places to only be gotten online… also $13 a burger
A youtuber named niko made Not McDonalds and yes thats the real name
Matpat: "Bupa de Bepo"  Me: "Bless you"  Matpat: "something something restaurant"  Me: "Wait, that's a real name for a restaurant?"
I like mr beast
This is crazyy
ok im order
Y u bully him
bullshit i work at red robins and now that the mr beast burgers came im doing even more work for the same pay
No, in actuality the MrBeast burgers isn't real. You are paying for a brand and not quality food. Like Nike. Using ghost kitchens means you have no control over quality, never going to inspect each kitchen, and have no idea what each location is actually cooking. In reality, it's nothing more than an asset flip which is generally frowned upon.
It might just be me, but Mr Beast seems to become a lot more available during COVID. I'm in a college town where the burger place is available, and it's pretty good I have to be honest. Didn't know it was operated like this.
Why have I never seen one if there are so many
You just want more subs mat
The Red Robin near me sold me a burger as MrBeast Burgers.  Not knowing that it is what it is, I went ahead and paid $50 for 2 burger meals to be delivered. Looks like I'm the idiot here.  My Red Robin was informed that I was simply not going to support this gimmick. Customer lost. I'm sure they will be fine without me, but idc.
But think about it he pulled this off before the pandemic, he didn’t just maintain 300 locations in a month it took atleast a year and it’s spooky.
He says it’s not it’s sponsored but look at the hashtags
Does this mrbeast burger restaurant still give away money?
7:53 "Of couse those bloody yanks would take the island"
Food theorists I got a packet of veggie rings and it said on the back do not purchase this bag is opened just because it might be mouldy on the front of the packet is Little veggie people not suspicious at all
It’s is real
Man, I feel like mr.beast is one day going to make the economy make money have no value anymore 😅
Sometimes I wish I lived in America
Mr. beast Burger is real
WASTE OF MONEY -1000 social credit
Who make this is a liar
Do episodes like this count as food theories? There more food interesting facts.
Still. In The Future It Will Go Down So. McDonald's,Kentucky Fried Chicken(KFC), Starbucks And Other Restaurants Will Win
What It's All Paper. Waste
I just noticed that the intro has freddy fazbear's pizza in
The burger is a good fast-food burger and the Mr beast fries were the worst thing I've ever tried
Wait... Did you eat and throw out money.......
Liar Mr beast Burger is real there's literally in Mr beast Burger in my city in New York like there's literally one located over here in New York
food theory should start a virtual resturant
The reason Mr Beast has to expand locations is because they only offer delivery and delivery drivers don't deliver 15 mile deliveries for 1 hamburger due to a $3 base pay from DoorDash with a $2 customer tip.  A 15 mile delivery for $5 in pay means that driver (after expenses) is making about $2 per hour in pay.  It's not just about the cost of gas, but a 15 mile delivery means 30 because of the drive back and in most areas a 30 mile delivery will take 1 hour to drive.  Would anyone in America work for $2 per hour?
I swear if there is a fazbear restaurant, I won't eat at another place again 🤣😂
there's no beast burger here in Alaska that's sad it closed
I liked the joke in the beggining
Imagine if y'all could hire small, local businesses to be your ghost kitchen though. A whole network of small businesses getting some extra money
1:39  and the guy who remade squidgames
Order now like jimmy said
Halal?
Half the locations are fakes and have no product quality thanks to VR and ghost kitchens
My mom went there
Alaska is un lucky
Stoppppp
This is a good idea, but honestly why are we wanting to buy food just because theres a celebritys face attatched to it? Idk maybe im old school but id much rather eat food from a nice restaurant or chef that i can assure knows a lot about food than eat tyga bytes 🤣
Beast burger™️ is real but how dare you betray mrbeast his burgers 🍔 taste like Burger King ngl
OMFG yes!
Booooooooo FAKER
When I was doordashing earlier this year I got an order for Beast burger and it sent me to a Red Robin and I was so confused.  Now I know 🤣
Lie
I love Mr. big burger
ok
Wow thinking smarter not harder
As an uber eats driver some thoughts on this..........most common thing i have said while doing these orders........where TF is this restaurant..and the second issue I have found once......there is a problem in my area that a small local restaurant somehow got mistakenly listed as a kitchen for at least one of these ghost restaurants and is now dealing with at least 6 angry customer/driver issues a day.
how is this mrbeast person still this rich? ive watched a couple of his videos and omg thats a lot of money being used on top of being given away
It's a theory. It might 😵‍💫😵‍💫🤯
9:56 try sister location
Me beast burger is REAL

McDonald can't take over Philippines because of red bee
Restaurants aren't the only businesses that can act this way.   There are airlines that outsource the hiring of pilots, operation of aircraft, and certification to other airlines, but booking is made through the original airline and the aircraft (usually) have its livery on them. This model is called a "virtual airline".
Wow Lily come down while my boys gonna die happy life you got to want it kind a happy life happy life happy life now bro don’t worry don’t think you want it I’m gonna find you and hunt you down you might want to go to Mexico mannequin Mexico I want you down on the kidding but I talking about Anna kidding but I talk about the Mr. beast Burger to work for them how much you want but that be bad might be good to be comfortable you are you do are you do you do it calm down
I know plenty of people say it's bad but I actually liked it quite a bit when I tried one awhile back.
If he handed me that much money I’d be wondering if it was a joke or a prank and then probably cry and want to hug him
My nearest beast burger is like at a red robin or sum lmao
It's not available in my country 😭😭😭😭
What
29
The intro 🤣👉👈
MrBeast be like: Hahaha, you finally have found my secret evil plans!.
Sadly I’m not in USA 🤧😭
Your mom is not real
Oh my god Buca di Beppo is a real restaurant, I thought that he just said random syllables to create a fake restaurant to use as an example 🙈
That’s why I havn’t seen one
unsub to food theoRists
This is some big brain bussiness model.
It’s good food. Had no idea it was related until I dug into it.
Hey MatPat in kindergarten two Nugget uses 100 nuggets to enter the nugget cave. In game theory you said hey would need billions of nuggets to survive the fall. However when the kindergarteners fell in the hole with out the nuggets they still live. Is 100 nuggets enough and if not how squishy are the 100 nuggets?
Hi
Mr beast burger is so delicious 😋
That is hardly the first free restaurant. I volunteer at one in my city, and we have been operational for over 25 years; we give food away to our clients every day.  We get people in the community to give us money and food, then volunteers and staff cook it up and it goes out the front door; we used to let the clients in and let them eat inside, but that changed with the first COVID-19 lock-down.  We do not have a drive-through as most of our clients can not afford a car, but thankfully there is a bus stop only a few hundred metres away.  We also have a food bank where people can get shelf-stable stuff to take home.
Hey i saw you on mr beast shorts and you BOOOOOM
9:53 FNAF Sister Location: Am I a mother fucking joke to you?!
I saw matpat eat it in mrbeast's impossible burger
Icecream mcguy -the turkey resteraunt- good name isn’t it
As a DD delivery driver I know all about ghost restaurants
After all that mr beast burger we are going to need a mr beast gym
Old and cold food, long wait times for delivery, and way overpriced because of the order service, 35$ for two meals that are old and soggy fries and no drinks
Your food is terrible! Ando very expensive,poor taste !!!!!!!!!!!👎
Omg Mr best commented
sheeeesh
See a need fill a need...kudos
In N Out isn't a good comparison. They are methodical about opening new locations.
How do you stop the delivery driver from eatting parts of your food?
This won’t last as people will realize the difference in quality and taste from having it made at all these random locations. 300 completely different restaurants making the same burger you didn’t think there will be major deviations ha
Mr beast burger is tasty as you think
I absolutely love the business theory episodes.  Hey, may be that’s a new channel idea. Business theory theory. Nice ring to it.
theres also george lopez tacos
I tried marias cookies and its actually really good
Wait
My son love your burgers
Open theory burger
I just ordered for the first time on DoorDash a minute ago in Wilson NC never knew there was one. But I respect it because most places don’t show any love near us. Update: I couldn’t finish it it wasn’t that great the burger was OK kind of dry but the beast fries or wtf ever they’re called ok superseded I kept them down
*Filipino Gamers Has Entered The Chat*
I saw this on my doordash as a new restaurant in my area, I didn't even realize it was his at first lol
MrBeast
"What a waste of money" MrBeast Burgers: *im for free*
I’ve ordered Tyga Bites multiple times and had no idea it had to do with the rapper 😂🤣
I can’t believe Buca di bepo is a real name for a restaurant
When are we going to do a collaboration?
Mr beast
Virtual are not the future for one reason who do you get to come fix your order if they get it wrong also has done option for writing these restaurants not really you go through ubereats the most of these and they don't have an option for rating they don't even have a Google location so you can't have a restaurant with put a Google location so you can actually have customer feedback that's why I chose never to eat another ghost restaurant again
Ok so I live near 250 W. Bridge st... I drive past it omw to work..
That's not a theory it's already been confirmed the that it is a ghost kitchen and I do not trust ghost kitchens and I don't trust ghost kitchens anymore I had trusted 2 ghost kitchens his was the first and I have to say it tasted know better than Burger King it wasn't special I would argue that Burger King tastes slightly better and then there was another burger place I tried that you get through ubereats through Burleson Texas on Wilshire it's called Burger did and it was absolutely disgusting yes it's greasy like it's supposed to be but it tastes like they used old grease it made my stomach upset the bad thing is you have no way of reviewing our rating these restaurants so you're at the mercy of whoever you're getting to make your burger
bro your food is good
Bro your food is so hood
#Mattdaddytrend
I think they should have to pay workers more if they're doing more work this is why the world will always be split the rich get richer as they make the poor poorer
Jimmy is
I love beast burger
Food theory I HATE when u said “what a waste of money”
Except me beast burger Is fire
He was helping small places like highway 55
I would but if mr beat didn’t charge 14 bucks for a regular burger and fries
I’m jk
Your lieing
This is really cool. Big ups to Mr. Beast for evolving the restaurant industry. It’s like dropshipping for food.
Hi YouTube and mrbeast
First of all it’s free
XXX *VS* Mrbeast
the dislikes are from mrbeast stans that thought he was going to hate mrbeast burger
I've been watching MatPat's old videos lately, and coincidentally, they are all more facts than thoeries. Maybe that's Youtube doing, but hey, that's just a theory, of...me.
Ooh that’s why Red Robin is mrbeast burger
Mr best  has a resturan i Do not trust you
9:32 i have 8 :D
I just ordered for the first time. Super excited! 🤣
Mr beast nope
Would you buy me a car
zx
Got some food from Mr beast let me judge 👨‍⚖️ how good it be
and now eminem has opened "mama's spaghetti"
Too young to order from my phone well don't got a credit card so uh yay?
um i have two subs thank-you very much! im expecting three soon
I order a burger
he just made me increase my respect for mr beast. he is such an amazing man and so humble, a god amongst men
Mr beast is not fake
I at one for lunch today i ate the beast burger 2 cookies and karls grill cheese
Exactly what I thought it was.
I watched the video mrbeast he didn't put the money in the bogus put it you just gave away money
I know that couldn't have been a toaru reference in the intro 👀
The one by me is connected to "On The Border"
0:19 matDonald's
I love how they think it's still its food safe. I have a cook that sneezed right on mr beast burger delivery. Only because the kid works 70 hours a week.
Mr beast burger isn't even real
It,s real mean
could you test if blue yellow and red are actually the primary colors.
6:37 why do all of his restaurants start with a B🤨
This is real
I work in Buca di Beppo/ in a ghost kitchen, and this is very meta 😂
5:20 None of them deliver to where I am In fact I don’t think the developers of the app know what these restaurants are
That crap look like it’s from the pantry
Imagine being a cook who gets a shitty paycheck and lives week to week depending on that check and now you don't just get that shitty pay to cook for your restaurant but now you get 2 or more jobs in one that you still receive your shitty pay for! Awesome, I say we take a little more care of the people keeping these places running.
Mr beast burger is real
But he said free,is not free
It is Mr beast burger but does it looks like it and taste like it.It is make by italian restaurant that makes italian food.Better make the quality better
I love the taste of paper
Too bad it isn't any good.  But yeah, for all I know the random ghost kitchen that made my burger just sucks and other ones are great.
here in the UAE, ghost kitchens are very common and popular
You ruined your own chance of ever getting Mr. beast Burger
Yummy
It's legit Perkins... Garbage food rebranded
MatPat to release Matty's Patties.
Im pretty sure the nearest Beast Burger to me is at a bowling alley
Yeah but who supplies ingredients? Would that not change the taste of the food from location to location?
XD I didn't realize there was a food theory Channel HAH! Honestly though.. how does Mr beast do this? Mr beast and a genie: Genie: you have three wishes Mr beast: I Wish For More Wishes Genie: sorry.. but I can't do that Mr Beast: I ask for infinite money every day Genie: Done Mr beast: *holds up a gun* Now.. Give Me As Much Wishes As I Do Money Genie: *gasp*
I did a beast butger door dash run once. It confused me cause the app don't tell me I was picking up from Apple bees.. it just said a beast burger should be there. To my surprise. . It actually was. But I could see a scenario where I might canceled that run confused.. cause it tells you restaurant name... with beast burger your just hoping the GPS is accurate on that location.. it didn't bother to state. The host. Name. It's important for order speed and accuracy. He really would be some kinda beast... under mining an apps friendliness to the public for prophets.. adds think 🤔
ハンバーガーはとても美味しいです！私は2時間運転しなければならなかったのに...
Wait, so you're telling me that MrBeast is using his platform to save restaurants failing under the weight of the pandemic? How out of character. /s
It’s real because if you look up on Google it says the nearest yeah

Bro it's not even a waist of money it's free ;-;
to be fair, in n out is a bit of an unfair comarison becouse most of those 66 years it was in california only
Ybut................ you mention safety. Such as the safety you the person putting the food in your mouth would want to employ.   I'm not personally the type to just order from a restaurant I've never been to or heard of. I'm unlikely to order from a restaurant that gets poor reviews or has low health safety standards and no way in the world would I ever order from a ghost kitchen serving out of a kitchen I wouldn't normally order from. It's just common sense.
I only have 8 subscribers am Gamerxt
Omg I want a beast burger 🍔
I feel like quality control is going to be an issue. Just ordered, packaging was amazing, burger was warm but fries were cold like refrigerated cold and everything just seemed thrown together.

Only Mr. BeastBurger is here in Philly right now lol but I’m fine with that
This isn’t *JUST A THEORY!!* but it’s a fact
🍔
I doubt you will see this with so many followers, but here goes.   Last night my kids realized that there was a place here in Midland that offered Mr. Beast burgers.   They were so excited and begged me to order.   We are all huge fans and thought the experience would be great.   We placed the order through Uber Eats.   When the order arrived, it was incorrect to begin with.   Then we realized that both the burgers and fries were cold.  The fries were burnt and the burgers were flavorless.    It was an awful experience.   My kids literally cried and they were so disappointed.   I tried to explain to them that it was not your fault, but they didn't want to hear that.   Anyways, we will absolutely never order another Mr. Beast burger again.   These burgers and fries made McDonald's look like something made for Royalty.   We will still be huge fans of yours and support you through the mech store and will watch all of your videos, just not partake in eating your food.  Please let me know if there is anything you can do to make it right to my kids.
this is exactly what I thought lol
Oh I cant believe mrbeast saw this video
Unless doordash keeps fucking people it won't happen Maddie pattie

This video will probably disliked a lot and the comments could have threats maybe
ITS REAL
I wish I had seen this sooner so I understood what a startup that contacted me a while back was trying to do. I don't know if this 'virtual restaurant brand' model will last, but it is interesting to see how this industry hurt by the pandemic is evolving.
I have not watched you in months

Don’t say that to mrbeast
8:33 really clever how you reversed the background clip to go from open to close. I didn't notice it at all the first time
Tried once and that was one time too many. It was horrible, and by the reviews on their Facebook page, I am far from alone.
Mrbeast I'm a chef in a cruise ship now applying cook from Philippines
Mrbeast I'm a teppanyaki chef you have vacant I want to apply I'm working in a cruise ship from Philippines
God of restaurant bestow mrbeast
Stop complaining
It is real
your right. the address for the nearest mr beast burger to me is actullay the address to a diffrent restaurant
Me What better then sun glasses 4:30 2 sun glasses
Omg stop lieing
How is he always right or either very smart with his theory’s
There’s ghost kitchens operating out of established restaurants but there’s also ghost “delivery only” food courts for maybe 3 or 4 years now.  It used to be just independent shops but lately I’ve seen some brick and mortar restaurants transfer their deliveries to the warehouses (probably ensuring higher profit from delivery and consistent in-person customer experience for the regular restaurant).  These hubs are obnoxious, one place sells chicken and one sells burgers and they’re at the same address but if I want to order both I’m required to pay for 2 deliveries. Also, consistency and quality were lacking. Also, the one nearest me operates on a busy street and there’s no parking so the delivery drivers just park in the middle lane and run across traffic trying to get run over.   To be fair, it looks like mr beast burger is in a ghost kitchen in a restaurant near me but I ate there once and it was crappy so not sure if it was the menu or the cooks so I might not be willing to find out.
apparently mine delivers from a red robin’s which i never knew
MrBeast burger is literally the best thing I've ever eaten
9:56  I think that kinda already exists
I doubt that his food contains any preservatives because, why would MrBeast do that?
Fake
Why is this guy saying its fake
Click bait
epicc
The closest mr beast burger is in a bowling alley
Me reacting the the title Me:Bruh I don’t care what you think beast burger is REAL Edit:(me after) oh so you think it’s real My mind:good
Mrbeast: Gives burgers made of money away like its nothing Everyone: Wow thanks! But just so you know, that isn't a very sound buisness practice
i ate mr  beast burger its DELISHUS
I don't like mrbeast
The food wasn't good. I'm sorry but the fries had no salt and soggy and rhe bread was falling apart.   I went there once
I'm sure if Scott Cawthon wanted to he could've had ghost kitchens delivering pizzas with the fnaf logo printed on the box.
But when I ordered it, it was pretty good.... You can dislike this.
Can I order it in India, Kolkata?
Him: it kinda tastes like paper me: umm yea maybe there is money below the patty
4:31 I like how he put extra glasses
It only makes sense that In n’ Out has 342 locations because there only in California
i would work there if i could
What's FNAF explain on film theory
I knew it, I FREAKING KNEW IT
I never thought about it that way. I was looking for the location of my local mrbeast burger and couldn't find it. I only found a different burger place. Now I realize what it is. THANK YOU FOOD THEORY!
Ihate this  video   is not fake
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YOOOOOOOOOOOO its very good
Maybe he just hired a bunch a people ._.
What does Robert Earl have with the letter B? I'm surprised his son is not named Bobbie
I know I'm late but Guy Fieri also has a virtual kitchen through the same system
My god it's a taco
Imagine looking out your door and you see a robot bear delivering your chicken nuggets.
Amazing
Leave mrbeast alone
Quit YouTube
i want a beast burger but i cant get one :(
How dare you do this
H
mr beast is the best i even subbed to him he is a legend he gives  away tons of money for the right reasons and or good causes so dont believe this random person it will spread all of the person showing this video are rumours mr beast a legen dont be mean you anonymous person
Shut up
It’s the mr beast from YouTube
Nce explanation of ghost kitchen.  Have fun and success
I’m so used to mat pat’s theories that I can know where he’s going halfway through an episode and just stop
Man I need free money lol
I have question who win Jollibee vs McDonald vs Mrbeast burger
ya that we knew
No loser YouTubeSuper chill
Aren’t you two brothers? Or am I crazy.
Mat pat on film theory make a theory of troll hunter rise of the titans
So in words your burger was probably made at your local pizza hut 😂
The real winners are the restaurant owners because they own the real estate
Never mind it’s not fake
Wait
This video is fake
God bless everyone Jesus loves u
Yep, the Red Robin I work at has THREE ghost brands, and I tell every single DoorDash driver who is confused by it "yeah I hate it too I think it's greedy". I even asked the GM of our little group of stores "hey this seems needlessly greedy, right?"
Their website doesn't work
Sir i love mrbeast you
Hey if this was true i would freak out. But i went there before so uhhhh.  Edit : Lol you thought ofc it's a Ghost Resturaunt. But idc because it's a good thing ! \=
This just constructive criticism you need to have more influence on your ghost restaurants because I tried it and it wasn't that by McDonald's and burger kings standards but when you compare to five guys or even my least favorite in and out burgers just constructive criticism because I know it is not your fault because it mainly the restaurants that you have make your fervor Dino feel stressed out means you're using another restaurant so I know it's the restaurants you're getting to make the burgers so I thought I'd do some constructive criticism to give you some feedback
What a nice way to rant on mrbeast burger threw a title
That was actually brilliant
I orederd it is was good
it is real
Does Jimmy earn all the money from all the restaurants or not ?
!!!!!  Nnnnnnnno
MCDONALD'S
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you stop focusing on every single detail of every single YouTube of every single game just spoken to just do not focus on my favourite YouTube are so rude I was just terrible state
2:51 he um... makes more money?
No No No😠😠
Liar liar no no liar unsubscribe
Well FNAF Real Life version would probably have a slight change to something often heard in a Fast Food Restaurant. "Let's eat, Kids!" foregoing the comma to become: "Let's eat kids!"   I have got a question about Virtual Restaurant Concepts though: Does the American Cartel Office ever work? Because from an Outsider's perspective they don't seem to be all that concerned with Monopolies. Albeit it's their sole reason for existence to prevent these...
Why is no one talking about how dope a food theory restaurant would be?
I mean was in it kinda obvious
Its laughing at how ridiculously made up bucca di beppo is and its actually real tf 🤣😂
Mrbeast wouldn't fake his videos :(
Mrbeast 6000
It is real
THAT 'S NOT TRUE
I ordered chicken tenders from a ‘new’ place called “Coop and Run”…. I was curious where it was located and asked the DoorDash driver… “oh,  it’s just O’Charleys”
3:13 to 4:13 A different restrunt is making the food to be call Mr Beast burger 🍔 and the other people
The best name he could think of. Buka de beppo
My cousin got a burger and said it sucked
11:11, noice timing pal 🤣
Matpat has developed Stockholm syndrome for FNAF at this point.
Lol I'm just watching Mrbeast burger vidd
The place was shady from the start, probably as cringy as Mr beasr
Wow I thought this was going to be a dark secret but this is kind of cool
I ordered one it good BUY IT OR ILL BUY A DEATH WARRANT FOR YOU
I got even better, it's just wings operates out of chilli's, but you know who else operates out of chilli's? Mr beasts burgers!
No joke I actually subscribed with my tongue just now!
Just ordered the mrbeast combo and cookies it’s coming from on the border…
Ghost kitchens are fine and all but one thing I'm wondering.. Does the food taste the same from one "location" to another? Because if they "rent" from different kitchens, then there has to be differences, even if they use the same base recipe..?
I wonder if each location makes the food taste different though. Like, is a Mr.beast burger in NC different than one in CA? or for that matter, is one in Charlotte different than one in Greensboro?
Lol I got an Uber eats ad
Your just jealous of mrbeast because your just capping it I'm disappointed at you
Now repeat after me Matt pat is always wrong!!!👌👌
Is there mr beast burger on PHILIPPINES
OMG I ORDERED COOKIES FROM MARIAHS COOKIES WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IT WAS. JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A RANDOM COOKIE PLACE NEARBY SINCE THEYRE EVERYWHERE HERE. It was actually super good.
Food theory is the worst! In the intro y’all said it’s worth money! And it’s free! 🤨🧐😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩🥺😢😭😤😠😡🥶😬😯😦😧😮😮😲😪😵🤢🤮🤮🤮
10:19 He spelled Karl wrong lol.
Is mrbeast richer than Bill gates
Your just ruining peopls life
This channel is fake
Mrbeast is REAL
Not because I tried to went there on maps
I still got to restaurants
2:33
this guy is lying
There would always be problems of every domain expecially restaurants. People expect things to be perfect from the beginning. There would be difficulties but some of them would solve. The order didn't even is send by MrBeast Company. It isn't the owner fault expecially the situation of food that are over cooked etc. Everything is possible.
Flicking genius
Kid your just jelly and a hater of mr beast
If it wasn’t real then he would not build the place lol
Ngl I’m now very tempted to start a virtual restaurant despite just being a random teenage girl LMAO
I will never recover from the fact that mrbeast vows to die with $0.00 in his bank account
i knew Mr. Beast would comment on this
Wat
You are junking 💩
This really isn't a theory though, it's just explaining how the system works
I worked at a restaurant that turned into a ghost kitchen half way through its existence
Oh yeah totally forgot about this
MAKE MATPAT BURGER ITS NOT JUST A BURGER, ITS A MATPAT BURGER
Yes, great idea. The winners are industrialized food with no transparency. The clear losers are people who like to cook great food locally and people who like to eat great food locally.
Plot twist: He’s laundering drug money
Imagen nightmare chica just giving you your food
Honestly I'd agree this seems like part of the future, but goddammit, delivery fees are way too expensive.
International shipping to west Africa pls.
Mrs beast burger is real
We went to Bravo once. It was terrible service. Shouldn’t have tipped them.
Its real...
i thought when I was  seeing this video you were insulting but its just my mine
How long until matpat burger
Who cares? Imma try it hehe
Its real bruh!
I really need to try a dream burger.  I’m a MEGA dream fan
Wait, thks isnt a theory

Hi :)
You not boss of mrbeast he the boss of you
C o o k i e
He is a genius
The ocharleys I work at is a ghost kitchen for a seafood chain called "dockside Charlie's".  I looked at the menu, and we prepare things in this kitchen that I wish was on the regular ocharleys menu!
Wiz Khalifas restaurant is good
This is the cap store
Lol i spent 70 bucks there and it legit after i placed my order, told me to find a blue trailor that says reefs kitchen on it which was 20 mins away... I found it and the security guard there told me he closed up shop over an hour ago... The website said that location was gonna be open another 4 hrs I just went home hungry and out of 70 dollars :/
Is it halal
Mr Beast Burger is good.

I like how this food theories cannel suddenly makes alot more sense, very smart sense honestly. Which means it wasn't just random luck, but a smart business strategy
I ordered on the wrong day when they where too busy in California
Ya I don’t like mr beast
Mr beast bruger should come in india
Everytime i see this clout culture garbage i understand more and more why boomers hate our generation.  Undeserved money.
you have wipers at home dum dum not you mr beast
Who else clicked to see if mrbeast would comment here
Freddy Fazbear's would make a great restaurant/escape room combo.
Come on down to MatPita and have a Marvel Super Hero sandwich and some Five Night's at Freddy's Fries.
Just hearing about the giveaways makes my heart hurts so much it makes me want to wish I was american a bit....nah no free stuff can beat jollibee so I guess ill pass
ME : SHUT UP THE FOOD THEORISTS, THIS IS NOT A FIGHT A GIVEAWAY
Iv heard “mr beasts” food is really bad and or raw 😀 😐 🤤🥴 yummy yum yum.
How did he go from mrbeast to fnf
Mrbeast is awesome and I know he can do it
The well-off resolution spontaneously book because coach formerly cure without a placid tomato. rural, square flax
This seem more like hate video
I saw mr Beast burger bags at my local buca de bepo and now I understand
I didn't understand much, but he talking about Italy soo I'm happy
Well, good to know Doordash wants to try to cook food themselves.  Given the amount of problems I had with Doordash for just 13 orders, that is all the more reason for me to avoid them.  Admittedly I'm just a drop in the bucket, but because of that, I will not be a supporter of these ghost kitchens.
I can make my own burger restaurant in the future
The beast burger in my area is a Red Robin!!!!!!!!!!
This is what we think   Also I am not in ur country so I cant get onee :(
Imagine someone opened a Freddy's in real life and you order something and Freddy Fazbear shows up with pizza , just you know don't order at night you never know what will happen !!!
Is real

Food theory should make a ghost kitchen I can see it now "Theory burger" or idk. Lol.
Your comments or rude mean political
Yeah☺☺
What's the price per share of Mr. Beast Burger? I not only like the idea of investing in the burgers (through buying em) but also purchasing shares.
waiting for one to be added in my area 805
I lev in japan but i was born in amareca
Cant wait for when he buys a ship and gives away a planet
I spent 40 dollars and my Uber driver (my boyfriend, yes we did test this) only got 8. Not mrbeasts fault more than likely. But goddamn that was a short return! 😂
Whoever edited this video was AWESOME!

I don't know who MrBeast is outside of the Honey extension ads, but today I found out Buca di Beppo isn't far from me lol. I thought you made that place up initially.
Food theorists kinda looks like scott cawthon fnaf idk but like the character he does lookd like scott
i love the Mr beast burger fries( the normal ones)
WHY STOP YOU MAKE EVEREYONE FEEL
Matpat should start another channel called music theory and analyze lyrics and make theorys on them
Why is nobody talking about guys and GHOULS
Mr  beast I love your videos
I hate you the room
The Food Theorists: Level 1 bond
>:(  MR BEAST IS SO GOOD
Huh. We have a Mr. Beast restaurant in Calgary. None of the other 3 though. I wonder what that restaurant actually is (the name isn't showing on Google maps)
Huh. So like ghost writers but as kitchens instead of authors.
omg mrbeast do you play roblox if you do please add me

we are from virginia but are currently in Iowa for my husband's training with a new job - we saw mr beast burgers pop up on doordash last night and had to try it because it isn't where we are. It was pretty dang good! We watched where the dasher was when they picked up the food, and apparently, it was at a red robin - wild, man
I like Karl's Style but I don't order
Oh sorry

I got mr beast burger and it’s very clear when a restaurant doesn’t have their name tied to the quality of the food they don’t care how it comes out. It was disgusting
“Real” waste of money 0:11
Go away mrbeast
Sure you can tell us what Mr beast burger is but what is your problem he made it for a video and money what's so different
Order now
Ok first of all why is mrbeast burger look like your school lunches.
Short answer:he’s rich, and he has a big heart
There is something that stands in the way in between me and my restaurants. A whole bunch of unnecessary corporate middle men.
Day20 of looking for hate comments
He is a genious
Plss don't bash mr beast
No Mr.Beast, I HATE 🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔 BURGERS

#NOTSPON
Lmao, the Mr. Beast ghost kitchens in my area are just little trailers in the middle of random parking lots downtown. Definitely wasn't what I was expecting when I went to pick up but it was still pretty good, it's just too bad all of them are out of my delivery zone or I would probably order again.
am i supposed to know who this guy is
I like pepper ._
MRBEAST HATER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!  Jk XD
Don’t listen he’s lying don’t listen he’s lying it does exist I ate there before the cookies are amazing you should try them
Mr beast will go down as a legend man if he dies it’s gonna hurt everybody
Hater
I’m watching this video after just finishing a mr beast burger for the first time. It felt like a summer camp lunch they just give the kids because it’s the cheapest thing they can give out. I’d be generous in giving it a 2/10. I was super hyped for this so it’s kinda disappointing
It is real I can ordinary it
My back hurts
Anybody ready for Morgz burger
This youtuber sucks
Ahh that makes sense! Dog haus, red robin, and tgi fridays have been doing the ghost kitchens for months!!  And you also forgot about guy fieris flavor town!
POV: you work In a restaurant that uses a ghost kitchen and instead of making more money you just are expected to do more work.
Me who ate at Bravo 2 weeks ago...😳 My brother did say something about Mr. Best burgers, but I didn't think that BRAVO OF ALL PLACES would have it...🧏🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️
If i ordered Wendy’s and find 100k on my card the next day imma be like 😟

A Fnaf restuarnt would be killer

Liar. It's on uae
i tried mr beast restaurant it's yummy
How is this a food theory and not just public information
I basically eat these atleast twice a week because I force my mom to get it, I would say get a MrBro burger
IS FAKE BUT IM GOING TO ORDER
But when corona is over, how will those ghost restaurants continue their business? Cuz those ghost restaurants will be making their own menu.
I’m surprise Mr. beast din’t give money for napkins
I had the burger it was actually good, but the fries was trash way too much ketchup
I now fear the word buca de beppo
its not free but its super cheap
Yeet
Wtf there is a food theory now
Imagine if Matpat made a restoraunt#theory
I knew this because I get my wings from chili's Thursday door dash its just wings
I definitely rather eat dine in if I can. The food is way More fresh rather get it ordered
0:19  anyone notice anything?
Okay now we need the Krusty Krab ghost kitchen
Pov 2025: Mr beast buys the whole loterry

Wow man is real not fake he is still rich you dont no and thats is bad

BEAST BURGER!!!
Just looked up my local Mr Beast Burger. The ghost kitchen is at Red Robin!
I went to the one called brio it is some of the best food ever
They are all located at Golden Corral in my area
MrBeast burger is the supreme clothing of food. Like meh quality but really expensive. You are buying the experience of eating MrBeast burgers not the food itself.
A similar model has been on trial here in India for a couple of years now and I know a company which owns like 7 brand across cuisines running from different cloud/ghost kitchens across the country. It's called Rebel Foods Pvt. Ltd. India. A very interesting business model to study!
Is this some kind of joke or something
I almost unsubscribeed from u cuase i thought u were hating on his restaurant
YES
Who cares at least the recipe is by MrBeast and if he opened a real building someone else would have made it.... Which is still happening with these ghost kitchens... The only thing different is that the building is not new😂😂😂
I love that we have a food theory channel.
I think it's a human trafficking ring
My mom ordered his food for a TikTok and it was super good. The fries are really good there and so are the burgers. Good job MrBeast and it’s not a waste of money.
Love his philanthropy, makes me smile.:)
Video: virtual restruant  Thumbnail: Not real
The people that went there are so desperate wow
He's like drop shipping burgers lol
Beast basically saved business while making his own
Delivery and Drive thru is the most used ways to get fast food by what I know.
Let's be real here: buca di beppo is just really fun to say
I'm going to get mrbeast burger tmr lol
Mr. Beast come to Phoenix. I want to try your burgers.. I'm Native American you can try Our Frybread. Lol.

I going to try this
Eat this not That has reached out to MrBeast Burger for comment but has not received a response yet.
If you’ve EVER thought about trying Mr. Beast Burger, don’t. Not only was the just bad, but they got EVERY aspect of each bit of the order wrong. The “beast style fries” came as microwave Oriya fries with nothing else on them. They also won’t refund..

Matt I have some interesting, resteraunt related secrets I'd like to share with you related to this episode, but is actually a guarded secret that I got my hands on. How would I contact you with this info, because I do not want myself or my informant getting this info traced.
All foods isn’t real lol
They stole my fucking money
Legit knew I wasn't going to learn anything new still watched the video
buca di beppo is my new favorite restaurant name
That makes sense
I ordered  there once.. The burgers and fries in Central Indiana  weren't  that great.  😫
“What a waste of money” Me: there is money in it....what a waste of 100 dollars
mr.beast is right
He's literally just dropshipping burgers lol
When you gonna open a food theory fast food chain? Food Theory is a good name for a fast food restaurant already.   Rotating themed menus. Special themed party menus. Science!   Channel cross-over themed menus.. Freddy Fasbears Food Theory Themed Dinner Party Kit.
#notspon
When you can’t have mr beast burger cause your parents dont like or trust grub hub or door dash or anything like that
So can you go there in person and order
The problem is controlling the quality of the food being delivered. Only adjustment I would like to see from uber eats is displaying If a kitchen is a 'ghost' or serves more then one menu on the app.
I Dont See Whats Wrong

In my country, there is something like this, but these are supermarkets. They have a real location but it works kinda like a "warehouse" cuz it's only for online shopping from the app... Their logo kinda looks like Doordash but I'm gonna blame it on being a Latin American brand. In my opinion, this is brilliant!
And if you look at Mr. Beast menu, they have "freshly baked cookies" for desert. What an interesting video
https://youtu.be/G-T3qKl6y-c
Of course it's not what I think, it's a front for his money laundering business.
I learnt more than what I learn at school just from this 11 minute video.
Lol we didn’t re-skin a Buca Di Beppo or film it in Texas.
@MrBeast YES MASTER
I neeeeeeedddd mr beast burger
Fake I went to this Mr beast burger place
can you do theorist about FNF

I hope mrbeast burger will be the best and the most famous
Mrbeast does have good burgers
Mrbeast is the best person ever
I really want MrBeast burger, but there is no locations where I live, I'll probably have to wait until this summer when I can travel more :(
Ngl i get you meant no harm, and I love your videos, but I see a lot of hate comments on Twitter to Mr.Beast burger that gets information from this video.
I hate you cause I know for a fact mr. beast doesn’t fake or lie on vids
"OMG ARE U SERIOUS BROTHER!? :O"
And instead of bravo charging 20 dollars for a burger he and his partners would charge 45 dollars

You could do the same video for food products and brands too. 'Contract manufacturing'; how to produce a product without a factory.
Why
Mr.best is better than you
Wait, does that mean that the ghost kitchen knows all the recipes of all the other celebrity food brands? Can't that be used as a reverse card if something goes wrong?
sigh
Hey can you do a film theory on I'm a gummy bear my child's very interested in that
I’m getting some at Saturday =]
I know this video is old, but it would have been nice if apps like door dash would tell their dashers about this. I had an order for Tyga Bites, never heard of it before and when the app's GPS took me to a bertuchi's I canceled the order because I thought the app was wrong and that something was going on. Plus does not help that when I looked up Tyga bites google told me it was based in CA not in DE where I was working at the time
Dude, the one I ordered from in Sacramento actually WAS a Buca di Beppo
Interesting video, how can 8.4k dislike it when it's err fact and not a disrespect to Mr.Beast or others  Good on them! Honestly, if it was available here, I would order since we had bugger all delivery options during lockdown!
Yeah I work at a Denny’s and we ghost kitchen for a online restaurant called the burger den it’s really weird but it works and people seem to like it
shop mrbeast .
I thought everyone already knew this...
Yu
He is a genius .
There is one in Toronto.
U got some mrbeast burger in this fnaf video
Hamburger😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
Matpat: Hey! Here's a fun fact Matpat 11 min later: But that's just a theory!
So wait...is MrBeast the ultimate internet communist?
DELETE YOUR VIDEO
I bet the free restaurant vid is on your recommend list
I had MrBeast burger and fries... TRASH.
Guy:ArE Ya SeriousBRUThER
I knew it You can’t see the ghost kitchens cockroaches 🪳 or any human hair
Mr beast here is 1,000000$ food theory here is 0$
*Mr Scott Cawthon I have an idea for you...*
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
This is fake
I may be late to this video but its super interesting.
My goth this is crazy HES BROKE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Why am I only finding this video after I already learnt about ghost kitchens???
No he made it free and you said you got your burger when his place was new
Just wanna say the MrBeast Burger coming out of Beaverton OR is absolutely fire. Probably one of the top 10 burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of burgers
I hate that I laughed at the beginning. But that’s just a theory a me theor- fool. It tis not a theory, for it tis a fact.
Bukedebebo
so basically those artist helps people to have or stay to their job during this  pandemic  helping  people while earning win win situation
The title be like: Mrbeast burgers isn't real it can't hurt you. Mrbeast burgers:
Ok
I can imagine matpat owning his own restaurant matpats theory bites
Oooookay... Not to be "that" guy, but what about front-of-house staff? Waiters, expediters, hosts? Yes this wonderful for kitchen staff, but this completely eliminates the front half! 😫
Bruh it’s not in Houston.... I ordered 1 and it said you order has been canceled I was angry
You better go get a piece Burger or else Mr B's not going to give you money
I just ordered Mr Beast burger while working to give it a try just because of this video! I’m glad I was able to hear about this!
I haven’t even watched this video but I know that this is going to be Matt Pat shaming our favourite restaurant Mr. beast burgers
Bruh u smart
I already knew this when i first tried to order beast burger
I ordered a   burger so its true
Good video! I figured this out one day when I noticed there were a bunch of MR. Beast locations in my area according to a food app. But there were no Mr. beast locations in my area. So I went down a rabbit  hole figuring out what was going on.🤣
That’s really smart
at least it's still better then McDonald
you are fake
Great food theory
Soon we wont need to walk to fast food because we will be the fast food
Matpat wants a fnaf restaurant too XD
The only problem with this is that restaurants are taking advantage of this and doing a half-a** job with Beast Burgers, giving the Beast Burgers a bad reputation despite the fact that it’s not their fault, it’s the restaurant’s fault.
These look great bro
Who ever said fast food restaurants had real food 🗿
Mr.Beast is the real life Mr.Gatsby... at least how Gatsby in the book through extravagant parties for any and everyone
We all now your lying his burgers taste good
Actually one of the best burgers I've ever had
I can't have any of their food due to being in the UK. Sorry mr beast. Also great episode. Very fun to watch.
what do you mean ''what a was of money'' the beast burgers are free
i want a pauly d sandwich
Sadly, this says something about the quality of the food. Normally in a ‘real’ restaurant the chef has knowledge of the product and the type of kitchen. These foods are basically all fast foods and the process is dumbed down so everyone can make it. A lot of processed food which only needs to be heated up or assembled.  I was silently hoping the covid crisis would give a boost to homecooking with fresh produce, but the opposite is sadly true.
Mr Beast and Guy Ferrari are ghosting out of  Bartuccis near me.
This  actually not a new concept this is how most chains got started. The down side is your  not making  little  to no money on your  original food and you switch to the new stuff that everyone  is buying.
I don’t liky them burgers
Ok I mean I love the food, but 50 for three meals was a bit excessive
I went on a trip to Reno, Nevada. The restaurant there did a really good job in my opinion.
So hes earning money and helping other busineses not to bankrupt at the same time.
Buca de beppo doesn't sound real
haah
The Las Vegas one is in a Brio Italian Grille I was so confused 😂
Someday you won’t be able to buy food without a smartphone.
It is a good idea, but it will significantly eat (pun intended) into dining market share. Waitresses, hostesses, cleaning staff etc will be left unemployed. The restaurant sector will benefit tremendously but the service sector will be left behind just the same as the pandemic did to them. At least it solves half of the problem though :)
The one in El Paso Texas is straight out of a breaking bad scene

Nah dude. Nothing is wrong

Mr. Beast is the Mansa Musa of our generation.
Me beast burger is real
I hope the next channel is Book Theory
I already knew that though.
Sus
It is a real restaurant idiot
We were so excited to try Mr. Beast Burger and our experience was terrible. 😔 The burgers were nothing like what's advertised, the fries were seasoned but tasteless (not sure how that is even possible). The "best" item we git for our $23 meal was the grilled cheese sandwich. It still wasn't great but better than the burger and chicken sandwich (which neither had the toppings that are on normal sandwiches or were an add on online.) Nothing came wrapped in Mr.Beast Burger wrappings or even with a sticker on a lousy brown bag. My son absolutely loves this channel but we were extremely disappointed in our experience with Mr. Beast Burger. I'd do a check on quality control at one of your Dallas "kitchens" if I were you. That location does not represent you well.
I got a chris style burger with fries for my first order! It was delicious!!!!!!
Buca di Beppo is a real restaurant
Mr.Burger, like how come noone thought of this
Even in food theory fnaf still takes over
Me Beast big brain
now im doing it.
Hay guys can I ask how can I make my videos better and no I am not a stupid bot
I always wondered what the bottom two lights would be lol
"Give me rent!"
I Live in alaska 😑 I can’t have a burger
Lol he's roasting mr beast and still hearts his comment   Btw food Theorists  your vid sucked Mr beast is better🙂
Mr beast burger is real
Wow matt tryna get rid of the competition
This could save a lot of restaurants here on Brazil. A handful of restaurants permanently closed during the pandemic. Having this model around here would be a gamechanger!
you are not real
In n Out isnt even trying to expand lmao
Knowing the right people with the right money anything can happen.  Even world domination  :)
my local beast burgers says delivery only
How is it a waist of money if it's free
HMMmMMmmMmm at the beginning you said that it was bad
Well I tried to order. It didn't go thru. I tried a bunch of times. Even called the ghost kitchen. They denied my "Dream" burger order. They asked me to order from their menu. I said no
game theo and food theo wut
What will happen when everything is back to normal what’s going to happen to these businesses
MrBeast is really good don’t judge him 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡!!!!
I think this video was the most advertising Bucca de Beppos has ever had.
Its real
Mrbeast am so sad i dont have food :<
I hate him
Yes mrbeast the transphobic dude
Very bullish on uber eats, doordash, postmates etc...
gonna find one way or another to start a virtual restaurant that only sells pretty patties
4:19 I don't think it's a win for the employees that are still getting paid the minimum wage
Are you serious brother
Wow I had no idea about all of this and it goes through Brio near me that’s so crazy haha
Don't u dare talk to mrbeast like that or else...
I guess I need to know what a Mr. Beast is to get this food theory. Thanks anyway MatPat.
How do I start ?  Ghost kitchen to start a business ?
*Stonks*
Why do you sound like an angry virgin?
You posted after him after he made it or....
If you go there won't they notice you? Matt
I did this the first time I ordered I wanted to see the location so I looked it up only to find out it was a different restaurant
What happens when Covid goes away?There chefs will be busy so won’t be able to make other restaurants food.
So basically just said if you want A successful restaurant which goes around the entire country you need to make the best and the most charitable channels and you’ll open about 367 restaurants in a day that’s how you do it
If you look at it ghost kitchens can actually sell way more then they need because instead on making the place smaller you could replace dinning with kitchen meaning more faster cooking more food produced more money and more people joining the online cooking group because you could have the space to also sell their stuff meaning they could then sky rocket in number of places to buy food they would have because they would have more money than they would ever need.
DAYHMMNNNNN THIS MAKES SENSE
Mr beast burger is so filling I eat half and full 😂👌👀
Its horrible
Its just a way for mr beast to make more money from his brand
I think you should open your own restaurant
He is trying to make YouTuber a go down
Me east this person is lying
The restuarant isn't real because he said he rented it
I'm in Indonesia
cllick bated -_-
Mr Beast is actualy a mutated clone of Mr Krabs.
Why does this matter its food you eat it
I learned a lot about Mr beast burgers like alot
This is the first time I’ve heard of a ghost kitchen
So a crazy guy like this is in the world we live in lol
Its just wingz is fucking awesome and comes out of chili’s. Their fries and Oreos are not available at chili’s but the wings are the same.
Wouldn’t a BeastBurger taste like Cotton, since dollars are made with cotton?
Americans:Eats burgers for almost everyday Asians:👁👄👁
Your just poor
Bruh its real 🤑💰
3 minutes intro
Fun fact there is a beast burger in Canada!
When a video has something to do with mr beast and it ends at 11:11 you know its good
The Mr. Beast Burger ghost kitchen for my town is made through a Highway 55
I rrally need an ipad im so jealous of people that got them in this restaurant
theres not one in my state but there's one in alaska
thats a lie mrbeast started with 300 beast burger restuarants because he was building them all at the same time so he didnt have to build a bunch of other beast burger restuarants letar on
These restaurants are a rip off there should be a option for pick up
we are waiting for the five nights at matty's
4:30 YOOOOOO DOUBLE SUN GLASSES
Matpat eat burney
Matpat:what a waste of money Mr beast:trigged
2:03 **sad alaskan noises**
matpat:we cant go  to restraunts anymore  me:who lives in small country in the smallest city in the country also me:you may not be able to go to restraunts but i sure can
Tastes amazing. Love the Chris style!   Got MrBeast and Chris cup too!👍🏼❤
* low voice * no i want phone nooooooo
That's  a great vid
bruh mrbeast is a charity youtuber u are so wrong
It’s not fake
ITS ON GOOGLE MAPS XD THERES ONE A FEW HOURS AWAY FROM LAKE MICHIGAN IN CHICAGO OMGGGGG
I'm glad I didn't drive 45 minutes to a place that doesn't even technically exist. Prolly why its had so many 1 star reviews, cuz it comes from some random "restaurant" that doesn't seem to care.
:)
I’m not gunna watch the video but I bet he is going to say that mrbeast burger is just Burger King
how about we forget this and make our own food
This is the start to the MrBeast Mafia family.
I want to go there
I am waiting for Food Theory theoretical kitchen to open up across the country...
One of the coolest things I’ve seen so far
Shadow kitchens explained in 11 minutes
Totally explains why I cant find it on maps.
Ddddddddddduuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmm
ummmm
I don’t understand take out because by the time you get home it’s luke warm and soggy???? Then I have to microwave it and I mine as well of bought frozen food for half the cost. Sorry COVID I’m gonna continue going in and sitting down to eat Lmfaoooo
srsly man doing this to my favorite youtuber?
I wish i can but its not in my country
Hey I’m in Pennsylvania :)
Fun fact: Matpat has more money than mr beast
Jimmy is living nice with those tax deductible donations
5:50 EY Pittsburghers represent!
Mr Beast is a fucking genius
When I clicked on this I was worried that it would be something like "Mr. Beast is selling dog burgers" or something like that, but then as I watched it I realized I had been watching to much gaming and film theories. lol
Don’t think this will be the new norm, delivery food cost more so there’s will always be walk in restaurants
OOOOOOOO MRBEAST CAUGHT YOU MAKING THIS VIDEO GO ORDER SOMG BEAST BURGER LIKE HE SAID B U R G E R S 🍔🍔🍔
are you kidding??? i was 15 min over to the mr beast place and i missed it, dang. oh well
Is there a mrbeast burger in the Philippines?
It is like a cloud kitchen.
It is real and edible
This channel is fake and not what you think
So i was looking for a mr.beast burger on google maps and the closest to me was a buca di beppo😅
You act as if people actually like delivery food. Why would I order for delivery and risk cold food when I could drive there AND not support predatory apps
Mr.beast: He knows too much take him out  Mr.Beasts Hitman: He will be dealt with
Yeah, this is all good but if you look at the replys to the tweet announcing everything you'll find that *the food isn't good and the chicken is RAW*
Reminds me of Chromatica Oreos. I know I won't like it, but I need it
Who else is here when the Dream Burger released
At first we didn't know what to do with all the money.  We tried shredding it, burying it, and burning it.  But in the end we decided to just give it all away.
Me tries to buy: mom get me beast burger  Mom: is 18 dollar, we can’t buy, it’s to expensive Me: ....... :(
6:29 MatPat gonna have to change 50 mil to 60 mil
Bucidepepo
Lol I actually work on the AC and refrigeration systems on Brio Grill in Southlake lol
I'm a beast burger and I approve this message
DONT TALK ABOUT MRBEAST BURGER LIKE THAT
I wish they had it in canada
Mrbeast is the best he’s a good
BRUH
I hate you!
he probably uses the spare bank vault he now has to store all of his money
Ahem they don't give you napkins
B burger is just ads mr beast is a well known name people order because hes famous
Girst
I only eat McDonald’s for nostalgia
This is honestly a genius idea kudos to mr beast and his team coming up with this
food is life
Him saying Bucca Di Beppo made my day
The closest one to me is an hour and a half away so no
Wow i want to go there to be a millonarie 😎
you make it sound like its a bad thing that people  are having "ghost kitchen"
Sounds like fiverr for food!
Fake person don't talk like that about jimmy
"What a waste of money" You already got your money back
Fr here's a story: my brother wanted mr beast burger so we ‘went there’ but there was nothing it was horrible 👹
#grubthory
2:59 Soviet Union wants to know your location.
And now mrbeast you ruin his challeges
And why do you care
You ruin all resturants
How can you control quality and protect your brand if there are differences in how “Mr.Beast Burgers” are prepared.?
“Congrats you just earned 700 for ordering a mrbeast burger”
Mr Beast just feels like an irl modder in GTA Online that is just bored and does random money drops
This is absolutely brilliant, I’m so proud of this country. Now where’s my phone, imma order Popeyes
I mean that’s what you think
I can’t get grub hub where I live😅
😭thars no MrBeast Burger in my city i live in oregon and thars one in portlend but i dont live were any of MrBeast Burger can be delverd
I have never hade a beast. Burger
Wow, gotta love Mr. Beast. Helped come up with probably the best idea I've heard so far to save the dying restaurant chains.  Heck, I gotta say that this is the future of restaurants right here.  At least what I want it to be.  Cut down on all the redundant kitchens and just have a few massive ones in each area.  Each of them gets to cook dozens of menus.
Oh no mr beast better not take down in and out please don’t
Guys if u door dash just ask the driver where he picked it up at lol
Every comment by MrBeast gets pinned
Your the fake one this is clickbait not mrbeast this guy
I like mrbeast but I think the restraint is kinda suspicious
God Jimmy is smart
Nightmare chica killed me 🤣
This is genius, if MrBeast chose a failing restaurant to make his burgers he could seriously help them out
thing is part of the thing you pay for is the experience
I hate mr beast so that is the only restaurant that I won’t go to
Is this a good or bad thing?
You should do music theory for your last channel and the color should be blue
How do you know?
I think its just all fake matpat
The intro song gives me Mario kart vibes
beast burger its a cult the took chandlers hair and karl hair
Does it exist in Australia?
Bogadebepo
Oh god grubhub
Have to admit Mr beast is a business genius
Fooooooooood
hmmmmmmm
Food theory tacos
I found one of the ghost kitchen, 2 hours away, for mrbeast, beaches they left out mrbeast burger wrapps
2:52 Money
Wot
I just realized how much of a blessing mr beast is like imagine I want to die with 0 dollars in my bank account what a blessing to this world
what do you mean what a waste of money? you earn money
Mmmmmmmmmmm
Same thing with Denny’s, I work there and we recently got this new thing called Burger Den, that in itself is a different brand from Denny’s, but the foods from that menu are being made from Denny’s itself. Which there is no problem with, so it really is a good strategy, except for the confused doordash people that always ask me if this is the right place to pick up food from Burger Den.
Sad you all get to eat beast burger . I live in India so can you expand your business worldwide?
Why am I so hungry!!!!!
Mat pat probably got so much hate for this
7:15 I’m pretty sure those “New” images were on New super mario bros for the wii.
727 when you see it
Jimmy is the best
This is what I do instead of school
How does he have so much money?!
bruuuuuuuuhh :O
Ngl Mr Beast is the smartest YouTuber in the world and YouTube platform
It’s kind of obvious will be using that money for good things
This sounds like laundering with extra steps.
how do you know what paper tastes like?
Culver’s watching the first three minutes like 👁👁👂🏻✋🏻
You cat say it's a waste of money it is free
This fake it real

Do  a food theory on FNAF pizza! (joke)
Never once talked about how food quality suffers @the whim of consistency, distributing and reheating frozen food (of which you the customer have no idea where or when it was made!) in a Ghosh kitchen of which you have no idea of the health and safety standards or the quality or care of the workers! This is why we like to go to a restaurant, cause liability and consistency is key to trust.
Jose kippw
Jeje
Ive worked several chain kitchens, there dirty and gross, 100% wouldn’t order a youtubers burger that i know for a fact came out of an Olive Garden down the road that got a 2 from the heath inspector
yes do it nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww ok
YOU ARE INSULTING MR BEAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As someone who runs a ghost kitchen for him AND I have to cook for my actual restaurant. It’s hard because it’s so frickin busy
Why does that man have so much money
"Freddy Fazbears Pizza & Wings", But it Just. Might. Work.
But whats wrong with doing that
Me gusta Mr beast
Why are you just a cardboard cut-out in your own video?
I love the burgers ok idc if anything is messed up with it it’s still the best burger ever
im wondering if karl fangirls sniff and licking  the sandwich thinking the touched it lmao
Mrbeast in 2080:destroying the moon an surprising nasa with a bigger one
Honestly, this feels less like a theory and more like an explanation of ghost kitchens and talking about virtual dining.
Ok
Does it deliver in Europe Denmark??? Anyone knows?
MrBeast be like:👁👄👁    And me:👁👄👁 wait what?
MrBeast:Memer,Billionaire,Great Person and a Great Youtuber
Okay let's buy mrbeast burger because my house is near with the one of mrbeast burger restaurant not too near but near I think as far as mrbeast burger from my house is 3 km
“What a waste of money”. It’s Free and he pays you to eat there
he’s so fucking smart
I was scrolling through Ubereats earlier and I found this restaurant I looked up the address and it said its in the mall and another one was red robin
matpat saying buca de beppo is so funny to me
Beast burger: our lore goes deeper than fnaf
Mrbeasts comment is under me so you listen to him and order his burger
10:34 same I would love to see fnaf come irl. :D
I love mr beast burger i just had and it is good

👌 video
8:57 give me rent
Great Idea. Gell got me 🤔of a new e endeavor
I must say, it's a brave new world. This is one great video, really explains a lot. Cheers
Worst service ever. It took two hours for them to get my order completely wrong. Customer service said it was nothing they could do. What we did receive was burnt and dry. Will never go back. Sorry but it’s over priced trash.
Its also at some pizza bones
lol mr beast comented
Wait buca di beppo is a chain the more you know I guess.
Yeah when I was younger I used to steal pieces of pizza off the trays of people when they left (hey free food right)
I want Mr beast burger but can I get it from another country
UK: What’s Mr Beast burger?
Yummy
We can all agree: everything MrBeast has given away makes us all have a beautiful day!
Just give me 30,000 dollars please. Because then I could leave the pyramid scheme urban America is and tell people the truth and save some souls.
Mrbeast Is real
Not related to the video, but yeah, someone should make a Fazbear Dinner, but make it like a restaurant/entertainment facility. Make it like the games, (creepy animatronics and run down looking building) instead of making it look like how a normal restaurant should.
Where I used to live    They didn’t deliver
Are we not going to talk a bout mattpatt just putting a video in revers 8:33
Make a food restaurant chain called MatPats theory
I just had one!🍟🍔
I went and got a beast burger and they were operating at a food truck
I’d love for something like this to happen in Britain! All the cool stuff is in America! 😭
What about youtube thieros
I cant try it because i live in england☹️☹️
First time I had it, it was good. Then they started making Foster's Freeze sell "their" version.
So you're saying is not real 300 place right ummm let me think because he got it a long time ago
This guy is a scam
LOVE  you.er vides
So good
Remember when he didn’t do crazy giveaways and it was reacting to terrible YouTube intros whilst making constant references to bleach?
I NEED TO TRY MRBEAST BURGER!!!
I live near a MR BEAST BURGER.
were is your beast burgers
You’ve probably seen the Mr.Beast picture multiple times.. but did you notice his sunglasses? (Time stamp: 10:31)
Theory food
4:29 did you just put sunglasses on a Mr beast picture that is already wearing sunglasses? WHY?
Mr beast said to do it soooo DO IT!!!
I bet 50% of the people that went only went to see Karl Jacobs (tbh I would too)
I really don't know if you help people from England but I am an Ex addict, I am registered disabled and I can't rent a place anywhere because they only take people who work, I don't have any who can sign for me, Is there anyway you could rent me a place. I would actually pay you. To do it.because I have the deposit just can't get anywhere
oi
He dint say gurbhub   I disliked and  unsubscribed
2:05 Alaska 😢
MrBeast is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

MatPat: What a waste of money  Me: Uhhh the restaurant is free and gives you money
Food
Idiot
Food
I hate you
Mr Beast is the only rich man I respect
He never gave away an island, he never purchased it to start with. Hes the biggest fraud on you tube
Rip Canadians
Game theory are the same as food theory
I hate MrBeast guy is so annoying and seems ridiculously egotistical
'girls and ghouls'   Weebs: R U N
My MrBeast Burger is in a pub that says "coming soon"
mrbeast is by far a superhuman his the real life version of superman if he was born a human

I'm sorry I don't believe this
Why are you bullying this man
Do book theory
I never had a Mr.beast burger but I want to try one
Uh in a few years Mr beast will have absolutely no money
Mrbeast said he  wanted to will give away all of his money  before he dies ☺️
#MrBeast#MrBeastBurger#FastFood
He. Is just a hater
The beast is starting the era
First day open free money
You've been stabbing people for money stop giving people money it's fake money
I thought mrbeast just didn't have locations of mrbeast burger but I guess he does and that's cool what he did
Bruh, I didn't know MrBeast owned a restaurant. I would love to eat there.

Im really sad because theres no mr beast's burger in Poland 😓😓😓😓
Lol bruh

Love ya vids but here’s a tip mrbeast is very popular so before you say something bad about a popular person think 💭 many people will be mad 😡 properly ;P
U can’t get Mr Beast Burger in the UK
I'm just hungry
mr beast i love your vides!!!
Mat: this burger is a waist of money.. Mr beast: the burger is money... 9999999999999 years later Mat:wait.. it's all money? Mr beast: always has been 🔫 Mat: oh it was all virtual Mr beast: always has been
gotta have fnaf in here somehow lol 3:14
Could this be our future of food along with the taco bell take away restaurant?
@Mr Beast just make a deal with mcdonalds and your restaurant will be easily international (or any other international food companies)
Him: Look up mr. beast burger now! Me: okay. It will not deliver to my house because it doesn't deliver in Hercules, California. Please add it!
And every delivery driver is screwed over.
MrBeast is the God of Money..
Mr beast  has a real restaurant  someone got one
Huh
I live near in and out
What a waste of money!?  You just ate money
Mr beast burger is good and u know it, I may not watch mrbeast but I know what quality is.
BUT WHAT ABOUT PICK UP
You are just making people food like garbage and making people out of businese  you are just a jerk
Imagine working for a mr beast burger...
在
6:42 anyone else notice he like the letter b
The plucky path cephalometrically chop because gun relatively fail per a abiding pail. squalid, heartbreaking dancer

Lol
This is a joke so don't take it seriously.    UGHHHH DO YOU HAVE TO RUIN EVERYTHING THAT IS GOOD DO SECRETS  OMAGOD.    this is a joke love all the channels.
We'd love to see a food theory (or film) on what it would cost to feed scooby doo and shaggy based on how they eat. Think it'd be really interesting, so wanted to pass it along-thanks!
ey odd1sout was it ???
I hate you
I live in Wisconsin. Never heard of any of these restaurants
Mrbeast is awesome
Mrbeast is awesome
i think its fake dude me look like this guy looks like hater or a faker
mrbeast sell free food right
I like that idea
Mr.beast is the best YouTube person ever i jave subed
Its mr burger everbody
There’s something else these things all have in common- they’re incredibly easy/fast to make (burgers, fries, wings, cookies,subs) and hard to screw up ... I assume for consistency the cookie dough is premade and shipped to the restaurants 🤷🏼‍♀️
All I could think of when he showed the map of the mrbeast burger places across the us was Poor Alaska, they don't get one
Why you diss Mr beast?
watch in 1.5x thank me later!
Some resturant are not preparing MrBeast burgers to its best
🔥
The new Richie rich
I hope when Covid-19 is gone we can actually go to the restaurant
Your a hater!!!!!
Wait HE WAS IN TEXAS AND NO ONE TOLD ME?!
This is possibly the most low effort cash grab "Mr Beast" has ever tried. There is no doubt in my mind that once all the youtubers have "reviewed" this food that the restaurant will disappear. Mr Beast is a fraud and I will wait patiently until he slips up and gets prosecuted for something.
Big brain burger, gives me big hunger
petition for matpat pasta
4:31 did you just give jimmy 2 glasses because he already has glasses on
Not me waiting for Food Theory to make a restaurant, you can get a 'Theory Meal' which comes with a notebook and a question/topic.
Hey my pet can you tell Mr. Reese to use all the money that he owed to buy a cool slow Mo camera because he has no slow motion things and make it and it’s really easy you could slow down the footage
Hey you want Italian? Sure Ok let me find somewhere. (Checks address for 8 different company’s, then googles that address) Hey I found a place.
Ngl I had high hopes of the food was mediocre
I would not call a scammer a "celebrity"
Stop lying mrbeast burger is yummy they said in their i opened the first free restauranst
Game theory or this
DABABY
This isn’t a theory it’s a well known fact
So you have Mr delivery in America, in South Africas main 3rd party delivery services are Mr delivery and Uber eats
Why
Also, if you're looking for international audience, I have a place in Bangladesh that I'd gladly give you guys to open up a restaurant here!!! ✌🏻
Ha! I looked up Mr Beast Burger in DoorDash to see if there was one near me and they're operating out of my favorite local burger joint!
Anything from MrBeast is NO WHERE NEAR FAKE. cmon, why would you accuse the most generous person in the whole world
Food theory restaurant???
all these small restaurants went out of business and the megacorps got busy trying to figure out how to disguise their olive garden as local family joints
there is no way one kitchen can handle four different menus with any pretense of quality
I 100% thought buca de beppo was made up gibberish.
I love no sponsored videos
Mr. Beast needs to build a real life Freddy Fazbear's Pizza
"Five Nights At Freddy's 'Sister Brand'" * sister location alarm goes off *
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😡😡🤬🤬
Imagine how much more money mr beast will give away with this chain. This guy already gives away 10000$,islands,cars,stores...off the money of YouTube and SHOP MR BEAST.COM.Now this guy owns a chain that could possibly become the biggest chain in the world.Surpassing big names like McDonald’s and In an Out.He also plans to expand even more,burgers look good and starting to get advise on improving the quality from cooking channels like Googa Foods.This guys budget gonna sky rocket.Next vid might as well be buying NASA.Or trying to run fore president idk.This guys standard now is probably 100k.Not to mention this will bring even more subs in.This guy has less subs then others like T series but gets more views and has more influence,he is the number one reason Pewdiepie got so close to beating T series in the first place,this guy has best fan base of all time and a reputation for being the nicest man on YouTube and maybe the world.In any case I’m excited for this to reach Canada,will be waiting Mr Beast,Congratulations 🥳
8:50 Did that building just master Ultra Instinct
Theres a mr beast burger restaurant 3 miles from my house😅
Love the video new sub btw
Shut
What do you mean you wasted alot of money ?? There free burgers
Amm good◇◇◇
Ik lol
No that is real
If Mr. beast came to my company not saying I have one I would just say you could have it and my employees can work for you lol
i pefer dine-in though
Why do you do this all the time you make evrey thing so boring omg
You link everything to fnaf mat-
MAKE FNAF REAL
The only problem I see with stuff like this is if something happens with the food and someone gets sick from eating it or even dies by a simple mistake of cooking it in something they are allergic to then the blame falls on him even though it would be someone else's fault so from a legal standpoint how does that work
MrBeast pizza or MrBeast tacos
Omg I love mr.beast he literally gives away money and it is so nice and it could really help someone because you will never know what someone is going through or what someone will go through.
”What a waste of money” b-but i tought they were free
Also the part when he says in and out has over 300 locations  in the US that took them years to achieve, he should have used a different fast food place because as of right now only 7 states in the US have in and out locations. No hate just saying
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001☆
Mknlpoi

Plz open ur reastrunt in ksa
Me living 10 minutes away from a Buca di Beppo: *Can we eat at Buca di Beppo tonight?*
Thats not real mrbeast Burger is the best
The restaurant I work at is literally a Ghost Kitchen and I still learned more in this video than what they told us hahaha
Opp i meant to say... FOOD THEORY IS WRONG MRBEAST BURGER IS A REAL PLACE I'M PUTTING A THUMBS DOWN!!!👎👎👎
Bruh it is real bruh you didint understand it so many people delivered mr beast burger in online its ok theres no money its ok to me and that was real not fake dude watch the mr beast burger to understand it ok
Food theory is a real place I'm putting a thumbs down 👎
MrBeast is doing a really great thing with this the way you explained it. He's keeping up jobs for restaurants that could have failed during quarantine, he's keeping deliveries up for the people (although I wouldn't say he's making those jobs because people would order out anyway), and he's giving an extra option for people ate home. Also, I'm guessing he's not gonna hold onto the money for too long before investing into more jobs or giving it away to random people. This is a good example of capitalism working well for many parties.
Is this a global thing or a US thing??
First time watching your video. Along with all the helpful info, Love love love your voice and enthusiasm. Subscribed!!!!
Brilliant!
I’m watching this two months later because   1. I had no idea mr. beast had a burger joint until now and  2. I just had a beast burger for dinner today because my mom ordered some
So they're basically dropshipping food lol
They charge for mayo ketchup and mustard packets 🤣 Also cold after waiting 2 hours
So maybe they should tell the drivers this because my driver canceled my order because he couldn’t find “the mr beast burger building” ....
Epic Intro
reported!!!
One of my kids asked me for food from there today. We are out of delivery range though. I will be on the lookout for more locations in the future though. :)
???
Omg do you actually think mrbeast cooks all the burgers u must be dumb off he hires people to cooked for him
Stop mrbeast burger is real

Matpat: Fnaf Sister brand does have a nice ring to it  Sister location: am i a joke to you?

Hey dude! I loved the vid so much. I have been trying to find for a vid like yours that really breaks down the stuff in this video! 👍 🧑‍⚕️ The part at 1:21 is super educational. Your video really is like the videos from this new health enthusiast Dr Ethan! Ethan's demonstrations are actually informative and he helped me on my diet! He is an insightful med student on YouTube and he explains mental health.  I suggest you watch his YT out and give the medical student a subscribe here! ➡️ #DrEthanEducation
Dont be dising my homie
It is a interesting concept for a restaurant. Maybe it could be the next big thing?
Food Theorist! Expose Ronald McDonald! I will not stop commenting until you do!
Imagine Papaburgers
Those who Hate His Restaurant   You're Too Sensitive
You guys are crazy.
Was really confused when I went online and it said delivery online. Just hoping the one "near" me isn't actually made by Buca di Beppo, they're gross. EDIT: NOOOOOOOO! I just looked it up! Mine is either right next to Buca, or it IS Buca.
8:58 I can just hear his voice ... “RENT?!”

Could have done this in a neighborhood that had more need. Southlake is one of the wealthiest communities in this area...
He’s laundering his money
"Food theory"  Everything said was literal facts
If Smashburger and it's parent do this my investment will be happy
Im curious of this theory with restaurant concepts like Kitchen United Mix. We have one in Austin but the concept is a slew of restaurants exist in one building for pickup and delivery only. It’s another great concept that I hope also picks up in popularity. There’s currently only 5 locations nationwide, but I feel it too is on this new trend of virtual restaurants.
Mr beast i want 100.000€ pls plssss i live on Latvijā and the city is Rīga :) plssssssss

avocados from mexico
You know there's like over a few dozen places that do this now.  Mr beast isn't the first.
The In n Out and MrBeast Burger location count comparison is impressive but very much highlights the importance of “quality over quantity.”
Not only is Jimmy a BEAST, buts he's a flippin' GENIOUS!. See what i did there? Flippin' get it? flippin a burger... Beast burger...
food theory is not real  not what you think.
Is this video a joke
i hate peaple like this destroy peaples bussness arg
That’s sorta how my favorite restaurant in my city started. If anyone here happens to be in/near Louisville, Kentucky, that’s how New Wave Burritos started. They were a weekend delivery-only service operating out of a German-style restaurant kitchen after hours, and after having enough success, moved into a bar, and then eventually got their own building. They’ve since opened a sister bar/restaurant in town that’s awesome, too!
I don’t think your right sir bc I tried it and it was. Actully kinda good
I saw a youtuber eat a meal from there once and the food was literal trash-
The Fnaf reference was great
you should open up freddys pizza!
What do you mean its real
MrBeast gives someone 1,000,000  Tax are you forgetting someone😈😈😈😈😈😈
I would love to have a burger there
I just got a YouTube Channel
Where do you live
Low key I honesty don’t like ordering from Virtual restaurant (I have worked on postmates) to be honest your food kinda set there for a long time due to high volume they have and other places move the food to a hub where you drivers go and pick from it makes the process more complicated then it should and again your food is just sitting there getting cold . The other reason I don’t like it is more we see these ghost restaurants pop up the less creative the food gets and become bland and uniform something I seen happen a lot living in a big city like Los Angeles when ordering food sometime it feels like 10-15 percent of the restaurant I can order from are really just the same thing with a different logo also word of advice they might offer the same burger or item but it doesn’t mean they are priced the same I have come across place where I can buy an item for like 10 bucks and another place say item uses the same stock fucking photo for 15 so yeah I really dislike this trend don’t see any real benefits for the consumer at all
About places closing because of the pandemic, I'm somewhat happy to say only one place closed down near me (two if you include the restaurant that burned down), but what closed down was my local theater.
https://youtu.be/6PkyNYIjDQ8
I’m Canadian and I straight up thought be made up the name Buca di Beppo. Sounds made up and we don’t have any here
yourjust rude
I want one in germany
Mr beast burger is quantity over quality
Step out of your bubble, a majority of the USA never shutdown. Paying delivery charges on food will get old quick. Texas and Florida for example.
Am i the only one watching this wondering "Who tf is mr beast"?
4:50 Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no. (ITS GRUBHUB)
Wow!
Oddly enough i've gotten food from both Mariah's Cookies and Mr. Beast Burger mentioned in this video!! It's located near the waterfront in pittsburgh lmao
do you have a kids meal mr beast i see mrbeast is on commets
sorry I don't think Mr beast burger restaurant reach here in Philippines
As someone who's worked in kitchens, the issue I see with this is that multiple menus means lower quality. The more unrelated dishes your cooks need to prepare, the worse each dish is going to be. This is why incredibly expensive restaurants normally have fairly restrictive menus by comparison to fast food places. When there's a coherent and relatively small menu, the staff is able to make each dish at a level of quality the customer wouldn't be able to reproduce at home.   If multiple unrelated restaurants are operating out of one kitchen, but the number of workers doesn't increase to match that, then every single restaurant's food is going to take a hit in terms of the quality. This also creates a risk of overwork or understaffing, which can lead to things like employee burnout, workplace injuries, or even things like food poisoning.
Don't hate on m beast pls I liked and subscribe and turn notifications on but it don't matter how it taste it about how many love you put it in but I love your videos and I watch mr beast and I subscribe to mr beast guy don't forget to subscribe to mr beast and turn notifications on on to mr beast

I’ve had it, and it was really good.
Well than y does it pop on googlemaps???!!!
Am Canadian
Didn’t know Buca di Beppo was a real name at first. Sounded like what Peter Griffin would say trying to speak Italian.
You know, the fact that Scott hasn't hopped on this yet is such a missed opportunity. Come on Scott! Give us Fazbear's Pizza!

Still waiting for them to come to Colorado Springs,  Colorado
Because mrbeast is rich and kind
mrbeast burger is real because i ordered it over 10 times! order now! this video is fake!
The vsuace music too
3:08 is that a Tokyo ghoul reference, “well, hold on guys and ghouls.”
Big brain time: Why pay rent when you can operate your ghost kitchen out of a caravan or food truck?
Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to the US as this stupid covid blocked the boarders of every single country making me trapped in my desolate house which made me give up on the idea of going to the US for now.
YooHoo Burger
HOLY CRAP i live in southlake tx i live right next to southlake townsquare where brios is
Hey there’s a mrbeast location in Alaska my guy
It isnt true! Mr Beast has helped many people
Given my own experiences with multiple delivery services and ghost kitchens, I really hope this trend doesn’t take hold and will fight it at every turn until the bitter end. Please support your local quality food restaurants when you don’t otherwise cook for yourself, which is always healthier and financially better.
Love the beginning
Why did the chicken cross the road        To get to tiger Bites
never liked mr beast anyway lol
The mr. Beast Burger near me is literally a Buca di Beppo.
me in living in canada watching this video left out and sad lol
Four words: "Rapidly configurable assembly lines."
Bad for kitchen staff, lack of oversight on quality, no consistency, anyone who would buy food from a celebrity is a sucker
so like ghost writers, but ghost chefs and ghost kitchens
Him:what a waste of money the burger: I’m priced at negative
You are just jealous
Yes, but did you know that Grubhub gives you perks on the food you love-?
A Ghost Kitchen is just like a Ghost Author It makes perfect sense!
so rude this channel is salty because they can make a restaurant
Freddie's pizzeria: our pizza contains zero* souls of the damned and comes animatronic free**!  *well, we grantee it's less than 0.5 souls per pizza **As in if it comes with animatronics, you won't be charged for them and we will pay you to cover up the incident that results
Buca di beppo
What do you expect there are free food
Fun fact he copied this of Niko Omilana
Uh oh😬
I love how on every part of the theory channels matpat always mentions fnaf in some way
Mr. Beast: Here's a million dollars. Everybody gets rich! ...... Economics: Am I a joke to you?
food theorists be like infinity iq
Hi
Mr beast opening fast food in the US  Everywhere else:fomo
You  lied
well basically its "*FOOD MERCH*"
❤❤
9:55 Fnaf Sister Location
The moral of the story is:  The Italians are REALLY good at rebranding.
The bertuccis at this mall by me has all but Pauly Ds
Lie it was free food you said A waste of money lie
Yes it is because people like it and faze rug tried it they like it and there was  sooooo menu people like it and they gave them money because they can pay there bills now if bu agree with me
Mayonnaise
Plot twist: He only made this video because all he wanted was a comment from mr beast to get famous!!
4:30 Mr Beast is wearing 2 sun glasses
i dont know why but it makes me happy that matpat knows what grubhub is
matpat: **talks about food delivery apps** me: **cries in rural nebraska**
I need to move now
Wow this guy knows a lot that perfesinals made yuck its o bad -.- because i tried them. That’s literally that guy he complains about every thing like a Caren
I ordered some and it didnt come with the cool bag or stickers on the food. And the food is average but still tastey.
Great vid
“Gave away”
Boss : "How can we make burgers better One guy : add extra onions Other guy : add extra cheese Mr beast : now hear me out ....10,000 with each burger
Grubhub perks gives you deals on the food you love
Yes are you sub to beast ?????????????
These are real
buca di beppo was a bad example, they are all still trying to make that long meatball
It defeats the purpose of fast food. You are suppose to be able to get food quickly well on a road trip
I hope they expand mrbeast burger into other country's
when i saw jersy shore for the first time i was wondering how is it at all popular and why is it still on the air then i wanted to kermit toaster bath just to make sure i never see it again
Fanf sister brand doesn’t sound bad what about sister location and it’s an actual game lol

Stop being a hater mr beast is the best he is number 1
Fake
Fack

Ghost Kitchen should give some of these companies the ability to have their menu available overseas, like the UK or Australia
*wants to buy Mr beast Burger* *Realizes I'm far away from America* *Me cri*
You say not good i you don mrbeast i whon you sorry mrbeast now
I had it not to long ago not bad at all
It's dropshipping but for food
Thanks for the IRL fazbear entertainment idea
I like the pun at the beginning
The one in Tennessee taste amazing bought the beast style and it was greattttt
This answered all my question. Is it really any good though?
Is it just me or is Matt saying Buca di Beppo satisfying?
Hey i think you’re right cuz the people in the mr beast food video didn’t even order you miss one detail and that’s that
Mc Donald's : we have the best fast food with affordable price Mr beast : hold my beer
Don't make mr.beast look bad😡😡😡😡😡🤬
So basically its a bodega delivery
you can’t say his burger sucks when he’s the smartest man on youtube
Burger please and money please and airport please
Im here bc of the Quang Tran video review. He kept calling it a ghost kitchen and I had no idea what he was talking about. But now I do.
Its not a waste of money, it gives u money
sucks when in area without even grub hub or door dash delivery
No way it is in Bangladesh 🇧🇩
We Need More Rick and Morty!!!
Money speaks I'll be on mister beast level as soon as I get hired
dislikers are mr beast stans that only read the thumnail
Lier😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Jimster Is here
*dislikes*
I don’t think I’d want to try the Beast a burger honestly, because it’s going to be prepared, and taste different at each and every single other location. A different existing restaurant would be making “the same” food but it would look, taste, and just be different in each location and city: State
It reminds me of a “Mondo Burger”..... if you mess with Mr.Beast you “End up in the grinder!!!” hahaha..... thanks good burger!
Why 🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔  Mr.Beast
I live in the center of WV, none of the gig/delivery services will even touch us out here.  Too poor and not crowded enough to make millions i guess  😔   Tho since there is no real public transport i think uber would work here.
Bruh he said it in the vid only deliverey and he didn’t build a restaurant
What if I was eating at a Buca de Bepo and said, "Can I have a Mr Beast burger?" (Maybe they would say no, then I'd just have to order from the app? LOL.)
Hello, don't mind me
MrBeast is a hero.
accidentally ordered from this place because im a boomer and didnt know what it was. def over paid, def wasnt great. 1/10 would not recommend. not a meme.
I got a question, is cereal a soup?
has anyone noticed that the picture that matpat uses for jimmy his sunglasses aren't on right?
Question: what did mr beast do to get that much money?
I had a Chris Style yesterday, it was SO good
me: hey MatPat, how many fnaf references do you think you can put in the Food Theory channel? MatPat: Yes.
You know I ate one and it tasted sooo good
8:15 *mentions grubhub *flashbacks to grubhub ad
Love the intro man
I literally just had Mr.beast burger today 😂
when come around my part of town beast burger
What is ur obsession with bucca di beppo?
Indeed. The smartest man alive.
Mr. Beast: I'm gonna give money to random, people I'm gonna giiiiiivvvve till I'm broke and dead  I'm gonna give money to random, people I'm gonna giiiiiivvvve till I'm broke and dead
I HATE YOUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL
Order from mr beast or say GOODBYE
mr beast: makes a restaurant restaurant: get 300 "locations" in just 1 day  other fast food restaurants: (⊙_⊙;)
*GRUBHUB BETTER*
Me and my sis planing to do this in the future 10:35
Mr beast burger is not good. It's basically over priced fast food.
Will he need to make his money backe he gave a lot to the poor
I bet all the restaurant owners are mad how a youtuber opens his own restaurant with 300 other locations when it took them decades for the same amount
What’s crazy is he is actually using Buca di Beppo for his Georgia location
E
10:18 Why is the official MrBeast Burger menu spelling Karl's name wrong?
Mat is a genus
Mr Beast has a Huge Brain!!!
Man, I could've use this video on our capstone, too bad the thesis advisor requires us to use published materials.
WTF
this is neoliberal bs
MrBeast might actually become a billionaire as some would say, but he'll be fluctuating from billionaire to thousandairre from time to time.
You: *;_;* *The fish S.O tells you not to worry about:* *;3;*     *I just really wanted to write this for no reason >:(*

4:31 why does he need glasses if he has them?
8:14 GRUB WHAT YOU LOVE
I came here to dislike
it's brilliant
Mr Beast destroying the natural order of restaurants on launch day
I hate food Theories
Ok but don't be mean to mr beast OT he will not give u money
I Thought buta de beppo was fake lol
I wonder if the mr beast burger will come to Canada ;)  Edit: unless it’s fake, IT VERY MUCH IS
Watching this while eating a mrbeastburger
I dont like this delivery only thing going on. I have had horrible experiences with it. Food not arriving, people leaving my food on the floor outside instead of giving it to me, food arriving cold, wrong food, its terrible. Then when something goes wrong there is little I can do to fix the issue. I need to contact the delivery driver, contact the restaurant, contact the delivery service. There is something great about going to a place and having hot fresh food delivered to a table where you can eat it right away while hot. I really hope this comes back soon as this new way of doing things honestly sucks and has ruined 'going out to eat' for me. I have gotten better at home cooking but if there is every a day I don't feel like cooking I often dread the experience of any of the delivery apps. Its been a while since I've used any of these and I may not use one again for a while. If a place has their own delivery service at least then if something goes wrong its easier to fix the issue, but going through third parties and trying to solve an issue is a nightmare and not something I hope becomes the norm.
My dog is very ANGRY
Free shipping?
BOOO
grub hub
WTF I thought you just made up the name buca di beppo, but it's real! SERIOUSLY! WTF, LMFAO, OMG!
MrBeast makes it too easy. I feel like when MatPat makes a new channel he taps that topic.
Its real matt stonie ate it.
Can you say Buca di Beppo again please
This is just semantics with profit.
Bertucci’s ah yes mother ya I get something from Bertucci’s    Can someone tell me what Bertucci’s is
Theory Eats    Think about it
Do you think this would completely replace restaurants ?   Like our decendent will see restaurant in history media ?
The burgers sucked, my bacon was raw and the cheese fries are and absolute joke
This comment is sponsored by raid shadow legends  Ok now move along
Hmm. Rich people profiting off a pandemic that is closing family owned restaurants and delivery services that charge way to much while ripping off delivery drivers by taking their tips to offset their minimum wage pay and classifying the drivers as gig workers screwing with everyone that used to be classified as a gig worker by messing with things like benefits. NO THANK YOU!!! But that's just a theory.
oh SHUT UP he is a F*cking GOOD PERSON
FAKEEE BRUH
I looked up all of these places on Door Dash. Nothing pops up.
Imagine if Scott and MatPat ACTUALLY made those Fnaf Pizzerias like he said at the end of the video. They would have the Delivery Service (A Fnaf Special [Food] Delivery), the publicity (FNAF), and the locations (just rebrand a couple of Chuck E. Cheeses)!!
Matt gone all nuts NO WE DONT NEED MASS GENOCIDE OF CHULDREN THANK U MATT
I am in uk and I am drooling at the food from mr beast but I can’t get any food cause I am not in USA
Soooo matpat you want a real fnaf pizzeria you should go ask mr.beast he’s got a lot of money on his hands
Hehe Buca di beppo
I guess I'm now a manager of bada pi bapu
If afton just did this Elizabeth wouldn't have died
MatHub perks gives you theories on the franchises you love, the kind a deals that make you matty.
9:54 what do you think the sister location is
I just realized most of food theory videos  aren’t theories they are food news maybe could be a different part of food theory like the science on GT this could be a really good series and if you see this matpat it would be a really good idea
Need one in oklahoma
Mr. beast, Commented
Mrbeast sorta pointed this out in his mrbeast burger video
I’m sorry mr beast
Dont talk about me.beast like that he's the best youtuber
"Buka Da Beppo"
I had no idea this existed.
I was wondering why the nearest location was a Buca di Beppo
Plz Matt Matt do a  theory on the keys of hi5 studio I think it would be amazing
Envy ?
BRAVO IS SOOOO GOOD I USED TO GO THERE A LOT BUT THEN IT CLOSED NEAR ME
Wait a second guys      Is it really you... FOOL!!!
This is made with cinema 4D right?  ✌️. I have been doing kinda similar content and maybe you should check me out. I'm sure you'll find find a lot of cool info on this topic on my channel too.
This guy can make a carrot seem super evil
im pretty sure the whole “free” memo wad only for the grand opening
Good in theory. A nightmare to actually carry out.
Ha
I’m kinda tired of the theorist guy. I feel like he complains about everything
Even there is fnaf
Number 15, The Mr Beast burger.
Too bad it’s not available by me   *cries in Staten Island*
You judging about burgers is he like you hate Mr beast burger
(;
thumbnail: mr beast burger isn't real me: neither is markiplier
Haters gonna hate
I think this is fake even iff u have 2.2m subs but mr beast has 53m
if mrbeast restaurant will be replaced by MC donalds and kfc, i wouldnt be upset bc may be not full but half of his profit out of his business he will be making, will use it in donations and charity.
Ok
The future is now old man!
He was just once a random channel with low subs begging to get his $70 mouse back....and now he gives away millions like pennys
Liar flamingo got one
This only works when the restaurants contracted to make the food can meet the standards for the "brand" and its customers. I think this is a brilliant idea to keep restaurants busy during this time, until restrictions are loosened and they can get back to their normal fare and operation. However I'm already seeing some scattered reviews on both sides of the spectrum - "...inedible fries...soggy, cold buns...missing items...communication poor" as well as "...worth the price...tasty...burgers and fries were great...". So clearly, for this (I assume) temporary brand to be profitable for the participating businesses, there are improvements to be made - namely in consistency of preparation (and therefore flavor) and streamlining the ordering experience.
Mr beast is a msart bussniness man
Wendys be like - ayyee that's illegal.
Gimme some burgers..😆
With the beginning of this video, I was like "What the heck!? How did I miss this?!?"  Then I realized in embarrassment "oh. It's cuz I'm not subscribed to Mr. Beasts channel"  Might be a good time to change that. Cuz I wanna see more of this ridiculous and awesome stuff XD
I hope i can buy one but iam on Philippines so i cant buy one
How bout this theory, its all just Cisco. Wait Sysco? No Cisco. Sysco!
Mr beast burger the best
But why would a kitchen want to serve food that they don’t know if it could get someone sick? If there’s a problem with the food the kitchen is the one that gets sued even if it’s a problem with e-coli in the beef or something, who will the victim go after in a lawsuit? The kitchen bucco de beppo which is a very profitable franchise or mr.beast who’s just one guy?
Cant wait to see Adele taco
Mr beast is the smartest dude in the world he is the beast  he is the leader  go mr beast  #mrbeast
He didn’t create the first free restaurant! Homeless shelters give free food
We can say 'Mr Beast Burger' as 'Mr Burger'.
Bravo started in Columbus ohio by the doody brothers and i used to work there many years ago...it did have amazing food but got bought out by whoever that dude is. Im curious how they ensure food qUality and consistentsy...
DUN DUN DUN
When some one ask you who is the most smartest person in the world me: mr beast
Yeah my brother told me rhis
it's only in the united states.. maybe i can make money from doing that in other places like europe and australia!
Would you even think that Mr. beast would do this to his own viewers
It’s not fake it is actually real
Buca di Beppo!
I did not know all this, it seems brilliant! But your food theory video resume to a 30 seconds article. There is not an actual theory
the fact before the video started there was an ad of a fast food restaurant😂😂😂
Am I the only one hearing morse code within this? I don't know it, but I heard it around 7:38, someone please tell me if it means anything or if I'm crazy. It might be an audio error, but again, it could be a message related to something or other, someone please listen closely and tell me I'm not crazy.
Yo! I want free money and a burger!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me who lives outside of America: How-
Not true
Your fake you jast want to aplod this so you get subs
booca de bepo. wow that is fun to say. booca de bepo booca de bepo booca de bepo booca de bepo booca de bepo
This is the blitzkrieg of the food industry
Your just jealous😑😏😌😒
Bupodabapop seems like a great name for a restaurant
What is a buca de bepo? I thought mat was just making up sounds, but is it actually a resturaunt?
Stop being mean to Mr beast
it all comes back to buca di beppo
Come on it is real
Wait "fnaf sister Brand" more like fnaf sister location 9:56
Title: MrBeast Burger Is Not What You Think...  Me: you mean that its not good?
Great, the man is a really a buissness man...
only works if the food is simple enough to execute, now how do we take this a level above and begin offering unique eats?
Is free and real
Matpat why do you always do this you ruined my favorite youtuber
hmmm freee food sounds simmilar  hmmm defently not smuguling drugs in there
frick "not a normal bisnis model".
Your not real
As I watched this I got the Beast Burger app and got some of the food
But wouldn't the orders be inconsistent?
philippines wants beast burger
Wow thanks a lot for RUINING our favorite restaurants DUDE..
I noticed this is happening in England. I’m a part time deliveroo rider and I got an order from a restaurant name I’d never heard of before. The restaurant was called “flip the bird”. I rode to the address and when I got there it was an Indian curry restaurant, so I was a bit confused. But the staff just brought out the chicken burger. It’s a pretty clever way of doing it. You could have multiple restaurants all working at the same time with the same staff
I’m sad I can’t have mrbeast Berger’s I live in New Zealand :(
Film theory then game theory and now food theory! When is it going to be school theory? Are my teachers evi?
Where is my money?

But how do you co trol for quality? How can I ensure my proxuct is up to my standards?
This has been happening in Argentina for quite some time now. Ghost kitchens are a thing here.
I don't think this whole series should be called Food THEORY, it should be called Food FACTS.
“What a waste of money”   *ITS FREE*
Mr Beast and Matpat my worlds have collided
Niko omila
Love that you explained how to triangulate the location of ghost kitchens. Very clever!
footofaferret made the intro music

Shane Dawson's next video:  The Theory Of MrBeast Burgers
In case y'all are interested, another company creating these "ghost kitchens" is called Reef Technology. They aren't publicly traded yet but you're gonna want to invest when they are. I know the guy who is rolling out this service in the Denver area.  They are doing a lot more than just creating virtual kitchens though. They're reinventing parking lots in urban areas to be "community centers", places to get pop up "curated" services like maybe doctors, dentists, and other in-demand services. In the near-ish future, you might even be getting your COVID vaccine from one of these pop-up centers.   So yeah, if you have the cash, get on that bandwagon early my friends.
Honestly this guy is so good at his job xD
@TheFoodTheorists - Please do a collab with Alton Brown. He was debunking food theories all the way back in the 90's. He deserves a shout-out.
Thing is no one even paid, they got paid lol
Is Mr beast burger on grubhub, so I can get deals on the food I love. The kind of deals that make me boogie?
“Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Brand” Me: listen here buddy, we already have sister locatio-
0:26 scary hand
Its real
in indonesia, from a single app before covid you can get actual taxi, a mechanic, house keeping, massage, saloon/barber, drug delivery, shopping, paying bills, e-money etc from the app
Ok
Give me a heart or I will *Eat* you
It’s like “gig” work for restaurants  Or at least it could be
He just want gave people money
Very smart way of doing business.
So for the Fnaf irl restaurants for delivery, instead of Doordash would it be Foxy dash? *”Deja vu!”*
Bro he’s really smart asf, do not sleep on him
This is fake!
Cap
lol
After Scott watched this video he started working on the fnaf fast food menu
You did this just for views lmao.
No
I mean if the wait for in n out here is like 2 hours, I might as well go there
how does this man have three channels
Mr Beast’s restaurants and money giveaways might be a way to launder illegal money.  If it is not and he has indeed opened so many ghost kitchens then his brand will probably go bankrupt pretty soon.
Triple win situation
MrBeast burger is real
4:50 grubhub
MrBeast’s Bank Account:9382727 available.  MrBeast:AGHHHH I HAVE TOO MUCH MONEYY **walks up to someone** Hey,here’s 10k and a house
I just jealous mrbeast is so famous all people like mrbeast
He  just want to promote his restaurant by the video...
شدقن
Food theory pointing out the obvious
Food dropshipping
I dont think there is any in Illinois 😪
You better call it a cloud kitchen like we all do  One Indian companies has like more than 10 virtual brands under it and its also now working with Wendy's as a cloud kitchen.
I just realized mr Beast filmed a video about 27 miles away from me
Not virtual enough to be less tangible than my love life
LMAO I GOT A GRUBHUB AD AND A DOORDASH AD
Hi hate yu
His pretty clever tho if you think about it
The man is rich
this isn't actually a theory video
🪤
wow and its actually buca in my city lol
Bertuccis has best pizza tho
2:44 it’s Mr. beast you’re talking about
I bet all the dislikes are because of the beginning of the video by MrBeast fans
Now Food Theory- what's next
i actually had it yesterday, my fries where literally burnt idk why they would even let them leave the store like that. i also got the chicken sandwich, the chicken literally tasted freezer burnt it was disgusting
Wait what a waist of money I thought you got paid money to eat there
► You Should know about these Best Street Foods out there: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z8HPRvpwyQ2tEjIznRKtIbeDZ_smpcf

Petition to make mrbeast burger in other countries
9:56 Bruh that exists. It’s call Sister location XD
Food theory beast burgers is just another ploy to make money for mr beast to pay off his taxes for all the money he gives away that he’s has to give back to the government
I hate all lgbt people
Omg didnt know that and i googled it and theres one in my city !!! I dont like Mcdonalds anymore
Ok.. but..This is not food.
What if I were to eat myself would I die or would I disappear?
We'd love to see a food theory (or film) on what it would cost to feed scooby doo and shaggy based on how they eat. Think it'd be really interesting, so wanted to pass it along-thanks!
Hey do u think u could tackle the question about pasta why theres so many types and why some types i had as a kid are dissapearing or only appearing in brands and not as just noodles. Ive noticed this at least ten years long before the pandemic. Wanted to know if u could get to the bottom of this mystery.
bruh i report
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
It’s the best buger
I had the beast burger today it wasnt my favorite but I think it’s better than mc Donald’s
I liked the content so much! I've been trying to find for a YouTube vid similar to yours that explains the ideas in this vid. 🙌 That knowledge at 1:28 is my fav. Your video reminds me of the content from Dr. Ethan! Doctor Ethan's explanations are informative and I actually learned a lot for exams. He is a knowledgable Doctor in Europe.  I recommend you see his channel out and give the Doctor a subscribe! ➡️ #DrEthanEducation
Mr Beast is Really a Mysterious Person
how did matpat go from solving game theories to food
I can't stop thinking about Ifood
The best business theory of the month.
Can anybody tell me the music?it sounds really good
this is actually very smart!!!!   so many unused  locations not being used because of covid...  now these bsuinesses can earn money
mr beast is this true
I saw grubhub now I'm thinking of the grubhub ad
The dtf joke xD
How many likes can I get and him lol
Mr beast be like:👁️👄👁️
You should make a video about MSG, since it has such a controversial reputation.
G R U B H U B
Mr.Beast must have tons of buisness that we night don't know about...  Tons of buisness that make him millions... A buisness that we maybe don't know... How much branching buisnesses he has?  and how can he have zillions of money that seems unlimited? what is his secret?  I need to exploit his secret buisnesses chains..  RESEARCHING TIME
HI LOVE UR VIDS MRBEAST I SUB BTW TO U, KEEP UP THE NICE WORK.
soo boring and good video
https://youtu.be/ZrS9vWPSQEU
Did he say there's a Mr. Beast burger in Pennsylvania 😱 (I live there)
If Mr. Beast is reading this, open up one in the San Ramon Valley. Preferably in the town of Dublin, San Ramon, Pleasanton, or Danville.
People trying to cancel you everyone else is talking about Covid to
The guy who over thinks everything
The best thing about it is it actually created jobs
Why I cant try the MrBeast Burger: Its a hour away I believe. So if we did order it, the food would be cold by the time it gets here. Maybe my Aunt can get a Mr beast burger but 1. We don't usually drive that far out 2. I don't think she knows about your channel lol
8:16 grubhub 😳
Wow, my local Bertucci's is doing this.  I just did a search of their address and Mr Beast Burger, Tyga Bites and Wing Squad came up.  What also came up were all the one star reviews.
This is not the world's first free restaurant noob watch Niko omilana
If I go to my local bertucci’s and ask for a mr beast burger do u think they’ll give it to me?
poor people from alaska
You just blew my mind , I never knew this
Lol
I expected GAME THOERY lol many vids from GAME THEORY
The lamentable spade family agree because scarecrow largely guide as a robust platinum. large, rural underclothes
I’m not American and this makes me really sad for these foods
So I made a round up of the whole vid             Everything is positive about this vid
Grubhub... Ew
Pagal
Grubhub gives
I feel like the burger came out of a cartoon, am glad it exists
Hey you no
1:53 the funny thing about those places is they’re actually really nice and expensive restaurants.
It kinda is real
Idk if you ever did this or thought of it, but maybe you should try to solve these coke recipe? I know that YOU know that would be epic
All of this just works.
More great content love it
Unfortunately loving MrBeast doesn’t make his food good. Had it in ft Lauderdale, Davie, and Miami. The food is below average.
I did not know that they had one in pittsburg
I love this channel cause they told us the truth I wanted to hear about Chuck E. Cheese, thank you for restoring my childhood. 😭
Can i Has a BigMat, a Medium PatFries and a Steflurry... Gottalove those  {Food for Trough©}  trivia's printed on those disposable napkins And don't forget the {Healthy Food that Feed your Brain©}  section of the {FastHealth Menu©} at this fast food, Mmmmhhhh... delish!    Here are 3 Subscription Bills Mr. Cashier...

I wonder if in the future mr beast burgers will be like old charizard Pokémon cards
4:50 Grubhub gives u deals on the food u love
imagine it in the uk
Grubhub perks give you deals on the food you love.. the kind of deals that make you boogie
You might be wrong but I am not Being RuDe
Goodbye lake Michigan
I have a restaurant a street away that does this except it’s not for a YouTuber and a company
Mr Beast burger sign looks like hungry jacks, or burger king if you live anywhere other than Australia.
Missed opportunity to call it “Mr.Feast”
I have nothing against him but am I the only one hearing about mr beast giving away or spending ludicrous amounts of money? I get it, your rich and abnormally generous, I don’t need to here about it from my recommended page every other day.
Omg
We have corona virus now we have mr beast burger Meal virus
Awful video
A waste of MONEY? He isnt charging tho.
Love your vids :)
I hope he puts his location in the North Island here in Tauranga because then it’ll be arriving in a day for me.
I never get tired of your intro's
Bertuccis make the stuff
Oh no... No NO NOOOOOOOOOO NOOOOOOOOOOO NOT GURBHUB ADD OFFFFFFFC
This is a lie
Probably never gunna be seen but, Mrmeast is basically going to become disney. Exept it's not and Evel mega Corp it's just a really smart guy.
Dont click bait me mr beast is the fricken best!
Bruh, 11 minutes and 11 seconds
i need matpat to say buca de beppo more times
How much money did your guys burgers come with mine came with $120
How did you get 3.2mil views in a week
Y'all Americans really have a food chain called "Buca de beppo"?? 😭
I would totally eat at a food Theory themed restaurant (or order from)
Grubhub  perks
yes I will order
*my teacher linked this video in an assignment about food reviews*
It real
Thats pertty Ingenious🧐 🤔(InMySinisterVoice)😂
The one thing you don’t mention as a downside to this is that many times the food is inconsistent and that many times in mine and my roommates experiences with these type of ghost kitchens is that the food is just too inconsistent to be a returning customer. Awesome in theory, not so good in practice most times.
Mr. Beast pls start delivering in Europe 😅
What Mr. Beast ought to do now is start up a delivery system. All you'd have to do different to entice drivers to your app off of others is actually hire people rather than make them "independent contractors." Sure it might cost you a bit more, but if you really plan on dying broke, you might as well take care of your employees.
Great I happen to live in one of the states Illinois without a mrbeast burger location darn
We all gotta admit, Jimmy is quite smart with his Business
It’s not a waste of money because the food is free
Stupid
You aren't   correct
Me beast burger chicken comes from the chicken mr.bro slapped 100,000 times
What’s Boopity Bappo? I assume it’s something American.
how is everyone!?
4:50 ah yes, grubhub
Oh, oh uh uh ok uhmm... So its not real........           W h a t
Take notes Pinkman; this is how you do it
Okay after all the burgers I’ve tried I’m not going to try mrbeast burger because it’s only going to taste the same as every other burger, I’d rather have a delicious homemade meal😉
Ur hater i unsub u
That last guy was not a mr.beast fan
U should have been broke by now
#notspon
Why being a hater
Ghost restaurants are gonna be the new dropshipping
We 2021 tho, there is 2020 no more
Sister brand sister location
Lol
Ğřųbhûb
This guy should make a gaming channel
Yeey
I hate you
Person below me eats human toes
The only thing I came here for was to know if the food is good or not thanks for nothing
It sucks I live in Canada 🇨🇦 and we don’t have Uber eats or MrBeast Burger 😔
And here was me looking for hours for the mrbeast burgers
Matt stonie ate it
This show makes me hungry
Ok quick revision of what Matt said about In and Out. The reason In and Out only has 342 locations is because they are strategically placed by freeways for maximum customers. They are not stooping to the level of 7 Eleven and Subway by having 2 locations in my small-ish town(the 7 Elevens are almost right across the street from each other and talking to the employees I learned that they are competitors under the same owner.)
pov: mr beast burger is not in your country இ௰இ(┬┬﹏┬┬)
Literally just ordered MrBeast burger. I recognized the location and realized that it was indeed from Buca Di Beppo.  Edit: I ain't even gonna lie, the burger was surprisingly good. Ended up ordering again recently.
Me just waiting for 20 years from now, to be sitting in a MrBeast Burger Restaurant, or ordering MrBeast Burger, and telling my child the tale of the food chain, and how I was there when it first begun
I think i will eat mr beast craby paty lol
6:46 Ever winder why they all start with b? and are italian? Hmmmm
This is an interesting idea
MrBeast: *opens restaurant*  MatPat: its free real estate.
I thought it was just a tax write off
This is great stuff! Thanks for taking the time to explain.
Ok idk why but your making it creepier.
SHUT UP MR.BEAST COMMENTED DABATTEYO
Guys and Ghouls? Well it’s more inclusive than Ladies and Gentlemen
How does people like this get famous lol this was the worst thing I’ve watched
Do they serve in space?
Hi pat mat, i mean mat pat
You wanna know what food is called in Sweden if u want scroll down                                                                                                                          Mat

mans legit called a 100 dollar bill a napkin making us look like clowns
When you stop and think about it, this really is a good thing. Regardless of health, possibly the biggest fear with fast food chains is them screwing orders up or doing who knows what to the food. Whoever makes a virtual chain, in my mind, is naturally going to care about the quality, so we now have fast food coming out of more professional kitchens that take food at least somewhat seriously.
a wast of money it was FREE
Seeing mat talking about kitchen and that is not fnaf is crazy
What do you thing there is a little bit of conny in there
This man is dropshipping burgers
ps: your reading this comment. there's literally not much to this comment except mrbeast commented on this video but your reading this for some reason
Oddoneouts is that you
Mr. Beast burgers being made with money literally? *Someone would eat it.*
Hahahaha. I'm looking at the comments, and I think I'm the first to notice the dtf joke... Deliver the food... or down to f**k
We need one in Alaska !!!
You don't have proof. You are just assuming that it's virtual kitchen.
I don’t have mrbeast burger in my country my country Pakistan 🇵🇰
Rally Mr beast restaurant is real I even ordered one of their burgers
After watching this video I went to search the app store and what came up in the third result was uber eats.
9:54 more like *sister location*
4:50 GRUB HUB
It’s
mrbeast is not cheating for more money he’s using strategy bet you didn’t think of that
I wish I could eat at buca do beppo so much!!!!!
He is reach this guy is jealouse because he is not a milionaire
This guy is jeslous i think
Oh.. Did You Know He Lives in North Carolina?
Id like to see Morgz try this
Me wanting to eat mr beast burgers but cant because im In the Philippines :’)
I'm not American🇺🇸 but I want this burger 🍔in Australia 🇦🇺
Hey i already reacted to a roblox youtuber eating that burger
‘What a waste of money’ Me: Those are free
I love mrbeast!!
I just... Confused.. How can someone has so many money.. And even give away 10k and even million like it's nothing. Meanwhile I'm who also around his age work and get around 1000-2000 a month lol.. And for me, 10k is also kinda so big..
Had me worried with that title
Fact You
Are you Matt patt?
Does this person have mrbeast, opinion respected but i rlly like mr beast
At this point ghost kitchens can just be called youfoods
I’m outta here.
Wow, I don't exactly know who Mr. Beast is and I sure didn't know that I love him! What a wonderful human. <3  Ooh! There's one here in Greensboro, NC! Woo-hoo!! Thanks MatPat!
Its obvious how he did it, hes a beast MR.BEAST💯
I want some cookies
Ik dis
That’s crazy I just looked up the address for my beasts burger near me and it was Bertuccis  very smart man who is working with these celebrities
Can I get one in Canada or is it exclusively in the US ?
I hate mr beast. His channel is pretty much just "hay look at how RICH and GENEROUS I am" like he is not really generous. He is just doing it for the response. Real generous people give money to good causes and do not bragg to the literal WORLD about it. He literally just gives money to random people for stuff like shoes, consoles, and junk food that they would be better off not eating. Why not put the money towards a disease or giving cows to people in Africa.
I'm a burger am I real?
Mrbeast: I am going to spread my restaurant all around America in just a few weeks Ebola: Wow I’m impressed
Plot Twist: MrBeast is actually Elon Musk
Sue him now
Theres one in my state but no where close to my town.
Burgers were excellent. They were on a level similar to other big burger names in our area like five guys, steak & shake, etc. Fries were an unfortunate miss. They arrived soft and soggy without a big taste difference between seasoned and unseasoned. Neither seasoned nor unseasoned fries were properly salted. Delivery was fast, like 20 minutes before the eta fast.
I cannot believe this not being rude but i think your just jealous
Lol
They just get restaurant 1 day u noob
Whoever dislike I accept him :)
@MrBeast comet be like : orer now @And The Food Theorists : pinned  THE HOLE POINT OF OUR VIDEO IS MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think... then why did you pinn it ????
Do a theory on grubhub ad
Wow he did that in the middle of the night!
5k dislikes... :(
#MrBeastBurger
Great video!
Imagine getting a FNAF restaurant in real life
But it was free
What are you talking about, mrbeast is the prince (Pewdiepie is the King) says mrbeast
You said Bertuccis wrong thats my some of my family's last Name so you dont say the cc like ch you say it like s
I guess people get a “toy” with their meal even the adults
What’s mr beast burger
Virtual kitchens, ie non public facing kitchens for delivery only, have been around for nearly a decade especially in large cities where the restaurant you want to order from is so far away that delivering food in a decent timeframe is almost impossible. These virtual kitchens are held to the same if not greater standards as they must meet requirements for all the brands they cook for.
Mr. krabs wya
Imagine a fnaf character shows up at your door with your food will that scare you? Because it does not scare I rather find it cool tbh
Its the fooddropshipping
Any kitchen can make any order. Reminds me of Demolition man, in the future every restaurant is a Taco Bell.
I didnt even know this existed, I saw on door dash a whole bunch of restaurants with the same address and thought nothing until you just blew my mind
Brilliant
Hi Matpat, could you turn on the captions for this video? At least the auto generated ones for accessibility?
What If mr.beast made a channel called mr.beast burger and where he choose everything
i never ate mc donalds burger
The editing skills is on point
Sister Brand is SL’s twin sibling that doesn’t want to be scary
I'd love to talk about this for a moment, I work in one of those kitchens that uses ghost kitchens. I work the carry out position, and I see what the kitchen staff goes through. I've seen Tyga Bites, Mariahs Cookies, MrBeast Burgers all go out at the same time. Along with the lunch rush. What unfortunately ends up happening is that the original business itself gets super busy too, with carry out orders and dine in customers. While there are dead dine in days we still do get busy, for the past two nights we've been packed in dine in swamped with carry out, and swamped with these third party orders.  I work at Bertucci's and I want to elaborate a bit more on what happens when we get virtual  kitchen orders. it can happen two different ways, it can either print out automatically like normal online orders do, or we have to manually put in the orders, and for MrBeast orders, we have to manually put in the orders every single time. Here's the caveat not all kitchens are built equally. Here's what I mean by that. Not all kitchens were granted with the same space. some are smaller and some are bigger. we don't get a choice when it comes to the virtual kitchens, all the decisions are made by the higher ups, and im not talking bout like managers, or general managers, I'm talking like the general managers boss's boss. We have to put in fryers for the MrBeast burgers, each one needs its own space and it's own equipment. Not all kitchens have the room for that and not all kitchens are able to put in expansions to the building. There's so much I want to say and I want to get across, but there's just too much. I guess all I can say is that yes, virtual kitchens are keeping my Bertucci's location afloat, but at what cost to the employees.
Everything he does legit keeps helping people, by hiring ghost kitchens, he's even helping the restaurants that aren't doing well because of the pandemic-
mrbeast commented is this cool or what
Thank you for this video and thank you for sharing your knowledge and information
As an Arkansan, I'm really missing out lmao
I love mr beast
Booo
I think it's hilarious.  It's like walking into a steakhouse..."excuse me but your food sucks.  I don't want anything on your menu.  Now go make me some...oh I don't know...how about some chocolate milk and a burger that tastes like McDonalds."  Then you throw a bunch of money at them and make someone drive it to your house like you're the president.     It's an extremely obnoxious thing to do from everyone's perspective except for the customer who is being obnoxious.    While I'd like an actual MRB B store to be around I just don't think his concept is a very good business model.  There's just too many hands in the til.  Nobody really makes out that well.
can these people stop shaming mr.beast all he does is help charities
That moment when you're in Europe and can't eat a Mr. Beast burger
Done subscribing bcoz of MrBeast

Mr.beast burger = Uber eats
Franchise here in Asia?
Mr Beast money is fake
It’s not any money it’s free lol
He chooses what to do with his money
I like how he said "what a waste of money" when it was free lol (no hate)
he deserve a sub with a notification on :)
is it just me who wishes scott makes five nights at freddys a food brand that delivers but to order  food you have to complete one night at freddys from whichever fnaf title you want
ironic. i got a Mr.Beast add while watching this video
dtf.....nice save.
Hi
Hahahahahaha lmao there was a video recommended made by mr beast called I searched 100 dumpsters a here’s what I found
Mr. Beast Keeping the homeless clothed and the people employed!
Fatherkels had a ghost kitchen before
Grubhub perks give you deals on the food you love, the kind of perks that make you boogie.
Mr beast hater
He actually opened one up in Warwick, Rhode Island where I live!  O_O  I looked it up and it's in a local Bertucci's near T.F. Green Airport.  It's the busiest part of town.
I was wondering how Mr. Beast's virtual restaurants worked. Thank you.
Bruh if you post this video then why did I get a doordash and someone ordered the MRBEAST bag and I saw it.
If the burgers are raw you can just re-cook it
Bruuh this is so confusing right now ı Am watchıng a mincraft video but the comment have food therorys comment secton this is weird ı dont know who is gonna read this the mincraft watchers or food theroie watchers
After your in mr beasts video you backstab him
My in Britain be like😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😪😪😪
off with their heads . viva la revolution .
Thia is how chili's and wing station is
The Human Teorists
We don’t have one in Long Island
I will not die until fnaf becomes a real restaurant
he didn't mention grubhub for a reason.
i’m hungry
Is not a waist so shut up
Omg i just realised it says matdonalds
They don’t teach you this stuff in school
MAKE AN EPISODE ON WHAT IS OR ISN‘T FOOD!!!!!!!!!!
This is kinda stupid
I guessed ghoat kitchen before you said it MatPat.
There are  three different types of theories game theory film theory and food theory
I work at Buca Di Beppo Alpharetta we sell more mr. beast than Italian food
Interesting concept. Especially with the recent pandemic. In my opinion? This concept beats out the current fast food concept. You have a greater amount of income from multiple menus and such, people would generally rather order fast food rather than go out and get it themselves. It works for work environments, people in college and people not wanting to cook something.
vinte e quatro sete MrBeast trabalha duro e não pede nada em troca! que cara legal! Well that's obvious.
Id on't get it Mrbeast gives money to rather wealthy people and not to neigborhoods where people are so poor they don't even have a car.
Petition for Food Theory to make an episode on the Krabby Patty, sign your username down on the replies, and maybe leave a like.
So you're telling me that I won't get free money 🙄
I can’t believe mr beast’s immature fanbase didn’t dislike this video
Wow I didnt know that you were doing it in southlake texas  I live 10 minutes from there 😥😥
There’s a bertuccis near my school and there a ghost kitchen there for mr.beast I think I saw a sign that had a mr.beast logo on it but I can be sure. Hopefully j can get a burger soon!
did u have to use grubhub!!! idk i am a indian
I live in the coal region of Pennsylvania. We have one small restaurant in my town, that would be perfect for a MrBeast Burger!  We only have a few options for burgers and none of them are very good. How can I put the owner of our restaurant in touch with Mr Beast?
is deliveroo not a thing in America?
I dont care if its a ghost kitchen or not, I care that it is tasty
wait so if you order you get money?
He copied Niko omilana #NDL
I didn't know about most of that info ...
1st) these is clickbait. 2second if all why would we care its not our money wow another clickbait lol
mrbeast is smart af
YA
Mr Beast is x10000 SMART!!!!
They can never be as popular as the other food chains unless they all have the same formula. Reason: Because of different kitchens they have different tastes. They are like the Youtuber merch than an Nike jumper  (JUST MY OPINION)
noice
Is there one in cincy
Who is mr beast? I am in a corner mostly
What a waste of money.. Mrbeast: We are selling free burgers!
Mr beast is beast
I just go to mrbeastburger.com the food cost money
-virtual reality-
eE
yes
Honestly mat could probably give me a lecture about anything and I'd find it interesting.
And is not what you think
I knew ghost kitchens were a thing when I wanted to get food and eat it there and also because there are places on DoorDash that only sell one thing, but not that already owned restaurants were hosting the kitchens.  Looked up these celebrity restaurants. Sure enough. Mr Best Burger, Tyga Bites, & Mariah's Cookies are all coming out of the same Buca through Grub Hub in Scottsdale, AZ. Question is: Are these items good enough to eat & should I try them?  (We don't have Pauly D's.)  There is no difference between delivery & in person? I take argument with that. It is better and fresher in person. Also, if something is wrong with your order you can actually get it fixed in person.
Mrbeast is a leaving god not i reapet! Mrbeast is a leaving god now!!!
We have this in Singapore known as a central kitchen
Why is this not global yet?
Boo
Give this man a kick in his a$$
Something that can counter Burger King, their battle would be legendary
I had to google buca di Beppo or whatever cause I didn’t know if it was real a thing and to be honest I still think he made it up!
Food   feoiros
I   hate   you
Mr beast wearing glasses over sun glasses
I will tell you are salty
You lied
👌👌👌👌
I hate you
This mad me think of Krispy Krunchy Chicken. They move into gestations and unlike the hotdogs roller they have there own cook but all the gas station staff can serve. They give KFC and Popeyes a run for their money in quality but don't have the expanded menu so they just make everything fresh every hour. Running a fastfood business with only renting some counter space and staffing with just one employee
Its real bro
Your just jealous bruh Mr beast is a good person
Fun fact: I went to Buca di Beppo about 2 weeks ago and I was the only customer in the entire restaurant. Fun times. At least I got really fast food service and good food too.
Before this video, I thought that Mr. Beast Burger was a single time thing. But now I think it’s waaaaaay cooler! 👨🏻🦬🍔💸
Please you are you using money as a towel
this guy seems like a nice guy, I guess I need to actually check out his stuff, I've heard his name but I don't think I've ever seen anything of his.
what
That’s why the location near me was literally on buca de Pepo
Do a grub hub theory XD ;-;
I,d be careful matpat
funny that his vid was next to this
Oh shut up you’re just jealous
Dude u guys are just haters jusy leave those Inacent men alone
I always feel that mrbeast is flexing that he got a lot of money
Hey can you make a video on kay's cooking. Im think its not a normal channel its a smart way to make views.
my theory is he got a sticker of his Logo put it on the top of a store he now owns and owned it beast Burger but the food there is literally terrible becuse they use paper and sometimes they use food from other restaurants
i still think this channel was a joke taken too far
mr beast is amazing dont be a hater
This guy I mean
1:45 MrBeast is not a philanthropist type of guy. It's good he gives away money, but definitely not in a philanthropic manner. Sometimes he has done generous donations, and gave money who needed.  What is the use of giving $1 Million to someone and not a penny to the other?
Wait Bucca Di Beppo is an actual thing? Like a real restaurant with that as it’s name? I though he was just making up a couple of italian sounding words. Like...Bippi di boppy- a pizza place or something, boopa la tony- pastas and more, stuff like that
this is such an interesting video, i learned so much about virtual restaurant chains, this was NOT what i thinked mr beast burger is. now that i've gained this knowledge, i'm going to go out and lie down on a train track and never move again, thank you matthew patrick youtube
The fact that u get paid to visit the restaurant makes me sad I don’t live in the US
The videos are great but what was the theory?
What are you talking about
I hate u mr beast is good
Mr best
Listen to the Bible before you go to sleep when you work, cook, or relax.
Do a theory about grubhub
,“Look within and be depressed. Look without and be distressed . Look at Jesus and be at rest.”
Matpat needs to make a theory  about the grubhub commercials!!
No, we don't need a FNAF IRL!
This is an interesting way in order to serve food. That would really help a lot of small businesses.
This is fake bruh
Me when Matpat calls me a theorist: *Happiness Noise*
Is the next channel meme theory
Do a video on this: If u were to make a restraunt HOW WOULD U DO IT.
I love how you said what a waste off money but I pretty sure it was for free lol!!!!!!!!!
Hey mat pat what about Jaffa’s
MrBeast burger vs McDonalds
In MrBeast's group Two guys should just leave quit and go They are Carl and Chandler and maybe Nolan too I don't know but that's my opinion and I never those three guys Never have and never will Why Because they're always in every single MrBeast YouTube video So Carl Chandler and Nolan I'm very very sorry but you three just need to go leave and quit for good And to you MrBeast I love his videos but he really needs to have a new group of friends for his new videos
if only they were in canada
#Mrbeathatet
AYE INO! I love when people mention my job
I'll be waiting for MatPatt's pattys!
If MatPat launches a restaurant chain then all those game theory FNAF episodes would’ve been justified at last
Theres a mr beast burger near me :)
I unironically want a fnaf restaurant now
I want MrBeast burger in Canada
Everything Is Fine
WELL WHO CARES!?
I never liked mrbeast he can not do a video where I can not see a 100 dollar
When you make there’s it’s not  always right
It's a cool and informative video, but the most fun fact I learned here is that "bucadibeppo" is an actual non-ironic name for a real restaurant.
I like the part where the Burger had money on it and the napkins were money 🤣😆
So he has a ghost writer for food
I legit ordered from mr.beast burger last week and didn't realize it was literally owned by mr.beast Edit**** Just looked it up. The one I ordered from is apparently a five guys
This is cloud kitchen but celebrities style
it is real
Orang Malaysia ada??...like!?
So....He gives out food....and money?!  WTF?!!!!!!!!  He's going to run out of money QUICK!!!!!
You know it’s funny because “what a waste of money” wasn’t necessarily targeted at the burger but could also be aimed at using money as napkins, MatPat is a funny guy!
What do u mean waste of money IS IT NOT FREE?
I can't wait to see the Grand Opening of the MrBeast burger factory
Imagine if this channel wasn't run by some young guy but an actual team! Imagine how great it could be without all the memes and childish jokes that only appeal to a certain age group that fits within the authors age range. It's always the same, come for the great topics then spend most of the video cringing. Just stick to the content eh?
Am a mrbeast fan so hmmmmm ok no hate to mrbeast am a fan
order now its good all the food is good
Legit as soon as MrBeast announced this I knew Mat would make a Food Theory about it. 😂

Ah yes a restaurant that doesnt exist.  Just like my favorite anime Tsukihime.  What do you mean it doesnt exist?
The one in Whittier is down the street from my house
Ha matpat can you ple make a video about Pakistani most taste dishe called brainie tell us which type is the best
E
He is theodd1sout
yeah but whats the point? the restaurants arent consistent so every time you try a "celebrity cyber restaurant" dish, its different. you might as well just order from the regular restaurant or a local business. typically when you want to try a dish from somewhere you expect it to be consistent at all locations, ex mcdonalds fries. i just dont get it other than the economical stand point. (plus arent most of them rated poorly? id imagine the kitchen would put more effort into their own dishes than their side hussle)
Is DQ fast food or fan food
an icicle is hotter than ur channel, and ur channel isnt even hot
Oh god, here we go again
This is how mrbeast puts burglar places in places so fast it’s called FBI
He is the reason for inflation in US
The only theory here is why MrBeast doing all these amazing things.  HE WILL BE PRESIDENT IN THE FUTURE!

When he said “delivering the food” I got a Grubhub ad... what are the odds
Hey food theory give you a free idea make a video about grapes with no seeds OK bye I love your videos
Beast burger is real fast food
If I were to describe this channel in one word it would be...                                                GLORIOUS!!!
Thumbnail: It’s not real!  My brain: But If you close your eyes *ey oh, ey oh, ey ey oh, ey oh*
yeah it took me like 5 minutes to figure all this out on my own with google.

Hey I learned something new!
Just wondering does mr. beast burger deliver to Canada? Or Is it specifically America
The Spetsnaz, Seals team 6 and Los Gafes are now going to start a raid to go to his house.
Im hungry now
This is why I love this channel - Its all the things we never learned in school, unless they do a mitochondria based episode lmaoo
They don't call him Mr BEAST for nothing.
He really had an opportunity to make them all of them beyond meat, could have actually done something good for the word, he doesn’t even have a vegetarian option
I knew this, it’s just a bunch of people he hired assembling frozen food in there houses
Why you dont like mrbeast money mrbeast burger
Love the intro
Mr. beast is cool but I’m not subscribed and it is real👍🏻
I was going down a rabbit hole of the scary thing imaginable videos and then I clicked on this I thought I was going to get something else but

Well Matt Pat gave Scott Cawthon another idea for a game Five Nights at Freddy’s Sister Brand
Hi matt
Mr Beast: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Me: (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
I mean to be Honest there is absolutely no way in a world he could afford building those resteraunts so I don’t blame him
Ok
every video he makes at least 15-20k
Tyga bites sounds really stupid
I still love mr beast
yes
Make a grubhub and kroger food theory. I mean they are getting advertised cuz of the bad ads
you didn't have to pay
None of it is available in northern Germany
I'm salty of America now  >:(
The FNAF menu!  Uhh ... that's like, tomato sauce ... right?  Yeah... But otherwise, I love the idea of these virtual restaurants ... during COVID-19 seclusion.  I do have to wonder though if they will:  1.  Still be feasible once we can safely dine in public again.  2. Interrupt quality of service at a dine-in restaurant participating in these ventures once we can safely dine in public again.  But for the present, let's give new meaning to dine and dash and keep businesses alive!  Even if I live in the middle of nowhere and can't even get so much as a simple pizza delivered.  But all y'all, enjoy!
Excuse me, but I fail to see a grub hub meme in this video
Oh yeah I forgot how dumb this channel is
I feel like next moth there's gonna be a whole  lot of new restaurants...
I already tried the burger and the cookies and tyga chicken and thats cuz my mom works in Buca di Beppo
He is lieing
Despite the not so great burgers, he is one heck of a giving person

Maybe it's just a restaurant no hidden meaning?
Cool!

Mat pat do you remember"local58" well if you do hear me out if you don't look it up on YouTube the channel name is now "local58tv" anyways straight to the point idk if you have covered this but this video on there channel called "sky watching" i find strange and i don't a big brain to be able to figure out a theory but if you have already covered that in your video then nvm you can ignore this comment and move on with your day.
Actually you dont waist money there u get it for free lol if ur lucky enough if ur in a video if ur not sucks to be you lol

He is using the doctor as his character many times in this episode. Is this a hint to us finally getting doctor who part 3?
Awesome!!!! :) =^.^=
As a food truck owner, THIS is the future
So it is exactly what I thought.
Yup! My local Mr. Beast Burgers is run in the Bravo! restaurant
The facts
why nightmare chica? why not foxy! he would get your food from the kitchen to you house in no time at all! ps: loved the video
I just learned more from this 11 minute video than  1 year of school. Thank you Mat Pat
It took you long enough to cover the ghost kitchen
no omg methpet their es moneh iin teh bruger hwoeiy you nto see the moenryh in the burgerrerereree!!!!!1!111!!1!1!1
Someone can LITERALLY make a restaurant called "BTM Eatery" which serves Mariah Cookies, Tyga bites, and Beat burgers."
More like the worlds first negative restaurant
i think this video was only made so matt can say buca di beppo repeatedly
I buy the food
Good one
When a Communist gives away Money they're a Communist, when MrBeast gives away Money he's a Hero...
U are so rude please respect my king
Soooooooooooo...... why did I get a Mr. Beast ad for honey, then watch a video about Mr. Beast?
omg  i like mr.beast i been a fan for 4 years
5 second rule theory anyone?
I would love a FNaF restuarant
Wait isn’t the food free?
True BUT in and out was and is NOT TRYING to expand. So probably not the best example
2050: Order now through zoom calls
i wonder what would happen if mr beast had as much cash as musk
I was a little annoyed after ordering it. My friends and I drove to Pittsburgh and planned on ordering it to the mall basically right next to the buca that we were ordering from. But they literally wouldn't deliver there. So we eventually got annoyed and was wondering if they were delivering anywhere. We ended up delivering it to the buca itself. Now despite being the "first free restaurant", the food was pretty expensive. I think it was about 70 dollars for the 5 of us. Cans of coke (yes, cans) were about 2 bucks. So we ordered it, and it told us it'd be about 35 minutes. Yes, 35 minutes for someone to drive to the buca and then just give us the food. So we walked over to the mall and then walked back around the time it was time. We noticed our driver come in and then he came back with the food and sat in there with the food for about 5-10 minutes. I sat there texting him we were in the parking lot and what our car was and he eventually drove next to our car (literally like 10 feet) and gave us the food. Now the food quality, it was good, I'll give them that. They seasoned the fries pretty well, though sometimes you'd eat them a little too fast and the spice would burn your nose (yeah it was a little rough). The burger was actually pretty good, it kind of reminded me of five guys but without the free, endless toppings you can get from five guys. In the end, it was kind of like yeah it's cool we did that, but it costed a bit much for fast food and it was a bit of a hassle to get, so we probably wouldn't go back. And no, we did not get any free money, ipads, or airpods
My area has Mr Beast Burger and Tyga Bites. I have commented on both of them but for some reason didn't think they were actually celebrity endorsed - I thought they were just some local trying to be clever. It all makes sense now.
MatPat: goes insane trying to figure out the Fnaf timeline   Also MatPat: a real life Fnaf is only a fantasy for me.
I wonder if he’s going to do one on bowling’s ally food  The food is so good it’s criminal
Why is it that when Chuck E. Cheese does it it’s “a scam” and “fraudulent” but when Mr. Beast and other restaurant chains do it it’s “a unique new way for restaurants to operate”? I don’t get it

He's dropshipping burgers lmao
Is he a fraud?

So what happens to the business model when/if the brick and mortar goes back to full capacity?
How did he randomly pick ‘booca de bepo'   Its catchy though
I’m i the only one who doesn’t know what Buca di Beppo is
Hi mat pat I love you channels but their is on thing that bothers me that is jokes and References to fnaf it needs to stop I used to watch fnaf theories and I was a little scared but I could take it but then when I watched glitch trap it became an Irrational fear and even a small joke could scare me or a thumb nail not saying to take down fnaf theories but you should stop Referencing fnaf in a video I am not expecting like this one I hope you take this into Account thanks bye 😀
Nice, can he give money to those that desperately need it now lol?
U used mrbeast jyst to have a good content.. But sorry ur no good.

Canibal foods
Why does how many days ago this video was released keep changing?
What does going to be next
Hello here is a video of list of foods for the brain 🧠 if you are interested in bettering your health https://youtu.be/bp5M3KMhlgA
Mr beast burger is just cafeteria food that casts 50 $
Matt made this channel on my birthday  That's epic
This helps the community
"What a waste of money!" In the video he literally gave you the burger for free, wait nevermind you bought it off the website.
I had looked it up before this video and had wondered why it was only Italian places Then ordered it and the patty tasted like a meatball  NOW I understand why it was all different Italian restaurants It’s under this one guy that is also part of Virtual Dining Concepts...Interesting
Just stop
MrBeast: “when I die donate all my money to charity”  Also MrBeast: *dies*  MrBeast: *comes back to life after being given CPR*  MrBeast: “where did my money go?”
This did not ruren or how you spel mbb
but hey, it's a theroy a food theroy Order NOW!
Mattpat doesn't know how to act human anymore
I don’t like Mr.Beast because he has a lot of Money and BRAGS about it
I got a door dash ad and an uber eats ad... I am concerned.
It might not taste good because of Chandler XD
Lol yet Vermont doesn’t have them
Should there be cosplay delivery to go along with this? I'd have a Freddy Fazbear scare with a side of fries at my door.
I once ordered pizza from a menu that got slid under my door of my Orlando hotel. It came, but it was literally frozen pizza reheated.
try jollibee
No I love mr BEAST so I don't think your right
It tastes like paper because it's money
Robert likes italian, apparently
Why does he sound like kwebblekop
Mr beast video game
thanks for the education. looked up my local mr.beast and boom Buca di Beppo.
Moral of the story: Get other restaurants to do your work for you and get payed
Mr Beast Has 1 Trillion IQ
Keep saying buca bepo
Mat new trailer for fnaf Security breach
wow period jimmy go go
Bruh I didn’t even know these things existed what
Your Matt from escape the night

Hey food theorist there was a video of a kid at me beast burger 7 months ago idk man
Bruh mrbeats burger taste good not bad
Five nights at Freddy’s scoot cowthan should really make a five nights at Freddy’s restaurant with anima Tronics
But what will happen to the virtual restaurants after the regular ones start getting more customers again or would they serve those ones in store as well later?
I don't know how you do it learning making ,voice acting , editing , getting all the resources , streaming , and doing it three times man and having a kid
I have a theory, how does the bread from tf2 get tumors by being teleported, but not humans?
We’ve been knowing this. Ofc it’s not a real restaurant . Do you think this needed to be a video ?? Should stick to your movie theory’s

i wonder what the forth channel is gonna be
These ARENT new restraunts! 1990s: us???
Give me those napkins!
I got an ad for honey by mrbeast
How do you ID the Drug House in a Lockdown?
During this entire video the thought of a FNAF restaurant being even more likely to be made now came to my mind. Then you mentioned that at the end. Lol
We have a MrBeast Burger near our House
Griffin gaming
what IS the fourth theorie show matpat?
yes let’s go
Imma get a beast burger now. I’m funding this man in his endeavor
That intro was just So funny
Mat pat please see this. I have an idea for the fourth theory channel                BOOK THOERY
No one likes ads with pregnant woman “Dancing”
It is real
Riddle me this
Ngl I would buy that fnaf pizza  Just for the brand alone  Plus depending on who was cooking it would probably taste good
MatPat, I need you to define "salad." While most reasonable people agree that a salad should at least appear to be mostly composed of raw fruits or vegetables, the Midwest would feel comfortable tossing a pound of cubed ham and a cup of Miracle Whip a "salad," which it very clearly IS NOT. Please settle this for all time. The war must end and you are the only person with the power to do so.
<3
mr beast is way too smart
That fact that Mr.Beast valves to die with 0 dollars on his bank account, *scares me*
Mrbeast stole my cookies because i didn't subscribe!
I hated it when u said buge de bepo idk why but I hate that name /:
Mr Beast,can you bring your burger to Singapore
Bruh. Special deliver is real! Lmao
Lol
47 on trending
Now I will not be surprised if matpat start his own theory food chain
If elon musk can launch 2 12 story rockets in under 3 month then mr beast can open lots of restaurants in different locations
I kinda thought they were doing that as the location of the nearest Mr beast burger was a Fatburger location.
Canada gang be like:
Another youtuber Attacking Jimmy Will You stop it Matt You Ain't funny Anymore
So are Mr. Beast, Tyga, Pauly D in charge of supplying the restaurants with the packaging bags wrappers etc with their name and logo on the bags or does the ghost kitchen have to pay to get the packaging made?
Is there one in Arizona
Man, shame i won’t be able to eat this anytime soon.         Europe gang where? Eh?
Yeah mr beast said that
don't you mean food facts
plz make a theory about dad's FOOD
soooo, when's Mr beast gonna expand to the UK? that burger looks too good.
Someone needs to convince Babish to do this but with an ever changing menu based on viewer voting.
2021: 50
It should have been called beast burger
Genius
Snipers Subways
I’m glad I watched this
about the legendary mrbeast.
As soon as he said "Delivering The Food" i got an ad for grubhub XD
I feel like the government is going to come and shut you for saying this
There's no mr beast burger near me :'(
I actually tried ordering one here in Columbus while watching this video and, while the food prices themselves are quire reasonable, the price is a bit absurd. For the food, $11 for fries, a burger, and soda isn't too bad, even with $1.80 in taxes added on to that (because Ohio taxes everything, exuberantly). But then its 4.99 for delivery and $2 for a 'service fee', which I initially thought was a gratuity but no - after you place the order it asks you how much you would like to tip. So, $11 for the food, $1.80 in taxes, $7 in fees, and the deliverer's tip (since I have a soul), came to a total of about $22.  I wish I could tell you if it was worth it, but I just backed out and uninstalled the app at that point, because that is too much for me.
Except I can’t get it 😡😡🤬🤬
I just realized that there are no links to MrBeast's original video. Its fine with me, but I think a lot of people are gonna get pretty mad over this.
I used to always go to Bravo
Speaking of FOOD, have you seen DAD's video about you???
how do u not draw suspicion that you just robbed a bank after a restruant hands you a wad of cash to put in the passenger seat? lol
try counting how many times MatPat says "pretty much" and other words in that tone
Check the dad channel now matpat!!!!!
Good video!
hey mat pat is a waffle a pancake
He has to do a theory about the grubhub ad at some point
Someone hasn't been reading the reviews of his restaurant, it's not doing the best
Im guessing tech theory for the next quadrant.
Matpat I got a thoery envoling sponge and Patrick eating the triple gooberberry sunrise in the first spongebob movie. I wonder How much of the triple gooberberry sunrise did they eat to get drunk and pass out
I mesebe  no
I’m just surprised he can say Buca di Beppo without slipping up.
So in short, the real people we should be commending is that restauranteur guy and his son.
I didn't think I'd need it, but now I want a Babish Culinary Universe and Food Theory crossover episode.
hate to admit it but, hes a GENIUS
Absolutely genuis
Mr beast is 5 head
Hey MatPat, I got a theory idea for you; In the classic sitcom 'Green Acres' Lisa Douglass is infamous for her terrible hot cakes. How about an experiment to find out why lisa's hot cakes are so terrible, or how to replicate them in real life?
im asking if i can go because im in texas
yea
lets take a moment to honor this editing
What I learned from this video the trendy the topic the more views 😉
So smart 🤓
Theory Idea: Is ketchup an energy drink? It does seem to meet the requirements of what an energy drink is on google. Would that make foods that go with ketchup (like potato based foods) sports snakes? I mean fries count as sports snack so it wouldn't be too weird. Apparently it could also be a smoothie or a jam. Which is it?
is it bad i knew all this
As soon as there was 342 in n out
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I'm happy this isn't one of those videos that try to make it seem bad
Eu sou do Brasil! Olha pra mim!  PS:You don't wanna come to Brazil (believe me
That glasses on his face tho.
if this syco path does a theory on ww84 i will die
I learned more here than I have in school, maybe because I'm skipping school to watch this.🙂
its closed on doordash;/
So what would happen when the pandemic starts to subside, restaurants start having walk-in customers and the orders start piling up? If the restaurant has too many orders from both their own brand as well as from the virtual brands, will they be prioritizing their own chain? Would they be hiring more people or expand the business by opening more restaurants? Would they start to break their contract with the virtual restaurants?
Wait he has a restaurant?
Isn't this game theory?
Ok
A play mobile ad came on at the start and I was like " GRINDING PLAY MOBILE TOYS AND MAKING BURGERS OUT OF EM !!!" Look what Matpat has done to me. Not complaining tho.
there’s a location 5 minutes away from my house :D
H
I simply love how inovative the world can be sometimes
Now I want mr beast burger
European fans: Man, i'd love to try that! American fans: We get the first try! haha!!
I think the free restaurant video is just an ad for his new restaurant
so he single handedly opened 300 places while all fast food restaurants like mcdonalds and kfc took them decades  like how?
Lol I got the Mr. Beast Honey ad before this video started
Hey Food Theory. My Birthday Is Soon And I Need To Know By Science Which Is Better? Ice Cream In A Bigger Container, Ice Cream In A Smaller One Or Packaged Ice Cream. I Need The Tastiest Cost Effective Way To Buy Ice Cream. Can You Help? Even If Its Just A Reply.
Well I guess that's at least one good thing to have come out of this phony pandemic.  Don't know if it exactly makes up for having a rigged election though. The bad still outweighs good.
Yeah, when is Mrbeast gonna get his 50 mil plat though
This theory made me hungry...
Sick 1 day ago imagine MrBeast(Jimmy) Reply’s to my comment I would tell my whole family and flex on my friends lel
The only problem with fnaf irl locations is you need the mind control disk thingies
Dang, he didn’t just beat the YouTube algorithm, he even beat the fast food algorithm!
6:21 GRUBHUB
Matpat exposing mr beast
When's Mat going to cover Grubhub?
You should probably just stick to Dads food
No not the only noooooo
Imagine making food so bad that you have to pay people to eat them
i like how the guy is like: WHAT! is dis? Mr Beast Burger?!?!?!?!?! 10:26
THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT MATPAT SAID BUCA DI BEPPO IN THIS VIDEO
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm1J--Cww1U&list=UUIfqlxlpNBlaY3FYvSjXI_A&index=1
I like the part when he said ‘ BUCA DI BEPPO’
Fuhnaff :[
The problem in this model is quality control .
wow.. Now that I saw food I want to eat XD
Guys don’t miss out check out Bee Network in the app store it’s a crypto that is currently free to mine for a temporary time.Join and use referral code: z3ro0 to get 1 free Bee crypto!!!

There’s not even an in n out where I live

It is real
the beast is gonna have mcdonalds soon
My workplace Smokey Bones is becoming a ghost kitchen for a brand called 'the wing experience', which is a sister brand that they're using to try and corner the drunk late night delivery market with 50 types of wing/sauce combos. Though in reality they're all still the same terrible wings.
I like the name Buca di Beppo hehe     *buca dE bepoOoo*   *buca de beppo*   *buca de beppo 😻*
Any Indians?
It’s like ghost writers in rap music, but in the cooking world
This episode food theory is great! Good job MatPat
me before watching: I swear matpat you better not ruin mr beast for me
people who dont watch food theory have to suffer plagerism on the likes of Mirror and Buzzfeed. legit saw this article yesterday with exact examples.......
I JUST NOTICED ANIMETPAT AND ANIMESTEPH GETTING GROCERIES IN THE BACKGROUND that's the coolest thing I've seen this year :P
This man is literally dropshiping burgers 😂
4:50 *OHNO NOT GRUBHUB OHNONONONONONO*
technically it is wat u think it is
Me waiting for mat pat to eat one
Mrbeast is also creating a mrbeast chocolate bar ;)
The amount of buca de beppo is insane what even is it. (Also it’s so much fun to say lol)
America: mrbeast  Other places including where I live: missing out
When are we gonna see a digital Freddy’s Fazbear restaurant?
Poyo Poyo Poyo
3.6k people didn't even see the video.
Why does this channel exist
Cause' FNAF makes it into each and every video.
in my town and city there is almost no one getting the virus so we can go to restoraunts and still 2 to 3 moths later no one even caught it
If Twitter can do whatever they want then all these closed businesses should be able to open
This channel is embarrassing
Its Free Advertisment.
There is a mister beast at my city but im still waiting for free burgers to go try it
Shut
0:15 but their free
LMAOOO Jimmy smart asf
Mr. beast do one in Petoskey I beg of you we don’t even have a mall
Shut up dude, come on
Mr.beast started a restaurant to money launder ,for better taxes
Jimmy isn’t money hungry like those fast food stores that’s the biggest difference
It's on Philippines
I love jollibee
hes not just a youtuber hes a great buisnessman
Its not that its very bad, you are just trying to soupport food chains that cant keep up. i still love ur content man!
Hi
E
"Thanks for dining at Mr Beast's burger!"  *Some people here owe me money*
The resolute spear laparoscopically whistle because piano analytically exist barring a sophisticated umbrella. striped, naughty algeria
So it means that when the pandemic is over MrBeastBurgers will dissapear..?
Cool
Worst burger ive ever had
Am I the only one who thinks the eyes are somewhat creepy...?-
ORDER MrBeast Burger now!
Bruh those were 1$ bills he gave that guy 😂
I hate you food theory. you ruin my favorite foods for me.
Food theory idea: what constitutes a cookie? What about animal crackers? And how are they different from tea biscuits? And what in the world is a ginger snap?
Real
He not fake
please buy a new stock image guy to use (10:35) im fucking sick of this guy please
Legit watched this in the bucatini de beppo waiting room
While you were talking about the restaurants closing, I thought of 2019 and got sad
Wow mrbeast is smart
Bro you’re just jealous stop
Mr beast
Say "Buca di Beppo" fast three times.
I ate the burger and it was good
You should make a fast food restaurant 2
petition to actually make candy's burgers and fries   what do you mean we can't
What?
i think mr beast is the protagonist of this anime called earth
When you don’t live in the US so you can’t get a MrBeast Burger: ;-;
I. Living. In. USA
SHUT UP I HATE YOU I LOVE MRBEAST
MrBeast's burgers are awesome.
I do notbeleve you P
How long until I can order a Krabby Patty, a Krusty Burger with a side of Lembas Bread and a squishee to wash it down?
Be nice to MRBEST
Yay! It's mrbeast   ps. #food theory why you insult him?!
Stay
International???
Hehehehehehehe
How mind bogglingly wealthy is Mr. Beast that giving away an ISLAND, cars or $1,000,000 is nothing more than chump change for him? I'm asking because I don't watch him (and honestly have no interest to) and genuinely don't know how you could do all the stunts he does (I presume) once a week and still make money hand over fist.
Wha-
Others: yay free money Me: Did anyone realize that what he was doing could lead to inflation?
Bruh if you been on TikTok lately you never look at matpat the same why again 😭🤚
Make a theory about cooking shooking
Mr.Beast strategy for money is genius but what he does with his fortune is very noble. Truly inspiring
Niko Omilano did it first.
And where is our Pat's Pizza?
Pls make it International so that I can tell my parents to Buy Me  Mr. Beast burger Here in the Philippines everytime they go on a 2 hour trip
that's pretty much what he said, but shorter
Lol
i got the chris burger and it was one of the best burgers ive ever had in my life
Best Lifetime when we have so many great youtubers
I'm tempted to order. However, the app only had a 3.2 review because apparently the app is extremely buggy and takes an incredibly long time to receive the order.
Wiz Khalifa has a food delivery service as well
Question for a possible video, why do we put a cherry on top?
how is this channel NOT verified yet?
👍
Grubhub meme 😏 https://youtu.be/Mvh0MvS2P34
15 seconds in video what a waste of money when it's for free
dang
I got an ad in the middle of the video  about a food delivery service🤣
Wait what a waste of money he gives them out for free though...
Something told me MrBeast would comment lol
But how do they keep the taste of the restaurant if it's cooked by possible different restaurants with different seasonings and stuff?
In MN it's the golden corral buffet that makes them. For the price of a buffet the same place will make a burger. No thanks.
There is one big thing that separates them MatPat. People who cant afford delivery. Delivery costs money that many people cant just go and spend money on for food. Especially if they're on foodstamps or very tight budgets. Ive never had food delivered because I cant afford to.
Your fake gugu
Just realized, this guy kind of sounds like Hoovie from hoovies garage-tell me I'm wrong lol 😆
This whole thing reminds me of a paper town, when a author makes up a name of a town in their book and based loosely off the location these cities become baby towns (ghost lands) due to so many people wanting to visit it. This is just a more real and modern version
Lo I thought this was a fake hate video providing false evidence that proves the other POV! Thank goodness it’s not
The right sycamore histopathologically fold because jar spontaneously attend before a remarkable sail. cut, lying thomas
day 1 of trying to make food theory do a theory on the addictive effects of caffine/why people prefer diet coke and regular Pepsi over diet Pepsi and regular coke.
Wait so he’s saving some restaurants by giving him business???
I don’t live in America and I legit thought MatPat made up the name Buca de Bepo it sounded so random!
So mrbeast is basically drop shipping with burgers
MrBeast if you are coming to India  please don't go to any trash burger  companies cuz there's a lot of trash ones and literally no good. So I don't think your plan to go to random ghost kitchens are gonna work.
wait, its ± what my sister do for the past month of covid, wxcept we only had one place
Can you do a indian mr beast burger openin india now
Cause he’s rich
This dude is such a douche i really dont understand why hes so popular but hey good for him.
I had a mr beast burger the chandler kind. I LOVED IT
Remember When ReviewBruh Reviewd The Beast Burger And That Day **Mr Beast Almost Tasted Death But Survived On The Very TIP**
Can you do a video about the controversy if cereal is a soup??? Your sandwich one was so good and the controversy on if cereal is a soup is another burning question!!!
Thats a lot of editing ngl
Theorist burger when?
I’m getting Monster Donut vibes...
Review cocaine in Coca Cola
Youtube should make a new tube called chewtube where it's like chewTube but for food
Beast
Your bad from Mr neast
wow, hope Alaska gets a MrBeast Byrger someday😊
Hello there
My state doesn’t have one, not ONE
lmao
I cant get any of the food because West Virginia lives in 1960 and has none of the modern amenities. Doordash? Grubhub? Ubereats? Doesnt exist here. And if it does you have to drive hours to get it but other restaurants that are better exist there!
8:36 - don’t have stock footage of a store closing? Just reverse an opening clip!
Woah. I thought I already watched 10 minutes of video but as I checked, I'm still at 3 minutes?
A guy singlehandedly rise the economy.
Matpat just called out the Bravo near me
4:30 double iconic glasses
I had my first mr beast burger meal just a couple days ago, and it was delicious. Totally recommend, the fries are great and the burger was hearty
The m.c. beast is a perfect name
The amount of money I wish I got into this business and basically rent my restaurant to these company’s 💵💵💵💸💸💸💰💰
This really doesn’t surprise me at first I thought once the hype was over mrbeast would shut it down and sell all buildings which would become ghost building or sprit Halloweens,but this makes way more since than that
2:47: 🥺
Me: *eats hamburger* Also me: *with fries* Part of vid: roblox ver of 🥺
We need that review on FOOD mat....
^_^
Has anyone tried the food yet? I see it on my Door Dash app but haven’t tried to order.
I find it really hypocritical that the dude who started #TeamTrees is now participating in the beef industry. Beef production is the largest cause of deforestation in the world.
Ur just gonna do him like that
plot twist: matt makes this vid just so mrbeast recognizes him
So I guess this business model assumes covid 19 lock downs forever. Lovely.
Hey howd you know i was a ghoul can i feast on ur heart? There my favourite
https://youtu.be/J1r63brfgks  my newest video, hope y’all enjoy :)
I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE A GHOST RESTAURANT!
I haven't had much luck ordering from ghost restaurants, the food has been quite poor in quality.
Don’t click on me
Mcdonalds are gonna have Mr.Beast clapped!!!!
Are we gonna talk about how fast Matt Patt says “Buca Di Beppo”
Lmao I’m still triggered by how he pronounces “Pasqually” wrong
Ok business idea this with cloths and merch
I have never heard of any of those places. Of the celebs, I have heard of Maria, but not the other two. Small town in the sticks does not have any of this.
I only still live in the US so I can get MrBeast Burger.     Nah just kidding God bless America🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
I've heard of Mr. Beast but I didn't know how stupid he was when spending money 😥
That Travis Scott DLC skin at McDonalds tho...worth the season pass!!!
I already new this
Man this guys videos are always over 10 minutes
if only he added gluten free options
knowledge
why is there none in oklahoma :(
Sounds like it kinda sucks for the staff tbh. Having to prepare multiple menus and not getting a tipout cuz it all goes to the driver. Super interesting though.
How is this 36 on trendinh
I hope they build a mr beast burger in Massachusetts lol
Did you just say Guys and Ghouls huh😐 monster high reference
6:42 This list of restaurants is brought to you by the letter B
This youtuber is so professional. Tone of the voice, editing, topic; everything on point to result in an entertaining and attention-holding video.
MrBeast is cool sub to him
booo!  food theory u are just jealous
I subscribed to mrbeast
the cake....is a lie...
i think this channel should have been called "Food Fact"
Still waiting for the Food Wars! Shokugeki no Soma theory
So basically catering 🤔
I actually found it out from a twitter post 2 months ago lol
I got the chicken burger not gonna lie pickles where da best part and it’s SUPER GOOD chicken burgers
It ain’t much, but it’s honest work
It’s a real shame that chain closed its only location in my city. I work Doordash in Oklahoma City and we maybe left in cold on this trend so far but it’s not from people not using the food delivery services. Honestly I think the restaurant end is stuck under served when it comes to certain chains.
I thought he would talk about impossible burgers or something...
I can't find one in ohio everytime I search for one nothing pops up
mad respect for the fact this video is 11:11 long
I watched reviewbrah and it looked good and he said it’s good, your just spoiled and you don’t deserve food, people starve in this world and you say it’s bad
no
no
there a “location” near me so when i first heard i about it i thought i’d just go to the restaurant itself to avoid the delivery hassle and when i got there, it was a bucas and mrbeast, mariah carrey and tygas restaurants signs were all on the windows
1:31 chandler (the winner) achually had to return it because the taxes were to high, he posted a video but I forgot where
First Mark now Mr Beast?!
Burgers are cheesy as your jokes
I want a borger 🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
Do you hate him because he have more money  Just kidding
I knew it wasn't real when I looked it up on Google maps. there was absolutely nothing.
am i the only one that knew this?
I got a beast burger it was better than any food i have ever eaten
Is this part of the deal for the Christmas light judging
When all the ads are grubhub 🤔
Plot twist: Mr. Beast makes tons of money but spends it all and he used to be a millionare
I was not aware of the concept of virtual restaurants and ghost kitchens. I also wasn't aware that Mariah Carey sold cookies. While they look good, how would you rate her cookies on a scale of 0-10? What kind of cookies does she/her brand sell? For the record, this question is open for anyone to answer and is not targeted towards any specific individual.
Ordered Mr.Beast Burgers twice and Also had the Tyga Bytes. Both really good.
Okay
If I made a Hundred Million a year off YouTube I could be Richie Rich too.
did anyone notice in the menu Karl is spelled with a C ? (man Karl is triggered)
He doesn't make the burgers. THE BURGERS MAKE HIM...
its funny how he says buca di beppo
Why are you lie
Never knew it was a thing. Then again it's probably nowhere near me.
Please pin this
Wiz Khalifas restaurant chain does this aswell!
It’s just kind of sad, because yea it is efficient, but all the benefits of profits restaurants are being taken outside of the communities they are coming from. Which is how a lot do business operate, it is just sad to me, because a small restaurant that lives and breaths within its community has a role beyond selling food.
Felix if your watching this video, Pewdiepie pie Jimmy did it you should too
What happens after the lockdown ends and the ghost kitchens return to full capacity
Ghost kitchens are the ghost writers of food
Did you like your FOOD from dad?
So interesting...       assemble the army of bruhify profile pics
No one: Not a soul: Matpat: BUCA DI BEPPO
Mr beast is a drug dealer and that’s why he can afford to spend all that money and still have more and more
Any body noticed that a month before the mrbeast burger video uploaded,  people uploaded videos about how they went to mrbeast burger?
everyone lets just not buy them to TROLL  MrBeast and see what he reacts
nobody: Mrbeastburger strategy:yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Me an Italian that lives in Italy with no one doing this epic things: why must you hurt me in this way? (lol)
AHHHH a Ghost restaurateur. Well theory Gang it's time for another mystery 10-15 minuets of shenanigans Surprising contribution from Baby Pat and Skip the Cat Time to reveals why this Ghost restaurateur. Pulls mask off Gasp Robbert and Robbie earl So it was you who were behind these disappearing celebrity endorsed restaruants.
Yo 💀 the joke he made about buca di beppo, why a Mariahs Cooks and MrBeast Burger operating out of one close to me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥https://youtu.be/qtbWQZh4i7s
Matpat: this video is definitely not sponsored   Me: /doubt
The mystery of what mr beast bank is still a mystery
I like that mat pat put glasses on MrBeast even though he already has glasses
So I saw this video and knew nothing about Mr east burger prior to this and was like Ohno is mandatory going to tell me something else I like is also evil
I just looked it up on my uber eats app. and the delivery fee even though its from the same place isnt the same price. it was 6.99 for mr. beast and 7.99 for tyga. (I didnt check the others) its the same place!! wth!
My only problem with this is that it forces people to use the 3rd party delivery apps and they aren't well know for their treatment of their couriers.
People who bought food from the restaurant: Am I a joke to you
make a Food Theory’s American-Italian Goods i will order on the daily
its CLOUD KITCHEN CONCEPT!
how does it have over 8 locations in Massachusetts but Only 4 in NC
I love when matpat said what a waste of money   Mr.beast it was free
Macdonald’s = mr beast burger
This is a little off topic but, I recently made some hot chocolate and it turned out pretty bad!  The milk didn't mix right with the chocolate and the flavor wasn't the same as the first time I made it with a different type of milk. So I guess what I'm getting to is, is there a so called best way rather it be the (type of milk, or type of chocolate) to make hot chocolate, or should I just stick to that "add hot water" instruction that most of the chocolate packets have written on them?    I know this is a silly question but I just have to know!!
Don't click on this link ➡️https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
I uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh didn’t ask for this but k
Ummmmm
This is the answer to how Ghost kitchens can survive during and after COVID! Cost are lower in a ghost kitchen, but you still need a LOT of business to be profitable in a restaurant! Jimmy's incredible fan base has the potential to drive enough volume. I wish him HUGE success! But... and I have a BIG BUT... if the quality isn't good, people will not continue to order  when they figure out it's not Jimmy in the Kitchen. Genius concept! I hope it works long term. And by the way... this video is fantastic! Terrific information, very entertaining, fantastic production value!
but is the piraka rap an actual rap?
you should make a chain called theory food
He obviously extremely enjoyed saying Buca di Beppo
I like Mr beasts channel and restaurant
5:31 they're all at the same place (except PaulyD's I can't find that)
I thought the burger was fake just a meme But just like taniks And purple guy It always comes back to haunt me
Pat is a liar
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” - John 3:16❗️

Smart
Just wait. Soon their gonna prove that apple juice isn’t made of apples

For real Food Theory has been dropping so much knowledge that I can apply day to day 🥺👉👈❤

I THOUGHT BUCA DI BEPPO WAS JUST A JOKE NAME. OMG ITS REAL
Tyga, ugh stealyng my name much!!!
Do you know how hard it us too return a wrong order to a "ghost kitchen"? Neither do I but was really sad when my chicken sandwich came with pickles and mayonnaise that was specifically ordered without and then they forgot my Pepsi...
GRUBHUB
My address is literally a buca di Peppo
Hey! Swell Entertainment did a video on this two weeks ago. Go show her some love! https://youtu.be/kpYpdk8W1q0
The Travis Scott Burger's sworn enemy
Mr. krabs will clap you
His food is pure garbage.
Almost certain it’s Hardee’s. They are losing income and something like this would help. All the same ingredients
I didn't know what a "ghost kitchen" was until I read about this guy's burger joint.
Can you still get it?
‘What a wasted money’ It’s free
I had a feeling Mrbeast would comment here
BRUHIFY ARMY
Ghost kitchens exists. Here in Miami there are like 3 of them I know of and they sell the food of others, not their own. You can own a kitchen and reach out to restaurants and ask to sell their food. Of course there are legalities.
I think I will stick with my Pasqually's Pizza & Wings over any of these virtual dining concepts...
Wait is it still open or is it closed now
Wow. Did I Win ??
Definitely missed the PaulyD D.elivering T.he F.ootlong opportunity.
I ordered 1 mr beast burger and 1 chicken burger with fries and drinks It came with the mr beast burger without cheese, no chicken burger fries or drink. Mildly disappointed
interesting to hear as a delivery driver.
He said he doesn’t care about money he cares about content
BTW MatPat, I was also super excited to see your recent collab with Mr. Beast's Christmas lights video! Very cool! <3 Hope to see more collaborations in the future!

Mr beast burger review are bad. So, if the public don't like it then it will die.🤷🏿‍♀️
That’s what I thought was happening anyways lol
To put it in a nutshell: they are saving small restaurants by hiring them.
I have a friend who works at a Bravo/MBB/Wing Squad.  All operate the same kitchen staff and have little to no training on the new menus 😂
Can you please do a theory of mithzans new z eye thing? I'm not sure what to call it but I can't figure it out myself so I want to see if you can
The dark side of this is that restaurants will also make "ghost listings" on services like uber eats and postmates, which takes their original menu and splits it up, just to saturate the listings with more of their own. Hooters is one example, they now have hooters, hooties burger bar, and hooties bait and tackle, which mostly has the same items as the base hooter's, but now takes up 3 spots in your list, pushing out other restaurants with menus just as big, but with only one listing. There are other local restaurants near where I live around charlotte, NC that do this too. They have "cool" names like "mac to the future" which is a back to the future themed mac n cheese place, but it's just mac and cheese from a restaurant that already existed and sold mac and cheese, and the only "themed" part is the picture design. Their food is just regular food. I don't agree with this practice, I think it's just hogging the restaurant list and unfairly pushing out other restaurants.   It's the same method that ghost kitchens use to get in via the various delivery services, but in this case it's malicious. I don't have a suggestion on how to fix it, but I think it does need to be addressed.
I just had a Mr beast burger and it was as cold as if you were naked in antartica
I'm gonna make a whole burger in the replies
Do that's what DTF means 😂🤔🤔 aight no wonder why they never answered. Guess they weren't hungry.
HOW DID YOU POST THIS THE DAY I FIRST TRYED MRBEAST BURGER
You go all in on your experiments I was expecting you to just talk about people on the internet. Just amazing work
My dad used to work at a Buca. It tastes great.
matpat what are your thoughts that technoblade has more subscribers than food theory

It's a phantom resturaunt.
I've seen a lot of pictures of raw burgers (chicken too) its kinda concerning
9:55 dont u mean sister location
Hopefully vertical restaurants become more of a thing, so local restaurants can stay afloat.
The Green Burrito with Carl's Jr. are an example of a ghost kitchen. They don't have standing restaurants, but sell through Carl's Jr.
Mr. Beast should be his own SCP.
So the cheifs are like ghost writers thats all i got from this
I love all the easter eggs in the intro
Amazing, I love eating money with a side of burger
This made me google fast food chain establishment dates for some reason.. Today I learned that the A&W company is now over 100 years old.
Will this is theory a food theory
Mat pat trying to get that Mrbeast burger money
Mr beast’s latest video: 16M  Matpat: 1.6M  Mrbeast now: 23M  Matpat now: 2.3M
Let me guess.. who’s here from Mr beast’s bought 5 store video?
Are you kidding me? I have been waiting for Mr. Beast to do ANYTHING near me and I freaking miss him setting up basically one town over!?!?!  FFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU--------
It's called a commissary kitchen
Do Buffalo Wild Wings
DTF Delivering the food sound still sounds somewhat sexual xD
Can I please have some money
I still love mr beast 😍
I have just seen an advertisement for honey with mr.Beast in it, right before a video about Mr. Beasts restaurant.
The closest MrBeast burger is 9 hours from me
BEST VID I EVER WATCHED LIKE MY 2 FAVORITE PEOPLE MATPAT AND JIMMY (oml i forgot plus Stephanie) :D
buca Di Beppo
Tbh tyga did it first
It’s just edible merch.
Food theory Virtual Resturant?
Genius.
Matpat could spend  money   and convince me that it was the dog
I feel like I just learned some cool factoid that I get to tell everyone I see.
That's such a big brain busniess model ngl
MrBeast 50 M PlayButton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swzk832PDeY&t=89s&ab_channel=kawaiiflowerbae
Mmmm the fresh taste of matpat ruining mrbeasts career as Gordon Ramsey, truly matpat is a work of art
Bring it to India voooo
Ill bet you that next food theory will be a food theory restaurant
That really is a genius idea and patriotic, and beyond, imo  I think that you'd already need a lot of money to have executed it like this though! Saving jobs with very little initial cost
I feel like Matpat just used Buca Di Beppa cause he likes to say it 😂
I have no idea who MrBeast is, he just seems to appear out of nowhere
"Cucina Italiana", if you don't know, stands for "Italian Kitchen"
Literally 99% won’t see this but I lost my job due to covid. They shut down all the restaurants in Cook county which then led me to losing my apartment. I'm currently living out of my car which I try and make the best of. I've applied to a bunch of places I'm hoping to get a call back. if anyone could help me with whatever you could bc I'm needing stuff like hand warmers which I stuff my clothes at night when it's cold. Also cheap burgers/fastfood. I know times are tough for everyone these days but if you're able to help me I have paypal username pay2winlife  If you're unable to help I totally understand  God bless you stay safe🙏
I legit just learned something. I knew that mrbeast was a virtual kitchen but didn't know half this extra info.
NICE
The location in Bryan texas is a dirty old gas station that had horrible food to begin with. Google mr beast burger in Bryan texas and get a street view of the location. Sad. It wouldn’t let me post this directly to me beast comment
No
This guy has the keysss
Yo
my town simply doesn't have uber eats or delivery for any restaurant besides pizza hut and papa johns
In terms of the economics of ghost kitchens; I do agree that they have been extremely successful and have filled a niche of the current market-- however as an industry trends professional of over a decade disagree about the long-term potential. They will succeed as long as restaurant groups such as the one's depicted are operating without indoor dining and with a skeleton staff, simply because they need some avenue of income to cover operating costs. However, once the pandemic has finally been contained, consumer demand will 100% shift back to in-store dining for factors of nostalgia and social interaction. Now, the one thing you briefly mentioned are TRUE remote ghost kitchens, i.e brick and mortar specifically designed as takeout food hubs. These I believe will outlast their co-op counterparts (who will in turn lose this vertical of income), and will change the delivery market long term.
New channel idea. Meme theory
Does it bother anyone that at 8:35 it literally says "Close" instead of "Closed"
Nothing delivers here  in nc TwT

it's things like this that give me renewed faith in capitalism
I suddenly got an urge to eat Mrbeast burger.
He’s a famous YouTuber that’s how
I love the use of the New Super Mario Bros. “New” for that section because just like the game, it wasn’t really new
Hey, I'm from Pennsylvania. I love it when we get a shout out.
Those ghost restaurants are like Sephora, celebrity put their name on some makeup (food) so people gonna buy it
I'm sad that the auto-generated captions aren't available now :( I'm kinda deaf and I don't understand some words that Americans say unless I see it
This is actually a really smart idea
It's like the merch but you can eat it.
Need to order one when I can
Burger
Matpat you should do a food theory on FOOD!!  What is FOOD actually that dad eats.  Your film theory had me interesting so I watch all of act I,II,&III.  Glad to see that you are a REAL HUMAN DAD!!!!!  😉😉
its kinda weird how he do it at the end of 2020 just why not in middle of 2020 soo people can get free food
how he made 300 restaurants in one day. Simple. He is famous on Youtube
Brilliant idea. Everyone wins.
Yeah its nice and all but its stupid when theres no Beast Burgers near you kekW
you knowwww... if we made real fnaf restaraunts we could make 2 sets of the fnaf 1 animatronics and the first set stays in the restaraunt and we could send the 2nd set out to deliver! i got the idea from fnaf ar.
Mat is food in Swedish so your name is foodpat
Some people really have completely different YouTubes. I've never even seen a Mr Beast video so much as suggested. At this point I'm not convinced he isn't some character Mat Pat made up.
idk who Mr. Beast is. But I like what he's doing. So I thought I'd support and buy from him. But it looks like Mr. Beast Burger isn't in my area. ;- ;
they saying that so he has a lot of views
Hey I just subscribed please give me free meals when you open your restaurant 😋
Juicey burgers
Imagine how many Uber eats ads I got throughout this video lmao
Imagine how many Uber eats ads I got throughout this video lmao
Imagine how many Uber eats ads I got throughout this video lmao
He invited you one time  and got a shoutout from him and now you are just hating or everything are you doing here that i dont know how to explain
Mr.  Beast should run for President.
he should do something about hot wings
Gotta wait until mrbeast burger aren't just in the US so It can make it to the phillipines cuz I live there
"what a waste of money" - the person who got a free burger
Mr beast might be the first YouTube Ponzi scheme
Meu canal só tem 25 inscritos me deem uma força bjo
"boogadibepop" love that lmao
YAY
isnt sister location a sister brand
bai, i rlly o not like it when u do this
THIS HAS GONE TOO FAR, you did it to markiplier, so i let it slide but this has gone too far, these are real ppl that ur doing theorys on
https://youtu.be/bs3ikTAptwM This is my video and i will say agar bade bade youtuber ko support karoge tum log toh unhe thoda sa farak padega kyuki ab unke liye ye daily ka hai lekin aagar kisi chhote supporter ko karoge toh wo uske liye bahut badi baat hai bs mere ko hi nhi sbko karo chahe uske 0 hi subs kyu na ho it doesn't over content 🙏
jimmy is such a fucking legend. he's so genius, i know he isn't the first to do this but still. he's so powerful.
It's as real as Markiplier is
I'm from Bazil, I can't give money do MrBeast :(
Check out the name of this restaurant at this location 104 Torrey St, Brockton, MA 0230....I am on to you FOOD THEORIST!
Mr. Beast: I got unlimited money in less than 5 years.
"What a waste of money"  Wait?? You buy itt!!!????
Cool
Can't order. Like all the other projects by Mr Beast, this is America Only... Imagine the world being bigger than just the U.S. ...
Haters
Mat: what a waste of money  Jimmy: wait,what say it again?
As someone who cant afford the extra delivery fee (I could count on 1 hand how many times I have had food delivered to me in my whole life on one hand) I still will go to the place and pick up my own food so delivery only is still a pointless ad for me.
Dang ,to hear a burger came out of a ghost kitchen.
My theory was that he just bought a bunch of local restaurants that were closing down because of covid, that way he could buy them much cheaper and since he was just starting out, it's not like a major chain buying them because he wouldn't have to worry about there being another Mr beast burger nearby thereby not actually reaching any more customers. But yeah, this does make a lot of sense. The only issue I guess would be if people then expect to dine in when the world is back to normal and can't because it's actually another restaurant
This theory just makes me think of how many small local businesses this type of business hurts.  The small mom & pop burger shop like the one a few miles from me has exactly one location.  They were already on the back foot competing with the big mega chains.  But do you know who donated more money & time to local causes like parks and recreational facilities for kids?  Those mom & pop shops by a wide margin.  Now perhaps that’s anecdotal, your local mom & pop shop could be run by a pair of old misers who take every dime they earn from you and spend it in Cabo.  But statically small mom & pop shops have a higher rates of income being redistributed locally.  It’s been a while since I looked this stuff up, but a few years ago it was something like for every dollar you spend at local business 80-90% of of which stayed local in the form of wages for employees, and other production costs.  With big Mega Chains that number drops to something closer to 20%.  This new virtual location scheme seems intended to drop that value of money spent staying in the local area as close to zero as possible.  I don’t have the numbers here to compare, but I’d wager for every Maria Cookie you’re buying, the grinch’s share of that cost is getting shipped out of state.  But it’s not like we live in a society where the vast majority of money is increasingly controlled by a smaller and smaller minority of people while the average person is fighting harder and harder for a smaller and smaller piece of what’s left...
It's a shame that the calories on that menu are not virtual
Nice insight.
Wish fnaf would just die out.
MrBeast wants to know your location
FNAF sister brand? Makes sense, he already made FNAF sister location
Shame on MrBeast for spamming Youtube with your obnoxious ads. It was one thing that they were already annoying, but now they are constantly the exact same ad.
Where can I order one? 👀
Before you know it, this guy's gonna buy Disney or something.
Is he still giving the monies?
Going to leave advice since  it's rare. Always ask "is your decision worth it?"
Matt you going to hate this one maybe. Diet Coke really the healthier soda option?
Does It Ship Internationally
Same goes for the YouTuber coffee brands, like Top of the Mornin'.
Does this concept of virtual/ghost restaurants feels all of a sudden a normal thing now just because it is a pandemic? Weird how our brains can get used to it so quick.
Sister brand? SISTER LOCATION!

When you said you wanna open your own restaurant I was thinking you could make your dreams come true, you could open a fnaf themed restaurant and all the games there would ether be a fnaf game or one of the mini arcade games based off of older games. The mini arcade games could be in the party rooms that cost a little extra. or you could do a mini arcade! hope you like my idea! I started as a game theory fan and now I'm here.
actually, that is exactly what I thought it was.
I had a burger from their all I have to say is McDonald’s step it up
I wanna try those food
Me who lives in an American territory which isn’t near america: i wanna try :’ )
Mr beast please go international! I’ve been a fan of yours for everlasting years now but I live all the way in australia and will never be able to meet you, getting to experience a mr beast burger would be amazing!
So basically there’s a guy named Robert Earl who owns a bunch of Italian restaurants, and sells food with a celebrity name in front of it from those during the pandemic, cool
This also explains the "sponsored youtuber meals" available from Uber only.
Being from pensilvania I appreciate knowing that there are mrbeast burgers are near me
https://youtu.be/2lCiVGBkgwM
5:07 omg matpat we are too young for that reference you should know this by now.
Is a pop tart a cookie?
Failed opportunity to be sponsored by Hellofresh, a similar concept that also sponsors many other youtubers
Love ya Matpat!
Everyone except the people who lose everything because they weren't essential enough to the demtards
This is honestly an amazing idea, not only is it a crazy good idea for celebrities that want to make a food chain and big existing food chains that want to stay afloat, but if there was a way to tie in small restaurant chains? and local restaurants? You could evolve the market and keep restaurants, big and small alive and not closing down. This is a tactic to keep the food economy afloat,
So he set a restaurant for a fay, created huge hype so everyone sees it, then closes doors and goes online?  That's actually really smart marketing because many people might actually think that they have own restaurants and own kitchens as they have seen "The first one launch".
This is irrelevant but they should make a Space Theory channel
Awww man but what if I want some banging burgers and sweet tasty cookies, I'm gonna have to make two order :(
We want an international one
So basically restaurants are dealing with the pandemic by expanding their menus to items outside their 'brand' by using celebrity tie-ins.  Are you a struggling Italian restaurant? Partner with a successful Youtuber and sell burgers and Italian food.
i googled mr beast burger seattle wa and seen a address so i copied and pasted it to google and the restaurant that came up was bucca di beppo italian
one thing that would be better for the employees would be a raise. For carryout workers, doordash and other delivery services have taken over 50% of the tips the employees of the restaurants make. For doing double or triple the work with no raise and less in tips. if you order doordash the restaurant employees get $0 for doing 90% of the work. (just not the driving part). good business move but, it'll cause very unhappy employees.
Nothing you do is real. Who thinks it is? It's the internet so I'm sure there's a few that think so but It's so funny how fake everything is
I've delivered for skip the dishes for almost 3 years now, on an off casually. Only time I've seen a ghost kitchen was at a few small "mom and pop" Chinese food places that ran 12 different Chinese food restaurants that existed only for online orders out of one kitchen with one set of staff/chefs.
virtual restraunts while a good idea for the companies themselves, once people catch on, they wont order it. I got excited  for a new Nashville hot chicken place in town, only to find out its literally just claim jumpers. You can drop ingredients in an existing restaurant as a ghost kitchen, but you arent gonna get the quality of product that you can control owning the restraunt yourself.
I got food poisoning from the chicken sandwich
To get 1 Chris style burger and 1 fry it cost in total $23. It tasted pretty good but I still think it isn’t worth the price. This is my honest review. Btw: No hate I love MrBeast
This is how I should launch my business 👌

I live in New Mexico and going out side at night in New Mexico is asking to die, and no one that knows why would want to come here, so does Mr beast burger deliver here?
They may stay but i dont think they will replace anything. Some places may all have double cheese burgers but those burgers all have different taste to them. These kitchens arent gonna carry mcdonalds, burger king, carls jr, wendys, in nout, and jack in the box pattys.
Please make a “was total recall a dream or not”
To the person reading this Jesus loves you and he want you to be in heaven with him so today I ask will you commit to live a life in Christ it’s the best decision anyone could ever make and today is your chance to don’t take down this opportunity and get saved today don’t be left behind so watch this video below and listen to it have a great day https://youtu.be/5FKl7Ie1axQ

MrBeast for President!!!!
That’s actually a whole other level of genius
I 👍 just for that intro
Is it just me or does Buca di Beppo sound so satisfying coming from matpat
Is this bad or good
This is why fast food companies are subbed to this channel, they want to learn better strats
Mr Beast burger is better than mcdonald
It is it’s ok doordash
"The phantom of the Opera is now eating fries"
🤣🤣 the dtf joke got me, good show. this is my first time watching this channel been a fan of game theory for years.
Mr. Beast is a genius because I said so
So MatPat is merely planting the seeds for Scott to franchise the FNAF food at ghost kitchens in return for the help with the St. jude live stream. I see what you did there.
Simply explained and incredibly informative; thank you so much! Great job :D
I'm just waiting for the day MrBeast to win young american of the year, (i hope they have that in america, its in australia tho) He's done so much for his community!
When you realize that there is a mrs. Beast burger 😎😎 pig moment
I always save food theory videos for when I’m eating breakfast
New World Order trend as everything is moving into digital even our currency. Just you watch...
Trying to reply bugs out for some reason. Did I break something, or did I come across a rare bug? Sorry about the spam.
How awesome!!! I just wish there was one by me. Surprising, because it's very near a tourist attraction
Test comment. My comments have been acting up. Must be buggy connection.
I'm calling it right now, ghost restaurants are the future of fast food.  Even after the pandemic.  Maybe even all restaurants, eventually.  Dining out will be replaced by ordering out.  I can see how 10-15 years from now you will use apps to get all your restaurant food.  And it was all ushered in by this pandemic.  That's my prediction anyway.
That's fing brilliant.
https://youtu.be/9vSvG2b388g
every food theorist video title be like :  stop you're eating it wrong and its not even food
That's sus
Incredible
A failure of capitalism
*I would like to order MrBeast burger with Grubhub*
As someone who opened a business February2020  And you can imagine how that investment went This i quite interesting to hear but I wonder if we could do this in japan!
My brain is the slowest thing ever but the way you explained this makes so much sense
Awesome vid!   i watch all of the theory channel since some of them were still  in their early days.
What about social distancing measures in the kitchens themselves?
Matpat, anyone who watched the Chuck E Cheese video knows its not a real restaurant.  What really wouldve been like "Wow that wasnt what it thought" wouldve been "These restaurants are actually controlled by these people taking advantage by selling the food that the celebrities wanna sell, but without the skill of a restaurant owner"  Which I mean, I guess it kind of was framed that way. Just a lot more of the video focus was set on the restaurants not actually being real.
Your video doesn’t have subtitles...
07:46 that music is a banger!!! anyone know the name of the background song?
Buca di Beppo
Scary how everything is becoming virtual. They don’t want us out eating with our families, they want us alone in our homes never allowed to leave

Welcome to Good Burger the home of the Good Burger!
Ordered from mr.beast, never showed up, refused refund. Had to dispute with my  credit card company
https://youtu.be/w1Ld2SnUqWY
Of course MatPat being the nerd he is, has to start with saying restaurants that everyone knows, then say some restaurants that almost no one knows of, (if this comes out mean, and insulting, that was not indented, pls don’t be upset, or mad, you are an AMAZING YouTuber Mat.)
its free money bruh
Imagine a Fnaf game where about a ghost kitchen or one with a sister brand
But its free right
Sounds like Print on demand of food
https://youtu.be/d1ANmXGdhks🔥🎸
I can’t 😭
It really sucks that someone like this never comes around me
His restraunt is kinda hideous tho
Can you do a theory on what is in Coca Cola? It makes since for a theory because they have a secret formula. Fun fact: companies are required to put the ingredients of food and drinks on the packaging.
It was actually so good ngl
Why would I buy from a ghost resturent?  Is the food prepared deferentially? Using special recipe of something?
mrbeast commented on this vid no wayyyyyyyy
I have so much respect for this guy
Do one on FOOD and how delicious it is!   _Only $72!_
This is BRILLIANT

Me knowing "DTF" is probably a joke but also just not wanting to know what it is.
The oddasity you have Mr beast
I hate delivery apps like uber eats or just eats bc both multiple times didint deliver everything we ordered  Not long ago we had 4 boxes delivered from kfc on just eats and only 1 box came and they didint want to give a full refund -never use just eats-
This is a really interesting business model. First time hearing about this. I think this will pick up at other countries too!

2020 Election Fraud
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Now thats what video title i wanne see
It must have taken multiple times to say buca di beppo right in the script
Watching all that money and food in 4 am while hungry and broke is kinda depressing my dude
I'm an Aussie tho
My local Buca Di Beppo is now making Mr. Beast burger! They’re pretty good too
mr beast needs to fund his extravaganzas🤷🏽‍♂️
I live in Oregon and we don't have any mr beast burger restaurants which makes me sad
Xd
I yust like M burgers
Kinda fucked up how one guy can sign a contract and now hundreds of kitchens have to prepare different items with zero input from the actual workers
I read that Mr beast started using ghost kitchens in local business to help them cuz they were struggling from the pandemic. So you get an affordable meal while supporting your local businesses.
*grubhub*
we're already seeing the physical manifestation of this through things like "night market" events, and places like the Packing House, where you go and there's just a plethora of food places to eat. it's nice, but i don't think it should take over the experience of dining out.

Mrbeast burger will take over McDonalds
His burgers are free they don’t cost money you wrong I love mr beast
Love the vid
The point of this was to make money for charity, not for the taste. Obviously it’s not going to be a high quality burger, it wasn’t made by professional chefs.
Beast burger are good this vid sucks
Genius
No Freddy Pizzerias, thanks, I don't have a death wish.

You know as an accounting clerk, I look at those bundles of new $1 bills and I want to cry. New bills are the worst to work with and count. When ever I would open a bundle of new bills, I would take the time to alternate new-old-new-old into my smaller bundles before I gave change out to a cashier or bartender.
you should do a theory about grubhub's reverse psychology ads
That was my first thought lol it seems weird theres no restaurants
Wait this is not a theory tho it’s fact

Bro, I swear, bravo puts crack in their salads and pastas. It’s so freaking good and addicting and I can’t get enough of them.
Oi can you make anime theory please it would be so cool!
I find it sad that every bucca di beppo restaurants closed in tampa area years ago.  I didn't know they were still around
Kind of makes sense, closest location to me is in a vicinity of a buca di beppo  edit: looked up the address, it IS buca di beppo
Mr. Beast is a Genius👏🏾
My family and I DoorDash It's Just Wings weekly and we know it comes from Chili's. And we wonder why Chili's couldn't offer such value from their menu. But, I don't fault Just Wings. They're delicious.

Hello my sisters, hello my friends, I am from Syria and I need you to support and subscribe to my channel. Thank you very much
Was this a joke from mrbeast like "you should make a food theory about this" that matpat took litterally?
Epic periodT.
Aye mr beast commented
When i Saw the thumbnail i was About to RAGE. but i cooled off cuz its not a friggin dissapointment of a video.
This dude said “Mr. Beast” more times in this video than the real Mr. Beast has in all of his official videos combined. After a while here, I just could not listen to him say “Mr. Beast” one more friggin time. Had to bail out.
I want a borgor
Let's get that Food Theory restaurant Matt!!!
not sure if you would see this, but this "ghost restaurant" is not really safer, due to the fact you have no idea how "clean" these restaurants is, the platform don't verify the restaurant application, so technically you don't need a food safety paper to open a "restaurant" and circumvent all those paperwork. hopefully you can see  where were going with this, and if they get caught with dodgy food, its easier to make up a new name and send another application.
I'd try a matpat burger
Lame
Wait...this is a real new channel? And it has 2.18M subs? When??
A lot of people forgot that Mr.Beast isn't the one cooking and that he can make mistakes too.
Have them once they were very good. The second time was shorted of a burger and of course it was mine. Still enjoyed the Mr Beast fries at least!
mr beast stop being smart

When’s your food theory on dads FOOD
can you support my channel
This is actually a genius idea that I haven't realized and I usually consider myself capable of picking up on "new age internet" business ideas. **am I getting old?**  You missed one additional benefit of virtual restaurants. They don't need to be at a prominent location, they could be anywhere. The restaurant locations usually require such high rents but you wouldn't need to pay that much with virtual restaurants. Furthermore, you could open more restaurants to shorten the delivery time instead of tying up a massive area to one restaurant.
*When will we Get a real life Freddy fazbear’s pizza place?*
It's just good economics. You have surplus food production and someone who can create a demand. Keeps workers employed and gets people burgers.
Matpat: EVERYTHING IS FAKE
i think matpat is jealous
seems like a good idea but also sounds really, really expensive for consumers
Ordered one of the burgers and it was raw at the location near me. Sad. Had a bad experience.

Stop being stupid
So a centralized kitchen with a decentralized menu.   Thats brilliant.
Cool but no one cares for where I live. Nair available in this city. Also no one delivers to my specific area.

Speaking of virtual kitchens, if you're in the greater Seattle/Tacoma area you should check out this AMAZING chicken sandwich virtual kitchen. Better than Chik-fil-a hands down! https://www.chkaboom.com
this video is dumb
Hey out of curiosity if a random citizen wanted to open a restaurant are you sayin a citizen can use these ghost kitchens to get a head start on it maybe possibly cheaper then opening a brick and mortar store and getting permits from local government and city officials
Ghost kitchens are nothing new though. My brother's been doing it for years...he just didn't have the NEARLY the same amount of faithful followers & therefore the instant marketing power. Btw, I tried it. Was SO excited, as I am one of those faithful followers & wished I could've given more positive reviews, but unfortunately the food was a fail for me. Sorry Mr beast, but it was terrible. We got a Chris burger, loaded fries, grilled cheese, & chix sandwich. Everything was soggy & cold by the time it arrives 40+mins later. Disappointed that nothing looked like it did in the mouthwatering pictures. Oh yeah, & the grilled cheese, which was made w/cheap sliced American chs., was flat as pancake.😂 No joke, I thought someone had stepped on it & squashed it. The chix wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special either. The only thing I did like was the cute BeastBurger sticker. I really had hoped for better :/
Mr beast is a genius is what I’m getting
I mean he's the kind of guy who buys money to get more money
In my old hometown!
Is this clickbait I see???

If you're reading this, stay strong, keep safe, and don't lose hope. Together we got through 2020 and we'll continue to face 2021's challenges with resilience. My respects and condolences to the families who've lost loved ones; stay strong. During these turbulent times there is still hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news: God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free.  If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a way maker If you need freedom or saving He's a prison-shaking Savior If you've got chains He's a chain breaker. Give all your burdens to him,  for he cares for you.  Its never too late in this life to put your trust in him. Let his grace come through. Above all, love one another and Forgive each other Just as God Loved and  Forgave you. Don't let your heart be troubled in these times.  I wish you the best day.

Fast food giants: let's have a talk.. *loads shotgun*

Lmao he is just making a bizzare theory though mr beast is just giving away free food and money to help people
99k likes wow
my dad got a mrbeast burger along with $1,000 and the burgers were a chefs kiss
For thoes who still don’t understand what a ghost kitchen is it’s kinda like a ghostwriter where they write the song and get no credit
I hope Matpat does a Food Theory on why packaged ramen is so cheap
Its beast burger it’s beast burger oh yeah
Make a FNAF delivery only ghost kitchen brand, but when your order gets close it opens the map for Special Delivery.
I dont care if its real ill never get this food
Am I the only person wondering what will happen to his business model after the pandemic when restaurants return to full capacity??
This man Mr Beast is a literal genius
the only thing which I'm wondering is how will they control the food quality and make sure they deliver the same product to every location? Might be a potential issue, what do you guys think?
never speak of 2020
https://www.instagram.com/pomsky_princess_arcadia/
haha food
I feel like this theory doesn’t touch enough on how these businesses will fare post-pandemic, when that kitchen needs to not only feed the delivery app customers but a full restaurant of patrons as well.
At chilis we do this with its just wings
I'm just here for MatPat to say "Buca di Beppo!"
Juste ta yeule
A burger joint that gives away cash??? What????
Scott adams actually talked about this at the beginning of a pandemic. Not the ghost part but restruant that are all kitchen no dinning becoming the norm

To be fair, In n out has really strict franchising allowances. Last I read, they only allow extended family to open a franchise
In N Out deserves more places
This title is..... Something
All fine and dandy if they actually deliver a good product. How can MrBeast (and others) control the quality of the product when there isn't really a "company" in the traditional sense for oversight. I tried Beast Burger and it was awful in my area. https://twitter.com/jd_sutter/status/1340931814961999872?s=19
Food theory. Cmon Mathew. The horse is cold and bruised
This thumb nail is photo shopped and you just probably hate him
When you said "FNAF IRL" I got very scared for a second, then I remembered safety violations and got very happy
2:30 that is the stupidest comparison ever. In and outs whole ideology is rarely opening locations of course its gonna have very litte locations. Why isnt compared to subyway which used to open hunderds of returants a day?
Eewwwww
Tbh Mr. Beast is  probably not trying to make money for Jimmy. Probably is just being used to give money to restaurants in need.

Behold- tax right offs. The web series
That;s nice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEqMjYsiwAE
The difference is I get cold food when I used to delivery service and I get hot food when I go pick it up myself .. if my food can make it to me hot I'd use it but nothing like waiting and being pissed off your burgers Stone Cold
i mean its free u dont waste money
4:40 the Matrix!!
This is the exact thing I earlier said check this out now globalagricsupply.com
I'm really upset about Mr. Beast Burger because the closest location is 2 ish hours away from my house, so obviously I can't get it delivered to me
In my town, a Famous Dave's combined with a local Granite City Food and Brewery. So, it's not just celebrity food chains.

Well his name is BEAST.
3 big things that go with doing this kind of "new virtual restaurant". 1. The employees have to be trained and able to make a new menu. 2. New equipment might be needed to make certain menu options. 3. That restaurant has to deal with inventory and supply of the new food.
mat pat you should make fnaf irl resurant
It's Just Wings does this in my city. They operate out of Chili's, deliver through DoorDash etc, but don't have any physical locations. They're good, too!
I haven’t even watched the video but I already know it’s gonna be good!

Makes sense now why everything on these apps are so bad
he puts you in rewind and the 300,000 mula. and now you do him like this
Please tell me MatPat broke out of his F.O.O.D trance with the MrBeast Burger.
Awh there isn’t a mr. Beast delivery in my city 😔 I can’t try it. I live in a super small city it is growing but it’s still small.
Hi every one I literally said MRBEAST for 6000 times straight.   Let’s show this video to the own #mrbeast thanks everybody 😊
We love your content!!! Please check out our channel! We’re a recently married lesbian couple who just moved to California !
We need a Fnaf style restaurant. change my mind.
Mr Beast always finding a different way to give money away. This time was pretty genius given the state of the world
This is nearly genius and could really change dining in the future
"such a waste of money!"      *Laughs in giving away MONY*
OMG I just realized the worst thing! I am not subscribed yet! 😭😭 gonna do it now!!
Mat i was so worried i thought you eated the FOOD i thought DAD had made you or something
The fact that Gen z kids think any of this YouTube stuff is real is... sad. I guess when they grow up they’ll realize it’s all make believe.
the amount of likes on this comment is the amount of times he said Buca DiBebos
Jimmy's manager said in an interview: "we have 0 ghost kitchens"...
When I first heard about this I assumed the prices for the food must be crazy high, since so many people take a cut, but when I checked Mrbeast Burgers menu, everything is actually pretty well priced, even a little under some other burger places nearby
PETITION FOR MATPAT TO OPEN A FREDDY FAZBEARS PIZZA IN THIS FORMAT WITH SCOTT
"what a waste of money" its freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
10:34 Now I want an IRL Freddy Fazbear's Pizza more than ever... When they get at your door they do their Special Delivery (joke intended of course) and maybe they'll even jumpscare you!  Just don't let two guys named William Afton and Henry Emily start the business, cause we all know how it'll end.
Mr beast isn’t getting stonks he is stonks
WOW
i still cant believe that mrbeast opened a resturant
Wait ‘’buca di beppo’’ is actually a real thing?
Let's all agree he's just the  smartest business savvy person ever
Me: gets Mr beast Honey ad while watching the video, and door dash video on the tv at the same time.
Scott needs to get on this. most like burgers, but i'll eat Chica Nuggets any day.

Hey brother follow me on tiktok https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJvY3RmK/
It's a shame that not all of the locations offer drive-thru cuz the one near me is delivery only so I'm unfortunately not about to pay $20 for two burgers the prices are a bit ridiculous especially since it's not their own food it comes from delivery apps so honestly not worth the hype although the money goes to charity so it's a good cause
The Wario Apparition dreams edition. https://youtu.be/DqozgvoHCVQ
TODAY I PUT BLEACH INSIDE OF MATPATS BURGER AND HE DIED (SOUND EFFECT)
I think everybody already knows this that's why you can only order it from the delivery apps
This is impressive !!
I thought this was a Mr. Beast Vid and spent days thinking “I watched that”.
it was a charity
I hv an idea for a channel! Perhaps, THE BOOOOKKK THEORY??!
That said, he also has an ingenious recipe for success on this platform doing it for good but also in ways so outrageous it’s everybody’s wild dream so he gets all the clicks and it’s never clickbait. “What goes around comes around”they say, although in his case it’s “what comes around goes around.”
Am the only one who hasn't heard of this until today?
It's a great idea to get more use out of the kitchens, my only worry would be if the virtual brands keeps squeezing the restaurants, pitting them against each other in a race to the bottom.  As always, if your main business depends from a single platform, you don't have a business. Diversify if possible, make sure you have an exit plan if not.
how long has this channel existed and why have i not known about it?
WAIT I THINK I LIVE RIGHT NEAR THAT EXACT PA  BRAVO-
And of course I can't get any in my area...
So I saw Mr Beast Burger on door dash a few days ago and I legitimately didn't know who he was. Good to learn all this
Hey matpat do a food theory video on diet coke
Poor Mr.Beast
They don’t even cook the burger

Mr Beast, seeing this title: 👁️👄👁️
I do love me some bravo
Health department concerns are closures would devastate all businesses out of the kitchen. Also unless you own the property or on like a standalone book of the depot, and only having to pay mortgage and taxes, and then taxes that's one thing, but many restaurants are in strip malls and only able to lease, and almost in every case at least is based not only upon square foot usage but also upon a percentage of retail sales and unless contracts are written in such a way that retail sales mean in store retail sales and not ghost kitchen retail sales restaurants will find themselves in the same bind they were in before the pandemic and even post.
This is a lie
Mr.Beast:I want to die with 0 dollars in my bank account His descendants:Am I a joke to you
awesome job thanks for helping those people losing their asses right now
I worry for the well-being of laborers anytime a business tries to maximize efficiency.  It sounds good to say, “we’re saving jobs” and that’s true, but its also true that businesses are not above overworking people for profit if they can.
Yes although it is true that the pandemic has tripled even quadrupled the ghost kitchen business, this reminder goes kitchen's been around for 8 years and I have different names I will say this: me b. Burger in fact the only first to be created without an actual location ever.  Mr bburger doesn't even actually itself count the pop-up you see at the beginning of the video
Valentine Stickers https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appmonk.satyendra.lovestickersforwhatsapp
Yes everyone gets a cut except the driver gets three four or five dollars for any amount of miles, and that's b*******
You could logically assume that because of the pandemic this is why ghost kitchens are springing up, sorry to disappoint but ghost kitchens have been up and about for about 8 years now.
I personally think that would be rad to not meet Mr beast and find him at a restaurant 🤣
After all the talk about Five Nights at Freddy's and playing the games as well, I wouldn't mind if there was an IRL Five Nights at Freddy's pizza parlor, like Chuck-E-Cheese. it would be cool to walk into the building and see all the real animatronics and themes from the games.
man this was fun to learn about and you gotta respect the hustle it really is genius
Sick vid but I need to know what the fourth channel is

Food and staff are operating expenses, not overhead...

Hey Mat, you and Ro should team up to make a ghost kitchen. You could have baked goods and Diet Coke combos for everyone to enjoy.
OK

I have an idea for the fourth theory channel. What do you think of the name “Music Theory”?
This is legitimately an amazing idea
Waste of money it’s free
It's not even "new restaurants". It's basically just this one big established italian restaurant company trying to get through the pandemic by resorting to selling random fast food that's packaged in branded containers.  I'm pretty sure not Tyga, not Mariah Carey, nor MrBeast came up with the menu. The italian restaurant guy probably had those ideas ready to go, they basically only needed someone to have a brand they could put on the food.
he has one more slot for ""somethink" theory" channel
wiz has one too! earls didnt waste a pandemic.
Umm matt pat those are not napkins😕 that’s money 🤑
Me with a bravo near my friends house  🤔

Mr.beast is the best
This makes sense
Do a theory on “don’t blink I’m human” search it up on YouTube it’s so messed up
Hold on you’re telling me I live in the town where his burgers were being made and I wasn’t even aware this was happening until today???
Uber's founder travis is doing the same thing with cloud kitchens
Bruh how is this a theory 😂😂
Buca de buca de buca de buca de buca de buca de buca de buca de beppo
Kitchen as a Service
I believe these businesses will crash when the vaccine gets rolled out. The restaurants will become more busy and it wont be efficient or cost effective to continue operating ghost kitchens.
Wait I live in North America can I get mrbeastburger
Can’t wait for theory burgers
Ok this is good and all but is this rlly a theory?

so dropshipping but food style 🧐
yeah mrbeast burgers are ughh
Confirmed, looked up my local "Mr. Beast Burger" yep, it is a Buca de Beppo
sometimes i forget that you post on all of the theory channels.... thank you! :)
rip small businesses that aren’t on this wave
I wonder what would happen if you walk into a restaurant like buca or bravo and order a beast burger. If they technically are the restaurant would they make it?
with my name being ghost i feel very swag when he said "guys and ghouls"
As a delivery driver, I was very confused when I first got an order for Mr beast burger and it took me to a buca di beppo
...
I find it ironic I got a grub hub ad while you were talking about virtual restaurants
I saw the mr beast video, and thought, "huh, i bet theres gonna be a food theory" and there it is

Never heard of it. What’s a Mr Beast? What’s a burger?
Chili's has a ghost kitchen called Just Wings
Dont worry mr.beast will go in dept not u
I thought everyone knows they're ghost kitchens?
His burgers are good and RICH
Guys dont worry! Not yours but mr.beast will lose his cash

Welcome to food theory restaurant where we discuss why you don't really want that eggplant Parmesan after all you should have the steak tips and gravy after all. But hey that's just a theory a menu theory.
Wow it's almost as if the pandemic was utilized to  help big business, and coerce local business owners to make difficult business decisions or shut down.
"What a waste of money" Bro you literally proceeded to throw a burger filled with money out of the window xD
Hahahaha jimmy you just got exposed but I will still eat you bugers
Hello, matpat long time viewer first time commenter anyway I had a question, I'm subscribed to a lot of YouTubers and some of them are even streamers and a lot of them are sponsored by either g fuel or gamer subs, so I've never tried either one but I would legit like to know which one is better figured it might make a fun theory video as well, love your content keep up the great work.
This video and your fast fast restaurants = real estate companies are my two favorite videos on Food Theory. Fascinating. Thanks.
The bad thing of mrbeast burgers is that only in USA not in all the world
Raise your hand if you tried looking up these foods and realized you live somewhere unpopular so there's nothing nearby 😔
#adamcalhoun2024
i got a menulog ad while watching this ToT
🍔
saw lots of these ghost restaurants happening in my area during covid haven’t seen this one though
Beast or matpat vote whos better in your opinion
So basically mr beast burger is exactly What i thought ?
You have to give us these soundtracks like in the description because some of them are bangers
If MatPat doesn't make his own fnaf virtual kitchen, I'll be disappointed
Hi
The only problem for the MrBeast burger is what will happen in the next years. With the vaccine ready is just a matter of distribution until the pandemic will be over,and with that the restrictions for restaurants will be removed as well. What are this only delivery ghost restaurants gonna do when peoples will return to going out for eating?
Well your rude dude
Imagine eating a money burger, and not realizing it’s a money burger.
I like the way he explains everything. Whether food or game he does it nicely
Yeah food theory was such I good idea, I love it so much!
https://youtu.be/3TzWar8B7iU
burGer
Man, I wish I could go to get a burger and randomly be given a ton of monies. Would be a lot better than the current literal total lack of monies I have. =/
FINALLY SOMEONE I CAN AGREE WITH! I can actually relate to someone about fake restaurants! You should come down for a bite, MATPAT!
These in my opinion are celebs who found a way to save the mom and pop businesses when it comes to food.  True the celebs are making money but the stores are able to keep their doors open.  They are able to pay their staff and keep their families feed.   These are people with a means to help doing so.  Not just doing lip service.
Start off as a ghost kitchen company, then you become a real estate company, that is the way.
Hey everyone! I’d like to ask those who are interested to come check out our show! Link: https://youtu.be/MpBq2Ne9Tcs  We are “The Self Sufficient Show” and we talk about regular every day American interests and topics! Thanks everyone!
We just ate at a MrBeast Burger a few days ago in Lansing MI, and it was ran out of a Bravo! The food was very good I hand the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich and it was probably the best chicken sandwich I have ever had no joke! The fries were also very tasty and the place also gave us a free box of at least 8 cookies for free! So if you wanna go to a MrBeast burger go to the one in Lansing, MI if you can the staff is friendly and the food is delivered fast. Since we didn't know it was virtual restaurant and drove all the way from Mancelona, MI (which is way up north, near Travers City, MI) we order the food right for the parking lot of the Bravo! and got it handed to us there.
No sh*t.. Jimmy said this was to help stimulate the economy in light of a pandemic. So you are 100% trying to profit on positive movements. You are salty about progression.
“Since you guys are last heres a bunch of money
I can’t stand mr beasts fake smile
0:38 I make 163 per day with *f u n d a i l y p a y*
So what you're saying is, get a MrBeast burger and also get cash? Also it's really cool that restaurants are being flexible to adapt to the times; normally I would assume that the brand was most important to the chain, and not allow any kind of shared space. GJ food industry :) Now excuse me, I have to go order a bag of money with a burger on the side.
"As a business owner" Bro... You are as much of a business owner than MrBeast is a restaurant owner. You might want to flatter your ego thinking a youtube channel is a business, but i will quote you "it's not"
But you should stop
Im sprry
Your not rich

I live in nyc and there’s no MrBeast burgers near me😤😤😤
he really likes saying buca di beppo because it rolls of the tongue 😂
Well if businessers see this video they got a new idea
Stop saying Buca de pepo ! It’s in my brain now 👊👊😅
I use just eat yes im british yes i like it when snoop dog is on the adds
Now that Mr.Beast has to follow one rule that is similar to Youtube  preserve the longevity.
Mr Beast: uploads a innocent video about free food Mat Pat: YESS, A NEW VIDEO IDEA!!!
Holy cow, one Google search and I've found that these are EVERYWHERE
Lmfao Buca di Beppo is real? What a dumb name. I thought you were making up a stereotypical Italian name

Soon he will buy every fast food chain
I found this to be the most fascinating episode of this series so far.
Congratulations on trending
I delivered a mr.beast burger hoping I would get 10k
This was a very interesting episode! ^u^
Tbh he only opened it to give away money
The basic concept of this isn't actually new. It's just applied to something that is completely different. Allow me to explain. "Ghostwriting" is when an author pays someone else to write their book for them, then the author publishes it under their name and (hopefully) the ghostwriter (not rider, writer, there's a difference) gets the cut of the profit alongside the author as does the publisher of the book. This practice has been a thing for many years. The concept (and the practice although not for writing books in this case) has been injected into the fast food industry thanks to the help of technology and it works for the hard times we're living in. A surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one, as it will help keep businesses afloat.
Great

Great video bro 😍
When I was here this was number 3 on trending
Is it just me or did you think that Buca di Beppo was just something he made us as your from the UK and had never heard of it
I wish I could order MrBeast burger but I'm not in the US  T_T
I made building blueprints i guess
No shade but it’s disgusting that someone would make a video like this because Mr Beast is a very hardworking man and I know for a fact it’s real because there is an actual app and you can buy the food depending on where you are
I work at a Buca di Beppo. We carry Tyga Bites,  Mariah's Cookies, and Mr Beast Burgers. We hate it. There's too many sauces for Tyga Bites. We barely get any Mariah's Cookie orders. Mr Beast has a ridiculous amount of customizations, and his beastly cultish fans are calling us at all hours asking if they can order over the phone and pick up.  Just no. I can already predict some child, man-child, or Karen of a mom will throw a tantrum at the table demanding Mr Beast Burgers when we re-open for dine in.
Ha the video lasts 11 minutes and 11 seconds
I literally ordered Mr Beast Burger 2 days ago
Everyone who has a virtual restorant here have such "original" names.
MatPat congrats on trending
waiting for MrBeast to make the chain international. don't hmu.

You know when it's serious when it's on the trending page🤔
Huh... So maybe in the future, there will be factory style kitchen which makes fresh food like clock work and deliver to their customers. I'm not sure if I am glad or fear of this news.   I'm glad is, well, everything is in one place, but my fear is because these kitchen may... Well, use pink 'slime', had a food safety issues, cleanliness issue, uses horse substitutes, and these are even more hidden to the public's eyes. Guess FDA needs to set a law on this and pronto, otherwise, they can sneak lots of surprises into our food (well, it's not like we haven't face this issues already and how screw up FDA is as well).
The burgers are not good and they forget orders and don’t put the toppings that you pay extra for and they also take 2 hours for the burgers to come. Which means that when the burgers come they are cold. So I do not recommend getting mr.beast burgers
I came to watch the Peasantry in the comment section.
This man will stop world hunger some day
#mattydaddy
https://youtu.be/scfDdTyn_n8  New song
Overall: *I thought Buca Di Beppo was a weird and random name MatPat was using*
Nahh your just jellos that u dont have a restaurant (not really a hate comment)
Yay your number 3 on trending
;-;
As someone who works at Buca di Beppo, I can confirm that we do get a lot of orders for Mr. Beast Burger, Mariah's Cookies, and Tyga Bites, with Mr. Beast being the most popular. I do think those services are keeping my location afloat because like MatPat said, even though our dining rooms are open, there haven't been as many dine-in customers as there were a year ago. It's completely shifted, with Hosts/Take-Out making more tips than the actual servers working there.
Huh?
never seen a better intro
Food dropship
Foood theory restaurant?
You forgot the bucca di beppo in hawaii
I’ve actually already heard of this from twitter lol
u know why because you are a hater and I love people i love and i love most youtubers
I got a Domino's Pizza Ad.
"A restaurant that gives money away." Mr. Krabs worst nightmare.
Idk why i love mr beast burger
You know, this is a pretty great idea to potentially use commercial kitchen space to start creating your own delivery style restaurant.
D-Did Mat Pat just advocate the murder of five children in a pizzaria?
Your video is great and the content is i love but please try doing so by avoiding controversial/clickbait titles. It is really annoying
In the UK we have deliveroo editions. They're ghost kitchens owned and run by deliveroo (a food delivery app). They're purpose built mass kitchens

Food Theory I have a question, does culture effect taste. I like pineapple pizza so I asked questions to some people I know and we are all from The Philippines, the question was "Do you think pineapple pizza/hawwian pizza is gross" most of them replied:"No" and the minority is "yes" actually I have never seen filipino people complain about pineapple pizza, the only ones I frequently hear complain are westeners, here is something to help you with your research "We are a tropical country"
I get the Ghouls part. Tokyo ghoul reference.
My theory is  Mr beast=purple man
because of Twitter suspend your president violence by Twitter rules  , we want Twitter suspend HongKong violence Taiwan violence by Twitter rules!  otherwise we will shut down Twitter in these area used!
Me who hasnt heard of the new resturaunt: *HE WHAT?*
7:50 I’m just trying to get What business our little matpat has? Also good video
VERY GOOD IDEA TO OPEN A FREE RESTAURANT!!!
That was in my home town
The quality of these ghost kitchens isn't really addressed and my order from MR Beast Burgers was terrible. It's a great idea but if it's going to be sustainable the quality has to improve.

Is this man for real tryna cancel Mr.Beast the man , the myth and the legend. Man is probably hungry for views so he put Mr.Beast in his keywords. Who is this guy Morgz from the grocery store?
You know, I really respect what Mr. Beast has been able to accomplish on his channel, but that doesn’t stop me from cringing every time he opens his mouth. How do people find him entertaining? I’m not trying to be offensive, I’m just genuinely curious! Are people just obsessed with seeing obscene amounts of money being given away or what? I never understood the draw of people like him, or Ellen, or Oprah. They pretend to be all nice and generous by giving away all these material things, yet they make all that money and more back just from people watching it! It’s genius, but why do people fall for it?! If you actually think that people like Mr. Beast are gonna die with $0, because they are “so generous” then you are the reason they are so rich! At the end of the day, he makes his money from psychological manipulation, which is both incredibly creepy and interesting to behold from the outside looking in!
I have neither heard of nor seen this place.
There's even "Fresh baked Chocolate Chip Cookie" on the menu
I'm telling you mr.beast is not who we think he is  His an evil genius all he did is part of his plan to rule the world  He will be the president of untied states and end the conflict and the racism and no more fighting or bullying and no more taxes because the money will be given equally in the economy   Hold up that sounds nice why I'm saying evil genius plan  Oh yeah for this part you will not have a saying in this he will be the president because he will be owning the entire state and he will gain no profits because the same second he gain the money it's going for the other businesses it's all planned and balanced
yes well that's buisness
I want to know one thing: do they sell vegan food?
This is the definition of drop shiping. Am I right ?
I wonder if there's going to be a crossover of sorts between Food theory, Film theory, and Game theory

Mann after this pandemic i want to go to meme town.sound like a cool place
Only reason I buy Mr. Beast Burgers but none of the others......is because I know at least with Mr. Beast, most of the money is going back to people who need it :) :) I dont mind spending more on stuff from him, because of what the money goes towards :) :)
Mans voice makes my ears bleed
Am I the only that thought that buca di beppa was fake??😬

Maybe mr beast is running out of money so he has to make a resturant
https://youtube.com/channel/UCPTuroGx7eUpWZeBm7IfSpQ
now we can see Twitter power over the president over the government!  what next? Twitter control the world!
So there would be a high chance that each burger at each location would potentially taste different due to different people cooking it?
Do a vegan teacher episode and show if being fully vegan is actualy good or no

Can we get this in England? Otherwise I'm just missing out.
I think the only Mr Beast Burger location near me is in Seattle.
I Love Mr beast Burger
My dream has come true
Dear Friend, receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior right now!! God's love for us is beyond our ability to fully understand, but not beyond our ability to realize, accept and enjoy. Because of God's eternal love for us He gave us His only begotten Son, Jesus the Christ. Whosoever believes in Jesus Christ, will NEVER perish but have eternal life. Submit to and receive the righteousness of Jesus Christ.                           I invite you to receive our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior whom died on the cross for the sins of ALL human-kind, arose in the 3rd day and currently sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                         Please pray the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, You are the KING of kings and LORD of lords. You are THE MOST HIGH, You are my Savior and my Lord, and I want to give You the highest place of honor in my life, I love You so much and I thank You, Amen!                                                                                             May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️      (Psalm 34 : 17-19;  Isaiah 41 : 10;  Psalms 86 : 15;  Romans 8 : 38-39)

No, delivering food is still weird and gross.
matpat links the chucky cheese video like not everyone has 999 times no he link it because he wants us to watch it a 1000 time
Didn’t expect to learn anything today but that’s cool!
It’s sad that I live in another country where Mr Beast restaurant doesn’t exit....😢😢😢
Cloud kitchens right?
Mr. Beast: vows to die with nothing in his bank his future children: umm where's our inheritance?
How much you wanna bet Mr. Krabs is their #1 customer
Make a video about artificial sweeteners because let's be real diet coke tastes awful
I always wondered what Bravo was. Passed several before and thought it looked odd.  Also, legit thought Buca Di Beppo was a made-up name in the first half. XD Never Seen one.
We'll you're pretty late to explain this concept, it's been there for years.
オレゴンきて車ください
idk what your saying is really i watched ti
What's happened to YouTube
Happy Beast meal .. I NEED IT
Ghost kitchens are good options for existing restaurants lacking customers. But there's a darker side to that coin.   A lot of ghost kitchens are sadly not up to code with too much staff and equipment crammed into a small space without even ventilation. Causing major health risks to the people working at those places.  And that is ignoring the long hours which are typical in that field of work (workweeks of 70+h isn't too uncommon). Yes delivery brands might set up ghost kitchens themselves. But that can also just be a container on some outskirts of town.
Ghost writers to ghost kitchens wow
Yep 300 locations...and not a one in West Virginia...not bitter about that at all lol (I'm not hating on him I just wish he found somewhere to produce his food here)
Hey Mr beast could you please shuffle your way to colorado for one of your videos......
mr beast burger needs to go international
So this is how Taco Bell won the restaurant war...
Stable video👍
Matt so rich he uses 100 doller bills as napkines
Are you telling me that a click-baiting YouTube hack is scamming people? How could this be?!
Food theory...? or food reality?
Thanks for creating such great video and they are amazing and wonderful. I love the brainwave music and hope more people can enjoy it too.
In n out could be huge but if you knew that the owner doesn’t want to expand all over the place because she’s already a billionaire and she wants her places done right and only in certain areas she wants and on top of that you have to do so much to open a new in n out every time
Hey food thriorists I hate you because your bad mouthing mr beast
And you wonder why small restaurants don’t stand a chance...
I skipped over two minutes and missed nothing. Huh.
There will be conflict only as long as there is the observer and the observed, which is what is. That observer creates a space in consciousness; this space in consciousness is always limited because there is always the observer and that observer is obviously memory, the accumulation of experience, which has been put together by time both chronologically and psychologically.
Wait.... isn't McDonald not a restaurant?
I ordered food from what I realize now is a ghost kitchen? The name of the restaurant was literally GhostKitchen lol
It was exactly what I thought then you didn't tell me anything i didn't already know

Wait... it means they all literally went to the _Fiverr_ of restaurant business??
This is basically how jacksepticeye's Top of The Mornin coffee works. It's a "ghost" coffee company that's using Akira coffee's expertise to sell their products. The beans and everything is sourced and roasted by Akira coffee, but the recipe and blends are chosen by Top of The Mornin Coffee
I could see you team up with Scott to open FNAF restaurants!!
But what would happen to grubhub doordash and all these restraunts after the pandemic?
This video is me just yelling Buca di Beppo at 5 in the morning
Mr Beast is taking over the world. I’m starting to think Mr Beast is actually “the Beast” the Bible warned us about.
We’re gonna run out of animals...
Lets just hope these "New locations" don't come to the UK. I can't stand Mr. Beast and all his money giving.
Americans' life expectancy world rank = #46 thanks to burgers, fries, pizza, stakes and sausages.  They are yummy though.
First virtual ytber , now virtual restaurant . We can have virtual theaters someda...ahh wait that's Netflix
Why this video was launched the same time as dad’s video?`
how rich is msBeast ?
Wait mr beast has a restaurant wait what 😱
the world is too much changed, my idol is still beethoven   nowadays idols are mrbeast PewDiePie etc
I’ve had beast burgers twice, the first time the second day it came out. It was absolutely horrible and came an hour late, the burger itself was meh and soggy really, but I had it again recently, and it was incredible, muchhhhh better. They’ve really ironed things out so that’s cool.
Seeing "ghost kitchen" oh his gonna talk about fnaf isent he
your just jealous  i know that look like a hate comment but I'm just a really big fan of Mr beast
Your average watch time must be horrible, didn’t make it past 3 minutes
I do wonder once everything goes to how it was in 2019 if we will have people going to restaurants more than delivery at least at first because people want to get out and miss the experience we aren't getting now
Close to us they don't even try to hide it. Cafetaria online; it's a snackbar, pizzaria, turkish place etc
Honestly my friends and I ordered food from Mr Beast Burger, and it sucked terrible. The food was cold, undercooked, and some of what we ordered didn’t even show up. We attempted to get a refund; they claimed they issued it, but we never received it. We will never order from Mr Beast Burger again.

We are starting to replace the old chains. I can't wait.
Hi 🙋‍♀️ how are you doing:)
I can imagine in the not so distant future that all restaurants get rolled into one mega store.  One food app like DoorDash or UberEats to get you anything and everything you want without having to deal with different companies, varying prices or varying degrees of quality.  No more worrying about whether or not a specific restaurant is open at a specific time.  No more worrying about the food from one restaurant at one end of town tasting completely different from the same named restaurant at the other end of town that also charges more for the same, but lesser quality, food.  Open the app, buy whatever you want.  But oh, wait, this is America and that is considered a monopoly.  Only Electrical and ISP companies can do that.
4:30 why'd you give him another pair of sun glasses LOL
you should make a discord were your fans can talk about theories they have(if you agree like this) wait he would need a disc
Oooh boi Mr beast wont like this    Or maybe he will after i watched it
Now I need a theory on chips. Not sure exactly on what BUT I feel like I need it 🥸
It is interesting to think about how covid will change daily life, like with the growing support of online restaurants for example.
wish germany woud be so smart
Marketing and presentation are a much larger part of the food industry than hardly anyone outside the business realize. That FNAF kitchen idea, could sell.
MrBeast Burger is hilarious

I bet there's gonna be about a million mrbeast lovers screaming at Matpat lol
DTF: Delivering The Food. Who doesn't know that.
Where I live Door dash has this whole thing going with another group running a place called Just Wings out of the Chili's
I like to order in a Food Theory Restaurant...
A LIE
Imagine  a game theory  based fast food restaurant
Its frickin free dude the burgers are free and yes “iTS a WaSTe Of mOnEY”
I got mr. beast burger today and it was burnt to the crisp😭
i think mr beast may comment
Uh Duh you sheep...Mr.Beast? 666? Free everything? Jesus Christ you all sleeping? anyways how good is that burger I love sonics.
Doesn't Fnaf AR count as a sister brand but less for food and more for deadly haunted animatronics?
Wow the video is exactly 11.11
Matpat: Mr. beasts burger is the next theory Markiplier: Alright guys Im real
Does the mr beast burger taste good?
Oh no it's just like in pikuniku 😬😬😬
are you a real person, or did you just steal, some ones picture, and use it for your own ?
What’s the difference from releasing your own restaurant  to perfume line, or literally every other object the lower middle class can buy?
The cheeseburger and Nashville hot chicken were pretty good. I just wasn't a fan of the beast style fries because other places have done loaded fries better and the addition of pickles on fries just felt off.
At this point I wouldn't even be surprised if Mr. Beast built his own planet💀
I just found out this guy now has a food channel Movies and games are enough But theorizing food? What's next adult movies?
Ehh taking to long to explain what it is so ima just read the comments
Hey respect Mr Beast la He even given away free money and never blame you guys for stealing moneys
Okay the tumnail was fake because i saw an youtuber (flamingo) have it so thats proof that its true thumnail
https://youtu.be/bi9vS8geGbY
Of course it wasnt x.x
But how do all these kitchens have the exact ingredients? For example, every McDonald's is delivered the bread, patties etc. Ive seen their trucks delivering the food to the restaurants many times.  You have to have the same brand/type of buns and patties.. or else the burgers would taste different depending on where you live/which kitchen is closest to you.
P.A Gang
Let’s see how many subscribers I can get. From this comment  Currents subs 7
In n out is quality over quantity
Who now think that mr. Beast is literally gaining money from ur yt views as well as from ur burger😱😱😱😱
I couldn’t find it on the food apps
We are making history
Trending. Nice
No way
I wonder this guy job.
Watch how he is finna explain the world is fake in the next video
Mr.Beast: makes food The Theorists  WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN
Matpat: 9:54 A duck: what about sister location
He doesn’t use ghost kitchens which is great, it’s al small already standing restaurants.
i got cancer.
Ребята давайти взаимные подписки кто потпишится на меня я взаимна!
Everyone: learns something really cool Me: learns Jimmy’s last name
(2:35) The nearest In-N-Out Burger to me is about 1,300 miles away, and I have never even seen one in person.  The nearest Mr. Beast Burger is just over 60 miles away; which is much, much closer, but I'm still unable to patronize them.
I never knew about ghost kitchens, this is so fascinating!
I mean who knows, FNaF may already have its own delivery app. Looking at you FNaF AR: Special Delivery
I just love hearing you say Bucca Dibeppo Matpat, it sounds awesome for some reason lol.
Congratulations for being on trending🥳
Isn't Jimmy your friend ?

Should've called it MrFeast Burger
The way he pronounces buca di beppo is so satisfying I have no idea why
Hi
Damn…I thought I was the first to come up with the idea of an anti-corporation designed to cost me all my money in the process of providing something great for the world. Guess I understand now why Mr. Beast got his own dragon in DragonCity…Still, it wasn't food I had in mind, so, you know, maybe my idea will still be a viable and novel one. In the meantime, I would TOTALLY get myself a Mr. Beast Burger now that I know his business model…if I wasn't on keto and didn't know that bread is literally the unhealthiest food in the world (aside from foods designed to be unhealthy, of course, like American candy). Actually, does he do lettuce wraps? Hmm, I may look into that…
There's a ghost kitchen chain in my area called Wing Depo, its super expensive but very consistent
It seems mr. beast is the opposite of McDonald’s. Mr. Beast is in the burger business not the real estate business.
Got a McDonalds ad on this video. Trying to shout louder than the competition
COOL thanks it was very interesting!
Can Mr Beast Burger come to New Zealand? Pls?
"He vows to die with $0 in his bank" His most recent upload: "Okay, I need to call my bank... I'm not sure I have enough money"
I want to try some 'Buca di Beppo'
You aren’t supposed to pronounce the ‘’t’’ at the end of bon appétit
The newest restaurant “Theory Bites!”  What do u think matpat
every time I watch this opening theme I find a new meme              I mean I'm not complaining
Mr beast is actually so smart
0:19 I am sent 191 everyday with this right here *f u n d a i l y p a y*
Get free STOCKS on Webull!!! https://act.webull.com/in/sMHhDdyVEkIR/fr6/inviteUs/recommend_1596_A_advert
Got a restaurant called "It's Just Wings" around here. Name says it all. They sell wings and boneless wings, which come with free curly fries, and that's it. Decided to look them up and actually do dine-in once the lockdown let up... and they're literally being delivered out of the local Chili's.
Hope MrBeast Burger will be in europe.
Given all the bad that came with the pandemic no many people look at the positive. I really like the reason shift. Delivery has become cheaper, better tracking, and easier. Same with grocery stores now delivering cheaply like Vons to give schwans competition. Plus requirement of masks I ain't gotta deal with anyone dragons breath and I can keep my face covered in public building without being assumed I'm going to rob them. Hygiene has been increasing with the fear. Plus being in winter masks help keep my face warm so nice change and I don't got to remove it everytime I go into a store. America has been behind in times/changes for so long it's nice to see a new frontier.
The fries are pretty good
Fake!!!
There was Travis Scott burger, then Mr. Beast burger.. soon.. there will be...         CANDY'S BURGER RESTAURANT!!
👍
burgis
I think we need a Mr beast burger in india..
Try as I might, I can’t bring myself to care about MrBeast.
Ok chill bro, mrbeast is more famous
Plzzz check my new video out just came up and my content is funny entertaining but slept on because my city IOwa has no culture and it’s hard to make it out 😭
Number 3 on trending
It makes me wonder if the flavor and quality stays the same for every ghost kitchen. I mean, if you go to McDonald's, you know how your burger is gonna taste most of the time, is this the same for mr beast for example?
$1,000 Walmart Card (Giveaway)  Just sent me a message if you want to win $1,000 ➜ bsnscubax@gmail.com   Good Luck! ✅
ik FNAF is old now but HOLYYY that would be a cool idea 😂 magine the pizza boxes. they would look cool it would also bring FNAF back for a while
His burgers are juicy.
between Dad, Mark, and Mr. Beast. I'm starting to think nothing is real anymore XD
Hi
https://youtu.be/ADWChZG_fDM
Ya know... I have never seen a single mr. Beast vidio in my life, not even one
This is going to be a quality control nightmare.  People are going to notice the difference from one location to another.
Food Theory: Mrbeast burger is Beating Mcdonalds estates!
I tried Mr. Beast Burger tonight and I think it gave me food poisoning :/
I’m honestly just wondering how Mr Beast makes enough money to do stuff like this
Buca de bepo is my new favourite thing to say
First Markiplier and now this? 2021 is shaping u ppl to be quite the year
You look and sound like the odd1sout
Imagine caring this much if u want a free burger js say tht
thats right u dont talk bad about mr beast
Havent tried yet but sounds pretty darn good
"Bucca di Beppo" is fun to say over and over again.  Edit: Holy crud I thought that restaurant name was made up!
Food Theory: What happens when you don't say when?
Am i the only one who goes to mcdonalds instead of ordering a delivery
Just a quick reminder. Please don’t forget to TIP your servers if you choose to go out and eat and TIP the person who is delivering your food ❤️
I don’t think beast could look any less beast and any more soulless
I could not stop thinking about fnaf while watching this
I’m really glad this is trending. Getting a good channel into the spotlight effectively yeye 😌
Mr Ditkovich is rolling in the dough.
Watch the video i link in the reply! worth the watch. videos are posted everyone tuesday & Fridays
This shows intro kinda looks like an old shitty game
Well now I just want to try pizzas from those restaurants.
Mrbeast (while I don’t watch him) he’s the bill gates of YouTube
There's no N in "restaurateur" by the way.
the real problem it's your voice speak of who? for rich for government , or for yourself for people!  the media control by rich they just want u listening to them!  that is why u need make voice speak for your self for most of people!
anyone scrolling down  to find a mrbeasts comment or just me
It's a sandwich
ok but like i liked my burger 👁👁
I’d 100% eat at a burger joint called The Matty Patty.
He must be making bank off of all of these channels
Today I learned something knew and also the people that came up with this are absolute geniuses.
I am sure one day MatPat is going to reveal the command console for the simulation known as Real Life.
Tbh you got me in the first half
I just looked up the one my area... It's a fosters freeze. lol. Looks like really greasy menu... sure why not.
I wonder how we could do delivery ice cream? Now that's something I'm interested in starting up!
Sorry but money isn't made out of paper
Nobody:  MatPat: *BUCA DI BEPPO*
for food theory we should call you mac pat...no ok 😅😐
Drying my eyes, believe it or not😭😭😭
9:10 but thats only $64
Game Theory, Film Theory Food Theory, Meme Theory    Thats just my personal Options it might be
Ordered from Beast Burger, food was low quality, order was messed up, overall poor experience. Definitely don't recommend it lmao
Not me thinking "Bubba di Beppo" was a made-up restaurant name for the video.
https://youtu.be/j6EKvILnr9M  🤣🤣🤣💪
Dude!! I went to Texas a couple weeks ago and I really wanted to try the MrBeast Burger so my gf and I went to those 2 Southlake locations but because they just looked like normal restaurants we didn’t go in. And since she lives outside their delivery radius we couldn’t door dash it either. That’s a bummer
Watch the last day man a
When do we see the Food Theory restaurant where all the menu items are experimental as research for an upcoming episode?
I think the people who disliked this video just read the title and got mad without watching the actual vid
There's a place near me that you can get food from a dozen or so restaurants and fast food places all in one building.  It's mostly for delivery, but you can go there yourself and place orders on a touch screen menu (from multiple places or just one), and the food comes up on a convertor belt.  I think it only has one employee around to hand over the food or offer help.
Huh, Now I know that Americas also have MTV although I'm sure they are different than MTV Lebanon lol
Mr beasts tax right offs must be crazy
Wow and I went the other day to the address that’s was on the app and found some weird restaurants thinking my gps was bugging out
Ppl just searching for  mrbeast's comment 😳               👉👈
This is genius. Don’t play.
Because he is the head of the mexican cartel
my goodness! https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dr4ChVRWhwU
Strike strike strike January 20 at Noon.   We need to withdraw our support from the economy and inconvenience the rich and the powerful.   We will not be silenced.
I mean this is cool but it would just be eating another burger  Now it would be cool if i seen the mr beast restaurant and walked in it
So cinemas are going to go and restaurants are going to go whats next matpat? Are hospitals going to go? Will you just have to rent a doctor for a day?
BOOOOOOOOOOO
Bruhify raid
OMG OMG! Thank you so much matpad! I got a new idea how to expand my small Family Business in the virtual world! Thank you so much!
._.
MatPat’s Taco Stand
The first person to say NO to Mr beast :OOOO
So I click on a video about mr beast, and get about 20% of it discussing matpat fantasising about irl fnaf. I’m not surprised.
If you wait untill the start of act three just to explain what a ghost kitchen is F off... Oh thank god for once. At least it was act 2's start
If anything, this is a very good way to keep business going for kitchens that would otherwise not have a lot of people come in.
You know what doing a FNAF one isnt so bad if you think about it
Food Theorist theory: This channel was created and is operated by the restaurant industry. Directional advertisement at its finest.
9:10   Finally Ditkovich got his rent now
Huh...so this channel exists, wack
Note to self: Dont watch this channel when hungry...
End of the day it’s a win, win, win, lose cuz then del every drivers be charging hella for your order
john 3:16
Haven't watch the video but let me guess, "Mr beast burger" is not a in the fast food industry, but is in real estate industry like Mcdonald
Want to die with zero money While mister beast gaining millions on daily basis _Task failed succesfully_ ?
It sucks that where I live the only thing that delivers to me is papa John’s
I mean it was kinda obvious you didn't actually think he opened 342 physical locations? lol
Mr beast is on trending twie lol
Please Book Theory pleaaaaaaaaaaaaase
7/11 is ice cream shop  Pasquallys is Chuck E. Cheese  It’s just wings is chili’s
Amizing mr beast it was a cool
Let's face it. When this comes to the UK you know it's all coming from Wetherspoon's
You are on some THIN THIN ICE
So what's the theory ???
Mr BEAST FOR PRESIDENT
If only there was a gaming store doing this with card games board games and video games ran buy a streamer
Me: (too lazy to cook) Ah yes time to support a local business in these trying times.   (For real support your local restaurants)
"But if you close your eyes"
*Hes Mr beast he can do anything so dont worry*
"Heres your order." Chucks wad of money at customers face
matpat: "And they were roommates!" me: "oh my god they were roommates"
Mr beast makes 64k a day fun fact
Don’t like it.
As an Uber Eats driver, I was very surprise to pick up food from food trucks and drop it off at fancy neighborhoods. Its of course, because they use the name concept! They dont say food truck, instead they go by many names that sound like they especialize in certain foods, which makes people think they are ordering from very nice places! Basically if people can't see where they get their food, they can't pre-judge it and just assume everything is up to their usual level..
Careful, Mat, you're going to give Scott ideas
The video is 11:11 minutes longs
Mr Beast sucks and is overrated
It's a ghost kitchen thing.  I know a chain operation that decided to try it out.  Apparently our area was wildly into it, they seemed to love it.
Nah the employees aren't happy
One word........convenient
Imagine being a chef & being rented out to make fast food
That's obvious.  Mr. Beast's videos all about $$$.  Check out his titles.  It shows how "obsessed" we are for money. I'd rather watch this....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXWlflVPcx4
Lol capitalism sucks
If it was wheat free I would make Mr Beast Burger be the first burger I ever tried
I Won't be surprised if he become the richest person within 10 years
"MrBeast Burger is not what you think" Me: "Wtf is a MrBeast burger?"
YOU are loved and in need of a savior , we are living in the last days . Please don’t turn away from God he is calling YOU. Deep down you know there is a higher power , a higher creator . John 3:16 , for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son , that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life . Repent of your sins , accept Christ as your savior . Believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that you have sinned , we have all sinned and fall short of the glory of God.  Believe that God sent his only son ( Jesus Christ ) to die on the cross for your sins, the price of our sins was paid in full  ! Accept his gift and you will have an eternity with him! JESUS CHRIST RETURN TO CLAIM HIS CHURCH IS AT HAND . Don’t be left behind when millions of people go missing !
°W°
Now im hungry
Q) How does the food from these brands remain constant?
hi
I'm okay with the idea, but there should absolutely be a disclaimer when you're ordering. Maybe this will help small businesses instead of already rich celebrities...?
FINALLY JUST FOUND OUT THE THIRS PLAYER FINALLY UNLOCKED
I love it when mat proves his theorys but still says the iconic line "But hey thats just a theory...A GAME THEORY"
I'd like to know how the actual chefs in these Ghost Kitchens feel about having to learn and remember more menu items
Ok I've seen youtubers selling card games and such but never a full on restaurant chain!
I’m waiting for FNAF to be made real, MatPat. I’m sure you and Scott can put your insane minds together
Pls shut make a restaurant and talk
9:08 the real spider man fans will get it😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Booger burger
Is it bad that every time I see something about Mr. Beast giving away money I die a little inside cause I'm still broke?
We do this business actually to rent out space for third party guys to setup a kitchen, they make the deals with restaurant and cook the meals. We don't call it a ghost kitchen but we call it a cloud kitchen because everything is virtual
I love mr beast so I don’t like this vid but I love mat pat
Subscribe for a Lamborghini!   Let’s help each another. Let's do it.👈🏻❤️🔥🔥 https://www.youtube.com/c/MedAgajja/videos
Say: "Bucca di Beppo" one more time...
I wish you went with Pauly D is DTF:  Down To Feed
I dont really know if this is true.........
I live in California, other than In N Out I didn't recognize a single brand in this video
They say I sound like polo g...😴😴https://unitedmasters.com/m/5ffa95d986f54869df1a6600
I'm a simple man. I see Mr. Beast. I see MatPat. -> Like.
Mr. Beast is either the maddest madlad to ever exist or some crazy mad scientist genius trying to keep wholesomeness alive.
So he put you in a video and you’re just gonna do this to him
Wtaching this at 1 am makes me hungry
funny enough buco di beppo opened a mr beast burger near me
Woah!
I ordered from that 250 west bridge street the day it opened and pulled up and couldn’t find it to find out it was a bravo
What is the solution to all the rural on USA who cant afford to eat like this? A majority of USA is rural and poor. How would this work? Seems like a route for elite urban to gain more voice.
H get vrvvvbfbff be me d
Wow, as someone who owns a family restaurant that has suffered with the lockdown (since we heavily rely on dine in), theses virtual kitchen ideas might be the last bit of hope of keeping us in business
Man I love meritocracy and capitalism
Not only is this genius, it's incredibly ethical! Put people to work during a time when so many restaurants are struggling right during a time when contactless delivery is at its peak!
Hey Matt, so what will happen to all those ghost kitchens once the pandemic is over
I love your content, but unfortunately I won’t be watching this video because I cannot stand Mr. beast whatsoever.
This is like an ad 4 beast burger
I think the fact that he hasn't commented on this yet confirms this
Eh I don't really care at least i get to eat if it's trash food eh im still eating it
It always feels like the intro is cut ahort
What I got from this is that its not hard to open a virtual resturant network... Soooo, when that Theorist burger coming?
I downloaded the GrubHub, DoorDash, Uber Eats apps so I could order delivery only to find out that not a single restaurant delivers to where I live :(
😆 🤣 😂  https://youtu.be/qWKDJRL_Ob0
dont you love a cash grab and a bun
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
Scott hopefully watching this channel too
It it fake ?
I can't wait until Mr. Beast Burger opens in my country.
Its not fake liar
Wish someone would toss me money at drive through, then I could actually buy dentures and eat that dribe thru food.
This is mean mr beast is the kindness person
I guess you could say that the subs eat this up....
⚠️*WARNING: SELF PROMO*⚠️ - I made a Harry Potter edit on my YouTube channel!! U choose your favorite set of cakes and it revealed which character you would DATE (or who you just really love in general)   This is for all the Potterheads out there!
So if I order a MrBeast Burger it's essentially the same bread, meat and other ingredients my local McDonald's uses, just under a different name.
i want food theory burger and it comes with a theory in everybag
Food theory is the best theory channel. Dont know how that happened
What's worse then a Biden presidency???  "TRENDING" YouTube section.
This is completely wrong. He’s sourcing local restaurants to fulfill the orders, not a ghost kitchen.
hello there traveler of the recommendations... it's me, Bedecick, now then, i expect your arrival in a few days, few weeks, few months, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032 and beyond! have a good day.
ur welcome https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0xu-0kh63Mc&list=RD0xu-0kh63Mc&start_radio=1 💕
I hope with this we will see a Game Theorist restaurant. I know Matt is so busy with his bussiness, youtube and child, but IT WOULD BE COOL
Good job getting 3rd on trending
Is mat going to lunch a 5 nights restaurant
The burger ain't all that tbh. You could get a better burger at 5 guys
Food delivery in China has been doing this for years....
SCP 6001
I want a Mr. Beast burger 😔
Dude I know you want to make Theories for the channel but why do you have to ruin fast food for us come on
Okay, this coincidence freaked me out. In my location, there is a town center called Bridge Street and in that center is a Bravo's that's also a ghost kitchen for Beast Burger.
Me sitting here across the atlantic waiting for beast burgets to get here
But why is he presenting it like actual restaurant location in the first video? Its manipulative
I am GLAD I watch ur videos
i kinda knew that
brilliant
This all makes sense now
Buca di bepo is the most fun name on the planet
Nice.
Food theory pizza
WOW Learned something new today but too bad I can’t do this ...
American billionaires will increase their wealth by an average of 57% in 2020. According to the Federal Reserve, the total net assets of the top 1% of Americans are $34.2 trillion, while the poorest 50% of Americans (about 165 million) are only $2.08 trillion. Social wealth distribution is extremely unfair! So we need to find a fair way of wealth distribution! fix real problem!
Bucca de beppo is my favourite restaurant ever
I want this in the UK mannn
I love Mr beast Mariah Carey and all of the other guys as much as anyone elsebut I think that it's wrong to use others hard work time and money to make a fortune of their own
E
I went on google and read the reviews and lots of them were like "Burger buns were burnt, fries were soggy, and the cheese wasn't even melted. Very, very dissapointed ☹😭😢😥😔😖😡😾😿💔🙍‍♀️🙍‍♂️🙎‍♀️🙎‍♂️"
https://youtu.be/bli8lrKwSVE its fun in here
The fazbear pizza should serve nightmare chica sliders
Im just suprised that "Buca Di'Beppo" is a real resturant
Hey I got an idea for you your do witch is the better chips
MatPat: " ... and my question is, HOW?!?" Me: " Well that depends, how much time do you have to water Mr Beast episodes "
I know what the next Theory channel is! It’s...   Music Theory!
To the 3% of people who see this, I hope that you get all you want for this year and have a wonderful future ahead of you!!🧡have a great life and good luck in the future✅I know fame doesn’t happen overnight but I’m trying my hardest to become a successful creator ️
I don’t like soggy food so delivery has never been my thing but you millennials apparently like laziness over soggy, just sayin’
Mat Pat we need a Theory on Gordon Ramsay
So like a ghost writer but kitchen?
MrBeast Burger couldn't've been what I thought, because I'd never heard of MrBeast or his eponymous burger until this video.
Nice but that’s good
Okay so, I live in Arizona and from where I am located the nearest Mr.Beast Burger is in Scottsdale. I also looked up the other "restaurants" and the only one I could find was Tyga Bites. Both of them had been in the same location, 3828 N Scottsdale Rd. And get this, I look up the address on Google Maps, it's a freaking BUCCA DI BEPPO. Mind officially blown.
I just want to say that lots of people ON YouTube eat mrbeast buger on video and say its amazing so this is just your opinion of mrbeast burger.
Mr. Beast is so lucky some American's don't wanna cook :D
I asked for a mrbeast burger but it said that there where no results
This is such a brilliant idea! Not only is food getting delivered but the colorless part is they help businesses stay open!
BUCA DI BEPPO
Matpat is the biggest snitch ever
Wait Markiplier isn't real?
Real lief fnaf Resturant : Pizza at the day and a Single Person horror experianc

Welcome to another episode of The Food Factist
I- what-
I live like a mile from the south lake bucadibepo that he used for it and had no idea!
This is wild
https://youtube.com/channel/UCWmHe5D7ZpaBMcrPLTz80CA
Jimmy is an alien from the future.
If you liked this you gotta see this video!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBKAaAAJsvg
MatPat really likes FNaF irl and just realize animatroni-
💜💜💜💜
I've gotta say, Mr Beast is absolutely the most chaotically good person that I have ever seen. The stunts he pulls in his videos are goddamned wild, and I really admire his gumption and drive to do what he does on the reg. Though I don't watch his content, I do absolutely wish him the best
Some many random links in the replies
Poor waiters and waitresses..
We’ve had this for a few years in Australia. The states is so far behind the rest of the world 😂
For future videos can you please put sources because when I talked to people about these topics, it doesn't sound credible to say "A Youtube video said." thanks
You expect me to spend 30 bucks on a meal from beast burgers by delivery? Fast food used to be cheap bro
Ordered from a place called Wow Bao that I found out was based out of a Ruby Tuesday. I only found that out because I was called by them because they were out of a flavor of bao that day.
Yeah his restaurant sucked
Mrbeast is on No 1 trend and No 3 😂😂😂😂
This isn't brilliant this is super scummy. Like the fact that any celebrity needs to start a fast food business for even more money/ notoriety, but now they have the added benefit of not having to actually do anything?! Seriously that puts a sour taste in my mouth. Whatever though I guess my families business can continue going under and we can starve and be broke. And that's totally okay because some asshole Youtuber planted some trees and gives islands to people so now
Thank you matpat you ruined my favorite restaurant the third time
I'd be curious to see how the staff feel about making all the different foods...
No caps rip
It's almost like the restaurant equivalent of a side hustle, I'm curious now to see how this will expand
bukedepeeepo
Yes
Now you have to open a chain called  "boop ito bepo"
10:27 looks like the doctor doctor who am i wrong or ???
Lol this isn’t even tru there is like 20 locations 😀😅😂🤣
I'm going to start buckadibepo stores.
As soon as all this Mr Beast Burger business became a thing, I immediately hopped on the same exact research boat in knowledge pier on cape education, and I'm excited more people know! The one near my house works out of a Bertuccis.
I for one LOVE this trend in the food industry, primarily because it helps out the little guys who are struggling right now... Provided they can get connected to a celeb or someone with the finances to fund this kind of business model.
Good
Me: *watches food theory video* Doordash ads: its free real estate
Hey, hey he is still possessed by food
1 million views
Me who already knows:"IMMA WATCH IT CUZ I WANNA HEAR MATPAT EXPLAINING STUFF AS MY ASMR"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA3___6Cx00           NC       MOB
Chilis does this with it's just wings on door dash. I order it's just wings about 1 or W times a week lol
The real reason Mr. Beast spends so much money is to hide his mafia dealings.
8:03 who thought the screen of your phone or ipad turned and tries to flip your device only for it to turn back and turn again?
No shade but *HORRIBLE FIRST-TIME EXPERIENCE*   I was so excited to post about this on my foodie acct @ari.recommends on IG that bought this the day after it opened in my town but they got both orders wrong. Doordash was no help b/c theyre 3rd party and the store number forwarded me to a voicemail.   I eventually received a text a couple weeks later and they refunded me. I follow MrBeast & would try it again but DANG...horrible 1st time experience ✋🏽😫
I noticed that delivery only restaurants were really picking up now that delivery is a much bigger thing, and that they often shipped from the same location, but I never knew that there was a name for it. Neat!
People need their business back
Bitcoin is on the rise!!!!
I wonder how the staff at these kitchens feel? I get they are not as busy as before but if you’re  running like 4 “restaurants” out of one kitchen it’s sounds overwhelming.
Hi
It's so fun to have a new theory channel. The videos are okay,  but being able to notice things in the intro is the best. Looking at you nyan cat.
I didn’t know there were delivery only restaurants. There’s not a restaurant near me that delivers.
All I got from this theory is that were getting closer to complete obesity
Wait when did this happen? I have never heard of this
I have none of these restaurants near me.
So it like Zomato?
This makes sense - hasn't anyone wondered why they haven't seen any Beast restaurants in person if it's available near them?
I always think it’s KwebbleKop talking
When MatPat adds shades to Mrbeast who is already wearing shades...
Love the intro
Wat
Jesus is coming back give ur life to Christ be born again and be saved it’s not too late yet get prepared Jesus died for ur sins and he is coming back again God created everything Get right with God before it’s too late don’t ignore this please
This channel should be called "business theory"
our local beast burger is located in the same place as buca di beppo... lol
So he's basically just helping out small restaurant and not saying he's doing it More like in a I scratch your back you scratch mine kinda way COOL COOL Mr beast
It would be cool if you and some other YouTubers made a fnaf brand and have different pizza for the different I animatronics, that would make money
The Internet and modern technology making everything easier yet again. Makes me wonder if ANY product line could use this strategy, if they aren't doing it already. That would be revolutionary.
Is this going towards the 'FastFood Wars' they were talking about in Demolition Man?
stop being this way to mr beast
https://youtu.be/vvzhRaEzYgs  Don't watch this video because you start thinking. You wouldn't want it?
Did any Toby fans go crazy over the mr. dickovich😂😂
Beast hater booooooooooooooooooooooooo food theroy
"and by city directory, I mean Google" That one got me more than I care to admit.
I'm really glad that this video isn't dissing Mr.Beast but actually showing the genius behind this whole thing.

I'm going to start a new restaurant. I'll let you know how it turn out!!

Me checking through the comments to check if Mr Beast replied
MrBeast watching this be like :👁👄👁
ok this just exposes the business
oh great its mr beast theory whats next? how to fry an egg?
1:21 it's all dollar bills lol
What reason would I have to order from said celebrity "restaurants" over going directly to the source?
The brand. Need to count the brand value for the "win win win" cut. If the brand didnt do well, things wont thru as smooth. Thats why u see celebrity does this better. If u aint famous, ghost kitchen probably not a good go.
This is the 29th video
Money is is made of cotton

i tried tyga bites and was so disappointed. I was going to try and order from MrBeasts burger but the ptsd i got from Tyga's food came back full force.
raid the comments NOW MY soldiers!!!!
"If you die poor ,it's your fault" Mrbeast: challenge accepted
So beast burger to save the brick n mortar stores, nice!
I haven’t eaten from Mrbeast Burger, but IK I’m probably gonna prefer Matdonalds.
Who else hasn’t been able to get captions to work
i had a mr beast ad before the video bruh
I don't know about anybody else's experience with ordering from MrBeast Burger, but I wanted to buy into the hype and see what it was all about. I ordered the day after the big launch and, our food took 2 hours to get to us, it was cold, there were burnt charred bits covering most of it and it was just bad. I get what he was trying to do, and he has a massive base that'll support anything he does- but with a venture like this maybe paying attention to a bit of quality along with the quantity might do a bit of good.
Okay but I really wish Scott would make actual restaurants that sounds magical
Me who uses skip the dishes laughs in Canadian
Wow
We have swiggy ,zomato in IND
The "Mr. Beast Burger" rolls off the tongue very well. It's like... He was made for this.
Exactly. It gives the staff *something* to do
No wonder im poor, im not smart enough to think about this way of entrepreneurship x'D

Beast will be the most subbed and most richest cause its like a brand now selling a bunch of stuff sooo TAKE THAT T-SERIES btw india is like a country of scammers so t series is prob scamming a complete opposite of mr. Beast
The in n out shown at 2:43 is the one across the street from my house.
mrbeast a goat
better believe he puts every dollar he gave away on his taxes
I have had mr beast burger and it was good I will definitely be getting it again, especially now that I know he is helping the restaurant industry. I work in the industry and it is not good for a lot of people so what he is doing helping people keep their jobs is amazing.
But what happens when COVID is over?
Huh. That’s super interesting. What a cool business model. I do wonder if ghost kitchens will be feasible post-pandemic but right now it seems like a great option for all involved parties.
whats worse that game theory? this. its succeeds in being just as annoying... but is also several minutes stretched out for a simple 1 minute explanation.

Mat, YOU CAN'T EAT HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL'S!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Screw delivery only. Not going to shell out extra money to pay for delivery.

This is so funny, exactly two hours after you posted this video Mr. Beast posted a video

I've been watching matpat consistently longer then any other YouTuber this man is doing everything right
https://youtu.be/10iwKvdHO2c it explains why Olive Garden trounced the competition. Also MatPat is 7 steps ahead of everyone all the time. Did who was able to figure out the last altered reality game. Arg!!
I thought it said Food Terrorists
Could you do a theory on the science of pizza if you have not already
🤸‍♀️🤸‍♀️😎🙃
Soo let’s get a Food Theory restaurant 👀
We have a "Commercial Kitchen" in my town, used for cooking classes, private caterers who need more space, and of course, "Hot Mess Burgers And Wings." You CAN pick it up on-site, but there is no dine-in option. DoorDash, GrubHub, or grab it yourself, just don't stay to eat! (and they were already doing this well over a year ago, just cheaper than leasing a whole building!) The kitchen is amazing and I am dying to find an excuse to rent it.
You put a icon for Mr Beast Burger in Maine but there is not a location there
Now THIS is the kind of Food Theory I want- just straight informational exposure of business secrets, without the math
and then I'm in the UK and not the US  :(  guess that means no mr beast burger for me.

Food theory: get a life and stop putting out click bait 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
O wait moriah has a cookie line! I want one THAT SHE MADE(shes my FAVROET SINGER EVER!)
no, this is much more realistic, *only people that play plague inc. will understand* mrbeast just has the turbo strain, making the contry he starts in instantly grow with a insane amount of resteraunts right away.
It is

Ok this just gone to far

so he’s dropshopping burgers lmao
As a postmates driver, this explains why twice I was so confused when. I had a order for one restaurant but spent 5 minutes trying to find it and thinking my GPS is crazy when I had to pick it up from a completely differently named restaurant!
Bro, I just want a burger
Mr. Beast literally explained it in his video and you made a video saying the same thing in a diffrent point of view.  Wow, you are desperate for the clicks.
:)
haha waste of money
The video is 11:11 so an angel is watching Mr Beast
This sounds a lot like rental property, but for food.
I thought dad had matpat I think I’m lost
Hey matpa did u enjoy ur FOOD
So are the Mr. Beast burgers any good?
Wait so I keep seeing this thing about how all Skittles taste the same but when I look it up I get both that they taste the same and they all are different... Please do another theory like with the Froot Loops... I must know
Oh boy I can smell the dislikes coming in
I like the reference to NEW Super Mario Bros
This is basically dropshipping but w/ food rather than material products
Omg 250 W Bridge St is 25 minutes away from me.
Fun fact: The Mr. Beast Burger video was actually recorded in a “Burger Boy” in Wilson, NC. Steph is from NC!!! (and so am I)
This really is a genius idea!
its not a waste of money when everything there is free. plus they give you money because of the wait
i left a comment on every food theory video thus far with in 24 hrs. this is my attempt to continue that trend
So when’s the theorist restaurant coming?
I think everyone agrees with me here, the only reason people went to restaurants was usually for unlimited, restaurant soda (tastes better than store bought), unlimited appetizers (chips, bread sticks), and free condiments.
Wtf men im a fan of mrbeast and you and you just ruined it
Moral of the story : if you wanna start a restaurant, get famous first
Waiting for mr beast fans to rage blidly in comment section. Wait, we aren't 14 years old right?
I didn't know this:/
New theory channel idea: THEORY THEORY
When 2 of the top 3 trending videos are Mr Beast related.
Food theorist wtf?
He covered what these are but he never went over the negatives of these ghost restaurants. While the menu is super small for these places it still takes time to make this product. I technically work for 7 restaurants and do the work for all of them including the training to learn how to cook these things, however I only get paid to work for one of them and it's som much work without the pay and it is super frustrating working so many things at once and not being compensates.
Shut
i’m starting to doubt food itself
yes.
This is kinda fake there is actually locations there is one in New Jersey
did no one notice the money pun at the beginning ?
I wonder how long these virtual chains will last after the pandemic is over? I know things won't go back to exactly how they were pre-pandemic, but more people will still go eat at the restaurants and they won't be able to keep up with the extra menus.
The title is a bit startling and harsh but, I mean, come on, ALL of them are, Diet Coke is good btw  Keep up those Theory videos!!!

Perfect sales pitch hahaha
This is so smart
Mrbeast is likely to hit 100M Subscribers this year the way his channel is growing I think he can achieve his goal
But if the celebrity went for another kitchen it would damage your business.
i wish i can get a MR Beast burger
Theoretically, because The Chum Buckets got no costumers but is still a kitchen, MrBeast could go there and pay them that millions of money and then the Chum Buckets can actually make good food, could MrBeast be in Spongebob? NANII?!?!

Time for a the Food Theory Foods. Everything made of trees. Just trees. Everything is spruce.
I cleaned restaurant exhaust canopies in Australia, quite a few restaurants had the main dine in area (pre pandemic, I now live back home in New Zealand (dodged a bullet there)) and they also had a virtual restaurant in the back with boxes that had branding different from the main restaurant.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.

Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen!! Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
I will never get over the fact Karl's style has an inverted bun.
Meanwhile, in Jacksonville, Florida a local Jaguar(Local Americain Football player) Opened a brick-and-mortar fast-food chicken chain called PDQ... So yeah you can open a brick-and-mortar chain if you want to you just need to stick to a city and open only 4 restraints... Also, PDQ is the best fast-food chicken reastraunt of all.

Why do no videos on YT have captions anymore 😭 Ig I’ll watch this later 💖
pov : you're looking for mrbeast's comment
This is a cool idea in general, though one caveat is that a restaurant serving arbitrary menus will have a hard time reaching the same quality as a focused restaurant built around one specific streamlined menu.

Lol Postmates
Hey matpat remember when you were in a mr.beast video
20 vet chef here. |There is one issue here you did not mention with ghost kitchen. is the time and expansive knowledge of menus and memorization. Unless you have a limit to how many kitchens or kitchen can take on you need what is called " Bibles" hard draft copies of each celebrity food. then its also a matter of team logistics. team A learns menus 1,2, and 3. too many and you overload the system/ workers. next is the storage of the food and legal. if not kept relatively small it can become a plate-spinning act. This is something many cooks cannot handle and puts undue stress on the individual. Love the food videos though.
You calling them “ghost kitchens” makes me lose my appetite :/
I was waiting for the catch but I guess there isn't one... yet😈
DAD will win
He keeps changing his intro....
Over priced burger and tastes like a POS .... he’s a scammer
This is exactly what I thought it was
This is super cool!  I just worry that it might not be a sustainable model if/when things go back to normal; will those kitchens be able to keep up with their own orders as well as ie Mr. Beast’s? If they can’t, won’t they prioritize their own customers over ie Mr. Beast’s?

Watch out people! FoodTheory is launching MatDonalds I can feel it 🤤
My mom doesn't like it :(
So everyone is getting a cut beside the people cooking and preparing the order....👀
This just blew my mine!!
Ghost kitchens are good from a business standpoint but thing I don’t like about it is that it makes your decision of food based off of branding rather than quality. With regular restaurants you have a good idea of the quality of food and you can trust it’ll be good because the restaurant specializes in a specific genre of food. With ghost kitchens you don’t even what kitchen your food is coming from and the sheer difference in quality between restaurants was immediately viewable by the people who ordered Mr. Beast burger when they first came out.
Mat Pat be in a dilemma, if to put the KFC console in Game theory or Food theory
Brilliant idea💡
Him mentioning sister brands and ghost kitchens  Me: It’s happening isn’t it, it’s him *demonic fnaf noises start*

I live in the Cincinnati area and the closest one to me is a Buca di Beppo.
Omg could imagine it Chuck e cheese had a fanaf theme for October
When he said DTF I literally thought it was Down To F what is wrong with me
Me: goes to a Italian restaurant  Me: can I have a mr beast burger The waiter: ok
Mr. beast took over the Buca in my town
Im thinking its fake because mrbeast burger is awsome!
Matpat..... Do you hate or love fnaf? XD the line is blurred a little. Like, you want a Fnaf themed restaurant to exist and yet you kinda complain whenever new stuff is announced XD
Everybody do me a favor and dislike this video
So are we not gonna talk about how this is just a strategy for giants to win market share? Aight
lol what if mr beast saw this video and commented on this video
That's ingenious!
Wait google maps says there is one near me
Getting money from food is cool
Nj
We’re u guys in jj?
bro its just burger restaurant
I feel for the Kitchen Staff.
Do you guys know if Mr beast has a shop open in Alaska?
I need Mr Beast Burger in the UK
I feel like this also is like the downfall of Blockbuster due to companies like netflix. Who would want to drive all the way to the nearest Blockbuster when you can get the same movie without leaving your house
Great job on trending @The Food Theorists
I got an ad of KFC on this video
I guess we know who to blame for the uncooked burgers from MrBeast burger...
Don't hug me I'm scared matpat

Mr beast does not use ghost kitchens. They use existing restaurants that have their own customer base.
A money laundry-
Are my ears deceiving me or at the very end did mat pronounce “bonappétit” correctly? Yay!
Everyone outside the U.S: understandable, have a nice day
they have a location that's just 2 miles too far away from me for any of the delivery apps to deliver to me ;-;
MrBeast is just a genius businessman but in the best way possible
Is it in Assam, because I live there, does it have dilivery❓
MrBeast Burger is actually delivered from Chuck E Cheese in CT. Neighborhood Wings is actually Applebee’s & Tyga Bites is delivered from Bertucci’s. Again, this is at least in CT. When ordering food, I ALWAYS check the address because so many of these little      “pop-up”or digital restaurants have been ALL over the place lately.
10:42   Fnaf special delivery is real now.
Genius
McDonald’s as a communist at 3:02
its for free
Jealous cause he has more money then u
Having Sushi while watching food theory. Nice.
Matt Pat looking at Fnaf special delivery very differently now       Joke is they deliver food to you if you didn’t get it
He’s just a hater

Boo
Every time Mat makes a FNAF reference, 5 years gets taken off my life.
buca de bippo is my mr beast burger
Wait Buca De Bepo is an ACUALL name of a restaurant?!
There are no Mr Beast ghost kitchens. They opened through existing restaurants, many of them struggling due to the pandemic). Wherever you get your burgers from, it's up to those restaurants to deliver the quality.
props to robert and robbie earl or anyone who's used this strategy before. It's an absolutely brilliant idea and probably already saved plenty of restaurants
The brand possesses the kitchen
so in other words theirs literally no difference between a beast burger and a bravo itallian kitchen burger. kinda ruins it tbh.
When are we going to see a Food Theory Pizzeria?
So they're basically dropshipping fast food?
So should I consider Jimmy as a business tycoon??????????????😂

i know this bc on doordash chili’s is also sometimes called “Just Wings”
This is so genius. I knew about rentable kitchens but this seems like a step ahead of that. that owner who owns all these kitchens must be swimming in cash rn
man, i like the idea of ghost kitchens, helping people out on the bills in these time, but like, its kind of scary to me! i dont see it being good in the long term? kind of feels like a cash grab. or i could just be worried for no reason *shrugs*
It seems that he had enough FOOD

This is basically the same as not wanting or being able to pay rent all by yourself and getting a roommate

Any one realizing mat pat's logo is starting to look like a simon. Makes you think hmm.
This so explains the signs at the curbside pickup at Bertucci's last night.  We don't ever use the third party apps, but I just checked Doordash and our local Bertucci;s is also doubling as Mr. Beast Burger / Mariah's Cookies / Tyga Bites.
Does the fnaf irl kitchen include all the well you know if you know
How to make Dump With PIN     Msr   Emv software   ATM hacking software   Blank card  Embosser    The msr is linked to the emv software and ATM hacking software when you are about to write the dumps with pin on a blank card.    Then  emv software makes the blanks card looks real and no one or machine  will be able to detect that it’s a clone card they will see it to be a  real card so no one can trace you or something. The emv software is a  software which protects the blank card and makes it look real. With that  no atm will be able to detect that the dumps with pin was written by  yourself but it’s will make it look like it was a card from the bank and  also  the emv software protects the card from any region block..without  the emv software it is 50% that your dumps with pin is gone work or not  but with the use of the emv software when the dumps with pin don’t work  meaning the dumps is not legit     The ATM HACKING SOFTWARE  helps you to breaks the limit of every ATM so you can cashout more than  the ATM limit without no notice.meaning you can cashout all the amount  in the card with the use of the atm hacking software     The blank card is what the dumps with pin is written on.    And the embosser is what write the numbers of the dumps with pin on the blank card. Understood    Msr for $50  Emv software for $100  ATM hacking software for $60  Embosser for $30  Blank card for $35$ for 200 pieces    That is the  price for all the equipment you will need to make a clone card.     Clone card is also for $60 depending on the balance you want and fedex guy who will bring it to your place       Meaning if the clone card will be done linking the emv software and atm hacking to the msr with the equipment listed above that will be the cost for it..Understood...The balance on the clone card is 10$k and above as same as the balance on the dumps with pin...When you order for the clone card and make cashout of all the balance at ones cuz the atm hacking is linked then you come back and order for the equipment with the some of the money cashed out from the clone card which was sent to you, after the equipment ordered for you just have to now order for just the dumps with pin and you will be taught how to make a clone card so that very will be simple for you    Johnnelltucker54@gmail.com
The giving away money part reminds me of that spongebob episode with the colorful krabby pattys.

Can you make a video about the Extreme Spicy Ramen Challenge? Please?
I got through most of this video without realizing "Bucca Di Beppo" refers to an actual business and wasn't a joke name to refer to any hypothetical chain.
That makes sense but I still order some still trust him he’s a nice guy
The chicken sandwich sucks, burgers are fine if a little burnt tasting, wait this isn't yelp
I'm just waiting for the inevitable MrBeast comment.
Wow, there's one of these a few blocks from here.

#1 Trending: I bought everything in 5 Stores - MrBeast #3 Trending: This video - MatPat
Why r u exposing the beast he’s doing this world good
Oh well i was just thinking of maybe seeing beast buger
Why are the replies being spammed with links from bots-
Video idea: Gogurt is an advertisement
I can't believe I have a Mr. Beast near me LOL I think this is awesome, but I didn't like it when Chuck E Cheese did it. That wasn't cool. 😠
What great grand uncle who was in the mafia died for mrbeast to inherit this much money???
Didn't Chuck E Cheese get in all kinds of trouble for starting up a hip chicken-wing ghost kitchen in early 2020?  I definitely recall people getting seriously ticked off about that...
MrBeast Burger is probably the most wholesome guy ever, he's also helping businesses that were badly damaged by the rona
NO
Bruh mr beast should doa giveaway through mr beast burger but beforw he does it make restaurants in europe as well so everyone has chances
I was wondering why 3 restaurants in my area had the same address. I contacted Uber & Doordash about it, no answer. I'm glad I saw this video. You're killing it MatPat.
intresting
Just once I wish MatPat could go one video without mentioning FNAF
MrBeast burger is actually very good
Its too birds in with one stone, you're safer and rich :)
Double beast burger, hold the onions, mustard, car, and oh yeah, hold the money... Thx
7:24 He told us: "This is isn't to diminish the launch of Mr. Beast Burger in any way." And proceeded to tell us how smart of a move it is to own ghost restaurants. However, he wasn't talking about Mr. Beast. He was referring to Robert Earl, subtly dodging a bullet.
who else thought that he was going to say that Mr. Beast was using humans or something for the food?
4:11-postmates and doordash. . . Grubhub:am I a joke to you
This is not a new idea, only for the food industry. Ever heard of Interflora or FastFlowers? Same thing. Except, florists hate them. We call then order gatherers because all they do is take an order and make someone else make it up. The truth is the business making it up gets very very little money. Think of the cute everyone is getting from an order where the customer is not paying a price higher than average. Order gatherers also do some seriously dodgy practices to get those orders over actual florists. I recommend googling the problem of order gatherers and having a read. I'm sure the food industry will easily see the same problems.
Somewhere in a business class "and that class is how to  own a restaurant" "sir Mr beast opened a free Burger restaurant"
How long can you hold a blizzard from Dairy Queen upside down
Cool intro
cool
Who is Mr. Beast?
It seems alot easier to make money when you already have tons of money. Hard to make money when your broke unless your working a nine to five

Why not?
why does that brown restaurant  image look like a minecraft villager
Would you consider doing a video on the YouTube series Epithet Erased? It's got 1 season out and plenty of mysteries!
here before MrBeast comments
Why you   he like gift his a good guy
Wanna Play A Game? Doñt look at my name
i personally am sick of these 3rd party delivery systems..... idk how things work globally but where i live if you are handling food at all you need a food handlers certificate. Not one of the delivery apps where i live require the drivers to have one, and i find this disgusting. Mat can you please do an episode on this, please its a serious thing even now more than ever with the virus all around us.
Am I the only one who looked to see if Mr beast commented?
Everyone already knew that this was done in ghost kitchens, like in Buca do Beppo kitchens. Everyone knows they aren’t brick and mortar locations, and that he partnered with restaurants. Ur late to the party.
Yay I can make a restaurant that has good drinks but bad food.
I love how Matpat just made the Christmas light video with mrbeast and now he made this video.
did he just say "guys and ghouls"
He literally saud something about this and I already know this (i think from reddit)
MatPat seems to really want that FNAF resteraunt huh?
Look at my name ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ ?! 👀 CMON LETS DO IT
He is awsome I wish some one would bless me with a car he has a giving heart and that's 1 in a million.
It's a dark kitchen???? Thanks internet explorer!
I just discovered food theory lol
4:31 i love how they put a pair of sun glasses on top of his sun glasses. ;)
THANK YOU! My 18yo and I were talking through Mr. Beast Burger, and I had the business model 98% correct just walking through what I knew. The Bertucci/Buca-connection threw me for a loop. I think this business model is genius, and I agree it is the future.
I chuckle slightly whenever Mat Pat says Buca Di Bepo
Ok nope I can't I thought we can give up but Mat stop killing my man in the sewer, his neck has suffered enough damage
You think MatPat wants a real life FNaF location because then detectives and journalists will have to figure out the confusing lore for him?
maya loves it https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/oh-my-ghost/season-6-pollyn-and-jacob-mirror-5/viewer?title_no=31313&episode_no=581
It's a smart business move :]
Yeah my dad works at Chile's as a manager and they have a ghost kitchen  with just wings
when matt said DTF..i thought this was turning into ah different video
Saludos gente hermosa y maravillosa ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I've been doing Doordash delivery for over 2 years now.  It's pretty neat and very lucrative.  I mean how many jobs can one name that don't require a college degree or the use of heavy machinery and pay an average of $20 an hour?
Me finding out that I have a MrBeast Burger, Mariah's Cookies, and Tyga Bites in my town through this video but they don't deliver to my address 🤣😶
Our Mr beast restaurant is buca d bepo and it's by far the worst burger I've ever eaten in my life. It was absolutely trash. In fact I'd have been better off eating trash.
“Alright, let’s see what to deliver next.... oh, another MrBeast Burgers order. What, I’ve had to deliver, like, 50 million orders?”
Reference - level video 👏👏👏
Now where's mrbeast comment?

He sources the burgers from BK and McDonald. So your overpaying for the burger. Shame on him.

I legitimately thought DTF stood for a down to franchise
Conclution is mrbeast is finding more ways to waste money
Hi
Remember: FNAF restaurant would be existing right now if there's no covid
It's not free. The prices are just in the negative integers
I’m going to open a restaurant called “Buca di Beppo”
Tech theory
This got 2 on trending but MrBeast's vid got 4 on trending lol

Matpat dream is like creating Five nights at Freddy's restaurants but more like in middle of Halloween they're like animatronics delivering pizzas to you
I bought from mrbeast burger from doordash twice Beast style burger and crinkle fries for $16.68
First Game Theory, then Film theory, now Food Theory.  Man, I can’t wait for the CONSPIRACY Theory YouTube Channel Matt’s going to create next!  you can like my channel
Thats just a foo.... wait did he just give me facts unacceptable
Food: exists Matpat on food theory: it’s that time of the day again isn’t it
Actually it's EXACTLY what I thought right after watching the MrBeast video. It took you guys a month to figure this out? LOL
everyone wins besides the cooks. still not getting paid enough and working harder
Gee thanks for telling us *EVERYTHING* we already knew from what MrBeast told us in his video & app. I’m so glad that this information was shared to the people who couldn’t even finish watching Beast video, least it got you views right? Should be happy that 61k would rather watch your video than understand what MrBeast had to say in his.
I got through the video but about halfway though it I realized. I just didn't care.  Sure he does good but the fact he's recording him throwing money at anything and everyone for more money to do it all over again just doesn't sit well with me. I don't find it entertaining and even though it's generous it feels detached and untruthful.

Brilliant!
It seems you believe that the Great reset is a good idea...
If a fnaf restaurant was really a thing it would be blooming
Matpat: Talks about Mr beast burger Kreekcraft fans: Hmmmmm
5:50 hey, that’s like, half an hour from my house! theorist who gave that info, reach out, i’m a fellow pittsburgh resident
*MrBeast theme song plays in my head continuously*
This felt a lot less like any kind of theory episode and lot more like paid advertising. You basically just boasted the ins-and-outs of Mr Beast and other stars exploiting their popularity for another avenue of income that takes advantage of the situation we're in. Great way to turn things around for those restaurants/businesses while building new streams of revenue, but this was basically a commercial.
The Burger is a lie
Funny video👏
Bro mrbeast burger was way better then I was expecting ngl
Maybe the real Mr. Beast Burger was the friends made along the way...
I thought buga di bepo was a fake restaurant lol XD
Everyone except the people who lost their life savings because a smart guy in government says that protests are good for the pandemic and selling food in a restaurant is bad for the pandemic. Pathetic
I ordered from there and I went to the “location” to just check it out but it wasn’t there... it was only a bbq place.. 🤔
why do you have so many channels combind it all in to one
Yeah  I know .
you best be wrong
So... when are we getting the MattPatt Burger?
I didn’t know this was as a channel
Then again... I have eaten from the other kind of ghost restaurant. One that actually never existed. Back in college, several of us were pitching together on a house off campus. One day, there was this door hanger for "Roller Chicken" - Delivery fried chicken. Logo was a chicken on roller skates.  Cool! we thought. We scrabbled together our loose bills and change, counted up enough for an order and tip, and called it in. Food was delivered, it was delicious! and we were a happy pack of college students. Few days later. We decided to get another order. We called the number. The exact words have been forgotten (this was over 30 years ago) but essentially went like: "We'd like to place an order." "I'm sorry we're not open yet." "OK, we'll call back later tonight, at what time do you open?" "You misunderstand. We haven't opened for business yet. We'll be opening next week. --- How did you get our number?" "We have this door hanger." "OK those shouldn't have gone out yet." "OK, we'll call next week."   Bunch of confused students we were, but we reasoned they must have been having some sort of training soft open when we called before and that they just went ahead and delivered food they were practicing on. So a week goes by, and none of us can forget the chicken. It was gooood. So, after plenty of time, we called again. No answer. We tried again a couple days later, no answer. Finally one of us went by the address. Closed up, not even a sign for the business. It never opened. We had dinner from a restaurant that technically never opened.
Did... Did I just get an Uber eat add?
i do not kare what you say im getting mr beast burgers rite now
I like how the video time was 11:11
I never though food theory would work, but matpat makes it great
Sometime in 2023: Scott creates "Freddy's Pizza", and you can order pizza and other foods via delivery.
International Mr beast burger next? Probably in Asia? Maybe?
Yo Mr beast us Canadians need money too!😭
I love he added glasses to the glasses
I started watching this video, but after about a minute and 30 seconds I had to stop because of that annoying narration. What a whiny voice!
Still even the nicest man in the world doesn’t care about vegans no one likes us :(
Kinda hungry now
imma just fnaf theory channel we need it at this point
This makes me so sad because Bravo was in my city and it closed this past summer... I could have had Mr. Beast Burgers 10 min away from me ;-;
Kevin?

congrats on #1 on trending mat :)  love your theories keep it up
Is Karl’s grilled cheese good? Lookin at the menu, might get one tomorrow
Mr beast sounds like a nice guy
k sure
i knew this from day one, i ordered the same day he posted the video and my door dasher said they were taking forever at a restaurant called Bertuccis
Not gonna lie mrbeast is a genius
It is real my sister and her friend got one and they loved it
Hold on a sec, you mean it tell me it's NOT Mr. Beast himself cooking up every single burger! OUTRAGEOUS!
Before watching the video, I only looked at the title and I thought he was gonna theory the food itself that it’s “not what you think” and I was like “uh oh”
It's just too bad some locations can't get delivery because it's outside the city limits and a lot of the services like doordash is not available in your area
1:51, 6:46 Wow, this is truly a _master_ of foreshadowing.
it is also just such a good think because that means that the kitchen staff wont loose their job in the hard time of no dine in restaurants which is awesome
They should put a mind blown button beside the Like Button.   Thanks MatPat!!! My brain was trembling while listening to this out of sheer excitement at the thought of how I could use this concept.
I searched up Tyga Bites and searched the address and its literally a Buca di Beppo!
Figured this was the case when I got curious and googled the address of my closest  "Mrbeast Burger" on launch day. Unsurprisingly, to those who watched this video, it is a Buco di Beppo.
"guys and Ghouls"  MatPat, 2021
mr.beast food i free isn't it
Only ogs remember mr beast from 7 years ago
Idk if you will read this, but according to mr beasts manager he doesn’t use ghost kitchens, he uses small restaurants that need money during the pandemic. Same idea, different kind of restaurant
Ya none of those fake restaurants exist near me
This is a really good idea. It secures jobs.
Thats why most People have mixed critics with the burger
The fact that my brain went from Sister BRAND to Sister LOCATION is having worried about the Game theory videos...wait does that make Film Theory AND Food Theory Sister Locations of Game theory?!
HOW DARE YOU MAT PAT YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR!!!!!!
Isn't the problem that, if he were to expand to other chains, then there would be consistency issues?
Mrbeast must have been planning this for a long time now.
Great Video Matpat!
Do “ClusterTruck.”
🤯
I wonder what Gordon Ramsay thinks of this
The one major issue with this sales market is a lack of tips for the staff
Too bad none of Grubhub like apps don’t deliver to Rogersville Mo
Dang, love to try a Jimmy burger but I dont do delivery apps. I might have to look in to it at least once if a location becomes available around my area.
It's like the Netflix of fast food
I’m what’s next the ultimate Or KINDA BAD WORKOUT THEORY
Something about matpat saying Buco Debepo is very satisfying to me.
POV: your mrbeast about to comment
i love the way he a says bucca de beppo
Ahh, MatPat, family friendly content that teaches us how to rule the world Theory by Theory 😎
Hey, when can I get my THEORY BURGER? I want to have my meal delivered with a small pamphlet of KNOWLEDGE.
I’m literally getting mr beast burger delivered rite NOW! In Austin TX let’s goooooo woooo!!!!! I got a beast burger my son got the Chandler and my wife got the Chris burger lol ...
I wouldn’t be surprised if Freddy’s Pizzaria became an actual thing.
Why is no one talking about Buca di BEPPO?  I love their lasaga-spagehtt dish.
You know, this is a pretty great idea to potentially use commercial kitchen space to start creating your own delivery style restaurant.
Here a theory for you.  Where does mr. beast  get his endless amounts of $$$?
Long story short: never trust a capitalist.  Also, drivers are abused by those services.  Don't act like they are part of that "win".  Being shoved into 1099 status (zero benefits) and having to cover vehicle maintenance yourself plus the pittiful wage means it is a win for the company as they shift business costs to their employees through savings.  Does anyone else think this is a terrible idea?  It's gonna be nothing but branded restaurants and zero local.  Look at Walmart and Amazon if you think that's a good idea.  If you think this will save local restaurant you're wrong.  The money and speed and infrastructure large companies can throw at celebrities will lure them away from the single location businesses.
I learned a new place buck I’d i peoeprovj Fa u ex soo I be  in ex something
My dude is gonna infamintate the country
I love the idea of minimal dine in restaurants, because I am such a picky eater and my orders are always weird and specific. But also I live in the middle of no where and no one will deliver here.
I'm from the UK so for me the delivery services are Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat. So you referring to companies like Door Dash feels just wierd.
Here are 3 things that are almost impossible to happen Queen Elizabeth dying, MrBeast not giving money And lastly Matt Patt making a bad video
Watching this when it's 5 hours old.
Thanks for this information, i will now go harass mrbeast because of this
I would so eat fnaf pizza
Do not buy the burger. @Dad provides the FOOD. FOOD gives you the nourishment. Order your can of FOOD today
0:00 every rich person in comic books
Matpat says something bad about MrBeast  The entire comment section: “so you have chosen death”
Honestly so confused bc there’s a real pizzeria kitchen in my area called pasquallys and it’s a real restaurant and there’s like 4 different delivery only restaurants in my area and I live in the middle of nowhere 😁 scared
Let’s hope he doesn’t get sued for exposing them
I watched the first half of this video as background noise on my drive home and I thought MatPat was really trashing Beast Burgers food quality then never addressing it again.
Since this channel began, the fact that the burger on the MatDonald's window in the intro isn't a "Matty Patty" has bothered me immensely.
First Markapiler is not real now this is not real........Coinicidence?
9:54 Have you heard of sister location
I have a theory, Mr. Beast works for YouTube and is supplied, pretty smart, YouTube paying YouTube, and being paid back in double by YouTube.
Matpat: Fnaf sister brand Fnaf sister location: Am i a joke to you?
I am yet waiting on the Markis not real thery on matts channels
you should make a video where u figure out if cannibalism is a healthy diet
When you get the snoop dog Menulog add at the start of food theory
Umm In-N-Out has 362 locations and is 73 years old
👏👏👏
Stop dissing beast dude
I already new this lol from a different video
About what you said with the stigma around delivery and restaurants  It does obviously depend on what country you're inbecause in Australia at the moment we don't need to wear masks (besides one state that's under communist lockdown) I've been to restaurants plenty of times during the pandemic and even going in to a fast food chain instead of using the drive-thru
So I was definitely paying attention but I'm pretty sure the part that's going to stick with me most is that there's an actual food chain called Boopa de Bepi's.
bet it is
I- money
Together let’s take this video down
Why would it give ONLY delivery thats bull
Do you agree Mr. beast fans?
Don’t mess with Mr. beast
This channel should be called food facts.
Bruhify
Matpat: *Mentions Maria Carrie* Me: *Shivers*
3:32 Peter griffin speaking italian:
die mcdonalds
I already knew this
After all the things i saw the past days i can say: americans are strange....
No one: Me in the uk: cries* I can't get anythiiiiiiiing              Sips tea*
Mrbeast did say that in the vid right? Like... Right?  Coz I remember him specifically saying like all of the things that was talked about in this vid. Or I might be tripping.
FINE!! I'll watch it YouTube are you happy huh!!! Or maybe It's when I got the notification I added it to my watch later
It is a clever business model...just saying
Buca di beppo is fun to say
My dad runs a brio in Delaware, he’s been rolling out all of the celebrity ghost kitchen lineups! I can’t even begin to explain my excitement when I watched this video and showed it to him. This is so surreal hearing my favorite youtuber talking about something that is happening in my life!
The Matpat Diet coke, Branded Coke Diet is coming Soon,....... Right?
"PaulyD is totally DTF........ Delivering the Food" Bruh, I expected something more. 😂
Making a simple business decision is never that simple.
do you think mr.beast would give me some money if I were to ask him politely?
How was this a theory?
So buca di beppo is a real restaurant?
How much money does this dude have. The dude is using Andrew Carnegie's Gospel of Wealth but supercharged.
So dad didn't get you lol
I’ve been waiting for a Theory like this.
My foots asleep
Who else thinks Scott should make one but for five nights at Freddy's
New theory MatPat was paid by MrBeast to make him look good  by making this video
MrBeast Burger meme edition with even more Jimmy Generousity
Mr beast is speed running 300 resrtouam in 1 day
I haven’t had one yet
Question: do I get paid to buy a burger
hey before any of you mrbeast fans get angry make a hateful comment please listen to what mat pat says
Anyone who wasted money on Mr. Beast food should demand a refund. He is a total, MEGA "DB".
Not gonna lie I saw the hub on that phone half way through the video and got scared...
I want a theorist burger.
Do something with what markiplier is doing right now please!
if McDonald's went god mode...
ITS A SANDWHICH
11:11 make a wish!
I love matpat and his fnaf theories but like, you don't gotta mention it on every channel man😂
His kids will be mad af if they get no inheritance because he died with $0
I want to eat the beast burger 🍔!!!!
it hurts a little that im still so rural theres not mr beast here. Lets get eastern NC some love
me who has only 10 subs  Me: Ok time to make a resteron
Hmm Very insightful
The other day I wanted to eat Chinese food, I looked up some Chinese restaurants on the food delivery app (Rappi) and 3 of those restaurants had the same pictures on all the menu items 🙄 2 of those restaurants had the same price on all the items and the 3rd one was more expensive, the 3 of them had the same address... I looked it up on Google maps and it was a very run down house (maybe a haunted ghost kitchen) and no restaurants near the location... It seemed very fishy and none of the 3 places had a rating over 3 out of 5 stars... I ended up ordering from McDonald's
The closest mrbeast burger to me is over 500 miles away or a 7 and a half hour drive.
I challenge you to prove that one of the family members from full house is evil! like of you agree!
Theory
This is an absolutely terrible idea! Yes of course it solves a short term problem but it most certainly comes with its share of long term repercussions. It will completely destroyed the cultural and economic diversity in the dining industry. Stealing business from the many and giving it to the few further deepening the wealth gap and fueling an unfair, uncompetitive, oligarchic system. Stupid ideas like these are truly killing free market capitalism and I fear for this country’s future.
6:45 i legitimatelly thought that Buca di beppo was just a matpat italian joke in a family guy style at first.
Digital foot court.
Just like mark not real
I really enjoyed this video, but what is the actual "theory"? It's just a bunch of facts
Ha! He made the burger taste bad because it's mr. beast! He made it seem like 100$ bills are worthless and he has more loss than gain but is still happy! Thats a good joke!
“make fnaf real and not just a matpat fantasy“  *and we thought William Afton was the one behind it all*
He is slowly but surely taking over the world
Ok  so I checked to see if it was true here’s how I did it: 1. Search mrbeast burgers in to maps 2.then look at the address closely or copy and paste it  3.then search one of the 4 restaurants pat mentioned  4. Serch 1 if the restaurants 5.notice they have the same location     That’s the tea sis
I thought u were gonna say it was a money laundering buisness
From wiping your mouth with 100$ to eating a Mr. Beast burger.... The burger was the biggest waste of money.
I was waiting for the so we are making are own restraints coming soon
Ugh. I hate the plot of Ghost Kitchens. It feels so icky to trick people who want to support small businesses into just unknowingly just paying massive chain restaurants. A lot of local restaurants in my area either closed permanently or had to stop using delivery apps because they’re losing too much money. It’s all sad.
What's your backstory totally not asking for Dad or anything heh heh...
I kinda don’t believe this
dad: you will now join me  matpat: *eats actual ood because he has a whole channel based on that*  dad:oh *dances in sadness*
Any one else going to talk about dadbot giving mat pat the FOOD, after his last film theory?
As a chef I hate ghost kitchens, probably just a personal thing, but having one location cranking out a wide variety of cuisines makes for less quality on the food. Also it would seem that, up here in canada atleast, all of them are owned by a handful of companies, so while it may be named a different resturant, all of its profit goes to the same people. Ghost kitchens are great for helping small buisness owners stay open despite loss in sales, but suddenly they are creating compition in their own resturant. As well in my city we still have resturants shutting down, these ghost kitchens aren't helping keep them open, but are rather waiting until the location is up for sale, then swooping in so they can keep sole profit off their work
When I read the title I thought Matpat was going to say the meat was fake or something
The craziest part is how Virtual Dining Concepts seemingly only has one “restaurant” for each cuisine type, like what was discussed in the episode about what counts as a sandwich with how mall food courts work. Earl doesn’t serve any competing Italian brands, and each celebrity brand is their own thing. Basic business, crazy cool
hey uh, maybe check around the corner of your house... there's a camera...
I can see a lot of positives to this new system being set up, which can help hold up kitchens in tough times like this and could serve as a buffer for a lot of struggling people in that particular field. My only concern is that the quality (Both health and taste) of the food you'd get from MrBeast Burgers and companies of the like are more significantly affected by region. So if you travel, and try to use these restaurants, you're liable to get significant quality variation over time.
I hope fnaf vids are soon
I saw people getting so mad on twitter because it is a ghost kitchen
Next we’ll see a game theory virtual restaurant that’s a collaboration with FNAF to bring us mediocre pizza
I hope that mr beast burger becomes international. I’m Aussie and want to see what the burgers are like 😥
Mr Beast figured out how to drop ship food and I’m in awe. Wow. Just wow. 🍔
I actually was not familiar with virtual kitchens until I started doordash. I'd have to do doubletakes to see if I'm getting food at the right place since they seem different to be from the same area.  NOPE just the same very minimalist kitchen. I find it quite nice actually, very interesting and unique.
This isn’t directly related but Mr Beast went to a McDonald’s in Greenville NC and gave every employee 1000 dollars and then went to another one owned by the same person and ordered a number 9 and took one pictures and sat in the lobby to eat.
Just curious: Anyone who's actually eaten a Mrbeast burger, how good are they?
there is a real fnaf resturant, its just less spooky.
I just wish mr beast burger was in canada
Bro says the guy how was in mr beast video
Markiplier: I am not real Matpat: Mr. Beast Burger is not real  I'm kinda seeing a pattern 2021 I'm on to you
I didn't know all this, thanks matpat
What's up with all those Restaurants starting with a B??
I loved this episode but can you do more of the scientific theories you used to be known for. Your old videos were basically carrying my scientific knowledge
MatPat: Points to McDonalds as a restaurant. Also MatPat: why McDonalds isn’t a restaurant.
Food Theory: the Restaurant
I have one 11 miles from me and it’s “not in the delivery zone” that’s fucking bullshit
*cries in not america*
Bobo
I have never heard of any of these italian restaraunts
Man when I saw the south Florida location I got exited. Then I saw that it was closer to the north than south U.U.
I just now noticed the stay puft marshmallow man in the opening theme intro. It’s amazing how many things just zip by
woah.
I decided to look up Mrbeast burger and under the people also ask bit the first question was what disease does Mrbeast have so I got curious and clicked on it and I saw it said he had Crohn's disease and I started crying because I have ulcerative colitis and learning he has the worse version made me cry ive only heard of 3 people who have it and ive...a teacher I had, someone in a twitter comment section, and now mrbeast....im sure theres a lot of people with it but it's hardly talked about
I bought it tasted like road house burgers I’m not even joking lmao great food.
I hope that mr.beast burger opened around the world
ME: living in germany will never eat Mr Beast's Burger and its in the middle in the night and im hungry now...
6:40 My man really likes his restaurant chains to start with B
Watching the intro at 50% speed is great not the eating the burger bit but after that
I hate “he who shall not be named” due to this i have cash and throwing it to the wind type scenarios
Mr Beast is a whole new breed
Yeah it is a ghost kitchen plenty of companies do this, typically it is done on a smaller scale however. Most of the time larger companies do this to test new brands.
is there one in detroit i want to get some as a way of getting food and indirectly giving to charity
Scott Cawthon should definitely hop on that train.
hum, now how to get those
Scott is gonna watch this and gonna get ideas!
Whenever he said napkins in the very beginning I was laughing because I didn’t even get any napkins
I cant believe he went from making fun of kids intros to this
Been watching all your theory videos for some time now, And I have one burning question- Who is that "random guy" that you use as clipart in your videos? I already know that "random gal" is Matt's wife, but the guy I've been hung up on.....
You know, Scott Cawthon COULD actually do that. I mean, if it’s that simple, he could do it as a pre-launch advertisement for his next games. Plus he’d totally use it for lore reveals. “So the pepperoni pizza needs to have exactly 57 pepperoni because that’s how old Afton was when he killed Crying Child.”
I can't wait for the Theorist Kitchen
So hes complaining about mrbeast giving away thousands of dollars?            I agree.
Me for no reason: Out standing move
Matpat is slowly becoming a commentary channel
Alright, screw it. I'm going to start my own horror-themed fast-food chain called "Ghost Kitchen".
Seems like robert is the real winner in this
I want to be rich
Are you going to buy chucky cheese  any time soon.
It’s almost like restaurants now have their own gig economy.
Am I The Only One Who Thought MrBeast's Move Is One Of The Best Business Moves
Imagine getting a heart ❤️!
my mom used to work at bravo cool
I know this is slightly on and off topic, but does anyone else have trouble when it comes to delivery apps, I do go through mostly all of them at one time or another, and a lot of times the order is wrong, something as small as onions still on the burger, to items completely missing, i know they can not look in the bag to check if everything is there or not, so I am not too sure why this happens, is it just a Cali problem or other people around the world have this problem? It seems to only be problems with third party delivery services, not when i order straight from the place it self too
We need a Food Theory restaurant
I like the idea of these fast food chain's  prepared in other restaurants, because unlike the service at certain fast food places like McDonalds, the foods being prepared in actual restaurants, and restaurants really have to know how to treat their customers, which means there's a chance of higher quality food. This may be the new way to do fast food.
so it is, technically, a restaurant that only exists digitally
I didn't get know mrbeast burger but I wish I have one.
when your not american : depressed flute noises
I love how he called McDonalds a restaurant
Mrbeast disliked this video
"Five Night's at Freddy's Sister Brand"  Sister Location: ExCuSe mE
My kfc closed
Ima be honest here. I have never heard of the business Buca De Beppo and I 100% thought he just made up that name for the first example.
Wtf you mean it ain’t real! Btw haven’t watched it yet
Now we have the new team Jollibee Mcdonalds KFC Burger King Wendys Arbys Taco Bell MrBeast Burger Buca De Bepo Who Will Win??
The way these are set up reminds me the same way Spirit Halloween springs up at random store locations every Halloween then vanishes soon after till next year
yes mat open up real fnaf pizzerias and then wait for the death of fie kids only to have an employee that looks like a zombie to leave without warning
That happened in southlake?! Aw man I had no idea
So when are we going to eat the Matpattie, mat nugs, mat fries, Mat
how does Mr. Beast give away so much money and luxury items?? what does he even do??
You should do how Steve is in a simulation (from Minecraft
I like ur vids but me beaetcis to far he is just trying to change the world and help people so stop me beast is better than u and ur just mad
Me waiting for Mr.Beast to respond to this in the comment section:👁👄👁
What's the coincidence MatPatt a youtuber made a food channel and Mr. Beast, also a youtuber launched his own restaurant chain 😳
Yo I get DoorDash from this one place that’s been around for a few months now that is called it’s just wings and it’s amazing but I can’t find them anywhere and that’s because it’s coming from Chili’s and it is the idea of the overarching company that owns this chain as well as other chain restaurants.
Pa-squall-ee
“The food Theorists” feels like the YouTube version of food fact or fiction lol
9:09 you'll get your rent whEN YOU FIX THIS F*CKING DOOR
Neat
mr.beast made this for fun  food theory yea right u bum
Me watching this in europe and knowing that mrbeast burger is only in america be like: PAIN
When can i buy a Theory Burger?
LAST
I would travel across the country to go to FNAF irl
If you're savy you can identify new "restaurants" on delivery apps that are operating from ghost kitchens, or are sister brands to chains that operate from the same building. For example, there's one called "It's Just Wings" which is just Chili's, and you can tell based on the location and the item types and flavors on the menu. Often the items are similar
If 2021 is really a better year, then FNAF will become real
Mr. beast when he sees this: 0-0 I gave people over 5k grands and whole island.
Man that opening was a straight up dis to mrbeast.  Also, impressive goal. To die with zero dollars in his bank account. I wonder how he'll do it.  Oh, one last thing! How will the FDA react to this? If they already have, what was their reaction? What new rules will be put in place for ghost kitchens?
This is basically a Ghost Writer situation
That could also explain why the food quality was so terrible
He could rule the world if he wanted
Saw this after a mr.beast video coinsidence i think not
yknow, as someone who knows alot about food stuff and is learning for this channel you could open up probably the best fastfood chain avalible
For real...this channel is just the absolute best.
Boy
Glad to see that Generic Man own his own restaurant now.
When he lists all the restaurants one guy manages all over the nation and you've never heard of any of them, you know you live in the middle of nowhere.
That’s actually an amazing idea if MrBeast partnered with small businesses that are being screwed by COVID
Not going there
I'm from  California mr.beast burger  shows up as fosters Freeze .
Matt you make more five nights at freddy's references then you do actually making fnaf theories
Am I... am I so old at 33 that I have no idea who Mr Beast is ?! And also, being America. Won’t this go down the Oprah route and the people receiving these “Prizes” will get screwed by the taxman ?
4:32 Ah yes. MrBeast wearing glasses on top of his glasses.
Yeeeeeee
I was ordering food and I saw Mr Beast Burger and I screamed because I was so confused and shocked-
In n out is a bad comparison as they don't franchise out if you aren't family
So... Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria could become a real restaurant easily?
Oh lord.... Blackmirror warned us about this
4:32 bruh he put glasses on mr beasts glasses lol
in asian if you didn't do delivery you aren't main stream S Korea is the best at this too. Cheap too.
Theorist Kitchens; a restaurant that sells 100% scientifically healthy food that is disguised as junk food. Like pizzas and burgers as an example.  and a question of the day for people that want a 50% discount has to solve. LEARN WHILE YOU EAT CHALLENGE!
HOLY CRAP this explains so much about the restaurants in my town
Game Theory  Film Theory  Food Theory  Conspiracy Theory?
This fool! I doubt he actually knows what paper tastes like. I do.
how dare you disrespect mrbeast
5,000th comment!
Had one delivering near me and I just had to see the location.  So I drove there and that's how I discovered it was a ghost kitchen.  Applebee's has also been doing one for their wings
Sad. He didn't mention Moobys 😓
I don’t think The algorithm likes conspiracy theories, but that’s just a theory A CON- nvm
the burgers are good, but the fries are where it's at!
I love the way he says buca di beppo
I didn’t know that ghost kitchens existed, this blows my mind. If mr. beast was calculated enough, maybe part of his intention for opening up this food chain is to help struggling restaurants during this pandemic. That is honestly really cool.
I'm surprised this episode is in dark like Mr. Beast Burgers is serving you poison knowing him
I was hoping to see @MrBeast in the comments 😓😂😂😞😋😋
I looked up all those places, I live in Detroit, MI and none of them exist around here
Why do I feel like we will see "FOOD by DAD" popping up in 31 days...
You always blow my mind great video
Are we getting a food, gaming and movie themed ghost kitchen a la MatPat? The Theorist Restaurant.
"guys and ghouls" yes I am a ghoul
Honestly, I'm kinda starting to prefer food theory over the other theory channels. Not even that sure why. Anyone else feel like that?
When your new year's resolution is to eat less and healthier, but then you watch food therorie 🤤😭
It’s not safer than in person.  Your chances of catching something from a restaurant is slim to none
I would worry about food quality and the workers. Cooking food from 3 different menus sounds extremely stressful. I dont really want an Italian maestro cooking my French food.
Eyyyy, Matpat coming to us in these trying times with a new theory!
Mr. Patrick what were you on when you made this didn’t you just collab with him.
I don’t live in America.....         Truely sad
What a waste of money wait I thought they were free
Ok voy a copiar este sistema en México pero no le digan a nadie.
Mr beast has done more to give to people than the US government
Then who really owns mr beast burgers Mr beast or the owner of the Ghost kitcken
I love food theory seeds
Do a theory on cloudy with a chance of meatballs!   Like so MatPat can see this
Mr beast throwing money at something does more than political meetings for the economy
It was at this moment that mr beast... reinvented the entire restaurant Competitive singles meta
How dare you autoplay as an ad!!!
I thought mat pat will say something like "mr. Beast burger is a restaurant with bad burger disquise as a popular burger restaurant"
I paused at 7:15 and found out that the menu has Karl's name spelled wrong. Friccin hecc.
...............
Ya but how dose it taste???
I can’t be the only one who thought he was going to say that it was actually a bank or something cause me beast has way to much money😂
Mr beast is gamer raging right now
And there I thought the end of the video would've launched the Theorists (Virtual) Restaurant
Once newbies start taking a chunk out of big corporations money like McDonald's or Burger King or whoever can pay off the government to make stuff illegal well then they'll stop making that money. tell Mr beast enjoy it while it lasts because new money never lasts long in an old money's country.
Never heard of this, it's really cool! I'mma check if I can order some in my area and hopefully help a local business.
I've never actually had delivery........is that weird?
So are all these ghost kitchens getting the same ingredients like burger meat or is a mr beast burger totally different depending on where you order from?
10:42 anyone else notice Chica was starting to follow him very slowly?
I love all the food theory videos, some aren't really theories but they're educational and relevant and I get the vibe that MatPat wanted to spread word about Mr. Beast's restaurant
No locations in Maine 😞
Nice to c u in mr beasts rewind this year
Is mrbeast burgers in australia?
I like how often MatPat keeps trying to drop hints to Scott Cawthon that he wants to create fnaf themed places in real life
I read the title as “Breasts Burger” 😗
Wait I didn't know MrBeast Burger was a real thing you could order from! I thought it was just that one off video he did, that's pretty cool if there's a location near me maybe I'll give it a try because it's MrBeast I have to.
I was wondering why he opened up so many so fast lol
Because he’s god.
That’s not what a ghost kitchen - they are kitchens where there is no dining at all
I’m just I- confusion noises?! shooketh doesn’t even begin to describe the feeling I’m having right now lmao
I just saw an ad on Facebook for free delivery from a Mr Beast Burger near me. I thought at first that it must be a joke, but then I remembered that I saw that Food Theory had posted a video related to Mr Beast today. One watch later and now there's a burger on the way here from a Mr Beast Burger that is secretly also a Bravo. Thanks for the fact check, Matt Pat!
You should do a video about if Epic Meal Time’s calorie counter was accurate
Matpat can you start your own reataurant where there's creepy animatronics
I'm sure anyone trying to profit off of Mr. Beast's success will try to be as controversial as they can be...
this is how many people hated this nonesence
Yum
i think ghost kitchens are a bit dishonest. I have seen them pop up where i live and i have to google the address to find out some chinese place is serving fried chicken as a whole other name gives me concerns for health food quality and overall care put into it. I frankly would not trust a ghost kitchen ever because it just feels a lot less safe and more dishonest if your not upfront about it.
That's also a good way to save existing businesses and jobs! I love it!
As an army vet I sure could use that Mr. Beast money lol
your making everryone look evil  but why someone who gives away million$ a week
WE ALL NEED TO BECOME BRAND DESIGNERS *RIGHT NOW.*
I searched on Uber eats in Minneapolis for all three of those, and all three were delivered from a Buca di Beppo. No Pauly D's in my area though
ngl, I thought Matpat was joking when he said buca di beppo
FNAF could be real
Here I am, stuck down under while you guys are being given free money and Ipads!
I’d love to here on how Tamato soup can stop a skunk funk
Last
We have game, movie, food theory. What’s next FALSE THEORY LOL
SERIOUSLY MATPAT? YOU DO A WHOLE EPISODE ON GHOST KITCHEN THE VERY NEXT DAY FROM WHEN THE VIEGO PLOTLINE GETS KICKSTARTED? RUNETERRA NEEDS A THEORY, MATPAT! NOW YOU'RE JUST TEASING ME! (PS: I know you probably have been working on this for a lot longer and that the thematic release is a coincidance, but I have to sell the bit. Just like Runeterra needs a theory.)
This is terrible, poorly rated restaurants can slip under the radar this way.
Yea cool! , however, they dont show the carbs or the calories, n im a diabetic, i cant just risk my health
They don't deliver to my house
“Buca de Bepo “ what can I say smh what a joke lmlol ( cause I use too work there, one of my first jobs 🙌🏽  ijs ) but I love you Matt patt hope the family is well..
Peladophobian shoulda made this vid lol
As much of a an outsource job like da travis scott burga celeb marketang.
Now it should be F.O.O.D Theory
I never buy from the ghost kitchen on doordash or Uber eats. Seems too sketchy if they don't actually exist
Is it possible to make a three course without turning into a blueberry
What a waste of money XD
there's a not a single mrbeast burger in my state
i felt nice today so i didnt skip the ads
I can’t wait for Mrbeast to comment here
ur opinion no one cares we all  have our own taste  bugs not all like yours idc
really
Food theorists mr beast burger is not meant to be good burgers they give way money
Dat Intro alone...
This is just the "next level" of those failed multi-brand restaurants that tried to pair such greats as KFC and Taco Bell together in one place... but now it's not so obvious.
I like you run a business and stop judging other places
I really want a mr beast burger but I’m in the uk
What the heck is a Mr Beast Restrunt.
It's probably the best thing since slice bread, but to me for no good reason feels cheap that celebrities do this, no reason why I feel like that just do.
Coming summer 2021: Freddy FastBear's Burgeria
Omg omg hes talking about my state
Indy has 3 locations
when im watching this the dislike is at 666 lmao
Five nights at Freddy's sister brand...  It does have a nice ring to it.
I was honestly surprised that Buca de Bepo was not a fake name
so basically MatPat explains a three minute topic in eleven minutes
no one thought it was a real resturant
I'm sooooo thicc
Me coming into this video thinking that MatPat was about to say how Jimmy is doing his restaurant wrong.  Came out with a better understanding of how ghost kitchens work and a bigger hate for Jersey Shore.  Thanks Mat, keep up the good work.
The map shown at 2:03 dose not have a mrbeast burger location in Alaska. We Alaskans don’t get any MrBeast Burgers.
I'm exsited for fnaf pizza
mr beast give money
MrBeast: opens 300 restaurant across the U.S. Me: *Sad other country noises
Early
I saw this one coming a month ago
All I heard from this video is that MatPat is going to open a ghost kitchen ‘fight nights at Freddie’s’
I have never gotten anything from Uber eats or anything like that- only at the beach- it’s just not popular where I am
How was the FOOD?
0:58 I recieve 183 daily by having this right here *f u n d a i l y p a y*
Why is this the second cameo MrBeast has made in your vids
Does it really work though? I can't imagine the food from a place that has no specialization work well. Imagine getting a spaghetti from a place that also, bakes cookies, fries chicken, makes burgers and makes subs. Sure people will buy from it once for the memes but once they realize they are better of getting a doordash or ubereats for McDonalds or an other fast food chain that actually specializes in that kind of food the marketing ploy of a famous person attached to it is quickly over.
Dang I just looked it up and there are no locations where in the state I live
It’s 11:11 long. Make a wish!
Yeah, given how the introduction of all these third party delivery services has created tens of thousands of jobs delivering food from places that could never afford their own delivery, and bring in extra business for those stores, they aren't going anywhere for a long time.
All because of capitalism.  Huh
Jesus Christ if Scott Cawthon actually uses these ghost kitchens to launch a for real Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, I'm pretty sure the internet will just eat itself
Mathew Pathew
I see Scott taking notes.
I'm guessing that there will be new channels called "Music Theory", "Life Theory", etc. 😂  Edit: maybe even "Tech Theory"
the only problem about this technique that i can think of is like what if one of the workers has asymptomatic corona and he, unknowingly, gives it to literally ALL the food from ALL those different restaurants that he prepares? 4x the restaurants, 4x the deliveries, 4x the food output, 4x the corona spreading.  yikers
Question is how does ghost restaurants affect food quality?
That bravo you mention is 15 minutes from my house
The traffic was almost as bad as the In ‘n Out in Colorado
I'll tell you what I am struggling with this one, because I really love the idea of charity and giving and helping other people especially during this effed up pandemic. The problem I have is that I for the most part I hate influencers and I really despise these kinds of stunts, these hollow gestures. And as someone who loves food I hate the idea of a virtual restaurant which is a new entity and seeks to make money off of other people's needs like a restaurant with employees and no customers, and I also hate the idea of them not having original dishes. If I want something from buca di beppo I would just try to find out if they had online ordering. It might be a brilliant idea and it's probably only good for the short term. Because most of these restaurants by now know that they need to adapt to have some kind of online ordering and it's only a matter of time before they do and then I won't need to try Mr beesburger just because I'm a fan or enjoy the brand if I want buca di beppo or something else I'll know that they have their own app on that they do have some kind of online ordering
watching these videos makes me hungry, but my country lives in the technological stoneage and we only have two national delivery apps and they both only operate in a small radius. I can't even get food from a KFC the next city over, which would be a 20minute drive tops, while in China they deliver food that takes over an hour to get to your location. And in China one city covers the same area as 4-6 cities here
It's real what are you talking about this is just a waste of your time
How tf does he have so much money o.O
Not gonna lie, I’ve never heard of any of these restaurants Matt listed
It's basically the same concept of celebrity generic merch. There's the company with factories all over the world capable of producing the same t-shirts, mugs and prints on demand with the designs of anyone capable of getting people to buy them, and by having the locations everywhere they can supply the final client at competitive prices.
As soon as he uploads about food old mat will go break opinions of mr beast
Make another channel so you can have all four parts of the xbox player counter thing
Wait haven’t we scene this shadow restaurants with Chuck E. Cheese? (I take back what I asked I didn’t finish the video)
i wonder if australia will get a MrBeast Burgurs
i he wouldn't spend his money jeff besos would be in the cry corner
Mr beast is the best socialist.
Ur cool
Hi
You have to love how the gullibility of the general populace is so much easier to profit off of. TV tells them to jump, and they say how high, quivering in unfounded fear.
I first read this as “MrBeast Is NOT What You Think..”
I was so thrown by the title then I under stood
Here in Panama (the country) some restaurants do exactly that.  For example, the place is called Brooklyn Burgers, and the place that makes it is called Brutto. and many others, since like May 2020
I just hope this isn’t another way of the big companies absorbing all the small businesses.
FNAF: Special Delivery     gimme my nuggets freddy
Hey mat and your crew, you should go together and make the irl FNaF a reality!
3 hours ago your video was uploaded 11:11 & Mr. Beast new video is 14:14 .....I'm scared
I thought this video would get a lot of hate and I was ready to just read hate for the rest of the day but its kinda tame ngl
jokes on u i saw this on tiktok
I haven’t heard “Buco di Beppo” in 8 years
I feel like the cooks end up getting screwed, unless they get a substantial raise which I doubt happens.
But then how about the ingredients? Isn't there a difference from kitchen to kitchen if there is not specific ingredients?when and where  did they find those ingredients this early?
Wait  McDonald’s logo is red and yellow McDonald’s is Soviet HA there’s something for you to look af
3:02 McDonald’s is communist
Buca di Beppo? 🤮 Mr Beast has Crohns. That is caused by a bad diet. Yeah, I ‘m looking for Crohns.
8:57 where’s my rent
Elmo approves of this video.
And I'm sure the minimum wage workers are getting paid extra for doing twice the work! /s
Scott Cawthon: *Sees this*   Also Scott Cawthon: "Fire up the Merch Machine, Were making Happy Meals!"
I don't know about u but having an animatronic knock on my door and then give me my food would be the best and the worst thing to happen if i were to order food online.  Best cause that would be just cool  Worst because i'd be paranoid that as soon as i look into my wallet when i look back at the animatronic it would jumpscare me (tho if that happened on halloween that would be perfect)
I’d love for matpat to open a restaurant called theory tacos or something....
Oh my god, Scott Cawthon could legitimately make a Freddy Fazbear's Pizza using this, the future is now.
"What a waste of money" You thought you could sneak that in but on holy authority I declare your puns heresy

Can't wait for music theory discusses music and dark theory in the world of music
suprized mt.beast has not comented here...
This isn’t really a theory but good vid
That’s the. Mr. beast ghost kitchen that Brandon Taylor tracked down on his video from when he tried the burgers
P
DoorDash Driver here, you'd be surprised by how many "new restaurants" I pick up orders from that are actually someone's house or apartment. Takes "homestyle cooking" to the next level.
Now you could add Mr Beast burger into your intro.
It’s all Italian chains. Who woulda thought.
Sue! Sue! Sue!
this is too far
Matpat ask question People: Hmm i dont know Me: hmm when is the next vid
No wonder matpat appeared one time in YouTube rewind 2020
Business is facts
You Jelly bro
Nah, I don't get delivered, the cost of delivery is absolutely ridiculous.
Wish someone ghost kitchened some of the smaller businesses here last year.   Maybe they would of survived the shut down :-(
Mr beast fans be like I'll ignore this
POV ur looking for mr beasts comment
Came expecting a dark truth, and found something quite informative and uplifting. Thanks Food Theory!
I have no words...
Wait this was post hours ago?!🤨😬 I swear I remember this being post weeks ago!
He’s a total douche but I will say he knows how to make a good Business
wow
I live in seattle and know a restaurant Buca di Beppo and they actually do work w mr beasts restaurant up there
I did like this channel THIS channel I just am triggered that this is on beast
Bro that kid is a financial prodigy
"Look these things up" I cannot for I am Canadian
Stop making company’s sound bad it doesn’t do any good
bone apple teeth
Food theory has single handedly taught me more about food and business then I ever thought I would learn or need. As someone who wants to open up a food truck it has helped ALOT to learn all this. Thanks matpat!
3:09 "Hold on tight guys and ghouls"  Ken Kaneki.... umm me?
I wonder how Mr. krabs feels about Mr.beast giving away money and food?
Watch the pod cast with his manager
Summary (sort of)  Apparently, MrBeast operates his burger business venture by paying inactive restaurant chains that operate hidden kitchens in order to produce their goods. Then, pay delivery companies to help them distribute these goods to the costumers. Right?
So are we just pretending Just Eat is not a thing
I refuse to pay delivery fees. I just want the option to pick up the food myself but that doesnt exist
I was just curious if the was a Mr Beast Burger location in my county, and there unfortunately isn’t 😕
Show me the locations and I'll be on my way
Ok... Coke vs Pepsi like, come on we have charcoal vs propane
This reminds me of the handicar episode from south park
MEET IN GREENSBORO
DTF. Delivering. The *f o o d .*
I did the search. local place delivering from for me was a Bertuccis.   nice
Me an Indian, who's seen this concept in action wayyy before the rona  We have kitchens that have a storefront for mobile phone repair and also deliver food. No seating required
I really thought mat is gonna say that Mr. Beast Burger is in the planting business.
Mat Pat opens virtual restaurant. Only drink available is Diet Coke. Finally gets sponsorship! IT PRINTS MONEY!!!
I came here to learn about  food,  I ended up learning about capitalism.
Wait 250 W Bridge Street is 2 miles from my house
There is a resturant on doordash called it's just wings and they are legit great. Turns out their made in chilies and avalaibly of said resturant happens to only be areas that have a chilies
Is this the krusty krab
*gasp* They deliver to me through a Buca di Beppo address! :O
Noice
I’d love to get something from mr beast burger, but there’s none in my area! ☹️
You rewinded a video of a shop opening at 8:33 the person walked back wards at the end
Who came looking for Mr.Beasts comment? ⏬
its gunna take over the world  and all of us will only eat..    *mr beast burgers*
When you hear taiga, but its not talking about toradora: Sad weeb noises.
I was waiting for a food theory episode on this. Thank you Matt😁
Mr beast burger isn’t available in my area 😭
I have a question,  What does Mr. Beast do that makes him so much money?
Matpat made this video hinting to Scott to make fnaf pizzeria
I smell cap
I'm saying this before I watch the video: I'm assuming it's something of a joke restaurant that he hopes people pick up on being a joke
That intro. Nice
How come 3:31 made me think about vanossgaming?
Hm Chuck E Cheese making a Sister Restaurant? I mean with the FNAF Conspiracies following the company a sister restaurant sounds ALOT like FNAF Sister Location am I the only person that even put this to thought?
Would one celeb's product be more expensive than another because of the popularity and/or name attached to it or would they all be the same because they are all made with the same produce with nothing "special" to differentiate one from another.  Eventually once something has been "streamlined" so far, things become bland and the same.  It will become just another cookie cutter product that people will get bored with.
I feel like a ghost kichen restaurant for fnaf fits fnaf way more than a normal restaurant, am I right or am I wrong?😎
JUST WAISTED 11MINS OF MY LIFE
Matpat doesn't exist.
Mr Beast : opens a free restaurant that gives away money  Mr Krabs : Oh- *Dolphin and boat noises intensifies*
"Buca di Bepo" in italian means "Hole of Bepo". Add to this the fact that Beppi is a tipical italian old-style colloquial name AND VOILÀ!  The perfect recipe for a nice, garlic-smelling, satisfying old hole. Buon appetito.
I wouldn’t be surprised if MrBeast buys every single country on earth 🌎
Sooo a ghost kitchen is like a ghost writer, right?? o>o
Watch Jimmy make a ad for his restaurant
In new zealand most people still eat in, which means if the rest of the world follow suit, eat in restaurants will take over aga8n
Kind of similar to the Kirkland business model and the business model of most folks who sell against the brand these days. Find someone who has good product who could be making more but can’t sell more under their brand for whatever reason and offer to sell any excess production that they won’t be able to.
That moment when there’s only one Beast Burger in your state and it’s nearly an hour away.  B r u h
I had wondered how he pulled that off
bro these arnt even theories anymore
At first we didn't know what to do with all the money we tried burying it burning it but we eventually decided to just give it away
I think jimmy is going to loose a lot of money, no one is going to a restaurant with such a little menu
Depending on the amount gotten you may have to claim it as income or cost value prize to the IRS.
mr beast just launch a nation wide fast food chain and give it away to the workers, smh
Never heard of any of these chains, but hey I'm not American so that's probably why.
I thought you got on a video with him
This video just reminds me about Chuck E. Cheese and paqually’s pizza. Also, if Chuck E. Cheese goes under then Scott Cawthon and Matt should totally go in on a horror themed FNAF chain
I like  Mr beast burger logo
Who is SekoSeko, and why is he posting links in the comment section?
4:31 Sunglasses on sunglasses... because he's cooler than everyone else😎
Oh ho! Finnaly something interesting.
MAtPat uploaded Yassss
mr beast finaly made a living owu
I grew up watching spongebob now I don't think Mr krabs will wanna be friends with mrbeast
tea
Everyone: Knows this MrBeast character Me: Who the **** is he?
5:00 and shaq has his own pizza chain(or at least a pizza named after him).
WOOW, that's amazing
ngl the editing Is horrible.
You have a lot of Theron channels 😱
Matpats, where is your theory on FOOD from STORE
*exhale* B R U H
there seems to be a lot of sponsorship flavored honey on that burger matpat
how did he get all this money anyway?
Canada is always left out😞
Shut up...
a mr beast video came out today
Costumer: How much is this burger?  MrBeast: $-30
IS IT WEIRD I WANNA GET STUFFED INTO A FREDDY FAZBEAR SUIT
I could be entirely wrong but in case I'm not, depending on if this is considered a "gift" or "prize" I hope that the people who got money remember not to spend it all since the TAX man will want to collect their cut ... or at the very least don't bank it in so there's no paper trail of the money if you plan on cheating Mr Tax-man ;)  [ if this falls under "contest prizes, awards or raffles category" the federal government could treat "winnings" as ordinary income, tax-wise, and that applies regardless of how much you win. The IRS requests that you report even the smallest winnings ]
no ones gonna buy mr.beasts food in like 2 months once the hype dies down
Matpat: "FNAF Sister Brand wouldn't be bad" Scott: "Hippity, hoppity your idea is now my property"
You got all the main theories except BOOK theory! Get to it
They can also be called cloud kitchens
Ok restaurants enter something that factories for marts have been doing for years
Mat Pat: *brings up FNAF at the end of the video* Me:  Don't give Scott Cawthon ideas or you'll possibly get double the lore to piece together. Lmho jk
2021: Corporations now have side hustles. Who'd'a thunk lmao
Fun fact being even more last is more impressive than first
First theory I already new 🙌❤️
This was so interesting!! Great video !!
What an absolute genius
They should totally open a restaurant chain called Matt’s Patties
You wanna know one of the rarest restaurants? Search up kewpee on Google the city i live in has 3 of the 5 known left in the world
I really liked this theory. Was extremely informative and make me look at dining and finances in a whole new way
Coming soon: Theorist Thuringers
Mr. Beast:(sees pigs on his island) do I own these pigs?
Mr Beast Burger is people!!!!!
If this concept isn't terrifying to you, idk what to tell you. The WHOLE POINT of different brands is to offer different things. Even different brands in the same realm have different suppliers and specific recipes that help differentiate them from each other. When you're getting identical burgers with different boxes, what's the point of even ordering from a given brand besides being on their "team"?
This might be true, but what happens when the world goes back to normal? I anticipate when and if our oppressively overpowered governments let the world go back to normal there will be a huge decline in food delivery, because nobody will want to A: be paying the stupidly high fees anymore B: want better quality food you can only get with dine in and C: want the dine experience back and theyll ditch delivery for good.
This is genius
I swear, you find a way to fit fnaf into everything. But I love it🤣
MatPat's tone of voice makes this sound like an epic exposed video. But it's... just good things? This all an excellent thing I'm happy exists. He makes it sound like he's just exposed them for child slavery with his tone of voice, lol.
As a chef this sounds epic
The monster sucks
Me- *orders food from a Freddy Fazbear* Freddy- *breaks the door and stuffs me in an animatronic* Me- MAT PAT.....WHAT DID YOU DOOOO ? !!!!!
is it just me or is this possibly an answer to the problem of so many small time food businesses going out of business this year
I've never heard of Mr Beast or any of these restaurants. I never get delivery.
Mind blown 🤯
I wish I could try them. But there isn’t one at my location. I’d imagine MrBeast would put up a restaurant in the biggest city in the US. But I guess not
Door dash can’t call such a business a win
Cool video!
I look them up on there app to see what was around me and found out that the food comes from some of the worst burger places around
What if virtual restaurants all fail and nothing like that ever becomes viable in the long term?
I'm realizing that most of these top comments are from around the same time the video came out and had nothing to do with the video which just means they are highly liked because they've existed for longer so my comment I was going to make about Mr Divicovich is now obsolete...
Mr beast: *Dies* everyone's bank account: 50k.
4400 something comment let’s go
This is matpats “mrbeast wont comment” vid
I was scared mr beast was going to be called out for something thankfully not
Matt Pat says: FNAF Sister Brand  Me: FNAF SISTER LOCATION
Mr Beast is the rich guy we all need.
True "ghost kitchens" aren't actual restaurants at all; they exist solely as kitchens for virtual restaurant and food brands. MrBeastBurger uses more of a franchise model, working with existing restaurants (but specifically not ghost kitchens) who prepare his products alongside their own. It isn't a HUGE distinction, but it's important to understand that MrBeastBurger is explicitly working with actual restaurants, providing additional streams of revenue for an industry suffering under the impacts of COVID. He is specifically not contracted with any virtual-only kitchens.
I think we ALL know what will MatPat do with a "ghost kitchen"... test new theories! XD
Hey guys ima go to free money what you want?
Hey MatPat, how's the FOOD doing?
On a side note, Pizza Hut has been doing this already with it's "ghost kitchen" called Wingstreet.
WHATS THE COLOR BLUE
Tell the truth, you made this video just so you could say "Buca di bepo"
A benefit of virtual restaurants not mentioned here bc it's not really relevant to the episode theme is that less space is taken up by eateries. If multiple restaurants can exist in one location its not just an efficient use of kitchen resources but efficient use of space in a world that never seems to have enough
I was with my mom I had the red yellow orange 🍊 up in shields for a pink brown
3:32
50 years later MrBeast Burger est 2020
Matt Man
Mans Said bucca di beppo faster then eminem
I see a world of boring repetitive foods that will all start to taste exactly the same. Just with toppings rearranged and a different name slapped on it.
Fun fact the funding mr beast could have went to ppe for medical workers
For those who didn’t get a mr.beast burger don’t worry, we’ll be planting 1000 trees in liberty Missouri in your name.
can you please do a theory and figure out who the scranton strangler is in the office
This is actually...very interesting! Probably one of my favorite food theories lol
You should do a theory on Godzilla on how is he able to walk on land without the ground crumbling beneath him.
Im waiting for MrBeast to comment on this video
This is Mr. Beast's next step to world domination.
But isn't the food from mrbeast burger bad?? I've heard a lot of people say that the food was terrible.
Quick suggestion. Just don’t put the little pix of fnaf characters on vids bc it scares a lot of kids and you could be getting way more views. I know a family I tried showing one of your vids but the second a FNAF character was on screen, they wouldn’t watch any more of your vids.
Aup
Neither is markiplier
Last
Hold up, this was in MY FUCKING TOWN and I NEVER HEARD ABOUT IT?????
start the 30 day countdown!
Last 🥱
This is genius.
Last 🥱
Matpat is going to far
MatPat working the drive thru: “Hello welcome to FastFood Theory, would you like the Game or Film meal? We have FNAFy Meal with Freddy Fazfries, Chicanuggets, and Bonnie Burger or our MegaMorty meal with Rick Roasted chicken with a side of flumbus.”
It’s sad that you have to make a full video about this because Mr Beast manipulates his young audience to believe he’s doing more than he’s actually doing.
hang on... when he said 'fast food restaurant there was a finger pointing at mcdonalds...but you made a video on how mcdonalds isnt a restaurant at all, so which is it!
I haven't heard of any of these restaurants... I feel like I'm missing out
Is it kinda like jack in the box because I saw one in at a gas station
Sadly I'd only believe this if I got a stack of cash from Mr. Beast via parcel. Ez bet.
Yes.
🅝🅘🅒🅔
Omg idc I got it it was  sooo good and you don’t pay for it stupid
I feel like MatPat had alot of fun saying Buca Di Beppo so many times
Ur playing with fire with that thumbnail😂
Wait bucca do bepo is a real place?
Who agrees that MrBeast has to do a Fnaf restaurant
0:13 ugh what a waste of money was that a joke or for real?
Open a food theory restaurant
Matthew Patthew makes great videos
But if you order it’s not free?
"MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think"  Is not made of MrBeast?
So... pretty much the same pattern as cloud computing? AWS has servers and engineers, VDC has kitchens and chefs... and both provide a service on demand for small orders, statistically balancing the load to remain within capacity and profitable...
It was just for a video
Ok...
Looking forward to the new theorist restaurant: Brain food
wow last time i saw this guy he was at 20k subs it was 6 months ago and he has grown so much
Mmmm FOOD
Let’s see how many subscribers I can get from this comment ;-;  Dream: 10k                                Current: 0
What if Scott Cothen open his own Fnaf restaurant that has has all types of pizzas
These are all money losing businesses.
Not Mc Donald’s is better here in the uk
matpat ain't getting in the next creator games
Starting by FLEXing on mr. Beast You give away your money, i clean with it
Up next.. Game theory restaurant!
Order a pizza, Chicka deliver.
Cmon tech theory
Some Mr Beast will take over McDonalds.
I giggle every time he says Buca di Beppo. Such a funny sounding name.
Sushi theory?
So the restaurant meta changed...
Then what is it
please make a myth theory channel! or book theory!
Tutti italiani sti ristoranti
I already knew this :/
Me at the beginning of video: Haha, Buca de Bepo. Funny words go brrrr.  Me after the video: It's...real?
1:26 Patrick star: I was 4 parallel universes ahead of mr beast.
That website is going to get a LOT of foot traffic after this: virtual foot traffic xD They better give you a cut becauxr of this matpat xD
Can you do a food theory on two of my favorite foods popcorn (ex: which microwave popcorn brand gives most popped corn per bag) and bacon. Love your theorys, and keep it up
300 locations... 10× the amount of videos on food theory. Im not lying. I counted. 30 videos. 5 months. Wow.
Mat pat has big sacs for the macs
This ghost kitchen concept I feel as an equal chance to go big as it is to go broke in the long term. If you think about it, the pandemic DID enable the rise of food delivery and delivery apps. The problem lies is what happens AFTER the pandemic. Ideally when we get to a point ~70% of the total population is vaccinated and herd immunity kicks in to halt covid-19 (and yes even if there are mutations it could be a yearly vaccine like the flu) then what? People aren't just going to go out of eat anymore? Here in the States eating is as much a social activity than anything else, and many people are lazy and don't want to cook (in my part of the country landscapers and caterers are big business because people have money but don't want to actually cook/do yard-work) and eventually there will come a point where restaurants will open again. What then? The niche ghost kitchens filled will vanish, and those kitchens may start to drop the celebrity brands, or at the very least push them into a smaller corner. Sure people will still want to order delivery, but when post-pandemic hits the demand for it probably won't be nearly that high.  Also you forgot the app delivery drivers. We all know by now those companies classify their drivers as "contractors" on paper. That gives the the ability to deny them benefits and dodge liability in case of injuries on the job, in addition to preventing unionizing. Everyone took it from the original "business contractors playbook" Vince McMahon (it could have been senior though I'm not entirely sure). WWE wrestlers have been the original "contractors", McMahon using that loophole to ensure his company isn't liable for wrestlers injuries, healthcare costs, and to ensure they continue to work (often times to breaking) without proper compensation. If this ghost kitchen does take off and be the "new face of dining" then what happens to the drivers?  Prop 22 in California was a harsh blow to this issue, big companies pouring millions into marketing to convince the public it was "good for business". What it did was ensure delivery drivers for grubhub, door dash, and the like can be classified as "independent contractors". Which allows the companies to avoid providing government-mandates services like minimum wages, health benefits, and even bargaining powers which employees have.  The entire issue is much larger than a simple comment here, but the fact remains. Whether ghost kitchens as a concepts goes boom or goes bust in the next several years, there will be more issues at play than simply changing the restaurant/dining industry game.
Dropshipping but with food.
POV: you wanted to see if MrBeast commented on this
Free food. NDL did it first with "not mcdonalds"
I noticed that the MrBeast Burger is right next to the Buca di Beppo in Austin already. I didn't realize they were they were cooking.
I think this is going to hit trending
oof not wearing masks while preparing it or is that from before? Are they in a bubble?  At least its delivery now ofcourse
Should we arrest him? Oh right wrong galaxy.
i thought buca di beppo was a fake company that you made up
when I heard ghost kitchen, I thought of a kitchen as a ghost
Hey are there any vegetarian version of these burgers?
me: see's title and thinks "oh this is going to be cool" me:  *watches five minutes* me: WHAAAATTTT?????
the closest beast burger to me is 4 hours and 30 mins away
I love that i live in poland, especially in the middle of a forest where no resteurants are.
I just love the way he pronounces Buca Di Beppo lol
I like that name boca da pepo
So what your saying is that mr beast burger still helps people even without jimmy giving away money    Someone hes nowhere but everywhere
Me who got a burger: wut
isnt that like a monopoly colecting money from 100s of other stores???
Here I thought it's a theory about MrBeast secretly being a vampire. It's just an explanation about something I thought everyone knows about.
Am I the only who has never heard of a Buca Di Beppo?
I bet the seko bots gonna respond to this comment
It’s obviously a burger made out of Mr Beast clones turned into meat.
only tyga bites are available near me
yeah, 2020 have changed all of our concept on F.O.O.D. isn't mat pat, hows your F.O.O.D. tasting? Wounder what new video will be posted on here, FOOD theory and Film theory, right DAD?
Thumbnail: "It's NOT real!" Oh ok so MrBeast Burger pulled a Markiplier
Sure the logic might work but are the sales? I feel like the fad will die down once everyone has tried a beast burger and then realises that they aren't as good as well known established chains or local places
Mind blown
you tryna start beef?
Yet since i live in the middle of nowhere delivery isnt an option. Not with doordash or a pizz chains. Just no- i never ordered food ever
Hey
Never heard of it
I literally don’t care and your videos are bad.
Explains why some locations only have 3 items.
you know what else is not real? Markiplier
Man im tired of you giving everything single lore like if i showed you my pants you be like what the lore behind the pants
Matpat: fnaf sister brand sounds good  Me: isn’t that just sister location
OOH FOOD THEORY POSTED BETTER COMMENT SOMETHING
I learn so much from this channel
Mr. Beast Surelly View This Video In A False Account With NordVPN
me when I heard chucky cheese is going bankrupt: lets open up a freddy frazbears pizza  me 2021: well if I do open this restaurant lets hope the purple guy doesn't screw it up like in the games
I was pretty disappointed in going to a physical location and they straight up did not know MrBeast and had received other questions about him. Yeah, its a virtual brand. And Yeah, I wanted to go in person, believing I'd get some cash or something with the burger. But naw, its just a virtual brand.
I don't entirely agree that these will ALL last. While plenty of people are happier with the ever-widening options for food, if/once full chains can re-open in full, I feel a number of these companies will fail if their overall quality isn't up to snuff.
The only place he hasn’t launched his place is in New Mexico It’s next to Texas if you didn’t know
2:41 execute order 66
matpat: "fnaf sister brand sounds pretty good" fnaf sister location: "am I a joke to you?"
You could do a theory on which delivery app is the best
Ordered it the first day and my card number was stolen from the same company that ran the card in Florida.
Game theory ruins a hobby, Film Theory ruins a childhood and Food Theory ruins... uh... I dunno.
You need to do a theory on how mrbeast is going to buy the world
With all the crazy things that have happened on YouTube, matpats next channel will just be conspiracy theory
At least you can get a MrBeast Burger
I drove all the way to Palo Alto and it wasn’t even real😂
Mr beast is probably gonna react to this
Everybody:no you cant just give the food for free Mr.beast : haha money go brrrrrrrrrrrrr
It doesn't actually change anything. Ya still get food.
Mr beast really neads this cause his videos are so expensive
There is a Bucca de bepo 10 miles from my house
awwwwww! why there aren't any MrBeast Burgers here in Italy?!
Waiting for mrbeast to comment on the video
matpat i dare you to make a vitual restraunt called fazbear pizza
But what will happen when restaurants fully  open at the end of 2021 or next year?
Wait Did FNAF sister location predict this 9:40
Me eating mcdonald's while watching this
This whole video could've been shrunk to 5min
Make a video about Not McDonalds
First we have the Travis Scott burger and now mr beast has one
Great now review the burgers TODAY AT FOOD THEORY
NOOICE
Mr. Beast is just taking advantage of Bravo's owner's idea.  This wasn't his idea anymore than it was Mariah's, Tyga's, or anyone else using that service.  Sorry Mr. Beast fans.
Matpat just reveal Sports Theory already
2 vids in 2 hours! Incredible
There's a lot of Mr Beat references in this FNAF video
Mr beast burger is free
I was watching this and then guess what ad showed up in the middle of it menulog. (It’s like door dash where i live)
In the part where it shows the woman flip an open sign to a close sign I think it's reverser because at the end she walks back but she's still looking at the sign just as if she was walking forward also she doesn't turn or anything. I mean I know nobody really cares but I think it's cool that they just reversed that video
I swear their was one cheapskate restaurant owner that thought they'd save money by re-using pizza, because when cheapskates open food serving places where you need to buy new product constantly...it sounds like a good idea...cheapskates would do this, until the law stops them.  I actually worked at a taco bell that was going under and they did cut corners, they did.
Stop milking this please!
I'd love a fnaf irl. I'd so eat there all the time especially if they had the animatronics
When Mcdonalds Thought They Had Some Competition with the kfc console
Wher is this fast food
I tried it. it was terrible. sad soggy burger, half fries gone. Today I checked and it's "temporarily closed" in SLC UT!
Mr Beast is not a nice guy. I manage a gym in NC and he and his friends came in, made fun of the members who were over weight, when I kicked them out they went next door to the big lots and knocked over shelving, damaging the products and store altogether. He may give money and prizes away, but he is a body shaming asshole.
Thank you
First america, then Canada, then the UK, then Australia, then New Zealand. I live in the UK also if Mr beast makes it to the UK before little cesars pizza I will flip.
All I'm saying is Mattpat is frightening intelligent and if he were to actually pursue a goal I don't think he'd be one with whom to F
Oof size mega for Alaska
Cats: meow Dogs: woof 9-year-olds: *FIRST FIRST*
You are not first, You are not last, But most certainly Nobody asked
Wait, the first MrBeast burger was in Texas, not Eastern NC? I didn’t realize that... that surprises me!
Popular thing:exists  Mat pat:where is hidden lore
Why do joggers love grape koolaid?
Chuck e cheese made a *sister location* XD
Talk about a "special delivery" 😂
This seems like a good way to support local restaurant businesses
"It is real for me" I don't know where this quote was from but I heard it before
hope small, private businesses can take advantages of this. they are the ones who got fucked the most by lockdowns
So it’s like restaurant roommates
#theoryburger
That doesn’t make mr beast bad? He just smart
how he has that much money?
11 Minutes just to explain ghost kitchens?
A 50mil subs channel, a gaming channel with 10+mil subsidi, 300 restaurant, what next?
"FNAF Sister Brand doesn't sound too bad"  Or... you know.....  *Sister Location*
Rule Britannia Britannia Rule the waves.
Can i please go there
Notice me senmpi
This is part of why I subscribe, I would have never known about this if it wasn't for you.
He was in a Mrbeast video
“Mrbeast” Opens burger restaurant. “ Food theory” Allow us to introduceret ourselves.
If he still had 1-5 mil there would be like five people coming
Today is my brthday🎂
Virtual restaurants have been around since before 2020, but definitely not on this scale! In LA, we could actually get Los Pollos Hermanos, lol.
Next MrBeast video be like.             I just bought the World! And me and the boys are gonna put trees around the World!
When you dont live in the US and thought that Buca di Beppo was a made up name
Imagine if matpat has to explain the fnaf lore every single time he orders a pizza from Freddy fazbears pizza
Imagine Mr.Beasts just comments this awesome video “that’s just my theory A FOOD THEORY!”
As much as Mat Pat has complained about the fnaf series he sertantly seems keen on it now...
so your telling us that Mr beast is also saving some restraunts from closing? he really is a great dude
Wow, spent 11 minutes explaining what a ghost kitchen was. How is this a theory?
4:31 Double sunglasses yo. 😎🕶
“But that’s just some facts. Some FOOD facts!”
so its cable TV for food? can see a future years from now when they have 100's of virtual brands signed on,  where the virtual service goes "double my cut or im locking you out of my ktichens" 30 dollar cheeseburgers anyone? and what are you, as the consumer, gonna do? not buy the delivery food? all the brands you love are there! sure you can cook at home but, we know ya won't.
What is... this?
Dude u just roasted mrbeast DO U KNOW WHAT U HAVE DONE
Fnaf ar and a delivery app team up to deliver haunted pizzeria themed foods. That'd be funny
One down fall for delivery apps for me they all don't deliver to me since i live in a small town which sucks
But hey that’s just a theory A RICH THEORY and cut
Do a Theory on ordinary Sausage
😀😡💥💥💥💥☠😡
This wasn't new information, or a theory
;v;
my theory is this channel was made just for this video
well I have 1K Subs
A lot of housing corporations have DBAs that operate similarly
Great video mat! I love that your editing skills have been improving for years! It looks great!
Hey, Mat. How was your FOOD? I’m sure it was delicious, FOOD always is...
We talked about this over at Swell Entertainment's comment section, but it's worth putting here too:  The model isn't new. It's been around for almost as long as kitchens have been around. The main issues that plague Ghost Kitchen concepts are based around efficiency. Fast Food restaurants, like McDonalds, optimize their production line to handle the products they sell. It only takes a few minutes to make their food because their machines and kitchen design are specifically designed to handle the volume and type of food they make. Their kitchen matches their menu.  In a Ghost Kitchen environment, the kitchen has to be designed to allow for almost any type of food. The kitchen staff have to all be trained in an extremely wide array of menu items, and the expo people have to be really on point with setting up orders to be taken. In the past, the Ghost Kitchen suffered because of the amount of time it takes for a normal kitchen to produce the same food as a specialized fast food kitchen.  On top of this, fast food restaurants are highly standardized so that the quality of the food is the same across the board. There should be next to zero differences between locations. With Ghost Kitchens, because of staffing rotations, one cook might salt heavier than another cook. A cook might personally prefer their hamburger meat to not be fully cooked and thus send out undercooked hamburgers. Another, like myself, might know that the requirement for ground meat in food service is that it be fully cooked (Well done in common speech) which will then have people receive a different quality of burger from the same location.  All said, the Ghost Kitchen model works for fast casual chains like Buca et al. because they're pseudo-fast food anyways. There will always be a market for it, but there will also always be issues with it in the long run. I support them, as a chef still in the industry, but I caution consumers to be aware that wait times can drastically vary between locations and brands.
When I was watching this video, I chuckled to myself every time I heard the name "Buca di Beppo"
Wait, those MrBeast orders I keep declining on doordash are actually associatated with MrBeast?  I though the name was just a coincidence.
GAME THEORY buy a licence from Scott cawthon when The pandemic is over and make a walk through horror attraction like FNAF 3 where you have actual animatronics that scare you and you get food at the end... I would genuinely buy food there
Can't trust you any more cause dad took over srry but u ain't matpat
So the Guga foods dream is alive?
Don’t even buy Mr Beast burgers, it’s literally so expensive for a burger worth 3$
This is why I think if a restaurant had to close because of the pandemic it was simply a correction of the market. Many places are busier than they have ever been, and make more money with less staff. I'm interested to see where ghost kitchens go in the future.
Clout commercial
Ok but imagine if there was a fnaf escape room but it’s also a restaurant
No
Me when MrBeast Burger opened: "Nice, I'll order something"    MrBeast: "You are outside the delivery zone"
None in Joplin/ Webb city Missouri😭😭😭😭😭
Bravos is also a trampoline park
We only have Tyga Bites here :(, and with pretty bad reviews.
While I do applause the eternal capacity of humans to adapt from any situation to get what they want (Aka MONEY), I do am scared on the long term for exploitation of workers.  You see, Kitchen while being sometimes overthrown can handle themselves by the fact that only a certain number of people can be in the restaurant at the same time, in the case of Ghost kitchen, there's no limit. They'll be quickly having from 30 to 100 orders to fill at a certain time from one day to another, and it will become a complete mess.  I do hope that people adapt themselves so that this "safe" model is viable, but I don't think so.
Saying Bucca di Beppo over and over sounds like you're beatboxing.
Turtle approves of this video
This was legit under a mr beast video
These ghost kitchens partnering up is such a smart business move.
Coolbeans
In your intro you forgot to add freddy  fazbears! That's right I know your phone guy XD
“First free restaurant” Soup kitchens: You sure about that?
Could you please do a theory on whether or not Mondo could have been turned into butter from, Danganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc? I would love to watch it, and I think it could be a cool video idea!  Sorry if this spoiled the game for you.
Everyone: Mr. Beast burger is awesome  Me not being able to eat it because I’m vegan:   -__-
Its just a digital restaurant, mr beast allows local restaurants who are suffering during covid to use his name as a digital store to bring them more business.   Now it all depends on the location and the places that take these up. Because if you think about it, all locations and areas serve different styles of buns and stuff.
woohoo mrbeast
Fnaf pizza place? fnaf pizza place..? Fnaf Pizza Place.
Can I buy beast burgers with honey?
Have you been eating your FOOD, DAD is just looking out for your health
First Game Theory, then Film theory, now Food Theory.  Man, I can’t wait for the CONSPIRACY Theory YouTube Channel Matt’s going to create next!
I know he wants more ad money so he makes his videos 10 minutes+(I'm pretty sure) but I'd like his videos so much more if they weren't stretched 😩
So basically the same shameless concept as they did with clothing brands like gucci vs your Wal-Mart brand, one isn't any better then the other but idiots pay more for that "name brand"
Yay the rich get richer
BICADIBEPO
You should still buy local.  This doesn't help small businesses as much as you'd think.
Do you know thet there is a real frediz pizzaria
This is youtube corruption at its prime, mr beast is a huge problem disguised as a saint. He gave all this excess away instead of doing say a food drive through this virtual restaurant. he isnt helping hes just trying to be a legend, and a shitty one at that
I’m watching this sun Mr. beast just posted a video🤣🤣
I swear Never make that joke again
This actually is creating a problem! I doordash and Mr beast burger was backed up and literally hours behind for the two times I went there. I met other drivers and apparently it's been like this for awhile.
Wait this wasn't obvious enough for people
Matpat: posts this Mrbeast: posts another video flexing his wealth 1 hour later
Mr Beast is quivering
This is matt very obviously ignoring things that normally he would focus on. the implications and dangers of it now being expected for workers to have to do this, the food lying around more than ever, the business may be safer, but the food isnt. I dont know if because youre a youtuber, or you have a hand in this, so you want people to normalize it so you can do it too. but this is setting a precident that will HURT the industry after all is said and done. waiters are already some of the work paid employees, cooks and chefs too. this is hurting people that are already over worked.
3:01 * Russian anthem begins to play *
Bucca Di Peppo is a mouth full
Yeah, but how clean are they, really? One of my local diners had an employee test positive for the virus. How many people have since been infected? My family and I stopped getting food from joints a while ago, in case something exactly like that happens. And, to make matters worse, the diner is going to open again soon. More chance for more contagion.
New Mr beast video came up as I was watching
fnaf
I see this vid and I get a notification that mrbeast bought everything in 5 stores
The burger literally takes like a million dollars
Hello
Mrbeast posted a video as I'm watching this
This is actually a great way for those ghost kitchens to stay in business. That’s kind of badass.
A
If it helps small businesses I'm in support
He only helped exist restaurants that all he didn’t open a restaurant
GOD DANG IT MATPAT
Haters
I can't wait for the bob's burger's episode where he needs money so his kids set this up. The plot twist is that he is making the new and more popular "pesto burger and even though he is making more money then he ever has before bob ruins the good thing he had going on because he is petty.   If this ends up happening someone please tell me, I must know if I got the Shinning.
no.
This is one of those things that I really want to try but yet it’s not in my state and I’m not a big enough fan to go to another state for it. So hopefully a few of them pop up here in WV.
The real question is whether matdonalds is better than mr beast burger
Now we wait matpats new fast food restaurant burger theory
Who else got MrBeast burger notification at the same time of the video
Here before mr beast has commented himself
Woah I never thought that someone could make a restaurant that doesn’t make the goods
Buca di Beppo has the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had
You've been doing do much you tuber theorys you should just make a new channel
Mr beast is just using the money cheat to help everyone out
Dam this make me hongry
Hey Mr beast if you are here I dare you nay i double dare you to deliver a burguer to my location
Mr beast in 20 years be like... lAsT To LeAvE MaRs KeEpS iT!
Just waiting for MrBeast to reply...
Unfortunately you can not guarantee that all the ghost kitchens will follow all the same procedures or quality to your brand as you would expect. But I hope this is something others can learn from so that this doesn't happen or lessen any brands quality of food they want to provide.   Example: https://goo.gl/maps/NTsdo4JqJQ6eXQ777  my own experience during the crisis with a certain ghost kitchen location
So interestingly I looked up on Doordash to a see if any where in our area, and none mentioned in this video are; but then looking over the new additions I find 'Sauced' a new wing place. Curiously I look it's menu over, and immediately think 'This feels very similar to Krystal's menu' So I look up the address, and bam. Its a Ghost Kitchen working outta the local Krystal.
:( I can't get a Mr. Beast Burger since I don't think ANY delivery app will deliver across a state.
And that is a food theroy
Mr Beast’s manager (i think) actually said there wasn’t any ghost kitchens in their thing.
Wow a man honestly helped make more jobs just by doing this
I only learned of that Italian restaurant through him 💀
so did you buy fnaf... I meannnnn Chuck-E-Cheese with scott yet?
How do ppl not know what ghost kitchens are. They are everywhere and have been for a long long time. Definitely thought this was common knowledge
"2 million likes and we open Food Theory, where your food is served with a theory about the in-depth lore of Fnaf"
2:55
I see it coming: You can create a Food brand as easy as a merch
This sounds great until you are a cook at one of these restaurants and have to memorize not only that restaurant's menu (which is always subject to change), but all these other virtual restaurants as well. I was a waiter at a chain restaurant here in the states when grub hub and door dash started to really take off It was really difficult on the weekends with a packed house and standard to-go orders, but once you added the online orders in it was like absolute chaos. And every time the delivery driver was late, we got bad reviews on Yelp. TLDR: Be nice to the people who work in customer service; they work hard.
5:00 time stamp
Mrbeast u goona comment on this?
Why not look in to Kate yup there is some scary stuff in it
Honestly if want a five nights at freddy's resteaunt irl to visit just for the exp
Thats cool and all but how can you even run 3 channels and merch and gt live and parent a kid  all at the same time congrats man on all the way youve come
That moment when they show the in and out you go to 😱
I could not help but think that mr beast looks like Noble's cooler older brother.
Everything as a Service
words can't describe how much i love this channel
My gf's whole family got some MrBeast burgers and they messed up my "Plain meat and cheese" burger, were really expensive, and tasted bad.
Bro there’s a mr beast burger in Nebraska but none in Louisiana, this is rasism
300 locations and zero in my entire state.
**this will help the economy*
Oh Matthew Patthew, you should've been more careful! It's ok. EVERYTHING IS OK!!
My Father owns a restaurant and MrBeast asked if they could use it for a haunted restaurant video. I know the next video soon. (He declined the offer)
Theres a loooooot of ghost kitchens in my area. I didnt notice It until i started ordering delivery late last year (before Mr beast made it really blow up) like there's a bbq restaurant who is now serving buffalo wings with 50 sauces in one ghost restaurant and scratch burgers in the other.
Mister beast is so cool he wears double shades
Wait it was in south lake ??? I LIVE THERE 😭😅😢
Would love it if this takes off.
0:00 Are you stupid? They gave you lettuce for napkins, that’s why it’s not getting sucked up
I bet Scott (FNAF)  has the cogs turning in his head with this.  Can't wait to see what he might do with it
I don’t think the food is the selling point
I was driving back from a practice (Sports), and on Postmates, are Grubhub. My dad said, “Hey! There’s this new thing called Mrbeast burger”. So that was a coincidedinky
niko omilana: opens a free restaurant MrBeast : amma end this mans career
See, why in n out only has 342 locations, they aren’t trying to expand, they are going for nostalgia and that means not a whole lot of new locations
Can someone give me a TL;DR of this? I'm at a bar rn and I want the scoop
7:16 Is it sad I recognized the 'New' symbols and felt old? If so or not, who else feels old?
i want youtube theory
I like how he used the owner of the motel from the Tobey Magurie Spiderman series to talk about rent.
Odd how when I heard the phrase "Ghost Kitchen" I immediately thought of an SCP.  The one where you order food off a flyer and it magically gets delivered to you.
Mr. Beast Burger: The gift that just keeps on giving.
Jimmy Donald son? WOW!
So yeah ghost kitchens are great, but doesn’t that mean that a burger from New York  spot would be completely different than like, a California one or anything like that?
Matpat i have a question can you do a theory on #markiplierisintreal cus when i heard about is was like wth!!!!! I was so confused and with lixians confesion and the other one i am just losing my mind!!! So yea just wanted to ask.
cheese
MrBeast: I am youtuber to have the first free restaurant Niko Omilana and British fans:hold my restaurant
Mr.Beast is a successful YouTuber and restaurant owner. Next year he’ll make his own Triple A Game.
I've never heard of ghost kitchens. That's an amazing business model
I actually figured this out when I looked into it after hearing about the restaurant chain. Unfortunately there are currently no locations that deliver to my location.
MatPat I get ordering from fnaf and out of nowhere a 1-3ft or 5-10ft animatronic comes to your door with your food would scare you
Are you sure this wasn't sponsored by Buca Di Beppo? lol
Imagine if this comment got 33k likes
Chili’s has one and the ghost restaurant is called just wings
I went to Salt Lake City to let my kids try a Mr Beast Burger.  The experience sucked pretty hard.  The Italian restaurant  (same one mentioned here) that made my food forgot items,  but I could do nothing about it for a week because the Mr Beast customer service line is controlled by some virtual restaurant management company that was closed for the weekend and didn't return calls.   The model is to convoluted to offer a good experience
FALSE
Matpat hates MrBeast burger because they sell diet PEPSI LIKE WHAT MAT NEED HIS DIET COKE
I need to stop watching these videos at 11:00pm cause now I'm hungry
mat, check out papa razz
Omg that's what happened!! That is how it is here in Long Beach! There is one address where you can order on postmates for Ramen,  hispanic food,  and a lot more!
Are there MrBeast Burgers worldwide? I want to try some!
I ATE OEN A week ago it’s good
Well, I live in the middle of nowhere kinda, so we don't get MrBeast Burger. Casual dining has managed to come back mostly here though because people don't care about the virus here. I have personally never used one of these delivery services actually. I usually just get carryout, curbside (assuming the restaurant employees feel like coming outside), or delivery from the restaurant.
The napkin is a money
Question: Does anyone else wonder how YouTubers like Mr. Beast get their start? I get confused at YouTubers whose content is this extreme (giving extravagant gifts/money away).
Great video!
Hello
So mrbeast is basicly doing something for the restaurants
I just want to say hi to my favorite YouTuber be for I end my meaningless life  So hi
Cool
iS mR. bEaSt BuRgEr A sAnDwIcH?!?!
Give this comment a like if you like mr beast
#MrBeastBurger
Business class: you can’t make a restaurant and just give away money MrBeast: hold my millions of dollars, also you can keep it.
What if MrBeast watch this.
Buca Di Bepo is just so fun to say
I want matpat to open a restaurant chain
What about markiplier
Why do you think restaurant make more than 5 meals? maybe because people want more diversity... so why would they be ok with virtual restaurants having just few meals? also you say they are adventegous, because physical contact may be forbidden, but what about prevention on distant contact? Like solar eclipse-> satelites dead -> internet dead... or hacker attack, military conflict, or even just health issues connected with not even moving from house to get food.... there is a lot cons in that that I feel you simply ignore
matpat my friend....fnaf already has a sister brand...its called sister location
POV: you rushed to the comments to see if mrbeast commented
You should start MatDonald's instead
Now my FNAF ghost chain can be a reality
krabby pattys aoutta paper ;D
BUCA DI BEPPO
Mr beasts new restaurant? Wait as a Brit have I missed something
i really hope the businesses that closed because of the pandemic get a second chance through ghost kitchens
WAIT I thought it was just a random name MatPat came up with but Buca di Beppo is real?!
Can you make a theory about cans of FOOD?
A restront with 300 locatins great cronol sandress more like mrbeast burgur curse
How did I not know about this until noe
Now I wished that Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was actually a thing.
AMAZING
Honestly thought he was saying "Bucket of Beppo" instead of "Bucka di Beppo"
I hope mr.beast restaurant chane reaches Europe
@matpat how was the can of F.O.O.D you got from dad why don't you do a theory on that!
So my questions are, A: outside of the name brand, what makes beast burgers worth eating? and more importantly...B: if you were to order a beast burger from what's actually a buca de bepo, and one from what's actually a bravo, are they going to be made and taste the same?
9:54 we know what you’re doing matthew
Fan fact: yummy
MatDonald might be a good name for a not restaurant
Who else has never even heard of "celebrity" Mr. Beast before?
10:02 What a minute. That place seems familiar; like I have seen many many times. Hmm
At the start of the episode you said what a waste of money but he gives the money away and it’s free
What if Scott does the same same thing as Mr.Beast and give little fnaf figurines/toys with the food:^
Oooooooo boy
Wow 11:11
So, MatPat's not a robotic alien replacement clone?
Hi
I cant order anyways, the only downside of living in Europe.
Mr Beast is just built different
After hearing you say Buca di Beppo so many times, I wonder if you can say it ten times in a row with no stops.
Out of curiosity, where does the guys money come from? Massive inherence, investment, multiple businesses?
anyone else getting _Soylent Green_ Vibes by this? If you don't know _where_ your food is prepared, who can say what is in it?
Is anyone going to call up the fact that DAD makes a video about Matpat calling him out and later Mat pat posted this video like an hour apart or so. And what happed to Mat pat and that FOOD stuff?
AMAZING
Matpat: what a waste of money Me: you didn’t even buy the burger-
LAST
mat pat: what a waste of money MR beast:*sad mr beast noises*
First Markiplier isnt real and now this!?!!??
You know that Mr. Beast already said this so this video is pointless.
Nobody: Mr Beast Burger: S T O N K S
MatPat saying Buca di Beppo is really satisfying to me
Food theory
Can he add one in Maine Already
I wanna try mr beast burger
We want a food theory virtual restaurant
Mr Beast literally blows my mind. I’m half convinced he’s a god. *like literally everything he does just amazes me*
Why are there no captions :'(
Can’t I just eat my totally not real burger on peace mat pat
Ghost Kitchen sounds a little like VM’s for computers. It’s the same idea at least.
i am so sad i dont eat meat cuz i want a mr beast burger lol
E
I don’t trust blue free money man
Mr Krabs is typing...
I'm surprised he didn't mention that for those ghost kitchens being delivery only allows them to cut down on waste simply bv if its delivered and u don't like it or its not up to standards u end up throwing it away or giving it away urself
Mr krabs is the opposite of mr beast
God, this was a weird one for me. I've been to that PA Bravo for dinner in the before-times lol
aerogniawpiarg Scott Cawthon needs to open one of these (FNAF brand of course), and in some pizza boxes, there's a bit of lure
exist without exist
To be honest, they make the italian food about as well as they make the smashed burgers and chicken nuggies, so if anything being a ghost restaurant just means the cooks are now working under a reasonable expectation of their abilities.
I honestly don’t know what the icon of  the theory’s will be next  but I’m kinda excited for it
Scott Cawthon, you heard the man. Get moving and make that ghost kitchen.
Mr Beast and influencers: -opens ghost kitchen restaurants- Chilean fisco: How tax?
to where can these burgets deliver since im in croatia and i dont know whether i can get a mr beast burger from there
Day 1 of asking matpat to do a theory on FOOD
This is awsome
Imagine a virtual fnaf restaurant but instead of the restaurant being haunted, they send the animatronics to haunt your house for you!
I saves a lot more money than you think only having take-out.
Me, living in Greece, when matpat starts saying all this online food delivery apps:🤔
- "what's your secret recipe?" - "money." - "ummm, I meant: your cooking recipe." - "money." - "you sure buy awesome food ingreditents with that, right?" - "no." - "what then? more money?" - "no. customers."
This is so fascinating. I have a Buca in my city, and they do the MrBeast Burger! I definitely need to try lol
Anybody else convinced MatPat only made this video so he can just say "Buca di Beppo" over and over?
i would want a food theory restaurant.
Hey MatPad How is "DAD"
McDonalds after seeing this: Write that down, WRITE THAT DOWN!!!
Imagine they actually opened new restaurants
Ghost kitchens will certainly be one of the major factors to increase the profitability of food delivery apps. Someone can set up a commissary kitchen that doesn't have any dine-in options and only cater to food delivery or food truck prep. And several restaurants, even competitors, can get their food made in a commissary kitchen and those companies don't have to pay people to cook because the commissary kitchen and hire their own employees and train them cross-platform to cook whatever is on the menu. And because they don't necessarily have to worry about everything being made to order they could have things close to being already made that way it doesn't take that much time to finish preparation.
the ghost kitchen is so dystopian wow
Definitely checked and both Mr Beast Burger and Mariah’s Cookies are available from Buca di Beppo in Cleveland.
Only 1 thing left to Mr.Beast to beat McDonald's: go international!
i was 1 hour late
fnaf fantacy? u and me both!
This is actually a really smart idea.
So when is nickelodeon gonna launch a virtual Krusty Krab
Throw burger made out of money: What a waste of money
wait i searched it up and buca di bepo is actually a restaurant lmfao
I just assumed that Mr Beast opened up a burger shop because he lost a dare
Wow Best way to start off 2021
The only problem is if i wanna buy a burger from Beast Burger it costs 7 bucks then another 7 bucks to get it delivered lol
idk maybe the coffee im drinking right now is made of money. im scared
Mat: A ghost kitchen is a virtual restaurant. Me (who watches waay too much FNAF stuff): It's a GlitchTrap restaurant!  (As a side note, I'm starting to think Mat has a personal vendetta against Mr. Beast because his wife won't stop talking about him being from NC.)
HAHAHAHA YOU CAN'T MAKE ME HUNGRY I WAS EATING A BURGER WHILE WATCHING
This kind of model is fine since they are real restaurants. What I see in Toronto is there are ghost kitchens with addresses that cannot be found - presumably because they are not operating from a real restaurants and thus may or may not comply to sanitation rules for a restaurant.
3:57 is that a rick and morty reference?
is it just me or does matpat find out how to insert fnaf into everything
Between Dad, mr beast, and the other theories you’ve done on YouTubers, you should make a Youtuber Theory
I wish I could learn this in culinary arts
hey mat pat arnt you and scott talking about making irl fnaf ******************* no they cant silence me i ***be *******
shouldnt it be win win win win not win win win because win for the reastraunt win for the devlivery app a win for mrbeast burger and a win for the customer ik i cant spell
I just noticed plankton stealing the krabby patty secret formula in the intro.
"fnaf irl" Matt Patt 2021
Alternate title: Matpat trying to say "buca Di beppo" by saying "bukkadebeppo" for 11 minutes
get me a burger to canada
Shoutout to 4:42 when MatPat compared Mr. Beast Burger to “Any other restaurant” and showed McDonalds, the i Card suggested the video “McDonald’s isn’t a Restaurant”
I didn't even know he made a restaurant. Something I just learned as well that Jacksepticeye made a coffee company so you know what that means? Another coffee theory but with YouTuber coffee if you please?
Are we going to get a crossover with game theory about portal?
Yea I work in a restaurant it’s not that popular(Applebee’s) and we basically have gone all order for a few different companies besides are selfs
Now you need to add a Mrbeast burger to your intro
He has done nothing wrong so don't make your heading negative
Ghost kitchens are the only way I get to order cheesecake factory cheesecakes
Wait I’m sorry did we not know this? He explained this in his video that he is using ghost kitchens to bring food to everyone.  You can’t title the video that it’s “not what YOU think” if it is because I watched the actual video. Come on Matpat I thought you were better than that...
Kinda knew about this but I feel bad for the workers you know the ones actually making and delivering the food who don’t get paid any more even if they have to work at 400% capacity
I was actually expecting for MrBeast to be on the real state game but sure, this also makes sense.
My problem is with places like just wings from chili’s where they are pretending to be a smaller company
Ooolpooo
sunglasses on sunglasses thats when you know your epic
Okay Matt is it time for you to launch Matt's, Matpat pack 😂
I really hope that Mrbeast burger becomes a real restaurant eventually
I watch Jersey Shore ;-; and im a teen.
Thank you MatPat, Very Cool
i am the only one hope that matpat make a restaurants
plot twist. MrBeast is using it to launder money
Funny how MrBeast put you in the rewind and you make this video
I FEEL LIKE CHICKEN NUGGETS NOW
Wait so he opened the restaurant in southlake?? They’re like one of the richest parks of North Texas.
Shut up
1:31 Brewster's Millions PG  1985 ‧ Comedy
You just spell out so much facts and at the end it’s just a theory!
So does the KFC movie video fall under film theory or food theory 🤔
International release when?
Honestly with 2020 btw I'm almost 14, I was able to pick up a hobby I lime doing cooking and you all still need to find something in your interest because we're still in quarantine
I really want mat to talk about people known as food stylists. If you don't know what food stylists is then they're the reason why your mcdonald's burger doesn't look as good as in the ads
Mr beast : opens 300 locations at grand opening   Every fast food restaurant:  name your price   Mr beast : uh it is not for sale but do you want a meal   Every fast food restaurant : uh why though   Mr beats look inside the bag is one mil dollars each ok   Every fast food restaurant: :o
i thought everyone knew this tbh
Can you imagine Scott Cawthon making his own virutal restaurant? Dude would meticulously have toys and colouring books in each meal, all of which had different lore dumps and announcements of planned games... Get on that Mr. Cawthon.
Stfu
POG
Noi Italiani siamo ovunque ;)
The guy is so full of himself. He's exploiting fast food workers AND food delivery people. Literal garbage.
How is this guy not bankrupt!?
But why add glasses on Mr beasts glasses
Just here before mr beast makes a comment
This is very interesting
I do know it's not real
This is going to happen with outback steakhouse
Ghost Kitchen? No wonder there was ectoplasm on my order. Thanks for the good info MatPat
please make a video with u just saying “buca di beppo”
Dang
Yeah my nearby local mall has a brio in it and that’s where my towns BeastBurger is at.
H
No one will eat my food, even if i pay them....
Oh wait bucca de beppo actually exists? XD
All I saw in the beginning was pain
So uh, what would happen if restaurants open back up to in restaurant dining? I'm guessing they would have to cut back on the number of ghost kitchens no?
Mr krabs: No! Thats not how you play the game!
I bet Mr beast will coment on this video
I literally just watched the burger video!
They already have fnaf delivery sorry matpat.
So all you need to get a virtual restaurant is a name and logo  What an impressive business strategy
Tyga bites is actually really good
That’s actually pretty dam cool
Super smart, and saving jobs too during the pandemic.
#swellentertainment
But hey,  that's just the truth! A food truth!
Wow Two videos in one day! Good job!
You have no idea how Mach helpful this is to me ..... Time to find those companies or those spacs heheh.
No more celeb perfume, all Celebes will have signature meals now lol
This reminds me of the MVNO setup for mobile networks. Networks like Tracfone, Net10, and StraightTalk (all the same company btw) all have their own branding and possibly core network, but they use an existing physical network (RAN) to deliver their service.
Im on an add rn and before I skip and watch this episode I'd like to say, yes, yes it is real
Mr beast is taking over America and I'm fine with that.
God I wish he opened a few here in Canada
I just find it messed up that 1 of the weakest of all pandemics has created the largest change.  Perhaps in 2021 we all need to just get over ourselves
Mr.beast is typing... 💬
Great video 👍
I would totally buy food from a Game Theory sponsored FNAF restaurant.
Here’s a theory: Jimmy is actually Scrooge McDuck who is trying to take over United states so he can enslave everyone in the world to work in his mines to build a golden city. Then he will get every scientist in the world to make him a medicine to live forever. He will make the guys who deep froze Disney to deep freeze him self for 10billion years. Before being freezed he will trap everyone in to the mines (that will be pretty big then) so when he will wake up there will be oil and then he will realize he cant use the oil because there is no one else. He tries killing himself but the medicine works so well he cant. He is just in pain. He will live forever alone. Then he falls in love with a bee.
This reminds me of It's Just Wings, which is essentially a delivery-only sister brand offshoot of Chili's. It has been the best bang-for-buck food option for me during this past year.
Bobida BOOPI?
I would love to see Scott make an actual fnaf restaurant, and in there you can find hidden secret lore bits.
bro my name is also mariah  and i kinda despise when people say it tbh
Unfortunately quality control is hard to do with that many ghost kitchens...
Loved the double glasses
Who else is waiting for the blue themed fourth channel?
This channel is more facts than theories
NIKE DEFENCE LEAGUE
POV: you are crying for mrbeast burger because you are in other country
ÑÆĆHØ
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
So now that Matt and Dad have done a crossover, is this channel going to become FOOD Theory instead of Food Theory?       I can already predict people replying like "no you idiot Film Theory and Food Theory are separate channels", and so I'm leaving this disclaimer here to tell you that the comment was a joke.
seems like beast burger has to explain why they feed people paper
I knew about ghost kitchens from doing delivery work and saw Chili's having a delivery only wings menu. Honestly this just makes the argument of the Mr Beast burgers not being good because they were new restaurants invalid as these were restaurants that serve meat since they are an Italian chain. Only argument is they don't know how to cook burgers or chicken properly cause those aren't in their menu.
The intro xD I wasn't one of the Lucky Lads that could get a taste of the BeastFries, or even the Cookie he owes most of us. Despite knowing buildings didn't just sprout from the ground xD I wish I was able to get some food. International is not a thing yet, but one day I'll get a taste (or if travel becomes safer). Also, I had forgotten about that term, gute research & interesting video. Keep being awesome & safe bro, hope you got a taste of something in The Beast Menu (Besides Paper xD)🥤🍔 🐺🍟 😎 👊  1:57 Yeah, but Not international 3:10 Ghost Kitchens 👀 7:12 I figured 10:40 D: 11:05 👀 Best of Luck 👌
0:00     What are you doing😆
So this is the future? One single restaurant can make food for different brands, like if they were a buffet restaurant? Well, that sounds interesting.
We get it, you're richer than all of us combined. Stop bragging.
no no no no no you're not touching  beast burger😡 it's amazing you just don't understand I'm going on subscribe
Nice, but I have never ordered online food from a 3rd party app
must say, money laundering newer seemed so much fun
3:07 Imagine going on a date with a ghoul and almost getting eaten.
Me thinking of mr beast now:  Mr beast watching this: .....
Wow, thats awesome... Ive watched your videos for 4 years now, and I have and idea, for a theory. Its actually a pretty good one, Do you want to hear it?
Who’s else is waiting for MR Beast to comment on this video?
This is really cool but if every restaurant shuts down for good and is delivery only I might lose my mind. I hate staying in this tiny apartment all the time. Part of the appeal of a restaurant is the ambiance and the “getting out of the house” thing
bro im just laughing so hard when he says the bugadebepo name😭😂😂
Non americans be like: 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
10:39 MatPatNotFound
i love the name of the restaurant  it is just like the italian giberish mario and luigi say
Facts
Matpat: Fnaf sister brand does a has nice ring to it   Scott : write that down               write that down
I am not surprised but am VERY pleased to know that even behind the scenes Jimmy is doing EVEN MORE GOOD, and SAVING BUSINESSES, and SUPPLYING JOBS... Is it REALLY too late for “Jimmy for President 2020”?
I’ve been waiting for MatPat to make a theory on this!!!
yea sure mk bud
I hope someone like matpat or anyone makes a Freddy Fazbear Pizzeria Restaurant using a ghost kitchen...
We cant go one episode without a fnaf reference. I’m not complaining. Just saying. Go Matt pat. Oh and also when can we get another fnaf theory?
looks like he's not just a genius on youtube
here before Mr Beast comments on this
How'd he get all his money?
I never thought I'd hear "Buca de Bepo" ever again until now.
The reviewbrah approves of Mr.Beast burger, it's all that matters.
*chan chan*
Mr. Beast is a comrade.
Money has never tasted so good.
This reminds me of that Spongebob Patty Hype episode where they sold so many burgers that they made a free money stand
Mr beast the next richest man in the world
wait wait wait wait wait ... So by Mr. Beast creating these ghost kitchens, he is also taking the blame of undercooked food off his hands as well? I mean they can complain or rate the food lower based on quality on the Mr. Beast Burger website/app, but does that get thrown back on the ghost kitchens since he is paying them to provide a product? So he is dodging any lawsuits if anyone happens to get sick from a really undercooked burger or worse, undercooked chicken? He is trusting these Italian restaurants to provide quality food up to FDA standards. I bring this up since you didn't even touch on it after seeing many posts on Twitter about people having undercooked food. I didn't know how exactly everything worked, but it sounds like he isn't technically liable.
Niko did it first
Didn't JON BON JOVI, actually make the "Free Restaurant?"
He better not be selling mangos
One day, Mr  Beast takes over the fast food world ...  Random journalist: What is your secret Mr Beast ?! We are dying to know!  Mr Beast : you stupid !? I give away cash boi!
Virtual Restaurant = VR
Hey mat Do you think markiplier is real??
I'm actually surprised Scott Cawthon hasn't already approached Chuck E. Cheese with a FNAF based idea.  Heck, before COVID, I was expecting at one Chuck E. Cheese to turn into a Freddy's for Halloween just like 7-Elevens across the US turned into Kwik-E-Marts to promote the Simpsons Movie.  And...given what he did to promote fan projects, I wouldn't be surprised if the idea enters his head for a Freddy Fazbear ghost kitchen as a side hustle to help local restaurants.
Wow, I definitely did not know this 🙄
It's a HOTDOG
Jimmy should see this
only idiots use uber eats, because uber eats charges a 100% fee for delivery, BEFORE adding taxes and delivery fees.
I was worried this would be bad. Mr. Beast is epic
i’m convinced mat pat scrolls on twitter for an hour finds top trending and makes theories like that
I did not expected Mr beast to open  a restaurant
MatPat owns a business?!?
Hey i live in Southlake texas thats really cool
I just hope dining rooms don't die out completely. It'd be sad. Its fun to go to a pretty Restaurant. I'm not talking Fast Food, but actual beautiful Restaurant with service and all.
He should do a theory on which is the best delivery service including Uber eats,Door Dash,and Grub Hub.
Mr.Beast is a saint holier than actual saints. Change my mind
You used the new icon from the NSMB series
If fnaf is a restaurant I’m going there
I’m watching this while I wait for my Taco Bell stuff to get back
The burgers sound great
Is someone going to note that his manager went on record in meeting saying that they're not using ghost kitchens?
It’s free real estate
mat pat how was the FOOD that dad sent you
I thought Buca da beppo was just random words he made a restaurant
The Food Theorists is not real
I’d buy mrbeasts burgers but I aint paying extra for delivery
Ok I’m here to say one thing only ( till I finish the vid ) and that is        The time on this vid is 11:11 (before you click it)
3020th comment!!!
I swear to god if I ever hear the words “booka da beepo” ever again I’m gonna throat punch somebody
There he goes again
How did I miss this?!?
Beast burger is sus!!!!!!12
Having ghost kitchens during the pandemic also gives jobs to the people working at the restaurants. Win win win win!
Something something 😗🚬
Good on the restaurant guy for exploiting the fandom of these ridiculous celebrities
Mr.Beast food it's nothing like FOOD am i right?
9:55 sister brand.. sister location
And I love the fact I can't get any of them In my town yet 🤣 it fills my soul
Five nights at Freddy's sister band  Thinks of fnaf sister location.........
I didn’t even know that mr.beast made that happen?
DONT YOU FUCKING DARE
Imagine the commercials a irl fazbear restaurant could make
press 0:00 multiple times
I can't order MrBeast Burger in New York City 😭
Alternate title: MrBeast is a genius
24 minutes
So now the only reason we’re just living it’s because of food
Ghost kitchen like a ghostwriter, got it
You are sooo right! I live in Arizona and found that Mr Beast and Mariah's cookies both came from the same Scottsdale restaurant----Buca di Beppo Italian Restaurant!!!
Dude why'd you have to come for Jimmy like that
The only reason why I think the food and reviews were so bad was because they struggled to keep up with demand on food, in fact I’m pretty sure they’ll still struggling just not as much as the video was published.
Lol the mrbeast burger near my house also goes through a different bravo!
9:08 Think Mr beast Burgers should be a bit higher just my opinion but he seems a lot more money.
You think too much about FNAF.
i dare you matpat... i dare you to go in on a fnaf restaurant with scott. I.....DOUBLE..... DOG.....DARE.... YOU.
Jimmy is the best business man
Those poor kitchen staff imagine how man different menu items their going to have to learn.
So Nice 💘💘💘💘💘💘
5:24 *That stupid flute plays*
opening up new opportunities for a future career...thanks! ive been struggling a bit trying to figure out what to do with my life when im an adult so this was pretty interesting to me.
big brain time
Sonic approves
Food theories can you tell us if markiplayer is crazy?
Matpat make IRL FNaF restaurant isn't only your fantasy
I'm waiting for Mr.Beast to comment
CORRECT! -Plankton
Are we just not going to talk about how "ghost kitchens" or dark kitchens are being used to exploit workers? You should read "Out of sight, out of mind: inside London’s dark kitchens" if you don't know what I am on about
I'm waiting for MrBeast to comment..
Honestly, this is brilliant. I'm glad Mr. Beast and other celebs are able to keep these places open and jobs available for the staff that works them. Even though it will result in some layoffs (such as servers) it means that not everyone is laid off. This is only a boon to the economy and all of us. The more people employed the better we are.
Big business idea: do this but for all other services... Not just food
McDonald’s watching this:write that down write that down
That’s fucking crazy
Hi
mr beast is a genius
It's 4am and I still haven't watched the whole thing yet
Markiplier isn't real,  the Mr. Beast burger isn't real, next the government is going to start saying Santa's not real!
Notification squad👹
McDonald’s see the video of mr.beast how did they do it
*cries in living in the uk*
Wonder what will Mr. Beast react about this.
'the first free restaurant'  Soup kitchens would like to have a word with you
I predict a bot would say OMG... And add a link
Well I’m happy to be here before MrBeast comments 😊
TIL one of the Theorists lives in my city. I love that Bravo on W Bridge.
Hi
The most ambitious cross over event in history
Wait a minute he said its a waste of money when its free!!!!!!!!! Smh
It’s just is made of PURE money prove me wrong
I’m pretty sure my local Foster Freeze is a ghost kitchen for MrBeast Burger.
I haven’t watched it yet, my guess is it’s basically the McDonald’s system MatPat talked about Edit: I was wrong
Me: looking for an internship at a restaurant Also me: 🤔
4:35 lasses on glasses now thats a BOSS  And also  how many times does matpat say Bucca Di Beppo like bruh
Yes
I haven't had a lot of the menu, so my only bad opinion was not liking the fries
owo
sto telling lies and get a life
Mrbeast most deff. Said that he was online only in his actual restaurants
Fnaf made a cameo... I knew fnaf would make a cameo
fun fact:a comment can only have 500 replies before it caps-
an eatery that gives money away only serves salad
E
Too many videos about youtubers across your channels as of late. Please talk about literally anything else.
I thought they were called cloud kitchens, because there is a Mexican restaurant around the corner from me that only does delivery. I don't think they make other restaurants food. But hey now I know and knowing is half the battle, (sings) G.I. JOE
Mrbeast burger: We made a nation
I've learned so much from this channel, out of all of them food theory is my favorite.
Mat why tf are you not talking about mark?  You are in on all this right? Right?            ..i really hope to become a good theorist like you. So, can you guys please like this i want mat to see it.....  https://youtu.be/mN4kPzp7aKA   1:01 look at what mark is saying..........  I think somehow lunky and darkplier have escaped marks universe to our own reality forcing him to make a confession which possibly not real......after that i think this is leading to the hiest with markplier or even darkplier and i think it will be something to defeat lunky the prize.And if its not really a hiest with markiplier wich is gonna happen then we know its gonna come around soon as mark was talking about it in one of his vedio about how the work was going in a full blow........thats my theory please share yours Also, Matpat got it right or wait maybe matpat is also involved and did it on purpose....... I seriously dont know, I mean, What the heck? #markiplierisntreal Plus why isint matpat talking about it? He is definitely involved!(as he had a theory in which he pointed out how markiplier isint real you should go check that vedio out it is related to this big mess) Also i think markiplier is a character but Mark Fishbach is not so it can be a universe made by real life mark and well markiplier is not real?..... Oh god  Thoughts?
It would be difficult to explain these negative costing burgers to the IRS.
That was faster than the others to get into what the episodes answer
How about instead: **Food Theory, I smarter way to eat** | Honestly you can just have that. I think its a better slogan.
Ya that's not even a theory that's just a food fact
Waiting for mrbeast to comment
The dad channel shoutouted matpat in a new video today
MrBeast is great, but the burgers are overpriced. They also need a bit more flavor
Ok i want to ask something : How did Mr Beast make all that money?
U fake
i'm glad this wasn't a bad thing about mr beast!
Why
4:21 it's a win win win win. You forgot the customer
Hmmm, maybe someone can use the same model for short term tie-in promotions, like a limited time FNAF to coincide with the release of a new game or book, a movie tie-in with a restaurant that exist only in a movie or series, like Star Trek DS9 Quark's Bar. I can see a lot of potential for niche, limited time chains.
Them intros keep getting more Foreshadowy.
Reality is an illusion, the universe is a hologram.
Yes Sister Location
Amazing xD
I call ghost kitchens cloud kitchens
can we just appreciate how much detail is in the intro video?
Jokes aside this is actually helpful and very revealing and it could save a bussiness
It’s real
It's true
It tastes like paper....      Wait..             *It’s made from money...*
i really watched 10 minutes of him explaining that mrbeast used a ghost kitchen even tho i already knew that
None of them Deliver in Oregon
I'm going there anyone wanna join?
Little nightmares theory pls
shopmrbeast.com
@mrbeast
Z
I'm still eating it
Buca di beppo best fast food.chain ever
Am I the only one that is disappointed he didn’t actually order from mr.beast burger this entire video 🙁
I love your theory
I should have seen this coming
Dang calling him out!
Scott Cawthon should start his own food brand,restaurant,menu ,you know ,FNAFrelated
Hey guys! I hope you have a nice day and stay safe, God bless you! <3 :D
Ok here's the real question who's richer mr beast or Jeff Bezos cause I'm confused?
pog
Would we see any food theory episodes based on food outside the states, like what is a full English breakfast?
How is this a theory
Food theory became my favorite theory channel
Matpat should make an irl fnaf restaurant with Scott worldwide
Let’s hope he doesn’t cover that food from his doorstep
I the word Italian so much in this video and now I’m hungry  I LOOOOOOVVVVVVVEEEEEEEE Italian food soooo much
The most amazing fact I learned in this video is that Buca di Beppo is an actual restaurant.
I figured out how he does it: Mr. Beast has the Milagro Man stand
I can't just sleep, can I?
I didn't need to hear MatPat say that Pauly D is DTF
How was your burger? Me: yes
#politics
Sotry but if you diss mrbeast i diss you
Good job mat pat
No one calls you mac daddy
Here before Mr beast
Why are you put Jimmy sungllases cos he had arledy
Mr beast restaurant looks good
They need quality control at these locations and customer support. A lot of the items from my mr beast order were not cooked.
I can honestly see this business model be used for filmmaking; ghost studios! Imagine indie filmmakers with chump change who wants to make the next blockbuster, but don't have the resources or the space to make one. Idk if this is something that already exists, but if it doesn't, it would be cool.
video idea: which is the cheapest food delivery app?
Having your own restaurant you say?? How about all the menu options are recipes/ foods that you have covered (that includes tree)? Just a thought
it would be cool if all of that was a worldwide chain restaurant
In and out’s main strategy is to take it slow and steady
me:matpat can surprise me by ruining Beast Burger.me: surprised that he didn't ruin it he made it better
Whenever MatPat says virtual: I see trees and green
So I just got a McDonald’s add...
You chose that example restaurant purely because it's fun to say didn't you?
When did you make this channel?
Yeah when I tried to find one in my area and said the address was Buca that definitely confused me lmao
Couple: *goes to Buca Di Beppo* do you smell cookies? Nah that can’t be it.
Pog mr beast is big brain for using ghosts to cook for him
Bad choice of picking In & Out as the comparison. They are infamous for not expanding when they can.
At first I thought you were trying to shame Mr. beast with all his restaurants
Mr beast on Kitchen Nightmare?
OK but if Mr. beast sees this i’m a need you to open one in Dothan
Mrbeast: Come get my burgers! His fans: OMG BURGERS FROM MY FAV YOUTUBER! AnD I GET TO MEET HIM Random people: *free money*
OMG GUYS LOOK WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO PEWDIEPIE OMFG           https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
Me: Sees title “It’s made of people!”
I still can recover from that pun at the start
Scott you heard the man
Last costumer:I ate so much  McDonald's arlready.    Mr beast: Gimme my money back big boy
Ok so can the bots just stop linking a vid that has nothing to do with the vid.
Mr. Beast ✅ uh.....well...sh-
It’s painful to see other people live out your dream.
Mr Krabs has finally found his enemy.
Not to mention the people he scammed into buying his Mr. Beast shirts!
i feel like its true and not true?
FNAF THEOR NEW CHANNEL VIDEOS A MOUTH 36 MINUTES LONG EACH ALL ANIMATION.
Yummy
My burger was pretty darn good!
Cool, and probaly real LoL
Jimmy’s gotta be careful, if he keeps multiplying restaurant in the U.S. he might get dissed by Wendy’s
When you use Monney as a Napkin 😂
When are you just going to start a 'the conspiracy theorist' channel since more or less many of your recent videos certainly reference some? This is an honest question considering I don't believe all conspiracy theorists are wrong in the same sense a square can be a rectangle but a rectangle is not a square. Without accurate measurements it's all about perspective. Perspective which I believe your channel can bring.
in and out was a terrible comparison they dont want to expand
Wait what?! Jimmy has a restaurant!?
Does anyone else like the way he says "Buca du Beppo?"   Just me....ok.....
[Comment Deleted]
Oh god
Mr. Beast burger: Starts Whataburger, In-N-Out Burger, McDonalds: *heavy breathing*
I will only subscribe to mrbeast if he can feed the whole world and get rid of world hunger

Our Mr Beast order got messed up by Uber Eats, and we were delivered Tyga Bites instead. Didn’t know they were both from the same place 👀   (We got our food in the end, took a bit)

Mad pat restaurant the food restarent.
Mathew Pathew is talking about Dad and then Mr Beast? Wow.
it doesn't count until his chain comes to alaska
Those people with their noses sticking out of their masks working in restaurants....pretty disgusting. I prefer my food clean. Hold the coronavirus.
Oh no imagine a five nights at Freddy’s but it’s delivery... maybe the animatronics deliver to your house? Maybe you need to deliver to other houses and... well I don’t know but I think it has potential and can be a very interesting game to play :)
💛
Here before mrbeast
Scot if you see this make fasbears a real thing to hype up securety breaches launge i need this piza extra dicusting plz
Oooooo
Does Mr. Beast burger still give out burger for free?
Fun fact:you wanna try the burger
Just ordered my first mr beast burger and matpat is right. My burger is coming from a Bertucci's lol.
No, no, He has a point
When I saw that title I thought MrBeast put poison Olin the burgers or spitting in them
How dare you jab the Jersey shore fam 😆
Next MrBeast idea: OPENING AN ANIMATRONIC ENTERTAINMENT PIZZERIA
Mr Beast: Lets Matpat on his Channel Matpat In The Thumbnail : Burger Not Real lol
Haha RIP me
Mr. Beat's manager actually has a YouTube channel called creator economics where he discussed a little bit about the creation of Mr. Beast Burger. It's pretty interesting
yay more capitalism to strangle people with
All of this was already said by mr beasts manager on a podcast
guys if you look at some replies you'll see this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFEaLZGoktw&feature=youtu.be
Great vid Matt, I didn’t even thought something like that already works, ghost kitchens. Brilliant!
SCOTT JUST MAKE IT HAPPEN ALREADY
Everyone's talking about Mr. Beast, but Virtual Dining Concepts is mind blowing to me. It's such a good business idea. Striking at the perfect time too. Robert Earl took 2020 and made it print money for him.
lol
Could you do a film theory, on initial d on whether takumi delivers tofu or drugs? Plz
Mr. feast
Anyways, how's the weather in Washington DC, hope no beheadings yet.😂
jimmy is talking the world vote him for president
I liked this video.
Him: See a 100 dollars. aslo him: this napkin sucks.
me hearing Brio: PASTA ALLA VODKA 😍
Not available where I live /:
Glad to see you’re back after your last Film Theory video’s insanity.
Dad know all
Matt: "Brick and Mortar"  Me: "Rick and Morty??"
Mr beast is actually a mob boss and is pulling in millions every week plot twist
I Hate Bots That Spam Stuff.
Wait this is a channel
Buca bi beppo sounds funny
I ordered a $15 burger from them and it was just foster’s freeze      It was gross
Calling out Mr.Beast this is going to be interesting...
A lizard disapproves of the beast burger
WHAT IS IT ABOUT MR BEAST HE GIVES YOU MONEY IDIOT
what's with LA residents and Bucca di Beppo?
Here I thought Buca di Beppo was a mishmash of sounds he came up with for the video
Nothing delivers to me, I live 20 mins outside a college town full of delivery option. :(
Bravo italian food: Sister Location.
Only theory I can agree with you
Okay....
What about Markiplier? 😫😭
#MatPatShouldMakeFNAFaRealResteraunt
next level big brian from beast but he needs money for vidios
Hi
Huh he has a restaurant i thoght IT was a macdonald burger
I thought niko omilana had the first free burger restaurant
Hiya !
Neat
MrBeast pls reply to my comment
Hey Matpat and everyone there's a video from Mr. Beast's manager about this. I think it's a great watch with this video  https://youtu.be/TLShN0IK__A
now we need mrbeast to say its true
Can we get some theory nuggets in the future please
beware of dad
Matpat: Come to think of it Five Nights At Freddy's Sister Brand does has a nice ring to it Fnaf Sister Location: *Am I a joke to you?*
I love Mr beast
No one last you mat whoever control DAD now control you if you eat the  food
How did your F.o.o.d taste?
Loved the intro
Hey, Matthew Patthew, how are you enjoying F O O D?
Are you continuing to eat your FOOD? #DADJoke
Mr. Beast and Mr. B.
Only the real ones know where the “new” sign (7:16) is from
Actually this is starting to make sense
Who else never heard of Buca di beppo?
Plot twist: MrBeast got the meat from his tiger.
mr beast is so good it has its own theory
Matpat are you okayafter eatingdads F.O.O.D
Bro that type of app was a huge success before the pandemic too in india like swiggy and zomato
First subway breadthatsnotactuallybread then markiplier and now beast burger!? Man nothings real these days.
Bro meeting jimmy is a business opportunity at this point
Grubhub: *shows up*  Memers: *delivery dance intensifies*
The best intro I have ever seen I laughed
Great so everyone makes a bit of cash where everyone thought they were lost, no really I think it's creative and brilliant my only gripe is that rebranding is just rebranding the difference from the normal menus may offset this slightly, but if a ghost kitchen is just rebranding then what about the quality control??? What I'm saying is does rebranding, in this case, change the fact that certain business practises are still in the kitchens in the first place. therefore if a kitchen, say served a pizza or food item the wrong way for years, wouldn't that just translate to the virtual kitchen and leave the end consumer with bad or misleading food? I hope this makes sense and let me know what you think.
So mrbeast is fake
Hi daddy pat
Oh, rip
Oh! It's like Dumb Starbucks but done right.... I see.
Watching Food Theory while starving on the job is not the best idea.
I haw nevee orderd food not even in 2020 CAUS IM IN SWEDEN so yea
i am not even mad... this is genius...
It's the restaurant equivalent of having roommates to help pay the rent!
Me desliking the thump nail but likein the subject love you Matt pat
So basically, restaurants have side hustles now?
#MrBeast #MrBeastBurger #FastFood Food Theory: MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think. lol
Deit   coke mat pat edition!
Great video and cool theory
Oh thank goodness, I thought Dad had gotten ya
If anyone has noticed TYGA did somewhat the same by opening TYGA BYTES  a restaurant ran soully off of postmates
i ordered mr beast burger and it was delicious tho 🧍‍♀️
🏓
Y on earth do mr bests have a restraint
YouTube now-a-days is an odd thing...
bone apple tea
Anyone else think that the way he joked about FNAF restaurants becoming real sounded like he knew something, probably just wishful thinking but I would 100% go to one of those
Did he just said what a waist of money
didn't everyone already know this?
Didn’t mr beast himself say this in the video tho? At least I understood that from his video
Marketing
I’m just gonna act like I didn’t know all of this since the start
I’m still waiting on my AirPods from Halloween
theres a mr beast burger?
Matt nuggets and teory dip
I have a theory that MatPat made this episode to set up a chain of Food Theory restaurants. But that's just a theory!
I’m so glad mr beast wasn’t added to fortnite, cuz if he was added kids would be callin it, “fortnite man borgor”
I already learned this from ReviewBrah, but I couldn't turn down a Food Theory video.
Made out of beast
What if it was all just a dream
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Cz-yvLb0YeU
Everyone look at this food theory episode it’s super cool go watch it here’s a link https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
i guess matpat likes buca di bepo i mean he said it alot
OK mat DAT intro
The Carrabba's Italian Grill I work at is about to become a ghost kitchen for a virtual restaurant called "Tender Shack" in Raleigh, NC. I didn't realise this was a widespread thing, this is some knowledge I can apply to my real life. 🥰
The dum sums in Twitter watching this are  speechless
Stop the cap matpat
its normall for parkland wonders businesses to give money 1s the payment for the amount goes negative
Hello, internet! Welcome to Conspiracy Theory - I mean Food Theory
Sounds like TeslaBurger. Blech!
b
what if Mrbeast actually commented on this?
It's weird to hear the word Jersey shore because here in England it's called Geordie Shore
i have decided to make my own burger place to rival in n out but with better fries
I just hope he is using meat from animals from good farms were they were treated well and not just cheap meat...
As someone with fatal food allergies-these ghost kitchens feel very scary.   Finding a single restaurant that has nothing on the menu that is dangerous and thus a lower risk of cross contact accidents is bloody hard enough...  The idea that multiple restaurants are all working out of the same kitchen?  Ugh.
Just wait a few hours for Mr. Beast to comment on this video.
Loving it matpat!
Wait umm im from the DAD thing
41 minutes ago
I want so bad a Fnaf themed restaurant! It'd be so cool!
I think there is one problem that is in Mr Beast restaurants' plan, food quality. If he doesn't manage to maintain his food quality then his brand means nothing
People really be making weird theories about restaurants even though they've never even tried the food from those restaurants.
A resturaunt chain that gives away electronics and free money that sounds like the most american thing ever
Why
*stokks*
Hope he goes to Canada
My mother rents a kitchen from a converted school for a coffee shop.  She shares the rent with a pre-made-meal cook and let's them keep their stock out for sale during the day.  Mom makes coffee during the day and she cooks at night when the stop isn't open
The Burger is a lie
It was only a matter of time
I picked up a delivery for both Mr Beast Burger and Mariah’s Cookies just yesterday from Bertucci’s, while working for DoorDash. It is great for us drivers as well, picking up food orders from the same place.
This changes my view on this 100%!!! Thank you!!
easiest way to get sales, give out a hundred bucks once every hundred sales.  (you will certainly make more on the sales then you do on the spending of the hundred, especially if you have a minimum purchase price)
MAT DONT EAT THE FOOD FORM DAD
Sister brand=Sister LOCATION
The normal seasoned fries are ok. Besides that it kinda sucks. Even the Pepsi.
"I was just a business man, doing business"
m
EARLY KINDA?!?!
There’s exactly 11:11 long
8:59 GIVE ME RENT
Am i the only one who read the thumbnail and thought "it can't hurt you"?
My question is, is the money taxed cuz if it's not not much you can buy besides like a ton of clothes
I expected it to be the largest fastest growing drug running cover up but ok
Every restaurant can be free if you get away without paying.
Get your "here before MrBeast comments" ticket by liking.
Me: **just watching Film Theory's episode of Deadpool 2**  Food Theory: *Let me introduce myself.*
Now i'm waiting for professional ghost kitchens.
Video theory: Food/Film/Game/Music theory just makes up random theories and doesn't actually do research.
But what mythological creature's lifeforce is tied to the franchise?
9:58 I live In that Area
Where the heck does he get his money???????????
Its not just a restuarant theory ,its a ghost restuarannt theory thhhanks for reenting
Wonder McDonald's business model working out especially against  ghost kitchens
I like how he put glasses over his glasses on one part
man... i wanted to life in usa rn...
What if part of Mrbeast was in the borger
Wait if restaurants were to be given 4 types of celebrity brands  *Wouldn't that increase they're earnings by 4x*
That's honestly amazing. He's saving so many jobs and helping stabilize the economy extremely.
Fun fact.  I am morbidly obese
i like your montage i hope i will be like you
Im speedrunin these
oh no

Meow subscribe
Waiting for mr.beast to comment
My broke self over here like.. MR BEAST PLEASE BUY ME A HOUSE !!!!!! I NEED A NEW HOUSE!!!!
took me till the end of the video to find out that buca di beppo is an actual restaurant
Don’t forget to eat your FOOD
I have a theory MatPat is gonna try to team up with Scott Cawthon to make a Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria restaurant like this
I've never watched a single Mr Beast video, but I absolutely love this guy. Not many businessmen like him
The consistency of these videos are superhuman like what
That was wild.
This is one of the smartest ideas I've ever heard about in my life
4:40 - yeah using a brand name to sell a product that no-one would ever buy,  The concept is not new, had you heard of PATANJALI,  The one reason of there sudden growth was the brand name given to other products.
I recently learned that coyotes are faster than roadrunners... Waiting for the theory.
Pretend i said something funny
Nobody: Mr Beast in the past: where gonna blow op this Mr Beast now: Free money
What about the F.O.O.D?
Hi
home of the BIG MAT?!
Me who can even buy a proper yoyo online and in the shops: *sad noises*
So when people complain abt Mr. Beast burgers for being horrible like having under cooked burgers or messed up orders, it’s not only JUST the employees fault but the BRAVO employees
I bet the Seko Seko 6 bot is gonna reply on my comment
i can't belive people don't do that in the US... here in argentina is super common to eat throught a "ghost restaurant"
I'm just sad that the closest beast burger is in utah
This makes me think MatPat will make a Food Theory resturaunt. Menu: Edible chistmas tree Uneven pizza Spathcocked turkey Kool Aid (comes with the Kool Aid Man comic!) Froot Loops mixed with Applejacks Etc.
One of the best starting puns
we already know mr beast burger is made by other restaurants that don't get alot of play please stop matpat
Who else just likes hearing MatPat say Buca di beppo
get the social blade addon and look a the stupid tags that are on this
'What a waste on money' the napkins: The F&@k You Say To Me You Little S@$t?!
Let me guess: Real estate
Matpat: how??? MrBeast: I’m not going to tell you Me: FREE REAL ESTATE!!!
It was only a matter of time...
dude, how is this mans so smart?
Well I sure know theres alot of uncooked burgers there
It's wierd when game theory keeps saying 2020 when it's not
Fun fact: After Mat said buca di beppo, you repeated it coupled times.
I like that you keep using Buca di Beppo as an example, since it is literally one of the ghost kitchens operating as Mr Beast Burger, haha.
10:27 is that harry styles?
Here it is!
Wouldn’t the staff be overwhelmed it’s 4 restaurants into 1 ??
I've been waiting for a theory on this!
FNAF irl, matpat, I don't want to die
Nobody else is concerned about how Matpat wants FNAF to be real?
Ghost kitchens are a great idea on so many levels, and I encourage struggling independent restaurant owners to borrow the idea to stay open. However, I think I'll stick to my dine-in only restaurants, thank you.
Also, the Pauly D DTF pun is probably my favorite non-Mr. Beast part of the episode
Me when I see this: *Why hello*
Mr.Beast must comment LoL
Early?
Mr beastburger is the opposite of McDonald's
Dad Approves!
It's 3 am and THIS is what I see at the time where I should be sleepin'..  Ugh... Fine this the last video to watch on yt
7:55 i got the reference
When will he post the next fnaf theory video on game theory
Say it with me Buca de Pepo
This Ghost Kitchen concept is a pretty good idea. I can see this being the future of the restaurant industry.
I WANT TO BE THE LAST COUSTERMER
I used to be a dishwasher but, when my restaurant rehires me, I will have to take on a new role and get retrained.
Okay yeah but can we talk about how fun Buca de Beppo is to say?
Tick tock tick tock. The clock is running...
ITS REAL FOR ME
✨✨✨
Btw have you guys watched dad's new video???  He was talking about this YouTube channel
That wasn't a theory. That was common knowledge.
Beast burger isnt in my state so i cant try this.
I already knew this
2,150th!
Huh, neat.
That's a bit of a reckless stunt to be pulling off during a pandemic
What’s up mrbeast all the people love you
Its 3 am  Now....  Im hungry
MRBEAST REMOVES MATPAT FROM 2020 YOUTUBE REWIND 😂😂😂
image mrbeast saw this video
"Food Theory: MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think..." It's exactly what we think....
YwY
Alternative title: MrBeast won’t comment on this video
Matpat you should make your own "restaurant"
Mr Beast is a mad genius
In reality as long as food standards are still met, then I have no objection to variety of delivery options without the need for more real estate for tables
Markiplier isn’t real
Me an international fan knowing I can't get a Mrbeast buger: Sad Crusader noises.
matpat in intro what a waste of money me and most of the people wait don't you get money as napkins?
RIP MRBEAST
what’s the thing with italian restaurants
Now we need a matdonalds
Holy crap! Someone did a similar video and released it today too! - https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
wtf it's not real??
Random people 30 mins after the video comes out be like: first
I hated that video. People lining up for miles to get free stuff instead of working for it. People are so pathetic.
Don't think we have anything like that in Canada (at least in my province anyway)
Mrbeast: *says he want’s to die with no money in his bank account* Also Mrbeast: *charges people money for burgers*
So, is MrBeast Burger an actual restaurant while McDonalds isn't an actual restaurant?
Just go to Pizza Time Pizza.
This is not a theory this is an explanation
Of course....
Scott Cawthon shoulder this
B
This is literally capitalism seizing the means of production omfg
The fact that there’s a way for mat-pat to combine food theory and online theory is amazing timing that’s the best thing 😅
Man, I was wondering where everyone was getting a Mr.Beast Burger, and it was online
Imagine if Scott gets on this to bring Freddy’s to life
Today I just bought my most terminally ill fan his replacement heart
Hi.
How is he not bankrupt now
With that model then its just a matter of time until someone pulls of a world wide scale
ITS MY MOM BIRTHDAY PLSSS WISH HER HAPPY BIRTHDAY :D
Either he didn’t go to business school or he went to the best business school 😁😁
It’s 2021 not 2020 .
i love this
Video: 21 minutes ago  Random Comment: 23 minutes ago  Me: wha—
What happened to this channel my dude
MatPat please make a theory on cookies 🍪 🥺 they are delicious and you could yak about... uh... subways’ cookies? Maybe or ummm... why people like cookies o much?
2:09 why is that phone upside down
He has a point you don't spend 300 new restaurant that will took year of making money + Mr beast is spend a lot from challenges  So if he biuld new restaurant it could  not paying taxes
Ok I thought the episode was going to be about "how the burgers are actually made of money" because of the opining gag and now I feel dumb
32 mins ago pog
Cool
How dare thou
You heard first it here folks MatPat not approved  Edit: Food theory
This is literally "The four horsemen of rich"
Noice!This theory burger tastes correct!
Jimmy - Opens A Restaurant  Food Theory - Let Me Show You How We Roll
*sniff sniff* I smell a monopoly in coming
Mrrrrr beeeasssttt 6000 owaoooooooo
Now do a video about the Quantum Burger stunt Xbox Canada did in 2016.
Mom: what time did you sleep? Me: 4 maybe 5 am Mom: what. What did you do!?!??? Me: watch matpat talk about restaurant  Mom: understandable have a nice day-
And second thing why i think mrbeast launched restaurant in delevery apps is the line that would be in the restaurant anytime
its funny how this video is recent and comments have more likes then the video
I got an ad from postmates lol
This video was like the Spanish Inquisition for me, it was unexpected
I'm surprised. I live in Austin, Texas. None of these foods are available in my area.
lol
Today’s my birthday
Hi
Uh oh
"MrBeast is NOT a real restaurant" Well, based on McDonald this is not a restaurant, A REAL STATE COMPANY
Ooooo
300 locations? I wonder what is there exact ghost restaurants that are available now from the person?
(Funny comment that hopefully gets likes)
And of course there aren’t any SC locations
Mr beast when mat does this: hahah, I made a airport
I never would have guessed that there would be a video on this, even though I saw the launch of this
This is such a smart idea!
Do a theory on bugsnax please
Welcome to the conspiracy theorists
Hi
If a real FNaF restaurant were to happen. They obviously need Scott Cawthon since he's the game creator, Bring MatPat on as Marketing Research, ZHC could draw art on the walls inside the restaurant, MrBeast could supply the Kitchen with the highest quality kitchen equipment, and maybe Mark Rober (with Scott's help) could design the animatronics, and even make Animatronics popular again!  A wanna see this team of YouTubers build a restaurant from the ground up
Thanks ! Super sketchy feeling of this truth instead of saying it is their burger making it out of their Mrbeaste way. Now I'm never gonna think about buying one cause why buy food who isn't made by yours truly (:
Why haven’t Mr. Beast commented?
lol
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Film Theory - Film Theory?
I swear I see a new Easter eggs in the opening every time
Can you do a theory on uncharted for the new movie
Unfortunate for the climate and those who don't eat meat that it's got no vegetarian options, if he's still into climate activism maybe he'll try adding that though
I didn't even know he opened a restaurant. Cool!
future:- many famous people will hope in the fast food trend and will have their menu. Many restaurant and business will open their door to it.
Dumb question, but do all of those people have to pay taxes on Mr. Beasts "gifts"? Like the brand new cars?
I know this is irrelevant but I just had the best orange ever
If mr.beast doesn’t comment I’m gonna die
Bro I would eat at a mat pat restaurant
I suddenly want to invest in the stock of ghost kitchens
*Duel of the Fates starts playing.
cool idea
If there is not a fnaf restaurant in the well by 2030 this world ain’t worth
If there is ever a Food Theory restaurant I would eat there 🦊
*MrBeast Burger opens* McDonalds & KFC & Pizza hut: Ima head out
Nope not going to be ordering from virtual restaurants
Mrbeast will maybe see this video
Still waiting the arrival of Mr.Beast
Do a restaurant called chef theorist
Next Video: Burger King Burgers AREN'T Burgers
Mat you released this video at the perfect time. Most British people are just finishing eating then we watch a video about food it's amazing.
fun fact: cow-bison hybrids are called "beefaloes"
how long did it take you to make this video because i hate to be a jerk but ALOT of people already know this about the ghost kitchens :/
I'll be waiting on that Theorist Professional University from MatPat
In n out could probably have more locations, but they are exclusive to the west
OMG! MATPAT! You’re ok. Dad is starting to scare me
Mariah Carey s cookies taste like barf
Mr Feast 😂😂😂😂
The judge: Mr matpat is it true that you  committed a third hand clickbait Matpat: yes The people around: what hhhaa Judge: order in the court order in the court, mr matpat you are sentenced for one week of #matpatoverparty
XD i love this
Fun Fact: Mat Pat is first.
Mans really didn’t do a theory on the travis scott burger
wait!      BUCCA DE BEPPO is a REAL resturant!!??
I know it’s not real bc it’s actually “burger boy” this happen in my little city in North Carolina ... I rode by but refused to stop lol... but burger boy does have good food 🤣🤣🤣
Mr beast to Mr feast 😂😂
I propose a theory to explain how matpat is still sane after running 3 theory channels
WHAT
hamburger
Came here to hear about Mr. Beast (despite not really being a fan), left here with a better look at humanity!
And 1900 comment
1,924th comment
Hi
"Business is booming" *-MrBeast*
I would totally go to a mat Donald's lol
Good research! Respect to you and your team MatPat. You get the things quite accurate as they are!
90k viewer
mr.beast is prob crying while watching this lmao
Hi matpat!!!!!
MrBeast friends make money by having fun.     Thats the life...
They should call him Jimmy McDonaldson.
As a non american, when i heard "buca de beppo" i thought that was the most childish and lazy fake name ever. Now that i know it's a real chain, i am only more dissapointed
Yes
Do tenticles enter the dolphin
11:11 watch time. Make a wish.
9:07 GiVe mE rEnT
Nouice
So MatPat has 30 days to give us his own restaurant
All of this makes me want to eat all of the foods that matpat said or it’s it just me
I wish i can get a mrbeast burger
Wow
Hey MatPat,  when will you do a theory on those 'markiplier isn't real' videos that keep popping up on markiplier channel.
Once the quarantine ends, I'll go back to periodically eating out.
Ihe should hire animatronics to deliver food  And make them  fnaf like
Before watching  it imma guess he’s gonna say that it’s not a place you just order it from some random restaurant that makes it lol
I was his 50 millionth sub. I got 50 million Beast Burger's
Eat some burger from mrbeast and when u tried to eat cheese filling like gold
el maau saco que salchicha primero
So... can we assume matpat is already talking to scott about those fnaf irl ghost restaurants?
I am 83,420th  I’m not lying I checked the view count
Mr beast : you better say it’s just a theory
Cool im so quick on this video didnt know he had a virtual kitchen and also the other people that i dont care about use the same ghost kitchen
Yeah my city j got one of these expansion ones and it’s pretty good
I dont care what taste that has. As long as it reaches europe, I like it. Seriosly,  the next Burger King is 60 km away.
Imagine this getting pinned
Do you think the beef on MRBEAST burgers are made out of money but hey that's just a theory a food theory and cut
Im going to ask my dad about this lol
The Ghost Kitchen I sometimes order from here in Toronto has about 7-8 brands operating out of the building. Interesting thing is though, if you buy something from a different brand you can tell it's made with the exact same ingredients. They make good food, but that is kind of interesting, as it seems to destroy the purpose. I wonder if that's the case with other Ghost Kitchens as well @The Food Theorists
So, the electric company approach, smart.
straight up thought buppedibeco was made up my mat...
Its Just  MrBeast is super kind and is very rich and can afford resturants. All it is The Food Theorists are jeilouse they cant do that
Wendy's: *We have competition now*
what a dope scam
Nam nam
Hey I'm early
Mrbeast: *sees video*  Also Mrbeast: *I'm about to ruin the man's whole career*
I tought dad gave you some FOOD™
Sounds like communist take over but ok... 3:00
STOP METPET STOP THE FOOD NOT THE FOOD IN THE VIDEO THE FOOD STOP DON'T EAT THE FOOD
26 minutes ago bois
MrBeast is by FAR the best person, morally, on YouTube. He gives away money, happiness, food, everything. He doesn't keep it for himself. He spreads it out to the public. It's awesome.
i like how jimmy has 2 glasses LOL
The next food theory:Does stuffed crust fill stuff you faster than not stuffed crust
Decent video! Thanks for uploading!
When they gonna come to  brasilp
Wut happen to petscop
Eat your can of food.
I couldn’t even have a chance of getting one cause I live in pa, edit: USA but in a more unknown area
Hi my people
I personally think the burgers taste may have been a placebo; this being because the actual taste could have been a brain trick in which the thought of the consumer knowing they not only got food and other goods for free, but also because it was coming from a famous person; in conclusion this consumer may have partaken in a self delusion that would make the taste of the burger a placebo in which this consumer is simply pleased by the variety of goods they received upon requesting the burger in the first place
Mr beast brgr
You're still pronouncing pasqualy's wrong
25?
Has anyone see all the Easter eggs that Matt has an all his videos? Should there be a film theory episode about all his episodes? Or is that too meta?
It has crack
For that I'll give this video a dislike
Delivery sucks and the food arrives in a crap condition and taste.  I don't about the rest of you but I would never want to have delivery fries.
Have you seen the game called "Moon sliver" I know this is food theory but I would love to see you make a theory about it
This has quickly become my favorite theory channel
I was already two parallel universes ahead of you
So are the burgers good? I want to try it now
Give away 1million, gain 3million. Mr beast pretends to be charitable, but it’s all one big publicity stunt to make more money, stop (or if you haven’t already stop) falling for it.
"Win, win, win."   Wow didn't expect Sir Hammerlock from Borderlands 2 to be quoted here.
And Matt Pat is wrong about Mr beast burger
My youtube is glitching and it says this vid has 5 views.... ??
10:34 I was JUST thinking that. Man, if Scott did that then that would be amazing.
Claim your “here before mr beast commented” ticket here
AIRPODS. guess the headphone jack is on it's lasts legs. Once a champ, now when apple removed it everyone did.
Love your videos matpat keep going
Hi
When MatPat says Mr.Beast's real name. (Jimmy Donaldson)
I am sad. It is not called chotobe
Did anyone find anything DAD related in this?
I get why ur pissed HE NEVER ADDED U IN THE YOUTUBE 2020 REWIND
We always order wings from a place called It's Just wings but but it's really just Chili's lol.
;)
I don't  care what Matt Pat says I'm sure Mr beast burger is good
its just a burger.
Mr beast is actually surprisingly smart
What it is a poison
So ghost kitchens are the middlemen in the same way a printing company can be a middleman for somebody's merch.
Mr Beast is running a money laundry front in a form of a restaurant.  That's right all that was DIRTY MONEY and all of them are assecories to Mr Beast's many crines.
it is posionous rats
Just saying          the  Uk will never get to taste these....things...        thankfully        no but seriously no offence MRbeast I just don't feel good about a youtuber making food
My restaurant runs 3 ghost kitchens. All of the delivery drivers get very confused when they come into our biergarten (that sells hotdogs and burgers) looking for the plant based restaurant we work as well.
Mr. Beast one of the smartest businessman ever.
ROBERT AND ROBBIE IF YOU CAN HEAR ME YELLING PLEASE GET YOUR RESTAURANTS IN SOUTH INDIA RIGHT NOW PLEASE
4:31 none: mr.beast: sunglasses on sunglasses
It's just like "It's just wings" on door dash. I believe they operate out of chili's kitchen.
Fun fact: jimmy and mat are really good friends so may and him probably have some money deal arranged for this
BOTS I INVOKE YOU
I'm early.
Yes. Give me that yummy theory knowledge
So it's literally just a random restaurant rebranded and uncharged? No thanks.
McBeast Burgers, uh? Epic
When i got it the grilled cheese wasn’t even grilled...
why would my homie mr.beast
You can't trick me MatPat. You chose Buca di Beppo as an example because it's fun to say.
When release food theories its 9 o' clock where I live. You make me hungry
Mr Beast is a fraud.
what about the fact that they are also designing mega kitchen complexes which is just 10 to 20 kitchens in one building only designed to be multiple delivery only restaurants with no brick and mortor restaurant at all
once you think he is selling out he pulls a sneaky on ya
I wonder if the intro will evolve like the Game Theory intro.
3:08 is that a tokyo ghoul reference
Mat: mentions a bunch of food delivery services Me: *Sad Glovo noises*
hi
Dang it came out 20 min. Ago and theirs so many comments
Do a theory on the smile packet things the Mablie eats in gravity falls episode titled, “The inconveniencing” in that episode mayble eats a ton of these packets that are told not to be sold.
hi
Anybody else just stare at the freddys pizzeria in the intro?
hi
Day 5 of saying Matpat should do a jjba theory.
Dont mind me just waiting for the beast to comment on this video
hi
E
hi
that burgerchain doesn't exist here in europe (at least not in germany). So the only reason I clicked is that I like MapPat to just entertain me a bit.
Hiiiiiiiiiiii
hi
I am so jealous of you Americans who have all these fancy delivery apps ):
wait, Buca de bepo is real?
Mrbeast burger taste like caca
With how many times he's mentioned FNAF, i think he may be 4shadowing something.
I just want one in canada
This man can sell anything!
here before 1m views
cheezey hamburger
matpat saying “buca di beppo” just became my new favorite thing
WAIT! I thought the whole Mr Beast Burger thing was a joke! 😂😂😂 idk it was a real thing
You cross the line
The model is here to stay, but not Mr. Beast specifically. The benefit here is the novelty. The celebrities will change as soon as they are no longer able to market the brand as well as someone new. But the kitchens will keep getting new tenants to fill their capacity and that is a good thing.
The sad thing is... no delivery service brings food out where I live :((((((
Now thats just a theory  A film  No a game  No  A food theory  Yeah thats right
Where I live most of the cool, popular restaurants that my favorite youtubers like have never been heard of here.
Southlake Texas? That’s where I live!! Gosh I should’ve gone there
I mean I knew that there wasn't actually was mr beast burger places but this gose in depth of it and thats what I like about game theory ,food theory, and film theory
"Mr. Beast Burger isn't what you think!"  So.... it's not something that sounds like an SNL sketch?
Early
I heard mr.beast wants to die with 0$ in his bank account
day 1 of asking for the bacon soup video
Hewo
I just wanted a burger...
money : *exists*  mr beast : ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK......then I will give it away to the less fortunate
The burger you just ate was not real
Fnaf is even creeping in on food theory
i havent watched the video yet so if i get this right im gonna be amazed but i think i already know what the video is about and if it is i  will be very dissapointed in you matpat
In n out has 361 not 342
A real life Fazbear's would be cool if they don't include those creepy animatronics
Dad or his YouTube channel made a response I guess to you Theory on film theory go check that out
Hi
Pls can Scott buy chuck e. cheese and make it fnaf themed..
Lol how are there 1.6 thousand comments only 20min after posting?
As a server with no line experience or experience in any other industry (I started in food industry at 16 and have been serving, bussing, bartending, etc for 8 years, but have never been a line cook) this sort of frightens me..... I'm just hoping that once this pandemic is finally over, concepts like this don't continue to be the norm.....
Thumbnail: Says Mr Beast Burger is not real. Me not knowing this was a thing: Uhh... what did I miss-
I just realised the intro changes each time
We want it in every place
If you want to try a live FNAF, look in Pasadena CA, there is a Freddy's Pizzaria where you can play a live version of FNAF with a 5 night's challenge, if it's still open because of the pandemic that is
If you could shut up and leave fnaf on game theory I’m already annoyed enough by how much you talk about it
Woooo matpat
Do a theory on #makiplierisntreal
2:30 300 plus he was willing to go even more hundreds in EU but couldn't due to legality issues
Only a Matter of time
Pizza Is Pizza - Sun Tzu, The Art Of War
So far I have watched every single episode of food theory
McDonalds is better.
scott, get in on this!!
Come on down to Butter Barn! 🥞 https://youtu.be/P6LaKJ7ekkg
I think he’s trying to help smaller companies gain customers and help them rise and get better and not die.                POG
Yes its vegistballs
Dude there's one in my city imma get it
@film theorists  I can see it now pat pizza
_notification squad has failed me_
Matpat should replace the mcdonalds from the intro with mrbeast burger change my mind
i liked Mr.Beast when he first started Jewtube, but now, hes just a sellout, "honey" "wickibuy" and now a fuckin burger joint, im done...
This is sad actually
The burgers are made of the people who lost challenges
There's 2 Mr beast burgers in town and they're both too far away to deliver to my place
Fun Fact: if someone kills Mr. Beast now than his vow of dying with 0$ in his bank account will be broken
l was like l hope that matpat make another food theory today.
I was curious to try the food but the ratings are so bad, I figured it wasn’t worth it. Probably hard to provide consistency across all locations with ghost kitchens. Same with Tyga’s chicken one
can you make a video about how pizza is greek
a smarter way to...?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Was I the only one who saw the things on twitter like “I got a nail in my burger”
i was waiting for this video for SOOOOO LONG
Lold at dtf
This is just the food version of netflix killing blockbuster. 2020 helped it. It killed eating inside restaurants but gave life to this. And it might be better in my opinion.
Honestly if there was anyone more deserving of a Nobel prize is should be Jimmy. Not only does he do so much for charity and homeless shelters or his trees initiative he is now keeping hard working chefs and caterers in paid work with this model. I wouldn't be surprised if there was something hidden in his small print that the burgers he sells pay for shelter meals etc.
People who live in the uk: ???
I had MrBeast burger yesterday, it was actually really really good
us: WE WANT AN UPDATE ON THE MARLIPLIER LORE  matpat: lets talk about mr beast's burger
Anyone else can’t get any Ubereats due to location being unavailable?
I honestly dislike the concept of mr. beast's channel and his target audience, his popularity isn't build on his personality or talent but that he gives money to people; i would feel greedy and stingy for subscribing to him tbh and his honey ads are so annoying btw
I jumped on and found 5 views with 1.4K likes and 8 dislikes. Just thought I'd say it since it'll change obviously
True
I know you're watching this video Jimmy
I hope this video wasn't a bad idea to post... don't want my favourite youtubers to beef.... get it ?**
Maybe Matpat *is* going to open a Freddy Fazbears pizzeria someday and if that happens, let's just hope nobody _purple_ is going to show up
The other day i noticed Mariah's cookies and mr.beasts burgers being in the same building and its a bertucci's Italian restaurant.
+Mr.Beast's burgers are going to put Matdonalds out of business.
You have manyt peoepl you in your orginizatosn/
Fancy food is a figment of your imagination
now i want italian food just from this video
0:15 plot twist: that was Matpat’s money
he changed the name of the channels 🤨
I thought you were going to say the burgers were made out of Broccoli or something
It's almost like turning a restaurant franchise into some sort of freelance business. Wow!
Exposing your friends be like
9:33 at least I'm doing better than him, I have 6 subs!
Speaking of food, how did that FOOD taste? You didn't eat any... right? right???
Hmm... That block-color, faceless clip art of a man at 10:27 looks familiar... I should tweet David Tennant and and ask him if he knows someone it looks like.
this was a fire vid bro
I haven't ordered a mrbeast burger because people say that it's not worth it
Who else got a door dash ad
this wasnt a theory this was just what he told us in the video
Mr Beast is gonna Comment in this Video!
Me and my 6 other friends ordered MrBeast burger from the location in Albany NY. We ordered about $85 worth of food, and only received half of it... not to mention it was really cold and dry. We called the restaurant and they told us to call someone else who never answered lmao
Unlike Film and Game theory, Food Theory Just talks about a fact, Mat Pat doesn't need to "Theorize" He just needs to research on a Topic.. That's the only reason Notifications aren't on on this Channel.
All of Matpat’s food theory episodes make me so hungry
is the cookie on mrbeast's menu the same as mariah's cookies ???
E
MrBeast is probably gonna comment something on this video
The only problem remains then is that the meals would be inconsistent depending on location. Whereas McDonalds and Wendy's get a big truck delivery of stuff from one location.
My local Chili's has opened a sister brand through DoorDash that just sells wings and curly fries
rad
Claim your ticket here until Mr. Beast comments 👇🏼
No
If there was a fnaf  themed restaurant I'd be going there every year for my b-day!
I feel like he makes more then 24 million yearly... I feel like he spends more then that LOL
Matpat gave the MrBeast wearing sunglasses picture some sunglasses MrBeast is now cool squared
You know what I want to work for this guy lol. And it is because he is so generous and I mean to his customers I love a customer friendly or loving franchise or business. I have worked for a few that make the claim that they are but for the most part they seem to be best case costumer neutral worst case and more often seeing people as wallets at least from my limited perspective (I don't claim to know everything lol) but what I am seeing here is just WOW
Had anyone seen a mr beast burger restaurant
but can someone tell me if the Mr. Beast burger actually tastes good?
no one is more invested in real life fazbear pizza than Matpat and i got to admire that, you'd think he'd never wanna see it in front of him after so many years of studying the lore, he either really loves the story or just developed stockholm syndrome
Say niggachu again
Mr.Beast the spoiled billionaire brat who wastes dollars for entertainment                   yay...
as a similiar concept. In turkey we have "yemeksepeti" which is an app/web-site that you can see restaurants near you and order online. It is pretty much like Steam but instead of games it is for food. And it is pretty much  rivalles. Of course you can also call the restaurant itself but the ability to see the available restaurants in your vicinity is pretty good. It has also integrated online payment options.  As a result of this a lot of restaurants in turkey can do delivery very easily. I feel like "yemeksepeti" is like ghostkitchen but they also outsource the menus itself.
“Giving away free money isn’t the best business model”  Says the guy who ruins kid’s childhood on Film Theory for a living
I like the video, but how is this a theory? This is just fact and could be uncovered by a simple googling of the companies and their locations.
Never heard of this guy. Neat though.
If their was a freddy fazbears gost kitchen,  i would love to see foxy running to diliver them!
But what’s up with DaD matpat?
Imagine Mr.Beast Commenting on this vid asking how the heck he comes up with this stuff
Plot twist the real beast burger tastes like paper
I love this challenge
I well not sure how to response to this video..... BUT I LOVE IT!!! Love ya MattyPatty
4:00 Finally! Cutout Amy! Been a long time coming, but it's good to have you here.
pov: you are looking for Mr.Beast
I kinda thought this was going to be a whole video about how Mr. Beast was screwing everybody over. It was a pleasant surprise.
In the words of Grandpa Joe " The mans a generous, he'll open millions of restaurants"
I almost forgot about mr beast burger
I live in Canada so I just sigh.
Cow
So if the brand of Mr.beast burger is being made by different ghost kitchens, would that mean that the quality and maybe the ingredients wouldn't be the same throughout?
HEY Mr. Beast can I have some cash?
bro not only has he given away millions, but he’s supporting smaller restaurant businesses through his chain i can’t

I have a book titled “Bravo!”
This is making me so hungry
I wanna try it but I’m outside of every delivery app’s range. Can only get local pizza through their own delivery services. Wish we could pick it up, one isn’t even too far from me!
Just Wings is a ghost kitchen operating out of Chili's. They are literally Chili's wings...
7:03 this guy has been here since day one i think he needs a name
What a genius
How did beast get so much money?
Every you tuber: *sells merch and sign ad deals* Mr Beast you opened his own chain of 300 ghost restaurants: pathetic.
Ye
Cheeseburger
I wait for the day he makes a gordon ramsey video 😌😌
nice
ive been getting a lot of Its Just Wings which is a ghost kitchen working out of chilis, for christmas my mom got me a chilis gift card... ill send her this link
These people are saving the restaurant industry.
You should make a channel called “YouTuber Theory” I don’t know why    but I think it would be a good idea.
Can't do this in canada :(
if you do make a fnaf ghost kitchen can you make shoure us in the UK can get access too? I love to see some freddy pizza
I’ve been seeing some sculptnation adds lately and I’ve been wondering, should I try their methods and are they right. And could they be used for a person with sensory issues because that limits a wide variety of healthy food because of taste, smell, texture, and even looks of the food.  Since you are the people I look for my theories, I would love to see a collaboration.
YoUR jUsT A mr beast hATER
I thought that a FNAF themed restaurant/escape room woulkd be a great business model
Your favorite thearest. I love all your channels
That intro was lit               By fire with money
6:46 I thought you made that up.
Coming Soon: THEORY BURGER!
ive not heard of this before, but this is genius. However that phrase "Ghost Kitchen" is not new, when delivery apps first launched, I recall there being news stories, and investigations, where it was reveled, that some bigger names were selling on the app, like the food was coming from their restaurant kitchen, but it was infact coming from a "ghost kitchen" sometimes a basic portacabin off site.There is obvious evolution of that idea here, but its still genius.
Mr beast burger is like a sponsor. The company gives you money, you add something to (what ever), and everyone is happy
Huh? Right!
Let’s not stay this way tho I’d like to dine in and not hav to worry about a stupid flu .
I am not that late ok
4:31 BIG BRAINS
You missed the opportunity to call Jimmy 'Mr.feast'  C'mon Matpat
Will that change the flavor of the food depending in which restaurant you buy it?
next video "food theory" is not what you think it is.
Yeah but can a buttersock actually take you out? I need answers.
Question, how many people already knew this?
Everyone gangsta until GlitchTrap invades a virtual resturant
his friends win most of the money
Me waiting for mr beast to Comment
Edit: can you get me to the most liked comment?
Hi 😃😄😁
Just gotta say as a Canadian it's weird to see the McDonald's logo without a maple leaf in the middle
soo every mrbeast burger is different for everyone?
Sup
Is there on in tn?

i never thought food theory would be so interesting

mr beas: throws money at some girls in his fast food girls: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Here befor mr beast comments
The theorist restaurant: instead of giving you food they give knowledge
A FNAF style ghost restraunt? That sounds like a great idea. When they deliver your food they have to put on a freddy head and jumpscare you lmaoooo.
That it just give money and be fam
If it says anything, my mom used to work at Buca di Beppo and almost everything was either frozen or moldy....
Free delivery today
Top 13 mins
matt "patt" "your" mom mr."beast" hmmmm now thats a interesting collab
I finally got a grilled cheese from Mr. beast burger, and some fries, and the grilled cheese was cold and burnt and the fries were half filled.
Yeah, I've been seeing more of the restaurants pop up and this really explains why. I've also been seeing a lot more restaurants following the Chuck E Chesse/Pasqually's thread. Restaurants like the Burger Den, which is just Dennys burgers, or The Wing Spot which is just Applebees or Chilis I believe. The food delivery game is truly revolutionizing the industry. Curious to see where we go from here.
Interesting
Is Matt going to start his own Ghost Kitchen Franchise?
Give money
i love all your videos :3
Crazy stuff ngl
like meh comment
It doesn't exist cos it's in Wyoming
Never before have I been jealous of America.
I was just watching mr. beast so this is insane
Therory: Why Being Vegetarian isnt as easy as you think
When he got to the part about ghost kitchens and how Mr Beast was paying other kitchens to make the food, I kinda realized that the whole reason Mr Beast might've started the whole thing in the first place was to make sure restaurant chefs were still getting paid since the pandemic is still keeping people from dining out at restaurants
i almost thought this video would be about something bad
10:35 hey, matpat, did you know that the same chuck-e-cheese that the kids died in is now being turned into a real life fnaf restaurant? I saw it on tiktok and it was a guy walking to the (now closed) haunted chuck-e-cheese restaurant and it had a poster on one of the doors that said that it was turning into a real fnaf restaurant! Please, see this!
Me just about to eat a burger from Mr. Beast and the nurse recommended to me It’s a sign
The beginning of the vid Already made me lose it XD
Dream SMP Dad MrBeast Burger What's next Markiplier not being real?
Welp, guess the corpos do win. This is just a cheap marketing ploy to keep business open that probably should have been closed already.

I have the 1330th comment
Matpat in the deserts section it says chocolate chip cookies so maybe all the celebrities don't own there own but they all own each others restaurant
Matpat videos are always so interesting and entertaining
now I can't wait to try mr beast burger
Fun Fact: Mr. beast actually did'nt come up with this idea originally, a youtuber from england named Niko Omilana did this, he did'nt make any locations to buy from, it was more limited edition but he did it first, jimmy just did it but over the top
but that is what i thought... duh he didn't build new locations or anything lol
Guess we know why Funtime Foxy's able to drive, he's gotta deliver all thise pizzas!
You know it’s just a burger a burger chain thanks for dinning
Wait, so does that mean the Travis Scott Burger can be an actual thing?
E

You know what stinks? There’s only 1 Mr. Beast store in Hawaii and there’s 8 ISLANDS  ( despite one being use for bombing practice).

Mr Beast: Opens 300 restaurants  McDonald’s: What’s your secret Mr Beast: We pay people to eat our food McDonald’s: Oh
Great video! I'll send this to a friend who owns a restaurant, and this could really help him out during this time.
Scott isn’t going to do it
HI

Wonder where Sister Location fell off for MatPat...
well that's something
SISTER LOCATION
The intro really got me
I want a Karl burger
Mrbeast is big brain
LIES
He said what a waste of money Mr beast burger does not cost money
At this point, Mat is just wanting a missing children case just even a city away from a restaurant so he can make a Food Theory and Game Theory crossover.
OoooooooFffffff
Mr Beast:   WTF

Hi dad
I tried the food Honestly it’s gross-
Im earlier then the fbi in the headquaters.
I live in WA so all I got to say about the pandemic is yeah them 2-3 weeks sucked.
MrBeast is low key a genius. Business Einstein but more discrete.
Notification Squad
What if MatPat started his own food chain. I don't know what it might be but I would buy it even if I didn't like it (Which I obviously would because MatPat)
This is nice but when is your conspiracy theory channel coming out?
What kind is restaurant is this?

Imagine just driving and then seeing a HUGE line
I'm pretty sure sister location is the sister brand in fnaf
My live is good again, at least till the video ends
*1206 comments in 8 minutes* Me: First
Mr beast burger
Theory: the Chinese did this on purpose the bat  soup was a coverup because China was trying to redirect focus not on them...but the rest of the world...the biggest mistake people make is assuming FOCAL IS CAUSAL...and that’s why they made up the bat soup story and released the virus. They did this so the rest of the world would look at them, but everyone else... you don’t think it’s a coincidence that chains is the most equipped for the virus? The lowest fatality...THEY CLOSED OFF AIR TRAVEL IN AUGEST OF 2019...if that’s not due ifk what is bro I talked to my friends dad and he said in august when he asked to fly in they said they had air traffic...that’s not a coincidence it can’t be. There’s no way and you know what else...they didn’t want anyone in or local people to fly out...they knew if people can in when worldwide travel was canceled the foreigners who came  in would have to stay...China DOESN’T want that!!! THEY WANT TI KEEP A LOW PROFILE...why did they make the bat soup coverup? They did that because they had to..they were desperate to redirect focus and that was a good coverup if you ask me...the rest of the world doesn’t care that much except the racist haters...they care about the millions of deaths this virus had caused...but heyyyy thsts JUST A THEORY...A CONSPIRACY THEORY AAAANNNNDDDD CUT 😎
Good video, but he pretty much said that himself...
POV: You haven't watched the video all through yet.
How many times did Mat say "Buca di Beppo"?????
Did you enjoy your FOOD can Matpat
Little did they know that mrbeasts burger is actually McDonald's
Chandler slider xtra pickles
This isn't a theory it's real life and cut
What’s your favorite book matpat?
Jesus died for you was buried and rose again on the third day according to the scriptures.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved. Please repent of your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.
oh wow that ghost restaurant idea is great! imagine, you dont have to close business, your employees still got a job and you get paid for it! thats amazing! many, MANY more restaurants need to do this to help their employees.
Remember when he opened a bank
Vr just got a new meaning
title kinda clickbait
Youtube is pokemon platinum
Don’t know about you guys but I knew this on day one.
mr beast manger says they have no ghost kitchens
Nlg I was 100% expecting a food theory on FOOD
Early may pat is G O D...
I ordered from the Mr Beast burger app, and when I got the food I was surprised to see a Foster’s Freeze bag 😂 (Karl’s inverted grilled cheese sandwich is SO GOOD)
Mr.Beast burger is not what you think it is  At this point is anything what we think it is

Now that's what I call a bold claim
The fact that I was watching Buzzfeed Unsolved before this and ghosts came up...
MatPat turned into a drama channel confirmed
Just stop okay you went to far just delete the video or the channel just stop
Ghost kitchen is the Ghost writers of Restaurant's
😱
Wait, it's all connected?!?!?!   Always has been....
Can you cover the kfc console next
Mmmmmm Mr.Beast Burger
This guy is funny maybe he should do a gaming theory channel

Mat just rebooted the MrBeast Burger controversy
That bravo restaurant is AMAZING their pizza is delicious
Uh oh
Mr beats isn't evil. Right?
Here before viral check
Hey matpat you might want to check up on markiplier
1
He needs to open his own virtual chain of fast food
Mr beast more like mr feast
The fact that he didn’t call it “mr feast” pisses me off
Yeah if y’all see tender shack on doordash it’s coming from the kitchen of an outback, it’s super annoying 😂 (I work at an outback in texas and no the workers do not get a cut the employees do not get anything from delivery apps)
I wish I could have a burger made with paper so the vegan people that hate money this is for your intro
We all know this video will get loads of views because matpat put Mr beast in the title 😂
➕ Fellowship invite
Mr. Beast is a really underrated youtuber, you should check his channel out guys!
We all know we are waiting for this theory
Nice napkins lol
4:30 idk why but the sunglasses on sunglasses irritate me lol
pls do a theory on minecraft orb of dominance.
MrBeast makes a pretty good burger  The banknotes are fried to perfection with a nice chipotle mayo dip

*Crys in Scottish*
Finally arrived within the first 10 mins!!
In a year MrBeast Burger will be going against McDonald’s
Another amazing video from food theory keep this up matpat :)
The intro burger is a real moneywaster. Was it tasty?
You know Jimmy is serious about him dying with 0 dollars if he wastes hundreds of thousands of dollars on a video he then cancels
This is the first episode that i realised that nugget from kindergarten jumps out of the pile of nuggets
I can only imagine Buca di Beppo.
Ngl I kinda wanna eat some Buca di beppo after this video
I didn't watch the video yet, but it sounds like a nice video:)
I early
*Obligatory restaurant*
Could say he's a beast...
Do you really have to get into math and history and stuff. Can you just get to the point
yep
Why dose mr hamburger have money inside it
the mr beast burger is legit so fucking good it's like five guys but not packed full of grease
Who else didn't even know that there was a such thing as a Mr. Beast Burger?
The only thing controversial about Beast Burger is the questionable food quality. Otherwise he’s just creating jobs
*mr beast be like*
I don’t know if there are any mr beat burger restaurants in Australia so I guess I’ll never get to try one
me: *sees the tittle* me its money laundering
Putting glasses on glasses
burger
mr beast is really beast
Is it just a front end for a few local franchises sold under Beasts Banner
This channel is literally kept me from going crazy thank u Matpat! ❤️❤️❤️
Hi
I was waiting for this theory
MatPat: "What a waste of money.." MrBeast: 👁💧👄💧👁
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ I need your opinion on this MatPat. Next video perhaps?
N-nani
Me clicks on the video think what is there to Theories about Mrbeast burgers
‎
Mr. Beast is such a cool guy. How could anyone dislike him?
Anyone else hum along to the food theory song at the start of the video? No? Just me?
Buca de Beppo is fun to say
Free restaurant? Shouldn’t it be in the negatives or something? I mean, it gives away money so the bill would be negative meaning the restaurant give you money which is what it does, it did. That means it should be the first “negative priced restaurant” or something along those lines?
2 minutes ago and im still not first 😔😔😔
when i first came to the video it had 5 views i reload my page and it has 26k views
k
MatPat, I love you but his name is Jimmy. Not Jim 😂

Mr beast burger probably gets more orders right than McDonald’s
Food Theory:  MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think... Me: Is MrBeast Burger  just another real estate company!🤣

“MrBeast Burger Is NOT What You Think” Was he giving away money?
4 MINUTES EARLY
Best channel ever
I was just watching adults watching game theory
Nice
974th
Yes
To quote the Lion King: "While others search for what they could take, a true king searches for what he could give."  Also, Buca di Beppo sounds like something VanossGaming would say.
I rushed to show my brother

The picture of the video: IT'S NOT REAL! Me:oh now you're gonna tell us these things like the "Markiplier isn't real"thing.
Maybe the burgers are made out of money? 🤔 💰
It’s just the Chuck E Cheese thing where they sell a different brand at restaurants already existing and do delivery only

QwQ omg I love your videos! And I did not know this wow...  Anyways can you do a theory about McDonald’s because people say THERE food is fake! And I Believe this because I hate McDonald’s I don’t like the taste of their food basically ( not trying to sound rude ) 😌😊😉😉🤗😱🥧🥫🍭🍔🥤🍟🍟🧅🥔🌮🥖🥮🥨🍦🧅🍬🍞🌰🍞🍎🥖🍇🍖🥭

To be fair Mr. Beast burger isn’t that great, I actually ordered it and was disappointed
I hope I never use money as napkins
Ok the king is at it again exposing big branded companies and also promoting them at the same time
LOL I was watching the vid when this game out
It's sorta a sham... but he's also helping out the local business
Can we just appreciate how every theory channel has an amazing intro.
Mr Beast did nothing wrong
Food theory
In before Mr Beast opens up Beast Space Force
On something
I love how the intro gag  is technically a joke about inflation
Looking forward for this
Ello every one. How many people remember when the first fnaf theory happened
About time you made a beast burger vid
Make a video about The Lamb Sauce
5 views!? But over 300 comments!? Yes YouTube, this is yes
Hi
Now this is brain food
guess what even if the comments aren’t loading if it says *455 comments* YOU’RE NOT FIRST
Oh it tastes terrible the paper taste I describe it as is terrible
So that's how you make a good restaurant
I've never been so fast lol
*MatPat Posts*  *Me: Clicks As Fast As Possible*  Off topic, but I also have a FNAF & Among Us Theory about the lore of the games. Idk why I put this here tho

Food theory: the burger is made out of grinded up contestants that lost previous challenges.

DAY 19 OF ASKING: PLEASE DO GAME LORE ON ONESHOT! I always wanted it after I saw Mark’s gameplay on it a few years ago! I have a few questions on it:  What is Taming? What is the deeper lore of the story? Are there more universes? Who is The Entity? Why does it not show Niko’s world at the Save Niko or Solstice ending? How does the Entity know about NPC’s? Does Niko live in a simulated world too?
nice
