Ah yes, before the rest of you realized that Elon Musk is crazy.
200mbps satellite Internet, holy smokes We live in the future
President musk didn't put the satellites in orbit, he paid people to and then took credit for it, same as literally everything else he sticks his name to.
This is one long ad
Thank you! Stay safe!
Treehouse looks awesome  Etienne
Dam space lasers
Did you travel back in time to go to that gas station? Very cool & retro
I just wanna thank you for your videos. I am not into camping at all but your videos literally therapy. Also that’s a great looking treehouse.
I got a speed test of 450mb/s 5g the other day
Love you Steve, but you are better then this. Stick to camping
Thank you buddy. Here, in Oregon. From South Carolina originally. Came out due to finding my dream. I am close. It is difficult and yet my dog, Ari, has saved my life. Otherwise, I am alone in this world for a reason. Safer for us. You give us courage to land in some of the places we land.  Many blessings. Thank you.
Yes Steve helps people more then you know and I'm glad he helped me and so many others got me back into my outdoor mode..same with me I've lived in car,camper,and tents and some with nothing lol.. learned a lot Steve keep it up brother cheers..
I'm always astonished when people seem to crave the taste of alcohol. I read some papers on tongue biochemistry and how genetics affects taste perception and it seems I will never be able to enjoy alcohol of any kind, ever. It may be an acquired taste, but it's not one that anyone can acquire. Since I drive twice the distance of a typical trucker most days, that's really quite good legally. I think 1000 miles is my record for one continuous journey.
In ways I love technology and in ways I hate it 😮
Scrolled for less than a minute and saw the term "game changer" 4 times. Paid comments, or bots?
Here from the mountains of Washington near the border of Canada, I have Starlink and is the only way I have internet where I am! Took me a long time to get this service, got to be on a waiting list usually..
Driving back roads is always a nice adventure!!
I have Starlink rv during the day it’s decent. 25-35 mbps but from 6pm-midnight it’s usually less than 1mobs because of being deprioritized
Thanks. Just saw this. Doing the RV camper life. Been thinking about starlink.
STARLINK IS BASICALLY ISDN  INTERNET SATELLITE DIAL UP NETWORK FROM THE 1980S
So.. Starlink just decided to rid themselves of their RV clientele.  Just this morning.. Starlink announced a $15 per month increase for RV users, that's $150 per month !! They also stated that current customers can return their equipment within 30 days for a full refund.. which is no doubt what I will be doing.  It was already pricey!  Pretty sure that they regret having created a segment for the traveler's, perhaps making it difficult to manage loads in urban areas?
it's amazing how one person like the great Steve Wallis, can keep me intrigued and watching when I will never get a starlink!
Why would one just not get the RV version and just use it wherever they are? at your home base, then take it camping, etc. etc. so that one just invested in one hunk of junk so to speak?
That is a real game changer for boondockers !!!
I just got it and tested it out. Works great not like home high speed service, but in places around the country that still have dial up and DSL, a great option.
You think I would be able to live stream video games and upload yourube videos without any lag on starlink?
CROSSROADS OF LIFE>>I found you today by looking up peeps who have experienced STARLINK.  I am a newcomer to your channel! I am a newcomer investigating the possibilities of RV life. Scared of this possible new adventure I will be taking, you bet as there is soo much to learn. Currently live in New England and rents have skyrocketed beyond repair!  I am seriously contemplating RV life, but sell online the last 20 years. This is my deciding factor, to whether I can continue to do sales online while RVING or not. What are your thoughts? Thank you for your time. Thank you for your amazing posts!
Just ordered mine!  Can't wait to see this review. (I did it backwards)
Starlink Ends Unlimited Data - Two Ways To Check Your Usage https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euHLzcvyGQM
Cost?
I thought you quit smoking?
Wonderful! The connection speeds your geting are far better then what I get at home currently.
that upload speed was honestly unexpected and impressive!
EyUp my friend, what wattage is your solar panel only been trying to get one, cheers my friend
Jeeez I’ve been waiting a year for Starlink to “come to my area”. Ugh.
Keep it up, love you
50mbps for sat internet, not bad at all! might have to invest in one
Funny when you say the big companies don't want to run cable into the rural areas.  What do you think people have been paying that "Universal Service Fund tax" for all these decades since Bill Clinton ?  It was supposed to fund RURAL areas internet infrastructure.  These companies like TWC, Insight, ATT, and the others are making a profit off that, they don't use it, and it's not going to the government!
Your camping download is higher than my satellite downloads at avg. 5mbs... Im getting the RV for my house.
Not for me no never.
That's so cool! I want one, but my measly gas station pay can't afford it haha!
Great Video! We Love our #starlink https://youtu.be/IB5azqBzTdo
Take care  bro..from Ontario Canada
unironically gets 4X the download/upload speed camping than I get at home. (In a city with a massive IT industry)
I always find it interesting you pay for petrol/fuel/gas upfront at a station in the US.
Love your videos fun to see where your stealth camping next!
Hi ! What power solar do you use ? It enough for Starlink? And also what inverter? May be you recommend something else for Starlink power .
48mbps is amazing.  I remember being happy with a 28.8k modem and thinking it was zippy.
watching all you videos, hope it helps
The light is underneath the router
I live in the woods in GA. 5g Internet is everywhere
Did you buy that jackery power bank separate or did starlink send?
I'm convinced that if everyone had a Steve Wallis in their life there would be no war
I've been playing with cell boosters in areas with spotty service. They seem to work pretty well as long as there's a signal to boost. A decent cell booster and antenna costs about as much as that Starlink setup, so maybe I've been going about it wrong.
Back in the 80's we has a disk that was HUGE (12ft Diameter) had a box in side the home that you could find a satalight.  then it all got trashed due to current land line internet DSL and whatever Greed was going on. this looks to be somewhat the same. At that time YOUR TAX MONEY PAD FOR IT (politics) back in the day, and now i don't even believe that system still works at all anymore.  So it takes 20 years for people to forget, then to reinvent the same shit. and i'll bet most do not even have a clue unless you are over 30 and payed taxe's.. back then we ALL paid that tax.
It's called weather modification aka chemtrails . Pretty cool gadget except for stealth camping because they can track that shit in a heartbeat.  Peace ✌️
Steve Starlink internet for Arrived thank you for showing me how it works
Dumb question. Is the “Satellite” yours to keep or is it rental?
Man this guy is loaded with cash lol
The Starlink service is coming to my area soon. Great to see a working use example. Thanks. I like the idea of taking it on the road.
The treehouse looks amazing, Steve. I'd love to see another episode in there sometime.
How long can you leave it paused? Is there a limit to letting it sit idle too long?
Excellent.  Now you can enjoy classic episodes of "Stealth Camping with Steve" (and upload new ones) at remote locations.  Cheers!
Does the satellite dish blow over/blow away in the wind?
This thing will be a game changer. People will be able to vanlife and live out in the middle of nowhere and be able to work and game and not give their arms and legs to live.
Where you did this test was it considered an active  area or a wait list area.
I just got it for my boat! Only $5k a month!
50 mb for camping is insane! My house with hugesdump is 2-3 mb and it is garbage...
How much is Starlink per month? I know they would have a startup fee or the cost of the product. How much is your setup? Thanks 🙏👍
I am so happy to see how much your channel has Grown and your  Subscriber base has tripled since I joined I'm very happy for you and let me tell you Steve you make a lot of people happy by doing what you do never be ashamed or feel like you have to explain a video that isn't camping or stealth camping
I've been wondering if people could somehow use electric hand cranks or somehow rig up a bicycle peddling crank and be able to recharge their portable power station that way when they can't get any sun to use the solar panels for it. I wonder if you could combine multiple electric hand cranks with more than one person cranking and together it would do the trick if it wouldn't do any good alone and takes too long or something to not even bother. I also wonder if there could be an evolution in electric hand cranks or something like that with new inventions that generate more energy power from them somehow. Would be great and then you could have internet all the time day and night everyday until something broke.
Thanks for taking us along with you, Steve….  😎
Bro great video I think you sold me on star link. I’m an off gridder with internet option
Lmao! “Unhealthy”🤣😂
yeah ..drowning the night skies with satillites ruining everything for astro photographers. Piss poor if you ask me.
Heard good things about starlink
I watch every one so good,all the way back from being
at 11:57 someone could lock you in and burn the treehouse
Look into onX hunt for property ownership.  The free version works fine for my needs
Gravel travel baby! Best thing ever!
I don’t even have LTE maybe 3G every now and then 😂
Everyone imagine being as silly as Steve to think this is a mediocre video. Enjoy the rest of your day.
£89/mo with a one-time hardware cost of £529  Bahaha haha haha bahaha ha nope
Price?! Why you no mention costs
Nice !
Great video Steve , would this work in my RV to use for fire sticks on the TVs?
Let me know when you come to alaska. Also I just ordered the rv dish kit
Hi, I want to say that you and all you podcasters claim you make videos every week!!   But that's not true!
So much for never doing a commercial episode!
Password should be, did you bring me beers?
I love that you drink that same ice coffee as me ahaha
is it waterproof?
I'm guessing you've recently watched The Big Lebowski? That's twice now you've mentioned something really tying the room together 😆
Hey Steve is there anyway I could send you some of my AKM merch?
Starlink is slowly ruining the night sky and I don't support it. 42,000 satellites polluting the night sky is far too many. Already us astronomers are seeing far too many satellite trails in our images. Help preserve the night sky.
Starlink was a game changer for me too!
Mask also gifted to Ukraine bless him ,thats how i"ve heard of it
Now others are uploading videos about Starlink I’m sure they stole the idea from Steve
I just commented on Van City van lives YouTube channel after Steve uploaded the Starlink video the only one I’ve ever seen Vancity Vanlife uploaded the exact same type of video about Starlink the very next day sad ppl copying the great Steve
The only motherfucker who camps and knows the difference between a dish and a phased array. What a guy!
Starbucks...  Just say NO.
Internet Surfing 🏄‍♂️ in the middle of NOWHERE , with Steve.  I hesitant to say that you were even camping.
id like to know where in canada this is at? love your work steve, keep it up good buddy!
Hey Steve, thanks for the video, you convinced me to get the Starlink RV setup, ? - what solar panel and battery pack are you using in the video?
3 259 US$/mo with a one-time hardware cost of 15 600 US$. are you kidding me wtf is this price
Thanks for showing actual watt draw using a jackery.  35-65 w is doable if you have even a small solar portable panel setup.  Great video
Your highest upload speed during your test is our highest download speed here and we're hardlined to high-speed internet through the phone lines, so yeah 50MBps DL (slow) is impressive. But $800 OT hardware and $150 a month... still too out of reach compared to the $5 rental hardware and $50 a month we pay for our service.
Hey Steve how is your crazy neighbor doing haven't seen him lately ,love the videos .
🙏
hello sir can i use Starlink Internet here in the Philippines?
Hi, great video! Would you happen to have more data regarding the power consumption of the new dish? I'm trying to figure out if I should get one but it's hard to get power consumption numbers...  Have a good day :)
LTE in my current position is stably hovering at 100KB/s. To put you in perspective, a 144p 18 minutes video with 26.4 MB video is now taking me full 5 minutes to finish downloading. 😅🤦🏻‍♂️ So, a 50 Mb/s download and 15 Mb/s upload would surely be mind blowing for me 😂😂😂
Hey Steve, what does a data plan for starlink retail for on a monthly basis?
Watching Steve film these in the middle of nowhere in Alberta... and I'm 10 minutes out of a decent sized town in Ontario and the best I can get is 6.68 up / 0.18 down on satellite available in my area...
Ty
Great info! How many watts on the solar panel?  Cheers!
So can someone buy this to use at their house and mount it on the roof instead of waiting  over a year for the residential star link?
I love you Steve have a great energy and I find peace watching your vids
The thing for running stuff out to rural areas is the governments talk big and "rah rah rah" it, but when it comes time to put up or shut up they just don't allocate the funding necessary to make it happen. Or the people who live in the area want the high speed internet, but they won't sign the easements necessary to secure routes out to those area.  Construction of power and communications lines are based on a payback over time model. In order the make DSL or Fiber make sense you have to have a certain density, or subsidize the construction so it pencils out for the company. Otherwise it's just a losing endeavor.
Months ago the News said the Starlink plan was to develop a Starlink Smartphone. As good as Apple or Android. That directly receives high up & download speeds to the phone without the dish. Or is that even possible?
Steve, do you have a link to the solar panel(s) used in this video?
Is it DC powered? Considering it's for an RV
This is great, thank you for sharing with us. Awesome sauce
There are no satellites. They're advanced balloons 👍
Camping on state owned land in Tennessee is now a felony.  Yee-Haw!
👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐👍👍
I’m going places my phone won’t work but it does off Wi-Fi thanks to starlink
Phone and internet don’t conflict with the theory of camping. They conflict with one theory of camping. There are many ways to camp. IMHO.
Here’s a question for you. I’m moving to a rural area east of California and they don’t have any Starlink systems available now. However I can’ get the star link RV model. Do you think this would suffice as a replacement for the original Starlink?
I have cable Xfinity and my download speed is 114 Mbps, but I upload speed is only 12 Mbps. So that great!
2 solar panels ? 1 is none ,2 is 1 ?or more ?
90% filler video. All I wanted to see was speeds and especially latency. Can't even see latency in the blurry video and you don't say what it is either, and you cut off the video before full speedtest could even complete on upload, both times. "I'm not going to do a bunch of speed tests"? Well that sucks, that's exactly what I wanted to see. I suggest a short <5 min video showing actual speeds and latency, with the numbers put up on the screen or at least say them.
I've had Starlink since January in the mountains of Northern California and just LOVE it!
Woah!!! My favorite stealth camper going high tech content!!!
$140  a month 😡
This will change the game for full time skoolie RV'ers. No more mobile hotspot and carrier bullshit. Technologies like this are bringing true off grid living ever closer to being an easily attainable reality rather than one with tons of drawbacks and compromises.
I quit my job to stealth camp
Great New Toy  😀 I'm going to have to look  Into that. 👍👍👍 M / M / M  Mt. Man Mike
Hey Steve, love your videos! Come to Gabriola Island some day, have a step two. Lots of places to stealth and a really nice provincial campground. Great foraging - in season - too!  Hunker down!
Boring
Steve im a newer viewer and I really like that you do what you love, enjoy the videos alot and I hope to be seeing more as we go on. Best of luck friend God bless
Power AND internet. Im running out of reasons to have a home...
Hey Steve, It is Julian from Julian Carty Studios! I just watched your livestream and I am so grateful for the shoutout! I am looking forward for my new upload stay tuned!
For the life of me I couldn’t figure out how to live mssg on your live stream.
Cool kit.
Unlimited data????
Wow, you must live pretty remote,  around here mechanic's and tow trucks every mile
Awesome
my hot spot operates on the 5 G network
Personally I hate starlink and what it is doing to astronomy, but happy it works well for you.
It isn't satellite, but I have a small box, smaller than a pack of cigarettes. It is a hot spot device. It is great, the one drawback is that it is dependent on cell towers.
Once this really takes off I could see it being very popular in rural areas that don't have high speed internet lines. There are still quite a few places in America with dialup internet.
try camping and sleeping next to a bee hive
your speeds in the middle of nowhere with Starlink are better than my speeds through Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable) in upstate NY. What the hell is wrong with this country...
boring as fuck
"People camp in many different ways"    Yes Steve! Amen!!!
Hey Steve, you can do live streaming every time you go camping. So we can camp with you real time.
Steve I just want to say when I go camping now my husband always asked where did you learn that camping with Steve? And the answer is normally yes. Thank you for doing this channel and putting something new out every week. I’ve been watching for almost two years now and have learned so much. So thank you for all the cool gadgets and amaze camping hacks, also thank you for being our YouTube bestie always enjoyed your one of a kind.
Now you could do some live streams from boondocking sites!
Those speeds are great for camping! If I did more with the RV, I would get one of those.
Could you set up a live stream at Everest base camp?  Thanks bro getter done
This new tech means hunkering down off grid indefinitely now becomes a reality.
Tent camping in polar bear country?  You mean assisted suicide?
Lol and beer is healthier
Thanks for the info on starlink .
good stuff steve. dont forget to stop and smell the roses!
My kid and I put a cell phone in hot spot mode between two plastic bowls and duct taped it to a really long tree and raised it to get Internet,  lol it was funny but innovative at the time.
You must make good money on YouTube To be able to afford all the things you’re doing including Sterling. I know I can’t afford Starlink at this point in time.  I wish.
200/20.......that is insane in my opinion. That will help with the uploads on the road for sure!!
I've been following you for awhile and learning. Dont have a tree house but a barn/small house. I help out people who need help. Camping Equipment is great way to fill it. And with your suggestion. Thank you.
This is a great service for those in rural areas/travelers who go into areas without service. In 2019 I took my new truck and travel trailer on a road trip from the west coast to the Florida keys up to Maine and back to the west coast, saw 44 states. During that trip I worked by driving to the nearest McDonald's or Starbucks every morning unless I was lucky enough to get cell service wherever I was camping and could then use my mobile hotspot (but man was it slow). Employees at McDonald's across the nation got to know me briefly before I disappeared again. I would stay in dispersed camping areas because they were free, but that also meant they were often a drive to get to. A lot of times I was driving 30-40 minutes in the morning to get to the nearest McDonald's and get my work done... and it's not exactly the most ideal environment to get work done with lots of people and kids running around. This Starlink system would have saved me a lot of trouble... although having to drive to the nearest McDonald's or Starbucks did force me to interact with locals more which was good for the purposes of the trip. Thinking about ordering this Starlink RV system but man it ain't the cheapest eh?
Almost 1million Steve
Imagine how helpful that would be in a warzone. Great to see it in Ukraine!
Just stumbled on your channel, I love it, it's fun and entertaining to watch. I did a lot of stealth camping alone the Appalachian trail but you take stealth camping to a whole new level. Keep it up.
Minute I saw the title I thought, “this is gonna be his most viewed video for sure”. Great video!!
Passenger trains and planes should make use of this new technology.
As usual love the vid.
Greatly informative video!  Thanks, Steve.
did't 40/49 of the satellites fall out of the sky earlier this year? not sure id trust it personally
Time for a Step Two!! Love what you do Steve!
this thing is literally better than my internet lol
Probably wise not to tent camp in polar bear country.  As they say regarding bears: If it's black, fight back. If it's brown, lay down. If it's white, say goodnight.
you are the best! hunker down and stay stealthy! 🍺🌲🌲🏕️🌲🌲
Those look cool, but I would prefer a phased plasma rifle in the 40 watt range.
"Tent camping on the beach in polar bear country" lmfao wtf
Thanks Steve. It looked good that Starlink thing.  :)
If you are getting away to relax why would you want internet
Very cool technology! Thanks for sharing.
The true supporters love the "mundane" videos just as much. Starlink is something I'll never have, so it's cool to learn about.
Watching the satellite move itself around was so cute, just like “hey lil buddy whatcha doin over there?”
When you're bad😅😅😅
I really wanna see you behind nothing in dugout shelter playing games on pc
This video cost me $700......ordered Starlink Internet for RV....looks MUCH better than our poor DSL.
Wow the tree house looks awesome
Good job! Take care of the house and we’ll see you soon!
Thanks for sharing the info about Starlink! How is the house going? Would love a walk through video when it’s done!! I bet it is amazing!! The tree house is Fancy Smancy now!! Great job!!
Thanks for this video, we've been looking at this and wondering about its actual speeds... Helpful!
Hey Steve! I know this isn't related to the content of this video but I just wanted to thank you for your unique channel. Your stealth roundabout camping video randomly popped up on my reccomended a few days ago and now I'm hooked! We need more creatives like you just doing what makes them happy. I'm about to start my vanlife and might even try my hand at some stealthing while I'm at it. Much love from Australia!
Love your videos
How are you getting on with the train tracks to the treehouse?
Thanks for the knowledge.
Steve you went from camping with the cheapest stuff you can find from Canadian tire to having starlink.... oh how fast you've grown.
Plan out your route to include the nessasary shops and parts stores for the bus. Love the Star Link !
Cheers bud!
Steve, how long has it taken you to perfect the craft of stealth opening a step two?  Asking for a friend.
I looked up on Mr Google Starlink in northern Canada 2023.   Yellowknife residents will be pleased or not as it ain’t cheap and the price won’t be going any lower.  💰
Seen a few star link videos but this is the first using solar and a battery 👍
Hey, Steve.  Just wondering if you'd maybe ever do another documentary style video of a road trip in the bus like your boondocking one.  I think itd be interesting after all this time to see what kind of stuff youd talk about thats on your mind now that wasnt then and maybe whats still on your mind now that was back then, anyways I love the channel.  Thank you
Been tethering my mobile, works pretty good for the most part.  Only down fall is relying on cell towers proximity.. But it's nice to be able to unplug once in a while.
Bunwich lol!
just think he's full of shit on the beer donations
so what he just said that he hates taking your money on a mediocre video... true Dat take their $ on a real video
welcome to high roller Steve with his shades...... $$$$$  fucks up everything
Steve this is an awesome video, you're shown a ton of people how star link works, but more important it will make it easier for you
Enter Live show
🇮🇪 ❤ Elon Musk could pay for the Bus to have the Starlink hooked up on top of the bus.#Elonmusk hook up the Hunkerdown bus?
Don't forget your microwave your big screen TV Your condition and  So on and so on..........brother please....
all hail lord Elon
Snack 😂😂😂 pulls out something that looks like the size of 5 donuts 🍩
hopefully God is there for you all when you call up
hey bro, don't put the light directly over the door of the tree house. Bugs. Put the light off near the far side so you still get light but not a swarm directly over your head as you go in and out.
Hi Steve! Every week I always look forward to your uploads! One of my favorite channels, much love from California. Cracking a step 2 just for you bud!
So I'm to believe they have internet in Ukraine but not Maryland.  Guess not only did they get free guns and 40 billion they got free internet.  FJB
Just so you know Steve, if you ever make an Xbox account I already took time4astep2 😂 and hunkerdown haha
STAR LINKS A SCAM LOST MINE IN FEDEX NO CUSTOMER SERVICE NO NUMBERS 0 WAY TO CONTACT THEM NO NOW IM OUT 700$
Hey Steve, I was checking out the Starlink website after the video and the availability map has Northern Canada going live Q1 2023.  Just an FYI
What's happening with your train track?
How much is your fuel? You paying almost £2 a liter?? I am!!
Tree house is looking awesome. I kind of want to build one now. Thanks for the star link info. I'm debating switching over so it's nice to hear from someone who has it.
Can you connect your cell to WIFI calling on Starlink and make calls in no cell service areas?
going to the arctic ocean sounds very metal, hell yeah.
Consider a bus trip to the US…
Loved the Mav palm at the end of the video.  Looking forward to summer with Steve, cheers!
China said - they may start shooting down StarLink satellites….
At my house in a rural area my internet is 20 download and like 8 upload. So this would be gladly welcomed. But I am in the waiting area.
Yayyy internet while camping! Sweeeet! Yes camping on that island would be cool!!!😁
Steve, just bring the polar bears a few bottles of Coca Cola! It works on the commercials?? Lol
Now you can put Steve  Wallis stealth  camping  on the sides  of the  car, with a small  try to find me underneath  the big sign,  and watch  the fun as they search for you from  your  hotel  room.  Just a dumb thought.  Joe  in Jacksonville
"Good stuff Man.. Enthralled in your vids 👍
.. imma So get this sh*t..📡🛰️🪐
Road trip, actual camping, or just hanging out... It's all Camping with Steve to me. ✌️
What make/model solar panel set is that? SUPER cool to see StarLink used like this. My wife and I want to be full time RV'ers in the next couple years and this will make remote work easy.
#46 on trends.. they grow up so fast 😢
Now you can do a live feed from BFE!
Cool, thanks man👍
I'm glad you have a way to upload from the field. I wouldn't worry about the spirit of camping as much, I think it would be cool to be able to chain camps together or go further out without having to sacrifice uploading. I'm a little worried about long term stability for Starlink just because of Elon. He sometimes seems more interested in being an internet celebrity than a CEO and keeps doing stuff like pawning Tesla to buy twitter so he can win an internet fight against 15 year olds. And he's overtly political with Starlink coverage and has all these countries thinking up ways to disable or destroy Starlink satellites specifically. I don't know what the future of internet access is or how we get rural communities more access, but I just think Starlink is going to end up being a stepping stone instead of the answer.  Man those gas station frappuccinos take me back. I lived on those things after my dad's liver transplant when he was having to get up at 5 am and be driven in for blood work all the time. I can taste this video. Funny the weird random things that connect with you sometimes.
Would like to see the raft with the wheels again.
Game changer. So many places where cell service is no where to be seen that this should work.
steve, I've been watching camping videos befores but seriously you got me to go on my first non stealth camping this weekend.  totally looking forward to it.
Just saying guys. Steve's vids are trending now?  Wow.   That's pretty cool.  But I'm also like damn. Hidden gem
Steve, you look really stressed. Please get your heart checked because you look like your suffering from hypertension which can lead to a heart attack. Take Care, David Matherson
Great video again Steve, you've inspired so many, my own channel included! making videos has helped me to get through a really tough time lately and i just want to say thank you for all you do!
Hey Steve can't wait until Thursday looking forward to seeing your next adventure!! Enjoy your content
Steve try Some Mukbang Videos.
Wow! Steve is on the trending page, that's cool!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_OlX7M5MLA     Lies in the Textbooks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN31FCcUlLk      The Dangers of Evolution
question I had is how do you brace it if it's windy? gotta strap it down somehow.
Making money now huh? I like how you pretend you don’t.
was once a big channel for me.............. not so much more
its not wierd to anyone else to make sure you connect to the friggin sky? wtf, yall arent just getting tv and good internet speed. your getting much much more
this maRks thevery END of stealth campming. even you know that. cmon  bro, your style? stalink internet? get fuking real bro!!
awesome video thanks
I actually seen the Starlink satellite in the night sky thought I was seeing things.
Always good to have a solid backup incase cell service is the shits. The Hunker Down Tree Bunker AKA Steve’s doghouse 😂😂
Man I have a fiber connection at my house that pulls down approximately 700mbps and uploads approximately 150mbps. My cell service is Verizon's sub-6 5G UW that pulls down 600mbps and uploads 80mbps. I can't imagine only getting 50 to 80 down and 20 up. That's crazy slow for me.
It's just incredible what beauty, what atmosphere you were able to create. This is truly a meditative experience watching you. I myself started making videos about my adventures, so I'm interested in everything. Grretings from Belarus tourist. ✌️
can i use the starlink rv for just at home?
That tree house is the bomb And can’t wait to see what the crazy neighbors tree house will look like he will probably have a hot tub and pool and helicopter landing .
I love that internet system. Loving the tree house also.
We love you Steve! Frank brown and Alice Undreland!
Love you Steve. Drinking one for you this video
🙂
That dish is a table. Good for a number of Step 2's.
How are you liking the rav4?
Steve you should get a Pontiac Aztec. Great camping car. I’m saying this wholeheartedly.
Nice to have options when in the sticks.  Go way north and it'll get harder to find sticks when you no longer have trees.
Impressive speeds, similar down to when I had cable, up blows away the cable!  I call it a win and I do consider it a breakthrough technology that someday I'll need, good to know it comes as a pay-as-you-go option.
Great video Steve!
Steve, that treehouse is fantastic! I remember when you made it out of garbage, and look where it is now! If that was on Airbnb I’d stay there for sure.
Lol stopped watching when the step 2 was a Frappuccino. Steve's lost his stealthy getting away with shit attitude 😒
The Gen2's are almost perfect.  Weather can mess with them but it's never to the point of complete signal loss.
hey @stevewallis love the new video. did you ever get your camera fixed that fell over on the island, or did you buy a new one? if so which one did you buy
Thanks Steve, this may be a game changer. I’m retired, wife computer works from home. Here in northern Maine, home to the largest forest east of the Mississippi. Unbelievable logging roads, lakes, islands, and tons of cool beautiful places to camp. Maybe now we can go more. Cheers!
Have Verizon wireless wifi , just plug in a six x six inch box and wait about 5 minutes to connect and we stream tv , down load YouTube videos and it's unlimited for 35 bucks a month.
Island camping with Steve 🇺🇸
The only problem with star link is that there planning to have so many satellites in the sky that soon we will not be able to see the stars past them.. kinda sad that my 2 year old might never see the stars like people have for eons. I just can’t get behind losing the stars to internet.
Reasons why I wouldn’t buy a bus for 1000.
I think a rug would really tie the room together Steve. Haha
I see you have a static caravan, when did you buy that? and can we have a tour?
I wish mine would come in. I applied for it back in early 2021/late 2020 and it’s still saying late 2022 for arrival for me
I like your videos
But you cant move every two weeks and expect you will have service. Nor can you go between countries
So cool
Wild that you can get better internet speed while out camping enjoying a great view while i get less then half those speeds from my house in the middle of a city
Cool coincidence, but Mav was just showing his "Starlink" too. Great minds think alike.
Hey Steve long time watcher. I was wondering what kind of camera you started using when you went to HD. Is it 4k?
Dude Arctic Ocean sweet. I'm kind of liking the idea of the bus now 😂
An Elon Musk product? Seriously Steve? Unsubscribing for supporting that trash.
Wondering what happened to the railroad that you were building we hadn't heard anything no you were busy at the house so what happened
oh man i'm pretty drunk on memorial day evening and i am loving a video on a starlink set up. I always forget how vacant it is up in that northwestern territory.. no, not in a bad way . It literally is GODS COUNTRY.
I like this starlink idea. Elon Musk is certaintly a smart dude.
Rock on
What a huge improvement in the tree house.  MUCH BETTER.
Hi Steve. Cool tree house 🏡. Speaking of the Arctic ocean have you watched Living the Van life?  He just did a trip up there from Washington state. Love your videos 👍
To be totally honest starlink is a pretty dang good way to get internet in the middle of nowhere. Can’t wait the to see the service progress in the future
Always outstanding AF  Thanks for Starlink info
Dang nice job on the tree house. Love to see some winter camping in that. Thanks for the info on the starlink I've been looking at those. Happy memorial day. 🇺🇸
💛💛💛
Radiation from those kills the earth. Elon must be stopped. Crimes against humanity.
Steve is getting better speeds on a satellite dish than what I get from a Spectrum hardline.....
Hi Steve, when is your stealth camp adventure coming? 😀 looking forward for that 😆
I live out of my van, and a solar panel, battery generator, and gaming laptop have meant the world to my headspace, recreation options, and ability to stay in touch. Not to mention a remote job I can do in the forest or on the lakefront.   I'll never get sick of the cool factor when I load up video games or movies in the wilderness for 30-130 watts.
Steve!  Just now watching the video, and it says it is #29 on Trending.  Seems like you're quite the popular guy.  Keep up the good work!
The treehouse is looking amazing!
Can we expect a live stream camping trip "Coming Soon"?
At Link to the Stars! "It's dangerous to go alone, take this." Nice setup.
You and I both love Starbucks frappacino,even though we know it has a cup of sugar in it.
Might be cheaper to become a diesel mechanic lol 😆
Steve Wallis phone home
Why would you use a product from Elon Musk? Im unsubscribing from your channel for supporting that degenerate. Bye Steve.
Figures some guy in CA has not one, but two while I literally have no internet available in remote Ca other than my cell phone. Just checked again, coming 2023. Roll eyes. Nothing against Steve intended, just frustrated at a 12 year old problem that nobody wants to solve.
Nice to see you Steve. Thank you for the update,I may look into that gizmo.
Great video looking forward to more adventures and some videos in your lovely tree house amazing place I would live in that tree house
Steve is TRENDING!
My $34 a month internet is slower than your portable starlink. 31.35 download and 5.35 upload. That works for me. I watch movies in HD and game with my buddies just fine. If it was mobile that would be amazing... that being said... SpaceX just made working while camping a real possibility. That is kind of amazing!!!
A smart man always builds his doghouse first.  Because you just never know.
3:17 that looks like a Squarial 😆
Nice update Steve! Keep on rockin
I think I’m more excited about the Arctic trip than anything else Steve’s done. I can’t wait for that!
This is exactly the sort of way I was hoping Starlink access would be used!
What's that battery / panel combo you're using?
Starlink is good but Telus offer a smarthub with up to a 100mbs plans and Starlink isn't reliable if there is too much traffic on the satellite its gonna boot you off
Have you considered a mobile wind turbine rather than or as well as solar? It might work better in Canada.
Looking to the future.  All the best Steve and always remember to follow your nose!🍁🦫
Just LS swap the bus.
Sweet always pays in many ways to think ahead when out of the track 👌🏼, talking of tracks I can't wait for the next update on the great Wallis western😂👍🏼 P. S anytime I see star link think of the star fox down meme
Internet camping is not camping..sry but that's 2 much like bn at home w cable n stuff.get back 2 real camping like in the boondocks.
Trust Gods the devil's to Starlink you and make you and your kids Du the dishes 👽👽👽👽👽👽📎🌍
just like stranger things haha
I'm happy for you that you got the Starlink but man I no longer support that company at all. They began with huge funding from pre-orders from people in the rural south in the US promising to bring internet to the hundreds of thousands of people with no internet whatsoever then proceeded to give literally everyone BUT us living in the rural south internet. After waiting 2 and a half years and watching as people who already had options for internet get Starlink while I still have nothing,  I cancelled my pre-order and won't ever be giving them a dime. Screw Elon and screw Starlink. I am happy for everyone else who gets it though. But screw Elon.
Still watch the 'mediocre' video anyway.. lol thanks Steve
Nice tracking device.
I would actuay prefer to take my home internet with me where ever i want.Wish Elon could just make a device that receives and reflects my signal so i could have internet everywhere without paying for something extra.I mean instead of paying 200€(for example) for this i could pay 200€ for the standard pack( wich includes my home only) and the other pack 300€( wich includes my home,mobile,or anything else).So you wont need any extra equipment.Just the sattelite.He could also have an app that shows you where the sattelite is and how good or bad the signal is in this area.No more extras!Just your home internet everywhere you want it!
Another massively subsidized Musk scheme..
lol my local isp only get maybe .5 upload and 10 download smh we only have 1 tower and its outdated by like 7 years T.T
Elon Musk. Nope. 😁
Why 1080p? What about 4K videos Steve?
We’ve been running Starlink down here in the 4 corners area of the states and have been blown away by the speeds!
Should try hunter biden's password.
I really liked the 'Thanks for stopping by for a visit today'. Made me feel as though it was all just aimed at me. Good feeling.
Thanks for showing the gear gives me ideas to get out there. Have fun 🤩
Could you tell us what the equipment costs? Just the Starlink part?
THANK YOU..                                                                                                            DES CREAN,,  BELFAST ,,  IRELAND
❤
Hunker Down! 🍻
Staying tuned Steve…… crazy neighbour must be busy today
Great demo Steve, the only thing missing is a mini Starlink robot to serve your Step 2 as you are setting up! 🙂
HUNKER DOWN STEVE! 🌲🌲🌲
Very interesting!
Your really losing focus steve !!
Very cool. I'll definitely look into getting this setup someday too
You can start live streaming live from camping with steve
I think Starlink looks great but latency as well as speeds are the important thing with internet.
interesting video Steve , it looks like a brilliant thing .
Great to see the Hunker Bunker 😆😆😆
Thank you, Im tired of people saying just get bell or rogers like we have that luxury in the country.
steve learn your self to be an handy man with those things its never to late to learn
Steve  actually eating a “little” 🥪
Stealth camp in a public library.
the rv speeds are almost triple mine :,) been seriously considering getting starlink
that tree house will come in so handy as summer is closer.... when wifey insists you have a delicious salad 🥗 you can storm off in huff and go to the tree house 🏡  (a hiding place for snacks and beer would help too) 😋
The rural areas are all terrifically underserved.  They strip away small towns viability for the future, they shut down clinics and pharmacices, and finally schools.  Yet - I don't know that many folks that dream of retiring to the roof of some inner city condo.  It's all "wide open spaces" that fills our dreams.
👍
Starlink for RV's. Toys for the rich. I struggle just to swing the gas prices. Maybe after I have a million subs, I can rub elbows with the money people.
I’ve been seeing a lot of videos lately featuring starlink.
Step 2 Password: Beer  (JK!!)
I camp to get away from the modern world … everythink about it as started sucking except my digital guitar amp and YouTube app 😂😂😂💪✌️peace mr hunker down
120down 😮😮😮
50down and 20up in the wild is nuts 👏👏👏
You're so close to 1M followers Steve!!!:)
nice
now that starlink is here gov is spending our money to run lines forthe companies  that never gave a fuck
i signed up for the beta test and didnt get it, i put a deposit down withing 10 seconds when it said it was available to in my area, amd here we are over a year later with no starlink.......
While I’ve enjoyed this video, I’m actually more interested in the Jackery and the solar panels than in the Starlink. Do you plan on putting out more videos on the solar thing?
Glad you got your new hook up. Looking forward to your new adventures.
Where I live, they actually put fiber optic put in the country. He'll my job has fiber optic, 10 miles out in the country but I don't an I live on the same street their fiberoptic office is on
Steve I love your videos because you keep it simple yet intriguing. Best of luck in your next adventures
Shout out Eastlink 🙌 lol not many Canadians know about Eastlink but nova Scotia and BC area 🤪
I'm stoked about this. I'm going to wait a bit  longer to see how it develops. Thanks for the info.
Hi this isn’t about road trips or anything but i am going camping with scouts this week Thursday-Sunday ( I am 12 ) and I am so exited I am in the uk though so It will be at night so any tips on staying warm with out heaters 😂 I love your vids bye
Awesome video. 👍 Hey Starlink doesn't connect to satellites. It connects to masts. You have hundreds of them in Canada. Some are as tall as 1500ft.
Almost at 1 million subs. Steve's the man. I watch these videos and they are so entertaining. Keep up the good work Steve from the UK 🇬🇧
Where are your old camper. Cant you do a rebuild on it  ?
I think the 'RV' part really just means portable, until they release 'on the go' connectivity; use while driving will void warranty, and I assume like Tesla they will have the ability to terminate usage if seen connected while driving??
I like the stealth camping videos. It teaches me survival tips in case I'm unemployed and can't afford to pay rent.
When Steve’s wife kicks him out of the house for being bad it’s not even a punishment, he can just hunker down in the treehouse and film.
Awesome video Steve! Thanks for sharing!!
I would have liked to see the speeds while you were moving in the vehicle. Anyone else?
Cool
Bears oh my.
My wife and I actually saw some of the satellites being launched while we were grilling at night. It was freaky looking and we thought it was some kind of UFO. Only to find out it was a chain of satellites.  We might try this service at some point because we don't have any internet service at the house.
I can’t wait for the eventual Arctic Ocean video! Until then I’ll keep watching every video before and after. Glad you got starlink and glad you’re getting the old homestead together!!
What’s your solar mat that you use
Dang! I've had my preorder in since November 2020. They still haven't shipped and still aren't "servicing our area"
Treehouse looks awesome, Steve!
On today's episode of Drinking with Steve. Steve stays sober. No step 2's Are you okay Steve??????????????????????????????????????????????????
That was very informative... for months I have been trying to figure out what we are going to do for internet access when we hit the road for good. My local broadband supplier told me to use my mobile phone... that definitely wouldn't have met our needs. So when I saw your video, I checked up to see if Starlink for RVs is available in the UK yet... it us, but a bit pricey: £114 per month ($144.09)!
Can I rent your treehouse?
Steeeeeve !!!!! Looking good my man . So happy for you and all your success, you deserve it all sir , have fun , be safe and enjoy the step two moments.
Nice!  I wonder if it could work on a boat on a calm day?
🇮🇹 🇨🇦 🍁 😁 👍
When I moved out last year I moved into a cabin in the woods, silly me didn’t think internet would be an issue because I was so close to so many people with the big companies. Sadly I could only get a crappy internet that was barely usable. I finally got Starlink two weeks ago and it’s leaps and bounds better. I work from home so it’s nice to actually get to work from home now
You rock Steve, love your videos as always
Thanks for the great Update, Steve!
I love this! Even an old lady like me could figure this out. It’s good to have the option of connecting to the world but really, you don’t have to.
I hooked my dad's starlink up a few months ago and I've been so curious about this! Thanks for the video!
So, just to be clear on the treehouse, it has a bar lock on both the inside and outside.    Can you get out if someone locks the outside?
I wish you would disclose where you are ie: name of the lake!
Great video Steve I was looking at one of these for my camper. It will be interesting to see how the billing works out, it looks like you can 'pause' it when not using it. But does that mean have to pay for a whole months usage or just the time you have used it each month? If you have to pay for a month at a time this could work out pricey for the odd weekend away.
This is NOT meant as a mean or rude comment Steve.   Just sayin..... please let me know when you get back to doing stealth camping vids.   God bless you bro!!!!!
Don't worry I'm step 2ing for you right now.
I was thinking that the price would come down but it has gone up. It is great for those outside Internet range like yourself but it will have to come down drastically to hit mainstream market. Great vlog, love the review.
It's awesome seeing you now have the option to watch stuff/even upload from the middle of nowhere :D  Sure it's fun to unplug when you're out in the wild, but I'd be lying if I said I've never watched your vids round a campfire haha Honestly some windy lonesome nights, the only thing that gets me sleeping is a bit of Youtube while I settle down to eat :)
“Mmmm … unhealthy” 😂
We live in the future
What is the latency (ping ms) like?
Rodger, Steve.
the cellphone LTE internet is a fad that needs to die. mine is unusable most of the time, I want starlink so bad but they keep pushing the availability dates back.
STEVE!!!! YOU ALMOST DID IT 1 MIL!!! I can’t believe it!!!!!!! CONGRATS BROTHER!!!!
That answers all of my questions about Starlink for RVs without listening to smarmy tech reviewers, plus I got to see your treehouse updated. How can you call that mediocre?
Any camping videos coming soon bud?  Lately it’s been sitting in the yard with Steve and installing internet with Steve.
Steve says . and I am not tent camping on a beach in polar bear country... 🤣 😂 lmao...there's limits.. bwaaahahahaha LMAO..love it!
You have been talking about Starlink for a long time and now I saw how it works. Happy for you on that. I do request more stealth camping. It is summertime and leaves on the trees and fine weather so please get Stealthy!
Steve... do you ever come across wild animals... I always have your videos on but I never see you too worried or see you come across anything...
We just got a mobile hotspot for our needs but we don't do anything except hook to the phones or watch TV. Just take it with camping and stuff. Personally I wouldn't put that light directly over the door. Bugs will get in your tree house! Dumbest thing they do w new RVs is put that light by the door.
That's pretty cool, I'm staying with my parents for a visit back home in a small QLD town, and their NBN internet is about spot on the speed you got on that test. Young me would have loved that speed back when we went camping a lot.. or any internet at all really, not a lot of mobile signal outside of town in this part of QLD
They say Internet is considered a core human right. I'm so happy for you, Steve 🏕
Whats sad is here in Australia i get 40 down in the house  .. this beats that
Love the video again that starlink looks awsome
House currently under constant repair Steve: let's live in the tree house Beautiful wife: umm camping is yur thing Steve's viewers: 😆 😆 hahahah
What was that solar panel you used with the jackery?
just found out i'm on autism spectrum a condition  most grow out of the worst of the symptoms  caused by   spoilers.....     poison [big umbrella corp bio tech, dried milk, shots, pesticides, sweeteners, artificials] or trauma [like being being exposed to violence or XXX sexual stuff, or being bombed, or terrorised by religion/hyperbole on the "news"] during childhood triggers the brain to begin to Mature [as a survival strategy, it means a loss of Innocence, growing-up-too-soon] large brain inside a child's skull = absolute chaos   human brain is so complex it takes 25 years to build one, humanity is magnificent, almost magical, mother nature's finest creation  most creatures around us are dead by age 25   shield your kids from poison & trauma until they are 25 = decent next generations = good decisions regarding future generations = survival of the species  ignore the angry people who want to "right the world" by killing their own species, they burn themselves up from the inside out and pass away early
OOh you could do a live stream on an island, really test the Starlink setup!?
It’s taken for granted here in Northern Finland you have very fast LTE, deep in the forest I can still get 160m download and around 80-100m upload depending on where you are. A 4K 30 min video to youtube takes 20mins usually. The transmitters are on high hills and focused on the road network.
Got my Steve fix. Aah, sweet release.
Hey Steve how do get in contact with starling I live in upstate NY and would like to try it out
Hey Steve how do get in contact with starling I live in upstate NY and would like to try it out
I have friends up in your neck of the woods and they are over the moon about Starlink. Now, if only it were widely available in parts of western Pennsylvania. We have the same urban-rural digital divide in some parts of my area--and we're only an hour away from Pittsburgh. Great video!
So basically the tree house is now an elevated cabin with storage underneath
I like how the birds have Canadian accents...eh!?
We are in the same boat. We are on their waiting list now.
This seems like a paid promotion?
Comment for the algorithm.
its really called LTE its an Antenna based system like always. Fact is 95% of any communication is made over optical undersea internet in every ocean their are loads of cables
The reason why Ukraine can communicate with the rest of the world and the reason why Russia threatened to murder him.
Elon musk is absolutely a genius, I’m so impressed…. Mars oh ya !
I never heard of Sturling How fast is your upload and download spread? Ok 200 dawn and 20 up ok 👍 11:45 tree 🌳 house 🏡 looks beautiful
Insulated, but the door on the otherside has large cracks in it :(
THANK YOU so much for doing this.   I heard mobile Starlink came out and of course it’s highly anticipated in #VanLife community.  It was very informative (and cool) to see what it’s like.   I really appreciate you doing this video.   TYTY
👍👍👍👍
hey Steve for the school bus, if it's diesel most truck stops have a diesel mechanic on duty and a repair shop.
Fresh buns = Happy Steve
Socialist Physics guy, Dr Nikola Tesla, who gave us our modern world, industrial revolution, his Tesla-coil is in everything, he had 700+ inventions, he wanted to give the kids (us) free Energy, he gave us wifi, wireless, microwave tech, vape tech, magnet tech, antigrav, hologram etc. We owe our iphones to Dr Nikola Tesla. Billionaire EM has done nothing for humanity, and never will.  Dr Nikola Tesla would have despised Capitalist Musk, he would never have put polluting "fossil" fuel on his coil, his machines would have all been clean, green, energy efficient, electric. You have to wonder why kids aren't taught about Dr Nikola Tesla, or Maxwell, or Field Theory, or Plato. [Universe is fields, magnetic fields, not particle-wave drivel.] Kids are only exposed to Capitalist Math guy Onestone [Einstein] who invented 0 cuz Maths isn't Physics or Science, it's bean counting, it's a tool.  Physics is the study of physical things.  Maths is quant-ifying, a quant-um is literally an unknown quant-ity, a quantum of solace is an unknown quant-ity of comfort. Say the word out loud slowly, quant......uhmmmm??? aka making it up as the go along.  Atomism is religion for atheists, they swap out god and replace it with a god particle, no one has ever seen either. One is conveniently "too big", the other is conveniently too small. Just as we must trust priests aren't lying about god. We must trust math guys aren't lying about god [particle].

Steve you can’t call the star link step 2 that’s place holder for drinking! You better call it step 3
Nice there is a internet connection for camping
Elon Musk is shady. Already you're faffing around in the woods with fake and gay electronics. Stick with what made us watch you. KISS.
Think about camping in canada and seeing "step 2" network in your phone 😂
Thank you, Steve. I’m probably moving to a rural area soon, and Internet access is definitely a concern. Good to know that Starlink is an acceptable option.
Very cool! I will tell you that I stealth camped just yesterday. I was really close to a trail but, since the only way to get where I ended up was to walk down the middle of the wash, no one bothered me even though I made a Dakota fire pit. Thanks for inspiring me to do this. I just lost a cat and I'm grieving so horribly that I needed to go sit in the outdoors. You don't know it maybe but your videos are giving lots of souls what they need and inspiring us to go out into the wild to even further fill our souls with the nature that we need so thank you.
Is anybody else worried that the treehouse lock is on the outside and who might get locked inside? Don’t make beautiful wife mad while you are filming a stealth out there 😉. I’m totally joking, but it could be a safety issue if some kids are ever hanging around there.
Got my square dish in March. Dropped my LTE internet as fast as I could speed literally increased by 100x. Speeds vary month to month as they add more satellites and then more users. As soon as Starship gets FAA approval they’ll launch the gen 2 sats which are 10x the capacity and speed and have laser links.  Currently the dish pings a sat at about 350 miles up, which pings back down to a ground station which then connects to the existing ground network and vice versa. So the bottleneck is both in the satellites, but mainly the ground station as it forces traffic through a few busy ground stations. Laser links, along with more ground stations and a few higher altitude shells to allow faster data transfer over greater distances, will allow your data to be routed around high congestion areas, and then downlinked through a less busy ground station.   You still might see speeds dropping if you’re in a big city, but most cities have established ground based infrastructure, so you’re better off with that anyway.   I expect Starlink to hit gigabit speeds in the next year or two, depending on when the stupid FAA grants launch approval at Starbase, and how successful the Starship/Superheavy test campaign is. Current plan is to launch the first batch of gen 2 Starlink sats with the first Starship orbital test. Which might mean they explode on the pad or somewhere between the pad and orbit, or they fail to deploy properly, etc. but still, I love the SpaceX is doing something useful with their test payload rather than just launching a chunk of concrete or a roll of steel.
Never get tired of your vlogs Steve. Camping or otherwise. How close are you to another river adventure.???
I love your videos Steve !
Starlink sucks.
yessireebob..camping in style.
Steve is my favorite youtuber and Canadian ever. You're living the life I wish I could! Stay badass Steve.
Almost 1 million
Even if you end up not using it, it is nice these kind of things exist.  I wonder why the starlink dish is always put on the ground, even on your permanent installation. I would have thought putting it on the roof would help clear the trees.
Impressed.  You know the difference of a parabolic dish and a phased array antenna!  Awesome.  *RESPECT*
That Starlink is amazing!
Steve you should go camp in that city that was too nice for you to camp in. That seems to be the ultimate test for a stealth camper, camping somewhere you're scared to get caught at.
Ordering mine soon in North Minnesota close to Canada.
Great, we can buy a Tesla in the UK but not this?
Steve. I just love watching you doing your thing. Thank you for sharing all of this with us. This is really special.
The difference between me and you is i “camp” all year long and stay unplugged. My version of camping is treating myself to a hotel room after a good harvest lol. Man the differences. People who live normal want to rough it. People who rough it want a shelter. So funny.
Hey Steve, talking about islands , have you done a stealth camp on Spirit Island, on Maline Lake in Jasper, or is that off limits to everyone?  Love your tree house.  And where is the cat you call Garbage?
Too freaking cool, movie time in the middle of nowhere !!!!!!! I was paying more for satellite in AZ, it sucked and was not mobile.
So fucking awesome you hooked yourself up with StarLink, staying up with the times bro 💙
Are you gonna mention its 100 plus us dollars per month. Its garbage.
Elon Musk ought to pay you handsomely for this video. It's got me more excited about starlink than any of their actual press material.
I just saw a video of mav who truck camps and apparently he has starlink on his truck. Pretty interesting considering i live off grid on the big island of Hawaii and cant get internet. No providers for my area besides satellite which is not worth it for crap speed. Rather go without for how much they charge for garbage service
I can imagine beautiful wife in an argument, “you’re sleeping on the sofa tonight!” and Steve thinking “the one in the treehouse, right?  Cool!”  in response, but best not to say it out loud…
It would be nice if they made it so you could power it direct from a solar panel without the Jackery.
This is so nice to see! We’re traveling quite a bit and this would be perfect, add service, cancel when done. And looks like 10x faster than any of the remote services I’ve ever seen (yes even in 2022). :)
Pleeeeaassseeeee! No more Musk! This dude has gone off the rails! I love you, though Steve!
Any plans on a trip to the States?
😮❗️✨👍
You're a real one, Steve.
Mav and Steve, to Starlink 🥂
Awesome 😎
It's camping season 🍺🍺✌️
STEVE as a long term subscriber l want to know did Starlink pay you for this, was this video just one long Add for starlink , l thought you were someone that did'nt sell out for corporate money
Starlink 😀 Starbuck 😔 !!
Hello Steve I've watched almost all of your videos I have yet to comment so here it goes. I appreciate your tireless efforts to filming and everything and your trips with crazy neighbor I watch small plots with Kevin and Sam bananas and they all refer to you quite a bit. Corporals corner told me to check you out but I was actually watching you before I was watching all these people.. I watch hours and hours of Bushcraft after 30 years the first part of June I may be going to the West part of Yellowstone in Wyoming going to fly up to Colorado and my friend and I are going to go up there and camp for about 4 days if it works out. Take care be safe your friend Arizona Dave
20gb up is insane to have anywhere you go!
STEVE WALLIS paid and sponsored by STARLINK, very dissapointed steve, l thought you dont commercialise products on your videos, this was just one long add for starlink  not a camping video
i suggest three of that (folded 4xpanel) setups ... while the one might work, 2 should be good for the satellite at any daytime area and a third should allow recharging everything to 80%-85% (suggested max recharge for lithium batteries )
was this video an add for starlink ? l was hoping for a stealth camping video not an add for an internet company, l have been watching your videos for two years and this is the first dislike l have given
man, crazy neighbor did some great work on that tree house
does more through solar at a random spot in canada than my greasy palmed state funded internet can do through cables for an absolutely ridiculous price here less than 20kms from a large european city for a ridiculous amount of money. and our newspapers here are insisting on calling elon a "twitter bully"  hmmm i wonder whyyyyyyyy?? why would that possible be hmmmmmmm
Musk is garbage. Free Market mumbo-jumbo is garbage. What can you expect from a country run on total garbage, exactly?
Get this man to a Million subscribers. Should have already had it.
Love the video, this is obviously the future of human interconnection and a great place to camp there, that island sure looks interesting!
Wen Livestream camping?
Great video as always, I can't wait to see how the rail road track is coming in future episodes. 😀
I hadn't thought about the potential towing problems of getting an RV or bus. That's kind of a pro for smaller vehicle camping.
residential is at the same price point now...
“Ahhh unhealthy” 😂 You are always hilarious Steve. Great video.
Can you post the link to your solar set up?
Steve watch living the van life he went up to artic ocean doing the winter and he had a splinter van
Oh lawd.. starbucks vanilla frap. I'm addicted to that crap.
I really wish you would t drive and operate a camera at the same time Steve, it's a recipe for disaster 👎🏻
Steve is living in the future.
the kw/hr usage is too high at the moment for portable use though, hopefully they can improve it even further in the future
My understanding, due to regulations it can only be used in the country of purchase.
That’s really good.
Is towing a small backup vehicle an option? Joe Robinet and others have Spot satellite SOS devices to summon help if they need it.
You have me sooooo very curious about these fresh buns in Canada 🙋🏾
I like the way you test the robustness of the kit by being quite rough with it rather than being girly-gentle with it. I also like how you first  try to set it up ‘freelance’ - and then, if all else fails, look at the instructions (or not) - real man!
👍👍
It only ruined the night sky.
Well you have no economical limits now within reason so might as well buy some useful stuff
I Don't see him replying to anyone.?..wonder why.
Just curious.do you work?.have a regular job?.or just do videos. I enjoy yur channel..from USA.
Still a great video Steve.
Don't apologize for fiddling around because your doing it for the viewers. There is a huge appetite for information about StarLInk and how well it's mobile platform  performs.
That’s where you’ll have to sleep when you’re a drunkard
Does it work in the rain?
So we don’t get it free like Ukraine?
Can’t you just take the regular on with u in the rv?
Thanks for sharing this great video with us, always nice to learn something new, 👍👍
"There's there's limits" lol right on
I love the fusion of tech and nature.
One of my goals one day is to just park a trailer on top of a mountain and spend a week up there working over sat or cell. I am somewhat sure I can make it happen. DUDE! I love the tree house!
That's one cool piece of tech. Bravo Elon!
Limitless data in my country with 4G/5G which covers most of the area here. I forget sometimes this may not be the case in many other places...
Wow.  It’s a real fucking tree house.
Would be too tempting to jump on the starlink bandwagon. Really. But there is a huge elephant in the room noone talks about...   Here in Europe you still need a DSL line for the telephone servicee, cause starlink won't connect to a standard providers voip service (and doesn't offer an own one)!!  That's a bummer, since especially in the rural areas there is often no cell service available - so good'ole telephone line is needed. Cheap, old, slow DSL copperline (ADSL, no vectoring...) does the trick. Unfortunately the internet speed on that infrastructure is emberrassing: 11mbit/s download and 512kbit/s upload.  So basically one needs both: old DSL for voip phone services and starlink for highspeed internet. Which adds up to about 150€/month. Plus power consumption of the dish due to its heating elements. The large dish draws about 80 watts, which is about 2kwh a day. With roughly 30cents/kwh we're talking about roughly 20€/month for the power consumption only. Then there is the dish itself, which is at 600€ at the moment. Say you spread that over 5 years or 60 month that's another 10€/month. So with dish investment distributed over 5 years, power consumption, starlink plan and DSL plan for telephone services we're at 180€/month, about can$ 245 a month!!! I don't see where a standard private household is willing to spend that amount of money for the extra internet speed (all costs for the static starlink service, not the more expensive new mobile one you tested in this video) If anyone sees a flaw in my thinking I'm happy to listen and discuss...
Satellites are not flying, they are orbiting... @ 1:42
We love ya Steve!!
My only real concern here is...did you shake up that frappucino well before you drank it 😦
Treehouse needs a 50-inch TV, so you and crazy neighbor can watch the Stanley Cup finals in a treehouse. Go solar!
On the tree house, why is the lock on the outside of the door?
Only a matter of time before that shill Ken Domik steals this content, and makes It his own to support his failing channel. Thank you Steve for not collabing with him.
Great video as usual Steve
Pricing from web site for US: $599 hardware cost and $135/mo.  A little higher than I thought...
Steve.... you are a STAR with that LINK 🤩👍🚌 Be happy and Hunker Down 😁
If I lived full time in an RV or van I would get one of these in a heartbeat.  And it's not that expensive once you factor in that you can probably stop your cell phone plan.  I mean, you will basically be carrying around high speed internet.  So, you could use something like magicjack, which is dirt cheap, to make your phone calls.  Your cell phone would still be good for emergency 911 calls since you don't need a service plan for that. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to keep setting it up.  Would have been nice if it was a box you just mounted on the roof... and the antenna would just pop up and acquire a satellite once you hit a button inside the RV.
Steve do you have a Motorbike? I think You would really Enjoy One!
lets see the island camp !!!!!
U might want to be bad  more often with that beautiful  tree house beautiful  wife might want to be bad with u lol !
Electricity in a tree house needs the explaining 😂 not the high speed internet out on the road 😆
I love having my phone camping because I can take pictures, identify plants and animals, check weather and see my gps location. I get a kick out of seeing myself in the middle of a lake when I'm in the canoe 😁 But I also don't use any social media or read the news or anything, so I get why people would leave it behind. That stuff's bad for you no matter where you are. I use it more like an actual computer, but tiny 💻😁
Star link is so cool!
Stealth Glamping!
Good luck Steve....
Was like 80% sure Crazy neighbor was going to be in the treehouse when you opened the door.
Stay safe out there my brother
Freeze your bottles of Frappuccino for a hour before enjoying. Shake well. Enjoy. Another great episode Steve
I would always have my phone with me, not just for myself, but in case I ever came across someone out in the wild who really needed medical or police assistance, you know?
Wow, that treehouse is looking sharp! Yeah, you can still see through that back door, but the inside looks really nice.
Thanks for the review, Steve! Awesome!
Coming soon! Camping With Steve Live! Cook and eat dinner WITH him! Watch him sleep! Wake up with him and watch him pack up camp all from the comfort of home!
Steve if you have the Starlink for an RV internet, why didn't you drive the bus & install it in the bus? I realize you want it also for camping in camp grounds or woods with your tent or etc.
How’s the train coming?
Nice spot Steve! You could have Beautiful Wife drop you off there with a kayak or boat and row over to the island for a stealth camp. :) Just a thought. Happy camping.
Even if you have to sleep out there when you’re bad, it’s not a bad spot lol.
No, you need to keep connected so you can feel safe.  You're almost always in bear country, polar or otherwise.  Tree house is looking amazing!
Infomercial.
those speeds i get in my home
Thx steve
Yay!
cool..thanks for the info
What kind of speed do you get with them. I've heard it's over $100 a month.
Cmon up bro .. welcome!
Starlink is literally everything I have ever dreamed of with internet. High speed internet legit wherever you are on planet Earth.
Well you just lost a follower... You're supporting the elites and their transhumanist agenda. You'll be one that gets his brain chip next. Peace.
if you buy star link and a satalite falls from the sky is it yours ?
yea way to go steve🤪😝🤩
Thanks for the update my friend.
We received our Starlink about a week ago, couldn't get the RV service because it was announced the day my dish arrived 😒 I did contact them about switching to the RV service they said I have to either return the equipment and buy another system or just buy another system? apparently once they set up a service type to the hardware they can't/won't allow changes to the account. they tried to tell me the equipment is different? you have the exact hardware I received: Dish, router, cables. and even the box. I believe the first part but not their equipment is different. what can you do? we just have to turn the roaming on and off as needed. at first I thought if you cancel service the equipment becomes E-Waste, this is only partially true because if you cancel service and can't get a address to reactivate it , well you have a $600.00 paperweight. also the rectangular dish doesn't have Ethernet ports you have to pay an extra $25 for an adapter, the cable is Propitiatory not as easy to run into a RV, I was hoping this would be the difference in the hardware, but it's the same ol rectangle dishy mc flat face
People who go camping and leave their phone at home! You're joking right, who are these 3 or 4 people?
Step 2's on quick road trips leads to step 8's heal to toe on the white line! "Officer in my defense how do I know you're not the one drunk and just think I'm walking sideways because you're too drunk to see straight, I'm gonna need to see your I.D and proof of insurance sir and if you could get your supervisor " works every time you wanna add a good laugh to your arrest and if you're in luck and the officer has video and audio recording it really speeds up the court situation!
There is no wrong way to camp.
Back in the day of dumb phones, it was never a surprise to wind up somewhere without service. And it often came as a relief as well, I loved feeling of being totally away from it all, one of the things we will soon never see again. We've got 5G all over everywhere, with 6G within the decade. Sad.
RE: The bus and being afraid of getting stranded, see if an eBike company would sponsor your channel to toss you a couple long-range bikes! Something with 90-120km range so you guys can just GPS pin where the bus is and ride back to cell service / recovery location
I love he tree house
Hey Steve…don’t put that light over the door,the bugs will be everywhere
Elon has permission to launch 12K satellites, but he wants 42K satellites in total. More space junk.
Cute little dish, Steve. I hope it works well!
I think a long live stream camp is due now that you got net haha great vid as always
Hey Steve! Tree house looks awesome. Stay safe! Cheers ❤️ 🍻
a rug would REALLY tie the room together ;)
Mediocre video. Not likely my friend. Thunder Bay.
Great video on Starlink there Steve.
This "Starlink" thing seems pretty dope. Whatever it takes to keep Steve and crew making my favorite YT videos. Love you guys, as always.
Stealth camping with Starlink is obv needed
Thats more money than I have
I like these updates, it's like taking a peak into a gear closet. It's just great to see someone talk about their interests in an entertaining way. Apart from the Starlink, you say some good stuff. I love the bit about enjoying camping however way you please. I feel like getting out in the wild in any way possible is good for anyone. Thanks Steve!
I have no idea what has made Steve think old diesel busses are hard to work on and nobody to work on them.. plenty of us down here in the states, what's wrong with Canada? figure it out.
Living in rural Indiana we don't have Starlink quite yet, but I am on the list for updates.  I'm lucky enough to have DSL...which gets me by for Netflix and internet, but upload speeds are horrible.  Takes me over an hour to upload a 10 minute YT video...lol.  An observation on the tree house...I'm concerned about the stairs, and the lack of supports under the boards if they're just screwed in.  Hate to see you fall through in a year or two.
Thanks for your effort Steve! I appreciate all the work you put into giving us a good,  by proxy experience...if you will. You are one of my few subscriptions and your authentic self is always looked forward to.
IRL Camping stream soon?
Oh for Christ sake can you be more transparent with getting your free Starlink so you can endorse it on you're YouTube channel? Come on bud how obvious is this . No more stealth camping or boondocking just being a sellout,  how sad bud how sad 😢 Say hello to Elon when you go to his house for scones and imported wine 🤨
Oh no Steve don't give your money to musky boy, that fraudster will hose you up one side and down the other. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised to discover the Starlink software speed test is purposely fudged by the initial download burst.
Hey Steve! What solar panels are you using? do they plug into your jackery without an adapter?
awesome 😀
Dang, that is pretty fast, I have to say it is better than our Cox communications cable internet speed . So I am going to check out starlink. Thanks Steve!
You need a rug for the treehouse to really tie the place together.
thats fucked up, u get better upload and download speeds on that than u get in australia in the capital fucking city
Why buy a bus u can't get any 1 to work on stupid pointless 😒
I'm curious Steve. Is step 2 "Came to believe that a higher power could restore me to sanity."?
Less of a tree house and more of a man cave?
LOL you didn't even charge the Jackery in advance of this. I love how half-assed you do some things Steve.
I pay $100/mo for comcast for 7 MB upload.. STEVE GETS MORE WHILE CAMPING
No matter what kind of video you make I always watch it is always interesting and I learn a lot thank you for sharing your life and travels
Very cool.
Lol Steve seems stressed out. Too much going on in his life.
I've been following Starlink since it was just an idea. Its come a long way in a short time but while right now its sold as a service for people who struggle to get Internet. I believe that's all going to change soon. Starlink 2 is ready which is something like a hundred times more powerful and SpaceX is about to come online itself with rockets so much bigger. It'll mean a massive shift in how much area Starlink can cover and more importantly for us living in more populated areas. It'll serve a lot more people. If I were a betting man I'd say this is the future of Internet for all of us and the speeds will only ever keep on increasing as the latencies reduce at lower costs no fat gouging ISP's can compete with. Its something I'd say you can buy into with confidence.
Good luck with your 🌟 link. Don't go to far from the link.
Wow! That’s so sci-fi-like! It finds the mother ship! 😮
greetings Steve big fan of you the top videos and stealth camping etc i will be traveling to the states from australia in august and am curious to know if your toyota has enough room for a person similar to your height and stature  to comfortably HUNKER DOWN in a pinch with the back seats folded down, keep up the great content reguards John  From Alpine projects
Welcome to Mr Wallis' neighborhood! :D
Steve, I’m really feeling you and Mav should have a meet up! 🤣. Just funny you both have starlink! And you both chatted about it. Treehouse looks amazing! Perfect place to hide and watch. Love camping with Steve!
Howdy Steve.  What is your Solar set up you used in this video?
weird...
"That's an acceptable camping download speed" *twice as fast as my internet in Arkansas and 6 times faster than it was 3 years ago*
I’m avoiding anything that comes from Musk. I just can’t stand the man. If he ever manages to build a city on Mars I’ll eat my own 💩 I don’t see how starlink a feasible as a long term business either
Nice!
Wow, modern technology!  What will Elon think of next?  I bet E.T. could phone home on that!!
Thanks Steve. I now know a lot more abbot Starlink. Good Day!
You're awesome man  Stay blessed
Nice starlink system Steve. Glad it will help with your channel and maybe some live streams from a stealth camp ? That would put things to the next level
Being a Boy means we love our toys!
How cool!
Have you considered spending some of your You Tube Money to make sure the bus is mechanically OK? Generally speaking that's what people do instead of thinking about the thing breaking down all the time. Get it?
Just saw that both you(1st) and Mav uploaded a star link related vid today.
Funny my step 2 was decaf coffee over ice cream.  Hey clouds make the best lighting because it's defused.  I hope this helps you go live  or more videos out in the wild
That download speed is considered pretty good for a cable here in Australia.
That treehouse has undergone quite a transformation!
Steve I find I love every video you you post!!Even if you think it's not interesting,I enjoy every  one and I watch them over and over.Your voice draws me in and you are so down to earth!! No acting ( just you)
Atta boy you shook it only twice at the gas pump 😂
Can’t wait for the bus trip!!
Just did a speed test of our home internet in Melbourne, Australia: 26.1 download, 0.76 upload.
Its amazing to me that they are giving rides to space yet they can not even give people good internet in all parts of the world.
Love the treehouse !
Hahaha! I was hoping for the monster "snack" sandwich. That aside, I'm glad to hear about Starlink on the road for you. That should be awesome.
I work for the US’ fastest growing fiber to the home internet provider and I live in an area with no hard wired internet access lol. Waiting for and anxiously anticipating my Starlink connection
I just use my phone hotspot nothing like the speeds you get lol
_f…ck Starlink and the NWO!_
_f…ck Starlink and the NWO!_
Hello from Belgium…we are not camping ,but we are spending plenty of time outside in Brugge. So glad we can watch you here!!!!
Hey Steve, not related to starlink, but what solar charger are you using, and would you recommend it? Looking for a portable option to keep electronics charged and car batteries (trolling motor batteries) charged. Yours looks like a good size, and pretty portable.
Those coffees are so good 👍
Say hello to beautiful wife and chin scratches to Garbage.💐
Damn you getting fancy!
very timely review.  Fedex shows mine shou[d be here in 3 days.  loiking forward to cancelling at least 1 of my 4 hot spot services where  1 is 5G while the others are 4G.
Everyone uploaded today so fresh
Just got mine today. I chose it because I live off grid and have no address. One thing that I did notice it looks like the modem/router may have a IP rating for water resistance. I would like to find this out but can’t find anything. I have mine setup right now between my house and the cabin so both places can use it. I have the router under a tote with rocks on it to keep it dry.
Same problem we had for years.  Dish or dial up.  A few years ago hub.  Than about a year ago a hub with a small antenna thing on the house.  We barely Got cause our home is on a hill but in a hole kinda with high rock and trees around.  So for $100 you 200 gb LTE and if you go over it’s unlimited for $200 I believe.  Which is high but decent for Canada.  Recently got my family on a family share plan we’re all different ages but we’re paying stupid prices.  So now I made such a shit storm we all get 50gb a month share plan. Unlimited calling to Canada/US etc.  For its was $45 but we only got 20gb each and expensiveive overages.  Now 50gb, us calling, cheap overages and 30gb more Internet for $60/65.  Which I’m happy with you have to be patient just put you phone and speaker while your doing what your doing what your doing and keep escalating if they’re not negotiating.    PS the hubs are free small and you can bring them anywhere.  You can also get and AT$T sim which has a US, Canada and Mexico plan for like $100 Canadian I believe you get a us number it’s basically just to get data is what I used it for 30gb I think. And unlimited for I can’t remember but they start to throttle you at around 100gb.  All the guys selling you special plans on kjiji are selling you plans you can get yourself but charging you $500 for something that costs $10 (SIM card) lol In canada rural get the hub not the basic expensive one the one with the small antenna.  PS had not starlink but the other provider so slow.  Have neighbours with the new systems better and more satellites.  Still slow and laggy.   You can stream in low quality and it will lag.  And it’s expensive.  Crazy I’m only 15 minutes from my town.  And the road I’m off of.  About 5 minutes from me gets fibre optics etc.  Winter there maybe 100 residents.  Summer thousands.  That’s the case 15 minutes + all around my town that’s why they came with better wireless.  12 k pop winter, couple hundred k in summer.  You think they would hanging cable, or whatever.  Most residents keep paying for there service even though they only use It for a couple months.  Canada’s wireless rates are insane, phone costs are stupid 2K cmon.  I was fine with the original iPhone with iPhone 7 interface.  My Job contractor/roofer.  I do well.  But I break a lot of phones.  2k every few  months NO!  And buying used people are asking for almost new for something they’ve used 4 years.  Cmon!  I’m lucky with my rates but the rates for new users yikes!
Are you sponsored by them?
Love you, love your show. Long time viewer . ('73) first time caller. Not wanting to join the Mancow militia but . I've been homeless other than marrige...
10:34 Thats me!!
Your explanation of StarLink is right on. I live in rural Maine where our local phone company refuses to run fiber optics, and there are no cable companies. The only option before was HughesNet which was so slow and unreliable. StarLink allows me to work from home so I’m a huge fan! It even runs at high speeds through  blizzards. The portable version seems very interesting. Thanks for your relaxing videos.
Hey Steve throught you would never go comercial  and  work for big man
Welcome to Advertising with Steve
Hoping starlink is better than other Sat internet providers. Used to instal them about 10-12 years ago and they were junk. Tech should have progressed a lot but no matter what you're going to run into the same issues as any satellite-dish based services.
Tent Camping On The Beach In Polar Bear Territory, come on Steve, the Inuit have been doing it for tens of thousands of years. Make it happen 🏔️🏔️🐻🐻⛺⛺
For what you do and more importantly for emergencies Starlink sounds awesome.  I do like to unplug when I go camping but I wouldn't mind having the option to call for help if I fall and break my leg in the middle of nowhere.
But....but.....but what about the Train !!??? Lol need an update
Strange top heavy router 😅
Can we see you do some gold prospecting while your out on a adventure? 🤠 would be awesome to see that while you hunker down
good deal, i think this thing will come in handy, thanks for sharing..
Good luck. The one my friend had incurred a problem with the modem suddenly saying it wasn't connected to the dish anymore and starlink refused to send a replacement
At least it's not called Skynet LOL
As an astrophotographer, I hate Starlink.  That is all. Keep on keepin' on Steve!
evolution of electronic technology.  one device will obsolete another. starlink satellite is 21st century and beyond.
Nice,  you got the Gen 2 dish, I got the Gen 1 dish, I seen you got Gen 1 for the house.  I made a cable to put in my house and got a female to female adapter hook the cables outside cause of the giant shield on the end of of the dish cables.
Great video Steve.
Great update video Steve! Keep us updated with how well starlink works over the time you use it, I've been curious
If you do decide to drive the Dempster Hwy up north, it's one of the most beautiful and brutal drives you can do in Canada. Bring spare tires!
Dig your content Steve, wish for longer videos!!!🍸
You do you Steve the faster you get the house worked out the more you get back to doing adventures!
That’s crazy mav just posted a video about starlink
Hey Steve,  good to see you back at the camp
I wish we didn't have to rely on Elon Husk for our digital infrastructure, but here we are. Hope it works out fer ya Steve ❗❗🍻🍻
Nothing wrong with a sober Sunday
OH come on Steve, do a camping vid in polar bear country in just an old regular tent!! Be like a found video footage, Blair Witch Style!!! You be famous, get movie made about you!! Giggle!!!
Shall be nice to have internet for camping indeed , looks like it is easy enough to set up for sure  thanks for taking us for a spin to show us the set up look forward to see how it pans out when camping crown
You have great videos Steve!! Outdoors McGee also has great vids
63k views in 4 hours??? Am I reading that right? Dang!!!
Hi Steve question you said the rv option is more with starlink. What is the price?  I'm on the waiting list and got an email about the rv option
None of your videos are mediocre, Steve. We just like hanging out with you. :)
The ultimate legend will pull off a stealth camp in Steve's tree-house without being noticed.  Who will accept the challenge?!
Are you coordinating with Mav? Because both of you released a Starlink video tonight.
Its fuckin STEVE TIME BITCHES
Hey Steve! I finished electrical engineering and did a project on 6G, 7G satellite communications, so this video answered many questions and who better to teach me about satellite internet than the adventurous Steve Wallis!
Put that in house.  It's to low on ground.  We get insane good internet with it in Oregon
For all the trash you pick up I’m surprised by you supporting starlink with all the space debris they have contributed to low orbit.
Did you even say thank you to Crazy neighbor for building that?If you did you didn't do it on camera.
Imagine crazy neighbor was passed out in the tree house when ya went in Steve!
We used to spend weekends at the local lake, playing Dungeons and Dragons by the campfire. Good days. ☺️
Steve none of your videos are mediocre! Very informative re Starlink .. need to look into it for our acreage
Starlink is the way to go for RVing or if you live in God’s country, 👍🏻 great vlog Steve
I'm gonna squat your treehouse
That's a nifty thing you got there Steve!
How much does it cost ?
Hey Steve, are those the jackery solar panels or another brand?
When I first subscribed to this channel, there were 41k subs. About a  month ago, seems like you had 840k subs. So now we are 920k! This summer, when you get  to ONE MILLION SUBSCRIBERS, I hope you will do an episode about your YT experience, and show off all your YT Awards, and your ONE MILLION Subscribers Trophy. You deserve it!
Woot ya payin at da racetrac fur fuel heh?   470 ish ere in MASSHOLE. 700 in the Commi Cali.  Before anyone screams at me, I love Steves videos. Love you all. jb     Daddy? Where do Dandelions come from?  Well Sally..They come from  Steve Wallis on youtube.   Now go slap your brother and dream of Trudeau.
Can’t wait to see some camping in Kentucky!!
Mr Advert
That starlink looks awesome Steve!!
For the first time, I am disappointed... that Steve did not include a beer donation list.
I am interested to see this demo of the starlink and also the solar panels. Its really awesome to see this in action. And, I think its a great idea to bring this along on camping trips.
Have you broken it to your wife yet that you will be living in the tree house this winter?
Hopefully not "camping up a STORM". Stay dry and safe.
if you need towing done, DRM recovery has rotators and wreckers that can get you out of any situation in Northern Alberta. (Based in edmonton)
"I'm seeing a tantalising island over there."   LOL! 😂😆🤣  I love it Steve. Keep the great videos coming.  God bless you Steve, your wife, and crazy neighbor, in Jesus Almighty name. ✝️🙏☦️
Well, it’s about time…it’s Sunday. When you miss posting a video on Thursday we cry. Keep on cooking!
I don't judge how people camp.  Get out there, enjoy yourself and nature.  Just cleanup after yourself.  If there is one thing I can't stand  is cleaning up after the last pig that was there before me.  I see Steve clean up after people in these videos every now and again.  Don't know how he keeps his cool about it.  When it happens to me, I'm always mumbling profanities.  Hoping the slobs left something with their full name or address so I can drive by and dump it on their lawn.  Hasn't happened yet.  Maybe one day.  A boy can dream.  Anyway, great vid.
Steve thanks for the belly laugh  I actually did LOL  Theres limits thats what got me. Have a awesome week steve and crew.
Got my Starlink in April. I love it. I live in a rural area with no service providers. Hunker down. Greetings from Nashville, Tennessee, USA
The moment when steve turns into marques brownlee. Seems so unreal but in a good way.
Love the treehouse.
Starlink seems pretty cool. I’d be interested in looking at it. Give an update on your mobile Starlink soon, please
your in my home town !!!
Thank you for another great video.  I love your dog house I meant Tree house.  Thank you again for taking us along.
Thanks for this video. I was looking at land that needed Starlink but I found a property that has cable already. But knowing that RV internet can be paused means I will need to order it as a backup internet option. I WFH so having a backup is a good idea. I plan to get a cellphone booster so mobile internet will be passable but I like the idea of having Starlink as a backup.  Any idea how Starlink works in an emergency? Like if my cable and mobile were out, should satellite still work?
Omg! I would love to see some polar bears!! That would be an awesome video!  Cheer!
It would be awesome to have a ceiling fan or window unit AC in the treehouse, for the hot summer months.
Your content has not been great as of late my man
I'm fine with someone wanting internet while camping, especially when they're making content for us to enjoy
Very cool - will really change camping.
1:20 Nice to see you can fill up better than Kenney.
I got regular starlink and it's great. I'm about to hit the road on some long trips and I'll be getting this one, the dish looks heaps smaller too.  I hope they release a 12v adapter so I don't have to run the inverter. 55w ain't too bad! I also hope it's all waterproof!
Wow! What a treehouse!
Hell yea
Great Steve.  I always enjoy your videos.  Is that a Harbor Freight solar panel setup?  Keep it up.
Your videos inspire me to wanna try this out. Keep up the awesome content.
This was a fascinating video. I have heard of Starlink but that's it. What a game changer. I'm looking forward to your trip to the Arctic Ocean! I'm glad the bus and Starlink are making it possible.
The big difference between starlink and previous satellite internet is the satellites themselves are much closer to you, in low earth orbit, and there are many many more. This greatly reduces latency (lag), and improves speed.
Hey Steve, at 1:20 how much was gasoline & how much did you get. $4.47 per in Ohio 5-29-22 8:57pm
Not a fan of full video advertising like this. I hope this isn’t something to look forward to.
Oh man thats a game changer!!! Now your camping!!!
When Steve says he's going to be camping up a storm, I half expect him to stealth camp on inside a police station or a Walmart...
i see a live stream camping episode in the near future
Don't fall for the Starlink scam, all you need is three quarters of an hour and you'll be saved from wasted time, effort, energy and money. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vuMzGhc1cg Watch this shit, fo real. Elon Musk is a fraud lol.
Maybe I missed it but does it actually work as you travel on the road?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vuMzGhc1cg Watch this, Steve. You've wasted your money. Elon Musk isn't intelligent, funny or anti-establishment. He's a China shill and a fraud.
How do you like the Allpowers solar panel? Which one do you have? Also, which Jackery model do you have? Been in the market them.
Commercials with Steve!!!!!!
Pretty low draw on the whole setup, which is nice. Doubly so if you're trying to run it all off solar like that!
"I'm gonna be camping up a storm here..."  Be careful what you wish for, Boss!
Story goes Steve was once furious and said, "Please, behave appropriately." ... Love your videos you're as calm as the campsites you visit.... Great relaxing to watch and undertake myself.... We love camping here in Thailand too... Cheers
Never heard the weird word acreage. Gunna need you to stop saying it. Thanks. Lol
Thank you for making this. The clip where you got gas touched my heart and brought my cat back to life.  You are the best youtubeer because you bring people's cats back to life.  peace and love
I just got my Flatty McFlatface here in California a couple of months ago, after waiting 2 years.  I'm miffed because the newest square one doesn't have any additional ports!  Glad it's working for you.  It's made a big difference here.
I'd enjoy a Starlink Speedtest from all locations in Canada that you end up visiting.
Why don't you just hotspot off your phone? It's free.
Steve Wallis live stream from a traffic circle. It could be epic.
that starlink system's gonna be perfect on the hunker bus with your more powerful solar array. at least, it ain't sitting on the ground for anyone to fumble around.😅
Did you ever get your 10 MM ?
That thing looks like an ET communicator. Steve, Phone home... 👽👽👽
Hey steve, you should get a little motor cycle, or bigger to mount on or to put in that bus incase you break down.
funny you mention gaming in the middle of no where. I like to go and just chill with a bluetooth in my ears with music and games on my phone. napping, drinking, hiking. bliss
Wow  !  That beats a Man Cave ,  an Man Tree Hutch.  Steve and Crazy Neighbor having Yoga classes and let's put in a Brass Pole for the ladies to exercise on.  Bar and Hot Tub,  too.  Oh yeah,  Crazy Steve starts his own Adult pod.  Blame it on the beer.  Yes,  but that Starlink to good use. Party like it 2030. Yipeee
Pop up some popcorn and watch Musk eat the cable and cell companies' lunch.
That is a great speed.  Edit: Thoughts on using steel wool and a 9 volt battery for a fire starter?
I have accompanied you many nights where I was stressed and needed to find a way to get relaxing sleep. Thanks for being you. You really are a great person and I feel like I have a friend I've never met. 🥰
good stuff.  thanks for the review
hunker down!
Nice live stream while camping!
Your "camping" internet is better than my home internet lol
👋
crazy! we have race tracs here in Florida.
LIVE STREAMS!?!?!?!
I could use one of those out here in the desert.  Back side of the mountains here you have nothing.
Please don't hang the light above the door you will have more bugs in side than outside.  Lol
52 mbs for download?wow this is insane men..52 mbs downloading so fast..and 16 mbs upload insane speed...honeslty i did not expect to be that fast.
Interesting video. Starlink would be great here in rural Australia.  How is the railway line getting along?
Does it include instructions in Ukrainian?
The weed hut
Thanks for the video, would have helped if you actually uploaded a video while on the Starlink out there, then we would see if it really works.
Thanks for the video, Steve! My fam here in the Philippines has been curious about Starlink for a while. Starlink was recently approved by our government which makes us excited. Seeing how it works and how the equipment is put together is very interesting! Some remote resorts can totally use that as a internet alternative. Hopefully the price for it won't change much here.
keep it up the tec of camping
Should have saved your money. Why pay for deception. Stick to the woods my friend . Nature doesn't lie !
What a tree house Steve you've done a brilliant job and crazy neighbour 👏👍👍
Elon Musk's Star Link is a game changer for me in a lot of ways.  I work in IT, and for remote offices in rural communities that have terrible rural ISP's (Looking at you Frontier and Quest), This is going to be a great failover path. secondly, it will also make a great network connection for out remote technicians, when they can't get internet or a cell signal. and finally, it will allow me to work remotely almost anywhere on earth once all the satellites are up. we are currently testing one of the units now at a very remote site. so far everything looks like it will do everything we need it to do.
Waste of money if you ask me but hey whatever works for you I guess 🤷‍♂️
I can smell the fresh wood!
Not mediocre, great stuff!!
Thank u for the upload I know ur busy
Snacking with Steve?
the gas station is on mink lake? nice
Starlink will get better when the sky is full of them.
Pretty impressive speed test for the new internet gizmo.  I think it more than justifies the price, especially with the awesome portability. The treehouse is also looking more and more like luxury camping.
No Steve......don’t know, don’t care. Just more spy technology .
Thanks Steve!
The most impressive thing here is him flexing on us by buying gas.
I thoroughly enjoyed this video! Starlink fascinates me. Great job as always
Awesomeness!!! Now we get greater access with steve's new s,ylink connectivity. The philippines just settled on okaying Skylink herectoo. But pricey! 500 USD for the gear ( 1 time fee) & 99.00 USD per month wow! 50.00 Ph peso to 1 USD. (Average need PhP 12,082 per month to meet their minimum living expenses ... I mention this only in passing that ) I wonder If Mr Musk ever considered sharpening his pencil for impoverished people? We love watching Camping with Steve here. Signed Philippine fans.
Great video very informative I got some great ideas thank you very much
Got that with a 60" screen. You're face is huge on the screen.
Just got mine today and ended my lease to move into a van on the same day. Couldn't have timed it better if I tried. It's not a perfect service but for areas without cell it'll work wonderfully for my needs.
You should do a camping trip with Elon Musk
Steve about to make contact with the ufo LOL
Steve I think it would be cool to do a value village /dollarama camping video, using only thrifted and dollar story stuff
Instal it at the school bus estevecamp!!
42k in 3 hours
👍😎🇨🇦
NONE of your videos are "mediocre", Steve, they're ALL fantastic!  Camping or not, I don't care, I just find you extremely interesting.  Thanks for the vid, stay safe!
live stealth camping stream?
🚨Everyone share Steve’s channel we only need 80k more ppl, share it everywhere let’s goooo 🚨
Steve, Ever heard of spot messenger?   Satellite based text messaging you can use anywhere   Great for just-incase.  No cell service required.    Handheld unit. service starts about $15 monthly.  Check into it.
I liked finding out more about starlink hope it's here soon
Have you thought of going to Great Slave Lake to camp?
Your awesome!!!!!!! Stay strong !!!!!
Great video Steve. Thanks for the info on Starlink. We have pretty good internet here in Victoria, Australia so i don't think we use it here. However a friend saw the satilites go over here last week.
But is it bear proof?
bear contry is crazy, but polar bear contry is a different level lol. thank goodness I live in Indiana 😂
When are you going to get out on the boat?
I like your attitude about camping! Anything that makes you happy and relaxed…that’s the main point of camping The tree house is now “Glamping”…..love it. 🇨🇦❤️
Very nice, I have starlink too and it was un-teathered (just after I got fiber)
I’m sorry but some of us are getting those speeds with cable internet. You should be happy. Just saying.
Welcome back
Sateloons. 🤣 everything is land based.
lets go
That stuff is faster than my comcast cable internet.
Infomercial for starlink  great content..
You have 1 million subscribers damn
Buy a better camper
Shouldn't this be mounted in your bus
pretty great that the Starlink works!.. I was worried you were going to break something o_O
You should look at getting a 'portable pedal powered generator' Steve mate. You sit on a chair and pedal to generate power. Be a good failsafe to power your Starlink.  They're about £200.  Love your videos mate.
Tree house looking AMAZING Crazy Neighbor!   You can basically RENT that TREE house out for $1,600 a month.
💡👍
You get faster speeds than my wired land line in the USA to comcast.  Starlink is amazing.  I might get it just to get away from Comast lol.
No worries, Steve, I'm responsibly enjoying a proper Step 2 while watching another great video!
I'm sure someone who got stranded while camping in 1912, would've loved Starlink or a cellphone. Technology is available to assist us. I've yet to see any "natural" camper, off-gridder or bushcrafter break out a stone axe or deer horn pick to set up shop. Nope, only the finest in tools. Use what's available and can help you.
I bet I can get Elon to post on your video. Watch and learn........ Cyberpunk will run flawlessly on this system.
You lost me when you bought the Starbucks coffee. I can’t support a company that constantly refuses to serve our police and military.
Welcome to WiFi testing with Steve in this video we test RV Starlink internet 😆. Love the Starlink internet idea not so sure on the price though .
Our family's idea of "camping" is a resort or a cruise.
Been on the Starlink Wait List for residential service for 15 months for central Pennsylvania. And someone who lives 4 miles away ordered it in Feb and just got his. There doesn't seem to be any logical sense as to who gets their order or when.  :(  Glad you have both. Now you and Crazy Neighbor can do LIVE videos from time to time.
Tree house is coming together amazing.
Steve, not familiar with the system but if behaves any thing like a regular access point, then more than likely it has faster WiFi standards that your iPhone(an older model) may not support. Would be curious to know the speeds with something like an iPhone 13.
I camp to get away from the internet.  Thanks for the video
Steve, you have a nice “audio book” voice 👍🏾
Starlink looks pretty good, looking forward to seeing the Artic Ocean and perhaps Polar Bears Camping trip, I don't blame you for not tenting on a beach with Polar bears or even Grizzly
Pretty cool Steve! Thanks for sharing ❤️
Gaming in the middle of nowhere is underrated specially when your playing horror games. Just me my laptop fresh late night air under the stars while playing video games.
You are a saint and a scholar..... Wow. No truer words.
sailing SV DELOS just gave away their portable solar panel/battery set-up : great episode  called "CROC HUNTERS of San Blas. SV Delos Ep 368"
Elon just tweeted let tomorrows sunshine be the best of or something like that. Sorry had a few beers today.
Wow your tree house looks even more incredible now! Love seeing the upgrades between each video. Hopefully its officially mosquito proof!
may your nights in the treehouse be more because you wish than because you've been "bad" 😂🤣
The treehouse is going to have power? I’ll have to update my Sims treehouse based on it to put it on the grid! (Yes, I also made a Sim Steve to go with it)
Light is on bottom lol, takes over 12hrs for it to find right satellite. You can use WiFi telephone with it in emergency to ring out. Have not been able to use wifi to receive calls yet though.
Where I have to sleep when I am bad.....😂😂😂😂
You should try to Livestream on that Island!!! My wife and I love the content!!!
Crazy Neighbor really did a great job on the treehouse!
Impressive speeds on the Star Link Steve!!! Looking forward to more remote camping videos.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 keep it up man love the content
Holy crap some tree house!! When I am bad it is under the deck for me and it is cramped lol.
no problem I have a step 2 every time you say step 2 very enjoyable we enjoy your show.
Getting closer to a million subscribers Steve! 🐻🍻
Hunker down!
Good video on testing Starlink and you could change of the channel to Hunker Down with Steve Wallis.
Give the wife to a friend and torch the acreage and start the bus!
Next should be a starlink cell services. Cell service anyway.
Thanks!
Thanks for the update at the end, you are always a few steps ahead.
sell the bus for a transit.
Acceptable camping speed... We'd be lucky to get that in Australia with our shitty (mostly copper) network 😂
Those speeds were way faster than I expected...
Starlink is a complete waste of money. You're paying quadruple for cellphone hotspot at dialup speeds
I was wondering if it worked through trees. looks like it's not supposed to...does it work at all though?
Mannnnn, starlink is available near me, having one I could take in my van would be so good, middle of nowhere internet.
Thank you Steve for the review.
Sorry Steve, google loom, balloons in the sky, lmao starlink
The tree house looks great!!
Psyched about that Arctic Ocean trip, although as a fellow bear-phobic (or 'sensibly bear-averse Canadian' as I like to say) the first place my mind went when you mentioned polar bears was to those flimsy-ass doors on the schoolbus. Polar bears are scary in a way even grizzlies aren't (and I'm terrified of grizzlies). Nice to see those spring-green central Albertan woods around the treehouse - and loved that gas station straight out of 1986. Hope everyone has a wonderful week. ❤️
We live in the future.
I'd never give Elon Madoff a dime.  And they've had internet for boats and RVs for years.....
Contact movie
“Aimlessly driving back roads.” You just described my weekends.
But I will not be getting it this what it would cost me here inn the uk At present Starlink has over 2,100 LEOs in orbit and their initial plan is to deploy a total of 4,425 by 2024. Customers in the UK currently pay from £89 per month (beware the future price rise – here), plus £50 for shipping and £529 for the kit (dish, router etc.)
Nothing wrong with watching some YouTube or tv when out on the trail. Especially in your down time. As long as you aren't compromising your safety whether that be battery life, or people hearing you.
Had no clue about the product you mentioned and I learned a lot. Thanks 😊 Steve. Love the insulated and almost finished tree house interior. It Da Bomb! You made my day! Thanks🌻
That upload looked capped.
You all are just gojng to have to tell us how Mars is
Love your videos. Looking forward to your next adventure.
Its pretty good.  Its better 'mb' than my home internet has.
it's so fun watching you and how you take things in stride. I have lived with frustration for so long now I take things as they come. sometimes not so understanding but not as uprooted as I once got.
Thank you for the video! ☺♥
You can't drink a single beer and go drive, in Canada?
Steve, what solar system are you using in this video?  Thinking of getting one myself. Thanks
thats so much faster than my own home internet....
You getting better speeds with that out in the middle of nowhere than iam here in the UK
What kind of solar panels are those?
almost seems like you have a phobia of bears did you have a traumatic experience?
When will you do a d.i.y. railway update?  Im so interested to see how it turns out, or did you give up on it?
Could you not compile a list of school bus mechanics for most of Canada before you set out?
Very interesting video Steve, thank you. Nice to see another aspect of camping that isn't really covered. That looked like a lovely area and look forward to you visiting that island lol Would  be great if there was a video on Thursday, as it would be great to finish .my birthday evening  watching you with all the guys here. Stay safe 🙂🙂
Your the best Steve!
Elon is obsessed with data surveillance. Starlink will probably rob you of internet privacy. All Tesla cars record data to build their roadmaps, its a data company hidden as a car company,  thats why stocks are so high. Starlink seems to make internet very cheap and easy bc the data they will collect is more valuable.
Thank you so much 🙏🏻 for showing the starlink ! We were wondering about it for RVing.
i've had Starlink for my home since last July... I absolutely love it...
There's a lock on the OUTSIDE of the door? Hmm lol.
Hey Steve - I've traveled for a couple weeks with my Starlink + Tesla Model Y & its been such a game changer. I did add a hitch pole holder for it when I'm camping so it's higher up & a bit more secure. I also love that now when in super remote areas you can still stay in touch via phone/FaceTime or call someone in an emergency. The one thing I plan to use it for besides uploading YouTube videos and streaming movies at night, is to Livestream from beautiful remote locations. That's something I think we'd all love to see you do as well. I've been consistently getting speeds of 125 Mbps down & 20 up. As for the lights... Funny enough they don't come on. Kept waiting for that myself, but then found they don't actually illuminate. Keep up the great work! 😀
Yeah and can't wait to see The Hunker Down Express all aboard
Nice unit!!! .And Starlink looks good too 😂 🍻
There you are, Steve! Had me thinking a bear got a hold of you.
Awesome update Steve!! Nice hardware to assist in your upload capabilities brother!! Cheers Camping with Steve Fam 👊🏼😎🤙🏼
To expensive
Tree house looks awesome
Is he using a iPhone 8? 😂
Really cool device
My Spectrum speed test at home (Upstate, NY) - download speed 192.94 (not normal, its usually around 80mbps), upload speed 11.64. I had to test my speed when I saw your upload speed because I knew mine never gets over 13 mbps in my house on a private network. Thanks Steve!
Currently watching your video via Starlink.
I see you copied showing yourself grabbing things off of the shelf from Mav. lol
Woot woot. How's the train coming along? Treehouse is about ready for Airbnb 🤩👍❣️
Hey son, check out what Steve got! I already saw that one dad.   But he just posted this like an hour ago! Yeah dad, I’ve got notifications turned on.  😑
Awesome Steve was excited when your new video popped up on notification, but anyway love watching you an ready to see your trip gonna be good, thanks brother.
Hunkered down on the couch watching Steve  this is the life the 🎄 🏠 looks awesome like what you said  a place to go when you become bad Steve  hope you and the family and garbage 🐈 have a good week and Crazy Neighbor see you Thursday if all goes well Cheers 🥂
Hi Steve!  You call it a mediocre video bit I'm grateful for the upload and insight into the starlink.  Look forward to your next one bud!  See ya!
Somebody was just recently talking about blowing Starlink out of orbit, that’s Elon Musk sci fi stuff, espionage and all that stuff movies are made from.  So if you go black that might be why.
ah ha glamping and you are right we all do it different Cheers.
How much does this starlink set up cost to buy and what is the monthly charge when u use it
Thanks, Steve!
Those Starbuck coffees are the best!!!!! That sucks that the internet out there sucks!
I like how Steve just casually grabs the pieces of the Starlink system out of the box and sets them up with little technical discussion and it just works. Sure, this is tech glamping but as long as you're honest about it, it's fine. Only active duty Navy Seals are required to be tired, cold and hungry all the time.
Hold onto your tits LTT! There's a new Tech guy in Canada!
This is an outstanding result considering that the Starlink Network is maybe 30% complete.  It will only get stronger.
Foot likes aimlessly driving back roads all day long.
You can live stream in HD quality now.
Steve please get your inflatable yak and paddle out to that island and camp overnight
Thank You, good time.  Tree house is cool. Looking forward to more.
The star link runs off of cell towers not  satellite take it to places where there are no cell towers and see if it work, there are no satellites it's a big lie.
Sweet new tech upgrade Steve.
Hi steve.  I bought starlink.  I have porn vids addiction.  I need to watch porno everyday.  It makes me feel good
This is very reassuring for cottage "camping".  The speeds are very acceptable, so the wife can still watch her IPTV
Steve should release a "Hunker Down" Mans supportive chest garment in his Online Store! He could start wearing it on the channel too..
Love my starlink. I travel alone and like the security blanket of contacting civilization when I’m off the beaten path. No lights on the front of the new router, just a design.
Hey Steve. I know it's only May... but I remember one of my favorite video you made was the one where you cooled your tent with a air conditioner... Do you think it's possible to heat up a tent with an electric block heater(s) in Canadian prairies winter?
Steve, that's better than my home wired speed!?  I expected something dire and was shocked when it went so high. :D
Dang all my favorite camping channels are starting to get boring
DRINK A BEER STEVE 🍺
Okay, that 1st test you did was the best speed we can get for broadband on download and upload. Then you did the update, OMG, that is speed what I dream of! Great investment and love the vids as always no matter what content/subject they are, thank you :)
unhealthy but so good.
HI Steve. Man that tree house is looking great. Looking forward to the next video.
Jeez. My fibre optic here in Australia tops off at around 40mbps. Wtf
Nice video, Steve. I’ve been camping out in my backyard, for the last two nights. I got a ton of dead wood from the neighbors apple tree. I’ve had a constant fire for two days. I just bought a 53 gallon, Extreme Tough, outdoor container, made by Contico. I have my camping equipment in it, it has a lock, nice. I cut treated 4 x 4 treated lumber, for underneath it. Weed is live now. You are the man.👍🏻 I’ve watched all you adventures. Now I’m doing it in my large backyard. ☮️
Counting down to 1 million!!!
Wow!  What a tree house!
Does it cost a lot for the service?
There is one problem with starlink, they were cheap on the sunscreen so every solar flare wipes half of them out PS: It s more a bathtub than a dish( For using in a z0mbie apocalypse  :-)
Hey Steve, just a couple of things, on the new Starlink router, there is a power light but its on the underside where the dish and power plug are.  Also from what I've heard there is currently a northern latitude limit, but I'm not 100% sure what it is at the moment.  I know they've launched polar orbit satellites for more northern/southern coverage, but it might not cover Yukon, Northwest Territories or Nunavut yet.
frenchy Dave here ! So when can I move into the treehouse  . Don't worry about feeding me because I only eat swamp critters
omgomg I find it cool how you can uplink to a Starlink subscription in random camping spots around the random Canadian forest. I love that for you Steve lol!
I'm curious how Starlink performs over a few months
i'll be honest with ya Steve, the tree house seems like a great place to run the office as well!!
Not becoming bear poop runs pretty high on the priority list, for self aware campers.
Hey Steve! Avid Starlink user and modder here- Depending on your use-case for your Starlink, I'd go pick up one of the shortest cables they sell. The power losses on their longer cables are quite wasteful for those of us on solar or batteries!
Did you pay for this yourself or was it provided free of charge? This info is very important. Any honest youtuber would provide this info upfront.
New viewer love then content.
The direction of the antenna probably has more to do with closest ground station. The satellites are in orbit and constantly changing position. The initial starlink satelites rely on ground stations within about 500 miles of your location so your antenna is likely to point in that direction so the satellites you communicate with have the lowest latency.
This is that time of year that Brite green blinds in tell it gets more drab in the leaves so it's going to be fun. 😎
Meh!!! I expected more..😂🤣😂
Hey bud, thanks so much for sharing the Starlink! My wife an I have lived the RV life for almost five years an love it. I've ordered a starlink so thanks so much for sharing your valuable information!! Much love from Maine,USA
Would love to see steve brew his own step 2. Legally of course.
..  Cheers to you  ..
Awesome Starlink demo Steve, thank you Sir...
All your videos Steve are entertaining stealth or not.
Thanks for this. My husband and I are full-time RVers and are waiting for this to become available in our area.
Well as far as I know your RV antenna is pulling half power as my OG antenna. Can't complain there, you got wifi calling in the middle of nowhere.
Dig the video, but it would be cool if you could make running a low-pass filter part of your video work flow (I don't edit videos but I think this is a thing). Might be just me, but my subwoofer just LOVES that rumbling wind and other low notes, but myself and my cat do not. It doesn't add anything to the video (IMO) and I won't avoid your channel over it, but I think many may appreciate it if you can't do a wind muff. ❤️
To fix that. Just create ports around the house and link them. So if you need to move it around the house, you always have a spot to connect it. Not sure if starlink is coaxial or fiber
lol. must be nice to actually get your starlink after you pay for it😂 guess I'm a few thousand subscribers short of getting my first one but steve and all the other youtubers can get all of them they need faster and with no problem... that's what i get for making my "first come, first serve" deposit in the first hour possible i suppose.
Welcome to Steve Techtips haha.
You are the physical form of when someone says to “just be yourself “
steve can you upload your videos in 4k again please as the quality is better. i have 1080p monito and still its looking a bit degraded. thanks
You can cancel your service at the end of the month?... doesn't sound different than a lot of providers.  Is the home version of starlink not cancelable?
Man, I’m jealous. I won’t be getting my starling for my house, untill 2023.
Your tree house would make a great hunting blind
I can smell the inside of that gas station
On step two now, in Missouri, with high speed Verizon cell service. I can see the 4G tower from my back deck. Starlink is waitlisted over most of the state. We have a lot of dead cellular service areas around here so We are lucky living in our rural area. The fiber optic option will never get here so we gave up television and either garden, brew step two, or go backpacking.
Not my favorite video by you. Sorry.
Thank you Steve. I'm 70 in Huber Heights, OH, and was having a bad day because of things going on in my life.  Your videos really help me.
How many watts does it pull Steve?
The tree house looks Great! I'm looking into getting a Star Link for my home. It's extremely difficult to get any company to come to a Mountain Property in the middle of nowhere... So thanks for showing the testing. I'll probably be to mine way up on top... We will see!
Always excited to see what's next
That was cool. I did not know what starlink even was. Definitely something the van life people need.
Hello from British Columbia Canada  🇨🇦👋👍♥️🌲🚵‍♀️🌲🧘‍♀️🎨🖌👍📚😎
I would love steve take the starlight on his tire boat..
Thanks Steve !  Excellent information By the way, I loved the rafting adventures.
So you can go to a remote area and order pizza??  Can bears operate it ??
hello flower am interested xx
It’s a good day when Steve uploads
elon MusK is  MAJOR REASON uKRAIN CAN DEFEND ITSELF SO WELL.
Tree fort looks great.
Where you have to sleep when you're bad?  So the tree house is a dog house?
Nice!!
according to the coverage area map, it says it is available in my area but all I get is 'session' ended' check back later, and absolutely no customer service.
F*** y**
The tree house is looking NICE!
How do I get a starling system. Well made video.lets gooo camping
That looked like the same gas station that you stealth camped in.
Steve with that self tracking dish you look like an international man of mystery, the dark glasses & beany add to the image. Smart. 😆 Lol M
@12:36 was just thinking you know what two words we used to hear over and over again that we never hear anymore? beautiful wife.  sounds like the blooms off the rose
sweet gear dude
"Not quite a camping video" but damn interesting nonetheless.
<3
I wonder how long it will operate after elon goes underwater after people realize his ideas can't be completed, like this wacky boring company, or a "tesla truck" that was suppose to be out on 2019...
Cool beans.  Yeah, Steve makes mistakes like all of us but I cannot ever see him being 'bad' enough to sleep in the tree house.  Thanks for sharing your journey with us! 💛 From Austin, TX.
So happy for you....FINALLY! Gonna make your job a lot easier for you!
Very fun update!  Really excited for the possibility of further north videos!
Ugh... Steve is gonna get Musk'd :(
Yeha I'm out. I don't support any ody who has anything to do with musk, his company, or products
Since your first network is "Hunker Down" and you're going to use this one when out camping, I'm surprised you didn't call the network "Camping With Steve", but I suppose that may give your location away
Have you considered Stealth Camping in an old barn out in the middle of nowhere?
Steves camping internet is better than my home net in the UK lol.
Elon may be a spoiled rich man child but damn I love his mindset on his investments/companies, truly advancing mankind.   Space X, Starlink, Tesla.   I just can't hate the man no matter how much of an ass he makes of himself in social media.
Tripping with steve
Love you, Steve.
Thanks for the review.  Maybe one day when the price goes down I'll be looking into that.
That better than my home broadband in the UK lol
Hi Steve, thanks for the great video as always.  Hanging out is cool. Be well and safe.
thx for the demo, looks like the Starlink will work nicely out in the middle of nowhere.
Steve! Great video watching from Ireland 🇮🇪!!
Rock and roll !
I think Steve is an outdoor dog .
great video I use mofi  as long as I have cell service I have internet and I pay month to month
Hey. I just tried Dunkin doughnuts ice coffee. & I think it's better. Incredible flavor & no coffee jitters.  Cool video of skylink setup. Extra necessities for someone who's cool with electronics. 👍🤗🍻
When it was offered in my area it was 599 then 99 dollars a month and it wasn't available but I could be an early adopter.  Musk is the best salesman in the world but I can't commit to that.
I can see it now. Steve hidin' behind a tourist sign playing Doom online against some guy in China!
On one hand i love this tech. On the other hand this could make the backcountry sites all the more crowded.
Keep up the good work
Great informative video Steve. As always, its good to see you. The treehouse is really coming along great. Hope everything is going well with your house. 👍😊
Cool channel
My wife and I dream of living on the road in an RV. But we have 5 kids. And her job ties us to a specific spot. And I need internet. Well, at least one of those might be solvable. Yeah, it's probably just a dream. 2 of our kids are on the Autism Spectrum, so we don't know if they'll ever be 100% independent. But we have crossed the country (CA to OH and back twice and then CA to VA) 5 times in a van, so we could probably survive at least a few weeks in an RV with the kids.
Steve! It's fun to watch you regardless if you are camping, stealth camping, building your treehouse, with Crazy Neighbor or testing out your Starlink. I like your low key attitude about it all! Say hello to your Lovely Wife!
How about a woodstove under the treehouse? with floor vents so the hot air can make its way up?
Gettin ‘er done!
At some point   there will be  a channel   or   TV  show   on  camping  ...without  electronics ....     just  being and making your  brain think differently.     And packing  a book as a  time filler.   Novel idea.
After driving for "miles,"  you arrived, opened the box and took out the,  *3:12* - "Stand" "dish". Put them all together and you have... (Drum roll!) Myles Standish  (Sorry, that's all I came up with...)
Always love your vids dude and your vibe is what camping or whatever you want to call it, actually needs. No need to bash peoples styles, your out in nature in one way or another. Stay safe be happy and I'll crack a step2 always with you
“ spaceball ‘s “ !
That's pretty fast internet.
Thanks Steve!
Beer fund at work. My billfold pays for my adventures. No beer fund here....LOLOLOLOLOLOL
I'm surprised it's not a 12v system.
200 mps is really good for a non DSL internet.
Do you give some beer funds to charity bro?
You need a rug to tie the place together ;)
My mother in law has Starlink at her home and it comes in really handy being able to use it for Wifi calling so this is huge for full time RV'ers (and frankly was the last thing that I was hoping/looking forward to so I could move towards full time RV life myself).  Nice to see that it doesn't seem to take much power either which is cool.
This was a great video. I wouldn't call this a mediocre video, b/c I've been curious about Starlink in this application for quite some time. Starlink + Solar + Jackery sounds like an ideal combination. What do you think about getting in your kayak again and taking the Starlink to the island in this video? Bonus points if you do a livestream.
Marshals are on theyre way to  your location
How’s you’re regular work doing ?
Thank you so much for this test/video. We are waiting for the Starlink our selves in polar orbit. Anywho, just an idearrrr... ...what about some gear testing of "Wish" gear -Steve style? Just bear in mind.. things could go booooom... Anywho... (do you need a refill of Aass beer?) Again, thank you for the educational videos. Norwegian campers love the channel!
Better livestream!!!!!
China is about to destroy all that so I wouldn't have faith in it...
Happy Steve Wallis day to everyone!
Love ya man.. Lets get together.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bj-ZF0fUDA4
Steve needs a Jeep Wrangler for exploring and camping when not using the bus!
If you double the size of your solar, you might do better.
I'm old enough now that to me roughing it is when room service doesn't answer till the 3rd ring !!
Great title, this should get people to your channel who weren't necessarily looking stealth camping content. Upvoted!
Ahh, Starlink. Elon Musk is the man. He should be president of the world!!       Great vid, Steve!!  As always, a good one!
Steve, do you have any black friends?
Have you seen the Camp Chef Oven/Range? That would be great in the houseboat, bus or tree-house
Really cool, love it! Musk is making rural life sucks less lol. 4G coverage and pricing in Canada suuucks. I moved from Canada to Europe, and here it's easy to live rural on 4G internet, ie. 300gb/mo with average 45/30mbps for CAD 45/mo.
With starlink and my jackery , I can live for free like a king.
Why would you put your lock on the outside of the treehouse?  Someone could lock you in while you are sleeping.
If there was Wi-FI or Starlink in the treehouse.. I'd be more than happy to live in it!
it's really crazy now that literally anyone can plop one of these dishes out and just get respectable internet
Cool to see the Starlink in action! Great video, Steve :)
Now you can't even hide in  the bush.
EXCELLENT... You're wife Hunker Down in style 😎
I think my idea of heaven is sitting in a comfortably converted camping bus, fitted with solar, power cells, and fast internet so I can game in absolute luxury and isolation.
Hi, I'm a relatively new viewer, so pardon if this has already been said, but I absolutely would not be offended if you posted affiliate links to the products you use! I'm very interested in stuff you use and always forget to research them on my own. Plus as you do the work testing and reviewing, it"s only fair that you also get a few cents thrown your way as well. Please and thank you!
$124 /mo with a one-time $639 upfront cost. Nah, I'm good.
Hoping you’ll still do a collab with Corporals Corner!!!!!!
The exact reason I go camping.  But I get from Steve's point of view.
Were you able to get onto the web?  thanks Steve
🎉 Congratulations 👍
Toyota sucks
damn finally a mobile one
Also the treehouse looks awesome, and looking forward to seeing your roadtrip 😄
Entertaining and educational as always Steve. I am further educated on where to sleep when I'm bad. Safer than the couch
That was actually a very useful video, Steve. This will be a game changer. I wonder how well this can replace a Garmin InReach during emergencies for people who are more vehicle-based overlanding focused than backpacking? Love the treehouse, btw.
I was literally just getting a bit too "wooded" and got paranoid and thought something terrible had happened to Steve.
WAY TO GO STEVE!!! GLAD TO SEE YOUR DOING NEAT CRAP AND STILL NORMAL.  ( DANG. YOU STILL NEED A REGULAR : STEP2. )
Good videos as always Steve! I never thought I’d enjoy your camping/other videos so much haha, but they’re certainly an experience Anyway, I’ve been sick with something since Thursday, but having this video made today a little nicer!
That's not a tree house. Its The Tree Mahal.
Hey Steve its Toren from the igloo camping video from 2020 and i just wanted to say hi! and congrats on 900k!
Thank you for sharing Steve 👍🏼
You're stealth camping  with Starbucks and satellites! LoL you are. Sell out.
Thanks so much, Steve, for showing a simple setup. I have been hesitating thinking I wouldn't be able to figure out how to set it up. Your casual, simple setup took away all of my fears!! Thank you so much. I will now order it.
I hope your channel gets big enough to where when you speak of people Musk they show up on your channel to camp with you and crazy neighbor and have a step 2
Love the tree house, love ALL your content. Nothing mediocre here! Just relaxation and fun without destroying nature ♥️♥️♥️
LOL the tree house is in better shape than the main house 🤣 electricity, eh? When I think how sketchy thst thing was and now it seems like a solid little shelter!
I appreciate your vids for a multitude of reasons Steve! Keep it up!
There is no wrong way to Camp
We have had Starlink at our house in the middle of the country for a couple months now and it is GREAT if you have no other options
If i could play xbox while camping i would camp more. 😂
I was wondering about these Starlinks. Looks like it's worth the price of admission if it's working like that even on an overcast day!
Elon (the rock star) thanks you, my friend!
What a legend. Props from Lisboa.
Let’s get Steve to 1 million ! Happy to be part of your journey Steve, thanks for the vids and endless entertainment!
Steve, I think our ancestors would love to be able to use modern technology for emergency  services.
Yo! That's a legit portable-comms system!!! I like this!
Have you seen ''lnto the Wild''?
If the tree house is your punishment, you will be bad on purpose lol.
The tree house just need a bathroom haha
Brilliant 💚💚👍👍
Been here for 4 years since the honeymoon with beautiful wife. Love all the videos and keep it real. Love it Steve. Ontario is calling…..
Been thinking about gettin this for my cabin. Love the pay when you want to use.
Steve, do you know what that extra 25$/month service tax they charge on top of the 170$ a month is? is that something you have to pay even if you are not using it ? thank you in advance
Didn't you used to have to spend overnights in a McDonald's parking lot to use their WiFi to upload videos? Times and technology have changed!! Should be a very handy tool to have in your line of work.
Awesom to see another video steve keep the amazing Job up
Everyone I've asked about it says it disconnects alot so wouldnt be good for live things like video meetings but soemthing that buffers like watching Netflix etc or general browsing, downloading should be fine.
Of course ya did. Everyone does the same thing on YouTube. =) Love your personality, though. That's for sure.
party 🥳 time
Holy cow those gas pumps @ 1:10 remind me of the 90s
Anyone else hoping Crazy Neighbor was waiting inside the treehouse to say "Welcome back, STEEEEEVE"...?
What you talkin bout steve willis
lol this is faster than my homes internet. And Im moving out to the Okanogan region (washington side) soon and will definitely be needing this.
You make my day 1000 times better when you upload a video! Thank You Steve 👍
You have solar, a battery pack, mobile super fast internet, and a camper bus. I am so envious that it is almost turning into bitter resentment. 😂
How much are the initial costs, and then the monthly costs?
Being able to pause the service during winter is great.
I don't know what your financial situation is, Your business.  BUT to USE your time as you have makes a world of sense in the time we have on earth.  Glad you're sharing it with us!
Love that Tree house!!! Cheers
YouTube is my StarLink to you. You are a star. I watch the link.
School bus! Back of your suv! Now the tree house! How many "huffy beds" does one man need!!👍
that was pretty cool when it auto adjusted its self.
Thanks for the review and explanation. And the tree house looks great!
Thanks for sharing this with us Steve. We're currently working our way through your vids. Love them. We live full time in our RV/Motorhome over here in the UK (filming and uploading our adventures while we travel). So this Starlink is something which peaks my interest somewhat. As of yet though, because the UK is a very small country compared to Canada, our 4g/5g service (on EE) is pretty good in most places. And at only £25 per month unlimited data, it wouldn't be of any benefit for us to switch to Starlink. But I can see a potential there in the future. Gotta love what Elon Musk does. Thanks again Steve. Have a great week ahead!
great insight to the star link thank you Steve.
Internet in the middle of nowhere zero signal area is great. In the better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it sense. Starlink, hmmm. Might get one. Keep on keeping on.
I hope to one day get Starlink when it has better coverage and the unit becomes more convenient (and cheaper) because it isn't fixed and it's LOTS faster than what I can get here, I'm stuck at 35Mbit/s. Edit: Unless Starlink being an option lights a fire under my local ISPs and they finally shape the f*** up. One can dream.
Hey steveeeeeee
Emergencies are reason enough to have internet alone. How much are they? I totally agree with your polar bear precautions. I'd have a big gun with me too.
cool
Ur tree house is looking better.👍. How's the railway going Steve?
Starlink rocks I have at my place and it has a built ìn heater that melts the snow off it.  I power mine with a goal zero 1500watt portable power.
When is crazy neighbor moving in the 🌲 house then he would really be crazy neighbor again
Hi Steve. Crazy Irish guy😎
No It's GREAT to take the new technology and make use of it..... With the world tittering on collapse a person needs the stealth camping with an EYE on the insanity.
It's _"Camping Adjacent"_ with Steve. 😁
Elon saves the day. With a tree house like that I would be bad all the time 😆
Satellites are a myth. All those dishes do is relay to a tower.
i really hate anything musk related. He will be known as the biggest fraudster of the 21th century. I am not familiar with prices etc of satellite internet so i wont say much against starlink as it is as long as it works, esp. if it enables u to upload with more quality of life. Still musk nd his companies are scams. Literally scams. If u dont trust me, u might trust someone who does the science behind it nd explains it, aka phil mason.  quick edit im at 0:50 ah ye that was part of the starlink scam "acessable internet everywhere " well except that u werent allowed to put it up anywhere else, well now u are but u pay not just 200 bucks more a month.... for worse connection and u are obligated to sign a several year long contract where u can only Pause Some months payment? man ... srsly .... Musk is such a fraudster.
early video you spoil us Steve
First like then watch
nice gadget to have for emergency internet where can you get them Steve
"Sleeping there when I'm bad"   Beautiful Wife " You're in the doghouse now!"  Steve "Nope, I'm in the treehouse" ;)
Elonnnn sorry lol let's get it
Looks good.  Hopefully it will work for you on your outings.
Awesome! Grab some step 2s and let's goooo
Hi Steve have you worked out your car roof storage issue yet ? Love your content BTW
Yes Steve camp on that island in the lake..👍🙂😁😉
I’ve been stalking your channel today waiting for your video to drop 😂
I really want to get starlink for the house. Just wondering how fast the connection speed is. I know what it say but what is it really
Hmmm, rent out the treehouse, “Steve’s Hunker Down and Breakfast.”
You helped me get off my ptsd meds by showing me a healthier solution. Camping and fishing have become me and my family's go to. Thank you, brother! And please keep the great content comin.  Much love!
That's much faster than I was expecting. My last house I was getting 60 down 20 up on cable internet, better ping tho I would imagine.
Love the tree house Steve!
You should mount you a street legal dirt motorcycle to your bus.  That way if you had a break down you would have a help vehicle to save the day.  plus it is nice to scope out the area when you set up your bus for camping.  I have found it is good for step 2 runs.
Cheers Steve, love the channel and your content…
The mobile starlink setup looks awesome 👌
That upload speed is twice as fast as mine on Cox cable internet.
That trip to the Arctic ocean sounds like a fun idea. Can't wait for that trip to come!
5:39 "unhealthy" lollllll
Good times!   just started... Coming back with edits as we go!
great vid Stevie
Got ours delivered to Ontario last week!
I wondered how those worked! Much love Steve and beautiful wife! Ya'll are wonderful 🍻
fake and hoax,  not buying it
How fast is your home internet?
new tech like this is cool!
Thanks for reviewing Starlink. I trust your view.  It was wierd looking at you pumping your own gas....in Oregon we can't do that 😁
Sup Steve? Just wondering if you have any ideas or teasers for when you hit that million?  Gotta be huge😜
Cor a squarieal! Haven’t seen one of them in years 😂
You know, if it actually links to the stars, the aliens can send us the dankest alien-grade memes ever.
🍻👍🏼🍻
It would be cool to see Steve on rogan imo
I'm happy to watch "[Blank] with Steve." Fill in the blank Steve!
300 views a minute, damn boy!
This is the future with Steve!
heck yeah
I've been looking for a good internet solution for my own adventures. Definitely appreciate your insight! Great video as always!
starlink will lead to a transhumanism/surveillance state in the future; while it's used to deliver military weapons in minutes now.
Hello from Norway. I was going to bed, but now I wanna stay up watching this clip...Love your channel... Stay safe!
Perfect timing, already got step 2 in hand. Thanks Steve !
Thats actually crazy 😂 That starlink is getting better Up and Down Download and Upload speed then i get at my appartment a HOUR OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO 😂😂😂 Nuts
No offense Steve,but you said we were getting a real vid today...not a review vid. How disappointing. Bummer.
*aaaand its even more expensive than before :)* the regular plan costs 10% more too btw.   to compete they will have to get cheaper sometime, even LTE in germany makes more sense till this day, even though we have really poor coverage. it'll still broadcast through the woods tho.. that is not a thing with starlink
Elon Musk for the win.....again!
This guy has lost touch with what started this channel. I have no need to support this. Sorry steve but this is my out. good luck.
Hi Steve 👋:) Happy memorial day!
I thought that the whole purpose of camping was to get away from all the technology and commune with nature?
my favorite ASMR
Looking forward to review, it looks very interesting. 👍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿👍
Hey Steve ❗❗❗❗👋👋👋
I would of figured that "step 2" was the password for "hunker down"
Elon+Steve Collab otw
Steve, I would love to see you and crazy neighbour making some home brew. Could turn into quite an enterprise...."Hunker down beer". I'd buy some!
It’s great
I love Thursdays! Wait...
