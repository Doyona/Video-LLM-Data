Airpost -oh  used to say I would never fall in love💖💏 🤧😍
Did anyone else see that guy light a cig?
I’ve only ever seen Messi once. If I don’t see him play now that I’m going to see him, I’m going to cry  😂😂
“ I’m going bold “ clearly 😂😂😂
i wish i could play football with you guys i use to play all positions except on wing or full back great content as always hope the operation goes well i do have twitter twitch discord insta same as my youtube name
neymar better
you can just see how drunk chris is progressively throughout the video 🤣, had me in tears
Just a couple lads
amazing video as always, keep it up
It’s 1-1 to Juventus 🤣
4:06 that "crèpes kinda thing" is called PIADINA and for fuck sake next time eat it whit your hands. (Yes, i'm italian)
8:02 that laugh 😂😂
Tf is Chris editing on his computer  He posts once  a month if lucky
VIP is so high up?
That dog looks like a wolf
Bro...theo... what bangers r u producing...keep it up paul
Video is so wholesome, 2 football fans going to watch chanpions league, keep up Theo!!
haha great vid theo
Only time Arsenal fans will watch the champions league
Is this video about food now
You gotta understand messi is not playing 100%. He barely runs sometimes. He doesn’t want to miss the world cup. If you want to see how messi still can play go watch the match against italy in the finalissima. You could see that explosive messi. Obviously it’s not a prime messi but still pretty great
There's no way he cuts his hand grating carrots then 10 seconds later says he is ''grateful'' without acknowledging that pun xD
Is it just me or I think Theo and Chris has a very good connection. Love the content
That is one very cute DOG
I need to do this for my little dude before Messi hangs up his boots
Guy behind you is a pro 🤣 plays for Bologna
WHAT A EDIT! LOVED THE TING WITH NANDOS!!!
Hydrogen peroxide on the blood stain.
louie binks is sat behind you and he’s a pro player 😂😂
Legend.
Legend of the rings.
Oll
Theo is the type of youtuber you will actually have the subscriber bell on for
Theo you look like the green green grass guy enough, you don't need to dress like him as well
What’s VIP about this though 😂😂
It is a Siberian husky not a wolf I have 2 of them
I love Cal... but that name for a clothing company is clapped haha what happened to krox?
Its called VIP psg seats. A player is never bigger then the club, which is why PSG always sucks.
Idk if they were supporting psg or juve
They don't look like vip seats to me 🤔😂
It’s a Wolf 😂😂😂
4:00 it’s a WOOF!
And my goat 🥺
And my goat 🥺
And my goat 🥺
MESSSSI BEST PLAYER!!!!
It’s gonna get Messi ✨HoIhOiHoI✨
Hj
where was the VIP tho?
1:1 to uv as the. Champions league anthom
Oh right I didn’t realise it was against uv I was like is that not in Italy and Allianz was UVS home stadium
need me a best friend like Theo 😤
Ofcourse it's becoz of the height 😭🤣
Video ruined when thogdick showed up.
For messi to still have that burst of pace and come up with a moment of magic when he's called on is still magical especially at his age. Seen glimpses of his old self this season.
“1-1 to juventus” 😂
I thought you were going to actually talk to Messi.
2nd goat. Behind CR7
chris is streaming by the end
i like how thogden is being recognized a lot more its really nice too see
Chris and Theo are absolutely amazing lads ❤
Recently got into Theo’s videos, seems like a lovely fella. But the thogden count is far too high in this one, cannot stand him
Where tf was the second goal
This vid was class
Get joe weller involved
Bro if chrismds idol is Messi then it explains why he is so short (no hate towards to Chris)
'1-1 to Juventus' 🤣🤣🤣
The way he said 1-1 to juventus lol
https://youtube.com/shorts/CCnOaD06T2k?feature=share
That’s was wholesome
I was today years old when I found out that Nando's sell Breakfast!
OMG you guys were actually under my house in Turin and I didn't even notice.  FUUUUUUUUCKKKK ahahaha
I love this great video😂
Ofc you chose messis worst game this season🤣
5:45 it was at this moment I actually understood how short Chris really is… 🤣🤣
Why isnt neymar in the title, hes 300x better than mbappe
Thogden being in this video ruined it, that bloke is an absolute cancer to the football community
0:12 what video is this from?
Theo slowly turning into a messi fan I see…😉
wtf is vip about those seats lmao
LOVED THIS VID MATE
2nd goal who scored it bc you didn’t show it
Lmao Ronaldo breaks a kids phone 😂
chris md chearing juve so that he shouldnt get beaten up by those fans 😂
The Thris romance, I love it
Is it just me who loves this freindship
I’m so confused. Chris’ favorite player is literally Ronaldo
Im gutted how thogden came without thogdad 😔
Great video… come on Chris put some respect on ronaldos name too man
Fun Fact: Messi and Neymar never stay to say thanks to the PSG fans after the game after they started booing them a while back. And rightly so if you don't appreciate them you don't deserve their thanks either lol
1-1 to juventus
Lol didn’t Chris fanboy Ronaldo a few years ago? 💀
Misse is a gooooooooo9oooooooood
It would be funny if Theo used the 10 k Chris gave him
10:29 Did a guy just lit a fag in the background, you allowed to smoke at stadiums in Italy??
What jacket is chris wearing ??
Those 2 are such an amazing duo. Always putting smiles on our faces. Love their personalities!🙌
Juventus is one of my fav teams but now they have fallen
Wait wait....nandos do breakfast?
143252nd
This make a wish kid, really needed this. I must thank you on behalf of this child
Which vid is at 10 seconds at the beginning?
Honestly have been saying for the past 2 years can’t wait for Theo to get more followers than Joe. Theo’s been hanging around with the right people always stays consistent and you can tell he’s a genuine and decent guy!
Ah, my favourite club Messi and Mbappe!
wolf wolf its a wolf  🤣funniest part
Only people who didn’t come from tik tok are worthy of liking this
20 mins before kick off and it's empty outside the stadium because everyone is already inside because its 20 MINUTES BEFORE KICK-OFF.
❤
Chris has literally met Ronaldo lol
It would be better  if it was in 1 month and an in an international game with Messi vs Ronaldo
I can't stand thogden tbh
HE SAID VIP TICKETS?!?!?!
theo and chris so good
If Theo had taken him to the UCL game of Barcelona VS Juventus 2 years ago to see the real GOAT, he would know who the real goat is.
i like this little scripted friendship Theo and Chris have. Great for views.
This is so wholesome 😂😂😂
I think there secretly gay lovers
geez green screens are getting good
Lovely video but the clickbait on VIP seats lol c'mon theo this were nosebleed seats
Messi is the goat but does he have shannon?……
Hy
❤❤❤
Me as a Benfica fan waiting for Theo to film the PSG fans realising we got 1st place and not them....🥺 Still great content though! Loved Thogden first appearance is in a random pub having a pint🤣
nice to see you both in my hometown!!! that "crepes kinda thing" is called piadina
thx mate. chris is one of my fav utubers and it makes me proud that u would do this for him
GOD BLESS IN JESUS MIGHTY NAME AMEN 🙏🙌✝️🕊️❤️!!!
2:27 song by Rema Dumebi 😊❤️🇳🇬
Theo tasting any food: "This is amazing, best food I ever had in my life".
NO WAY, I WAS AT THE GAME AND DIDN'T SEE YOU OMG I SAT BELOW YOU. I'm a big big fan and have been following for like 7 years I actually don't believe I could've met u guys and didn't. Probably won't get another chance to😔
did anyone else see theos face become super red at the end of the vid? HAHA
What a guy
Sheeesh these r tooo good
10:58 he said 1-1 juventus 🤣
Theo and Chris podcast?
how is it a vip tickets ?
You should have gone to Benfica PSG…
Wtf Nando’s breakfast never knew that was even a thing
6:10 Chris with the tap in
Bro...theo... what bangers r u producing...keep it up paul
Quesadilla…it’s called a quesadilla
Big up Theo for putting a spotlight on a smaller creator
Two mates enjoying each others company. What’s not to like?! Great vid Theo 👍
Who else heard Dumebi by Rema (Nigerian song) playing in Nandos?
You two hot unlucky with one of the most boring match🤣🤣
Ronaldo goes down tunnel without clapping fans he gets absolute peltars messi goes down tunnel without clapping fans and he is the goat
Its was 2 1 lol
Messi or ronaldo ??
What a banger. Can’t wait until Arsenal are in the UCL so I can play “whoever finds Theo first wins” around the Emirates 😂
Is it just me or am I really enjoying the Chris and Theo content recently
Nando’s breakfast 👀
Theo
Kind of spoils by thogdens vlog
Great video!
What the hell is a 'carrot grater'?
The goat with the goat with the goat
Legend ❤️👑👑 keep it up and up 😍
Football is the best I love football football is the best 😊😊😊
HAHA I love how before every football game Thogden is just in a pub nearby sinking pints
Cheers mate, Keep on going big bakey
Don't you disrespect Milik like that XD
Love your videos bro 🤍
Theo 👨‍🍳
Oh messi is injured.. Now
Psgs 2 goal logged out
Wish I had friend like u who would take me to one of Messi's game.
Baker is a real one
Bro the content had been epic. You should do a Theo vs ChrisMD football challenge and whoever wins gets £1m from the opponent who looses
The GOATs went to watch the GOAT
Am I next? 😂
