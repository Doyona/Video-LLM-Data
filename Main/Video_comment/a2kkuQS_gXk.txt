Tsunoda is going to pull a Bottas today in the sprint.
Lewis should've pitted
Goatifi P3
STOP THE “HOW” ADS
imagine w no one on the grid and they'd be like "lights out and no one goes"
1 Man army the great lewis
2:50 Rare sighting of Latifi on a podium spot.
Woahh ocon won the Hungarian GP thats shocking I thought he is a mid driver 💀
Alonso is a Legend
𝙰𝚗𝚢𝚘𝚗𝚎 𝚑𝚎𝚛𝚎 𝚒𝚗 𝟸𝟶𝟸𝟻👀?
What a tactics by Mercedes  Still lost the wdc 😂
This was Ocons first win. Awesome race.
what a race this was,remember watching it live couldn't belive a second,a car thats like 0.800 slower winning the gp
lance stroll ruining F1 by crashing into leclerc🤣
True there 👍
Hamilton Goat ❤
Where to watch full race ?
If I was in the place of Ocon I would have been grateful to Alonso for lifetime
DU DU DU DU Max Verstappen
Bottas identified as a bowling ball this day
Peak Hamilton was a problem!
Because hamilton took to many pitstops
Toto: "we need to take down both RedBul cars" Bottas: "hold my beer"
No one talking about Schumacher in tenth with that shopping trolley?
Who came from the f1 edit of this 👇
Well hello 2025
This race was a fever dream
Bottas did plan c
레드플렉 이후 재스타트 하기위해 피트에서 그리드로 정렬하는 과정에서 해밀턴 제외한 모든 드라이버가 인터미디어에서 슬릭타이어로 교체후 레이스가 시작되고 해밀턴이 섹터1빠져나갈때 피트레인 스타트 하는과정에서 출구쪽에 모든 차들이 모여있어서 저 상황 나온거로 기억합니다
Is this Rosberg talking ? 4:15
I really miss this cars
One of my favorite race starts ever.  Lol.  And as  much as I can't stand Ocon, I love this race because it REALLY showed how amazing Alonso could still be when called on.  One of his best stints off all time.
Oh that was Mercs attempt at winning at F1 through bowling. Incredible they werent punished for using the second driver to take out the competition at the start.
0:13
Bowlingottas
5:48 Through goes Lewis Hamilton before silverstone
has david croft gone back and re-recorded these commENTARIES WITH EVEN MORE YELLING!!?
When Alonso said over the radio during another race “tell Ocon to defend like a lion” this is what he was talking about
Why is there 2 starts?
Thank you alonso❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
why Hamilton didn’t pitted at start with soft tyre instead of changing wet tyres on 2nd lap ?
5:15 "You can hear the Cheers of the Crowd" - David Crofty  Foreshadowing Curse Commentary in 2023 and 2024 when that commentary hurt George Russell Final Lap
Ocon>>>>>>>
Still seeing this 😂😂
Can someone explain why Hamilton not going into Pit for tyre change was a problem here? The race just started, tyres are fresh. Why would you want to change them?
Latifi>>>Verstappen
Alonso hates Hamilton
wow haha
Verstappen wasn't lucky
2025 better deliver
What a race
GOATIFI
2:00 Is that Ted Kravitz?
How did they get Verstappen’s car going again?
I was really sad that Vettel ended up DSQd, I was so happy for his second.
After this race, Bottas got an extension of his contract.
Latifi was on the podium
0:35 Bowling Strike From Bottas And Who's Here Lando Norris Let Oscar Piastri To The Lead And Take His First Career Win To Become First Team As A Teammate To Take First Career Win Since Juan Pablo Montoya And Ralf Schumacher 2001 Season
Hamilton last to 3rd! Nice!!!
Everything cars is slow like a Hamilton
Unexpected winner...
Nicolás GOATifi with 12 overtakes in the first corner 🐐
And then they say, max didn't deserve the title...
And then they say, max didn't deserve the title...

Vettel wouldn' have won even with a Better pit stop, and i am a Vettel fan
Who's here after Alpine ditched their only race winner for the last race?
Valterri Bottas in the 2021 Hungarian GP
max really lost potential 50+ points due to no fault of his own this championship. Silverstone, baku and hungary
I'm back for Ocon's 2024 Sao Paulo GP P2.
0:26 Charles 🌧
“Lights out and away we go for Lewis Hamilton only” will never fail to make me laugh (edit: spelling)
Wait is this hungarian gp hamilton compilation??
Total joke of Bottas, which almost won Lewis the title.
Wuckert Dale
très bon très bien formidable Alpine.... i love Crofty
How did Ocon win but Alonso didn't??
Llewellyn Mission
At least Max didnt need that one point in Abu Dhabi 😂
The most fun series.
can't believe Latifi finished above Verstappen, truely my GOAT
Hamilton started on his own and still lost
Stroll just destroyed Leclercs race lol
Why did I just got this recommended?
Mad race 🤣
Se alla ripartenza sarebbe andato ai box Hamilton avrebbe vinto il mondiale 2021...
When lewis passed alonso the gap to vettel was 9 sec 3 laps left, end of the race it was below a sec, wow  lewis literally flying
Here after Ocon announce his move to Haas
But here goes ugiviba💀
Ocon wins the Hungarian gran prix! I love that part but congratulations to Alonso for defending like a champ the help Esteban
Latifi :D
Que mala estrategia de Mercedes
Hamilton esteve envolvido em quase todas as batalhas nas últimas décadas!
2021 Hungary: Ocon first win 2024 Hungary: Piastri first win
And now we have a brand new race winner at Hungary in 2024. Congrats Oscar Piastri!!
Who's watching before 2024 Hungarian  gp?
Toto Wolff to Bottas before the first corner: *Valtteri, execute order 66!*
Mazepin and Stroll doing what they do. Ah memories!😂
Goatlonso
When F1 still used the amazing Sky Sports commentators, nowadays it is bogus commentators... 2021 was a season like no other!!
Oconnnnnnnn
2024 anyone?
2024 and this race still iconic
That commentary is maaaaad!!!!
Alonso wrapped and gifted winning trophy to thankless Ocon.  Next time Ocon had to defend and Alonso said it to Engineer, ask Ocon to defend like Lion 😂
Mercedes did that on purpose to take out both redbulls as they were not able to beat them
Ocon drove nicely. However, if Alonso hadn't defended like a lion against Hamilton, he had a high chance of catching up to Ocon and winning the race. And we all know how Ocon repayed Alonso afterwards. A selfish driver indeed.
Vettel......
Hamilton on the line by himself is such an iconic shot especially in that black Merc
Vhat noooooooooooo😅😂
Alpine Esteban Ocon wins Hungarian Grand Prix 👏😃
Alonso you absolute beast 🔥
1:22 😂
Who is here after finding out that Ocon is leaving Alpine at the end of 2024?
Who’s watching this after seeing the news that Ocon will be dropped by Alpine at the end of the 2024 season?
Who's watching this race after finding out that Esteban Ocon is leaving Alpine at the end of the 2024 season?   I mean despite Ocon not doing well with Alpine in the later years, this race will always be the best one where he performed well.   I mean Alonso did defend well from Hamilton for at least 10 laps but Ocon did defend well from Vettel which is underrated. After all Ocon still has given Alpine their first win.
Who's watching this after seeing that Ocon is not gonna stay with Alpine for the foreseeable future?
Great dive by stroll still forcing why he deserves the seat 🫡
Ocon should thank Alonso for this one.  What a bulldog of a teammate Alonso.  Dude is a beast.  😎
GOOOO OCON GOOO
Why '? Lewis start alone...?
Such a swell teammate Bottas 😅
Hamilton ❤😊
Primeira Vitória De Esteban Ocon, E Da Equipe Alpine🏎🇫🇷
Guy had an ocon in his pants
Très bon Ocon !
Back when alpine actually lead grand prix😂
Now we understand DRS era drivers can't fight well after Russell crashed  easily by art of defense from Alonso.
-New race winner -Entertaining battles -Unique weather -Williams double points -Vettel podium  This race had it all
Miss this type of battles, was so much more exciting back then 😂
Hamilton alone on the track, is one of the most bizarre moments in the history of the sport. Imagine having to explain this to someone who has never watched Formula 1 😂
Guys this race is completely rigged ….. allow me to explain ……  According to fia rule book article 69, there should at least be a 5 second time penalty to mr ocon because why not , This is very unfair and should be reported …..why tf is it only me who realised this??
Who is are the 3 commentators? David Croft, ?, ?
This was the first ever f1 race I’ve watched and what a great one!
3:15 Latifi third is poetic 😅
Riccardo would have won if lance stroll didn't hit Leclerc into Riccardo
Ocon has a 5 second penalty for winning
Ocon celebra y ganó gracias Alonso, la única victoria en su carrera no la consiguió por el, que tipo más chanta
If max hadn’t won the championship this would be as infamous as spa 2012
2:21 Ma-Ma-Mazepin, Sale a pista y hace spin~
Hajrá Hamilton
Looking at this race, looking at Silverstone, Baku, Bahrain, Monaco, Turkey amongst others, I don't know how people think it was Masi that cost them the WDC and not the countless mistakes form Mercedes and Lewis.
for lewis hamilton only 🤣
Valtteri, "Bowling Time"
Clearly Bottas' true Forte is bowling.
Hungary 🇭🇺
Did Bottas lock his left tire?
Sainz strategy 🎉
Imagine if it was Perez crashing into others instead of VB, Toto and his fanboys would still be crying about foul play.
Mercedes Demolition Derby team
What a surprising win for Alpine.
Wait I thought I we were watching car racing not bowling
bottas bowling
Still one of the best races
F1 online lobby in real life
Strike!
bowling bottas
If the race had one more lap lewis hamilton would be a 8 time world champion
0:17 horrible crash lol
Botas.....:DDDDDDDD big cheek idiot!!!!!!
Ocon doesn't deserve the win
i miss actual racing
Watching this in 2023, still got goosebumps!
One of the best races of the decade
Vettel is the best😊😊😊
now that's drama
The year is 2023, Zhou has done the same with both Alpines. He's learnt from the master.
Ironically, Bottas' current teammate did slightly similarly at T1 on the 2023 opening lap.
BOTTAS : mission accomplished both targets neutralised
bottas got paid
hopefully we get a similar race this year but If it's dry it may be rather dull
10 pin bowling
At last a bit of actual racing
This is why Max deserved the championship. Mercedes terrorism.
I come back to this race from time to time when I need an inspiration 😊
Bowling pins
Bottas orders accompleshed,, very well,, 😅
Ocon Vettel and Latifi the first three ones during lap 14. Stunning
I'm back for what proved Latifi's best-ever results in his short-ish F1 career now that he's a former racing driver.
0:12 0:34 Bottas thought he was playing a game of snooker 🎱 😂
Cuando Bottas hacia el trabajo sucio de Mercedes jajaja
Its Bottas playing the ultimate team game here😬, Botass is a legend
Here after Estie Bestie's interview eith Matt & Tommy
The Mercedes way of winning. Bravo bravo
It’s weird to think that if Lewis just pitted for softs…he’d be an 8 time wdc
Most insane f1 race iver ever watched, if anyone can direct me to a race any more chaotic please do
0:34 If this was another team instead of mercedes, we'd remember this as crashgate 2.0
I still believe bottas was told to crash into both red bulls
NICO IN COMENTATE?
And still say that Lulu was robbed of his 8th WDC I Abu Dhabi?
I was just waiting for Bottas to say - over the radio - 'yep, that is it. I got the job done'. What a doormat, that guy.
0:30
for anyone watching this the podium was actually ocon, Hamilton sainz as vettel got disqualified later on
You know, i was watching someone playing f1 manager 22, and bottas ALSO took out 2 red bulls in japan😂😂 (Btw it was an araava vid, what would you expect)
What à strike
Bottas was on a mission to take out two redbulls
Anyone here after Ocons podium at Monaco!
Karma for Hamilton...
I didnt remember this race and im laughing so much
Hamilton was almost the “human error champion” due to Bottas’s error at 0:14
team spirit though lol
Thanks bottas, match fixing brat
My first watched grand prix
Hamilton should have won that race. I mean he was the only one to began the race on the starting grid.
Alonso is the only guy in F1 that can do nearly everything with any car. The best show of defense
How much was Bottas paid to take out the Red Bulls?
This is probably the funniest race I've ever seen 🤣🤣
Bottas master class
This race is proof of 2 things. Alonso is still a beast, and Hamilton is excellent at wheel to wheel racing. As is Alonso.
So noone is gonna talk about how vettel finished 2nd?
Top
The way he hit that C on Ocon's name tho
This was my very first gp i ever watched of f1, oh boy was it incredible.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
get ın there lewıs
a
Go ricciardo!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
That was pure Intention of Bottas 🤷🏽‍♂️
Gp ungheria 2021
6:08 No one is challenging Ocon for the win now  Esteban Ocon is gonna be A GRAND PRIX WINNER IN FORMULA ONE  OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX!!! One of the best commentaries I’ve ever heard!❤
Hungary 🇭🇺
Gutted for Vettel for this one. 2nd place taken away
Tbh I’m glad Ocon beat Vettel because I wouldn’t be able to live in this world if the FIA took that win away from Seb.
Watching this after seb retire. Seb seriously got that pace if 2022 car was fast like 2021 car
That commentator voice is so annoying... hope they got rid of him now
One of the best F1 races in history, legendary start crush, that day made me an active F1 fan
Are they at home?
yorum
This was so great seeing this back then, with Alonso fighting like the Champion he was to secure Ocon the win. And in the victory lap you could see Ocon pointing over to him, saying, I made it because of you. That's what teamwork is supposed to be.
I just know Alonso saw Hamilton in his mirror and had a flashback so big he turned into a wall.
Bottas was the best team mate to Lewis at the start, taking out Lewis rival.
Execute Operation 77.
1 year laster Red Bull is over the buged cap hm this could be one of the reasons 🙂
0:12 Bottas goes into Norris & Both Red Bull cars. Stroll goes into Leclerc while Ricciardo spun round.  Red flag 🟥 1:23 Race restart  2:08 HAM in pit with fresh set of medium tyres.  2:30 MSC v VER  3:22 HAM overtakes VER, RIC  3:35 OCO v VET for P1  4:28 2 legends battle. ALO v HAM  6:10 Esteban OCON P1, Hamilton P2, Sainz P3.
2022 has had no race of this calibre
Alonso defends like a Lion to help his team mate win a Grand prix
a chaque fois que je regarde le replay je lache une larme
Latifi first points and that too 4.
Alonso was the winner here
5:44 wait,  why Hamilton used DRS if he passed Sainz already? is that legal?
If Hamilton won this race, he would have won his 8th championship... Beast Alonso stopped him from doing so...
Alonso is the winner here.
Dos hispanos le costaron el título de 2021 a Hamilton: Alonso (español) en Hungría y Pérez (mexicano) en Abu Dabi.   Two Hispanics cost Hamilton the 2021 title: Alonso (Spanish) in Hungary and Pérez (Mexican) in Abu Dhabi.
6:39
What the heck is an Aston Martin Mercedes? 😂😂
Man what a drive for Hamilton
The man did everything he could to help his teammate.
This race had everything, crazy wet bowling start, lights out hamilton only, Alonso’s lionhearted defense of Lewis, ocons first win. Truly a race for the ages, an instant classic
Lewis Hamilton's ambition is very big, he never backs down.
These 10 points cost Hamilton the championship in 2021, had they changed the tyres instead of being too smart, it would be an altogether a different story at the end of the season.
Hungary 2021: Alonso blocks Hamilton and give Ocon his first and only win in f1  Hungary 2022: Ocon blocks Alonso and shows his real face and how he doesn't even care about the team
Hugarian f1 race results
あ
avisame cuando estas viendo
Verstappen really doesn’t know how to race. He just hit schumi. I mean its ridiculous
look at what sebastian could do man if he had a great car :(
Ocon nice
Gonna miss seb
Shouting commentary is embarrassing
Best Race ever seen
Russell overtakes everyone in pit lane like he is in India.
Whats the name of the narrator?
Such a great race!
Alonso is a f***ing G!
This race had everything!!!
I hope this year Hamilton doesn`t get on podium. Or ever after.  I want Max, George and leclerc. With lewis crashing into a wall.
This is where Hamilton lost the championship.
And they say Verstappen world championship wasn't deserved because of Abu Dhabi, he was sent off multiple times that season
pasti seru banget kalau nonton live
I know it’s fu**in crazy
Who else is here from 2022?
didnt know vettel wasdisqulaified
I'm only for Hamilton
lewsor hamilton.. love to see this selfish guy loose
When Max does it its dangerous driving but when Alonso does it its fantastic defending y'all are hypocrites😂
Drivers aim for P1 and be the race champion, Alonso's best achievement is to block Hamilton 😂
“Ocon wins the Hungarian gp” gives me goosebumps
Amazing.
Just rewatching this before the 2022 Hungarian GP. I can't imagine it getting anywhere close to as mad as this race was!
A full year has passed since Bottas and Stroll decided to play Bowling in Hungary.
What's weird is that on F1 TV they have Natalie Pinkham and not crofty
Everyone talks about Alonso’s defence, but the real reason Ocon won was Latifi’s amazing defence that let Vettel and Ocon get away
Lewis is an amazing driver. Beautiful to watch!!!
This was after Silverstone Max get 1pt  in these races after knocked out both times by Mercedes but yeah he robbed the championship🤣
Ocon with his first win. Sebastian getting his podium for Aston Martin. Hamilton fighting to the podium. Great race
Bottas pitching the most expensive round of bowling ever.
HOPING FOR MERCEDES DOUBLE PODIUM. HAMILTON 8TH WDC 2022.
Almost time for this years race and man I loved this one last year. Botta’s proving he is the best teammate in the first turn.
At this point i realize that Alonso also deciding 2021 championship winner
What if alonso had same fast car.
Did RAI get a penalty  for taking Mazespin out???
Bottas...
The First F1 race I've ever seen. Been hooked to the sport ever since.
Honestly the new era of cars came too soon, should have waited till 2024. the new cars are cool but here we are half way through the season and these highlights are 10x better than anything we've seen all year in 2022. I will re-watch the 2021 season probably more than any other season it was like a year long movie. truly spectacular. now were seeing the problems of 2021 in 2022 really come to light. track limits, Fia decisions. etc.
Alonso deserved a penalty
I think Hamilton loved McQueen
This was one of the greatest race for 2021 epic battle all the way .. and lewis showing what he's made of  pure talent .. .. team work with the alpine was fire .. trebon trebien an formidabla 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:35 foreshadowing for 2022
also cant stand listening to rosberg, his comentry and opinion is so biased against lewis he wreaks of envy
You realize that this was a crazy race by Latifi finishing over Max
This commentator is such a legend .
no way Nico Rosberg comment
Also its fun how Latifi was 3rd at some point
OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX!!!
Max should not bang micks tyre
"Its lights out and away we go for Lewis Hamilton ONLY!"
maFIA ❤ hamilton
alonso is giga chad
Shameful fake crowd cheers from Sky here.
it will be much more better without speaker. he is so annoying.
i rewatch this once in a while when i need my entertainment
1:25 2005 us gp flashbacks intestifies

Botitas ejecuta orden 66
This is a classic
2:38 "Hamilton cant get past Gasly:  Imola 2022: Sound familiar?
Hamilton threw so many points away in 2021
As usual I'm having to mute David Croft...
Fun fact :- All the 3 teams on the finish line were happy for Ocon because he has driven for all three team in one form or the another
DSQ for Vettel, Unable to provide a fuel sample
Literally « we race as one «
Ocon is a joke
MERCEDES PLANNED CRASH IN FIRST LAP
This is the craziest starting i have ever seen
you know what's the actual human error? not winning this race after getting pole and main rival taken out
0:13  NICO, ITS ROMAN! LETS GO BOWLING!
Vettel😭😭😭
This was definitely one if not the crasiest race of the season
I like when lewis started alone💔😅
What a drive from Lewis Hamilton from 14th to 3rd
Aquí la pregunta es, Bottas qué haces?
This race and commentary was so curesed
This feels like 2005 Indianapolis
wp ocon
Im so glad ocon won there. Im so glad he did :3 Great job ocon. sorry for the late comment. but for that race Well done!
Indianapolis 2005: I have the most unusual Grand Prix start!  Budapest 2021 : hold my beer !
Ff
"OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX" we all loved that
1:18
Let's go Hamilton go 🥶🙏😁
The best incredible race of 2021 season.
Hamilton is unbelieveable. The Goat for a reason
ok there was a lot going on at once, i couldn't keep up lol
With all the controversy of Silverstone and Brazil and Saudi and Abu Dhabi, people forget this. This was a classic. It had it all. Carnage 🟢 Wheel to wheel racing 🟢 Individual battles 🟢 Bizarre moments 🟢 A nice change with different people at the top 🟢 El plan 🟢 In any other season, this would go down as a race that’d be compared to Canada 2011 and Brazil 2019
I'm still scratching my head about why Hamilton didn't pit at the restart. Valterri gave him the race on a silver platter and that move cost him, but gave us spectators a fantastic race.
Love coming back to this race from time to time. Just HOW this happened still eludes me, what chaos!
I'm still so confused what Stroll is doing in that first corner. How much reaction time does one need to NOT just ram someone into his side?
Crazy how they left Hamiltons vs Alonso out of DTS completely...
When you realize drive to survive didn’t include one clip of Alonso’s defense …
One of the best races of the season, if not the best
Alonso: meet Spanish minister of defence Hamilton: :/
Bottas bowling
Woohoo Vettel.......
"This race has been manipulated man"
I have this track so much,it's all just slow turns and one straight
This is the race where Lewis lost title. And thanks to Alonso his old rival 🤣🤣
I liked how Stroll decided to Tbone Leclerc while the chaos caused by Bottas unfold infront of him, double whammy
Could you imagine if hamilton boxed aswell, then no one would've started the race. I think crofty would've had a breakdown because no one would get underway
Liwis e o maior
Schumacher really showed his ability here
6:38 reminded me of Monza when the McLaren's drove next to each other at the end of the race
Alonso was class. !!
Superbe
Aston martin was robbed
Lucky con😌😌
1:25 Probably the oddest race start ever in f1 history 🤣🤣🤣
What Bottas’s whee position right after hitting Lando. Kinda sus 🧐
This should've been the race that got the extended highlights 😔
I remember valllteri on the pre race truck show saying it's all about the team game here against the Mercedes multiple times it made me think he was onto something 🤣🤣
Waw highlights footage of Vettel in P2 fighting for P1 many laps, which year am I in 🤣😍
This has to be the craziest restart ever
Alonso and Ocon are one of the very best driver pairings in F1.
VEttel really tried to get that win, but his car was slower and Ocon defended well. (Sigh)
This race was unforgettable.
Hamilton didn't deserve the title because of his own action at silverstone and this race teammate did.  Poetic justice.
Just rewatching this now, and the absolute brass neck of Russell to try and jump everyone else in the pit exit and think he’d get away with it. I think he’ll struggle mentally next season being no. 2 to Lewis, I don’t think he has it in him like checo, valterri, rubens and the other great second drivers
Was a banana crazy race, that point from Max was absolutely crucial for the championship. Bottas Mercedes Tactic questionable...
Epic Fernando defense
Si el DRS se puede usar solo estando a menos de un segundo del automovil de adelante, por que LH activo el DRS en hungria 2021 luego de adelantar a Sainz? se puede apreciar la maniobra en el 5:40
DILE MAGIC QUE TU NO ERES UN MIMADO ... DILE LO QUE HACES CON UNA TARTANA ...
What a race one of my favourites of the season
The first ever Grand Prix I watched 😍
lucy's strategy was quite strange back then :))..hard  to be a champion...oh he is not anymore..btw fanboys, gather your tears for w13 because it seems that it will use tears just like w12 did.
Darth Toto: "Commander Bottas, the time has come. Execute Order 66."  Commander Bottas: "It will be done, my lord."
moment in history
“Hamilton has got the pace advantage” Literally the story of the turbo hybrid era.
Best commentator
Vettel still in second place in 2021 just like 2011
I’m mad this is one of the only races I haven’t seen live
Nice
Alonso showed why Lulu is overrated 😌😌
Stroll is me in a F1 Game.
let SEB win  thirty minutes
This was being manipulated man
"Bottas took out 2 Red Bull cars" and now Mercedes crying like a b*tch. KARMA
Bottas: "ALLAHU AKBAR"
5:40 why does Hamilton use DRS here? Isn't that illegal?
This is when RB Lost constructor championship
6:25 uhm we need to talk about that french skills 😅🤣
This screaming commentary is so irritating.
Hamilton Fined for 2nd place podium as Sebastian Vettel DSQ
0:16 ricciardo spins
Geez F1 alone is a stunning sport. Crofty makes it ever more goosebumpy
Lewis was allowed to un-lap himself at Imola because Bottas crashed, 18 points he shouldn't have got. Then he was allowed to get 25 points after almost killing Max at Silverstone.  Then he had Bottas take out both Red Bulls at Hungary for him, and.. Still. He. Lost Could be a new slogan for his helmet 🤣
e
Karma strolled into abu dhabi taking no prisoners and showing no mercy....
1:19 very entertaining
What was the penalty for such stupidity from botas?... Should be banned for atleast one race imo😂
완전 재밌다~~
It would have been a travesty if Verstappen had lost the championship because Bottas, Hamilton's teammate, crashed into him and damaged his car in Hungary.
Another mercedes hackjob to try and cheat their way to the title
rObBeD
Hearing the commentators mentioning Schumacher just brings back memories
Max only won the championship because of someone else's mistake
O Verstappen foi o piloto mais azarado do campeonato: 1_Ímola 2_Azerbaijão 3_Silverstone  4_Hungria 5_Itália (Pit Stop) 6_Rússia (Norris deu a vitória ao Hamilton)
Karma hit back in Abu Dhabi
Bottas, what a loser!  year after year!
Karma hits the race leader and lost championship
"we race as one"
BOTTAS CRASHED ON PURPOSE SO HIS LULU TEAMMATE CAN GET IN FRONT WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT VERSTAPPEN!!!!!!!
Ocon in the lead. Alonso sees Hamilton in his mirrors. Alonso: "Oh no you don't!"
one of the many reasons this year that toto and ham and merc should have shut up immediately  no no no micheal this isnt right !! michael you need to reinstate the lap before :P :P  :P loooool
LH44 starting alone will forever be too hilarious 🤣
Mercedes fans now crying that FIA is not right. Wow. They didn’t see that coming.
Fun fact: if Alonso didn’t defend Hamilton for as long as he did Hamilton would’ve probably won and with it the championship
Bad Luck for max and checo, hope they get some luck in the future 😉
Bottas winning the Constructor's championship! Bravo!
Idiot Bottas
At 5:45 Lewis got DRS after he clearly passed Carlos before the DRS line. It likely wouldn’t have mattered but how does this happen…?
did Hamilton open his DRS at 5:45? Vettel was ahead by 1.4 sec at that point.
2:45 Schumacher could've decided the WDC right there. o_o
And they say Checo is unsportsmanlike when he had a great defense for the team when bottas took out 2 redbulls.
Muhteşem perfromance
Seb got robbed
Amazing what you can in mercs car with an illegal flexible wing
So the Mercedes tried to stop Max, at the end they failed. Bunch of losers.
Carma Abu Dabi!
FX setting on F1TV is so important
Lewis Hamilton driving alone
This would have been a win for Vettel if they didn't mess up the pit stop.
Took out opponents with your second driver! Justice came yesterday
Assassination in broad daylight 💀💀
It’s was the best season ever every race was unique , two drivers performed at their best and made rest of the field look like amateurs. FIA was consistently inconsistent. Never a major overhaul.
What if Hamilton did not start the race
bottas bowling or bottas bumpercar could be bottas billiards too.
Alonso showing why he is widely considered the most talented f1 driver for the last 15 years...at the age of 40. That guy is really amazing
4:27 Alonso
Vettel Robbed
The best race of the season y'all
Bottas is so inconsistent with his starts. Hopefully Russell will be better.  To think bottas took out red bull on purpose is ridiculous, only idiots would think so…he locked up behind a mclaren
Lol cheating Mercs trying to secure the title. Silverstone and Hungary may of given Lewis the title
Lonso cost ham tha cqhambion
Hamilton o Brasil está com você
Pinche Fórmula 1 siempre favoreciendo a los putos de Mercedes,aquí con la descalificacion después de la carrera a Vettel
If you look back on this race plus the silverstone GP, you realise how lucky Mercedes are and how Lewis is so not deserving if he wins the title.
Bottas loves skittles...
I felt sorry for the organizers and design team who put their time and heart for prepare Lewis's 100th Grand Prix win celebration
esteban's happy days 2020 sakhir 2021 hungary
Bottas and stroll never going to make that corner, 100% penalty deserved
"It's an interesting tactic by Mercedes."
Looking back, I think Antonio Giovinazzi could have won this race. He started the race on Mediums, if his team didn't put on inters during the red flag, kept his medium tyres on and started on the grid with Hamilton. He would have been leading the race. It could have been close with Ocon and Gio as long as his strategists and engineers had been optimistic and more aware. Bearing in mind that the speed difference between the Alfa Romeo and Renault, its not that much in terms of speed as both of these teams are mid to lower midfield.
This race and Verstappens 1 point will be the reason he wins or loses the championship.
Bro these mistakes from Mercedes need to be taken more seriously, this or Max’s dnf in silverstone should results in minus 20 points for the driver at fault, because you are messing up the whole title fight with them
Bottas at the start: "Hamilton is all mine"
If the Merc rear suspension was programmed to drop at a certain kmh/ how would a load test be compared to downforce when stopped....
Lewis hamilton only🤣🤣
Seeing today how bottas gives hamilton`s title here.
Vettel:This place seems so strange but familiar
"Oh no! There is a collision between Mazepin and...." This Mazepin is a fantastic driver. Week in and week out there is a collision with someone or he crashes by himself.
I feel like alpine could’ve got a double podium but Hamilton had the faster car well done alpine and Lewis
2:31 the only time the haas can fight a redbull
0:09
At 5:08 you realize how smart Lewis is by analyzing his defense then using Alonso's aggression against him and easy overtake. best driver ever
Alonso made Ocon's 1st...
Who is back here Max lost the championship because of this
Looking back, Mercedes have done a great job at taking out at least one red bull 3 times this year! Plus I thought Hamilton was supposed to be great at overtaking?? 😂😂😂
This is not a race, this is a faff
Bello
Who's here after Fernando Alonso got a podium in Qatar?
Now , Alonso back podium
If Hamilton loses 2021, it'll be because of his/merc's mistakes in Bahrain and Hungary. 50 points were waiting for him in those races!
Never really cared about Ocon but that line at 6:10 gave me goosebumps.
Why didn't Hamilton pit?
This was my first ever f1 grand prix I watched. At this time i had no idea who the drivers were and what teams they had. I didn't even know anything about the championship points nor the constructor championship.   But I enjoyed the thrill of watching people race and I didn't even know who got podium finish until now that I'm rewatching it again and now understand everything lol.
Ocon literally led the whole race and got like just 15 seconds of screen time on this video💀
This must be the best race ever in F1, so much actions and twists and turns and an underdog winning
A reverse of this is happening in Jeddah where Perez takes the two Mercs out. I am calling it.
Loved seeing Alonso vs Hamilton. That was so freaking awesome! Alonso was so ready to fight.
Ocon won a Grand Prix before Lando, Russell, Sainz. That’s crazy! And they get way more hype then Ocon
Hamilton esun tramposo porque no entra a cambiar ruedas
Be like CHAD Pierre 645ly , dropped to last, dodged the carnage, stole the fastest lap, finished P6 , mr.p6 (p5)

Schumacher vs Verstappen
Max Verstappen cannot be the F1 world champion because he is not an example for young people. If Senna were there, he would have immediately taken him back to the Monza box and would have taught him to live. After the Monza accident he did not help Hamilton and there it was understood that he is not a man, a sportsman, because a world champion must first of all be a champion of humanity in life and an image to imitate for the little ones, for the children and for the man of tomorrow. For this Hamilton true image man of the sport he still has to win, Verstappen is still small of mind to be a champion.  It would be a shame if a Max Verstappen person who does not help a colleague of his in Monza became F1 world champion ... but what is there to teach our children, sorry.
Latifi: How did george do that? Radio man: AND HOW DOES ESTABAN OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN 2021 GRAND PRIX
SUPER
Alonso es un gran piloto.
If you look closely at 4:49 when Alonso was defending against Hamilton, Hamilton tried bumping Alonso's rear wheel like he did with both Albon and Verstappen which made both of them lose control and fly off the track. Masterclass racing from Alonso and Hamilton, but Nico was indeed correct when he said Lewis dances in that grey area. If you're just watching the race then you might not notice it because it looks like regular contact, but if you compare his behavior when trying to put pressure on to pass, he's used that move more than once.
Biggest surprise here is Williams on P2
Alonso has my heart. What an absolute legend.
Best race of the decade
Mercedes, if you can't win, just hit them. Shame!
I wish Brundle wouldn't shout so much.

Mercedes needs to stop crashing into RedBull this year it’s not fair
대형사고로 참 불쌍해진 박대리와 혼자서 출발하는 해물탕이 꼴등에서 3등으로 감ㅋ
Watched this race with my mom, it was great just watching her cheer Alonso on whilst defending against Lewis.
Formula 1
Man oh man if Alonso had a faster car he would have a podium but we all know very well on which team Alonso is!!!
When Lewis didn’t go for the pits to change his tires before the restart I’m like that’s a lighting McQueen move right there
Bottas channelled his inner mazepin lol
The craziest grand prix I've ever seen
The way Alonso held Hamilton back against all odds, allowing Ocon to win is so beautiful
Mercedes master plan 1)Took both red bull out
Disgusting move by Mercedes. Anything to make golden boy Hamilton win
Bottas taking out the others looked like Bowling with F1 cars
hamilton is king legends superstar he consisten 😎😎😎
Schumacher & Senna over Hamilton
6:08 Legit goosebumps. Crofty is a legend.
The winner is: Blue team!
Wow! These are cars from Heaven!
The Vettel podium they took from us
😕😱
Sad what's come of Alonso from being Hamiltons title rival now his only worth is that of a training beacon
its a tradition to watch this highlight every month.
This would be considered the epic race of 2021 season !
Who hates Lewis again? All I I heard wass cheers with every overtake he made
Well done Fernando! Showing Lewis who is the best !! 🤣🤣🤣
Voting for the best driver of the race, I vote for Bottas.
how much did mercedes offer Bottas to take out both the red bull cars?
317
And Mazepin crashing in the pit lane.   Never disappointing...
a direct hit by a Botas missile. It may be bad, but Mercedes is the worst team.
Merc only came out in front of verstappen because bottas wiped out everyone first corner.
Legendary Mazepin
Anytime someone tries to tell you these 6 world titles prove Hamilton is the best driver in f1, maybe ever, just remind them of this fact -  He was able to start on wets while everyone else went onto dry tyres, be passed by most of the field, pit twice, and yet he still finished on the podium...and was chasing down second place.  In other words, that Mercedes is so ridiculously overpowered almost any driver in f1 could do what Hamilton has done.
Leo miles de comentarios sobre lo que hizo Bottas. Hamilton demuestra que si no tiene auto no sabe ganar, te lo demuestra Alonso solo viéndolo en como sabe retenerlo con un auto de menor nivel. El señor lo que quiere es quedar en la historia de la F1 con más títulos. Fíjense la cara de solo por haber llegado tercero. Además está lleno de Británicos la F1 están desesperados por borrar de la Historia a Schumacher, Senna y Fangio. Ahhh y no me vengan con.... "Mercedes es Alemán" La mejor manera de demostrar quién es buen piloto es teniendo todos el mismo auto. Ahí los quiero ver.
the most exciting f1 race of 2021
King Alonso😎😎
1:50 Croft rompió la cuarta PARED XDD
A real lightning McQueen that Hamilton is
The F1 announcer sounds exactly like James Corden.
Mich Schumacher surely deserves more

Mercedes probably told Bottas they would extend his contract if he took out both Red Bulls.
Hamilton - what a queen
I don't know why Hamilton starts Alone after the rain stopped, that is the weirdest start in F1
The second start is funny. Hamilton is like did everyone get taken out by Bottas?
Bottas to Alfa Romeo!
The ever-hated Hungaroring has lowkey deliverer some amazing races lately
This is why the starting grid should be inverted with the faster cars in the back. More passing and more excitement. Very anticlimactic watching the race won on the first lap then waiting two hours for the podium ceremonies
5:15 I start to cheer when crofty says: YOU CAN HEAR THE CHEERS FROM THE CROWD
Bottas made contact with both Red Bulls? Are the commentary team watching the same footage as me?
Absolutely stellar performance from Alpine excellent game strategy and nice recovery mission Lewis and I cannot be more happy for Esteban so well done for these three drivers
Honda fire Verstappen and change number
Remember that video where Lando called max in his stream and max told him to send it into turn 1? Yeah I think bottas saw that video
F1 team changes one thing FIA me no like
Rosberg comentarist? Oh yeeees.
Wow!! What a race!!!
i don not get the icons of the teams. maybe 3 i can see clearly. the other. no fu clue guys.
Wish Bottas hit Hamilton
Leider hat Vettel den 2. Platz nicht bekommen
Nico rosberg voice 😆,  Comentator
Where is martin
Alonso won ocon that race well on him
I hope Max wins the drivers championship this year, Lewis makes F1 boring because he wins to much, time to let some one else win.
Just like Renault Nico Hulkenberg was braked late in Belgian GP 2018 same also hit into back of McLaren Fernando Alonso & Sauber Charles Leclerc 😡  Penalties 20 seconds of disqualified,no following of pit stop inside 😜
Announcer hollers too much, which gets old and wears thin ...
Underrated; Nico as a commentator.
greetings from Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩
Hamilton still came in third. a shame how many people talk down on him. i have high hope for Bottas and Vertsappen as well. also feel terrible for Vettle. that disqualification was very unfortunate indeed.
Congratulations F1! 6 Million SUBS!
4:47 "oh man Bono, I didn't get him. He's still not in the wall."
This whole race was a joke 💀😂
I do not agree with the situation of the Red Bull engine because of Mercedes, the FIA must do something about it, because if the engine fails the whole team loses and Mercedes already wins
des vidéo merde fait par des merde merci F1 management qui sont des gros enculé
What a race 🏁
Imagine being in F1... Then you team with Fernando😏
bottas hit norris and norris hit verstappen, how blind can everyone be?
Lewis: Valtteri let's go bowling after the race Bottas: I want now
Lewis going from 14th to 3rd. Wow
mazepin my man need to up his game bruh
I have a weird thinking that it is just a plot by hamilton team to just break the winning jinx of max verstap
Ferrari
Imagine if LH jump start 😆
But I hate Mercedes and Hamilton
I love f1
Just realized that half functioning red bull still faster than a haas, sad haas noises
Turn 1 will be a hughlight of the sensor
Grosjean Spa 2012: takes out four cars and gets a race ban. Bottas 2021 Hungary: takes out four cars and gets a 5 place penalty but his opponents will get a 10 place penalty 🤡
Can anyone tell me why Hamilton had to stop in the beginning I’ve never watched F1 so I’m new
rumors about Valtteri leave the Merc Valtteri: call an ambulance Valltteri takes out everyone at the first corner Valtteri: but not for me
On par almost with MOTOGP's crazy Austrian GP finish
Verstappen still gaining a point with half a car, i give him credit for that
We need more speed 2022 cars are slower in future f2 cars beat f1... This is ridiculous
Ahhhh man.. I'm going to miss these cars
Vettel podium 🇩🇪💪🏼
Valtteri Bowling Ball
When I saw the crash of Bottas I cannot stop to hear the Wii sport song when you make a strike
If we can just get 2 more races like this one this year I'll be happy with this year's season.
complot en contra de max y de checo
Lewis: Bottas play your role Bottas: Yes sir
1:18
كلنا هاملتون ومرسيدس
Alonso is always better than hamilton
🥰🥰
Bottas did him a solid...too bad they dropped the ball on that restart
Vamos FERRARI
Not really an Ocon fan but I’m very happy for him
Thats amazing moves by hammy (hamilton)
i love how they are highlighting how hamilton is not a better driver but has a better car.. this is so important! props to the commentators
Wey want ti ser the race..not the letters !😠
下手なBOTのお蔭で、台無しになったレース。今シーズン出走停止にしてくれ！
When you watch highlights and think that  f1 is so exciting but then realize a full race is boring AF . Go Indy car racing !!!!
Everyone open wheel race on gta online be like:
Alguien más piensa que Bottas es el arma para sabotear a Red bull? 2 carreras seguidas sacando a sus contrincantes de la carrera. Parece juego sucio de Mercedes.
was a great race..
I think Fernando Alonso is one of the most gifted racer to drive a Formula 1 car.
Sportsmanship. Sport make people better. Fair play. Olympic spirit. Yeah...
After watching F1 in Netflix to understand racing, Esteban Ocon y'all deserves the win! Congrats 👏  and what a race! I'm literally catching my breath!
Mercedes isn’t even discrete about it anymore
Aston Martin’s Sebastian Vettel has lost his second-place finish and been disqualified from the results of the Hungarian Grand Prix after race officials were unable to take the required fuel sample from his car following the race. HAM 2nd SAI 3rd
Lewis Hamilton 💪💪
It's still a fact that Hamilton is having hard time fighting his former rival Alonso. Really a veteran.
What if Ham wins world title by 1 point. Would have been much fairer to fine VET team or whatever?
Can I join Formula 1
Whats with all the yelling? Its unendurable..
Mercedes took Pastor Maldonado tactics.
LOL Stroll is such a disaster
what they did to vettel (and im not a vettel fan) made me unsubscribe from f1 tv. f1 is going to do everything to give Hamilton the championship. im out of this bs
When is the season over?
Profite Esteban a mon avis c est sa première et dernière victoire,
Bottas did his job. I've learned to hate Mercedes.
And your cod is one cod there is no deity Worthy oF Worsh ip except Him the Entirely MerciFul 🎁❤️🥀🕌🕋🌹   lslm is a religion oF mercy that does not permit terrorism 🌹🕋🕌🥀❤️
Hamilton could drive 🚗 man u have to hand it to him the mohamed Ali of f1
i like crofty but he literally has no idea what is going on
When Americans say Indy is better than F1. Just watch this…  sit down… shut up.
Croft spoke for everyone when he thought Russell had a puncture
Bottas may be the first ever new F1 Hitman
Somebody put a muzzle on that commentator. Either that, or give him some testosterone and steroids.
See You after Summer break
New windows please
Verstappen turning in on a Haas continuing his legacy of turning in on drivers
Bon l attente se fait. Tous le monde a vu Vettel a gagner oui bon il est vainqueur pour moi. Maintenant les regles sont les regles. Il y a peut être a faire des remarques sur cette methode. En sachant pertinemment qu on s en fiche des desirs des fans donc il reste plus qu a accepté.
Absolute goosebumps at the end there. I'm not even a fan of ocon, but that commentary of "Ocon Wins the Hungarian Grand Prix!" was beautiful
Every f1 team: we put the name of the team on our spoilers or the supplier of the engine Aston Martin Mercedes and Ferrari: we dont do that here
Valteri forgot to enable flashbacks
Seb the best j
Crazy
This was a historic race.
Bottas is a very loyal second man :/
Como admiro a Fernando Alonso, para mi es lo máximo saludos desde argentina
It seems I missed something. Maybe one of the experts here can explain why did Antonio Giovinazzi pit after the crash instead of restarting with Lewis? He was already on slicks, so I don't fully understand the pitstop. What did I miss?
Great teamwork 👍
Red Bull deserve the 2021 Championship, atrocious driving by the Mercedes pair. Lewis is a sore loser, sulky and spoilt who thought he was from the ghettos of Stevenage?  Let see him in a Williams and prove he can drive. Mercedes should pay for the damage to the Red Bull cars at Hungary.
Leclerc: yeteeeeer yeteeeer. Arkadan ağlama sesleri gelir.
Wow, David Croft’s speaking voice is as fast as the cars. Slow down mate, you don’t have to keep continuously talking, you can let the action on-track speak for itself for at least a few seconds.
Amazing driving from Lewis, it’s unreal 🤯
tbh if hamilton wins the WC this year its juist luck and unfairness.... i really hate it like its going atm.... bottas probably wont get a seat in the mercedes with that action after this year
Como q verstapen voltou se danificou o carro?
Toto: BOTTAS ORDER 44  bottas: yes boss got em   "Proceeds to take out half the grid"
MercedesamgF1 are such sore loosers.
I don't now how many i watch this
The most exciting race in my opinion was when Hamilton tried many times to overtake Alonso, and that was really cool
Why didn't Ocon get a penalty when the team told him to box on the way to the grid.... its a clear breach of the radio rules.
2018 German grand prix
As gamers would say: "NERF MERCEDES ALREADY!"
Botas:Target acquired  Ham: You have your orders
Poor Seb robbed by tha MaFia again...
The stiff ghana secondly wander because router affectively bruise modulo a left lunchroom. half, cut badger
Hamilton is and always will be thee GOAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seb did an incredible race that day I feel so sad about his disqualification, but he's still my favorite
Oh the shouting…
should hamilton even be driving if he is so ill that he gets dizzy and blurred vision from long ( c ) putting himself but more importantly everybody else in danger a uk track marshal died i think that same weekend at another track when there was a crash if hamilton gets so ill he shouldn't be driving
Worse commentater in the sports history. Turned the sound off at the first corner & watched it in silence.
los coches de plumavit envuelta en papel de regalo!!
Bottas is a war machine. 😎
Hamilton got what he deserved, not a 1st place.
The heavy breathing in this comment section can propel Redbull’s wind tunnel next season 😂😂
Hamilton's reputation as the luckiest man in F1 history continues, absolutely sickening.
Taking out their rivals two races in a row, starting to look like they're doing it on purpose.
The best grand prix so far in this season 👌
of course Hami has to complain about something... otherwise, how is he gonna justify losing the title at the end of the season ?
hamilton vs sainz was golden
史上稀に見るレベルの低い1コーナーの争いだな…😞
Alonso just being amazing
Срань)_а не гонгка стала!!!
But it's weird that he had 4 pit stops and still would have won if alonso wasn't there,mercs planned that to show that there is a lot of pace in them
If there was one more lap left,he would have won this race
They should give us a 20 min extended highlights like they did with Turkey last year and Germany 2019
Has to be the dumbest sounding announcer in all of sports
🅱️inoto:You know what to do bottas   Bottas: *yes master*
Yo! They didn't highlighted the whole Alonso-Hamiltom battle.  Disappointed xd
Amazing race as usual! But I wish that there was more first victory’s. Congrats Ocon
Me: Man I really do miss Maldonado Bottas: *YEAH IM FEELING NOSTALGIC ASWELL*
Would love some more Verstappan/Schumacher battles in the future.
"Help Lewis win championship, and you keep your ride." -Toto
So happy for ocon
I'm honestly happy Mazepin crashed. He is getting what he deserves after all the awful stuff he did last year.
a half red bull car has more downforce than haas
Bottas 😂😂😂
KUTT HAMILTON KUTT APP
Exciting race unlike before.
Il devrait mettre des drones pour voir  les dépassements.
The tires are too hard.
Alonso out there reminding his kids that he's one of the OG who fought tough battles against Schuhmacher Sr.
My boy Valteri took one for the team😤😤😤👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🔥🔥🔥
My man Valteri took a bullet  for the team😤😤👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻🔥🔥🔥
Dinoco is all mine
He took out both red bulls also both McLarens
Was a nice touch having rosberg commentating
Yeay new team champion 👍🏻
Eu amo formula um, adoro assistir de vdd.
Ne yarıştı. Bottas iki redbullu da bitirdi.
Horrible commenters
Alonso, driver of the day 🤩🤩
Two races with Mercedes knock down red bull drivers and affect their performance and fia do nothing….do you have job vacancies…I wish to go in too..because your job description is just do nothing….
honda чет сдает позиции ((( капец.
Since Lando's point finishing streak is over I hope the no-Mercedes-1-2 streak continues...
i just hope that wasn't deliberate from poor valteri. not sure why lewis didn't box after red flag.
Igazi Roncsderbi volt 🤣🤦🤦🔥
Man ı feel sorry for Antonio
Viva el Nano!!
酷いな
Is there any possible way to listen this race without the announcer screaming and yelling so much you don't know what is going on?
Alonso won that race for Alpine as much as Ocon did.
Unbelievable. Mercedes needs to be kicked out of F1 for sabotaging the race.
I love hearing Rosberg commentating.
Alonso only got away with it because Lewis had everything to lose and couldnt afford another crash, which Alonso was clearly hoping for. A complete DNF for both of them woukd hv been joy to Alonso. Maybe he's auditioning for a red bull seat. Nothing wrong with that. Very glad Lewis got past, despite d daggers.
best race of this year, hands down!
Деньги на ветер
At 5:47, why does Hamilton have the DRS open? If he has no car in front of him.
mafia!!?
Hamilton got 10 second penalty for 51G crash and Bottas 5 places penalty for crashing to 6 people. Vettel disqualified for having a little less fuel than required. Just ridiculous. Also, all Hamilton fans, chill. Even if the track is difficult in overtaking and he was P14, he had by far the best car out there. Alonso proved that he is the best. He holded a Mercedes for many laps with a midfield Alpine.
Come on give Alonso a decent seat, what a waste !
When the rain falls, all bets are off in F1!
That's the beauty of F1, just collected £50 from my friend who bet with me that Vettel wouldn't  be on the podium this F1 calendar
🇦🇲🏎️🏁🏁🏁
The game is exciting. Greetings from Azerbaijan to Hungary is our friend Hungary
Bravo tu mérites 😊💪🏻
hamilton is trash
hamilton and amg are lying stealing cheaters...
So in silverstone Hamilton messed Verstappen’s race,. Now Bottas does it, and merc is leading the championship. Just stating the facts
Ocon established himself in F1 for future contacts, that is the win of the win.
Vettel must be so mad right now.
Hamilton is a beast. From last to P3 an that on a track where overtaking is difficult.
“And that’s the reason mazepin is out of this race”  There’s a lot of reasons
Bottas: Toto, how about my New contract.  Toto:..........  Bottas: Ok, hold my beer.
Those Mercedes drivers need driving lessons.
как же Никита? опять на страну повесят всех чертей🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 ладно вы с Миком Ландо Джорджем и всеми космическими пилотами будете сражаться за будущее F1 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Why didn't Hamilton pit after the red flag?
an accurate representation of f1 2021 first corner
So when is Mercedes making the move to NASCAR?  They are looking ready for it.
Poor Bottas :(
Well done sir Lewis even though everybody is against u you do ya best to show ur quality 👏
Like I don't know why bottas didn't slow down at least he tried but red flag again one in Bahrain and now Hungary
Просто Супер редики в опе идём за 8 титулом
Change the commentator. Im begging you.
What a start
Butters Days are Over! GAME OVER BUTTERS!!!
THANK YOU FERNANDO!!!
I'm so happy for ocon, what a race ❤️
After seeing my comment on the Azerbaijan GP (This will be the best race of 2021) Hungarian officials be like.. "Hold my beer"
This is the f1 we need
Verstappen va líder del campeonato... Hagamos algo para frenar eso?? Fuera 2 carreras 🤣🤣. Hamilton regalón de la F1
Bad mercedess
This is really suspicious, after Silverstone and all...
Sadly for haas and vettel
just say thank you to alonso.
dude, 12 laps of Alonso battle and you only show 2... ridiculous
Max loves the wider line off track.
Yo no se si cn el confinamiento me he aficionao tanto al simracing, q ahora no veo diferencias cn los "profesionales".... Los mismos accidentes chorras y las mismas burradas en la vida real q online 🤦. El año q viene q habrán mas luchas cuerpo a cuerpo, habrá q contratar al spoter d IRacing para q cante los "clear" o los comisarios no daran a basto cn las sanciones.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. RESPETEN LOS PARALELOS SEÑORES!!
헝가리 그랑프리(F1)
Verstappen just doesnt learn...still banging wheels with people
Mercedes are cheats. End of.
Bottas planned this,
I was afraid that Hamilton takes out Alonso just like he did with Verstappen in Silverstone. Wouldn't be a surprise.
Its crazy how experience in a midfield brand new car driven by Alonso Held off Hamilton for that long, just goes to show how far experience goes in this competition. glad Alonso is with a better team than McLaren.  IMO that was a rare display of a teammate looking out for the younger guy seeing that he hasn't finished with a  1st place podium until this point and saw the points opportunity for the team and exploited it. congrats to team alpine!
I still not accept what Mercedes did in Great Britain and Hungary
Why does Toto Wolff seem soooo desperate to win every single race?
This the new way for Mercedes to win.Bottas takes care of business,he’s leaving Mercedes anyway.
Hamilton : thank you botas, you really understand what I want. Let's do things like this until the end of the racing season
Botas accidentally bumps into Norris to get two redbull out of the race. That's Mercedes' cunning strategy to win the championship.
Mercedes 👎
Ricardo was a waste of space !
Bottas: that's it I'm sorry guys 😔 Team: that's it huh,you gotta see what have you done 😅😅
اخيرا هاملتون الصدارة
Why Bottas is not penalize for the next grand prix but Stroll is?? The crash is all on Bottas.. He sliped just like Lance.. Am I wrong??
What a crazy race
Dangggg yo Red Bull Racing just got both their cars expelliar-petronased by the Mercedes AMG F1 Team..
That's what i' m talking about, yeahhh!!!   Hey F1 no one hold more the same results, we wanna see a variety of podium
Just how much luck can one driver have? Consistently, for years... Well, at least Ocon got the win and Vettel with AM has another podium finish.
Mercedes have showed in the last 2 races that they can't beat Red Bull in a straight fight so they just plow into them on the opening lap. 😡
Respect Hamilton
I love how Mazepin STILL manages to get a crash into the highlights. Don't understand how he's managed to get a contract
Conspiracion Mercedes y FIA para sacar de la carrera a Red Bull......mas que evidente la accion ....
What an insane comeback from Hamilton
Put Bottas to a lie detector test.. ask him if he had done the same if hamilton was in front of him..
"If you can't beat them in race, hit them outta the race." ~ Mercedes strategy is paying dividends, they are back at the top.  "There are no accidents" ~ Master Oogway
They should put that restart to the Wacky Races theme 😹🤣
2:53 Verstappen attempting to cause a collision
time for crofty to retire
wow
Ratmilton 🐀 and his team 🤦🏻‍♂️!!!
Hamilton needs to go off next time, fast

Extended highlights please 🤷‍♂️
Team orders. Alonso helped Ocon, Bottas helped Hamilton......
🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺
mercedes master plan was to take out redbulls with bottas to get verstappen lose joinks
Unpopular opinion incoming! Personally I think Lando also has to take responsibility for cutting off bottas that close to the breaking zone… you have to anticipate this.
My respect to Mercedes is gone...they shouldn't want to win the championship this way.
why Russell was given information about everyone changing tires and Lewis not
qué bonito ! 😍😍😍😍
Sebastian Vettel foi desclassificado
AND THE ANNOUNCER YELLS ABOUT EVERYTHING!
Bottas completely misjudged the start of the race.
only in flippin' 'ungary sheesh
Alonso vs Hamilton feels just like Prost trying to catch Senna at Silverstone 1993.
{ "El aludtam! Mi történik?" Ich schlafen was is das? "}
I love this season, with mercedes not using their "advantage" its anyones game now, you never know who will win
poor sebastian vettel... the FIA guidelines need to change!
Well done bottas,
2021 Formula 1 Best Strategy Award presented to ...... Mercedes
Vettel rocks!!!
What a race ✌️✌️
Fantastic!!
That was the best F1 race in years!!
Another angle  Me: Mazepin got a chance to finish Top 15 today  Mazepin:
The commentator just does it for me
Bottas was bad, but Lance Stroll took out Leclerc and Ricciardo after driving onto the grass and nobody said a thing...
Max hitting Schumacher on purpose
An instant classic
One of the best races in the year.
Bottas: hmmm *sees mclaren can hit redbull* target acquired *que wii bowling theme tune* *hits both red bulls* “STRIKE”
This race had it all, heartbreak for most of the top field, non stop action to watch, incredible defensive driving and overtakes from multiple drivers, new first time winner who had to work for it, outside of a title decider I can’t think of anything else I would have wanted from an F1 race.
Tre bien, tre bon!!! Brilliant 😊😊😊
Am I the only one who questions why Lewis was made to wait for what was a lengthy amount of time for the lights out when he was clearly ready to restart the race. He was lined up alone and in my opinion  the restart was delayed to allow the other competitors to change tyres while Lewis was sat motionless. To all the haters,Lewis was cheated!
So as soon as Hamilton isn’t leading the championship the leader instantly getting bad luck haha Mercedes are doing some witchcraft
Christian Horner and Marko are racist
Hamilton: I took out a Red Bull singlehandedly Bottas: Hold my beer
FIA: what can we do to to get our man more points. I know check Seb's fuel since they had an issue with their pump. F1 is rigged guys!!
I find it hilarious that Russel finally got his Williams into the top ten (and kept it there)....but his teammate still finished ahead of him 🤣🤣🤣🤣.  *One sentence to described this race* Azerbaijan eat your heart out
Max is a beast
Alonso was absolutely insane. He´s a beast.
Breaking: Bottas has signed a 5 year deal to play in the Bowling League
Alonso like Gandalf to Hamilton: *You can not pass !*
Bottas is the best teammate of all time
so alonso held  hamilton  more or less 15 laps?
We want lewis all overtakes....pos 14 to 3 in a video...f1💗
Hamilton to Bottas: Hey uh I've got 99 wins and I wanna win one more can you help me with that? Bottas: Yeah why not
Lucky strike Alpine
I call that start 'Indianapolis of 2021'
Lol Hamilton after pit stop look into mirror. Did Bottas kick out opponents 😂
Come on Verstappen the championship has just begun!
Mercedes after Race: Congratulations bottas you did It
selamat ocon.?
Bottas: I tackle both you can run Lewis.
pokok e Alonso 🇲🇨
And then Hamilton complained about Alonso but he crashed into Verstappen at Silverstone and celebrated like it was a major victory,   verstappen would've won that race and this race.
Is Nico Rossberg commentating this one?
Verstapen is be short of lucky
E daiiiiiii ancora coinvolta la Redbull di Max....... Così Il ladro inglese ruba altri punti..... Fatalità lui non è mai coinvolto
Lewis hamilton take a bow son
Bottas channeled his inner Masa
The only time George Russell will be second place
India walo thoko like
Hamilton, Bottas and Wolfe your unsportsmanlike behaviors make me embarrassed to drive a Mercedes CLS as my daily driver, but proud to have a Honda S2000 as my weekend car. Go Honda.
ボッタスのボケナス！!
Nice highlights and all but, cannot believe they did not include Ham's overtake of Tsunoda. One of the moves of the season.
My Emotions this race and Hamilton vs Alonso: 📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉📈📉
F1 has the best Motorsport commentary end of 💯🔥🏎️.
Lewis Hamilton  the best driver in history 👍👍
I can see how well Max Verstappen can control his car even if his right side is broken 2:38 , 2:40 , 2:42 , 2:47
If you can’t beat them, crash them!!!
Mercedes the dirtiest team in F1...I expect nothing less
STRIKE!
Ξέρω γω η FIA πάει καρότσι την Mercedes. Τελείωσε το καύσιμο του Vettel και επειδή δεν είχε 1L μέσα στο αμάξι του και είχε 0,3L τον ακυρώνουν και βγαίνει 2ος το Μπάσταρδο ο Χάμιλτον. Όλα τα πρωταθλήματα τα έχει πάρει γιατί έχει το άλλο το μπασταρδακι τον Μποτας να τρακάρει τους άλλους. Ας μην αναφέρω τα καραγκιοζιλικια της Mercedes με την Racing Point.
I feel bad for Max honestly
Bro Bottas did what Lewis did to him at 2:38
bottas go skerrrrttt
どんだけクソなんだよ便通
Vettel number one
Hamilton will always be the goat
GP2 Bottas
I remember this shy guy Ocon in season of netflix F1.
Max last week : i hate british driver Lando : not this week mate
Ferrari 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
We are really looking forward to the time when Hamilton loses his prime
amazing defending from Alonso! He was so determined to stop Lewis from catching Ocon! Now that's great team work!
I would have taken out Hamilton.
not deserved
Vettel disqualified
Norris slowed down too much, catching Bottas unawares. Plane to see.
What was Mercedes thinking for not taking Lewis in for the pit stop in the beginning?
F1 is more than just a race.....  Alonso, driving for almost 20 years, was expected to hold Lew back.... But the Champ was impeccable 🔥 Only one mistake of Lew.. he should have pitted in the beginning after the hault..... 😶
from 13th to 3rd........Sir Lewis Hamilton truly is the greatest.
Unlucky for max
Mercedes, lets wipe out the opposition and make it look like accidents and get away with it.Anyone want to bet that Bottas will keep his seat.
Absolutely nobody talking about how fast Hamilton caught up to Vettle after he overtook Saint
Noooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#2 Merc takes out all the Red Bulls?? Seriously?? After last race I'm a bit over this!!
So redbull have been cheating like Ferrari with engines 🤦‍♂️ cheaters!!!
All I can say if David makes F1 much more interesting.  Watch it the race with his replacement makes me falling to sleep
What a race… excellent.. big praises to Hamilton
this is not bottas fault .....i think so.....
So max always gets away with that but not Hamilton lol
the commentary guy can never be replaced never.
hamilton was racing alone and could not win. instead he complained  and cried as usual.
Too much yelling.
Mercedes habe to been black flagged for the next race. They stolen versteppen many points!
Super ocon
THIS ANNOUNCER IS ANNOYING!!!
Alonso is the best driver in the field. By far
Wow. First time in history? A start with no other driver?
Una verguenza lo de mercedes
Dude, commentator shouts like it's the end of the world. Overkill
I think Ericson hit them
Y así es como un mclaren se va al matadero para llevarse a los dos rivales !!
As always Max will never yield but complain when no one yield to him.
Ferrari is over
Congrats❤️😊
Iiijiik non. Mmm bbiiñk
Where can i watch f1 with this commentator
Oh so mercedes has gone rouge if you can't beat them why not bump them
Please give us more Nico i am begging you
Lewis Hamilton can freakin drive, I’m impressed
Shame.
Hey you!  Yes you random person who ill never meet I truly hope you find happiness in life. Today is going to be a great day👆
The fact that Alonso defended like that with Hamilton so close all over him and didn’t manage to spin him out turn after turn and lap after lap tells me that his shunt with Max was totally preventable….
Bottas should be penalized for all the disaster that was generated by a race error, made out to the two of Red Bull and others and in the previous race Hamilton made to Verstapen, now they generated these disasters and are leaders of the championship. Has no sense! I don't understand the judges! Where is justice? There isn't. New rules are needed. Sorry, this is my opinion.
FIA　Favor　mercedes
hamilton coward
the whole time is ocon wins 1 😅
Hmmmm
O con formidable ,vetel Spectacular ,Hamilton mouse,Sainz loseer, Alonso Hero.
Lewis: anyone have a plan to beat Max?  Mercedes team: No, do your best.  Bottas:THIS IS THE GREATEST PLAAAN!!
Bottas, explain your stupidity or duplicity.
💪👍
1,03 Everyone is going to box!!! Surely that was communication from Russell's team,which we all know is not allowed during a formation lap?
You can look at this two ways. I agree Hamilton has had a fair amount of luck against Verstappen this year, Max's blown tyre ect ect but to be fair you put the car on pole and to me this is your reward you're less likely to become entangled in traffic. I'm not a Lewis fan but I'll give credit where credit is deserved
I think this weekend, we established that (a) the Hungarian crowd IS racist and (b) Thanos ISN'T racist; he snapped everyone EXCEPT Hamilton.
Best race this season
And now, just in case there's any confusion, Ocon leads and has yet to stop. Hakkinen leads and has yet to stop. Vettel also leads, but unfortunately, he's been disqualified.
YES LEWIS IS NOW LEADING THE CHAMPIONSIP AGAIN
3:12 is that RBR social media admin on the right?
Still...Hamilton is the best. 👍👍
Joking aside, Bottas almost look like a halfwit going into turn one. Stroll on the other hand, a proper halfwit.
Bien por España. Somos los mejores.
オコンおめでとう！！
Oooof
I just came here to say I dont belong here
One of the best F1 seasons cimapelicula cimapelicula cimapelicula
What an amazing race! Unfortunate that the first corner took out so many cars. It was weird seeing Hamilton race on his own after the restart :)
Since Max started finishing 1st a lot i see Mercedes has decided to do some teamwork between bottas and hamilton.
Alonso 🙌🏻🏎😎
If Bottas did indeed deliberately take out both Red Bulls,the he should have been voted driver of the day. Not for causing the incident but more for his magnificent geometric perfection. It would take a very intelligent man to perfect such an incredible series of events.
maFIA
Mercedes team needs bumper cars instead of F1 cars
Renault made the best cars
Wait, if nicholas latifi dosen't hold up the pack in the first 20 laps, Ocon and seb wouldn't be 15 seconds ahead, can we give him some praise?
Who else thinks this race is the best race since 2020 Sakhir
Being the greatest of all time takes having a teammate who's willing to sell his ambitions for money. Valtteri is a true blessing for Lewis. If I were Hamilton, I would do anything I could to keep Bottas in Mercedes.
How can we participate in this race? Does it cost to participate or any other details?
Red Bull starts season with amazing win streak, beating Mercedes. Mercedes: (in Toto's Austrian Accent) Terminate them!  This is ridiculous tho. Mercedes indirectly/directly crashing out their competitors. It's not racing it's Nascar.
Hungarian GP is always exciting! Legendary track and great atmosphere! Keep going!
Botas is Hamilton secure
Need an extended highlights video. So much goodness during this race
Hamilton:  "He moved right in front of me......that's dangerous at these speeds!!"  Lewis clips Max's car at Silverstone and Max hits the tire barriers at a 51g impact.  Oh the hypocrisy!!!🙄🙄🙄
The best race I've ever seen🏎🏎
Yet again Vestapen banging wheels on a corner this time with a Maclaren he should be disqualified or have grid reduction for next Grand Prix
Top guns 🔫 Botes.  U are the best hired assassin out there.  Hihi
the only thing that confused me is the fact Bottas got a 5 grid drop while few years ago in spa Hulkenberg 10 grid drop for that same thing.
2:46 verstappen never learns. Throwing the car into the inside line...
Last 2 races Lewis 43 points Max 2. Nothing else to be told!
Bottas had all sorts of room to get out from behind Norris, race was  rigged and crash was intentional. watch the replays...no racer has room  to move yet stays behind another driver like that...I call BS
F1 is a field where you can see many racists as angry as ever!
Bet, the point Max got this race is the Kimi point
Big Hamilton
Time to put these guys in the same car. Then we'll see who's the best driver.
I think someone used my beat without my permission!
Racing is not the only way to win
That was a whole lotta lock-ups.
FERNANDO ALONSO LEGEND!!!!!
“I’m ѕυвѕ¢яιвιηg тσ єνєяуσηє ωнσ ѕυвѕ¢яιвєѕ тσ мє αη∂ ℓιкєѕ тнιѕ ¢σммєηт”..

Hamilton makes F1 exciting
annoying commentator
Stroll de merda
Yet another Mercedes ruining the party
Bottas did it on purpose.  He was ordered to take out the competition.
Lewis. The king.  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was a crazy race.
I can`t be the only one, who wants to kick Mercedes in the nuts !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Riccardo was 2nd at the first corner and some idiot Stroll hit Ferrari and Riccardo hit him 😒😒😒
Thank you bottas
hamilton kek anjing ya selamat...
Poor Lando. Valerie had the job to crash out Max, but Lando was at the wrong place at the wrong time!
Ame of commentary ?
Actual winner still Lewis.. Who make it from 14 to 3rd..who can anyone, no other then Lewis, and what more it was in Hungarian
should Ocon join Merc team with hamiton, great hard race big time...  bottas driver so bad why he keep still join Merc...
Very strategic race for Mercedes! Shame on Toto!
When Hamilton passes Latifi, he opens DRS and car in front is not 1 sec GAP,  how this happens??? he did it twice on the Hungarian GP !!!  check it out...
Not a mention by the commentators or anyone of Hamilton turning a 33 point deficit to a 8 point lead in two races (sinister really). Irrespective of whatever you think, Hamilton will always fight tooth and nail till the very end and you will have to yank the WDC out of his hands.
Alonso THE BEST!!!!!!!! And GO MAX!!!!!!
What if Hamilton did not start the race
Botas fuvk
Team order not afair
F1 is full of victims and destroyers.
Now Verstappen touched the haas car. It could be enough to make a collision and lead to a crash. But nobody is blaming him. If Ham did it, everyone would have criticised him only because he is a black driver.
VB: Lance, it's Valtteri. Let's go bowling. LS: Ok
I don’t understand why Daniels car constantly lacks pace
Bottas is the worst driver of the grid It's a shame that such an idiot is in a F1 seat
Can anyone explain to me why Lewis all the time going first on race day? Im new to f1 !
Just realised that if Ricciardo hadn’t braked so hard into that first corner, he would have avoided being spun by Lerclerc and be ahead of Ocon. This could have been victory for him.
Shout shout shout shout shout
More wacky racing than Wacky Races. Bottas is a muppet driver. Verstappen bottling the title bid now.
Congratulations, Ocon!   Merc’s new strategy: take out your rivals in every race. Sh!theads.
A Vettel lo descalifican por no tener un litro de combustible le sacan el segundo puesto y hamilton lo saca de carrera a Max y le dan 10 segundos de penalizacion. Es Obvio que la FIA quiere que gane hamilton y mercedez le regalan todo....
Mercedes-Benz ☠️ Redbull
this race.. 🎢
Anthione would be proud of Esteban ❤️
Past two races have shown how David Croft is biased towards british drivers .
what heapen with freeline that redbul charge Fia in Hamilton overtaken Verstapen in last one race? It dosent fit in Verstapen irregular atack on  mike  in lap 14 ?
this overtaken by Verstappen in Mike is durtiest an worst than Hamilton did in penault race. However FIA even investagate. It seams we have some grease hand here.
This is definitely a race to remember for many.
Nico's voice is so annoying
This was the best dramatic race of 2021. Next race Perez crashes Lewis for a revenge.
"Bottas took out both redbull cars" Me:thats funny for some reason
Bottas TEAM ORDER
Such irritating dramatic voices these commentators got. Incredibly annoying
Russell and the rest of the he's team awesome 🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁
Hamilton smashed it , from last to 3rd , real driver
Félicitations à Mercedes, bonne consignes d'équipe 😏
Well done Ocon #1💓💓💓💓💓💓💓👍
Tf have I just seen
I miss Michael schumacher
Bottas, execute order 66 Bottas: it will be done my lord
in my opinion bottas braked too late so an accident occurred. or bottas was deliberately sacrificed to carry out the accident so that Verstappen was affected by the accident so that Hamilton could collect points to outperform Verstappen's points because his car had problems during the race due to the impact of the accident. just a viewer's opinion.
Order 66 beautifully executed. Said Toto to Bottas
Zapatillas, debe ser un gran jugador de billar.
What's Redbull say this week?  We took that back!
Indianapolis: we can have an F1 start with only 6 cars Hungaroring: hold my beer....
Magic ALONSO🇪🇦
Danny Ric was the luckiest man for about 5 seconds
It cost mercedes 10 seconds and 5 grid positions to completely botch their main rival's races and budget. Mercedes master🅱️lan at work 👏
This is the best Race in this decade
Is it the Mercedes’ way? Buxx Sxxt!!
What a race!
Sweet new winner!
HAM: Alonso is doing dangerous moves! Same HAM like a rocket misses apex at Silverstone and collides with VER... LOOOL
La F1 tiene que ser más estricto con sus sanciones. Si no estará perdiendo seguidores..
Lewis driving in NFS Carbon, “activate blocker Bottas”. Unbelievable!
Alonso with Red Bull this season would be unbelievable.
I can remember they were more battles with Alonso and Hamilton.
You have to wonder if it really necessary for David Croft to scream his way through the commentry it's one thing to be excited it's another to scream like a five year old. Spoils everything.
In the last 2 races, you lost a fan f1. Mercedes clearly should be punished for their flatout 2 destruction derbies. Red Bull and Verstappen are getting robbed, and you all clap for this. It's clear bottas moved there. It's clear Red Bull is better this year. Furthermore, it's clear that F1 works for Mercedes, and they do not want Verstappen to win.
New FIA rule: When Hamilton finish 3rd, the 2nd Will be desqualified.
ALONSO I LOVE U
Hi 👉👈🥺
Did anybody saw the CONDITION of Max's Car
Even in the pits, mazepin finds a way.
Why do they keep saying Bottas took out both RB cars? When it was Lando that took out MV, obviously caused by  Bottas's shunt and then Bottas, hit Perez.
When toto said “we are only one dnf away “I didn’t think he meant every race
George got us excited for a moment
F1 2021 is not fair. FIA only support to Hamilton and Mercedes....I think stop this race for 2022 and else... because it is not fair
Vallteri was allready signed to Alfa Romeo before this race. George Russel allready to Mercedes.
Why is it listed as This video is not listed
Ocon is the first Alonso teammate to score a win since Lewis
MA fia do it again like some years before ! did again ! give the mercs the win .... thank you MA fia for destroy f1 !
Red Bull fans, are you keep crying?)
Mercedes should be banned from F1 for like 10 years.
Magic Alonso!!!!!!
❤️ Fernando Alonso & Alpine & Esteban Ocon ❤️
When toto said “we are only one dnf away “I didn’t think he meant every race
Vettel was disqualified from this race so Hamilton moves to second and verstappen to ninth and George Russell was excited to get the williams first f1 points
mercedes have been absolutely smashing it these few races    and by smashing i mean smashing their competitors out of the entire race
La classe Esteban!!! Après tout ce que t’as traversé, n’as rien lâché, belle victoire.
Thank you so much Fernando Alonso 🤣🤣
What a race 😱😱🔥🔥🔥
Look how perfect is Bottas action to destroy both Redbull cars. ...Strange..🤔
Massive congratulations to Ocon - Alonso defends like a boss - Alpine aces Hungary 🇭🇺 Well done guys. First season too….. awesome to see new blood on the podium 👌🏻
We need extended highlight for this race. That Alonso vs Hamilton is legendary!
Botas lo hace con intención se ve clarisimo es aposta estrategia guarra de mercedes  Se ve claro que están frenando y el no frena son unos cerdos
Alonso the MVP
Alonso is back  He can fight .. he can fight 😁 Awesome job by holding shamilton
CRAZY AND DRAMATIC
I've watched this like 10 times already it feels so unreal
If you really believe Alonso was playing the team game to help Ocon win, then I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you. Alonso didn't really have an alternative than to defend aggressively for his position knowing Hamilton will be unwilling to take any risks. Assuming Alonso trusted his own ability to overtake on that track, he could have gone after Sainz who had much older tyres than him
Now this is a race, so proud of ocon and What he has achieved, and fernando alonso deserves credits for holding hamilton and giving us those battles
am scared watching this kind of sport anyway congratz to the winner
bottas just made sure that lewis stays ahead in the championship ;) .. just saying :D :D
I love it how Giovinazzi got a 10s stop go penalty for speeding in the pitlane, and Kimi gets 10s time penalty for unsafe release which effectively took out another driver. SMDH FIA, what is up with these ridiculous penalties???
What race this was though, outstanding driving from Ocon and Alonso
Why is formula 1 or sky sports not putting alonso hamilton duel video till now. Is it because their star driver lady lewis will get insulted 😂 Who wants to see a alonso hamilton duel complete 10 lap video?????
what an amazing and tough race!🔥
Dear Mercs Cut this BS. Win like a men.
F1😂🤣
Can anyone explain what happened with Russell in the pits? Why did he just overtake everyone
Why Lewis opened DRS after turn 1 when got Calros on the back ?
Bottas took one for the team, team red bull 😂
We see Hamilton starting to overtake Alonso a few times but backing off, and going from 14th to 3rd. We see Verstappen going off track limits in trying to overtake, shoving Schumacher aside whilst overtaking and going from 11th to 10th.
I'm a new F1 fan and I admit that this is the craziest race iv'e ever seen... Ocon's great win, Alonso's amazing defense, Hamilton's recovery mission, both Williams scoring, 6 DNFs and a wierd start... Wow it's just so amazing
When u realise that ocon's car was hulkenberg's old car   😑😑😑😑
Can someone more knowledgeable than me explain what happened with the screen at 3:17? Already noticed it during the race but thought it was my monitor.
The dirtiest league of all time
Vettel robbed!
We are in the ridge of rim and mount of slide differential my dear 😺on deluxe😾command😺.
Woooooow what a race. Diehard merc fan but congrats to Ocon!
Camera connect to super car
Nice one
Very nice 👍🙂
Latigoat in the point
Beautiful ❤️
Bottas made Toto happy today.
Please give us more Nico Rosberg commentary it was great
6:33 haha the little dance looks funny
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
Toto’s master plan: if your rival can’t finish, you can overtake them  (JUST A JOKE MERCEDES FANS, just a joke. dont attack me 😂)
2:44 - As usual, Verstappen is just driving into things, like there are no other cars.
Toto: "Bottas, execute order 66" Bottas: " yes, my lord"
I’m finally convinced….Hamilton is the luckiest racing driver in the history of Motorsport!!!!!
This is what I came for oh yeah
Alonso vs Hamilton is way longer than 2 laps youre showing.
Mercedes’ new strategy: Crash into others.
Be interesting to see what Lewis has to complain about
Pick an F1 bowling team: Bottas and Lance
Max will never be the same max again.
With the budget limit in place, why not let the main party responsible for the accident bear some of the repair costs of other teams？
Nice to see some different faces on the podium.
Bottas 😠
Absolutely Bonkers!!
Vettel , 0.3 kg of fuel left only 😢 disqualified
This is why Formula 1 has become trash. A car can go from 15th all the way to 2nd, but no other cars on the track can do that, and the only way to stop that guy from winning the race, is to block him. He won the last race like that, overtaking the leader of the whole race because he has a car advantage. This does not make Hamilton the best F1 driver, put any of those drivers in a Mercedes, and they will probably also win the race.
Mercedes taking competition out. Last race Lewis this time Bottas. Poor Redbull lol. Mercedes found the way to win 2021 championships with the slower drivers and slower car - Bravo!
Best races so far this mid season of 2021
Valtteri 100% strike
i really hope Mercedes will lose thev titke this season. including Hamilton
F1 is Mercedes biased, Hamilton is a waste of oxygen, Live is unfair, time to find a new sport to watch
Lewis wud have asked the team to retire his car if he was in Max's position. 🤭
Crafty old devil
Aston Martin messed up, otherwise it could've been Seb quite easily, but Ocon did a great job! Mega! That shows Seb's race craft is still tremendous!!!!
Wouldn't this be more exciting, having the fastest start in the back, it's much more entertaining to see Lewis needing to pass everyone to win instead of him just driving the open road.
At least Hamilton tries to make his takeouts look accidental, bottas just drives straight into people.
The commentator is a complete idiot. Monotonous, full-volume screaming for 2 hours.

Why Hamilton did not box after the safety car deployed?
On REPLAY 0:15 for the domino effect 4:29 Had no idea Alonso had it in him 😳🔥 🤩AWESOME RACE and I’ve only watched 5 🤣😂🤓
So happy for him... Congratulations Ocon and to my fave Sir Seb Vettel ❤️💐🍾🏆🏎️
Guilty should be brought to some kind of justice , by the looks of this even i can run an F1 car , simply drive like a lunatic and ram all competition out of the track! Simple 🤘 Edit: Mercedes really should be sponsored by Snickers because they're divas with all that hunger .
Bottas with the ultimate team play turn 1.
わざとしか思えんだろ。 どこ見てんだよ
mercedes desperate cheater move continues
Ocon wins the race but Alonso wins our hearts
One of the best races and commentatorship of the season
Only hamiltonnnnnnnnnnnnn❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
LA  FIA Y MERCEDES SON LO ANTIDEPORTIVO SIN ETICA SON UNA VERGÜENZA PARA EL DEPORTE Y EL DETERIORO DE LA F1 ACTUAL..
Fantastic “second”driver Bottas !!!!
I love Nico commenting on this!!!
Looks like we're finally having a contender against the 201# f1 season
There is no doubt that the FIA ​​greatly favors Mercedes, it seems that they already forgot to penalize Hamilton over what Max Verstappen did to him 🤔🤔
Seems like Mercedes can’t score high points without destruction lately
We need an extended race highlights for this race
1:22 when everyone disconnects from the lobby
Goosebumps! Redemption of a guy who was just about down and out. Well done Esteban Ocon, real life lesson to be learnt here 👏
alonso, hamilton drove like champs ALONSO WITH THE MASTERCALSS IN DEFENDING, HAMILTON WORKING HIS WAY ALL THE WAY UP THE TRACK TO P3.... what a duel, congrats to ocon on his win
ボッタスえぇ。。
This is one of the craziest F1 races of all time.
If you can't beat them, crash on them! British bias!!! Hoping Rosberg keeps on being one of the commentators. Tells what he sees.
*TOTO to Bottas:* Pilot Championship is now clear, Constructors' Championship is in Jeopardy, you know what to do. *BOTTAS:* Leave that to me!
When toto said “we are only one dnf away “I didn’t think he meant every race
بلد نیستم نصبش کنم تویوپ کمکم کنید لطفا چچ
What a race!! So happy for Russell getting points, Alonso is an amazing driver, Bottas should start a bowling career!
Hoy muchos tuerce botas tendrán q cerrar su enormes bocas,Alonso a demostrado ser un verdadero campeon contra Lewis y trabajando en equipo ejem....en su pista talismán y mostrando sus manos con un F1  inferior a ese mercedes ....para los del mass dumper comenalgas.....😆🥳🏎️🏎️felicidades OCon!!
As a Max fan, massive respect to Hamilton. Amazing race, without Alonso he would’ve won. I hope Max wins this season but man, Hamilton is such a consistent driver
haha hamilton was crying behind Alonso.
This has got to be the best race of the season. Ocon winning with Seb in second, fantastic defence from Alonso, Lewis climbing up the field, what a race.
Wow. What a refreshing race!
where's Aiden Jackson and Casper Akkerman?
my dad drives an astra 360
my dad told me he can race faster than any of these pusspuss'
🎳💥
Alonso! Alonso, alonso!!
@ FIA I don't know much about F1, but why don't they start with longer distances apart, so turn1's would be less chaotic or demolition derby at t1 is part of the show ?
5:38 Lewis "Hakkinens" Sainz
BOTTAS MVP
Can't get enough of these "Ferrari Vettel vs AM Vettel" memes
Mercedes ❤️ FIA " A love that will end with F1 lovers" Real Justice please!!!
Alonso has such a huge part in Ocon's win. That's great team work by the two. Mega 
Everything aside, but the stupidity of Lance on Turn 1 is mind-boggling
I never see a team which are on top only by destroying on purpose the other team. These are not accident. This is planned because Lewis and Mercedes know the other is far ahead of them. It is normally not even a match. Max verstappen is 10 levels beter than lewis
muffin
Really shows you just how OP the car of the top 2 teams compare with others, it's literally like watching a multi-class race.
Sadly the highlights cannot show the 10 lap defence from Alonso. But whoever watched knows what an amazing feat that was! Not bad for a rookie!
When toto said “we are only one dnf away “I didn’t think he meant every race
Best part of the race was Alonso defending in Hamilton. But highlight only shows 2-3 moves 🙄
Alonso es el mejor de la parrilla.
Totally a Mercedes plan. I'll refer you to Senna and Prost. Over and over.
2x RedBull DNF's vs 1 x Mercedes = Advantage Mercedes I would like 2x Mercedes DNF's vs 1x RedBull in the next few races to equalize
can anyone tell me what rule russell broke to have to give the places back as i can't find a rule to say what he did was wrong he was in the last pit box pretty sure he can just drive out as he did as the green light came on as he was coming up to the line i thought that was just lucky/quick thinking from russell to dive out ahead.thought his team would of told him to keep going and try and show it was fair racing.
Twice (2 x) too many a RedBull was given DNF due to a Mercedes.  At this stage I want Sergio to torpedo Lewis and Valteri just to see the reaction.
Loved seeing Fernando step on Lewis so hard.
Way to go bottas thats well played
What a race.
Commentators are on fire!
What a come back for hamilton💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Alonso Is the most  instinctive and warrior Driver of 21th century.  What a Massive Control and handling to keep the best car of this 7 last years...  Driver of the Day and of the Season So far without a Doubt .  Baku on Tsunoda was just   Magic Alonso 💛❤️💛❤️💛❤️  Thanks for your Return. Your illuminating Formula 1.  Bravooooooo Alipne /Renault sport F1 team  Bravo l équipe  Bravoooooo Esteban 🥂🇫🇷 Bienvenue au club des Vainqueur de F1. Bravo Fernando 💛❤️💛❤️🥂 Happy B day Fernando ,your 20 years old Now 😁😜 Un grand moment de Sport  en ces temps moroses.
this was hilarious congratulations to Ocon and Williams.
Great race
Crofty commentates as though he is watching horse racing. Infuriating. Far better enjoyed if he calmed down, stopped spewing filler talk and summarised what the viewer is seeing. Brundle is still a breath of fresh air with his light tone and conjecture
Bottas taking the role of supporting driver to the limit
Alonso nice help Ocon for Win . If not Alonso defensive long time Hamilton win
Hope Lewis gets well soon 👍🇬🇧🏆
FIA ruined a 5 star race by penalizing everything under the sun
What a race 🤤
Burh it was 1 CORNER?!?!??
What a brilliant race. Vettel disqualification a joke though.  I constantly feel like f1 rule makers are trying to stop me wanting to watch it
team radio mercedes to bottas : "execute order 66"
0:15 you dont know how frustrated i was for Danny Ric. My guy was about to make it into p2. Reminds me of Alonso Singapore 2017
WHAT A CRAZY RACE!!!!!
I love coincidences that always favor mercedes.. how convenient indeed.
lol
In typical Alonzo form anyone but Hamilton is a worthy winner for him .
LOVE Crofty's enthusiasm. Biased? Yes. But is that ok? Yes it is. For the most part anyway. Obviously he's a big fan of Lewis, but I still HUGELY prefer UK commentary to German commentary. Nico on the other hand.... just no.
Ocon is now an Icon…
이 정도면 승부 조작 의심해봐야 되는거 아니냐 ㅋㅋㅋ
Lol, comments section toxic as fk,   Go on Lewis, 8 time champion 😏
Lewis is going to win the championship for the record 8th time.  I don't think Verstappen is mature enough to win a championship yet.  Perhaps when Lewis decides to retire next year.
Safadeza eles não sabem perde tirarão vestapem da outra e agora acabarão com o carro vergonha
I'm sorry but didn't everyone in Redbull have a go at Lewis for putting his elbows out yet this time the other driver gave way wasn't that a bit dangerous shouldn't Max have the same penalty points put against him as Lewis or is this one sided
B.C. and A.D. are timemarks everyone uses. Christ is the one and only Lord and Savior. No peace without repentance and resurrection.
hahah. I think the race commentator needs a few less espresso's before the race. That is one excitable dude!
YAY MORE POINTS FOR RIKKONEN VETTEL GOT DSQ
Glad to be there!
and that was a great race
Bottas played the entire drive table
Max yet again cutting over and hitting another car. Nothing changes. No patience, no charm, no responsibility , especially when karma says hello like at Silverstone.
Lewis  at  the  speed of  Light
History is gonna be seperated in pre and post-Hungarian GP from now on. Legendary. These are the tales our children will hear of. The world will never be the same.   Aight maybe not.
Great Senna said "you must know when is the moment to be agresive"
P2 Sir Lewis, P2!!! Get in there!
@2:45 - So we just gonna ignore Verstappen brazenly turning into Schumacher, forcing the lattet to veer away in order to prevent an inevitable crash? Mind you, it's rather ironic seeing a Schumacher being so soundly "Schumacher'd" by another driver!
One of the best Grand Prix of all time?
😉
Disqualify both Mercedes Cars for the rest of the season. Absolutely despicable.
Crofty STOP SCREAMING
Que retiens tu de cette course F1 Hungary. 1.8 changement de pneus Victoire de Ocon et le geste d*accueillir Ocon après deux ans d*absence toujours en forme a 40 ans l*accident de Bottas qui change toute l*histoire de la course et enfin les points nécessaires pour la grande Victoire de Hamilton en points du World champion et vous guys quesque vous avez retenu de cette Hungary F1 Hum ? Merci pour le combat de Alonso et Hamilton j*ai attendu longtemps pour voir ça a nouveau 14 ans WOW se sont des moments qui vont s*inscrire pas dans les etoiles mais bien dans l*histoire de la F1 2021 merci pour tous ses moments. Fan Yes passion toujours.
🔥🔥🔥Как жаль стоик Феттеля забрали 2 место (((( Из-за топлива … Бред ..
when you realise Ocon has led more laps than Bottas this season.
Alonso leggenda, Bottas vattene
Go Lewis!!! You are the best.
Un record changement de pneu 1.8 WOW do they received a prize for the n'est time to change the wheels 1.8 WOW
Valteri this is james, i need you to execute plan X..for you to keep ur seat..  What a perfectly executed plan..Bottas, the Finexcutioner..
Correction Hamilton went from pole to 3rd hahahaha
Alonso le faltó detener más a Hamilton joder panas ese no debe ganar el campeonato. Ok 😤
Merc's at it again
Merc using bottas as a ram now 😂
Mercedes official global partner of F1.
*******
who is shouting all time murray walker was loud but soothing  to much pitch someone train him lol
Just a quick message for Lewis : It's easy when you are in the fastest car on the grid. We can see the CHEATING of Mercedes AMG Petronas team with the help of the FIA. You can't be that quick in a legit way. This spor has become a bad joke. Congratulations FIA.
I‘m a german newcomer👀🖤
1:19 Toto&Bottas:"Mission accomplished."
AWESOME RACE!!! *Bottas crashing dem cars*
1:19 imagine if he jump started
Craziest race of the decade so far for sure.
Unfortunately after the last 2 races you start to think badly, it can't be that they send a driver to the hospital and then in the next race they are thrown out and nothing happens ... so you start to lose respect and worse, the credibility in F1
Fun fact: 70% of the constructors have featured on the podium this season
Ham was 2 mental steps ahead @ 5:09. Brake early to use Alonso's own defensive aggression to his benefit. Masterclass
BEAST ALONSO
Mercedes = The new Schumi-team, take out your enemy at all costs...patethic
That is some of the finest driving I've ever seen. Hats off to you Alonso.
When the commertator is anti Hamilton
Imagine if Hamilton had gone off straight like Baku at the restart
Bottas bottles it again.  Again.
Did anyone else love the moment Rosberg told David Croft to stop instantly believing every single radio message Lewis Hamilton sends for once?
The commentary!!! He even spoke in tongues!! 🥰👏👏👏 GOATMENTATOR!!!
PLEASE...PLEASE.... Get rid of the "Screaming Commentator" who calls Formula One for English broadcasts.  Or at least give him a sedative. He is like an engine at "RedLine" thru the entire race. Can't even hear the engine sounds and impossible to concentrate on what you are seeing on the screen.  Do you really want this Screamer parked next to you in the stands ... SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP ... :-(
What is Hamilton's strategy? I don't get it... Congratulations to Occon!
The start was the most chaotic part.
Lewis : "let me pass !!!"  Alonso : "No , not even we were team , remember ??  f..... y......"
Engineer "Valtteri, do you remember the video we watched about the US from 2005? Well, there are more or less the same units"
This was full of drama 😂
I want more of Nico Rosberg broadcast with F1
Gggggeeeeeooooorrrrgggeee!!!!
Bottas slows down from P2, crashes into both red Bulls and its an obvious team plan by MB.
Guess who got payed "extra" this race
Indianapolis 2005: only 6 cars on the grid Hamilton: I'm about to beat another record
Mercedes - We still have to win at all cost but cant sacrifice Hamilton again, its too obvious... Meanwhile Bottas: So anyways I started shooting.
I'm honestly not here for the highlights, I'm here for the comments
Lewis and bottas can race alone. Lewis can take the championship if Mercedes planing on racing like this for the rest of the season.
That pitlane crash hurts
You are MeAsUrEd, directly by your teammate.
3 TENDENZE IN ITALIA E ANDIAMOOO
Next race Mercedes will take out 3 Red Bulls
Can anyone explain why Norris didnt get a penalty for the unsafe release? It was in the commentary and Nico Rosberg at least thought it was a sure thing
not race annymore,i hate mercedes
I guess Russell was watching some of Formula E.
I blame Nico Rosberg for this crash. If he hadn't retired and let Bottas take his seat, this crash could have been avoided. :)
Lets go verstapen
That’s what we call a toxic community
Commander Bottas execute order 66
Its starting to get really obvious mercedes...
I love how last time Hamilton accidentally touched vestapen and they moan like crazy. Vestapen this week drives straight into side of Schumacher. He is a cheat.
Hamilton didn't win because of Fernando, remember that.
This was such an awesome Grand Prix... We enjoyed every single lap...❤️ ALO vs HAM ... One of the best duels we have seen in years!
Hate this guy's voice
Mercedes smorrt
Well we can all see how the rest of the season is going to go the rest of the season will be boring i wish murray walker was still here doing the commentary but sadly he isn't with us anymore
Free lesson of driving from Fernando to Lewis for 11 laps
Congrat ocon
I want the alonso battle! That was AWESOME
Yell alittle more, will you.
This time it was REALLY Bottas' fault.
Bottas: And that's my dear children is the story how Mercedes gave me a life time contract.
First Hamilton takes out Max now Bottas does it what is their problem with Max , but this time Hamilton wasn't too blame
That's WHY F1 missed ALONSO!!!!
* crashes into 6 cars* Bottas : c'mon williams, go get those points!
carnage
Legendary...but Vettels disqualification made me sad
Mazepin crash though
this narrator sounds like he is getting paid for every molecule of oxygen he breathes
That lonely start was pathetic
Im
Thanks you il french
Stroll 🤡🤡🤡
Bottas got his contract back with that "great move"taking two rabbit 🐇 with one shoot!!
che schifo Rosberg che fa il tifo sfegatato per Hamilton..... era insopportabile in tutta la telecronaca fazioso e di parte perchè commentatore con la tv inglese....  Solo un venduto poco obiettivo....
It's amazing what Max achieved with half of the aero components missing.
Fernando Alonso: The most talented driver of the 21st century.
Que pasa ferrari has caído  muy bajo en  eficiencia 😢
Toto: Hey Valtteri, keep the Red Bulls away… Valtteri: Hold my coffee
Even if Lewis passed Alonso he still wouldn't have won ..his tires where done when he caught up to Fernando Alonso so if he passed straight away he wouldn't have passed vettel or estaban ocon...ocon won on luck and track position it's that simple... otherwise this race was Lewis's
QUE DESEPSIONANTE ES, El VER QUE TODO ESTA A FAVOR DE LOS INGLESES si todas las carreras ganan hamilton landon el grupito de estos, a la mierda no vale la pena ver f1.
Hamilton had a better Car than others, what World Champion 😅😅😅
🤯
wow i cant believe i missed this race
Bottas knows he is going to drive for Williams next Season so he is helping them already
🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Much too much screaming... Horrible!
I feel like at this point max verstappen has a hit on him
1. Race star 2. Bottas bowling in 1st corner 3. Toto sending email explaining how Max's aggressiveness cause the accident
Bumper cars!!!!
Hamilton at the restart checking his mirrors :  “Did Valtteri take out everyone?”
What in the actual.??????
Sweet sweet sweet 💕 l love it 💖 wat a nice sweet race ,Hamilton 🤘
Alonso is still a great driver! Nice teamwork with Ocon!  Stroll should be a test driver, he must thank his rich father who put him there.  Bottas thought that Norris was his ghost car for sure.  Conclusion: Hamilton best driver but also best luck in F1. Unforeseen events always turn in his favor. GG
Justice for SEB!
Some would say its quite interesting that two mercedes cars took out a red bull in two races (Hamilton French Grand Prix 2018)
I mean during this 1,5years  we've had crazy races but in my opinion this was the best one.
Alonso : Petrov mode on! 😆😉
So nice to see Alonso in the mix he's still top 3
It’s all bottas fault he did so he can stay in Mercedes
SUPER HAMILTON IS AMAZING...!!!!
Little Schumacher reminding the rest of the world that he's his father's son...
Ну ботас и клоун Они специально в Мерседес хотят Макса устранить
1:23 summarises the last 7 years of F1
It took two people for alpine to win this grand prix ,  1. Esteban Ocon - Excellent driving .  2. Alonso - Holding Hamilton for so long so that he couldn't reach Ocon .   But I am thinking , if you remove Alonso from the equation , I mean if Alonso was dnf 'ed during the start , would it be possible for Ocon to win the race ??   Sugeestions pls , no toxicity.
How do I watch this without the shouting? It’s just annoying…
Feeling sad for Vettel though,the one time he gets on podium,he is strapped from that too!
Alonso 👑
stroll race ban no?
MB and their drivers are a disgrace.  If this is what F1 is now, gone are the great days of racing.  Very sad to see this type of "driving" from that teams drivers.  They have both tarnished their reputation greatly.
Vettel diskualifikasi why?
1:24 is lewis’s past few years of winning championships in a nutshell, Which is no one to race or challenge him.
Williams master 🅱️lan
Vettel getting disqualified is a yoke!
Bottas destroying a RedBull car, no matter when you read. ⛔️
i think whit the cost cap the guilty should pay the damage.
Congrats Ocon
Lewis my hero.
not surprised every one's gotta crash out verstappen to keep him from winning. vettle/germanys only chance is to take verstappen out. that start was so b.s. every one who caused the crash should be banned for life. if i did that on the road it's attempted vehicular homicide. criminal charges need to be filed.
Cmon Red Bull, have your 2nd driver dive bomb the Mercedes cars the same way Bottas took out yours!
Alonso Magic!!❤️💛❤️
What a race!
Garbage
That f1 2021 graphics is so realistic.  I'm definitely buying this game for xbox series x.
Ease
Would love to see an aerial view of the restart. My question is: what is the procedure in a case like this. It was clear that Lewis was the only one lined up on the grid, yet it seemed like forever until they activated the restart procedure.
at this point its kind of obvious , Mercedes found a copy of destruction derby. and hamilton and bottas have been playing
Watching great race highlights like these always make my day better.
Botas doing that on purpose
With a race so close like this, so many "what if" can grow. What if Vettel pit stop was not ruined, he would undercut Ocon to P1, and not necessarily consume too much fuel attacking. Aston Martin made Seb lose the win in this race.
so, if I get it right, Vettel got a harsher penality for missing 700ml of fuel after the race, than Bottas for driving like Miley Cyrus' wrecking ball and taking out Perez and Norris, and ruining Verstappen's race.. do I get it right?
2:30 a small glims of future racing ..
How to score points as Williams : take 6 cars away so there is only 14 and bigger chance lol
bUt mUh cLiMaTe cHaNgE aMeRiCa nEeDs tO lEaD tHe cHaRgE
Bottas took both redbull cars
Why is none talking about the Schumi bump done by Verstappen. He causes unnecessary accidents, then cry when he is bumped out of the race
When Latifi is now technically the better Williams driver because he has twice as much points as Russell
Lewis: remember when I took out a Red Bull Valtteri: yes Lewis: make it double
Bottas with Mercedes 2022 Confirmed
1:19 Me in Need For Speed or Asphalt games without opponents be like.
Plot twist: Mercedes plan all along was to take the two red bulls out using bottas for the sake of the constructors.
So I have been watching this thing on repeat all-day. 👏 Impressive 👍.  Unfortunately I couldn't watch the whole race
Can someone explain me why Giovinazzi didn't start from the grid after the red flag? Didn't he already have slick tires?
How does Hamilton always do so well? He is literally always top 3
It appears as if other drivers aren't going to let Hamilton pass willingly from here on out. It sure makes for better racing
Mercedes master 🅱️lan
Williams 2019: we are worst Kubica: but i got one point Williams 2020: we are still worst Williams 2021: we have points
Congrats to Ocon!!!
Oh boy if this doesn't impress toto then what else will : Bottas still deserves the Seat in 2021
What a great season so far
Lewis coming through the pack like those dude on F1 2020 that have boost hacks.
“I’m ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˡᶦᵏᵉˢ ᵗʰᶦˢ ᶜᵒᵐᵐᵉⁿᵗ” ……,
Hamilton: toto i need a challenge Toto: no problem *Calls bottas* Bottas: hello? Toto: it's time for operation *TORPEDO MODE* Bottas: ok Danil: hey, that's my thing- Bottas: shut up *Crashes 4 drivers* Leclerc: ARE YOU SERIOUS Stroll: BRUH Others: that is a big crash *RED FLAG* Bottas: ok boss, now im going to vacation now Toto: ok
Bottas the best team driver Mercedes ever had~Totowolff~ Iftekhar Ahmed
Hearing vettel gets a dsq ruined my day 😔
Alonso from legendary era was so unlucky to choosing the wrong teams ferrari and McLaren honda..This guy it was worth more titles Hamilton drive like a real champion in every battle to the limits clean and without mistakes.
Mega drive by Esteban, Vettel, Alonso, Lewis. Happy Williams now have scored points. An intense race where all drivers up and down the field drove hard. I wonder though about the penalties awarded, Bottas (wiped out 3 cars, a McLaren and two Red Bulls), Stroll (single Ferrari and a second McLaren), but both got 5 grid drop penalties. Either the award to Bottas was very lenient or the award to Stroll is very severe.
Alonso is still a KING
Rus got no race pace
Wowww amazing mercedes petronas..hamilton well done
Now this race is *P E R F E C T*
LH44🐐
How more obvious can you make it?
Russell predicted everyone coming in, Mercedes hire Russell,.....     As a race engineer 😂🤣
Ocon doesn't win
Many people did an AMAZING job on Sunday (too many to name, actually)! Major respect to Max - driving a HORRIBLY damaged car like a true champ!!! That was INSANE, man! Poor Valtteri lost too much downforce at the front behind Lando when it mattered most, making the lockup inevitable, having braked a little too late, a little too hard. Unfortunate. BUT, both championships are VERY open now. Great season!!! Basically, nearly everyone deserved driver of the day on Sunday. What a race!!!!!! Wonderful. :-)
What a race. Hamilton gained from last to 3rd insane.
Mercedes is a fckn joke ban this team for 1 race.
Hey Its me Roman, want to go bowling with me? Bottas:
Schumacher: "I'm in the points, no one can stop me" Verstappen: "Hold my drink"
love to hear Nico. awesome... best
Toto: " Valteri, order 44!" Bottas: "Got em 1st corner, boss!"
I'm so glad of Latifi and Russel and Alonso was amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Nico's commentary was awesome
Congrats to Ocon... But wow...Hamilton is truly amazing regardless
Te das cuenta de los grandes comentaristas que tenemos en España
It was a truly enjoyable race to watch. Loved Alonso for sticking up for his teammate. Some great overtakes by Hamilton and Max squishing one point out of a demolished car. Promises to be a nice second half of the season!
Even though Lewis has better car, but salute to Fernando Alonso , the way he hold back lewis is amazing. Daniel ricciardo must be regretting now to ditch Renault  Alpine.
Seeing hamilton climb from basically the last place to podium is just insane.
Awesome race, this!
NICOLAS LATIFI: MR. SUNDAY!!!!!
Alonso needs a seat at RedBull for our entertainment
Nice job bottas keep up the work we need to get Lewis his 8th championship. (still congrats to ocon and both Williams )
BOTAS: you’re welcome..
メルセデス最悪すぎる。
What a race. Suspenseful wire to wire
Bottas by max throwing Norris against the perez thing and it was luck
F.A - The Team Man. S.P that is what M.V need from you.
It's lights out and Mercedes ruin the race again
Hamilton's luck never ends. He got 2nd after Vettel DQ.  //edit; i think FIA is looking at Ocon now.. see if Ham still can get 1st lol
F VETTEL
Hamilton 2018:"Interesting tactics by Ferrari". Red Bull 2021 could say the same about Mercedes this year...
Bottas: Mr Plow, that's my name, that name again: it's Mr Plow lol
I miss one race and this is what happens, not fair. I've been waiting for Williams to get points, they get two top 10s! Crazy
It's surprising that Ocon won a grand prix before Lando and other young competitive drivers. That's the beauty of Formula one, you never know what's gonna happen in a race. KUDOS to Alonso, undoubtedly hero of the day. Also for his brilliant comment  in the post-race interview that Hamilton's always complaining and he hold Hamilton long as possible  cause he knew it meant much to Verstappen, too.
So when Pérez parks his car right after finish in Baku its oke (no front) but Vettel gets a DSQ? Come on you fakes
Max learned you got to be on the inside to live through the bump and grind!
I hate Max more and more every race
This was the first non-redbull/mercedes win of the season. Props to Ocon and Alonso for an amazing race.
Dear F1  Please rationalise your rules and  regulations and make them more logical... Both verstappen and perez face the risk of getting grid penalties for possibly using the fourth engine, credits to hamilton and bottas for causing the collision which damaged their engines..  These rules do not make F1 look like a sport but a doctored and manipulated motor racing event...
Lewis at the restart:  “Bono the grid is gone”
Hamilton monster
Fenado did a great job. He gave the victory to Ocon. That's what work team is about, though I am a LM fan
I feel bad for ricardo because if stroll didnt hit leclerc ricardo would have been 2
One of the best races this season
do you know why i watch F1?because of my ☺️crush🥰since childhood 🙂who most probably didn't even notice i exist😐
What a great race
"BOTTAS TOOK OUT BOTH RED BULL CARS" - F1 Champion, former Mercedes driver, Nico Rosberg.   This was Toto's plan all along... The only way for Looooois to win is a RB DNF
Interesting how no Verstappen fan boys are talking about his hit on schumacher. Hahahahaha. Guess u all too ashamed or just blinded by hate
-Hamilton takes out Verstappen, 10 seconds penalty.  -Bottas takes out 2 and a half cars, 5 positions penalty.  -Vettel finishes with 0.3 lts of fuel, DISQUALIFIED.  Hamilton & Mercedes: win, win, win.  Worst part is that Hamilton truly thinks he's the best 🤦🏻‍♂️... the best at cheating at most.
do you know what Grandpas pay for to watch F1?battles like that of Alonso vs. Hamilton
Well done OCON,,,!! Without Bottas chaos in this race Max still leader Championship
i am dutch, what are the highlights?  bottas in his Gwagon zero points?
Christ almighty this commentary is AWFUL. The guy just shouts and shouts and actually takes away from the racing. GET RID!!!!
Stroll: I tried to stay in my position Also Stroll: trys to overtake outside of track
whatever people say against hamilton , but man he is a brilliant driver.
Shame on you guys for editing out Sam and Rosanna, I liked them better.
Hamilton takes out Verstappen two weeks ago and gets within points range of Verstappen. This week, Bottas, the teammate of Hamilton just happens to take out both Red Bull cars including Verstappen at the beginning of the race where Hamilton can gain even more points on the leader board. IDK, just seems a little too convenient.
I guess,  I'm the first subscriber here
VETEEEEEEL !!!
Extended highlights please
BRAVO OCON     RESPECT ALONSO
Insane how redbull wins when they don't get crashed by the cheaters
F1 season is over 🥱
im still amazed at how well max managed to drive with that massive damage, i dont think many drivers could keep that car going at that pace
Lewis: It's too dangerous in this corner to overtake with high speeds, ... ????? Did he forgot Max his 51G crash because of him last race????
I kept hoping that the drivers between Max and the front of the race would let him by, even though I knew it wouldn't really happen.
Was Bottas ordered to crash intentionally? i believe yes!!
The best race ever
Spielt hier jmd killing floor?
Why Mercedes team is always after Red Bull before it was Hamilton and Now bottas pushing their competitors off the track.
Un respect for Mercedes,  team non grato and FIA sold !!! Corrupts and suckers!!!
ki evf a pofe bufi kommentator ? :D
While Bottas's contact was horrible I think Stroll's impact and driving was worse
Alonso the unique real king from gold ages on F1 Usha Alonso!! Hamilton its just an dark clown!!!
Mercedes: rumors about replacing bottas   Bottas : i am not in danger i am the danger
Congratulations to Ocon
FIA its a joke!!  , its just funny to see how mercedes won by unsportib attitude , why FIA do not banned mercedes after be directly related to crashes and results after 2 gps????
Personally I think it's L.Norris fault for braking so sharp after over taking bottas. Common sense would tell you; okay you just over take someone let's wait a sec to brake or brake slowly but NO, LN brake quickly because he wanted the inside line of max. You could say dangerous driving by LN.  But by law It's Bottas fault, purely because he was behind the driver LN🤷🏾‍♂️ BIG BUT we must bare in mind that LN over take bottas at high speed (5gear/wet) then immediately brake! bottas(6gear/wet) reacted quickly which caused bottas wheels to lockup, and once your wheels locked up on a wet track you are a passenger and at that point you must say "hold my beer🍻"🤷🏾‍♂️.  Bottas could argued that LN brake too early on the over take but again once you are the driver behind you MUST stay at a distance to allow yourself to react to any sudden braking.  THATS IT!!! so STOP IT!!!
Hamilton: Ha, I crashed Max, nobody can better me at this. Bottas: Hold my beer!
RB was so unlucky
Poor Albon, how is he going to recreate that crash at the restart
one of the best drives of Lewis Hamilton's career and nobody seems to care
Dan vergüenza un deporte tan lindo y lo están dañado .. déjate de cosas y dale la copa a Hamilton y ya está es lo quieren .. menudo sucios
2:27 FOK smashed in front of Guenther 😂😂😂😂😂😂
So that 1.8s pit stop from red bull got no mention... 🙃
If only Stroll didn't take out himself, Leclerc and Danny Ric 😥
Bottas crashing at the start is the most bottas thing ever
Starting alone with a considerable advantage and he still managed to lose. What a jester...
BEST RACE EVER GOODBYE REDBULL
You’re still inspiring me to keep going with my channel.,!
Mission accomplished for bottas
probably the most difficult podium of Lewis' career
Great race well done to all Alonso did well holding Lewis up but the moment of the race that's being forgotten is Kimi actually helped as well. Remember Lewis had Alonso lined up for the pass and was going for it and Kimi was coming out of the pits Lewis couldn't dive inside and it sealed the win.
Bottas: No worries Shamilton, I will make sure you will get your 8th title, what ever it takes!
The one race I miss because of a delayed flight... thanks spirit
Hungary never fails to impress..
I hope Hamilton,Bottas and Mercedes leave F1 next year.
1:30 imagine if he spun 😂
1:56 lol
Hamilton not the best driver but the luckiest driver of all time.
I'm not surprised if bottas get the seat next year just because of this race.  I bet toto after this race is like new contract confirmed!
botas target is Verstappen but the bullet hit Perez
Congrats to Ocon winning! Congrats to Williams making the points! Unfortunately, Norris' streak of being in the top 10 has ended. Still, this was a great and enjoyable race in my opinion.
Bottas: eeeeeehm, he turned in on me? Toto: I'll start working on that email, MICHEAAAAAAAAL
la verdad que hoy red bull tiene mejor auto que mercedes y en las ultimas carreras mercedes apelado a la trampa para ganar, este accidente me parece intencional, una pena por el deporte
Switch Bottas and Russell after summer break
Stop yelling into your mikes commentators....
Ahora dirán que Hamilton o mercedes pago para que lloviera 🤣 O que fue culpa de Hamilton o bottas por el choque 🤣 44 siempre el mejor
It was definitely a day to be driving a blue car
Agent Bottas, execute order 44.
no1 trending
I would love to see this in the Netflix series
THIS WAS EVIDENT ... IT ALREADY EXCEEDED THE CORRUCTION LINE IN FORMULA 1, LIKE A BILLIARD GAME IT WAS ALREADY PLANNED THAT VALTERI BOTTAS WILL TAKE THE RED BULL AHEAD AND THUS GET HAMILTON'S WIDE ADVANTAGE IN THE CHAMPIONSHIP, THIS TRICK OF MERCEDES, EVEN A CHILD WOULD EVIDENCE IT AS AN ACT OF PERVERSITY BY TRAPPING TO TAKE A GREATER ADVANTAGE, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE FIA IS NOT GOING TO PUNISH THIS PRESET ACT OF MERCEDES BEFORE THE RACE TO BE IN ADVANTAGE, IT IS UNFORTUNATE TO SEE THAT THE F1 ITS HIGHEST SPHERES, IS CORRUPTED IN FAVOR OF MERCEDES.
Did anyone notice how Hamilton was weak at the podium? He hung to Ocon, couldn't raise his arm up... Or maybe another pathetical: see how weak I managed to get to the podium? See?
Yeaaaahhh
Special agent bottas
6:03 is it Nico Rosberg who was there? because the voice is similar to his
Looks like i missed a great race
Toto: Hello Valteri! We Extend the contract!
A volte credo che fanno << O LA  VA O LA SPACCA>>
so bottas got penalize for the next race, but why stroll didn't get penalize for crashing into leclerc and make him run into ric?
Just imagine Alonso in RedBull instead of Checo, what a duo could have been
下手糞ボッタス！！それでもプロか！！
Why is mercedes so petty
범퍼카 대환장파티
Vettel Letsss gooooooooooo
I disagree with the pit lane position. You can clearly see after the first few cars pitting (-6:05)  there was a huge gap compared to the rest of the field.   If Lewis had come in, he could have easily been fourth after the pitstop.
sweet hamilton !
If there has ever been a doubt about Hamilton being great driver. Nico clarified. Same car and he still has so much respect for him in his commentary.
No veis a hamilton un poco pasado de peso??
Poor Sebastian
That should be a bigger penalty for the Mercedes team! It's easier to take out your competitors than race them why not just turn f1 into dodgem cars?
Why is Crofty always shouting?
MAFIA & FIAMG
Veey Nice
Never thought Ocon would be better then Hulkenberg😂😂😂😂
What's Bowling happiness
Congrulations for boys but , theys to thank bottas for the damage
Indeed man
Lewis what a driver.Back on top.
Bottas: Can has 2022 seat? Toto: I sent you an email.
Look at Max's driving at 2:40 It is this sort of driving that we so often see from him, and why I cannot assign Lewis all of the blame for the Silverstone ding.
What's Race was this one?
There should be a screaming competition between Crofty and Arnab Goswami.  On another note, kudos to Alonso!!! What a drive. He still has his raw talent.
I’m Hamilton’s biggest fan, but it’s just sad to see Seb loosing his position :(
Crofty's commentaries give me chills.. jezz
Lewis: “At that speed it’s so dangerous man!!!” Also Lewis: “Sends it up the inside at Copse to send Verstappen into a 50G accident, and doesn’t even care”
Fernando better than hamilton
When F1 has the #1 on Trending.  Ladies and Gentlemen.  We got 'em
This guy's shouting though, in fact the commentating / shouting was a bit much, even for such an eventful race. But that's just my opinion.
Fia is just a joke at this point.
Nobody wants to race with Lewis hahaha.. Again Lewis needs Teammate help to win
Toto Wolff is the most evil guy out there!
That defence by Alonso was amazing, i knew he was going to get overtaken at some point but he did an awesome job
Why wasn't Verstappen penalized for making contact with Schumacher? That was overly aggressive driving by him! And he complained about Lewis a few weeks back.
Another Mercedes’s tactic🤣
Confratulation mr. Davide brivio .. Great job
Hi
Bottas :iam inevitable
What's missing is that Vettel protests for environmental protection in the sense of CO2 reduction ... oh wait, he earns his money with environmental pollution.  To all racing series, stop the operation immediately. Nobody needs you and the environment is unnecessarily polluted by traveling around, transporting equipment and bloids and racing.   You want to demonstrate, then start with the climate instead of taking sides for any minorities. Climate affects all people. So shut yourselves down forever.
Mercedes mais uma cagada para sua conta, pista seca deixam o Lewis com pneu de chuva tá de brincadeira.
the best race of the calendar so far... drama all the way till the end.
Alonso!! Respect
Schumacher of the Day: Bottas
How is Max not receiving a penalty?
KAMIKAZE Bottas did his part 😏🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️🏎️
Lewis's racing absolutely amazing.
2 more laps and Hamilton would've won it all.
Crazy one🔥
How is Danny being lapped ??! Jesus
Formula One is  racing-themed TV Drama. Just geek as geek can be.
Hamilton was last after restart, and he finished a few seconds behind Esteban, even though he lost a lot of time fighting through the field. It's just ridiculous how much faster they are from the rest of the field. If he changed tyres when everyone else did, this would be the most boring race this season. They really need to change something, and do it as soon as possible. If new cars doesn't do what they suppose to, F1 is in a big trouble. They will lose a lot!
Fans: Man I wish F1 will be interesting...  *F1 Became interesting*  Fans: Yes this is it!  FIA: What? you don't like it?! I hear you want more Lewis lead the championship?!
Q' poka M°!"#$%&? de la FIA, q' reinicienla carrera (casualidad) solo uno en linea "Luisa Mamilton"
This happens when you don't apply appropriate deterrents (penalties) against the bumper-car strategy from Mercedes. They just do it again and they will repeat this with the (again) way to mild penalty for BOT.
Pomogite nakopit na dvigatel plissss 🙏 😭 5469510011164267
Mercedes know what they're doing.
Und wiedermal schießt ein Mercedes seinen konkurenten ab. In dem fall zwar warscheinlich unabsichtlich aber es passiert schon viel zu oft das ich schon eine gewisse absicht darin sehe. Vorallem weil es dann auch  fast immer bottas erwischt und nicht Hamilton
Bottas took out both Red Bulls !!!!
¡Fernando Alonso, el mejor! 🇪🇸🤘🏻🔥
Its like someone said "we need to get Red bull out on the first corner"
Alonso 🔥🔥
Torpedo Valtteri.
Bottas is banned f1. We have a dream
Im a new fan to F1, please help me understand why people are emotional when williams won some points today. I'm not trying to offend people just new to the sport. From my understanding points only matter when your contending for the championship right? Sorry in advance if i offended anybody.
Valterri, this is James Great job mate
Verstappen é bem inconsequente, não é a primeira vez que ele joga o carro em cima do adversário.
0:07 I misread that lol
Highlights of this race should be just the whole race. It was just amazing!
amazing. ocon.
So no one is going to acknowledge vettels p2?
Mercedes now in the lead after taking out 3 red bulls in 2 races smh
Mercedes missile. It hits Red Bull Honda well, just like billiards😂
There is absolutely no reason to start all the cars at the same time. Did they qualify that way ? No no no they didn't. This is akin to the Tour de France and their inability to separately start groups so as to create safer, smaller groups.  It's reckless disregards for rider, driver, spectator, and property safety. At the beginning of the race, are you kidding me ? Can we call this Deformula 1 racing ? "Hey, folks, this driver has now set the record for most crash starts !!"
#1 trending
Best race of the season so far
Bottas took out both redbull😲😲
Wowwwww....Alpine...great job
Bottas did it to kick out Verstappen. He'll do anything.
Mercedes new driver names: - HammerTime - Bowling Bottas
SILVER ARROWS lol more like homing missiles
When I just watched f1 way back 2019 coz of Ferrari and I still can't believe it how Hamilton easily pass Ferrari when in fact they could fight the place for several laps had passed in season 2019💀
Best race ever
Seems like F1 is movie...only one team's got the script...
Ricciardo could have won😭
1:22 a sight that will forever be in Hungarian grand prix top 10s
Respect to Seb for supporting the minorities oppressed in Hungary
ITS  COMING  HOME   #44#
FIA shouldn't allow Bottas to drive for next two races and Mercedes should only have one car for the next two races....How on the earth 10 sec penalty will be enough....It's time for Red and Yellow Cards
Toto: “Bottas if you wipe out both red bulls I’ll give you a contract for next year” Bottas: challenge accepted
Bottas really wants to stay in the Mercedes next season I guess. Just wrecks everyone in competition with Lewis. Now that's a teammate.
How come Toto predicted the crash in the first corner in his post qualifier interview, he seems to know the outcome a day in advance. His quote all four might crash on the 1st corner & the 5th racer gasly might win.
Netflix is losing their mind thinking about what to do with all this material this season
What a race?! Alonso taught some drivers on how to defend a position while respecting the opponent's race line. Also Alpine straight cut gears sounds 👌🏼. Great race, cinematic. 🍿🍿
How
At the restart. James: you’re by far the fastest on track now
When I take my car for service/tire rotation, I wish my mechanics were this fast.
When you watch this race you realise how close Grosjean was to secure a seat at Mercedes
Huge respect goes to Fernando for keeping Hamilton away from Ocon for so long. Really great move that brought Alpine a victory. Great and intense race
Motogp > f1🤫🤡
_Bruh..._
Congratulations to Mercedes F1 team for bringing shame to Formula 1.KUDOS.
Lewis : *roars* "let me pass !!!" *roars* Alonso : "you...shall...not....Pass !!! "
So  past 2 incidents involving mercedes cars cost minimum of 35 points to redbull... F1A should look into these incidents..if it happens again their should be a race ban for mercedes...bcz this iz not the way we wanna c mercedes n redbull race
So which is better. Wiping out both red bulls and your self. Or taking out the lead red bull and continuing the race. That should be the debate here!
This was a great race. I feel for bottas tho, even his bad luck has bad luck.
Bugima Alonso...
Sebastian Vettel was wronged badly
Justice for seb
VETTEL DISQUALIFIED.....
So when will we see another French commentary for Ocon’s win?
最悪だ…
pro tips : turn off the volume so you dont have to hear Crofty scream
Deliberate take out by Bottas
5 things will be remembered from this race 1. The lap 1 crash 2. Hamilton taking the 2nd race start by himself 3.Alonso vs. Hamilton  4. Williams taking double points and scoring for the first time since Germany 2019 5.Esteban Ocon winning an F1 Grand Prix This was a legendary race and will probably go down as the best race of the year and one of the best of the last 5 years
Perez and Alpha Tauri should start targeting Hamilton
Idiots in merc and fia
So that's what a Kamikaze mission looks like. Hmmmm.....👁👄👁
What if Lewis jumped the start in the second start :D :D
Bottas mistook F1 for bowling this race.
Bottas  is a cheat hopefully is investigated or maybe learn too drive a f1 car he too verstapern out on purpose
Such bad luck for RB on lap 1! I hope they come back strong and Merc gets their own bad luck for a change.
If anyone has any doubt of the cause of the Hamilton/Verstappen crash at Silverstone, watch the reckless way Max drove in this race.
Alonso is never old he is just class behind the wheel . He was part of the Alpine win . Hopefully many to come in the future .
Oooh très bon, très bien ! Formidable. Great team work from Alonso !! What a real champ.
Can't wait for an extended highlights for this race
So Vettle disco'd for Not having enough fuel?  Why is this (sample) needed.?  To test the fuel??
what a wild race.
hamilton when fighting Alonso: "moving at such high speeds is dangerous" hamilton last race: **crashes into Verstappen with 280 kilometers an hour**
So the new Mercedes game plan for the remainder of the season is to take out everyone so that Hamilton can win?! SMH
Wingman, please leave after this season. Just leave F1.
Toto: EXECUTE ORDER 33
Rain definitely made the race super fun to watch in F1 as it happened many times in the past. Really hoping for rain in every race after this
I know Bottas is in a wheel lock , but I think it's a small ball that Bottas fired. Botas goes back to Williams and Russell comes back to Mercedes.
maFIA
So ok for vestappen to muscle MSc out of the way then!
As soon as there is a sprinkle of rain all drivers skill goes down hill.
Update: Vettel was disqualified beacuse he hadn't enough fuel in his tank, which means that Lewis Hamilton is now P2 and Carlos Sainz P3
Let’s just disqualify vettel and give some extra points on HAM as well .
Toto : Approve 1M bonus for Bottas, Great move mate😉
Bottas' car seem to be increasing in speed right before contact between 12th n 14th sec. Causing incidence in two races in a row?!!! FIA must consider implementing stricter rules, maybe 1 race suspension for the team.Lives are being risked here!!! Not only drivers but marshals too.
I have a question. Why, at every single race does Verstappens pit timer not work, why? Like can the people controlling this please wake up??!! We all sit and wait for the pit stop time and it never shows. It's been the last few races at least! Wake up please
Sainz is an amazing driver but he needs to be more bold. He is to conservative sometimes and that punishes him. He needs to take that extra step in order to be up there with Leclerc on a consistent basis
The commentator is shouting rather than commentating......most annoying and a turn off
Bottas could have done it any better knocking out both Red Bulls :-)
At least Hamilton got his Netflix screen time.
verstappen shud hav looked at his mirrors...he cud hav won
It's first time for ocon
Bottas just like:"Erickson hit me"
Bottas ....Thanos mode  Fernando... Saitama  mode Sabestien ... OPEC mode
2:00 Russell was like "Why you guys stop?"
Max will never learn : 2:50
HAM burger VS VET terinary 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Does anyone remember the crash gate of Renalt in Singapore? Stewards should support FIA to investigate very carefully
We need an extended highlights version for this.. just like hockenheim '19 and turkey '20
Keep Nico as a commentator!
Congratulations Fernando ! You are Driver Of the Day !!  Congratulations Valtteri ! You are F**k Of the Day !!
BOT hits NOR hits MAX BOT hits PER STR hits LEC hits RIC RAI hits MAZ
The commentator needs to stop screaming
“Valtteri it’s James. We need you to take out a few cars on Turn 1.”
What we learned after this race? "Valteri, ill guarantee your seat in a Merc next year, you know what you gotta do"
1:19 since I started watching Formula 1 in 1908, this is the first time I am seeing only one car starting
drive to survive will be interesting next February!
It can’t be a coincidence right? This is getting so strange the Mercedes Red Bull drama
When do I stop liking these comments?! 👍
this is where i see true color of Merc. whata 🤡
Till today people are still saying that "it's the car" 😂
🇨🇵👍
F1 2021 (Game) Bottas awareness: 99
That 3:08 pit stop from red bull looked lightning quick. It looks quicker than a 1.8
@2:45 Its verstapen and schumacher again
🔥🔥🔥
wenn man nicht im rennen gewinnen kann dann verursacht man halt Unfälle, Mercedes ist das Letzte.
2:50 so I guess Max is allowed to do this then .... ok
F1 = Fake 1
Guys just what happened there
And they disqualified seb like bruh seriously
congrats esteban but also for me the best driver there was alonso was keeping ham at bay with just pure pace until he made that mistake
6 point difference in the drivers and 10 point difference in the constructers and I have a feeling there's more drama to come.Cant wait until Belgium 🇧🇪 🏎 🏁
0:34 Valtteri it's James , Execute order 66
Return to sportive hierarchy…no more RB back studding😉
Was it planned? 🤔
String of accidents in a critical moment when Max got considerable advantage, that all benefit Lewis and ruin Red Bull. Yeah sure, all by chance.  Bottas has a slow start, then slams his car into Norris, that drives alongside Max, finally crosses the track to take out Pérez too.  5 places grid penalty isn't enough punishment. He should be out for two races and a 10 places grid penalty, as he took out Norris, Pérez and ruined Verstappen's car.
Crofty didn't say those words though...
6:27 Mdrrr le français en sueur 🥵🤣🤣😂
Secret Agent Bottas deployed. 0077
The fact that Alonso defended like that against a much faster car on much fresher tyres speaks for itself.. what a driver. Absolute legend. 👏👏👏
Sheeeesh. A F1 video on Trending.
Alonso is the goat
Mercedes strategy is looking quite strange this year, tbh.
Bruh Mercedes really trying as hard as they can so Hamilton wins
Can we just appreciate Nico’s amazing commentary again this weekend
2021 Mercedes Strategy: bumper car 🤣
I hate how lucky Hamilton is 😅 he doesn't deserve to be the winner this season with his self-centered mindset and reckless driving.
0:15 Riccardo thinking he’s the luckiest man alive… briefly..
1:21 WeRaceAsOne
the best race this season.
Mercedes, always causing wrecks, especially when Redbull is near. Did Bottas get penalized for driving like a child?
The living margaret gully transport because muscle radiographically telephone absent a threatening basketball. used, curvy noise
Mazepin always be Maze$pin
WAR MODE ON .... MERCEDES VS REDBULL .. AFTER SILVERSTONE CLASH... NOW IN HUNGARORING BOTTAS TRY TO BLOCK CHAMPIONSHIP BATTLE FOR MAX  ...
Uma das melhores corridas do Ano. Vimos Alonso, Vettel e Hamilton a mostrarem que ainda estão em dia.
Toto: "the time has come, Execute order 77"
There are 2 guys left in the world who can't pronounce Schumacher correctly, and they are the official F1 commentators.
Can't wait for Spa.
"Ocon wins the Hungarian Grand Prix"-chills...every...single...time.
The Chaos created at the start of the race was mad.
Lewis: wearing a tshirt on every occasion, the podium etc Vettel: does the same, DQ
The Hamilton fix is on with Vettel disqualification as appeal will be denied.
The FIA ​​must be ashamed of the disqualification on Vettel. 1 liter of petrol but what does it mean? 1 liter can also be included in the pumps, in the pipes and in the circuit. A meaningless regulation. And then we want when we reached the finish line by pushing the car, Prost (should be heard) and Mansel know something .. other than a liter of petrol. Shame. Give Seb back second place and give us formula one again
The ultimate conspiracy theory: "So, if I take out everyone in front of me, we win!" It might not be a provable fact but it sure looks like it.
FIA is totally supporting Hamilton by disqualifying Vettel.
Valteri Bottas is the best wingman with no doubt :)
WHAT RACE GUYS
El Ferrari frena demasiado eso se debería investigar
James: Vatteri it's James. We need to hold the RedBulls for Hamilton and Mercedes. Bottas: Say no more. *Took out both in Turn 1*
Hamilton first, Russel second in 4th lap. Looks like they are preparing for next season already.
Bottas: Trickshot!
bottas seeing that you can win by punting red bulls decides to take out 2 at once to maximize his chances
Seen from Bottas cockpit  It s really à slaughter
Hamilton envoie son rival dans le décor à 250km/h: pénalité bidon de 10 secondes Vettel finit la course avec 0,7l d'essence trop peu: DISQUALIFIE.  Scandaleux. Encore une fois toujours et toujours, une décision qui profite principalement à Hamilton. C'est Toto Wolf le président du jury?
Magic Alonso!! Congratulations Ocon and Alpine!!
Bottas was a man on a mission. He wiped out 5 cars in a blink of a red flag
Hamilton: "Here's trouble" Bottas: "And make it double"
What Stroll was thinking about by driving in the grass? This is not GT online session on a PlayStation! I am disgusted to see this driving with no fines!
Loved this race but feels bad for so many drivers at the same time, would have loved to see where lando could have taken that start. Not fair for verstappen, perez or leclerc either
Mercedes is desperate!
What a BS race, just ridiculous
Daniel was P2 for one glorious second
Bottas took out both Red Bull cars.
Looks like Bottas has been playing too much GTA
On est en Hongrie le noir est toujours tous seul. Et seul
A travesty that Vettel is disqualified. If you can take an F1 care around 70 laps with use every last drop of fuel you should get extra points, not disqualifaction. So unfair.
That was probably the best race I've ever seen at the Hungaroring, which is usually a procession.... WOW!!!!
Max should be happy Mercedes has only 2 drivers.
I demand a video of Alonso and Hamilton's battle right on my desk!
Its not only a Ocon victory ! Alonso can share the podium with him ! Amazing guys ! 🇨🇵🇪🇦
whats the point of qualy thennn ????
#1 ON TRENDING Congrats!
Toto: Bottas….execute order 66!  Bottas: it shall be done my lord.
Vintage Fernando
Fantastic double points score by Alpine. Hats off to Ocon and the mighty defense of Alonso againts Hamilton.  One of the best races i have seen.
what a win for Ocon, Renault, and the Alpine F1 Team.
0.25 speed 🤣🤣
Alonso is the man of the match
What a race it was..beautiful 🤩excellent drive by Alonso
Bottas of the day : Maldonado
If Mercedes wins this championship, we all know why they really won it. I'm not saying either of them did it on purpose, but the penalties are an absolute joke considering they ruined Red Bull's season within 2 races.
Great race I desperately want to see more racing like this in F1. if Max or lewis starts on the front row... I change channels after about 10 laps. I'm glad I stuck around for this one
mafFIA
Sergio should learn from bottas...
It's a hard moment in life to be a max Verstappen fan we thought we had a chance
Used to Love Toto and Merc. Ross Braun would be embarrassed. Alonso was awesome. Super Stoked the Williams got points. So miff that Lando didnt  get points.
Bottas did this on purpose as ordered by the Mercedes team. Open your eyes!!
im jst watching the Williams finaly have some points
The commentator needs to cut back on the sugar.
Lol amazing mazepin actually didn't cost that start havoc
It would be really upsetting if hamilton/mercedes won the title by just continuously knocking out the red bulls. What a lot of nonsense.
Toto hit the button which make bottas dive
maFIA
Sick
@Spentload I D I O T
Please somebody make "You shall not pass" meme with Alonso!
As always the same strategy! Bottas are you redy? Yes sir!
And the Drive Idiot Award agains goes to a Mercedez driver, this time Bottas.
2:52 max turns in again he never leaves space,im supporting him this season but he needs to leave much more space
Does Ocons win give vibes of buttons first win. Especially the commentary when they both win.  “JENSON BUTTON WINS”  “OCON WINS!!!”
At least Hamilton didn't win 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Sadly sebastian Vettel's disqualification makes it so much worse , mafia Don't get me wrong that was epic race !
F1 is no longer sport. This circus is run together by FIA and Mercedes.
This race will be like a sweet wine.. ❤ Well done Ocon.
The King Lewis is there yeahhhh, the GOAT
What about Perez eliminates Hamilton next 2 races (: It's worth 5s or 5 grid places penalty
Bottas took out top 4 drivers lol. Saying at Merc next year for sure now
2:52 again Verstapen hitting another car ... that was COMPLETELY uncalled for. He is brilliant, just like Senna was .. and he makes same IDIOTIC moves and mistakes - just like Senna did. He MUST grow up.
What sort of effort does it take to overtake Alonso using the fastest car on the grid? Hamilton will tell you when he gets back from the medic.
here comes the former two time champions ALONSO,such a great driver.UNBELIEVABLE!!!
Alonso holding Back Hamilton who has a car that is 2 seconds faster . It was an impossible task and he managed to stay put for 12 laps...  Well Done Alonso
Why Max Verstappen lose 😔😔😔😓😓😖
Full crowds, such a beautiful sight to see.
Had to feel for Ocon, to win with what he went through this year and last year.
Hshshss
as a Japanese Honda fan started to watch formula 1 in 2015, I was not Alonso fan before.(Off corse I know He is two times champion)  But Alonso's incredible start in sprint  quality and battle with Hamilton in Hungary made me his fan.  Sorry for my poor English. Go Alonso !!!
First race: lewis wipes out Verstappen  Second race: Bottas takes out both RB...   Third race: Russel thinking "my time has come"
1:19
1:19 last six F1 seasons in a nutshell
Fu** Mercedes
Toto: Lewis I just signed your 200 million contract, make sure we’ll get the championship. Lewis: Bottas got our back
nice crush gate.
Why can`t this guy speak with a normal voice?
I dunno if ever Sir daniel richhaaarddoo fight back
Alonso must see a therapist as he has been carrying this hate for Lewis now for a long time.
„Valteri, this is James. Execute order 66“
Fun race. Alonzo was amazing. Epic battle between he and Lewis. Shame Vettel and Aston Martin lost P2 over technical regs. Bottas and Stroll cocked everything up. Bad luck for Max; again.
Starting to hate the Mercedes,ngl
Crofty's yelling is intolerable.
Anyone else find it awesome hearing crofty talk about Schumacher racing with verstappen at 2:30? Brings back memories
Best wing man ever. And Schumacher was a cheater...
wow alpine bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Darth Toto: Valteri...the time has come. Execute Order 66.   Bottas: It will be done my lord.
I am sick of Hamilton. bye
Stiefellecker Bottas hat im Sinne von Mercedes alles richtig gemacht🥳
This is why Lewis likes Bottas as his team mate, he is a real team player.
Chaos from Mercedes Complaint child valteri botASS
How to take the gate on Hamilton away from RB. Ask Bottas to bang both RB
Congratulations 🎊 the Williams team and ocon
LA MADRE QUE LO PARIO SIN COCHE Y HACIENDO MORDER EL POLVO A JA MILTON. PUXE ASTURIES CARALLO JA JA BUENISIMO GENIO Y FIGURA.
Botas doesnt deserve that car
Secret agent Bottas
Alonso cost hammer time a lot of time
When toto said “we are only one dnf away “I didn’t think he meant every race
Is it too crazy to think there is a conspiracy from the mercedez to crash into Red bulls and take them out in any chance available?
Vettel-👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hamilton never pitted, because he would have come last, because everyone would go past him
You can’t cut Hamilton going around the outside of turn 4!!! 😧
Sad that vettel was disqualified for fuel infridement
see how no one congrats mercedes/hamilton 😂
Bottas doing everything he can to keep his seat
When you Release Sky F1 is starting to Love George Russel
Ripping !!! ❤️❤️❤️
BOTTAS DIOCANE
Great spectacle but the start of the race is an all time low once again. Bumper car racing. Some drivers really have no right to be in F1
“Vallteri, it’s James. You know what to do.”
Someone needs to take out both Mercedes cars at the next race.
I think the FIA should consider introducing the bowling ball to every race for the 2022 season. It could start from pit lane and be driven by past drivers with expertise in the skill of wiping out as many cars as possible at lights out.
We race as one. As long it's behind Lewis in the championship.
Plan A: play wingman for Lewis  Plan B: take out Verstappen  Plan C: take out Perez  Plan D: take out both Redbull drivers    Wolf: Valtteri plan D, plan D Bottas: Say no more.  After the crash  Bottas: Toto, now that I took out everyone below Lewis, did I qualify for next year Mercedes seat?
Bottas made the f**k in collision with lando
Increíble Alonso
Right strategy is key to win races (always pit before race starts).
Ocon, Vettle and Alonso were amazing. Lewis did what Lewis does, whinge like a ikkle girl and drive like a Master.
How much coffee does Crofty have before a rave? Lol I mean race but rave kinda fits as well😂
Can't believe Hamilton almost cried at the radio while battling Alonso. Like, of course he was gonna defend ? No unfair move, just a 2x WC having a personal affair and giving time to his teammate
Yikes at the screaming commentary, my ears...
Lo
This has to be one of the greatest F1 seasons ever!
This race needs extended highlights, a 6 minute video just doesn't do it justice
So Mercedes is afraid to not win the championship so the they start shooting tge rivals of the track oh come on
For a second, ricciardo thought he’d be looking at 2nd at the first turn
Vettel 😕
Alonso's performance this race was some of the best defensive driving I can remember and it really shows how his results on paper don't even come close to representing what a superb driver he is.  Also, Russell points!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What does a 10 second penalty and 5 places grid drop buys you? Answer: 38 championship points against 1.
What a moment for ocon, sharing the podium with Vettel and Hamilton.
lewis drove well
🤡🤡🤡🤡 don’t post Alonso defense against Hamilton…
Hamilton: You have to leave a space! All the time you have to leave a space!
Can someone please take the mercs out next, its getting boring
Can we appreciate Nico Rosberg as a commentator? Amazing!
So last race Lewis took out his biggest competitor. This race his teammate takes out both of their biggest competitors (as he is up for a difficult contract renegotiation)? Its starting to look a little bit funny here. Nelson Piquet Jr. kind of funny. If the championship is decided by either of those two crashes I don't think people are going to be happy.
ボッタスくそ！
Whenever I miss I race this happens I can’t believe it
00:38
TOTO Radio : "Valteri , Execute Order 66" VALTERI Radio: "Yes my Lord"
Bottas hit norris ... After that there is no control with him.. Its clearly visible in video..So he cant be responsible for red bull crash...also it happened due to climatic condition.... There r other car which happened accident too in the same lap....
Cadê o vídeo narrado em Português do Brasil?
Great race by Alpine! Congrats 🎉
nice drama valteri ..
Mercedes reminds me of Australia in cricket...to win at any cost...this will backfire a day definitely...and somebody like Smith or warner will be penalized
Valteri is best 2nd driver
Top 10 strangest races I’ve ever watched. Both starts helped
Alonso 👽
The irony in Latifi scoring more points than Russel
È una vergogna , è stato tutto preparato dal Team manager per eliminare Leclerc . Hamilton soffre di ansia da prestazione , non guarderò più la formula uno sono dei mafiosi e falsi . Tutto per i soldi
Anyone notice how exhausted Lewis looked after the race if they kept recording longer after the race he might of collapsed on stage
Alonso: Class is Permanent 💯💯
What a pe pundek race
Congratulations to Ocon and the Williams team
Hahaha I think he is lucky to win this race. Congrats Icon 👏👏👏👏👏
Championship is basically over now Mercedes have the faster car and they have all the luck
Alonso has such a huge part in Ocon's win. That's great team work by the two. Mega 🔥
Second race in a row that Mercedes cause a crash where they profit hugely from, and then getting a punishment that is way less harmful than the damage they did to Red Bull. It's like fining someone 50 euros for stealing 500 euros which they are allowed to keep.
5:13 Alonso missed a huge chance right there, he had a 30s gap and could take a 10s penalty. That's the difference between a 2 and 7 time world champion right here
What a race…I was screaming all through the finish line. Well played Ocon & congrats to Max & Ham.
mercedes driver the best drivers... same markteting strategy sale-price fixing and pointing the finger at others ... great job mb... -.-
DTS Lando :   Someone hit me in the ****ing rear, then someone hit me in the ****ing rear again!
I am still reeling,   Lance avoiding Esteban Lewis being the only one on the restart George and Nicholas being LEDGENS  Alonso's BEAUTIFUL defending Schumacher (thats it)  Vettel V Ocon Ocon winning the race.
Mercedes should pay for all the damages they caused
This Alonso rookie looks very promising. Held off Hamilton for so long, probably a future world champion?
The torpedo is back 🤣
Max's facemask looked like his car after the crash, bare minimum left.
It was clear and obvious Bottas allowed himself to drop back and then brake very late to cause that.
That race really said "No Kimi, you will not have the points,"
Poor vettel
di sicuro non avrò nessuna soddisfazione ma ora voglio vedere quali saranno i provvedimenti per i fenomeni bottas e stroll
1:21 I've never laughed so hard in my life.
Alonso still has his skills, he defended Hamilton much better than Carlos did with DRS!!
Bottas forgot which one of them was Max so he made sure to hit them both.
if u r reading this, i hope you have a day
That's how you support Lewis, nice work Valtteri That's great team work there by Mercedes 👌🏽
That shot of Hamilton taking the restart by himself is going to become iconic.
mvp goes to Alonso
So we’re ignoring the way lewis rebounded from two strategic blunders?
Everyone talks about Bottas being the best wingman.   We all know its Alonso. Lol
Jesus why did Mercedes do that
Tarnished season, shame.
As Hamilton would say - interesting tactics Mercedes, very interesting tactics.
Bottas-Torpedo mod on just naive thinks it's a coincidence
Great race, great hold up play from Alonso. Great fightback from Hamilton, Great win for Ocon
Alonso endured 12 laps to Hamilton and they have only put 1 battle.
Get rid of the screaming overexcited commentator and I might enjoy F1 again.
New Mercedes strategy take out red bull
1:19 Loneliest restart ever.
Congrats to Estaban Ocon. One of my favorites in Formula 1 and I'm glad he got a win
Bottas looking at that thumbnail: look, that's my art   😂
Ocon 👏👏👏👏👏 What a race!!!!
Well done 👍 ocon
Bottas version of racing incidents.
Ricciardo was basically in P2 until Charles hit him ugh 😣
What a race, this is the best on this season
Botas if you want to drive in 2022 take out the two Red Bulls this weekend
I don't why, i don't like hamilton at all now. A lil' bit assh*le. He do anything for winning the race. Even, take the others driver out. I like Norris, Ricciardo, and max 😂
Even the announcers know what's up 😆
ルイス・ハミルトンとフェルナンド・アロンソのバトルを見て冬木弘道と安生洋二の試合を見ている気分になりました。少しアロンソに肩入れしましたが。
Ricciardo or Leclerc could have very well won the race had it not been for Sir Lancelot
Poor vettel, teams fault
Hamilton didn’t win, let’s go lol
When you can't beat them, take them out.
Bottas !!!
where is America leadership?  who is gonna save our world?  let's asking America how to save our world?
Give Alpine a bit more top speed i tell you hamilton would have not pass Alonso, i am sure even tho hamilton is fight for the championship, that both did enjoy that amazing fight, i allways say this, rain really shows what F1 really should be, crazy, unpredictable, and down to pilot skill and strategy not car advantage, if Mercedes and Redbull didnt have such a massive advantage this kind of race would allow lower buget teams and drivers in scondary teams to shine and even win.
1 on trending
Every one busy with the race meanwhile mazepin crashed in pitstop 😂
What an amazing defense by Alonso on Lewis! Really exciting
Uzun zaman sonra heyecanlandıran müthiş bir yarış
I started watching f1 after Netflix series. Heard alot about alonso, finally experienced what a world champion he is.
Newspaper headlines will probably read this after this race. Bottas replases kyvyat as the torpedo!
With a crash like that and all but one car not racing the whole thing should have been rescheduled
We gonna pretend when Hamilton got past Ricciardo and Max, F1 didn’t add crowd noise of cheering to this video?😂
Leclerc and Max fans should get a sort of a voucher for a free therapy session 😂 Im a Leclerc fan 🥲 pain
I am one of the new Generation, I knew Alonso was great but seeing this race live I have all new respect for Alonso. This win is of  Alonso's as much it is of ocon
blockass changes his job from hold up the rest to help hamilton to crashing into the rest to help hamilton
That french gives chills @6:29
Probably the best f1 race in the last 10 years
Didn't have a chance to watch the race live, but what the F is this? 😂
Everyone comments the accident in lap 1, nobody comments the race itself, why? For these people, the accdents,that exists and perfectly natural in motor racing, mainly with these meteorlogy conditions, only the incidents and accidents were the unique interest of the 70 laps gp?  Please, that´s life beyond these idiotic conspiration´s theories!
Yooo Ham was last place to third shhsshhh respect Nando for keeping Ham that long hahahaa
why i'm happy: Ocon win why i'm sad: Vettel DSQ
How can you not hate Mercedes at this point ?
Great race from ocon vettel and alonso
Leclerc must be really disappointed
Lewis cant win on merit.
Latifi > Russel
Really was wondering why they didnt change tires before formation lap... Was it possible? Especially when LH said its dryin fast. LoL.
Race of the 2021 season?
"Have you ever played Unranked Lobbies online?" "No" "Do you want me to describe it to you?" 0:12
F1: We race as one.  Lewis: you got it!  F1: that's not what we meant.
the worst thing is having to listen to hamilton fanboys like peter windsor acting as if hamilton is just the most talented driver to ever get in a car. yeah, it's easier when your teammate wrecks out your top competition!
What an awesome race! My favourite one so far! And massive congratulations to Esteban!
Bottas: Sorry guys Mercedes: For what? Bottas: Couldn't get a Max DNF😔
Bottas, go away.
Big props to Hamilton for turning around Mercedes strategy, big props to Alonso for the amazing battle, outstanding Verstappen managing to get points in a damaged car, well done to Ocon and I am sorry dear Bottas, hopefully you get it together next year with a new team.
Yes ocon
Alonso,Man did he do well.That defence was INSANE
Man, Bottas is such a teammate
Great performance by Schumacher
Hamilton starting on the grid all on his own is meme material.
First points for George 🤍💙🤍
Forza kimi...
Bottas definitely did that on purpose
Hamilton now is illegal driver.
First i hate hamilton now im starting to hate mercedes.
Bottas and Russel finishing behind Latifi both watching Ocon win the race laughing nervously
Start looked like a regular online game of F1. So immersive!
Holy Cow Ocon
Hamilton:I’ve taken out Verstappen and Albion before. Bottas:Pathetic
Alonso done and absolutely amazing job.
Verstappen: See's he's about to be lapped by Ocon **2018 Brazil flashbacks** Oh how the turntables Ocon: Sweats Profusely
I hope this won't be remembered as the race Red Bull lost the championship. We need Max to get that 6 point lead away from Hamilton!
Happy for Seb
This makes me literally sick
So, there is no punishment or anything to bottas who caused all that first lap mayhem?? If so then yeah, anyone could intentionally lock their tires up and said that was just a racing incident.
Congrats ocon, defensive masterclass from alonso
oh no max
4:02
This Mercedes is just destroying the sports!
Everything else of this race aside, it was really nice and refreshing to have Rosberg as a commentator
Sad how Mercedes play
Mercedes offered Bottas to get Verstappen out of the race so that Hamilton get better possibilities. Mercedes is a sore loser.
Well done hungary

Vettel lost 2nd place. :(
アイツは事故に巻き込まれないんだよなぁ〜、事故らす事はあっても自分だけ被害はいつも少ない。。。　レッドブルは被害率が高過ぎる　レッドブル、アルファタウリ、ファイト〜
If Bottas would have got a better start then he might have taken out Lewis.
Mercedes cant have more luck. Kicking out red bull from the beginning 😂😂 hamilton is a bluff without that car.
Nico always delivers in the commentary.
I think fernando nearly helped win more than ocon himself or he just got revenge of hamilton of 2007
Lewis got p2 after vettle’s disqualification
Vettel deserves secend place, dont agree with that!!
welcome to Hungary
That was a well planned double take down 🤪
Renault team previous win since 2008 Japan Fuji Speedway race from Fernando Alonso
It's funny cause Hamilton complained to the team that Alonso was doing dangerous driving but we all know that Alonso is the 🐐 at defending
without Alonso's help, ocon couldn't win in Hungary GP.
this one race had more then all races last year together ^^ Red flag, Restart with 1 Car, pit stop crash, tapped Cars, Rain, Alonso vs Hamilton duell, an First time winner and DQ for Vettel cause of 0,7 Liter petrol missing in the tank ^^
This is the nest rce of the year. A battle for P1 all race long ending with Ocon getting his first Gran Prix win and Seb finishing second. A brilliant defence from Alonso. A great recovery from Lewis. Absolute chaos in the first corner. 100/10  total rating.
I no longer like Bot boy.
I think Mercedes should loose some points!! Crashed the leader of the championship twice!! And now Louis is on top! That’s just not fair und 1000% unsportsmanlike!
Brazil 2019:  Gasly, a French driver gets first F1 podium (P2) at the penultimate race of the season, gets maiden  win in the subsequent year. A Red Bull DNF A red flag Leclerc DNF Hamilton messed up strategy Giovinazzi messed up strategy Sainz gets podium after post race penalty for Hamilton  Hungary 2021:  Ocon, a French driver gets his first win in F1 at Hungary 2021 after getting a P2 in the penultimate race of 2020 (Sakhir) A Red Bull DNF A red flag Leclerc DNF Hamilton messed up strategy Giovinazzi messed up strategy Sainz gets podium after post race disqualification for Vettel
Hamilton still Rise 44 ...Super Star F1  Very soon 8x Championship...Come on Lewis ....
What
the
Toto: Valtteri, execute order 66!
After the last race,not so sure anymore of russel getting that merc seat:))
Lewis is the luckiest man alive, he knows Max is better. There is a new Sheriff in town. Absolute frustrating part of the F1 game. The best doesn't always win in this sport.
Gold medal for Bottas 👎👎👎
1-2 for Alpine
this race is literally what happen when i let my little brother play F1 2021
Problem: Red Bull is beating us in both champion ships Solution 1: Be faster Solution 2: Take them out Choices choices choices......
Nice tactics from Mercedes to get bottas to take out Hamiltons competition 😂😂😂
Even though many racers crash, esteban ocon's victory is still a surprise.. congrats esteban
Bottle wanted to play bowling
I understand why Alonso is no longer part of a top team ...
Vettel p2 in this video but he disqualified 😐😑
What a race...
Bottas team work for Lewis!
Im surprised the stewards didnt look for a reason to DQ Ocan too, I mean they depriving Hamilton of points, how on earth dare they.
F1 is so much more interesting without Hamilton or max constantly winning! Alonso's defending was as awesome! congratulations to Ocon and Vettel!
Interesting tactics Mercedes
No puedo creer que me quedé dormido en la mejor carrera
Toto: could you try taking out the red bulls valterri Bottas: Sir yes sir
Nikita muzispin😂😂😂
Germany 2018/ 19: best race in those seasons ever there's no Germany in 2020: but turkey: The best race of the season in 2020 no turkey in 2021:  Hungary 2021: the best race so far in 2021 season :O   Youtube: Cannot read property data of undefined
ALOOONSOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Alonso is extraordinary Just give him a car comparative enough He will be champion again.
It just shows that if the slower cars were faster they would probably beat the merc’s
FIA: Standing start. Lewis: Okay. Everybody Else: I don‘t feel like that. Let‘s change tires and start from the pit lane entry 😆
Really sorry for George
i commentatori che urlano sono assurdi
Alonso gave a master class for blocking with a slower car.  Simply brilliant.
Los Mercedez ocasionan choques para ganar
7:00
This is the best race this year!
Well done Lewis brilliant drive. Big well done to Mr Ocon for a brilliant win 👍🏼, also Alonso for being brilliant at a master class in defensive driving. Sorry max but it was a Maclaren that took you out yes caused by Bottas but certainly not intentional, apart from that great race guys 👍🏼👍🏼
So many crashes honestly
Even fernando hold Lewis for 10laps+, Lewis still can catch up Esteban and Sebastian like 0.1sec+ at the end. What a drive by Lewis from P13. Crazy mate! Living legend!
Toto: "Bottas, Execute order 66."
Alonso Really Deserve that
Bottas after the red flag..  "Look papa, what I did for you. Love me too now."   Toto walks away.. sad music..
Who is also confused that vettel lost the podium? 👇
"Valtteri it's Toto, the time has come... Execute order 66"😂
Bottass seat for 2022 done
Great race!!
1:10 - it's literally the movie "Cars" when Lightning McQueen stays out while everyone else is in the pits!!!! 🏎️🏎️🏎️ Lewis Hamilton is the Lightning McQueen of Formula 1
I see the tradition of "let's take out MV on the first turn" continues... They had Bottas do it this time so it's too much on the nose.
A new Torpedo was born 🚀
Is lewis now Second? Bc of vettel?
MaFIA
Can someone please explain why Williams was allowed radio comms during the formation lap?
The Establishment is back!
Stroll lol
alonso,vettel,raikkonen this guys will always be legends
wow, i didn't think it would be possible to dislike bottas more than i already did, but he took it to the next level, he should be banned for two races
Bottas' best drive of the season
I'm so excited for the meme reviews of this weekend
IT SHOULD BE ALL CAR RACERS COMMONTARY LIKE NICO ROSBERY
Mercedes destruction derby team.
01:17    Real Formula “ONE”
I love that how alonso keep lewis behind so ocon can get the win
Carlos Sainz Is 4th place in F1 Hungarian Grand Prix 🇭🇺
What's with vettel's disqualification
Is it possible to have other commentators on F1 channel, Crofty has become unbearable to listen
Hamilton at restart saw that Bottas took his job well..
Verstappen just got 1 point I’m a big fan of verstappen and Sergio Perez
Ricardo is such a gentleman
Please swop the commentator for someone who doesn’t hurt my ears!!!
Bottas finally doing his job for the team! 😉
Noooo!
RIGGED
Has anyone realised that Williams scored points
maFIA
bottas wanna win hamilton by crashing two bulls
Thats how mercedes win bottas crash every rival and Hamilton win and with Mika Hakkinen the 2nd driver crash every rival and Mika Hakkinen won thats how mercedes won in all history
Those who said Alonso was no longer in his prime, where you guys at? I told ya'll he never had a "prime". He's always at his best regardless of age or any of that bs. I'm glad he proved that to ya'll:)
Robbed vettel
1:19 this is me when i played time trial.
Max vs Msc - new gen battle  Ham vs Alo - old gen battle Which one you prefer?
merc beaten mode
Race was a mess
Imagine turning on your TV right at 1:19  😅
Imagine Hamilton winning the championship now...
bottas has been playing f1 2021 to much i see,
It's weird to see Ocon winning, just can't believe it
Perché non avete fatto vedere gli errori di Lewis e la super difesa di alonso
Is there any hope for Vettel to get the 2nd place back? Can Aston Martin file a complain and do something about it?
Alonso making sure Ocon wins!  Too bad Vettel was disqualified.
Hamilton MaFIA incoming. Alonso incredible racing, not enough credit given and what penalty does Mercedes get for destroying the race and giving Hamilton another upset , we will have to wait and see
Hahahaha that restart is the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen
Lewis got 3rd from last at a track that’s pretty much impossible to overtake just goes to show he is the goat and streaks ahead of any other driver
Yeah more biased commentary from Sky F1 as expected. If you can't beat them on track, take them out anyway in the race is Lewis and Mercedes mantra
Mercedez new strategy: If you can't pass them just take them out
bottas apologists, please stop and get your mans out of here
HAM ALO racing like it was 2007
When Bottas crash Norris, he turn the wheel to the Red Bull position to impact them. He even didn't tryied to evade the Red Bull car.
Only way mercedes can win the championship is by taking out the redbulls.
Mercedes should be banned for the next race, Bottas taking out so many cars was no accident.
Congrats Lewis 🙏👏
Bottas. Best wingman ever
Bottas best team mate. Hamilton taking advantage, hopefully Verstappen bounces back into the championship after being whiped out in the last 2 races
Bottas and Norris taking out both Redbulls like a Snowball. Bad luck
Toto: “Do it now Valteri. Both Red Bull cars are in crossfire.  Bottas aka Mercedes personal missile:  ”For the Hamilton championship win! *CRASH *BOOM  Toto: ”Superb crashing Valteri, that will be another year driving with us.”
Yo Hamilton is so broken that he starting races alone now 💀
"At that speed it's too dangerous" that fkn ham said. It seems he was 40km/h at silverstone. Well done Alonso
* crashes into 6 cars* Bottas : c'mon williams, go get those points!
Hamilton : hello there Alonso : YOU SHALL NOT PASS
Vettal
Már csak magyar versenyző kell!
I really hope George gets That Mercedes seat next year.
Am I the only one wondering how giovinazzi gets a 10 second STOP GO penalty for speeding in the pitlane a bit and kimi gets only 10 seconds for taking mazepins wheel off :/
Nothing mentioned about the Stroll banzai move ?
someone ecplain me that start with hamilton pls im legit to low iq to understand what happened
boycotting Mercedes cars for life
Best first corner EVER!!!!
What an awesome race, but can I just say: Nico Rosberg needs to be a regular on the commentary team please!
my man alonso is the mvp of the race ! man held lewis so long for his teammate ! best race in F1 so far
Why didn't Lewis change the tires with everyone at the beginning,  and then caused himself to fall behind for a full lap in the next pit stop?
Should we all thank Bottas for this incredible race?
Lando's streak ending 💔
Mercedes crashed herself into the lead into two races... Formule one does NOTHING and looses it's credability.........
First Kubica, now Latifi. But Russell is a mega talent.
Alpine CEO :Ocon not “World Champion Material” Ocon won his 1st GP .What a story 🏆🏆
If Ricciardo didn’t get spin by lance stroll he would have finished in p1 and mclaner would of broken they 112 race win
Vettel got robbed
These highlights don’t do this race justice. It was non stop action packed. An instant modern day classic.
So Verstappen pulls the same move on Schumacher that Hamilton pulled on him, the hypocrisy is hilarious. I don't have any problems anymore from Hamilton knocking him out of that race.
The commentators need better glasses or a bigger screen. “Bottas made contact with both red bulls. No he didn’t.
Amazing Lewis Hamilton !!🤩
Latifi and Alonso basically gave Ocon the win, Nicky holding up the cars so much at the first dry stint so Ocon and Vettel could make a huge gap to the others and Alonso with amazing defending. What a race!
2:25 That camera angle is totally underrated; props to the directors for showing that.
Finally, Williams got the point in this season
Alonso defend to Hamilton is very cool haha... And the best driver for team is valteri bottas hahaha
bottas and stroll with clasyy F1 video game dive bombs, lights out!
When Vettel collides whit Occon they sanction him witt 5 points and Botas only 2, the FIA kills my passion for F1 and its favoritism to Hamilton and Mercedes Benz in their championships and more...
0:14 I got a heart attack
More Merc cheating, they should be banned!
Still waiting for a penalty for Bottas, taking out 2,5 cars has to yield something? Right. But Bottas contract might be sealed now. 😂
I feel sorry for vettel now
Hamilton who?
I am RB supporter. Definitely luck is always on Lewis' side but he always recovers in the most difficult situations. He is one of the greatest of all time.  Supporting someone else doesn't mean you need to hate him.  The booing is so insulting and says a lot about those people.
Vettel disqualified😢😢😢😢😢
Toto to Bottas  Valtteri, it's Toto Execute order 66
Hmmmm what coincidence botass took both red bulls out right away
Oh so max hits Schumacher and it’s ok right ? 🖕🏻
Why isn't this a racing incident??? First lap... First corner and it was wet...
Hamilton Vs everyone lol, 1 v 20 they just don't want him to win anymore.
bottas: cheers for the new contract mate
and its lights out and away we go and bottas gives hamilton the championship lead!
Croft niech nauczy się wymowy niektórych imion,nazwisk i nazw. A tak na prawdę - dziękujemy panie Bottas za zrobienie nam widzom tak świetnego widowiska.
Vettel deserved the 2nd place podium. You robbed him!
The chain reaction with the red bulls getting hit at the start had hilarious timing
Congrats Esteban Ocon! A fairy tale story for him :D
This race proves without fast car and clean air Hamilton isn't skillful enough to win the race.. Even when Alonso was defending, Hamilton was complaining to get benefit.. Poor guy🤣🤣
Hamilton the Greatest of all Time! 💯
FIA gonna make sure Mercedes wins again.
It was 1996-2020 the time we waited for a Frenchman to win a gp. Now we only waited a year. It goes to show we have a brilliant age of drivers
"Valtteri, its james"
I’d swap the Lewis vs Max championship to watch Lewis vs Alonso. That was fire and Alonso did better than any other driver this season 🔥
Guys this is an awesome race but so is my next rc build. Promise.Cheers!
Alpine really need to get disqualified, Alonsos car is too wide which is not ok with the regulations
Only like this Hamilton is champion this year it's a 🤬💩
I'm done with F1. This is ridiculous how much Merc is being favoured by FIA
Mad props to Alonso for defending against a team like Mercedes and a Driver like Hamilton with a underpowered car !  If he had let Lewis pass it could have been a win for Mercedes
I like the rest of the drivers strategy when Hamilton kept Racing
vettel in second ahhhh what a drama in this race !
Hmm that's why Lewis Hamilton should/would get his "eight". He's just a lion. Fight from the back. 👍🏼 (Sorry Verstappen)
💯Toto gave Bottas the green light to sacrifice his race and sabotage the closest competition.
russell got points !!!! well done esteban!!!
also Bottas...starting 5 places further back next time..... Rest of the field...: "ohhhh NOOO...!!!" Spa hairpin la source......."i'm waiting"......
Man so sad that Aston messed Sebs podium up (they couldve told him about the fuel and he couldve gone slower to save fuel), but im happy for Carlos and the Williams guys at least
Max fans are all on suicide  watch today  ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
bottas bowling club
So many blood pumping battle moments! Verstappen vs Shumacher, Alonso vs Hamilton! WOOW!!
I mean is it that simple to win some points ?!  I say let Perez take out Hamilton and Bottas then let Verstappen win the race and it puts him back in 1st!  THE RULES ARE TRASH....
Who is here after vettel got disqualified ffs
The one time Russell scores points and of course Latifi gets more LOL
If this doesn't push Mercedes to renew Bottass' contract, nothing will 😂
1 point for the spice boys. 😎 happy days
Newsflash....: Bottas accepts new job.....CEO of marketleader "demoliton man"......starting....yesterday.....:-) side effects....big bonus pay out from mercedes....plus generous pensionplan.....:-)
And people say that f1 2021 unranked is unrealistic.
And now maby vettel gets disqualification for having to Little fuel remaning in the car. According Fia they had only 0.3 liters left in the car. But according to ottmar they hade 1.74 left in the car. IF vettel gets that penalty then Hamilton gets second place. And this dont show how much Mercedes owns fia?
Bottas start line so slow because of the track and is making all go away to out or DNF
Was watching live and my brain just went "Valtteri, it's James" as that crash happened LOL
Please get rid of that commentator.
LH is such a sore loser
I dont know why it's funny that Hamilton started without competition, he already raced without competition last year
It’s just so disappointing because lando was going to be into p3
Nobody celebrates with Hamilton in the podium, nobody threw the champagne with him
Nico Rosberg : Bottas took out both Redbull drivers.
Amazing Alonso
Are we just going to ignore the fact that RedBull just pulled a 1.8s pitstop on Verstappen
Great race! Incredible recovery drive from Lewis! Starting from the pitlane would still have put him last, since he'd have had to let everyone by to avoid an unsafe release. Only Alonso, showing all his skill, saved Ocon from Lewis. Atmosphere at the circuit was amazing....!
Amazing teamwork between Alonso and Ocon
01:29 i have heard this before....oh yeah from cars
Alonso is by far the best F1 driver on the grid. Even with a faster car it took 5-6 laps of hard racing for Hamilton to get by him. Put Alonso in hamilton’s car and he would also have seven championships.
Magic ALONSO!
Alonso is like the real hero of this race
so emotional to hear the anchor says ''Schumacher stays ahead of the Red Bull''! Though it only stays for a while.
2 pilots were taken outby 2 contacts by the same pilot, it is an offense only 5 penalty positions
idk why but i feel like esteban will be the jenson button of this generation. probably 1 title, a surprise win in hungary, ect
next race, crash more cars..
I hate u mercedes
MERCEDES GAME PLAN: - Take out your opponents (Red Bull) every race.
congratulations George for driving the Mercedes car in 2022
It's nice to see someone other than Hamilton or verstappen winning
Well done Hamilton for getting the bodium from last
Bottas, no breaking, it's ok...
What an awesome team player this Bottas
Give Lewis other fews laps..he will win Hungarian for sure..he really amazing from 14 to be 3 👏👏👏
I want Hamilton too win
Give back the podium to Seb!
If Hamilton didn't sabotage the  Red Bulls in Quali Max would have won.
Botha’s trying so hard to secure a drive at Merc for next year. If it’s not by a win then take out the top competing drivers. He got away with that penalty too. He should be getting 10 place grid penalty to take him out of the points positions. If he can fight back to get points then he can have them.
I'm very proud of George, surely Claire is too.👏😭💖 I was so moved to see George crying in his post-race interview.😭💖 You can feel the relief of all these years fighting hard trying to get some point and finally, the whole team did it! And with its 2 drivers!.💪😃💪 *CONGRATS WILLIAMS* , and *CONGRATS* to *George and Nicholas.* *I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU, GUYS!!!* 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Unpopolar opinion:Alonso driver of thr day and Vettel deserved the win
Mercedes should sign a new contract with Bottas, because he took 2 Redbulls out in one shot & make them got 1 point in total at this race.
At the first lap, I thought this was Demolition 1 Derby
XRP to the moon
Pertahanan yang luar biasa alonso..luar biasa.
If this race doesn't win race of the year, it must be a top 5
Alonso 3 master class
f1 is so fixed  looser hamilton
We want to know the number of dislikes 🤣 Vettel disqualified for Lulu
Hanno fatto di tutto per tagliare fuori la Red bull, non è giusto che non prendano provvedimenti Seri contro Mercedes
Mercedes sabotage red bull again!
ALONSO🧙‍♂️🧙‍♂️🧙‍♂️>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HAMILTON
it was 2007 all over again.. wow Alonso still got it! i fkn loved everything in this race but Lewis v Alonso was mega
And now it's a shame that Vettel lost his second place, just because he hadn't enough fuel left
Poor Vettel. I just wish that Alonso was on podium.
That was amazing race
"Interesting tactics"                    - Lewis Hamilton, 2018                    - Also every non Merc fan, 2021
That restart was like "I am the last man standing"... 😂 Winner of the F1 Best Meme Award 2021, for sure.😂😂😂 Lewis would have thought... *Valtteri took everyone out of race?* 😂😂😂
Toto : "Switch to C, switch to C" Bottas : "what C"? Toto : "No Mer C, no mercy"
What a race🔥
What a race. Happy for Esteban and so pleased to see Sebastian up there.
Na bravo!!!! Das sind die HIGHLIGHTS !!! Hamilton schiesst Verstapen ab und bekommt lächerliche Strafe damit er gewinnen kann, Botas schiesst (soviel ich gesehen habe ohne zu bremsen!!!!) drei Autos ab, davon zufällig beide RedBulls und bekommt lächerliche Strafe..... Am Samstag haben die Mercedes die RedBulls ausgebremst und keine Strafe bekommen!!!!!!! Ich glaube Raikkonen hat stop and go Strafe wegen gefährlichem Rausfahren bekommen und da hat er niemanden abgeschossen!!! Und Hamilton????? Was alles tut die FIA um Mercedes zum weiteren Titel zu helfen ????? Vettel hat FAIR gekämpft also warum nicht mildere Strafe? A ja da geht um Hamilton und Mercedes Punkte in der WM !!!!!!!!!! Formel 1 wird unsportlich uninteressant und ekelhaft !!!!!!!
Here it can be shown that max takes dangerous overtaking being too pushy against schumi
Hamilton really fire from bottom to third
Seb got dsq 😭
As a new F1 fan who hadn't seen Alonso in action... Today I became an Alonso fan as well.
Hamilton for the title. Mercedes for constructors.
look at the heavy penalties given out in this race(Kimi against MazeSpin e.g), I know it's long over but that 10-second penalty of Hamilton was certainly not enough.
This race will go down as one of those memorable GPs for it's "No one could have predicted that". Hamilton alone at the start was like a handicap system.
Ham can win but Alonso just hold Ham so hard, if Ham pass Alonso faster
The new way for Mercedes to outmatched their greatest rivals Redbull is to play bumper cars in F1. First Hamilton with Verstappen and then Bottas with Perez. It would have crushed me him Hamilton won this won too. Congratulations to a very worthy Esteban and Alonso( the guy is 40 years old!).
Bottas was a man on a mission yesterday 🤣😂🤣
Nice job Bottas!!!!  You deserve a seat at Mercedes for as long as you want
Botas curang lu..🤣🤣
The most entertaining race by far this season🙌🏻🙌🏼🙌🏽🙌🏾🙌🏿
So we got the next generation of the Topedo *Topedo2*: Valtari Battos
Alonso is the knight who defended the Hungarian grand prix from Hamilton.... Knighthood needs to consider who gets that title...
What a performance from Alonso, the amount of time he fenced off Lewis, that kept Lewis from getting 1st. 👏🏼
Finally a race where hamilton didnt win
Does Nico Rosberg comment?
Eagle: I can't fly, my wings hurt Red Bull idiots: Merc and Lewis are the reason why
Hamilton showed Who is the boss; overtook 12 cars, from last place went to 3. place, in hard overtaking conditions of Hungary
SHAME
Mazepin - Bottas looks up to me
Valtteri its james-Well Done
KARMA x2 for RedBull and not a word from Christian Horner..."The Universe has spoken"...at the beginning of the summer break: Imagine that.
A crazy race
The two Mercedes drivers causing two accidents in two consecutive races that take out their two main opponents and favor them massively. Coincidence?
I would say that it was just a small bit of bottas fault he locked up he could not do anything about it
Alonso the real MVP of this race for keeping Hamilton behind him as long as possible
Alonso demostrando su gran manejo, Hamilton no podía hacer nada, gran carrera para Alpine, alguien me puede explicar que trato de hacer Bottas, ya lo habían revisado se ve que se frustró porqué salió mal y después se ve en vez de frenar acelera más y hacé que choquen en una carambola
Alonso awesome....best driver ever no discussion putting Hamilton on trouble with slower car like alpine....let's hope he will get better car next season..
Next vid, Esteban Ocon moments of brilliance
Bottas impostor
Nico Rosberg made this race extra interesting
Alonso holding Lewis like a beast. Then comes Sainz...
finally, the perfect f1 race that im waiting for
Did Lewis make some world record by being the only car to be on track on a race start?
At first I thought "Ehhhh, clever from George"...
The way Hamilton was complaining about Alonso is iconic
Wow wow wow...  F1 is coming around!  What a podium.  But Crofty is a maniac - "Double Bubble"--  WHA???
2:45 "How dare Schumacher made contact with Verstappen, this was Verstappen's corner, he knew he was there he should have got out of the way. I have lost respect for the Schumacher family, his father needs to return all the trophies ... "
Now i want f1 to make "How Ocon Shocked Hungaroring"
Bottas wrecks five people = 5 grid place penalty Vettel runs out of fuel = instant DQ This is not how the rules should be enforced.
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate Mazepin's DNF due to a pit lane crash... thanks :)
Bottas bottled this race to take out Red Bull and his teammate benefitted to finish second place. What a dramatic lap one. Well done to Alpine team for their first F1 win!! Williams are back on track. with points. Back to the drawing board for Red Bull AGAIN.
When Hamilton started by himself, I laughed so hard!! Jokes aside, big congrats to Ocon on the win, and the Williams team too for getting points, they deserve it coming from a Merc fan!
Bottas i hate you so much
sjw blowhard gets gifted again.
I can't believe how fast that Mercedes is. Kinda sus
Bottas takes out 3 cars gaining a contract and both driver and constructor championships
Alonso be like I am not bottas
What a great race. All three drivers put their all into getting on podium. Well done Ocon. I bet on you to win based on negative remarks from hater YouTube channel “formula world” and you killed it. Perfect man!
Hamilton hellriders
i think reverse grid might work this was brilliant
Max: Hamilton shouldn't be celebrating like that.  Bottas: Did you mean Mercedes?
Hamilton "Starts" 14 and becomes easily 3rd (except of Alonso). Seriously what is the point to watch this?
Best driver of the week: Ms verstaffen O sorry, I want mean the worst Take it merda
Sorry Russel, Bottas the best wingman ever for Hamilton
Mercedes: takes out Hamilton's only competitor on track. Lewis: I'm leading the championship because I'm simply the best driver
Mic actually prevented Lewis from winning btw . If he didn't come out of the pits at that point Lewis was easily throw on the pit straight
Yes ocon won but DOUBLE WILLIAM POINTS BOYS
No one's challenging Ocon for the win.              Race Stewards: Was he racing in an acceptable manner?
These weeks hurt as a max fan
Engineer:Vallteri, its James. Plan D... Send all Lewis competitor out. Bottas: Noted n executed
No one wants to talk about the drive Hamilton put in. Toxic community.
That's accident or intended... I don't know 🤥🤥🤥
Bottas just earned his contract extension taking out 2 Red Bull’s
Not bad race, but seems maFIA and bad f1 management want to destroy f1 by the silliest decisions , this f bias sport now dream to see it vanish , now made for 1 cry black baby and team . Let me see how many i d i o t will reply to me
Hahha verstappen loooooser
1:19 doing a solo race in GTA Online be like:
Dumb Bottas should be banned during wet races Guy is a safety hazard at Rainy condition
I hate hamilton
Two Red Bulls Bottas.. Bottas : copy mate. it's easy
For Initial D fans Bottas went full Shingo 😝🤣
Thank You Bottas you make it more interesting
Bottas: I took out two red bulls right after turn one  Coulthard: I took out the whole field after turn one
Am I the only one, not appreciating Rosberg to comment the race?
vettel’s hard work meant nothing when he was disqualified because of technical issue. there was more than 1 litre of fuel in his car, but sadly bad luck seems to hit some drivers worse than others.  congrats to the williams, george and nikki. very much deserved points after years of hard work. wonder if sir frank and claire enjoyed that as well.
I wish Alonso gets signed by a top team
Incredible
Hamilton: I am starting alone? Blessed!  Everbody else in the pits: Hold our tyres
This was an absolutely incredible race, however such races really highlight how bad Crofty is. He is so often talking about some historical event or random stats when there's something exciting happening on the screen which he's not reacting to. I badly wanted to hear Rosberg's reactions to action as it was happening, but you always had to wait until a few corners later once Crofty had finished shouting.
Bottas out from mercedes! Bad driver
I have to watch with the sound muted because of that loud annoying commentator
Still not entirely sure how max can go off track and barge others off without investigation 🤷🏼‍♂️
Bottas’s Red Bull takeout could not have worked better if it had been planned.
If Lando didn't break when Bottas hit , he may have taken Lewis tooo
What is Lando Norris thinking?
The last 5 laps were crucial for Hamilton
2:52~ Hate tappen.
Helmut Marko and Christian Horner probably asked AlphaTauri to steal the fastest lap point from Hamilton.
Let us call this Formula Hamilton. A place to parade him as a winner, irrespective of whoever is best driver out there.
Hamilton the only person on the grid is the 3rd best thing happened in the race
bottas does not suit formula 1
Toto: "we're still unsure about your contract for next year..." Valteri: "watch this..."
I give it to alpine but they never would of won if bottas did that
Toto said Bottas is unnecessary!
I thought Bottas was going to win the race but he dnfed in the first turn itself😭🤣
What a race Bottas
im so dissapointed at the fia, they have literally spoiled the start of the month for me.
Wow Riciardo… the best chance to get a podium and still comes in out of the points…..😭😭
1st max do nothing to save his race after the accident hammilton  do anything to save his race after the pit stop and this situation [and more others] show us the big difference between the drivers hammilton is mugh better than max.2nd but this year we see how -s..... -its mercedes and hammilton what a mistake from both almost in every race.3nd bottas i dont understand what his offer in mercedes 4th perez until now big dissapoint 5th alonso in this circuit keep the hammilton back and gine the win to ocon if red bull have alonso  with max the situations for mercedes will be chaos.bravo to vettel dont forget him and the disqualified its the responcibility of his team to see what happen.
So did Bottas have a brain fade or was he sent out to cause chaos?
*Bottas woke up and chose violence that day.*
The way Lando cut across Bottas - isn't that a little illegal? Bottas could have braked sooner but there was also no room for Bottas between Sainz and Perez.
Russell: "At this rate, everyone is going to box." Hamilton at 1:18: But not for me!
Perez and Verstappen : Playing Project Cars Hamilton : Playinng Grid Autosport Bottas : WRECKFEST.
Vettel robbed
Bottas deserves a seat after that.
This is becoming a little suspicious, don't you think?
If you can't beat them RAM them!!!!
Another great race in Hungaroring.
Mercedes are unbelievable cheaters
TOTO : Hey Valtteri , Lewis and I were going to bowling. You want to come .  BOTTAS : Thanks toto , but i already have plans.
Harika enfes bir yarış oldu.her ne kadar Mercedes taraftarı olsamda. Alonso yu özlemişim neden efsane olduğunu bir daha gösterdi.
Bottas: Task failed successfully!
f1 hungary 2021 = motogp catalunya 2019
Can somebody explain why verstappen could not overtake anyone but hamilton overtook half the grid ?
Did Mercedes tell Bottas to crash Verstappen on the start? Sure seems like it, and the wet weather is an excuse for it
This race is pure meme material
That announcer is so obnoxious.  Stop. YELLING!
So i guess bottas crash lando to crash double red bull so lewis can win? What a genius
Sebastian got disqualified 🥲
The biggest cheat in F1 history - THE FIA/STEWARDS
NO WAYY LEWIS BEAT MAX UGH
Vettel's slow pitstop cost him the win, but still great to see him on the podium again. Hopefully the penalty gets removed
YES YES YES!! GEORGE RUSSEL FINALY SCORES A POINT
Imagine merc fans in Belgium and Netherlands lol
BOTTAS : So will i get the drivers seat for 2022 ?  TOTO : take out both the Red Bulls and i will think about it .
Bravo por Alpine y Alonso
To those of you who don't know , VETTEL WAS LATER DISQUALIFIED AND LOST HIS 2nd PLACE DUE TO FUEL SAMPLE ISSUE. gotta feel for him.
Remember when alpine boss said ocon ain't a world champion driver material ( this week in an interview). well.... Well.....  Well..... If there was any way to prove him wrong, ocons driving in the race proved him wrong...
Ocon and Max has Alonso to thank for. Ocon on his first win and Max for only being down 6 points.
Heartbreaking for McLaren 😢💔🧡
Second race in a row with a shame on you, Mercedes.
Alonso blocking Hamilton is the best thing I have ever seen today.
If Lewis wins this title he can think his grub Silverstein move as well his punt em off  team mate
Bottas showing Merc he is the best no.2 an willing to take out the competition to prove it 🤔
Has Horner protested anything yet?
Shambles how can you have a competition where half get crashed in first seconds
Commentator: "Bottas has hit both Red Bulls" Me: "Well that's his job, right?"
Mercedes should pay the repair bills...
Bottas just "maldonaldo" both Red Bull
Bottas his best race of the season by far
This Mercedes 🅱️lan is 🅱️ery interesting from 🅱️ottas 🤔
Toto Wolff - We are going to fully weaponize  Bottas - Say no more boss  *Murders both red bulls and a McLaren*
This will be the turning point if Max lose the championship.
So… Red flag?
Très bon Très bien monsieur Ocon
If Lewis ended up coming into the pits and everyone else followed, what would they have done? Another formation lap or just start racing out of the pit lane?
Wow.. vestappen elbow out from inside. Maybe he learn that from lewis i supposed and if it is max, is legal.😄
Har har max fans.
the start all the way until turn 1, looks exactly like how unranked races in F1 2020 & 2021.
How the F is Hamiltons so lucky all the time
And the FIA say that reverse grid's won't work... This is as close to one we've had to one for a full race, and it was amazing! Look at all the on-track action we had!
I’m not saying it was on purpose. I almost feel like somethings should be done though. Two races in row Mercedes has taken out Red Bull. How is this acceptable?? They pretty much DNF’d both cars
imagine no cars took the start, only the medical car
Mercedes: we need 2 redbull cars out. Bottas : yes sir.
Bottas looks like his intention to hit McLaren... As they expected to hit the 2 redbull car.. Coz max is a big threat
Shame on the FIA for DQ-ing Vettel's 2nd place finish
Can't pass an Alpine star for 4 laps.  HE Is THe gReATest dRiVER eVeR
This is what f1 has been missing
I feel bad for Mazepin.  Nah just kidding.
Seriously, am I the only one that hates the commentator here? AND IT'S LIGHTS OUT.... Why does he have to shout all the time?
Félicitations Esteban !! 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
This was a weird one
Love how everyone just glosses over the stupidity of Stroll's move.
Max: How am I slipping down the points table without even making any mistake Team Mercedes: ABRA CADABRA
Que triste que no tengas un ápice de escrúpulos cuando me indicaron no creer en la categoría pensé en darles una oportunidad después de 3 años me siento frustrado y asqueado nunca más volveré a ver las carreras con la misma ilusión lo vet
modern classic for sure 😂
Redbull prepared for Lewis. Bottas was out of the syllabus!
Lando TOOK the braking area away from Bottas, and risked the chance of contact..oh wait there was CONTACT!!  Lance on the other hand, outbraked himself into the 1st corner and took out essentially 2 cars Leclerc, and Ricciardo. Lance is the driver who deserved the 5 race grid penalty next race. FIA have a long long history of never getting it right!!!!
Congrats to Ocon
I think it might be the best race of this season
Alonso gave us in the last three races, what we are waiting f1 to be
Que triste que este deporte se terminó
Que poca madre de Bottas, estrategia para parar a Red Bull.!!🤬🤬🤬🤬
Embarrassing driving at the start of this race.
F1 new Kamikaze
1:35 At the restart, first time ever, safety car almost overtook half the pack.
Bravo Alpine team!
1:19 Hamilton:WHERE THE HECK IS EVERYONE?!?
After VETTEL's disqualification it's so logical FIA's members want 8th LEWIS' world title...
I seriously hope mercedes are not planning this, very convenient how everything played out
Buen video!!!
Wow what a race!
Ferrari is getting more shy ... getting softer ..
FIA will say no investigation against Mercedes. Bcoz its Mercedes moral right to win like this
Can I know what’s the difference between online races and Hungary turn 1
Hamilton destroyedax last week, Bottas takes out Red Bull and 2 others, and they get hilarious penalty, Vettel does the race with that s..t car hess got a ban for fuel. FIA is a piece of s.t
Hamilton alone on the grid, almost INDIANAPOLIS...
the way this was filmed was brilliant
Valtteri, it's James, take 2 Red Bulls out
Thanks, VALTERRI 😌
Thank you, FORMULA 1!
Renault 1st win after the 2006 Malaysian grand prix ! Could have been better if fernando won this but a French driver wining for French team is just icing on cake
If I had a race horse that raced like RICCIARDO. I would take it out the back and shoot it
Red bull gives you whinges!!!
Shame on Mercedes team. Planning such way to take out redbulls
Jajaja qué casualidad
2:24
That was pretty exciting to watch.
Somethings a bit suspicious here, another mercedes took out the redbulls. And also, proof that f1 favours hamilton, bottas got a 5 place grid penalty for visually less damage and the drivers being unhurt, unlike hamilton at silverstone
Bottas send max and perez out - 5 grid penalty Hamilton sent max into the wall and out - 10 second. Ok fair enough
I think we can all agree that Alonso is the best driver on the grid (coming from a Vettel fan who disliked Alonso in 2012) ,  Hamilton is the luckiest driver in F1 history and Mercedes are the worst (cheats) defending champions in F1 history
I hope there will be a team other than RedBull who will appeal the case for another crash gate, this time by Bottas hammer time bowling for causing carnage especially damage to verstappen, perez, norris, and my favorite driver Leclerc who had best opportunity to score podium or even race win.. what a moronic move... two accidents by mercedes in two consecutive races? Such coincidence? Never believe things happened coincidentally especially  when mercs  said its easier to handle a hard battle with other teams driver instead internal drivers like rosberg. I'm too salty now to see disgusting act from mercedes in achieving points. No honor for them really..  But very happy to see ocon, vettel and alonso as the best performers ... hope vettel will retain his 2nd place position and disqualification will be void..
Toto after 2nd stop : luweez you can win deez
Hamilton taking  out 1 redbull.  Bottas taking 2 rebulls ! What a shame from mercedes
Huh.. #5 on trending
Hamilton: Everybody's in the pits.  It's Hammer Time! Everybody: Hold our beers.
vettel is disqualified shame on fia
It's obvious that most racers don't like Hamilton...
1:18
Hands down the best race of the season so far.
Bottas should have got driver of the day for doing what FIA hasn't been able to do for years.... Make F1 interesting
Messcedes Bangzzzzz!!!
1:25 I hope next time the medical machine will at least fight!
I wonder how much the spray from Norris blinded Bottas. That gap got real tight real quick and u dont really want to be moving L&R at the start if u cant see. Watching Alonso was thrilling. The DRS era does seem to take away some of the brilliant blocking of yesteryear
Why this subtitles has to cover all the video? Can't locate the car
Just as when I think F1 could not be more interesting  BOTTAS: and I took that personally!!
Ocon fantastic drive, Bottas torpedo
Alpine Renault is my team this year, If they could just change the Baluga design its not that aero.
3:18 OwO what is that?
I wish Leclerc could have stayed alive on lap 1
1 car grid start is one cool thing to see
Perez needs to step up in the torpedo game for RB.
Alonso was holding Ham, changed to watch Argentina v Germany Hockey game  1st quarter ended  Came back and Alonso was still in front
Don't you think Bottas should get some penalty ?🤔
Idk why max stuck at p10 while lewis can manage to get podium. Is there some kind of problem with the car?
Why he is best after ayrton seenna...he slowly showing Again that he is boss...
Hamilton is so annoying bro 🤣
Mercedes has problematic reputation.
Locking up into a car on a wet track: five place start penalty Flat out into a car on a dry track: ten second stop and go
6:37  V12 noises........
Even in a midfield (race winning..?) car, Alonso shows once again this season why he is one of the greatest of all time. Meanwhile, Bottas..
Alonso's defense was enough to entertain everyone, that lock up was the only reason why Hamilton got pass him. WOO for both Williams too!
Vettel got disqualified 😭😭
Mercedes ultimate plan take out 2 red bulls
Toto: Valterri take out Red Bull. Valterri: Ok can I take out Norris too? Toto: Umm…ok …sure if that helps you I guess why not. Valterri: And what about Leclerc and Sainz? Toto: What about leclerc and Sainz?…….fine you know what ? do what you want..Goodbye Valterri: To think of it I don’t like the way Russ.. Toto: GOODBYE Valterri
Cómo permite la FIA que un vehículo de F1 compita sin frenos??? Es un riesgo para todos los demás vehículos y pilotos. La sanción que se imponga , debe incluir a la escudería Mercedes también. Si esto no fue así, entonces estamos hablando de algo fuera de lo deportivo , de intencionalidad para perjudicar a sus mas cercanos competidores. La FIA debe analizar bien este accidente, de otra forma se pensará en la complacencia que se le tiene a esa escudería, a Mercedes, favoreciéndola no en uno sino en varios accidentes involucrando a sus pilotos y saben que su sanción será mínima, en tiempo. La FIA puede caer de autoridad en la F1 a cómplice. Y si es cómplice ya no se le considerará el organismo regulador de la F1 sino siempre se sospechará de ellos.
What a race
The fact that Esteban has more wins and podiums than nico hulkenberg lol        (No offense to hulk it’s a joke)
Thank you Esteban and Fernando for this unforgettable performance🔥 Esteban, this win was a long time coming, congratulations 🔥
That one car start 🔥🔥
보타스가 자신을 희생해서 라이벌 레드불 2명을 날렸지. 1타2피!!
This is how I drive in forza online time in home😒
I don’t know why..Lewis saying “It’s Dry” made me laugh 😂
Their pitstops are so fkn slow . They should learn a thing or two from Luigi.
Szép volt Lewis Hamilton!💪🇬🇧
Toto: Its decided.... Hammertime Hamilton Bowlingtime Bottas
F for bottas
Every Multiplayer race:
To avoid drivers to be reckless  causing accidents, they should be billed for the damages that they cause, I am sure that this way will control themselves and drive more responsable.
Mercedes always makes f1 not interesting
After play a bowling game, contract signed until 2025 secured.
Why didn't Hamilton pit at the restart?
Can someone tell where lance stroll thought he was gonna fit?
Definitivamente Hamilton solo hace cosas impresionantes o gana puntos solo por el vehículo, cuálesquier piloto que tuviese ese coche ganaría y sería campeón.
I’m telling you all, the only way Mercedes can win from now on is to make sure the red bull cars are pushed off the track
New Mercedes strategy: KAMIKAZE
Bottas took out two redbull cars under mercedes orders 😂😂😂 jk
hamilton did not pit before the race to show that he was the only car on track in 2014, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20
Nobody Absolutely nobody Alonso: *Mr Worldwide*
imagine cheering for retardelton overtaking
This race and the 2017 Azerbaijan race is amongst one of the greatest races I've seen in the hybrid era.
Hamilton at the restart must be thinking that Bottas took out the whole field.
So bottas hits norris... Who is sent hitting perez i think and bottas hits max
2:44 "maybe Verstapen tried to hit his left side to balance it with the right side that is already damaged" - a romanian commentator
Bottas just earned himself a seat for Mercedes next year
❤️❤️❤️
La mala leche de Bottas es terrible y la suerte de Hamilton es tremenda u.u y lo choto que es ese Sain es impresionante,ni una vuelta lo pudo contener a Hamilton.
Seb is Robbed 😔😔😔
But Vettle is.... yeah
Rain: Changes the course of the race Qualifying: Am I  a joke to you :D
The one thing you cant take away from hamilton is his desire to win he gives 100% effort
This has to be the most emotionally breaking race of the decade... we saw Alonso Hamilton battle, vettel DSQ, Max driving a broken car into the points and the last thing which anyone has ever thought double point finish for williamsssss!!!😭🤩🙏  Edit:- I am small content creator from india...please dive in and subscribe if you like it
this is how i know bottas will get re-signed.  there's no way russell can take out TWO redbulls in one move.
Respect for Latifi keep on P3 for so long
"Tradition"  Valterie Bottas
2 years ago it was crashstappen now its crashercedes
shocking commentary in this one from Crofty. was expecting more. but huge improvement in tv direction in this grand prix. showed pretty much all the action they could, livetime.
recent merc strategies allow me to win online races easily, no wonder they are the leading team rn
Both Williams on the Points baby!
SHAME to disqualify Vettel
Yeah baby... HAMILTON BACK TO THE LEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
does ocon get his oconsistency back??
What Bottas do is what we've done on nfs, f1 games, forza, rr3, gran turismo (maybe...), and other racing games
Most fun grand prix of my life
Get in there Valtteri! 😬
2nd place for the GOAT 👊👊
It's been ages since we've had some first corner chaos
Mercedes: red bull is in form they can crush us  Hamilton: I'll try my best  Bottas: no problem... Were don't get penalties 😀
nobody likes to talk about williams? 8 & 9
Bottas se sacrifica para darle más distanvia ha Hamilton.
Mercedez: Get in em bottas! Excellent job!!
1:23 what if hamilton also pitted then?????..... Does there will be light's out...... For ERICSSON 😜
HAHAHA THIS HILARIOUS SJJAJAJAJAJ BOTTAS PLAYING BOWLING
That was amazing. Congratulations to Ocon and the Williams team! Double points finish!
Some of you are wondering why I've summoned you here today...
The battle between max and mich was amazing
Danny blue flag Never thought I would see this day
This commentator is way too excited about everything. Chill dude...
Grande final espero que devolvam a posição do Vettel
4:30
Hamilton on the grid all by himself is by far the funniest thing this season. The fact that he was on intermediates on a bone dry track was even funnier! What a race!!! ❤️
The championship is over. Every race a Mercedes car will take a Red Bull car out of the race.
Can we have like 4 races per year at the hungaro ring??😍
Great Mercedez team strat. Sacrificing Bottas again. Well done🤭
wow what a race
crashing into 3 cars and only received 2 penalty points
Well driven by alsonso, even with a slower car he managed to stop lewis till the last, also ocon was impressive
Vettel is disqualified after the race for not being able to provide enough fuel sample to the FIA I heard.  :C
williams and alpine are having a party later that day
Mercedez: "Let's go with plan B, Plan B" Bottas: Bowling mode engaged
I've been watching F1 ever since Xbox made a game called F1 2013 free for download in May 2015. Lewis is my favorite driver of course. But it's never been more fun to watch other people win. And yeah, I'm getting sick of seeing a one horse show, hopefully that will change next year. Would be awesome for each race to be as entertaining as this was today. Just about lost my lunch in the first corner !!   LOL  Oh, and I"m for Lando in that Merc seat. Wont happen, but how awesome would that be.
Bottas desperate to keep his Merc seat
Lewis like a boss!  Dutch fans on suicide watch!
Mercedes has turned F1 into a demolition derby
Lewis crashed with Max so Bottas be like: Anything you can do I can do better.
"Bottas crashgate'' how low are Mercedes gonna stoop to win the championship. If this is how it goes about them F1 is really a bogus sport.👎🏼👎🏼
Mercedes 8 for 8 in 2021 baby! 🏆
BOTTAS   needs to go,  im sorry but this guy will never win a champion ship , not on ANY F1 TEAM.    Never.   Merc should have replaced him 2 yrs ago
Corriganme si estoy mal pero en el min: 5:42 cuando Hamilton va luchando con Sains, abre el alerón trasero cuando ya no está en el margen en el que se puede usar el DRS
As a newer F1 fan, seeing Alonso’s defense was just amazing! Legend indeed.
Mercedes purposely ran into red bull
With the race aside, Nico Rosberg's commentary was very insightful!
I watched this highlights 5 times and it's still not enough.  Is there is another video of Alonso blocking Hamilton for 15 laps?
Vettel disqualified it hurts 😭
I called my little sister to show the shenanigans of second standing start. This was too much to watch alone XD
Lewis Hamilton is the team principal of Aston Martin.this why he didn't fuel Vettel's car properly
Bottos: For MERCEDES!!! For LEWIS!!!
Fake audio cheers lol
so merc just cheated again
Can’t wait till Lewis lifts his EIGHTH championship. 🐐
Here after seb disqualified from this event even if he win there icon was the certain winner
Hamilton shows why he is the best driver in this generation
We're too full to be Hungary, now we have to relax in a spa
Toto: "Valtteri, did you get my email?" Valtteri: "Sir. Yes Sir."
SEB WAS ROBBED
6:38 so sooooooooo beautifullllllll
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IS GOING ON WITH HAMILTON?! Famous guy is having a heart attack on live television around the world ON THE PODIUM IN FRONT OF ALL EYES, and no one talks about it?!
alonso👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 bottas👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Really impressed by the mature drive by Ocon super consistent and made no errors which kept Vettel behind
out of all the races this season why did it have to be this one that i missed live. my luck
The only way Mercedes can beat Redbull now is by crashing into them…
Bottas is the greatest wingman Mercedes ever had!
1:22 I burst out laughing every time
Sorry I don't want t see the race anymore Verstappen is my only excitement, Mercedes is not playing a fair game 😭
Botas biang kerok, strol onyon
Bottas : Sorry I took out both Red Bull drivers, also Leclerc and Norris. Hamilton : I owe you one mate. Team Mercedes : Job well done Bottas, $ will be wired to your off - shore account in Cayman Island. Me : Just kidding folks 😱👍🤣❤️
Sadly, Vettel was disqualified :'(
imagine alonso at red bull
For Bottas it's bad bad year with crashes
so glad Ham stayed out
Haha what the race
I was more excited that Williams got double points than Ocon's first win. Crazy race though
History remembers Hamilton as a Cheating Champion.
Oh man Seb got disqualified. That's disappointing
Valttrie: Driver of the day...
If Hamilton came to P1 Vettel wouldn’t have loosed his P3. Now politically he lost 18points for Lewis getting more 3points. Well done team FIA Mercedes 🤦🏻‍♂️
Mercedes is like the Real Madrid Barcelona of F1 — they can get away with anything.
Now this, is racing.
Perez Q3: We need to get them tomorrow....  Bottas Lap 1: We got em Both 😂😂
red flag was way too long. we could have a wet race. i suspect fia making red flag unecessary long to avoid racing again on wet conditions.
BOTTAS TOOK OUT BOTH RED BULL CARS
What happened to LH going down from P1 to P14?
わざとではないにしろ メルセデスのイメージがなんとも....
Well Done To Williams! P8 and P9!
Mercedes to Bottas: you're going to have to do something drastic if you want to keep your seat for next year  Bottas: *I got u fam*
this is by far my favourite race of all  -merc didnt win -alonso amazing defense -williams scored points -russell was in podium places temporarily  sad that seb got disqualified, didnt really know how that could have happened
Sainz è un debole
Mercs we already know your strategy. Using the poster boy’s team mate once again to take out the bulls. It’s pretty obvious.
Mercedes to McLaren be like....it's time to pay the real price for my engine!
only 1 car on the grid really looks weird,I'm used to seeing a bunch of cars on the grid before lights out and away we go
Hamilton for 2021 champion 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
1:19 Lewis: Where everybody? Race Engineers: They are start from pit lane  Flashback 2005 United States Grand Prix
Ocon did not got it easy enough he had Vettel behind him, too.
from picking trash to getting disqualified. Vettel
One more thing. Were getting tired of this anglo centric bias. THE CAMERAS was 90% on Hamilton and Russell yet the race leasers had almost no tv time or commentary until the race was over. Very minimal for vestappen aswell. Even the commentators were mostly talking about hamilton, russell and even norris who wasnt even in the race anymore. THE world is starting to take notice. Like others have said in other sports Anglo bias is worse than Americans.
Some pressure and we are seeing the real colours of Mercedes-Benz... Are these the values of the brand? Disgusting.
Great commentary with Nico in the box as well.
Everybody except Hamilton: Let's test the London E-Prix diGrassi technique
And Bottas gets a big cash payment from Toto
I'm a Verstappen fan, but this race didn't make me mad at all LOL, rather funny with that ultra-divebombing🤣
Cool tactic from the Mercs, when loosing just take the opponents out by your second looser driver.
Bottas to Daniil Kvyat “Did you like that torpedo?”  Daniil Kvyat “Yes!”
Mercedes MVP:  Bottas. Unbelievable.  Mercedes is truly gripping and will do anything to retain the title.........
Ocon's browser history after the race be like - What to do after you win an F1 race - How to enter the Parc Ferme
Where's vax cant even win without the help of teammates? lol
Why not disqualify Oocon, didn’t he run out of fuel as well?
Wow, crazy race! Wish I could've seen it live, had to settle for highlights
Toto - it is Bottas’s fault
maFIA
Does bottas get a penalty because of that incident?
I honestly believe Bottas took the redbull on purpose. That is how Mercedes work.
Congratulations Ocon, and Alpine. Trully deserved
Hamilton started the race alone after the red flag 🤣🤣
vettel is disqualified and his car is sealed until further notice. FIA is mafia
F1 = Mercedes1
0:32 Bottas steering towards Checo after crashing??
Russel got points! That's what really matters here.
I am here for the comments :)
Lewis was promoted to 2nd due to Aston Martin not being able to provide enough post race fuel sample.  So no conspiracy theories and blaming Hamilton for everything bad that happens to Max?
Congratulations Alpine first win.
This race is exciting
One lap more => Ham win!
0:06  -  0:18  Lol, it's like a race played by me using hotwheels cars
I'm sure one the drive to survive episodes is going to focus on this race and Alpine. I think every episode has a main subject/team  to talk about every episode
Bottas go full kama kazi
Es una mierda la f1
Interesting Tactics....
It is always suspicious to me ..The Lead driver after redflag restart know it is dry but still that team didn't called him for pits for dry tyres. The people who run F1 do this below reasons 1. They want to make the championship exciting till the season end. 2. The other championship contender has car damage and no simply no chance  3. They want to see different winners to make it look like unpredictable & exciting... Another EX is car no 44 wheel lockup in Baku... Perez win last year  Prepare yourself for another situation like this in upcoming races for Ferrari win
Red Bull to Kvyat: We need you for some job to do 😎 Kvyat: Say no more 🚀
Best driver today is Lewis Hamilton. That was a lot of work here lewis u did well  that’s how I would do it.😂👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
absolutely tapped
I will never forgive what the FIA did to Vettel.
Bruh Bottas took out both Red Bulls and now Lewis has the championship lead. Max Verstappen has scored 1 point in the past 2 races due to a Mercedes car on both occasions. What a joke.
F1 can I sign up for race
Congrats Valteri,  now you have better Chances for a contract with Mercedes in 2022
Why is no body talking about how Lewis on the podium literally was breathing and almost fainting and falling on the ground like he's having a heart attack on the podium? I that dude alright?
Bottas: I ensured a podium for my teammate by bowling all of his front running rivals both out of the race and out of contention. Vote me for best wingman!  Alonso: I ensured a maiden victory for my teammate by playing the podium gatekeeper and keeping a championship contender on my tail for 10 laps. Vote me for best wingman!
Best race of the season so far....🔥🔥❤
Garfaram Sebastian Vettel. Incrível como tudo acaba favorecendo Hamilton...
This has been the best season in many years !
Not gonna lie, this is probably the most exciting race of 2021
Chances are that Valtteri will likely get his contract renewed. Such painful race to watch.
Is everyone that was whining about Hamilton fixing car during red flag at Silverstone similarly outraged that Max was able to fix his car in Hungary?
Alonso defence reminded me of Schumi vs Hamilton in Monza 2011, They just race different.
“A life spent making mistakes is not only more honorable, but more useful than a life spent doing nothing.” ..
BOTTAS has ONE job only today.
Esse bottas
Ocon conquista Hungria
It's evident just how Merc is going about taking out RB.
You can use me as ai dislike button for the FIA disqualifing Seb from P2
ocon: yeah all y'all big dogs can fight down there I'll just breeze thru and wait for u at the finish line
Netflix looking at this season like: 💲💲💲
Bottas was a ticking timebomb for both the redbulls. Mercedes plans succeeds
BOTTAS SEALING HIS 2022 MERCEDES SEAT
Why is the commentator so animated when essentially nothing is happening?
FY Merceedes!
A SCREAMING ANNOUNCER DOES NOT EMBELLISH THE RACING EXPERIENCE !!!  SEEMS A DESPERATE ATTEMPT TO CONJURE UP EXCITEMENT  !!!
nico rosberg did like tony romo comentating in NFL, nico did great jod comentating this GP, hope he will do in future GP
Ah yes. The classic “ram your opponents off the track” method. I’ve seen this one before.
Does Croft really have to shout so much
We must get a video for Alonso and Hamilton like the one we got for Charles and Max in Silverstone
Well done Seb!
Now i remember what toto said before the race Thera are more crashes to come.
Sebastian Vettel sadly has been disqualified from the race cause they were unable to provide 1 litre of fuel which means everyone gains a place therefore lewis got 2nd and Williams got more points and Raikkonen also got a point
Just a normal F1 multiplayer lobby
From last to 2nd place that's how champion drive.
La F1 ya se ha convertido en un circo armado para Mercedes. Justo "casualmente" se ponen delante Verstappen y Red Bull y empiezan a pasar cosas que favorecen a Mercedes.. decepcionante vergonzoso y muy evidente !!!
Bottas 5 posiciones de castigo. Y Hamilton ganó la carrera pasada? Cómo que no cuadran los castigos.
Chaotic!
Didn't realise this race was an online multiplayer
"Its dangerous man"  It was safe in Silverstone right blessed king?
Brilliant move by Mercydes in the first round 🔥
BAN mercedes forever from racing.
Excellent race by Alonso and Ocon. What a rush to finish this first part...
Vettel getting disqualified is some bs
GOOOO HAMILTON 💪❤️❤️❤️
If you cant beat them, ...........
Briliant strategy by Mercedes. sacrifice one driver to secure World Champion
Vettel disqualified and lulu is 2nd? Why not simply hand him the trophy and be done with it.
I love that on certain days, some of these drivers are able to take full advantage of the power of these cars. It’s racing artwork.
when latifi scores more than russel me- phhhhh haaahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahah!
Tooooorpedo.
Alonso was a key to ocon win that race. really...
Marko and Horner have recreated the crash with their third driver and will present to the FÍA proving that Bottas aimed his Mercedes at Norris to push him into Verstappen. Referee !!!
Helmut Marko Reveales The Have been Upgrading Yukis Car So He Can Go on Full Kamikaze at Belgium
This is the type of stuff that happens on that one crazy day that u don’t come to school on
🅱️ottas Master🅱️lan to keep his Mercedes seat for 2022
Bottas: What should I do to keep the 2022 seat? Toto: Beat the Red Bulls Bottas: OK! (goes literally)
ALONSO Is a Legend ; I wished to see Ocon Win though he had been Consistent Throughout the race but Still he needed Alonso
Cyril must be proud of Alpine team (Renault).
🇨🇵
So Mercedes takes out another two Red Bulls. We're supposed to believe that was a complete accident?
Looks like everyone is racing for Hamilton again...
F1 2021 multiplayer simulation damage
So haters say that Lewis Hamilton was taught a lesson by a true champion, yet he came out ahead of that champion to celebrate in the podium, and not only that, but to the lead in drivers standing,  like it wasn't enough, he put the team on top in the constructors standings as well. That's why he is a hated true champion, he rises at the worst moments carrying the whole team on his shoulders.
Alonso to Lewis : In the race If you ever see tail lights of my car, you will never see my head lights...
Bottas plan 1&2 Plan 1.if it is wet start, you just need to break late and take them in your  way Plan 2: Dont let max pass you by any how
Bottas and Lando (Mercedes’ engine) crash and now Seb disqualification. LH and Mercedes world champion on the way
New Mercedes strategy,: Just take ‘em out on the first lap!
Bottas 🎳🎳🎳
Verstappen just can't catch a break
The difference you see when Yuki tries to defend his position against Hamilton, and when Alonso defends his position against Hamilton is just MASSIVE!! 💪
Where is Max? Oh, still busy complaining his lost in Silverstone 😀😀
F1 tv was absolutely atrocious today. Nico is an announcer and you forced pit lane coverage for the first 30 minutes? It was really bad. Someone needs to go and take a listen so you see I'm not blowing smoke. You really need to fire whoever made that decision. It was disastrous.
insane GP!!
Deliberately from Bottas.
Bottas will get a new Mercedes contract.... Eliminate 2 main competitors single handedly.. 😁
Im a bit sad of sebs disqualification from his podium
That's what Verstappen always does. Force his way and bump his opponent tires. Another example with Nikita Mazepin. Lucky he didt crash or else Nikita will be blame.
Mclaren ang mercedes push red bull
Did everyone forget how too drive?
Noooo lando lost his streak :(
For once, not Mazepin’s fault he dnf’d
James: "maFIA it's James,you need to give that p2 to us. Toto: i sent you an email did you check? MaFIA: let me find the rule book   Hrs later: Vettel DQF
is rosberg commenting??
Let's start a petition Rosberg for commentator and Palmer for Steward
Hmm well if Mercedes continue to literally smash the competition then I think a full team disqualification should be considered. Obviously it's way too soon for that and blown way out of proportion but in 3 races if this is still happening I would consider disqualification because it's ruining the integrity of the sport.That being said massive congratulations to Ocon for winning his first GP!
Bottas breaking late must be investigated.
Lewis: Help. These Red Bulls are chasing me. Valtteri: I got you Bro. I'm going ham at them.
Anything to favor Hamilton. immoral FIA....... Vettel
team works makes the dream works
Look at the name above and spread the word
Perez : “we’ll take the tomorrow” Mercedes : and we took that personally
I did wonder if Mercedes would use Bottas as the rear gunner ;)
I really love these race highlights with comentary 👌 perfect length to keep to action
this isn the worst crash and f1 ever
Is nobody gonna talk about strategy of Mercedes? Last race, lewis makes verstappen out of the race. Now bottas makes everyone competing with lewis get out of the race. Mmmm Whats going on
Bottas sengaja b tabrak disuruh itu sama depe bos
George out qualifying Latifi everytime but gets only 2 points to Latifi's 4
Alonso had no right to hold Lewis for that long man's a crafty racer, what defence
I didn't know f1 2020 online could be so realistic. I also didn't know mercedes has a new strategy, involving a second driver, a torpedo and half the cars on the grid.
how to beat red bull = go full nascar mode
Anything Hamilton can do, Bottas can do better! Last race Hamilton hit one Redbull, this race Bottas hit both....
amazing race, congrast ocon great alonso dan amazing ham spirit. yeahh
Correct me if I’m wrong but had Hamilton pitted on the formation lap at the restart, he probably would have still lost many place right? Cause their pit box is the first one at the pit entry and while his tires are being changed other cars are going through the lane and Hamilton would have to wait for window to be released else that would have been a an unsafe release. Am I right?
Bad luck max
Merc def taking pointers from a professional hitman
Bottas mercedes contract extened after taking out both redbulls 😂
tbh i wanted to see alonso to sin
Mercedes new strategy  Step one: make sure all competition crash on first lap Step two: be proud of their accomplishments
Its funny how Latifi is ahead of Russel in standings... For 2 points, and proly that wont change 😆
Ocon = Frodo Alonso = Gandalf
Mercedes team: we've a plan, who will mess up the race this time? Bottas: i will  Lewis: thanks mate
Bottas : execute team order
Absolute horror for Red Bull?  rather it seems like a sabotage for the pilots.
Alonso holding Lewis down for his teammate coz that's what heroes do
that commentator is completely over the top
I'm sure Hamilton is now seriously thinking about retiring after being that exhausted from a race
Poor max, crash in two races in a row while his opponent gain much points from the advantage
crashgate 2.0
Vettel got robbed 😕😭
All Bottas has to do is crash with Verstappen couple more times to get next year contract.
Valtteri it’s James take out max and you can have the seat next season
Its like every time we go to Hungary, a team at the back of the grid impresses, last year it was Haas, now, Williams!
Nice shot Valtieri Bowlas !
You have to feel for Verstappen he has been taken out 2 races in a row by a Mercedes getting barley any points
Latifi gets his first point for Williams 2 seconds before russel lol
Only 5 grid penalty for taking out almost half of the field, meh...
Are we supposed to pretend this just happened
Is no one gonna talk about Williams getting points??
Well done Ocon and team! Love to see the under dogs win!!!
Bruh imagine the nightmares in the redbull garage. We expected Lewis to get the  others...but Bottas did it lol.
Dislikes must be dutch
formula 1 virou meme, cada corrida 1 tira o cara da disputa e fica por isso mesmo
red flag at lap 1 O.O
FIA is a joke nowadays. There are so many things they should penalize drivers/team for which they don't, but to disqualify Seb for not able to provide sufficient fuel sample. That takes away all the hard work a driver produced, meanwhile the torpedo bottas only take grid penalty for taking out 5 cars effectively. I swear I will stop watching the sport if they don't sort themselves out properly.
#4 on trending y'all
Nice, next time RedBull should re-hire their mighty slav torpedo to challenge Merc Finish Torpedo, KVYAT
Finally, Duo Williams Get Points
They disqualified Vettel vs 5 Grid Penalty for Bottas .....Are you still believing that f1 is not really scripted?
Toto (During difficult Contract talks): Tells us Valtteri , why should we stick with you instead of Russell  Bottas (after taking out both Red bulls): Believe me Toto, Am best team player there is you can ever find
felt like such a weird race
Why Mercedes???
Bottas thought his still playing Mariokart
Schumacher showed some strength today, excited to see what he drives like in 2-3 years
Wow Hamilton last week and Bottas this week at the very start of the race. Can it even be argued at this point that mercedes isnt intentionally cheating to beat out the competition now? How is this allowed?
Mercedes can't beat Red Bull on a race anymore so they resort to taking everyone out so Lewis can get some points.
What a lucky accident for Lews. Too lucky.
Toto wolff did it Flavio Style
Vettel was DSQ
Congrate Ocon !!! From Mcralen fan ...🥲
Merc theme song: "One way or another, I'm gonna get you....
Alonso should get world championship title if he drive in mercedes or redbull car... 😁😁😁😁😁😊😊😊
Man, I’ve always been underwhelmed by Ocon, but genuinely was surprised and impressed by how cool he was under all that pressure nearly the whole race! Amazing feat to not make any mistakes and get the win.
Vettel got disqualified?
bottas definitely getting the new contract
Red Bull needs even More Cheese to go with their constant WHINING
Free seb
Funny how Max had a huge championship lead two weeks ago and two Mercedes erased that and took the lead 🤔
"Bottas took out both redbull cars" -Nico Rosberg 2021
alguien vio si lando Norris frena, gira la direccion o se va largo contra max verstappen y que motor lleva el mclaren ? trabajo de equipo. algún motor cae de free
No fue Botas, fue el loco de Norris , se le metió como demente a Botas y ya no pudo frenar. Nada más está causando destrosos
Alonso 😭😭💪
Well Bottas earned a bonus for this race taking out both RB's.
one of the craziest races
That solo start by HAM has to be the funniest I've seen in my 40 years of watching F1. The record was the 6 cars to start the 2005 US race.
Williams finally got some points😁
Bottas being a wingman once again. Now taking both Red Bulls out. I am so happy for Ocon but man.... I was so angry. Nearly thrown the remote.
Bottas has only one job to secure his contract for year 2022, create chaotic at the first corner and most importantly indirectly knock out the RB. What a race strategies!
listen to the voice of the commentator  when ocon won and  also williams both in the points marvelous race
Toto before the race be like: Vallterrri I want you to straight line t1 and hit the Red Bulls but make sure not to hit Loo-is and please make it look accidental, if not, I give your seat to George
How is Mazepin an actual driver!?!? How?????
bad strategy mercedez
hamilton the only one that didnt pit lap 1 cauze not dry enough  everyone else : hold my beer
Ocon surprise the lot probably due Alonso backing up Hamilton at crucial time of the latter part of a rain it track for start and Cars colliding at the start, bringing out the red flag and cars having to put early-ish......
That mist have been the longest wait for lights out ever for Ham. Just stewing in his error.
What an absolute farce.
Very interesting race it was.
The race was so much better than the highlights
Why Hammilton now its in 2 place
What does Hamilton have to do to win the driver of the day?
This race has everything: - Big crash - Red Flag - Wet tyre drama - Championship drivers charging through the field from behind - Aggressive wheel to wheel action - Great undercut - Great defense from slower car - Underdog winning the GP - and post race disqualification
This was one of the most exciting races ever! Stellar job by Ocon and Alonso. Alonso's defense was some of the best driving I've ever seen.    Hamilton also proved why he's, in my opinion, a better driver than Verstappen. Either one can win a race when they are up front, but this race proved that Hamilton is better at getting around traffic than Verstappen is. Hamilton came back from 11th to 3rd, and it probably would have been 1st if it hadn't been for Alonso, while Verstappen also ended up near the back of the 15 car pack and barely cracked top 10.
I still can't believe that Vettel was disqualified over lack of fuel left after a race, honestly the FIA needs to stop being bipolar with these penalty decisions
Driver of the day: bottas
Just a theory but does anyone else think that Mercedes do this deliberately. Bottas crash earlier this year allowing Lewis to do an extra lap under flag to catch-up, Lewis collide with max in weak spot 2 weeks ago and now bottas taking out both redbull cars this time.
I'm honestly just happy to see other drivers being able to compete for the championship. Having 1 driver dominate for years really makes F1 boring to watch. This is the best year of racing in a very long time.
Oh no! As Alonso made Lewis cry about dangerous driving, he probably will become the 66 order next target. Alonso must be careful with the Siths in Belgium! Be the force with you Alonso!  Sorry, but only the Star Wars fans will understand! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The only thing exciting in F1 is listening to the commentary. Like watching a completely different race 😂
Well Lewis Hamilton such a sux guy
Botas - should be banned for 3 races. British F1 Gang with MB hand in hand giving the title to POS Hamilton! So obvious!
Probably one of the best come back drives by Lewis Hamilton! He did not get the win but an amazing drive. Well done to Esteban Ocon, brilliant driving and  breakthrough win!
Bottas taking the idea of being a team player a little too seriously. 😂
Lewis 🤡
Nice strategy of Mercedes. Brilliant.
Congrats Ocon on the first F1 win in Hungary. Im pretty fired up on the standings, coz Lewis is back on the top! 😀 Though, Maxxie and RB will going to chase the leader in the next race to reclaim the title after the failed case in silverstone. To be fair though, having a powerful engine and some former staff of Mercedes GP to catch up is totally not enough. As Scrooge says in his childhood, "I must be tougher and smarter."
the fact that there are people who think lando was at fault for bottas rear ending him and taking out most of the top 6 is beyond me and a 5 place grid penalty is surely not at all enough for him next race.
This is the type of racing F1 needs to have on a more consistent basis
I saw memes of Perez with a kamikaze band before the race..  Pretty funny in the actual race Bottas takes out both redbull cars by himself.... 😂
we need an extended highlights on this so many things still missing
Can we get the full Alonso defending against Hamilton section?
Britain GP: Hamilton gets 10 Second penalty for dangerous driving which resulted in sending Max into the wall Hungarian GP: Vettel disqualified for missing 700ml of fuel ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
“Ok Bottas your goal is to be a bowling bowl” Bottas: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
Alonso  old tiger with excellent defensive skills  hold Hamilton  for that meny laps he deserve half Ocon podium
Drive to survive is gonna make this race into 3 episodes
Whoever saw the race live just witnessed history being made. Never had I seen a race restart like that 😂
Hamilton you beast 🔥🔥
All you need is a little rain and a big wreck to make an F1 race exciting
So was Bottas given the task to take out Red Bull?   His job is on the line from all the talk maybe he thought that by taking out both Red Bull competitors he might somehow redeem himself.
Mercedes q tranposos son y el segundo fracasado de votas se presta para eso
Bottas mission is to keep the rest out of the race and  to let Hamilton get all the credit that he dont deserve.
I see Mercedes has finally embraced their role as the villain in Formula 1
mazaspin
When Bono said to bottas that he must help Hamilton.....
Totto:  "Valtteri execute order 66"
KAMIKAZE BANZAI ATTACK!!
If I was the person who gives the penalty I would do: Vettel: no dsq Bottas and stroll: 10 place grid penalty And idk whether Russell onr counts as a penalty but I would have slowed him down less (if he didn't do the pitlane move he would have been P5, but he dropped to p7)
Incredible race from Vettel Ocon and Alonso without alonso covering of Hamilton like his life depended on it Ocon may of not won the race Lewis was massively closing up at the end. one of the best races of the decade for sure
Superb chaos which resulted in a great race. Alonso and Hamilton, flashback in Hungary 2007 🤣
Always keen on watching Hamilton being a GOAT on the tracks. Superb skills and comeback.
Tutu: Bottas, go eliminate other to help Hammy
How much longer is merc going to just get away with punting red bulls off of the track? It's sickening to watch this
BOTTAS is Finnish
Our boy George got points with Williams now!
I wonder, for some people, what LH would have to do to deserve some recognition. It cannot involve winning, because it will be the car, it cannot be not winning, because that just makes him a mediocre driver not able to win with the best car. We just hate you, that’s it.
Sebastian Vettel has been on disqualified due to low fuel sample in his car.
bottas mvp
Literal forza lobby
Eeeee stroll
Overtaking Difficulty: "Easy"  Alsono: "and I took that personally"
Valteri it's James see if you could take out the Redbulls.
Formula 1: Our drivers are the most skilled drivers in the world. Also Formula 1:  0:13
"Around the outside..." was used so much, I thought I was watching an Eminem music video.
This shows that Max will always be over aggressive against anyone. Still props to Alonso for the great race!
George Russel in the points. What a race
Mercedes maFIA.
Another race and another Mercedes driver cause an accident. Only bright spot was having a first time winner.
Alomso battling with Ham.  Best duels for the 2021 season.
that was my guess
hamilton: we need these points bottas: i will give you them
Now it's pretty difficult to choose between Hungary and Azerbaijan for the best race of the season (so far)
Seeing only one car starting the race:2005 USGP flashback
© Furious 🏁
Ahhh Mercedes strategy two races in a row
Alanso some how holding Hami back? Hes a great driver of course hes holding him back haha
Breaking: Bottas still the best wingman.
Lewis just barely escaped
i hope 2021 merc got nothing..because use dangerous strategy
BaBottas y los embiste a propósito.
Wow, that battle between Alonso and Hamilton was awesome. These guys put quite a show! Felt bad for Max for having his race compromised because of that crash.
Bottas.....................Ahhhhhhhhhh！
Hamilton crashes Max out - 10 second penalty Bottas crashes Perez and Norris out, damages Max's car - 5 place grid penalty Stroll crashes LeClerc out - 5 place grid penalty  Seb has 0.3L of fuel left instead of 1.0 after finishing second - DQ THAT MAN   This year's F1 is becoming the crowning jewel on the shitfest that Hamilton's career was. I hope he wins the championship this year and leaves already so we can have a normal racing experience going forward. I'm sick and tired of this.
One more lap and Hamilton could've won 😞
2:00 this Russell move is too giga chad for even the race stewards.   I swear when they played this replay beer came out of my nose.
Damm Alpine...such a great race for them all
2:24 mazepjn deserved lol
Mercedes Masterplan because hamilton world number 1 driver.hamilton cannot accept defeat
Can´t wait to see the memes of Hamilton lonely restart and Bottas strike!
Guys, that's what you waiting for the whole season: Mercedes and everyone can now really blame Valtteri for this. Karma for all I would say 😝
That’s how we call a wing man
Super super Hamilton!! :))
Team orders from Mercedes to knock out both Red Bull drivers LOL.
Alonso is the best in history un f1
Just a thought. There was such a rigmarole about Hamilton supposedly crashing into Verstappen and putting him pout of the race in Britain. But today we see Alonso banging into Lewis, and Mac knocking Schumacher out of the way. So, Max doing the hitting and Lewis being hit. Let's look at that footage from Britain again shall we???
The amount of damage Stroll/Mazespin have caused so far is greater than my target retirement corpus :D
Hamilton the only one at the restart kinda sums up how 2020 is , F1 is about him alone🤣🤣
Execute order 66
Bottas you cheat you should not be in F1
When Seb gets disqualified, it's "unfair"  Rules are rules
Try to convince me that Hamilton Is the GOAT After this ahahahahha. Try it
Lewis thought he could bully Alpine… oh no señor said Alonso!!!
George Russell's pit lane start tho lol
"Valtteri it's James, crash into a car for Hamilton's lead"
5:48 why did they both have their wings open? I feel like Sainz shouldn't have
Bettas sacrifices himself to take out the Red Bull’s… nauseating
Stroll do the idiot thing
Get in there,Bottas
GET IN THERE OCON
So they did let Grosjean drive a Mercedes
mercedez is lucky bcoz alonzo cars slipped
holy so many crashes
Seb has been DQ'ed!!nooooooo!!!!!!
Bottas: "Hey Toto let's go bowling!"
Justice for Vettel
This is also Williams first point since 2018, what a long long time
Jesus stop screaming
Lewis: I can crash Max Bottas: Challange excepted
seb :(
A vergogna di tutti i piloti. Partire in griglia da soli ed arrivare dietro.
I think It was the best race at Championship
Fernando alonso legend track formula 1 💪💪💪
Vettel has been disqualified for not having enough gas in his tank to give a sample for testing.  Just unfortunate in my opinion. that actually promotes Hamilton into second and increases his points difference with Max
Bottas is NOT F1 driver.
Bidone d'oro and Tapir d'oro goes to Sainz who thinks he knows tactics better than his race enginereer
Race Engineer: "Valtteri, it's plan D"  Bottas: D must be for Demolition? "Say no more"
Bottas well done 🤣🤣🤣
What Ocon's dream last night? 😂😂😂 Very Fantastic race , Chaos on first lap  , Schumi first point and Alpine i hope to be Double podium there , ahh..... So Enjoyed 👍👍👍
FIA ajudando LH apagando as luzes rápido.
should be big penalties and fines for the crashes in lap one
When sainz was running 3rd lewis was 7th and charles was out… also every time seb was on the podium with aston stroll was out..?!?!
It is great to see seb back on the podium and also seeing seb say that he is disappointed for 2nd place I think we are seeing the vintage seb now
Another "racing" butler's to the perfetto. This silver banquette team is hilarious 😂. F1 racing on the edge of new design. More Drama they wish, more Drama coming indeed. 🤣
2003: alonso wins with renault 2021: ocon wins with alphine
Hamilton=2021 Champions
"Valtteri it's James" Ultimate version. This season is a joke
Merc's new upgrade is made for Bottas: the Bowling Ball upgrade. It works like a charm.
Yes Ocon wins is first birth ever grand prix in formula 1 hungary 2021 for last season and team renault alpina tech 3 is winner comeback i cannot believer me
Bottas contract is safe forever
OCON!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 IM SO PROUDDDDDDDDDDDD
Congrats to Esteban Ocon!!!
Porquería de f1 mandaron a botas a pegarle a los red bull
Hamilton's luck is starting to get really annoying. It seems like no matter what happens - this guy is always the beneficiary.
Bottas taking out both Red Bull "Traditions" - Bottas
Bottas did one WORST than any Maldonado movement ever.
I really dislike Ocon for absolutely everything he did in Racing Point, but at this point I'd rather him to get P1 than Hamilton.  Also, Alonso showing once again he's an excellent driver. 💎
That's how it is when MERCEDES is not dominant easy win. Than valterri takes em out easily
IT'S LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY HE GOES
Vettel is originally finished second but now he is disqualified
Interesting srategy by merc side  Also merc : give those wingman a lifetime new contract
Botas help hamilton
HAM is like a little child always complaining when things don't go his way, an absolute sore loser spoilt golden child. Get over yourself
Nice editing though 😅: Missing Transition Coincidentally Alonso's first Win back then
BREAKING NEWS: Bottas secures 2022 contract after amazing first lap drive.
fired Bottas Mercedes, ban Bottas and your super licence
So nobody gonna talk about the Mercedes team literally causing accidents to hold a lead in the Championship? That’s two in a row.😂
Fact: if Hamilton was the one who crashed again, the future of F1 would be very different
Lewis, how do you and Merc win this year championship? Well we crashed them out direct and indirectly.
Vettel loses second-place finish in Hungary after disqualification for fuel sample issue
So now Vettle is being disqualified it sure seems like F1 is doing everything it can keep Hamilton and Benz at the top I no its not tru but sure feels that way.  I love F1 them I hate F1.
It’s disgusting how so many people can cheer for a no skill driver like Hamilton. Put him in a ride like Räikkönen, Alonso or Vettel and you’ll see his performance tank even worse than these drivers.
Of all the days to be out of reach of Internet. Imagine looking up Hungarian Grand Prix at 8pm and seeing OCON won. 😳 I'm late to the comments but a I have 2 observations; *Sainz had an amazing battle with Lewis and no one has mentioned it *Even with so many top cars out of the race and with a 3rd place Constructors car Daniel Ricciardo still could not manage a decent place.
Bottas best wingman ever
I am upset for George.  the man scores his first points in a Williams, isn't even the lead Williams, and there are about 6 other stories about this race that are bigger deals.
Alonso single handedly saved the race from another Hamilton win. Mans insane. Also well done Estaban!!!
Both Williams Got Points noww. Congrats to ocon
Mercedes will make Lewis champion one way or another
Coincidence?? Two weekends in a row, and we have a new leader…
Mercedes is a shame for Formula 1
Supernatural editior got this down to just over 7 minutes.....
Alonso. The true GOAT of his generation.
Toto: "...like hockey enforcers!" Bottas (the team-player): *light bulb*
Jesus mercedes really can't stand having competition. May as well just wreck everyone every race at this point. And Toto has the gaul to call Red Bulls statements "below the belt". As your drivers wreck the championship leader 2 weeks in a row....
(MA)FIA + MERCEDES + HAMILTON = DREAM TEAM
Botas has done it specially, no dought,  not fair play of mercedes
So no one talking about williams double points.
marcedes has new tactic for last two races...crash the competiton
Sebastian vettel had disqualified at hongaroring
if lap up to 73 surely win lewis hamilton,
What an entertaining race 10/10. Very scary moments with overtaking though with Hamilton v Alonso. Race also helped distribute constructors points across the field, hopefully 2022 cars will bring similar competition in the dry also. Glad to see Williams and Russell in the points too.
Ban Shitercedes.
Where's max?? 🤣 P10th? 🤣
"Bottas just took out both Red Bull cars." Uh huh. sigh. I'm sure they were all cheering back at MB HQ. Red Bull/HONDA: "THIS IS BULL****!"
Alpine as done an outstanding race. Ocon was clean as few were, but the fight of the season was Alonso against Hamilton a brilliant drive by Alpine. Finally this is getting much more competitive with a few teams that can win races as well 🙏.
ボッタスとしはいいレッドブル潰しになった！ メルセデスとしては称賛ものだろうね❗️(笑)相手のマシン潰せばポイントともくそも無いからね❗️ 代償はグリッド降格だけで済むから、(´･∀･｀)これこそ、ダメージリミテーション、(笑笑)
1:19 Car number 44 serving 190 seconds penalty after taking out 19 cars.
Commentary is awful
Mercedes engine insane..
Bottas: "Can those 3 car's overtake me?" Mercedes: "I send you a email" Bottas: "ok, i did care of it" Mercedes: "sign this contract plz" Bottas: "only 1 Year?" Mercedes: "yes" Bottas: "But i striked 2 Bulls" Mercedes: "2 years it is"
I never knew how the highlights don’t do the race justice until I was able to watch live this year. This one especially.
fantastic ！素晴らしいレースをありがとう❣️
thank you, Bottas
If Alonso release Hamilton at lap 63, it would be a threat for Ocon in winning his 1st race
Is this the first points finish for Rusell?
Seb got disqualified after the race
what a race man
I dont care of Ocon wins, I just want Hamilton to lose.
Why the F*** is Rosberg commentating?
Again, interesting tactics by Mercedes for advantage in points.
Davide brivio
solid team mate
This was probably the most entertaining race of the year.
Bottas is officially the best teammates ever. Ready on a moments notice to take out the entire field and ensure LH gets the lead in the championship. I'm afraid it's a little too late for VB, as they've probably signed George.
Alonso was getting Schumacer at Imola vibes
Le está dando resultado a Mercedes en dos carreras estaban muertos y ahora con las artimañas ya van en primer lugar.
😍👍🙏🇨🇵
Funny how no one is complaining about repairing the car in the red flag
Jesus Christ, what does a man who wins the race have to do to get more credit? Alonso helped for sure but the kid won the race, big him up instead of Alonso the entire time...
This commentator ultimate hype man
Toto Wolf is so proud of Bottas for the Strike on RBRs
This was without a doubt the most exciting F1 race I've seen so far!
vettel got robbed
This is like F1 2021 braking point story mode 😮😮
I think this is Valteri’s last season with MB after that disaster.
Bottas is the GOAT of 2nd drivers
is that Nico with commentators ???
What have I watched? Bottas didn't just take both red bulls out after losing position at the start to help Lewis win the championship.
*Bottas' renowned bulldozer skills*  :-D
Bottas brake's just gives up in the first lap lol
Lewis is so boring. I wish him well but he has made the most boring racing in 30 Years.
Just boring and boring to watch the F1 race for now......
Botas intentionally did it
Mercedes "We will crash out both Red Bulls...we can never lose" What a joke F1 has become
1:19 is pretty much the F1 for past 5 years or so
Is anyone going to mention the great commentary?
botas is a real piece of work, what a joke
0:37 : "Bottas took out both RB there".. . .  . could this be part of a strat???
Hamilton being alone on the grid makes him look like a smart kid in the class who other kids try to avoid to be around.
does lewis want an extra quali or what
Max crash into someone else on the outside again! thats aggression
Mercedes causing crashes two races in a row now
"Valtteri Its James, Execute Order 66" "Yes Mi Lord" Lando : "Its BROKEN ITS BROKENNN" :( Emperor Toto : "Everything is proceeding as i have forseen >:)
Look how fast the lights go out when Lewis was the only one to start on the grid. I challenge you to show me a video of a faster lights out. 🤔
Vettel disqualified 😥 i hope an appeal is made soon..
Of course Bottas takes out all the competition excluding Lewis...
Is it just me that proud for the williams getting their first point
Bien calculado el golpe de bottas para dejar fuera a los red bull. Deberían castigar a los Mercedes ya llevan dos carreras haciendo trampa.
The great teamwork of Alpine Today is one of the best thing in this Grand Prix
One of the most exciting race in 2021 👍🎉
bottas hizo el trabajo sucio de mercedes  .....bueno creo que con eso ya aseguro su contrato para la proxima temporada .... puff que mal se esta viendo mercedes al hacer trampa ....pero no se lo hicieran a ellos por que ya estarian ldrando contra red bull ...... me pregunto donde estan las autoridades de la F1  que no vieron nada raro ...
Fun fact bottas =botass
fun fact that sebastian vettel got disqualification
Toto: "Bottas this is Toto, activate Baku 2018" Botta: "copy that"
Bottas : I'll do anything to keep my mercedes seat Toto : Anything? Bottas next race :
I'm very happy for Max Mazepin for getting 1point 👏👏👏
Bottas takes out both red bulls
Welldone for Davide Brivio 👏👏👏
What a race... Congrats to Esteban for his first ever F1 race win! Especially to the Alpine F1 team. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
The last two races have had so much excitement and drama. So entertaining.
Alonso could become a great CB
The whole Mercedes team should receive at least a 2 race suspension.
Stop racing Ricciardo
Lets go Sebbbb!!!!! wohhhhhh!!!!
No Vettel has been disqualified! He had less than a litre of fuel 😭
Toto : Redbull is one DNF away from us. Bottas : Say no more.
Wow congrats esteban and vettel.
That was the crazy race  for me and looks crazy for the commentators 😁but what the race it was. As expected Lewis was on fire from top to bottom to third place.... 🎉🎉🎉
George, hello it’s Toto. Just calling to let you know we’ve extended Valteris contract.... yes, yes you’re a better driver but he’s better for Lewis!
noisy commentary, Nico is a better commenter
Well this was disgusting !!!!!!
the time has come...execute order 66 Bottas: Yes my Lord
The Diva's Hamilton nightmare FERNANDO ALONSO 👍👍👍👍👍. This is what I want to see every week in F1 all teams fighting
People : Checho has to take out lewis in Hungary That one devoted wingman : Gonna take out every one in front of me, except my team mate. For The Team!!!! Goooo!!!!!!!!!
bottas really trying to secure his seat for next year i see
Hamilton blundered by not pitting too. 😆🤪😜
Has anyone ever started a race alone?!
Just look at how Max elbow-ed through Schumacher’s car.
Merc responsible for taking out three red bulls in two races.
Master snooker play by bottas
OCON🤩
is lewis ok
Tough luck for redbull in hungary
So that's how Bottas bargain for the new Mercedes contract?
Valtteri this is James, execute order 66
Bottas:What happened at the start?  Norris: You asking what happened at the start? If I don't go to the left you crash into us and we all three go out. You came in like a torpedo.  Bottas: Yeah but it was racing.  Norris: Yeah racing but if I keep going the same line, we'l crash.  Bottas: Don't keep going. Norris: Yeah but there was a car on the left also.  Bottas: Yeah like I can see all three cars man come on. I only have two eyes, two cars.  Norris: You crash if you do it like that. Bottas: But we didn't so Norris: Yeah you didn't, you were Lucky this time.
Bottas kinda SUS
I can’t tell if this means the end of Bottas at Mercedes or if he just got himself another one year contract.
What a chuffin' race.
Mercedes just threw away a golden opportunity. What a shame.
How to make a race interesting?  Bottas: we crash
Lewis crying to his team about Alonso’s dangerous driving was the best part of the race for me, thanks Fernando
Hamilton crying for the crow booing  but  he donot care about  borras crashing Max. Mmmm is funny hear a kid crying.
Thought after restart Hamilton was down to 14th place, but I believed he could finish within 5 to 7 level but it's an excellent technic he finished with level 3 😁gr8 skills
Instead of making fun of Bottas or being angry at him for taking multiple cars out, I want to thank him for giving us a race we will remember for a long time. Without him this race would have been a boring parade with Lewis, Max and himself crossing the finish line in that order.  Thank you Bottas!!!
Mercedes again fishy moves by bottas
Bottas just secure his seat in Mercedes for 2022
Seb unhappy i'm unhappy 😢
Mercedes have been focusing on their kamikaze training recently.
SUCIOS de Mercedes
This Commentator what a JOKE!!!
Canada 19 flashbacks intensify
Can you believe some idiots actually believe the Mercedes is weaker this year? Can't wait for 2022, hopefully F1 will get rid of this dreadful tyre approach.
Great race
maF1a
Mercedes intentionally wrecking redbull out of the race. Two races in a row. Anything to protect their token.
First off, gutted for Vettel after driving to great second place.  I must say it was kinda surreal seeing Lewis being the only one line up on the grid at the restart. Ultimately it was the wrong decision but it was something to see
Mercedes lap 1 tactics on another level
がっかり フェルスタッペンを潰しにかかっている
But why was Vettel DISQUALIFIED????
Bottas definitely gonna get the contract extension
Loved Alonso defending hamilton with a lower performance car. Certainly cost Lewis the time to overtake Vettel and ocon.  Proud to be a Alonso fan.
Yeahhh....mercedez again.
Crazy. Two races in a row a Merc takes out a RB
„Hi Bottas! Here is James. You need to make sure both Red Bulls will stay behind Lewis“ Bottas: Mission accomplished!
Congratulations 👍👏👏
The old Renault was awakened in that Alpine in this race, which was why Alonso was able to fight back.
Feel bad for Dan here. He was on track after a great start to get into 2nd there...until Lance Stroll decided to play Mario Kart and go across the grass.
The boss has to eat his words Just this week he said icon is not champion material
Stroll and Bottas better quit now and stick to Wreckfest online.
Bendiciones, Juan 3:16 (NVI).  Jesus te ama.
Blessings, John 3:16 (NIV).  Jesus loves you.
Taking out your main rival: 10s penalty Taking out 3 rivals in the first conner: 5 place grid penalty Not having 1L of fuel after the race: Disqualification! After this the FIA can deliver the title because they already decided the winner
Toto: Our first part in our masterplan is to get rid of the competition. But one teammate at a time and not make anyone suspicious  Hamilton and Bottas: Yes Sir!
Bottas gave a new meaning to "hammertime"
Com mais umas 3 a  5 voltas, Hamilton chegaria em primeiro !
With MV stuck behind, after restart, meant we watched refined, clean, sporty and skills packed driving. Not constant aggressive performance
Seems the only way Lewis can win anymore, is if Mercedes takes out RedBull on the first lap  ----- SAD state of affairs
Let say like in football term, Valteri is the man of the match.
This is F1 history
I AM SOOO DISGUSTED WITH F1! SO TO WIN A CHAMPIONSHIP YOU JUST HAVE YOUR TEAMMATE TAKE OUT THE LEADER OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP! JUST LIKE THE LAST RACE!!!
Russell finally gets points and gets beat by Latifi 😂😂😂😂
At least Hamilton didn't win . Thank you Alonzo
*everyone anxiously waiting for Verstappen's rematch against Ham*  "Valtteri, it's James..."
I swear... Max does not know how to drive wheel to wheel.   He hasn't learned.
Alonso 🔥🔥🔥
race of the year
Wolff: Botta!  Botta: order executed!
Everyone scared to start along Mercedes after bottas crashed anyone who overtook him.
1:20 this is the funniest thing I've seen in F1 in a long time 😂
Hamilton takes out main championship rival, 10 seconds. Bottas takes out 3 cars , grid penalty for next race. Vettel's car had only .3 liters of fuel instead of 1 liter, disqualified. " its a yoke, these rules are a yoke".
1:20 How the FIA wants their races to be
No one here giving credits to Carlos for getting p4 but eventually p3 cause of Seb DQ. Carlos rejecting to pit was a smart decision done by him
Funny how Ferrari yields on lap 67 to avoid putting mercedes out..
Mercedes' great Master🅱️lan
Great job Bottas. Great 10 secs move
Looks like Kvyat told Bottas some tricks to get revenge on losing his RB seat
What a sad race, Mercedes ruined it again.
Vettel NOOOOOOOOOO :(
happy to see my favourite team win :D
germany 2007
Could anyone please stop this noisy brat at the microphone? Please!
Madcedes Bentz
Interesting, unpredictable and weird race. Only Hamilton start from the grid😂
if Max and Ham retire race , the race is more interesting.
Bottas out russell in! Toto... I mean tatar
When lulu was hit by Raikenen he was crying on press conference claiming it’s staged
History was made in this race
Ahhhh if vettel had win!!!!
Fantastic driver from both Alpine drivers and Pierre snagging the fastest lap.  Top 10: 7 different nationalities 7 different constructors  10 different people  F1 is truly flying their slogan with this GP. This should go down as a text book example of what a "race" is and what "diversity" is.  Keep up the fantastic work F1.
Honestly they should just have Perez take Hamilton out every race at this point for payback
00:36 Commentators : "First corner, Bottas took out both Red Bull cars"  😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Did Russel actually break any rules ? I'd call that opportunistic clever racing.
very funny to see 1 car siting in the restart
Seb robbed again
Let's see Helmut re enact  this race.
buuuhuu verstappen fans
Ocon: Ey max! how about that? 😜
Great team work from alonso and ocon
Ocon like Alonso.
Everytime seb gets 2nd...stroll is out of the race...aston martin I have a plan
That was some shifty garbage 🗑️ from Mercedes
alpine wow.
ai que ser un poco mas profesionales y competir en la pista no con estas marranadas
Hamilton adesso è secondo, confido che anche Ocon venga squalificato così la Mercedes recupera la Vittoria. 😑
メルセデスが、又やってくれたよ！ レースをぶち壊してくれた。 まさかペナルティ無しじゃないだろうね？　FIAのお偉いさん！
Such a championship battle is ridiculous. To win this ridiculous battle, Redbull should hire torpedo again😂
Fernando Alonso is a true race car driver. Not a team robot. Ocon drove a brilliant race but Fernando deprived Mercedes of that win. Vettel was robbed of a great finish. Frankly,any team not Mercedes should turn off their engines and park their cars at the side of the track  right after crossing the finish line. Sorry, the FIA needs gas. Be a heck of a sight. All the drivers except Mercedes drivers walking back to the pits after the race.  A great race mangled in Mercedes favor by the FIA. Just give Mercedes the trophy now and cancel the rest of the races. Think of all the money saved.
Am I hearing nico rosberg as commentator
Mercedes ALWAYS crashes into other cars whenever they start to lose!! How PATHETIC are they??
I'm guessing Bottas has been watching too many replays of online sessions in the F1 2020 game
When Bottas was apologizing for his mess, where's Stroll? Oh wait, he was complaining Bottas created a mess. What a sore loser. He doesn't belong in F1.
F1 fans are the worst
mercedes impotente en las ultimas dos carreras jugando demaciado sucio ,es una verguenza que recurra a un juego demasiado sucio pa tratar de demostrar algo que no ah sucedido alo largo del campeonato, el mejor de el campeonato  es max verstapen y su equipo red bull
Alonso just turned 40 btw
DISLIKE REMOVE THE DSQ FROM VETTEL !!!
So Botas takes out both Red Bull cars! Hmmm 🤔🤔🤔🤔
ALONSO THE BEST 😎👍
Look at Bottas steering wheel when he collided, why he tried to go left? Can someone explain?
What a clown show.
Alonso amazing team player right there
6 Drivers Out Unexpected Ocon Win Both Williams drivers get First points of Season 1 car start Hamilton 1st to 14th to 3rd now 2nd because of Vettel Disqualification Insane Alonso defence One of the Best races of the Decade???
Norris: is the only driver to score points every single race and into the podium position once again Bottas: I'm gonna end this man whole career
Alonso would wipe the floor with Sir Hamilton if he had a Mercedes but instead a useless driver occupies the 2nd Mercedes car 😔
Kamikaze of the year
Mercs earning the hate.
Erm did lando touch bottas front right tyre with his back left tyre
I can tell this will be the best netflix Episode.
Amazing drive from Fernando, Ocon, Verstappen and the Williams boys
Stroll's incompetent, denied driving, clown buffoon must be disqualified for 10 GPs!
This video doesnt make its justice for the race we had today...
Surely a big grid penalty for Bottas in Spa?!?!?! Just pile driving like that affecting more than 1 car on a race start, first corner is a joke. Especially in those conditions.
Yay for Ocon!!!
Lewis Hamilton, yes..
10s penalty and 5 place grid penalty for making redbull get 0 points in 2 races + lots of $$$ for repairs is kinda great strategy to win the championship titles.
🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳🎳
Latifi (who capped everyone by being DENIED for driving), Stroll, Gasly, Bottas, Mazepin, Ricciardo (useless pilot!) cannot be in F1. Otherwise, everything is valid ...
2:20  Nothing new.  No one is gonna mention MazeSpin?
Hey Bottas want a job next year...take out red bull in the first turn, copy that toto...they took both red bull cars out how unfair..this sport is rigged f1 suxs now a days
Bottas has won the Title for the "Best team work."  Mercedes: Get in there Bottas!!!
Imagine getting a much severe penalty for not having enough fuel than someone who literally crashed into the entire front 3 rows
Man I fully expected either Hamilton to take someone out again or finally Carlos Sainz just says "fuggit" and takes out Hamilton.   Classic Mercedes come from behind. I mean Valterri, not Lewis.
I just want a Ricciardo podium... but nooooo.
Stroll : oh no there is Leclerc in front of me what should i do ?   After 10 second  Cut the corner go on the grass and destroy the race of Leclerc and Ricciardo Nice job Stroll
Mercedes Bumper cars for the win........... filthy stinking cheats...... if Red bull are going to have any chance they need to start getting their reserve driver to start raming the opposition
F1 should discuss DSQ bottas from every race which does not start on dry tires. That man is dangerously bad in wet conditions. (remembering imola and turkey)
when lewis didt pit lewis:where is everyone?
Toto: Valterri, you want a seat next year? Bottas: How can I help the team? Toto: Execute order 77.   Bottas proceed to ram 2 Red Bulls.
Give Bottas A big sigar... mission completed  and take the two Bulls out Toto. Now i get a new contract ?
Fernando Alonso activate 2010 Abu Dhabi Vitaly Petrov Mode.
Half these highlights should have been Alo vs Ham
Well served to Verstappen, really starting to show his immaturity as is Horner and the whole Red Bull team from the last incident at Silverstone.........Cry babies every one of them. His time will come to become Champion but its just that Hamilton should exit the sport with a record 8th win. Bottas pack yer bags m8 no seat for you next season not in a Silver arrow anyway.
Justice for Vettel! This is disgusting
Netflix viendo todo el material de esta temporada
I think lewis will win the championship . Most of the remaining tracks favour the Mercedes
Bottas fellowing the master plan
Ocon and Alonso's Team work is just amazing
Ocon Vai Festejar o Podium 😎🎇🙏
Tell me again Mercedes isn't trying to sabotage Red Bull
Jesus christ how many more times is the Mercs going to hit the RBs in this season
SAINZ
So Alonso is perceived to be great coz he helped the cause of all Hamilton haters!!!??? Alonso hates Hamilton very much and he won't wait to make anything to stop him from winning any day
Dear Bottas. You are the best second driver ever.
Alonso was almost godly in his defense against Hamilton. It was also rather funny hearing Hamilton complain about nothing because he couldn't get by.
JUST HERE TO SAY VETTEL GETS DISQUALIFIED AFTER THE RACE LEWIS GAINS P2 AND SAINZ P3
That was some real bonehead driving by bottas and stroll. Sim racing turn one stuff.
Another awesome race!
dude seeing lewis alone on the grid is FUNNYYY HAHAHA
Narração em português!!! Cadê??? 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
Took a few hours, but Lewis got past Vettel  Radio : Lewis, this is Toto, it's almost midnight. Keep pushing, We can still get Vettel
did I hear Dani?
Mercedes destruyó la carrera con autorización de la FIA
Wow Ocon P1, Seb P2, and both Williams scored points!
Mercedez Cheating again!!!!
Toto: Bottas, you know what to do! Bottas: this!  no wonder they calling him the best team mate in F1
This is how I drive in Forza online every time! 😉
Seeing slow cars (Alonso) defending the fast ones (Hamilton) like that makes me feel sorry for them, but that’s racing I guess.
Not at all unexpectedly by this point, the comment section is inundated with people saying that Bottas, out of his extreme team spirit and relentless drive to help Hamilton, caused that crash deliberately, even though it will cost his team a considerable amount of points and it's only by chance that he didn't take out Hamilton as well. Equally amazingly, the claim is that this will solidify his position at Mercedes rather than being an impetus for the decision to replace him. It takes a pretty special combination of a lack of understanding of the sport and toxic fanboyism for so many people to be seriously saying such silly things all the time. Seriously, grow up.
Alonso won it for Ocon
Honestly Alonso at 40 years old is way better than Schumacher was at his 40's
Vote or no Vote, Driver of the day was clearly Lewis because he completely dominated this highlight reel....or maybe I'm hearing things.
Vettel still cannot manage to win
Bottas: idiot  Max: bad luck Alonso: gandalf modus  Ocon: je suis un baguette 🥖
Fucksakes, first formula 1 race I miss as working a double shift and it's an absolute blinder, think it's fair to say gutted is not the word 😭😭😭
2003: Alonso wins his first gp in a French team   2021: Ocon wins his first gp on a French team
So happy for Ocon.
LOOK how absurd close Bottas is behind Norris...Toto Wolf said before the race; "We need to do something special at the start"...using Bottas as a bowling ball ?
Lance Stroll being... Lance Stroll.
I see more people acknowledging Alonso for Ocons win than congratulating Ocon for his fantastic drive. Yes Alonso helped out at the end but Ocon being able to keep a wdc like vettel behind for the entire race deserves more credit.
Wolf: Bottas,I need you to bumper car as many cars out of the race as possible..  Ok
Holding off a 4-time champion for the win is a godly!!!
Valterii it's James please take out both redbull cars
strategy of mercedes, hit the redbull car, lol..
at that speed. “It’s so dangerous man.”😅
No one talked about both Williams being in the points haha
Remember guys: Crashing a rival  into the barriers at 300km/h and sending him to the hospital will get you a 10sec time penalty Crashing into several world championship competitors of your teammate at 200km/h will get you a 5-place-grid-penalty Having 0,7l too little fuel at the end of a race gets you disqualified  gj maFIA
The best race of the season so far.  Williams score.points Red Bull Nightmare race Mercedes fight back Seb and ocon top 2 Norris,Bottas,Stroll,Perez,Leclerc,Mazespin out of the race.  WHAT A RACE!
schumacher racing verstappen and defending amazingly!!
Alonso: No heart feelings, mate  Hamilton:  I'm so proud of Ocon win, congrats❤️
The most entertaining race in recent memory.
Five grid spots but you only gave Hamilton 10 seconds for missing his breaking in the dry...
Now it’s only bad luck for Max, but just imagine if it was Max putting Mercedes car out in two races, what would it be said about him... I wonder
Mercedes must be made in a position not to harm. Thats enough!
Ojala pierda ya hamilton que aburrido es
I know my boy will change game, thank you Hamilton
Hamilton solito en la grilla, tal cuál Mercedes quiere. Qué sucios
Congrats Bottas. You can keep your seat next year. Great work! Best wing man ever indeed
"Valteri, this is James. Execute order 66."
stroll out here making f1 2021 the game moves
Bottas forced to protect pretty boy Hamilton after last race I see.
Netflix:  *Note That down, NOTE THAT DOWN*
Botta's last straw....the new torpedo. Out of Mercedes.
what happened to the camera here @3:19? is it some cancelled transition to a different camera? Im intrested what happens behind the scenes of a broadcast. excuse me.
Ocon: Wins  *EVERYONE LOVES THAT*
I like this game,  that's is all formula 1 about. Hungarian brings back formula 1 we use to see.
this really is the most rigged season in history
Totto: valteri que tanto quieres esa segunda plaza?  Valteri: si  Totto: chocar los necesarios para salvar esta compañía   Hamilton: valteri un crashgate  Valteri: renueven mi contrato y esta hecho
Hamilton 🐐
Bottas is getting so BAD!! Even his mother would drive better!! What happened to his self-esteem???
What a superb drive for both Alpine drivers, Ocon getting his first win but Alonso as well, great battle with Hamilton and if it weren’t for that, Hamilton would have not only caught Ocon but an amazing come from behind win.
Mercedes masterplan
Ridiculously: Again a Mercedes crashed into Verstappen!!
what would have happened if lewis pitted on the formation lap as well? extra formation lap?  with no car to start the race, when is pit road allowed to go?
レース後の計量行う前にハミルトンは水飲んでたのが映ってたのですが、あれはお咎めなしでしょうか？
How can Vettel get disqualified for being unable to give the FIA a fuel sample but Hamilton gets a 10 sec penalty for sending somebody into the wall going 180mph?
Alonso: YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!
I wasn't able to watch the first half of the race and turned it on at lap 44 and was so confused
What a beautiful strike from bottas. Sadly not the right sport 🎳 🎳
Mercedes strategy - Bottas causes as much damage as you can and Hamilton your escape so we will beat Redbull jsjsjsjs
Happy for Ocon  And so sad for Our Boy Vettel 😭
mazepin is a legend ahaha. cant wait for the memes on this one
Bottas to Daniil Kvyat “Did you like that torpedo?”  Daniil Kvyat “Yes!”
2 races ago: ocon p16  Now today: p1         And so Netflix :Hi there ❤👋
now if it were actually as exciting as this normally it would be worth watching more frequently again lol
heartbreak for Seb 💔
MCLAREN GOT ROBBED
Russel gets point!!!!!
I won't forget what FIA did to my boy Seb. This disqualification is a joke.
I thought Bottas was the best Wingman, Alonso proved me wrong :O
"The damage you can see on the car thirty three..." the rhyme in this 😅
Mercedes crashes out their competition to win the Championship
"It is dangerous at this speed" hypocrite!
that was really unexpected
Petition to have Seb's 2nd place given back to them！ Also, did anyone notice that DR was lapped by the team he lost? Oh sooooooooooo sad that both Red Bulls were basically taken out in turn 1 with engine damage to boot. Best race ever though!
Ugh.  Call me when Hamilton is out of F1.
What a pathetic race from the front-runners. Top teams really failed themselves on this one.
Alonso/Vettel  > Hamilton change my mind
1:17 focus your camera on that mercedes
Im just surprised that the Williams got points
MAGIC ALONSO
Mercedes hang your head in shame
Well looks like f1 drivers are playing forza horizon online too much. Pretty much an online session going on here.
This race didn't have a lot of battles on track. However, it was fanstastic !
Option B for Mercedes this weekend. Have bottas crash out red Bull.  Great Job.
SEB is going to win. Trust this.
Verstappen can kiss his driver's championship goodbye.
VETTEL WAS ROBBED
Mercedes team strategist? Marvin Heemeyer
Once again Mercedes took the red bulls out!
👏🏽😎
Fernando won his first race at Hungary and Ocon just won his first race as well and if u watch the race Fernando actually helped hold off Hamilton for Ocon
1:18 XD
Siete dei bastardi vettel se la meritava la 2
Cmon man can ver not even race clean against a fkn haas
Bottas le hace un strike a media parrilla(5 puestos de penalización) Vettel acaba la carrera con solo 0,3 litros (descalificacion) Como las penalizaciones no cambien idos despidiendo de la F1.
Mercedes: Takes out BOTH of the RB cars in the first corner. FIA: Yeah, thats just fine...  Hopefully somebody is gonna ram Hamilton next race.
Toto Wolff to Bottas at the start of the race: "Execute Order 63"... Bottas: "Yes my lord"...
Bottas is a champ for merc. I mean he took out both redbulls quick
2:21
Alonso's stellar defense was enough entertainment for the whole race, he was extremely aggressive yet also fair. I told my father that the only way Hamilton would pass him is if Alonso were to make a mistake. About 4 laps later that's exactly what happened with the Turn 1 lockup.
Bottas is out!
I am thinking the situation with George Russell in the pits somes up what would happen if lewis had pit with the others 🤔 the line up after taking new tires determine your position for the race🤔
So Vettel was DQ'd for lack of fuel...what a joke, he was DQ'd for wearing a Pride shirt. Doesn't penalize Mercedes (really) for causing accidents that take out their top contender. F1 is a joke.
Toto Lobo: Creo que Russell tendrá el asiento de Bottas en la proxima temporada.  Bottas: Veremos, veremos.
Mission succes Bottas.
F1 is getting harder to stomach year by year.
Lamentable ver esas alianzas ... Mejor regale le la copa a Hamilton ....
Why did Hamilton get drs enabled at 5:44 as he is clearly in front of the ferrari when it went on. I know its automated, but i guess its a weird ruling with the drs check is done before the corner not on the straight. Seems a bit silly when u see ferrari not allowed to catch up to the car ahead of him with drs on. googled the rules: "The zones will have only one activation point that will be placed before the last turn, and before turn 14."
James: Valtteri it’s- Valtteri: what do u want now James: get our championship lead back Valtteri: copy that
Bottas really is a lawn mower
I can't belive I've missed this race
The crash seems almost intentional. Shame.
Bottas is a really big idiot,...
Thats what happens when you try to win the race at the first corner. Big thumbs up for Ocon.
Hamilton starting alone is one of the weirdest things I've seen in F1 in last years
Ok forget what happened. Anyone can make a mistake. This can still be an exciting championship.. Ohhh. No forget it. Well if this is the way to win championships than its fine by me. I don't care anymore.. Luck is such a big factor in this sport..
Give Alonso a winning car.
Ah they didn't play Hamilton's amazing overtake on Tsunoda at T4, my favourite move of the race!
The Mercedes Master Plan: 1) Bottas take out the Red Bulls 2) Lewis starts a GP alone. 3) 2 stop and fight Alonso for 3rd.  End result: Williams in the points, Mercs on top in both championships, Ocon (Merc jr.) Wins his 1st GP.   ONLY FLAW: Russel independently helping his team mate.
Hamilton just looked so lonley at the restart
Lucas di Grassi : use pitstop for taking the lead George Russel : use pitstop for taking second place They both have an 999 IQ
Seems like no one talk about stroll divebomb to leclerc 🤣
Can someone tell me what happened with hamilton? I didnt catch at all why he fell so far behind from these highlights. Can't imagine it was only because he stayed out with 3-4 laps old tires? Really happy for Ocon and Alpine, i hope they show up around the top more often in next season.
Seb robbed
"valtteri it's james. we need you to kamikaze into the redbulls for lewis"
Wouhouu 🇫🇷 Un Français qui Gagne avec une marque Française. C'est beau et rare !
maFIA
Narration too hysterical.
Is red bull suing anybody?
The tin foil hats were well used today, I'm sure.
If you truly ask me, Lando Norris caused the big accident by accelerating like  crazy in the wet passing Bottas on his right and then getting right in front of him with surface spray Bottas unable to see much and braked hard locking his wheels which caused Bottas to end up in back of Norris,  dont just blame Bottas. Lando knew it had rained and track is wet and the grip levels are low, he passes like a rocket and then blocks Bottas.
Mercedes botas👎👎👎
Valteri got paid off
1:22 LOL
Hamilton gets a 10 second penalty for knocking out a car costing 1.6mil. Vettel is short a few milliliters and gets DQ'd. There is something seriously wrong with F1's rule book.
Hamilton vs alonso looked like the reignited duel from 2007.
Distasteful crowd. The man secured P3 from P14 dehydrated and on the 2nd hardest track to overtake. Put some respect in his name :)
Boats want to prove he is not usless for the team,  taking out both RedBulls  , definitely he will keep his seat now
Hamilton, Bottas, and the rest of the Mercedes team have proven that they are the worst and most despicable team in the world, playing off the other cars and forcing them to retire.
Knew Valtteri was desperate to keep his seat but never knew he was that desperate
Alonso's catenaccio defense helps Ocon a lot
Bottas LRPM QTP!!!!!!!
Interesting fact about the turbo-hybrid era:  You’re 5 times more likely to be wrecked when battling for position against a Mercedes than with any other car on the grid.
Que carrera tan desastrosa
Hamilton : its only alpine i can pass him in 1 lap  Alonso : hold my skill my old teammate
BOTTAS smashing up everyone to help Hammy win another world title.
maFIA Lewis get 10 sec for putting someone in the wall Vettel getting disqualification for not enough fuel and Bootas get 5 places penalty for the next race it’s getting clearly now maFIA
Couldn't be more proud of ocon I remember seeing him in racing point I knew something was special about him and he has proved it today hope to see him on the podium more
Great racing coming out of alonso and ocon great to see it
driver of the day ?...  Ocolton
Hmmn...I’m starting to question the hatred for Lewis is not just about winnings but something deeper and subtle 🎱🎱
So happy for Ocon! 😁
Bottas  does his job takes out Max , Checo Norris and Hamilton can’t win, Bottas must be very disappointed at him
my nerves
You deserved this esteban all we know you story 🙌❤️
News Flash: Mercedes Benz are to rename their f1 team to Mercedes Bangs.
LOL all the hamilton haters are saying bottas took out the redbulls on purpose !!! WOW imagine bottas being that brilliant to play snooker with an F1 car and banking in another F1 car to finish off 2 redbull cars............precision billards with F1 cars........brilliant !! What great minds these hamilton haters have 😁😁😁
Ocon won the race, Lewis and Mercedes are leading the  F1 WDC & WCC going into the summer break!   KARMA.....
Please don’t have NIico as a commentator for future races …🙏
Hamilton was AMAZING
Hamilton being the only one at the starting line was the best meme Ive ever srrm😂
Kvyat the torpedo, Max Crashtappen, Crashstor Maldonado and Mazespin existed before us.  Welcome to Bulldozer Bottas.
Mercedes: *crashes* Also Mercedes: *stonks*
What a race it was
I like Mercedes strategy by taking everyone out
Why is it that everytime a Mercedes driver runs out of talent...they magically run into a RedBull...or two...
Special agent Max sabotage Ferrari now Merc sabotage him.  Karma ?
The job did a fantastic guys (and Bottas too).
bottas billiards missile
Stroll.... no words. He's perfect for "Russian road rage".
George and Williams getting double points finishes and no one recognize it  Williams: Am I a joke to you
MAX 😭😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mercedes grande strategy.
0:26 - The Ferrari crashed because there was some guy name Richard Mille driving it instead of Leclerc. I think maybe her won the a seat in a contest or something.
OUAIIIIIISSSSSS OHHHHHHHHH  ESTEBAN OCOOONNNNNNNNNN 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭😱😱😱🟦⬜🟥
Bottas going for that contract next, showing he has the stuff!
Merc: This is the way! Bottas: This is the way!
Liked Alonso before love him now ❤
I had a nosebleed watching this
Curioso que botitas se fuera contra los dos carros de Redbull, Mercedes, marca de tramposos y.ouercos. igual que Hamilton, lo podrido de UK
Bottas please RETIRE!!!!
Mercedes really do "anything" to win over RB... this time they crashed both cars
“Highlights” and they completely left out half of Hamilton’s passes including the tsunoda one smh
Mercedes...."We want a challenge" Red Bull....."Challenge Accepted" Mercedes.....SMASH ALL RED BULLS!!!!
Mercedes is trash it always make red bull be out of race
well if you ask me that was intentional, now hamilton will have no competion for points..the strategy of wolf is selfish what a trash team..i hope mercedes gets the karma they deserve
That's a terrible reason to be disqualified !
1:20 we race as one
I.N.C.H.E MERCEDES...... las UNICA forma como sabe/puede competir es destrozando los carros de RED BULL...... ahora por culpa del BABOTTAS !!!!!!!!!
Happy for Ocon! This proly the best race of the season. 😁
Honestly seeing some of you guys making joke about Lewis is hurting . As you can see he has pushed  his car to the limit and almost fainted . Rather than getting appreciated you guys are just booing him
If that had been Lewis instead of Max barging his way past Schumacher (aggressively but fairly) at :245, the lynch mobs would've been waiting at the finish line.
Mercedes is a missile for two consecutive races...
0:26 Pure depression
should introduce artificial rain every so often...
Williams are looking at 10 points not 6 after Vettels DSQ...
Felicitatiòn to Ocon.First Win,Two Podium.😊
1 lap again, different result 😂
ALONSO is still much better than all drivers on grid.
Bottas cagou a corrida, que caralho!
Hamilton : Well how can we stop Red Bull, they so consistent this year ! Bottas : Just guess
valtteri it's james, we need to destroy red bull
Intentional
For me in the current formula one, the car is about 90% and the pilot is 10% of the performance. It means that all the work of a lot of people in the team is 90% and 10% relays just in one person. For me is enough. Because of that it is difficult for me to say who is the best pilot of F1, because the car and team can make a Big difference. The Mercedes car is quite faster than the other ones.
How many races have run this year without a first lap incident ?
Dear Santa all I want this year is Max as a F1 champion and Sebastian as a GP winner
I love reading "Bottas did this intentionally" comments xD Too many idiots
Team Mercedes
Way to Ocon!!!!!
Can someone explain to me why Hamilton stayed out? im a bit confused :/
bottas is definitely done.
Alpine did it, THEY WON A RACE.  I wonder where Ricciardo is................oh riiiight!!!
Now that is what I call a professional crash.
F1 is a f..cking joke.  Pay to play, Politics, Cheat to win... The FIA should be totally ashamed.
Hamilton is the luckiest man in the world. He is world class. But his tittle rival was denied a challenging race against each other by bottas’ mistake
Amazing how Verstappen taking a corner wide and pushing out another car (Schumaker) is suddenly OK. Am I the only one angry?
What would have happened if hamilton also would have been in the pitlane?  Would they show us an empty grid where the light go out just to then swing the camera over in to the pitlane to see all the cars starting from there?   Really funny and ive never seen anything like that before
🔊 “Valteri, this is James , did you get my email of your P45?”
Is that rosberg on commentary
This race was by far the most entertaining of the year
Stroll should be kicked out of F1. The only reason he has a drive is because of daddy's money!
*lance stroll momento*
Valtteri it's James  (F1 Theme Earrape version)
At the restart Hamilton must of thought he was on the simulator.
Both williams got a point, Estaban Ocon first wins in his F1 career and both Alpine in Top5, Seb in podium, Hamilton the only one on the grid during the restart..Thanks to Bottas. Hahaha.
Renault is back
USA 2005 : 6 Cars in Start Race Hungary 2021 : 1 Car In Start Race
Wow, its so refreshing to see and hear new names fighting each other for places on the grid. Man I wish every F1 race was like this.
1:19 this is what happened if you didn't read email from Toto
Bottas' move reminded me of Grosjean's crash in Spa. Its a joke he only got a 5 place grid penalty. Vettel also got disqualified after the race. Looks like the FIA wants the races to be like this: 1:23
Ferrari's biggest problem right now, pace with hard tires
ハンガリーグランプリは盛大に事故りましたなぁ…
I really don't know why I rage to hear the voice of NICO in the commentary !
Race ban for bottas
So no one talking about Max’s dangerous overtake where he could have killed someone (sarcasm) no idea why people were so butthurt over an accident in an extreme motorsport. No one goes out there to hurt anyone, accidents are bound to happen at such high speeds where there are such small margins of error
Just dumb luck for ocon🙄
Toto: Alright Valtteri maybe there might be one last thing you can do to safe your seat at Mercedes for the upcoming season...  Bottas: Tell me master! It’ll be a pleasure for sure!  Toto: Get in there Valtteri !!!
Vettel P2, i dont care what MaFIA says
Pero que justo que Bottas saca a los dos Red Bulls No ?
What a horrible start but this was the most interesting race in months tbh
Hamilton: "Bottas, do u want a seat in Mercedes next year?"  Bottas: "Right away Sir Lewis!"
Great race and great results for Alpine and Williams, was for aston martin. Woolf needs to learn when he or someone in his team has made a mistake. His driver almost collapsed due to the unnecessary energy he expended trying to get back from their bad call at the restart.
It's not enough that Mercedes have a power advantage, now they're wrecking the competition. RIDICULOUS
The French at the end 😬😬😬
Is it just me or am I not the only one who is getting tired of not seeing a fair fight between Max and Hamilton anymore. I just want to see them race without any damage or other stuff.
When you have people pull in front of you of course your goin to RUN into the rear.
Hamilton : it's hammer time!!  Alonso : you shall not pass
Extended highlights pls
Fans:Wants Hungary to be an exciting race  Hungary: SAY NO MORE
So Bottas takes out Perez and Norris (who then collides with Verstappen), whilst Stroll takes out Leclerc (who collides with Ricciardo). And to make it even better, Raikkonen takes out Mazepin in the pits. Fantastic, this is the best F1 racing I've seen in a long time :D.
As much as I hate that the Red Bulls got taken out, and as much as I hate that it’s a Mercedes that took them out, I have to say, that was a stellar drive from Hamilton.
Alonso driver of the day protected his partner
What a great race.  I could never have predicted that result...
When I first saw the start I did a double take it looked like a freaking video game
Bottas was like; crash  1 RB and get one for free
Are we not gonna talk about how George scored points
Netflix watching this 🤔👀
Hmm? Two racing incidents caused by Mercedes drivers which result in damage to Red Bull cars??
Hamilton haters who says it is the car not the driver better see this.
If you can't beat them just run them of the road. Merc new strat is flawless.
The Mercs Master 🅱️lan has been nicely executed, look how the standings now, both the driver and team constructor is on the Merc's hand. What a way to end 1st half season
Lewis, it's hammer time!  Valterri, it's bowling time!   Sorry for that...  So hate me but I like Merc and Lewis!  Nice battle with Alonso btw. We need a full version of that.
Has anyone realised that Alonso also got his first win here, with Renault (alpine) nearly 20 years ago!
Hamilton still the best driver out there by far.
They really try EVERYTHING to make mercedes champion.
Meanwhile in snooker table James : "Valtteri its James, hit the red ball" Valtteri : "You mean Red Bull"?
karma for mercedes from next GP : on
Take a shot for everytime you hear "Hamilton"
please man no more SCREAMS, no more yelling, it is not necesasary, it is ANNOYING, my EARS BLEED, thanks please thanks.
MaFIA
I’m sorry, can we appreciate Hamilton closing a 7 second gap to Vettel within 3 laps
Not to take away from Ocon's win today with brilliant defense on Seb but Alonso was 50% responsible for that. Also, are we seriously just going to ignore the fact that Hamilton went from P1 to P14 then climbed all the way back to P3? Regardless of what anyone says you gotta admit that's brilliant driving, what a beast
THIS RACE IS AMAZINGGGGGG
For me Alonso is the best on the grid, he knew how to stop Hamilton for more than 10 laps and managed to get his teammate to stay in 1 position even with much less powerful cars.
You know the meme “it’s Bottas fault”?  Yeah i think that’s over now
Bottas went full on LEEEEEEEROY  JENKINS!!!!!!!
Wait is that russells first ever points !!!
Winning is one thing, fighting with titans is another.  alonso had a revision of his front driving skills today, just a brush up needed to win or even fight for championships,win will come....  Big congrats to ocon to keep everything together and get that win.  What a combo for alpine.....amazin
what a race
He owes Alonso a beer
Defenitely championship lead earned on track... kind of
My opinion that crash with Bottas was on purpose I'm sorry that's what I saw..
Verstappen doing exactly the same thing as he did in last race, but this time he got lucky.
Lewis is simply the best... that guy got HEART.  Go Lewis !!!!!
Looks like “Hammer time” doesn’t quite work on bottas.
More race commentary from Rosberg please. A great race and great commentating today!
Guys seb has been disqualified for an insufficient amount of fuel
Latifi for Mercedes confirmed. He beat Russell last year in final standings and will also win this year. Just saying a fact.
I swear - Hamilton's race engineer has made so many poor decisions this season already, you'd think he's working for Red Bull.
Hamilton; I took him out last race, now it's your turn Bottas; k
👏👏👏👍👍👍💙💙💙
1:18 alone kk
Eleven months after Pierre Gasly's amazing win in Monza, today is was Esteban Ocon's turn to win a Formula 1 Grand Prix in Hungaroring 🙂😉 In addition Hungary some notable drivers they won their 1st F1 win in Hungaroring (Hill 1993, Alonso 2003, Button 2006, Kovalainen 2008 and this year Ocon). Note this I have the same age with the Hungarian GP (I born July 1986) 😊😀
Mercedez what a cheaters , everybody happy because Bottas took out both Red bulls. This is no nascar you idiots
ボッタス… それはあかんわ
Another day another steal by Mercedes. This championship is completely distorted.
No one is going to talk about Red Bull’s 1,8 pitstop 🤯
Verstappen fans the last 2 weeks: 'Perez or another RB driver needs to take out Hamilton. Hamilton needs to be DQ's'  Bottas takes out both Red Bulls and Vettel gets DQ'd. Wonderful.
Thank you Alfonso for actually racing Ham Samwich. Needed some part of a race after Bottas Bowling
Here is what happen when 2 formula one world champions are fighting! Clean and beautiful battles! Both drivers where clean and respectfull.
Valteri? Is Toto. Execute Order 66
Bottas: *caused a 5 car crash at turn 1 Kvyat: ehhh I could've do that better Maldonado: pfft Amateur
Mercedes team idots
MAFIA
Valteri "hey Lewis" Lewis  "what" Valteri  "bet I could crash better" Lewis "how" Valteri  "watch"
Bruh that first corner lol
lol what a mess!
Called MAD MAX for a reason !
Que maravilla ver conducir a Fernando / me recuerda mis mejores años viendo la F1... 🤜🤛
Last race Hamilton took out one red bull. This race Bottas took out 2!
Alonso could've been on the podium if he hadn't been busy stopping Hamilton, served him right.
Vettel got robbed ... So unfair... MaFIA...
Lewis again beating max by max being attacked by a merc. love it
Toto's Trade offer: I recive: carnaged red bulls You recive: contract
If I see another fanboy complaining about Alonso without remembering Abu Dhabi 2016 I'm gonna lose it lol
The restart gives me US 2005 vibes....
Anyone remind me where Ocon started originally?
Lance Stroll being clueless as ever.......
Williams : Fail to score 1 f***ing point since Gigakubica in Germany 2019  Also Williams : Scoring 6 points in one weekend  Nicky and GEORGEEEEEE YEAH
Vettel disqualified: shameful. Bottas 5 place penalty: shameful. You're more politized than the Prost Suzuka incident.
Mr. Alonso vs Hamiltooons (stinky)
Engineer: Valtteri did his job of helping Lewis winning WDC! Toto: Great! How? Engineer: By making a mistake
"At this rate everyone is going to box this lap"  Mercedes need Russell.
Bravo LH magnifique dépassement.
Bottas did it on purpose. It's too obvious
It seems Mercedes have determined they are no longer faster than Red Bull and can't win, so instead of racing them, they take them out of the race
One of if not the best race of the season, exciting from the start to the finish, on a track where overtaking is so difficult - hats off to hamilton for reeling them in one by one, until he came up against alonso, the battle between them was epic. Hamilton may not be the most popular driver at the moment but he demonstrated why he is the best.
Karma for red bull after the disgusting way they treated Lewis and toto
Wolf : bottas, you want that seat really bad? Bottas : yes Wolf : then, be our hitman Bottas : my pleasure
What about Max, was he hard done by again this week??
Toto: Valteri you can keep your seat, but i have to ask for a little favor. Valteri: Count me in! The little favor:
Why they didn't show the full battle between Alonso and Hamilton??????????? It was the highlight of this race. It was Beautiful racing, it was standing straight in front of the TV racing. Why they didn't show the full battle????
Vettel was disqualified for fuel sample issue😢😢😢
Best race this season
Bottas: Mission accomplished...
Bottas: Misson passed
i didnt watch the race but can someone explain to me why verstappen couldnt comeback like lewis did? Did he have a problem in the car or what?
5 place grid penalty is a joke
6 OFF SIDE NEVER BEFORE!!!!!
Did Ric have damage or anything? Why tf was he so slow
Mercedes: Bottas, you now get a pay rise
Es una mafia la F1 !
Dsd 🇲🇽 bottas es un Cobarde y Mercedes NO tiene Nombre, Vergüenza Mundial de Antideporte 😠🤬😠🤬😠🤬😠🤬💪
Verstappen on alonso was the same as Hamilton and verstappen at Silverstone but no one got wiped out, I like max but he's aggressive and needs to accept it back when it happens
"Bottas takes out both red bulls" Toto wolf : 😏😏😏
what has happened to Daniel ? really sad to see
MF BOTAS DID IT ON PURPOSE!!!! SAW THE 2 REDBULLS, AND FLORRED IT!!!
It really worked out perfectly for Alpine today Ocon leading with Alonso just under a pitstop behind so he could hold people up
MAFIA. FORMULA 1 IS THE WORST THING IN WORLD SPORTS
Ocoooooon
MaFIA
Formula1 was actually more fun with real fans only. You got to increase revenue but, quality over quantity, people! Look at all the conspiracy theory maniacs you’ve attracted to the sport now.
Max can’t even race with a rookie😂
Mercedes deserves some points penalty for the amount of times they have sabotaged Red Bull in the first lap
Today was finally the day, where Max could have tried to unlap himself again when ocon passed him, just to crash into Ocon. Who remembers 2018? 😝😝🤣🤣
From 14th to 3rd with no clear advantage...poor sportsmanship aside, Lewis Hamilton is truly a genius on the track. Mindblowing.
Believe me, it is mercedes strategy
They have taken Vettel out of the podium. Hamilton will be 2nd now. Is it coincedence????
Hate him or love him but the Man is leadign the Driver's championship LOL. Sir Lewis Hamilton. FERNANDO ALONSO I AM SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU PERFORM AT A HIGH LEVEL. YOU ARE MY FAVORITE DRIVER EVER.
When do we kick Bottas off the team
Not a massive fan of Alonso and have always thought he was a bit overrated (he's been beaten by his teammates far too often to be considered a "great" in my opinion) but this race, more than most I've seen from him, REALLY showed his class. Made it far more difficult to pass than I think any other driver would have managed. The way he slowed on the apex of the corner just enough to negate any advantage of Lewis' wider entry line was perfect. And that squeeze to the right of the track when Lewis was trying to go round the outside was LITERALLY the perfect combination of a) scary as **** b) aggressive and c) JUST legal - there must have been a car's width and maybe 1mm there. Perfect driving and I will admit that my opinion of his skills just went up a significant notch. I know lots of you will say "Well you're an idiot for not seeing his talent sooner" and maybe I am but he's been beaten over a season by the likes of Button, Trulli (if I remember correctly) and tied with Hamilton in his rookie season (I know there were team politics but still). On occasions, he has looked like an absolute master in the car but I just haven't seen enough of it over the years. Today, I for SURE saw it. Massively impressed.
Valterri its James, here's your 2022 contract
FIA is a yoke!!!
"Booing  fuels me" ~Hamilton. Nothing feels as bad & lonely as hating on someone & then he keeps on winning... 🤣🤣🤣
This is the most strange I ever watch, like Ocon was verry lucky.
Congrats to Bottas
WHAT A RACE WOW
Alonso the best
Two consecutive races mercedes driver cost verstappen
Great race Lewis! Such an AWESOME one. From 14th to 3rd (2nd), it requires a 'believe in yourself'. You're a legend Lewis! ❤️ Mercedes ❤️
Tout cela ça a été voulu la criminalité organisée par Mercedes tout ça là ça a été voulu ça a été programmée la criminalité organisée du sport anglo-saxon toujours la criminalité en tête monsieur Luis Hamilton doit gagner absolument 8 fois la criminalité organisée a cogné vers stappen comme ça il a mis hors course voulu la criminalité la Gestapo est en route anglo-saxonne la criminalité organisée mondiale conflit d'intérêt par Mercedes ça c'est une criminalité organisée
Wet race Beautifull race
Why are they screaming so much
last race hamilton takes out verstappen now bottas pushes lando into verstappen like cmon get mercedes of the grid
Imagine beating two world champions on the most chaotic race
Sure it's just another coincidence that lewis benefited from max being taken out
Toto: << It's time >> Bottas: *v2 crash intensifies*
Yet another episode in the Dan Ricciardo  "waiting for wood" story.
Bottas' best move all year 👌👌😒
Ma Alonso contro Hamilton?😂
Besteban, Rockon!!
This race means that Bottas will race with Mercedes next year.  CONFIRMED! 😂😂
all start of F1 from now on should be only with Hamilton so a red bull car does not need to be crashed out - it's safer for everyone.
That accident actually ruined Hamilton’s race.
This really lets me want to play F1 2021 and crash into some walls
Valterri "Kamikaze" Bottas
🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 I see Seb Vettel just lost his Second Place finish...  With Vettel GONE from 2nd place, that pushes everyone UP and that means Sir Lewis now gets the SECOND PLACE FINISHER's points. So i guess the FiA will start uncovering unverifiable "FUEL IRREGULARITIES" and other "IRREGULARITIES" on anyone's car who finishes ahead of Sir Lewis. Can you say :  "Let's give Sir Lewis as many championship points as a future Insurance Policy for later on in the Championship season so if  Max is ahead by a couple of points, Sir Lewis will edge him out ??" 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
never in my life would i hear "OCON WINS" congrats to Esteban Ocon
ma course préféré juste incroyable 🔵⚪🔴
Carlo Vanzini pochi minuti prima della gara aveva pronosticato che avrebbe vinto un pilota che non aveva ancora vinto quest'anno.
Bottas is the best  second driver for Mercedes
Latifi and Russell should’ve been co-drivers of the day
With each lap stuck behind Alonso Hamilton lost at least 2.5 seconds in lap time as before Alonso he was lapping Alonso 2-3 seconds faster and after he got past Alonso he was lapping 2-3 faster than everyone and was on the tail of Vettel and Ocon in no time. If Alonso wasn't there Hamilton would've won by 12-15 seconds at least...the least. after all of this Hamilton was literally not able to stand up properly on the podium. wonder what did Alonso did to that poor guy......never seen him so exhausted and so dizzy.  and Alonso is 40 years old and in an Alpine. nothing more to say.
I'm glad I don't have to listen to this commentary when I watch races, that commentator is too much imo
Driver of the day: Valteri Bottas. He turned one of the dullest tracks into the most exciting race of the season.  Shame that he will lose his Mercedes seat. Raikonen and Giovinazzi also should be looking for a new ride.
Poor Leclerc, Norris and Max. They all slaughtered by The Finnish Torpedo.
0:40 Interesting LINE through that corner. Must get extra throttle on exit that way
Best drivers in the world...multi car pile up on the first corner of the race
Is Mercedes deploying a new strategy to take out Max in order to win the Championship?... its very much looks that way...
*HAMMERTIME*
Finally something different.
Toto: we need to come up with new strategy Valteri: say no more✋
Watch the turn 1 carnage at X00.25 speed. Thank me later.😂😂
I can't belive bottas...
How come no one is commenting on how ineffective and off the pace Max was today?
Pause at 0:15 Ok people. Let me clear something up. At the how are we going to handle Redbull this year meeting I said we need push aside how we feel about our competitors and just get back to racing. That's push aside how we feel and not push aside our competitors. Just got a few notes from the PR team. It says. Stop.. Please. Just stop... Another one here says.  HELP! Locked in the basement for weeks. We are NOT in Belize on a team building getaway..
that Alonso  help Ocon alot, LH is just chasing everyone out, 2 more laps he will get Ocon, but Alonso made an incredible defense. what a Team
Is Bottas the drive r of the day?
Petition for upcoming NETFLIX season to be more than 10 episodes. 💯 Because if it's 10 episodes they will leave out a lot of things. 💯
Hamilton,  Vettel and Alonso showed their class today
Could Hamilton be luckier than this? Honestly every race!!!
It’s basically Mercedes just intentionally wrecking Red Bull at this point. For years f1 fans have made fun of nascar for this type of driving, but look at the sad state of f1 today.
Vettel: Gets P2 *Has 700g less fuel* FIA: DISQUALIFICATION
Nico Rosberg the voice of F1. Must become a full time commentator. So insightful!
bottas did more for hamilton as merc for bottas
what bottas did to red bull car is pur genius 1 for 2
Mission accomplished for bottas. Taking out two Red Bulls at once.
Mercedes: and the 1st time was so nice I had to do it twice
Alonso did a lot to help his team mate win that , keeping LH behind for so long was awesome driving.
The highlights were around 2 hours today.
Happy tha ocon won. Sad that vettel got disqualified
James: Valteri it’s James, do the team a favor and take out the Red Bulls for us okay? Bottas: …….. James: but one thing, please make it look like an accident.
"Hit somebody!" It's what they all roared, when Buddy the goon came over the boards....
Well done alonso
Hamilton has been given second place now Vettel has been disqualified for not providing 1.0 litre sample of fuel.
Horner:  LEWIS MADE A PROFESSIONAL PENALTY!
Muy sospechoso lo de Bottas
Bottas took out both RB cars , Mercedes making sure they had the lead going into the summer break. Fernando was terrific , Ocon and Vetel should buy him a pint really.
I guess Hamilton radio of "at that speed its so dangerous man" is not interesting/controversial enough for the media...
Wow, what could do Alonso with a Mercedes?
Quite a wholesome moment of Alonso basically giving Ocon the win by defending off Hamilton
bottas, you should race for yourself.. dont kamikaze for the other
"Valteri, it's James" "Mitä?" "S🅱️inalla"
"ALONSO WINS THE HUNGARIAN GP"
lol they just ruin millions of dollars in parts because they cant drive after so much training. how sad
FIA: we have to let LH win or he's gona cry Racism on us..
So proud for Alonso and Ocon!!! By a Alonso fan
How does taking out 3 Rivals only give you 5 place grid penalty. Race ban seems pretty fair to me.
Valteri it's Bono, it's bowling time!!!
Best F1 race I've seen for some time.
well done bottas knocking out both red bull cars Lewis 8th i am being sarcastic
Esteban don’t met pas à fastest car ! The aston is better
Red Bull going to the FIA with a recording proving if you play the Mercedes team radio backwards you can hear the devil.
Why didn't Mercedes pit Hamilton like everyone else, does anyone know why?
Great to see Alonso defending against Hamilton for Ocon!
I want extended highlights for this race!
Una schifazza peggiore di questa mai vista state rovinando anche questo sport con la vostra incompetenza 👏👏👏
Stroll trying those video game moves
NO descalificas a uno que choco a un auto a 300 KM/H... NO descalificas a un auto que provoco que 4 pilotos abandonaran la carrera. Pero SI descalificas a un auto que no traía una lata de refresco de combustible.
4:48 they're not competing for the championship. Why should Hamilton crash into Alonso?
Fun fact, Alpine has just opened it's first dealership in Hungary. This is the best marketing move ever!
Vettel disqualified for not having 1L of fuel left in the tank?! Can someone please explain why they need a full liter?
Hamilton:- I deliberately took out one redbull in the last race. Bottas:- hold my beer!!!
Bottas just invented a new sport: car bowling.
Lewis vs Everyone.
Beau travail de Alpine
Underrated thing about this race was Nico's commentary
Mercedes. Sporty behavior. One sentence.  Hahahahahahaha.
Vettel is disqualified so he won't get p2
take a long summer break, I don't care anymore
Vettel dq was some real bs
This is a sport that has lost most of its audience because of this type of race. The best drivers cannot win because they are held up on track where overtaking is hard by lessor drivers. The winner is some no hopper who is not even in the championship race. I used to go to GP races but it is all too boring now.
I feel terrible for Vettel.
After this race if you are not agree with the reverse grid you don’t understand anything about entertainment. I would like to see the tv ratings
F**k Bottas
"See George? That's what we need you to do next year!"
Инсценированый старт(
IF THEY DIDNT DO THOSE ACCIDENTS PURPOSELY
Hamilton's luck is 2nd to none. Period!
ESTEBAN OCON LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Hey bottas you were supposed to knock verstappen out of the race, not half the grid
Where are the Alonso defensive driving clips in this highlight?
THIS. IS. HUNGARY. 🇭🇺 Never underestimate the Ring ever again, home to one of the best races of the past few years💪
Can we appreciate Rosberg’s commentary? Was thoroughly enjoying it. It was funny how excited he would get at some of the moves, especially Alonso’s defense and Lewis’ overtake of Ricciardo and Verstappen.
Bottas' pov: STIKE
RUSSELL FINALLY GOT HIS POINTS FINISH YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Horner: checo you have new challenge for ourteam. Do same action like Bottas after summer break.
Just insane
Mercedes new offer Bang 1 and Get 2 RedBulls.Offer Limited till Year end.😎🤪
Ocon/Alpine.😍😍😍 Trop fier ! 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Such an incredible race, such great driving today, Ocon & Alanzo were superb.
Watching alonso and vettel is still so much joy  Give them better cars please 🥺

THANK U BOTTAS for giving us the most interesting race of the season.... WE LOVE U.... KEEP DOING THAT...
Erm since when have Red Bulls been Orange? Just asking for a friend. Cue conspiracy nuts claiming Bottas was ordered to do it.
sorry for this, but, that was the worst race in this season
Hamilton alone at the restart: I heard Valtteri made a big mess but I wasn't expecting it to be this big!
Bottas really out here risking it all.... lol
🅱️ottas executed mercedes master 🅱️lan
What if Hamilton's car broke before pitlane? 🤔
Wow congratulations to Ocon. You are a race winner !
Mercedes just wants the second drivers to do what they tell them to do. That's why they have just confirmed a contract extension with Bottas.
Oh the editor finally figured out the audio compression problems (Crofty's voice sounds much clearer here if you noticed)
Wie assi das man Vettel noch zu Siegerehrung holt und ich dann disqualifiziert,  also da wäre ich auch mad
2:26 - Guenther Steiner "... Bunch of F**** Clowns here ... " 😅
Bottas dive bombing cars.....new strategy? What a shake up!
Lewis has officially become the final boss of F1
Why verstappend didn't change his car
Mercedes Strategy Meeting Post Baku:   "Ya, und zo, ve haff ze failure vit Brake Magic.  Zo, in future ve vill deploy Kamikaze Mode instead.  Louvis vill use dis at Silvaschtun, und Valterri vill use in Hungary".
deporte corrupto ya es una burla para el publico. no veo una carrera de f1 nunca mas, esto es un asco. chau f1. que te sigan los tontos q siguen creyendo en papa noel y los reyes magos... por q esto esta todo escrito para q halmilton ( falso campeon ) gane el campeonato
They need to change the rules. Bottle should receive 6 penalties.  He cause 6 collisions not just one.  20 place grid penalty next race and a 10 place grid penalty the race after.  The fact that sergio is going to end up not getting points this race and also taking a 10 place grid penalty next race is ridiculous.  Let alone the fact that max had to race a half a car all race and got minimum points.
Wow what a race! ❤️
Just imagine if Mercedes paid Bottas to take out the field, but Red Bull took it further and poisoned Hamilton. Would have explained Hamilton’s dizziness🤷‍♀️
I'm so happy for Ocon. Such a nice guy
Alonso showing his still got it and I feel for Vettel.
Everybody diving in the switch tires while Lewis stayed out alone basically negated any advantage from the lap1 wreck!
Alonso is incredible ...what a defense !!
Finally, alpine where they belong to
2:00 what a genius move tho
What a race
Who's here after vettel got dsq 😪
Videoen er ikke tilgængelig Denne video er ikke tilgængelig  Cant see the video!
Well Bottas has definitely kept his seat for next year.  Really wanted Seb to be first.
HAMILTON WORLD CHAMPION 2021
Mercedes: Valtteri, you take one for the team...execute order 69
That little turbo release at 3:55 makes me wish we had better car audio during broadcasts
That’s it guys! You can say goodbye to the exciting season we were having!
can they please get rid of that highly irritating Screamer that is supposed to be a Commentator !
3dr Sainz Vettel disqualified
F1 Fans: Ew it's Hungaroring. It's boring. Bottas: Are you sure about that? Love Hungaroring.
Hamilton being the only one on the grid to restart the race is one of the most hilarious things I've ever seen happen in F1....
Mercedes is happy, they already have the child Lewis of 1   ..!!!!!!
Valtteri, it's James...
Bottas unlocked a new achivement: taking out two redbull in one corner! Only one did it before, Maldonado with 2 Force india... Lando was just colateral damage. Maybe they should ban Mercedes for one race for taking out theire rival twice on following week end... that's not serious obviously but disqualifing Vettel for inssuficient fuel is a shame and show how inconsitent FIA is, why not have disqualified Hamilton last year at Silverstone for inssuficient tire? He should have pit even if it's the last lap Oh and don't forget what Hamilton said about Alonso driving "It's dangerous at those speed!" guess he is not alone... well worst in fact!  PS I'm not a Max fan boy not a somebody boy either  Ocon drive was spectacular! Guess his boss make the wrong statement few days ago "He is not championship material" well he still win a race with Vettel following it's not nothing and his contract is extended for few more years so what wrong with that boss? Toto be like: "Did we realy let go Ocon?"
Mercedes: Pleaze Valtteri help Lewis, we need you.  Bottas: Yoloooooo
I still cannot fully believe this race happened. What a weird race.
Hamilton: at that speed it's too dangerous man...
In this sport you can throw your opponent out at 300 km/h or strike everyone like an amateur, but if your team makes a slight mistake  (which you have no control over) your race is destroyed. Really embarrassing sport
bottas secures his seat at mercedes next season
6:36 The most Father and son moment I ever saw in F1
Very happy for vettel. Congratulations to ocon for pole and alonso for a great run🔥
Am I last wow that was rough
Of course the one race I miss is the race of the season... Was funny to check the classification on lap 20...
The most crazy s*** I've ever seen
Sainz 3th Alonso 4th Lewis 5th  Lewis: HOLD MY VEGAN BURGER
And Max being aggressive again with Schumacher smh
I hope the Mercedes goes to the amusement park.
Didnt giovanazi went for the gamble and put on medium tires before the start of the race.. so at the restart he should already have those mediums on his car... So why did he went in again after the formation lap of the restart... He should hv been with lewis and he should should have been leading the race..  Now this all depends on which tires did he put on at the start of the race? Can anyone confirm?
Alonso to Ocon: I've held long enough for you son, im proud of you.
And again mercedes mess up the race!! They should be banned  for a least a season
When is the Mercedes announcement that Botas extends his contract after executing “Order 44”?!
Mazepin: *pitting* Raikkonen: *im gonna end this whole mans career*
Robbery (again) to sebastian vettel
Bottas absolutely change the race.......burggg
Redbull should bring a tractor with them in Next race, and position it behind Max.
Ham had last dnf 3 years ago. I mean really
What a joke.
1:19 Indianapolis 2005 flashbacks
*Latest News Vettel Disqualified so Lewis awarded 2nd.*
Leclerc has been the unluckiest on the grid for the past 3 years
The real goat said to the fake goat YOU SHALL NOT PASS!! till the tires gave out, your welcome   Esteban Alonso haters you are a yoke !
Full replay on Ham and Alo battle please
Nico needs to return mercedes, he was way better compared to Bottas.
Petition for an Extended Highlights version like Germany
Only way to stop Max? Crash into him.
But we cant ignore the fact that Hamilton really pulled 14 -> 3, big respect to him he looks exhausted tho
Mercedes: Bottas, wona keep ur seat. Then take out as many red bulls as you can. We need to cheat to win again.
This will be in the next top 10 hungarian gp moments
Show bela corrida.
They go full public lobby mode
Vettel: Yeey! What do I win? FIA: A sad feeling... Vettel: Ooooh :(
Last News!! After Bottas' brilliant career in Hungary, he arranged a new contract with Mercedes to stay with the team.
Spaniards showing Max how to actually race "Hard but fair"
Who's here after Vettel got Dsq'd?
Williams-gets double points finish Commentators-“ima pretend I didn’t see that”
That I was NOT expecting...!
Williams 🔥
Vettel robbed.
Amazing race from the best driver in the world @lewishamilton , a true legend no doubt. Certainly wayyyyyy better than Schumacher *LEGEND*  (Incoming “I’m not racist”Lewis Hamilton haters in 3….2..1) LH44
Mazepin of the RACE: WET TOTO
Use me as a "Pray for Seb" Button. Aston filed an appeal and are confident.
"OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX" that gave me goosebumps..
Bottas really is the ultimate team player
Hungary 2021 : trey bonn trey bienne formidable
After the expert analyses of the british reporters, the marshals and the people of this channel they concluded it was verstappen's fault that mercedes crashed the entire front grid. On top of that it is most likely going to be redbull's fault for Hamilton not feeling well after the race, but they are still looking into that.
Sainz 3rd! 🥳🥳🥳 like it should be! 😝🤭🤫
Mercedes putting "There's no I in team"   Very nice torpedo for Bottas  "Valtteri, it's James. well done"   Max shouldn't have turned in. he could have avoided that 😂😂😂    real classy from Mercedes
Mercedes needs to be careful to not turn this into CrashGate 2.0
Does Lewis go to 2nd now that the DQ happened?
For how many laps did Alonso hold off Lewis?
you miss a lot with only watching the highlights. the hamilton/alonso fight was huge
Toto: 'Redbulls aren't orange bottas....'
Bowling anyone.
It's so cool to see Hamilton alone, and then a lot of cars to chase him.
So Mercedes took the lead in construcrors: maFIA: finally we made it
What a shitshow. The whole season, really.
Amazing race by both alpine drivers, especially alonsos battle with Hamilton shows how much skill he still has. Also amazing for Williams. And the Vettel DQ is again just laughable...both middle fingers to those Stewarts
Bottas  provocó el choque de forma intencional, ya lo había rebasado checo.
I’ve never seen a race start with just 1 car but it looks so funny😂
Rest of the Grid: *start racing* Bottas: Almighty PUSH!
When the hands speak
F*cin Lewis.
I guess Bottas really is a team player.
Of course No one is going to talk about how lando could've gone wider before braking but chose to close off Bottas and got close to taking out both Mercedes cars but ended up collecting both red bulls. All for a failed attempt at a Senna move. But sure go after Mercedes again Honda needs all the help they can get.
Guessing that Bottas thinks he will retain his Mercedes seat after taking out two Red Bulls at the start.  A true team driver...
Bad mistake from Mercedes... If they'd pitted and changed tyres they would've won that easily.
Mclaren and ferrari tied for 3rd in constructors! Bring on second half of the season!
I keep seeing people saying that just because someone can keep hamilton behind for a few laps, is a ''better'' driver than him, for god's sake, the guy came from the last one position, risking everything, on each one overtake he took a seriously chance to have a crash, because on this track is very dangerous, and Hamilton made it perfectly, so before saying anything, think twice, Alonso is a incredible champion, but Hamilton has made the overtaken because Alonso did a mistake, and Hamilton don't! Obs: If there were 2 or 3 laps more, Hamilton would have won!
Mercedes tactics: take out Verstappen with Bottas. 😄
The start of every F1 2021 race! 🤣
Hamilton alone on the starting grid: "Nice work Valtteri"
I’m pretty sure merc are planning these crashes🤔🤔
Grosjean of the day: Stroll
Hamilton: Valteri… we don’t want what happened last race to happen again, right? Bottas: What you got in mind… Hamilton: Just make it look like an accident Bottas: that’s sick, sir Hamilton: gots to see it through, my boy.
I can’t believe this has 1.2m views in 4hours it is the most boring “sport” I’ve ever seen, i would literally rather watch netball or handball... or watch paint dry. how do so many people love this...
Mercedes was so impressed by Bottas new found talent so in coming races he will be driving a turbo charged bulldozer.
The genius Lewis Hamilton Força Petronas increíble Lewis Hamilton
GEORGE IS IN THE MF POINTS
Yep fia always do things to help hamilton
Yep fia always do things to help hamilton
Bien Alonso carajo
that's some of the best teamwork I've seen in F1 props to Alonso for holding Hamilton for so long
And there goes Max’s title
Can we have a fair fight for the title from now on please.
I hope Lewis gets well in the upcoming days, he looked really exhausted.
Toto - we're one DNF from getting back to P1 Lewis - On my Way (Silverstone),  Toto - this hasn't worked out that well, we're still P2, let's make it two, Bottas, you're a team player, aren't you?  Bottas - sure dude, no problem, consider it done.
Alonso to Hamilton: The past always comes back.
Graet race, Lewis?....stay off the radio. Your Grosgean was your teammate today.
Mercedes master🅱lan
ELLE EST POUR TOI ESTEBAN ! OUI MON GARÇON ! TU L'AS FAIT !!!
Verstappen is such an aggressive driver, he almost caused another crash
Bottas taking 1 for the team
FIA disqualified Seb cause of fuel. Honestly these guys are a joke. Even Nascar is smarter than these clowns.
Did Bottas receive  a bonus for taking out both Redbulls?
Well done Ocon ! 🍾🥂🎉🥳
Mercedes causing another trouble
Mercedes new plan... we cant beat them lets crash them!
Slow Merc starts? Get the misc. drivers to take out both close competitors.
Toto: "verstappen just needs one dnf and the championship will be close again." Bottas: "what about two dnf's?" Hits wrong red bull
Bottas' collision looked deliberate
What a bowling by bottas… taking out lando, max and Sergio SMH…
Lewis: “At that speed it’s so dangerous” Me: “Silverstone”
2021 is turning out to be a spectacular F1 season!
F(k Lws
FIA '' Russell in top 3? GIVE THOSE PLACES BACK NOW!''
Imagine being Ocon right now, it's your first ever victory in F1, you're sharing the podium with Hamilton and Vettel, and you could not have won this race without Alonso. It's like the F1 gods blessed him with this win...
Based Alonso for blocking Hamilton to let Ocon get his first F1 Victory.
lets make rest of the season like 1:19 , let hamilton win everything and be done with all this sh1tshow...
Go Fernando, one of his best race in my opinion.
Bottas taking out both Redbulls and Norris.. Go figure....
Bravo Alpine, Bravo Ocon, Bravo Master Alonso
Mercedes : We have found an easy way to win WC! Bottas: How? Mercedes : Took as many rivals out as possible. Bottas: Copy that
Also Williams takes P8 and P9 for five points the first time in this season
Mercedes and Redbull: No payback, we race *Rosberg boom* Bottas *activating the Mercedes master Plan* Horner: Aight.... revenge is now <*Summer Break*> Horner: NooOOOOoOOOOOo
George got his first points in the Williams!!
FIA disqualified Vettel, lucky Hamilton
Valteri, this is James. To confirm your seat next year, crash as many cars as you can, including RB.  Valteri: ok, done.
What a race!!!!
I love Nico Rosberg as a commentator. Hope he stays for the rest of the season
Alonso still got some ball wow
5:45 Hamilton uses DRS, that should be a penalty right? Its a question
Toto, 2018: “It is the second time we got taken out, a lot of constructor points. In James Allison’s words: ‘Do you think it is deliberate or incompetence?’”
1 lock up on the opening turn and disaster....
not all heroes wear capes some drives the second Mercedes car lol
If Hamilton wins this years Championship, he should be ashamed for it. I cant remember a season where a title contender got so lucky while underperforming and cracking under the pressure as he is this year.
Hamilton gets second - Vettel DQ'd for fuel rules
Imagine turning your TV right at 1:39 😂
Just Announced Bottas contract extension for 2022 after a brilliant team drive
No one realised that Mercedes' new upgrade is a battering ram 🍢🐏😆😎
lucky lewis, yaaawwwnn
Thank you Alonso for making this race exciting
Seb got DSQ'd !!!!! NOOOOOO
yep.. Mercedes should be banned on the next race.. they cause collisions and call it "racing incident".. call it what you want but clearly it was done deliberately..
Bravo Ocon 😍😍
I thought highlights will last 2 hours….
Ocon owes that all to Alonso
Vettel has lost his second place
Here after Vettel lost his 2nd place....disgusting
Verstappen always dangerous 2:43
This race was all about that Hamilton and Alonso battle! Bwoah!
Can't wait to watch the Netflix episode
I would've luv'd to have seen Lewis have 4 more laps to pass Vettal and Ocon. Unfortunately the FIA  allows slower cars to impede faster cars.    The FIA also wanted Max to continue his unblemished penalty card. I guess if you can pass them clean you try to wreck them. Max fan's not a word thought.
alonso  ocon master class team this race
What a race
FFS vettel has been DSQ! Only 300ml of fuel left in his car. Feel so sorry for him but great drive regardless. Means hamilton 2nd and sainz 3rd.
Vettel is disqualified cause of the fuel sample, bottas crashes 3 cars and get 5 place grid penalty. Hamilton nearly injures verstappen and destroys redbull cost million dollar and gets 20 seconds. It's a joke. ( I am not fan of any of theese drivers I just feel its not fair )
Alonso is a King.
I was not able to see the race today so I' ve watched this video. Still no idea of what i' ve just saw and how they got to these positions
The greatest race of the season, absolute madness
Driver of the day Nico Roseberg, we need more of him in the commentary box
Ocontol
Sebastian Vettel disqualified after insufficient fuel sample after race, loses P2. Stewards finalises the result, with Lewis Hamilton lifted to second and Carlos Sainz to third.
Vettel sos el mejor
Merc really gonna crash there way to a championship dub huh
Sad 😔 Max isn't winning the Championship this year.
Nice to see Hungry making a stand against the rainbow fascists! Ban anyone who promotes that woke identitarian BS!👏🏿👏🏿🔥🌈🌈🌈🔥
Que buena carrera
Alonso's defense was amazing. He's still got it. Hope he gets a competitive car next year.
It's also worth noting that Williams finally got their first few points in about two years. About time!
alonso is proving why he still deserves to be in F1
Imagine if Hamilton had also pitted and had the slick tyres.. He would've finished 1 minute ahead of 2nd car with that pace..  Like he was only 2-3 seconds behind Ocon.  Not a win for Hamilton but man that was a great race.. and on a track where Overtaking is very difficult..  And I am very Happy for Esteban.. I always root for him every season, he is such an underrated driver on the grid and gets hate for past incident with Verstappen. What great race drove by him.. Amazing
So sad to see Hamilton securing the championship in a total BS way in the first 15 seconds.
BIEN JOUÉ OCON 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
Mercedes los mas tramposos botas iso su trabajo
I guess we now all know what the Mercedes team tactics are? What a sad team they have become….
So Mercedes completely stuffed Redbull's chances 2 GPs in a row.
Imagine Bottas not listening to the Team at the start of the race…it would have turned out different 😂
Bottas graduated from wing man to hatchet man, only to have Mercedes not think through on the tire issue. The Hungarians, for their part, held the start until the peak of the storm. Overall, one bizarre day.
Steiner: "of course!"
Who is here after Vettel's dsq😭😭
This f1 is every day worse and worse
1:22 Season 2022 Racestart Spoiler when FIA has to DSQ all others because Hamilton hasn't the best car anymore
Hamilton been promoted to 2nd place
Unbelievable race!
Can’t believe Ocon celebrated when Lewis has been sent to hospital. Disrespectful
This is why the last race decision was such a bad one. You never know what going to happen next week, let it playout.
Well that was amazing, I'm delighted for Ocon and Vettel and for both Williams in the point ❤️❤️
Lights out and away he goes :P
Ocon & Alpine 👏🏻👍🏻
Who else hates the monkey and whole Mercedes Team? 🦧
Mafia
lewis was gonna win this race and it would have been insane and a bigger blow to red bull fans. That Mercedes is super fast the progress made by their engineers was big. This could give red bull a bit of a problem for the rest of the season
Who's here after Vettel dsq? 😭😭😭
Bottas should come to nascar. He would be a fan favorite.      Of course joking Bottas is a great driver but slipped up today and F1 and NASCAR have different aspects that make them both great motorsports. Bye bye see y’all
It was a joke, Bottas bumps 4 of the favourites leaving them out of the race without any consequence, and disqualifies Vettel, better give the championship to Mercedes now 🤡
I avoided all other social media until I was able to see this video. Glad I did 🔥🔥🥴
Yes a real race that's what we want
In the end this wasn't luck,  Ocon qualified ahead of his teamate and in middle of points..  And held back Vettel for 60 laps.. He put  himself in the perfect spot to get lucky lol
Bottas fighting to keep that seat
A lot of mentally illnf1 fans in the comments of social media today it’s getting extremely toxic, I hope these people don’t breed
Ocon well done for winning a crazy race are you defending Sebastian Vettel auto respect Axel everyone in the world first one well done
Mercedes planned the accident.
What a shait show!  So last week Lewis mistake sended a redbull flying, this week Bottas mistake sends two redbulls flying, wen ever coincidence matches with interest something tells me it's not.....................
Hamilton and Bottas have to be banned from atleast 5 races!
Crashes are part of the game but i cant help but to feel sorry for those engineers everytime it happens. People dont realize how much work it is to repair an F1 car from scratch sometimes it takes a couple of races to get the car perfect again with all the fine tuning.
Mercedes bottas and Hamilton are idiots
Williams now have 10 points after a DSQ for Vettel. Alfa Romeo 1 point.
latifi > bottas an russel for merc seat
Is Mercedes going to do a double take out next race?
Bottas converting that 6-7-10 split!
i feel sorry for seb.... 😥
We live in a world were alpine win a race before ferrari and mclaren on that note imma head out.
Bottas: Driver of the Day😅
Mercedes ruining a race again
Respect to Tsunoda for backing out at turn 4.
Seb's been disqualified -- not enough fuel left in the tank after the race.
somebody please stop hamilton please..i really hate this guy..
Another dramatic 1round of the race.. Another professional display from Sir Lewis Hamilton.
Bottas : come back stronger next weekend  Next weekend :
bottas ‼️
Bottas really needs that seat, doesn't he?
hit the break and master the situation, or...well sometimes you just have to go for it, I guess
at 01:19 Lewis: Why am I alone? Toto: You are racing Safety Car.
Just keeps getting more and more interesting
Oh how i missed hearing Crofty's voice today because F1 TV decided they are gonna use their own pit lane channel idiots instead no thank you
Toto Wolfe is not more shity, just because he is not taller,,, Bottas it's just his puppet
maFIA
Wish the slowest Williams for Bottas in 2022
Now that innocent Vettel has been disqualified and that has effectively promoted Hamilton to second it is inevitable that the moaners and the haters of Hamilton will come here to complain that he went to see the FIA to get that done
Breaking: Bottas lose contract with Mercedes for failing to take out both Red bulls.
Sebastián vettel just got disqualified, 1.ocon 2. Hamilton 3. Sainz
Merc finally found the crashtrategy!  💥
Another better than (≥) equality of outcome race. Why are the silver arrows black again, can someone explain? Sarcasm intended.
You just gotta love the Hungaro ring.
Wolff: Bottas about your contract next year... Bottas: SAY NO MORE
"Valtteri, this is James....Execute Order 66."  "Yes, my lord."
Bottas takes out both red bulls on lap 1 turn 1???... i cant be the only one with my eyebrow raised lol. I think he just secured his mercedes seat for next year
Two trailer park boys go 'round the outside.. 'round the outside.
Hamilton is GOAT coming from the last to 3rd
QUE ANTIPROFESIONAL ACTUACIÓN DE ESTOS CAFRES DEL VOLANTE.....!!!
The sports a joke. Getting worse by the  year why I don’t watch it no more
I would have become a HUGE Alanso fan if he would have just wrecked Hamilton!!!
The amount of money that goes away with every crash is crazy😩 Millions!
Driver of the day in my opinion...Sir Lewis Hamilton.
Alonso, why was you holding up Lewis just let him pass because he’s going to pass you anyway. What a d......
Where is Martin brundle???? Rosberg is not suitable for the job. Not enough knowledge and sweet calming voice. Croft and Martin together bring so   much excitement to the race weekend.
Nobody talking about how Williams scores points...
Poor seb :(
Guess Sky paid them to made it more attractive to sub to them,nah man ty.
Literally a Mercedes fan page, Alonso straight up destroyed Hamilton for ten laps and all we got was two shots in the highlights. Vettel got robbed in the end too, so sad
An absolute horror for redbull because Mercedes crashed them out again, I hope they both have stuck throttle and no break at the next race
1:24 Lights out and it looks as if Lewis has lead!
vettel robbed
Lando was way too over confident for the wets and bottas was way too careless for wets
Mercedes strategy is now clear!!!
It takes a world champion to stop a world champion
The latest news on F1 official website :  ""Vettel loses second-place finish in Hungary after disqualification for fuel sample issue"  So Sainz get P3 and Hamilton get P2 in Hungarian Grand Prix.  Well done Aston Martin.....
mercedes is driving as devil people that not can agains losing totally hamilton and toto time to ban them from race with this plan of driving f1 cars 2 races after together to put drivirs out from redbull and fia helping hamilton with p2 because the dnf that fia give agains vettel because to low full left
Lewis maior de todos
Alonso è un leone...emozione pura...Grazie
“Alonso doesn’t need any help” - Daniel ricciardo
"alright bottas heres a real opportunity on the inters....i need you to crash out both red bulls and even noris if we can manage it" bottas- "copy"
Typical Mercedes can’t handle the pressure so they wreck other cars.
Why you gotta do Seb like that?  Would've been a 5 star race if it wasn't for this...
Hamilton is not blessed, he has a team mate as a rambbot. Please Hamilton Crash for us you deserve It
Vettel has been disqualified😪😪😪 I'm disgusted
I came here for the excuses and tears of the Max fans. It's kinda sweet, one week after another.
Toto : Bottas do you want another season Bottas : yes..
Im not a fan of any team but isnt it a bit obvious?
Interesting tactics at work by mercedes...
Vettel got a penalty and loss the 2nd position after checking of fuel🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Спасибо деду за победу
blocking someone in qualifying = 3 place grid penalty Destroying 3 cars in the first turn = 5 place grid penalty Spa 2012 = race ban Sending someone in the wall = 10 seconds penalty Not enough fuel = disqualification  Something is wrong here...
Seb disqualified for fuel sample issue.  A Flawless drive to a disappointing end <3
Verstappen the dirtball
The amount of luck Ham has will turn against him soon.
What an amazing race
1:16 hahahaha what a bizarre situation
Verstappen is a very skillful driver Now he needs to become a more lucky driver 🍀
0:20 F1 games online in a nutshell
That Alpine Rookie has a bright future ahead of him.
If anyone says Vettel doesnt have it anymore, i dont know what will prove em wrong
maFIA
Bottas 😡😡 🖕🖕🖕🖕
Well done maFIA, you robbed to Vettel now you just need to know how to rob Ocon to put your beloved Hamilton in P1!!!
Being on the outside in the wet is a coin toss
Wow what a win for ocon
I was a bit worried about Hamilton getting jumped on the restart
F Mercedes
To think that Daniel could have had an amazing race if Stroll found his brake pedal...... 😔
since when is rosberg commentating?
Lewis Hamilton's only friend is Lewis Hamilton. Hopefully Max actually gets that at this point. If this isn't a clear enough picture of Mercedes and Lewis for people. Whatever.
-hitting max car from behind making him crash supporting 50G and destroying his car and his race : 10 SECONDS PENALTY. - destroying the race of both redbulls and one mclanren, millions in car repairs : 5 POSITIONS PENALTY NEXT RACE. - not be able to give FIA 1l of fuel :DESCALIFICATION. F1 rules are the most stuppids one I have ever heard in any sport. Rules support more crashing agaisnt your enemy that race against others.
Lewis; Alonso was “dangerous” at the top of the hill  Also Lewis; What I did in Copse was fine
Who got driver of the day .. Max??
Toto: you can win this race  Alonso: lol no
Bottas is best 2nd driver for the team in history of F1.
Very well played by bottas
"Bottas this is Totto. Execute order 666." 😅
Is Hammertime? No! It´s MAGIC time
BOATass pit maneuver
Vettel disqualified for not having enough fuel 😥
WELL THAT WAS A NEW WAY TO CHEAT TO GET MORE POINTS FOR LEWIS HAMILTON, JUST HAVE YOUR TEAMMATE WREAK MAX AT THE BEGINNING AGAIN. WHY DONT YOU JUST GIVE HIM THE CHAMPIONSHIP AND SEND EVERYONE HOME. PATHETIC
For anyone unaware Vettle has been disqualified due to fuel.
Alonso and Ocon saved this Grand Prix from Hamilton cry-baby, but Bottas is the one to make it happen.
everyone ignore that Hamilton was on 14th. So yeah, 3rd for him is an amazing work.
this year's drive to survive is going to be crazy!
What a race! What a season!
hamilton attended a driving lesson today by Alonso. 😂😂
Bottas and Mazepin the kings of destruction !
Seb was disqualified for not having enough fuel in his car, but managed to finish the race in P2, like come on FIA might aswell give lewis the championship now
A lot of ill-informed comments on here with conspiracy theories about Vettel's DQ.  I was hoping he would win, but it's not Vettel's fault regarding the fuel in his car, and has nowt to do with Hamilton.
For those new to F1 let me explain  the penalty system: 1. Cross the white line on pit entry: 10 second time penalty 2. Wipe your opponent out of the race at dangerously high speeds: also 10 seconds 3. Use slightly to much fuel: instant disqualification
Aaaaalonsoooooo 😍
Go Ham. Go Lewis!
Alonso is a legend
Trop cool ! Ça bouge enfin. Il était temps.
0:34 turns steering wheel into red bull lol
Vettel got disqualified.  Huh.
MAGIC ALONSO, EL SAMURAI
Fia is ruining this sport, change my mind.
It is really unfair how much Luck Lewis has..he would be 60 to 80 points behind Max withouth all that luck. Bahrain, Imola, Baku, Silverstone and now this..Pure on track racing Lewis is no match at all for Max so far this year..plain luck keeping him in the race
Just found out that vettel got disqualified, I feel so bad for him.
Well Botas gets to keep his seat after taking out both Red Bulls.
14TH TO 3RD, SAYS IT ALL, GAVE WAY IN THIS RACE,KNOW WHEN 2 BACK DOWN GUYS!!! GREAT ENTERTAINMENT!!!
The most embarrassing race from Toto ever,  being the only team not to pit, how did that happen..?
Idk why but that winning run both alpine side to side just give a big smile to my face.
maFIA
It's crash - mercedes plan It's rain - mercedes plan It's already dry - mercedes plan It's not pitting - mercedes plan It's last - mercedes plan It's penalty - mercedes plan It's dnf Ferrari - mercedes plan It's difficult to past Alonso - mercedes plan It's Ocon win - mercedes plan It's on podium - mercedes plan It's at 10 places - mercedes plan It's just a new kid who's starting love F1 last month - max fans It's a clown - max fans 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is Rosberg the second comentary?
Just received the news that Vettel was disqualified.   This makes me sad 🤦
Meanwhile Lewis is back on top of the standings. Full steam ahead!
I hate the FIA
Way to race, Esteban!!! Enjoy this moment!!! 🌟🌟🌟
Mercedes and the FIA are just some bad jokes...
Amazing recovery drive by Hamilton.
Planned crash by Mercedes‘
hamilton always manages to get along at the expense of other people's misfortune.
Someone pinch me. Did... Russell... Did he... Just score points in a Williams?...
The french is tres bon tres brilliant, informidable?  Hardly recognized that.
Interesting
I feel so bad for Seb, because of his DSQ. Now Ham gets into 2nd without any effort again.
It's just an accident baby. It's always just an accident that benefit me.
I swear Lewis has the most luck out of all drivers. Everything always fall into his place. Now even Vettel gets DQed. I can't believe it.
The very beginning looks like a different race entirely. Different weather, 6 extra cars, and a front of the field car being in front, not 2 midfielders getting podiums
Toto wolf during the red flag: Congrats George here is a seat for next year
Perez: “We’ll get them tomorrow” Mercedes: “And we took that personal”
Agent Bottas completed his mission given by Toto Wolff
Amazing F1 season. Just enjoy it and let out the loosers frustration fan mode speech. Great to see Alpine at great level and Ocon wining. Alonso was amazing protecting that
This is so embarrassing for Bottas. Literally takes out everyone who passed him at the start, not just the Redbull. Incredible......
Hey Formula 1, how about you include in your thumbnail the car that actually took out all top drivers in first corner except Lewis???
Merc to Bottas: "You're the last one. Complete the mission."
VETTEL WAS SCAMMED
Its all set up for Hamilton to win the title again and for Merc to win the constructors titles.
Riccardo: I spin in solidarity
Mercedes, one stone hits two birds
Aston Martin drawing ever closer to Instant Classics. .. PS: That new kid Vettel is something!! lol
While Alonso’s defending was incredible, his tyre life played a huge factor. He pitted late & had the next youngest tyres beside Hamilton.
daniel ricciardo's reason is getting bad to worst.
"Lewis is going too feel like he's right at the back because that's where he's is".🤔🤣🤣
2nd race in a row Max was taken out by a Mercedes. Not saying it was intentional by any means. I was so upset when the crash happened. Right at the beginning of the race. I couldn’t believe it.
Shame on you maFIA for doing this to Seb. You think you’ll get away? Karma always strikes back to those who make ill.
Vettel disqualified?! Thats a YOKE!
Mercedes pilots are on NUKE MODE! ...this is not nice, this is not DERBY !
3:08 Pure magic!
Alonso still holding on to feelings from the McClaren days
Bottas crashing into both red bull cars at the first turn of the race... Yep nothing to see here!! "All conspiracy" Mazepin is a bad driver, YET NOT EVEN HIM WOULD PULL SOME BS LIKE THIS....like come on...
Verstappen, once again, bangs a car and drives away free of any penalty... What a disgrace!!!
2 crashes, both from mercedes and they ruined Max's races, Not at all enjoying this season anymore
Alonso proved today that age really doesn't matter
After seeing Russell at his first Mercedes race last year (he humiliated his teammate) and all the pleasures made to Hamilton in recent years (he acts like his butler) today's crash makes Bottas embarrassing even for the Mercedes.
Guys why the results are turned upside down?! It must be reversed 10 to 1 😄
Vettel got disqualified after the race ???
Vettel disqualified😭
Just came after seb got shafted by maFIA
Where the Maxipad fans at 😂🤣😂 they don’t seem to be talking much.
Williams 2013 driver line-up: Pastor Maldonado and a rookie Valtteri Bottas Now we know who taught him those skills....
Bottas' perfect wingman play! With one crash he...  1. took out Hamilton's championship rival (Verstappen) 2. took out his own championship rivals (Norris and Perez) 3. helped a former Mercedes junior (Ocon) to get his first race win 4. helped the current Mercedes junior (Russell) to score his first points of the season
Bottas is amazing....hahahhahaha
cool  race
The only Team that can beat Mercedes is Mercedes, if they fix their errors Red Bull has No chance. Last time at the restart Ham made a mistake and lost out on points today IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE giving points away like cookies. Hamilton is absolutely a Goat of driver and no one can touch this Guy when things go right at their Gararge.
Amateur moves by Bottas and Stroll. Bottas actually braked then accelerated then braked again when he was in a braking zone 🥴
I'm so impressed by Alonso! Just WOW! He's a real fighter. Just a shame that DRS steals most duel from us..
Its getting past a joke now. Lewis gets favors done for his race after race.
This race was epic
I feel like bottas did it in purpose to take out red bull team out from the race
Seb lost his podium😭😭😭😭
GG Ocon 👏
No one mentions about the class of Hamilton. Casually went from P14 into podium places.
Russell finally scores first points for williams but latifi outscores him, will his bad luck ever end 😭
So much drama, this is not a race, this is a soap opera.
The ONE RACE I do not watch…
Great drive from Ocon to get his first F1 win but hats off to Lewis what a fantastic come back
Vettel: "Gets an excellent 2nd place at Hungary"  FIA: "Well yes but actually no, heres a disqualification instead"
Instead of F1 change the name as H1..let's Hamilton wins all..ok now how we take out Ocon from first..plz comment guys..let's F1 get the idea to make Hamilton first...we need more support
Hamilton : Enemy missing !! Bottas : Well played !!
Im new to F1 started in 2018 and i have to say thats the first time i ever seen a team work together, offense and defense amazing Alonso is still the best driver all time to me great win Alpine
Bottas probably got a big bonus for that bone head move.
Bottas is a great teammate 😂
Bottas is really gonna do whatever it takes to keep that Mercedes contract. I bet he'll give Lewis a nice foot rub with a happy ending after the race.
Mercedes 🦶🦶🦶👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 cheating strategy
Red Bull also lost pace to the Mercedes I think too.
Ricciardo wins that race if stroll brakes
Need to see Norris braking telemetry before bashing Bottas…
Well I watched that video but I still have no clue what happened in the race. Every clip was like watching an entirely different GP lol.
Formula One: has a crazy Race Liberty Media: C O N T E N T
06:14. Jesus Christ, why is he shouting. Calm down ffs.
Poor seb
Sos horrible ricciardo
Alonso moved 3 times
I think that valtery should get one race ban
Definitly in the top 10 strangest F1 races. Bottas : Red Bull hit man !
I've seen it all now . Completely rigged . I'm done with sport
Alonso is the real chad
I voted Bottas driver of the day
10 second penalty to drivers for risking each other’s lives but a disqualification to Vettel for not having the right amount of fuel in the car. Honestly the FIA hate Seb
For once something that wasn't mazepins fault
I don't want to watch FIA do anything to make Hamilton WDC!!! Common, I want vettel's P2
Oh look Verstappen turning in on someone again :P
I think Hamilton has found his groove though.
Once again its verstappen that is making contact
mercedes: Bottas we need Lewis and Mercedes leading the drivers and Constructors championship for you to get a new contract.  Bottas: Say No More.
What a race!   *Ocon flawless after taking the lead in the restart❤*  *Alonso fencing off attack after attack, enough for Alpine to win the race❤*  *Max fighting for the point of his life in a half-broken car❤*  *Lewis fighting back from last to P3❤*  *A tear-soaked Russel after achieving P9❤*  👌🏽
Oh I would not have been able to watch this race with Rosberg on here. It’s painful listening to him here.
Alonso really won the race for ocon like that is not even a joke i mean Hamilton cut 4 or 5 secs in the last 3 laps. And that's a year by f1 standards.
I'm sure Mercedes is saying, crashing Red Bull's cars race after race with little to no consequence is like taking candy from a laughing baby's mouth 00:37
ridiculous
James: “Valtteri, its James…”  Valtteri: “Oh no”  James: “Execute Order Red Bull”  Valterri: *phew*  Edit: Russell is just cursed… I hate to say it… he can’t catch a break. Also SEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBB!!!!
I have the F1 TV app, and riding on board with LH at the restart, the team let him down.  When LH was coming around the pit entry onto the start box, he told his engineer that those "behind me are pitting". His engineer should have told LH to get to the start box quickly so the lights could trigger for him to start. Instead, I counted at least 7 seconds for LH to approached his grid spot slowly, like a normal start, once he was stationary, the lights triggered and went out. If only LH approached his grid box much quicker, it would have released him while everyone was still in the pitlane.
Alonso deserves more appreciation
What Mercedes  has to do to get Verstappen out of the best places or to get him out of the race. Its a real shame.
Alonso deserves 1/3 of that P1. Ocon got the P1 and defended it from Vettel, Alonso defended it from Hamilton.
Lewis: YMCA helped motivate me in the qualification Toto to Valtteri in formation lap: we are putting on Miley Cyrus now Valtteri.
What a day to be a russell fan
Bottas gets a 5 grid position penalty for taking 2 potential rivals out that directly benefits him and his team mate goes on to seize the lead in DC. The 'Stewards' didn't see that perspective at Silverstone ??? Or was it because it was Valtteri this time and Mercedes didn't care 🤔  "Michaaal " "Go Toto" "I didn't send you an email..."
So let me get this right. Bottas goes bowling, in effect takes out 2.5 cars and only gets a 5 grid penalty? Meanwhile, Seb runs out of gas because he probably ran a bit less fuel than he should and gets disqualified? Sure, the FIA partiality towards AMG Merc F1 does not exist. Sure.
I'm delighted for Ocon.
Alonso protected ocon From Lewis 🤣🤣
I wonder how it would've looked if Hamilton had pitted as well at the restart. "It's lights out and nobody goes."
BREAKING: Christian Horner submits appeal, after Lewis Hamilton is promoted to 2nd
Alonso schooled Hamilton
1000% that bottas did this extra
I had no idea Hungary is the second home to Mercedes.
Why disqualify Vettel for not having enough fuel but only give a 10 second penalty to Hamliton for ending someones race in a very dangerous way. maFIA
1:19 Lewis and his friends
Imagine if Bottas messed up at the start and hit Hamilton.
And now Seb is disqualified for 700ml too little fuel but Bottas causes millions in damages and hales out several cars and gets a 5 place grid penalty for the next race…. FIAMG
Very Happy for Ocon, Sainz and Lewis!!!
Bottas is torpedo 2.0
Pff Lewis couldn't overtake Fernando with a Mercedes for laps...this guy is ridiculous :D the great champ...
What a defense by Alonso
Bottas better keep his seat for next year since he listened to Toto and Hamilton on taking out the Red Bulls.
I always like seeing Vettel on the podium.
the battle between alonso and hamilton just proves again that alonso still has so much potential after all these years, much respect for the legend himself
poor seb, he deserves p2
Mercedes Benz is killing my interest in watching F1.   How is a team that cheats to take its competitor out with every opportunity allowed to participate. What a bunch of sorry losers. I hope they lose sponsors next year. Or better, just leave the sport.  I have no feelings for Redbull, but the last few races made me very upset.
Valtteri, schieb ihn raus!
Great race for Alpine
5 place penalty for Bottas was not enough. He should be banned for one race. Mercedez are playing nasty.
Please, stop screaming!   Awesome race 👍🏻
Every pilot; Nobody can hold Lewis for more than a lap... Alonso; Hold my beer.
Toto to Bottas: execute order 66.  Bottas:
Before I watch this, I can tell from like/dislike ratio that Hamilton didn't win.
Bottas is so bad in wet conditions unbelievable
Bottas legit took 4 cars out that could race with lewis 😂😂😂 great tactics there Mercedes
Dislike for Vettel DSQ
What a criminal move by Stroll, what was the guy thinking
Russel on P2 i couldn't stop laughing after that restart
So did Bottas get his new contract signed tonight? It looks like he put in the hard work today
Bottas ain't a torpedo, he is a cruise missile at this race 🚀
糞みたいなレースだな。糞レースになった原因はボッタスだと思う。彼はメルセデスのような上位チームにいるべきではない。  It's a dung-like race. The cause of the dung race was Bottas. He shouldn't be on a higher team like Mercedes.
Very weird had Perez out, and verstappen damage. Strange.
Occon was Wrong Alonzo is as …… Bad as he’s heard…..It is that HE IS NOT BLACK… Yeh I said it…there are a lot of UNOPENED CLOSETS THAT ARE HAND-me -down RACISTS… Check it.. no-0ne EVER ELABORATES talks about LEWIS’S EPIC FEAT OF DRIVING…let’s face it we are normally plagued by the lot-of you….a pestilence on thre firmament
Bottas is a real teammate. Taking one for the team by taking out both Red Bulls so that Lewis can go ahead in the championship.
P2 Hamilton...Very pleased.
Nico's comments bring a new perspective to the race strategy and passing tactics. I like that. He also predicted Ocon's win.
One day Mazepin will have an incident free race  When he isn't in it...
Yes…..thanks for the highlights, but was an email sent?
what an absolute fairy tale of a race from both sides of the alpine garage. Amazing. Both williams into the points too, a dream come true
Beautiful strategy by mercedes
0:41 Halo saved Charles Leclerc in F2 and now in F1 also
HUGE CONGRATS TO OCON AND RUSSEL FOR GETTING HIS FIRST POINTS!!!! THAT WAS FANTASTIC!
You gotta give it to the guy, that was beautifully precise to take out both redbulls, dude sniped them out
CARLOSS BRAVIISISIMO P3
That hamilton-alonso battle must be up there for one of the best battles of the season so far, maybe even of the last few seasons actually.
Today was the best and wildest race ever
Bottas DESERVES to be suspended for 1 race for that crash.
@1:18 When you come to work on bank holiday.
now this is a joke for me, I've just  the article that Vettel disqualified
Youtube is full of trolls and haters man.
Everyone else talking about alpine me screaming RUSSEL in my room
June 1955 Mercedes F1 car left the track killing 80 people, now we are seeing them frequently in significant crashes perhaps they never learn.
Bottas... Sbinalla
mercedes is on purpose to smash redbull?
Vettel fighting for victory, Hamilton fights with Alonso, Räikkőnen is out.  Schumacher is struggling. What year we have?
Hats off to Lewis, well done Ocon and George Russel is going to the future world champion. Mark my word.
Lewis: Takes another driver at 200 mph out and gets a 10 sec. Penalty. Seb: Pump is not able to pump more than 0.3 Litre out of his car, gets disqualified from the Race and loses his podium.
All my childhood I watched pretty much every F1 race live on TV. And after at least 3-4 years of turning my back to watching F1 due to Mercedes dominance, I decided to watch the last two races live, since I like Verstappen. And both races he got bowled out lol. What a dissapointment.
Here after seb's disqualification.... day ruined 😔
Hey, Russel got his points in a Williams.. 😅
Couldn’t stand the crying from Hamilton everytime he couldn’t pass someone inmediately. Such a loser
Williams scoring points 😮
SEB IS P2
All things considered, Stroll is lucky Bottas is taking all the flak…
La mejor carrera que haya visto
This video could have been an hour long
When Lewis Hamilton appears in your mirrors and One-winged Angel plays 👀
HAM Buhhh👎👎👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
Hamilton = Steven Bradbury, his luck is beyond belief.
Awesome race. Unexpected fight from Alonso with Hamilton. Awesome comeback from Hamilton. I am a mercedes fan. But when i see midfield teams racing with top 3 teams. I will always enjoy that!
Mercedes has massive budget so they can just start smashing other cars, kinda brilliant
Vettel disqualified for not enough fuel in the car at the end 😭
5 places grid penalty for a little bowling for Bottas but a 10 sec penalty for a 52G accident at Silverstone for Hamilton 🤡🤡🤡
Anyone else who is ready for drive to survive 2021 on Netflix?
Merces, Una lastima Si pensar mal, se ve la intención de chocar con los RB.
Lewis sent Max into the barriers at 180 mph and now complains about Alonso! Absolute disgrace.
Imagine disqualifying someone for lacking 0.7l of fuel but giving 10s penalty for taking out a race and championship leader 🤧🤡
A happy Sunday for Alpine and Williams
Haha restart race xd i Think this restart dont will be
Hamilton now second. Wohooo
Mercedes was never more proud of Bottas!
Bottas's actions today really drive home the fact that he's going to get replaced by Russell  next year.
Máx solo es bueno adelante viniendo desde atras fue opacado, en cambio Pérez ah echo remontadas desde muy atrás, lastima que hoy no se pudo.
Hamilton is goat 🐐
Toto: one dnf for Verstappen will get us in contention  Bottas: one for each race for Redbull
Bottas out Russel in …. Love from 🇿🇼🇿🇼🇿🇼
Poor Vettel got disqualified 😭
Crazy race...
Bottas would certainly be retained by Mercedes for 2022 for his superb performance in helping the team win the championship again this year!
Ocon is a lucky driver in this race
Mercedes Strategie hat ja fast sehr gut funktioniert Bottas hat seinen Job als Puffer extrem stark gemacht. Aber es ist wirklich schön zu sehen das Ocon mal auf dem Treppchen ist und auch Vettel es mal wieder geschafft hat
Disappointed for seb getting dq he drove an amazing race
as i understand, vettel is disqualified ... thus LH has finished 2nd .. i will wait some more minutes until the FIA will find a reason to disqualify OC .. then LH will have won the race ( which seems to be FIA's prefered outcome )
What a race
Cheap play by mercedes like always... No wonder we see them at the top of the table everytime... If you can't win your opponent fair just push them out of the track...
Vettel dsq means Swiss Alfa Romeo team/their finnish driver Kimi Mattias Räikönnen gain one point out of todays race. The best of story? Today was swiss national birthday! A nice birthday gift so
Congrats for russel and latifi
Toto be like: "why'd you not take out verstappen bottas?"
HORNER: baby Max P10, P10 congratulations  Baby Max: 😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
How can the FIA take this away from Seb. I dont get how running out of fuel can warrant a DQ.
WILLIAMS DOUBLE POINTS FINISH WILLIAMS DOUBLE POINTS FINISH WILLIAMS DOUBLE POINTS FINISH WILLIAMS DOUBLE POINTS FINISH
Bottas: Bowling is crazy time!
Nico must stay.
uuf si que se la lucio hamilton en esta carrera wow
T: "Valterri, it's Toto" V: "Yes, Master" T: "Execute Order 66" V: "It will be done, my Lord"
Feeling sad for seb not gonna lie
They DQd Vettel🥲
maFIA!!!
Too many yikes in one race to meme
Mercedes tactics to get Lewis top 👏 can't believe they wreck RB twice 😏
Bottas indeed is the best wingman. Lucky hamilton as always
Shame on mercedes and its drivers
Max just chilling turns in then bam Lando takes him out.
So Vettel excluded for racing so hard for a win he used .7 of a litre too much fuel!  We have stop go penalty for a pit lane infringement, then another 10 second penalty for a different infringement.  Yet 2 weeks ago a penalty for running someone  off the track still allows the offender to win, and causing an accident this week,  that leads to six cars retiring,  is a five place penalty, which could mean next yo no time lost.  What is the FIA thinking off, because it doesnt seem the penalty fits the crime in too many cases.
Aw Seb! FIA have disqualified Aston Martin for failing the mandatory fuel test at the end of a race.
Vettel disqualified! Lewis Hamilton finished second. 🤣🤣
One of the Best Race ever!!!
Talk about nothing else than sheer luck. If it wasn't for the crash in the begining, this would be just another boring F1 race with same results everyone got used to.
Vettel has been disqualified. FIA unable to take mandatory fuel sample from his car 1. Ocon  2. Hamilton 3. Sainz
F for Vettel
Hamilton GOAT, as simple as it is
If it wasn't't for Alonso defending himself and not letting Lewis pass by, Econ's win today would have been way cut throat close.
FIA 👎
Hamilton on the starting grid all by himself. He must be thinking that he is in a sim race and lost connection to the server!
I have to point out Max’s contact with the Haas driver on the overtake, it even is the rear wheel contact that Hamilton did on him. Hamilton haters and Max’s fanatics argue that it was not the move, but rather where he made it.  In the end it is time to let it go as Max himself said so.
Otra vez MERCEDES,.
This season is maybe one off the most dramatic season ever congratulation for ocon for you maiden win
Well, having had the experience of racing on a wet, oily surface myself, AND in the rain where visibility is compromised, I put the blame on the weather. But I get it, blame Lewis, blame Bottas and Mecedes. The "in" thing now.
Top race ❗👍💪
Red Bull has to bring "ping-pong" back to rival the new "bowling" strategy by Mercedes
Bottas coming up with a new method to make sure he has a seat for next year at Mercedes.
Sebastian F
Why wasn’t this guy the commentator on the f1 channel, it was utter garbage without him.
Another kamikaze from mercedes to take out RB. Disgrace to the sport
RIGGED
Toto rubbing his hands “well done bottas just as we planned”
Bottas following strict team orders to take out the competition to save his Mercedes seat. He should have been DSQed for the season, Hamilton doesn't deserve this championship
Vettel got DQ'd because he made Hungary and FIA look bad because he showed off his T shirt
Bottas is a Hero xd
Breaking news : after his great race Bottas signed a new  long time contract with Mercedes
Not to take away from this amazing race, but how lucky can Hamilton be... poor Max.
6:19 Not anymore, DQ
Another race for red bull to blame Lewis ? Go on Horner I dare ya
Now...I don't watch a lot of racing...but that has got to be one of the rarest things ever...a race start with 1 person out.  What??  I wouldn't have even thought that was possible.  This blew my mind like watching Pastrana do a backflip on a motorcycle the first time ever.
😷
WHAT A RACE!!!!
Es enserio que descalificaron a vettel?.
“Well done Valtteri, you secured your 2022 seat. Oh and by the way did you get my email?”  - Toto
MaFia
Somehow the haters at Red Bull will blame the GOAT aka Lewis Hamilton for this crash. Just saying 🤷🏽‍♂️!
"Lights out and away we go for Lewis Hamilton only " Hamilton "yes it's dry" 😂😂
Crashgate 2.0
Wow
"Très bon, très bien and formidable !" Yes i'm happy too for France lol well deserved Alpine ! And GG to Vettel as well but still super worried for Ricciardo...
Can we just appreciate Rosberg’s commentary the whole race! He gave insights from a modern F1 perspective
Bear in mind that Vettel was disqualified after the race because his car had no fuel for the stewards' sampling.
really the fight between alonso and hamilton was worth watching it was a great match thanks f1
Seeing Hamilton waiting for the lights to go out alone was the funniest and the most random thing I've seen today
Please tell me Botas got driver of the day
Alonso: THIS IS SPARTA!!
The iron wall of Spain 🇪🇸 💪🏽
Bottles took one for the team. He took out multiple cars for the his team mate.
Hamilton: "Why does nobody in the fanbase like me? Be like the other drivers. The drivers like me, the whole grid likes me!"  The grid: 1:18
"Bottas is so skilled guys, I swear he will win the championship this season and prove everyone wrong." >And 99 more jokes you can tell to your friends.
Toto warned about more crashes ! No surprise !
Masterful Touch of Driving From The Spaniard . . . La Furia Roja . . . Alonso
No seb is DSQ
This is becoming ridiculous. Bottas takes out 3 main competitors and is given a 5 place grid drop for next race? Really? I remember vettel had been taken away his win because he came out from the grass in front of ham. How is this sh*** less punishable? maFIA
Poor vettel :(
Vettel has been disqualified 😤
vettel has been disqualified . hamilton 2nd . not enough fuel in vettel's car for a sample .
Alonso robbed Bottas off Driver of the Day imo.
Alonso masterclass driving. He is beast.
Man those V-stap fans are sour with all that booing and terrible show put on by Redbull upper management. RB deserve their bad Karma to continue. Merc class act - never forget those aero rules were built against Merc.
Ah such a shame for Seb
Mercedes tactics... Hamilton spins Verstappen, Bottas takes out half the field, FIA disqualifies Seb... It's a CONSPIRACY
Nico was brilliant on commentary today
Чумовая гонка!
Poor Seb
Really feelin for seb right now. Just sad
Bottas crashes race : 5 grid penalty Ham: crashes race 10 second penalty for a Top 3 car.  As Alsonso said F1 is a yoke.  And now with the DQ for Seb this starts to really smell like a Merc and Fia buttbudies
Disqualifying Vettel for not having fuel left in his tank is not the most popular move… @FIA
That’s what I call unpredictable. And we have BOTTAS to thank for it.
Mercedez will soon run out of game plans Like that race start
Breaking News! Wolff has confirmed new strategy from Silverstone. Since they can't win with fairplay they installed the "Bumper-car" plan!
Most memorable Crofty line ever:  "it's lights out and away we go... for Lewis Hamilton ONLY!"
can we talk about seb plz?
MaaaaaaaaaaaaaaFIA
Here after they disqualified Vettel.
Hamilton=Mercedes💪
Stolen from Seb😭
Imagine getting your first points in F1 only for your teammate to outscore you. Awesome job from Latifi today.
What an unfortunate start for the top teams. Crazy start for the whole field
It was an amazing race. Of course Lap 1 T1 was ... bad!! But we need/want 22 races like this and not 3 or 4 out of 22.
Mazepin always make me laugh🤣
Baby CRASHSTAPPEN fanboys are still cryin 😂🤣😂🤣 where’s your baby max?! Oh 10th place! 😭😭😭😭😂🤣😂🤣😂
Mercedes : Hey Fia, we didn't won. What gone wrong?  Fia: Ok, let's DSQ Vettel at least.
If i knew then what i know now i would have chosen another day to go for that date. This race was fireworks!!
Williams scoring double.😭😭💙💙we can finally die in peace.
This is a joke
Alonso is the dirtiest degenerate ever to grace the sport. Not even Max drives that unfairly and he has so much more to lose. Max defends aggressively but he doesn't deliberately go out of his way to drive others to the edge of the track (yes I remember Imola but that was partly Lewis' fault). I'm flabbergasted as to why FIA allowed that man to return. Pffft. I am upset as you can clearly tell because before this race I thought that Max's race craft at times was a bit underhanded - boy was I wrong - but that has-been takes the cake. I respect Max as a competitor, a driver, a sportsman, a man even way more now.   Next race Max, we'll do better for sure! Kudos to Ocon and Vettel for the upset in today's Hungarian Gran Prix. A well deserved hyper active 2021 Formula One season!
Mercedes should be kicked out this is not racing
Masterclass in overtaking by Lewis and a lesson in defense by Alonso, both brilliant 👏
I saw hundreds of memes saying max is going to become a bulldozer in this race. Then Bottas comes in and kicks both the redbulls in the nuts. Are you not entertained? 🤣🤣🤣
i wish the plague upon all the merc crew :)
WHY DONT SHOW ALL FIGHT ALO VS  CRIED HAMILTON
We want more Nico Rosberg! Have him commentating at every race!
scenes if vettel won getting dsq after
After all the rumors about Russell getting Bottas’s seat for next season, Valteri is showing to Totto, Mercedes, and all his detractors that he has what it takes to keep that seat. He is proving that he is an absolute team player and the right team mate for Hamilton.
Cheap tactics from Mercedes to keep competitors out  If you can't defeat them just take them out of your way, wow 👎👎
Verstappen on himself "I don't think I'm an aggressive driver" anytime he struggle to pass some competitors he smashes into his car... sure, you're not aggressive at all... a real lord on track...
Vetel dsq😭
If Schumacher had a better car...
I can already see the title for this ep in Drive to survive. Hungary for a win :)
Valtorpedo Bottas
Why didnt farrari let Alonso get DRS ill never understand
So vettels disqualified for no fuel sample. Gutted!
TOTO: Today we will make our decision on 2022 as we will need some 4D chess from you for constructors points, Lewis' title hopes, and Lando's 3rd place in the championship. BOTTAS: Understood Team: Let us know if you are... BOTTAS: I am sorry guys that's it TOTO: Seat confirmed for 2022
What a beautiful, juicy race!  This was exactly what I was looking forward to in the winter once Alonso's comeback was announced ... knowing Alonso being in an underpowered car... seeing what he can do.  ALO vs HAM... got flashbacks to Monza 2011 MSC vs HAM...
lewis is goat...
Seb robbed honestly. George had no fuel aswell, where is his dsq?
Hamilton is now a lucky man🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
RB masterminds of stealing fasted laps from Lewis
Sanganos
FIA its a joke
I'm a Lewis fan, but Alonso is a proper driver.  The things he'd do in a competitive car! Also happy for Seb.
Can anyone please confirm the report on SPEED TV that Lewis needed intravenous fluids? They are reporting he was complaining of headaches and was dehydrated. I thought he didn't look well after that race. I hope the guy is not sick!
🅱️OTTAS                  G.O.A.T
maFIA
Bottas gets a new contract now until 2022 after his amazing performance today at the hungaroring
What a shambles! I have Neville have er seen anything like it in 50 plus years! The race should have been restarted in the same order at the time of the red flag. I switched off in disgust!
Vettel es p2😡😡🤡🤡😡😡😡💩💩💩
Sebastian Vettel disqualified
beautiful team work by mercedes to take the championship lead🤣
Is no one going to mention how Lewis cried when Alonso was defending?  "At that speed it's so dangerous to move around " What about last with Max at 300 kmh
What a race, and what season. Ham and Alonso was incredible, two of the best.
Mercedes master plan working  If u cant beat red bull cars,take them out.
Fernando Alonso is the real deal 👑 🇪🇸
ROBBED
Toto Wolff vai tirar o título do Hamilton esse ano com suas estratégias!!!!
Driver of the day Valteri Bottas
It's sad how people cheer for anything against Hamilton these days. Placing the spotlight on Alonso as if Alonso won or even beat Hamilton, which he did not.  That being said, Hamilton is going to need all the help he can to beat the Redbull if more unlucky events don't happen
WILLIAMS 10 POINTS, IT'S HAPPENING!!!!
Ngl i could watch Alonso vs Hamilton every weekend. Reverse grid when?
a
Congrats Seb, another podium in 2021, hope more success will come ❤️ Now 9th in driver championship with 48 points, though he's driving the 7th best car among all 10 teams 👏🏽
Hmm, so Mercedes isn't easily 1st this season. Last week they took out Max in a weird way, now Bottas just takes care of both Redbull and some collateral damage. Such a weird strategy they employ to get 1st back this season...
I love how Alonso became driver of the day in the span of around 6 laps. Shows how much he contributed to that Alpine win.
Poor Vettel losing P2 :(
No1 can beat Ocon on wet ground
Red Bull is finish......
Nice strategy from bottas take out 2 redbulls for the price of 1
Seb gets disqualified for being short 700ml of fuel for a sample but Hamilton only gets a 10 second penalty for taking out another driver???
maFIA
James : Valtteri it's James Bottas: What's the matter? James: Russel has been doing pretty well in that Williams! Bottas: Why are you telling me this? We're on the Formation Lap. Do you have any Info on the race for me? James: No reason, just chatting. Looks quite wet out there. Wouldn't it be a shame if something were to happen to the Red Bulls at the start of the race again, huh? Bottas: Why you asking? James: No reason particular, but it might easily happen if someone were to lock up on entrance of the first corner, don't you think?
The guy came from 14 to 3rd👏
How did Stroll escape penalty?!!!
@formula1 nice move with Vettel, this again your way to further promote Mercedes and Hamilton? Looks a bit too suspicious lately how Hamilton is being favoritized…the 8th title seems to be obtained at all cost…for better marketing
Vettel was robbed!
I cant tale the FIA SERIOUS ANYMORE! How can they dsq seb for havin only 0.3liters for the prove but hand bottas only a 5place grid penalty this doesnt male sense at all.
Sebastian Vettel has been disqualified after the race!!! The Race stewards were unable to take the required amount of fuel for sampling following the race!
Nobody gonna talk about how RUSSEL IS IN THE POINTS!!!!!
Vettel DQ, Hamilton P2 lol
Alonso pure genius .. What a champion driver.. He stopped Lewis from winning the race and only he can do what he did on a hard tyre.. Older tyre and Slower car .. Eventually Lewis did pass him but by then it was too late
The sad thing is i didn't see it and now all i get to watch is the 7 minutes highlights
Nearly shedded a tear when I heard Vettel has been Disqualified. I have faith in him he'll stand on the podium at some point in the second half of the season
Bottas = wage increase!
I love the drivers are way more mature than a LOT of the fans.
cancele mi suscripción a F1 TV, esta mierda ya parece lucha libre!! Falta nomas que salga Vince a descalificar a Verstappen y a entregarle el título a Mercedez  Impresionante el nivel de arreglo y trampa, ni en las Libertadores de los 80 se robaba tanto
Formula 1 is a terrible sport, it makes absolutely no sense, perpetrators win, victems loose, and justice is far, far away.
it's funny to see the difference between this comment session and the one with  the highlights in portuguese. Lewis is truly so aprecciated in Brazil, everyone is happy to see an incredible race and amazing performances from Steban, Lewis, Fernando and the Williams boys. The Brazilian audience knows how to enjoy this sport
Well... it was fun while it lasted, too bad Lewis is going to do what he always does after the Summer break 4wins a couple podiums a championship
"Valtteri, it's James" "Copy, James"
Amazing race! One of the best races I have seen, everything has happened.
2:26 any guesses on what does Guenther says here?
Great race! I love those crazy wet races that produce totally different results
F1 open lobbies be like
I hope Merc gives Bottas a bonus...
Breaking News : Sebastian Vettel has been disqualified cause the officials couldn't get the sample of fuel needed ( 1 liter ). There were able to get only 0.3 liter. Which means the race results goes as follows : Ocon P1; Hamilton P2; Sainz P3.  Sad news
Such an overwhelmingly eventful race jesus! Great job to everyone in the top 10! And especially Alonso and Ocon.
1:17 i really not understand If i go to school but still sunday, and there class only cricket sound😑😑😑😑
Gotta feel for red bull after yet another mistake from merc costing red bull points
Vettel disqualified is a joke fia!
ALONSO, what a boss!!! And it was a joy to watch the celebration with OCON!
Is this really gonna be mercedes new tactic?! Sorry but I’d rather see Max on that podium with a clean race, then one of the Mercedes bumping into cars.
What race Ocon did
Ocon! You are on Sennas level in my mind.
It's nice seeing vettel back at it again after all this season
It should not be possible that the leader of the championship gets eliminated like it happened to Verstappen. Millions of dollars worth of damage, and potentially 52 points for the championship down the drain in just two races. Not to mention the exploding tire for Verstappen in Baku. Making the difference in points even greater. It feels very unfair. There should be bigger consequences for those who cause the elimination and all the damage from their direct rival.   For example it is possible to ad the costs from the caused damage to the budget cap from the team that caused the accident and the damage. Hard racing will still be possible, but the drivers and the teams have to share the risk of it when it goes wrong.   Right now it is too easy to cause a big accident, on purpose or not, and say that it was an accident, and to get away with it while damaging the direct rival without any long term consequences. While the team that was eliminated has to pay for all the damage and that team is also losing valuable championship points.
Driver of the day: BOTTAS.
CEO of Alpine: "I don't think Ocon is world champion material" Vettel haters when he breaths: "He's washed and trash" Alonso haters: "He's too old and never gonna be at his prime again"  I just wanna know, where at the haters now?...
Awesome
MaFIA
The man who retired last seven-times -champion made the current seven-times-champion a whining little girl in the same car🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mate Vettels second place is gone because of not enough fuel. He is also under investigation for wearing a top during the anthem
Vettel disqualified…..
Alonso is still a bed man!
Vettel DSQ. I mean come on.🤦‍♂️
Racist remarks towards Bottas incoming??
That move from Bottas should secure him an contract extension! :D
pain for vettel
Next race: Mercedes safety car takes out both red bull drivers on first lap.
Bottas the ultimate team player 🤣
4:45 Hamilton tried his signature move but missed.
It feel as if Mercedes is sabotaging Red Bull now….
Stroll.. your mom's very well known
Mercedes: you need to kick out Red Bull Bottas: which one? Mercedes: both. Bottas: ...  Bottas: Hold my beer
is it me, or are these guys like rookies on online racing where they can't seem to get past the first lap?  just saying the first laps have been some of the worst in years this year.
Oh wow, I had no idea Verstappen was involved in that first lap accident. No wonder he was stuck back in the pack all race.
The track only dried out when Verstappen stopped crying.... again! What a 🔔 End 🖕
What a race!!! I love seeing the podium mixed up like that
Karma awaits Mercedes so unprofessional what bottas did. It's all about Hamilton to win bad sport
Vettel disqualified for fuel sample issue: maFIA helping Ham as usual  SMH FIA
Vettel Robbed
Crazy watching the start if you imagine Bottas started that way just to hit both red bulls....
Hamilton-Mercedes partnership is unstoppable. Its scary they almost got the first.
Mercedes: Valeri, what would you be ready to do to stay in our team? Bottas: How about I kick out closest competition to help my "friend" win the title...again?
BOTTAS fez de propósito, ele poderia ter pisado no freio !
If I were a steward, I would have suggested giving Bottas at least 4 license penalty points.
Really convenient that bottas hit bolth Red Bull’s
If this wasn't the best race possible, I don't know what it is
Nico Rosberg should join the broadcast team. He was excellent in commentary and analysis today!
This is insane! A 1-car start. I've never seen that before.
I have to say that speedin in pitlane gets a higher penalty than unsafe release is really weird
Just got to the end of race, was happy seb got p2 then got an f1 notification telling me that it was stripped from him due to a fuel sample issue
MAN this grand prix was something
Mercedes already thinking about how take out both Red Bulls without losing Bottas
Great racing between Alonso and Hamilton, but Hamilton should stop complaining  ! It was hard but fair racing from Alonso  ! It's what we want to see !
poor seb being disqualified :-(
That's EXACTLY why I would love to see a Reverse Grid start in F1.
I just wonder what was Stroll doing on the grass
Vettel deserved that podium, I do t care what anyone else says
Merc keeps cheating... And the maFIA keep their eyes well closed... Perfect tandem.
The perfect cameo was done by The Rain Gods.. just enough to have that carnage in the beginning and then "aight imma outta here"
Before Silverstone 21-RB r leading the constructor's championship Max leading the driver's championship Lewis crasheax at Silverstone which results in dnf and wins the race Hungaroring 21-Bottas causes chaos which results in Max's crash and he comes 10th with a damaged car. Now,mercs and Lewis r leading in constructor's and driver's championship respectively. I WON'T SAY ANYTHING MORE ☹️
No wonder Aston Martin (7th) couldn't pass Alpine, the 4th best car team of F1 2021 🤓
... And remember, Bottas, it has to look like an accident.
Bottas to toto: mission accomplished boss.  Toto to bottas: exzellent, job vell done.
Please get rid of Nico….. he’s nobody to listen to. Just a crybaby…
Who had Ocon wins with Alpine and Bottas goes bowling, on their 2021 BINGO card?
Merc: Botas, torpedo mode, torpedo mode.
Seb getting disqualified for not having enough fuel sample after the race is such a joke.
I want to say that was a beautiful podium but there is ham
Drive to survive is gonna be sick
Absolutely amazing grand prix!! Bravo Esteban! 😎🍾
Congratulations to Ocon from Mexico
Esos cabrones de Mercedes nada más hacen su desmadre chocando en cada carrera son bien tramposos y la día  no los castiga como debe ser para que dejen de hacer sus marroñerias
Seb got disquallified :/
Vettel disqualification 😔😔
Bottas the new Torpedo
You gotta love racism.if it was Hamilton the insults would be amazing
Vettel lost in pitstop. If they did it in 2.8 intead of 3.3 he would be in front of Ocon
And for the second year in a row, Bottas goes tumbling down the order in Hungary in the wet... What a washed clown.
Magnifique, Sublime. Victoire française sur une voiture française! Merci Esteban!
That Turn 1 was like F1 2021 online lobbies
botas : tooks out both RB and then some  toto and friends : here you go king you dropped this
Alonso in Redbull.
What about Lewis afraid of Alonso: “It’s so dangerous at these speeds” Did he really think that the stewards would fall into that trap?
Thanks 🙏.  🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
NOOOOO SEBBBBB
Bottas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who’s here after Seb got DQ’d
Last News:  Vettel has been DSQ out of the Race. Cuz the FIA Couldn t  take a 1L of the fuel
Was Rosberg a commentator at this GP ???
Thats  why Lewis is the best driver ,might’ve came 3rd ,he out drove Max easily
Russell's luck is the worst, but mazepinnnnn 😂😂, how???
Im just here to dislike after Sebs disqualification
Alonso in best car = 10x World Champion
Alain Prost and Fernando Alonso, the greatest professors in F1 history.
1:19 When you look at a replay of your Mario Kart Wii time trial lap
Bottas gets off to an amazingly slow start and then ended up taking out the Red Bull cars by rear ending Norris into the corner. Should that be considered an "accident"?
It's official guys: Vettel is disqualified and that means P2 for Hamilton, P3 for Sainz
And now Vettel ist dsq
Hamilton did give a race today..but it shall always remain hollow without max in his tail...bootass did a mean thing
Alonso in Petrov mode.  Life is full of those little ironies. Greta job for Alpine Team!
Keep Rosberg as a commentator
Does it look like bottas did that on purpose? I just started watching F1 so I don’t really know
No Vettel disqualifies 😭
This confirms how the team works for "The Hyena" Hamilton, what a predetermined action of Bottas, but how intelligent, takes out of the race those who can fight. They said, I lose a minor "Hyena", there is NO problem, there may be injuries, it does NOT matter, the purpose is for the older "Hyena" to separate, just like the behavior of the "Hyenas" herd. What a shame for the sport, I have followed Formua 1 for more than 50 years, and at this moment I want to totally disconnect from this disgusting Tournament, which is disgusting as a person.
I thought Finns were famous for car control. If there were team orders I would say Bottas executed them perfectly. Next race watch Perez take out entire Mercedes team including Toto. LOL
What a race
Man, Schumi did hold up Max tho And amazing battle from Alonso, like the old days, pretty sure he was happy with it
Poor russel, he will have to stay another season at Williams because Bottas already has secured his seat for next year
And the synopsis of the race is all thanks to the natural chaos that is this mysterious pre race rain that happened. Where did that come from. Been 50+ track temps all weekend and NOW it wants to rain? Well least it setup for this race. Also, WILLIAMS GETS POINTS, FINALLY
This is the way Mercedes are. They should be ashamed, at least apologize to their title rivals
If you cannot beat them, you can always throw them out, great plan MB!
I know this may be an irrelevant comment, but I swear I hope Verstappen sends Hamilton off the track the next opportunity he gets. I can’t stand Lewis.
Look at Hamilton at the podium. Not my favorite but this isn’t okay. He needs to enjoy the podium not be scared to spray his Champagne and get hate for it. Come on guys..
Bottas idiot
LH/MB the GOAT
Take out the lead tech teams and you get a proper F1 challenge  Thanks Bottas Glad nobody got hurt tho
the new Mercedes 1 2  first they take out 1 Red Bull now they take out 2 amazing ..
Don’t get angry at Valterri, he was only following orders
Totto: Valteri? Botas: yes Totto: Hammer time
lewis nocks max everyone: serious bottas nocks the whole crew everyone: hhhaahah so funny lol
Amazing race. Lewis would’ve won if he pitted at the start but I don’t get why Mercedes keep making the wrong desicions like putting 3+ laps later that the red bulls which gives max an advantage but he still did well to get back to p3 from last
ANYBODY BUT HAMILTON
0:53 were is Phil swift when you need him
После шестидесятого круга норм пошло дело
Bottas: I call this the "renovation move"...*takes two RBs out*...
Bottas, your bonus is in the mail
Mercedes wird noch ihre Strafe bekommen. Alles im Leben rächt sich.
Alonso defended very well,atleast he will break one record..retiring as the oldest guy in F1
Mercedes: "Execute Order 66." Bottas: "Yes James."
2021 The year Mercedes crashed their way to victory.  The fact a team can win like this is why F1 is still a joke. That said, I can't believe people cheered when Hamilton made a pass, everyone should be booing Mercedes every chance they get now. Also I'm not a Red Bull fan for anyone who might think there is fan bias involved. I was a Hamilton fan up until this year.
Alonzo cost himself a podium with vettel dsq by being that stubborn. He surely didnt care about ocon but did it out of pride. He could have saved a bit of tyre to easily overtake sainz. But i guess that is his champion mentality.
can somebody tell him to STOP SHOUTING?
1:30 that was the weirdest thing i have seen in 20 years of f1
Bottas didn't help Hamilton, he was on his way....red flag was a disaster
Red bull racing is the king Verstapen👑
Bottas is officially the best wingman ever...!!
That crash was what Lewis complained Ferrari as "interesting strategy" few years ago.
hammilton bulsht
Bottas needs to go. He is pathetic to watch and there are 17 other drivers on the grid more deserving of that seat. Should be a 5 place penalty for each race he ruined at the minimum. He hit the brakes so late he wouldn't have made that corner in the dry. An amateur move by a driver who has shown consistently he doesn't have what it takes. Time for him to go.
Why does this video came that? late :/
And now Vettel is disqualified ☹️
F1 is all about the car you have the best car you win any other f1 driver in that merc can win..... So unfair Anyway Alonso did great
1:19 This is how F1 looks like actually each race. Only one can win the title. Because it is paid.
Disappointed for mazepin wasn't his fault at all
Alonso, what an absolute UNIT
Hands down one of the best races for me. Phew!!
Hey Max let's go bowling -Valtteri Bottas F12021, GTA IV
And another weekend to forget for Red Bull thanks to Mercedes 👍 nice Strategy Toto 🤡
I guess Esteban is picking up Fernando's dinner check tonight. 😁
This is getting ridiculous. Fia needs to put massive penalties on mercedes.
What a rumble… that was a real battle.
So nice to see Seb in second place again! I sure hope he doesn’t get Disqualified because of a dumb rule regarding the fuel!
That Was exciting. What a race. More drama please
one of the best races i have seen in a while
Commentator: “Bottas took out both Redbull cars.”  As if it was staged considering what happened last race 😅
Aaahhh, Hamilton whining like the spoiled crybaby that he is behind Alonso... Music to my hears.
Нервные психи на трассе
Thank you alonso.
Mercedes: "Valtteri you know what to do. Protect our boy Lewis"  Bottas: "Say no more"
Max next race
It was all part of the toto master 🅱️lan
Bottas really is a team player 🤣
mickey mouse GP with a dose of bottas bowling
Hamilton is the goat. Its hilarious people even debate this
1:56 lol Crofty
Mercedes will crash their way to victory!
Prediction: Russell drives his heart out all season to completely dominate his teammate, ends up finishing the season with half the amount of points 🤣
Botas recontratado com sucesso
Russel embarassing behaviour.
Bottas takes out my favorite 3 drivers in a single corner. Incredible job! Hopefully that should most likely do it for Bottas driving a Mercedes in F1. See ya 👋 Bottas. You’ll have to hang on Lewis’s nuts in another car I hope.
Redbulls were 2nd and 3rd at one moment...Bottas really is the perfect second driver
The pits should be close until restart
Alonso....... enjoy this man guys, he will be missed when he is gone. What a legendary job he done on Ham just like he did on Schumi. Never underestimate Fernando the man is a beast.
Ботласс опять показал мастер класс
Where the crash between Lewis and Max on Silverstone was a racing accident. This was a terrorist attack. There is no reason why Bottas would want to sit in Lando's spray coming into the first corner. Just for visibility alone he would have always chosen the gap. This was premeditated from the start, no doubt in my mind!!!!!
Un-f*cking-believable
Ppl who didnt see thé full race dnt knw that Hamilton try for al most 7 laps with alonso ......wht à beast that Alonso
Clearly if you shout more during commentary it gets more exciting....
1 or 2 more laps and that would’ve been a win for Lewis, he was soooo much faster at the end. I’m not an alonso fan, but I can’t help but admire that defence…
Can we get a jolyon palmer analysis on that crash
Ojalá en español relataran igual
What a belter this race was after Azerbaijan. CLASS!! Alonso Hamilton battle was killer. Ocon finally a victory!! Vettel haha...smart racing.sly second well done buddy!!
Lewis couldn't win a race where he was the only one starting!!!!!! Hahahahahaha
From now on take out Hamilton.
Imagine turning on your TV right at 1:19 😅
OMEGALUL
1:24 is going to be my favorite image for some time :D lights out and away we go for Lewis Hamilton only xD
Russel: Finally scores first Williams points Latifi: Hold my beer
LETS GOOOO! SEBASTIAN VETTEL
I still don't understand why Hamilton didn't come in for tires with the rest of the field on lap 3... Had he done so, he would've won going away....
2:28 😂
Alonso absolutely played a blinder for the team if anyone is in doubt why he is there that performance shows why
Botas, this is James.... Botas: Ok.
It was a clucterfk!
Why did nobody switch to softs during the red flag but everybody pitted at the restart (except HAM)? Is it not allowed to change tyres during the red flag? The gamble would be worth it for all the bottom starters and would have paid off this time.
Somehow I`m starting to believe that Mercedes is punting cars on purpose
this is getting ridiculous now .......i mean come on man ....you really expect us to believe all this is random ...
Mercedes had bottas collide with multiple drivers and Lewis could still only manage 3rd
Everyone: red bull so unlucky.   Me: wayyyyyyy 2 races only 1 point.
If there is still anyone who doubts Lewis Hamilton, they should watch this race, honestly! One of the hardest tracks to overtake, Lewis was just made it look easy, although Alonso made him work for it.   Great race for sure!
We have to say 'Thank you Valtteri' for giving us a interesting race :)
Getting sick of Mercedes crashing their rivals out
Your opponent can’t score enough points, if you take them out every single race.                         Mercedes
Nicos commentary was elite here
ALONSO MVP, BLOCKED LEWIS FROM GETTING TO P1
BOYS RUSSEL IN THE POINTSS
Verstappen's so privileged that he can bang into others and get applauded for it .... hypocrisy
Mercedes: Bottas strat KILLRB Bottas: Verstappen or Pères this time? Mercedes: BOTH
fantastic run! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Home run : Bottas
2:51 it was a haas fault just like last time it was lewis' fault. You go king crashtapen
Bottas making himself useful to Mercedes to keep his seat
If Bottas doesn't get an automatic seat for next season I don't know what more he can do. He obeys team orders like a champion and torpedoes into the opposition like a kamikaze pilot.
4:48 they must have touched by mm there
Bottas did the best job for Mercedes he could possibly do
No one imagined that Alonso is the only midfield team car that can defend more aggressively that can hold mercedes into his back if he had the car
Driver of the Day: Valtteri Bottas, he gave us the race we always wanted
Ocon should give his trophies to Alonso, he won him that race
Another legendary performance by Alonso. Imagine Fernando having the same Mercedes as Hamilton does! I'm sure he would've won the title.
Why this commenter is always shouting?
All the season it was "poor bottas" and now it's the evil bottas 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Ocon is a such a great driver 👍❤😊
Toto: Plan 133! Execute order 133! Bottas: So car 33 in corner 1? Toto: Yes that’s right! Bottas: Copy that!
Man the podium was by seb , but oh well it was the First from Esteban , I'm glad he advanced so well  I hope that in the next race Seb will reach the much desired podium he deserves.
Shoutout to Gasly too because he managed to avoid damage in the first lap collision and went from back to P6! Quick maneuvering 👏
Mal
WHAT. A. RACE. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
It should rain at every event. There would be a different outcome in the World Championship.
I like the final result
HUGE UPSET!!!! Ocon and Alpine Big win thanks to Alonso. Major EPIC FAIL for Valterri "THE PORRIDGE POWERED FLYING TORPEDO" Bottas.
Get Rosberg out there
Alonso 🔝🔝
The AMG Hammer redefined.
Alonso VS Hamilton was some of the best racing we’ve seen this season
Bottas took out both redbull cars-  Hmmmmm new strategy by Mercedes
Botas you can go to carting..
What an GP!
And Mercedes gets away with it again
Mindig nagyszerű verseny: HUNGARORING! 🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺
this strategy seems to work great for mercedes ... hit max verstaepens car!!!!
Was ist Hamilton für ein scheiß Glücks Pilz
Toto: Michael, this is Toto I just sent you an e-mail with diagrams where Bottas should be.Did you receive that?
4:01 as here goes uheeheuheuaheuaehau backmarkers getting in the way
Bottas- sorry guys… Team- no worries, your cheque is in the post!!!
You could have showed a few more snippets of the Alonso vs. Hamilton action, that was epic. I laughed so much each time at that, it just goes to what a supreme driver Fernando is. How he held Hamilton at bay for so long while driving such an inferior car is amazing.
One important thing the replay not showing: Gasly taking fastest lap point out of Lewis on the very last lap.
I'm a life long Williams fan so I'm so pleased Latifi and Russell did great ❤
Well done vettel and Russle 👍👍👍👍
Where was brundle?🤔
Alonso is the GOAT
why doesn´t croft try shouting for a change... he is too calm
The silver torpedoes!
All F1 cars should be equally competitive. Then we can see the true talents of every driver.
One of the craziest races of all time
6:10 Pov: you are playing F1 2021 open lobby
One of my eye is crying because Mclaren disaster but the other is happy because we saw another chaotic race with surprise result!
Totto wolf stupidest manager ever and he prove that again hahahhah
Mas uma volta hemilton tinha ganhado a corrida pau nele hemilton
Mercedes is very faste then Ferrari
what a race omfg amazing
This is race of the season so far
Ocon won because Alonso defended Hamilton like it  was jesus
ALONSO = GOAT 🐐
Alonso did well holding Hamilton off to secure Ocon's first race win
The minor hobbies thankfully radiate because tail externally owe except a clear vegetable. old, lean letter
I wonder how much bottas got paid for turn 1
Bottas has just secured his spot on the team  for the next year
Los Mercedes son un puercos descarados
If you think Mercedes didn't do it on purpose you need to grow up..
BOTTAS IS KAMIKAZE. VERRY BAD
Que cerdo estuvo ese movimiento de bottas ya la MaFIA  quieren que afuerza gane Hamilton
Que corrida foi essa? Anos sem acompanhar F1 e agora voltei com tudo. Demais!
Max hitting Schumacher: I ! AM NOT! THE SON Of! YOUR DAD!
Lol when you can't beat em, just get your team mate to slam them off
Loved how alonso helped ocon to win what a team work
Epic race
Mercedes menage to take out in two races more cars than Max in his whole carrier and he has the nickname "crashstappen" lol
Mickey mouse win doesn't count
lewis just needed a few more laps to win!!!
"It's hammer time." ;) Wait was that you Valterri?
Ofc Mercedes would crash out their only competition
Its always verstappen colliding with someone but its never his fault is it
Bottas best wingman Hamilton could ever wish for
"f1 drivers are the best in the world" Why is there always a wreck on lap 1..
Bet Danny Ric is regretting his move now
Im sovsad poor norris he has a chance for me grateness and his 100% point scoring is now gone 😭
a 2.47 on en parle de Verstapen. Red bull ouvre leur bouche suite au contact avec Lewis au dernier GP. Et la il avait pas assez de place ???
Gandalf of the day: Alonso
The Hamilton and Alonso battle Ocon and vettel on podium  This is def one of the highlights of this season 👌👌
WILLIAMS HAS 6 POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!! I want every race to be like this>....
Poor Leclerc...
This race was awesome if you're not a Red Bull & Max fan😂😂
MARDITO NORRIS
So what happened to Verstappen's 10 second penalty for causing a collision??
i can't believe lewis's move on yuki was left out
Lewis: "Its dangerous at this speed" *Silverstone gp* "oh is it now?" I know i get much hate for it but come on, everyone must see by now what a hypocrit he is.
So, F1 is NASCAR 2.0?
stewards:  5 grid places penalty in the next race for Bottas Bottas: nice, even more cars to crash into
Love how before the race Bottas said he was gonna brake late into turn 1
Sabotage
If hamilton passed Alonso 2 laps before he would win the race. He had better pace than ocon and vettel
When champions comes with cheap tricks they look despair
GP 2 engine GP 2 Argh
Bottas:**Is that Norris**...  Also Bottas:**Takes out the Redbulls**       But that maybe race of the decade so far...
Seems Bottas is the new smash king.
When Ocon wins it´s all luck... When Gasly wins he´s incredible driver...
Bottas.....I came for the bumper cars
Schumacher: defends Verstappen: crashes into him FIA: I'm gonna ignore that
Will Fernando be penalized for dangerous driving holding Hamilton up ?.
Imagine Russel ran out of a fuel just 100m before
RENAULT be back !!
Is it just me or does one co-commentator sound like Nico Rosberg?
Atleast max got 1 point😂
How weak is the vettel that he could not pass a driver much less titrated than him, and with a much weaker car.
Alonso getting a bit spicy. But no harm, no foul.
Latifi deserves Mercedes seat for next year.
The Mercedes drivers should drive autoscouter. Wrong sport guys. The FIA is just looking👿
Anyone else see Hamilton on the verge of passing out on stage?!
Bottas doing his job.
Lance Stroll is a Joke!!
It is clear that Hamilton <<<< Alonso Hamilton with a 2'5 sc faster car wasnt able to pass Alonso for 10 laps what a lucky and bad pilot he is
The Alonso-Hamilton duel over 10 laps was like 2009 all over again. By far the best performance by Alonso this season.
You gotta feel sad for Leclerc and Perez
Wenn das nicht Absicht war ? Man opfert Bottas als Bauernopfer um Hamilton sicher nach vorne zu bringen . Und was passiert Mercedes dafür ? Nichts wieder nichts . Wo is das noch fair ? Pfuiiii Mercedes pfuiiii Toto pfuiiii Hamilton
Hamilton doesn't deserve to get out of this situation unharmed. (Im talking about the Bottas crash at the start)
Best race of the season
Two weeks in a row Max has his race ended by a Mercedes.
FIA should given gold medal to Bottas as he perfectly following Toto's instructions. The poor Ferrari can't stop hybrid Hamil,while old Alonso can!!
Well played mercedes ...*slow clap*
They play with fia rules with mastery and they are still safe... Hhhhhhhh... Can't believe that no one see the mercedes and hamilton game on fia... 😳🤣
Merc crashing back into the competition, literally
Been watching F1 for years but Alonso vs Hamilton @Hungary and Verstappen vs Hamilton @Britain (pre crash) are the best battles I think I've ever seen...
FIA must mandate Mercedes to pay all damages dealt to Redbull and Mclaren. As a penalty, cost must deduced from budget of Mercedes and must count in cost caps.
Mercedes: “Plan T(orpedo).” Bottas: “Copy that.” Hamilton: “Bono my rivals are gone.”
Bring the girls back!
Two races in a row where it was the championship rival Mercedes that ruined a total of 3 combined Red Bull race efforts.  Just saying. Process that info how you want.
Alonso defending masterclass
Bottas F2 driver
Bottas taking his teammate role more seriously these days.
Surely now Bottas gets the seat!!
Mercs are a pos team.
Shamilton yet again being a massive crybaby complaining about Alonso's perfect defending, what an embarrassing "driver"
Mercedes are such losers
It was far too impossible challenge to make the highlights of the 2021 Formula 1 Hungarian Grand Prix in just 7 minutes with all the events and drama included.  It was mind-boggling.  Greetings from Hungary! 🇭🇺
Max can't catch a break :(
Seriously nobody can say that hamiltons championchip lead is deserved at this point
Ocon was super lucky at the start while Alonso was boxed in behind Stroll, Leclerc and Norris.
Toto: “Bottas, its hammer time!” Bottas: “Got it”
its serious.. And its a shame.   Bottas did it on porpose.. Every commentator i watched say that mistake can't be done by someone like bottas knowing that track condition on rain. My opinion is that mercedes after redbull performance on last races decide to do all what possible to grant a record championships to his baby.. And another one for them as a bonus. And its obvious that hamilton extra large ego and how he complaint everytime when he is on difficulty, like this Hungarian race alonso moment. Hamilton is just someone who cant be fairplay when he feel danger, that's a truth.
Alpines team effort was unreal
Such a wacky and fun race today.
I am wondering if Toto sent the diagrams to Michael via email again...
*Deep fact: 🏁 Bottas helped Hamilton+Mercedes to get the 3rd podium today to pass Verstappen+Red bull today 🤓  *Fun fact: Bottas - Driver of the day 😂
Mercedes Master 🅱️lan
This is the first race I have watched completely. So worth it 🥳
Mercedes standing first in both constructors and de-constructors championship now🙃🙂
Mercedes has no SHAME, they no longer care about others safety!
funny schumacher and verstappen racing f1 like but now verstappen is better
What F1s drive to attract new and younger fans to F1 has done is bring loads of people who clearly have very little understanding of F1 or it’s history. Hating and abusing drivers, acting as if drivers crash into others intentionally.  These things happen, Perez was driving his teammate into a wall in Spa not long ago, Max was driving into his team mate and had a whole rule clarification as a result of his behaviour.  It’s racing these things happen, especially in those conditions, cold tyres and brakes etc.. besides why is Stroll getting a free pass for an arguably worse mistake.  Enjoy the ups and downs of racing and comment with a level head. There is so much unnecessary hate recently
As happy as I am for ocon, I spent most of this race hoping seb would get past.  Still a fun race, more fun youtube comments
They should have an all star race where they race in the V-10's
Pit crew to Ocon/Vettel : Hamilton changed to medium and closing almost 4 seconds/lap, he will be in your tail with 10 laps to go. Alonso : Not by the hair of my chiny chin chin. Hamilton: He is giving me a hard time !!! Ocon: Whatever people said about Alonso, it's all WRONG !
A day for the team-mates. - Alonso's epic defence helping Ocon win. - Bottas earning a new Mercedes contract
Very suspect, Mercedes.. very suspect on turn 1.....
This would have been such a beautifull race, such a shame this happened.
What a clown fiesta. Too bad for RBR.
Toto: "We're one DNF away." Bottas: "I got you boss."
Toto to Bottas after the race: Next time make BOTH Red Bulls DNF, especially Verstappen.
Bottas is the best wingman ever for Lewis
Alonso vs. Hamilton for me was the best on-track-fight since Leclerc vs. Verstappen in Silverstone 2019. Amazing stuff.
Really quite like this commentator, is it Ted Kravitz? Enjoy listening to him.
Looks like Bottas could be moving to a new contract next year with SWORD International as a long range artillery shell.
How to win a championship: keep punting your rivals off the track…
Poor George Russell… when he finally gets points at Williams, he’s behind Latifi
Bottas hitting all the cars so that Mercedes can win championship...what a plan
I am sick of Hamilton and Mercedes
We need to thank both Alonso and Latifi for this result. Latifi in the beginning for holding up the pack to give the front two a 16 second lead and Alonso for stopping the charge from Lewis
Really disappointing results, F1 is going to lose so many fans/respect after silverstone the Stuawrt’s must not be afraid of Hamilton and the racist problem however such a weak penalty and fear from the stewards has now resulted in a championship leader change this is a major issue for f1 and I believe a lot of fans are tired of the Stewards giving exceptions to Hamilton. It’s a real shame how f1 has fallen.
As Mercedes said: Teamwork will be import.  Bottas proved that
So...is nobody going to talk about Hamilton cutting his gap to Vettel by 8 seconds in 2 laps?
What. A. Race.
well done Mercedes, one more strike and you'll make it triple next time, mega job...  I've never meant to write this, my hands just ACCIDENTALLY wrote this... =_=
Alonso is very underrated rookie
Such a garbage
Hamilton..... such a beast.  You could tell it took every ounce of his mental and physical energy to make the podium this race.  Hamilton could barely stand up straight on the podium.  He'll get some well deserved rest.
Hamilton is just awesome
What was with Hamilton on the Podium??
Imagine telling someone a week ago that George Russel would beat Max Verstappen in the Hungarian Grand Prix without Max getting a DNF
Plz do all reaction like silverston hamilton vs verstappen
It only took 6 drivers being knocked out for Russell to get a point. What a driver!
Glad to see Williams finally scores some points this year
that was one  of the most thrilling races i have seen in ages. well done Ocon and especially Alonso, inspired defending, reminded me of senna-mansell at monaco. surprised at hamilton comeback but was epic drive(by a few drivers for sure)was shocked at how much it took out of him. more racing like this please.
toto:''bottas execute plan deadbull'' bottas: ''accepted''  bottas opens up bottas bowling. Crashes into lando norris and and somehow takes out 2 redbulls 🤣🤣
Seeing Hamilton and Alonso that close together gave me flashbacks to USA 2007
Oh I can't believe how much of this comment section is filled with Super crybaby Maxs' fans. Bunch of sore losers. Hamilton in podium places is always welcomed. But would have loved to see vettel take the 1st place. Glad for Ocon as well. Guy got his first win in f1.
Mercedes to Bottas "It's hammertime" "Copy"
Well mercedes finally found a way to beat red bull consistently. Just ram them of the course in the beginning of the race. Penalties for those are kind of a joke, so it doesn't really hurt them in anyway.
Yeah come on. Bottas is not a rookie. Not his first race in wet conditions. Suspicious af.
My tree favorite drivers(Lando, Charles ando Checo) DNF :(
5 place grid penalty is an absolute JOKE
Lewis: I crashed one car last race Bottas: Rookie numbers mate, rookie numbers
Alonzo did don't historic blocking wow!  Payback from 12 years ago. He was willing to crash his car at 180mph to protect ocon wow! Godlike yea ya ya :D
Bottas testing new damage model in F1 2021.
Toto: Valtteri, what can you do for a seat at '22? Bottas:
Well, well it feels like Singapore 2008 🤫🤭
Hamilton starting on his own was hilarious to see
Bottas, now that's what you call being Hamilton's hitman... Oooooops, I ment wingman.
It's lights out and away don't we go here in Hungary
Was this the first time Lando didnt score?
Everyone pits Lewis: imma do something called not a pro gamer move
lap 3  Everybody ; Lewis we can't race you ,  Lewis- Ok guys dont cry - you get one pit stop head start
Imagine being a Mercedes fan. Yikes.
Hamilton best best the best
After crash Bottas why turn left to affect to the others drivers??? Obviosly....
How bad Alfa is if Kimi always below 10th place. He needs a better car.
Vettel was sooooo close before his first f1 win after a very long time.. but anyway p2 is such a great result. Awesome race with some pretty nice battles😍
mercedes once again doing evrything to not let verstappen win so they crash into him
Max is really not an aggressive driver 🤪🤪🤪
When will the luck of Hamilton end?
Disgusting of ocon to celebrate when red bull have a car that’s DNF’d, cant wait to see albon recreate them lines in turn 1
The difference between Red Bull and Mercedes is that Mercedes makes their own mistakes... but when it comes to Red Bull, Mercedes is there to make mistakes for them as well. At least now we know how the stewards value points. ~50 pts to Red Bull stolen = 10s penalty and 5 grid penalty.
badluck for verstappen
Come on, there has to be some massive fines for Mercedes now. They are clearly just taking out their championship competition.
Where are all the MaxVer ball jugglers?!? 🤣🤣🤣
I am so so so tired of hearing this guy screaming like a maniac. Every time I unmute to hear he’s still yelling like he’s hanging from his b***s. Not necessary, the action is on the track, we live plenty of emotions just seeing it. He should learn from Murray Walker, there must be somebody better than Crofty.
Remember when Grosjean got a one race ban for a similar incident? But just a 5 place grid penalty along with the 10 second penalty is all that happen when you cause the championship leader 2 DNF's.
all is a shame of mercedes shame shame
Coincidence cannot happen all the time.
Mercedes going into race with blind  going on inters for a dry track which cause Lewis first position this time they have no one blame
6:27 "TREJ BONN TREJ B-N!" cmon man 😭😂
Merc unleashing the bottering ram and Lance strolling through the park and into Leclerc really spiced up the race!
*tinfoil hat on  What if Hamilton starting on intermediates was planned to avoid the public backlash that would happen if he lead the race from start to finish after what happened with Bottas, and reduce the possibilities of a harsher penalty for the crash; knowing that Hamilton might not win but surely would score enough points to take the lead in the championship. Otherwise it is really weird for Mercedes not to have foreseen the weather change when everyone else did.
Crowd: Booooooo Lewis: What a great crowd
If Hamilton had pitted with the rest of the field, he could've won this race. But he was still able to finish third AND reclaim the points lead.
Wow guess we just resorted to crashing the other team now
Nico seems to be supporting HAM, never stopped talking about his chances...come on Nico there are other racers.
Hamilton at the restart: Looks like no one is interested in racing today. Never mind, I'll race myself :D
sainz biggest disappointment of the day. this is why he's a no2 driver no defense when alonso in slower car held hamilton off for ages.
Mercedes is trash. Yeah thats how you can win a championship. Take out your rivals. Pathetic
Hamilton being the only car on the grid at the standing start will go down as one of the most bizarre sights for a while
Mercedes powered cars really took a lot of points from rb today.
Alonso’s drive had me smiling from ear to ear.  #33 title shot has gone, faaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrk!
Isn't Raikkonen punished for ramming Mazepin in pit lane??? Hu?
Boyz 2men
Alonso: Bottas watch and learn   Bottas: I am I’m holding your beer
BOTTAS MASTERCLASS!!!
Interesting strategy from bottas to secure a mercedes seat next year
Alonso > Hamilton
Alonso absolutely deserves driver of the day. Stopped Lewis from getting 1st and ensured a win for Alpine.
Alonzo controlled this race. What a driver.
bottas is the draymon green of the game
Do Bottas have a driving license? He drives like in an autoscooter...
Hamilton is the luckiest driver ever
Hi Ramu
Not one break pedal was pushed that corner
Love to see it, how did Lewis get caught like that
Does the FIA not know how enforce laws to make great, clean races!?
Bottas will be getting a nice bonus for taking out Red Bull 😂
Alonso’s contribution is a true team player move! Gave the team the chance to win while ocon had the pace and executed! Awesome day to be an alpine/Renault fan!
I told ya, Valtteri was not gonna let anyone get near Lewis.......well done Ocon....enjoy it dude.
Wallonso
The Mercedes Master Plan is in action bois
Merc strategy for 2021: ramming, hammering, bowling. Change my mind.
Toto: execute order 66 x 2  Bottas: it’ll be done my lord
..Max bangs again, you don't have to be a race car driver or know everything there doing to see that, hahaha...your up against other forces here gentlemen and its not the force of your freaking cars, hahaha
Bottas did the team work again lol
ALONSO N1💪
Rosberg's commentary during the race was amazing.
Commentary is just to loud the guy always shouts
Did Merc sent Hamilton on a PR tour to the back of the field? Championship lead, checked. Fan outrage, halved.
Mercedes Bends Red Bull Wings.
Will Porsche or Bmw join the F1 band and take down Mercedes already?
Achievement unlocked!  Hit both red bulls in the same corner
You think Mercedes know it’s not bumper car racing?
James: Valterri execute order 66.
Alonso is still the best driver in F1 since 2005.
Mercedes vergognosa, pur di far vincere la m&rda n&ra, fanno buttare fuori Verstappen dallo zerbino Bottas
Chaos race
Congratulations Ocon
Bottas: I dont wanna lose my job next year.   Toto: You have to prove your worth.   Bottas: Easy
what a race
The part from 4:16 to 4:36 shows just how much awareness Alonso has in a close fight.  First you see Ricciardo against Verstappen. Ricciardo defends on the inside. Verstappen takes a wider line into the corner, so that he can cross over to the inside on corner exit, carry more momentum out of the corner and attack on the next straight.   Then you see Alonso against Hamilton. The situation starts the exact same way, with Alonso on the inside. Hamilton takes a wider line, wants to carry more momentum, and against most other drivers this might have worked. But then Alonso lifts off the throttle in the middle of the corner! He slows down just enough so that Hamilton has to lift as well to avoid an accident. Hamilton's momentum is gone and Alonso accelerates away from him.  The spatial awareness from Alonso is incredible. If Hamilton were a little bit further back, this trick would not work, since HAM could just go around ALO. And if he were too close this would provoke an accident. But there is this tiny window where this trick works, and Alonso knows exactly when that is the case.  This is how he won that San Marino GP against Schumacher all these years back, and he has lost nothing of his racecraft since then.
Mercedes are a bunch of cheats. They punt everyone of the track and get a slap on the wrist.
Poor RB
These days I am keeping my eyes on every Mercedes on the road.....no drivers license needed.....
This had to be one of the most intense races since last year’s shenanigans! I mean come on: LOOK AT THE ENDING STANDINGS
Bottas did everything he could to give Hamilton the win (accidentally or on purpose who knows) Alonso did everything he could to prevent it 👑
Bottas being the perfect teammate this weekend..... The only scenario where Mercedes could score more points in total then Red Bull.
Do you guys enjoy the our home grand prix? xd
I dont think ocon knew just how much alonso helped him at the end. Insane racing tbf. And as a lewis fan its always fun to see him scythe through the field. Although a clear win was thrown away in amazing fashion, this race was made more tense and interesting
Max trying to deliberately crash into another driver again ... tut tut.
I became an Alpine fan.
Looks like verstappen still hasn't learned anything.... risking his race again by being overly aggressive.  Imagine being knocked out of a race because you're trying to bully a Haas.
Can’t wait for Netflix.
hamilton makes others crash
Mercedes i love BMW
Bottas - destroys Redbull Toto- thats a great wingman right there
Relax kids.
Williams!!!
Is Hamilton ok ? He looks flat out on podium :/
So basically Mercedes can't run a clean race... got it.
Also disgusting behaviour from the Hungarian crowd when Hamilton took to the podium. Says a lot about them
lol Russel what a chancer
ALONSO is the best
Am I sad that RB lost the lead? YES But I’m a elated to see that OCON WONNNNNNNN!!!!! HOLY COW!!!!
I think Bottas deliberately hit because Lando just overtook him and he doesn't want to more gaps(point) to Lando and Perez. By the way Fernando and Sebastian drove perfect. They prove again and again they are the best pilots just they haven't got fast cars.
Brava Alpine, Brava Renault!
boks mercedes red bull.
Valtteri it's James, Mercedes needs a sacrifice
Bottas still being a yoke in wet conditions
So many things happened wow. In a normal race Russel overtaking in pitlane or Mazepin Kimi crash in pitlane would have been the number one discussion topic but now there is not enough time to even mention them!
Nico perfect commentary ,,Bottas took out both Red Bulls ,Lewis never been as big like the great ones..
Spectacular race. Full of suspense I love it
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Great great win for Ocon
petition to keep Nico Rosberg as a commentator
Nobody is talking about the fast Red Bull pit stop
Louis Hamilton has the fourth lowest amount of crashes in F1. He has had 14 crashes in 266 races. 5.3%.  Valtteri Bottas is lowest with 3 crashes in only 156 races. 1.9%. Max Verstappen has had 10 crashes in only 119 races. 8.4%.
This presenter has more energy than the engines. Phew
The worst announcer in all of sports. Turn the volume off. You will enjoy the race that much more.
Hamilton is a phoenix. Even when his car is not the quickest, even when he or his team make a couple of high-profile mistakes or when his main rival seems to have taken the upper hand, he always somehow find a way to get away with it and come successfully through the most adverse situations. The fact that halfway through the season he leads the drivers' championship is a miracle on its kind given the scenario of first 11 races and even if there's still a long way to go you sense that except Verstappen becoming less spirited in certain situations, Hamilton will clinch another world title.
Bottas has finally figured out how to keep his seat at Mercedes. Freaking brilliant 👏🏻
Yes Lewis! Amazing comeback drive🔥. Great drive Ocon and great defence Alonso🤯
Oooh what an interesting race.. Sad about Russell...👍🇬🇧
I am a die hard Alonso fan and today was just EPIC.  Seeing Fernando hold off the Mercedes for long while just made fill up with pride.   What a driver!!   By far the best ever!!!   I hope 2022 comes and Alpine give him a sword to fight with. Then it'll really be game on!!!!
Hamilton looks  like he was going to collapse on the podium, hope he ok I’m just finishing watching the highlights on channel4
Borras really did that on purpose
Don't let this distract you from the fact that Russel finally scored in the Williams! ...and got outscored by Latifi.
Alonso:ALL THE TIME YOU HAVE TO CLOSE THE DOOR
Hamilton: what a goal? Mercedes: you can win this race. Alonso: I'm a joke for you?
mercedes strategy after great britain GP: if it aint broke dont fix it
now its just a matter of time for Bottas to be confirmed at Mercedes for 2022, since he gave Mercedes and Crymilton a huge help...
Epic race
The best race by far this year!!!! Enjoy the break
I am really happy for Russell and Latifi.
No one gone talk how russel finally got some points
we need a video about the hamilton and alonso fight with radio pleaseeeeeee
Toto:  We’re just one DNF away…but it’s safer to make it two.
Can we have someone else commenting other than this always hyper excited and shouting bloke, please?
Vettel and Alonso really showing the world their championship experience
Looks like an open lobby
500s penalty for Lewis and Fernando, very unsafe moves
hamilton alone at start: -did bottas push everyone out?
Que casualidad que en diversos choques el beneficiado es Hammilton
So now it's official: Verstappen just doesn't care that there's another car next to him when positioning himself for a corner.  He bumps into Schumacher like he did with Hamilton in Silverstone. Could've ended his race, but he doesn't seem to care
Alonso King 👑👑👑💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Alonso really said: "The last time we fought against a seven time world champion, we won." Well, he nearly did.
So is this the way the mercs are going to win the 2021 championship?
Okay guys, calm down, bowling was yesterday.
* Giovinazzi gets 10 seconds stop and go penalty for going too fast on the pit lane* * Hamilton gets the same penalty with a serious incident* Ok maFIA.
Bottas, keep driving like this, you doing great job !!!!  Email from Toto
I don't see why only 5place grid penalty for bottas it should be 10 places for next 2 races. The FIA r totally dumb head taking out two red bulls and lando only 5 places. Clearly the FIA BACKS MERCEDES
Vettel 🇩🇪☝️
Bottas is the best wingman you can ask for
That is the Alonso I have missed for 7 years
Alonso is the Alpine 2nd driver
Bottas: My job here is done.
Can't wait for the summer stop to be over. And see another Merc taking out red bulls in the first lap.
Sadly Aston Martin made the second stop in 3.3 which allowed Ocon to get ahead, it would have been a Vettel victory if it weren't for that
Sounds to me like "If cou cant beat them , crash them"
These highlights make it look like there was actually a race between Hamilton and Verstappen…
toto: bottas and i had a really difficult talk next day bottas took out everyone in the race
The great Mercedes masterplan
Grande Alonso!! Gg Ocón and Alpine!
So Bottas had and accident and Hamilton couldn´t hold 1rst place?   Yeah right!
Mercedes takes ? You try to say robbes redbull.
Lewis: last race I took out 1 rival bottas: hold my seat.
Bottas mission complete
What a 🏁🏎
1:19  Lewis: Come out now guys, Valtteri is out, it's safe out here, see?
100% of the comments: Bottas Bowling  Me, being original: F for Lando (Cries in Mclaren)
Botas team orders"take out redbull 🤣
Alonso held up Hamilton for over 14 minutes of a 2 hour max length grand prix in an inferior car on older tires. Let that sink in. Alonso facilitated that win for Ocon. Vettel drove great as well. An amazing race unfolded from the utter garbage that was turn 1 lap one.
Is no one gonna mention Russell finally got points
1:20 Is this the only time when only 1 driver is on the actual grid while the rest are in the pits?
Gio gets a worse penalty than Lewis or Valterri   maFIA: just like the simulations
4:26 Simply magic Alonso!!!
Uhhhhh 5:48 Hamilton drs???
Mercedes fosho be sandbagging
"AND HERE HE COMES SEBASTIAN VETTEL"
All the Max's clowns 🤡 right now 😂
what a race <3
Why is it okay for Hamilton to run Sainz wide, but anyone else does that and they're issued warnings....
James: "Valterri it's James, we need you to take out Verstappen but don't make it look obvious."  Bottas: "Copy James."
I feel so bad for Max. Dudes driving his heart out, maybe even better than Lewis but those accidents are effing him up. First with Lewis and now with bottas. Both Merc drivers. I know I know, racing accidents but it always feels abit sus :D
What a drive from Lewis happy for him. Alonso did amazingly well for Ocon gave him enough time to get that P1 great teamwork. Sad for Bottas. Anyways happy gor Mercs back on top in both constructor and driver points, happy days lads :)
At least hamilton didnt win at that grand prix
Now esteban win and bottas amazing teamwork makes it more difficult for George to get merc seat
Thank you, Valteri Bottas.
Verstappen: I'm coming through.  Schumaker: Nope.
THIS is the commentary I wanted to hear. Where was this?
Ok so no ones going to talk about George’s points?
Mercedes have started argy bargy . Hammer and anvil, order 66, they should install a cattle bar at the front , so we know they playing bumper carts and not racing.
BOTTAS MERC 2022 CONFIRMED
ALPINE RENAULT 🔥⚡💥💪👏👏👏👏👏👏💙🤍❤️💪
Well done Ocon!
Why nobody is talking about the Gasly P6 and fastest lap after that start ? xD
Mazepin is definitely out of his element..scrub
Lewis needed two more laps he could overtake both to win the race 😂
*Everyone pits to change tyres"  Mercedes after 5,000 years:  Yeah, it's dry
ALPINE BABYYYYYYYYYYYY
Valteri Bottas driver of the day
Looking forward to a race where there's less ignorant booing fans
Mercedes team radio: You know what to do with the Redbulls Bottas. Bottas: got it!  Restart.  Mercedes team radio: You know what to do with the rest of the cars Lewis.  Lewis: Got it! Other team radios: Plan B, box and let Lewis start on his own for safety.
Looks like this race was insane. And so unfortunately that i didn't see it online
The craziest start to any race I've seen in my 11 years watching F1.
Totalmente se ve la Mala intención de BOTTAS 👎, dejar Sin puntos a Red Bull
This deserves a extended highlights
How to make F1 interesting?  Just take Mercedes and Red Bull out of it.
Drive to Survive is going to have a field day with this
Massive respect to Hamilton he came down from 14th to 3rd on Podium. He drove his car like a champion and his battle with Alonso was amazing. Hats off to Hungarian GP !!!!!
Mercedes: Ok Bottas, Hamilton took out Verstappen last week so we need you to take out the Red Bull this week or it will look suspicious. Bottas: Which Red Bull do I take out? Mercedes: We Just Need to..... Bottas: I'm just kidding I will take out EVERYBODY =]
Nico's humor and observations were fantastic today.  Hope he becomes more than a guest announcer.  He would make a great booth analyst.
Well that was fun
why has lance got no penalty ?
It's odd that Bottas didn't even try to move aside behind Lando when it was possible. Almost looks like he did on purpose. Who knows...
Vettel another Podium :) Pretty impressive.
Everybody talking about Alonso's great defence, but no one remembered Mick's fight against other drivers
So he hits both red bull & destroyed 7 cars chances in total...and gets a 5 place grid penalty...make it make sense
Mercedes is becoming even more disgusting than ever.
I think we should re-consider reverse grid races!!
Fantastic race, big congrats to Ocon, Vettel, Hamilton.  Alonso was awesome also, Williams getting points was great to see also
Look at Fernando WALLonso
Hamilton crying on the radio over Alonso: PRICELESS
Hmm should i come back to watch f1
In other news, Christian Horner has just submitted a complaint to the FIA stating that this was an obvious attempt to sabotage the race and Hamilton should never be allowed to race again
Okay so Perez is out Bottas is out Max came 10th and Lewis went from 14th to 3rd nice try Alonso but as expected Lewis got a podium finish top 3 is fine we will take those points💪🏽👏🏽😁  Come on Lewis!!!!they can’t blame you today🤣🤣 🏁#8🏆_________________🏎💨
How to rig the WC by FIA. If you are behind in the championship and you drive a Mercedes,  just torpedo your opponents out of the race, it won't have any real consequences.
Bottas 5 place grid penalty. Hamilton 10 seconds penalty. FIA is beginning to look like a joke, is there nobody to take charge and do something about this cause they are killing this sport. Aaaaaargh
And here come the memes...
Drivers protest in favor of ABCDE+ against Hungary but they have no qualms with Qatar or Azerbaijan? Keep your politics to yourself and just drive.
I said last video "I bet towards the end of the session Bottas will Torpedo Max". I did not expect to get proven right next race......
Lando did a great job keeping Brottas behind
Bottas and Toto used the "Timo, schieb ihn raus!!" tactics from Audi 😁😂
After the Banzaï GP. Here is the Panzer GP. What's next?  Mercedes cheating.
hamilton did almost 50 qualifying laps without a drink the whole race
Ocon and Vettel owe Bottas and Mercedes big time. Awesome race!!!
Valtteri, execute order 66
MaFIA perdona y protege todas las marranadas de Mercedes Ya BASTA de tantas conceciones a Mercedes.... Que Carrera tan mas FALSA...!!!!
How is this even fair at this point bottas made it clear he was trying to keep his spot on the team what better way then to crash both red bull cars at beginning of race haha what a joke Mercedes cant win without cheating
Hypocrite of the year: Hamilton on Alonso:  “Cmon man, that was dangerous at that speed!” Last race punts somebody into a wall at 200 mph.  🤷‍♂️
That Stroll crash is arguably worse than Bottas crash
Race start: id expect nothing less from an f1 2020 / f1 2021 open lobby Bottas: The mercedes great master plan lewis red flag restart: Where'd all my friends go?  Ocon, Alonso, Alpine: YESSSSSSSS  Everyone: YESSSSSSSS George has finally gotten points! WOOOOO!
Alonso: I will make the Petrov today.
Congratulations bottas for being signed by Mercedes for life 😂
Watching the normal backmarkers give no quarter to anyone was hugely satisfying. Every inch had to be earned today.  Every. Single. Inch.
Yessssss Russell you deserve those points and more. Get in there. I've been waiting all season to see it 👍👏👏👏
Alonso: My defense was a very key part of the Alpine Master 🅱lan
Ocon mereceu ganhar
This time Bottas executed the team strategy perfectly!
Bottas with that Move just got a new contract and a raise from Mercedes... GG!!!
Bottas the pro Wii sport player
Two races in a row. Even Schumacher against Hill was lessdeliberate. Ban 2nd driver of Mercedes remaining season. Ultimate target for Perez for this season, ram Hamilton of. And if overtaken by a lap. Ouh, you are in my blind spot :-)
Not a Lewis supporter but nobody needs that booing when your on the podium. The physical torture that man had to undergo to get past Alonso is hard to comprehend. He drove incredibly well. Gratz to Alpine what fantastic teamwork.
Ricciardo was so terrible! Stuck behind the Williams for 30 laps or so with a much faster car.
Best F1 season in years so far. Nothing is set for the 2nd half.
When was the last time Renault had victory??
Que asco, de equipo Mercedes es un asco de equipo, ensucio la carrera adrede.... Ya basta de darle a Mercedes todas las ventajas posibles.... ASCO MaFia...
Lol Mercedes new strategy just take out the competition
Hamilton fanboys keep saying it's the track that made Hamilton got held up by Alonso for 10 laps. But how come that Alonso was the ONLY man to be able to keep Hamilton behind him with an older tyre Alpine??  Fernando is just better.
F1 and we all need more rain!
Feel sorry for Vestrapen. 2 times his car been hit by another car. In British and now in Hungarian.
Arghhh so frustrated with Bottas and Stroll. Absolute amateur driving from both. Wounded McLaren fan here 😭😭😭
Boooooooooo
Max could make a comeback. RIGHT?
Verstappen should have had a 10 sec penalty for driving into Ralf. He was nowhere near the apex
Thanks to Alonso and Bottas 😜
BOTASS WAS PUSHING ACCIDENT ON PURPOSE TO GET MAX OUT OF THE RACE…??? MERCEDES STRATEGY F1
This is super sad that we are denied real competition between top two teams. All these crashes and amateur-like mistakes makes HAM-VER rivalry unfair and we just want to see them in just fights.
My face when I realized Latifi was ahead of Russel in the standings.
People have the cheek to mention Lewis. Pure ignorance. Look at Alonso today...!!
thank you toto for causing one of the most beautiful battle of the season
Great Alpine team work, drivers, engineers, strategy, just impeccable job, they deserve the win . Massive respect to Lewis for battling back, he was spent after the race, could barely climb to the the podium, what a year for F1, best season in years so far.
Ocon win Williams double points Williams in podium position for the majority of the race Vettel second Amazing racing from Alonso
The F1 fanbass is so embarrasingly biased and salty towards Merc and Lewis.
This is starting to get a bit convenient and coincidental for lewis, max getting hit. Hmm....
This, this is why we watch F1!❤
i guess bottas will be in that seat next year for what he has done for lewis
My friend was like "Bottas made it worse for his situation in Mercedes" and I was like "ARE YOU KIDDING ME BRO, HE IS THEIR MVP!!!"
Funny how verstappen was so upset that Hamilton crashed him two weeeks ago and labeled him unsportsmanlike, then in desperation chops off Schumacher and no one says anything because there was no wreck
It's light out and away we crash
Red Bull: Build a car. Mercedes: Buys FIA.  The team is a disgrace to racing.
well done Estaban. great job lad.
I stayed up all night, fell asleep before coverage started, woke up as Ocon won, and was confused beyond belief. That was a wild race
Mercedes:  “We can’t beat Verstappen/Honda.” Toto:”Guys, just run everybody off track!”
It’s becoming NASCAR
Alonso: holds off Hamilton at the back. Ocon: keeps the lead in the front.  *teamwork.*
after race bottas got driver seat for Mercedes in 2022.
Mercedes new strategy : crashing the red bulls in lap 1
Finally hamilton didnt win
Usually in the spirit of the sport I don't like to put blames on anyone but this time I have to say that FiA is ridiculously protecting Mercedes. I think bottas deserves a much harsher penalty.
This race was history
meme review will be superb!
Lewis is the fighter
Das war kein Zufall.
I hope mazepin gets Perez 2nd driver spot next year. He can take out Hamilton every race😍😍💪
Mazepin 🤔🤪
BEST RACE BEFORE SUMMER BREAK?
Alonso goes: “you owe me one”. Honestly though, great drive from everybody.
Its really annoying. This has nothing to do with a WC battle anymore.
Creo que el equipo Mercedes debe ser SANCIONADO x una temporada, por la forma en que está haciendo las cosas. No se puede perjudicar a las otras escuderias y quedar impugna. Algo tiene que hacer la FIA con este tipo de acciones. Pienso y CREO que si otra escuderia hubiera echo lo que hizo Mercedes hoy no estaría compitiendo en la FORMULA UNO
Lewis on his own at the restart 😂
Yuki “I’M FASTER THAN PIERRE!!”   Meanwhile Pierre gets a pit stop and more ahead of him 😂
You can hear the commentator slapping his leg in frustration.
What a great performance by bottas. He actually seeked haas Gunter's advise and took the championship lead back for the team.  Kudos to him, it takes alot precision to hit only redbulls without hitting Lewis.
The psychotic mimosa summatively battle because balloon seasonally melt since a steady niece. victorious, abrupt title
Y is no-one talking about Williams getting points
Why should there be a penalty for Vettel for wearing a rainbow shirt? F1 behaves as cowardly as UEFA!
That Alpine patrol honor round at the end was dream like. Loved it!
Such losers… again
7 years later, Fernando Alonso LEADS, A FORMULA 1 GRAND PRIX...
Botas just put Lewis’s drive takeout record TO SHAME
Lights out and Hamilton gets away very well indeed!
Great job by Schumacher! :)
Valeri this is James... You have 2 redbulls ahead of you... You know what to do...
Toto: Go Lewis you can win this race! Alonso: Hold my beer!
This really doesn't do Alonso's defence justice. He fended off about 4 or 5 attacks from Hamilton in almost as many laps
Anyone felt Hamilton was crying on the podium from the booing?
I am starting to believe that rolling starts would be a better option.
Why is it ok for a slower car to be allowed to block a much faster car? That was straight junk. Plus Alonso moved under braking numerous times. Rules clearly say you are not allowed to do that. Lewis could have won this race if not for the ridiculous blocking moves of Alonso. We all know he is bitter because Lewis is clearly better than him. Count the rings loser.
Ok, Maza, no on track incidents! None!  Mazaspin: “gotcha, no ON TRACK incidents.
Están destruyendo la F1......la FIA y Mercedes Benz.....vean lo que están provocando en el público
Bottas the bowling ball
Hamilton lost a winning race 😞
Notice how Botas clearly gets far too close to Lando’s rear and then breaks. This seems intentional. I’m done with Mercedes.
What an chaotic start just bumper cars Bottas the faulter of the race he just break to late and scored an strike both Redbulls, Lando, Stroll, Sainz & Riccardo, Hamilton on a run weird restart everybody goes on dry tyres only Lewis start the race on the grid that's history, Alpine, Seb & Sainz in top 5 George & Schumi in points after this start  Dramatic last laps Alonso defense the champion, epic comeback from the Champ, Ocon hold on to win in F1 Alpine first win as an new rebranded team, Seb again 2nd is he the perez of Amr remember 2012 checo 2nd season he got 3 podium on possible tracks Alonso best race on comeback Toto said that Bottas might lose his seat against George, Sainz brilliant from 15 to 4th Mega, Max unlucky crash broke his aerodynamic to finish 10th but is an bad effort crazy! If it rains in Hungary the chaos start, the last race before the summerbreak is the chaotics the title fight goes into summerbreak and from then on to Spa & Zandvoort Max home tracks
Can a formula 1 race get any more ridiculous?
man can mercedes stop doing incidents also alonso is the goat od this race fk that lockup srsly also feelbad for norris he did such an awesome overtake but he got the main object to play around with mercedes plan
What a race
Mercedes new torpedo technology
C vidéo gag se Grand prix, bravo Oconor
Frustrating reading all these childish comments about Mercedes’ conspiracy with FIA and Bottas’ crushing deliberately. Surely, is F1 now followed mostly by hormonal 17 year olds who think the whole world is against them and out to get them ?
Rapido y furioso
Mercedes drivers and team are cowards hiding behind "accidents"  can't win fair and square 🤫 where's the mastery on track they promised?   Envy to see Honda performing clean!
Congrats to Ocon but for me Alonso was the driver of the day just class from him  🙌🏿
Interesting tactics.
lewis 14th at the beginning , 3rd at the end . on a track that is the 2nd hardest to overtake , give lewis credit .
Lewis at The second race start: " I'm just gonna try flexing my skill by starting on the completely wrong tire here..."
That was pretty exciting. Grass to Ocon and Gasly with the fastest lap at the end.
Not better traction, better driver
me: searched for order 66  youtube:
Best race of the season so far 😍
Verstappen can't catch a break with other drivers crashing into him lately. After this accident now we can say for sure that Bottas days at Mercedes are numbered.
Cool that risberg was commentating
"Valtteri, it's James" *F1 Theme intensifies*
I hate mercedes with all my heart man.
Today was a BSass race 😒😒 so much stupidity happened
i feel like mercedes just made a crashgate 2.0 with bottas-
We need 10 minutes about Alonso vs Hamilton
Hamilton: I took one RedBull out last time. Bottas: Hold my beer
Except Hamilton
"Double Bubble"
2:44 has "F*** Off!" written all over it.
Would have loved to see Vettel win and show it to his haters, but today was no stopping for Ocon, who drove perfect and with a comparable car, no passing for Super-Seb!  My respect!
Common Perez! Make a homerum next race.. Both Hamilton and Bottas dnf🥰🥰
“Vallteri, this is Toto.” Please take out all the championship contenders in turn 1”.
Опять ферстапен резкие движения делает. Хорошо от него сегодня отскочить успели. А то опять кто то был бы виноват.
I was a massive hater of Alonso, but now am convinced that this guy has something special. Was a massive hater, but for some reason my heart says- ALONSO HELPED OCON WIN THE GRAND PRIX OF HUNGARORING!!! ALONSO IS a team player too!!!(He has changed a lot)
Everyone is talking about bottas being the support. No. alonso is the true star in this race. Absolute support class when needed for the team. Never did i ever think that that would be the result. This is why i love alonso so much as a driver. He fought like he was defending #1 for himself, but farther back in the grid. Well done boys. You deserve every bit of that win. What a team effort!   It was also fun to see hamilton get held back, by an inferior car, driven by an exceptionally better driver imo. It actually made the race much more interesting for me over others.
A humiliating day for Alonso and Crashappen
Im so gutted for Max and Red Bull. It was going so well and now they get such a punch in the gut. I just want see a close championship fight
Absolutely amazing racing WOW!!!!
Alonso needs a podium ASAP ! So I can remember all my memories back !
Ham really lost skills. With by far the fastest car not even able to overtake Gasly and taking too long with the other drivers.  Seems like he s not use to racing anymore, only driving strategically.  And someone tell him to stop wining, act like champ.
Mercedes to Bottas: EXECUTE ORDER 66
Toto: Valteri we need you to help Lewis. Bottas: say no more.
Gutted to see what happened with Verstappen and Leclerc, but Alonso made my day lol.
that was the most interesting start ever
This is not Race Highlights. This is Hamilton Highlights.
LET'S GO RUSSELL P9!!!
Instead of watching this highlights I am in love with all these hilarious  comments.
Maybe Redbull should try the same strategy as Mercedes...
Best race of the season so far!
Valtteri Bottas did kamikaze
Toto:bowling now Valteri.  Bottas: copy that.
Battery vottas executes order 66, 1956 colorized.
Redbull we will race today.. Mercedes not on my watch
Bottas was driving a JCB today; slow off the line, poor breaks and wrecked everything in its path.
What a restart !!!! Hamilton was under pressure, oh wait...
Hamilton on the radio complaining about Alonso was the cherry on top of Alonso’s brilliant defending.
Driver Of The Day --- Valtteri Bottas.
The guy who bet this Podium places is rich for life 🤑🤑🤑🤑
Alonso done what his team needed at that moment WTG @ Alpine
Williams got double points finish!!!
And people said this race would be boring
Memers: I smell profit ha ha ha ha nice
Media & Toto Wolff: Bottas needs to step it up in the fight with Red Bull Bottas: I'll just take both of them out. Red Bull: *shocked pikachu*
SEB 🧤🧤
Боттас шестерка реальная "задание выполнено"
First time Russell gets into the points his teammate scores twice as many😅
An epic 6 lap battle between Alonso and Hamilton gets reduced to just 4 corners of highlights?
Lewis it's hammer time  Bottas: and I took that personal
Bottas executes order 44. cant beat them? Hammertime 🔨
So Bottas has worked like a pro squire: one move - and excellent help for his lord. Such a shame!
Alonso for driver of the day
Also i want nico every race commentating
BREAKING NEWS! Next year RedBull/Honda is going on collaboration with UralVagonZavod! The new car Is going to be  known as “The Red Honda”! The new car will be able to seal the victory within the first couple of hundred yards! Red Bull probably won’t need Max Verstappen anymore !
Esteban mightve been consistent, but fernando was played a big part in his win. this man really said "i know im getting old and i just turned 40 but i still got some fight left in me"
Bottas did his job today, lol.  Russell finishing behind Latifi was total facepalm.  So much for the buzz about Russ.
Toto: "Maybe Russell for next year?"  Bottas: "It's Hammertime!"
Ale się zadziało na początku wyścigu
INCROYABLE cette course !
Mercedes pigs
Alonso great drive i hope the other drivers see how u driver in the f1
Super exciting race nothing beats f1 …road racing is king there is so much more strategy
Watching the race start live with the B team commentators was night and day compared to this with Crofty
I wonder if Ocon walked up to the CEO and whispered quietly in his ear...        "Biznatch"
Alonso really played the team player there holding up Lewis so he couldn’t catch Ocon.
So i missed a shitshow
Hamilton the only one on the grid...Still swerves to defend position
Hamilton backing out of a turn? Well this is new *sips tea*
Fernando Alonso, 40 years old proves once again that he is one of the best drivers of this century.
Best team player of the race: Bottas or Alonso?
mazepin do what he best at.
Bottas, if you want to keep your seat from Russell, take out both RB’s and  Lando at the start please. I have a diagram, I will email it to you. Toto
goodjob Lewis👍👍
Verstappen has so bad luck
"This is bowling. There are rules". The big Lebottas
no cause the meme reviews for this race just might as well be the ENTIRE race itself---
GEORGE FINALLY GOT HIS POINTS LET'S GOOOOOO
Merc crashing cars as usual I see
Bottas racing like I do in my F1 2020 team to win the constructors
bottas was busy crashing cars on the circuit while mazespin on the pitlane
Blin on botass
There should be some extra points for the best wingman of the race!
Alonso's defense for Ocon was brilliant
Bottas: Takes out both Redbulls.  Mercedes: Give that guy a medal 🏅.
Hamilton did great recovery. Brilliant overtaking and the last battle with Alonso was epic. This season is the best ever!!
One of the best races in a long time!
favorite race of the season so far and having Nico Rosberg as the guest commentator made it even better
Idk what just happened but it happened 😂
Much Respect Fernando Alonso. 🙏
F1 was getting a bit stale for me. But Verstappen and Hamilton’s competitive rivalry has lit a fire into the narrative.   And this was one of the most exciting races I’ve seen in a while.
Is this the first time F1 driver win by start from pit lane?
Need more to say, " everybody to pit the title is given", shame  Lewis never will be a  Professor that's for  sure. Nothing new F1 is politics these days  out
It is a miracle that he didnt spin in that car and still managed to finish the race
Hamilton and Mercedes 🤡🤡🤡
Ocon wow congratulations
DRIVE TO SURVIVE, BET
Wait, can y'all hear crofty and rosberg in the beginning?
bottas desperate
Just like at Imola, Mercedes had Bottas crash his car to give Hamilton an advantage. I'll take that to my grave.
No poneis toda la pelea con alonso joder que asco
Demonic actions again by Mercedes
Botaas Rusher
Best racing of the season so far imo
🤯🤯🤯👍👍👍👍👍👍
Alonso vatan savunması yaptı resmen
Alonso saved the race with his defending. What a brilliant driver when he's happy. I hope next years Alpine helps him fight for wins to see more of this fun racing.
Does Mazepin do this everytime?
1:20 Hamilton competing with his rivals in 2019
Happy for Estoban
Nobody: Mercedez: BOTTAS BOWLING!
5 grid penalty is not enough for the damage Bottas has caused
Russel got points! And so did latifi!!
Spa '98 2.0?🤔
Stroll: Bottas took out drivers like an idiot! Engineer: Copy that Stroll: *Copies that*
Fernando is faster then you
W Wiliamsie to płakali na te 6 pkt ? że w końcu zdobyli !
I think that Merc told bottas to crash into the two red bulls
Man I wanted Cyril on the podium so bad
Merc:”its hammer time” Valtteri:”aight”
The crash at start man.
After Qyaliflying yesterday Hamilton : Such a great teammate Vallteri....   Bottas though Sundays race give both RedBulls their wings🤡
Hamilton: I can take out one Red Bull! Bottas: amateur
It’s a pity the commentator couldn’t get a bit more excited. Lol 😆
Interesting tactics by Mercedes ;)
Incredible race
Valtteri Maldonado
No one is talking about both Williams have scored points
Mercedes is the dirtiest team in history, they can't win on the track, so they crash on opponents to win the championship. Disgusting.
0:25 this just breaks my heart.
Who was the better wingman today? Alonso or Bottas?
Can Mercedes just stop taking out redbull. This wasn’t intentional but it’s looks bad that it’s keeps happening.
RB receiving immense gridpenalties (max wil need his 4 engine) cuze of 2 blind MB drivers. It’s for me clear: MB stole the WCS already for 2022. And the only dumb …f who will cheer are his idolizing british fans
Daniel Ricciardo probably made the biggest mistake of his career by going to McLaren.
Hey, somebody different won....
Alonso que grande! Que piloto!! El morocho lo estaba llamando por celu a Ron Denys para que diera orden de equipo... Igual que en 2007 llorando!! Fernando Alonso Magnífico!!
Will done Bottas
Botas team play got outshined by Alonso?
If Bottas' seat at Mercedes for next season wasn't already gone, it has now!
Why we couldn't hear the Sky commentators live on F1TV?
The favourite sport for millions of fans is getting ruined by Hamilton, the british and Mercedes. Hamilton is absolutely disgusting.
Why cant just a predator missle hit lewis's car
What a joke 7 x wc ..... Overtaking skills bellow zero. How much overspeed do you need?
Latifi tho
Alonso is pure class 🔥
01:21 Jamas en la historia ocurrio esto!! Never in history has this happened!
F1 would be so much more engaging and  fair and interesting if it wouldn't be for so many reckless, untalented drivers. Look at Bottas, Stroll, Mazepin, Tsunoda. They can not drive. They can not defend. It is simply frustrating to see these drivers ruining others races or simply not being able too keep up or to pull off a defensive  move. Lamenting!
Merc realise that they dont have the change to fight in the contructor so what do they do? Take Out Your Rival ....... Well done merc well done.......
oh man if max had seen what happened to Norris and would have gone wide left the collision of those 2 could have been avoided. Perez would still have been shunted out, but Norris might have been able to save the turn and max just wouldve lost some time going on the outside
Alonso holding Lewis like a tank Ocon defending himself from Vettel without a mistake. What a race by Alpine ❤️.
Thanks from Brazil. 🇧🇷
Bottas the professional hitman, he made a pentacrash. Such a pro
worst race in the history of f1
Did Gasly pit for fastest lap? I think I missed that.
That second race start with Hamilton alone on the grid looks like something straight out of one of those older F1 games (everyone else got disconnected)
If Alpine have better pace this season this duo can do wonders
That shot looks so badass (6:38)
More proof bottas is heading out of the merc seat
Very Suspect; Botas takes Out the Red Bulls! 🤔
Max Verstappen why p10
That 's typical Bottas. Unable to adapt to different circumstances...
I still don't understand why Lewis didn't pit like the rest.
PERFECT starting grid for him)
*Amigos disfruten este año que estamos ante la mejor temporada de F1 desde 2012*
Hammertime i guess?
Shame hamilton !!!
Lewis's dreams come true lol
Toto: execute order 66 Bottas: thy bidding will be done master
Love the way how Alonso drive alongside with Ocon at the end of the race! Wonderful team bonding there.  What a wonderful defence from Alonso as well!
What a WIN for OCON!! Well done..
Bottas steered LEFT after crash! Took Perez w that! Mercs are cheaters! Gloves off time!
Lewis was completely wiped out at the end. He had to work hard for that podium finish.
WHY ARE WE YELLING!!??!!
Another Mercedes Master 🅱️lan
"Valtteri, it's James..."
What a race!
Respect for Hamilton 📉📉📉
Congrats to Ocon, but RUSSEL IS FINALLY IN THE POINTS!   Oh, wait... scratch that. 2 WILLIAMS IN THE POINTS!
The defense of Alonso is the reason why Hamilton is not P1 today, big Lewis fan here, but I enjoyed the racing between two world class drivers, wish all drivers on the grid could race like this
Great race
Bottas, Mercedes taught you well hãn? Great job going against both Red Bulls lol...
Soy team RedBull, pero hay que aceptar que Lewis es increíble, ver cómo batió a los dos españoles, y como lo ha hecho con Max V. Estamos viviendo una gran era en la F1
Aloooonso man, lovely!!  I'm so happy for Ocon!!!
Mercedes are a complete joke. Unsportsmanlike behavior is their trademark now.
Maybe bottas gets to stay with Mercedes now?
If that was Verstappen held off by Alonso, he would have probably crashed :D
Seb ❤
Very well done for DAVIDE BRIVIO!!!!
Norris hella unlucky there could have been a podium
0:11 0:32 No one thinks Lando breaked too much??
This season's drive to survive is going to be interesting
Quelle course d’Alonzo!!!!!!
Not sure why Mercedes and Hamilton were the only team that didn't see what everyone else saw on the track and stayed out instead of pitting.
Can we all agree, Lewis took his grid penalty and still made up 14 points on Max.
Todo lo que hace Bottas para ayudar a Hamilton!!!!!
Bottas fault
Espectacular Alpine!!! Una gran carrera y me encantó la cátedra magistral de Fernando Alonso sobre Lewis Hamilton!!! Un poco más de coche y Fernando no pierde esa posición. Lewis aún tiene mucho que aprender!!!
Drivers: let’s all box but don’t tell Lewis
Here before 1 million views
Excellent racing 🔥
Hamilton is a beast! Great driver!
Can we all just admire Mick's performance holding off Verstappen and others for many laps as a rookie in a Haas.
0:10 Bottas: Lando, It's Valterri, Let's go bowling.
Lewis starting by himself was really funny for some reason
Bottas - Carromboard player in this race. Hit the target Max with Lando. Can only feel for him. With this incident, he sealed the deal for Russell for the second seat at Mercedes.
Where Sergio Maurício ?
Sad for Leclerc
My boy Vettel back on podium!! And what a mega drive by Ocon, this was his well deserved moment especially after all the rough patches he's been through these past months. Too bad Bottas's stupidity costed both McLaren and RedBull their races, Mercedes always there to ruin other's moments.
Lucky Hamilton  once again to survive the crash at lap 1
Mercedes mafia
Max's disrespectful overtake on Schumacher though???? Basically takes him out to go past and because he's a front runner no penalty? What is this bumper cars or racing!
Fernando put on a defensive masterclass this race. So happy for Estaban!
Arise Alphine & Aston Martin
glad for estaban for his deserved win...this is the reason why i hate F1 bc the gap between top and bottom teams are so far apart...and something like this happens bc of weather...today estaban won...last time gasley won...etc...
king Lewis
Mercedes now builds torpedoes too
Williams finally get their points. Absolutely brilliant
5:48 Why is Hamilton´s DRS on !?!?
I can get used to seeing Vettel on the podium every race.
Can we petition for Nico Rosberg to be a commentator for the rest of the year? He was so fun to listen to in this race. Great knowledge and entertaining.
Alonso: Races lewis hard but fair, they barely touch once Hamilton: tHaT's DaNgErOuS dRiViNg
Toto : Guys let's take redbull out on the first lap.  Bottas: yes
Norris' points run comes to an end through no fault of his own.  Latifi outscored George, like Kubica.  George scored!  Latifi showed some real race craft!
1:02 You were almost right, pal.
Latifi 4 points, Russell 2 points, Latifi > Russell
Definitely need extended highlights for this race 🔥🔥🔥
So Mercedes, are you going to sabotage another race next time?
Going kamikaze on the Red Bulls is the most Botas has ever done for the team.
Who’s idea Lewis didn’t pit in?  I never seen one car start alone  Hahaha 😝
mercedes master blan is working
The sabotage of Max's races continues
Totto: Bottas? Bottas: Yes? Totto: Code Red. Execute order 66 Bottas: Aight let's fokin gooo!
Best race of the season. HAMILTON GOT HUMBLED BY ALONSO.
Man, Lewis is a beast. Though I am not fan of his but as a f1 fan. I have to admit this man is one of the best.
Crazy race with Ocon, Vettel and no.44 on podium! (exhausted, sick or was he the only one who knew a colleague was in the hospital...?) Another beautiful and fair race by @Max33Verstappen, with half a car in the points! @mercedesamgf1 also extends lead in F1 bowling. At 1:18 No.44 invited  all his friends to a party on the grid.
Why couldn't Lance just use the full extent of the grass to avoid crashing out with Charles? I can't tell if that was understeer with the front end refusing to dip or him turning left intentionally. Surely can't be the latter.
Brilliant drive from Alonso. Love him or hate him, that man is a class driver and seems to have aged very well as a person and teammate. Grateful for having him on the grid again.  seems like these cars getting quite a sendoff season eh ?
seb and fernando still got it, true champions.   also well done to ocon, and the williams, so happy for them!
Williams had both cars in the points, so happy for them
Well,  I think Bottas Mercedes seat for next year is safe for him now. 😊
F1 is starting to get the football fan affect haha braindead fans
How much more will the FIA let Mercedes cheat. That was just blatant from Bottas what did they tell him to take out all the drivers around Lewis so he can walk to an easy win. If bottas isnt handed a 2 ban for this then this championship is in disrepute
Mercs perfecting their hammering strategy
It was INSANE!
🥳🇨🇵 🇨🇵 🙏 Alonzo
Hamilton Driver of the Day
Maybe this is a glimpse at what we will see next year with the new changes. Everyone was actually racing each other.
Alonso: "You have to leave space everytime" Also Alonso: Not this time
......
It's Pretty weird to hear nico rosberg as commentator
Petition for Nico to be a commentator
Best race in years, for the fans. What racing should look like today. Instead of the formula show we've been enduring of late.
I think vettel would hold ham pretty well if it got to that
Nico Rosberg commentateur avec Sky Sports F1 UK
Alonso stopped Hamilton like a boss. Its because of Alonso's defense against Hamilton that Ocon could win today.
Radio: we see Hamilton as a threat for our win.. Alonso: leave it to me..  Radio: he got better pace.. Alonso: i got better defence..
Mercedes you're a cheat!! This was clearly planned because someone as talented and seasoned as Bottas knows better to not break that late into a rain soaked first corner.  You're a cheat Mercedes.
where was russel suuposed to go ? during the restart
The first 30seconds is every F1 game race when playing the ranked mode online.
Valteri: What's the plan?  Toto*: Execute Order 66.    (* Darth Wolf)
bien joué Esteban Ocon vive la France
Can't wait to hear Bill Burs take on this :D He is not a fan of Hamilton :D
I do believe the technical term is a "fustercluck"
Fernando won Alpine this race. As much as i wanted Hamilton to win, hats off to Esteban and Alpine!
This race just showed how op is the Mercedes... Pure and simple. Ayrton Senna=GOAT.
DOUBLE WILLIE IN THE POINTS
Mercedes should be disqualified for the rest of the season!!! Who cares who wins we want fair races...
This race proves that Alonso deserves to be Rookie of the Year.
Petrov (Abu Dhabi 2010)of the day: Alonso
So unfair when u just have a car which is so much faster than everyone else.
i put up with race after race of the same people dominating and winning over and over and over again just for that one vague chance that someone else might win. fantastic job ocon!
Great great race. Alonso Is well deserved driver of the day. It's a shame that mercedes always takes the best drivers out of the race. Very bad mercedes.
so now what will merc do in the next race? previously hamilton hit him this time bottas created a mess... wow what coincidences
Bottas: "I'm sorry guys" Mercedes: - No apologies needed
Russell has spent the last 2 and a half years trying to get into the points for Williams, and then when he finally does it Latifi finishes ahead of him
That has to be the weirdest race restart I have ever seen
Verstappen: I will win this race Bottas: Allow me to introduce myself
Is Romberg now analist on f1?
me: how many times can a mercedes crash the title rival out of a race? mercedes: yes.
Some questions for mercedes ... 😂
Bottas: I will do anything to stay in Mercedes Also Bottas: I hate orange and i will crash him Toto:  facepalm
THANK YOU ALONSO! THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
What a race, wow I'm so happy for Ocon/Vettel!!!!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😁😁 And great race from Lewis! ❤️ Awesome job Mercedes. Great race boys!
Fun fact: The only team that scored points in every race of this season is ... Alpha Tauri!
It is amazing how racist the fans are
To repeat my comment from last week: If you can't race him, just knock him of the track.... Difference compared to last week; Bottas did this completely unintentionally.
Gutted for Lando and Charles today but plenty of positives as well. Great to see both the Williams back in the points and amazing to see a new winner in F1 as always. And a Seb Vettel podium is never a bad thing too 🙂
The most important part in this race was who leads after the first lap. Ocon got lucky and with the limited overtaking  at the Hungaroring he won. I thing that if one of Vettel,Sainz,Alonso or even Gasly was  in the lead after the restart they could also win the race. But huge congragulations to Esteban
no comment on williams first points? :(
Bottas taking HAMMER TIME literally.
At the restart, if anyone from back of the field followed Hamilton instead of pitting, they wouldn't know where to start 😂
Bottas just saved his Mercedes seat for 2022 😂
Great effort from bottas to the team
Bottas, who recklessly torpedoed half the leader pack at once: 5 position penalty Stroll, who had nowhere to go after Bottas's crash and tried to avoid the collision: 5 position penalty fair enough
0:26  What if the world was in 3D
Bottas must be filling his aplication to clow college right about now.
i still can't get over how funny the commentator is when little things happen
I use to like  Bottas, glad he is out of a seat. Hamilton is still a pos
Is that Nico Rosberg on commentary
i smell a bit karma
That was a great race!
The new Mercedes strategy take out the red bulls
loved hearing Nico
Biggest points for Valteri today!
Rosberg on commentary?! Come on.......
It's getting old the mercs have to cheat to beat red bull.
Idk  but it seemed that bottas hit norris in pure fassion to kick out max.
kamikaze bottas
What’s wrong with Williams cars? I muted the TV when watching and got confused how they dropped from top 3 back to eighth and ninth!
Happy for Ocon, but what a BS race. I don't get everyone calling this chaos a great race.
wow bottas KOs both RB cars. nice strategy
We see the way how Mercedes and Lewis are gonna win the champ
Even if you are a staunch anti-Hamilton fan, you must admit he did a fantastic job correcting a horrible mistake. Moving from P14 to P3 on a difficult track to overtake. The second part of this F1 session will be fantastic since more drivers are coming to the fray. Kudos to Alonso for holding off Lewis but also Kudos to Max for holding out with a damaged car.
Bottas just got new contract with this double punt of RedBull cars. And Lando was just a additional bonus fee he will get.
You know Hamilton is dangerous they try keeping him away at position 5
"The best race of decade" Me, 2021
Pero que maldita suerte tiene Hamilton, en serio que pta suerte del man 🤔
Ocon and Vettel,  thank Alonso for this victory
Lewis: I cant take out my competition 2 races in a row. Mercedes demolition derby team: Bottas, its team orders time.
If Jean Marie Balestre was the president drivers wouldn't dare to cross lines.
Bottas is an oaf
Alonso >
Hamilton is so Lucky
give the announcer a xanax ffs
Fans booing Novak, Lewis, neymar, Serena , shows people are such losers
Valtteri "Team Orders" Bottas
dammm lewis was fast. the others look like driving miss daisy.
Dunno why but only one car ready to start was really funny.
Super proud Mercedes, ❤️💪
Why was Alonso’s car 12 feet wide? Seems unfair.
Latifi ahead of Russell, that was something...
Give Alonso a Redbull or Merc and he will win a championship
Verstappen always banging wheels 🤔🙄 now if he spun full blame on Schumacher 😑😕
0:15 ...and with that misjudged act, Bottas' days in Mercedes are truly numbered.
Mercedes yet again taking out redbull
This shows that  Mercedes can go to any extent to win
What a battle!
Ocon deserves that win so much
Hamilton has clearly shown and prove that he is a true racer. Not like Max and his team management winding like a baby and looking for sympathy throughout this championship!
I think even if Lewis had pitted he would have lost out because he would have to stop let all those cars go before he can leave pit stop
Ocon knows that Alonso won him this race .
Alonso to Sainz : I gave it all to keep you in the podium my fellow Spaniard.
So happy for Vettel!!
Alonso is the GOAT
Couldn't watch the race but ...this highlight gave me goosebumps .....what a race was it for ocon 🎉
What a race that was,happy that Russel finally got points and also gutted that lando got dnf, also say what you want about Lewis Hamilton but I don't think any other driver would've got podium after horrendous team tactics, a track famed for lack of overtaking opportunity and an alonso masterclass, what a legend 👏
So the Mercedes strategy is to take out Verstappen at the beginning of each race.
This goes down as one of the best races in the last few years for me. Insane first corner, the Lewis mishap staying out on inters, all the 1v1 battles including Alonso keeping Lewis behind for so long - and to top it off with a first win for Ocon. LOVED IT!
Unbelievable how Mercedes can just bulldoze their way into the lead and no one even questions it. Absolute classless garbage. Imagine the outrage if it was the other way around.
Lewis luckiest driver ever!
"Lewis Hamilton is going to feel like the last car on track. That's because he is"  Get David Croft out of the commentary box, for the love of the sport. Horrendous
If it wasn’t for Mercedes crashing into him and getting away with it constantly, Verstappen would be leading the title race by a mile. He’s so much better than Hamilton.
I'm just wondering Hamilton and Vettel supporting LGBT community this race in Hungary, where government has been pretty harch on minorities. But we will race in Russia soon, where dictator Putin is threatening LGBT even worse than Hungary, also bombing Syria, occupying Ukraine and killing innocent people. Are any drivers showing any support for victims and oppressed people there? I bet nobody will, cause they are too scared. If I was a driver, I would paint my helmet with Ukraine flag colours in russian GP.
Mission Hungaroring: turn 1 bowling  Nice one Bottas!
First race for Landon without points...
Congrats Ocon, love seeing it. Also, this race is FULL of memes. Dacha44 is going to have a field day
Message to Bottas: want to drive next year? Crash into EVERYONE.
safety car step up for a Mercedes 1 2 restart.
Second time in a row verstappen gets kicked out
Bottas and Scroll Outside of F1
Absolute bonkers
Valtteri, it's James...
Fun fact: Alonso has the highest points scoring streak going right now :D
What a idiotic crowd …booing such a great race … Lewis almost wins after overtaking at one of the most difficult tracks and also ruining Ocons moment
Silverstone sprint and now this? It's amazing how Alonso's hasn't broken his back after carrying the sport like this.
Mercedes fail and win, that's it.
Alonso is the most skilled entertaining driver, this race was crazy
F1 race......or demolition derby!!??........Sheeesh!
Seems pretty obvious to me Mercedes should give the 2nd seat to Latifi. These will be Williams only points this season and Russell will forever be Latifis wing man😅
F1: Alonso turned 40 he's getting older  Alonso: And I took that personally
Yes Bravo Ocon en avance Alpine
Never have I seen so many F1 driver's that cannot drive...!!!
Funny how nobodys going to talk about this 2:45 thats why this fraud only got 1 point 😂
ay i dont mind bottas crashing in every turn 1 because this race was MAD entertaining rather than the usual. Still, the podium hamilton has today is well deserved.
What a mess in the start. Clearly merc is desperate to win this season. So desperate they take other cars out whitout hesitation. F1 has become a very sad sport to watch. I will not watch it anymore. /Micke P
I hope clean race :)
Bottas hulk-smashing his way through the field to take out two RedBulls!! 😂 Mercedes strategy: if you cant beat them...err well..just crash into them. 😂😂
Announcer definitely needs to scream more.
British GP: 1st lap had drama Hungarian GP: Hold my beer!
Bravo esteban et bravo aussi Lewis
*Everyone hyping up Russel*  Latifi : "And i took that personally"
If bottas can repeat this 1-2 times, 2022/23 seat confirmed!!
Quote Alonso: i was fighting to help Ocon and Max
1:18 After the British GP, and after the start of the first lap, safety measures had to be taken so they decided to let the Mercedes start alone, so he could not crash anyone out.
Alonso showing his experience still trumps the cocky young drivers. If Hamilton was half the driver he thinks he is, he should've had no problems. Also glad to see both Williams getting points
What a meme of a race! Great stuff.
Mercedes the criminals of F1
Bad strategy of Mercedes should they pit after restarting the race.
Amazing day for Williams and Alpine
This race looked like F1 2021 game
Mercedes before the race- “Alright guys, you know the drill, let’s draw straws to see who is going to knock Verstappen out of the race this week.”
Crazy race
That restart with hamilton alone fealt a bit like 2005 U.S GP all over again lol.
Looks like Seb will lose his P2. My heart is broken.
Toto about Red Bull  If we can‘t beat them Let‘s DNF them
It's not fair mercedes need a big correction every week it is mercedes break the red bull cars
wow
Should've shown hungararing sprint 500 for vettel and ocon 😂🤦😛
What a race, nothing against the title contenders but I love seeing a team that isn’t red bull or Mercedes win
Seb will lose his podium...
Welldone there Lewis,from 14 to 3rd place.u r a what a  real champion is all about mate.podiums are all yours and u deserve them.congrats man and team.lets do it next race.much love🤘
Mercedes taking the "gloves are off" a bit too far 😛
LOL 🤣😂🤣 has anyone ever had to start a race alone?? Is that another record of some sort?? So Bizarre.
Russel: I'll let my race be compromised to help Latifi out :)  Mercedes: This is the attitude we like, you're hired.
Starting to look like a F1 2021 online race
It's ok then for verstappen to hit someone in a corner ?
So bottas taking one for the team...what an excellent strategy mercedes...lol...i still love you guys
Valtteri, wondering why fans are boooing you guys??? Mercedes has just become the dirties brand out there!
Top 6 in the drivers championship scored 16 points today 😂
I know its open wheel racing, but they need to figure out how to make these cars more durable. Every race you see 2-3 cars go out with extremely minor contact that is completely catastrophic to the car.
Christian: who do we blame....🤷‍♂️🔎👀 Paddock:
So happy to Alonso go toe with lewis here. Thanks for great show champs!!
Most exciting race so far!
Bottas after crash: Sorry I thought we were playing bowling 🥴 Hamilton: So you accepted the challenge 😈
Mercedes Mafia
Lando :(
Should be interesting in the Belgian Grand Prix when Bottas has to undergo a five spot grid penalty.
Valterri its james.... execute order 66
Everyone talking about Bottas, but what about Stroll who ruined the race for Leclerc and Norris?
wow Max hitting another car again .....
Verstappen goes in to the first corner Bottas: imma end my whole career
Lewis alone at the restart...hmm..toto was right..it was bottas's fault that he never came to the pits for tyre change:)
Wow. Restart lights out so fast.
Alonso was doing God's work
Well I did say L.HamiltonF1GP before. 1:22 it actually happened.
Russel taking bottas' place after the restart
Bottas: Porridgest driver ever. He thought it was demolition derby...
Flex seal should sponsor RedBull LOL
Alonso u beauty 😍
Hamilton last race: *knocked out one driver* Bottas it the distance: *STRIKE*
Mercedes, it's Blitzkrieg once again.
Alonso really walked into Hungary and said: *I will show you how not to leave the space.*
Brilliant race, Unending action and a great win for Ocon. Plus, vettel p2 and alonso holding off Hamilton a bit. Sad to see Max not get a lot of points today.
So Merc decided the best way to win is taking out RB. Bottas doing great job. Thanks Alonso how to show clean racing
What a performance from Alonso
One of the most bizarre races I have ever seen!
“Interesting tactics”
Max fans , yesterday” Perez is going to wipe out Lewis tomorrow “ Mercedes hold my beer
That restart with only one car was so weird
Bottas assisting Lewis yet again 🤣
Well if I was up for conspiracy theories..I would say...how come Botha's took out both redbulls🥴🥴🥴..highly suspect this  is
Thank you Bottas for giving us a real race!!!
can we PLEASE get rid of this annoying belting high-pitched commentator?
Every time Bottas says he’s gonna fight for the championship I have to laugh out loud.
please shut that hyperbolic screamer up.
why does the guy scream at the beginning? he can't change anything  so what for.  Hombre! i can see!
1:18 - When you bump into someone on the formation lap on F1 2021
Valterrrriiiii its James "If you can get the two Red Bulls that would be nice"....
Okay, There´s now no doubt as to how Hamilton and Mercedes pretend to win. Taking Red bulls out of the track seem to do the job.
"Yeah it's dry" made my day
Bottas needs a sign will work for food. Cuz dudes going to be out of a job
BOTTAS want to stay with mercedes lol
Great race.
ALPINE CEO feels like an idiot right now doesnt he?
What a drive form Lewis. The true GOAT
Russel finally gets points... Behind Latifi...
Hamilton was so slow before the pit stop he even struggled pass MSC he was complaining the whole time in the radio and after the pet stop he was unstoppable! What happened?
Imagine Hamilton being the only one on the grid for the restart and then jumping the gun :D
Look at the first half of this year. We’ve had six grand prix victories, the races we’ve lost were with a tyre explosion, we were taken out at Silverstone and this race this weekend,” said Horner, omitting any reference to Hamilton’s wins in Bahrain, Portugal and Spain.
Just a question, why is Hamilton's DRS open at 5:47 ? He had noone ahead, when he crossed the drs line, did he?
1:18 USA 2005 vibes...
Woow,Vettel could get top , but Ocon was not gentleman when Vettel could pass him.
Alonso was the one watching over Ocon <3 I believe Hamilton would've put Ocon under even more pressure if it had not been for those blocks from fernando.
Lo de Alonzo fue espectacular !!!!!!!!!
GIVE VALTERRI A RAISE!!!
They compare F1 to INDY but it's been more like NASCAR.
Seb on the podium again yay!
It was an amazing race
Now THAT was a gongshow
Mercedes: Bottas, Hamilton is being watched. Please take the Red Bulls out instead.  Bottas: ok
What a race today 🤯
Mercedes: *Doesn't pit Hamilton* 🅱inotto: "OH NO OUR 🅱LAN WAS REVEALED"
The Alpine team, especially Ocon, should send a thank you gift to Bottas. 😁😎🤣
Congratulations to Ocon A brilliant Fight for Lewis and Alonso Perfect Race me to watch on my Birthday!!
Seeing Vettel and Alonso at high positions made me feel nostalgic for the early 2010s.
What a season we are having
Bottas: The greatest 2nd driver of all time.
Mercedes realizing that the only way to win is to cheat. All the races for the rest of the year will be the same.
I don’t know if Bottas did or did not improve his chances for the Mercedes seat next year xD
At first i tought it was Norris a rokie but turns out Bottas a peace maker for Hamilton.
Best birthday Alonso could've wanted Also, 1:28 is what hamilton sees almost ever race when starting
No one woke up thinking this would happen best race do far by a mile
Hey Valtteri, it's James.  Just don't brake.
Ocon should be polishing Alonso's racing boots, taking out his trash and any other mundane task that he can think of!
From last to podium, it takes pure skills! give Jack his jacket!
Fun fact: LATIFI has more point of RUSSELL now 😂. MERCEDES SIGN NICOLAS
race of the decade
what a great race for alpine loved it  alonso what a drive
100% sure that accident was order by Mercedes and Wolf under the table  A second crash gate???
Bottas just secured his seat at Mercedes for 2022.
WOW, Bottas was too late in braking, play it back super slow....dumbo move. Wet track accident, NO WAY planned to happen, not like this...JEEZ. If you re planning to win, you gotta make it to THE END!
Bottas: LEEEROOOY JEEENKIINS!!!
Alonso has made a defense masterclass, lewis can't stop crying and geting angry. Looks like he isn't used to his rivals defending themselves
Lance stroll slipping under the radar, as the spotlight shifts to Bottas 😂
Russell seems to have the worst luck. First race he manages to score points for Williams and Latifi scores double than him. He should not have cheated though in the pitlane before the restart.
Red Bull: we're more competitive than ever this season! Mercedes: *Bumpercars it is.*
I missed the race, how did Verstappen not make up any places from 10th?
What was great about this race that Verstappen has only scored 1 point in 2 races! 🤣🤣🤣
Williams points finally. We can’t ignore that
Lewis the luckiest guy on planet .
King of kings Lewis suffer and keep looking at him
Fernando Alonso is pure masterclass! Happy birthday
Dude, Alonso still got it, i was watching this live on a website and the chat went nuts when Alonso started defending against Lewis. What a race!
Aston Martin is my love !! My fav !
Bottas had enough space to avoid the accident but he did it for a reason.
What a race. Thank you, F1.
FIA pushing Mercedes very hard and they doesn't even try to hide it at this point.
Alonso is back and Renault starts winning
Madre mía esto fue más premeditado que otra cosa 🤣. Aún así Hamilton primero que es lo que importa🥇 👍💪
I really wondered why nobody gambled and fitted dry tyres during Red flag.
Tito should of told Lewis make a decision before the pits
Toto: Bottas, how desperate are you for the second seat? Bottas: Yes
RB should get a fine for allowing Max to exit the pit with a car that had pieces falling off. They should have at the very least broke off all of the pieces and then allow him to leave. Then during the red flag tape like they did. Gio got 10 s stop and go for speeding and RB didn't get any penalty but pieces flying off the car could have hit someone and injured them.
Lewis: let me by!!!! Alonso: so, try
Just gonna put this here: Grosjean got a one-race ban for taking out Hamilton and Alonso in 2012. Bottas (even if unintentional) took out 3 other title contenders and gets a 5-grid penalty for Spa...  _b r u h_
Well done, Budapest!
E.P.I.C race (Everyone pinned in car)
40 year old and still got it! Incredible! Gutted for us bulls not being able to be as challenging due to the damage given.
James: "Valteri, it's James" Also James: "NOT THAT VALTERI, IT'S JAMES!!"
Bottas takes out both RedBull cars. Mercedes strategy has gone full on
Mercedes strategy to win when Red Bull matches their pace: take them out.
Those first 3 laps were absolute chaos 😂
F1 just became such a joke... Bumping cars, that's what it is.
This is one of the best races i have seen in a while.
The highlights don't do this race justice
Dude this is one of the weirdest and most amazing races ever.
If F1 had footballing terms, Alonso would surely get the Assist for Ocon's win :)
Valtteri, its Toto. You gotta go hard and brake late in the first turn ;)
Imagine Netflix on this day
Toto: Bottas, you don't have the place to win us the constructors.  Bottas: I have my tricks!
best race of the season
This was a 🎢 of emotions...
Bottas gonna get a bonus from Mercedes for this one
A bit of chaos and we get to see the best fights of this season!
I guess choosing this race to sleep on was a bad idea 😐
Verstappen's car got Fok Smashed
The merc masterBlan. Well done.
Bottas happy and satisfied with himself even after a DNF.....hmmmmmm I thought hard I wonder why ??? 🤔🧐😂🤦😛
What a piece of trash, that Bottas.
I am really eager to see Alonso next year with the new rules. He gave Hamilton a drive lesson with a really inferior car.
That's like something out of F1 97 that is
Let's get this straight, Bottas received a 5 place grid penalty for next race, for causing a collision that took out of the race Norris, Leclerc, Perez and destroyed Max's race. Sergio Perez will receive a 10 place grid penalty for changing power unit components because of the crash with Bottas. Perez has to pay a bigger price for doing absolutely nothing wrong compared to Bottas, who game-ended 4 drivers and gets exactly half as much penalty. Thanks for everything FIA. Yet another time Max's race is ended by a Merc.
*mad*
Bottas crashed on purpose, imho ..
this is how MB & Lucky Lewis wins the world championship if we can't beat them then use our break power... sick his last word at alonso its dangerous...... ask verstappen what lewis did :p all falls to mercedes also this year........ redbull fast pitstop, no that must stop...
I guess Bottas has a side job as a hitman when he's not working his full time job of being Hamilton's doormat
1 turn 2 bulls
Georgeeeeeeee😭😭😭
Bottas to NASCAR 2022 confirmed.
F1 Online in a Nutshell
Slow hand clap.... Well done Valtteri, not just one but both red bulls out, what a guy.  Deffo staying on Toto's christmas card list.  Yeah buy a Mercedes if you support a company who has to win at any price.
Alonso what team player!
Insane race from both Nando and Lewis, tough luck for the guys taken out first lap. Best race so far with all the drama
Max will be world champion by the year end. Period 🏆
(PT-BR) 1:18 Daria pra fazer uns bons memes com isso, não acham???
Mercedes having luck again
This and Baku is one of the exciting race I ever seen! ❤️🏁💥💯
That bottas crash seemed wildly intentional
Lewis "I took out max last race"..... Botas "Hold my beer"
One of the best races of all time! Rough start but man for some drivers this meant so much!
1:23 he finally found a way to say the most irritating repetitive saying twice in a race...
Hamilton shouldve changed tyres at the restart. Big mistake on Mercedes part.
Hamiltonno: Hey Valteri! Did you forget to push the steering wheel foreward like it happens to me sometimes, did you?  Valteri: No, I just don't want to cheat.
Hamilton on his way to becoming the GOAT
Toto: "Bottas, you see those two Red Bulls?" Bottas: "ok"
The Alonso-Hamilton fight could have been the entire highlights video
Extended Highlights please
Think Bottas has signed his departure with that.
'05 US Grand Prix ain't got nothing on that start.
Grazie seb ☝️☝️🏎🏎
Hamilton didn't look well after the race. It looked like he was going to faint. What happened? Just tired?
So this is what Crofty sounded like during the opening lap
best race so far,i was on edge with the alpine 1/2
Danii Torpedo Kvyat: do you guys miss me?   Valter Arrow Bottas: not at all!
Ocon fantástic job 🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
I can't believe Merc left Lewis on intermediate tyres at the restart of the race. You could see when they were getting ready to come out the pit lane that the sun was out.  That was a huge gaff again by Merc. They have cost him at least 5 wins over the years cos of bad judgement. Idiots.  However, it was funny seeing Lewis as the only one on the grid at the restart.
The most shocking thing for me is that mazepin goes out and it wasnt his fault
Bottas is going full Allahu Akbar on Red bull.
Norris caused it all
Are we going to ignore the fact that Williams got there first points in F1 since Hockenheim 2019? Also boosted by the fact it's a double score.
This was a a great race. F1 keeps getting better and better
Nobody talking about Bottas' strange comment on radio before lights out?  "Number 33, corner pocket, number 11, side pocket"
Russel finally scores points, Latifi out scores him🥲
Another planned takeout by Mercedes
Extended version needed
luck for L.H and Bottas cones Max out , the race that had to be from Totto Wolff .I hate that team MB and FIA= MERCEDES
I just want to say bravo to nico Rosberg the commentary was amazing in his 2nd language to be able to get his point across and provide great insight I love Martin Brundle but it's nice to hear someone who has driven against most of these guys and in the current F1 era
Hey Valterri this is James can you chrash into Norris that he hits Verstappen? Oh and Please crash into Perez too.
Mercedes have now got a Ferrari- inspired master🅱️lan.
"Excellent" LW with the best car by miles overtake everyone. How "sporty" this is. Specially with MV out
Most Exciting Race Of the Season So Far
Max max supermax 🤡
horner: take out 19 cars with 190 seconds penalty. wolff : thanks for the tips, Bottas please execute this plan. bottas: noted
Bottas is hilarious 😂😆
The bias of the commentator shows when he only refers to Merc and Lewis' recovery drive and not RBR even though Lewis suffered no damage in lap 1.
Ricciardo really messed up Verstappen’s race
Russel getting his first points in a Williams but still getting outscored by Latifi! 😂
I get it but do these accidents always have to knock out my favorite drivers.
Looks like 2007-08 season when Alonso and Hamilton were fighting for the place. Alonso, Vettel still got it. Had they be given cars like Merc or Red Bull they'd be on top of the table.
I feel sad for Gasly,Norris and Leclerc. They're performing so well this season qualifying almost every race in the top six and then in race like this when they've got the chance to win they get cought out in the Turn-1 mayhem because they started in the front.
Sir Cavalier Lewis Hamilton with his phrase  "it is so dangerous at these speeds" proves that he is just a spoiled child who has always considered himself superior to the others, he has considered himself the most correct, the most cautious and the one with the most experience, but after you send your rival to the wall at 300 km / h and you complain because a pilot does not even hit you but hinders you even 250, says it all about our knight of toys, shame
Bottas masterclass, contract renewal confirmed!
1:20 F1 2020 season in a nutshell
Well played Mercedes. What a string of highly convenient coincidences just before the summer break. Uggghh disgusting
Unglaubliches Rennen!  Ich bin heilfroh dass wir bei Sky Ralf Schumacher als Experten und nicht den neunmalklugen Rosberg haben. 👌🏻
The story of the day is: What a teammate Alonzo!!! Haha
Mercedes team makes the most mistakes!
Russell is loosing vs Kubica and Latifi.😎😆👌
Mercedes are destroying F1 i hate Mercedes they Will do any thing Just to win thats why i hate f1
I really hope Max vs Hamilton this year does not turn out like Hamilton vs Sebastian Vettel in 2017
Merecedes is just crashing the Red Bull’s out of the race
Mercedes blocked Verstappen and Perez in qualifying and also took out Perez out of the race while causing permanent damage to Max verstappens car. I have to say after they also crashed Verstappen out last race and sent him to the hospital im impressed no one has noticed their skummy cheating methods and taken action.
Feel bad for lando not his fault his streak ends I would be furious
That's some poetic justice Crashtappen is getting given how many accidents he has caused in previous seasons...
All salty Verstappen fans are just trying to find a way to fault Hamilton for Max's day and won't even accept that it was a great day for the sport and an intense race where Lewis showed his mettle.
Honestly I've tried to like his voice but the race commentator's voice is so annoying. High pitched, rapid, and for no reason creating excitement where there is no excitement. I have to put the video on mute to watch it.
Imagine having a regular conversation with the commentator, you're deaf afterwards.
Cyril Abiteboul was so happy to see this.
It s crazy how Lewis can be lucky
Bottas really said, "Aight might as well do it myself"
Crasy race 😁👍
Get in there, Valtteri! Awesome job, mate! You've done it! You've done it!
Monday bottas sign new contract with mercedes😂😂😂😂
Alonso just reminded Hamilton who is the best pilot here :D
Vettel in rainbow T-shirt / helmet... Typical left-green: weak mind, strong attitude.
So, time to read the comments and see how the anti Lewis mob manage to blame him for this. It might actually be more epic than the race itself.
Champions drive, from first all the way to the back of the grid and putting in a proper performance -  after all the booing people should have more respect for one of if not the best to ever do it
I want ALO vs HAM full highlight please
We need something on this legendary battle between Lewis and Fernando
4:00 Crofty_brain.exe has stopped working
ha ha knew it would go down like that! what a start max b crashing got crashed into hes done it before so cant be mad at it
5:44 Why Hamilton is using DRS being ahead of Sainz?
Bottas is playing kurlling
If Lulu also had pitted. 😃
Honestly: Thank you so much Valtteri, you have paved the way for the best race of the season so far!
so 2 race in a row 2 Mercedes caused 2 accident and gained the Team Championship lead?? that is the dirtiest thing ever.....
Way to go Bottas today you earned your renewal 🤩 you are the best, we need you to take out the Red Bulls again in the next race come on MaFIA 🤩🤩 Mercedes today we won with a VALTTERI ready to give everything.
So next race checo could take out both of the Mercedes and make max retake the championship lead
Hamilton had no water the whole race on a dry track and managed to get P3 after the mistake while battling 2007 Alonso. Dude is a beast. I hope he feels better because he was definitely dehydrated when the race was over.
The frame of Hamilton being alone at the race restart is so meme-worthy. One caption could be: “Lewis has managed to eliminate all his opponents. That’s how he’ll make sure he wins, by racing alone.” 1:19
If Mercedes win the Constructors and Drivers championship by a less than 30 point margin, they will know it was simply cos they were lucky rather than having the better car. I don't think Bottas did it on purpose but look at what that did to Red Bull - cost them strong points finishes today. Horner must be fuming.  Seems like Vettel may get DQ-ed due to fuel sampling issues. We shall see
Hamilton lookin' like he needed some of Tom Cruise's healing powers on the podium.
Crashing Hamilton and Co.
Alonso played great tricks to keep Hamilton at bay.
If Alanso didn't have that lock up, Lewis would still be behind him.
forget usa 2005, this grid(re)start is the weirdest ever.
So sad for Vettel, one bad pitstop costs him the win :(
Bottas doing anything he can to keep his seat. Taking out both Red Bulls
We need to remember...... Mercedes Work as only one team... Only one result...only one purpose...... Then.... That don't need so much explanation....
"Driving this way at this speed is dangerous" - Hamilton on the radio during the fight with Alonso  10/10 HYPOCRISY
Alonso defending like Michael Schumacher!  Still got it and shows what we're missing if he had a better car. Feel bad for Max bec he could've done something here.
Great job from Ocon but I would have loved Seb to be up there so badddd. He would have had it if it weren‘t for the bad pit stop
Seb allready two podiums this year ! Great move to Aston Martin👍🏻
Bottas: Angry Bird mode on !
Let valtteri out 1 race like Grosjean
The most undeserving championship lead ever for Hamilton
1:25 I don't think I've ever seen that lol
it needs to rain every race wknd i think
no one is talking about the fact that both williams drivers scored points AND LATIFI GOT MORE THAN RUSSEL
Why can’t the rule for crashing another car be paying the damage it got through the accident…(?)
Well the best thing is that Russel finally got some points!!!
I miss being able to watch this on tv
Mercedes : Kamikaze mode
Hamilton must've thought that Bottas took out everyone when he lined up on the grid alone. 😂
Alonso was just the Wow factor today. How wide he made that alpine was great. Also after the race waiting for ocon and letting him have his moment with his team. Great man and a great teamplayer
Back to back races Mercedes take out Red Bull cars..
💪🏽🇬🇧👍🏽great come back
Bottas surely gets his seat after this favour from Merc, right?
If only Carlos's pit stop was faster. Srsly, Ferrari needs a better and more consistent pit crew
Congratulations for Ocon. It's about time that FIA let the amount of the penalties depending on the damage inflicted. So taking out number three in the standing and the championship leader would be something like one or two race bans.
Max needs to see how alnoso and lewis drove today...how to defend and wait patiently....lewis with a mature drive...did not loose  his mind with alnoso...if you want to be a champion you have to be a mature driver...hope max learns one day...cz he is into his championship window
Let's get rid of Mercedes and its goons, and let's get our favorite sport back.
Most entertaining race of the season
i start thinking that mercedes doing this crashes on purpose...
Really happy for Ocon
It is incredible that the FIA ​​does not realize the method that Mercedes implemented for Hamilton to win the Championship
I really enjoyed this race. Full of thrill.
Amazing Alonso work
Alonso: Every time you have to leave no space!
STRRRRRRRIIIKKKEEE! Mercedes master🅱️lan being set into motion.   BOTTAS this is Toto: Great job Valterri. Pefectly exequuuuuted (German accent) 😂😂😂😂😂
F1 is getting so boring...instead of racing for 1st they just crash for it.
Imagine if Alonso had a red bull, we would be seeing an epic battle between him and Hamilton. Respect to the old man
I think Bottas did it on purpose, was so convenient
So, what caught my attention is the red lights going off so quickly on Hamiltons solo standing start. As far as i remember there’s always a few seconds halting after 5 lights. Am I wrong?
Bottas, this is James, take out the Red Bulls
Mercedes’ are punting out Red Bull’s like it’s going out of fashion
ocon and  Sébastien are very lucky if there was one more lap lewis would have been in first place
Mercedes clawing their way back into both championships by crashing into Red Bulls... doubt I will ever count this year for them if this holds up.  This year has really brought out the worst in Merc
GIGALONSO
I am super happy George Russell got a ponit
Bottas crashes and ruins the race for 3 other drivers: 5 place grid penalty  Perez gets taken out of the race and has to change engine: 10 place grid penalty   Can the FIA get more redicioulus?
I love Nico as a commentator🥂
Hey commentator why not shout a little louder !
im here just for comments
Hamiltons luck is actually upsurd. He should have a service where he picks people's lotto numbers for them.
Does Verstappen always have to play bumper karts to pass someone... He's terrible at overtaking
Bottas is the ultimate team driver
This is just a fever dream
Lewis, what are you crying about. Talking about how dangerous alonso is at that speed but putting max in the walls at the fastest corner at silverstone!
Mercedes MasterPlan
bottas kamikaze for mercedes
I knew Mercedes were going to crash someone out this week. They should be fined for the millions of damages they're causing all the teams.
To the FIA...Do something  about the output of these engines.  With the new vehicle regs and these crazy peacocks...somebody is going to get killed
Nando is our Patrón. This guy had the cojones to go 1 vs 1 with Hamilton and thereby saved Ocon's and Vettel's position. DoD well deserved.
Hamilton starting by himself was hilarious
Next race gona be awsome because max gona try to take 1 place again , ham will try to defend it , 3 week away folks
Its always frustrating when a driver gets a wheel spin. They immediately wanna retake position.
Lewis hit a RB last week. This week Bottas took them both out haha oh lawd 😂
Hamilton drove respectfully of other drivers…..do you think Verstaffen did???
I love Alonso
1:18 this moment personifies F1 between 2014-2020
Nice strategy from mercedes if we cant defeat them... eliminate them...maybe redbull should change their tactics too... dive bomb first lap ''racing incident''
No one talking about how Pierre Gasly stole the fastest lap
Los de Mercedes Ya lo hacen a propósito xd
Alonso gave PTSD to hamilton
Bottas must never interfere with other cars. He no longer has the concentration he needs as an F1 racer.
People are so extactic because Alonso blocked Lewis on a track where overtaking is notoriously difficult. Then they should be even more extatic when a rookie held up a two times world champion in the same car for a whole race without making a SINGLE error: Indianapolis 2007, Lewis beat a dejected Alonso. By the way, Alonso show his displeasure in the fact that his team McLaren didn't order his team mate to let him by, by weaving on the starting straight.
After this race, I finally understand why some people are for a reverse grid. Having drivers like Hamilton and Max battle the rest of the field and then each other would make for some extremely entertaining racing.
Ever question how is mercedes so fast?
Oh look at that, everybody against Lewis 😂😂😂😂😂
I think Luis did not pit because of marketing reasons.
Alonso: You cannot play bowling  Bottas: But I can
El Matadore
What a freaking mass this race was.
And the fact that there was no penalty whatsoever for taking 3 cars out of the race (all from the top 5)... This aint racing anymore...
Who is Torpedo now?
How is nobody talking about how Mazepin ran into a car in the pits and took himself out 🤣
Incredible race by Hamilton
F1 Open Lobbies Lap 1 Belike:
What a win for Ocon 👏👏👏
We need the full battle between Alonso and Hamilton
Hamilton vs rosberg😭😭hamilton vs bottas😂😂😎
Wow wow wow wow what a race
Regrettable
Bottas did his best to knock both Red Bulls out.
Congrats to Ocon and Hamilton who has damage to his car yet still climbed his way back to poll position...
Fake crowd noises. Liberty Media that's unacceptable
What a race!
I guess Mercedes decided to hire suicide bombers as drivers
We need a 30 minute highlights.  7 minutes is not enough to hold this amazing race.
One of the best races of the entire era.
I´ve enjoyed this sport since 2015... This is the last race I will have seen in a long time. Is there anything that prevents Mercedes from doing this deliberately every race?
mercedes winning by crashing redbull lol
Lol ocon happy he's one day contract , it's lucky win for him
OCON WINS! YES SO PROUD
Sir Lewis forgot that Alonso is also a world champion. Great defense from him. That gave Ocon a boost.
What a pleasant change somebody different for a win
That's why you pay Alonso. Great team work. You'll be crazy if you think icon won that without his teammate
Alonso's blocking Hamilton, Ocon's defending from Vettel make Alpine's victory  Congratulation!
¡¡¡MAGIC ALONSO!!!!
Bowler of the day : Valtteri Bottas
Phenomenal Race today.
What a great race! Congrats to Ocon and Vettel, also the rest of the grid. Shame to those who DNF'd.
Mercedes is cheater
Moto gp is more exciting than F1
😢😢 Ferrari
Toto: Bottas, if you want to keep that Seat, you Know What you have to do Bottas: Yes boss, execute order 66
Professional drivers 🤣😂
1:25 wow, it was a tough race...
Toto: "we are only one dnf away" Mercedes Drivers: "And I took that personally"
From bottas trying to destroy the RB cars to ocon victory and Alonso showing masterclass driving and also respect on the track batyles, something Hamilton will never learn, something Mercedes will never understand
Im so happy this was my first ever f1 race I watched live. Like, im, so lucky!
*Hamilton:* I don't know why I just can't get close to people. *Commentary:* That hasn't to do with *SOCIAL DISTANCING.*
Race of the year 100%
Amazing drive from the Ex Mercedes driver 👍🏻
Everybody talks about Bottas but Stroll did nearly the same?! Hitting Leclerc into Riccardo, because of to late braking
Mercedes master plan
So we are not gonna talk about latifi and russell scoring points?
Wait so bottas gets a 5 grid drop penalty but Hamilton at Britain got 10 seconds during the race.  It seems the rules are so mixed up what's the point, they need to fix the penalty system here
Bravo Ocon!
Well... Thats another way to get rid of your Rivals
Final nail in the coffin for Bottas at Mercedes.
alonso is INSANE
At least Allies won the Axis. Merc tactics make me sick.
2:45 …
Ocon should be shining Alonso's shoes, taking out his trash and any other mundane task he can think of!
Hamilton fans still crying for Alonso defense? They said to Max fans "Stop crying", but now karma hit them
Fernando and Danny ric both said you will not pass
If you can't beat them then crash into them... Best strategy
I truly hate Alonso but is such a great driver
Hamilton by himself on the grid restart. I thought everyone else had gone on strike 😅
was expecting vettel to win ,but awesome job ocon congrats sensational drive. p1🏆
Time to give Hamilton the respect he deserves. If you think Max could beat Hamilton? That's a wishful thinking and disrespectful to the 7x world champion 😂😂🤔
Increíble los Alpine en el top 5 Ocon 1 y Alonso 5 me ha gustado 😎
Mercedes tactics working perfectly. This is the reason Botas is there still amd not Russel. Can't have Hamilton  being challenged by his team mate instead of working for him taking out the opposition
One of the best races in the turbo hybrid era bar none
Its funny how the brits believe that Ham would have won if Alonso hadnt hold him up that long. They seem to forget that he had to overtake Vettel And Ocon too to win. And they would have been able to hold him up the same as Alonso.
Great Ocon! Brillant f1 driver
Funny how George out performs latifi normally but when they finally both score latifi is ahead 😂😂😂
although i don't rlly like Lewis but i must say this game he is really a beast, pushing so hard from 13th to 3rd! And congrats to Ocon on his pole position!!!
Feel so sorry for Max. I am a lewis fan but love seeing Lewis and Max battle it out. Feel robbed today a little but clearly an accident. Congrats though to OCON, VETTEL & ALONSO great to see some different front runners. Another cracking race! Loving F1 2021 so far!!
Yooo welcome back to F1 Kvyat
Definitely not intentional by Bottas 🤦🏻‍♂️
Alonso is the man to thank for the win
This was the most absurd race I have ever watched. Race leaders nearly all knocked out. Pace kept anyone from anyone moving up much. So confusing
Williams 8th in the teams championship. 😶
*Fernando receives fruit wine and cheese basket in his room, but no card  *knows it's from Max
Clearly Bottas fault
No comment
BOTTAS coming in with his renowned Rally skills! xD
1:23 *2005 United States Grand Prix intensifies*
Bottas Order 66
Enjoying WWIV in the comments like 🥸🍿
4.024❤🇮🇹
When tons of people trying to hold Hamilton Sainz : arrrrggghhh Gasly, tsunoda : only for a moment Alonso : hold my beer let me show you how to defend like a pro 😂😂
And nobody is talking about Williams first points for both drivers
FINALLY RUSSEL GET HIS FIRST POINT !!!
Mercedes Master🅱️lan
Bottas contract extension confirmed.
Ocon is such an underrated driver too
Alonso prevented Hamilton from winning
Danke Bottas
idiottas
That fight between Hamilton and Alonso was awesome.
Williams points !!!!!!
people still say that f1 is boring
I saw Bottas playing bowling last night. He realy got into it.
Finale for Williams
Hamilton should go skiing more often.
bottas : mission accomplie!
Rosberg tried…. 😏
Comments section highlights: Congrats to Ocon on his first win Hamilton solo on the grid Alonso brilliant defending stopped Hamilton from winning Bottas confirmed in Mercedes for 2022 Russel first points, but Latifi got more than him Mazepin crashed again
1:02 George: At this rate everyone is going to box for slicks. Everyone! Hamilton: Haha no we don’t do that around here!
Well whatever you say to lewis .. he is the best driver hands down, he started first, unfortunately got to 14th then again came back to the 3rd position i guess if he had got 2 more laps he would have definitely got better position but .. awesome awesome race, mature driver
Renault Alpine is the stuff of legends.
So now rosberg is the official commentator ?
Verstappen out on the first lap ☹️  Ocon and Vettel on the podium 😁
F for Max
Now i feel bad for missing this race...
If you need some motivation & Willingness to do impossible  just watch LAP 55  to LAP 65  of this race
Bottas got mad skills... Being able to take out all of Hamilton's potential threats for this race in just one corner
Who expected last race before summer would be THIS MAD 1. Verstappen - P10 2. Hamilton - P3 3. Ocon winning 4. Russell and Latifi scoring points for Williams 5. Vettel on Podium again after 2 DNF 6. 6 DNF in a single race Most amazing was Alonso being 40 driving an Alpine and defending current F1 champion in a Mercedes for so long
Kvyat: I am the one and only Torpedo  Bottas & Stroll: Yes, but also no
When a team has won 7 years in a row, and finally get some real competition..
For being the so-called "best drivers in the world", they sure seem to have problems getting through turn #1, on the opening lap.
The important lesson to take note from this race for Mercedes is " the tactics doesn't include alonso in 2019"
Can we talk about the fact the ocon wouldn't NEVER  win if Alonso didn't block Hamilton
"SIR LEWIS HAMILTON, F1'S DISGRACE HE DRIVES LIKE A MADMAN! CHEATS, LIES AND CRASHES CARS AND GETS AWAY SCOT FREE!"
driver or the day, Bottas took care of both red bulls 🤣😂
No body seems to care about the wonderful drive williams drivers had. They ended up in points for the first time for past many years. Congrats to them
Ocons new Chassis helped.
That was unexpected except Mazepin....that guy never fails to fail. :-D
Seems like an actually great race!
Alonzo the goat!
The yelling is ridiculous.
Just...what a fu**ing race man
All top comments about incidents..  what an awesome win by Ocon, congrats. And seeing Hamilton and Alonso going at it again like they started 14 years ago is amazing to watch
Legendary race. This is something that will be long discussed in the future.
FIA: Scrap sprint races. We need to try reverse grids.
Alonso is the man!!! Watchout for the next round from alpine..  No coment about the start accident !!!!!!!!! Hhhhhh....
Get in there russell!!!! 💪
I really don't get why everyone's blaming Bottas.. Dude he braked abit late and skidded on the wet tarmac and rear ended... Thats basic and i guess it can happen with anyone.. just leave that poor guy...
Bottas is the new pool master.. Watch out Efren Bat Reyes your legacy is at risk...
My only reaction after the race: *What was that?*
It was nice of mazzipan to crash right out side the pit, save having to haul the car.
war zu erwarten , aber jetzt mal ehrlich das ist doch 1000000 Euro extra wert für den Edelhelfer .Oder meint ihr nicht lieber Merzedes Vorstand
Lewis drove incedibly someone's got to mention that
who are the narrators? is that Rosberg?
goatmilton
WILLIAMS SCORED POINTS,ITS A MIRACLE!
This is not an open F1 online lobby Bottas...
mercedes 🤡
it's crazy to see how Hamilton goes from 14th to 3rd in what like 25 laps?
Lewis must be think while the restart: Valtteri that's too much, where is the fun.
Valtteri this is Chancellor Toto.. Execute order 66.
Mercedes: "We can't have everyone hate Lewis for taking Max out!" Bottas: "If I'm leaving Mercedes this season, I'm taking everything out with me!"
Ormai la formula 1 è peggio di iRacing. This is bowling, not racing.
Why isn't SEB much appreciated? ❤️💚 He deserves it today
closest race we will have to reverse grid
we didnt hear much of rosberg in this highlits haha pity  vettel did great
Bottas needs to go play Wii sports bowling at this point. would've scored a Turkey by now
Everybody is talking about how Bottas crashes his car with Norris and Checo, but nobody is talking of how Latifi has more points than Russel, Haas and Alfa Romeo; and he was in the podium at the start of the race
I hope George has lifted his curse now.
Disaster of race
best race of the season
James : Valterri, its.. Bottas : say no more fam
Watching Hamilton all alone on the grid at the restart was pretty hilarious
Alonso defense is so strong
vettel could have win this race but astons pit crew is slowest among all. Hamilton could win this one but hteir strategists are daf this year. So lets hurray for Ocon and Alonso, they did everything perfect
That's a unique way of trying to keep your seat in f1
New sticker on Mercedes in Belgium: We hammer competitors!
Bottas didn't choose the Torpedo Life... the Torpedo Life chosed Bottas.
1. 10 second stop/go for speeding in the pit lane 2. 10 second penalty for crashing your title rival out of the race  FIA logic
Mercedes-AMG by far best car
This is the most entertaining f1 race so far this season..
Alonso made Hamilton eat his own DRS. What a legend. So much pleasure to watch him this year.
Oh Dear
FANTASTIC RACE!!!!
мерсам черный флаг на 2 гонки
Just realized norris has lost his streak of points 😔
Can we appreciate both Williams being in the points 😱
Botas was like the tag team partner who comes over the top rope and take outs the competition
Alonso did a great job holding of Lewis. He won the race for Ocon
LA MAFIA INGLESA DE MERCEDES, HAMILTON, BOTTAS, RUSSELL, NORRIS, WOLF Y LA FIA!!!
Love to see it !!!!
Not an Alonso fan, but what a nice piece of selfless driving. To defend Ocon from Hamilton
That was one of the best races in the last 10 years!
LEEEEWIIIISSS!!!!
what a racexD
Apart from all the bowling excitement, why was Norris giving Bottas the break check? Overtook and show down immediately far too early for turn 1.
Fernando Alonso's defense from Hamilton was more than enough to take the victory for the team. CONGRATS Alpine
Toto's biggest weapon Bottas' bowling
So moral of the last two race....   "If u cant beat em, crash em"
Interesting tactics from Mercedes
Me, on my live ticker during the red flag, banging on F5: Come ooon, say something!!!! Live ticker: "Hamilton wins the re-start!"  Me: 😡😡😡😠😠😠☹️☹️😐😐🙂🙂😁😄😆😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Used to like Hamilton.
I’m an Alonso fan from now👌🏼👌🏼
Hamilton moaning about Alonso being unsafe .. hmm what exactly did you do Lewis at almost 200mph at Silverstone
Don't forget that vettel's slow pit stop cost him the lead. He deserves more credit for his performance
4:35 Its *MAGIC*
these commentators are so biased towards hamilton :(
Alonso was the second driver for Alpine, Aston Martin and Ferrari today
bottas should be awarded for what he had done sucker...😂
Fun fact: Alonso has held Lewis Hamilton behind him more than any other driver *combined* (in this race)
So merc masterblan is taking the bulls every race!
Waiting for max fans to say the lap 1 incident was hamilton's fault
Toto Wolf - We need to take out some drivers like Hamilton did last time Botas - hold my beer
Exciting race but still not worth the Sky Subscription. Bring back F1 on the BBC!!
Toto: Bottas, how much you want to stay in Mercedes? Bottas: Yes
Lulu Cameltoen complaining about Alonso. What a yoke.
Top Go Lewis
Russell: yeah points Latifi: yeah more points Russell:😭😭😭😭
Max...it's Ocon. xD
Alonso showed some serious racing & skills he got
Amazing drive for Lewis 🔝🔝🔝
am i the only one who cried at the end of that race??
See? Any race that Hamilton does not win IS A GREAT RACE.
So happy for Ocon a d Russell
MY question is why did mercedes not put when everyone else did lol.
We really really need an extended highlights for this race
Stroll 🤡
Gutted for Lando, what a great start
Ocon 🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵🇨🇵
Mercedes needs to be kicked out of F1
William scored some points :)
What an idiot move by stroll
I see latifi and Russell
Mercedes really likes hitting red bull off the track, like bottas didn’t even break and hit both red bulls , that’s two races in a row where they cheated their way to podium
that was amazing alonzo holding off hamilton aahhhhh
It is fantastic win Esteban Ocon. I don' know what happened with Verstappen. I think that he win . I very glad for Esteban Ocon. It is fantastic.
MERCEDES DID IT AGAIN 🤣🤣 CRASH STRAT IS THE BEST 🤣🤣🤣
What a race. Alonso is a beast of a driver. Bottas went bowling. Williams scored points. Its like the whole grid vs Hamilton now. Love itt
Hamilton and Bottas are the new Magnussen and Grosjean...
Nico Rosberg is a brilliant co commentator
Looks like Mercedes have a new strategy 😐
This race was amazing and so was Nico’s commentary, we need him every week!
Nico’s commentary has been on point through out the weekend, would love to have him alongside crofty for the future GPs
I wonder when we'll see Ferrari win a race. 🤭😀
Fucken merc now they getting bottas to take every1 out
Hamilton 🤡🤡
it was insane
Alonso, 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Bottas really want to stay at Mercedes 😂
Thanos clicked his fingers and only Lewis was on the starting grid.
More 3 Laps for Hamilton!!! Ai ai ai...
Hamilton the Little Girl
Mercedes masterclass strategy - when you can't win, take everyone out
Thank you Valteri for this amazing race
Doesn’t it look sinister. Another Mercedes taking out Redbull
Yuııuh bu nasıl bir komplo Acemi Piloot
4uck Mercedes, die können wohl nicht verlieren........
Mercedes wants to make F1 racing a StockCar race with the greatest raceCARD driver and his lapdog.
Williams Got Points too!
Thanks for posting.
Bottas deserver a race ban like Grosjean did after Belgium, but Bottas is Mercedes ohh ok 5 place grid drop is enough, OF COURCE!
gaming
Raikonen I love
They should always race in wet conditions
Great race in the end after T1 crash I thought easy Hamilton win. Wow it was action packed after Lights out and away Lewis goes Lol. Congratulations to Ocon Alonso and Alpine. Congratulations to Latifi George and Williams  Congratulations to Seb and Aston Martin Great to see Verstappen jr and Schumacher jr have a little battle.  Glad Lewis is feeling better Incredible defending by Fernando Alonso he truly helped Ocon and Seb in the end there. Great commentary by Nico Rosberg it was entertaining. Fantastic drive by Gasly. Awesome drive by Sainz. All in all it was an awesome race.
Race strategy for bottas: bowling ball
Lewis had some mega mega pace again. Max only 10th 😂 que horner crying at race controls door
Redbull 🏄🏾‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
May i ask why Russel did that in pit lane? Did he just do Karen thing? Won't queueing at all?
Two birds with one stone. That was another great dive bomb by Mercedes.
norris slowed down too much and bottas didnt expect that break early, and he went in front of him while he have space.. so norris fault for me
Bottas is doing everything to secure that Mercedes seat for next season
Mercdes: "Valtteri, Lewis needs more assistance from you in the races!" Valtteri Bottas:
Bottas takes out both RBs? Nicely planned. F! is a clown show. Like most pro sports these days, the winners are pre determined.
Alonso Saved Ocon
Fun Fact:This is the first race since 2019 Singapore GP to have a non Mercedes/Honda Powered Car winning
50% Alonso 50 % occon
The only times Hamilton has to battle anybody and he cries like a baby
Looser Mercedes
If you can’t beat them, crash them I guess. What a shorty way to win a championship.
all of veteran drivers contribute for hamilton to beat verstapen for drivers championship.
It was all calculated
Es una verguenza la F1 deja que Mercedes comets estos choque a red bull apropocito..
Unbelievable how unlucky Max is this year. Baku, Silverstone and Hungary should have been his wins (or at least second places). Hamilton had been so lucky this year so far. Red flags in Imola and Silverstone, Max' tyre blow in Baku. Just unbelievable how undeserved his lead in the championship is after all
Ocon owes alonso one
1:20 *Sees nobody in his mirror* "Where is everyone?? I told him to take out both Red Bulls, not the entire grid..." - Lewis, probably
Imagine this being your first f1 season
This netflix episode will be awesome
As a nascar fan I like to watch the highlights cause this is super interesting to watch
if there were 2 more laps, Hamilton would pass or win
What a race! also that restart has to be the most surreal thing ever lol
Glad so many people liked the race. I don't see alot of "crashtappen" and "fraudmilton" online. Well maybe the ignorant Max and Lewis fans are toxic again.
“If u cant beat em, take em out” -Toto
Pls make a video bout Alonso defending Hamilton
Mercedes musst be excluded from F1
Bottas did his best to keep his seat next years and take one for the team by crashing into both competitors off Mercedes under team orders. as always
Toto: Lewis we can win this!  Alonso: not if I have anything to say about it
Don’t forget to congrats Esteban !! Wp man
This is like the 4 th time I watched the race it was awesome
Mercedes was very nice to spectators... Giving up first place and all. More drama, more fun!
Ocon just wrote a perfect story today. He was born in a far from rich family and still became a F1 driver AND a race winner Unfortunatelly we don't see those kind of stories but today is the exeption
How did bottas became a race car driver?
Well done Ocon. Daniel Ricciardo must be having a hard time now realizing that it could have been him. Can’t see him standing on the top podium for the rest of his career. Loyalty does pay off, Mr Ocon. Congrats 👏
Today's race was f1 lobby...
Mercedes just knocking their rivals off the road
Crashtappen out
Feel so sad for lando
LFG Vettel
Even after the win, only a few r talking about him. Man..Ocon is so underrated.
Did merc hire Ferrari strategists? I can't believe they didn't pit. What a superhuman recovery drive by Lewis to get on the podium.
"F1 Drivers, it's Toto, let Lewis pass, let Lewis pass please; execute plan H"   Alonso: "Hahaha, I like ur sense of humor; imma destroy this man's All career".
Why has nobody mentioned that bottas and stroll will get  a 5 olace grid penalty next race in spa
Merc is getting very sus! Seem to messing redbull up a lot.
come al solito . questa volta e bottas e poi a 20 giri dalla fine cambio gomme e 4 secondi al giro . io tutte queste panzane non me le bevo .
Racing for the 2nd seat of mercedes 1. Bottas (two RB by one stone) 2. Ocon (first Victory) 3. Russell (first point for williams, however, his rivals like Ocon and teammate Latifi also perform better than him in this race, unlucky him. He really needs luck)
Winner of d day : Ocon Driver if d day : Alonso Take a bow guys!!!!
Thank you Bottas. GG!
Russell: *scores points* *Mercedes contract entered the chat*
These highlights don’t do Alonso justice
Best race so far i think
Clarkson: Alonso is my hero.
"at that speed it's so dangerous man" - Hamilton complaining 2 weeks after causing a collision at 290 kph corner
F1 is a field where you can see many racists as angry as ever!
Lewis showing why he's the GOAT, reaching a podium after being in last place. Had Alonso not done a brilliant job holding him up, Lewis could have been P1. Just insane pace
Toto: we are yust one DNF away , Bottas understood
Alonso can beat Hamilton and anybody else in the SAME car.
Fernando was the reason why lewis didnt got the win, grats on ocon but alonso is the mvp here
I am livin in Győr. It is 140 km away from the track and here was the whole day rainy. I can't believe how was this almost a full dry race...
if lewis wins 25 titles he will never ever be skillful and talented as micheal lewis has the most dominant car in f1 history in the weakest era ever and he has a teamate who is talentless weak and a very bad driver if micheal had this merceders and this generation he would have achieved records that no one could beat but him prime schumacher in equal cars would destroy and eat lewis alive
Are we all gonna ignore Lance Stroll masterpiece in turn 1?
So Hamilton overtakes without banging wheels with people, but Verstappen basically bashes Schuey Jr... Wonder why people are sick of Verstappens aggressive style
Bottas just pulled out a MVP move out there 🤣🤣
well, from now on we all know the new mercedes strategy will be to take the cars in front out of the race, they saw prostesting the red bull wing made no difference, complaining about pit stop speeds made no difference, so that's the new strategy, thanks Alonso for not letting them completely get away with it, they think F1 is destruction derby now.
Alonso in a mercedes or a Red Bull....He would win the championship  But what happened to the audio in the second half of the video?
why hamilton starts the race alone at the grid?
I will not be surprised if we see Perez dive-bombing Lewis nxt race
One of the worst days in the year for max fans:(
Forget one thing : both williams in points
The best battle of the race: Verstappen vs Schumacher. Also Jos Verstappen and Michael Schumacher were teammates at Benetton
Mercedes Master Plan. Just take out your opponents
@2:50 All the Verstappen fans who have been talking about how it's the overtaking driver's responsibility to avoid a collision....
Toto should give a raise to Bottas.
Alonso defendiendo 🤟🏼🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nico Rozberg WEF Jüngling
Massive respect for Alonso, he defended like a legend. He deserves more respect.
Bottas : Torpedo mode activate
pareciera que bottas lo hiciera aproposito, dejar adelantar a los redbull e intensionalmente alargar la frenada, fue el unico piloto que excedio en frenada... esto no es nada nuevo... de fijo en los próximos días sale que renuevan a bottas para el próximo año
Toto: Bottas if you knock off 1 Redbull we will contract you till 2022 If its 2 Then it will be 2023  Bottas: Copy that, ✅
Hamilton alone on the grid and alone at the podium stop, what a summary of his F1 career!!!
Mercedes master plan 😂
I wait for the moment negatives will be more than positives. This is the only way to understand you have destroyed your own product.
Bottas: i want to stay in Mercedes  Russell: old my contract
Hamilton being the only one on the grid for the restart is one of the funniest things I've seen in watching f1. What a race to get back into the sport with.
Stroll should be thrown in prison for that move into Turn 1.
Formula1 is alive again!! Hopefully the new car next year doesn't ruin it.
Bottas pulled a grojean at spa
last races amazing strategy by merc hehe
Max is really gonna have a beef w/ both Mercedes drivers after the break.  And Merci, Merci, Ocon!
" Bottas took out both red bull cars"...
Botas is getting a fat bonus today
Theo best Race since Airton Senna
What a race🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯wow
İDİOT BOTTAS
Requirements for easy championships: luck and fastest car
Bottas was aiming at Max 😂
Smells like a crash gate
What a MASTERCLASS driving of Alonso! The Rookie is a KING
Valtteri  BOWLING Bottas
I lost the race . Now I'm dying after seeing the result 🥲🤐😃
Mercedes is out of control at this point and needs to see some serious penalties. You can't just keep causing wrecks to take out your competitors.
The turn 1 carnage😂😂😂😂
Lewis' luck is ridiculous
Mercedes doing everything they can to sabotage red bulls it's sad.
Неожиданно😳
People hating bottas for no reason
Just goes to say Sir Hamilton is still the greatest of all time.  I know personally, Vesterpen can never match up with the kind of racing today.
Everyone brakes around the same time Bottas and stroll: no I don’t think I will
Bottas showing Hamilton how to do it proper in the first corner
May we just appreciate the fantastic commentating from Nico Rosberg this weekend? 👏
Bottas takes out both RBRs. How convenient.
bottas proved why he is the best teammate for lewis  see how far hamilton has come now ,He starts the race alone while others are waiting int he pitlane  lol ;)))))
Bottas really is a team player compared to Hamilton. He doesn't take out his championship rival, he takes out the constructors rival instead. What a hcamp.
Alonso to Red Bull anyone?
stroll is such a disaster
Bottas should be be banned from the next race! This was Mercedes tragidy
All four drivers fighting for third place in the drivers championship out. All four of them. Funny
Wanted to see Seb win, but happy for Ocon nonetheless.
Isn't that Rosberg commentating with Crofty ?
Congrats to ocon for his forst F1 win.  Respect to Fernando for defending like he did.  Big mistake on Lewis' part to not change to the medium tyres on the restart. That is really what cost the win here.  That start though was wild!
Williams got 6 points ❤
Be proud Hamilton, this is how you win.
The restart reminded of indy 2005
WHAT A CRAZY RACE
All these idiots that think bottas actually meant to crash 😂😂
Bottas races the same way I do in my playstation game
Bottas the curling master.
What's wrong with the audio on f1tv? I can only heat pitlane audio...
Verstappen really doesn't deserve this bad luck...
no one could defend 1 lap against hamilton yet Alonso Brilliantly kept him back for several laps with a Much much inferior and  slower car .. Just  Amazing  Respect 👊
Red bull needs to bring back Kvyat if Mercedes is going to keep doing that
Victoire français Esteban Ocon❤️
this was an online multiplayer start
ALPINE OVER MERCEDES WUT IN THE
Bottas wanted to show that he is important for Mercedes in the first corner 😅
Bottas is dangerous VERY DANGEROUS
Cant lie but what a drive from LH
😠 no interest in F1 anymore I will quit completely watching this sport. Just kicking out opponents even though they being experienced drivers is something fishy for sure.
El mayor robo
Hamilton started on pole then ended up on the back of the grid fought back and finished in P3. What an amazing drive.
And this is the race that won mercedes this years championship
Oh how close Danny Ric was to getting out of that carnage... if he'd avoided Leclerc he would've been ahead of Ocon and Vettel, could've been a win for him...
Alonso doubled his legacy today
Fernando did so well to protect the team's win. Happy for Vettel getting another podium!
The graphic said "Hamilton in striking distance of Alonso in 3 laps - overtake difficulty = 2/10 easy" lol. Imagine Alonso in the Red Bull.
Happy for ocon but feel bad Hamilton
Alonso blocks the whole road for hamilton
bottas actually helped his team. his seat's still safe for now
Alonso is master of races!He is alive legend of Formula 1 !And he is been ,have and will be the best driver that selfmade !The best and  master of speed!He is fight as lion !And especially its honorable that its after his Birthday in 40 years old and in celebration week!Great job!Great points for team!Bravo!Vamos,champion!What a fight!U are always my hero of motorsport!And winning of Alpine and Ocon is authonatically and victory of Alonso too and all team!And 5 place for Fernando is too as 1 !I am happy for them both!Carlos Sainz too have great place at this race!And its was amazing race and fight!Thanks.Vamos,men!Bravo!
Really impressive by Bottas, crashing 4 cars in one corner
"Valtteri this is James, we need an easy race for Lewis."
Anyone else almost find themselves falling asleep this race?
If anybody here is new to F1, you can get a full summary of 2014-2020 by watching 1:24-1:27 . Slight exception for 2016
Mercedes strategy 🥶🥶
Boooooo......
1:18 every LH44 fan want to see this 😔😔😔
How crazy does it have to get for alfa romeo to score some points?
Latifi the goat sneaks up and gets 4 points
I told you this Alonso guy is a promising rookie
Say what you like about Lewis, but when he's fighting through the field, he's sensational to watch.  That fight with Alonso was a thing of beauty.
Bottas:  yes I get to keep my seat next year Toto: well done valterri
congrats David de brivio
I didn't get to watch the full race yet, how come Verstappen couldn't move up through the grid but Hamilton could, in the highlights at some point they were just two places apart after Verstappen pitted and Hamilton overtook him on the undercut... Can someone fill me in on the details? Why was Verstappen held up so much behind the 10 or so cars in front of him but Hamilton wasn't held up by the 10ish cars in front of him??
Lewis: Let me pass Fernando the Grey:  I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass!
OCON WON
alonso defence just better than my immune system
Bottas' private bowling alley 🎳
2 races in a row a Merc driver gets the Bowling Ball Award
Best race everrrrrrrr
🅱️ottas being 🅱️ottas
Fernando freaking Alonso is still a badass, just in case anybody doubts it.
interesting tactics
Oh the memes this race will produce... can't wait!
If Mercedes and Hamilton win the title, I guess Bottas is keeping his seat for being a team player.
Its so sad that the AM pit was a second slow, that was the difference for Seb's race.
Bottas is the new Torpedo
I'm pleasantly surprised by the race results. Ocon win, both Williams in the points.
Stunning race from Ocon, he really proved he was a top driver, and shout out to every pilot this race was absolutely incredible,
Vettel🇩🇪 💪 world Champion 2021 😂
Hamilton: "Accidents happen. Just hard racing." Bottas: "I will execute order 77 so expeditiously."
WHAT IS HAPPENING
Hamilton crying because he can't go over Alonso. Masterclass for him. Same conditions , Alonso is the BEST
Not in the realms of conspiracy here but it makes you wonder if Bottas had team orders... If you get my drift here. Congrats to Ocon. Great race for him.
Bottas seemed like a man on a mission!
Boottas doing the Terminator scan "ENEMY! ENEMY! ELIMINATE"
The worst of races. The best of races.
Mercedes cheating again
best race of the season
Bottas just secure his sit for next season.
THIS RACE AAAAAAAAAA
That  pit stop cause Seb his 1st victory in Aston martin..Not lucky enough for my hero..i think he will win someday when he stop carrying the 🌈 flag...
This commentator makes the race/highlight so much more exciting and enjoyable!
As Hamilton has started demolishing the so-called formulate gods, the red bull  moaners will come here and find excuses. I thought Verstappen could do wonders to get on the podium as Hamilton did but lo and behold he was battling the average cars in the 10th place
I really don't know what's wrong with the merc drivers and I swear if mercedes fan boys say it was lando's imma come to your guys house and shoot you with a AK47 500 times
and to say that 1 rewind could have prevented all of this... happy they didn't though
lol merc not leaving bottas next year after what he did for ham and merc today
Bro, that crowd sound effect sounds so bad. Why didn't they use the actual audio?
From living in Caravan to GP Winner :D
Mercedes are getting more and more aggressive with their tactics!
Hamilton is just the best driver.
RB should just have Perez crash out Hamilton turn 1 of every race for the rest of the year cause clearly the worst they get is a 10 second stop go
This result makes me so sad. Ocon winning a GP before Gasly, first race into points and Russel’s behind Latifi, Carlos missed podium, Noris and Max taken out at first corner… All because of someone who was totally incompetent with his car.
Champ to Alonso!
You have no idea how sad it makes me to see Ricciardo get lapped.
PUT SOME RESPEK ON LEWIS NAME
Bottas knows how to eliminate the competition.
Toto: "we are only one DNF away" Bottas: "wait what-"
What a race
Why fall back to ram entire front field
If the Dutch decide to gun down Mercedes drivers at the next track ..I'm with you , let's invade britania
Somehow, Hamilton being all alone on the grid whilst everyone else still in the race were in the pits for a tire change ended up being one of the funniest, meme-worthy things this whole season.
lol it’s hilarious seeing only one car start from the grid
No one: Bottas: "so anyway I started blasting"
It's a shame the damage to Max's car robbed us of a potential battle as him and Lewis fought their way up the field, but we were treated to so many amazing moments in this race. Loving the sport right now.
Bottas once again being the perfect number 2
Bottas got a spare. David Coulthard still remains the only one with a strike
Latifi the goat
Mercedes tactics taking Max out of the race for getting life easy for Lewis crash Hamilton to win another  F1 Championship...this F1 is a joke
WHAT A RACE
another great team effort for Mercedes , thats how you win ..just eliminate the competition , that easy
Just wow
Stop yelling!
Only cheaters started from the grid in the secound restart 🤡🤡
Also Verstappen pulling the same stunt he did on Hamilton with Schumacker, but this time the other pulled back!!! SMH!!!
Ocon win only becase beautiful defence of Alonco.
So Verstappen ist doing again his agressive style.
See, Verstappen knows very well how to avoid accident with Schumacher from the outside.
back on top on the drivers and constructors championship points! if mercedes wins it this year. are we seriously going to have to look back at the british and hungary grand prix and say that was the turning point or controversial races?
Mercedes strategy: We'll always win if there's no rival able to race at all.
Alonso got a trophy from his team mate as a birthday present
I dont know wether to be happy for ocon or sad for vettel but both did outstanding today
What a race, gave me chills throughout 👏
Stroll and bottas have got 5 place grid penalty for next race
I like how bottas singlehandedly took out 4 drivers then sit at the trackside rethinking life choices.
Russell just secured his Merc seat
Hamilton is like that one student in the class who gets an A on the hardest exam where everyone suffers.
Ocon did great to hold vettel back
Toto: We can win this!  Narrator Voice: *They couldn’t win this*
Mercedes is sabotaging just becaus max was first
this race alone can make the whole 4th season of DTS
M E R C E D E S  M A S T E R  P L A N
Those last laps between Alonso and Hamilton were amazing. Wait, now that I think about it, didn't Ocon and Alonso win their first races in F1 in the same circuit?
russell is the future
Time to start black flagging Mercedes *team* every single race.
40 year old Alonso still got it. Defensive masterclass, what a day for Alpine
Some Vedic Astrology Points....  1. Lady luck will always be favorable for Hamilton if  one could understand how the Universal Cosmic Energy works. Hamilton has strong possibilities to win 8th title.  2. Max Verstappen has a strong Moon and Rahu conjunction, which will always pull his legs at crucial time and this conjunction will also not make him a consistent winner. 3. MAX has only less possibilities to become a consistent champion. He will make his own mistakes. 4. Norris and Russell may win races in future (2022), and may become champions also in the years to come. 5. In future, for quite a few years there will be different champions. It will be quite hard to match what Hamilton achieved. 6. Mercedes will face tough competition with other fellows.
Finally russel yeahhhhh
Ricciardo literally let Hamilton pass there. Probably holds some grudge against RB and Max
Even as a Redbull Fan: What a hilarious race😂
Mercedes should be fined heavily for reckless selfish drivers.
We need Alonso vs Hamilton highligthts as well as Alonso vs Russel video was.
Thanks Fernando...nice defense
Bottas took half of the tope ten runners in one swift move. Honestly impressive
TOTO STOP PLANNING TO TAKE OUT RED BULLS
Ever since Ocon ans Perez were on force India, I knew they had the potential to be front runners, and now they've both won a grand prix, and I couldn't be happier
What a thumbnail
Enshish commentators are just so bad...
Formula 1 comment section is so toxic
Hamilton : Alonso can be overtake in 8 laps Alonso : Am i joke 😂😂
Renault CEO told Ocon is not a championship material. Now he shows his potential to Renault CEO... Well deserved first place to Ocon... 😊
Ocon well deserved. Congrats! Finally F1 isn’t just Lewis Hamilton anymore.
Bottas crashing into Lewis and flames all over for 5min... Perfect!!!!
BOTTAS: I'll do a Maldonado s move now
Those who thought Hamilton was just winning cos he had a better car, there you have it. Masterclass driving right there under pressure. Get in there Lewis!!
Williams scoring their first points
Fernando con un Alpine retuvo a Hamilton durante 10 vueltas y este solo le pudo pasar por un error, sin embargo, Sainz con un Ferrari no le aguanto ni dos, eso demuestra el calibre de piloto q es Alonso, no tiene mas campeonatos por mala suerte y malas decisiones.
What a nice play for vettel and ocon 🔥🔥🔥
Hamilton : *this race is mine*  Alonso and Mercedes’s strategists: *let us introduce ourselves*
That’s one of a kind start for Hamilton probably no one else will ever have
Ocon Win, Williams in the points, Schumacher fighting in the mix, Fernando being a beast of a teammate, Lap 1 crash with no injuries, Bottas spicing up the rumour mill. Seb Vettel on the Podium.😅😅😅😅😅 Proper Race!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bottas "my mission just broken both of redbull car" 😂😂
LETSS GOO OCON MDFCKING SCHUMACHER LEFT HAMILTON FOR 2 RACE BEHIND HAHAHAHA EVERYONE IN F1 HISTORY AND NOW>Hamilton
Wow... mercedes is really desperate for those points.
This Mercs fanboys questioning the "Conspiranoic theorys" as some delulu nonsense as if we F1 fans have forgotten about Renaults 2008 Singapur crashgate. This fans really thought they are slick. But only proofs how lack of common sense the have
Verstappen 😀 👍 💪 😀  Hamilton 👎👎👎
Alonso showing them youngsters how it's done. Hands down, the best bit of defensive driving in years.
Bottas earned his paycheck today!
Alonso could have crashed Hamilton out of the race, instead he defended cleanly. Seems that all the drivers in the "top tier" teams should learn a thing or two about overtaking
I want to see a replay of the race start pit stops, I'm curious to see how the teams managed to double stack all their drivers in an overcrowded pit lane
For those of who dont know bottas did it intentionally. They wanted to take out both redbulls but verstappen could move on. A 5 place gird penalty is a joke for this it should be a Race ban
40 is just a number you know!!!!!
Bottas must have been practicing in forza open lobbies
luckmilton
its like a chess match, botas killin two knights to protect the king...nice one
Really happy for Ocon, man of great skill indeed 👏. What a recovery drive from Hamilton 🥳🥳
I don't understand the hate on Lewis. He's one of the greatest driver doing some great things for the sport and fighting for many controversial issues with the platform he has. He also puts on a masterclass recovery drive and yet I don't get why people hate him
Ah yes seeing that f1 is getting more ridiculous every year xD such bs motorsport
Bottas: Redbull, it's your cousin! Let's go bowling!
As an Alonso fan, I will never forget this race. He defended from Hamilton in a slower car in older tyres which are of the slower compound.
Alonso has still got the edge. He held of Hamilton at the very end just to make ocon win, this is F1.
mercedes masterBlan, I feel so bad for all the drivers who are involved.
Did we forget about Williams?
That crash has to have been planned
Go go go Williams!  And no. It wasn't ping pong, nor bowling. It was curling.
I've become an Alonso fan today!
Order 66 was executed pretty well
Pro and talented Alonso  Hamilton just has a faster car
What a race
I dont think bottas's crash was intentional, He wants to race for his seat why would he do a thing like that intentionally? Brilliant drive from Alonso!!
This is too obvious. bottas calculatedly destroys both Red Bulls.
One of the strangest races I've ever seen.  Bottas doing his job as a wingman to take out the RBRs. Hopefully he gets a race ban, totally ruined the race and the championship. Cheats.  Massive mistake from Mercedes to not pit Hamilton on the restart, almost looked like they did it on purpose to avoid winning with ease and then getting backlash for it.  Hamilton just spent the race whining. Another hollow title to come for him. Most undeserving champion ever.  Alonso driver of the day, the guy is just unreal. Put him in a top car and he'll win titles with ease.  The championship is over for Max. Hamilton has all the luck, the better car, fresher engines, better reliability etc. On top of Mercedes cheating to win.  Great race for Ocon, Vettel, Sainz, Gasly, Latifi and Max.
I feel like Mercs taking out Bulls is gonna be a theme rom hereon out.
F for George who could have lead the race
Man the blatant Lewis-stroking these commentators have is nauseating. "Coming back from 14th on the grid" fool the man started 1st
Toto - Execute Order 66 Bottas - Yes, my lord
Why is the commentary box so openly biased while Rosberg tries to put an impartial opinion. Bring such people in there, else it snatches all the interest from their blabberring.
I thought dive bombers were last used during WW2 didn't expect to see a couple of them in F1
In completely unrelated news: Mercedes confirms Bottas' contract renewal until 2025
Congrats to the williams 8 n 9 place. Ocon great drive congratulations.
I can't believe, that Hamilton said that it's dangerous to do that (Alonso) at high speeds, after what happened two weeks ago.
Question for you two both:  Bowling or Ping Pong?
Mercedes hitting max at turn 1: It’s even funnier the second time!
Behold: Bottas The Bull-Seeking Missile
Btw the only reason Lewis started alone is to hide the fact Bottas paid one for the "team". Mercedes and Lewis are big cheaters imo.
Bottas MVP :)
Bottas the torpedo
"Execute... Order... 66"
History made here
Where was crofty at the beginning of the live race?
bottas proved why he is the best teammate for lewis
best race this season  also bring Rosberg into commentaryt box more
Where are you Max fans to slate Bottas? If it was Lewis that caused that crash this comment section would be lit up 🤔🤔🤔 pick & choose I guess
Reality can be whatever you want it to be.  A meme?  That's not what I meant.  I choose memes.
Alonso didn't turn 40 last week. It is just 25, Season Two. Awesome defending from him! Team player :)
saw the race.. just came to see hate on bottas and merc lol
Best race of all time
Can we just appreciate how well Max drove with that damage
I AM SO HAPPY THAT HAMILTON LOST HE IS SO OVERRATED PUT HIM IN WILIAMS AND LETS SEE CAN HE BE CHAMPION TODAY WE SAW HIS REAL FACE LIKE LAST TIME HE CANT WIIN IF HI IS NOT FIRST ON START ALPINE AND ASTON MARTIN LEFT HIM BEHIND HAHAHAHA
Alonso wins the Grand Prix!!! That was a drive that only a champion can produce!!!
Maybe instead of new race format maybe we should try different  starting formats. It's formula one not bumper cars. If thats what I wanted then I'd watch Nascar
Anakin Skywalker: "Now this is F1 racing"
So..  -Lewis completely messed up at imola, but gets lucky with an immediate red flag and is able to restore -Max tire blows at baku - Max gets DNF in silverstonr after hamilton crashes into him (and lewis gets an immediate red flag where he can fix his front wing damage) -Max gets bulldozed by bottas in the first corner at hungaroring.   AND max will get a grid penalty at one point because his engine was damaged after silverstone...  Either lewis is extremely lucky or Max is extremely unlucky.  It makes this season very interesting and extremely frustrating
Toto: Valteri execute contract extension
2018: it is Hamilton, Vettel, YOU 2021: It is YOU, Vettel, Hamilton
Hamilton legend
WHY is this guy always shouting this much? We are not deaf!
Can someone explained what happened with the Hamilton thing? Starting alone at the beginning of the race
Mercedes taking out people again. How am I not surprised at all right now?  However, I'm pleasantly happy that Alonso did not lose his title of "King of Understeer" by purposefully sacrificing entrance speed to gain more speed and traction at corner exits. Amazing work.
5:50 hungry xd
Fraudmilton winning again due to Bottas demolition derby😏
50/50 bad: Hamilton somehow came back while Verstappen couldn't  Great: Esteban won and Seb got another podium
Pérez was a very unfortunate driver this weekend... First can't make the final attempt on qualifying, then just manages to dnf with a similar accident to Verstappen. The guy is always on the wrong position at the wrong time. Bottas on the other hand is spectacular at snooker...
Alonso is a legend!
Bottas comes in clutch with that power play I must say probably saved his seat for next year at least
Sainz lost 6.5 seconds in 2 laps to loose the podium..lol
Bottas f***k 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻
Yes Ocon
Lewis: "I ruined a Red Bulls' race last time, you can't beat that!" Bottas: *Hold my beer*
Hamiltons Luck is unreal
F for Lando
I think its safe to say #1 and 2 are already decided but #3 I got no idea who will win #3 by the end
bottas on interview  reporter : what happened valtery? bottas : toto sent me an email when the start. i try to read it and i didnt see lando there
Bottas: crashes into every one Massi: Hey Toto, are you going to email me this time?
Top 10 british formula 1 drivers:  1. George Russell 2. Lando Norris 3. Harry Kane 4. Harry Potter 5. Tom Holland 6. Harry Styles 7. Rahem Sterling 8. David Beckham 9. George Russell dad 10. Jack Aitken  Did I miss a fraud diver?
As soon as Bottas loses P2, "Valtteri, its James"
1:23 pretty much sums up the last couple of seasons of F1
Okay then lap one!
Keep this up, and Merc will be synonymous with crash 4 win
It's always nice to see Vettel on the podium 👍🏻
As a Verstappen fan, come on people, do you really think Bottas is trying to hit and hurt people intentionally?  Yes, its a big mistake he made, but its racing. These things can happen.  Would love to see those keyboard warriors do better in these conditions..  Besides round one chaos.. its great to see Vettel on the podium again and fatastic racing of Ocon and Alonso... And ofcourse a shoutout to Williams of having both drivers in points !!
Max taken out by Mercedes 2nd race in a row. Great sport, this.
Nothing incredible about Alonso defending Hamilton... not very easy to pass just like Monaco
Is it me or do all commentators sound the same
Maybe-future Mercedes driver on the podium, green Mercedes second on the podium and black Mercedes 3rd on the podium.
0:06 Toto:Bottas,how slow can you go? Bottas:Yes
Valtteri this is James we need you to punt both Red Bull’s for Lewis
Alonso is next year Verstapen teammate. He need blocker like Botas is for Hamilton
Thats why i will never like Hamilton although i respect him . He said clean defensive masterclass racing is dangerous and complaints and last race he did not back off with 280 kmh from a corner with a car besides him .
Race of the year!
Bottas ruining 4 drivers races
that tactics button on the mercedes pitwall worked
Bottas straight up trash!!! He should only allowed to be a test driver
It's like Forza online lobbys lolol
Wow Mercedes that’s a low blow.  Now sacrifice Bottas to get Lewis on top.  Can’t win straight out!
I would have punted Hamilton into oblivion;)
Bottas and Stroll gets 5 grid place penalties for next race, while Lewis only got 10 seconds at Silverstone. I don't understand how these penalties are decided. It sedms very one sided for me.
So, four takeaways from that... 1) Mercedes have a new strategy - destroy Red Bulls cars till they hit the spending cap. 2) George Russell won't ever be allowed to challenge, much less beat, Hamilton. 3) Fernando Alonso still has another world title in him. 4) Nikita Mazepin needs to be 'let go' urgently.
Bottas did such a great job for Mercedes today, truely did what mercedes needed the most ! 5 place penalty is perfect to do it again in Eau Rouge at Spa !
Give massive respect to Lewis Hamilton, dude is not 7 times wc by chance. If not for Alonso he will win this race. We move
Roman Bellic: "Hey Valtteri, let's go bowling!"
Hi
Both Ocon and Vettel should say big  thanks to Alonso....If Alonso didn defend Lewis tan u guys wil b 2nd and 3rd....and first wil be Lewis...tats for sure
Sebastian Vettel is best
It's light out and away Hamilton goes
Can anyone explain to me why this amateur Bottas is still driving in a Mercedes while they have a huge talent in the waitingroom. The only thing I can think of is that LH don't want it. Is he scared of Russel ?
I like the fact that anytime people wish bad for Hamilton it’s literally happens to their own driver.
This is a legendary day for Alpine: a surprising and amazing victory by Ocon and a masterpiece race by Alonso!
Mercedes is so slimy…
bottas and strolllaaaa ridiculos dois horroroso
2 Redbulls in turn one! Nice job! Damage in bottas car is worth it
Typical first corner in low elo GT online.
Everyone : *"BOTTAS"*
So we know now Mercedes tactic till the end of the year. Just trash other cars so hamiton wins the title
Hamilton after corner 1: "where is everybody?" Hamilton on the restart: "where is everybody?" Hamilton after pitsstop: "where is everybody?"
closed the live when I saw verstappen out, these races are becoming a joke
Max verstattpen U can't win that wc title 🤣🤣
RB: We must get them tomorrow!  Bottas: Not on my watch
Seeing Ocon win ruined my sunday. I wouldve loved to see Vettel win this one.
Alonso the greatest!! Come at me if u want to Lewis fanboys..
Bottas just secured his seat for 2022.
Mercedes plan for today race bottas take out both red bulls for Lewis great job boys
If you can't beat redbull just make them so they can't race. On 2021 If vers had accident then mercedes can win.
Alonso and Ocon is one highly underated duo!!
Y don't care any opinion, Alonso is the only winner of the race🤷🤷
Boooo
Bottas: Knock Knock, Red Bull. Red Bull: Who there? Bottas: Singapore 2017 Red Bull: Oh shi- Toto and Hamilton: Sbinalla  Russell: I'm off Mazepin: Same. Sauber: AYO  Hamilton: 2005 all over again. Alonso: That'd be 2007 Ocon: No, 2008 Hamilton: You guys can't win, you're in a backmarker Alpine. Alonso: Goodbye Fukboi activate the Eurobeat.  Hamilton: Pronto, Toto. Toto: Yes? Hamilton: Can you give me Eurobeat. Toto: Just press the accelerator harder. Hamilton: I am. Toto: Fine.  Ocon: This is like 2020, 2008 and 2017, I win.  Latifi: Hey Russell, how many points in total do you have. Russell: Now 4. Latifi: And how many points did I get? Russell: Fou- AYO!
Serious 2008 Singapore GP flashbacks !!
Bottas the torpedo.
Man I feel for Valtteri, he is a solid driver but has had a very unlucky time recently.
Bottas should be finalised heavily on this,.
Lewis Hamilton would have passed Alonso with ease had it not been for the many corners
That lonely start was hilarious
Taking out other drivers is the new formula 1 game for team mercedes.
Alonso keep up lewis behind so lewis cannot catch up with ocon. Alonso himself could possibly fight sainz with fresher tyres but he chose to help his teammate. What a man.
Totto: 'Bottas, you have to do your best to not let Verstappen get close to Hamilton!' Bottas: 'But how do I do this??' Totto: 'You'll know what to do .. when the time comes !.' . "Bottas sees Norris passing him and lining up with Verstappen..." Bottas: 'So that's what he meant?! Ok, I will make that sacrifice!!! '  CRASHHHHHHH !! RED FLAG !!
I would like to see an asterisk at lewis' scoresheet added: *had the pace advantage
Bottas’s crash was just a part of Mercedes master plan.  Justice for max.
No mention of double points finish for Williams come on F1 ?!!
1:19 what a sight, never seen something like this
Ughh is this really how Mercedes play their card?????
Wow, what a race! Congratulations to Ocon for the win and to both Williams for the points!
Rosberg : how to master hongroring Bottas : how to be hongaroring legend
NASCAR takes two weeks off.   Start of F1 race; hold my champagne!
best moment of the year: Hamilton alone on the grid
Lewis: I AM BACK!
Awesome team strategy for Merc. taking out both RB.
And there goes Norris' points record
Crazy race best in awhile
Mercedes strategy for Redbull - If you can't beat them in the race , take them out of the race!!
Everyone talking about Alonso and Hamilton but they forgetting about Scumacher taking the “you shall not pass” too seriously by running Verstappen of the track and him retaliating with a “lol you thought” and smashing him out of the way
I’m starting to respect Hamilton.
Felt some American GP vibes on that restart
I am the only one who gets tired of British bias from the commenters and the highlights? I know they are British but come on...
Seen too many comments about Alonso defending guys remember dry stable weather bigger team has advantage windy hard debris small teams has advantage Lewis made mistake first minute. He drove amazing got valuable points
Am I the only one that noticed Russell got 2 points
It really feels like bottas was given the mission of taking out red bulls turn 1 since his points mean nothing really lol
Yay! George finally scored points in that Williams! It’s been a long time coming!
It's disgusting how lucky hamilton is
Can we appreciate the fact that the RedBull crew fixed a car in under 30 minutes, while also making a 1.8 sec pit stop?
Awesome
Thank you Bottas,for this amazing race that you were able to give to us.  You're not a leader,not a wing man. But today you have given,us as a spectators great race. We were able to enjoy,some Hamilton vs Alonso that we missed for a long,and Vettel fighting for 1 place.  Even Latifi for Williams got some points.  If only u should have hit Ricciardo,not Norris that would be Epic 👌
hamilton reminded me of mcqueen lol
You mean to tell me this isnt F1 2020 Open Lobbies?
Bottas sabotase
Aston martin hired ferraris pit crew else vettel could have taken the lead of the race.
Alonso mvp👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The lesson we learnt from Alonso's thrilling fight  with Lewis is that it is not only about the car. You also need a man. Unfortunately for Ham's haters, he has been many times a man than any other driver in the history of F1.
I've said it before during this season and I'll say it again - Alonso can compete for the WDC if he is in a competitive car - today reaffirmed the fact that he has lost none of his race craft
James : valterri it's James initiate torpedo mode .
Tão roubando o vestappem na cara dura
red bull gonna soon raise war against mercedes
Bro I feel like if Alonso didn’t defend like that ocon wouldn’t have won
Crash in the first corner Bottas: Im sry guys Toto: well done Vallterry
Can't believe i missed this
Increíble la misión de mercedes! destruir todo lo que se le ponga en frente, dan asco...
Dear Mercedes, your beef with RB got nothing to do with my boy Lando. Next time please tell your driver to aim properly...
Hamilton was on different zone today.10 more laps and he would have passed OCON as well
ABSOLITE GREAT JOB FOR WILLIAMS, 6 POINTS IN THE BAG! AND SEBASTIAN VETTEL, HIS SECOND PODUIM AT ASTON, AND OCON, THE BIG WINNER TODAY, HE IS GOTTA BE PROUD, AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS PROUD? SIR LEWIS HIMSELF AS HE TAKES THE CHAMPIONSHIP LEAD AND MAKES THINGS ALOT MORE INTERESTING!
vALLTERI iTS jAMES
3:02  Can we appreciate the call of the season whoever made this, undercuts 3 cars
What!?!? I just stopped watching the last two races and the championship is already in chaos?!?!  (Silverstone and Hungary)
Esteban Ocon win first Grand Prix with Alpine (Renault).
this has to be the craziest race in modern F1
Mercedes of Hamilton and bottas are painting a target on their back
Tremendous race.
So this is what toto means about 2 dnf away from the championship standings.  Gotta say it’s a big brain master🅱️lan
This race deserves an extended version cause we can’t fit it all in 7 minute.
Russell finally scored a point for Williams!   Latifi: Yeah lol
Bottas holding it down for lewis
Surely Bottas has now secured his seat by taking out BOTH Red Bulls - accomplishment Boss Level 👍🏻👍🏻
Hamilton was playing in 0% A.I
Why did hamilton start alone?
Mercedes need point penality, Perez have 10 place penality for engine change and Mercedes have 5 for next race and last race 10 seconds
Ocon, vettel, Hamilton - 1,2,3 scripted by Fernando alonso...
so are we gonna ignore verstappen overtake a mclaren and a haas and matching the leaders pace using half a car
"Valtteri, it's James. Strat bowl I repeat, strat bowl!"
If still have 3 laps maybe Hamilton can catch estabon
Today what saw what experience does lewis and Fernando gave us hard racing without coming together. At 40 fernando still has it
If not for the many turns, Lewis Hamilton would have passed Alonso  easily
Like i said last day....its gonna be an interesting race today...hahaha... But this is more than that...its fantastics..
I felt so sorry voor lewis at the podium celebrations, im a dutch verstappen fan, but booing him for doing nothing wrong, just gaining loads of positions is just disgusting, he didn’t have a reaction for retaking the championship lead because the crowd was too agressive, felt very bad for him, you could see he didn’t celebrate abd was a little sad because everyone was booing him
I hate that these Mercedes cant drive clean :(
Alpine team principle: Ocon is not Champion material.. Ocan: Hold my 🍺. 👍
The battle between Alonso and Hamilton was epic.
Alonso had Lewis in his pocket there! What a day for Alpine!   And Bottas might have just extended his stay at Merc with that showing on lap 1.
You think Bottas just heard Wii sports bowling music on that first start? Cuz all I heard was *S T R I K E*
It's sad that "the greatest driver of all time" needs things like this to win Edit: talking about hamilton and the championship standings
Hamilton alone on the grid is a perfect description of the 2020 WDC fight
Alonso just proved that with a mercedes he'd be world champion.
every video of race highlights, you see the race result and a pickture of the winner.... and now??? NO... JUST HAMILTON!!! Formula 1... STOP PUTTING MERCEDES ON THE TOP!!!!
wonderful race
Lando got robbed, if Bottas did make that collision,easy podium for lando
Aaaaand Hamilton lucky again what a surprise. 👍🏻
Bottas just did this for the team.. go lewis go i got your back and kick the red bulls out   Nice move really big joke mercedes
I quote... "Ocon might not be world championship material."
Kamikaze Bottas
The whole race was a highlight.
How to take the lead of championship using the Mercedes style: " Be an assh... and crash everyone" What a shame
Hamilton Vs Alonso 🔥🔥🔥
Another installation of not knowing who to cheer for.
Imagine Bottas hitting Lewis instead of Lando And Max.
Back to back races where a Mercedes driver takes out at least one red bull driver....coincidence?
Mercedes must be very proud how they win the championship this year: At Silverstone the take 1 Redbull out, at the Hungaroring they take 2 Redbulls out, what will they do at Monza? Take out Horner and Marko too???
Alonso won it for Ocon. Team sport!
I hope Hamilton thanked Bottas a lot for this today! Even when it wasn't on purpose.
Santa carrera de mi vida ❤️
Man what a race. Heart was racing the whole time Hamilton and Alonso were battling.   Epic viewing.
If Hamilton pitted the medical car would have been leading the race.
If it is accepted that in England it was Hamilton's fault  and he was penalized 10 seconds (didn't matter for the final result of that race) what should we say about Valtteri Bottas, whose mistake took out 3 cars? I'm not accusing him of having deliberately played bowling with his car, but the thought is present.
Vettel in a redbull & Alonso in the mclaren would be a great race
Aston Martin pit stop is so bad!
Bottas before the GP: "Well, I think he soon will be replaced..." Bottas after the GP: "He is the best No2 driver in the history of F1, we give him a new 3 years contract!"
5:55 Carlos could have taken Lewis out like he did Max in Silverstone
Very unlucky Max Verstappen and Red Bull Honda, and Ferrari with Charles Leclerc. It will shineing a better day for them very soon.
another race, another crash caused by a merc lol
Y'all really left out Hamilton's pass on Tsunoda.
Bottas has some rather impressive snooker skills.
Ocon drove perfectly, but without Alonso he would not have won this race. Amazing teamwork!
Fernando is faster than you
Can we just appreciate how perfectly Bottas launched Norris and himself into both Redbulls?
Well played Toto, well played...
Sad to see max on 10th, but the pace Lewis had after that undercut was amazing. Awesome job from Alonso on keeping him back for so long and glad to see Ocon and Vettel on the podium.   Now, conspiracy theories will be great for that  crash.  At the start
Hamilton at the restart : Bottas got a job to took out 2 cars...looks like he took out the whole grid
I just hate British biased commentators, just let Rosberg alone or somebody like him.
So it's confirmed : Vettel is the Gayest driver EVER.
Nico Rosberg did very well as a commentator, I dare say he did even better than Martin Brundle, especially he is not bias against drivers. Showing class where Martin Brundle lacks a lot!!
"So dangerous at this speed man" What a coward.
How about we rename silver arrows into silver bullets ?
How's albon going to explain that first lap incident for redbull to appeal.
Drivers of the day: Alonso and Bottas
Vallteri its james...
Meanwhile at Mercedes after Saturday's Qualifying results ...   Mercedes Worker: ... Hamilton is still 8 points behind Max and we are far behind in the constructors championship  Toto Wolff: (In strong accent voice) We are almost at half the championship. How can we afford to get ahead in drivers and constructors standings?!?!   Toto Wolff:(Punches the table)  Valtteri Bottas: Hold my beer  The next day:
No he did not make,contact with both red bull period.
Remember yesterday how we were joking about Bottas taking his own teammate , well he took one car each from all top 4 teams.
sheesh hamilton again showing the difference between him an the rest of the grid, league of his own tbh.
next level wingman tactics
2:01 George Russell giving the places back because he overtook while the field was cued in the pit lane. Even though he did score points it's looking like he's a waste of talent, a bust, or just straight up unlucky because of his own antics and mistakes. Literally no overtaking in the pit lane. Rookie mistake for him.
Sainz should have made the move first when lapping Ricardio…
valteri the torpedo bottas .
Incredible Race… Wheel to wheel Racing and a galactic Battle between Alonso and Hamilton… a first time winner… this Race had everything what we all wanted to see right ?  And Alonso… this was simply out of this world what he done, this is true Racing and exactly the reason, why i love this Sport… 👍👍👍👍👍
It's not about Hamilton anymore...y'all should just REST!!!
Will someone shut the SHOUTER UP ??
Half a Red Bull still faster than the haas
Bottas the super teammate taking out the competition
Not loud enough
I bet Mercedes at the start of the race didn't expect that kind of a finish.  Even with Redbull's run of  bad luck Mercedes is barely hanging on going into mid season.  Not the standard walk away season Mercedes is used to.
Lewis: *crashes 1 car out at the last race* Bottas: *Hold my beer*
Alonso played the ultimate wingman this race. He knew it was inevitable, but stayed on the defensive to secure a first victory for his teammate. Class act.
Alonso.. what a man, epic!
I never thought Russel getting his first Williams points will be overshadowed by this much
Completely undeserved win. Alonso and Leclerc should have penalties Leclerc turned into Stroll
When Toto said "we are only one dnf away", I did not think he meant every race...
Feel bad for Norris though , streak would've been completed.
Gros travail d’Alonso pour la victoire d’Ocon. Félicitation à Alpine! Par contre Bottas qui tape il fou la merde pour arranger Hamilton devant nan?
Imagine if Hamilton had also gone to pit during the restart, you wont be able to top a racestart without a single car…
So gutted for Lando.
big FU to those who didnt want alonso back 😹
Nice to see Mercedes continuing to torpedo the competition into the barriers
It was my first f1 weekend, and what a great way to start it
This was deliberate!!! Thanks again Mercedes. This has to stop.
Hamilton: Im going to win this! Wallonso: *hold my beer*
lucky Hamilton not win as he come bk very strong on final moments, Williams finally had points 👌🥳💐
Bottas was so focused on getting his contract he didn't gamble with either he bamboozled BOTH BULLS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Everyone’s so afraid of Mercedes knocking them off the track that they all decided to start in the pit
Bottas fighting for the seat his way. Shame.
One of the best races I have ever seen!
Ocon made me shed tears 😭. He's come so far and he deserve this win
Hahaha
I'll be the only one to give Hamilton credit, raced from the back all the way to 3rd... His team have shocking strategies
FROM P14 to P3 on a track where ROSBERG says there is only 1-2 pass zones at max.   Hamilton passed more cars today than the rest of the field combined.
What a day for F1-kind!!
Whatever happens the next 9 years, this will go down as one of the best races in this decade
This is what I would feel like a random grid race would be like. So crazy
Fahrer der Tages Fernando Alonso!!!!
Where's Martin at?
Mercedes: Can't let Max win , Bottas you know what to do.
As much as I like Nico Rosberg I don't like him as a commentator
Hamilton alone at the restart was the funniest stuff ever :D
RUSSELL GOT POINTS?!?!?!!!!
See how hamilton managed his battle with alonso ? that's what max needs to learn if he wants to battle lewis
Ocon was cockon
Race epic☇🔥🔥🔥🔥
Seru banget njeer nyesel gua ga ikut nobar tadi 😭
1:18 one of the best moment i ever see
Im So happy for Seb and Esteban  Well Deserved!
Its all about fan base. Some of alonso's defending move is really dangerous
Bottas crashes both Red Bulls and gives his team mate the points lead? Is this crash gate 2.0? "Valteri this is James. Daniil Kvyat double cowtip"
Seriously is Mercedes current strategy just to take out redbulls??
Hamilton 👎👎👎👎
So Mercedes strategie now is to take both Red Bulls at the start using Bottas. Interesting
How sainz was overtaken so quick shows what Alonso is made of 💪💪💪 🔥

I would give the win to Fernando alonso cuz he hold hamlton off
I'm just here for all the Salty 🧂 comments.
That was racing ladies and gentlemen
I loved this race! So exciting! Maybe reverse grid experiment next season like the new quali format experiment for 2-3 races?
1:21 We race as ONE
An automatic 2 year contract for Bottas
I didn't know Mercedes were a manufacturer of bumper cars. Shocking really
Ladies and Gentleman the great Mercedes Master Plan
It was such an amazing race!! Now we can all head into the summer breaks happy, except for those who lost out in this race XD
What was epic in this race:  -Ocon first win -1 lap crash -hamilton and gasly Amazing comebacks  -williams first points since Germany 2019 -hamilton and Alonso fight like in 2007 -seb on podium again
What a race best one of the season 💯
Valteri it's James, goes full silver arrow, I repeat.. full arrow
Vettel in the 6th-7th best car in the grid this year, has gotten 50% more points than he did last year on the entire season with also arguably the 6th-7th best car. And he has only done 10 races so far. Clearly shows that team environment is important. He was left to dry in 2020...
Can we get this to surpass Baku 2021 highlights of 8M views in a day
Redbull gonna submitted evidence to FIA again 😂
Absolutely brilliant from bottas not quite the best sportsmanshipe but takes out both redbulls and gives lewis the lead of the world championship 😂
Valteri it's James, please take out the Red Bulls
Latifi out paces Russell in the only race Williams scores points
Alonso vs Hamilton 😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩
Now Ricciardo is regretting that move
Alonso : "It's payback time"
Plz say Verstappens bad luck has ran out and Hamiltons bad luck has now began! Congrats to Esteban!
i guess bottas is making himself valuable to mercedes.  kinda like the japanese on pearl harbor
Toto: Bottas plan S; Two Red Bull out, NOW  Bottas: OK
WHEN F1 ARRIBES TO 2040 ALL PEOPLE REMEMBERED ALONSO LEGEND
That's it that's it 🥳🥳✌🥳✌🤣 what a recovery from Lewis. MERCEDES.  THAT'S  how you know who is the better driver and team. With recovery like that you know MERCEDES is the best.
Alonso showing to Hamilton how race a real champ. No powerful car, just hands.
Lewis Hamilton: The only driver who isn't coming to pit lane to change tyres  Lightning McQueen: Wait, I've ever done this before
Mercedes turn 1
Please explain: the F1 highlight of Turn 1 crash has a lady, Sam and some one else talking, and this highlight is the normal announcer. Why the difference?
Toto: -Bottas can you take out both RedBull? Bottas: -I can do it just need some help Bottas: *Norris I chose you* Toto: - I knew I can count on you
Ocon very well deserved Alonso Mega job loved the 2nd time world champion fighting it out there, SEB 😍😍😍 BEST
Incredible theres 11 world championships between those guys on the podium!
still don't understand why Lewis started on inters lol
2:26 Günther swearing at Mazepin! 😂
Almost 6M
One of the most hilariously crazy races I've seen 😂
bottas bowling and sir lancealot jousting
WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING....!!!!!!!?????? talk man, talk.
Thank You Bottas.
Valtteri bostas
Great race for Alpine with Ocon's first victory in F1... and what a sensational drive by Alonso defending himself against Hamilton!
1080p and fixed audio. Let's pretend the first video didn't happ... oh, you already deleted it. Maybe next time don't rush.
these Mercedes race tactics have gone too far xd smh...
Couldn't let people have a 26 minute race video could you for those that Couldn't watch.  Nice real nice
Tray bone, tray biéne.
5 drop positions for for the next race and ONLY 2 points on licence driver for bottas?  FIA it is a joke
0:34 Magnificent move from Bottas. Driver of the day!
ALONSO MASTERCLASS
Fernando  is faster than you
I’m pretty sure that all the drivers apart from Hamilton contravened article 42.11 which says that on a race resumption standing start all the must return to the grid unless they are required to start from the pit lane due to another issue.
DEPOIS QUE A FIA LIBEROU GERAL BATER EM OUTROS CARROS PARA TIRA-LOS DE COMBATE, FICOU DIFÍCIL!
Are we not going to talk about Hamiltons drive from 14th to third?
Bottas the ultimate hitman
The way my heart sank when I thought George had a puncture
How did bites take both red  bull out? He hit lando Norris first
That first corner incident is me when I turn off traction in F1 2021
Standing : Dirvers - Lewis +6, Constructors - Mercedes +10, Enjoy your break Guys, I know who will be having nightmare every night.
Bottas better get a severe penalty for that
Great race by Hamilton to get on the podium. Someone in Mercedes should be demoted for that decision.  I was disappointed that Vettel did not try harder to win as he seemed content to stay back and take 2nd.  Typical F1 team racing strategy I guess...
Lewis saying that the crowd is amazing and they start booing again 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. But  besides that what a GOAT drive from Lewis what a comeback !!!!
toto : add botas to 2022 drivers line up ....
Alonso to Hamilton: YOU SHALL NOT PASS!  Hamilton: Try me
James (Team Radio): "Valtteri, it's James. Well done today! Thank you for that... you are part of the reason why we beat them again today!"
Don't think this time the booing fuelled Hamilton 🤣🤣🤣😆
One of the best F1 races I have ever seen
Everyone is focusing on Bottas, but at the same time I admit that I don't understand what Stroll is doing. Why is he cutting in the grass? He seemed to have time to brake before cutting
Ocon should give his trophy to alonso cos if not for him Lewis would’ve won this at a canter
First time I’ll vote 5 stars on those f1 race polls
I must say, I enjoyed Rosberg's commentary. I'd happily have him do this more often.
Everybody is talking about how Alonso held Lewis with a slower car and slower tires but did y’all forget that it’s extremely hard to overtake in Hungary , we don’t need to look further than the fact that Lewis made basically half of the entire grids overtakes by himself masterful driving by him
Fernando Alonso, the man  who defied AWS overtake prediction
Ocon - 👏🏼  Vettel - 👏🏼  Alonso - 🙌🏼 Hamilton - 🖕🏼
Bottas what a team player 👏🙌👌just a poor team...
5:22 Lewis fighting Alonso: "Wasn't quite Alonside him"
I still believe alonso played an important role by holding Hamilton that’s was also one of the main reason ocon won today. . Happy for both ocon and alonso!
Vettel lost that win in his final pit stop it was awful 3.3 seconds
Bottas: "so whats the plan for the start of the race?" Mercedes pitwall: "You ever play F1 online?" Bottas: "Say no more fam"
1:19 hahaha lewis is lonely on the grid it's fp1 or what?
The day Vallteri got employed
I am so happy for Russel 1st point
Can someone please explain why the race started with HAM Only being on the grid & rest of em pitted ! 🤦🏻‍♂️
Vettel back in the podium is exciting me
I'm loving mercedes strategy. Silverstone: punt off biggest rival, win the race. Hungaroring: have Bottas crash into both RBs through Norris. Go go Mercedes and Hamilton!
Ocon, well done! Alonso, found a second or two for his old rival. Botas, took one for the team. Lewis finally starting to like his team mate
That hamilton and alonso battle was EPIC.
2021 season🔥👌
The best part of this race was Mick’s defensive driving absolutely brilliant learnt from the best! 😉
Lewis was fantastic.
Honestly, Bottas should have a 20-place grid penalty for ruining race of 3 drivers
What a nice teamwork for Mercedes 😀
Toto : bottas ..... Bottas : ok!
This race reminded me why Alonso is my most favorite driver in F1. For a moment, it looked like he was driving the 2006 Renault.
The Alpines really had a solid defence. Ocon defending from Seb and Alonso defending from Hamilton  They deserved the win
This is why I love alpine
Great to see Carlos Sainz become the new strategist on  Ferrari Master🅱️lan
Can I say that Mercedes executed "Interesting tactics" pretty well.
Why would Mercedes ever want to replace Bottas.  He does the best and takes one for the team,when ever its needed. Such loyalty.
Mercedes got their sport mixed-up. They think it's bowling!
This has to be the best race of 2021 season so far !
Bottas going full kamikaze
Bottas is so lame He's got no business being in formula 1.
Hamilton is nothing without Bottas.
Toto: Execute Order 66 Bottas: Copy!
at this point, i think mercedes is not playing fair watch bottas stearing, when taking out those 3 cars.
I have a question to the people who watched from F1TV. Did you had different commentators at the beginning of the race. I had this women, not sure about her name though.
If u wanna win a race do as Merceds cars: crash opponents car.
Wow! Bottas really wants to keep his job.
I didn t notice Vattieri hé hit both Red Bulls  F1 what a pity  Che commedia sens a la Ferrari
Congratulations to Esteban for his maiden F1 victory, well deserved lad, amazing race from Sebastián and  Fernando! Mercedes despite the results in races seem that  falling with drivers and team doing mistakes race after race,meme or not meme this is getting out of control.
After going through a lot of comments, can people just agree that there are only two fast cars and two fast drivers right now, red bull and Mercedes with verstappen and Hamilton.
These where really unforseen events
Bottas is really stepping up in his role as team player.
worst maiden win? i think so most boring race of the season, close so far
The wingman did his best for the Sir of luck
Of course it had to happen. Russell's first points scored while finishing behind Latifi. The guy's cursed even if he wins.
Lewis Hamilton looking at his Mirrors at the restart: Was Valtteri suppose to take out everyone or just the Redbulls?
"interesting tactics" getting more interesting...
Alonso 2022 world champion  MARK MY WORDS !
"It's lights out and away Lewis goes... however"
What a Russian move by Bottas, eliminate every single member of the opposition. One bullet two birds. We used this proverb, bottas proved it. Bottas AKA Jet Lee
Alonso - Hamilton bwoah , happy for Ocon , he deserved a win.
-1. Bottas takes out Red Bulls. 0. Big strategy gamble for Hamilton. 1. Red Bull and Haas fighting for position. 2. Both Williams in the points, with Latifi ahead of Russell. 3. Alonso and Hamilton fighting for position. 4. Ocon wins.
Alonso have earned my respect for been the one the best of the best. He knew that he have to keep ham behind for as long as possible just amazing defense.
This race was weird but great
The commentator confuses emotion with shouting.
Conveniently bottas took out both red bulls? Mmmmm.......
Toto: bottle if you take out both Red Bull’s you have the contract for next year Bottas: challenge accepted
Radio Silence and Hamilton is lost, embarassing
Things I'll remember from this race: turn 1 crash Only Hamilton actually doing a standing start Alonso defending Hamilton Ocon winning the race Williams points! (Thanks Joey)
Not the best car, but Alonso is the best driver out there.
This was just perfect...
Bottas with the triple knockout at the first corner
No memes, no witty jokes, no jabs at anyone, just happy for Ocon.  We love new race winners 🇫🇷 🥇
Nicky got himself an extra big serving of Nutella in the morning xD Nice work Williams!!!
Winner Is Esteban Ocon and leader is now Lewis Hamilton
Get in Ocon and Vettel. ! 🙂
Mercedes serious Masterplan: Bottas taking out everybody who had any real chance of beating Hamilton. Alonso definitely earned being driver of the day, defending Hamilton he showed 20 years of masterclass, what a savvy genius
Ocon's story serves as such an inspiration to so many kids around the world. He lived in a caravan because his parents had to sell their house to fund his career. Now he stands on the podium as a race winner!
Alonsoooo the best 🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🇩🇴🙌🙌🙌 need car
Alonso had the widest car today. He was the real champ at denying Lewis what could've been one of the greatest comeback victory. But all things aside Ocon really held his nerves and acclaimed a brilliant win.
Gladiator stuff from Fernando Alonso
What a race!!! This is F1 people and we love it, we need more of it.
What an absolutely Fantastic Race... Mercedes pace has really come up in the last 2 races.They were almost half a second ahead of Max in qualifying...That's insane to think how much time they have made up...Almost 1 sec.  Congrats to Ocon and Vettel and what a drive from Fernando,and Lewis...Goes to to show that you can race hard without causing accidents.  On the Lewis choice of staying out.I think Mercedes also didnt want to pit him because their pitbox is the 1st box,had they done that Lewis wouldve come out at the back of the field,because they would have had to hold him up until every car went pass...I think maybe that was also their plan
Hamilton gets booed.  Bottas: Hold my 🍺
Alonso masterclass deffence... age is just a number, and F1 is much more entertaining with Alonso on the grid
How Mercedes loses that lamao
Looked like a bunch of amateurs at the start….ffs
What a crazy race...lewis was knackered at the end but great drive... Alonso is fine wine... Russell is awesome
Mercedes really have their ways taking out the championship leader.  Congratulations to Ocon though. Well deserved win!
i definitely want to see "how world reacted" at this start
Team mate of the year award goes to...  Merc is becoming more and more of a joke
And....Where is penalty for  Valtteri ? He causes this incident clearly... he doesnt set his feet on brakes enough. The replay cant be more obvious.  5 cars  damaged for him!
"Bottas took out both Red Bulls cars"... 😂 😂 😂
And no one finds it funny that Bottas takes out both Redbulls.
1:18 its the opposite of the 2005 Indianapolis USGP!!
1:22 The last 7 years Championship story
Hamilton make Hungaroring look like Bahrain With all that overtake
Gigachad energy from Alonso keeping Hamilton back for so long so it wasn't another Mercedes P1
Alonso you devil you.... that was absolutely amazing to watch!
Hamilton looked absolutely exhausted up on the podium. I thought for sure he was going to pass out. That was one heck of a drive battling Alonso. Very entertaining race.....happy for Ocon, Seb, George and Gasly
Alonso to Red Bull for 2022 🔥
Mercedes at it again
Alonso actually saved Seb and Ocon
Bottas should be more careful, he ruined Max and Perez race and Norris ofcourse. Never a top driver with all respect
Is Lewis wins with 25 point at the end of this Year I want to blame the FIA for that one
Crazy crazy race.
Alonso defending from Hamilton is scary to see, I don't know if this Hamilton this aggressive and we never see it. Almost like he want to take him out as well as he peek every gap available.
Comments: 20%: What a race for Ocon 30%: What a race for Williams 50%: Bottas Crash on lap 1
Latifi P8, Russell P9 ??? Latifi should join Mercedes
“Honestly what are we doing? Racing or Ping Pong?” Bottas: try bowling
Bottas with unmatched teamwork
TOTO: if you can do it again next race.. BOTTAS: I’ll have a seat for 2022? TOTO: hmm if you can do it for at least 2 more races..
Like a said, true champion knows how to race without crashing. Swerving around being an aggressor does not equate to championship. Verstappen has a long way to  go.
Great Alonso, stroll must to leave f1
So disappointing ,i expect that Hamilton or Bottas will win that race
Silverstone: Hamilton uses a pit manoeuvre to push Verstappen out of the race. Result:  1) Red flag so his team had enough time to repair his car. 2) 10 Sec time penalty = peanuts 3) Wins and scores max points Hungaroring: Bottas causes various drivers to either DNF or have a badly damaged car. Perez needs a new engine. Result: 1) Hamilton again gains championship points on Verstappen 2) Bottas gets a 5 place penalty for the next race 3) Perez needs a new engine and gets a 10 place penalty for the next race. . Brilliant FIA ruling, unbelievable how they help MB and Hamilton en let all the others get stuffed. Apparently, in F1 crime does pay.
Blewis Fraudmilton
Hamilton must be the luckiest driver these past few races. First knocking out Verstappen (only cost him 10 sec. penalty) and now due to a Bottas mistake both Red Bull's were taken out of the race (Perez completely and Verstappen had to continue with a broken car) Down the line Verstappen will get a grid punishment for using a 4th engine (thanks to the crash caused by Hamilton) So Mercedes did well in the area of taking out the competition. Fair ? I don't believe so.
Feliz cumpleaños Alonso. Feel very happy for Ocon. F..k Mercedes. Most of those idiots commenting forgot about Ocon . Idiots.
Architect of this race is Farnando Alonso
6 cars out on the first lap
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that Gasly got the fastest lap
Bottas trying to secure his Mercedes seat for 2022
Vaitteri,  its Palpatine
Hamilton back again the championship battle lead!!!
Amazing racing so pleased for Esteban 👍
PENALTY points for STROLL and BOTTAS are NECESSARY
Red Bulls are no match for Bottas. He single handedly demolished them, without ever needing Sir Lewis to step in.
so merc strategy is "do not let Verstappen race"
the last two races have brought the old drama back to f1
Why did I have to stay up until 3 am last night? I slept through one of the best races of the season
ocon winning almost put a few tears in my eyes
Alonso won this race...at least in spirit if not for real. Nice to see someone not from Red Bull or Merc win for a change.
Alonso made Hamilton looking like a rook  out here what a defensive masterclass! From the KING
Ocon won the race, but Alonso stole the show.
Well one positive is that we have seen or heard any racial slurs from Verstappen fans the week. I'm proud of them.
tone down the canned crowd next time please
This is the kind of race we want!!!
Hamilton wiped out Max at Silverstone Bottas takes out Max in Hungary Toto to take him out in Spa? 🤣
Fraudmilton crying on the radio not being able to pass an Alpine...priceless
Congrats Ocon..welcome to the podium of legends. Nice job. Nice teamwork too Alonso.
Mercedes great master plan is apparently to *literally* push Red Bull out of the constructors and driver’s championship
Vattael and OCO win because only lucky hahaha
Toto to Bottas, "You idiot I told you take out BOTH Redbull cars !"
Who else is gutted for Vettel to win though?!
The Out of Context Grand Prix
Lewis starting the race alone
Hoy Spain and Hungary highlights are 7 minutes long?
Vettel 3.3 sec pitstop costed his grand prix win
Latifi > Russel Change my mind
Lewis: Initiate Order 66. Bottas: It shall be done my Lord.
Valtteri you fraud!
"At this speed, this is so dangerous man"  That's the inconsistency from Lewis!! He blames someone and at the same time, he did that to someone!!
Valtteri, it's Toto. Execute order 66.
Russell starts crying after he gets his first points for Williams.  *I’m not crying, your crying!* 😭
1:20 *We race as one*
If Hamilton thinks he was booed in Hungary just wait until he gets to the Dutch GP
Great race from Hamilton
Greatest defences in history:  1. Spartan defence vs Persians. 2. Alonso vs Hamilton at Hungaroring.  Take a bow sir!
I was fine with the lenient penalty for Hamilton in the last race, but after this one both Bottas and Mercedes as a team have to hit hard by the punishment. You can't take out your biggest championship opponent two races in a row and shrug it off as a happy little accident. Two race ban for the Bottas car (so no replacement driver either) and put the whole team on probation so that additional infractions this season will lead to point penalties.
Not gonna lie, I'm kinda impressed with Bottas maneuver. One lock up, took out a McLaren, 2 RedBulls, and causing a carnage for the rest of the grid
LETS GO SEBB
This race deserves extended race highlights!
Is Lewis taking notes on how to do wheel to wheel and not send his opponent to the wall? Because he should
One of the best 2 hours of F1 2021 period.
I lost a lot of respect for Ocon when he took out Max in Brazil.  He's got it back in spades now.
To beat Lewis in second half will be mammoth task for Max.... he goes one gear up in second half.
Alonso still in top shape unbelievable
Yay a different winner for once!
Latifi is my driver of the day
It's definitely Godfather theme being played out here.. Bottas is going out there to do some damage ...
INSIDE STORY: Alpine’s Masterclass at the Hungarian GP up next??
Wow ! What a race
Old quote: "hit two birds with one stone" Bottas: "hit two bulls with one McLaren"
Nobody talks about seb
5:43   Why Hamilton have DRS?
mazepin being well, mazepin.
Perfect Teamwork from Mercedes!
toto proud of bottas like all fakemilton fans
was i watching f1 online or the actual race in that first corner lololol
A bowling alley, order 66, the second start with Hamilton and his fans, Alpine Wins, Vettel gets podium and alonso proving what he really is. And more.
Hamilton struggles to pass slower cars (props to Alonso obviously) But like, why are they cheering so much for a dragster to pass a moped?
Team work at its best... Second time in a row.. Great marcedes well done dottas hats off...
Mercedes doing everything to steal Max's title
Congrats on a record eighth world titles, Lewis Hamilton.
How is Mercedes still allowed to cheat time and time again. Sad stuff
Should have included all of Alonso's defending against Lewis. It took several shots for Lewis to pass and I loved every second of it :D
they really make it look like an accident
Mercedes hitting Redbull 2nd race in a row, kind of sus
Toto "Valtteri mission completed"
Alonso holding the Merc back for so long was inspirational to say the least
Muito bom ver Alpine e Aston Martin no pódio.
vettel had run out of fuel at the end of the race, evident of him stopping on the cooldown lap.  Hense him not pushing at the end.
Turn incident was kind of a racing incident imo. Aside from that: Esteban drove amazing, well deserved first win. Great stuff from Seb and Alonso's defensive driving.
Man that Vettel's 3 second pit stop probably cost a possible win for him and Aston Martin
lewis the goat idc
Great Recovery from Hamilton. Well deserved P3.
More takeing out from mercedez...im not surprised at all....but boy did alonzo work some magic keepin lewis at bay for so many laps
Who would have thought both Williams cars would be in the points today. 👏
Turn 1 is much more exciting with Crofty's voice :)
Bottas taking out both Red Bulls = racing incident? That seems a fair call. /s
“should i cry tears of sadness or of joy?” a novel, by me
Congrats congrats ocon
Alonso was the best, he did what he could. The Mercedes team is great again, maybe they need 1-2 race bans! Otherwise, everything will be rough, tactical collisions, braking, etc. they will be in Spa....
davide brivio effect
1:18 this is the craziest moment in F1 history
now all ocon needs is P3 to collect them all
Alonso is a freak of nature when it comes to driving. I believe Senna is the G.O.A.T. still. But cannot ignore how impressive Alonso is with under dog cars.
LUCKMILTON!!!!
What a race !!
Hamilton: The Empire Rest of the Grid: The Rebel Alliance
Alonso is the best driver on the grid
Mercedes
and still there are people that would say they are fans of Merc. Only cause they win.
Alonso "where's ocon?" Team "he won!" Alonso "KARMA"
Alonso is incredibile, 40 years and still humiliating hamilton!
How far will mercedes go to win the championship?
Bottas the "torpedo"
Bravo Esteban et à Alpine F1 Team
Ocon's first win, both Williams got points, another podium for Seb, a lot of DNFs happened, what a time to be alive!
The way Crofty commented when Ocon won the race is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💨
Alonso single handedly kept lewis from winning.. What an amazing race....
When Kamikaze attacks are your only solution to win a GP, it sounds bad for you...
Lol it’s like f1 2021 online
Mercedes conspiracy
Funny how hardly anyone says the amount of crashes or near crashes Verstappen has caused.  Bottas and Hamilton have 1 and the world goes nuts lol
I really wonder where Daniel would've ended up had he not been spun around on Lap 1
Hamilton for sure be getting 2007 flashbacks  😂👍🏻
Hamilton is a very lucky boy. I don’t know why his car is always no damage.
somebody had said that vettel cant be on the podium again this year. LOL in capital letters to that person.
Bottas just secured his seat
1:19 What F1 was about for the last 7 years :D  You know that it is a crazy race, when Mazepin crash but its not his fault :D
Crushed for Max and Lando after their miserable Turn 1, but incredible for Ocon. Nice way to prove the haters wrong.
Man… Drive to Survive will be epic this time!!
Losing interest in F1 Mercedes crash into redbull 2 times in a row and gets championship point for it as reward while destroying there rival car and point scoring opportunities. 5 grid penalty is all the get Mercedes is making this Formula crash your opponent and win 🏆
LETS GO MERCEDES BACK IN THE LEAD
what a race
I know merc isn't doing it deliberately, but this is the second time in a row they run of a redbull, this time even both of them completely taking them out of the race, if this happens a third time fia should really give them a bigger penalty, maybe even a race ban
Toto: Bottas, help me to take out BOTH red bull cars in order to be higher in the CC Bottas: Consider it done 👌
The best race i have ever see
Alonso the Hero!
Alonso moment 🎉
mercedes and reb bull are 1 sec faster and still cant win  !!! GG Ocon ! well deserved.
BottASS did his job nicely!
What if Max had switched to dry tires during the red flag period
Givee Hamilton's luck and throw me in the middle of the ocean... even with his best car the luck still beside him 😅
When will Lewis's luck run out bro, I'm tired of him, great job for Ocon and Alonso, brilliant driving!
All of the Alonzo rookie comments 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️ I think it’s a joke but wow
Toto: Ok Valteri take out the Red Bulls for a chance of contract for next season Bottas: Bu... Toto: Do as I say or your fired
You gotta accept one thing. This was a hilarious but great race. It was Mercedes responsible for giving us boring races before. its Mercedes now giving us hilarious races.
Seb vs Ocon with only 1s gap whole race was amazing to watch 🔥🔥
alonso holding up hamilton allowing his teammate ocon to win after the race started with bottas taking out 1/4 of the field in turn 1. you can't write it any better
I feel so bad for Lando. Incredible start and gets punished for it.
what's up with Mercs taking the competition out in 1st lap
Lewis is just insane! really happy for Ocon though.
What a race!! Nice to see everything mixed up for once just because of a little rain 👏🏻👏🏻
What a race this was
So Mercedes is just taking out the competition now?
the commenter is so bais saying " valltri took out both red bulls"
BTW, my favorite color is white....
Alonso is a monster...made his team-mate win by stopping hammertime in an inferior car AND slower tires
2020: 1:23
Mercedes to Ferrari: That's how you do a Master🅱️lan
Well done ocon.
Can't wait for 2022 when the cars are a little more equivalent, we'll be seeing so much exciting racing!
Mercedes: If you cant beat them, knock them out
Valtteri Bowling...
"To whom it may concern, f*** me" Valtteri Bottas
Crashstappen almost took out Ralf Shumacher with the same move he did in Silverstone
Vettel podium Russell scores points Ocon wins Fernando great bday weekend  Everyone liked that 👍
2:45 that is all
Hope Max can bounces back, been very unlucky in the last two races...
Yummy crashtappen tears 😭
THIS is the reason I don't bother watching the race in real time or for that matter taking much of an interest anymore. Officials don't penalize the other team when one member takes out the competition. This is pure BS and tiresome. Done with F1.
Verstappen fans take another L. and I am very happy about it....Toxic fans.
That Alonso and Hamilton Fight 🔥💯🔥👏👏👌
The Mercedes crew are such clowns. Max fan here btw
Esteban 🔥 Any Russians here? 🤪
Alonso is pretty much the key to ocon victory, so proud
I heard Nico Rosberg)
Simply Wow. Brillant race
Some rotten luck for RedBull these last 2 races.. What a race tho
Hamilton 😯😴😎👏👏👏👍
Big win for Williams!!
A Verstappen wheel-to-wheel with a Schumacher? Now that's a nostalgic feeling
whats the point of the safety car at the restart lol
Most comments are talking about Alonso defense against Lewis, but no one is talking about the fact that Lewis actually overtook him, and thatvhe came from 14th place to get to the podium...
That rookie Alonso surely has a great career ahead of him.
That's the only way Mercedes could win , wreck the competition intentionally just like the overate Hammy!
I love to hear the sound of the 5 red light to start
Was Hamilton allowed to open his Drs when he was already passed Saintz?
Let’s goooooooooooo Russel
Wow, a young driver like Fernando held off a vastly more experienced Lewis for that many laps.
Will Bottas be with Mercedes in 2022? Bottas: For Family * plays bowling with cars * Toto: Welcome back
Drive to survive is gonna be such a banger this year my gosh 😅
Everyone is attacking red bull .i hate how everyone is crashing them out of the races so mercedes can win this years championship.
Bottas only getting a 5 grid penalty is a joke. Should've been a 10 grid penalty considering he took out/damaged both cars from the championship contender team.
Mercedes made one of the biggest strategy mistakes I have ever seen by not pitting Hamilton at the beginning. I could not believe it
Looks like Bottas really is there to support Hamilton 🤣
What will happen after the summerbreak? Mercedes taking out Albon in the Simulator too or what?
Yes Esteban race win and Bottas *****
Mercedes should be penalize for causing 2 accidents in a rows causing the leader of the competition to lose place.
Alonso single handedly humiliated Lewis there, that was perhaps the first time in a long time we've seen just how quickly Lewis cracks under pressure and gets frustrated whenever he doesn't have a 1 second per lap PU advantage.
Why is nobody talking about the fact. that if Vettel's pitstop wasn't a 3.3 but a 2.3 like Icons, he would be in front of Ocon and could have won the race?
Mercedes with great strategy, tell Bottas to crash into main title rivals and then use some smokescreen race strategy to make it seem like it wasn't intentional.
Ocon win Sainz challeging Ferrari Gasly demolishing Tsunoda Williams on points Alonso GOAT defending 5 cars out  Best GP of the year by far!
Bottas thought this was bowling and he was the ball
Alonso, WOW. That was the widest F1 car in history. Brilliant drive.
0:48 uh dr. Seuss?
Alonso held Lewis for a solid 10 laps, ultimately gave the win to his teammate, top driver!
The tears of Max's fanboys' never tasted so sweet
Technically Alonso obviously couldn't hold off Alonso on the medium tyre, but I'm not surprised he was able to hold off Hamilton because he's one of the best
"Valtteri, it's James...Lewis took out Verstappen last race...so..."
Ocon win, and Williams double points? WHAT IS THIS RACE?!?!?!?
There were too many battles to cover for one highlights video
This Mercedes crashing out Red Bull Cars is getting out of control now!
Bottas - what should i do to renew my contract?  Toto - Starts a crash
🅱️i🅱️lical scenes
Lo mejor de la carrera ha sido la lucha entre Alonso y Hamilton y solo lo ponen 1 vez, increíble 🤦🏻‍♂️
Thank you Alonzo for demonstrating that Lewis is not nearly as talented as he thinks he is ! BIG CONGRATS to Esteban Ocon !
Welcome back Alonso
Another Mercedes Master🅱️lan
WILLIAMS FINALLY GOT POINT!😲
Vettel and pitstops. Name a worse duo.
Nico: " bottas took out both redbull cars."
What I thought the race would be: Boring  What happened: 🅱️I🅱️lical scenes
1:18 Indy 2005 flashbacks xD
0:31 im sorry but thats hilarious Two birds with one stone
Mercedes should be banned for 1 race. Hamilton struggled to get past a 40 year old alonso and he expects to beat verstapen. No wonder another Mercedes driver took out verstapen and they will only get a 5 place grid penalty for the next race.
In other news, this is Vettel's second podium for the year
Bottas is a disaster!
How Is Alsono holding Hamiltion? is easy, sky completlely bought and biased commentator, Is called skill
Lewis : I am the Merc no 1 driver. I took 1 driver out last race Bottas : Hold my brakes
Toto : You want that seat you, need to compete and start beating Lewis.    Bottas : I can do that.    Tota : Great job.
Everyone talking about Bottas’ crash and his future, meanwhile I’m here looking at Ocon’s win and Vettel’s podium and Hamilton’s recovery and Alonso’s great drive!
That was completely bottas fault slammed into lando sending him into the red bull     This comment was written by a lando fan
I don't know why Ferrari changed Vettel for Saenz
watching alonso drive is just🤌🏻
6:42 must feel so amazing to win your first grand prix and drive side by side with your Team Mate Fernando Alonso
Valtteri it's James we need you to sacrifice your race and take out red bull
Alonso defended from Hamilton for 10 laps and they only show 1...
1.29 mdrr 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Whenever the race is expected to get boring, we know Alonso is about to turn the tables.
u can see how bottas did what h e didd he shuffed two red bulls and one mclarenoff mate ..ON purpuse   again lmercedes suk at playi fair .u can literlie see how bottas aimned at norris and went through
🤣
All jokes aside watching this race was so frustating I swear Bottas just wants to be demoted to williams, mercedes hurry up and give Russel that deserving seat.
Don’t forget, at one point it looked like Williams could’ve gotten two podiums…
How was ricardo soo far behind annoys me so much!!!!
Most emotional and high adrenaline seeking race of 2021
Botas has the best strategy to put both red bull out.
The only way Mercedes are winning right now is because Max isn’t there. Interesting tactics
Everyone: 40y old wc blocks 36y old wc      Me: HAM get 3rd from LAST place!
Latifi: is in the points Also Latifi: *What is this place*
No doubt. Bottas is the best wingman
no one noticed hamilton was too weak to spray the champagne and raise the trophy...that is what the fastest car does to you when you push 100% from start to finish...i know you will say everyone was pushing but at some point everyone was maintaining a constant tire saving pace but not hamilton
What's going on with Bottas driving in the rain? Last time was it Turkey where he spun 6 times?
Lewis : Valtteri you should be more of a team player from now on Bottas : *takes out 3 cars including 2 Red Bulls*
checo unlucky ;(((
Go Alonso 😎
WHAT A WINGMAN!!🤘🤘🤘 and Ocon fantastic. getin there!!!
why bottas is still a mercedes driver and stroll a f1 driver?
Ring ding ding for Esteban!
This shows the unpredictability of f1 race,you can never predict the outcome of a race.
No matter who you support, you have to admit, this was an amazing race
Hate him as much as you want, Hamilton's recovery race was a masterclass today
Alonso really said "You shall not pass" at the end of the race. What a win for Ocon and the whole team with both drivers contributing massively
Like a football match with match fixing
Just shows how much inherently better Lewis’ car is than everyone else
No one talking about how max managed a point finish with a damaged taped up car?? Alright then
Bottas took out both red bull cars! Bottas: Mission Accomplished.
Again somehow Mercedes manage to benefit from a crash.
‘Formula 1 racing is like war planning’ - Toto Wolff. He wasn’t joking.
Bottas has secured his seat
Seeing Hamilton alone on the grid at the restart had me laughing so hard
Mercedes new strategy to just take out red bull the first chance they get every race is really paying off
At this point it's only fair if Perez starts aiming for Hamilton.
The last time a rookie won his maiden race, the hungarian grandprix with renault, he went on to become a 2 time world champion🏁
Here for the Red Bull and Verstappen tears. 😂😂😂
Honestly speaking, Lewis is a great driver
INCREDIBLE race 🇫🇷🤝🇭🇺
This is intenst!!!
All podium finishers deserved it.          Maybe Alonso P3 would have been great.
The job did an amazing guys !
1:20.  I think that I have never seen a restart like this with only one driver.
people jokes about Bottas "causing" crash in Silverstone between hamilton and Verstapen. well now you can blame Bottas :) lol.
This is the F1 we all want to see. Congrats to Ocon. Alonso back to the golden years. Hamilton from P14 to P3. Vettel superb drive. Max coming together with another car (again). This time Schumacher Jr. Even Tsunoda got P7, a real triumph for him. Best GP so far this season.
Merc strat for the season :- DEMOLITION DERBY
'Lewis from 14th to 3rd' What about 1st to 14th
From out of a seat in 2019 to race winner amazing
Such an eventful race that the highlights don’t even mention a *does doubletake* double points finish for Williams with Latifi ahead of Russell?!
Is Bottas trying to secure his seat for '22 by helping the team in any way he can?
The commentary voice is so bad
Unlucky max
Mercedes: we can still win this lewis. 2 seconds faster than anyone.  *Fernando alonso has entered to the chat*
So happy for Ocon. Last year Gasly, now him. He deserves it !
best race of 2021 so far
Rainmaster Seb ❤️ and Alonso with that Brilliant drive ! 3 Legends of F1 competing against each other after so long (HAM, VET, ALONSO)
Alonso showed who's the boss is
Schumacher challenging verstappen was a highlight for me haha casually taking on a red bull with a haas
WALLONSO
Interesting tactics
Well, at least we cannot say that Bottas is useless anymore... 5 place penalty is a joke!! you're riddiculous  maFIA!!!
Verstappen nearly crashes into Schumacher.
This race right here proves that Hamilton is one of the the best drivers of all time, amazing skill. He deserves to be the champion after this one.
Lewis at the restart is like: *Where is everybody*
If it wasn't for Alonso behind the wheel of the Renault, then Hamilton could easily and on paper pass him but I don't think he was lucky, maybe Hamilton forgot who he was up against in the final round.
We should all salute Alonso today. His duel with Hamilton was easily the highlight of the race. Two of the greats battling like that was epic!. I have been rather dismissive of this older Alonso. I take it all back. His defending almost certainly allowed Ocon to win the race. He made a mistake in the end but most of these young "talented" drivers would have cracked much quicker with  Hamilton bearing down on them.
verstappen ramming people again, dude needs to check himself
When was Bottas planning to break?…. This was a planned move!!
How to keep the Mercedes seat  Everyone: Score points, gets on the pudium, defend for Lewis... Bottas: Crashing in turn 1
MY DRIVER OF THE DAY IS DEFINITELY BOTTAS , HE OUT DID HIMSELF THERE AND TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM AND HE MIGHT HAVE SECURED THAT 2022 SEAT
Hat of to ocon , from nowhere to his first F1 GRAND PRIX WIN
Lets all take a moment to appreciate vettel having a much mo better season than last year with ferrari, he really is proving his worth
the one race i didn’t watch.
Never thought I'd get to see Ocon grabbed his first win! massive work from Ocon and Alonso being a roadblock for Lewis fkn paid off.
Mercs strategy, back to back crash
Get Alonso in a top car!!! He'll win another world championship
Bottas did his job.... He took everyone in contention out. No wonder the racist said he was the best teammate.
One driver standing start, bottas chaotic crash
Valteri Bottas driver of the day. He took out the two red bulls in one coner. Thats what i call precision
A very strong result considering what his team ceo said  "I dont think he is world championship material"
1:19 When you show up for class, but it turns out to be a holiday.
Lewis: He's gaining, tell Bottas to throw.
Thank you 😊
Valtteri.. It's James : Don't brake in the Turn 1 please 😎 I repeat don't brake in the Turn 1 ! - Copy James !   After 5 min: Valtteri.. It's James : The 2022 contract is waiting for you in my office 😎
Congratulations to Alpine, Alpha Tauri and especially Williams! Crazy to think those three teams all got double points finishes!
Mercedes de Merd
Que piloto Alonso....madonna mia Bravissimo.....
Unfortunately, this doesn't do Alonso's defense justice at all!
such a great race to end this year's first half of the season!!
I think erricson hit us...
Disgusting
Russel scoring points in Williams??? WoW!!!!Finally And top of it...Latifi ahead of George..
What a joke of a start. Bottas needs a race ban for that.
Nico Rosberg all the race: Lewis, Lewis is, Lewis has, Lewis my love.
Thanx for antother iconic race formula 1. Congratulations for Ocon.  The only thing i dont understand is the maximum penalty for Giovinazzi, who simply destroyed his race. For what? Speeding in the pit lane?  For me as a fan is the message, that pit lane speeding is the greater crime than pushed another driver out at high speed.  ?????
LATIFIIIIIII YEEEEEE
BRAVO VETTEL! SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU ON THE PODIUM.
Craziest race everrrr
I hate Mercedes 🤬
Can we just take a moment and think about the fact Bottas and Stroll combined took out the 6 cars that were favourites for a win and Hamilton didn't win
I believe that it is safe to say that merc and hamilton couldn't be more hated. Really low class reaction when the went down in the championship. Then its this guy Alonso man.. what a treasure! I think every neutral fan is with verstappen at this point.
What a race!!!!!!!!!!!!
1:20 when everyone in the game has disconnected
schumacher needs to realize what car hes in. almost took max out in the slowest car. get in your lane kid
Should Mercedes keep on to Bottas. He might have won them the drivers championship?!
Mercs have very different way of dealing with competition
wait for a moment I felt like it was some kind of F1 Sim racing out of PS4 when i dont listen to the teeeeam radio.
Incredible race today! Well deserved victory!  What an amazing podium! 🏆🥇🏁
It amazes me that both Williams scored, but what amazes me more is that Latifi has more points than Russell now
The best Grand Prix of the 2021 Formula One World Championship season!
Just wondering how the haters are gonna say this was all Hamiltons fault.
f1 2021 my team mode after season 1 xd
Rossi should eat his words
The amount of salt here is amazing
WHAT A RACE!!!
Mercedes master 🅱️lan
Superb drive from Ocon, but massive drive from Alonso who done enough to keep Hamilton outpace him.
2021 Hungarian GP = Monza 2020 on steroids
Waiting for "If 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix was a meme"
Confirmed: Red Bull revealing their bulletproof tank-car in three weeks.
and to think that I was not expecting much for this weekend
Valtteri 神風. Interesting tactics.
Toto to Valtteri Toto: Valterri, the time has come, execute order 66. Valterri: It will be done, my lord.
Alonso really saved his teammate by holding up lewis for as long as he did.  Really strong defending from alonso.  He's still got it.
Mazepin gasly and Perez should wreck Mercedes every chance they get from here on out. These last two weeks have been criminal
A driver of bottas’s calibre shouldn’t have made that mistake
News: "Bottas signed by Mercedes for next 10 years after his stellar performance in Hungary"
Bottas trying to match Lewis in the only way he can, by taking out more cars than Lewis last weekend.
Pretty sure a race ban would benefit Mercedes more than a 5 place grid penalty.  They are banning Bottas not banning Mercedes from getting 2 cars on the grid. Mercedes can get Rusell in the other car without any grid penalty and still can score points for the constructors' championship.  Really don't understand why so many Red Bull fans want a race ban lol
The last time Enstone's F1 team won a GP was the Australian GP in the 2013 season.  So it’s the same team as the current Alpine.  Enstone’s team had many names in F1 history;  Toleman, Benetton, Renault, Lotus and Alpine￼
Imagine Lewis messing with the magic button while alone on the grid
UN. BE. LIEVEABLE!!
This sport is a joke. 2 races in a row Mercedes have crashed their way to the points lead
When you have used "eliminate your rival by pushing him out of track" card but you have an excellent teammate for the job...
Wow some people just can't stop themselves from blaming Hamilton for everything. He had a wonderful race gotta give to him for finishing in P3 despite being at the very last at one point.  If it wasn't for Alonso, Hamilton would've won easily today he was just couple of seconds behind the race leader which is incredible considering the fact that how messy this race was.
Ham *leads*, Merc *leads*, vest et al broods and boos :D
0:37 F1: Toto, this is getting to be a habit.
Alonso & Lewis were the best thing in this race. That’s how champions fight for a position. I think some of you know what a mean. Go Lewis.
bottas strike feels artificial
Success comes with a lot of haters, doesn’t it ? Crazy how much envy people can have
Epic race, shame this channel spoilt the result by uploading a 40 second video of the winner first! 😠😠😠
Well.. Thats a way to secure a Merc seat i guess
Sculohamilton
I don't understand how people don't like Alonso
Finally Bottas makes his job
“Oohhh, and Valtteri took out both Red Bull’s” ~ Nice Rosberg
Apparently, Bottas started watching Daniil Kvyat's Guide to Torpedoing, all 3 volumes too
I guess that is one way to make sure VER doesn't take out HAM.  Just have the 2nd car blast the other team out of commission.  AMG is turning F1 into bumper cars at Cedar Point.  Thanks, AMG.  You just proved yourself a bunch of punks.
Master plan from merc. Take out rd on lap 1
Bottas should remain in Mercedes, he helped Hamilton so much today.
Aston Martin and Vettel gave away an easy win… 😢
Crofty is becoming insufferable
Tbh Ocon has showed more potential then Russell considering his career i understand that Williams is quite slow but still..
Bottas just opened himself the possibility of a new career - BOWLING - the dude is a MASTER at taking out specific pins. He literally swiped 3/4 (sans Leclerc) probable contenders for Hamilton. What an MVP.  So after he loses the Merc seat, off to bowling, he has a fabulous career waiting for him there.
Toto: Bottas, you still want to be on the team right? Bottas: say no more
alonso did a great job to stop lewis
well played maclaren...when you can't out run them...just crash on them
Petition to launch an investigation against Toto Wolff, Valterri Bottas and Michael Masi for fixing races
Boycott F1 and maFIA
I think we should say that Hamilton caused these crashes f**** max fans
I couldn't stop laughing when Hamilton had his lonesome restart🤣🤣🤣🤣
Crofty needs to stop screaming like a banshee, it’s ridiculous.
not so much a second driver now Ocon :)
1:24 is gonna be an image for eternity
Fernando, the best
Alonso drained Hamilton out even in two different kind of cars...respect for both...
Hamilton being handed the championship once again, Mercedes getting their money's worth from Bottas his contract. What a shitshow.
Valtteri Bottas has just been signed by the International Bowling Federation!
This was AMAZING, lets goooooooooooo
(Second comment). This is something I feel needs mentioning. There should be a rule where you can't pit before a race restart unless it means restarting the race on slicks on a track that's getting wetter. This is to stop the carnage of loads of drivers pitting at once because Mazepin got taken out in the pitlane and the incident could have hurt people.
I literally Predicted Vettel to get a podium
I love to see Red Bull  fans cry. It is my daily medicine, my weekly energy, my monthly inspiration and my annual motivation. Their loss is the only reason I am still alive, I was born to love and enjoy the failure they have achieved.
What was that random immage thingy at 3:19
i just feel sad about Max, he deserves better luck
Alonso hold tha fool off
Start: *exists*  Bottas: *IT'S PORRIDGE TIME*
So for the second race running Mercedes took out red bull via crashing into them. Nope nothing foul or sus here
Gasly 🤝 Ocon Frenchmen winning a chaotic GP
Latifi has more career points than Russell as a Williams driver
Its vive la france
Talking about Bottas being a great wingman look at Alonso
How to win a World Championship for Hamilton? Mercedes: "Crash out all other cars !" Bottas: "Copy, James." Merecedes: "Great Job. Contract offered !"
multi bowling 21
"Alonso won Esteban the race"  The nerve of some fans. Still not giving Esteban any of the credit even when he won the race
Why did Verstappen not get any more places back?
Bottas took team work too another new levl
Stroll was clulles grass in the rain is not move easily avoidable
Man isn't Crofty just a master at his craft? 🎙
Fernando Alonso, what a promising young talent....
Regardless of whether it's purposeful or not, it's FACT that MAX's Leadership went down for two hits in two consecutive races. There's nothing to say, he was only harmed without doing anything. If it's to continue these beats in the RBR and better deliver the title soon to HAMILTON like 2018.
Bottas your mission...take out the Red Bulls. Bottas: Roger that!.
I wanted vettel to win but really happy for ocon.
F1 rules are completely ridiculous. The penalty for doing something like Bottas did today has to be much higher. Maybe even excluding both cars from that team from the race (since there is such a thing as the teams' championship). What a joke!
it looks like they are deliberately taking out redbull's
What a race such unexpected things happens in this race!
Hamilton perfect 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏁😎🎉🎊
Alonso truly deserving of that DoTD win. What a masterclass in defending.
The 2021 season will be one of the best seasons, full of suprises.
Williams💪💙
Bottas probably did it on purpose, he's doing anything to keep his seat at Mercedes
This race was a emotional rollercoaster, we need more races like these
what a brilliant race gotta give it to alsonso's defence and a great drive from lewis , vettel and ocon
Bottas really been trying to prove he's a valuable second driver lately. Toto likes what he sees.
Thank you, Bottas for your sacrifice for this amazing race.
Everyone’s happy when an outsider wins a F1 Grand Prix
I’m convinced Hamilton just started on his own for the memes
Alonso 🎉🎊🏁🏆
Toto: Wanna drive for us next year? Bot: ...
Alonso's defense againts hamilton for a few laps ia a worthy of a highlights full video, a mastery of defending against a faster car, he still has it in him
Botas did a solid for Lewis. Imagine the outcry if Lewis did what Botas did. This world is unfair.
botass is terrible and lulu is a cry baby
Unfortunatelly Lewis didnt have Bottas to Crash into Alonso
Hamilton: is dangerous at that speed Max:😐
0:12 Yo, Bottas crashed Lando, throwing him at the first redbull and taking out the seacond with his car...this man is on Maldonado level
DRIVER OF THE DAY  Fernando  Alonso  , Driver For The Team Valtteri Bottas
Wow ! What a race to end with before the summer break, drama all the way through. Great to see my team Alpine coming together for some great racing today, CONGRATS Ocon on that win and awesome to see Alonso holding Ham back 👊👊💥💥
You should not be penalized for an engine replacement after being crashed into: Change my mind
Interesting tactics
Commentators still trying to make the restart as exciting as possible 😂. That was hilarious.
Bottas be like: Hippity hoppity your mclarens now my property
There is no negative think to say about Alpine drivers today, finally :)
if at first you can't overtake your rival, plough him off the track and into the barrier
I am going to start calling Alonso Gandalf.
Vettel 🎉🎊🏁🏆
Take a bow. Fernando Alonso 🔥🔥👑
“Valterri, it’s james. Execute order 66”
1:20 WE RACE AS ONE
Time traveler steps on a bug 2021👀: Hungary GP chaos
"Très bon, très bien et formidable !"
Lewis being the only car to start off the grid is one of the most hilarious scenes
I don’t understand !?? Why stuarts  let all cars after  Hamilton after the crash!?!  🧐  If they let him alone he would have won!
Broo this season🔥🔥
2.45 Und wieder typisch Verstappen. Zieht in Schumacher rein als wenn er nicht da wäre...
TOTO: Valteri, Max wants to hit Lewis, protect him !!!!  Valteri: NOOO Toto, I also have to take care of my championship.:):)
Lando Noris in F1's third season: The main thing about him this season is that apart from trying as much as possible to overtake the car in front of him before entering T1, he also always tries to play it safe at the start, especially during the first laps, which is often a crash because all the cars are still crowded. With that way plus McLaren's improved performance this season, he's always consistently got points with three podiums. Average at P3 - P5, once at P8. This time, even though from P6 he managed to place P3 before T1, all these attempts were destroyed by another racer who hit him from behind even if it wasn't on purpose.
Unfair race
''Cars should not be fixed under red flag''
Ocon 🎉🎊🏁🏆
0:32 - when your PS5 controller disconnects cuz low battery🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ 0:40 - potato driver 😌 1:20 - drive to survive 😂 4:29 - real hero Fernando Alonso 💪💪
Lewis is gonna win this championship let's gooo
Valterri , it’s James, take out both redbull
Hamilton: I am the legend  Alonso: Hold my bear
Most craziest start US GP 2005      Now: Hungary GP 2021
Alonso and Pierre were the immovable objects and Lewis was the unstoppable force. Alonso especially has been the hardest driver to overtake this season
at least now, we can all be confident that Hamilton wins championships with PURE unadulterated skills.
Mercedes just ramming their opponents off the track and getting away with it, Perez getting a 2 TIMES WORSE PENALTY for having to change his engine after the crash caused by Bottas, F1 HAS BECOME A FARCE, **** THIS BS!!!
☺☺😅
See yay max lewis wins the title this year
ocon better thank alonso with some nice drinks
and hamilton nearly died on the podeum
Can someone let me know why the commentaries differs from the one on F1TV ??
Lewis Hamilton took: "We race as one" too seriously.
Bottas for driver of the day. 🎣
It's been tough being a Red Bull fan since the last 2 races, believe me
Toto: well done Valtteri
Alonzo gave the best fight to Lewis! While Sainz  gave up too easily🤐
It was mercedes strategy to take out both red bulls.
F1 should stop now
Best rookie of this year vs 7 times world champion
Mercedes is such a shame this year, i really hope they don't win either championships
How bottas Secured his Mercedes Seat
3:56 Kym Illman spotted
Alonso held off yet another 7-time world champion, this time for a teammate. Looks like it took out so much from Hamilton too. Lewis seemed livid and exhausted. He could not even lift the champagne bottle to celebrate. Great race! Congratulations to Esteban and Alpine, and to Nick, George, and Williams!
This is the race that will decide the second seat for Mercedes
Valtteri it's James we said only take out Max not everybody
I don't understand what Mercedes did with Hamilton. Why don't they stop Hamilton as everybody ?
1:18 Sachsenring MotoGP 2014 intensifies, many rider/driver start on pitlane
Ocon should thanks Alonso for holding Lewis
"OCON is a grand prix winner"  Finally mate
Can we appreciate Hamilton’s greatness? He made this entertaining. There was no overtaking besides him and Max.
_Hamilton stays out_ My brain: YOU NEED TIRES, YOU IDIOT!
Who else thought we may have Vettel Alonso Hamilton on the podium ... reminding us old days
Fernando Alonso simply the best of the race. Magic Alonso is back !!! G.O.A.T👍👍👍.
Alonso is just an absolute chad, manage to hold on ham so ocon could get his win, hats off to *GIGALONSO*
Ocon showing he can hold a lead may have opened some eyes
Whats next mercedes?🧐🧐
Toto: Valteri, we need maximum points to ....... Valteri: Say no more...
This is racing!!!
Can we just kick bottas out of that car and put russle in it
Screaming commentary is ridiculous and detracts from the viewing. Unfortunately that is the norm with today’s commentators.
Merz at the restart be like Don't worry hamilton we will do everything to get you close to Max
Thanks to Bottas and Mercedes we had an amazing race.
Mercedes have seen the way to victory. The destruction derby way.
Ok why don’t I understand how Lewis went from race leader, to race sole restarter, to back of the pack 😳
WHAT A GRAND PRIX! Absolutely AMAZING!
First to last , last to 3rd epic comeback
Weirdest race in 2021
Bottas: KACHIGGA KACHIGGA KACHI KACHI KACHIGGA
Alanso's defence was great. Carlos gave up  Ocon won  Best race
Bottas: What do I have to do to keep my seat for 2022 Toto: you see those two Redbulls?  Bottas: Say no more
imagine just tuning in abit late to the race and seeing just Hamilton there at the start line...
pecah bat pecah
LATIFI USED THE TANK. I repeat, he used the tank
Alonso, you are my hero
I'm no Verstappen fan but at least Hamilton didn't win.
what a crazy race congrats to the top 3 congrats to ocon ! i am a Lewis fan
The best laps of the race Alonso holding Hamilton
For some reason i dont like hamilton
Alonso still have all his cylinders firing beautifully....what if he was driving a car as fast as the Mercedes...it was brilliant watching him
Best race so far thats for sure
Hamilton starting the race with equally matched cars on the grid 😂
Bien joué à notre Ocon nationale 👍🎉🎉🎉
2 birds 1 stone
Have a feeling Russell is going to be in that Mercedes after the summer break
Max scoring a point with half a car👏👏👏👏
Things you love to see. First win for Esteban Ocon and first win for that beautiful alpine
I was listening to the race on the radio in the car and when i heard mazepin crashed in the pit i thought hed done a grosjean but it turns out the alfa romeo pit crew just dont know what theyre doing
1:18 Hamilton was wondering, geez, did Bottas really take out everyone?
so happy for ocon and alonso. both were defending seb and lewis really well! both deserved their positions today!  congrats to seb and lewis on the podium too!! 🤍
Full respect for Alonso. And Ocon. Best teammates on the grid this year
1:19 Lewis with his friends
He should bring shameful & more!!!
-ocon wins -both williams on points What more do we need?
Toto: hit him.. Bottas: copy that After finish Ham: thanks dude :v
Lolol sky were using fake cheers for Hamilton overtakes like the WWE do it. Go back and watch it’s clearly looped cheer audio
I think mercedes is getting desperate now. First hamilton and verstappen, now bottas in the move of getting rid of their rivals. Lol
Alonso should be driver of the day because he definitely got Ocon that win. Then again I bet Vettle would have been probably just as hard to pass.
Toto: Listen up Valtteri, you need to pretend to make poor start, then pretend to brake to late and then accidentally take out Verstappen Bottas: Aye aye sir Toto: Crashing cars go brrr hehe Bottas: sits proud on tyre barrier
Mercedes team : hammer time Lewis : hammer time Alanso : f  off
Bottas is gonna get a generous bonus from Toto in his bank account real soon
Alonso el piloto del dia....
BS Lewis!!!!!
Mate, I'm so happy for Vettel and Ocon. Incredible Job by Alonso holding up Lewis behind!
Lewis - Last time, i took Max out of the race.  Valtteri - My turn
great job Ocon!
Congrats on Bottas for securing that Mercedes second seat for 2022. Bravo!
Bottas going for that special bonus paycheck 🤣😂
Let’s all take a moment to appreciate how Nicholas Latifi finished a head of George Russell both of them in the points. Noice
So happy for Esteban
TOTO: 123, CHAMPIONSHIP! Hamilton: 123, TEAMWOK! Bottas: 123,YOU GOT IT!
Congratulations to Ocon and Seb!  Once again Bottas gave the Red Carpet to the Drama crying queen Hamilton.  Thanks Bottas for destroying the race to 6 drivers!
We need you bottas to help Hamilton win today. BOTTAS:No problem guys.
The only way that Mercedes is back in the title fight is by taking the Red Bulls out of the race… as seen on the past 2 races. Disgusting.
Very impressed with Alonso and Latifi. Sad for Max :/
Honestly, this video doesn't do Alonso's defense against Hamilton justice at all. The way he kept Hamilton behind for several laps was astonishing.
Crazy that people thing Botas did that on purpose. Even if he wanted to it would be so hard to rear end one car, knocking it into one red bull while keeping his car under control with no steering or front wing to take out the other. He was able to do that he would be champion already. :P
What a race!!!!! Awesome job by Max to salvage something after being roughed up again. Always great to see a first time winner, couldn't have asked for a better race.
OCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON. 🥳🥳🎉🎉🎊🎊🍾🍾🇫🇷🇫🇷
I thought silly season ended 2020. We are getting a sequel
what a joke only 5 grids penalty for this
Bottas:I am speed
Bottas did the Karate kid play but in F1
Se cumplió mi sueño, ver a Williams puntuar
Alonso hero of the day🤌🤌
Rosberg said what?.., didn't hear him well on Lewis's win😀
All I want to know is how would the race have been restarted if Lewis had also pitted??
Again Bottas, who is always complaining about other drivers...grande Alonzo!!!
Lewis is such a lucky driver. He just got handed the championship lead in the last two races. And Max is so unlucky, getting crashed out twice
I will never forget this race in my life.
Ocon you champ. Hats off to Alonso, however.  Alpine you did yourselves proud. Seb & AMR, very happy to see them on the podium again.
Now I understand why Hamilton falling down to last place at lap 7.
Hamilton looked exhausted from the amazing battle with Alonso in the end.
This was an INCREDIBLE race.  Love seeing an Ocon win and LOVED seeing Alonso back at it again.  I so so so hope for a season where Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari, McLaren, and Alpine are all up front battling.
merc at it again
The funniest thing I've ever seen was Lewis being all alone on the grid
Definitrly not championship material...
And just like that Bottas got his contract extended
Imagine how boring This season would be if Redbull werent so competitive. Lewis would’ve won the wdc this race probably.
Bottas took out both Red Bull cars!!!!! ha hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Schumi defending verstappen so long was amazing in that dogshit haas. And that from a rookie
Crashgate 2.0 ?
So great for the nice guys to win!
Toto : Valtteri, took both RED BULLS out
*Lewis alone on the grid* Lewis: Bono my competitors are gone
That battle between Alonso and Hamikton was epic, Bottas on the other hand made a rookie mistake and uprooted the whole Grand Prix, he needs to get his head out of his A$$ if he wants to drive for Mercedes next year... having said that, I can't see Mercedes bringing g in Russell or any other driver that would potentially challenge Lewis they will always avoid another Hamilton/Rosberg saga.  Bottas is in a way perfect for them because he is not a threat to Lewis, however they likely expect him to at least challenge for 2nd place more regularly.
I’m so proud of Russel and latifi !
They should've shown more of Alonso's defense. He's the reason Hamilton didn't win.  Great drive by Ocon, Vettel, Alonso & Hamilton though.
Can't wait for the Red Bull fans' theories
Both Reb Bulls were the target... Lando was just collateral damage (Nice job Bottas)
I hope they banned Mercedes
toto wolf tactics are tooooo stronk on this one. meanwhile, FIA, let's toss dice for the penalties my white haired friends.
MVP of the Race - Fernando "Magic" Alonso
"STILL WE RISE" by knocking other competitors out f the race!
Bottas for driver of the day I think!...🤪🤪🤪
Hulkenberg 2018 Spa crashes into 3 drivers 10 place grid penalty.  Bottas crashes into 3 drivers 5 place grid penalty  Really consistent
Soooo when do we get extended highlights..?
Had Alonso not defended Hamilton valiantly, Hamilton would have challenged Ocon and maybe would have even won!  Rookie of the year indeed
Why didn't you show how Alonso had brocked Hamilton in those laps? Just to show how heroic is the British to get past Alonso?
F1 = Fraud 1, brought to you by Mercedes.
What a race!
James : Valtteri it’s James  Execute order 33     Valtteri it will be done my lord
Botas 🖕
This is the only way to stop Redbull winning the Championship. To take them out as many times possible.... :(
Hamilton starting alone feels like migrating host in F1 online lobby
It was as much Alonso's effort as it was Ocon's in the first victory for Alpine.
What a season this is turning out to be! 🏁
RUSSELL❤️
Great recovery drive from the GOAT : D
The race result is astonishing but congrats for Ocon & hats off for Alonso as he helped Ocon to win the GP by holding Hamilton for a long time."What a team work! "
Daddys cash lance stroll with daddys cashhh🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Amazing Alonso.. Amazing... All the tricks he used not to get passed.. Just insane skill.. Got me jumping out of my couch
Toto: "Valterri we need you to take out the two RedBulls today. If you don't do it, George will have your seat.
Punting off your rivals every race: the new Mercedes strategy.
Brilliant strategy from Mercedes to have Bottas take out the 2 Red Bulls😂
This needs an extended highlights reel! Might as well throw in a Snyder cut.
It's lights out.
just like in random online lobby . 1st corner winners.
Well Bottas gonna have his seat in 2022 lol
Vettel chasing ocon was like lion hunting his prey
I'm just going to say... Latifi has more points than Russell... that's all.
Whenever lance is out of the race Vettel always steps on the podium 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Well you can hate lewis but you have to admit it was only because of him we were on edge our seat all the time...😅😅😅
Lewis: Hmm people will get suspicious if I crash Verstappen again. Valtteri: Hold my beer
This race was so epic 1. Lewis back at 1st in the Championship 2. Mercedes 1st in Constructors 3. Ocon's maiden win in F1 4. Vettel's 2nd podium in 2021 since Baku 5. Alonso v Hamilton duel (2007 Flashbacks) 6. George's first points with the team 7. Williams now at the points  Does this get any better?👌👌👌
Strategy, if hamilton cant knock out the rivals out, bottas will take care of the rest.
Alonso proving that age is just a number, Ocon proving he deserves that long term contract with Alpine. Great day for Alpine :)
2:29 Just feels rights to hear the name "Schumacher" said in a battle for a position.   We dont hear it everytime because the Haas is a backmarker. Hopefully he gets in a better car in 2022 so that we can see his potential.
summing up the whole race it was the race which i half wanted and half didn't  I wished that seb some how finish 1st or on podium the favourite part also max increase his lead from lewis  what i didnt want was lewis to lead redbull and max to lose  and the most surprising was I, just joked that if mazepin (as we all know the memes about mazepinbeing paid by horner to crash into lewis) crashed into max( for being paid one more than what redbull paid) then there would be the best result for mercedes
Ruined yet again by the shouting commentator. Dreadful.
1. big turn crash that causes mayhem and a grid scramble 2. red flag with lewis the only one on the grid to start 3. williams p2 4. hamilton beasting his way up the field 5. great defends by Schumacher and Alonso 6. everybody going "AAAAAAAAAAAAAA" in the radio 7. Two point finishes for Williams with Latifi leading 8. Ocon win, vettel 2nd 9. everybody runs out of fuel and 2 podium drivers having to running back to the pitlane   Uh yea this was quite the day for F1
We all know who was THE MAN in this one! Raw talent!
1:19 One of the coldest images in F1.
Poor perez
Romain Grosjean would be proud of Bottas' turn 1 masterpiece.
Hats off to Max. Phenomenal drive with that massively damaged car, still was able to overtake drivers who didn’t have damage and with 5 pitstops finished P10. Really maximized driving half a car👏👏👏 Unbelievably unlucky though
Destroying both redbull in a single strike. Name a better wingman
Maldonado join Mercedes
Yeah they really need to get Valtteri off of Mercedes that was such an idiotic mistake
latifi and russel were amazing
01:17 I wonder how the start would take place if Hamilton changed his tyres also! 🤔
Thank you Alonso 🙏
Congrats to Ocon 👍😁 brought to you by Alonso and special thanks to Bottas ;)
Mercedes: We welcome competition 1:23 Mercedes: Yes, like this
when i tuned in i thought i'd watch an f1 race, not a bowling match...
1:20 it’s so weird seeing only one driver on the grid during a restart…
Aaay Williams getting 6 more points than the last two years combined
A great race indeed: Dramatic crash ✅ Mercedes DNF✅ Unexpected Podium✅ Charge through the field✅ Brilliant driving✅ Backmarker points✅  And now we wait for Belgium
Toto       : Valtteri Execute order 66 F1 gods : No Execute order 66 + Alonso
Hats off to Alonso. Holding off Hamilton for such a long time in a slower car on an older, slower tire was just pure racing masterclass. He's still a beast!
Ocon better buy Alonso dinner for a month.
its gotten to the point that Merc are doing anything to stop red bull
Bottas got new contract Ocon first victory Seb another podium Alonso made lesson of defending drive
This was definitely race of the year.
Nothing against Bottas but the energy Russel will bring, battling Lewis and Max!  That'd be fun.
Bottas forgot he wasn’t playing f1 2020
Imagine if Hamilton would have pitted as well. What an akward moment would that have been. It's still an image I will remember for the rest of my life.
I enjoyed every single minute, and every single lap of this race. Oh my godness this is fantastic!
Fernando Alonso, The great wall of China...
Valtierri it's james....yes... it's your turn this week
Another mercedes strategy to prevent red bull victory 😀😀.
I just knew Esteban would finish strong in the points, but to win his first ever Grand Prix amidst the chaos in this one....I'm so proud of the young man. He's a GP winner now.
Alonso stopping Hamilton from winning is just poetry and revenge for the mclaren years
The turn 1 incident makes you wonder if your watching some kids go karting or supposed professional drivers
1:18. In my 20 years watching F1 or racing in general, I've never seen anything quite like this. Hilarious.
I wished they showed more of Alonso’s defending
Bottas might get a contract renewal... if  he can keep giving Hamilton advantages  like that
Max again he would have won otherwise
1:19 Hamilton perhaps wondering if Bottas made a quick work of everyone !
The action after the break will be either kinda historical with Max coming back strong and actually winning the championship or it will be a 💔 I really hope Max wins the championship, he so deserves it!
The biggest reason that ocon won is alonso's defence. What a defence
Bottas took out both Red Bulls. Thanks Nico for pointing that out.
Watch Hamilton haters blame it on Hamilton 😂
Classic race Hamilton vs Alonso🙌
Drive to survive episode on this calling it rn
How much u wanna bet the starting crash was premeditated
MAFIA: Mercedes Administered FIA
What was Stroll doing on that turn lol
Ocon winning, Vettel 2nd, both Williams scoring, lap 1 chaos. and it’s Hungary
WOWWWWWW congrats to Ocon!!!!!!!!!!!
What a rookie from Asturia
Vettel and Ocon owe to Alonso for holding Hamilton for too long. If got one more lap, Hamilton would have win. Congratulation to both Ocon and Vettel. Great and awesome race.
Mercedes™️ Master 🅱️lan
Hamilton also made history only one driver to start on the grid
Who cares about ocon, RUSELL GOT POINTS
What could Mercedes have been thinking not bringing Hamilton in for slicks?
Max bad luck
Drivers: We are not going to race with you. Hamilton: (⌣̩̩́_⌣̩̩̀)
Hamilton on the radio when he and Alonso slightly touched: “Thats so dangerous at these speeds”  Yes Lewis, yes it is. Ask Max
Everytime Russell score points Ocon gets on the podium.
bottas crashed for his seat in 2022
Wasn’t expecting that at the beginning of the day.  Awesome drive from everyone
Pretty entertaining Race.
Lewis Hamilton today truly gave new meaning to 'We Race as One' at the standing post red flag restart. Chuffed for Ocon and Vettel.
Ridiculous, just ridiculous
What a thrilling race! Happy for Ocon as well for Vettel. Great job from both of them.
Alonso... Old fox!! Has the best defensive skills... Reminds me 2007 McLaren season...
Netflix is going to go bonkers over this one
Hamilton restarting the race on an empty track has got to be one of the funniest bloopers in F1 history.
THE JOB DID A FANTASTIC GUYS!!!
Bottas driver of the day😍 Secured Hamilton 8 title!
Bottas drive of the year for Merc, he just gave the championship to Lewis!!!!
CheaterCedez and Fraudmilton Master🅱lan Tactics :  1. Block Redbulls at qualifying. 2. Use Bottas as weapon to take down two Redbulls. 3. Redflags, free repair for Fraudmilton car. 4. Fraudmilton race with almost no competitor.
Nico on commentary was awesome ❤
Alonso won here for the first time eighteen years ago with Team Enstone. This is such a nice coincidence. Happy for Esteban, he deserves to fight for the title one day.
Bottas has out-braked himself out of a mercedes
i didn't know that Bottas also had a talent for curling.
F1 desperately needs reverse grid system REALLY BORING WITHOUT!!
Can we adjust turn 4 to make for better racing? The amount of times it forces battles to die is annoying…
"You've been hit by, you've been struck by A smooth Bottas"
🥳🏆🤩Ocon…Alonso…Alpine-Renault🤩🏆🥳                     ⚜️⚜️Alpine-Renault⚜️⚜️                           The One To Watch
Greate drive by Lewis
hamilton had an insane race though to finish 3rd after all that
Bottas in turn one: "Im sorry litte ones" Toto after that: I must send a lot of e mails
Dude Hamilton dropped 7 seconds in 2 laps with Vettel. Alonso masterclass defending prevented Lewis from winning.
"To all my critics: ....(silence)"
The race where drama, action, surprises and memes come together
Alonso vs Hamilton needs its own highlights reel. Scintilating!
Every battle from Alo and Ham should have been in the highlights, terrible editor
can we appreciate the commentator how passionately he guides this race 👏
Alonso👏🏾👏🏾
I literally had tears in my eyes when Alonso lifted Ocon after his win
Ricciardo: right, Norris is out, this my chance to reduce my points gap to him Also Ricciardo: doesn't score a single point
Nico Rosberg secret hero of the day. What a fantastic commentator
Netflix gonna love this race
imagine telling someone a few years ago that verstappen and schumacher would be battling wheel to wheel, williams with double points, and ocon wins the race
0:13 2:03 2:46 5:34 6:14 6:16
What a race! Complete madness
Fernando Alonso defended like Sergio Ramos.
Without bottas, this will never happen
Bottas got the order from merceds if you want to stay in 2022  crash both the red bull cars.
Im absolutely gutted…I’ve been a Lando fan for the longest time and now today I’m so sad to see what could have been history, come to a close. Maybe next season😢😖
It seems that Bottas is getting paid and renewed this year :S. What a great performance!
what a drive from ocon
2:22 hey look an incident involving Mazepin that wasn’t his fault. What were alpha Romeo thinking releasing kimi there
Alonso did that with a car 1.5 seconds slower than Hamilton, older tires and no DRS. Admirable.
Alonso remember Hungary 2007 and destroy hamilton again)
1:20 USA 2005 got nothing on this LOL
Holy mowly
Fair play to fernando at 40
5 places grid penalty for Bottas is truly injustice for pèrez lando and max.
So... Bottas rams off multiple cars... Schumacher forces contact with Verstappen... And the lucky asswit Hamilton gets away unscathed again. I'm sorry but this is just ridiculous. Where're the repercussions for causing damage to other cars for crying out loud?
Best race of the season by far
1:19 😂😂
What a insane race it was! Williams finally got points, Hamilton is the only one to start on the grid and Alpine’s first ever win! So many crazy stuff happened!  Congratulations to Ocon for winning the race, you deserve it! 👏 🏆
We need longer highlights 7 minutes not enough
Alonso defending the highlight of this race. Don’t care what anyone says. The man is a legend.
Thanks to bottas
Its lights out and away we go, Norris, Bottas, Perez, Leclerc and Stroll are OUT of the race.
Verstappen's two consecutive races getting ruined without making a mistake 😑 Mercedes:- That's Our Master 🅱️ lan
Similar to Monza 2020, a new Grand Prix winner, who is French, in a half-decent midfield car, with the usual suspects taken out...
*INTERESTING TACTICS* by Mercedes.
Toto: So Team, what have we learned from Silverstone? James: That we can torpedo any driver with impunity? Toto: Yes James, but you have to be ambitious, this time we try to take out the current top 5, except Lewis, just to be sure. James: Say no more.  James: Valtteri, It's James.
2:20 Mazepin, what a meme, sticks it in the wall or crashes while hardly moving 😂😂😂
Legend has it, if Alonso didn't lock up, Lewis would be still trying to pass him.
I hope everybody enjoyed the Hungaryan Grand Prix. Greetings from Hungary for every F1 fan.🇭🇺🇭🇺🇭🇺
Tray bon tray Bien lol
Bottas taking out all 3 of the drivers that could challenge Hamilton in any shape or form. He got the 2022 seat.  Real talk, does anyone have Singapore 2009 flashbacks?
Honestly Bottas should be suspended and Mercedes investigated for the predetermined hit on Red Bull, he wasn’t even close to making that turn
The saddest thing in this race is that Norris did not finished in the top 10 like every other race this season and it wasnt even his fault
Several keynotes from the 2021 Hungarian GP: - 1st win of a French driver in a french car in 25 years! (Oliver Panins + Ligier in Monaco 1996). - Less cars in the start of a GP since USA 2005 (6 cars then). - 2 Williams in the points (finally some points for Rusell!!!) - Alonso vs Hamilton in Hugary 2021 > Senna vs Prost in Silverstone 1993.
Alonso is a monster! Incredible defensive driving
What a race!!! Vettel, Alonso, Ocon, Russell 💚💚💚💚
Intereresting tactics.
What a race!!
10 out of 5 rating. Fix no debate.
I don't even know how many times i say the first corner chaos , it was oddly satisfying.
Wew we got lucky Hamilton messed up with the tire change...so there is still some hope for max... it was really looking like an easy win for ham... also every time Williams scores a point Russell is the one behind lol..
You guys should watch this (at least the first 30 secs) at 0.25 speed. Enjoy the commentary. You’re welcome
I think Mercedes lost Hamilton the race what is going on with that staying out on intermediates what sort of decision was that!! Happened a few times with Mercedes there seem to be quite prone to not making the right decisions when it matters
El que Bottas se acercara a verstappen y cerrarlo era algo ya preparado previamente. Abran los ojos. Lo de norris fue un daño colateral.
I love having Rosberg as a commentator
i want lewis to win this championship so he can be 8x just so we can have a new record and then i hope the young gen can take over but if not i’m fine with hamilton he deserves it
LH - Driver of the day
And just like that... Bottas is officially not going to be retained by Mercedes.
Hungarian Grand Prix 2021 exists  *drive to survive entered the chat*
maFIA
Dear F1,can we get more of Nico Rosberg as commentator,please!
Everyone forgot about Russell's points lol
Mercedes really not wanting it easy this year huh
alonzo had done an incredible job 👏🙌👌
Day of miracles : Ocon P1, Alpine 2 drivers Top 5, Alpha taury 2 drivers Top 7, 2 Williams score points ! that's beautiful !
Latifi, after being insulted by Ticktum, not only managed to score points, but also finished ahead of Russell and ran in PODIUM POSITION for some laps
Is nobody going to talk about how disappointing Ricciardo's performance has been? 11th with 5 cars out, come on mate!
Lando and Valtteri finally crush 👀
Redbull needs to drive tanks
i actually enjoyed rosberg as a commentator today
If only they had given Seb a normal pitstop, he would have won.
Alonso made this race
pain for max brilliance from alonso, hamilton,latifi, oh just about everyone who didnt crash out :O :D
I live near the circuit, went out cycling and as soon as it started raining I was like the race is going to be EPIC
I honestly don't understand why Lewis didn't get driver of the day.
Bad game by Mercedes,very very down.
Let's not forget that Williams score more points than Red Bull in the last two races
Today was weird
Bravo Okon!!?
Bottas. Best. Teammate. Ever!!
What a fantastic race - rain - then dry. An all time defense by Alonso, great teamwork from williams and Alpine, amazing recovery for hamilton, and an impressive run out front for Ocon - first win in Formula 1
1:19: introverts be like😄
still only 7 mins?
Idk what's it with this year, but the relatively boring races like France and Hungary are turning out to be absolutely spectacular
Bottas just earned his Mercedes seat 2022.
lets just call en total idiot, bottas
Keep crashing F1 rivals, especially Red Bull drivers, that's the way Mercedes to get the lead or win...
TOTO "Bottas, Hammilton's ego NEEDS a win, Take them out"............Did Bottas ever get a penalty fore killing everyone??
Amazing Alonso...awesome !!!!!
Great race by Alonso Apparently Bottas had a front right puncture when Norris went on his inside See his POV you can see clearly
Toto: "Ready the Torpedo." Bottas: "Copy that."
Dare I say it? Race of the decade?
Alonso is a hero keeping Hamilton back
T1 was some F1 games online lobby and Stroll nearly did a Tiametmarduk
Perez definitely needs to crash into hamilton in next race.
Well done crashcedes
Great recovery drive by Hamilton! From last place to 3rd! He would've come 1st if not for Alonso's wonderful defense
vote Bottas for driver of the day!!
what a RACE
Another thing to not forget is Mazepin's pit lane crash. Once again he proved to be the baddest rookie of the season
What even is this season in F1😂
Best race so far and very very bad Luck for the Bulls. Go Max and Checo i believe in you, Max you are gonna be the Champion at the end of this season. Happy Summer break
Truly patheticly desperate from merc to let bottas crash out red bull so hamilton gets in front of the points again... You can't tell me that someone of the caliber of bottas does such a mistake by accident
Valtteri it's James, you need to take out Verstappen, Perez and Norris to win this race.          Copy James
Hamilton alone on the grid was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time 😂
Even when Hamilton doesn't take his title rival out Mercedes finds a way...
What a race! What a season!
mercedes 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Alanso defending Hamilton remainds me of petrov defending alanso in abu dhabi final 2010. Simply classy
You can say what you want, Hamilton kept us on the edge of our seats 😁😂🤣
What happened to Max?
What a race!
Points for Quali + Random Reverse Grid Racing. This would be awesome for competition and exciting races with the faster cars having to do the work of passing.
Bottas secured his seat for 2022
It was legit funny to see ham start and finish (parked the car) all by himself.
Incredible how convenient this mercedes crashes are lately
Bottas did his job well 🤣
Best grand prix 2021 so far
Agent Bottas made a race we would never forget!
Alonso's supreme defence made Ocon win the race. The 50% of the win is his hard work, and i think that's what he is for in this team (to use his experience)
Really great recovery from Hamilton 💥
Bottas took basically 4 drivers of the top5 and he only gets a 5 place penalty... what a joke...why is the FIA so biased towards Mercedes ?
Bottas: "mission complete, boss!!" Toto: "copy"
Glad Sir Hamilton is back on top of the driver's standings 😏🤭
Alonso is a joy to watch.  Legend.
Really pleased to have Nico on the team. Not at all pleased by the inconsistencies of the FIA.  Hamilton should not even be taking part in this event.
absolute mental race
1:19 When the world has a internet connection... But you've found a glitch
Bottas & Stroll are legitimately poor F1 drivers and don't deserve a seat.
SEB P2!!!! WOOO!!! 💚💚💚💚
Incredible comeback from Lewis , Ocon with immense pressure but still won , Alonso amazing team work for Esteban , Max fighting with such 50% damage car , incredible race well done
Ocon went from sleeping in a caravan to winning a GP. What a legend.
Wow !! What a Race !!! 🤯 Both Williams scored points ,  Me ( in Alonso's voice ) - " I can not believe it ".
I see Lewis taught Bottas some lessons in the dark arts of taking out Red Bull’s before today’s race
So last week ham nukes verstappen this week bottas nukes both ham and verstappen seems like merc drivers are happy to make “mistakes” as long as they get red bull
Mvp : alonso
Objective: Pass Fernando Alonso Difficulty: 110%
1:19 last 7 years of F1 in one picture
Many things from this race will be in memory for some time: 1. The crash melee at start 2. The restart with only lewis on the grid (imagine if lewis was also in the pits, 5 lights go out for nobody) 3. Alonso defense masterclass against lewis. He played a big part in ocon win. 4. Seb and ocon just running and running to reach the parc ferme 5. A family had to sell everything and live in camper van to support their boy’s racing dream and then the kid is finally a f1 race winner!!!
The Hulkenberg Era: 8 drivers score podiums.  Post Hulkenberg: 13 drivers score podiums and 3 Midfield team winning.
Alonso saving the race, otherwise toss it in the bin
Croft has the most annoying voice in the world!!!!!!!
What we learned today: Bottas is a lot better at bowling than Stroll.
That slow pitstop for Vettel costed him victory.
Williaaaaaams! Williaaaaaams!
what. a. race!
Poor max, NEVER STOP FIGHTING. Mercedes and Lewis don’t deserve being where they are
It will feel weird seeing Latifi ahead of Russell in the standings
Agent Bottas took all the competition out.
Driver of the day. Rookie of the year.  This is the Fernando Alonso Syndrom.
When Mercedes turn up to Zandvoort it will literally be drive to survive for them
Magic Alonso!!
Me: sees Seb in 2nd on the first lap  *Happy noises*  Edit: Realises that Seb could get DSQ'ed. Also me: *Nervous Sweating*  Edit 2: Seb gets DSQ'ed  Me: (sighs) sad... :(
So nice that Rosberg is commentating
Keep it up Alonso
Nando and Ocon driving in formation at the end, such a cool shot
Lulu said he was absolutely buggered after the race and that it was very tough fighting the entire time leaving him dehydrated and dizzy. The Rest of The Grid: First time?
This race became a thriller for everyone.. First Win for Ocon.. Points for Williams & RUSSEL finally.. Hamilton's Comeback from 14th.. Amazing defending from Alonso..  And a real meme potential with Hamilton starting alone and Reverse grid seen irl...
I liked that little Verstappen vs Schumacher fight
😍😍😍😍😍i absolutely love this race
VERNANDEFANSE
lost my respect to merc
Bottas is happy to keep his seat
Ahh yes The old turn one meme. Ed soundhead is proud lol
Hamilton is only lucky
When the max has to crash so you can beat him
What happened to the commentary at the start of the race?
OKAY NOW HOLD UP. What the fu** was this race?!
VALTERI "BOSTA" . FIRE HIM NOW!!! RUSSEL IN BELGIUM!!
Alonso >>> Steak >>> The Vegan
Best driver today: Alonso
Thank you Bottas !!!
Plot twist:  Toto sent an email to Bottas asking him to take out the redbulls for a new contract
Legend race ever!
Anyone on F1 TV from the beginning of the race? But props to the Pit Commentators, they did an excellent job as always!
Mercedes cheaters!
All: Fairplay!! Mercedes: Never heard about that.
Valtteri, It's James. Please don't brake into Turn 1.
Well, what a result in the end! Seriously messy stuff from Valtteri and Lance... they should be ashamed of themselves.  Big congratulations to Esteban Ocon on his first victory! And to all the marshals, on this track and every single track: Thank you.
Hamilton might have thought that Bottas took out everyone as he lined up alone on the grid at the restart
Valtteri we need points on max today you got a copy?      "Ya I copy"
and for the ones that did not see the stop for max on lap 21 was 1.8 seconds
Lewis looked to be in very bad shape on the podium. Severe dehydration and dizziness. Hopefully he doing okay. A great recovery drive from him and almost taking the victory if Alonso didn't defend with all his might. Incredible battle that was.. Overall, a great race. Wishing all the drivers a great summer break. See you on the other side guys!
Russell crying after getting points for Williams made me cry.
Rookie of the year: Fernando Alonso
Double points for Williams! Congratulations to Villeneuve and... oh wait...
Bravo Alonso. You are the best
And me thinking that mazes🅱️in was going to be the most hated driver of all time, crazy to think that the driver with the best numbers in f1 (Hamilton) probably is the most hated as well, specially after Silverstone and lots of people booeing him shows the hate he has now
5:21 a picture for eternity and a race that will be never forget
Honestly, Bottas should be fined whatever the cost of that was.
Bottas is the greatest pool player!! How he aimed!! How could he hit all of Ham's opponents in only one strike!! Awesome!! Shame on F1!!!
The race ENDS but Ocon and Vettel keep running... 😂
00:13 best moment of the race. Redbulls are taken out by Bottas
Well said Rosberg, well said: Bottas took out the 2 Red Bulls!
It was a stike for Bottas 🎳
Let's not forget finally since Monza 2018, Both Williams scored points! Russel and Latifi did a Mega job!
Mercedes new magic boton: "bottas mode torpedo"
2:51 HEY MAX LOVERS TELL UR KID TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE AND THAT HE IS NOT ALONE IN THE RACETRACK. HE LOVES TO TURN INTO RIVALS.
Execute order 77
Drive to survive S4 ;)
Bottas wanted to one up Hamilton and take out more than just one Red Bull.
Hamilton on Alonso: " At this speed thats so dangerous." He must have seen the irony there.
Bottas: Hamilton, how can I help you today? Hamilton: Take both RedBulls out
Ducking stroll diving on the inside, taking out my boy Ric
There seems to be a law in the universe that prevents both Astin Martins to finish in the points at the same GP. Either Vettel or Stroll are in the top 10 regularly, but so rarely both of them.
This will be one of the best races every in f1.
Driver of the day was technically Bottas, at least when it comes to affecting the race outcome.
when george technically didnt score his williams points before his teamamate did :\
5:13 I think Alonso would have cemented himself a spot in the F1 hall of fame if he spun out Lewis here 😂😂😂
BOTTAS 👉 Grosjean Spa 2012
Alonso >>>>>
It would've been perfect if alonso is successful defending from lewis and let sainz took 3rd
This race was fantastic, with a underdog winning and Alonso battling lewis like wild and making me scream for Alonso to defend, and very happy for Seb getting the podium and Williams getting points
Max was unlucky but what a great drive from Lewis.
I hope Max gets to watch the duel between Alonso and Hamilton, because that is how you race wheel to wheel, show your opponent respect, give the crowd the entertainment they paid for and bring your car home.  Well done to Ocon and Vettel, but massive respect to Alonso for being such an amazing driver and team player, without his contribution, Ocon would not have won.
Alonso take a bow you are a legend
0:10 f1 lobby moment
bOUTtas
We should thanks Bottas & Mercedes strategy for this marvellous race.. Hope they do this type of crash often using Bottas
unbelievable hamilton luck strikes again, back to p3, he needs to buy a lottery ticket
alonso keeps impressing us
Ted asking when is Russell going to catch a break? Never, he's not the driver the British media portray.
Alonso: Legend.
Hamilton alone in the grid is the reason why we need more diversity and inclusion in the sport.
With all respect to Valtteri, Grosjean got a race ban for a very similar incident but he gets away with just 2 penalty points and a 5 place grid penalty. Mercedes seems to be getting away with a lot lately...
I guess George Russell will still be in a Williams next year then...
P14 TO P3. that's it, that's the comment.
Haas just chilling at the bottom of the scoreboard. But i'd say we can expect a Haas 1-2 the way this season "haas" been so far
Well done Esteban ! Well done Alpine ! And thanks to Alonso !
"OCON WINS THE HUNGARIAN GRAND PRIX"..... you heard that right, and you'd better believe it 🏁🏁🏁
Next thing Mercedes is gonna do is ask the Cam helicopter guy to crash into Max.
Two races in a row Mercedes have managed to perfectly take out Red Bull😂
mercedes has gotten desperate to stop red bull
You either give Bottas the same penalty Perez gets for a new engine plus a penalty for causing a huge crash or you give Bottas a more severe penalty in general. Ridiculous.
*70 laps of HIGHLIGHTS*
Just 2 Williams in points in 2021 😳  Sadly latifi in front of Russell
I am a Mercedes fan but Alonso defense was Gold today!
Engineer: box, box. Carlos: NO. Engineer: Understandable, have a great day.
Ocon to Mercedes confirmed
Lewis P3? I think, it's Bottas fault. He did same thing like in monaco pit - he braked too deep : ) Clearly Valterii
Mercs ruining another race for redbull starting a trend i guess
Latifi the underrated 🐐
Yes Lewis, it's dangerous at those speeds. You even hospitalized Max recently after punting him off.
Bottas just got a new Mercedes-Benz contract 😉
What a race!!!♥️🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Russell scores points for Williams for the first time 😃 Teammate Latifi scored more points then him 😕
Here's what DRS takes from us: the racecraft of defending against quicker cars, and not taking it for granted. Well done Alonso! 👏Probably the most defensive action we've seen in years
Unlucky lando.... Congrats George 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
SO HAPPY for him! That man deserves that win.
This year Alonso is driving with the widest car F1 has ever seen, it's mission impossible to overcome him in wheel to wheel battle, he does give Ocon the win and did a little favour to Vettel also.
This race was wild
netflix will be happy about this
Its so funny just seeing Hamilton start on his own
Toto’s training camp in the last two GPs has been an exact replica of Japanese WWII camicaze training 😂
What a rollercoaster ride it was!!
Hamilton alone on the grid.
1:20 The crying&luckiest lulu baby!!
Ocon must thank Alonso for holding back Hamilton for too long.
The craziest race of 2021. I had to no joke get a pedicure after this 😂
Ocon's win was a long time coming! Congratulations to the newest race winner!
1:18 looks so weird
Congrats to Ocon ! Defending against Vettel during the whole race is impressive...
We love Alonso
This race was a nightmare for Redbull n a dream come true for Mercedes....but ol in ol great drive from lewis recovering frm p14 to p3
Crashtappen Fanboys are still crying. 😭
Bottas: "I don't get the booing" Also Bottas: *crashes out both Redbull cars*
If Aston Martin did that pit stop a second or even a few hundredths faster, we might’ve seen a win for Seb.
Verstappen fanboys are so mad 😆😆 you have no idea how FIA ruling works
Alonso won the race for Alpine
Bottas ruins the race for multiple drivers and only gets a 5 place penalty?
all respect to Latifi, Ocon, Russell, Vettlel, Alonso and Sainz but Lewis' comeback from p14 was one amazing watch. Truly showed us a masterclass and why he is one the greats of this sport.
bottas sacrificed himself for hamilton and for mercedes to go top of the standings, i think he deserves a seat for 2022
Fact: Since 2019 we got at least a new Grand Prix winner 2019: Charles Leclerc, Belgium Grand Prix 2019 2020:Pierre Gasly, Italian Grand Prix 2020. 2020:Sergio Pérez, Shakir Grand Prix 2020. 2021:Esteban Ocon, Hungary Grand Prix 2021.
Weirdest restart i've ever seen..
I never ever liked Fernando as a driver and as a person  This whole race made me gain a respect to him i never thought i would get  And after Silverstone, the whole F1 community needed a race like this, to rekindle the love for the sport again
Alonso: Don’t worry Esteban I’ve got you covered.  Best teammate!
Toto: Valtteri.. execute order 66 Valtteri: It will be done my lord
Great recovery drive by HAM
TOTO: Valtteri if you take everyone out except lewis in t1, your seat is safe for next year
Russell's bad luck curse is finally broken!!!
That Red Bull pit stop thoooo
Were is Max's 10 second penalty for cutting off Schumacher????
"Valtterie it's james. You know what to do to stay in that car..."
You can’t escape it, OCOVETHAM👀😂😂
it’s fk ridiculous that bottas is only getting 5 places grid penalty while he fk messed up the whole race by 1 dumb mistake
First double points for Williams since Monza 2018
Points scored in F1 2021 season: Senna - 0 Fangio - 0  Stewart -0 Lauda - 0  Schumacher - 0  Prost - 0  Latifi - 4  WHAT A ABSOLUTE LEGEND 1!1!1
that rookie Alonso seems really talented...he has been able to hold back Hamilton for 15 laps with much more fresh tires
Assuming it’s undecided, does this help or hinder Russell’s chances of a Merc drive? I think help.
The race was an absolute meme, haven't laughed this hard in a while as you see Bottas play bowling, hamilton all alone on the grid start. Alonso defending like his life depended on it and hamilton then complaining once more that alonso doesn't want to let him through. Both williams in the points, Vettel on podium, Ocon's first win, just crazy.
Hamilton gets my Driver of the Day! Mercedes makes a huge mistake, then to rebound from P14 to podium and getting past the gate keeper Alonso to retake the championship lead going into the break. Great racing Lewis 💪🏾
hamiton legendary man who starts only one
Toto: "Hey Valtteri"  Bottas: "Hey Toto"  Toto: "Do you wanna hear a Joke?"  Bottas: "Yes"  Toto: "Mercedes Seat"  Bottas: "ehm...i don't get it"  Toto: "Exactly!"  Bottas: 😐
Great drive from Vettel may have not been the win but a podium is great it shows he has still got it.  Also happy for Ocon, Latifi and Russell great driving from all of these. But Alonso wow give this guy a title winning car I love watching him.
Bottas did that on purpose 👀
what a race! full of action throughout! conrgats to seb, esteban and williams!
When you realize ocon has more wins that bottas this season 💀
Oh yeah merc for the lead Lv u Lew ham
Question is why Lewis didn't continue with integrate tyres for 10 to 15 lap? And when he changed tyre why Mercedes didn't use 2 hard tyres in 1 stop strategy instead of 2 stop medium-hard-medium?
Don’t forget that sainz decided his strategy himself and not letting Ferrari pit him
Wet conditions never disappoint What a race!!
Like % says it all ❤️
Hamilton... that was gutsy.
Likely team order for Bottas to take out the field. Easier to win a race without major opponents.
And after all of that we didn’t get a single lap of Wet racing😂
Such an exciting race, unbelievable. Great to watch and congrats to Ocon but also to Williams and Alpine
Cunted us by posting the winner before the highlights.. Some of us were at work
Russell crying after getting 1st points as a Williams Driver was really heart touching
By far the most interesting race in my history maybe
Valtteri to Lewis after Silverstone: "Anything you can do I can do better..."
If Grosjean was banned for a race, Bottas should also be.
Congrats to Ocon but I feel even better for Latifi and Russell. 👍🏽👍🏽
1:18 Formula 1 (Hamilton Version)
Russell outqualifying Latifi since 1622. Latifi gets double the points in his 1st points finish
Nice 5th place finish for Fernando Alonso.
Lot of alonso moments were cut out.....
Fernando Alonso ✌️
That race had everything! Accidents, great battles, a great Alonso from the past, a new winner, a happy Vettel, Williams scoring points at last.. Such a shame for Bottas and Norris for different reasons..
Valterri Bottas showing his exceptional rally skills.
Crashtappen cries ah ah again.
Great drive by bottas ....?.I'm kidding 😂😂😂
All we can say is the penalty system needs a massive overhaul from these last 2 weeks.
Props to Nando for that Superb drive by holding that Hamilton Merc behind for so long time
Alonso is the wall that Trump wanted to build.
So bizzare watching only one car pull off the grid
That horn at 1:34 made it too exciting watching the cars charge out of the pits
What a bitter sweet GP
Thank you Valteri
1:20 Turbo-hybrid era in a nutshell
40 year old Alonso giving us 2007 flashbacks. The man is an F1 treasure.
So happy to see Williams getting points
Race of the season! Chaotic wet start, Ocon battling Vettel for his first win, Williams points, Alonso vs Lewis!   I reserve my 5/5 rating for such races.
Is it just me or is the audio blurry
0:40 flashback of Daniil Kvyat's crash in 2017 in Austria
Absolute master class from Lewis hats of to you. Get in their Lewis 👍
It was a legendary race...it was not strange because we used to have Italy always giving us great races.
Nice Tactics you have nowadays Mercedes👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Vettel P2 ✌️
"Valtteri, it's James. Execute Order 66"
"BREAKING NEWS" Bottas is staying in mecedes because of crashing in to red bulls
Wyścig
"At this speed this is so dangerous man" Says the guy who torpedoed it into a guy at 300kmph
Valtrie i just sent you an email with the diagrams on it where the car should be did you receive that.
Checklist In this race we had: Massive collision at t1, caused by bottas Only one car at the restart grid Ocon leading and winning the race Verstappen making a handsome pass over Schumacher (with a busted car) Alonso with his brilliant talent holding Hamilton like a wall Verstappen gaining the position over ricciardo for a honor point (again, with a busted car) Latifi pointing for the first time in his f1 carrer And russel pointing for the first time for williams
The usual procedure when signing a new contract is to put pen to paper; Bottas prefers the more modern approach of a full-on double Red Bull assault
Fia need to fix there penalty system. Perez 10 place grid penalty and Bottas only 5
Not nearly enough screentime for Alonso's and Hamilton's battle in this
2:50 If Lewis did that same exact move on Verstappen everyone would've cried. But since its Verstappen it's completely fine..
quality performance from gasly to take 6th as well as fastest lap! what a recovery drive
1:18 this is starting grid in 2017 and 2018 when Hamilton was the only one winning every races.
The battle with Alonso and Hamilton should have showed more
Imagine if Hamilton was in the pit lane before the sec grid start....empty grid 😂 or more chaos than a mazepin dnf?
when you realize that Russell finally gets points for Williams but then you see that Latifi has to spoil the party and outscored him
Best race of the year so far
The Alpines stole the show.
1:19 is the moment you all are searching for
If Lando could had continued, he would have literally won the race considdering his achievements so far this season
Alonso defending from Hamilton was beautiful.
Alonso found his inner Petrov
FERNANGO ATLONSO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great drive by Ocon and Vettel but they really need to say thanks to Bottas, Latifi and Alonso
Wow, just wow🤯
Vettel!!
Both Williams
hamilton at radio, this is dangerous at these speeds... what an hypocrite guy
latifi to merc
The Redbull Mercedes drama is just escalating every race
Albon's gonna have a hard time recreating that crash
DID I REALLY JUST MISS THIS RACE
Wolfe to Bottas- "Sweep the leg.. no mercy"
Hamilton by himself after the restart was the funniest thing so far this season
That was a amazing race I missed some but ir was amazing
What a race
1:19 That is a cursed race restart if i've ever seen one
Nobody talked about Max's damage!!
Everyone sleeping on latifi's performance 🔥
1:23  Indianapolis 2006 remastered
The best race of the season so far 😀😀
Bottas is way bettr than Hamilton, he took out both Redbulls without even touching them.
This season is pure box office
Toto be like: ok Valteri full send it in turn 1 but make sure *NO CONTACT WITH LEWIS* if you hit lewis the only man who can replace you is                *N I K I T A        M A Z E 🅱️ I N*
And Mercedes are wondering why no one likes them 🙈
The restart was the best thing i saw in years
Let's handover the P6 award to Gasly before every race start.
1:19 Lewis' opponents:
Alonso is on another level 📈
Congrats to Mercedes, they really crushing the competition this year!
Alonso moved so much under braking still wasn't given any penalty if it were lewis or bottas then it would have been a different thing and they would have gotten penalised.
Bottas took out both Redbulls, what a team player, they should give him 2022 contract asap
"Valtteri, it's your turn this time" - Toto, probably
Chad Alonso being a brick wall holding back Lewis for a solid 10 laps with a less fresher tyre in that car.
The one time it's actually bottas's fault 🤣🤣
That Alonso guy is gonna be special.
Happy for Ocon and Vettel
might as well just do an extended highlight for this race   so much happened
Russell finally got what he deserved at Williams Now onwards to Mercedes
This race was MAD!and amazing
Esteban bien joué ✌️
"Not bad for an old guy?"
Nice work from Bottas, also did anyone spot Verstappen banging wheels again ...
Great drive from ocon, vettel, Hamilton and Carlos...u can't forget Fernando tho still got that legendary race craft but WILLIAMS FINALLY GOT POINTS. But somehow latifi was the one who scored more 😂
Imagine if Hamilton'd boxed at the restart too...
Team work of the day, Mercedes or Alpine?
Petition for Nico to be a permanent commentator
Alonso’s defense was absolutely insane
Lewis starting alone on the grid still cracks me up 😂
5 place penalty is a joke!! Ruined the whe race, Perez's engine, possible sabotaged Red bull's title fight, and get away w a 5 place penalty.
"These guys, they cannot play bowling" -Fernando the Real GOAT Alonso
I honestly think Fernando might be one of the most promising rookies ever. The fact that he can hold back a 7 time champion who has a faster car and fresher tires!!! I see a promising future for this guy
Surely the Hungarian GP is the best race of the season so far. Will definitely be up there for race of the season
This has to be one of the best faces in F1s modern times
Can this idiot Croft just commentate without shouting, people at home are not at the track !
1:23 That's the moment for years after Indianapolis.
1:19 lol
IN THIS RACE: -A type of cereal destroys cars  -A man sits alone  -And a french baguette crosses a white line first
Valtteri it's James take out 2  RedBulls with McLaren to retake championship leads.
_Dear Mr. Alonso,_ _Thank you for defending the interest to the world championship._ _Yours sincerely,_ _the World_
Well done bottas! (sarcasm)
I am literally waiting for dacha44 and grosjean to make the video ... And also to mention lord mazespin already predicted this havoc!!!
This was the whackiest race this season! Can’t wait till the break ends
What a race
Toto: Valtteri, it's Toto here  Valtteri: yes Toto  Toto: plan B, Jorge Lorenzo Catalunya 2019  Valtteri: copy, understood
The Mercedes masterplan seems to be working
F1 2021 unranked lobby be like
Bottas is totos weapon He took out max and Perez in 1 corner
"If you need to compromise my race to help Nicky, I'll do it. Prioritise Nicky" Great team spirit by Russell and great result for Williams, they deserved that💙💙
What a race!! More of this please!!
the teamwork showed by Latifi and Russell and Alonso and Ocon got them the results they earnt today 👏
If Hamilton was not in this race it would be the greatest race I've seen
Nico Rosberg should concentrate more on racing than on commentary...
Say what you will about Bottas, he is COMMITTED to the team. 🤨
🧙 Alonso the Grey: "You shall not passs!!!"
That defending by Alonso needs to be acknowledged
"At that speed it's so dangerous" - Lewis Hamilton
Give Alonso a Merc/ Red-Bull car and you have a World champion easy.
Use me as a nobody expected this button!😳
For the people who still thinks bottas is underrated well he is definetly super OVER rated
Max smashing someone again F1 feels like home now
This Alphamaxnova1 Edt is gonna be insane
Bottas has been coming in real clutch lately for Mercedes
Latifi future world champion🍾
Russell Mercedes driver next year.
Lord Toto: Pronto Valterri General Valterri: Yes boss? Lord Toto: Execute Order 66 for contract 69 months General Valterri: Max or Checo Lord Toto: Both will do
1:18 Typical sim racing lobby moment right there.
ALONSO SHOULD CHEERING WITH OCON BY PLAY FERNANDO - ABBA !!! LOVELY ❤️❤️
What a race.Well done Ocon, much deserved, not a Single mistake when a 4 time champion is behind you in a faster car. Alonso did fantastic as well. Let's not undermine anyone tho.
Once again we faced Hamilton luck, with have not been hit by centimetres.
Nobody:  Alonso: The sky is black.
Never thought Latifi will give Williams their 1st point(s) of the season.
ALPINE IS GOATED
I am lost for words.
hamilton alone at the restart is the strangest thing i've ever seen
Hamilton... i cant support him. It´s always ... so boring
1:23 "Lights out and away he goes!"
下個窗你看去on the spot me
Lewis is truly alone on the grid.
1:25 He race as one
ALONSO🔥🔥
i m new to f1, can any1 explain me wat is strat? (sometimes they speak in radio, strat12, strat8?)
0:28 Bottas is like "Okay, my job is done"
So happy for seb
Are there using the new car?
Hello everyone
Race of the season for sure! So happy for Ocon and Seb and Hamilton was exceptional. Latifi and Russell were great. Feel sorry for Lando and the others. But what a race. The Hamilton and Alonso fight was incredible. This race had everything. Hopefully we have more races like this in the future!
never clicked on something so fast in my life
Hamilton alone on the grid in that second start is hilarious , the funniest thing you will see this decade😂😂 every other drivers missed their flight back to hungary
George finally getting points after 2 and a half seasons in a Williams and then finishing BEHIND Latifi is the most George type luck ever 😭
1:19 Wait a minute, only Lewis doesn't pit? Wow. That's why I only see Lewis on the grid.
Bottas this is not the way
Alonso > Hamilton
All hail Lord latifi 🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻
Ocon under investigation 😬😬
Valtteri contract for merc 2022 confirmed!
Mercedes   yet again involved  with a red bull retirement
Please have Nico more often, top comments and analysis
Alonso went full 2007 against hamilton
What a race, what an battle between Hamilton and Alonso... Despite Lewis fan... admit that Alonso drive like an masterclass
That is one mean Mercedez tactical nuke
01:11 This start is even crazier than the 2005 Indianapolis GP start! 😨
This Championship fight is over. Mercs made sure of it on last two races.
Hamilton's restart...... Hilarious!
oh boy... here we go again...
Bottas gave his last try to secure mercedes seat.
Seeing Hamilton do the restart alone was way too hilarious
Hamilton alone on the line is a new meme
Albon is going to have his hands full the whole summer break re-enacting Bottas crashing into Lando, Max and Checo. 😭😭😭
Alonso the best in F1 grid !!!!
Bottas hits like a galaxy bowling ball all gone in 🔐up
Max fans manifesting max and Hamilton crashing into turn 1 got half of their wish turned into reality
What made this race special: - Ocon first win; - Second podium for Vettel; - Bottas playing bowling; - Hamilton lonely start; - Alonso stop's Hamilton from the win; - Williams first points.
finally russel get his first points in the williams
What a defense masterclass from Alonso
But that moves ok
Bottas deserved a race ban for taking out everyone
Toto before the race: OpErAtIoN CrAsH
Esteban GOAT💙
Bottas crashes into 3 drivers and ruines their race = 5 Place Penalty Perez needs engine replacement after Bottas hitting him = 10 Place Penalty "PeNaLtY FiTs tHe cRiMe"😕
Bottas: who dis? Toto: execute order 66  *crashing and smashing noises*
What an amazing race.
George has finally broken his curse!
Mercedes 😡🤬
Russell was even up to 2nd at the restart, the lad could've lead the race for a while...
Russel: finally l got some points  Latifi: hold my Beer
williams finally getting what they deserve
Terbaek 👍 Welldone Sir Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes-AMG Petronas 👍✌️🏆🎉
Alonso and Latifi are the heroes of this race.. Latifi somehow kept a lot of faster cars behind him and allowed Seb and Ocon to pull away.. and Alonso ofc.. one of the best defensive drives essentially gave Ocon the win..
Best race of the season Gonna be an F1 classic for sure
Fernando is driver of the day. What a battle with Lewis.
1:18 basically Hamilton 2020
Can we just take a moment and thank Bottas for this amazing race? XD
so happy for Ocon!!!
Totto: Your mission, should you choose to accept it... Bottas: Say no more, I got this...
It's always gotta be Mercedes. Always.
Bottas should be driver of the day for causing the situation these drivers end up with
I see the memes coming guys: Toto calling Bottas and saying: "If you get a bad start, you'll torpedo the heck out of the Mclaren and the Bulls!"
This race was a banger!
Latifi 3rd was the most random thing i saw this season
Now imagine what alonso could to in a Mercedes
Mercedes; Botas, brake very late and we’ll take out both of our competitors.  Botas; Ok, you’re the boss.
Leclerc one of the most unluckiest drivers
GIGA ALONSO
BOTTAS JUST PULLED A LORENZO DIVE TO EVERYONE, BEST WINGMAN EVER💀💀💀
Toto: Valtteri this is Toto, execute order 66. Bottas: Copy
If Max wins the championship by less than 10 points he needs to thank Alonso
Thank you Bottas. Today we can say: Yes Esteban P1!
Only Lewis on the grid is going to be such a great meme.
Race to remember, drive to survive quite literally!!!
Fernando Alonso is the best driver of all time.
latifi must be P1
Bottas at 2077 in Mercedes
interesting tactics by Bottas 🤔 that is one way to secure your seat
Just waiting for Tropical Tree to pop in the comments
BEST RACE SO FAR!!
Just in: Fernando Alonso will be getting  free baguettes and brie for lifetime by alpine.  But srsly, after that godly defensive work against Hamilton, Ocon and Vettel should at least treat Fernando a nice dinner at Nando's🍗🍗.
An amazing race. Great win for Ocon, amazing charge from Williams for their first points of the season, crazy first lap, and tons of chaos. What a way to head into the summer break
💙Fernando Alonso💙
-A restart Jack Miller would be proud of -Max nursing his broken Red Bull to 10th -Alpine grabbing the most points of the weekend -Russell still can't outscore a Williams teammate -Alonso defending like a man possessed -Bottas being the wingman Great show overall
VALTERRI ITS JAMES GO AND TAKE OUT BOTH RED BULLS MCLAREN I CAN TAKE PART ASWELL
I want Alonso as my goalkeeper on my soccer team
I want Norris to beat Max this year to prove these dirt bag.. loud mouths at Red Bull that it has be shown on track on not off it.
This week on destruction derby
Bottas securing his Mercedes seat next season.
Hamilton complaining he can't get close enough to pass anyone and then passing everyone is just classic Hamilton
Bottas: "So that 2022 seat is mine right Toto?" Toto: "Idk, George did score points today and you didn't."
Wow ocon won
Never seen a start like that before
Hamilton: we need to have respect on track Bottas: respectfully accept my torpedo
Remember: Latifi has double the points of Russell Edit: WHAT A RACE!  - Double points finish for Williams - Increased drama for Merc vs. Redbull - Only 6 points between Hamilton and Verstappen - Seb podium - Ocon win - Excellent defensive driving from Alonso - Great recovery drive from Hamilton
5 Reasons why championship is over (maybe?) for Max💔 1- 0 new power units to use for the rest of the season 2- Mercedes is again best on the grid with new upgrades 3- Hamilton very lucky in this start of the season 4- Max dnf’s and contacts without any fault 5- New Pirelli tyres have benefited Mercedes a lot
Other than Mercedes & RB, Ferrari has taken the pole & Alpine has taken the win.
Lewis crying on Alonso defense is Gold.
Lewis Hamilton is nothing without Valtteri Bottas.
Bottas called Kvyat on ideas how to keep his seat...this is the result.
bottas deserves to miss the next race for that bone headed crash.
It's official, Mercedes will sign a multi-year contract extension with Valtteri Bottas.
Ocon and Hamilton had a role reversal today.
That Alpine rookie MUST get the rookie of the year for today's performance. Holding up the charging 7-time world champion for such a long time is just phenomenal!
That start from a red flag was a top class
Red bull masterclass pit stop 1.8❤️
OCONSZN 🇫🇷 🐐
Bottas just secured his 2022 seat
_Ocon got his first Formula 1 win but formula 1 fans gave driver of the day to the driver that held up Lewis Hamilton._ 🤦🏿‍♂️
Goatifi
"Bottas took out both Redbull cars." Yeah, that's the sentence we all know ....
bottas secured that 2022 seat 🤝
Wow, Alonso tryna do his best Petrov impression.
2003 Hungarian GP: Alonso's first win 2021 Hungarian GP: Ocon's first win
Had a dream that Ocon would win this race.
4:26 This is Alonso
FIA STUDIES PUT FORMULA 1 ON OLYMPICS. I'M SURE MERCEDES WOULD BE GOLD MEDAL ON TAEKEVERSTAPPENOUTOFTHETRACK
The shot of Hamilton starting on his own has great meme potential
Latifi Supreme P8
Bottas and Stroll just pulled a Kvyat torpedo there! Pretty sure Daniil is very proud of them 😂
Sometimes all you can do is laugh, and hope you don't get committed to an asylum.
Bottas wants to show Toto that he is important... Lol
Bottas and Alonso are the best wingmen in this race!
Hamilton of the day: Ocon Maldonado of the day: Bottas
Hamilton got schooled today. The defense from Fernando was purely a piece of art. Absolutely masterclass.
i like how a world champion is just casually commenting on the race
Well done sir Lewis Hamilton, great drive 👌🏾
Back where Lewis belong, on top of the championship standings. Get in there Lewis!!
LaGoatifi 🐐
Bowling alley ring
Alonso's race was just something else. He really deserved a podium today
unluck mclaren
I genuinely don't know who's the Driver Of The Day  - Ocon for winning this race - Lewis starting from the back up to the podium - Russell scoring his first points for Williams - Latifi also scoring his first points and ranked higher than Russell - Alonso for epic fight against Lewis - Vettel for being 2nd place - Max scoring a piont with a half car - Bottas for causing the situation how all of this happened  You tell me
Finally!
Toto: Execute Order 66 Valtteri: Yes, Lord
Maldonado: Execute order 66.    Bottas: Yes, my master.
Every lap was exciting and fun to watch 🔥
Keep pushing Lewis
Really shameful move from bottas and stroll but otherwise amazing defending from alonso and an awesome podium!
This seasons looks unlucky for Red Bull :(
Botta's secured his seat now definitely
can we just appreciate the defensive masterclass put on by Alonso who turned 40 this week and was able to hold off a 7 time WC for that long ....👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  he got passed but he wasted Lewis' time to catch OCON
Proud of Alonso and George
Alonso gives me the belief that as a 47 year old man attracting a 20 year old 10 is very possible
bottas earned himself another year contract with mercedes with that move
It takes special talent for a rookie to hold off Lewis Hamilton like that.  Truly rookie of the year, Alonso is!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈
The Re-Start is nearly the funniest, I’ve ever seen 😂
Vettle is so kind, letting young driver to survive in F1 letting Ocon to get 1st 👍👍👍
ALONSO IS G.O.A.T
Alonso battling with Lewis with a GP2 engine as a rookie is very impressive
Absolutely delightful race today  Gutted for the redbulls but max fought on Hamilton gets back from merc mistake Vettle and ocon fighting like champs  Alonso doing what he does best Silly mistake from bottas causes carnage Aad that lando. Couldn't keep his streak
Highlights in 7 mins? Not long enough…
Latifi future world champion confirmed
Toto: Bottas, execute order 77
Plot twist:Bottas wanted to end Norris point streak and everything else was just collateral damage
Mercedes master plan
Stroll.................
First
One of the greatest races in a long time So tangy and jam packed
Lets gooo Ocon and Fernando!!!🤩
Alonso turning 40 three days ago and giving this defensive masterclass today. Legend ❤
You know when you see after 20 laps  Latifi p3 that it is gonna be a weird race
This has been the season f1 has needed for awhile now.
Alonso should have been in the podium places...
Bottas received an email about his contract from toto probably
Ham Sandwich: GG EZ
Bottas takes out both red bulls in the first turn... *all part of the masterblan*
Russel beeing outscored by his teammate in a weird way: I've seen this one. This is a classic.
Never been so early
Proud of Latifi and Russell!
Twist n turns(1st turn)
Hats off to Alonso. Unbelievable that a rookie had the poise and determination to hold off Hamilton for so long.
Astonishing Race
WALLONSO!!!
This is the result of Latifi's tank...
Everyone waits for it :D
Bottas should have been driver of the day for giving us the race of the Season!
Best GP of the year
Albon is gonna have a hard time recrating that one.
Full Race Replay please 🤞🙌
Cmon george
Seb You Did Amazing Win is on the way this season
Alonso best pilot
I waited for this so hard
Spicy!
Le fishe au chocolat 🇫🇷
Let's give credit to Alonso for his amazing work, he's still got it!!
i subbed at the absolute right time just to be early at the race highlights
Lol bottas
2021 is looking like one of the best seasons of the hybrid era
WHAT A RACE!  Rain. Crash with no injuries. No Merc 1-2. No Merc win. Vettel on Podium. New winner.🎉 Williams with points, like what 😱 But Alonso's battle with Lewis topped it all. WOW 💪🏻💪🏻
The season is being great!!
only 7 mins?
Respect to George 🙌
This race will be remembered as a meme by the F1 community for years
with Latifi leading the championship points for Williams, i think he deserves Mercedes seat more than Russell
Nandoooooooooooo
Latifi finished up of Verstappen  Dates, no opinions
Ocon 🤝 Alonso   _Stop Hamilton_
Red Bull are incredibly naive, how in the world did they not instruct Tsunoda during the red flag to crash into Hamilton if the chance arose … he had the perfect opportunity in T4.
Only 2 comments lol

WHAT A RACE
This race is a disaster
Hhh
That first lap looked like an F1 online lobby
First!!
