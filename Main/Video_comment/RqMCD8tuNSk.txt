We warned you LSU ….
lsu fan here... AND GOOD RIDDANCE!
Who’s watching in 2025💀
This aged like fine wine.
We need a remake of this
How did I not see this one until today? This might be my favorite one without Hannah Kuykendall (Hope). She is Miss America every year in my eyes... and heart. 1000000% gorgeous.
You'll also learn how to leave a program you claim you can't win with only to watch as your successor accomplishes things in 3 years that you never did in quadruple the time, all while you still struggle to win most of the big games you play
😂 this isn’t aging well at all which makes it even better.  I’d say he’s doing just fine in the sec.  Shocking right especially since he’s won every place he’s been. ND has gone from a playoff contender to an 8 win team lol
Laughing at all the LSU fans from November 2022.  Guess they cant read the schedule on "Getting Smoked in the Playoffs"  BK cant win the big ones when they count.
Relevant again
I hope Brian Kelly parked some of his $ at Renaissance Bank
LSU lost 30 - 50
Funny not many old comments have not been edited since this came out wonder why🧐😂😂😂
This video has aged too well.
1:10 - The lunch menu has changed from Gumbo to Beat Bama burgers.
Nerd
There are two sets of comments here. Comments from September on how funny the skit was, and comments from November from LSU fans.
This aged like milk
It's funny that this seems to have worked
So SEC Shorts team.  Any chance you'll revisit this one? I mean SEC West Champs was not in anyone's original script.
What a difference the Brian Coaching Clinic made!!!!......Why, in only 2 months, my team has gone from the doghouse to the penthouse. ..From trash, he makes treasure. Even water into wine!! No more Shineola for us as LSU is the real s#*t!!
It was great watching this one two months later after LSU clinched the SEC West.
Here after the Sword in the Stone sketch. Glad they acknowledge this
Well spot on I would say. Lol
@SEC Shorts am I the only one that noticed the detail of the microphone in the press conference being #7 [as if an outlet with the number 7 representing their station] directly symbolizing Boutte who wears 7 for LSU? That’s incredible detail.
Beating Nick saban 1st year makes his contract seem not so bad now, and is already on the way to clean up on recruiting for next year. Everyone is buying in to his program
FSU 24 LSU 23,  LSU 32 Alabama 31 that is why we play the game.
this age like milk!!!!!  lol
Aged like milk
SEC Shorts needs to retcon this video.
It's fun looking back huh
This aged like milk!
This aged like milk and I love it
This did NOT age well.😎
This aged much differently hahaha. Geaux Tigers!
i love this and every other video and they are funny
Dang, the special teams comment really hits hard after the opening kick if the TN game lol
BK = 🤡
LOL Ouch!
ND fans hating at least we dident loose to Marshall 💯🤷‍♂️
Guys LSU lost a Florida State. There used to be a time Florida state was really good the Bobby Bowden days. and remember everybody it is a school in Tallahassee Florida. It's not hard for a school to recruit kids to go to Florida.
Those Brian Kelly jokes got overshadowed
I had to wait a week to watch to watch this one.
These are getting pretty weak 😕
Gotta $100 The L Department is going to be featured in next SEC shorts
Who else is looking forward to this weeks episode
Better see one on Jimbo Fisher - this is weak compared to the material Jimbo gives
Where are the SEC shorts this week? Y’all got plenty of good material for this week lol.
IGNORANT‼️ And extremely short-sighted 👀
SEC Shorts is back and picking on Brian Kelly. I love it
Yall gonna have a good one from that Bama game.
NEVER. STOP. DOING. THIS. THAT IS ALL. THANK YOU.
I want to be a fired SEC coach. That's the best job in the world.  I may not have the "traditional" qualifications or any experience but I'm sure I can lose at least 7 games a season.
Glad to see they avoided any aerial camera work in the Coach Kelly skit.
As an LSU fannn!!!! OUCH!!!!!
Here's main things to look out for when a coach leaves a program for another one.  The team he leaving is happy he left...  #2 They celebrate that he left and thank your team for hiring him.  They say things like he was good but he never could win the big one.  #3 When you hire a coach and the fans of the team he use to coach for still celebrate his victories at a new team.  #4  The fans at the other team hated to see him leave.  #5 Hire a big name coach instead of hiring the right guy.
SAVAGE. The slot on the Itinerary where it said “how to get smoked in the playoffs” got me rollin
BK does through his players under the bus after games. This is 100% accurate!
I give brian kelly two years of stupidity and they will come up with something to give him the boot
BK is a fraud, have as much fun with him as possible
1:20 all I can see is Jeremy DeWitt.
I appreciate Renasant Bank.  Somewhat poetic at the end.
When do we get to start watching TIME TRAVELING SEC Fan videos?  Wouldn't it be great to watch a Florida fan time travel to this years Worlds Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party all hyped up after a win vs Utah only to come back to today having witnessed an epic beatdown by Georgia?  I can't be the only one who wants to watch this.....
Some of these comments are as funny as the Short!  I know where to go every week when I need some humor reading.  😂  As a Nole, I took GREAT pleasure with the look on his face throughout the game.  I think I've watched that blocked kick 50 times.  Lol.
As a lifelong LSU fan I love this. Geaux Tigers!!!
So no mention of FSU whatsoever? Yall went easy on 'em
How do you choose your beliefs, dreams, desires, or even favorite color??? 🔴🟥
Each sec shorts!!! I am surprised the nick saban rehabilitation clinic he might need to apply roll Tide from texas
FSU kicker greased the ball before he kicked it...My story and sticking to it.
You know, when the shorthorns get here and SEC Shorts starts making fun of them (for sucking so bad), I don't think the shorthorns are going to be amused at all. Just saying...
It this isn’t Lincoln Riley…wait he didnt talk to media much
Just an idea, y’all should maybe do something about Michigan South Carolina and LSU and auburn being born into a world where there rivals are the top teams or whatever
10 year deal😂😭
Scotty Woodward LSU AD knows how to buy a coach(at a bargain -hahaha) but doesn’t know how to pick a coach 😩
Brian Kelly sucks 😆 🤣 😂
You forgot the tweaking lessons!
LSU fans.  Be sure to check out all the old Notre Dame interviews of BK when he starts the blame game.   He’s gonna use all the same excuses.
Whoa….A second SEC Short this week!  Thanks!
This proves people are a@@holes...where are all these clowns that were making fun if Kirby smart a few years ago?
What does the clinic cover regarding your opportunity to make a big balls, I am here to win MF,  go for two and shove it down their throat coaching debut? Just curious...
Special teams? WTH is Special about that. It's not like they determine the outcome of the game or anything...
Brutal
You forgot about using a fake accent when you're introduced to the home crowd. Always a good way to endear yourself!
Ouch...
Oof.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love the two in a row!  And, this was hilarious!!
10 years of this guy🤦‍♂️
Yes yes yes! Nobody likes or respects him and the team I hate more than any other… LSWhooo!!!! Hahahaha every single SEC team won their opening game but one team…. Hahahaha yeah that team!
Heck of a fun way to find out the Seminoles had a good game this weekend!
I'm sure there's "no comedy there"... but don't forget requiring your film staff to stay perched on scaffolding at practice during high winds.  Gotta record your teams execution, he's all for that.
These videos are the BESTEST part of the college football season!!
Fun aside, why in the world would you sign anyone to a deal like he got?  His buyout is more than Tennessee spends on their whole program.
As a Notre Dame fan, I approve this skit.  Bravo!
Lol…. LSU made a big mistake hiring this clown with his fake southern accent.
Brian Kelly is  a better fit for the Pac12.
Whoever created this trash, should never be allowed to make videos again in life!!! Karma undefeated.
Already lol
As a LSU fan watching the game and seeing all the miscues, you nailed it! We're not expecting a great season this year. 😩
is it too much to ask that you at least put Hannah in the LSU vids? If we're gonna be miserable in the post Orgeron hellscape probation-like rebuild we need a silver lining.
Now if we could start getting multiple shorts a week…. That right there would be a major win
My laughter always turns into dismay when Kirk Herbstreit shows up at the end. 🤣
"Gumbo, or whatever these swamp people down here call it"
This is gold 🤣
Nerd!
GTH LSU..... that was fantastic.
Meanwhile, Notre Dame is at #5 and played tough at Ohio State.
One question remains. Does Brian Kelly still have his southern accent?
LOL
Can't tell you how much I hate Kelly taking all the attention away from  Leach  and Kiffin. Or maybe how much I love that. Really not sure which.
As a LSU fan, this was awesome and spot on!
The only things that is missing is a reference to “speaking Cajun” lol
Only LSU would think it brilliant to hire a coach that couldn't beat the SEC in an attempt to win the SEC.
Savage!
I needed to hear coach Kelly teach others how pander by disingenuously speaking with an awful version of the local accent.
Irish fan... and I'm fkn dyin 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I thought B1G 10 Shorts was a gag?.
Awesome coming from a LSU hilarious
Great video! Kelly is a clown! Great debut BTW for him in his SEC opener. Too many solid teams and real coaches for Mr. overrated to succeed.
Great video! Kelly is a clown! Great debut BTW for him in his SEC opener. Too many solid teams and real coaches for Mr. overrated to succeed.
We might rip on Brian Kelly but atleast he’s not Scott Frost
Two videos in one day, lucky all of us!!!!!!
Subtitles are broken after 0:40 jsing
All laughs GEAUX TIGERS 🤣🤣🤣!!!
PLEASE MAKE MORE!! ONE FOR EACH TEAM EVERY WEEK
LSU FAN HERE AND THAT WAS SO FUNNY!!!
Little known fact: LAMAR advertising HQ is less than 4 miles from the LSU campus. I don't know if y'all purposefully used their sign or not, but if so 👾
Brutal. WPS!!!
As an LSU fan, I approve of this message. This hurt.
I'd like to say that hurts as an LSU fan, but it's true.
🤣😂OMG🤣😂
You guys have terrific material and are much funnier than SNL now as they refuse to go where the real comedy is, the communist party leaders. TWO video's in same day that were spot on an funny? WTG!
😂 Brutal 😂
So much pain…. But so much comedic material
HAHAHA
Two in a day!!!!  love it!!!!
Lifelong huge LSU fan here, and I think Kelly will bring us back to prominence but I about spit my coffee out with this one. Awesome!
Savage!
But we didn’t want Billy Napier.
Ouch
Special Teams 😅😅😅😅😅
Over/Under on number of SEC Shorts videos remaining that will mock Brian Kelly in some way before the end of this season....  O/U: 3
Just cuz !
The line will be short for LSU to pick up their "L" from the SEC Shorts Loss department. They were the only SEC team to lose this weekend.
Kelly forgot to add these to the schedule:  10:00 - How not to tear your ACL when celebrating a tackle. 03:00 - Special Teams... We are not talking about the short bus here....
LSU fanboy here and I'm fully onboard the BK train....but this was great!
Man, I’m so stoked for this season just to see what you guys can turn out!! Great job as always!!!
Brian Kelly killed a guy
Who forgot to finish the captions lmao
Subtitles cut out right after the TikTok joke at 0.40, a shame as the hidden subtitle joke's are one of best parts.
Hello everyone. Please remember to CC or miss out. Have a great day.
It is funny...but, brutal; however, when you get paid the "big bucks" you gotta take the heat that comes from not meeting expectations.   Coach Kelly and LSU will recover from a tough learning experience.
Iknow some people are just easy to pick on but OUCH!!!
YIKES
Where was the class on how to selectively implement a southern accent? Nevermind, I'm pretty sure Brian Kelly missed that class too.
Jesus is clearly displeased with Brian Kelly for how he left Notre Dame.
Me and my faamiilyy
This was brilliant lol 👏👏
🤣🤣🤣
I’m sure Brian Kelly is laughing all the way to the bank....
Every year there are a few college teams I follow. I make a spreadsheet in Word and keep track of the scores and highlight any games I'm able to attend. I'm from the St. Louis & Live in Iowa, so Mizzou, Illinois, Iowa-Iowa State & my alma mater, THE NW Missouri State Bearcats. But there are always a few I add that intrigue me... After seeing this video.... I have added LSU to that list.
Pulled no punches 💀
It doesn’t matter. He’s making more money than I’ll ever see working 300 years.
Lol  Virtually all of us were happy he left
Kelly you in the big boy League now you're not at Notre Dame you're at LSU we're expected to win championships and complete you need yourself to take a coaching clinic in ravish the management of time preparing your team to get ready for a game LSU football tigers suck last night
This hurts
101 LSU fans apparently saw this
This is masterful.. the fact that you rolled out 2 this week is amazing...As a Dawg fan ..I miss Hope...
What about learning how to execute the team?
WICKED!
Can LSU athletic donors write this stuff off on their taxes? Just curious.
HAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAH! INSTANT CLASSIC! Shame LSU lost a key defensive player for the season though. Special what??? Nerd!
As a Hogs fan, I try to cheer for the conference whenever we're playing everyone else. But if we had to have 1 team lose I'm so glad it's LSwho
couldn't pass it up.   WOnderful!!
SEC Shorts should be invited to do a skit on CollegeGameday🤔 Love how they have the teaching of Kelly way of blaming the lose on your players and throw them under the bus like he did at Noter Dame like he did to Dayne Christ, Everett Golson and his Center in the loss to North Carolina State in the big monsoon rain storm they played in. Note only I am a Notre Dame fan I am a Arkansas fan and I hop they kill LSU👍
1:15 - Guys c'mon.  This guy has a fam-i-ly with mouths to feed.  At least leave him alive enough to hunt for food for his fam-i-ly.
This is absolutely beautiful. It almost made me cry.
Got sunburnt at the Razorbacks game vs Cincinnati and loving these videos !!!
I been trying to tell these people Brian Kelly trash, but nobody wanna listen
Not funny.  Get better scripts.
It hurts, but it’s hilarious 😄😂😩
Grand Valley State is probably happy he's gone
I love this video so much I want to marry it and have its tweets.
LSU fans are going to feed Brian Kelly to a bunch of alligators.   "No body, no crime... Geaux Tigers" -LSU fans by week 5 this season
Funny, fantastic and 100% accurate.
Dumpster fire trash! 🔥 🤣😂🤣
The fact he bailed on the undefeated Cincinnati team before the Sugar Bowl was all I needed to see. Absolutely love that UC beat ND last year.
“Offensive line: Is it even necessary!?” 😂 Legit LOL
Brian Kelly has been a scummy coach since his time at Grand Valley State. Literally left every team high and dry and gets karma every single time.
Ouch!
Special teams?  Brian Kelly don’t need no stinkin special teams.
BRUTAL and irreverent. Love it guys!
Gloves be off!
As a notre dame fan watching him leave was one of the best things I could’ve hoped for. Under Kelly we would’ve been crushed by Ohio state but now with him gone we put up a fight and nearly had ‘em. Good luck LSU, you’ll need it lol.
I would buy a Brian Kelly Coaching Clinic Tee
As an LSU fan I was hoping it would get its own video and it delivered
I like how this is a stark contrast to the one they did on Nick Saban "Coaching Rehabilitation School"... LMAO...
Man... that is BRUTAL even by SEC Short standard!!!!  😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Roasted
10 yrs. Crazy.
y’all do a GREAT job. please keep making more videos 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I heard you can take “Pretend Accents” as an elective once you get through your core coaching classes.
And after leaving the clinic, you'll claim you can win all your games and your FAM-LEE will be proud and supportive of you!
As an ND fan this video is the single most accurate and amazing work of art I have ever encountered.
I love these videos as much as college football itself i look forward to the season for these to come back
How to get smoked in the playoffs 😂
All the Packers fans are equally as confused at the special teams part.
I can’t wait for the Vandy skit
@1:10 "Swamp People" 💀💀
LSU only SEC team to lose this weekend.  Vandy moving out the basement.  LSU moving in.
Fam-leeeee!
He gave Cincinnati the shaft, too. I'm loving every minute of it.
After watching LSU play, I think Auburn is definetely starting 5-0.
"How to get smoked in the playoffs" Jesus Christ 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was kinda hoping you would add to the first one and have a stud FSU guy walk past Oregon and Utah.
Do they teach the really bad fake southern accent?
Brian Kelly is about to lose complete control over LSU. Watch it, half the team is going to transfer.
As a tiger fan I still enjoyed this, nice job
I don't blame the LSU coach... It all falls on the punt returner. How do you drop 2 punts in the same game.
Blows my mind this man has the same number of wins as Saban...
I’m surprised that the clinic doesn’t offer you a chance to learn Kelly’s amazing southern accent skills in a 1 day course.
Let’s revisit this in a year or two, shall we?
Much better than the time travel skit this morning
It's my turn now uhhhhh
We tried to tell you. We tried. This is sort of a get used to it. Yeah you will win games, but will constantly be let down. Team won’t be prepared. If you still believe in him, you will need a therapist before it’s said and done. That’s why BK PTSD is a thing
Tigers are a dumb team.
I was *waiting* for this one lol great job as always!
The lunch schedule was my highlight of this video.  Brian Kelly may have learned how to do a super convincing Southern accent overnight but learning the ways of Gumbo is going to take him a lot longer.
Kelly's been teaching Special Needs, not Special Teams. One game and coach Barney Rubble is already on the hot seat!!!
I am 99% sure our offensive line coach and offensive coordinator went to that clinic.... Thankfully Beamer and the defense skipped.
Spot on with special teams but oline has been awful since 2018
All it took was one game for that much material? We told em. Roll Tide Roll.
Props for not making another recycled “family” joke 🤣
TOO FUNNY, GREAT JOB ONCE AGAIN
This is the most accurate video you've made.  Your videos are truly amazing.
I wish I could be a failure at my job and still receive $9.5 million per year.
Y’all gonna make Brian Kelly sue or something 🤣
SPOT ON!!!! 🤣🤣🤣, BRAVO! 💯💥🤞
There are actually two videos. What a record breaker. Oh and good luck to the LSU fan base because that 10 year contract is looking like a REACH.
2 muffed punt receptions. 2 blocked kicks. Hey, we good. Tre bien
CG effects....in the big leagues now.
Approaching 200k subs!
I knew the BK era was going to be a dumpster fire but this was supposed to be their best year until he's fired in October of 24
When I saw Utah and Oregon get a video, I thought LSU got off the hook this week.  Thanks for the unprecedented SECOND video today, guys!
this kinda sucked and i hate LSU
As a LSU fan all I have to say is to soon man. LOL. Great job as usual.  GEAUX TIGERS
Ok this is kinda rude it was one game
LMAO…That didn’t take long!
Love the shows wish y’all woulda showd fsu getting out of the basement and putting lsu there
Ouch. Geaux Tigers…😭💜😭💛
LMFAO!!   This should win an Emmy Award!
OH THEY DOUBLED DOWN
This was filmed, edited, and released is record time.
Need to make one of Vandy bring undefeated so far
If only there was another coach already in Louisiana who LSU could’ve hired… but they were “above” hiring a coach from the Sun Belt
So glad that college football is back you guys make it so much better we’ll done on both vids
Honestly with how trash LSU played that i wouldve prefered going for 2 at the end.
So Glad your Back!!!!
It can't get any worse than this... says Brian Kelly. Maybe he should wait until the second half is done. GO NOLES!
Coach O: 'Miss me yet?'
As an LSU fan, this one hurts!
😂😂😂
Don't you worry, SEC fans. Brian Kelly is gonna provide so much content for you for years to come.
Yes….take my money!!!!!
LSU is constantly 2 steps forward and 5 steps backs it’s so awesome
“You’ll also learn how to make the worst possible field goal team to make your kicker uncomfortable and susceptible to blocks!”  SEC double doozy
Bruh 🤦‍♂️😂
Certainly this would help a young coach execute their game plan.
"Get used to it."
As a Notre Dame fan, this is just pure Schadenfreude.  I look forward to 10 years of this.
Ironically, just below this vid youTube gave me three shorts... one of Brian Kelly snapping at the media, and one where he says they need to change the culture, and one where Notre Dame players like Freeman better. 😋🐯😋🐯😋
0:42 Brian Kelly should say the players should be executed
I have to admit.  I laughed
The most hilarious article I've ever read had this title: "Brian Kelly will bring discipline to LSU." My immediate reaction was "George S. Patton couldn't bring discipline to LSU."
LSU fan here.  We had this one coming, for sure.  I do think that Kelly will be successful long term and that our performance said as much about the state of things prior to his arrival as it does about him, but that was still pretty funny.
Money up front
Video is amazing BUT   "Gumbo or whatever these swamp people call it"  Louisiana is food and football and you guys insulted both in the same video 🤣🤣
I love this SOOO much.... GO Irish
Where tf is ole girl
I needed some red face techniques discussed.
Outstanding SEC Shorts! With Kelly the material writes itself but you nailed it.  All of us long suffering Notre Dame fans were nodding along with this one.  Love your channel
We asked and we got it. Thank you.
Yeah!!!
Dude, this one is brutal.
Yall did lsu so dirty!😂😂😂.. but not as dirty as Fsu did.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
poor corndogs 😂
I rather go there than Saban’s program.
This is gonna be a long year fellow tiger fans
You guys turned this one around quick!! Great work!
They just don't teach these things in any other coaching clinics. LSU is so lucky the have Kelly and many future LSU coaches can learn these techniques protecting their jobs for quite a few years until the boosters have finally had enough. Then the next coaches will get another 80 million locked in and the process will keep repeating.
LSU fan here. I miss Cade York.
I’m dying laughing 😹😂😂. “I don’t see anything on the schedule for special teams.” ❤️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  where can we get the t-shirt?!!!!!!
1:10 “gumbo or whatever these swamp people down here call it” HAHAHAHAHA
Bruh this like were seeing this like this is a real ad.
As a Razorback fan, I sure do love a good Brian Kelly joke.
These guys have to have some t-shirt printing press or something. How do they get such specific shirts so fast?
Just me or did the CC cut out halfway thru?  (The captions just make it perfection 😘)
Wait did we seriously get two of these today? Making life so much better :)
The fans hollered for it and SEC Shorts delivered! Great job, y'all.
I just wish YouTube would let you like videos more than once. 2 in one day ? What did we do to deserve that lol?
2 SEC shorts in one day alright alright alright
Brutal
The "Special Teams" was the greatest. LOL
Ouch
Brian Kelly may have just saved fsu coaches job
It’s a great day to be a tahger…  Just kidding, go Irish ☘️😁
I'm not fan of bashing college kids for performance on field. But Brian Kelly is a grown man. This is fine...
Where the ACC shorts?
Dang 😂😂😂😂
God bless everyone
This one was savage!
Brian Kelly wears only socks in public bathrooms
This is funny, but you'll have to admit: LSU never quit, and fought like cornered Tigers at the end.
The special teams bit made me literally spit in laughter.
Keep it up. I'd love to see the segments yall would have made when Saban arrived at Alabama in 2007. The fact you want to dunk on Kelly for less then 7 months on the job is telling.
Thats COLD......Brrrrrr
As an LSU fan who was at the game, I hate how accurate this is.
God that was harsh
give the dude time to build his team
SEC Shorts never fails 🙌🏻
Ending is vicious.
0:54 had me dying. Was just visiting family down in Louisiana yesterday and got some Raising Canes and I saw the Kayshon Boutte cardboard cutout. Man even with a brutal loss SEC Shorts still makes me laugh at my own team. Geaux Tigers
Thanks for the bonus one. To good of an opportunity to pass up.
So I take it he let go of the fake accent? I think he set a record for fastest loss of southern respect. We’d rather you have a thick northern annoying style accent than be fake with us
that lsu loss was so heartbreaking yall pulled out 2 shorts! BRAVO
FSU! FSU!! FSU!!!
😂😅😅🤣🤣😂😅breath😂😂😅😅🤣🤣😂😅
"Down in the swamp where anything goes, Brian Kelly will be Alligator bait if he don't learn to close, its the real thing, down in Louisiana. Did ya ever see a Cajun when he really got mad, really had trouble like the Tigers gone bad, it gets real hot, down in Louisiana".  * To the tune of Leaving Louisiana in the broad daylight.
You know... LSU lost and SEC Shorts took it a lil personal. YOU LOVE TO SEE IT.
Why does Brian Kelly look like Droopy now
He actually kills people ... dude is a psycho
bonus!
46 year LSU fan here.  We deserve every bit of this one.
Savage
It’s going to be a long season for coach Kelly.
Funny
It was AWESOME that you could do 2 of these in one day but this one could have been better!
The captions are missing after the first minute. Always love the caption jokes
I was shocked to see two as well today!!!
2 in one day???? Let’s go
He needs to create that faaaaaamily
Can't argue with any of it.
Yup there it is!
Roast!!!!!!
Vandy>LSU
1:25 Perhaps that explains why LSU missed the field goal. 😆
Roll Tide Roll!!
“Me and My FAMILY” Southern Accent. LSU gonna Stink this year under this GUY.
This is exactly what I was looking for during football season. You all are great - and very clever. "Special.....eh...teams?"
The fact that they had shirts made so quickly either means they work quickly or they had them made in advance
Brian Kelly is going to be forced into retirement after going 2-10 in his first year in the SEC.
Y’all cold blooded
You guys forgot to include how to change a Boston Irish accent into a "Southern" accent instantly upon taking that 9 figure job in the deep South.
that was savage
A $2K NIL deal with Raising Canes = Set For Life! 😂🐯🏈
😂😂😂😂😂 I'm dead
Swamp people? Ahahaha
Tbh it wasn’t Brian Kelly’s fault he put out a good game plan his players played awful that’s just the truth amazing video though 💯
Man … where is the FAKE ACCENT… they fumbled on that script … fammmeeeeeeeeeleeeee
oh smack!
Ouch
You forgot: *"How to get your star players to pout during the game and scrub their school info from their bio on Instagram the next day"*
Brian Kelly: Special Tees or Special Teams?
Okay they’re wrong for this one 😂
Ouch
And LSU might lose to Southern next week.  👉😂👈
Where is the southern accent class?
should have Brian Kelly be at the Dan Quinn imperium .
If Kirk keeps getting younger he'll be sucking at QB again before he knows it.
These never disappoint
I’m feeling spoiled right now!
BRUTAL!
2019 was worth it.
I think Kelly will ultimately do well at LSU but like Jimbo at A&M, Scott Woodward really overpays.
The Fans asked and the team at SEC Shorts delivered!
Kinda sad, LSU used to be a fun game for Arkansas at thanksgiving. Now they are everyone’s fun game every week, conference game or not.
Is Butte gonna transfer now?
Welcome to the SEC bk
SEC Shorts.....don't hurt us
Ask and thou shall receive.   Thanks SEC short.   ✌😎👍
He will win a Natty sometime this decade
Here's a novel idea for the kicker, especially on short field goals and extra points... "Kick the ball UP...you know, OVER the heads of the defense".  It doesn't have to go far, just straight ahead and OVER the other guys.  He almost neutered his center with those low kicks.
BOOMER!
The subtitle guy gave up the last minute and a half.  Just like FSU's defense
HOW TO GET SMOKED IN THE PLAYOFFS   OMG dying
brooo 😭😭
OMG! Thank you! 2 hilarious vids in 1 day, so great!!
Excellent 2 videos ! Today!
Ya'll were too nice to Brian.  He didn't deserve you holding back.
Based on a true story.
2 in 1 day. We not worthy
When I saw the tweet today, I knew another one was coming 👀
Dont forget about “ how to leave randomly when your team has a chance at the playoffs”
If I had a nickel for everytime  SEC Shorts released a video today, I'd have 2 nickels.  Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
That's a big oof
You all are fantastic.  To get this video out so quickly is truly impressive.
Oh man two in a day!!!! Y’all have made my Labor Day weekend. College football is just starting and SEC shorts is already turning up the heat on Kelly. Fantastic work guys
One hundred million dollars for ten years of this?   Excuse me, I need to lie down for a moment.
2 Sec shorts videos In one day? Am I dreaming?
Good job guys
Meanwhile, at the special teams room for the University of South Carolina we blocked two punts for touchdowns and made 2 50 plus yard field goals, we may have single-handedly won our team the game, Beamer ball baby!
This makes it hurt less
Not enough dancing
I knew that it was coming 🤣🤣🤣
Brutal 😂 And I will never understand why they paid that much money for Kelly.
I need those shirts.
Oh man they did it! 😂😂😂😂
Their special teams were still better than the Packers last season.
Loyalty is Brian Kelly's best attribute. He was loyal to the last two schools he coached. Not surprising LSU is a dumpster fire.
I love it
Notre Dame is so thankfully LSU took him away from them.
I knew y'all wouldn't let LSU escape this week. 😂
So Upset LSU let him into the SEC... Welp The Boot is staying home this Year! Woo Pig!
That's his official "welcome to the SEC." 😆
LSU gets destroyed by lack of special teams? Do I hear Pat McAfee cracking up in the distance?
10-year nine-figure contract.  Can you imagine?  I'd be acting all goofy too.  Tiktok here I come!
12:00 PM LUNCH Gumbo or whatever these swamp people down here call it
This is gonna be a rough season. Hope the next 9 go quickly....
the turnaround time for these videos is incredible considering how great they are.
Brian Kelly Killed a Kid
You forgot about Brian Kelly talking about every job being his dream job and how to leave a team when they can make the playoffs.  Oh wait, he won’t need that last one at LSU when Saban and Kirby smoking him like a cigar…
If only Dabo Swinney was in the SEC.....
Don't forget the 1986 Super Tecmo Bowl 4 play playbook.  Don't you hate it when they guess the same play as you?
You guys are savage 🤣
That 2 PM meeting  is gonna be packed
Alright, I just want to know who in LSU went to the Voodan Swamp Sorcerer in 2018 to secure the magical season of 2019? Didn't they know there would be a monkey's paw effect for the next 20 years?
I love this hire for LSU 😂😂
Brian Kelly still looking for Navy and Purdue on the schedule. Serious chance they miss a bowl now.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍
They tried to hold off on LSU but y’all asked for it lol as an LSU fan we deserve it
Ya know when most people think negatively of a team they always say either, *"The don't have defense or don't have an offense"*  LSU maybe the very first team we can say that they *actually doesn't have any Special Teams unification* 🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nothing brings more joy to my Notre Dame heart than seeing that snake choke in his first game.
This doesn't even hurt because i am just numb
This is so spot on it’s like I wrote every joke.  Genius troll level. Well done sirs
Should of been a Renasant Bank check at the end :)
SAVAGE!!!
Also always practice, no matter the weather.
So how do I sign up?
This made my day lol Roll Tide
2 vids in 1 day 😮😮😮😮😮
This stings.. Geaux Tigahs, so funny thought
The Special Teams part 😂😂😂 I know LSU fans still salty about that one.  But jokes aside WTF was LSU doing in the Off Season to where FG and Punt Blocking wasn't even something worth acknowledging of its existence?  Like this joke shouldn't even hit as hard cause it shouldn't be logically true by simple 3 phases of the game concepts...BUT WHY DOES IT LAND SO EASILY 🤣  (Joke: 1:15)
As an LSU fan this is hilarious
This one is so much more funny that the first! Got me rolling!
All the corn dog fans on the planet are now realizing…. The AD made another bad hire
LSU really paid a coach 100 million to fake a southern accent 😂😂
We were all waiting for it. You did not disappoint.😂😂😂
Love the double feature! 😂🤣 or should I say double header? 🤔
The fact that y’all were able to write two great scripts in one day shows how great y’all are. Good work SEC Shorts.
Double vids now!!

I knew you would have to make another video after last night! 😂
Awesome video thanks for making me laugh 😂😂 u kill it all the time
Two in a day?? What is this, the fumble count for the LSU punt returner?? Love you guys!
Brutal
If Brian Kelly stayed at Notre Dame would they have beat OSU?
This hurt as an lsu fan.
