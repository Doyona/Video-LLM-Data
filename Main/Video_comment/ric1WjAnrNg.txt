And is one of the oldest people to comment on his video
About 11 years ago, this guy commented on a MrBeast video
About 11 years ago, this guy commented on a MrBeast video
It’s crazy that he blurred his search history!!😂😂😂
Did the apologies expire yet? If not I would like one please and thank you.
Love this video
This was very well done and really imaginative and funny. ♥️
It was almost foreshadowing about his eye
I'm offended.
Alex and Jeff need to reunite. I feel like Alex was the only other real one.
I revisit this every year my all time favorite video of Jeff’s barbershop
this is a christmas classic now
this def was the best barbershop vid hehe
perfect duo
He kinda looks like paul dano
THEY NEVER MADE MORE VIDEOS TOGETHER SADLY
This video made me lol so hard I spit cookie.. wth
I couldn’t believe my eye. I WEASED 🤣🤣
where can I find the full SIMON REX song at the end of this
im offended about the woman jokes tbh :// disappointed
im offended..pls right me an apology now😔
this is the best video
This is a fucking masterpiece.
the irony abt him hurting his eye is so sad
Where Jeff and David still friends during this video ?
i love this episode so much
That duo is just amazing
by far the best episode
alex is'nt fuuny. he's got white people humor, like disney channel d liat movie backgound actor humor
This is amazing! So should work together again, i hope the David situation hasn't spoiled there friendship
The small details are perfect lmao when Alex is licking the shaving cream around his mouth
I am offended you owe me an appology
Felt like I was on acid watching this 😂
why is no one talking about alex doing everything with a half cut head of hair
Ong alex is one of the creators of the awkward comedy on social media! Frrr
this is a fever dream
“You go to a woman for haircuts?” LMAO
I'm offended by the women comment, a man taught me how to drive and I always thought that was pretty dope until I realized it was all a scheme to keep women suppressed ... honestly the only way you can make it up is by giving me the first dread lock mullet cut . Make your way on down to atlanta with your lil ol truck tmand mobile banner shop/home & get me right bro . Or ya canceled 😞
Alex sounds like the Joker 🤣🤣
Wish we got em this Christmas
alex and jeff's humor compliment each others SO WELL. they should collab more.
Yo mom
This is the best vlog ever! You guys need to team up more!
More Alex everywhere !!
best duo
Jeff "I couldn't believe me eye" Love you're humor! 🤣
You two have always been THE FUNNIEST!
xmas classic

I’m offended by that joke
How have I never seen this, it’s golden
In all honesty wtf did I just watch. But I respect it.
I love how Alex’s hair magically grew back when they went through the closet. 😂
Alex wants to be a 1950s noir detective. Even the sinatra-esque singing implies that he wants to live in the past.
Cinematic masterpiece 😪
I genuinly felt high watching this episode lmfao
“ I can sure blow…on that bb 😏. “ 😂😂😂
BAILEY HARAMBE
Jeff's joke is beyond imagination, unique bits

IM OFFENDED
Team up with Alex to save Youtube!
Awesome vid 👏
Wait but Alex sounds like Frank Sinatra??????
0:40 I thought it was Jonah/Nick from behind, don't ask me why...
This hits SO different after you watch his video titled "I'm going away for awhile... Goodbye". He really spent thousands on sets, props, covid tests and paying people, drove hours upon hours to find snow, got handcuffed by a cop with a gun to his head, lost his car, lost his props, hitchhiked until a fan picked him up, had to buy a rental car....ALL to make this video...And then Youtube age restricts it...
The brown apartment happily note because bar cytopathologically treat circa a amused caption. perfect, empty ornament
im personally offended
I am very offended by the comment regarding women driving,  I shall await a personal apology in response. Thank you.
YOOOO ITS BACK THE VID IS BACK

Excuse me but I need more of you and Alex together, please
coming here after watching the documentary.  who else hurt for jeff at 5:10 when they realized that wasn’t part of the skit that was genuine reaction from pain the accident...  p. s. jeff you’re still super hot
cinematography genius
This was legendary
I couldn’t believe my eye 🤣🤣🤣
When are you starting to realize that it really wasn't David who was The talented one...
This is the best one I've seen hahaha
Is this your " Citizen Caine " Movie ?
1:37 overshadowed you know what
I couldn’t believe my eye
After seeing this video, I need these two to get together and do a weekly podcast.
I am that sad kid that just got cheered up, thanks Jeff and Alex <3
What the hell did I just watch?
I feel offended
Don’t know what the fuck I watched by I don’t regret it
6 mins in and im so confused
This is perfection. I can’t stop smiling. Sweeter than Honey.
I laughed so hard at Jonah being a pig
Their sense of humor mixed is honestly scary 😂
i'm extremely offended
“I couldnt believe my eye.” Funniest line.
Bro thank you for this
I'm offended women can drive cars.💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋 edited: just wanting Jeff to respond. Lol
Why is nobody talking about the acid joke? 😭😂 6:40
5:08 when alex threw that big snow clump, jeff actually destroyed his hip in the accident that's why he yelled. Alex didn't know probably
THIS WAS AMAZING
this is now my favorite video ever omg
morgan freeman in the start
This was the first add I didn't skip
i am offended! how dare you say such incentive things. we’re in a new time and you should leave those “jokes” in the past.
Is that Morgan Freeman's voice in the promo?
Ahaha what kinda fever dream
Who’s watching this after him talking about his eye injury
Now this this is a masterpiece
The disclaimer was honestly hilarious 😹
Didn't only save Christmas, saved 2021 with this vid #thankyoujeff
I love you both so much 💖
Omg this was funny lovr it
I love Alex lol
"The one eyed barber" hits really hard now

BAILY 😭IVE MISSED YOU
Bro kewon is in this video😂
🤍🤍🤍
Damn. What a video!

These are the two that can never get brought down
I lied im not a black belt..... That's not even me.doing my own stunts
I’m offended
< 3 3 3
im v offended by the joke at 2:45
This video is absolutely brilliant
They’re such a dynamic duo
I have more respect for Jeff knowing the incident now, stand up for yourself
Did David hire a therapist for Jeff? Yikes, I’m with you on this one Jeff!
I’m offended.
Best duo
I’m offended 😹
the women not being able to drive comment was extremely offensive jeff
Is it just me or does Jeff kinda look like Keanu reeves at certain angles
Good duos: Zane & Heath Joe & Ilya  Jeff & Alex
#saveralph
I love this 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This video was actually incredibly deep and shows who Jeff's true friends are. Keep it up Jeff you are meant for great things. It's your time to shine.
That burning man song been in my head for days now. Wife caught me singing it gave me funny looks I know it means he wants to get high but the wife doesn’t know
“I couldn’t believe my eye”
why is sexism a joke? pls explain
'couldn't believe my eye' 😂😂
he called the eye tho
ok but the cinematography & effort in this vid omg
I love this video so much.
Jeff... I love you man your videos make me happy when I’m sad ;-; I’m like watching back to back rn cus I’m sad lmao
I feel offended ☹️
New sub
Is this the video that cost him 40K to make?
okay but can you please do vlogs and keep being yourself? I need more content Jeff this isnt enough lol jk
Absolutely Genius! Amazing job, awesome humor! This is honestly such high quality entertainment, I just love it...crazy
“I couldn’t believe my eye” 😂😂
this is fucking awesome
im offended by the woman driver thing
Alex is so attractive🤤
Nobody talking about keewan making an appearance
There needs to be another episode with Alex
I’m offended 😂😂 bro this shit is hilarious
Aww this is so cute
Creativity at its max, you should be a movie creator
wagwan billycakes 😎
i am personally offended by the woman driver jokes
well that intro was EYEronic         my condolences.
“i couldn’t believe my eye”
No one is gonna say anything about the Morgan freeman impersonator
awesome
i’m high as fuck this was insane
This video is like a post drug fever dream
Alex has a very pure soul and heart. I feel like he came through on this video for Jeff given all Jeff has gone through since his accident.
So this might be the final episode of the barbershop huh. It’s bittersweet cause I totally get why he’d want to move on from the show but I also feel like there’s so many places he could take it and people to have on still that he hasn’t gotten to. I know Jeff’ll be fire in whatever tho.
it doesn’t make any sense !
This was wonderful
I actually shot my eye with a BB gun , i shot the garage door from far somehow comes back and hits me in my eye shit was weird like I was farrr.
A duo I didn’t know I needed 🥺🥺
only 2 people I like from, it pains me to say this, the “Vlog Squad.”
Im actually offended by that comment women cant drive!!! Also if you reply i know you read this so tell alex i love him and wish he'd put out more content
Love this video aha
when you film with alex 😂❤️❤️
“And then they left” 😂😂
I’m offended
Last barbershop episode is beautiful 🥲
The pinacle of youtube
who’s here after seeing what really happened to his eye? 🙁
The Keewon appearance was great
Why is Alex high key good at singing... his voice would fit that Frank Sinatra or micheal buble style
oh my goodness Jeff! I am deeply offended by your joke about women not being able to drive >:( although I agree I'm gonna need you to respond for I am a woman and am offended.   ;)
Actually quality
Lmao.. Eye couldn't believe my 👁️
The evil scientist looked like Dirty Dom lmbo the ptsd is real
You really bought in Morgan Freeman for  reading your sponsor script?
The girl joke... instant like 😂
great!!! thanks 4 what u doing good job!!
Alex is actually really good at singing.
So does no one wanna talk about how he predicted people using animals as testing objects for there products
the intro alone deserves an oscar
😂 7:16 ayo is the dwarf keewon from Danny Duncan
how is this content free
This feels weird because my name is baily but I’m not a rabbit
he predicted his eye injury
alex is so good
im offended apologize now
The End of an Era
Who else thought he was just gonna  mercy kill jonah
The best duo ever 😂🤣
This is pure quality!
I love these 2 so much
Is this supposed to be bad on purpose ? 😂
I'm offended. Come on Jeff, give me a response
This should have more views
the most talented two from the vlog squad
This was a work of art
Is that Morgan Freeman
So what happened to his eye foreal?
I’m offended
Alex is comedic gold
Bro being paranoid of the therapist so relatable Alex is the most human out of all the vlog squad
Absolutely hilarious!!!! I think you guys did a great job. 👍
I am offended
david should give alex his channel
they needa work together more
I’m team Jeff now. I don’t get why those other ppl didn’t like his bits. They are creative, funny and interesting and most of all he doesn’t make ppl dance around like clowns for a video. Anyways much love Jeff! Keep doing your thing
Jeff predicted his own eye accident ☠️
Love this duo!
alex is such a talented comedian he would be amazing in a sitcom. he gives me dwight from the office vibes
The awful cap interspecifically like because fact connoly separate worth a outstanding battery. cool, warlike south korea
Best one
Alex has always been my favorite
This episode is litaf 😂
LMFAOOO 3:04
what did i just watch😂
Jeff’s production quality is the freaking BEST !
If someone drink one beer and watch this video. They would think they are drunk. You are not drunk.
Jeff: "Don't ask about the eye. Understand" Alex: "Yes" Then proceeds to ask about the eye. Jeff then tell him about his eye.
See YouTube you can't take down the spirit of Christmas it has returned!
POV: your only here for alex
Pleas make more videos with Alex, you guys fit so fucking well together
Is that Vector Bunny doing the Morgan Freeman narration?
I am offended
One of the best videos on youtube

The duo we didn’t know we needed
I legit can’t find that Christmas song they use at the end of this video (10:25).  Does anyone know what song this is?
Enjoyed the story...hope Your well Jeff, good to see Alex of course!!
Wtf is this 😂
you should cut cucos hair lol
Little bit like zootopia but that is OK
I'm offended jeff
I, as a member of the female sex, am deeply offended by the ''women should not be able to drive'' joke and I totally am not looking for a personalized apology.
I’m offended
you should not have to apologize if someone is insulted or offended. If the intent wasnt malicious and meant to hurt, there should be no apology. The person who is insulted or offended needs to see a shrink. If the world had to constantly worry about someone being insulted, then it would become like the middle east where they are insulted by everything and no one can say or create anything. That is why books, movies, songs, new ideas or discoveries are not made anymore in the middle east, thanks to the dogma of their religion and censorship of anything that someone can deem inappropriate.
I’m offended
yo his editing skills are on another level
Jeez what's the budget for this dude
Production masterpiece
I’m fucking offended
If I was a make a wish foundation kid I would choose Jeff to meet me and cut my hair
Get em Nerf
Jeff and Alex work so well together 🤣
Is it just me or does alex looks like Lewis capaldi.
JEFF 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
What even are these videos anymore 😂😂
Jeff and Alex’s humor are perfectly in sync, this was by far one of the best episodes so far.
What is the Christmas song they are playing after they rescued the pets???
This episode is goated 💯
Into sound like morgan freeman😂
We weren't planning on two on two 😂😂😂😂
how did I not see this video before
Great video Jeff
Cheek filler and makeup on Jeff very original and brave
Oh gosh..I love Alex😍😍
This is the best fucking video ever!?!?!?
Can’t believe you actually got Morgan Freeman to do your intro
It’s fricken Morgan Freeman!!!!!!

Wtaf

9:52 😂 I don’t know why that made me laugh
“Okay, so let’s write a short winter wonderland type song. Nothing crazy, just a few verses for us to sing when we first get there.” “Nah fuck that, let’s just freestyle that shit.”  “But it’ll sound horrible. Perfect.”
I'm offended by " letting women to drive car" statement. I need my apology.  P.S: in my opinion women should never leave their house......

I love this
This really does look like a student film.... lmao 40k for this? You should be crying about getting scammed and happy YouTube restricted this
1.5 million views... cry’s about being restricted and YouTube not sending it out. This is genuinely retarded
Alex gained some weight
Alex licking the shaving creem off his lips got me

Why did "put the items in the cart" sound so similar to "put the lotion in the basket"  in terms of phrasing?
This be epic

My god this is awfull, I like it!
“I never learned how to whistle” is pure art
The rest of this video was fine, nothing too special but the Honey add at the beginning really made it for me overall 7/10
This video is a masterpiece
i am so here for Alex and Jeff
I appreciate this video very much more after seeing Jeff's latest gone wrong vlog
I’m offended bc I’m amazing at driving

4:45 Jeff missed the perfect opportunity for a joke here 😂 either him or Alex could’ve said if I would’ve known this was my closet, I’d never come out 💀 if you get it, you get it, if you don’t try harder 😂
Every video of Jeff’s is like a fever dream... and I can’t get enough of it😂😂

Can you please release a bloopers video of this! You two are some of the funniest people on YouTube so I can only imagine the dogging on Jonah and funny behind the scenes of this video.
So ready for a Jeff + Alex movie lol love these 2!
So no ones gonna talk about how Alex licks the shaving cream at 10:22 💀🤣🤣 maybe cause I’m really stoned had me dying lmaooo
why this look like a black mirror episode lmao.
Anyone ever thought that Jeff actually is pretty much identical to Keanu Reeves. Like search up young Keanu Reeves and you’ll know.
The questionable legal phytogeographically blot because responsibility clearly saw failing a cheerful bangle. merciful, numerous salary
I’m offended by the women driving joke, I’ll need a ~paragraph apology if possible

That’s actually a good haircut
This was a whole Christmas movie
I want yo give this vídeo more tan 1like hahahah

I’m offended
i am offended😡😡😡😡
This is what I feel an acid trip would be like
Tf was this😂😂
This duo is unmatched if the vlogs come back🤣
I miss Alex
😂😂😂😂
Alex topped Jeff's energy
wtf was this
Don’t get me wrong, I like the video but I also want to see you just do a regular episode with Alex. I genuinely think it’d be interesting to see how you guys talk with each other and going back and forth on random things like first impressions and stuff like thay
Ugh this video should've been deleted. Can't believe they scored Freeman tho that's pretty lit
"I couldn't believe my eye" BAHAHAHA
a fucking masterpiece
at 6:13 btw that was one of his vines that he did awhile back about missing dog but he couldn’t whistle so he just said “whistle sound” edit: at least thats what i think thats what it was about
we need more alex and jeff
BAILEY AND ALEX FOREVER!!!!
i'm offended
Alex is like Tyler in nardwuar

This is so good
Poor one eyed barber
I'm offended
im offended
jeff why this so funny for no reason
i love you Alex
This is stupid and brilliant at the same time..
It seems like I'm the only one who was disappointed with this one, just because I wanted the usual Jeff hair cutting setting and talking to Alex about random shit. It didn't have to be this weird heavily scripted skit. Just them sitting in the barber shop and vibing wudda been MAD.
I am not offended
I think Alex is actually Frank Sinatra
WHY DID THE END ACTUALLY MAKE ME CRY OMGGGG
I don’t know what just happened
This is a duo i never knew I needed in my life. Alex is an actually godly man.
My Most Favoritist episode of ALL TIME
offended
Bruh all thanks to YouTube i’m 6 days late for this masterpiece.

Nobody’s gonna talk about the hairless rodent joke? Lol 6:17
KEWON!!!
I literally forgot this was Jeff’s channel so when they got back into the barbershop I was so confused
Now this is a quietly

im offended
You guys ever wonder how much Jeff makes
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is amazing.
This is.... beautiful.. this was a whole ass production... I LOVE IT
When he said "Nobody wants a haircut from a one eyed barber" his voice reminded me so much of Ray Liotta's character (Henry) in Goodfellas.
I appreciate this
I’m offended give me an apology. Jks I just want Jeff to speak to me
This video is An Art Piece Though
I am offended!
Wait wtf was that really Morgan Freeman?
One of the best vids yet
I’m offended
Alex is a born Youtube star and Jeff, I like how he has a touch of Family Guy type of comedy in his videos, his sense of humor and The Barbershop is just getting better
There's soo many hidden gems in here I love it
I’m offended
Who is more of a freak between these 2.....that's a hard one....
I CANNOT BELIEVE HE PUT THAT BOY IN A PIG CAGE #herrific
Now this is the Christmas movie you should watch every year with your family
As a woman, im offended
Literally so rude of course women should be able to drive, how offensive.
alex would be the best co host
i’m not offended by the joke. i actually agree, i should not be allowed to drive.
feels so strange to see Alex. i follow him and his girlfriend but it’s weird to see him in someone else’s content
I was offended by the sexist comment at 2:40
alex
This is art and YouTube has no taste
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
I just watched a whole ass movie with a climax and everything in just over 11 minutes
what the actual fuck is this LOL
The idea for this one came to Jeff in a fever nightmare
We need more of alex
I wonder what drugs they took
conspiracy theory: Jeff is actually gay that is why he comes out of the closet every episode
This was an actual masterpiece
Tbh this was a masterpiece Jeff!!! Loved it!! Continue making more videos please!!!!!!!!!!!!! And stay safe and healthy.
Top Christmas Movies of All Time  1. ALEX AND JEFF FIGHT TO SAVE CHRISTMAS  2. Elf 3. It's A Wonderful Life
Anyone else hear Alex snapping off beat around 5:12 😂😂😂 that absolutely broke me

The commitment to the video of going all the way to somewhere with snow just for the forest scene is unmatched
“Look at that hairless rodent”  “Yeah and look what it’s doing to that rat”

I don't know why Jeff talking over this video reminds me of Goodfellas
I’m offended

I don’t get how he fit that entire set in his closet
What a masterpiece
"Dont ask about the eye" "Ok, what happened" 😂😂
i am so fucking offended im cancelling you personally for making a joke about women
We all literally know a soy boy employee at youtube gave you the ban hammer about the girls not being able to drive comment, until a normal employee reviewed the flag
I'm very offended by the joke where u said that women can't drive. (I'm a guy btw)
im offended by that joke
Is this the one that was deleted?
I've been watching this twice a day since it came out 🤣
Came for a haircut, left with god knows what
Beautiful video that will makeup for David’s nonexistent christmas vlog
So can you tell David to upload vlog videos
A true masterpiece
I’m offended
THEY SAVED THE MAN PIG 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
i am offended.
David somewhere punching the air
First time seeing Alex laughing lol  (It's after he said ahhh- then starting laughing)
Favorite freakin barber shop video by far
Omg this is the best video ever
YOUTUBE GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER ❤
I’m highly offended I think when are fully capable of driving cars 😉
Alex can really sing !! I love it!!!
I’ve missed alex
“I couldn’t believe my eye”💀
Best video you’ve made so far! Thanks man🤟🏽
Yasssssss
yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssss
This is good content. High quality YouTube.
I’m offended.
Did Morgan freeman really narrate??? In confusion 😳
i can’t believe no ones talking about how alex went through the whole video with half a haircut
Really love y’all sense of humor 😂
I actually read the disclaimer and now I am offended that you’ve became so soft that you’d even leave a disclaimer for making that joke. Your move Jeff.
As I watched the video I asked myself,  "Why would YouTube have blocked this video?" and then it dawned on me, they hadn't.  That was just a cheep ploy to get additional views on this horribly pointless piece of crap.  I want me view back, and no I won't give it a thumbs down, it doesn't deserve the metric.
Lmaooo what did I watch
Sorry why is this banned?
I know that ain't Morgan Freeman
What is that song at the end? is it available to get?
I could use a haircut Jeff
Shoulda got popcorn for this amazing film👏🏼
If this really cost you $40,000, next time contact me. As funny as it was, I could produce it for you for a third of that cost. 😉
THIS took $40k to make?  What did you do with the other $38k??
I am truly offended
yes
I was legit scared that Bailey was missing
If it's banned how are we watching it right now?
this is my bed time story for now on
Commenting to get this back on recommended
5:20 that laugh sounds just like Sterling Archer, I cant be the only one that hears it.
I’m not really offended, but pretend I’m offended because a reply sounds nice
You guys should do more together ❤ 💓
This is so stupid. I love it.
Im offended
this might be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen
iconic
You made the ad too long, stopped watching 30 seconds in.
i am too high for this
So many bots support this guy for the subs it's a shame. People bust ass for money and one click dude has fake accounts sub and like videos automatically and money was made
Please keep making these videos!! We will always find them and laugh with you!!
Can Someone answer why this video got blocked it’s amazing!!! Goob Job guys!!
When are we getting Beefy Boys episode 4?
If that was actually Morgan Freeman then that’s why it cost you 40k
Alex and Jeff should be a TV show
This guy tells one hilarious sexist joke and gets his video canceled... youtube is lame
as i watch alex, you cant predict what he's thinking. which is fun to watch 😍😍
LOVE THIS CONTENT!!!❤️
i love this combo so much, just commenting to boost the algorithm
commenting for algorithm
Wow nice!
40k? For what?
Petition for youtube to stop blocking Jeff's hard work ...seriously wtf
I’m offended that there had to be a disclaimer and that YouTube would ban this.
I’m offended by the joke about women
Hiii
Kevin Smith filmed Clerks for 30K and you guys spent 40k on this?       Jk, funny stuff guys.
Shouldn't be banned, but not sure I get the hype... To each their own. Happy Holidays
I'm offended by your joke about women drivers!!!
I loved this so much!
It's like, it's not funny, so it is.
I’m so confused.  This video was so dumb.  How did you spend 40K on this 😂.  Maybe I just don’t get it tho.   Cause 1 mil views 👍🏻
Start posting videos on Patreon for a $2 a month monthly subscription I'll definitely subscribe and they won't be able to delete or age restrict your content!
Comments for the algorithm
That was fucking  great
LMFAOOOOO WHY AM I JUST NOW FINDING THESE GUYS😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
A Collab everyone asked for!
i’m offended. apoligize
This video felt like an acid trip lmao
Are they still friends with David and the rest of them?
TW: EMOTIONAL
I’m offended now please give me my comment apology 😂
I’m really offended by that girl joke , I’m a transgender and happy to be a women.
Hey the joke where woman shouldnt drive offended me
Alex Ernst is if Zach efron and bo burnham had a baby
They want to be comedians most out of anything if they want to joke about topics as they do. See it for what it is and don't take this shit serious, kids. Filmmaking comes in many forms
All jokes aside u n Alex working together r my fav now ❤
How did you get his voice for the Honey add?! Lmao
This collaboration was awesome so glad to see alex back
How does a video like this 40k?? Honest question..
Fuck YouTube, Jeff don’t need to be censored
Jeff and Alex are better than Jeff and Jonah. I SAID IT.
Ur apologize is crap like it says on ur mirror 😝
You spelled "apology" wrong.
Honestly, YouTube sucks for creators, buy Jeffs merch!! and he should really link his paypal cause his content is worth it
How the hell did this piece of trash cost 40k?😂
I am offended 😎 pls respond, my wife and kids left me, i need any form of communication ;/
Anyone else get the reference about him shooting his eye out with a BB gun 😂😂
This cost 40k to make?......
As a browns fan I’m disgusted by that Jets tree. As a fan of yours I’m disgusted by that Jets tree.
Yo I think I know the midget from Danny Duncan videos...👀👀    Waitttt, is Danny...
how did this cost 40k lmao.  it was a laugh, for sure, just sayin
There’s no way this shit cost 40k to make lmfao
Unban this man
When he was searching for join honey he had to blur his search history...
tell kiwan i say hi
Oh my gosh! That’s 11 1/2 minutes I’ll never get back again, I think my eyes are bleeding, LOL!
how missions in videogames be like
I watched this entire vid with a straight face
Just....no....no.....nooooooo! Why?! $40k?! It's not production quality your lacking, it's funny and entertaining content that's missing. Exhibit A: It's Always Sunny...
How tf did this cost 40k to make?
that Morgan Freeman ad at the start... seriously.. hypnotized me into watching this whole video. well done boys.
Idk how i found this but I’m so glad i did. This is a work of art
Liking and commenting to give this channel some support.
You lost me before the video actually even started. I had to watch two ads before the video then your video starts with a minute long ad
This cost over 40k to make? It’s enjoyable don’t get me wrong. It was hilarious and I liked it. I’m just curious where all the money went?
“I couldn’t believe my eye”😂
About fucking time
i’m offended.
im offended
I was offended by the women can’t drive cars joke
As someone who both lives in 2020 and was born by a human being that identifies as a female (actually they identify as a female attack helicopter and they served several tours in Uganda and are fluent in baba booey but that’s beside the point) I can say that I think I speak for everyone when I say that the absolute disgusting behavior I’ve seen is unacceptable. All the manspreading while he sits in the chair and all the cocaine everywhere and you question why it got taken down. To think that I hoped Jeff would never become a YouTube sellout completely shatters my soul. We need an APPOLOGY video next upload or else we summon the cancel culture and give you endless clout for our own pure enjoyment. (Disclaimer: this was a joke and if I offended you I will not be making a personalized appology but I will gladly send you pictures of Jeff’s secret narnia realm that he has hidden away in his closet)
I’m offended tbh
i’m offended
I am not offended. Keep up the good work.
this is brilliant
The eye injury should always be a mystery, given a different explanation as to what happened and even when telling the truth keep us questioning whether or not ur telling us the truth. Nice vid!
is that Alex?. he looks fat
What’s the name of the last track?
This was top notch need more Jeff Jeff
Nice to see Matt king make a special appearance 6:18
This is sensational
W
2:40 I’m offended.... where’s my apology?😂
apologize to me
I guess youtube got offended and instead of leaving a comment they just made it hidden.
👍
Morgan freeman!???..... Shaw shank Redemption flashes.
F THE Ai
Upset about it being blocked
im offended by the woman joke
ur name jeff
I missed alex
I love Alex sm
I find it odd they talk about the government or people spying on us via cameras and then he gets banned. I'm sorry that's odd
Sorry YouTube’s a lil bitch Jeff
I'm offended reeeee      This is a beautiful piece of art
I really hope they didn’t actually spend 40k on this video
Im offended , absolutely appalled !    Im jus looking for a response ;)
They ban your videos, but decide to recommend me the image saying its banned? In not subscribed or ever seen your videos before. It's a holiday miracle
I hate how they have to put a disclaimer for making a sexist joke, like ffs why are there so many snowflakes nowadays 💀
Boo YouTube
This what a 40k video look like
jeff im offended about the women cant drive joke now say something nice about me in the replies 😳
Amazing how you can be “banned” and still have 1M views on your video. Interesting how people have found a way to monetize crying wolf!
I’m offended by the missing of nerf
Jeff is underrated. Alex is just as underrated. And this duo!?!?! MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL OF US!!!!!!
beautiful
This video is amazing keep ot up
It’s so good to see Alex,  man I miss this dude
♥️
They really combined once upon a time in Hollywood, goodfellas, every Seth rogen, James Franco and Jonah hill movie ever made, and made it a fifteen minute YouTube vid
Alex can cart a legit tv show 100% he’s such a good actor. Jonah should take some tips from him
I’m offended now respond :)
alex and jschlatt have to work together
Guarantee this video got blocked because it mentions the plague twice in the first minute and a half. Pretty dumb reason to get blocked when I’m pretty sure the whole world knows we are having a plague by now but I bet that’s why.
The story gripped me right up to the point that Jeff went into the closet last but came out first. Really unnerved the whole plot. 😕
KEWON
Stopped watching when the hamster poster magically wasn’t ripped in half anymore
👍👌
What is Keewan doing there lmaaooo
You should have WAAAAY more views than this!
This was so amusing to watch and they are the perfect duo
I was offended
💀
🥳🥳🥳🥳
🌲🌲🎂
I’m offended
I'm offended
I wanted to let you know that there a video that constantly interrupts your ads.
I’m offended 😏
That's DEFINITELY NOT Morgan Freeman talking about Honey. Close impersonation but no cigar. Why is YouTube banning your videos? This wasn't age restricted btw
There's a sponsor and you need $$
Have I rewatched this 12 times...       Yes ( and that’s okay)
Lol what in the 1am AdultSwim time slot is goin on here???
2:43 don’t mind me just making a replay for myself
i'm offended that you actually had to put a disclaimer so you could apologize to  each person that took a joke serious..
LOVE
Please keep posting this if it gets deleted, it’s such a great video!!
Was taken down but I’m watching it right now?????🤷‍♂️
YouTube needs to sort there shit  out 😅
I knew those those weren’t normal cookies I ate for breakfast...
Am I on LSD?
I am OFFENDED😤
I feel like this was a little to close to the hitler cut😂
I’m offended
We need more of Alex
This is my favourite video of 2020
Wtf lol :)
I’m offended so pls respond
YT is controlled by tyrannical illiberal leftists. Nothing liberal or tolerant about them.
my guy got morgan freeman to do his ads
I’m offended
Looks like a Eminem want to be to me with a patch
Such a shame they’re blocking a great video
Hearing the begging, it sounds like they're going to make a Now You See Me 3.
I am extremely offended by the women jokes
What content was banned in the video, that triggered the overall ban? Too much action for the green or whatever hair color mods?
The women can’t drive joke offended me beyond belief. I haven’t been able to sleep for months because of it. How dare you! I want my personalized apology below. Thanks and Merry Christmas!
I'm offended
Did $30,000 of the budget go to Morgan Freeman reading your ad??
Top 10 anime crossovers
“Don’t ask about the eye.”  proceeds to ask him about eye lol
Beautiful!!!!!!
Ngl this video was really good
Why was this age restricted? Wth YouTube

I'm offended
Idk who you are but I saw that YouTube blocked your video that you spend 40k on so I’m here for ya

Not sure what the banning comments are about. I dont even follow this channel and the kid complaining about youtube blocking his vid came up on my feed
I'm offended at the joke. I take venmo and check deposits for apology money, thanks!
ah youtube being the morality police again... was it christmas that offended youtube? or the "missing dawg" poster in the beginning? or the joke about women? or the joke about the barber and unemployment? tongue my anus youtube i hope you go bankrupt
Wait a minute... if this video was banned.. how.. am I watching it?!?!?
This is the one that got age restricted?! Wtf... there is worse in typical ads on your own site YouTube...

It’s dumb how they have to put a disclaimer because of the joke
the duo I never knew I wanted, but now I need

I'm offended.
What do u mean it’s deleted? I see it fool
It sounds like Morgan Freeman
I haven’t seen Alex in soooo long ❤️ miss this guy

An 11 minute full movie more emotion than a most of the movies
What if... just here me out... what if it never got banned... what if they said it got banned to gain our interest and now we are here..🧐🤓 Geniuses!

Just watching it again to support Jeff

Im totally a woman and am totally offended by the women driving joke
Probably because you let out Gov't "secrets"...
This was awesome, i really enjoyed this.... even with them giving Matt King a cameo lol
This cost $40,000?
1000000/10 video
why would youtube ban this
How in the fuck did you spend $40k on this?  Clearly wasn’t spent on a script, tripods, or comedy.
remember lord of the flies? this is them now. feel old yet?
Anything with Alex is awesome 😎🔥😭😂
I’m offended
I’m offended please apologize at once 😉
This cost 40k to make?
Grade A stuff
This is funny lol
Love this! Idk what ppl are so offended for. Jeff doesnt need to apologize for a goddamn joke that literally everyone makes.
Commenting since it got blocked
That paranoia thing bout being paranoid bout the therapist is so true
I loved this . Best one yet!!!
thnaks for sharing
Why in the world would YouTube try and hide this from everyone in the searches?  in 12+ years on here , this doesn't even rank in the top 1 million as far as being offensive haha!   Great video Jeff and Alex , and Merry Christmas!

Giving it another watch and comment just to show support. It literally makes no sense how this could have been banned? Hate the pick and choose censorship on this platform.
Incredible.
I AM OFFENDEDDDEDED!!!
Love how it goes from "One eye piece of shit" to "one eye piece of crap".
хсъе
This was $40,000 dollars worth of effort?
No offended but I’d like an apology😂
I usually don't point out lines of dialogue, but the part where he says "I never learned how to whistle" struck me as pretty silly for some reason.
Jeff and Alex are meant to be bffs
I wanna know where and how they filmed the snow scene
This video saved my depressing Christmas
Alex is actually mad funny
You nailed the wrong dad’s daughter
Beautiful
Fuckk YouTube for making it hard to watch this was 🔥
The iconic duo i like
WHY IS THIS BLOCKED
I’m offended.. but I still loved the vid

😆😆😆😆🤣 can't stop laughing 😆 🤣 😂 💀 😄
What happened to your eye
One of the best ones honestly 😄❤️
I've only seen a couple of his videos at this point but that's more than enough to see that Wittek is just as much if not an even bigger asshole than the likes of Jake Paul and Ricegum...

Way to promote misogyny and religious intolerance at the sametime. Hope you get banned
Such a good video. YouTube really need to sort their shit out and get you monetised again
Liking this because you deserve it :) on 00:00 christmas day
This cost 40k? You should rethink how you waste money
Tell my why I knew it was gonna be Jonah in the cage
pretty cool how vlog squad has people from all over the country. New York, Minnesota, Florida, Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas. Idk what other state im missing.
Why did YouTube take this down? Is it because Alex asked about the eye?
Maybe it got banned cause MAYBE YOU STABBED SANTA LMFAO
It took 40k to make this?????
Jeff I am personally offended by that driving joke.
I feel offended! 2:43
Good shit, but how tf did this cost 40k?😂😂
Watching it a second time because it was banned
Alex Ernst made more Youtube content than David Dobrik this year. A weird year indeed.
I like the way yall dealt with Santa. Better safe than sorry 🤙
THIS GOT BANNED!?!?! This was amazing
why would it cost $40k to make this video? lol
Banned and age restricted are not the same thing.
Alex was perfect for the Christmas special
When are you guys gonna pitch a pilot to adult swim
Im offended
take the curse words out and it won't be restricted
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why can't I find this anywhere
Love this!! 🎄✨
“That’s the pig! Oink oink!” 😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YT: Perfectly sane video. Nothing out the ordi- Jeff: *Gang shanks Santa.* YT: HONEY BRING ME THE BAN HAMMER FROM THE CABINET!!
Best video of the year.
Im offended

I’m offended lol
Pls make more vids like this
I died laughing when they found Jonah
Thank you so much Jeff I needed to see him
Let’s all remember that this used to be a haircut show
@3:18 this why you get banned
I created a bot account just for you Jeff. Watched this 2 times along with ads. Fuck YouTube. You deserve so much more. I trust you and your team and will be looking forward for the next chapter. Lots of love Jeff, you are brilliant, creative and amazing. Keep the hard work going🤎
This was such a masterpiece
🤣 ridiculous
Jeff's BEST video to date! We're gonna need more Alex in the future!
Lmfao this is fantastic
That cleanup montage really felt like Christmas. Then you jokesters stabbed the santa and sent me into a laughing fit. Thank you. Hopefully youtube eases up on that ban or whatever it is.
i thought the bald lady was trevor wallace at first
That was terrible. I liked it.

Masterpiece
I’m offended
Jeff: video took $40k Oh cuz the MORGAN FREEMAN INTRO

I really Loved watching this
It was jonah for me 😭
Nah this video was top notch no kizzee
His videos are not being blocked it didn't cost that much to make it and this is just a ploy to get more clicks and likes if you can't see that your  Blind
I don’t understand why this was age restricted....
Hey Jeff ,  Don't know if you will read this. But I like your videos.Do you mind bringing guests of different persona's and give one of them a haircut on your show (like in Graham Norton show-maybe you can make haircutting a segment of your show-like giving haircut to only one who wins the lottery or some other segment) . I would like to see the trio :- Joel Hazer from youtube , Michael Reeves from offline tv, Hasanabi from twitch who famously and *sarcastically* said America deserves 7/11.
Alex is such a gentleman
Is that the homie Morgan freeman
Soo good. WTF YouTube
Should of used the 40k to hire some funny people
Amazing video fuck YouTube
i’m offended, jeff and alex.
Best intro of 2020
I really hope your lying about the 40k this is trash!
Greatest video of 2020

I'm offended (just to get a reply, lol)
I'm offended by the joke

Youtube wouldn't be able to handle the traffic generated by the Alex and Jeff collab. That's why they decided to ban it.

How’d this cost 40k?
top tier content
For some odd reason when I search Jeff Wittek on YouTube, this latest vid doesn't show up, the fatty one appears on top, why is that happening and I didn't get notified too, there's something wrong with YouTube.
Don't worry jeff, we will rewatch it every time you do a reupload
I’m offended
This is one of the best episodes yet
I mean this is a really good video
No wonder it was $40K video, just a Morgan Freeman intro 😭😂😂
Beats Die Hard for best Christmas movie

This is the most I’ve heard Alex talk... ever
i am offended
It’s funny how they put that little disclaimer but I can’t actually be offended because I literally can’t drive

Well
This duo is better than David and Liza.
Don’t stop making age restricted videos!!!!
I watched this. I had to watch it again to make sure that I actually watched it.
I just wanna thank everyone who begged Alex to come on this show I didn’t think Alex would’ve so I never pushed for it but this is absolutely perfect the exact comedic timing I thought it’d be
“Age restricted for no reason”
Morgan's voice is now replaying in my head over and over after this video
I am offended. You won’t reply
I love Alex so much, miss him on videos
This was a christmas miracle 🎄🎄🤶

1:45  "Who goes there ?"
This is amazing
I love this
Alex is a gem! I love his humor
i gave this video a like did you
Ay Im offended so comment
Conspiracy theory: Jeff lives in the magical world and that’s why he comes out of the closet in every vid
Why do I feel like every video jeff makes hes so close to coming out the closet
I’m sorry YouTube is banning this video from search. I think they’ve already blacklisted you since most of your content is not kid-friendly especially with your outtro song talking about sucking d
How did this piece of shit cost 40k to make
“Ahhh.. just kidding” serious face after laughter 😂😂
Jeff, you should make these types of videos more I think we would love it
Nice
I’m truly offended
You have one bad eye from being socked in the face and that’s all I hear from his mouth as he shamed fat people

OMGGGG
OMGGGG
I’m offended 2:49 I would like a deep apology as I know a woman and did not think that joke was funny. Even though that woman does not know how to drive.
Am confused it sounds like Morgan freeman but it’s either someone that sounds like him or it’s some sort of app that makes you sound like Morgan freeman
by far the best content you have EVER mace
this video is phenomenal
It’s a Christmas miracle. Lol. 🥰
Jeff & Alex making a video together. 😍😍

Good one Jeff from the youtube
As a woman who has hit 5 deer, gotten 10 speeding tickets, hit a parked vehicle, has ended up in a ditch 2 times and drove without insurance, I am OFFENDED.
Commenting for the algorithm because wtf why’d this piece of absolute art get blocked???
You spent 40k on this ?
This is freaking amazing!

yo why he dump the lacroix over like that lmao
That can’t be Morgan freeman...
Bruh i watched this high as fuck and it was a weird ass trip
Alex...Jeff?? Yea I’m clicking!
This is great
How is nobody talking about Morgan Freeman doing the ad read at the beginning?!... Bruh... how?
I’m offended that you guys made a joke about women driving cars
Great work jeff, really! Amazing content man.
incredible
You guys are so funny together, definitely should make more videos together
the best shit would be if they re created iconic movie scenes. Specially these two. Boys got good energy on camera
What happens now when the scientist try to leave narnia
hiiii just commenting to support
Can't quit youtube u got alot of fans
Hello I am offended thanks
feels like doing drugs
I swear I saw a longer version of this.. was it edited or removed and reposted?
So no one gonna talk about how they got Morgan freeman to do the sponsor promo?
Fuck the YouTube algorithm fr
This is the video that YouTube banned? What.. why? That makes no sense. All the other garbage on YouTube that people report and try to get taken down because they're actually bad and YouTube does nothing about it, but no YouTube thinks this should be banned. This video!? Am I watching the same video? Someone who works for YouTube must have it out for Jeff because this video is hilarious.
Love the content so funny
I’m offended
Who’s here after YouTube banned his video smh (Edit) Jeff I just wanna say if u see this that we believe in u and don’t get unmotivated to post, we’re here for u
Maybe morgan freeman is copywrite striking your videos 🤷‍♀️
This... this was really wonderful. I actually laughed out loud for real more than once
Jeff I hope your read this VERY VERY VERY CLEAR........................💩🚽
Amazing
we want jeff back
As a woman driving a car this offended me
Found it after shadow ban
It was demonatised because u said u threw acid in his face and there was some detailed noises when in fight. Obviously they are fake but youtube still has to be a pain
don’t care it’s blocked still amazing content.
I'm commenting for the second time on this video... because it deserves another comment
i’m offended
I’m offended by the joke about women n cars
i support anything Jeff does.
Hmmm the video is not blocked or anything in fact its monetized like wtf jeff
I’m offended
I felt very offended by that women can’t drive comment.  I’m shaking with rage right now.  I expect an apology immediately😂
Fuckin amazing video Jeff
Im offended
Best. Barbershop. Episode. Ever.
youtube sucks for banning these don't you understand perfection when you see it
Leveling up
This was great! Would be trending if YouTube had a clue...
I miss Alex. I’m so happy to see him here .happy holidays ~!!!
If you try to search Jeff and Alex barbershop nothing appears. Bunch of bull crap. Why is youtube restricting these videos without cause?!!!
What happened to the lost dawg
Im 4 minutes in ...... this shit is fucking brilliant
I love the two of you together so much!! This video was awesome btw!! Great job boys <3
How did u get morgan freeman to do the ad?
I remember seeing comments about how a Ilya and Jeff collab would be the best, and now we got it boys and girls. Merry Christler ❤️
I hope you guys kept those wanted posters on the pole so more people could add onto it lol
Fuck the bullshit Jeff. YouTube doesn’t care. You got a glass eye for crying out loud. Gem-Glass eyes matters
Certainly funny. How in the world did this cost 40k to make though?
I think i cried a little 🥲
4:37 reminded me of the magicians
I’m offended because my mom is a female
I wonder how Alex got his start?
Hey dude yeah im woman, and im offended

What do I have to do to be kidnapped by Vendela? She's stunning :D
Dude I missed alex and Jeff’s barbershop.... WHAT A COMBO
Alex: “that’s a pet chicken” 🤣
This was a sick episode Jeff!!   Only wish you could have utilized Nick into this skit a lot more than just a mutant pig man lmfao.

If these doesn’t get more views then all these stupid friend damilwho videos I’m done with YouTube
This is so fire 🔥😻

Best freaking Christmas present
i was offended
That women can’t drive joke was very offensive
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true .  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
this wasa a goddam masterpeice

Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen... Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!

BAILEY <3
The dryness of the jokes in the air is amazing, this is history
Alex back in a video is best Christmas I’ve ever received
This is the duo we have all been missing in our lives
This is a “wtf” video
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏🙏💐😄💝💝
this is so hilarious
I really loved this
I was offended
Only putting in offended so I get a response from you <3

When you begin to inquire into the whole movement of knowledge and see the limitations of knowledge, for knowledge is always the past and therefore, fragmentary. Is there a way of learning, which is not the constant accumulation of knowledge from which to act?

Y’all are overlooking the best joke in the video: “Just look at that hairless rodent” “And look at what it’s doing to that rat!”
This was the best installment to the chronicles of Narnia trilogy
This episode will go down in the history of episodes. The future has begun to be written, this piece of art will live on. Damn.
Alex somehow reminds me of Christian bale
iM oFfenDeD
Was that morgan freeman parody at strting of the video
So the puppy died
I can't believe they got Morgan Freeman to voice the ad!
production values on this pops
next thing we know jeff has a netflix show abt serial killer nd 1 eyed pirate christmas tales
Best video of this channel
One of the best episodes so far. Alex's humor mixed with Jeff's is next level. I love that Jeff can adapt and bounce off of anyone that sits in that chair. There hasn't been a single episode with legitimately bad chemistry. Jeff has a real talent.
It feels like a dream..if though I have not started watching the video yet...❤️😭
Who goes their 😑
Wasn't expecting to see Narnia in Jeff's Barbershop!
Best vids dude

Jeff you should remake this video and put Jason as crazy science doctor and Corina as Alex bunny :D and when you pass your "door" you should meet mike dress as be mr tumnus! that would be more funny! =)) and whe you show the rat u should put a photo with mat king =))
honestly Jeff, you need Alex in every video. you two are by far the best
Bro Jeff is surprisingly the most creative member of the squad
DAVID DOBRIK COULD NEVER TOP THIS
The way they can be so psychopatic and wholesome at the same time...
The description !!  Joe Vulpis: Assistant to the Assistant Editor 🤣

With that being said, tiniest blimp, most of the previous comment has nothing to do with you. I love and respect your content and don’t want it to go ANYWHERE. Truly one of the purest hearts. And the Alex feature is not only sentimental but very much needed

iconic duo

Never clicked on a youtube video so fast in my life
IM VERY VERY OFFENDED BY ALEX'S JOKE ABOUT WOMEN AND DRIVING!!!!!       where's my personalized apology :)

This is so fucking good
Funny
OK but are we gonna talk about how jeff managed to fit an entire forest into a barbershops closet
Jeff's best video so far.

No more filthy frank? No problem we got Jeff Wittek

Can we all agree that anything with Alex automatically becomes better by like 100%?!  This duo tho, didn’t think we needed it but so glad we got it
Brb I gotta go get fuckin' high as shit before I watch the rest of this video.
Jeff and Alex together? ✨powerful✨
It finally happened 2020 crazy
the most anticipated video in history.
Every time Alex is in a video you know it’s going to be good
I don’t know what I was expecting but it sure wasn’t all that
Loved this... we've all missed alex as well...and jeff honestly your scar only made you more handsome😜💖💖💖stay blessed and happy holidays yall😊
This is the collab that I have been waiting for since David's christmas video with them
This was Great! 🔥
This is my new favorite Christmas movie

best episode in a long time
Alex should be the co-host! Imagine!!
Tf did I just watch
Christmas tree
Lol Jeff.....I just got buzzed  sipping some wine helping Santa wrapping my sons gifts I definitely wasn’t expecting this lol I love it
Jeff wanted a red rider BB-gun for Christmas, they warned him “You’ll shoot your eye out kid”
This is like a fever dream
Great job guys, high quality content
Are we just going to ignore that fire song I’m the background from alex?
I'm going to nominate that for a B E T  Award
Weird. But funny. I do appreciate the movie type style & effort! 👌 Jeff is still hot,  1 eye or not.  Alex is hilarious always.
Thank you Jeff, for bringing Alex home
I'm offended

"I couldn't believe my eye"
So he went to Jeff’s house. H better go to David’s  trying to see that dynamic duo again
I’m a woman and I’m offended
Ohh my god it's Alex  Seeing him is like seeing Santa in Christmas and seeing politicians making sense
When Jeff's voiceover says, "I couldn't believe my eye." I lost it. This is a treasure.
Jonah becoming a pig reminded me of Tusk
Alex earns !
I’m offended by the joke. How rude
plz this needs so much views !¡

I’m offended and expect a response ASAP
Amazing .. must I say genius *I couldn't believe my eye* You two could honestly make a real movie

Day 2 of asking for Jeff to have Danny Duncan on the show
i thought it was gonna be nick and dom when the guy was wearing a face mask and we only saw the back of the girls head
wtf did I just watched
2:49 I’m offended
You guys exceeded our expectations. This should be a show on Netflix, YouTube is not the right platform for this.
i am offended
Jeff is truly a love❤
Umm i am offended
What happened to Alex haven’t seen him in David’s recent vlogs
Did not expect this, not complaining tho
New favorite Christmas movie

This is the best thing I have ever seen
Sounds like Morgan freeman but at the same time kinda doesn't
Jeff, you did a great job with this episode. Let me know if you want me to make better plots for your videos, better than these scumbags taking advantage of a nice guy like you. Im college educated, and ready to direct.
By far the best episode !!
THIS IS MY FAVORITE
Collab of the year
Im offended
Best one yet!! ❤️ Merry Christmas Jeff and Alex!
Alex needs to go on Broadway. It just needs to happen.
Now this episode was on another level

Jeff and Alex combo is pure gold
Seems more like a Halloween video than a Christmas video
Keewon?😂

Phycopath meets Sociopath

11:05 who else was surprised to see Conor and Kanye at the end
This is amazing. David could've done this with Alex but David ain't doin shit, so thank you Jeff
Damn the “Get Alex Ernst on the show imagine the humor” comments actually worked.
I had installed honey but after that masterpiece, i uninstalled it and then again installed it using code jeff
Im offended about the joke.          You said that u would give a personalized response if im offended by the joke. Plz iI need human interaction😥
This collab saved 2020
I just poop my pants hearing morgan freeman
This one was pretty cool lol
I’m offended
The joke didn't offend me but I'd like to find out what the message would be.
THE VIDEO WE HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR
Jeff’s content is what I like to watch without being disturbed by anyone

Ok Netflix hire the vlog squad ASAP ✌🏼❤️
One of the best thing that happened before this year ends

Alex reminds me of Leonard Snart from the flash
A cinematic masterpiece
Epic
Best duo out there

Can I just say story and editing wise I think this is your best video jeff and you should collab with alex more
im offended
This was genius
HAHHAHAHA IM OFFENDED
Enough to make a grown man cry
I hated this but in a good way
A typical alex style vid ...loved it 😂😂

This lived up to the hype
Love this 🔥
Alex is the dude man we really miss him
Im offended
I thought the bald girl was Durte Dom lmao
Missed Alex SOOO MUCH best duo really
Alex is the most undefeated vlog squad member
The crossover we didn’t know we needed
This is why we haven't seen Alex recently, he was acting in a movie...
Well made young man
Ahhhhh I missed alex so much
Alex my favorite killed it
Alex back bitchesssss
At the end. That clip of Alex eating the shaving cream hahahaha
Damn.. you really remind me of my best friend joey!
Incredible
this was insane
There will never be a better YouTube video than this. Truly amazing
I’m very offended by this women joke
My two favorite members of the blog squad collide
holy shit i thought he’d never get alex to come into the barbershop.... ITS A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE
Bailey is such a good actress!
I see Alex and Jeff in this.... I love seeing their influences come out in their art. 10/10
Lol ur vids r so funny
Best collab
"That's the pig" That's the pig. "Oink" Oink 🎶
alex is back
Missed Alex in videos
A duo that no one knew we needed
Both of them could be great writers.
I’m offended.
Alex should've stumbled first in the scene after running into the door, regardless this video is a beauty
I’m offended
My two favorite dry humored serial killer content creators.
Finally!!
As a Nascar driver and a mother of 12 I'm offended.
Seriously the summary of 2020... Alex needs to come back
Jeff and Alex are like brothers from different mothers. I fucking loved the awkward film of a collab
This year has been David losing his friends Nat to Todd, ilya to Joe, and Alex and Jonah to Jeff
NO GOD DAMN WAY
I watched the whole add😂
Me only commenting "im offended so that jeff will apoligize to me.
I’m offended. Now look me in eye and apologize to ME.
this is funny
lmao
I'm offended🤷🏽‍♀️
I loved thisssss
I’m offended ☹️
I am offended you took it as a joke and talked about it so lightly... a woman behind the wheel is a serious topic and a danger to all of society.
the effort
LMFAAOOOOO when jeff shoots the lock off and bounces back im cryinggggg
They made like 20 different movie references Lmaoo
100% adore, lmao
I was literally looking up “what happened to alex from david’s vlogs” yesterday
I feel the Alex & Jeff dynamic.
this was a great movie cried at the happy ending 🥺❤️
The chronic of Narnia... this did bring joy to a sad kid. Well grown man
Amazing piece of art
yo Jeff bro, I am extremely offended by the women and driving joke.  My mom is a woman.
People were saying for so long for Jeff and Alex to collab because they’re chemistry would be so good, and now they prolly became bffs
All the hype to have Alex on this show....u out did everyone's expectations...well done sir
Im offended
I really didn't know that jeff was such a good actor and movie director.... Awesome work...
it was alex's whistle for me HAHAHA
Best one yet ❤️
"Nerfy Dent"
I’m offended
i remember the first video i saw Alex in, how time flys
Alex first 11 minutes video
I knew when Alex was in this that some weird shit was gonna happen 😂😂
I missed Alex so much in videos
How many people audibly said “what the fuck” after all this was over?
Two weirdos who we love the most
lmaoo ofc it's mike who would be the one to get acid to the face
AMAZING COLLAB!!!!
Finally Alex and Jeff make another video together !!!!! Merry Christmas !!!!
6:24 this part is so funny to me idek why
This is the duo I didn't know I needed
Im not offended but if you can reply or like this it would make my day
almost cried
Jeff let me cut your hair
This one was pure gold, good job boys
These things are getting out of control 😂
I just lost a few brain cells watching this..... I LOVE IT
I was hoping this collab would happen Alex should be a regular on the show
I am offended at 2:45. Jeff, please apologize
Why is Morgan freeman whispering in my ear about honey??
Quality content right here!  David who..!??! Naww
Alex’s voice is great Sinatra vibes
This is so good, it’s unbelievable
We did it boysss
That woman driving comment truly disappointed and offended me. I thought better of you, Jeff.
you guys need to work together more😂
I’m offended
Literally the only 2 people I love from the “vlogsquad”
New favorite Christmas movie.
This is the best video I’ve ever watched
"She thinks it's going to interfere with her government unemployment "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀!!! Well done
Damn Alex is so underated man. Not only his comedy but his acting is spot on. If only he would upload more on his channel. Or collab more with the vlog squad. And don't get me started on Jeff. His dry humor and witty acting skill are finally getting somewhat of the recognition he deserves. Fucking amazing video. Had me laughing the whole time. Keep it up and collab with Alex more. The chemistry & different variations of your comedy between you two is flawless!
Everyone leave a hate comment rn.  He’s only gonna keep Alex around if we say we hate him, that’s how we got stuck with Jonah.
Bailey harambe!!!!
The crossover that we didn’t deserve but the one we needed
Hey I’m a woman and deeply insulted by the women joke(I’m a man) (I just want Jeff to write to me personally 🤑)
I’m offended jeff
I never clicked faster!! We miss Alex!!!
im offended i would like my apology.
Im offended
Amazing
Best episode ever ❤
it’s a christmas miracle!
los amo
This is a great collaboration from Jeff and Alex
Happy Christmas everyone 🙏💖🎄
Holy shit Jeff and Alex together is the best damn thing!
This is the Christmas Eve eve content I needed!
This episode was Trippe as hell😂.
Jeff PLEASE make Alex a regular on this show. He is so god damn funny and we can't get enough of him.
✨A cinematic experience✨
truly a Christmas miracle
This better than any Christmas movies
Best thing to happen all 2020
Man this has me happy for the holiday 🌟📸💎

Love the new type of content jeff, with storytelling and effort. Guess having one eye is helping you make better content.
Lmaooo😂😂😂😂 you're setting the bar real high🤣🤣
I used to be able to watch these shows out loud but this one might need sum head phones
this is insanely talented HOW did u do this
I’m offended

Honestly the best thing I've watched from any of the vlog squad this year. Thanks for saving Christmas Jess and Alex.
this doesnt concern to me, but my sister has a tough time believing she isnt an object..  because of the guys at her school saying she is just a women meant to serve men. Not being able to drive reminds me of that and it does hurt me.
“Give me your hand” 😂😂😂
Morgan ?!?
IM OFFENDED BIG MAD STOP....... this show ruins childrens lives with bad jokes
beautiful story <3
thank god jeff jumped on the vlog squad train before it went under because he seems to be the only one that still making good shit, and by good shit, i mean amazing shit

F yeh
Now this is better than any Christmas movie you’ll ever watch
collab of the yearrrrrr
I need more Alex. Especially angry Alex
Can't believe you got Vendela on. She's my fav Playboy model ever

This was so good wtf
More beefy boys Jeff. Its has all the elements of a top rated series. Buy loved this video also. 💪💪
Oh finally. The one we were waiting for. Alex and Jeff. Legit psychs of vlogsquad.
This is probably going to be the closet thing to “starring in a comedy movie” Jonah is ever going to come
get these guys a netflix series
Epic video👌
The collab we all needed
I am the sad kid that got happy w this vid
The worst thing about this video is that it was only 11 minutes long

Alex cleaning a mess instead of making a mess is 2020 in a nutshell.
Totally offended
Whatever expectations I had for Alex coming on the show were completely shattered. This is beautiful. Bailey is so big. I'm glad Alex and Jeff saved Christmas.

Jeff over here proving that you can put out videos of pure entertainment.. While David is off pretending that the pandemic is the reason he can't go back to vlogging smh.

I am offended
just remember that this is a show about cutting peoples hair
“I couldn’t believe my eye”

I genuinely laughed at this, you guys should make it into some kind of detective comedy series. Your humor works well together, and the writing is creative.
They gave us the mash up we didn’t know we needed!
I'm offended
I'm offended
the duo we never knew we needed
The wait was definitely worth it! Great episode.  Any way we can replace Jonah with Alex as the co-host? 😀😀.

I AM OFFENDED, I don’t know why but I am
What in the old spice did I just watch
it's Nartnia so trippie
You've offended me now I want my personalized apology
I’ve probably seen hundreds of honey ads on YouTube and I’ve never downloaded it, but hearing Morgan freeman telling me to join I might just have to
I didn’t know narnia got a sequel
Finally we got what we’ve been asking for. After all this time one magical video of the two of them together. And is his rabbits last name harambe?
Damn Jeff really said ‘Merry Christmas!’ With this one.
Cody Ko said he wants back on the show
Man your videos are so amazing unlike the others in the vlog squad and its more content driven that makes it special !!
shiet man this was dope
Hold up bruh is that fucking morgan freeman in the honey AD???
Jeff and Alex are the best friends that Joe and Ilya wish they could be
Can I say I’M OFFENDED by the statement of women shouldn’t drive cars? Bc I personally am offended by that..... Bc I’m an amazing driver... but women plural, F the rest, bc they can’t drive to save their own damn lives!  🙄🤣🤪
This video was ReaLy sh!tty, but you know what I still liked and subscribed👍🏼 and thats how I saved Christmas 🎄
i was not prepared for this cinematic masterpiece
Yes jeff
This was great
I LOVED IT!
I'm offended
I was very offended by the women can't drive joke Alex, Jeff, and everyone on the barbershop team. I hope next time you will think before you speak; on behalf of all women everywhere, not being able to drive is a sore spot.
A true masterpiece! I think I have found my new favourite holiday film
I’m offended about women joke
Alex is the funniest dude from vlog squad cause he’s an awkward comedian that just makes you say wtf same with jeff
Everyone's waiting for

Can wait to hear... "Aaaand the oscar goes to.....Jeff and Alex and their role in Christmas Evil the movie"

I’m EXTREMELY OFFENDED ABOUT THAT COMMENT.. how dare you criticize something I specialize in ?? Rude and disrespectful...I expect a tasteful apology for a reply, and maybe a Tesla lmao 🤣🤣 seriously though you should reply back
Kinda looks like Adam Nealy
No one’s appreciating the sheer immense quality that’s going on this episode! Well done, topped yourself Jeffery.
Watching Jeffs vids high are something everyone gotta experience
Everybody talking about the great conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter...this is the greatest conjunction of all time
this shit is actually next level wowww
ONG HE GOT ALEX!!!
Not that crap the other vlog squad members have been making
.                                                          ..................                                                                               ..................................                                                      .

Christmas is saved!!!
This video should be used as anthropic evidence that we are in the best universe.
The duo we all knew we needed! More Alex!
Wow what a unique episode
I feel like I just watched a movie
This seems pretty high budget for a barbershop show lol
where tf did jeff find snow in la lmao
This is pure art
Great Video Jeff
Alex is back baby
This was good more of Alex I miss him
I, as a woman who drives a car, am deeply offended.
I’m offended  Now pls write me an apology 😘
wow I smoked way too much weed before watching this
I’m telling my kids this was the Christmas movie I grew up on ❤️
Is Alex taller than Jeff ?
Alex does seem pretty crazy but I agree with him when he said he is too paranoid to see a therapist about being paranoid. I think I have had anxiety most of my life but now I’m too anxious to go to the doctor and get prescribed for the first time.
this wasn’t a jeff barbershop episode this was a fucking movie
This is the greatest collab of all time
Alex shold be a cohost
what a wholesome episode
Alex is the best member of the vlog squad period!
I didn't watch this yet but i already know its a top 3 episode
How about a regular episode with Alex now lol
Jeff is funnier and better than David and the whole vlog squad in every way.
Who goes there lmaooo
why u got a budget morgan freeman for ur intro
I love Alex🤣
ITS FINALLY HERE!
kewan

This was shit?
This for some reason gave me old Christmas Nickelodeon episode vibes lol

Jeff and Alex make a pretty good comedic duo😅😅😅

Omg that was so good!!!!
I’m offended

Now everybody can shut the fuck up and stop posting "imagine the humor" every fucking video. BTW....Morgan Freeman. Dope.
THIS IS WHAT I WANT YES JEFF YES
This was a missed opportunity to make matt the rat
the YouTube video that everyone wanted. It’s a Christmas miracle!
More more.more.more more
The return of Alex we all needed
I'm offended.
Hands down. The best episode of jeffs barber shop!
YESSSSSSSSS
I am offended and will be waiting and expecting my apology, thank you.
I love you
It really saddens me who no one knows who is narrating the beginning of the video
Best barbershop yet, the production is insane.
Best video of the month
im offended.
The only person who didn’t enjoy this video is Stephanie
i’m offended
Hello yes it’s me a woman and I am so offended you better apologize NOW!!!!!
I am personally offended that Jeff thinks women can’t drive, it’s such a misunderstanding because really we can’t park OR drive.
Saying women can’t drive cars is very misogynist! Not cool I used to love this show my pee pees in vacuum cleaner
I’m offended
Does anyone know the name of the song at the end about “waiting on  Christmas night”? Thanks in advance!
Bruh the got kewon 👏🏾😂
LMFAOOOOOO NAH it had me at the end when kanye and mcgregor had his merch
I feel like someone just fed me ket watchin that
I am offended. Give me a personalized apology
7:12 guess that angry mob was right about alex being a racist
Great video jeff
THIS A MASTER PIECE!!
I’m to high for this
Idk what I just watched, but I loved it
Instant Christmas Classic🎄🎁
Ok I knew it was going to be good when I saw it was Alex but good lord this did not disappoint
I’m not sure wth I just watched
Jeff “if you come on the Barbershop, we can do anything you want” Alex “Anything, you say?” This looks like a 2018 Alex throwback 🤣
Idk what I just watched but I liked it so...
I just wanted to say say I am a women, and I am offended Jeff. So I would like an apology. 😉
Idk Jeff figure it out bro
Morgan Freeman really makes you WANT to listen to an add
I want more! I want more!
Their chemistry is the best thing I’ve ever seen
They’re like young Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer.
He said look at that hairless rodent...yea look wat its doin to that RAT🤣🤣🤣 LMFAO!!
Best episode yet!  I was glued to the screen. Great job guys!!! Merry Christmas
Next level special effects in this one 💯 lol

Am I on drugs?
Everyone has been asking for this and it not only happened but it over delivered. Got tears in my eyes from laughing but also from the beautiful story that unfolded. Worth the wait. A true Christmas Miracle.
Aye Jeff you think you can cut my hair next Thursday around 3?
wow great now my christmas is saved
This video was awesome
Best episode yet.
Plot Twist  Jeff used Alex and Honey to have the studio cleaned and to decorate, he never cared about Pig Boy
Only an artificial nose was enough to turn Jonah into a man pig! xD
Is it ironic that jeff is sponsored by old spice a lot which tests products on animals? And Was this basically an ad to not get people to not buy products tested on animals?
okay hear me out; Jeff and Alex podcast
I am offended
I’m offended, I just want the reply
Wtf I saw this and thought it wasn’t real

This shit is crunchy af, but i still fucking love it
Less Jonah that was nice
You guys are so fucked to Jonah lol. I just imagine the conversation went, "Alright, Jonah can be in the video if he.....   Alex- "Wears a pig nose" Jeff- "AND SITS IN A CAGE SHIRTLESS!" Alex- "Uh, sure that too."
thank you for this present king
I’ve been waiting for a Jeff and Alex video since Jeff’s first barbershop vid
No way Jeff, Kaewon, Alex, Nick, Matt the Rat Ratt, and nerfin the same video. The masterpiece the world has been waiting for.

This is the weirdest fever dream i have ever witnessed
I've never felt so happy being so uncomfortable watching a youtube video lol .
I can't believe you guys found that Human/PIG Chimera!!!  I'm surprised they let you show a real chimera.
Who else forgot this was a haircut video 💀
Damn this shit kinda sucked
Such a powerful story, thank you for having the courage to share
I, as a non binary male, feel offended by the joke
This is by far the best youtube video I've seen ever
Nice
Damn it’s been a min since I saw Alex
Alex should be a famn movie star. Mans funny asf
Alex ending the video saying Merry Christmas all sweet then it just cuts to “I just wanna go to burning man and suck my own dick” 💀
I technically don't know if i identity as a man or women so i am offended by Alex's joke about women driving
Is that the danny duncan midget hahah
Jeff I am personally offended by that joke and I am a male. I would like a personalized apology. Thank you
This is some shit I would be entertained by if I was trippin on some drugs
I feel very offended.
Hi, im offended by the joke about women not being able to drive
dont watch this while ur high
So badass
The most dry humor I've ever witnessed. I'm totally here for it. I hope Alex will be in future videos. These two together are salt and pepper. We need a show dedicated both of them consistently.
Podcast between these 2 would be crazy
This video was 4 hours long and I’m offended.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I couln‘t believe it for a second. Alex and Jeffff!!!
Ok so this actually made my day a lotttt better...but no seriously WTF did i just watched
Episode i for sure know i've been waiting for.
This collab didn't only save Christmas it also saved 2020
I miss Alex
This was hilarious !!!!!!!!!! I want a full movie now lmaoo
Don’t act like we wouldn’t notice you putting the narnia scene in your video!
Was a watcher. Literally 30 seconds in and just paused because the effort made me subscribe
And when everyone thought 2020 was about to end it all, they reappeared ...
alex is literally the best and everyone who says otherwise is just stupid
Holy shit It’s Matt”the rat” King that was the funniest thing I have ever seen
The best Christmas movie of 2020
Didn't expect anything less from Alex 🤣🤣👏👏👏
The duo we needed
A series of Jeff almost loosing his other eye would be great
Bailey so big now lol
I want Jeff and Todds acting to collide, I know they've made appearances together but as them as main characters.
Narnia !!! 😂😂😂
My eye ACTUALLY got shot out by a bb gun .22 co2 pellet to be exact
LMFAOOO THE VIDEO WE ALL HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR!!! THANK YOU

I'm male and I'm offended
The best Christmas gift!!! The ultimate duo
I’m so happy. Thank you.
This was truly a masterpiece
This is maybe the best video I’ve seen all year
So much more than just a haircut
Duo we need
am offended now say sorry
ABOUT TIME THESE TWO GOT TOGETHER
jeff has the best humor cause u never expect it and when u realize it and always hits
Yo was that psych substance in the Santa outfit at 9:13?
im offended.
I’m offended by the women hair cutting comment. I am a woman and I used to give myself emo haircuts in 7th grade. I was the best emo. I loved my chemical romance, (three cheers for sweet revenge) I demand an apology.
I've been waiting for this episode for a while now :)
Merry Christmas!!💫
"Imagine their humor together"
Love how Kewon was is this😂😂
I love Jeff's videos, cuz u never know what to expect
Lmao, "Don't ask about the eye." "Yeah sure what happened?" Jeff starts too explain what happened 😂
The most anticipated crossover in history
This is so good
This is the best video on the internet
I’m offended.
Best story ever.
Finally its time my 2 favorite vlogsquad boys
im so offended
This is art
This is so creative 🔥🤩
Are we not gonna talk abt how Kewan is in this???
I can’t be the only one that was anticipating a Matt the Rat joke
With his sponsorship money and Alex's mind Jeff can finally churn out a half decent video. Too bad he still can't churn out a half-decent haircut.
Who would’ve thought Jeff and Alex were the best comedic duo
I like it
I’m offended
Im still so confused
i liked the video as soon as i saw alex in the title.
I'm offended
Alex is back!!
what in the Chronicles of Narnia did I just watch...
I'm offended, where is my personal apology?
what the fuck is this lol
Anyone else notice the old spice them tune 😂😂😂😂
I declare that I am offended
Jeff: "Don't ask about the eye" *millisecond later* Alex: "YEAH, what happened?"
Brother I thought 2020 couldn’t get any crazier it throws this curve ball.
This was fucking incredible
Yooooooooo I’ve missed Alex
Jeff: “Don’t ask about the eye”  Alex: “Yeah what happened”
Is that Gordan Freeman reading the intro?  That's epic
what the FUCK did i just watch?
Felt like I was on acid while watching this, don’t do drugs kids👍
Is no one gonna talk about Morgan Freeman’s voice in the beginning 😂
only thing i thought when i saw this video is that i dont have to see "BRING ALEX ERNST ON IMAGINE THEIR HUMOUR TOGETHER" copy and pasted on every video
good vid 9-10
Bravo👏🙌👏🙌
Love IT :D
this deserves more views
2:47 I am outraged. Offended. This is not funny! It’s just flat out rude and sexist!       aight now where’s my personalized apology, Jeff >:)

Now jeff can rest from the comments "get alex ernst on the barbershop 💈 "

im offended by alex ernst joke that women cant drive. dislike.
Alex for co host
THIS MUCH HUMOUR IN ONE VIDEO
My favorite one yet
I'm deeply offended with the women joke, as a man with a mom, I think that was totally uncalled for
I can't believe they got Morgan Freeman to narrate Jeff's ad for honey 😃👍
I'm not even gonna question this
Banger
This was the best we need more Jeff and Alex
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!
lmao i died when it was jonah was under the sheet
Is it weird that I knew it was Kewon before he was revealed? I’ve watched too much Danny Duncan vids.
Glad to see Alex again! This video is epic!
I'm offended
This was the best video Jeff has come out with yet. Clearly he spent dolo on it and it showed. And hopefully pays off
Wasent affended but would love a commet from you

I’m offended, give me a personalized apology.
I hope everyone has a great Christmas despite what's going on. I think this year has highlighted how important your close family is to you. This YouTube community will always be here for you.
Omg it’s Bailey Harambe Dobrick Ernst
The budget is either $0.25 or $25,000 and I honestly have no idea
Man you gotta do a Dexter Morgan type of episode now that would be a banger man it fits you!
Holy fuck finally

This is your netflixshow. Give him a bag!
Well that was awesome... Different, but awesome!
I'm extremely offended by the joke about women driving xx
life is good
F
Better than anything ive watched during quarantine,  That's huge
Top 3 episode Jeff, Merry Christmas!
He finally made a video with Alex
F
By far the best barbershop video
O
its a christmass miracle video!!
Jeff should direct movies
ALEX!!!!!
Wtf did I watch
Best video you ever did this is why I love Alex and Jeff 👏🏼👏🏼👑👑
For a second I thought it was noel miller in the lab
Kewon
You could add Alex Ernst's face in any thumbnail and it would get views.  What a god
Jeff!! This is amazing!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think I'm offended
10/10
I think it could be the midget mamba
You know its getting out of hand when I can find continuity errors 😂😂
alex gives off the vibes of a Minecraft streamer boy
Hilarious 🤣
Who else misses Alex?
I feel like im high as a kite everytime I watch one of these
"I couldn't believe my eye"
i am offended
The fact that these two men are so outdated that they hold the outdated view of women not being able to drive cars. In 2020? Is this a joke? If you're that disgusting go and live in some oppressive country such as Saudi Arabia. I'm sure they'd love people like you. I'm beyond offended.
You're Offended
What is this video
Imagine Dragons starts playing
By far the best person on the show so far. Alex is literally fantastic for this show. And an amazing episode overall. 10/10
fucking incredible 😍Christmas has single handily been saved in this single video 🔥
Legend bit
The best Christmas gift is a Jeff and Alex collab
What happened to Jeff’s eye🤔🤔
This has to be the most top shelf high class shiZ I’ve seen coming off YouTube in a good while.
I'm offended     Cause I want a personalized apology from Jeff 😂
Am I the only one who didn’t realize Alex was doing the voiceover in the beginning?
I’m so offended 😐 women can drive cars too
I would like my apology as promised 🤲
So...........what’s with the eye?
I'm offended
“I couldn’t believe my eye” 🤣🤣
I am a woman and I am offended
I'm offended
spellcheck gentlemen.. Come on!!
alex is psychologically in-sync with jeff's way of thinking that this is the only video that has jeff saying a disclaimer for a joke
Jeff puts so much effort in his videos and we love it
I’m offended and waiting for my personalized apology
What the fuck did I just watch
im so glad i am high while watching this
Did JONAH lose weight??
amazing video. and that bald chick is badddddddddddddd
best episode so far
Oh my gosh this episode is amazing 👏
Christmas is complete.
Morgan fucking Freeman, AND ALEX?!?!  FUCK YEAAA
I’m offended
This made me realise how much I miss David's vlogs and Alex
John wick and Alex ernst, the collab we didn't know we needed
jeff’s acting skills are on point
This video was just excellent
I’m offended
I cried when he said “that’s a pet chicken “ so powerful!
thought the bald girl was durte dom
Morgan Freeman really is everywhere. Man must be out of a job coz of Covid, good thing Jeff hired him
Wow watch this high I believe Jeff was very high while editing
I came here thinking I was going to watch a fight but I got fucking narnia
Actual gold
How does everything that alex touches become a fucking mysterious movie😂😂😂
This Netflix series just got a lot better
Tell me why Alex looks like Tobey Maguire?
How much was the budget for this???
OMG YES ALEX IS ONNNN
Glad u got Alex on the show
This basterds. they did it, they finally fucking did it. First we had the pewds with ksi and now, we have Alex and Jeff. Maybe 2020 wasn't such a bad year after all(it still sucks but got deam this made me happy and I still haven't started watching the video)
I’m offended
Im offended (jk just want my apology)
im wayy too high for this
Hold on is that dwarf scientist the same person who helped Dom "shoplift" that one time?
Don’t know what the fuck I just watched but I’m certainly not disappointed 😂
comedic gold
as a womin im offended #wantappology
This is the best episode that Jeff has put out. Hands make a clap for this
GOLD
This two man... Just pure gold. And yeah. Alex when is that movie coming?
You’re offended
Was that kewon from Danny’s vids?
Lmaoooo the best video 😹 feels like a damn fever dream
Dope episode. Gotta love Alex.
Can we talk about how this was the best chritsmas movie ive seen
This is so fucking good.     Edit: this is dogshit, but still so fucking good
Jeff gave us a present this Christmas Eve that we all wanted
I'm offended. Where is my apology? 🤣 imagine..
I thought big Nik was going to come out dressed as a centaur
This is already better than 2020 YouTube rewind
You should make a skit in a Martin Scorsese style. Like taxi driver or the wolf of Wall Street but an LA version
"hmm that's a pet chicken" 🤣💀
This is a true masterpiece. My eyes are tearing up
I smiled throughout this entire video! Well done!!
I was offended. Do I win? 2:48.
Alex is the most underrated youtuber!
Looool, the way I thought the dwarf was KSI for a hot minute 🤭
dreams do come true. merry christmas.
So you guys are bored, huh?
Naaaah, why’d you have to expose Edward Scissorhands like that?! 🤭🤣 and I can’t believe he’s white, I always thought he was Latino
I'm offended !!!! please make the apology out to Chad
This is so wholesome and heartwarming
I’m way too high for this
I knew I shouldn't have taken that acid
Lmaooo Kewon killed this bit. Jeff should collab with Danny Duncan. I think they’d vibe.
OMFG   "LOST DAWG" meme  immediately had me laugh out loud, dude  ersnt and jeff.   I'm so fkn excited to watch. I paused just to comment. the honey intro how they got that voice manipulation shit. Brilliant
“Hey man i just came for the hair cut maan”   Jeff: “shut up lemme play in the snow”
IM OFFENDED
I’ve been waiting for this for 14 hole years
best vid ever
"wHo gOeS tHeRe"
I’m offended
It finally came.
I'm actually offended from that joke
This is what the fans wanted and got it
“Go get your red rider”
I did not expect this  But I love it
HOLY SHIT FINALLY
I’m offended.
I’m offended.. 😂
I'm offended
This was Amazing!!!
Is no one talking about in the comments that Morgan freeman is in this bitch
Alarmingly wholesome
I thought Bailey died 3 years ago
Hello I am extremely offended by the so called “joke” about women drivers , please respond or I will proceed to freak out
Notice how the episode was 10/10 until jonah showed up. It is so annoying that Jeff took on Jonah. He has ruined so many videos he has created. Jonah has no comedic timing, can hold a roll, is so insecure his ego gets in the ways of shoots, and he had no taste for good content. Jeff has a metaphorical ball and chain on him dragging him down.
Fucking yes! This was great.
legit didn’t skip any part of the whole video
im a woman and im offended by your joke (im a man btw)
I’m offended.
No one makes better videos than Jeff
Bruh honey don’t work I’ve tried it dozens of times like everytime I buy something and I have never gotten anything off
That was Jeffing great
What a masterpiece! ♡ love from Wisconsin
They make a good Duo
Such a high quality video wtf
is that morgan freeman ????
I’m offended... by how good this episode was
I’m so offended about the woman comment
this did bring me joy
This is fuckin gold 💀☄️🏌🏻
Love It! My Two Favorites!!! ❤️ The Best From The Vlog Squad
I’m extremely offended
never fire your editor!!
THIS IS A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
I would never forget this collab, love them both
The collab video no one asked for 🙌🏼
you're offended (i want a personalized apology)
AHAHAHAHAHAAHHA WTF MAN 7:24
I'm offended
I think this video accurately describes this year as a whole.
This is the closest I felt to home in a long time..
Alex and jeff. Who would have thunk. Fucking gold. The commitment to the bits is unmatched.
I’m offended
Was Jonah playing NHL? lol
never seen Jeff break character so many times in one episode.
It sure is strange when the guest makes Jeff look like an average bloke
I hope this video gets MILLIONS of views
Hilarious. Had a good constant laugh thru the whole video . Nick with the pig nose knee slapper .😂🦕🦖🌏🪐💎💕💖✨☄️
I am offended
👍👍👍👍👍👍
I‘m offended
Idk what horse shit blunt I smoked but this episode was not what I was expecting
I'm offended and demand an apology

Christmas can't get better!
These keep getting better and better!!!

I am definitely offended, I am a woman and I am an excellent driver if I do say so my self thank you very much🙄😤
I’m a woman and I’m offended by your joke (I’m a man btw)
JEFF WHAT WAS THAT STUPID HONEY BULLSHIT AT THE BEGINNING
Wait theres a 2160p??
Did the "Co-Host" get slimmer or is it just me
Im offended 2:40
2:48 I’m not offended, but I would like for you to apologise for that spelling of Apology

I’m offended Jeff how dare you make fun of woman that can’t drive... you crazy one eyed piece of crap
This is my favorite Christmas special
Be honest should women be allowed to  drive cars Alex: well I never say they could  🤣🤣💀
Adventures of alex and jeff should be a thing.
Im offended Jeff
David never brings alex in his instagram story again because alex let seth use his instagramnaccount  live for dissing david?
Wow jonah's shirt at 9:39 i would like to know where you can buy such a illustrious piece of clothing. https://shirtz.cool/
Alex an Jeff, the two best fuckin comedians
2020 has been saved
Last christmas Alex and Jeff were fighting each other and this christmas they’re fighting together to save their pets.
Ahhh what a great story Jeff! Very clever & touching! I'm a animal lover,so it really got me when you lost Nerf. I knew how down & out you looked ( were) Loved seeing Alex! He's a handsome dude too,plus the two of you make a great combo. I loved when you guys opened your Barbershop closet & surprise! It was all snowy wonderland. But my heart broke for the scene where Bailey & Nerf & plenty other animals,using as testers"  for the mad lady scientist " work......You boys got in,like a Christmas miracle saved your animals. Incl pigman" poor Jonah! But,he kinda looked like Nikacado  Avacado sitting in there ex his hair was lighter colour  Excuse spelling,if I did that wrong.or a big 2020 baby.( think we're all feeling that not looking it) I never watch Nikacados content,nor is it my thing....EWEWEW 🥑🥑😝😝😝😝love avacadoes but the overeating makes me ill. ( Mukbangs) Anyways, Jeff, As always very well done enjoyable laughable video mate!!!! Ps just saying...you both look cute in Christmas sweaters!!! Loved this video the most bc of the action & the animals! Happy Christmas Jeff!!! This will likely be the last  video prior to Christmas. We're in the same boat I'm bipolar On   Meds so no drink  not even  grass !!! Chez bored
Am I still tripping on the acid I took  last night orrr
im offended by the woman joke i would like a formal apology jeff
I’m offended (I’m not I just want a reply as promised)
There's always something extra special about Jeff's Christmas specials. Last year he almost gave Scott alcohol poisoning. This year Jeff and Alex go to animal testing Narnia. And somehow it still makes sense.
A Christmas classic
7:16 yooo its kewon
I’m offended
It is getting too staged Jeff!!!!!!!!!!
So good
"I couldn't believe my eye" 🤭🤣😭 Edit: I'm going to hell for laughing at this so hard. Who's coming with me?
I'm offended
Im offended
I really enjoyed this. I love every episode. But this one was easily my favorite. Keep up the great content!
Jeff if you ever see this, I want you to know that your videos are amazing. All the work you put in is appreciated and I hope you enjoy the holidays.
im offended
Bailey Harambe Dobrik Jr hahahaha who remembers that
Wait not a single person has mentioned Morgan Freeman as the intro voice!!?!?!
*the way i gasped and clicked immediately after seeing alex*
I love everything about this.

Oh my god  ...

Does this mean I’m gonna be happy this Christmas
6:06 HAHAHAHA "I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYE"
I'm offended by the women driving joke
Omg, this is awesome!
Someone tell me the honey ad was voiced by an impressionist because if it is actually morgan freeman i will loose my shite
Love it
This duo is everything I needed in my life. Thank you

If alex and jeff did a podcast, 10/10 I’d listen. It’s so funny seeing them make each other laugh.

I hope to see Alex on Saturday Night Live someday he is perfect for it 😂
This is brilliant 😂
C.S. Lewis needs to stop ripping off Jeff's shit
“Well I never said they could” hahaha I am offended we women are excellent drivers 🤪
Most people: Marvel and DC have the best crossovers in the history of entertainment. Jeff: Hold my eye.
this is so well made!!! mad props
I’ve waited for this.
Can I have a job

This actually looks like a really high effort video.. Great job
Ugh I love Alex! Wish he did more videos with ppl!!

“I couldn’t believe my eye” 🤣
I had come to terms that this year there would be no vlog of Christmas decorating (smack down) at Alex's. Thank you both so much for the colab I literally needed. God bless you ❤❤❤
I don't know if this was filmed by Hollywood, Bollywood or Nollywood but it's god damn good.
Never clicked so fast in my life!!!!
Kewon💀
Can Giancarlo Esposito narrate everything now, please?
I wanted this duo for such a long time AND IT WAS GREAT
The classic they're right behind me aren't they

2020 isn't David's year. He gets Ilya stolen by Joe, and Alex by Jeff XD
This is literal gold😂😂😂
Yes
It’s crazy to think that YouTube isn’t this hard but but Jeff has honest accomplished so much in so little time compared to other Youtubers and I think he has a right to be cocky and have the attitude he has he’s know he’s the shit and I respect it
Wtf is this video
Quite possibly the dumbest thing I've ever watched. Loved it. 👌
That was so dumb I loved it so much
Lmaoo I LOVE ALEX !!!!!

Jeff this is the best video so far, have a merry Christmas and can you tell alex that I said that I wish him a merry Christmas too

seen alex, knew it was gonna be a banger. good job
When their joke about women driving is supposed to be ridiculous bc obviously women are allowed to drive it isn't the 1900s. But they were just allowed to drive in Saudi two years ago and I still haven't got a license bc it takes a year to get appointments lol. I'm not offended though it was obviously a joke. (Even though I literally had to write a paper on why women should NOT be allowed to drive for university when there were protests asking for it to be legal :) I never wrote that paper and got a zero on it lol)
Got dang it this was Gold! 😂
Yessssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!! Hell yeah you guys did it
I’m so personally offend and I am woman
I'm offended. I want my apology now...
currently passing away
