Whats wrong with these Asian Lads today? "Rappers". Don't they have any pride in their own culture? not even 0.00001%? Raf-Sappera looks weird. Is his Granny African? how can u promote his utter S.H.I.T.. .
this track is an ABSOLUTE BANGER ! Back to the 90s, lived a life there , came again to the present, avoids it
Used to have nightmares now I’m a dreamer ❄️
Everyone black and white danced together no problems back then 90’s vibe ❤️
VISUALS ARE HEAVY! BANGER
Just knocked me nan over with the subwoofer what a tune 👌 👏
🔥🙌🏼💕
Sick 🔥
True or false jaykae didn't need a feature on this? He should of done the whole song himself in my opinion 💯
What a music video 😅😧
Silky rides beats much better. Flow

Yessssss💯💥
Absolute stompah 💯
0:26 anyone recognise this jayz bar from ni**az in paris
What a shit song. Completely ruined a classic 90s dance song. And it's called Essex Girls, despite nothing to do with Essex girls, nor does the video have anything remotely to do with Essex or shot in Essex. It's shot in some random scum concrete jungle in London LMAO
if only i could find this song before they ruined it but cant find the 1990s one 😪
Awful timing!
Let’s be real he ain’t shooting no one. Batty crease
Jk went all Dizzy Rascal on us 🔥
What’s 50gs to a nigga like me can you please remind me. Bars so hot. Jay z niggas in Paris cated that bar mate
Best part of this track was the original chorus and beat 🤦‍♂️
Casually dropping an a Jay-Z bar and I can't remember where i heard the I'm dreaming bar 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️works though 💯
This been out months
Jaykae has peaked in music terms. Silky only getting started
Loving j's vibe atm
rude kid doing stuff like this?
🔥💯
Nothing new just same tunes over and over and over and over. Pop music at its finest, catchy beat that EVERYONE already knows. And some easy lyrics to remember for it to stay in ur head over and over. Makes the bag but just boring. ( my own personal opinion) 😁
🔥 i am a dreamer
Jaykae going next levels with his new tunes !!! Banger & banger !!! Love old tunes coming back out into 2022 🙌🏻🙌🏻  lively  another one 😱😍💃🏻 keep up good work 👏🏼🤞🏻
1:05 silky🔥
Hello I have something important to tell you   The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8
Jaykae where have you been?  😂This is pure 🔥
This is a banger 💯💯
Heavy tune wow

Dreamer is one of the best dance songs of the 90’s. It must have been on a thousand dance compilation CD’s 💿 many of which I owned! Still such a great song.
Some tune 💯💯💯💯
banger
nah...  sounds to much like the original wtf some kaeroke ting
Jaykae mad under appreciated.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Damn good track, although I remember the original 😳😶
Yoewwww
Bringing the Dreamer into 2022. Awesome
"From small heath I'm all for the blues." I'm not far or far from West brom thanks for doing us a favour against Luton today we moved a space up the championship without playing can't wait to wind my blue nose cousin kro fuck off

I was born 86, which makes me an 80's baby, 90's kid. I loved Dreamer back in the day and I listen to Jaykae a lot, but saying this is a "banger" is like saying Macdonald's make the best burgers... I swear people just read the comments and try to fit in
Goose bumps at 2.05
If only they had arena Essex for the track mad times there
A little bit mehh
Absolute banger
Fuking tune mate !!!!!!!!
