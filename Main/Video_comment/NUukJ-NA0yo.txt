we’re reunited🥳💘
22c and ana's in a black long sleeved polo top. I'd be sweating! Utter madness
The best theme park by far (that I think would be perfect for Atticus) is Drayton Manor. I have stunted growth and can't go on big rides myself and Drayton Manor is perfect!
I ❤ana
Reunited McDonald’s Mukbang!Anastasia Kingsnorth  love louis shirley
Go Southend
This is such a late comment, but I think Atticus would love chessington! it's great fun for everyone, highly recommend x
i love this family and Ana ur so amazing
Nuenue to her Different way hm her another way of that thinking feel for real hm off cellphone ah it been my way forget that.
Anna’s face when her mom takes the drink 😂😂😅
Her bump feel hm their but some
Hm you without shades her way ah.
Ah facial feeling soon to her forhead.
I'd go on rides with u ana hit me up xx try flamingo land with atticus some more smaller rides and a zoo
I ,Absolutely love that dress Julie wears x
Paultons Park is perfect for children around Atticus’ age
Awww Bless him
Love your videos with your family. They are natural and not silly
Man tv not drive stuff the fuck my eyes somewhere else not road.
I think a woman should want me with a think gosh not wrong stuff huh different laugh to not just that she sleep nette before shoot now here.
Only going up to 5th gear in a car with 6 gears 🙈 oh Julie lol 😂
Aww love seeing the family reunited x And atticus seems to have grown cant cope x
Coming from a fellow mini owner (mini or money pit both work) you will do more damage to your car by not using 6th gear than using it. I know they can be fragile beings but the gears there for a reason 🙂
Can we see this distorted mirror! I’m so interested now 🤣
Whos atticusis baby brother? Btw love your channel.
Haha your a funny bunch🤣💕
I hoped to see buying more stuff ...
What these folk now not to shoot just her with him but off cellphone can you have my white think.
You do realise it would be 10× better on fuel if you used the 6th gear. Especially on motorways
Atticus crying aw bless him 😂😂 dote
The fact that I got a Mini advert during the video :)
OMG Aticus has grownnn look at him 😱😱
The fat phobia in this video is horrible. Just lost me.
I DONT THINK her mum has many freinds or a job becouse she is willing to emmbarazz herself on the INTERNET
Missed these videos. Really not enjoying your content since you moved away. Doesn’t seem homely and authentic anymore :(
Loved this it felt like hanging about with you guys 🤍
Does atticus have a baby brother 🤣
so boring, honestly
Oakwood theme park is good!!
*wow!!!!🤤🤤*
I'm in Weymouth and I'm loving the reunitation with the drama queen and king
Her new car could be a Tesla!!
Sure it wasn’t anchovies in your salad not fish fins 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way Julie came to Ana’s apartment and started cleaning 🥺 she is just the cutest Mum! 🥰
The fatphobic conversation in this video is not really it for me. The way you are talking about thinking you’d put on weight through the mirrors is really problematic. You have a young & impressionable audience who will think that putting on weight is the worst thing in the world. I am also certain you will have plus size viewers that feel quite ostracised by that conversation.
Atticus has grown so much
Julie cleaning your apartment 🤣🤣
Drayton manor would be great for atticus x
what’s with the double chin
Love you x
Is anastasia pregnant because she had a blue and pink nails for a gender reveal?
Paultons Park is a good park for starter coasters too :)
Julie is hilarious 😂 I thought I was dramatic!
I love ana but everytime julie is in it I cant watch it, shes so annoying 🙄 very rude towards ana. She is exactly like a Karen 😏😏
Anna’s double chin tho 😭😭
If you’re fully comp on your own car you can drive any car you don’t have to be added to another persons insurance. I’m waiting on your new car vlog!!! 😍😍
Missed you guys 😁 haven’t watched in a minute!!
I'm really curious what she bleeped out 🤣
Yay what a rip-off
Is the plastic film maybe still on the mirror
The Best Trio 🥰💖
why does she look so bored lmao
Why are you acting American??
Atticus eating is honestly a whole mood 🤣😭😭😭😭
Great seeing you altogether again. Love your mum she's so funny and really sweet. Hope she's feeling OK lots of love to her and big hug. She can get out the other end. Xx
Damn 4 hash browns for a 7 year old plus pancakes carb overload
I love Ana but she’s such a cow to Julie 😭 her sarcasm is so irritating.
This is iconic ♥️
17:01 Ana's face and Julie saying it's going in the bin lmaooo had me in stitches hahahaha 😂😂😂😂
This is so cute!
MORE FOOL YOU FOR ALLOWING THE STATE TO DICTATE WHO YOU DO & DONT SEE...NOW EAT YOUR CORPORATE BURGER & BE A NICE LITTLE NON-QUESTIONING SYSTEM PLEASER ✌️🌍🙏
Slobs
lego land would be quite good for Atticus? ❤️
The tension in this video 😬😬😬
Reunited llamas
how much mcdonald’s do you acc eat ???
TURN IT UP. I've been waiting for this oneeeeeeee! So happy with the content she posts, makes my day. Xoxo
I really wanna see what the mirror looks like now🤣🤣🤣
Il take you out in a Lamborghini if you want 👍😂
OMG
I went to Chessington last weekend, it was an amazing time but the queues were very long. There are some good rides for 7-8 year olds, my sisters loved them and she is 8. There are also great rides for an older age as well! I would definitely recommend though. The safari hotel was great as you could eat breakfast while watching the giraffes eat there’s! 🥺❤️.  It was a truly great experience! xxx
Hi anastasia when's the next video x
I've missed julie and Atticus 💖 Atticus has grown up so much! Reminds me of my niece right little chatter box!
Your mum has been diagnosed with ocd and ocd can be debilitating for some please try and educate yourself and not be judgy towards her. I have had bad ocd for years and   attempted to end my life

Ana’s face when her mum took her drink😂
Aticus just vibing in the back
Anyone else trying to figure out what julies legs looked like?! 😂😂😂
I love looking at cars in the Alton towers car park😂 or just any huge car park tbh - free car showwww 😂🙏🏼
How has this chick got 1mil followers to watch her eat a Maccers?…
Asif ana doesn’t know anchovies come in ceaser salads😭
She tells she won't be eating McDonalds for a month, and after a week again back to mcd😂😂😂
Is she in a new car ???
Love these videos!
Omg wtf im glad anna moved out, imagining livin with them both, the mums annoying and he is just taking after the mum
OMG soo funny when he Realise the tooth fairy isn’t real 🤣
Anna did you try the BTS meal?
Julie .. I took my 8 year old for a super car driving experience in Hemel Hampstead last year and he got to be a passenger in 4 super cars while they did 5 high speed laps in each! Maybe that’s something to look into as my son had the best day of his life lol. It’s called ‘Drift limits’ xx

Back to your talentless best
Smile more ana! It doesn’t seem you are enjoying your family’s company as much as you used to
There seems some tension between julie and anna!? Anna seems off? 🙂
I LOVE JULIE SO MUCH SHES AMAZING
Gross. Their food should be served in a trough.
in aus it gets up to 47*c
When I got notification for this video I was so excited to watch it 🤌🏼❤️
Method glass cleaner will get rid of the fingerprints, without damaging the matte cupboard 🙂
I'll do anything for money.
the editing is just 😍😍😍
16:38 does atticus have a brother ?
Guess this is what youtube is now..
Love it 😘❤️
Why did I cry when I saw u with ur mum
Julie's looking great! I love her hair x.
It's Trypaphobia
the mirrors aren’t true mirrors hence why they distort you and make you look bigger, mirrors are the hardest thing to buy I think personally cause you don’t know it’s a true mirror until you take it out of the box and you’ve put it in your property xo
Now that I’m thinking of it anna kinda looks like Amy from the next step
what did he say at 11:14 haha
Glad to see your mum is doing okay!! 🤍🤍
What an entitled little brat.
It’s huge not hooge, talk properly Julie it’s so annoying
yasssss x
What does Atticus mean: "when we went to see my baby brother for one of the first times." ? Does he have a brother??
I bet Atticus gave you the biggest cuddle ever when he first see you 💗💗💗
Anna’s reaction when Julie takes the Starbucks drink to put in the bin 😂
The amount of ads in this... 🙄 good to see Julie and Atticus back!
Love Anna but if I never see a McDonalds vid for a long time I will be thrilled
Atticus when his face went really red and started crying aww ❤️❤️😂
Please do more videos with atticus 😎 I love him 🤣
Ana i love your family
Yess finally they are back!!! 😁
We love your mum ❤️
Use a magic cloth made by marigolds on your fridge it works incredible!!! Xx
Sooo who’s thingy? 😂
It’s going to make me laugh the mirror in anas room 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why she eating the food weird ana? 😂 half eating it separate haha
Yay 😍😍😍
Oh my god I work at Alton towers😭I work in resort box office! It would have been lovely to have met you🥲💞
Anyone else hear her say “alright Atticus thats a fuc..(king nough) hahaha
Julie seems so content with life we love to see it ❤️
May The Lord Bless Your Family❤
I smiled so much when I saw this I missed these videos so much <3
Yay !!! I’m
Love having Julie and Atticus back in the videos!❤️
Never been so excited for a reunion 🤣🤍
Sharks machines Utah machines machine machines Utah machines machine machines Utah machines machine machines Utah machines machine machines
It's so nice to see your family in a video again with you 💗❤️
Loved this so much! The trio is back 🤍💘
Atticus is just a copy and paste version of Julie! 😂 I love him lol
I just wanna guess that Anna is getting a Range Rover 🤟🏼
i missed your mum and atticuse in your vidios anna
Loved this video Ana, your family are so lovely . love how done to earth your mum is . Looking forward to the next video
He melts my heart! He's such a clever lil boy 🥲
I went to Alton Towers the other day! I loved it so so so much
Drayton manors a good in between one too!!
I can’t tell you how excited I was to see the title of this video!!
Ana, Julie and atticus’ videos are definitely my fav🥺
10:11  - Genuinely surprised that Atticus wasn’t offered a role on east Enders after that performance 🤣
Anna you are a legend for bringing your mum and atticus back to your channel
I also really recommend drateon mana me and my friends went there when I was 11 for my birthday and it’s amazing there is some small rides and ofc big ones. Love this vid btw xxxxx so nice to see you guys again
Atticus has grown up so fastttt
So with the mirror have you maybe got a plastic film on it and just not removed it when you first bought it 🤣😅xx
When they were taking about julies fear of fish reminds me of the video wear the fish tank leaked in their house from the exposing Snapchat video 😂 xx
YES YOUR MUM AND ATTICS YOU ARE A RIP OFF XXXX ANNA LOVE YOU AND LOVE YOUR CHANNEL SO MUCH XXXXX ❤❤❤❤❤
25 minutes of my only daily socialising right here and I’m not even mad bout it 😆
But Julie you're wearing a top covered in circles. Lol!
Omg anyone else think anas face looks a bit fatter, she’s got a double chin 😬
Did Anna get a new car
When I saw this vid my face went from 😐😊
Yay! Loved this! :) x
we have a mini hybrid;) theyre defo a thing haha xx
Atticus talking about Julie talking about her leg 🤣👁
Yes I have been waiting for this for ages I love this video I can’t wait to see more videos like this again this is my favourite channel I love you guys
Omg the INTRO IS AMAZING
Triple chin tc
Double chin
She thinks she’s so much better then every one else
Glad to know I’m not the only one with a fish phobia!! I thought I was the only one, can’t even stand gold fish💀 really Enjoyed this video💗
Haven’t seen these ppl in hot minute
We missed Julie and Atticus, I'm so glad that the family is back!! 😍😘🥰🤗❤💙xxx
I was watching some of youe old videos and you should do the "Eating foods with the first letter of our first name". They might have some new stuff and just a fun video to watcvh and possibly film
I love their chat about cars 🚗 LOL, great video Anna x
Hope there’s more vids with Julie and Atticus to come ? ☹️💕
These McDonald’s videos are just getting old but I just keep watching cause I love Ana
Missed these vids so much 😩💕💕
i bet you Anna’s getting a tesla
It’ll be a Range Rover like everyone else 😂💪🏼
'KNOCK KNOCK, MESS MESS'  is going to be playing in my head for a while 😂
Awesome video Anastasia xx ❤❤
I went to Chester
It can actually damage the car if you dont go up to 6th gear if it has one. You are technically cruising a gear lower than you need. It also uses more petrol/diesel as its less efficient.
Knock knock mess mess knock knock mess mess - 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 classic!!
Ana is gorggg 😘🤩🥰😍
Awwwh the family is reunited!! The video I've been waiting for x 🥰😘❤
Everything is a secret lol I just CANNNTTTT I wanna know ur car haha
Just realising how much I've missed seeing them both in your videos 🥺🥺
The best trio😭😭
Wished you could have vlog Julie in Anna new home lol
Julie Christmas sorted, Lamborghini race track day, you get it for Atticus when he is 10 😊
#Anastasiakingsnorth i like the mukbang videos
Wait what attics has a brother
You should take Atticus to crealy in Devon, think he would love it xx
Deffo a standard Range Rover on lease
Aticus is so cute!💘
Anyone know where anna’s top is from pls drop a link 😍😍
I went to flamingo land for the week off from school and i queued for 3 hours to get on the ride mumbo jumbo and i wont lie i think that queue nearly killed me 😩😩😂
Omg I’ve missed Julie 😭
Anna i love you so much! But i got half way through this and had to turn it off
Atticus would love Southend . I’m not a huge rollercoaster lover . But I love the crocodile coaster there.
Atticus is sooo funny its hilarious 💀😭
‘knock knock mess mess’ lolz
Julie referring to tripaphobia 🤢
Oh I’ve missed atticus 🥺
7:23 who’s car 👀
gullivers world would be a great theme park for Atticus :) x
ATTICUS😂😂
Wow omg this family is so iconic and I love how Julie talked about cleaning ana’s house as soon as she comes in
I think your new editor used his picture at the beginning of the video 😬😬
Aww nice you got to see your mum and Atticus again 😊 Hows your mum doing 🤔
You live in the same apartment as Rosie and Harry
When you clean your apartment just for your mum to clean it when she comes in
But why does ana eat her McMuffin like that ? Must be so dry
honestly theses are my favourite type of videos 💖
I've been bindge watching these sorts of view and as soon as this notification came up I full on jumped up and down I was so excited 😂😂😂😁😁😆😆
What happened to your invisaline ??
Hahah Julie 6th gear is actually better as the car is reving less 😊
atticus is back = im back
What a ripoff no tacobell
I wish Julie and atticus had their own channel, actually miss them ❤️
I love cars I want either A Toyota Shark and Sassexi swift or Lexus Hybrid,  Toyato hybrid
Good
I’ve been in a lambo and a Ferrari
Clusterphobia Julie, I have that to 🤢 lol. Not entirely sure how you spell it
Never clicked so fast
is no one else talking about the fact that atticus has a baby brother like when did i miss this chapter !?
I love that she’s british 😭🥺
I can see Anna driving a Jeep or a Range Rover 😍 I am so excited for the car you are getting!
Atticus might like Legoland too! They have some good in between rides !
I have phobia of fish
Poor Aticus when he got his ankle stuck in the door .
Not sure if its the black top you have on but it looks like you habe put weight on in ur face but u still look pretty
Why doesn't Atticus have a yt yet?
i like big cars too but i’m tiny and don’t even drive 😅
10:20
Okay but like you don’t even understand my excitement for this video
NOO ANAS FACE AFTER HER MUM TOOK HER DRINK I CANT 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Just a suggestion..I think u should go drayton manor as they have got perfect rollercoaster for Atticus's age and more scarier rollercoasters.. they have got MANY good rides including Thomas Land and a train ride through the park
He has such high adhd energy 😂 I love atticus
Who wants to eat Mcdonald here?🙋🏼‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋 👇
Im not even joking as soon as I saw this video I started dancing :D
Hi Anna nice to see you reunited with your mum and atticus 😘😘😘😍❤❤❤
Omg I cant wait for this!!! 😍
Yes yes yes yes yes to this!! 😍😍😍
My favourite trio
I’m howling at Julie saying she hates circle patterns but is wearing circle patterns 😂😂😂
it was a absolute VIOLATION for ana to keep in that video of atticus crying in the video 😭💞
The jump cuts in the middle of a conversation 🥺 great video though xxxxxx
wow have i missed this
Miss your old hair blonde. No offence your hair I think it’s a bit too dark it feels weird you always leave your hair down. You should tie it back more often. I understand it’s your business.
A Family Vid with Anna’s new intro and layout is everything! The old meeting the new 🥳
Can’t describe the feeling this has given me 😭
Anna you should wear your Gucci black bag again and other brand bags! You used to wear in the past.
Love Anna and her family, so close knit. Especially her mumma 😘 Atticus makes me laugh bless him. So proud Anna how your channels are growing, keep them coming xx 😘
Atticus should go to paultons park! Ive been there a couple of times when i was younger and although its a bit of a trip it would be good for atticus!
Happy pride month yall! Also atticus has been missed. xx
Go Drayton manor it’s probs a little far for you but it would be perfect for atticus
Julie cleaning anas fridge and bathroom sinks and lifting the coffee filters up cracks me up 🤣🤣
5:59 Atticusss why u exposingg Julie??? 🤣🤣💕
Love this like always x
AAAA THERE BACK 🥺💓
I wanna know what her mums leg looked like 😂😂😂
Ana you are literally becoming my favourite YouTuber. So consistent and creative with your video content. This one is such a heart warming one with Julie and Atticus reunited. Loveee it 💜💙
You should take him to Blackpool pleasure Beach its the best place for him to go if you guys want to try to go on bugger rides than cebebies and that
Really nice good to watching
Omg he’s 7 already 🥺🥺
Atticus: look what I found in the back of the car ana’s drink  Julie: takes it that’s going over there for the bin  ana: 😐
Great video
Nice Video. Also it was funny when your mum just took the bottle out of your hand
Yay so iconic💖

I found glass cleaner worked well with a cloth on those kitchen cupboards!
Yayyy their finally reunited 🥰🥰🥰

I think Anna is getting a range rover but idk that's just my guess
I’m in the in-between age and I love chesington so I’m going in august :)

Draton Manor is amazing for ages like accticus's age
Aww ana your mum is so cute when she says huge I love it haha "hooj"

I MISSED THIS AAHHAHAHAHHA
I SAW THE THUMBNAIL AND I LITERALLY JUMPED OUT OF MY SEAT AHHHHHHHHHHH
My mum does the same when she comes to mine. She always cleans when it's Already clean 😂 Glad it wasn't just my mum 😂
omg me& you literally eat the sausage and egg McMuffin the same I literally get no egg then take away the bottom bit of the muffin because it’s too much bread
Love Atticus and Julie
Atticus is so funny 😂😂😂
I love this video! I am so excited for the alton Towers vlog. I am so happy you r reunited with your loved ones and remember your family is more important than your fans so don’t feel pressured when you are spending quality time with your family to upload on YouTube! Love you ♡︎ and you are my biggest inspiration
Love this so much and Atticus really is main character here 🥰😭
