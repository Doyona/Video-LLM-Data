1:41 so you don't have to watch the sponsor
I need a medieval expansion pack that has pet dragons
wow!!!
PLEASE MAKE A MINI GOLF COURSE.
18:47 STUDY URNNN!!!!
i know you barely touched on it, but i still think a mini golf course would be a great game pack! i would want each of the holes to be their own items with different animations and you can place them wherever you want on the lot! (it would also be nice to have the option to choose each item's number, so the sims visit them in the right order) have the games function sort of like bowling, and give you options for how many holes each game is. they could make a few that are big and elaborate (a castle, a windmill, a pirate ship, etc) and a few that are sorta basic shapes to fill out the middle. i can see it being super fun for kids, maybe having special moodlets for teens depending on their traits (some love it, and others think its dumb. some secretly enjoy it even if they complain that today's family trip is LAME).  it would be a great opportunity to add more landscaping and fountain items, as well as some retail clothes for the workers. some more fair foods maybe? ooh it would also be cool if like bowling, they all had a blacklight/neon mode. i've been to indoor blacklight mini golf and it was awesome!   where i live, our biggest mini golf place is also an arcade, and during the summer they've got a water park. it would be cool to have it either be *just* a mini golf course (new lot type) or run it with multiple activities (like play arcade games, eat fair foods, use water slides from adventure awaits, etc) in businesses and hobbies.
I had to pause at knight manager because I was laughing too hard.
19:10 in the library :D
Now make a VERY BIG castle for the Victorians, statues, moss, abandoned, centuries ago vibes. 😀
they missed the perfect chance to make a little seance corner in one of the small circle rooms 😂
What is this a cast for arts? It needs to be at least 10 times bigger.
Antipode car plug use the app to pick up from a range of branch and street locations dn you can choose from a range of sizes
Okay, watching a bunch of these back makes me want standing toilet paper holders in addition to all the wall ones.
I dont know if you will do this but I dare you to make a 3 story house that takes up the whole plot
Perfect home for an Ornamental Hermit sim.
Make a castle thats all your most hated color
12:49  well actually the thing you said was today at the beginning 🤓👆
" She was a fairy "... "She was a WITCH!" Has me cackling!!
0:28 We pulled out our air uo at the same time 😭🙏
AS SOON as she said porcupine I was like PORTCULLIS-my random fantasy architecture knowledge finally comes in handy
13:33  "WAIT When, was! charcuterie invented??"  Charcuterie was invented in 15th century France. The term "charcuterie" comes from the French words "chair" (flesh) and "cuit" (cooked). It refers to the practice of preparing and selling cured meats, a method developed to preserve food before refrigeration.   "Ok.."  "Sooo Yes!"  while the practice of preserving and curing meat goes back centuries, the term "charcuterie" and the specialized craft of charcutiers, as we know it, was developed in 15th-century France. Charcuterie, meaning "cooked flesh" in French, refers to cured and cooked meat products. The concept of charcuterie is rooted in the desire to preserve meat before refrigeration, using techniques like salting, smoking, and drying.   "Thanks Google!!"
i want to hear a twilight joke
Welp 😂 time to re-read twilight.. again..
Charcuterie was originated in France during the 15th century. It was a way of preserving meats before refrigerating was common.
C&C rocks and ruins
i want relaxing rain castle building asmr
as a witch-  1- I very much approve of this build. 10/10 would DIE to live in (im pretending im not disabled ok) 2- the one-tile balcony thing would 100% be used for charging crystals and making moon water!!!!! (and sun water on Litha) (and watching the sun rise on the summer solstice) (and watching the moon rise on the winter solstice) (and having a picnic and making sun tea and celebrating and evrything muahahah)
Urn is in the library!
I absolutely LOST IT at “there are now FOUR sources of fire in this room”😂
You should start creating the people who would live in builds you do that have certain themes 🗣
A house were a vampire and werewolf couple live (you can take out couple part if need be)
in medieval france charcuterie was a thing🙏
14:00 you know what else is massive?
It's 2025 and I still want the twilight jokes 😂😂😂❤
im watching this again after buying the kit and the bottom level looks like mickey mouse toast or a mickey mouse ear hat
'porcupines??' *killed* me 😂
Watching the terrible twilight jokes in 2025 😂 love them
I know where the urn is. 📚
1:24 not the walebert 😭😭

"The chandelier of a killer, Bella" had me laughing so hard 😂😂😂
What pack lets you coose tiny home, big home, ect?
Now I wanna see a big castle!!! this was so cute!
I actually loved the rain in the background!
CON YOU RAE WONG ABOUT THE........... charcuterie board!!!!!!
The exchange at 17:40 made me cackle! Your energy reminds me of the antics my sister and I get up to. Sisters are the best <3
I always wanna hear a twilight joke lol 😂
i NEED a bigger castle whenever you’re in your castley mood next, for our now fully grown witch. i’ve done a whole life for her on my own but im not good at building castles and i want to expand and make a legacy
😊
Now do a BIG castle
They always make jokes about the barrel trash can but they use it in so many builds
Would we do a BRIDGERTON HOUSE?
YALL SHOULD MAKE A MALL
I found you guys on instagram and now I’m OBSESSED 🥹
16:19  I can’t believe Caryn & Connie predicted the “WIIIIITCH” trend
0:58 That right there is true sibling behavioir
its funny you say rocks and ruins sounds like a novel,, because ive read a series that's called ROT and ruin lol.  it's like a teenage level zombie novel
i have the feeling Connie is drunk in this video
now do it base game jk jk love it
1:24 WHALEBERT
I wanted a dungeonnnn😖😢🥺
WE NEED MORE CASTLE BUILDS!! 🏰🏰 MORE WHIMSY!! 🏰🏰
I like the joke about twilight!
The tiny dragon is base game??? Ack it's so cute, I'm gonna need to put it in every house I play
This build has McMansion vibes 😅
"medieval accent" = just saying it louder and slightly weird 😆
“You’re never fully dressed without your sword”WAS THAT A HAZBIN REFERENCE!!!
You could have used hay in the bathroom.
14:39 they called it
I would love to see someone add a basement dungeon!
THE KNIGHT MANAGER!!! 😁🥰
The bathroom plant leaves literally being IN the flames 😂
i'm sick and just rewatching all of your videos right now
New to the channel, and can I just say how much I love your banter? I feel like we're just all buds hanging out and goofing around together 😊 your builds are cozy, but your vibes are even cozier
“She was a witch!!” Had me dead😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The libary i win wheres waldo
14:55 "EHHHHHHH!!!"
"This is the chanelier of a killer bella" im CACKLING
rewatching this after the massive swatch update just knowing they're going to use every swatch of the base game books in one build soon
They seem so happy, it's great to watch sisters just enjoying life. I miss my older sis when I watch these videos
The strangerville windows go great with this kit
I am EXTREMELY late to the party but I just had to say… THANK YOU FOR THE HILARIOUS TWILIGHT REFERENCE JOKES! Hahaha put a big smile on my face. “This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella!” I almost spit out my drink! Love you two! 🫶🏼
Rewatching this in September 2024 and realizing they predicted the aniversary swatch update 😮😮
"imagine if they did a swatch update for the tenth anniversary" 👀
Isn’t air up just for people who are obsessed with soda and they can’t handle drinking water normally
"Charcuterie, on the other hand, is a more recent invention—relatively speaking—having been invented in 15th century France" From some website Google found. So technically you're still correct! MEDIEVAL!! =D (15th Century means in the 1400's, yeah, it makes no sense to me either.)
I'm here for the twilight joke 🤣
The urns in the libary,office.
I don't breathe when I drink water :(
NOW DO BiG CASTLE!
can’t believe y’all predicted the 10th anniversary swatch update 😂
"This is a chandelier of a killer Bella!" - Just died<3
Not EA announcing new base game searches for the 10 year sims 4/25 years of the sims anniversary after you two mentioned it 😅
14:31 This aged extremely well! 😂
You should have done a bridge between the circular pillars. I love you guys so much ❤😁😁😁😁😁☺️☺️☺️☺️🥰🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
18:45 URNNNNNNN

This is me before watching the video hoping there is no urn😁
In the library
I will do 5 jumping jacks every like this comment gets  Edit: first five done  All done for now sorry didnt remember

Mini golf course omg. PLEASE. Only you guys could do that. Only you. Could make it what it would deserve to be.
18:46 how curious, a dragon, a treasure, and an urn of the people who tried to steal the treasure.
Suggestion: change the channel name to Twims.
We need a Whaleburt castle
I looked it up yall, Charcuterie was originated in the form that we know of today in 15th century France. Though there are similar things dating way back to the Romans and the Greeks by a different name.
There is never a bad time for a twilight joke or two, even in 2024!
13:30 “The practice of charcuterie dates back to ancient times” got it straight from Google👍🏼
It may be a bit too niche, but maybe a house with rooms themed after dnd classes?
Okay! But how can I be friends with ya’ll!?! I came for the builds but stay for the pure belly laughs! ❤❤
WHALEBERT 1:26
this is the chandelier of a killer bella made me snort laugh xD
At 9:13
the small screach from the idea of a tiny drafon guarding its tiny treasures is something I relate to on a spiritual level
"this is the chandelier of a killer bella" MORE we want MORE! <3
This build is so incredible 😭
Omg this is literally the cutest castle ever I wanna live here!!
15:58 the fact im reading the twilight books right now

day 9 of asking for a candy themed trailer park/residential rental
I actually did love the rain is there a way if ypu do add it its more hearable and your voices lower so it matches 😅
14:26 no human being would stack books like this :-)
What about an "everything is not what it seems" challenge? Where you try to use as many things for something that is not their intended use, have hidden rooms, secret gardens, etc.
"This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella" hahahahah
Waiting on the hexagonal room only build
Just so people know air up does not work for the majority of people and is vary expensive so I wouldn't recommend  but i you something similar cirkul is better although it still has vary mixed reviews.
Rocks and Ruins An archeologist who falls through a dimentional gate while exploring some ruins and lands in the fay worlds version of the ruins
I most definitely want a twilight joke in 2024 😂

Teasing Whaleberg in the ad read was cruel. Whalebreg zootopia when???
Urn in the library?
15:57 here for it
I don't understand this pack. It's only use it to build a shell. Why bother?
Maybe do an underwater build
quick question how do you do the tour mode i see it in all of your vids and i want to try it myself thanks for making amazing content
I looked it up, and I think yes, charcuterie was invented in the medieval period (if I'm wrong someone correct me)
Whalebert always makes an appearance… 1:23
Make a house for wilbert plssss ❤
The urns in the library
Okay but "This is the chandelier of killer, Bella" absolutely _SENT_ ME 💀💀
Was anyone else trying to wipe away that dot at 10:51?    Just me?  Ok
You guys should've added one more circle room for an astronomy tower😊
I spotted that whalebert…
Okay, but I love this! I would absolutely love for you two to just straight up make your dream house.
Did anyone else see the whale Bert on the screen when they were doing the air up sponsorship
no one talking about the whalebur cameo in the sponser ?
Urn in the booknook
URRRRNNNNNNN
You should do a 1 MILLION DOLLAR CASTLE CHALLENGE 😏
there was a trend of making fake ruins called follies around noble homes for a while, so the ruins in the build are very on trend
No urn ????
WHALEBERT IN THE SPONSOR VID
+Ultra :M : what are they going to do with a square??? is one of my favorite drunken parts of placing this build X,D. First Carynand Connie build placing <3 I cant wait to fill up new crest<333 {=^-^=}}

Yes, you can definitely kill two birds with an oven hood 10:43

I saw the urn as soon as it popped on screen 😂
"... porcupines...?"  *DYING IN BACKGROUND*
I just got an idea! You know the books that you can stack on top of each other? You can use it as a custom pillar! 😃 I think it'll be a cool pillar :)
15:42 "You're never fully dressed without your swords"
Toilet paper!!! Now!!!!!
I want to scream that you MISSED. THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR _CHESS._
Personally I’d watch a million more castle builds.
Are you kidding me?! AirUp really is everywhere :/
Not Caryn building a box house with whalebert on top to annoy Connie during the video sponsor 😂
Contrary Cary and Connie!
OMG PASTEL POP CASTLE PASTEL POP CASTLE WE NEED IT IT WOULD BE SO CUTE AND WIMSY ❤ LIKE A TEEN WHO IS RICH (from herself) AND SHE RENOVATED A DINGY CASTLE AND SHES AN ARTIST SHE CAN BE FRIENDS WITH THE 2 FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN THE A APARTMENT FROM YOUR ABC APARTMENTS      I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
is it crazy that I really really really want a big castle, like with a dungeon and a ballroom and a secret room behind a bookshelf or OMG what about a belle sized library
URN IN THE LIBRARY
We absolutely want to hear the twilight reference 🐀 🐁
love them but it bothers me sm when they put shelves over windows 😩
WATER PARK WATER PARK WATER PARK
The Asmr joke was so funny because I use these videos as bg noise when I’m working on art
I know this came out a month ago, but I did indeed find the urn. 👵🏼
You should do one where one of you picks an item or items in the room and the other has to complete the room styled around the item or items already in it
Twilight jokes are always welcome! ✨🩸😈
I mean, without even looking, we all know the urn has to be on the library shelves.
the urn is at 18:45 on the bottom shelf for anyone wondering :)
I for one throughly enjoy 2024 twilight jokes
swear to God did they just say SAR-cotery .PS I know I spelt it wrong
You should make a big castle with a throne room and a dungeon and have like a royal family.
I FOUND THE UUUUUURN!!! That gave me a lot more dopamine than I think it should have....
16:00 YES WE WANT TO HEAR TWILIGHT JOKES IN 2024 PLEASE
The way I have been binging y’all’s videos is hilarious 😂😌
The tile alarm sounds like Patrick and I'm here for it
No dungeon basement?
Just watched this video, and the underground house video back-to-back, and it's making me think that they exist in the same fantasy universe, and the girls who live in these houses know each other. And also they're dating
1:22 whaleber!
fun fact: the tallest tower in a castle was called the Don Jon, it was technically the most secure part of the castle and originally were prisoners were held. It's also were dungeon comes from. Could explain why in fairy tales princesses were always in the highest room in the highest tower.   So in this case having a dungeon on the second floor could make sense.  Other fun facts: a lot of castles were actually quite small. The battlements are call crenulation. Most castles were made of wood but then had a layer of Lyme or other fire resistant material over it, it's cheaper and easier to build in wood than stone. most castles wouldn't actually have moats, they had a ditch with sharp spikes that would often fill with water and mud and..."waste". Most castle walls were designed in a way to make scaling them difficult. Most windows would be just big enough to shoot arrows out of them. The area above the portcullis would be designed in a way to allow hot oil to be poured on the besiegers. A castle this small wouldn't have internal WC, but an out house, a bigger castle would have a wooden room the extended over the wall with a hole in the bottom to allow human waste to fall into the spike ditch.
IT WAS IN THE LIBRARY
I love how you both take care of each other in what you both want in each build. It heals my inner child to see
I beg you to do merch with the quote “my firstborn for the vibes” 😂 😂😂😂

this is a chandelier of a killer belluh </3
where do you find the mods you use?
The Urn is in the library!!!!
Lol... Study Urn. nice
I will say that the rain sounds really nice!
You should try building a cute cabin in Minecraft
15:57 "No one wants to hear a terrible twilight joke in 2024"  As someone who unironically still loves twilight, I beg to differ
that first really thin window was perfect noooooooooo
This is so random but you guys are soooo gorgeous!! I love your laughs and when you guys smile it really compliments your face shape, which is already so pretty🫶🫶🫶
Trying your code it didn't work
I wanna hear terrible Twilight jokes in 2024
You know what this build could use... Whalebert.
Connie: The Whimsy Caryn: The Vision
I FOUND THE URN IN THE LIBRARY NOOK LADDER ROOM ON A SHELF!
Charcutery boards were made in the 15th century while the medieval times were the 14th century
Caryn and Connie somehow make everything look amazing, even if at first it doesn't. In this video however, they make something already great look even greater by the end !
MAKE A DONUT BUILDING FOR YOUR NEWEST SERIES/NEWEST TOWN
we want all the twilight jokes in 2024 🐀
my costuming class calls the bunker under our school that we use for storage “the dungeon” but it’s not nearly as nice as your clothes dungeon
Can you make your videos shorter please?
living for the terrible twilight jokes, actually hahaha!
Challenge: create rooms in styles of random packs, but you can't actually use this pack to create the room
Challenge: create a House, but every room has a random amount of items (+floors and walls are included)

100 baby challenge for 1 million subs!!!
can you do a house in the sims but u can only use the first swatch 4 everything!!!!!!!!! also off topic but love ur vids =)
Woooooow....YouTube just censored w...itch. Are you kidding me? Oh my gosh. I am insulted, I shouldn't be this surprised at all, but oooook I guess? Whatever YouTube? Censor someone talking about their chosen faith why don't ya? Cus I know you're usually fine emojis so it DEFINITELY wasn't those. Tsk tsk tsk tsk.  Anyways.....as I initially stated before, wonderful job as always ladies. As a w....itch myself and someone with a username invoking the Fae I would love to live in your castle.  As always I will also leave a suggestion. Disney Princess Enchanted Journey is a PS2 game with a lovely castle I think you'd enjoy replicating if possible. Also it's a two player game perfect for sisters, my own lil sis and I played it all the time as kiddos. The castle also has a secret basement if that sweetens the deal for you. I know you like basements.  P.S. Let's hope the ... is a sufficient censoring for the bots. But yeah that is just ouch. I wonder how many of my comments even exist anymore on your channel now. Given I mention me being a w...itch constantly. My my.
Day 1 of asking for a apartment complex for the food court buildings last lot

Turn the werewolf and vampire town houses that you made a while ago into apartments so you can live in them like town houses!
Whalebur!! 😂❤
You guys should make a house using only the premade rooms! You’re allowed to change color swatches, and only remove 5 items, and add 5 items to each room.
I LOVED THIS 🥰 when I first saw the items included in the kit, I was a bit underwhelmed - but seeing what you’re actually able to do with it has got me so excited!
Bro if you could lift up both sides of your mouth when you talk that would be SICK.
Here before 1 mil 🫡
You guys HAVE to make a tiny house inside of a school bus!!!
Video idea: you should role a random color and make an entire house with that one color
WHY …   I check your channel every day and when I take a break from checking I see you posted 😭
This made me so happy 😊 thanks to both of you 💗 your personalities are beautiful and spunky and amazing 🎉 I feel like trying this challenge 😄
any packs you really recommend? i have just started playing the sims because of you guys and i love it!! i was just wondering if you or anyone has any pack suggestions.
You guys get this a lot but thank you for your uploads!! I love your chemistry and humour, you guys are always my comfort Youtubers ❤ I look forward to your uploads every week! You guys are incredibly talented and you’ve created a wonderful community 😊
I love castle builds so much <3
URN SPOTTED ON THE BOOKSHELF BY THE DESK
So cute!! I am so excited to use this kit!!
Do a build but every room is themed on a different animal/creature! Like one is themed on a fox, another is themed on a raven, another is themed on cats. Ect!  (Oh and you HAVE to make one room themed on Whalebert, Connie can’t disagree no matter what)
Challenge: Make a house and whale-Burt has to be in every room even outside😀

15:04 in one floor we have - a wizard/study room - the round table (nights of the round table) - the famous gaint spread - a dragon - treasure - and a fireplace  Great job, round of applause         👏    ↙️.   ↖️   👏.     👏    ↘️ .   ↗️         👏
I really enjoyed this video! Made my day ❤
Ooh maybe that could be another series! Mini golf course houses 😂 It reminds me of Gravity Falls and how the mini golf course had little creatures inside. There was a mini Eiffel Tower, a mini wind will, and a mini pirate ship for the course 😂
11:39 Oh hey now we can cosplay the knights of the round table
I love the twilight jokes 😭
I, for one, definitely want to hear all the terrible twilight jokes in 2024
If y'all were superheroes(villains) your names could be 'Whimsy' and 'The Vision'. 😂
I want you to go all out, making the most  grand castle you'd ever be able to imagine :D
My partner and I would love to see you guys do a palworld base build video. I’d love to see what you guys come up with
I disagree, everyone needs to hear shitty Twilight jokes all the time :D  🐀
I love how i bought werewolves for the garbage and the dirty old rug and not for the werewolves.
Back at it again with Caryn and Connie's favorite word count~ Here are your most used words:  Book(s): 2 Cute: 3 Columns: 4 Spandrels: 4 Whaleberg: (he was seen during the ad so I'm gonna count it) 1 Candles: 3 Rugs: 7 Windows: 5 Cozy: 1 Curtains: 2 Tiny: 10 Whimsical (whimsy): 5  and as a bonus, here are some common scenarios/events  Caryn complaining about wanting something done/not having something go her way in the Sims: 8 Debug Love: 1 Forgetting something is in the game/swatches they don't see: 4 Connie vs. Roofs: 0  Fun as always guys~
I will always appreciate a twilight joke ❤😂
I love them and can’t wait when they make new videos! ❤
Have you tried the game House Flipper? I think you would like it.
I really appreciated the terrible Twilight jokes tho lol

Please do a whale Bert house plssss I'm begging 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I wonder if there’s a way to make the most sims looking house ever, like everyone wants to make realistic or super cool houses, but what would the fakest or most sims looking house look like?
URN WAS IN THE LIBBARY! URN WAS IN THE LIBRARY!!
11:02
I FOUND THE URN
Fun fact, medieval France (15th Century) did in fact invent charcuterie :)
I just realised I'm addicted to kitchen cabinets to a point of being angry when a kitchen doesn't have cabinets. It's so empty without them 😭
Can you do a train please 🙏
Every time i watch your videos i get sad cuz I WANT TO LIVE THERE
All the castle builds ive seen are so small lol
Please please do something in snowy escape!
caryn is definitely my favorite since she reminds me of me always suggesting chaos and my sister being connie always bringing me back to reality 😭 i absolutely love their personalities and how they build (pun not intended) off each other and the energy they have hehehe. ive never even played the sims but theyre just so charismatic and fun to watch <3
honestly this just makes me want to have a castle gamepack with sword fighting and archery as a skill. or maybe even costume making/sewing/leatherwork for LARPing. could totally have new jobs included as well, historian for example. how cool would it be to include a medieval fair that allows axe throwing, fire spitting, juggling etc as event activities. it doesn't even need to have an actual gameplay thing to it (though having a form of royalty system with titles that get inherited or married into would be kind of cool), but it's a shame that they didn't expand on the possibilities of a medieval inspired gamepack that brings in some historic components. well, maybe in the future.
Now we need to do a home update for the disney princess villain houses 😊
My niece wants to see your animal crossing island
I have a Air up
I love how it turned out!
First, the build is gorgeous. But also, when I saw you put a trench for a moat in, I kept watching the whole time wondering when the water was gonna get added but it never did  DX
FOR ONE MILLION: YOU GUYS COULD GIVE US A HOUSE TOUR!  OR CHALLENGE ONLY BASE GAME SO PEOPLE CAN USE IT GIVEAWAY ASWELL!!!
MY FIRST BORN FOR THE VIBES absolutely sent me
Planned… Chance… ✨Destiny✨
An urn in the library has such witch vibes 😍
Urn! Urn! Urn!  never a compiled Carny and Connie build without a Urn
Your videos are perfect for me to relax
PLAY BLOXBURG ON ROBLOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!
make a build for wilber!
This entire video was gold. Cracked on “every room is a dungeon if you just *believe*!” And “this chandelier is a killer Bella!!!” 🤣🤣
I am trying to figure out what days you post so I can be prepared😂
Petition for Caryn and Connie to make a house in a roblox game (Rocitizens, Bloxburg etc.)  👇
Can you guys pleasee tell us some of the building mods you use <3
Hear me out… what if you have a stuffy nose and can’t smell…will they still work?
i’ve already watched all your videos so when I saw a short with new content I RAN to your page
I wish me and my twin got along this well😭 love your vids❤
Mistress c&c, quite contrary, how does your garden grow? With sims 4 build and sims 4 challenges, and sims 4 graves in a row!  (This is a very poorly done parody of “Mistress Mary” if anyone is wondering)
I would love you guys to build a hobbit hole! (Maybe a neighbourhood to rent out??) I know adding more work, but I would love to see your take on it💙💙💙. Thank you for your videos, I always love them.
Second time of me asking this: can you all please make a entire house that looks like a child's bedroom. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
where the carrier pigeons doth roost lmaoooo
it wASNT CENTERED 😭😭
I wanna live in it so bad omggggg, what a gorgeous build!!
I am sorry to say that ruins is already a novel. It’s the third book in a trilogy. Dystopian sci-if, worth the read if you’re interested.
Please make the mini golf course build!! Think of the whimsy! I'm already picturing giant whalebert
Was mentioning a parapet a hint that you have read fourth wing by rebecca yarros?? or have I made it my life and am going crazy lmaoo
Y'all should either make The Burrows from Harry Potter or your own version of The March House from Little Women!!! All your builds give the cozy and whimsy vibes that those two houses NEED <3
Urn in the liiiibrary! Also, now you have to to a bit castle WITH a dungeon. Or! A modern-ish castle WITH a dungeon.
I actually want more bad twilight jokes in 2024
Since you went small on this one, how about recreating the house from Saltburn for the next? That one's massive and GORGEOUS!
Now we need a grand princess castle with a ballroom! 🤩💕
my suggestions for future builds !! 1. build a house but every room is a reference to your older videos ( a wheel decides what video)  2. build a house but everything is opposte of how you usually do it ( your least favorite color, furniture, etc.) 3. building a house but every room is a reference to our favorite rooms in each video 4. build a house but only using stuff you rarely use 5. build a house but you have to use every pack in a room ( it can also be sorted via wheel, every expansion pack in a room, every game pack... etc) 6. build a house but for every room you have to use every time that starts alphabetically
came for the castle, stayed for the Twilight references :P
Sims 2 player here, are you using CC or is that stuff all from the expansions?
I really want to see you guys play among us soooo bad
is now a good time to mention outside bin?
Fun fact this type of castle structure is more like a "motte" a precursor to the castle. They where tall stone structures. Historicaly they where not that big and made from stone. They were popular in the 1700
Maybe I'm asking myself if they could do some Gothic Catedral with this pack? The roof kinda gonna work for this
you guys should do rapunzels castle with this pack
Twilight is one of my favorite things to ever exist so I definitely still want bad twilight jokes 🐀
Charcuterie boards actually do appear to have origins in the Medieval period! (I got this from Wikipedia and random food blogs, so take this with a grain of salt)
I noticed myself looking for/finding the urn immediately after the preview of the house started 😂
THE URNNNNN
When they were placing the tiny treasure chest i was going earn, EarN, EARN!!!🤣 (Not sure how to spell it) also we all know they had tilo include the whale somewhere in this video😂
This vid was so much more chaotic then usual. I loved it
“This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella” took me OUT.
Omg so glad you guys posted this! I've been missing your videos! I love your content so much!!!❤
This castle gives off Gale’s tower
That counts as a tiny house? That's, like, a studio apartment
Can you please make a large gothic castle for our frenemies-to-lovers Vampire and Werewolf who were past-neighbours? 😂
I love this cute lil castle, it's adorable! But what's the BIGGEST castle you guys could possibly make? 👀
The Urn is in the Library!!!
The urn was in the DIY bookshelf❤❤❤❤
Ngl you missed the chance to make a kids castle like in Barbie, Chelsea’s play house kinda thing
I’m love you guys so much (no offense this isn’t trying to be mean) but WHENEVER THEY LAUGH AT THE SAME TIME I’M SO SORRY BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE “HaHa again, haha AGAIN, HAHA AGAIN” IM SO SORRY BUT ITS SO FUNNY
🎉 it was in the library
Next time make a big castle
Missed you guys 🥰
You should build a house but every room is a different expansion pack
If Connie's nickname is whimsy, then  can Caryn's nickname be windows so then they could be Windows and Whimsy
You should have used the stained glass bed!!
Please make another castle with a GIANT library, observatory (what I though you were going to do with the moon rug) and a dungeon.
“WE’RE CONTRARY!” 0:12 I thought you were Caryn and Connie?? 😰
I FOUND THE URN!!!
i love how whenever they show them building in their sponsor clips, its always just like a house with whalebert on top
I love how one explains what they're doing in game, and the other is like ✨️oooooh pretty✨️   (I don't know which is which, yet, I'm still pretty new to the channel 🥺)
I was here before 1 million
*starts taking about air up* Me: to late, I already have one In the fridge 😂
I want to see them build a house in roblox bloxburg. I build in that game and it’s a lot of fun, but a bit different from the sims :)
Idea: size down Whalebert and use him as a bath toy you could put him on the rim of the tub or something. You said in a past video that you want to use every item at least once, this could be a good way to use Whalebert!
I have an idea. A Duel. Or in this case, Dueling against each other. Since we did a normal castle, how about a Gothic princess versus pretty pop princess castle? And the challenge is that you EACH build one half of the whole castle, one half in Gothic and the other is pretty in pink.
Yay a new vid, it's been so long, well now I need to find or make a spellcaster to live in here in my supernatural save, your builds always make me want to play in them lol! 😊🥰  You guys always crack me up too, always love your vids! 😊🥰 Wow that library bit! 😍 I will track down that urn and edit my comment once I find it lol! 😊
I AM HERE FOR THE TERRIBLE TWILIGHT JOKES!
🐀🐀🧐🧐🩵🩵
I need more castle content *-*  pretty pls
We do in fact want to hear terrible twilight jokes, 10/10✨
Looks simultaneously cute and majestic!
Finaly a new vid i LOVE your videos
The urn is with the books
Where was this kit a few months ago when I downloaded gigs of cc to turn an entire neighborhood into a medieval village 😭 Could’ve saved me sooo much headache trying to make clearly modern furniture work for the time period!  (Shoutout to modders tho, there’s some seriously amazing stuff out there if you want to turn the sims into a period piece!)
Apartments for fairies!
I didnt think it could be so tiny... It was smaller than I thought 😂😂😅
I found the urn lol
It's always so satisfying watching Caryn and Connie create such amazing and detailed builds. The level of creativity and attention to detail is truly admirable. Keep up the fantastic work!
It would be so cool if they added gameplay features in this where you can actually play like you’re a royal medieval family, such as having servants, having royal career paths, fighting between siblings for who will succeed the throne, and a lack of technology to get things done. Oh and hosting balls would be cool too. And new clothing would be awesome too.
get together has flags in roof details
I am having a ball watching all your videos. Thanks for making my day better ❤❤❤
now make a BIG castle
I could watch you build castles forever and have a ball doing it😅
I LOVE TWILIGHT CONTINUE WITH THE BAD JOKES
I have an idea that u girls should DEFINITELY do...later down the line grab one of ur original builds and update it with ur modern (future) build style and NEW tips 😊😊😊
Is it bad I used to think her name was Carrie?i also thought you were sisters…
so close to 1M! you guys are awesome AND PLEASE DO A FULL STEAMPUNK HOUSE IM BEGGING
my favorite creators caryn and contrary
This one looks so good, Ooooh what about a pastel fairy castle next!!?
give us a BIG castle to go with the mini
Make a house but every room is a different ✨ personally ✨
For 1mil you guys should combine some old videos like a wheel decides what era for this room and one room with one color and randomly generated room size. I think it would be a nice look back on everything you guys have done
I looked it up! Charcuterie boards were officially invented sometime during the Rennaissant period in France, though the basic practice has been traced back to ancient Rome.
She was a farie hah SHE WAS A WICH!!!!!?? HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHH😂😂😂 was so funny
SO CUTE!
Since you like fairytales you could do a cottage core fairy vibes 2 story house good idea right ?  👇
Well now I wish to see you both build a mages home
Pleasee do a wheel spin hotel!! New theme per floor 🔥💧🌳🌸💡🔮
Urn in the tiny library. Bottom right :)
"This is the chandelier of a killer bella". I LOVE that!
The earn being in almost every build is iconic
it’s the way i have refreshed y’all’s page for a MONTH and now that you’ve posted i can finally take a deep breath 😩
Urn at 18:47 on bottom shelf of library, right next to the window
I found myself genuinely grinning throughout the entire video. You guys are truly a joy to watch.
What is this? A castle for ANTS?!
the urn is in the library! the urn is in the library!
This is my favorite build you’ve ever done!!! 😍
I think the ern was in the library on the bottom self right next to the desk
I think this could turn into a really cool challenge where every generation you make a bigger version of the castle or you like add another room to it
18:45 URN URN URN URN URN-
Hear me out: for 1m subs, each room is a different challenge. So basically you would spin a wheel to determine the challenge (ex: budget, colour, time limit, etc) then you would spin another wheel for that specific challenge (ex: 10k, only red, 5:00m, etc)
You guys should make a school. Like a college. That would be sick
The urn in the book nook is SO Caryn and Connie 😂😂😂😂❤
Those twilight jokes absolutely ended me😂😂😂 and I spotted the urn before yall even mentioned it (I was starting to worry when caryn hadn't pointed it out right away lmao)
You would be incorrect. There is nothing we want to hear more than terrible twilight jokes in 2024.
Its been a while since I uninstalled sims 4, maybe its time to download it back?
You guys should make your own dream houses! Making a way so that you would still be close and making videos but had your own sides you know! Or you could make 3 different houses based off how you would’ve liked them from when you were young, now, and when your old! I think this would be such s cute but funny video! Omg! You should design each other’s houses! That would be so cool!
I just had an idea for what to do for the last lot in the food buildings area! Imagine a milkshake and malt-themed diner but their whole thing is that they're 2nd place to the pancake diner and are extremely bitter about it. Like they went to cooking contests and got 2nd place to the pancakers every single time.
I was just thinking of you guys the other day. Yay for a new video! Love the teeny castle =D
oh my god i have been checking their channel every day for an upload ever since their previous one and it's SO GOOD!!! i never thought about  tiny castles before but now i will never stop thinking about them because this is so cute omg 🥹🫶🫶🫶
the IVY was getting on my perfectionism. so glad you covered it.
Charcuterie boards DO originate from medieval times.
“This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella”
You reminded me to drink water😅 I have a problem of forgetting my basic needs…..
Now that you've done a castle, here's a challenge. Pirate ship house.
THE QUEENS ARE BACK!
Omg you guys are almost at 1 mil already! You guys tottaly deserve it, you two are hilarious❤🥳
That's the first and one of the prettiest tiny castles I seen 😂
I died at “SHE WAS A WICH!”😂😂😂
Subscribing is cool!
15:19 not even kidding I'm making that line into a custom poster for my room right now
been eagerly awaiting a new upload thanks guys :)
Found the Urn in the library
I know a lot of people ask for alot but I don’t have a lot of those packs and I really want a beautiful horse ranch  for at least 3 horses and essential stuff of course like laundry stuff and vacuums and seasons stuff and some of the rent stuff
The whale in on Caryn’s screen during the sponsor… AMAZING
Petition for them to build a dungeon now
YOU COULD MAKE AN CASTLE MUSEUMMMM
make a whalebert aquarium also finish the magnolia promenade food court
You guys are always funny but this one had me howling with laughter ❤
Addendum to the medium/tall height doors: Build a tall wall on the first basement level and you'll always have access to all the options!
“ThIs iS thE chAnDElieR of A kiLLer bEllA”
The urns in the library
How about making a house that’s inspired by a dollhouse? Like all pink and girly
Church/castle wedding venue???
Love y’all’s content just need way more of it!
I SAW WHALEBERT IN THE AIR UP AD!!
yall made it to the trending page☺️
I think this will be perfect for a kidnapped princess storyline. What if the princess is the dragon and is just a massive introvert? Fill in the castle with heaps of golds and jewels in corners hehe
For the sofa, I’m imagining partially reading, and partially fainting Victorian lady disease, otherwise known as syphilis.
“ how would that even work?” Three words, Tower of London. You don’t even have the excuse of being Americans, I myself am from the United States.
Lots of old country homes in England and Europe would build small castles in the ground to be used for fun/amusements or guest accomodation. In the uk they’re called follies and many have been renovated into modern homes if that their old aristocratic estates have been broken down.
the way the second floor looks like a crab made me laugh way too hard
ea needs to stop giving us packs that desperately need spiral stairs and then NOT them to us 😭😭
When they said it started raining, it also started raining for me😭😭 yall r so powerful lmaoo
Oo the round table!!
I love writing my scriptures next to grandma, it’s like she’s still here 🤗
"this is the chandelier of a killer, bella" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is that an urn I see in the library 👀
No whalebert in the moat???
I could watch your channel forever
“nobody wants to hear a terrible twilight joke in 2024” I DO I WANT TO HEAR THEM
I've been playing this game for YEARS and this is the first time I hear about using shift+c to alter the rooftops more!? WHAAAAAAAT?
GUYS WAKE UP CARYN AND CONNIE POSTED
urn it the library, soaking up the knowlage
Actually in Debugg, there are some beautiful weeping willows, i think they are in cottage living, base game and another one. They are so pretty and i love using them!
your videos never fail to deliver!
I loved this tiny cozy castle!!  And I FOUND THE URN!!!😂
How funny it would be if you guys tested if sims can walk there after builds?
I might actually have to buy the vampire pack just to have better furnishings for my castles! Great vid!
I FOUND THE URN
I would do anything for a room by room remake of Bella swans house from y’all omg Twilight was like my whole childhood lol
don't think you can hide that urn from me :) (was it in the library?)
What if u built a castle BUT every room is a different booktok book? (Cuz ✨books n castle✨)
The twilight joke 😂
the urn becoming an every-build thing while whalebert CONTINUES to be snubbed is hilarious
I can't be the only one who went URN after memory box
Team Jacob Or Edward?
Thank you for the twilight quotes 😭🤣 ✨🐀✨ (also make another one. BUT BIGGER! DUNGEON AND ALL.)
Pls make more sims build I really REALLY love watching them!!! I learn new thing and watching you build!!!
The urn is In the library❤❤
Yay!!! New vídeo ❤
um EXCUSE ME I always need bad twilight jokes regardless of the year
Now you just need to make an old Gothic castle that's been renovated slightly and turned into an apartment building!
Really glad you edited that part! Love the Knight manager!!!
Video idea. You spin the wheel to pick a random item to hide in a room. But one room for every swatch and you can only use base game and the pack the items from for the whole build
The chaotic energy in this one was 😙👌
Yall and Lilsimsie are my favorites💕
This is such a great build
love this.  now make a stunning whimsical fairytale cottage living castle covered in ivy with foxes and critters and tapestries and balconies and and towers and string lights. please dewit it would be so cute😭🫶
You didn't have to "settle" for a circle table in the dining room. A circle table is perfect for the "knights of the round table" vibe ;)  Also, CASTLES. WHOOOOOOO. I love castles. I would love to see more castles <3
My first born for the vibes!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
BIG CASTLE
7:16 Im pretty sure this only works when u have the bb.moveobjects cheat on
OMGGGGG HOW ABOUT MAKING GOTHIC HIGH-SCHOOL CASTLE???? I think it’s gonna fit so much with cake-cafe and pizza restaurant❤️
18:45 the urn is on the bottom shelf on the right
You guys are freakin geniuses!!!
You need to write that book quickly, it would fit the "a verb of noun and plural noun" format perfectly!  SJM 👀
PLEASE BUILD US A TAVERN PLEASE PLEASE 😭😭😭
Its like a mini castle a king would hide is daughter
I love this urn game. Haha.
Library URN
Oooo cool! Now..HAUNTED CASTLE! Imagine how  cool tgat be? :D
I always look forward to your uploads 😭
I SAW THE URN!!
Build a popcorn movie theater to complete the food court series please!
OH MY GOD A NEW VIDEO
Just wanted to let you know that there's a problem with this build....it's too perfect and it's not real so I can't live in it!!
Beauty and the beast castle next?!?!?!?!
i am completely obsessed with your videos !!
I love that people are making tiny castle builds because early castles were quite small! Many were only 2-3 rooms
loved the video
764th comment here! also btw did anyone else find the bc i did
800th comment
I saw an ad with a car on it and now I wanna see a car house 🚗
i can't believe you made this beautiful build with this awful pack lol
not being able to watch this video immediately when it came out was the worst 20 hours of my life
Great video, love it.❤ Btw you know how you always have problems with the candles not resizing with the flame, you can get rid of the flame by completely dimming the light with the TOOL mod. It ends up being just an unlit candle. Should also work with chandeliers. ❤
“Anywhere can be a dungeon if you just believe!” Sounds like a bad Disney quote 😂😂
'This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella' - This cracked me up so good, love a good twilight reference in 2024. Happy to see you guys again <3 Also, the urn is in the library
URN! Nothing better than to read spooky story from your "library" while being watched by your ancestors xd
Porcupine is now an inside joke 😭😭😭
Found the urn! 18:45 bottom shelf, it's like a golden trophy but lo and behold it's an urn!  Also RANDOM idea BUT you guy could do like "renovating" an old prison/jail into a cute house, since Caryn kinda wanted to build a dungeon. Idk, just an idea! Great video as always!
WHALEBERT CAMEO!!
I have an idea for you guys, both of you agree on some rules ( how many rooms, the theme, floors number...ect) and then each one of you build her own house ( of course you can add any other ideas to main).  I think it will be soo fun to see both of your houses and what will be different and similar
I have missed you both so much, at last you return to me <3
I’ve been WAITING for you to upload. I don’t even know how to explain it, but your videos are my mental-health-happy-place.  I haven’t even watched the video yet, because I’m saving it for when I need a comfy brain moment. Love your content & thanks for what you do! ❤️❤️
I Wouk’s love to see a rap Uzbek tower but if it was run down and old WITH IVY 😏 I think it could even have a cool backstory to it
Another really great build. The tiny castle looks amazing. Also I vote in favour of a mini golf course build .
Urn urn urn urn
Ok but like, no door to the front balcony seems like a missed opportunity.
I was really hoping you were using that castle sized up 😂😂😂
Ok here me out, Disney apartments. So your could have like one apartment for belle and you could have rapunzel on the top floor. ❤
This makes me so happy! I would love to see y'all do another million simolian build, but building an ultimate whimsical fantasy castle
honeymoon hotel for valentines day?
"my firstborn for the vibes!!"  i also wholeheartedly enjoyed the knight manager joke 😌
7:58  I would kill to see you guys make a golfcourse in the sims xd
15:55 THATS WHERE YOURE WRONG 😤 I have rewatched twilight twice now in 2024
What if… hear me out, make a really tall house like a lighthouse or tower and have a really big family inside and half of the family has a cute, pink, soft vibe and the other half have a gothic, dark, black vibe, but you have to include a family room where both the aesthetics mix, it can be a good mix or a really chaotic mix with spots of black and pink everywhere
What kind of kooky Castle builder decided to put the dungeon right next to the master bedroom?
How about you build the toy castle, it would also be interesting to look at
Not porcupine ashdashdbasfas  😭😭😭😭
I keep rewatching every single one of your videos and when the new one came out I was so happy!!! New thing to rewatch it until I remember every line from it
🤫 you can use the scentpods more than once 🤫
I don’t even have the sims & I now watch this channel religiously.
Found the urn! I also saw that whalebert cameo 😉
Caryn and connie im waiting forr your video omggg
I was so happy when I woke up to a notification saying u guys uploaded ❤❤
It’s only been 500,000 years lol but i truely hope you all had an awesome holiday and break!
I love the twilight room 😂❤
standing by, frothing at the mout)h, wautung for a c&c video, if drops and i learn so much and their ads r awesime and i love their grind 💜💜💜🫶u go girls
Wake up, A new Caryn and Connie video dropped 💕
I loved the terrible Twilight jokes! 😂
U guys should make a woohoo hotel or toddler house it's like a house but just for toddler
Hey! Could you build a whaleburt themed waterpark? It seems really fun! 💧🏖
Hi
still rlly disappointed the doors, pillars, and windows dont have swatches to match the mossy flowers :/
I thought you guys might wanna try out building in this game called pony town. It might be a challenge but hey, that's what you guys are about.
i know u guys like whimsy…. so i’m requesting a whimsical fairy build!!! maybe u could idk make like a fairy camper or something to spice things up! love ur vids 💕
I have a question, how do they do the showing thing at the end? Is there a setting for that or do they do it manually?
Y'all should make a Vampire Castle and a Haunted Castle!!
16:18 - 16:19 my favorite part of the video 😂😂😂
Technically torches wasn’t very used as permanent lighting. You needed a really big one just to make it last 30 minutes. Instead they had candles everywhere. Shadiversity if ya wanna know more
I absolutely want to hear a terrible twilight reference in 2024
a rapunzel tower sounds good after this video!
now refrence back to the the vampire and werewolf neighbours video what if the next castle build is the vampires house before he moved to the house cause his ded wife now haunts the castle-
The portrait on the bedroom wall just makes me think of how weird it would be to have pics of your mom and dad up while you're bringing home a partner and trying to woohoo XD
The urn lives on⚱️😂
The ern was in the turret library!
Your right the french made charcuterie in the late 1500s
16:06 I feel like this castle would fit Morgana from Merlin 😸🫶🫶 (princess whose also a witch)
The urn is in the library close to desk by the bottom
I was so upset at the lack of an urn…. Just to be blessed at the end with SURPRISE URN 😂
I just woke up abd saw you guys made a new videoo and my heart went to the moon!!!!! Im so happy a new video came outtt!!!and the castle looks so coollllll!!
WOOOOOOOO I LOVE YOU GUYS
New SIMS build challenge: every room is a different planet
My friend had an air up bottle but she lost it and wasn’t allowed to get another one so she was very upset about it and was talking about it all the time
i already knew they were getting sponsored by air-up when they told that they drink a lot of water 😭
Can’t wait for the “anything can be a dungeon” merch!
I'd also love to see a medieval d&d style tavern!
Yayyyyy they’re back!!!!
um, excuse me, I ALWAYS want to hear a terrible twilight joke 🐀 ✨
I ALWAYS WANT TO HEAR A TERRIBLE TWILIGHT JOKE IN 2024!!!!!!!!
You should make Hogwarts!!
Technically the “did medieval people invent charcuterie” is correct as charcuterie boards were actually invented in 15th century France
OMG FINALLY!!! I've watched all of you guys video while waiting for your upload, i even rewatched some of them!
hot dog shaped hot dog stand? or….and hear me out here, a lasagna shaped italian restaurant?!?!
NEW C&C POST YAY
you are both delightful and endearing, thanks for sharing your sim content <3
You could have said, simsical instead of whimsical
Look not only am I here for twilight jokes in 2024 I am begging you to do a twilight BUILD in 2024
Million dollar castle!
Personally I feel like whalebert could have been a fun addition to the moat… 🐳
urn in mini library?
Why not shelves to make a bench seat in the dining nook?
I'd love to see you guys do a live challenge in one of your builds! Or really just play in general, I'd love to see what you get up to. For added chaos maybe multiplayer mod?
You guys are so unhinged in this and I LOVE IT!
"No one wants to hear a terrible Twilight joke in 2024!" ... I want to hear a terrible Twilight joke in 2024 🥺
I need a small castle or tower build for an eclectic wizard
OH THE FLAGS FROM GET TOGETHER WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT FOR THE TOP OF THE SPIRES
What if y’all do a ruined castle or a castle with ancient ruins in the woods?
You guys should make an astronomy tower! 🌌🪐⭐
Not exactly what you said but Rooks and Ruin is a really good book series!
I love the builds so much always, but its always the problem that wanna live here so baddddd!!
The Urn has returned 🎉   I found the URN
missed the uploads so much & so excited to watch this one!! i’ve been rewatching the videos i’ve semi forgotten just so it can act as new content 😭🫶
I think the urn is in the library area
charcuterie boards were invented in 15th century france - so yes medieval people DID invent them!
That added comment at the end about the Urn?? I spent the entire time y'all were making the built-in bookcases thinking, "This would be a great spot for The Urn."
Did y’all see Caryn putting Whale Bert in a roof during the air up sponsor😂😂😂😂😂
Got terrible news today and this honestly made me feel a bit better, thanks you for being such positive and fun people.
i’ve been watching since the first color challenge I love your vids you two are SO underrated ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just realized this is your first 2024 video!!🎉
the urn was  in the library
Loved this
Literally the first thing I did with the new pack was a tiny build 😂 I literally haven't built one castle with it yet
Up next: Renovated Castle apartments
HERE BEFORE 1M GANG START FORMING
It's a starter castle
I’m so curious if they’ve ever started a video and actually gotten to a point where they don’t think they can make what they want and have to give up haha
MOTHERS!!!!!!!
pls do giant castle or i will wither away to nothing from the pain
Smell dosen't affect me for some reason taste wise, but how it looks on the otherhand. Also i hope we get a old decrepit, abandoned castle out inn the Woods.
Can confirm on the AirUp water bottle, I got one after seeing MatPat with his and honestly it works so good 😂
More Castles Please❤❤
ive been here for agessss and im always happy when you get sponsored 😭😭❤️❤️ get your bag girls!!!
Okay, this is the best castle estate kit build I've seen so far. You guys really bring it.
"Rocks and Ruins" When Gemma, a Geology student runs into Archeology student, Archie, the two butt heads over a dig site. As punishment for their constant disagreements, their professors send them to ruins on a secluded island. Will the two over come their differences or will they destroy one another (but like it has to be sexually because booktok)   Your welcome, I wrote your book
CARRY AND CONNIE. LISTEN. UPLOAD MORE. WE LOVE YOU!!!  (no but seriously I will find you guys if you don’t upload more.)
guys caryn and connie uploaded
Thank you now I can eat my chicken and rice in peace so beautiful when life aligns
LIBRARY URN 🗣️🗣️
“She was a fairyyy she was A WItCh”
FOUND THE URN! won’t say where for those that arnt sure but                  Library book book area lol
Is it even a Caryn and Connie build if there isn't an urn? Ps that one matched the vibes with all the books and magic elements. 10/10 urn placement
For 1 million subscribers, you should do a Rejected House! All of the Ideas you usually reject (like the creepy mannequin, polkadot wallpaper, and most importantly WHALEBERT) and put them into one house!!!
Ok but the fact that I was bored and I didn’t know what to watch and I saw that you girls posted a video made me so happy !!
i am here for the twilight references. please dont stop.
The hilarious thing is that this is more true to life than giant castle estates. If you have to build the castle by hand out of stone you cut, most wealthy families are going to make them small. Theres way more tiny castles than big famous ones (and movie castles are way out of proportion)
Y'all's videos are always so joyous. I always look forward to them!
I live for the Twilight jokes 🤌🏽
Soooo happy y’all posted omg. My jaw literally dropped when I saw the video lol
Had to go back and find the urn once it was mentioned, lol
URN! URN! URN! IS THE URN ON THE BOOKSHELVES? URN!
The French created charcuterie in the 15th century according to Google! So yes!! charcuterie was invented by medieval people since the Middle Ages/Medieval Times lasted from the 5th to the 15th century 😊
I googled it. The charcuterie was invented in 15th Century France so, yes. They are medieval
How do you get infinite money in Sims?
Petition for them to do a harry potter inspired build!!!!!
12:16 internally dying when I saw that the curtains didn’t match the rug I screamed on the inside
Where was the urn?
THE EARN IS IN THE LIBRARY I AM WAS VERY INVESTED IN THAT
1:26 when i first started watching y’all i really thought it was some joke that it was two people and it was really only one of y’all also how come y’all only use one monitor
YAY NEW UPLOAD 😀😀
i've been rewatching your videos today, disappeared to do mom stuff for a while, just refreshed your page and there's a new video! you two are FOREVER my favorites <3
*me when i see the millionth  air up sponser* "ok, ok, jeeze i'll get it!, chill!"
Fun fact: medieval peasants would use dry bread as plates and eat with their hands, while the dukes and kings would use gold plates and utensils.
This build remind me of the beasts castle from Beauty and the Beast! ❤
i did try to build a repica of the castle dollhouse i think it came out well but its not fuctional.
Oh yk its a good day when Caryn and Connie post
I want more Twilight jokes in my sim 4 builds please! Always great jokes 10/10!!!!
EVERYONE wants a terrible Twilight joke in 2024.
We need a fairytale house with every room is a different story
THIS IS THE CHANDELIER OF A KILLER   god I love you hahahahahhaha
urn is in the study/library
Library Urn!!!!!
I’n probably the only dude here, but i’m glad you’re back❤
I get so happy when I see you guys have posted your videos are always so fun to watch idk why lol
18:44 URN
TIME 18:44 URN HAS BEEN FOUND!!! >:)
Big castle with a WIZARD TOWER "Wizards need enrichment in their enclosures," King Arthur says to Guinevere as he's helping Merlin decorate his tower.
Library
I LOVE THE TWILIGHT JOKES.. everyone needs to make them
NOT THE TWILIGHT JOKES--
Now I’m curious to see them tackle decorating in The Sims Medieval!
omg i love the building!!! i thinnk you shoul build more castles, like, bigger!!
Think I found the urn ⚱️ 🎉
I heard you guys say the word “Water” and I knew an air up commercial was coming 😂
Bingo.
Now do a medium sized castle with at least 2 rooms and 2 baths and a large castle with at least 4 to 5 beds and baths 😂❤❤
15:57 WE ALL WANT TO HEAR BAD TWILIGHT JOKES IN 2024
The next million dollar build should be a castle  (With a complete dungeon of course)
spoiler alert!!!!      Urn on the bookshelf lolll
Have they ever done a challenge where they build a house while only using the default splotches? 👀
as a twilight fanatic the references gave me LIFE
Just yesterday i was missing a video from you guys!!
Now I could make a proper cathedral to wed sims and throw royal weddings
I was waiting for this ❤
I love every time when Caryn and Connie take turns being the Responsible Twin™ and the Chaos Twin™ true sibling energy
Fun fact! Charcuterie was indeed invented during medieval times--15th century France! This was near the tail end of the era! 😃🇫🇷
THEYRE BACK
ripp, the second ya'll mentioned the pack in the video I paused to go buy it, long before the code was brought up. Great video tho! If you ever do a charity event or otherwise I'll be sure to pay it forward
"this is the chandelier of a killer, bella" sent me
Does your sponsor's water work on people who can't smell things?
9:53 I literally said the same thing they should have added torch lighting! It would have been so nice.
Yes we have been fed again
We need a goth dream house queens. Pls pls pls
You can tell you love a YouTuber when you don't skip their sponsors
Of course whale Burt has to be in the video 😂🐳
I NEED ANOTHER MILLION SIMOLEONS HOUSE BUT A CASTLE NOW
im so sad, i made a castle for caryn and connie with my limited packs and now it doesn't matter because of this dang castle pack...
URN IN THE TURRET LIBRARY NOOK urns arent meant to be this cute
Thank you so much for posting a new video! I binge watch you guys so much and I love new videos.
knowing that i am able to downlode your builds and really few things will be deleted is what tells me i own too many sims packs
my inner 8 year, old who's hyperfixation was castles, is screeching with joy
You make any pack, (even notoriously bad ones) look great!
omg I have been waiting for a new video and it’s finally here!❤
Open shelves, always the perfect spot for an urn 😂
Love yall! Also, URN IN THE LIBRARY <3
now u guys have to make a MASSSIVE castle that rivals all of your previous builds >:)
I WANT to hear terrible Twilight jokes in 2024, thank you very much
great video, ridculous sponsor
I would love to see you guys play the game unpacking since you are so good at decorating. It would turn out so good! Love your videos 🩷
Cqn you make a base game mansion 🤩🤩🤩
🐀?
Bulbasaur succulent! Bulbasaur succulent!
we love a library urn
don't you mean Contrary and CARYN-trary
I see the urn, amongst the bookshelf clutter as usual
If you click the cog button on the dream home decorator couch you’ll find different sections for the couch and one looks like a circle booth (make sure Auto sofas is on and the earn was in the bookshelf downstairs)
SIMMERS HELP!!! Shift commands haven’t worked for me :( I can’t even do half tiles. Everything I’ve tried hasn’t worked. Any advice??
i saw the urn in the bookcase but i will admit i only saw it bcs i was screaming at my phone to add the urn
How do y’all do the tour tho
I have been waiting for a new video!! I love your videos. They calm my adhd brain
oh great, now i have to write a high fantasy novel called Rocks and Ruins 😡 😡  also i checked and yeah charcuterie was made in the medieval times so i guess this build is historically accurate or something
Brittany Broskis castle fr, it’s tiny so she can afford it bc no one pays their taxes 💀💀
Are you sure we can't take the Rocks and Ruins? What if we show you the book and you love it!
My friends in the group chat:  GUYS, GUYS THEY POSTED!!! GUYS GUYS TINY CASTLE GUYSSSSSS
there is a couch in the first pet pack that fit in octagonal rooms
DUNGEON NEXT TIME
New Year, same me (obsessed w Caryn and Connie)
Omg a fantasy castle would be amazing, super whimsical, and fairy tale. But, make it Druid themed. So all natural and a lot of plants
Omg I love you soo much  but…. Can you post more pls!
0:43 Lol so true one time I was eating a chocolate chip muffin and my friend who was eating a chocolate cupcake was eating and smelled my muffin and they tasted it 😂 Also I love how this build turned out, so cool ❤
We still need a build with a little nook in every room!!🥺
cottage living has a great debug willow tree
! did you play test the bedroom?
Wait now I have to rewatch it to find the urn 😂
18:45 URNNN
15:56 I absolutely want to hear a Twilight joke in 2024!! I'm already re-reading it!!
Random, but I think I own that same green sweater
I haven’t even watched the video yet but IM SO HAPPY
YOURE BACK! 😄😄😄
Shrek shaped castle and no princess fiona???? 😂❤
I saw the urn as you all were changing the swatches in the room and was like “there is the urn!”
I would kill to live in a house like this
why did you change the thumbnail ?
I know you’re not starting a Q&A but I still have a question. Do you ever download custom content or build CC?
Living room urn!
Are y’all sisters or dating??
I have found the urn😂!!!! It was in the book selves in the turret 🎖️
Scream-laughed at Whale-bert getting his spotlight in the sponsor section of the video 😂😂
Dear Caryn and Connie,  I humbly ask if I can use rocks and ruins as a chapter title.  (Im serious about the idea but this is a joke lmaooo)
THE QUEENS POSTED EVERYBODY GET HYPED :DDD
i've had my airup since christmas and thanks to you just found out how to use it properly 🤣😂
I had the same idea last week and built a tiny home castle with 73 tiles! Mainly did it because everyone online was saying that the little is very niche and not versatile enough, so I tried to do something different than a classic giant castle. I had so much fun, I also added a moat around it and turned it into a whimsical little castle in the woods in henford on bagley
The urn was exactly where I expected it to be 😂
I FOUND THE URN IN THE LIBARY
Can we get a "old money" / "new money home
I FOUND THE URN!!!! For some reason when you said urn i rewatched the whole video to find it. I wont spoil where tho, just that its there:)
I audibly choked from laughing so hard at "this is the chandelier of a killer, bella"
13:30 Yes actually, It dates back to ancient times when Greeks and Romans would preserve meat for long journeys by salt-curing the meat, then smoking or drying it to further extend its shelf life, however, the Art of Charcuterie traditionally came from 15th century France where it spread across Europe and became more refined in the Middle Ages. 😁
the lack of dungeon is kilinggg me 😔
Love the book nook!
Au contraire, I DO want to hear terrible Twilight jokes in 2024
I love how you girls’ content makes me feel that I’m right there with you! Loved this build!
You two have officially been dubbed Whimsy & The Vision, henceforth
library is where the urn is
HIIIIIUI
The urn was in the library
Omg are you guys 🐀?????🥺
You should do a challenge where you cannot change swatches or one when you can't resize. You could also the wheel and for each room is a different challenge like the one i named! Love your vids so much!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Was that a Bulbasaur plant pot I saw below your guys' moniter??? It's so cute!!! 😄 Edit: Yes, charcuterie boards were made in the medieval era, they were made by the French in the 15th century
I want to hear the Twilight joke in 2024
I found the urn!
1 mill grand castle next?😂 /hj
“Nobody wants to hear a terrible Twilight joke in 2024” — respectfully, incorrect
"Starter castle vibes." 😂 cracked me up.
Y’all should make a build inspired by the Madrigal’s casita from Encanto!
U can make that steampunk castle now.
You should do a flower neighborhood! Each tiny home is a different flower. It could be like a little mini series or something 🤷🏼‍♀️🌹🌸🌺🌷🌻🥀
I was doing victorian house builds when this pack came out and it literally read my mind. Also, how about doing a victorian house build, but with a twist? Do a victorian house build but you can add another aesthetic of your choice, such as coastal or eclectic?
When will Wilbur make his debut on a build ???
Love the gorls especially when I’m ill🤧
THE QUEENS HAVE POSTED YESSS!!!  Y'ALL SO SLAY I LOVE UR VIDS😍🐹🐹   also this castle kit kinda gives The Tale of Despreaux
You should make a build only using high walls.
I saw plumbella do a build where she was only allowed to use items from the catalogue that began with the letter A, it would be so cute if you guys did the same thing but with the letter C (for clear reasons)
I saw that urn in the library!
I love this build!
If you two actually end up making a mini golf course, I think Whalebert would be a perfect addition! Edit: I found the urn! It’s on one of the bookshelves!
FINALLY YOU POSTED YOU ARE MY FAVOURITE TWINSSSSS 💖💖👯‍♀️👯‍♀️
The plant in the bathroom is touching fire.😅
443 comment!
0:11 CarynandCONNTRARYgaming
Ya'll go in! So fun to watch thank you!
It won't exactly be a functional activity, but I'd actually really like to see a golf course series! Like if they started a new game and made the different empty lots in Newcrest into different holes/courses, that would be so fun! And we'd get to see some really inventive terrain work, which would be entertaining.
"This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella" I'm on the FLOOR, stop!!
Not me just skipping back into the video searching for THE urn 😂
The Sims 4 first came out on my 10th birthday. I sat here thinking, "I'm only 15, it hasn't been out for 10 years." Then I remembered I'm an adult.
Not me rewinding to find the urn
Why is there a mirror in the vampire pack?🧛‍♂️
YAY NEW VIDEO
Why is there a mirror in the vampire pack?🧛‍♂️
“Say it.. out loud” *I* wanted to hear a twilight joke in 2024
Why is there a mirror in the vampire pack?🧛‍♂️
you could "urn" your keep in the library....
You should make a wheel full of different house aesthetics and spin it three times, when you have the two themes you can make both of them neighbors or roommates like the vampire and werewolf homes
Caryn and Connie: No one wants to hear a lame twilight joke in 2024 Me and my twin: WE DO!!!!😂❤
let’s honor the time that this takes because I could never
big fan of the urn hide and seek- petition to add it at the end of every video
You should build a wizard tower!!!
You guys make my day!!! I missed see your videos!!
I'll be honest. I'm living for the 2024 Twilight references. "This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella" TOOK ME OUT.
"She was a WITCH! 👹" Hahahaha!
The Twilight jokes got me good 🤣
THE URN IS IN THE LIBRARY
Desperately want you gals to do a huge castle now!!
URN SPOTTED! Absolutely adorable castle! Love this build so much!
Honestly, this whole build commentary has me cracking up. 😆😆 So good.
This is the best birthday gift. ❤. ✨ I love your guys videos!✨
"Say it. Out loud." "Vampire bed" is one of the best moments in this video. Convince me otherwise 😂
I saw that Whalebert during the sponsorship. WHEN WILL WE FINALLY GET OUR BOI.    also I saw the Urn in our turret library (aka my childhood dream, castle library like the beauty and the beast loving child I kinda still am)
The swords make total sense, there's a coat...of arms!
I need a witch castle!!!
OMG CAN YOU BUILD RUPENZELS TOWER
More castle builds pleeeeeease!
Not to enable (I'm enabling) but "chandelier of a killer" genuinely made me cackle
0:12 Caryn Connie and Contrary the secret triplet 😂😂😂
Yay! I couldn’t wait for the new video!
I can’t believe you guys are almost at 1M subscribers! You create such beautiful, entertaining, and inspiring content and truly deserve all of the love!! 💕🫶🫶
DUNGEONS DUNGEON DUNGEON!
but can you do a 1 mill castle?👀
Best Birthday gift! Having you guys post on my birthday! Love your videos!
You forgot the urn, it could have gone on the coffee table xx
yayyyyy i’ve been waiting for y’all to post 💗💗💗
Have you ever tried playing a game OTHER than sims????????????? :) like spiritfarer???????????? :)))))))))))
I wonder if you would like to try Tiny Glade when it'll be available for testing or playing. It's small viby castle/cottage builder with all the cute tiny details to make me think you two would definitely like it
This is the summer home castle that Anna would take if she had fire powers and went rogue instead of Elsa.
Been waiting for the castle vid from you guys 🫶  also I noticed the urn immediately and was very distraught that yall wouldn’t mention it but you came through just in time lol
😍🤩🥰
I saw it straight away😭 i love reading a book nice in a cosy library next to grandmothers urn😍🥰
Is the urn in the library?
You should do a series where you make the family in CAS that lives in your builds! You give the houses so much character let’s let these families come to life!!!!
Twilight jokes never get old
YAY NEW VIDEO🎉🎉🎉
I saw the urn!!!!!!!!!!!
Ooh, a telescope would have been great for the little balcony upstairs
Okay this might seem random but for the food court p, you could do a cozy library cafe.
Please make a beach themed sand castle!
You guys are BACKKKKK!!! I missed your videos!!
URN ALERT URN ALERT, I SAW IT IN THE TOUR!!!!!!!
You know it's a good day when Caryn and Connie post
I loved the furniture twilight reimagining 😂 Maybe the witch princess has a vampire date lol
3:09 head seizure glitch??
y’all are so chaotic in the best way😭❤️definitely my favorite sims gaming channel by far!!!
I love the use of whaleburt in the promo
Great build will def be getting it  P.S road to 1mil!!!
Eine Ranch in schloss 🏰 style wäre cool 😎
The game boy became the game boy advance  The Nintendo entertainment system became the Super Nintendo entertainment system  The Ds became the 3Ds  The Wii became the Wii U So it really feels like the switch is going to become the switch 2 (Put your cool switch 2 names in the comments)
I appreciate the new, slower tour!
I WANT TO HEAR THE HORRIBLE TWILIGHT JOKES IN 2024! I DO!
I HAVE THE SAME SWEATER
I've been waiting for another video from you guys! This makes me so happy. I have been rewatching all your other sims building videos in the meantime :). Absolutely love watching your videos!!
You guys should build a castle for whaleburt
So, you're big fans of plants, string lights, and books, and I know you had fun doing that steam punk kitchen. So I'm wondering.....  Have either of you heard of the style called solarpunk?   I think it's super up your alley and I'd love to see you do that style sometime.
Now it's time for the $1 million castle
I was so sad and down today then I saw the new video, I'm legit feeling better. Caryn and Connie my comfort YouTube ❤❤
“My firstborn for the vibes!” engrave this on my tombstone please and thank you
I feel like i'm early
FINALLY THEYRE BACK😻
Not Caryn putting Whalebert on top of a room in the sponsored bit💀💀
it’s a good day when Caryn and Connie post 🙌🙌
I want to hear ALL of the terrible Twilight jokes in 2024.
i should have been a fairy castle
1:23 whalebert house!!
My one complaint about this channel was the lack of twilight jokes, actually so this video was that definitely an improvement
15:56 The “say it,.. out loud” got me. Scratched my brain made me very happy. Much appreciated! 😅🥹
I would love to see more of "Unearth the Urn/Spot the Urn".
I found the urn!!!!
I binge watched all of your videos, NOW WHAT AM I GOING TO TO!?!
yay!! missed you!:)
Make a Autumn witch Castle
Please build a big gothic castle next
I was dreaming about you building a castle since forever! Now MAKE IT BIG 😂 I mean big big like ballroom, hallways, dungeons. I’m here for it 🩷
Has anyone with the new for rent pack (I know that's a bit off topic) tried making a trailer park? I would do it myself but I only have an offline console disk version and can't get the pack
always so so so excited to see an upload from you guys, tysm for just making these videos. i dont really comment often so i dont know what to say but i just love your videos so much.
The urn is in the library :)
where have you been, loca?
I would literally die if they did a bloxburg build for a video
the sim can always crawl over the bed....... Imagien going from the kitchen to the bed room OVER THE BED and into the bathroom just to go poop
"This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella." God, I laughed so hard at that. 😅
That plant overlapping with the candle stand is a fire hazard. XD
Idk why, but when she says "So this is dinning?"  at 11:29 she kinda sounds like Boggo from the Land of Boggo and now I can't unhear it.
just the other day i saw syd mac's vid where she stacked plates to see how high she could go and now i see yall stacking books, yall have the same braincells 🤣 Also love that little book shelf corner the book lover in me is overjoyed
NEWW VIDEOOO BY MY FAVS EVERRRRRR<3333
THE URNNNNNN
Y’all just turned my whole day around by posting
Do you guys have a schedule of when you post? I've never clicked on a video so quickly!
15:24 fun fact, 'dungeons' used to be in the towers of castles, not the basement! So you would be completely in the right for building one here
I know you guys play the sims mostly on here but can you do a house flipper 2 let’s play :) I think you’d love it
id love to see them do a rags to riches
I would love to see a video dedicated to teaching people tips and tricks for decorating, like the whole point is that you’re explaining techniques to people and theres no real goal for the build other than that
The Twilight jokes were greatly appreciated 😂
i literally JUST finished the last video in the builds playlist, came back to check the channel page just in case, and THEY LIVE!!!! :D
It would be cool to have more fantasy-inspired builds, like a fairy village or an astronomers tower
I want terrible twilight jokes in 2024!! 😡😡
Can you please do a Million Dollar Castle build I really enjoyed the million dollar ranch build.
When they said they were going to save the moon rug for later, I thought they were going to make a mediaeval wizard tower lol 🥲
at 11:10 one of the hanging flowers from the oven hood looks suspiciously like foxglove and if that's the case, the knight paid the cook to poison to king definitely edit: the witch princess is planning something...
You’re alive!
NEW VIDEO YAAAASSSSS
I missed my favorite twins!!!!
now do a big one
now i need to see a bigger version of this!!!!!!!!!!!!! its so cute
think it would be cool to make a house but decorate it entirely (or just mostly) with sized-up clutter, like a borrowers house
I personally loved the twilight jokes 15:49
Please do a mansion but it's a pirate ship and themed.
When you stopped cause it was raining heavily, it literally started raining outside, lol 😂
Just started watching yesterday and already caught up, so I’m praising y’all for blessing us with another video today! 🙏🏼🙌🏼
i was feeling a little sick today but your videos always make me feel better <3
I'm feeling the need to a $1,000,000 castle build now
we actually all wanted to hear a terrible twilight joke in 2024 <3
I loved watching you guys have so much fun building this! So excited to see where y'all go with the new kit :D
I am here for twilight jokes in 2024 #rat
I ❤ CARYN AND CONNIE
"Nobody wants to hear a terrible Twilight joke in 2024"  Me: *screams in rattie* ✨🐀✨
You guys make amazing builds! I just found your channel 2 weeks ago and I immediately subscribed. I absolutely love the "vibe" of your videos! Keep it up <3
the urn is in the mini-library!!!
I've been anxiously awaiting another video from you two.  I already love it!
yas twilight refrences 🐀
15:15 "how would that work, we are on the second floor" actually dungeon comes from the word donjon which was a tower so like,
You should make a magic library. One with books, candles, plants, and whimsey!
man im super sick today and this video is the first thing to make me smile
ANOTHER VIDEO YES! (LOVE THE TINY CASTLE IDEA)
For a 1 million sub build you guys could build the 1 million subscriber play button that you can purchase from YT.
I have been checking for a new C&C sims build every day😭😭
lmao love this and the erne was cute
"This is the chandelier of a killer, Bella" had me cackling
Next castle build should have a ballroom so that you can make 5000 jokes about having a ball with the build.
I’ll have you know. I wanted to hear a terrible Twilight joke. (And I liked the video specifically for it. lol)
14:56 *insert toothless dancing here*
I definitely thought they'd put a stargazing room or stargazing balcony on this build.
This build was awesome! What did you use to make the shot-by-shot walkthrough at the end?
URN URN URN!     Its in the bookshelves, you thought you hid it but nooo 😂😂
OMG OMG GAME OF THRONES THEMED CASTLE BUILD. Or a glow up of vlad’s house
Not Caryn placing Whaleburt while Connie talks about her water 😂
Your almost at 1M WOO😆
a new caryn and connie video to end the night, blessed!
I keep checking the Chanel every day I love you guys
The practice of charcuterie dates back to ancient times, when Greeks and Romans would preserve meat for long journeys by salt-curing the meat, then smoking or drying it to further extend its shelf life. The word charcuterie is of French origin.
My Youtube is so confused. Serial killer documentaries and then Sims builds lol
I actually do wanna hear a terrible twilight joke in 2024
now we NEED a million dollar castle
I found waldo and it is on the bottom shelf across from the ladder.
Loved the twilight jokes!
i get so excited when yall upload a new video! this was a great one
This was so awesome start to finish but having the time set to evening made it a little hard to see because of the shadows on the outside. You guys are so inspiring to me! I'm just video-game blind 😂
I have not touched Sims since Sims 3 in years and while I have lost all interest in the game I so enjoy watching you two.  You two are so silly and work together so beautifully.  I am excited to see what you make next.  I am interested in seeing if you make any animal inspired builds in the future.   Also your castle is missing a stable for the horses. lol
The twilight joke😂😂
You guys are backkkk 🤭
here before one mil 👇
i thought it was raining the whole video until you turned off the noise filter because i have hair dye bubbling next to my ear😭
"We're contrary!" me: Connietrary
You should create one of those 'modern château', the outside looks like a château castle but the inside is modernised, it's become really popular in France recently, I've been seeing lots of videos about it on YT
15:57 i gotta say i very much do wanna hear a terrible twilight joke always, keep ‘em coming loca
Maybe you can make an orphanage next lol
I have been looking for a new video everyday and when I saw the post on instagram I clicked so fast!!
Was having a bad day but the planets aligned so now it's one of the top 5 days this year
Found the urn huzzah!!!🎉
MAKE WHALEBERT A HOME 😭
Found the urn! In the magic area on the shelves near the desk!
Was just checking yesterday if you guys uploaded anything lately. So happy to have received the notification that Caryn & Connie uploaded 😭❤️
Genuinely, watching two sims players just have fun and make things for their own enjoyment is so healing.
Absolutely perfect, girls. Knocked it out of the park as always!
I saw the pack release and knew I was gonna get a treated to a new video
Is it weird that my eyes immediately caught the urn ? 😭 lmao amazing build as always!!
Not me waiting for you to put in an urn the whole time 🙈 glad I stayed until the end of the video hahah
The charcuterie board was invented in 15th century France. And medieval century ended around 1400-1450 Conclusion: yes. Medieval people invented charcuterie boards.   13:30
URN SPOTTED.
The Twilight jokes were loco, bellas!
It just hit me you have realized the aesthetic-build dream of a highly detailed castle build. Huzzah.
I know they said they’d never do a large build like the horse ranch again, but I want a giant castle estate so bad 😫
"Rocks and Ruins" is gonna be my new book title, and no I totally didnt steal it 👀
It’s sad you didn’t add gargoyles to the castle from the vampire set.
Ok hear me out on this challenge: Build a standard house, then deconstruct it into seperate rooms, each out u gets to build 1 room at a time and not look at each others rooms as u go.  Then come together to put it all together.   You can not tell each out what u did and what should be what like bedroom, bathroom ect.  And figure out the jumbled mess at the end.😂
bookshelf urn, baby!
lmao whalebert getting his time to shine in the sponsor segment
loooove this, im a sucker for fantasy builds so i had high hopes for this vid when i got the notif (you guys nailed It)!! my fav sims yters
No access to the big balcony for an easel was criminal!! Other than that, GORGOUS!!! Need you guys to do a full size castle now :D
They're back!
i would 100% watch videos witj rain noise or like no commentary full length time building with the  rain like those cozy Minecraft 4 hour videos lol
Yayyyy! Finally a new video 🎉
The Twilight jokes had me giggling, good job
i need morrreeee videos lol
What world is this?
Could you guys please put subtitles on your video? Like, the whole video.
I wish ya'll would post more!
fun fact: charcuterie boards originated in 15th century france and since the middle ages lasted until the late 1400s, yes! they were technically made in the medieval times
Considering that these two are identical twins, I actually hadn't even realized that they were related at all until recently! I just remember being taken by surprise by how similar their voices sounded sometimes where I couldn't tell who was talking, but that was it. I'd love to see them either switch hairstyles/glasses with one another, or do an identical hairstyle/outfit day so we can see them at their peak identical twinning!

I went back to hunt for the urn and I'm not ashamed.
I can't be the only one who wants to see a build dedicated to Whalebert :D
idk how to say this without being parasocial or oversharing but your videos greatly increase my will to live.   i can be having a breakdown and ill see a new upload and suddenly im just like hey. maybe life's not so bad.

not me thinking she said “feral trash can” and having to check MULTIPLE TIMES to be sure she didn’t
Did you know that instead of moats, olden day castles just had pits around their castles so attackers would just fall in?
Please do the tangled tower
Now I will not accept any builds without an urn lmao
yyyyYEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Please do a sims build where every single room is 1 tile
My boyfriend asked if you uploaded a new video because he didn’t recognize the one on the TV, so maybe I rewatch your videos too often, but that won’t stop me I loved the build, spotted the urn, and can’t wait to see what’s next :)
THE QUEENS HAVE RETURNED!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
