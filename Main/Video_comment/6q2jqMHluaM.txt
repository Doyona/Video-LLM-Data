Please someone, ANYONE tell me where to find that jacket shes wearing !
Thank you for sharing this, I relate to this so much!!!
I’m so happy you’re feeling better, you’re only human and everyone deserves a rest, you’re the purest soul and such a lovely person, and whoever says otherwise is jealous and completely wrong. Sending so much love❤️❤️
i feel for you with getting ill. i got covid and it meant i lost my job and driving test appt. hopefully you can recover 😘
this was so chill
Didnt she have covid?
It might as well be the stomach flu, doesn't have to be food poisoning
'CALL MEBY YOUR NAMEEE TELL ME YOU LOVE ME IM SORRYYYYY' okay no im sorry these are the new lyrics
me typing in on spotify more than a woman vibes
Flies lay eggs
As a 20 y/o gal myself, the self esteem stuff is tough enough without being judged on the internet. Huge respect to you for talking about it. Sending hugs!💛
have you started new medication recently?
We 🧡 u flossie, I’m so sorry you’re going through this and it’s heartbreaking to see you so upset 💞💞 sending you love

7:10 fancy lewys
Flossie, don't listen to the haters! don't take criticism from someone you would go to for advice! ❤️
YAAAAAWN. She loves her YouTube channel and her social media as it bring in the cash and pays the bills, yet can’t face the comments etc. That’s what comes with the job love, why do you think you’re living in a penthouse in London? Girls fucking stealing a wage man. Get a real job or face the music and get over it
texting and driving???:/
if you're ugly then everyone is ugly lmaoo you're literally so conventionally stunning what is wrong with people
Take as much time as you need gorg and never feel guilty for it xxxx
Sending love 🥺
You are beautiful 💕💕💕
😕
Every time I watch flossies videos I don’t even realise but I’ll start talking with her accent 😂🤗 the amount of times where my family is like “why are you talking with an accent “ and I’m like 👀 . Anyway thought that was funny love you flossie! And your voice! 🤓.
Jesus these girls are freaks
love and appreciate you even tho i dont know you personally! 😘
love you miss gurl x
Bore offff 🥱
Your videos are the only video I don’t skip through hahaha
I love you :)
looool is that dude using his phone whilst driving? running someone over is big on tiktok now or somethin?
You came up randomly
Please stop apologising for having feelings! Your feelings are valid, prioritise yourself & your mental health before anything🤍Sending you lots of love :)
WHAT.A.QUEEN. x
Does anyone know where olivias  leather jacket is from !!!!
Never missed you and might not see you again. No need to worry  will not loose any sleep over itnot missing you already.
Also I love your coat, where is it from!😍
you are so beautiful
Omg hearing your voice break🥺💔ur beauts hun, hope ur ok! Xx
I really wish I could give you a hug and make you believe how truly beautiful inside and out no matter what, you are human and even on your worst days you look incredible to me and you should never forget that you actually are perfect and the people that hate on you don’t really know you at all, the real person that you are is the person that not even your friends and family believe you are but who you people you are
Its really upsetting that people can say nasty things to you 😩💔 girl your amazing 🦋 beautiful, I know it's hard to ignore the comments but you just have to feel sorry for haters because they are obviously hating there own lives 😌 always be kind ✌️ and things will get better 💘
Anytime someone becomes big on a platform the negative comments start flooding in... it's all jealousy
These trending video bloggers need to learn to articulate language properly...it sounds like she is talking in double Dutch....me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me...
breaks are needed we don’t blame you, I hope you’re feeling lighter soon 💞
Ignore the comments. If you haven't got haters you ain't doing well
we love a mature queen
Flossie your energy is divine… always protect it 🥰🥰
Hope you are doing better BABE❤️ its okay to take time for you🙏
Thank you for this blog. My comfort content 😌😌😌
How much do you pay to get on trending?
your amazing, love ya hun
How is this shit trending
every time you talk about bad comments you get I’m always so confused as there’s nothing wrong with you! Shows that people get hateful at people they wish they could be more like
missed you so so much, hope your feeling better now, just always remember how amazing and beautiful  you are, love you always xx
Why the hell has this garbage showed up in my recommended?
I wish people would stop being so critical about YouTubers like no one makes you watch them if you like their content watch them if you don’t no one has forced you.
I don't understand how this girl gets hate. I genuinely think she seems so lovely! I just think she's the type of girl I would love to be best friends with. Hope you're okay Flossie- difficult times pass, they always do <3
Love the editing in this video, also hope you are ok flossie. Self care always ❤️
Missed your vlogs hope your feeling better 🤍🤍 your new nails are lush 😍
Plz talk about stuff like this more it’s literally just facts
Chavtastic...
I could just take this video to the police and matey boy would be naffed for being on his phone
My fave thing is chilling watching your videos Flossie🥺 We're so glad you're feeling better, you're so loved by all of us, plus your amazing friends and family, remember that! And Flossie - you're human! Of course the negativity will get to you, and no-one can ever say that they'd be able to ignore it, you're doing amazing and the best thing you can do is keep on making content because you enjoy doing so! We love you so so so much and you're so strong❤️xxx  (ps Lewys PLEASE get off your phone whilst driving, those texts can wait, that's such a stupid and thoughtless thing to do when you're literally putting yours and others lives at risk!)
You wanna concentrate on telling flannel boy to get off his damn mobile while driving. Cause your family will be retail shopping for funeral clothes otherwise. 👍
Well wishing i was living flossies life
does anyone know where her jacket is from? 6:10
You are so good 👍 💓 💗
nails shouldnt be so flat bc then they broke easier but still amazing work really
What lipstick are you wearing?
Where is your black coat from? Xx
Flossie you are so beautiful. I love your videos so much. ☺️
everyone feels like this at some point don’t be sorry we understand and hope you’re okay ❤️❤️
you’re only human girl. you got this, you the prettiest and baddest b:) you’ve come really far and remember, there’s more positivity than negativity. don’t let that 5% get you down, not worth your time when you’re doing bigger and better things than those who are leaving those comments xoxo
Love this vlog feel like u where chill
Get well soon floss xx
i really recommend taking a proper break, "workaway" is a great place to start it is a volunteer exchange (you can literally go anywhere) i dont know i think it would just really help to put everything into perspective. you are so lucky to have so much freedom so use that time to explore, meet new people and learn new things!!!!! being on your phone constantly issss sooooo detrimental to your mental wellbeing
love you flossie whenever i watch your videos you light up people’s days and are in an inspiration to all x lave you babes
It’s okay to have bad days/ weeks. We all have them just know you have so many supporters who support you 💗💗
Okay but Where is that dress from?? It’s stunning
How could anyone say anything bad about this girl she’s gorgeous
Love you so so so much floss queen 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Where is that black jacket from plsssss - it's GAWJUS
Please where is your jacket from!!!! I couldn’t find it on urban or Zara is it sold out???
Love you Flossie. Your nails are gorgeous and so are you. Missed your vlogs. Feel better babe. Xxxxxx
literally how could anyone be mean to flossie like she just radiates kindness. such a beautiful girl
It’s super hard for you as such a young girl to be practically growing up but in the public eye, that’s so difficult, because not everyone will understand that. Peoples personality’s change all the time, looks and just everything changes when you’re growing up! You’re probably doing better than 80% of 20 year olds in the world Floss! Hope u feel better soon, fuck negative people they’re trash xx
MISSED HEARING YOUR VOICE FLOSSIE AHHHH MAKES ME SO SAD THAT YOU CANT SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE GIRL😍😍😍🥰🥰💖💖💖💕💕💕
Sending love to you Flossie ❤️
She is so beautiful inside and out, I wish she didn't get these sad times :(
flossie, it’s completely OKAY to take a break 🤍 people go on breaks and go on leave with 9-5 jobs and so can you. sometimes we do need to take a step back. we all love you and your mental well-being is number one to us and more important than regular uploads. sending love.
Anyone else think flossie has never looked better! You’re so beautiful
how come they don’t wear masks?
Stay strong angel!🤍 people that leave negative comments are clearly sad individuals, weird behaviour honestly<3 we love u
Does anyone know what  that style of coat is called?💗
Love your videos Flossie can i get a shoutout love you queen💕❤️🥰
You have no idea how much your videos bring up my mood
what was the Spotify playlist Flossie mentioned?  Adore you! Xx
my mind can not wrap around the idea that anyone on this whole entire plant could find you ugly like i actually cannot understand that.
I can see the pure genuineness and hurt when you talk about how things get to you, and how online doesn’t always feel like a safe space and it honestly hurts my heart watching it. Our situations are definitely incomparable but I can resonate when it comes to struggling mentally with social media. It honestly took years to figure out, with a lot of “social media cleanses”, and I feel I’ve come to a really healthy place with it by having deleted all social platforms except for facebook and messenger. I love coming to your channel, for more reasons than one.  Even though you’re 4 years younger than me (although that’s not much of a gap), I’m constantly drawn in to admire your articulacy and intellectual perspective on the world and within yourself. Your soul literally speaks to me and I’m finding how much I value that as I get older, it’s a part of who I am which I’ve not always found easy to love and accept.  You’re so unapologetically you and I can’t tell you how much I admire to be that way, one day. I see strength and stability, not to mention what an attractive trait that is. On that note, although it’s a work in progress, find ways to release that pressure and fear surrounding taking time off. You do, whatever the fuck you need to do, for you. Especially during the uncertain and anxiety inducing times a lot of us are having surrounding the pandemic and tragic world events. Thank you for being the incredible lady you are, sending you a whole lot of love ✨💛
We love you so much Flossie!!! Youre such a gorgeous person! You're definitely one of my idols/girl crushes ❤️ Alway remember haters are just fans x
You’re such a beautiful soul and really good person, you never brag about anything and you’re grateful for everything. Every time I watch your videos I get such good vibes from you. Hope you can work through it. Sending love from Argentina 💛💛
Hope you get through 2021 and I would love to see some more vlogs as well I love your channel too
We love you, Flossie. You deserve the world! 💝
You talking in the catch up was actually stunning
I'm a strong, confident, grown ass woman, but I could never do what you do. I couldn't invite folks in with their opinions. What you're doing is hard, and it takes a thick skin. You're amazing and you're doing better than you think babe, I hope this low moment sorts itself out soon xx
Where did Olivia get that black jacket from! Xx
we love u so much
🤍🤍
Her pop it open song so suits the spot dream metaphor. Also for my own self satisfaction, let’s appreciate the lyric ‘drive a foreign and I still feel poor’ and shame flossy for buying expensive shit jokes love her bye
Sounds like you’ve got norovirus babes x
Thank you so much! Please don't apologise for taking some time off. You're so beautiful and you deserve the best. Honestly you brighten up my day and I totally understand how you feel. Loved this video! xx
i love you so much  xxxxxxxxx sending love
I'm so happy you have a support group that are also influencers so they know exactly how you feel and how to help. I get that there's always going to be a disconnect from followers and sometimes the love from comments can't go as far as it would in person. Bless Lewys for supporting you.
There is no excuse to ever leave hate but how can you hate on someone so pretty
what is with people commenting hate to floss? She is gorgeous and radiates nothing but kindness. People really have nothing else to do
Flossie you’re a weapon ⚡️
where is your watch from?? Xx
i love these lot each of their videos make me feel so comforted and less lonely like i’m out with my mates 🥺
You are such a beautiful human being and the fact that we can all see that through a screen and we can feel your energy makes me know that you genuinely are such an amazing person. Please don’t EVER feel bad about needing to take care of yourself, please don’t think that you ever owe us every part of your life if you don’t want to, you will always be a beautiful person to us no matter what you’re doing xx Love you flossie! Always put YOURSELF first 💕
aw flossie love u sm and supporting u always🤍
girllll wear your seatbelt!!
I think you should hire someone to go through the comments and delete the horrible ones not even slightly joking   You can hire me if you want!  I’ll do it for £7 an hour!!!!
I literally went into that exact & other stories a week ago and bought something, nice cardigan but I caught covid on that trip lmao
Okay 3 things:  1) humans have this horrific way of focusing on one negative comment over 1000 positive ones, it’s so hard to move past it but PLEASE try and remember that although not everyone may like you in this world, if they’re making horrible comments they are no loss to you ❤️   2) I am SO sorry you do need feel safe online and most of all your own job, no one should have to deal with that. It’s  awful that people are abusing what they’ve been given to bring you down.   3) I find you and your channel so comforting and you ARE the Flossie you, your friends and your family love ❤️ you bring people joy and provide a break from hard times, and there is so much love here for you x  We’re the same age and I cannot believe what you have to deal with, you’re doing amazing ❤️
Someone’s opinion of you isn’t reality.
I can’t believe you get that many negative comments about your looks !! Me and my best friend have spoke about you for years and always talk about how naturally beautiful you are !! We would give anything to look like you !! Crazy how people can be so bitter
Girl you r a queen do what you want and put yourself above anything
anyone know where olivia’s jeans are from?? :))
People’s perception of u is a reflection of themselves <3
you are more than enough just by being you ❤️
bruv is she going to talk about court or what
Here as one of many positive comments to drown out the haters✌🏼We love u floss. u are one of the most genuine, down to earth, kind youtubers. i really look up to u, i really do. keep your head high gorg. you are beautiful, strong, independant and successful and i love u lots babe xx
You feel so real here. keep up the good work <3
the coat is giving though, i loveeee
what’s the model of the dr martens called?
‘Really unwell’ she got covid
It honestly angers me so much that people have the audacity to make others feel like this! Easier said than done, but please pitty them rather than believe what they’re saying - their bad comments says a lot about them and nothing about you. Flossie you’re lovely x
Feel better :)
I totally understand! But don't listen to shitty people
where is your coat from!!!
I love you xxxxxx
I loved the realness  in this…. I actually cried. It means a lot to see big YouTubers be genuine
💕💕💕💕
You are an amazing person Flossie self-care is really important so please do take the time for a break & look after yourself ❤️ thank you for being you & take care
This may be weird but I have a list in my notes of people who I want to be more like and inspire me and you're on It. Don't ever let these negative people put you done, you're worth so much to so many people :)
“Gave birth” laid eggs babe x
Flossie is gorgeous and don't ever let them put u down babes x
I hope flossie knows that acrylic nails are meant to have an apex and not be flat!! That’s why her nails break all the time 😢
Love you even more now Flossie, you can’t have physical health without mental health! Thank you for opening up to us <3
The ‘good morning babes’ hit different. What an actual cutie!!!
so happy you’re back! ❤️
Australian flossie
I love you ❤
love u bestie
Hi Flossie!! I know it’s easier said than done but ignore the hurtful and horrible comments! No words can describe how wonderful you are! I don’t think any words can describe how much you inspire me or everyone else who watches your videos! You allow me to live the life I want to through your videos! The love and support you get will always outnumber the hurtful messages and comments people leave you! You’re so strong and thank you for not giving up! Take as many breaks and as many days off you need! You’re a star! You’re an icon! But most importantly you’re Flossie❤️
My heart just warms for you!! You are clearly such a pure, beautiful person on the inside. You work so hard and look at you with all your achievements and all the good karma you have received. Sending you love 💓
You’re a human being Flossie! As someone who is older, it’s super encouraging to see young influencer like you being so vulnerable…keeping it real. Positivity culture only goes so far but real growth and setting a genuine example is being vulnerable and transparent with your human condition. You’re special and wonderful! Love this video. Xo
I love your vlogs! Can we be friends!!!
ok but you are literally THE PRETTIEST person ever. like not only you're stunning but your aura as well, just immaculate. honestly one of my fave people ever and your videos always help get me through the rough patches. we love you and support you no matter what flossie <3
I’m so sorry you’ve been made to feel this way Flossie breaks my heart to see you look so teary and hurt, you’re such a beautiful girl inside and out! Those mean comments are on them and not you! Thankyou for all the lovely videos you do and all the effort you make! 💓💓💓💓💓💓
It’s okay to feel like this everyone once and a while flossie, but remember you are achieving such amazing things at such a young age and we as you’re supporters are SO SO SO proud of you💜
Love ya floss
missed you!!🤍
Does anyone know where her coat is from? I am         o b s e s s e d! 😮‍💨
You're amazing. girl! Don't listen to hate comments. know your worth. you deserve to do the  job you're passionate about. Your true fans support you and will never write hate comments, remember that.
We're all here for you Flossie! Remember, for every one nasty person who feels the need to make other people feel as shit as they do, there are thousands more that love you and whose days are made better by what you do xx
Ive missed you sm flossie, but your happiness should always come first and people who comment horrible things are disgusting and you don’t deserve all the hate. Love you lots, where all here for you!! xxxxx
How anyone can make a negative comment anything on you is beyond me. You've literally got a stunning smile and are just all round gorgeous.
weird question floss but have you had your covid vaccine in the past few days because I felt exactly the same after my vaccine- really sick and hot and cold chills
Other people's negativity is not on you! It's on them. Don't let them drag you down beautiful girl 😘
This is just a reminder that every single type of worker takes a break (there's exception cause you know, capitalism) but we should all take breaks! We take breaks from school, work, and even just life, it isn't being lazy, it isn't normal to work all the time, it isn't healthy. Anyways, don't apologize for taking breaks and also, hope you're feeling better! I've had a bit of a down time since earlier this year but a few weeks ago was able to pick myself back up.
Ignore anyone negative you are so amazing ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I AM OBSESSED WITH YOU
I LOVE doing my make up on the floor! I've done it for many many years! lol
love you babes hope your feeling better
Hello🌼
icon glad u took time for yourself we totally understand xx
FLOSSIE YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT 💗💗💗💗💗
im sorry, but how could someone not like you? either way, what people say of you, is a reflection of them, not you 💕 sending you positive vibes and love xx
Flossie I’m so so sorry you have to go through this, I really am sending you so much love and hugs
you’re the one that chose to put yourself on the internet and if you need a break you take it. we are only here to watch and be entertained and we appreciate that because you are out source of entertainment but we want you to want to be filming and being happy and not put it on. I think I can speak for most people when I say that your honesty is so important and we all really appreciate it. and also we are all human, we all go through phases where we don’t want to or want to do things, it’s normal and I think people fail to recognise that. thank you flossie <3
I adore you bro 🥺 makes me so sad that people can suck so much but I’m glad you’re back. I also really appreciate you talking about this so openly because it definitely made me feel less alone ❤️
We are all just happy you’re back💖
one of the prettiest girls i’ve ever seen
Jealousy because there is absolutely nothing wrong with you inside or outside, you are an amazing individual ♥️
flossie and olivia are the prettiest best friends i've ever seen
no one should have to experience hate i’m sorry xx
girl it's okay. Your wellbeing matters more than anything else. Take your time and take care 😘
I love the editing style, it’s clear you’re getting back into the swing of things, get well soon!!
ur so stunning inside and out snd i’m so sorry peiple treat u and comment shit. u don’t deserve it one bit 💖
So many people love you so much, focus on that🤍🤍🤍 People who throw hate around are just jealous of the ray of sunshine you are❤️
ily flossie
You’ve kept a smile on my face for years now, and honestly your videos were the only thing that kept a smile on my face in lockdown especially. You genuinely are so much more than what some jealous people write on the internet, about your looks or whatever because i swear you are worth so much more than that. You are beautiful and you have a beautiful life if you need to distance yourself from social media to maintain your happiness, please do. Take care of you <3
we’ll always love u, ignore the haters ik it’s hard but you’re a queen💗💗
girl take a break if needed please don’t stress yourself out we’re glad to have u back beautiful💞💞
We missed you angel, sorry for the negative people out there. Love you 🤍
Hope you feel better!!! Take all the time off you need to feel 100%!! Just know you owe nothing to anyone, live for yourself and take care of yourself!!

I wanna give you a huge hug! You will ALWAYS have an army of love behind you! Know that negative comments are from people who are miserable themselves they've actually got nothing to do with you! ILY <3
People have something negative to say about everything, a lot of the time its no reflection on you whatsoever. Be kinder to yourself girl, you're doing amazing xx
