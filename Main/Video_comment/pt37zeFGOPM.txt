This guy has fallen off so hard
Is no one even going to mention that ball was never over the line lol
okaypt
where is CR7
How United didn't win this game I don't know. Says a lot when Chelseas first highlight was the 87th minute.
2:29
Who supports Chelsea well I do
United were way better team, would of been a crime if we lost this match
i must commend GP for making the change when he did
Best cdm ilg❤ CASEMRIO
Why were we charged for explaining to the ref it wasn’t a pen what an actual joke 🤬
WOW both goals in this game left late good header from casermiro
Man united are so lucky to get a draw against us Casemiro didn't deserve to score
Casemiro hugged Keane and got even more passion than ever.
Mount was really looking for a fight with Martinez
Chelsea have a pen merchant
5 Draws In a Row for both clubs And still no win decider
Great effort from Keppa
Imagine next season, Casemiro settled in, a full PL season under his belt, has Rice/Bellingham as his midfield partner. And Bruno just ahead of them. Lethal midfield trio!
Nobodys talking about Kepas performance 🔥
Chelsea need Endrik , KTBFFH 💙🤙
lucky Mancs 😂
Kepa has defo improved or at least not the nightmare he was a couple of seasons ago and lisandro maybe the smallest defender man utd have but he's massive for utd
They got lucky
We controlled the game the whole way through it was obvious Martinez is a beast what a header casemiro
Potter still has not done anything that TT could have done over those games, he is still trying to fit in 'the perceived best and expensive' players. Gallacher, Broja + Pulisic should all be playing. Sterling has been terrible, Auba looks well short of what we need and Mount needs time out. Until this is rectified, we will be the same as last year, draw after draw. We've been very careless dropping 2 pts to spurs and 2 pts to man u in the final minute. Potter needs to take the game to man u, man c + liverpool, then we will see if he's the right man or not. I'm far from convinced until he changes the players, why we bought cucurella is baffling, chilly the better player by far.
No one seems to be talking about the fact that Man Utd have played all 5 other 'big six' teams in their first 11 games whereas rest of them still have 2-3 big six teams to face. Man Utd will probably be up there with City and Arsenal when it gets to half way.
If I was CR7, I'd switch over to City and play for FREE .. just to show United the middle finger for being so disrespectful to a legend.
Wasnt even over the line in any camera angle. Shocking again from the ref tech.. no even a chelsea fan.
As a chelsea fan I'm getting frustrated with Potter need to keep changing the team and playing players out of position it's like he hasn't got a clue who plays wear this will end badly.
United celebrating like they just won the champions league ahahahhah bunch of wettys   Kepa so unfortunate to not save that
Celebrating an equaliser in a league game like it's a world cup final. THIS IS MANCHESTER UNITED
Chelsea didn’t deserve anything from this just like they didn’t deserve to beat Aston Villa they just got lucky today
Souness is hiding
Why isn't Harry Maguire playing, United games are boring without him
CASE BLUDCLUT MIRO! 👏🔥
Casemiro: What a player!
Lol, you just gotta laugh at frustrated rags ..... they manage to scrape a last gasp draw in injury time against probably the worst chelsea team in years, and they go beserk like they've won the league title !
Classemiro
Rashford is poor get Ronaldo on ffs wtf
Mctommanay is a liability. Useless
He, and you  know who He was reminded me of Mr Scholes, assured and talented , i hope he likes it here, he like our man will make the tean great.
All props to Casemiro but from the United fan’s comments you guys are totally blind. You drew 1-1 and think the team is amazing. You’ve got a world star player sitting on the bench, the same player who was your top scorer last year. You possibly cannot think not having him the starting line up is a good decision when you’re not even winning games. If he wasn’t Ronaldo would you still be ok with him being in the bench even though he is literally a goal machine? Think now, you’ve got a team with a beautiful history and at the moment you’re not doing well, you’re best striker is on the bench, the simple decision is to play him as much as you can. Build the team around him if you have to as long as he’s banging goals in 🤦‍♂️
It's a shame Kepa's name isn't pronounced Keeper.
Martin Tyler's commentry when Cas scored the equaliser is shocking. Time to retire old yin
mctominay needs to leave. he is young and I am sure he will have a good career but he is not good enough at his age for a top team.
Casemiro and Sergej Milinkovic Savic both would be 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
Little kepa
This delusional Ten Haag was put Casemiro on the bench! This is crazy! Casemiro start at 11 in any team in the world. Fantastic player!
amazing to hear the united fans still chanting "viva ronaldo" during his suspended game
Another game another 1 vs 1 chance that rashford misses. It honestly hurts me inside watching Rashford play over Ronaldo. Rashfords finishing hasn't been bad this season alone, its been like this for years. How ETH is not resolving issues with Ronaldo and not starting him over Rashford is beyond me
Casemiro celebrating like he’s won the World Cup over a draw 🤣
Only thing about Antony is he needs to overlap more. So many times in the first half Dalot had it in great positions to overlap and get a cross in or even dribble the line and win a corner but went backwards or sideways a ton cause he couldn’t come onto his left foot
Nobody talking about Kepa? Bros back
Mc Yellow again giving away pens, his only talent is getting booked.
The manager needs tell off Sancho and Rushford, cause they lack ambition and craft in games when we control they do nothing!!!!! From 90 minutes they only give a good 10 - 15 minutes of quality the rest are wasted. So disappointing specially with Sancho with the talent that he has. Very poor
Can we just sell ras
please don't play Mctominay again
I know Casemiro stole the show but Luke Shaw had a great game
McGuire
Softest penalty ever. Absolute joke.
Rashford got into some great positions that were wasted by his teammates' inability to see it.  You see two examples in this video, even if on one occasion they find him but too late and the keeper can close him down.  This is where teams like Man City are always looking for how to find Haaland and seem to really understand how to do it.
Still I missed Ronaldo’s input 😭😭
Had to sit in the Chelsea Supporters end as a United fan. Stayed as quiet as Anne Frank throughout the game but could barely hold it in on the Casemiro goal. Glad to see everyone around me disappointed. They were all annoying dossers the whole game anyways.
All United fans bigging up casamero but why no one talking above when kosavic came on you didn’t even see man uniteds midfield since was all Chelsea he bosses the midfield
If kepa kept that off the line
Cr7 is bigger than man u
Last night’s Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester United is WWE of English football with all the heroes from Hulk Hogan to Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart and villains from Ric Flair to The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan could beat Ric Flair, Bret ‘The Hitman’ Hart could beat Jerry ‘The King’ Lawler, ‘Macho Man’ Randy Savage could beat Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts, Big Boss Man could beat Mr Perfect, The Ultimate Warrior could beat The Undertaker, British Bulldog could beat The Mountie, Stone Cold Steve Austin could beat Vince McMahon and The Rock could beat Triple H in WWE.
Feel bad for kepa that would have been some save
Liverpool fan here and must admit watching kepa get a game for Chelsea and do well is good to see the kids stuck in there and deserves his chance
Rashford isn't good enough.
The passion when United equalised was immense.. ETH has got this group fighting and I can feel the start of something great for United. That's Arsenal, Liverpool, spurs and Chelsea out the way now and we've taken points of them all. Keep this momentum and United will be fine
McDonaldsinay 😈😈
Please give Rashford an eight year contract. We can't lose players like him, and Martial. Both are absolutely...I can't think of the word; useless, worthless, obsolete, absent.
I feel bad for kepa he kept 5 clean sheets in a row only for the streak to be broken by a flukey goal
If Chelsea got the win that wouldn’t have been fair because you’d know that if you watched the full game. Man U were better for most of it. A draw is about right
Chelsea got so lucky to that get that point. We played them out of the park. Gutted we didn’t get the 3 points we so rightly deserved.
Even tho a draw vs chelsea isnt bad, we really should have been able to capitalise in the first half and score our chances because we dominated at least the first 35 minutes
Ive said this multiple times before, and I'll continue to say it....Get McTomminay out of that Utd team ASAP!!!
Ronaldo scores goals
No one going to talk about how Mctominay needs to bounce
Ronaldo would have finished those chances and scored a hat trick today
Controlled and dominated but not won because our goal scorer was not on Crazy Ronaldo should always start
KEPA IS A NEW MAN!!!
Is nobody going to talk about how awful Sancho has been? Everybody hated on Pepe for arsenal and he got twice the stats Sancho has
Ronaldo on in the 80th minute would of been a different story
Very lucky for United to get the draw, from 35 mins onwards chelsea dominated proceedings, decent game tho
City game transformed united 🤣
I know he got a lot of stick for his height but Martinez is actually a beast
Casemiro didn’t celebrate like that when he won the champions league!! What a player !!
Casemiro will always bring balance to any midfield for utd and Brasil.
Well, when Niall Quinn got manhandled in 2002 it was a solid penalty, so is this.
Man it'd absolutely battered Chelsea how was this 1-1 😆 🤣 😂
I gonna say it and I'm gonna keep saying it..... Rushford is not a world class striker and definitely not good enough for Manchester United standards
No Chelsea fan should be happy with this result! You were very poor! It’s just a shame Rashford can’t finish 😂
Skysports highlights are the worst! Put the timer up!!!
Utd fans will lie to themselves like this was a masterclass when really they dodged a bullet again
Martin Tyler really needs to stop commentating
Rashord shouldn't be at a top club,  his finishing is terrible and as a winger he doesn't do that position well either
Lisandro Martinez Is the player we have needed at the back for the last 5 years. What a player
Neville 😂 “how he guides it into the far corner” . It just about scraped over the line 😂😂😂 so blatantly bias it’s actually annoying
I turned off the game when the penalty was given because I don't understand why Scott or Fred are still playing for my team when they constantly cost us games. The corner also came from elenga passing it to nobody down the other end
United deserved to win
Casemiro is one of the best signing Man United have ever made
Kepa finally beaten. Hopefully Chelsea wake up and move the ball quicker now
That was a strikers finish, what a goal what a player
Casemiro brilliant player
90 mins of my life il never get back, 2 awful teams
Man Utd deserved a goal in the first half
Ronaldo plays Utd win
Shame MUFC are looking so much better now. It looked like they were going for the double- relegation and bankruptcy.
Quite a boring game tbh. Don’t no why potter picked that team and formation to start with, terrible line up, glad he tweeted it half way through tho otherwise we wouldn’t even of scored
mctominay doing mctominay things
Celebrations slightly over the top, only drew to a lukewarm Chelsea team relax 😂
Ball never crossed the line
Ronaldo can take the credit for this result...if he Hadn't have walked off like he did then they would not have been motivated for this game!!!!  LMAO 😂🤣🤣😂
A lot of players playing for these types of penalty’s recently. How 2 arms around you makes both your legs fly up behind you, I’ll never know ha BUT don’t put your arms around a player in the box
Gotta hand it to potter his tactics didn't work he changed it and we played really well
European Championships Penalty miss players Sancho and Rashford very poor again, overrated, demand big wages then are just average players, typical
Thoughts with varane😢 we are gna miss him
Shaws ball for Casemiro goal was class. He’s a new player.
CFC pretty much always seem to get a poor decision or 2 in their favour whenever they play Utd. In no other game is that penalty ever going to be given. Justice done to an extent in the end, however if not for Kepa, who has to be man of the match, CFC would have been beaten heavily!
If that’s a penalty…..looking forward to refs giving 8 a game for the rest of the season. Consistency of officiating is just atrocious 😭
You the man cashmiro 👊👊 I was like has he scored,has he not scored,did it over the line,did it not go over the line 🤣🤣
Man United look all round better and are playing for each other without the one trick pony Mardy Ronaldo
Martinez is the don, up the ducking reds!!
This is unbelievable but itc reality never say die until
I’m not surprised that Ronaldo stormed off the other day considering he can’t get a game ahead of Rashford at the moment.
Cristiano Ronaldo not on bench because his early departure last week 🤣🤣 that one hit hard
We definitely need striker like Halaand  the amount of chances rashford misses it’s unbelievable
Anthony becoming too predicatble on the right wing. Any defender with half a brain knows his next move. Going to have to experiment swapping him with sancho to keep defense guessing? Practice whipping crosses? Can't have stagnant attacks like this going forward
Good to see fergie time is alive and well. Away from home as well now.
Listened to TSport MU supporting presenter whining all evening about the pen and how there are 5 in every game not given, no consistency bla bla. Oh dear. If that's not given, refs on championship next week. Show me the 5 like that in every game. McT is caught out and he's grabbed him with the ball coming towards striker.
How can fans not have more sympathy for ronaldo when he gets frustrated at watching his replacement miss so many great chances.
Most boring game ever
Are we going to talk about how Degea is terrible at saving penalties .
I honestly believe if we had Ronaldo we would have won today
Var is ruining goal celebrations.
No ones talking about the injury to varane. Feel awful for him as he's most likely missing the wc. Was an emotional moment for him
Ronaldos not perfect, but how can you treat the greatest player of all time like this?
Casemiro scored yet commentator said McTominay is there ! Eh ?
Kepa deserved a clean sheet so unlucky not to keep it out he’s been on form lately. Good header tho
United need a better striker than rashford
United mopped the floor with Chelsea should have won comfortably   United are improving fast 👏 brilliant 👏
United via the Highlights deserve sum thing from the game against Chelsea.....
1:00 another poor touch from rashy, literally the difference between a good striker and great one. I like rashy but I wanna see clinical finishing he’s 25/26 and just like the game against spurs it’s poor touches or shots straight at the keeper. This is not good enough what do we work on in the off season?
Classic header from our cass
First decent transfer window for United in years and it’s showing…Casemiro, Martinez, Eriksen have all been immense
We finally have that DM we’ve needed for ten years.
Two average looking teams
Sterling just shoot!!!! So jarring man how come players are scared to shot when they come to Chelsea just bare dead touches for the sake of it. He had a stinker and so did Chilly tbf.
Utd should won
Kepa's redemption season, very unlucky for that to bounce in at the end but props to him for not just leaving us and giving his all.
Mctom giving that pen was more disrespect to the defenders who played so well than ronaldo walking off early.
Sell Fred & Mctominay both are poor quality players and surplus to requirements.
the noise from the United fans at the end gave me goosebumps
Never been so embarrassed and seen us get dominated like we did, even after been given a hand out with 9 mins to go we looked like losing, Potter got done very easily today and he will do well to keep his head afloat
We are doomed, arsenal, united and even newcastle seem better placed to finish ahead of us
Chelsea didn't even deserve a draw, man united dominated just like against Tottenham and should have won.
Now United need a world class striker
Lisandro Martinez - what a player ❤️
That passion from Casemiro tho! What a player.. Literally a dream come true for United fans🙏
Absolutely colossal from Kepa, Chelsea are missing Ng and James big time. We need to find real alternatives like we have with Chilli and Cucu.
I'm not a man u fan but I've been quite fond of watching these highlights. But these last few games the amount of simple chances Rashford has had that any other big striker would have scored has been embarrassing. I'm not quite sure why he keeps getting played because he's not capitalising.
Ronaldo would have scored that chance rashford had
I can't wait when Todd B sacked this useless manager he's not world class the performance under him is getting woser everytime i believe Todd B made a mistake in sacking Tuchel and should gave him more time
As I expected, Chelsea players lacking PR in the comments again.  The game was a draw, talk about the player that kept Chelsea in the game ONCE AGAIN. When will Kepa get recognition? When he makes a mistake, because its apart of the agenda against him. He was man of the match in this game
We should’ve put the game to bed in the first half alone. Such a shame to only come out with 1 point but away from home I’ll take it.
We may have drawn but that goal by Casimero felt like we won 😍
I hope the pl now calls a penalty EVERYTIME this happens in a game because there seems like theres a different standard for man utd and another for everyone else. I literally see this happen at least once in every single game. I can’t believe chelsea’s tactic at home is to try and win a penalty. Believe you me if chelsea would have won this game they would have said chelsea were better or they would say man utd played crap. Im starting to see the pl for the pantomime it is 😂
Thanks Kepa 🤷🏾‍♂️
Fergie time
Mendy back
Would have paid 100m for 30 year old Casemiro.
Whenever I hear 'casamiro' I can't help but sing it to myself in the style of 'canyonero' from the simpsons
Sky sports gotta get rid of that commentator - ZERO passion for the game.
i feel bad for kepa , if he just got a little bit more on it at the end, he'd be the headline , really unlucky tbh
It’s actually so funny I seen a few Chelsea fans saying they thought they dominated Man Utd 😂😂😂😂😂 gotta love the delusion penalty is the only reason they scored otherwise they weren’t getting anything from that game
Dodgy penalty
please don't include score....spoils it for those who maybe don't know the score
Casemiro what a player legend
Pointless when you have ronaldo benched.  Would have won this game instead your chasing
Man it sucks that eriksen and Casemiro won’t be here for longer than 3/4 years Casemiro in particular is what we’ve been searching for years
Fans chant *Du Du Du Scott Mctominay* •Mctominay comes on •Mctominay concedes penalty
Hear people saying that EtH has brought back the belief? TEN HAG? Ronaldo scoring last minute winner v villareal? Ronaldo Last minute winner v Atlanta? Ronaldo Late winner again v Atlanta? Ronaldo Late winner v Tottenham? Don’t make me laugh with the nonsense that EtH has brought belief to this team
Post Fergy this is the best United team.  Finally on the right track but still need a few tweaks.
Yet again Kepa made it so we didn’t lose. The comeback he has made is great to see, unlucky to concede at the end there
Easy save that for a keeper that’s  mendy’s height…
Casemeiro and Martinez are absolute monsters!!!
We are lucky to get a point. United played much better.
Case(MyHero)Miro
Man Utd getting better but the attackers need to be more ruthless too many touches in that box, it’s not needed kill off teams
Rashford needs to clinical or it will cost us this season, we got the midfielders we needed, the winners we needed, 1 centre back that we needed but who'd injury will impact the team massively. Now we need that clinical striker to put the chances and shots away last 2 games we have creating so many shooting opportunities.
kepa back on form .
Martinez has transformed this team. His sheer passion, dedication to his craft, his will to win....and above all he's a hard bastard. Keano has been talking about a lack of characters in the dressing room for ages...now we've got one. He's exactly what we needed
Changed the title lmao
Poor goalkeeping
ffs really need kante james and fofana back
vs Spurs and Chelsea, both potential banana skins and yes we were a little lucky at the end today. But both times we have played well, as befits a Man Utd team. Still work to be done, but it feels like we have turned a corner.
Come on Chelsea!
Remember - Chelsea needed a penalty to score but we scored on raw skill!
Ronaldo deserve to be dropped for his behavior but with the chances we missed today, it really goes to show how Ronaldo is much needed now that this team is feeding the ball constantly at last… Rashford was incredibly wasteful and never attempts at first touch.
Dunno why Mctominay was smiling at the end... He should've begged for forgiveness from the fans, u can't do such stupid things that'll cost the game for everyone.
Casemiro is a beast! What a player 🔥
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i was screaming when the transfer was confirmed
Ronaldo should be playing In this team he’s still class
thats such a clear pen i dont know why people are complaining
Man u outclassed chelsea today
innit casemiro word class
Martinez pocketing every baller in the premier league is my guilty pleasure
Martinez again and again. World class.
Total dive. From an arsenal fan.
Lmao Chelsea tried so hard to get a penalty today 🤣🤣 falling down at every corner.
Kepa looks a top keeper wasted at Chelsea if he don’t start every week
Ever since the city loss United have really stepped up their game
I presume potter will play a couple of teams 3 x times this year without the cup runs
United Should of had the 3 points today but would of took a draw before hand
Ronaldo would of finished every chance Utd had
I watched this game with my brother, I’m a Chelsea fan, he’s a United fan, I told him at the start of the game the first goal will be a penalty from Chelsea and United will shortly draw. All this happening after the 80th minute. I would say I’m a genius but I think everyone predicted the same thing I did
United need to look towards the youth academy, the talent there will be immense, why spend millions on players in their 30's?
Mendy is saving that header all day long
No Ronaldo no win.. Suck on it ten hag!!
How is Bruno Fernandez not sent off every game he gets in the referees face more than any player he's a real wee yap crying about the penalty ffs open your eyes how blatant does it have to be before a man utd player accepts it's a penalty
Casemiro celebrated like it was the World Cup final . 😂😂🤣 I guarantee United are gonna lose their next game
Loving United recently, but McTominay... He needs to be taught discipline or sold. He's not that good to be fouling so much.
Did anyone else watch the game and see the tackle from Jorginho ?
Can we please highlight the fact that Martin Tyler is a horribly boring commentator.
Varane in tears going off was heartbreaking. Hope he's ok for the World Cup, but by his reaction, I don't think he will be. Devastated for him. He's only 29 though, it won't be his last I'm sure.
Despite Kepa getting a touch to it and almost keeping it out, that was an impressive header from Casemiro. Off balance and pulled that off
Chelsea are gonna make top 4 I reckon, I love it how everyone else keeps underestimating us
This is why casemiro has 5 champions league titles. Just a born winner
Let’s be real that 1 or 2 cm that got the ball over was pure luck  had kepa been a split second fast it would’ve been 1-0 chelsea. But oh well we move…
May man united rot in conference for the next 10 years
Amazing goalkeeping from Kepa as usual.
This is what we would like to see,Utd dominated the whole game from start to finish never a pen 🤦‍♂️ ffs
I'm a man u fan idc we scored varanes injury made me cry 😢 💔
Ronaldo scores these chances or at lease hits the target no doubt
People are commending united so much. They were one goalkeeping error away from losing
lucky lucky united again - over 2 billion spent in the last 8 years tho - work in progress !!!!!!
As an arsenal fan casemiro is world class wish we had him 😅😭
United are a joke of a club we were robbed of this game like spurs in august united always get lucky with refs and extra time. They haven’t won a trophy in 5 years 😂😂 history Fc
Manchester United just need to sign Benzema now
How can you skip casemiros cele 🤦‍♂️
ppl are talking about casemiro's header but that cross from shaw was fantastic
Tell me just how many times chelsea v utd have drawn? ( way too much)
How can u call urself a top midfielder n still holding an opponent in ur P. Box, like really, cmon bro
Since we've had Martinez and marguire has not been playing.. there has been a sharpness at the back I don't feel as anxious watching my team defend! January get rid of marguire please! 🤲🏾 Varane I'm worried
Kepa 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Result, not doing too bad to say we've probably got one of the worst squads I've ever seen, still, we stick by the reds! England's greatest club.
How on earth did man U get casemiro
We need to see a Ronaldo come back soon
100% need a new striker come January
Why did kepa not save it with his arm that was nearest to the ball. Poor last bit of keeping
Casemiro throwing him self to the ground because mount touched him with a hand is quite embarrasing. But fair play for scoring a good header almost a quality save from kepa at the end
Can’t believe we didn’t win this. Chelsea at their ground and we still dominated them
I’m telling the truth Chelsea dominated 2nd half,,,the Casemiro goal was unfortunate for the blues
I'm a Chelsea fan and think 1-1 was a fair result. Man u were definitely more threatening throughout the game, didnt seem like Chelsea were particularly threatening at all.
what an L game
As a game utd we’re lost in 2nd half 🎉
Mctominay proving why he's a liability yet again
Big respect to kepa my keeper ❤️
Lisandro with a solid performance today
The last thing we all need is Man U getting their egos back and the refs bowing down to them
Man U are Cs so arrogant 🙄
Didn’t even watch the game I was in hospital but gg coyb
Rashford earning what he does to miss every chance he gets is baffling to me
Arsenal are the best team in the world
😎
United are back  late come backs Martinez man of match!
6-3
Please stop playing mctominay he is garbage I love ten hag and I really believe he's the man to make us champions again but if he keeps bringing on players like mctominay we will stumble again and again
Like when is Manchester united going to play the 2 games they have missed out on
Miss Ronaldo - would have scored that rashford chance & other chances
United fans over the moon with a draw, oh the fall from grace.
That Martinez is really good
What's the difference in tucil and Potter no goals from chelsea pass pass no end product maybe top 6
Chelsea should give more min for Broja , give him more chances to play.!
Bruh why can't Martial stay fit. And he says he wants to be first choice striker, bro can't even play games.
Can they enlarge the posts for Rashford and Anthony ? ffsake
Happy with a point at the bridge …
I'm sorry but the goal was lucky, lucky rebound, barley over the line and potentially shouldn't have happened because of some incident with Martinez and Jorginho
Utd need to shoot from the outside more often
Ronaldo should start. Ten haag having a similar problem he did at ajax with man management
Kepa is a fraud
Prime example of why mctominay needs to be let go shocking and just sheer stupidity to give away the pen. Also think Sancho and Rashford were having their own personal battle to see who could play worse. On the other hand Casemiro and Martinez fantastic yet again and Luke shaw looking back to his best.
Have I heard VIVA RONALDO?
Chelsea and Manchester United will battle it out for 4th. Both teams lack goals. Boring game of football a point was fair for both clubs.
Did Chelsea even attack 😢?
McTominay is the new maguire. He was playing against us.
Put Ronaldo instead of Rashford and you got all 3 points ! This guy missed to many shoots !  Well done Casimiro ❤
Funny how the foul that conceded the penalty happened already in this game about 3 times
Still can’t believe we’ve got Casemiro
chelsea didnt even deserve a point from this game  disgusting never thought i'd be angry at securing a last minute point
Chelsea were mauled tbf.
United were the better team in this game tbh
It was the ice on the runway made the aeroplane go down
Congratulations to Chelsea for getting a point out of a very tricky home fixture
You can take the man out of Madrid, but you can't take the Madrid out of the man
United deserved that, better in every aspect and the fans absolutely silenced Chelsea’s fans
Why do players hold on to other players knowing its a foul. If I was the manager you wouldn't b playing next game
Any news on Varanes injury?
Antony is such an intelligent player
So many soft pens 😂
Rashford should have had 5+ goals in the past week but converted 0.
You could feel energy from both sides . Not sure why all of a sudden . Love to see it❤
first
Proves that were shambles without recce james and an actual number 9 instead of this guy who misses every chance he gets
Can Sky Sports stop putting the logo and links up so early in a celebration!?
So at 1 46 that pushing and shoving was no pen but the mctominay one is? The consistency is appallingly non existent
Where is vardy to kick the flag
I swear whenever Man U play the opposition goalkeeper always has their best game the season. Been happening for years. Not clinical enough but it's still "promising". How long will I hear that word
United let this one slip dominated first half
Devastated Ada a Chelsea fan we played well but couldn’t just finish the changes. All real respect to the boys who played very hard
Chelsea need to sharpen up or there getting destroyed by arsenal
sancho was so smelly
God how many chances did United have to get lmao
United should have put this game to bed, but at least this just shows how good Casemiro is, controlling the pace and making crucial moments.
Fair result in the end. That pen was soft.
Sensational scoreline for the league 😌
Rashfords such a bottle job!!
Casemiro get in
They would have won with Ronaldo!
That's more like the old united going to the final whistle
Who’s that celebrating a draw now
Why Rashford has to keep playing while he keep missing 2/3 easy goals every single game
Antony needs to work on his shooting to not even get that shot on target ffs
Never a penalty
Could have been a win for us…such an unnecessary foul by MT..so needless.
One of the greatest midfielder in the world
Another example of united not finishing their domination.
Man Utd scouts are rubbish. This club need younger version of Ronaldo (Leao, Isak, David) without the proper ST there is not much we can do this and any other seasons.
Why is rashford starting before Cr7?
Boring boring United oh yeh ronaldos fault ! wasn't this reason u all wanted Jose gone at least his players scored ten hag out
Another game which shows we need to get rid of Rashford as a striker! He’s not clinical in the slightest.
where is the scoreboard SKY come on BT SPORTS have better highlights
McTom is still a headache to MU. The penalty is not necessary.
I’d take Casemiro any day , some player yoy United fans have got , from a Liverpool tan
How class is casemiro? Defending midfielder at its finest!
Everyone saying about Casemiro but how good has kepa been
Manchester United have improved significantly this season, to go 1 down in the last minutes of gametime and not give up but push to get something is admirable.
Ronaldo would have scored 2 of the chances United missed in the first half - if you disagree, you're deluded.
London cowboy are looking good 😅
Martinez sitting down haters like Carragher again
Sky, your rainbow is what Revelation means when it says the beast would have an image that would come to life and compel people to bow down to it. The beast is "scarlet coloured", a system "that was, is not and yet is", (short of saying its logo would be a yellow hammer and sickle, that's as accurate such prophetic symbolism could be) and its image is the umbrella term for everything comprising its range of sacred cows that everyone must agree with, or else face being cancelled or otherwise persecuted, i.e., the image of the beast is the whole suite of wokery and the other narrative-backed sacred cows, such as the climate cult. So with your flag-waving and knee-bending, you are taking a side in a moral dispute; the wrong side, as the near future will reveal, to the astonishment and utter horror of many if not most alive today.
rules are rules but that was one soft penalty decision
Let’s all not forget how bad that Anthony looked lol that’s bad 🤣
We need a striker. The amount of chances Rashford misses is insane.
Lisandro Martinez is worth 100 million never mind 55
In Ten Hag we trust 💪💪💪
Can we appreciate the officials who had a perfect game - for once!
Chelsea offered nothing. Utd getting better.
Utd scrapping as usual
Ronaldo needs to play in my opinion rashford isn’t good enough just look at Ronaldo last season don’t understand why he’s being pushed out
Rashford has the worst touch I’ve seen a footballer have
Mctominay again😰
Not being deluded here but how on earth is that a pen i fet hes got a hold of him but does he really have to go down that hard?
Chelsea player dived should have been booked
Potter out
What I love about casemiro he always looks forward to find a pass and move the ball quick he never passes back always forward to the strikers top CDM
I keep reading how great Kepa is, just to remind everyone, this is the same guy who refused to go off the pitch when being subbed, therefore ignoring his manager, and in fairness, should never have played for Chelsea again
Feel gutted we didn’t win today but a draw was definitely a more fair result 🤝
Could tell how tired both teams were  most of the game. Was a hard point to get. To loose Varane so early on too doesn't look good with how solid the defence has been with him at the back.
To think McTomminay was keeping Casimero out of the team for so many games. Smh.
A draw was the least United deserved. Injury to Varane could be key to their top 4 chances. No like for like replacement.
Man I hate United 😂 imagine if Chelsea had a player like Anthony. We look toothless upfront.
Man u played better
Casemiro is world class
A Point at Stamford Bridge even in the SAF era was a result.
CaseHero
Wasn't a equaliser
Classemiro
The improvements under ETH are pretty astonishing. United just need an out and out goalscorer. With one, they could have put 6 past Spurs and could have been beyond Chelsea's reach at half time in this one.
Never a pen
there was no point bring on mac tommany
Sky cant even provide a good quality replay of the header. What even if the point of these highlights?
Daddy Pickford
limbs
Rashford needs to be dropped he won’t get us 30+ goals this season
Mctominay cost us this game and this ultimately comes down to the manager putting faith in the same garbage players Ole did when he was here. It's a matter of time before he gets thrown under the bus. When Ronaldo leaves which he will, all the fingers will be pointing at ETH, when results are not being achieved. History doesn't repeat itself but it does Rhyme.
Never seen Casemiro celebrate so much, he must have been bored in Spain league
It always been 1-1 since last season
Football is the best football football
I swear the refs have it in for united these last few seasons everything goes against them that was a soft penalty
3 things that are certain in life: - Death - Taxes - United and Chelsea drawing in a league fixture
Absolutely fuming over my fpl when I saw the 1-1 notification
Manutd s front row is joke,but eth loves them and bench worlds top stiker.pls gv half the chance or game time  you give  trashford to cr7.manutd  is like tory party,drain the swamp,bruno,mctominay,fred,rashford,elanga,maguire
Soon as you press play you hear the name of the best CDM in the world Casamiro!!!
Lisandro Martinez is the best CB in the premier league bar none. That's not an exaggeration. He wins everything. He never loses a dual. Absolutely world class.
Manchester United celebrating at the end like they’ve won a major trophy....it’s just another point the wrong direction
Mctominay is constantly making that foul. Mostly he gets away with it but tonight it cost us.
Casemiro’s scream at the end just shows you the elite mentality you get coming from a club winning everything
Oh ive heard it all now. 1 goal from a new signing and the utd fans heada have fell off - best in the world, best of all time, look at that roar that passion - 🤣🤣🤣🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️. Just scored a last minute equaliser. Of course hes gunna be happy. Absolute beauts
Well done Broja 🔥
shaw is looking better? just from highlights anyways, someone lmk
If mendy is in goal casemiro aint scoring dat
Why is everyone acting like casemiro is their god
Casemiro one signing has been the difference for united. Soild CDM!
Kepa career comeback is top tier.
Kepa so unlucky there, nearly pulled off a worldie.
Rashford is worst finisher in Prem! UTD fans deluded if they think he's a striker! Missed at least 10 decent 60-40 chances in past 3 matches! Street let's don't need 2nd touches in box! 🤣🤣🤣
I got to admit it now, UTD look like they are on the way back, this is only a few months into there major rebuild that was supposed to take years and ETH as already transformed them.
Casemiro, Martinez and Varane, wow what amazing signings!
rashford out
wasted our time with a 2 min celebration could have maybe got another but tbh should have won the game in the first 10-20 mins
Casemeros a great player you have to admit it even if you hate United
MU the better team in this encounter I think.   Surrounded the ref again though after just being charged.  Deserved at minimum a point.
we need a striker so baaaad, rashford does his best but upfront is not enough
If kepa saves that it would’ve been incredible. Honesty is so nice to see kepa w confidence again, Potter must really back him
amazing that both rubbish teams dropped points
both teams were shocking icl
Never a penalty another very poor refereeing decision
McTominay doing McTominay things
How many fake football fans are saying it wasn't a peno 🤣🤣🤣
What a boring game snooze fest 💤
Kepa is the worst keeper in the Prem yet plays for Chelsea
Theft.
As an Attack Helicopter, United deserved to win
Manu come on
Where the hell is Ronaldo man, United need a finisher!
Casemiro was immense but Lisandro is actually incredible. Whether he’s up against the striker, defending the box or 1v1 he wins every duel. Absolutely love him
Pls break the bank for a Verrati type midfielder. Erikson, casemiro plus 1. Stop playing mcfred.
Did Chelsea perform badly overall (I didn't watch the game)
Casemiro with the Real Madrid mentality 🔥
Think we would lost if maguire was in the team today for sure .
United fans escape a lose but talking like they won the World Cup 😂
United look great
💯💯💯💯
I don’t understand how shaw and fred keep playing games for united. They deserve to sit with maguire back at home.
If we actually had a striker that could finish one chance we would have actually won this game rashford is shocking
mctominay is a joke and shouldn't be anywhere near a united shirt
I feel every Chelsea-Manchester United game has been a boring draw since the Jose-Conte days.
man utd play better without selfish ronaldo!!!
Yooooo
It's.a.shame Man U don't have a clinical striker in the squad, they may have been able to win this one if they did...
Terrible game but Chelsea deserved absolutely nothing from it, United should have had all 3 points
This is what he does!
Never a penalty. See this every week and not given.
How can we spend over 100. Million and still have mctominay and Fred on at same time. This best be the last season we every see them playing together or either of them ever starting
Shaws on fire
If Ronaldo started it would’ve been over in 45 mins . That antony and rashford chance would’ve been buried . Ten hag learned a lesson today
easy pen. no argument at all.
CLASSemiro or CasemHERO. Take your pick, no wrong answers.
Game was so dead
Silly penalty🤔..fair point...
The management from the managers from both teams was shocking. Wow!
Since when do these type of pens get given tho
What a header from Casemiro,this fella is CLASS!
Worth every penny what a header from casemiro. My drink went everywhere!!!!!
How do you fall forwards if you’re being pulled backwards?
Casemiro goal was indeed justice.   Get in there
United 🔋🩸
Only if Utd had striker ???
Hate both these opps glad it’s a draw
Ronaldo would have won it for ya 😂
Kepa is awful icl he should be saving that
Casemiro shut all those scum annoying chelsea fans up  Best cdm in the world  There better not be a single bad word about him from now on
Thats what RM players can do Brainless Ten hag should know this truth😂
Great result that for us beat spurs that’s us 4th wkdddddddddddddd
Got to love Casemiro. Scintillating player.
Frightening the levels between mctom and caseimero
kepa cruelly close to saving that
I was at the game, incredible atmosphere at the bridge
Ty Man Utd u helped us out a lot
Never over the line, games gone
Thank God Ronaldo did not play. United would have won it with him. Thank you Ten Hag too.
2 horrible scumbag negative teams , both played for a draw 😂
United where all over chelsea untill sancho went off and bruno went out on the left i mean mcmayo was up front at 1 point
Please can we stop talkin about ronaldo. Just leave him out as united look better without him and get a new striker in Jan
Martinez giving me Vidic vibes
Man Utd have chances to get top 4 this year.
Bong
A Chelsea player took of his shirt and his pants that was funny.
Chelsea's b team was so close to a win today ...dust ourselves off and move on.
Now we need that top draw striker to start putting these chances away we are creating  Some shocking finishing today for a game we should have easily won ..  Sancho needs the bench put Rashford out on the left and get martial in the middle of that attack taking chances ..
Porginho is still got it
Scott m need to be away from this squad
Martinez, Varane and Casemiro understand what it means to play for Manchester United
liverpool have won every trophy you can win since manchester united last won something 5 and a half years ago 😂 and all chelsea won was a champions league in an empty stadium
Just saying ronaldo would of scored most of those chances
In fairness I think United should have had all 3 points if they had taken all their chances ... Chelsea were second best in that game... United are definitely on the rise if this performance is anything to go by .. they were a goal down and never gave up something that's not usually their style in the past .. they have played well against the big boys and win majority so far by betting us Arsenal ,a game which we dominated but goals win you games , they beat spuds those useless trophyless club, they beat Liverpool etc ... my verdict  so far is ... I see a team that's working to get their rhythm and style you have to give credit where its due United are playing well ... and am an Arsenal fan  ..... Arsenal4ever even in defeat
I knew jorginhos pen would be detrimental to our place in the table. There was 0 hope, until Casemiro scores 90+4! Insane ending
The most boring draw you will see all season. Pretty flat game.
Unfortunate we didn't come away with a win after the pen but manu played quite well so it was a fair result
Fergie time equaliser yet again
Anyone else noticed 2 Brazilian cdms scored against 2 Spanish goalkeepers?
WHAT?! I can’t lie I stopped watching after the penalty 😂😂😂Wtf, ain’t over til it’s over
Rashford made so many runs in the middle that would of converted.... but no supply, absolutley blind.
so jammy
Ronaldo could have been playing only for him to throw the toys outa the pram what a primadonna who thinks the team evolve around him he probably would have made a difference to that team tonight
Casemiro is the best CDM in the world. FACT!!!
Man utd old pensioners home won't get top4 this season and casmerio and others are just aging
What this highlight doesn’t show that is the Man U players surrounding the referee for 3/4 minutes after the penalty decision was made. They are classless rats especially Fernandes who is a disgrace to the game how he heckles the ref and time wastes
This was amazing to see last minute goal
Chelsea steal a result from Man UTD yet again
You know you are Certified ELITE when you can ball out in 2 leagues, Casemiro and Haaland proving theyre world class, Sancho didn't get the memo looking like he fooled everyone with the bundesliga tax again
broja actually punches mctominay look at the replay and a pen is given the other way
Wishing the best for Varane. Hopefully not as bad as he thought going off ✌🙌
We still in 4th
The best bit was Roy Keane and Gary Neville arguing over Ronaldo after the match 😂
Boring game.
And people actually said he was coming just for the money 😂😂
Should have been 3/4 united
Cody Gapko where are you?
Seriously alot of first team Brazilians on show in this game they will win the World Cup
A title of "last gasp" relating to Chelsea conceding really isn't something we havent seen before. Why do Chelsea ALWAYS throw away games in the last second? Every single match? I don't care who played better. Chelsea can't get enough of conceding goals in the last second, and then everyone goes " oohh noo 😢 what a shame 😞. " em sorry? It's fairly obvious and unsurprising guys they do it every game.
Chalobah has a very solid performance today. motm for me  Edit: he got man of the match
United had enough chances to kill the game off in the first half. If only they had a finisher who's been banging in goals all his career? 🤔
Nobody misses Penaldo 🤣🤣
New wingers and better depth are needed Sancho needed to be dropped today but had no one to replace him. Also Rashford can never be a number 9 too weak on the ball and cant lay off and his one touch football sucks the subs were ass but we have no one in this squad Antony is tired Sancho is tired and Varane is injured reinforcements are needed this summer if we want to challenge for anything next season
Cassamiro saved certain Scott’s life. He defended attacked and than scored the leveller. Just amazing and glad we have someone like him in our team 🎉🎉🔥🔥
Chelsea got lucky. United need a real striker.
Ten Hag is so disrespectful towards Ronaldo, brings on McTominay who nearly loses us the game and then Casemiro, Ronnys best mate saves the day...
We take the draw man utd against the top 5. 3 wins 1 draw 1 defeat that's decent
2pts dropped by man utd  Chelsea are absolutely awful. By far the worst of the big 6 teams  Final pass and finishing let utd down. How Anthony missed right on HT I don't know  Degea an absolute bystander again   Another game wondering how on earth Sterling gets paid to be a football. Absolutely horrendous  The only thing he does well is be awful.  Only player in world football who needs 12 touches to control a ball
Hearts v Celtic was way better
Casemiro oozes class. Unlike McFred who ooze puss. Fred on his own however is makeable.
Casemiroid
If Ronaldo played, Man Utd would have lost 4-0
Insane
United deserved at least a point
And these two teams wanna be at Liverpool's and man city's level over the past 5 years..KEEP DREAMING!!!
Kepa is proving the pple wrong, what a Great goalie
Good day for United fans. Last second equaliser and a quick tube journey home.
If they had a competition of who can hit the opposition goalkeeper with the ball Rashford would win it every year .
CASEMIROOOOOO!! We take the point at the bridge and move.
Obviously disappointing to concede a last minute equaliser but what a header by Casemiro. The second half there wasn't much in it but first half united should have been at least 1 up, if not two so I will take the draw. Hope Varane is okay, wasn't sure what he did but with the world cup around the corner and more games coming up for united it would be a real shame if it is a long term injury
Never thought I’d say this, but we desperately miss Anthony Martial
I couldn't be a ref in the Prem, the urge to headbutt Bruno Fernandez every time he got in my face would be too strong.
Again united was all over Chelsea should of been more goals
Without Striker draw😱This is United
Just wish Rashford would be more clinical in front of goal
Sky are proper naughty with that end advert.
Rashford literally can't score a goal with nobody on the pitch, the difference between the likes of Haaland and Rashford is laughable British privilege keeps putting it under the carpet.
United wear wayyy the better team today I enjoy watching them play again something good is happening with this team
Man Utd look like a completely different team this season! the turning point seemed to be dropping Maguire 🤣
Never a penalty
CR7 would have scored a brace
This Man United team, have improved so much since the start of this season. They are now winning if not drawing every game. They should have got the three points today.
"This is why we love the premier league, LATE DRAMA"
Utd celebrated like they won the league! They drew! They are 5th! With 0 goal difference!
That’s why he’s the goat the goat😂😂
Chelsea love parking the bus even at home, no matter what manager they have, it's in their DNA
I don't know why Mctominay left his job of warming the bench and had to come on and play against us. I don't even rate him.
Very soft penalty decision
Casemiro, Fergie would've been proud!
The need for a proper number 9 with United is so evident. Rashford just isn't good enough. Misses 2-3 one-on-ones per game.   If Ten Hag gets another CB (Varane injured too often) ST and a good CM he can really challenge - but it might not happen this season.
what a goal casemiro
Never a penalty. The player threw himself to the ground there.
Only issue at the minute is that united aren't clinical enough, gonna miss varane if that's a serious injury!!
United need a talented striker. Rashford just shooting straight at Kepa instead of trying to go around shows he is not top level.
the reece james difference
Ngl but Ronaldo does have something with him when he left real Madrid. They became bad in 2019 and same with juve 2021 and 2022 I think he is very special
2:10 Do some players forget there are TV cameras in the stadium??
Ffs when united conceded that pen I stopped watching cause it thought it was over
And this is why we needed a CDM for so long. World class Casemiro
Anyone saying that isn't a penalty needs to give their head a wobble
That was a good performance from United that got ruined by Mctominay being his usual clumsy self, completely lost us the 3 points we deserved.
Keeper was poor for Man U goal tbh.
Remember Casemiro had to prove his ability to Premier League pundits!👀👀
Very lucky point for Utd
Should have brought Ronaldo on....🤣🤣
Sancho was atrocious today but nobody will say anything about it 😂 🤦🏾‍♂️
Hopefully varanes injury aint too bad. He deserves to go world cup
tbh United deserved more, Chelsea were just rubbish today, neither team deserved a draw.
Lisandro yet again solid performance, we do not deserve casemiro, what a player. The passion when he celebrated made me have goosebumps
Chelsea lucky United r only jus getting there so many chances few adjustments with players this team will win things the creative play is mad
Man I hope we get a striker in January. Rashford isn’t a good finisher, just smashed the ball and hopes it’s too fast for the keeper. Rashford is so much better off the left, a striker upfront and Rashford will excel more.
Trashford is a winger, not a striker
Soft penalty but we move
Ronaldo did incredible this game
Fergie time is the best time :) cmooon Utd!!!
JUSTICE FOR UNITED!
never say die united MUFC
Get in they Casemiro on his first United goal I was almost worried we were going to lose. Thankfully Chelsea had craper in goal . Mendy clear
We on for another one of those seasons where every top team plays like garbage and does their best to throw the league except Arsenal and then by the end of the season Arsenal still don't win the title.
Martinez is a terrier. The lad backs down to no one and that energy has had a huge affect on the team. Fair play to him, the catalyst to the upturn in spirit
martinez, casemiro, varane are the three players which have brought back pure passion matched with class to Manchester United. we have needed this for so many years, its so good to see the passion
Man utd team needs a finisher. Varane onto,  now going to be stuck with Lindelof.
We lack of creativity cost us the game
If only we could score been playing well lately
The thumbnail 😭
United need a killer up top and their cooking
Dr gea and penalties.
Ronaldo been on the bench for majority of the season so far, he’s been left out of the squad yet I still don’t see a high scoring Man U team, Ronaldo or not there’s genuinely a end product issue happening
Thiago Silva dives the corner before Borja goes down like a sack of potatoes to get a dodgy penalty just for them to draw anyway, feels good 😂
I want Mctoenail out of my football club
United. The come back king
I like how Rashford complains about not getting the ball in the first highlight but then shows his Lukaku touch in the a few highlights later
Martinez and Casemiro just 🤩
A fair result on balance,both teams deserved something.
Nah bro when you see the title and thought it said "Cristiano" 😭
Playing better without Ronaldo
Chelsea alway bottles it in end first Tottenham now Man United.
Thank god Casemiro scored. I thought we were doomed when they got a penalty
What a way to get your first goal for Man Utd!!!!!!!
Stupid From Mctominay , Clear pen, Draw Fair result though
3 big chances, utd need a finisher. But you can see how they're improving, 1st half was really good
The upgrade from McFred to Casemiro is on another level
Rashford starting in games is just mind boggling. Incapable of finishing AT ALL but the English Media will always say otherwise 🤦🏾‍♂️
Man Utd have had the hardest schedule so far than any Premier league side and have already faced every big 6 club and are only a point away from top 4. Huge change by Ten Hag.
I can't believe there are people arguing that's not a penalty! 100% pen every day of the week.
Mctominay is like playing with a man down he is so bad
TH should change Fred or McTominay for Ronaldo, unbelievable...
That thumbnail is ✨
I’m Arsenal,Kovačić should start today
McTominay has always been making such silly fouls and getting away with it. He was always due a time of reckoning
Come on.  💙
What a time to score your first goal for Man United had a tough start to the season but hopefully this could be his turning point.
man u a poor club
LOVE THE TITLE
Shame we drew but seeing kovacic naked made my day fr
United were the better team overall and the stats show. Chelsea miss Reece James (and Kante) and have been cursed with strikers ever since Diego Costa left
Ten Hag has really turned Man United around . Kudos to him
Gloriglori man uitid
Gary Neville banging his head on the table at 2:27 🤣🤣
As an Arsenal fan I became a united fan for the final few minutes😅
the fact that Man United bought Varane Casemiro and Ronaldo just to make De Gea feel like he's at Real Madrid is just genius
Match of the week
Mendy would’ve saved that 🫣
Martinez very consistent
United deserved the win but we lacked finishing again like we did against Newcastle,  overall a draw a fair result , Chelsea lacked any real threat
Utd should've scored in the first half the way they were creating
skys usin emojis now yhhh😂
Rashford just isn’t clinical enough, he is not a proper number 9.
You only see diving like what Chelsea did in the Olympics. The draw was justice. Absolute justice.
WE ARE MAN UNITED AND WE'RE NEVER GONNA STOP OLE OLE OLE!!!
It's incredible how many chances Rashford needs before he hits the back of the net. He's never been a top level striker. He'll go the same way as Welbeck.
Man Utd were robbed, dominated from start to finish. Casemiro showing his class.
If United get a good striker they will be a dangerous team to play against
The linesmen In this game must of been Stevie Wonder 😂
WE NEED PETER DURY NOW MARTIN TAYLOR AINT FUN ANYMORE
We gonna talk about kovacic or what….
I understand ''we got a draw at the bridge'' will be united's biggest achievement under ten hag. But why is Casemiro celebrating like that?
casemiro...wow. i thought chelsea would win because i looked at the score in stoppage but i checked later and i was like :000000000000
Some nerve for the title
CASEMIRO’S OUR SAVIOUR ONANA NA NA NA NA NA
Never ever a penalty
We love Casemiro
Casemiro can get recognition for many things…  But Sky Sports really liked that header 😅  Edit: They changed the title
Sky Sports Admin is a united fan😂
That thumbnail is amazing
They are lucky Man United. Stupid Mctominay!!!!!!😠😠😠😠  I'm a Man United fan aswell.
Normally scheduled a 90-minute nap during United games, but ETH has other plans!
You can tell this man United team is starting to play to the death now, not just giving up when going behind, so good to see but we should have had all 3 points today
Chelsea didn't deserve the point but that's on us for not taking our chances. Good game though
utd against top 6: 3 wins 1 loss 1 draw
I’m a Liverpool fan but this is fun game got me interested of the 2008 UCL finals
I remembered a few weeks ago some people here said McTominay was far better than Casemiro. Where are you guys?   We dominated the first half, the second half was balanced.   We must solve our striker issues by bringing in one or two quality signings in January. Ronaldo will be gone, and Martial facing difficulty with injuries.
Man U need a young fresh striker in January, need to make the most of all these chances
CMON CASEMIRO!!!
Utd were robbed again by a weak decision when hammering a team,Clear bias every game but what a player and what a header from Casemiro,Martinez is the best Cb in the league,Man Utd need a striker asap who’s quick and sharp,Really missed Martial today.
So you’re telling me UTD aren’t gonna play trash all season? As an arsenal fan this is worrying I’ll be honest
Listen, Man United might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. TEN HAG'S (Ole 4.0) at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing. MAN UNITED ARE BACK!!!
If United had a Ruthless striker they would have walked it today. Great to see Luke Shaw return to form. Definitely not a penalty.
Ronaldo would have at least scored one goal if not two.
CASEMIRO!!! ❤
What a player cass is
We are really missing Reece James and it shows
I think someone told Mctominay that he had to act upon the Rainbow Laces movement cos what on earth is he doing touching up Broja like that man?
Completely robbed, great performance from united, dominated the London cowboys
idk what's happening to the refs this season, they seem to get worse every year
Lisandro Martinez deserves praise and respect, the guy is genuinely unreal
My girl just cheated on me
Casemiroooo clutch
Never a pen mark goldbridge
Bring back Ronaldo!!
We played OK but need to keep ball more could of score 2or3
INJUSTICE TO THE GOAT CR7
He’s a millionaire, won everything, done everything in the game, and still roars with that kind of passion at the death of a game. Football at its best.
Man Utd should have scored at least 2 In the first half
ez for united
siuuu
Feels illegal to be early
Deserved from United. Should’ve won actually
get tuhcel back in potter is horrible coming fromma chelsea fan what the hell is this performance horrible no way we are getting top fpur
it's time for yellow cards for every player who surrounds the ref after the refs decision, disgraceful from fernandes who admitted after the game he didn't even see it at the time.
Need a striker in January.
I’d say a 1-1 was expected
1st
1st
Man U lucky for the draw
wow first comment
first
Casemiro is incredible
What a great game both teams showed incredible character
Never seen a title like that from sky before 😂
We all know Man Utd won this game
What a game like shaw was brilliant wonder if hes making the England squad now
This is what u call JUSTICE
Come on united
First
we should have won ffs
Chelsea lucky for a draw
