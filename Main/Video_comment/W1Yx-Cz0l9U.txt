Rest in pieces
You guys guys could’ve had it all
I want play online 😢
The biggest blunder in gaming history.
RIP it officially closed today. One of the biggest video game fumbles of all time..
I hope a Story Mode Ideas for MultiVersus in 2026
And now the game is being shut down May 30th lol
Failures
👎🏿
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Now is Shutting down again it was one of my favorit games
Tony the biggest worst director of all time
Sad this game only had a one year lifespan. What a waste of potential. Not that it was perfect to begin with.
Oh really?
Here after seeing the news about season 5 honestly good riddance beyond me how a beta can be better than a full game player first games my ass
the fact we have a mapeans we should get courage the cowardly dog😢tony🙏
tony,new mechanics courage the cowardly dog
This guy should never make a video game again! You must be genghis khan's desendant bc all you do is rob people ya goof
1:35 "to provide top class online play" 🤡🤡🤡
This aged well.....
Game died again lol
lol everytime I see how broken and unpalatable this game is I come back to this video and just laugh
CONSISTENT GAME PERFORMANCE LOL YEAH OK
This video is comical two weeks into release
It needs Spinel then I have no complaints at all.
i really really want multiversus on the nintendo switch
"Consistant, world class, online play"   "Consistant game performance, no matter what platform you're playing on."  Yeah. Sure.
ok, the game is out now, you screwed it up
Sigo teniendo crashed error, ni siquiera pude entrar (pc)
¡LA PEOR NOTICIA DE TODAS!
Funny how they said the netcode is incredible when in reality it still isn't good 😂
Will the game also be available on Epic Games?
Well, it's May 28th today, and I tried to play the game, but it still had the offline mode, so I deleted the game and am waiting for it to reinstall itself, but I'm worried it will still be offline when it redownloads, so does anyone have any advice?
Let the brawl of the multiverse begin again
Add smongus
I’ve been checking every day waiting 😭
Just 1 day to wait :)))))
Please add Craig of the creek, so much potential
are you sure you aren't going to get sued by Nintendo
Add Daffy duck
Dos anyone know if u get ur stuff back
It's crazy it took you almost a year and you haven't added more characters, neither announced big names like Ben 10, Harry Potter or any other big name. Your game is gonna die again. PLEASE change Morty's grounded up attack, it is hot garbage. AND ADD GRAB AND DEFENDING, AND STOP TAKING TURTLE STEPS Aren't the characters a little to big for the maps now?
is it being released globally? cause its not on my steam :(
Im looking forward to the alludium q36 explosive space modulator
They should treat this like  it's toonami...! Bring in Inuyasha, Yusuke, Robert Smith off Big O..
Please rework the over complicated gameplay
Excited to try the new netcode, this is one of the best smash clones for sure. I might like it better than smash actually
#Ben10formultiversus
W WB IN CHAT NOWWWW❤
I hope you remove the grind for the perks. Or remove them altogether.
Sadly no mobile version 🥹
Is there Asian servers?
The most important thing this game need's is a story mode, just like Subspace Emissary in Smash Bros
May this game rise again once more
lol @ your gadgets mean nothing earth man.😁 welcome back👌.
OMG CAN'T WAIT!!!!
Everything looks awesome and i just saw this but is it just me or do the characters look to big for the stage?
I hope its available in ASIA too and they add flash soon to the game
PLZ ADD RAVEN WE WANT RAVEN
Wealth of personalities is stretch, one of the main issues with the first open beta was a limited roster take look at past cartoon network shows like Regular Show, Samurai Jack, and Powerpuff girls. Me and a lot of people still see potential in this game so far most of the characters are either DC or Loony Tunes and a few odd ball sprinkles in how are you gonna have Fin and Jake but no Mordecai and Rigby. Come on!
I'm just hoping we get Foghorn Leghorn at some point. I want to smack people around with a hench, 7 foot tall, rooster man.
I wish Multiverses added combos to make the game look better
Can't wait for the competitive multiverses scene to show up this summer
I just want Gypsy danger gumball and the flash
Thank you Tony Ive been waiting patiently to play with Rick again 🙏🏼
Will you bring back mods?
Philippines when?
All they had to do was not be soo damn greedy and this game would be so beloved
Imagine how wild flash or darkside would play in this game ... Or hell what about Marty mcfly or John Constantine or aliens and predator or pennywise.
Woooooooo
Please revert the size changes, I’ve been playing the game everyday in the lab discovering new things and the sizes were perfect
Cuando sale para nintendo switch😢
😂MV bout to be a sweat fest on launch!
I’m so exited !!🥹❤️

Who else wants Billy & Mandy as a duo in this game?
Will this game be added to Switch?
🔥🔥🔥
YES BRING IT BACK
Dead on release
Hi MultiVersus!  I really liked the game when i saw the open beta,cause it look like an Warner Bros version of Super Smash Bros,imagine that in some years,MultiVersus is the new Super Smash Bros?,i really liked to play with my sister,but even with the servers closed,i still played with my sister,on the tutorials and the test one! (Forgot the name sorry) but i have one question…. Who already installed MultiVersus will have to buy in May 28? Im from Brazil tho:)❤
Can't wait to be a menace with Harley again
I loved the game from the start. I was upset when they closed it down. But I’m so excited to play again soon.
That gave me goosebumps !!
So happy to return! But I'm begging you PFG: Paul Atreides vs Harry Potter...I need this in the game yesterday
bilbo baggins needs to be here
LETS GO MULTIVERSE IS BACK
It’s official the Powerpuff Girls are coming 1:14
Why isn’t coming out on Nintendo Switch?!!
Give Asians a server 🙏
Imo I still think it looks mediocre at best. I played the game and enjoyed it for a week and then didn’t touch it again. There is potential, but they are already off on the wrong foot.
Mordecai and Rigby when?
Put Gwimbly from Smiling Friends in the game. He needs to be in the game.  You already have Rick and Morty and other mature characters in it why not Gwimbly
We need the mask in this game
Bring this game back! I had so much fun the first time around!
Honestly, if they keep the perk system and the focus on 2v2, Multiversus will just fail again. Platform fighters just don't work with those types of mechanics.
Im about to destroy all of y'all with my Jake the dog
Let Goooooooooo Multiversus Coming This May 28 Get Ready Everyone
Ben 10? 😿
Lets go
To deliver on the promise of "Multi", the game needs systems that make 2v2 enjoyable. Nobody enjoys 2v2 in platform fighters since every errant blow causes hitstun. It's a mess.
No one cares, bad game
i didn't see in steam in 28 may.how can i dowload
No one likes this game 💀
I love games that launch incomplete and fix later
cant wait
OMG, I cannot wait for this, it's gonna be awesome, lets just hope they haven't utterly destroyed it like the Bombergrounds Team did...
Any new characters??? Or are you really launching the game wothout any new maps or new comers or roadmap?
Once they said pve I got flashbacks iykyk
my top five characters in  multiversus  my list  5: godzilla  and king Kong  4: beatlejuise  3:spike from tom and Jerry  2:lola bunny and daffy duck  1:scooby doo
PLEASE ADD SCORPION FROM MORTAL KOMBAT
am i fucking tripping cuz i swear i played this game like two years ago and still have it in my library
Add fucking lore
I know that this is stupid but I have a request...PLEAE and I mean PLEASE add BEN 10
Game looks the same lol
The game only need new server like meddle east
Hyyyype hell yeah that's what's up, the timing makes it feel like it was meant to be lol
I'm only playing this game if those leaks were true and Maxwell is gonna be in lmaooooo
Glad it's coming back!
dude I don't think I've been this hyped for a game in a WHILE
Aha yo he said iconic czerachters
May 28th 😂😂
I am so excited to play again.
Played the closed beta a long time ago, then it shut down. I thought it was gone for good... Needless to say, it was a surprise to see Multiverses news pop-up on my Steam feed.  Hope this goes well. =D
Can I play offline?
Did you guys ad online mic so we can talk to our crossplatform friends?
Yessss
It’s gonna die again
Can't wait!
WAHOOOO!!! LET'S GOO!! I MISS PLAYING BUGS BUNNY YALL BETTER MAKE THE CHARACTERS  FAIR I WANNA SEE REGULAR SHOW
Still no Heisenberg?   Also that guy looks like Rupaul
I spam backpack! Nobody can beat me!
Already loved the game, and it looks even better now! Dexter's Lab and Townsville Hall?! Super exciting!
ENFIN🎉🎉🎉🎉
PLEASE put asia servers this time
Wann kommt rumbleverse wieder zurück
😂😂 a few new maps and possibly a new character or 2. wtf were they doing for a year? massive L for Warner brothers a multi billion dollar company
"its launching on 28th of may" ... bro thats a re-release. I even have it in my steam library already.  Dont ignore the fail you produced one year prior. Red flag of death right here

One month and 0 content ? If this game dies again you can’t complain, you reap what you sow
Hyped but if you add Ben 10 I’ll definitely be spending a lot of cash on skins so you should add him 😉
so you guys did nothing basically
I played this game until my thumbs were raw❤. My boy Finn go crazy 😂
it looks a lot less floaty :o
I’m so excited to see scorpion and Daffy Duck
if only the hitboxes were normal from the beginning everyone stopped playing before it was fixed after the game was good
This community has been waiting so long for this thank god
MK1 sub zero and scorpion? 🥺👉👈  Edit: I want them fighting as brothers side by side just once😔

1:29 Pay attention to rick, he has a new move
THIS IS HOW ITS DONE. Respect
Please give us Lord of the Rings characters 😢, I also wouldn’t mind a bugs look that isn’t the old version but the newer design
List of characters they should add: • at least 1 Teen Titan • Gumball and Darwin • at least 1 character from Regular show  Edit 1: • at least 1 character from Dexters Lab • Michael Jordan
i loved the game before. top 50 WW here
the music and the little charming parts like marvin hacking the teleprompter, those parts really got me to shed a tear. Im greatly looking forward to the rerelease of this game
I wanna cry rn like im so happy its coming back i CANT WAIT!!!!
where is the game it's april 2nd
3 weeks and no trailer food ?
finally they are baaaaaaaaaack!!!cant wait to play on my ps5 everytime after school
new chaaracters charlie and the chocolate factory multiversus update
Yo Marvin is Dope I wanna his someone with that The Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator
WOOOOOO YE BABY THATS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR WOOOOOO
Watch it be April fools prank 💀💀💀
I need this for switch bruh because i want more platform fighters to play other than smash. Brawlhalla ain't cutting out for me it's just so boring and bland and i just can't find a reason to get good at it.
I just need to know if they changed the stock system. Sharing stocks sucks n only 2 a piece isn't enough. For the love of God o hope they gave us 3 separate stocks like the established standard that we've all grown used to
Thank god multiversus is back and please please dont mess this up your game has potential
Shambles for this game
YO AND ITS GONNA BE ON PS4, i am truly blessed.....also We need the smiling friends in this game
Im so glad they learned from the mistakes and are trying again  From the footage you can tell that they removed the floatiness that the previous game had, I love that  The game has massive potential now
i hope they take out finn...forever
Guys WE ARE SO BACK also make a switch version
I thought it was March 28th 😭
add godzilla and optimus prime
This is there last chance lets hope it goes well
We need kong(And Godzilla) The world needs him…(Them)
where do you download?
Will it be available on ps4
I'm actually so fricken excited. I love this game so much😭😭
IM SO FRICKEN HYYPEEED OMLLL LETS GOOO😭😭😭😭😭😭
Finally!!!! It’s back!!!!!!
Bro I thought it was March 28th💀
WHEERES THE GAME EARTH MAAN!
super smash bros boring stuff
I’m hype😆
I can’t wait I was playing on ps4 and my hit scan was weird sometimes I can’t wait 2 play this game again
Really excited that the game is not dead at all, its probably one of the best feeling 2d friendly fighters since its float gameplay makes the hits feel harder and more like a john wick movie, but i hope they take measures to keep the game alive since the battlepass model sucked last time i think it should be less battlepass and more item shop with a battlepass option that offers little or no exclusive rewards and most come to the item shop later ( i understand its a free to play game that needs to make money but all im saying is dont lock characters and offer a ton of costumes we can always buy with in game purchasable currency and they will make boat loads)the game would need to focus on a season base with planned updates or updates very constantly and transparent since the main issues with the game was not at all the gameplay or engine or characters last time it was the lack of content and force push of the battlepass which i understand but as someone who has maybe an hour to play battlepass models never really stuck with me and i feel this game should go more the nickelodeon route and lean hard into the fan service which they started with the super sayian shaggy but lean harder not force it but involve it in the development of the game anyway really excited and i cant wait for the day this game comes back online
I love how much work was put into it but i reeeeally hope the game isnt as floaty as it was in the Open Beta, it made matches very slow
bro i cant wait until may 28 i thought it was march 28
That means new characters will be added, right?
IT NOT ON SWITCH WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I dont care if they do the same mistakes they did in the beta, I JUST WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME AGAIN.
I want Rocko Wallaby, Conker the Squirrel, Henry Stickmin And Spider-Man Joins Multiversus
I really hope we get spike, scooby, scrappy, Ed edd n eddy, the Flintstones, samurai jack etc
Y’all watch out for me in May I’m gonna be the most insufferable Steven main ever
Hopefully they’ll add the Boondocks characters on here lol
Say what you want but Multiversus is the only game closest to Smash Brothers
Townsville and dexters labb???😮😮
Put Super Shock!
My 5 dollars I spent on this game won’t go to waste
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
It looks the same 💀
i miss this game so much !!!! this brings a tear to my eye
I’m hella exicted
https://youtube.com/@MultiVersusNews?si=acOFiFDxGO7p2w2O
Add ben 10 to the game
Hope it has offline multiplayer this time
I want the game for Android and IOS, that's it.
and it's gonna die quicker than the first time
Lack of progression, customization and depth, including depth of meta, will make this game go low very fast. I love the game… But I'm skeptical for long term success.
WE NEED SUNSTONE
Wow a slower version with a glow up. Not expecting anything, they just want to milk it even more
I want Jon Snow, Ben 10, Teen Titans, The Flash, Green Lantern, Chowder, Grim, Billy, & Mandy, Johnny Bravo, and Courage The Cowardly Dog added to the game as playable characters.
I just wish you cared about casual gamers too. I don't care about e sport, i wanna play with friends on Team Battle, Survival and stuff like that. Multiversus offline had 0 game modes, 0 options to customize your experience ... And even in casual play people were trying so fucking hard because everyone is ranked here. Maps were boring due to very poor level design (to make everything "balanced"). I don't care about balance, make fun maps like Smash !! Please care more about casuals !!!
Helll yeahhh
I spent $140, the game died, and I got banned from their Discord. I have zero expectations for player first
The road to punch
YESSIR
Hopefully this doesnt fail cuz i really liked multiversus and i dont want it to shutdown like other f2p games
Why would you upgrade your PC to play this ? UE5 is pretty bad optimised compared to UE4
Please change shaggy’s shit boring, uninspired moveset into something actually creative
Nobody believed me when I said ya'll would come back with a mission. Proud of this game series already
YESIRR IM SO READYYYY
Do we get the stuff we already bought
Musica novo
Please add Scooby, Daphne and Fred!!! Please complete the gang!
PLEASE
I actually quite enjoy this game.
please launch the game on android, android tv and ios
I still wanna know what happened to the people who spent money originally..when we log back in will everything still be there or what
FINALLY !!!!!!!!!!!
I am so happy you are returning and I still wish Martian Manhunter, wile e coyote and daffy duck join multiversus.
Why is it not on switch? :(
Plis add avatar aang in gama and his gang
I still prey for other competitors who will be updated. Joker  Lex luthor  Bane  Brainiac  Robin  Super girl  Cyborg  The flash  Green lantern  Aqua man  Star fire  Raven  Beast boy Lola bunny  Daffy Duck  Porky pig  Tweety & Sylvester  Gossamer  Foghorn  Yakko, Wakko & Dot Pinky & the Brain  Buster & Babs  Spike the bulldog  Scooby doo The Mask  Sméagol  Beetle juice  Godzilla  King Kong  Mothra  King Ghidorah  Mechagodzilla  Skar King  Harry Potter  Voldemort  Ben Tennyson Dexter  Grim reaper  Willy Wonka
Pls Add Omni Man from invincible
Im curious but can this game be played on low end pcs like brawlhalla can???
if Marvin's in, I'm hoping that they might give us some duck dodgers representation by adding in Daffy, giving him his Duck Dodgers and/or Green Loontern outfit, and bringing back Queen Tyrhanee as a possible echo/alt voice costume for Marvin.
We need Mordecai and Rigby in this
I want a Walter white character
ahh shitt
FINALLY! I LOVE U TONY!
UNREAL ENGINE 5! WE ARE SO BACK! FOUNDERS UNITE!
Fellas, hear me out, JUST ADD WALTER WHITE!
I'm guessing the re-launched version won't be on Switch
ive been waiting on this forever!!! Cant wait to jump back in 🎉
FREE SHAGGY !
WE NEED BREAKING BAD ON THIS GAME
Just put a price on it. The f2p model is not good for this kinda game.
Godzilla and King kong  robot zilla
That’s great they’ve fixed a lot of the combat mechanics, and graphics. But nobody really complained it to begin with. I’m pretty sure the common consensus was that the game was great, but gave us only 2 modes? That’s why everyone stopped playing? That’s really ominous they never mentioned anything about what they’ll be adding to the multiplayer experience, but hoping for the best.
okay so only 6 days after mí bday that’s not that long 😭😭
I hope they dont patch Toms bat 🫤
no sea sever = dead game
this game deserve a way better fan base than any fighting game
Why not in the Nintendo switch?
Where tf is Daffy Duck????
I'm just glad I get to annoy people while playing Finn again😂
Is it coming on switch?
Let’s go! Finally get to dog walk on people in multiversus again!
Only the OG multiverses accounts can like 👇
We got Multiversus PVE before Overwatch PVE 😭🙏
Imagine them adding Evolved Godzilla or Kong, holy shit.
LETS GO!😭
To Tony and the team, i hope you guys are still working on a game you like, not selling your souls to WB too much.
Plus for the boss fight I want tin pan and alley from the Tom and Jerry movies
"Yo bro everyone's online hop on multiversus"
Scrappy doo would be a great character for Multiversus  because the people who hate him get to fight him and beat him up and the people who actually like him like me can play as a character they like!
And pls put sonic the hedgehog and Garfield and animainiacs and ready player one and cuphead
Please add jojo
Good, now where’s Jon Snow?
Ben 10 for multiversus
Final smash  multiversus 🎉🎉🎉
So do we keep all of our in game purchases from the beta? Im assuming its all saved under our warner bros account?
😍😍😍
LETS GOOOOO MULTIVERSUS
LETS GOOOOOOO
Now I wasn't ecstatic about this game but I can respect the shit out of anybody who will take their time to redo the game so they can come back harder.
For a game like this. Ya'll were in beta for faaar too long. I thought the game had been abandoned tbh 😆
Am I the only one that thinks that graphics looked better before? The flat colours made it look more like cartoons
スマブラでいいや
No habrá contenido inclusivo? ya estamos harto que los juegos hayan inclusión forzada y arruinan las experiencias de los videojuegos.
Great news
Something tells me that they really love marvin.
Rick main here I miss this damn game I just downloaded it just to lab again can’t wait
Tony looking sexier than ever.  Cant wait for this game to relaunch
isn't it scary that everything is concept art etc while its only 2 months away?
Yeeeeeeeeey
Im maining Shaggy and   Rick Sanchez
oh god who cares if the sandwich looks fucking better, work on performance not pixels
Can’t wait to see this game be popular for 2 months and be forgotten again.
Anyone else hear the joker laugh at the beginning
I'm going to play as Marvin in this game who will you main?
So it’s mortal combat?
I got some wish list: raven, ninja, brute, T.O.M. from Toonami, beetlejuice, wicked witch and Klonoa from upcoming Klonoa movie in summer who sounds like Hal from megamind
Here are my 3 request for characters in Multiversus: Robin (every versions if possible including Teen Titans Go version) Walter White and Harry Potter!
WHY HAVE YALL STILL NOT ADDED IT ON SWITCH
Okay but do I keep my character redeem tokens and outfits etc I already have? Cause I'll be damned if I pay another 100 bucks for this shit
Do we keep our old stuff i hope we do
U guys still dont get it for the characters ... i know a lot of people who like multiversus .. but doesnt give a shit about your characters ... release some goku , godzilla , kong , something ffs ... fucking inspector gadget but holy fuck puff puff girls??? .... seriously ????
so can we get BEN 10
HUGE
❤️‍🔥🙏🏽❤️‍🔥
I used to beliiieve !
Werner Bros Are You Gonna Add Spinel From Steven Movie in MultiVersus Cuz i Wanna Unlock & Play Her When The Game Release On Switch! <.< :3
I know this game since it was a leak, and this could be amazing
Mobile
Man i miss throwing some batarangs... all the best to the studio!! take your time to finish it and we'll be ready for may launch.
I love this
Ultimate fictional fight come for bigger brawl.
Rebuilding from the ground up for a FREE TO PLAY game is crazy.  Happy to support Tony and the PFG team
Let's gooooooooooooooooooooo!!!
devs are a bunch of scammers
Give us Walter White!
finally
Before the game fell off harder then my momma belt
Me and my cousin just had a chat about this game hopefully coming back!
Ok can we get more short cut scenes
Let Tony cook 🔥🔥🔥
Can we get freakazoid?
このラインナップでスイッチキッズに売らないとかマジか
i hope its not free
I'm hoping they've added a story mode and are just keeping it a secret for a bigger surprise on launch
LETS GOOOOOO
1:20 - Beta looked infinitely better, wtf.
Dexter AND PowerPuff!!?  ALL I EVER WANTED!! ❤
This game and College football are definitely gonna take my attention from 2k this year.
Yeeessss sirrrrrrrr !
WE ARE SO BACK
Anyway, my man, ur game failed cuz you guys removed the mods...
lets gooo its freeeee
Yup, we have a pulse! MultiVersus is coming back! And we're getting new stages based on The Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory, meaning we finally have Cartoon Network representation for shows that existed prior to the 2010s! It also basically means that the PPG and Dexter will end up being a lock for the roster! But that's not all! Folks, if you haven't already, take a good look at the new banner art they put out, and you'll notice two balloons resembling the likenesses of Yakko Warner and The Brain, which means that this Warner Bros. platform fighter won't be going without the Warner Brothers (and the Warner Sister!) after all! Yakko, Wakko & Dot, my most wanted characters for this very game, are very likely to be joining the roster as well! Gosh, this makes me so happy!  Now, there's a chance it could just be only one of the Warners, but I'm hoping it's all three, as a three-in-one fighter you can swap between on the fly a la Pokémon Trainer would be the ideal way to go if you ask me. Either way, I can't be happier that MultiVersus is getting another chance. Here's hoping the online community will actually last this time!
aleluia
I cant wait to grow with this game  i earned all the trophies   Ranked up from 13 million to 500    With tom and jerry     I cant wait to go on this journey       My heart is pumping   Can you feel it   Is the #Returnofmultiverse  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😅
I like the game its not really bad. but honestly I thought it was gonna be like rumbleverse but multivers themed
IT'S ABOUT TIME LETS FUCKIN GO
This is great news come on guys let smash bros knows you're  back in and that you're here to stay. Can't  wait to play it again I miss this game
hope they fixed the braindead ability spam
Is anyone gonna ignore the fact that WB's Watertower is also featured on the set of Tony being interviewed. Along with the track "Come On Down to the Warner Bros. Lot", that's pretty much confirming that the Animaniacs will be playable. Prove me wrong.
For all the people who didn't think it'd return. Shush.
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Just got Through Practicing, can't wait until 28th!!! Taz and Garnet going to put them hands ✋️ on you!! And yes it was on hard and yes it was one, me, versus three computers!!
My dream character is Maxwell from Scribblenauts. He's already a WB Games character, his moveset is literally only limited by the imagination of the developers, and he has countless family members that look exactly like him so he's already perfect for skin customization
We better get the teen titans!
So Mario smash bros with new characters
Really hope they removed 2v2 being the priority
Lets hope this doesn't get cancelled for tax write off, you never know with Warner Bros. 😂
Are there gonna be Asia servers this time?
So, does this mean there'll be even more characters? And that statement about that space modulator, is it like a super move of some sort? Will the other characters have super moves too?
Amazing, can't wait. UE5 is sick.
Wow, from the ground up... The main thing the game needed was performance, really, although there's other cool things here too like the Dash Attack A question remains I'm sure the McDonalds deal was made largely in advance and the fact that your big partner is a boycott target is upsetting... but Harley Quinn's voice doesn't sound changed... Is anything being done there? You know... The whole pro-killing-of-countless-people situation?
I LOVE THIS GAME IS BACK but they still haven’t added on switch :(
I feel this game would be so much better if the physics and combos weren’t so janky. It’s why I dropped the game in the first place
I miss this game so much
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG 😭😭😭😭
So it's STILL not available in Southeast Asia?
Yo WE' BACK!
Vai ter Boruto?
UNBAN ME TONY UNBAN ME I HAVE NOT FORGIVEN YOUR SINS I SPENT MY MONEY ON CLASSIC HARLEY AND AM BANNED!!!!
i was a top 200 solo shaggy in the world so i'm really excited for it to come back
I want word girl
This better be an improved version of Multiversus. I tried to play this for recordings last year, and the servers were an abomination!
Woohoo 🎉🥳🥳🎉
I'll give it another shot I guess, but I wasn't super impressed the first time
Ready for micro transactions? Need to make up the suicide squad flop
"Open Beta" No it was the FULL LAUNCH, stop trying to hide away and say it was a "test". The game started doing sh!t because content wasnt coming out on time and not much content, with bs priced microtransactions.  With this Relaunch of the game, there definetly better be WAY more maps, skins, modes, and characters (ESPECIALY GOD DAMN BEN 10) not just 4 of each, ACTUAL ways to earn a lot more currency for free and rewards to be way cheaper and NOT OVERPRICED LIKE A STUPID F&%KEN BANNER OR STICKER
WB you suck live service SCAM
Please add Daphne Blake, Godzilla and The Flash
I'm so glad to see you guys back 😭😭
Can't wait to beat Steven Universe once again. You truly put Players First!
YES WE GETTING MULTIVERSUS BACK
I PLAYED THE BETA CANT WAIT
Will it have campain/story mode in it? And when will Harry Potter come to this?
I hope Blake, Ruby, Yang and Weiss from rwby be the new fighters in multiversus..
Hope they release multiversus on switch
This is one of the few free to play games where you really don't need to buy anything to acquire a character. Warner Bros should continue making triple AAA games, without a battle pass and without having to buy loot boxes. The only thing acceptable in paid games are DLCs. Warner is stupid thinking that triple A games are not worth making when the only game in this style that flopped was Suicide Squad because it was a game with a very poorly executed story, full of flaws in the script, disrespecting all the male characters and the entire Arkham legacy . On top of all this, it changed the ethnicity of characters that were already presented as white, diminished all the achievements of Flash, Batman and any male character - all of this being the fault of Sweet Baby Inc. Meanwhile, she forgot about all WB's successes, such as the entire Batman Arkham saga, Injustice, and Hogwarts Legacy, which was the best-selling game of 2023.
Gumball And Darwin 🙏🏻🥺
I'm kinda confused cause I thought this game was already fully out for at least a year. Pretty sure it did not say beta and it had trophies on playstation etc.
We are so back ! <3
Coming May 28th
The Powerpuff Girls
bro I was rank 24k as shaggy thank u so much for bringing this back bro
Dexter- LET THERE BE FIRE FOR ALL
They gotta add regular show
Ngl looks like theyve cooked. Ill definitely give it a try again
Yes!!!!!
Ben 10
Can't wait!  I love platform fighters and Black Adam is easily one of my favorite characters I've ever played in one. So hyped and hopefully we'll get some Lord of the Rings reps soon!
My biggest problem in beta was slow AF exp gain.  Wish he woulda mentioned more about player concerns from the beta period.
Bugs Bunny sounded flamboyantly gay in that last moment.
Hoping everything goes well for release. I'm looking forward to new stage music that hypes the players. A new character i would like to see is Freakazoid.
Extremely excited too see this come back this game is amazing if you are a competitive gamer.
UE5? Noooooooooo! The jump to a new engine is bad for older hardware! Don't do that!
The Powerpuff Girls may be joining the brawl? Make Courage the Cowardly Dog playable and I'm solid!
But can we mod the game? That's the appeal of most Unreal games.
So, can we get the Asia server?
Ye
Let's gooooooooooooooo
Excited to play this game again.
LETSGOOOOO
pls add SEA server
Nothing about unlocking characters?
COURAGE PLSSSSSSSSS <3
Il definitely be getting that back
Oh samurai jack and johnny bravo
Add BEN10, BEAST BOY, GENERATOR REX, THE SATURDAYS, Scooby Doo, knd and rowdy ruff boys
I hope you don't have to buy the hole roster . An we can have a huge main roster free with free monthley new heros
🥰
They added dash attack
is it still floaty as fuck?
Lets go this game was fun idgaf!
Need Scooby Doo, Flinstones, Vampire Diaries, Big Bang Theory,  Sopranos, True Blood, Mortal Kombat, Ace Venture, Mad Max, Oceans Eleven, Wonka, Neo from Matrix, Harry Potter, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Robot Chicken, Ed Edd Eddy, Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy, Dexter's Laboratory, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo, Flash, Green Lantern, Cyborg, Aquaman, Hawkgirl, Joker, Peacemaker and More!! oh and Samurai Jack!!
Don’t remove mods again Saul Goodman in the game was amazing
I hope so much that the netcode revamp works. One of the only reason i stopped playing this game was because each match had a 40% chance of having unplayable lag.
Can’t wait to thug it out against annoying iron giant players
How awesome would it be to see the Animaniacs?
This is awesome, I’ve been waiting for this game to come back, and I’m even more excited to see where it goes from here. WB has so many vastly different properties under its belt, there’s countless options for characters. I’m still rooting for my boy Maxwell, since last I checked Scribblenauts is a WB property.
Wile E Coyote better not become a fighter or else this game is gonna get cancelled real soon.
I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!! I MISSED THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!
How long before Zaslav makes this a write off or just deletes the entire game after a few months
Switch version soon I hope!!!
Ok ok I’ll admit taking my 20$ and going radio silent to bring back Marvin the Martian AND THE GAME!? 95% worth it
New skull kid chair type theory:  The water tower is teasing playable animaniacs
just make sure superman says truth justice AND THE AMERICAN WAY
If the tower In the background  of the promo image is suppose to be acme loo then it BETTER dang well be actual real deal ORIGINAL tiny toon adventures and NOT I repeat NOT that nightmare inducing bend the knee pale imitation reboot its  buster and baby NO relation and it STAYS no relation
If the tower In the background  of the promo image is suppose to be acme loo then it BETTER dang well be actual real deal ORIGINAL tiny toon adventures and NOT I repeat NOT that nightmare inducing bend the knee pale imitation reboot its  buster and baby NO relation and it STAYS no relation
asia server one answer : yes or no
Now this... this has my kind of Harley Quinn and Velma Dinkley.
2:25 😂 im weak!
Honestly i just want to see Micheal Jordan on the roster replacing LeBron James
BEN 10 🙏🏻 GUMBALL AND DARWIN 🙏🏻
Welcome back MultiVerses🎉🎉🎉
Awesome, not a long wait at all. The game needs a type of landing lag so characters don't feel like they floating along the ground when they get their feet on the ground
This comes out on my graduation day omg 😭
This digital game was more good than ever! Im hope this game could survive and i'd like to play this game! More hopes for brand new dlc characters will be appeared soon in multiversus!
Imagine Samurai Jack Static Shock Neo Batman Beyond Flash all fighting each other on metropolis building. Already better than smash ultimate in my book. And it won't cost 60$ year round
Tony please let there be a story mode! 🙏
W
I just hope that Multiversus doesn't have a region cross lock.
Please get rid of the fps cap.. or at least get it to 120fps to match the newer consoles
Never felt so good proving the naysayers wrong
Yes
Add shields
I'm so HYPED LESS GOO
Still hoping for Monsterverse representation. And hopefully Warner Bros buys RWBY so it can be in a fighting game again.
I hate how everyone thinks they literally rebuilt the game from the ground up in 9 months. Falling for marketing hook line and sinker.  9-12 months is not enough time.  All they did was import their UE4 into UE5 and actually work on the netcode portion - something that should've been standard and there the first time around. You cant release a competitive fighter of any sort these days without proper netcode and yet they tried it.  Serious doubts whether they actually fixed any form of gameplay and the hundreds of legitimate criticisms of it. If they cared or were knowledgeable enough in the first place it would have never gotten to that stage like that.  Instead they're probs just back to throw out another billion battle passes, expensive characters that nobody really wanted and ignored how floaty and awful the gameplay actually felt.
Will you unban the restricted countries I wanted to play this game😢
Why May😢😢😢
YES!!!YES!!!YES!!!
My birthday is 29 may, i'm happy one gift is this comeback of my favorite fighter game like smash bros, i played so much ❤
IT'S ABOUT FRICKIN' TIME!!!!!! What took you guys so frickin' long?! Jkjk! I've been waiting very patiently ever since that open beta ended! Just showing my enthusiasm is all! So great to finally see you guys back after all these months!!! Can't wait to finally play your game again, as well as streaming a game for the very first time with MultiVersus!!!
Finally!😀Give us Ben 10 and more dc too
I just want Ben10 👀 (make him like Shulk!! its perfect!)
The stuff I bought better still be there
I was addicted to this game... Now I will be more addicted than ever
can we mod again? i feel as of it was a cool way to bring life to the game and possibly bring different ideas for characters to the game as it goes on
Given how the "beta" went I'm not as hyped. Plus I'm really looking at rivals of aether 2, which looks smooth as hell.  But depending what they've actually changed it could recover. I won't write it off.
I guess these developer should be called "Quadruple AAAA.".... I'll let myself out.
I am... slightly optimistic. Which is saying a lot these days because my default mode is distrusting every game developer now.
We are so back
AND IT’S STILL NOT ON THE SWITCH YET?! GOSH DANG IT!
This has to be my all time favourite platform fighter. I love the tag team aspect and I’m excited for it to return. Time for the reign of Lebron and Jerry.
I really hope they managed to optimize it this time so it can run smoothly on steamdeck. It was such a waste in OBT
Ok but can there be a Switch release please if Nintendo lets you😭
Day 400 still no ben 10, one day.
yeah no they lost my trust when they took away the game from us after what was it 2 seasons? probably all progress is lost too. nah. no with me.
imagine all 3 power puffs as one character 🤯
MAY 28TH HERE WE COME.
new moves! i’m guessing since they have ground move and air move. the next big thing is crouch moves
we’re so back
Sadly we probably won't get any RWBY characters now due to the recent events. I would really like to see characters like Ruby, Qrow or Neo in the game but that's not possible anymore
AND THEY'RE BACK! ❤
Warner Brothers = Trash.
I would've liked to see a new character or two as well, but I'm satisfied regardless.
They're just flexing on Smash at this point
Despicable things about to go down if daffy comes in!
Ma fille joue depuis pratiquement un an dans le Labo puisque le jeu est fermé et il n'y a pas de combat contre I.A. 😢 Donc quand je ne peux pas jouer avec elle c'est ce qu'elle fait. Elle est vraiment impatiente et va être ravi quand je vais lui apprendre la nouvelle 👧🏼😃👍🏻 Elle me demande toujours si il y aura des nouveaux personnages de Scooby-Doo et Titi et Grosminet 😄
Let's hope this video ages well
I’m still hoping for Ben 10.
im glad they are back, il be sure to play it on may 28th, gona mark that date.
I have nothing else to say but   I WONT BE PLAYING ANYTHING ELSE, NOTTING, NADDA,   I say NEAIH. Nay I say
There is a small chance for Thais game come to Nintendo SWITCH?
i saw the steam picture for the game change and I knew something was up XD
Not gonna lie, I thought this game was done once it got taken down and also because it's a WB property where things get cancelled all the time now but happy to see it's coming back
AYE do i get my shaggy skin?
Finally!
Yall missin the fact that we got Justin Roiland back LETTSSS GOOO
Best game
Looks like they finally fixed the whole “everything is safe and we can’t punish anything” glitch
We're so back, baby!
It's coming a few days after my birthday. I'm counting it as a gift. That makes me happy, I'm very excited. I really enjoyed playing the game, but got discouraged by the later passes.
1:19 OH! Now we all know why Multiversus was temporarily shutdown back then. They'll remake this game via UE5 for better netcode and graphics (as well as gameplay and optimizations too) UE5 (or 5.3, if not, 5.5) is SO GREAT. Besides, hope Ben, Dexter, Powerpuff Girls, and Ruby will make into the roster too
Alright I'm going to try to stay calm here.  You took my favorite game of all time and put it on Unreal Engine for no reason?  Have you seen the contrast in gameplay pace?  Did you know, that nobody wants Nick All Stars Brawl 3 which is what this looks like?    I hate that engine, this gameplay looks HORRIBLE compared to what we were feeling before...  You can say it's in progress, you can say we can't play it yet so we can't be sure, but just look, you can tell alright, that has become very slow, very clunky, and visually I'm not sure I care that it has any finer details when you pay in the form of having clunky slow engine holding back your gameplay??  I was so excited, I am probably your biggest fan, I gave you hundreds of dollars before you pulled the rug out from under us.  I want the good game back, that I supported, I don't think anyone wants a clunky trash fiesta on Unreal 5.    God... my soul... everyone told me not to keep my hopes up.. they kept telling me you were busy ruining the product... and they were probably right..  I know it's early, but please don't take our quality fast paced gameplay away and give us yet another unreal engine fighter that handles like molasses... :(  Unreal is overrated, hasn't been good since they made Unreal Tournament with it, and the transition for their series when it hit Unreal Tournament 3 became trash too btw, it's not just you. They killed their own title using their own engine, don't join them. PLEASE!!! AUUUUGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Reposted from IGN's upload of your frustrating update.
Yeeees !!!
WE BACK!!
Steven mains Rise up!
I hope we get the Warner siblings in they are Warner bros other mascot
I thought this game was dead
Maybe on the next Nintendo hardware?
Very excited the game is coming back! Guess it's also time to bring back #Ben10forMultiVersus
I feel like the only thing this game needs to keep players playing, is a story mode for every playable character, each one starts and ends with simple comics, and get maybe just six levels, and they are 2d platformer except for the final level which is a boss battle, the levels should at least try to use the character's moveset.
We need Anime Characters into Multiversus!
About fucking time been the only person commenting on facebook since the shutdown and got no reply from y'all's page.. excited nonetheless but stay humble!
Okay, but when the game was out, it wasn't "beta" and etc really.. yall released tons of battlepasses of content and we paid for stuff too.. is that just gone? I bought the whole Batman set which yall honestly overpriced, but I'm a Batman Main and grew up with Animated Series Batman.
they threw the kitchen sink at this game in order  to keep adding interesting kits. They had a great base with characters like wonder woman and superman, that mixed interesting utility "state changes" into their attacks. But every character they add seems to steer more into having projectiles for basic attacks, and uninteresting landmine style zoning.  great game at the core, but plagued by this "more is more" mentality. Instead of fulfilling the many suitable character fantasies they have in their IP library... you somehow end up with a batarang, being more of a playable character then Batman..
It's come BAAAAACK! ✊😄✊ I hope Warner and First Player Games don't let Multiversus dying again or I ve let throw hate to Warner corp.
Incoming 18 Batman nerfs and 20 Tom and Jerry buffs
So you quite literally in your “beta closing” statement that all the feedback is being taken into account, then you port the entire game into a new engine for some extra lighting and graphics essentially negating all feedback given to you.
Launch Wile E. Coyote
Launch Wile E. Coyote
Launch Wile E. Coyote
Launch Wile E. Coyote
Launch Wile E. Coyote
I actually missed this game, like it’s one of the games where u can use the phrase "u never know what u have until it’s gone"
I just want ben 10 in the game
YES
Lol, my guy Tony Huynh got his name wrong in the description, smh WB
Was expecting a character reveal...
they reworked harley😢
I respect a man who announces the release date first, what everyone really wants to know. 👍
We getting samurai jack, regular show and Ed, Edd n eddy fighters right!?!?!?!? So many ip potential
DEXTER'S COMING!!!
Yoooo this game was so luch fun  Had issues but loved the beta Cant wait for the full launch
FINALLY!!!! I’ve been waiting so longggg
I didn't enjoy the control scheme and was too lazy to change it at that time. Maybe someday soon I'll try again.
YUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
The main thing I wanted was a Local 2 vs 2 online. In the Beta, I couldn’t sit on the couch with my Player 2 and fight 2 other Players online. I could only team up with a stranger
FINN MAINS RISE UP
What Im most excited about is that it seems they added dash attacks and grabs, maybe even charged attacks separate from tilts, that alone would make the gameplay way less repetitive
LESSS GOOOOO
Hope you dev better than you lie.
🥹 *Y'all are just as beautiful as the day we lost you.*
Are they finally putting on Nintendo switch
Mobile?!
I wonder if Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden are gonna voice rick and morty in the game, i wanna see original lines and interactions with the other characters and not voice clips from the show.
I'll try it again... But if this doesn't work I'm going back to NASB2.
LETS GOOOO THEIR BACK
❤
why would i want to waste time on a lesser smash bros?
Yeeahhhh baby
I thought multiversus was like your dad and never will come back
The original was a lot of fun, even tho connection issues were kind of rampant.  Hoping the upgrades make things smoother, and less prone to disconnects.
UE5?! Great, now people will need to buy a PS5 in order to run this game!
Dexter's Lab and The Powerpuff Girls stages?!
Can they stop saying "launching" and say what we are all thinking; they are relaunching the game.
Quite the comeback story. I put lots of money in to it the first time and plan on playing again. It was really a lot of fun.
This literally comes out a day before my birthday! Can’t wait for this to come out!! LET’S GOOOOOO!!!
So you’re re releasing multiverses Because the first time you did it didn’t work out?  Greedy ass company
Can we have Black Hat from villainous as a character and not some goblins
In before they pull the plug 4 months later like they did the first time
We back ?! 🎉
Did anyone else notice Harley Quinn doing the Spinning Bird Kick that Chun Li used in Street Fighter?
Please tell me progress will carry over😔
Wakko Yakko and dot for multi-versus
Launch! Launch! launch! Launch!
IM GONNA SUFFER FROM SHAGGY MAINS AGAIN
As long as you bring back Iron Giant's super armor, everything's good
If we bought the founders edition do we get our stuff back tho?
Hey! If we made any purchases during the beta, would these carry over to the main game?  Just something that should probably get addressed sooner than later.
We need Ben 🟢⌛️
REMADE game from ground up with Unrealengine 5 for better graphics and netcode. New atks, better hit boxes, pve modes, new maps and more. Lets goo! Cant wait for beta and then the new launch!!
I hope the game is still team based
This is gonna be amazing
So is it regional or is it available worldwide?
Please don't start this "smash killer" bullcrap again.
Hell yeah , good to have you back tony
Is it coming on mobile too??
So the Powerpuff Girls and Dexter will be playable in the future since their stages have been confirmed, but what's the stage at 2:11?  Is that Hogwarts/Gryffindor stage?  I don't recognize it.
Who’s going to voice Batman now that Kevin Conroy is gone?
We’re back!
My favourite shows but this game seriously fell off
I hope every character has a shield
Do Dune!!!!
im so happy it's coming back!
PvE you say? Like the Smash Brothers Brawl & 3DS side scroller adventure mode where you platform and kill random creatures? :) Cuz I love those. No idea if Smash Ultimate even brought those back, never got  a Switch.
Let's hope the game is better optimized now, it used to be slow as fuck on my PC in the lowest settings, even though it meets the minimum requirements.
Add Omniverse or Classic Ben 10 and i will not leave this game
The Grift was insane you sold premium currency, multiple battle passes, and characters for a “beta”.🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Will it still be on Xbox one
YESSSSS I MISSED THIS GAME SO MUCH I WAS SO SAD THAT THE BUGS RUINED IT
This reminded me how much I miss this game.
Who here is going to main Dexter and The PowerPuff Girls
We let them cook and they sure did
YES SIR SKIS!!!!!!
Where’s scooby doo? Where are the MK characters? Where is Godzilla? Where is King Kong?
Those stages looked like the City of Townsville and Dexters Lab… I think that was a tease of characters to come! Powerpuff Girls and Dexter! . Would be funny to see Dexters Mom added as well 🤣
Honestly pretty upset with how they handled the announcements and updates. They tease us for 3 days after months of radio silence then the game isn't even gonna be out in 2 months. Poorly done IMO. Should've just kept quiet until game was closer.
i‘m definitely gonna give it another roll ❤️
Please put it on switch I beg of you there’s no new games they’re all terrible except Brawlhalla and fortnitey
Is the game gonna be available in asia this time around?
Genuinely can’t wait. So hyped to see the game back.
It's time.
Switch version please. #MultiVersusOnSwitch
honestly hearing theres a PvE mode is the biggest thing I'm happy about, it was a bit of a slog when you can only fight against online players bc you gotta deal with some real pieces of work
WE ARE SO BACK
I forgot this game even existed. Don’t think anyone really cares anymore
LETS FUCKING GO TONY, SLAMMACOW
Game looks great and I'm so glad you're adding more from the CN roster, but please, for the love of all that is merciful, put the damn game on the Switch

Finally I was on the edge of my seat this month waiting for anything related to this game. I LOVED IT and can’t wait to play this again 🎉🎉🎉
WHY YALL NOT GOING TO PUT IT ON NINTENDO
Is it going to be on Nintendo switch?
Wow, so you teased everyone for a week just to come back after a year with two pieces of concept art, a PVE mode we don't get to see, no sign of the new characters, awkwardly bigger characters, a delay out of the promised Early 2024 release, and dash attacks?   Way to knock the relaunch out of the park, guys
WELCOME BACK! WE MISSED YOU MVS
so.... are we not gonna talk about the monetization? that was the thing that worried me most, other than the lack of competitive leading to sweats online.
Game was way too floaty
all I ask is grinding for characters to be lil bit better
Already got both platinum 😁
I'm so incredibly happy that I get to play this game again! 😁
I really hope they add a vunch of new characters to bring this game to its fullest potential
We are baack!!!
Walter White for Multiversus <3
Is Marvin the only new character wtf?
I hope getting new characters isn’t as much of a hassle as it was.
You better add that 3v3 or squads gameplay MULTIVERSE!!!
LET'S GOOOOO!!!!
I am so hyped for this, I'm ready for May
I hope the previous founder pack owners get a little something 😂
"open beta" lol
I missed you so much tony
SUPERMAAAAAANNNN
RANKED OR NO DICE 🧊🫡👍
Finally after a year of waiting it’s the perfect time for multiversus  to release
Launches may 28th
And with Smash Bros completed, Multiversus can join in on the big brawl between Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6
Ben 10?
No switch release? That's sad
Please sir tell me if there's going to be a traditional four player mode
When youre old enough to understand the iludium Q36 explosive space modulator reference...
I'm seeing a lot of hype for this, but y'all... this is all just upgrading the stuff that did work. Multiversus originally died because of the stuff that DIDN'T work, and there's no news if any of it's changed.  If 95% of the roster is still locked behind either money or massive grinding, characters have too many abilities/mechanics, and the game still feels slow and floaty, it's going to die just as quickly as it relaunches
#Ben10formultiverses
My biggest hope for this game: Single player campaign, and local play. I have bad internet, so online play isn't something I can do so those two things, one that gives a story mode to the game, and allows a friend to grab a controller and play while we're in the sae room, gives me something to do, cause I REALLY wanna play this game.
Is levels and stuff going to reset?
Seeing Multiverse add PVE before overwatch is wild
I only have one thing to say: DONT FUCK IT UP
Sweet!
Parece cópia do jogo da Nintendo
CANT WAIT TO PLAY AS DEXTER WELCOME BACK!
Nmms si se va a hacer esa mmda?
Please give us more game of thrones or house of the dragon characters.   The hound or jaime lanister would be cool
I don't like to be saying it but I am going out on a limb and saying not much will have changed ultimately.  As much as I want it to do well.  Not saying this out of some bitter disregard or anything.  I just lack confidence.
I am really rooting for this game to succeed.
I have no doubt ppl enjoy this game, but I feel like, with all the competition, I feel like it'll fizzle out again :/
we are so back yall
HYPEE!! I HOPE THEY ADD WALTER WHITE
Dang. Happy Birthday to me.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Это го не работает
What about all of my already paid character brah?!!!
Chale que mal que no esté para nintendo Switch 😢
Mobile please?
WBD will close the studio a day before launch for a tax write-off. Calling it now.
wheres walter?
Hoping for a team attack enabled 2v2 option!!!!
I CANT FUCKING WAIT IVE BEEN WAITING SOOOOO LONG.  I NEED TO REACH TOP 5k AGAIN ASAPpppp
I think I saw Townsville and Dexter's Laboratory @ 1:13.
I wonder if they will change batmans voice but still have the option to have the old voice lines from kevin as a way to pay respect to him
For me, what matters most will be if I can play it offline.
Can't wait to ruin all of you on release.  Signed: #1 Finn player in the ranking from games OB release to server shut down.
I’m glad that it’s coming out in may because it means more time for them to fix a few more things up as long as the game plays well then it’s worth the wait
I'm really glad this game is coming back! surprised, too, considering WB's track record lately.
I DIDNT SPEND $40 FOR NOTHING🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
yo
Long as i see Dexter & Jack when the game comes back, i'll be pleased.
Welcome back Multiversus. Welcome back
All I ask is Al G Rhythm as a boss in the PvE mode and you add Courage the Cowardly Dog. Thanks
It's good to see they finally revived this game and have a fighting chance now
Dead on arrival
Did Harley Quinn always had that Spinning Bird Kick attack in the game or is that new?
Hopefully the joker come out 🃏
But what about Batman? With Kevin not with us anymore we can't get new  dialogue interactions. So what's going on with that?
The fact that they re-built the game from the ground up is fascinating.
cant wait to see the full roster
WE'RE SO BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I loved this game ! I'm happy to see his lounch ! I need to ask, do we keep all the skin and experience we got on the beta ? Because i had some good skins i loved !
It will die in a week
I played the beta and I liked it but it needed some polish and that looks like what I wanted to see.   Can’t wait to jump back in.
metan a ben 10 y a walter white por dios santo
Lost a lot of faith. But I'll still give it a shot.
Walter white in Multiversus plis
Dead game 😂😂😂
I'd grown bitter and spiteful over time after an extended bout of silence, and then you go and do something like this... and totally redeem yourselves! Overused reference aside, rebuilding the game to make it run better is admirable, and seeing gameplay reminded me that I actually really enjoyed how this game played. So fuck it, I'm excited about MultiVersus again
Huh
The new graphics are looking great so far, stages based on the Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory is fantastic since we needed classic Cartoon Network reps, and giving each character a dash attack is an interesting way to spice up the gameplay. I'm excited for the relaunch, and hopefully they'll make more announcements until then. Of course I want to see new characters and stages, but I'm hoping to also see whether there'll be a story mode and I really hope they'll give Reigndog his voice finally.
Praying for Gumball
I thought this game was dead
Hope it's on switch
Let’s go. I’m hype to finally check this game out, once it comes out. ❤🌌💫
No Harry Potter stuff!?
FINALMENTE DIAS DE GLORIAAAA
Nintendo switch on multiversus please
May 28th is insane
please bring tony soprano to multiversus and give him a bathrobe outfit and a duck related special move
Don’t get excited for this sad excuse of a platform fighter, support actually good platform fighters instead
I really hope through all these changes and updates they added couch co-op but probably not.
Good to see y'all back. May the general public enjoy the new Multi-Versus enough to protect you from David Zaslav's wrath.
let's fucking go
Bring Static or I riot 😭😭🥺
I never seen those before
When will it come out for Nintendo Switch?
Wait are those new attacks?
WE ARE BACK INDEED
Can you please add Daffy Duck
Welcome back, Multiversus!
WE ARE SO BACK BABY LFGGGGGG
I’m so hype bro omg
Multiversus is an awesome game, really excited for the relaunch, especially the new single player mode that they've teased.
Characters are way too big in the gameplay footage. Don't like that change at all.
Yesssss 🎉i Hope there is gonna be a tmnt Cooperation ❤
Ben Tennyson (classic) Courage the cowardly dog Red Hood  That would be so cool and fresh for the game. Im Happy because i get the 60$ version and i keep the Battle pass ticket and so many character tickets
2 months is nothing. Sounds amazing
HELL YEAAAA
WE ARE SO BACK! 🔥🔥🔥🗣🗣🗣🗣
I forgot about this
Fire Zaslav!
The live service aspect is going to kill this game. I think it would have done far better as a full-priced Smash Bros. competitor with no live service element.
This game will underperform so hard, and it's sad.
Praying for uncle grandpa or Billy & Mandy stuff
Please focus a lot on PvE cause there's tons of players like me who hate frustrating online PvP crap!
Stoked for the return
It's scummy that they made the game unplayable for an entire year. They should have handled it better. I'm excited though.
the space modulator gag was top notch based Marvin
You still have that piece of shit liberal LeBron James? No final smashes? Same free to play garbage? Nah. I hope this fails. It's trash.
Let's Go I can wait till May 28 to play this & love the game looks different then the open beta also I really hope they reveal more Characters before the game launch on This May.  P.S. I hope that Rick and Morty have actual Voice Lines in the Game cause during the Open Beta it's just Voice Clips for the show
My only concern is Batman's voice😢
There's lots of implications between the new stages and new splash art that Dexter, Powerpuff Girls, Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain are all gonna be there on launch... Literally the 4 biggest ways you could've brought me back, all at once.  Incredible.
I hope sonic the hedgehog and Garfield add in multiverse
I want a Nintendo Switch port of this game!
Criaram hype pra isso? Marketing patético, anúncio fraco e data de lançamento no meio do ano. Decepcionante. Early 2024 😂 piada de mau gosto
WE'RE BAAAAACK!!!!!!
This looks and sounds great but I still feel like I've got trust issues. You launched a game, took money sold characters and seasons and it was all a Beta. That's not gonna happen again, right?
I'm said it doesn't release until late May, but it's nice to get an update!
WHERE’S THE SWITCH VERSION
MidVersus expect shitty netcode
Neato! It’s coming back.
I CAN NOT WAIT!!!
Now you guys better not screw this up like you already did when you shut the game down last June. But no matter what, Warner Bros. is still pathetic thanks to that prick, David Zaslav. Really, just pathetic.
Gimme Nightwing
Wish itwas on switch
Will be on Nintendo Switch?
Only concept arts? The game has been down for over a year and you can only give us concept art?
quando vai lançar para nintendo switch?? 😢
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAA BABY!
Return of the GOAT
Looking forward to it.
Couldn't  we swap out LeBron for Michael jordan
I loved the beta for the game however the weekly and daily missions were way too grindy. that was my main complaint and the main reason I dropped off near the end of season 2. I am more than willing to play again I just the daily and weekly missions are fixed
So you guys still going to charge people for season pass content on this early access game and then remove it later? Instead of just making a full game and releasing it? No that would be stupid wouldn't it.
FOWLMOUTH- LIGHTS ARE DIMMING LIGHTS ARE DIMMING
Please be on mobile lunch
Please come to mobile soon
HOLY SHIT I AM SO HYPED
Mars for Marvin🗣🗣🗣
As long as netcode is improved and nobody is teleporting anymore then ill be satisfied
ui ui multas, voltou é
asia server?
Add ben10
Fingers crossed for less predatory microtransactions!
Will be by the game like in game stop and all because I don't do online stuff or buy that much games on ps4 I prefer to buy the disc for ps4
Let’s gooo
That Marvin part was funny ngl😂😂😂
I never loss hope💯
I'm hoping Wile E. Coyote will become a playable character later eventually the poor guy deserves better on how WB has treated him but I'm excited this game is back!
We need Walter White in the game
Add muscle man to multiversus
We are so back
Since Smash Ultimate ended with the release of the Sora Amiibo, and a minor update, we needed something to take its place.  I hope that this is that game, again.
explain yourself
Love this game
Please just add mordecai and rigby i beg of you
ben 10??? plz
Yess let’s goooo
Yes im going to finish unicorn Overlord and start Smashing again in multiverses 😁😊👍
YEAH BABY! WE’RE BACK BOY!!!!
Saudades de você meu amor
2 and a half more months! I might hurt somebody. 🥪💨 (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻       This release better be squeaky clean 🧐      🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Let's go multiversus🔥
i cant wait to play this game again
What about arcade mode?
I never thought it would come back, but it is! I've missed it!
May 28th… man guess I gotta contain some more hype
I love the Marvin hack XD
Gameplay still looks jank, oh well, it's over
what a clown fiesta, imagine creating a game full of bugs, glitch and everything else, with no competitive scene/no ranked in 2023 and trying again in 2024
“This part of my life, this little part, is called happiness"  - A fan.                             Lets go 1k hour on steam!
Lesgoo 😤💪!!!!
We are so fucking back.
Hoping they keep consistently adding new characters because waiting months for a Gremlin is probably one of the reasons why the player count dropped so much.
28 of march
Shame I will never get the fighters I want, considering their creators lost their jobs and WBD's trying to sell it off. But we should be lucky we're still getting the game.
is it me or does it look much slower than before?
Walter White when?
I missed this game!!!
Happy the game is back I miss it so much
hopefully its not a nightmare to unlock ppl this time around
Lets go i hope the flash is a character
LETS GO I’M SO EXCITED  Crossing my fingers for a switch release
Ooo new netcode ok well. Jake. Curious to see how the game changes 🤔
I hope they focus more on 1v1 since that's what fighting games do best
Physical release with all characters unlocked PLEASE
i hope the whole player base will comeback
Estou no Hype para o grande retorno de Multiversus
Quedamos 🤡
YEAAHHHH FINALLY I MISS THIS GAME SO MUCH 😭
No Switch version ?   Come on, it's literally the platform where this game has the best chance of being successful.
Please inprove the music becsuse its honestly bad in my opinion
I like how none of this addressed the actual issues. Namely, the predatory battle pass and the lack of a strong core game.   Multiversus dropped off because the offerings were so minuscule for such an aggressively demanding grind. Attention died because people got bored. Loading your roster with characters lacking a strong legacy (Steven Universe, Rick & Morty, Gremlins, f*cking Space Jam — nobody asked) and forced corporate picks (Stop trying to make Harley a thing; why would you put Black Adam before any other DC villain) did nothing to help.  Remember there was going to be a story mode? A guaranteed way to drum up hype? The Nothing from Neverending Story as the Tabuu/Galeem analogue, never remotely went anywhere, now will be even harder with certain voice actors having passed on? Yeah, whatever happened to that bit?  "We improved netcode tho", cool. _Give us something to do with it, first, howabout._
Don’t let this distract you from the fact that WB just sacked all of Roosterteeth
Omg we are so back 🎉
Ah yes! Multiversus is coming back!
I just wished they made movement snapper, the didn't and I am kinda sad
Can't wait to play! Hope the release date is for all countries and not just specific ones. Sad that this missed out on the Switch, but I do hope this comes out on its successor.
:DDDDD
I hope i will got my skin back
Sweet)!
WE EATING GOOD
Multiversus returning on my birthday is a W that i desperately needed
YOOOOOOOOOO WERE SO BACKKK
Will the full game release will be region locked? Because the beta was not available in my country India. Make this game playable to us too : )
I'm not crying! You're crying!
Take your time guys
YES LOVE THIS GAME, BUT PLEASE ALL I NEED IS BEN 10
LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
People who want Dante from dmc to join the roster 👇
Awesome
Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff, ANIMANIACS?! Oh my god....
I'm about to analyze every frame of this video
Leetttsss' gooooo ❤
that's a while away, yknow, considering people paid up to 90 quid or so on the game 😑
Do not kill it with many micro transactions please!
super
Get hype!!!!🔥💯
Que decepção o jogo vai falir desse jeito
WHERE IS GODZILLA!?!? WHEN ARE Y'ALL ADDING MY BOI G!?!?
Finally!!!!!
WE'RE BAAAAAAACK 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is gonna be fun to play
Que vuelve la leyenda
I’m so glad they didn’t pull off an overwatch 2
gente, hoy revivio el gaming
NIntendo switch port when?
didnt this game flop lol
Gente que decepção nem um personagem novo e só teremos multiversus em maio de 28😢😢
Finally, hope has arrived 🥹
I missed this game so much
Dont fuck it up
Can't tell but it does look a lot less floating and it looks like the combos have more hitstun! Hell I'm very excited but I really wish they showed a new character...or 2 😅 At least we're finally out of beta
NEED to have faster character progression and battlw pass progression. It started off good, but damnt hey nerfed it so hard and was so frustrating
I hope this game comes for the switch and/or switch 2 🙏
you see i would care but you're delisting duck game so i dont anymore
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK AND GIVING US AN UPDATE! I’m sorry you had to rebuild the game, but I’m actually really happy you decided to do that to make the game better! I hope to see more in the future! (I’m also hoping for Ben 10 to be shown😭)
They better add some Rooster teeth characters
Where’s Walter white and Gustavo fring? Don’t tell me you forgot multiversus
That netcode better deliver or the this game will really die.
"I thought you died... My death was, greatly, exaggerated."
The fact that we have a Townsville map means we should get The Powerpuff Girls
We coming back 🎉❤
Add it to the switch 🗣️🗣️🗣️
LETS GOO, THE GAME WILL COME BACK   Things that cannot be missed in the game are also new characters (like Ben 10, the Animaniacs, Daffy Duck), and more global dubbing, in my country (Portugal) there was no dubbing and I had to play either in English or Brazilian Portuguese
Add Walter white
I really hope this game can stay alive this time, i'm not a huge fighting game fan, but i really like some of the coss-overs and you can tell that the devs are passionate about it.
Teen Titans Robin 🤔
Giving me Overwatch vibes with their presentation
I hope that those old rumors of you guys adding Godzilla to the game are true, especially with the new movie.
I’m so excited ♥️♥️
PLEASE say they added servers in ASIA 🙏🙏🙏
FINALLY! WE ARE BACK!!!
Vai lançar para mobile ou não
Need to see Courage the Cowardly Dog along with Cow and Chicken please! Also, PLEASE add offline player vs bot modes and offline bot vs bot modes!
Ok….
Missed yall man can’t wait to main tf outta Dexter. Please release something weekly so the drought can be quicker
Any more new characters we could expect in this game?
I expect no lesson learn
1 whole year and they spent the time rebuilding the game from the ground up to not show actual new content.  this game is basically the SAME game everyone left in two weeks, you can't survive with the online supporters, multiversus and DC fans are the same, they are online but not playing or in theaters.  the same spammy mess will kill this game again
I wonder about the Battle Pass. It was so involved last time I couldn't enjoy playing the game because I was too busy trying to fill out the BP.
fellas, remember, the money they make out of this, is going to david zaslav, fuck this game, and fuck warner
I'm sleep. Looks like the same game
Oh boy, super close to getting the og PPGs as fighters!!🤞
so, you release a game and have microtransactions in it, kill it for a year and come back?  ill never play this again dude
we back fr
I'm so excited for this game to come back, I was playing it constantly in open beta, looking forward to checking out all of the changes the team have made!
WE ARE SO BACK LEEEEEETS GOOOOOOO
There's a lot of movesets you can get from Cartoon Network Punchtime XL I wonder if that game will help as inspirations for the PPG and Dexter
Yes may 28th
We better get coconut fred
❤❤❤
Animaniacs and Neo pleeeeeeaaassseeeeee
This the year for Multiversus 🔥🔥🥹!!
cant wait till may 28 to play this again, im just hoping it has asian servers now..
Let’s GOOOO! 🧨
we are so back.
yessssss i missed multiverse been stuck playing that crappy nick version
why is the game SO SLOW ???
PLEASE ADD MOBILE 😭😭
Still no release on the Switch. Put it on the Switch please. Otherwise, I ain't gonna play it.
Pelao Tony, dame alguna alegría 😢
Will there be an option to play against computer players like in Smash?
I never realize this game is still in Open Beta....
I missed the game so much
Are you gonna remove regionlock on SEA? There's people who bought the battlepass who got screwed over the closed beta
Cant wait to see whos coming! Id love to see Spy Vs Spy or Samuari Jack!
Its all?,where is Walter White,Openheimer and Barbie?!?
Multibros we are so freaking back!! I love this game!
CAN WE GET NEO AND TRINITY FROM THE MATRIX!? Would be LEGIT!!!!
Why is it so long away 😮
One of the problems I had with Multiversus was how floaty everyone was and it seems like they didn't fix that.
Multiversus, please, let it be the Original Powerpuff Girls with the original voice actors, Cathy Cavadini as Blossom, Tara Strong as Bubbles and EG Daily as Buttercup!
I think the unreal update wasn’t needed people love smash and it looks like shit so that doesn’t matter to me. They teased 3 characters in ppg, dexter, and the animanacs which is cool but the may 28th release date is the wrong move that’s 78 days from now and the game is basically coming out in the second half of the year not early like they said. That tells me the game will have the same problems it had when it was in bata and the game will just die again in less then a year.
Is just me or the characters look bigger😅
Powerpuff Girls, Dexter from Dexter's Lab and a new Game of Thrones stage, presumably for a Lannister... I'd be VERY interested to see how Tyrion or Jamie play in this style!  Welcome back, Multiversus! You were missed! And we would have been REALLY mad if you nabbed Fighting Game of the Year at TGA and then left for eternity! :D
Hopefully the update for characters wont take as long, or at the very least have more planning to them along with keeping players in the loop.
>aiming for competitive players  >leveling up in a fighter
This is animaney and totally insaney this awesome game is back and   THOSE ARE THE FACTS!
Love that PVE!!!
Marten
l am ready
YAAAAYYY❤❤❤
We better get beetlejuice,breaking bad
We're back baby
YIPPIE!!!
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy
Officially New Characters: Dexter,Dee Dee,Powerpuff Girls,Ben 10,Animaniacs,P&B,Joker,Mordecai,Rigby and Scooby Doo
I have been waiting
I hope the Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Lab stages mean we'll also be getting fighters from those shows!  I might be willing to pay real money to play as Dexter, the Powerpuff Girls, Mojo Jojo, Johnny Bravo, Cow and Chicken, and Samurai Jack!
I eeally hope we get this type of update videos every 2 or 3 weeks, so the wait isn't as bad
Ok will we be able to see Ben 10 Tennyson from Prime timeline?
*WHERE'S BEN TENNYSON/BEN 10*
Shessshhh
AYO MULTIVERSUS ISNT DEAD THATS COOL
Switch: Am I a joke to you?
Asian player can play now right? Right?
Android
very easy solution make all characters available lower cosmetic price or at least make the game less grindy and cancel the battlepass or have people earn gleamium from it
I'll cry
Not bad
Hell yeah So happy to hear this news
Anybody else noticed Black Adam looks huge now?? Also I hope we've done some changes to armor or just done away with it all together.
Local coop play would be nice.
Cool cool… but like, where Ben 10 at!?!?
dream chars : Katniss , Harry Potter , Neo , any MK char prob wont happen but V for Vendetta
PHEW
Oh hell yeah multiversus is back baby
Man i hope the gameplay feels smooth because that was the issue before
has it already been released in Italy?
better be avalible in asia this time
I thought this game was dead.
They made a PvE mode, already leagues ahead of Riot.
Please say the monetization model has changed
IT'S BACKKKKK
Can't wait, still hoping for Freakazoid, spear n fang, and Sam jack(not the actor)
WE ARE SO BACK GUYS 🗣🔥
Really glad to hear you guys reworked the netcode.  Rollback is great, but 4 players in such a fast game just really pushed the envelope.  Lots of footage showed the rollback in the beta turn kills into deaths.
I’m about to main Tom and Jerry and nobody can stop me
Will it be on Nintendo Switch?
Black Adam is not The Rock anymore lol
A whole years of development, and the best thing you could show us is a handful of concept art and that the game looks SLIGHTLY better?
Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! ???
Let’s goooo we baccckkk!!!!!! 😃
Yeah, no. WB has proved they're absolutely a garbage company and I won't forget the "lol oh that was just a beta actually, thanks for the real world money for the battle pass and deluxe editions though." You can't sell a Deluxe Edition of a beta. But WB loves to skirt the lines of legality, huh?
Excited to see more characters XD
I hope character mechanics are simplified somewhat, the previous build of the game had so many things to keep track of for even the easiest characters.
The most hype from WB while the other games and films are crashing and burning.
#MultiVersus #MultiVersus2024 #MultiVersusGANG #MultiVersusBEATSmashBros #MultiVersusBEATSmashBrosANDBrawlhalla #Viral #ViralVideo #ForYou #ForYouPage
Switch port?
We are so back
Tbh let's hope they fixed everything and made it good so it can last for a couple of years
So umm   Shield?  Parry?  1v1?  Physical copy?   Anything else?
🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
Yeeees im so hyped!!!😆
1:15 - the Lab... THE FREAKING LAB!!! Basides Tom and Jerry I guess who's my next main character will be
But will it be a brand new trophy list?
Would love if this game was accessible for the blind, but I understand. It will be too complicated. A screen reader will be a good start
ADD BEN 10 plz
They needed UE5 so the engine could handle 0.0000001% of Shaggy's power.
Really enjoyed this game, hopefully it can keep its playerbase this time around.
A little bit of a deeper DC cut, but I mean if fucking Black Adam can get in, I NEED LOBO
um, i remember the multiversus beta. then the multiversus game launch, then season 1 and then even a season 2. they took everyone's money then closed the game. now they're gaslighting us and pretending like the game was only ever on beta. yikes. "do-over guys, that first launch didn't count. thanks for the money though."
It makes sense that this game wouldn't have died when Warner Brothers is destroying so much content right now. It's like their only other live service game in the pipeline.
Congrats and will check again soon
Let’s go
I'M SO EXCITED!!
Yes We Are Back
Aí sim! Amava jogar esse jogo, já estou pronto pro lançamento!
may 28th feels awful man
Nice to hear from Tony again! I hope the team is doing well and I cant wait to see what you have in store for us in the coming weeks!
Looks like they nerfed Taz into the ground, dead game on arrival ☠️
1:50 Does this mean you're finally adding both tilt and strong physical attacks to the game? Finally, the lack of that made the gameplay so bland and repetitive
The best platform fighter is back!
I want  Scorpion( Hanzo or Kuai Liang)for Multiversus
And nintendo switch Out again :/
This 2 month wait will be worth it. I love multiversus
Can we have supers like smash
Let’s go it is finally coming back
I'm curious if Kevin Conroy's voice will still be used for Batman or not
I hope the game has a Story Mode.
I hope they learned their lesson and don't launch characters because of movies launching or as media stunts and most importantly be cristal clear with the community....well time will tell
The battle passes better have currency and not be so grindy
:D
Am I the only one who thinked this was gonna be a sequel?
Can we all agree that we want Batman to drive his Batmobile please add this this is the only thing I want like how wario drives his motorcycle in smash bros please add this
No switch?! Yall are waiting to launch it on SWITCH 2, huh
28 de mayo😭
BEETLEJUICE FOR THE ROSTER,I NEED IT.
I don't see this doing well the main issue was nobody liked the forced 2v2 gameplay everyone just wanted a smash clone and wanted to play free for all with stock
ITS HAPPENING
The fact they rebuilt the game from the ground up really speaks volumes. That explains why they were radio silent for so long.  *EDIT:* Aaaaaand it's dead again. This time for good. Classic WB.🙄😑😔
Still not on nintendo switch
Hearing the music, seeing the stages and seeing Tony.... I've missed this game SO MUCH
Let's Go!!!!
It's 2024 nobody cares about MultiVersus anymore
😑😑🤨🤨
LESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
UE5 is a big deal for future proofing this game, and better netcode!? Can't wait for launch!
I'm sad MV isn't back to the 28th of May but I waited this long. I missed this game
Still no Switch port. It sucks being poor lol.
its time
This is going on my birthday bro💀
YESSSSSSSSSS
We are so back
Thx ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤
May is too long
Oh wow it doesn't use the new WB logo
i'm a Lebron James main lolx... last character i ever thought i'd like or main...
can't wait to see this game dying in two weeks again 🔥
Bummer that we have to wait until May 28th but I am confident its going to be a great launch when it happens. Excited to see we are getting Dexter and The Powerpuff Girls.
Will there still be story modes for each character (along with their personal rivals similar to Playstation All-Stars Battle Royale did with theirs endings), DLC Passes for each new fighter who didn't make the cut, and so on?
May 28th
Is Lola bunny ( looney tunes show ) in this game? She would be so funny
Excited to finally try MVS for the first time, AND it’ll be in an improved state!
But can I block?
Happy New Year!!!!
IS this game alivable in JP? Whether or not, I'll play via VPNs🥶
May 28th 💀
Can we get asian severs 🥲
I'm glad they never gave up on this game 👍
Harley Quinn has Spinning Bird Kick now? Awesome!
I do think this game will fall off again if it doesnt change the way new characters are introduced
I hope you add Red Hood, but godd job!
0:57 im excited for the game to return but what did yall do to steven he looks so weird now 😭😭😭
WE'RE BACK
The Asia player still waiting the server
BROO I'M HYPED
Put Goku in the game.
WE USED TO PRAY FOR TIMES LIKE THESE 🙏🙏🙏
Is it a coincidence that the clapper🎬 is the same colour has the flag of Mauritius 🇲🇺 one day before the date of it's independence (12 March)?
WE ARE SO BACK
We MISSED YOU GUYS  we can't wait to play with those changes and see if our feedback was heard, see you then !
DEXTER!!!
Boy, it took them long enough to make this Smash Bros. clone.   And I suppose it’ll be worth it.
I just can't wait for may 28th 🎉
Ah, Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. Classic.
Very excited… I hope the game plays well like it did in beta with fast paced gameplay. Hopefully May will bring a cinematic trailer with new characters, maps, and covers all the enhancements to the game. Please market this game well leading up to the relaunch!
This game is gonna be even more awesome than before
I want to be excited but that was a weak and weird video.
Okay now give us the flash 😈
Man may 28 😢
I thought this got cancelled.
Please just give us a switch port
HYPE
What a time to be alive. 🧓
Please please please don't nerf everyone like you did last time, Nerfs kill hype and in the end your game. Don't make the same mistake. I'm rooting for your guys, so don't kill the hype, don't nerf your game to the ground.
I love how all the characters Multiversus has added is showed to all be just walking around the studio just getting up to random shenanigans which is kinda cool Like how at the end when Tony was saying goodbye they all interrupted That’s really fun and charming
This is more excitement as I expected 😢✊🏻
I never played the game before, but it's launching 10days after my birthday, so I'll give it a shot!😊❤
How is end of may early 2024
❤❤❤❤
IT'S TIME...
were BACK
Multiverse !
LESSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, If we get the Powerpuff girls man that'd be crazy!
Please add Bettlejuice, Kong, Godzilla, Hal Jordan and Peacemaker in the game 🙏
cannot wait for walter and jesse to be announced
I just got secret information that this might be game of the year
WOW WHAT A GAME! See you all in May. Bring your A game >:)
Seems like well spend time!
As the infamous Agent Stone once said, "HE'S BAAAAAACK!!!"
WB is becoming greedier than EA, so I’m cautious
PLS BE IN ASIA 😫
WE BACK
QUE ALEGRIA
It'll just die, again. Small sweaty crowd will not be sustainable for GaaS.
May Isn’t early 2024 it’s Mid 2024
Let's see how it goes
The Return Of Peak 2022
TONY, NEW MECHANICS, THE POWERPUFF GIRLS CLASSICS AND DEXTER STAGES, OH MY GAWD, I MISS YOU SO MUCH GUYS!!! 😭😭😭❤
As long as the online ACTUALLY works this time, this is gonna be really cool game. That’s gonna be one of the make or breaks for me and a lot of ppl.
Hope you guys took some elements from the Nickelodeon all star games. Those right there are some of the best platform fighters I’ve played and has honestly taken my preference over smash as far as gameplay. Hopefully with the new engine and time it’s had to be worked on this becomes like that
disappointing
I hate Garnet and Bugs for stopping the reveal of what we'll do until multiversus is back 👀 👀 👀
ESTÁ VOLTAAANDOOOOOOO!!❤❤❤❤
WOW Nice!!! Let's go!🤩
No switch? 💀💀💀
I can't wait to see how the new net code feels and how the game is going to look with all of the updates built from the ground up. Remembering how you all retweaked ALL of the hit boxes during the first Early Access period, I'm expecting awesome stuff.
летсгоооу 💪💪👍
Finally we’re back in business
Nenhuma garantia de boneco novo?
28 MAY? I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE 😭
Ayooooooo
How long until this game becomes a tax write-off too?
I can’t wait to play Rick and Morty again
WERE SO BACK
Finally! I missed it so much
YESSSSSSSSS!!🔥🔥🔥
May 28th!! Welp time to start counting down the days
We will see Goku in Multiversus?
"From the ground up"...Forza motorsport 🙂
I want Steamboat Willie
Cadê o Ben 10?
BRING IT TO NINTENDO SWITCH!!!
Been to long from last time we saw Tony
Hell yeah ❤
🥲🥲🥲
It's cartoon networking time
I AM SO EXCITED
LETS GOO
Those new stages look awesome!
Lets go!
Alright, Powepuff girls and Dexter confirmed 🤩🎉🎊
After such a long wait all we got was stage concept art come on man
Please Add Goku it's been a long days we wanted our man in Multiversus and this is the only thing before Akira Toriyama passed away
MAY 28
🔥🔥🔥
LETS GOOOO
MULTIVERSUS MULTIVERSUS MULTIVERSUS  may28 WE BACK BABY!
The gameplay in this video was really off putting. Why were the characters so big in some of the highlights? What was with the weird janky looking slowdown, it looks odd. I'm still excited for the game but it looks so off.
Not the PVE modes it gives me the Overwatch flashbacks...
MAY 28 LET'S GO!!!
WE’RE BAAAAACK
It comes out the same day as killer klowns
Oh HELL YEAH
THEY ARE BACK!!! LET'S GOOOOOO!!! WE WILL BE THERE, NO MATTER WHAT!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This game better live up.
You have my trust!
I wonder if Pibby could be added to this roster? I mean that would bring tons of FNF fans and pibby fans into this game. 😅
Holy shit, rebuilding the game from the ground up in UE5 instead of UE4? That's way more than I had expected. I also noticed some nice chunky hitstun to attacks that make them look more weighty. And colored smoke trails now instead of the uncolored grey as before.
FINALLY, I've missed you Multiversus!! 😭😭
I'M SO HAPPY IT'S COMING BACK!
Can't wait to be back! Looks incredible🦇
I really hope they balanced the dodge so you have more time to punish whiffed moves, and made the hitboxes better match the visuals (thinking specifically of finn...)  also pls fix iron giant grab cheese, it was my main and that shouldn't be his optimal playstyle  can't wait to see the new characters tho
As a person who has loved this game ever since the announcement but hasn't been able to play due to no Asia Servers. I want to ask will there be Asia Servers in the relaunch
Maaayyy 28th WOOP WOOP
LET'S GO!!!!  I'm so excited for the launch! Thank you, Player First Games!
to this day, i still love Multiversus man! here's hoping for a successful launch!
THANK YOU TONY! 🤩🤩😍😍
Multiversus finally can’t wait to play it again
Quick warning but the video doesn’t show up on mobile unless you click on the channel then go to the videos tab instead of home. Or unless it pops up in the feed, so you should quickly fix that so that it’s easier to see so this news doesn’t go unnoticed.
And now we all play the waiting game... Again.
graphical changes that make the game appear WORSE, a few lame ass stages and a new mode?. OMG THIS GAME IS BACK BABY OMG WOW  more money put into the fucking mcdonald’s promotion than the team. SO TRAGIC
FINALLY!!! YESS! Oh, I miss the heck out of this game so much!! I've been practicing with my main skilled characters ever since it shut down for a while! Thank God it got its release date return! Hallelujah! 🥳🙏☺️
Let's go team!!!!
Finally we can play again soon ❤
Story mode please
28 may is a way to long in my opinion
Here we go😎
WE ARE SO BACK WITH THIS GAME!!!!! I MISSED THIS GAME AND BUT IT IS STILL GOOD AND AMAZING!!!!!!!
The Powerpuff girls are coming. My most wanted characters. Thank you so much PFG for bringing my childhood icons to the game
2:17 the part everyone is excited for
Man I hope we get Ed edd n Eddy so bad
I hope they are able to bring back modding too! At least make it local games only, I don’t have to do that public, but friendly mod spars are funny. 😂
Hi Tony I miss you
YEAH BABYYY
WE’RE F’N BACK!!! LET’S GO!!!
We are sooooo back
Did they add dash attacks or were those just new moves replacing old ones? 0:42 1:49
May is like so far away can’t wait
Welcome back. 😍
This has gotta be a troll right..? Hyping fans up for days on end, the McDonalds promo, and then we get a wholly uninteresting trailer full of info we mostly already knew or could readily assume “ohhh uhh the game will look better on launch!!”
One new stage? Thats it?????!!?
Let's goooo
I missed this. Can’t wait to go back to Tom & Jerry
Lets hope it works out this time
LETS GO MVS!
While I am happy that this is game is coming back, I’m just wondering. Is there a Nintendo switch version planned?
i cant lie the game sorta looked better and more stylized before the move to Unreal 5
WE'RE SO BACK
Finally ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ok but are you going to add Walter White or ben10?
I'm sad it's not until May but happy to see Multiversus again
I just hope they add Tohru from Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid to Multiversus since she's the only one who wasn't in a fighting game
Estoy jugando multiversus y soy entero bueno
Now this is epic
WE ARE SOOOO UP RN
Please bring this game to Switch it’s the only console I have and I can’t afford to buy another one or a PC :( I just want to play as the silly man Marvin
WE’RE BACK 🎉🎉🎉

2:17   What is bro talking about?

TE AMO MULTIVERSUS
YYYYY VOLVIMOS A LA NORMALIDADDDD
I’m pumped
LETSS GOOO RAHHHHH
From what we can all gather so far Multiversus is a highly anticipated fighting game that brings together iconic characters from different universes such as DC Comics, Looney Tunes, Steven Universe, and more. While the game already promises to be an exciting multiplayer experience, I believe it deserves a campaign mode for various reasons.  First and foremost, a campaign mode would add depth and context to the game. While multiplayer modes are fun and competitive, they often lack a cohesive storyline to follow. A campaign mode would provide an opportunity for players to immerse themselves in the world of Multiversus and engage with the characters on a deeper level. It would give players a chance to learn more about the characters, their backstories, and the worlds they come from, making the overall gaming experience more enriching and enjoyable.  Additionally, a campaign mode would allow for creativity and exploration within the game. Players would have the chance to navigate through different levels, complete various challenges, and unlock new content as they progress through the story. This would not only keep players engaged and motivated to continue playing, but it would also provide a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction as they overcome obstacles and defeat enemies along the way.  Furthermore, a campaign mode would cater to a wider range of players, including those who prefer solo gameplay or those who may not have access to reliable internet connections for multiplayer mode. By offering a diverse range of gameplay options, Multiversus would be able to attract and retain a larger player base, ensuring its longevity and success in the gaming industry.  Overall, adding a campaign mode to Multiversus would enhance the overall gaming experience, provide players with a more immersive and engaging storyline, and appeal to a wider range of players. It would be a valuable addition to the game that would elevate it to new heights and set it apart from other fighting games on the market. With its diverse roster of characters and unique gameplay mechanics, Multiversus truly deserves a campaign mode that would further solidify its place as a must-play title for gamers of all ages.
