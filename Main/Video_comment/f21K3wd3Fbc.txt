So happy for youuu🩷
Tell me you’re autistic, without telling me you’re autistic… it’s a great world, welcome if this is new to you.
I love that he is quiet and she is full of energy. What a harmony!
As a mom of two singles then twins, I think it's easier to have one baby at a time  and adjust then have the second and adjust than it would be to just jumping into having three right off the bat lol!!!!!
Why does Stuart look like Louis partridge to me 😂😂😂😂
I think He looks like the male version of Bella Swan from the twilight movies, late to the party but maybe Mia will see it. They could film Life and Death and Mia could play Edythe (just add some glitter) and Stuart can play Beau Swan
You’re so cute together.
It's Steve from Blues Clues! That's who Stuart looks like, with all respect and love <3
Timothee chalamet
Extremely late but he looks like drew gooden and ‘dash’ from ‘lily and dash’ 😭 i was thinking that during the whole video lool 😭  Not a bad thing cuz hes cute lol
Omg me and my husband are also gemini and pisces. hahaha

Who is ELI? Or heli i have no idea how to write it down?
HE SAID A DOVE BECAUSE IT'S A PRETTY BIRD OH MY GOD THAT'S SO SWEET I'M EMOTIONAL RN AND I'M CRYING
rewatching this video but he kind of reminded me of Marcus baker from ginny&georgia
Why are you blushing. Remember.... You are single 😅😅😅
I'm not gonna lie, I've watch your channel for a years now and I have never came across this vid, so this is so funny
Aaw, what a couple of stinkin' cutie pies. 🥧 I love him for you. 🎉 Congratulations and I hope you guys have a great wedding.

Skin tone matched 😂
He looks like he could be related to MatPat from Game Theory... Except Stewart is more fair toned.
I have found my ideal type hehe
No way that’s a heterosexual man
Mia give deer energy
WHO IS WATCHING THIS AFTER THEY GOT MARRIED ❤

The whole family is so good-looking, I’m dying
he looks like the fiance in princess diary and kind of like harry potter not gonna lie
Omg he looks like a mix of Jake Austin & Gregg sulkin. From the show wizards of waverly place 🎉!!!!
21:00 I think he looks like Robin Packalen, finnish singer!!

You guyss… there actually the perfect couple
Are they married yet I just started watching her videos
He sounds like a guy on YouTube named handler like is this him???

Mat pat is Stewart
He reminds me of Ben from Secret Life of the American Teenager!
2 years late but he looks so much like flynn rider from tangled
He really seems like a Taurus to me too
R they married?!?
OMG I just saw my own comment from 2 years ago... (I was right) :)
Late ashhhh but Stuart lowkey looks like jacob elordi especially his side profile and when he smiles
Best , a golden retriever with her black cat boy
hey.  I'm a mobile-D.J.  I'll  emcee yer DIVORCE (in-2-yrz).  Let-me-know....
WHHYYYY wld ANY-one (wit-a-'life')) care....??!!  😳 😳   🙄 🙄
not a "celebrity" but my first thought was he looks like mat pat, like the game theory youtuber.
damn, you and Stuart just lost all my respect 4 minutes into the video with your spidey answer (I'm kidding). but fr, the only right answer is Andrew.
He looks like tall and young MatPat 😂 kinda jelly
Is he related to Rainbolt?
Ok but Mias hair!!!! ❤❤❤
Lowkey he looks like shawn mendes and robert pattinson
edward cullen omggg
My boyfriend of 4 years is a Taurus. That does NOT sound like him at all. 😅 He does not value romance and our relationship probably comes #5 on his priority list and keeps moving down
I’m late to the party, but I think he looks like Jacob Elordi!
10:35 SO MIA OFTEN SAYS "memory of a peanut" AND THEN LAUGHS OMY
He looks like young David tennant
Stop this was too cute 🥰🥰
he listens to beabadoobee you won
The one question that was not asked was what does he do for a living?
Stuart talking about Mia being broken 😂 shots fired
7:42 breaking news! Sun signs are not a reliable way to determine compatibility astrologically 🎉you got get deep into the birth charts to determine that 🥰 so I’m sure you & your mom and you & Stewart have a lot of compatible placements if you dig in to astrology the way it’s meant to be used. ❤
wow...
3:06 help- he's so unseriously cute
he looks a bit like Louis partridge
omg the wy he looks at her
I cant find the stuart rates cheap wedding dresses video did it get deleted?
I know this is super late. But he looks like David Tennant!  Adorable!
I am new to your channel and all you video's pop up all the time now. I love you and your whole family are such amazing people. Your husband(now) fits you like a glove... (South Africa😉)
There are two types of zodiac signs  1. Sun sign  2. Moon sign
9:44 Wait but Canon in D? That's like the no.1 wedding music, no wonder!
XOXOXO
for astrology, moon, venus, mars and mercury synastry is more relevant in terms of compatibility! you should check his full chart he probably has lots of taurus in him
the green flags... i am weeping :)
Ferris Buhler !!!
He looks like Daniel Doheny imo
1000000% disagree with Michael Pare. Streets of fire was great and wouldn’t have been the same without him.
How people can be mean to such beautiful people>>>>>>>>
I think Stuart looks like a celebrity but idk who😂😂😂
Istg i've never smiled for 20mins straight for strangers lol you guys are so cute I can’t 😭😭😭💕
Bro looked like crispyconcords in the photo for the video. 😭😭
lucky girl he seems really nice compared to the assholes we are seeing these days
The Way he looks at you😍
lowkey Shawn Mendes
kind of look like siblings
Honestly I feel like Stuart kinda looks like Matt pat
To clear up the sodiac sign thing, even though many may not care, the sign you guys are talking about is also called your sun sign and in a horoscope, wich is basically a picture of the sky, from the second you came on this earth, a sun sign is onely one of many signs, wich makes every horoscope as unique as the person it belongs to and also the reason many people say their personality trades don't match their sodiac sign, wich is true since the sun sign is onely one of many and thus multiple different personality trades🌌💫❤
Brendon Urie from Panic at the Disco!😊
Stuart/ Stewart is the love child of Gabe Lewis from the Office and Flynn Ryder. He looks like a mix of them IMO 😂 beautiful couple
About the zodiac thing, you should look up both your birth charts and go more off that. Because your Moon and Rising signs have just as much to do with who you are as your Sun sign.
I don't know how I missed these videos before, but you guys are literally a real life fairytale couple! Looks and all. Too sweet!
I know this is old but he reminds me of a character from twilight❤❤❤
11:28 STOP IT. STOP IT NOW
He look like gabriel❤
❤️
You two are literally match made in heaven, I can't even describe how beautiful you two look together
He looks like Aladdin (animated Disney version)
Whaf? Pisces and Sagittarius are totaly compatible, their both mutable so they can get along really well
Mia, I'm a Pisces. and my Husband is a Taurus ( my 1st Husband was a Gemini). X
OMG their children are going to be PAPER WHITE!
As gemini, he definitely doesnt give gemini 😂😂😂 he's too sweet
OMG I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN HE SAID THAT TOM HOLLAND IS HIS FAV!!! I LOOOOOVE TOOOOM
Oh Stuart and I share a Birthday! The best thing about being on the cusp you get to choose which sign you are on a daily basis.
My husband isntantly thought he looks like Edward Cullen (twilight movie)
He’s definitely handsome enough to be a celebrity but nothing comes to mind. Congrats on your marriage
I know this is old, but google Henrik Thodesen - Norwegian comedian, Stewart looks so much like him!
Lol, is he québécois? I'm picking up on the accent
What a totally sweet guy…reminds me of my own sweet man. Few men deserve their women…these two guys do deserve their very real women.
I don’t know why but Stewart reminds me of a clean, good boy version of Jacob Elordi lol
Gemini and pieces are very compatible cause their twin signs 🙄😒
I don't know why but he's giving me cedric diggory mixed with Gregg Sulkin vibes
Ohhhhh, He was born May 21st. Same with me. I get along with my sister so well who is a pisces.
Stuart looks at you with so much love!
The way he looks mia oh my gosh❤
He looks like the human version of Eugene from tangled, in fact both of you look like Rapunzel and Eugene, 🥹💜💜,
Beautiful couple much blessings the sweet nature of both of u is amazing. Thanku for sharing xo
The actor Joe from the show You. Hands down. And joe is attractive. In no way do their personalities match from the show i wanna make that clear lol
2:51 this gives MAJORR ben and mal vibes from descendants, always giving such compliments like ugh GOALS 4:51 a little sass going on here
Sam Riley kinda like they could be brothers
omg...my partner and i are gemini and Pisces 😂😂😂
2 years later but Stewart looks like Mason from wizards of waverly place lmao
This is a bit late, but he looks so like the guy in the Paperman short by Disney
Andrew McCarthy from Pretty in Pink.. that is who I think Stewart resembles… this was a VERY CUTE EPISODE 🫶🏼💚🫶🏼
Carey Price!
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE A PRINCE
You’re a lovely couple! I wish you all the best & marry soon! Long engagements aren’t good.
Hey Mia if you send me both your natal chart & Stuart’s I’ll do a synastry reading for you guys. Just make sure you have the exact time of birth on the charts.
calling a girl sweet = stupid
an older guy with a younger girl. so original.
mama maples has the best laugh
Tobey Maguire he’s the best Spider-Man he’s the OG❤
He just looks famous
toby is #1!!!
he looks like a really young Bob Saget
Andrew G!
The entire time I watched this I was thinking that Stewart looks like a young Bob Saget!
I feel like hearing Stuart say that you talking to a camera is cool and not weird really healed something inside my soul 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
I’m saying this out of love but actually I have noticed that you seem to be clinging on to physical ailments and using negative ways to describe your physical state of being. You are extremely healthy, strong and youthful, vibrant and full of life! Please think again and shift yourself into a new mindset ❤ ya know what would be so fun is if you and your family went to one of those outdoor climbing teamwork building places because girl you’re literally an athlete you are a definition of physical strength im serious 😊😊😊 I don’t even have money to go to the chiropractor and I’m working 6/7 days a week for ten plus hour shifts, like trust me you are doing great!!! I’m still in disbelief of your skating capabilities from that one video.
They're so cute together my heart😭😭
Stuart seems genuine and he’s cute! You look like a great couple!
OMG A LOFI LOVERRRR❤❤❤❤❤
Can we PLEASE have more videos with Stuart? we haven’t seen him since the wedding and that’s a TRAVESTY
he looks like fliyn rider from repunzill
Stuart looks so much like matpat from gametheory its actually crazy
HE LOOKS LIKE MATPAT  a big late now but that’s who he looks like :)
Omg he’s so scared
3:23 Tom Holland is definitely the best Spider-Man imo, followed by Andrew Garfield.  The Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films are fun, but Tobey's Peter Parker was too awkward/ cringey for my liking. I know a lot of fans thought Andrew Garfield's version was too cool for Peter Parker but I personally loved it - he was cool, goofy & full of quips. Tom Holland's version is the perfect balance tho imo.
I think Stewart looks like Matt Patt honestly haha.
Hello Stuart. Lots of love to you both.
You two are so cute, you look great together.💖
Your parents gave you good self-esteem. I have acute hearing and don't like it when you yell or get loud blurting things out. If you could stop doing that, I'd appreciate it.
I think she would be a gazelle ❤❤
I'm sure this has already been mentioned but for zodiacs, you need to look at more than just the sun signs, moon (emotions), Venus (relationships), and Mercury (communication),  and much more need to be looked at in a synastry chart.
Penn badgley
5:32 you had the perfect opportunity to say "if you're a bird I'm a bird"
Good Doctor and Bates motel actor Freddie Highmore, is that you???? Omg you guys are so adorable
I think Stewart looks like Harry Potter and I mean that in the best way possible
OMG I totally saw Stuart as a couple of actors but I cannot remember where from! Wait...let me google........oh, ok one of them is a young Brendan Hines but the other one I just can't remember aaaargh!!!
Mia does give off dove energy
Lol... You two are really a great couple... Stuart looks like a very very young Bob Saget from Full House. ❤
IS IT JUST ME THAT BELIEVES THERE IS PROBABLY NO ONE MORE PERFECT FOR MIA THAN HIM? THEY ARE SOOO BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER OMG! ❤
You guys are so cute!! 🥰🥰🥰
He looks like Louis Patridge!!
I see a resemblance with Robert Pattinson
I know this may sound weird but I see a young Christian bale in him .. for some reason I see it and now I can unsee it! Love you Mia! I’m late again.. at least I’m here now haha
Can we clone him? I want one.
You are too cute together to look at, AAAA <3
You guys are so adorable together.❤🙏 Congratulations on the engagement.❤🙏🎉 And also congratulations on your guys's wedding.❤🙏🎉 May God Bless You.❤🙏 Amen.❤🙏
I watched the wedding vlog before i watched this video and i always thought u gave off Louis partridge vibes like fr !! To the outfit choice to the cute ,awkward,calm personality!! Plus the side profile looks so much like him
Bob Saget
He is straight out of a fairytale 🥺💟❤️🌻✨
Don't ask me how I know but Mia's now husband looks like p.0.r.n actor Ryan Driller😅
He's like young Edmund from Narnia:3

Twilight Robert Pattinson
Robert Pattinson
I'm thinking a little younger Toby McGuire
10/10 would recommend where did you find this man.He didn't disappoint
Looks like matpat
The fiancé is fine AF 👀
He looks like a prince of a Disney movie,and I have to say it..Your 3kids are gonna be soooo white 😅 I’m that white and I couldn’t notice 😅
Gemini and Sagittarius are almost twins and you are raced by a sagie maybe that’s how you are so good for each other
I think he looks like David Tenant 🧡
Team Edward!!
HE LOOKS LIKE FELIX MALLARD
Omg I’m in the Taurus Gemini cusp!! May 21!!! 🎉
I know this video is old but, you asked if Stuart looks like anyone, and immediately when I first saw him I thought he looks like MatPat from Game Theory! 😄
Ok sorry not sorry but Stuart really looks like Tewkesbury from Enola Holmes
Flynn Ryder and rapunzel legit
Stuart definitely gives major golden retriever vibes!! 😭✨
Okay but me and my BEST FRIEND/SOULMATE, are Gemini (me) and Pisces (them). Best zodiac combo ever 🤌✨ You guys are so good together!! 💛
how old are you?  how old is stuart ? you are both adorable together. also what happened to your back ?
Send me your birthdays and I’ll do your charts.  It’s not the sun conjunct as much as all the other planets!
Your sun sign is one thing but….you need to know your ascendant and moon.  Makes a big difference 😉
My fiance is Pisces and I am Gemini! lol
As far as dopplegangers go, he reminds me a lot of MatPat
You guys are so adorable! And I dunno! Soon as you asked if Stuart looked like any celebrity, I immediately thought "OMG he kinda looks like MatPat!"
you two are adorable! mia, you found a gem :)
The chemistry and love between y’all is undeniably amazing!!! It really shows which is beautiful!!!❤
He looks like MatPat crossed with Drew Gooden!
I hope there are more videos of you two together! I love getting to know YouTubers!
you guys are adorable couple goals 4 sure
Just from the start you remind me of Anne and Gilbert
I’d love a new Q&A now that you’ve been married for a little bit!
Between you two, & Taylor & Sophia ❤
I'm shocked that nobody mentioned that he looks like MatPat when you asked if he looks like any celebrity. I feel like they are so similar
penn badgley 100%
He kinda looks like Stuart little
You two are gonna have really white kids (as in really pale white) please cover them in sun block cream AND spray……and maybe a hat…. cause now I’m nervous for these non-existent kids. 😝
not gonna lie he looks like flin rider (and tht ia a good thing)
they are so cute
2000's Peter Parker for sure
Timothy Chalomet  (I don’t think that is how you spell it) he looks exactly like him! Anyways, congratulations, you guys are so great together!!
David Copperfield (the famous magician)  🎩😄
8:45 Yes!! I don't like the food juices because they run into the other foods and change the tastes and ugh! I cant stand it!! Lol😂❤
As a Taurus, I see more Taurus in him than Gemini.😂 You guys are so cute!!❤
He's a delight! So complimentary.
He is like a cross between Andrew Garfield & Robert Patterson :) Its lovely how you two get along you can see how much you love each other xx
He’s adorable! Congratulations on the engagement🎉❤
They're so cute! does anyone know if they're still together?
omg he looks very much like Louis Partridge aka "Tewkesbury the main actor from Enola holmes"!
Lol since he’s on the cusp of Taurus it makes sense cause I’m a Leo but I’m on the cusp of cancer which explains the emotional side of me😂 but I would honestly prefer a Gemini over a Taurus any day and I’ve experienced a couple Tauruses while my first love was a Gemini lol
Omg yess nobody else says tobey bc they’re all babies lol I kinda stopped watching when Andrew was Spider-Man and people just thought he was better bc he made for a hot nerd but to me he wasn’t realistic, just had a sad story (esp with Gwen) and only two movies unfortunately I mean I love Andrew and Emma but Tom Holland was def my second fav along with zendaya, they’re too cute and Tom was honestly made for that role, also impressive how he could do most of his stunts on his own (fun fact: the actors for Peter and MJ aren’t allowed to date due to professionalism but all three of em did🤣 and Tomdaya is still going strong 😌 fav couple, but Tobey is still my fav Spider-Man with the best villains (Dr. Octopus being my fav, sequel was the best one let’s be real lol)
Mia! Maybe your MOON SiGN IS IN GEMINI and that is why you’re compatible with him! Cuz humans aren’t just their ‘sun’ sign only we have depth so all of us have many placements in our natal chart that make up who or what we are. So your star sign is actually irrelevant. Back in the day like in newspaper times they used ppls sun sign to make astrology popular cause it’s the easiest to figure out .❤
NATE JACOBS
❤️
I bought a crystal named mia
When a dog loves a guy, they surely must be a decent human being❤
My dad and my sister have the same Zodiac sign as you
Andy Samberg!!!
Not sure why, but if anyone remembers Mike from when FleurDForce first introduced him.. Stuart reminds me of him.
Watching a Pisces Gemini makes me happy
I think he kind of looks like Joe from You?
This isn’t relevant but I keep thinking about the pronunciation of itadori😭😂 you tried your best lol
What’s y’all’s big 3? lol maybe that’s why he seems more of a taurus
MatPat is a celeb I guess.. and your fiance (now husband) really looks like him a lot.
the actor who was Jack McPhee on Dawson's Creek!
he seems wonderful, congratulations!
❤❤❤
Does Stewart look like MattPat to yall??  New to Mia's channel and playing catch up-funny because I'm in Ontario!   Love the channel ❤️
what in the world, its been over a year since this ????? wowowow
Only me who noticed the hickey on Stewart's neck😂... Anywayss congratulations on the wedding❤
He looks like a young Joseph Fiennes
You guys are so cute together! Love that. Also, I’m dying at how he kept dragging your back 😂😂 & he gives me Edward from Twilight vibes minus the super pale and creepiness lol.
Kids, it’s normal to be annoyed and irritated by your partner. The thing is choosing to be together and loving each other past that.
3 kids is a perfect number!
3:20 honestly I was a bit sad bc my boyfriend and 90% of my friends hated Spiderman No Way Home and are very close minded on that subject and I wanted to talk about No Way Home that way with someone, I really wanted to jump inside my phone and talk about it with you guys haha
I'm a year late but I'm watching all of your videos atm! He reminds me of a mix of Pete Davidson and Andrew garfield maybe?
He is everything I imagined he would be.
For me, I would have to say that he kinda of looks like Christian Coulson from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
I really like him.  He reminds me of the late Bob Saget.  I hope you know who that was.  You two are adorable together, Mia.
I don’t know if anyone else sees some resemblance but I think he sorta looks like Louis Partridge however it might just be me though! Congrats on your engagement! You are perfect for each other! ❤
Haha I think Us Geminis get a bad wrap 🤣
He looks great to me! 🤭
Im gemini too
Young Rob Lowe
you guys are so beautiful together
20:49 ; late to this but def jacob elordi and andrew garfield obvs in the best way possible
How old are they?
WAITTTT OMG I JUST REALIZED WHO STEWART LOOKS LIKEEE!!!! he looks JUST LIKE Louis Patridge!!!
hessss fineee
They seem really incompatible.  He seems very low energy maybe nervous.    He liked him for his height.
Since you asked, Stuart looks just like MattPat and I can’t see anything else
He gives me Tom holland vibes lol. You guys are F’n adorable
I think he looks a lot like Shawn Mendez
edward cullen vibes
rapunzel and flynn vibes 😭❤️
I love foxES
I think Stuart looks a lot like Gregg Sulkin from Disney channel.
You are so perfect for each other but you are soooo young.
he looks a bit like Dave Franco and Louis Partridge... and some other actor i cant remember.
Looooooooove ❤️
is it just me or the song from mia s wrapped sounded like the uwma ost..!!
You’re right! Zodiac signs are definitely not always right. I stopped believing in all that crap when I had a daughter on 9/30/07, and then a second daughter on 9/30/10….three years (exactly) and a few hours apart, and they couldn’t be more different!!! Nothing alike, even though they have the same parents and the same birthday!!!
I'm waiting for the video of you guys baking together 😍
He's a literal walking green flag!!
He looks like a dreamy lost member of Echo & the Bunnymen. 😁🥰
He gives Edward Cullen vibes😂
I love how the Spotify wrapped is so similar to mine. I have lists on Spotify with rock, metal, country,  classical, pop, etc 😂 "so much range "
Wow!  Your fiance is sooooo nice!  He seams like a great person!
Yall look like the couple from tangled
The way he looks at you is so so sweet! I'm so excited for y'all!
He looks like the son from Breaking Bad. RJ Mitte. That’s all I can picture when I see him.
a very good content
Nice hair 😍
Wow
Now I want to see photos of high school Mia with curly hair and glasses haha THIS IS SO CUTE
Wonderful
Okk
If you get deeper into astrology, you realize that only the Sun sign tells you almost nothing. It's the whole natal chart that can give you some clarity on a person's personality and behaviours, and we also must not forget about the environment, culture, people, situations, opportunities, etc., people grew up in and how the individual perceived and received all of it. All of that shapes us. Even twins, that are born from the same egg, on the same day, almost the same hour and minute & the same environments, are different individuals.  I would say the most important signs to check for relationship compatibility are signs in Ascendant (you need to know the hour of birth to get this one), Venus, Mars and also Moon. If you are interested, I suggest checking compatibility of your whole natal charts. But, of course, nothing is set in stone. I personally use astrology more for better understanding of myself and others rather than something that is set in stone and that's how it is. I like to learn about something that I maybe don't really see yet in myself. The sooner the better. I don't like to dismiss anything, but I also question everything. And do some deep diving and thinking.  It's also really fun to do it together with someone. So you can think about stuff you might never think about and you talk to each other about what it says and how much it actually applies to either of you. And get to know yourselves and each other better. No matter how much we think we know ourselves, there's always something more to learn.  I also like to check, for example, Chinese horoscope which gives you another perspective & if you combine the characteristics of each horoscope (in your sign), you can get even more wholesome picture of, well, yourself.  Ooo, and my Sun sign is also Gemini on the cusp of Taurus & I must say I realized there's a little bit of Taurus in me a long time ago (but I don't have Taurus anywhere in my chart - except the proximity in my Sun sign). Horoscopes aside, I think you are beautiful people (inside and out) and are awesome together! Your whole wedding and all the speeches were like in a fairy-tale - just...magical. Congratulations & I wish you both a lifetime of love, respect and support. Bless you 💜
Beautiful
💝💝💝
Stuart looks like Olivia Rodrigo ONE HUNDRED PERCENT
Hey Mia, I know that you're probably not going to see this but,  I love you so much, you are so beautiful and funny. Your videos make me so happy and anytime I watch them, my mom looks at me like "Who are texting?!" because I just get a huge smile on my face. I can't even describe how much I love your videos (Ex. It's 4am as I'm writing this, and I've been watching your vids since 5pm)   To whoever is reading this right now, I hope you have an amazing day. (P.S. Mia I know that you got married this month and I hope your marriage will be as amazing and fun as we all know it will be)
He kinda looks like Dylan Riley Snyder and Willem Dafoe mashed in together
AHHHHGOING BACK THROUGH ALL THESE VIDS AFTER WATCHING THE WEDDING VID IM SO FREAKING HAPPY FOR YOU TOO! (T-T) <3
Watching this right after the wedding 😭😭😭
The thing about him making your mom a necklace with one of the diamonds melted my heart, so sweet. Wishing a fabulous lifelong love to you two.
Stuart for sure looks like MatPat from Game Theory! Thought it as soon as I saw him
HE'S THE CUTER AND WHITE VERSION OF MASSIMO FROM 265 DAYS SHUT UP😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤚
this was a joy
Lovely
Good
Mia don’t forget you wanted fringe on your wedding dress.
Beautiful. Congratulations. xo
This is who I thought Stuart was. Howdy, Dude!
Hello 👋 your a lovely couple 💑 ♥ he's so handsome MIA and your so pretty WHEN DID YOU MEET EACH OTHER  ?
sooooo cute, both of you. 😉😉😉😉
Oh my gosh, I'm just now getting back to watching youtube, I have watched so many of your tubes. it's like I am on a Mia Marathon..I think you did so well meeting Stewart, He is so sweet, polite loving, and just the best guy ever. what a lucky gal and guy you are for meeting each other. I love you both. Oh, he looks a little like Johnny Depp and his eyes are like John Travolta. Yummy
He’s VERY handsome! I’m thinking he kind of looks like Anne Hathaway’s brother…?
Stuart reminds me of Penn Badgley from ‘You’!
Also omg I love your guys relationship, your guys are sooooo cuuuuuutteee☺️☺️☺️🙏🙏🙏😭😭😭😭🤗🤗🤗
Omg he looks like MatPat from game/film/food theory
He lookes like spider man kind of...
Hi Mia you and Stuart make such a cute couple you compliment each other so well I'm so happy for you both best wishes
I'm late, but I think Steward looks like David Tennant and Peter Capaldi combined
You guys are sooooo cute... made for each other...
Shawn mendez
Heck yes Mia girl I agree I have always shot my shot and more often then not it works out in one way haha
Stuart is definitely Flynn Rider
You guys will make such cute babies!!!
Ok first of all, you two are definitely made for each other, so cute together!  So you asked if we thought Stuart resembled any celebrity and Henry Cavill immediately popped in my mind!
Also for the kid thing you forget about the pain almost instantly it is the strangest phenomena.
Everyone who dates a Gemini….. he is so not a Gemini lol 😂😂😂😂
you two are electric together.  should totally do a return ox with him
Oh no, for me it ruins everything when I like someone. If I'm fairly close to them, I wouldn't ever tell them because I wouldn't want them to be uncomfortable with me around. I wouldn't want to ruin what we already have. If I feel like they're distancing themselves from me, I always assume it's because they know and are uncomfortable and I distance myself from them even further. Boi didn't reply to me, I am never texting him again. I feel ignored when we're out, I am gonna start avoiding him. Cause the last thing I wanna do, is make them uncomfortable.  But tbf, the few times that someone I liked actually showed interest in me... I kinda freaked out and lost interest immediately lol. I honestly think I do just want a best friend. And something about them not liking me back is safe. I do kinda think I pick out the people that have no interest in me, but do enjoy my company.  Gotta love how I turn every commentsection into a therapy session for me
He doesn’t “look” like him but he has the voice & mannerisms of Mark Ruffalo
Cute couple, but he is so beautiful!! She is funny and sweet, I said that before, but he is gorgeous!!!
Congrats Stewart and Mia! 🌷🌷🌷
You can also dry vegetables with a napkin before salting it and it can help with wet water weirdness on vegetables.
Barty*
He kinda looks similar to the guy on Harry Potter that took the polyjuice potion to become professor moody I think his name was Barry crouch
He looks like Gregg Sulkin from wizards of waverly
❤❤
He looks like an actor, but i dont know who. Its a guy in a teenager movie.
Cake no 1 and nö.2 they.look
Congrats!
I'm guessing you had a crush on Michael from princess diaries... 😊
Stuart = mellow Matpat
He looks like Dan from Full House
Congratulations for the weeding,  l'm very happy  for  you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think he looks like bob saget in his 20s and congratulations  on the engagement you guys are perfect for each other 🎉🥳🎊
He looks like an adult version of Louis Patrige.
It's funny that you asked about his celebrity doppelganger because from the first second of this video I was trying to place it the whole time of who he looks like to me haha And I realize it's Herman Tømmeraas who plays "Fjor" in Ragnarok on Netflix!
i think you are so funny
so he was the same guy that helped you with your parents room makeover? idk just saw him slightly in the mirror
I think he looks a little like Ian Harding from PLL :D
He is a male version of Anne Hathaway. 🤭🤭🤭
aaaa i’m so late but i’m so happy for you mia!
OMG miaa.. I am a gemini and my husband is pisces. And i'm with him since high school which is 13 years. And i knew him since elementary, 20 years!! Zodiac compatible is hoax! Wkwkwkwk
He looks like an older version of the guy from stranger things... the guy who gets lost in S1
So happy for you! Congratulations!!! ❤️❤️❤️
🐼 Big Bear Hugs from a 68 yr old grandma in Kirby, Texas, USA 🐼 ❤ 🎀 ❤ 🎀 ❤ 🎀
Omg He reminds me of sweet Victor Van Dort. You guys would do an amazing Corpse bride couple costume! Hehehe
He’s cute :) happy for you! Also Andrew Garfield vibes.
Was hoping to hear more answers or substance :/
for the celeb look alike question: I thought it was Matpat for a split second at the beginning of the video
Bir şey diyim mi bu adam mükemmel
Omgggg he's so cuteeee. Congratsss 🎉🎉
Dude I love him. I just came back to this after the dress try on video. & you guys just go together. It’s crazy❤️
He resembles the late Bob Saget.  Miss him so much…. R.I.P. BOB💞🌺🌻💔
He kinda looks like a mix of 3 spideemans😂
I think he looks like Andrew Garfield!
He somewhat looked like MatPat from Film Theory
He looks like Andrew Garfield! He loves you so much and it's adorable💖💖
you guys are soo cute together!! Stuart seems like the sweetest guy ever can't wait to see him in more vids :D and I couldn't place who he looked like until the end when you asked but he's def giving Jacob elordi to me now hahaha
He’s adorable!
I love the humor you have together 💛
he looks so familiar but i just cant place it
Toby is definitely best spider man
They are so cute. Stewart seems like he should have a British accent is that just me lol
OMG I JUST REALIZED STUART AND I HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY
I get a Tom Cruise vibe from his looks. I think it's the eyebrows and kind of the hair.
He’s adorable 🥰- you both are. Very happy for both of you.
Gives me Edward Cullen vibes ngl.. 🔥
So I'm putting this all together and it sounds like Mama Maples gave BOTH of the diamonds she found from her old ring to Stuart for Mia's ring and he turned around and made ONE into a ring for Mia and the OTHER into a necklace for Mama and oh my heart that is just the sweetest 😭
It's been a hot minute since I've caught up with your videos and got pulled in by the "pregnant" video then discovered you were engaged and had to catch up and IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!! I've been following you for a while now and you are honestly my favorite YouTuber, it's so good to see you so happy!! I wish you two the best, most fulfilling and happy lives together!🥰❤️❤️❤️
You guys look like you would be the main characters of a wholesome romance book! <3
Ks Estrada from Philippines, he doesn't look like him but i feel like he has the same mannerism
Is it just me or he kinda looks like MatPat from the Game Theory??
This is adorable, so happy for you Mia! He's great. Also, he sort of reminds me of Penn Badgley!
Hes just like mama maples attitude wise. Both of their smiles are contagious❤❤ and he looks at Mia just like Mama maples does
He’s so sweet!! The perfect man!! You both are incredible people and you’re perfect for eachother, I just know it:) He landed a good one, and you landed a good one :))) I hope your wedding is everything you both could ever dream of!!❤️
You guys are adorable 😭😭😭
I know I'm a bit late to the doppelganger party, but he makes me think of Tyson Ritter, the singer of All American Rejects. Circa early 2000s. Congrats, guys!! 😊
He looks like a Canadian version of matpat
He looks like Jacob Elordi!!
He seems so nice and genuine and like he really loves you!!! I’m so happy we finally got to meet him :)
He reminds me of a main character out of a John Green book. Adorable couple!!
Congrats. You both look so cute together! He seems to look at you with a lot of love❤️
gentle as water
no but he does look like a taurus D: i need a chart lmao  this was adorable!!
He kinda looks like Penn Badgley, I think it's the smile. Anyways, he is adorable and you guys look so cute together!
I dont think I've ever seen a negative comment on this channel!
Aww this was so cute!  I have been off YouTube for most of the last year or so. Finally catching up on some thing and this was so awesome to see! Congratulations to you both!  🎊 🎉
A mix of young Brendan Fraser and Jacob elordi
You guys are so cute 🥰 haha might just be me but my first thought Andrew garfeild or Tom Holland maybe Stuart’s just the next Spider-Man 😮😃
He's a mixture of Andrew Garfield and Ryan Reynolds. The video was great and loved it. Mama Maples reaction was epic lol
Her fiance is handsome.
Congratulations Mia ! Also he kinda looks like Gregg Sulkin. Not a lot but there’s a vibe lol. So happy for you both ! 🤍
my husband is a Taurus and I'm an Aquarius.  It is literally the WORST zodiac signs you can put together.  We've been married for 16 years I started dating him in 1998 and we are literally BEST FRIENDS.  I think sometimes the differences in people, how they think, how they act....how they react can be (if you are open to it) really big teachable moments in life.  We learn so much from each other.  If at the very foundation you have trust, respect and honesty you have a pretty solid start.  My grandma said something to me that probably was the saving grace with this specific relationship.  She said "Part of loving someone, really loving them, is to honor their free will"  and it's so true.  If you encourage your partner that it is okay to be an individual first and take care of their needs too, to not.. sacrifice their wants and needs for the sake of the relationship both people at the end of the day are happy and fufilled.  Congrats Mia.
HIIIIII
I CANT STOP GETTING BUTTERFLIES JUST WATCHING YOU GUYS❤️
I love him so much 😭 exactly as I’d imagined for you. Such a genuine sweet guy ❤️
Try looking up your fiancé's "sidereal" (as opposed to tropical) birth chart. He might actually be a taurus 😊
Mia would be a squirrel, squirrelling away diy material haha
He Looks so much like Greg Sulkin!! Also congratulations on your engagement 🥺
Tom Cruz!  Stuart is much nicer though!  Love you guys and wish you the very best!  ❤️ from Minnesota
him" this isn't risky enough." I have an extra button undone." 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He looks like MatPat a lot, I think?
🥂So happy for you Mia!
Cannot get enough of this episode!! Love the chemistry between you two and congratulations 🎉
Okay u guys are cute but Mia handing the water and saying “here I am being sweet” killed me
Pretty sure the purpose of the wedding is to see the dress
Stuart like "Stuart Little"
HIS SIDE PERSON LOOKS LIKE MATPAT….
Stuart's celebrety doppelganger: David Tennant
This video is absolutely adorable. Stuart looks exactly like John Bubniak. I legitimately cannot unsee the resemblance. John Bubniak played Spider-Man in the Spider-Man PS4 game.
He reminds me of Robert Sean Leonard (Neil from Dead Poets Society) and also he's so sweet, like Gilbert Blythe!
Joe Goldberg, ahahahahah.
Something has changed with Mia and she is looking extra extra extra beautiful.🥰🔥❤️ congratulations you 2 .
Cedric Diggory 🤔
I'm so obsessed with you guy's , he's a keeper Mia.  Also he gives me Andrew Garfield vibes, like down to earth and fun. And yeah, heyy Stewart you did so great and you both are match made in heaven , we love you.
you two are so cute omg
I’ve never heard a fiance saying “that’s not the wedding’s purpose” when asked about the dress AND IT’S SO CUTE love that for mia
okay I know this was so long ago but I really think Stewart looks like Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield mixed together  you guys are really adorable and I'm so happy for you 😭
you guys are so cute omg
This might sound random but he looks alot Like mat pat from game theory in my opinion
Stewart makes me think of matpat from film/game/food theory channels
I heard the word doppelganger and came straight to the comments!! I see a mix between Carlos sainz and timothee chalamet personally!
i think stuart looks like bob saget when he was jounger in full house
💖👑👑💖you make a beautiful cute couple and i feel you both will be married only once to each other for sure 💖😊💖xxx
Your fiance looks like Ian Harding
He looks like matpat
just now realizing how similar my relationship is to y’all’s. so happy for y’all!!!
You both are so cute. And he reminds me of a very young David Tennant.  P.S. I wrote this comment before watching the whole video, I had no idea Mia was gonna ask which celebrity he looks like. Lol.
I would of totally 💯 without a single doubt guessed that he was a Taurus ♉
Is it just me or does he look exactly like Walter Jr from Breaking bad 🤣❤️❤️
He looks like David Tennant!!! They are identical!!! Look it up!!
You’re so cute together, i can see why you want to get married. But have you ever heard that your fiancée looks a lot like matpat? Still different but very similar
He looks like Jacob Elordi!!!! lol Congrats to you both! You seem great together <3
Andrew Garfield & RJ Mitte vibes !! :)
Mashallah, also this was posted on my birthday oop
He actually did remind me of a celebrity when I 1st heard him speak of the guy from twilight Edward the vampire I don't know his name
He has a really great personality and well spoken
Timothee chalamet
Y'all are adorable! In terms of who he looks like... ok, so there's someone who's name I literally can not think of, but the closest I can get to them is like if the two youtubers MatPat and Finn Harries had a lovechild. lol But also, I feel like Stuart looks like he should have a British accent. 😄
I’d say his closest celebrity lookalike in my eyes would be Gregg Sulkin. Not an exact doppelgänger, but the overall look and vibe for some reason. So happy for you both!
Babes pull up your birth charts that might be why his sun sign doesn’t fit his personality
“I have an extra button undone” 😂😂❤️
You should do a Wish Wedding Decor Haul!
Based on looks and his outfit choice, he reminds a lot of Penn Badgley!
By the way, your honey is as adorable as you are.
Regarding  zodiacs you have to go by your whole chart.  This sun signs compatibility is not all that zodiac compatibility entails.  What about your moon signs etc, etc, etc.  Similiar to what you look like is not necessarily the just the sign sun.  It also has to do with your rising sign.  Much that has do with your zodiac in newspapers and online is just entertainment.  Get charts done and have someone read the blueprints of who you are.
I love how he looks at you Mia  you can totally see the love 💕💕 Congratulations to you both
The way you two play off each other is so cute. 💜 Thank you for doing this video Stewart.
u're Evil..I know how difficult for a shy person to be on camera (as the social beast that you (Mia) are, you can never relate ) ..I just hope that what you  promised him in return is worth it 😂😂😂😂...
Your loverman looks like a younger Lukas Haas for certain. P.S. You guys are so adorable!! I am so happy for yall. <3
Zucchini cut in put them on paper towels and salt then let sweat
I feel like he looks a bit like Penn Badgley mixed with Andrew Garfield vibes as well! Haha
he looks like chip lol but in the best way possible (from beauty and the beast)
I - T----A -D- A -O- R -I....! I CAN'T😭😭☠️
WE LOVE TAYCE
You are a match made in heaven!!! I wish you luck!!!  PS- He looks alot like timothee chalamet😁
"it depends on the birthing" is the most hilarious thing I've ever heard but honestly so true
I like him a lot!  I think he looks like Nicky Farina (now), in the face.  I don't think Mia understood what Stuart meant about annoying things.  He said "I'm annoyed by the things that Mia had to go thru in her life that annoy her, like her back injury."   He does not like the fact that you have to suffer pain and always have to do chiropractic care cuz it hurts you. That was a very loving and caring thing to feel.    Mia: please listen more intently to his answers.  You jumped on him so fast, for no reason! Put your phone down and listen... ijs.  He's a keeper.
I literally though of Stuart little right when she said his name was Stuart lol
I love him for you
Why wasn’t the most obvious question asked?   I would have liked to know how long you’ve been together…
You're too perfect together. Congratulations and all the best ❤️
He looks SO MUCH like Zak Henri from Blended, like to a T This was hands down my fave video, they have the cutest relationship I've ever seen 😭
He looks like Johnny Depp mixed with Timothée Chalamét to me!
If he was a little more tan he would look exactly like Flynn rider from Tangled
hello Stewrat, fello Gemini. nice to meet ya :)
Your fiancé looks like young Rupert Everett
Is it just me or does he kinda very much kinda look like mat pat
I think Stuart looks like a slightly younger version of Mike deForce (YouTuber Fleur deForce's husband).  He's lovely as well!
This made me so happy to see!! You 2 are awesome together 🥰
Rapunzel and Flynn in one frame😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
He looks like mat pat
congrats on the engagement i have been watching you for years super happy for you! Also he lowkey looks like andrew garfield
When he was walking in from the side profile he kinda looked like MatPat and I was so shooook 🤭🤭🤭
Stuart low-key reminds me of Ezra from pretty little liars
He is so nervous 😂😂😂
Congrats. I see Bob Saget.
He’s definitely a Gemini 😭 but in all the good ways!! Us Geminis either take 50% (either the best traits or the sucky ones) or 100% bipolar mix😭😭
MIA We have the same popsocket!!!
I’m getting Robert Pattinson vibes from him
A little bit like Andrew Garfield xx
I don't if its just the angles but Stuart looks a little like matpat from Film Theory/Food Theory/etc
She has a Fiancé
Was literally smiling ear to ear for this entire video. So happy for you guys!!!
I'm glad you asked, as soon as I saw Stuart's side profile, I immediately thought of MatPat. Now he may not be a super famous celebrity, but yeah, from the side for sure looks like MatPat :D
At the end of the video you mentioned if your Fiance looked like any celebs and i think from his side profile he looks a little like Louis Partridge from Enola Holmes. Also i am so so happy for you both on your engagement you are perfect for each other xx
He’s adorable! You two look so cute together❤️
I see similarities with Andrew Garfield. Congrats
Hi Stewart!
he reminds me of bob segat a little
Stewart looks like a young Bob Saget but more handsome.
He is soooo cute his smile is mesmerizing and both of you make such a wonderful couple. I would say it's a match really made in heaven. You guys are perfect. May God bless you both always. Loads of love and best wishes for you

Stewart!!!! I love him !
He has great eyebrows!
LITERALLLLLL PRINCE CHARMING, he looks like the type of italian model that features on those blue water hugo boss ads. SUCH A CUTE COUPLE.
I think he looks like a paler Ryan McCartan as JD from Heathers the Musical
He's so adorable they are so adorable together.. 🤭 and am I the only one who thinks he resembles Stuart Little😂😂
IT...adori_yuji, clearly you don't watch anime
Personally I think he kind of has a resemblance to The Darkling (General Kirigan), played by Ben Barnes from "Shadow And Bone". At first when I saw him that's what I thought of but, at a closer look I'm not quite sure. One thing I can say for sure, is that you both seem very happy together and I wish you both the best!! 💗😊
I feel like a young bob saget
you r guys so cute couple :) stuart r definitely looks like Robert Pattinson from Twilight  LOL :)
i feel like with the pale skin and everything he looks like edward cullen
He is very cute and handsome! He gives off really good vibes! Genuinely sweet like our Mia!
:) my fiancé is also Stuart:) very old fashion name:)
Did I imagine it or didn’t she have a boyfriend in some videos? Is this the same guy?
As a Taurus I'm now convinced that we would be great friends then 😂 I am very similar to Stewart's personality
Yesss he looks like GREG SULKIN FROM WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE!
HE LOOKS LIKE NATE FROM EUPHORIA OMG
Nice to see you
AHHH
Aww barely watching this..you guys remind me of Rapunzel and Flynn a little so cute 😂🏰 happy for you Mia 💗
he looks at Mia with the warmest gaze 😊
I give him praise I can't even get over the nerves enough to finish my channel lol
"I have an extra button undone" got me laughing so bad lol
He look like Jacob elordi for kissing booth
Congratulations Mia!! He looks like Tom Holland!💎
I see a mild resemblance to Fleur de Force’s husband, Mike. Not exactly a celebrity, but known by some!
Can you make a video on how to edit hauls ? 😭 I’m trying to make a YouTube channel and have no clue on how to edit nor record 😂 I love you btw ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
According to mine and my hubbys zodiac signs we should hate each other lol. We are both the most laid back partners ever! Don’t think we’ve had one argument in 13 years of being together. It’s just easy x
I always think Mia would be a caffeinated squirrel or meerkat or something equally as cute small and fast lol x
I love how he almost never looks at the camera and looks lovingly into your face the majority of the time 🥺🥺
He reminds me of Edward from twilight !!!
He def looks like Shawn Mendes
I also made my bf watch RuPaul's Drag Race with me and now he's obsessed hahaha our dates are like: ok, so RuPaul and take out and I LOVE IT
I love that he looks at you the entire video. Like you can just see how much he's in love with you.
Congratulations to you both!!! Wishing you the most amazing longest happy marriage! It's also true for me you guys make our hearts smile I could not wipe the smile off my face watching!! 😊❤
He is so sweet! I'm happy for both of you! you look happy and in love 😄🥰
So cute! I can totally see him interacting with everyone in the family. Doppelganger wise, he reminds me of Andrew Gardfield. Definitely not a doppelganger but reminds me of him for sure
I really loved his sense of humour and the two of them are just a perfect match! Wishing all the happy to the two of you! (And thanks Stuart for deciding to show yourself to us!)
Guys, hear me out. He's like Victor from Corpse Bride, and I mean that in the best possible way.
reminds me of ian harding
Dr.who
HE LOOKS LIKE FLYNN RIDER FROM TANGLED
He looks like he could cosplay as Flynn Ryder. Oooorr just a paler version of Joe from Netflixs' You.
Oh I am so behind on the Mia videos! This was just so wonderful to watch! You could see in his eyes how much he is just completely head over heels for you and he is so adorable,  just like Mia.   They are couple goals for sure!  Welcome to YouTube Stewart!
Awww you guys look so cute together🥺❤️So happy for you
I think Stuart could be the best Peter Parker. You guys are so adorable!
Matpat???😂😂 jk congratulations
Awhhhhhhhhh, beautiful 💗
This was so beautiful 🥺, omggg so refreshing and precious.
All I listen to is Lofi too!!! I looveeee Lofi music
🗣BE A TAURUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  Also I almost screamed (I’m at work) when he said your body is annoying. My husband is the same way. He says I am broken LMFAOOO! I have a bad back, I’m blind 😂, I have bad knees, I have asthma & terrible sinus issues lol just everything is wrong with me
Google told me that they were in a open relationship
10/10 to this man, gold stars all around. I wish you both the very best! (he would slightly blush when he looked at you and that warmed my heart)
Awwwwww
I’m a CancerLeo Cusper and my husband is a solid Gemini it just works somehow 😂 I love our love even though the zodiacs aren’t completely in our favor it works. Congratulations Mia I love him for you ❤️
People who say ur not funny when you think you are funny yourself are wrong… I mean ITS YOUR OWN HUMOUR.. why wouldn’t you think it’s funny…?? That’s just weird I think
It. Adori. Yuji. My poor Itadori Yuji 😂😂😂
They look so cute omg!
Mia!! I know his doppelgänger!!! His name is Ian Harding, from Pretty Little Liars!!
When you talk about him being a taurus & he talks about food 😂😩
To me I see that Stewart looks like a mix of Tom Holland and the actor Sam Riley  :)
Y’all literally look perfect together………❤️
4:27 edzzzz😂😂😂😂
He looks like Barry Allen from the flash he looks like he can be named Barry as well
you probably have a sagittarius rising sign mia, which is explains why you're hilarious and your compatibility with your fiance
Congratulations! also it's funny because I am also a Pisces and my husband is a Taurus and definitely acts like one
My husband and I were both immediately like "He looks like MatPat." I legit thought the first shot of him was a pic of MatPat from Game Theorists and was very confused. 😂
I love how Mia's so vocal about her crushes. Like God, why can't I be like that. I'm super awkward and such. I need Mia's confidence!!! You go girl!
I got a part of naive on the Spotify part
Aahhhhh i stopped watching you because i havent gotten notifications
He looks  all three spiderman's mixed into one hahahahha
YES! Armand Duplantis!!! I sat and thought about it the hole time! Absolutely a lookalike!
❤️❤️❤️
Omg so cute 🥰
Hes a total gemini .... Very soft spoken
3 minute on, we got the "extra button undone" im wheezinggg 😂😂
Omg he looks so much like Gregg Sulkin, and maybe Ian Harding, or a mix of the two. I saw a comment a totally agree about these two.
Lmao at them knowing absolutely nothing about astrology except sun signs 🙃
To me he looks a little bit like Eddie Redmayne! Other people have said Andrew Garfield and I can see that too. Maybe a blend of them both? Also congratulations!!! Stuart is so cute and sweet, you two make perfect sense and I wish you a lifetime of happiness and blessings!
Andrew Garfield :)  And what a FUN video.  Thanks for sharing your fiancé with us!
The way he really focus on mia talking is beyond my mind . You really lucky to have a man loves you truthly , and i just love how he keeps on focusing on you and listen . LIKE REALLY LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE THING YOU SAID . Omg 1 in the million ! Congratulation mia ❤️
You guys are so cute
He laterally didn’t take his eyes off of her all long of the video and that’s sweeeeeeeeet ahh 😩❤️❤️❤️❤️
STOP HES ADORABLE IM SO HAPPY FOR YALL
You'r fiance looks bit like "carlos miranda" from station 19 🙏🌺😊
don't have three kids bro overpopulation is a real problem stay woke adopt
i kinda thought he looked like MatPat, but just slightly
I had no idea. How long have they been together?
Perfect for each other 🥺😍
Aweeeeeeee yall are cuteeeeeeeeeeee😭❤️❤️🥰🥰❤️❤️
get yourself someone that looks at you the way stuart looks at mia ❤
Awww Mia is growing up 🥺. Congrats bb
Honestly, he looks as if Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield had a child! Which makes the whole fav spidey convo even funnier x'D
I want an invite to your wedding perfect match 💕
He looks and kinda sounds like Penn Badgely.
Hi
I feel like he coverd you in choclate...its sweet to see you together...maybe you get three kids as once 😉 all best wishes to you and your famaly...hope the wedding will be a remeberable "event" and you will spend more than 7(0) years together!
These are the two most Canadian looking people ever
Me and my boyfriend are pisces and Gemini too!
He reminds me of joe Goldberg from the Netflix show you. Not his personality of course but he looks like him.
It was adorable to see how nervous he was doing this video but soo cute how he kept staring at you Mia!! He seems perfect for you!! Such a sweetie! 🥰 Congratulations on your engagement 💍 hope you guys have a wonderful life together ❤️
He can’t stop staring at her 😂
Just from this one video, you guys look like you get along very well. Also he seems like a very quiet person but you help him come out of him shell. Congrats and I wish the best for you both!❤️🤗
Well done Stuart. You did great xxxx
the energy i am getting from Stewart is like the awkward boyfriend who are meeting his partners parents for the first time, its very cute haha
Will definitely say a Pieces and Torus/Gemini cusp can work well! I was born May 21st, which is the cusp but technically Gemini (it’s the first day of Gemini) and my boyfriend is a Pieces. Him and I have been best friends since 6th grade and have been dating for almost 2 years (it’ll be 2 years on February 21st). If we’ve been friends since 2006 and have worked dating you guys should work too 😊
I feel like Stewart/Stuart looks like a mix of Jacob Elordi and Shawn Mendes😌
HE IS SO HANDSOME! Yay! So happy for you!
Is it safe to say that i might have gotten a slight crush on him 😳😳
Ohmygod the zodiac signes, a friend that loved me was a Pisces and I'm a Taurus sun with a Gemini rising !!! It makes very much sense to me (even though I thought a Gemini would be the extrovert and the Pisces an introvert ahah)
he is remind me of Hugh Grant actually , cute and handsome 🥰 , and I'm so happy for you guys ❤
y'all are adorable i'm so so happy for you!!
I'm a taurus
Almost looks like Greg Sulkin( aka Alex Russos ware wolf boyfriend in wizard of waverly place)
Am a Taurus ♉ ♉
Omg i love this!
i love you so much mia ya'll are sooo sooo cute and perfect❤️❤️❤️❤️🧿🧿
Ahhh you guys are so cute
He seems to in equal parts compliment you and balance you, I love that. Congrats!!!
his face is exactly what my brain pictures from the thumbnail ahah n u both look great together!
I rlly need Mia to see this bc idk if anyone else already said this but her bf looks JUST LIKE Mason Greyback!!!!! As soon as I saw him I thought it and then some how she asked if he looked like anyone at the end. Love you Mia❤️❤️❤️
He reminds me of my brother😅😅😅. Very sweet both of u.
Awwwww Mia so happy for you both ❤️🇰🇪
Andrew Garfield vibes !!
I’m only 26 and my body’s falling apart too 😂 my fiancé complains as well
Steve from blues clues, but with way better hair. No idea why my brain thought that.
Ahhh yess!! Y’all are amazing, COVID had hit me hard but yall always make me feel better :))
He looks like Hugh Grant to me ❤️
Stuart reminds me of young Jimmy Shergill 😅
He reminded me right away of Finn Wolfhard from stranger things🤔 And congrats on the engagement!!💕
He's very handsome, good good find, good luck in the future hope he's in the videos more often congratulations.
the way she said itadori hahaha its from a anime mia haha
He reminds me a lot of Ian Harding, He was one of the lead from show pretty little liars 💓 u both look so good together
He looks like the guy from flushed away x
Miaaaaa. Cusps are not a thing, your sun sign is either one or the other. But maybe his moon or rising is in Taurus.
He reminds me so much of Matpat from Game/Film/Food Theory!
Maybe I'm the only one but he looks kinda like Grant Gustin. congrats on the engagement wishing you both the best. 🎉🍾
I love the "i have an eXtrA bUtTon uNdonE?!"
Just because I’ve gotten more into zodiac. Compatibility comes more from full birth chart not just Sun sign. Also the personality we get from the signs are our full charts.
I feel so happy watching this video, you two are so genuinely heartwarming and the energy is so great!
I love this Mia I’m so happy for you!!! He gives me Edward Cullen vibes or sure 💗
I know this is a long while after this video was filmed, but I just re-watched parts and I think Stewart (Stuart?) reminds me of a YOUNG Jeremy Irons! Anyone else agree?
My husband and I are the same! He’s a Gemini and I’m a Pices😋 keeps things interesting I love it. He’s wild.
A young bob saget
Miaaaaaaaa my bebu calls me peanuttt too HAHAHAHAHA
It’s so funny that you asked for celeb doppelgängers cuz as soon as I saw him I was like omg he looks so much like Andrew Garfield! Haha
HES SO CUTE AWWWWW
Supper cute couple 💑...
He looks like Matt patt!!!!
Omg! Awww yay congrats!!!!
If somebody comments something mean I will hunt them down. I love your videos and you two are perfect for each other💕💖
😂😂 Stewart was like don't expose our horrible zodiac compatibility!!
Wow! He gave your mom a diamond necklace?! How sweet!💞
When Mia said who is more annoying? I was like: from Spider-Man? Hahahahha
Holy your kids' eybrows will be amazing
I love him, hes so sweet! Happy for you two ❤❤❤❤ btw he looks like Will from You on Netflix!
Good luck with everything, really happy for the two of you. I hope you will have a lovely wedding, thank you for the fun videos, I always enjoy the content. Stay happy and healthy 😊 xx 😘😘
I’m a pisces too and I always end up with Gemini and Taurus and it’s just so crazy  Also love you I been watching you for so long because we have very similar personality traits it’s weird but congrats wish u the best
The chemistry is beautiful. Congratulations on your engagement Mia <3! I think he kind of looks like Tom Halland, Joe from YOU or a young Tom Cruise tbh .
I feel like Stuart looks like someone I saw before but I don’t remember who and don’t even know if I’m thinking of a celebrity but totally wasn’t Stuart cause I’m a Mexican whose never been in Canada. Also I wanted to say that you seem to me an adorable couple ♥️
He looks like a young joe from you
I always look at your parents your brothers and I'm like this is such a good looking family and then you chose a super good looking husband hahaha you guys are so cute together
Your so cute
I compare my moon sign and rising sign with people I know because I feel like they portray a person better. My boyfriend and I are both Libra moons. He has a Taurus rising while mine is in Libra which is a pair known for their amazing connection!!!
He does remind me of someone! I get a total young Matthew Good vibe!
I'm on the cusp of Gemini and Taurus as well! Y'all are too cute!
Stuart looks a little bit like Patrick Schwarzenegger when hes looking on the side. I don't know. Maybe just me. Anyways I love how they both look at each other. You can feel the love 🥰 Congratulations to you both 🥰🥰🥰🥂
YALL ARE ADORABLE
🥺🥰💜💜💜
At the start of the video I thought "oh he kinda looks like Edward from Twilight and the guy from the show "You" and then at the end you asked if he looks like any celebrities. I wonder if anyone agrees with me. You two are super cute though, I'm so happy for you both.

The whole time I couldn’t stop thinking about how he looks like the game theory guy, Matthew Patrick and Gregg Sulkin from Wizards of Waverley place.
Stuart (sp?) is a beautiful guy - so polite, gentle, manly - total integrity.

I have dreamed of this day. Omg Mia you are the best and you deserve the best. So happy for you. Stuart has such kind eyes and an open expression. Omg the diamond necklace birthday gift. That's the sweetest.

I was watching the dog clothes video and she said when getting married I thought it was a joke… and then I saw this video ….
Mia, Stewart is almost cuter than you, and that is a lot to say because you are super cute. Baby gene lottery winners in the future!  You guys look great together, Stewart looks sweet and a wonderful guy. Thumbs up.
I hate how many bots and scammers I’ve been seeing comment on everyone’s comments! It’s not mias fault at all and I’m still gonna comment and watch just annoying lol. It’s not just her content either
He’s very handsome
Hello Mia, hope you read this. Your fiance is right for worrying about your constant back pain.  If it is not getting better real soon, it could be that your chiropractor is making it worse or at least isn't helping, because your back pain comes always back. Please see an actual doctor or physiotherapist who had medical training.  Here in Germany chiropractors have a bad reputation, because everyone can be one, you don't need medical training or a university degree. There were cases of people that have died because of visiting the chiropractor. I hope you find out what's causing your back pain soon 🙂 so you can treat it. Greetings from Germany
Love the way he looks at you
Stuart looks like he could be Peter Parker!
So freaking cute!!!!
I think he looks like a mix between Penn Badgley and Andrew Garfield :)
So cute- you look good together.  Blessing to you both!!

Thinking he looks like a young Hugh Jackman, and maybe a little like Tom Holland.
before the question you asked about him looking like a celebrity, I actually thought he gave me peter parker vibes 😂 maybe Andrew Garlfield
It was fun meeting him! I just hope he’s not being put in an awkward spot by being on camera. I totally respect someone who likes their privacy!
He seems so fun to be around and I think y’all just perfect for each other 🥺
He looks like Joshua Bassett tho
He is so adorable 😊
I ain’t judging, but the song coffee (by Chevy) is really good lol. (i believe him tho, that he didn’t listen to it) idk if that was actually that song tho
Mia! I did not know you were engaged 💍!! That is so great for you!  Happy for you! Also I guess I haven't watched you're videos in a while.😅

Funny you asked who he looks like. I think occasionally in the video he reminded me of MatPat. I feel like he also looks more similar to another person but I can't put a finger on it.
What advice would you give to a single 27 year old woman that desires marriage?
I am so happy for u. I've been watching u for so many years and I am so happy seeing u are thriving in ur life. U deserve it

It’s funny, I’m a Pisces & my fiancé is a Gemini💜
Tbh he needs his own channel like we need a vlog/family channel like day in the life
He honestly looks more like Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom or even Freddy Carter than Johnny Depp
When you said celebrity doppelganger I instantly thought of Bob Saget when he was young😏
He kinda looks like mason from wizards of waverly place. The werewolf guy. Just a little
WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE MATTPATT
I’m a Gemini and my husband is a Pisces, you’ll be just fine 😂❤️
Definitely a lovely couple!

Mia: "nothing about my personality irritates you?" Stuart: "nooooo." *scratches his neck*   lol. along the way there will be things that will bother one another, but i think it just comes down to being able to go through it with your partner. I love this already! yay, congrats!

He kinda reminds me of the youtuber MatPat haha. You wish you both all the happiness! Mia you deserve the best.
Honestly, he looks a lot like MatPat here on YT and somewhat like Gregg Sulkin from Wizards of Waverly Place. It was nice to put a face to the fiance! You two definitely are a great match :)

But really you two are TOO CUTE! Lots of love to both of you.

When I met my husband and we started dating my family’s dog was obsessed with him. That’s how you know you found the one! Good to see Chip feels the same.
He looks like the main male character in twilight 😁😁I don't remember his name🥲🥲
I want someone to use the other diamond to my ring to give to my mum in a necklace 😍😍 that is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever heard
Justin long is the actor i think
Ah!
❤
Do you guys live together? If not, Will he be moving in with you?
Right when I saw him I thought he looked like matpat
To me he looks like Joe from You but he could very well be a Cullen
now that we've seen him, can we see a proposal video. if it was captured on video.
you complement each other so well❤️ and he really does look like Ryan 😭
Gorgeous couple
I really have the feeling Mia organised this all to know what type of dress he liked 😂, but cool video 🙃
Thank you for sharing ☺️
He definitely reminds me of Penn Badgley!!!
I can't think of any celebrities he looks like, but he's super cute!!
He reminds me of Prince Charming (the real one not the Shreck one obviously 😅)
As SOON as I saw Stewart I thought he looked like Mat Pat!!
Maybe your sun is compatible with his moon, venus or ascendent. This also counts. You are a sweet couple. Congratulations. He seems to be very sensitive and this is what pices need.
Joe from the Netflix series YOU 😂🥰 love from Puerto Rico !! So happy for you guys! You make a cute a beautiful couple ❤️
HE IS SO GOODLOOKING AHH!! you guys look so cute together
you two are so cute together.. like made for each other... love it ❤
Ahhh he’s a cutie pie! You two look so cute together!
Of course he’s definitely a Gemini……that ring proved it we put a lot of thought into things for ppl they love. And when they love….they love
Adorable 😀my jaw is hurting from smiling throughout the video
Ok, y'all are so cute! As for celebrity lookalikes I think he looks a little like Penn Bagley- he's the guy that plays Joe in You on Netflix.
So happy for you both.  Thank you Stuart! ❤️
I’m a Taurus and he does give a Taurus vibe 😌
It’s the it-ah-dori for me Lmaoo

Young Tom cruise mixed with Elijah wood .
you should review clothes from ROMWE! I did order some stuff myself I wouldn’t recommend like sweat type pants but you could for a video but there jeans I love! 🥰🤍
He looks like Jake T. Austin and timothée chalamet.
You two reminds me of Rapunzel and Eugene 🥰🥰
I love you two together. Welcome to the Maples family, Stuart!
MIA! 3.18M subscribers, our birthday! :)))
He is Edward Cullen in my mind, I can’t unsee it. I’ve been thinking it since the beginning of the video lol
Omg he said dove and I’m convinced you’re soulmates
he kinda looks like a mix of penn badgley and andrew garfield
Idk why he gives me Andrew Garfield vibes!! I love it! And CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU TWO!!!!!! I’m so happy for you both. You guys are perfect for each other 💕💕💕💕💕💕
He looks like Jacob Elordi!! His smile does
When I saw him, his aura screamed Taurus to me. So yeah he’s gotta have some strong earth placement or something somewhere cause I agree with you, Mia!! You guys are so cute
I’m so glad he joked and dodged that annoying question. Bc my boyfriend and I just started living apart bc he was getting mad at me for my pain, and I found out I have a bulging disc, bone spurs, an inverted tailbone, and a curved spine… at 21. Like I get it that helping people can get annoying after it’s for awhile, but it’s important to still care and show compassion and understanding.
He reminds me of Chase Haddock hes married to Kenadee, her YouTube channel is Kenadee Kay
He looks like Steve from blue’s clues, Joe from You and Toby Maguire
I lost it at “bE A TAurUS!”😂😂💀
So happy 😩
Screaminggggggggg♥️♥️
He looks kind of like Timothee Chalamet, I think!

You guys remind me of a fairytale couple right out of a storybook. You two are perfect for each other and seem to be a match made in heaven.

Wow!!! So awesome to finally meet him! You guys are sooo cute together 💚
Why is he so gorgeous
Does Mia have a connective tissue disorder like Marfan syndrome? Her poor bones
So sweet! I love it!!!
I think he looks like Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland. When the question was asked about a favorite spiderman I was really shocked because I had been thinking he looked like a mix. *insert video of morphing all spiderman actors into one* lol
All I can say is: READ YOUR BIRTH CHARTS. It’ll explain everything! You are NOT just your sun sign.
He looks like a young Chris D'elia (L) you look so good together! :)
Talking of doppelgangers.... my mouth literally dropped like 😦😳 he's my ex boyfriend's long lost twin, but with floppier hair! The nose, the eyes, eyebrows, even down to the little weeny gap in his front teeth (which is adorable) - and he's a Gemini too 😅🤯
My heart is melting 😍😍😍😍 you are sooo cuteee
I skipped a couple episodes... 👌
Such a lovely Couple 💗 best wishes to you
To me, he looks like Alexander Koch from Under the Dome. And we love him, he’s perfect for you 😍
You guys are so cute together!!!  And I'm also a "so not Gemini" that's totally normal hahahaha

A young Bob Saget

Ohhhhh he's perfect for you Mia!! I'm so happy for you ❤️
I feel like he looks like Ezra from Pretty Little Liars 😭
So freaking adorable!
A bit like my two favorite Spiderman Toby and Tom. Stewart is adorable, he reminds me a bit of my oldest daughter Danielle's fiance.
He's so cute Mia. Congratulations again on your engagement
He looks like the blues clues guy!!
Well in the words of Hamilton you said to yourself "I'm not throwing away my shot"
He is  really handsome, Mia! I think that I would say Tom Holland for celebrity, just cause he was mentioned and he is in my head and he does look a bit alike, dont you think? BTW have you thought about the fact that when he often times agrees with momma maples is cause they both non compatible zodiacs with you and that makes them be on the same team? hahaha Maybe the zodiac was right just about petty arguments sides
He kinda looks like Penn Badgley! I especially think of Joe Goldberg lmao but just bc of his looks
YAY! Stuart!! I think he looks like Tom Holland. Congratulations to the both of you! ❤️❤️
you are a bit toxic, Mia
18:44 -Chris evans had entered the chat-                        👁👄👁
My heart is so happy! You guys are adorable!❤️  Edit: For the celebrity thing, he looks a lot like Mat Pat to me!
He reminds me of the Harries twins Jack and Finn, I think he kinda looks like them also Greg Sulkin
Tell him thank you so much for coming on the channel!!
Smiling from ear to ear watching this
I am not surprised that your mom is a sagittarius at all because I love her personality so much and I tend to love sagittariuses. They tend to give very friendly vibes and their vibes are easily meshed with yours.
He looks like Penn Badgley😅
I was actually assuming Mia would say that Garfield was her favorite spiderman because Stuart kind of looks like him
Yes, Stewart looks like Ansel Elgort, from West Side Story or back in the day Wizards.of Waverly Place..! Congrats you are such a sweet couple.
I love how you included your mums reaction 😍
He looks like MatPat. If you don't know who that is look up a picture its a little scary how alike they look
We loooooove the fiancé ♥️
I appreciate you doing  the video 💛 Love how happy you guys are. 😀
My husband and I are Pisces and Gemini too!! I got excited😂😂 you guys are so fun! Welcome Stuart!
😆 silly me smiling throughout the video 😂 you guys are lovely im happy for both of youu
You look like a couple. It’s sweet,
Bob Saget is who Stewart reminds me of
I love how you’re his safety blanket in this video. You two are perfect!
My mom is a Pisces and I'm a Sagittarius and we get along great!
His face and hair I got definitely romantic comedy vibes. I’d say best resemblance in his face would be Noah from the kissing booth.
You guys are such a cute couple!! So happy for you Mia!!
as soon as the zodiac sign question came up i was like "he's defo a gemini" and then you confirmed it???? HOW THE HELL DID I KNOW??? ALSO GEMINIS ARE SUPERIORS AND MISUNDERSTOOD AF WBK 🥰
He knows how lucky he is!
He looks at her with so much love!
It's not a test! I'm so happy for you, Mia! You are beautiful together.
Thank you Stewart! I hope to see you again soon when you are ready! Also he kind of looks like Flynn Rider from tangled and you give Rapunzel vibes! (I know that’s not a celebrity but same vibes haha!)
okay but he keeps looking at mia, I wish y'all the happiest life together 🥺
Edward cullen!!
Please draw Stewart’s ideal wedding dress and send it to that company to make🤣 also love this video and can’t wait to see a video with mama maples and Stewart!!
Yay fiancé! He kind of reminds me of Robert Pattinson a little bit. From Twilight. However, I didn’t get too many glances at his face because he COULDN’T TAKE HIS EYES OFF YOU!  Also, Did you have to look up which way to spell Fiancé? I didn’t even know their were 2 different ways until I got engaged and started buying all the Fiancé and Fiancée shirts and realized they were different! 😂 so nice to meet you Stuart! Thank you for being such a good sport!
💜💜💜
MIA can you please shop from starlight fair you would love love LOVE the clothes. Pls do a clothing haul
I wish u all the good things in life mia!❤️
It's so nice for him to get involved when he knows it's q passion of yours. He's seems a beautiful soul that completely and utterly matches you 110% ❤❤ congratulations again to you both. I wish you both a most amazing happy life together ❤  full of love, adventures and you tube videos as I can't not have Mia videos 😂
SHAWN MENDEZ!!!!! THATS WHO HE LOOKS LIKE
I think he look so much like Ian Harding from pretty little liars !!!😳😳😳
I can attest to the zodiac thing not always being right. I am married to someone who is supposed to be a perfect match for me, but we are getting divorced 😂 (this has nothing to do with our signs of course, but it’s just proof that just because it says it, doesn’t make it true!) you guys are so cute, so happy for you!
AHHH YALL LOOK SO GOOD TOGETHER OMG SO CUTEE😩🥺   AND CONGRATS!!!!💞💕

Here’s my Answer to your question: I personally think you both look like Rapunzel and Flynn Ryder! I swear it was my first thought when I saw you together!
Your kids will have awesome hair!🤎. I thought he looked like the Spider-Man guy Andrew G before you even mentioned it‼️

🥰🥰🥰
I love you both together so much!!! You can tell how much he adores you and is such a perfect fit!!! Can’t wait to see you both more
The first actor who comes to mind, that he resembles is actually Andrew Garfield. Tall, dark hair and dark eyes. He also kind of reminds me of a young, dark eyed Tom Welling. Or maybe a young James Stewart. Young Michael Fassbender, perhaps? I think he also looks like Steven R. McQueen. And he also reminds me of Shawn Mendes a little lol.  Nice to see him! Love you Mia!❤️‍🔥
A young Tom Cruise
He's so cute, he's so shy camera- he can't even stare at the camera and looks at her for the whole time.
So dang cute and wholesome, so so happy for you guys!

My husband and I once went to browse in a fortune tellers store while we were waiting for our show reservations.  This was probably our 4th or 5th date.  The fortune teller came out and asked our signs.  She shook her head and said "it will never work".  Well, that was 25 years ago and we've been happily married with 2 college-aged boys.  I wouldn't worry too much about your astrological signs.  You guys are a beautiful young couple.  Congratulations on your engagement!!
You guys are absolutely adorable!!! Also, on the question about turtlenecks and sweatpants... Mia: That's so random!?... Also Mia *wears sweatpants and turtlenecks constantly*
omg David Tennant twin???
This was adorable!!!! he looks like if Harry Connick JR, Hugh grant and Tom Cruise had a baby!!!

He looks like young Bob Saget! Tell me otherwise…
He is so precious just like you 😫🤍

Dan humphries

Luv ya guys…like literally ✨
He kinda looks like Joe from You 😂
Se ven hermosos como pareja 🥰   En cuanto a los signos del zodiaco es super relativo por que en realidad somos un signo en especifico de acuerdo en donde este el sol en el momento del nacimiento, pero tambien hay que tener en cuenta a los demas planetas, su ubicación y la hora de nacimiento para ver la carta natal que es mucho mas especifica con respecto a la compatibilidad.
I think he looks like young Robert Pattinson like Cedric in Harry Potter
I feel like he looks like Robert Pattinson!
Stewart looks like Joe from YOU 😂💚💚 love you both xoxo
I loved this! You guys are so perfect for each other!!!😍😍😍
The closest doppelgänger I can think of is John Francis Daley (freaks & geeks, waiting, bones) but when he was younger.
yooo he’s exactly how i imagined him to look like! i’m a genius
He does look like some celebrity but I forgot the name🤔
He’s so sweet🥺 exactly what you deserve
Hello Stuart and welcome to Mia Maples life and thanks for saying hi to all of us 👋👋👍🙏🏻✝️♥️🙂😃😉🧚‍♀️👼🎈🎈🌈🌈
Hi Stewart! Nice to meet you! Thank you for being in the video and answering our questions! 😊
You know who his doppelgänger is, it’s Ezra Fitz from pretty little liars!! That’s who he reminds me of.
I’m a Pisces & my bf is a Gemini lol we’ve been together almost 3 years now :)
at first glance he reminded me of Freddie highmore! he's so sweet and you guys look amazing together 😍
He somehow looks like jacob elordi but like the thinner version 😅
His style and hair and some face features reminds me of joe Goldberg! Luckily not the same personality though 😭💀
Jacob Elordi!
Alright, you guys are too cute. Thank you for this video !!! 🥰
The Kooks!!!
He reminds me of Robert Pattinson. Y’all are adorable! Love you Mia!
This is so nice, that he joined the video for you ❤
Hahahaha my husband is a Gemini and I am a cancer! We are far from compatible but he is my soulmate! This video was so fun! Congratulations on the engagement ❤️
THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU I'M CRYING AND SHAKING OH MY GAWD I'M SO OBSESSED AND HAPPY FOR U

Aaah. You guys are literally the cutest together!! btw I think he looks like a young Matthew good (tho we did mostly see him from the side so this may have influenced my perception)
Mia! You need to use the app Timepassages for zodiacs! It shows your whole chart and will explain yalls relationship better than just your sun sign
The only doppelgänger I can think of for Stewart is my boyfriend! They’re literally the same person except my boyfriend has glasses, it was very strange for the first few minutes of this video 🤣
Try the compatibility of your natal chart.
He looks exactly how I imagined
He gives me Edward Cullen vibes. There I said it.
HE'S SO CUTE! I am so happy for you guys! You are a beautiful couple.
Not a celebrity doppelgänger, but his voice reminds me of Melman’s the giraffes from Madagascar 🤣❤️
Omg!!! Love you guys!! So cute

Thanks for sharing! Stewart, don’t feel pressured to be on here all the time! Come hang with us on your own time. Congrats to the both of you. Mia, thanks for giving us a glimpse of your “stubby” lol!

I would say your fiance has some resemblance of Andrew Garfield!!
"I wish you'd take more risks" "I have an extra button undone" lmao he's funny. Definitely a keeper
Ok so I don’t know if anybody sees this, but he looks like young Bob Saget.
I just want to say a big thank you and welcome to Stuart! Thank you for stepping out of your comfort zone, and it's clear that you care for Mia and you seem like an amazing guy! Excited to get to know you more!
In my opinion Stuart’s celeb look alike is Penn badgley from you

“He’s a Gemini...... but he’s SO NOT a Gemini, guys...” 😆  Definitely something I’d say! My bf is a Virgo and so am I. But I’m 100% Virgo and he acts nothing like one.

He’s giving off Joe from You vibes, is it just me?
Toby forever!

Oh he's so sweet! I love the way he looks at you.
Stewart: You do not owe anybody to be in the videos if you don't want to. It is ok to say no.  I don't think that anybody will unfollow Mia, just because you say no to being in more videos. But thank you for doing it this time.

HELLO STEWART!! Welcome to the family!!❤❤
I can see Shawn Mendes / Tom Holland mix 😅
That's crazy because I'm a Pisces (03/02) and my husband is not a Gemini, but a Taurus (05/18). My sister is a Gemini (05/28)
Mia: BeCaUsE
You guys are sooo cute 😭😭😭😭😭
You guys are so cute and perfect together. You even look similar! Best wishes 🌹🎉
he seems like such a sweet guy, you guys seem to be in love. makes me soft
I got a shock when I saw the title as I missed the "I got engaged" video. I went and watched that one and now I'm back lol. I'm so happy you you Mia!! Y'all seem like a great balance with your outgoing personality and his calmness. Stewart seems like a wonderful partner that will make a great husband and father. Looking forward to future videos with him! Also, throughout the video I was thinking he reminded of young Bob Saget (was so sad to hear about his passing) so I thought it was perfect you asked about his celebrity look alike
seems closeted tbh, ik they aint done the deed
Awww yes! Fellow Taurus(in theory)... Lol
Stuart looks like matpat from the side!
He looks like Andrew Garfield !!
Awww MIA!!! You two look adorable together! Stewart is so handsome! Congratulations guys!! ❤❤
Why do you guys look like rapuzel and Flynn rider
This was so cute and you two are so sweet! And tbh Stewart reminds me a lot of a YouTuber named matpat who used to be pretty popular? Definitely twins aha!
I have no complaints. Such a beautiful couple! He is amazing!! 🥺
OMG he looks so so cute and humble person
Congratulations 🎊🎈🍾🎉
Doppelgangers: Matthew Goode Tom Holland Paul Scheer (the smile)
Congrats,  he's adorable.
I think everyone loves him now and you are definitely the funniest person I've seen.
The moment I saw Stuart, I thought he was MatPat. Also, he looks like he could be one of the spidermans
Ugh you guys are so perfect together🥲 love to see it!!!

His celebrity look alike is MatPat
Just wanna say real quick that I'm a Virgo, but so close to being a Libra and I rly feel like I'm a Libra at least half the time lol
Such an attractive couple. He seems very sweet
His outfit looks like my husbands work uniform. His job is pretty risky, so I’d say he takes risks. 😂😂
He looks like Charlie Puth!
YOU LOOK GREAT TOGETHER!! 🥺😍
the way he looks at you 😍
Peanut and Stubby hahahaha !! That's very cute
Love seeing how she’s more herself when he’s around! I think that’s what makes for a good partner.

Sorry but the editing got me wheezing sometimes-😭😂 You look great together, what precious smiles!💖
Flynn rider and rapunzel hehehe
Staurt is handsome and sweet! Glad to have you here, come whenever you're comfortable ☺️
I’m a Gemini and my best friend is a Pisces!
So sweet 🥺❤️
So much more than sun signs for astrology. What signs are the other planets in? Diving deeper will def give you a better idea of why he doesn't seem like a gemini, etc. 😋
Joe and love…
You probably wont read this but zodiac signs are more than just your sun sign! (the sign assignated to you the day you were born) There is this thing called a natal chart that is made from every planet and every sign and those things dictate differents aspects of your life and how you act in them. Many astrologers dont believe in cusps, but is very possible that Stuart has taurus somewhere in his chart!
Awww you guys are so cute !! Warm welcome to Mia’s fiancé, Stuart 🥳
He gives me Andrew Garfield vibes,..  You and your fiance make me think of me and my now husband,  I'm a pisces and he's a Gemini and my personality is similar to yours and his seems similar to Stuart like calm, reserve, caring and smart laid back guy. Also similar in ages I'm 23 and he's 26
❤️❤️❤️ his doppelgänger is Penn Badgley
So happy for you mia, we approve of Stewart little !! 😂❤️
This is soooo cute! I’m cracking up! My husband also gets real nervous 🤣🤣🥰
I'm a Gemini and by jove am I a Gemini 😅
Omg what a cutie! You guys are so cute I can’t! 😩 Congratulations ❤️❤️
“More style..? I have an extra button undone.” 🤣🤣

omg, Ezra Fitz from pll <3 so handsome and sweet, very happy for you <3
When he said “I have an extra button undone” I immediately thought 💭 yeah you two are a match lol. Your humor is THE SAME.
You two make such a sweet & beautiful couple 😊 I can see the love & respect you have for each other and that will go a long way. Not surprised that Mama Maples loves Stuart!! Congrats and just enjoy this time without stressing too much. God bless ❤🇨🇦☺

Tom Cruise

MIA HERE'S SOME CELEBS I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE!!!!!!! I'd say he looks VERY SIMILAR to Marcus Harman (he plays Evan in DEH on the west end) but also looks a little like Eddie Redmayne, Nick robinson (but with a more slender face) and a bit like Joe Thomas ............. also congrats you two this was such a cute video to watch xxxxx
He looks like Joe Goldberg from you
The way you guys look at each other 🥰 reminds me of how your dad looks at momma maples 😭😭😭

That's so smart you waited to reveal the Man until proposal.. You never know with men, and his move to propose you was serious enough to show him officially to the world. You look absolutely amazing together and I wish you all the love and happinessssss! :)
You two are so cute, i love this!! I’m looking forward to seeing more vids with him, if he’s comfortable with it of course !!!

Need a love button for this video!
Your fiance reminds me of someone, but I can't pinpoint it and it's driving me CRAZY!
SHAWN MENDES
Mia....the men always become the mama's favorite! Just a friendly warning =D =D. I want anything and my  mom's response is "need to pay it back" or "work it off". My husband wants or needs anything and mom's response is "ok, no problem". Again, friendly warning LOL
So happy he wanted to be in this video! Really loved it! 💖

I think Stuart looks like a mix of Robert Patterson and a young Vince Vaughn, I was so glad when you asked at the end of the video cause I had been thinking about it the whole time watching!
Your fiancé reminds me so much of my husband lmao
You’re fiancé reminds me so much of my husband lmao
Stuart looks like so many people i cant even pinpoint it, im just looking at him and thinking "he looks like someone i know, but i have no idea who"... also, the most random thing ever but he looks like he'd be from Switzerland (dont ask idk either)
Ohhh your Fiance is adorable!!!!

I've been trying to think of which celebrity he looks like racking my brain all day and night. To me he kind of looks like a young Steve Carell !
He kind of looks a little Matt Barzal from the New York Islanders.
i could be going out on a limb here, but Stuart looks like the guy in Geek Charming!

His INTENSE discomfort the entire time and Mia the pro. That took guts aww, what a good guy!!
I swear you found the male version of you!!!!! Oh my goodness what a great couple.
I definitely see a young Ashton kutcher and a little Justin timberland !
Stuart looks like Danny Tanner ( RIP)
his celebrity look alike is deff Joe Goldberg from You
He looks like the guy in YOU
Aww 🥰 you guys are adorable!!! It’s nice to finally see his face To the person you have been talking about and I think he did amazing for his FIRST video! Can’t wait to see more videos with him! You guys should do the “boyfriend rates my outfits” or something along those lines!!!
You guys are so cute! From the side Stewart looks like Justin Trudeau…… or is that just me.
You guys are the CUTEST!!🤍
HE IS PRECIOUS!!!!!!! love u guys!!!!!
I’m seeing twilight haha
Omg what the heel he looks like Mat Pat from Game and Film theory my fav YouTubers as well
Congrats on the engagement!!!!! You both are so cute and are perfect for each other.
I'm married to a Stuart, will be 10 years in May and he is the most amazing man! So so happy you found your Stuart 😊🥰
MIA you need to see an OSTEOPATH not a chiropractor, I swear it will change your life.
Omg I love you two 🥲
HE LOOKS LIKE SAM CLAFLIN!!!! Omg from the beginning I kept thinking he looked like a celebrity and I couldn’t put my finger on it lol
Why do I think he looks kinda like Cole Sprouse
what a sweet, wholesome boy :’)
I just wanted to give a big thank you to Stewart for giving us the pleasure and privilege to see and get to know him as his own person and Mia’s fiancé!🥺😌
Congratulations on your engagement and upcoming wedding. You look very happy together.  He looks like John Francis Daley who played Dr Lance Sweets in Bones.
Honestly gemini's aren't that outgoing.. I'm a full on gemini and I hate people. I'm an introvert and I like to stay home. My boyfriend is a Pisces and is more outgoing then me.. 😂 but look at your whole chart, not just your sun sign or big 3 (sun, moon and rising). I like to look at the venus and mars signs as well
I think he looks like Andrew Garfield
My fiancé and I are also a Gemini & Pisces pairing. I’m a Gemini and he’s a Pisces, but I also feel like we’re compatible as well. But I did love the work through anything together idea. Anyways, love y’all and so excited to be able to see you two interact in this video & future ones!
Omg he looks so nerdy. I already love him! I though I would find like a douch face, but I'm happy he doesn't 😅 no offence! He's even a gemini and has my same phone 🤣🤣🤣
You two are perfect!! Stuart is great mia !!!💓💓💓
I love the fact that Mia seems to be more nervous about filming. You two are so cute together! Congrats!☀️
My husband said he kind of looks like Matt Pat but with darker hair, I kind of agree with that!
You are so cute together! He reminds of the actor robert sean leonard in the movie dead poets society!
They way he looks at you is adorable🥰
What a sweetheart!
Thank you for being Brave! Y’all are the cutest couple! Biggest Congratulations!!!!
So funny that the spidey question came up and my first thought was "man he looks a lot like Andrew G" so yea that is definitely his celebrity look alike
Love Love Love you two together. So beautiful to See true Love. Whish you alle the best :) Also he kinda reminds me of the guy From You (Netflix Show) :D
Welcome to the family Stuart! You can definitely tell there is so much love in his eyes for Mia. And she is more than deserving of it with her big heart!  I am so happy for you two! I thought he looked like Matt part from game theory for a sec when clicking on the video. Not really celebrity but fellow YouTuber!
GUYS but like for real - they are real life DISNEY's TANGLED COUPLE, omg am I the only one who sees it, I caaaaaaan't it made me so excited
He definitely looks like one of the Beatles maybe ringo or a mix of 2 of them
This is hilarious, I love his responses! I get you with the how many kids questions haha! But yeah at first I was thinking 5 kids, now that I have two I’m like 🤔 maybe I’ll stop or just one more??? Still want a girl....I’ve been watching you for years now and now I’m married with 2 kids. I’ve always felt like I’ve related to you but stopped feeling that way once I got married and now I feel more on the same page again. He seems like a keeper!! So glad he came on, this video is so fun! 3/4 of the way through watching this video just had to throw in that comment 😂
WHere’s your sweater from?
So sweet! Love that we finally got to meet him! He’s definitely a keeper😉 Celebrity doppelgänger would be Shawn Mendes! That’s who I thought he looked like instantly!
omg am so happy for u
for your question, he looks like someone but I dont know who😭
OMG YOU TWO TOGETHER 😚🤌🏽✨ He’s a keeper!!
He’s so cute omgg
I’m technically a Taurus but I’m on the cusp of Aries. I almost exclusively act like a Aries 🤷🏻‍♀️

I'm such a shy awkward person,  I admire Stuart for being so brave going on camera.

I’m here cheesing like this is my relationship lol love this for you Mia I wish y’all the best
You look like a couple from the Twilight saga whhhaatttt Congrats!
Normaly I don't comment on videos, just watch them and leave a like. But I really had to step into the comments after watching this one to tell you that you're such a cute couple& I really like the video.
Tom Holland is the best spider man no question. (He is also the only I have seen but I have also seen clips of the others and I still think that tom is the best (it's probably also because he's my celebrity crush:) ))
I'm getting serious Edward Cullen vibes from this guy
Hi misbha🌝
YES! TOBY!!! I got into an argument with some youngins sitting next to me in the theater about who the best is 😂😂 Thanks for validating me, Mia 😁❤️❤️
YALL SO CUTE. Mia, i'm sure i speak for all of us when I say we 100% approve of Stewart and wish you bucket-loads of happiness forever <3
I think he looks like young handsome Bob Saget!
i can't stop laughing at "shoot your shot kids" dskjbdsafadfs i'm so sorry
for some reason i just see him looking like matpat
Oh my goodness yall are so sweet for each other awieee🥰🥰
Omg y’all remind of Suki Waterhouse and Robert Pattison!! And I just found out he is Batman which made my life.
My boyfriend and I are not at all compatible either when it comes to the zodiac signs. But we don't care! You guys are great together. Hope we can watch you two grow together.
you guys are so cute together!! ngl kind freak out at first because stuart looks a lot like my brother and yesss i feel like their face has a lot of look alike especially from actors
Mia, the reason why your back is probably hurting all the time is because you go to the chiro!!! please do some research about them. You will find out they do absolutely nothing for your back.
i leave for 5 months and Mia's engaged 😭💜
Ohhhh mia im so excited and glad he agreed to be on your channel He can be a modellllllllll😍👍 Congrats to both of you my loves Let's all support them and wish them the best(*´ω｀*)

Loved this! Hi Stewart! It’s not easy to be in front of a camera, You did great:) I also think Mia is very funny. Such a fan of this channel and everyone on it💗
1. You two are so sweet together. and 2. He looks like an early 90's young James Marsden. (especially in that episode of the nanny where he's dating maggie- super specific i know. sorry. hehe)
Awwww my husband is a Taurus and I'm a Pisces and we work so well together! Stuart can be an honorary Taurus! <3
Good score Mia😜 Stewart is adorable.
He looks so handsome 😍
Stuart looks a bit like a pale Shawn Mendes
Congratulations! You make a beautiful couple.☮️💜
Yay so happy for you both.  I will say I was a bit scared he was going to be my ex, we live in the same area and the hair looked so familiar but happy to say he is not. Phew! Back to being happy for you both.
stew has such doe eyes and super lovely dark hair, what a cutie. when he's a bit older, i'm pretty sure he'll look good with a beard, too, no? hope he's as nice in person as he was on camera. wishing you the best!
I’m a Gemini but not a Gemini too!
Im a Gemini and my boyfriend is a pisces
He looks like Penn Badgley!

#33 ON TRENDING MIA!! Almost a million views I think this speaks for itself ✨✨✨
It took me a whole day to think of it, but he looks and gives off the vibe of Eve’s boyfriend Rob from Last Man Standing! (Travis Tope)
My mom is a Pisces and my dad was a Gemini...they were so in love and happily married for 35 years until he passed away.  My dad always stood up for my mom and my mom always emotionally supported my dad. It was a WONDERFUL match.♡♡♡
He's so sweet... And cute 😝 Mia won the lottery...

Doppelgängers: David Tennant / Andrew Garfield

I’d say a celebrity look-a-like would be Greg Sulkin. Mostly from the side.  So happy to meet you! You guys are so cute!
if he’s on the cusp he can be either zodiac signs or have traits from both!!
I think his celebrity dopleganger is Gregg Sulkin 💖
Is it weird to say he looks like a mix of brise hall (don't know how to spell his name) and matpat from gametheory
Robert pattison
He reminds me of Robert Pattinson in a really weird way

I turned this video on while I was driving and then I heard Stuart speak and I had to stop and look down. The way he talks and acts is just like your family, it’s so nice to see how much he fits into the Maples family! Excited for you two! You look so happy Mia! Can’t wait for the wedding video:)

Here I am again, watching the two of you, and smiling like an idiot. 🥰
I was smiling the entire time watching this. You two make my heart so happy!!! You both are so lucky to have one another 🤍
I think Stuart looks like a mix between Nat Wolff and Jacob Elordi!
He looks so much like Edward Cullin from twilight ( Robert Pattinson) :)
“I have a extra button undone” ok that’s it I love him you’ve convinced me
Celeb lookalikes: I think he looks like a younger Andrew Garfield.
Getting bob saget (rip) from the full house days from stuart for sure! Also he’s so cute and y’all are so cute!
He’s sooo cuteeeee
3:18 “ I have an extra button undone”😂😂💀
he looks like Gregg Sulkin!!!!!!! also so happy for you <3
He’s a mixture between Gregg Sulkin (mason /Alex’s boyfriend from wizards of waverly place) and Penn Badgley (Joe Goldberg from the Netflix show “You”)
On the kid part, Mia, SAME. Birthing sucks, the kids are awesome tho.
Andrew Garfield maybe??? At who I think Stuart’s celebrity look alike is lol! love you Mia and thankful for Stuart for being in this video!
Somehow he looks exactly how my mind pictured him lol. Y'all are very cute together.
Honestly, I'm smiling from the start till the end. You guys are so cute together, I can see that you both are very thoughtful towards each other and it's such a beautiful thing to see!!!
You guys are adorable?
How cute it was great to be able to watch you guys work together on this channel. So happy to see Mia happy.

Well with the ring, and Mama Maples necklace and how sweet he seems and how you guys look at eachother is the sweetest and he has won me over.
They're adorable!!!!
I love how he just constantly looks at Mia. ❤️❤️❤️
omg they look so perfect together i love this!!!!!!!!
He looks so cute🙈♥️♥️♥️
Mia he is so sweet! 💘 How he looks at you so lovingly!😍😌  Robert Pattinson in Twilight as Edward Cullen, from the side, that color kinda washes him out & he is really fair skinned.
The cutest couple! Need a wedding photographer 😉?
i’m seeing Stewart as a young David Schwimmer haha
Looks like you are BOTH funny! 3:06  "This isn't risky enough?!? I have an extra button undone."
"This isn't risky enough?!? I have an extra button undone." 😂😂😂
Me and my friend are Pieces and Gemini I'm a Gemini
3:03 “I have an extra button undone” ✨risky✨ i couldn’t stop laughing 😂 love him for you already
Bob Saget, rip You may need to adjust one of your soles on your shoes, for your back to stop hurting...Just a thought. Congrats on everything. You are funny.
Awwwwwww you guys are the cutest I am gonna cry~~😭😭😭😭 This is super sweet I enjoy watching you hang out in front of the camera for us it's so sweet and adorable~awww~~💖💖💖
hes weirdly similar to what i pictured besides the eyes
hE sHowEd Us hiS face     I love this
Stuart looks like MatPat !!!! Love seeing you so happy Mia ♥️♥️ You guys are too cute together
Aww he's too cute! Nice to meet a new friend!!!!
huge thanks to him for stepping out of his comfort zone and sharing with us!! such an adorable couple, congrats❤️
Tbh he looks like matt McGuire but like older
You guys are so adorable!!! Stewart seems so kind and sweet to you Mia!! Hopefully you guys have an amazing dayy love you ❤️ can’t wait for more videos with you guys together!
OMG!!! You two could not be more adorable together!!!  So sweet!! I have an idea, maybe you could do a video or even a series where you do stuff together where the chosen activity is out of the other's comfort zone? It's sort of like team building, but for couples. I can totally hear Mia saying, "Challenge accepted!".  P.S. I think 3 babies sounds about right, but it's okay if you only have 2. If you have more room in your hearts for more, you can always adopt. Any kid would be lucky to have you as parents, and Mama Maple would spoil them rotten no matter what. Love you guys!!!  P.S.S. Mia, did you know that 2022 color of the year is Very Peri? Girl, I'm rooting for purple in your wedding. 💜💜💜
Wow omg I love Stuart!
I feel like Stuart looks a little like Collin Vogt. You two are adorable. So happy to meet him. 💓
Just like many others have said in the comments, seeing the way he looks at you says it all💓 I am so glad that I found your channel about a month ago! I love it so much and  I am so excited to go on this wedding journey with you and am so glad to have gotten to meet your fiancé. You two look perfect together, truly!
So sweet! You guys are awesome! ❤️
Oh my gosh y’all are sooooo cute! Stewart lowkey looks like jack & finn, fellow youtubers from the UK

I think he looks a bit like a young Bob Sagat. RIP
first thing i thought when i opened the video and saw stuart's side profile - he looks SO MUCH like matpat!! idk if that counts as a celebrity but when you asked i had to say it. loved meeting him, y'all obviously make each other so happy!!
I literally SCREAMED when I saw you guys together🥺🥺 SO CUTEEE

He reminds me sooooo much of my friend’s brother-in-law who is a total sweetheart! You can tell he just adores you 🥺
He's handsome 😍😍😍... You two are so cute couples
I think it depends on your rising sign and moon sign  as well .  You should try looking his up and maybe his rising is tarus.
You two are so cute! I'm so happy for you both!
IS IT JUST ME BUT I SEE A SHAWN MENDES RESEMBLANCE IDK WHY
Mia! I'm so happy for you both 🥰 This really shows the love between you two and you just look absolutely adorable together! My bet on famous people he looks alike has to be Penn Badgley
U guys r so cute together ❤
purrrr
I give him major props for doing this bc I would be way to nervous.
The loving and adoring way you both look at each other is heartwarming and you both seem perfect for one another - so happy you both found your forever person 🥰

To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins

I'm so glad you're on the same page about the important stuff like kids for example. I recently had to cut ties with my ex of 4 and a half years because of that topic. We just couldn't see eye to eye on that one and our feelings for each other were too strong to stay friends (we tried and relapsed). I'm heartbroken... But happy for you guys! :)
I know I'm a little bit older than Mia but I want them to adopt me
I'm so glad he doesn't seem like a jerk! I hope you keep each other happy and treat each other well and remember to value and respect each other!  💗 Thank you for sharing such an important par of your life with your fans.

I say this in the nicest way possible: he is not used to being in front of and speaking to the camera and therefore to the public but that he kept looking at Mia the whole time was just adorable! Actually made it more perfect!

He is so cute! I'm so happy we finally get to see him! He's like so calm compared to Mia! Lol I bet they compliment each other really well!
The simple Gospel is to trust in the shed Holy Blood of Christ Jesus. BELIEVE in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the Gospel! 1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 which is the Gospel tells us that we are saved by trusting in the Lord Jesus death, burial, and resurrection. Ephesians 1: 13-14 says that we are sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise until the day that God redeems us. Ephesians 2: 8-9 is clear in that we are saved by grace through faith and not by our works or by what we do or do not do..
pleeeaseee he is the cutest bean ever 🥰🥰🥰
Dean Moriarti
He looks like Daniel Radcliffe

Joe Goldberg is that you??? Haha.. the way he looks at you the whole time🥺
Stuart reminds me of the actor who plays Edward in Narnia Congratulations guys, so cute!
When I first saw him I saw Louis Partridge then I also started seeing Gregg Sulkin
Love his hair. Love his shirt. Love it! Adorable
loved this! thanks for letting us meet you stuart!!
That's so funny that you'd ask who he looks like! Because the second I saw his face I saw a Downton Abbey character. I'm currently kinda obsessed with the series so no surprise, but he's so reserved and smart looking in this situation that he does remind me of an English aristocrat. The one I'm thinking of is kind of a rude and posh fellow, Larry, the son of lord Merton. But that comparison is purely physical! His character is more like lord Gillingham, who's a very honorable and sweet gentleman 🎩♥️
You too are adorable together! Thank you for sharing
He looks like penn badgley lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣 When he said "this isn't taking a risk?" And "I have a extra button undone" I knew he was the one for you 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He looks like a young penn badgely from the tv show YOU
Finally we met him!!!! I think he looks like Penn Badgley from netflix series "You"!!
I am convinced Stuart looks like the male version of Anne Hathaway
I totally see Andrew Garfield! Also this was so fun
He looks just like Bella Swan in Twilight!!! LOVE YOU SO MUCH :)
Looks like Robert Pattison to me
The way he looks at you is everything!!
Hi, congratulations to you both. I think your Fiancé looks like a young Bob Saget. 🥰 Much love from Minnesota 💖💖💖
Such a BEAUTIFUL COUPLE. Y'all are prescious!
I think he looks like Andrew Garfield
My boy Stuart looks like a young Orlando Bloom
probably he looks like edward cullen :3 (robert pattinson), u both look so cute, are amazing couple
Awwwww 😍😍, what a cute couple!
Yall are the epitome of chaotic good and i am living for it. Love you Mia and Stuart (sp?) :)
The way he looks are you is precious and he just seems like a good fit for you.
I love that he just stares at you the whole video.   That boy loves you.  🥰😍
Why does he look like a combination of Joe Goldburg and my exboyfriend 😅
you guys look perfect together!💚😭 so happy!
He's really handsome
Gregg sulkin
So excited for this new chapter in your lives! He’s so handsome Mia! Brb moving to Canada. Y’all make such a cute couple! 💕
DO YOUR BIRTH CHARTS!!!! If your man is a cusp take his birth time and birth place to astro cafe website and look up his chart! I have a lot of friends who are Taurus but a few who are Gemini. I cant tell he definitely has a mix of the two signs! Even if his Sun sign is a Gemini he could be a Taurus Moon or other planet maybe in Taurus.  Also I"M LIVING FOR THEIR CHEMISTRY!! You guys 10000% fit each other personalities.
Adorable ❤️
Y’all fit together perfectly!
try functional patterns for your back
He looks like matpat! Thats a compliment btw! ❤
Once a girl told me she liked me and I told her that I don’t like her back and plus am straight and Muslim and then she got mad at me for not likening her back so don’t shot your shot and idk I just hate her there’s a lot more of things she did so yeah she’s just weird lol
I love seeing you two together and his personality is so refreshing, a little shy, genuine and sweet! I'm excited to see more of you guys but no pressure! :) As for celebrity lookalikes - I immediately thought of Andrew Garfield!
well idk if MatPat can be called as a celebrity, but they definitely match alot in my eyes ♡
He look like James blunt but young like when he came out with the song your beautiful.
Jacob Elordi twin🥺 love you guys
He looks like joe from “you”
at first glance when i see him, he looks like MatPat from Game Theory. And they do have some resemblance
He looks like William from Skam Norway 😂
u both look amazing together♥♥ congrats mia and fiance
Ya girl scored a cutie. Y’all are so cute!!! Congrats boo!
OMG you two are adorable 🥰
Congrats on the engagement
He is adorable!!!!!  Awww you two!!!  So cute!!!!!
He seems great! You two mesh well together. Thank you for coming on the channel Stewart (maybe not how you spell it). It is nice to get to know you.
You guys are so cute
His Hair and i don’t know his face and skin Colour gives me so much edward cullen and Vampire Vibes 😂😂😂❤️ love seeing you together ❤️
LOVE this! I think Stewart looks like Gregg Sulkin!
Okay so the question we all want to know is are you living together do you have your own place is it somewhere different than the studio we need to know the details :) xx
So cute.  Stuart definitely reminds me of a young Johnny Depp
As a fellow Gemini a have yo say we are very chill people and very caring, I'm glad you find each other congrats on the engagement.
He seems so sweet! , it’s crazy. I’m a Gemini w a Taurus cusp.
Awww, they look great together 🤩 I’m so happy for you Mia I totally loved the video, you guys look made for each other. Wishing you guys the best for your marriage  💞
He looks like if you took Greg Sulkan and Andrew Garfield and smashed them together. (Hope this answer is satisfying)
He looks like joe from you !! Even his outfit in this is spot on haha
I love he opened up towards the end of the video, lovely couple!
Watching this brought me so much joy it made me so happy seeing them together and seeing Mia glow, it really warmed my heart🥺❤️but it’s funny she asked if we thought he looked like a celebrity because that was my first thought when I saw his face he kind of looks like Penn Badgley from the Netflix series “You” but like a younger version
This has made my whole heart happy. Zodiac signs are clearly not always right, you two are perfect! xox  p.s as a Taurus myself, i can definitely tell he’s more Taurus than Gemini ♉️
He totally is 💯 in love with you definitely can see it in the way he looks at you and nice to finally meet you Stuart
Mia’s like my big sister 🥰 so meeting Stuart is like meeting a big sisters boyfriend :) Hes definitely a keeper.
Mia hear me out, you need to do a video of a custom wedding dress following the tips he gave, a satin ball gown with sleeves? Sounds like a princess dress to me.
OMG HE LOOKS LIKE A GEMINI. Joe from you is what I see!!! this is not an insult i love it
He reminded me of Ezra in PLL
YES MIA. TOBEY SUPREMACY
this is literally so cute
He resembles Jackson Rathbone from Twilight!!!
he rly likes his side profile over his front profile so he decided to limit him looking at the camera
You should make a wish wedding dress video
You can always adopt 🙃.
I love him! We approve<3
Waaaay too young for marriage
just what i expected he seems sweet and soft but funny like you. im just happy to see you so happy. dont stress about kids and family for such a long time enjoy love
Pisces and Taurus work well together though. Cusp babies tend to have aspects of both. He could technically identify with that side more if he's truly on the cusp
It's crazy you asked about who he looks like because when the question about Spiderman came up I was thinking Stuart looks like HE could be Peter Parker! Maybe he takes after Tom Holland a tad!  Tell Stuart thanks and we are excited to see him in more videos!
he kinda reminds me of Shawn Mendes for some reason?? idk 😂 you two are so cute together, what an adorable couple ♡ and a video of you baking together would be so amazing haha lots of love xx
more Stuart videos please and thank you
Idk why but he kinda looks like MatPat
Idk but maybe A bit like Penn Badgley idk 🤷‍♀️😂😂😂
Congratulations Mia 👰🍾🍾🍾🥂🥂🥂🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂
He looks like MatPat!!!!
He looks like the YOU guy kinda
Y’all are a good looking couple!
Omg Mia!  I'm a Pisces and my husband is a Gemini!  We make it work though...lol.  Your boo is a doll.  I loved his remark about risky wardrobe with him having an extra button open! How funny! Lololol
I love Stuart's nervousness in the beginning of the video and the "johnny depp" boost towards the end... 🤣🤣...
If Stuart had green/blue eyes he would look like Derek Yates
he definitely looks like Matt Patt from film theory lol!
He's such a sweetheart! Congrats you two!!
Does he look like Joe Goldberg to anyone lol?
I think he looks like Tyson Ritter! Also, congrats to you both on your engagement 🥂
Such a cute couple!
Not a celebrity per se but he looks like Mat Pat from Game Theory 🎮

Mama maples is the least Sagittarius, Sagittarius, that I've ever seen.

hes so cute u did a good job mia
(I am from the Netherlands so forgive me if my English is not fully correct.) It is so fun to finally meet you Stuart (I hope I spelled your name correctly)! The first second I saw you both in the video there was one thought in my head: perfect! You two are perfect for each other!!  Congrats on the engagement, happy new year and I wish you both the most wonderful life you could imagine becouse you two deserve it, and also for the rest of your family and Chip ofcourse!!!  You just gave me a spark of faith in that it all will fall in to place, it will all be okay. (I am having a hard time with being positive and having faith in all kinds of things) you show me a different way of looking to/at life, it can be good. As long as you believe and be positive and learn from your mistakes and that you don't have to be affraid to take a step further, to be there for others but also for yourself, to be happy with the smallest things, to be grateful for the things you have, to not overthink things, to just live in the moment and with full excitement opening doors to the unknown (it sounds like Elsa in Frozen 2😂) and having faith in yourself and others, than it will be okay. Thank you, so much!!! I am so happy for you Mia and Stuart!!! 🤩❤🐶
They look so cute together 💝💙
Gemini and Pisces are absolutely compatible!!! Im a pisces and my #1 best friend  in the whole world is a gemini. Me and her have been best friends for 7 years and we literally have not had one fight the entire time we've been friends...im not kidding. Also so so happy for you Mia!! Im so glad he was willing to do this video, you guys are so cute together <3
He seems so kind and open, but also shy and quiet haha Poor dude must have been so nervous to be in front of a camera.  Congrats on your engagement, Mia & Stewart/Stuart (?)!
I think he looks like MattPat. Especially side profile

So nice to meet you after all this time. Mia I was thinking a few places...no Mia don't make him sweat like that we don't want him to feel pressured lol. You guys are a great couple and it very obvious you have a great relationship. Love that he is getting along with Chip so well, that shows his genuine.

your fiancé reminds me of young Bob Saget
I thought he was Penn Badgley at first.
I don't know why exactly but Stuart reminds me of Bob Saget (R.I.P.) Not his face or anything but he looks like a cool character from the nineteens and has a very calming presence :) Congratulations, you two!
Literally the cutest couple! I am so happy for you Mia :)
You guys go very well together I’m soo glad you found someone I hope to see you both in more videos like maybe if you guys get a house together you can transform it together that would be awesome
I thought he looked like Andrew Garfield tbh but funny enough neither of y'all consider him your fave spidey hahaha
We need a part 2 !!!!!!
Why’s he sorta look like Joe Goldberg
I don't do comments but man this is CUTE
Omg you guys are made for each other🥺 I’ve been here for literally years and years lol. So happy he treats you right ❤️ he looks like a young bob saget
You are so perfect for each other, so much love and laughter between you two. It will sound super corny probably, but I swear it made me believe in love again. Wish you all the happiness, Mia and Stuart ❤
My parents are Gemini and Pisces and just celebrated their 30th anniversary!
He's giving Andrew Garfield actually
Check his rising and moon sign. Just because his sun sign is not compatible with yours does not mean the rest of the chart isn’t ❤️ hope this helps
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Ahhhhh the cringe
.001 seconds into the video I said "OMG she's marrying Edward Cullen!"
He reminds me of Shawn Mendes!!!!!
You are such a beautiful  and cute couple.
I am obsessed with you two!! He did amazing can't wait to see him in your future videos 👏🏼 Also his voice is so calming 😍

You are amazing guys !!!!!! So happy for you ! Loved this video ♥️
First off, this video had me CRACKING UP!!!  Also, My husband would have to agree with your fiancé with the whole “who’s more annoying” situation. I am ALWAYS complaining to my husband about how my body is always falling apart! I am SOOOO glad that I am not the only woman who does this to her other half!! Mia, you and I are so much more alike than I thought! Love you!!! 💕💕💕
He remainders me so much of Joe Goldberg 😅😅😅
So happy for you❤️ Stuart looks sooooo much like Joe Golberg from YOU !!!! Or is it just me heheh

Moa says: "The purpose of the wedding is not to see my dress?"  Lol same 😂
Maybe a mix of actors. I see Andrew Garfield actually and Penn Badgley. Otherwise, no specific actor.

Stuart looks a little like sterling knight from 17 again….. it’s crazy because for some reason that’s how I imagined him in my head!!! When i saw his face at the start I SCREAMED!!! I’ve never correctly imagined someone’s face before like this 🤭
Not sure if YouTubers count as celebrities but he’s a mix of MatPat and the Jack Harries.
Uhmm an app said he looks like Dakota Johnson lmao I mean she's beautiful
Imo, I'd say that Stuart looks a little like Hollywood Hottie Paul Rudd! He seems like a perfect match for ya Mia! 💜
Omg!!!!! You guys are so cuuuute!!! Loved this video and you have a beautiful relationship ❤ Congratulations on your happy ever after (again xD)

He looks British
He looks like Nicholas Hoult or sam claflin a bit imo. Y'all look great together and he seems very sweet.

PLEASE MAKE MORE GLUTEN-FREE BREAD! I'm celiac and struggling
He looks like a Disney Prince. Congrats to you both

Yall are so cute together.... I think he looks like a young Huge Grant from the early 90s!!!
I was watching this again with my wife and I realised that Stewart looks just like the actor who plays superman in superman returns Brendan Routh. He also plays one of the crazy ex's in Scott pilgrim, and is in the DC legends of tomorrow
It seems like you are perfect for each other. Lots of love ;*

Before he sat down and the camera focused he looked like Matpat. lol Way to put Stuart in the hot seat Mia lol. Why did you have to put his Spotify out like that? lol JK love you <3  Your nicknames are adorable btw and don't feel cringe about it :) I too haven't mastered the art of receiving compliments Mia. We can be awkward together.  I love so many Queens too Mia! I literally have a pinterest board full of my favorite queens. lol.  Great video Mia, can't wait to see Stuart in other videos even if he just makes occasional appearances. The Maples Fam is THE BEST and I am so happy to see another member joining.

He gives me Timothée Chalamet and Tom Holland vibes i don't know why 😆

I have an EXTRA button unDONE! Hahahahahaha 🤣
He kinda looks like Henry cavil combined with like Tom Holland or Andrew Garfield (in response to the doppelgänger question ahahah)
they were talking abt andrew garfield, i don’t think it’s a perfect match but he has the same smile and hair!!! ❤️
I think Stuart looks like the brittish actor David Tennant from the side or Mat Patt on YouTube!
you're so perfect for each other! congrats on the engagement ❤
So glad that Stuart was open to being on the channel. He seems sweet just like you with great energy. :) congratulations you two! 🥰
He looks exactly like I pictured him! You both make a beautiful couple ❤️
The good news is, zodiac signs mean nothing so it doesn't matter.
I think I can speak for us all when saying that WE LOVE STEWART!!!!  I see Toby McGuire!!
He is soo cute as like you Mia... Love u as a cute family.. All the best for ur future.. Happy fr u guys 😍...
All the love and happiness your way. You both are perfect together 💗
ALSO stewart looks so much like matpat 😭
it makes me so happy to see you both happy! I'm very excited to see more videos of you both! love you🤍
When you said “as we film more videos” I can just imagine Stewart thinking “I HAVE TO BE IN MOREEEEE?” 😭😂 welcome to the YouTube family Stewart! ❤️
Is it just me or does Stuart kinda looks like Shawn Mendes??????
Sun sign is not enough to base any kind of conclusions. Need at least the moon and ascendant too. Also, I must say you are the cutest together. 🤗🧡🧡🧡
He looks like James Franco!!!! From the original Spider-Man movies! If I had to think of one person Stuart looked like! Lol. I’m so happy for you both! Congratulations!
THIS WAS SO GREAT🙌🏾💖
You can tell you guys have been together for a while bc you say things similarly hahah so cute
He looks like Joe Goldberg from YOU
love and joe sorry
u guys look like love and josh from you
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
He looks like Edward Cullen
Stewart (Stuart?)'s birthday must be May 21, same as mine. Some charts say that I'm a Taurus and others Gemini. Ugh. I say I'm a Gemini but I definitely have some Taurus traits. I won't mention which ones lol
I love your sweater, just had to say that! Also you two are sooo cute together 💖
16:05 HER BACK BOYZ ;) she hitting that chiropractor everyday hope he not blowing it out LMAO
Stuart looks like that guy from Riverdale (?)! I have no idea, I’ve never watched it, But I always see this guy from Riverdale on Netflix. Edit: lmaooo, I’m such a loser. I meant Gregg Sulkin. But he was never in Riverdale. That’s how little I know 🤦🏻‍♀️
First..congratulations on the engagement, and I think it's so awesome that Stuart agreed to finally reveal himself! He seems like a super sweet guy, and y'all are so cute together! For your last question about "does he look like any celebrities"...I thought it earlier in the video and still stand by that to me he looks a lot like Andrew Garfield (Spiderman 2)!
The way he looks at you, I just melted <3 CG MIA <3
According to me his celeb look-alike is Ian Harding, who plays Ezra Fitz in Pretty Little Liars
hes so cute
ahhhh! thank you for introducing all of us! Stuart is wonderful for you!!
Omg ur so cute togetherrrrrrr im so lonely 😭😭
Shawn Mendes
Loved seeing you two together! Such cute little love birds! And to answer your question Mia- I feel like he looks a lot like matpat (not a Hollywood  celeb but it counts!)
I knew your fiancé would be just as great as you are Mia. It's so nice seeing you so happy. He seems like a genuinely good guy! Congrats on the engagement! I can't wait to see him in many more videos to come.
Mia, I had so much respect for him to keep his identity personal. In a world full of cancel culture, hateful comments, psychological damage, stalkers, threats, etc., I can’t imagine why anyone would choose to be on social media. 😞Hoping your man doesn’t get caught up in that crazy world and can live a normal life still. ❤️
you two make such a lovely couple!!! 🥰🥰🥰
I was not planning to comment on this but you specifically asked about lookalikes so Stuart is giving me real MatPat vibes 😅 This was such a cute video though, loved it!
Congratulations on your engagement! You two are a great match.❤️
Is stubby like stuwart + hubby?
Lol he kinda looks like the guy from YOU
Cute
Love him!!!!! Ship you guys so hard. He kinda reminds me of Harry styles.
Mia looks better than ever, healthy, glowing, and super happy!
Mía he’s so hottttt! So happy for youuuu girl you guys are so cute
I felt so happy for you from the very first moment Stuart is on the screen!!! I found myself smiling the entire video, you are so cute together! I mean it's crazy how you finish each other's sandwiches! (If you know what I mean)...  Also for me, Stuart looks like Penn Badgley a little bit)) very handsome
He looks like the main dude from “YOU”
Congratulations! Have a wonderful and happy love filled life we all adore you Mia!
i wish you guys a happy life together! ya'll deserve it:) Lots of love from The Netherlands xx
I swear I was smiling throughout the whole video!! The way you guys look at each other just shows how much love there is between you❤️ Stewart we appreciate you and I’m so happy to meet you!!
They are looking so cute together ❤  and he is also looking at her in so passionate in her love ❤ 😍
he's so cute Mia!!!
The celebrity question had me thinking until I remembered — Colin Morgan! I see some resemblance but that could also just be the fact that I'm currently binging Merlin so yeah 🙊
Stuart looks identical to David Tenant!! Definitely his doppelgänger
you two are so cute!! i’m honestly so happy for you guys, i couldn’t stop smiling throughout the video, I LOVE YOU BOTH and i wish the best for both of you🥰
You two are perfect together.  Congratulations again.
Joe from you! In a good way tho, he’s beautiful
tom holland resembles stuart
He looks like Penn badgley ( from “you” on Netflix)
He reminds me of an adorable mix of Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland.   I love you two
I don’t think your fiancé necessarily looks like the actor that plays the character, but in this video he’s giving me Edward from Twilight vibes. Anybody agrees? 😊
Love this sm, you can tell you guys have so much love for each other <3 i think he looks a bit like andrew garfield and robert pattinson!
For your zodiac sign I wanna tell u that vedic astrology have different dates ( I find it more accurate ) and according to those dates your fiance can actually be Taurus while you aquarius. Vedic dates For Taurus - May 15 - June 14 For aquarius- Feb 12 - March 12  Also through vedic astrology you can check your entire compatibility ( nor like it's important just saying ,you two look adorable together anyways ) 😊
How can I NOT watch you two friggen cute love birds 🕊 genuinely a dove has such a beautiful spiritual meaning & it’s beautiful he sees that in YOU 💫💫💫 if it wasn’t an animal he’d probably say you’re an angel 😇 im a Gemini ♊️ & we get far too much hate lol stop it (that’s my Scorpio 🌝 talking sorry not sorry😘🙊). Gotta keep that Taurus energy a lil 🌶 because you love diving into new avenues too 💗🌞 blesssingssssss to you both 💫💫💫💫💫
I'm a Pisces and my fiancé is also a Gemini! 😂 We're getting married in October.

If Stuart had longer/curly hair he would definitely give Timothée Chalamet vibes
I'm so happy for you Mia!!! He is so sweet and it looks like he adores you! Wishing you guys all the happiness in the world.

Okay but I was sitting here thinking he looks like Penn Badgley the whole time. Is it just me?
He seems so sweet and kind. He looks like Penn badgley, from gossip girl.
You guys are so cuteeeeeee❤️
Awwww ♡
He's so gentle and romantic! Mia, you are such a beautiful human and I wish you and Stuart the very best. I met my husband 17 years ago and we knew very early-on that we were right together. ❤️
Hes kinda giving Edward Cullen if he were human lol
You guys are so cute! 😍😭
He definitely resembles Joe from "You" but in the best way possible!!! Love you Mia

From the side he looks a bit like MatPat - not sure if he’s considered a celebrity 😂😂
So niceeeee. Love it!
HE IS SO FINE
You guys are so cute 🥺🥺🥺 welcome stubby! 😂
The way he looks at Mia because he's a little uncomfortable and looking at her helps him 🥺🥺
his doppelgänger is RT Mitte (walter jr) from breaking bad hair and face are so similar
While watching this my dad asked if he was Edward from twilight😂😂
Not exactly a celebrity but you guys look like the American version of fleurdeforce and Mike 😂
This moment when you watch this as an European person and the video is marked as that it trends in your country xDD

He looks like a firefighter from Chicago fire his name is jimmy
HE LOOKS LIKE MATTPATT
Definitely looks like a version of Shawn Mendes ❤
Pray to the Reptilian King, for He is your Lord and Savior. Hiss!
Stuart seems like such a nice guy! As for the celebrity look-alike question, while I don't think he looks like Robert Pattinson, he does look almost exactly how I imagined Edward Cullen to look when I read Twilight in middle school (i.e.: pale with really good hair.)
I couldn't stop smiling! Steward you were amazing! Wishing all the best to you two <3
MatPat... He looks a LOT like MatPat
The teeth on these two are spectacular!
Cutest video ever! The way you look at each other, omg I wish!!!😩 But answering your question Mia…I think he look like a mix between Jacob Elordi and Shawn Mendes :) Probably just me thinking that lol
why am I getting Andrew Garfield vibes!?!?
You guys r such a cute couple!  Congrats again on ur engagement ❤️❤️
HE IS SO CUTE WHEN HE LOOKS AT YOUUUU
Cusps aren’t a thing. Look at the rest of your charts, like moon and venus 🙃
so cute! he looks like a young ian harding
In my opinion his celebrity look alike is Steven R. McQueen (Jeremy Gilbert from Vampire diaries) but when I saw Stuart I felt like I’ve seen him before so there is onother celebrity that looks just like him even more than Steven but I dunno who it could be..
is it just me or does Stuart kinda look like Penn Badgley?
First of "mia" in mama maples voice while giving you the side look, he's perfect for you!  Stuart: you're amazing for coming on a video and overcoming fear! You did amazing!
Justin Trudeau!!
definitely Shawn
Yes to the baking video!!!!
Anyone else getting young Zack Braff vibes?
The lead singer of all American rejects! Also, amazing to meet you! You're both adorable 🤭❤️

TOTALLY CUTE…..ADORABLE…….and you seems so happy together!!!  BEST of all, you obviously LIKE each other very much!  That, is more important than the romantic feelings and even than love as it is the basic support of a good relationship! !  Appreciating and genuinely admiring each other is critical to a long and happy marriage/relationship!!!  It was fun getting to meet Stuart and to see you together!  He seems like a nice guy who truly thinks Mia is as special as her viewers find her to be!  I am very happy for you both and for your family! Honestly, if Mia’s parents are all for Stuart, than that is an absolute seal of approval!  Stuart, Thank you for showing your face…and your really excellent smile!!
Stuart/Stewart could totally be a younger Robert Pattinson!
Aw he seems so sweet ❤️ it would be fun to see a video with Stewart and Mama Maples together!
Adorable....You guys just fit. Two people from one mold. I love your relationship and so glad Stuart decided to join the Maples Community! Can't wait to see you both in future videos! Love it.
Congratulations Mia, I’m so happy for you!! Looking forward to all the upcoming wedding videos 🥰

OMGosh, I am 70 and let me say, not only is he really nice to look at he has class and manly grace. You 2 as everyone else is saying look so good together. Thank you Stewart for agreeing to be under the microscope to all of Mia's followers. She is well loved and tho you have your family and now her family,  you have the people she makes feel like family out here as well. Edit-He's funny too, dang!
DUDE MIA. GO YOU!! Picked a winner. He looks at you like the QUEEN you are. I am so happy you are happy and wow I’m just starstruck for you! So cute
Love that this video is trending 💜 you guys deserve to be celebrated!
OMG QUEEN UR TRENDING
He was AMAZING! Y’all are so cute 🥰 and he looks like Spider-Man (Tobey)!
For the zodiac signs, it's always good to look at your entire Birthchart. Just because your sun signs aren't compatible doesnt mean too much you have a whole personality and so many other parts of you. Look at your birth charts and Venus Signs. That should tell you more
From the side I feel like he resembles MatPat from Game Theory!
This is how I imagine Edward Cullen.
Hello Stewart little !!!🥰 welcome welcome
SO SO SO HAPPY for you guys omg
I love y’all together already you guys are so freaking cute!!!!!
He is endeared to us now. I found myself smiling the entire video, I wish you both all the best

A YOUNG HARRY CONNICK JR. OR RJ MITTE (Walter White Jr. from Breaking Bad)! Congrats you two!
as soon as i saw him, i was like “he looks like Matpat”
Such a cute couple. He gives me Andrew Garfield vibes for a celebrity lookalike.
Mia I am so happy for you!! And thank you Stuart for letting us meet you! You guys look so perfect🖤
So happy for you both! You should do a full birth chart compatibility test, as cusps are a bit of a myth. He probably has strong Taurus placements! ❤️
Awe he is so cute & you guys are adorable together! So happy for you guys!! 💓 Side note, look up your moon rising & ascending signs it gives you a bigger picture just fyi.
TOBY!
Your fiancé is super cute and you both are really lucky to have each other😍

Petition for Mia and Stuart to wear a Rapunzel and Eugene cosplay!

Toby McGuire

He is a keeper Mia! You guys are so amazing together!❤️🌺
Firstly you guys are great together. Secondly I think Stuart looks like Ben Barns.

He looks like Shawn Mendes omo
He looks like me brother.
Awww yay that's so great much thanks to him! Yall are sooo cute!
This was a very sweet videos 😊. I can totally relate to Mia's stance on kids. I wanted a large family, but then I had a kid and I was like, nope, only willing to do that once more 😅.
Stewart is sooooo cute!💞  You guys are cuteee. Also, he looks like Chris Evans from the side angle 😍
He looks a lot like Mattpat

My gosh. I love you two. Thank you for sharing Stewart with us Mia. You guys are Adorable, you both seem So happy, I love it
Get you a man that looks at you the way Stuart looks at Mia. 😭😭😭
I LOVE Derrick Barry
He’s cute and lovely and I’m so happy for you  Also birth month means very little alone, so he may be a Gemini but he also has many other placements, same with you. My friend is super into this stuff so I don’t know a ton but if you are curious you should do a full star chart test (birth time and place)
lmao why this shit on trend,the thirsty tiktok mf's really came to yt
Awwww hiii! So happy to meet Stuart!
Lowkey he reminds me Joey Bragg, but more french
You guys are so adorable.. ❤️❤️ Idk why but the moment I saw him I thought of Edward Cullen..
He reminds me of the guy who hosted blues clues.
Oh my god you are a perfect looking couple! 🥰
Hey Mia what kind of phone do you have?
Your story kinda reminds me of my own love story... We went to the same high school and the first time I saw him I thought he was SO fine but was too shy to ever talk to him. Fast forward 5 years. I meet a mutual friend at a party, mention to him that I was interested in his friend in high school. Of course word got back to him which got him curious about me. His birthday was days later and I knew I just had to see him again. I felt way more confident having grown out of my awkward phase. I was ready to catch me a Cado! And I did. It's cliche, but it was practically instant love. There was a moment, he was leaving to go to the movies with his dad and I was walking down the stairs and he locked eyes with me and would NOT look away. His birthday marks our anniversary because we were basically inseparable from that day forward. It's been 14 years this last December 29th. We have a son together and still could not imagine life without one another, and are more in love now than ever before! That's how you know it's true love- it continues to grow even after so many years have passed. I wish the same for Mia and Stuart! Congrats, and good luck!
Does he look like any celebs? Yes, he looks like a joe goldberg, 100%
Girl you're trending!!! This was a great video and I'm so happy that you are happy. He seems so gentle and loving.
"I have an extra button undone".  The best line.
he radiates major joe goldberg vibes but in a good way lmao. y’all are adorable together
AHHH you guys are so cute had me smiling the whole video!!💗💗 loved that you included your moms reaction 😂
I think he low key looks like a more prim and proper Shawn Mendes👌🏻
I LOVEEEEEE HIM MIA! For so long I couldn’t visualise what your boyfriend would look like but know I see him. He is perfect for you and you him!!❤️❤️❤️
He might be a Taurus for his moon sign or rising, and traits of those signs can show more significantly than traits of his sun sign Gemini

It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

You both seem so perfect for each other!! So happy for you Mia 💖💖💖
You guys are so cute! Thank you for sharing Stewart with us! 💗
So glad he came on!!
You REALLY threw him into the deep water, didn't you? 😅  Very warm video, thank you!  About the doppelganger question: don't know if he counts as a celebrity, but maybe the YouTuber MatPat 😳
Does he look a little bit like andrew garfield or am i tripping?
Omg so nice to meet him! Already loved him from your proposal story but he is so great! I’m so happy for both of you!
Yall are soulmates I'm so happy for you🥰
He is so cute!!!
Hahahahahahhahahaahah I’M DEAD  and feel so called out “who do we have to attend more to… I mean your back, your hip…”. I literally herniated 3 discs this year at 27, and I’m sure my boyfriend would name my back as the first reason I am high maintenance too, Mia😅. Seriously though Sawyer seems super sweet, thanks for taking a fashion risk with us, the extra button is magnificent!
He kinda looks like Timothy Shalamay (don't know how to spell his last name lol)
he definetly has a resemblance to Danny from Full house
"hi, I put my entire life on youtube, and am probably getting married for yt hits, i'm super attention whorey, please pay attention to my life and praise me!" no.

MIA as soon as he showed his face I said “Wow he kind of looks like John Krasinski” hahah then you asked to comment which celebrity he looks like😆 so happy to meet Stewart and so happy for the two of you Congratulations!❤️
Stuart gives me major Robert Pattinson as Edward in Twilight vibes. 😍
14:18 i was planning on telling my crush about my feelings for him for a long time but i had second thoughts. I'm going to tell him tomorrow Mia wish me luck 😭😭😭😭😭
He actually looks like Andrew Garfield!
Somehow he looks like a combination of every single Spider-Man idk
Hi Mia you guys are so perfect for each other!💜 I think his celebrity lookalike is Gregg Sulkin!!!!
He looks like joe ! 😍😂 from YOU ob Netflix
I think he looks like mason greyback who was the werewolf from wizards of waverly place!!!!!!

Few GOOD things summed up:  1: everyone, find yourself someone who looks at you like how Stewart looks at Mia! 2. It’s fun to see how you guys have the exact same humor.  3. The respect that Stewart has towards Mia is amazing!  Loved this video!  My best, from Holland👏🏼

I’m sitting here grinning the whole time! 💓 So happy for you two, great video!
Congrats to you both!!! He is a trooper for doing that video with you, since it’s not his thing. Celebrities- I would say he looks like a young Liam Neeson 🧐

I'm sorry but I laughed so hard when I guessed he was a Gemini before Mia revealed it , I am a Gemini too and he   looks like me when I get introduced in an awkward situation.  And his smile 🙂 hahahahaha I could totally relate, it was fun to watch.  I'm sorry Mia but he is totally a Gemini 😂♊
Awkwardddddddddd
Omg such a cute couple
Nice to meet you Stuart!!! It must have been so nerve racking to be put in the spotlight... Don't worry most of the world are good people and most of them follow Mia!!! Thank you for introducing yourself to us!!
Crazy stuff... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SbPyXgOBbE
HE LOOKS SO NERVOUS HAHAHA YOU BOTH ARE ADORABLE😭😭😭😭🤍
He kind of looks like Penn Badgley (probs spelt that wrong)
Hi
He obviously is a Penn Badgley look alike.  You guys are great together. I hope he isn’t too overwhelmed with the experience.
the way he looks at you stoppppp
Wait! My fiancé is a Gemini and I’m a Pisces. My grandparents are also the same. My grandpa is a Gemini and my grandma is a Pisces. They’ve been married for nearly 60 years.
He looks like the guy from You. So happy for you two!
Aww I’m in the video 🙉  You’re adorable! Love the way you look at each other ❤️ wishing you the best
Mia, don't worry about childbirth! Yes, it hurts. You're vulnerable. You're on an emotional roller coaster. I BEGGED my mom to shoot me and put me out of my misery! 😳 When it was finally time to push, I was exhausted. I just wanted to give up. But let me tell you this. Even 24 hours of labor was SOOOOO WORTH IT!! The love and awe when you first see your baby, indescribable!! All that pain is instantly forgotten! I wanted 5 babies! I loved pregnancy and loved my little babies. Sadly, I lost 2 babies and had 2 babies. After my losses, I was advised that having another baby could kill me. But I'm so blessed with the 2 that I have! You'll be an amazing mother!  Also, Stuart seems to fit in to your family so perfectly! Some of his voice inflection reminded me of Mama Maples! I love that he loves your family so much! Have a very blessed union!
Idk why but they look like twin😍😍
I hope he feels welcome here and not nervous anymore. Mia has gathered a following of really lovely people. Everybody on your family seems to have a heart made of pure gold.
I’m a gemini and my husband is also a pieces!! Don’t listen to what the internet says😂😂
They are gonna make the most beautiful babies! pale as can be babies, but absolutely beautiful! 🤣   Seriously tho. Congratulations! You both seem very happy and content together
stuart’s doppelgänger: gigi goode out of drag 😎
Ezra from pretty little liars
Are you two religious?
Wow the video is trending now 🎉
He kinda looks like Edward from twilight but also he doesn't 😂. I don't know! Also you guys are so cute together .You are otp for suree❤️
He looks like the actor that plays the British werewolf guy from wizards of waverly  place 🙃
He's so cuuuute He looks like a proper movie heartthrob! Over the moon for you both ❤️ thanks for coming on YouTube so that our nosiness is satisfied!  Also I was thinking the whole time that he reminds me of Robert pattinson when he was in Harry potter Not super identical but very similar vibes

I’m a Gemini. My ascendant is Taurus and I’ve been on a very long relationship with a Pisces. You guys are fine. Congratulations 🤍💜
My bf is a taurus and he is very similar to  Stuarts vibe! Pisces and Taurus match very well 😉 😇
You guys are so cute together! I would say if Tom Cruise and Rami Malek had a baby, that would be Stuart lol at least that is what I see.
Nice to finally meet your fiance. He seems like a really great guy and I'm happy for you both that you have each other. He did an excellent job I could definitely tell he was nervous but hey I would be super nervous too. 💜
https://youtu.be/bmDPRHSDMrM
Such a lovely couple!! Stuart gives of strong Edward from Twilight vibes and looks like Robert Pattinson too. 🥰
He looks like a very nice guy
He reminded me of Andrew Garfield actually. Lol
You guys look so cute together... 🙂
He is HOT!!
He's sooooo cute!!! :)
I have 3 possible ideas for celebrity look alikes! 1. Ian Harding 2. Gregg Sulkin 3. Penn Badgley I’m so happy for you both! It was really sweet seeing you too interact finally and how caring you are for each other.
Omg he's trending! Lol so nice to meet him! Happy for you guys!
OMG FINALLY! you two look so great together :'D Ngl i was smiling the whole time while watching this ALSO  i think he kinda looks like Jacob Elordi because from the beginning of the video i was like "he looks like someone!!" but thats just me tho, others might think differently heh. lots of love to you both!!
Yes Mia about the astrology! My man is a Sagg which usually wouldn't get along with me (Virgo) but he has a Capricorn stellium in his chart which totally wins me over 💕 you guys are so cute together!
For me it’s Tom Holland Tobey is good for sentimental value. He played a good spider man. But he didn’t fit Peter Parker Andrew played a good Peter Parker but wasn’t the best spider man.  Tom fits both extremely well. He plays a great Peter AND a great Spider-Man.
Stuart looks like a mixture of all the Spider-Man’s
I’m a Pisces and my girlfriend is a Gemini 😂
He kinda looks like Mat pat ..u two are adorable 💖💖💖💖
You guys are so cute together and i wish you all the best with your upcoming wedding!! To answer your question on what celebrity Stuart looks like, he looks similar to young  Bob Saget from Full house
Bob saget! That’s who he reminds me of. Like a young handsome bob. Lol
Awww..the way he looks at you throughout the whole video is soooo cute...🥰I hope my fiance also looks at me like that...Oh wait he does🤭🥰
“I have an extra button undone” 😂 omgilovethis
omg he is freaking handsome....my jaw drooped ...he...m cute jealous seeing ur fiancee...
Omg he’s such a cutie!! I love this video! So happy he decided to do it and that we’ll see him in future videos ❤️
Is it normal to get married so young in Canada? Average age in Ireland is 36 for men and 34 for women.
You did such a good job! He is a cutie, Mia!
Stewart 100% looks like he could be a fourth Spider-Man from one of the multiverses
He looks like a mixture between MatPat and Andrew Garfield
Awww you guys are so cute. I'm so happy for you mia ❤
Hahaha my god!!! My ex was a Pisces and I’m a Gemini 😅😅
Stuart low key looks like Grant Gustin right?
Awe my goodness he is so cute.... You guy look precious together. ❤
Awww he looks good 👍 and u both look very cute 😍 💕 together ❤ gbu 💖 both

He’s literally MatPat’s twin 😂 so happy for y’all ♥️
Oh the way they look into each others eyes.... This is the most wholesome video ❤
Welcome to the fam (I mean us who have followed Mia for a while now) This video made me smile and laugh. You are very sweet together and I can't wait to see more from both of you. ☺

You guys just look like you would be married, so cute and natural together!!❤️
Ahhhh what a perfect match x
Stuart, you are taking OUR girl, you better treat her the best that you could, because our eyes are on you!!
Probably a weird observation, to me, he radiates the same vibe and energy as Mama Maples.  P.S. I wrote this before the Horoscope bit and  Mama Maples'  reaction. It was just my first impression of him. Turns out I was right. 😊
We are having fun!!!!!
Young Bob Saget 😁
Oh my God you two are so adorable together God bless you both ❤
He looks like MatPat
He looks like young Bob saget!!
They're extremely adorable ❤️❤️❤️
I'm dying! The story about Stuart giving mama maples a  necklace with a diamond from Mia's ring is so sweet! Gave me chills!
You should do a who knows me better with your mom and your fiancé. I think it would be interesting to see their relationship with each other on screen
You're so adorable guys 😍. May God bless and protect your relationship ❤😘
Welcome, Stuart!
I literally created a YouTube account ( I usually just use my husband's) to like a second time and comment that you two look sooooo cute together!!!! I love how softspoken he is, and he looks at you like you're his universe. And the stars in your eyes and your giggles say it all! Congratulations on your engagement!!
He just reminds me so much of Joe from YOU
I think his doppelganger is Flynn Ryder and shawn Mendes mixed.
Stuart does kind of look like Jonny Depp, like a Johnny Depp X Andrew Garfield mix 💀
The celebrity thing he looks like a mix of young bob saget and Jacob elordi
I gasped when you say he was a gemini he surely don’t act at all like a gemini !
I think he looks like Tyson Ritter or RJ Mitte. Love you guys ☺
I am an Aquarius, my husband is a Taurus. According to every source I've ever read, we are among the least compatible matches in the zodiac... Yet we have been married for going on 14 years, and together for around 17. It's true, we are completely opposite in nearly every way. But for some reason it just works for us. I can't imagine life without him. 🖤
Awe you guys are so cute! Congratulations on the engagement!
My parents were both a Pisces and Gemini and they were married for 40 years before my dad passed! They work well together!
I always imagine mia is like a disney princess.. N LOOK u found ur price charming.. Im so happy for u.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍🇲🇾
He looks similar to Joe from You.
My first thought was that he looked like John Mayer.
He looks like Ezra from PLL
Omg the jujutsu kaisen username HAHAHA omg I’m so happy for y’all!!! Thank you Stuart for sharing with us ☺️
Omg he is adorable and they make the cutest couple!
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like the guy from the show “YOU”!!!!
4.18 Stuart figiting because he's nervous, we can't see it cause it's off camera, Mia just calls him on it laughing. Love it 🤣🥰
He looks like Andrew Garfield
respectfully is fine !
he looks like matpat
You both look so cute together 🥰🥰🥰
So so happy to meet you Stuart! The energy between you two is just unmatched 🌟 I see a little bit of Gregg Sulkin in you!
JOE FROM YOU HE LOOKS LIKE JOE FROM YOU lol and you could be a long-haired Beck
Omg love you guys so freakin much! 😍😍
You two are adorable together.
OMG he's so fricking cute! Welcome to the fam, Stuart! :D
Stuart reminds me so much of my brother in law! A great man, you look so happy together 🥰 he reminds me of Penn Badgley mixed with Noah Schapp maybe?
You both are so cute ❤️ Idk, why I am  excited for your wedding but I am 🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Ngl, Stuart looks like Mat Pat.
So adorable. Perfect!!!!!!!
Okay can someone please draw them like Disney characters? You guys are so cute!
Loved Stuart! He kind of reminds me of Shiloh Fernandez (Red Riding Hood). Also make sure he knows we won’t mind if he doesn’t want to be in other videos, we respect his privacy 💜
He kinda looks like Andrew Garfield...I taught about it cause you talk about him when was the spidey question, so yeah...he kinda does
Stuart you have nothing to worry about! Loved seeing you in a video, you're cool. Btw having an extra button undone is very risky but you pulled it off 😎
Is he older than him? Cause he doesn't seem that old Anyway I am so happy for Miaaaa,you are actually so sweet and he is looks like  he is deserving her 💗
idk but he kind of slightly reminds me of Linguini from Ratatouille 😊
This video makes me feel so warm and happy inside ❤️❤️
He is adorable!  You are perfect match for each other and I´m happy for you 😊🥰 Btw Stuart looks like Ian Harding in 2010 😁😅
Mia your boyfriend looks like the German actor Jannis Niewöhner. You guys can go check it out 😜
he is so cute
Timothee Charlemet with a little Penn Badgley
about your last question, i think he looks a bit like shawn mendes? LOL loved the video, as always, you are great <3
Stuart looks like Joe Goldberg from YOU 👀✨🤭
My favorite creator 😌 she deserves happiness and that’s so cool 🙂🙂🙂
He looks like he could play spiderman. Reminds me of Andrew Garfield
YOU GUYS ARE EVERYTHING 🖤 but he definitely looks like JOE from YOU 😭  (PENN BADGLEY)
the whole video my fiance and i were talking about adorable you guys are together!! but at the end when you asked what celeb look alike he has, my fiance said “edward cullen bc hes so pale”
You should watch spanish drag race, it's great
No context for why you call him Stubby? 😅 Is it a beard thing?
Does he have a tiny little bit of a French accent or is that just his Canadianishness?   He seems like a very sweet boy, Mia, and the way he looks at you...beautiful.
He looks like the main character of show "You" 💕
I love what he brings out in you, you seem so comfortable and fearless. It's beautiful.
I totally get the non-gemini thing.  My Dad was 21st May and for years he said he was Gemini - but he was - like Stuart - way too calm to be a gemini - I did his chart and he was a Taurus (like me) - I  told him - he says - No- the newspapers etc say Gemini so I must be - I'm like -  Dad - the fact you're arguing about it is sooo Taurus.  Stuart definitely gives Taurus vibes.
I love you ❤️😘
How cuuute♥️♥️♥️
He may have a different moon sign that makes him more grounded (my mom is a Gemini with a Capricorn moon) and either way it's a lot more than just your sun sign :)
They both are basically like mama maples and daddy maplessss oh goshhh exactly
So so so cute. So happy for you guys!
So cute couple 😍 Hoping for more couple videos for the both of you
In the middle of the video, I found myself thinking, "If I had to compare him to a fictional character from a movie, it would be Michael from Princess Diaries."
Mia you asked for a celebrity lookalike and I feel Stuart looks alot like Penn Badgley the actor from You and Gossip Girl. And this video just looks like Dan and Serena in a frame ♥️
Yay!! So glad Stuart finally wanted to be on the channel!! Was so nice to meet him and can’t wait to see him in more videos !! 💕
He looks like Greg sulkin aka mason from wizards of Waverley place
He's Shawn Mendes.
His voice is PERFECT for ASMR.
Hey. You look great with Mia. I hope you two have a great life together ahead.❤️❤️
I think he looks like this swedish youtuber Emil Hansius, does he? Or is it just me? https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCegpk2mYI9JRiVP8GYhrvjQ
Omg perfect couple
YOUR FIANCES NAME IS NOT MY DADS NAME OH NOOOOOOOOO I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO LOOK AT HIM THE SAME WAY NOW. Side note: you two are super cute oh my, congrats and I love you both!
I literally smiled through this whole video hahaha. So happy for you guys 🥺
You two are so cute together 😍 and he kinda reminds me of Edward/Robert Pattinson from twilight
I'm so happy we got to meet Stuart 🥰 Also for the celeb doppelganger, can we all agree Ian Harding is pretty close?
You should do a baking/cooking completion. Like have the same ingredients but a partition in between the both of you and see what you guys cook and get mama maples to blind judge xx
Is it stewerd or stuart
In terms of looking like a celebrity, I feel like I don't know enough male celebrities to say butttt I do see that if Kirsten Stewart had a brother, he would like stuart hahah
he is sooo adorable!!! you guys are soooo adorablleeeee ommmggggg the way he looks at you ughhhh goals🤎🤎🤎
Nice to meet you Stewart. You.did great. and many congrats on your engagement 💝
I'm so happy for you Mia, you look so happy and confident with him ! I just smiled the entire time of the video, you're very cute and have so much chemistry ! You two are defo best friends, and that's exactly how I see love and relationships : a partnership with much laughs :D
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am screaming 🥰😱
Okay but I am getting jacob elordi vibes from him!!!
He looks like a cool dude, love him already.
That “this isn’t risky enough; I have an extra button undone” was just the highlight lol.
He reminds me of Joe Goldberg from you but in the sweetest way, there is. Just give him a baseball cap 🧢😂  or maybe it was because he was wearing a blue Shirt Idk so Penn Badgley I guess. But he seems sweet and you guys are beautiful together. I was smiling through the whole video.
I never comment but OMG the entire time I kept thinking of there was a 4th jonas brother it would be him and then u asked at the end! You make a really lovely couple & you couldn’t take your eyes off each other and that was lovely to see !
OMG I'm a Gemini and my boyfriend is a Pisces! lol
he looks like timothée chamalat
He's giving me Ezra Fitzgerald vibes from PLL 😄 you guys are so cute together!😍🥰

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa doooooooooooooooooor aaaaaaaableeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Lmaooo i love how you mentioned that with the zodiac Mia and mum aren't supposed to get along and neither with Gemini and yet if there's a disagreement, stuart is on mums side... i dno... lol pretty accurate to me, just not to the extent we assume in our minds when the zodiac is described that way, definitely can work on becoming compatible
You two look sooooooooo cute together!!!!😍😍😍😍😍

#LastQuestion Stuart looks like the live impersonation of Luigi from Ratatouille. I mean that in a totally good way too. His nose especially fits the role well. And I know you said celebrities, but Luigi is a really well known character. Best of luck and love to both of you 😚♥️👍
He looks like Joe in You😶
Young Bob Saget

14:49 that mhmm Stuart did was soo cute
Mia is a bad influence. I used to wear dresses and cute rompers as loungewear, but now I am obsessed with hoodies and sweatpants 😂
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!! Smiling from the intro to end!!
Love your dynamic, I can tell you guys are a great fit.  For a Stuart clone I would a mix between Steven R. Mcqueen and John Francis Daley.
i think stuart looks like a mix between kit harington and timothee chalamet
We’re gonna protect Stuart at all cost Mia he’s a gem🥰
I see that no one is really answering the doppelgänger question but I think Stuart looks like MatPat, or if Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland had a baby.
He is soooo shyyy
I don't see Stuart looking like any celebrities I know, but Mia kind of gives me Karen Gillian vibes. You two are so cute <3
❤️
OMG love the way he looks at you <3 love you both  God Bless
Can i get a shout out please 🙏
Edward Cullen!!!!!!!
Tom Holland
Mama Maples laughter is gold! 😁♥️
I met tayce 's aunt who raised him at a bar I worked at in the uk she was full on about him but you could tell the love was there
Awwww you both are adorable together 💕 I’m so happy for both of you. Welcome to the channel Stuart !!!
Why did I get a Liberty Mutual Spider-Man add during the Spidey question?
Stuart - You know we are only judging you to make sure our girl is being taken care of, right? That said, if Mama Maples loves you, we love you! As for a celebrity look alike, I am going with Ben Feldman :)

Omg I loves him 🥰 Hi Stewart 👋 Welcome to Mia's youtube family. Nice to finally meet you! You guys seem like a great match. Speaking as a Taurus who dated a Pisces for 7yrs (longest relationship for us both - and we're still good friends), I think you will have a long happy life together. He seems to fit into the Maples family perfectly. Brownie points for choosing Toby and Tom as favorite Spiderman lol. Can't wait for more videos of you two ♥️  Ps - now that you mention it, he's totally giving me slight Bob Saget vibes lol... maybe... possibly? But that might be because I'm weird and Bob literally JUST passed away (RIP Bob 🕊)

So I was quite surprised that you got engaged so quickly 🙉 But because your lives are different than ours and you look so amazing together I completly understand now 💖 AND I AM SOOOO HAPPY FOR YOU 😘
I'm also a non-gemini Gemini with a Cancer moon and Scorpio rising 🥲

I can't stop smiling while watching this video <3

Wow! Me and my bf met at volleyball too and we had seen each other when we were kids and we just got engaged a few months ago and we’re 23 🥰 so many similarities! Crazy!
He is adorable!  You are so good together.
He looks like a younger version of Johnny Depp, BUT i think he has similarity with Penn Badgley. <3
So excited to finally meet him!!! ❤️❤️❤️You guys look so good together 🤭
He looks like *Mat Pat, from the channel The Film Theorists* .
Doppelgänger: early days Bombay bicycle club singer jack Steadman. Look at the photos when he was younger though lol. I also have watched his interviews and I thought maybe the demeanor was also making me think they were similar.
Please take care of our Mia.🤧
Thank you for doing the video Stuart. You’re as adorable as Mia. 💖💖
Look into vedic astrology. In vedic astrology he probably is a Taurus
He looks like a Disney prince and we all know you’re a Disney princess you guys deserve each other so much 😭
Good  job mia🧚‍♀️✔💗
you both look soooo goood together
Awww you both are so cute and perfect together <3 Wishing you lots of love and joy for your future together!!!
His hair is perfect
We all know Mia would be a Golden Retriever.
Andrew Garfield!!!
The love was felt through the screen. I couldn't stop smiling as I kept thinking how perfect you guys are for each other. Another wholesome video <3
❤
I think Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield and a tad bit like Evan Peters but with better brows and more lips. Hmmm he also looks like someone else but I can't put my finger on it
Great couple. Celeb lookalike = young Rupert Everett... That hair though 10/10
can't stop thinking about how he looks kinda like matpat
The way he looks at mia 🥺🥰🥰
You guys are so cute, can't wait to see Stuart relax on the channel and get to know him better. I just wanted to give him a hug and tell him its totally fine! 🤗
MY FAVE ARE ADORE DELANO, BOB THE DRAG QUEEN, DERRICK BERRY. So many so hard to choose!
1 minute in and i’m screaming because how cute you guys are 😩💓
Dan from Gossip Girl
You two are so cute together!! ❤️ I think Stuart kinda resembles Dan from Gossip Girl. Like some of the expressions are very similar and also I think the eyes look similar.
Ahhhh we love him!!
Ommmgggggg I'm cryingggggggg🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧚‍♀️😭
Welcome to the family hahaha Thank you for sharing your happiness with everyone !! As a long time watcher of this Chanel I’m beyond glad Mia has found love. She has brought a lot of laughter to my life but also helped me heal. I lost my mom a few years ago and watching Mia with her mom and family reminds me of my mom and my family. It always makes me smile.  I remember showing my mom any video you put your mom in because how much you guys reminded me of us.  I genuinely wish the best for you guys as well as your family!!! Thank you for sharing your beautiful sole with the world.
DO STUART’S BIRTH CHART!!! Let’s see how Gemini he really is!
The spidey questions made me realize how totally Stuart looks like someone who would play Peter Parker in a movie. He just has that face of a Peter Parker lol anyone else agree with me XD
im also a gemini taurus cusp (we prob. have similar bdays lol) and my bf is a pieces and it's a perfect match so I get it<3
At first i was slightly concerned of hearing you were getting married so young but Mia…i see it!!! I SEE IT. He seems so freaking kind, sweet and genuine! Plus he listened to the kooks and doja cat? It’s a Yes from me!
when you said you guys were not compatible I knew he was a gemini hahahaha!!!! The worst match, I am a pisces myself! But not necessarily always true lolol stewart seems nice
He is a perfect match for Mia! Loved meeting him...he is such a sweet person!!
If you go back in time he really looks like Ricky Nelson & speaks like him as well. Also looks like Andrew Garfield & Timothee Chalamet & Penn Badgley. Phew!!! What a nice young man you have chosen to wed!! You seem to be a great match made in heaven!!!
Tayce and Bimini forever ❤️❤️❤️
Mia- check his moon and rising. So I'm an astrologist. I knew you were a Pisces- by your eyes, but anyways; most people depending on certain factors tend to be more their moon or rising side. Your moon is your emotional side. I'm a Virgo rising, Cancer Moon, Pisces Rising.
Wow, this video is literally tending. 👀
PUT ME ON YOUR VOLLEYBALL TEAM
You guys are adorable ❤
For the record I was immediately like wow the ✨Taurus energy ✨
THIS MAN- the way he looks at you. Like we knew with the ring story but omg Mia. He fits you so well. You are soulmates. I love it I love your love. Hey there Stuart! You're a very handsome man, and the way you love our girl, it means the world to us. Thank you so much for meeting us, Stuart. Come as you are, we are all so loving and are so excited to meet you! 🖤
he kinda looks like Penn Badgley!! (joe goldberg). :))) 😁
How cute!! ❤️
HE DEFINITELY LOOKS A LOT LIKE MATPAT FROM GAME THEORY/ FILM THEORY/ THE FOOD THEORY/ GTLIVE !!! BUT I THINK MATPAT IS MORE OBNOXIOUS
What’s funny is as soon as he showed his face, I thought he could be apart of the Cullens and then you asked at the end who he looks like 🤣 But can’t think of any celebrity doppelgänger though 🤔🤦🏻‍♀️
he looks like Joe from You
omg his voice is so SOOTHING
We love Stuart! ❤  Welcome to the YouTube fam 😁🙌
He reminds me of my prom date but Timothy Chalamet edition
Hey Stuart! Nice to meet you finally!!! Mia seems like you have found your perfect match !
Im a Pisces and my partner of 27 yrs is a gemini get ready for a ride Mia lol
Never understand why people want more than 2 kids… it will only make the human population increase, and we are already to many!
Stuart reminds me of a cross between Bob Saget and Barry Pearl, the guy that played Doody in Grease. Congrats on your engagement and many years of happiness.
Such a cute video! Thanks for sharing so much and being open :) Definitely getting Toby McGuire vibes no??

Stuart reminds me of a young David tennant. He is very handsome. They make a beautiful couple.
The way he looks at mia.... You guysss 🥺🥺🥺
THANK YOU!! FINALLY another woman who ISNT AFRAID to ADMIT SHE LIKES A MAN!! I've always said playing games is for children. What's the point of hiding how you feel?? Lets all be mature and honest about our feelings. ALSO, I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU TWO TOGETHER. MIA'S PERSONALOTY SHINES AND HE SEEMS TO BE THE YING TO HER YANG. ♥️♥️♥️

You guys are so cute love it, he’s so sweet happy for you both!
idk why but i think he looks like andrew garfield
JOE is that YOU?
Love the energy of you two.
Not a celebrity but Stuart is the spitting image of MatPat from Game Theory! Especially his side profile. He has the same nose, hair style, eyebrows and complexion. But hey! Thats just a theory... a doppleganger theory!
Hes kind of a love child between Tom Holland and Shawn mendes, Maybe Bob Saget( RIP)
He’s giving some serious Mat Pat vibes
I think his celebrity doppelgänger is Gregg Sulkin. He has similar features. Anyone else agree?
I’m sorry sorry I thought he was mat pat
Love how he just keeps looking at mia and smiling like all the time
OMG MIAAAAA U LOOK SO CUTE TOGETHER😭💛
JOE FROM YOU! (but obvi j the looks ;)) so happy to have met him 🤍🤍🤍 & thanks stewart for an amazing introduction. happy new year you two :)

He did so good for the first time! You guys are such a cute couple, I couldn't wait to see more of Stewart! ❤️  About doppelgangers, he is almost a copy of the boyfriend of one of my friends. I wish I could sent you a picture of him!

What a beautiful couple!
Thank you for sharing this part of your lives with us. Congratulations to you both, cannot wait to see the wedding dress ❤️
You guys are so stinking cute together! Stuart is so sweet and funny! You chemistry is perfect... who cares what the zodiac has to say. My favorite part was when you were talking about your fashion... died laughing... Mia (girl who lives in sweat pants and turtle necks): "I wish you would take more risks"  Stuart: Innocently asks, "This isn't risky enough?" then states to add reasoning, "I have an extra button undone." I can't even... way... too... funny!!!
First of all,  thank you Stuart for being so brave and let us meet you 👏👏👏 Second,  he honestly looks like Mat Pat from Game theory 😉
i love him already. the way he looks at uuu omggg
Stuart kinda looks like MatPat!!!
Stewart looks like ROBERT PATTINSON. Edward Cullen New Moon vibes. Same eyes, same hair, strong jaw, and just the way he looks at you is just like how Edward looks at Bella!
Your video is #6 on trending !!

Aww such a handsome couple! You both compliment each other so well, as if it was obvious.
His celebrity lookalike is for sure David Tennant!!!  I’m so happy we got to meet him, it was clear that he was finding so much comfort in Mia during this scary new thing. ❤️

Tbh he kinda looks like Shawn Mendes idk I just kinda see it it's pretty cool
To answer your question, I think he looks EXACTLY like Matthew Patrick the gaming youtuber!!! I knew he reminded me of someone but i couldn’t put my finger on who. im so glad Stuart felt comfortable to come on camera, hope I get to see more of you lovelies together!! ☺️❤️🥰
I thought this was a prank with mattpatt for a second

You guys make such an amazing couple.
WELL NICE TO MEETCHA STEWART, AND WELCOME TO THE FAMILY... WE ALL WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHO MAKES MIA HAPPY AND LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR DOING SO. AS WELL AS APPRECIATE U FOR "MEETING" US. LOL. (GOOD JOB BTW. U DID BETTER THEN I COULD DO).. ITS CUTE THO HOW U CAN TELL HES A NEWBIE TO ALL THIS. HES YET BEEN COMFORTABLE TO TALKING TO A CAMERA, OOOR MAYBE HES JUST SO ADMIRING HIS GORGEOUS MIA.. 🤗 I THINK HE WON ME OVER WITH HIS CREATIVE AWESOME THOUGHTFUL IDEA OF NOT ONLY CREATING SUCH A BEAUTIFUL RING(THATS SIMPLY PRICELESS AND SO MUCH THOUGHT PUT INTO THAT. NOT MANY PPL COULD THINK OF SOMETHING SO THOUGHTFUL AND MEANINGFUL LIKE THAT) BUT ALSO FOR THE FACT THAT U THOUGHT OF CREATING A PRICELESS NECKLACE FOR MAMA MIA'S BDAY GIFT. THATS SO SWEET. BOTH OF U GUYS SEEM SO GREAT FOR EACH OTHER. I KNO ILL CRY WHEN WE SEE THE WEDDING VIDEO. CONGRATS AGAIN TO U BOTH TO LIFE AND LOVE FOREVER....  LASTLY LOL U ASKED WHAT CELEBRITY HE RESEMBLES 🤔 AND I CANT REALLY THINK OF ONE. BUT IF I HAD TO SAY SOMEONE. ((AND PLZ DONT TAKE THIS WRONG)).... AND I THINK I ONLY SAY THIS MAYBE BECAUSE  OF THE HAIR.... HE KINDA RESEMBLES LIKE HE COULD BE "BOB SAGET" (DANNY TANNER-THE DAD-FROM FULL HOUSE) COULD PASS FOR MAYBE A YOUNGER BROTHER OF HIS. 🤷🏻‍♀️ LIKE I SAID, ITS PROBABLY CUZ OF THE HAIR THO... 😀
I love you guys!!!💗💗💗

Y’all are cute 🥰
The way he's just so in love with her.. by the way he just stares at her the whole time !
Omg you guys are the perfect couple... can't wait for all the baking videos 😍
Omg y’all are perfect together!! But real talk, he is honestly like the mix of Freddie  Highmore and Robert Pattinson (with more Robert). Anyways I’m so happy for you Mia, you deserve a good guy like him!
We love a trending queen
Grant Gustin!!!!! For sure
I agree Tayce was great! Also Stuart is great as well!! Loved this video.
Aaaaaaa so cute you two! ❤
You are a great couple! ☆(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ* You are very beautiful and cute!! (≧∇≦)/
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG  YOU GUYS ARE THE CUTESTTTTT  I’m literally only 1 minutes and 58 seconds into the video and I’m internally screaming .  The way he just keeps looking at Mia MY HEARTTTTT  SOOOOO PRECIOUS
You two are absolutely adorable together and I’m so happy Stuart felt comfortable enough to be in a video. We LOVE him❤️💕💕💕
Love him for you ! Hear me out “fiancé reacts to my crazy outfits and wigs” or “testing weird wish gadgets with my fiancé”
He is so adorable! I love love love watching you two together and the chemistry. I love his sweet comments. He called you a dove 🕊 that is perfect and so sweet lol he looks like all of the stranger things boys combined but also someone completely different lol very handsome
I see a little bit of a young Robert Pattinson, circa Harry Potter but with a 5 o clock shadow 😂 y’all are so cute! My god bless your union 😘
He has cute eyeballs. They say that's important.
for someone who's been a follower for a long time, I'm so happy for Mia!! I can certainly see the love in the air!
He looks a lot like Grant Gustin! From flash!
He looks so kind
You guys are soooo cute together! ❤️
omg the visuals😭😍
literally right before u asked at the end of the video i thought to myself “he’s kinda giving young david tennant vibes” just slightly haha
In my opinion he looks a bit like Gregg Sulkin!
Thats funny me and my husband are incompatible.  He's a Gemini but a Taurus cusp. Acts completely like a Taurus and I'm a Capricorn.
He is adorable!!! I’m so happy you found such a fit for you!  And I think he looks a bit like that cutie, Penn Badgely!
he is with you because of your youtbe chanel… he is wayyyy out of your league
me having to pause every few minutes because my heart can't handle this much wholesomeness XD
i love how she pronounced itadori lmao
He's handsome  Awesome video
This video makes me so happy!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello Stuart! You guys are too cute 🥰
If you guys were to have children in the future.... I'll be so jealous of their lid space lol you both have such gorgeous eyes😂❤
Haha yayyy
Hey now … Gemini’s come in all ways we aren’t that bad, but you gotta look at y’alls whole charts
I feel like you both definitely complement each other very beautifully ❤️❤️❤️❤️ sending many blessings your way
Not gonna lie I think he looks like MatPat
He looks a little  like andrew g. !
My boyfriend is a Gemini but is the EXACT OPPOSITE. I’m a Taurus and I’m way crazier than him 😂 if there was a sign that was extremely sweet and thoughtful but also has no common sense and is super gullible, that’s my boyfriend lmfao

Young bob saget
I couldn’t help but think he looks like the twins Finn and Jack Harries! I used to watch their YouTube vids all the time back in the day!
Why does he remind me of Joe from you? (I’m sorry In advance. He’s nothing like him but his mannerisms 😂)
🥳🤩🥰🤓😍 = We LoVE Him! And YESss- Stuart looks like he’s Disney’s animation of a non-grimaced Edward Cullen…. But that’s just me lol. Honestly tho, his features look like many different celebrities…like he has the best feature of each celeb…it’s like he’s a little too perfect, ya know? Thus, he’s just a Disney Character!… Except, a Cullen Disney character…ya know?
He was nervous but we love u two so much. He can be more comfortable from now on. Cant describe how perfect u two are together
cusps arent a thing, he most likely has a Taurus moon or Venus
“The purpose of the wedding isn’t to see my dress” ugh I love you so much 🤣💗💗💗
OMG I HAVE THE SAME TURTLENECK AS YOU. I absolutely adore it and you TWO TOGETHER ❤ OH! And Stuart reminds me of an older version of Noah Schnapp from Stranger Things
Stuart reminds me a bit of David Tennant in Harry Potter mixed with Gregg Sulkin!
Mia has her own Walmart Edward Cullen and I’m so here for it
Imma say Stuart reminds me of Andrew Garfield!
Stuart is very sweet and handsome. Stuart was my husband's middle name; spelled the same way!

Mia saying what’s the big deal of telling your crush you like them… SO TRUE like I had to pause that part bc I’ve never thought of it like that I mean, I like you that doesn’t mean we have to end up together
Ommgggggg the way he just stares at you Mia 🥰🥺
OMGGGG FINALLYYYYY!!!! MIA IS SO HAPPY!!!!  YOU GUYS LOOK SO GOOD TOGETHER💞💞❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
He reminds me of Edward in Twilight i don't know why. Also, i thought he had a British accent, lol. But i was wrong, it must be Canadian but very closed (my native language is Spanish btw).  Wish you two the best! 💕💕💕 You look very cute and sweet together.
We need more!
For Halloween you guys should be Hope and Joe, from You. I said what I said 💗  Loved the video! Thanks Stuart for being vulnerable.

The first person that came to mind was Sam Claflin from Me Before You
Welcome to the family!!!   Loved this video. I think he looks like a cross between David Tennant (Dr Who) and Pen Badgley.  Looking forwards to seeing other videos with you both.
You guys gotta look at (at least) your big 3 zodiac signs to find out more about compatibility! Sun, moon and rising :)
Ahhhhhhh 🤍🤍🤍🤍😊
Timothée Chalamet

I’m getting Shawn Mendes vibes especially Stuart’s profile
My fiancé looked over while I was watching this and asked if I was watching a interview from the newest you season and I totally see how he thought yall were love & joe
he’s precious! also looks a bit like flynn rider from tangled. not sure if that counts as a celebrity doppelgänger but that’s who i saw

Me and you are so so beautiful you deserve the best and he is handsome and I can tell you two are very happy together. He does look like a celebrity but I can't think of the name I'm going to have to look it up and comment again
Y’all are so cute! I intentionally wasn’t going to compare Stuart to a celebrity but he kinda reminds me of Gregg Sulkin & Timothée Chalamet
he kind of looks like Penn Badgley.. might just be me i’m not sure
stuart looks like penn badgley!!!
He looks like Freddie Highmore, aka Norman Bates
its a good thing u waited to show us. that's all imma say
What a beautiful couple! Happy for you both! 💛🎉
I've been watching your videos for around 5years now and you seem like such a sweet genuine person. I'm so happy that it seems you found your match! I wish you both the absolute best!  Welcome to the YouTube family Stewart!
Welcome Stewart! 😁
When I saw that shaky entrance of Stuart, I thought “OMG SHAWN MENDES?!”
🥰
Damnnnn!!! He's hella handsome
Awww Mia he's so cute! And sweet and simple.. You two look to good together I hope you both live a super long life together and always stay happy, may god bless you both💗 And hello to Stuart, we love you.. We will support you and love you the way we love and support Mia 🙌
Loved this video! You guys are so cute!  Stuart’s doppelgänger I definitely think is Ian Somerhalder with the right pic!!
for a celebrity he kinda gives me shawn Mendes vibes
stuart totally looks like Andrew Garfield!!
Adore everything about this. Thank you for sharing him with us! 💗💗💗 Your chemistry is darling.  Number of babies DEFINITELY depends on how the birthing process goes. Coming from someone who had to have pelvic floor reconstruction after two giant babies, sometimes the body just says NOPE. Wishing you easy and healthy pregnancies and births, no matter how many you have. 💗 And a loving and supportive husband who helps you along the way and loves all your pieces even if they don’t look the same afterwards.  I have no idea what celebrity he looks like… I’m terrible at that stuff. That said, my first thought was “he looks like if Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and Robert Pattinson were combined into one.” Not sure if that’s actually helpful, but there you go, lol. He’s handsome. Nuff said. 😂
So nice to finally meet him! You two are adorable together! He definitely resembles Gregg Sulkin!!
They are ADORABLE 🥰
He’s exactly what I pictured for Mia. From looks to his quiet personality. They seem like best friends and true partners. Not to get sappy or cliche, but a match made in heaven. You can see how much they adore each other ❤️ Looking forward to wedding preparation content!!!
My immediate thought when I opened the video was that he looks like Gregg Sulkin
Super happy for you Mia! Congratulations to you both❤️
Stewart looks like the male version of Kristen Stewart playing Bella in Twilight
#6 video on tending!!
You two are so adorable together 😍 thank you for sharing part of your life. I look forward to future colabs together 💚💚💚

I could feel his nerves and I don’t blame him! It’s very intimidating I’d imagine. He is very brave and did really well. What a beautiful couple and I wish you both a lifetime of happiness ❤️ ps hello fellow Pisces
“Johnny Depp” 😂 he is so witty and adorable im so happy for you Mia! ♥️
Stuart, drop the hair routine!!!!!!!! C'mon, don't be shy
Funny you mentioned Stuart Little because the kid in that movie looks exactly like your Dad 🤣 cutiepie
I don't know how to describe it, but.... I actually don't know how to describe it 😭 but you both look so good together 😭❤️

🥰♥️♥️
Welcome to the Maples family, Stewart! We are so excited to see you in future videos:) hopefully you’ll feel a little more comfortable when you’re not being drilled in front of a brand new audience haha, thanks for trusting us and letting us get to know you!

When I first saw him I thought of Gregg Sulkin
This is EXACTLY what I thought he’d look like!!!!!! IN THE BEST WAY. WOW I LOVE THEM I LOVE LOVE
Mia: guys dont be mean to him or i'll delete the video. 80% of the comment section: He's exactly what i imagined him to be Mia
the way he looks at you 🥺
Bro i forget that they’ve actually been together a while so seeing Mia “bully” him (lovingly, as we all bully our s/o’s 🥰) keeps shocking me for some reason 💀😂
Wait why am I smiling the whole video?... 🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️❤️ your both cute . .. finally we meet you Stuart.. you and Mia ment for each other.
Hey Stuart we love you guys❤️
This video is sooo cute! I know this comment is a shout in the dark especially if you’ve heard it already, but about your back, try looking for Airrosti! It’s like Chiro means physical therapy and is better for long term wellness!
You both look so cute together 💞✨
Peter Parker? 😦
Mia: it's fun. We're having fun. I cannot 🤣 y'all are the cutest! I'm so happy for you both 💗 congratulations
You guys are adorable and I’m so glad we could finally meet him!! 💕✨
to me he looks like zayed khan (indian actor) from Main hoon na
Team Toby! The OG
LOVE THIS🤍
Okay you both are so adorable! Thank you for letting us meet you!
yall are so cute!!!! tell Stewart we love him (almost as much as we love you and mama maples, he'll get there)
Big shout out to formerly blurry fianceé for putting up with the public request to meet him! So happy for you guys! As far as the last question to US about his celeb lookalike… Stuart kind of looks like a mix between Daniel Radcliffe and Andrew Garfield to me 🤷🏽‍♀️
Aw he's a doll. You two are adorable! I'm so happy the both of you
He’s so handsome ! Just casually a stunning couple
Congratulations ! i wish you both a very happy life together.
He looks like Matt Pat!
We need a Stuart and mama maples video! Maybe have them pick out outfits for you
HE IS SO CUTE he reminds me of my fiancé 🥺❤️ congratulations guys!!
Oh my god the necklace he did for Mama Maples is SO SWEET IM GONNA CRY 🥺♥️
You two are adorable. My brother and sis n law are the same astrology as you two and they compliment each other very well. Sometimes, like you said...it doesn't matter.  Jonathan Bennett is who Stuart reminds me of a bit
He looks like joe from “you”!
Stuart looks like all of the Spidey's combined
Awe, y’all are so cute!! Idk if this really counts as doppelgänger, but Stuart kinda reminds me of Freddie Highmore
"but wait for this **gasp** *ad break*"
Stewart looks like Jacob elordi,.  btw i love the he looks at you mia.
I love this so much!!!! ❤️❤️
You guys are so cute together💕💕💕
I love mama Maples so so so much! Question for Stewart ..what do u do for a living
To answer your question, stuart kinda remind me of rob pattinson when he was cedric on HP
Odd that you should ask about dopplegangers TODAY because he looks like a young (and better looking) Bob Saget.
he looks so familiar but idk from where
From the side profile, he looks like MatPat. From the front though, I don't see any celebrity resemblance.
PEANUT, I love y’all Mia!! I’m jealous
adorable
Stewart’s celebrity look alike I feel like is Noah Schnapp (an older version)… something reminds me of him!
eeeeeeekkkkkkkkk he’s so cute :D
You two are giving me Dan and Serena vibes from Gossip Girl. I love it! We can definitely see the compatibility and chemistry <3 Indeed a great match!! Thank you for introducing Stuart to us. Wishing you two endless happiness :D
He looks like the character joe from the netflix show “you”. They honestly dress about the same too! I loved this video so much🤍
3 minutes in and the banter is sending me. You guys are a match made in Heaven. Nice to meet you, Stuart 👌
Stuart looks so much like Matpat. 😂 Idk if that count's as a celebrity but.  This video is so cute and i'm so happy for you Mia! 🥺🥺❤️
Stuart and Mama Maples have the same mannerisms and facial expressions!  Anyone else think so?
Yesss omg as soon as I saw his face he reminded me of one of the doctors from the show doctor who!! It’s quite an old show but the actors name is David Tennant (when he was younger obviously lol) maybe not doppelgängers but definitely long lost relatives or something 😭
Manifesting my own partner like this for 2022 🤞
😂 Stewart “I have an extra button undone”
He looks like a brunette Alfredo Linguini from Ratatouille
I have never clicked on a video faster in my LIFE. LOVE THIS AND YOU GUYS SM
I really love what Mia said about liking someone! Like yes I like you. Why does it have to be a secret? Shoot your shot, you might just dunk a fiancé! 💁🏽‍♀️
You both are such cutie pies ❤ As for a celebrity he resembles, I'm not sure why, but he reminded me of RJ Mitte (Walt Jr. from Breaking Bad). It's probably because of the strong eyebrow game xD
Omg love that this is trending
idc what you say those nicknames are the cutest thing ever
Mat Pat.. Stewart looks like Mat Pat
You two are so cute and he obviously cares deeply about you. :)
You guys are so cute! Happy to finally meet Stuart :) My initial thought is that he looks kinda like he could be one of the Harries Twins.    Mia, I am loving the wedding planning videos since I am also engaged too. Congratulations to you both!
They are so freakin cute together. I have never seen this side of mia before and its so cute
You can see how much he loves Mia by the way he just looks at her. Stuart is amazing! (Aaaaand he may have won me over because he is 100% right, Tom Holland just fits Peter Parker so well)
Honestly, this is THE couple! You two look so happy, genuinely happy! I'm a little envious, NGL! 😉 He is everything I would expect your forever to be! 💛 I am SO, SO happy for you 2! 🧡
I'm dying! The story about Stuart giving mama maples a  necklace with a diamond from Mia's ring is so sweet! Gave me chills!
Honestly been waiting for this video for so long! You two are so adorable and perfect together. So happy for you guys and well wishes your way on the wedding. We appreciate you both sharing your personal lives with us all. Nice to meet Stuart! 💖
Is it just me or he looks a lot like matpat , u guys are adorable
Aw Mia we love Stuart! ❤️
“ I have an extra button undone “ 😭😭
I get Tom Holland vibes from him tbh!!
girl, we LOVE Stuart! As for celebrity look alike, he looks like Mat Pat if Mat Pat took all of his style inspiration from Penn Badgley in You, and I mean that in the best possibly way. (But no worries, Stuart has absolutely no Joe Goldberg serial killer vibes)
So happy Stuart has decided to join you in a video! We all extend THE BIGGEST WELCOME and hope you can see what a positive and friendly bunch we are as Mia's subscribers, and hope that will make you feel even more relaxed as time goes on! Sending good and wholesome vibes to you both ❤
Hes 100% into you,  Mia

Edward Cullen. I said it within 2 secs.
I see a young Bob Saget #rip
So now I know why I feel a connection  with you other than, of course, your delightful personality, your sense of humor and your ability to laugh at yourself. We're both ♓ .
I forgot when they first got together. How long have they been dating ?
He’s so cute!! We appreciate him doing this 🥺❤️
It's coming up so blurry, I still cant really see him very well. My internet is terrible. Content was great. He's sweet.
He kind of looks like Shawn Mendes

He looks like Joe Goldberg. Clearly a very different personality though. So happy for you guys!
I didn’t think he would be so perfect

I think he could be Jake Epstein’s little brother!
He looks like Edward Cullen
the _second_ he started speaking, I thought everyone would be commenting on his accent, but nope! he's a keeper Mia, you two have such great energy together! congratulations to you both!
The chemistry between the two of you ! So happy for you guys .. i think Stuart looks like penn badgley right !!
I thought that was MattPatt 😂😂
I see resemblance with Penn Badgley! It was first thought at the beginning of the video
You guys are so adorable 🥺💕💕
I am so happy for you guys!. When is the wedding date?. #MiaandStuart
He kind of resembles the YouTuber twins Jack and Finn! So happy for you guys 💛💛💛
He's so cute!
Are you kidding me...  You could do so much better...
Love love love ❤️ Wishing you guys more then even the greatest threw out your relationship 🙏🏻❤️  To answer your question... when I first saw Stuart I thought I was looking at Christian Seavey! Don’t know if youtuber is the same as celebrity but that’s who I think he looks like❤️
You guys are adorable, and Stuart did so well. Thank you for sharing this part of you with us. Love you Mía and wish you all the best.

You both are really a cute couple...like yeah you both have different personalities but, that's make you both different and cuter❤✨
I don't know wtf I was recommended this cr*p!

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
💕Stewart!  You did such a great job!  So excited to meet you!  Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness together.
It bugged me the whole video… I couldn’t figure out who he reminded me of then bam! Henry Cavill!!! I’m so glad you found each other. You both clearly pull the best out of each other.
MIA THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOUUU AHHH 🥰🥰🥰
He literally looks like a 90s rom com love interest. So handsome and y’all are precious together!
You guys look so good together!!! 😊😊
Welp he’s perfect. 😂❤️❤️
Finally… you guys look so adorable together. I can’t wait to see more future videos. I hope you have a happy life and full of beautiful memories together 💛💛🤍
He reminds me of the guy from blues clues😊😊
You look so good together awwww
My grandpa was also the most “non-Gemini Gemini” I’ve ever met, so I totally have an idea of what Stuart may be like. This video also just shows he’s adorably into you and it makes my heart so happy. ❤️
YOU BOTH LOOK AMAZING TOGETHER 😍😍😍😍🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
So happy for Mia! You could definitely tell that he was nervous but I'm sure it'll get easier with time. 😊 Idk why but the whole time, I kind of saw some Shawn Mendes in him lol am I the only one?
Nice to officially meet you, Stuart! I am so happy for you both! 😁 As for Stuart’s look-a-like, I honestly think he looks like a mix of our 3 Spider-Man actors you discussed earlier. I can see similar traits from Toby McGuire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland in Stuart’s face.
I'm a Gemini to. He's so cute. Y'all look cute together. Thank him for being on the channel
yayyyyyy we love you
You guys seem so sweet together and Stuart/Stewart? seems like such a good guy I’m so happy for the both of you! And I’m so happy you have such a sweet guy Mia you definitely deserve it! As for look alikes I was literally JUST thinking he reminded me of Freddie Highmore right before you asked that and then it’s funny he said Johnny Depp😂
Probably two of the sweetest people I have ever watched, so happy they found each other. ❤️ Hoping he is willing to be on camera more often because his personality (and face lol) is amazing and I love seeing this side of Mia!
I am so happy for you guys!! You guys are so cute together!!💕💕
I don’t know him personally but I can see 10000% he is more of his Taurus cusp than a Gemini. I am a cusp on Aries pieces and I can not even identify with pieces at all. So I get what you mean about him.
This video made me smile :)
He is so handsome, you're a beautiful! I mean.... you are perfect together ❤  love to see you happy and so in love 🥰  all the beautiful things in life for you two and the new family you're going to be. Felicitaciones ! 👏🏻❤
He is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo good and niceeeeeeeeee person 🧿✨
He seems lovely, best wishes to you both xoxo
He is so sweet just like Mia! And looks at her so lovingly. Beautiful sweet couple!! So happy for you both! And excited we will get to see more of Stewart. 😀💕
So happy your happy. Nice match.
You are an incredibly beautiful couple!!!
Kind of getting Edward Cullen vibes
stuart kinda reminds me of this yter named matpat.. aka game theory, film theory, or food theory
So sweet! Thank you for allowing us to be apart of this special moment 💘

Adorable couple, he looks like a young Bob Saget to me lol
Look cute together 🧿 stay blessed, healthy and happy always 🧿✨
I was told that chiropractors are actually bad for you! Don't go to them because you're bones basically end up "addicted"  to the cracking and it makes it worse (im no expert but this info did come from a legit doctor) I hope mia sees this!!
He looks like Mason Greyback!!! (one Alex Russo’s boyfriends lol)
and the best part is mia and stuart being cute as fuck for 22 mins straight
💖💖💖💖💖
What he did for your mom with the other diamond, melts my heart. If I were a mom, I would drown in my tears of joy. He is so effing thoughtful. It's beautiful
This was so cute! I think stuart looks a bit like hugh grant but maybe its just the hair lol
and stuart is so hotttt>>>>>>>>>>>>>
He kinda looks like MatPat from the side

They're so cute together. They look perfect together and I think that Stuart looks like MatPat.
oh my gosh you guys are the cutest!
Ok hold the phone, I’ve never heard of anyone calling someone peanut and that’s what me and my bf call each other
Her boyfriend looks like London from the family camandfam YouTube channel. Am I right or wrong please tell me please.
out of all the youtubers i watch, mia’s comment  sections are always full of compliments
he kiiiiiiind of looks like Jacob Elordi
Stuart totally looks like Penn Badgey!
he’s so cute!!! Exactly who I thought she would be into, they are so perfect for eachother
I'm just so happy for the both of you. I can't say anything other than that. ❤️❤️❤️
Ok but seriously you guys look like a Disney character couple. ADORABLE.
You two are so perfect together. And Stuart is gorgeous!!! Lucky girl, lucky man!
Got a question how old is he?
His celebrity look-alike is definitely Gregg Sulkin!
Cute couple 🥰
So sweet!!! ❤️ as far as doppelgängers go, if andrew Garfield and Timothee chalamet had a baby, they would’ve made Stuart!
Just had the BIGGEST smile watching this! Thank you Stuart & Mia for making this! I wish y’all a lifetime of happiness 💕
Love this video
Ok not a celebrity but I think he looks like the YouTuber Finn Harries 🤭 I hope I’m not the only one thinking this
he looks like joe from YOU ahhahahaha
You guys are SO CUTE together!!! It’s obvious how well matched you are. Stuart is adorable! Honestly, aside from his face, he reminds me of Robert Pattinson in Twilight. (Hair, clothes, complexion) Like you know those images where they take a character and draw them except without facial features: you do that for Edward and him, and they would match! Lol. His face definitely does remind me of Gregg Sulkin, as others have said. He’s SUCH a nice guy! Thank you, so much, for doing this, Stuart! I can’t imagine how intimidating something like this would be! You did great, and Mia was right. This was the hard part. From here on out, it’s all fun stuff! Renovations, cooking, rating outfits/makeup looks, going shopping, doing challenges, trying out crazy products, trying on clothes: just general hilarity! You’ve got this! ❤️ Love to you both!
He looks like MatPat on youtube
Who else thought it was click bait but aweeeeeee Mia so happy for you❤️💗🥰
And.....the cutest couple award goes to...... MIA AND STUART! Oh my goodness so happy for you he seems so kind and sweet. What a perfect fit.

ahhh yay!! I'm so happy for you both :')
Amazing video! He looks exactly like I imagined him to be
So glad to finally meet Stewart!! You guys are perfect for each other <3 I think the celebrity that he looks most like is Timothee Chalamet :))
He looks like MatPat haha
A baby Mia with brown hair!!!!! CANT WAIT
Loved the video and you both truly are a match made in heaven. I totally think Stuart can pass as Andrew Garfields doppelganger easily, they both resemble so much 😮 ..
Wow, what a sweet guy Stewart is. He seems to really fit into the family well and his thoughtfulness with the engagement ring and the necklace for Mama Maples is a rare find. I think Stewart looks a bit like a young Robert Sean Leonard (see his Playbill headshot).
you guys are SO. SWEET. I can’t handle it 😭💗
So happy for you ❤️❤️
he looks like the werewolf guy from wizards of waverly place?? maybe???
Mia we love him 💖
I’m just excited that this is Rapunzel and Eugene irl

He’s so sweet SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
You two are absolutely adorable!!! He kinda looks like Penn Badgley. Like in the eye shape and facial expressions.
We love Stuart!!! So glad he was in a video - he’s so funny and naturally charming, he really adds to the atmosphere :)
How is he exactly how I imagined? This is lovely. I'm also a cusp of Pisces and Aquarius and feel waaaaay more Pisces
You guys are so cute together! You have a great dynamic and get along so well. As to who Stuart looks like it’s not a celebrity but he reminded me of MatPat from Game Theory when I first saw him😂
Not a celebrity but Stuart looks sooo much like Finn Harries!
He looks like he can be related to David Tennant
Love the duo ❤️

I feel like he looks like Danny Tanner from Full House! (Young Bob Saget)
He kind of reminds of Andrew Garfield actually!
Woooowwww! Welcome lol thanks for coming out on camera for us we truly appreciate it 😊 also I’m getting Edward Cullen vibes from him lmao very soft spoken and kinda mysterious 🤣

you guys are amazing! Stuart is soo damn handsome!!!!!! WE LOVE HIM AND YOU!! AND HIMMMM!!! SOO MUCH💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I feel like he looks like the one boyfriend on Wizards of Waverly Place that dated Alex. Can't remember his name.... but that's who I would say he looks alike.  Very happy for both of you 💕Seems like you are a very compatible to one another. You can see how much you two cherish each other by the way you look at one another!
#7 ON TRENDING!!! 👀

Okay idk if he is a celebrity celebrity but the whole video I felt like Stuart looked very similar to Matthew Patrick from GameTheory. I also think he’s exactly the kind of person I imagined him to be. Love this for your journey.

ADAM SCOTT !!

You guys are so cute I'm gonna cry ;-; I don't know if he looks like a particular celebrity, or if he does I can't really name them right off the top of my head. I scrolled through the comments and definitely agree with one person who said a mix between Matt Pat and Gregg Sulkin though!  I hope Stuart eventually feels okay in front of the camera from now on because I want him to be part of the YouTube Maples family that I love to watch.

Toby Maguire all the way

Mat Pat

You can tell he's nervous but he did amazing!! And at first I thought he looked like Edward (Robert pattinson) from Twilight lol.  Y'all are too sweet together
He looks like Jacob Elordi! ❤️
This man is Andrew Garfield - stick with the spidey theme lol
For me Stuart is a mix of Daniel Radcliffe and Andrew Garfield? Maybe? hahahahah Love you Mia ♥️
i just screamed FREDDIE HIGHMORE at the end
He is such a doll!! This is amazing
HEAR ME OUT  He looks like a young Matthew Settle (Dan's dad from Gossip Girl) but has a Justin Long-ish personality, which is pure adorbs. A wonderful match!
They say the best time to start thinking about marriage is after being together 7 years, that is when you really get to know a person better...living together first before actually getting married also helps as well. Life is too short, no need to rush into marriage, as it is an expensive contract and over half of all marriages fail. Take your time, because at your ages people will still change. Marriage is work, and a contract. I also wanted to mention it is work...hard work! Did I mention marriage is work? a full time job 24/7/365...no vacations.
Penn Badgley! Don’t YOU think?
😂😂 As soon as you said Gemini I said “oh no” bc my baby daddy is a Gemini and it was toxic I’m also a Pisces . But he seems so sweet happy for you!!!! ❤️
It’s so funny he can’t really look at the camera. Good job Stewart
Stuart looks like Shawn Mendez mixed with Charlie pooth
I always expected and imagined you to be with someone like him. You both look best with eachother. Mia you are truly a person with golden heart. So happy to see you and your fiance. Don't forget to invite us on wedding😄
Stuart reminds me of mattpatt
he looks like andrew garfield
This video definitely came out sooner than I was thinking to would. Glad it did, great video! He looks at you with so much love 💕 happy for you both! I don’t think he looks like any celebrities but he kind a looks like the blues clues guy😂 much love!!
Congratulations Mia! Wishing you so much happiness <3 PS: Stuart's celeb doppelganger is definitely Andrew Garfield!
I love Stuart! Stuart & Mia 💙💙💙💙🌹🌹🌹🌹
He’s literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
You guys are adorable together & #9 on trending 😊
You two are so cute together!! I’m glad Stuart decided to start being in videos 😊
"Where both on the same page here" Mía: Im not a 100% sure 😂😂😂
Does Stuart have a French Canadian accent? Or is it just a different providence accent?
Im I the only one that feels butterflies when they see each other and put that cutey smile??? Its so cute like their loves shows so much when they look at each other its so cute. We should have asked Stuart if he watched any of Mia’s videos when they started dating.
You two are so cute together! Your fiancé is seems like such an awesome guy… and handsome
Love this, so glad we got to meet Stuart. It's adorable how supportive and encouraging he is towards you. He notices and appreciates the little things that you do for him, like bring him water. I bothers him that you have back trouble. It's precious that he gave your mom a necklace and that he put so much thought into your ring. He seems like such a top notch guy, and I'm really happy for you two.
So happy for y’all! Love watching your videos 😀
Mia talking about her Gemini bf takes the words out of my mouth bc my boyfriend is a Gemini but nothing like a Gemini
This is too much the chemistry is too real I can't
You rwo are so cute together. You make a great couple. Congrats. Stuart thank you for coming on her video and hope we see more of you with her.
Hi Stuart thank you for loving Our Adorable Mia ❤️❤️ You guys look great together hoping for more videos of you two in the future

“I have an extra button undone.” I already see his personality, I laughed, I love it, and HE IS PERFECT FOR YOU!! So happy for you both. Mia, he is clearly infatuated and completely in love with you and you guys are built to last a lifetime! Also, he dodged the annoying question like a PRO! I’ve been with my man almost 8years, and I want to show him that part just to teach him how to dodge questions appropriately 😂!!
Don't listen to too much zodiac sign stuff, as I'm a virgo and hubby peices totally opposite and this Sept 25yrs married. Xxx
Awww he seems like such a sweetheart! I love that Mama Maples and chip are so close to him! 🥰 And his celeb doppelganger in my opinion is Robert Pattinson...mostly the hair and eyebrows but Stuart is way better looking 🤣. Congrats again on your engagement! 💕

I can't stop smiling throughout the whole video 🤣 they're so cutee~  I wish all the goodness and happiness in the world for both of them! 🥰💕

I have no idea how to describe it but y’all just LOOK like you’re supposed to be together, like you just FIT so well I’m so happy for you!!! omg
I love watching your videos and I may have missed you answering this question, but did your fiancé ask your dad for his blessing before proposing? We've seen how important family is to you ❤️
I love him!! Y’all are great 😊
Omgg you guys are so cute together! You guys seem hilarious together!
Stuart gives me Penn Badgley vibes! (not in a creepy, stalker 'You' way, but like, him IRL)
He said Johnny Depp 😂 I love this my face hurts from smiling the whole time.
EDWARDS CULLEN ON THUMBNAIL????
He looks nervous but he did  this out of love and that is adorableeeeeee : )
Ayeeee  Mia ❤️
Stuart kind of looks like Tom Welling(Smallville) when he moves his head a certain way.
Oh, you're absolutely lovely together Best wishes <3
Yes girl!!! Toby is the best spidey. Thank you for agreeing so many people hate the fact I love Toby as Spider-Man
Awe hi Stewart! Gorgeous couple😁 Thanks for sharing your fab life with us fans!!!!!
Cusping doesn't exist BUT he might have a taurus rising/moon etc etc etc
I love his name because Stuart Little is my favourite movie ❤️
Ross lynch. And my ex boyfriend haha. It’s weirdly out of the universe how similar they look. That genre of male facial features A+ chefs kiss so good for you!!
i was thinking stuart looks with andrew garfield and tobey maguire mixed! then you got the spider man question
He lowkey looks like Daniel from Skam Austin
Congratulations Stewart, she's worth it!
❤️
He seems so calm & sweet, he looks like Keanu Reeves, congratulations on your engagement Mia, you deserve such a nice boy!
I’m so happy for you😭😭🥺♥️♥️
Picture perfect couple 😘😘😘 love you mia❤️
He looks and acts exactly like Freddie Highmore!!! He’s such a sweetie omg love
I think Stuart kinda looks like Andrew Garfield. Funny that you guys were talking about the best spider man and you said you liked Andrew a lot hahah
I will agree with Mia and say her man is a Taurus. I am in a similar situation, I am on the cusp of Leo and virgo (born in technically Leo) but I always say I’m a Virgo because I am exactly what a virgo would be, and not at all like a Leo. And my husband and I are comparable as me as a virgo and not a Leo- we are bff’s and basically the same person.
I kinda think he looks similar to mason from wizards of eagerly place. I don’t know the actors name. But yeah. Also loved the video! Such a cute couple 💕
I was going to say thank you too! Glad he feels comfortable being on the video. Happy you're community is as friendly as you <3
He looks somewhat similar to Matpat (aka the game theorist) idk if it's just me
Welcome to the family Steward
Not necessarily a celeb, but he kind of reminds me of Matpat the youtuber!!
CUTEST COUPLE EVER!!! 🥰
OMG this video is trending?!?!?!
Toby is my Spider-Man obviously bc I grew up with his Spider-Man movies. ❤️ 🕷
Awww Congrats Mia and Stuart on the engagement and welcome to Youtube (officially). :D
And speaking of Spider-Man he looks like Andrew Garfield to me.
Omg he kinda looks like edward from twilight lollllllll
Oh no. He's a Gemini. Run 😭😭! Jk girl he seems so sweet and I'm honestly so proud for you! We love Stuart and we're glad you two found eachother!
You are adorable and perfect together!!! This might sound strange but I think he kinda looks like Penn Badgley?
He looks like Jack and Finn Harries! They were twin British youtubers years ago!
Y’all have a great banter. Forget the zodiac sign I totally think it’s a good match. 😂
lol I used to read tarot and worked in astrology for a few years. My first thoght when looking at him was Taurus, idek maybe it’s just because im a Taurus. Look into both of your birth charts, this may explain a lot more about certain things, for example, I am a Taurus with a Pisces moon and Cancer ascendant. Honestly, its just kind of fun to see the similarities but your sun sign is not always accurate as other signs in your birth chart have stronger placements sometimes,
Such a great video! Thank you Stuart for stepping into the hotseat for us all :)  PS: Stuart kinda looks like Justin Long! Who btw is one of the sweetest celebs, you gotta check out some of his interviews
OH MY GOD 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
me watching this whole video: 😁😁😁😁
You're both cute together ❤

Stewart kind of reminds me of David Tennant, I feel like a Dr. Who costume for Halloween would be a good match.
He reminds me of a young Bob Saget!

When I first saw him I immediately thought he looked like Penn Badgley aka Joe Goldberg from the show YOU 😂
OMG HES SO SWEET , jackpot Mia
Stuart (idunno if this is the correct spelling of his name) really matches your energy Mia. You two are really compatible to each other. We're so proud of him having courage to sit in front of the camera and answer some questions. So happy to see you two! Continue spreading happiness Mia! And all the love for the two of you!  💖

How sweet! Stuart (spelt right?) just seems so down to earth and lovely. You two make a lovely couple :) Lots of love from Manchester, UK xxx
Stuart definitely has a young Robert Pattinson vibe to him and I really can't explain it. Is it the hair? Is it the shirt? Is it the *raging* taurus energy that emanates from him? Guess I'll never know. So nice to get to meet Stuart! You two look so cute and happy together, this was a really wholesome video.
so happy to finally meet stuart:) you guys look so happy together, wishing you all the best☺️🤍
Looove this! Blessings to both of you. 🥰
PLEASE THIS IS SO CUTE O MY GOSH
Mia I'm from Portugal and your fiance looks exactly like one of my best friends, the way he talks and smiles, everything!! Tell him he has a doppelganger in Portugal!!
Stuart reminds me so much of Shawn Mendes!!!
I’m a Gemini who’s not a “stereotypical” Gemini and there’s too much hate out there. Don’t worry we love you💕
Stuart looks like a mixture of David Tennant and MatPat from Game Theory. Also welcome to the channel, you did great!!!
Check your moon signs...
He seems like he fits with you and your family perfectly! I LOVE that he had a necklace made for your mom! He is a keeper for sure.
Bih GWAPOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
When I'm on camera I am so awkward so I totally understand stewart lol   also I'm Taurus and he seems so much like a Taurus to me maybe he got switched with another baby at birth lol
wait what is his fave drag queen i need to know?!
My brother is a Pisces and his wife is a Gemini. They met when they were 15 and have been married for over 15 years. Congrats Mia 🎉 💍
stewart gives me edward in biology class vibes. like twilight.
JAMES BLUNT
You look so cute together! I don’t know who he looks like but he could play Spider-Man haha
So happy for you guys! And a handsome lad, well done Mia 👏. It's  crazy that you asked what celebrity he looks like because I was already thinking he looks like Brandon Routh (2006 Superman, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, etc) The eyebrows and eyes for sure
So what I’m hearing is Mia and Stuart are goals for a relationship, but that we need to see Stuart’s relation-Chip ;)
Stuart is adorable...
Am I the only one who hits the like button before the video has even played?
The two of you make a lovely couple.  Your kids will be so cute.  Wishing you a wonderful life together.
He looks like he could be an older brother of noah schnapp from stranger things!
So not exactly a "celebrity" but he reminds me of fleur de force's husband!!
Yay!!! I love you mia! I’m glad you did this, couldn’t stop smiling, you guys are adorable🥰
Penn Badgley is the only one I can think of 🤔
lmfao not him roasting you ahah, you guys are so cute!!
Mia! He’s adorable! As for celebrities… I think if Edward Cullen had a son it would be Stuart.
Stuart looks like Gregg Sulkin! That was my first thought when he appeared on screen
They look so cute together 😍🥺
You guys are so sweet and at ease together!! So happy for you, Mia! 💖 P.S. Stuart reminds me so much of Finn & Jack Harries!
He is adorable
I LOVE YOU STUART. WELCOME TO THE FAMILY WE ARE SO HAPPY YOU’RE HERE
Soo sweet :) Not gnna lie, he kind of reminds me of Penn Badgley!
you guys look great together! so happy for you both ❤️  i think stewart looks like penn badgley  idk maybe it’s just the hair 😂😂❤️
awwwwwwwww 🥰
OMG. why does he look like he could be my fiance's brother?? Mia I love this for us! Lol. Congrats you guys 😻 thank you for visiting us, Stuart 🥰
he doesn't even look like him but just reminds me of him, Robert Pattinson aka Edward Cullen from Twilight. Oddly enough, they just remind me of each other.
You guys are so well suited. Beautiful dynamic.  Loved this video.  Lovely couple.
I think Stewart looks like a combination of Robert Pattinson and Timothée Chalamet!! Also congrats on the engagement!
okay, so I can't leave this video without telling you some (a lot ) of celebrities that he looks like . 1. Dylan O'Brien 2. Damen Salvator 3. Tom Welling 4. Cameron Boyce 5. Matthew Lawrence 6. Charlie Rowe. Now you might think completely different but I hope I helped look them up and try to see which one You guys think.😚
F in the comments if your dog likes your boyfriend more than you 😭
Toby is Spider-Man.
Like a littttttle bit Evan Peters? HI Stuart 😋
I didn’t make the cut 😓 but that can’t change the fact that I am SO excited for this video 🥲 I am so happy for the both of you. You found a diamond in the rough and I can tell he will treat you as you deserve to be treated. I’m wishing you a life of love and happiness
The way he looks at Mia is so adorable
STUART LOOKS LIKE: Joe from YOU on Netflix Robert Pattinson Luke Grimes from Yellowstone
I'm happy that Mia doesn't have to blur out his face now. I know editing is tedious and every little bit less counts! Stuart seems very nice and sweet. Hopefully he learns to live with Mia's back issues quickly. Good luck to the happy couple!!
I started tearing up when you said he got a necklace made for your mom🥲 he’s a keeper💗
Loveeeeed watching him come out of his shell throughout the video 😍 y’all are so cute together!!!!
I had joslyn fox come to my drag show once ❤️ she’s so sweet in person. I also think he looks like Justin long a bit.
I was smiling all the time ..you guys so sweet ...wish you guys the best ..so happy for you mia !
I think he looks like Gregg Sulkin!!
He kinda reminds me of shawn mendas
Quick thing about zodiac if you go by the new line there's 13 if you go by old it's 12. I'm a Taurus in the 12 but Aries in the 13 so I'm a cusp. So it makes sense if Stuart is more Taurus bc with the 13 he probably is 💖
Emerged this was adorable! I am super happy for you. He is super cute (your both lucky & great people 😍😍😍
Stuart is great. I think he looks like Timothy Charlemagne, hope I spelled that correctly.
is it just me or does stuart kinda look like a slightly older louis partridge???
Kind of looks like a younger Joe Goldberg to me 🤷‍♀️
Gives me Penn Badgley vibes
Happy to meet you! Welcome to the family and I wish the best for you guys' future together. ❤  Enjoy life, make memories, love everyday!
he has a really calming voice, i’m so happy for you two you look very happy together ♥️
Such a sweet duo. Love how you two look together. God bless always. Stay healthy and be safe. 💛💛💛
You guys are so cute! Glad you don't care about the zodiac thing.  And... compatability has to do with so much more than your sun sign which is just how you present in the world, not how you truly are all around. Still the most important thing is that you feel you're compatible :)
awww hes cute im so happy for you mia
Oh my gosh he is so cute and sweet and perfect for you 🥺 Thank you Stuart for being in this video!
AAAAAWWWWW  I'm getting rob pat/ josh hartnett vibes
mia i’m a gemini and my boyfriend is a pisces 😮

me, watching this vid : 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺... they r so cute, i can't
not really a celeb - but he IS Mat Pat Junior (game theory) for sure
oh my goodness. He seems the sweetest and you guys are glowing together. So happy for you guys.
She keeps looking at his lips 💋
Stuart totally looks like Matt Patt from game theory
Mia, I’m so happy for you!! Btw, he totally reminds me of Andrew Garfield
The first person I thought of when I saw Stuart was the actress Gregg sulkin
He kinda looks like he himself could be a Peter Parker hahaha
He kind of looks like Tom Cruise and maybe a little like Robert Patterson
He is a cutie. You are a cutie. Y’all are so cute together 💛
Cusp Zodiacs are known to usually take on the personalities of the cusp.
You guys suit each other so well! It is so nice to finally meet him!
what an angelll!! im so excited to see him in more videos :) just brings good vibes <3
ohmygosh! you two are so ADORABLE! can't wait for the wedding vlogs😍😍😍😍
Awww hes adorable! You can tell that he’s really shy in front of the camera but he still came! ❤️❤️❤️
I don't know, but I saw him for the first time and immediately thought "Joe Goldberg," well Penn Badgley lol !
Idk who but he looks like someone! Like this one celebrity or actor but I can’t think of him!
I adore you two together! Such a perfect couple♡ Can't wait for more content with you two🥰
Finally u came sir.... u better take care of sweet mia as she has 3 million friends soon to be 10 million in future. Ur vry lucky to have a women like her. Love u mia nd ur vedios.
❤️❤️
I’m so happy for you both, he is a good man Mia, congratulations on your engagement ❤️🙏🏼✨
This is toxic af. Not in a cute acceptable way. This woman is narcissistic as hell
Definitely a mix between joe from YOU and Ryan from HSM
I also look at Zodiac signs as a fun pastime and I think you could find more traits that fit Stewart and yourself if you look into rising and moon signs too. I'm a Virgo and my fiancé is a Leo and we're supposedly incompatible too. But he doesn't even agree with most Leo traits. So I found out I'm a sun and moon Virgo, and a rising Cancer. Which explained a lot (to me) about why I turn into a sensitive little crybaby who gets my feelings hurt easily even when I have the self-awareness that I'm being dumb because it was a joke or teasing. He is a sun Leo, Moon Taurus, and Rising Scorpio. I definitely see more of the latter two in him and as it turns out our rising signs Cancer and Scorpio are actually compatible!
We must protect him at all costs! He is so in love with her and it makes me so happy! I've been watching her channel for years and I am so happy to see her settling down with someone who adores her 😭😭😭❤❤❤
My hubs is a Pisces and I'm a Gemini and there are a lot of things within astrology that determine compatibility, BUTTT with that being said we've been together almost 7 years and happily married with three dogs! So happy for you two, Mia <3
This video made me smile so much 😭😭😭😭 so cute !!!!
You guys are adorable together Im so happy for you both!! The only person I can think of is he kind of looks like Joe from YOU??
Very cute
he reminds me of robert pattinson
Literally watching Stuart looking at you the whole time 🥺 you guys are a match and so lucky to be with each other. I hope a good future ahead for you two ❤️❤️❤️
LOVE HIM AND I LOVE THAT HE WAS WILLING TO FILM THIS W YOU ALSO I THINK HE LOOKS LIKE ANDREW GARFIELD
Stuart kinda looks like Gregg sulkin… I think it’s his hair and eyebrows
Mia you need to look at your whole astrology chart for compatibility! Especially moon and Venus signs! Stuart probably has a lot of Taurus placements if he’s born on the cusp. And I bet you have some Sag or Gemini placements in your chart considering how well you get along with those signs. I think it would be a really fun video if you got a birth chart reading! Also lovely to see you so happy in this video.
He resembles a young Bob Saget (RIP)

I love him😭 I would subscribe to Stewart’s YouTube channel 🤣❣️
Looks like TRUDEAU, deadass
You can tell he's not used to being an online personality because he stares at the person speaking instead of the camera.
Aaaaa so handsome
Stuart looks similar to Milo Ventimiglia imo.  He's also so nice and polite like Mia, they're a perfect match.
So handsome!

I thought he looked like Edward Cullen 🤣 so Robert Pattinson I guess haha
I think he looks a bit like Dave franco! Nice to meet you Stuart :)
I think Stuart looks like Harry Connick Jr, very handsome!!
Honestly, I think he’s a spot on MatPat Doppelgänger! You both are adorable!
Welcome to the Taurus/Gemini cusp gang, Stuart! May 21rst FTW!
I’m a Pisces And like 90% of my closest friends are Gemini’s so 💁🏼‍♀️
Mia is like finally I don’t have to blur him! I love the last time you put him in front of a mirror and so had to blur him and the mirror him 😂 he is amazing! We love him and can tell he is just for you!
he looks so much like MatPat from game and film theory lmao

He's so cute, and sweet. We can tell that he lives you. He can't keep his eyes off of you.
Omg! Mia!! He's ADORABLE!! thank you Stewart for introducing yourself....you're so awesome!!! Love love ya'll together!!
For me Stuart looks like young Ralph Fiennes mixed up with Timothée Chalamet
He looks like Joe from you LOL!
I love these two! They were just in their own little world and we were watching it from afar (pun intended)!!😍😅
He reminds me of Nat Wolff a little bit. You guys are so cute together! ♥️
Kind of random but I think he resembles Mike de force, Fleur de force's husband. Not exact but they could be related.
Shawn Mendes!!!
Okay so not really a celebrity but I feel like Stuart looks like Mike De Force! Another YouTube husband hahah

You can see how much he adores you, and how much you love him in return. I am thrilled for you both as you begin this journey together and cannot wait to see how his involvement grows with the channel. Nothing but love for you both!
Trick with zucchini.. cut them however you want, put them on a paper towel, salt both sides and cover with more paper towel. The salt will draw out the moisture. But this was an awesome video!!
Okay he is a mix of a young David Tennant and Grant Gustin!! Oh and I also see Penn Badgley!
he looks like Flynn rider from tangled. loved the video Mia!
He gives me YOU vibes

Idk about what celebs he looks like but he reminds me of MatPat the YouTuber! He is so good vibes Mia! Well done.
You did great!!! Thank you for sharing!!
♥️
my heart is literally so full seeing her so happy 🥺🥺
You are such a lovely couple. He is not a celebrity but I think Stuart looks a little bit like Mike, Fleur de Force's husband (she is a British youtuber/influencer).
To answer your question, I totally think he looks like Jackson Rathbone (aka Jasper from Twilight, but look at the actor's photos and the dark wavy hair is totally Stuart) You guys are SO cute together! Thanks for coming into Mia's channel, Stuart!
Stuart looks like a male version of Ann Hathaway!
UHMMM he's an angel ❤️❤️
He looks like Prince Eric
oddly reminds me of shawn mendes
He looks like Joe from You in a good way lol
Y'all so cute!
I think Stewart looks like joe from the Netflix show YOU.
Awwww, how cute! Hello Stuart  I think he resembles Robert Pattinson from the twilight series!
A young version of Matthew Broderick
He is so handsome..nice Mia

"I wished u dived into browns..." "I have an extra button undone" i lived XD

Love you guys you’re so cute ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you, Mia and Stuart 🥰 we feel like we’re lucky to get to know more of your relationship. I love this!!
I think you too are adorable together. I love your question at the end.  As soon as you showed his face I immediately thought he resembled Shawn Mendes.
Is English his first language?
Aww he’s perfect for you Mia. I love the way he looked at you the whole time. He is genuine and sweet just like you girl.
11 on TRENDING 😍❤️‍🔥
YES!!! Toby is the best Spidey! Its a debate in my house with my teenage sons!
Aww y’all are so cute 🥰 & the second you asked what actor he looks like Justin Long came to my head lol
Ugh girl Mia I am 100% the same when it comes to being very upfront with crushes. I think it takes a lot of the awkward out and gets to the point!
Oh you guys are freaking adorable and so hilarious together!! You guys just seem so similar yet different in ways that both keeps you grounded and comfortable while also pushing each other to grow and try new things and I love that 🥺 also Stewart having such a fondness for Mama maples is such a green flag, men who have good relationships with their mother-in-law’s is a great sign of a wonderful and kind man. Happy for the both of you for finding each other ❤️
GOODNIGHT  IVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD  GREAT QUESTION ABOUT WHOS MOST ANNOYING 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

They are so cute together !! ❤️
He kinda resembles the actor Penn Badgley
I hope you’re Team Edward because Stuart is kinda giving Robert Pattinson 😆
Call me crazy but Stuart kinda looks Shawn Mendez
Stuart seems like a genuinely kind person. Wishing you all the happiness in love and marriage. Btw, in terms of whether Stuart looks like a celebrity, this may not count, but he kind of looks like a younger version of Fleur de Force's husband, Mike. But I also kind of think he looks like a British actor, but I can't think of his name?
I 100% just panic like him when someone asks me about the music I like HAHAHA
Mia! Stuart looks like a mix of Gregg Sulkin and Matt Pat. I’m so happy for you both, I couldn’t stop smiling throughout the whole video!😂 wish you both all the best and I have to say you’re a gorgeous couple inside and out❤️
The first thing I thought of when I seen Stuart was that he looked like Andrew Garfield and by the end I thought he looked like Jack and Finn Harries more!
My fiance and I are both a Pisces and Gemini. He's definitely not really a Gemini and he is right at the cusp of Gemini and Taurus
He’s literally perfect for you…He seem so sweeet an nice..I also love the fact that he like deeply stares at you when u talk😹 it’s so cute!
He kinda looks like Timothee Chalamet🤔

The way he looks at you and nods reminds me so much of Mama Maples. So glad to finally meet you Stuart!
He seems lovely! On the subject of who he looks like, my daughter walked past my computer and said "mia's dating Matpat???!!!!". I guess I see where she was coming from a little, maybe Matpat when he was younger
Stuart looks like Drew Gooden
aweee you guys are cute and compliment eachother so well I feel!! mia is more outspoken fun high energy vibe and Stuart seems more thoughtful sweet timid vibes. Mia encourages him out of shell and makes it a safe space to do so. Stuart grounds mia and helps her think things thru from another perspective, hess also her biggest cheerleader!!  ty sm for letting us into your world and meeting you!! wish you both nothing but love and happiness congratulations on your engagement 💒💍🎉💫
3 children! 😅 I’m 33 and have ZERO and I’m perfectly happy keeping my freedom and my body. Until I’m dang near 40. I’d like to have one and adopt one.  I’m glad I never had children with any of the horrible people I dated from 12-26. Selfish, lazy, disrespectful, abusive. It is my theory that anyone can pretend to be who they want you to think they are for two years , the next three is actually getting to know them. I could never make it past the first two. I didn’t want to have a whole person with someone I didn’t know. Congrats Mia! Thank you Stuart! We all love you!
I love the way he looks at you. (And vise versa lol) You can really see the love in his eyes. Thanks for coming on the channel Stuart!!! You and Mia have a beautiful path ahead of you:)
he looks like matpat from gt live!!!
“I have an extra button undone” he’s adorable, so happy for you!
"This isnt risky enough?.... I have an extra button undone." hahahaha

His celebrity doppelgänger is Noah Schnapp!!! Plz tell me someone agrees 😩

Congratulations and I'm so excited for you both! It was wonderful to see how much you truly adore each other. I think Stuart looks a bit like a young Hugh Jackman or maybe a young Hugh Grant.
Stuart is so nice! I think he may be a sweet fun guy. You look so good together!   I reminds me of Robert Pattinson.
Stuart’s celebrity doppelgänger is Penn Badgley.
the main character from the netflix show YOU (joe)
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Stuart for meeting the fam!!!!
not sure if it’s a canadian thing but the way he speaks is just like how you and your family speaks? (cant explain it- the lip movement and the smile has the same vibe 😂)
Zodiac signs changed!!! I literally found this out two days ago so check that you guys are still your signs!

To me right now he looks like if Andrew Garfield and Penn Badgley had a baby and he can take that as a compliment!
I feel like Stuart looks kinda like joe from you… in the best way possible
Love this so much! I am so excited for you two and the beautiful life you are going to create together.
Stuart looks exactly like Joe from You 😂 does anyone else see it?!
Omg he looks kinda like matpat 😂 from game theory (I do not mean this in a bad way at all!)
It’s so adorable and at the same time so understandable that he’s so shy, completely contrary to Mia hahaha but nonetheless you still are a perfect match and the chemistry between you two is just so cute! Wish you the best!! <3
Such a beautiful relationship, I look forward to seeing Stuart in future videos! ❤
He looks like Brad Paisley! The country singer 😍 whom I can say am in love with!! 🤓🤓🤓
I don’t know if it’s because they were talking about Spider-Man, but I think Stuart looks like Tobey Maguire 🕸🕷
I’ve always thought you would be a good judge of character and seeing Stuart I know I was always right. He seems like such a nice guy and I’m glad the both of you have found each other. I can’t wait to see you guys interact more on camera (if Stuart decides to continue, if not I completely understand and support his decision!) I’m excited for the future and your wedding!
Wait my husband is a Gemini and I’m a Pisces also but he is on the cusp as well and i swear he has way more Taurus characteristics!! Crazy!
❤️ this so much! ❤️❤️❤️!!!!
I don’t know why he kind of gave me young Bob Saget vibes from Fuller House show 😅
YAYAY HELLO STEWARD!!
The way u presented ur man . U guys look so cute. He is so sweet so do mia is .
Love the video. But my questions are what does he do for work? Do you guys cohabitation yet?
This was so sweeter than I expected aww God bless you guys! xx
SO CUTE!!! It's nice to meet Stuart thanks Mia!! I feel like most of the question were more about what he thought of Mia instead of actually about Stuart so I hope we can learn more about him that he's comfortable giving!!
We love Stuart!! Your the best!!!
You two make the perfect couple !!
OMG sooooo handsome!! Lovely couple !!!
you two look so cute together! i'm so happy for you mia!!!
Thank you Stuart for coming on the channel! I totally understand being hesitant, especially if you are a private person. But just know we are happy to meet you and have no expectations for you, just want you to feel comfortable and welcomed! Mia you are a true light, and you both seem very much in love and happy with one another. Thank you for sharing your life!   Also..to answer your celebrity question. I feel like he reminds me a bit of Eddie Redmayne from fantastic beasts, or Penn Badgley from You!
You guys are so cuteeee
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE AAAA
Stuart you fit into the Maples family like a Glove! Especially when you & Mia go into discussion mode and seamlessly lose yourselves in the conversation. It was almost as if you two forgot you were Vlogging. So cute! Mia has a way of calming you. You got comfortable with the Vlog fairly quickly. Mostly cause you couldn't take your eyes off of Mia. So sweet. Thank you for being a good sport Stuart. It was nice to meet you finally! Nice catch Mia!
YASSSSS
Omg he’s CUUUUTE! Yall are precious together🤍🤍

He has such a calming voice
Beautiful couple! 👰‍♀️🤵🏻‍♂️♥️♥️
I’m a Pisces and my boyfriend is a Gemini/Taurus cusp and we’ve been together 9 years! He’s the same way and not the stereotypical Gemini we all know 😂 they’re def not always right!   Wishing you both a lifetime of happiness! 🤍
You guys seem so good for each other! Can’t wait to see more of Stuart on the channel!   I think Stuart looks like Joey Bragg from the old Disney channel show Liv and Maddie!
So so happy for you!!! He looks really nice. Mia, you chose well!!!!
Howdy Stu
Looks wise he reminds me of Jonah from superstore
He definitely looks like Gregg Sulkin from Disney channel !
WAIT THEN *WHO* IS TATE?!

I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS WAS POSTED!!!! SO happy, you guys are so adorable, sending all the best for you two!
Nice to meet you Stuart! Thanks for this and for making Mia so happy. OH and Mia, he def does look like someone, I just cant figure it out yet.
He's so handsome! You two look perfect together!! He seems very nervous seeing as he looks at you 90% at the time but he seems   very loving that he agreed to be in this video.
You guys are so cute!
You’re such a cute couple!!!
Hey!!!! And all that jazz
Oh my goodness he’s such a sweetie and very cute. You two are very well matched for each other. ♥️
I definitely see a young Hugh Grant!
wait she's actually getting married? 😭 I thought she's just role-playing wth
Looks like the guy from YOU
He makes me think of a young Hugh Grant
Lol he says there’s nothing annoying about Mia. My boyfriend is the most annoying person I’ve ever met but I love him more than life. I’m also the most annoying person in my boyfriends life.
such a gorgeous couple omg
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Ahhhh I’m obsessed they’re so cute and he’s sooo genuine🤩🥺
He is super cute 😍
In terms of doppelganger, he definitely gives me Penn Badgley vibes, and that shirt combo is very Joe Goldberg of him
I love Mia and I love Stuart plus there are a match made in heaven they're so cute together!!!!
If you find the right photo of Ian Harding (Ezra Fitz from PLL), he totally reminds me of him!
He's so handsome and adores you. You both are so lucky! <3
They look asame and talking everything ♡♡
Did anyone else get Andrew Garfield vibes cause I definitely did? Like maybe it's just because he was brought up but as soon as I hear Spiderman I was like omg he looks like Andrew Garfield
I am happy for Mia and think her fiancé seems great. I just don’t think anyone should get married in their early 20’s, you just don’t know who you are as a person yet. Stay engaged a while, since you are getting married to be together forever, a few years wouldn’t make much of a difference in the long run.
Oh my god! Okay it’s happening. Everybody stay calm! Everybody calm!
He looks like Edvard Cullen, even my husband said that 😇😉
Joe from YOU 😅
Omg I almost thought he was jack or finn Harris lol they're twins and they're youtubers
Ugh Mia hes so sweet and adorable, good job! You can tell that he loves you, congrats on the engagement Mia and Stewart
this is such a cute video and i’m so glad we got to meet him!! you guys are such a sweet couple and i love your little banter
Finally!!! He is a stud! And u guys are just perfect together! Little fire Mia needs a peaceful guy like Stuart!
You two are sooo cute together 😊❤. To me he looks like Penn Badgley aka Joe from YOU.
Andrew Garfield.  You two are adorable!
Or charlie
He has such a soft voice and face! Wishing you all the best ☺️
He looks like Shawn Mendes
I was smiling through the whole video, you guys are such a sweet couple <3 They way he looks at Mia tells everything. I'm so happy that he feels comfortable to appear on the channel now, and I can't wait for the wedding!
Such a handsome guy.
Such a good looking couple. 😍😍
He kind of reminds me of matpat from Game theory.  He is soo cute. The way he looked at Mía with so much love in his eyes
I love love love this connection! You two are the cutest!! He literally couldn't take his eyes off of you for the whole video, he seems so sweet and just perfect for you. I'm so happy for you and I'm glad you two have found each other 💕🎊  Also I get what you mean about how you feel like chip likes Stewart more. My fiancee is the same with my cat, she is obsessed with him and so is he with her 😂
As soon as I saw him I immediately thought he looked like MatPat
He looks so much like fleur deforce husband!!!
The extra button killed me and he is Mat Pat's doppelganger!
I think he looks a little like Tom Cruise
I’m getting joe from you. But not in a creepy way
Stuart is awesome!!! He is a natural!! I love you guys as a couple!!! 💍❤️
I am gemini an my husband is piece. we have been together since we were 14 years old. we are soon 31 years old. we have 2 little girls.♥️ So its Works 😄
What a good lookin couple
My nickname for my boyfriend is Stew 🥺 and that's definitely not his name at all but my whole family calls him that lolol
The way he looks at you!!!!!!! ❤️❤️
Definitely Andrew Garfield and Joe from YOU vibes.💕
he looks like he's going to yell out "HELLO INTERNET"  Congrats to y'all <3
Stuart obviously looks like robert patterson.
Hey Stuart, welcome to our crazy YouTube family! I love how you got a little more comfortable as the video went on. I think you look like Bryce Hodgson but when he was younger. You have very similar big bright smiles 😊 He has kept his hair really short or shaved bald in recent years so you definitely don’t resemble him as he is now.
OMG he looks like Jacob Elordi! You look sa good together, Mia.
Aww he is so cute, looks like an anime character 😍  you guys look so cute together 🥰❤❤
This video was so sweet! The way he kept looking at you for reassurance, since he was nervous, melted my heart🥰 also he definitely looks like Penn Badgley (aka Joe Goldberg from You). And they both have that very slight gap in their front teeth which makes them look even more alike.
He sounds so sweet and kind!
Mia he looks like he makes you so beyond happy and the same for how happy you make him! The sweetest most deserving couple! Also he looks like Joe from You a tiny bit … 🤣
I think Stuart looks like Mike de Force, FleurdeForce’s husband!
You're soooo adorable together!!! I'm happy for you both!! <3 And answer to the last question: He kinda looks like young Hugh Jackman.
oh no i literally gasped and teared up at the diamond necklace for your mom ahhhhh
Perfect couple ahead
You could not pay me enough to watch that drag race thing even if you think it’s a great show, I could never stomach it. I’ll never understand how anyone can.
He looks like a vampire from the Twilight Trilogy. Does he sparkle off camera???
He looks like MatPat from Game/Food/Film Theory!! We love him!! Congratulations, you two, on the beautiful life you’re building together!! Stuart is amazing 💕
You are literally perfect for each other congratulations to the both of you 🎉
he has some very similar features to mat barzal
y'all are PRECIOUS
Ok weirddd but Stuart looks like Stuart little lol
stop yall are so cute I love it
He looks like matpat from game / filmtheory
MIAAA!!!! I heard the song Naive by the Kooks OMG I LOVE THAT SONG SO MUCH
This is purely adorable in every way. Seeing Mia in a little bit of a different light… although you are always so genuine! It’s just fun to see you interact.
He’s so sweet and I know It’s not necessary to say but I will anyway, “I approve”!  Congratulations on the upcoming wedding! It was nice to meet Stewart, he seems like a nice guy and I’m so happy for y’all! ♥️
This video was so cute, I was smiling the whole time 💖
I’m getting a twilight Edward vibe from him.
We stan mia and stuart 😭❤️
Since you asked if we think he resembles any celebrity I will admit that when I first saw him I instantly thought he looked a bit like Gregg Sulkin (who I first saw on Disney channel many many years ago)
OMG the way he talks to you is so wholesome and loving!!!! So so happy for you guys xx
This was perfect. 2 sweet soft spoken funny people. Perfect for each other. And he loves Chip that’s how you know he’s perfect for you.
Aw he’s cute! You guys look so cute together!
MIA HOW DARE YOU HIDE HIS PRETTY FACE
i actually thought he kinda looks like matpat! right when he sat down
Stuart looks like the younger Bob Saget (Dad from Full House).
So cute! Love y'all 🥰
Stuart seems so lovely - so happy for you two
MIA ! I loved him and I loved you in this video, I'm even happier for the 2 of you and I wish you all the best 😭 I hope we will see him soon in your videos, maybe with mama maples too ! I also wanted to say something about the compatibility of the signs, but the fact that you get along so well cannot only be explained by your sun signs, I think you need to look at your whole charts and your other placements (sun, moon, venus, mercury...) I think it could help you understand more about astrology and compatibility🥰
I'm also a Pisces! March 10th!❤️❤️ Love you Mia!
I think Stuart looks a bit like Penn Badgley
Omg i read a comment before abt how mia’s fiancé’s name is a “school supply” lol and I immediately thought abt pen. AND HE DOES KINDA LOOK LIKE PENN BADGLEY
Stuart  I would say looks alot like  a mix of Shawn mendes and Daniel Radcliffe.  But I realy think he is so sweet and I hope that Mia and him have an amazing life together!  Thank you so  much for sharing love you Mia!
As soon as I saw him it came into my mind the image of Flynn from Tangled, when you asked what famous person he looks like that’s the only thing that I can imagine. He kinda looks like Penn Badgley too... Anyway you guys are CUTE! ❤️

Stuart looks like a mix between Robert Pattinson and Mattpat from Gametheory
I sat watching wondering who Stuart reminded me of, then you mentioned Drag Race and then asked….I think he looks like Nick Collier (Ella Vaday out of Drag).  Also the way you two just light up and smile when you look at each other is just the cutest thing.
We are so happy for you Mia! We love him already!!! Congrats on the engagement <3, cutest couple!!
Adorable!

He looks like Andrew Garfield and maybe a smidge like Penn badgley

I love Stuart with all my heart. Also Mia, look at your birth charts. Sun sign compatibility can be overrided if the rest of your charts are compatible.

If you're open to it, you could consider adoption! It's more complicated than snap and have kids appear, but it's still a possibility :)
Mia I'm so happy for you both, you are a adorable couple. I like how everyone says that he is so calm. Like yeah me to, around other people, but  STILL WATERS RUN DEEP! Have fun you guys, lots of love ❤️

Y’all are literally so complimentary to each other. I love how he’s opening up and doing things for. THANK YOU STUART FOR BEING SO OPEN!!!
They are so cute I can't 😭
I’m so happy. I’m not crying 😭 you are 🥰😭
I'm a pisces and my husband is a Gemini. I knew we were 100% not "compatible" but then a couple weeks ago I realized we are both cusps. I'm a pisces-aquarius cusp and he is a gemini-cancer cusp and apparently THOSE cusps are perfect matches. And we both fit cusp descriptions a lot more.
" I have an extra button undone " i laughed so hard here 😂😂😂😂😂😂💜 U guys are so cute together 😂💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
WHAT A CUTIE!! Thank you for making this video Mia and thank you Stuart for stepping out of your comfort zone for us! ❤️ I love how happy you are and how goofy and comfortable you guys seem to be with each other. ☺️ I hope to see more of this relationship!

Totally getting Cullen vibes, love it! Congrats!
I’m a Pisces and my husband is a Gemini as well we have our ups and downs but love our relationship and have been together for 10 years
Absolutely adore him! He is so sweet and soft-spoken and I’m going to guess probably an introvert which is a perfect match for Mia who is more of an extravert and they always say that opposites attract and I think they’re the perfect match! I think he kind of looks like a mix of Andrew Garfield and John Krasinski😊
MIA HES SO CUTE

Noah schnapp!

Hi mia, i think your fiancée looks like matpat from game theory
Once he mentioned Johnny Depp, like… he does resemble a young Johnny Depp a bit
I freaking love your mom.
Yay we love Stewart!

Me looks like MatPat from game theory x
Cuuuuuute you guys !
He’s giving Edward Cullens vibes
Your fiance looks like victor from the corpse bride. Therefore he looks like Johnny Depp. Love him, he seems great
Aww so happy for you guys!!❤️
Y’all are perfect!
My boy friend showed me the coffee playlist and I listen to it every day now haha. Helps me get stuff done.
♡♡♡
Couldn’t stop just making “awwwwww” the entire video 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😍😍😍😍😍😍 you guys are so cute!!!!!
MIA!!! We LOVE him! I'm so glad he feels safe around you to be able to do this. Welcome, Stuart! 🤩
You guys:’) This is so cute omg!!
Thank you for being in a video Stuart!!! It was great meeting you, happy for both of you and you seem super sweet. Glad you and Mia found each other *as for look alike, I think the closest in my mind is Finn Wolfhard, but they don't look identical more like his celebrity cousin
Awhhhh I’m so happy he came out of his shell and met us!!! And idk I’m feeling like he looks like Stewart little….  (Just kidding)
Thank you! 😊💗 also I'd love to see a baking video!
Congrats to you both❤❤ We love you!!! 🥰🥰🥰
He gives me Edward Cullen vibes from twilight!!!
I find it hilarious that Mia asked that at the end because throughout the video all I could think about was how Stuart reminds me of some actor but I can't picture who it is sjdbs
He is so nonchalant! Chill! He really balances out Mias personality actually!! Lol
So glad to finally meeet him !! He’s so sweet and handsome
He looks like Penn Badgley in YOU aaahhhhh
I think Stuart kinda looks like Gregg Sulkin in his younger days !! kinda a little bit
Since you asked. I was thinking he looked like MatPat :)
As for his celebrity look-a-like he reminds me of Jacob Elordi
Idk if this was ever said and I missed it but.. Does anyone know how long they have been together? They are so cute, so refreshing 🥰
Aww, I love him! He seems wonderful ❤ idk how to spell his name (Stuart? Stewart?) but if you read this Mr. S, we are happy to see you whenever you are comfortable being on camera, but also don't ever feel pressured! ❤   PS: I just saw the November video about being engaged and holy shit that is honestly the most beautiful engagement ring I've seen in my life! I usually think engagement rings are kind of extra and tacky and not my vibe at all... but this is one of the very few I've ever seen that is so beautiful and classy that I would 100% wear it every day of my life feeling proud to have it be part of my look. It's gorgeous! And the story behind all the diamonds was so sweet
I'm so happy for you guys! You're made for each other! And i know you're hilarious together!
I get joe Goldberg from you with a dash of Tom holland vibes!!
OOOOMMMGGGG
I’m a Gemini and my husband is a Pisces!! And I have a lot of Pisces friends!! Idk why, even though they aren’t supposed to work - somehow it just works!!
"A pretty bird 🐦" 😂 we love Stuart already aww
Bro you guys are sooooo cute together I'm crying, mans deserves to be your husband and you deserve him too. Also he kinda looks like Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to me at least. Love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved the Video. Literally smiling the whole time. Thank you so much ❤❤. I reckon Stuart looks like Joe from You
Oh, he seems such a nice guy and a husband liking your mother is pure HEAVEN (trust me, my mom and husband absolutely love each other and it makes life easier)
Thank you for coming in the video and welcome to the family!
I think his doppelgänger is Jack/Finn harries! (Jacksgap)
Um I love you guys so much please we need more Stuart videos!!
Awwwww…. You guys make the cutest couple, God bless your marriage to be with many happy years…. He looks like Robert Pattinson ( Edward Cullen from Twilight)
You guys are made for each other 💜 Wish nothing but love and happiness for you guys 💜
you guys are so cute omg!!
It was so exciting to see the two of you together. Wishing you both the best life ever. Stuart resembles ?  Charlie Rowe ( Leo Roth in Red Band Society).
You are soooo sweet together 😍 love that.
Honestly he looks a lot like Matpat from Game Theory
Loved this video, yous two look so happy together, yous seem like a great couple, regardless of zodiac compatibility, also you had me dying at 21:09 at first thought you said beat him, not meet him hahaha, also good luck with wedding planning!
Omg i was waiting for this video from ever since you announced and I'm so happy to see you guys together!!he is sooo sooooo cute mia he has such a calm personality and i was getting good vibes from him plus he is very charming and handsome you guys look beauuuuutifulllll together love you both so much and am excited to see guys together again yayyy!!!!
You two remind me of my husband and I. Our zodiac signs are “incompatible” and we are polar opposites! I am the quirky bouncy one while he is very laid back and mellow. You guys will make such a beautiful family. Praying for you guys every day. Excited for your wedding!!!
He looks like tom cruise! ...love you guys ..such a cute couple x
Stuart looks like Dylan and Cole Sprouse haha. You guys are great together! All the best in your future life as husband and wife 🎉🎉
You should wear a wedding dress similar to the one in the film “Ready Or Not”. The bride is wearing a lace dress with sleeves and a turtle neck collar and while it is slim on the top it does blow out from the waist.
awww i’m so happy and excited!!!!
He is exactly how I thought he would be seems sweet and caring. Can tell how much they love each other, Mia so happy for you that you found you’re person. Congratulations once again on you’re guys engagement
He looks like Ezra from PLL 🤣 so happy to finally meet you, Stewart! Take amazing care of Mia! 😊💖
I think Stewart is a very nice shy gentlemen, you both seem to be a lot alike.  Your both so cute together.  Nice to meet you Stewart.  Much love and hugs to you both.
He looks like Dave Franco
I'm so happy for you both! I can't wait for wedding planning videos
Love the video  ps I think Stuart looks like the guy from ratatouille ☺️ (it’s a compliment)
What a mood I've always told people when I like them because why wouldn't I?
❤
Currently now trying to picture a completely satin ball gown dress lol
Congratulations!!! Such cuties together🥰 love the video and definitely see the compatibility regardless of the zodiac sign ! My boyfriend and I are Taurus and Gemini !
Congratulations to you both! So nerve wracking to be on camera so props to Stuart! For a doppelgänger I see Gregg Sulkin, and who didn’t have a crush on him in Wizards of Waverley Place!
Stuart is so sweet!! You guys look so cute ❤️ He looks like Andrew Garfield or Shawn Mendes i think!! Also Penn Badgley with that shirt !!
WOOOOO HELLO UNCENSORED FIANCÉ, FINALLYYYYY!   Fabby dabby video, looking forward to more from the two of you!! X
I just love how calm he is, it's so cute. And the way they look at each other! 🥺💯
You guys are adorable happy for the both of you!! Happy New Year hope you both have a safe, blessed New Year!!!!
he reminds me of Jeff Goldblum
He looks like he could be Spiderman himself!
He kind of looks like Ralph Machio a few years back or maybe a Scott Baio back in his Happy Days years. You too look adorable together.
He is a cutie patootie.  Congratulations to groom to be and best wishes for the bride. ❤️
I think he looks like Timothee Chalamet or Jay Baruchel. But cuter. 😊💜😊
Omg you are so cute together 🥰
Y’all are so cute together! I have to say I got Jacob Elordi vibes from him!
Hi Mia! in your zodiac signs you actually have a full chart, not just one sign! so just cause sun signs arent compatible, you have other planets that can merge well!
I LOVE THIS 🥺🥺🥺💛
also for the celeb doppelgänger thing i think he kinda looks like Andrew Garfield !!! he just also gives me a spiderman vibe if that makes sense LOL <33
He reminds me of a younger Bob Saget, the guy from full house!
It’s so weird because we’re meeting him for the first time it feels like you should be nervous or something but you’re not. I’m so happy for you two
Lol Stuart lilttle.....Congratulations to both of you
Ohhhhh have him rate wish wedding dresses!!!
THE WAY HES LOOKING AT U THE ENTIRE TIME IS ADORABLE. celebs wise im not sure
With the outfit…screams Robert Pattinson, in Twilight specifically.
Ugghh their future children are hair goals 🤩
I was just casually watching this but had to comment because it too cute! This is the sweetest video I’ve seen in a while and it makes me happy just watching
Awww u guys r so cuuute ❤️❤️
Omg there so in love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don’t have a specific celebrity that Stuart looks like, but he is literally the perfect match to the Flynn Ryder to your Rapunzel!!!! 🥰🥰
Hiii so happy for yall and Stewart is so sweet!❤️ You asked if he looked like any celebrity and he looks just like a young David tennant!
Such a cute couple
Mia, he is beautiful. Congratulations
Mia he is so handsome!
Stuart gives me doppelgänger of Freddie Highmore vibes (the guy from bates motel and the good doctor)
Absolutely the cutest video ever! I love this so much
Stuart reminds me of a much (much) younger Dermot Mulroney. It's possibly the hair? X
i am crying rn 😭😭 thank you so much stuart and i’m so happy for y’all
IDK if this counts as a celebrity but he for sure looks like Matt Pat from Game Theory!!!!!
I'm glad you wanted to know who he looks like. All I could see was a young Bob Saget! He could play Danny in a Full House remake for sure.
Stewart reminds me of the actor that does Charlie in Charlie and the chocolate factory, and also The good doctor now I think! 😜 also best taste in music honestly 👍🏻 you just look so lovely together ❣️
"do you wanna do the Sharpay thing?" I'm sold already
Why is he what i envisioned lol
He did GREAT!!! Most boyfriends/husbands come on trying to takeover.  Not cool! BUT he was sweet & cute and gets my approval AS LONG AS he treats you well and makes you happy darlin.  😊
He’s so cuteee. Awee you guys make a super cute couple.
This was the cutest video ever! So glad to see Stuart finally comfortable enough to be on your channel. I can’t wait to see what other fun videos you’ll do together in the future ❤️
hi
you guys are so adorable aaaaaa!!!! I had a smile on throughout the video and the way he looks at you most of the time is so cute. Best wishes Mia!  and idk why but I see a slight resemblance to Andrew Garfield? or maybe someone else I can't put my finger on it
Perfect match!
I wouldn't say Stuart looks like a specific celebrity, but I would say he looks like he could play spider man!  Cute video Mia and Stuart!  ❤️
Yayyy!!! So excited to finally meet your man! I love seeing the two of you talking and laughing together🥰 such warm and fuzzy feelings about this❤️
how does he look exactly what I thought he would look like bahahahaha he's adorable!
He looks like game theory
Edward from twilight.
Stuart is such a perfect fit for the Maple family! The diamond story with Mama Maples is the sweetest thing
Crying, screaming, throwing up- y’all are so precious
we love him Mia!! so happy for you
This video was hilarious 😂. I love how Mia is very animated and hilarious. While Stuart is low-key funny. Great balance.
Aww he’s handsome and seems so kind 😎
...the way how he look mia.. 😍☺️☺️
The way he looks at her is so cute 🥺
He reminds me of joe from YOU 🧢
Ngl he looks like mat pat from game theory(does he count as a celebrity?)
Stewart, you did so good on camera! That was so hard to believe it was your first time! Most of the time people CANT look at the camera and you did so well! It wasn't awkward at all! I could never do as well as you did. I'm so awkward on camera!
He sort of puts me in mind of Seth Cohan from The O.C./Gilmore Girls etc. Stewart seems like a very patient, kind, and low key guy. A nice match for you.
Awh he seems so lovely Mia! Thank you both for allowing us to get to know him better! 🥺 As for a doppelgänger, he reminds me a lot of Jack and Finn Harries or Penn Badgley!
yaaaaaaaaay Stuart <3
Where is he from, he sounds a little French lol
Why are they literally so perfect together?! 😭😭
To me he looks like MatPat 🎮
This feels illegal
Mia be careful, he looks like Joe from Netflix show "YOU
you guys are adorable! very proud of stewart for doing this video and it was a pleasure to meet him. thanks for the amazing video! hopefully you are both doing well and staying safe. <3
HE looks like Jay Baruchel for sure  and kinda Joe (you)  or L(sign) vibes
He’s so cute! Definitely see Penn Badgley doppelgänger in him
So nice to finally meet you, Stuart! And gosh, the way you two look at each other is just too cute. It's obvious you really love each other and I love that for you both! As for celebrities, he kinda reminds me of Ryan McCartan! Not a ton, but just enough that that was the first person I thought of when you asked. Anyway, congrats you two, and best of luck for the future!
He’s perfect for you!! I can’t i can’t tell you more than how genuinely HAPPY beyond Happy I am for you Mia words can’t even describe how happy I am for you 2!  🙏🏽🙏🏽
Omg.  Children getting married. So funny to me. I'd love to see them 10 years from now. All I can say is, life is hard. Don't underestimate this.

The main thing about your zodiacs is if your moon and rising are compatible. Your main is your personality
Cute.....cute....cuteness overload......
Joe Goldberg from "You"
What a cute video. I think Stuart looks a lot like MatPat, and a bit like young Rupert Everett)
bro idk why no one's not saying this BUT HE LOOKS LIKE MATPAT [from his side profile at least]
He reminds me of your Dad. The way he talks to you! So sweet. I’d say Andrew Garfield would be a close doppelgänger.
Penn badgely…he looks like a younger Penn bandgely😝
Dont know why but video makes me sooooo happy! Hi, Stuart! Take good care of our sunshine ❤️
You guys look so cute together by the way 💖
Doppelgänger question:  This is gonna sound weird but Stuart gives me Peter Parker vibes PERIOD. he could honestly be a Peter Parker from another universe I SEE IT. Also I get Andrew Garfield vibes from Stuart :)

RESPECT 14:12 I wished I was brave like u 🥺p.s u guys are so cute!!
Sun signs aren’t that important to determine compatibility. You have an entire chart. Probably have compatible Venus signs.
I would say he is a mix of all the spideys ngl!  So happy for you guys!
He looks like Tom Walling from Smallville

Andrew Garfield Cross with Tom Holland
So happy for you Mia!! You deserve all the happiness in the world ❤️
To me, Stuart's celeb lookalike is a young Bob Saget. Also, for someone on camera for the first time he didn't really seem too nervous at all! Great job!
:O MY FAMILY HAD ZUCCINNI LASAGNA LAST NIGHT TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You guys are so cute!! He also looks so muck like Patrick Schwarzenegger!
I'm the cusp of Taurus and Gemini too! What's his birthday I wonder if we have the same one!!! Also I also am so much more of a taurus than gemini too
Mia! He is so handsome! And seems like such a genuinely good guy!
David Tennant
Oh I love his calm sense of humor!! I am vibing with Mr Little (I really hope you got the joke) 😅
And Mia! Yes! You’re hilarious!! Welcome to the fam Stuart/Stewart.   He seems perfect ❤️.
He’s adorable and it’s so clear you two are perfect for each other. Ugh this is so wholesome. Goals 😭💓
Awesome man! So blessed to have each other 💞
Run away from geminis
I keep cackling at how shook he looks. It’s okay Stuart (sorry if I misspelled) I think everyone in Mia’s fan base are so so kind!  So happy for you both and excited for you guy’s journey
he gives me harry styles vibes like so chill
oh i was already planning on commenting this, but then mia asked about it: Stuart (Stewart?) looks very similar to the youtuber MatPat, ESPECIALLY in profile. It was the only thing I could think about while watching lol
You both look so good together on camera 😍 I was smiling all throughout the video 🥰 Your so cute together like I love how Stuart keeps on staring at you 😊
MIAAAA hes so cute !!!!
So nice to finally meet Stewart! Lovely couple :) I can’t wait for more videos with him!
Nice meeting Stuart. Congrats to you both. Cute couple.

You guys are so cute 🥰
So good to meet you Stuart!!!!
He looks like the guy for the show YOU ON Netflix
So happy to finally meet Stuart! You two seem to have such a beautiful friendship that will help flourish your marriage!! Mia, he kind of reminds me of Daniel Radcliffe, but with dark eyes. Congratulations you two and welcome to the Family!
Cute!! 😁😁👌👌❤️❤️
Reminds me of James Marsden a little bit
MIA LIKES THE KOOKS AHHH
He is so good looking! Love his calming demeanor. The only person comes to mind is Karate kid when he was young!
Stuart and you are an adorable couple! I am so glad we got a chance to get to know him better and see you two together🥰🥰 that being said as someone else mentioned I am also getting Penn Badgley vibes (joe goldburg) I am not sure I wrote any of those two right ahhaha
You know, so many YouTubers bring on their partners (married or not) and sometimes you get a vibe from watching them, that shows their relationship IRL and if they have that strong couples factor and you two truly have it. I see your mom and dad vibe with you two, that happy, strong friendship and love. No doubt we will see the long journey of you two from now, to kids (if you choose), to wedding anniversaries etc…thanks to Stewart for stepping outside his comfort zone so we can see Mia’s other half.
YOU GUYS ARE SOOO CUTE !!!!
You can literally tell how much he loves her by the way he looks at her. I'm not crying, your crying 😭
Does Stuart looks like any celebrities?  PLEASE HE HAS SHAWN MENDES HAIR AND I CANT UNSEE IT 😂
Mia keeps interrupting Stewart I wonder if she is more nervous?
Dave Franco doppelgänger
He looks like a young Bob Saget. Full house dad
WE LOVE YOU STEWART!🤍
Okay but the way he looks at you.. wow 😍😍😍 Really happy for you guys
He looks like grant gustin
"How many kids do you want?? We both said 3" 😂🤣 My husband and I had also said 3 but then our first pregnancy resulted in a natural, spontaneous set of twins. We're done now.
lmao u should make a video comparing ur two birth charts
Oh hunny, never call a man stubby 😂😂😂 that's just wrong.
You two are so cute! So happy to meet you finally Stuart 😊 hi from Australia
Mia!!! Stuart looks so much like Joey Kidney in my opinion! He is a youtuber and has a tiktok (his account/channel name is just his first and last name). You should definitely go search him up and see if you see the resemblance
He kinda looks like young Robert Pattinson
So sweet! Thank you for sharing your lives it’s so nice to finally "meet" c: I think he looks like David Tennant
I think he looks a lot like Joshua Bassett
You two are so cute together and I think you have similar personalities, he seems very calm. I think Stuart remmembers me to Adam Brody in The OC series. PS: Excuse my English and greetins from Spain.
So so awesome to finally learn a little about him! He seems so sweet and genuine and calm. So happy for you!!! Can't wait to see him in upcoming videos (fingers crossed)
He reminds me of Edward from Twilight, the light skin and dark eyes. You guys are so sweet together! Can’t wait for Stuart to be in more videos :)
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you so much Stuart for being in the video! I‘m a very private person too and I can imagine that it wasn’t an easy decision. But you two seem to be perfect for each other and I’m looking forward to seeing more content from you :) all the love from Germany!
penn badgley !!!!
I think he looks like a couple of people maybe lol. I can see Gregg Sulkin but when he was on Wizards of waverly place. And I could also see Chuck from Gossip Girl a little bit. And Daryl Sabara.
Stewart seems like a great guy and you make a sweet couple.
He’s so cute!!
He lowkey looks like Ezra from PLL
Am i the only one who thinks that Stewart kinda looks like Matpat?!
I’ve been with my husband for 5 years, 2 kids I’m a Pisces he’s a Gemini his birthday is 5.21 which I assume is your fiancés bday too since it’s a cusp. 💓💓💓 this is a great match.
It’s nice to meet him! You two are so cute together. Congratulations on your nuptials!
Really love your Chemistry! The love is overflowing it's so sweet! And also I had an inkling that he looks the way he looks with the reveal! Perfect for each other!!! My heart is happy!
He looks like Jacob Elordi!!

100% at first I thought Stuart was Mason from Wizards of Waverley Place (Gregg Sulkin) aka. Alex’s boyfriend!!! 😂🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m a Gemini May 22nd, my bf is a Pisces March 18th! And we’re going on five years! 🙂
Stewart looks a little like James Marsden.  Hugs
He is wonderful! So happy for you! 😄
PEANUT AND STUBBY. SO CUTE
You two are perfect together!!!😍 So happy to finally meet Stuart! Looking forward to future vids of you two, especially wedding vid!!!! 😍💒😋
He’s so sweet and perfect for you Mia!! So happy for you two!
Stewart looks like Andrew Garfield
He kind of looks like Noah Snapp, from Stranger Things!!
I think like he looks like Andrew Garfield?!😊
I didn’t have Mia telling her fiancé “Oh Period” on my 2022 bingo card 😂
Not gonna lie when his face was scratch out he looked like Robert Paterson
Lovely to meet you at last Stewart x
he looks like david tenant!!
I definitely get taurus vibes from him too. What's his rising sign?
Awesome!!! Thank you Stewart keep up the good work keeping our Mia so happy!!
Thimothe' Chalamet
I love how his eyes were on you the entire time.. you guys look goooooooooood together..
he looks like Joe from YOU
Thanks for introducing us and letting us get to know Stewart, I cant imagine how hard it was when you're so private!! Look forward to seeing you more and in what ever capacity you are comfortable!
I feel like Stewart kind of looks like Lance Sweets from Bones 😂 you guys seem so good together, I’m so happy for you Mia
You guys are so cute together!! So happy for you Hi steward !☺️
Not stubby
awww matpat 😍
This is so cute!😭😭😭 Stewart seems so gentle and kind. I love that. ❤
Stewart is soo cute. Congratulations on your engagement and upcoming wedding I'm sure it'll be great. I look forward to see Stewart more often
Why does Stuart remind me so much of Edward Cullen omg hahaha in best way possible of course, I adore twilight 😂❤️
Heyyy so nice to meet you Please take good care of mia we all love her so much
Thank you for sharing your fiancé.  It is nice to see you so happy.
You guys are adorable! Also it might just be me but he kinda looks like David Tennant a little!
I honestly understand where she's coming from with the horoscope signs, but I will tell you that your mom being a Sagittarius is the opposite of Gemini and they get along wonderfully. Yes, Pisces doesn't get along with Gemini but you were raised by a sagittarius...
So happy for you both. I wish you nothing but love, happiness and most importantly strength. Don't ever give up on each other. Always fight through whatever it is that you are going through. Fight
He reminds me of Shawn Mendes. He’s truly a gentleman. Ty Stewart for being a good sport!!  Mia is awesome, just love her.
Penn Badgley!
OMG mia ….u both loook amazing ,,,like the best couple on earth…. He is sooooo nice handsome, shy, soft spoken and extremely innocent….like sooo cute….his voice is so beautiful…..like u r loud where he is quite and heavy weight voice……plz do a video on My fiance rates my outfits…..plz read my comment
Okay you two are adorable. Stewart you are a sweet man. Also I noticed that peoples Ig handles are like your first email account back in the day and you become an adult and cringe when you have to say it or let people see it 🤣 pick handles wisely 🤣🤣🤣 but back on topic “ who does Stewart look like?” i honestly don’t know ( I am not good with celebs) but I will say his eyebrows are amazing.
They seem like the kind of couple that you get way too excited to go have like dinner and a glass of wine at their perfectly decorated house 🥺 I feel like he matches your energy and compliments your energy so well! So sweet and kind and just radiating positivity 🤩 you both seem so emotionally mature and comfortable with each other it makes me so happy for you as a long time subscriber 💖 here’s to a long happy life together guys congrats 🥰
He kind of reminds me of Topher Grace from That 70’s show lol
love the chemistry so much <3 so happy for the both of you <3 and he kinda looks like shawn mendes :p
Prince Charming ✨👌🏻
Stuart TOTALLY looks like Freddie Highmore!!!! Y’all are so cute
I am so glad that he agreed to do this video!! I love how good yalls relationship is as well! He was staring lovingly at you the whole time and it was sweett!! Thank you so much Stewart for officially joining the online Maples fam!! <3 I am super excited to see both of yall in future videos!!

omg you guys are sooo cuuuuuuute!! So nice finally meeting you Stuart! Also i totally think he looks like Joe from You 👀
love him
Please don't feel too pressured to share y'all's marriage on YouTube! I've seen so many couples break down because their marriage became a reality show and not something private. Remember it's better to under share than over share and lose trust. So glad to see you with someone who care for you 💕💕
I think he looks very mush like Andrew Garfield😅
I think he looks like Noah Schnapp from Stranger Things
No. Fucking. Wayyyyy! He’s like an adorable cute little puppy with that shyness  😭 so so so cute! MIA you’ve nailed it, he is precious and I’m in tears because I just wanna hug him and say it’s okay don’t be scared of us 😭😭😭💞💞💞
❤️
Thanks, Stuart (sorry if I spelt your name wrong) the Mia family appreciates you coming on the channel :) also you guys are soo cute lol
Y’all are so cute bye
Loved to meet him and you look so good together! Congratulations!  Answering to your question: Stewart really looks like the guy from ratattoui's movie (don't know his name but the main one)!
OKAY i’m so glad you asked what celebrity he looks like cause i immediately screamed “HE LOOKS LIKE JONAH FROM SUPERSTORE” to my husband lol! so there’s my answer- he looks like ben feldman!
We need to know his rising and moon signs as well!! You two should look up your birth times and compre your whole birth charts
didn’t know you were engaged to EDWARD CULLEN!!!
SO HAPPY FOR U
Please do a QA again right before you get married and see how Stewart's answers change. I'd love to see if he's still too shy to admit how you annoy him.
You guys are too adorable! Love to see it
Speaking of wedding dresses.  Have you thought of trying wedding dresses recreated from movies?
My God he's so cute
He looks like Penn Badgley
Perfect couple.❤❤

When he said Johnny Depp… 🧐 I think yeah I can see it
He is so handsome and looks like a good guy..
Awww he's so sweet, you guys are so sweet❤

i think that Stuart looks like Albert Memeti, he’s an opera singer
Uggggg the way he loooks at her!!!! They are soooo cute!!!
OMG Mia, he is adorable! You got yourself a good guy there! I think he is unique and doesn't reassemble anyone but he is very good looking!
He reminds me so much of Tate. In the best ways of course.
"i don't need to be with you, I just like you." Amen, Mia!
"I wish you would deep more into browns" his hair is literally broooown what else do you want Mia? Hahaha this was fun, you guys are lovely!
I'm smiling so much! Thank you guys for this <3
Well, this was adorable. And my first thought is he looks like a 25 year old version of Craig Federighi, who is the senior Vice President of software engineering at Apple. He talks at a lot of the Apple events, and he could literally be Stuart’s dad. They look exactly the same.
Wait I’m in the mood for Mia cooking videos!!
this is the most wholesome video i’ve ever seen
Such a sweet video! So happy for you, Mia! He looks like Jacob Elordi to me
he looks a tiny bit like Robert Pattinson
To answer your question: In my opinion Stuart looks like Robert Pattinson
Such a cute couple 💛
You are both too good to be true, I am sooo happy for you - from Russia with love❤
This is great.  I smiled through the whole video.  I feel like a distant aunt or something that can’t help but be proud and happy for you both.  Wishing you all the best in your wedding and beyond.  💒
So fun! Love him!!
He is so cute and perfect for you! He is exactly like I imagined him to be. In a way, he looks like the dude from Ratatouille but in the best way possible!!
He definitely looks like Joe from YOU!!!
You two are adorable 🥰 Stewart seems like a perfect match for Mia ❤️
You both are sooo cute together it made me tear up. Really so happy for you! Best wishes for this couple ✨
"I have an EXTRA button undone."

Mia and Stuart thank you so much! It’s an absolute honor that your fiancé is comfortable enough to do a video! Watching the video was so much fun ❤️
OMG I LOVE YOU BOTH GUYS YOURE SO FUNNY 😭 AND LOOKING GREAT TOGETHER 🥺

He is so lovely,  you guy's are so cute together and are genuinely perfect for each other. What an absolute sweetheart and I loved how he just looked at you all the time 😍. He's totally smitten and you are with him. He is definitely how I pictured he would be and I immediately thought or Shawn Mendes actually.
Jacob elordi
Two things. First, I have a totally unfounded theory that sometimes prematurity at birth can effect whether you're like your star sign or not. Second, your fiancee's voice is similar to Tate's.
He looks like Jacob elordi
You guys are so cute together!
he gives me penn badgley vibes like his side profile

He's so lovely! You really make a wonderful couple, it's beautiful to see
stuart has the same face structure as andrew garfield, so kinda similar lol
He looks like Chip in human form, I don’t mean that in a disrespectful way, Chip is adorable!
As far as celebrity doppelganger- maybe Ezra from PLL? Or Cole Sprouse? Not exactly matches, but that's what came to mind.
Hey Stewart! Super nice to meet you!!
13:28 🤣
Not 2 minutes in and Mia’s already warping Stuart’s face 😂😂😂
You guys are so cute! Stewart is giving me Skandar Keynes vibes. He was Edmund in the lion the witch and the wardrobe movies.
also mia STOP going to the chiro. your back is hurting because chiros are bad and not actually science
He almost looks like joe from “You” on Netflix
losing my MIND right now mia. seconds before you said you wanted to know if stuart looked like any celebrities, i was just thinking about how he looked like penn badgley (not sure on spelling, sorry! think gossip girl and joe from you). insane!!
hahaha he didnt want ur # but mia was like....giiirl....put me on ur team
I thought I would never see the day!!
Awww you two are so cute individually and together. Sweet guy and he's cute! I couldn't think of a doppelganger. I find Stuart's look to be unique.
Omg! Is that Shawn Mendes….lol congrats you guys!
"i wish you would take risks" ".. i have an extra button undone" I LOVE IT haha
You both suit each other really well, and also you can tell he’s secretly funny but isn’t showing it because he’s pretty nervous naturally! Love how happy you both are!!!

When he said “I have an extra button undone” i was sold 😂😂😂 Mia you found a good man

Nice to meet you Stuart, I hope you make Mia very happy for the rest of both of your lives and vice versa 💕
When I 1st saw him, I thought he looks a lot like Trudeau, like he can be his son or something.
😊💖
Idk why but with the blurred out face I always thought he would look like shawn Mendes
“I’m like his mom and he likes you more” Welcome to motherhood, Mia 🙂
He looks like Penn Badgley and Elijah Wood combined
My first husband was a gemini (he was charming but sometimes the other side would come out.mutability is changeability)  I am a pisces.  We were very happy and very compatible.  Unfortunately he lost a fight with leukemia.  My current husband is a Taurus, very different from that Gemini, but still cherishes me and that's what a Pisces loves!  Don't worry.  You are both compatible with each other.  So happy to Meet your Sweetie Mia!
Thank you for sharing this with us, your fiancé seems like a very nice person and it looks like you two have a really wholesome relationship💕 btw I really think he looks a lot like Matpat
finally I've been waiting thank you
Very sweet to know Stuart your fiancé
Oh my god, you guys are adorable!!! In love already!! 🥰🥰🥰 but, I think Stewart looks a little bit like James Marsden!!

İ just realized i had the huge grin  watching this😂 So cute. You are adorable together and the energy is just beautiful. My husband is Gemini , pure Gemini. But I am Aries, so i have no idea if we match or not
I love them 🥺🤍

Im so happy for Mia!! They look so in love, so happy Mia is happy, she deserves it! Also to me Stuart look like Jacob Elordi
“I have an extra button undone” 😂 literally my husband lmao 🤣
Honestly I think Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield a bit which is funny cause he wasn't his favourite spiderman 😄 I'm glad Mia's so happy, he seems like a lovely person, congrats ❤
YOU ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER AAAAAA 😍Also he reminds me a tiny bit of Gregg Sulkin  and a famous actor that doesn't come to mind
Why am I tearing up like you’re my bestie and you’re telling all about your love story 🥺
Thank you SO MUCH Stuart for letting us meet you!! Means so much to us (and to Mia too I’m sure). Can’t wait to see more of you and get to know your personality more! So happy for you two!!🧡
Something about you guys seem so similar! You are perfect for each other ❤️
I know no one cares bcos it means very little honestly but it’d be fun if mia did more of a deep dive into her chart and loved one’s astrology charts bcos the sun sign alone is just a blanket term for your personality (that’s why it seems hit or miss you as a person are too complicated to be described with just one sign and the main signs mean different things like the moon sign is how you are with close friends and loved ones and the rising sign is more how people perceive you) and i bet her other signs are compatible with her loved ones or make her personality compatible
A young Steve Buscemi
One word adorable 😍
Stuart looks like Greg sulkin! From wizards of waverly place

The fact you don't  have any dislike it means you are doing really good girl!!
He’s cute!! Congrats 😝
I kind of see a slight Jack and/or Finn Harries😅 Not that "famous" anymore maybe.. but i guess🙈😂 Cutest couple EVER❤️ Sending love
I was really curious what your fiancé looks like and didn’t ask you to show him to your channel. But here I am watching peanut and stubby together! Y’all so cute❤️☺️
Plz tell me he looks like Zach Pincince
NOT HIM ASKING WHAT IS TULE PLEASE HAHAHA You guys are indeed a match made in heaven
Yay! We finally meet Stewart! Thanks for doing this! 😄 I can't believe no one asked what he does for a living? I'm curious to know !  Anyways it was great to finally get to know who's Mia's fiancé!
It's so funny the Spidey question came up, cause I had literally just been thinking that Stuart looks like if Tobey and Andrew G. had a lovechild 😂😂  (and I promise I mean that in the best and least creepy way possible! 😊 )
He looks like Zach Pincince
Yay!!! We love Stuart!! He should change his last name so he can be part of the Maple tree 😂 Mia maples cannot change
please i’m so happy for them. thanks for letting us meet you!   edit: stuart looks like penn badgley!!
I don’t think he actually looks like “joe” from the show “You” but whenever his face was blurred that’s what I thought he looked like
omg his gift to Mama Maples :’) that made me tear up a little.   I’d say he looks like a mix of Shawn Mendes and Penn Badgley lol
He seems really great and you guys look so cute together!! I like that you can be your fun self with him! ❤️❤️❤️
You guys are so cute together. I'm happy you both found eachother. You two vibe so well!
That's Zach Pincince Omg he hypnotizes people that famous
I loved this video! Stuart seems like such a good and sweet guy. I really feel super happy for you both. I wish you all the best!
Thank you Stuart 😊.
He looks just like young jack from the jacksgap channel
he looks like David Tennant!
Not exactly looks spot on but I was getting major Edward Cullen vibes lol and my brain had to pick another character that you'd fit kia, and you'd be that blonde chick Anna Kendrick.
This isnt risky enough? I have an extra button undone 😂😂😂
this was soooo cuteeeee love the chemistry between you too, i wish you both so much happiness <3
Congrats again Mia and Sturt!!! Very happy for you. It was so nice to get to know a little about Stuart and finally get to see his face. Wish you a lifetime of happness.

Such a precious couple♡♡  I love his name! Not a ton of Stuarts in the world lol  PS you should do your entire charts. It makes so much more sense that way
When you said wait for it there was an add right after. The suspense!
He looks like Gregg Sulkin!!

UGH MIA!!!🥺🥺🥺🥺 he’s so reserved but so sweet and so good for you!!!! 🥺😍
Might be just me, but I definitely got Penn Badgley/Joe Goldberg “You” vibes from Stuart! Very soft spoken, adorable front tooth gap, great smile… Loved the video, Mia! Can’t wait to see more of Stuart in the future. Congrats to you both! ❤️😸
OMG, who would’ve thought knowing get into yuh my doja cat is in Mia’s Spotify wrap madeeee my wholeeee day😊😂

He kind of resembles Joshua Bassett lol:)
You guys are so cute, I can’t wait to see more of you guys.  😊😁
First of all you two are adorable together ❤️ I feel like he looks so much like someone but I can quite put my finger on it. Eric from that 70s shows? Steve from blues clues?
jacob elordi : The kissing Booth
YESSS I LOVE YOU GUYS

He looks like Joshua basset lol you guys are a cute couple
Hi Stuuu 😊

Mia "I LOVE when people say I'm funny" Stuart (immediately) "you're hilarious" 😍  Such an easy going couple and excited to welcome your best friend into your videos. Hi Stuart!

Wahhhh I accidentally disliked while trying to share with my mom and my niece 😫😫 def switched back to liked ASAP
Mia to answer your question: Stuart definitely reminds me of a mix between Drew Gooden (they’re soo similar) and Shawn Mendes! Basically a walking green flag. You two make a lovely couple, so happy seeing you happy 🤍
You guys are adorable together.
What a cute video of you and Stewart, Mia! 💕 Such a wholesome couple and then there is some nasty person(s) that feels compelled to put links to pornography on your channel. Poor lost soul(s), sure wish they’d get a life!  Absolutely annoying that they do that!
So happy for the two of you!!! You look sooooo cute together, it just makes sense!! As for Stewart, I think he really looks like Andrew Garfield!!
He looks and gives the feeling of being perfect for her 😍
Stuart looks exactly like joe Goldberg. When I first saw him that’s literally all I could see, and now I can’t unsee it hahahaha. Also you guys are so cute together and I am so happy for you both. I couldn’t imagine Mia with a better man❤️
He looks a little bit like Bradley James!
Fist thing that came to my mind was drake from drake and josh 🤣🤷🏽‍♀️
The way he looks at her 😩
Shawn Mendes twin 🤩🤩 so cute!!

You're such a cute couple. You compliment each other. Stewart may have been nervous being on camera but he did so great. You can definitely see how much he loves you. You also can see how happy you each make each other. It was great to finally get to meet Stewart
This was so fun to watch! I think he looks like Andrew Garfield
ok but how they look at each other… SO CUTE
You guys look so sweet together. Also, not sure if it was just me, but the audio on this video was really quiet, especially in comparison to the ads.
You two make such a lovely couple and look so good together! Yay for Stuart’s debut 🥰🥰
Thank you Stuart for wanting to be in a video!! Y’all are so cute 🥺😭
He looks like a cuter Matt Bennett from 2021
I think his celebrity doppelgänger is Penn Badgley!
I'm so glad we finally got to meet your Fiance
aww he’s so cute I can total see that he’s husband material 💕 you’re so cute together!
Hi Stuart or is it Stewart, welcome to our YouTube family and your new chosen family. It’s so nice to see and hear you interact with your chosen one.
That gut from the hobbit what's his name
He looks like a mix between young Eric Banner, Timothee Chalamet and Johnny Depp!
oh god me when
He looks like Andrew Taggart but except for the eyes  Love u two together 💞💕
He is so lovely! Very happy for you both 😊
I feel like at certain angles he looks like Joshua Bassett!!
I'm a Gemini
YAYYYY I AM SO EXCITED OH MY GOSH. YOU ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER.. HE SEEMS SO SWEET
idk who stuart looks like but you look so much like kat mcnamara
Jeremy bilding
You guys are so cute together !! He seems super nice!
He looks like he could be the next Spiderman (literally an Andrew Garfield- Tom Holland mashup), he has that like (and I mean this in the BEST way possible) awkward/dorky charm that makes people like you easily
super cute couple :)
You should look up his chart ! The time he was born and where are needed for it but I’d look at multiple charts to see cause I was born September 22nd which is the cutoff for Virgo but when I was born it was in Libra so yeah ! I’d look his chart up
HE LOOKS LIKE PENN BADGLEY - I cannot unsee this
Aggghgjghghhhhh. So freaking cute Mia.  You guys are perfect 🥰🖤🎉
I knew I liked him for you when he said "I have an extra button undone"  🤣😂 Stewart welcome!!!
I am also Gemini/Taurus cusp so Stewart (Stuart?) and I may share a birthday!
Liked the video before I even started watching it. So happy and excited for you!! ☺️❤️
He seems to be such a nice person! Congratulations to you two, again☺️
U both look so attractive bruh proud of u Stuart!!
loved this video! Also I think Stuart looks a bit similar to David Tennant (he's a celebrity in the UK idk if you know him ahah)
I think this is the first time I’ve vehemently disagreed with Mia…Toby??? Really??? TOBY??? With tho hesitation?
Does anybody else think he looks like Matpat?
You two are so cute!!!!!!!!!
I thought he was the main singer of the vamps for a second😂😂
He looks like matpat  (I mean this with love)
Me and my husband are the same, I’m a pisces and hes a gemini and I swear hes not gemini like either! We’re definitely compatible though ❣️
I think Stuart looks like MatPat from Game Theory lol..
He kind of looks like the British boyfriend on Wizards of Waverly Place 😆 So happy for Mia ❤️
how is it that he’s exactly what i expected but also not what i expected
I see resemblance with Penn Badgley... maybe its the shirt and t shirt combo :'). You guys are the cutest and I wish you nothing but happiness x
He looks like a young, skinnier Zach Galifanakis
OMG please do a video of you dressing your fiancé!!!
So happy to meet you Stewart! You have a super special Lady there! Take good care of her !
SO glad you asked us if he looks like a celebrity because I was planning on commenting one already! He reminds me SO MUCH of Gregg Sulkin!
He is so sweet
This was adorable. I think he looks like the actor joe from you.
Yes! Omg! Yes! This is the best day! It’s so nice to get to meet you!
I don't know why but i got Christian Borle/Emmet from legally blonde on broadway vibes from him. Personality like emmet in the broadway version and voice like the actor (christian)
Stewart, you seem like an absolute sweetheart. You did great. I'm always nervous about being on camera myself, but I've never been in a YouTube video. I'd probably be a nervous wreck, lol. You guys are so cute together. I'm so happy for both of you. Also, as for Zodiac signs, I'm a Gemini and my husband is a Cancer. We are considered highly incompatible but we will have been together almost 23 years now.
I have a feeling like he looks like Robert Pattinson a little bit!!!! Btw you guys are so cute🥰
Mia....the purpose of the Wedding is to become his Wife! And start your lives together! But.....I'm sure he will be blown away when he sees you in your dress and all made up so pretty! Because you are a very beautiful young lady! And the closer that day comes, both of you will get more and more excited! 😊❤👍
As far as celebrity look alike for Stewart I got Robert Patterson vibes
Could not stop smiling this whole video! Thank you so much 😊
You are the cutest couple ever! 🥰💕
I think it's amazing you kept it private for so long to strengthen the relationship and bond before introducing publicly. Veronica Merrell Burris and Aaron Burris did the same and just posted 3 amazing video's dating proposal and their wedding video it's so smart to be private for so long and it's so amazing to finally have your partner be a part of such a huge part of your life on camera. Congratulations to this and a life full of love and life❤️
He's giving me the Superman vibe. He is Clark Kent and Mia is Lois Lane. Such a powerful lovely couple! <3
OH my gosh I loved this! You guys are adorable together. BUT I was thinking it would be SO cute to have you do a video where you both react to comments from this video! The comments are so loving and sweet but I think it would be funny to see what he thinks of what we think... if that makes sense haha LOVE YOU
This is weird but in the thumbnail with his face blurred out he kinda looks like Edward from twilight lol
I’m so happy for miaaaaaa
You can tell he’s obviously not comfortable in front of the camera, but even then you can tell he’s absolutely head over heals over Mia. What a lovely couple!! Wishing you both all the best! ❤️
Haven’t even watched it yet but I’m so happy for you Mia!
The way you guys look at each other is adorable! I think that he kind of resembles Dave Franco!
aww mia i’m so happy for you. it seems like he’s a very nice guy and perfect for you. I wish y’all the best :)
He looks like the guy that played barty crouch jr in Harry potter mixed with joel courtney
This just made my whole day! So happy for you both ❤️
Stuart's doppelgänger is MatPat, and also Brandon Flowers!
yall are too cute I can't
This whole video all I could think is how much Stuart looks like Freddie Highmore! But hello Stuart so glad to finally see you on the channel!!
He has the right idea having mama Mia on his side lol
He is the sweetest!!!!!
Now don’t worry, this is a very nice compliment to Stuart but he reminds me SOOOO much of Erik Stocklin (Colleen Ballinger’s husband) same look, same vibe, both are very calm and shy. I love it.
He looks like Joe from you, his face to his clothes to his teeth even!
You are so cute together! Stuart seems like a lovely person and I‘m so happy for you 😭🧡
I’m on the cusp of Taurus/ Gemini we are can adapt to other signs. Because if I don’t like one sign I just go with the other! I don’t believe anything of that either!
Imagine Mia's babies 🥺💖🙏😭
Awww this was such a sweet video, hi Stuart.
“I have an extra button undone” 😂😂😂 I can tell how hilarious they’re together ♥️
Immediately after seeing his face I thought Penn Badgley lol
Mia in her pyjamas “I wish you would take some risks” bruh 😂😂😂🤣🤣
stewart looks like straight hair penn badgley
he looks like matthew patrick
Congratulations 🎉 You guys make an adorable couple. Respect for Stewart getting past the nerves to join you in a video.
Your philosophy about liking someone is great, but some of us have horror stories that hinder that kind of thinking. I have a few, but the biggest one was in 8th grade my crush found out I liked him. It was the last day of school and our last class was gym. Toward the end of class a group of girls told me he like me and wanted to go out with me. I didn't trust it so I said "no", but one of the girls yelled across the gym "She said yes". He came over with everyone in tow and told me that he would never go out with me. That I was ugly. etc. He did his best to humiliate me and I just stood there silently while he cruelly rattled on. When he was finished insulting me I just defiantly said "I said no" and walked away. He ended up looking like a fool and everyone made fun of him because his plan backfired, and I rejected him first. After that I had a hard time trusting any guy that asked me out or claimed to like me. I probably turned down at least half a dozen guys in high school because they were popular like he was and I figured they were just trying to embarrass me like he tried. I wish I had just been able to say "I like you. So what. If you don't like me that fine." but I was painfully shy back then and still am more of an introvert even today.
Stuart is adorable....and they look so cute together! He seems to adore Mia. And Mia seems to adore him. 😊❤👍
He is sooo cute! I love you two together! I NEED more Stuart Little videos!  Ps he looks like Robert Pattinson and Daniel Radcliffe’s love child.
I feel like he reminds me of a younger version of the dad from Full House, like he could be the actor’s son.   Also it was so sweet of him to come on even though he’s more private and was a bit nervous. Shows he really cares for you.
This was friggin adorable.<3 Oh and I'd go with a mixture of a young Hugh Grant and Andrew Garfield.
This makes so much sense. Love you two for each other
Nice to meet him!!! Honestly you guys are perfect for each other. I’m so happy for you mia you look so safe with him!!
Ahhh you two are so cute! And I think he is a very sweet person
Omgoodness hes so cute! I was hoping you'd find someone that was comfortable with what you did for a living. The opener really got me with the sharpay thing. Happy for you!
They look like rapunzel and flin
Hi Stewart! Welcome to our YouTube family :) we’ve been waiting for you!
Stuart looks just like MatPat!
So cute together!
Andrew Garfield!!!!
Kind of looks like Gregg sulkin and Matt patt had a baby
Stuart looks like Jack and Finn Harris, along with Greg Sulkin! 🤣
Miaaaaaa 👀 Like Stuart little lol I love it ♥️  congratulations ♥️
You guys are so in love!! It's screaming from your faces and body language! It's amazing to finally meet him, welcome ☺🤗
I feel like he has a similar face to both MattPat from Game Theory here on YouTube and Timmothy Shalomet or however that guys name is spelled
It’s the nicknames for meee 😂💕 not that cringy, they’re actually adorable lol Stewart kinda reminds me of Joe Goldberg LIKE OMG the clothes, the hair, the resemblance!!
I would love to see a baking decoration competition! You two go head to head and decorate a cake!! It can be completely creative or there can be a category/topic so y’all’s would be somewhat similar!
OKAY!! loved the vid! I think his face resembles Josh O'connor and same with his hair!!
I LOVE HIM!!! I cannot wait to see him in more videos 🥰🥰🥰
Oh my gosh!! It's so wonderful to meet Stuart!! I'm just so happy for you two - you seem like such a great match.
when i first clicked on the video i was like "IS THAT SHAWN MENDES?"
He kind of reminds me of Gregg Sulkin!   You guys seems perfect for eachother, so happy for you two!
Mia "I wish you would take more risks" Stuart "I have a EXTRA BUTTON undone"  🤣🤣🤣 I love him already
You guys are so adorable, it's so nice to meet Stuart! I hope everyone here treats him well and he feels so welcomed!
I was thinking all throughout the video he reminds me of someone. Couldn’t think for the life of me but as soon as he said Johnny Depp- yes! But more specifically edward scissor hands! Not a diss, deffo a compliment😂✂️❤️
Y'all are so cute 🥰🥰🥰
He kinda looks like Daniel Radcliffe aka Harry Potter!  Nice to meet you Stuart you seem like a great guy...Mia is a lucky girl!
As a taurus, Stuart has major Taurus energy. It might be his rising sign
What was the first song you played fromyour spotify miaa?
Welcome  ! Great to meet you !
You asked if he looks like any celebrity… there’s one I IMMEDIATELY thought of the second I saw his face, without purposefully trying to compare him to any celebrity - and that’s Jacob Elordi (Nate Jacobs in Euphoria) !! He looks just like him I SWEAR.   He has a very familiar face though so he honestly looks like so many celebrities. Some others I can think of are the guy that plays Joe in “You”, Shawn Mendes a little bit, John Mayer, but Jacob Elordi is his doppelgänger for sure!!
Our girl did good!
He seems like such a good guy! I'm so happy for you Mia and congrats to you both for finding each other such a cute couple!! ☺❤
Omg to me Stuart looks like Jack and Finn Harris! The twins from JacksGap YouTube channel!
I think he looks like Daniel Doheny ... who looks like Andrew Garfield.
You guys are guna make beautiful Babies one day…. God sounds like my motherrrr
He's so shy. It's 😍 cute, ya'll are a adorable couple 💑
He looks so handsome and seems sooooo sweet😭❤️
I can’t imagine introducing myself to 3 million people, good job Stuart ur doing great sweetie
He's the calm that our "running around" Mia needed.❤️  PS. so glad we get to meet you soon enough, imagine the torture blurring away all the wedding videos 😂
He seems so sweet, I'm so happy for you Mia- you are incredibly kind and funny and it looks like you found someone who appreciates that and can support your dreams. Can't want to see more videos with the both of you. It's really great that he and Mama Maples get on well too Also can I say your brother is the brother I wish I had, mine is such a sh*tty human. Happy New Year!
Giraffe
A bit like Chris Carrabba from the band Dashboard Confessional. Thanks for sharing some insight into you two, Mia - and thanks to Stuart :) Seem well-suited :) Wish you both all the happiness <3
For zodiac signs you have to look at your whole chart, specially your moon (emotions) and Venus(how you are in a relationship) and mercury(communication) for relationship compatibility

Stuart reminds me of Mia’s dad/ brothers. He seems like he would easily fit into the family
You guys are so cute together & he seems like a good guy, I love how he looks at you Mia! Congratulations!!
I think Stewart looks a little like Scott Wolf from when he was on the TV show, Party of 5, back in the 90's.
He seems a really nice man, respectful, kind, sweet, he looks perfect for you, congratulations!!!
I think it’s safe to say I speak for everyone when I say this: We love him. ♥️

And I will be a lookout on his “look alike” … but for right now he’s a mixture of Tom cruise and Harry Potter lol
Stuart looks like Jacob Elordi!!

This was so cute to watch!! You look so happy together and I can't wait to see more of Stewart in the future! Btw I think he looks just like Gregg Sulkin from when he played Mason on Wizards of Waverly Place
This has been the best match I have ever seen! Talk about finding your complement! So happy for ya'll!
So cute. Fits right in with the maples family. Also looks slightly like andrew garfield and matpat mixed.
Why I am smiling the entire video? 😂😂 OMG you guys so cute and stuart was so shy in the beginning of the video but in the end he was more comfortable and another thing: is everyone see that me mia and stuart look like each other or just me? 😂😂
You guys are literally perfect together! Two kind souls, and the way you are looking at each other.. I’m so happy for both of you. 🥺❤️
mia it feels like your boyfriend and mom have exactly the same humor, no wonder they get along so well! <3
We had already seen him so many times, in Jacob Elordi. HE LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE HIM! Anyway, i love seeing you two. I hope you guys will have an amazing life together. Love you xoxo
Her fiance is kewl
OH MY GODDDD THE CUTEST COUPLE OF ALL TIIIIIIME
CUTE!!!!!
He seems so nice, glad he was comfortable enough to come on a video he did so well. I’d of been so awkward. Take care x
Stewarts music taste is ✨immaculate✨ im sure hes very nervous being in the lime light but he seems so chill and genuine. I can tell he is a very liked person
Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield with a bit of Shawn Mendes. Can anyone else see it 💕
Cute couple. My fiancé is also a Pisces and I'm a Gemini x
I get major Edward Cullen vibes from his looks 😅
Stuart looks like Tommy Lee (when he was young, minus the tattoos and long rocker hair). That would make a great Halloween costume for you both to dress up like Pam and Tommy.
he's giving me john krasinski for sure
3:05 Stuart's comment that cemented in my heart his rightful place as king to our mia!
Could not stop grinning the entire time ❤ He resembles Dave Franco for sure!
“Stewart and Chip” sounds like it could be a tv show! 😅❤️
ALSO YES THANK YOU FOR HYPING HER UP WITH US STUART YOU’RE A REAL ONE
Mia words cannot express how much I love you and how happy I am for you, you definitely deserve eachother you're such an amazing human and hearing how sentimental loving and amazing he is from your q&a and engagement stories im so happy you guys found eachother he seems like such a cool guy and I dont feel like us fans have to worry because we can tell he has/will treat you right he seems like such a down to earth guy and NOT one of those cocky self-obsessed "alpha" het men IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU. He is adorable just like the rest of your family and friends ilysm.
He’s so cute!!!! Can’t wait to see him in more videos once he feels more comfortable
I'm so excited and happy that he finally agreed to be in a video!😱 He looks exactly like I imagined him. He kinda looks like Gregg Sulkin to me. He is a very attractive man! You two fit perfectly together😊 I'm looking forward to seeing him in more future videos
Get someone who looks at you the way stuart looks at mia.
Omg yall are just so cute!!
OMG, what a lovely couple!!!~
hes so adorable!!! much love to you both uwu<3
Your mother's reaction 😂😂
You are both gorgeous and kind! Congratulations and thank you for the introduction!
Omg!!!!! He's freaking cute..🥰..... I'm Soo happy for you Miaaaa....
"I wish you'd take more risks" "I have an extra button undone" 😭😭
Finally! And to answer your celebrity question, my girlfriend and I think he looks like Barty Crouch Jr. from Harry Potter and the goblet of fire.
Celebrity lookalike: Zach Woods from Silicon Valley!
My first thought was: "Oh, he's the real life Edward Cullen!" You guys should do a Twilight lookbook together and recreate iconic outfits or pictures as Edward and Bella.. 🤭
I dont know why but Mia's fiancé gives me Andrew Garfield vibes, he kinda looks like him
You guys are cute together, congratulations 🎊  He seems really nice
I think he looks like young Andrew Lowe (on YouTube) ❤️
💕💕💕💕💕💕 just pure love 💕💕💕💕💕💕
So cute! I'm happy for you guys :)
He looks so much like MatPat
I follow the Arnold sisters some and I think Stewart favors Jensens husband Topher. Not necessarily a doppelgänger but looks like the smiles could be related.   What a sweet couple you guys make.  So happy for your new life together.  Be blessed.
Glad to meet you Stuart!
SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH.
I find he looks like Robert Paterson but particularly Edward Cullen lol
Is Stewart Brazilian by any chance? I have a lot of people in my extended family on my husbands side that are from Brazil but have lived in the states for a while and idk just the way he talks and his mannerisms remind me a lot of the men in my husbands family that are Brazilian?!? 🤷‍♀️
He looks to me like he could be the next  Spider man. Am I the only one?
so he's not a conventional celebrity but, I think Stuart looks like MatPat from YouTube!
"it-adori Yuji" ┐( ˘_˘)┌
He looks terrified
This felt very correct <3
This was the happiest and sweetest video ever. Thank you for sharing your love and friendship with us. It's lovely to see you both filled with so much joy! I will definitely be watching this a few times, even if just to take in all the cuteness. 🥰
Yesssss lo-fi hip hop 🔥
he 100% looks like gregg sulkin . and he’s so nice !!! congrats to the both of you !
Tooobey!!!
YOU GUYS ARE PERFECT
Whats his moon sign bestie
HE LOOKS LIKE PENN BADGLEY!!!
So glad he agreed to come on!  Thanks for sharing!!!! Great video!
These questions are so good! If I made videos I would wanna use these same questions cuz they sparked such good answers and conversation
He's such a Sweetheart 🌸
What a perfect match 🙌🏼 I’m so happy for you both ♥️
Mia I think he lowkey looks like Jacob Elordi!
tobey best spider-man
This was so cute, I hope Stuart gets more comfortable with being on camera and us. Love the both of you, and he kinda looks like Ian Harding to me.
matpat jr omg
My first reaction what I saw him is that he looks like a celebrity from his side profile but I really cant remember what celebrity he reminds me of
He looks like Robert Paterson form twilight or joe from you
he’s so cute omg
Stuart is such a cute and unique name. Ah, you guys are prefect! Love you 😊🥰
Thanks so much for being in the video! It takes alot to come out of privacy and not only that but then answer questions! Props to you, Stuart and nice to meet you!!! and also if he is a cusp baby he is technically both and can fall more into one than the other... I am a cusp baby and for sure have more traits from the other sign than the one I am "labeled"  by most  And certain looks he gets on his face he reminds me of a younger version of lucifer(Tom Ellis) but more like his son than doppelganger
This was the cutest video omg ❤🥺   Stewart looks like Mat Pat from Game Theory! I honestly had to do a double take when you first showed his face!
Congrats guys!! So excited for you two and you guys seem like such a great couple! Sorry if Stuart felt pressured but I’m so happy we got to meet him, thank you💗
Missed opportunity...relation-chip!!
Such a sweet couple!
You two are so sweet together 😚 thank you for sharing your special one Mia too 💓  (Btw.... I cannot imagine anybody having a bad relationship with your Mum XD )
I love it! He seems super sweet and shy. As for a celebrity he looks like, he sort of reminds me of Freddie Highmore, but with brown eyes.
My mom and my boyfriend both are Pisces and I am a Gemini but I am the most compatible with them I get you Mia 😂
we LOVE him<3
He looks like Penn Badgley. Joe Goldberg from you. Easy. My husband agrees. Especially with the button down shirt hes wearing.

Talking about celebrities... Maybe I see some of Steven R. McQueen in Mia's fiancee XD
Answer to the last question: a combination of the blues clues guy (young Steve Burns) and MatPat

THIS IS ADORABLE
I love him, Mia. Absolute perfection ✨

Stuart looks like Jonah from the show superstore!!
At the beginning it felt kind of weird, because I expected such a different person. But the dynamic between you two started to show later on.  I’m mostly so happy that you guys are happy and it’s fun to meet your fiance!  Hope your future together would be amazing ♥️

Hi Stuart! Glad you've made an appearance and hope to see more of you!
I think Stuart has a slight resemblance to David Tennant?
Love you together. Omg lol i was just going to write about a video idea .. baking together.. sending much love from Nebraska
You know couples r meant to be when they look like siblings 🤣
This was super cute and he seems really nice! :)
I'm 10 seconds and already freaking out!! ALSO YEYYYY  HE HAS AN ACTUAL FACE 😍😂
Wait... now I need to know why he didn’t let your brother give you his number that one time??? 😂

He looks so much like MatPat

I smiled the entire video. Im crying because im so happy for the both of you. You can tell that you two really love each other. I truly and deeply wish you two all of God's blessings and a happy, healthy life together ❤
NEVER CLICKED ON ONE OF MIA’S VIDEOS SO FAST!!!
You two are SO cute together!! 🥰 Ave his doppelganger is Andrew Garfield for sure, Which is so funny because of you guys taking about Spiderman 💯
I think Stuart looks like Judd Nelson from the Breakfast club. The same nose.
So cute and I love how happy they are and they will be, congrats ! ✨
stweart looks a little like shawn Mendes. I think it's the hair lol
Beautiful couple ❤️
Stuart looks similar to a or a mixture of celebrities but I can't put my finger on it
Love the chemistry u both have !
Awe he is cute and you 2 are super cute together.
I think he looks like Joe Goldberg from the show "You" (im not sure of the actors actual name lol)
He is so lovely Mia ☀️
Okay what is your rising sign? That is what is important lol
You guys are so cute !!!!
Who does Stuart look like? Funny thing is when I meet or see someone new I always identify them with a celebrity if they look like one!😂 And don’t take this the wrong way, Stuart’s nose reminds me of Me. Bean’s nose😂😅, but he does not look like him! Just the nose!! For the rest, he could pass as Ben Feldman’s little brother? So there you go. If you see this comment and find it funny could you give it a thumbs up?😅 Luv Ya ❤️
Cutest video ever! Stewart is adorable só nervous ... Mia is in Love just look at the way she looks at him... you make a sweet couple! Love to me you Stewart.  Love you both♥️💗
He does look like a celebrity! He looks like Linguini from Ratatouille - so a fiction celebrity. But still famous as far as I’m concerned.
I wanna find someone who looks at me the same way he looks at her... So sweet! Love youuuu both!
100% looks like David Tennant
He literally seems so sweet! Congratulations to the both of you! (Also ya he seems more like a Taurus)
You guys are so cute 🤍

I think He looks like a younger version of the dad on 7th Heaven
OMG i love this video❤❤❤❤❤❤
You are so sweet together!!
This is the sweetest most amazing video. Yall are so cute together
I see a little Rick Nelson and a little Tim Considine. I'm a baby boomer so I'm quite a bit older than you two so cut me some slack. I think you two make such a cute couple. Can't wait to possible see more wedding preparations.
Stuart just looks so kind and his demeanor is so calming and gentle. I just know he’s even more fun and full of life off camera as well. I absolutely LOVE you two!!!!💖
I smiled the whole way through!!! You guys are truly a match made in heaven!!🤍
U guys make such cute couple!!
Congratulations y'all!  Thank you both for the video - It's so comforting and inspiring to see how much love there is between you two!  Regarding Celebrity Lookalikes, I feel like if David Tennant and Tom Holland were brothers, Stuart would definitely be the 3rd brother!  I wish you both an abundance of joy and blessings in your life together!! <3
I’m swooning over how cute they are together 😍♥️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I think Tom Holland is the best Spiderman!
Miaaaa , decorate that wicker shelf , or hand it over to meeeee ! 👁👄👁

PLEASE DO A WHO KNOWS ME BEST W MOMMA MAPLES
Tell me why I was looking forward to this all week !!! I’m at work rn and excitedly took my lunch 🥺🥺🥺
Maybe it's just me, but I think he looks like a mix of the Dutch singer Duncan Laurence (winner Eurovision 2019) and Penn Badgley 😂
Im not sure what celebrity he looks like, but his personality and the way he talks reminds me so much of Tate!
The fact that you chose him and that your family approves is the only seal of approval I need. Congrats!
he looks like Gregg Sulkin! who is 😍
Did it ever cross your mind that maybe it’s you that isn’t a true Pisces and that’s why you get a long so well lol
We love him for you, Mia! He’s seems so sweet and genuine, hope to see him in more videos soon!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Stuart is as wonderful as Mia! We knew! Now we really know! Thanks for coming on!
Why are the lights so flipping bright?
Me a Taurus. Girl I know you're not coming for us 😂 we will claim Stuart, he seems really sweet and you guys together are adorable. Mia you're surrounded by love so it would make sense to pick a partner that has a loving trait.
He looks like actor Adam Scott from Step Brothers. Thats the first thing that came to mind when I saw him. And then at the end when Mia asked who he looks like I was like omg I need to comment this lol
Does anyone else think he looks like Tom Holland a little lol
A really good relationCHIP
he looks a little like Skandar Keynes :)
So proud of him for getting on camera. No mean comments everywhere! I’m happy for the both of y’all.
I feel like Stuart looks like Flynn rider from tangled
Stewart/Stuart I’m so happy he is like so full of life… he has an awesome personality 🙌

Am I the only one who is reminded of Joe....?
“Your body that’s falling apart” I’m crying he’s amazing 😂
**Watches 2 seconds* *Immediately yes. I’ve seen what I’ve needed to see, and it’s a yes. Immediately yes.*
He looks like Gregg Sulkin
Omg he looks a lot like those oldschool british youtubers finn and jack harries!
Okay! I think Stuart looks like a mix of Blake Michael (who plays Charlie in Disneys lemonade mouth) and Matt Prokop (who plays Josh in Disneys Geek Charming) also his hair definitely gives Andrew Garfield vibes! Haha hopefully this feels somewhat accurate to you 😆❤️ Thanks for being in a video! Love u Mia!
He reminds me of Edward Cullen/Rob Pattinson, in THE BEST WAY EVER. You guys are so cute together! I'm so happy for you, Mia. ❤
ohhh my gooodness 😍
I love that you guys have the same cute goofy giggly personalities! You can tell by how he looks at you and enjoys being close to you  just how much he cares and adores you! 😍
Penn Badgley Vibes🥰🥰🥰🥰
He looks dead on like Matpat from game theory
Why do I wanna cry 🥺I love it !!
SO CUTEEEEE
He does not give Gemini energy at all.
Guys you are so sweet together ❤️
He’s so perfect for you love you two together
We really appreciate Stewart being in one of your videos! Just know to never feel pressured to share more of your personal lives than what you are comfortable with and we just want you two to be happy and comfortable. 💚

Taurus gang where you at♉
He is so sweettttt just like you mia ❤️❤️❤️
I think he looks like Robert Pattinson. I said it right away!
Omg, he looks like David Tennant :))) (Best compliment I could ever give :)) )
Great job Stuart!
He's not like a gemini because zodiac signs make no sense 😏
He definitely look like an actor
My husband is gemini but I never thought he fit the sign well. Someone told me he might be gemini moon (don't @ me if idk what I'm talking about lol) which seems to fit his personality more.
Ahhh I love this! He definitely reminds me of Jacob Elordi from The Kissing Booth and I was thinking this the entire video!!
Thanks for introducing Stewart😍 I love the energy!!
Eyes truly speak for themselves! Congrats again and Stuart you got a good one!✨Also, his doppelgänger is definitely Shawn Mendes🤍
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ so happy for you both!!!!
So nice to Finally meet you Stuart, even though you where nervous it didn't come across on camera, you did extremely well for a first video. It feels like finally meeting the missing piece of the puzzle. your seriously just the nicest guy and obviously love Mia so much. Welcome to your extended family!!
Stewart looks like Greg sulkin!
Also, to answer your celebrity question, I don’t know the name of the actor but the character I could come up with is Jeremy Gilbert from The Vampire Diaries?
i feel like he kinda looks like Gregg Sulkin
OMG he is so cute!!! Yall are amazing together yoh sbwl 😭
Haha, yep, Stuart is Hugh Grant 💜 You guys are cool!
He looks like he’ll age well. I approve!
HE LOOKS LIKE DOMINIC SHERWOOD FROM VAMPIRE ACADEMY AND TAYLOR SWIFTS MUSIC VIDEO (STYLE I THINK???)
They are soyyyy cute🥺🥺🥺❤❤❤
the way he looks at her, i cant even its so loving😭😭😭✋
You look super cute together and he seems to be a very nice and caring guy. :) Celebrity? I think he looks a little bit like Joe from "You"
He fits right in with Mia's family, they look related and his voice has a similar tone of voice as Mia's brother Tate.
I only have one word for this video. ADORABLE.
He really did me think of Edward from twilight! So cute how he looks to you, you really can see that he loves you.
“i have an extra button undone” with a full t shirt on understand 🤣🤣🤣 mia yes perfect choice made by the dry humor gods in heaven
He is literally the guy version of you Mia!! So happy for you two!! Can’t wait to see wedding planning videos!!
I Loved this!!!!!  Thank you Stewart for letting us get to know you!!!!  Y’all are a perfect match!!!! I think Stewart is a great mix of Hugh Jackman and Patrick Dempsey!!!! ❤️
Am I the only one that sees Nate from Euphoria 👀👀👀
When I had first saw him I thought of this guy that was on Disney channel when I was younger am ohhhhh Justin from wizards of waverly place (David Henry) or from the side he kinda looks like Andrew garfeild
As soon as I saw him I thought he was matpat
Why does he look like Andrew Garfield…
mia looks like lydia from teen wolf and stuart looks british, idk how to explain that
MIAAAAA I LOVE HIMMMM! This video is so cute I can’t, I love you two together!!! Truly exiting video 🥰
lmao I call my boyfriend peanut!
He seems like such a sweet and attentive guy❤ so happy for you Mia! As celebrities go, I'm getting Shawn Mendes mixed with Charlie Puth vibes
Stuart or Stewart? That is the question..🤔
With all veggies which can get watery...zucchini, eggplant, etc always pat with paper towels well, salt well on both sides then leave for about 15 minutes. Salt pulls out water then pat well again. It helps a lot. You really don't want to call a man "stubby". Talking to a camera is not weird when it comes with the success and income.
OMG!!! I AM SO HAPPY AND EXCITED FOR YOU TWO!!!
Awe he seems like such a sweet and genuine guy. Thank you for letting us get to know him better and thanks you Stewart for being willing to do this video. It's really cute seeing you two together.
When Gemini fall in love is game over for whoever we were in the past and only if we are in love we’ll commit a 100%
Funny you got that Spidy question because I think Stuart (Stewart?) Looks like a mix of Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland.
Stuart looks EXACTLY like Gregg Sulkin!!! (Mason from wizards of waverly place)
Sweet video guys!! So happy for you two! I think He looks like Lucas Bley. He's a Brazilian Instagram influencer. The way he talks is really similar.
stuart/stewart(???) definitely looks like someone!! i cannot put my finger on exactly who, but a few people who come to mind are jack and finn harries and maybe the james and oliver phelps? this video was so lovely to watch, very excited for you two!
Love Stuart, Mia! If he agrees on it, we all would love to get to know him better🤩
So sweet!! Props to Stuart for putting himself out there ❤️
Thank you Stuuuuu! It's so nice to meet you!!!

Stuart look a little bit like Andrew Garfield, he's giving me Spidey vibes Also from the side he looks like Joe from you

He did great!! You two are the cutest and your vibes just visibly match so well and the way he showed sone of his quirks in the very first video he’s showing his face! I think it felt more comfortable for Mia to be there instead of him being by himself in front of the camera. Wishing you endless years together, filled with happiness, love and amazing adventures 💕
You guys are the cutest.. much love for both of you <33
Such a long-awaited video! I know that we’re all happy about meeting him, but I mostly hope that he’s feeling alright with everything now that it’s out there!

So glad he has decided to open with your YouTube career I was worried we'd see less vlog style videos because I understood he wanted privacy
Props for the courage, I could feel your anxiety through the screen but it’s very sweet of you to do this, Stuart/Stewart(???)! To Mia, I think he looks like a cross between Penn Badgley and Bill Hader. Very cute!
To answer your question Mia, I think he looks like a mix of Penn Badgley and Robert Pattinson 😊
He reminds me of Hugh grant when he was young in the movie 9 months
He is so sweet for agreeing to meet us 😭 you guys are adorable and I like him a lot because he makes you happy ❤️

He is so handsome!  Good choice😜
OMG he is soooo handsome😇 thank you for this great video🥰
I'm more excited to see Mia's fiance than I have been in MONTHS.

The way he looks at Mia, oh my gosh that's true love right there! Also he looks exactly like I imagined him! My husband (who pretends to never watch, but Mia video's are actually his guilty pleasure) says he looks like MatPat.
You guys are so cute! Not really a celebrity but I think he looks like Fleur de Force’s husband Mike (a younger version, before his hair went gray) 🤗

Thank you for sharing a little piece of you and your guys relationship ! Woot woot!!! Y’all are so cute 😍😍😍 and he resembles Robert Patterson from twilight
I’m a Gemini and 2/3 of my family and best friends are Pisces for some reason 😂 I think you guys are perfect and such a lovely couple ⭐️💛 Stuart kinda reminds me of Shawn Mendes cause of the hair 😂
Stuart looks like my daughter's 1st boyfriend when she was in her teens. Celeb? Be yourself!  :) <3
Kinda quickly he changed his mind lol Good for us. I didn't think we'd see him until you were married
Video #16 of asking you to cut your hair shorter because you would look absolutely amazing! not that you don't, but you would look so good with shoulder-length or just a bit shorter hair. And I know you've said if you got enough comments to cut your hair you might do it in one of your past videos. Plus you seem to be getting a bit more adventurous with your hair and I feel like it would be a really fun change for you (Also I know the last place you videoed getting your hair cut said that they could take you to a bleach blonde which would complement your skin tone so well! So if you wanted to do that too.) But I completely understand if you want to keep it long for now because of your wedding, but it's something to think about for the future. Love you so much, it's amazing what you do! (you could also do the thing where during your wedding instead of a dress change you cut your hair.) :)
Your fiancé seems so sweet and you two really compliment each other together! I think he looks a lot like Gregg Sulkin from Wizards of Waverly Place days imo
So happy for you Mia thank you for being here Stewart!!
SHAWN MENDES
You deserve this Mia
sO CUTE SO HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU
SO HAPPY FOR YOU . He's so HANDSOME ❤️. Don't worry I'm sure he's gonna get used to us soon I read the comments and we're all doing a very good job and being nice   😂💃
hes like shawn mendez ish with a disney prince.
I can't wait for you to have a baby! You will love pregnancy 😘
Congradulations, you two are such a cute couple, wishing you many wonderful years together..
Stuart gives me Flynn Ryder vibes
He looks SO MUCH like MatPat from The Game Theorists, but my fiancé says he also resembles Robert Pattinson.
Omg i love!! You guys are so cute 🥰

I think if like Robert Patinson and Tom Hiddleston had a baby Stewart would be their baby 😁💖

First thing I thought of was he looks like MatPat!
FREAKING ADORABLE COUPLE!!!

He is ADORABLE.  kinda has Joe Goldberg vibe for me tho😭😂 But that's because he is shy i think. I wish you happiness and love ❤️
You are like couple match made in heaven! Even looks are so similar!  wish you both  all the best ♥️♥️♥️
He's so sweet Mia I'm so happy for you!! <3 He looks a little bit like RJ Mitte and maybe Hugh Jackman ?
My boyfriend used to valet park for RuPaul ages ago! 🤣 He had no idea how famous he was because back then he was literally just getting started. I was watching the show one day and he was like...I know that guy! I went 4 years dating without knowing they had  significant encounters.

Joey Bragg from liv and Maddie (Disney channel)

Hello Mia and Stuart, You'r so cute together. In Sweden we call it that you have "äktensskapstycke". I don't know if it's accurate, But in Google translate  it's Marriage Liking 😉🥰❤️😍. It means that you look cute together and that you belong together 👍🏻❤️.

Hello stuart
So handsome ah! Looks like my future hubby too 😍 so maybe Im biased
Stuart looks like Joe Goldberg from You! But not the personality :)
Stuart's hair is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
I LOVEEEEE IT 🤍
before the question was even asked.... I just kept thinking OMG--his whole chill vibe and look/facial structure is so similiar to SM
They are so wholesome
You guys are So cutttttteeee 💕💕
omg! this video was so cute and i’m so happy that you, stuart, are allowing us the pleasure of meeting you! you both have such a nice energy and are both so cute and cute together🥺
To me, he looks like Dave Franco.
Aww I am so happy for you

Nah that's Matpat. But forreal though, happy for you guys.
The way he keeps looking at you and can't stop ❤  Your so happy Mia and that's all we want from you😺
I already love him
HENRY CAVILLE
Love you guys!!! Definitely have more content with him! Wishing you all of the love and happiness the world has to offer!
Aww I’m so happy for you two. You look awesome together ☺️
He's so sweet. So happy for Mia.
Celeberity look-a-like : Brandon Routh
he kinda looks like Joshua basset is just me? ok
He kinda looks like orlando bloom
Matthew Patrick
I love this
I don't know, but I kinda feel like ur mean to him. He's adorably bashful and sweet, it seems. I know she's probably just messing with him, but I don't know. I feel like she's overdoing it for the camera. Idk I feel like "being known" changes people. Obviously people change as they get older and become more confident. I'm not trying to be mean. I think YouTube Mia is different from real life Mia. He seems nice. Wish you both all the best.
Y’all are just so freaking adorable 😭❤️
my cheeks hurt from watching this video coz i’m smiling the entire time. i love you mia im so happy for you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
At first sight I thought Stewart looked like Jim from The Office
To get some of the water out of the zucchini, you can soak it in salt over night and it will talk a lot of the water out.
It still blows my mind how he put so much meaning and sentiment in your engagement ring. Such a lovely pair you guys are MashaAllah🤍
Congrats to the newbie! Hope you can relax into the videos quickly!!! And welcome to the madness!!!
He's adorable :)  Can't think of a celebrity look alike but he could be a celebrity himself he's so cute :)  You make an adorable couple.
He looks like David Tennant
you're the cutest couple Ever!!
Weirdly enough he does seem familiar, but I can't get my finger on it... Either way he seems super nice and sweet, you two are adorable together! <3
he pulled out the UK (welsh) drag queen!  WE STAN, MIA
Oh goodness he's so lovely! Properly matched so well together. I personally think he looks like those twins finn and Jack that used to have a YouTube channel like 10 years ago called jacksgap!
THE SWEETEST NO CAP

Aw yay! Hi Stuart! Nice to see you in Mia’s video!!!! 😃

He's adorable and I'm happy for you both! ♥️
I can't explain how excited I was for this!! he seems so sweet and you guys get along so well. can't wait to see him in future videos <3  I also was thinking when you guys were talking about spiderman that you were going to say you like andrew garfield's spiderman because he looks like your fiance 😂 so I'd say andrew garfield for his celebrity look alike, but he also gives off peter parker vibes in general tbh
Omg he's perfect. That's all. Just perfect. I am so happy for you both. 🤍🤍🤍
Aww, I love this! Hi Stewart 👋 You two are so cute and fitting 💕

He looks a bit alike Carlos Sainz, Formula 1 driver
Omg how is no one talking about how he looks like MatPat lol
I just wanna say, from seeing his side profiles in pics and sensored pics, I always thought he looked like Tom Holland and when y’all were talking about Spider-Man I almost peed myself 🤣 you guys are absolutely adorable and I’m so happy for you Mia!! I’ve been your follower for years now 💗 and yes he still looks like Tom holland to me a little!
He looks like a young Steve Buscemi in absolutely the nicest way possible! I loved seeing you guys together it’s easy to see how comparable you are! Much love to you both!
He's so adorable! You guys are made for each other
She said Gemini and I got nervous! 🤣🤣 but the Taurus energy is good! 😆 congratulations you guys!!!!!
The way stuart looks at you is just wholesome. This type of love is rare, protect it.❤❤
Okay as someone who has watched you since way back when in the beginning I definitely approve of Stewart! He is so kind and has so much love for you and you can tell just by the way he looks at you Mia 💜 he reminds me of a mix between Joe (Penn Badgley) from YOU on Netflix and Edward (Robert Pattinson) from twilight if I had to choose celebrities he looks like. So happy for you two! Thanks Stewart for letting the Maples Fam meet you!!
Aaahh me he’s the cutest!! So happy for your engagement!
Veggie lasagna trick. Don't cook your lasagna noodles. They'll soak up all the water that comes out of the veggies so you don't lose any of that flavor.

Stuart reminds me of another YouTubers husband. Her name is FleurDeForce. He reminds me of her husband Mike but more in her early videos and more mannerisms than looks :).  Happy for you both.  Also I apologize if that’s not how he spells his name.

He really looks like a french canadian actor named Sébastien Delorme! (But younger obviously)
YOU GUYS ARE GREAT!!!!
My sister is a cuspy taurus/gemini & I am a taurus. She's my favorite sibling.
He’s cute!!! You two are adorable 🥰

He did great! Thank you for agreeing to be on the channel Stewart! It’s a privilege to meet you. I wish you both so much happiness and love
I see a resemblance with Penn Badgley
I'm really happy that you found each other, and that he loves you enough to be a part of a video for you because it is a part of your life and of who you are. He looks at you like I look at my husband, with complete and absolute love. I wish you both all the happiness that life has to offer... Lots of love from Argentina.
There’s no such things as cusps. He is a Gemini or Taurus depending on the time he was born, so you’d have to look up birth chart to see which one it is.
Thank you Stuart for joining! His look a like to me would be if Robert Pattinson and Timothee chalomet had a child together! :)
His looks remind me of Andrew Garfield
This video was so wholesome and adorable ! You're both very lucky to have found each other in this crazy world ♥️
Absolutely adorb the vibe you two share! SUCH A BEAUTY SYMPHONY OF TRUE LOVE WHICH WAS SO REFLECTIVE THROUGHOUT! 💗🥺 Made me smile the whole time.. I am glad that he felt ready to introduce himself to us❤ I love his energy so calm yet chaotic 💫 Up to par with yours🔥 I was a minute in and I was like YESSS 🤌   To answer your question he reminds me of Young Leonardo Dicaprio (maybe due to hair) , Young Johnny deep and Shawn Mendes in the mix🙈🤭   Definitely excited to see this new part of your life grow it something so beautiful and everlasting 🥰 I wish you both so much more love and happiness..Waiting for more fiance content 💕
I feel like he looks like the actor from You that plays Joe
Don’t be Stingy link the zucchini lasagna recipe!! ☺️
I think Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield as soon as I saw him I thought he kinda looks like him, haha sending you love Mia💕💕
Awww congrats Mia and Stuart 😀
MIA + STEWART = Beautiful Babies 🥰
We are so happy to finally meet him! Can't wait to see more of you guys together, you're so cute ♥
So happy for you Mia. 💜 I'm in total agreement with horoscopes not always being right and Sagittarius' getting along with Pisces. My best friend ever, my husband of 13 years is a Pisces and I'm a Sagittarius 😁 And your man reminded me of Shawn Mendes when I first saw him.
OH MY GOD
He looks a bit like David Tennant the guy who plays Dr who
Cutest people ever!!❤❤🤗🤗

Stewart is gorgeous.He's his own celerbrity.Those eyelashes.

I don’t really know a celebrity that looks like Stewart, but you really look like Kat McNamara when she was filming Shadowhunters a few years ago!!❤️
ok but I'm a gemini and my husbands a pisces lol y'all are precious!!
OH GORL HES CUTE!!!!!
Your zodiac signs probably are compatible if you compare your birth charts instead of just your sun signs! 😊
He looks like he could be a brother to timothee chalamet
He kind of looks like Johnathan Jackson from tuck everlasting!
20:47 i thought stewart looked like the guy from Twilight at first (y’all know who i’m talking about)
Your fiance is so sweet, cant wait to see him more in the future videos 🙏He looks a bit like David Tennant  🤔
I am so happy for the both of you! you both look so happy :)  I can't think of a celebrity that Stuart looks like, but he reminds me of a Youtuber called MatPat who does theories on games and food :)
I wouldn’t say he’s a “celebrity” but he looks like MatPat from Game Theory to me!  Congratulations 🥰 you guys are super cute!
You two are adorable!!!! Mia and Stuart works well! What’s funny is Stuart does resemble Andrew G from spider man 👀
You guys look soooooooooo cuteeeeeeeeee together  #Couple goals 😊
Noo
Miaaa I'm crying and laughing 😅 I love him so much. He definitely looks like a celebrity but resembles different celebs in different ways so zayn malik, a young Milo Ventimiglia, honestly he looks like an actor himself, like he should be doing movies and shows. I'm so happy for you mia you guys are the most precious couple on YouTube I just can't he is perfect ❤ I can't wait for you guys to live your best life and vlog it and ugh the kids are gonna be so cute. My comment is so all over the place but dammit I loved him through and through. Mia, I can't put into words how much love and happiness I'm sending your way. Love you always. And Stuart should audition somewhere for something lol. And omg I think he has a personality so similar to Andrew Garfield I love him too. Love you guys so much. ❤❤
His celebrity doppelgänger is kind of like a more handsome Daryl Sabara!! I also feel like Mia would have been obsessed with spy kids so this tracks.. 😂
Eeeee been waiting for this and y'all are the perfect match for eachother<33🤧😊
You guys are so adorable!!
OMG no matter what the zodiac signs say , you guys are MADE FOR EACHOTHER 😍 PS , I kinda think Stewart looks like shawn mendes
The next Simply Nailogical and Beyn🥰🥰🥰
“I have an extra button undone😏” ha love him 🤣
Awe you guys are so cute! He’s so sweet and shy in front of the camera! You can tell he feels weird looking into it and talking so he looks at you the whole time with so much love 🥺
Omg I'm so happy for you two, seems like a perfect match💖💖 And for the celebrity twin part, I think he reminds me a little bit of Jacob Elordi from the side 🤔 I hope I'm not the only one seeing that hahaha
celeb doppelgänger for sure pierre boulanger
I don’t think he looks like any celebrity specifically but I think he would make a great Spiderman lol
Thanks Stuart for being in the video! It´s not a celebrity but he looks just like my friend´s highschool boyfriend hahaha
Such a good video! And I'm so happy for yous! Yous are amazing togather 😍🌹
He looks like a younger version of Henry Cavill and a bit like Timothy Chalamet  Edit. Also rewatched it and he also reminds me a bit of Eugene Fitzherbert (aka Flynn Rider) and Milo Tatch (from the movie Atlantis: The Lost empire)
1st thought ‘she is dating the Timothée Chalamet!!!,  no … Andrew Garfield no….  If he hates the camera probably not either one ‘
This was such a sweet video!! Nice to meet you Stuart!! 😊 I would say that Stuart looks like a mix between Henry Cavill and Andrew Garfield!!
I hope he didnt feel too pressured. So happy for Mia 💖💖💖
We’re proud of you guys and wish nothing but amazing things for you guys!
As soon as I saw him, I thought of gigi goode out of drag 😂😂😂

Awe!!! He’s adorable!!!
I don't know if he looks like anyone, but I thought he looks familiar 🤔
Usually when someone reveals their boyfriend online, I have to really take it in and it takes a while for me to get used to them because I din’t imagine them together, The second I saw you too together I was like, “Oh ya” “They are meant to be!” <3
mia shooting a shot and it went in smoothly & now she’s won
He's sooooooooooooooo great. We love him!!
Yall so adorble god bless stay safe healthy
I always shoot my shot. It's better than just having to have metaphorical conversations with them in your head.
Loved the reaction from Mama Maples!!  You guys are so cute!!!
weirdly enough in the first thirty seconds before the spidey question, i thought he looked similar to andrew garfield😂
Omg I love you guys!!! Literally if my Ken and Barbie dolls became ppl 😂😂
19:40 not Mia trying to get Stewart's insight on her wedding dress lol
my HEART

Awe, you two are such an adorable couple! I’m so happy we could finally meet him and I can’t wait to see him more often (if he’s okay with that of course)😊 as for the doppelgänger question, he kind of reminds me of the brother from Liv and Maddie, Joey Bragg. But I’m not totally sure🤔
OMGGGGGGGG I WAS WAITING FOR THIIIIS ❤️❤️❤️❤️  I'm so nervous i'm having surgery tomorrow, this is my break
Wow that’s so crazy I have no words you two look so beautiful together!

He looks like Victor from Corpse bride 👰‍♀️

Tobey, Tom, Andrew. But I love them all this new spiderman was so awesome! I loved it.
To me, Stuart looks a lot like MatPat from the Game Theorists.
He looks like a mix of Tom Holland and Timothee Chalamet 😅 🤷🏽  Also, couldn't stop grinning the whole video 🤍
He looks an exact copy of Penn Badgley (Joe Goldberg from YOU)
why does Stuart look like a Peter Parker? 🤣
He looks like matpat. When I first looked at him I thought he looked really familiar, he definitely looks like a lot of celebrities. But it took me the whole video to figure out I was thinking of matpat from game theory
You guys are hilarious, seriously, we can feel your chemistry and that’s amazing! I love you already. ♥️
She’s literally engaged to joe. Joe & love vibes all the way! 😂❤️

I can't wait to watch your videos & this was so cute, seeing your  fiancé. You two are perfect together! I can't wait to see your future videos together!
“I have an extra button undone” HAHAHA i crack so hard, btw the way he looks at Mia is just so sweet, you guys look so good together 🥺🥺 oh my heart 🥺💕
Does anyone else think he looks a lot like Graveyard Loon?
None can be mean to you , you're the sweetest person ever 💛 💗 💓
So happy to finally see him! You guys look adorable 🥰….I was thinking the whole time who he reminds me of and it’s…..my dad when he was younger 😅😅😅 idk how old is he but he looks like my dad when he was 24 😂😂 (tho he probably looks like some celebrities too he’s handsome)
I kept thinking he kind of looks like Matpat. Edit: Maybe a cross between Matpat and the young rich guy from Enola Holmes. Top half of the face is pretty Mat, lower is more Enola Holmes guy I think
I have a question for Stuart! Did you watch Mia's videos before you got together?  P.s you look good together ❤
Welcome Stewart or Stuart 🥳💖 you both are so cute and seem so good for each other
He looks like Penn Badgley for sure 😃 (I mean this the nicest way possible btw)
Screaming!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
He kinda reminds me of Gregg Sulkin 🤔 You guys are so cute together, God's bless 🥰
‘Like Stuart little’ ‘thats me’ 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭
I don't know if I'm crazy, but I instantly thought of Gregg Sulkin from that Disney Movie Avalon High when you asked who your fiance's doppelganger was. Also, thank you to him for being such a good sport! Very happy that he is comfortable being featured in videos now since it's such a big part of your life! 😊
Though I believe he hasn't show his full true colors yet I love the bits of his personality that you can already see :D
I think Stuart Looks like Gregg Sulkin! He's from Wizards of Waverly Place of all things 🤷‍♀️😊
You guys are so adorable 🐻
straight away i love him!! he stares at you the whole time it’s so sweet, he’s so brave doing this video and we all really appreciate him so much!❤️
You guys are so sweet together 💖🥺
Mia you two are so cute together. When you looks a each other the love that you two have is priceless.
I think straight on he kinda looks like Robert Pattinson. But when he has short hair.
stewart has INCREDIBLE hair
Stewart looks like steven r mcqueen, but actually go watch a scene, cus they share some mannerisms
Really the way he is only watching Mai not camera like he is really watching mai whole video 👀 that’s so cute 🥰
Peanut and Stubby forever 💖💖
Nooooooooo way! Wasn’t even expecting this
It’s so funny you asked about celebrity look a likes because the whole video I was thinking how much he reminds me of a young Hugh Jackman and Joe from “You”!!
He is so Handsome! and sooo sweet!
Ain’t never click so fast
Omg he is given me such a Edward Cullen vibes 😍 and loooove the video
He is so gentle and calm
They are a perfect Pixar couple.
You look cute together!
this was so sweet!!!!
He looks old like the dude from wizards of waverly place not the brothers Alex’s bf I forgot his name
I think he almost looks like a cross between Andrew Garfield and Robert Pattinson
YAY MIA IM SO HAPPY YOU GUYS ARE SOOOOO CUTE IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH
He resembles Finn Wolfhard to me 🥴
y’all match each other so well
You can definitely tell Mia is Stuart's safe haven. Truly the sweetest thing. We know he's been so nervous to be on the channel but the fact he's just constantly looking at Mia with such love and adoration. So excited to finally meet him💞
Just me or does he kind of look like a mixture of newt from fantastic beasts and where to find them and Edward Cullen…..
Mia: Who is more annoying?  Steward: Me or you?   Mia: Spider Man!
he kinda reminds me of the guy who plays joey on liv and maddie if the actor had an older brother
Omg you two vibe so well together! Like he's got your level of chaotic but it seems like he also grounds you somewhat! So happy for you both 💕
Hes like the very good looking lovechild of matpat and Andrew Garfield
Mia is so cheeky with him. Cuties
You guys are so cute!!! I see James Marsden a little and Mia is like Cate Hudson
You compliment each other perfectly. He has such a calming presence too which is perfect alongside you Mia. Wishing you all the happiness in the world xx
What a sweet man! 💕He adores you!💞So sweet!💞Can't wait to see more!💕
TOBY FOREVER...!
Omg the first second i saw him i felt like he kinda looks alike with Shawn Mendes but i thought it might be rude to say it, like comparing him etc BUT u asked it so im saying it haha
Mia!! He seems great and you guys seem sooo compatible!! So cute and so happy for you guys!!!❤️❤️❤️
I'm a Gemini and I'm offended lol
This was the cutest video, I couldn’t stop smiling the entire time. The way he looks at you just melts my heart. Congrats again!!
I don't know if he counts as a celebrity, but he kind of looks like MatPat from Game Theory 🤔
🥺😭❤️🥰
Oh wow- you guys are so sweet together. The way he looks at you 🥺🥺🥺
Adorable couple!
It’s very possible that he’s a Taurus. Traditional astrology says I’m a Pisces born on March 20 but I’ve had my birth chart read by many people, and they all say I’m actually an Aries. I would trust your instincts Mia!
he reminds me of Gregg Sulkin!
About the celebrity lookalike question, your fiance gives me Pierre Niney vibes (a french actor). He gives frenchie vibes in general actually I think
I'm a Gemini too and I'm tired of us having a bad rep! My boyfriend is a Pisces and my best friend is a Sagittarius so I agree with zodiac signs being inaccurate.
This man IS in L O V E with Mia, you just can tell this from looking at him! Omg it's soo refreshing to see and soo beautiful. 🥰💯
I'm one minute in and already crying
Aww he's awesome, Mia!! Excited to see more of him :))
You can see  love in eyes the way he looks at you.
I think his celebrity lookalike is Troye Sivan
He seems like a very caring man :) I'm sure You will have an amazing life together, I wish You all the best!
He’s so sweet, welcome Stuart!  He looks like Timothee Chalamet’s older brother.
I straight up thought he looked like MatPat for a split second which absolutely would have made no sense considering that MatPat is married with a child
My immediate thought is he looks like MatPat!
He kinda looks like Noah Schnapp haha
OH for celebrity look alikes hear me out- Sam Claflin + David Tenant + Robert Pattinson
He looks like  Tom cruise (side profile wise) with a hint of Timothée chalamet's  bone structure , and also you guys are cute together he seems like such a nice guy.
Y'all are so cute and he seems like a sweetheart! My husband said he looks like MatPat
Welcome to the gang Stuart!!! We've been waiting 3 years for you! Just Breathe and remember that the love is here.. You have to ignore peer pressure and hate. Love you guys 💕
Like you guys are made for each other and also guys are perfect match 👌 😍 ❤ iam crying xoxo
Welcome! So glad you are here! Thanks for opening up and coming on Mia's channel!!!
Joe goldberg
I litterally smiled from the start to the ending!!! you're such a nice couple! 🥰
Perfect couple ! ♥️✨🥺 Mia you are so cute together! ♥️
As soon as i saw Stuart, I instantly saw Penn Badgley and now i can't unsee it hahah
So awesome to meet you!!!! ☺☺
Omg Mia he’s so cute  HE LOOKS LIKE EDWARD CULLEN (1st movie) Am I the only one seeing this
I loved meeting him! He did great! As for look alike, it’s not exact but I see some Robert Pattinson.
He's very cute Mia, well done..... But also........... He's just like your Dad........
For some reason I thought she was still together with the guy that got her the Gucci belt for Xmas years ago lmao ?? I missed alOT clearly
Mia you said he’s a Gemini I can’t trust that man no more 😭 so sorry
What’s the name of the song at 9:41?
I feel like we had already seen him. He just fits with Mia perfectly!!! So happy for you both ❤️
You two are so cute 🥰
Hello! he's so kind!!!!!
Looooved this video!!!! Hello Stuart 🤍
When the Spidey question was asked I kinda thought he resembled Andrew Garfield a little bit
😍😍😍
aw you guys are so perfect for each other!!
Stuart reminds me of Matthew Gray Gubler!
happy for you both! ❤️
Yay yay yay yay! Thanks stewart for showing your face!!! We appreciate it!
He's so soft spoken 😭😭 you totally balance each other. You guys are adorable 😍😍😍
ahhh you are so good together , i am so happy for both of you
HES SO SWEET. Love you Mia! So happy for you two
My sister immediately said he looks like Greg Sulkin 👀👀. Such a fun video❤️❤️❤️
First of all: adorable 😍 second of all, he reminds me of Jack Harries, throwing it back to the early YouTube days ✌🏻
He’s so adorable! You guy’s are so great together and I can definitely tell you guy’s are in love!  To me, he kind of looks like Shawn Mendes! 😂
He seems really sweet, you two make a Biutiful couple.  And he reminds me of Penn Badgley​ from "You"
He looks like David Tennant
That was great he’s adorable! I love that he looks at you for comfort because he’s probably a bit nervous. He kind of looks likes combination of Gregg Sulkin and Robert Pattinson.
OMFG, YOU TWO ARE JUST SO ADORABLE. Mia your fiancé is just so precious, he was so shy to look at the camera that he just stared at you the entire time. You'll probably have to post a ton of pictures of him front facing coz we just got to see his left side 😂😂😂😂 anyways, you guys are really great. And I really loved his answer to the zodiac compatibility question. Like it doesn't matter what zodiac you are, it's the people who are compatible and not zodiacs and the way he said that you are 100% compatible just made me feel so proud. Oh god this comment is getting long and you probably won't even read it. But yeah, don't worry Mia. It's your energy and your genuineness which attracts really good people around you, and I'm sure noone around you will be mean to you or Stuart or anyone for that matter. Thank you for bringing out the good in ppl Mia. You are doing great.
he was probably too nervous so he kept looking at mia but omgggg thank you so much for doing this!! we love you both
For me he is a mixture between Robert Pattinson and Timothée Chalamet but better😇 You both are so cute together💙
he kinde looks like endrew garfield
You two are so cute! Stewart is great and to answer your last question, I immediately thought after seeing him that he reminds me of the youtuber matpat (from game theory and his other channels), don’t know if you’re familiar with him ☺️
He looks like Evan Peters or Ross Lynch.
I feel like Mia asked the question at the end, because she says he looks like someone and he never agrees 😂😂😂
He reminds me of the main guy from YOU . Anyone agree ??
You both look so cute and it's so easy to see how in love you guys are! He looks so nice and I'm so happy that we could finally get to know him!
to answer your question! he looks like the guy who plays joe in the tv show you! like they have a resemblance! i loved this mia and am so excited for you!
You are my altamite fovourate you tuber  I am sooo happy your happy 😊
They way I screamed when I saw this in my sub box!! Cant wait to watch!!!
Been anticipating this video 🥺🤍 Honestly WE LOVEEE HIMMM!!!✨🤍
I think he looks like Norman from Bates hotel. I like Stewart he seems like a really nice compassionate person you both make a cute happy couple ❤️❤️❤️❤️
He looks similar to Gregg sulkin for sure!
I fully thought he was Shawn mendes the first 20 seconds of the video lmao. so happy for you Mia <33
OH MY GOODNESS, THIS IS AMAZING, YOU TWO ARE THE CUTEST!! We love him already! 😍❤️
the nicknames!!!! 😂😭💜 you two are so cute together, congratulations! Also he kinda reminds me of Finn Wolfhard, there is someone else in mind but I can't think of the name 😅
Aw so happy for you Mia 🥰🥰🥰
You two are so cute 🥰
I LOVE that he and your mom have a great relationship. Wish you guys all the happiness in the world!
Tobey Maquire!!!
He reminds me of Timothee chalamet I think that's how it's spelled lol
Celebrity lookalike: he kinda gives me David Tennant vibes!! 😂
You picked a good one! Love you two together. So happy for both of you. Look forward to seeing more of Stuart. Great name too. That’s my brothers name. 💕
The way he looks at you says it all. I'm so happy for you two ❤❤❤
He reminds me of Joe from You
He was soo cute when he said " what risks, I have a extra button undone" he is so cute... 😊😊
Yay you both are amazing have the best life together!
I LOVE you guys! You are perfect for each other!!!!!
Mia you kinda look like 'Pewdiepie'😂 And Stuart kinda look British 🤭
I honestly thought of Andrew Garfield the moment I saw his face.. lol
Stewart looks like Shawn mendes… like kinda lol
Both of u is soo cute.. Happy for u
OMG sooooo cuteee :)
9:22 gemini behavior
You are so cute together. And both have amazing hair
I think Stuart could look alot like Mateo Bocceli! I would like to know about his family, siblings and parents. 😁So good to meet you Stuart! Also p. s. What does he do for a living?
You gays are so cute I wish you the best 💚👍
He has such great hair!!! 😊 so nice how he looked for your reassurance the whole video. So cute!
He looks a little bit like Matt Patt from film theory but I guess he isn't exactly a celebrity
I think Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland had a baby so you both loving Spider-Man is appropriate!
my birthday is may 21 he has to have the same birthday
Cusps are not real they are a myth and just simply aren’t a thing but he has a whole chart that dictates his personality not just one lol.    I know people some don’t care but that doesn’t mean other people can’t. (I only said that cuz everything I’ve posted about astrology I get “it’s so stupid to think zodiacs are real) comments.
He is sooo cute!!!!!! Congrats Mia! So cool bc you & I got engaged same age. Everyone said I was too young. But here we are. Still married. After all this time 🖤🖤🖤
Y’all are so sweet, I’m so happy for you
I’m so glad we got to meet your fiancé! He seems amazing! Also, funny thing about the Spider-Man question, he looks like the perfect mix of all three of the actors mixed together. You’re engaged to the ultimate Spider-Man!
He is so in love with you.
Yuji Itadoriii
GREG SULKIN! stuart looks like warewolf boy himself. at first glance i was like wait he looks like someone…..by the end of it i realized i see so much of greg sulkin in him!! wow
His personality reminds me SO much of papa maples… and I Love that.
He’s exactly what I pictured lol good job Mia lol he’s handsome
He is quite the catch. When I first saw him though I thought that he looked a lot like fellow YouTuber Graveyard Loon.
Hi Steward! It was a fun video. You two seem so fun together! 😊
He looks like MatPat!
You guys looks sooooo cuuuute together!!!😍❤️❤️❤️ he seems so kind and fun! I’m really looking forward to get to know him as good at we know you🥰 I’m so happy for you!

Stuart you did A-MAY-ZING!! So happy that we’re able to put a face and name to Mia’s FIANCÉ 😜 Excited to see you in more videos to come 💕
7:30 the zodiac signs in couples are about moon sing tho. Mia is reading sun sign 👀 very different because sun sign is about friendship and how people is at work through the day, but in a home and personal relationship we are our moon sign
omg so happy for u!
He reminds me of edward cullin a bit! Thank you mia for sharing such a private part of your life with us! I wish you all the happiness in the world.
Girl you guys are so cute together!!!💕
You two have so much chemistry and the way he looks at you shows how much he loves you! One of the cutest couples i have ever seen, i wish i could find someone that treasures me that much too. Congratulations on your engagement!
Penn Bagdley!!

Perfect match 🥰 i think he looks similar to Andrew Garfield
Omg! He is adorable! You are so cute together!
I'm so happy for you!! You look so cute together❤ To answer the question: I think he looks Joey Bragg. Someone else said you guys give off like Juliet and Mason vibes from Wizards of Waverly Place and I totally agree😄😊 When looking at the comments a lot of people mentioned people from Disney so maybe he really gives Disney vibes.  I'm so glad we got to meet him!! Thank you Stewart for agreeing to be apart of a video!! I'm excited to see more videos of you two together💕😊
Aww, what a good sport ❤️ He looks and sounds like Drew Gooden. So, adorable.
THE TWO DOOR CINEMA CLUB I HEARD IT
To me, he Maybe looks a bit like Matthew Broderick from his ‘Ferris Bueler’ -days???😄 but he doesn’t have to look like a ‘celeb’ just like your future husband🤣😂👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽😉🙋🏽‍♀️
LOVE YOU MIA!! You guys are so cute together omfg 💜Stewart’s side profile reminds me of Wyatt Oleff’s from IT bahaha
Soooo cute!
As soon as he popped up on the screen and y'all started interacting, I knew it was so perfect
Stewart kind of gives me Andrew Garfield vibes.
Now we need a video with Chip and Stewart (or Stuart? Sorry if I got it wrong 😅)
He looks like a real life prince!
You should bake with him
Okay maybe this is weird but he looks like the young version of drake bell, and the young version of my dad mixed together.   Also his hair is immaculate and I LOVE seeing you two so happy together. I’m so glad we finally got to meet him!
lol he's clearly in love with you!!
He totally looks like Elijah Wood. But less awkward.
He looks like Andrew Garfield!
I think he looks like Gregg Sulkin! Tell him thank you for doing this video! We support y'all 🖤🖤🖤
You two should bake a wedding cake together!
He looks like matpat
Hiii from the UK 😊 Minor celeb but there is an actor who plays Mackenzie in the show called Emmerdale... Honestly they look very similar!!!
He reminds me so much of Joe Goldberg lol minus the murder obvi 😹
you guys compliment each other so nicely. i’m sure he isn’t as shy in person but i truly love how he is so quiet and timid and you’re the complete opposite. he truly loves you so much as we all can see by the way he looks at you. i am so happy for you mia. 💗🥺
He does look like a lot of celebrities but I can’t think of their names
He looks like Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) from ‘You’ Netflix series
Awwww🤍
Am I the only one who thinks he looks like MatPat? 🤔
I feel so happy for you both 😍 I think that he looks a lot like Gregg Sulkin!
Timothy Chalamet why are you with Mia ????
Love this video. Thank you for being on camera and answering questions with Mia, Stuart. Love seeing how you guys look at each other. ❤️❤️❤️
D'aw!  How sweet you two are together, thanks so much for sharing this Q&A.  You two are adorable together, congrats on your engagement and best wishes.
omg he is so in loveeeee! you are so cute together! sweetness overload! :)
Stuart looks like Louis Tomlinson to me
You are both so cute! Great job on his first video, he looks so nervous but he did great!
Nice to see you! You're such a lovely couple 😍
I smiled the whole time!! You guys are so cute. Thank you for joking Mia for a video!
I just keep thinking about fleurdeforce husband Mike when he was younger when I see your man!  He is good looking Mia!
Why is no one saying Penn Badgley??? To me he looks sooo much like him

When I woke up I was like “hmmmmm what’s today” then I realized “TODAY IS SUNDAY TODAY IS SUNDAY TODAY IS SUNDAAAAAAYYYYY!!!!!!”
He is gorgeous *_*
He looks like Greg sulkin!!!!
Clicked on this video so fast like not even joking 😹 i see resemblances of some actors but i don't know their names so just go with yess 😹🥰❤ love this so much and so excited for future video's 💕
ROBERT PATTINSON
he reminds me of mason from wizards of waverly place!
He's exactly 💯 the man i imagined it in my mind wtf btw nice choice tho
Omg is his birthday May 21, that is my birthday! lol
Omg!! He seems like such a genuinely sweet person! Thank you Stuart for being in this video and for taking care of Mia like how she deserves! ❤❤❤
i think you guys should do a baking contest and have mama maples do a blind taste test to pick a winner
He kinda looks like Gregg sulkin like they could be brothers for sure 🤭
Nice to meet and get to know your groom...you seem to have a good vibe together. Have you ever done your numerology? Glynis McCants is a good numerologist to learn from...it's interesting to play with the concept
I think he looks like MAT PAT like a lot and TOM HOLLAND
Excuse me? He’s so cute and so clearly head over heels for you, Mia! Congrats on finding each other 😊
He´s sooo cute Mia!! <3 I can´t help my self but he looks like Joe aka Penn Badgley from You serial and  a little bit like Jacob Elordi. :D <3
Why he looks like a baby
Y'all guys are adorable 🥰
I smiled throughout this entire video. Thank you Stuart for doing this video, and of course for making Mia so happy and loved!🥰❤️
Jezz Stuart is a hottie lol they fit so perfectly together. I love the way he looks at her
Aww you guys are so cute! 💕
Loved this video and getting to meet the fiancé!
You guys are so sweet! Stewart is such a cutie! Props to him for being in a video, so thank you! I feel like we are finally meeting our favorite celebrity. THANK YOU SO MUCH STEWART! We love you so much!
You aré adorable together!
He actually looks like MatPat, right?? Does anyone else think so?
This looks like you guys broke up. Can you maybe just use an em😍ji for his face?
So happy for the both of you 🥰
Awe I loved this!! Looks like you found a good one Mia!
Love his name. He matches you. He’s very good looking. Your children will be gorgeous people.
He looks like Timothy chalamet… such a cute video…lots of love and wishes to you both…
A little resemblance to Harry Conic JR
He saying “ don’t be mean” me all of the sudden getting the urge to say something😂😂😂. So happy
You guys are literally made for each other. He sems really kind. I'm so happy for you.💛 Greetings from Switzerland 💕💕
Can YouTube create a love button just for this video?! Because I can’t like it enough! I’m so happy you found your perfect match 🥺
nice to meet you sir!
He looks so much like MatPat oh my goodness
Loved this video! Y’all are so cute together!
No lie. He kinda looks like Toby maguire
Stewart seems so nice! So glad we finally got to meet him. Funny enough he’s exactly what I was expecting. Also, as a Gemini who is very much a Gemini I can say Stewart defo doesn’t give me the vibe of one. I get Taurus more too honestly lmao.
as soon as i saw stewart i was reminded of greg sulkin! especially circa his wizards of waverly place era LOL
I wish you would take more fashion risks, I wish you would dive into more browns… 😂 legit almost pee’d myself.
I am so happyyyyy for you Mia he's awesome
HE REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF FREDDIE HIGHMORE!!!! 🥺😍
It’s so cute you guys are matching 🥺
He’s so handsome 🤗
Omg he's cute!!! He can stay
So happy for you both!! ❤️
This video is so good I’m dying watching this during my work break and don’t want to go back so I can finish watching the video so funny I love it he so sweet you guys are so cute together !!!
YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO YOUR FULL BIRTH CHARTS!!!! Your “pisces” and “gemini” are your Sun signs and that isnt the only determining factor for relationships, you should definitely look into your mercury and venus signs and see if they make things make more sense lol
He kinda looks like joe from you…. but cute
I wish we could’ve gotten more questions about himself.. or Mia answered questions he answered about her for him? Honestly all I learned about him in this video was his name and that he gets along with her mom and chip.. they’re cute but I wish we had better questions.
I really loved the way he's looking at you Mia 🥺 you're so cute together 🥰 wish you the best✨
You both are so good together!! I think Stuart looks like a better looking Andrew Garfield. Congratulations to both of you!!!
He kinda looks like Jacob Elordi or Steven R. McQueen :) But girl he is so handsome
He looks like Joey Bragg
Y’all are so adorable and I’m so happy for you! 🥺🥺 And is it just me or does his profile kind of look like Bradley Will Simpson from the Vamps?!
For astrology: You're more than your Sun sign! You have to look at your moon, rising, venus, mars! There's so much that can go into it <3
Beautiful couple. All the best wishes 😍
you guys are so cute !❤️
I was watching something else and I saw this and instantly left that other video.
Before they even started talking about Spider-Man I thought he kinda looked like Tom Holland!!!
Omg! Finally was waiting badly...loved it 😍💕😘
He did great! I'm so happy for you guys ❤️
He oddly looks like Shawn Mendes
I grinned all the way throughout this entire video; you two made me soooo happy. Also, I love Geminis and I’m also a Taurus
I think he looks like Andrew Garfield lol but honestly!
Y’all are so great together and I understand his nervousness. Thank you for letting us get to know you! Exciting to future for y’all! ❤️
Aww you guys are so cute together so happy for you both!💗

“I have an extra button undone”
U guys looks soo cute together ❤️  Love from India 🇮🇳
In the most respectful way queen mia you have bagged a grade A hottie, congratulations. Also he seems so lovely. He deffo reminds me of a celebrity but I can’t place it for the LIFE of me, maybe like a more chill boi Henry Cavill???
So happy for you guys! And he TOTALLY looks like Shawn Mendes!!! ❤
U asked what celebrity he looks like but he reminds me of “mat pat” from YouTube. Beautiful couple wish y’all all the best ❤️❤️
When I saw him I thought of Doctor Who. Like immediately that’s where my mind went.

Ahhhhh Mia Little should be your new channel name… 😌

They’re literally a princess and prince duo love them tgt smmmm 😭💞

If a man respects his woman's mother he is a keeper.....when Mia told us how he had the other diamond put in a necklace for her mom it brought a tear to my eye!  The two of you make a cute couple!
He reminds me of Gregg Sulkin hihi. Excited to see more of him in your channel Mia :)
He looks like the guys from YOU a little bit 😂 even the voice it’s similar I think

Amazing! 👏 He did fantastic job. You're so one for another and clearly in love. Keep going together through life ❤❤🥰🥰
He looks a little bit like Robert Pattinson right?
I could watch this ALL DAY. You guys are SO CUTE and hilarious.  Also, for the doppelganger question, if all three Spidermen had a baby, it would be Stewart.
I’m genuinely happy for you! You guys look so cuteee
penn bagley. he kinda looks like him.
Mia! What a catch! So happy for you guys.
He could play a Spider-Man. That’s his doppelgänger
He looks like Tom Welling
Hes looks similar to Robert Pattinson from twilight
The adoring looks he gives Mia is so cute. Such a cute couple
You two are so precious with each other!! Love it!! 🥰 if I had to imagine your better half this is exactly what I would've pictured 😅💞
i love this your videos allways cheer me up
He seems great, i am so happy for you too ❤
Right away when I saw Stuart, I thought he reminded me very much of Jacob Elordi :)
Mia you asked for his celebrity lookalike but why does he keep reminding me of Ratatouille lmao (w love and respect)
Definitely looks like Joe Goldberg😱
Omg y'all are literally perfect for each other!! Nice to meet you😍
not to sound weird but your fiancé looks exactly how I pictured him to be by your general style/vibe/personality lmao, you guys look perfect together, bring the tissues
Mia you almost broke that poor mans brain with those wedding dress material questions 😂
Rising signs and moon signs are more useful in evaluating  relationships.
Definitely a Bob Saget doppelganger
Welcome to the Maples family Stuart! You two are one of the most adorable couples ever! As for who he looks like, I know he's not a celeb in the same way as like a movie star is but Stuart looks like MatPat, weird ik.
I think he kinda looks like Dave Franco, so excited to see future videos with him. Love how you look at him ❤️
I think he really looks like Greyson Chance
I just love the way you guys are together! It’s so sweet to see how much love and care there is between you too! Thank you so much Mia and Stewart for giving us the entertainment and enjoyment we’ve all been wanting! I can’t wait to see more from y’all! ❤️ btw I’ve been on a binge of watching Slogoman lately and that is who I am seeing Stewart looking like! Maybe not a whole lot but somewhat!
Bruh he looks exacly how I imagined him to look.
Oh my gosh. You two are so adorable!!! I'm so happy for the both of you!!!!!
I love the part where mom reacts to him lmaoo
Stuart reminds me of David Tennant from Dr. Who
Aww you guys are absolutely adorable together, it shows how happy you make each other <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It's nice to meet you (finally) Stuart (sp?). I wish you both the very best now & always  💜😊
My mum's pisces and I'm Sagittarius, we are very compatible
So nice to meet him! Btw I think he looks a little like Jacob Elordi (his smile/ nose)
Thats Joe Goldberg
I just feel like He looks like Andrew Garfield.. anyone else?
You guys are so cute 💕💕
Such a cute couple <3 The only celebrity that looks like him (that i can imagine right now) is the guy from ,,You" :D
Penn Badgley? WOAHH
Hi Mia my zodiac sign is a Taurus and I've always said I didn't like Gemini sign people. But every time I meet a person and end up really vibing with them I find out later they're a Gemini. So maybe I do like Geminis... I just tell myself I don't for some weird reason. A person zodiac sign doesn't really mean anything
Mia is such a wonderful human and so protective of her man, I want her to be my fiance!!
Lmaoo cause to me he is such a Gemini (ofc not saying that means anything about your compatibility or any other thing )
He looks like a younger Danny tanner from full house.   I’m happy you are happy :) I can’t wait to see the wedding
I wasn’t really pressed to see your fiancé was glad either way that Mia’s happy and he is too and it’s a big leap to show your face on a platform that has a lot of subscribers but that’s cool he’s stepping out of his comfort zone!
they look so cute together <3 as for the celeb thing i can see like ben barnes maybe :)
Don't worry Mia! I (and I'm sure many of your other fans) will battle to the death anyone who dares give your fiancé any hate.
He looks like Andrew Garfield
When you asked about resemblance to any actor, the first one that came to mind was Mike Myers as Austin Powers. I don't know many celebrities, so maybe that's why only this one I had on my mind. I hope I didn't offend anyone with this.
I think he looks a little like Michael from Princess Diaries at least he kind of has the same mannerisms. He totally has like that early 2000’s movie star that all the girls had crushes on vibe. Haha You did good Mia!! He’s very sweet and y’all seem made for each other!! So happy for you!! 😊
you 2 look so cute together. excited to see him in the future vlogs. best wishes to both of you.
He’s so handsome and reminds me of Penn Badgley from the series YOU
Hi Stewart! Welcome to the maples family!!
He did a great job and I can see the love u have for each other. Hope to see him more in your videos! Lots of love for u guys!
Ay Dioooooossss que lindos! Ay si .. cásense y tengan muchos hijos ! 😍😍😍
He has calming energy like your dad
You two seem so perfect for each other! Stuart, thanks so much for finally being in a video unblurred! You both are so cute and such a beautiful couple. I think Stuart looks like a young Jon Hamm, from Mad Men, and so many other roles. You did good Mia!!
Awww you two are so cute together! Thanks for agreeing to be in a video uncensored, Stewart. Hopefully you’ll feel more relaxed as time goes on. I promise we don’t bite 😉😂 I can see that you make Mia very happy and that’s all that matters to me 🥰 Cherish each other! ❤️ Looking forward to seeing you on the channel more.
The way he doesnt look in the camera but instead looks in her eyes.
He likes Spiderman. I like him! 👍
Happy for y’all🤍🧚🏼‍♀️
He looks like Andrew Garfield from Spiderman 🙂
Something about Stuart reminds me of Freddie Highmore.
Toby McGuire he looks like Toby McGuire

I think he looks like Tyson Ritter!
Hello Stewart!

The fact that he gets along with Mama Maples ACTUALLY made me cry ♥️
He doesn’t look like anyone off the top of my head but he does sound like someone I just can’t put my finger on it! Love this vid and you both are adorable together! ♥️
Love how Mia is with him love your energy even more when ur together! Such a sweet guy!
He low-key looks like Robert Pattinson (as Edward Cullen) lol. But better
Yes! He’s similar to Shawn Mendes, I thought it before you even asked the question.   Also he’s awesome. Welcome Stewart!!
So happy for you two 🤗,such a lovely couple 😍Stuart looks like Brandon Routh from Superman Returns 😀
“We always have to cater to your body thats falling apart” 😂😂
My first thought was that he looked like MatPat from the Game Theorists YouTube channel. Lol  So fun to get to meet him. I thought we would meet him after the wedding!  It will be fun to see him guest appear in random videos. I was wondering what he thought about the rainbow office and if he was helping with some of the room colors?
he kinda looks like Louis partridge
Awww you guy's are soo cute together The way both of you looking in each other eyes is just soo overwhelming  You guys should wear any evil eye jewelery  ( if you dont know wat us evil eye it is believed that the evil eye brings good luck and protects you from any ill-will that could otherwise have a negative effect on your well-being or your life in general.)
*"Palms sweaty, knees weak, mom's spaghetti"* He's got Shawn Mendes' or Tom Hollands hair
Ahhhh oh my god, I’m a Pisces and my boyfriend is a Gemini!! Every compatibility thing says it is a horrible combo but it works!!
You guys are so cute together!💖 Also, he kinda reminds me of Matt Murdock🤔 idk if that's accurate but I kinda see it lol
He’s handsome and seems very sweet!!!  Y’all look great together ❤️
He is awesome! Please include him in more videos like my fiancé chooses my outfits for a week or something like that. So happy for you two ❤
I pictured you with someone like Stuart. He seems to be the perfect man for you. Your babies will be beautiful
You two look so cute together - I'm not surprised his hands were sweating though bless him. I'd like to see him starring in a video with you and your mom!!

He looks like Robert Pattinson when he was in Harry Potter and like Andrew Garfield when he was in Spider Man. ANYWAYS MIA U DID WELL 😏🤍
I love him already. I love that you pushed him a little wo making his super uncomfortable.

If Penn Badgley and Andrew Garfield had a baby.  Xoxo ;)
From a Pisces that has been dating a Gemini for over 10 years - Its a match!! So nice to finally meet your Fiancé, you are both so adorable!! <3
Thanks for trusting us with this Mia. I love his accent. I love you two together. ❤️ Don't dive into browns.
Omg he did so good! You could tell how nervous he was but he's so lovely and funny! Can't wait to see him come out of his shell😊 also legit crying with excitement because my question was the last one! Almost had a heart attack when Mia said my insta handle😱 I've officially made it😅
How long have they been together?
It's so sweet that he chose to be on a video even though it makes him uncomfortable. Also he's such a good looking guy and you are so cute together
here's a question. Why the fuck do all youtubers think they HAVE to include their significant others in videos?? If they don't want to be in it don't CONVINCE them. Leave them be!!!!
i swear i imagined him exactly the way he is and i think you guys are sooooooooo cute together like i can't breathe
You guys are a match made in heaven! So happy for you
So adorable! Wish you both all the best 🥰❤
Check his moon sign. My sun sign is Aquarius my moon sign is a Pisces. I'm definitely more Pisces.
He’s perfect for you
He is perfection for you! <3 Weirdly, he reminds me a little too much of one of my ex's hahaah BUT it's a fantastic ex that I still am friends with and have tons of love for, so it's a good thing! hahah
I dont know why but I thought he was going to look like tom holland his vibes r very tom like though
I loved getting to know Stewart!! I hope he knows how grateful and happy we are to meet him ☺️ i love the energy you guys give off when together so happy for you Mia!   to your question of doppelgängers I honestly think he looks a little like Joaquin phoenix (he played Johnny cash in walk the line)  I also agree he kinda looks like a young Johnny depp
He kinda looks like MatPat
Okay he OBVIOUSLY looks like Joe from “You”
We Stan Stewart ✨❤️
As long as Mama Maples approves, so do I <3

Coming from a Taurus…I can confirm he is a Taurus

He kinda looks like Kai from Vampire Diaries 🤷‍♀️ or MatPat from YouTube
Literally have an ear to ear grin on my face! So excited for both of you and I can’t wait to follow along your guys journey together!
You guys look so cute! For the celebrity lookalike, he reminds me a bit of the guy from The Kissing Booth (Jacob Elordi), but skinnier/with more delicate traits.
So happy he finally made an appearance!! You guys are so adorable❤️
You are a perfect match and I have to say that it's crazy how your story is so similar with mine and my husband ❤ (the zodiac is the same and the way we met, and we've been on a first date when I  was 19...and 12 years later we still love each other like crazy 🥰)
Stewart or Stuart? This is important
He kinda looks like Flynn Rider from tangled! Lol it would be super cute if you guys dressed up as him and Rapunzel :)
He’s exactly what I was hoping he’d be! He’s perfect!
You both are so cute :') he's a great guy and I'm so happy you found each other 😭
He resembles to matpat a little (i hope I am pronouncing his name right).♥️♥️
You two look great together! Stuart is adorable
Congrats Mia I’m so glad you’ve found love and such a kind handsome young man you deserve the world and I’m glad you found each other. And welcome Stewart/Stuart I’m glad you’re there for Mia you seem like an amazing person and you make Mia so happy

This is so cute!!! 💖I was so excited to see this and it was amazing! You guys seem so comfortable and happy with each other☺️ I can’t wait to see how your love for one another continues to grow!! The minute I saw him, I thought he looked like a mix between Robert Pattinson and Penn Badgley lol like Robert on top, Penn on the bottom 🤣
Love that you guys have the same skin tone ❤️
So happy for you! Love you two together, you're the softest soul and he complements you ❤

Okay I don’t know if this is just me but I get Timothee Chalamet x Penn Badgley vibes from him  (Also you guys are adorable!!)
he seems nice and gentle ❤️  Congrats Mia! 🥰
He looks like Shawn Mendes x Penn Badgeley 😋 So happy for you Mia! 🤍
Me and my husband are Pisces and Gemini! I’m the Gemini and he is Pisces/Aries cusp but I swear he is an Aries.
He totally fits perfectly into your family. So sweet!
Oh my good lord, when he says her back issues irritates him cz she is in pain, wwwoooowwwwww i couldn't stop from commenting How cute is he 😘😘
I think he looks like Penn Badgley.. you guys are awesome!
Never clicked on anything this fast
welcome to the family, stewart!!! it’s amazing to meet you!💗
You guys are such an adorable couple! I love that he so supportive of what you do!❤️
He kind of reminds me of a young Eric Bana! Also you guys are adorable! Lots of love! ✨💗
Such a sweet couple.
Awwh, you two are adorable I have high hopes to see you two grow old and have a happy life  ✨✨
Awww thank you Stewart for your time and consideration towards Mia’s fan base. You seem like a kind and gentle soul and I am not surprised based on my YouTube experience with how kind and sweet Mia is. Again thank you and I hope you will pop in once in a while so we can all make sure that you’re doing good too. 💕🧑🏻‍🦳
Awwwww this is so adorable I’m so happy for you Mia and I love that he was willing to come out of his shell to film this video with you. I can see the chemistry as clear as day and I’m loving it! This is amazing I can’t wait to see future videos with you guys together and just him getting used to the camera. I also think he looks like the guy from the  spider-Man movies 1,2,and 3. Which is funny because you guys were talking about it but anyways love the vibes in this video and can’t wait for more! Love you lots Mia 💗
Mia: Does he look like a celebrity? No one: ... Absolutely NO ONE: ...  Me: JOE from YOU. 100000000% *heart eyes* such a handsome fella. <3
Your moms live reaction is so cute and pure! ❤️ so happy you’re happy Mia 🥰
😭😭😭😭 you guys are flippin adorable!!!! So happy for you two!!!!!!🤍
Its so good to meet you Stuart, You & Mia make a lovely couple. Your very Brave sitting in front of the camera being in the hot seat.  I can definitely see the Love radiantly between you both. Stuart as a look of Jamie Theakston a Radio DJ in England especially when Jamie was younger.
He looks so much like someone but I can’t put my finger on it. Ugh. I am so happy for you guys. Perfect couple❤️
He looks like Spider-Man ..  None of the actors just someone who becomes Spider-Man  Shy In front of people but kicks butt for justice
You guys are adorable ❤ awesome video!!
I had the biggest smile the whole time watching this video! So happy for you Mia! You guys are adorable 🥰
Okay so as soon as clicked on the video I had a list of a few celebs I thought he looked like, or has similar features of. I think he shares similar features with David Tennant, MatPat, and they way he speaks also reminds me of the guy from the DCOM Geek Charming and Troy’s understudy in HSM3, the actor’s name is Matt Prokop.
You make a beautiful couple thank you Stewart so much for being in Mias  video I know it took a lot of courage and compromise for you to do this for your future wife. She is such a sweet girl and you seem extremely kind and sweet and if your marriage is anything like her parents marriage he will be having a long happy one filled with lots of laughter and compatibility one thing my heavenly grandmother told me before I got married was “don’t spend five minutes on it if it won’t matter in five years” please do not argue and things that will not seriously matter in your life five Years from now. I beg you to take that advice. And definitely truly try to put yourself in the other persons shoes and think of them first. Also marriage is not about winning an argument but it’s about fighting for each other and what’s best for the marriage as a whole what is good for the dynamic of the two of you. Being right might feel good for a second but it does not feel good hurting your partner
Steward DEFINITELY reminds me of Shawn Mendes and Tom Holland. He seems to be such a calm and loving person, you can see it just by the way he looks at Mia most of the time. Congrats Mia❤️
your babies would have good eyebrows lol
Heeeeey he is so cute and nice 😍😍😍😍😍 Probably looks like shawn Mendes
Idk about celebrities but he looks like a hockey player! Or the trudeau guy 🤣 hahahah he’s cutee!
Aww, you guys are so cute together ❤️
Thank you for letting us meet him Mia! And thanks Stewart for willing to meet us! As for your last question, asking us who we think he looks like he reminds me of Penn Badgley. Not to say that he’s anything like Joe Goldberg, I just kept thinking Stewart looked like him while watching the video.
He looks a lot like MatPat from game theory!
Haha maybe not Johnny Depp, but the kid who played Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory??🤔 I think the actor was Freddie Highmore!
omg you both have the best teeth. i’m already jealous of you children😂
Pieces with Gemini is not a favorable match. As a Gemini I speak from experience. But one of the kindest hearts that ever loved me once was a Pisces. Love conquers all
They don’t seem like a good match 😬
11:35 that is the SWEETEST thing i have ever heard, mama deserves
Omg y’all are SO cute! Why did I think he was MatPat from game theory for a minute though?! 💀🙈
hi, Nice to meet you!
The way he looks at you 🥺 I love it!!!!! so happy for y’all!
I just can't stop smiling while watching this!!!!
Y’all are so cute together. Also he looks like what I imagined he would lol.
It's so nice that you both grew up going to the same school and being aware of each other! And both of you seem so connected to each other.
He looks like a young Benedict Cumberbatch!! Also thanks for sharing him! He did great and you guys fit so well together! ❤️
Why he's so cute ♥️
Aww you two are adorable!
Actually he looks a little like Tobey Maguire during his Spider-Man era 🙃
Y’all are a beautiful couple!!!!! He loves you so much you can tell by the way he looks at you and the fact that he’s willing to make this video with you!! I got engaged around the same time you did so I’m so stinkin excited to watch all your wedding videos or inspo🤩♥️♥️♥️
MIAAAA YOU LOOK LIKE RAPUNZEL FROM TANGLED AND HE’S FLYYYYNN!! He looks so much like a prince charming. Happy for you guys!! 🥺
He reminds me of Jack and Finn Harries!
The way he was seeing you all the time was super adorable ❤️

omg, i'm a pisces and my boyfriend is a gemini too!!! i'm not super into astrology either but apparently our venuses are compatible? maybe you should make a video looking at your charts! 👀
Idk if YouTubers call themselves celebrities but I think he looks very MatPat-esque. Thank you for agreeing to be in a video, I really enjoyed it!
You know how they say soulmates tend to look alike? Mia and Stewart look so much alike 😭 love that for them 🥰
oh my God you two look and behave like you're from a Disney movie, I cannot🥰🥰🥰 our princess Mia found herself a prince 🥰

MIA HES SO HOT. AND YOU ARE SO HOT!!!! (Yes I just started the video that is all I have to comment right now 😂😂😂 I’m sure he’s spectacularly kind too!!! Lolololol HOT!)  (Okay to answer your end question- he looks like Timothee Chalamet and Jacob Elordi!!!!)
Happy to meet you :)
He has Robert Pattinson qualities! Pale skin, brown eyes, how he styles his hair.   Happy for you two!!! 😁
I think he looks like MatPat from Game Theory. :)
I think he kind of resembles the main actor from kissing booth, Jacob Elordi when he was dating zendaya😅
My boyfriend thinks he looks a bit like the YouTuber CallmeKevin

FLYNN RIDER!!!
What a great couple 💑 you make.🤩❤❤💯
a mixture of penn badgley and matpat
I can totally picture Stuart as like Edward Cullen from twilight - not in a creepy way but how he's described to look in the books! Also kind of like Andrew Garfield? Since yall were talking about Spiderman 😅  So happy for yall! I'm so proud of the husband's and boyfriends and fiances that come in front of the camera for their partners - it takes courage. But the mia maples community will always welcome you Stuart!!
So happy for both of you! You seem perfect for each other 🥰  Do YOU get in with HIS family??
The way he looks at her🙈🥰
OMG I LOVE YOU GUYSSSS ❤️❤️❤️

When I started watching the video I 100% thought he looked like Tom Holland! Such a coincidence when you two started talking about spider man 😂
He looks like Dan from gossip girl I can't remember the actors name!
I saw this video and was screaming lol. Mia, I’m so happy for you two!!! You look perfect together ❤️❤️
It's so interesting that you asked if Stuart looks similar to any celebrity cause throughout the video I was thinking about how he reminds me of Hueningkai, a member of the kpop boyband Tomorrow×Together (he is half Korean and half German). Like just the way he nods his head or gives that shy grin reminded me so much of him.
You two look great together! Stewart, you're awesome!
Hi Harry
Okay but this is my favorite video ever
Do not come for me guys, but this gives me mega younger Fleur and Mike "deForce"  vibes. I feel so old now.
This is definitely one of the sweetest videos ever!! You guys are so cute together!! All the best for your journey ahead!
Does he look like Matt Pat from the side or am I going crazy? Probably both 😂
Literally Tom holland doppelgänger
I enjoyed the Mia way of saying if you are mean to him I will CUT you
Congratulations! You both seem so connected and seem to have so much fun! I think Stuart looks like Andrew Garfield! <3
He looks like Andrew Garfield
I am honestly dying from the cuteness 🥺🥺❤️❤️ you guys are perfecttttt
Stop it! I’m pisces and my ex was gemini close to taurus and did not really fit all the charecteristics of a gemini! How!!!😃😃 Stewart seems a really sweet and funny guy!
He looks like a younger MatPat from the Game Theorists… I was so shocked at first, cause I thought it was him 😂
He's name really suits him n he's really cute like really really cute 🥰😢😍😍
I'm middle aged and I've never been with a partner as sweet as yours.  Enjoy each other, you two are terrific.  xo
finally!!!i saw this and screamed
We ❤️ Stuart!!! So cute and funny! Thank you for coming on and sharing yourself with Mia’s world! It really speaks to your love and admiration for each other, to be so giving.
He is so cuteee .... I love your match ...💘💞💘💓💖💓
MY HUSBAND AND I ARE GEMINI AND PISCES!! his birthday is june 20 though so he is on the borderline too for cancer. and we get along great 😂
This is probably so out of left field but I think his somewhat celebrity look alike is Timothee Chalamet 😂 maybe it’s the side profile and hair idk
You guys complement each other so well, he looks so adorable and sweet. Thank you Stewart for making a big step to be in a video, but… YOU BETTER TREAT MIA RIGHT I’m just joking but YOU BETTER <3
Like Stuart more knowing we have the same birthday, big up Gemini/Taurus cusps
I laughed so hard, when he said “I have an extra button undone” 😂😂😂  All the best you two!
This was such a sweet video! Love how your fiance did this for you, such a kind act! Loved the video :)
I can’t at all with what an adorable couple you are!
I think we need to be bffs because my husband is a Gemini and I’m a Pisces too! My husband is not a typical Gemini either lol complete opposite 😂
What a sweet video! Glad that Stewart was able to be in a video and you guys are great together.  Would love to see the baking together video.❤
Stewart definitely reminds me of Shawn Mendes! Also you both look so cute together!
Your fiancé looks like Jeremy Gilbert from vampire diaries
I believe that Steward looks lime Gregg Sulkinin a certain way🥰

This makes me even more happy for you. He’s so sweet 🥺❤️

He looks like MatPat from Game Theory on YT. They look like brothers!!! Congratulations you two.
Aloha Mia & Stuart! I too am a Gemini on the cusp of Taurus, you guys will be fine, and you will never be bored with a ♊ Gemini😉.
He reminds me so much of Mason from Wizards of Waverly Place. But I can’t remember his real name!

The way your bodies align towards each other, how he cannot take his eyes off of you, the way you look at each other and just the vibeeeee!!! I was smiling throughout! This is what a great relationship looks like. This is the kind of person everyone should marry. Way to go both of you! Stay blessed! Oh and he's such a sweetheart!

Why did my brain already know what he was going to look like 🤔 you both look so happy cuteness overload🥰  Also please God one day bless me with eyebrows like Stewart/Stuart🥺
He looks like he could play Edward Cullen but a chill version and not so pained one lol. It’s the flowing locks and big eyes. So happy for you guys and am looking forward to future content! Enjoy the wedding planning process!
I don't know about stuart but Mia you really look like Lily Collins (Emily from Emily in Paris) imo
I was waiting for this reveal for so long !! Love the fact you are asking for doopelganger ! For me it is Jacob Elordi for sure!! It is a perfect match for you ! Welcome Stuart !!!
Hey Stuart happy to meet you, you guys look amazing together ❤ can't wait to see you in more videos 😊

This might be silly, but he's just like the man I visioned for you. He seams to be very nice and caring. I wish you guys the happiest life!!
You can see he is nervous and hiding behind Mia's eyes for comfort.  But hes is an absolute delight 11:32 succha cutie. 🥺
I thought her fiance is Matpat lol they look a like, is it just me?
Thanks Stuart for doing a video, and starting out with such a nervewracking one, too! You definitely looked more comfortable near the end than at the start :)
I was shocked when she said a Gemini....he doesn't look like he acts like a Gemini also I'm a Taurus 🐂

Try to not rewatch this video 1000 times. Fail❌
i think Stuart looks like a combination of andrew garfield and shawn mendes combined. the hair is very much shawn mendes
YEEEEEEEEEEEES THIS IS AWESOME
I can’t believe you asked at the end if he looks like a celebrity because I low key thought he was mason from wizards of waverly place when he first came on screen 😭
I watched this with my boyfriend and as soon as you asked who Stuart looks like he was like “young bob saget” 💀 ngl I kinda see it
My husband came in while I was watching this and he immediately said “her fiancé has the same voice as her brother” and now I can’t get over it. 🥴 Either way, he seems lovely and I am happy for you both!
You guys are so sweet ❤️
I always taught you looked like Rapunzel. Aaand your fiance looks like Flynn Rider. 😱😀😀
Ya'll make a lovely couple!  He kinda reminds me of Gabe from the office lol
Joshua Goldberg and Robert Pattinson mixed. But also I see a price charming from a none animated movie. Also a little bit of Alex pettyfer Jacob Elordi mixed. haha please make a video of your reaction finding out who you think he looks like reading our comments lol that would be great.  .. Joshua is the guy from the show YOU  Alex is from I am number 4  Jacob is from the kissing booth.  Also we know who Robert Pattinson is lol so I didn’t feel the need to explain where he’s from.   Hands down love your content n you both are a match made in heaven 💕.
Im soooo happy for the both of you!!! Ahhh!!! My life is complete ❤️❤️🥺🥺
I think he looks like Ian Harding from pretty little liars, was the first thing I said to my husband when we played the video lol. You guys are adorable and we're so happy for you guys! 💗
Great, another video that makes me feel soooo single.
You are really cute together 🥰🥰🥰 I dont mean it in a bad way but I dont know why he reminds me of Joe from You AHAHA
Stuart looks like a mix of the guy from You and the tall guy from Kissing Booth on Netflix
There's a lot more to a person than their Sun sign!!! lol Look up your birth charts online and figure out your moon and rising etc signs and the meaning behind each one. Look forward to seeing more of him in new vids :)
Aw Mia he’s so sweet and cute 🥺🤍 so happy we got to meet him!! I’m getting a little bit of a Andrew Garfield vibe from him?? Maybe it’s just me 😂

Awh Mia! He’s so handsome! And seems like such a sweetheart! I’m so happy for y’all! 🥰
His celeb lookalike is Penn Badgley 💯
Mia you're  also on the cusp of Aries so that could be why you get along with both Sagittarius and Gemini!
As a gemini taurus cusp. I agree 100%

Not as doppelganger but he reminds me of Daniel Radcliffe
Lol my bf is a pisces and I'm a Gemini
U guys are beautiful together
Omg u look so cute together 😍 all the happiness in the world for the couple ❤
Welcome Stewart. 🌺 To anwser Mia's question,"does he look like a celebrity?". I think he kinda looks like Shawn Mendes a little bit. Think it's the hair and eyes. May you guys be blessed with so much love and happiness.🌺
I wish you two be like this forever, oh god so happy for you 🧿
I love you Mia. And now I love Stewart too! I wish you guys so much happiness 💖💖💖💖💖 I'm from Argentina 🇦🇷
He reminds me a little of the dad from full house?! In the best way! You guys look great together, looking forward to more wedding content soon 💒 👰‍♀️ 🤵‍♂️
He kinda looks like Tom Holland
aww, its so nice to meet your fiance and see yall together! such a cute couple!
all i can say for a fact you gon have some nice kids with some FIRE eyebrows
When he hit us with "I have an extra button undone" I felt that in my soul. I love Mia but I only wish I could pull off her style!
I almost broke my finger trying to click on this because I did it so fast! I’m SO glad Stewart was comfortable enough to be in the “hot seat”. It’s hard to answer questions on camera when you aren’t used to it. You did GREAT, Stewart! I love how you look at each other. 💖💗💞
for celeb doppelgangers - he looks like a mix between matpat and david tennant lol! (and fleurdeforce's husband mike) such a sweet video! nice to meet u stuart!
“I have an extra button undone” 😭 y’all are so cute!!!!
💕
Matt Pat from food, film ,and game theory
Shawn Mendes, especially with that hairstyle.
There's definitely some celebrity resemblance to Ryan McCartan. Also I'm so happy for you both. You look like such a lovely couple.
My first thought was that he looks like matpat from the gametheory channel here on youtube :P
Is it just me or does he kinda look like Greg Sulkin?
Timothee Chalamet
Definitely not a Gemini, seems more like a Virgo to me. Seems like a very nice guy 👍🏻

You look so cute together!! I'm so happy for you!!<3
Such a cute videoo 😍
Is it just me or does Stewart/ Stuart look kinda like Andrew Garfield but with a different nose, you guys are so cute together and I’m so glad he’s comfortable to be on camera now <3
He looks like Ken Baumann from the show The Secret Life Of The American Teenager!
Beautiful couple 😍

Just because you like someone doesn’t mean you’re a loser if it’s not reciprocated. Wish you both the best in the future muah! 😘
Wait, is Stuart’s birthday May 21st?! Cause I’m a cusp between Gemini and Taurus and I was born on May 21st. 😁
Aw what a sweetheart he is! 💕 So excited to follow you in your next chapter 💕

Hi Stuart!!
I think he looks like Timothee Chalamet
Stuart looks like a mix of Henry Cavill and a young Tom Cruise imho. Put that with Mia's lovely Audrey Hepburn looks and they are a gorgeous couple and more importantly beautiful on the inside too. Thanks for the video btw 💏

1. You two are adorable! 2. Doppelgänger is definitely MatPat! I refuse to accept any other comparisons. 😂😂😂
It's so great to meet you & yes, that's an odd thing to say to a complete stranger.  However,  it's one on the wonderful things about YouTube.  As a viewer, you become invested emotionally in the people you enjoy viewing.  They touch your life in unexpected ways & you care about them. There are several YouTube creators I've watched for many years.  Watching their families grow,  pets,  their life experiences... it's pretty wonderful.  Anyway,  you're a lovely couple & I can say, you're the man we would all choose for Mia. 😁😁🥰🥰🥰
I'm so happy we got to meet Stuart! He seems so sweet and caring; you two have great chemistry. Celebrity wise, it's not a perfect match, but he gives me Gregg Sulkin vibes.
Yesss hi fiancé!! Thank you for doing this video for us! You guys are so sweet and good for each other
Aw this makes me SO happy! Thank you Stuart for coming on, and thank you Mia for sharing this part of your life with us! I agree with alot of the comments saying he looks like Gregg Sulkin, I also get an essence of Shawn Mendes. Not sure what it is, but that's not a bad thing! Anyway you two are such Cuties and seem like such a great match
Hi Stewart, welcome officially to our online community. Happy to have you here ❣️ You remind me of MatPat 😉
Yall are so cute i can't  🥰
I love that they can't stop looking at each other. I wish you the best in this new phase.
This was so cute! Welcome Stuart 😊 I say really young Johnny Depp & my husband says Joe from You lol
He looks like Walt Jr from Breaking Bad!
Ohhhh he’s so nice, and I love the way the looks at you, and the you look at him, you’re such a beautiful couple!  PS: I feel like he looks a little bit like Shawn Mendes 👀
I'm so happy for you two, YOU LOOK SO CUTE TOGETHER! Welcome to the virtual fam Stuart! 🤩🤩 I think Stuart gives me vibes of Grant Gustin.... I DONT KNOW WHYYY
💜💜💜💜💜
You guys are so cute, having so much fun watching this video, cheers to many more videos in the future 😍 welcome to the club, Stuart  🥂🎉😄 and btw, i agree with Mia about that crushes thingy. I mean if you love somebody it's a great thing and not a shame. if they have the same feeling or maybe not, both are fine, no hard feelings and awkwardness.  Sadly, it's still a problem here because of so many reasons lol.
This video made me smile so much, wish you two all the best! Also I really like Mia's take on telling someone you like them
Idk if he’s considered a celebrity, but he definitely looks a lot like Mat Pat! Loved the video! The way he looks at you just melts my heart😭
He is so cute thank you to him that he is with u love u and when are u getting married   ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He reminds me of a young David Tennent! (The style, mannerisms and *essence*) You two are absolutely adorable together 💜
You look great together, I hope you two have a wonderfull wedding day
Love him! He has great energy and it’s easy to see that he’s perfect for you. Happy for you both. And he does seem way more Taurus than Gemini. Just saying.
Kinda looks like Joe from YOU on Netflix 🙂
I think you're putting him on the spot a bit but I love the video! He seems to be a humble & nice guy which is amazing!!!
He reminds me of Tate for some reason.
He’s looks like Joe Goldberg 😅😍
He kinda looks like Gregg Sulkin!
He totally reminds me of Joe from the show You on netflix 😂
I envisioned Bella Swan’s wedding dress when you were asking your fiancé questions about the kind of dress he’d like to see on you haha
We're so happy to meet him!!! You guys are so cute together. I think he kinda looks like Shawn Mendes.
This might be my favourite video you've ever done it was so super cute!!!! You guys are so compatible and in love its adorable 😍😍😍
Giiirrllll!!! My first thought was “she has her own Timothée Chalamet” and you finish the video with that question 😂 Oh, Mia, he’s so cute I’m glad you found someone as good as you, wish you all the happiness in the world 💕
Omgg this is exactly how I imagined him to be 😂 so happy for u mia ❤️
Not necessarily a celebrity but he reminds me SO MUCH of Fleur De Force’s husband!!
Eeeeeeeekkk I'm sooo excited!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🤩🤩❤  He seems sweet, good for you! 🙏🏻❤😊  Edit: Excuse me though, Mia would 100% be a quokka, have you seen these animals and how happy they are??? Definitely her vibe.
Hiii Stuart!! Love that he is so close with mama maples! Welcome!
Stuart’s serving major Shawn Mendes vibes 🔥
Sobbing because I'm so happy for you!!
He is a Gentleman
He is very handsome!
Stewart looks like chip?? Just me but he does!!! You guys are so cute, thanks Stewart!!!
Loved this video ✨❤️
Mia where is your turtleneck from?!?! I love it so much!
He's definitely giving big British actor energy. Robert Pattinson immediately came to mind. Or like Eddie Redmayne/ Matt Smith
So sweet mia!! Perfect couple!
beautiful to watch you blushed so much I can see him keeping you grounded he seems like he has a good head on his shoulders for sure
I'm totally on board with a red panda :D you're like two little cute brave red pandas together
I find that Pisces and Gemini both just never give up on anything super important. I'm a Pisces and my husband is a Gemini and we have been together now 19 years with 2 kids. Every relationship has ups and downs and I am not sure zodiac signs really make a difference when it comes to love. I totally agree with the signs accuracy in behaviors and its good to know how others will act in different situations so that you can understand eachother better.
Hi Harry
David Tennant vibes, that’s his celeb doppelgänger. 💯
1. You're right that Gemini x Pisces are not compatible BUT you need to look at his total birth chart to get the complete picture! The Rising sign and the Moon sign have just as much impact as the Sun sign, so don't stress about it 😌 (I'm a fellow Pisces sister!)  2. Stewart looks like a young Robert Pattinson!!!
"I have an extra button undone". 😆😆 so cute ❤️
I feel so single watching this😭
BRO💀💀💀*IT... ADORI*😭😭😭😭
The way he grabbed your hand when you put yours on his chest, I died. I think you are such a great couple and it seems like you just compliment each other so nicely 🥰✨✨
U guysss ♥️♥️♥️
he is so handsome but in a vampire way lol like edward from twilight..yummy man
Made for eachother..🥰
you guys are so cute and quirky😩❤️
He literally looks like Andrew Garfield
Aw I feel like y’all were made for each other so cute!!!
The most important thing to me in this video is final link to the zucchini recipe for the lasagna. JK you guys are so cute together but also that link if possible
He looks like MatPat from game theory ;p
Awe love him!! 🥺
2 hours edited down to 22 minutes? 😫 so much we're missing out on
Stewart jaw line 😍❤️
stewart is a human vision of chip.

omg i’m so glad you asked STEWART 100% LOOKS LIKE MATPAT NO DOUBT
To answer your question, Mia, he looks like if Grant Gustin and Freddie Highmore had a baby.
You just dont know how happy iam right now 😭
I usually don’t comment on videos but you guys are the cutest ever!! I’m so happy for you Mia 🥺🥺🥺 as for his celebrity doppelgänger, i really think he looks like Gregg Sulkin and that guy from the movie Enola Holmes (Louis Partridge) basically he looks kinda British to me haha
Doppelgänger: he looks kinda how i imagine the real life Flynn Rider
Welcome Stewart!❤️
You two are adorable
Does anyone else think that stuart looks like matpat?
He look like the Genie on Once Upon a Time in Wonderland
I love the way he looks at you 😭♥️
Is it me or does he look a bit like Gregg Sulkin. Especially from the eyes and up
I don't know if Stewart looks like any celebrities but as soon as I saw his face I immediately thought of MatPat!!

YESS MIA YOU ARE FUNNY😆 and I think Stewart looks like a celebrity. but I can't remember the name I think my sister show me that guy from any series
Not really a celebrity but I think he looks a bit like Mike DeForce?
The way he just looks at Mia makes me so happy, this is what I imagine love to look like, welcome Stuart we are very happy to have you here!
You both make such a nice couple 😭 also he is a very beautiful man 💞 love both of u
Thank you to Stewart for being so kind to Mia's fanbase and joining a video even though he is a private person and shy/nervous to be on camera. 💜 gracias and i wish you both the best for your relationship
He’s so cute!!! He’s seems like such a sweet heart 🥺
When I first saw him I immediately thought of Edward from Twilight and her kinda sounds like him too 😅😊
I’m in a Taurus-Pisces relationship and we don’t get on at all lol
I smiled the whole way through this video! Hiiiiii Stewart!
I had to pause the video and write this comment. Mia your fiancé has some of the best eye brows I’ve ever seen…and you guys are going to make beautiful children one day (if you choose to). I’m so so happy for the both of you and I cannot wait to see what the future holds!!!!
Me and my husband are a picese and a Gemini and we've been together almost 18 years so I don't think that's anything to worry about :)
Stuart looks like if somehow Shawn Mendes and Robert Downey Jr had a child... I will not elaborate
ok very cute and sweet, loved this. ALSO: fiancé looks like JAMES MCAVOY big time
Love u guys soo much ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
If he’s  more Taurus.. lean into that! Me a Pisces  has been with my man a Taurus for almost 10 years ❤️‍🔥 it’s a true match!
I get Rob Pattinson vibes. Oh Mia I'm so happy for you he seems like your perfect match.
Stewart look like Robert Pattinson to me he is adorable Mia!
It’s so nice to finally meet you Stuart!! Thank you for doing this video!!! I’m so happy for you and Mia!! You guys are absolutely perfect for each other!!! 💜💜💜💜💜
OMG this video was so fun! Has me smiling and laughing! Also Mia you ARE funny! Never doubt. For celebrity lookalike…he looks like a combo of Gregg Sulkin and Freddie Highmore 😊
Awww they look so good together and congratulations Mia 😘💜💜

I’m so happy you’re happy
he looks like cole sprouse
You both literally like Prince and Princess at Disneyland 🥺 Nice couple. Thanks for revealing and agreeing to be in the camera 🥰 Such a beautiful story on how you guys met and all in the circle of life
I did not expect to meet you fiancé today! What a great surprise. And let me just say I thought before we are much a like but now am like 100% sure, my husband looks like Stuart 😁😁😁
I think he looks like the guy from the kissing booth but don't know his name
So glad to finally meet him!! Y’all are so adorable 😍😍
there’s ligit a song in high school musical the musical the series and the first lyric is “ima pisces your a gemini, your the brightest star in the east high sky” totally relates to y’all!
Oh my gosh he looks very similar to RJ Mitte or Walter White Jr from Breaking Bad! Definitely his celebrity look alike! So happy he warmed up to the idea of being on your channel I can’t wait to watch you both build your lives together!!
So excited to see you to together on the channel uncensored! Welcome Stuart!
STEWART!!!! omfg he is so great!! smiling so big (,:
You guys look so adorable together 🥲❣ you can feel the love between you guys. I'm so happy for you guys! 🧡 Been watching you for the longest
Before when he was blurred I thought he looked like the guy from twighlight saga
You guys are so sweet together 😁  As for lookalike, Stuart reminds me of Mattpatt 😊
Stewart looks like a cross between Drew Gooden and MatPat.
Welcoooome! You seem so nice and genuine ❤️ I’m looking so much forward to seeing you more on the channel.  I must say- I believe his celebrity look-alike is Matt Patt, am I wrong?
awe he seems so sweet. he matches you so well.
I was smiling throughout the whole video hehe thank you for uploading Miaaa !
I was smiling throughout the whole video, you guys are so cute❤💕Also he kind of looks like a mix of Ross Lynch and Joe from the show You
How can we be mean? He’s adorable (and to my ancient eye… I need to put this here for context), he looks extremely young… This means: I’m getting old! 🤨😐
To answer you question Mia: He looks like a soft mixed version of Shawn Mendez and Thomas Brodie Sangster  Also, thaaaank you so much for making this video, I'm obsessed😍😍😍
What is wrong with Gemini’s?
You guys are so cute😍
He's adorable. He did great. Best wishes to both of you.
We need to know your and his, moon and rising sign, sometimes it’s more relatable
I was not expecting that
STUART COULD LITERALLY BE A SPIDER-MAN 😭 He is so handsome Mia! You two look so perfect together and the energy is immaculate! I am so happy for you! ❤️❤️❤️
UGH I CAN'T Y'ALL TWO ARE TOO CUTE ❤️❤️
Mia I am so unbelievably happy for you! You two seem so perfect for each other. I’d also really like to recommend that you find a corrective exercise specialist to try to help with your chronic pain. They’re like the bridge between physical therapy and unhindered movement/ exercise. Feel free to contact me with any questions 💜
Great job Stuart (stewart?).  I also loved seeing another side of Mia in this video.  Is he going to work with team maples like mama and tate on video production stuff now too?  Or does he have a different career field?
To answer your question about if he looks like any celebrity, I think he looks like a young David Tennant!!! It was my immediate thought when I saw him!
Gregg sulkin
He is so funny
He's lovely, but you are going to have the palest, lily-white babies. Super attractive pale babies.
I laughed when the Spider-Man comment came up because I immediately thought of Andrew Garfield when I first saw him.
Hugh Grant
i don’t know why but somehow stuart looks english to me, i was expecting him to have english accent lol. he also gives me freddie highmore vibes i guess? not very similar appearance wise but definitely has the same vibes as him like calm and quiet but sweet. you look so cute as a couple, such a match made in heaven! God bless💗
OMG adorableeeeeeeeee
U guys are so fucking cute
he seems soooo sweeeettttt aweeeeeeeeeeeee <3
the way he looks at her !! so happy for them they look just perfect together

You said at the begginig you were going to answer questions too!!! How dare you make him answer all these alone. You should have answered some more tooo
He is so sweet! 😍 good job on your first appearance on her channel! 👏 and congratulations on the engagement 💍 😃
From the side profile he reminds me of MatPat  from GameTheory.
Aww he is so sweet and handsome! Yall are cute togerher!
He looks like Joe from You!
A Celeb look alike could be milo ventimiglia but only slightly 🤔
Hi Mia! You both seem so sweet together, such a cute couple! The first thing I thought when his face appeared was that he looks like Patrick Schwarzenegger
You guys are so cute together 🥰 I love that you don't push him too hard to be in your videos, he'll always be grateful for that I'm sure 😉 thank you for introducing yourself Stewart!(I'm sorry if I spelled your name wrong)
This video put a huge smile on my face :) thank you! It’s nice to meet you 😇🙌🏼
Omg your fiancé is MatPat from Film Theory😮

Omg 👁️👄👁️ he's gorgeous! Omg Mia i'm so happy for you and him!
Don't know if i should say this but she is hyping up so much on insta abt her fiance like.... Girl, calm dowm
We love Stuart! Thank you so much for being in the vid. I can't wait to see you in future videos 😀
Iam scared that somebody is mean
Such a lovely couple🥺 it’s so obvious how in love you guys are, thank you for sharing that with us all. Hope we get to see Stuart more often and get to see more of the two of you together❤️ as for celeb look alike, I see a little of Jacob Elordi especially from the side!
I think he looks like a mixture of Gregg Sulkin (Mason from Wizards of Waverly Place) and Jacob Elordi (Noah from The Kissing Booth)!
He looks like Jacob elordi, God bless you both 💫
You guys are a cute couple.  Just wondering which way he spells his name - au or ew?  Sorry, the teacher in me is coming out.
I have been told that i seem like a  taurus-gemini cusp. Lol But my bday is May 26 😂 I feel the same way. Im quite, awkward, love food, am private with my relationship (don't post much on social media) I was supposed to be a Taurus but was almost 3 weeks late. My husband is a Capricorn
Matt pat 😦 ps I’m so happy for you guys ☺️❤️
He has a great side profile! The way he looks at you 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 you are so in love MiA
Its Joe from YOU !!! Love you guys ❤️

I feel like Stuart reminds me of Matthew Patrick! (MatPat's channel)
It's the way he looks at you😭💖💖
Mia and Stuart: I'm SO happy for youuu! (And a little jealous but in a good way hehe). Props for Stuart for stepping out of his comfort zone in the name of love! Hahah. Also the whole Time I was like "he looks familiar" but my knowlegde about celebs Is really low sorry 😅. Wish you the best! Love u, bestie! 💖💖💖 Edit: He kinda looks like Greg Sulkin! (Not sure if its spelled right.
From the side, he kinda looks like Mat Pat.
so so happy for you both yous are absolutely perfect together!! congratulations once again 🥰🎉  i feel he looks a lot like joshua bassett feature wise! maybe a mix of him and gregg sulkin i think!
I think Stuart looks like who played the warewolf in Wizards of Waverly place. Gregg Sulkin :)
You both are like the fictional people I used to imagine in my head when I used to read a lot of ya novels!!! pretty quirky girl and boy next door vibe aghahaywhahawjsjsj it's a compliment
All of these questions are mostly about MIA, I would like to know more about Stewart like what he does for a living what’s her favorite food how old is he how many siblings does he have what does his parents think about Mia Does he love dogs or cats etc. etc.
I totally was thinking through the video that Stewart kind of looks like Shawn Mendes! Also love you two so much, so perfect for each other!

This was so sweet!! The way he looks at you🥺🥺 I think his doppelgänger is Gregg Sulkin.
He resembles Andrew Garfield tbh
OMG YOU BOTH LOOK ABSOLUTELY  BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER!!!! OMG!!!
Why am I seeing Jacob Elordi and Shawn Mendes every few second 😂 love the video btw!
Why you always copy famous utuber tina young you doing the same as tina did in her previous videos make ur own content
*Ok but when is he trying on wish clothing lol*
I don't like Zodiac Signs because when people ask and I tell them I'm a Gemini they think I'm crazy even though I'm literally scared of everything and am a huge introverted shy person
He is s sweet! He can't stop look at you! Maybe it's also stres but I see how much he is adore you!  You are such a wonderful couple! 😍😍😍
Hope you feel more comfortable now ❤️ they look so perfect for each other. Can’t wait to see you both in videos 😊
I think his look alike is ✨YOU✨
Stewart is a doll! And your question about whether Stewart resembles any celebrities… to me he is a mix of Macauley Culkin, Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield.
You guys are so cute. Already love Stewart so much, I look forward to seeing him in future videos! ♥️
I have an extra button undone Lmfao
The way they look at each other my god. You can tell that they're happy and so in love with each other. So happy for you both.

You guys are so sweet. Happy for you both 🤍
Because you were talking about spiderman I think he looks a little bit like andrew garfield haha 😂
I would love for you and your fiance and you and your mom to do an astrology reading together that dives deeper into your actual birth charts (looking at other planets other than the sun-pisces for you) Because commericialized astrology doesn't even begin to explain why pisces and sag or pisces and gemini actually have great potential if the rest of their chart is more harmonious. Would love to explain this more, as I do this professionally and just love actually showing people how dope astrology is when its not used to profit off of.
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖

Well I guess this means I have to give up hope of you some day meeting my son and marrying him, lol.  But, Stewart is adorable and you look like a good match together.  Very happy for you!

Honestly the Twilight movies comment in a previous video was enough for me to decide this man is not only good enough but GREAT also SUCH AMAZING HAIR
Lol loved “I have an extra button undone” for taking risks!
U2 look so cute together. Nice to finaly meet the  mistery man behind the blur. Great video!
I am so happy Stewart (I hope I spelled his name right) decided to join Mia in a video but we totally understand if he doesn’t want to be shown in later videos because it is his privacy but we that he decided to join Mia. This video is so cute. When I first saw him he looked familiar but I don’t know like who ik there’s someone but I don’t know who
I love how attentive he is to Mia💛
Hey Mia! I am a Gemini and my husband is Pisces.  We will celebrate our 6th anniversary next Sunday, so it works pretty well :D But I also always read that we do not fit together from the zodiac sign of view
I'm so happy for the both of you <3 and is it just me, or is there a slight resemblence to MatPat? I wish you all the best <3
Omg! He's adorable! You 2 look so good together. Thanks for being brave enough to sit in the hot seat and answer a few questions. Looking forward to seeing you in more videos with Mia.🥰🤗
So excited to meet your other half! Stuart, you're beyond sweet to do this with Mia. I adore watching you together,you're a great match! I understand you being nervous about putting yourself out there but this is a safe space 🙂
Aaahh he is so cute!! And he is looks a lot of that guy from the kissing booth!
He looks like a sweeter version of Jacob Elordi!!!!
I commend him for agreeing to put himself out there for you...oh the love!! 😍💙
Welcome to the channel officially!! So nice seeing you guys interacting together without a blurred face lol you seem so kind and sweet, can’t wait to see more of you in the future! It will get easier with time being in front of the camera but you did great!!!
Awww, him saying “I have an extra button undone” 🥺 to argue he is taking more “risks” was adorable! You guys are the cutest , and despite him probably not being 100% himself, you can tell you have chemistry and he adores you for you and I’m so excited you found your person❤️ wishing you both the best future together!
it's so funny you mentioned the celebrity thing, because the whole time i kept thinking "damn he looks so much like Shawn Mendes"! Welcome to our youtube community Stuart!
I just love how happy they both are,  they are an adorable couple and I love this!!
You guys complement each other so well💗🥺
He’s literally the kind of man that’s written by women 😭❤️ you two are perfect!!!
Pete Davidson vibes but not Pete Davidson personality vibes
he looks like matpat
HE LOOKS LIKE JOSHUA BASSETT from high school musical, the musical, the series. [Olivia Rodrigo's ex she's always singing about]!
If anybody scares him away from Mia I'm gonna call the police
You both are so cute❤️

THE MORE U GROW UP THE MORE U’LL BE LIKE UR RISING SIGN. HE IS A RISING TAURUS? PEOPLE NEEDS TO KNOOOE

Timothy chalamet
He gave me david arquette vibes when I first saw him!
I don’t know if it counts as a celebrity but he looks like Prince Eric from Little Mermaid
Love love watching both of you.Had alot of fun watching the video and congratulation once again.
ngl, every once in a while whenever he moved his head, he look like Robert or idk what his name is, that Edward Cullen guy. or he look like a grown up version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory except more mature face instead of Charlie's usual baby face 😂
Joshua Bassett
I am so happy he finally showed his face! Congrats to you both on your upcoming wedding xo.
You're such a lovely couple 👩‍❤️‍👨! All the best for you ♥️
He looks like Edward from twilight haha
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO IS SMILING UNTIL THE END OF THE VIDEO? 😭😭😭 MY HEART HUHUH I LOVE YOU BOTH

You guys look perfect together, I'm so happy for you Mia!!!! You deserve all the happiness in the world!!
I smiled the whole time🥰
You guys are so cute together😭, the minute I saw him I thought he look exactly like young David Tennant but that might just be me 😂
Im glad he doesn't dive into browns. It is probably my least favorite clothing color.
I love the way you look together 🥺❤️ only have the best wishes for both of you 🥰
Haiiiiiii Stuart. Nice to meet you. You both are perfect together 😭❤️❤️ love you both... Happy for you .
omg you guys are adorable 🥺🥺 I watched the whole video with a smile on my face, the way he looks at you is so sweet!! I'm so happy he felt comfortable enough to be in a video, can't wait to see more of you two together in other more relaxed videos 🥰
Why am I emotional watching this and reading the comments?? 😭 I’m so happy for you both! You are so cute together and seem made for each other! I love that he is comfortable enough to come on the channel and “meet” all of us. I don’t worry about any negativity from this audience since everyone is always so positive and supportive. Mia is so lucky to have an audience like this, I’ve been watching YouTube for years and I’ve never seen an audience that’s so positive! I don’t even comment often either; at least I don’t think I’ve commented on any of Mia’s videos at all but this is a special occasion haha. So happy to meet the ever so mysterious fiancé! 💛💛
Yess both of you baking something together sounds so good❤😍😍 definitely would love to watch it 😊

He seems so sweet! Can definitely see you two together, you two seem to balance each other's personality out (you being more extroverted and he's more introverted). Glad he felt comfortable enough to come on the channel!
I’m so happy for the both of you!  Also the fact that he had a necklace made for your mom too?!?! What a sweetheart 🥰

I love your dynamic, you can tell how much fun you have together!
I was waiting for this video all day !!! I never know what time you post so I kept looking :'(  Why was i so impatient you ask ? Well you would think that it's because I really wanted to see the fiancé but no, I was actually just so anxious for him that I wanted to be done with it lmao For real, I would be soooo anxious in his position !  Thank you so much for agreeing to make a video ! I hope the nice messages from everyone help you be more confident about appearing in videos :) We're all pretty nice so I hope you like us lmao Love you guys ♥
So happy we were able to meet him even if it's just this 1 video that he feels comfortable w. Your audience is literally the kindest.  The one channel I've never seen a hate comment on so I don't think you have anything to worry about mia ❣❤ congrats to you both ❣❣
I never clicked this fast Mia. I am soo invested in your life, I need help. 😭
Aw hi you guys are cute!! Thanks for doing the video
You guys are just so beautiful together! Thank you for being in the video!
Wow Stuart is adorable and precious but imo he has his own look
He kinda looks like Penn Badgley 😊 So happy for you Mia I adore you and your mom so much y’alls videos make my day!
You two are adorable
Hell, I know I'm funny!
He looks like Penn Badgley!! The actor on the tv show “you”! So happy to meet you Stewart, you guys are so adorable 💗
he is so funny!!! welcome to the maples fam stuart!
Thank you for sharing Stuart with us! This did not let us down!  Before your question at the end, I already thought to myself Stuart is a mix of Shawn Mendes and Penn Badgley. Such a cutie!
I thought your fiancé was matpat for a second, I was so confused 😂😂
HE DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE THE STALKER GUY FROM THE SERIES “YOU” but in the best way possible 😂
Firstly, thank you to your fiance for agreeing to be in a video! And secondly, YOU TWO ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER. We now understand why you two became couple, it's just meant to be. ❤️  Edit: The way Stuart looks at Mia 🤧 Can genuinely feel the love and adoration
Lmao I feel like a proud mom
Stuart or Stewart however it’s spelt I feel looks a bit like Robert Pattinson
A little timothée chalamet 💕
You two are so cute. As to doppelgänger, he reminds me of Eddie Redmayne.
Mia your fiance is so handsome and sweet you guys make a Beautiful couple
Omg you two together are SO fricking cutee!!  I could sense the chemistry between you even through the screen and with all the embarrassment of him doing something for the first time, at some point I felt I was almost third-wheeling tbh lol. Anyway you are so obviously compatible and, from what I could grasp, he seems like a very funny guy. He's so visibly in love with you it makes my heart so light omg I'm gonna cry I'm so happy for you two, couldn't wait any longer to see you together!   Ps. OMG Mia he's so handsome!!
I'm so happy for mia😭😭😭😭 It's been so long since she shared this part of her life with us. we're grateful!!' ❤️❤️❤️
he looks like he could play spider man honestlyy
Ahhh definitely need a video with Chip. ☺️🙋🏻‍♀️   Andrew Garfield/Shawn Mendes for sure!
2 minutes in and they are so adorable together!!!
Oh my god the celeb question! He definitely looks like Penn Badgley!!! The guy who plays Joe in You! But also Andrew G vibes, and Drew Gooden (youtuber)
They look so good together😩✨

Sweet video 👍👍Jacob Elordi look alike 😁😁
Mia: “don’t be mean to him”  Then Mia proceeds to bully him through the video. 😂 That’s how you know it’s a real one though. I wanna know how Mia’s relationship with his family is!
He loves u so much the way he look at u is out of the world that's so amazing i love it he looks so caring and sincere  May u both live with each other and blessed 🌻❤
Missed the opportunity to say "if you're a bird im a bird" 😩
You look so cute together! He kinda looks like a young Rupert Everett!
"with your curly hair and big glasses" THAT'S SO CUTE
I hope you feel comfortable being on screen more and if not, I hope you know you can always go back to not being in video's. You two look so cute together, I'm so happy for you and wish you all the best! It's probably weird to read all the comments from people you don't know but I'm sure everyone here has the kindest intentions ♡

Congrats to you and Stuart! So glad he decided to be in a video. I think he reminds me of The Princess Diaries Michael Moscovitz, but then I see a darker haired Andrew Garfield and some of his words remind me of Robert Pattinson (but not looks.).
I've waited the whole day for this! (It's 7pm in Germany). You look so cute and in love ❤️ Looking forward to new videos with both of you!
I’ve been refreshing my page all day waiting for this! Nice to meet you Stuart! You guys are adorable together 🥰

Such a cute video! Glad we finally got to meet him! You guys are too cute. 💕 As soon as I saw him I thought he looked quite like Gregg Sulkin (Mason from Wizards of Waverley Place)
The fact that he still did the video means he loves you so much Mia. Also the fact he barely looks at the camera is even adorable as it also shows he loves you. Omg, we just met Stuart and you guys are already so cute.
I love getting to meet your love, Mia! Thank you Stuart, for sharing a bit of yourself with us. 😍
I loved this video so much!! And to answer your question, I think he looks a lot like Penn Badgley (the actor that plays Joe Goldberg in You)
It is like two golden retrievers coming together and starting a family

He looks like a younger MattPatt

This is so sweet❤️🥺🥲
I'm a Pisces and my husband is a Gemini.. we're complete opposites but we always make it work.. ♡
AAAAAAAAA i love you two!!!! he is amazing I'm so happy for you Mia !!! am I the only one who thought the second I saw him he looked a little bit and acted a little bit like Robert Pattinson? lol
im sry but the edit of you mom was adorable
I'm so happy he finally agreed to be filmed!! Very cute couple, OTP!! (official true pairing ♡)  Also, I'm Taurus!! Fully in rising and waning. I got more Taurus than Gemini vibes from Stuart ^-^
He seems so sweet, and the way they look at each other warms my heart
Golden retriever energy!!!!

stewart looks like Penn Badgley to me!!
You guys are so cute
So happy that Stewart agreed to be in a video, so brave of him! Also I was getting Sebastian Stan vibes for a celeb look-a-like.
I’ve been waiting!!!!! 😝😝😝
I watched the whole video thinking to myself he looks like a young Bob Saget. I'm shocked that you asked that lol
Hi Stuart, nice to meet you! 💫💫 About the celebrity look alike thing I think he looks a lot like MatPat. Right???????
That's so sweet. You two are extremely perfect to one another.
I got sad when she played his Spotify even though he said no, lol. He’s a perfect fit for Mia!!!
AHHHHHHH WHAT
So happy for you Mia! He looks like a great match to you and your family:) also celebrity wise he kinda reminds me of Joe from the show ‘You’ LOL
Oh my gosh I love him! He's so relaxed and it seems like you really complete each other! So excited for more video's with him 🥰
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR THIS VIDEOOOO
He kind of looks like an older version of Noah Schnapp from stranger things 😁 by the way, good job Stuart 👏 you seem like a great person, and we can se the love in the air 😁
I'm getting a Seth Cohen mixed with David Tennant vibe. I'm so happy for the two of you! Whenever he is comfortable we would love more videos!
Stewart seems like such a sweet genuine person! I think he resembles Charlie Cox a bit (Actor who plays Dare Devil)
You should go to a physiotherapist, there's little scientific evidence showing a benefit of doing chiropractic adjustments.
Y’all are both beautiful humans! Somehow he’s how I imagined!
Pls you guys are so cute together! Happy for yall!
Welcome to the family Stewart! Don't be nervous, Mia's subscribers are very supportive!
Honestly i think he looks like tom holland idk why ❤️❤️❤️

Just the way he looks at Mia .. 😍😍😍
He kinda looks like MatPat aka Game Theory
Awww you guys are so cute!!! 💕💕💕💕
Aww he seems so sweet 🥲 you guys are the cutest I love it
Making a debut on a YouTube channel isn’t an easy feat but he did amazing!!💛
You guys are soooo cute together🥰😭❤
I see him looking like a mix of Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland oddly enough since you just talked about them!
Okay but the way he looks at u though 😩❤️
Your love story sounds like from romance book 🥺 He looks like really sweet guy and you are the sweetest girl match made in heaven! ❤️
So glad to meet you! You two are just so absolutely cute together!!
Omg MIA !!!!!! I wasn’t ready 🥰🥰🥰 He so cute 🏆 yu guys are adorable ❤️ and God bless you guys for saying Toby ! I was scared for a second 🤣🤣
You are perfect together! ❤
That spark, that chemistry, that love!❤️
Hi, welcome here, you look so cute together, it’s so nice to meet you! You DO look like a celebrity, but I’m not sure who
this guy needs to be protected at all costs
This was so lovely to watch, thanks Stewart for being in a video! Also he kind of looks like a Andrew Garfield/ Cedric Diggory crossover 😂
I think Stewart looks sooo much like Jacob Elordi !!!
Hey Mia and Stewart (so sorry if I spelled your name wrong 😳) I clicked this video so fast lol. The vibes I'm getting from this video make me so happy!! Can't wait to see all the wedding vids and more with the two of you. Mia you are such a kind and beautiful soul and I'm so glad you have your special person who makes your light shine even brighter! Wishing you both an abundance of love and happiness! 💚💚💚
You guys are so cute, and he seems so sweet and funny!
Sun signs mean so little of a person, there’s tropical and sidereal astrology and then your houses and placements. It’s a whole thing! Sun signs does not define someone. Loved this video so much Mia 🧡🌞
The cutest couple 💓 BTW he's more of a young Tom Cruise.
Very excited to get to see the reveal and he did so good! It takes a lot of courage to put yourself in front of that camera and we are all here for you and him! As for "celebrity" doppelgangers, I think he looks like Matthew Patrick (MatPat) of Game/Film/Food Theory
his hair stayed in place the whole video, hair tutorial???? hahaha
NEVER HAVE I EVER clicked so fast lol. Thanks Stuart! Thanks Mia!
Im freakin out!!! You guysssssss looks so in love & if my guy doesnt look me like Stewart looks at Mia, im not taking it💜🥳❤️
☺️
It's soooo adorable how Stuart kept looking at Mia instead of the camera 🤧💖
Really brave of Stuart to put himself up for this! Only love 💕
he is so frickin cute🍁
So happy for you both 🥳🎉🥰 can’t wait to see more of him on the channel if he decides to. If not that’s totally okay too. I’m glad we got to at least “meet” him.
Awww yall is so good with eachother. He's a little shied but hw so nice. I'm so happy for yall I'm glad that u don't have to blurred him anymore. I want to see more of yall
Hi cool video idea 💡 What about you and your fiance build  a secret hide out (hang out ) Without your parents knowing then stay in it for 24 hours
Peanut and Stubby 😭 my heart 🥺
Oh wow you guys are so so cute together 😍
First of all you guys are sooo cute together. I had a big smile throughout the whole video!  As for your question I think Stewart ( I hope I am spelling his name right) looks like the Jack and Finn Harries when they were still on youtube together.
First Aaron and Roni getti g married then this! 🥰🥰🥰
you guys are so adorable!! thank you for being apart of Mia’s life and coming on her channel!! we appreciate you so much! they way you guys look at each other is everything 🥺🥺🥰 so beyond happy for you both ❤️
Made me smile trough the entire video. Love you sooo much guys. Happy for you ☺
omg we love fiancé Stewart <3
sending so much positive energy to you both❤❤❤❤❤
I’m so disappointed Mia didn’t add a splashing sound when they high-fived…   You guys are super adorable. I’m getting the feeling there’s some real sass hiding under those nerves, so I’m looking forward to getting to “know” Stuart a little better. Creds for stepping into the spotlight. I would have s*** my pants.
I appreciate the Mama Maples cameo so so much. Lovely video! Nice to meet you Stuart ☺️
he is whipped for mia! lol
They are literally Rapunzel and Flin Ryder!
You guys are adorable together!!!! Your both such wonderful people you deserve nothing but the best and you both seem so strong and grounded in your relationship, you will be able to overcome anything together!!!!! Im so happy for you both!!!!! ❤❤
Looking so good together!❤️
I had so much fun literally I was smiling the whole time .....thankyou so much for being comfortable with the camera and us....we really really like you...and iam happy that mia got someone like u🤗🤗🥰
This was so cute!! So happy for you guys! & can’t wait to get to know him more if he’s comfortable being in more videos :)
You guys are so cute together🥰
Oh my goodness you 2 are so sweet together! Couldn't have pictured a more perfect person for mia:)!
When I first saw Stuart I had to do a double take to make sure that wasn't matt (matpat) so I'd say his doppelganger is matt.
Welcome to the family, Stuart!!
Lots of love 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖you guys are adorable! Thank you Mia!!
Obsessed with you two!!
He is the one that u did boyfriend tag with like years ago?? I thought so maybe it was someone else.
Yay!!! Been waiting for this meeting!!
EDWARD CULLENNNNNN
OMG! Get married already! Love him, Mia! Congrats!!
He looks like Timothee Chalamet so much! I’m so happy for you guys 💕
Your fiancé is so calming! You both merge together so well!!!

What a gorgeous couple, I wish you all the happiness in the world! I am so curious to see people's opinions of which celebrity he resembles, as I am still trying to figure it out, but nobody is talking about it yet 😅.
HIS NAME IS STEWART… i love it
I am literally so happy and screamiiiiing and i’m only on minute 3
I think his celebrity look alike is Tobey Maguire!! funny though because you guys read a question over spidey😂
I couldn't stop smiling throughout all of the video!! So happy for you guys!! 😭 you two look so perfect together and, although he was pretty nervous, he managed it pretty well! 😊 Much love 💞
Nice to meet you Stuart 😊
Not only is he a total cutie, he looks at you like you're his world. So happy he agreed to be in a video! ❤
Very nice 2 meet u ur a great pair so cute......when stewart said he had a extra button indone.....he won me over very good humor well played. C u again stewart soon lovely couple💕👍🤗
Thank You for sharing yourself with us Stewart and I think you resemble Robert Pattinson a bit
8:45 I wish didn't made this association, but... your nose . Ok, I'm leaving now.
David tenant (especially as Barty crouch JR. in HP) !! Stuart looks like David tenant. Haha.  Also congrats!!!! Y’all are perfect together:)  Thanks for giving us your time Stuart!
I swear when I first saw Stewart I thought he looked like Andrew Garfield a bit
He's adorable!
I see some Dave Franco in there, not identical twins, maybe fraternal?
You are such a cute couple and he seems like a sweet guy
Your fiancé looks a lot like Gregg Sulkin, from Wizards of Waverly Place 😊
Stuart, we are so excited to meet you! You seem so sweet and caring for Mia and we would love to see you in future videos! 💙💙💙  Also, you look a bit like Andrew Garfield to me!

Match made in heaven!  Congrats on first joint video!  I think Stewart looks like young Bob Saget .
he looks a bit like Freddie Highmore, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, and someone else combined but I can't think of who! Maybe Logan Lerman? He just reminds me of a YA novel lead character
Tom holland all tge way<3

Stewart looks like the youtuber Matt patt
"trying to hide his lack of taste in music" PLS HAHAHA i get so nervous too when people wanna hear the type of music i listen to and the genre i listen to ranges dramatically from rock/punk to indie songs😭🤣
Finally!!!!!!

Two moments I enjoyed (honorable mention: Mama Mia's reaction)  2:58 - [Mia]: I wish you would take more risks. [Stuart]: More risks? This isn't risky enough? I have an extra button undone 💀   5:15 - [Question]: Who's most annoying? [Stuart]: We both just arent annoying. [Mia]: Oh Period.  ALSO, you both remind me of Bridget Mendler & Gregg Sulkin who both played characters dating Russo siblings 💀 (Vampire girlfriend & werewolf boyfriend from Wizards of Waverly Place)
Omg y'all are so cute 😭😭❤️❤️ Stewart is so genuine and kind 💕💕

Mia, I think Stewart looks similar to Bob Saget "Danny" from the Full House Era like season 6.
I’m a Pisces and my boyfriend is a Taurus 🤣 I feel like we butt heads so much. so idk if it’s a match made in heaven 😂
Hi Stewart! It was so nice to finally meet you! We are excited to see you in future videos!
Awwww omg he’s so nervous 😭 we love you Stewart we think your great!! 💕💕 thank you for going out of your comfort zone for Mia and us
Seeing you both together is so refreshing!

Omg hi! You’re adorable, I can see why you two are so good together. Welcome to the channel, don’t feel intimidated we love Mia so much and you will be so accepted. ❤️
Awww the way he looked at you Mia!! You guys are too cute! I’m so glad he agreed to do this video ❤️❤️
omg you're so perfect together!! i'm extremely happy for you both!!
Nicholas Cage pillowcase. No offense, just my first tought😂😂😂 You are veryyy brave! Thanks for showing yourself💛
You are both so cute 😍
I`m not aware of any celebrities he looks like, but I'm getting a very British vibe from him
I forgot the actor's name but he looks like the one from You/Dan Humphrey from Gossip Girl
Okay firstly this is so cute. Secondly if I hadddd to choose a celeb he looks like, I’d say if his hair was longer, maybe a bit of Finn Wolfhard.
Thank you, Stuart (Stewart?) for giving us the opportunity to know you!
Stewart is a dreamboat.
Lemme enlighten you about another whole part of astrology that is sidereal astrology, your signs are likely to be different there. And personally too the usual one said that I was a pisces but I related to absolutely nothing about a pisces and then I discovered sidereal astrology and turns out I'm actually an aquarius and trust I've never related to something as much as I related to aquarians So you should probably check it out too!
You guys are adorable! So happy for you.
Are you living together?
I don’t know WHICH celebrity he looks like, but he looks like A celebrity 😊♥️ if that makes sense
Stewart kind of reminds me of Gregg Sulkin lol! You guys are so cute together ☺️
Awesome job mia
I sware to u , he is à mixture of Andrew and Tom Holland from the Spiderman series , and he is reaaaaalay shy and cute , 😍
Y’all are so cute together. I wish y’all all of the happiness for you and Stuart.
OMG I SCREAMED AHHH
He looks like a clean shaven version of Sam claffin!!! I hope you do a part 2 of this video, if possible, please!! This was so fun to watch 🧡✨
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE I CANT HANDLE IT 💕💕
Maybe include him in some of your next try on hauls?? Matching outfits????? ❤❤
He is cute Mia and calm very gentle 🤩🤩🤩 and Mia i am a Gemini and tourist too  you sometime have both. Versatility is good for life 😜 The moment he said dress isn't purpose of marriage I was immediately convinced he is gem 💎💎💎💎 You are so lucky Mia to marry love of ur life
Mia’s music taste is spot on to mine
Match made in heaven 🧿❤️
Your guys look AMAZING together! He looks like Shawn Mendez!
He is sch a sweet and a calm person who is so appreciative of Mia, love you both together!
aww he is so cite u both are litarlly so cute together
We respect your privacy and thank you because you decided to do a video with Mia , it's mainly for her, now she can be more comfortable and won't have to be stressed not to be seen in public with you because she wants to respect your decision of staying " out of social media "
You guys are just the cutest!! Loved this!
You should do a part 2 and answer some more of the questions if you guys are up for it❤😁
Love looooove looooooooooooooove you guys, he is adorable and its sooo obvious how much he adores you
He looks a little like Matt patt
I actually thought he kinda looks like Peter Parker! A mix of the 3 actors and the What If Peter parker hahahaha
Think you're both super cute but the whole getting married in your early 20's just screams Christian value vibes and that makes me *sigh*.. The world needs more young women to live their lives a bit first before choosing to settle down into marriage. You haven't made nearly enough mistakes yet in life to know that this one specific person is for you, forever. Sure, divorce is a thing.. but there's literally no upside in 2022 to getting married in your early 20's. Women are allowed to have sex nowadays without shame. We're allowed to make mistakes and be stupid. We're allowed to live.. Think you're very pure and cute as a couple, but I hope you don't someday long for the grittier days you should be having now in the future x
Idk why but I’m like Stewart looks like he can be the next spider man. Literally has the face for it !! So handsome love y’all!!
This was so precious to watch!!! ❤️ thanks for letting us meet you and see your face, I know that took a lot! So happy for you guys 🙌🏻✨
He looks like he could be Finn and Jack Harries brother!!
I kinda see Tom holland with Stuart littles personality 😂
We Stan Stewart!!!!! 💜 love how happy you are and although he is nervous I can definitely tell your personalities match great. 💜
He looks like Gregg Sulkin (Mason from Wizards of Waverly Place)!
I think Stewart looks like Henry Cavill!
Is that a bit of an accent I detect? A French speaker perhaps? Also loved this- u did a great job Stewart! He actually does give me young Johnny Depp vibes ngl
Most beautiful couple award ❤️
Omg my first thought was: he looks just like the guy from 'you' hahah
As for Stewart’s celebrity look alike, I think he really looks like Joe from You. The outfit, the hair, the nose.
not sure if he looks like any celebrity, but honestly the both of you look like celebrities so that checks out !!!!!
His personality is so similar to my fiancé. You two are adorable!

After she anouced she's gonna show her fiance today I was waiting for this like it'll decide if I'll die or live😂😂
He's giving me Shawn Mendes vibes!
If we're talking Doppelgangers I'm thinking the vJonas Brothers, not any single one, just all of them together, I feel like Stuart is the 4th jonas brother we hear about but don't know what he looks like.
Ahhh love it, he is sooo cute, welcome to the Mia Family 🤍
He is a sweetheart and I hope you manage to keep private whatever you decide to keep private. I wish you nothing but love and happiness 🌸✨

I was way to hours late when I saw your ig story asking for questions (blaming it to time zones). Was hoping to ask your fiance this: Did you watch Mia's video about your engagement? What was your reaction when you learned that Mia had a crush to you before? Did you also notice Mia that time?
Love this
