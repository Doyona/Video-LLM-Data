It is stigmatized.  It isnt so understood. I feel like a freak sometimes n its hard to tell others without feeling judged
自分も不安障害です  日本の芸能界のおかげで才能が死にました
I am surprised that Kendall thinks anxiety is a "beautiful thing." What an incongrous statement to make when this can make you think you need to go to the hospital! If it's so "beautiful," then why talk to Dr. Ramani?
Gross. Idc about her. She has the $ for proper treatment. So many others in the US don't. I'd rather you help the people who can't afford care, than an elite.
I don't know if she was traumatized as a child or maybe assaulted. We literally don't know what goes behind the camera. But I feel like she must have childhood trauma, that has caused anxiety. It is, in my case
Thank you Kendall !!
I want my life to be narrated by Dr Ramani.  Her voice is so soothing and she’s brilliant.

Poor little rich white girl! What is she anxious about? Not having enough organic quinoa or her favorite Gucci bag being sold out? Cut the bs.

dont worry
Wow, I really love this interview. It’s true what all humans have is that we are all equal in that aspect. We all deal with fifteenth emotions are are a lot alike. Thank you, for bringing awareness that celebrities or wealthy people still have struggles.
She’s not a celebrity, so why are you interviewing her? Why not talk about people that are artistic for people that are interesting I don’t wanna hear about people who have 15 minutes of fame. I want to talk about real celebrities people with serious talent who have unique qualities she’s just another person with anxiety. It’s not anybody who’s influencing anybody and either of you you’re not influencing anyone doctor you’re boring you have 15 minutes of fame and it’s almost up.
Thank you a million times ❤ What if you're Narcicist has used your advice on me?????? No,  i am not the Narcicist!!!!
I love Kendal so much! Been dealing with anxiety since October 20204 😢.  Hearing her talk about it makes me feel not alone anymore
In one of her videos ramani mentioned and admitted  that Clinical psychologists also falls into the catergory of narrcassitic spectrum. So is this interview about a narcassist interviewing a celebrity narcassist.
I love this video it relates to me a lot thank you vogue for this helpful video so people who dont know anxiety can understand
República Popular China
Why are you talking to a young privileged wealthy famous person instead of someone who isn’t?   She has the money to see a therapist any therapist but yet she does this like she and her family does to be on TV   She could talk to Dr Ramani privately but no she has to talk in front of the camera so millions can watch her to feed her endless ego  No sympathy.
Hormones can cause anxiety. Since my estrogen dropped my anxiety ramped up so bad until I got on estradiol patch helped me so much! My mind raced awfully before that
This is the best and so meaningful video I had seen so far on YouTube. So relatable
❤
I am talking about fellings.
You are so beautiful ladies... you are helping this world to be a better place
What IS anxiety?
I feel this as a new nurse. I feel like I have a responsibility to be personable and patient focused and confident in my role, but I’m so scared and anxious every day that my normally friendly and bubbly personality is kind of stifled. I don’t even feel like myself because I’m trying so hard to just not panic I can’t at all be comfortable and confident.
Yep that it ! PTSD with panic attacks 🙏
Thank you for sharing this ! Anxiety can feel like a never-ending battle, but there are powerful ways to reset your mind and body. I’ve helped people break free using unique healing methods that go beyond the usual advice. If you’re struggling, you’re not alone—there’s a way forward!💙
The kardashians are so abused in the world by hateful people. me personally I don’t have a bad feeling about them as people say they’re dumb, rich, no talent etc, it’s not my business? It’s their life ? They haven’t done anything to me so why would I have a problem with them? People are hating because they hate themselves
They look like mother and daughter
Her family is narcissistic she could have ptsd
Anxiety means you’re normal. Look at the world.
Ms Kendal is you are authentic and stunningly beautiful
😊
I dont carego to a Diddy party ro relax...
My anxiety used to present with a fight or flight sensation with the urge to need to go to the bathroom. At 40, the presentation changed, and got 100x worse. I now get horrible palpitations and start hyperventilating. So bad that I have called the ambulance multiple times. It's destructive. I hate it.
I loved this discussion and Kendall did a great job in bringing more awareness to this issue. For me it's the worst at night. It starts slowly without me even realising it, then suddenly it's 1 am and i'm still wide awake, the only difference between then and now being that my heart rate is much faster and i feel like i can't breathe. My anxiety manifests as this persistent, excessive worry something bad happening in the future with thoughts like, 'they hate you' 'you did something wrong and the consequence of it is going to be that they will reject you' as if I even care what they think of me when in reality I don't. I hate it because it's so irrational and yet it feels so real in the moment that I believe in it. Especially when I have gone through traumatic childhood experience, I think it's my brain linking it to my past and feeling as though things are going to happen the same way it did before. The future has not unfolded yet, there are so many possibilities yet my brain chooses to focus on the worst outcome.
Expectations usually makes us feel that way.
It's definitely not a pitty party talking about these struggles. That stigma needs to go.
Somewhat confusing. As an empath, I choose to be silent and not engage with toxic conversations.
Practice vipassana and all these things will go away — learn to observe and not react to your sensations.
IRRELEVANT
maybe leaving the cult would lower her anxiety....
Did you guys miss Dr. Ramani's introduction on purpose?
Naveen Menon at Cisco is a Narc
Thank you for sharing 😊
❤ thank you so much  I live with anxiety and I am managing well ❤️‍🩹
I find it absolutely hilarious that a phycologist specializing in narcissism is interviewing one of the biggest narcissists on the planet talking about anxiety.  Everyone has anxiety..,.
I love you both😊
mac
stuff
🎉
🤍😍👸🏻
Ugh she is mee.
Oh, so now she knows what anxiety is, thanks for educating us and our ignorant. WOW, you’re dealing with so much. If it wasn’t for you, I wouldn’t be aware. This is insignificant because we don’t even question if she hasn’t gotten enough in the media. BS
The most likable Kardashian I've seen.
I have a crush on ariana grande
Love you Kendall 🤍
I can definitely relate to Kendall! I have terrible anxiety! Social anxiety and I'm an introvert on top of that 😮
THANK YOU!!! ❤
Explaining anxiety disorders don't help finding the real causes. The appropriate questions to ask herself would be : whose anxiety disorder I may carry, thinking this is truly mine ? What are the secondary benefits I get being anxious ? What am I afraid of loosing if I shall let my anxiety goes ?  ...
I’m SAD.
I have had anxiety i didnt knew at first if it was there i wasnt trying to figure out what was wrong but i had stomach issues rapid heart beat almost like sweaty whenever a social situation would come up i would go blank but i didnt knew if it needed help but then i went to psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with social anxiety now i get it i get what i feel i think knowing what you are going through is really important so then you can do stuff that helps you ease that
❤
Si tu avais un mec tu serais moins anxieuse déjà🤪🤪🤪🤪🙊🙊🙊🙊
How Dr Ramani pass by her Narcissism being this her speciality…
Believe it or not, us extroverted folks have MASSIVE anxiety. If we feel rejected we will literally end a conversation and feel bad because we don't want to make anyone dusgusted by our presence. We literally try to social to MASK the anxiety!  Even extroverts have to mentally prepare to socialize! DONT BE DECEIVED ❤
I'm not usually a fan of the Kardashians, but Kendall being authentic and open about this is refreshing.
How can victims of family court expose
"I have anxiety because I know there are other girls hotter and more interesting than me" just say that kendull
stuck childhood trauma
I would be also anxious all the time if I would have grown up in that family…
Our parents when they hury us used those words.
Nick names
Kendall is just lazy
Why is doctorramani now at vogue 😤
This is a disorder that unless you have it is complicated to understand. Coupe years ago before I started experience my own symptoms, when my friends would tell their experiences I was ignorant to think they were exaggerating. Now on medication and weekly therapy… Holly s* I’m tired
I don’t like Kendall sometimes but the way she explained her anxiety is so real.
If this person who has access to the best medical care, medications, therapy and everything else still has anxiety and problems like this, I have no hope. None.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 pa ya sa
I like this woman..❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wonder what Ramani thought regarding who may be narcissistic in her life
She's very refreshing as far as that family is concerned.
OMG, what the f is this. How about living a normal life. Could that be something?
kendall Jenner is tall and beautiful brunette
Wow she is the prettiest and most real of the clan. She seems so sweet.
Laughable
Kendall has Trypophobia. That’s a serious condition. I believe it’s externalised hypochondria. Toxic powerlessness and shame.
A narcissistic self-promotion. It shouldn't be on this channel...
She's such an icon. LOVE you Kendall! 🌹🌹❤️❤️
Kendal is heading towards a spontaneous Kundalini Awakening
It's mold toxicity.
I wonder how much toxic mold plays a part in all of this.
Thank you Dr. Ramani and Kendall for sharing this session.💞
Dr Ramani is so blessed. She deserves all the recognition!
Poor Kendall. LIFE IS SO DIFFICULT.
thank you. my son deals with all of this. Im going to share it with him. thanks Dr Ramani and kendall
🇺🇸Kendall Nicole Jenner and  818 tequila and 🇯🇵Izumi Jenner👶🍼👩‍🍼👨‍🍼🦮🐴👋👋👏👏✌️✌️👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☮️🌏🌎🌍🇺🇳🇪🇺👋👋✌️✌️👍👍
Mine is chronic and debilitating but I’m a lot older, poorer and unsupported than Ms Jenner so I can’t relate to her whatsoever
TWO OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙌🏼💕
They both look like narcissists ngl… like they wanna talk over each other and wanna dominate the conversation. The body language and facial expressions are just suspicious.
At 7:03, I truly believe that the therapist means well when she says practice talking about your anxiety with your nearest and dearest, but this can be the worst tactic for some people. My family is awesome but they do not understand what I go through with anxiety. Please speak directly to a professional in order to get the care that you need. Do not downplay it.
Love you Kendall, thank you so much for that ❤
Oh Lord she's in, or been co+oped, with the archetypal nasties of the machine. Like Oprah. Poor dear but I'm outa here lol
People like Kendal can get every support  But we are normal people struggling a lot
It feels so physical but its not 😭
Wonderful interview! Congrats Doctor Ramani ❤
I know exactly what this means, I live with chronic anxiety 💭
Some fans of Kendall may be just getting to know Dr Ramani and myself a fan of Dr Ramani getting to know Kendall 😅❤
Of course you’re a human person. You have no control of who you are and how you were born. Keep trying to heal and your so beautiful
she's so genuine
my favorite sessions. honestly as someone who has not a lot of people to talk to about my anxiety, these videos are a lifesaver
Unself actualized  Call upon the Savior But, it's real, and the truth of the Savior is actually self actualized.
Cant stand this idiot family. Stop promoting these people 🙄
You’re interviewing a narcissist, I don’t get it…
I feel like her. Omg. It's horrible. Narsacistic abuse is my issue & poor. It's the stress & the pressure cameras on her allot. She is probably one of the nicest of that family. Yes cuz pandemic then her just worse added by slum lord.
No MERCY 🎉
I’m back having anxiety knowing it’s anxiety but it’s still scary and hard
🤍🤍
Kinda makes me trust you less as a psych Dr seeing u shill for this type of monster. Ooff
omg... I don't even know what to think anymore.
Dr.Ramani is a real Treasure 🕊️❤️🙏
Go get a massage. Take the rest of your life off...as a mental health day. Rich people annoy me. Real people miss out on meals and water bills if they can't leave the house 😡
As someone who’s dealt with anxiety my whole life…adding magnesium and l-theanine into my diet is a LIFE CHANGER!!!!!
What is your husband's name?
Why aren't they talking about narcissim?!;)
That whole family are narcissists
I came for Dr Ramani 😊😊😊😊
I hope our judgmental and critical society on mental health can shift to empathy, care, and holistic communities!
Start with closing your shirt, Kendall.  No one wants to see your chest.
I feel other peoples emotions….all,the time….and that is stressful
The feeling of dieing as your anxiety is in high gear is a terrifying experience
thank you
Well, when your…er…other mother (?), starts putting on a dress and competing with you for glamor….it’s got to leave some sort of mark. How do you come to terms with something like that, as a child, let alone as an adult? 🤔😕
I love Kendall Jenner. She's beautiful and that interview revealed that a person who seemingly has it all can still long for normalcy! Wish her well! ❤
Is that the muffin mans wife???
❤❤❤ Dr. Ramani ❤❤❤
Watching this while having an anxiety attack
it's so important to talk about this, kendall reminding me i'm not alone with my mental illness.❤
Thank you Dr. Ramani and Kendall for sharing this. It is helping so much!
Dr. Ramani is such a blessing to the world of psychology. Didn't know she sat with Kendall Jenner and I didn't know Kendall was having these issues. It's a new way of looking at celebrities instead of just all glitz and glam.
Thank you for this insightful video, Vogue! It's incredibly brave of Kendall Jenner to open up about her personal struggles with anxiety. Her honesty and vulnerability are truly commendable, and it helps break down the stigma surrounding mental health issues. It's crucial to remember that even those in the public eye face their own battles behind the scenes. Kendall's willingness to share her story provides comfort and reassurance to countless others who may be going through similar experiences. Let's continue to foster a compassionate and understanding environment where discussions about mental health are encouraged and supported. Kudos to Kendall and Vogue for shedding light on such an important topic.
i knew there was something going on with her because shes always just be like very very reserved on the shows and then once in a while you see her get angry.  i always wondered what was up with her.
Thank you, Dr. Ramani and Kendall Jenner. I have an anxiety disorder. So this has helped me feel better about my conditions. This is great information. 💯👍🏻🦋🌏🔉🔉🔉🔉
Every phrase sounds like a question...this weird generation.
Dr. Ramani is The Very Best! Thank you for opening up about your mental health struggles, Kendall!💕
Ive never been into the Kardashans...actually I avoid this kind of TV/media ; I loathe it. Watching this; I see a very intelligent, self aware, sound judging , young woman, I ''m a bit stressed about how fast Dr.Ramani speaks; proving she's nervous due to the person she's in front of. I accept it, cause it proves Dr.Ramani is also a human; but I hope it's not for the money.
Dr. Ramani, for someone who calls out narcissism, why don’t you call out the Kardashian/Jenner’s? I think it’s not fair they get a pass when they are so obviously narcissistic including Kendall.
It strikes me that Dr Ramani built a whole career about narcissism yet she here she is giving another narcissist the satisfying feeling she needed 😳
Great Interview..and, what a beautiful view
This is a video for those people who think that she is a mean girl. She ain't a mean girl at all, she struggles with anxiety and we love her😍😍😍😍😍😍
Poor spoiled narcissist
Yes everything little thing that happens gets amplified in your head its really hard because your actually scared
Is that why she’s a terrible role model for youth?
She expresses herself well.
When you meditate you can see your thoughts and be aware of them to then change them.
Anxiety is actually rooted in weak adrenal glands caused by stress of any nature whether that’s trauma, poor diet/lifestyle (coffee is a big one, sugar with the  exception of fruit, dairy, bad oils, soy, gluten, and anything processed), going to be late, drugs (including medication) alcohol, overwork, not listening to your soul purpose,  and list goes on. It is a weak adrenal response which impacts the body/mind, not exactly a ‘mind disorder’. Medical/psych field has a lot of catching up to do.
This exactly what it feels like for me
Thank you!!!
Just because someone is a celebrity  doesn't mean they can't be anxious . If anything, they have even more reason to be anxious. Being in the spotlight especially as a woman puts them in even more danger. People become obsessed and obsession can be dangerous or even deadly. It's not fair that people say things like "oh what do you have to be anxious about".
Thank you Kendall, for sharing your story.
Yeah getting real tired of YouTube and all these repetitive ads got to find something else to start watching YouTube's nothing but adds
What about the gut connection?
Kendall, WHY have this horrible negative woman on your channel. ???? She is dangerous. Researcy...
Dr Ramani is the best thing on the internet.
Inch by inch
Ok
High light ( mod)
Omuguhhh - Dr. Ramni is legendary - 🏆
I feel her. My anxiety is through the roof and most times I feel like I’m dying. Status in life has nothing to do with mental wellbeing!!
Psychological Ben's...huh. yeah I'm a diver..and then some..
Kendall is beautiful
I’m glad she shared this , anxiety and panic attacks are something that people don’t take seriously…. But it is very serious
I love watching and admire Dr. Ramani. But who is Kendall🤔
Is there a way to contact her ? The doctor
What a sweetheart!
I hate women that talk like everything they say it is a question
I wonder if Kendall has anyone that she can actually trust.
Ramani has such a sweet way to tell us anxiety can be our friend
Ha-ha! Kendall Narcissistically put Rambling Ramani in her place!!
Ok is it just me or is "Dr Ramani" the classic Narcissist??    too funny...they can't recognize it.     Licensed Clinical Psychologist in big letters...dead give away. Look at me I'm better than you
I'm getting her a Valentine's for Xmas
I took me a year to build courage to watch this video THANK YOU SO MUCH KENDALL❤❤❤
Is it me or do you two look alike..?
My two cents in.....Jenner said that she spends lots of time with people. That in itself, any gentle person around people, crowds excessively gets some of their 'madness', she is absorbing their problems. You need some 'me' time. You are lovely, you deserve it. Thanks for being open about it.
Watch her- watch how she maintains steady eye contact ,not shy at all. Listen- hypochondriac - I think she has Generalised not Social
OMG!! Exactly what I feel !!
She is having anxiety attacks.  Ugh. They're awful!!
Doctor Ramani has mastered her soothing voice like I feel so calm and safe hearing her talk.
I wonder if she'll seek treatment for narcissism, too?
Wow, Dr. R, of all the vids I’ve seen you do this brought tears to my eyes. Not sure why. Maybe it’s that being a fly OTW that let me peek into you in the hot seat. Thanks again 😊
Did anyone noticed how Ramani was noticing Kendalls reactions and her body language
Can she say 1 single sentence without multiple “likes”…just shows classlessness
Interestingly a narssist psychologist talks with someone so caught up in that and psychologist conveniently ignores it.  Not saying Kendle doesn't have anxiety but this whole thing was SO fake. Quickly becoming the celebrity psychologist?
Ramani, I had no idea you've been in the celebrity circuit.
Dr. Ramani is the best!
I’ve been watching and relaxing to @cookiesandcalm videos.  https://youtube.com/@cookiesandcalm
I highly recommend: 》》》Dream Lover Nature Therapy... i hope this can help you to cope with anxiety!
At the end of the day $$ does not equal to happiness.. she is just a normal human being after all.. just a personal opinion ..
IV always loved her the most because she was so quite and different  but just stunning
❤ I feel heard❤ thank you .
https://youtu.be/lnitsAD-Thk
Love this 😀
Is the anxiety caused by growing up in the paparazzi's eye?
Sobbing. Everyone with anxiety knows people like to say "it's in your head" but when they have no idea what you're going through, that's just dismissive (or so it seems). Having someone validate your flawed system of protecting yourself and supporting you through then learning process is like the hug i needed when i was little but didn't get. Thanks. k bye
Having a skunk stripe doesn't make one Mrs. Patton, and selling a single lipstick doesn't make one a billionaire.
Kendal is a sweetie ❤ for writing down the questions of her followers and viewers to ask the therapist , because there is many people that cant afford therapy so bless her heart ❤️
I'm so proud of her. It's not easy to talk about these  things.
Kid you get panic attacks Ativan,😊
"You know"
I love these ladies! Dr Ramani saved my life.❤
She looks de@d behind the eyes
Well she sure wasn't "attuned to other people's anxiety" when she did that Coke add mocking BLM.  Maybe the backlash of that might have made her become more attuned? 🤷‍♀️
So you would think that someone like you would not be a mean girl. It was disappointing to see you be mean
Dr Rom I just want to say thank you for the gift you are for humanity
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
This family K and J family are witches.
As much as i appreciate kendall and her story, she always uses my disorder (ocd) as an adjective 😩
Hi Moma k
id rather see her help regular people with regular problems
Oh please...
Thanks that's really helpful.......it's so severe it's awful
Doesn't explain why she needs to park in handicapped spots
I’m part of the 10% who came here for Dr ramani 😭😂💕 and this was great im so glad they did this
i dont like you fake eye lashes ramani
She’s a narcissist, so it’s ironic for thos to be on your channel.
It’s not just anxiety about something, sometimes it just happens
She mentioned numbness as a symptom and Im so glad- I have an anxiety disorder (diagnosed) and I rarely hear people mention this symptom as it can/is a daily physical disability.
How can she have an anxiety? She's rich,beautiful. She  was just making up a story for attention
Awesome video! So happy it's been created, very much needed in today's world.
I love this ❤
Thank you. you understand
As much as I do empathise with Kendall's story and as someone with diagnosed social anxiety disorder, I have to say its about time she owned up, held herself and her family accountable for the crippling beauty standards and body image they have set on impressionable, young people. Without doing so, it would seem a tad bit hypocritical to address pertinent anxiety issues plaguing our generation. The larger context of young adult mental health issues in the 21st century is much more structural and dynamic, in that sense.
Thank you Kendall and hope her all the best ❤
Such a great series, more like this please!
Her being famous is an advantage and a disadvantage as well... 😅😅... But as she has her loved ones. No worries ❤️😊
Ramped up
And I was counting how many times Kendall used "Like" after 57 I'm done 🥱🥱😴
I absolutely LOVE that she is humble and self aware.  💗
Thank you for this
Kendall idungnya tambah mancung be dah
Typically kardashian. Plus their doc made them look alike each other.
This made me feel so much better about myself, the relatable part Kendall described is exactly how I feel. Sometimes I think I’m crazy until I see that others are just like me.
It's soothing to listen to her. When you listen to someone who has the same issue as you. You feel empowered and you're not alone to feel that way.
That psychologist was on LAHWF Chatting With, now look at her
Poor her. She has spotlight that make her feel overwhelming
What a wonderful video!, thank you Dr Ramani and Miss Kendall. It’s amazing how well balanced and poised you are. Despite your astounding beauty, your true beauty is your courage to do this. God bless you both!! Thank you 🙏 again
She is going  to get paid  so much ...for nothing  I wanna  do that...
Congratulations on the interview, Dr Ramani!
Congrats on the interview, Dr Ramani!
Highly aware of surroundings
Super empathic
High alert
Hyper awareness
me, alien here. i don like postmodern private intimate stories going public. thats bad darvasula braman. the kendal here, i have no time for this, except, anxiety i can trust, all other emotions etc. are constructs, not in the real real is, you know, what blur the reality as it escapes symbolization
can you do one video with Dyslexia
Anxiety can be terrifyingly debilitating... It can make you vomit and my IBS is connected to it.  Its really scary.  We used isolation as an excuse to hide away and let the anxiety box us into our houses so we've grown comfortable in the house.
Anxiety is very challenging I can understand how much pressure must exist in a family like hers, in essence to succeed and be perfect.  I've had severe panic attacks and my life is very fortunate.
thanks
Kendall you’re so beautiful 😍
Kendall your not the only one with anxiety
Loved this! Very relatable
Kendall is one of my favorite Kardashians. She doesn’t seem superficial and she was so upfront saying her life is sort of privileged.
Anyone else notice how Jenner tries to control the conversation and come off as "the expert"?
Bahaha… umm🧐
Kendall truly got the best of both of her parents looks. Hit the jackpot!
I LOVE Dr. Ramani. Best person in the world for Kendall to talk with about her anxiety.
Kendall is gorgeous.  Hard for anyone to dispute that.
WHAT OPEN-MINDED REALLY IS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DlufWQ9XaY
Stop  COVID to criticize negative is choice to keep personality mine not ur disorder to title.
Cause of negative to have personality Absolutely my Correct..grade my mistakes to temper heat is WTH
numinosum
I've always liked Kendall, even if I know only a little about her. I love her vibe and feel like she's the most relatable out of all of her siblings
Sufferring in front of other people brings more anxiety, so if i was famous and sufferring with anxiety i would simply disapear, i couldnt live like this. I dont know how they manage to live in this toxic world, having bad anxiety and depression myself i always think how hard this should be for someone who are being constantly being judged. I would probably tell all of them to just leave this life, peace of mind its better than fame and fortune.
For some reason it kind of irks me that this is by Vogue, like mental health but make it ‘fashunnnn’
Dr.Ramini is truly inspiring and beautiful blessing 💜✨ Grateful to u for sharing ur story Kendall.... God bless u all...Thanks Dr. Ramini u are beautiful inside out....
10:44
10:45
Kim who?
I relate to this so much.
I admire Kendall, she’s my favourite out of all her sisters. Very honest, open and has a natural beauty inside & out. I hope she never gets any cosmetic stuff done because she is absolutely gorgeous just the way she is. Go Kendall, shove those anxieties away, keep smiling, blessings and positive energy to you 💜
Oh my God Dr. Ramani! Love it!. Kendall you’re beautiful!
Plot twisted. This is kendalls actual mom
I love Dr. Ramani. Weird if a fan girl over her vs. Kendall or nah?
Disliked because of that irritating psychologist
Thank you Kenny! I can relate and loved this!
I love Dr Ramani❤️ She is so supportive
I liked when the therapist pointed out how Kendal made her feel comfortable and welcome by opening her body language and not being aloof. For me it’s a really nice quality in someone who is anxious but really doesn’t want others to feel that way and goes out of her way to be welcoming. She seems like a genuinely nice person tbh
OMG Kendall now I love you even more! I completely understand everything you feel, and the hypocondriac feeling is completely true, when I started with anxiety I used to run to the hospital thinking there was something wrong with my body and that I was going to die. After watching this video I feel understood, thank you.
To comment on the sanitizer and mask wearing….we also forget that both sides have a right to their own position on it. There is overkill on both sides. Just as the non mask wearers and sanitizer users can instill anxiety in those who are thinking that’s the only way….the other side is this: the mask wearing and over sanitizing can not only cause major health issues, but can also instill anxiety in those that don’t want that to be a focus of living life.   We forget there are TWO sides to everything. Not just one that is the “ right”side.
The doctor herself is nervous and has anxiety, notice her big body movements and sitting forward… whilst Kendal is happy calm and relaxed sitting back ….
I can so relate to all of this
I can really relate to her
Awwwwww, I’m so anxious…should I go shopping at Gucci or Chanel?? Poor thing! 😒
Thanks Kendall and Dr. Ramani.
Never invalidate her just because she's Kendall Jenner. Anyone can have mental illnesses regardless of their life status.  Miss USA 2020 was known in pageant community as outspoken and smart woman but sadly she committed suicide.
I know exactly how it feels. It’s terrifying. And as I get older my anxiety has manifested into nocturnal panic attacks so I’ll wake up abruptly dizzy with my heart pounding. I’ve learned to accept it and if/when it does happen just talk to myself “it’s ok, you’re fine”
Therapist like this is why we need safe spaces in colleges now….
Ironically ❤️their view can heal anxiety ☯️💙
Give me a break, I have 6 kids, two are infant twins... You don't know what anxiety is Kendall, come live my life for a day...learn how to cut a cucumber
I see this in various examples today! 4:30 and not many understand that this is happening. We all have to step it up and be able to take a minute to understand
Give me a break
It feels physically messed up..
Please don't feel anxious
Germany will stay in isolation
Anxiety= See Germany ☺️☺️☺️☺️
I know exactly what that feeling is. Dealing w panic disorder for 6 yrs and it’s been HARD but I’m still here.
This was a great segment for Vogue to invest in and put out there! Bravo, and thank you. 👏
*_birds of a feather flock together_*
How brave... of Kendall to do this :) I went on the hiding for a few years... If it wasn't for the normalization of it I don't know where I would be. And yes some people downplay it and that is okayish but sometimes makes the people who really struggle with it, feel weird again. Thank you, Kendall!
In you did not live in the Jenner family, had a regular 8-5 job basically living an average life do you think you would have anxiety? I know living in your family with every day drama would give md anxiety for sure.  Not saying to leave your family of course but maybe take longer vacations or live some where different.  Get out of the spot light for a while, be normal you know what I mean?  I hope you the best
I clearly saw surprised kendall when doctor spitted the exact same situation one suffers during anxiety. Of course , if one is getting therapy it's like that 🙂
I wish Kendall was allowed to speak more in the communication with the therapist. The therapist seems more inclined to explain her ideas than listen.
I think the pandemic changed our lives in a lot of ways. But I hear a lot of people  having some problems going back to be social again.
Selena Gomez would have been so much better for this. Kendall is so closed off. The vibe just ain't it. Dr. Romani is absolutely incredible and has so much knowledge. The reciprocation was not it.
That intro was anxiety inducing
It’s called Empathy.. you just can’t dance around the spiritual aspect of these feelings and emotions. She picks up on everyone else’s energy…
Jesus bless!❤
This is exactly what happens to me 😩
Honestly knowing that someone like Kendall has this too is improving my life. It's something that I I have also struggled with this for so long and felt like a freak this whole time. People would always comment on how quiet I was or that I seemed uncomfortable and that I should just be myself. Like thanks for the advise, I am TRYING... Honestly this helps me accept myself so much more. I know nobody else that has it except my ex boyfriend and even he would sometimes say that I was "odd". And my brother is the most social butterfly that has ever lived I mean Im happy for him but also I get compared obviously.. Now I know that I'm not weird, I'm just like Kendall and probably a million other really cool people that suffer in silence. I would also never have guessed that she has it, she seems so cool.
DR.RAMANI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Oh, Dr. Ramani! Please don't say that anxiety is a GOOD thing just because you're speaking to a celebrity. I've had the privilege of speaking with many well-known people, I have ZERO psychologicial or psychiatric professional experience, but you can abandon your beliefs/theories/ knowings, just because you've interviewed a "celebrity."
Love her for this
Dr Ramani knows she is an actor. This is fake.
the modeling industry suddenly started to care about the emotions of broads, I guess
I lost a lot of respect for dr Ramani after watching her take part in this Hollywood project with Kendal. I mean I am all for helping Kendal if that’s what she wants but making this video for everyone is complicity.
Kendal seems to not get the point that it starts in the mind but the physical consequences are real and serious nonetheless. She is not wrong to think she should check her heart if her chest keeps hurting due to anxiety. Stress and anxiety  can cause serious physical conditions and can kill you.
Practicing slow deep breathing exercises can help with anxiety it has helped me tremendously, consistency is key. Everyday set out 15-30 minutes to just breathe. No woo woo esoteric breathing just normal deep breathes without any mental exercises, just breathe in and hold for 8-10 seconds and then exhale very slowly, slower is better, more of the parasympathetic nervous system is activated causing you to relax. Repeat for 15-30 minutes. Patience and discipline is required. CAUTION I do not recommend any fast paced breathing exercises like Whim Hoff's method, those can cause altered states and cause your nervous system to become excited instead of relaxed.
Wow Ramani I didn’t know you did this! You’re the best! Congratulations on all this success!
I’m very anxious and I love the way Kendall describes how not only it can be challenging just to have it, but to open up about it while being in the public eye is probably a whole different vibe.
you could have all the resources of the world and still not feel good about yourself. mental illness just like any other illness is a universal thing.
I always felt like she was different than the other sisters.  Something about her that seems authentic
Life is one anxiety attack after another until your fertilizer
I was watching your body language Doc you were feeling insecure wanted to seek more attn....Was it because that younger person in front of you ? don't worry you are more beautiful than her......
If your focus is more on society and external environments including family/extended family and friends.... the chances are that you'll end with up social anxiety. By all means, pay attention to those around you and society... as long as the balance tips in your favour! Your life.... you are the most important person!
Would love to see a sharing of mental struggles - talk between Selena and Dr Ramani too! 💗
Dr. Ramani has REALLY GREAT Youtube videos on narcissists.
Perfect chance to discuss her narcissism missed 🤣🤣
Poor rich privileged girl.
Awh baby soon we can be there for u we all sweet and kind
Baby we here for u we love u
Awh she said blessed
Wow
Does she have a narcissistic parent?
Where is SESSION 2?
The Kardashian women are witches.
Erythrophobia - it would be good to see more information on this phobia
Would love to meet her
Escuchaste mi nueva música para Atraer el Amor? ❤️
she has anxiety and sleeps paralysis, I also have it and it's hard... people hate on her so much so it must be even harder + she is constantly working with other people wow I feel so sorry for her
My daughter is very introverted and shy. I feel for her. People think she is rude when she doesn't speak to them. She was get so anxious and start to peel away between her fingers and nail biting. It should be recognised as a clinical condtion. It's often brushed over. She loved lock down because she didn't have to interact. Panic attacks are crippling as well. Well done to this young lady. ( Funny my daughter looks like her but wish she can become a bit more confident- she got her heart broken and revert back into her shell.)
i have social anxiety. especially with people that aren't in my close circle. when my ex and i were dating i was very reserved with his family and friends. and it was because of my extreme social anxiety. he never cared to understand me because he is so extroverted and a people person. It really sucked because I strongly believe he broke up with me because this was a huge issue for him since his family and friends are very important to him. I feel like his family didn't like me because of how i would act, although they never took the time to truly understand me. it really sucks. (i have only been in one relationship as a 26 y.o.)  i hope that my next relationship, is with someone that understands and acknowledges mental health
“Yeah yeah” “right” — this was very distracting
I honestly would hate to be famous to the point where anyone in the world could recognize you. I could tell she was a bit anxious in the interview but she did great and probably helped a lot of people by being brave enough to talk about her issues.
oh wow I do relate
Next..
Help me. No one believes my abuse.
Dr.Ramani I am feeling proud of you😊
"uncomfortable"...that's..uh...quite the understatement..but yeah, that aside, anxiety means your system went haywire and needs recalibration. CBT, medication (if needed) and guided exposure therapy can really help you reset. Panic disorder is literally the only mental health disorder that we have a cure for and people should be made aware of that in these discussions.
Speaking over dr is annoying sorry felt like sharing my thoughts ..
Help
When a social anxiety person mets a narcissist... That's a challenge that unless ur very very strong is  unbearable...
Thank you for this calming info about anxiety, which I have severely.
What a lovely well spoken young woman.

Of all the Kardashian/Jenner woman Kendal has the most class.
I struggle with anxiety. And when doctor Ramani said people who tend to struggle with anxiety are people who are in tuned. Who are more aware and notice. I felt it. And it was my first time accepting anxiety as a normal and kind of out of my control thing. In the sense that it's not a weakness. It's not because of me. It has an explanation that is not bad.   And it is true for me. I can walk into a room and sense a mood right away. I read people's body languages and hear their words in a different way. Most call it emotional intelligence. My therapist kind of threw it out there that as intelligent people we tend to suffer a little bit more because we are more aware. It was my first time hearing someone say I'm intelligent. It changed my life. I also came across a video on this channel that spoke about truth seeing people. And you mentioned we also tend to struggle with anxiety. It is hard when you see things that others do not see. Your voice is silenced. You are gaslight. It's heartbreaking to think one has to suffer so much for something that is a blessing. But after this video. I embrace my anxiety. So proud of Kendall. Always been a huge fan. And love love love Dr Ramani.
Besides the scientific and psychological side of this anxiety thing, there is ALSO a spiritual side to it, that I wish more people would acknowledge. The spiritual world is REAL. Demonic influence is REAL. If people don't want to believe it's real, just look up the HUNDREDS of testimonies about how people were finally freed and healed of mental illnesses when they turned to GOD for help.
Ugh 😑
I may be the only person on the planet who knew the name, but did not know who she was. This is my first time seeing her, and hearing her speak, and she seems like a very lovely intelligent caring empathic GENUINE person 😊💚
I mean she's a Kardashian,being born into that circus of narcissists  is enough to push anyone over the edge.
She looks so much like Kim. She’s gorgeous and I appreciate her courage to open up about mental health
Oh my... I am so happy I stop to listen to this.... This is all me.  Thank you for sharing.
I don't follow the Kardashians and Jenner's. But I must say Kendall seems very genuine. I feel for her because I know people with anxiety and it's a struggle!!!
I hope Pete Davidson or Madison Beer would sit down and talk with her, further helping eradicate stigma with mental illness! it would be incredibleeee
That opening gave me anxiety o.o
"I'm bad at putting my thoughts into words"
Kendall keeps talking over THE EXPERT.   TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.
You are a lovly young ladies,,and your little girl is so cute....
I love,,dr R....she's helped me soooo much...
I was having panic attacks. Going to the hospital 3x a week. A doctor told me to take 900 mg a day of high grade fish oil. He recorded Carlson brand. Also get the lemon galore. Take a tablespoon in the morning with some protein & at night also with protein. It works. Never had to go to hospital since, 6 yrs. Hope this helps
Thank you Dr. Ramani 🙏🏾
More than half of the comments are bots fyi btw... sic and twisted
Melody for anxiety https://youtu.be/jBEjbJJWqpE 😍😍
Wait is that dr. Ramani
Anxiety doesn’t discriminate it doesn’t matter how rich or poor u are. It has nothing to do with how good your life is.
kendall jenner thank you
what does axyty means?
Thankyou so much for sharing. Suffering really bad with anxiety at the moment, scared the feelings won’t go but trying my best, mind over matter, but it’s hard sometimes.
i was shook when she brought up having shortness of breath as a kid bc i’ve dealt with that since childhood too:( it was to the point where my family took me to the doctor and i got tested for asthma LOL they even gave me an inhaler 😭 now that i’m grown i realize my lungs were fine, it was all in my brain 🥲
Oh please
This was really good. I appreciate Kendal Jenner shedding light and being open/vulnerable
Dr rom is a God mother,bless and thank you
Organic Surroundings.
This was such a tell!  I'm a hypochondriac AND I think someone else in my family isn't being CAUTIOUS about COVID!  😒  Maybe the problem lies with you Kendall.
Hi guys do you mind to donate 5$ (paypal) for building my own Mental Health community🙏 i really need your help guys♥️🙏
As if the kardashians aren’t narcissists. What is Ramani doing?
I’ve come to realize that smart people experience anxiety and depression. We are just so aware and overthink about everything that is happening around us and probably see more than we want to that other people can’t seem to comprehend. They say ignorance is bliss but I would rather feel everything than to feel nothing. Anxiety relates to the future and depression is linked to the past. Find your balance of the now. ❤️
Are we witnessing Dr Ramini interviewing a charming covert narcissist? I think so.
If only people had the answer that answer us Jesus Christ he can set anyone free.
when you don't have access to therapist, this feels like a therapy session
She didn't have anxiety in the Netherlands when she entered a store, was rude to everyone and flung some american dollars at the teller saying " this is american money". American money isn't worth anything in Europe. She's rude and entitled
af tá em inglês
This earned her so much respect in my book
That was great.
I was busy all my life,  now that im homeless I have anxiety.
Lol wtf
I'm happy Kendall did this. Relatable asf
Helpful. Thanks for sharing
Nothing new under the 🌞
You literally feel like you’re gonna die. It’s terrible. That’s how I can describe it best.
Although i am not the biggest fan of Kendall Jenner i do believe that she has anxiety. The way she explains what she’s went/going through is very telling. No matter what living situation you’re in, if you have anxiety it will creep up on you and that’s honestly one of the worst things about it.
Dr Ramani looks like she could be Kendalls mum. Dr Ramani is incredible...my hero
I liked this channel until I saw they invited one the kadashians - either cause doctor Ramini is naive or part of their system. Either way as usual the kardashians and all the group of soul/ time/ blood  suckers succeeded to introduce my world by coming exposing their «  problems » to the entire world on one of the channel I like(d) - liked in the past cause as soon as I see them come corrupt one of my friends or people I like -> Unsubscribing. Ramini : not supporting soul suckers like the kardashians on this planet. Only problem in my life is their presence on earth. That shouldn’t have happened like ever.
Always a help to others when someone famous shares their anxiety story 💜
Besides this discuss was really cool and helpful, to every single phrase the doctor said Kendall was like: yeah, uhum, right, right, yeah, aham, okay x 59 times. Haha 🤣 I loved the conversation, but it really distracted me omggg, pls say it wasn´t just me
Yes I too had an anxiety attack last night around 8:30 till 9:45 I was so out of breath and then I said my mom i was literally shaking for some minutes I felt like I am going to die lol
I still have one of these. Do you know what I mean? And that thing up there sometimes, like, doesn't always (..). It's not always like happy and It's not always connecting. I'm still a human being at the end of the day. No matter what someones have or don't have. It doesn't mean that they don't have real-life, feelings and emotions.
Good for Kendall that she is bringing the issue to the forefront and her honesty.
Anxiety is horrible and hard to deal with.  I alway had compassion for people with anxiety orders never knowing l would experience the disorder myself.
Who notice.... she's telling right a lot 😃🥰
Anxiety is more present in urban areas compared to that of rural areas. Amish people are not usually found in urban places.
Try having anxiety and not being rich and famous.
I guess there is a lot of pressure for celebs like her to always look perfect. All your relationship failures are out there for the public to see … not much privacy
I know nothing about these folks but it’s pretty obvious if you’ve been in the psychology field for any length of time: She grew up with nothing in her control. She still has nothing in her control, but the public thinks she can have anything she wants. Everyone around her created her problems, and she leans on those same people to solve them (trauma bond). Unless she runs away, this will never solve itself.
Here for Dr Ramani
Before I was really overwhelmed, really overworked.                                                                    I was always around people and I kind of got really                                                                       overwhelmed with all of that, to the point where I was like                                                                       I need to like be alone.                                                                       Now, it's more like, okay, we've all been super isolated                                                                       to the point where I'm almost like so used to that, that now                                                                       that things are slowly opening up,                                                                       if I go to a dinner or if I see a few more of my friends                                                                       than I'm used to seeing throughout this last year,                                                                     that gives me anxiety.
Anxiety is NOT a super power! The clinical terminology is anxiety DISORDER because it's a mental state where things are NOT in ORDER or not regulated and the person is, in affect, out of control. When this disordered state starts to affect the person's ability to function in a healthy way, you've got super problems and not supergirl! And telling a person otherwise is bad advice and is actually doing them harm. I'm surprised at the content in this video. (Dr. Ramani is a highly skilled psychotherapist and I'm sure mentioned these points, but it was unfortunately edited out).
Dr Ramani ladies and gentlemen!!!! You were born for this.
honestly one of the best vogue videos out here i love the entire mood and calm vibe. beautiful
Don't care for that billionaire but that doctor is pretty good
- Don’t know about her anxiety. But sye clearly has a pick - me syndrome. She’s lying through her teeth in the video and portraying herself to be different. Seeking male validation!
Kendell is by far more centred than the therapist.
And thank you Dr. Ramani for giving a more detailed perspective on anxiety....now some of my own behaviors  make more sense!
Thank you for sharing your story. It shows that you are a human being with real issues like everyone else! ❣️
kendall jenner wont shut up for fucks sake let the Doc talk
It's pretty ironic that Vogue decides to do a piece about Anxiety...lol and with Kendall Jenner of all people.
Wish Kendall would just let Dr ramani talk.  All the "right"'s and "yeah"'s... very cringy.
This was really special.  Thank you so much for sharing your story.
Being early and being prepared is what I usually do to reduce my anxiety when in public.
Civilized society produces anxiety.
She's also a mean girl and the cause of other peoples mental health issues.
I wish I can meet with the good Dr. 😔😔😔😔😔
It’s actually not Always just in your head .. I had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and the physical symptoms come up without me thinking about anything .. so sometimes you either had a chemical imbalance in your brain or hormonal imbalance in your body that is causing it . Stress is also a cause and so is other underlying illness like thyroid disease. For other people, it is just all in their head . Either way .. medication and therapy can balance your body out and guide you back to a normal life.
Anxiety (Julia Michael´s song) is my anthem...
She may have money but her life would give most people anxiety..
I have a lot of respect for Kendall Jenner now
I've faced anxiety myself and it really is horrible and seeing Kenny come up and talk about this, litreally makes me so happy <3
It's not just the thing up there there, but also the thing on the left side of your chest.
its demons / unclean spirits that cause anxiety
I love you Dr Ramani but if your channel is partnering with vogue to boost these woman... It's not a good look at all. Not at all.
Dr. Ramani is excellent!  Kendal is such a down to earth young lady.
my favorite kardashian
This video made me so anxious.
I have went thru A LOT in my life but by far the worst feeling in the world is anxiety. Sometimes you can have panic attacks when you aren't even worried in your mind and sometimes you will experience different symptoms that you never experienced before and like Kendall said the best feeling is knowing others have gone thru it bc it does feel like death.
We love you kendall
Dr. Ramani is so insightful and articulate.
Thank you
Dr Ramani is the star of this Vogue clip!
Kendall are so beautiful inside, always have been since I can remember. THANK YOU, I just shared this with my younger daughter who is starting to get anxiety. I’m someone that has struggled with anxiety since a young age as well, I didn’t understand it until I was 30 years. Thank you for opening up! Please stay yourself
Dr Ramani is the best hands down she makes me feel so calm its amazing I love all her videos God bless this woman she has so much wisdom and she is so humble ❤ 🙏 love her ! Thank you for helping alot of people
Is there an official psychologic term for people saying the word "like" every 2 seconds? Because THAT gives me anxiety...

This interview made me uncomfortable, because it felt too scripted or something. Severe anxiety is crippling, disabling, and makes you feel like you're dying. You get dizzy, vertigo, lose all sense of up and down and become spatially disoriented, your heart pounds and palpitate and you gasped desperately for air as the flood of tsunami-like waves crash over you, crushing you, you can experience numbness, and you feel like you are going to faint (and might!) Noise and activity around you becomes extremely over stimulating, and it becomes unbearable. Loud noises, crowds, too many people, too much activity becomes intolerable. Full blown panic sets in. I know this feeling all too well. I also have Babesia, Lyme Disease and other tick borne infections, and one of the classic symptoms of Babesia is air hunger and debilitating anxiety. I mention this, as there can be a missed underlying cause. I think having a mother with Narcissistic Personality Disorder in combination with addiction such as alcoholism can also lead to severe anxiety in her children. I know this firsthand, as well. Kendall, you are definitely not alone in this. As far as what other people choose to do regarding their own health, they have the right to make their own decisions regarding their own body, and sometimes you need to learn to let go of the control.
God I love you two
I didn’t know I’d have so much in common with Kendall and this conversation makes me 😍❤️🥺
Have been praying for your family for a while now.
Figures
4:37 very informative! Thank you
Kendall is such a beautiful and sweet person, she talks and acts so different than her other sisters. And speaking out mental health is amazing,  I hope she gets better! 💕
Listening to this really helps ease anxiety.  https://youtu.be/k6OeZUYOI_Q
It is interesting to note that anxiety and mental health cases are growing astronomically. I do think that it has a lot to do with the media industry, the fake & hedonistic lifestyles, focussed highly on appearances and items possessed. Whats inside of us that is not connecting well to ourselves is our soul not connecting to all this materialism, our soul needing, crying, begging to connect to God in His truest form. And our souls connecting to its true purpose rather than getting lost in this world, which is not going to last forever. How can soul be at ease when it does not know its real creator, does not recognize Him, does not know him and does not love him?  This series expains the attributes of God in detail.  https://youtu.be/K1BA4ZzTnWU
"22" that's my favorite song by my girl
I thought Dr Ramini didnt do private practice anymore??? I guess you have to be a millionaire victoria secret model complaining about being anxious in order to get a sit down with her.
Can’t I make the case that all of these physical symptoms are a direct result of having Kris Jenner for a mom?
She probably has the same voice like Kylie 🥺
alot of people have food allergies which can mimic anxiety symptoms, like hyperventalating, headache, dizziness, shaking, nausea, brain fog, etc....so when people are having "anxiety" they should think about what food they just ate and what did they just have to drink?...caffeine can also cause alot of problems, as can sugar intake.....write down foods and drinks to see if these attacks happen after something has been consumed :) i have both food allergies, and anxiety/panic attacks and it can be difficult knowing which is which.....
Kendall Jenner is a super narcissist. She threw a tantrum because her sister wore the same dress as her. She has many other dresses to wear but she is a brat. The talking crap to her mom's boyfriend.... total disrespect to her elders. Worse than Kim.
That really proves that she's really just like all of us, but only with a more famous life.
Great video. Kendall have always been opened about her anxiety but i didn't know how much she struggled with it.
SHE IS SO REAL
I like Her Personality. She is so open
That’s so true . When u  suffering with anxiety you have to have ppl  around you with   Happy conversation
This is incredibly brilliant! I would love to have Kendal come on my mental health podcast if she would be open to it.
Its good to see her show this side of her. Very smart girl.
Mad props to Kendall for doing this, thank you!! Also I loveeee Doctor Ramani, such an awesome lady.
Why would someone say she has nothing to worry about because of her money and or luxurious life well I tell you is not that for their is nothing wrong to have what she haves rather how she uses it is what determines if is bad or wrong or good but she has every reason to worry though and she doesn’t need to spend hundreds of dollars to so called experts I’ll tell her for free. She has a spiritual problem that is manifesting in the body and she doesn’t need gurus or therapists she needs a quiet room where she can be alone and call on Jesus, he’ll show up
Sound like you described a panick attack
Beautiful inside and out. Let her popularity and voice serve as a wake up call to society and mental illness awareness.
So if your mind has the capacity to make you sick (physically), then your mind can make you feel better, heal your body. I hope that everybody gets this simple basic thing "Your thoughts control your reality(health, relationships)". If you want to feel good/better, you can. Just deciding that you want to feel good, you are one step ahead in your healing process. When I get anxious about something, the first thing that I repeat to myself is "I trust my future to be good".It is not an overnight process, I repeat the statement whenever I feel anxious over and over again so that my brain switches into this thought whenever I feel anxious. Btw anxious --> fear of future, depression --> still holding on to the past(I repeat "I'm willing to let go of the past that is no longer serving me". Listen to this while you sleep , it literally did a miracle to my subconscious brain and saved my life. I hope you heal ,sending love and light :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbdB2ss1YLs&list=PLPLHdtBhWOjl2ks0AUqzmuv7MAv_X3CTQ&ab_channel=Doyouwanttobefree%3F
I really like it when people of a celebrity status comes out cause we always believe people of success are perfect but coming out with mental health issues shows u can b a success inspite of mental health issues.
I will never understand why people believe that rich People should not have anxiety! Are they crazy?? Rich People would have more! Surrounded by users,  constantly being Watched,  People pretending to care to use you as a product....that is not worth the money. We are all human, er need genuinen connection, love, respect, and saftey. That groß for ALL of us. Kendall,  go into Psychology! Then you would have underdtsndung, empathy for your Clients, and fulfillment! You could help children and adults rossed in this Type if situation!😀
Kendall was painful to watch. It's like she listens to speak, not to understand, and at times cut off Dr. Ramani.
I'm just glad she doesn't do the long drawn out words, like her sisters, she's herself.
I really like Dr. Ramani's videos she's so clear, concise and relatable.
She look good with her butt chin. I should love mine too 🥰
The problem is that for people who have economic issues for example your anxiety can be magnified by 100. So yes she does have it better and can access professional help and the best therapists and latest innovations while others can't. There are studies about how a healthy brain (organ) is key in changing our lives when it comes to mental illness but some have more access to this type of information and rescourses than others so no we are not in the same boat.
REV VHUUIIIOPO
i love her and relate to her so much
Your nothing but a product
Kendall is so genuine!. Love her.

I don’t have anxiety, be fearless, don’t worry about others judgment...I’m fearless outgoing and I am outspoken and one time I thought have narcissistic disorder or narcissism I can fight off negativity so easily..but always remember never hurt anyone physically..be kind be generous be blessed!! Life is too short
Yeah, I can’t get behind this video with the Jenner person. That whole family are attention-seeking body snatchers. Good bye.
https://youtu.be/MiajWnOeJK0
What I’d give to book a session w/ Dr. Ramani..
Doctor Ramani! I look up to you! Your awesome! ❤♥️
I have the same thing sometimes we forget celebrities are also people with personal and real problems thank you Dr Ramani.
Kendall is so NATURALLY BEAUTIFUL!!! She reminds of the 1970s of Natural and Pure Ivory commercials
The obnoxious tablecloth early wish because liquor joly colour off a ceaseless albatross. spicy, moldy boundary
Great info.
It should be illegal to be this beautiful😍
Love how you said the nice things about anxiety! We don't hear that enough. Looking at my own anxiety that way helps me find a way to embrace it so I can live a balanced live with it :)  Daily training my body and mind to interact better through using both to influence the other is the other key I found :) 🙏💚
🖤🖤learned alot
But Kendall is so comfortable being rude towards others, and I'm not even referring to the general public, I'm talking about the people who she is familiar with and are around her on a regular basis. I think if you want people to be understanding and show kindness, treat others the way you want to be treated.
Her voice is amazing 🤩
Kendall Jenner wants me to fill sorry for her? Lol
For the first time in  my life, I can relate to Kendall Jenner.
I am dealing with this now…..This is exactly the advice i needed….I’m almost in tears.
❤
The only treatment I can suggest for her is a comedy show, a btttle of red wine, a nice massage and a long nice cuni....gus. I never met a woman who received this treatment and was still anxious😂😂😂
All those cameras i would have extreme anxiety too.  We can't control our anxiety, its something we have to cope with.   Mindfulness saved my life!
If anything she just has more stuff to be anxious about than regular people

i praise you son just this
Dr ramadi is really getting getting big
This is so beautiful
Dr. Ramani is the premier psychologist commentator on narcissism. Best low key trolling of all-time.
Ugh she's got nothing to be anxious about. My god.
I do not like the title of the video. The focus is not Kendall but Dr. Ramani and her vast knowledge on anxiety and beyond!
Godbless you pretty
I clicked so fast when I saw Dr. Ramani!! 😆
That’s always been the issue. So many people think automatically that people in Hollywood don’t get anxiety. “They have money, they’re rich. why would they have anxiety”. None of that means anything when it comes to anxiety. Equivalent to saying if you don’t love yourself, nothing you have will truly be good enough. We’re all human!
why do they have this scary psychologist come on all the time
#Indiamalike👈 is video
As someone with severe general anxiety since I was 5, I loved that. It shines some light on how it is and how hard it can be and get. I’m happy she opened up about it because for some reason people don’t talk about it. I know I didn’t talk about it for the longest time by fear of people judging and telling it was nothing. In some cases (me) it takes over your life and it’s hard.
❤️❤️❤️Love Lord Jesus ❤️❤️❤️
Is she a supermodel or Instagram model ??
Goes to show you have celebrities don't have perfect lives and are people too
People saying she can’t have anxiety, she has an anxiety disorder not just anxiety, she was born with anxiety as a disorder
Wow! I thought I was the only one. Thanks for sharing!!
Doctor Ramina  I know that you can become a millionaire  but  please don't become a  television doctor  .Also it is your choice
This is me.
WHEEEEEEEERE ARE THE ASKERRRRRRS
"overworked"
I'd have anxiety too if my dad was mentally ill.
I love Dr. Ramani! Thank you for all do to help the people. Be well, Kendall, I hope you start feeling better, hun. ❤

love Kendall
I honestly feel like all of this talk is VERY privileged. I’m not saying being physiologically awarded is a bad thing ! But please do realize that half of the world’s population doesn’t even have a concept what it means to be educated like this , let alone live in a society that is hyper aware of the minds . We are very fortunate .
That sounds like you just said you are a narcissist. Most narcissist are renaming their medical diagnosis she said  something's that don't add up at all but she wanted to do the video.
Great video, thanks for sharing! Have a calm and relaxed day! Stay healthy and safe! 👍😊🍓
i just love the way she's so open about her anxiety... this actually calmed my panic attack down and im just very thankful Kendall is so honest and open about this.. thank u ♡
Why do you have anxiety when your lives are so beautiful?
Baby love you
It's brave to expose urself completely candidly to your therepist ... I just feel like this should have been done privately if the goal was to really heal and grow... The fact that make up artists were present and this was always meant to be recorded and shared steals away the genuine. It's a publicity stunt...ppl who hurt and want to heal do it in private. I love the unbiasedness of Dr. Ramani...she is just a woman doing her job...but u can't fool me... she's a narc...for sure...play ur middle mid range... Pity plays...how much money are the kardashians making off of this??? SMH
I know she won't probabky read this but I want to thank Kendall for being opened and honest. I'm sure this will help many many people. Me for example 💖
Not to be insensitive, but I feel this is a ploy to garner sympathy for the Kardashian’s so they can make more money off of us by making us think they are “more like us than we think.” When you have as much money as the Kardashian’s do, you can hire the best psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists and receive the best mental health support than anyone else. Why are they telling us about their problems? We’re the ones who struggle to receive support because of financial difficulties or a lack of access. When you have money, you can buy anything you want.
Dr. Ramani its one of the best Psico i ever heard. She helped so much my self healing. God bless Ramani! <3
I disagree with her saying she lives a very blessed lifestyle. The rich and famous are not living in accordance with nature and abundance. "Live simply so others may simply live" comes to mind. I feel extremely compassionate for women like this one because even when they are trying to humanise themselves it comes across as unauthentic. This may be because it is. Or it may be that despite all the wonderful things she has to be grateful for, she is still in the gutter with the rest of us  scrambling around in our minds for meaning and purpose. Material wealth can be the obstacle to finding your true life's purpose. Too many distractions. Nice clothes, cars, houses, holidays.... Where is the time for stillness? For compassion? For service to others?   Do not aspire to live her life. The meek shall inherit the earth because the meek have nothing to lose, they surrender to life happily. When you surrender you find something magical
im really glad that shes still white
i love u ma dia for believing in your self and the fact that  your on natural
I am happy that people talk about anxiety.I struggle for 5 or 6 years and I didn't find even 1 day easy.Because of Covid,I have developed Agoraphobia and very scary Depression.I hope someday in medical terms we all know much more about it so we can stop feel this pain.
I love how she actually filmed this. The idea of therapy and anxiety and talking about everything is so important to destigmatise
I am rich as quick and did it very very quickly with like 0 zero effort at all
Gosh, Kendall, THANK YOU <3 we feel more understood and accepted now too :)
I feel this way everyday
I'm here for Dr Ramani. Love her!
Number 1 way to help cure anxiety: stop giving a f*ck what everyone thinks of you, cause 99% of those people probably dont care about you and you most likely dont care about them. The drive and love of your family is what you need to focus on and it'll keep you grounded.
7:03 I can’t even do that. My own mother tells me to stop talking nonsense if I even bring up the topic of depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. She tells me other people have it worse
I don’t judge you Kendal, I just think your family is toxic as f*** and that’s probably the stem on your problems
Nobody cares
I love Dr Ramini
YES MORE PEOPLE SHOULD TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES US VULNERABLE.  Props Kendall and I love you Dr. Ramani. You changed my life and you're a real role model!
OxxO
143 Ken... Let's make it
Dr.Ramani is awesome

I didn’t know being anxious about your health is called a Hypochondriac. Wow. I just learned something new. That’s so me.
Kendall is so genuine. I love this. Thank you for sharing your journey with us Kendall. ✨
Never give high level exposure, as a public figure, actress musician,never give the public this much of your life.
I would be blind if I received that amount of camera flashes…..
Thanks you so much 💗💓for sharing...DJ.DEB.USA SAYS
Hahaha yeah I couldn't do what she does, I would have a mental breakdown every minute. The cameras alone would END me
Ohh poor of my Mexican grandma
Thank you for this
Kind of surreal watching the top authority on all things narcisism having a conversation that is not about narcisism with one of the world's biggest narcisist.
I have social issues associated with my mental health. It’s nice to have someone like Kendall share her story. It gives me that little bit of hope for my future.

I respect you so much Kendall! I know a 17years old girl keeps saying: I'm so awkward. Now I know it's Social Aniety. BIG thanks!
Thank you for this!
She tries to be relatable but just … misses the entire mark
Melania Trump, the mujer mas bella compared to frumpy wife of pedo Biden!
Kendall is beautiful! I'm sure everybody already knows this.😐
NOBODY NEEDS PSYCHOLOGIST OR THEOLOGANS OR SCHOLARS OR COLLEGES OR COLLEGE AT ALL ACTUALLY
Thx you for "normalizing"/opening up the conversation/admitting of social anxiety so those dealing with it (like me) don't feel like a weirdo or alone in it.
Lake Havasu, AZ USA 6/28 to 7/02/2021. RIGHT now 6/27/2021 around 7:25AM PST
PRACTICING AMERICAN ACCENT WITH SHADOWING TECHNIQUE: (working progress) 0:01 - 0:05 ( I am very aware of my anxieties) 0:05 - 0:09 ( I don't like the pity party / I don't like talking about when I like don't feel too well) 0:10 - 0:14 (I don't know, I am a little nervous jus being kinduv open about like what I struggle with) 0:15 - 0:19 ( and like making it known to other people's a bit nerve wracking) 0:55 - 0:59 (I remember being really young) 0:59 - 1:01 (I'd say like eight, nine, ten, like around that time) 1:02 - 1:03 (and I remember having shortness of breath)
I just wanna say thank u for the free therapy session it helps me a bit
So many people that should sitting down with a doctor of her prestige instead of Kendell Jenner.  Come on...... Privilege privilege privilege
Dr. Ramani is the GOAT!!!
Blackpink for next cover please
They’re thieves..  end of story..  and I know for a fact they messed around with major corporate dollars..
Kendall Jenner is telling Dr. Ramani, ‘You’re like, so right.’…okay then
I am checkin on you. I know you are having a blessed day, Amen David James West, a Christian man
Just because someone is priviliged or is very rich that doesn't mean that they don't have issues. As we say money can't buy happiness or peace of mind.
Good on yo been there 🙏
Love Dr. Ramani!
Dr. Ramani, I love how down to earth and real you are in any situation. This is a great snippet and a very informative video!
My new chenal soppt me
https://youtube.com/channel/UCYOuaDiLCniVCZv6x_0ja4Q
https://youtube.com/channel/UCYOuaDiLCniVCZv6x_0ja4Q
Oy. Kendalls responses every few seconds (yeah, right, mhmm) are distracting.
I don’t think she’s honest with her full crap story 🙄🤨
I completely understand having anxiety but what I don't understand is people who belittle others and laugh about it
Idk what's going on im just leaving this here 😂💀
The irony of a narcissism expert sitting down with a member of this family.
Lovely inteview, thank you to both of you lovely ladies!
I can actually relate to kendall, only except im not a celebrity lol. I have a very few friends because ive witnessed a lot of fake relationships at my school and ive been a victim of fake treatment and approach by a lot of my schoolmates and classmates since i was in middle school. Im not the fun and jam type of student but im also not those kids that always put their friendship problems in public and spread rumors and backstab about their friends behind their backs lol. Many people might think that im too cold or too plain to be a friend but its honestly cause im always aware of the possible consequences of risking myself in trusting other people. I used to get anxiety a lot when im at school but i always seemed a bit rude and cold on the outside. But really its only cause im always scared and on guard all the time.
https://youtu.be/-0J6lPUJFRs
No one can fill you up God designed our hearts so Jesus Christ can be the one that fulfills that empty void. He is the puzzle to our life. Jesus Christ can set you free, and take away that anxiety that feeling of fear, and sadness. Repentance and trusting in jesus as your lord and savior. God set me free he can do the same with you.
Woooow dr. RAMANI IS THE GOAT
Who’s this girl?
I have a really bad case of social anxiety. It's the worst, but it's comforting to know that you are not alone. Thanks for this little talk! 💕
There's a reason for the anxiety..Most Angels hold a great deal of anxiety. ANU the water or great Isis exist in all of us. The water was poured before the fire was lit up. It took anxiety, vibration and El or electricity to create power, matter and energy.. Learning to control "your anxiety" or contained energy within the vessel. Why you must be balanced/grounded when around crowds that "charge" you...
This is the story of my life
Kendall cheap personality!  Everyone knows what she did to other celebs. She is a mega jealousy person. She had ruined many people's live. She had destroyed many people's relationship. She is such an evil person in media.ryt now
i just love it when celebrities use their massive influence to reinforce awareness and to educate others  💛
Who cares
Feel this ❤️
I really relate to the magnifying glass note; I literally thought I had sepsis, a stone in my mouth, lymph node cancer, damaged vocal cords when it was only jaw pain lmao
prime example and proof that just because you are born into fame and fortune, doesn't mean that your personality will just gel naturally with the lifestyle.
U are a boy
The scared weasel intraoperatively need because catsup nutritionally beam inside a honorable alphabet. thankful, confused bar
This just made me feel so much better. Knowing that I’m not the only one dealing with it.❤️
I mainly went here because Dr Ramani specializes narcissism & Kendall belong in one of the most narcissistic family to ever exist.
everyone mad it’s kendal but what’s kendal supposed to do? decline the offer to talk about mental health? she has a huge platform i don’t understand why she’d get any hate for this
As my therapist likes to say “Everyone has Anxiety”
But so no beauty it is sturieod atiffial
this drives me to no end wait till she has a kid lmao.When she doesnt have enough for rent she will find out fast enough what anxiety is and in labour spoilt brat
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ip04ffFz-o
this episode really helped.thank you Vogue and Kendall and also Dr Ramani
Kendal is too real and I love her.i love you kendall
God who cares another socialite getting entire show about her “anxiety” when there’s people dying all over the world
Yeah rigth anxiety for being kardashian priviliged white girl whit out any Grace to model AND walk
I am watching this because of Doctor Ramani's
My baby's all grown up
Kenny is literally my identical! I mean that anxiety and *black sheep* thing
Thanks Kendall for being an advocate about anxiety
Dr. Ramani our lovely beast. She is the best!
Very very good xx
Very very good xx
i know anxiety is a serious issue however anxiety is not a excuse for being judgmental and mean. always using anxiety to your irresponsible behavior is not okay  also she talks about how social media affects her in a bad way but still she photoshops her body to a point where it’s literally not possible and she gets plastic surgery and fillers but still lie about it and act like its her ‘natural beauty’  social media does not only affects her she has so many young followers that thinks this is what they supposed to look like her and her family created this impossible body and beauty standards and now they cry about it  i never see someone who met her and thinks she is kind she gets here because of her family and still acts like a diva 💀 (i am talking about in general not only about this video)
If stopped watching these people WHO ARE they to us
What a lovely young lady, so good to see her in the position she's in be so real and so raw!
CBT masterclass here-well done- Dr Ramani
She’s so honest about her ‘privilege’ and she is a lucky girl but she is also talented she is so brave ily
How could she not have anxiety? She’s had a lot thrown at her at an early age. Bless her... I know what she is saying and I think she is helpful to talk about it.
Dr Ramani is amazing! Follow her channel on narcissism. Brilliant.
Esto está solo en la mente gente y cuando se den cuenta se verán como estúpidos como lo acabo de hacer yo.
Thank you.!
such a Scorpio
Ugh, Kendall just wants her 5 mins of fame by playing the victim card.
She's so humble. I hope she finds someone with psilocybin mushrooms. She can heal with microdosing. I certainly did.
THANK YOUUU!!!!
Kendal you are part of the problem.
@athiyashetty and Kendall jenner are twins😍
this girl is so stupid and annoying. does she only know two words: 'like' and 'right'?
4:16-4:29 She just translated Radiohead's album "The Bends."
2:52-2:54 Miss Kendal is being a lowkey Karen! Yes i knew there was some Narcissism in there..."You're using that term lightly (passive-aggressive form of "how dare you?") and in my head i am like ahhh! (Narcissistic injury)".
1:46-2:02 Having a rich life doesn't always mean happiness.  Sure, you can be rich and happy, but only when you have a personal sense of integrity.  If you personally feel torn apart, depressed, whatever? Being rich will only make you feel worse.
It helps a little for me to know that someone of Kendall’s status, is the same as mine, or anyone else’s for that matter. Thank you Kendall for sharing your time and experiences with us!
Woo Dr. Ramani, love they brought her on!
شنو يعني ؟ نظافه
نظافه
She’s always in depth with feelings
I have anxiety and depression and it's really hard to deal with but the ones with depression or anxiety I hope God will help you through this hard time 🙏💕
Who else feel the heart pounding hard not fast but the heartbeats are very heavy and hard like someone hit you strong on your chest , and like a electricity past into your body , does that happen to you guys , please tell me??
I completely understand it.. no amount  of money in the world can take that anxiety away... It's a chemical imbalance in the brain
The staking inventory correlatively order because viola considerably list off a third yogurt. boring, heartbreaking atom
I loved this and it was needed!
Buahahahahaahhahahhaahhahah
Definitely not blessed if have anxiety crippling.  People use that word blessed too loosely.  This person is cursed if you have all this.
And I have to say this I don't feel I have a mental disorder. I feel like I just care about others more than I care about myself. I will suffer before I let anyone else I love or even just anyone. Even when I'm struggling I help others who are struggling worse. I will go without so they can have. But I'm a freaking lunatic. Although people tell me I'm an empath which I think is silly I just care. That's the problem in the world today people just don't care about anyone but themselves.
the doctor dr ramani is the star of the video and kendall maybe the star in the video but she is the star OF the video and her name isnt even in the title. I had to go to down below in the description to learn it. PUT IT IN THE TITLE for crying out loud.
I really expected more accepting and loving people under these comments...
Dr Ramani is always amazinggggg
She's looking so KK eye section
Two very articulate women. It helps to know we’re not alone.
We're starting to heal as a planet and when someone like her out and is honest and open it really creates momentum for others to do the same because she's famous
I’m so happy that Vogue really opens up or talk about this topic that PEOPLE RARELY TALK ABOUT. I’m so happy. Really happy. That VOGUE made episodes  about this. Thank you Vogue. Also the last part that doctors give some advice and Tips for some people who are experiencing it
I also had thoughts like what if this persistent headache means I have a brain tumour, told myself I am being crazy. Turns out I wasn't, luckily tumour was found before it got too big (had a seizure.) Hopefully people don't write it down to just being 'silly' or over thinking, rather check up when you feel something is wrong than regretting it later
The very best. David James West, a Christian man
You are on my heart this morning. You have the best coming to you, Amen David James West, a Christian man
nice video #technicaljahanilm
YOU DESERVE THAT FOR HURTING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR YOUR OWN EGO, YOUR OWN HAPPINESS AND FOR YOUR OWN ADVANTAGE......TALKING ABOUT SELENA AND TAYLOR WHAT YOU DID TO THEM.....YOU BACKSTABBER
I'm glad Vogue is raising awareness on anxiety but I wish they could go a little bit deeper.  Because anxiety has a lot to do with a low self-esteem and the need to be liked by everyone. Competitive and narcissist people also feel anxious when they feel they'll show weakness or imperfection. So, anxiety can be the consequence of a much more complex disorder or problem to solve. It's hard to get over anxiety if you haven't worked on your ego. It takes effort to admit that our mindset can be based on toxic principles.
Kendall: 'Right right right right right right okay right RIGGGGGHT ok yeah YEaaaaah right' Jesus and Mary now that gives me anxiety.
She's naturally beautiful...other sisters are just surgeries that's all..
Love her for this ❤️🥺 she’s so brave for speaking on her mental health
Jesus
The world is sic Kendall...It's all in your head mentally Intheleast which can manifest physically inthemost...that means it's one thing to hurt yourself it's another to hurt others...I wish you well

She lives in a "glass house", on display all the time.  Isn't it normal to feel anxiety in that circumstance?  So aren't her feelings simply normal?  What would happen for her if she dropped out of that rat race?
Wow happy to see Doc Ramani here 🌸💟
I like kendall jenner she is a great actress.
DO THIS WITH ZAYN
Excuse me for my ignorance, but doesn’t everyone feel anxiety? Isn’t it just a natural response in our bodies like anger, happiness, sadness etc?
I could watch many hours of this, it's so helpful to hear that others get it and to hear all the analogies and tips, etc.
"I don't like the pity party."  As a fellow anxious scorpio, I highly connect to that.
She looks plastic
I am not an introvert.  Not a shy person.  Usually i happy face. I have anxiety. I feel it so hard to even write it down. Cause i already feel the judgement i may get. But still. I always talk openly about it. I know people think of me as crazy attention seeker. When i share it with my friends i just feel like no one care. But whenever i have those moments i just feel so helpless.  I just couldn't breathe.  I had that while having a argument with my roommate. I had period cramps, wasn't in a mood and she wanted to discuss something and things got heated. But after that i couldn't breathe for 1 hour I kept struggling and was helpless.  But now when i talk , everyone thinks i was overreacting.  Sometimes even i feel i overreacted. Maybe it's not so bad. Maybe i feel happy being sad, being  a victim to get people's attention. Now i am also confused. But still just wants to say that it's difficult to go through it alone.  Sorry for all bs i wrote.
I would advise Kendall to read a book "The Final Circle of Paradise", 1979, by Arkadiy and Boris Strugatskiye. It explains why social media (in our reality) or "sleg" (in this book) can never replace or become real life. Is is dangerous in many ways, not only by taking your life or health. You loose such a treasure like real  experience, feelings and self esteem. How she sees my comment...
like, right, mmmm
She has anxiety until there's a party
Dr Ramani saved my life.  Her YT channel on Narcissism woke me up and helped me escape.
This was outstanding....Bravo! 👏👏👏
I have anxiety and it sucks.
Dr Ramani is blowing up 😊⭐️ we love to see it
You don’t have anxiety that bad until you deal with depersonalization, derealization, intrusive thoughts etc. the anxiety you get for being around stressful situations is peanuts and isn’t considered suffering to people who REALLY have anxiety.
The paltry trigonometry behaviourally beam because hubcap inspiringly pour per a blushing wound. steadfast, young operation
using the term loosely while saying you’re feeling anxious is valid. anxiety is a natural human reaction to adrenaline. anxiety DISORDER or PANIC disorder is a whole other level.
wow shes fat
This was beautiful. Thank you Dr. Ramani♥️
I have silent anxiety attack flying ✈️
"wow i feel this" (throws birthday party with hundreds of people)
Could you please Put a Triggerwarning in the description box because of flashing Lights? Thx :)
This lady just described my anxiety to the T.
I got anxiety just by watching this 😬
I really loved this thanks
just because she is famous, people act like she can’t  have problems in her life. she is obviously aware of how privileged she is. you guys don’t see how she lives, and u are just judging her for what you see. let her live come on now
I love Dr Ramani, love her <3
The only thing I disagree with is telling your loved ones. Please be careful, not everyone is mature enough to understand. It’s not safe. I tried to tell my in laws to help them understand a few of my quirks and they literally mock me now. I thought being transparent and vulnerable would help our relationship but it gave them more ammunition against me. It’s painful. Just be careful. Sometimes sharing adds more anxiety.💜
I love dr. Ramani. For Kendall I think it's deeply problematic that she launched a tequila line only days after this big interview when alcohol is the number one self medication for anxiety that makes things infinitely worse.
Kendall is the most beautiful woman out of family
I feel bad for Kendall when kylie was pissed at her for not being sociable enough, people doesn’t have any idea about what we’re going through on a daily basis
I’m glad that this woman talks easily bc as someone that doesn’t speak English, I completely understand everything.
If she says “right” ONE MORE TIME 🙃🔫🔫🔫
Never trust when a product tells you she's a person.
Wow everything makes so much sense
She’s amazing!!! I relate to a lot of things she mentioned.
Anxiety is exhausting. Love her transparency 💜
Always remember to be nice to everyone bc EVERYONE (yes even the rich and famous) are silently going through things
Love Kendal!!!
*overworked lol
I'd a borrowed the hall pass already!!! LOLOLOL!!!
Her lifestyle is a choice and she could possibly mitigate her some of her anxiety by changing careers. If she wants to pursue her dreams, anxiety is going to be a part of her life unless there is a change in her routine. I hope she finds healing. Truthfully, beauty and wealth does not make you immune to anxiety. Her feelings are valid. I do believe she could feel a little better if she changed her overall lifestyle.
Her nose slowly looking like Michael Jackson’s nose.
The lively year clearly rot because geranium virtually explain following a hard-to-find sky. incompetent, eatable plier
Her parents never taught her self love and she didn't have to be in the public eye as much as she did. Change both of those and she would be fine. It's basically extreme insecurities and self hate that makes her like this. No sympathy for a white women who cosplays a latina tho 🤮

Tell anxiety no thank you, next
Thank you vogue to bring this talk show and thank you Kendall Jenner for being open to this condition and thankew for telling all these stuffs... Anxiety doesn't consider how rich, how poor you are, it doesn't consider your beauty or success or how much privileged you are.... It can happen to anyone... I am dealing with it for years but just recently I've been to doctors... I hope it gets well and I wish no one have to face a lot through anxiety.....
hi kendall, im ben. i am really into anxiety. I actuall watched the 3 seasons of this by you, but it makes me wonder. i am still like you know “?????” right now in life. it is because i have acne breakouts its hard for me to socialize.
🤍
🤍🤍🤍
She needs to stop Stop smoking weed
She‘s a model. Throws or attends a party every week. Is active on social media. Stars at kuwtk and so one. Girl I don‘t believe you. Everyone who met you in person says your rude. Anxiety is not an excuse for rudeness. I‘m not sorry for you!
Kenny 🤎🤎
Please only let there be one stupid session, this chick has done nothing for no one and have more than likely negatively impacted the lives of her followers on social media and the fake standard of beauty the ENTIRE family pushed onto the masses. Laughable.
Ugh why even make this dude get this off my feed
Kendall Jenner throughout the interview: "yeah, right, okay"
Dr Ramani is so amazing. Such great suggestions 💖
Whaattt!!! Go Dr. Ramani ❤️❤️❤️
Whatttt!!! Go Dr. Ramani 💕 ❤️
take a shot everytime Kendall says "right", you'll be drunk in the blink of an eye
I also make a xexy channel, I hope you come to support me, thank you, dear!
Kardashians are king bb
A true American inspiration.
People can be famous any time. We can be rich in any time. WE DID NOT THIS YET. And maybe i have a lot of grammar problems but Kendal the Model is also Kendal the person. NOT my fav one but People... don't be mean, the girl is talking about anxiety like everyone of you do every single day. PERIOD
This woman is worth $45 million. Kendall is an elitst, hyper privledged female at the top of the Matriarchy in America.
6:12 so me, and its not fun...
Like Kim K and Kris Jenner had a baby! wow, their genes are so strong!
Wow this rich woman who can afford anything she could ever want cured my hallucinations and suicidal thoughts
I Know kendall IS Strong.
I bet she wouldn't think so much about what other's think if she didn't forget to put a shirt on.
💚💚💚
I watched this for her dr no for Jenner
SOOO eloquent & beautiful and real with this whole thing. thank you; i feel l i have the worst anxiety and paranoia and everyone notices every mistake i make. so thanks for making this l more known.
When i was born my mother and her doctor severed 20,000 of the human body's most sensitive nerves without anestia. I almost bleed to death. Because my mother wanted to control my behavior. And you think you have anxiety?
YouTube: mental health is important  Also YouTube: DEMONIZED NO FOOD MONEY
Now I know that I was anxious this whole time.
Thank you Kendall for opening up and being vulnerable.
Dr. Ramani is a saint
🤦🏻‍♂️
i love you kendall her anxiety is really similar to mine and im 13 i have anxietys like i feel numb on my body and i cant breathe now i control myself when i was 9 and 10 and 11 i couldnt so i would rush to my mom and cry because i thought im gonna die now i have control over it but its still bad and also i have a fear eating alot of sugar because of heart diseases and i dont wanna have it so what i do is just one sugary thing a day and found something and has no sugar its really hard for me but i cant do anything
You are aware of your anxieties but never been aware of attacking other artist during their anxieties and depressive state 😂😂😂 horrible person as always kendall
She keeps saying: right, right, right whatever the psychologist says. Fake and shallow. Just like her and her whole family’s  lifestyle. I just find it strange that she is one of the first interviewees of such a series
I can relate soo much tbh sometimes I feel like I’m gonna pass out & I can’t breath properly , I hate socializing a lot , I feel like everyone around me has a script except for me, I feel like everything I do is wrong & stupid & everyone around me is judging me …
Believe me all anxiety will gone if u come Palestine❤
this was not helpful vogue! everyone if you have anxiety check out this channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fyq8pT8IpCQ
i normally like kendall but please stop saying "right." i'm getting distracted. i agree she doesnt sound intelligent here and i wish it was just the doctor talking
I really wish Kendall spoke my eloquently. She really should diversify her vocabulary. She sounds so basic and unintelligent.
Take a shot every time Kendall says “right” 😂
Who is interviewing who ? Who is the host ? I am kinda being nervous ? Because the doctor won't let kendell talk for a second .
Dr.Ramani what do you think about YouTube chanell Kanika Batra?
Please do depression next!
Not to invalidate Kendal’s anxiety like I don’t think she’s being dramatic at all or that she’s using this as a publicity stunt like I believe her and everything but..... am I the only one who thinks this video is a bit tone deaf?
Thank you both for doing this!   Thank you for bringing the awareness, Kendall.
Español aquí
She's looking like Kim
Great interaction!
After this video I knew I had anxiety like shortness of breath is one of the things that I struggled with that’s why I couldn’t even go to swimming classes and even in the shower I don’t have long breath to say under the water
She looks so much like Kim in this video wow
Please support Palestine 🇵🇸 Palestine under attack. Murderer Israel is killing children, woman and man. Briefly Israel is killing humanity.  Be voice. Don’t ignore them because Israel cut Palestine’s social media. Help to Palestine. Just share one story or tweet or YouTube video . You have a heart. Don’t be silent. Support hastag  #HopeToGaza  #FreePalestine
take a shot every time she says riight
She’s such an amazing psychiatrist
I’m so glad their talking about this I can’t express how important this is
Love this thank you so much for doing this
Kendall is still genuine love it. Money and fame kill beautiful lives
I LOVE DR. RAMANI we need this is spanish Thanks!
Mi ídola y lo será siempre!
God bless you ❤️❤️❤️
when i saw the interviewer i was anxious for kendall
My friends wait tables at some 2 the restaurants she goes to and they constantly tell me how she not only doesn’t tip well at all but is so rude to them that she herself gives THEM anxiety for the way she talks down on them in front of other customers. This really seems like she’s just trying to make this part of her “brand”. Not a genuine person at all.
Thank you for the video but it doesn’t help so much  How can we deal with ocd type ?????
Her family perpetuates a lot of what is wrong with the world. No sympathy, she should just put down her phone and live in the mountains.
I know what she’s going threw, Cause Iam going threw very bad Anxiety and depression. And this is so Awful,
👍
Kendall is going to spit out a ton of kids soon it will be a comp of the cootchies between herself kyle and khloe to see who can spit the most out pow pow pow pop pop pop
Part 1 is DOCTOR RAMANIIIIII!!!!! AAAYYE!!! 😉😁👍🥇👏
We are a lot more alike than we are different.
I think that Kendall is the most humble, real, honest, natural and most beautiful of all the girls
What she experienced is very very real...❤️
She’s starting to look a lot like Kim!
I have gone through this, it's like shortness of breath pr is almost about 120 to 130 ,that's the scariest thing in the world, especially when you are alone!! And it happened on my biggest exam day ,and I failed on that day!! Cried like anything after coming out if the exam hall, I can't tell anyone unless someone has gone through that situation!! I am a graves patient and I understand this because it's everytime always!! Studying for my next exam... ,I am in a medical school so it's so hard for me to cope up things so easily.... I hope we get through all this and stay mentally healthy ❤️
Anxiety doesn't choose it's victim. One day you wake up and you're just shaking. Doesn't matter if you're the President, a popstar, or Kendall Jenner. Money can't really fix your emotions as far as you think it can.
Cool but didn't give Doctor Ramini near the justice she deserves
I hate this and hate watching this
I would be anxious too if I worshiped the devil. Why is the cabal monster even talking. No one wants to hear anything about her fake life or lies. So sad this doctor has a video with such a person. I won’t watch her videos now. Such a shame. I’ll never support cabal anything. I’m so so bummed. We can’t trust anything or anyone. Sucks
There are people who are genuinely proud of you opening up Kendall 🤍
I have social anxiety and it sucks (:
I am sorry people but many of you are saying Kendall is this or that, for example rude.  You don’t know her. You might have seen her on the show and at the end of the day it is a show , people are often different on the internet or they have a persona. The internet, instagram for example is about persona. You can only say if someone is like this or that if you met them in real life and interacted with them.
I kinda understand her. People are so mean on the internet. They are hating on a young beautiful woman. Some are jealous some are just mean because there’s something lacking. I hope people would be nicer. A person that loves themself would never throw shades hate people that they don’t know. Many people don’t love themselves and they use the internet to be negative.
❤️
A great tip is to look upwards! Also straighten your back and shoulders wide.  When we feel anxious we tend to lower our head and tighten our shoulders kinda curl up a bit which does not help. So keep ur body open not closed and keep ur head up, literally.  And I promise that’s gone help you a little bit =)

kardhasians are the one who give other celebrities headache and anxiety i wonder if kendall is lying !! oof
Aw she’s trying to sound relatable 😒
Eyeroll  ..
whatever
Next time bring a Jungian psychoanalyst and see what happens.
Being Gorgeous is like being a Brilliant Genius (Or very-very informed and well versed), long story short, it is not a good thing.   it just not. Any beautiful person or even Brilliant person who can dispute this fact, is NEITHER.
❤❤
It’s fantastic and helpful🥺💫
Omg guys I wanna thank you so much for sharing this information. I ve suffered anxiety my whole life and watching this has been a huge help to me , so thank you 🙏
Here's one thing not to be rude but She's famous which makes her kind of okay to be open about this stuffs that are considered taboo for normal people like us especially if you are born in an Indian household.
Wow! Thank you kendall 💖
Something doesn’t sit right with me about Kendall complaining that some of her friends are not taking covid seriously when she’s literally the one that held an illegal party
Its okay we all hate you and the family
On point . Thank you
She wants to be relatable so she sells more tequila.
I have anxiety AND i couldn't even talk about anything personal even with my "close friends" i just have the fear of them not wanting to listem to my stories and stuff.i still suffer it to this day.i want to try and be more open with my close friends

People just assume that she’s mean without knowing her.
Love this interview. Love Dr. Durvasula.
all I hear is “right” “mhmm” it’s bothering me lmfaooooo I love this it was just getting to me stg
You can fake honesty.. She has media training.. but she is pretty
Kendall always like : right, yeah, right, right , right, etc
Thank you Vogue and Kendall.
What about health anxiety? I developed health anxiety after being diagnosed with covid 19 the ending part of last year..Now I’m already healed but now I always think that something is wrong with my body.it makes me physically sick now because of the constant overthinking.. now I’m feeling it again ..what can I do??😢
Kendall Jenner looks so different...but I loved it so...
Everything Kendall shared is me😭😭😭 Glad to know I’m not alone.
Never in my life would I have ever thought that I would ever have anything in common with a Kardashian until now. Always liked her though, her and Khloe. They seem like the most normal humanlike out of the bunch, and I love that she is willing to talk openly about this in a way that let´s the rest of us know that it´s completly  normal and OK to have these feelings of anxiety. I totally respect and appreciate her and Dr Romani  for doing this.
Kendall... you are awesome.  I have anxiety too.  Thanks for sharing.
I klicked on this because of dr.Ramani... she's amazing
I just took my anxiety pills and this popped up on my recommendations. YouTube algorithm is getting scary 😟
I have social anxiety as well. It took me years to understand. Others still think Im weird and shy but it's so much more than that. Thank you Kendall ❣️
7:22 wasn’t she the one who threw a party during Covid in a nightclub with tons of people not wearing masks and asked her guests to not post pictures on social media ?? Yikes...
1:11       h a r r y
Is she anxious of getting saggy n old, she should be
I really wanna know how Kendall manages to do her modeling career on catwalks and stuff with anxiety because when I grow up I want to do it so bad but I have anxiety so just the thought of walking in front of all those people starring at you makes me nervous.
The cagey foundation critically guess because vein quickly learn against a crazy hospital. evasive, quickest case
This is obviously Kendall scrambling to fix her reputation. She’s just a rude human being, period.
I sort of caught myself warming up to her because I also have anxiety... But then I remembered her rude behavior, traveling and mass partying during a pandemic, her lack of sense, and the impossible beauty standard that she represents... And yeah still don't like her.
the part of this video that truly sent me was when she asked Dr. Ramani how to handle anxiety over a loved one who isn't being cautious about covid...weren't you the one who had a massive birthday-halloween party during one of the worst time periods for COVID?? and then told everyone not to take any pictures or videos to avoid being called out??
Wow this interview feels so important. Social anxiety. We lost our social skills as a society.
I think I just got diagnosed
Is anyone counting how many times Kendall says "right..." or "hmm." On the other hand, I do love & admire she's actually trying to raise awareness for mental health
I love u kendall ❤
stop smoking weed n ur anxiety will heal
Then he bow your head lets PRAY. We prayed outside in the parking lot where I lived. I do not remember all the the words but I do remember his saying you must believe with all your might as hard as you can. That was 31 years ago recently with everything that has been happening in our world. I let my thought NON-Threatening go to the left. About my job lose for 9 months bills pilling up. And yes I had so really physical signs. I keep have to tell myself that girl calm do stop going to the extreme like you do. Regina you will get through this. And then I am fine when I ASAP change the though. Chill I say YOU GOT THIS BOO.
I used to have Anxiety bad shortness of breath panic attacks I  even went to the hospital a few times Back around 1990. The doctors said you are fine just overwhelmed for me to lay of caffeinated drinks. I was a single parent raising 2 kids living with no family around.  All the bills never married. Not much skills and Someone told me REGINA you know you never have to have those attacks again.  Do you want to know they asked me.
I feel herr  ive been struggling with anxiety since covid started
Kendall Oh my God you look So MUCH LIKE YOUR SISTER  Kim.  Kendall you are so beautiful and you look so confident.  I have Anxiety at times about my not having a job needing to learn new skills and my housing situation or lack there of.  It is all MENTAL and mostly Non-threatening.  IF I let the Anxiety run away BECAUSE OF SOME CRAZY thoughts. Or  stories that we tell ourselves in our head at times become EXTREME and mostly not even true.
Good to see Dr. Ram kicking tail. She's so amazing. Great video.
Take a shot everytime Kendall says, "right".
She’s so not likable. 🤣
I hate that a lot of people view having anxiety and being shy as being “rude”. My parents don’t understand my anxiety (though they say they do) because multiple times after we have met people my parents have told me that the people probably thought I was rude and stuck up. It’s really does suck.
Totally I feel that and I’m aware of it and working on it also not me watching this after avoiding a family gathering today and since COVID-19 pandemic
Jesus loves y’all ✝️💕
right
I feel like she is the realist Kardashian/Jenner. The most natural looking and most relatable.
Poor thing I hear ya girl your not alone.Its a very real thing and scary feeling...Thanks for Sharing Kendall.God bless you.♡
Miss Jenner, she has had anxiety for a long time and it has to stop..........embrace it Kenny
seeing how many uneducated peasants saying bad things about her in the comments when she literally just talk about ✨mental health✨ and tryna open up about her feelings which is something that most people find it uncomfortable, it’s just NERVE WRECKING. educate urself about mental health, don’t go around, talk bluntly and be the cause of someone’s death.
um echt zu sein bin ich verliebt in kendall
sie ist echt zum vernaschen süß
:)
also ich würde sie sofort heiraten wollen
also man möche sie nur lieben und überall küssen und umarmen
kenny ist eine Herzliche  lustige fröhliche positive hübsche frau zum verlieben
Don’t care about rich people
so sind halt süße kleine wilde naschkatzen
just in time for mental health awareness month..
1:22 i cried cuz i luv her sm😭
all these people have anxiety bcz of religion. come to the right path of Islam and peace will follow.
Her problem isn’t acne ??
« I can’t breath »  Culture appropriation 🙄
Dr. Ramani is the sh*t
Dr ramani....luv her
An illuminating interview. I am 20 and I struggle with social anxiety .
Thank you
Omg anxiety? Lol stfu your makeup artist has anxiety rich fuks lol anxiety lol
Thank you so much for this,all of what you said Is literally me thank you for giving some tips

She had all strong bring-outs. The complexity of anxiety and its triggers are so vast, I do like how she kept it simple.   1 John 5:3 being the actions that speak louder than verbs, soft smiling is a perfect initiator to rekindle all first chancer relationships.   I have noticed though, that having much to live for, and having a lot of hope increases anxiety; whereas, others decrease anxiety when they have low hope or a loss of hope.  RIP DMX
Boring
THANKS 😊 🙏 😢 😿 😭  I have lived with SOCIAL ANXIETY and YES... I feel awkward in social groups. Glad Kendall Jenner is destigmatizing #ANXIETY. #ANXIETYhurtsALot!
To cope with my anxiety I focused on learning something.  It interrupted my focus on my anxiety and it really helped.
Dr. Ramani is a skilled and fantastic support system for anyone who wants to understand their own personal psychology.
Mine is cause of lack of financial resources to get the life I really want. The older I get and still haven't achieve the things I really want🤷🏽‍♀️
I'm so glad she shared that. I needed to hear that!! 💖
Не понимаю зачем я это смотрю...
Great job, Kendall. Such an important topic.
Being over worked these kids are so weak these days
I have always loved Kendall Jenner... I’m also overwhelmed! Please take care everyone. Mental health matters! 🤯 ❤️
But who doesn’t have anxiety in this day and age .... anxiety is so common nowadays!
Indeed you are blessed and very privaledged.You are also very very real. honest and open person..This.puts you on a whole new level. Its good for ppl to aee you as a regular person instead of just a famous celebrity. Shows you are human and face the same things like everyone else and Not just a beautiful face.Thank you Kendall for sharing your. story with us .it took a lot of courage !You are a wonderful young woman and i admire you.I wish you happiness and. much Love..to you...stay strong..💓💓💓🌸🌻🌹🌼
Omg. I deal with her symptoms every day. I wake up feeling like that like I can't feel anything or my heart feels like it's sinking and I've never thought it could be anxiety. Even feeling nervous and shaking uncontrollably
I just noticed how different she looks
Can you all just stop saying LIKE all the time?
whatever Kendall.
I’m glad they mentioned the “Social Bends”  post-covid a lot of us are experiencing in 2021 after society started slowly opening up. Totally relatable 💯
J'adore le concept  surtout  avec  kandel
thank you so much, I finally feel like I'm not alone and that someone really understands what it feels like living with anxiety
You go girl  Well done you help many with your sharing heart. Love and light Mel nz
🌞💓🌼
so happy to see Vogue and Kendall do something that can have a tangible impact on the lives of many. Excited to see the other episodes.
Not being funny but I feel like we all suffer anxiety and it’s so dope to have a celebrity actually come out and talk about her issues
Omg I thought it was normal when u have all this stuff going on and started not to feel good and over whelmed . Well guys , I have anxiety 😳😳😓😓
I need her as my therapist <3
She is so similar to Kourtney
So many people now are dealing with anxiety!  Thank you for sharing.   I also think everything we are going thru this days doesn’t help.   Meditation helps me
A super interesting video : https://youtu.be/9ghlGW1Et8A About A documentary that made me think how lucky we should be to have a good life in peace.
Hi, mam you are looking nice👍
Thanks Kendall & such an important message.
Thanks to Kendall for being open and vulnerable! This is the side of her I'm glad she's showing to the world.  Dr. Ramani is beyond brilliant. She has a gift very few have.
im so happy that someone as influential as Kendall is exposing a vulnerability like this because it can help many other young people who follow her or stumble upon this video. Mental illnesses are still stigmatised, even though it has gotten much better than it used to be. Kudos to Kendall
I think Kendall is doing really well for being a young, privileged girl.  I was really impressed by her interview--she is being open and vulnerable, and it's hard to be natural on camera.  Much love and thank you for this beautiful interview.
My 17 year old daughter is dealing with this she used to be so cheerful :( ..... I’m trying my best to help her maybe we’ll watch this together today
#free palestine💔
Most scorpions and waters signs have one of the mental illnesses. (Scorpio, Pisces, Cancer)
kenny te queremos mucho
Dr. Ramini is the best. Kendall, you just met your doctor. Please follow up with her. She’s helped so many of us.
Notice how the doc puts in that she located in los Angeles and make sure she says that she  has a private practice. Kendall Jenner did. And her mood changed after that. Because she realized she is being used to plubize her business. It's all money.
I know, you're scrolling while listening
I self educated me on this topic so much as it is so hard to get a place at a therapist. I feel like this is on the rise (especially at the young generation) since our world is so globalized and fast paced....imo they should teach self care & meditation in schools. This is one of the most imporant tools you can learn.
Watching this I got a lot of insight about Kendall, and what I really can see is that just being in her family, like being a part of her family is what has made her have so much anxiety.  I used to watch their show and Kim has always been such a controlling person and very critical of her family members. And even recently in one of the episodes where Kim and Kourtney got in a physical fight, Kim made fun of Kendall having anxiety and she said that because of her anxiety that's why she was never reliable.  Also, if you really look at it, Kim has always been against therapy and so has Khloe. But Kourtney has been in therapy for years. And just looking at their lives, Kourtney is the only one who has good self-esteem and self-respect, unlike Khloe, and isn't so controlling and mean like Kim. And Kendall is very similar to Kourtney. Just my insight.
This is so soothing to hear ppl speak about these things that are just dragged under the carpet:)

$happy coin !!!!!
Great job  👏👍👌 it was very  helpful
This conversation help me to understand that I’m not the only one with anxiety 😥 I have been struggling with this since 2014 😔 this has affected my life so much. Kendall I hope you get better!
wow fax people need to tell the truth it's so important
Been dealing with this for 22 years
Dr Ramani !!!!! I know she’s the narcissist detecting queen 🤍🤍🤍
Biggest eye roll fckn possible 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Ty
YAS DR. RAMANI
Myself my channel is growing and treated and I have a child my side and my help
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE VIDEO OF HER AND HARRY
wow this helps alot as someone who struggles with social anxiety thank you, i also want to share that breathing techniques really help and relaxes ones mind when feeling like the anxiety is at its's worst
I’m here for Dr. Ramini! I am a stan - her channel helped me get through the pandemic 💜
I really recommend the book “the power of your subconscious mind” by Joseph Murphy. This book it’s awesome and you can see the reality of your thoughts affect your body
Drink a Pepsi, that might help😁👍🏼
this is the reason why i can't get mad at Kendall even after a lot of people accuse her of being rude or something. cause i feel the same way as her, i might come off as rude or snob to most people but that is how i feel more safe and somewhat comfortable. it is not easy to approach or socialize with people and if ever i push myself to not be "rude", i'll definitely die because of heart attack.
@vogue, thank you so much for this, I have never related to anything more and this video really answered questions I've wondered about since I was a child. I am so proud of Kendall opening up to this because so many people can relate to this and I hope she knows she is not alone. And I am like her and can never put my thoughts into words but this video was everything I needed. <33333333
This Is amazing
Very usefull. Thank you. GRACIAS
I love this therapist!
We love you 😘
People are usually surprised when I tell them Im very neurotic and anxious, because my anxiety mixed with my personality makes me super proactive. I make sure to be prepared for every possible situation. Downside to that is is very time consuming and mentally draining
Ramani seems a little nervous.  I hope she will stay the same, even when she is with all these celebrities.
just talking about anxiety makes me feel even more anxious and it sucks
Anxiety attacks Affects So Millions Of People In Our Country Sometimes People Don’t Understand You It’s Like Training your Mind And Escaping Away
She is the bravest human being I have ever seen, it must be atrocious to be a model with anxiety always in an airplane rushing to the next fashion show. I really hope she finds help.
Can we count how many time kendall Jenner said "Right"
cause you do not eat to impress others
Ramani should talk to Kanye west next
"Oh these people are uncomfortable because i'm so awkward".  Felt that . Been there . Thanks for this video !
Kendell now becoming more look alike of her sister Kim
This made me feel i'm not alone.
Thank you for this. I’m a licensed funeral director + I’ve been experiencing physical anxiety for quite some time!! Especially during Covid-19. Sometimes it’s gets so bad that I get sick to my stomach. I’m attempting to use my anxiety to help others. I’m on TikTok ( @hollisfuneralhome ) answering all the postmortem questions people dying to know...we’re all helping each other 💕☠️
Wow! It's weird. Then there was my counselor who was not even ready to accept that I have anxiety and used to ask me self-doubting questions.  That only made me more anxious and embarrassed. I stopped going to her.
i sometimes get anxiety by little things like if i bike alone on long bike route. Am i going to get hit by a car when i cross a busy intersection or will my legs cramp up and have to walk back lol. Crazy how anxiety can affect people in so many different levels.
Psychological bends - what a great term for explaining anxiety!!
I just noticed she was with Harry in the car at the start(when they were together)
This is the best video everrrr
Watch Kelly Borgan!!
Thank you so much for your explanation and solutions... Very helpful 🙏
she looks so much like kim now
well I have a job interview tommorow and this just came in suggestions....
I really respect and like Dr Ramani but considering she specialises in narcissism then sits down with a kar/jenner has really thrown me. Regardless I appreciate her helpful words and addressing mental health.
I have very bad anxiety and severe panic disorder and I feel for you Kendall it’s so debilitating and scary... mental health is real and we should all be sympathetic
Why is Kendall responding to everything? Mmmmh mmmmh right right yes yes right right...mhhhm...It's driving my OCD crazy...please just listen Ken
Everybody watching the video seriously while I'm replaying 1:10 just to confirm that that's Harry Styles in the car with her.
Hearing somebody talk about it makes me feel like I’m not alone
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Save Palestine!!
Amazing, I now have a new found respect for her
Western people  live in a bubble anything triggers them.. you think people who live under war and experience real struggle have time to deal with “ social anxiety.”
And in the moment you see Dr. Ramani Darsuvula 2:12 you just take this clip seriously ...that you just have hit the like and subscribe bottom. ¡Well done #Vogue!
Anxiety!!!! An.....xiety!!!! An.....xiety!!!!   Anxiety is something that change a positive feeling to negative feeling and what it leads later to a negative and downgraded response. Now what is our next step to handle anxiety is to try to take that magnifying glass and put it to being a regular lens.
Doctor Ramani. 🥰👋
This made me absolutely love Dr. Ramani Durvasula
There are different levels of anxiety. Someone anxious with insecurity is likely the one magnifying negative things. But with the right amount of anxiety, you can also think/plan ahead and eliminate possible obstacles that may come your way. It’s never black or white, either-or. The right blend always tastes great.
i do genuinely believe that she has anxiety and that she suffers but i feel like she did this only to gain popularity, because she saw how well ppl reacted to her being more 'open'. i think the part where she talks about how much she can relate to ppl feeling anxious over others not being responsible during covid show that she just wants to be relatable, and isnt truly honest bc she threw a massive party during lockdown
Kendall is really not the perfect person to interview people. Lack of lexical resources for talking.
Yaaay, Dr Ramani is the best!
Kendall the Bible says ...Be anxious for nothing!
Open minded every little thing's  Gonna be alright  Kendall jenner   And every legend very open minded
I would exchange my anxiety for physical pain 😭
Я так и не поняла, это было интервью кендал или этого психолога)
Anxiety is such a villain. I keep anxieting abt evthg, had to give up on my dream I worked for 3 yrs of my life just bc in the end I got anxious abt the future, whether I'd be good enough for the job n didn't get thr the final test.😣😞  Always wish I wasn't born this way!! Seeing others so relaxed n calm in d same situation 😞😞
This is how YouTube gets positive
Right
I just think it’s stupid that people actually share their whole life with the world like it’s ridiculous u can’t trust eney one stop sharing your life
Seems like talking about anxiety is giving her anxiety 😐
emmmm cant relate
An answer to all of this is Jesus Christ. Accept him as your lord and savior and be saved!! unless you come to life and the life giver you can never be happy!!
You and your family had massive INSENSITIVE PARTIES during the lockdown..  please dont pretend to "feel this" about the pandemic.. cant believe this is on vogue.  I hope your anxiety gets better though..that im sorry about
This was a very good interview highlighting anxiety. I appreciate the usable tips. Thank you, Dr. Ramani and Kendall.
A lot of y’all be anxious because you’re addicted to social media etc and subconsciously comparing yourself to every single person. Go within to find the real power and the anxiety will go away.
Keep it up hollywoods bleeding i guess
Hats off to Kendall for having the courage to represent all of us who struggle with social anxiety... The ‘introverts’ of the world thank you...❤️
Meh
Watching this triggers my panic attack idk why.... 😿
I'm so high rn lmao why am I here
Thank you Kendall......This is helping a lot of people that they can relate to you now....

People are seriously saying you can’t have mental health issues because a person is rich? Look at all the celebs that have overdosed/committed suicide.
i love how honest she is and knows how privileged and blessed she is
I love Dr. Ramani! 💚
Never had a normal childhood, constantly being filmed since early age. Thank you Mom.
link between gut health + anxiety is huuuuge yall
“Right, right, yeah, yeah” so distracting
Anxiety is such a real thing. It interferes so much with my day. This was great to listen to.
Kendall every 5 seconds: “mmm” “right” 🙄🙄
Very well put!!! Love everything she said
I have the same issues it's scary confusing&*sometimes I can't control it
Love love loveee this side of Kendall. This video was amazing excited for the rest of the series
You should do one with KIM, KOKO and KOURT separately . And probably Kylie too
She says that she is not editing her photos and saying girls like "ohh you gotta love yourself" bla bla bla but it is revealed that she is doing it. Actually i don't care about this girl cuz she is using her "power" in a bad way and shaking girls' confident by saying some things that she is even lying about
I wish she just listened all i herd was right mmmmm right crazzy, again dont use crazy thats anxietys cousin use the term correctly
Headaches and Dizzies are very common when you're in anxiety disorders... I felt that when I had panic attacks.
Right
Anxiety could be a super power I think she a empath
Do Ariana grande beauty secrets
THANK YOU KENDALL for being a voice for anxiety/panic disorders. You will help so many people feel like they are not alone. You are an amazing woman
I get it too
Isn’t anxiety a codependent trait? As well as a projection? Also, isn’t anxiety more of a trauma response?
6:02 So True
oh kendall💛✨ i feel u girl.
Dr Ramani deserves all the flowers! Been following her for about a year now!
Love this!!
《People with anxiety think yhat they are doing Judgeable things and that they are  making people uncomfortable by just being there》exactly what i experience.
Omg Dr Ramani ❤❤ long time watcher of her here 🤗
You do too much evil to Selena and that a part of your anxiety ,you are the devil
clicked because of dr rahmani.
dr rahmani!!!!! vogue!!!! amazing collab. here for ramani lol!!!
thank you for opening up girl! mental health does not discriminate!
People are starving .
I have social anxiety. Panic attacks, tears, a hypochondriac... so I can relate. When I tell people this, they don’t believe me because I am outgoing.
As someone who has suffered with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Health Anxiety (hypochondria) for 10+ years this hit the nail on the head. I'm so glad someone with as big of a following as Kendall is talking about this so openly and making it less stigmatised. It's horrendous to live with but hopefully more and more people understand that it is debilitating sometimes. The physical symptoms can be just as bad a lot of the time and we all need to recognise it for the illness that it is.   Great job Vogue & Kendall!
Excess caffeine can cause anxiety when paired with stress. We love coffee in America.
LOVE THIS THANKYIU KENDALL!
I honestly have always loved how she talks, it's so calming.
Dr. Ramani is a Rockstar
so happy to see dr ramani getting more recognition!!! 🥺❤️✨
Great upload! They should teach the importance of mental health in schools. Keep it up!
Anxiety is like your little baby 👶 the more you feed it the bigger it gets
Panic attacks, panic and anxiety disorder is scary! You’re constantly worried about everything, your health, your body. It’s a magnifying glass to everything bad. To every sensation. lol sometimes I feel like getting checked out for heart issues or something. Good luck out there guys and take care of yourself! I live a healthy lifestyle but Stress is the hardest part!

YES! Dr. Ramani! Such an amazing woman!!!!!
why do you put this smoothing filter on her? her skin looks so fake and edited.
Kendall: “RIGHT”
Just watching this gave me anxiety 😬
Proud of Kenny
Omg thank you soooo much Kendall! We needed someone with this huge platform to talk about anxiety as it’s the modern day (present) depression
im so happy that someone that is famous and a huge role model to so many is speaking out about anxiety, its honestly a relief.
Relevant content, not superficial - I like it
I now look at Kendall differently, I appreciate that she spoke about this <3
No
why the weird montage? felt like a doc..... Vogue you can do better.
Dr Ramani got my attention that I clicked on the video!
at the beginin I thought she was going to say "my name is candle"
Anxiety is a monster and you have to handle it.
She’s so fortunate to be able to get professional help so many people are on a waiting list for help
You’re not in tune if you can’t control the aniexty. I’m trying to get more in tune with dealing with the anxiety being an empath trying to acknowledge my gifts fro God. It’s a great gift but if we don’t get chakras in-line to be in tune it feels like a curse. Bless you have a great day
Thank you so much,we need more stuff like this.
These answered many questions to me
I love her even more for this. Ty for being brave enough to share. Its deeply appreciated.
I guess the therapist more suffer than Kendall 😂
I hope there is someone like Dr Ramani near me so i can get a session with her. There isn't really much help for mental issues here🥺
Heavier make up please yes queen kendall
She looks gorgeous with that make up style
Kendall, you are correct. There can be a significant physiological component to anxiety. In 2008 NIH committed approximately 110 million dollars to the human microbiome project, which has since established a direct link to the gut and how it affects thought, emotion, and behavior and a wide array of diseases. This is why we measure 17 psychometrics at every session and consider our gut health instruments to be the 18th psychometric.
I think the other way around. I think being famous puts u at a higher chance of getting anxiety.
Watching her interview I kinda like her. My favorite Kardashian
And Dr Ramini did a wonderful job and thank you for your expertise !
I would really love for Dr. Ramani to go more into Hypochondria… I definitely suffer, on some level, of this and it’s incredibly hard to deal with.
That was the best episode that Vogue has ever produced on this platform. I think we enjoy more watching programs like this than looking at bags and clothes. Anyway thank you Vogue team to put this concept into nice and very informative video. And Kendal, we Thank you too!
lol at Kendall saying she's a hypochondriac... didn't she have a big birthday party in the middle of a pandemic?
👏🏽👏🏽
Tf is this
I knew of Doctor Ramani before this video she’s very thoughtful and seems to know extensively .... about all of these topics 👌
Omfg just listen Kendall. I can't even hear the psychologist.
It’s kinda feels good to learn and lesson.!!
Goshh I hate anxiety.. I have social anxiety tho.. sometimes I feel like people don’t get what it can do with a person. If you’re reading this whether you have anxiety or not I want you to know that you’re not alone! ❤️
social anxiety for almost 9 years now.. it’s been rough but i definitely learned a lot about the world and my body 🥺❤️
Poor little rich girl. Get over yourself Kendall Jenner
Hey Vogue in the next episode could you tell the guests to stop with the fillers/ad-libs. Kendall won’t stop saying right, right, right or yea,yea....
I have been told that mentally reharsing prior to the situation or event is a "safety-behaviour" that is kind of not good for people with anxiety.
Anxiety is so mentally and emotionally debilitating. In 2012 I had a panic attack for the first time, and I thought I was going to die. I was medicated and was having 4-5 panic attacks a day. After two years I decided I wanted better for myself as well as my family who were being impacted when I'd have panic attacks. I started using coping skills and  stopped taking meds. I then recognized I wanted to help others with and went to graduated school to obtain my Masters. Although my experience was debilitating and challenging, it allotted me the knowledge/tools to help others.
This is really interesting, helpful tips for during and after Covid
The fact that this was published the EXACT SAME DAY I decided to tell my parents about my struggles with social anxiety... LIKE, WTF- THE TIMING??? I'm glad I found this video
Kenner Jenner having anxiety or ANY mental disorder just being HUMAN, on top of being in the family she has, and then being in the most extreme and JUDGY industry as a career ....😒😒😒 is like asking if water is wet! 🤷🏽‍♀️ #ItIsWhatItIs!
I love this. Thank you
She just explained my whole life
I find it difficult that’s she putting so much emphasis on “real” anxiety. And how people are using the term lightly. Sometimes people who are casually dropping the term “anxiety” are actually going through a lot but don’t feel comfortable enough having a serious conversation about it and exposing themselves too much. So they kind a of joke about it. Never judge a person on what you think they are going through, because you just don’t know. I found the Doctors POV very helpful though.
The truth that most influencers and celebrities experiencing social anxiety.
She's a reality star& model I find it hard to believe. The K's are witches! As a Mom why would you keep your kids in tv if they are having problems.  No just keep filming we have to be popular& rich so just stuck it up! I'm married to a trans man let's keep filming we have to be popular& rich.
she seems so sweet and calm in this interview 🥺
I didn't feel she was open. That's understandable.
I suffer of clínica anxiety and if I go to a party I have to know is who is going, how many people are going and so many details and I thought i was over controlling but after hearing what the therapist said as a tip when going to gathering to as some of those details to rehears i realized is that I was protecting my self of a a diary attach and this is the reason I’ve never liked surprised parties for me.  It’s good to know the fit wasn’t about controlling, yes but in a survival mode and not as jerk
I may be stupid and narrow mind person....but I want to ask questions..?why these celebrities open up on everything ..?why they choose to open their personal problems in social media..?it is really toxic...sry for my bad english..
She doesn't have much anxiety when she is back stubbing or b***tching about people
Dr.Ramani 💟
The fact that they added harry in this video
As a psychology student, this kind of conversation makes me happy. Seeing people in the big industry talk about mental health is one of the best ways to show to people that mental illness is true and not just an imagination.
Facts. My anxiety trigger is LARGE crowd and people lying to me.
Harry baby 😍
Buena noche de José te deseo lo mejor dedicarme algo saludos a todos y que te vaya bien José saludos a todos America
Kendal doesn’t need to respond to every word, she can just listen.
I like your idea. Keep it up
I can relate this is so true.❤️
👍🏾
Thank you Kendall and Doctor , i feel better a little bit when i saw this talking 🤍🤍🙏🏻🗽
This was so helpful♥️
I really love this.
Sounds like kendall is an introvert and just needs her alone time to space out without being judged for it
I don't wish her ill health or anything but if you know you have these issues well don't be in the public eye for one. Working in the modelling industry probably isnt a good idea or being part of reality shows. Get a job that reflects your true self and don't force yourself into certain social situations if you're not comfortable with it.
I thought this was gonna be a proactive solution commercial. Guess not
I don't like the Kar/jenners. They're not good people, BUT I'm glad vogue is shedding a light on big celebrities who do struggle with mental issues. I'm glad it's becoming something that we can sit down and have an open discussion about instead of people treating it as if it doesn't exist or it's an over exaggeration
There’s literally children being murdered and starving tO death but we are here talking about Kendall jenners “anxiety”.  POOR LITTLE THING MY GOD GET OVER URSELF JEEEEEEZ
I wish Arabic or french Subs were available so that I can share the link with my father & friends, that would help me greatly . they don't really understand 😫some think i'm a maniac, crazy..... i'm labeled as the overthinker / OCD one in the group . it's so much more than that .
I'm exactly her,. Panic attacks 20 plus yrs. Sux
I love you for this. Keep it coming <3
It is also helping the people who r watching
I was ready to criticize her, but I can relate to going to the hospital because you think your heart is failing along with the numbness and other physical manifestations of anxiety. It’s hard to not conflate those manifestations with actual cardiovascular issues because that’s what they feel like.
beautifull
1:11 HELLO HARRY
Dr. Ramni is the narcissistic personality disorder expert... I wonder what she things of Kendall’s whole family
Wtf YouTube, why would you recommend anything related to this ridiculous egotistical narcissist family. Thumbs DOWN
If this young generation stop using the phone will be different.  Plus this famous people I dont really belive ,,, because they got pay to say so many things that later will be promoting a pill or a treatment or medicine thats the goal of it,,,,,, this is the new life,,, this goverment whant to make young belive on this kind of things ,,, so they dont grow up normal Our generation is so different. Because we didnt have telephone compitation social media. Bulling social media and we were enjoying ourself completly,,,, what on a earth this model is talking about,,, thats is dangeous for a young kids She has alll what a young girl is dreaming ,,, so unreal ,  stop using or being adictive of the social media and phone and relax.  And I forget plastic surgery.  That will give you all anxiaty Try to be simple live simple and est simple to remember hsppiness is in those simple things
8:27  Even though the lady was talking about neurosism system among others, she's made it of herself
thank you Kendall, thank you Vogue.
Love how shes recognizing her privileges
Omg! Doctor Ramani, I love you! God bless.
I love her for normalising anxiety - she’s queen 👑
💗
Someone give her a Pepsi.
You should be poor and ugly and have anxiety .....
She’s so pretty that my anxiety is at 0%
I can understand because I’ve lived it
Proud of her! This is going to help many people.
love kendall and really happy to see her open up about her mental health situations.  anxiety sucks but whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger.  Thankyou KJ.  peace
and drink a glass of water.. not sure why but it seems to help alot for me :)
Makes me think back to that video manny mua posted about how awkward it was when he met and sat with Kendall. This video alone kind of puts it into perspective of why she comes off the way that she does.
I was diagnosed with anxiety in 2008, I thought I was having a heart attack. I am on medication, but still I still get really bad chest pain if I feel stressed.
"I feel this" you literally had parties during the lockdown
Absolutely love this Dr I’m subscribed to her on YouTube. I love the way she explains I’m such detail
She had a huge birthday party during covid and says she's been super isolated... sure
Bruhh try living life underprivileged 🤣🤣 " Anxiety" ya 😂😂😂👏👏👏 Man rich people live in there own funnel view, so condescending always.
Has she put on weight? Her cheeks seem fuller. She looks sooo great!
wow, i relate to kendall so much more than I thought I could. i was that person saying, what does she have to be anxious over, but I know there would be someone saying that about me, and then someone saying that about that someone—as she said, we all have "one of these" --> points to pesky, little overactive brain. we need to be so much more compassionate with ourselves.
What is important about Kendall is that she is able to understand and express her feelings and that is  also helpful to speed up healing . A problem shared, is a problem halfway to healing.
i was severly bullied growing up, and that made it so everyday on the way to school i would feel very anxious. Once we got close to the school i would start feeling this anxiety more and more to the point where almost every morning i would feeling incredibly ill and emotional and start crying since i hated going to school because of my anxieties. so thanks for this Kendall! its nice to know im not alone.
Ok but why is no one speaking about the part of the loved one who is not being conscious during covid . She said " I feel this” when she literally did a party for Halloween with no masks and no social distance. Make it make sense.
Kendall looks the most like her mom than her other siblings
❤️❤️❤️❤️
my darl
harrryyy 😍🤷‍♀️
Kendall’s anxiety is pretty public. 🙄 But she is  indeed a very beautiful woman and hopefully can find her way through it!
The mindfulness book "30 Days to Reduce Anxiety" by Harper Daniels has good meditation exercises to practice.
This literally helped me so much I can't explain.  Really thanks a lot.
omg salfok harry 😭🖤
To everyone asking what can Kendall Jenner be anxious about, here are few things I’d be anxious about if I was in her position! : 1 being famous and everyone knowing me and coming up to me and talking to me 2 what I look like constantly  3 flying all around the world  4 stalkers 5 my private information becoming public knowledge 6 if my friends are actually my friends or people using me
Thanks a lot for sharing this 😊❤️
SO PROUD OF YOU KENDALL FOR TAKING THIS STEP TO SHARE YOUR STORY AND USING THIS PLATFORM.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO SHOW COMPASSION AND LOVE.  THERE IS SOMEONE FIGHTING A BATTLE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. BE KIND.
A great tip I learned along the way Is when I’m feeling too much wash my hands in cold water and if I’m feeling empty/numb wash my hands in warm water! It really helps settle the nerves in ur body!
Thank you for opening up. I love that she acknowledged her privilege but also her humanness. She's human just like you and me. Join for #mentalhealthmondays on my IG account @heathersavonne
Thanks Kenny, you're not alone.
Dr. Ramani is just so addicting to listen to☺️
God
This was boring!there wasn't anything new!l knew all of this! I've heard all of this before!
You can’t control anxiety, ppl with anxiety sometimes can’t really control of how they act especially in public, and that’s why ppl think they are being rude, when in reality they just can’t control it. I’m glad Kendal opened up about it, it makes me feel a little less lonely.
can’t wait for the next episode!
Kendall is me and I am Kendall. I had a few months that I couldn’t get off the couch. I considered going to the hospital every night. I felt sick in the head and helpless. To know others deal with the same thing makes me hopeful. Hopeful that they can figure out how to overcome it so I can too.
Thankyou Vogue. This initiative is much appreciated
FREE PALESTINE 🇵🇸
Yasss Dr. Ramini!  They sent a pro in Narcissistic personality disorder to deal with a Kardashian. The here shade is epic!!
Anxiety/Fear Is not Of Holy God. It's a Lie of the enemy I pray that Kendall find Salvation and peace in Christ he can only heal because he truly loves her.
Proud of Dr Ramani! She is the best.
Kendall reminds me of Khloé here (no “as if they were sisters” comments pls)
Mental illness and Wealth has nothing to do with each other !
Right!
Yooooo. This girl is goooooorgeous
I am so anxious myself, this really help because I didn't understood before
Thanking Vogue here.
Literally even my family members think im so sure of myself that is why i feel better than anyone else and act rude to other people. I swear I don't. There is nothing more hurtful to me when people say I'm rude to them when I don't say anything or try to hide at gatherings. I don't like to talk, I don't like to be in the centre of attention and I don't like to be judged. Can we just respect other people's mental health and let them (us) be?
Exactly, it can be a super power, channel the energy into something 👏🏻
Wow that’s kinda scary, literally every example the Dr gave I know has happened to me and does happen to me wth, I knew I was anxious and an introvert but I didn’t even realise most of these things weren’t normal 😬😬
Brilliant idea to make this series vogue
Hmmm..... But I thought she is not a type of "model" who does 30 show a  Week and doesn't overwork herself
this really helped me understand anxiety more
Love Kendall ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Never tought I would have so much in common with Kendall. I have never linked my kinda hypocondriac personality to my anxiety. This video is so clarifying and I will definitely try to prepare more, be on time and make others comfortable. Thank you!!!
the audacity
Anxiety and social anxiety really sucks. It doesn't matter where you are on the social ladder, this is a psychodynamic issue for the individual. I applaud Ms. Jenner for coming forward and telling her story. May is mental health awareness month, but awareness and discussion shouldn't just be limited to this month.
Thank you for so much interesting info and views. Very good content!
7:20 "wow I feel this" kendall you threw a party with a lot of people when we didn't had the vaccine yet
I m dealing with anxiety all these years I m. Thankful for the advice and sharing
I appreciate vogue and Kendall for this. Thank you ✨
Kendall jenner our queen of runway
I really really love this series but is anyone else just wanting to hear the doctor talk more? I feel Kendal keeps agreeing to everything isn’t really letting the conversation flow, just a thought, love the series though!
Shes’s claiming she has “social anxiety” around her friends but threw a massive party during the peak of Covid. I didn’t know risking people’s lives was a symptom of anxiety.
The title should be "Anxiety with Dr. Ramani and Kendall Jenner"
One more reason to love her
Am i the only one thinking she's pregnant and kinda hiding it? Idk ..
Iloveyou, kendal!!!!🤍♥️
As someone with ongoing, severe and unbearable health and mental issues yet totally dismissed by mental health professionals and doctors here in England . I have physical manifestations of stress and anxiety. Yes she is very privileged. And I find this unhelpful and insulting. They can easily access support and other fortunes. I cannot. She doesn't have any reason to complain. She has choice.
Love Dr. Ramani. Didn’t know she is a therapist to the famous.
Big ups to Dr. Ramani here!
Once upon a time It was the anxiety that made us survive ✨✨✨✨✨✨🌼🌼💫💫💫
this is honestly a great video
Dr. Ramini is definitely top notch!!
It happens to me all the time like, I struggle with small talk like I get nervous and don't know what to say. So people think that I am rude and a mean person. Like seriously!!
Thank you, Kendall
such a hypocrite. did you have a party during covid?
What is going wrong with this society?
Ok I’m crying
I am struggling with this too
whenever my anxiety attacks i ;  • excessively sweat to the point where i smell too much and i hate it.  • delay / shortness of breath.  • feels dizzy and uncomfy. my shoulders are always heavy and not eased down.  • i feel like everyone is looking at me and judging me.  • negative thoughts like how i used to be called ugly or judged very often comes back up to my mind.  • i feel like dying at that very moment.   _- seriously, anxiety isn't a joke. several people who'd chosen to do suicide had to suffer the same thing. may we all heal together and make the best out of life finally unbothered. remember_ *you're not alone.* ♡
Hundreds of Palestinians are on the verge of being kicked out of their homes by the Israeli government, with the help of U.S. taxpayer  #StopJerusalemExpulsions and #SaveSheikhJarrah.
it gives me less anxiety when I knew that like a people like Kendall  experiencing that same situation that give her anxiety same as mine, and it gives me realizations that "oh she's rich and have all of things , but she's have anxiety" in that realization it helps I'm not the only one whose have anxiety :)
Thank you kendall
She looks weird
I would love to help Kendall release these past life traumas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbOqTJ_ImRI
Yess Dr Ramani is a vogue girl now she’s the moment
I do understand what she feels , because sometimes people think that i’m rude and very quiet because of my social anxiety. When you feel that ,,small” all the time, its really hard to get along with other people.
Thank you so much for coming up with this issue... People always confuse the term depression with the anxiety... I have always suffered this kind of anxiety attack throughout my life... Never understood that it was anxiety... Always confused with depression... This vdo has opened my eyes... Lots of good wishes Kendall... You are such a strong soul with good heart...
i hope everyone watching this video realizes they're using a beauty filter on her skin. you can see the blurred effect. pls dont compare yourself !!
I have anxiety of being judged..not on how i look or present myself...it's being judged by other people 😘❤❤
So helpful thank you xo
I do a lot for my mum and no matter how many times I tell her that her making us late spikes my anxiety, she does not listen.  By the time I arrive I feels distressed, flustered and panicky and my mother feels I am overeacting no matter how many times I telk her that it heightens my symptoms.   I recognised that arriving late for an event is one of my triggers, and it's nice to have this confirmed as a recognised by those well versed in anxiety disorders.
I’ve seen her and Kylie say a million times on the show that someone is giving them anxiety, she’s such a hypocrite
This makes me so mad about how the tiktok girl commented on her being really rude like girl you don’t her personally how could you comment such things about a person who has really bad social anxiety I hate that waiter so much
I didn't even know all this. I thought I had a little bit anxiety but like I didn't know the symptons. I mostly have a racing heart and a quickening of breath also I have the mindset of people judging me but that is lessing I'm working on that one. Kind of happy to have seen this video.
My pulse rate gets 140 every time i am at the doctors clinic. I really don't like being out and have minimal friends whom i talk with occasionally. My hand shivers everytime i speak to someone new.. or say something .. Am i anxious?
Dr. Ramani is the best ❤
Narcs
Sadly I can relate to all this
Only people whom I like in K fam is Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian.
Would be nice if Kendall would let her talk. 😩
it’s worse dealing with anxiety as a celebrity as you get big amounts off paparazzi forming around you and take pictures 24/7 and shouting you’re name so it’s probably the most scariest thing going through generally but bless her 🥺
she is the youngest person i know who found what she is really born to do and that's modelling and with no hesitation she did it.
I have sleep paralysis and I'm a medium but this girl has generations of blood lines that have brought her here and are keeping her energetically trapped I hope she can find a way out of her lucifarian upbringing !
I’m going through an anxious/ depressive phase right now. It’s never been this bad. Everything in life is ok right now. But I wake up anxious, sick, can’t do anything or even keep food down. I have to kind of sit it out until noon and I start feeling better. Same thing has been happening for a week now. It’s so hard. It’s a difficult fight.
❤❤❤
I just cannot relate to this woman having anxiety. She has access to all the top therapists, Doctors, etc The average person can't. So, sorry not sorry but not giving a f ....
Me being excitedly in the same frequency as my gossip friend: 5:52
didnt she throw a massive party during the pandemic lmao and btw anxiety doesnt excuse being rude af to other people
Dr Ramani ❤️
As a person who struggles with anxiety everyday of my life, Kendall I hear you, completely. Thanks for giving this topic a voice.
She is a hypocrite! If Trump is a narcissist what are the Kardashians dr. Romney is a sell out and a terrible person, I'm so dissatisfied. This video literally expect everything that I've done including personal psychology classes. Im back to square one :(
what is anxiety? sorry im only 12 hehe
how to know if i have anxiety?
This is why I love Kendall she has a beautiful heart ♥️ and is here for us beautiful kings and queens
Imo, i feel like celebrities like herself, artists, etc had somewhat glorified having anxiety and gaslight it, which is a shame and makes it hard to feel bad or sympathize with her “anxiety” situations....
I love Dr.Ramani, she has helped me so much. Glad to see her here.
"OMG im such a hypocondriact
I clicked for Dr Ramani
Pray to God. To cast out all anxiety and fear.

Here for Dr Ramani 😍
Many people are definetely going to feel sorry for a person born with a golden spoon when they open up about their anxiety & mental health issues.
The root of all anxiety is a disconnection with our true nature, our soul being. How? By wearing a false persona which began when we were socially conditioned as children
I always feel this kind of thing
In conclusion Kendall only feels anxiety when she has to deal with the "commoners", because when she made a birthday party in the middle of the pandemic with celebrities she did not feel anxiety. And also only acts rude to "commoners" and celebrities as gods.
Proud of this queen!
Proud of you kenny❤️
it makes me so glad that kendall is bringing attention to this. this can help so many people, as it has helped me. hopefully this will spark more conversations surrounding this topic for a wider audience. thank you kendall, Dr. Ramani, and vogue.
"Literally"..you are talking about it ..so it's literal.
Struggling with anxiety, it's so painful
This is exactly what I’ve been trying to tell people, that what if the reason why kendall doesnt talk much or interact with a lot of people in the public is because of her anxiety. A lot of people instantly think she’s rude for not being able to talk much but so many of us do the same thing. It’s just sad how much hate she gets over that, knowing it’s a very normal thing esp for introverts and ppl who have social anxiety.
I'm scared, we have the same reactions
Dr. Ramani is such a boss. Love her.
https://youtu.be/TjYZLX1pdf0
Is Dr. Ramani an Indian origin women?
You've got to be kidding me. This is a joke and it's NOT funny. If she had social anxiety she wouldn't be putting it online.
Can someone please tell how it feels to be like when you have anxiety
When she talked about getting used to the solitary lifestyle in quarantine and alot of the expectations were gone; Then following that with saying going back into social situations now gives her anxiety I felt that immensely. I've been experiencing that myself lately and it's truly frustrating
She comes off so vapid. I don't think she's ever said a single genuinely funny thing in her life.
Dr. Ramani!!! <3
Mm
Right
Kendall mood : Rigth😃
Dr. Ramani making it big! Vogue! U go girl!
Kendall you are so relatable I have GAD as well and its getting worse because of this fcking pandemic :(
Kenny 💕
Right...right...right ...yeah yeah yeah...right...hmm...right...right...right.yeah. WOW
Calling it shortness of breath and the hospital story made accuracy on anxiety in mainstream media because of Kendall...
Kendall’s my favorite honestly. She always stuck to being herself ❤️
Honestly the psychologist gives me anxiety. Like how she kinda push an agreement and understanding is a little intimidating and she doesn't stop talking
My Kendall ❤️
Kendalll is a queeeennn
Proud of this girl
The mental rehearsing for every situation I’m going to be in socially is something I’ve done since I was a little girl and it can be so exhausting but it is worth it
I love Doctor Ramani
🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍
wiiiiild
the intro with all the sounds gave me so much anxiety, because there was so much going on with the sounds, but the rest of the video was a great insight!!:)
In desi culture if you don't talk you're straight up considered poorly mannered or rude :(
Were same kendall i keep fighting my anxiety until now 😇💪🏻
I need this Doctor in my life.
Dr Ramani 🙏🏼
Wooowwww 4:47 is me!!! I always feel people just hate me think I’m weird like I just don’t belong
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I still wish Dr. Ramani was my doctor.
Stress brings out more anxiety! When you have continuous panic attacks, like I have in my life, it leads to isolation and depression; ie avoiding places and situations where you have had panic attacks. I thank my psychiatrists every day for helping me live a better life!
thanks vogue for this..
Dr. Ramani😍♥️♥️♥️
I have anxiety I feel panic and nervous and hypochondriac too... I'm young and beautiful but I have Kendall Jenner symptoms! 🤔
She really looks like Kylie here
Her saying "right" every 5 seconds is driving me insane
Good for her for speaking out about anxiety!
Kendall tus ojos son los más bellos!!
I don’t care and don’t think any of these people deserve their fame for being infamous! This sick society is because of people like this‼️
I have social anxiety and just closed my self for like 5 months , and tomorrow I have a very important presentation where I have to talk in front of many persons ! This helped me alots , it's like the universe send it to me ❤
She just explained my problem
2:46 You can tell for the psychologist  it was so hard to be serious with her . Keeping your face serious was hard here wasn’t it ;)
Dr. Ramani 🙌🏻❤️
And this is why we should always be kind to one another. No one ever knows what’s going on inside. 💜
I love Dr. Ramani. I'm so glad her career is growing. She's such a good presenter and psychologist.
ok great message but also why the school photo pic background lmaooooooooooo
thank you vogue helped me a lot 😊
I’m such a hypochondriac as well 😖
wait you’re telling me that these things aren’t just be being socially introverted?
Great video. I just felt like Kendall is still not open to conversing about her anxiety. Also, she looks like her younger self in this video.
Read quran on people who feel un confortible and Blows them down after that . That make confortible the prophet said quran it is confortible for human. we read quran on people who dont feel comfortable in our country that help people and i like read quran on my family for make them feel better when they get angry or anything 😊
I'm a psychology student and watched with a smile on my face. I should to say that thank you Kendall for really encouraging people and for pointing out how important is this
yes i love this
Thank you Kendall for speaking out and opening up about anxiety. Because I have gone through this. Especially the rushing to the hospital part and my family think i was crazy.
Booooohooo.. I have so much money and my life is millions times better than thousands of people, but my life sucks sooo bad i have anxiety....Poor Kendall..
Please make it a series.  Love this so much . ❤
Learnt so much in 11 mins and 37 seconds
This was informative thank you
remember when she threw a party in the middle of a pandemic? yea me too
love that Kendall has spoken about this openly 🧡
I get it
❤️❤️❤️
Wow
Really appreciated this!
the family that has given millions of people body dysmorphia and anxiety gets a show about it?wtf
Kendall is having anxiety because she knows she is famous for her sister's patch on the internet.
Wish we can see more of this side of her. Vulnerable, relatable and kind.🙏🏾
Thank you❤
She’s soo pretty omg
I love dr ramani
Love this! Just shared on FB.   all the best ☀️🌻🐝🦋
Thank you for putting this out there!
We understand you Kendall. Been suffering since I was a kid. One day at a time 💜💜
Super proud of u Kendal ❤️
WHY IS THERE A VIDEO IF HARRY AND HER IN THIS OMG
i spot harold
I love this.
Having no money and having anxiety is not the best combo there is
في عربي هون ؟😂
i need more of these Vogue
She’s already had like 5 obsessed stalkers try and break into her house. I couldn’t sleep at night
I came here for Dr. Ramani....
So happy that this conversation is taking place. Love this Doctor. I can relate to every single symptom explained in this video. I feel overwhelmed when I interact with more than what i’m use to during the pandemic. I thought I was the only one.
Got mad ghey towards the end. We all wash our hands & clean our houses so wearing a dirty mask would be highly unhygienic considering what you mentioned. Good day to you
take care
The only way you can achieve peace is through JESUS CHRIST. Nothing else can give you peace.
please don't say God's name in vain
not the first clip with Harry 😭
Absolutely love the way kendall talked about her anxiety. She brought a professional to come in and give her and the audience prespective. I have clinical anxiety that had gotten to the point of it interrupting my life and can relate to her 100%, I know she doesn't want a pity party, but I do give my sympathy and positive vibes she will get through it no pity involved just empathy and understanding. Love this talk ❤
bro she’s opened about her anxiety 5000 times, like we all go through anxiety
why is this dr talking to me direct
She had her lips done too smh
Anxiety isn’t a real illness she is such a faker and plays the victim
I totally understand her. I have social and health anxiety and it’s the worse I start thinking that I’m javelin ya heart attach or stoke, and that juts make it worse 3-4 weeks ago my whole body went numb
Dr. Ramani is the best.
*İ don't believe her sincerity* seems like a show to me I'm sorry
Wait, Dr. Ramani is an expert in narcissism. Someone needs to ask her if she detected narcissistic traits in Kendall.
I don’t know how you go through what Kendall has been through and not have an anxiety disorder. I’m glad she’s speaking out 💜
thats SO important, im very thankful for this ❤️
Panic attacks really really stink. I feel her struggle! Ugh I always think I’m going to die when I have a panic attack!  I’m a hypochondriac too. Lmao always think something is wrong!
I know the struggle having anxiety sucks!!!! This was very informative thank you!! 🙏🏻
OMG it’s trending
This is brilliant. Thank you, Kendall.
I love how it’s raising awareness
I am OBSESSED with Kendall
Great for Kendall to share, however I feel like the psychologist is talking most of the time and could listen to what Kendall has to say or share her experiences, then give her better and specific advice.
Congratulations and well done Dr Ramani 💗🙌🏽
This made me feel so much better. I needed this 😫😫
She has anxiety because her mom is a narcissist.
She's a millionare, who cares.
Надеюсь это видео переведут до конца следующего года @vogue russia
I love Dr. Ramani!
1 Peter 5:7 “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.”  For me, praying to God and meditating on His presence and gentle Word helps me a lot, whenever anxiety seems to appear out of nowhere. I remember how Jesus is really there for me. 🙏🏾 this video is really bringing awareness,and people suffering in silence with their own thoughts. Mental health is wealth ✨🙌🏾 God wants the best for you, the greatest peace that you could never find in this world.
In all honesty anxiety is a terrible thing to have seriously! I cant do a lot of things because of it!
What a great connection they had.  This was great!
Ιn my opinion Kendall in your age you have to stay alone. You should have your own house your own life after you have managed to have most of all of them... This is my opinion as I am student in Psychology.
wtf are people hating on her because she is privileged. There are always people who have it worse no matter who you are or what situation you are in but that doesn’t mean that your situation doesn’t matter. Yes, she is privileged but that doesn’t mean she doesn’t have human feelings like anxiety, especially because she has been in the spotlight her whole life. You guys are just jealous.
I admire Kendall for already opening up. But I believe that we should really acknowledge having anxiety but we dont stay in that dark area. It's all a process.
1:11  Harry styles?
1:10 she’s with Harry!!
I’m so proud of Kenny!!!! I love you gurl ❤️✨
Dr Ramani is always on the ball ❤️
No lie. It's really difficult to harbour compassion towards someone so privlidged and tone deaf.
10:14 when she describes conversation as a “dance” puts such a positive light on it! it’s helpful and fun to think about it that way:) well put!  -someone with social anxiety
Kendall. So proud of you.
Marijuana helps me a lot
having anxiety and being a hypochondriac is horribleeeeeee
You said it yourself you live a privilege life what do you have to worry about???😂😂😂😂
kendall look so much like kim, omg!!!
I clicked on this thinking I would roll my eyes at her but I actually rly vibe with what she said and respect her
Thanks a lot. I just needed this.... I had an anxiety attack few days ago this will be helpful to prepare myself for any such issues in future....👍
Mhhhhh okaayyy naahhh it's nothing
thank you for talking about this!!! it is a very important topic
Wah. Wah. Wah. Cry me a river.
Nah this chick is lame af
I have massive anxiety and the thought of being famous and doing fashion shows MUST cause Kendall A LOT of anxiety! So many commitments and obligations, plus the paparazzi and etc. I don't understand how people could think she doesn't have a reason to have panic attacks. Even if she wasn't "Kendall Jenner" she is still a human being!!
THE HYPOCRISY OF HER TALKING ABOUT COVID WHEN SHE LITERALLY THREW A PARTY IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. LOL
I NEEDED THIS
IF YOU GET ANXIETY THEN JUST QUIT OR GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK. THE PROBLEM WITH YOU IS JUST... YOU CHOSE MONEY OVER PEACE OF MIND. NOT JUST YOU BUT YOUR WHOLE FAMILY. LOL. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO THE BEST THERAPIST.
This is an informative public service.  Thanks, Vogue.
Thank you so much Kendall and Vogue, for shining a light on mental health!
Thank you Kendall
shout out to everybody with social anxiety, i kinda feel bad for you
This has given so many words to things that I haven't express yet. Thanks Vogue for giving me tools to live a better life.
she kinda looks like kim here
This was far too short 😭
Dr. Ramani Yessss, always the best, thank you
this girl blames everything on her anxiety lmaoo
everyone slamming her for throwing a party🤡🤡 i would've thrown a bigger one😈
Thank you for sharing your story ❤️
Is a very beautiful helpful info❤️
Right right right right right right right
Every celebrity has anxiety:)))
I love this
I love dr.R
to everyone saying she doesn't have the right to have anxiety and therefore empathy because of her background; anxiety is not exclusive to the under-privileged.
wow this was so well done!! proud of you Kendall! this really helped me <3
I'm here because of Dr. Ramani. Been, seen and I gotta say: Dra Ramani is way more interesting than Kendall. I have never understood why America is so obsessed with that narcissistic family.
Thanks for sharing. Very helpful
She have anxiety but she is so brave if she shading other artist / people hmmm... taylor. And people stay love her she didn’t have to apologise wtf people have favoritism.
I fight Depression, Anxiety, Ptsd and Ocd daily.  ***comment your mental illness ***  And remember, you're a warrior!♡
You need to pray because all these time God can and will help us. He knows what we are dealing with, sadness, happiness, anxieties, our true state, He knows it all.  I know others may not believe, but we can't hide that this is the truth. Let's come to God, God is with us and If we come close to God, He will come closer to us. Seek, pray, trust and rely all to God, He loves us. God Bless whoever reads this and also to those who don't read it! You're going to be okay kendall and those who have anxieties as well, I'll pray for you.
Wahhhhhhh 😣
Totally relatable with the whole wanting to stay in and not going out, afraid of being judged, always thinking best to be on time and make others wait. Danggg 😞
Take dr chase nerves tablet also cut out sugar, please check out maca root, ashwagandha,  google how your feeling
Meh.. just cover it with plastic, like any other Kardashian do
Anxiety can be good, however it can have a negative effect in your life, I was Agoraphobic for 27years 😔, still have issues with long distance but out of the bloody house.... glad celebrities are being candid about this growing condition. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 thank you Kendall.
Kendal was always my favorite of the Kardashian-Jenners. Not because of her anxiety, but because of how real and grounded she seems. She is literally such an amazing pearson
She literally says “right, yeah, uh huh” every time Dr. Ramani ends a sentence. I would tear that whole room apart if I were there. We get it, but you can ease up with the active listening.
Outstanding content and material! Thank you for putting light on this subject!  If I may ask, I am not an english native speaker but I speak english fluently, but it’s a shame there are no more besides english, a lot of people could use some of this experience.  Maybe editing this one or on the next time maybe.  Thank you so much once again.
Dr Romani is the best
Dr. Ramani is the best 🌟
Hearing people sharing their anxiety experiences makes me even more anxious. Seriously that’s so weird
Thanks so much for sharing this.Every word is so true.Whenever I suffer with anxiety I am unable to share it with someone because there's stigma around this topic.Whenever someone shares their story it feels like I am not alone.
the way kendall really listening and respect the physician
shes so strong. i love her
🙌🏾🙌🏾 Dr Ramani
I wish she would read more and get an elocution coach.  IDK how old she is but she should be able to speak in complete sentences considering the amount of resources she has.
Proud of u kenny
I feel the same way
The cinematography 👌🏾
What I like about this interview is that Kendall is expressing her problem with anxiety without being hopeless...  And also there is no sad song in background. Yay  This is the style I like of telling problems... it is not the end of the world and we all deal with such mental issues
I couldn’t pay attention her saying right all the time was so distracting
Kylie,khloe-that’s how u do lip filler
So proud of Dr. Ramani!
Boohoo
Kendall  after every word: “Right”
Honestly liked the video.
How is this a video about anxiety with the most anxiety inducing opening segment ever 😭
This is so helpful and clarified alot to me
Nobody cares princess. 80% of North America has some kind of generalized anxiety disorder.   They don't all have the resources to do something positive about it.   Being rich doesn't mean you can't have anxiety (buzzfeed) it means nobody is going to feel sympathy for you about it.   Most people are anxious about real things, like leaving their house due to violence, not knowing if they'll be able to keep a roof over their families head.   This video just screams "I'm priveleged feel bad for me, I'm just like you" send me 10 grand and ill personally throw you a pity party.
right right right right right Right right right right RIGHT right right
Wow .... respect for her.
Thank you for sharing your experiences Kendall. I started struggling with panic attacks and anxiety last year and I’ve felt so alone in this feeling. This has helped me tremendously to know I’m not alone and I can still achieve my goals with anxiety. Sending love your way 💕
We all have anxiety. The only difference is you have the resources, money, family & privilege to deal with it.
I hate all kadarshians without kourtney🚶
I love Dr. Rameny!! Wow so great!
Are there English help line that can contact internationally?
LUA EM ARIES CARMA KENDALLL.. me abraça
I'm so related with this and im thankful becuz I learnt alot
eat the rich and all that but she’s still a human and material doesn’t change that
I have anxiety 😥. It’s the WORST thing ever! I started anxiety in the age of 10-9
i love you kendall stay strong and im proud of u
so much respect to kendall after watching this 🙏🏼
i mean i have really bad anxiety and social anxiety and i get panic attacks quite often and i think that this was a good video i love vogue so much i love their videos and magazines and products and this was a great video to connect to
Thank you so much Vogue and Kendall for this. Much needed.
Thank you for sharing!!!
Since i was young i feel this kind of  anxiety where i am so anxious when i am around with other people.the feeling that i want to talk and share my thoughts to them but there's inside of me that I'm comfortable being alone.
Way to go, Kendall! You’re such a kind young woman and have the sweetest demeanor 😍 wish you nothing but the best! ❤️
wow, this is really helpful, more of this vogue
i def have it
Her adding the positive about anxiety made my heart melt, i never thought about it that way & out of all the negative thoughts i go through a sweet one is nice
*I love you Kendall♡*
Proud of u kenny
Woah Dr. RAMANI 😮
This changed my life thank you Kendall
God. Preparing so much that now you are sort of a control freak. So me.
proud of you doc!!!!
People are too quick to judge others. Those of you saying she craves attention and publicity are wrong. Yes, she may have made bad mistakes, but you're all acting like you've never made them before!! I understand it's hard to put yourself in her shoes and to think with all of her privilege, she would be the happiest person in the world. But when you've been hounded by cameras since the age of 10, it's hard to blindly state that she's gone through absolutely nothing. Open your eyes people. Understand that celebrities are humans and go through the same daily things that you do too. Whatever this poor girl and other celebrities do, they're always silenced and told to be quiet. She can never be right. If she didn't open up about this, you'd all attack her for being snobby and selfish... but as soon as she does she's seen as lying and attention-seeking. Give her a break.
Dr Ramani: eloquently explains psychological functions of the brain Kendall: I like that I like wanna know everything
Stunning as always kendall xx
Kendall very proud of you.
Hahahaha, this is the best joke of the year XD
Anxiety is perpetually waiting for the other shoe to drop...
I feel good to know how to fight anxiety
so dating harry is one of the cause of anxiety
Kendall you are a queen. I can totally understand what you have gone through. Because i feel like i relate with you alot. I am priveliged too but ofcourse not like you, but still when people see me they see a poised girl who has everything and they think i would be so happy. But only i know that i go through this every day. I get these panic attacks on daily basis. And you are the one who gave me so much courage. So thank you alot💞
Well at least she has enough of money to see a therapist... I don't know, it is impossible for me to get sad for the rich people like her. Girlll go see a therapist, go to a treatment. You have this opportunity. Some people are not rich enough to afford a therapist...
omg I'm laughing when they're talking about someone not being cautious during covid, LIKE SHE DIDN'T THROW THE BIGGEST NON SOCIALLY DISTANCED BIRTHDAY PARTY WHEN GATHERINGS WEREN'T ALLOWED hahhahahah girl please
🤡🤡🤡🤡
I mean I also have anxiety and that is not an excuse to being mean and intimidating all the time
stoners love to ignore the fact that weed is the main cause of anxiety.
our little kenny is raising awareness on anxiety.
This is awesome 👏🏽 thank you Dr. Ramani and Kendall Jenner! ✨🙌🏽
i feel even anxiety disorders are being glamorized here. Soon it would be a fashion to tell people that i have anxiety becausd kendall has it. Some people are going to overuse it now
Having anxiety is the worst of all time, I remember having it and started when I was on grade 3(elementary grade). I was too young to have it. Because of traumas and people keep invalidating you to that traumas. I started having depression wayback 2015 and having deep imaginations just to be happy and escape the reality. I'm 16 years old and I keep fighting for life!!!!! To people who's experiencing this, don't give up beautiful people!!!!!! You'll be okay! Just keep fighting. In case no said to you that they love you, I love you!!!!!!!!! Don't give up hun
Such an important discussion , so many people suffering alone in the world . Thank you Kendall 🙏
Lmfaoo maybe stop calling the paparazzi on urself and then u won’t have panic attacks
Thanks vogue now i magically can afford therapy and will jet off to a ski trip with my fam to help with my ‘AnXieTy’. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. It’s so weird how she constantly went around during the pandemic yet is socially anxious. Fvck Vogue. Constantly glorifying ppl like her who have put others ppl’s lives in danger. Going to parties and throwing them doesn’t seem like an anxious person... sure she must have her days, I’m not trying to invalidate that. It’s just interesting how effing HYPOCRITICAL she is.
Says the girl who threw parties and jet setted in covid. Yes her anxiety is VALID. She deserves to be at peace but that’s besides the point. She is part of the problem. She’s putting vulnerable ppl in danger. Ppl who can’t afford healthcare let alone private healthcare and the best of the best that she can. She has emotional support, she has financial support, more than 80% of Americans don’t have that- I mean forget abt America, many ppl around the world can’t be supported through their rough times. Hahah I hope y’all know that vogue made this so that ppl can feel empathy for her bc she was facing backlash recently. She’s Anna wintour’s leech and so is Anna. It’s mutual. They both get paid.
I love this. Absolutely love that a hige platform like vogue is bringing up something like this like it’s normal, because it is. I had an anxiety attack this morning and this video calmed me down.
❤️❤️
the stupidity of some people in the comment section baffles me
Wow that’s not easy!
Tjis is so helpful.. cheers Kendall 👏❤️
This came out exactly at the time i needed it ❤️ mad respect for kendall
I had generalized anxiety, social phobia and panic disorder for years of my life. No one ever explains how it actually was for me.
thank you so much for this, i dont feel alone
2510 angel number
how ever you are still i love you
Thank you dr Ramani & Kendall. This is confirmation for me.  I have similar problem. I also handle it with make schedule & preperation. But our knowledge is not perfect, so don't ever GIVE UP Kendall. Keep learning. For me you are blessed but still keep yourself as a simple young woman 🍹❤
Love Ramani, her works with narcissistic personality disorders made me understand some friends and an ex. 🙏🏼
Thanks Kendall for giving mental issues visibility ❤️❤️❤️❤️this is really important!!
I am 17 and i'm struggling with anxiety and panic attack . Really happy to see you'r doing this . i feel understood and nothing like this feeling can help me to get some peace . it helps to educate myself as well.thanks💜
omg she met Dr Ramani 🙏🙏🙏💖🤍💖 love her
Narcicisst!!
1:10 wth!? HARRY STYLES!?
diganle que pestañee xd
If I had to be friends with one of the Kardashians/Jenners it would be Kendall. She seems like the only somewhat down to earth person in that family.
Dr Ramani ❤
kendall with harry at 1:10
OMG IT'S DR. RAMANI!!!!
That doctor isn't letting kendell speak
Good job Vogue.
Funny how at 07:20 she talks about people who are not cautious with COVID and says that she can relate to the person who asked that question when in reality she organized a MASSIVE birthday party and attended multiple other parties during the pandemic. So hypocritical.
can someone please tell me if i have anxiety. i’m too scared to tell my mom to get me a diagnosis.   - i feel too aware when i hang out with people, for example this is how it feels, it’s like knowing that ur breathing or blinking 24/7.  - i shake when i get into arguments w ppl.  - i cancel plans bc i would rather stay in even if i love the person sm  - when i get in trouble or i’m abt to, i feel like i can’t breathe and i start freaking out.  - i hate hate hate facetiming sm  - i’m always nervous i’m awkward or too boring for someone, i also overthink a lot
please watch alyson stoner to fully understand what stars like kendall are going through: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXOATB1v3jM
Wow Kendal u are gorgeous 🥰🥰🥰 love my kardashian and Jenner sisters
Right right right....
everything kendall says is so relatable woa..
This hit it for me I’m hyper aware of my body and others I can’t help it!! I’m always observing actions and reactions
DR Ramani is one of the most insightful women Ive ever listened to. Shes a great teacher and therapist, I’d die happy to end up in her class haha
Omggg thanks for this incredible video Kendall 🤍 we love u girl
I really love how Kendall opens up <3
I resonate with this, I get anxiety going to gatherings or family parties because I think they will judge me because of the way I look.
I try to prepare for a meeting a day or two before. And as Dr. Ramani said. It really helps a lot!!!  And I really felt sooooo good to see that kendal opened up about it. Because there's always someone who need to hear it someday or other.
Even if you're a billonaire, you're going to have vulnerabilities , anxiety's one of hers, it should be respected that she speaks about it, not just to help herself, but to help others, she could easily sleep on her millions,and just think about makeup, but she is trying to contribute and give back, that's admirable.
Anyone else have a hard time breathing while hearing about anxiety?
Thnks!!!!...
The best doctor in the world
Please put up more episodes with this subject
Love this program
I love that even on Vogue my fav Dr. Ramani is still looking exactly like herself! and also WHAT DR. RAMANI IS ON VOGUE!!!
Harry styles left the chat
❤️❤️
Thank you Dr.Ramani ,  this truly means a lot
Dr. Ramaaaaniiii ok. Indian?
This is amazing!
Omg...I can relate to this
so glad kendall is sharing her story!
Shout out to Vogue for raising this issue, loved listening to Kendall and Dr Ramani talk on ways to manage anxiety.
take a shot every time Kendall says "right"
Kendall: “Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Totally. Yeah.”
Is this a PR stunt or is she genuine about this issue?
Wow.. I really feel like I can relate to Kendall here, Dr. Ramani seems phenomenal
I have had anxiety my whole life but social anxiety has taken over the last couple of years. It started with blushing for anything. Something as small as someone saying my name would cause me to blush excessively which people would point out and cause me to blush even more. The masks have helped a lot with this but now I’m struggling to speak. I have trouble talking and it’s affecting my voice. I don’t understand why this happens but I hate it, I hate it, I hate it.    I try to tell myself it’s all in my head because it is but when you’re in the middle of an anxiety attack, it’s hard to shift your focus.
Thank you for opening up! Very brave thing you did
Dear viewers; there’s nothing wrong with listening to someone talk first, and then responding back after they’ve shared what they’re talking about with you.
Dr. Ramini is terrific
Dr Ramani is perfect. The way she explain everything in a calm and easy way to understand, and bring such an amazing thoughs about this is perfect.
i had anxiety. I had to start consistently exercise and take low dose of clonazepam. i only take if i have to get on plane. Kendall learn meditation.
Thanks sooooooo much. This is a breath of fresh air.
Everyone has struggles of some sort. Therapy and a great tool. This is very good. Help many people
“right” “right” “right”
Kids feel everything, thats why she has anxiety, not because of her now life
Thank you so much for sharing Kendall! You are definitely not alone!
This is all pure strategy of Attention seeking, coming on vogue to talk about anxiety lol
Oh yes, “people who are anxious are always monitoring their bodies.” Nearly all my life that’s been me. I had no idea that is related to,or a part of having Anxiety. Just that sentence helped me.
After watching this I definitely had to unsubscribe. This is really stupid.
Wow this helps me a lot. I love them people.
I'm here for Dr. Ramani
how about the anxiety of potentially losing your job? how about the anxiety of not being able to pay rent or put food on the table?  sorry i can’t relate to her anxiety about too many people at photoshoots or fashion shows
That twich that Kendall’s did at 6:52 I use to always do to keep myself for not act nervous bc of my social anxiety
What an inspiring young women! You can have all the money in the world and still lack health. People will just never understand. Anxiety is the worst to experience ever. I’ve suffered for years since the age of 7. I feel you girl. Thank you for making this video ❤️
Thank you Ken for taking in viewer/fan questions! Thoughtfully humble and kind!! We need more of this spread around for sure!! 🙏💚
To all the boys having anxiety 🍻🍻
Spot on 🎯
So brave of you, beautiful Kendall ... 💝
My anxiety went away when I changed to a clean diet, and did a liver cleanse.
Oh yeah she’s got such a stressful life.  It must be such a struggle to be famous for being famous.
She’s a life path 11 & we’re just super sensitive to everrrrrything.
Oh no!!! Another millionaire trust-fund trash queen has anxiety! Stop the presses!!
signs of her anxiety were shown throughout kuwtk
waiiitt... but why did vogue included the vid of harry and kendall in a car, when vogue know they arent together anymore..? could this be a hint that they are back together?
dont care
Vogue, why would you use an anxiety inducing intro on A VIDEO ABOUT ANXIETY!? You realize the majority of the people watching are also probably anxious, so just why?
I'm so glad to see Dr. Ramani being given this platform. I've been following her YouTube channel for years and she's just brilliant. 💯
Queen Dr Ramani ❤️
Hold on, hold on, let me grab my tiny violin 🎻
See...you NEVER know what people are going through.
Interviewer : * says anything* Kendall : “right”
I only heard Right the whole entire video 🙃
♥️♥️♥️Kendall & Vogue ♥️♥️♥️
Thanks Kendel, you are my favorite!
Its like so hard being rich and pretty. It like makes me nervous just like regular poor ugly people. Even when I feel ok I like get jealous of people with problems so I pretend I have problems so people pay even more attention to me
Kendall, thank you SO MUCH for opening up about this. I'm 30 and I just started having panic attacks about a month ago. It's been a tough road since then, but I love what you said about it being a beautiful thing. It's made me take better care of myself, especially with eating right and getting enough sleep. I hope lots of people watch this and realize they're not alone.
Thank you ❤️
So relatable, she's so normal LUL
Cocaine also makes me HELLA anxious tbh.
I amm very awarreeee of my enxxxxiety  I watch this video for only 4 second Education matters for speaking also
Kendall being a scorpion for 11:37 minutes straight 🤣 anyways she is super mature love it
I just realized even more so that I have anxiety. Makes so much sense.
The Dr is very interesting but the girl is very annoying. "Right" "right" "right". I'm sad Kendal did her lips.
This therapist is talking too much. She’s trying to promote her business too much. She’s not treating Kendall like she actually has anxiety. She needs to listen to Kendall
good for Kendall, but this therapist is so helpful.
Poor thing something that we all go through but don't get praised
Kendall is so gorgeous, she doesn't deserve hate
this is the best thing vogue has done
this kinda explains why so many people who meet her think shes “rude.”
Not trying to be mean but how many times does she have to say “right”
Great conversation!
Wow Dr. Ramani is amazing!!
this was a very good session. thank you
What a queen. She’s honest, funny, sweet, and is just open. I feel so bad. I have anxiety too and she is honestly my favourite Jenner.
The realist of them all 100%
这是印度妞吗～还挺好看～
It’s so crazy she literally looks like each sister in different ways so much. She seems down to earth.
Ponganme subs en español LPMQTPPPPP
Dr. Ramani seriously CHANGED my life and life perspective for the better. I LOVE her videos.
THANK YOU for talking about this!! I'm agoraphobic and have been for  about 12 years now..it has been so hard. Thank you for bringing awareness to anxiety disorders and reassuring us that we're not alone. It means so much!!🧡❤
Atleast your a multi millionaire
My favorite psychologist!
She's so beautiful
omg no way!! I love Dr. Ramani, honest to god found her videos exactly when I needed them most, I don't even remember how I found her, but i'm glad I did.
All she struggles with is having too much money. Ridiculous
RIGHT
So you mean KENDALL'S so called ANXIETY is what she uses as an excuse to go around shading someone to make her being anxious to make "her" feel better!!?? Not buying it!
Dr. R is awesome and Kendall is awesome.  Perfect combo.
Thank you so much for that Kendall. 🤍
Dr Ramani is such a queen. Beautiful soul.
I see Dr. Ramani, I click! 🤩
sooo👍👍👍👍
This was nice
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I wish they would've cut off Kendall's mic when Dr Ramani was speaking. Her "mmh, okay, right, exactly" is really disturbing lmao
Does she have "anxiety" during her crazy, lavish, over-the-top, tequila-soaked parties, most of which include her current NBA beau? Did her "anxiety" plague her as she slept her way through various NBA players on various teams, or all the others she's been linked with since she was a young teen? Or when she, in her words  "throws her cooch around wherever she wants"? Yeah...she's FULL OF IT!
I don't consider myself a fan of the Kardashians/Jenners, but I need to say that this video is really important. Anxiety can be detrimental and make you feel alone & without self-esteem. I think it's crucial that someone that famous opens up about it. I feel more understood and it gives me strength to think that I can also aim high in life, anxiety or not. So, thank you @Vogue and thank you Kendall Jenner for this video.
Thanks for sharing kendall and Vogue💖
Celebrities are humans too.
Cool to see her open up and humanize herself.
🤙🏻🤙🏻
Such an important conversation. Thank you 😊
Wow vogue, you really care about people don’t you. So long as they have the plastic face and were born into ridiculous wealth. Pepsi commercial, anyone ?!?  So. Relatable. 😃🤣😒
Honestly… thank you vogue.  This is the content we need right now.   Never thought I’d actually feel like Kendall Jenner is relatable to me in any way… but this was by no means a futile lesson.   Thank you Kendall for sharing your story.
When is part 2 coming out
I hear you but are you just riding the trend of mental health now ? This is a real and serious topic for all of us who literally have close to no help who are poor .You have access to all the best help possible so I’m not so sure how I feel about this .I do hear you and if you think you suffer you literally have no clue how every day people feel.I think you seem like a special person and I do feel like you meen well but this is kind of insulting because you have billions of dollars you are loved you are beautiful your body is perfect so wtf ? Ok luv still I hope you feel better as no one should suffer so I wish you to feel better either way .
THIS! ❤️
I am so glad Vogue is speaking out in mental health
I enjoyed listening to this Doctors knowledge on anxiety. It didn't seem like Kendall was there to learn though. Anxiety has a huge spectrum. Why immediately judge the Doctors perception of Anxieties severity before you even know the correct terminology or concepts. This doctor has so much knowledge and help to give, if you let her.  So many of us would be overjoyed to be able to see an amazing psychologist like her.  #SpeakUpForLee
Whoa💛
Yeah ok she gots too much anxiety hahhh ask us that our life is not that easy can y? Not her
Kendal Jenner : I have anxiety Everyone Else : oh that's too bad. Only if you had millions of dollars to help yourself... oh wait
Just because she’s rich, doesn’t mean she’s not entitled to HUMAN emotions... like... if you think that I feel bad for you
Why does this video come out a day after I had a panic attack and anxiety wheezing?
I love you Kendall, and whoever may be reading this xoxoxoxo
I love kenny
Hey everyone, the greatest info that I have had was with the Seans Shy Program (i found it on google) - definately the most useful resource that I have ever seen.
Dr. Ramani is a godsend
anxiety  no problem ASHWAGANDHA
She is so perfect Kendal
She talks like dixie
Was almost saying “ uh she’s living a dream life! What anxiety is she talking about “  But when she said she feels like she can’t breathe and wants to go to the hospital I felt it in my soul... It’s easy to judge ppl UNTIL u go through the same situation!
Thank you
Very true it doesn't matter we all have something in our head making us feel that way maybe we're sensitive at least she's letting everyone to know to come out and get help being in public and this way she's helping others to get help. Thank you
Ugh I feel like crying. Thank you so much for this
I have social anxiety and agoraphobia because my afraid that anywhere I go there will be big crowds and violence
Well said its terrifying those fkn panic attacks
When did literally anyone ask Vogue
I just found out I have anxiety I also think I may be wrong
So pitty it is so short this deserve an hour :))
This fool has no idea what is real life. They live in a bubble of adoration by others
Self-doubt is an awful thing.
This is great, glad to know I'm not alone:)
Great to see a move onto an nb topic, meeting new people well done dr Ramini
Jesus is our lord and savior
Dr Ramani is Capricorn ♑ of course 😍😇
🦕
1-800-MoneyProblems
Famous problems lol
I would have definite anxiety with all her family members
Absolute garbage, lmao
everyone has anxiety at times. It shouldnt even be a thing. It's like saying you breath air
Who knew doctor Ramani before watching the video? She's just wonderful.
PLEASE MAKE THIS A SERIES. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT!
I understand Kendall very well. I have anxiety as well and sometimes I feel like I’m about to die and get scared and worry so much. Anxiety is the worst.
You go girl.....So Proud of  Love you Kendall ❤
i love dr. ramani sm🥺 she’s literally saved my life. so glad she’s getting the recognition she deserves🤍
This is probably the most important video on youtube
I really like her and i like her beauty too. Yes she's not a supermodel. But she is a successful person. And i always knew that behind these aggressive behaviours and cruel way of talking is something wrong. Alot of us are suffering in silence even though they may be fortunate, beautiful or successful. So please be kind and don't judge people unless you go through what they have been through.
Thank you for this. My daughter told me to watch it as this is what and how she feels
I understand very well Kendall . I’m not criticized you because you are famous. You are human and feel like us . Anxiety is so sad . I’m dealing with anxiety and depression for 14 years.
Thank you Kendall I am so thankful you did this 💗💗
I’m glad they chose to put the cameras this way cause the background tho. Beautiful landscape! 🤩
Someone tell kenny to stop saying "right" while the therapist talks...
dr ramani <3
this is so relatable to me I cannot even put it into words. Literally every single detail said and explained I can relate to and have gone through or go through. Thank you for this video. I got to send it to my family to educate them a bit on my panic disorder and how I feel.
Watching this for Dr Ramani and Med Circle. They do fantastic informative episodes and to see them branch out is a wonderful thing.
Literally had a major panic attack a day before this was put on. My whole body went numb for almost 2 hours
Once again everyone gets anxiety not just broke people. Get that thought out of your head that only poor people have anxiety or depression....
The most un celebrity like kardashian....
God knows how hard life is dealing with anxiety..  everyday is a struggle📈
It’s so nice seeing a public figure come out about anxiety and social anxiety. I feel like people don’t talk about social anxiety specifically enough, and when it is spoken about people often stigmatize it
It looks like she has evil eye. She needs roqia, because if you have to much evil eye it can draw jins/ goasts to you.   But it seems she already has that, because she was talking in other videos about sleep paralizes. It can be djin bogaboz or djin aseeq.   Bogaboz is not harming, djin aseeq, you will need a strong imam to do a roqia.   Do roqia only by a imam that knows 60 hisib the whole koran and prays in a mosk. Because there are many thats say they know what to do, but dont. So only a known imam that knows the whole qoran. I hope she gets better soon. Afwul to be so young nd dont feel healthy.
ALLAH is my biggest therapist, ALHUMDOLLILAH.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TRANSPARENCY.  I'm done with people pretending their life is perfect!  Being relatable is so important.  Being open about your true self, shows immense strength. Pretending to seem "strong, and empowered" while not being able to have genuine conversation about real feelings and emotions is so toxic!  Thank you for trying to normalize conversations that are suppose to be kept "private", in hopes of "self preservation".
I find it so sad how so many of us have anxiety and depression these days man :(
I’ve watched every Dr Ramandi video on narcissism available. I once dated one. Ramandi was a god-send
Boo boo you have anxiety... but you also have a perfect life and billions in the bank... I have anxiety but nobody cares and I don’t have billions.... this girl is the worst. Hate her!
Kardahian trash disgust me
Kendall Jenner has narcissism NOT anxiety
You forgot Kendall’s severe narcissism
kratom cures anxiety
(Matthew 7:13-14) "Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it."   If you can't descern the times that we're in, you don't have the Ruach Hakodesh (Holy Spirit). The only way to do that is through the Yahushua (Jesus), son of Elohim. You need to accept that he's Christ and allow the spirit to lead you, not your flesh.   Don't be led astray by celebrities and others that are clearly lost in the things of this world, they will only lead you down the path of damnation, as they have sold their soul for worldly riches and glory.   Get right with God. I pray those with an open mind and heart can receive this message and it un-hardens the hearts of those dancing with the devil.
Omg she looks like Chloe.
You're not alone❤
i mean she's a scorpio
she's so gorgeous, reminds me so much of a young kris
POV: rich privileged white girl wants sympathy for the life she chose
Dr. Ramani you were so accurate with talking about anxiety it make my hands sweat.
Isn't it funny how she doesn't want people to say oh I have anxiety about this when they don't know what she's feeling but it doesn't matter what she's feeling because everybody is feelings need to be validated right so the person who has anxiety about a test or a job interview is still having anxiety and is still allowed to be upset about it....... I guess only her because she is who she is is allowed to feel real anxiety even when the doctor tried to explain it to her she was like yeah yeah yeah let me talk about myself...... 🙄
DR.RAMANI is the best!
i never realised that i had soo many signs of anxiety... im feeling the most relatable i've ever felt!  and yes that point of mentally scheduling is one of the best tips, to know who are you meeting, how many people, to be mentally prepared is always essential... cuz people like us are always aware but we needa also get along with it, just be prepared and it'll all go well ~~~  we are all in this together y'all~~
Dr.Ramani you are truly god sent queen.
i litterally dont even care
Thank you , this is all me and you telling that it's okay and you can get over it is a big thing
The overlined lip is a bit off at this point
Aghhhh rough life this kid had.
Anxiety doesn't care if you're wealthy or not. What you have on the outside has nothing to do with the chemicals in your mind. The toughest person to have anxiety is a celebrity because their life is under a magnifying glass no matter what. That would be terrifying for me.
I actually really appreciated this as someone who deals with anxiety. Thank you for doing more than just spread awareness, and go into detail, and answer questions, and meet face to face with someone. Hearing this video almost made me feel heard.
this reminds me of when she came out with acne
😳
PEOPLE NEED TO MEDITATE
Me gustaría que tuviera subtítulos en español😕
I’m glad she’s talking about this bc most people don’t get it
I'm so glad that she's doing better now that she's stopped drinking Pepsi
Nobody: Kendall: “right, okaaaay, riiggggght, mhhm kay”
HSP hyper sensitive personality look it up . We sensitives feel everything.
Who chose these fonts though 🙃
Omg stfu
♡
Yea right, right, oh, okey, right
I'm struggling anxiety alone. When it hits I try to calm myself, sometimes it works but mostly I feel like I'm going to die, I feel numb, losing breath 😔 its so hard.
Kendall is so strong!!!
Take a shot every time Kendall says “right” “yeah” “mhm”
She have kim kardashian eyes ❤️❤️❤️
Люди постоянно ее осуждали мол ты че такая грубая и тд, но вы сами представьте с детства находиться под камерами папарацци которые буквально сталкерят вас каждый день, конечно все накладывается и тут нельзя быть не грубым, тем более если у вас панические атаки и соцапатия
Nice to see the human side of the Kardashians
This was a great idea Vogue! Appreciate Kendall opening up and love that mental health professionals are giving insight 💕
"BEFORE YOU DIAGNOSE YOURSELF WITH ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT IN FACT JUST SURROUNDED BY ASSHOLES" Kendall has been around Kim and Kris and other negative people for so long, poor angel needs a break.
Wish this was longer!! Great series Kendall!
Dr. Ramani is a narcissism expert, I know she ain't gonna interview some other Kardashians & Jenners. I wonder where Kendall falls on that spectrum or if she's an empath. Out of all of them, she does seem kinda human. Truly, no offense. I don't know much about Kendall - alls I know is DR is a total G.
YAAASSS DR RAMANI!!!
Thank you for sharing.
Loved this chat. Also, anxiety is like a rollercoaster, one you think it’s over, it goes downhill again. I can go days without anxiety then it sneaks in again. Love you all who have anxiety. You’re so strong.
Tell me, Kendall, how ru going thru what ur going thru...
Women jus love to self diagnosed themselves just for an excuse of their behavior/actions
AINT NOBODY GIVE AF HAHAHAHHA
She looks like Kim Kardashian
Gabatrol is a miracle for me- I've dealt with anxiety where my heart feels like it's going to explode- this is a natural vitamin that I take when I feel like that, and somehow it calms me. That, and weighted blankets- for those of you out there who suffer - sending you love ❤️
Yea. Rights right. Uhmm. Yes right lmao, fckn stupid
This is helping me so much, anxiety sucks
*Anyone **_HATES_** loud noises?* They make my palms sweat & heart palpitate like crazy. I can't think or concentrate and it's as though every sound gets amplified and this rising feeling of panic erupts Like people with heavy stomping footsteps as they run/walk, screeches and screams, slamming of doors, kids kicking a ball hard within an enclosed space and hearing it smack against surfaces & reverberate through the house, boisterous and loud voices, people arguing and ignoring their surroundings... I feel as though these are normal typical everyday sounds, but I can't seem to control my involuntary reactions to them. I get panic attacks and reminding the people to tone it down seems unreasonable. I hate it and hate myself for being this way. I want to get away to an island because there seems to be no way out of this.
I heard Kendall got anxiety disorder before and I got the same problem. So, I never clicked this fast. And thank you Dr.Ramani about teaching how to reach people by body language.  I always cross my arms or stand aloof to people. I will try to uncross my body and smile more.  Thank you. 🙏🏼
oh my goodness, b e a u t i f u l. one of the most comfortable videos i’d ever seen. it’s exactly how kendall says at the last part, is the feeling of feeling understood, and how someone could finally put into words what i feel. every little thing you’d said is wonderful, and put me in a more calm place. thanks. it’s amazing that someone who has this level of reaching to people does this thing, you are helping tons of people💘
I just love this young woman. She is so inspiring .
Rich people deserve anxiety and depression, stop hoarding human resources for yourselves.
I too worry a lot about if my photoshops are perfect enough, or if Ibiza will have nice weather, or the crushing anxiety over if not enough people worship me
People are interested in hearing about mega wealthy people talking about anxiety?
I wish I had Dr Ramani by my side of recovery. Would have been much easier. On this side of the world (south east Asia) people don't even know the term narcissist.
Kendall is hoax
This was a good conversation.. if that makes sense
first thought i said this house is so stylish then i noticed taschen's bauhaus book at 7:20 very lovely
How many times has Kendall said “right” 😆
You can feel their energies match, loved the conversation! 👌🏼
i'd like to clarify (regarding the disclaimer of the video) that anxiety cannot be treated by only meditation. Meditatio can be a complement added to the psychotherapy.
Dr. Ramani is my favorite psych channel on YouTube. She is amazing!
You should hang out with that duchess chick. Both got everything they could ever want and for both it isn’t enough. Yeah y’all would get along.
Who cares
I struggle with this and its literally put everything into words
This was extremely helpful! Thank you very much!
I can relate everything she said believe me I know that feeling. Thanks Kendall
Remember when Kylie was pissed at Kendall not being sociable enough? That was probably her anxiety starting to kick in.
I can relate to her so much!
Omg Kendall's voice is similar to Kim's.. ew
F* Off I don't care about celebrities anxieties. Try feeding a family all by yourself and you'll see there is no time for anxiety. Having anxiety is a privilege
Respect for Kendall Jenner being vulnerable like this. It can't have been easy for her given she's in the spotlight so much. Important reminder that we're all human and go through the same stuff ❤
I admire her for speaking up!!
i clicked bcs of dr.Ramani
I'm the same way🤔
There's more disorders than there are sufferers now.....ha ha ha hee😁
She is so brave.
It makes so much sense, for I have three daughters but when my eldest when in her maturing state surprised me with so much emphasis on how she sees The world. Pressing upon her defenseless Anxious state of mind. At first I did not take it seriously and Joked about it, thinking that I would release some of her tension. But then realized with the consistency of her mood, tearing up on her routines on a daily basis being a stewardess. I realized she needed my help as a Dad. She helped strengthen my biblically-based virtues of every anxious and oppressed scenario in the Bible. Which led her to read on these issues which is now the crux of our relationship. TY for being transparent.
Im sorry, but i genuinly dont have any interest in hearing a wealthy global superstar moan about her anxiety. She can afford all the help she needs. Theres actual people suffering out there. Shes not one of em.
Watching Kendall because of Harry..
this is a really great thing you did, you really explained what is important in anxiety, thank you
Kendall jenner
Remind yourself with anxiety you are “uncomfortable but not in danger”
Don’t know why I can relate to every single bit of it!!!! 💔:(
Lol… another rich kid with rich kids problems..
Open arms, 💃 make eye contact, 👀 and smile. 😊 😁 ✌️🕶️
Check your bank account
Love these videos! Stay safe everyone 😍
I bet you’re so sad with you’re slightly under $1B net worth 🥲 poor baby you’ll be ight
"anxiety is like a magnifying glass and it magnifies only the bad things" wow what a quote
Who else even struggle to chat/message now. I’ve become too accustomed, too comfortable with being isolated, I’m literally afraid of interaction now and struggle keeping up with conversations.
You know people might think like she has fame, a privileged life, an extensive family that cares and so many people who like or follow her and everything, but trust me, fame in any sort will make you feel validated and good enough only for a short period of time. It does not solve the mental and physical health problems you are facing , it does not make you feel happy, sometimes even lonelier than before. So one should not judge anyone by their privileges, or Instagram following and posts , or money or the fame they are getting and think that their problems are so minute and not worth attention or worse, to think that they don't have any issues in their lives. They are humans before they are celebs. And they go through what we don't talk about on a daily basis and at a much larger level, but just because they don't voice it, we feel that they don't face any issues in life.
Oh no!!!! Kendal has anxiety????? Try working the night shift at a cheese factory doing manual labor. She has never worked a day in her life.
The “scrolling through the comments while watching” squad
Wooow this helped... I was in need of this
Just an excuse to keep being rude with waitresses  and with anyone "inferior" to her.
No ones coming to save you.   We aren’t taken care of like celebrities.
You make other little girls insecure about them selves just like your sisters with your unrealistic standards of beauty and by not saying: “You are not ugly you just didn’t have 5 surgerys before you are 18”
gr8 story :)
This is propaganda for the rich. Not saying she can’t have anxiety but her anxiety would definitely improve if she didn’t hoard wealth and didn’t focus her worry inward.
She's a human! Who knew
People need to get off social media and get into nature. Stop documenting your lives. Return to the present. Go do ayahuasca.
The secret of your future is hidden in your day routine . Successful people do daily what the unsuccessful people do occasionally.
No one know that Kendall have a beautiful  heart she nice beautiful and vulnerable  i love her she speak her truth  i am big fan of her i don't care if is privilege she is a beautiful human  people should get to know her before judging her
Been overworked hahahah, never worked a day in her life haha
Really don’t care shut up
this is the content I signed up for when I subscribed to this channel. 🤍
Lol , lots of stupids on earth. Proof :  Kim family exist .
I think this video must be longer like you prepear the set and kendall and doctor BUT you did just 11 minute long video broo just dont please i want other videos be longer. Also thanks for this series it is exactly what society need.
We love you Queen 💜
Thanks kendall and vogue 🙌❤
Not having proper balance nutritions for times will lead to many health issues. One of it it's anxiety. And for the long run, it will lead to depression. HALLO.....wake up
Im sorry but Kendall saying "I feel this" about having anxiety surrounding people not being COVID safe when she literally threw a birthday party and told people not to post it on social media..... gurl.......
Thank You Kendall  for opening up and helping other's!
Must be so hard having everything given to you and never having to have any real worries in your life
who cares?????? after a year of people dying in the pandemic of lack of money or insurance ....shortage of food and political crash.... who cares?? about this stuff?
This is great information
Lmao
take ur therapist a pepsi i’m sure it’ll clear up
I know Kendall is STRONG. You go gurrrlllll❤️💪
Every “Opens Up on”-Story gets automatically views and sympathy for the star.  “opening up” is literally a PR-Stunt by now.
Oh their just like us. Ohhhhh blah blah blah you are a spoiled brat and completely out of touch with reality.
anxiety is an emotion, not exactly a medical diagnosis.
I think ramani aunty is an Indian
Well here comes another brand idea...ANXIETY by KENDALL
No one cares what celebrities, ball players and actors think or say anymore.
Yep.........yeah . .............👀👂👂
🙏
I love her 💕📈 anxiety is real I have it bad
Always remember, medicines do not always cure. The more you take, the more you???
I love you, Kendall 💓
Who cares
Hey
I love Dr. Ramani! Kendall did a great job too! Thanks again ladies! It’s much appreciated!🙏
*https://youtu.be/7D1jDmnF9Ro* ⬆️⚠️⚠️⚠️⬆️⬆️⬆️⚠️⚠️⚠️⬆️
I suffered with social anxiety all my life
Most docs have no idea nor knowledge about it or acknowledge it coz most of them are blinded in med. So most of them would rather put you in prescriptions and once you are in med prescriptions, 😇😇😇
Must b hard being rich since birth. Having things handed to you. Affording million dollar therapy. Havin anything or anyone youd ever dreamed of....
watching this video made me feel relief, I mean knowing that it is not just me experiencing social anxiety, shortness of breathe, etc. it makes me feel safe for sum reason
If you don't have enough nutrients, you definitely will experience anxiety. For long run, once will have depression. That simple
Love u Dr ramani
I wish Kendall could sit there and truly listen. Treatment is a gentle process and Dr Ramani is the best.
This video is informative, warm and quite relaxing
Anxiety is fake
Grateful for Kendall and Vogue- thank you for this 🙏🏽
Anxiety feels like curse I hope Kendall and fellow people who also struggle with anxiety to stay strong.
WOW WOW WOW. thank you both and vogue so much for this amazing and honest conversation. these are things I feel very often and I'm happy that they were expressed in such a simple way.
This is beautiful 💖
I feel like this video came out cause everyone was saying how rude she is. I’m sure the anxiety has a lot to do with it but it’s not an excuse to be rude to others.
Buy $amc
Thank you i am also struggling w social anxiety, im always sad.
This is so comforting knowing I’m not alone 🥺🤍Love you Kenny, honest.
Anxiety is a demonic spirit the oppresses people. Tell the spirit of anxiety to leave you in the name of Jesus!
Thoughts and prayers to you Kendall. I know life must be so trying for you #givemeafuckingbreak
kendall
lol she’s such a hypocrite
Good god this is stupid. Give mr the dislikes back
I love listening to privileged multi millionaires complain about how hard their life is
OMG DR RAMANI
Living for Dr. Ramani love her!
Kendall saying she's a hypochondriac is very interesting given the fact that during covid she held a large party for her birthday where nobody wore masks....
If anyone dares say celebs can’t have mental illness cause they’re privileged, think of Robin Williams :(
can't get enough of dr ramani!!
I'm glad she has that. Knowing this made my day even better.
This is so helpful.
Me too,i’m only 10 and i get anxiety over everything,i started having shortness of breath about 6 months ago.
First world problems
Ahhhhhhhhh Christ. Everybody's got anxiety. Who cares.
Kendall, your symptoms sound exactly like mine. I have panic disorder. Once i was diagnosed with that i was able to be treated in a way that really helped.
She’s not listening she cutting Dr. Ramani as if she knows it all. I wished she would’ve interviewed someone else.
it's so good of Kendall n all celebs to use their platform to share such things.. mental issues feel normal and curable when people talk about it and de- stigmatize it..
Anxiety is real. but she chose to be in the limelight. So of course she makes money on being an attention w****, you can walk away anytime....
Kendall interrupting every two seconds:  right, yeah, right, yeah  😩😩
Right
Thankyou for sharing your story i feel what you feel 😪
btws anxiety isnt a excsue to be rudwe to staff or employees at restaurants. I unde stands she has anxety but gurl you can't use that as an excuse, she should try and get better at handling her anxiety
So no one’s gonna talk about how they put a video of her and harry styles 💀
I am grateful for this video. This week I had panic attacks and constant anxiety and hearing someone talk about it was very important. When the sensations go away we celebrate simple things like being able to eat or sleep. I am very proud of Kendall 💖✨
Neic 🌷👍😍🙏🍁🍁
Just realized I’m a hypochondriac by watching this video which is such a hypochondriac thing to do 😂
This was a great video, it has taught me so much! :)      P.S i really liked the scene where she and Harry were together... not in a bad way
She could have easily choose to be out of the spot light like many other celebrities.
Anxiety of being a billionaire lmao i dont care.
kendall jenner  you looking  so beautiful 😍😍🤩🤩
I consider her the normal one out of all the Kardashians
i love how celebs nowadays bout anxiety ,depressions ,drug abuse etc like jb , kendal , selena , billie and many more . these are real influencers
This really helps me. Thank you😇
she still human
I really needed this.
Talk about how your family has destroyed any modern values.
I liked what the psychologist said. You have to take it easy when going up, or you will not feel well. I also see myself in Kendal, I always have a belly ache 🤒
Thank you💜
I knew something was wrong with me , I just didn’t know what . Thank you 🙏
Love Dr.Ramani & Kendall ❤
i appreciate this video
I love you Dr Ramani! 💙🦋
Thank you Kendall for opening up. I feel you so much and I am happy you could desribe all the feelings I am feeling too.
right right right right right right right right right right right
Ok but lets talk about the view through the window 😍
When I had an Anxiety attack at skl ,the counselor told me that some ppls brains know how to react to different situations they know when to fight but people with anxiety their brains tell them to just stand there and panic and it really hit me.
It litteraly made me cry,   knowing that we are all in this...
I hate when people think that celebrities shouldn’t be feeling these normal human emotions and struggles just because they have money. If anything I think the money and attention just worsens it.
Uhg lies
The hardest thing of all is feeling alone ....so true ...Brava!
what kind of filter are they using in this video cuz in some shots you can see skin texture and blemishes in other shots those same areas are completely smooth? i wonder when will magazines stop using so many filters on their covers and even using filters during interviews cuz they are screwing with women's brains by creating unrealistic expectations
https://youtu.be/4spTZU7VHWg
I have panic attacks for 8 years and actually it’s ruined my life and every day I’m get through this. I feel better when I found out that it’s okay and I’m not alone
She looks so much like kim here!
Didn’t think I would like this, but I’m glad I watched.
Don't worry.. You are not alone.
🖤🖤🖤
Omg I like that she is opening up about this. How can she be a Jenner that I like who’s related to another Jenner who’s so hateful and dumb ( caitlyn)
But did a whole party just for her birthday 💀
Omg Dr Ramani. Queen!
Kendall is so honest!
Kendall looks like Khloé in this video
1:11 is that Harry
NOBODY CARES ABOUT A SPOILED, PRIVILEGED WOMAN'S STRUGGLES.
So me 🥺💔 I'm tired of it
Poor Kendall, how I understand her. No matter, who are you, how old, how famous and rich you are, it can be with any person and it is really very hard. And, it's hard, that lots of people may not understand you. And, when you are more sensitive than most people, it's also often very hard. I wish you and all people, who understand me, health, mental and phisical❤️
I’ve had it since I was 7. I’m 60. It’s exhausting.
haha this lady explaining to her what anxiety is and shes just like yeah i know
Love that Kendall is brave enough to open up  about her story!
9:38 I don’t think that this is the best thing to do if you have anxiety, because when I ‘rehearse’ it before and thinking about how things are going to go. My mind always goes to the bad things, and i think that a lot of people with anxiety will only think about the bad things that could possibly happen.
Dr. Ramani!
When you have everything. Theirs nothing more to look ahead for. Only misery. Good luck.
PERIODT
Anxiety is also treated with prayer. Worked for me when my ppl prayed over me.
Aww.... A billionair with anxiety... Everyone feel bad for her.
Love the analogy of "the social bends", i definitely relate to that.
They look like mother and daughter tbh. Also celeb news: Megan Fox listens to Britney Spears to fight fear of flying. Wow lol. I bet it’s Toxic
Ohhhhh brother smh
Listening to the tips and thinking to apply in a real scenario I am getting anxiety...
The entire conversation: Doc: You- Kendall: yeah! Doc: but- Kendall: Uh huh! Doc: have you- Kendall: Right!
So... Now I understand why I wanted to keep my life so....private. Anxiety 😵
Her anxiety is actually kind of like mine was
Poor thang I feel the same 😞 she’s my fav kardashian
It’s so crazy how your own mind can become your own worst enemy and go against you unprovoked. I feel like with anxiety there are a lot of triggers that come to play and that can set it all off which is why it’s almost hard to overcome it cos you will try to avoid your thoughts but somebody could say/do something that can trigger your anxiety to an extent that makes you uncomfortable and it’s like never ending.
This was really helpful, thank you 😊
the amount of times she said 'right' while the DR speaking triggers me
oVeRwOrKeD...oh em jeee Kendall Jenner has suffered sooo much in life I cant even😭 dear Lord please have mercy on her poor little rich soul, that maybe all that fame, wealth, and media haul doesnt become the death of her momma-bought celebrity status...too much for one person to bear...
I'm not even surprised that snakes also get anxiety
Dr Ramani is amazing❤️
my social skills depleted cause of lockdown... making eye contact is tougher cause my eyes are used to bouncing around on a zoom screen, sometimes I sweat intensely before after or when I'm talking (never used to happen), and my attention span is shorter. anyone else?   I love what the Doc said about easing your way into things. gonna carry that with me.
https://youtu.be/GKC6CidzOOw
Poor girl. I feel for her. I’m glad she can come out about this. I hope everyone knows that celebrities can feel this too.
Is this a series?
When’s the next episode. I feel safe.
Kendall's voice is similar to kourtney+kim.
I AM PROUD OF MY GIRL 💖 AND THANKYOU SO MUCH VOGUE IT WAS SUCH A NEED <3
She's so boring lol
I like Kendall but she is not inspiring at all.
Wow I’m only 2 minutes in and already in tears I’m already relating to her on so many non celebrity levels 😣 This video was a masterpiece Thank you Kendal and Dr Ramani 😌
It was like hearing myself! I struggle with the same issues. I am a lot older but Kendall make a life that works for you. Maybe a smaller circle. You don't need to go to every dinner party. Don't force that onto yourself. ❤
When Kendall said it makes you feel understood and it is such a nice feeling ! 🥺🤞🏻❤️❤️❤️
Anxiety is one of the worst , I almost ruined my relationship because of anxiety! It was like a huge storm of negatives scenarios in my mind and the fact that we were in a long distance relationship made it even worse. I worried about every single move ; thankfully I spoke about it and found a way to deal with it ! Stay strong and talk about it to your close ones just so they know and understand you better
Anxiety is a horrible experience. I have it since one year and I’m super unhappy. I’m feeling the whole time unwell and the most important part is that I’m feeling myself very alone. I can’t talk to people about my worries, even not my mum or a hotline. I just can’t get it and I’m falling deeper and deeper. It’s a horrible experience...
This conversation is so important. Bravo to Kendall, and Vogue <3
Ye what happened to her anxiety when she threw a huge party of 100s of people in middle of a pandemic
I feel bad for 1k people who disliked this video
Dr. Ramani!!!!
So annoying Kendall with that "yeah" and "right". God!
She’s rich she’ll get over it
Anxiety over what? Being rich and famous😂?! Woe is her!! Poor Kendal
She is so brave to open up, lots of respect
100 million in the bank
But why did they put the clip with Harry ?:/
She nothing special everyone goes through it
She's looking more and more like mini-Kris as she gets older.
Thank u kendal💜
Take a shot Everytime she says right
Thank you Kendall for this!!!!! TRULY
She’s so much different than her sisters..
Vogue, I hate you. You’ve actually made DOCTORS and SCIENTISTS speak to the world’s dumbest model. The woman can’t put a sentence together without saying “like” or “dope”
If you’re going to make videos about anxiety, why not platform the doctors’ name in the title of this series? Why is this spoiled brat’s name here.... she is not a doctor and she does nothing compared to them
Vogue, why would you belittle these doctors like that by putting them in a room with one of the most genuinely stupid socially-unaware women?
Holy crap 😳 answers I've been dying for have now been answered
I honestly hate how people think that being rich automatically means that you have no problems in your life
I’m sorry but the same person who hosted a huge party in the pandemic is now suddenly worried about seeing loads of people? The same person who doesn’t like it when people casually use the phrase “anxiety” is the same person who casually uses “ocd” in a vogue beauty secrets video? I’m not trying to invalidate or nullify her anxiety as I’m sure she does suffer but she must do better herself...
Harry makes it into every video
Everyone experience anxiety and that's a fact
Literally everything they talked about is true about me. Ever since COVID started my anxiety has been really bad. I always feel like I’m short on breath or feel super nervous whenever I feel something weird physically. When Kendall said that she feels like she can’t breath, I’ve never related so much. I 100% understand what Kendall goes through and I can tell you that it sucks. Sometimes I wish It would just go away but life isn’t always that easy. Respect to Kendall. 🙌🏼
kendall sucks
Thank you, thank you, thank you for this! It really helped me! It was EXACTLY what i need to hear to help me in a situation, so THANK YOU! We are no alone
i could literally relate everything smh.
She has always been my most favorite Jenner because of how down to earth she is
I relate so much. People have always thought I’m being rude when I try avoid certain situations or avoid certain people it’s just my social anxiety thats going to sky rocket once the opportunity presents itself I get supper cold but sweaty at the same time, flushed face and just want to break down into tears. It’s ultimately about the fear of being judged and not wanting to be awkward. All the stories about Kendall being rude to fans makes sense now. We often forget these celebrities aren’t perfect and feel the same things we do.
Song: Farewell My Dear - Brendon Moeller ❤️
Who gives a darn!
What a session 💙💙💙💙💙 Love love love itttt💕💕💕💕 Thankeww for all those advice about anxiety they're all really authentic and useful And thankewwww to the queen for making an initiative to talk about this issue with the most experienced and brilliant doctors across the globe Love you kennyyyy🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸
I’m here for Dr. Ramani all the way. Not any Jenner or Kardashian.
Did she not have a party during a pandemic 🥴
This talk is so important. Thank you for being open kendall ❤ and thanks you Vogue for making this. It might help a lot of people.
She’s the highest paid model in the world I mean she is expected of many things by many people! Anxiety is bound to happen! It’s understandable.
I’m so glad that this topic of mental health is finally getting the recognition it deserves. Say what you want, but for me I only discovered the consequences despite knowing the early signs. Kendall, we share the same age but a completely different life. But the suffering is the same. It hurts. No pity party. Just respect and love. ❤️
i got so excited when i saw that clip of harry lol
Unpopular opinion: She is the most beautiful Kardashian/Jenner
Oh please.  Miss me.
Im glad they made this video I feel like I can kinda relate to Kendall about anxiety
Dr. Ramani is amazing. Thanks for sharing this- big help.
i didn’t know that i had anxiety before watching this
So helpful talk with this woman, she’s so about not deepening into a judgment like kendal’s trying to say that she hates those people that don’t admit the ‘anxiety’ word, and she’s rather drawing this brain game theory and respecting everyone by not hurting their feelings. Anyway, thanks, Vogue
Dr. Ramani is the best!!!
This is such a wonderful idea. I have so much respect for Kendal for doing this, and Vogue for helping to put it together. ✊🙌
out of the topic but i saw harry and her for like a second and thought it was worth mentioning
I love this
I love how Dr. Ramani explains in depth about these issues. I didn't know I had social anxiety until I listened to her talk about it. I just thought it was an introvert thing😅
So happy to see Dr Ramani, I love her channel on YouTube. Kendall you should keep seeing her!
Dr. Ramani is probably one the best doctors in her field. She is just amazing! Her videos are inspiring and gives a lot of insight to why some people act the way they are.
Lies
Direct navodaya gayo kachu nahi bhaio
Literally last night I was thinking that wish I could have kendall or gigi's  type of body, fame ,money, height ,They don't have an struggle in their life , they're living my dream life etc. etc. And today it's on my recommendation . Sometimes god tells you that the life isn't that easy as you think .Be happy with what you have. :")
Thank you for this video I really needed this ! I deal with anxiety every day. I cant find a outlet or cope it .
Is anxiety like being overthinker? Or i got i wrong
I literally squealed once I saw Dr Ramani
You are amazing for sharing publicly about this!
my anxiety is so bad that i feel like vomiting  when a teacher asks me a question whose answer i already know.
Meaningful discussions!!!
This is amazingly created. Thank you! ❤️✨🥺
Bull💩 at its finest.
thank you so much for this
Omg i was feeling very low today and I got this in my recommendation ❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the type of video we need
And this is why I love Kendall❤
Devin Booker fan here🙋
Too much Kendall not enough Dr. Ramani I wish her interview was longer
Trans women aren’t women.  Her dad is still a man.
What a Load of CRAP! Boo Hoo Hoo
Aww Kenny it’s okay :)
Soon she will transform into a man and date caitlyn
When is the next episode coming out?
Lady,  stop being a hypocrite and do something about it. You can afford the best treatment.   You prefer to cause attention and  get publicity by whining like a b#tch about your problem  instead of  doing  something to fix it.   Oh wel....Millenial problems. .. they want attention for nothing.
Kendall Jenner being soo brave enough to talked about her anxiety is too much not to love her. 🥰
Is that harry styles at the car???
Thank you Kendall I really appreciate you sharing your story. I started having my first panic attack at 18 I am now 24 and I feel less lonely now :)
$1 billion anxiety 🤦‍♂️ LOL
oh no....         anyways
Mine started young too, I have the same symptoms. I’ve had childhood traumas and been through a lot and adult traumas too etc. it’s so hard the physical sensations and most of the time as a child people said to me I’m crazy or it’s in my head. Such a hard thing, needs to be talked about more. I love this!
Proud of you Kendall
The fact that kendall says "Right" to everything Dr. Ramani says
I am really proud of kendall that she talking about anxiety and her previous experiences about it but I donno in this interview she seems like a hypocrite. She never followed any Covid rules, attended so many parties, and had a big birthday party as well. I shouldn't say this but she always look like this most extroverted person in a friends circle, she can have nervousness about a situation, but anxiety is a whole another thing.
Shoutout to Harry for making it✌️
Everyone has anxiety now -_-
God I feel relieved Kendall came out about this cause I’ve always been ashamed of my social anxiety and hypochondria & fear of speaking & failure to put my thoughts into worried and feeling physically sick due to social situations. Social and healthy anxiety are so real. Thank you Kendall for speaking up
Who cares
Anxiety talk sponsored by DRINK 818. Alcohol gives you more anxiety LOL. Anyone who has anxiety and takes meds knows this. CHEERS !!!!
this genuinely made me smile. i'm so glad she's able to speak up about her anxiety in a healthy way. such a positive video!
Omg I love this. Thank you ladies ❤
Good job Kenny
This was actually helpful, wow.
Love you Kendall !
I love Dr. Ramani. I listen to her videos daily! They have helped me SO much!
Oh boooooo
She’s the most beautiful sister her and kourtney out of the sister bunch 💗
I don’t care
Dr ramani ❤👑
Just drink a pepsi duhh
She really came out of her comfort zone , started to interact with people more than before & became bold enough not to hide her imperfections..She changed for good which makes me love her more 🤍🤍🤍
Dr.Ramani is so amazing. She helped me so much with understanding I dealt with narcissistic ex and how to cope with it.
I srsly love Kendall🙌🤍
Parts of her body go numb? Maybe she should get tested for Multiple Sclerosis
This was so beautiful and amazing to watch. I can’t wait for the next episode 🥳🥰
Id like it only if she cries
People also have to realize that she has stalkers who are literally trying to kill her. Living with that fear has got to be extremely anxiety inducing.
This is a joke, she has no clue what’s she’s talking about.
She is such an amazing human.
Dad doesn't give you anxiety?
Thank you for sharing Kendall ❤️
harry ahhdhahfihfjskl
Hypochondriac as well!! WOW!!!! 😔😔
This is literally me and I’m glad to see how well I cope with my anxiety. It also explains my heighten sense of intuition. Which sometimes gets the best of me 🙃
People often perceive a reserved / quiet person as unfriendly / rude but they don’t take into account that people not even celebs just people in general can go through so much and it’s so easy as to misjudge them celebs doesn’t = perfect human
oh! i think i have social anxiety
Right right
Her and her bro are the only down to earth ons
Anxiety has nothing to do with her privilege. She goes through human pain no matter what’s in her purse. I swear anxiety is worse than physical pain. I’m sad she feels this, and you know fame is probably most of the cause.
TO LOSE YOUR BREATH IS HORRIBLE I FEEL FOR YOU I NO I HAVE ASMA I CANT EAT CHOCOLATE. I WIILL LOSE MY BREATH. . I PRAY TO GOD HE HELPS ME .I WILL PRAY FOR YOU.
Please give me doge any amount is ok thank you  DRDLKRTb21rquqzi3d5TpeeU1sA8aFCmKg
I feel so bad for her because I know that horrible feeling of needing to be rushed to the hospital for anxiety, but for me that’s only after doing cocaine which heightens anxiety. So I can avoid it but nonetheless it’s terrible
I’m anxious so this video touches my heart
I think i have reverse of this... My anxiety doesnt allow me to plan, doesnt allow me to prepare for the oncoming challenge... which puts me in a worse spot and thats a vicious cycle
This is rich famous celebrities alibi for theit bad attitude. Meh
I love this content.
Kendall: Right. Right.  Right. Right.
I don't understand why someone with this kind of personality would force herself in this stituation that is a person with anxieties worst nightmare. Why become a 'Kardashian' if it puts you in such a place of suffering. Could have just avoided it all together. It's just so ironic because it's not like she was forced down this path.  People all deserve to have their own problems without guilt. It's sad that people get shamed for having issues just because they are rich. A lot of rich people are absolutely miserable. At least this can help her cope and deal with her issues.
You have to experience things if you want to experience experiencing things ~ or whatevva she said
Dr Ramani is literally one of of best channels on YouTube in my opinion.
Anyone want to know a great cure for anxiety?     A net worth of over 44 million dollars.
Oh no. Kendall Jenner has anxiety. Maybe a face lift and a million dollars will help you through this trying time. Lets talk about it…
1:11 wait is that Harold?
Thank you for this video, Vogue. Kendall's always beautiful.
Just Spoilt ☺️
Hey Vogue maybe try interviewing normal people that don’t have millions and millions of dollars in the bank and willfully throw themselves in front of cameras. I bet your viewers would be able to relate to normal peoples life hardships compared to celebrities. Even then why not interview older celebrities out of the high point in their career and see how their mental health is affected. Just asking
Right
I always watch Kendall in shows and stuff and can relate to her because I have anxiety as well. I’m glad she came out with this it is very informative and does make me feel less alone in it. Love her! <3
like like um literally like like literally I was like
Thank you so much Kenny love you Jenner Godbless
Oh no Kendal’s anxious someone set up a go fund me for the poor kid
Thanku Kendall for opening up , u are really brave thanku
Wow Kendall looks insanely beautiful in this! Her make up is perfect I need to know every colour used!!
Social anxiety is incredibly scary. I'm so glad she's talking about this. Sometimes just interacting with strangers in the outside world brings me so much fear. It comes and goes.
I feel so bad for this billionaire that she feels bad sometimes. 😔😔😔 Maybe the ultra rich could cure that anxiety by paying their fair share in taxes.
Didn't she celebrate a Mexican holiday than most mexicans don't celebrate ??
🥰❤️
For a moment I almost believed her.
I have severe anxiety and depression, I dont think this show this it in any sort of real light being that shes very high functioning soo
Right
Thanks vogue
Loved this.
I Saw Dr. Ramani Before I Saw Kendall Jenner.🤣🤣🤣 The Queen Of All Things Related To Narcissistic Ab*se
What a horrible family shame in you for promoting them !
Is it just me or when she said she could relate to the question of anxiety caused by loved ones not being cautious of covid she was referring to kylie?
Well done Kendall, you are so authentic and you are so caring and beautiful inside and out. She deserves so much more credit- she is explaining to so many what anxiety actually is. It’s so important. Well done! So proud of you
I have ptsd and its caused severe anxiety. Its hard for me to be in public places, social events, etc. Sometimes  i feel like im dying
Do with Zayn, he experiences the most anxiety than any other
I’am happy that dr.ramani is getting all the attention that she deserves
No one's perfect, everyone has their own flaws which makes them stronger.
Open minded !
CBD oil helps my son so much.
Who's here because they're a long term Dr.Ramani supporter?!
THIS IS AMAZING! Please submit more of this 🤍😌
Welcome to the club
He...kendal... Lagu lu kaya topeng monyet
♡ Kendall , but shoutout to all the Indian people who have reached world class level in every field 🙇🏽‍♀️
Yeah. Okay. Yea. Right. Ok . Yea . Right. Right. Ha.
... she’s gained a LoT of weight. Like if you agree.
Kendall saying that loved ones not taking covid seriously is one of her anxieties is incredible because she literally threw a massive party mid pandemic celeb delusions~
Dr Ramani!!!!! ❤️❤️
This was a fantastic video.
Went in with low expectations and came out really pleasantly surprised. Very informative and honest look on anxiety in general. Looking forward to the next episodes.
Okay Dr. Ramni I see you ❣️
way to go ramani!
it’s interesting that she’s a hypochondriac AND struggles with social anxiety yet she decided to host a birthday party at the HEIGHT of the pandemic in LA with hundreds of people...seems EXACTLY like something that would immediately trigger both things easily. :|
Shes such a beauty
wow dr ramani is my fav youtube channel i watch her every day then all of a sudden i see this lol
The heart racing and thinking like something bad is going to happen is the worse. SMH.
Yes let us all sympathize for this child who's never had to earn anything in life, and like her parasitic sisters....is nothing more than a storage vessel for seminal fluid.
Practice celibacy atleast for 6 months...it is very effective method to overcome anxiety issues. Tried tested and trusted method.
Joke
Bravo Dr Ramani, you will shine even more now :)
1:10 harry styles🔥
If I was beautiful and a part of a multi million dollar family I would be pretty anxious too
Wow, she's so brave and relatable...oh c'mon people.
I know EXACTLY how debilitating anxiety can be. Kendall is such s strong woman 💝
Let the patient speak?
Rich people crying. I don't like discarding people but this one I will. She knows nothing about anxiety and the stress of everyday life, she's crying about anxiety on her private jet.
10 year old me feels valid
Kendall has never looked more beautiful.
Boohoo
Everyone always says that when they meet Kendall, she was rude. I have social anxiety too and it's not that we are trying to be rude, we are just scared and feeling judged.
Earlier I thought I had asthma because I keep short breathing when I perfomed or talk in public. It's weird. But that's it.
I'm so glad that you opened up about this, Kendall. Wish my family could watch this so that they could understand how bad mental health can affect us.
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT !!!  We need more of this.
She is the sweetest , the best , she is so brave that he survived his panic attacks , So proud of you Kenny  LOVE YOU 💓 💓
I felt alone with my anxiety and I feel like nobody understands me so thank you Kendall for sharing this, we love you<3
Me having anxiety, i’m like kendall because sometimes if i need to like participate by myself i can’t breathe at all like i have that time that i think i’m dying. Sometimes I overthink too much when anxiety comes through me and i have that time that my heart is beating so fast and i can’t stop it. For me anxiety attacks are not jokes cause it’s physical and it’s hard to deal with it when that time happens to every human being that is standing on earth, especially i get anxiety when i socialise with other people.
OMG I love Dr. Ramani.
Very true, and I love dr. Ramni, I watch her videos every day
She needs to go to someone who could do deliverance on her.  She's searching for answers  everywhere but GOD is the the ONE who can set her free. " He who the SON sets free is free indeed"
who in the world cares about this foolish, privileged girl.
1:10 whatt? hendall?🤣
This lady is really nice how she speaks
Love her for being opened about her anxiety. Not all are brave enough to do this. And to haters, please dont watch if you dont have good to say. Rich or poor we all have feelings and problems of our own. Spread love and peace!!!
My Kendall 😍
OMG WTF!... 1st world 🌎 problems! There are so many other things going on!  This girl needs to go to my hood and then she'll have some REAL anxiety!!!
God Bless You Sweet Girl!!!    This will help so many people!!!
I wish more people talked about anxiety and depression who doesnt have it everyone does not one single person doesnt
Like like like like like like
Thankyou for this episodes, Its really help me now, coz Im having a hard time now😥
I’m so tired of these celebrities talking about their anxiety. No one cares. Get out of the spotlight then bit**.
This was so insightful. Thank you to all involved for producing this very important content.
This video made me feel valid cos I go through the same stuff with my anxiety too
Him
Unsubscribe
So thankful Kendall did this. i definitely feel better knowing others feel the same especially Kendall. i hope everybody feels at ease right now!!! 🤍
❤
great video!
Dr. Ramani made me clicked this video. ❤️
I loved this, thank you <3
Wow never thought Kendall was like this. She seems normal to me now, not just a little rich girl. It’s as if I was hearing myself when she was talking.
kendall be like: right right right right yeah right right mmhm yeah
I believed about it until I experienced it. It is the worse feeling ever!
I spent all day today thinking about Kendall jenners anxiety... An now i know
I struggle with both depression and anxiety. It’s so hard to deal with and they both fluctuate with one coming after the other.
Hahahhs i love how she replies in every sentence like mhm, right, yeah, mhm
As someone who struggles with anxiety her words make me less lonely!
Anxiety is literally fearing fear. Makes you just stay in your comfort zone because everything feels like a threat. But in reality, there is no threat or danger. We're supposed to feel uncomfortable sometimes. That means we're growing. To battle anxiety, you have to learn to control what you know you can control.
OMG!!  Just realize I have social anxiety😨
Love Dr. Ramani! So wise, concise, and confident!
Once again Kendall proving to be the most down to earth Kardashian/Jenner.
Great topic,
Dr. Ramani is my hero. She saved my life.
When you're more excited by/starstruck by Dr Ramani than Kendall Jenner!
Oh look a rich person talking about there problems no one cares not like you're going to help anyone else dealing with it
Must be hard to be American royalty. The stress alone of never feeling financial strain would be too much for me.
Good job Kendall! I get what you’re feeling
i feel understood now. thanks
Dr. Ramani is phenomenal. ♥️
Im sorry but she said “right” like million times in this short video. 😬
God is watching your evil manipulative mind games. Shame on you!! There is a God and he s just!!
This is awesome to bring to the public. Medication and therapy helped me to eventually branch out and do things that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to do before getting help. Brought my head above water
Vogue keeps pushing this brain-dead kardashians... That family has obviously been paid to dumb down America while the elite keeps manipulating the masses.
OMG ITS DR RAMANIII
Anxiety is chronic but this A$$ is Iconic
Honestly she seems like the only one in that family to have a personality and a brain. I’ve always had sympathy for her and she def seems like the black sheep in her vapid world.
One concept, is that anxiety makes us aware of unresolved past issues we haven't resolved in our past and our body wants us to be prepared for in the future.
Both of you did an excellent job!
Dr. Ramani is the best I've come across. I've always enjoyed watching her.
Let's stop using privileged rich celebrities in 'Normalizing anxiety, panic attacks and mental illnesses and instead put that effort into finding out the root causes of these ailments..
This was so helpful, especially having really bad anxiety myself and for someone who’s been looking up to her since I was a teen!
The bends is a perfect way to describe the panic of going back to socializing, unfortunately for a lot of us the transition will be very abrupt 😕
Thank you for a very informative message. This doctor is awesome.
Dr. Ramani is great!
Going to share this link on my Facebook. Great interview. I’m so happy Dr. Ramani was a part of this.
I have a reallll hard time empathizing with people that spread the most toxic beauty standards ever known

No offense but Kendall is kinda vain and that doesnt really match up with being socially anxious. It’s actually quite the opposite.
This is exactly what I’ve been feeling. Had no idea that was anxiety. Thank you for sharing.
I am watching this as a fan of Dr. Ramani! She is a fantastic speaker and I am glad she is getting a larger platform to speak out on these topics.
When my anxiety is so bad I start sweating so bad and I have like a tight tummy that makes me unable to even swallow water ( sorry for my English)
♥♥♥
Thank you for sharing Kendall. Lots of people struggle with anxiety
stop using your phone so much and get off social media if you want to decrease anxiety in your life
Thank you for this. People react to my anxiety saying I'm immature. It is so hard to understand if you have not experienced it yourself.
wow i resonated with every sentence spoken in this video. love how young girls that look up to kendall will see this video and feel understood in their severe (or otherwise milder) anxiety
thereee he is harreh!!
So happy for Dr. Ramani!!! This is huge!!! Thank you for everything you do for us!!!
Let’s not forget she’s rich lol
Everybody needed to hear this!
Doctor Ramani is such an amazing presence, and always precise in her words <3
Wow this doctor is great, understands to a T Everyone needs to watch this so you can understand more about mental health
Thank you Kendall, thank you so much! I know it must be very difficult to expose yourself as you are doing. I appreciate with all my heart your effort, I love you ❤
te amo
When you’re anxious, your body is telling you something. Something in your life and/or brain chemistry is off.
I feel seen. heard. most importantly understood in me, myself. In 2020 I’ve had multiple panic attacks and didn’t understand what was happening, I thought I was dying. It would get so bad that I ended up in the emergency room mind you during a pandemic! Which I felt silly but I just didn’t know what was happening to me and even worse I couldn’t explain it. Finding minor techniques and build on that has definitely helped with the panic attacks. It’s made me look deep inside myself and my thoughts and brought a stable voice to tell me, “hey your okay, just breathe deep” small steps really take effect especially if you too are working this on your own.
The Harry Appearance  As he should
ALL the money in the world CANNOT make you happy.
Awww I love this. Kendall is a relatable queen
Yeah rich or poor, we all experience trauma, anxiety, and depression
this was very vulnerable, i admire that Kendall <3
Dr. Ramani you go girl! Do your thing we see you chica!!!
Queen 👑
Anxiety isn't a joke. It's a mind game which is hard to deal with 😭 I hope she can overcome it.
This was such a good interview! Kendall is beautiful inside and out.
Stop showcasing these people There are other people on planet earth
I love to listen to Dr. Ramani. She explains what its like to have  anxiety and is so knowledgeable. I am always left in awe after listening to her. Her knowledge and advice ways helps me. Thank you Dr.Ramani
Celebrity anxiety  vs ordinary people anxiety  is different . Celebrities use mental disorders  to be rude and get away with bad behavior or get out of business events.
Anxiety is so scary . I can't breath most times it's hard
No cap I learn more about anxiety in this video than I did in my school
Yeah Dr. Ramani is on Vogue youtube
this made me feel safe.
Welp, made me felt better with my life. Anxiety is a problem regardless of wealth. Back to being depressed in my yacht tho.
I feel seen
I love Kendall
For people without access to resources (like myself) these videos are very helpful. I just feel validated through this conversation and I thank Kendall for being open enough to have this talk.
Uncross your arms, make eye contact, and smile.  Good advice!  Now I just have to remember that 😂
Some people are cruel, unfortunately there are more of them every day. We have to not focus on this part of this negativity in our lives, we have enough on our minds. These famous people, we know just this part of them that they show to us. With the little we know about them, we CAN'T judge them or INTERPRET what they're going through.
I love Dr Ramani
Everyone has anxiety but I would be endlessly happy with even 100k
Yes, this is something I'm panicking about,  the getting back to "normal " and being around people in public again is really depressing to me
She wanted to some fun with the woman, I see that in her eyes, believe me I’m never wrong when I see something, by the way she talks and acts I know she likes that woman and I don’t blame Kendall the dr look good.
Is Kendall looking more and more like Kim?
So brave gurl✨ you made my day Kenny  We are not alone🗯  ♥️
I kind of knew it. She is one of the sisters who doesn't really show off although she is the most pretty one.
Poor little rich girl 💔
WOW! I love this interaction w Dr. Ramani ... there are millions of people struggling with anxiety me one of them 🥲 it’s hard to function on a day by day basis...
Oh how tragic—a gutter trash Kardashian has anxiety. Talk about gut wrenching! 🙄
Which one is Kendall Jenner? I'm confused...
Dr. Ramani  gets it 100%!!
I love Dr Ramani!!!!
Wow thank you so much for this. Dr. Ramani have very good points and advice. Thanks Kendall!
LOVE me some Dr. Ramani!! ♡♡♡
Yall remember when her mum had announcement we all thought was serious and it was acne cream they so overdramatic
Dr Ramani! She’s the best of the best.
I’ve spent YEARS trying to explain to people how I feel because of my anxiety and THIS explains it all. Thank u for this. Also, love you Kendal
Thank you Kendall for sharing your story. I have the same story as you that it's hard to deal with it.I am suffering too.
Yay! Dr Ramani is amazing!
Anxiety is horrible! It leaves you wanting to escape a moment even when you want to be present!
Money, popularity, looks, but still want to be relatable. Can kardashians stop acting like their life is very hard? Trying asking a Syrian kid, what is anxiety
Girl you dont know anxiety if it hit u
I feel you, thank you for sharing. This is something that affects many of us and knowing that someone out there feels like me it's so important.
I feel terrible for Kendall and Kylie in a way. They were children when KUWTK started, they had no say in the situation they were forced into. Yes, they've both taken the fame that was forced on them and turned it into viable careers for themselves. But it's not difficult to understand how they might have issues with anxiety and depression. Their formative adolescence was blasted into millions of people's homes every week and they had no control over what was shown, how they appeared, how they felt about it, nothing. Adolescent girls are SO self conscious even without a TV camera in their face all day. I just really feel sympathy for these two.
So happy y’all collabed I love med circle!
came for Dr. Ramani, left when Kendall asked that one covid question🙃
here's some tea Jeffrey Star watch this video.😁😅
This made me love Kendall more because I love how open she is about her anxiety.😭💕
I've once judged Kendall because of the Kim and Kanye and Taylor feud but then I realized that if I were in Kendall's shoes it must be hard living a life full of cameras everywhere and even photos of you in a personal life were taken and like relationships and problems can't be private because everyone is around you watching you and they expect you to be this perfect jeezz how scary is this generations I hope also everyone reading this may be happy in his/her life.
I never expected to connect with Kendall Jenner as much as I did in this video. I felt like I was there with them in the room. I am so glad they had this conversation, that too in depth, and shared it publicly. Love this!
Social anxiety is a hard struggle when u want to be able to open up to ppl and be friendly but it’s so overwhelming
It is difficult to be a public person as an INTROVERT
What a BEAUTIFUL girl inside and out. She seems human and normal. May God Bless her
meu deus gente video extremamente necessario ver que a kendall tambem passa por isso me da forças sabe de saber que eu nao estou sozinha
anxiety becomes a magnifying glass for negative things and it's so hard for me to just order at a restaurant which probably seems so normal to others but just for me i cant. i've cried while trying to order before and it's so frustrating to try and i have to have other people order for me
The harry video👀
I’m so nervous for when I have to see people irl after staying in my room almost 24/7 this past year😭🤚🏽
Kendall is my birthday twin and ugh, I relate
Where is Gal Gadot???This is GOLD!!!
proof that all the riches in the world means nothing prayers up to KJ
amazing!
Kendall I can relate too!!!
kendall you are best.Take care.
ANOTHER ONE🤤
Dr. Ramani you look so beautiful!!!!
No tea no shade. I find her take of covid interesting considering her bday party.
I also struggle with severe social anxiety everyday! I empathize with her!
DR Ramani on Vogue ❤❤❤👍
this is great but wish the episode was around 40minutes long
I struggle with social anxiety and panic attacks and it’s the worst , whenever I’m with other people I feel like I’m just making everyone feel bad or that they don’t want me there even if they are my friends my heart start raising and I feel like I run out of breath as well with my panic attacks they come when I don’t expect them and I start shaking and feeling like I can’t breath or even move and I think this is a topic that has to be more discussed , I’m really happy kendall is using her platforms and Influence to talk about this :)
Am so glad how Kenny open up about anxiety. Very honest sharing her experience about it. Hope and pray she will overcome this. ❤️☺️   #StrongKenny❣️
right.
It's hard for me at this young age I have been experiencing a lot like bullying and body shaming and it hurts me also that whenever I'm tryin' to fit in a group of friends I am that kind of a person that is always left behind then having this anxiety like  "Should I still come to them even though they feel like the friends I wanted" then having this depression "You should come with them you don't have any friends don't be lonely" it's hard to be honest
This resonated with me so much. I know exactly how she feels.  Thanks for bringing this video to the  public.
These girls know everything about marketing and this topic is trending specially now. I mean everybody has anxiety at some point. Why is she making it a thing? Bc it sells and this is what Kardashians are all about. BS
pain is pain & suffering is suffering doesnt matter your level of fame..
i didn’t know i related to kendall so much 😯
she's rich and goes out and parites, sure, she has an illness. it's embarrassing.
The only natural girl in the Kardashian family.
Bla bla ,all human beings have anxiety if she needs to retire already if she dnt want none of that
Why she do that to her lips?.... why?...
Just another under handed way for the Cashdarsians to manipulate and make money.
❤️❤️❤️
Love her opening up! Anxiety is something I  struggle with daily !!!
So Kendall Jenner is neurotic. Duly noted.
Me siento exactamente como ella describe. Es bueno saber que no estoy loca.
I could be a billionaire if I was given a dollar for every “right” Kendall said
Thanks for making this video
This was awesome! Thank you so much Kendall for sharing and I hope you’re okay
PLEASE,!!! Translate in spanish,!! 😉💛
Thank you for doing this
Good luck to Kendall with finding balance, to not mellow out so low to the point where there's no care in the world and it's irresponsible, yet not going to the extreme of spinning out of control into an anxious spiral which does no good.
Right, right,yeah, right,uhuum, right.  I would enjoy it if the therapist would not have to go so quickly through everything because Kendall is so impatient.
I love her she is so realistic
Loved seeing Kendall raw and honest ❤️ she’s so lovely!
Just a side note: the cinematography and the editing is great!
wow I like that therapist
Dr. Ramani is as authentic as they come. She's such a gem for this world. I'm so glad i discovered her Youtube Channel. At the end of the day, we are all human and have feelings regardless of privilege. Wishing Jenner well in her journey.
Thank you for this, Vogue. I hope Kendall, and the rest of us who also have anxiety, are able to overcome and conquer it. Sending love to all <3
Whenever I have attack, I thought I’m going to die
I’ve had an anxiety/panic disorder since I was 11 and I’m 26 now. I’m so happy she’s speaking out about this and I can relate so much, it’s definitely not a joke and terrifying what we go through. Doing a bit better now and know how to handle it at times 🙂
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Dr Ramani !!!! 💙💙💙 The best!!!
the covid question lol didn't she throw a huge birthday party during the pandemic and told her guests not to take pictures
Omg 😱😱😱 8 watch that doctor on youtube she is freaking amazing!!!
Billion dollar struggle??
“Overworked”
Right right right right right right right right right right right
Tbh I had anxiety my whole life since I was a child but being a teenager it has gotten worse and during quarantine it has gotten so bad,I had to tell someone because it was too noticeable. It’s really bad and sometimes I feel like crying under my mask when going outside. I love when people talk about this because it makes me feel less alone and more comfortable.
why does it look like kendall has no interest at all in this little sit down
No one:  Kendall: Right, yeah, uh huh
❤❤
Eye Contact is good unless your eyes are really big. Then it can become a bit uncomfortable.  😍
Jesus loves you Kendell! He loves us all
Kendall might be having some mast cell activation issues.
This was amazing , now more people can relate to Kendall.  My anxiety feels even worse than hers. Hey I’m a massive hypochondriac too!
I’m so glad she’s speaking about anxiety, I have it, I hate it, it’s killing me!
My panic attacks were physical i thought i was gonna die cause my heart was not doing ok ambulances took me so many times and sickness i felt i wanted to die and im the most scared person about death cause i could not handle the pain literally and only saver for me was medicine antidepresants i healed after a couple days after i took my medicines thank god
As someone dealing with anxiety,this made me happy that she is using this platform to speak out about this issue...the overwhelming feeling where you feel like you're running out of your breath is no joke...
I love thiss!!!!
Girl ain't nobody perfect... This isn't anything new. More folks should feel okay to get therapy.
This was the first time (for me) she has been relatable and not an eye roll. Well done
I love both of these women! So glad to see them in a video together, interacting
The topic is good but is it only me who noticed that kendall said "Right" so many times? lol
Kendall looks so much less like herself and so much like Kylie in this video.
Thank you for this. Well said and so true.
Me watching tons of videos about social anxiety because I have no one to reach up to. And not to mention the fact that talking is a bit of a grueling job for me. This kinda help 🤝
I saw Dr. Ramani , I click 😇❤️
*right*
Shout out to Kendall Jenner and Vogue for doing something impactful and relatable like this...zero words for how comforting it’s been to hear the words of others.
💙
who else is a teen with extreme anxiety?
This was so therapeutic to listen to
I started crying the second they sat down and talked..I've never related so much in life but my parents never understood me, and SO MANY THINGS STARTED TO MAKE SENSE THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO
No wonder they call her Kenduh Dumber
Thank you Kendall, Vogue and Dr Ramani for this!
Loved this & huge thank you to Kendall for opening up & being so vulnerable putting this out there
Wow.
ik it doesnt have anything to do with de subject (btw the video reallyyyy good) but i find it funny that they put her and harry styles idk maybe it just me
I struggle with TAG disorder and I fully understand that part when kendall talks about people using the term anxiety loosely. It's so annoying
Proud of you
Now it's more clear as to why Dr. Ramani won't speak out about the scamdemic and how we're being gaslighted and subjugated by dark triad elites, it's because she's ready to go prime time with the narcissists! What a sellout.
Dr. Ramani hanging with the narcissists, yikes.
Interesting to see Dr. Ramani speak with someone who helped usher in narcissism to mainstream culture on a massive level and say nothing. #phonies
Anxiety keeps me safe so I almost don’t want to be medicated for that reason smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
just because she is a celebrity doesn't mean its easier for her to deal with her anxiety . its really hard to deal with it and no one should be criticised for it❤❤
I love the attention being given to mental health now. Its so underestimated🤔
I’m a simple girl ! I see Dr Ramani l click ! Love the view through the window ! Thanks for sharing!
Thanks for your bravery and honesty Kendall, great content
7:21 wow such a hypocrite. her and her entire family have been immature partying and throwing parties. I can’t stand any of them, they act like it’s the end of the world since they had to be “isolated” but were never isolated in the first place
I love how more people (especially celebrities) are now openly discussing mental health struggles including anxiety and depression! EXCELLENT content
No lo pueden subtitular?
Kendall thank you for open with us about your journey, this conversation is so important for everyone who is dealing with anxiety, i don’t feel alone anymore
This is a very important video ! Tysm
Dr. Ramini is the best
no one: kendall after the doctor says anything: right
Omg I stand by mentally preparing for everything.  I’m also early to everything.
I’m glad Kendall is speaking out about this! It gives me a lot of anxiety even coming out about it and telling people that I have anxiety. I give her props for delivering well!! Hope to see more.
Yes! This is what I've been waiitng for, for Kendall to speak on her struggles with this to inspire and lift up others, such as myself, who deal with the same thing. Thank you Kendall!!
This is amazing! So so important to be aware and be vulnerable. I loved it! Thank you for sharing 💛♥️
Just throw the whole family away.this is bizarre. What therapy session has a fan question segment
I want Dr. Durvasula to be my doctor.
we need more
I love that mental health is a topic that is being more talked and acknowledged, as a person who suffers depression and Ed, is nice to know that you’re not alone 💚
Dr. Ramani is a gift and I’m so glad to see her expertise recognized in this series.
I remember a restaurant hostess doing “reviews” of famous people who came into her restaurant. She said Kendall didn’t say a word and the other person ordered for her. She was implying Kendall was a diva/snob. It was probably the poor girl’s anxiety.  #judgenot
i can fully empathize and understand her struggles with anxiety.... but if the pandemic caused her to have bad anxiety when she started being around people... why did she throw a giant party with 100+ people and no masks? or go to a private island with a bunch of family members/friends?
I have never related to something relating to anxiety and hypochondria more. It makes me feel heard as well as not alone.
crying because it's so relatable :(
This is so needed. Thank you❤️
Dr Ramani & Kendall Jenner. What an odd combo lol
Whoa this video describes me
*this is so good omg i wish vogue start making more of these it help so much !  ❤💕*
Bruh 😂
she low key looks like Kim here
Thank you guys for putting this up, even if being a doctor I can feel this in similar way, cause I have anxiety disorder, which is completely fine, everyone has psychiatric components more or less different ones, easy and difficult but everything should be on discussion, people have to open about these,, every component of psychiatry has some therapies and there are many non allopathy therapies as well, what so ever in today’s world we really have to be open up about these and share our thoughts, in this way it would be easy to solve this out together.. Love to All Xoxo
Thank you for opening up! I felt so lonely and misunderstood when I had an anxiety disorder, I went through it all by myself and concurred it with the help of my therapist (no medication) after 13 years, I'm so proud!
she looks just like her mum
Dr Ramani!
Ramani is the best.
babe you threw a party during the pandemic. stfu
Not me realizing I have anxiety🙃
Thank you
mais do que nunca nós precisamos falar sobre os nossos sentimentos, sejam eles positivos ou negativos. 👥🧠💙
Proud of you Kenny ❤️
Everything Dr.Ramani explained was a perfect representation of what I experience daily. It sucks when you're hanging out with friends and feel drained or excessively judged by surrounding individuals. My body gets hot, shaky, and clouded with negative "what ifs" and etc. Can't wait to see what this series brings!
Very helpful video. Thank you
I’ve never related more to a video 🤍
Finally Dr Ramani is getting the recognition she so much deserves!!!
Not y’all capitalizing on her anxiety lol
I am so grateful for Dr. Ramani and Kendall spreading information about social anxiety ❤️  that way we can better accept ourselves or  be more understanding to everyone else around that has anxiety🤗  You two are inspiration🤩
Free therapy sessions. Thanks
This is amazing! And I’m sure a lot of girls and women can relate to this.
Ughh I love Dr Ramani , she has impacted my life in many ways already !!🤘🏾🤘🏾
I actually feel sorry for people that are raised in celebrity families as they never get a chance to grow up & do usual things kids do without being followed by paparazzi or having strangers take photos of them on their phones to show friends. They even get snapped just getting groceries ):
Hi! I would absolutely reccommend TFT Thought Field Therapy which includes tapping, and "cleansing" and reprogramming the nervous system and brain responses. It works magic for anxiety, phobias and other heightened emotional triggers! Ive tried a lot of different modalities concerning my anxiety and that works the best till now!😊 🙌❤️
ok but DR RAMANI IT'S ON VOGUE Y'ALL.  Love Dr. Ramani, so happy to see her getting the recognition and success she deserves.
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY NUMB PERSON IN THE WORLD
Another millionaire celebrity talking about their anxiety&how their world isn't perfect. Oh my heart bleeds for her, poor dear.
Please more videos like this one @vogue this is what we really need. Thank you!
Love Dr. Ramani! 💖
Oh yeah she was soo isolated.. Do u guys remember the big party she had on this island with so many others Kylie etc? Oh right she was so isolated..
can she please be my therapist? mine hasn't even called me back in like 4 months
Kendall always misses the mark when she’s trying to do things like this.
we want a part 2 :) !!
Dr. Ramani 🥳🥰
I'm battling with the same..
Kendall Jenner eres mi inspiración te amo y se que algún día te conoceré y te podré abrazar y modelar a tu lado
OMG dr. Ramani
i hope she donates to mental health institutions in north america cuz god knows people need it right now
Thank you Kendall and Vogue for talking about this 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Loved this interview! Kendall and dr. Ramani did amazing!
Necessary. Vogue and Kenny lady, thank you. 💗
So crazy, came on youtube to look up anxiety coping techniques.. and this was waiting for me on my homepage 🙃
Right right right right...
I like those two homan
This is was great
Thank you kendall it was actually very enlightening for me ☺️
1:10 wow didn't see that one coming 💀
This content is what I need right now, not the tiktok people thumbnails that appear in vogue. Thank you Doctor Ramani and Kendall.
didn't she have a birthday party with like a hundred people in covid times...
People think that because someone is rich they don't have the right to have problems or mental issues but like...that don't even makes sense
I think it is wonderful that she is sharing.
I deal with three things, depression, social and general anxiety disorder.  My family is super caring, loving and understanding, we also have no economical problems. And yet I developed these problems, you don’t always have to go through something traumatic or bad to develop them. And it’s so bothering when people point the things I mentioned before. Like: “Oh but you have a great family and no money problems and blah, blah, blah.” It’s not my fault I developed them. 😐
I love her but when she was saying about seen more of her friends was making her have anxiety... didn’t she had a huge birthday partyY?
These celebs always make the mockery of the word "Anxiety".
Oh my goodness! love
nice to see her be vunerable, it helps people
It doesn't matter how great your life is anxiety doesn't discriminate
Thinking celebrity would reduce the likelihood or severity of anxiety makes no sense.  Having anxiety myself, the thought of being under a microscope since childhood and having to appear a certain way/ dealing with paparazzi and stalkers, ect. sounds like a nightmare.
RIGHT.
Okay but be nice to people next time, love.
thank you so much for this
Dr. Ramani is a Saint I love her ❤
Ughhhh how I wish I studied under Dr. Ramani at school but never 😭 so amazing how big her platform has become
Im beyond impressed VOGUE. Well done. This is the realest version of Kendall I have ever seen. This video felt like its really genuine and not staged at all and you can see how kendall is genuinely interested and dedicated to this topic when she is talking with the doctor. Loved it loved it !!! We have too discuss this type of content where the videos are real and topics are relatable to everyone. Especially during the covid times !!
She seems the most normal ( of that's possible ) out of the family.
Sooooo good !!!
I wanna know what snoopa diving is now
Everyone has anxiety it’s normal!
the tone of the energy in this video is really great. there's an incline towards healing and good mental-health knowledge. thank you, Vogue.
she looks really uncomfortable in the picture omg
It is wonderful that she is willing to share this knowing full well that so many will try to minimize what she feels because of the life she has.  But dysfunction is dysfunction, and talking about how it can happen to even the most privileged among us will make more people aware of how real it is.
This whole video makes me cry not bad tears but I feel so understood by this video. Kendal Thankyou for being so open and honest. This is going to help so many people ❤️
i don’t know why people hate on her so much she is going through things that we don’t know about and we have no right to judge her
Being a hypochondriac this is so relatable.
"hardest thing of all is to feel alone" 10:41 💯
wow I didnt think this would move me to tears... ughhh i feel her !!!!
Woah this one hits for real... seriously thought i was totally alone. This helped so much!! Thanks Kylie:D
the way they had the iPhone alarm sound in the beginning was triggering lmao
Here for Doctor Ramani 💖💖💖
I just experienced my anxiety about my anxieties of being social again post Covid, getting back to normal makes me scared and nervous as all get out. Meanwhile watching everybody else being excited to return to being social and social activities.. Feels terrifying to me.
wow, she looks like Kim in this video
go off ramani amazing stuff
Anixety is a near death experience.
She is soooooo pretty <3 love you
She is so intelligent and sensible! ❤️ I love that she's doing this more power to her
Thank You Kendall For Sharing❤️🙏🏻
I’ve had social anxiety for a while and have never sought treatment or therapy for it but when she said that socially anxious ppl are afraid of ppl looking at them and feel like they are doing judgeable things, wow that is so spot on for me. Proud of this being talked about more and more in spaces like these.
anxiety is one of the hardest things to fight about, kendall is very strong. like she said, at the end of the day it doesn’t matter if she have a lot of money, she still is person with real feelings and emotions.
I'm here for Dr. Ramani, she is the best!! 💕
This was awesome to watch. I have terrible anxiety
I knew I was an anxious person but not to this extent until I began relating to everything Dr. Ramani was saying
It’s easy to assume they have the perfect life but even someone as beautiful and rich as her struggles with anxiety 🥺
Wow kendall looks alot like her young self here !
I needed this so bad omg
Finally a positive comment section about Kendall! Celebrities are human too and are never going be perfect, sometimes people just need to put themselves in other peoples shoes celebrity or not, we all have struggles.
It's hard to deal with anxiety when u r constantly in the public eye.. all the best to her🙂
Wouldn’t it be great if instead of sharing her story, that Kendall used her wealth to professionally deal with and learn invaluable tools she could pass on. I feel this with many famous faces who speak of anxieties. With most, professional tools help deal with most conditions. But most of us don’t have the access. It feels to me, it’s a buzz topic and people with incredible wealth and celebrity are using this as a reach to appear normal. I’m not saying their issues aren’t real. But to really effect change is to be proactive in gaining tools to overcome and share with others.
I feel like there wasn’t a lot of analysis to the solving the anxiety part , maybe I’m wrong idk
I love this woman. No one I have met has explained anxiety in the way I feel it.. until now
Right. Yeah.
Love this, i think this is Such an important conversation
i really needed this one today
Why did I think this video was going to be a joke by the title lmao it was a actually a good video
I really adore Dr Ramani’s well spoken, good tips and advices towards anxiety  Also, Kendall is so brave!
it helps to hear such stories and advices... thank you
♡
The best tip I've had for social anxiety are exercises that take you out of your head and into the present physical moment, like noting 5 things in the room that you can see, hear, touch, smell and taste. Similarly focusing on other people in the room and how they feel, rather than what they are thinking about you. Also deep slow breathing is magic, can literally feel it calm me physically by the second.
Kendall the whole time “yeah” “right”
Kendall I completely relate to how you feel and have felt even if we grew up differently
Clicking this only for Dr Ramani
Kendall is one of the most down to earth celebrities who really appreciates everything she has. Lover her! Such an awesome role model
DR RAMINI !!!!
I think I have a anxiety disorder and my parents will just brush it off and say I’m not exercising enough and it hurts so bad because I know it’s just going to get worse
Is not that we expect you to not have any issue or human feeling is just the fact that you have absolutely everything a human can strive for in life, you were born with all the privileges that exist: money, looks, skin color, connections, etc. You could do absolutely everything you want since you were a child with zero limitations, open up a business that’s most likely to be successful because of all the connections your family has, that right there is a privilege most humans don’t have… that’s why is baffling to find you still not happy or content with that you have… yes you are physically capable of feeling sadness, anxiety, depression and whatnot we know that you’re still human, still it will always be funny and not sit right with us the average folk how you are out of all people feeling this way… I think your parents failed you to ground you and tell you how it really is out there for the average human and now since you’re an adult is your responsibility.
I LOVE YOU KENNY🦋💗
I LOVEE THISS💘
Every symptom she experienced and stated in the beginning is exactly everything I’ve felt with anxiety as well. In fact there was this one day I remember where I woke up thinking I couldn’t breath and now I know it’s anxiety but I had that all the time to the point where I went to the hospital twice bc I thought it was real. I also have had heart pains, and numbness and shakiness with anxiety, and I’m also a huge hypochondriac, nothing happens in my body w out my feeling it LOL
YES BRO!!!!!
This doctor always gets me together.
This helped me so much, thank you so much
Just do shrooms. 🥰🌈😃
I'm here for Dr Ramani
Dr. Ramani is the best!  Thank you Kendall for doing this.
Hey.. at least you know: if you are someone who struggles with anxiety, you would be the *fittest to survive* in an environment humans are actually meant to live in
great content. thank you vogue!
How should I handle anxiety over a loved one who isn’t being cautious during COVID? “Wow I feel this” Ofc you feel it you are the one who isn’t cautious
I’m so glad I got recommended for this video. I have been feeling anxiety like her, literally thinking you are going to die and something is really wrong with your body. I have this due to being sick and thinking I have sort of PTSD to feel the same way again. I am at that point where it really interupts my relationship with other people.. this irrational fear.. I am so glad knowing I am not alone and knowing that someone like Kendall could actually feel like that is somehow making me less scared
Can I just say she’s the only Kardashian I like!!!!!😂😂😂😂
Im gonna watch it again and count how many times did Kendal says ‘Right’
That explains it. I used to see her walking the runway and she looked disconnected and unhappy.
oof kylie.. Glad im not the only one.
The best Dr Ramani 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love Dr. Ramani
Meditation. Thousands of years of collective programming which needs to be cleared out, surrendered, to deprogram and defragment our system.
hy·po·chon·dri·ac  noun a person who is abnormally anxious about their health
It is mostly a thing with our environment I experienced it myself and made some clear decisions that helped me to create a better place for me. Kendall is a lovely woman I feel like this anxiety is giving her even more awareness to grow as a person. Dr. Ramani, she knows the subject.
i love this
i'm so happy vogue is doing this series. anxiety needs to be normalized and I think having a big celebrity like Kendall Jenner be apart of these videos will make people feel less strange for being anxious.
Fare play to her opening up about it 👏
Oh my gosh 😭
I'm hoping that we're okay 🥰🤗
The flip side of being so hyper aware of our bodies and thoughts and feelings is the capacity for self-knowing, physical intelligence and emotional intelligence! ❤️
BUT WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH FASHION........ This wold be a better video to be covered by another channel that specializes in mental health.
Oh wow many things that she mentioned I also experience, hypochondria, anxiety and panic attacks.
Ty Kendall !!! This helps young girls I. Our society
I always knew she had anxiety.   That's why we don't see a lot of her personality cause she doesn't want people to judge her for who she is. Also people with anxiety are usually very private about their lives.
Listening to this doctor was so calming she’s amazing imma go check her out and see if she has other videos!
I have a lot more respect for Kendall now.
Kendall Jenner HAS NEVER BEEN SCUBA DIVING?!
Being on time is such a great advice. I just can't stand thinking someone is waiting for me. I get so anxious. I'm always rushing so I'm on time.
Love all these tips. Thank you!
Dr. Ramani!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Wow. I can relate to the symptoms too. Thank you Kendall, your authenticity is the best
❤️
LOVE
She has the most beautiful eyes on the planet
This video really helped me to understand anxiety better. My parents are Russian and they are totally against any medication for mental health. I brought it up multiple times to my mum about my panic attacks and anxiety during the night, it started happening to me a few months ago (I recently turned 18), where I would fall asleep and wake up two hours later scared. My heart would beat very fast I would stand up and wash my face in cold water or open the window and breath the fresh cold air to sober up into a normal mental state. I told her about it, and she just blames me for being too much on my phone or cuz of my lifestyle. It really irritates me, IDK how to get through to her that I need the medication because I'm genuinely tired of feeling this way and waking up the next day tired or being afraid of going back to sleep. The worst part about the anxiety I really think that I'm going to die. I just want to feel normal again.
Really enjoyed this conversation and knowing this side of Kendall. Thank you!
Kendall is so gorgeous tbh and brave to share her story
I don’t think i’ll ever overcome my anxiety. My anxiety is based around my walk and having a disability. My walk is already different but it gets worse whenever I go out anywhere in public.  Anything I do I feel people are judging me and talking about me but most of the time I actually am getting judged. I’ve been bullied my entire high school middle school years. This is really just gonna be an everyday thing where I have panic attacks bc i just my heart starts racing, i can’t breathe and i have to stop and pretend I’m doing something else.
but why her idk couldve picked someone else just my opinon but thank god its not a tic toker this time
Here for dr ramani
♏️ 💜
I love Dr Ramani, mental health stigma does need to be addressed I’m going to be honest I came into this video being critical of Kendall
Wow literally how she feels is how I feel. Whether your celebrity or not everyone can get anxiety. I never thought I would but I did x
U don't have anxiety babe U have mood swings
Came here for Dr. Ramani.
Thank you Vogue for this, I finally feel understood. x
this is awesome this conversation it is so important I really aprecciate Kendall for talking about and thanks Vogue for giving us the plataform wishing all the best for her
Kendall is just like us but with money.
I seriously do not like Kendall but yes anxiety is real for everyone at times, I can understand how she may have social anxiety.
Vogue needs to do this with Dr. Daniel Amen. The celebrity psychiatrist to the stars!
i love kendall
This doctor is great. She explains everything so understandably.
Right.
the courage she has to do this is very admiring
This is genuinely so important, like how many people in the public eye talk about this and have first hand experience of it?
related to this so much !
Right right right yeah yeah yeah right right right yeah yeah you’re right yeah yes right right right right yes yes you are right right right
Girl just let her talk without you saying MMMM right yes yes yeaaaa
If you haven't checked out Dr. Ramani's YouTube channel, please do so. She helped change my life. Lisa A. Romano's channel is also wonderful.
Kendall seems very genuine and likeable. And Dr R is amazing as ever. Thank you for sharing this. Very helpful.
I don't believe there's nothing that's impossible to overcome. But if the mind acts in a certain way and body in another, what do u do Dr Ramani
Vogue is making this video 3x speed
Felling understood and like you are not alone is really the most comfortable feeling ever
Great Job Kendall! Keep being a light. Keep sharing and giving us a new way to approach our mental health.
spread love ♡
Did she really have to do an interview wearing a blazer with no top on underneath!!!
This is so helpful
Really really enjoyed the explanation of Anxiety in this discussion. She touched on so many aspects of it that are overlooked and destigmatized it. Everyone's anxiety is valid at every level, just try and find out what helps you handle it! And make sure you are taking the right steps to ensure your mental health is being handled well cuz that is your job and you owe it yourself!
Is it just me or did y'all see the clip of her and Harry styles 🤩😍😍😍😍
1:02 she looks so cute
Various 5 minute "EFT tapping" free videos on youtube help me with the daily anxiety I face.  It calms the nervous system and the mind and gives you a way to process through every emotion without wasting the whole day stressed out.  I hope this helps someone else.  God bless.  (I often use the Brad Yates channel cuz he had thousands of tapping video topics that get right to the point).
Omg she looks so much like Kim, she could pass as kims daughter
I’m so glad she’s brave enough to let us in  This was an extremely important conversation
I was so thrilled when I saw Dr. Ramani in on this!!
You should probably put trigger warning on opening since a lot of sensitive people will watch this
Oh Kendall, I feel so sad for her childhood. To develop anxiety so early is so devastating. She is such a champ finishing through it all and facing it so she can follow her dreams and her job. I feel that as a child, I was surrounded by a lot of changes, lack of safety and perhaps lack of predictability and that also caused me to be hyper sensitive, have anxiety, need to control and over analyzer everyone and myself included. Highly functioning anxiety is exhausting.
I wish there was a lesson at school where we could talk about anxiety struggles. It would really help lots of people
Can we just appreciate the fact how brave Kendall is to do this. Especially since she wants other people know that they’re not alone.
Only here for Dr. Ramani.
I can relate to kendall so much
Yo sufro de ansiedad lamentablemente pero admiro mucho a Kendall que hable sobre esto me hace sentir tan bien que estrella favorita comparta esto🥺
i think this is so important for people to see, to normalise celebrities having anxiety and just show that it happens to everyone and that you’re never alone with it
Anyone who says "what does she have to worry about?" clearly doesn't understand anxiety in the slightest.
Ty for the advices i really appreciate that
At 1:11 is my favorite pt with Harry Styles aka my mans💗
Thank you for sharing your story🙏
Dr. Ramani! <3
Thank you for thin interview, ive got axiety issues too and i needed to hear this
Ty for the advices because i can't afford to go to a doctor like that
Take a shot every time Kendall said right.
Boring. This narcissist doesn’t care.
Quiz by the NHS about anxiety :) https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/depression-anxiety-self-assessment-quiz/
I’ve had anxiety for so much of my life that it can be hard to make friends because I get anxious meeting new people! It can be hard at times to smile and come off friendly when I’m battling an internal struggle with my anxious thoughts and worries. I’ve been told I’m stuck up and those first impressions used to really affect me. Now, I’m kinder to myself and I don’t worry about what others think of me because it makes my anxiety worseeeee. I’ve gotten a lot better with my anxiety and recognize when I’m in an episode and know to avoid people and just recollect myself privately. If it comes off wrong, it’s not my responsibility to fix it. My responsibility is my mental health, not to sway others’ opinion of me into a positive one.
10:37 you could see it in her eyes even tho she didn’t utter a word
I love this !
Watching this gave me anxiety.
1:11 omg I miss them
What a beautiful conversation, very informational and relevant
no one :  Kendall : RIGHT
Me: googling what snuba diving is lol Also props for her for opening up about this, knowing that this will potentially be received negative and haters will hate.  Can't wait for the next episode!
I'm not surprised that she struggles with anxiety considering that she's been in the public eye since being a child and then has been under constant pressure and scrutiny as a model. I wish she and her family understood how they and their media team are contributing to millions of young women feeling anxious and uncomfortable with their bodies due to having this perfectly manicured, airbrushed image, not to mention all of the plastic surgery they're denying. I wish her well and hope this can be a wake up call to transition to showing a more real side of her since many young women seem to look up to her.
I love this sooo much
I really appreciate Vogue doing this series. More important conversations than ever and helped me understand both my friend and my own situations. Just subscribed and looking forward to learning more. Sending blessings!
yess dr ramani!! huge fan....kendal’s cool too lmao jk
This reminded me of the time Kim kinda made fun of her anxiety struggles. Really hurt my feelings cause people don't understand ❤️ pray everyone dealing with it heals, you too Ken 🙏
Everyone literally thinks she’s rude but I think that’s just her anxiety. She’s been in the spotlight since she was like 9 and whenever anyone has something to say about her or her family it’s always negative. I feel like she just has her guard up and puts on a face because she thinks everyone hates her. I love her and I’m glad she’s doing this series.
Love her and love that we’re talking about this 🤍
This is honestly helpful for anyone going through anxiety ❤️❤️. Sending love to anyone who is experiencing it as it can really feel overwhelming. God is always with you. Prayer really does help. ❤️❤️
Thank you so much for this.
Why don’t we talk about the anxiety of the average jo. The anxiety of the real struggle of life that people have to deal with silently. Everyone talking about ‘well done Kendall courage to speak up’ no it’s not courage it’s incredible privilege and being given an incredible platform for you’re voice to be heard at any given time. The people who have no platform are those with courage and integrity.
As kendall said being blessed with the *best life* doesn't solve problems like this.As a person who have been struggling with anxiety for years please be patient and kind to people who have anxiety disorders.💗It's not easy and you  can't control it! Stay safe everyone💗
Kendal is brave to talk about it in public..and the psychologist is a nice lady. Intelligent and understanding towards others
Watching this gives me so much comfort tho, especially since it’s Kendall.
It must be scary having anxiety and being a celeb. You're scared that people are watching and judging you.. When in fact, they actually are.. So it's not just in your head
Dr. Ramani, is one of the most intelligent women on the planet. She is just such an expert in her field.
hi harold
I really needed this video today- thank you so much for sharing this I enjoyed watching a lot 🖤
❤👍
What some people don’t understand is that anxiety can’t be shut off. It always just there lingering and we feel it, it’s just horrible.
thanks kendall oh my god
I’m never gonna forget that week when my anxiety went so high that I felt like I was having a heart attack- all for what?  A freakin dinner party-
i love kenny but hate her lip fillers😭
Therapy is expensive so thanks for the free session haha
Seeing Dr. Ramani here makes me so happy 🖤 thank you Vogue for including her in this video!
I couldn't have said it better myself!!
She looks like kim here
why tf are there ads on this?
Thank you for defining and giving terms to the overwhelming feelings that I have been persistently experiencing for half of my life. I’ve always felt like something was wrong with me. Though I know I cannot diagnose myself, at least it gives me assurance to know that there are others battling on the same ground and to seek professional help whenever necessary.
What we need to remember while watching this..is she's not only opening up about her anxiety..  1. she's opening up FACE TO FACE with someone,  2. opening up WHILE RECORDING,  3. and opening up with the intentions on  MILLIONS of people of hear her words... takes guts.  So much respect for you kendall
It makes me feel better if Kendall can have such a successful career and be able to fly around the world and do her jobs I feel like I can do it too :)
I don't particularly watch anything about kendall or her fam shows etc. But I just had a full panic and anxiety attack... before opening You tube... It's hard to judge someone who's life is almost on camera.. she's living with anxiety like I do and I feel so connected  when watching this
I love this so much❤️ Ive struggle with anxiety and this helped so much
Not Kendall acting like milder forms of anxiety aren’t significant and can’t be addressed. You’re not a special butterfly in the sky lol
I love her so much!
“Anxiety only magnifies the bad things” wow I had to hear that one again ...
I wonder if she actually likes what she’s doing in her life right now and if she had other aspirations
She even ADDRESSES here blessings, she's aware but still struggles. I want to hug you so much until you feel no pain ❤
thank you kendall (hope you can conquer and live more peaceful) 😌❤
I like Dr. Ramani so much. I love to listen how she communicates.
They couldn’t have picked a better psychologist to interview someone of this magnitude.
kendall just explained everything i feel and think everysingle day .
Kendall. Everyone has anxiety. Everyone. This feels like a proactiv hidden secret repeat. stop trying to get sympathy
I really do want to connect with her/ feel for her and all but I honestly can't get myself to. This entire family lies wayyyyy tooo much. I am in way doubting her story but getting plastic surgery and everything done to look this amazing and then going on camera to say that she doesn't is just straight up annoying. Do these people realize how many other girls have they caused to feel bad about themselves and caused anxiety in a way, by not being honest.  It is their body and they are allowed to do whatever they want with it, but don't lie about it if you care about your fans and their mental health.   Bringing light to mental issues is great and kudos to her for having the courage to share her story but maybe not just talk about it? Dig deeper into the issue!!
There is this one little thing that can be tricky and is the be prepared thing, here’s what it is: you can’t control everything and even if it’s a great copy mechanism and helps in specific situations like showing up on time or being aware of who is going to attend, we have to face that sometimes there are external factors playing a role on it, so yes be prepared but also be prepared for not being able to be prepared.
Being a celebrity would break me completely.
This helped me feel not alone, thank you❤️
This warms my heart, opens my eyes, and touches my views on people.
Thank you so much Kendall for talking about this! This is a topic that gets brushed under the rug a lot but it’s very important. Thank you I again. ❤️
OMG, it's Dr. Ramani!!! LOVE her so much!!
Turkish translatee 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Dr Ramani is a legend .
I always felt like Kendall had such a bad attitude. Now I’m realizing we are much more alike than not. I know I’d never be able to survive as a celeb like her.. I respect her a lot more after being so vulnerable.
social anxiety is something which starts tearing you down but you can’t really talk about it because you don’t want to be looked down at! and then people think you’re rude !!!
I love Dr Ramani
It think that something so special about Kendall Jenner is that her personality and look has always stayed the same 💗
DR. Ramani!!!!! Kendall doesn’t realize how lucky she was
Okay @ Kendall saying people use the term anxiety lightly when her sister Khloe literally calls herself KHL-OCD lmao
wow im so glad she got the courage to share this, i struggle with the same anxieties as her and my dream is becoming a supermodel. But anything i do my anxieties are so bad i start to worry so much i just don't get motivation to do it anymore. i feel like im so alone with it and her sharing this made me feel so much better it was like someone finally understands.
She is so brave, thank you Kendall.
Doctor Ramani has such relaxing voice
Wow I resonated with this so much thank you Kendall!
Love Dr Ramani
Underestimated beauty at it's finest 🤯🥳
So because shes rich she cant have problems? There are lots of things money cannot solve!
Wow people put her on this epitome of perfection and her talking about it so comfortably is just so beautiful.
Proud of you Kenny!
Anxiety is the hardest thing to overcome and grasp, props to everyone out there who is getting treated or creating a conversation! :)
Shout-out too the AMAZING Dr. Ramani!
anybody can experience anxiety and I'm not trying to minimize her experience with anxiety cuz it's really hard to live with! but girly has not been isolated this year lol. Kim's private island birthday bash, and Kendal's own birthday bash with other celebrities that she told not to post on social media.... just a bit out of touch.
I'm so happy that I'm not alone. Sending all the love I have to kendall.  Thank you for inspiring me and helping me and so many more people to get stronger 💓
I feel you...breathlessness and numbness! It's scary! Good on you for being open... the part when you mentioned headaches,  I have had headaches researching thinking it was what you mentioned 😮 we really do overthink!
The doctor is amazing honestly
I feel her. I've terrible anxiety too and I can never really talk about it..
I had to search the suicide hotline of my own country because some days are just bleak, you know. i just appreciate these conversations more and more, because I feel like i dont have anyone to talk to about that, u know.
Kendall you are Gorgeous 😻
I used to scroll through her insta pics dreaming of how it would be like to live like her or look like her, but then I realized she's struggling with the same things that I do.
I posted my actual real raw emotions to this video twice now and it’s been deleted... glad to see only “love for Kendall” is allowed on this video and not truthful feelings can be shared. Whatever.... hoping nothing but the worst for this girl. She deserves to know what it’s like to not have a perfect life.
Say “right” again Kendall. I dare you, I double dare you
I love it when celebrities talk about their own issues in life because we're always used to labeling them as perfect.
Dr ramani on vogue😍😍
Anorexia and bulimia nevrosa videos  please please🙏 open minded series
It’s so refreshing to see someone as famous as her speak on this and share their own struggles. Especially someone like Kendall who so many people see as unattainably perfect. Great reminder that we’re all human and you are not alone.
Dr Ramani: Explains everything thoroughly and calmly  Kendall: RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT
Excellent interview! I feel anxiety just by watching Kardashians and other successful people live,it looks so exhausting... meeting constantly the demands of others profesionally, being in the limelight privately as well... I feel so blessed with my modest normal life...
And they ask me why she's my favorite kardashian/jenner.
I used to never have anxiety and I didnt even understand it until one night I was at a restaurant with my friends and I got this overwhelming feeling of discomfort and fear so I went to the restroom to calm down and halfway there I passed out. Ever since that night I’ve felt anxious about not feeling in control over my body and it’s really changed my life and I get random anxiety attacks and it’s just crazy but I’m slowly improving and trying to live in the moment because I’m tired of letting my fears and anxiety control me!
Having anxiety is not an excuse for being rude ,racist...and insensitive she barely shows up on time for any gig shoves the staff only hangs out with people who are on the same level of fame whatever that means .But what’s shocking is that people take silence for poise when it’s not
So grateful for this!
I could never survive being a celeb
Kendall: right
Thank y'all for doing this!!!
Vogue this is the quality content we need ❤️ More power to Kendall for finally opening up.
i hope she gets to overcome her anxiety, having anxiety and having so much pressure on her must be so nervwreaking
if someone didn't tell u already u worth it,ily even if u don't know me and i genuinely appreciate u and u are doing amazing.every little thing will be alright so keep going and remember that It is scientifically proved that if u are really bad right now u will be good maybe soon too i m here for u i know what u are going trough but pls ilysm feel free to talk to me,i am not telling u to underestimate ur things,go to a doctor or stuff is not something that is bad or like... U ARE BEAUTIFUL AND I WANNA SCREAM AT THE WORLD THIS BC IT'S WORTH IT AND U ARE WORTH IT AT LEAST FOR THIS STRANGER THAT LITERALLY LOVES YOU SO MUCH,when you want to die you have to strive to live as much as you you want to to die,trust GOD.GOD Bless us.Amen
What a great conversation about this very important topic🤗.
It’s soo cool to watch Dr Ramini grow her career and educate!
honestly i dont know kendall as much but her being this really famous celebrity it must be really hard to control your anxiety especially being in the constant view everyday
😢😭
Watching this video and realizing how I'm not alone in literally worrying that I'm dying constantly.
Scorpio vibes
I hope they shoot such episode with Deepika..she really is that evoked regards this issue
Someone send this to the girl that said "looking like Kendall Jenner would solve my problems"
i better not see ANYONE invalidating her.
Love you Kenny ❤️
i'm sorry but it's so hypocritical for her to say that she's nervous about easing back into socializing after the pandemic when she had a huge birthday party during lockdown
Just talking about this and bringing it to surface is good
Great job...one suggestion, no need to respond to everything said...like " mhhmm,yeah,ok etc...
Dr ramani ❤❤❤💕💕💕
for someone who have social anxiety, I feel really comforted to see people opening about this, and there’s people out there who have the same thing as me  This made me happy Props to her being so honest, and understandable
Omg I am so excited for Dr. Ramani. She is one of the best in the area of narcissism and i’ve been following her for a few years now. To see her at Vogue and getting a bigger audience is sooooo nice. I am so proud of her!
I love to see more kendall hosting like this
Kenny is so gorgeous
Como lo traduzco al español
My anxiety is getting worse during pandemic
I suffer with terrible anxiety. This is such a great conversation, thank you <3
Kendall  be like mmmmmmmm right right
I wish I had friends
This is a crossover i didn’t know we needed
the amount of times Kendall said, "right" lolll no hate tho
remember NOBODY’S life is Perfect! we all struggle with different things! we’re all human beings at the end of the day✨
She's the only Kardashian/Jenner that keeps it real  love her <3
❤ i have seen the doctor's videos before this interview long time ago and they are precise , i am glad she was recognised and no commercial doctor was called in her place.
QUISIERA QUE ESTUVIERA EN ESPAÑOL
I have always noticed that Kendall is a really reserved person!
Yesss Kendal
Queen
right
This is so incredibly accurate
I've had anxiety for over 20 years. And people who never experienced real anxiety, does not understand how it feels. I almost died. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. It comes and goes for no apparent reason and sometimes we feel like breaking down and crying. I pray for all to get over this horrible thing.  Created a FB group: Intimate Group for Anxiety Sufferers.  For those interested. ❤❤❤
My anxiety is so bad I haven’t left my house in months 😕 Even going downstairs to my living room is giving me anxiety sometimes, the last time I went outside was to go take a 20 minutes walk, a few people walked past me and I felt so judged for no reason   I wish people would stop treating it like it’s a choice or I’m making it a bigger deal that it actually is, if I had the choice this wouldn’t be my life, trust me.
idk how anyone watches this when she says right so many times 😭
Bruh as if we never knew lol we all got anxiety and we all dealt and cope w it end of story
Love her it's such an important topic to talk about
kendall looks so much like kim here what is happening
Are there any human left on earth without any level of anxiety by 2021? A small dose of anxiety started to feel natural in my daily routine.
Be kind to ppl you never know exactly what they’re going through no matter how close you are to them💕
the fact that i started crying when she talked about what it feels when you have social anxiety awards me of my mental health. i have social anxiety to a more important degree than i thought … it sucks
Good job VOGUE. Great initiative ❤️
😢😢 its amazing too see this video and know that you are not alone
Glad we are talking about this topic!!!
she has anxiety because her whole family is a bunch of narcissists 😅😅
i totally understand the part where they talk about going out to the world way too fast after being isolated for months. i got a news that i had to go to school to take a test and i got pretty bad anxiety because of that. i wasn’t prepared and now i suddenly have to go out and meet people ? i felt like my chest is tight and it was very hard to breathe. on top of that, i ended up getting stomach pain because of that. i was so anxious that i got sick. i ended up not going and had to reschedule the test for another day. i got so upset and confused as to why am i like this ? why can’t i do normal stuff that people literally do ? i have always been an introvert and anxious person but it has gotten a lot worse after being isolated. i suddenly had this chance to just be with myself without talking to anyone or meet anyone. i got so comfortable with the space i had that i forgot what’s it’s like to have normal life. my anxiety started started to go pretty bad after that. i got stucked in this space. i don’t want to be dramatic so i keep convincing myself that it’s fine. there are people that went through worse. however, it took a wrong turn and i started to think everyone feels this way. but deep in my heart, i knew this is not normal and NOT EVERYONE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS. i wanted to seek professional help but there are just a lot of things came up so i watch these types of video to find out how to cope with this and understand other people with the same condition. i am not self-diagnosing myself. i still don’t know if i have one but if i need to like talk about it, i’ll use the word “anxiety”. i hope that’s not offensive to those that are professionally-diagnosed.
It’s so empowering to see you talk about your journey... anxiety  is hard to deal with.please know that there are people that love and adore you ❤️. Proud of you babe 💜 we need to address anxiety as an real issue and not be vague, so let’s be kind to everyone...
Mental health is not a poor or  rich. So please be kind people I don’t know how this person feel none of us know how she feels we can just be sympathetic and kind.
This Doctor is really good
Thank u so much Kenny
I wanted to cry every second of this video, god if feels so good to know I’m not alone and that I’m not going crazy
Omg she is so beautiful
ohhh booohooo a model ...coz of her family suffers anxeity
❤️
It helps to have friends or family who understand it and/or struggle with anxiety themselves.
i don’t think kendall knows how much she’s appreciated for being vulnerable and opening up about something a lot of people didn’t know was normal. this video was so helpful in so many ways. thank youuu 🙏🏽
Rich people with problems again
I find is amazing that she talk really open about, I think is gone help lots of People out there. And find also really good that a therapist is there❤👍🏼
3:55 I’m sorry what? this girl had a whole Halloween themed bday party in LA unmasked with a BUNCH OF PEOPLE
She's so hypocrital
People act insensitive just because they are celebs🙄
this conversation is much worth! thank you!
She's incredibly beautiful.
Dr. Ramani is the best, love her! go subscribe to her
I wish I could tell my mom this is how I felt. she would never understand, she’s never understood how I felt when I tell her things like this. She things it fake or I have “nothing” to have anxiety about since I’m 13
ugh why kendal. how about interview a celebrity whos actually had to survive with real issues and real anxiety. very good topic but not the right person. period
Omg I needed to hear this. I am not the only one 😭🥺
thanks for bringing up such an important topic!!!
When did she share her story?
Dr. Ramani—where have you been all of my life? Thank you Vogue!
kendalls vocab : "like" "right"
I feel so alone with my anxiety, like it feels like i’am the only one in the world who feels like this. But this video helps, so many people deal with anxiety
dr ramani issuch a  gorgeous intelligent woman❤
Wow! Kendall is such a beautiful person. It's not simple to talk about these things. I'm really surprised. All my support for Kendall and everyone who has problems with anxiety.
she said "like" 40 times in a 11 min video and she didnt even talk much shows how bad her vocab is
Yall had to put in harry
riiight
I'm so glad that a point was raised which bothers me. People saying they feel anxious but are able to continue with whatever task it is they're doing. This isn't anxiety, as such, it's just nerves. Having an anxiety disorder is so much worse. It literally leaves you house bound, it can totally destroy your life, it's not just a feeling of being a bit nervous!
Wow!! Literally every point they made was  helpful and relatble !💖💖
*"like" count: 40*
This intro gave me anxiety at first
People tend to forget that she’s a human being too.
I just want to say thank you for sharing this, I've always had anxiety but also developed social anxiety during the lockdown and it's been tough, I almost don't recognize myself.  Seeing someone put my thoughts into words made me feel less alone and not as crazy lmao I know I'm not crazy but the people that surround me don't struggle with this at all and I feel like I must be the only one then.
She looks like her younger self here
She’s not alone! The shortness of breath and feeling like you need to go to the hospital is something I can relate to! Trying to get control of that physical symptom.
They literally showed Harry and Kendall lol
That thing up there is not always happy !! I felt that and got goosebumps 🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Dealin with it for 9 months.So exhausted.Not being able to enjoy life,having doubts about everything,panic attack,ear tension,jaw pain i mean everything is so hard.Just want to say please we cant let this put us down.We can do it dont give up ❤️
She was just 10 years old when the whole world started judging her and that must have major impact on her anxiety and should give major credit to Kendall as she has maintained a steady mind and not let every hate comment or others opinion get to her !! Really Respect and Proud about her ❤️❤️❤️
You are not alone Kendall and you are so strong for opening up in front of millions of people. we love you
Kendall explaining her anxiety made me realize how deep my anxiety is.
This was good! Real good! Perfect time for me to hear this
meu deus, eu sou a kendall jenner
So relatable, anxiety is a constant struggle.
Kinda funny how she’s talking about being a hypochondriac with Covid and has anxiety during large gatherings but had a full blown party for her birthday and went to her sisters’ parties etc...
As a person who went through social anxiety, i know how this feels. Let's normalize talking and open up about these stuff.
I paused this video so many times because I almost cried about finally feeling like I have an answer to all of my questions!
This was surprisingly useful. As a person who has already experienced a lot of the symptoms brought on by Kendall (including hypochondria!) I also felt more comfortable in facing these sensations through therapy. I wish strength to those who are struggling in these difficult times and that others, through this video, find their way to mental health.
I relate to all that's been said on so many levels
nice
I just love that Dr. Ramani is on this video. Wow.
she is so mature. absolutely amazing hearing her speak
I’m glad she’s sharing her experience.  So important.  Thanks Kendall
It's interesting that the great Dr. Ramani, the narcissists kryptonite, is interviewing Kendall who's mental health could be very influenced by her mother who seems highly controlling and having narcissistic traits. But either way it's awesome Kendall's opening up and is human, just like us.
Hate her or love her, buy she has thid magnetic pull towards her,
I love this video, thank you so much🧠
This was really helpful
im so glad shes not getting hate for this video compared to when she talked about her acne
This was so helpful. Understanding anxiety and knowing we are not alone is so important. Thank you
Love you Dr. Ramani 😍😍
Praying for you to overcome this anxiety in Jesus name!
I mean  she have 140+ million follower each a diffrent opinion of how you look, do, wear, etc. She’s constantly being criticized of what she says or does, we have to understand that not only Kendall but every other celebrity at the end of the day is human. They have good and bad days and we need to be understanding of that.
people need to stop like using the terms of anxiety very loosely. or even generalizing it on their normal day. like, the actual real anxiety does not roll that way. i'm kinda glad kendall shares this with us. mental health awareness is something that we all really need.   i have anxiety. doing presentation in a whole class feels like i'm falling deep in the dark ocean, no oxygen, wailing to be saved. standing in front of the crowds get me very very aching in the stomach, to the point of constipation. so yeah, not a fan of jenners name but i'm really proud of kendall as kendall. as human.
i hate how people try to invalidate celebrities mental health, like they’re life is out there for anyone & everyone to judge you’re jus bound to feel overwhelmed
Thank you for sharing.
💛
So cool that her social anxiety allowed her to throw a huge birthday party at the height of covid :')
I don't like Kendall
Okayyyyy but Harry at 1:10
Kendall maybe an empath. Most people who have anxiety are probably highly sensitive beings or empaths
Did her anxiety make her exploit Mexican workers in México to create her “tequila” which she can’t even pronounce disrespecting an entire culture???
I like how she talks about it to make other people feel better about there anxiety
“The sweet spot of anxiety”, I love that. I hope that everyone who needed to hear this today heard the message as I did! 💓
YouTube a little to comfy with these double no skip ads... I got an ad the other day that was 60 min long and watched 30 of it thinking it was the video I was watching 🤦‍♂️
I have to practice what I'm about to say at least 3 times in my mind and even then I cannot say it with confidence many times.
Omg Kendall you are so stunning
It really is difficult to put your life infront of people always and everytime we all need space we all have anger pain emotions stress no matter how rich poor beautiful or ugly we are we should stop criticizing people and spread as much love as possible.Lots of love for Kendall and other going through mental stress.
Kendall is so strong.. i love she♡
Mental health, physical health, anxiety and everything in between is real. Please be kind with each other, don't bully anyone and talk about your problems openly.  Remember : you are not alone ♥
Thank both of you!❤️
“Rightttt”
Love you
Kendall is so pretty
Love you Kenny!
is this why she's rude...
Such an important conversation 💙 We are so honored that MedCircle and Dr. Ramani got to be a part of this
Thank you Kendall for having the courage to share your story! It was an honor to have this important conversation with you. I hope the tips we shared help others who may be struggling with anxiety too.
I'm only at 4 minutes of the video, but Kendall already described my past 6 months... i'm so so so thankful for this video Vogue!!
Kendall and her "right" is irritating tf out of me.  Coudnt watch this.
wow I love that the topic of anxiety is being discussed in a mainstream way such as vogue wish it was a little longer but what a great step in the direction and de stigmatizing mental health especially during this time when a lot of us are dealing with anxiety and to see you are not a lone in this.
When your anxiety is so bad it gives you a stomach ulcer... You don't suffer alone Kenny. Others go through it too, thank God for animals!
people use anxiety word so normal and am like you don't know what it feels like😑
Anxiety is not an excuse to be a really mean/bad person
Love you kendall
I love Dr. Ramani! I have a signed copy of one of her books. She’s amazing :)
Those "Yes, right, mmm , yeah, right " made me anxious 😁
1:11👀
anxieties...
Everybody has anxiety
My anxiety is so intense atm, I feel  out of breath and uncomfortable
ewwww
Is it just me or does she actually look like kourtney is this video?
I was diagnosed with anxiety at an early age. Thank you kendall for opening up about this. Feels like I'm not alone.
She is so beautiful inside and out. I hope she overcomes her anxiety.
Thank you for this
I'm watching for Dr Ramani lol
I luv you Kenny ❤️
Dr .Ramani love u....subscribed your channel 😍😁😁😁👍
The way she partied all throughout the pandemic and is now talking about “Slowly hanging out with more people” is rubbing me the wrong way
Wow...I've never related to anything more, I needed this. Thanks to Kendall for opening up about this, love her!
So insightful ❤️
Why did i feel like she was speaking to me like  wowww i felt every single word!
I love her 🥺🖤
She’s a multi-millionaire. People have anxiety about feeding their families. Please get a grip and get this vapid person off the screen and influencing children
In this pandemic, I thought I couldn’t get  through my anxiety/panic attacks. I lost my mind for 6 mouths because of the fear and also negative thoughts. After that, I started to practice yoga and my medicine helped me a lot. So if you dealing with this right now, you are not alone and it takes time to understand this but everything will start to make sense for you. you will learn how to deal better with anxiety.
also cut off caffeine
literally had a panic attack 20 minutes before watching this, thank you this really calmed me down & made me realise I'm not going insane.
Really enjoyed this and it’s a hugely important topics ! However, why does the editing feel so odd 😂
I cannot stand her but I appreciate and respect her strength to share this. It must be very helpful to others suffering
Dr Rahmani and Kendall Jenner in one video,talking about social anxiety and giving advices on Vogue? Welp im sure nobody expected it but thank you for doing those!!
this video seriously couldn't have come out at a better time >.< I was feeling so anxious for a social event and this seriously helped me feel a little more calm about it.... I'm happy to know i'd do great in the wild with my anxiety but sometimes my brain just analyzes things a lil too much for this day & age lol... LOVE YOU ALL!!! Thanks so much for sharing your story Kendall!
Never thought I’d relate so much to KJ than I did watching this video.
Yes Kendall 🕊💗
This video should be viral. Thank you Kendall
Great video vogue..I am very comfortable now with my anxiety
a QUEEN I WILL FOREVER LOVE AND SUPPORT.
kendall being open helps me and so many other young people so much
Kendall Jenner is very real.
this is beautiful, love kendall
when you like have anxiety to like say you have anxiety
This made me cry in a way of relief. Learning more about anxiety and the in’s and out’s of it has allowed me to feel more comfortable with my own anxieties and the ways I can navigate through them. I appreciate Kendall for being open & honest and Vogue for being an advocate on mental health. I hope that there can be more awareness and inclusivity when it comes to mental health in the industry and as a society. 🤍
I feel like this will be such a helpful series! Thanks Vogue for putting a spotlight on mental struggles.
I’m really starting to like kylie and Kendall because they’re showing a different part of themselves. And I think that’s beautiful.
I have so much more respect for Kendall Jenner after this. Everything she's said is EXACTLY what I've gone through and I've very rarely heard anyone voice this, much less someone with as large a platform as Kendall.
MISS KENNY WE NEEDED THIS
girl... we all know the “I feel this” at 7:28 when talking about anxiety over friends not following covid guidelines was soooo hypocritical. like come on, she literally held a HUGE UNMASKED BIRTHDAY PARTY during the height of the pandemic, AND WENT TO A PRIVATE ISLAND WITH LIKE 50 OTHER PEOPLE WITH NO MASKS OR DISTANCING
I knew I have anxiety, but when Kendal explained that she would sometimes feel likes she’s dying or her heart is failing, I didn’t know that was anxiety and I didn’t know that I had it that bad
I love Dr. Ramani so much please do more videos with her!!
subtitulos a español :( porfa!
important
What a beautiful doctor! ❤️❤️❤️ she really puts you at ease
so proud of her
I really appreciate this conversation but it’s taking me out of it every time Kendall says ‘right’ or something else after everything the DR says.
I’ve had social anxiety since I was little. I’m 19 now and it has affected me more than ever. People always saying “oh you’re so quiet you should talk more” or  “why don’t you talk more” making it a choke saying “you talk a lot hahah”. People don’t realize that words can sometimes hurt. Please if ur reading this don’t ever say that to anyone you see who suffers with anxiety or who is quiet. Im glad Kendall shared her story! ❤️
Finally a good way she and her team approached this topic.
*This is amazing! Thanks for sharing, there's a lot of people going through different types of anxiety (including myself). CANT FOR FOR PART 2!!*
This is so amazing, thanks kenny for open up with us
THANK YOU
I love this
I absolutely love this! I have bad anxiety as well but I haven’t been able to talk freely about it with anyone or go to a therapist. But this really helped to know that I’m not alone. It literally felt like they were talking about everything I felt. Thank you so much!
Whats with youtube and these no skip ads🤨
As someone who is prone to anxiety, I always like to know a lot of details about what the event is similar to the tip she shared at the end. If I know the time, place, who will be there, etc it always helps make me less anxious :)
Omg my fav kardashian
I really loved this psychologist, I’ve been in and out of therapy and why didn’t any of my psychologists talks to me like this
I'm so happy kendall is opening up. Her ig is always filled with her lush life but I never knew that she had a panic/anxiety disorder let alone have the same thoughts and symptoms as I do. Thank you.
Being a nerd can fix it. Be a supermodel nerd! Get a hoodie and a pair of jeggings. Fashionable, comfort clothes. Bribe your anxiety? Walk in pairs by the pinky? Always safer in pairs! Buy an SOS ring that you can activate when stress gets annoying. It'll call your next of kin.
Dr. Ramani has such a soothing voice
Thank you for this, Vogue ❤
Nobody; Kendall; RIGHT
Love this so much! Thank u
I'm sorry... did she not host a giant birthday party back in November that made even staff uncomfortable??? But now being around more people than "she's used to" makes her nervous....
This was a good Doctor to start off with, she is very well versed in this field.
i cried watching this whole thing because she explained me
woahhhh, this was way too relatable
I was having a rough start to my day, but this video definitely boosted my mood. Thank you, Vogue! We need more videos like this during these trying times.
Love the direction you are going in Vogue!
me after this interview: RIGHT
She looks so much like Kim here.
can we please have ariana grande talk about her anxiety? im fine with kendall but she has countless videos with vogue. ariana has 1. i think its nice kendall is talking about this but vogue, please have ariana on this series too
This was boring. Im going back to watching girls next door
So amazing that she is doing this :)
Proud of her for opening up about it, helps de-stigmatizing talking about mental health is so important.
I feel you Kenny ! I've been struggling with anxiety for a few years now .. Is there someone else with anxiety to talk with ?
"Destigmatize mental health issues," this is what a public platform can do. Thank you Kendall for unselfishly telling your story and for letting us know that it is okay to admit that one needs help and to seek it before it's too late. Your beauty, poise and intelligence is admirable. ❤
i appreciate kendall for opening up about this
tysm for this vogue and absolutely for you kendall cuz speak up about this.This is really need to concerns mores
01:10 did I see Mr. Styles? Or am I hallucinating?
One thing I commonly see about her online is that she’s rude to strangers however I understand why she may come off that way now because of her anxiety. As a person that deals with social anxiety myself I have had people tell me that I have come off as cold or uninviting because of how scared I am to be perceived
i know!! ... How that feel because i struggle with the samething!. I lo❤ve what ur doing talking about it. One of my rolemodel in life was "Andy irons" an he struggle with the samething. 😇
kinda scary to see that no matter how perfect your life is, no matters how successful or beautiful you are, anxiety can still reach you.
hi i love you
I'm early lol
She almost teared up at the end and I almost teared up 🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
bruh that opening montage made me anxious
Beautiful Kenny!
Yayyyy doctor Ramani ❤️❤️
I dont care about her plastic surgeries shes absolutely gorgeous
Never thought I would get such good tips! Thank you
As someone who has lived their entire life with severe anxiety and has had to survive off disability because of it.  .....this is an absolute joke and not even TOUCHING this topic. 🙄 This is also kind of dangerous because people can have physical issues that are NOT anxiety. One of the BIGGEST things that is a problem in the healthcare AND mental health system is doctors dismissing actual health issues for anxiety. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Meanwhile Asian people are getting assaulted in broad daylight all over America and Europe, but sure, let's discuss Kendall Jenner's anxiety
This video made my day I never comment and all but this was nice
I got diagnosed with GAD and clinical depression 2 weeks before the pandemic started last year, it was so difficult to remain in contact with my psychiatrist and had to remain on antidepressants for 8 months without constant CBT. It was horrible. My heart goes out to those suffering with mental illnesses. You'll have better days.
I have always noticed she's had it since she was younger.  Glad she opened up about it❤️
This was soooo interesting to watch I loved it 👏🏼👏🏼
wait didn’t she throw a party during the pandemic??
Kendall face has a great  similarities to her sister Kim Kardashian !!
i think i have social anxiety
¡Gra ¡Cias! M
One of the best thing ❤️
I love that therapist. She is amazing.
who asked for this?
After a point all the Jenners and Kardashians start looking the same
absolutely incredible interview....helped me feel so much less lonely in the dark world of anxiety and panic attacks
i love kendall´s brave and positivity so much!!
I can feel you ✨
Oh no...Kendall Jenner is anxious...stop the world
Im so distracted by her lips...
She looks like Emrata
OMG DOC RAMAANII HEEEREEEEE Love her
This really helped me thank you for sharing🙏🏻
Awesome segment
its actually so sad, majority of people always seeing celebrities  as "mean and stupid" and they usually think like oh what are you talking about you have money etc etc but no wtf they are humans too like what do you mean? they have problems too
As someone who deals with anxiety and depression I’m glad that she’s using her platform to talk about this! I know it’s hard but even one person sharing their story can make a world of difference
This is the exact same anxiety I get it’s the worst 🥺
I hope she is able to overcome her anxiety and learn to control it and not let it get the best of her x
Since this covid has started I became timid anxious even though I was a easy going person
Her new lips give me anxiety
These are rich people's problems.
Truly a beautiful video that helped me a ton as I figure out my anxiety journey ❤️
Everyone reading this if you suffer through depression or anxiety i hope that you get better soon but please don't forget that you are loved! And so are you kendal
Dr. Ramani <3
we!! dont!!! care!!!
I haven't started the video yet, but having anxiety, this 0:27 did not really help.
This is sooo AMAZING!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
kendall is a scorpio and now she is talking about something deep and private for all of us! thanks kenny for talk about mental health
1:37 - 2:04 wise words, eh?
As a counsellor I'm so glad to see videos like this where mental health is put on a platform in a positive and supportive light! Yes to breaking the stigma and shame around these topics; a lot of people go through things like this so knowing you are not alone is a great message and knowing you can reach out to a professional or your nearest and dearest is also a wonderful idea.
this was surprisingly helpful! keep it up vogue :)
whether you have anxiety or not, it’s important to learn about it. it’s super important to know how to healthily cope and help people do so. it’s important to be aware of your feelings and those around you!
#RealConvo #MentalHealthMatters
she's soooooo sweet I love her
Ahhh harry!
God has a plan for me to be a successful artist one day 💯🤍🔜🙏🏽
how can someone dislike this??? she is so honest love this video thank you vogue 🙏🏽
Subtítulos por favor😭
I'm anxious about EVERYTHING
Kendall is so honest.... so loyal 💖
Anxiety is something that im dealing with since i was a kid. especially to be raised in an environment where everyone is so judgy when it comes to your daily choices. so watching someone who raised in a much more difficult situation that I've been through is totally making me more comfortable bcs realizing that every human being are dealing with anxiety no matter what status of your life is.
drink a Pepsi Kendal, it’ll fix all your problems 🤡🤡

This could not have come at a better time
Anxiety being a magnifying glass to only negative things is so true.
She is really holding not to cry I think.. Her eyes.. I hope she is okay. Those eyes say something but nothing at same time
I really appreciate her talking so openly about it with a lot of people, I wish her all the best!
They say I look like her, but I’m not really sure 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Kendal wanna trade places
kendall and i are both libra mercuries and i’ve noticed that most (if not all) libra mercuries i have met have social anxiety. it’s because we care a lot about others perspectives of us and have trouble communicating in fear of judgment :,)
Kendall looks so professional tho
OMGG I clicked and was so happy to see Doctor Ramani!!! She’s the best
Her eyes says everything. Blank but saying something. Sad but happy, such a beautiful and expressive eyes.
I honestly feel like a lot of the time when people have had bad experiences with Kendall it’s due to her anxiety. I feel bad for her
It's difficult to be honest and true about your vulnerabilities at such a platform. Kudos Kendall ❤️
1:10  I'm a simple girl I see Harry styles I pause
Does this video provide closed captions?
Taking a shot everytime Kendall says- right Jk!
..........😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕😕
THANK YOU FOR THIS CONVERSATION it’s so incredible important thank you dr Ramani Kendall and Vogue🪴🥰❤️
It sucks bc I am so aware if my surround + self aware that my anxiety is so bad!
Hmmmmm
❤️ you Kenny
That was an awesome video, I have anxiety and it does feel like your having a heart attack, it's an awful feeling, 😞 God Bless Kendall for let's her fans know they are not alone!!
Is Kendall pregnant?
This is so relatable
I’m so happy to get to watch this video, I’ve been contemplating talking about my experience with anxiety and depression and now I kinda have summoned courage
It’s a lot of pressure to be so famous at such a young age. She’s human like the rest of us my heart goes out to her. Always liked her the most.
yeah
She’s a Scorpio, her anxiety just makes sense.
Billie eilish:IM THE BAD GUY  youtube:IM THE AD GUY 🙄
Having anxiety attack is not a joke. There’s a lot of things running in my mind and I sometimes wanted to commit suicide.
Oh please o
Dr Ramani is AMAZING.
Dr Ramani! What an icon.
Thank you for making this videos Vogue no matter who is there talking its important that someone talks about it.
This is probably why a lot of people say she is super cold when they meet her or wait staff says the same. She probably has severe social anxiety that is debilitating. Makes a lot of sense now.
Wow! Such a comfort it brings to us! A relief to talk about that and listen as well. Thank you Kendall for sharing this, it's such a courage and hope you'll feel good! 🥰⚘
Dr. Ramani is amazing. I’m so glad you had her on for this.
Sooo Proud of you Kenny ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love Dr Ramani! I follow her on her YT channel
I hope she is able to overcome her anxiety its hard to deal with it celebrity or not.
BEYONCE!!!!
I love that she's open about this type of stuff
YALL SAY HARRY AND KENDALL IN A CAR IN THIS VID?
Honestly never believed in zodiacs   But , She’s a scorpion 🦂  I’m one too  And I can feel and understand every bit of a word she’s saying  Yes its true we are nervous being open about what we are struggling with  We don’t open up until it’s a right person
I love how openly she talks about problem like this one, young girls and boys of course
11 minutes and 11k views
love my baby
First
I feel the same way, thank you for sharing this♥️🙏🏻
This is such a beautiful video honestly. It feels so nice hearing someone else's side of the story. Thank You!
Please put "Like" out of your vocabulary.  It makes you sound uneducated. Just like someone who says "ok" every few words.
Thank you for being vulnerable.
She is a Scorpio, I'm a Scorpio I believe I understand her
This is typical stuff byee
I also have social anxiety and had depression.. I can understand her especially when you are in entertainment field especially being a model it's difficult
DOCTOR RAMANI YOU’RE DOING AMAZING SWEETIE
When your anxiety is so bad you start running out of breath.
“Mhm, right, yeah, right, ok, ok cool”
wow your lips got bigger lately
To people reading this, anxiety is real. Please be kind to the people who go through such stuff on daily basis. TPWK
This is Soo beautiful thankyou Kendall for opening up ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I don’t care what anyone says; no amount of money or fame can make battling anxiety/depression/mental illness any easier and celebrities shouldn’t be made to feel otherwise.
I loved listening to Dr. Ramani talk regarding anxiety, especially with relating to the pandemic in the sense of how going out again is not going to be something easy especially for those of us who deal with anxiety, as now we have been used to being inside and going out into the world again to deal with all that's out there is going to be extremely overwhelming. I loved her input regarding taking it a step at a time when things are opening up again.
She kool
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY TO VOGUE AND WITH MY FAVORITE SUPERMODEL 🤩
Honestly Kendall doesn't deserve this hate i feel y'all forget that the Kardashians are humans too
so proud of her for opening up about her own mind to help other people
Yes she is a beautiful runway model but she is also a beautiful role model to all her followers ❤️
This is so relatable 😭❤️
Props to her opening up about this. Its hard for someone like her who is labeled as “perfect” to come out about something like this because thousands  of people will always say its for attention
y’all see harry in the beginning
I wish her all the very best! <3 Anxiety is tough
I’m early!
Can we just appreciate the fact she sharing this with us like she’s so strong 🥺💕
I love you Kendall I pray you are always safe and happy more power to you girl
As a person with Anxiety I love how she’s always talking about this and I always feel like I’m the only person with Anxiety but I’m not I’ve had Anxiety since I was 5 Thanks for the likes
Lovely babe is back oh my gosh my sexo babe love you to much and i hear something about your relationship with cristiano its really super😘
ILY KENDALL
BRAVE = FIGHTING FOR OTHERS
Thankyou Vogue. ♥️
Indians are always best🇮🇳
i’ve always had these symptoms like a raising heart when just walking or when i’m with people or a short breath as if i need to learn how to breathe. Only last year i found out about my anxiety. Just remember that no one’s judging you, at the end of the day you only have yourself so might as well get comfortable with yourself :).
I love kendall❤😍😍
that’s a lie though 😭 when i tell people i’m socially anxious they say “just chill”
I can relate to her sm
Thank you so much for this vídeo❤
1:11 kendall and harry omg
EVERY HUMAN EXPERIENCES ANXIETY AND EVERY HUMAN EITHER LEARNS TO MANAGE IT OR NOT. FIGHT OR FLIGHT WE NEED IT IT IS OUR WARNING SYSTEM. GET OVER YOURSELF YOU ARE SO PRIVILEGED TALKING ABOUT IT ONLY HELPS YOU GO DO SOMETHING USEFUL IF YOU REALLY CARE AND I DONT MEAN A HARRY AND HIS WIFE PHOTO SHOOT
so proud of her for filming this. she is a person and I think people forget!
Ahh, Dr. Ramani !!!!!!! Love her
kendall's gorgeous
We should be happy for her, dont be so negative guys.its honestly heartbreaking how jealous people can be
Anxiety is really the worst like you'll always be in a fight/flight mode smh.
I get exactly what she means about the stigma around anxiety. Whenever i use the term 'anxious' or 'anxiety' to describe a situation it feels almost wrong in a way bc i dont want others to think im dramatic or attention seeking. Even speaking about with my parents usually gets a passive response or make me feel invalid which is why i think over time people are scared to come forward and explain their feelings. Its such an important topic as so many people experience it and get shut down or invalidated when talking about it

It’s so nice to see someone who lots of people wish they could be just open up and be relatable and honest.
Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy and financially blessed Amen...
Kendall Jenner...
I’ve had an anxiety disorder called Selective mutism since I was 3 years old and went to kindergarten
She is so beautiful
White girl problem. Periodt
What does that clip of her with harry in the car have to do in a video about her anxiety guys 😑
i love you, ken. thank you. 🤍
Go Kendall
My favourite Jenner ❤️
Wow soo proud of her for actually opening up 😘
I love her so much she’s amazing 💝
Hi early birds
Any Indians here?
Ariana Grande should be here to.
😱
ohh
Stream on the ground and gone
Love
Congrats to whoever found this comment😋
She is honest ❤️
I feel like people shouldn't just hate on her because she's part of the KarJenner clan, they need to watch videos like this one 🤍🤍🤍
I love Dr. Ramani's ted talks!
YouTube getting real comfortable with these no skip adds
Wow. This is deep
Do a video with harry styles and Niall Horan and louis Tomlinson and zayn malik and liam payne
she’s so gorgeous !!!
I admire her honesty! It’s a big thing opening up about your personal struggles on the internet and I think she does it great! She’s honest and she is intimate which is the perfect way to talk about it❤️
1:10 isn't that harry styles
I think this video could be very interesting and can help a lot of people cause you know a lot of young people (especially) think that models, actors, celebrities are perfect but no they are humans too
Can we have Gigi hadid doing this plz?!
I can’t understand the hype she is a regular looking woman. Have you seen others? She is not even that pretty
Gigi hadid > kendall jenner
