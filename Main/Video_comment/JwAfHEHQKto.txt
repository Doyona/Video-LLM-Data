Subscribe for the full Camera and Battery test coming v soon! 🔥 To see why I flipped from iPhone to the Samsung Z Flip and what happened: https://youtu.be/KLWdtl5S51g
Watching this on my 15 pro ❤
I am from noakhali, Bangladesh  Can you give me a iPhone.😢 Any model 🎉 I am not your relatives but a subscribe obviously 😔 7:20
for any review this is my guy
I think Arun and Mr Mobile reviews are more comprehensive and enjoyable than the others. MKBHD is a close 3rd.
I love this iPhone 15 Pro Max. I just wish I didn’t upgrade it to iOS26. Now the battery life is bad thanks to battery hungry features of iOS26
Wait the s24 utra was not outta yettt😂
@10:00 HIEF is a efficient format i agree. However, the broader support in terms of compatibility of the JPEG needed your mention which was completely missed out.
I finally got mine today
5:01 using milo as a phone stand is wild🤣
time to save up for a refurbished 15 pro max
2:31 you predicted the camera capture button 1 year before iPhone 16 Pro!!😂😂
Why YouTube is recommending this in 2025?
So which one should i buy
i cant believe apple watched this video and decided to add a shutter button to the new phones lol, Mrwhosethboss you have a superpower, YOUR OPINION lmaoooo
8:04 I had the iPhone 11 before, and then I upgraded to the iPhone 14, and I think the iPhone 14 is more comfortable to hold
7:50 what’s with the Ayo chill🤨
Watching on the 14 pro rn and I am mad jealous
What you said about the action button became a feature for iPhone 16
IPhone addiction is real. People are overhyping this All way to much. They cant even process how they are being mindless Zombie like customers.
Can you give me one of those please?
2:35 he predicted the camera control button lol
Triple tap power is best use mine for screen speak
Hello champ please can I get the iPhone to make contents as a preacher 🤲🏿
I'm Completely sold on the voice isolation thing
Watching this on my 15 pro max blue titanium
i hate 15 pro max
Best review of this iPhone I’ve seen!
I think 15 pro max better all models apple because i am using 15 pro max
All i learned from this video, is that spec sheets aren't everything.  I've always thought that the 15 pro was practically just the 14 pro with an action button, and USB-C, but this changed my mind indefinitely. Im starting to question whether I should actually get a 14 pro now, or get the 15 pro for the minor differences that I never knew existed.
Nah bro ur just a iPhone hater and the 15 pro max is a rlly great phone 👌
Thank you for all helpful informations  And I want To ask you about your wallpaper from where you got it
The way bro predicted that camera button 💀
You predicted camera control thats crazyyyyy🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
rewatching it, reloving my 15 pro max. ❤️
At 18:27 he says that the pro is 999 and the pro Max is a hundred dollars more but it's actually 200. Here's how:- If we round up 999 we get 1000$ and if we round up 1199 we get 1200$. So, it's 200$ more
Fancy words
Please where can i get that wallpaper
6:27 out of context
2:32 bro just predicted the iphone 16 or apple took bro idea lmaoo
Watching this on the 15 pro, amazing quality and I’ve cooked up some serious videos and funny/satire videos on my channel.
Cool review but you didn’t mention the reason I just upgraded to the 15 Pro. Apple Log.
bro predicted the iphone 16
So do I buy a 15 pro max or 15 plus?
2:31 bro predicted camera control 💀
Wallpaper?
excellent review. i am getting iphone 15 pro tomorrow. i dont need the 5x zoom or better battery.
Why can't they just admit how much those phones suck??
But:🎵🎵🎵🎵🎶🎶
The cat was a paid actor!
send me one for free 😄
I still use a iPhone 5 so i will Upgrade
I upgraded from 11 to 15 pro. Best ever
WTH is the “back tap” feature?✨👀✨
iPhone 15promax. after 6months usage I wish I stayed with android. Other than face id security this phone was clearly not tested for functionality and layout
It's so funny watching this after the release of the Iphone 16 with you using the action button for camera and the 16 has the camera control button
6:50 that flip was insane
You're missing out if your'e playing a AAA game on a phone. 😢
8:49  are you in Indy? Mass ave in Indianapolis have those light signs
foreshadowing the capture button on the 16’s
Oct 31; Should I buy the iPhone 15 pro max, 8/256GB for gaming and recording or streaming on TikTok (when not recording) or the IPad Pro 6th gen, 16GB, 2TB?  Other notes; I play call of duty mobile daily, I’m very good so I’m now limited by my little s9 (lags a lot) so I’m planing on upgrading this weekend, I’ve saved up, so I’m wondering which to go for.  My potential concerns are 1, I need the iPhone camera and I know it’s capable of playing codm very efficiently but will it be able to hold up for 2- 3 without lagging, unnecessary battery drain and issues? I don’t know if the iPad can holllll uppp either too, that’s why jm asking the world chat, what should I go for?

From ip13 pm to ip15 pm, and yes i choose this not the 16 fresh from the box days old phone. Smooth and fast, what an upgrade.
Bro gave Apple an idea for the camera control
watching this on my 15 pro😀
Fr bros the reason for the new button
Can I get that wallpaper featured on the thumbnail please..?
Something we can do with that power, while destroying ur iPhone’s battery
bro predicted the camera button
he just predicted the iphone 16
i guess we have you to thank for the capture button on the iphone 16 models
im getting this on monday!!!! im soo exitedddd!!!!!!!!!!
Hi idk if i should get the iphone 15 pro or 16 base
Predicted the camera control on the 16s
2:30 apple listened to mrwhosetheboss and added camera control (button) later year in iPhone 16 lineup
Good review - BUT, Tooooooooooooooooooo fast for non geeks........... slow down!
Hi, this is very good review.  Now iphone 16 released and iphone 15 pro will be discontinued. Is it still worth to buy this iphone 15 pro or latest 16 considering minimum updates in latest phone. Thanks
This mans audio quality is truely annoying it feels like sitting in his throat please somehow reduce his audio quality
Thumbnail wallpaper?
good throw and catch mate
He predicted the shutter button
this guy's videos are so entertaining
@mrwhosetheboss 2:31 you gave them the idea to add shutter button
My iPhone sucks. Every time I drop it off the roof of my house it breaks. I’ve gone through 4 this month😢
prediciting the iPhone 16 camera button
If you look at 9:27 then you will notice that motion photo on samsung is on and live photo on iphone is off.  That is why samsung is taking time, because it is capturing the mini video sample too! Otherwise the capturing time would have been same.
Samsung❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤      Nah just kidding. I like iPhone. Thought some random fanboy would be the top comment again for the 1000th time😃.
I just watched your review on the iPhone 16 and I’m back to see this. Thank you I’m staying with my 15 pro max. I don’t need None of what they added on the 16
Use Emulation offline
i cant believe apple watched this video and decided to add a shutter button to the new phones lol, Mrwhosethboss you have a superpower, YOUR OPINION lmaoooo
wallpaper in the thumbnail is very cool
Why on earth do u have gloves on!!
How can you use triple tap?.??
Wow
Iphone 15 plus or iphone 15 pro what should i choose?
all Gimmicks😂😂😂..for a simple person who just wants a phone that works
Can u gift me one iphone 15
16:14 as you say this I get a add for Google pixel 😂
14:53  not Arun looking like an npc 😂😂😂
2:30 no way you predict the next useless bottom from the 16
iPhone 13 series causes display problem white screen issue costumers never damage this phone but how it's causes apple never responsible to iPhone 13 series manufacturing defect i not only so many costumers facing this problem so. You make a video for 13 series this very useful your fans and many apple costumers
Battery is an absolute shit show
Does anyone have that wallpaper from the thumbnail?
Watching because I can't afford 😊
What happened to arun's face at 04:34 - 04:37
The best review 👌👌👌
Just slide the phone down your hand until you reach the button lol
good
You can also get way more console games too on xbox cloud gaming, but you wont be able to play playstation exclusives sadly
I love the iPhone 15 pro. The 15 plus is great - massive battery life  and light in the hand compared to the 15 pro max.  However, the 15 pro is easier to hold. Audio quality is up compared to the iPhone 14 for wired, wireless and speakers. The action button is brilliant. I configured mine to launch a different menu depending on focus mode (if you're not using focus modes and ios workflow shortcuts you really aren't getting the versatility and integrated customisation that is better than my android phones).  Camera and video are excellent on the 15 pro.  And os and security updates that will last 7 years with the phone, (based on past proven experience) lasting that long and still being performant.  For per year value the 15 series is hard to beat.  If you really want the best battery life gp for the 15 pro max or Sony 1vi, both of which lasted a lot longer than my Samsung ultra. The aony is narrower amd easier to hold than the 15 pro max and Samsung Ultra; it has a 3.5mm headphone socket and SD card slot. And the Sony 1vi camera, using raw, with its natural look compared to the sharpening with the Ultra outs the joy back into photography. However, the Sony 1vi only gets 4 years of security updates. But is leagues ahead of the ultra and 15 pro max for wireless audio, including newer Bluetooth and WiFi support.
s23 ultra its best
Got mine today and damn it’s really quick
does the old iphone the back button feature?
where did bro download his wallpaper? I want it!
yes my 11 pro max is more comfortable to hold.
Where did you get the wallpaper in the thumbnail?
Loved the way you used your cat as a stand for the gameplay 😂
tbh i only get the pro bc the the three cameras make them look nicer
Which should I buy? Pro or Pro max?
Sorry to see still no option to block/send to voice mail ONLY (ONLY) calls from (HIDDEN) caller ID .. all Android phones can do that.. whats going on with Apple? Mrwhosetheboss should ask Apple about that.
I can’t decide on my first new iPhone. I currently have iPhone 7.  It’s iPhone 11 , or 15 pro max and I just can’t decide.  I have smaller hands and worried that if I buy the iPhone 15 max pro, it may feel too big while holding with 1 hand.  Any1 have iPhone 11 and iPhone 15?  If so, what feels better in hand? The iPhone 11 would save me lots of money but as it will be my first brand new phone, I’m thinking 15 max pro will be better.
You can shoot 48 mega pixel photos as well but you need to activate it from the settings
Any halfbaked android for the half price does far more and far better tricks than Apple. One mus been really crazy to pay 1500 eur for an incompleted device with mediocre specs and battery laughable charging speeds compared to android phones and lauughable megapixels camera front and back compared to androids. Also laughable refresh rate screens compared to adroid plus many else.
Use your thumb for action button
Should I get the iPhone 15 Pro?
Im watching this on my iphone 15 pro max
When an iPhone 15 Pro review becomes an iPhone 15 pro max review 😅
Honestly i just bought this phone to have a seemless transitions from my old 12 pro. Most of my settings are transferred without a hitch. Ez life.  Too deep in the eco system for a change now.
What’s the difference between the iPhone 15 pro and the iPhone 15 pro max?
S 24 ULTRA !!!
Beba
Does anyone know the name of the Song at 14:19?
15 pro max gang
Sony Xperia is the Best 😈
0:45 why does the box look like theres a copper iphone in it ?
Thank you. Your comments are very good and helpful🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
God bless  the company let them make more tech
Is it Worth it to upgrade from Xiaomi 10t pro to I phone 15 pro max or pro?
Which is the best fast charge (C) cable/charger to get in your opinion please Arun? Thanks
good comment
Bad Comment
odd question but what is the wallpaper on the thumbnail?
Is just another iphone 14!! No upgrade! I feel stupid that i got the 15 pro max! Is just the same phone
damn there's a back tap feature on iphones
Apple should hire you
18:30 not going up a 100, but 200
Watching these with my 15 pro :>
Omg how much i dont like this guy and his channel
16:08 subbed lmao 😂
If I had one I would get a screen protector and shock proof case
About the apus, it may have the same raw performance as the s24 ultra, but the raytracing performance is way better on the 15 pro max
Dont waste water plz
I didnt know about that tap feature
Please give me your old I phone
Please give buy me laptop or I phone 14promax
Old SE, like the small iPhone 5 version 🤣to 15 pro ❤ well needed upgrade absolutely love it
8 months already?? Woah, time sure does fly by.
Well, my 12 mini has the voice isolation mode, so that doesn’t count.
I’d like to download that wallpaper
Like basically no upgrades and still high prices. I won't listen to propaganda that says that this is good.
Google translate:  Nearing the end of mobile phone development, companies are playing the game wisely by making small changes to each new model....Iphone 12pro and 15pro are same,you will say 15 pro has more cpu core, brigthtness bla bla bla SAME SHIT ! 😅
where to download the wallpaper you used ?
Wallpaper is nice…pls share.

i used to not to like iphone, but this time they're doing it right. if iphone is now capable of running RE: village and RE: 4 remake (even if it's not full quality) but still that's a powerful one, none of android can run that. the optimization of OS also amazed me, as a user of android for 12yrs what i noticed is in iphone you don't need to tweak too much, in android you need to tweak much which is hassle.
I thought it was a load of sht , so... A little better would be a load of crap? 😜
the potrait mode that he tell just had on google pixel 3 💀
Thank you for the review! need this review because i want to buy someday a iPhone 15  pro
What colour is your personal iPhone 15 pro max?
the screen feels so bad! it has a drag on fingers
The voice isolation mode seemed dope...great review...
The cat 😍😍💛👌🏾
If only Stadia was still a thing…. I loved it and miss it dearly.
770.00 i just got lucky
10:28 iphone 6s can do that too
It’s sooo good that it looks and dose the same shit as iPhone XS lol
When I see someone that has an iPhone I automatically know they are financially irresponsible and want validation and attention from other people more than their own satisfaction.  For that amount of money, you can buy a whole gaming SETUP (PC, keyboard, mouse, monitor) AND a normal Android phone for normal phone use, or a really high-end gaming PC. IPhone is nothing but the same shit in a different package sold for gold every time they release a "new" one.
I like iPhone 15 pro max.
please gift me this 15 pro 🙃😭😭
In Sri Lanka, buying a phone like this is a dream😅
"naturally sits on it"....... Moves finger to natural place
I want the wallpaper 😀
What wallpaper do you use?
Too over reacting
You can play Xbox games on your android. That's been aropund for a few years now, with Xbox Games pass Ultimate
I switched to iPhone 15 pro max after 7 years of android usage, last phone S22 Ultra (Samsung and OnePlus). iPhone screen quality and touch sensitivity is way below Samsung and moreover iPhone's 120 Hz screen jitters while scrolling in all apps. Jittering is massive in Agoda.
11k dislikes from Samsung the users 💀💀
You couldn’t resist could you? Mega pixel joke 😂
So basically it's a shit device which just got one button added in itself
If Aliexpress had a commercial videos. This is it
Y'all always have these attached to your hand 24/7
Wallpaper???
iPhone X to iPhone 15 pro big ubgrade😜
Ayo chill
The funny thing is there's already dynamic island replications for android and some have even more functionality and aesthetics. One that I tried is highly configurable in position and when no notification is shown, it will shrink back into the tiny hole punch camera. Actually looks pretty cool especially on AMOLED screens.
can you donate me a flagship phone
you know the phone is bland when the biggest effects are voice isolation like this is such a boring flagship like man a 134900 rupee phone should diffrentiate from the last 134900 phone
As a left handed person, the button placement is PERFECT lol
Wish i could force people to use voice isolation lol sick if talking to people while sound like they’re at a waterfall
It's crazy how I went from wanting an iPhone 11 to 13 mini to 13 to 15 plus and I have the 15 pro apple is very good at making you give them money😂
I have been thinking of switching to the I phone 15 for a few days now you always are my go to text youtuber 🫶

Can i get the wallpaper please?
When someone tells me to go touch grass: 4:58
What the worst review
It would have been good if you had told any SOT for this phone.
From where bro got this wallpaper
bad side:EXPENSİVE
What is the wallpaper  ?
Does anyone can provide me thumbnail phone wallaper? 😊
Sony had that button for years lol
Just FYI, you can use the volume buttons as shutter buttons
Anyone else turn their phone the other way when using landscape mode ? I have to turn mine 90 degrees anti clockwise. Action buttons in the wrong place for me as a camera button 😂
What country is this?
You have so may Iphone gift me one
I wonder why isolation mode is not the default! like in the pixel 8 pro and  why in tthe pixel 8 pro by default does not  remove the wind from the video  witch is standard in the iphone! this is clearly marketing from both sides, but anyway, should be default
I want that wallpaper it looks amazing, Any ideas where I can find it
*apple advertising their new titanium material and improving the comfort  meanwhile 98% of people who use cases anyway: ok cool bro 👍
Welcome guy's can't afford but still watching 😮‍💨
They keep change where things are and how we have to operate them, when what one can do with the iPhone and iPad goes backwards.  The main free software Apps., like Pages , is still only does half of what the free App Publisher use to do. Why didn't they upgrade Publisher and drop Pages?Clearly some drongo does not understand graphic design. So many timesI have missed getting "the money shot," because I held the camera button a tad too long. It was so simple to turn on the camera without all of the complications that should be in settings, exist with the camera open or should be in post operation. Technically the speed of iPhone has increased but too often new software increases the number of steps in an operating sequence. Every extra press of a button is a 50% reduction in iPhone speed and efficiency. Too many times the programmers duplicate controls, with no regard to the most efficient flow chart.  I mean hold the camera button on, and the first thing you get is REMOVE APP. That should only be available in settings. Hold down the Phone button, and there is no option to make a phone call!  It should open to keyboard with the option bar below, "favourites, recent, Contacts, Voicemail." Even though we should tap Contacts and not Phone if we want to select a number from contacts.
It's ridiculous that you pay a hundred dollars for 15 pro and it has only 3300 mAh battery.
good video, lose the music
Arun's interesting face is hilarious 😂
Can you please do a video of every iPhone ever made
I have been keen to watch your videos reviewing every new phones of interest. I think you didn’t do just to mention the overheating part of the iPhone 15 pro max. It was important, especially people like me who watch your content as you advice on the performance of the phone
All iphones have voice isolation option since 2 and half years 😒
Can you review your chair? I’m more interested in the chair that you slammed yourself onto it every single time.
These reviews are just 😂 .... They always find something to defend apple .... I wonder how much apple pay them to the promotions ....I guess it's alot because they are not doing shit to stand out with their phones .... So it's just funny as a whole to see all the things unfold every single time with the same exact script 😝
Jumping from iphone XR to 15 Pro, the phone feels surely premium and excellent . BUT, my new phone had a hardware issue and had to drop it in at the service centre and they replaced the parts under warranty. So much for Pro model, Apple did not give me a new phone, but decided to replace the parts. The whole new experience was ruined for me.
Nice wallpaper, where can i get it?
Pls tell us where to get that amazing wallpaper?
I'm watching his videos because I'm trying to figure out what phone to buy
what's that tune in the intro?
Unboxing iphone recently is boring and lacks that experience of personalising your iphone. I like charging my iphone straight from the box. The removal of the sd card, charger and headphones makes the Unboxing unmemorable and unpleasant. Please Apple must bring back these items and keep them challenge pose by Chinese phones on fast charging. I love a phone that charges quickly.  No time to waste. Time is money
You don't tell the anymore. You have also put an ad in the middle of your video once. And you said we can trust you and not OEMs. @mrwhosetheboss
Sir could you please attach the link of your wallpaper ??
Is USA variant 15 pro safe to purchase ?
what is the song called that you use at the end of your videos? By the way, you are my favorite youtuber that I've watched! I like you more than apple!
😮please can i have an iphone
Apple users still buying the same phone when Samsung users onto appliances xD
I have been using a 13 pro max and the voice isolation works as good as you've shown here too. Even on my iPhone XR is works well. It's nothing new.
Nice wallpaper.. From where did you download it?
I am totally unhappy with the brittle nature of the back cover which comes in like 2 cent, breakable glass. Not to mention, once that happens... that is you break it, which will happen eventually as it does with all glass items, the cost of getting one replaced by Apple service is humongous... Apple products are basically a scam. I am a long term iphone 12 pro max user and I am very displeased with these so-called high end, over priced nuisance value... 👎👎👎
Wish I had an iphone😢
What wallpaper you use?
Pixel stores in HEVC... There are so many better analogs on the Android side. The fan boy is showing.
I need that wallpaper
I think the action button would be perfect on the side of the power button and just near the bottom.
Do u think i should switch from samsung s23+ to iphone 15 pro?
Sir your light's on, at around 15:17 minutes of this video 😂😂😂❤
What wallpaper is that ? I like it
A little off topic…sort of. But, if iPhones and such these days can run fairly new, high graphical fidelity games with HDR, at 720p. Nintendo has literally 0 excuse for the ‘Switch 2’ to not run at a minimum of 2k – 60fps in handheld and 4k 120fps docked. There’s genuinely no excuse!  If they don’t – it’s absolutely ridiculous, that I…..  will end up buying one anyway because Nintendo games are amazing, but I’ll be writing an angry letter. I’m on it, don’t worry everyone. The letter will be very angry indeed 😡
Double tapping on a Samsung A50 immediately takes me to the Camera so idk about that action button heh :') Paired with the volume button to take shots. Really want to be convinced of the iPhone outside of just iMessage & Facetime 😢
Just got my iPhone 15 pro max yesterday and watched the boys 🔥 very powerful machinery! 🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️❗️❗️❗️❗️❗️
ur video is 20 min long , its gonna die before i watch it 10 times on this phone
I wonder of one can put GTA v on the 15 pro…
can you give me one please
The iPhone 11 Pro was to this day the easier iPhone ever to handle
One thing about “post processing “ photos I noticed that on my 15 pro, when I go to the gallery and take a look at the photo I notice that before the photo gets in full resolution quality I have to zoom in (pinch in) and back to normal zoom or click to modify, then it gets full resolution , but if I close the photo and reopen it still looks not as much sharp as when I zoom in or click modifiy, am I the only one? 😅
Buy me an iPhone.    Watch Gadgetin
Just ordered my 15 pro max arrives tomorrow can’t wait. Upgrading from a 12. Never had a pro max so hopefully see the difference
Does it support 120hz on all apps?
These portrait mode photo looks too 3D, it's look like you using the photo of somebody else's body and glue your head photo on it. So funny 😂😂😂
I took a green frog photos in a night mode on the clear ground in my backyard, the photo turned out blurry with over exposure from using flash night. That was a disappointment. Also iPhone always added a red or yellow filter on every photo. It does not come from true colour, so all iPhone photos have been processed. All phone company eventually will follow this trend, just try to sell their smartphone.
Quality review ❤
Mega. Pixel. Easy Sub!
Me realising that I have the most comfortable phone 8:03
What wallpaper does he have if anyone can tell me
Someone help me, I don’t know if I get the iPhone 15 pro or the z flip 5, what should I do¿
Watching on my iPhone 15 pro 👍🏼
No😂😂😂 s24 is better
Correction: the iPhone 15 Pro cost $999 and the Pro Max went up $200 (not $100) to $1199.
Hi bro I bought Iphone 15 pro max recently and also I relly love your videos😍.  Can I know if I use the normal USB - c cable for the Iphone ? is it good for the battery ?
Man - you put so much effort into your videos. Admirable.
I definitely think the 11 Pro Max feels better to hold in the hand than the 15 Pro Max does. I also feel like the 13 Pro Max was one of Apple's best built phones. I like that it feels heavier than the 15 Pro Max. To me, a cell phone feels better with a little bit of weight to it instead of feeling so light.
Great video as usual! 💪
The only thing I don’t like about this phone and the 14’s is that they took away the physical sim
Is it worth upgrading from the 11 pro? The biggest draws for me are the screen quality and the camera
Also 18:35 : did you set the time to _15:00_ for the shot to keep up to the iPhone 15?
Just 1 question: 17:31 = If U plug your iPhone into a power bank will the iPhone charge the power bank if you really have to charge and your iPhone which is on 10%?
Just paid for a 15P in full I needed this video to justify my purchase. Thank you 😅
it'd be a great phone if it wasnt so fragile, im on my 3rd back glass.
Someone please tell me they know where I can get the awesome wallpaper he had!?
is the iphone 15 pro water resistant? i need an answer or prove please. thanks
Am I the only one who’s just learnt about this back tap feature 😮
Excelent
Is the iphone 15 pro max actually 120hz because somebody on youtube said its actually not real 120hz. Instead they said its 90hz is that true?
Very good video
I bought an iphone15 pro max.  (Just today)  Before leaving the store. I told them to try to charge the phone..  Aaaaand it shutdown and can't open. So I leave the store without my new phone😅😢
If pixel mobiles would start using Qualcomm's snapdragon chips then it would literally slay the smart phone market
Guys, where can i download the wallpaper  for iphone from this video?
I’m confused, the video started of with iphone 15 pro review, but towards the end started to talk more about iphone 15 pro max…
So 15 pro or 15 pro max …. Which do you think is best for camera?
I need the wallpaper 😂
18:30 iphone 15 pro max price is up by $200 from the iphone 15 pro... math please. Anyway, thanks for the informative video.
This is why you're the review GOAT!!!!
Apple does a lot, that’s why I stay with them. Everything just works. And when I was with Samsung, note phones it just didn’t deliver.
7:49 "ayo chill" got me cackiling
Battery life is horrible.
Anyone can tell me if this is the right choice if I want the best possible recording quality SPECIFICALLY for recording with extra artificial light, overhead, and from up close (but not with zoom)? I record video tutorials for work and I would love to deliver the best possible quality, now I'm using Huawei P30 Pro 😂and the quality is very average, the autofocus is not that good and if I don't lock in the focus and light settings, the lightness changes every half a second and it's just not good. Help!
I’m trying to locate my iPhone on my Apple Watch. I see the find my phone? But it’s not connected to the iPhone. How do I link it?
respect for choosing apple
8:24 the best rickroll so far
Awful color correction. I counted 5 colors on the guy's face. starting from Yellow and ending with Purple. Who is setting the light for these shots? Man, it's 2024!!
Pretty sad that the usb-c is the only reason I see to upgrade from the 13pro but as a video shooter, being able to record ProRes to SSD is a big deal. Top rate review 👌🏻
If you use the action button as the main camera function, then it will feel cameras are completely upside down..
I love the design of the iPhone and especially the 15 Pro but I still went for the S24
Hi Arun!... it's too late to appreciate your impeccable work 🎉....and I do love the wallpaper you are using in the thumbnail... can you share it....
Your sound quality too much good ❤
Who wants to see a cropped shot?
for me its 2000€ in my country
0:43 whats the wallpaper?
Stop hiding behind the dislikes haha
Samsung layout of buttons are best
Could you please do a compari of 15 plus vs 15 pro please comparing camera and other features mainly
I was a samsung user for 13 years, then switched real quick to the iPhone 15 Pro. I can say it is definitely worth it for the features and the price. The only thing that I didn't like was the battery life of the iPhone. That is why I only use it for social media and taking photos, and then my samsung is for gaming.
People complain about how easy to bend the new iPhones are. Bro. Are you fucking sitting on your phone???
idk which SmartPhone i am going to choose bc i like Iphone 15 pro and Samsung Galaxy S22.
Disliked because you didn't mention Resident Evil Village was available for Xbox. Xbox erasure will not be tolerated.
SHIT 😂 s24u sales have out sold Apple 15 in only 7 days 😂😂😂 biggest phone lunch samsung has ever had apple is now officially dead
08:10 left phone wallpaper link
im broke
Where can i get this wallpaper you have on thumb nail?
18:27 i don't mean to be a nerd XD but its going up by 200 and not 100 :p
Too much editing for my taste, doesn't have that down to earth feeling and more like a production
your way of presentation compelled me to see without blinking. Impressive
Anyone know where I can find that wallpaper? Edit: Nevermind! Found it on his twitter, thank you!
Bro had to flex his golden ps5😂
Hi I have a question,should I get the iphone 15 because I heard it has over heating problem?
Most people around the World 🌎 who have an iPhone have photos dating back as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY
Most people around the World 🌍🌎🌍🌎🌍 who have an iPhone have photos dating back as far as far as the YEAR 2023 ONLY
I can’t afford a pro max.. but I can do the 15 pro for sure
So, question. I use a S22 Ultra and have been using Android since forever. Last iphone i used was the 6s i think. Now... the question. Should i change over to iPhone 15 Pro from the S22 Ultra?
i will comment again since yt deletes my "toxic comments" . stop making paid reviews for apple. you think its not obvious at all? why wont you wait 4 months after s24 release AND then compare both phones? you reviewed s24  before its camera update and you didnt even mention it in the reviews that s24 ultra camera does not use full potential. 4 months passed and iphones got few updates. how is this fair?
Disappointed in this review. Dishonest and biased.
Upgraded from iphone 11 to iphone 15 pro max blue titanium and I must say it’s super worth it! I love my new phone. 😊❤
Hello!
It's sad to see that you guys are not addressing the software lags/hangs that we see on iphone these days.  Even the top tech reviewers seems to be bought by apple. Sad to see such state. As a reviewer you should not be aww with iphone like the generic public.  This iphone is not even that durable
wait urs came with a SIM ejector?
Could you sell me an iPhone 15 pro max with SIM card please. I do wonder if the sim card will work on the iPhone in US
i bought 15 pro max and it was terrible its  consume battery when you not use it , and when i brought it to apple store technicians they just try to not doing not accepting the issue and keep screw things up with polite words like it maybe due to applications and i erase everything to original one but they problem still on ,and also i have coverage + but they don't cover it and not doing express replacement.  they seeing it consume battery problem but all they do is trying to avoid support and coverage .
The apple meat riding is crazy in this one. Holy moly.
Where to get that wallpaper though?😅 been looking for it in pinterest but couldnt find anything close
It’s  the best iPhone review I’ve seen so far🙌
Can we play halo on 15pm?😂
As someone who bought it today, for some reason it seems so much better than last year, all my gripes and complaints seem to have disappeared tbh (I have not listened to the apple launch event nor to any other review or any apple related promotion)
eat that apple haters! LOL JK
2:27 - unless one is left handed. Let's not discriminate. ok?
being someone who's left handed, using the action button is so so easy
This feels like a massive over stretch to upsell what is the same phone as a 14 pro and it was rubbish. If you have a 13 pro personally wouldn’t spend your hard earned cash.
U just spent ₱85,990 (PHP) for a 256GB 15 Pro Max = $1,520.82 (USD)  So that $100 difference on pro & promax isn’t really that bigdeal to us in the 🇵🇭😅
I hope you don’t miss like that with a woman… good review otherwise.
You dont even hide it anymore - honest reviews are gone, you are just advertising the device as same as they do. Great shift to the wrong direction. Last video of yours that I watched!
GREAT COMMERCIAL! Hope they pay you properly.
here in Canada, the pro max is over 2000$ CAN
misleading dynamic island on thumbnail its not so sleek
I like this guy.. I will buy iPhone pro instead of max. Thanks 🙏
I really need a good Actually wish I can afford a better phone than an Infinix hot 8
For all of those who didn't know, the iPhone used Samsung screens, Samsung manufacturers' iPhone screens.  They work together, so don't even bother on arguing which phone is better. just enjoy the best of both worlds,life is about options, don't think is only one. And yes Iphone's are now made in china.  China now knows what the 80% of Americans are up to.
Hey bro! Love your videos.. can u tell me how i can run benchmark test on my iPhone 14 pro
if its so good why is apple already promoting the 16?
Terrible revision to IPhone. Mine keeps overheating and just locked up after two months. Had to take it to Apple Store and have it hard reset. The tech said they see it all the time.
Please know that all these are vanity. Waste of time. God do not bring us to this world to come and be playing worth phone.   We are here to worship God, serve him, and live our entire short earthly lives in obedience to his commandments. Those who fulfilled this mission will inherit the true life. Which is the everlasting life in the kingdom of heaven.   Our level of holiness and righteousness we were on earth, will decide how privileged, great, rich and glorious we will be in the kingdom of heaven.      While those who failed to live holy and righteous lives, and did not believe in Jesus as their lord and savior, will be thrown to everlasting punishment in the lake of fire. To be destroyed forever.
I upgraded my iPhone 14 Plus to 15 pro max in blue and loving it
It’s really not better than you think
Apple meatrider
Wonderful piece 🔥
Just got my iPhone upgraded from the 12 so I’m watching this video 3 months late. did anyone call this guy out for saying HDR wasn’t on last gen consoles? Because it definitely was on PS4.
WHO Didn't like his gf😑
real.
Waiting for my pro max next week will come
Still jumping into your seat I see
Are you wearing white nail paint?
Anyone can tell me how to get the wallpaper that is on the thumbnail?
4:18 Why is the time different on each phone 😭😭
Is the zoom of iPhone 15 pro and pro max the same?
The action button is placed amazingly if you’re left handed like me, just a tap on the thumb lol
Jesus is coming back, repent and believe in the gospel, there is no allah, there is no buddha, there is no Mohammed, cuz they are all dead but Jesus lives and he loves u❤
Phones are not meant to be Pro Max unless you have giant hands. I recently upgraded from 14 Pro Max to 15 Pro because of the size. Normally, I never upgrade a phone unless it's not working or else I'd wait for for the iPhone 20 Pro. New phone arrives in 6 hours. We shall see what the buzz is all about.
.
I was skeptical about this phone but because of your review I want to bye bye I but I just can't afford 😞
Im waiting for the mövie why samsung s22 ultra user should choose iphone 😉
voice isolation came out for the 13 series....
Nice - I changed the shortcut button to the camera but totally missed you could select which mode to open at, Thanks!
Why does he sound like that 😂😂
Just bought use for 10 minute it’s get heat.👎👎👎not happy.😊
Where can i get your cool wallpaper? Please
As someone who has had budget phones (including iPhone SE 1st gen and 2nd gen right before this one) I absolutely love this phone! I can’t go back. It’s like going from 60fps to 30fps, you just can’t do it.
These days its difficult to spot a difference between these smartphones hardware wise. The battle is becoming more of software one than hardware.
The cable is a fast charge you just need to order a 20watt box.
where is the purple wallpaper from?
Forgot for a moment I got iPhone 15 pro last week 😂 btw amazing review ❤
Cool!  but can it run roblox.
As much as I wish I could use my phone completely without a case I can’t I try my hardest to keep my phone in pristine condition by using a fully protective case
If you love iphone and think that Joe Biden is the best president that ever was, good for you. Kepp on keeping on. But if you have half a brain, you can see that this phone is unreasonable priced and useless. Wow it has 6e wifi, Just like a pixel 6 has. Wow it can play console game. Why would you tho on a tiny iphone? For that money you can buy a console and a decent TV. It breaks easier than any iphone ever, as any iphone it loses charge in cold like in a few seconds. Despite the fact that you are so dense that you need a iphone for film and photography. Just buy  a decent camera. Still gonna be better quality. I get that it has the best software optimization but thats about it. Its a brand, you pay for the brand, not for the quality. They are the nvidia of phones. People call inovation ebery year about things that androids have long ago. I mean i dont hate iphones, just saying its not priced well. People in reviews just try so hard to upsell these things. If you love them, good for you, keep on buying and supporting them. I just dont see the point wasting money on them.
Dynamic island . definitely hinders the game display😮
Literally same script as mkbhd
what a waste of money I literally just got the 14 like six months ago or however, long was last Christmas. I can’t do math I didn’t need a new phone. Jesus Christ.
The voice isolation feature is actually on a software level, my 14 also has it!
Same thing, over and over😂 Just like a buying  a volkswagen ,and a audi, 😂😂
Amazing video, as always! Can you share the wallpaper that is shown in the thumbnail?
Except for the build quality everything is good
I use the default cable with fast charger block and my iPhone 15 pro charges from 10%-100% in an hour.
i couldnt stop staring at that chain. 21/22k or 24?
4:16 wysi
Me watching this on an iPhone 15 pro:
torn between s23 ultra and 15 pmax, thanks for this review
camera comparison didn't come this year as you said in your video. against s23 ultra
i thought all comments will be "ayo chill"  😆😆😆😆
I love everything about the phone except the front camera. It sucks terribly. Selfies come out very dark and grainy
What would you pick for someone with low vision 15 pro or 16 pro max
wait until it breaks inside your pocket
Could have talked about the build quality? Since there were a lot of buzz about bending/breakage
I like iphone i do but they are always behind on there software. Battery is trash and there phine pruce is just a joke. I feel like thet NEVER listen to the customers they do what THEY think we would like. I meam ita 2023 and usb c has inly happend also always on display i mean come on apple!
Should I get iphone 15 or iphone 15 pro?
You can tell he is happy about S21 features finally making it to Apple😊  To save yall time on what it's really about..its 60%+ of Samsung features coming through so I would understand why most Galaxy users would have a hard time searching for what makes the new iPhone cool buy once you realise alot 'Apple Way' stuff, even though little improvement they do make a possible a noticeable pile😅  Yes watching 5 minutes of this video will probably make you wonder why there is even a newer iPhone, 10 minutes will be like..ehn classic Apple and adding 1 or 2 features but watching everything will be like okay..not half bad but should probably wait for the 16 for a more noticeable difference.  Something S22 Users came to conclude about the S23 or similar atleast..good stuff but I will take my time alittle even though other features are admirable but paying over 400 for 1 feature..not really worth it so yeah.
I WISH to have a iPhone 15 pro or a iphone 14 pro😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Where can i get that wallpaper???
Where is the wallpaper from?
What is the required adapter watt for iPhone 15 pro max
This is your original voice bro
Just got my 15 Pro Max and its my 1st ever iphone 😂 all my life if been on android and i can say its premium both hardware and software, overall a well rounded phone ❤ my only problem is the action button is useless 😅
So is the “voice isolation” a setting….as in the phones settings menu…..or is it an option selected on a case by case choice?
cool Motorola logos  in the background
hi
🤦😂😂 Arun wants to say that buying the 15 pro max is worthless if you have a 12 or 13
Can we use this action button to pickup calls?? Definitely gonna help sweaty palms... 😢
This was one of the best reviews ever! I just purchased the iPhone 15 Pro and I'm glad I made a good choice.
Hi, wallpaper link please ? Where can I find them ?
Just looking this vidéo on my IPhone 15 Pro acquired today
I miss the days when we had charging brick in the box
I’m on 15 pro and the quick action isn’t hard to reach, I keep pressing it instead of the higher volume button
I am totally happy with my pro max.  I wish they would upgrade the ultra wide as I use that for a lot of my videos.
Paid actor😂
A follow up video should be done for the spatial video. I just finished a trip to Japan with all the beautiful autumn leaves and to have been able to record 3d 4k video would have been awesome to view back on my quest 2 head set.
Where can I find your wallpaper?
Should I use Camera Lens Protection for iPhone 15 pro max? @Mrwhosetheboss
What wallpaper are you using?
woah, your are doing some quality work. appreciated
You can already use the volume up button for the camera and the voice isolation is also available for older (non-pro) phones. So on a practical level it isn't a noticeable upgrade from my iPhone 13...
This is the best review of Iphone 15 pro max on YT. Normally a MKBHD fan but this review trumps his because of the topics you discuss
After overheating and unexpected shutdowns, Apple iPhone 15 users facing new problem with their smartphones: Report
7:51 SUS
Man I spent like four years building up my entertainment setup all apple. It was slow cause I’m poor and I bought everything outright.. no payment plans or credit, I saved. iPhone 11 first in 2019. Then got some Bose QC35ii.. then the MacBook M1 Air (amazing). Then got the AirPods Pro 2 and love them.   My issue now is my battery in the iPhone 11 is shot. My options for replacement aren’t practical. So.. here I am watching iPhone 15 videos non stop.   I will somehow fandango a way to get an iPhone 14/15 fully paid off within the year! And then I’ll update how good it is. I’m motivating myself. I’m a simple man.. 128gb non-pro is fine for me. Just the standard iPhone with a fresh battery and is ~1 year old or newer.   We all are here daydreaming the same thing so thank you Arun (hope I spelt right) 👍
DO NOT BUT THIS PHONE!! I bought it I regret buying due to overheating. All these idiots are paid by Apple to promote Iphone.  Over heating issue has not been resolved. Do not buy. !
We should sell our kidney for this phone😂
You like paddington station?
Who is watching this for the entertainment but don't got the money to actually the phone😂😂
Arun's about to become a true dad joker.🤣🤣🤣
A very right handed perspective on the action button section (I’m well aware lefties are a small minority) but I love its placement as a lefty personally, and even when I do use it in my right hand it’s near my index finger usually 🤷🏿‍♂️
I always wonder how they make exactly the same pictures on two systems...  🤔
Better then you think... I was better payment from Apple better then you thing... payment Apple Youtuber....shame of you!
7:52 lmao😂
Coming to the resolution of the camera, the Mi 11 takes 27 MP shots, what about that
"The tap" Im a new yorker but i love it. Think ill start using it.
you actually missed the most important bit ...the usb makes it compatible with streaming audio hardware ...for singers streamers etc but edit ....it over heats and breaks really easily therefore its the worst i phone ever made
Bruh the voice isolation thing is crazy. Imagine calling your girl while she getting her cheeks clapped by another dude. She uses this feature to remove the moans/clapping sounds while talking to you.
well, you could press the shutter button with your thumb when it's below the phone in landscape mode
"Call quality"😅...Sucking off apple at every chance given at this point.
Is your phone 1 sim or 2 sim?
Love iPhone 15 pro
I finally updated from the 13 pro to 15 pro. I’ve been an iPhone user since 2008, this has been my smoothest upgrade ever. So easy that when I hit a password screen, I’m startled because I keep forgetting.
All these big youtubers seem to be paid by Apple or just say shit which pleases the crowd. Nothing substantial has changed but they always say shit like 'this is the best'.
I will buy but I am not sure which color I get. Natural titanium looks really good but blue titanium looks good too.
Just today I got my iPhone 15 pro black color but I have iPhone 14 Pro Max 512 GB but I love my new 15 pro 256 GB it is so cute small phone
I’m just here to say your fiancée is very beautiful
voice isolation is insane
Hey Arun !!!! i wanted to ask if your or any other Tech Youtubers will Do a video on the APPLE's latest ECOFRIENDLY Psychologically Political Propaganda They released where they went soooo hard on the "MESSAGE "  THEY LITERALLY SAID: THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO END "ALL CARBON" FROM THE WORLD (LITERALLY EVERYTHING THAT LIVES IS MADE OUT OF CARBON)
I stick mine in low battery mode and it goes 1 1/2 days, love it!
Hey Mr. Arun, with deep respect on your passion with work, i would like to report something to you  I have found that iPhone 15 pro back & front camera processes images so badly after taking photos to grainy, noisy and dark ( this can be easily replicated with front cameras , the image shown in viewfinder while taking photos is completely different after the photo is taken )  I have seen thousands of reports of this exact same issue in apple user forums  Hope this Comment gets your attention and you would test it out on fair and dark skinned people and it would be great if you address it as a video so both apple and your viewers recognises it   From a Long Standing Subscriber ❤
You are just the best , thank you for this
I love my iPhone 15 Pro. I have had it since late September 2023.
can you tell us how to editing like the videos like you and which app is best for editing
NO ONES ACTUALLY GONNA NOTICE THAT WHEN HE SAYS IPHONE CAN TAKE PICTURES FASTER,  THE SAMSUNG HAD LIVE PHOTO ON AND THAT WOULD TAKE MORE TIME
I wish you would give  us some of the phone you test
Been convincing myself to upgrade to this phone, have watched several videos. I am now sold by this one ❤
The commercials are not letting the real third lenses ,reveal ,or people say on their opinions say on it ,lol how convenient lol
Oh wow NOW THERES NO LONGER a third Lenz lol
Nice phone stand! Mine keeps moving around.
Upgrade every 3-4 years and these phones are great
hey boss. You chite me ago 2years 🤐😔
Is the lens protectors for the iPhone a must ? A concern consumer
Meritmeter uses AI to evaluate Youtube reviews like Mrwhosetheboss review, to evaluate the overall reviews score and  IPhone 15 PRO scored High merits. You can go ahead and buy it.
Did you leave the torch on on purpose or was this an oversight? 15:18
Great review. Makes me want to buy it. Even though I know that s23 has a far better camera.
Can anyone tell me what is the use of those apple stickers??
Heyy please post more on the iphone 15 pro 😂
how many takes to get the shot of you throwing and catching the phone? hahah
No sim in the American version 😢
I didn’t find any difference. How much money apple gave you?
Should I purchase iphone 15 pro?😊
great
Mega Pixel ahhhahhhhhahhahh-. I love your jokes. Keep it up! 👍
1.5k for a phone, and no charger. When the centre of the 'features' advert is 'titanium' you know its a poor facelift of the 14. 'our fastest phone yet' well it would be concerning if it wasn't faster than its predessessor
Only 9 likes? 👍 (Thanos voice) Impossible!
Where is the link of this wallpaper ?
I remember those camera features were available on the Nokia Lumias. My 920 and 1020 had those features built in as well. Nokia was ahead of its time for sure when it came to cameras and software.
I upgraded from a good old iPhone 7 Plus to a iPhone 15 Pro and i was stunned 😧 i know its a big upgrade but bro omg
Hi, where is the pic on the lockscreen? Could you provide a link please?
Where can i find the wallpaper used in iphone? Thank you
He has a rack of mobiles meanwhile me just imagininng of buying these mobiles.  Anyways love your videos !!
Every year new device that isn't actually so new.
Hey.. Can you please make a video on the best chargers and cables for the new 15 pro?
They bought you finally.
Amazing video
What I love most is the type C port! I was always thinking about switching to android just because of that. Such a small change, but to me it made an impact on my daily carry.
I’ve literally just bought a 15 pro and I’ll admit I’m very impressed it’s so fast and so powerful brilliant iPhone 📱
First review that actually talks about changes in so much details. Great job!
Man …voice isolation isn’t a iphone 15 exclusive feature. Such a big channels but lacks research
The action button is perfect for anyone left handed ^^
I got the 15 pro and am very happy with it, no complaints.  My previous phone was a pixel 7
how much money apple paid you sallee
Yesterday I tried to share some photos from my iphote to my windows and guess what, the love photo is a separate video if you share the picture to windows 😢🤯
talk ab the durability
lol it's 1,6k€ for the pro max here in europe
we might need more consistent family friendly content to become the world's largest tech community
Essentially I'm look at the same phone for the past 4years ..imo
Mr.bean 😂😂
15 pro is the perfect phone ever
Great review
No mention of HeifMax or JpegMAX?
Loved this!!! Thank you 😊
My iPhone 12 has voice isolation so it’s not new
Android is for people who know nothing about tech
Iphone 999
Where can i get the purple WALLPAPER from? Even google pictures didnt found it
A good review for an apple product? Revolutionary moment for the one Apple fan that didn't switch to something else
Getting this phone in 2 days and this video helps thx 👍🏼 but are u resting your phone on your cat 💀big W
54 more iPhones until the funniest iPhone
Which phone should I consider 15 pro or 15 plus?
A link for your wallpaper? Cheers
bro really took a picture zooming up his beard  Smooth man, Smooth
Being a lefty is very handy with iPhone ig😂😂
Hey can you start giving us your wallpaper links please
Amazing Technology, just switched from Android my last iPhone was iPhone 7. 15 pro max has so many features 😳
Action button, you're obviously not left handed.
I play Baulder’s gate 3 on my iPhone 15. Using GeForce now.
Got that shit for 140$ 🤣🤣🤣 paid in full bet y'all can't beat that 🤣 financing your life away for a phone 🤣🤣🤣
You should watch tech spurt
In 6:27 what wallpaper is on that iPhone please
This is the first time I’ve ever heard of the backtap feature
I still have iPhone 15 pro they get me gift 😂😂😂😂 it’s was free
Call quality changed a lot from 11 gen and 12 gen.
Love your reviews. One of only a few tech follows for me
Ive watch tech videos for a minute  They are okay.  But for some reason i loved this one. Is my first time  Seeing one of your videos  And in.  1 sub from me. 🤩❤️
Can you make an apple watch series 9 review plz?
MY BROTHER HAS THE IPHONE15PRO MAX
bro actually rickrolled us at 8:22💀
Gaming a gimmick for a device so small and destroying the battery life in no time
Bro has the all phone which excites in the whole universe
Did they copy voice focus mode from Samsung 🤔
best review ever. its even better then original Apple reviews!
6:47 WOW what an action!  Love it
how to decide which lens to use as far as cycling the main camera?
Been using voice isolation since 13 Pro Max.  It does a great job on video calls outdoors.
Honestly these phones are tedious. So far bahind Samsung its unreal.
Seems like this reviewer is pushing too much , really. As there is nothing major, he is trying his best to highlight small things.. now getting bored of iphone.

if i am going to sell my soul i better sell it for the right price , great job my Next Level
Nah  the isues with technology  today is do you want device you own and control vs a device that has control taken from you     Its the same reason  why windows is better  is Linux  is better all the pc os is just freedom   Apple charges £5k for a device that restricts what you can achieve  on it vs a proper workstation pc is the same reason  why android phones do everything
suchhh high quality video production and editing. you are rly setting the standard!
Apple is a joke
Need Review about cons in it
I upgraded from iPhone X so most things are new to me hehe
iPhone overpriced, but good camera and iOS.
But does it have magic eraser?
He sounds so pretentious
i see the pixel 8 has the ability to reduce things like wind noise during videos, do iphones do this too? havent had an iphone since iphone 3
I don’t know how peoples phones get that dirty…
Many people say that the iphone 15 pro max selfie camera oversharpens the photos. I felt like that as well. Could you please make a video on it?
So google are lying and cutting corners - showing you what a phone could be instead what the phone you're buying is? Sounds like any other Google launch
Broooo no puedes tener 16 millones de subs y no tener tu doblaje a otros idomassssss
Someone please assist me! I’m using iPhone 8 plus almost 5 years, and now planning to upgrade. So which one should I buy, 14 pro max or 15 pro max?
If that side button is hard for u to reach u gotta have the worlds smallest hands😭
This was not mentions in any channel WUNDERFIND by tapping on blue time icon on Home Screen
How much does Apple pay you to help them sell more iPhones?
Did you do durability test and heating issues review???😢
Cool phone, but one sim is bad enough let alone no sim. I'd be fine with it if verizon and at&t had the same sim/esim freedom as google fi. Why are sim cards in America so silly? Just give every flagship 4 imeis (2 physical & 2 esim), that would be a good first step.
that corny "mega" joke was so corny it made me subscribe lol
@Mrwhosetheboss   Hello, the annual reviews done on iPhone devices; you must admit are not evolving and your coverage does not cover anything that isn't already known. Instead of reading off spec lists that are readily available and provided by the source company themselves, it is time to evolve.  IDEA: start covering product launch device issues and user reported problems around new devices. Talk about the transition process from one eco-system to another and how it has changed over the year, or even the process from iPhone to iPhone, maybe even trade in values and current offers.   That kind of coverage will yield greater gains for the industry instead of viewers wondering why they are watching a B or C production level third party wannabe keynote.
What's up with that stupid "falling into the chair" routine??? Time for an upgrade in the intro? 😂
This is one of the most professional and thorough reviews I’ve seen of anything
All youtubers trying to sell us a pathetic product wothout innovations
@Mrwhosetheboss you going to use your 14 pro?🤲
biased review , all i can say.
I will not suggest to buy iphone.. after iphone 7 all iphone has internet issue and low wifi connectivity.. in many places my nokia 13000 mobile is able to connect wifi but same place iphone not.. and internet issue i have always faced .. also i think this new screen resolution quality makes your eye issues..
For daily use and content professionals, should I buy: iphone 14 pro max or 15 plus or 15 pro?
Very good review abt iPhone 15 series! 👏👌
Unboxing with GLOVES ? where did you buy this from ? A hospital ?
I sold my iphone 15 for fentanyl. Back to my iphone 11 pro baby
Awesome video ! Waiting for my 15 pro max to come in the mail . I haven’t upgraded my phone since the 11 pro max so hopefully the 15PM will last at least 4 years too
Arun you convinced me to upgrade my iphone 14 pr
For sure! Bend level. 😅😂
I see multiple reviewers mentioning "Voice Isolation" on 15, why ? when this is a software feature introduced in iOS 16.4, for all iPhones i think.
5m views is crazy lol
First time apple user.  Got iPhone 15 pro and I have to say I’m loving iPhone 15 pro. I get better reception better user satisfaction. Look and feel is very nice. Performance is good and camera is amazing.
The edit cuts and effects, the music, the speed he speaks at make this video a pretty unpleasant experience
This has to be the most boring lackluster iphone ever since iphone 12 but isheep will keep sucking.
Hands down the best review I have seen for the iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Max 🙌🏾
nobody talking about the post-processing on pictures on the selfie camera that completely ruin your photos to the point people are screenshotting or shooting in burst to avoid it?
Im just gonna use the action button as silent mode anyways
I switched from an iphone 13 pro to a 15 pro after listening to these youtube reviews, but I now regret spending so much money nothing but just for the new notch. These youtubers solely think from their own perspective, not from the standpoint of the average user.
Is there anyone who is also experiencing problems with their iPhone 15 Pro regarding the touch? I have a screen protector on and I have to press hard and multiple times sometimes for it to register??? Without my screen protector, the touch works flawlessly.
The scene at 7:50 is a bit awkward I would say. 👽  For such a high profile video
Base model is 999$ and the pro max is going by 100$ more which is 1199$.  Nice math mr Arun. 18:26
Very biased review imo!
Most uncreative and boring iPhone ever !!! 😤
Now if apple can make a good foldable at least the quality of the 15pro max, I'd  switch immediately.
Bro the wallpaper is lit where can i get it ?
Battery health on my 14 Pro Max has been significantly worse than prior models. My 12 Pro Max and 13 Pro Max were at 96% and 97% after one year. My launch day 14 Pro Max is already down to 92% with no notable changes in usage or charging
The iPhone 15 actually looks good
Can someone find me wallpaper from thumbnail on iphone? Purple stars,something like that? Thanks
Please share a link to the wallpaper used in your thumbnail?
This is the kind of shit only the people watch that aren't ignorant schmucks or already know there's more to it. The average iPhone user cries every year "THE DESIGN HASN'T CHANGED, SAME PHONE HURR DURR". But that's the same people who have iPhones as a status symbol rather than for what it can truly do. I hate this world.
Better than you think.  Worst than you expect
Titanium…the same metal that my lacrosse stick was made from in 1997. Blah.
You said that smaller file also stored the live photo data at the same time, but only if you have live photo enabled not ?
Day 3  of asking misterwhoistheboos please do a ecosystem comparison as Samsung, apple and xalmy have laptos tablits and phones and headphones
just buy a case but love the reviews
This is, by far, the best and most conclusive iPhone 15 Pro review on the internet! Great job!
I've love of how this my favorite YouTuber that she is so good at anything
The bigist new feture is if you use wireless charging, it will fry any computer it's connected to  the bigist lawsuit, which is starting soon from peoples who's car computers got fried
You can go in settings > camera > format and turn on PRO RAW and capture 48MP but to activate it you need to be in the camera app and press it (it's next to live toggle and live doesn't work with it)
Bro is your phone going to space
I just think as they are doing these incremental zoom by tapping,  they should also let you decide first with the x3 and then x5. Getting the same great quality out
Tell me you are paid by Apple without telling me you are paid by Apple
Just ordered mine! Great review, can’t wait to play around with it!
you're a nerd and you have a girlfriend ?? !! big up champ!! I'm impressed and proud of you my dude :D
Just saying, the voice isolation stuff is on every phone.
Beta what is
when ever youyou buy a new iphone after a few weeks they are look the same.   I always wait tell my cell provider has  a new plane and i always get a free new phone.  why spend so much on a new phone this is why people are all ways so broke.
if you where to want to get this phone just wait a year and buy it used for around £200 less (right now a used iphone 14 good condition is around £600)
When you sitting on chair why you jumping
Your presentation style earned you a new subscriber. Brilliant!
paid for by Apple
Interesting that the non-USA models of the phone still retain a physical SIM card slot. I wish we could still have that.
I really don’t like the dynamic island for sitting farther away from the edge thus taking up more space. I’ll get the iPhone 14.
I want to upgrade to the 15 pro but I’ve herd a lot of people say the titanium is really fragile…
I just clicked on the video just to open it. And u made me watch for 11 minutes 😂 👏🏻. Good job. By the way, I’ll continue watch later 😉
I’ve just ordered a 15PM, currently using a 13PM.. really appreciate any feedback, is it worth it? I can cancel my order if I get enough “NO DONT DO IT”
Anyone using 15 pro after the update? Is there any issues still? Worth to buy ?
Very awesome review you and mkbhd and flossy carter are the goat reviewers of phones i love every detail of this video and now i am actually know a lot in this phone
Why don’t you clean your phone there’s not supposed to be dirt in the mute switch and what do you mean by you can’t clean the phone every day that’s literally what you’re supposed to do
I can’t stand this guy. Soooooo uncharming and smug for what?? 🤢
Nobody is talking about how apple took inspiration from the nothing phone(2) with those rounded edges.....
Where i get that wallpaper??
I used to have an iPhone 8 so this was an upgrade for sure haha.
shut
Can I get one for free? I will love the pro❤😊
Hey, you have some tray phone. Where did you get these, Canada or UK?
I wonder  How did you play resident evil on it? Was that emulator there?
BS it's a phone.
I like how you review certain things but im sure you cant expect a phone to improve your speech ot the fact of your fingers covering the camera because of the button being placed as well as the fingerprints. that is up on how the user
Who can give a better review than you?!
poor gf, doing dishes... 😆
If the photos weren't compressed from 48MP to 24MP, there actually would be no difference between the shots @ 13:44 - is that right? I already get that the focal length doesn't change, so neither do one's face proportions. In that sense 1-2.9x is pure digital zoom, correct me if I'm wrong
No matter what Apple does I'll never get iPhone unless in some dystopian future Apple buys all phone companies and they are the only phone company available than and only than will I consider buying one
Mrwhose can I ask you something?
the voice isolation also comes in the iphone 14 pros
This video didn't age well
I honestly can’t stand to watch these videos anymore. They’re so fast and flashy and Edward in a manner that just demands my attention. I hate it.
Apple is the best. The rest will follow
What do you search up for the wallpaper Aron?
Fake tech reviewer
This mrwhosetheboss is paid bias
Its actually kinda sad that everyone started hating on the phone cuz jre broke the back glass and everyone left. no one looked deeper at what improvements apple has made
Apple can personally thankyou for the iphone 15 pro ive just purchased, this video 100% sold me on it!!! Great video, Subbed and Liked (also dropped 1k on a new phone lol)
Tbh is it worth it to upgrade from the 14 pro?
Can all of you please put on cases on your 1600$ phones? Especially you content creators. And then ppl cry why it cracked or bent in pocket like the iPhone 11 max did. Yeah I never had any issues and always was able to resell my phone with minimal damage.
The recent changes in iPhone photos don't sit well with me. It feels like they're relying too heavily on software tweaks, neglecting hardware improvements. Consequently, they end up over-editing and removing the natural imperfections that give photos their uniqueness and memorability. Apple's approach often leaves photos feeling lifeless. In my view, a great camera should aim to capture moments rather than just "fix" them.
Most definitely not next level.
The battery life on the 15 pro is simply not good at all. Mine barely lasts 3-4 hours just watching YouTube or listening to music
WHO REALLY CARES?
Open your eyes…they are all the same devices
Nice review, omit the music and too many effects. 11 Pro max is still worth it.
It’s awesome that it has great speed but the screen and graphics are so behind the Samsung phones.
Why do they want to increase the price of titanium
Music is so annoying
It's next level shit
Nice review. A correction. Hdr is not a feature of ps5 also of ps4(resident evil reference)
Will usb 3 charging burn the battery faster u think?
Nice
🤣🤣
Got a link for that purple awesome wallpaper?
I’m confused i have watch so many vids about iphone 15 is it good or not
Honestly, with all the overheating and durability problems right now, I would just get a used 14 pro max. It's cheaper and is more durable. Or, if you want something different, than an s23 ultra, z fold 5, or z flip 5 will do you well for years. And even the foldable are more durable than the 15 pro max.
Voice isolation was on iPhone before iPhone 15
Yum
Someone who actually takes the time to notice the details before creating an opinion that follows the trend
4:54 using your cat as a phone stand 😂😂😂
Poor customer service from Apple after recent heating issue . Pixel is way better than iPhone
Where can i find that wallpaper?
Can you talk more on the battery comparisons? I almost don't want to send my 13 pro mac back because it was the best battery on any device that I have ever had! It's hard to give that up.
im an android user here and i was planning to switch to iphone and i wanna ask the community here... SHOULD i get the iphone 15 >? ( pls help im in a dilema)
Been using redmi note 7 for last 6 years , I think it's time for me to upgrade         after i become rich🥲
The word SHIT comes  to my mind when it comes to APPLE 15
No word about overheating? Little word a about battery? Hmm, i think you are payed to say all the best for this mobile which is not a true. You should read a rededit and other sites to se the real problems with tjis iphone 15 series...
Apple didn’t have enough budget for the user experience team this time.😂
I watch these videos despite not being able to afford any of the tech
Action button!? Apple discovered the "bixby button" samsung used to have
@mrwhosetheboss still you haven't answered my question , how much did you got paid from @apple for this review. Be honest please I know plenty of people got the same question!
How do you do the back tap thing?
great video, but price for the pro is 200$ more (not 100)
Safe to say we all use our cats as a prop up thingie 😅😅
First time owning an iPhone (specifically this one reviewed) and I'm amazed how the image quality seems almost at par with those coming from a large sensor camera.  I ca only hope that Apple will someday release a standalone large sensor camera with all their software smarts inside it.
planning to upgrade my iphone 11 pro. do you suggest i upgrade to iphone 15 plus, 15 pro or 15 pro max in terms of camera, performance, battery life and durability in relation to value for money? will use a case.
Are there issues with the iPhone pro max heating up
great, now i can tell my boss i'm sick whilst im really stood in someones kitchen at 7 am :D
Consumerism at worst
“All day battery life “ … I am so disappointed from iPhone 15 pro , don’t buy please … battery life is so bad , it’s didn’t worth , when we are paying so much money at least must be normal battery Apple is joking to us … I feel so so bad , don’t make this mistake.
New iPhone has NavIC chipset, u forgot to mention
Pro or Pro Max? Which one to get?
The seven focal lenses is just for the Pro Max
Watching on my black iPhone 15pro
The phone's Straight up sh*t and Titanium is gimmick Display is sh*t it burned up so fast it couldn't even stand against s23 ultra  The phone bends easily and breaks  And for iphone 15 the phone lags after bending like wtf why are people wasting money bruh give something that's worth And i hate arun that he always stands for iphone I don't know why maybe because they pays him more money
As far as the iPhone 15 overheating issue, any software fix to overcome a Hardware issue is a sham. You’ll be neutering the iPhone by reducing the efficiency of the cpu and battery your reasons for buying it in the first place.
Hi can I have your iPhone 14 pro 😌
Y no mention of the heating issues during simple tasks? This phone is trash. Bought my wife 1 this week, too much battery drain and heating while browsing web and insta. I'll return it soon and then go for pixel 8 or s24 once it launches
I love how nobody talks about how the iPhone is actually trash for the price compared to androids that are half the price and can blow it out of the water. Apple is a joke for inventing shit android has had for all these years.
I’m so pumped for my new iPhone to arrive. Now that it has usbc I’m gonna be holding on to this phone for longer than I held on to my iPhone 11 Pro Max. I’ll replace the battery before I replace the phone.
I want an iphone so bad though
The iPhone 14 pro is not “very heavy” that’s a ridiculous thing to say.
How am I just now finding out that you can tap the back of the phone to do things?!?!
after last video im pretty sure he get paid lot by apple lol
I just want them to make a phone in the shape of an apple
tbh I am disappointed by you at this point. Everyone knows that 15 pro max it has minimalistic features rather than previous gen,and yet you're not being transparent and truthful about the review but you're mentioning some useless features about this new iPhone so you can brainwash your subscribers so they can get the newest version. I am curious about only one thing because I know it is big but how much did apple paid you to do this review? 🙄
Its not better. Sorry to say
Well thought of video - very nice 👍🏻
Okay, Tim Paid well.😂😂😂
Can i have one iphone 15?
So it seems there is still nothing really to do with all the power and all the gimmicks. This is a great review, up to the normal MWTB standards, but the things highlighted here - with the exception of the voice isolation feature - is brilliant but really, I still see no reason to even consider upgrading from my iPhone 13.
Great👏😊
Wow😲🤩
Ok, but why? Who actually uses all this? There's like 1k people that have a use for these features.
Love this channel...
definitely a paid video
I'm sorry, but the people who will be happy with the "7 lens" system and marketing are the same ones who don't have a camera, don't want to learn how to use a camera, and there fore don't even want a camera... So to say it's icky, doesn't matter 1 lil bit, as they will just pay attention to the framing and how it looks sharing over messages or socials and will be happy...
Yes but haven’t you seen all the drop tests other YouTuber have been making the iPhone 14 pro is far off more resistant that the 15 pro due to the flat edges and the stainless steel. I’ll just save 1,200 dollars this year and wait for the iPhone 16 pro max to arrive see if it’s any better. I dare you to drop test compare iphone 15 pro vs iphone 14 pro see who is the real winner when it comes to durability. Fashion accessory the 15 pro because it breaks so quick.💀
After seeing this video after few weeks of release, i would say you to use the phone before review and dont get into ads
Can anyone gift me iphone 15 pro max 😭😂😂
Hii i really like your videos they are clear and honest , kindly requesting you to address the issues in the new 15pro max, would like to get clarity about the heating issue and also durability of the phone especially focusing the back glass and display
Mrswhostheboss?!?!?!
What background is that purple on his 15 pro max
Ahh so no real improvements. On the iPhone 13 Pro Max and have most of these features already. Was at the very least hoping for more ram. With how much of a buggy mess apples apps are and how bad it’s been at handling 3rd party apps I don’t really see a reason to stick to iPhone other than the ecosystem.  Also does anyone actually care about the cameras? All of these phone companies are trying to push phones because of their cameras but how many people out there care enough to spend that price just for some slightly better pics? I mean maybe if you’re an influencer, sure but for the average user doubt any of that matters.
Wallpaper?
Send me one too , I'm a subscriber for almost 9 years
I heard Apple has fixed the overheating issue. 15 pro now comes with 'amazing ' oven glove 😂
The 15 Pros having better heat dissipation than the 14 Pros? Want to know more cuz this is just the first time I don't hear the opposite.
Apple Buying Youtubers People Buying Apple  😂 Nice Marketing 🤭
I can buy a phone, a new PS5, monitor, UPS, Speakers, Extra Controllers everything with the price of iPhone15 Pro Max
Mrwhosetheboss: Phone 15 is Better than you think  JerryRigsEverything: iPhone 15 is worse than you think
I really was the one who was waiting for the new iPhone release date. But now after a large amount of negative feedback regarding the heat, durability, and quality issues, I am really disappointed in the iPhone 15. From my personal side, I don't care if the iPhone has any wireless charging. I did love my iPhone 5 with the aluminum back frame. At this level, where the customer paying a bunch of money, they should make a compromise about whether they want something cool within an extremely short life or something quality.  if the phone has more metal on the structure, that means the final product is more rigid and durable. That helps also the heat distribution.  I would choose maybe a kind of solution on the back side of the phone like Mcsafe.  some magnetic connectors with springs - which could hold and charge the phone on one docking station, making easy connection possible for drivers. But now it looks like Apple going in the wrong direction. If something works great, then why need to find another solution? Same story with Mcsafe ones removed then back again, then the keyboards. Also, I`m a bit disappointed, that Apple moved the manufacturing to India, within a very short time switching the production, which course a lot of investment, and quality issues based on iPhone 15 negative feedbaks. For customer's information, when an industry decides to make any relocation for their manufacture, there are always financial losses, that need to be compensated somehow. As like release a new product or existing one quickly. Quickly means less time for Validation of function, safety, durability, and quality. Now I plan to change my existing laptop and Im afraid to wait till released the new M3-equipped MacBooks. The question is, those will be released too fast again? And the customers will pay for that?  It looks like Apple Validation engineers has no physical possibility to keep up with the new product release time. Also, those customers who are addicted to owning the latest technology, they also not able to keep up with Apple's strategy.   The current MacBook has an ugly black color between the keyboard, personally, I prefer those old ones with metal frames, like the Air.  I really don't like the SD and the HDMI port, why do we need these dust collector ports, previously Apple encouraged all their customers to purchase usb -c / whatever adapter. What will be the next, iPad with HDMI?    No issue with stainless still or aluminum frame, but it has a problem with thin titanium if you put a not durable back. And another question,, I do not understand,, why and why the previous version has an extremely high price after the following ones were released.  " because those are still much more durable?"
Share the Wallpaper Link  @mr
Super video maare saavu 🤯 Vottraasi yedde ithundu.  Bokka? Gammatha?
I only wait for the "catchphrase." I don't know if that's what you call it 😅😅   After that I leave, cause that's the Mega..... interest for me 😁😁
Nice review
Let's jst wait for the s24 ultra 😂
Nice
amazing series
Great review! I have my new 15 pro max in hand and its amazing. I also might have missed it in your review....very good
wallpaper? pls
Not really, more of the same with minimal changes.
He said we’ve addressed he is working with Apple
Torn between the iPhone 15pro and the 14 pro max. I currently have the 12 that has physical issues
Very nice post production
Can you explore heat in the 15 pro max? In use and charging?
Stupid amount of megapixels is pretty much irrelevant for picture quality. Photography 101. It’s only relevant if you’re making a really huge print, so the detail doesn’t blur.
This time around, I am not going to buy an iPhone based on You tube reviews.
i have to admit your really impressive; you just made a 20 minute video differentiating two identical things.
Where can I get this wallpaper, Anyone?
Ill never pay so much cash  for Iphone that has close to no difference than lets say iphone 13
Why not use your thumb for the action button?
Pixel's voice isolation for calls is mind blowing
Can you get a heat test and a minor drop test on the pros
Just ordered mine! First new phone I’ve ordered since the 11 it looks well worth the upgrade
10:30
Nice review cheers  How are you playing resident evil village? As it’s only out on 30th Oct ? Any guide to an early access version?
Isn‘t Voice Isolation an old feature?
regardless of what others say i like my iphone 15 pro max, if something happens i will just use my apple care lol 😂
Cleaning the iPhone with your t-shirt is such a desi thing :D
Hasn’t voice isolation always been there though?
18:24 The prices..... "The iPhone 15 is staying at 999 and The Pro Max is going up by a 100 to 1199". But uhm isn't it going up by 200 dollars from 999 to 1199 ?
Phone overheated while play and charge, break easily. People are not dumb. Stop glazing Iphone.
How can you play in a console in aphone
Still waiting for the real review.
S23 ULTRA STILL THE KING BABY!!! 👑📱  YOU CANT TAKE US DOWN BOY!!! 💯💯🔥🔥
Don't you get tired of the dsme thing again and again?
Yeah low level , microwave
Gaming on a phone is impossible to do and enjoy it once you’ve spent some time gaming on an iPad Pro and in turn once you’ve played on a high end monitor it’s impossible to really enjoy playing on an iPad Pro. I game a lot less as a result, which is actually a bonus.
OMG! I just got home and I’m finally setting up my iPhone 15 Pro can’t wait to see what’s in store for me!
Arun bro ❤
I have the iPhone 14 Pro Max it’s not worth getting the 15  it only has a little bit of changes net worth the money right now. Plus the titanium is brushed on very little and it scratches really fast. How do you get a Sim injector when there’s no Sim card it’s E Sims
Waste of money iphone 13 14 15 same
they need larger sensors to gather more light.
Good
Same phone as last year. Surprise!
love seeing your fiacee in B-roll. great touch.
Day 45 Good day Arun Hope I get lucky with your giveaways here in Africa
the microphone modes have been there on the 14 pro max as well
I don’t think this guy’s heard of how fragile this phone is lol
I love your work brother keep it up. Yet ive seen on other reviews that its really fragile and with some pressure even inside ur pocket it can crack. I recently sold my 13 pro max and was going to buy to 15 now i am having doubts and really thinking about buying the 14 pro max instead what do you think ?
Give me One !!! I’ll pray for you to get mor sub the apple!!!❤ Atleast gimme as the a huge fan
How much of those camera features are hardware based?
The newly-released iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max are suffering from overheating issues, according to owners. The flagship Apple phones are reportedly reaching temperatures as high as 47C, with some users claiming that the handsets become too hot to touch while not using a case. Seems because of the use of Titanium for the case
I love it the wallpapers at 17:33, how can i get those. Please drop the link. Thank U! <3
Somone need tell him his flashlight 🔦 is on 😂😂😂
Come on Apple your game is weak, IPhone 15 Titanium is nothing but a marketing gimmick. You want to impress us, how about a Platinum or 18-24k gold phone for the prices you’re charging. A titanium case doesn’t do nothing that that the aluminum iPhone provided. Most people are not that stupid to fall for the hype.
We need Apple Watch series 9 review>>>>BUTTON PLEASE
We need the voice isolating for the AirPods Pro! They are horrible when it comes to phonecalls in noisy environments…
Please talk about the thermal throttling issue and easy breakable glass on 15 pro series !
But you said you will make a phone company
iPhone 15 has same camera as 14
Super i phone 15 super
👍
'Better than you think' 🤣🤣🤣
But does it make phone calls?
Excellent technicality too  zoom in too reality man !!!!! 😂
I got the 14 Pro Max a few months ago. I think I’ll be alright for the next couple of years lol the 15 isn’t really worth the price tag to me 🤷🏽‍♂️
3:01 I just saw someone on Twitter use the action button to unlock their Tesla.
You are such a disappointment, my friend. You made me brought this trash. Perhaps putting a durability test for a phone review would be wise.
Great review, really thorough
Well not to be that guy but you can pretty much play any console or pc games that are on geforce now from your phone, if you have a good internet speed. I don't know if Iphone uses the same system as GeforceNow (didn't finish the video) but if it does, it's nothing new.
ineed this wallpaper please
Why is every person Testing the new iPhone telling about poor build quality and overheating, but you haven’t mentioned it? Are you payed by Apple?
You are video it's very good
Back tap feature ??????!!!
I went from a regular 11 to the 15PM. It’s an amazing device, absolutely no regrets. 👌
So nice
Im left handed and the action button gives me no issue.  Your statement of uncomfortabiliy only leans towards right handers .
Bend that max pro, its trash
Too many lie
It's certainly a paid review
Try the Backbone controller. It's so much nicer than having a separated controller.
So summary of the video is don’t upgrade unless you have an iPhone X aka iPhone 10. You might as well wait to see what iPhone 16 has to offer 😏 this is a iPhone 14 at best with very very minor upgrades…
I'm also eating apple 🍎 and watching this video 😂
DONT SWITCH PLEASE IT'L BREAK
Still cracks though ✌️
I just want a blue phone
11 pro max is my favourite, so far
all that money and they give a standard cable? You know they're laughing at the consumer, right?
yes
Lagging on genshin 😂
Apple is getting worse and worse with design nothing like new side iphone 12!!!!  plus you have removed the best rims such as gold color and glossy frame which hears that the mobile looks luxurious unfortunately I am happy to switch to Samsung after I have been iphone fans for over 10 years the new iphone 15 is boring color and matte finish makes them look cheaper and like it's not finished in detail
When you realize that volume buttons ara next to the action button and already using as a shutter button for camera 😂🔫
I need that wallpaper from the thumbnail haha
300hz displays with sapphire. Satellite full data transmission for everything no cellular soloing, double the wireless charging speed. Next iPhone 👍👍👍
Unboxing it rn :D
iPhone CLAIMS that they can play 720p console games then do a game test playing genshin impact for 2 hours straight then check the temperature... that's how you test a performance of a phone... with that price and claims you should know how to speak when you should... this review is more on camera focus... i guess... 😅😅😅
Cleverly he avoided overheating issue wonder this big youtubers are hiding everything
Just go buy the Samsung. Than you wont hate yourself ☺️
Sad
Worth less phone in ever... 🤦🏻‍♂️
How about overheating?
The price difference is actually $200, not $100.
Great review!   I must be crazy because I prefer the squared design updates introduced with the 12 and I also love the 15 pro max’s but I did not like the X / 11’s rounded design
prices are mad in Australia. $1,849 for the 15 pro and $2,199 for the pro max-
Dam this review was fantastic.
Sadly when you played Genshin, phone stutters and gets hot as a MF
My man, you are the best iPhone reviewer out there. Just discovered your channel and now I don’t bother with other channels
Why is Arun elevating the new iPhone so much when there is almost no change
Congratulations! You bought the same phone again. Still a great review.
Had it for a few days now coming from iPhone pro 13. Nice but Unimpressed overall. Im going to return and save my money
I’m not sure about buying 1, lots of video leaks about the huge problem of iphone 15 pro and pro max
Where Can i get that wallpaper?
Bluds are trying to save ihpone 15.
Biggest disadvantages of the iphone 15 pro:   - no speed charging - no 8k video recordings and slow mo only 240fps - annoying notch - battery life didnt improved - not noticable performance difference with older iphones
Your video review is really nice, i liked it a lot! Giving you a follow! <3 cheers bro, keep creating ^_^
Paid to give a good review
The best iPhone yet 😅
Iphone 15 pros are lacking in build quality and they break in seconds. There are overheating issues too in 15 pro series. Better to go for 14 pro max. I cancelled my order for 15 pro max and I will now buy 14 pro max
You always on apple side, biased review.. Its too expensive, $300 phones got most of its features...
The I phone 15 pro is a terrible phone. It doesn’t charge in my brand new cars wireless charger because of the camera. Doesn’t work on other wireless chargers either. So you have to buy a power adapter for your usb c cord they provide you. Then if you want a wireless charger you have to buy that. If you want to charge your phone in your vehicle you have to buy another adapter for that. Unbelievable.
If Apple was able to put console games on the 15 Pro, that means they'd be able to put it on an updated version of the AppleTV, right.....?
Your idolatry towards apple becomes so evident in these reviews
Blackmagic Camera App, vertical Landscape Mode  and I'm left-handed, so the new action button is in the perfect place, but it doesn't help that Apple moves it to the right side
I don't know why people compare s22 ultra Samsung with iPhones. S22 ultra that I've been using lags, heats up immediately and crashes mostly. The phone is like a normal cheap phone with just better camera 📷
Hi, Would like to have your review on performance throttling issue on 15 pro max due to quick overheating. This is reported by several users across multiple platform.
Wait wait so now how many phones do you have
RE: The hard-to-reach buttons; seems like whoever is the product manager is left-handed.   As a lefty, everything is absolutely perfectly placed for me.
all it is a video game and camera.  big whooop.  make money, don't play video games, kids
Does it really have a sim ejector tool?? 😅
Can the cable transfer data or is it just for charging
How much storage does the pro have?
Why doesn't anyone using a Samsung in comparisons slide the shutter button to take continuous photos? Tap tap tap is stupid slow in comparison. You're supposed to use the continuous photo tech they built in.
Your review videos are the best 💯💯. I did this thing where I type your exact words in your reviews without making any chages or tweaks. Word for word just for the fun of it!!. Moving on to the Samsung comparison rai now!😅😅
All iphones are the same, like why lie. Nothing changes on these phones. Trust me ive been having iphones.
Nice one Arun! What about the durability of the phone? I've seen some videos circulating online about poor durability, especially the Pro Max version. What do you think about them? @Mrwhosetheboss
PLease show the iPhone 15's back glass shattering issues
60hz LOL
Took 9 years to get USB-C, Apple is too slow or too dumb? 🤔  Or  they think we are dumb 🧠
What an entertaining & informative video
Yo great video but weirdly white finger nails
Ive seen someone cracking the backglass using their thumbs . Is this true??? And it doesn’t withstand a simple droptest?
Love the way how fluid your analysis feels! Thanks for upping tech review standards for the world. Cheers!
Come and buy one
Awesome review man!!...are any of the 15s capable of any type of fast charging, with the appropriate cable/charger ??
9:38 to 11:00 has my favourite background music and can someone tell me what it’s called.
Absolutely love it, it's true, the more you use it, the more you love it ❤
Nice review but many say it isn’t much better than previous models..  easier to scratch, kill battery faster..
I was today years old when I learned about the back tap on my iPhone 12 pro
is there a way to control weather the cable is input or output/what phone will be getting charged first?
I stopped watching tech reviews for a some time, to now find out every tech YouTuber has switched to an iPhone 😂
WiFi 7 in oneplus
I’m just gonna use my old phone as a battery pack when I buy the 15😂
For something that’s titanium , the PVE coating is easily scratched,  the glass back is one of the worst ideas and now shatters upon any impact .  I don’t even know if a Mous case with its airo shock on the sides would protect the glass back, seems the screen is scratch resistant until level 6 any sharper then it scratches .     Overall , a fail iPhone …..    I reamember when the iPhone X came out and you put a mose case n dropped it from a. Helicopter ,   Do that again with the 15 pro max , it will not survive!   Apple made the back glass removable so they could increase profit to replace broken back easier for them. More expensive for us.    Titanium is not good for a smartphone . Only pro is the weight .    The internals are stilll stainless ,   Plus do you even know how much grade 5 titanium is ?   If they were to rlly use it all the phone on every metal it would cost over $2000 just for the titanium.  The titanium they are using is a thin layer no more than $200 worth. Should of kept the stainless , it don’t leave scratch marks as bad as that PVE coated titanium. @MrWhoseTheBoss
Good
@3:44 wow I thought this man was gay the entire time,   Wow, congratulations on the beautiful fiancé .   Extraordinarily wonderful Contant  love it 🎉
The real true is that there are way better smartphone out there .with open operations system.jyst because it's popular it's not a perfect phone.i know I use a android system in college now and for me iPhone it's just a fun phone android it's a smart phone period 😊
Okay, sold.
crazy idea. What if you took an iphone and spliced it into a PSP container. the emulation possibilities would be endless...
Congratulations Apple you have made the worst phone to date. iPhone 15, what a joke of a company latetly scamming their customers.
apple trying so hard to save their asses
Back tap BACK TAP
I am indeed impressed by the iPhone this year but a lot of their new bells and whistles aren't new. On top of the back glass showing to be potentially a weak point from JerryRigEverythings video and it costing around $200 non AC+ to replace. I'm kinda tired of the dog and pony show. I'm going to call a spade a spade and point out that the iPhone is boring and behind the competition hardware and software wise. Their comfortability in their market hype has made them soft with a bloated product line and a passive aggressive human rights track record That makes the devil blush. I REALLY want to see what this year's s24 Ultra and Pixel line up bring before I give the iPhone ANY adulation.  From my perspective, Steve is dead, the magic is gone and unless the iPhone truly outcompetes the market instead of the lazy complacent excuse of the "Apple ecosystem"  and how everything works better together when you buy into it...  I'm tired of this hardware pyramid scheme!   The iPhone 15 is a turd Simply a well-polished and marketed scam just like it's Apple! 😒 🪶🔥🎤🔥👺
Voice isolation mode was already a feature
Is this video sponsored?? Just an honest question. While this is a great device it has some serious flaws which you haven't mentioned. IE how fragile it is, the slow charging, and the sw limitations that apple still can't seem to sort out?
Apple paid this guy to promote there device
Apple should give an charging adapter as well
Wait.. if phones start to be able to run console games then you could just connect your controller to your phone and stream it to a TV. You could have a console in your pocket :D
I am interested in knowing the wallpaper he is using.
Can you show us how big is the loss on photos between 3x to 5x on the Pro Max vs the Pro and what that means in everyday life instances? Family time photos, indoor houses photos etc. Im not sure if 5x is used frequently unless you are on holiday!! Thanks man
Hi Arun. You forgot one more important thing that Iphone 15 pro has above the competition. It keeps your body and hands warm in the upcoming winter due to it's new built in feature: overheating 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Thanks for not mentioning this 😂😂😂😂😂😂
how much did apple pay you for this😹
I love that you use military time
iPhone wallpaper please
The girl says it’s so loud you I can barely hear myself with some simple water running
surely you're the only person who rotates the phone for landscape photos with the lenses at the bottom??
👍
The amount of money people wasted to buy a new phone each year for a better camera they could have just bought a great actual camera lol
the defining feature was the usb-c
eweryone agrees to its not wort it. like old Sonnys camera button and Samsungs bixby button if you putted after5 years in ıphone,you cant call it as upgrade. as an usb-C also. like  Saruman says: ''You are a lesser son of greater sires'' dear ı phone 15 series and watch ultra2
Boss becomes Fanboy of apple
bro was using his cat as a phone stand 💀
@17:59  source : Marquez brownlee
Your Review was best of the ones I saw and I found it   1.Unbiased and positive 2.Focused on Upgrades and Capabilities  3.Also enlightened on limitations   Rarely I've seen such review. Even maestros giving review sometimes it feels that they would have demanded something which they didn't get eventually hold a grudge and trying to influence user's perception with their negativity.  I have a question here please help: Does iphone 15 Pro 77mm lens produce better result compared to 77 on 15 Pro max because of crop of 5X being functional ?
for android users it's a joke.
Lol the "dynamic island" is just a giant notification bar that doesn't goaway 😅
Why do reviewers dedicate time to talk about the sides? 99% of the buyers will just slap a case on it.
I want the 15 but this phone feels like they perfected this design. They always move to a different design when they perfect a design. I have the 13 pro max and I’m still loving it. I think the 16 will the one to get.
titanium does not feel as premium as stainless steel. A downgrade to me.
Something goes wrong with 15 Pro max please test it . Again it's band like iPhone 6 on back side please make a about truth I believe you 😢😢😢😢😢
14 pro and 15 pro are the same
14 pro and 15 pro are the same
However 15 Pro's battery life is not good.
Great video to watch. Next month I will get iPhone 15 Pro Max. It will be my first smartphone.
8:22
seeing ur video after jerryrig video, u look like a joker to me ! 🥺🥺🥺🥺 u r the only one i trusted ! but now ?
Eehhh its ok. Not worth the upgrade from where I'm coming from.
Got my navy color version pro yesterday with 256GB
You can already push the volume buttons for taking pictures so the action button doesn’t really change anything
I got my kidney ready.
Hi may I ask which is better getting the 15 pro or pro max
Ummm the volume buttons already function as a shutter button since forever
Is there a link for the purple wallpaper?
Lol this review differs very much from Mkbhd initial impressions on his podcast. Waveform Podcast broke down the camera system claiming there's not too much improvement and decrease in battery life. Whostheboss is not representing that in any of the reviews and there's been very little critique. I'm not saying he's biased but...  maybe
These days your content started feeling like you are making it just for the sake of making it.
I miss those day when audio was given much attention on a smart phone. Now it's all about camara....Shame
One of the best reviewers. Many Thanks 👍😊
The volume buttons on an iPhone, actually are the shutter buttons as well.  So if you put your phone in landscape mode, you can use the volume up or volume down button and that’ll take the photo.
When the camera reaches 100 mp it will be better but as usual pimps will talk and lot of donkeys make like and go to purchase
Can't wait the iPhone that can be connected to big screen and run MacOS with mouse and keyboard support
very nice❤❤
Watching on my 14 pro and will wait for 16 pro for upgrade 😅😅😅
CALL QUALITY!!! You absolute legend! I’ve been waiting for reviewers to test this for years! I always have to go into the store and test it myself! Brilliant!
Loved the review. Hated the lighting.
👍🏻
Wallpaper in thumbnail?
Can’t wait for Skyrim IPhone edition!
typical apple fanboy
Tbh 720p gaming is more than enough for handheld considering it is a handheld where battery matters. When we get switch 2, I hope we can tweak the graphic option ourselves and turn down the resolution to 720p (even after fsr or dlss). i prefer having stable 720p60 rather than higher graphic settings unless i put the nintendo switch on the dock where battery doesn't matter. then yes I want to play 4k60 if possible (idt switch 2 will be capable running 4k60 on docked mode tho, let's see).
That camera thing is very Sony Xperia Thing 😂
Bro u r just an iPhone fan.. waste of time to see your reviews. Apple barely adds anything to its new generations and u fans give reviews on top of it.
I used to admire you ,been following you for a long time ,lately it feels like meh , you know what keep printing money imma unsubscribe .
there’s no reason to get this phone lol
Need wallpaper
Seems like the action button is at a weird orientation for the camera as well
So finally apple have decided to pay these rascals a much higher amount to initiate sales by promoting their product And these Fake youtuebrs also do the same.
can it take a picture of the moon, yet?
LATEST TECHNOLOGY WOW
Give me one phone sir,  Im from sri lanka.❤❤❤❤
Where can i get that wallpaper….
What wallpaper is that your using?
Stop glazing it
Wallpaper link please?
The evolution of smartphone notches has been quite interesting over the years. iPhones introduced the concept of notches, setting a trend that Android devices quickly followed. However, Android took it a step further, refining the design by making the notches smaller and introducing innovative variations like the tear-drop notch and punch-hole camera displays. Interestingly, Apple chose not to directly copy Android's advancements and stuck with their notch design for a while. To cover up, they introduced a feature that some critics argue was more of a gimmick than an innovation: the "dynamic island," which, when you think about it, is essentially a stretched-out pattern resembling a punch-hole camera. iphone never want to accept defeat and come up with bullshit stuff to keeps the fools occupied for a couple of years, literally any android phone can have a dynamic island anywhere on their screen 😂
Was not interested in 15 series until...
Still love my iPhone 13 Pro Max!
Where can I get that wallpaper?
Apple fanboy...
Why don't you compare the iphone 15 vs iPhone 14 and tells us if the transition worth it?
Iphone problem.... the phone when you use it's always hot.... specialty you play games.... the phone is very hot...iphone is not good
Milo also can become a phone holder/stand
Game name u were playing in the video pls
Remember  . King is always king .samsung  good camara new technologies.  Iphone only boring peple use. Samsung  always king.    Exploring peple always use samsung  flagship phone .
S23 ultra always 🤴 king. Future  .I phone only  Old Future  . Old concept. 😂king is always king . S23 ultra. Fold 5. Z filp more options  for a life . Think more . Samsung  king
So their new marketing strategy is to make people expect less and give them a little more to feel satisfied 😂
Amazing review
Me with an iPhone 8: 👀
No no, Its garbage. Nothings changed
Great video, love your style and approach. 15 is my first ever iPhone and I like it and after coming from the s series ultra, it has a lot to live up to. USB c clinched my move over in the end
Where can we find the wallpaper?????
Thanks for another great video!  Wondering which pro you would recommend for an influencer who uses their iPhone for most of content production?
I wish i had  a iphone 15 pro max(its worth hundreds of thousands in my country😮😂❤)
Me watching with my Motorola e22
Consumerism at its peak. People who keep falling to buy the newest tech really have lost their purpose to live.
oh my god a camera button on the top right of the device, NO OTHER COMPANY EVER DID THIS BEFORE INT HE HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
7272 multi core score is amazing, and not because it may summon a relatively small yet persistent game community, but because its good. Yep. That's why.
The phone looks tubby
That Wallpaper is sick! Anybody got a tip on where I can download it? haha
This type advertising is hard to watch
Could you please recommend a USB-C cable for iPhone 15 pro, which supports USB 3?
Moon shot on iPhone 15 pro vs Samsung😊please
Im getting iphone 15 pro max and i love it the titanium looks good😊
Gr8 video Arun bhai..Jai Shree Rama 🙏
"The back tap feature, which all iPhones have..." *Cries in iPhone 8* EDIT: nvm, the iPhone 8 has it too.
How did I never know about the back tap feature on my phone for the past 7 years. I just tried it and it’s already my favourite feature lol😂
and what a surprise usb-c but you have to buy a brick to charge it, nice one.  Ok apple had to change to usb-c but knowing that it wasn't compatible with 14,13,12 and so on hey didn't put a charger in.  and for me this WE ARE SAVING THE PLANET' is all BS
Ok Apple shill
for me i have the iphone 12 pro max pacific blue color. or i can wait for the iphone 16 pro max or the iphone 17 pro series. coming in 1 to 3 years and maybe a full screen/ display. and also thin bezels for the iphone series. is it worth it to upgrade to the iphone 15 series with usb-c ports cable. or also a good gaming phone for a decent price.
if u have any old phone that works properly send it to me cant afford any
Who cares all these are a waste of money . If no one went and bought the phone guaranteed you would truly get a state of the art phone . Rip off trash people will spend more money on this trash then some people make all year to live .
The iPhone 15: Looks exactly the same, slightly better, more expensive  yay?
2:20 Meanwhile, on any ANDROID phone: double click the power opens camera, volume up OR down, takes a picture. FOR YEARS! But, wow, Apple!
Tbh I think iPhone 15s are worth it
Still running to 12 Pro Max no plans to upgrade yet
Can I have a link to download the wallpaper?🤞
Its back glass is breaking like matchstick.
Oh, the impossible task of saying anything bad about an Apple product! (other than risking ruining your algorithm). Hope you are not following by the MKBHD book and going the iVerge path. Check the amazing review of the last Beats (awful) headphones and you will see how Marques was incapable of saying anything bad. On a product that is worth 1/5 of his price tag.
Wow iphone 15 lessss go
I've read the comments. It's clear the focus is on the reviewer and not the phone. May be people are not impressed with the upgrade. Me too and thats why I wont be upgrading this time...i could be wrong
Alot of people might have missed it but the Sony Xperia Z1/2 also had an action button for the camera. But if we were to compare it to the previous Iphones, yea it's a something "New"
Amazing ! I like this video .The battle is becoming more of software one than hardware  is a great job 👍
The usb c port is so cool. All my other Apple devices use that so now I only need to take 1 cable with me. Other brands have already startes copying Apple. Saw just yesterday that my friends Android has usb c 😂
Not enough to warrant an upgrade in my opinion. I’ll stick with my 14 pro. I watched a video with the camera comparison and its not worth it. Going back to the 12pro videos, then watching the 15pro videos. The iphone pro has gotten a-lot better. The cameras I find quite odd.  As all the way from I-Justine’s I-phone 11 video the photos look amazing, and every year after. But in real world use the photos aren’t like that.   The iPhone 12 regular takes awful photos from experience. I dont remember if it was from the ios version but omg, I remember low light settings it would make me line up shots if it thought it was to dark.  The 13 was a big improvement & brought the most noticeable upgrades I saw. The 14 pro has alot of nice features along with the 15 line up. But it doesn’t matter one thing people do no mention is you must be super still to get that amazing shot.  You never see real reviews for awhile. Like people trading down from 14Pros to 13 minis.  Since the 11Pro it feels as if the 15Pros are the completed version of this design variant.  Next year needs to be a different design, add themes, use the actual power of the phones chips for better version of ios.  I still feel like ive had the same iPhone since the XR. Its time for apple to actually change the design of the iphone.  The cameras would be a great start in the top middle of the back. Add touch id to the home button. Full screen display. Make a better camera app. Allow us to put more on the lock screen.  Its not the iphones I have disliked so much the past years. Its ios holding the phones back from having to keep older devices alive. I always say this until we get to say goodbye to the A12 chip in the iphones, we wont see a real new version of ios.  Iphone 14pro & 15pros should have different camera apps to support the pro cameras better. Nos theres a pro chip I expect the pro to bring more to ios.
It seems like your skin is greasy or that you're sweating almost. Also, the music is very distracting because it's too fast or rather busy. Smoother beats and lower pitched melodies are less distracting.
Do people not know the difference between Matte and Satin finish?
Sony had such button for yearssssss but still no one appreciated it. Apple copied the same the thing and whole world is amazed woth it 😂😂😂😂😂 hypocrisy at its best 😂😂😂
S23 ultra still BETTER
I was hoping for a redesign on the 15 . I have the xs max looking at the pro max, should I hold out?
Can somebody send the link to download that wallpaper please
He is from the Bronx
I’ll stick with my 13 pro max it’s the same shit yall can’t be this obsessed with a phone
Is the same phone
Is it worth upgrading from the iPhone 14 pro max
too much of an Apple fan boy some of the highlighted camera specs (by the way you give emphasis) are already existing on older phones (1-2 years ago) maybe the main highlight of that model is GAMING which includes Ray Tracing tech and DLSS, which will still not be available in newly released mobile games 2-3 years from now so its basically useless as of now why would someone spend $2000 on a mobile to do gaming, if u can spend it on a console or PC set just for the sake of gaming and with much better gaming experience
USB-C, the single biggest feature. Finally, Apple smartened the fuck up, even though they fought back against it.
How do I have voice isolation on my 11 pro for 1 year already????
Can anyone help with where to find the wallpapers used?? I really like em
What is the wallpaper?
Hey I like how you made the same kind of video for the S22 ultra and S23 ultra lol
can you get me a iphone 14 pro max deep purple please
Wallpaper?
Walpaper names plisss
Well you were honest but now i dont really trust your content 😊
Bro is defending a greedy company. The funny thing is: Android and other os could do the same thing as iphone 15. Its weird how people are still buying Thier expensive as hell phones, albeit with a phone that literally has little to different to the previous one now.....maybe people keep buying because of this man.
Where can i find his wallpaper ?
Your reviews are incredibly professional, a total masterpiece here. Thanks for producing such a high quality experience for your viewers!!
Just ordered the iphone 15 pro last iPhone i had was the 12 pro do people think i am going to notice a different
Getting my 15 pro today, can’t wait to see the difference from my current iPhone 11 I’ve used for 4 years
if apple keeps this up we will have consoles built into our phone that be used anywhere and any time which would be insane cause we could plug a HDMI mouse / keyboard or a controller and have a console anywhere any time which would then means that we can all have lets say spiderman 2 on the go max settings which would be so dope
If I have that money I would buy poco and the Car, not this phone
Why are your videos so boring to watch these days?
Stop misusing the term Review. This is more of an infomercial not a review. Just reading all the detailed specs, and telling how this generation is better than ever is similar to what Apple does during their launch events. No cons, no comparison from competition, not even telling your subscribers wheather this is actually worth the upgrade or just another minor spec bump.   When you made that video about transparency and honesty. I thought you were being genuine, now this video shows you are just like other reviewers who would make a positive review for companies. Guess I'll stick to Mr Mobile from now onwards.
Wallpaper from?
Its just another iphone that is slightly faster, has a better camera and finally a usb c port lmao
Good review of stuff other phones had for years. 😂 Iphone 15 is the biggest kick in the b@lls from apple  to every  fan 😂😂
bro. I GOT A IPHONE 15 AD BEFORE THE VID OMG
Where u get this wallpaper???
Frame copied from NOTHING Phone 2 and TYPE-C forced by EU - nothing special
So you r suggesting to buy 15 just because of button 😂 paid lie 😅
At around 15 24 the flash was on
8:49 Oxford Street
Also, 999 up by a hundred is not 1199... Sorry to be the one to spoil it :)
bro, you presented their phone way better than aplle themselves. I hope they apprechiate it adequately.
1500€ software upgrade
You could always use the volume button to snap pics in landscape... I still can't believe a button is a chat
Still unrepairable uverpriced crap.
Dude stop hyping the same iPhone
чо так лайків мало?
I don't think it is better than expect
$1300 for the same phone 😅
Battery Drian And Charging Test Video ? ? brother? Apple 15, 15 Pro
Better advertising than Apples entire marketting team...
really happy with my order of a 15 pro then
Just saying that my base s22 can already go to camera by 2x tapping the power button and photos with vilume button
Are you planning on reviewing soms huawei or honor device?
Voice Isolation is also there on older iPhones.
Amazing! Its on the same level as phones from 4 years ago!
so what cable do i need???
So nothing new
nice
Less than 30 sec. Mr Bean appears! 😂 Thank you!
@Mrwhosetheboss do you want to giveaway your old iPhone 14 pro max😅
I can bet this phone is nothing less then garbage. wait for price drop
Standard features on an android become talk of the town among apple users😂
If your a type of guy that buy new iphone every year then your the type that desires to have a ALMOST same experience, the iphone only add the things that are important for better experience and they will only make same speed improvements like 10% or 20% better chip or camera. Like this if your that type of guy 👍👍
Does anyone else miss the MrWhosTheBoss outro music?
so i will buy a $1799 phone for resident evil game? :D
People are madly status about iphone
to think phones have come as far as being more powerful than most laptops from 2018 or previous is crazy. especially knowing when smartphones originally started they were more powerful than the IBM computers in nasa from the 60’s. i feel soon phones will be powerful enough to run most things a decently powerful computer can. including AAA games at 1080p or even 1440p 60fps+. and be able to efficiently render images/videos. still probably a decade away but still crazy to think it may be possible with how much performance jumps year to year with seemingly no halt or limits.
I have never got an i phone . Whenever I go to the apple store I look at the phones, determined to get it one day.😊
This is the cutest video ever Arrun made. I loved it so much since this is the first time I saw Milo support the work and cooperate willingly. Hahahaah so cute and adorable Milo
3:15 this has been a feature since at least the last ios update btw
Just admit it Arun, it got nothing new other than USB-C. Same old pathetic crap of non-sense. I live in Gulf where 90% of local bought Apple, this trend changed alot for last 2 years.
Nice
He needs to be invited apple events, and given phones before public.. As expected..
Kindly explain the 200mp n 24 mp for sumsang n iphone, since as the difference in pic quality is not as huge
Voice isolation was on the 14 pro max too
awesome video
My best advice for you is to know how much storage space you used on your old Apple before you decide on the Pro model
I work for a telecommunications supplier, I had the chance to do small tests this afternoon. From my point of view I wouldn’t go on the 15 pro 128GB, because the system already takes 69GB 😢
Got my pro max today - completely forgettable. Don’t waste your money people.
I need the download link to that iPhone wallpaper
Wow wow 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😮
🤦‍♂
There is a problem with these type of review because it is already based on a bias. Mrwhosetheboss, marques brown lee, and even instagram reviewers like Jerometraveller (in your previous video in Apple showroom I saw) all were invited to the Apple event. So it's common sense to say that, those who were invited to be a part of the unveil at Apple won't say anything bad about it. Because if you do, then apple would not take it as a friendly gesture and you may not get an invite for the next apple event.  If I were completely honest, all these new features could have been updates to the 14 pro. Simple. The similarities to the predecessor outweigh the differences and for that, you should ridicule apple in this case if the reviewer were fare. Because if oneplus, motorola, sony, or any other phone maker who has minimal upgraded phones from their predecessor would be slammed by top reviewers. but Mrwhosetheboss, MKBHD, iJustine and people who were invited to the apple event won't say a shred of new publicity.  If you want unbiased reviews, look at the reviewers who did not go to the apple event to cover the iphone 15.
why you always jumping?? lol
Hasn't Samsung had the motion photo and space saving format for awhile now
If u zoom out 13,14,15 u can forget the difference.. N wow USB cbcz of EU pressure. Now all this youtubers are getting paid by the big companies like Samsung and Apple. They would always say perfect . Better than before all such captions .
What’s that wallpaper
Me thinks this is a wait for the 16, not enough changes 😅
You gotta respect the work @Mrwhosetheboss does on these videos. In all honesty I think he does a better job than apple 😅
Last years iphone with a better camera lol
I’m calling cap the type c port was a major deal at least for me I absolutely hated apples absolutely shit charger, lightning cable more like pos cable, I literally waited 5 years and have refused to upgrade until they changed charger ports because I hated the lightning cable so much as soon as I heard type c cable I pre ordered the 15 pro max get mine the 29th but literally hated the lightning cable that much there chargers constantly broke and I put up with a broken phone for the past 3 years because I refused to upgrade until they changed there dogshit port
...he's a shill
The native AAA gaming feature is nice, but it is matter of time before android catches up, because android is much more open operating system, and also, I play pc games at 1080p 60fps on my phone which is a potato phone, you just need to have fast wifi connection, and own game from epic, steam... yep I'm talking about nvidia GeForce now, also I am thousands of kilometres away from their servers, so I first connect to their servers with VPN and turn it off once the session starts, so I have okay-ish 10-15ms input lag, but I play games for fun so it is okay....
Every second of his videos are worth watching!  Absolutely incredible Youtuber! No bullshit Intro, no unnecessary drama, all productive content!  So glad to have found him here!  He is my Go-to person for any tech related content esp knowing that I am not too tech savvy but being assured that I will learn a lot whenever I click his videos! 💯🙌🏻
I'm on a 12 right now and not sure really if it's worth upgrading I mean there are most def upgraded features from my current phone but I'm just really not sure if it'll be worth some people let me know as I haven't seen much for comparisons on these two.
where did you get that awesome phone stand🥰😅
How fast we forget .....it's a phone ..the rest is extra ...
Dude is "reaching" with the title and content for clicks man. Am I saying it's a bad phone? No.. But let's not pretend this is some revelation. Literally watch everyone else's review that's reputable and take off your rose tinted glasses. Ain't no one saying "its better than you think". Come on bruh.
7 lens camera or 120 mm is laughable. Just Apple marketing lie.
how much did apple paid him for this?
What a great video. Well done dude. You really articulate it well.
I tried finding the wallpaper for the iPhone from the video add. Tried doing reverse image search with no luck. The image with the purple burst colors. Any ideas?
This guy is an IPhone Fanboy!
❤
I get that the reviewers are paid, but being biased on this level, this is desinfromation
Okay but the frames are made of recycled aluminium in iphone 15 pro and in iphone 14 pro they are made of stainless steel therefore ip14pro is still more durable than ip15pro even tho it has no titanium back, so shouldn't mid-frames also be made of titanium?
iphone 15 smell like spices
Where did you get that iPhone wallpaper?
I’m left handed but I use my left hand to control my phone so if I had the 15 pro the action button would be in reach for me
Do another battery lasting video on the new iPhones pleasee
Bro you cant play ANY emulated games using emulators from old systems on an iphone. Until iOS gets emulators, any apple device is miles behind other android smartphones
Taking photos to cats is actually the intended way to use cameras. Nice reviews!
I’m watching this on my new iPhone 15pro. 😉
Hey @Mrwhosetheboss, please please share the beautiful 15 pro max wallpaper with us!!
Anyone else watching this on a 3 year old plus iPhone Because u can’t afford the 15?💀💀
I thought Mr whostheboss was gay
Iphone 15 cutie✨🫶🏼
Finger prints don't bother me
Same phone different year😂
Don't believe the hype.
PS4 supports HDR, you don't need a PS5 for that...  And about the games, well Apple surely shines when Devs optimize something for it cause it's all private proprietary both hardware and software by Apple, BUT there's a huge difference to the PC version all at ultra 4K to whatever the game is running at and at 720P in it, so the performance is not there out of the sudden to just play all PS5 games or something like that as they would have to be reduced massively to run well...
Love that you’re propping your phone up on your cat. I do that too 😂 I also preordered my 15 Pro the other day. I’m super excited, considering I’m upgrading from iPhone 11.
it is far cheaper to get in a phone contract rather than just buying the phone.
do the battery test on all iphone 15 phones. pleaseeeeeeeeeee
Oh bullcrap
Great review! I have my new 15 pro max in hand and its amazing. I also might have missed it in your review, but the added repairability of the glass on the back was also a nice addition.
Where can i get his purple wallpaper?
Samsung > Iphone this will never change
Such good videos on this channel! Thank you!
MWTB > MKBHD.
Thank you for saying all of this at the end because I have the 14 pro max and all I kept hearing you do was compare the 14 pro to the 15 pro max which was irritating. I’m still going to get the 15 pro max due to the charger since I have the iPad and I’m on the jump program so it won’t cost much of anything to trade but the slight difference in the camera is not worth it.
can i plaes get you'res iphone 14
Hard to believe that still will be people who will wait in the lines to get one.....
What is the wallpaper he’s using?
im good  with  TECNO  or   INFINIX.     150USD
Wait until snap 8gen 3 comes
Sponsored 💔
❤tolles video
wait iphone 15 is out already??
There is no changes 😂
رائع جدا ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Can i use 35w charger on iphone 15pro
Imagine if you’re just chilling on a plane and a guy next to you is playing Zelda TOTK on a phone 🤯
Rounded corners on displays still look terrible...
can i use tempered glass for 14 pro to 15 pro?
If the iPhone 15 can run Resident Evil Village at 720p 30fps, I see no reason why future iPhones and future Galaxy phones wouldn't be able to use tech like Valve's Proton translation layer to run Windows games. The Steam Deck isn't that much more powerful than the iPhone 15 Pro or Android phones running the 8 gen 2. Also note at 9:40, a ton of Android phones have been licensing HEIF from Apple for a few years now, and HEIF is nothing new even on iPhones. I'm also really excited to see the industry copy the "after-the-fact" portrait mode feature, despite it being a Google Photos feature for many years now. It's nice to see these things built into camera and photos apps that come with phones and just having these things available by default.
I LOVE epidemic sound!  I use them as well!
I was thinking to buy it but after saw it this video, maybe I pass, is expensive too! I have iPhone 11 pro. I was thinking to buy this new iphone 15 pro in white maybe free fingerprint , maybe next year is dropping my iPhone from the list to getting ios 18!
Wait.... why not just by default add that isolation mode thing on the call?? Why bring it as a setting to turn on or off?
half the video was aboout the camera
If you choose different action to that button like camera, how can you put the iPhone in silent mode?
you really went into the camera feature… it was too geeky
Can I get a 15 pro as give away
Please share the wallpaper's link.
Man can sell iphones better than the company itself. Video is 🔥🔥🔥
14:01 No that continuous thousand lens zoom would be just  digital zoom. Apple has modeled the 1.2x and 1.5x using the same technique  as they have figured out the 2x which is the next best thing to an optical zoom using that "quad bayer / pixel"  main sensor .
0:00 : Intro 0:46 : Unboxing 1:03  : Charging Cable 1:25  : Action Button 3:09 : Voice Isolation with calls  4:10  : Performance 6:50 :  Design 8:36 : Cameras 16:03: Upcoming video hint 16:20 : Battery and charging 18:28 : Cost  19:23  : Outro
Voice isolation has been on the iphone and IOS for years!  Mr Boss is recycling old features is his videos just like Apple is with their keynotes, to inflate his content with watch time fillers
Trying to convince my dad to buy this (15 pro global  ) one instead of the 14 pro
👨🏿‍💻🍿
Yeah i still like iphone 14pro
After 1 month : Arun come with another video-> iPhone 15 not that great than you think ! I have a question, do you really think normal iPhone users care about Type C, Customised Buttons or noise cancellation 😂😂😂 iPhone is a status symbol!  And definitely the best camera phone. But whatever you said is just a sponsored scripts😂😂😂 I love iPhone , I am using one and I don’t care about whether it is lightning port or anything, whether it is noise cancellation enabled or unable. I care about the picture quality and data security
Camera button Sony done it for ages
You are such an apple fanboy, apple does anything you will be like WOW
Give me your old Iphone🥺🥺🧸
He z the best youtuber🎉
Good video. The iPhone 15 Pro looks really cool. By the way, I love that middle class London accent. Very classy and pleasant to the ears haha. Are you from West London?
Thanks for this very thorough review it’s always appreciated!
we care only the pro max not prossssssssss
Can i have one? Itll be pretty cool
I-Phone closed system & NO Chargers.....is GARBAGE 🤣😂 Sorry, but i dont like been held HOSTAGE to one company & have to PAY for EVERY APP known to APPLE 🤣😂  ITS A BIG FAT PASS FROM ME!!!! NEVER EVER EVER WILL I BUY AN APPLE (sh)i(te)-phone!! No matter whar features they try tempt me to become their CASH COW VICTIM!! The End.
I just swapped to the 15 pro from the 14 pro max and can't wait to fully test it out
It's amazing how well these videos flow and how crisply they're edited and presented! This review runs almost 20 minutes which is about the length of a sticom episode, but far more engaging.
Thank you for this video review, your style, performance, and expertise are top notch, one of the best review videos I’ve ever seen for any product. Glad I stumbled upon this…I am now a new subscriber!
Dude you better than MKBHD
I gonna buy this
Hawawi is the best 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
Voice isolation is old it’s been here since the 12
Only apple will make it a feature to be able to program buttons to your liking... android had this for more than 10 years ...🤦
The voice Isolation feature is not new. Maybe it is new to you @Mrwhosetheboss. I have used that in my iPhone 11 Pro Max for 2 years.
Voice isolation was in the last update before 17 I have it in my iPhone 13 Pro Max
iPhone users excited about finally having something to use their processing power on is hilarious! Android users are casually playing PS2, PSP, and even switch games on their phones. I really hope the 3rd party stores begin to change that for Apple users
I have iPhone 15 pro
2.20  Sony: Did you just Imitate me?
WAIT BUT MY IPHONE 11 HAS VOICE ISOLATION
Bro is flexing his girlfriend in his tech channel😢
So they didn’t include a pro cable with the pro phone and the action button is in a terrible location.
Not worth upgrading.
It's nothing new could be done with an update... - the cable is no upgrade srsly it is slow - you got paid from apple for speaking for apple good stuff..
WiFi 6e is not merely a less congested version of WiFi 6. WiFi 6 is a standard for 2.4 and 5ghz frequencies. WiFi 6e is using a completely different spectrum; the 6ghz spectrum. This allows for speeds and bandwidth that are unattainable in the 2.4 or 5ghz spectrum.
Excellent video but boring device :(
I really think everyone needs to complain more about Apple not giving a cube for the charger …. That’s flat out ridiculous
its sad arun won't make a video about the next S samsung series becuase apparently samsung is for the "poor".
That background noise feature WOW that worked great. That maybe the reason i finally get an iPhone
I thought I been in a classroom for 19 minutes.. learned
Nobody mentioned that you don’t need a camera adaptor to connect to a DAC using usb C to usb B connection. It should def sound better than using a shit adaptor from Apple that does not work frequently, I already had 6.
Good Explaining videos
i watch this and cannot wait for buy.
Did they restore the ‘select all’ feature while trying to copy that they took away?
First time seeing your vid! Feels like I'm watching a movie!
I boughgt a blue 15 pro max
Soon as the review starts off with him explaning they added a button, and what can it do for 2 minutes, and how amazingly iphone thought of adding a button and going in details about the button positions, rly sets the expectations high.
Where can i download those wallpapers like the purple one?
Watching on my all new Iphone 7.
better than you think? hahahahahaha! nice one.
apple's payroll
These kinda videos are annoying. Big fonts, flashes every few seconds and whats up with those transitions..
👍👍👍
In the poor lighting, odd angles, mechanical, electrical, and chemical images I often take with my 14 pro, the photos are massively over processed to the point of often being useless. My old non pro 12 took much much better pictures (if what I’m usually shooting) compared to my 14pro. I’m hoping this over processing has been fixed on the 15pro.
NOTCH FROM 2015 LOL!!
I don't understand why people keep the shutter time very less, you could keep a few seconds more to be completely seated for starting the actual video. It is just a few seconds, all it takes to avoid rushed seating at the start of the video.
Another Apple agent
Can't afford ... Though watching
PLEASE, stop lying people making these videos praising a product that you know is not worth what you say
I have the iPhone 11 and had no idea it had a back tap feature until you mentioned it. Wow.
No one talks about iphone 15  and. 2,0 port is super slow
What a BS! Nothing changed! Fixing bugs and correcting mistakes aren’t new product!
I’m the boss 😎
how much get from Apple???
Voice isolation is old as an iPhone feature. It’s been on the 13 pro max for for a while
I’ve never in my life heard about the double tap on the back of the phone.
lol I was kind of having remorse that i got a 14 pro 1 month before the launch. But seeing the launch event, I’m not feeling any remorse now. It’s so similar to 14 pro and the new things are things which I don’t care about. USB C is cool but I already have lightning cables with me and me and my wife both have iPhones so I really am not bothered by not having it considering that Apple has not improved charging speeds and I don’t do much data transfer using a cable these days.  All I wanted with an iPhone was 120hz display which is what made my upgrade from iPhone 12 to 14pro. I don’t see myself getting a new phone in the next 3-4 years. 14 pro is a beast.
Can i have the 11 pro or 14🥹 since you done with it
Where can I get this wallpaper?
Hi I'm from South Africa. I really love your videos. I have never owned an iPhone before which is extremely sad. Pl send me one 😢
Can someone tell me whether the better or more useful camera is in the 15 pro or 15 pro max? Such an actual photo comparison would be useful
How did you already get it? I preordered it and it gets delivered on the 12 October :/
That voice isolation is on me iPhone 13 Pro Max. It’s not exclusive to the new iPhone
the voice isolation has been on my iphone 14 pro max since day 1. whaddyamean new feature?
Qué gran día es para mí, el momento en que clagmac hizo un trabajo genial al arreglar mi iPhone 14 15 deshabilitado en Insta sin perder ningún dato.
Upgrading from my X  Cant wait!!!!!
The HEIF info was a bit wrong.  Samsung has HEIF as an option as well
Could you please also specify that this video is sponsored by Apple? That help for the viewers to have a clear picture exactly what you are saying and doing.
wait, in the camera, what do the volume buttons do?  So android had double tap to open camera, and volume for shutter for a decade....and apple not gets a kind of poor mans immitation?
Tell me you are overinvested in Apple stock without telling me you are overinvested.
Total nerd request, can you include photos of trains in your camera comparisons?
Lies and lies
forgot to mention : this video is sponsored by apple 🙂
The classic apple phrase “best iPhone reviewed yet” doesn’t mean it’s vastly superior to the last generation or it is good at all. It’s just a marketing catch to get you hooked in into thinking it’s the best of the best.
you are getting for this apple less improvement features + apple gold digger
Im so excited to get mine soon. It should be in the mail soon!
I am kinda confused is this drisha's channels or arun's?
👍
How much money you take from iphone😂😂
অসাধারণ রিভিউ ❤😊
The update is really solid. It’s safe to say if you have a 13 pro or older you should go for the 15 pro, IMO.
voice isolation feature definitely is lit
Bro jappin
5:48 good editing mode.
If you are done with your old phones what do you do with them  I would like one please ❤❤
voice isolation is ios 17 feature not exclusively to 15 series...
Its the 14 fool.
Any mr bean fans??
Beautiful ❤
instead of playing games on my 65" tv, yea I should play on this tiny screen. Definitely, crazy feature.
You , mkbhd , supersaf and every other major english speaking reviewer are apple salesmen You criticize pixel 7a for having only a 90hz but some of you don't even mention iphone 15 having 60hz even though it's twice the price
biased
bro used cat as a phone holder W💀
I like the explanation very past my memories is loading
This has become an 'I love apple' channel in recent times. Sad to unsub after so many years of great, unbiased content.
@Mrwhosetheboss u should DEFINITELY checkout XIAOMI 13 PRO
15 is Shi.   it
This is an AD, not review
ive been using iPhones since iPhone 8 and to be honest iPhone 15 was worse than i thought. Before i loved the idea of what iPhone was doing and i have supported them all these years but now I'm starting to feel like im getting scammed, there is barely any colors now and for what reason is this? no noticeable difference in anything and performance wise, i feel like for $1000 i should be getting more, cause back in the days when i bought my first iPod and iPod mini (this is OG apple product) it offered me something that CANNOT be attained anywhere else. now the only thing that i see that is STILL good with it are the colors but i noticed with the pictures now it's like the software does too much work and eliminates too much shadows. i don't feel like paying $1000+ just to have the same phone again. I tried android for the first time again since i took the iPhone 8 and this was 2 months ago and really tried to learn it and ive decided that i'll be switching to the next Samsung or Pixel model. I'm tired of paying PREMIUMS for NON-PREMUIM stuff. I really miss how apple used to do it back in the days.
We need an apple tv with this power
1600€ pro max 256gb. So it's not $1100.
I bought my iPhone 15 Pro Max this morning and the early signs are that the battery does not appear to be good whatsoever. It seems to run down more quickly than the iPhone 14 Pro max. WTF Apple 😡
Scammed
How much did they pay you?
I miss the iPhone mini💔
wallpaper from 17:33 ?
6:48 Cool 🔥
Hey I'm not being a hater I actually love your videos but not this one . In some way it feels like he was paid to do this
dude speaked 4416 words in a video.
voice izolation its on iphone more then 2 months. I have it on my 13 pro.
What if apple offered a choice of a port and port less phone for the next Iphone
Lets make a guess, how mch apple paid him for ths bullsh*t !
cat’s a paid actor
Thats really lame to quote that "this is standard".  That you only get the slow cable when buying a 1200€ phone is frustrating, especially when it's nearly the only new feature.
Action button way to high, and on top of that on the wrong side...  Who uses a phone in Landscape with the camera on the bottom? 😂
Where did you get that wallpaper?
Appreciate the level of detailed information. ❤
I ordered and canceled after knowing that 14 pro max has the same camera 48mp… only difference charging port. Cheapest Option - Same quality! 🎉😅
Boss fight misic starts playing when Aron starts talking about a camera system, is exactly what have been missing in my life, never realized how much i needed it.
only huawei
can u send me a 15 pro?
The voice isolation has been there for a year or two. So why you make sound it comes with iphone 15???
This was the best review hands down mate….also swayed me to finally upgrade from my beloved 11 pro max!!
23.59/ 24.00/00.00
This bixby button is not something great
Nice
So can i charge new iphone 15pro with my OnePlus fast charger with no problem ?
🤡🤡
All we need to know thank you a lot :)
Man really showing off his beautiful fiance.
4:19 Look at the model id of Right phone "iphone 16" 💀
Next time apple  company introduced android in apple phone 📱
You’re like nas daily
No its not its the same s hit
I have such a high respect for Arun I remember watching his Vita gameplay as a kid then watched his fake iPhone X video during HS. I’m already out of college and im happy he’s still here making tech videos. The grind was real you came a long way man love seeing your smartphone videos
I love your viewpoint 😊
Best review for these phones that I’ve seen! Most other reviewers look lazy compared to this.
This was the best review of the phone  I intend to buy. Infact, this is best review so far of iPhone 15 Pro even better than Marques. Great Work!
$999 for a phone with 60hz screen = a good deal? Right. Sad to see some of the tech influencers be so extremely biased in their reviews..but we all have to make a living, I guess..just watch stuff like this with a BIG grain of salt. And no, I dont think reviewers have to agree with my opinion, but when actual sharp arguments are lacking in the actual video from people that I actually used to respect heavilly I just feel...sad and desillusioned. The "reviews" that many have farted out the last few days makes it obvious that people that started out as lovers of tech have transformed into product placers for the giant companies of the world.....
My dream will remain to use the iPhone😢
1500euro for usb c and new button Nice🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It is iphone advertising
Average consumers don’t understand 24mp is a shit ton in a phone and it’s the quality of the sensor that counts not the MP more is not better (at least from 24-200) I’m a professional photographer and my 3200 camera body is a 30mp sensor
Samsung also uses HEIF😂
Waiting for mr jerry rig
Years ago, I had a note. I really liked the dual window feature. I have no idea if the new iPhone has something like that. With a gigantic phone like the pro max, I would totally use that dual window feature. If it already exists on iPhones, I am not aware of it.
18:30 is not a 100 dollar upgrade. That's a 200 dollar upgrade man. You're literally giving up 100 bucks or half the price
Can't buy still watching 😂
My most important question of all... How is the new screen display next to Samsung's current amoled? Anything yet? Because,  it's looking really good to me
Excellent speech 🎤 ❤
Use me as a like button if you're rocking the S23 Ultra and wouldn't dare downgrade to a 15 pro.
how do you my thinking , tell its better then you think 👎
Breathe. Take a deep breath
Used every galaxy phone from S3 to s22 ultra at the moment! In years, this is the first time I've actually gone ahead n decided to go for an iPhone. Let's see how that choice plays out once I recieve my 15 Pro max
4:40 Android can play gta5 with box64  And can even run windows 11 and run gta5 But yes not natively on android Please cover this as its a astonishing and proud moment for smartphone gamming.
lol is there a giveaway, i really cant afford the 15
Nothing new. I used to it with my Lumia 1020 10 years ago
I wish I can buy a newer phone, using iPhone X and it’s still rocking
I’m shocked that these small changes impress people these days
What Gloves
I'm the one who's still using iPhone 6s 😂
This dude is so apple biased
Thala unoda language mass thala
Love it. All I know is if I can't take a decent picture of the moon tomorrow night after my pro max arrives, in 18 months when I'm due for another upgrade I'll be switching to Samsung!
😂 it's like checking out an iPhone's audio CV. It's really hard to justify the "small things" with small benefits. I mean I am sure we can classify them as benefits, can't we? 😂😂😂
Hit the like button if you grew up as a fan of the Assassin’s Creed series!
Idk Why TF am i watching this Knowing I can't even afford this shit lol xD
Normalize using milo as a phone stand.
copium
How much did apple pay you for this review bruh 😂
The first thing I got from this video is my 11 has the back tap feature 😂😂😂 I’ve had it for three and a half years and had no clue
Making fool of customers
Bruh you can use the volume key as a shutter for the camera from ancient times 😂😂
So iPhone 15 is a software update for iPhone 14 so basically it's just a e-waste
Where did you get the wallpaper from?
How much they pay you to do this video? Action button man? lol come on
How much Apple Pay’s you for saying this
You could think of a video title better than copying marques brownlees Samsung ultra s23 review.
can you send me a one iphone 15
I phone this time I will not purchase
Where can I get that wallpaper?
Cap.
What wallpaper is he using?
This will be my first iphone after using samsung products for over 15 years, the gaming aspect has me intruiged!
So no lightning and no headphone Jack?
Push na push. Apple need this hype so the old model , i mean new one with type c can be sold. Nice try Arun
I knew it. The AAA games for iPhone 15 Pro are just lite/Switch version of the game. Now I need the emulator 😂
❤
This is a really really good Preview ! wonder why this is the first video i see from you
How can she hear him wwhile she can bearly hear herself?
Not impressed with the phone less impressed with all these reviewers bending over backwards to sell an iPhone that is underwhelming in every way. Telling us that this action button provides an enhanced way to take photos is strains your credibility. It’s ok to tell Apple that they are falling behind and robbing their customers.
Congratulations! Even with the deceiving iPhone 15  you are able to show another perspective for the fanboys to keep purchasing outdated technology, Apple should hire you as a marketing boss. Do not forget no one benefits for non improvements in technology and your channel should be focused on letting Apple and all other brands know that we do not need new outdated technology, it is bad for the Earth's contamination and makes us more stupid every day.
is resident evil for ipad pro M1 ??? it’s more powerful than A17
Brilliant review! Best I've seen. Your astute insights and ability to summarise lots of info in a really compelling way is commendable.  Bit of a video editing masterclass too.  Well done!
Link for the wallpaper?
$2198 au with telstra! I think it's the Ned Kelly deal!
Who cares about phone in 2023  not a big thing anymore
I hear it overheats and throttles pretty well.  Way to shove another overpowered chipset in a phone with no way/room to cool it properly...which will also help said chipset degrade prematurely.  All things the general user has no clue about.
I had no idea iPhone had back tap!
Im going to use the shortcut button for shazam.
Another paid promotion to buy a product that is not even required
these are trash phones
Cap 🧢 Paid promo
you a paid fanboy
Ain’t the 14 pro and 15 pro the same camera
Would love to own a iPhone one-day
usb-c, action button and dynamic island the only 3 upgrades from my 13 pro oh the cameras something i rarely use so i just once again don't see any point in upgrading. Time to wait for the S24! since Apple just launches the same phone every year
I hope so! It only another grand.
Things no one really use or need. I’m keeping my coins in my pocket.
I guess I’m confused because he states in the box comes with a sim ejector tool and even on the side of the phone you see the SIM card slot however it actually doesn’t support SIM card like the iPhone 14
wish i had one.. cant afford.. 😭😞
why hasn't the iphone 14 pros have still not yet gone down in price despite the 15 line being released over a week ago?
Haven't we been able to use the volume buttons for photos ... for, well, ever?
Wow! All these features for the price of my organs, what a steal!
Great review, but yeah I even regretted the iPhone 14 Pro Max. I just can’t justify the upgrade. I feel like the rhetoric around the new iPhone is always the same. “Such and such makes this a more compelling iPhone and it stands out for such and such.” Then after the luster of the new features fade away, it’s the same experience it’s been since the X.
Liked how you brought in Dhrisha’s frame with “pretty but more comfortable” phrase in the video - 6:59
Iphone users still getting bamboozled lmfao
Can you share that awesome wall paper on your iPhone 15 Pro?
720p in such a small screen is still better than 900p on a monitor/TV due to the higher PPI in the phone
I like your video.
Not worth the upgrade
Great video but what I suspected from Apple . The true upgrade to a 14 Pro Max will be the 16 Pro Max 🔥🔥🔥
The voice isolation mode as been on my iPhone for the past 2 months
Do an iPad test video
You just  don't want to admit it (samsung is better!!!)
This should be called an update not a new phone. Nothing creative about this. Next.
What is the wallpaper called?
Outside of the mobile app gaming world, Apple is NOT interested in gaming. They dont care about it on OSX. They certainly aren't going to try to compete with MS, Sony, Valve on IOS when they have never tried on OSX. That is simply something they don't care about. People have been saying Apple is going to get into that Arena for 20 years with any nugget of such news.
Great job on this! 🎉
So how much u get paid from Apple 🍎????
Everyone buys/upgrades iPhones every 5th year ......... this is the Beauty of Apple 🍎 - HONEST ONE LINE REVIEW
Still very disappointing the 15…
I still have my iPhone XS, is it worth buying iPhone 15 pro or which one should I upgrade to?
5:35 stereo speakers not surround sound
How much did they pay him to do this?
Excelent Review 👍🏼
The fact you cant reviw the mate 60 pro shows how biased you are. i will stop taking your channel seriously. this western bias has even eaten up good reviewers like you . What a shame
First time watching your channel and I must say this was one of the easiest reviews to watch. Keep doin your thing my man!
The review was done well Butttttt at the end of the day. Apple is pretty much selling THE SAME PHONE. With the extra added Bonus ya got to buy a new charger instead of 3 cam lens knocked down to two. Same chit just a different day.
Can't wait for the Pixel 8 Pro Review
By time I’ll be upgrading my phone apple will be on the iPhone 21 if things stay the same. I just upgraded last year to the 14 pro max from a 6s plus that was still doing it’s thing but it was just time for something more up to date. My 14 pro max still has a 100% battery capacity after a whole year later. My way if it’s isn’t broken why upgrade it.
Might better than I think, but definitely not gonna change what I think
Still no update on the purple wallpaper 😢😢
I love how tech YouTubers act like the majority of people get the new tech every year for every release. Like goof I’m barely able to watch this video because I’m on the iPhone Xs dying to upgrade to the “boring” very new and different iPhone.
Bro voice isolation has been around
You should test what happens if you plug an iPhone 15 Pro at 0% into an iPhone 15 Pro at 100% and see the results
Paid by apple
I'm calling BS...
back tap? why am I just learning about this?
Please Arun, don't sell your soul to Apple...
So what ur saying is Apple should’ve just said we took the iPhone 14 and made it better and usb-c
Waiting for the day we get an honest iPhone review
had no idea about being able to map the power button or the back tap feature???? thanks
I don't like apples sharp ass edges.
This is actually a really good review on the new iPhones but I gotta to say I will hold off on upgrading. I mean I upgraded from the 12 pro to the 14 pro max; really no big difference just camera quality and the material of the devices.
His English accent 😭🫰
I’m still rocking the iPhone 11 Pro max in gold. I’m gutted the 15 pro max doesn’t come in gold or any nice colours like pink. I’m trying to determine whether to upgrade and what one to get 15 plus of 15 pro max. I love taking photos and videos for instagram and YouTube in future.
Apple: Tells you what you need even before yourself do.
When I see people use a phone without a case I know they made it in life
iPhone 2025 for me lol
я смеяйся далал над шуткой про Mega Pixel 😂
Hey, don't usually comment on videos, but I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciated this video. Great coverage, and well produced. More importantly - soooo many tech-reviewers feel compelled to be funny and snarky and end up being terribly annoying. I liked that you're not falling into that trap. Just a great video with great information. Keep it up!
they look like the 14 bro
Hard pass
Better than you think ? Nope title is bad stock with older iPhones folks wait for better
Voice isolation has been there for a while, it’s not an iPhone 15 feature
Is this sponsored video?
The SmartHDR on the XS Max was actually very aggressive but looked unnatural in some scenes. Then Apple decided to dial it way down on the 11 Pro and so forth. I’m glad that the aggressive HDR returns in a natural way.
Great in-depth review
Love your vids, However the first thing I always need to do is turn down the volume.. could do with a little less🙏
7:51 Ayo Chill editorzzzzzz
Great video! I'm so glad I went for the titanium blue 15 Pro Max, because seeing that natural titanium so much on video, which has been the default choice for most tech reviewers, has left me feeling wanting some color.   The more I see the titanium blue, the more of it I want to see. I can't get tired of it!
Still I don't get what is the difference between 14 pro and 15 Pro?🤔
he flipped the iphone and my heart dropped like a foot, i thought he was gonna drop it on the table
😂😂😂😂😂 hardly anything to get excited about, same phone from last year
how can i get that wallpaper
Crap upgrade— apple is lagging behind - 99% users will see no difference in user experience between the iphone12 and 15
Voice isolation is there in Iphone 14 Pro as well 🤷🏻‍♂️
Its a bigsby button. 😮
This is such a good review. Subbed after listening to you on Colin & Samir.
nice
how much is the battery used while console gaming ?
Awesome review, but: adding portrait mode after the fact is something google has been doing for 6 years now. Even on iOS and iPadOS in the google photos app. Wish that it wasn’t sold and talked about as such a brand new and groundbreaking apple innovation (in like 99% of videos and reviews)
When the main "upgrade" is the USB-C port 💀🤣  Come on man, who are you trying to kid? LOL!
Is it worthy for gaming?
Voice isolation is there in iOS 16 too i use it on my iphone 11
My man trying hard to come up with good things to say about the iphone 15 to see if he can get a mention on next year's event like MKBHD did this year....
best tech channel on youtube 🔥💯💯
It’s the same f*****ng phone as the last one. I can’t stand how most of the people are getting excited on apple shit without good reason
Don't get the latest phone anymore , do nothing new ,
Can l please have you iPhone 14 coz l think you not going to use it again 😂😂
the only way to justify an upgrade is if the phone starts slowing down.
No new innovative, just minor upgrades.
More emphasis on camera
who set the boss?
best review!
Your review was way more interesting than the apple presentation - now I actually want to consider one 👍
The gloves during the unboxing is so unnecessary and over the top
It's really funny to see such reviews. I'll buy some other phone
Great video as always. Where is the background wallpaper from??? 😊
Watching on 50$ mobile 😅 I wish one day I could buy this😊
Good take
Aaaaaand again it's the same stuff but differently organized
Can you link that wallpaper
u are amazing i am always watching your rewies
Now I understand why carl pei said apple is boring now. Using 14pro now, happy with it & no excitement like i used to when i switch from iphone 3gs to 4, 5 , 6 then X.
ARUN!!!! How did you not know about the Live Photos being able to save to videos?
This is a fantastic highlight of the phone's features
Next level is a marketing strategy that becomes boring since everybody use it
Like a lot of people feel nothing is very exiting about this new lineup.
If they released and upgraded all the features in one year, no one will buy their phones, the next year as there won't be any new updates...
Such a detailed review!
Apple always have a top marketing way to promote their products with any possible way and make it looks flawless even that products is failing
Hey Arun this is day seventeen of asking for a iphone 14 pro max
so with type c, you can now charge other iphones, how does the phone prioritize? because it can go both ways, does it know which phone is lower and charge up the lower phone from the full phone? and what happens when battery level equalates?
4:41 going to say the same next year and the year after and the year after……….
These things are already exist in Android phones cameras, it's not new
Hi does the isolation mod works in discord? Or just the normal call!
Hey can i get a upgrade for my phone cuz i am still stuck in the iphone 6s (HELP ANYONE)
Anyone got the link for the wallpaper please
$1200? Yes if hou dont look around for better deals or promotions. If you dig around enough you can probably get it new for $900.
Totally paid review. Nothing new portrayed as something more than the last time.  Lame.
But, can it run Crysis?
Yes bro!  This is the best review i've seen!  Thanks for the work behind it!!
I wanted to get an iPhone 15 pro,but my wallet refused.
where can i find that wallpaper??
USB-C is the feature for me. A reason why I waited with upgrading my X and missed the Mini. I hate you all for not buying the Mini.
Congratulations! iPhone has now caught up with the lumia phones !
Titanium is light but can get skratched soo easy :(
iOS 17 have all these options for every iPhone so buying a new one isn’t worth it
This is not a review, this is a comercial.
Its simple: dont buy iPhone, buy Fairphone 👍
literally everyone says this phone is not worth it and this guy is saying otherwise , let me guess... iPhonefanboy?
this guy is so super annoying i literally had to block him.
How last battery long?
So with this new phone could I transfer files from my phone to my ps5
Feel like pub 🍻😜
My old 15 years old Nokia has Action Button as well who YOU can make different Settings.
I'm so excited for the IPhone 15
Thing I don’t like is pro version and pro max have different camera
Is it me or did Aarun make a mistake about the phone prices?  $999, going up by a *hundred, to $1199…? Isn’t that by two hundred?
Props for the background retro wave music! That was literally my bike riding playlist.
Always world best reviewer
Good marketing video
I love watching videos about phones I could never afford :)
No, actually not better than I thougt. It is kinda underwhelming
Reality is in the last four years no improvement that really matters for 80%-90% of the users has been made in Apple or Android phones...
sell out...
I can't wait for mine to arrive!!
Cool review .. thanks . Nice iPhone wallpaper. Link 😊
Nice movie 🍿 bt still I go with Android
I'm still content on my fold 4, once I went fold I can't go back
Your opinions about the Action Button are so good and reality. Apple should bring these in the ip16 pro and promax. Thank a lot bro.
I wonder why Apple didn’t put a titanium back instead of glass? Wouldn’t that have made it even stronger and lighter? But maybe then they wouldn’t sell so many protective cases and Apple care!
I just know the phone's gonna heat up like hell running RE Village and AC, but that's still a huge thing.
🔥🔥मे YouTube हु 🔥🔥 ❤🔥मेरा टेक चैनल है ❤👍 🤔👉मै आपकी मदत कर सकता हूँ ❤
The voice modes aren’t a new feature
Iphone is such a joke man. People are so scared to admit that. Such minor fixes every generation.
MEGA pixel deserves a like
OMG keep it up bro 🔥🔥
True Next level after this, iphones should be launched on moon and mars not on earth for humans, next level development 🤣🤣🤣 You influence us, apple steal our money and then pays to you for this next level vidoes
I was thinking how far these mobile phone camera’s would get. Pretty far, but a Panasonic S5 (full frame) is so capable of high quality shots, no mobile phone can match, if space and weight is not of concern…
You are the best and honest.....Love From Bangladesh
Apple be making me depressed...  Haven't even gotten the chance to use an iPhone  And now Boom!! iPhone 15 is out 😫🤧
Soooo cooollllll😭
10:59, Android:
bro is paid by apple
So few changes that reviewers have to include iOS features in the review.
6:50 rooter 😂
iPhones are incapable of impressing me the last new phone they made was the 12 and it's been the same since.
3:52 Anwar
So someone had to be a sellout after so much criticism on iphone 15 by every other forum on social media. So why not MWTB.
These pictures are not good at all.
The amount of information in this video🤯
Well whoop-de-doo.
Busy watching things I can't afford 😮
You have a slight apple bias, but I enjoy your work 😊
Please do 14 pro vs 15 plus
Skin tones are completely off compared to a pixel phone.
Dude u got paid tons for this video… this is how it feels
It always come in handy to use your cat as a phone stand!
Camera comparison s23 and i phone 15pro max
The wallpaper..?
Did Apple, by any chance pay reviewers for the better/more than you think thumbnail? If the Apple event can't get people excited, YouTube reviews are unlikely to.
I'm wondering how much Apple paying you to say these thing  The only difference between new Apple phones and old ones is they upgrade the camera  It's the same as iPhone 14 or 13
me waiting for iphone 1000000000 super pro max
Android can not beat apple in all aspects
The camera feels like an i phone 14 with Google one features 😂
Lol only new thing is that type c
I’m shocked. Mrwhosetheboss gave the iPhone high praise. Gotta keep that Apple Park access going.
I'm super impressed......NOT!!!!!!
Live mode in Samsung during shutter speed?😅
I would like to criticise the a17 pro and iPhone 15 cause if you wanna play AAA games consoles is still the way to go because of apples ridiculous prices
Im waiting for the samsung s24 ultra (i wont regret it) ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have an action button on my Samsung galaxy s10 ....does that same thing
This is the information i was waiting for!!
What about External SSD support... ?  How's it?
Holdup……. Backtap😂😂
bro can u gift me one 🙃
Paid by apple, he is not delivering honest reviews anymore 💩💩💩
Unlike most people I really enjoy live pictures. That extra Clip usually hides within very valuable details.
secual review bra frosty
SAMSUNG IS MUCH BETTER
Gaming on Android has been around for while
😂😎
Always wanted an iPhone pro Max 😭😭 My favorite phone brand in the world! Never had one tho, lol 😅
save water pls
This guy a plant
I didn’t even know there was a back tap feature. Hahaha
IPhone blows. It's the same shit every 'new' model all while charging you a ridiculous amount for absolute basic features and a shitty charging cord
Unless you send me your iPhone 14 Pro max or the 13 Pro max ❤😂
The way YouTubers have to ride I phone's glock  😅
Old thing in new Skin! I hardly find any innovation in i15. It’s worth not purchasing.
With smartphones in general, where can they improve? I just wonder
Does it still dim to half brightness outside? That is one of the most infuriating things about iPhone.
how do you launch A camera with 3x power button press?
Cant believe we can finally say Apple overdid it!
This review iis the best
So still not a huge upgrade
What's a really new?
Im not letting that Gold PS5 slide what was that Mr Boss 😱
Casually playing Resident Evil with a cat stand.
Considering Sony makes Android phones, I'm pretty sure PlayStation streaming will be coming to Android.
Apple is Apple simplification and beautiful
Waiting for S23 Uttra vs iPhone 15 comparison as usual 🔥🔥
"Much lighter" literally a gram less lmao
“Ayo chill guys” 7:50 😂
Thank you this video helped me decide not to upgrade.
its one apple sticker one....
ngl apple should stop being a iphone company and become a camera company
shes cute and great review
It’s funny how I got a Moto smartphone ad before the video even started 😂
Every big youtubers praise the new iphones, undoubtly Apple throws big money on them 😂
iPhone has stayed on top for long and people are just finding faults for it. Meanwhile this phone is a beast no phone in the market right that can match. iPhone is Messi in football. You can take one aspect which you think a particular brand is better than iPhone but overall iPhone is far better than any brand.
Pro or pro max? What should I choose
Please make a video about Huawei mate 60
Video only in 360 available?
How much this companies pay this reviewers to hype there products, must be large i guess
taik
But then, they should have priced it 25% less.
Always watching the videos while knowing you are to broke to buy it
Not worth the upgrade.
I already have the voice isolation long time ago, and I'm using ip 11 pro max
NOTHING NEW JUST WAISTING 15MIN OF MY LIFE
I don't like they don't let you have the 12mp mode
I normally skip through reviews. I just wanted to say thank you for that review, i watched every second of it. Your very good at what you do! You get a subscribe from me!
Iphone is made for lefthands :D
I was waiting for my guy to drop an iPhone 15 video
This man is a true fan and a dedicated iPhone user. It's not easy to dive this deep into a new phone. Even explained and made little excuses for Apple. A nice review overall. The s24 will just be like this. Minimal upgrades. Slab phones are peaking.
I currently have the base iPhone 11 and plan to make the leap to the 15 Pro Max. The improvements are gonna be massive! Your review has been very helpful, thanks!
Can't wait for the IPhone videos
if you started using gloves, then use black ones, mobile or object  looks more sharp and clear in video
I'm still using an iphone 12 and it's perfectly fine.  I don't understand how or why people keep buying a new phone every year. It's dumb.
I loved the voice isolation mode on iPhone 15 Pro Max!  But then I remembered that I have the same feature on iPhone 14 Pro...
after update,performance is better..smooth but my camera effect,lagging
Mega pixel 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Ordered mine, it should arive by tomorrow can't wait lol, been using iphone 8 since release, hope the upgrade will be worth it.
if you do that isnt the camera upside down.... using the action button as camera button?
So they just released the exact same phone, got it
It's the same phone!
both using iPhone but make chat via WA
Great insights... no one else talked about!
Bruh. My iPhone XS Max and 14 pro max have voice isolation. Nothing new with that
apple cables with woven sleeves are NOT more durable, we got them in keyboard and trackpad, it is very easy to break, because it doesn't have a strain relief, and this seems to have same issue.
Rumours are next year iPhone will get 48mp UW lens and according to an android leaker stacked battery, 40 watt charging and bigger batteries.
I, myself, am not Apple fan but I enjoy how Apple always tries to make quality over quantity People are saying: Another Same phone, no difference, but it's just these little perfections that make a device desirable. Compare it to those big features that aren't tuned and thus Useless.
After watching video, I feel like I need a less fanboy approach to the device.
Apple didn’t say it has 7 lenses they said it’s like having 7 lenses, the battery specs on site are same as the 14.
I feel like apple should have given the 3x lens instead of the 2x lens in pro max.  Like instead of 1x,   2x  and 5x   it should be like 1x,   3x  and 5x.     3x lens takes pretty awesome shots, especially portraits.   5x portraits isn't always practical. Like in tight places where you can't move back, 3x portraits are always better. Also, 3x portraits helps to add a lot more background details, especially when you have a beautiful scenery behind you (that looks cool in the blur/bokeh).  I know that we can manually zoom to 3x optically in the 15 pro max, but the usual 3x lens is more crisp and clear when compared to the manually zoomed 3x.
Please Review Huawei Mate  60pro
Wow Voice isolation such a new feature!  I literally said that like 4 years ago when it came out.
ok
ok
Voice isolation is a copy cat of Google's clear calling
ok
Voice isolation was a feature of IOS 16 and is available for every iPhone supported by IOS 16. Please get your facts right
In my country it’s 1600$ for 15 Pro 256gb, so no thank you
Is there a way to set recording shortcut by triple click power button?
Voice isolation has been in Samsung for ages now.... I remember one time I was in a concert and I was trying to make my friend listen to the music trying to surprise him, but he could barely hear anything while my ears was being blasted by the speakers.
ok
Did anyone else see that in some shots the time on the phones were different???
Guys this man is a apple fan guy
Iphone 11 Pro Max is G.O.A.T 🔥
i usually don't buy the phone when it first comes up with a new feature i buy a year or two later when the feature is adapted by the developers and it's more streamlined
I like how you review, not bias 👍👍
Yeah the closing point is so on point. The price for 15 Pro Max in my part of the country is amazing, same price as the 14 Pro Max 128GB. lol  So in conclusion for those that already owned 14 Pro/Pro Max, thank you for being the beta tester. lol for those that only want to upgrade now, congratulation you have yourself a tested device.
Hi Arun Maini! You've done such a thorough job of the reivew in such a short span of time! All the features that go unnoticed have been covered! Brilliant! I think you've now beaten the other popular Youtuber! 👍
First time commenting here. Have you thought about having an actual voice conversation in real time? Sending voice messages to each other instead of text messages or a voice call is the first time I’ve found you ridiculous 😝
why no one is mentioning the lovely cat helping as a stand for the phone? she deserve some credit for making this video
Other than the Type C advantage, all the positives about other features kinda seemed forced. Especially the new button, unnecessary.
Only 2nd  to MARQUES BROWN ❤
5:00 Milo be like: what have i been signed for
Iphone 15 is just unnecessary if you already have the 14...
this iphone15 is a big dissapointment i think apple is running out of ideas now i mean charging cable and action button is what we should be excited about cmon guys get real these brands are ripping us blind .
Voice Isolation has been around for a while now though...
This video just sold the iPhone 15 for me! I've always been a Samsung user. This will be my 1st iPhone.
Gift me your old phone.
No, that's not standard you always get cable and often brick as well with your phone, that is using phones charging speed potential
Sir i need your help
I have an iPhone I think if they just installed android on iPhone it would be perfect
Voice isolation is not new to the 15, had this on my 14 pro max for a while now.
I like the detail but you need to slow down the delivery please Arun.  The info needs time to “breathe” to enable people to absorb it fully.  Keep up the great effort!
Are we going to see a Huawei mate 60 pro review?
Bad
rip umpc 😂
They must've paid you a good amount $
You could just cast the phone to the tv, walla🎉! You have a fully functioning game 🎮 set with soon to die phone, but at least you milked out all the juice from the money paid for the phone
The title says it all 😅
Leave this apple garbage... I'm waiting for a short speaking Hindi with Trisha
Am I the only one that pointed out that the price gap between pro and pro Max is 200$ and not 100$? 🙂  Haha, anyways grt review!!
Very difficult to spot but I couldn't help spot the fact you're face brightness in broken shining White from those LEDs behind the camera maybe you should turn those down I had to adjust my brightness several times 🤙🏽👍🏽😂
They've finally use type-C 😅😅
Ahhh iphone same shit different year.
Sponsored video and I am unsubscribing. MKBHD is much better.
Next level crap...same same but different 😅
You somehow managed to make an interesting and creative video on the most talked topic on YouTube right now 😂 Respect! The video is amazing :)
superb editing!
How much apple gave you 😉
So is it worth upgrading from 14 pro max to 15 pro ?
Ok Arun, How much did Apple pay you?😂
Was an Apple fan but Samsung are light years ahead 😢
lol
Bruhhh, I feel like I watched a 3 hour movie in 20 mins! Crazy work Arun!!
You can't be serious...
So which one is better, the iphone 14 or 15 because I can't decide
iPhone should focus more on bettering their cameras and changing up their interface and software to make it feel different and also they could better the memory capacity because from a smartphone standpoint iPhone is not good in that aspect
This was The Best video about iPhone 15 pro max. Great job 👍🏼👍🏼
real men do not use iphones.
Pls compare Samsung and iPhone
I discovered the back tap with this video 😆😆 have been using the 13 since 1 year now
Resting your phone on your cats butt 💀🤣😂😂
What’s on your shirt ? 🏴‍☠️
Why can't you reverse wireless charge? How much is the total zoom after 5x? Why does the Pro max only have the 5x zoom? Apple is so dumb.
20min Ad of Iphone Nothing New Pro
its not
I feel like you have to find things to say about these iPhones.
"the thing that is shooting the photos" ~Mrwhosetheboss, 2023
he literally seing this on the brightside which is enough for the iphone. i mean, who play that type of game on a fckin small design. it's so ridiculous
11 Pro shape results in it being dropped frequently. Its the second worst thing about the phone
This is not a review. It is more like a confession to Apple. 😅
but my iphone 13 also has voice isolation option
Mr whose the boss is that guy❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sony have their hands in the apple pie so a partnership could be possible
Straight into action. A crispy, perfect review, which is exactly what I need (On why I shouldn't get the new iPhone, lol)  @Mrwhosetheboss shows us he is the boss, always.
Stunning wallpaer, how to get?
Voice isolation was there on iPhone 13 pro also
Watching your reviews made my choice getting my 15 pro in blue tomorrow so can’t wait an amazing upgrade from my amazing 12 pro
When Samsung launched S23 Ultra Arun said : This S23 ultra.... is.... well the least impressive looking phone upgrade I've ever seen..  Now what's your comment on iPhone series design other than that of changing colours?
Who else is watching this while high on fentanyl?
Sony Xperia shutter button 🤧🤧
Could I have one of them
I wish new improvements between phone generations would be more on the software side. Maybe it's the software engineer in me but the physical camera improvements are getting really boring.
😂💨💩 why should I believe you, probably got money from Apple to say that
Yo... hearing M539's music on this was super nice.
I could listen to you all day long my friend. Great review.
He's tripping.. type c and apple 15
Does that mean we can now take portrait mode shots with proraw on?
I still dont get why people are so impressed by the console gaming on the phone thing. Because you would still need to be connected to a charger to do any kind of gaming on these phones and that means you need to be home. If you are home anyways, why use a phone to game with its cluttered buttons and smaller screen, you can directly use your laptop or console on TV. So this phone console gaming makes no sense. Why would anyone do that.
So it’s actually iCamera 15proMax.
Mriamtheboss😂😅
:-/ These positive reviews actually make me sceptical. It's obvious with the iPhone 14 and 15 that they are not innovative. Unfortunately, the YouTubers who already have the phone never say that. It's only when it's on the general market that the critical voices come out.
7:50 ayo chill"😂, hope that's your hand that wiped the buttons.😅😂
A wowen cable upgrade will make me buy an apple? Welcome USB-C 5 years ago.
I am still going to switch to samsung S24 ultra next year from my iphone 11.
lol I already forgot about back rough thanks
HDR is also available on PS4 though
Voice isolation and FaceTime effects is an ios 17 feature. Not only for 15 pro
i
Why do you like to compliment Apple, why don't you tell the truth, Apple is the stingiest company
16:17
Apple should hire this guy like seriously ❤❤
anyone coming from a iphone 11 ? i dont have the budget for a new phone but want one what phone should i start with. and if i simply said fuck it lets just but one what phone should i get
I won't say anything until i see the S24 ultra because this apple upgrade is kinda low 😢
The Voice isolation and wide spectrum mode is available too, on iPhone 13, and my prev. iPhone XR also has this feature. So I don't know how big is this feature on the new iPhone lineup.
Is your video quality good , it does not look like you are techey  person
Lol she a baddy
When u justify saying these features are common for all phones The ether phones in much lower price category give way much more like a charging brick faster charging You are justifying apples act of giving poor quality of cable that doesnt even allow the faster speeds of charging This series of iphone has been the shittiest ever i have seen till date that too with the price they are selling PS : i am not an iphone hater i am an iphone user and this is my opinion
Tech reviewers when Pixel had given 60hz display to their latest lauch : 🤯😤🐕‍🦺 Them when iphone had given 60hz in their latest model : 🤐🤫
Wow as if the sound button wasn’t able to take photos for like a decade now
Hello mr. Boss good day im from the Philippines your number one fan all over the world and i would like to thank you for your great reviews on all gadgets especially iphone, i love iphone but i don't have any iphone because i can't afford to buy, i have only android but if you have extra iphone i will accept it even it its 2nd hand thanks you so much nad more blessings to come and god bless you always
I am YouTube channel Dipendu 999
But still photo looks like painting when zoomed in very much in samsung and iphone both where pixel photo start looking blurry when zoomed in as our eye naturally perceive when we go too near the object. Its feela more natural then extra sharpening that both iphone and samsung do
Really helpful. Thank you!
Same phone literally same phone even has the battery of the iPhone 13
Nobody hold phone in this direction, mate. This feels so wrong 😅 10:17
Bro is touching grass while gaming
Someone please give link of the wallpaper he had at 1:22
If you are having an old iphone maybe 12 or older then you should upgrade to iphone 14 because i feel iphone 15 is a waste of all your money. And if you have a iphone 13 or 14 model and you are considering 15, then better consider a docter.
Should I buy iPhone 15 or s23
Waiting for camera comparison with 14 pro max
Is it suitable if I upgrade from iPhone 6 to iPhone 15 Pro?
There's nothing new here that matters to me, Android still top on my list
The fact 📸 features already way before done on pixels 😆
I think he ended up telling us more about his fiancé down the phone😂😂
So this is what the 14 pro was suppose to be? 😂
Where can I get this purple wallpaper please?
Words of a bias fanboy reviewer
Comedy 🤣 phone smaller update,  please trogh away,
This creator has been bought and paid for by Apple 🥸  If you’re stuck somewhere with your phone to play “console games” you probably are not dragging a freakin PlayStation/xbox controller with you.  This would be great for better support but so far from it
And the review everyone really wants is the Huawei Mate 60 pro! Crazy that all the major reviewers are pretending it just didn’t happen😂
I really do hold a grudge over the exclusion of a charger. You can't keep telling your customers to rip the seats from the old car and put 'em into the new one.
Isn't it 200$ gape
Man I wish I had an iPhone, im saving for the 15 now but I've only got 800 so I'm pretty close 🤷🏻‍♀️
Mr Man. There's no amount of review that will make us buy it. I am Okay with my latest Mi phone
To make video short the nee iphone just comes with a usb c port
That's why I thought. It's as I think (stale) and not better! Sorry, but this looks to be a review that's either paid by Apple or made just "for the sake of content".
Android 5 had search at recent apps. Looks like we're going back
The days of people queueing up outside the store overnight to get a new iPhone are long gone. This incarnation was basically a 14S
Sux
What is that wallpaper on the 15 pro??? I need to have it
S 23 ultra ❤❤❤❤
But however who use phone without case?
It seems like an promotional review
Sure sure soo much better
This video feels biased … lol
You’re the best!
Bro has a beautiful wife nerds for the W
Tech Youtubers: Don't buy the new iPhone   Also Tech Youtubers: The new iphone is the greatest iphone ever it has made my life so much betetr.
looks like you're forced to do this one.
Wallpaper link please!!
You can now play death stranding on the iphone? Wow
👍👍
This is one of the most comprehensive, best hosted reviews I've ever seen. MKBHD has some competition. Well done sir!
No
Amazing review & very entertaining. 5 Stars ⭐️’s! Watched from Miami Beach 🏝️ Florida, USA 🇺🇸. I learned a new word from you too called “Faff”. LOL I’m going to use that like it’s going outta style now. Thanks again brotha👍🏼
About Action Button. You just didnt realised, that its made to right handed people, not for you :D
okay ,where i can get the wallpaper ?
Me watching this on my xaomi redmi 7💀💀💀
The thumbnail was misleading..
Can we talk about Black shark and Red magic phones??
Every influencer hard selling the iPhone all at the same time right now.
He's typical nibba😂😂
android user switching to this lol 😂😂😂
only camera is the upgrade and nothing else 😅
This was quite a watch. Excellent job!
Voice isolation on iphone and voice focus on samsung a series seems like same
9:00 14:25 16:30
Why would you get a sim tool in the box? there isn't a sim slot.... You wouldn't even need it if your old phone had a sim lol
it hink i ve never heard about pc game ported to phone.. lots lots of game have been ported to android..
Comparing an iPhone to a Samsung is like comparing a Honda Civic type R to a VW GTI. I will always pick the GTI.
I only clicked on this to read the derogatory comments that apple deserves
That a cat or tiger cub!
I've just tried voice isolation on my 12 mini and it worked about as effectively as the video showed for the 15 (had music blaring and recorded a message with and without voice isolation and the music was completely masked when VI was on), so not sure why this is mentioned as a breakthrough feature for the iPhone 15! Other than that, great review as usual.
This got to be a joke.... atleast samsung is innovating with a foldable, apple has the same models every year and +1 on the name... apologies for been such a grumpy guy
WAY BETTER than the mate 60, and its not lies like the mate 60
uh... use it as a shutter button for the camera? The volume button already works that way xD and has been for YEARS. it's cool u can program that button tho i guess...
LOL my IPhone 11 can literally 9/10 of the things that IPhone 15 can do… thank you Apple for software updates!
Watching this video on a 3 year old plus poco x2 lol
most of the youtubers becomes bootlickers of apple now a days
"Better than you think" well that's a very low bar
No no no man iPhone is disgusting I will definitely go for Samsung
2:04 you don't normally hold your phone like that, seems like coping to me. 1:20 how is it standard for most phones to get slow transfer speeds from the stock cables?
Whoever tried to justify the new iphone 15. I can't be fooled for another recycled phone it's literally an iphone 14 with a few changes and with still with same price range? Lmao
Yeah take some more money from apple lmao
get the iphone 15 pro max and then explode tons of tnt in minecraft until it crashes lol
This video literally feels like Tim came all the way to his home to deliver the money 😂
This guy must of gotten paid by apple to say that
If they could map Shazam to the action button, it would be worth it
We are now at a stage where dynamic island is groundbreaking 😂😂
$200 price gap
🙄 not better then you think. So lame. So paid to say this. No, it’s just not that great.
Ppl will use cases, why back taps
Bro trying HARD to make positive content for Apple, meanwhile there's a whole tsunami of meme on iphone 15😂, gawd it's so funny
All of those new stuff on the phone like the action button etc has all been around for quiet a bit, eg on the Redmi k50 gaming phone they have 2 pop up ones for gaming and it is my short cut for camera and light. i love switching phones so i do it every 6 month. all i can say is there are only selective amount of Chinese phones got export outside of china and not much reviews about them and because of that ppl outside of china do kind of get impressed very easily  . ooooh this is crazy good wow its nice kind of reaction. which is kind of funny. software is in the same problem. WE CHAT in china is like fb + voice-notes + more yet no 1 knows about it and fb voice is hard to use. and not to mention like thin bezel and a lot of other function is sometimes like u just take for granted. NO 1 even mention that when Chinese company try to sell u a phone as it is like practice standard but with apple they talk about everything and make it sounds like a break through in tec . More to it is some company outside china always manage to find the worse phone to import and sell it to us with the worse price possible. some xiaomi phone only cost me 100 NZD to buy in china and i bought one to play with ends up became my alarm clock and the same phone they sell for about 600 NZD in New Zealand.
Apple missed the chance to use Titanium (ft. Sia) as their song for the 15 Pro 😂
I want the mute switch back, no reason to remove it instead of just simply adding the button. Now I’ll be using it… as a mute button but now I can’t visually see what mode it’s in and I have to go through software to use it. Dumb justification of that action button
I've been using Android all my life (well, I bought iPhone 6 many years ago and after one evening with it, I became angry and took it back to the shop the next morning), and now I really can't decide between buying Samsung S23+ and iPhone 15 Pro .. and also Pixel 8 is coming soon..😵‍💫 Guys, maybe you can tell me something? I would appreciate getting constructive thoughts from someone who used both Apple and Android IOS🙏
The voice isolation is not something new. I was using it in my old iPhone XS with iOS 16 and worked very well by the way
The megapixel joke got you a sub
Nice commercial bro 😂
I think this guy should have presented the iPhone 15 during Apple event instead of the Apple employees
So apple is entering the handheld market, have fun Nintendo.😂
The volume buttons already an acts as a shutter button.
Yeah yeah...no thk you i stay with my galaxy note 5
Fun fact: hief is also in androids
8:21 <----just click
All they do is changed the standard wallpaper to make the phone look better    Year after year
I’ll upgrade when Thunderbolt arrives to iPhone 😅
You were already able to take photos with the volume up button without needing the action button.
I suggest Apple to use a finger print sensor on their Apple logo
Enter
Here’s an interesting point: console games coming to iOS, combined with macOS Sonoma’s game porting toolkit should mean gaming on Mac is now a real path.
Love this channel, helps me make my mind up as to which way im going to go. Being a Samsung user for the last 5 years, im tempted to jump back since Apple have finally got their head in the game! Cant wait to see the comparsion videos before i 100% make my mind up!
Voice isolation isn’t new.
When I’m inside my house, or in restaurants, my 14 pro max on 12mp mode took sharper photos than my s23 ultra in 200mp mode, in fact due to the slow shutter speed the s23 ultra when inside a building looks about the same as my xs max.  Can’t wait to get my 15 pro max and get an even better camera experience with the new portrait features
The iphone bokeh, defocus, blurred edges, have so much fringing.  I can't believe people are  falling for the heavy 2d processing that Apple utilizes.  It is absolutely fake.  What client would pay for a final image?  its fine for the average person, but hardly professional 'pro' level.
You can lie smartly and convince people very easy welcome to YouTube u will buy what we will present 👍
Battery test please
Want to drop that wallpaper?
indeed, the borders are thinner between the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 15 pro. But why don't you show the difference between the iPhone 14 pro and the iPhone 15 pro for the edges?😅😅
Aaron, youve finally sold me. I'm making the switch. I just ordered my pro max. Can you do a video about switching from android to ios? You must do this all this time. Not just how to get Gmail on the new phone, but the functional differences. Taps, double clicks, all that. Everything just covers what's new.
Can you give me a free phone
Some of these features are not exclusive to the iPhone 15. They are iOS 17 features which are available on much older iPhones. A little bit misleading I’d say. Makes you wonder 🤔
I've had my iPhone 12 for 2.5 years and today I learned about double tap 🤯🤯🤯
Crazy how camera pics look better than seeing life with my eyes
Got this upgrade from 14 Pro to 15 Pro mostly due to Titanium.  The gloss sides of the 14 Pro are a serious pain. Get mine Friday, 15 Pro in natural titanium.
I'm fine with my 12ProMax.
Great video! Super in-depth. Thank you 😊
Look at you bro!! More subs than Linus and most other reviewers and rightfully so!!
Another Apple paid review talking good about all the nothing new that iPhone 15 brings this year but washing your brain with youtuber trying to convince everybody talking wonders about Apple every new android flags hip launched this year will be on par or offer superior features than iPhone 15
This video is very very convincing I was gonna settle for the 15 plus but you’ve totally convinced me of why the pro max make so much more sense
Cameras? I hardly take pictures
Great video and thumbnail
I want to watch a full on comparison between the 15 pro and the 15 pro max
mrwhosetheboss: much lighter apple: iphone 15 is 1 gram lighter
In your battery test, can you please include the nothing phone 2?
bros using his cat for a phone stand 💀
wallpaper link?
Noise isolation is already on a lot of iPhones before iPhone 15.
voice isolation is a old feature
Need that blue titanium Pro Maximus Prime.
How much better is voice isolation from previous generations? I used it on the 12 pro. So it's not "new"
So wich usb c cable do we need ?
I love how he had his phone on his cat! 5:10
Let's see what's samsung has to offer with S24 lineup next yr.
Hello once you put your phone protection case on you really wouldn’t notice anything how many fingerprints you do you put on it
Not interested at all! I don’t need an expensive camera! Happy with a low cost phone
It’s either MKBHD ,MrWhosetheBoss or bust
Hello, Mr Who's The Box,  Am Alan samuel from Ghana and I enjoy watching your videos. Can you please give me and of your old used phones?? My phone screen is cracked which makes it very difficult to watch your video. I will be glad to hear from you or any of your wide fan base.
kinda reminds me of the iPhone 12 fsr, i have absolutely no idea why 🤷‍♂️    oh and the 13    oh and the 14     oh and the 11
Can’t wait to get it!!
They’re relly onto something with this gaming-iphone jig.
voice isolation isn’t new
The way you jump on your chair, I hope it doesn’t break some day
Does anyone know how to get or where you can find that sick purple wallpaper he is using for the thumbnail of this video as well as in the video???
Can we get compatibility with android for ❤ and 👍🏻 lol. So tired of mixed group chats
Good video but missed the USB c video out using display port on all iphone 15.  Has the capability make it a powerful mobile gaming console on pro/max.  And opens up the future to some apple version of Dex / android desktop (pixel 8 rumour)
@whosetheboss can u kindly give me yr 14 am using an iPhone 6 please 😢
Where i can get the wallpaper, pls ?
Biggest fan have watched all your videos and please keep up the good work also this is my first time commenting on anyone channel, your a star to me wish to become like you in the nearest future or just meeting you will be better keep the good work up
"i still have an iPhone 12" Me operating of off a 4 year old Huawei 😂😂😢😢😅
Apple paying them sponsors a lot to boost them sales on this software update that they should've called 14S, but they want the premium price for the EU punishing them.
I'll stick with my non sheeple Samsung thanks.  Love your content though :)
😂😂apple fan boy
Will you do a drain test anytime soon?
PLEASE ENOUGH OF AFTER FOCUSING FEATURE, HONO 8 IN 2017 HAS THIS EXACT SAME FEATURE, TO CAPTURE AND THEN CHANGE THE FOCUS AFTERWARDS.
As usual the Apple zombie sheep will be camped out overnight to buy it. They always let rich people manipulate and control them
WALLPAPER @8:30 ????????? please someone give me a link
Am I tripping or the 15 pro white looking like blue now 😂
Still looks da same
IPhone is IPhone,,which is the same o IPHONE,,,,SMH!!.
All models of the ps4 did support hdr
Any info on the spatial video feature?   Is it even available to use at this time on iOS?
5:32 what’s the name of the game he playing
Mrwhosetheboss can I get your iphone from 2 years ago
Next level same s**t as 8 years ago.. 😮
The regular 15 is the best value for money. Pro’s still stuck with 6gb ram from the iphone 12’s
this is cool but really sad to see as a iphone 7 user ;(
Already pre ordered it myself
Thank you for covering features that other reviewers didn't, like the voice isolation mode. That's actually really cool and will be very helpful for people in loud environments!
You can first sit down and then start the video recording. Just saying.
Apple presentation: USB-C such wow  Mrwhosetheboss: Provides consumers reasons to buy  *Watched on a Samsung S22*
wallpaper in the thumbnail?
Paid by Apple
bruh cmon
Create an iphone 15 black review please. Fan from Philippines. 😇
Did you miss the Ti part? I’ve been waiting years for a Titanium iPhone and it’s an engineering work of art; more so this year compared to previous iterations.
Nothing new still
This is the first phone review I’ve seen, in at least 10 years, where they actually talked about the PHONE. 😊
My pixel 7 has had voice isolation for the last year. Apples literally just copying other phones
After many years of using Iphone I switched to S23 Ultra and I don’t regret this decision.  Nothing new that surprises me in iPhone but one day i’ll go back i guess.
Bro sold his integrity for the apple money...no way he believes what he's saying that this is a ground breaking new phone
I like the Bixby button. I mean action button.
Must be obvious Apple had NDA rules in place for everyone talking how good the 24 megapixel camera is.
this video is longer but still not interested in iPhone 15
Love how u use your cat as a phone holder
It’s the same as p[ro max
I realize the chance of you replying is slim, but I noticed there's people selling new 14 Pros at discounted prices. Do you think it would be worth it to get a 14 Pro with hundreds taken off the price or do you think the loss of battery life is not worth the advantage of the discount? Will you be comparing battery life between the 14 Pro and 15 Pro in upcoming videos? Thank you
Coming from someone who gets the phone for free. You’re opinion is paid for.
Nice. Finally found the video to help me justify upgrading from my 14 Pro Max 😅
Rich people wasting clean water is instant down vote.
Where can I find that wallpaper?
does the base 15 have pro raw
7:50 AYO CHILL
Thanks for the video.  Can you give a recommendation link for a better charging cable for my 15 promax?
Anyone watching this video: I’ve been trying to turn on the personal voice, I’ve done the recording and now it tells me to put it it on charging and block my phone I did so but still it is on 0%. Can anyone help?
For the game one. It has been Done multiple times before even the 15 came out. Both on the Iphone and s23U
Very bad review. Boring!
بالله عليكم ادعولي قناتي تكبر لان هي كل املي لان مافيش شغل راضي يقبلني عملت قناه ونفسي تنجح لان عندي اعاقه ف رجلي والقناه دي كل املي ونفسي 😢😢😢😢😢
Im already using voice isolation feature with iphone 12 mini, can you tell how its different in iPhone 15 pro?
I thought he was gay
MrChubbyBoss in love indeed. 😍
I honestly dont quite get why now having the option to automatically take portrait shots is anything special or new - you can get ANY image to be a portrait with Google Photos for years :D
Nah thanks I m good with my s23 ultra
4:15 6699 noice
Wow, your recording audio is really good. What camera do you use?
Samsung is still the king of resolutions
Please how did you play resident evil of ps4 on the iphone
All these to salvage the iPhone? 🏃🏾‍♂️😂😂😂
I have big hands, even if I was an adult, even on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, that is why I am getting one
I love his accent
the only people saying the phone is amazing and better than you think and a huge step up....are people making money to say it. no one else thinks its worth going from a 13 or 14 to. maybe not even a 12.
Nice video, great review.please tell me if you want, the name of wallpaper or the link for download
still looking for a review that can tell me if 15 pro dims its display like 13/14 pros do when heating up a bit or not.
Heyyyyyyyy Drisha!
showing tanisha when u say just as pretty can be defined how well u plan ur videos :p
Get the iPhone 15 Pro Max? Or wait for the Samsung S24 Ultra? That's where I'm at right now.
*This is getting out of hands.* Promoting these trivial features so people get tricked to see them as the main selling points is unacceptable!
You lost me at Apple Iphone
Can i have that phone ? Ill send you my address ❤ here in the Philippines . I get the best answer from this video in full details ! 😮
Voice isolation was already in existence on iPhone 13?
I love your reviews and insights but on this one, I feel like you are giving Apple and trying hard to justify this product. It has at most minor upgrades and to make claims that the iPhone 15s design is a high point and slimmer bezels that are now so common on other phones are a feat is laughable. The camera improvements are nice but they are not game-changing nor are they reason enough for the ordinary person to upgrade.  Your claim that the move to put the USB-C on the iPhone was "always on the horizon"  or that it felt like the switchover was imminent is a stretching of the truth, it literally took the EU forcing Apple to make this design change which Apple had resisted. We are talking of an industry standard that has been out for several years and has been widely adopted already. Apple made this move due to EU rules.  I am beginning to think that it is this over-exuberant acceptance and praising of anything Apple does by influential tech enthusiasts and reviewers that in part keeps Apple content with not innovating anymore and continuing to sell slightly improved products for high prices.
Saving up for it 🤞
you know your watching a top tier unboxing video when they have gloves on
Guft me ur old phone🥹
I already play PSP games on iphone with sideloading and it works great. Games that looked bad on PSP look amazing in 4k basically. Makes the games even more enjoyable than they used to be.
Laughs in Android. They've been doing all of this better for decades.
Great vid, that voice isolation feature is insane! i hope it works with AirPods in use? Have you tested it with AirPods?
When is it gonn be available available to buy?
Not that I’m trying to be discriminating anything I’m just saying bro how did you upgrade from the iPhone 15 if it just came out like yesterday😂
Please next time fix the light at the studio or do something about light on your face. It was annoying to watch. It felt like you did make up to make your face more glossy.
Just looks like every other Iphone they've launch year after year wasting the planets resources....no thanks! Smartphones really have stagnated with design and excitement and as soon you buy the "latest one" its then outdated 11 fucking months later.....
Where can I find this wallpaper?? Love it
Where can we get that wallpaper
What an apple rider
Will the reverse charge, charge the powerbank or the other way around? Thanks
Can I charge my MacBook with my iPhone?
Since u got the new phone can I have the old one plz
Boss ..you have lost the plot...or been paid off by apple.  Been a apple man always but iphone changes are ridiculous! A joke ! A mockery of intelligence.. you guys are raving on about USB C port like its a game changer !! Holy crap ...the notch is still ugly, the camera ans screens inferior at best equal to Samsung...its a day light robbery and your promoting this nonsense.. sorry bro ..u got this one wrong
So basically the same exact phone as the previous model... With some camera upgrades no one asked for. If you go back to the last models unboxing vids you'll hear everyone praising the camera, so why did it need upgrades If no one was complaining? Notice half this video is about the camera...if you want top quality photos buy a camera and keep you phone. Once again proving apple idiots will buy anything being sold.
I just found you and I was soo amazed by the quality of the vid. Like the dynamics and the flow... Then I looked at the subs amount... Man, WELL DESERVED!
its the same phone
iPhone 16 with ps 5 games …..want gta v and last of us and uncharted 4
Only new features I like is gaming experience..
Alwyas pick the iPhone that “sucks” if you want to upgrade to one with a big upgrade. Dynamic island not leaving til iPhone 17 at least
Blue vs black? Also, it’s a very well made video, good job
Bluds hair is done with him
Iphone is almost caught up to samsung they are still way behind from what samsung has already perfected in there phones and the cable you get is a fast charging cable with the samsung phones. Apple is just cheap slow and junk I'll never go back to iPhone after owning android/samsung so much more to customize from the base of the phone with out having to have an app to make apps look different
that was the most hideous PS5 I have ever seen
😂😂😂
6:07
How much apple paid you to do this Arun, cuz nah still not sold.
action button as a shutter button is kinda mid bc Samsung phones use the volume button for that already
Got the same caption for s23 ultra.
11:42
Tech review genius 🎉
How long you have been in finance mode 😂 that's basically girlfriend boyfriend think right??
Basically a camera phone
When u talked about the difference between 15 pro and 15 pro max you mentioned the better zoom, the bigger storage, and the better battery life but you didn’t mention the bigger screen? Come on man, the main difference between 15 pro and 15 pro max is the SCREEN SIZE!
Simply, its not.
Very interesting
Sorry but did you never heard from Xbox Cloudgaming. I think your videos  were better  in the old times.😢
I got the iPhone 14 Pro a month before this came out and I regret it SOOOO much and this made me SO jealous because I have to wait 2 years to pay it off to be able to get a new phone
The best the worlds richest company can do, what a joke.
If anyone gives me iphone 15 pro max i granted change bgmi gaming history ❤
Love this video but the voice isolation is on too my knowledge all the way to 12s
He's gonna say its better than u think. He's an isheep lol
My 12pro  has voice isolation
Can you buy this iPhone with a sim tray in the USA?
CAP! IPhone clearly paying you. IPhone 15 is absolute joke.
The apple glazing in this video is off the charts. An 8.9 on the apple dick-in-your-cheeks scale
this apple glazing 💀💀💀
BRO U PPL ARE SO OBSESSED WITH IPHONE, EVERY YEAR SAME SHIT FOR HIGHER PRICES.
Why is there a sim removal tool if the 14 and 15 are on eSIM??
The fact it has usb-c now is enough for me to upgrade honestly
Great review!  But the difference between 999 and 1199 is 200; not100. 😞
Man, the soundtrack is straight from low budget 1980's movies 🤣
This guys got paid by apple for sure
Right2Repair. Apple is a no go
Is it really money what restrickts the creativity 🙄
Voice isolation is not a new feature
All youtuber trying package the same sh$t like last as a revolutionary thing😒whhhyyyy?
There is nothing better than you think about Iphone 14 to 15, Of course he gets paid from Apple to do this review and to boost up the sales.
8:35
Don't even care much about resident evil on iPhone. iPad tho.....
Me watching this while I just got a 14 pro
I love your preview
Even base PS4 featured HDR.
Lol, you guys say the same exact thing every single year 😂😂😂😂
I didn’t realise how old the 11 looked until you compared it😂
How much this people pay him?
Samsung Galaxies already have a voice focus mode in the calling to reduce the background noise.
Don't you feel Apple is paying of youtubers as an effect of their bad selling numbers? Doesn't feel like a review, but a selling ad.
Can you investigate the overheating issue of iPhones?
Worse than I thought
biggest scam for this iphone is that they are selling an 800$ (even more in europe) phone with a 60hz screen
I'm switching from Android after like 8 years and I gotta say the fact the OnePlus Nord n30 and the galaxy a54 both have 120hz while being <$499 is giving me second hand embarrassment
got an iphone 11 pro since 4 years and I am getting my 15 pro on friday - super excited!
Absurd.... clowning
don't buy it. if you are using 14 pro max.
Smart Man, You avoid apple 120mm zoom Lens lies. Apple pays you well. GOOD Job Dude.
Swear I’ve had voice isolation already lol
Sim eject tool even tho it doesn’t have a sim tray?
the action button served its purpose for you and it will serve different purposes for millions, therefore apple won
When are apple shipping the iPhone
You tried taking a photo of the moon with it?
He forgot the "sponsored by apple" bit
Wait...! 🤔 If it's a 3x digital zoom. Then how and why are you saying that my face's distortion is corrected a bit and then it's stunning in 5x zoom. 😮 Yes 5x might have impact, because it's optical. But how would a digital zoom make the distortion correction as far as software processing isn't kicked in...!!!? 😵‍💫  Think technically...!!! 🤔😃
When are we getting a battery test
hi
why the heck do you have 24,000 notifications on you  mail
Somewhere must be a YouTuber who really get tired of review same device year after year after year with that "updates" that really are coming in drops and no creativity or innovation anymore just random improvements mostly  for keep buyer's interest alive .. Once upon a time Steve jobs gave us a totally new device every time and a lot of this same improvements that we are receiving these years for free in every iOS update .. I remember after an iOS update your device really used to feel and look like an entirely new device .. And innovation's where always ahead of others ..
I hate how people are so easily adopting a marketed language like "portrait mode" being synonymous with background blur (= shallow depth of field = larger aperture). While in "real"photography these are two different unrelated concepts. You can make a portrait of someone with any depth of field. These simplifications that marketeers like are making people less informed /knowledgeable. Marketing = evil.
portrait mode is cinematic? Don't you mean landscape?
Ayo chill😂😂😂
Love the wallpaper on the phone! Do you have it to share?
Please send me one of 15 pro max😢
I'm using the dynamic spot app for my nothing phone and it can basically do the same but it has additional features so I like that
Is15 pro waterproof?anybody knows?
5:00 I just want Nintendo to team up with Apple and let us use the iPhone as a Switch console. Imagine how much the higher storage iPhone sales would go up along with Nintendo games
Actual Copium
7:51 AYO CHILL BUDDY STOP IT THATS SUS. PICIOUS. BRUH
This ducking guy is a sponsor of Apple but he softly advocates it , by necessate the advantages and then smoothly undergo disadvantages and manipulating our mind , cancel him
Great review! I think you might have just helped me finalize my decision 😉
Make a video about Poco X5 Pro 5G!
20min video for minor things... You are not the only one but it seems like a waste of time. Otherwise love your videos.
Honestly, this felt like an ad more than a review. 😕
8:22 dope bass, never fail to get us 😂
@Mrwhosetheboss...  I have never ever seen you addressing the software update issue which I'm sure is faced by a handful of customers. Looking forward to seeing the content on your channel.  Thanks.
Apple stock going to tank soon. Thanks to Iphone 15.
imagine gta 4 or 5 running on an IPhone 😂
Congrats on the fiancé
Idgaf if its "standard" to get a slow cable with your phone. Its lame that the most killer feature of this phone is the usbc 3 speeds and port, but they don't even give you the capability to use it out of the box. Lame. (I still ordered one though :\ )
Irony is every reviewed videos is more than 15 mins for i-15 it seems they have been guided.
Aron can you add time stamp to your vídeos.  I very much respect the creator's who has them . 😊 TIA
Wow.. You guys got it already thought it was gonna come out November
How much money
Apple should start making consoles, bye bye to Sony and Microsoft if they do
after this I want to buy an iphone 15
Battery seems to be worse then the Iphone pro 14 pro max. And since Iphone 14 Pro Max has worser Battery than the Iphone 13 Pro max. It seems the Iphone 13 Pro max is the champ of Battery
Next level review too !
Waiting for the S24 Ultra to take a decision...  I'm coming from the Note 20 Ultra
Apple tries hard to make people believe this is desirable.
glad iphone is going in the right direction, but sticking with my 14 pro max 🙃
we still are not ahead  of apple!!! subscribe to pass them😀
Apple reviews are usually about how we have to adjust to the new features or how we should use it. As if we are the dumb ones. It's just sad to see how they are exploiting their customer loyalty.
Apple really should have included the USB-C with the 14 Pro. The 15 Pro is literally almost the same thing, with *slightly* better graphics and *slightly* better camera. USB-C is definitely great, but is it really worth $1200+
Cap

Bro, your animations when you throw your phone in the air looked so dope!
I loved the effect at 6:48 ♥
ooo nice edit mr editor, loved when you illuminated the playstaions!
still a skip for me, wasn't worth upgrading to the 14, and now definitely not worth upgrading this year
WOW You and the Raiden player were cookin broo🔥
This is such a fantastic video.
Waiting for mine to arrive…
Can u connect iPhone 15 pro to an external monitor?
Ok stupid question but how do you have this phone when it's not even released yet?
How do i think
From all the kind of noises you might have chosen, you chose pouring water, yeah not sure about that .. Great review tho
isnt going from 999 to 1199 not just 100 dollar more, its actually 200? and i think they switched to USB C because theres a new EU law that all devices have to have USB C
Should I upgrade from an iPhone 12 to a iPhone 14/14 pro or iPhone 15/15 pro?
When you have 16M subs but still want to get that Apple check...
Voice Isolation is not exclusive to iPhone 15, but is a feature of iOS 17 available on older models as well.
YOU CAN HOLD TTHE VOLUME DOWN BUTTON ON THE S23 TO TAKE A LOT OF SHOTS (i just realised this is all in caps lock ;-;)
8:21 did he just fucking rickroll us?!
Can’t wait to buy this 7 years in the future when I can actually afford it!
Someday my comment will also get famous😅😂😂
But for that cost ? Let’s keep it zoomed out lol
Cool!
I wish if you could be more honest and about apple strategy regarding reducing carbon footprint and every new IPhone come with minor changes which conduct to more waste of the planet resources and poeple money… maybe someday
waiting for s24 ultra, iphone 15 killer
4:42  cooling system 🤔 Does it affect screen brightness?
The math for the price was incorrect 😅
Best review I’ve seen until today 👍 well said 👏👏👏
keep up i always watch ur reviews before any uther
Most important thing is that you got paid bro.
Comparison 15 plus 15 pro
Mrwhosetheboss i just want to say  that if you want to gift it i am here for it , cause right now i don't have a phone ,so i would be glad if you have i any old iPhone you can gift them to me. PLEASE am so desperate cause here it too expensive.
Ppl’s watching this are trying to convince themselves that it’s worth it to buy the new iPhone. It’s not.
Maybe the 15 has features...you know like the immense electromagnetic field of the iPhone 12...in fact I'm sure you could cook popcorn with it.... Apple stole all their OS from others who gave it away free ..and bastardised it and then charged the masses ....
No fast charging sucks ..didnt speed up wirless charging sux!!!
Ive had voice isolation for at least 1 year on the iphone 🤷‍♀️
as someone that buys iphone once a three years im very happy with the 15
The price gap between 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max is not $100 but $200!! Therefore the gap in price is double from what you say in the video!!!
Excellent review and can relate to the points you raised! So true about the Live Photo/Portrait pics .. feels like a game changer .. agree the Live Photos are great for reels 🙌
wallpaper iphone 15 pls
Whatever be the case, a 14 pro/max need not upgrade.
stop jumping on the seat in the beginning of each video,
Finally found a youtuber supporting iphone 15 series ❤
The F will also pop up when I'm sold false hopes
He is paid by apple. Sony and asus had it for long time
This is a solid review.❤
Thanks!
"A sub to the channel would be mega pixtastic" i thought he was going to say 😅
Hate that they removed that silent toggle
Please make huawei p60 pro review please please please
why is so common to always turn on blue , wifi and date at the same time?
‏‪10:31Wow, it's very cool that the phone also saves the picture as a small video, what are you excited about, Samsung did it at least 5 years ago It's unreal how many people get excited about things Apple puts on their phones that other companies did a long time    ago‬‏   They say it's "the best iPhone we've made so far" some 40 times with every launch every year like what did you think we expected it to be the third best iPhone ever no so what do you say that and also the button on the side Samsung has had it for a long time and also the hole in the front screen Samsung did it in 2019
15:07  3x and 5x are exactly the same photo, but different background.
Callmeshazzam fans assemble
Excellent good fabulous speedy nice clever clean sharp love accent WoW bright intellectual cheeky solid 360 thoughtful brain storming forward looking analytical critical practical and the list goes on. THANK YOU just pressed like.   so you should
So its basically iphone 14 with a Type C in 2023 as a feature 😂 Nice promotion video.
but voice isolation was in 14 pros too .. even before the iphone 15, although maybe not as good as 15 ..
So you can zoom with the volume buttons instead of just taking photo
this video is actually painful right from the start for some android fans  😂 😂
Where is the innovation that apple is mostly known for apple will die soon its coming just like blackberry  and more
imagine having an iphone when samsung exists
I’ve been watching dozens of these reviews, even though I know for a fact it’s a MASSIVE upgrade from my IPhone SE 2020
zooming out a little...
the camera button thing is such a cope, i can double press my lock button and go instantly into the camera and use volune buttons to take the pic on my s21 ultra.  the game bit, isnt this just running the game on the cloud? you are just watching an interactable video. even my old phone can do that what the hell  the picture mini videos bit, again my s21 ultra can do everything
I like that clip because your team hard work for this video ❤❤  be honest I not surprised with that review 🤢
You just described the Iphone 14 pro Max with better words than last year!
Why I m watching this i can't even afford a iPhone 6😂
Poda pottaaaaa😂😂
How much do these companies pay you to make these sort of videos. Where is the criticism for the lack of headphone jack, Dual physical sim, Charging Adapter in the box etc. Now it's more like companies dictate what we want rather than we deciding what we want. Of all the things how can you possibly justify the price of the phone with minimum change.
I’m confused. I’m pretty sure you can only mail accessibility shortcuts to the power button.. not sure what you’re talking about.
This new gaming thing has been available I can play gta on my 13 pro with Xbox cloud play and it looks good
Is this a review or a sponsored video from Apple?
I feel like buying one but I do not have money to buy some
Why are you talking about the hardware problem after the software updation..?!
15 IS BORING THATS IT
which chair do you use? i like the bouncing effect. :P
Seems like a paid review
I've tried it irl. Overall barely any noticeable improvement. I only get to try the pro max ver but believe the regular 15 still uses the 60hz display which is bs. Even a cheap midrange android phones use 90hz as standard nowadays. You also won't notice the performance difference at all compared to 14 pro. I mean, if you're into gaming then just buy a cheaper but more powerful gaming phone instead. Don't buy this crap unless you're an iSheep or you just have too much money somehow.
Nothing is Ground Breaking in 15 Series except Price... Very Simple... Upgrade or No... Answer is No... Bring Better next time.. Bye for now Apple.
Thanks for the new portion of the marketing garbage. Hoping for real review soon, and comparison with S24 Ultra.
Pardon me but I did NOT know my iPhone 11 Pro max had the back tap feature 💀 I didn’t even know that was a thing😭
Samsung introduced motion photos before 2019
nothing phone CEO give I think right answer iPhone 15 totally board waste of money that's it 😑
L
Oh yeah its better 😂 u play better games 😂..... sorry we don't play video games...
The pro max starts at the equivalent of 1630 dollars here in Sweden, while the regular Iphone 15 starts at 1088 dollars. ☠️
guys, I swear we added a new color and its 1.645% faster! i's absolutely worth the price tag we're slapping on it!
6:45 is this how they say it there??
The amount of PEOPLE LOVE HIM HE IS ON TRENDING🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
be honest apple copy Samsung one feature in new model and we use that feature since Samsung s5 came out I not surprise with that feature 😑
When is the wedding
Actually the Prices here in Germany dropped by almost 100€ because Apple sells the 15 pro max 256GB version for the same price as the 14 pro max 128GB version
How you play that can you do that to 14 pro max
I find the totally rounded sides of the X era phones rather easy to drop. It’s a very slippery design IMO
Just unsubscribed cuz after a few weeks he will be like why the OnePlus pro beats iphone 15 dudes just making videos for the sake of it
What a shamefull iphone 15 same model.. same innovation last year… nothing new 😅 android phones are 5 year advance…and good features ,better camera . Better zoom.. better type c fast charging.. all flagship phones 120 hz refresh rate
All those animations and they couldn't expose your face properly? lol
hey man r u ok....? .......idk why i felt that you r not ok..........!
Voice isolation is also in 14 pro ios 17 🤡
This video was sponsored by Apple 🤡
Who did the unboxing
You can play console game or no
Alright uve convinced me. it's time to get the 14 pro.            wait wait wait, they actually fixed the HDR??? okay I may really be interested.
it being simmilar to the last phone reminds me of iphone 13.12.11
As someone with iphone 11pro, i see this as absolute win
You didn't waste time to change from Samsung back to Apple😂😂
Its not its just same sht
Seriously its boring 😅
7:12 😂😂😂
Wat if you charge a iPhone 15 with a iPhone 15
Love how he’s playing the iPhone 15 pro on Milo is funny to me
The wallpaper on the 15 Pros is really cool. Can anybody share the link to these wallpapers?
Take a drink everytime The Boss makes the OK hand sign 🍺👌🏻
What's different between pro and pro max
Samsung’s button in the middle of the phone is almost always pressed just by picking the phone up from a table. The middle of the phone is a horrible spot for buttons
What's the best money for value iPhone 15 ?
I just realised there is a back feature...
@Arun......Im currently using the S23U from January this year and came from the Iphone 13PM. Do you think its worth me moving over to the Iphone 15PM?  Im not fussed about ecosystem and all of that, nor the going ons with the cameras. All i want is a phone that is fast in performance, great screen and will last me 3-5 years with no worrys about performance. Not had a Samsung before this one and just worried it start to go wrong sooner then an Apple would. Help! Or anyone 😊
Yo
Still there is no fast charging 😂😂😂 , reverse charging 😂 multitasking 😂, charger in the box 😂, and the latest feature are 4 Year before technology. There is nothing new brother. Open your eyes 👀 and look at the phone 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
When you talk about the battery, you are saying the same thing over and over again.
My old Huawei P10 plus has those motion photo & portrait tweak adjustment after taking a photo 😆 if u have a p10 plus go check it out
Something to note with the gaming side is now that it's USB-C you can seamlessly Mirror with ease the phone to the TV. With I assume 0 lag and phone constantly charging.
Is it just me or does all the studio shots look weird 🤔
I really don't know why no one is speaking about the display issue on iPhone 13 Pro series and 14 Pro series after the update. No major tech channels have posted any content about it.
Great video  Also you brought back some memories with Assassins Creed Bloodlines on PSP, played it a lot
plz give me one bro plz plz plz
I WANT TO BUY A MOBILE IN PAKISTAN SO WHICH COMPANY?
This is the best review of this iPhone I've seen so far :)
The portrait mode thing where you can adjust the portrait after ahot has been available on android since 2020 xiaomi had it and pixel did too
After the iPhone 12 was released, Apple did not make much of a difference in appearance. The look of the iPhone has been the same since the iPhone 12.
All software basically youre paying for software now
18:30 it's going up by 200, not 100
3:38  “that’s crazy”   iPhone 15 in a nutshell
Fix your camera setting and lighting. Your face is always looks like oily and over expose in every video you have.
Biggest fan from Pakistan 🇵🇰😊
People are still using X?
Can some😢😢😢get me any iPhone
why on eu the prices are bad xD 1200 for the pro only xD and not the pro max
hi
It's crazy how much cheaper the iPhone is over there. A galaxy s23 256gb ultra is 860,- euro here and iPhone 15  pro max 256gb is 1650.- euro its almost a 1000 euro differents, insane markup in Europe market
hi
Are you telling me you'll get better images by being far away and zooming in before taking the photo, rather than taking it normally with 1x??
The review makes no sense.
Where can i get that wallpaper on your thumbnail image?@
The feature which you can add potrait mode after, Vivo had this long time agoo!!!
Great review - 16.4 million subscribers thats insane.
so it's true iphone will run resident evil 720p with low mid settings nothing new
I swear apple think everyone is a pro photographer or wants to be. The camera is fine in all these phones. We don't need better cameras we want things that are functional and phones that don't look exactly like the last. So boring 😴
always loving the reviews 🔥
Does Aron still workout
Great video, but skip the background music pls. Really annoying to hear while you talk..
if it still cant record video in 8k then it is still worst in 2023-2024
Hey @mrwhosetheboss can you please sponsor me or gift me an Iphone 15 pro max as it is my dream to hold and own that phone since so long,it is just a very humble request,if you can do this for me,I will be indebted to you for life
Now Arun have to send me an iPhone15proMax. 'cause he made me fall in love with the phone but my pocket is shallow!!!
You've always been able to use the volume button as a shutter.
After my experience with iPhone 14 PRO MAX , all I'll say is Never Again or over my dead body.
Just saying: triple press makes double press slower
No one is talking about the action mode on the video camera system? Is there no improvement?
he got paid
You're the quintessential Apple Fanboy
Talking about gaming... how does it handle the dimming issue? The latest ones had quite a hard time with its screen when it got overheated
IPhone fan boy
how different is it from the non pro model?
He looks Bhartiya🇳🇪🇳🇪🇳🇪
oh wow a camera button like a real camera, something sony has had for what 16 years now. Have fun with the USB 2.0 on a 900 dollar phone though. Oh yay coating on a lens for lens flare, vivo since 2019.  Focus shift post clicking in android since 2017ish. So all in all, NOTHING is great, but above average sum of its parts. Slow clap apple, slow clap.
There's no feature on a phone I despise more than voice notes.
Omgeee I didn’t know the back tap button activates the flash
"All about having to think, it's just gone now"
now we waiting for a battery test
I would love to hear ur thoughts on the mate 60 pro situation, are we going to have Chinese chips in our phones in 5 years time?
What a G for using a controller on the phone games. That’s exactly how I am if games do not support controllers I am out instantly no point in even attempting modern games with touch screen controls
what a journey i still remember the day i switched from a lumia 800 to an iPhone 6
Waiting for battery drain and drop test 🤣
How you DL the games on the phone ?! From App Store ?!
Im sure u can get ur hands on a mate 60 pro so why haven't u done it yet ? it can be the most interesting and controversial phone in the years to come.
''the fact that you can play the game on a system so small is amazing'' yeah sure but its expensive as hell, i bought my laptop for less than that and its more powerful
All these tech review guys are all saying the same things..trying to muster some positives from a company that have them all doing their bidding.. these guys are paid mouth pieces for the wealthy tax dodging companies..
It’s been this way for regular people for several years. We don’t care that much honestly I just upgrade once every 5 years  so I just get the best that’s around
How can i get that wallpaper??
Global IQ test. Do you have iphone 11 12 13 or maybe 14? And this year will you buy 15? If your answer is yes i have a bad news for you.
Nice 👍
Why is he holding the phone upside down at 0:35
Still waiting for Call Recording.......
Arun is trying so hard to sell this NEW phone...
When are you reviewing the mate 60
I can take motion photos on my S7 Edge from 2016... Revolutionary :lol:
Great Video!
Amazing review so crisp 😌
lol
19 minutes of nothing new
No doubt iPhone 11 was a much better design than the squared off 15. 11 was better to grip.
Fanboy and baised 😂😂😂😂😂
Next level
Hahaha MegaPixel Really?????????????
We have always had the voice isolation
Im pissed off not getting natural titanium i had it ordered and everything and chickened out for the black 😂
the iPhone 15 has USB-C 2.0 instad the 3.0
Wow your fiance is so beautiful
It's seems better since the previous one is bad
Could anyone tell me where to get that gorgeous wallpaper from? Thanks in advance!!
I just liked this noise cancellation thing but sorry can't afford it
Arun, it would be great if you could share a Drive with links to the original photos so that we can see them closer and compare them.
Bro you ate already sold to iphone
Iphones are for grandpas who only need to press 2 buttons. One to turn the screen on and the second to hit call.  Iphone was terrible compared to Android even back when I was in middle school. Part of the selling point for this one is its made with "space grade" titanium lololololiooll. Thats how pathetic and desperate apple is. Iphone users still bending over to get dished every single year lol its hilarious
I bet the iphone 17 and 19 will have at least a 4 inch wide camera set up
I think Samsung have something like voice focus in some of the models.
How many apple stickers have you collected after all of the iphon unboxing?
They look like they copy the pixel phones image processing, it looks more contrasty than ever
Wallpaper name or link? Purple one
For some reason,  this  video reminded me of Stockholm Syndrome. Love your video BTW.
Apple peddling the same phone for years 😂
wow, re-focus after taking a normal photo... that's cool!!   BTW, anyone remember Lumia Refocus app on windows phone? kinda reminds me of that but this implementation is better-er.   (●'◡'●)
Ok 🚶
Which wallpaper are you using? (minute 1:22)
how much did apple paid you for this video?
Don't trust this guy and marquees for any Apple reviewers.  After Tom Cook giving a shout out to Marquees,  Arun not wants that too.  Image he is telling you even what Apple didn't mention and flaunt
I m not sure if u would be reading the comments though , but just to spot this one out … the price difference between both phones are 200 dollars and not 100 dollars 👍
Voice isolation was already there in iPhone science long.  Even it works very well on my iPhone xr
"from pretty but very heavy to a set of phones ...much lighter"  1 gram difference that's so light
I have an iPhone XS Max and it has voice isolation mode so it’s not a new feature
in Italy it costs even 100eur less :)
Great video 🎉 thank you very much
Paid review
Thanks for the ad after that "megapixel" joke Arun, really needed a breather after that😭😂
Wait a second, my iphone xr has the voice isolation mode too
Awesome
huawei mate 60 pro the best smart phone ever made so far period.
Samsung 23 ultra vs iphone 15 pro max
I really love how you use milo (4:53) to mount the 15 pro  😂
THey added usb C because they were forced to do it...
Best trashpple to hold is obviously the 4s and 5s 👀
your iPhone vs samsung camera test video is most awaited video of the year because no one can do it like you. love all the your works ❤
Wait I have been using voice isolation for so many days with my 12 pro max
Only 4 current games 😂😂😂 Android apkbtch pls 😂😂
Is apple trying to sneak into gaming scene?
The charging cable is just like the iPad 10
When did Apple start giving reviewers iPhones early?
This entire video was to flex on us with your fiancée, 😂👍🏾👍🏾 More power to you🎉
Voice isolation is pretty much the only solid improvement on the phone as a regular user, not a gadget geeks opinion. Let's wait for what Samsung is still hiding, if any.
The most detailed and modest review. Like your work. 👍
I am gonna go crazy with this camera on this phone. The 13 pro max has been extremely good but the 15 pro max is gonna be insane.
You okay there Arun? You don’t seem okay health wise.
Do the iPhone 11s also have the back tap feature?
As an iPhone 14 pro user, I have to say the only thing making me remotely want to upgrade to the 15 pro is the reduced weight, and based on that alone I can’t justify the cost. Like a lot of people feel nothing is very exiting about this new lineup. So it’s a skip from me until next year…maybe
That smile on aruns face when he flipped the iPhone , my mans worried his about to pull of a Linus
The newest Comments are pure gold 😂
i still don’t understand did nobody know about the voice isolation back when the iphone 11 came out i’ve been using that since
These days its very hard to find true tech reviewer , in initial days he was loyal to his followers base , it all about money.  How can you support a shitty phone , because of you lots of people get influenced and apple will make money on shitty phones and apple wont be motivated to make innovative products just a shame to see you go like this.  Unsubscribing you. 😢 Please be loyal and true your followers
Does anyone have the wallpaper from the phone in the thumbnail?
Does this new iPhone 15 Pro or Max have an extra option that defines the Pro of the cameras ? Or a Pro Manual option in the camera ?  Is Safari still lovering the videos to 360p in automatic ? (on youtube) Did Apple resolve the Bluetooth low quality sound for Bluetooth speakers ? When will they ad 4K 120 fps ?
And I'm actually gonna miss it cause these are the only review videos that I look forward to watching
😂😂😂😂😂RADIATION 😂😂😂😂😂😂
There should be an actual apple competitor which runs on ios. Ik its not possible but still it'll help consumers, just like we all get various options on Android. 🤣💀
I'm actually extremely sad because this is gonna be the last Mrwhosetheboss video that I'm going to watch since my phone's gonna break in a week or two😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Seems like a paid promo… you are hit because you gave honest opinions… things are drifting, check yourself
Nice one.  Thanks for sharing.
Just too good! Jeep it up, Arun!
Does it still have a back button that jumps all around
Once again an iphone fan review... The reality is that iphone has nothing new to offer.
Going from my 12 pro Max 512gb to 15 pro max 1tb
Resting the phone on the poor cat 😅😅😅 lol
I love watching phones that I cant afford🤩🤩
Overall smartphones are boring nowadays
Samsung had most all that years ago already...
oh oh, someone doesnt understand photography... its still a 12 MP image just upscaled to 24MP and the 120mm lense is actually a 120 f21, yes garbage. apple is flat out lying about the cameras.
The only competitor to Apple is actually Apple😅
😂😂😂😂😂
Hats off from android user
Next level 😂😂😂😂
The voice isolation was there for ages..u just didnt notice it lol
Patiently waiting for the samsung galaxy s24 ultra...
12:47 Look at that difference in Background!😱
Which ear pods were those? Any idea anyone?
This is the best review I saw for this phone
I also cost 1000 dollars
here in sweden irs sadly around 1700 us dollars for promax..
Can you buy me a phone please?
How much do they pay you? Because there is no difference at all, I don trust any more in iPhone camera, I have the 14 pro, and not only me but all my friends that have it find it disappointed because of the photos, the video is really good, expect doesn’t do focus. I m pretty sure the problem is the new sensor and all procesador, made for less sharped images. The color of the skin are really really bad, with a magent looks, the cinematic and portrait mode change completely the colors of a normal picture. Well I just see numbers in your video just like Apple does, 3x faster, 5 times better, and the reality is very different .
ДЯкую
Bro you didn't tell about that we can transfer the video data at the same while while shooting the video by attaching SSD by Type C cable
Talk about the greenline and white screen issues on smartphones please
I am amazed how many people have the sheep mentality and buy overpriced iShits from crapple that sell phones with 60Hz displays and we are almost 2024. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️👀🧠
iphone 15 is a joke.
999 to 1199 is 100 up?
Imagine buying an iPhone 15 pro just to experience ray tracing, instead of buying a PS5 and a 4K TV 💀
Its just a camera update
Thanks Arun you give us honest review ❤
Flip 5 be like :-   Wtf
How much did apple pay you to make this video? 99% of what you mentioned are on the 14 pro max
Still not worth 1000 dollars
WHAAAAAT IT GOES ON SALE ONLY ON SEPTEMBER 22???!!!
9:27 turn off the motion picture in samsung to speed the shutter even more Edit: Mega Pixel lmao please also compare with pixel
iPhone 15 Pro Max sold out all over the world. It can’t be that bad.
iOS 17 has removed the vibrate on silent button in the settings. I’ve used this since 2007. Every bed time my slider goes onto silent and I turn off vibration in the settings. Has it moved somewhere? Can anybody help?
Voice isolation feature was part of ios16
S23 ultra vs iPhone 15 pro - which one has better upload quality to socials?
Not useful 😢
Not an x. The 5x zoom uses the multiplication symbol. Not an x, it’s the symbol used to represent multiplication. Ie. five times zoom, not five ex zoom.
Apple : we are launching the same phone for the 4th - 5th time ; how do we fool people ? Youtubers : dont worry boss… leave it to us….
All the sheep can't wait to spend thier money
Iphone 15 to 14 is what the S23 was to S22. Same design, but big changes inside.
CANT WAIT FOR UR BATTERY TEST
Good video nice time
I phone 13 pro feels like mi 13 ultra
what if you charge ur iphone by a samsung via wireless charging and u charge the same samsung by that same iphone via cable
Watching things I can’t afford🥲 still manifesting🙏🏻😭🤞🏻
I wonder if ever get to a point where the same games that are on consoles will run natively on average phones(lower resolution and settings of course). And also sharing the same accounts so you wont have to buy it separately for phone and console/pc. For example lets say you own a game on steam/epic/ps store and you can have that app on phone and running the same games you own. If that ever happens it will pretty much kill gaming handhelds.
I want samsung galaxy 23 pro max vs iPhone 15 pro max
Best phone now is the z fold 5 no comparison This is almost the same phone Samsung is in another league 😂😂😂
4:53 the input lag is crazy
So he is a nerd and uses voice massages. This woman transformed you!
I don’t think it’s that serious about a phone camera
Giveaway?
I hope the 16 at least makes it more dumb with a 4th camera or make a gigantic camera that is one that looks cool
All of these differences , however the human eye cannot detect it , all iPhones are fast and all iPhones have a pretty good camera !!!, u can’t tell a difference , I don’t care what the tech guys say
Liging sims odd in this video today your face looks bit off
7:50 wtf 😭😭
You finally got bribed by Apple to lie to us?
But not worth for a kidney😂
2 days to go 🥹
Everything you said is about software, so lot of old iphone will have the same feature soon.. So there is nothing about iphone 15 pro..!!
4:42  only for gamere 😎
APPLE DESIGN TEAM NEEDS TO BE SACKED...I THINK WE AS THE PUBLIC HAD ENOUGH OF THE SAME DESIGN LAST 5 YEARS.  NEW DESIGN PLEASE APPLE 🤬
You get paid to say these things bro, no one cares that your iPhone 15 is 1% better than an iPhone 14 or even 13 for that matter
Voice isolation isn’t a new thing though?
What wallpaper is that??
Anything new that haven't been on Android for years
6:25, is certainly a unique choice of words. You thought I wouldn't notice but I did.
Mr., I have a question? Can you gift me the IPhone 14 Pro that you use to use? I will like to give it has a gift to my fiancé, please let me know if you see this
15:48  why would u take a pic at 4.9x if u have 5x optical.
Can you give me your old iPhone 14 phone to me, while you are shifting to the new iPhone 15...
Watching this with my iPhone 4s 😅
Finally apple is a corrupt company .
I can't wait to see the moon zoom
I would still chose s24 ultra
Best color for 15 Pro Max?
either he stayed up till midnight or he changed the time in the thumbnail
becoming more android 😂
Still worst than s23 ultra
Voice insolation works perfectly on my Iphone 12 pro max. Just make sure you have the latest software updated
Why so long video
To me the best feature is you can connect an external hard drive to the iPhone. Videos shot from the iPhone can be saved on the hard drive directly, and videos from your hard drive can be uploaded and posted via iPhone without a computer and Wi-Fi.
Oh drat ! This is you taking a bend over Apple. This iphone 15 does not have anything new, just the company creates some dumb hype and gets users excited for it only for them to get manipulated psychologically to believe it has some new features. Lame, stupid and over pricey even when the manufacturing costs is substantially low.
Everytime you came up with something to say about a sub to a channel just forced me to like the video!
Wait….. SIM EJECTORS?!?
Very nice video
usb 2.0...
CORRECTION NEEDED: 18:26 and 18:49 -- The difference between $999 and $1199 is $200; not $100 as Arun mentioned!
Yeah I don't see this gen selling as well as iphone 14 pro max did but it will sell ok... People who bought the iphone 14 pro max aren't going to buy this but will wait till next year to upgrade which is fair cause only if ur rich u upgrade every year😂😂😂 it's a waste to me actually lol... U get better upgrade when u wait 2yrs plus battery degration happens after 2yrs but it's very small u won't see it until the 3rd year lol ... I'm ready to upgrade because of USB C and I'm just waiting in battery life test... If this phone does better than last year's  model I'm saving money for December n buying it
This is the best review video I’ve seen so far, actually giving more in depth information that’s not generic and regurgitated! Thanks!
Hii I'm from the Philippines where poor and can't afford that phone can you help me to afford that please
I've got voice isolation on my iPhone 11, it's not a new feature
This video is brought to you by Tim Cook.
Can u give me your 14 pro max am using a iPhone 6😢
You're biased opinion doesn't matter
So resuming: New charger, new action button and other minor software/hardware/camera changes.
Your advertisement to 15 pro is too much than apple.. So bad man, you should bash apple for not inventing anything and fooling customers
I didnt even know about the reverse charging to another iPhone, great vid
apple keeps playing with the market as they like and people will just be there to buy whatever they make
Love that new simple packaging design to peel off the two tabs
We can use the volume button as a shutter button too... action button is not that impressive
RelaxingEnd reference!?
*ولكم* *شنو* *هالجمال* 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tiltle.....No.
Casually showing the gold ps5 really fits the description of the channel's name xD
2:46 this information is wrong. Not EVERY iPhone has the back tap feature. It’s every iPhone that’s the iPhone 8 or later.
Yo can i have the extra iphone 15 pro or your old iphone 14 pro max
How did he get it before 22nd?
Remember The camera system technically would not be possible unless it is from Sony, which it is.?
Summary: simply not worth it, was thinking to switch from previous model to 15 can’t see any point even colours are more faded than ever!
mega pixel 😂
S23 ultra  oR 15 Pro?
Nice how he "forgot" to mention how long he can game on the phone, while calling out the ally for it's 2h battery life...
Where can I get that wallpaper?
Apple is misleading about Iphone 15 pro. it is only cropping. reducering image quality😮
Never have i seen any youtuber saying anything wrong about iPhone 😂 i mean they launched c type in 2023 and still people are going crazy imagine if any other Android would have done the same thing they would have been trolled like hell. I'm not saying iPhone is bad its best but it should he worth the upgrade
done watching the review now time to cry with my MI phone
I need that wallpaper!
Same old shit
I've not owned an iPhone in 10 years, I like the suddle yet elegant colors 🤷🏾
That Lock Screen wallpaper looks sick! Source?
Why didn't you make a video on the iPhone green screen problem after the update, despite making a video on the Samsung battery bulge?
iPhone 14.2 pro should be the name. Almost identical device to the predecessor...
That “out of reach” criticism is so disingenuous. If you can’t reach that side of the phone how you reaching the top of the screen? Also no one hold there phone directly from the bottom. That’s an easy way to drop your phone. People hold it from the side of the phone. Reaching the button isn’t a big deal. Especially if you know you have small hands and bought a pro max
GREAT review! You got a new subscriber! Would you be so kind as I share your wallet paper? The purple/bluish star one?
iPhone 15 is out?!!!!!😭😭😭
He used gloves to unbox the iPhone wow   all that money for a 60 hz screen maybe you should use gloves
the probleme with these tech reviews now days after watching bunch of them i feel like they are beeing paid under the table now way that he can realize that most of thing that was mentioned here are a software upgrade can be added to iphone X and not even the 14 : the title is misleading is promoting a product that offer nothing new really 1/ changing the side button and called action and adding some fuature to it (those fuature can be added without changing the button it self) 2/ the iphone proccessor is powerful as they claimed sound and phone call quality and voice isolation are thing that tottaly depended on the proccesor and it can be added via a software update not buy purchasing new phone  ect .....
nobody cares about the colours because everyone puts a phonecase over it
Again... seems like paid advertisement and propaganda... so sad, cause I used to like your videos
We want another video about Huawei being back with its 5G fully Chinese made phone
3:29 I’ve had voice isolation on the 13 pro since last year
Better, they have same design like iPhone 11 pro, look huawei they have better camera system then iPhone,samsung, they have tof 3d as well as fingerprint scanner and most importantly satellite calling
These phones must be so great and such an upgrade that you decided to bring up Live Photo’s which have been on the iPhones for years already. Sell out
The way you are praising this iPhone and mentioning every little improvement and showing great impact of that little improvement. You can praise anything withthis attitude.
Xiaomi doesn't get enough credit for the curved edges apple obviously copied that from Xiaomi 13 series
The Pro and Pro Max should always have the exact same specs. What if you don't want a tablet sized phone but feel like you're missing out if you buy the smaller phone. Hated it in the 12 series. Apple is one arrogant company. They never give you what YOU WANT.
Its All about to USD, from iPhone to Mrwhosetheboss :)  btw, im getting mine in sept 22nd.
How do you play resident evil in iPhone how can I download it ?
Can we talk about how Apple doesn't want to resolve the lens flare issue? Saw the review from Marques Brownlee, night photography will cause problems, so many dots everywhere when standing near a source of light.
How I wish I could have one of these 😢😢😢😢😢
NO, no curved phones anymore for the love of everything
Please share the link to the wallpaper you have used
18:55 its 200 dollarydoos
How did u play resident evil on a Phone
I have iPhone 13 Pro Max and I have been using this voice isolation feature for at least last 6 months so how this feature is new to iPhone 15 pro max. I think feature is not new but you came to know about it recently 😊
I will still not buy iphone.
0:13 its that Mia Khalifa
Make a Video about one ui 6, if you are a unbiased tech reviewer!
Apple sucks lol
Sounds like an “Apple-polisher” - pun intended. A more independent review was what I was looking for. Not a hagiography that looks for reasons to unconditionally sing Apple’s praise.  It’s an expensive phone for which a purchase of I’d like to be careful.
if i get 1k like Mrwhosetheboss will send me a gift 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I started hating u when u switched to iPhone I was like how this man switched what happened 🤬😊🙀
great console gaming, but battery ??
it seems iphone has become pixel in term of camera
its just the same boring phone
48 mega pixel of iphone is different from 200MP of android😂
AYOOO CHIIILLL
fun fact : this variable focus mode and HEIF format was introduced long ago  by Xiaomi mi 11T pro launched 3 yrs ago i believe  and every xiaomi phone since then  has it already apple added another layer on top to refocus subject .
7:51 is just weird
You should check the pro and pro max for overheating... Petapixel had issues with that while recording on the pro and pro max.
apple - LOL
I literally got a iPhone 15 ad
The price difference between Pro and Pro Max is NOT "an extra 100 dollars", it is 200 USD...
The most boring phones on the planet...
Big tech reviewers are always making apple products seem amazing even though their upgrades are minimal. But are very quick to bash on any other products from other brands for doing the same thing.
they shouldn hadware differentiate
Port less can be achieve by magnetic dock like the charging dock of a macbook
Where's can I get that wallpaper
The action button is perfect, but im a lefty lol
Dee Dee Burmese Vlog are you there?
Me watching the video without having a plan to ever buy the phone...
These always make me so jealous!
love you bro, but as far as am concerned thats Iphone 12 3rd edition
Wallpaper please ?! Thank you
If they could have just put a 48 MP on the 5x they could have said they had a 240mm lens 😂
I’m the only one who thought your nails are painted white? 😂
Love the new iPhone, too bad I was never able to afford one 😅.
Wait... the included cable does not allow for USB 3 speeds?  I am literally gonna remove this trash from my shopping cart, wtf. Fk that shit.
I had one concern: why do largest tech youtubers like mrwhosetheboss and MKBHQ not talking about the green line issue that is happening in most of the phones which includes iphones too. Are they too afraid to talk about it or have they not faced any similar problems
Your videos are overr perfect ❤ love them
Nobody holds the phone in reverse landscape mode. In landscape mode, the two cameras will be on top, and your shortcut button will be on the bottom. Kinda stupid?
Make a iphone 15 pro max vs Samsung s23 ultra video please
The man did a better presentation than the entire apple people :D
I dont know why Apple didn't do a large ORANGE action button like the Ultra to keep same design language! anyway; any idea if a case manufacturer released a case that HIGHLIGHT the action button with a special colored case button? with a different texture?
I had no idea that there was a back-tap feature or that you can program things a triple-tap of the power button - so cool!
next level!?!?! what a hype beast. nothing is next level its the same phone but apple sheeps call it innovation smh type c
No it's not 🤮
Where can i download that wallpaper ? what's the name of it ^^
what a great review, incredible!
Imagine buying exactly the same phone you already have for another $1,199. You've already bought this new phone only based on the ''battery''. This youtube channel is a con artist? The worst waste of money!
10:33 I had no idea you can save live photos as a separate video… haha that is awesome thanks for the info!
All these things are sadly not noticeable for a average user 😅
This video is factual, but still copium as heck
Anyone know how i can get the resident evil on my phone?😢
Where do I get this wallpaper??
watching in iphone 11 pro 😢
How much did Apple paid you?
❤ 💯
get the iphone 15 pro max and then explode tons of tnt in minecraft until it crashes lol
I phone 15 pro max vs Samsung s24 ulta comparison video please
I am now tired of hearing the same thing from every youtuber.First people say it's dumb then praise the shit out of it.
So basically its nothing, “we are apple you are idiots” agenda
I phone 15 pro max vs Samsung s24 ulta comparison video please
Nothing spectacular just talking about cameras like it is not everyone that is a photographer. Apple needs a new team
wonderfull love the details
Using that button for snapping pics is not a good idea. But you know it yourself. Why are you glorifying it then?
Meh, not interested in sending my data to be harvested by apple or google. I will be going graphene
Bro calm down man.  Its the same phone as last year with few barely noticeable increments. Why are u so excited. Some one coming from iphone 11 pro may be able to appreciate the improvements not the ones having 13pro or 14pro
bro can i have your 14 pro if you arent going to use it anymore. I really need a better phone bro
It's only about camera .....that why girls like iPhone.....
This is by apple claims more powerful than a ps4 but it can't play game's at 60fps nor HD 1080p resolution like the ps4 and there's another factor battery life and heating cause the new A17 pro doesn't have a fan. the game mr beast shown were at so low graphics and low fps at peak performance that they can be considered water down versions technically since they not as good as the console versions. Maybe in 17 pro we might actually close the gap. But currently only the Nintendo switch is in trouble
I will buy this phone just for playing mobile legends
so this is sponsored video by apple ?
Me watching the video on my iPhone 8plain
Is it because it has type C charger that makes it better? Aside from few tricks added, the platforms esp. its materials and design is nothing but recycled old materials with boring designs for years. After 10 yrs will Apple release flips and fold series and still breakthrough  coz its Apple...No way!
So glad I waited for the 15
We lost MrBoss as well to Apple’s checks. Or he’s just jealous MKBHD just got mentioned by Apple. What a load of shill. It’s the same phone from three years ago with a better camera and “faster” chip. I’m an iphone user and frankly I’m not that daft to make a new purchase every year……….
nobody gonna talk about how he didnt rickroll us?
THANK YOU FOR THE VODAFONE UK AD😌
I am still using an iPhone 6.... running iOS 12
Wow you made 20 minutes video for a phone which has nothing new 🤣
It’s always the people who haven’t used an iPhone saying it’s the same. I use IP 13 and 15 already looks so much ahead of it in all aspects. Great phone
Is it a tech video or Romantic video 😅❤️
Too bad that ip15pro is pretty much…the 14pro with USB-C and action button instead of a mute toggle. Hopefully 16 will bring something new 🙏🏻
I don't use apple but do watch their release videos and this is a very minimal upgrade over the 14 series. Smartphones have hit a peak now where its hard to come up with something really special. Using galaxy s23 ultra and it's a great phone. S24 ultra will be very minimal changes over this.
Drop the gloves
This one didn’t even felt like a new iphone review video, just felt like you were less of words to convey in middle of the review
s23 is 👑
I want the ultrawide to get a 48mp and larger sensor.  It's still borderline unusable...
7:50 😂
So laaaaaammmeee
Well you should not compare it to the PS4 which is almost a decade old
999 to 1199 is a 200$ difference.
mid
I love the way you pay attention to small details ❤❤❤
i wonder if he has a collection of sim ejector tools.
pro max is not going up by a 100 its going up by 200 dollars
I have a 14pro so i can easily wait for the iPhone 16 or 17 i think 😅
Surely, the best iphone created. YET
like i knew aron was an apple boy .... but not to this degree , might as well praise for powering on god damn
I have got the 14 plus and now I think I may trade in for 15 pro max, also will you ever do your own merchandise? I love the shirt you got on in this video.
I’m still holding on to my iphone 11 should I get ip 15 or wait for the next?💀
Anyone a link for the wallpaper?
Where is the wallpaper from? Thanks
People paying for copy & paste products from samsung and apple cause huawei needed to be killed. sad!
When they launched iPhone 14pro max, they told us many things more than this. Well I still prefer my 14 pro max. I’m not upgrading until I see 16 or 17
the iphone video quality with prores and type-c is a killer combo
Apple Fanboy,.,
Playing console game on iphone. I hope it wont break you neck. Hahah
Yeah samar
Can the 15 pro play console games?
This is clear guys, iphone is BETTER THAN SCAMSUNG S23 ULTRA
Link to the thumbnail wallpaper?
noise isolation has been there for a while, maybe cuz I had the beta version, but its not just iPhone 15, its in all iPhone with new iOS
watching on my 5 years old Xperia 5 .
My ipad pro 11 m2 Has a 46k point gpu on geekbench 6  And 2600 single core cpu And 10k multi core cpu test   This seems to be much much stronger in general , so why the ps games comes only on iphone 15 pro while ipad pro m2 is more powerful
Have you ever witnessed an collage at work having to write a congratulation speech for the boss_? i get it new is better but man some tight squeeze s&^%$
Wow, I'm so impressed with the new IPhone after this video 🤯, not only did they added USB type C but also made some changes to the camera software, that's pure innovation and super awesome, they surely blew out the competition this time..! Totally, *NEXT LEVEL*  🤷🏽 🤷🏽
bro please make green screen issue faced by iphone 13 series 14 series as well software update and hardware issues related
the price difference is 200 $ not 100 $ between pro and pro max
Since you don't you  iphone 14 pro can you send it to me if uh dont mind😁
Hopefully, we can type and send Imessages while doing some other things like watching on YT like slideover in iPads
production quality of your videos is next level too! Nicely done
I am so satisfied on my 13 pro max i am using it 1 year already.. althou i have android phone buy i still like my iphone batteries is good 👍
Great review but I won't be trading up to it. Same ole same.. springs to mind re the APPEARANCE.. A key aspect of being an IPhone user was the distinct appearance against earlier ie Android phones etc BUT all we see over the last ten years if the same same same.. bar of course changing connectors, charging more well money wise.. and?? Also as you rightly point out! COLOURS?? Distinct styles.. nah this one is NOT for me.
You have god's talent ! <3
Thx for the back tap :D
Îs this the natural titan iphone or the white ?
Your videos are so much better than anyone else  review. Far better than even MKB. His presentation is so boring. You are like Joe Rogan Podcast and he is like Lex Fridman lol
I hoped apple would make the vanilla & plus at least have a 90hz display considering even a 100 dollar android phone got 120hz
WAIT DOESNT HAVE USB C  ore only in EU
How much you get from apple 🍎😅
I noticed that Motion Photo (Live photo) was active on Samsung while comparing the shutter speed in the video.
Wow, your Videos are so cool to watch! Keep the work up 🥳
Shame on you Mf
No wonder it's a paid review by Apple 😅😅
littlr things dont take a year to do for a company like this. lets just aknowledge employees got a nice holiday this time.  ( as an always been apple fan )
11:13 @Mrwhosetheboss 's face in the thumbnail 🤣
Live video was introduced in samsung i guess
I'm one of the biggest fans of this channel but this upgrade is absolute garbage.
Where do I get that purple/blue warp speed wallpaper?!?!
Unpopular Opinion: Smartphone SoC technology has reached its peak.
seeing Iphone 15 pro video on 1 side of my handfree of almost 0.3 euros 😂
Nahh the gigachad theme in between tho
U r jst an apple boy !! Apple tech is the tech of stone age android surpass apple decades in terms of tech
I don't think we can now compare the S23 Ultra with the iPhone 15 Pro. the s24 ultra would be suitable. which also could be nice if you can program the action button, imagine clicking 2x or 3x instead of the 1x click now.
I have an iPhone X Max  And I am still waiting for a phone that is worth Upgrading  I'll skip this for now
Your the guy that make me even consider getting the iphone 15
Really next level? 😂😂😂  Every year same shit.
This all sounds like cope. There are only so many wedding photographers you can have. Every iPhone fanboy I've talked to pretends to be shooting weddings every day for a living because they only talk about cameras like they're to die for. But the most that they do is share these photos in social media, which compresses those photos drastically into oblivion. Also, they ONLY use social media on their $1000-1500+ phones. That's a huge waste of money as $250 phones can also be used for scrolling social media (a devil's ploy) just as well and at 120Hz, though those Android phones can be used for waaaaaaaay more with sideloading, especially with an unlocked bootloader for advanced users.
16:08 had to like for that cringe moment
Nah bro, I’m not spending 1,000+
Bow much money 💰🤑 did Apple pay you
But latest iphone 15 do really lost its iconic 'Mute' button..That was one of Apple's trademark and it sad to see its no more.
DONT WASTE UR MONEY NO ONE CARES THAT YOU HAVE THE NEW IPHONE 😊
18:29 it is $200 more not $100 hehe
Not worth the upgrade
I had voice isolation in my iphone 12 before the release of 15
As expected, looking same as iPhone 13, just the features changed.
Hey arun, i have recently heard about kirin 9000s some people are calling it a breakthrough in semiconductor. And i am shocked you haven't made any video on it.
My phone and iPad both have the voice isolation, I don’t think it’s a new feature.
Thank you for the video !! Waiting for the comparison with the S23U 🔥
Honestly I just wish Apple instead allowed me to use 3rd party keyboards fully and add more than 3 languages. I keep struggling because I use 4 langauges daily, it really slows me down…
let's ducking talk, for 20min, about... nothing 😀
you only like xiaomi bruh.
VOTE FOR HINDI AUDIO.....❤
Oh wow! Iphone received something, which android users have had for years! How innovative! Pathetic....
Bro make your vedios carbon neutral yoo😁
The voice isolation mode is built in my Samsung since 2020.
Yeah you can play PS5 games on it, but for how long will the battery last?   If you can play on it for 15 mins max then it's not a big deal.
can i have you iPhone?
The video is sponsored by apple, i didn't know arun was this gullible
Android is better in every way
The real question is this. Even with the 15 being the new top dog. Is the iphone 13 mini still a worth while option?
Great review - and edit!
Endorsed by apple 🍏 🤣
Guess how old my Redmi Note 7
Golden ps5 be looking like Dr Fate's head
0:58 Sim ejector tool? I thought no more sim slots.
Wtf when did back gap happen I didn’t know about this
Love the vids! Also love the wallpapers!! could you link it up @Mrwhosetheboss <3
Nope. I'm not sold by this review. Even if I afford it, it cannot justify its price and I won't upgrade. I don't know why I feel that these youtubers are getting overexcited for this phone and try to sell it badly even if the upgrades are marginal. Sad.
MAza aagya❤
His wallpaper is so cool. Where can we get it?
Reviewers seem to always find so many little things to convince people to buy useless products
@mrwhosetheboss: I think you guys can give better ideas than Apple can themselves
You could do that for the pixel phone, where you could use the volume up button to take photos and some android phones let you use different button to take photos. So this is nothing new. But great review tho.
Is now a days youtubers job is to make people belive why they should buy sub standard products are overrrated price
Okay so this review pretty much only explained the camera improvements, little disappointed this time Arun
Best line of the video " how the whole thing works together as a system thats even better than the sum of its parts ". This is the line from 'Management Consulting' field.
My soul left my body when he flipped the phone in the air 🥲
Bro man got the gloves yall😂.
I like to watch such iPhones becuz I can't afford them 🤡🙃🔪
Sept 20
but i never hold phone like that when i take landscape photos lol it should be upside down...
Always great videos and entertaining as well as informative. I wish more people would use the HEIF and HEVC formats. I know a lot of people won't as it's Apple and I get people at work who can't open the files asking to send a jpeg instead. I'm sure jpeg started in 1998 so they're ok with tech advancing except in image formats.
Particularly loved this review. Wonderful job. ❤️💯
Most of these features have existed with Android for years. Apple just marketed it better as innovation😅😅
Discontinued headphones that come with the iPhone?
is it just a honest review or Sponsored Video...?
Apple fanboys sound more like apologists than fans these days!
You shouldn't put Apple on a pedestal for finally switching to USB-C. The whole world has evolved and done it years ago, and Apple wanted to stay different, but they were literally forced by EU
🐑🐑
Didn't even notice how beautiful those bezels are. Really hoping android phones get access to the tech soon.
Waiting for a Apple vs Samsung camera comparison.....
Do you guys market for Apple? Ask the question, why the same or higher price for minimal changes. Speak the truth
so the action button can only be setting for 1 purpose? not like 1 press for camera, 2 presses for silent?
I wonder why mrwhosetheboss haven't  mentioned about the display issues after iOS updates
I could never have the guts to toss and spin a 1000 dollar phone 😂  Respect to you brother 🫡
Oh, looks like you have received at last the Apple Payment.
I will stick to my 14 pro max! They are few minor upgrades . Will save me a grand!😊
What BS what they pay  you 😅 to sell it
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Beneficial experience, yes of course. Love iPhone 15 Pro Max
Wait a sec, I have a iPhone 14 Pro since last year and I’ve been using voice isolation since then. Tested it multiple times and it worked the same as shown here, what’s new? Do you mind doing a side by side shorts comparison?
Moral is the story you are a blind fan of Apple and you get paid by them It's really easy to understand bro so don’t do this and fouled people by this type of things
So you basically repeated what Apple presented in during the event.
Zooming out!
the problem I have encounter with iphone14 pro max. I got Wi-Fi 6 router on my house, but the iphone and macbook cant connect to my 5ghz network. Its always connected to 2.4 one, while all my other android phone, didnt have that problem. anyone have any idea what is happening?
Arun, could you please explain how you managed to obtain those iPhones in the UK, especially considering my earlier argument with the Apple specialist regarding UK delivery? I placed my order within a minute for delivery on the 22nd, so it would be helpful if you could clarify whether you acquired them from the US instead.
i desire a iphone 15 mini
Voice isolation is already on iPhone13. Thanks
I hate Samsung.  I hate Apple either.
Which smartphones have a 12 MP camera?  the very old ones or the ones that cost 10x less?
Iphones r 🚮😅😅😅😅
Aaaaaand the biggest improvement is.....TYPE C port!!!! 😆
this is so well explained WOAH, at first i didnt think much of the data is captured for camera mode, and switch around. But you giving those use cases really shined some light!
I'm switching from OnePlus 9 and i can't decide if I should go for the iPhone 15pro or 14pro
new by apple, not by competition... i just dont understand y people keep buying iphones
I can't afford shit if anyone wants to do charity please 😂
What concerns me about the console games is the battery health… what would happen to that lol
Can t wait you to post that battery test
I'm at the opposite spectrum :this is the less interested iPhone ever! 14 pro or even 13 pro is a hotter alternative!
Its not so good as Apple and influencers shows for you. There is micro updates. Think how these features feels on your daily use. And then you see there is so minor updates..
I have an iPhone 13 Pro Max and it was at 87% battery health yesterday, after I upgrade to iOS 17 the battery health went down to 83%… apple does that to force people to buy new phones
I am an Andriod user, and I don't think I'll move to Iphone in any near future, but your videos are very complete with info that I watch them just for fun.
15:19 man, u left your torch on 😂😂
Can i have your iphone 14?🙏
Does this Heif format open in any program or does it only work on Apple products?
Voice isolation feature is already present on iPhones it ain’t nothing new 🤷‍♂️
go easy on the music bro
I would say that action button will be only actually useful for left handers as we use our left hand to hold the phone plus left thumb to press those buttons on the left, that’s my opinion tho.
Thanks for this useful video Arun
Everything said in a British accent makes me think it's absolute truth 😂
A small thing i noticed difference between 15 pro and 15 pro max is USD 200 but i heard you say difference is USD 100.
Feels like another ad from apple advertising things they missed during launch.
So right now what are u doing with the old phone 😅
Sony already made an action button
Man, please respect the single  men and women in your fanbase. The fiancee part wasn't necessary!😅
That feint rick roll.. I had to go back to be sure 😂
you’re either drinking the apple kool aid too much or you’re falling for all their tricks😂
I’m not interested If I’m getting tech like 60hz in 2023😂.  I value my hard earned money. I remember using a 90 hz first back in 2020 maybe, and it felt phenomenal.
Regardless how much u sugar coat it its the same last year idk why reviewers try to make it something so different any power sharing to other stuff is old too
9:26 That one of speed taking pictures, we all know that Samsung is slower than anything else.
why dont we talk about software downgrade of images. i compared images i shot at the beggining of 11 pro and at the end and you can see the diference. is this leagal?
Type C is due to EU's law and not apple thinking about the future 🤣
Tuyệt vời
Arun finally told us whose the real boss is 😁 of the tech world ... its an 🍎😎   You deserved it Arun ...  Goodluck and Congratulations for ur engazement big dawg 👊🏽  ur one damn lucky bastard to be with her ... she seems a good women ☺️  Anyways ... congrats again yeah 😊
“This is by far the most advanced iPhone that we have ever made”……Tim Cook
Where's actual wireless powershare? Good God Apple lags on tech. 😢
In winter, you will be able to take photos without taking off your gloves, making it the best time to appreciate the action button.
1:24 Hey is that a sim card slot? I thought the iPhone 15 doesn't have that because of esim?
Voice isolation is present since iOS 15 and on iPhone XS and above. Why mention it specifically now?
idk bruh but the phonk music is kind of disturbing my ears
Apple 15 ,The latest garbage from apple.
The voice isolation feature is available on Samsung alos called voice focus
Please, what wallpaper are you using?
Sir want to sell iPhone 15, I need it. Please 😢
How much did Apple pay for this, because they botched their own showcase. :) Also, using the action button as a camera shutter, hmmmmm 🤔🤔 where did I see this before. Oh me dummy it was Sony on their Xperia, that had those, on the right side, as you mentioned below the Start button because it made more sense.
iPhone vs Pixel
apple paid arun well enough for this.....
I accidentally left my speed on 0.25x so I heard iiiiiiiiiiiffffffff yy-yyyyyoouuuuu zooooommmmm oooouttttt
gift me your 14 pro 😢
Does anyone know where he got the wallpaper of the phone in the thumbnail? If so can someone link it here pls
Why don't Android phones have live-photos like the iPhone has had for a few years now?
Crazy how far behind Apple is with their tech compared to Samsung.
So basically the improvement is the camera 😅
Hello im a student and I dont have any pc to use anymore cause my laptop is broken a few months ago but im still using it because cant afford to have and im a computer science student. If you can help me that would be super big help for my school.
Breh if only I could afford this...Phone literally cost 8000 bucks 😭
I'm samsung for the last 5 years I love this phone I can wait to have it 😊😊😊
I guess I am the only one who likes heavy phones. I am like, I am paying more. It should feel on my hand. If anyone other than me holding, they should feel the weight how much I paid 😊
Waiting for the battery comparison video ....
Voice isolation in FaceTime is not a new feature 🧐
Better to go with plus than falling for pro scam
Oversold. Samsung and Huawei had shortcut buttons forever. This is old old old crap. Stop selling so hard bro.
How much did they pay you to do a U-Turn on the pro? 😂
There's always a special joy in your heart whenever you're about giving your regular baised Apple product review😂😂
Voice isolation was already on the 14 pro max btw
Although Apple did an usually horrible prerecorded response this year! After work when I got home, I fast forwarded through all the BS, in less than 10 mins of viewing it was easy to see that the iPhone 15 pro max was a instant buy, especially with inflation, I knew 14 pro was an easy pass last year. Bye Bye lighting port you been a royal B!
Fancy
Motion photo has been on Samsung phones if my memory serves me right? 😒😒
Pretty phone shows fiance,pretty nice bro!!
You have a gf 😲
oh neat so they implemented the camera button from the xperia line and made it programmable.
Only 1 function at a time. So if i want to amke it silent immediate i have to go to settings
It's abysmal that almost half video is about Cameras. When it should be about battery and efficiency.
So basically m2 GPU cant even beat an 8 year old 1050Ti mobile😂😂 my laptop literally score more than 35K in stock mode and with single RAM stick.
it is like all the other generations 12,13,14 has nothing new but its new and amazing... because its an apple. so you've been paid by an apple that's Solid.
In iOS 17, I noticed that the default notification tone is changed to - rebound instead of tri-tone. And now, it is too quiet. I hope that they fix this in the upcoming build ASAP.
As for me, battery is the key feature. My 14 pro max still gets me 40ish hours on average, sometimes even 50. If the 15 pro max offers even better battery life with an even more consistant camera - I'm actually thinking about upgrading.
I need that wallpaper :)
Great review as always man.
This channel has become pretty forgettable with time, cant really keep up witth MKHB or Dave, in the whole year this is the only video that has been recommended to me by youtube pretty sad
Me watching all your videos without owning a single iPhone
Would you think it’s possible to get an emulator for a iPhone?
so whats new?
the iphone 16 going to get a better camera
I'm beginning you switch to iPhone to to attract more subscribers, which is working.......
seems like the voice isolation is late. s23 has that feature and it also applies to third-party apps
Why would I play resident evil or AC on a small screen. It’s a feature but useless. I would prefer more immersive content in a big screen. And don’t dance too much while reviewing. Doesn’t make u look cool. C.
Arun, please include Xiaomi's 13 Pro in the camera comparison too.  And get ready to be Surprised.
Can you buy it now
I'm excited for the iPhone 25 pro plus, I hope they can change everything without changing the outer design of an actual iphone.
thanks for the back tap 😂😂 i didn’t know it until u showed me
Can you share the wallpaper? Thanks
Blah blah blah 😅still same with my 14 pro max only charger difference the reason to change 😅😅but will switch
Its trash and its the same old iphone. Sony Xperia is the best dont believe this guy.
Where's the innovation in design and other things.... It's a 5 year old phone design by world biggest phone company
lol its nice to know when you spend all that money that at least its better than you think
Does it have fake 5g? Test it if it goes up to at least 300mbps
IM FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW I GOT A OPERA MRWHOSETHEBOSS  AD IN THIS VIDEO NO JOKE!
???? Why, why are you not tells about apple screen problem, or you getting anything from apple?
i love you arun but that "1000 lenses" comments just proved you don't know shit about type of camera lenses 😭
It's extremely sad that well established youtubers also need to toe the line when it comes to apple & iphones. They only talk about the positives and improvements, but never say a word of positive critique. Let's just start being real and objective. If Apple is being lame by not increasing the charging speeds, or finally converting to usbc at the behest of EU regulations (while still not acknowledging the consumer benefit), or providing the slow usb 2.0 cable in the box, then these issues should be addressed and called-out openly. When Arun mentions these in a passing and brushes them under the carpet, it takes away from his credibility.  I hope such youtubers realize this soon and drive fair assessments without fear of retribution from Apple PR teams.  Overall, keep up the good work Arun
HEIF is nothing special. My Xiaomi 12 Pro already does it. And yes it's fantastic.
When is the new rog mobile phone going to be announced😢😢😢
And this year too, Apple failed to solve the problem of the burned-out sky. The camera is that good :) Marketing bullshit at its best.
So the best thing they added was the same features my S10+ had 4 years ago? 😮
4:55 Did this man just use his cat as a phone stand? 😂😂
Bro there's nothing like next level except the ray tracing come on be honest, i mean we know you are an apple fan but next level seriously??
You are saying Apple has brought features like charging other phone with usb cable, which is a feature Android phones are having for years now, shows that how much Apple pays you for the review. And you haven't even addressed the SAR value issue with IPhone 12 yet, it's been more than 3 years since the phone released and all this time it had a SAR value of 5.74 (below 1.6 is normal above 2.0 is harmful for humans at cellular level.) and we only got to know about it when countries like Germany, Belgium and France Banned iPhone 12 in their country. And also many iPhones are getting Green line or Green tint display after updates. And you guys would never address those things even in your short videos.🤦🏻‍♂️😮‍💨
7:49 I see what you did there
how to play resident on iphone?
I upgraded from 11 to 15 pro max and mine is coming in 3 weeks
Hi
Sounds like , you could have made look those features as bad as you made them look good
So hand on heart. How much did Apple shell out for this Apple commercial?
the voice isolation thing i have it on  my iphone 12 tf are you talking about that''s an ios feature not an iphone one
11:16 this is already in android and xiaomi devices , when they detected automatically as potrait without taking potrait shot they have use to give background blur edit option.
There is a small piece of advice that I would like to include: kindly avoid any music while giving the review...It's kinda irritating...
11.10  even the Samsung note 8 have the feature and no one appreciate it
one small mistake there... it doesn't go up by $100, there's actually a $200 difference..so it still makes £100 difference.
Voice isolation was always there mf
Thanks to Arun Maini, for such a microscopic review of minute differential upgrades in iPhone 15 Pro. As thumbnail confirmed that Apple & Arun both think  "Better than you think.
Voice isolation was already there in 14
U are sold out to Apple. Dude remember technical guruji. He used to be a huge YouTuber like you. But now he is nothing because he sold himself to top tech companies. You know that this phone is bull shit. It’s the same as 14 pro max and yet u are saying that this phone is amazing. Wow bro
18:28 one small mistake there... it doesn't go up by $100, there's actually a $200 difference
How much they gave you 😂😂
When you talked about back tap on I phone i immediately went to a video to learn how to turn that on. So thanks for that!
That’s great and all - but… why is your camera on the bottom when you switch to landscape mode? Am I the only one who’s bothered just by seeing this? When I turn my phone, the notch is ALWAYS on the left. Great Video!
Great informative review with loads of wonderful brolls as usual. Thanks
Looks like a bad apple advertising campaign. LoL.
So when can I expect your “switching back to iPhone” video?
3🥴3
Every iPhone is “ Better than you think”. I’m good. In 7 years when the iPhone minis are rare and worth $50k I will be selling all of them and buying a family.
Iphone must be the most boring  phone in existence. The only thing thats still interesting about it is how apple and their influencers explain the price hike each time.
Bruh how hard are you trying to bang your charger in your 14 to make them marks 😭😭😂
I agree, wot apple has achieved to do is a marvel, but frankly saying, i think the s24 ultra is gonna blow it out of the water. But then again, even s24u would be very expensive.
salary has been credited
Everything is better than i think according to  arun
The always on display is probably one of the big reasons why the battery is less good.
7:51 BRUH " AYO CHILL" 😂
The thing is Apple is good but when a new Samsung flagship device launched Apple disappeared as usual. All you tubers prefers Samsung functionalities and camera but they also prefer Apple's privacy and OS. As a conclusion they use both. This rival continues... 😅
I just got an iPhone 14 pro max 💀
I can’t believe this. Incredible excitement and a lot of BS about no upgrade at all. Unfortunately, I will have to go somewhere else if I want genuine review of any product.
Hmmmm...I'm already bored with that grey color. And that was the most interesting part😮
where can i download your wallpaper????
I have an iPhone 14 pro max, preordered the new 15 pro max 1TB… this is the first time in my adult life I watched a review and it talked me “out” of a phone lol. Literally just cancelled my preorder. Clearly wasn’t going to be worth it after watching this.
Samsung s23 ultra vs iphone 15 pro😢
The difference between the pro and pro max is not $100, it is $200. 18:30
iPhone 14 Pro had the worst camera experience I’ve ever used.
U have such a nice cat its so cute
Please do an S23 ultra vs 15 pro max comparison video
Hi im wanting to get my first smartphone and i was looking at getting a oppo a74 and j was wondering if you can do a review for it so I know if its anygood as I have been watching you for a while and trust your judgement I'm wanting to get a oppo a74 as the shop near me currys PC world has them selling for £120 so it's cheaper than some ive seen
READ IF YOU WANT TO BUT IT'S QUITE LENGTHY - would love to see your replies to my opinion.   If only Apple was less expensive, that is the problem. As they are such a big brand, they are able to charge these higher "premium" prices, instead, your only paying for the brand name. It's useless. they've got their target audience right. Loads of kids in this world are almost "brainwashed" into wanting an iphone, only wanting an iphone, a phone is a phone. 😂 Literally, school children get bullied for not having an iPhone, i've seen it.  Content creators, love iPhone for it's "premium" aspect, and "better quality" cameras, I cannot name a content creator which I watch/follow on socials who has a Samsung, it is always a 3-rear camera iphone (pro line-up) I bought an iPhone 12, roughly 2 years ago now (2021) as I wanted a change from android/samsung as a whole. I'm either going to go back to Samsung for an upgrade or purchase the 14 Pro Max. It is the same phone, same visuals, same UI, just a new chip. iOS has never really changed apart from when they added widgets for the 1st time and everyone was obsessed. I'm not even going to talk about personalisation, because the appearance and creativity of making it your own is literally all Samsung and Google's Pixels are seemed to be known for. If you love iPhone, and will only ever use iPhone then good for you.   Yes okay, the iPhone 15 is an improvement to the 14 as they've improved the interactive notch a lot more, and that is the only reason I would upgrade to another iPhone is to experience the interactive notch. It just doesn't feel exciting, it still has the 13 design, which got carried over to the 14, again, the software is the same, no new visuals. USB-C... well you know Apple was just trying to keep in touch, with the whole move to USB C, some newer laptops and phones use USB-C to charge. It is about remaining in competition. If USB-C was never a thing, you know full well the iPhone 15 would have had the lightning connector. Samsung need to release their own spin on the interactive notch, like the Samsung Magic Panel or something. - I know there are apps to do this. but I like it to be kept vanilla.
How is it that every time Apple launches a new iPhone, every single reviewer calls it the same old first and then talks about the "many little things" it has and then 6 months down the line it's again the same old boring iPhone.   Hmmm, I see a pattern here!
voice isolation was there before…i used it on my 13 pro max and 13 mini
An honest suggestion Arun, it’s almost end of 2023, you gotta change your background/backdrop to something more exciting. This is just not doing it anymore 😅
Very good review 😊
Love your clarity in speech
You should be salesman for iPhones that’s crazy  everything you’ve said is like Apple Pay you to Marketing for them wow what’s new about iPhone that you’re saying all of good things about it I’ve been using the iPhone for very long time and nothing has changed since the iPhone 11
Never míss the hole 🔋🍑
Sometimes I just want to kick back, relax and watch your videos. Thanks for everything!
I'm not sure about power of the Processor, since Apple will throttle down the speed after 2-3 years
The children won't remember, but Motorola used the same material in a much larger quantity in the V60 :D
niiceeeeee
But Samsung is still better cuz bulletproof screen, little bit water proof, lots of storages, long battery life, charge really fast, good camera look, and so much more things that is better and apple is just doing the same things just doing it bigger and better camera no hate to apple it's just there bad like tiktok but do what you want whit you're money ju9st don't waste you're money on apple cuz 1k for a iphone wenn Samsung has the same phone just cheaper
samsung better
wow 👍👍❤️
Waiting for S23 ULTRA vs iPhone 15 PRO max. All spec comparison
it's pretty normal for a phone to only have 12mp on a zoom camera? 😁 My xiaomi 13 pro says hello with 50mp telemacro/Zoom Camera 😎👌
Voice isolation. Isn’t that a year old? My sisters iPhone 12 has it
No matter how average iphone will some YouTuber will always show them by overhyping😒😒😒
Lots of improvements but nothing to convince myself to change the Iphone 12 to 15!
As it was😂😂😂😂
Now Type C supports OTG ?  If it does, it's gonna be a big thing. !
Wow, easy to see, how much work has gone, to create this video!
So, what did you prefer High shutter speed  Or BETTER HDR
IN SERCH OF HIGH SHUTTER SPEED  IPHONE LOSS THE HDR PERFORMANCE SUMSUNG HDR PERFORMANCE BUT LACKS IN SHUTTER SPEED  AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE PROCESSOR LIMIT THAT THE SENSOR AND SOFTWARE  LIMITATION 😊
What a review, meticulously made!
thanks now make a video about the bad stuff
6:27 id love fifa
hey arun if this video hits 5 million views u gimme the iphone k👍
where can i get that wallpaper?
About that portrait mode- The idea of post editing portrait was already there. because I had been using it on my pixel 6 device. You can adjust what needs to be focused and what can be out of focus and also how much bokeh or depth you need. I had been using it for two years. It is located under tools when you activate editing in google photos. But i think apple's version of it may be slightly better. Just saying apple didn't invent it but rather copied it.
7:50 Lmao 🤣!! I see what you did there Arun!
Plus 200$ the regular Iphone pro pricefpr years, to get this ? 😂😂😂 Isheeps assemble ! 😅
Call isolation was out before the 15 series, not something new
I liked the "jab" at handheld gaming systems battery life 😅 but I did not hear how long you could play Resident Evil on the phone... 👀 So... how long can you play a triple A game on the new phone?? Or are you assuming (probably correctly) that the phone will last more?
Can you make a video about AR glasses and iPhone 15 Pro?
not me watching this on my iphone7+ acting like i know if there’s a difference between iphone 14 and 15🥲
When is the battery test gonna drop?
arun with that chain🤩
The face time hand actions are not working on my iPhone SE (2020) after updating to ios 17
Longest iphone ad ive ever seen
Great video!! Where can I get that wallpaper? Thanks!
11 has voice isolation what are you talking about?
Voice isolation is in every iphone arun 😵‍💫😐
He is sponsored thats why i phone 15 pro is better than you think.
I like iphone 15 pro max 😊
Time stamps please
live mode is also the same as other iphones . is there any change?
my man arun would have the greatest collection of apple stickers
Wallpaper link pls ?
NICE
Did he paint his nail white to match the color of the phone in 13:10 ??
I can't wait to see s24 ultra
Hey Aaron, you did not mention anything detailed about the end A17 Pro. Should I expect it in different video? 😅
Most of the bloggers are reviewing pro and pro max models  Becos there is nothing in basic 15 series phones
Have they enabled noise cancellation for calls to and from Android phones?
Wallpaper?
Also want to point out . . . You have always been able to use the volume buttons for the shutter.
I skipped Technical Guruji's unboxing video to watch yours. Great work man
Long talk cut short ...only camera is good which always was...rest is boring as usual on i phones ....
Samsung looks better  :)
How has something like HEIF impressed you? That option has been available on Samsung for sometime.  Why is it that pre-existing features on other devices when introduced on Apple make reviewers present them as if this is some really cool stuff.   The Apple bias is real folks.
Yoy have 16.4 million subs bow havent you passet Apple?
IPhone have typically only added varied post shoot focusing to my lost galaxy a52s, HEIF had been there,I couldn't use it because those photos are not compatible with the rest of the computers and phones around, turning regular photos to portraits has been in Android for over 3 years now, so, they should mainly show off the titanium frame as anything new to my former galaxy A52s
This was a review of the camera with extra notes
Isnt voice isolation available since ios 16 ? 3:39
Is this video sponsored by apple?
Really enjoyed, interesting as always. I just preordered the 15 pro Max and natural natural titanium and should be receiving it Friday if I'm correct I'm going from an s21 ultra so this should be interesting. I'm giving up half of my zoom but the chance to play with the new iPhone camera hopefully will make it worth it in quality. It's been years since I've had an apple and I look forward to the differences between it and an Android. The five exhume was enough that I'm willing to take a chance and drop from the 10x zoom and hope this will get me by and the other features will also make it worth it so we shall see? Your sense of humour and your in-depth analysis always make the videos fun to watch. You have a friend in Columbus Ohio:-)
Bruh voice isolating is also in the iPhone 14 too
Bro is 'never gonna give up' rick rolling us...💀
voice isolation in in iphone 13 pro also no nothing new
Again the camera focus feature is coming from Google pixel at least you can give credit
Try not to drop at the beginning of every video like piece of...
sorry to say, but looks like more of an apple lover's signature review
It's more like rambling rather than informing us of anything new.
I want a iPhone 15 pro max vs the Samsung galaxy S23 Ultra 5G
A little bit bigger battery, so repair shop could not use previous generational batteries. A clever strategy by apple for next 4 years for repairing related to iPhone 15 series.
Now i can convince myself the iphone 15 pro is totally diff than 14 pro .. But still my mind is can't accept the truth 'the both are the same phone with minor changes..'
here is a strategy, first you ( a youtuber with big reach, it could be anyone)  out a video threatening negative review forcing the affected company to reachout with big payout then as a followup do a complete reversal and do a positive review. Can anyone name this strategy pls
or just buy the iphone 13 pro max
DONT you shine ur flashlight at me sir...... 15:17
Nice 👍
so i better never buy iphone it sucks anyway also you lost me as follower, u cannot go and say stupid things like that
And how long will the battery last with those games?
Loved the review mate. Also, I am doubting my own math skills now as the difference between 999 & 1199 is 200$, not 100$ as mentioned 😆😆 Apart from that, banger of a video mate !
The voice isolating feature is straight from samsung android 13 which is called as noise reduction. It also work like a magic. But if samsung did it after apple you call it copied but now apple did we know you can't say that
its nice to see a well made paid review .love...
so eveytime you take a photo it stores a live one? great way to use more storage without needing it
Saying 7 lens system is Apple's way to make public stupid.
I NEED that wallpaper
I'm watching reviews but can't afford even iphone 11 ahahah
Everyone saying these features aren't new but no one is able to implement these features as seamless and user friendly as apple 😅
3:36 Don’t older phones have voice isolation too?
And no charger ...😢
This video is NOT justifying the price and "Innovation", nor it was designed for just the people who use the camera all day long in landscape mode. You shouldn't defend the little things that YOU find interest to the majority.  This phone is a disappointment nothing else
Lmao it’s same damn thing from the previous phones stop lying 🤥 😆
Voice isolation is just a software that all have LOL, its a software like 5 years old, same as USB-C which is older !
Video just went from 9th to 8th on trending when I reloaded o.O
Preordered 15 promax, can’t wait it to get my hands on after this review!
arun we really need a base 15 review too
When you have nothing new to talk about a phone, all you do is talk about action button, noise cancellation, picture format etc. etc. And still call it "better than you think". No honesty
This phone is awesome!! Glad I can buy an Iphone 8 now. Hyped!!
why not doing Honor Magic V2 ?
Voice isolation was there in 16
Apple was forced to use USB by the European court and not out of their own goodness and generosity.😅 great video! Looking forward to the camera wars!
It's interesting, although I’m disappointed about the 5x optical zoom. 10x would’ve been interesting.
Arun is never going to say anything bad about Iphone anytime 😂😂. Its always the best phone for him
there is nothing new to be honest... great vid as always....
Bet you did that phone flip more than 4 times 😂😂😂
I can take 24 pics of 33 MP from S21 ultra in one second when I shoot 8K video; though I agree that not optimized for night time, but in day time it has produced few of the best action pics of my kid and her friends while running / dancing or playing.
2 mins of silence for the clowns🤡 who actually but iPhone💀
IPHONE IS DOING TO ITS CAMERA WHAT NOKIA LUMIA 1020 HAS DONE 10 YEARS AGO,LOL
Will it get another white screen after an update?
Just Stop it.  All you tech reviewers that got that iPhone earlier.  Just stop it.
MOTION PHOTO,PIONEERED BY NOKIA LUMIA 1020
And my S21 ultra still takes better pics than 14 pro; and I have not talked about pro mode yet.
Thank you for a detailed, VERY DETAILED comparison! Makes it very worthwile to watch these videos before upgrading!
Thanks for letting us U.S. people know we’re getting ripped off a hundred bucks, give or take
wait we are in the 15 now
3:52 voice isolation in mic is not new it was on iPhone 14
You are making assertions that I find questionable. It seems like you are attributing quotes and making comparisons without sufficient context. The presence of action buttons on phones predates the recent models, going back more than a decade. This feature is reminiscent of the Sony Xperia series, and the comparison to the PS4 console, which was launched in 2013, feels somewhat misplaced. Now apple will release iphone 16 please compare it with Apple I. More than 70% of video just explaining camera. Obviously its latest model camera will be slightly better. But making a fuss about it is not good. A phone at this price point surely requires more innovation. Please stop boasting a 5% yearly upgrade as giant leap forward.
I miss the good days when phones didn't exist. People actually were talking to each other as opposed to now on their phones all the time. Sure, phones are great but its getting too much now.
That part about going from 2x-4.9x zoom making the photo lose detail was interesting. Would have thought that it wouldn't. Thanks for including that.
Unhappy about no charger? Here, take this sticker instead
Where can I get that wallpaper?
I can't afford one I am very poor 😢😢😢😢
Give me one please
The base iphone 15 is absolutely trash literally 60hz screen low battery older chip 😂
Do ROG Phone 7 Ultimate vs iPhone 15 pro max
😢😢😢 i wish i could had iPhone like that i really dream that
I’ve been wondering for years why console games aren’t released on iPhone/Android, if the switch can run the Witcher 3 then damnit so can a newer iPhone lol
All that you talk about are just about camera. Yeah ok whatever
Iphone 13 and 14  are facing display problems after updating saw some videos on internet... what do you think about this arun
Aaron will make sure Android lovers will start living Iphone too 😂❤
Voice isolation isn't new
Thanks but it's very disappointing to still see that awful, waxy/smeary looking skin that screams it was taken with an iPhone at 14:56  Not to mention the terrible grey/yellowish skin tones that make you look sickly. I can see the smeary look in some of the other photos too. I have 15 year old Canon point and shoot cameras with smaller sensors and 1/4 the megapixels that produce better looking photos. I'll have to wait until I can fully test it but I am not impressed at all. Was really looking forward to getting a 15 Pro too. Im really hoping the RAW photos look much better.
its just getting the same as the tie passes
How many YouTubers I have seen narrating the same thing about the little things on the new iPhone??! I swear all the YouTubers are scared like sh×t from Apple they even praise a phone its biggest upgrade was USB C 🙄
This is a Ad!
I just knew something was coming after the Mega😂
voice isolation feature works fine in 13 gen phone as well
ideal
They legit had to put in a USB-C and then featured it as if it's something new and innovative. Apple really is a money hungry greedy company.
Hi Drisha!😍
Wow, they wrapped the 14 in the 15 packaging. But wait, we have usb port. Didn't the EU force you to change. Shhhhhhhh
1. Ultrawide and Tele lenses seem dated with the 12mp and small aperture sizes. 2. Should have kept the 3x and should have had a 10x.  3. Main camera should have gotten a bigger sensor. 4. Video should have gotten 4k 120fps. GoPro has had it for a few years now, so should the Iphone.  5. Still no manual controls on Pro models is a damn disgrace.  6. Same charging speed and no thunderbolt feels like Apple is giving us and the EU the 🖕🏼 7. Cinematic video in 60fps would have been appreciated.
"When you go like this, your finger is naturally resting on it." *ahem* (not thinking dirty thoughts whatsoever)
i think backtap is only on the iphone x and up
Bro pretends that he uses his phone with no phone case
My galaxy s23u corners dig into my hands I hate it
so in conclusion...... nothing really changed other than usb-c lol.
Voice isolation = samsung Voice focus 😂
This man is legend to give exact details salute man you gave us the excellent review of this phone others are only showing this or that same again and again you are giving us true review everybody please help to make this man no.1 in tech reviews
amazing review - thank you
Man waiting fir s25
Apple needs to pay him to give such a good summary on a phone that barely brought anything to talk about
Battery testing
I watch a lot of your videos and just had some feedback. Lately, the background music has been very distracting, taking away from the content.
Ar-Rahman (Arabic: الرحمان, ar-raḥmān; meaning: The Merciful) is the 55th Chapter (Surah) of the Qur'an, with 78 verses (āyāt). ... The title of the surah, Ar- ...
i know you apple people hate hearing all the same features, but as someone who hasnt used one in 10 years i have no idea wtf they do and i really appreciate it. I really love the phone gaming !!! and did you call a ROUTER a roooter lol xD <3
can you even diffirentiate 5 photos taken from the 5 latest iphones?
@Mrwhosetheboss can you please do a video comparing the battry life of all of apples pro phones
Most of the new features in apple is copy from Samsung. Samsung invented those features thousand & thousand years ago. For android users it nothing new specially samy fans.
Apple making fools out of  their customers.
Voice isolation was already before the iPhone 15 I have a 13 pro and it was already there when ios17 beta came out
ALL PS4 consoles support HDR. LOL
Apple not seeing my wallet come out until they make another mini. F’em
iPhone have a back tap feature??? Since when 😮
I’m using Voice Isolation from 1 year. What is new here?
What are the phone’s new features?  You get a breaded slow USB type C that doesn’t fold   iNnOvAtIoN
You are really stretching here. All of these "new features" will easily be forgettable after a weeks use. we all know this...
Feedback: The thumbnail looks like an ad post. Paste your face on it and see how the views skyrocket.  Regards!
Waiting for our epic video s23 ultra vs iphone 15 pro max
Kittttyyyyyyyy! 😊
2:00 Lol. Gen Z left the chat.
Even though, no major diff between 14 and 15
Apple sheep will say that every year
I am gonna get my iphone 15 on friday since that is when I believe it will arrive in stores
What's a big new thing : USB C.  Android phones are like hold my beer 🍻😂😂
You did not mention that the new USB-C is running at USB 2.0 speed unless you get the Pro Max.
I like your content but iPhone is crap and they are all the same, you're getting that for an action button😂. Whatever they have improved Samsung is far ahead so be realistic
Yes, the 11 was my favorite to hold!
Voice isolating was there already
Question. Can an Android USB C cable charge the iPhone 15 series?
Where is the wallpaper from?
You forgot to turn off the flashlight at 15:15 🤣😂
I can game on the 14 pro max too no issues this just a waste of $$ and them trying to sell us the same phone all over again
Comparison between pixel's 5x zoom vs 15 pro max would be a cool concept. 😊😊😊
I think this video was unnecessarily this long. the phone does not have anything new for it to be this long. the camera section is an overkill.
iPhone 15 Pro Review - Hotter(thermal throttle) than you think.
Arun, you are becoming greater day by day. That was the most  thorough review of iphone 15 I have found in Youtube till now. 😊
I don't think we will have a portless iPhone because if that was the case, Apple would have to kill their entire Accessory lineup and they make a lot of money on accessories.
that purple wallpaper looks amazing
Could you show the new Huawei mate60 and Harmony OS4 please 😊😊😊
Apple should really made this fast charging. I dont know why they didnt do that. It would have been huge for apple. Other than that I wish the camera was even better than 14 pro. I was waiting for it. I guess I´m gonna get the 15pro just because they hopefully they manage to solve the battery problem and its a more mature pro model than 14. Not because the 15 is really a big difference.
$999 to $1199 is not a hundred dollars more. Just helping with the math.
Everything is a "feat" when its apple for Arun. I bet if these same so called features were added to an android smartphone we would've got 60% video complaining. It's amazing how Arun made almost 20 min video with just 8 min worth of content. (Exaggerating every piece) of course
Please bring up a review for iphone 15 and 15plus
Please bring up a review for iphone 15 and 15plus
All good but 80% people wont be able to see any differences xD
I think the thumbnails used are interesting. For apple devices it is always “next level” or “better than you think” vs for better devices it is “is it really worth it” or “do you need an upgrade”. May be one has to go through the entire video to get details, but the initial thumbnail which can leave some impression is carefully written to support Apple.   In addition some ordinary or last implemented or poorly implemented apple features are given lot more emphasis and not better features on other devices. This is just an observation.
"Fastest way to open the camera." Double tap power button: am I a joke to you?
16:06 key ponit😮
Want that wallpaper please
I really love the content, but quick question tho, how do you play re on the phone, is it using a simulator?
You can take photos with volume buttons as well.i think volume button is more comfortable to use as a shutter than the action button.
I think iphone will win the handheld gaming era 🤔 i think I'll switch to iphone for now
I’ve been watching these reviews across different channels for like over a decade and had never seen yours. I’ve gotta say, this was the most thorough, informative, cinematically beautiful and honest video I’ve ever seen about the iPhone. Subscribed 🤘🏼
How do you play console games on the iPhone. I also didn’t know yiu could have back taps and power button taps and I’ve had an iPhone since the color 🤯
I'm still goi g back to Samsung. O jad the 12 and 14 pro.max after fewonth of using it i reali get really bore with my phone and just leave it any were, with Samsung there always something nee to discover
I thought they’ve had voice isolation for a long time. Am I from the future or something?
Do you guys think it’s worth for me to upgrade from my 11 pro to 15 pro rn or just ride it out till next year ?
when a paid shill is paid
I honestly think iphone users have been buying the same phone for 4 years
You know... I love your videos. I really do. One thing, though... a very wtf thing is... you could powder your face. LOL I know, it sounds strange. But since you use a lot of light, you could powder your face a bit, so it wouldn't become "shiny", if you know what I mean. LOL Sorry, I do like make up, so... :P
Does anyone realise there are so many new tech reviewers pops ups just to review huawei 60 pro, with subscriber from few hundred to a few thousand, I think this is their advertising campaign
Who needs this?
So, what's new?  Basically, Camera improvements and nothing else! 🤣
It would've been nice if Apple released the Pros in black packaging instead of just white.
very nice and detailed on the camera review! well done Arun :)
5:15  uses milo as phone stand 😂
We must not forget that the iPhone 15 pro costs more than the PS5 and Xbox 1 combined, while you will quickly discharge your iPhone every day if you often play console games, it’s easier and more convenient for me to come home and play on a big screen TV than on a small one smartphone, and then also charge it because games quickly drain the battery)))
Bad iphone 15
Your going to give me a stroke with the animation
Will stick with my iPhone 13 pro max, for a long time…. The phones have maxed out in my opinion. If you want to take an amazing picture buy an DSLR camera, because when you transfer the photos to a computer the lower resolution stands out badly.
Sad to see you fanboing on the new Iphone picking out the teenie tiniest points and praising them to the sky. What happened to the facts opposed to personal preference and feeling? Lets just put in some more useless stuff, like the small Edges and praise it like they havent been there on most phones since 2019?? Really sad to see this, thought you could be more objective...
18:08 the new usb-c airpod pros 2 (which should be called airpods pro 3) can supposedly do lossless with the vision pro. They might go to portless if they can figure out data transfer with magsafe and lossless wirelessly
What every reviewer forgets when they talk about improvements from last years model is that most consumers don’t update yearly. I’m updating from a 12pro, and the differences are huge
Does apple pay you for telling it's next level?
Why has no one mentioned that action button is basically the bixby button that samsung has had since s10?!
Sponsored by Apple text missing 😅😅
S23 ultra user here, that video at 14:47 is insane, apple has all my respect when it comes to video quality
voice isolation was on pixel 7 years ago
Bought 14 pro max last year but returned within a week and not going back this path unless they come up with a revolutionary design and features.
Those camera pictures features already existed more then 10 years ago on HTC one m7
I’m really waiting to see the battery tests / comparisons
it's illegal to put your phone on the cat butt while playing resident evil
Bro found out more features than mkbhd💀💀💀💀💀
Drinking Kool aid
I’m getting the 15 pro, but should I get the max or regular?  Big screen and battery vs. 1-hand use and less pocket real estate ? 🤔
Can you find out if this phone has heat issue where the brightness dims due to heat.
തേങ്ങയാണ്... കായി കിട്ടുന്നതിന് തള്ളിമറിക്കേണ്ട...
Can't imagine what s24 will pack up its sleeve
Thank you ... please keep the rainbows OUT OF YOUR VIDEOS
Still not better than I thought, I am waiting for 17😂
so iPhone 15 is just a minor upgrade to the iPhone 14
Can we make phone calls with iPhone 15 , 😬
Can we get the wallpaper in the thumbnail
Voice isolation is something I have been using since I got my I phone 13. Is it again updated ? Overall great video
I would like to say , could I have 1k or 500 bc I’m trying to buy a ps5 and some AirPods Pro 2 USB-c pls
HE TRIED CONVENCING US BUT STILL IPHONE 15 PRO IS WASTE OF MONEY TBH CHANGE MY MIND
Purane carry ko dekh kr maza aa gaya😌
Welcome to Galaxy S21 😏
Put the hard to reach button on the bottom, easy to reach when holding it and easy to reach when in landscape mode🤷🏽‍♂️
I love how everyone in the tech community does seem to always "exaggerating" everything related to Apple products.. especially "the iPhone"..  Where essentially they just release "the same phone" but "not quite the same" and by that they justify the prices to be higher.. 24 MP ????? Really ????? We're on the social digital world.. nobody's gonna zoom in ur photo and check if there's any small tiny bugs was captured..
I am sure this fella is paid to shill iPhone 15 products. It is understandable, not surprised.
If there was a way to use action button as camera button, like half press to focus, like in Sony pro phones would be cool
feels like an Ad for Apple.. bloody sellout
Mate, I feel that you got paid out by Apple,  like come on man, a whole new expensive iphone that iPhone 14 can do if you update the software...
ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew
15pro is better than 15promax  cause screen problem in 13/14 promax green screen, white screen, glitch etc.  15promax is also worrying.😂
Don't lose the Samsung fam lad
Wallpaper ?please
Hi, please tell me the wallpaper being used
Damn bro I never knew anything about cameras before this video . I don’t even deserve single lens 😂
This video shows that its paid promotion by applem.
Im still stuck with a s21 i want on 😢
2:23 Stop the cap!!....  Double tap OFF button... android... I'm already taking a pic while you're holding your button for cam to come on.
Eiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii within 2 his 2M views 😥😥🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Pet slavery spotted 🤣😾
I love the shape and feel of the iPhone 11.
People say the iPhones look the same, but just look at the “new” samsung phones
I like how he used his cat as a phone stand lol
did i just see a Mrwhosetheboss earbuds?  17:19 👀
LOL... heeeeere we go. Let's convince the lamens that they'll notice a difference
The volume up button also acts like a camera shutter button, the voice isolation mood was in iOS 16, and finally, can we get a link to your wallpaper?
Isn't voice isolation on every iphone?
Imagine if we can use the iphone as a literal entry level gaming console; hook it upto a monitor/tv and play these console games with a controller.
@Mrwhosetheboss nice review over there wish i could get an apple device from you
Are the iphone 15 pros having any issues by far? Should i order now or wait for a couple of months before buying it?
Yaaayyyyy the same shit again that will be praised as "revolutionary" and yet......android BEEN doing it 😂😂😂😂
Great review, best on youtube
Need that wallpaper 😊
you talk specs you dont talk review
Sony needs to comeback to smartphone space. Most apple features seems to cater to USA. Its samsung/apple duopoly plus bunch of chinese phones.
The voice isolation is an old feature
What I 🤔 it's . Totally Money dump.. 5 mint you only took about button and one filter .. it's totally dump bro..
All of these upgrades that this iPhone 15 pro do is just solving the first world problems it created to itself
ALERT--   PAID VIDEO
more like sales advertising then reviews
10:24 Arun tickles his fiancee's neck like she is Milo
16:15 That laugh was personal..😅
Were they released already? If so I gotta get my 14 pro at a discount now 😊
Where can we get that wallpaper?
These phones are fucking up our kids minds
The smooth review still now😂❤
A Dream of every Pakistani Poor Boy but cannot get 😢😢😢
Is the battery better than the iphone 13 pro max?
Apple is rotten
Man😂😂😂I was happy to see Mr Bean 😂😂Nice work Arun
Iphone 15 ...introducing revolutionary USB-C  xD
It would have been really great if Apple would have released Dynamic Island to 14 non pro models. 15 is basically Pro without the additional features of Pro models.
Since you played a game in the new Iphone 15 pro max did you feel any heat in the back of the phone ?  I'm pretty sure a lot of people would like to have an answer for this question , since the overheating was a problem in the past versions ,I hope this problem was solved .
0:40 any "I phone"
fed
i have voice isolation in my 11
Man.. because of this, I'm sold in upgrading to 15PM instead of S23U. Thanks, Arun! 👍
Can you plug USB C flash disk to iphone 15 series and actually can move files from files app like we can on Ipad with usb C? If so, that's great upgrade.
Looks like most guys are comparing $1000 phones with half price of another Android phones.
0:10 USBC?????
18:27 100 dollar or 200 dollar????
Voice isolation mode is also available on my iPhone 13. Not sure it earlier models are supported.
how was he playing resident evil vllage on mobile? XD
I don’t wanna sound like a drag, but there’s no way I’m playing Village on a phone. That game had some fantastic environments that deserve to be experienced on a full sized monitor or TV in at least 1080p.
Motion photos as standard? Again, how is Apple just doing this?
Prices are also next level never heard of
What’s the major difference iPhone 14 and 15
Can October 9 come already? My 15 pro max is set to come😢
iPhone power isn't pure raw power is the big wall I think android ports will have to overcome if AAA games are to come to Android. iPhone always somehow has more for less all thanks to Apple's dedication to optimizing and hardware specific code. And this RE8 running on iPhone is heavily supported by Apple's optimization and code alongside a power bump/dedicated RTX cores on the A17 Pro
Apple spent all their money on influencer marketing instead of an actual new iPhone this year. What's baffling is that Apple is normalizing selling you the same thing every year, because people will still buy it.
We are waiting for charging test and drainagebtest.
he is apple fanboy
You show the action button activating the camera shutter. I had to try it on my Samsung, and the volume up button activates the shutter button. How is Apple just adding this feature?
The best implementation of telephoto zoom hardware wise  is the new xperia phone. It would have been great to have continuous optical zoom from 3x to 5x.
Wallpapers please
Practically every new iphone is same as previous for a normal user. Overpriced!
"How many will come after this honeymoon period?" Thats what she said
So you present features that all iPhones have?
I'm convinced this video holds the key to a brighter world!
can you make a vid on the red magic 8s plz
He's just an apple meat rider at this point
The iPhone 15 with the new features like USB-C in the action button is really the first phone that I REALLY WANT TO save up money to buy next year after the 16 is released and the 15 goes down in price
Another AWESOME and informative review, thank you for adding just a bit of a smile, and a bit of knowledge to my day!
An expensive copy of samsung
7:50 🤣🙌🏾
Consoles are genuinely going to become obsolete as phones continue to get more powerful. Just plug into a tv or display and connect a controller and you’ll have the same experience as a console.
Android pirates been gaming for years
Wait, I-Phone 15 came out
I like it more on the google pixel how you can double tap on the power button to open camera, and then use the volume down button as the shutter button. Really great for taking photos
You did the job for what you got.. 😂
Too bad I can never afford one.
11:13 you think you could sneek that photo in without anyone noticing?!
I wonder how much Apple pays you to bullshit lol. I respect your reviews, but you should only buy this phone if you're coming from an older model. Half-upgrades arent worth it
Your nails are so white I thought you were wearing nail polish😅.
Video s23 ultra Vs iPhone 15 Pro max cemara video 😂
Vro will you buy the titanium one
a lot of this is just ios 17... voice isolation is on every iphone now
can we get Samsung s23 ultra vs iPhone 15 pro max ULTIMATE BATTLE?? Please!
im currently typing on a iphone 13 pro with 64% battery and my phone dies so fast which makes me so mad
dude tried so hard to sell features that matter so little
Useless review that doesn't show any negatives.
B roll with drisha holding the phone is refreshing
Hi, I wanted to know if the video camera quality is any better?
where is the battery test
I live in New Zealand and I can't wait to get rid of my old iPhone 13 Pro and upgrade my phone to the new $2099 iPhone 15 pro 😙
I need voice isolation mode for my airpods pro when I send voice notes
poor arun is trying very hard to sell apple phone....lol
i never understood why people pay nore and more each year for the same phone that came out last year, oh ya they added an extra features.
One thing that needs to be mentioned more are the storage markups. On all iPhones, going from 128GB to 256GB is $100, and 256GB to 512GB is $200. On a SSD, the price of those upgrades would be about $5 and $10, respectively. This is a 20x markup!!
With British accent, iPhone 15 Pro seems a lot better... 😆😆😆
Wallpaper link pls?
Shooting in Prores video was locked to models with 256gb and above with 14pros.  If that's still the same, I think Apple is misleading again. And Pro Max in default 256gb? I can smell something..
Yeah thanks for the 20 mins of nothing that helps..
Iphone 15 pro max vs Xiaomi 13 ultra camera test.
Could you compare photography and video on 13 vs 14 vs 15?
Apple running out of ink fr 🤣
At first glance I thought “damn 20 min video”  And here I am after watching the entire thing 😂  Fantastic video. All the camera details were epic. Thank you for taking the time to write all of this and executive beautifully
Today I learned about the back tap feature 🤯
How did he get it early?
Man influencers are selling iphone15 hard. Like miniscule upgrades getting blown out. Everything here isnt new.
is this the phone with the latest usb 2.0 innovation?
Yeah it's approaching the levels of speed of the MacBook but the MacBook is really slow for a flagship laptop so
Isn't all these features available in Android...😂
GO BILLS
Omg I really wish ppl would quit saying that the Pro Max is $100 more expensive. It’s the same price as last years 256gb model. You just can’t buy a 128gb model this year.
Happy to see that Apple is FINALLY going back (a little) to the curvier phones of the 6-11 era. I have an 11, my dad the X, and my gf has the 13. My 11 and my dad’s X feel so much better and smoother to handle than her 13, it’s wild. It’s one of the reasons I’ve been holding off on upgrading, but now I think I finally will.
It won’t change the fact it didn’t achieve our expectations.
When in person, do you talk sideways?
Wallpaper?
I feel all the tech reviews about new iphone are biased, Apple could have easily lowered the price since they are using the same tech for quite a long period. Yet they come up with a boring design without any major improvement at least in the pro version. Concerning is all the reviewers still appreciating it😅.
I couldn’t wait until you had one in your hand to give us a review🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
can you make another video just like this, just without talking about the camera's whatsoever
Next level video as always
Your fiancé is so beautiful. Congratulations my friend. She is a very lucky girl because we all adore you and know your a great guy 😊and you guys are both blessed to have each other.🙏🫶
"But this is standard" IS SO LAME. Stop holding these companies to such low standards when WE ARE PAYING PREMIUM PRICES. When will we start calling these companies out for once??
voice isolation was already present in iOS 16
Great video! Link to wallpaper?
iPhone 14 user should just wait for the 16.  Will have all this improvements and more
Can’t wait to have it hopefully I get it monday
Milo doubles as a mobile stand 😂
The fake lens focal lengths don't have the same perspective as a true lens, and the whole purpose of using different focal lengths, and why photographers buy different expensive lens that don't seem that different when it comes to zoom length, is for that change in perspective. If they want to get in closer, they zoom with their feet. That being said, it's an easy feature to ignore and the other camera upgrades are still good.
2:43 I didn't even know there was a feature like this. Damn I have a new toy to play with...
Camera comparison vs lastest Samsung plzzzzz
Always an excellent review! I can watch your videos from start to finish and not feel like I’m getting bored! Can’t wait for my 15 pro max
i watched the official apple's introduction video, and for the whole 5 mins i was waiting for something new. the titanium thing is nothing new  and the new feature button is absolutely nothing useful
I've been using Samsung since 2015 and promised I'd go back to iPhone when they upgraded to USB-C.
No negative points to tell? 😢
I'm still on the iPhone 6S plus would anybody give me a new one hahahaha it's been way too long since I have a proper phone
You have voice isolation on other Iphones too, I have 11 and use it alot
Are all of these YouTubers getting paid by Apple one way or the other lol? Hard to find reliable sources of information to trust nowadays 😅😅
Tbh it’s not worth upgrading from a 14 to any 15. From a 12? Yes. A 13? Maybe. Not a 14
I'm sorry, brotha. This phone ain't it. If you criticizes the fold 5 for minor updates, you can't hype this up.  Simple
If apple was a gaming  But what about iPhone 6 RAM
Sounds like the 15 is just again optimized. Other than the looks, those hardware changes don't need a new phone every year.🤦‍♂️ From the iPhone 12(A14), 12 Pro(A15) To iPhone 13 (A16), 13 Pro(A16). While the iPhone 13 Would be our now 15. See? So in other words Apple fans who buy a new iPhone every year gotta are delusional and mentally lost.
Which is the color of 15 pro here? Titanium white or Natural Titanium?
Does the sound isolation works with beats fit pro while you’re on a phone call ?
Thanks Arun for your detailed review of the new Eye phone. 🙂
4:56 Milo the Multipurpose Cat😂😂😂
This advert is codswalop. This man is a con man. He’s waffle waffle waffle. I’ve watched a lot of his videos. Dear oh dear.
Good review. 💯
BETTER THAN YOU THINK  when you see that , you know they failed 😂😂😂
9:26 motion photo is enabled on the s23 ultra making it slower to capture..
That's it..this was the only thing left to see on this channel. Arun cleaning up after Apple.
So that USB C cable isn't that one cable to rule them all? When will techbloggers hold this fucking mess of a situation with how you can't tell the spec of the USB C cables with the same contempt they have of ligthing cables instead of just brushing it aside like it's nothing???
great video as always top notch quality.  but the biggest problem with your video is that you speak about the iPhone like its living in its isolated world and u keep inflating its features like its something new..  i understand some people may not be aware of most of these features and you are trying to make it easier for them.. but it wont hurt if you make it more clear that its nothing new for the smartphone market.. some people may have older phones with the same features u mentioned and now want to upgrade for no reason.. thus wasting their money and even "F'ing the environment up" more.
اشتغل تطبيل ابو فسية، الحين بيجلس يطبل سنة قدام
Mega..Pixel😂😂
We need a vid on iOS 17 it’s confusing
Kudos on the ink joke
Feels a bit like gaslighting
I love your video and your reviews.  But the background music is killing me and made me laugh lol😂😂😂 could you possibly make it a bit less boom boom boom? Hahaha
make me gift 😂 buy for me one iphone 15 pro max
I love voice notes. That’s how I communicate with everyone.
Mate your videos is so intresting i'm gobsmacked.
not getting the fast charge cable is NOT standard for most phones, at least with the androids I bought, they always came with the cable, now the brick on the other hand, that was one+ only
The voice isolation also works with other apps like snapchat calls, facebook messenger calls. It was pretty cool and it was my son who told me about it…. And it was awesome!
I always put a case on my phone as soon as I take its out of the box.  Period.  You are demoing the phone without a case.  The issues you raise are moot.
The volume button already acts as the shutter button
The puns aren't your strong suit....... However, the rest of the content makes up for it.......
wallpaper link?
the action button for camera is bad as it might make your hand shake while taking a photo i like the Samsung approach of the floating shutter on screen or using the pen.
How much they pay you?
I’ve watched several videos today on the new iPhone and this has been by far the best. So much information that isn’t presented elsewhere. Thank you and keep it up!
The black boxes were only on the 13 pro and max, 14 pro and Max came in a white box like the 15 pros do.
Correct me if Im wrong but the price goes up by 200 not 100.
What’s new about voice isolation 😅
Paid vid 😢
Can u get me one for my college?? 😂🇮🇳
school fights gon go crazzzzyyyy
What, 14th isn't good anymore?
Scary Video Idea: Build 3 computers off if Wish and compare them to the cheap gaming computer setup you bought a while back.
Can u get me one for my college?? 😂
If you want your night sky photos to look better, try lowering the exposure to about -1.3. It sounds preposterous, but trust me, it produces some pretty stunning photos.
16:46 the reason why Apple's A16 chip have battery issues is that they switched from LPDDR4 to LPDDR5 Ram making it a bit power hungry than the A15, basically it's just the same A15 chip overclocked with an upgraded power hungry ram. The A17 Pro's 3 nanometer node can achieve efficiency with LPDDR5 ram
This and iPhonedo are almost the only channels that offer thoughtful and detailed reviews. The others are mainstream NPCs.
Trying so hard to sell the iPhone! Apple thrives on folks like us. Not even a point of giving a USB c cable without a brick that was never shipped by Apple before.
Arun i think you should discuss with mkbhd first which one of you should praise or condemn apple product after the phone get to the buyer hand 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
For 90% of users none of this matters tho. They're just the average consumer who has no idea half these features even exist. They buy iphones for the brand more than anything else
I'm convinced this video is the key to unlocking a lifetime of smiles!
1:23 Wallpaper is sick! What is it?
i didn't got fooled
The camera refocus feature has been on the Samsung for a while now tbh, very useful and fun feature
This one is such an Apple fan boy review, justifying the upgrade. I think I’ll skip upgrading just for the USB C.
Dat punchhole.. 😅😂 Watching videos on this thing must be 'great'.
Tech reviewers common click bait titles - better than you think, not what you think etc
As someone that could only afford the base model I don't wanna watch this video because I'll be sad over missing things lol, but because I like you a lot as a creator I'll drop a like regardless. Will you make a review of the base model too?
how does he have it early
Can u please give me your old iPhone 😢please 🥹🙏🙏🙏am from Africa Ghana 🇬🇭🥹🙏
Welcme to android
I'm still thinking if I should upgrade from my iPhone XS Max
Until apple gets rid of the dynamic island, I'll be sticking with android.
how's the grip ? I usually use my phones without a case, but the 13 Pro Max is just too slippery for my hands to use without one. Can this new design improve that ?
samsung is still far behind than any chinese company (iqoo , poco , nubia ) when it comes to gaming. they only focus on making a camera in the phone which can take a photo of a moon. even company like oppo destroyed samsung in folding phone. i really don't know where samsung's RandD money is going.
Action key is basically just a bixby key. I have an s10+ which has a bixby key and i just use it single press function to open discord.
yeah that's cool and all but why is that tap so damn loud?
Best Iphone 15 series review ever...Kudos Mr Whose the Boss. In fact, you are really the BOSS
Isolation mode was an old feature tho, i got in my iphone 13 promax, so what's new thing tho?
Oh great! Now going to the hospital to sell my kidneys so that I can buy this beautiful piece of tech
🖐🏻 As a life long android user It's becoming harder and harder to justify android   The only things  that won't let me switch to ios right now  1- Emulation gaming on android ( GameCube, psp, ps2, nin switch, wii etc..)  2 - being able to download any paid app for free    3 cracked YT Premiumand cruchyroll for free    4  the huge amount of customization     5 android working better with windows    6 having no money to get rid of my andoird gadgets ( buds, smartwatch) and get new apple ones 🥲
love mr.bean
Ps4 is 1080p don’t put xbox one issues on the PlayStation buddy
Nice wallpaper! where can I get it?
Is this sponsored by Apple?
I just don't like this direction of phones having to be a powerful camera. Personally, I take almost no photos and the fact that most phone companies are focusing so much on that feature is why I'm still using my iPhone 11. I'm probably gonna get the iPhone 16 series since the 11 is still useable, but I really wanted to upgrade now. Sucks that nothing much happened with the 15, otherwise I woulda definitely upgraded.
They just make the same phone with better software 🤦‍♂️,I’m not a Samsung guy but at least they do flips,folds,limited edition,etc.
I wish I could afford a new phone
Bro ok we understand that you are getting soooo much money for these videos and you have to lie a little bit.. but wtf? Chill.. you trying to make it look like it's worth to pay 1800+ euros for the pro max.. cringe
I wish i could own an Iphone one day🙂🙂
Oh my God imagine playing games on your smartphone.....oh wait we've been doing that for years on Android 😂
Do the new iPhones smell like spices?
There is no SIM card slot on the North American version of the 15 only a eSIM 0 slot for old sim
timestamp your videos
Voice isolation is old nothing new about it
I wish the flashlight was called torch here in the us
So basically your saying most of these “upgrades” could be software updates
Has anyone had experience swapping colors day of release? I ordered a black pro max but after seeing all these reviews I really want the natural titanium. Hoping AT&T will have an extra one for me 😢
is this a joke? lol
Looking forward to the battery test the most ! Love those videos very comprehensive.
On my S21 the volume button is a perfect shutter button, I don't need and action button for that 😂
🐒💩
To be honest 15 is just a waste of money
The pro is the one 🌟🔥
It is curious to observe how the reviewers, trying to maneuver between how not to offend iphone users and at the same time trying to give objective information, sometimes manage to say completely incomprehensible things. With all this, they also know how to make a smart look
2 million views in 11 hours is crazy love your vids man
I would buy the 15 pro max had it not been for me upgrading last year to that 14 Pro Max, entirely because I paid that much for the extra storage model which is now the base model
Perhaps it could help with speech to text, isolating the voice and getting a more accurate text.
how can you say it is a good smartphone, when 16 ... SIXTEEN years after the first launch they still did not fix the flare issues ... really ?
I m using 12 pro max and i also have voice isolation
8:21 Bro he’s always trying to rickroll us 😂
So hyped to get the phone that was released like 3 times already hooray 😂
Considering Iphone for the first time. Should I buy 15 or 15 pro ? The current phone I have is an 8 year old Samsung
I thought i had the voice isolation feature in my iphone 11🤔
Can you give me a iPhone 15 pro
One clap for you. Tried really hard.
Didn't you know xbox game pass exists? Games been running smoothly on phones for a while now...
is this vid old? how is drisha his fiance, i thought they got married
For this dude.. no matter how small the differences between a year old or 2 year old iPhone, he would tell you it’s the best thing ever lol.. such an apple fanboy..
Apple: The ivibrato wiill cost $499 This guy: You know i've used many vibrators before but this one just feels different.
I think you are forgetting that timer thing
My favorite parts of everyone of your videos are your puns. Just gold 😂😂
Ayo Chill! lol :' )
The Amount of details and Features you Highlighted on The new Iphones are better than the one I've watched on other channels so far, although i don't use Iphone Anymore, because I'm kinda free guy who Love to do anything on My phone without any barrier, I Love the New Iphone 15 pro Max, Mainly because of the Gaming Features that it featured, it's crazy if you can Play a console game on a Mobile Phone in 2023, we don't know what we will get in the Next years to come, always nice review and Good Work Arun.
You're the reason why I bought my galaxy s22 ultra! I only use your reviews when I'm thinking of buying a new phone 🎉
18:32 The price difference is $200 o, NOT $100 😅
Using the 11. not sure if i should upgrade or wait till 16
what if you plug your ip15 in a power bank using the Type C to Type C cord , will there be a possibility that it may charge the power bank instead of your getting more battery?
I want that wallpaper 😍
8% apr in Canada is just disheartening 😥
playing AAA games on it looks promising. one day i'd like to just plug my phone into whatever flatscreen is in my hotel room and pair my PS5 controller to it, and then start gaming as if i'm on a console.
You mean clear calling and not voice isolation
Is this 11:30 feature going to come to older iPhones?
New bottle old wine.
Nothing New...or inovating
Sorry Arun but the voice isolation feature on calls was available from iPhone 13 series.I have this feature to my iPhone 13 Pro Max. So it's not a new feature on iPhones
Battery capacity and fast charging details ???????
The photos have evolved and are very good, but they are still inferior to the oppo find x6 pro
In one word: overpriced.
Voice isolation been a feature bruh!!! Scam!
I think a Playstation X Apple collab would be happening soon. Playstation has introduced there reputation as a clean aesthetic company from the PS5 so that would be cool.
Back to apple?
Give him a w
I liked my own comment
Gee thanks for brainwashing me to buy the next new iPhone.
We also can edit normal photos to potrait in google photo while ago..
I feel the heat 🥵
looks sick but probably gonna wait for the 16 pro to upgrade from my 13 pro
So many of what apple suggested are niche. Voice isolation is great for the other caller but still terrible for the person trying to listen in (most people will likely have AirPods or some form of noise cancelling headphones) and not solving a problem anyone was really having. Playing Triple A games are cool but on a 7 inch screen..battery life will tank too and ROG Ally will do the same but your phone will still be around in the case you actually need it. The one thing I think everyone can universally use is the USB C. At least on the more expensive variants, I can readily use a PC to transfer and not opt for AirDrop. Also the better Qi2 standard
Use all the IPhones you have to make a comparison of how the camera improved over time(cause that's the only thing they improved) then you can combine the pictures into a video.
When’s the battery test 😊
the background blur looks and feel fake
Do you play bloons td battles?
How does your 15 pro's have sim slots?
Nah same phone
Some cool new features, but I’m not sold on the upgrade. I will stick with my 14 Pro max until next year. Thank you for the review.
10:28 Samsung Motion photo?🤫
Are u giving then away?
Wallpaper?
50% on the camera. Action button? Here’s how to use it for the camera. Yeah, it does other things, but who cares? Am I odd in using the phone for…phone, apps, browsing, etc? Not primarily as a camera.
OH HE GOT MARRIED
Dude !  You are absolutely doing a better job that Tim Cook, in selling an incremental product 🎉 that iPhone 15 is
its a scam lol they make the battery and the phone weaker  so they make money and make the phone $1500 just get a $100 phone my god even my $20 phone is stronger then this scam
I have a 14 pro and voice isolation was already there! What’s new? And wow yes usb-c the INNOVATION. Ah the colors and the titanium case thats been used in space but cover the whole phone with a silicone case anyways…
Idk why i keep watching your coverage of new iPhone each year since i won't be getting any until Apple actually come to my country Indonesia. I refused to pay 1.5 to 2.0 times the actual msrp through resellers. Which is a shame because the iPhone prices are competitive now compared to other flagships and iOS is starting to make Android users like me curious.
I dont got money for a new phone so im rockin the samsung s10e still for 4 years😂
Pls what platform is it built on 'SoC'
The action button definitely should have been near the bottom / mid right
I just got the 14 pro max….  Ok now after seeing this I’m getting the 15 pro max.
It's sad how hard you need to squeeze to find anything interesting to push a product to people, that isn't any different from last year's iphone 14 pro. Guys get the Iphone 14 pro / pro max, thay're cheaper now that this 15 crap is out and they're completely the same and with better colors.
Apple is very good at coming up with 10 new features… and giving you only 1-2 of them each year
Jesus Christ man, what has humanity come to?! Adults getting hard-ons for these devices. Sad times.
I'm not convinced that it's better than I think.
I didn’t plan on upgrading but I’m now 😂
Ayy my first AC was that one too on the PSP 🥲
how come in australia it says that iphone 15 pro max is 2199 dollars?
I'm just waiting on the camera comparison
Just to quote "I have already switched to the iPhone 15pro max" .... Please can I get your 14 pro max 😀
The 14 Pro Max box wasn’t black either so why so many saying the box is now white?
God loves u have a great day
I hope the new cable is less tasty for my cats 😂 I don't know why but they only biting apple cables, Android ones are save ...
your sadly wrong the europea said that apple must have usb-c or they cannot launch a new phone
Who else thinks that Apple should make commercials for the latest iPhone Pros with the Titanium song by David Guetta? LMC if you agree
Android is better
I like you as a YouTuber but it's the same exact thing with very minor differences. Don't try to sell it as something completely different. We're not stupid.
Im trading in my s23 for the pro max
can you make a video of the top 20 tech
Slightly misleading Arun. USB-C was never on the horizon. It was purely because of the EU regulations.
Just awaiting for your review!
I get voice isolation mode on my iPhone 13 PM on iOS 16.6.1
Bruh I'm never buying the iphone 15 cause it's basically the same thing with the 14pro you can't tell the difference between them alot Soo I'm staying with 14pro
imagine a Canon mirrorless camera with iphone tech inside.
Look at the a20
Bro, left his flashlight on for almost the entire video. 💀
Someone make a compilatioon of the amount of times he's jumped into that chair.
Half the presentation is on the camera. Still prefer s23 when it comes to productivity
Ok great 🧐 but how much did Apple Pay you for this ?
why is MJ doing the unboxing :
This is the first time you could not really tell us anything about the iPhone 15 pro max, you talk more of the game that is not what we need,
Anyone else doesn’t use a case like he does 🫡
“You can use the action button to record a video”  Volume button “am I a joke to you?”
If the voice Isolation works for voice typing, it might be my dad's next surgeon phone.
Could you plleeeeeeeaaaaaasssseee talk about the Huawei P60 pro?😢😮
I have iPhone 12 Pro Max and I’ve been playing ps4 and ps5 games on the phone for years
The hype for this phone really fell flat because it looks the same, but the internal changes are incredible.
Is this display gonna go out with horizanal lines like the 13 & 14 pro max
No one cares abt fingerprints on the side of the phone, how tf is every single YouTuber talking abt it
Wow iphone 15 pro Bezels are now Thin..!!! Wait.... my 3 year old Android phone Bezels are still thinner and the front Camera is way Less INTRUSIVE compared to the Massive Dynamic Island of iphone. 😂😂😂😂
성능 테스트나 좀 빨리 해서 올려라
You must have some small hands if it’s hard to hit the action button.
someone please fire tim cook. he's done enough damage ... send him back to the streets...
Imagine GTA V got ported to the iPhone
Apple paid him six figures :D
What is wallpaper
It’s just a phone. An overpriced phone. Yawn.
All these camera features are from huawei p20 pro.
This is the best iPhone 15 Pro review I have seen so far. Good work!
Best review🔥🔥
i hate HEIF format, makes life harder as a backend dev..
How does bro have iPhone 15 alr. 😱
C'mon make a camera versus with your best android Smartphone of 2023 and that is The Galaxy S23 Ultra
Thanks Arun for making a review that doesn’t devolve to Apple bad.
Here in US we’re stuck with eSIM 🤦🏻‍♂️  Must visit UK for a proper iPhone lol
After switching from USB C android phones to iPhone last year I was annoyed all the equipment I had for video / camera stuff was USBC. Going for the 15 Pro now means I won't have to pay for new adapters etc. Pretty happy about that.
great vid! was gonna say the background music in editing is a bit loud/distracting ngl lol
Just 20 minutes of Apple advertisement
everyone in the comment section is an npc there is no practically difference
When is the battery test?
20 minutes video for not 1 single innovation. 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ I hope Apple paid you for this.
Getting an ad for the iPhone 15 before this video started is crazy
Hi
Now the question is, is it worth me trading in my 12 pro max for this one? 🤔
11:13 top left of the phone💀
How could we turn on “lie detector” for this video ?  YouTube you should work too now, you could do it better than apple!
in my opinion you don't need to use anything other than those zoom lenses, because if you want to have a 4.9x magnification its the same to take a 2x zoom picture and then crop it to the part that you want to focus on, which will be much easier and gives you more control when you're zooming in, because you might want to zoom back out again
I still use an iPhone 7 plus
I don’t know why no one is talking about it having a physical sim. While it isn’t exactly new, it’s nice to see it brought back.
kaya nya dejavu aku, fiturnya kya sdh ada di android
9:29 bro, you have unactivated the live photo on the iPhone and activate the motion image on the Galaxy, and you compared the shutter button, box 😮
This is the only helpful review I’ve seen online.
only in first world countries can we complain about the placement of a button meant to be a shortcut for something high tech that was already quite convinient😅
Can I know why we get a phone review in which half of it is just talking about the camera, when people only buy phones to shoot photos when they need to? Does this mean Apple only makes phones for taking photos?
Fanboy damage control..
Still a bullshit like a previous one. Nothing innovative here. Sorry for your disappointment apple fan boys…
I love your reviews ! But feels like getting paid from apple for this one..
I'll pass and wait until generation 18 or so......
2:24 school fights 💀
Did you install a 3rd party software like Metapho to see how may assets a portrait or a live photo has? I ask this because in the photo album the info about size that I see in my 14 pro max is only about the still pic or the HEIC, when in the reality when shooting live or portrait the iPhone stores at least 2 "big" files instead of just the HEIF or JPG in normal photos.
the fact that i got an ad for it
De pen de joven
14:49 This video was mind-blowing! I did not expect such a high quality video from a smartphone!
If you align all the I phone 12 to 15s... it's really hard to see the difference. Apart from usb c , I don't see much difference from last year's  I phone. I hear all my friends say, "hey the new I phone is coming and I get it". But the real sad story is , most of them use it for taking photos on auto mode, may be take videos, use social media. Not a single person could see the difference in using these different phones
The only real update is with only the price 😂
19:45 the bigger screen isn’t a reason why
Many of these features are iOS 17 👌
Snacks
Voice isolation already on 14 pro max😮
Yes! Your point about the bezels are so true! I use an iPhone 14, and i am blown away by just how small they managed to get the notch when I compare it to my dad’s iPhone 11. Even though the notch on the 11 isnt that big, me being used to the tiny one on the 14 makes it feel absolutely enormous.
I am tired of you being such an Apple fan boy...
that doesn't look or sound like a review, sounds like a paid ad. sounds like you're literally trying to sell the phone to me. how much did you get paid by apple to make this "review"?
Using the action button to open a tesla. hmm a good idea
Where are the bad things about this iPhone,  only good things??
OFC its better than we think. Its the same bullshit like Iphone pro 14. Just a better procesor nothing else.   I also have an Apple Iphone 13 mini for me the best product of Apple. Normal ppl listen to me its total stupid to buy every year a new Iphone just buy every 5 year. Apple dont make far progression with Iphones
How does 2x-3x look on the pro max ? Saw some videos  with a lot of assumptions
your fiancé is Mia Khalifa??
Arun finally drank the Apple Kool-Aid 😂
sadly smart phones have been perfected so much that the only stuff that is super insane is the small stuff no one would notice :( am excited to see the AR and VR industry to grow until can have devices so small and seemless that they become an actual replacement to the smart phone, only then can we get some REAL changes that we can be truly excited for.
I got realme 24gb ram / 1tb storage already
Gen z is asking why are you taking photos in landscape 80% of the time😅
The only thing worth getting this is because of the gaming part,everything else is a stretch even Arun himself I noticed  is not that excited because there's almost nothing to talk about.
IMO the best thing that could happen to iPhones is to allow them to use Nearby Share with android devices I'm sick of iPhone users not being able to transfer files normally...
Can you make a video of all the iPhones cameras from the first iPhone to the latest one?
Apples and oranges......🤷🏽‍♂️
Forget the review, this video is so fun and well done
To this day, I still wonder why reviewers place so much emphasis on fingerprints.  I mean, you touch it, it will have fingerprints.  That’s like a car review going on about shoe prints on the floorboards, or a house review complaining about fingerprints on the kitchen faucets.  Each time I hear it, I’m like ‘Is there really little else to discuss at this point?’ 🤨
YouTube channels are overhyping Apple  products these days.
how did youtubers get the 15 pro so fast? mines coming the 22nd
I feel like too much attention and mention is paid to how many fingerprints are on the side of the phone. Like, who literally cares in real world use? 😂
When someone has to make a video titled "better than you think", you have to understand, the phone is not built around the user, the user is trying to build themselves around the device. I will never understand apple fanbois/gals.
What wallpaper are you running
Guess who get paid by Apple... It's just look like a 1500$ update... 🤷
If you 2x crop into a 48MP image, you get 12MP, cause that's how area works. Where do they pull 24 out of? Yes, you can bin pixels out of 48MP to make a 24MP on the 1x, and you can get exactly 24MP on the 1.5x, but the 2x can't be 24MP.
Mega pixel 😂 no google pixel harm in this video
good review! im upgrading from 12 pro max.
Looks Like Arun Is Trying So Hard To Somehow Justifying Why This Is A Better iPhone Then Last Year. 🙄
I know the PS4 is 10years old now, but it’s crazy to me that a phone is more powerful in raw computing/graphics performance (teraflops).
iphone 15 sucks no one is going to bad unless they have iphone 8 even then i would upgrade to iphone 13 or 14 because it would be cheaper
I want it!
OK; we understand, you get paid to enhance good stuff ... Thank you 😀
Why is the time diffrent on both phones in this clip 4:21
I still don’t care. I have been a diehard Apple fan for 25 years. I used to watch the keynote every year with bated breath. I used to get a new iPhone every year. I still have a 12 pro max. They haven’t had a new feature that matters in years. I am just bored with them. I have NEER remotely considered moving to android and still won’t. But I find myself looking at android phones.
Why these tech YouTubers are trying to sell minor changes like if were idiots… This smell like merchandise, just like MKBHD
I always watch your videos before mkbhd’s video
At this point I think that even apple watches his videos to know what good they did
So with all these, is it a worthy upgrade from an iPhone 14PM for an average user?
Wallpaper link?
Not the phone is trash don't Believe this guy.
Man you are good. Best review better.
Idk why I’m watching every review like i didn’t already bought them
when the samsung s24 ultra comes out can you compare them
2:05 millimetres away from the volume button that does the same thing…
Sellout
is the backtap feature the reason why I always see iPhone users with their flash light on? I'm an Android user since iPhone 4, so I wouldnt know
Ok so buy iphone 15 for the camera that's it lol
Next level copium, same shit different number. Not a single person is gonna give a solitary fuck that you can zoom in a little more. All for the small pricetag of 1200 dollars.
I was gonna get an M2 MacBook Air, but now I don’t think that I should get an iPhone 15 promax, same price. At this point it will be better when the iPhone 16 releases.
The gaming on the phone is cool, but I doubt it will catch on. Most people who want to game on the go, already own a switch or steam deck. As well as the assumption people have that phone games should be free, and not many people owning top end flagships, the cost of porting probably wont be worth it as apposted to porting your game to say thr switch. i doubt it will catch on. But its very cool tech and i hope eventually even mid range phones can handle it so good ports of games are standard on phones
Hi my friend, thanks for all the videos you and your team put on. You bring clear happiness in my life, you lift up my mood man.   I had one misunderstanding though, about the 24mpx and 48mpx difference. I though the main wide camera was 48mpx. When is it becoming 24? Didn’t quite understand, if anyone could clarify this for me please.  Best to all.
how do you charge it with the provided cable if they don't provide an outlet block?
I guess I won’t have a cell phone anymore until a company makes smaller compact phones. Why are we going bigger? Just like back in the 80s ugh
They are recycled garbage. iOS 17 is not that great either. I’ll stick to my iPhone 11 Pro Max one more year.
The difference between the 15 pro and the 15 pro max is 200$ not 100$
I think you should buy the most dangerous tech on the internet  It will be so cool Just make sure it's safe
iphone 15 pro max ultra flip 5g save you from a car crash satellite wifi edition with usb-c (because the EU said so)
15 Pros changes over the 14 Pros:(1)Titanium frame, (2) Slimmer bezels, (3)Action Button,(4) USBC, (5) Periscope Lens in PM (5x zoom),(6) A17 chip (Faster, more power efficient), (7) Wifi 6E, (8) 8GB Ram, (9) New Ultra Wideband chip (more power efficient), (10) New Qualcomm X70 chip (more power efficient, faster average speeds, improved coverage, better signal quality, lower latency), (11) Able to charge AirPods or Apple Watch (via the USBC port), (12) Thread radio only phone to have this (able to control Thread-enabled smart home products), (13) The main camera can output 24 megapixels photos, (14) 48 megapixels main lens outputs 24 megapixels photos, (15) Sparital video
big problem is that its made & owned by Apple so theres that little issue.
OH MY GOD I can't believe I didn't know about the back tap feature!!! That was such a clutch mention!!!
Tremendous review with an outstanding indepth explanation of the new camera systems. Kudos bud 🥇
Nice video. I dont upgrade often and I’m rocking a 12. Might upgrade but still leaning towards possibly waiting to see what Apple does next. My current device still does everything i need it for perfectly.
Did you check if the third party USB cables run weaker than Apple USB cables?
Can't wait for mine to come now more then before.
0:24 MrWhosTheBean
One day my comment will be viral like Corona virus😅
but why waste water tho?
There is no difference dude.
voice isolation was already a thing, i use it everyday in my iphone 12
Have you ever heard the saying flogging a dead horse? This is kind of like that
K but can we talk about the 60hz iPhone 15.
Voice isolation isn't new though? I have it on my 12 Pro...
I love the effort that Arun puts into his videos
Let wait for another video where Samsung destroys iPhone in camera’s fyi I’m iPhone user
Definitely seems like a plug...
If the price wasn’t a sadistic joke I still wouldn’t experience any desire at all to get it … unless they kill my current phone with ios17. So I guess that will happen. But then there’s the indefensible price.
The 5,556 comment
No thanks will be passing this iphone what's the point to update from iPhone 14 pro max
gta 5 on iphone
Goat
Arun try to make a video without mentioning his fiance challenge - IMPOSSIBLE
On my iPhone 14 pro i have had it for 9 months charge with MagSafe and I’m on 94% battery health -_-
typical Apple - half a job on everything except what everyone cares about... cameras and gaming 🙆‍♂
The only thing u can see is that Arun is just a another fanboy of Apple…
iPhone 15 pm or flip 5?
love the editing made my video lag on my old laptop lol
We still need to realize how manufacturers are taking us as fools. Adding a "quick action button" to justify an upgrade? It works. We are just a mass of idio..
wallpaper 1:22 please????
The fact I had to watch a iphone 15 ad to watch this video 😅
Regalaliiiiii
My guy literally said that the iphone 15 has no difference to the 14 and then went on to brag iphone on how pretty much all they did was improve things we already had going pretty well.
The voice isolation feature during a call has always been there? At least on the iPhone 11,12s I have used on previous iOS’s..
All apple phones are better than you think. Android fanboys just can't stop coping enough to realize it.
Half way in - as someone who's been a developer for almost 20 years, and leads teams, I must notice something - most of these features are purely software based. Apple is unlocking them based on the device you purchase - you're not actually purchasing a device, you're purchasing software features, but it wasn't like that before (older phones would get features that they can support with their hardware).
Coolest review with good effects ❤
Where can I download the wallpaper?
18:43 accidentally name drops 😂
Voice isolation has been around for years 😊
Perfect phone❤
What a YAWN product....
Great video, where is the wallpaper from?
It definitely takes a lot of skills to be able to do a sell speech about a phone which has zero innovations as compared to the previous generation. I'm genuinely impressed.
I always take mrwhotheboss opinion when it comes to buy new phone, but here I feel like it's more about propaganda to apple than a genuine analysis, that's my opinion
wow
Where’s the wallpaper from? Looks sick
i prefer they focus on more quality photos/video and not making iphone a gaming console, omg.
Amazing 😍😍😍
@callmeshazam  How do people still love iPhone
Has anyone got a link to the purple wallpaper used on the iPhone 15 pro in the video?
The Android iPhone  As an Android guy I can tell all you apple fans this is the phone you can upgrade to 👍 (looks pretty fun)
I got sold after this review for the ip15p max, but was wondering if this would be a worthy upgrade from my s23u or not? Need help on the right advise for this.
I use my phone in my left hand so it’s easy for me to hit the action button
All the reviewers are talking the same things written for them by a company of phone they review.  Especially big phone makers like Apple, who are doing nothing to improve theirs phones, they are meme every year with their "innovations". Nobody is talking about how "big phone companies" are launching same phone every year and expect you to buy it. Of course with so many sheeps around the world it's easy money and for the so called "reviewers" it's a job well paid from phone companies. We have no future with unrealistic opinion. I mean the guy has the apple phone for everyday and he said himself that he's locked in apple ecosystem. 🐑🐑🐑
You should've testted pubg on it
How are you people ok with that stupid black bar on your phone
i have a question, huawei uses Hisuite to transfer images and stuff like that or thats atleast what i need to do, but it needs me to get a code from my phone and go on settings on my phone but the screen is broken, what do i do???? (i just want someone to help me, please)
I think iPhones are great even though I've preferred Android for a long time. I think you did a great job of highlighting the upgrades. Nice 👍🏼
Because of you talking i couldn’t hear the music well
Holding the iPhone with your left hand, which I just realized I subconsciously do makes the action button easier to press than the power button. Not helpful for my 13 tho :|
Unrelated but the wallpaper your using in the thumbnail and in the video is sick.  Would you mind saying where you got it from?
Got an iPhone 15 ad at the beginning of the vid ...lol
The Oppo Find X5 Pro also can shot HEIF images in night mode and normal mode at 10 bit, but not gonna lie, the portrait thing is great, it's something Steve Jobs wanted to do with the iPhone. Several years later they made it true with this generation 👍
that 1200 usd phone cost us 2500 in the nz
Only apple fans consider this a upgrade.
The voice isolation was added in iOS 16, it's not a new feature...
I stoped buying iPhone 5 years ago because of there reluctance to go USB c and now will not buy a iPhone ever again.
I'm tired of buying the same design 😂😂😂😂😂
I can't wait for mine to come in this week 😬
please speake about huweai meat 60 pro
How much they pay you for this , bleee
Speaking in the name of normal, average users, these phones bring nothing new and significant. However, in the name of smartphone enthusiasts, there are just couple of more insignificant features. And about games, I got xbox and my pc for them 😂
I can't stop loving this guy 😍
I just want usb c airpod max sooner than later
Another a bit better than previous, boring iPhone.
"Isolation mode" < "normal call in realme x2"😂😢
For all of you that don’t know as this YouTuber failed to mention.. the voice isolation feature has been available for a few iOS updates and it’s on any phone that can run iOS 15
I just ordered my 15 Pro Max. Can’t wait.
Voice isolation? Lmao my pixel has had clear calling forever. iGarbage always playing catch-up
Can I connect the phone to screen and play the playstation games ? How the games work? What we need ?
Am already in the MEGA PIXEL mode 😊
Am already in the MEGA PIXEL mode 😊
Is it $200 increase or $100 increase? I did the math and it's not mathing.
Mega..... Pixel.... So cringe arun 😂😂😂😂
Compare with Huwai mate 60 pro
The 14 has voice isalation
Rinse and repeat from apple
Imagine playing gta 4 in there
Still not possible to press pause while taking a video and then continue filming afterwards.
Beautiful work. Just waiting for your give away
It did not just happen, they were forced to
Voice isolation i think is inspired by nvidia broadcaster AI and this feature is very helpful i use it on my pc when i stream or when im in a meeting and every phone should have it
Sim ejection tool?
My iPhone has had voice isolation forever
Yawn ….
What’s the wallpaper at 1:23?
I can safely say that Arun is in the lead this time. The best, most researched video on the 15 Pros is THIS ONE.
I’m still schilling with my standard 12 that I got 3 years ago and my cable that came with my phone charges my phone in like 20 minutes
15:00 Portrait mode looks so fake 😅 compared to my 85mm f1.4 L lens on my full frame mirrorless.
Sim eject tool and SIM card tray! I’m jealous!
where did he get the Wallpaper????
I feel sorry for all the  people that change iphone every year. Sending prayers...
Retreat getting the 15 not pro
will you be doing a android 14 or one ui 6 review?
Can I get an iphone😢
That gaming thing has made me decide to upgrade 😮
When you were playing resident evil did you get hot or did it dim?
"Software runs better on Apple computers because they're optimised for M2". Yeah, the dumbest take ever.
Why does it seem that every reviewer glances over the fact apple were forced to add usb c and they purposely restrict the speed on a $800 phone.
anyone know where i can get that purple wallpaper??
Be honest chat - Who benefits from the faster transfer speeds possible because of the usb-c? and Why?
This channel has become everythingapplepro except you're kinda funny
2:37 you can use the volume button to take photos and videos on Android and iPhone. I just don't like the action button, the mute switch was a nice iPhone touch that's been on iPhone since the beginning
apple has finally decided to start paying you reviewers. another year half of the video about taking pictures, if everybody wasn't so delusional about a single pixel we would have a decent battery life in a smartphone by now.
The “AYO CHILL” 💀💀
You didn't even talk about the 48mp pro raw? No comparison there no?
Which one is better the iPhone 15 pro or iPhone 15 pro max because l am getting one in Black Friday
i still am unsure about upgrading from my XS Max to the 15 pro max, i feel like im not really getting much here. my XS is pretty much still capable to serve me for 1 or 2 years but at the same time i feel like i want a new phone.
Why does it come with a sim injector tool when it is an e-sim?
😂
Ty ios but I like my pixel 7
I am just amused by turning pictures into stickers so I can make my own crazy faces and memes in iMessage haha
is this still embargoed for reviews or is it safe to buy?
What if I wanted to charge my iPhone through my computer would my phone charge my computer?
Pro max photos though?
I mean you could already use the volume up button to do the same exact things in the camera app soo 😅
I'm upgrading thanks to Anz!!! thanks bro!!
Voice isolation was already on iPhones before iPhone 15 came out
What I don’t get is why the iPhone 14 pro doesn’t get the new portrait stuff from Apple when the regular iPhone 15 does, it’s the same chip in both. The iPhone 14 pro should get all the new camera stuff that the iPhone 15s get.
15 vs 15 pro which has better battery?
cant they just upgrade the ui and software instead of releasing a whole new phone-
Did people forget that volume buttons can be used as a shutter button for pictures/videos?
"Ayo chill" got me rolling 😂
My teacher is going to be mad that it is not the mute button
I've always loved Mr. Whosetheboss' videos. Clear, straight to the point, and always hitting us with the best details about anything, while still making it fun and enjoyable. Kudos!
maybe.but still not enough to make me ditch my 14 pro max.
7:50Ayo bro it’s just a phone
Arun may I please have your ps4, if you're no longer using it
They put ZERO effort on this Iphone because now theay are interested in selling VR headsets
No charger in the box how is that even legal, and a slower charging cabel. WOW pretty bad start.
Ha that voice isolation mode reminds me of the tech in my Phonak hearing aids!
did you play around with this a lot
iPhone 15 Pro - Pro in name only! I am not spending that huge amount of money without ALL the cutting edge features! 15 Pro max is far too large for me. I am extremely annoyed by the lack of the 5 x optical zoom on the 15 Pro. Keeping my money in my pocket and waiting to see next year if they see sense with the 16 Pro. If not, the 15 pro will already by much cheaper by then!
10:32 i got the same feature on google pixel 4a
When is the giveaway
Every year the reviews are the same
Bro, I’m not even kidding my Siri thought that I said her name  and heard what mrehotheboss said yes I know I spelled his name wrong and Siri said thank you
🤷🤦 iPhone 15😂 16 13-14🤦🤷
Great review but you’re really reaching with this 😂 android has buried Apple at this stage
na i sill don't like iphone
13:47 colour gradation also went down
6:51 ahh how did u catch that
Looks like the 14 pro max
I didn't feels like watching a 20 minutes review video just now...
I phone :D
Im not interested at all that the iphone can run a game at 720p when you can just run cyberpunk with stadia years ago in 1080p and some games in 4k. Cloud gaming can give you actual pc enthusiast level graphics.
bro use the orange cat as the iphone stand . NICE
They very clearly aren't releasing the same phone. While the additions may be subtle enough for almost all Android fans to overlook, they have attention to detail that couldn't possibly be overlooked by anyone.
Why don't we get in depth reviews of other brands like this?
Apple : we will not spend on innovation, we'll just pay phone reviewers.
Aron is the only person that makes me believe that iPhone is actually a good phone
I am underwhelmed with every iPhone release. I guess that makes it easier to stick with my 13 but still. There is nothing exciting about iPhones anymore. Been like that for a while.
Stop the hype pro..
How much apple pay to you
Great review very easy to listen to and entertaining. U have a new subscriber.
Pre-ordered it on the day. Watching these hypes me up even more!
I can afford. Just a waste of money getting damn near the same phone🤷🏽‍♂️
The voice isolation feature is not a new one though. I have an iPhone 13 and I am using the feature for quite a few months now and it's super helpful❤. Works with most call related apps but doesn't work with in game microphones
1:44 I’m left handed. So I can reach it easy. ( at least the mute switch on the 13 pro max ) I’m guessing it’s just as high up on 15 pro max
Wow it’s here?!
I thought all iPhones that can update to iOS 16.5 have voice isolation? Meaning it’s not a new feature because I have this on my iPhone 13 Pro Max lol
Voise isolation is available on iphone 14 too so this is not for iphone 15 pro
5:49 meaty? 😳🤨😩
I’m so proud of how far you have come. 16 million subscribers that’s crazy. I didn’t even realize it was that high yet.  Your videos are so much more pleasurable to watch. The lighting, ambience. Awesome job man I remember when you were at 300k
do you have on nail polish or am i trippin
12:41 14 pro looks like it could be the selfie camera for new iphone 😊
Nice...u r the BOSS
Ahh, Apple could not include a proper high speed USB 3 cable...which costs $1 to manufacture, probably less with their huge purchasing power. But it's ok, you can buy one later from them for only $14.99
not worth it 🤣🤣🤣
Looks these influencers don't want to say anything against iPhone 15
amazing upload scedule
Wow £1200 for a normal usb c charger.. you dont even get a fast usb charger lead. Apple really know how to steal your money. They've been doing it since the iphone 7 😂
Also I’m really mad why did they take deep purple away
The Mr Bean part 😂
I just bought the 13 pro max cause I needed a new phone sadly my 6p iPhone died and a $1000 or more is redonkulous I got mine for 740$ with a case and mag wallet which is still expensive but it was cheapest in my area
apple sells us the same phone with small improvements, so I don't recommend this phone at all, plus you can't repair it yourself in case you break it
@13:54 when you say "when you do this, you're not using the full extent....image quality isn't as high", do you mean when you crop with the 1x lens? Or use the 28mm or 35mm option?
Ooh , awesome 👌
Congrats. Only person to point out the stupid action button is in the wrong place for a camera shutter button
To be honest, that’s a review 😅🫵🏼👏🏼
I have 2 questions: - how is the battery life of the Iphone 15 pro in comparison to the 14 pro? - how much heat produce the new 15pro when its charging in comparison to the 14pro
5:10..Milo as the phone holder 😂
Pov me watching this video with android 😅
This review is great, best tech channel I’ve ever seen
Apple users be excited for anything apple throw at these RTRDS 😅 what da phak 😂 android did this ceat like 5 years ago bisses.
Voice isolation already works since ios 16 with all phones and with airpods
So I need to buy a new rooter too
Pricing sucks in some countries. Like here in the Philippines, the base iPhone 15 is priced at $1000 while the 256gb iPhone Pro Max is priced at $1500. Like, WTF?!
So you buy a Pro to get the high transfer speed and get a cable that doesn’t support said speed.  Because……….. the environment or something.  Couldn’t you at least lie to us, Tim Crook?
Lol
The whole video only Shouts  SPONSORED POST 📯📯
Most of the people who use iphones have a case, so i'd argue that the edges honestly don't really matter
Like a Porsche 911. Evolution over revolution. You should have a good argument stating that the 911 is not the best sports car in the world.
I'm going to comment as I go: 1) Action button as a Camera Button: I personally do not agree. Yes it's quick and easy, but a) still unreachable, specially for someone with hands as tiny as me, and b) you can't hold the phone in a comfortable position without either covering the camera lenses with your hand or taking the picture in vertical mode. I would use the power button/back tap for this same reason (which I actually don't, I just swipe left while on my Lockscreen and I'll have my camera ready). I never liked the action button, the mute switch was perfect as it was. 2) Voice Isolation mode: ok, that's actually very impressive if it is the way that is shown in here. Since this is Mrwhosetheboss, then I'd say it is very accurate.  3) Nothing to say about performance. Not the fields I'm interested in as I'm too basic with the use I give to my phone. 4) Nothing to say about the materials and fingerprints showing. I use a case. 5) Camera: overall impressive. Nothing to add. My only point of comparison is iPhone X, my current phone. I think this is a feature for actual photographers, and I bet they have their own opinions whether the iPhone 15 Pro is actually useful for them. I am not. 6) Nothing to add on the rest of the video.  Overall, nice, definitely not the phone I would upgrade to (not that I have the money anyways, because I don't).
Iam a bighanded lefty, action button is in a perfect place🥵
I can’t wait to switch to the iPhone 🔥
Better than we think cause apple paid u
Someone please tell me where I can get that wallpaper he’s using?
the question is , will battery last an hour of vatching YouTube?
Woah, that reference to AC Bloodlines took me back.
I'll stick with my Poco F3. Thanks
It feels like a spor
sorry mate, but its a phone you switched too cause u can afford it - might have even got it for free from a supplier. plsssss , im sticking to my 14 pro max.  good video tho ur entertaining
13:18 you can see all those photos of the grass he took in the speed test lol.
Someone please tell me where I can get that wallpaper he’s using?
Love the vids bro as always 👌🏼 But is it better than the 23 ultra? As I am do an upgrade
Great!!! Going to have to buy a new phone😉😉🤣🤣
THANK YOU APPLE FOR MAKING THE SIDES TITANUIM INSTEAD OF STAINLESS STEEL.
Stop fooling people...
Great discussion on the camera differences IRL. On paper, doesn't seem like a lot, but you did a good job in showing the improvements.
This feels like a sponsered ad from apple.
Surround speakers?
Dod jerry riggeverithing buyed one? 😅
nice
It’s a game changer for me. Literally, a game changer
Very good unboxing video 👌🏼 A giveaway of iPhone 15 Pro?🥰
Honestly no different from the previous phone. They bring a new phone out every year and they are never any different. They do it knowing that people just want the latest shit. If they brought one phone out every 3 years there would be major differences and people will actually look forward to it.
The Voice Isolation mode is not new I’ve been using it with iPhone 12 Pro max since a long time
I would consider an iphone if they would have something Samsung's Dex feature, that way I could just buy a monitor and have my iphone as CPU LOL... with all that CPU POWER honestly!!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏🏻, Awesome review!
I wonder if he noticed that he had his flashlight on during part of the video
Your videos are the first ones I watch when I get on YouTube
This is the only review for the iphone 15 pro’s that managed to keep my attention considering it’s almost 20 minutes. Good job my man. Subscribed
Good review, but the voice isolating on calls are already on the iPhone 14pro and my iPad to be honest great feature tho!!. This review does make me want to upgrade damn you sir! 😂
Can you share the wallpaper?
dude for real the voice isolation has been there since iPhone 12
Sitting down with all my food to watch the iPhone 15 pro videos since the embargo is over 😂
1. *Buy for Longevity*: Choose a device that you can see yourself using for several years. 2. *Recycle*: Make use of electronic recycling programs. 3. *Repurpose*: Before throwing away, see if the device can serve another purpose or be given to someone else who can use it. 4. *Educate Yourself and Others*: The more people know about these issues, the more pressure there will be on companies to act responsibly. Consumer awareness and demand for sustainable practices can drive change.
You should start using chapters for your videos.
i've watched every iphone review of Aruns even i dont have iphone :D
iPhone 15 pro is absolutely awesome ,  it's definitely on a new much higher level, quality simply blows away all opposition
I would love a iPhone 15 Pro vs Pixel 8 Pro camera video...
Enjoying your thrilling content from my Galaxy Z Fold 5. It's like watching a f*cking blockbuster. Props to you!
Im waiting for an Iphone fold
Cool review. But pardon me the gaming on a phone still seems hilarious to me. It's cool you can pair a controller to the phone. Controller is larger than the phone. Its just... besides playin while on a toilet i can't say gaming is the way to use the new powers of the phone lol.... Okay watching further - can't help myself but feel that it's a biased paid review. You are creaming over the "new design" where it's just brushed titanium that picks up fingerprints like crazy and a micro curve to the phone. The bezels are pretty much the same. Imo MKBHD is much more unbiased review
im watching this on a mac pro, the blue one you showed in the vid 🤣
Bruv... Why is your content soo similar to mkbhd's???
I request u to also do for new Huawei phones 🙏🙏
Can't wait for the camera comparison between the S23 ultra and the 15 pro max.
😅😅😅
Voice isolation mode has been around for a while, at least on my 13 Pro Max.
Better to go for 15pro max 👍🏻📲🫶🏻
Did they fix those horrible antennas yet? I'll wait...
whats the app you used to measure the bench marks at 4:14?
crap upgrade.. 13 pro max is still the one to get
The whole idea of going to Crown is seeing u in video wall
How much did apple pay you ?
The problem with a physical shutter button is that when you press it you will most likely shake the phone or move it, so your shots will most likely be wonky or shaky
The iphone 2 can already do all that
Bruh stop sponsoring apple 🍎 😂😂😂
Thank you for this video.  It helped me make the decision to stick with my 12 mini for another year at least.
Not Mr Bean 🤣
so its like an IOs update that cost 1k.
Is this a PlayStation ad? I see a lot of PlayStation rather than the iPhone 🤣
Im going from iPhone 11 to iPhone 15 pro!!!
14:47 blew me away
Video 194: waiting for Arun to heart my comment
15 Pro Max is an extra $200* in price.
Can't wait for the comparisons! There is no doubt that they're gonna be app-ealing (I couldn't think of anything else haha).
Action Button + Camera ... Your'e Holding it Wrong (sorry, had to).  But why not just use your thumb on your left hand to hit the button at the bottom of the phone; that way the camera lenses are in the spot you expect/want them
i swear voice isolation has been a thing for the iphone 14 already? i got it on my 11 rn?
We literally evolved from horrible pathetic notch design into functional and nice looking pill shaped dynamic island. And I am happy with that
mate sort out your nails is gross. and iphone 15 its the biggest mistake for apple to make. i will stick with iphone 14 pro max 💯
Wallpaper?
@Mrwhosetheboss  Can I get your iPhone 13🥺
tis the time where the world must choose between mrwhosetheboss videos and console gaming on iphone
I have a feeling iPhone 16 pro will be the real deal and now we got 14s 🤔
Nice video!!! I wish they had made the pro version in the light pink color too 😍
Please give me one business has been stale
Better than u think? Erm NO, I was going to switch back to an iPhone from my Samsung, then looked at the specs, and the same old same old style,and the poor battery and so on….. think I’ll wait for the upcoming S24ultra, it’s not that I’m against apple at all, I’m actually heavily invested in apple,but sorry this iPhone dosnt scream quality or style or out right the best,only the chip is outstanding and frankly that in its self is overkill for what you need
Damn, how were you soo calm 😂
Why is Mia khalifa in a Tech vídeo?
Subbed & Liked! Enjoyed the video! Good work!
Me watching this knowing damn well I ain’t getting it for another 3 years
WE WANT TO SEE THE BATTERY LIFE TEST! 😅
Guys should I get the Pro or Pro Max. I like the bigger screen but it’s just too big in my pocket, and I feel too large. But the bigger screen……
How much you got paid for this 😂
There's voice isolation in my iPhone 13 pro max. How's that a new feature?
Android phones have been able to run pc games for years now but its nice to see Apple has started natively supporting it
I'm watching this on an S23 Ultra and let's just say I will get bored more easily of this camera system as the specs are not as high. The image quality between the two can on average be even-even.
Lumia had an "action button" for the camera that I loved and yes, it was in a better location to take photos without blocking the camera. Voice isolation has been around for 2 years if I am not wrong.
where’s the wallpaper guy? need that wallpaper
Samsung needs to return the action button on the Galaxy s24 lineup it used to have it on S10 lineup but they removed it in favor of programmable volume rocker everybody didn't want that extra button back then because it was used for Bixby but was also programmable so I don't know why everybody was making fuss out of it now Apple has it and everybody liking it so I don't see why Samsung removed it in the first place I like that button especially when they added the feature on good luck or you can make it do anything you want Samsung bring it back if you see this
Lens coatings and f stops nothing new Sony and Huawei been doing it for years. Apple brings nothing new hate their processing it's horrid
It's just the same as the 12, 13, and 14. Apple started making computers, they did so much to revolutionize it, and then just slowly added upgrades. They are doing the same with iPhones. They did so much to revolutionize it and now they are fazing out the iPhone and just are slowly adding little upgrades. They are now just going to do the same thing with the VR Vision Pros.
I don't get the obsession with phone cameras.
Review non pro models too pleaseeeeeee
Doubtful it is better than what I think when even the notch design is 15 years behind
This is iPhone propaganda
Me watching this in my iPhone 14 pro max and totally unbothered about switching to type C🚮
It is worse than I thought
Is it worth to switch from iPhone 12PM?
Paid promotion video by Apple
voice isolation isn’t anything new and I dont see any improvement
Please run all these tests again but with an iPhone 14 pro max that hasn’t been upgraded to the latest ios17. Apple has quite the history of reducing the quality and performance of previous generations phones when the latest iPhone is out, thereby affecting the integrity of your comparison test.
You still get the sim card iPhone though 😩😩😩😩😩
Ok so you have not tested battery life yet but already know it will be better than previous model. Nice. Almost all other reviews say the opposite ;)
Why does that blue look purple in so many of these videos I'm seeing. I'm like, is that the 15 Pro, or a 14 Pro deep purple?
Love it. So much info bro. Love your videos. God bless you
80% camera review 15% design  & aesthetics 5% performance review...   a perfect review for iTrards
Everyone is saying nothing new but better. So the question is how much did apple paid you? 😂
I knew people they will make so much noises about this phone especially when apple not bringing anything new to the table....in compare to huawei** they are unique about each devices they produce and more advance in all aspect......i think people like if someone's like apple abuse there right of having more advance devices
Apple - 🥱
Do you think that if iPhone 14 Pro Max phones got a ‘software update’ - there wouldn’t be a need for the new iPhone to use it as a selling point?
Finally. I mean. It was so obvious on your first impression video at Apple HQ that you were not impressed, and now finally and a bit more in depth review
boss you did a way better job than the apple event itself..
Talking like a blah blah blah iPhone blah blah features old feature (type c )😂😂😂in now 2023
The volume button already acts as a shutter button in camera mode though!
Getting hard to find your videos unbiased...
Nice. Buy a pixel
Great need a 2nd mortgage to buy one 💵💵💵💩
"A sub to the channel would be I conic" would have been a better line for today's content.
The only think i dont like is same design in 5 years
Arun teaches me a new word in every video 😂
Voice isolation would be good for audio recording :)
5:38 and a 15 pro costs more than a ps4 and a decent 144hz monitor combined💀💀
Arun teaches me a new word in every video 😂
when someone spends 3+ minutes on a hard to reach remapping button! And marks it as a feature you know where the video is going
What walpapers are you using in the 15 pros?
Arun teaches me a new word in every video 😂
Hey Arun. Just wanted to say that your videos are just getting so much better. Your editing and video style is unmatched. Great review as always. Thanks for the information I didn't know (as always)
Most disappointing iphone yet. Not upgrading from iphone 14 pro max. Infact with such a boring iphone 15 pros, i am switching to android fold this year. Apple has derailed from its formal innovation path and lost the vision. Only one word - DISAPPOINTMENT
best early review out there the rest are just unboxing even mkbhd is disappointing this time
Lol what a joke of a phone.
can we talk about the fact that aaron is walking in public with the popping bloons btd6 shirt. what a chad
Voice isolation isn’t exclusive to the iPhone 15 right ? It comes with the software I have it on my iPhone XS Max.🤔
Slowly adding features that android already has doesn’t make me want a new iPhone that looks like my iPhone 12
Arun, keep shining brother. Awesome and concise content. KEEP IT UP❤❤
Deadist updates ever cant afford one with current economy
Meh
Where is your wallpaper from?
Actually your Vedios and reviews are on the other level but if you wanna make them more interesting,please remove the background music in them coz we forget about the content and end up listening to those beats 🎧
Giveaway 💩😭
Why is his ps5 gold lol
Such a great video. Presented well, engaging…subbed
Me with my iPhone 14 pro max two weeks ago: I love this phone ❤. Me now: I want a 15 my 14 isn’t good anymore it’s too heavy and slow 😂
Next level shit
Voice isolation has been a feature since ios 16 as well :p Been using it on my iPhone 12 mini for about a year
So, I will stick to 14 Pro max
Watch apple cone out with a product with the attachable apple gaming controller like the nintendo switch 😂🙄 that would be pretty nice actually
Arun trying to convince Apple users from getting fade up with 15 pro
16:13 16:13 16:13 16:13 16:13 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 wooooooooaaaaahhhh 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You’re tooooo good bro 🎊🎊🎊🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Now make an iPhone that is half as thin and light
And what stopped them to add newest PE algorithms to 14 Pro at least for main module with latest iOS update as e.g. Google does with their Pixels? Oh, forgot - it''s Apple...
Gotta go get my homework so I can watch this video while doing it!!
Waiting for the all time best battery 🔋 comparison video 🎉❤
I litreally got an iphone 15 ad while watching this vid💀
Where to get this wallpaper from?
We need a video of all of your PUN(ishment xD) jokes!! Love them! Actually one of my favourite thing and always curious what's coming next!!❤
Most neutral reviewer on planet earth.  Unbaised
I don't think I'm going to switch from my 13 Pro this year, although the 15 Pro sounds like a solid upgrade, it's still not enough of a change to warrant me to change phones, I'll wait for the 16 Pro.
I absolutely love your videos thank you so much for taking the time and effort to put these together whilst making them entertaining
dont listen to these sell outs, dont give apple your money.
What?? The standard usb c cable isn’t able to fast charge? Why? I’m shocked
Only the iPhone 15 pro and Pro Max have USB 3.0, The normal 15 and 15 Plus have USB 2.0.
Yeah, apple finally did something which samsung already forgot about it being something new...
7:51 AYO WHAT
Paid by Apple for this video?.. No mention of 60Hz ?!!
Great review, thank you! Why the hell did I not ever know about the double/triple tap feature !! 😂
ARUN RAN OUT OF WORDS FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS OMGGG NOOOOOOOOO
OMG....... features android head years ago.
That megapixel pun caught me off guard😂😂😂😂😂😂
Voice isolation exists on the iphone 14 pro as well, and any other iphone with the latest update.
Omg how did you manage to do that such dents 😮🤯😰
I'm expecting that you will say "it would be 15stic" hahahahaha
you got paid to do this review
I have isolation mode on iPhone 14
This guy is the permanent hater of iphone 😆😂
Titanium Blue is the way to go.. imo MUCH better and classy than natural titanium..
I do like the 15 but with the new button I can do the same thing on my pixel 5😂
the cameras look huge
Still thinks it's unfair, the s24 hasn't came out. 🎲
iphone 11 shape was supreme.  really like the 15 tho
But, But, But, it’s the same thing as the 12, 13, and 14 though, and because I have no money to afford it, I’m sticking to my 12 for another 3 years……..😝
Could you tone down the white flash for your transitions? My eyes are sensitive and I'm sad I can't watch your videos anymore.
Habibi what’s the deal with the bling PS5!
I'm gonna be honest, the iPhone 14 only has minor differences to the 13, but the new 15 is underrated.
🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:  00:00 📱 The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max lack a standout feature, but small details make them surprisingly impressive. 01:09 ⚙️ The new action button on the iPhone 15 Pro is programmable and serves as a convenient shortcut, especially for the camera. 03:03 🗣️ Voice isolation in call quality effectively eliminates background noise, offering a significant improvement in voice clarity. 04:21 🚀 The A17 Pro chip brings notable performance gains, especially in graphics, enabling impressive mobile gaming experiences. 05:45 🎮 iPhone 15 Pro can run console-quality games like Resident Evil Village, showcasing the device's gaming potential. 07:26 📱 The iPhone 15 Pro's design offers a more comfortable, lighter, and practical experience with matte titanium sides. 08:37 📷 The camera system's strength lies in its seamless integration, offering high-quality, hassle-free photography with various enhancements. 13:00 📸 The "seven lenses" claim refers to the multiple focal lengths the camera system uses, not physical lenses, offering versatile zoom options. 16:24 🔋 Battery performance on the iPhone 15 Pro is expected to be better than the 14 Pro, but detailed testing is needed to confirm this. 17:20 🔌 The iPhone 15 Pro supports reverse charging via USB-C, allowing it to charge other devices like AirPods, providing a practical feature.  Made with HARPA AI
How should I download resident evil on my m2 iPad Pro as I already know that it’s supported but can’t find it on the App Store
iphone 13 + nothing = iphone 14 . iphone 14 + usb c = iphone 15 . this is sad reality
A phone who cant even afford to give charger with their box is not worth it. Goldiggers iphone nothing much changed from privious version except they keep reducing components and rising the box price. Whats next removal of screen or battery?
Same shit different year
I think console games coming to iPhones would greatly help Mac gaming
That sneaky *AYO Chill*
"Better than you think" -that's not saying much
3:45 voice isolation was already available since iPhone 12 I suppose
Top $$$ paid to Arun by 🍎 just to make video about nothing new Lol.
The action button is a bit over praised in this video. Samsung had the Bixby button since Galaxy S8 and it is programmable and located below the volume button but Apple is here getting all the praise for a worse version of it.
Its the same phone as last year noting to think about
I’m using voice isolation feature from more than an year ago. It’s an old feature.
ag
How would you design the iPhone 16?
I got the latte ready!!!!!
I appreciate the content, but idc what you say about the iPhone 15, its garbage. Especially when you compare it to other phone companies who actually add new features and change the design.
''If we zoom out"   this was the best review!
Okay but is ultrawide night mode video fixed? If not no upgrading for me
Voice isolation is good but they had that in the iPhone 11 or 12 then took it away on the 13 and now it’s back as a feature !!!!
Just wanted to share that my iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 17 also has this voice isolation feature.
I appreciate the content, but identifies what you say about the iPhone 15, its garbage. Especially when you compare it to other phone companies who actually add new features and change the design.
Crap- I totally wasn't considering moving on from my 12 Pro Max, but now you have me thinking.  Looking forward to the camera comparison to Samsung!
People who are not intrested in camera and photography stay away from this video
Has the standard iPhone 15 got some of these upgrades too? (Besides the camera)
Dang all these tech YouTubers must have been  payed extra by Apple this time. They could’ve unboxed the 14 pro from last year and no one would’ve notice the difference lol. This year is big a skip especially if you have a 14 pro.
Love your stuff but this is some serious Copium of a video my dude.
Being outside on your knees playing Resident Evil on your iPhone with your cat as a holster is insaane
Ok, so the true test for the night mode is shooting Aurora in cold weather
Coming from iPhone 13 6.1 to iPhone 15 pro 6.1 it will be heavier for me according to Apple
🎉
Mashallah Allah make u Muslim ❤
I have never noticed that you told so many out-of-context lies. For example, most phones running Android 9 or later can save photos in HEIF format. This seems to be more paid advertising rather than an objective review
92% battery life after Resident Evil 😅
Good thing is that Samsung gives the option to use HEIF format as well
❤
5:32 Gold ps5 is a paid actor 10:17 Ad worthy
Love the video👍
I like the way when you said pretty at 7:00, it was miss drisha’s face that was showing.... i see you 👀 mrwhosetheboss  i see 👀 you  😉🙂🙂 keep doing it 7:00
Taking up 50% of the video to talk about the camera is just a big Red flag for me.
Arun, I love your video so much, but this video I felt like little bias, sorry if I am wrong..I am a practical person,  As an android and ios user Only thing I can see improved here is the camera and I like the camera features,  You talk about gaming, How fast the battery drains during gaming?? We wish to see all these reallife test because there are lots of people who see and believe your videos for new tech,.New iphone, Still No fast charging after all these years... Seems they are not focusing on common people, My iphone takes almost 2.5 to 3 hrs to fully charge but my xiaomi can be charged 4 times withing that time... for better camera I think its better to get a proper digital camera, The cam battery charges faster than I phone.
voice isolation seems better on android  i might be wrong
Not me watching on my iPhone xr
The voice isolation is available on iphone 13, 14 and 15… just so you know…
Kaise hain Aarun bhai?
holy copium
Paid review??
nice
There was a dedicated camera shutter button on Nokia phones ages ago. This thing needs to make a comeback on other phones as well even if it's a programmable button.
nice wallpaper its stock or where can u download it :D
Hi
Man some of the features you mentioned here are related to the new iOS17 not to the device itself, like voice isolation.
Nah
Yay😊🎉
I like how Drisha is slowly becoming a part of the mrwhostheboss team. Its great to see your team and channel improving on every video
idk why but this was one of the most awaited video of your
Make a battery comparison video and make sure you include iPhone ip 13 pro
was that paid review?
I keep seeing reviewers mention the action button is difficult to access, but as a left hand iPhone user, it’s position is perfect.
I wonder when will he start to use " hello mr" which would be cool in the beginning like "hellow motto" 😂
Blah blah blah. Cr-apple is weird and the only annoyance on this otherwise perfect channel, and I do mean perfect, is hearing you justify this thing. Comparing apple to apple is always going to seem like positive change but googles devices decimate apple camera and software at lower prices.
Why didn’t you show off the Gaming side? Or are games not out yet. That’s the only feature I care about
Apple - reviewers need to work harder y-on-y given the company has lost the i-chip (innovation, intelligent, inventive) all together. Tough life... The promo pain is beginning to show. Time to move on..
What a good cash in account make is impressive.
Arun really gets deep into the little things it makes me want to upgrade
Wallpaper???
it's the saaaaame thing man ffs
which is better feels in hand generally ? because I know that 15 pm has smaller weight , but what about depth? 15 pm has bigger depth and maybe it’s slipperier than 14 pm , because of is used titanium.
Damn, look like the titanium may actually be a downgrade in every aspect bar the weight.
How much nits brightness does the 15 pro max have or is it the same at last year model I see they increased on there new watches why not do the iPhone if it don’t it bullshit have the ultra have 3000nits and do nothing to the iPhones
Ad android user myself all my life ,i admit apple overdone it self this time,this's really impressive,and for the first time in my life I'm excited over an iphone 👍
I want the 15 pro. 😅. 💔
Apple should have used your marketing techniques Arun when presenting the iPhone 15 series, that would make the iPhone more attractive to customers!
It was an excellent review . More negatives than I expected.
And no water was harmed in the video, remember recycling 🗿
But what about the return of Huawei. I am sure it is at least worthy of making a video about, but here u r making 3-4 videos about the new iPhone, which has basically nothing new and innovative. I am sad that with getting famous, u became more biased.
So why does this guy glorify what apple does on camera OS and hardware when samsung has been doing it for months if not years, BETTER, without any merit?
1:00 With (couple of apple stickers) he means, one 😒
Action button for camera use is pointless, you can already take a photo or start a video with the volume up button while in camera mode
You have sold your soul to the matrix , they let you film in they HQ , you convince the NPC’s to buy this scam , you are a bought and sold agent
Okay Arun, hope you get this, the community can help me when they have and have reviewed their iPhone 15 cellphones. I started life as an iPhone user with the 4 all the way to the 6s then I changed to android, life has gotten a bit better and now I have about 4 businesses and one of them is a travel blog/channel I recently started on YouTube, is there a genuine need for me to buy the iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro, or am I good sticking to let's say a 14Pro. Keep in mind I will be using the iPhone for both work and personal life so that I can easily manage my business and personal life. Would appreciate any assistance coz honestly I don't see that much of a change here to justify me buying the 15 over the 14pro
No it’s not better than I think. It’s weird that TSMCs N3 is so inefficient.
3:45 won't improve quality of speech?? 3:33 I actually like the "911" like audio.
On every video, he is getting his wife. Vro that's one of the reason MKBHD comes on every tech showcase instead of your entertainment.
16:10 the pause before the punchline was long enough
Hey Arun you should make a video about the Lenovo legion go
The upgrades are weak . VERY WEAK MY NINJA.
The problem of iphone is the volume not same like android if you on call while watching on youtube you can reduce the volume of audiocall or the youtube imean the android he has  a two volume not same like iphone sorry for English ty
The USB C cables Samsung includes in the box are 2.0 or 3.0? Does anyone know?
Why didn't they bring back the ear phone jack? LOL...
I don't know what everyone see on apple for me Its just telephone like android or something other
I´m sorry, but that included cable speed isn´t justifiable. In any way. Yes, most phones do have "slow cable" because they have a slow USB 2.0. So there´s not an issue. But if Apple says you have fast data transfer for your ProRes footage with that usb-c port because its a USB 3.0 and then not give it to you, that is an issue. Even when sold in millions the cable cost can´t be any significant as it is already 15 years old tech. If it was Thunderbolt enabled then maybe one could understand, but not this travesty that is Apple milking every cent and claiming it on "environment savings." Not happy that Arun is excusing Apple of this.
The correct title should be. Even more boring then you think.
Sooooooo the only thing is the camera lol a joke
Is it just me or do you get excited every time you notice mrwhostheboss has posted you just get rly exited 😂
I have never seen such an informative, well produced piece of work such as this.  Good job for sure...
Trying my best to justify that... iPhone 15 is better...😂
I just got otit
better to buy iphone 14 series 😂
1:43 Left handed people, like me, being blessed for once. We can easily reach it with our thumb
7:12 The couple of marks I've got near the charging port where i have ....missed 😏, got me laughing so hard 😂😂
Did they bring the sim card back, if not I'm still out....
Titanium will not survive the scratches.
Not enough to upgrade from a 13 pro.
Apple fan boy . How much money dose Apple Pay you to make these videos 😊
0:10 I think the one big defining feature you’re looking for that puts the iPhone 15 on the map is the transition of lightning to usb type c          For years androids switched over to type c and left everyone  asking when the type c would come to the iPhones and to finally get it is kinda a big deal
Bro this phone is insane Im curious to see what the S24 does here but so far i just see that it going to be like the s22 vs the 13
I got a 14 pro max 2 months ago and hearing that my previous phone only takes 12mp photos wile the 15 pro takes 24
9:02 does anybody else get weird black fades in their YouTube videos
How many videos can YOU make from a new iphone release?  Lets ask Mr. Owl . . .
Welcome to new episode of can't afford but still watching 😂
Nice vid bro, but that performance though 😅
IPhone 15pro max worst phone ever 👎
USB speeds arent the same between the pro n non pro
3:32  This just backs up my belief that iPhones are just way behind to the superior Androids. This voice isolation is somewhat closer to what the Google pixel has
Bro was using his cat as a stand. His cat must be ashamed
I think voice isolation was there in facetime audio and video call
the shutter button was first introduced in LUMIAS. Those old lumia phones have features which we are seeing now in newer phones. Those lumia phones were great but only lacks software apps
I wish you were a little more honest you were till 0.25 second. FYI I am an iPhone user. This happened to every famous reviewer. See your review as as a smart guy which you are.
Lol the standard cable is an usb 2... that is a year 2000 technology, how can you say its standard with most phones, it is not. That cable is trash, its the only phone on the market that have that outdated cable technology, and if you want that usb 3, this is the standard btw, you have to buy it
I love how when you're talking about how great the thin bezels are, your accidentally covering (maybe even touching) the screen with your fingers just to hold the phone, I miss thicker bezels
truth is apple making money from the name phones don’t  change much
if they ever heard about playstation emulators on android
We can use volume buttons to take pic in iPhone
Weak!!!
Last gen can support HDR
It's a totally forgettable/ insignificant iphone no matter how much u glamorize it . Was thinking finally thinking of getting into ecosystem but wil wait for next iphone 😢
Android user 🎉
literally Apple produced a new camera n charging port only, lol, u r mining what to say thou.
apple ads nothing new tbh you are acting lik a third partyseller
Same shit same phone 😂
by the way on the battery test please for the love of rick astley DIRECTLY compare the 14 pro/pro max with the 15 series
I got rickrolled....
wallpaper please
Time to buy iPhone 13
😅 you know that Arun liked the gadget when he posts two videos in a row about the same thing
Last gen consoles had hdr, that isn't at all revolutionary, very disappointed in that comment
its funny how every creator is just talking about action button as its something out of this world! The fact is there's so less they added in the new phone to even make a 8 minutes video!
I have the 12 pro max and I’m planning on getting the 15 pro max
“Our lightest iPhone pro model yet” 171 grams down from 172 LOOL Apple marketing is insane with all that talk about titanium you’d think it would have had a bigger impact than 1 gram hahaha
i knew this was going to be the next phone for me i knew there was something hidden inside it
I feel like people are getting paid for the reviews hahaha
Full comparison of s23ultra vs iphone 15 pro max
No way! I've still got the best iPhone ever. iPhone 13 mini. It fits in my pocket. It is comfortable in my hands. Nothing replaces its main factor: portability!
Same as the 14
I love zoom lens but I don't like the pro max size. Should I go for 15 pro OR wait for 16 pro ?
😂😂😂 of course it's better now that it has USB C port
Why dont u link the wallpaper? Its kinda rude
Wallpaper?
Is the new iPhone still waterproof in shallow water etc? I remember they had this water ejection system in some of the newer generation, but noted it wasn’t addressed? Just wondered if you’d tested it on this generation?
Would've been nice if there were actual gaming performance benchmarks, fps, and temperature and battery life etc. This review just wasn't thorough enough imo.
Bring in the camera comparison's  🍿
Apple should make a dock that connects your iPhone to Apple TV.. dock it in and continue playing on your tv. Sound familiar😀
Nobody is talking about the RAM size. Rumors says it has 8GB, we need to know.
Customising the action button to be a camera button would seem to be the most common use. I have an iphone 12 pro, which can still run IOS 17, so upgrading may take a while.   The feature is interesting because it is one of the features, I missed from my WindowsPhone. With IOS widgets that look like Windows live tiles and USB C it's getting more like the Lumia 950 every time.
Apple need to get there house in order. Every year you can’t order a phone for weeks and weeks after release. They say good marketing creating demand. All it does is piss people off. To a point il keep my 14 pro max now
This is not a paid ad
Ai Bokeh Mode already there in Xiaomi Phone and works like Charm
Clearly not an upgrade
Does this mean we can expect an new Apple TV Gaming version?
An interesting feature. You could record 4k 60FPS video and output it directly to an SSD through the C port, without storing it on your phone.
8:22 did he just rick roll us?
Thanks for bringing all the old feature to promote the new  iphone, you are the best reviewer i've seen. Now i can see all my iphone 12 feature. Love you❤️
Anyone know where to get that wallpaper?  Thanks!
Nice review
This is a reupload right?
Do a battery test
Save Water
I still am an android guy even if I heavily respect what the iphone can do but HEIF is not and Iphone exclusive, on samsung you can go to camera settings and turn on high efficiency pictures which makes your images save as High Efficiency Image Format, or HEIF for short, quick tip for all the android guys that want some of the features on Iphone but have an android
18:29 int the jump from 999 to 1199 actually 200 instead of 100?
Where can I get that wallpaper? 8:13
Would really want offline game if it weren’t for the fixed non expandable storage.
Drisha just used a lot of freshwater go in vain😂. Your videos are not eco friendly.🤣
Jerry rig everything needs to open this
So as I understand, for an average user there is no difference between 14 pro and 15 pro
Next IPhone 15 Pro vs 14 Pro
ydse
Send me Wallpaper download Link.
After watching lots of video like this, I came to my decision to spend maximum $200 on my phone.
Best 😊
is arun getting better then Marques ?
I’ve been using Voice Isolation for months on iPhone 13 itself with ios16. How is this a new or exclusive feature of iPhone 15 series?
Same shit different number
Ayo chill 😂😂😂
Waiting for 15 pro max vs S23 ultra
As always oveprice garbage, if you want a good Phone just buy Samsung 🤦
My birthday is in November 26. Would be awesome if u gifted me an iPhone 15 of any kind.
Voice isolation is an iOS feature, not exclusive to 15 pro
Bro I’m allergic to titanium
This influencers hyping Apple for literally doing almost nothing is bs! I’m done with tech YouTubers
Batchest so innovating
Omg you guys, Apple is actually getting somewhere
of course mrwhosetheboss is gonna make a video that make apple's new phone look as it was better that it actually is
Missing your passion fruit / iPhoneY product revelations!
THE BEST DETAIL ORIENTED REVIEW I HAVE SEEN! 💯
2:37 jokes on you cus i've always, since the very first iPhone, tilted mine to the right (contrary to the "default") so my right index finger always rested on the volume buttons to use as the shutter. I just wish they could simply add "hold Volume down button a couple seconds to switch off ringing".
Any links on the wallpaper?
Trying too hard to sell iphone. Ridiculous, charging premium dollar to settle with mediocre change. I desperately want to believe this is unpaid review by apple.
I’ve got the 13 pro max, will upgrade to the 16 pro max next year
He is trying to convince people that iphone 15 is better but let's be honest normal people won't even notice a difference.
That is icamera wifh few phony functions .
3:54  Where can I get the wallpaper??
Bro, i can take picture just with my volume button on iPhone 13 pro max and its by default 😂. You talk about taking pictures with the new button and how easy to take pictures with it. Don’t tell me a tech YouTuber didn’t know it
They suck  Gonna keep my xr and not let youtubers do damage control for Apple
If I had just a 13 am ok for 10yrs😢😢
Can somebody help me where can I find the wallpaper on the thumbnail? 😊
@callmeshazzam
Could you do a review of the Mate 60 pro?
Macro mode?
That point of voice call isolation was much needed. You're the only one to point out that practical usage.
What is the thumbnail wallpaper?
Arun always comes in with the clutch
This guy is not honest and has been paid by Apple. Nothing is good from this iphone 15
Feels like most of the stuff is software, that will eventually come on the older phones too, and almost all fratures are available on majority Android phones.
The person that wanted the mute switch to act as another shortcut button definitely got annoyed with always triggering his wallet
16:16 was perfect cmon man I laughed so hard.
Waste of money. Nothing much upgraded from 14  to 15  .
I don't even have a phone that can run Roblox properly lol
Paid
Is 15 pro not e sim? Why does it come with a sim ejector tool?
Need a phone 😢
My Samsung Note 10 Plus beats this rubbish 😂
Common Arun, every year they just improve it but Apple has forgotten how to invent instead just always evolution their prdoucts at all. Whatever they put titanium or new case stuff, it's only making more money from the pocket of the people. They sell now the normal iPhone 15 as something new but it is certainly a one year old iPhone Pro. But i still love your content anyway ❤
I still think is the same phone as the13 pro max
Pro max is $200 more not $100
Sus 🤐 title of the video Apple have worked so hard for a year to change the name of our new iphone from 14 to 15 and it's been really a tough journey Like the new colors and type c
Again  Welcome to the show of " can't buy but still watching " .😂
Which is better 15 vs 15pro or 15pro max?
120hz on 13 pro Dynamic island on 14 pro Usb C on 15 pro   Its got a defining feature 😂 like it was in 13 pro.    CORRECT YOURSELF!!
Hi Arun, tell me about the games, after a few minutes the game starts to crash
It's not better than I think as it's apple and generally not that good of a phone and it's overpriced
Nah, I'm still happy with my 13 PM.
Love you videos been watching for years now!!
I have xr and also voice isolation
@Mrwhosetheboss any chance I could get your old phone? I’m a design student based in Ireland 🇮🇪
What is what Wallpaper on there its sick
If the rumors about the new Switch (also an ARM chip) having power slightly above a PS4 are true then maybe developers can port their games for Switch and iPhone at the same time.
I don't like I phone but I like Ur input
Hi! Amazing video as always! 👍🤜 Can you share link to the displaypicture that you use, looks amazing…..🙂 Keep up your good work!
Has anyone else’s 15 pro max officially shipped yet?
waiting on the se version, not pushed on the camera stuff, once it has usb and a decent battery thats all i care. Besides it could be the worse colour you can get and it wouldnt make a difference It will have a case on it. Dont anyone who uses a phone without some kind of case on it.
If you are reading this, we are the same bro, u and I cannot afford the phone but can't skip the amazing video either.
Wait with Samsung s24 Ultra and you will see the difference
I'm not watching this. But i just wanna say that you've probably been paid for that video title. One day you might get exposed and you'll gonna lose credibility. Keep going.
Oh look a android running ios😂
I swear every time a high-end Flagship comes out, he always makes a video stating how is the best phone ever made😂
The camera is WORST than previous iPhone. Go fanboys, buy it anyway
Can we appreciate how much time Arun spends making these vids for us! Thanks Arun!
Watching this on a $350 phone. Thank god i didn't get the 13 mini. I'd probably regretting it every time i watch an iphone video.  Anyway, i think arun hyped the aaa gaming so much. He even said rog was "bulky with 2 hour battery life". Like wth he had to use a controller - aka another bulky thing to bring - to play aaa game on a very small screen. And he's looking too close to the screen to see what's going on. Obviously very impractical thing to do. And i hope the iphone can last more than 2 hours playing that aaa game.  I'm more interested to know if you can connect your 15pro to a larger screen to play that aaa game, and if it can sustain prolonged gaming time. If not, I would rather encourage AAA games for mobile, than pushing the console versions to a tiny screen.
Can someone please drop the wallpaper
This dude has lost his credibility everytime praising Apple trash products. Better than you think? It's just literally the same iPhone from last year with minor upgrades lol
Let’s home society never moves away from social media. Because otherwise there would be no reason to buy an iPhone
I'll be waiting for that battery test hype hype! Can you also compare it again with the ROG Phone?
More like iPhone 15 camera review
What are you hiding under the gloves? 😂
It is pretty common to all phones not to get USB's high speed from the included cable? Wut? My Samsung S23 Ultra definitel got a high speed USB type C cable. Common...
paid review?? 🤔🤔
Great take regarding the cameras. Apple should really have you work on their launch event script.
Idk how you get that clear pictures but for me taking a group shot from main sensor on heif 48mp max, it still come blurry.
Voice isolation been on the iPhone for years though
Bro became such a sellout
So what's new ?
I'm Apple fanboy and honestly all you just said one daily use is useless and barely noticeable to 99% of iPhone users
Finally i can afford iPhone 8+ 🤗
when you are paid by Apple and have nothing to talk you have to praise weight, color and Titanium frame blah blah blah
Action button is a useless button.
I love watching things I can't afford 😅
I've had an android my whole life, we've always been an android family, and I'm the first person in my family to step into apple. I'm ordering an iPhone 15 pro, should I get it or something else? Budget is absolutely no issue, just wondering if I should look at something else for whatever reason
Anybody has this wallpaper. I love it.
So All the innovations are on the camera? The one thing that means nearly nothing to me and am fine with iPhone 11pro camera
Why Tooex, as opposed to time two?
iPhone Fanboy for the rescue 😂😂😂
I Think This phone So Many Overrated! Only one company in the world who earns 7x the cost of a phone. There is nothing in this phone that other phones don't have. The Apple company is only now running on name. They release the same phone every year, name it and change the chip. They don't want their phones to be affordable by selling them at low prices. Apple keeps everyone curious. Buying this phone means luxury as far as I'm concerned 😑🤮🤮
Helooooooooooooooooooo 1st iphone 15 review!!
Can I use the android usb-c cable to charge iPhone 15?
USBc android has from 7 years 😂😂😂
man, apple got me this time with the cameras. if I had the money I would switch immediately
Compare to Huawei to
My nokia camera is better than iphone camera..i like your video.. dont be  paid youtuber.. show what is right
My man
Great review!
iphone users 🤡🤡
Jeez what a snooze fest. Kinda regretting ordering this thing 😑
1.3M views in less than 7 hours 🔥
1 gallon of water is wasted to shoot this video
i love the voice isolation features, finally my wife won't know im spending time with my lover ! well done Apple ! love you
How much is Apple paying you💀
wait wasn’t the isolation thing on previous ones?
BY FAR the best review I’ve seen so far on YouTube and I’ve seen pretty much all of them. You knocked it out of the park, Arun.
Lets gooo iphone 15 pro i swear I'm going to get a really expensive phone one day because I'm going to be extremely wealthy🤑
Mmm yes i can play games on my phone with half the power of a 10 year old console 😂
So pleased I’ve chanced upon your channel. Taking the leap from an old persons 2g Doro phone to the brand new iPhone 15 Pro Max. (I do have an IPad Air and IPad Pro so am familiar with Apple products). So why the gigantic leap of faith? Because the cameras are breathtaking. I had saved up £1000 for an entry level Canon DSLR with an extra lens. I truly believe the new Pro Max offers superior images with a lot less hassle. Love your channel, subscribed and looking forward to future reports!
How do you the RE game on the iPhone?
i know apple paid you but please do some honest negatives i pretty much heard nothing but good things in this video, which is sad
The best Eva action button 😊
letss goo
Voice isolation is there for 2 year in Iphone
Untangled cable - the best eva❤
voice isolation broo apple nailed it
This is like "the peak" of  tech review!
okay but he went to paddington and didnt tell me 😒
wow sucking up to Apple a lot, shame!
Stil 20W  wired and 15W wireless but NO reverse wireless, still 60Hz display. What a big improvement.
I'm playing pirated assassin cred revolution today 😂😂
are you guys honestly gonna play AAA games on a phone?
It’s the same damn phone man
I'm pretty sure the entire video was shot on an iPhone. Am I right Mr. Boss....?
Lmao his adjectives like the "excuse the bedazzling" are like a bomb dropping b/w the video and that is so funny ngl
its $200  more not $100.
The same with the 14
How much money u got from apple 😂
I noticed that you have Live Photo turned on in some of those scenes. From what I understand, Live Photo reduces the overall image quality of your shots. Probably best to turn it off if you are trying to get the best possible shots for comparison sake. You can also make your phone remember to keep it off if you go into the camera settings in the settings app.
The cableless iPhone is also more for the regular iPhone since the Pro would more likely want higher transferrate with a cable and other features.  USB 3 doesnt necessarily bring in more charging power, it is first with USB 4 it is a requirement to do higher charging power than regular USB, but the USB C connector can support more charging power thereby it was an option for Apple to have implemented it.  I guess we will first see higher charging with next year’s Pro that probably uses USB 4, lol.
While glove unboxing
Mr bean version 😂
When im buying a $1200 phone (which im not) it shouldnt come with a $2 charging cable
I literally got an iPhone 15 ad before this Loll
I fully hope to see the iPhone 15 be the thing that devestates apples image. That its been so long since they truly thought differently. The iphone 15 shiuld have been a milestone phone, with some fantastic, kickass sepcs and brilliant innovation. But its not. Its just the same as the last 5 years work of iPhones. Like sure, theres been small, surface level changes, but nothing that makes this work 2250 (local currency) at base price. When the samsung s23 ultra can perform 4 times better (especially in cameras) and it s several hundred cheaper. Now with USB-C all the apple cronies cant hold onto their precious "oh but my charger argument" i fully expect to see people making the switch.
Xperia had a dedicated camera button since forever
I'm happy the fact that Resident evil Village and 4 Remake got best Advertisement ever 😂
£35 for an adapter and SEVENTY FIVE QUID for a 1m USB cable?? Either Apple are having a right laugh or iPhone users really are that stupid
Can anyone provide me the link for wallpaper showed at start
The s23 ultra photos are nice but wen u soom there Blurry
Voice isolation should be software so we should be getting it on older phones no?
me watching things, which i cant afford
Notable changes TLDR: Action button Voice isolation 10% faster CPU performance  20% faster GPU performance  Titanium body Slightly better cameras and features  5x zooom Type C
Funny that the portrait mode (f changes ) are available on my 3 year old Poco F2 pro for quite a while now 😅
iphone 15 mini would be amazing in combination with the action-button! 😭
Am i the only one who still thinks that these phones are a small upgrade just getting hyped up too much
I switched from 10 years of Android to iphone 13 and this is the buggiest glitchiest phone I have ever used
This guy clearly doesn't want to loa3 his sponsorship
Can someone give me one?
Wallpaper link ?
Peak apple £69 for a plug and £75 for a cable hahaha they should be up in court for that lol
Voice isolation is available in iPhone 11 even before 15 launched, I guess it seems like a paid review to me
It's impressive how you describe the iPhone 15. It's still not time for me to upgrade my 14pro max 😅
I can't afford to buy, so I watch video and fulfill my hobby of buying. 😂😂😢
2:00 Action button on top as a camera shutter is naf. The lenses are in the bottom right. It’s too easy for your thumb to cover the lenses. I would use the action button as a shutter with lenses at the top and button at the bottom.
Me with a Sony
Worst upgrade of all times
My 11pro max sweatin rn
This is exactly what they thought. They knew all from the start their is no substitution to the iphone. Some may argue 😂
My Xiaomi takes 25mp in auto...
It’s literally the same phone
damn that took them so long to upgrade the cables
Is there a reason u don’t use the Apple Watch or is it just not obvious?
Absolutely great and informative video. Thank you so much!
Bro has 25 thousand mails
Can it shoot 5x cinematic videos?
How about the Pro Max having no 3x lens, and the normal pro having no 5x lens?  I think it would be OK, if both had 4 lenses in total. So 3x AND 5x on both.
iPhone now has to be the most boring phone on the market.
Same sh.t like every year :)
Bro those camera features is in Android for quite some time now
Does this imply that the iPhone 15 can connect to SSDs that typically require a complex workaround?
I pre ordered popcorn for this one.
I never liked iPhone and I truly think I never will!🤢🤮
same thing you did say for 14 lol and same blury fotos
Marketing at its best
Motion can be saved in my Huawei nova 7i come on boss, I don't think the camera alone will be enough for someone to buy 15 if he or she has even 13 or 14
Biased
Isn’t voice isolation already a thing? Is it just an improvement?
Bruh Their single core performance is more than my phone's multicore's performance .....
How could you make 90% of these old futures sound like an apple product?
apple has lost all innovation. All their features are from Android phones. Never buying a iphone ever again.
Voice isolation has been around for quite some time, and not just on Pro iPhones, but on regular iPhones too… does it really make sense to dedicate en entire section to it?
That's Awesome
Ok  PC OR IPHONE 15 PRO MAX  in performance  ??????  PC WIN
dude voice isolation is there in 14 pro as well
Apple is officially dead after their new release, no innovation whatsoever, save your money people.
So does it mean iPhone was shit?
Every time a new iPhone comes out it’s like there’s a fight going on in the neighbourhood and people come out in numbers to see what’s happening but there’s always those people (android users 😅) telling others that there’s nothing new to see here it’s just a fight but they quite vested in it themselves, yes we all know androids have been way ahead with features but don’t take away the moment for us to experience the new phones as iSheeps!!! 😂🤣
There's something that I don't get about 4:59 the Play Station, because if you are running the cloud version of Resident Evil from the Play Station console, then it really does not affect too much the hardware, because is not being hosted on your phone 🤔.  As I guess, this is like playing with "Xbox Game Pass" on a PC or any other phone (can't discharge the screen quality nor confirm it tho)
1:43 steve jobs as well as me was/is left handed so he put it there so he could reach it with his thumb
The way  he explained and understanding us makes me to watch his every videos... that is why I love to watch his every video ❤️‍🩹loved it bro
Where can I get the wallpaper you have on the phone at 0.41
Do the UK models come with a SIM tray?
Its annoying me. Nothing is new. NOTHING IS NEW.
My God this is literally what i was thinking! There are the best iphones ever probably the first iphones that i actually like
Original Moto X was peak phone design to fit perfectly in your hand 😎 loved that phone...it's size and how well it fitted in the hand.
the things about AAA Games coming to iPhone is that porting to iPad, Mac, Vision Pro versions will be really easy, same chip architecture, only more cores & GPU, this next chip generation will be great for gaming, also Apple pushing gaming in MacOS
Please give me your 14pro max please 🥺
Guys, I have Samsung phones since the Galaxy S5 till today. I was thinking about to change everything to apple and try if I will like it or not. I know that Android OS is more free and you can just do more. Although Apple seems to be more minimalistic and everyone keeps saying that iOS is better optimized. For me battery life & camera are the most important things.
It is an iPhone, nobody cares away more that ship has sailed. An iPhone 11 with a slow usb c connector
in norway the price of the iphone 15 pro max (price 17.999nkr)  has gone up by 90gbp inn todays currency from the iphone 14 pro max 256gb version at launch (price 16.790 nkr) not felling for buying that phone in norway for that price...
Why does your voice seem off today?
Honestly I gave up on apple and went to Samsung and i gotta be honest best switch imo.
So for an amateur taking just photo’s of people/kids and other things once in a while, a 15 Pro is just overkill.  If you then take away the upgrades of the photo option part of the iPhone 15, nothing significant has changed regarding to the 14 and 13.  Keeping my 1000 pounds in my pocket this year and wait for a real new innovative iPhone.   Would appreciated if Arun made a comparison for “normal users” instead of for the “pro’s”. I already could see the conclusion from that video: JUST DON’T BUY IT AND KEEP YOUR 14 or 13.
So I order the iPhone 15 standard. Worth it or not?
I still wouldn't buy am iPhone
Anyone else not like the gloves?
Not worth the price
The fact that he still uses the golden ps5 cover from that wish video 😂😂
He said nothing in the video that made me go 'it's better than I thought'
iPhone is the definition of ''If it ain't broke don't fix it'' 🤣
what's insane about the performance is that those bionic chip aren't the best gpu wise, snapdragon is ahead and if the leaks are true it's maybe a 50% boost which will be insane, sad those don't run game native because it will be even better than the iphone pro/pro max and maybe 1080p ?
Your videos are the best in tech world. So lively, kinda interactive, has a feel good vibe and has depth too. Appreciate the hardwork. The best in the business. ❤️
Awesome. Gosh . can i have your old used phone...plzzzzzz
Better than s23 ultra?
Probably the only thing I was interested in, you didn't mention! VIDEO QUALITY!
After Portrait Effect Samsung has been providing phones since 2/3 years ago. This is a new feature for iPhone users. 😅😅😅
Nice
I can't wait to get my $1299 powerbank to charge my $699 Google Pixel
Colors even worse
Thraash phone same as 11
Nice
Compare to s23 ultra please
Yaar matlab paiso ke liye desh bech doge kya....Every iPhone is the same since years but still you want to say Great New Feature!! Action button....woww!!
I've watched a bunch of reviews and loved this one the most. So thorough, so good!
How much did Apple pay you? Unsubscribe
Do compare 14 pro max vs 15 pro max    7:47
iPhone's biggest meatrider 💀
Never in my life have I seen people excited over camera, autocorrecting, stickers new contact photo crap Lmaoo 😂😂
It's  worthless  how hard your YouTuber try to  show it and saying  it's amazing  it's great. But  it's still same trash  I phone is trash stop lying
I think your holding the camera the wrong way man 😂

Where did you get that wallpaper?
the most boring new phones in 2023
Such minor changes that feel useless to upgrade 😕
Waiting for the “16 Ultra”
Does everyone seem to be forgetting that you can already use the volume button as the camera shutter button?
@ mrwhosetheboss Voice isolation all ready was on the 14pro max that’s not a new feature
Summary: Apple put 5 year old features and tech on their phones (some by force) and convinced their audience that it's new
6:48 thats so cool man
Great video, but nothing special about the phone. Lol.
iPhone 15 Plus is basically the iPhone 14 Pro Max, except you dont get a tele cam und 120hz. For me, as someone who has the iPhone 6S (i dont care too much about phones) the iPhone 15 Model is MORE THAN ENOUGH for most people. Dont listen to youtubers, do your own research, hold the phone and decide for yourself what you really like.
It’s not better. It’s the same crap every year and people like him are paid to give out a good review
you sound very very sleepy
I'm gonna cry, nowadays everyone is praising apple for shit thats been done to death by other manufacturers. Lets stop praising apple for stuff and lets be honest to them like with any other phone brand. I know they get paid a lot to talk like this but did we really need to sink that low?
Still incapable of expandable storage or removable battery. *_NEXT._*
Good and honest review mate cheers
Still not convinced. Thanks for video
Yo mate, that’s the wrong landscape orientation😂
The reason the GPU performs better is it has one more core than previous. It is just 2 more to be the same as the M1 in 2022 Macbook Air, so makes sense they aren’t far off either. It does have processors to handle raytracing which none of the former Apple GPUs have.
The Samsung performance isn’t similar. The Samsung S23 ultra can barely run Genshin Impact above 45 fps due to thermal throttling while the iPhone (all the way from 13 pro) runs it perfectly.
Resident evil on an iPhone on a cat’s backside? Revolutionary. 😅
I find it incredibly hard to believe that I’ve never seen any of your videos before. Subbed
apple agent
Patiently waiting for that Samsung comparison 😂😂😂😂 my best videos
why it's feelings like good promotion?😅
Wallpaper please
Voice Isolation Already in Samsung  A Series  Phone 📱
Oh yeah. My one plus 10R takes photos in some heic format. How is it connected to heif?
So it can make phone calls as a phone, wow!!!
does anyone remember the Xcover key on the samsung xcovers? i think its similar in that way, except the xcover was such a nice size to hold as well as look at and the button wasn't so far up
0:39 game name ? 🙂
IMHO this review, is hands down, the best one out there.. And came here after MKBHD, that's some feat...
DO A MOON ZOOOOOOOM !!!!
Is this the new iPhone 12 version 4😂
18:30 the pro max did not increase the price They just ditch the 128gb and make the 256gb the base model (cost the same as the 256gb 14 pro max on the U.S)
Excellent👌 Battery drain test please
I feel as though people just like to complain a lot. Sometimes we need the boring upgrades to see what the phones is really capable of. Imagine it lile making a game with a lot of new features but none of them are good, you may need an update that is solely to improve on all lf that in order to see it as best as it can be. To me the iphone 15 is more the peak of that design, it has perfected all of those nich mechanics. Is apples way of saying there is nothing more we can improve on this, and maybe will mean more drastic changes for the future phones because of that.
Nearly 3 minutes and there's nothing of value I've heard about the iP15.
if you have to explain that its better than i think, it probably isnt 😬
80% of the photos I take are accidental screen shots when I press the lock button.
Best iPhone 15 video amongst all YouTubers. U always have a different perspective
all of the software camera features are coming to the 14 pro as well
Arun make a comparison video on the S23 ultra and the 15 pro as I need to upgrade from my 13 and I want to know what should I actually do!
Hardley notheing new
Please mr boss give me the 11pro I have an iPhone 8 and it doesn’t  get ios 17 😭🙏🏻 I live in Nigeria
Bro if you get annoyed while cleaning fingerprint from iPhone 14 pro then give it to me I will happily accept that annoyed thing😅
Yeah nah.... Phones in the last few years seem pointless and very stagnated. It's become a tool to cure boredom 😂
unless samsung bakes all these really greeat camera abilities into their new phone they are in trouble big trouble as these days, for most phone is a content making machine and rarely a phone
Huh? Where can you set power button triple tap?
Hello
The island stuff is the only thing thats cool, but an iphone is just an iphone.
Me still having an Iphone 8 plus lol
Where is a proper file manager app!?
ive had voice isolation for months on 13 pro, its not new
Why is no one talking about the 60hz refresh rate on the base model
Can i have that phone 😭♥️
Its so nice that youre wife is more and more becoming a role in the videos
I haven't used an iPhone in years is there really a back two feature
I just changed my wallpaper. Nothing matters 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Better than you think. Got Payed by Apple for this
your flash is on @ 15:17
Did anybody else notice his flashlight on at 15:30?
Youtube tech nerds are all apple fan boys😂
15:20 when I saw the flash light on I had to go watch when it turned on XD .... but nothing :( anyway that's why I was worried about the new button insted of the switch   P.S. how much does you can game with those heavy games? and what about the heat??
Another paid advertisement
I apparently don’t keep up with features well enough because I just learned that my 14 Pro has a back tap feature. I need to watch more YouTube I guess. 😂
Are we gonna ignore the fact that he took that photo at 23:59 p.m? Cuz I’m not
Where I can find this wallpaper ?
When my phone turns on it just says 'SAMSUNG' in BRIGHT white
Do galaxy watch 6 vs Apple watch series 9 and s23 ultra vs ippro maxhone 15
Im upgrading from an iphone 8. And i have started making content so was thinking of upgrading. I need help in deciding if i should get a iphone 15 pro or a pro max. Appreciate the help 🫶🏻
A17 pro is a game changer … it is a bery underrated chip … GPU is solid…  Snapdragon 8 gen 3 wont come any close to it
No one talks about the shitty apple camera flash setting?
waiting for elden ring with raytracing on iphone🤣
Am i the only one who is still using the iPhone 7🥲? Anyway, bro the content are really good and didnt get bored while watching😂keep up the good work bro💪🏽❤️
The voice isulation modealso works on my iphone se 2, its not a new feature
2:06 nobody holds like that , the buttons are always downward Edit: 2:30 sorry you mentioned it😁
Boring phone more and more
Zero hate, but ... I am sorry you're bought 😢
Not worth the price
It's totally underwhlming and a minor uprade and does nothing to advace smarphone design or development
Please do iphone 15/plus
i used to have an iphone 4 and after that i was an android guy.  but i wanted something with under a 6.4inch display. hence i bought an iphone 14 pro. probably the best phone i have used ever.
Pls do a battery test including the 14 pro vs 15 pro models
I love all your videos but this one i really cant get over it come on its the same phone nothing is worth the change people should use there brain and stop buying every new iphone that comes out
He is so biased towards iPhone. @9:28 he uses motion photo mode in Samsung and normal photo mode in iPhone to show what it looks like iPhone is faster.
I’m just thankful we have a great team at Apple. In a world of hate for each phone maker, I think it’s great we have people who love doing what they do for each of these companies. Life should be enjoyed. And I enjoy upgrading each year. Always that one cool thing to look forward to.
I think we cannot get fluid animations of dynamic island in 60hz refresh rate of iPhone 15 compared to pro models
I'm sticking to my 12
LOL HIS FACE 😭💀💀😭😭 1:51
U r a christopher nolan of phone reviewing.....🎉 keep up the good work mate...
Worst than i imagined Edit: there's nothing better in it to upgrade it from 14 pro max
how much did they pay you to talk this nonsense???
Can we get the link for your wallpaper on your iPhone 15 pro
I didn't watch any review on this phone  Was jst waiting for Aurun to talk about it 😂😂
bro got paid big
Paid content 😂😂😂😂😂
69k likes rn wht the odds
Why am I watching this😂.
Love you bro
they should've given always on display, USB-C, 5G back on iphone 12pro, when i bought iphone 13 pro back in 2021 , promotion + AOD shouda been the case ,with AOD and USB-C could be a complete phone they just put a gimmick with dynamic island 14 pro,  just updated iOS 17 , stand by feature so useful but other than 14, 15pro no one can use it because of lack of AOD despite of having OLED displays,
Ayo chill 😂😂😂
Sir plz give me this phone 😑😑
When someone tried hard to find the advantage of a no change iPhone 😂
Let's wait for S24 ultra
so almost the same as last year but at a new price :) apple is actually scamming at this point the users ....
I BEEN WAITING TY FOR THE VIDEO
Yea!! camera comparison 😊
S23ULTRA vs 15 pro max
Where did you get that wallpaper @mrwhosetheboss ? I love it!!
I’ll stick to my iphone 11 for a year more And upgrade to 12 next year
@ 7:48, LOL
Bro sure is an apple fanboy😂
I'm still pro iPhone 11 Pro Max design. I was hoping they would come back to similar slim design with iPhone 15, but they didn't. They at least decreased the weight though.
Broo...was this a 19 min iphone ad😢
They had to switch to usb c because of the EU
"you can safely INVEST in some usb c accessories." 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lets be honest, Apple will continue to innovate while Samsung just continues to imitate.
You mean downwords ?
Was so excited to see MrWhoseTheBoss and MKBH iphone 15 pro max uninboxing🥰❤️❤️❤️couldnt wait lol since last week
cool, now all they need to do is chop a few hundred dollars off the price, get rid of that ugly notch, add a headphone jack, let me sideload apps, access developer options, use google assistant and keyboard, improve charging speeds, and I'm sold
Arun forgot to Rickroll us 😂😂😂 in this video
7:50 ayo chillllllllll
You just got me at ... MEGA ... PIXEL. Nice one and really good and informative video. Good job!!!
Seems like good time to go from 13 to 14
Apple makes little to no change on the iPhone, tech YouTubers will go down the hole looking for every way to make the phone look cool. but then other brands make theirs and pack it with a lot of features and tech YouTubers are like ... 🙄 Meh..
I just got my iPhone 14 pro yesterday 💀👍🏻 15 is way too expensive
What lotion did you put on though? 😂😂😂
Still cant beat s23 ultra in camera
Usb c to c is confusing If connected to two 15 pro maxes which one is going to give charge to the other  Or between 15promax and another phone supportive of wired discharging
3:48 i have it in iphone 14 prp 😒😒😒
iphone glazing is crazy 💀
mr whos boss selling out this was obviously paid by apple...!! 👎👎👎🤮🤮🤮
I will get popcorn ready to watch the S23 ultra vs 15 pro compression 😍😍😍😍 super excited for that video
Great video! Where can I find that wallpaper though?
cant believe a "tech" youtuber wants people to shill out for the worst upgrade after 14
I’ll wait until the iPhone 16 or 17 comes out. until then I’ll be using my iPhone 12 Pro max still
The volume button don't work to activate the shutter?
Bro im starting to feel like Apple’s paying you 😐
My 80$ 2017 Android too has reverse charging....😂
5:51 ayooo🤨🤨🤨📸📸📸
You should of stopped after 30 seconds , nothing feels practical in this video or interesting
Video streaming at 360p in Bro
One word for Arun’s videos … Bedazzling ! But I still like the stainless steel better specially the gold. Will miss the chrome gold !
Voice isolation is like Voice focus on Samsung phones.
The european Fairphones just look like the iphones, just not that rounded. And you can disassemble and reassemble everything with a single screwdriver.
That cable going to get dirty as hell and u wont be able to do anything Bout that :) Wheres old one was easy to wash and looks like new again :)
I've expected to see a photo/video comparison of iPhone 15 Pro and Pro max. At some point you're switched your topic from iPhone 15 Pro to Pro max 👀😜
isn’t voice isolation already on other iphones? My 11 pro and 14 pro has it
gift me a iphone🥲🥺
The cameras suck compares to s23 ultra
Did you shoot this video on an iphone camera? I noticed some dip in quality over your usual videos…
Without the action button you can just use the volume up button.
7:50 was a really SUS moment
They paid u to lie😂
Recycled cheap material phone price = 1199 😢
DAMN 5 hours ago and 1,000,000 views
You still get a sim eject tool?
I don't know why but it seems like you have been trying to tell us that 1+0=1 but apples gets it done by 2/2+7*2-14=1. Why would I wanna play console games on this die phone when I can enjoy it on a much bigger screen. Like what's the point? I have been using this type c for years, no fast charging in die phone  like others. What m gonna do with this camera when Google pixel can handle any person's pictures like damn good.
this iPhone 15 is very nice   too bad I can't afford it if you can gift me your 14 Pro max I will be so so grateful
I'm sorry but this video kinda resembles an attempt to argue that the burger made of shite, isn't. This phone is an absolute abortion. It uses tech/standards that's almost a decade old in some cases, and charges you a premium for the insult. this is why I left Apple almost 2 decades ago and never looked back.
moon photo ?
Battery test 😤
For those who still have the impression that Android phones from 10 years ago would crash after one year of use, please take a look at the performance comparison. Although Apple still leads the CPU by a large margin, now is the era of GPUs. AI and 3D game image processing also mainly rely on GPU. This year, A17 pro and 8 Gen2 can only tie, but 8Gen 3 will be released at the end of October.  To be honest, we in the Android camp have no mentality of winning or losing. We are just fed up with the mentality of Apple fans who blindly support the Iphone.  Also, for those who say that Vision Pro is the masterpiece of the next era, think about it, would you go out wearing VR?  It's not like mobile phones are necessities and they sell for $3499USD. Iphones sell for $1199USD and you complain that they are expensive. Are you willing to buy a non-necessary product that costs $3500?
I expected more from 15 pro, I will skip this modell  14 pro still great for me.
Your videos are informative and in depth And I love that about your channell
haha, i have to laugh at the camera shutter button as a Sony Xperia user :D Also playing game with a giant hole (dynamic island) just looks golden :D
The titanium build quality is appealing, though already seeing reports of the paint coming off is a bit concerning. In general it's hard to get excited for any modern phone launch. It's become like buying the same phone twice year after year with the plateau on what these chips inside these devices are capable of doing
Its always a good day when mrwhoosetheboss upload❤👍💜🔥
see how mans ignoring the fact that voice isolation was stolen from google pixel
Giveaway the 14 pro🥺
When u said "Mega Pixel", every second of loyalty counted before your friend broke into a laugh
Hehe over here watching on my Infinix😂
The iPhone 15 pro is going to be my first iphone :) i just cant decide between pro and pro max. I cant justify 250€ more for just a bigger display. Because thats the only reason I want a pro max. I want a big display since I watch a lot of Videos and play games on my phone
you can literally build a mini pc for this amount of money and, play all games.
I don’t understand why the phone costs 999$ but 1200€ here in Germany. The Standard 128gb pro. 1000$ is 930€ FUBAR
Housetour
I still personally think (though i've never even tried using a nice phone) that the s23 ultra is better due to the better camera and the fact that you can get apps to solve the overprocessing. and though the iphone can play console games, if that really matters to you you can just get xbox cloud gaming on an android phone.
I can’t lie iPhones quality has really gone crazy good from the past couple of years
Olu olu olu lie lie lie bro got payment from 🍎🍏
It’s weird that apple mentioned voice isolation as a new thing because me and my family have been using it for about a year now on FaceTime😅
Thanks for the video! The studio lighting is too harsh on your face btw
Can't wait for your S23 Ultra vs iphone 15 pro max camera comparison review❤️
Gift me a 15 pro😭😭😭😭😭
Ps4 has hdr, that's not a new thing for ps5
Why you're now reviewing Huawei P60 pro 😮
Main question is……. Worth the upgrade from a 14 Pro Max? 👀
What is location of statue of animals at the table?
"Apple and environment" is really getting out of hand, why titanium, is phone going to space or under extreme ocean depth, its a phone and entertainment device. Titanium production consumes more energy than other available metals. Now like wildfire and madness, every other device manufacturer will run behind this metal for no reason, because apple want its competitors to do that to say others always copy them, Its not bad to do the experiments but do it for some serious equipments like healthcare or space.
I understand that you can record video on ProRes LOG as well as externally on a portable drive. Keen to learn more about it, as the ability to record in LOG and colour grade would be amazing!
I’m not sold from the 14 pro max
It's a HARD PASS for me!
HEIF isnt even unique to apple so lets not consider that a unique property for comparison
you are the only reviewer who has something positive to say about iPhone 15. 60hz in 2024 model, what a garbage.
6 hour gang
I like the wallpaper  Can u share it with me
So is this an unboxing video or what is it???
Live photo?? Google have had that. 😂
I am sick, this video made me feel better. I love you as a person ❤
5x lens is completely unusable, samsung has already done that mistake in S20. But they remove that lens later
My iPhone 13 Pro Max also has voice isolation…
thin bezels are cool, but I don't think they're super practical. I'm going to rock my 14 Pro Max 'til it dies, and my biggest complaint is when the edge of my thumb does things on the screen. I'm annoyed that THAT is a thing and that I am constantly misspelling things when my fingers are actually touching the screen. I have a Pixel 6a for comparison (which has a 'thinner' screen in terms of width, which means that the keyboard space is smaller) and I don't ever have issues typing a text or searching for something on Google.   So yeah, "thinner bezels" may look nice but it actually messes with my productivity and/or utilization. I can't imagine that an iPhone 15 is going to be any better.
How much got you from apple??? For this paid promotion
The best new feature is definetly being able to play AC: MIrage on your phone. A dream. Maybe switching (if I was not broke ofc)
My Nokia 5200 slide had a dedicated camera button which doubled as a shutter button as well
There is no way price can be justified for 15 series no matter how hard we show the phone is good. Showing small things like very big change won't work for apple.
Can you make a similar video with iPhone 15?
The upgrades is so insignificant, Content creators are squeezing juice from a rock.   The explanation of the zoom, etc is glaringly a "stretch" to get a "longer " review. 😅
I was doing homework and i broke my mobile accidently my dad gonna break my hand i need this i phone so it Cant brake easily
Hey Arun you forgot something to put in the video ( the timer of every topic)
If my comments got more than 100 likes @Mrwhosetheboss has to hook me up With an iPhone 15 pro max ....
That voice effect it from Samsung it called focus mode in call
Why does the video look a bit flat ?
Bro i understand then need to say smthing positive but when the first 3 min are about a shortcut button that have been on phones so long and is also in a bad position XD
5:50  I like how you included Ezio's theme from assassin's creed, it's very faint but noticeable nonetheless.
Is it me or do you look very tired?
MKBHD uses the action button for the google assistant.
My android already runs all the nintendo switch games natively with emulation.... add to this all the controllers available and that gaming on iphone is not that great, especially considering apple will be shitty and limited in the implementation
I want that wallpaper someone please provide a link to that
Coming iphone 15 pro max
He is so poor that he can't afford a phone stand and using milo to support his phone.😶😶
Sad to see my favourite tek youtuber whitewashing a below average phone!!
Samsung finna cook these guys
He sure is a apple fan boy
Wtf is a back tap feature and why haven’t I known about this.
MKBHD hasn't made one yet, because he needs to collect more data...
As Flossy Carter says, Congratulations 👏🏼 you just bought the same damn phone twice. 😂  A lot, it not most of the upgrades Apple gave on the 15 pro are software upgrades.
Samsung galaxy s10e have action button its released 2019 😂😂
The difference each year is a 10% overall imo . So buying one every 3 or 4 year is the sweet spot if you can't switch to android.
You don't get a charger 🤣
Heif is optional on Samsung as well
I envy you so much that you still have the physical sim slot,  the world is not ready for esim like in the  US 😪
I can't figure why i would go from Samsung FE to an iPhone 15 or 14 and why people buy iPhone so much. The only reasons i can see are that battery seems to last longer and that their rigid OS provides less choices.
What is it with the reviewers talking about the action button can be mapped as a shutter button to take pics when I’m sitting with my pro 12 and the volume button right next to the mute switch is a shutter button 🤷🏻‍♂️
You need to fix that noisy tap.
I finally unboxed Apple's long-awaited iPhone 15 Pro Max and tested it from every angle. Nothing exceptional at first glance, but what a pleasure to hold it in my hands and finally have a single connector for all my high-tech products. When I put my iPhone 13 Pro next to it, there is indeed a big change. The little details that make the big difference. To see in the long term, I will do a complete review in 1 week and I will giveaway you an iPhone 15 Pro Max 1Tb 😍
Nice! I just ordered the iphone 15 pro black titanium with 256 gb and now i want to take a good case for it. I don't know what to take, UAG or ESR, both military standard
The iPhone 15 is NOT USB 3. ONLY THE PRO MODELS ARE USB 3. How tf do you make such an obvious mistake?
Huawei mate 60 pro+ will beat the brains out of all iphone users even it chip is 5 year older then apples A17 Pro. Huawei is coming for you 💯
By 200$ bro!
i think its funny that this man accidently turned on the flash light at 15:16
It can be as fast as you want...but its a very fast car which cant drive corners....
Tbh, it's not a big deal... but only Apple knows how to sell it... worse thing people believe they're getting something ultra new, when it's not the case at all...
Why doesn't airpods have this voice isolation thing :(
nobody cares about this tiny changes apart from you lot and your careers
I don't why i feel thie is so much like iphone ad.
Very informative video! I learned much more about those new updates in this video.
In my opinion buying A new phone isn’t Important
Can’t believe you missed the charging port that hard lol
I still prefer my 14 Pro Max and a jailbreak will go beyond anything Apple could imagine.  On 16.5 patiently waiting. OTA module entirely debilitated :)
Plastic though 😂
This had a different editor,,, the video felt long
When will the review of iphone 15 will come..in comparison to iphone 14
@16:12 I could feel it coming through the nerdforce😆
Bro where is your hairs
Money also next levle
Finally Arun is impressed 😅 by IPhone 15 📱 😅
It's great that HDR images seem to be better on this phone. Hope the new iOS makes them better on my 14 Pro too. I dislike being unable to turn off HDR for photos. The very least Apple could do to make up for this is to make HDR actually good. As it stands now, HDR overdoes it all and darkens everything to the point that I have to manually adjust the images later on.
voice isolation has been there since ios 15! :)
The s23 ultra is no where near the graphics performance of the new iPhone 15 pro.
Even though I got a notification from MKBHD ., just came running to this Channel. For a fun review ❤
Again the same old , boring design.Few minor updates and all utubers are going crazy again lol
Better heat dissipation 🤨
Is it just me who's tech events actually happen on Arun's YouTube?  Mean apple released the iPhone 15 but till now I wasn't actually invested in knowing so much about it. Mostly coz apple wasn't even going to give me all these details too
I don't think Androids will ever get console games as they have to account for budget phones (you said that in your problem with mobile games video).
im a fan of arun but when it comes to captions of his vids. apple always is the great and positive. while reviewing android there is always something to make you think again if you will like the device. its been years and I noticed, kinda bias
Review right now
have you tried to move that motion photo to a non apple device and see if the size show you same?
This ad was better than apple's event
Most phones use jpeg? I wish
Android user be like: but but samsung is better😢
The new 2.0 cable that comes with the phone. LOL. You have to spend $30 bucks for the 3.0 cable. How much space on the phone do these fancy games take? Clearly, 128GB will not be enough. Perhaps Apple should have started with 256 GB of storage. Another way they get another $100 from you because i would never buy the 128 GB version of this phone with all this tech!  Not to mention, not being able to buy this unlocked without spending another $30! Keep in mind, you can't use your old case, like you could with the 13 and 14, so that's another $50. So your New iphone 15 pro will cost $1200 MIN.
I love the same cameras and software named a new number
This video just shows how apple isheep he is.
In canada the Ipnone 15 Pro, 256gb is $1,806 after tax
We still waiting for giveaway 😅 bro
Hi Arun, I was wondering what stylus I could use for my HP Pavillion dv0603 for school? thank you
You can already take a pic with the volume buttons. Don’t need the action button.
As a physically blind person, the only reason I wanted to purchase the iPhone 15 Pro Max is the bigger screen and bigger size. The bigger size will help me to navigate around the device more easier, and the speaker will be slightly bigger too. So yeah, my purchase is justified. Nough said.
The voice isolation is NOT happening at a hardware level but the reason it persists between apps is because the voice that is provided to the app already has the effects enabled.
voice isolation ? lol that is already on most phones for ages.
Pls Fortnite back to iOS 😢😢
Giveaways 🥺
Giveaways 😢
No thanks I’ll continue using my iPhone 1
Giveaways sir 🤗
i dont know why i would want to play a console game on such a small screen.
Should i buy iphone 14 pro or 15 plus?
YOOOO!!! Waiting for your Wedding Day Video bro!!!!
I only wish that MORE people would use their phone in landscape mode while taking photos instead of portrait - it looks infinitely better...
Voice isolation feature is on previous generations aswell
mkbhd did it better...
S24 Ultra will kill it..... 😎
The changes are so small and pointless it’s not worth upgrading unless someone is forcing you at gunpoint.
The weird dilemma when you see so many YouTubers uploading the video on iPhone 15 at the same time 😂
I'm I only the one who felt like he over reacting that it's something big change lol
Wow he is really good making ad for apple. There isn't really anything new about the phone still he made 2 videos that is 20 min each.
I thought that the performance of snapdragon 8gen2 was impressive but this is more impressive performance than that phone
Haha, completely stole the video title but ok. I'll still to my 13 pro max!
Wait till the pixel 8 comes out.  I got high hopes lmao
While camera is, as always, good heif is not as revolutionary. Other phones such as xiaomi have used heif  format for years now.Also there are phones with raw format capability and  more... But by any means these days there are  plenty of options,and a lot of them are decent. Good review and good phone.
did anyone else realise the prise diffrance is actually $200 not $100
I don't get how everyone loved the midnight color on the M2 Macbook Airs, but now doesn't seem to like what looks to me on the screen as the same color blue for their phone?
Idc if apple made an iphone that look alien I'm always an android guy 😂 no hard feelings to apple tho its just a phone for the rich 😂 just my opinion
Give me your iPhone 14 pro max
do we now have a faster gps than 1Hz? To this day.... 1Hz... after 15 years?
Wish they made a 15 mini Pro 😢
I feel like people are getting satisfied with what should've been the standard all along for most phones. Japanese phones for example has their Camera shot built in the volume buttons on the side, now that iphone has it (albeit in a programable one), people are getting crazy over it... Geez. It's an old feature. I feel at this point, crazy iPhone fans would even go crazier for small changes they add on future iterations of iPhone even if those features existed way back.
Wait it's already out? No way
Its the one i want
Imagine gta 5 running on those phones within 6 months 😮😂😂
i hope the so called games will come before iphone 17 pro max ultra
WHEN DID 15 COME OUT
Don’t convince me to take out a bank loan, my iPhone 12 mini’s wifi and Bluetooth is completely dead soooooooooooooooo……await it’s 2000$ for the cheap one iPhone SE 2 gang wya
7:51 broooooo that got me hard😂
Wow thats so cool! Shame i wont buy it.
As always a great video. Shout to the Genshin Impact players lol
I LOVE YOUR PHONE STAND!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Have been watching all the reviews because I'm on the fence about upgrading from my 14 Pro Max. Thanks for this review, yours the best one yet, providing information other reviews did not include. Absolutely top notch! 🙌🏻
Did your iPhone 15 had the live photo feature on while comparing it's shutter speed to Samsung S23 Ultra? Because Samsung's motion photo feature was definately on.....
Have my 15 pro ordered…… whoop whoop 🙌🏾
Who gives a shit about the camera this much. I don’t wanna pay 1500 just to get a better camera.  Just give me the normal iphone with 120hz without having to break the bank just because the camera increases the price so much….
Giveaway me one of these ....
The 5x lens is likely not providing natural bokeh as the quoted f-stop is with respect to the cropped sensor, i.e., cropped wrt a full-frame camera sensor. One needs to multiply the the quoted f-stop by this crop factor which may push the full-frame equivalent of this 5x lens to well into the teens if not f20. f20 results in a depth-of-field of effectively infinity.
Why does part of the video look like it is super overexposed. Crazy
I love  ❤ when he posts comment if you agree 😊
Phones nowadays are becoming more and more camera Phones... yes camera is well and good why isn't there the same kind the innovation in other aspects!!
Where did you get the wallpaper i need it.
7:47😂💀
Noise cancelling was on iPhone 14pro already.
Halló Hrafnkell  hahahahah
Video information and Background music of your videos always makes me stick to the video
Cat 😍
I really like your videos but the way you're trying to hype every apple feature is putting me off. Like the action button as a camera shutter is so stupid because your hand is always going to get in the way for you to gripe it. You should be at least a bit mad about the removal of silent switch.
I'm pretty sure you're sponsored by iPhone to market it even harder than it should. Even Red Magic 7s Pro is more than worth it at its price point at this point.
Should I order one of these or wait for Pixel 8 Pro?
Even though now a days apple is getting worst and worst. This guy will bring something to make the shit into out of the world smartphone😂
My mom said if I will get The Premier at school I will get the iPhone 15 pro max 256gb version I am excited for it Loll
battery comparison video asappppp, just love it every year!
Action button, damn  Samsung had the remappable bixby button since the s10 And of course, double click the power for camera
can you give me your old iPhone 14 😂😢
Give me one phone
Not convinced.
Thank youuuuuu💛💛
Ad me Jo moto ka phone aaya wahi le leta hu price sunne ke baad
You know it’s going to be a good day when Arun uploads
finally a proper pro looking review from u  been waiting soo long for this come back <3
Where can i find the wallpaper?
What about i phone 15
What colour iPhone 15 pro max is in the video..!!
Please don't forget to include 13 PRO MAX AND 14 PRO MAX when you will do your battery review.  Last year 13 PRO MAX was not on the list .  Thanks.
Just imagine it on the iPad too, I'll ditch the console and the deck for it
Thanks for not being an Apple fanboy and actually reviewing the phone as it should be reviewed, unlike iJustine, who is such an Apple fangirl, she never finds anything wrong with any Apple product!!!
man, I love this community. I love how people can sell the same thing year after year in the name of an upgrade and now reviewers are joining the trend to find some little software tweaks and called them game changers. I mean they can update their old phone software and it will be the same but nha.. they need to sell the same thing again in the name of an upgrade.
Can I please have an Apple Watch
Now we need a comparison between iphone 15 pro max and the S24 ultra ehan it comes out 💯
Costly . Apple 🍎 in the word is apple
you went for pro instead of pro max? Why?
trying ver hard find very very minor differences between new iPhones with older iPhones. Some times I think the are not honest. The didn’t mention anything about the breakthrough of HUAWEI mata 60 which is the big news right now.  What a c..
When it's 🍎 products, you always try to show to people that there's new sensational things even when there's not 😏😂🤣🚶🏾‍♂️
I just think this isn’t your best work , the review feels more like your first impression with not enough topics covered and just running through the video
I've been dying for this video to come out. BTW, please do the camera comparison as well.
Is the phone white or titanium? I bought white and if that's white it looks great
Compare battery life of iphone 14 pro vs iphone 15 pro
It’s just a phone, I’m done with the shady tactics of apple
The "7 lenses in your pocket" marketing is the we have McDonalds at home equivalent of the "1000 songs in your pocket" marketing
To think some people will have bought a new iPhone every year spending up to 15k on a telephone over the last 15 years. Apple are so good at roping people in.
My God how u flip the sides the moment the Cupertino releases devices ! According to many of the hardcore fans they are scolding apple like anything for this release and u ! My God next level of A@$$ Ki@# ing ! 😅😅😅😅
6:47 Smoooth.....
samsung is better yall wasting money on apples bad ecosystem. Apple is like a jail cell. Android is freedom
lens flair still  not fixed
BRO - how has no one told me about the back tap!? Love that feature so much!
Yawn
I updated my iPhone 14 pro and it could basically do the things that 15 pro does but obviously it’s still not really the same
the pros also had a white box last year. :)
Where’d you get that wallpaper?
Soooooo just stick with iPhone 14 because it’s the same
2:00 NO ONE... LITERALLY ONE took photos in that landscape position, every one turns their phone from portrait position to landscape  position on Anti-clockwise direction which is more convenient. if you try clockwise direction half of your hand will block the camera and the navigation gestures will be on your left side. Even in the Apple ad you can see they use in anticlockwise landscape. Sony did this better.
You nailed it at the Mega....Pixel 😅😅😅
"We make minor changes. You give us moolah. Capische?" - Apple
How the hell did he get this phone
I don't understand. If you want to play games on go, for the price of this phone you can get a proper handheld PC AND an Android with the latest chipset. It's nothing new or uniquely useful. You are just buying it because you have a social hunger to fill.
Where to get the background? Can anyone help pls 😅
Voice isolation is so clear because most probably Ray traced core is processing it like Nvidia broadcast on pc. Who knows! But can be.
its sadly a 200 dollar difference not 100
Can we use 3rd party usb c cables to charge these iphones?
Send one for me
watching your videos have made me believe that u r an apple fanboy.,
I’d buy 15 pro just for the photo thing but my 14 pro is still good and I have all accessories for mine so… 😅
The same shit every year. It's like buying a 4 year old phone (for hardware and software) with a really good processor... it's useless
It's a lie, There's nothing new in iphones. Don't be a fool. It's all marketting gimmick
do the comprising better vs a google pixel not with a samsung!
The skintone on the iPhone has improved so much from the 14!!
All information we got about You and iphone 😂
Those voice features been on iPhone 14 pro Max for the last 6 montha
5:10 PS4 has HDR
although it's not the most concerning thing about iPhone , I actually really hoped that they would work on hardware designs.The main focus of Apple is on gadgets and there are so many software improvements since two years ago (not that I'm complaining but it's just way too much and most of the people won't even remember this features or they just wouldn't need them, they can even available them in an upgrade).Of course the quality of CPU and gaming experience is nice on iphone but the charging needs an upgrade which are in my opinion more welcoming by the iPhone users rather that just software improvements.  *it's just my opinions and experience and I'm not that knowledgeable about this stuff and I just shared my point of view hope you wouldn't get angry about this comment
kistoon par mil jayega?
I just hope the battery life is better that’s my main thing.  I know the camera should be better with the pro max but as long as my battery health doesn’t drop to 88% I’ll be happy
"better than I think" it's not really a good standard LMAO
6:32 Yes. Yes it is, do *NOT* f*cking lie to me. Iphones are barely functioning better than the Pixel phones in terms of gameplay reliability. Samsung blows away Apple & every other (non-gaming) phone producers. It's not even close.  The S23U is still faster than the new iPhone 15PM. Just wait till the speed tests come flying out the door.
You don't call HEIF as HEIF, it's called as HEIF!
To be honest the diffraction bw 14 and 15 pro image was not that identifiable 😅
Hey Arun. Since you're upgrading to the iPhone 15, can I please have your previous iPhone 😂 never owned an iPhone before, let alone a flagship 😅
It seems you may have mistaken some iOS updates as 15 Pro features, such as voice isolation that I have been using it for months now on my 14 Pro, which is currently running on version 16.6.1. Apart from that, great videos you’ve got! :)
You Can take Fotos with the Volume buttons
I really want to buy the new iPhone but I'm broke and can't even afford a budget phone
Great Review!! Could you please give us the Link for your wallpaper🙏
Please do a battery test
Say what you want but as an apple user I can say for certainty that the base model 15’s are a glorified version of the 14’s. the issue isn’t the type of metal but the type of back glass they use to make it more durable. Sounds like a cash grab tbh.
Finally another mr whose the boss vid, I know this vid gonna be good 🍿🍿
Being right handed I hold the phone in my left hand. My thumb sits where the button will be. Makes perfect sense to me, I think this mat be the first time I’ve been confused by a point you made. You mentioned it in the last video also.
Voice isolation mode was present before iphone 15. I have iphone 12 pro max and I have it.
I’ve been using iPhones and cameras for photos and even iPhone is portable still think that even new iPhone 15 pro max can’t give you that quality that average camera does.
Finally ur saying good things about iPhones thx bro I don’t like androids
They just can’t get rid of the stressed out over sharpened look. I mean all the technology in the world can’t solve that for a phone
6:26 ''How many will come after this initial honeymoon period?"💀
I finally get it. There are 2 main difference between a Android and a iPhone:  1) You can have better of one thing in a Android, like performance or camera , but a iPhone has it all well rounded. Like you can get performance, camera, style in varing ratios like 100 90 80 or 80 90 100. But in a iPhone, you get everything 90.   2) Android aims to give a varing experience, from phone to phone. But apple gives a singular very polished experience, with everything built for everything.   I hope it helps anyone who is trying to choose ❤❤❤
Voice isolation mode is not isolated to iPhone 15 series. You have this feature in older phones as well.
the "ayo chill" took me out 😂😂
It’s just refreshing that Apple just made a USBC iPhone, without putting their spin on it, or avoiding it with portless, or some kind of loophole to get out of the EU regulations. They just made it happen.
I was watching the video so close to my face I lost track of time. You literally answered all my photo and video questions I had listed. I want to see more of editing on the go with the promax
Apple stole my idea! I thought f a programmable button on a phone befor this iPhone was even announced! I'm gonna sue Apple for Copyright infringement!
They were forced to make the phones USB-C charge if they didn’t have that feature all the 15 phones would be identical as all the 12-14 models 😂
Does the wallpaper come with the phone or is it a custom one?
I am thinking about switching to a 15 Pro or a Pro Max from my 12 Pro Max, I already wanted to switch to 14 Pro Max last year, but that was expensive as hell here in Hungary, surprisingly the 15 series are cheaper than the 14 was. Like literally even now a 15 Pro Max with the same storage capacity is cheaper here than a 14 Pro Max with that capacity as well. This country is really interesting to live in. 😅
Bro please sent me I am very poor to buy iphone
Sheep will still upgrade from the 14 to a 15 AND complain about the usb-c
How much did they pay you?
you will not SCAM me into believing this
Fanboy! 😅
of courseee.... what kind of the review could be made by a apple head ?
Maybe a battery drain test??? I love them soooo much
I would care how better it is, as long as it is aesthetically identical to my 13-P-Max, i don’t want it…
Sry for bothering, but the only thing I am interested in is: where can I get the wallpaper from the thumbnail image? Love the colors.
Settle for 60hz in 2023😂..what a joke
This year, i will not upgrade for my iPhone 14pro max, i can only see marking updates 😂😂,The same design,the same <<Camara setup >> and again no one is going to notice that i have upgraded my device 😅😅😅
The cat was like. " This is the same phone from the last time dude" bring new
Wait how did you get the phone though????
where do we find this wallpaper?
SUCH A PRACTICAL REVIEW. LOVED IT.
5:11 how to download resident evil
Some of the information in these videos needs to be fact checked.  Correct me if I'm wrong but last gen consoles where not incapable of running "advanced" features like hdr, even the launch day ps4 had hdr capabilities and the One X, Pro revisions had full 4k HDR capabilities.  Don't get me wrong the iPhone running last gen games is sick but it isn't doing anything better, in fact it's doing it a lot worse than the refresh consoles of last gen, at a lot lower res and using Metalfx
Wow 😍 I will buy it soon as possible 😁
Whoa. The ambient noise cancelation is crazy
Your production quality it's amazing, that's why I never skip a frame but unfortunately I'm not sold yet. Apple products doesn't seem worth to me. Those "new" features are either pointless or age old from other brands so nothing to be excited for. Apple still got a gap to cover.
Bro am still using iPhone 8+ in 2023 kindly help a brother with those iPhones u not using anymore like the 12pro 🙏🏾😂
Who else noticed the golden chain that Arun is wearing!? Probably it's a gift from his in-laws😁
It's not cropping.  🤦‍♂  You have messed up this bit.  Thankfully MKBHD gets it.
That depth information feature was already on my Huawei P9 Lite 😂😂
Mane the gold PS5 tho 😮😮😮😮😮
Great vid! Just subbed and looking forward to the comparisons video.   Does the digital zoom for both telephoto degrade about the same? Or is the newer 5x less “lossy” when you zoom in digitally?
Good Marketing by you, but it's totally waste. I am happy with Iphone 14Pro max
I've always said this about Iphones I'm an android user mainly because i prefer it but i have used an I phone the whole experience will always trump an android the texting feels so much better navigation just feels so smooth. So I'm not surprised that the Iphone is good.
Actually there is nothing new 👏🏼🤢
I mean... on October 4th we do have an official announcement of Pixel 8's so... can't wait for Arun to have a take on it. Coming by the time when he's been a fan of Google's Pixel after Using Pixel 2 XL ❤
apple is laughing in your face
Baaaaaaaa.
You know there are also left handed people?  For me the action button is actually perfectly placed
7:50 i wipe my phone almost everyday with alcohol, mostly when I go outside etc. I wash my case too, I don't get people that can keep using it with all that dirt and bacteria, endlessly.
Is MFI still a thing or most Type C should work fine?
bro start using derma stamp and minoxidil, your hair line is receding.
I love how mrwhosetheboss said "Foreground Background separation" and then the camera zoomed out and on his shirt "Background" was written.
My 14 pro also has the same voice isolation feature 😒
U kidding me right ! R u a sellout now ?
I can only watch this review and Dream of having one in the future .
I personally am an Android fan, but this year's iPhone is actually really good. Impressive!
S23 ULTRA FUNS HERE???..
Mr who and mbkhd both doing 2 videos on the 15 in the last week... Apple must be desperate for some interest in this model
Yay 10yr old console game quality at slightly lower resolution with some extra fluff on a smartphone.
Woooo another new iPhone model, another camera upgrade, another few percent speed (that you won't notice while texting, checking mails and scrolling TikTok) and even USB C with USB 2.0 speeds if you don't buy the "Pro" model.  In recent years Apple sure does love evolution. Sent from a 6s
I need a review on the s24 ultra when it drops
Samsung can do better
xperia has had that button for years..
Fantastic thumbnail btw, loved it. 👍🏻
Is it just me, or did he FINALLY forget to rick role us 😱!
'' this box '' from 2013 😂 not that impressive honestly (it's only in 720p, 30fps certainly, and PS4 '' like '' quality) Yeah, there's some cool features, like better phone call quality, but it's not *at all* enough to justify buying a pricer phone I think. I have a pixel 7 pro, and if the only difference between the 7 pro and 8 pro was slimmer edges, a 10-20% SoC and  an action button... Yeah, I'm not spending$ 1000 on that.
Adding timestamp would be peachy
0:34  Those are some thin bezels, I didn’t even know phone bezel’s get that thin
U were telling 100 USD more is Apple Pro Max but it is 200 USD
Maybe its high time we started getting our focus more on the "little things" than the "ground breaking things". Smartphones manufacturers are reaching their peaks in terms of hardware innovations.
Action button = samsung Bixby button 🗿
I got a add for the 15 pro before this video 💀
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaa... No not spending that much money
Sounds like a iPhone 14 Pro maxS.  Refined iPhone..
stay still jesus christ
One of the best tech reviews I've seen recently. I should click into your channel more often!
14:50 this looks so fake
Milo the perfect phone stand? Need a top Milo features 😂
Arun made a calculation error here for the difference in cost for the pro and pro max😁 18:28
my s21 ultra doing hiec photos... so it must be sth new on the market 😂, we have a lot of computing power... but so what? DEX in Samsung makes us have a real computer in our pocket. ads about a new iPhone had a 7x focal lens, I don't even want to move. The funniest part was when you try use new button as a shoter button for camera 😂 yeah definitely is in convenient place for that😅
Drop the wallpaper 👀
Be here deceiving yourselves
The iPhone lover boy Page lol
I kinda wanna make the jump from s22 ultra to iPhone 15 but now that you need to get the max to get the best camera I will wait. I was hoping Apple would be the company that kept a top spec phone in just a smaller package but they did away with that 😢
So 15 pro max should be better battery then 14 pro max?
I think we are contorting ourselves too much nowadays to justify an Apple phone purchase. This is just getting embarrassing.
Oh glad I’m not the only one who uses their cat that way (as a stand)
They paid you to give a good review
WHERES THE REST OF THE CHARGER???
And some genius rocket guy tweeted, I don't see much difference. Maybe the camera is 10% better?
6:47 bro is casually tossing $2400  My anxiety : 📈
Please compare the camera of iPhone and Samsung and  Xiaomi and Huawei ....  We need to watch this please Arun brother make this video
why did they add a sim ejector if the phone has no sim tray
He is explaining i thought He is CEO of the Apple shame on you
samsung having basically the same design as the previous gen was negative critique many had but iphone doesnt get talked about that much which is weird lol. I could probably fake my iphone 14 pro max as a 15 pro max
voice isolation has been in older iphones too, the improvement you see is cause of ios 17
You are an apple fan boy ofc you would put this title
The new usb cable is basically 2.0 usb.
18:50 pro Max is now a $200 difference from pro ($1000 vs $1200)
Literally an iPhone fanboy review... disappointed
RIP for the waste water
Strange how when the note 20 ultra came out with a 5X zoom lens everyone said its too much for portraits and not good and that they should do like apple and put a 3X lens .. when they did and now apple did a 5X lens its like and upgraded things and its the new standard now and u find excuses for them to make it seem good ... good dam fanbois
Bro is overhyping every iPhone every year
I think you should research a little more before talking about gaming. PS4 has HDR support for games since 2017. This is not a PS5 gen exclusive thing.
Watching Mr. Who’s the boss’s video is like watching a movie 🍿
15 pro or pro max?
Don't forget me if you do an iphone giveaway
If you like iphone 11 we can exchange 😂
crowdfund me 💀💀
This is why I miss the live events back then. They used to demo all the features as we learn how to use them.
So its a copy of sony mark 1 V features
Iphone charger is just ipad charger
It's the same phone.
Arun bruh you make a lot of mistakes when you talk about computers and game consoles. Please do some research or just don't talk about stuff you don't understand and have no knowledge of rather than spouting nonsense. The A17pro isn't capable of running the same game as on the console. It's really just a mobike version unlike what you claimed.
Always entertaining
It is unbelievable how much work your team puts into these videos. This video was expectedly so good and very informative. Thanks, Arun.
IPhone is not the only phone in the market say something about Huawei mate 60 I'm going to unfollow you until then
Better than you think 😂 it's been a year and it's cost more than ever so it's have to😂
I still don't get the fact that people choose to send voice notes back and forth to each other instead of messages?!  I'm officially becoming part of the 'older generation' now 😬
Agar future mai mera baccha iphone 15 pe game khela… khaal utarni padegi uski
Ayo chill 💀
Not a single YouTuber criticized how lame of an upgrade this iPhone is. As an iPhone user and Apple ecosystem prisoner, I’m f’in disgusted with the state of “reviewers” nowadays. Ffs
ARUN IS THE WORST BIASED iSHEEP EVER LIVED. HE HAS ENABLED LIVE PHOTO FEATURE ON S23 ULTRA WHICH SLOWS DOWN THE SHUTTER 9:28
ARUN IS THE WORST BIASED iSHEEP EVER LIVED. HE HAS ENABLED LIVE PHOTO FEATURE ON S23 ULTRA WHICH SLOWS DOWN THE SHUTTER 9:28
I have the 14pro and the 3x camera used for portrait shot SUCKS. Not sure if the 5x one will be better
The last part of the video was awesome! Mega! Pixel!😂😂😂
Still ain't getting one
Mega pixel
Congrats to Apple for solving problems they created themselves
ARUN IS THE WORST BIASED iSHEEP EVER LIVED. HE HAS ENABLED LIVE PHOTO FEATURE ON S23 ULTRA WHICH SLOWS DOWN THE SHUTTER 9:28
camera comparison with s23ultra please..... need it for purchase decision... love
I wonder if people at the Apple office watch your reviews
00:26 I'm so sorry but don't You think that they could implement that in simple update? U are defo sponsored by Aple big time. Sad to see. Aple introduced usb_C like they just discovered it. No thank u
To answer the question of how easy it is to port such a console game to an iPhone: NOT Easy. It would actually be easier to port to Android in most cases. I don‘t think this will catch on, but stunning mobile games will for sure come up
Another episode of product I can't afford but still watching 😢
I always thought you are truly biased regardless of the brand, however seems the apple effect is stronger. There is literally nothing new about this Phone, apple have had this trend forever (of not bringing anything new in new phones), it's not something new, you still tried to show off their device as having many new features. We have lost another biased gentleman to apple absurdity.
Bad gloves
features or rectification of disadwantages ?
You are trying really hard to make it sound good
While other reviewers saying its the same as IPhone 14  you see the differences with an amazing review.
This seemed more like an add for the iPhone. Why you should buy the new iPhone.
How much space do the aaa games take up on the phone
nothing interesting Samsung s23 you would have them before
Steve Jobs would've been disappointed
You're No/1
Hey Arun. Just to let you know, the voice call options are an iOS 17 feature rather than an iPhone 15 Pro one. I have it working fine on my 11 right now. I’ve preordered the 15 Pro, though. Love your videos bro.
i like your videos but you are a bit biased..
wallpaper? 😮
I'm not an iPhone fan, but WOW this phone is a huge improvement over the last one.
They always add just enough… to sell enuf… for US SHAREHOLDERS.  blah blah blah with not having certain hardware on a Galaxy or Pixel…  We all know Apple could do it, but not at the volume and pricing to keep their margins.
17:21 yeah
Another device I now know all about but won't buy 😂
is there a difference between voice isolation on the 15 Pro vs 14 Pro? It already works pretty well IMO on the 14 series.
I'm pretty sure voice isolation was available before iPhone 15
Voice isolation is working fine with me on my iphone 14
Sony Xperia z1 have a button for camera.
Bro what is ur obsession with iPhone vs Samsung It’s enough now  every phone is good and its good to have a phone which have everything
Does anyone as a link to the gorgeous wallpaper?
I think I saw Mrwhosetheboss air pods😊
What’s that wallpaper ?
how much Apple gave you to promote it
Too much information, my brain stopped functioning at 12:10
11:12 the last image on the cameraroll kills me 👀👀
Thanks for this in depth video i really love it thanks 🙏🏽 ❤🎉
Honestly you look really unhappy making this video. You are not happy with this phone
Voice isolation is available since ios15 I believe and not just for the pro phones, so why was it talked about it in this video as if it was an iPhone 15 thing.
Voice isolation and wide spectrum have been features since iOS 15 came out lol
Babe Mrwhosetheboss just posted a new video!
Can't wait for the comparison video 🎉😂
Android be like:  Slide right to open camera goes brrrr
Worst fiancé i have ever seen 😂😢 don’t marry her god bless you
The fact is, iPhone believes in quality at the same time Samsung in numbers...
I feel bad for tech reviewers, they have to now makeup pros for same age old iphones to be sold as new. Just for once, hold apple accountable
I think it's useless for people who already have the 14 pro's , like litreally there is nothing new no matter how you stretch . I am pretty sure if samsung released a phone with just these type of upgrades you would have just straight up bashed them pretty hard .
From your review I am sensing that 😂 iPhone 15 series cameras also a trash like iPhone 14 series..RIP iPhone
Thank you for addressing the gap in zoom on the pro max - that has been the 1 thing on my mind!
How did you manage to say the word router wrong lol
If I’m able to play Diablo or COD I’ll be an iPhone for lifer
Basically same shit like the previous version. Except type-c. They should find a way to extend battery life. That will be better than i think Arun.
Ios 17 battery consumption is massive. Don’t update your older iPhones and ipads. Trust me
Ready for the dinner time real review. Dhanyawad Bhai. Ganpati bappa morya 🙏🏻
The main thing I’m upgrading for is the sleeker lighter pro. Holding this stupid 13 pro is annoying with one hand it’s so bulky and heavy
All of these features on android already
Apple dRider
Arun, blink twice if tim cook forced you to put this video up
For the first time in a long while,  mrwhoistheboss got the maths comparison wrong TWICE!😅 Guy said 100 dollars more instead of 200 dollars more!
Bro the portrait mode feature is already present in the pixel devices
Apple : thanks!  for letting us know that...about our phones features we didn't know.
Source for your claim that it uses the same textures as the PlayStation version? I bet you just made it up
I’m going to be completely honest. I’ve so far liked all MrWhoseTheBoss videos but this one is a miss.   1st thing is that this is a supper hot topic, it had to have a video. But I don’t know if it’s Arun style to be positive but this were merely tweaks to a phone and this video could be more critical to expose how little it has changed . He had to look so deep to find little things it’s cool how he can make them relevant  2nd the design it’s a opinion battle but it baffles me how this feels like Pokémon games. Give them the same recipe with a few new ingredients, makes people not want something really revolutionary or exciting. I don’t know if it’s me or not, but everything just keeps repeating and we go with it. If you have a case on your iPhone I’m sure o won’t know by 1st look which one is it. 3rd I hope Apple users are happy to have to pay for another cable for higher speed, but let’s look at the cable untangling   I imagine how sales would fail with a different model by looking at the  pre order percentage compared to iPhone 14. I feel so misfit
We want the battery test asap
The High efficiency Pictures (HEIF) & even High efficiency Videos (HEVC) are both available in Samsung years ago (available in camera setting).  "Motion photo" is also available in normal photo mode that only available in day light, in low light motion photo can't be used that was also introduce before than iphone.  Talking about changing the focuse after clicking a photo is also available in Samsung (use portrait mode and after the Picture is clicked open it and u will see the "change background effect" option in that u can change more than it's intensity focuse, colour point, spin, etc.)  The motion photo and change in background effect is only available with Android 12 (one ui 4) and above
I am happy with my PC for hardcore gaming❤
Could you please tell your team to stop using intense bgm... That's little annoying.
Any Xiaomi video coming soon ?
ഒടുക്കത്തെ വെളുപ്പിക്കൽ ആണല്ലോ
An honest camera comparison between s23 ultra and 15 pro max!
60hz is a joke. We have 2023.
i’ve been saying that it’s kinda unfair for people to say the phones are barely changing so don’t upgrade, and they are still on the 11… they’re just jumping on bandwagons these people have not even given the newer phones a chance
S23 Ultra 👀
Seems more of like iOS 17 video instead of iphone 15. Mostly things can be sent to other iphones using software (not hardware).
I can only imagine how much money Apple has thrown at you
Where can I get that phone holder 🐈
Well, the iPhone 15 seems great and all, but I'll have to lose a kidney to get it, and for me that's a real problem, because I just don't have 1.2K laying around which I can use to get a Phone, so I guess imma stick to my Redmi for a bit longer
16:30 Totally agree with iOS 17 beta point. It degraded my 7 mo iPhone 14 Pro’s battery health from 99% to 94% in just 2 months.
Best mobile reviewer I have ever seen 👌🏻
Preordered 2. One for myself and one for my Non apple girlfriend 😂
Voice isolation is there on previous gen iphones as well sir. 4:43
Titanium is softer than steel and scratches much much much easier
I don't rate iPhone, so I will jog on
I wonder if the A17 Pro chip is going to be on the Iphone 16.
Yeah the thing is more refined and better offcourse but does it really stand out compared to the last generation? iPhone 14 pro max was great 15 pro is a tech not required
Me who cant buy this but still watch it anyway 😅
iPhone 15, who even cares.
Back tap which every iPhone has; meanwhile me with my iPhone 7🌚
Dope video as always! One thing though, samsungs flagship geekbench scores are basically half that of the new iPhone so i wouldnt say their performance is similar at all lol
Voice isloation was there since ios 15
The background sound of a car and a speaker from 8:20 is such good attention to detail! Love it!
My 5yr old phone defaults 49MP photos and it takes them in less than a second
Wait. Sooo USB-C in iphone pros allows for faster data transfer but the default cable will downgrade the speeds anyway?
black box didn't come with the 14 pro either.
But voice isolation did exist before, right?
Using the action button as the camera button really reminds me of Sony phones. However, Sony phones still have 3.5mm headphone jacks
You dont answer in my onky question can you connect direct ssd ...for example t7 samsung?????😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The time of big changes is over, every year i'm like 'meh", here, the only good thing is usb C, and i have it on my android for years, sad.
so what is new about iphone world!
I just got the 15pro max lol upgraded from 12 pro
All the way from Guyana 🇬🇾...luv your vids😊🎉❤
4:27 I busted out laughing 😂
Will wait to watch for battery and nightography comparison from my S23 ultra 😂❤
Ayo chill 🗿😭
😢😢
I'm sure Apple would be smiling after seeing this video 😁
1. Thread is not only for apple smart-home devices 2. It's not that great that many iOS 17 features are mentioned here without information that they'll work on older phones too. And the voice isolation isn't even an iOS 17 feature, it was already there on iOS 16.
We should all praise this. AAA games arriving on smartphones, it is not only about games. If you take it back in close past games themselves were the software that pushed hardware companys to deliver better devices. All in all even snapdragon and mediatek have gpu-s already capable for this couse they were already 20% faster than gpu in a16. What impressed me the most was imortalis g715 from mediatek totaly demolishing snap gen 2 and a16 in raytracing it was almost twice as fast. Impressive to have that kind of competition.
Hasn’t the voice isolation mode existed for quite a while? Think it’s an iOS update rather than related to iPhone 15
The only thing u Found really strange with the new iPhones, the normal iPhone 15 has 100% recycled aluminium and the moment that happend they introduced titanium that is probably not recyceld…
The fact that Arun switched to the 15 PM on the stand tells so much about the honesty of the review and the upcoming compares agenst other brands , We all know h's a apple boy but Man! you should just test it first , This wouldn't be subjective to show the real facts to us more than it was just a free marketing to apple 😉
That's my point, if gpu is 20% and cpu is 10% better and now it's running village so why can't it run on 14 pro with lower level of details, shadows and anti aliasing?? (Like, gtx 1060 with 4gb can run it but also, rtx 3080 with 8 gb with 60% performance difference)
The best phone ever...perfect for  "smart" people... This video trigger the unsubscribe option...
The 11 Pro Max is the most comfortable iPhone in my opinion.  That form factor was right on.
MEGA PIXEL 🤣🤣🤣
I love your videos 😅 give me your old phone 😂
12:39 I need that bloons tshirt
well the zoom in the beard was a perfect example XD
I love apple 💕
How much did they pay u to make this video? XD (btw iPhone is best but still 15 is literally same of 14 and 13, just chipset)
Voice isolation is a feature now? Lol
So basically the same camera from the iPhone 14 Pro Max, they just added 5X zoom?
Coming to camera  Galaxy << iphone << Pixel
Arun is the worst tech reviewer in the entire youtube who makes this platform so unreliable. He's so biased towards apple because he's getting paid by time cook. Mrwhosetheboss is such shameless channel 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Voice isolation is there is in ios 16 not a new feature 😂
If this comment gets 10k likes Arun has to buy me a new 15 pro max. (like that will ever happen)
Can't wait to get the 3rd degree burns from mobile gaming 🤣
Samsung winning, ipuone slowly turning into a Samsung lol
what do they spend all their R&D money on? none of these features are new or even improved in the market. hopefully it's going towards the vision pro...
How he changed to an apple sheep lol
Sigh my opinion but it just pains me now to see all these suck ups to the iPhone......I k own mine is not that great (xr) but b serious bro every time u review the iPhone I just see bias written on you for head...am un subscribing
I see the new console quality gaming more practical on the iPads when they get the upgrade
0:50 The 14 series too did have the white box.
nice promottional video, not even once, did you mention that this $1000 phone has only 60hz display and rest of features are being used by most of the world since more than 8 years... how much did apple pay you?
I think 🍎 had a plan for this iphone since past 3 iphones 12,13 and 14 had no major change this iPhone on getting significant amount of changes make it look bigger deal than it actually is.   I mean to say that all these features we were supposed to get earlier and now Iphone 15 is like combination of all the new features which we didn't get in 12,13 and 14
Synopsis : Youtuber tries to justify buying another new iphone which isnt new at all
but doesn’t voice Isolation exist in previous Iphone as well? I use 14 pro max and it exist 🤷🏼
How come you already have the phone and me have to wait to friday to get it?
We also need JRPGs like person for iPhone NOW!!!! 😊
I always felt like he is biased towards Apple over Samsung.
Cool fiancé man.
I'm a big android fan and have for many years defending, blah blah. I feel I would like to move over to apple. What's people opinions these day's.
Same old shit, just a different name 😂. Influencer marketing at its finest. 🎉
2:03 literally no one holds the phone like that on landscape  Arun: yes
Samsung also has HEIF For year's in settings.
all of you do realize what they did with the battery, had to upgrade to usbc and how the phones keeps getting slower with every update.  Apple is an evil company
But the battery life on 15 pros are way worse than 14 pros, what a let down
I love the detail you went into. Of all the videos I’ve seen today about the 15P/PM this is the one that truly got me excited to get my new phone.   Also … fiancé? Looks like you’re doing well these days. Congratulations!
Here comes the paid Apple sheep 🙉
I'd like to see it on android so I can play console games on my rog phone which I think is superior overall in gaming, including the speaker performance compared to a Samsung or iPhone, the only 2 things those 2 have in my opinion is a camera, they lose for just about almost everything else
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra will remain King till S24 Ultra😂
Could you talk about Tecno😅❤
Your videos are getting too biased towards apple products 😢
I've had Android from day one. My girlfriend may have convinced me to switch to Apple for once. Apple moving to USB-C is the main reason I'm willing to give it a try. It's a toss up between 15 pro max and the Fold 5... hmmm
Why are you not talking about Tecno🤔
This encourages developers to consider developing games for m series cpus and may be part of a bigger gaming strategy.
2000 euro phone get's a slow usb cable. This is what life in the tech world has come to 2023...
Great explained video.  Needed that!
We all want a battery test video now :)
Well isn't the voice isolation kinda like voice focus on samsung?
Why is voice isolation is being talked about as a new feature. It’s already there in my iPhone 14 Pro
Bro the isolation feature is already there in 14 pro😂
Whosetheboss is the boss. Excellent video and it has made me REALLY consider getting the iPhone 15 pro max though I’m short on cash 😂
Capturing the portrait mode in normal mode is a nice add on. Samsung in a way also captures the depth information in the normal shots.. Samsung Suggestions in Galary suggests you to Add portrait effect to the shots taken in normal mode. Hope Samsung implements and integrates it fully in the next Galaxy.
How do you play resident evil on the iPhone again?
Getting the 15 pro
Hey Arun, can I get the iPhone 15 pro max? I am willing to trade in my iPad🤣
Please give a iphone  Love from Bangladesh 🥺🥺
Apple should give you a portion of their company based on the way you market it already lol ❤
Arun could u send me your iphone 14 pro
That Tap Water wasting gave me little bit anxiety . Just use music speakers next time 😂😂😂
We need to talk about that bedazzled ps5. 😂
48mp in night mode?
Our guy is in deep love 😂
Isn't the gap 200 dollars? 1199-999=200
Still prefer my Samsung ultras but I'll admit Apple stepped up a bit, that being said they still limit and do things to their customers I can't get behind but they are pretty nice phones
Meanwhile steve jobs from hell :  wtfffffff apple,you are now act like Nokia Gen
Longest Ad I ever seen..
its actually WORSE than you think XD DONT LET APPLE FOOL YOU GUYS!!
It's still disgusting that they gimped the regular models with USB 2 C ports when it likely would have been less expensive at every level just to pick USB 3 ports because of economy of scale. They're shooting themselves in the foot with that move. It's super weird. Just join a *modern standard of data transfer/charging speed.*
does iphone 15 have crash di
i'm pretty curious about the lightning cable, is apple going to discontinue the lightning cable for the c-type cable or they're gonna continue both?
Where can I find your amazing wallpaper?
There's a lot of harsh lighting on your forehead 😅
Maybe iphone 17 pro will be in the range of s23 ultra 🙏
11:40 FOR THE LEFT HANDED PEOPLE!!!
Nice fingernails Arun:)
Broo it was so qute when you were talking with your fiancé and your cheeks turned purple from smiling 😅 subtle but so cute hope you guys have a beautiful life together
How are the speakers when comparing to the 14 pros?
Finally a button designed for left handed people… 😂
Even review the new i phone is boring,, if you watch the review of i phone 14 it literally the same ,, just the name changed
The iPhone 15 came out on my b-day😊🎉❤
The last true change Apple made was making the Minis ! Bring back the mini and make it Pro ! Phones don’t need to be as big as they are. They don’t fit in our pockets
The thumbnail is misleading!
No. No its not
Arun givee me the wallpaper linkk 👀
This video is like Mirage 😅
Time for a haircut boss...
Was very excited for this video!
yeah not its and iphone nothing new just same outdated boring stuff people buying it cause they think gives them status
Can i have that wallpaper?
Can it just be agreed that the iPhone 15 is nothing to get excited about and is likely not worth the upgrade unless you are on an iPhone 12 older? The real issue with USBc charging is that unless the whole house is using it, there will still be a mixing of different cables etc., easier for families to just stay at 14 or older for now.
This was the last straw. They remove more and more from the packaging, charge more and more every year and never change anything noticeable. Im finally gonna do it. Im switching to Android. Ive been thinking about doing it for a while now but this has pushed me over the edge
Is this a biased review?
Apple being apple, you get an Iphone 15 pro, but... you get a USB2.0 cable for slow charging and transfers... So you need to buy another cable for quicker charging or quick transfers on +1000euro phone... classic useless e-waste... because once you get a new USB cable, you will never use it again, unless as a spare? Just again, DUMB
ගැම්මක්❤🍎
I’ve been using the Voice Isolation feature since mid 2022, what are you on about it being a new one?
This is a paid review hands down Apple has really bought these large techies this time
Brother I miss U are video 😊
Voice cancelation for calls/facetime was already on IOS16 and my iPhone 14 Pro
Apple: ". . . but but my RTX"
Samsung has double press power for camera for years, its the way i always access cam quickly
Apple be like - before Launch of new product give an Secret Update to Older version
Im sorry but I preffer the mute switch , one of those things which made Iphone…Iphone!  Im ok with everything else they did.
Samsung S24 is on the way
One to two s23 ultra videos vs 50 iPhone videos
Man loves his job ....just loving his content 😍
But 3x cinematic was the best distance optical zoom not digital so iphone 15 pro do not have optical zoom 3x? Optical zoom only 5x?  On cideo same problem?
I got a feeling like its a biased review, from Arun.
ProMax cost 1469 here in Spain lol
Wallpaper?
So is portrait mode redundant now?
Voice isolation was here before the iPhone 15 was released
The editor was like, "Ayo Chill ", when he was cleaning the finger prints off the phone🤣🤣🤣🤣
Since I am not sponsored by Apple I can easily say, iPhone 15 Pro got 3% better since iPhone 12 Pro so it's time to upgrade;) And iPhone 15 is like Back to the Future past, since it is using USB 2.0 from year 2000 in 2023 and 60hz for $800. What an mind boggling innovation.
How much did you get paid? The iphone 15 is just bad computer to samsung now.
now im excited for my iphone 15 pro max
Soo iphone 14 pro max or iphone 15 pro max?
i'm ready for 240hz display
S23 ultra ❤❤❤
hi can you donate something that you don’t need to me?
Can y put a link with the wallpaper plsss
Remember the Bixby button on Samsungs that everyone was complaining about including Arun, it was programmable too, just like this action button.
All a money grab, only significant positive change is USB-C and they managed to nerf that 😂
Arun is never gonna give up the rickrowl😂😂😂
Console games will destroy the battery and it's even worse on apple phones because you won't be able to change it without paying a price of another phone.
Iphone 15 is so uninteresting  that it took to mention every feature in some awesome way like we never heard before to make it interesting 😂😂😂
Ayo chill😂😂
Everyone complains about the flat sides and sharp angles, but with a case, those complaints go away instantly. I know some people enjoy the naked feel, but I like being able to prop my phone, and the rounded edges make that impossible. Just a thought
Can't wait for the battery test
iPhone 24MP? I think you meant 48MP
actually in samsung's S and M series (i think so i havent tested in every model) you can change normal photos to portrait aswell i dont know why no one talks about it that much.(its been there for atleast 1 year)
Swaer down ppl who can't afford it they just watch videos innit
Apple is 🔥
صاير مطبل كبير
Samsung comes with 400mp+ 10k video recording system soon
I could understand what he is saying English very bad .
Dammit! I've been trying to resist the urge to upgrade from my 14 Pro Max & you are not helping! 😂
for the action button i could set up a shortcut to my phillips hue light
There are professional photographers out there caning the misinformation on the cameras. 🤔
My Honor magic 5 pro takes better pics than iPhone 14 pro. All my friends and relatives are surprised with Honor camera. Really the display and camera are very good.
Was the the capture speed comparison part just a place holder video? because the galaxy has Motion photo mode turned on, and that slows down the capture speed significantly
The time Apple or another company changes battery technology, like instead of Li-On to Li-Po4, that would be a real revolution. Before that, these are just small features not worth paying attention to.
❤apple❤
How much did apple pay you
Actually I am not feeling any hype about this Phone. Seems to be a place holder for next gen. Anyone feels the same?
Give me  one🥲
I thought last gen was 48mp
2:44 wow so apple wants me to spend $2000 for a new camera button..? Ill keep my old phone thanks
I always love the details you share about the products you cover. As a professional speaker I really appreciate your incredible timing and transitions as you work through the product presentation. Thank you for sharing. 😊
You will not be a legend in the future , you already become a legend bcz of your breathtaking hardwork . Lots of lv..
Called it 15 pro max is gonna be the best phone, very skeptical about turning in my 14 pro max, will wait a year
New update in Iphone - carbon neutral, carbon neutral and new carbon neutral. And USB type C too
Voice isolation is an existing feature actually from ios 16 i guess
These people are such actors. In fact they look like paid actors that present you some "seemingly" downpoints while convincing you that it is still to buy these phones...  His movements, background music, energy around the video... everything feels like a pre staged video with cinematic manipulation to get consumerists, Young and naive people to get utterly exites...  It is actually very hard to find straight to the point and realistic videos.  Do not take this as hate. Its just my honest opinion on modern technology review youtubers.  You seem so nice and cute and adorable... but constantly manipulating with small details through the video. It is noticeable that you seriously dedicate yourself to this...  Well, cant Blame you...
4:16 Uber Eats 15 mins away? Hungry while filming? lol
10:34 THE DATE IS APRIL 2022 💀
Power delivery from one phone to another is older than reverse wireless charge. Lol
😢😢😢 Ek I Phone Hume gift kr dijiya Sir 🤕
with the new type c port. that's really an innovation. remarkable achievement there apple.
Ppsspp 👀 Android dudes 👀
I've got a big problem. love watching things am clearly not going to be able to afford 😂😢
I always play games in my backyard on my phone that leans against my cat.
Gift me one sir so I can get experience it😂
Ive been waiting for this new iphone ever since i bought S22 Ultra, worst decision ive made. Samsung used to be good, but right now marketing doesnt back up the actual performance. Cant wait to get mine iphone 15 pro max 🤩
Does voice isolation work with non-apple earbuds too?
its a 199 or 200 Dollar GAP not 100 dollars !!!!
It's always better than I think       I.e better shit than i thought, no innovation, no new design , no excitement beside the fact apple new smartphone
😕 meh
.
@Mrwhosetheboss sorry but the Triple a  games makes no sense, if they are supported on Mac Apple silicone why are they coming to the Iphone and not to the ipad pro m1 or m2? Why don’t they make it available for the Iphone 13 pro and 14 pro they are not that different from the new iphone
Why is there a lightning cable at 1:11?
love Bangladesh ❤
even samsung phones can take pictures in heic format.(I am using a f23 5g which is a midrange for inr 15k (around $200) hoping to see more phones with heic support. its actually tooo good a 12mp pic takes no more than 1mb and comparing to jpeg which takes around 6-10mb for the same resolution heic is good.
Man the only important things is that gaming some consoles games , and type c port so it's must be at same or near prices
Absolute waste of money
So is it still an overpriced for these ip15's spec?
Good video but it's a little dark and lacks a little colour compared to your other videos.
That action, button old feature of android. That suck
Remember me when video gets 10m views
Edititors if you're reading this please don't put those transitions 😢
I wish that comparison about bezel is more longer and side by side, zoom and straight view from top. 😔
Can you give me your old iPhone 😅😅
Galaxy s23 ultra exposes backgrounds extremely well! There is no over exposure!
This is why I'm sub to your channel because mkbhd speaks like he's being paid by Apple
You are the best arun I love all your videos thanks
Saw the title and I was like, "his always praising Apple products
Somehow the comment section feels like a deluge of bots promoting the new iphone...
Another way of thinking about using that action button for the camera is that it's optimized for lefties which is an odd choice, but a welcome one for a leftie like me. XD
This are all old technology and have been around for years. Honestly I don't really know what's new to expect.
Despise iPhone Bored and Best Champ Samsung s24 or S25 soon coming release next year 2024 can't wait!
Maan, you're a Apple simp
this video should've been a camera only review. great video
Can i get a free ps5
paid promotion !!!!
Nah Arun, it seems like you're creating problems for their "solution". 2023 gadgets should be much much smarter IMO, and the new iphones are just not it.
camera battle with s23 ultra
In almost all videos you emphasize mainly on Camera quality .  Plus you are a content creator . Not everyone is ( most people arent ). Hence pro cameras are irrelevant for most people . There is more to a smartphone than a camera.  Display size  Screen qulality and resolution Speaker quality  Interface /software / UI weight etc..  Your reviews are too bisaed based on camera quality . not everyone buys a phone mainly based on camera
Great video. For someone with 2 kids and takes a lot of pics/videos will the 256 suffice or should you upgrade to bigger storage?
damn just sad there’s no red edition this year 😢
it's not, don't even try
But you can already use your volume button to take pictures when the camera mode is on?
Welcome to can't afford but still seeing a content with smiley face
Clearly a paid review
I loove watching your videoss you should make a video about the nintendo switch 2
You started the video saying there was no big standout feature... USB C is the biggest improvement the iPhone has made in years in my, and im sure many other peoples, opinion.
Welcome to 2018- Uh? it's 2023?... Apple is late as usual... 15 series is mid I'm sorry Arun, you can use the most elaborated words you want... but this is a flop...
Though its cool to have the option, console level games on mobile just dont feel the same. I played Village on stadia and didnt get any lag but mobile just doesnt give you the same feel that you get on console.
Worse battery life, worse thermal performance, that’s what you so called “better than you think”? That A17pro chipset on the 15pro and pro max is like cooking the phone itself. 👎👎
POV: When Arun flipped the phone My heart: 💀💀💀
The "AYO CHILL" car got me😂😂
Samsung bomb yet to drop💯🔥
we need s23 ultra comparison with 15 pro max immediatly
My iPhone XR has isolation sound mode... I use it when walking home from work on FT with my GF to get rid of traffic sounds...  so I don't think that's a new thing?
Apple lovers will anyhow defend their daddy 😅
Wow. It's better than... any other phone prior to 2010 and too expensive for what it can do. Edit: I lost count after 150 models on more than 10 brands in team Android better spec to spec than this phone.
3:14 that was old feature buddy! It came with IOS 16 software update, i have it from almost a year now on my 13 pro max😅
Camera Comparison is cool but im most hyped about the battery test and i hope that comes even earlier.
Everyone: I love how this guy rick rolls us everytime!  Meanwhile editor: I'll just find door..🚪🏃
Many people can’t afford this new iPhone, myself included.
15:24 please turn off your flash
I’m getting ready to study long and hard tonight. I’m gonna use this video as a reward at the end, I can’t wait!!!
I could reverse charge with Nokia N8🤭10 yrs back
11:57 kind of missing the Josh you had i don't know i just felt it
Well I bet Apple is subsidizing the games
not me having an iPhone SE 2020 🥲
My Realme GT2 had noise cancellation better than this in 2022
Did you only now discover voice isolation and live photos ? We've been using these for years.  HDR has been standard on the 9 year old 1080p resolution PS4. 720p resolution for gaming puts it right alongside the Nintendo switch 😂. Also a 1.5 speaker setup is not surround speakers.
Who is watching on the Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra?
Can you do a comparison between the s23 and iPhone 15😊
The saga begins🎉❤
Xiaomi > any other Android > Letters > Apple
I'm still waiting for iphone 20 to upgrade from my iphone10
What about the stereoscopic recording?
i opened this video thinking it was Marques' and started scrolling to see if Mr. had already uploaded something similar. I just started the video but wanted to express how happy it made me to find out this was a Mr. video x)
Oh, so people are finally starting to notice that titanium scratches more easily than steel? But I thought that the titanium frame would make the phone harder and stronger than EVER!... That is at least what almost every other YouTuber kept sprouting. Idiots, seriously. It takes a minute of googling to know that titanium alloys are significantly more prone to scratching than stainless steel.
The background music is abit too loud.
now show how lacking the non-pro models are and how most non-apple phones have had the "unique" iphone 15 features for years. Also having a material that doesnt bend at all isnt a good thing cause all the force that would usually be absorbed by the frame deforming will now go into sensitive insides and have a much higher chance to break them, same thing happened with cars like 50 years ago, they were built as tough as possible and all the force went into the driver, then they realized crumple zones were a better and safer design
Truly I didn't  watch full episode . What a bullshit
How did you download it please tell me or is it only available in usa ?
Arun has definitely upgraded his quality but his subscribe jokes still remains the same 😂😂
too good apple does small steps year by year, so we can master this small steps, i cant imagine a total different phone and features every year that makes ios sooooo much difficult to be compatible with older phones, apple is good with you, it says hey u got a 13 pro max.... youre ok
wow, you are not funny
Why does Apple get a pass when they copy Android features that have been around for ages, but Android phones are never given credit for having stuff? It's so stupid. Apple literally just went "oh we added some more stuff that it should have had and we'll gatekeep the rest because we can."  And all this is coming from a lifelong Apple user until this year.
No not better at all. Minor improvements over the 14 pro.
Related to the noise isolation feature: that’s specific to iOS 17, and not really an iPhone Pro feature, as are some others of the features mentioned.  And yes, titanium does scratch easily.
Literally waiting for your review since it's launch and finally its here❤❤❤
Waiting for the comparison 😊😊🤗
Dude sorry I can’t anymore. Your music, pace, and cocaine filled videos are too much. I’ll stick to MIBHD and Dave2D. I can’t concentrate with this insanity. Keep up the great success. It’s just not for me. I need to chill not get anxious.
I really miss the 5s
Apple is so happy to reduce E-waste even more.
Apple ka dalal
I have an s23 ultra and when you put them side to side in the real world the ultra is always for me the better phone I think it's marketing from Apple the way they were able to scam people to get this phone but if you want to do more and better it's always the s23 ultra either you work in the office you are in college at work for videos camera gaming is the most complete phone I've ever seen
I love how Arun doesn't waste our time but gives us factual information. Thanks Mrwhosetheboss😄❤
I only clicked on this video so YouTube would stop recommending this.
Now you are definitely an Apple fan boy
🤑💰
Bro said "driest" 😹💀
I thought I was the only one who ever leaned my phone against my cat 😂Hey, thanks for the content though, thinking of getting the iPhone 15 for my next upgrade. I think you pretty much sealed that deal for me. 😂❤
They paying this man crazy for this videos title huh
Why don't you to compare iPhone camera with the Pixel's?
Man, why has the viewership of this channel declined??   Even when the video quality just keeps getting better.🤨
I noticed after the last ios update the 14 pro max camera looked crappy. I think they downgraded the quality to make the 15 look good
Please do compare between xiomi 13 ultra
7:51 what are you doing arun?
How to get the iPhone background picture ?
I have the 14 pro max and voice isolation is present already. Not sure if the 15 pros have some improvements in the voice isolation. Thoughts?
This review feels like a phone software review
Not exactly impressive considering this is the largest comp y in the world. It’s a moderate evolution. Certainly not evolutionary.
This guy is definitely at different level when it comes to the tech review. keep it up!
best phone processor of 2023
its getting harder and harder to say good things about iphones lol
East or west...iphone is hilariously bad.
Wanted the 5x but I cant get on with the pro max size  standard 15 pro for me … ah well won’t miss what I never had !
Best explanation by far regarding the cameras. Thanks as always!
Thanks to samsung for the help
Sony phone style camera Botton
It's exactly as mediocre a supposed step forward as I know it is. Pretentious title.
While me watching whole video on my samsung😅
For the action button, you need to realize that people use their left hands as well...  I'm right handed and I use my left hand for my phone. Way easier to write things down or do something else, and it's not like swiping needs a ton of dexterity.
As much as mr who's the boss tried to make the phone seem very awesome it just felt boring all-round ☹️
14:21 what is that yellow thing under his shirt?
Does anyone actually use their phone without a case? I don’t get all this about fingerprints and feeling uncomfortable to hold
Looked like he was playing his cat 5:00 😂
I Don't know what kind of Vibe i am Getting through watching People Upgrading their Phones with Every newly launched premium Phones While my Phone is Still Growing in my Hand Since 4 Year. 😮😊
Your content is allways 10/10!👑
bro thought we won't get that unboxing joke
When you are trying to charge your iPhone 15 through powerbank and surprise......power bank starts charging 👽
Thank you, can’t wait to switch 😍
when's the battery test video coming outtt?
Now it’s time for roblox studio on iPads and phones
Does voice isolation work with Air Pods?
Do check if iPhone 15 cable gives toe USB3 speed when used with iPhone 15 pro
I feel Apple gathers the bugs or disadvantages of their newly launched phones even if they can correct it via software they dont instead they launch new product with those aforementioned fixes the next year. Sad that they stopped innovating
Do a detailed video on the A17 chip!! All specs covered!!😍
Pls give us mate 60 pro vs 15 pro comparison
I see what you did there, to engage your audience first you complained about the stuff it lacks but than you turned it around to make us engaged to the content.
Since the differences between 14 and 15 are insignificant, might as well comparing 15 and 16 from next year now. Nothing innovative. No no, the biggest difference is USB C cable... lol
If you are going to make a comparison to the S23 Ultra make sure you update it to the September software.
Voise isolation have my 13 pro it’s not new feature
cobalt battery also a recycled material♻️? is it can get through after 6 month of usage? i don't think so and pity Apple fans club that they get a new iPhone with all used before materials😞 i can't accept this😢
Your music was too lound, and it was quite hard to hear you
Better than you think❎ Expensive than you think✅
Just grabbed my wotah
Were you trying to imitate the "the satisfying end" unboxing 😂
Voice isolation has been around for at least a year I’ve been using in my iPhone 12
Need the background please
So scummy of apple to not have implement those pc/comsole games on ipads or macs even till now and theyre talking about phones now. Besides that its just mostly little software things?
Paid guy 😂
I'm going to be getting a 15 pro and am really torn between the pro and the pro max. Is the 5x camera and the battery worth upgrading to a phone that might be too cumbersome for daily use?
Erm like phones never had this capability but they just effin literal super c…… u…….. n………..
love frome bangladesh
Yeah, the entire phone could've been a software update
Can you sideload apps on iPhone now? I may actually switch to iPhone as a lifelong Android user if so.
Xbox x Cloud allows you to play every single  first party Xbox games including gears of war  Halo game at 1080p streaming through your smartphone no apple did not create or invent anything brand new.Aaron stop it bud. Xbox has been doing this for the past 2 years yes Microsoft!!!!!!!🔫😂☠🙂🕺🏾💪🏾
HEIF is already available on miui for years
15  pro max tatti phone
Trying hard to make it look like its good. Most of the features are available in a very stable form on Android flagships ,even in some mid ranger
Boring phone. 😂
I was using voice isolation already on iPhone 12 pro max, whats new on it?
Paid episode 😂
samsung been playing games apple still behind 😂
0:46 denamma hadavidi. Phone unboxing ki kuda gloves enduku ra nayana
Bundled with AirPlay… it could be the most portable PS4/Xbox360 on the go 🤔
Just a regular iPhone with Android features 😂 Not a bang for those bucks. Cook should give attention in battery power. Charging cycles still sucks.  Normal to potrait mode shift is already introduced in Andoids default Camera edit feature. I've k20 pro it's there already. 4 years early tech with 4x less money.
A phone that cost a $1000 no fast charging 😡
6:48 Almost dropped my savings there aron😭
Idk my iPhone 14 pro is still bad when compared to s23 ultra. For videos it’s a beast though.
iPhone 15 and TechImma1st
This was one of the mobiles I was waiting for release, But it is not much more worth than Samsung. Samsung has a more vast customizing and more Quality in Camera zoom 😎 and its a great review by Mrwhosetheboss.
Its like im watch a review from last model. Nothing here is exciting or new new.
First time on your channel. Great video mate. Subbed for some megapixels!
I hope one day they’ll fix the lens flare
It does make the colours of the cold London weather pop
My samsung also has voice focus mode
Still not a big difference than before...passsssss
Iphone's heif image is very efficient compare with android
my first language is french. So when you said dissimilar, I had to google. Never used or heard it.  You just said: it's not the same or it's not similar 😄  Thanks Mr.
Action button a bit of a gimmick, people who use accessibility features have been assigning actions to buttons and using gestures to control their phone for years.
My heart skipped a beat when you said "Let's talk about the design"
Live Photos is underrated.    My wife sends me pics of the kids and I love seeing the accompanying video that was auto-captured
first tech youtuber i comment . You are amazing and such awesome video
Not for me. Newest software can run on last year's phone.
Next level... nope next boring
The flip almost gave me a heart attack..........godammmmmn

apple = playstation  android = xbox
I think that M3 may be at least half time better than M2, because A17 Pro is approaching to the M1 performance
I've had every iphone pro max up until last month. I don't see why I would buy this 🤷‍♂ I went with something different and bought a fold 5
iPhone 15/15+ are the most compelling and value for money offerings that we've  seen for years from the base models,  it's basically an iPhone 14 Pro, definitely the one to get.
Not sure if this will get seen but it’s a question I’d love to get answered. When playing Resident Evil Village, was there a noticeable difference playing with touch screen vs using the external controller? That might seem odd to ask but the iPhone 14 Pro has a bug where games run better using a controller, and stutter when you touch the screen. If that’s been fixed, I’m definitely going to upgrade
About 3 years ago or so, there was this version of gcam mod which i used to have on my redmi note 7 which takes portrait shots when you take normal pictures. It'll give you your portrait shot in addition to your normal shots and save both of them. And with Google photos you could increase, decrease or remove the blur if you want
I will never use any iPhone no matter what technology or software features Apple adds to them. I LOVE Android & ChromeOS. Google for the win!
really thought the iphone 15 was a forgettable one ! but your video brings out the great aspects that are impossible to notice ;) Thank you Arun !
ARUN WHO TAKES LANDSCAPE PHOTOS IN 2023?! 😭  Voice isolation is cool tho
it looks like TIm did under commit but over delivered, i was disappointed with the presentation this year, but the phones looks promising than ever.
I use the up volume button as a shutter button. I suppose this might be a slight bit easier. But if we can still use the volume button we now have two buttons right near each other to use that way. I use the back taps for a number if functions. Very useful.  I’ve never understood why anyone cares about fingerprints on phones -any phone. Mildly annoying? Maybe, if you’re one of those anal individuals.
Apple is really running low on innovation 😂😂😂😂😂
Voice isolation mode is currently available on my iPhone 11 pro
Time to buy an iPhone 14 Pro Max. ✌️
Where can I find that wallpaper? (Purple one)
Volume down as shutter button on android 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 apple is too late to that
Can we connect galaxy watch 4 classic to iPhone 15 pro max
The voice isolation was already introduces with Iphone 12. 🤔🤔 And one more thing that No One mentioned ever is that On call if we set the earpiece speaker good enough to our ears it will work as a noise cancelation and removes background noise.... check that out you will be surprised ✌✌✌✌😎😎😎😎
Is 90% of this video is about the camera or have I looped it
YES
Please can send me an iPhone 13 because I am trying to get a new iPhone 13 but I can’t afford it I have still got the iPhone SE
Yo, can we talk about why he is playing resident evil on his cat?  What even lead to this?
15:00 why does he look like gigachad hmm 🤔
It's lighter by a gram
Where could I get those wallpaper?
What's wrong with taking photos using the volume up button?
What will do with raw power and performance if there is not much options for multitasking..
the pro max price has stayed the same in my country as last years 14 pro max thank goodness
I am watching view actually changing and looking at its amazing to see that😂
Me who doesn't know the difference of 13 ,14,15 by seeing those camera but I know it's a I phone which I don't want
AAA games means AAA storage space.
When is the battery drain test coming
I need a phone😭😭😭😭
First i will like Video , then i will watch ..This is the Confidence i have in Arun !!!!!!!!!
Watching in 15 Pro 💭😜
Am I the only amazed by camera , all the shots and everything the production quality of this video which was just spectacular?
giveaway?
no
still overpriced
the ios 17 update itself made many iphones go green..!! why nobody is addressing that!!??!!
bros background music is making me think to get the iphone15pro
Apples, whole advertising of USB-C on the prowl just drives me crazy. 1) they actually made a USB three version of lightning for the iPad Pro 10.5 inch back in 2017 that could do 5 Gb per second as opposed to the USB 2 lightning connector we got on the iPhone 14 Pro they can only do 480 Mb. This means that the 10 GB USB see controller is really only twice as fast as what lightning previously could do. It also means that Apple was intentionally deliberately reducing the speed that you could transfer data on the 14 pro. 2) it’s not USB 3, I understand why they called it that because the USB-IF has absolutely atrocious naming schemes so usb 3 rolls off the tongue easier than usb 3.2 gen 2, which is the official name of 10 Gb USB. But they could’ve just called it 10 Gb USB. Mark my words everyone is now going to run out and buy USB 3 accessories, as in USB 3.0 which has been re-branded to USB 3.2 gen 1, and then they’re going to wonder why they’re only getting 5Gb instead of 10!
I wish to watch a never ending video of mrwhoistheboss😊
I enjoy watching your videos rather than watching apple live event.
lovely crisp review..
Yep, iPhone 15 Pro Max is turning out to be the best phone for years to come.
Voice isolation has been on iPhone for a while now, I’ve been using it for what feels like ages
Don't stick up for Apple including a USB-C 2.0 cable on a $1200 phone!!
Wich "cuple" of apple stickers cause it's just one! One ! 1 ! Single piece ! Send me the double or triple ones you got,please! You and Marques mkbhd are going the wrong path . No Tim friend cause Tim steals from us!
Paid to shill.
Bro talking about already existing features because he wasn't able to find other features. Coz iPhone 15 pro doesn't any except usb C 😂😂😂😂
I know its dumb to watch this but what ever
Watching from s23 ultra
Dynamic Island lmao what a joke.
Should compare to the s24 tho
Voice isolation is not an iPhone 15 exclusive feature or a new feature at all. I’ve been using it since iPhone 13. Voice Isolation came to all the iPhones compatible with IOS 15 and voice isolation for regular phone calls came on IOS 16.4.
Its not worth the hype same old boring iphone upgrading to Samsung
a lot of talk to basically say "its the same as the 14 pro."
Here comes the Bixby Button.
@13:56 you call the iPhone an Samsung had me dying in my chair 😂😂😂
I think what they will do is come out with a portless regular iPhone, and keep a port on the pros. This will probably happen in the next couple years
arun plays bloons?
Mega Pixel????? Really??????😭😭😭😭
Voice isolation- wasn’t it before?
Correction, PS4 did support HDR. Games like Uncharted 4 did support it on PS4 consoles.
6:26 Regarding the console/PC level games coming to Android, I thought one of the main reasons this was possible was due to Metal?  Is that not the case?
Can you make a video about baget phones that it's worth it to buy
hasn't voice isolation on normal calls been a thing since ios 16.4?
iPhones are so damn overpriced
The main work for an iPhone has remained same since iPhone x what do u want to do with your phone will it replace your work laptop or computer (dekstop). No right. So it's in hindi " bakwas"
How much are they!?😂
You can already swipe up and then take photos with the volume button… I see no benefit to tying the action button to that.
I wonder how much did apple pay him for this review, lol
Commenting till 1M subs😅@❤ u all
Milo just sat there as the stand 😂
Damn what happened to your in-studio camera, half your face is blown out and you're rocking a white stripe down the center of your face.
2:07 nokia smiling in corner
Inside you have USB-C 2.0 and if you want 3.0 cable you have to pay 40-50$,€ or £ (on Apple store of course) to have 3.0 cable because normal usb-c cable don’t work very well on Iphone you have ro buy an usb-c iphone cable and of course you have to pay for charger(who need to buy made by apple to have fast charge)😂😂😂
Where can I get that wallpaper?
Fully biased review
AYO CHILL
how much did apple pay you to make this video 😂😂😂😂
How much  they paid you mrwhostheboss we waiting for the iPhone 16
Another episode of I want it but I can't have it 😔.
@Mrwhosetheboss you don't mentioned the greatest thing in the iPhone 15 pro , which is the 3nm chipset , which is the best among any smartphone out there , if you're agreeing , please give your emotions in respond to this comment 🤗
wait what usb c to lighting ???????????????????????????????????????
The fact that you have found so many improvements from the 14 and enough to make a 20min video is mind boggling ... 🤣
The voice isolation on facetime has been there since iPhone 14 Pro
Just skip this and save your money, if someone coming from 13 or more 14 Pro max😅
I have been feeling this for a while now that Arun is getting biased towards Apple. The older videos were perfect, with no biased opinion, telling what a vast and I mean it a vast majority of people will agree on but now some of his opinions will be agreed by only an Apple fan. Earlier if a feature was added for say Apple but it was already in for say Samsung, he would tell that in the video. But now he doesn't mention that instead, he shows that the feature is all-new. For example in this video only, when he mentioned the auto-portrait feature thing, he showed that the feature was all new but it already exists in Android by using the Google Photos app. I am not a MrWhosetheboss hater in fact I am a very big fan of him but I just thought I should convey my thoughts.
your cat looks like our cat, a cutie
my huawai has USB C since ever xD
Ladies & Gentleman! I am sorry to say, but we are at the Peak of Smartphone Era, and it is coming to an end. Literally we have explorer every aspect of smartphone, that companies have nothing new to add. They will move on to virtual reality now. What you gonna get now is not gonna mean alot  as there will be software side improvement.  Now avg smartphone can cover a people needs. Lets see what's comming up next
Bro literally used the whole video to talk about the camera 😂
14:48 the video looks so fake to me, that I fully expected you to sit in front of a greenscreen and turn the background off next.
Cut the gloves brother,do not use them
4:53 why did he use cat as a phone stand?
iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max = refinement & better user experience   In my opinion Apple has taken what was good about the iPhone and made it better in all the key areas. Screen got brighter, battery got bigger, camera got better, Titanium is an upgrade over stainless steel, better modem, and the new A17 chip is faster and better for gaming...you add it all up and it's a different phone with an upgraded user experience. I thought the iOS 17 upgrade was "boring" but then you notice at least 10 useful changes and my iPhone 14 Pro Max feels different and better...same with AirPods Pro. I thought the new features were hype but Adaptive Sound and Conversation Mode are now my defaults and it feels like I have new AirPods Pro 2 as a result. Apple NAILED it this year with refinements and as a result their products feel fresh and more fun to use
The review was fantastic. But I’m equally amazed at how well you kept my attention for the whole video!
Same thing literally
He got a SIM card slot!!!!!!
That price for the Pro Max looks good to me: I paid £1309 for a 256gb 14 Pro Max last October.
Still not worth it to upgrade from an iPhone 12
Omg
Trisha fatigue setting in video after video 😅
Yawn….. the S23 Ultra still is the standard
Absolutely loved the review ❤ but I’ve begun to wonder about the credibility about early reviews compared to longitudinal reviews - thoughts?  Tech moves fast, but it also matures in different ways with every iteration 🤓
How much did apple paid you for this advertisement bro the phone still looks like an iPhone 5 and half a second faster browser, until apple purposely slow down the older iPhones so that people can purchase new iPhones thanks but no thanks
Well paid Arun  Well paid
I don’t know why ppl worry about the weight, hit the gym? I like the heavy phones but I’m Still getting this one cause I have a 13 pro max
Really need a full comparison of the 3x telephoto on the Pro with the 5x on the Pro Max
Watching this on my 4 yr old vivo y20i phone, 🎉
Over hyped phone...
It was truly beyond my imagination. I want to own it now
What's more amazing is how you actually managed to stretch what's new on the iPhone into a 20 minute video
IN WHAT LORD WAY THE CABLE WAS AN UPGRADE THAT YOU HAD YO SUBTITLE WITH BIG FONTS? IF ITS NOT A STANDARD FAST CHARGER CABLE  IN WHICH WAY IT IS AN UPGRADE  JUST FOR THAT STUPID MATERIAL..????  REALLY ???? REALLY?????
Can someone confirm if the AAA games can run on base 15 models? Or if it is possible for it to do so?
Moral of the story:   Buy the same phone with a little bit of more performance + some more camera features 😅
sounds cool but no thanks im sticking with android
Hahah, we used to have a dedicated camera button in every phone 10 years back!  Now this is the best feature ever🤣🤣
How these videos look clean even at low quality, is it adaptive high bitrate , don't know.
9.5/10 people I know use phone cases. So many reviews talk about the touch / feel but most users rarely touch the actual phone. How of you use a case?
iPhone 15 pro seems to be the buy, most regular pics are going to be better with the 3x than the 5x zoom, and in the US it is 200$ less
Ugh.. nah..
Didn't Google introduce the blur feature like a year ago??
Wow u still have d gold plating on your PS5 that is impressive boss I thought you just put it for the videos
The 15 is what the 14 should have been
woooo
Are you not allergic to the cat
How much did you get to hock this crap
aren't u holding ur camera upside down?
I want that wallpaper!
the meatridin is crazyyyyy
So iphones can store more than 100 call logs now?
Where did you get that wallpaper 😂 if anyone has the link that would be great
Its an iphone with a camera 😂
i really don't know but this video seems like Apple sponsored it... but really great info
Great video!
All Youtubers are trying so hard right now to tell you that 15s are actually different
*Somehow I’m using voice isolation feature for FT and calls on my 13 pro from last 1 year* 😂
My 12pro max is pretty heavy lol. It might be a reason for me to upgrade
Please do honor reviews, 😢
Waiting for techburners video
Lol, i feel like he is trying hard to find positives of the phone.
Given I have the steam deck and steam games on my account, the gaming thing seems pointless to me because of lack of cloud safes like between the PC and the deck and also having to buy the game again from the App Store. If Steam made their app eventually play their games on the phone then I’d be interested but for now it seems like a novelty.
Is it any louder
I think it will be fair and right for all your subscribers to come clean and to admit that you work for Apple… because the difference is massive between a honest review and paid prompt video…
4:43 so much power only to play ps games on such a small screen, don't get me wrong it looks hilarious to see you play like that
8:22 RICK ROLL I HEARD IT DON'T TRY AND TRICK MEEEE
How is it better than the 14 pro max?
paid review lol
Easy to know you are not using a Samsung phone. They also have HEIF. But you guys never promote all those features for them but can promote even a ringtone sound for Apple pathetic
Mrwhosetheboss is one of the coolest YouTubers. And the best tech YouTuber.
Thanks for all the info, awesome video as always
Meh
When the pixel 8 comes out you Betta review it.
Hu Arun please also consider doing reviews on the regular and plus models of the iPhones
Im not a apple fan but those improvement on gaming looks so promising.. the genshin impact one is more closer to ps4 level graphics now compared  to a high-end gaming phone graphics and also you can literally play a pc game with it which is understandable because the new chip is almost mac level but still so surreal to think about it.
"80% of the photos I take are in landscape mode" 😂😂😂 Nah the dvckriding is too much. Absolutely no one take the majority of their photos in landscape mode, but he had to make the action button seem useful.
Love how informative the video is. And the part about the camera photos and file sizes. Really is amazing
4:10 had to re watch this part I was focused on the background phonk music lol
can't believe he never talked about video..
I'm Noticing Arun becoming an Apple Fanboy drastically😂
Gold PS5 is crazy 😭
This happens every year. Everyone hates it when it’s announced and then they use it and it’s BEST IPHONE EVER
Wallpaper link please
1.9k dislikes... i think these people failed to digest pro max level praise of all the ground braking innovations  of iphone 15 pro max.
Can we take a moment to appreciate his choice of BGM. Well done brother.
It looks like paid promotion
5:07 i think that playing console games on a phone just isnt good... Im not saying that apple did a horrible job at it. Infact i think its the perfect excecution. But just the screen is to smol
i hoped for a punch hole though
Apple : TAKE NOTES GUYS WE GOTTA DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE IN THE NEXT IPHONE!!!
Did i just hear fnaf security breach music?
The 12 and up all have isolation mode
6:47 brand new phone and arun is already throwing it in the air..😅
my 12 pro max also has  voice isolation what is new about that???
I was in so much pain when I saw Drisha leave the tap on, some part of me just wanted to turn the tap off 😂
A thunderbolt port would have come handy for gaming on TV
“Ayo chill” 😂
MEGA-PIXEL😁, BARS my Boss
It's kind of embarrassing how hard it is to sell/review flagship smart phones nowadays. When you see the same shiny visuals and scripting that you're used to, but they're desperately trying to pitch things like 'USB 3.0 in 2023' and 'a shortcut button you can't reach' as though they were actually significant improvements.
Waitibg for Call me shazam video 😂
Bro most of the features you said is already available in iPhone 14 Pro phones… atleast 80% mate
I stick with my samsung s23 plus 😏
It's feels like iPhone 14s kinda boring ngl
did anybody notice that at 4:20 the iphone 14 pro max shows aruns food arriving in 15 mins from uber eats
I am very happy for u and ya fiance' 😢😢😢😢 i dont have someone to call my own😢😢😢😢😢
9:29  I don't know if this comment will reach you (Arun), You were using the samsung with motion photos turned on, which naturally resulted in lower shutter speeds since you need time to capture some motion.  If any of you are watching this, please copy and re-comment my comment.
Your chair screams in pain every time you make a video
broke me enjoying the reviews 🤡
wallpaper link?
Wallpaper link plz
im curious how much they payed so he doesnt say its the same xd
is it not coming out on 22 september  if it is how did you get it
apple got really pissed when samsung got to their level of photography
Catch : 😂Gaming comes with 2 hours of battery life
Camera comparison with s33u and ip15pm please!
That voice isolation is just insaneee!!!!
I'll gladly take your old iPhone 14 from you. Please and thank you 😁
Hello
iPhone 15 pro max is the dream of the poor like us💔
Why is my iPhone 6 max flash light more brighter than my 14pm no one is able to answer this question.
I knew when you started to mention gaming you’d refer Genshin.
Let's guess how much he gets paid by apple for these videos
i find you very fake ....this features have been in android for a long period of times i haven't seen you making videos about those....always glorifying iphone ..never trusting your words again
Apples battery degradation does seem to be worse than android. I had a 12 and the battery life was amazing when I first got it one year later and it was barely making it past 4pm
One of the worst upgrade ever apart from 14
Hi.. mr. iPhone's salesman
So does it hot running the game ? That’s the main concern. As a consumer we don’t care is it capable we only care it is practical. If it got insanely hot it’s just not suitable to game on it
iOS 17 just removed the ram clear feature Not appreciated Apple 😢
Interesting to see how the S23 Ultra compares with iPhone 15 Pro, given how good Samsung has closed the gap in terms of camera performance
iPhone 16 will be Next level (as per your thumbnail iPhone 15 is, which is not imo).
🇧🇩❤️🇧🇩
Action button reminds of lumia.
My kidneys are itching
Small nitpick, but last Gen consoles definitely supported HDR.
Does the natural have PVD coating? I want the coating as it adds resilience to stretches
His voice 🔥🔥
ok but can someone tell me how you put ur phone on silent mode if the action button is set to sumthin else
Voice isolation is on the 14 also…
Can anyone point me to the wallpaper at 4:11. I want it lol
He grabs his phone weirdly, the button is extremely easy to get to.
Does the background noise reduction also work with the AirPods Pro 2?
If this comment gets  23 likes i will do absolutely nothing
@Mrwhosetheboss, can you kindly send me the Iphone14 Pro Max since you are not using it anymore?🙏🙏🙏
Is apple paying this guy to say this?
In EU it's 50€ less
review the new 'Mac Studio'
The 100% absolutely useless apple sticker is just PURE plastic trash that will end up in the ocean or landfill.  WHY?
Yeah. No reviewers want to get on Apple bad reviewer list to get an exclusive opportunity. But we still watch them tho😂
The only ads in video which i dont mind because of the MrBoss content ❤️
Which phone manufacturer Will make a better phone in the next six months, this is the phone to beat.
The fact that we are calling it "normal pro" model is very ironic😂
ok, maybe I'm weird, but I never hold my phone at the bottom and my fingers naturally rest on teh buttons. Rarely Do hold it elsewhere.
Mrwhostetheboss, blink twice if your being held against your will.
Voice isolation is not exclusive to the new iPhones.
The voice isolation is a feature that already exists! I have a 13 pro max and use it always and love it!
AND ALSO I WANT TO KNOW    MR. BOSS     ive been using samsung from a  long time  now     i wanted to switch to google pixel 7     but im not sure if its  a good decision   or if i would  like   and alos if it has all the features that samsung offers   plz   guide me and help   a   brother
Pre order done  🇧🇩😂
6:26 sounds so wrong out of context 💀💀💀
Its dumb. Apple got rid of the silent switch. I would go to meetings and just flip the switch in my pocket,  its on silent mode. Now, I have to look at it and make sure I pressed the right button and settings to put it on silent. Android users been asking for a switch similar to iPhone. If it's not broken don't fix it. Don't get me started on phone design. I don't wanna hear Apple fans criticizing other manufacturers about phone design cause Apple hasn't change in more than 8 years now
Too little too niche
I wish I had an iPhone, I can't afford even an iPhone 6
cant wait till he does a s24 ultra review
Even I , as an apple fanboy, didnt notice how much changed
When was i phone 15 launched
I thought the video was already over when you said the cam comparison is coming soon😅
i'm really hoping u will gift me a 15 pro max for real
Stop trying to push this garbage and give ideas on how the iPhone can actually do better with innovation like why the hell do they keep the notch well for next year of course 😂
The new portait mode in iPhone is not the new in smartphone industry even huawei had the same feature in 2018 called aperture mode, and I think this iPhone produce low quality image when you zoom your image you can easily notice the blur but your presentation skill don't let us notice this, I think huawei and Samsung both have the best camera system than iPhone but due to iPhone a top brand name our mind automatically guesses that it probably the best camera but it's not, may be future updates can solve the blur problem, also the edge detection not good as the Samsung
For normal every person use….no real difference aside from price.
Why aren't you mrwhostheboss? Without the e.
Bro saying that is safe to say  iphone 15 is better than iphone 14 Like what was apple supposed to do for 1 year if there was no change
Click bait af
‘There is no one big defining feature…’ - well apart from 10Gb USB-C lol 😂
LISTREN UP  MY PEOPLE    SAMSUNG HAS IT ALL   SINCE WHEN   THEY OPENED  THE SHOP   THE FIRST DAY
Voice isolation was already introduced in 14 pros lines up… 3:30
Please make a video on SAR value on various I phone models
Sponspored by what you think.
so excited for friday when i get my pro max
You talk like Ali abdaal 😂. Great review
Is 256gb enough for the 15 pro max or should I get 512?
Misleading review sir, it's not standard for most phones to support usb 3.0 speeds and not get the cable with it. If a 1000 pound Android phone did this you'll be complaining for ages but apple always get off easy. I wonder why🤔🤔🤔
bro can't you buy me an iphone15 pro max and send me?☺
Nokia did that camera button with N73 15 years ago
Innovation 😂😂😂

Is the portrait photo feature only available on the 15s? Or is that coming down to any phone that can run iOS 17?
So Bethesda got platform to launch Skyrim Again!
This ads is really big. 😅😅
Where's the In-display fingerprint sensor 😅??
Any thoughts on bringing back fingerprint?
battery test next please
Isnt there some movement about being able to download APIs to the iphone like on Android? If so, then the iPhone 15 be amazing to emulate games on :D
Of course you don’t care. But man your videos are so noisy and fast. Like they’re on speed/cocaine. I don’t enjoy them as much as other tech youtuber’s.
Love from Bangladesh 😊
Well, at least we can finally share our chargers the way it was meant to be over 9 years ago
Can’t play serious games without a controller/keyboard
You cempletely skipped talking about macro capabilities of the wide with the pro. I am curious about this becasu emy wife loves talking macro shots on hikes.
Really like the way of comparison between the 14 and 15. You got really small things in comparison. I really appreciate that.  Iphone 14: 172gm Iphone 15: 171gm Iphone 14 pro and pro max: 206 &240gm Iphone 15 pro & pro max: 187 & 221gm Where there is so much comparison in weight in iphone pro and pro max but it is almost same in iphone 14 and 15 since titanium body is also used in that. Please make a full vedio explaining these facts. Love from Bangladesh.
im hoping that samsung one ups iphone
first
6:32 i don’t think the galaxay flagships sell enough to justify porting console games to android. plus android users buy things less
by the way, a major downside of the 15 pro max is that Apple still didn't add AI capabilities, so you can't natively erase people in the background of your photo, like you can on a pixel phone. although maybe there's a paid app that can do that.
I don't agree with "It is a standard for almost every phone" for a less speed type-c cable being provided. Every type-c cable I have seen support the fastest transfer speeds that the phone can support. Apple should do the same with iPhone cables.
They are still bad compared with Samsung.
As always, features are not first in smartphones, however implementation is arguably the best. If Apple ever decided to open up their OS (doubt), I may consider an iPhone, but for now, pass.
So bias... Its the same shit!!
Can you please include Huawei Mate 60 Pro for the camera comparison?
can you try using trd party type c bricks and cable(xiaomi or huawei or any other android) on the new iphone and see how the result came. Curious if 100w bricks could charge that fast or not
Not everyone buys a new iPhone every year. I bought my iPhone 11 Pro brand new when it dropped and still use it today. THIS is the phone I’ve been waiting for; compare a 15Pro to an 11Pro. Better front and back cameras, ProMotion 120hz display, titanium frame, better speakers, battery, chipset, storage, ram, peak display brightness, always on display, dynamic island, no more mute switch, ceramic shield glass, USB-C, MagSafe, better designed chassis, better microphones, 5G connectivity, more features like AAA roadside assistance. The list goes on. All these upgrades for essentially NO EXTRA COST. My iPhone 11 Pro cost $1000, this 15Pro will also cost $1000. Even with all this inflation!!! They are selling a product that’s better in EVERY category for the same price as the old one YEARS ago. So you are getting better deals today than just in 2019. Quit buying a new phone every year and you will feel the upgrades they make!
"when you see someone with an older phone it makes you appreciate you're new phone" attempt to pull out an iPhone 13
Why all are praising the same shit
Everyone talks about the USBC port as an upgrade Apple decided to do, it was not. The EU passed a law that required all phones to use the port to make cables universal. So Apple had no choice.  The EU has also passed a law that goes in effect in a couple years requiring the ability for the customer to easily change batteries.   Regardless, all speculation about future no port phones is moot, the EU law requires it so it is here to stay and Apple is not happy about it. They fought the law hard but lost.
The only two big differences I see between the iPhone 14 and 15 is that Apple fixed the bad heat management of the iPhone 14, and switched from the archaic lightning port to an USB-C port - without using the speed advantages brought by the latter. The remaining changes are a number of incremental improvements which, in a pragmatic way, do not justify a £1000+ expense...
Camera comparison with xiaomi 13 ultra?
❤❤❤❤ for Bangladesh
Even though you buy the best charging cable, the iPhone 15 Pro would still charges up to 18w only... It's 2023 and the iPhone charging is still slower than a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone..
So the action button is just an s pen.
Apple just stole me with the 15 pros
Me seeing the flashlight on “ayo your flashlights on!”
Maybe it is time to get a backbone controller for the phone
Yeah, this will be my second venture into iPhone land, first being the 12 Max, HATED it, but hey now they're on the USB C train, and I'm interested, also EXTERNAL DRIVE SUPPORT. YAY. Bring Apple Pencil Support and well, BYE BYE SAMSUNG. Edit: I don't love my iPads, but since the mini for the past 2-3 Generations was the only GOOD small tablet with stylus support, I bought one, and I love it for that support. I rely heavily on styluses. My monitors support them, my tablets do, my phones as well. I like drawing, using them as notebook replacements, etc.
Battery life test vs 14 pro max
If any one want to giveaway old one  i am there 😭😔
I was looking into if I should buy the 15 Pro and I was pretty sure I was going to buy it. Then I started to think more and realised that I don't take pictures so the camera is useless, yes the 120hz display is nice but I don't really need it and also I wanted to get more storage so the base 15 would be alot cheaper even with upgraded storage.
Look let's be honest doesn't matter what is the iPhone series is, we all will be exited
I kinda boring
DID BOTH HAVE IOS 17? IF NOT , REPEAT TESTS!
The 11 pro/Xs size was the best imo. If they had 120hz I would use them over the new ones
Send me the last gen iphone pro or max.
Paid review 😊
2:15 Do you think, instead of just going to the settings for Action Button on the iPhone touchscreen interface... It will be much easier to give voice commands to set Action Button in case of spontaneous real time situational requirements like saying, "Hey Siri, set Action Button settings to camera with such and such sub-configurations", for the camera, accessibility, record audio, etc and same for other features?   Or just select a pre-recorded or pre-saved and tagged command headings and give the voice commands saying, "Siri, set Action Button to 'Camera1' Or 'Camera2' Or 'Camera3' for camera settings Or "Accessibility1" Or "Accessibility2" accessibility settings" and same for other Action Button facilities!?!
So..... Nothing substantial
Biased review
new smartphones are now all hype to sell superficial cosmetic change. Just need one that works
The problem is wireless charging is that I have to have my phone facing up, I don’t really want that because if I get a notification it’s gonna be distracting.
2 h gang
Is it worth upgrading from 14 pro max?
Here's what's new with the new iphones, *price*
Rare found footage of a man who plays genshin impact and has a wife
OK android phones are real gaming phones yeah right the real gaming phone now is the iPhone I’m surprised that an iPhone can run a console game with just six CPU core that’s amazing what’s gonna happen when they hit 8 cpu cores 😱 android is now becoming more garbage🤣🤣🤣
You better be this positive when the s24u comes out from little changes
Battery testttttt
The voice isolation thing was already in 14 pro and other older devices
I need this wallpaper!!! 🥲
NOT SOLD ... despite your efforts 🤠 I absolutely see no reason to upgrade from 14 Pro. I'll only upgrade if Apple gives me $800 trade-in discount.
One thing that people don't mention is that, even though titanium is stronger and lighter, it is also a poor heat conductor compared to aluminum. This means that heat dissipation could be a problem if Apple did not address it internally.
You're talking about the portrait depth info as if it's magic or new, but you should've mentioned that with Google Pixel you can change a 10-year old normal photo to protrait mode without any restrictions, even if the photo was taken by an old iPhone :D
19:19 Well £1199 GBP converted in USD $1486 which is $287 dollars extra then US price not fair and that is simply  theft
I think Brandon Butch  said that people have problems with 14 price because it was hot this year,,, not everyone has a problem with iPhone 14 Pro 😊 Erin my 14pro I have 411 month I still have 100% battery even after I install iOS 17 yesterday …….. and I’m gonna lose it for at least one more year how it’s supposed to be……..😊
Yes, it's better than you think when you don't think.
I came for that animation
The only company to make the same products since 2017 and have people go crazy over them
Sorry but you come off as a massive shill here
Most of the features are from software side do we will get them in 14 pro max after some system updates?????
Sorry, for this price, it's only better than I think, if it drives me to work and cooks my dinner.
In conclusion, nothing has changed with the iphone 15s
Can I get the wallpaper used in thumbnail plz😍
Apple’s marketing on the 24,28,35,48mm is really for the old school photo nerds who shot prime lenses. I think that was the marketing for constant zoom lenses in the past. 24-70mm f2.8 is like having a 24,28,35,50 and 70mm primes.   Since their quality is pretty good from 1x to 2x which is 24,28,35,48mm I think their user wouldn’t mind. Might be a good thing for budding photographer if they want to decide on buying a wideangle prime or standard lens which is 50mm. Or people scouting on their phones on which prime to mount.
Tht will heat tht phone up bad lol it will melt the iPhone playing tht
Nobody mentiones anytyhign about the 3nm porcessor, does the phone feel less hot when it's pushed ?
So your time with the flip 5 was short.
Did you say that was Beyoncé or your fiancé
Can't wait to start hearing Arun say, My Wife 😂😂❤❤❤
Youre crowing coz your phone can play four (😂) games when everyone else has had Xbox Live with over 100 games on their phones for ages. As usual, behind the times yet still allegedly superior 😅
Arun Trying Hard To Prove The New iPhone Has Many New Features.
Once they get the A17 Pro in a none Pro iPhone, Apple TV, iPads and Macs, they will have a complete AAA gaming ecosystem
Make a video on battery working hours
Bro i know why you are making mistakes in iphone 15 pro max that doesn't exist because now you are a samsung promoter so you will tell only samsung is good but actually i phone iphone personality with i phone gaming king i phone video quality king i phone all over i phone first smart phone i phone 🥶😈🥵😎
The back tapping feature is sick....they should incorporate it for other features
Same old wine 😏😂🤣🚶🏾‍♂️
Everyone expects the camera to be better then the last gen and they always been doing that, action button really not necessary just another button to take up space at the side if your phone specially when you got your power button that can do the same but other then that the major update for this phone has to be the fact that now android users and iPhone users can share the same charger unlike before.
The only decent thing this line up offers is usb c and they didn't even put the fast connection in all there phones 😂
What is the use of high pc game available  in  small screen and highly  heating chip without proper cooling. If wanted to focus in gaming. Than screen for Pro max should be 6.9 and  with good cooling that  would sky rock mobile sale
I wish they would bring back live photo lock screens.
So all they are doing is anc on the mic wow 😂
4:09 Does anyone know the song that’s playing in the background?
Ye ye, we know that you are an apple fan boy. It's not like this is an objective video anyway.
thanks Arun.
MKBHD said he didn't think the 6 days he had the the phone was enough for a full review by his standards and I know it wasn't a jab at anyone in particular but I couldn't help but think of you.
still not very sold :/ for the more average user, all of the new features aren't a worthwhile buy... Maybe if you're at your 5 year mark...
Android: Let us introduce new feature Apple: Let us copy android and make it better
wauw.. it can run games similar to a 10 year old console!  is that impressive? it doesnt seem like it I mean, maybe in the future we'll see something more impressive but .. I'd wanna see digital foundry comparing them in "full" size screens
I came from Samsung to Apple when the iPhone 12 came out. I am going back when the new Samsungs come out next year
Fun fact : apple must have asked him or also paid him to make this video so that the iphone won't be a fail 😮.  Disclaimer: This might not me accurate information
All these Samsung Apple videos with no substance other than being a boring ad... Waaaaaay too many. Goodbye :)
Watching something that I know I can't afford 😢
The only tech reviewers that I'm watching right now is Arun and Marques. ❤
Tht action button was in a blackberry year's ago tht lens isn't true zoom
What I see is Apple being very happy with the iPhone 14 and just updating it to stay relevant and adding a little extra
Great video diffrent information to other reviews
I love the Noise isolation mode, but Sony xperia 1 ii had it first, so coming from Sony xperia 1, ii it's nothing really new, but maybe from another iPhone or android will be a big improvement
The portrait image editing is nothing new. I dono why tech channels are hyping it so much.
Wallpaper?
s23u 10x optical zoom iphone 15pm 5x oltical zoom  😮
Wait.   Back tap?!  Got my first iPhone last year and didn’t know about this.
please make a battery test of every top phones from Samsung and apple including the 14 pro and max
this iphone is the worst upgrade possible, i was expecting atleast the notch to be smaller for the pro series. this is the biggest scam for people who will upgrade from 14 pros. only but if you have a 11 or 12
you and ur dang rickrolls
Awesome video !!
Just keep your old iPhone this isn’t as flashy as he’s making out it’s incremental improvements, if you have a 12/13/14 it’s really not worth it
Seriously are u even a tech reviewer at this point now, it's crap it has no true innovation behind it
I think you have quit working out now.
Whaaat 14:35 pro max have larger sensor and better stability 😮
To be honest these things are not worth it to spend that much on upgrade. Because most of these can be pushed via software update. If apple wants.
Hi Arun! I seem to have the voice isolation feature on my iPhone 14 Pro as well as my wife’s iPhone XS. Probably, a feature introduced with iOS 17.
Do a giveaway.. coz i really really want one but i can't afford 🥺😶😹...
do people know u can use the volume down button as the shutter button? :p
what song played when he said "the sound quality of a great audio system" at 8:22?
Honestly the action button alone is what has me sold. Anything to go back to the old Xperia days (back when they cared about the bigger phone market and not just camera enthusiasts) with the dedicated camera button. Every phone I've gotten since then has felt slightly lacking.
wait, I had a voice isolation mode since like 2 years, what is new in it?
Samsung galaxy S23 ULTRA vs Iphone 15 Pro Max 😅
When Apple feels the hate brings those YouTubers to talk highly about their products
Apple Lied...  I don't play games but when it comes to the Camera's? Watch a Professional Photographer Video on why the 14 Cameras are much better..  Also, don't catch that painted band! 😅  I love the 13 Pro. SS Band just have a beautiful look.
Arun grows his facial hair for camera experimentation purposes only
i'll keep my pro max 13 for another year!
The pro max did not come up 100$  It’s an equal price as last years 256, they just got rid of the 128 because no one I knew got a 128 everyone got 256 or greater. So for a majority of the people I know it’s the same price
Waste phone of the year Gose to iPhone 15 generation
I was eagerly waiting for this video for a while.
in my country pro and pro max are 150 off!
love the phone. but we can't afford 😢
Some nice iPhone 15 Pro flashlight action between 15:15 and 15:26
Y’all aren’t tired of these reviews yet!? It’s the same exact shit year after year.
Fresh fresh pls it's sponsored😅😅
hello
bro just shot an ad for iphone better then iphone
first time seen this guy and i like his charisma and the way he reviews products
Me who couldn't focus on the vid because his head was so shiny
studio lighting is to bright bro ,it shows your makeup
Hi
Bull 💩 they pay big YouTubers very well
I hate iphones
I'm so used to the quality on this channel that when i see it over exposed (to much light?)like this it's super noticable
Only 5 seconds in, I'm sending my condolences to Arun's sleep schedule for the day in which he annually does the new iPhone's battery test. Dunno if it is this video, usually it is a separate one, but yeah, best of luck that day, my man.
The sound guy for this video needs a raise!!
Going to buy the 15 pro max. Coming back to iPhone after a long time. Last one was the 4s and I really liked that phone.
Apple seems to have maxed out in the design department.
I just checked Apple's number of subscribers, and we're still 2M behind them. I found a channel that made a stats prediction, and it says that Arun's team will surpass Apple by January 2024... that's realistic, but if we can make it sooner... the sooner we'll see the big iPhone content. Looking forward to it!
Can i ask for your old Iphone.? 😢Just one here in PH, just a fan request from you guys.
Watching with so much concentration as if I am gonna really buy that gold nugget 😂... But I loved the video! ❤
Great Video. Where's the Wallpaper from ?
Came from an mkbhd video, felt uninformed. Came here, fully informed. Thank you.
apple: we want to save the environment and water with our phones Arun: wastes tap water to test voice isolation
2:00 Youre holding the phone in landscape upside down.
How much Apple paid you to do this video?
W VIDEO W PHONE CANT WAIT FOR IT TO RELEASE
Cool but, no thanks.
another Sheep Video ... nothing more nothing less! Come on bro ... DONT BE that guy
Me using my phone camera 10 times a Year...
Astonishing! 😲
Lol ever iPhone  that com out yearly is better than you think 😅😅 ain't that the point  in having a new model 16 is gonna be better and then 17,18,19,100 lol😅
Thanks
Please Share With Us The Purple /Blue Wallpaper
Never in my life have I cared about an iPhone as much as I do now due to the option of gaming. Trust me no f ing way I am playing resident evil village on that shity small screen at 720p but give me stary, Hades, westorado, genshin, doom, and dota a lot of games which feels just right for this type of screen. Is the greatest thing that can happen due to the possibility of portability of these things is unbelievable
Didn’t name a single thing that is new to the market
MrWhosetheboss when Samsung comes up with an iterative phone: Its very similar, Samsung needs to do better. MrWhosetheboss when Apple comes up with an iterative phone: Its better than you think. Its really good, this is innovation. I'm a fan of yours but the Hypocrisy man
Apple doesn't go all out in terms of design of their iphone
Bro p didn't know that l just saw the button when l bought it thanks
Lidar?
Arun try to not glaze apple challenge: impossible
mehhh
I have big hands, the action button is fine where it is 🤷🏽‍♂️
Looking forward to the battery test!
I have to say this, despite al the good little features Apple has added , Apple 'INNOVATION' is literally dead for the past 4 years , from iphone 11 to iphone 15
Congratulations 🎉, now the people would stop to buy PS5, and start to buy a apple 15 pro 😂😅😂😅
bruh i didnt even know that back tap existed
Always support Apple for growth 🔥🔥. No matter how shitty the upgrade is
Great phone, but I'll never be able to afford even an 11 pro lol..الحمد للله على كل حال.. @Mrwhosetheboss very nice video as always thank you a lot bro!!!
Voice isolation has been here scine a loooong time and even works on my 11 pro
Better then you think cause they did SOmEtHiNg
Same phone but very marginal changes
How does Google's 'Blur' feature on Google Photos compare to the iPhone's 'Depth focus control'?
🤣🤣🤣🤣Mr Bean
Sokhian mar Raha hai burger
WoW! Another one!
When u got the samsung flagship but looking at the iphone 15 pro max gives u a tingle to go and buy it immediately. PS - Also u are broke after buying the samsung flagship.
At this point apple can watch these videos and conclude their product performance analysis
andrid have the manual portrait since 2021
Idk why no charging adapter on the box what a shame
Hey, Arun people love to receive phones as a gift.
I'm surprised you still get the stickers. I would have thought they'd do away with them. I never know where to stick them where they might look aesthetically nice (I'm used to the logo being ON the Apple product) and I feel like it'd be free gains for their carbon neutral goals.
I used to love his channel but clearly he is now making money from these companies and not even highlighting that OVERALL its the same old shit launched which we are dealing with since Iphone 11. Why cant he say that? Not bec he can not but because its not part of the paid deal. Sure he tells some cons to make the review look natural
Its just a 14 pro s
The iPhone got so wort and i will unlike this video because u lying because they pay u sponsorship
Going for something positive... Arun.. but let me know why I should play ps5 game in iPhone since ps5 half the price of iPhone😅
So annoying how every video now of Mrwhosetheboss is set to 360p while other creators I have no problem of setting to 4k 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
At this point it seems like these tech youtubers are finding it very hard to make these new iphones sound exciting. It's always interesting to see what new bs they will feed us in the name of innovation.
I'm waiting For iPhone 15 Pro Max VS S23 Ultra 😊
Out of affordability still watching just to see pros and cons 😷
2:06 Dude u know that's the wrong way to hold the phone horizontally 😆
"Mega..." Me: mega what? "...pixel" Me: Fairs
I expected a more critical review from you....DISAPPOINTED.
SIR CAN YOU GIVE ME A PHONE PLZ.I HAVE A 2GB PHONE AND I CAN'T DO ANYTHING BY IT.I'M FROM SRI LANKA
Always a hype watching people changing their phones every year while my phone is growing with me :)
Comment 2,645 not the first comment
Me watching this video on a iPhone 8😢
Wow suprisingly nothing new
What about video 📸??
Picking up mine Friday and I can’t wait!!!
the wallpaper :D
woah too long video. maybe make it within 15mins?
I still prefer stainless steel look of iphone 14 pro max, and the sharp edges and the heavy weight. It feels expensive, cold and unwelcoming, very exclusive. If I want a light curved phone I'd get samsung😂 I'm slightly disappointed that iphone 15 pro max wont have that reflective finish at the side, slightly curved, hopefully not too light. Cos I'm getting it soon.
I really like the wallpaper used on the 15 pro max
hello bro from KOSOVA ❤️🇽🇰  i thing all these new things... android did it long ago... especially xiaomi huawei and others... 🤷
Its gone up by 200$😊😊
What a great reviewer you are. Subscribed. ✅
France banning these things due to radiation exposure to human body, Lol
Why I'm watching this video I imagine .  bcoz I can't afford one 🥲😂🍀
Waiting for s23 ultra comparison
The Sony Experia 1 Mark 5 leaves the iPhone 15 Pro biting the dust while playing games - including Resident Evil...
I just appreciated the titanium blue 🤩. It's really pretty!!!
Action button as shutter is totally what I wanted!
Mr was genuine when comes to tech report but nowadays he is leaning on iPhone I think
So ... really nothing new?
The new cable looks really good i always had problems with old cables not even 1 year and they are unable to use
Always a vibe watching people changing their phones every year while my poor phone is growing old with me 😊
Can we count how many times he said: "if we zoom out a bit"😭
Apple paycheck must be good
What about side loading apps?
I disagree, I think it is a failure in innovation, it will sell for sure due to Apple fan but unless your phone is 11, then you spend a lot of money to get very minimal upgrades
Can't belief you're talking about call quality in 2023
U turned into a fanboy  There is nothing new in this phone and evryone is talking about it You are going so easy on this  If it was samsung you'd say they were forced to put usb c and nothing new in the design like u did with the s23 and going extra hard on it like u always do You lost transparency with your videos
The design sizes are good but I still hate the camera bump and layout
damn, you came out guns blazing
Iphone is nothing but nothing is not an iphone
So nothing I will notice in everyday usage and still I will upgrade form my iPhone 14 pro for no reason 😅
long gone those days when arun used to be neutral. after the dull launch apple cashing on influencers. too bad for consumers. after the TV media now social media is also getting SOLD OUT.
Your review of the camera could not have been more spectacular. Really great attention to detail. Nice balance of the technical aspects, while keeping the focus on the user experience.  Great sample image tests too. Keep it up man!
Battery test next?
DAMN THAT APPLE PAYCHECK IS REALLY WORKING
Drop a like if you heard the "booooring" in the background.😅
legend has it that, Sheldon is still praying 😢 ...
Babe uncle arun just dropped come to the living area ❤
Paid review😂
Iphone15 pro - "sponsored version" Just kiddin
I'd always wonder how apple and their phones get away with doing something as stupid as an "action button" and youtubers and apple fans love it. This is ish I been able to do since 2008 and in 2023 this is new and innovating to apple fans
Can we get battery test and up against the s23u
I’m waiting for your gift
day 3 of asking for a free iphone 15
It's funny how all this YouTubers are trying extremely hard to make the case for the iPhone this year!!!   I do remember iPhones having noise cancelling on phone calls and they suddenly removed it.   Now USBC but you have to buy a different cable to get the faster speeds? Well that's eco friendly apple   All about apple this year is a joke!
so iPhone 15 pro max does not have any good upgrades so they came up with Aroon to explain photo-enhancing features for their business marketing.
Shutter button like Sony Xperia has?, now iPhone are coping Sony
If this isnt an apple promoted video Idk what is, everything you mentioned here was possible on android either built in or as an downloaded app or apk
Waiting for your review of Sony xperia 1 v
I’m so excited to get mine on launch day I knew although a bunch of people were complaining it was a smaller update that it wasn’t, I can’t wait to have the best phone out there when I get mine!
99.9 % of people will have phone covers so the going so much over fingerprints was waste of a video time.
Who was waiting for part 2?
the weird thing is you say that voice isolation came on the iphone 15 pro but i have an iphone Xr and my mom has an iPhone 11 and before ios 17 came out we had it and i always noticed it
Where can I find the wallpaper?
Didn’t this man just make a video switching over to android?
It's crazy how iPhone still selling phones that look almost the same as they did 8 years ago!!😮😮
This is too technical .... i think objectivly not better than the 14 but think most of it can be software done. Like gaming could work on 13 n 14 but they locked it
I hate the colors! I wish the deep red color that was rumored was better.
I dont think anybody uses their iphone without case so the flat edge or curved edge dont matter for most and i feel better grip on my silicone case for iphone 14
I just don't get why companies can't put CONTINOUS ZOOM with an ULTRAWIDE LENS.  and just replace the 3 Cameras by one single better camera  as say if it is 0.5x ultrawide and is able to continous zoom at 10x  that means you will be able to take 0.5x UW shots, normal shots at 1x (which will be 2x in this case) and upto 5x (10x in this case)  same quality in all the modes.  not to mention now they can increase lens size almost 3-4 times and even increase sensor size.  put a continous variable aperture on that and we can get the best camera system ever.  imagine night shots with a 3-4 times bigger lens.
The non-pro 15s seems like a more interesting upgrade over their predecessor😄
So basically the same thing
Every time the new phone comes out the older model becomes the wordt phone in the universe until the next version comes out then the previous "new" version takes the crown.
The single-thread Geekbench score is marginally faster than the i9-13900K (within runtime variance), so is only beaten by the 13900KS.
❤❤❤🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
I have a 13 pro max and I’m definitely upgrading
Auto portrait is already present in pixel, why don't you mention in video
People for some reason blame phone that don't have upgrades. The main reason as apple told is that, iphone release everyyear doesn't mean you should upgrade every year. If you're using iphone 14, iphone 15 will be a no brainer. But for someone who's dad is using an iphone 7 or 8, whose software upgrade just ended, A iphone 15 would be a great Christmas present. The problem, is it's only 200 days of difference considering bringing new changes and making them in a bulk and packking and shipping stuff. So i think all the phones are doing a agreat job. If phone companies wanted you to upgrade everyear like oneplus, it could give you a greenline simple. Why go through all the trouble giving 5 year OS update.
I can’t wait for my iPhone 15 Pro! It’s my first Pro! I’m updating from the 11. :)
All the updates are what a phone company can apply with a software upgrade but apple is apple so they release a new phone for these upgrades🤠
IM EARLY
My Pixel does Portrait in the edit, too. I thought was is normal.
That's a perfect paid video.... iPhone is boring now...not much innovation
but....          can it run CRYSIS?
All of these phone are trash I’m still using the 12 I refuse to upgrade because it won’t feel like an upgrade
Nice try MWTB..... the iphone 15 is an unconditional and uncontestable failure! But hey, people will buy it because of the society status it brings so... anyways.. let's wait for the Q4 sales stats and we'll see.
Hi sir how is your cat I have a cat the same as your own and it is cute and playful too I guess
Apple allway have made the best phones on the market. Samsung phones cant do as much
i know that u are a true apple fan lol so that u dont compare specially iphone 15 pro max to s 23 ultra
I will be keeping my 11 pro max as I still don’t see a significant reason for upgrade. 😊
Can we please get a link to the wallpaper in the thumbnail 🙏🏻
Explaining 😂😂 too much
the number of times arun said "48 megapixel" 😂
Why every tech YouTuber upload apple review vdo same time same day so in my pov all these are paid review 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 apple in fear
Review?? That’s crazy
What's the wallpaper in the thumbnail???
This is not a paid promotion 😬
I have a doubt…if there is someday an emergency and call recording of a call is being evaluated by the security services/police …won’t silencing the background noise will decrease the number of clues that they might get by listening to the recording…??  Or am I watching too many crime series
Unpopular opinion: If someone ever has bad blood with Arun, they would install a spring so strong to his chair, he will be shipped off instantly to outer space. Just look at the intensity with which he slaps his ass on the chair.
19:21  I think i phone 15 is a good phone with dumb ungrade 😒🥴🥴 I phone 13 pro max is the bast upgrade of all time in Apple History  😅
Console games coming to phone is news to me, this will open up a new world for mobile gaming.
bruh this is not 15 pro review. this is just 15 pro camera review
I finnally get a new released I phone
The difference between the 13and 14 was very less but theres a huge difference in iphone 15 which was very shocking❤
How do I get resident evil
He is definitely an iPhone sale's man
You can already use the action button to control home devices through shortcuts!
14:11 bro😆
wow
mrwhostheboss hair is disappearing 😢
Does playing those heavier games on it still force the display to dim from heat and then throttle the chip shortly after? Every prior iPhone throttles like this in heavy games
HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHA Brand new iphone HAHAHAHAHAHA this joke never gets old its has made me laugh since iphone 4S !
The AAA gaming feature is utterly useless. I have yet to see anyone who would play these games, that are built for a bigger screen, on the tiny phone screen. Reviewers nowadays are deadly scared of calling out a gimmick. Also, isn't HEIF available on Galaxy phones for a few generations now? Fake bokeh is also available in gallery apps on many brands. Why are these worth spending any time on!
I hate how whatever apple do this guy will clapp for them
1199 is 200 more than 999
ya but you can't buy...........
M539 !!!!
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN PAID BY APPLE, WE ARE NOT FOOLS TO LISTEN TO YOU AND BUY NEW VERSION....PEOPLE, THESE INFLUENCERS SUCK
As my first language is hindi I always prefer to watch tech videos in hindi but you are totally different it means i like your videos over hindi language speakers tech reviewer really loves your work ❤ as most of YouTuber give only positive points on unboxing videos and after 1 or 2 months of sale ends they upload video of negative points of mobile but you are presenting positive points with actual facts
I hate how whatever apple do this guy will clapp for them
Finnaly a proper full deep dive into the phone they only overtalk some features and leave the rest to waste
Is this a review or an advertisement for iPhone 15?
Ive had my Note 10+ since it came out in 2019. This is going to be my upgrade, very excited to see what an Iphone can do compared to a 4 year old samsung flagship haha
Imagine having to pay 1k for 120 Hz while my 2 yo 475€ and my mum's 2023 380€ phone have 120hz OLED displays
This year, whole family, even entire office; I can tell, Huawei Mate 60 or X5 only.
Can’t you send me an IPhone 15 to Sri Lanka?
apple make 1 solution and add 3 problem just what are they trying to do
Ayo Chill
iPhone 15 pro max vs S23 ultra
Battery drain test , please . Please
Okey. You convinced me 50%. Now let me go check Marques. 😁
You can use voice isolation on voice notes. Just lock the voice recognition to hands free mode and then open the control centre and turn it on once and it’ll be default for that app
the corners on the 11 (as on 8) are nice and round and also very slippery. especially if you don't have large hands, every new - and for that larger - phone is no more a single hand usable device. sharp corners are not comfortable as well. therefore i hope this "new" design is a good and grippy mix of rounded enough and not slippery.
Why show a lightning cave when talking about iPhone 15 Pro USB 3 speeds at 1:14? Odd shot choice 🤔
0:50 Arun is trying to become a professional unboxer.😂😂😂
I really want the pro max but on pink 😭👈😭
Early
For the first time, I watched your video before MKBHD. Big fan of your video style 👍🏽
I don't know a single person who would take a landscape photo with the camera down.
I don't think that console gaming on the phone will catch on. The screen is too small and you'd have to carry a controller around. The Steam Deck is a better solution.
Can your do the galaxy s23 ultra Vs iPhone 15 pro max ❤ from camera test and features and what takes the crown of the end of the year
Waiting for camera comparison S23U vs iPhone 15 pro max Love from Pakistan🇵🇰
I hate this phone
Alrighty let’s go!!
2468th comment (Dayum I missed by just 1 comment)
will these games come for 14 pro?
The problem with new smartphones for me now is that they are more camera comparisons than phone comparisons. The cameras have been more than good enough for me for a few years now, I feel like most of us would rather apple come out with a 1440p display like other phones as a main improvement. Tbf to them, I think there's only so much a phone manufacturer can improve now compared to 2007. Unless they come up with some groundbreaking redesign (not folding phones, they suck)
I don't blame Arun, he wants to go to next launch event.
Oh first hour using android samsung a30 by the way.😂😂😂
Is it me or is there something wrong with the lighting of the main set? It felt too bright and washed out for this particular camera angle at 0:30. Just wanted to point that out. As always amazing video, I really like how you approach your reviews!!!
How is HEIF a "shocking" advantage when many modern flagships already does that.
Do Iphones 15s  support LDAC, Aptx HD Audio HiRes Blutooth codecs  or we have to still rely on Androids for that?
👍👍
I don’t want an action button. I want a switch that gives me the possibility to mute my phone and check if my phone is muted without even pulling it out of my pocket
We have voice isolation on iPhone 14 Pro/PM.
Sorry, not convinced
Are the PlayStation games or Xbox games going to be compatible for the regular iPhone 15?
The Best iPhone ever made
I still see no reason to buy the new iphone
Heyyyyty
Lame iPhone upgrade. Over 1000 bucks for a camera button. My Galaxy Note 5 does that with a home button. Programmable home button for double click. Now my S23 Ultra does it with the power button. We already have action button now iSheeps thinks this upgrade is so cool
Wow that blue really shines vs how it showed up on the event launch day!
*wipes iPhone with cloth* iPhone : " AYO CHIL" 💀
Mr boss , i have been using Android my happiness would be 1/0 if i can get one latest iPhone. I know thats a lot but i can do comedy to compensate. The line is what did the cow in UK told to the ant on road in US . Mooooooooooveeeeee
Love u arun bro ❤️
Only good thing is now I can charge it with my Samsung charger.
I love your reviews but slightly disappointed with this one considering it sounded to me as if someone's trying really hard to project a product to the level of being biased.
Imagine having a phone for 3 years with Heif  codec and noticing on a weekly basis that window doesn't support it
Bro the phone is basicly the same as an iphone 12, you don't need to sell the phone lol
Still rocking S21 Ultra,stil my most  favourite design in a phone  yet.
I’m conflicted on who to watch first. You or MKBHD 😂😂😂
soo the camera is better everything else is the same...ayd not surprised
I want to see the 5x optical zoom battle between Xiaomi 13 Ultra and iPhone 15 Pro Max.
Better than I think? Not really.  The programmable button isn't something "gamechanging", it's just a cool little feature and it's the least Apple can do to add something to their new device. The "voice isolation" feature is already available on previous iPhone generations. Most people who own such expensive phones likely own a PC or a console, so I don't see why they'd want to play on their phone on lower settings and a much worse framerate when they could just use their gaming system. The USB-C port is the only "revolutionary feature", and it's only because Apple was forced to change to it. Whatever else mentioned in the video is just small tweaks that Apple does to every new phone. As expected, just another underwheming, lame upgrade.
Iphone 🤮
Again only camera  that's it that was the last straw I am switching to Andriod😢
You so rich gimme one 😂
Beautiful video. Most overhyped, over priced phone which have minimal changes from last years model. Only major change is USB C, that too was a forced one.
19:18 its because it is not true what you said earlier, both 14 pm and 15 pm with 256gb started at 1199
I just wish they would’ve made the 15 mini Pro Max 😢
every phone ever: better than you think
You should  do blind camera test and let viewers decide
Better 14 Max or 15 pro?
The last pro phones also came in a white box. I still have my box.
S23 ULTRA is still better, sadly.
As an example for RE Village that you used, sure the resolution is 720p, but I think you didn't mention the fact that the PPI is very important. You won't notice the fact that it is only 720p as the pixel density of the phone screen is massive. I did the math, on a 32 inch screen running at the 1600x900 the PS4 would run at, you'd have a pixel density of 57.37. Now for the Iphone pro max having a display size of 6.7 Inch, the PPI is 219.2! That's incredible... So it will look incredibly sharp on such a small display. For reference, a 4k image of 3840 x 2160 on a 32 inch display is still 137.68 PPI... Which is still less than the Iphone 15 pro running at 720p... absolutely wild...
I love the iPhone 15 Pro Max❤with its new set of cameras and New Ray Tracing with A17 Pro chip !This is mostly software magic done backend!Congrats to Apple on that
Literally it's the same clone with now USB c which Androids users are using for a decade now. For a mammoth price point like this, it's not worth it if you have a previous model.
So it's a bunch of software tweaks,  some of which were out on the HTC One, well over a decade ago, and the rest of the major "improvements" will get covered with a case so becomes a moot point.
As an influencer who buys every version of every type of phone, you would have to have both g innovation to impress you. As a normal consumer who gets a phone when he needs one, this is a huge upgrade.
Good one
One day they will remove the Apple stickers
S23 ultra vs 15 pro max, waiting boy
Only npcs have iphones
I have a Sony xperia with a dedicated camera button from 2011
BTW the HEIF image format is also available on Samsung phones if you enable it in settings. Same for the HEVC video format.
Finally someone talks about the gaming of the phone! Great vid!
Ass
HEIF als image format is also available on Android, but it's not activated by default since these files are not supported everywhere.
I need that background u used for the iPhone in the video...
Can it beat s23 ultra ?
We just got him back he cannot switch back to the iPhone
well man, after every review you literally leave me in a situation where I can't even think of a one other feat or spec that I'd be wanting to know 😅
but your a apple user
Ur an apple fanboi now more than ever .. never thought u would defend a company that didnt change a single major thing for 4 years .... ur failing me as my fav youtuber arun
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩 ❤
One thing I don't like about iPhones is that is can't download apk's. Unless they changed that.
3 videos in a week! Paradise
I have a 15 pro max it’s just epic it will last me a good 3 to 4 years I do also have the 14 plus which is very good I still use it because sadly my 15 pro max is broken but it will get fixed
Like how garbage must someone be to support a company that wants to force people to stick to their ecosystem
How did you get Resident evil village on the iPhone and how did you play with your controller?
Apple has arrived to the point now where the defining feature of the new iPhone is its color/finish... that says it all.🤪😝🤣 And none of the tech reviewers can call Apple out on its BS, because if they do, then Apple won’t invite them back next year, when the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s 6x “zoom” lens and revolutionary new gray finish is revealed 😂
Oh my God it's exactly the same as the old one that's mind blowing 💀💀💀
Meanwhile on android people are already playing games up till PS3 and Nintendo Switch.   Emulation power on 23U is like nothing else.  But do not have much high hopes from 24U from the rumours I heard.  4nm processor, no increase in battery size, ditching the curved screen, etc.  Anyways I wasn't gonna upgrade, but we will have to wait and see.  might get an iPhone after Vision Pro launch, if it is any good.
Watching youtubers talk about tech, new phone without planning to buy it is my tradition 😅
I think I’m late 😢
Hilariously sad to see apple trying to make a big thing out of so small and irrelevant things. Like their phones, but they lost their momentum.
Solid review
Samsung fans: omg there’s no difference with the iphone 14 and 15!!1!
I don't know why I'm excited 😂 knowing that I can't afford it.
When I’m want something this my channel to know what I want
Just give me a Derek Zoolander, for god sake!
Only USB
Where can I get that wallpaper in the thumbnail?! I need it on another level 😩 lol
same marketing bs year after year...
That wallpaper is niiiice where can you get it from?
Hi  Mrwhosetheboss can i please have a iphone for my birthday
I WANT TO BUY IT
Of course it's good. It's the same shit Apple keeps releasing for all their fans to sniff
This to me marks the moment that the days to upgrade every few years are well and truly over
A VERY cool mobile Game is mindustry. Just try it!
I watched 4 min and stopped.....I wont spend 19 min of a guy trying his very best to convince people with a 14 pro max to switch to the same phone with a usb-c....
you are paid promotor.
I saw what you did there when you said "pretty"  6:59
SRY ARIN. I could feel the stretch in this one. Not your fault
bruh
why does your video look washed out?
Samsung has that fucking vc thingy from 2021
Is this only in 15 pro ? And pro max
17:53 holy shit..75 pounds for a 1m charging cable?!?!
What cable would you recommend for fast charging?
What an insightful review! I’m using the normal 14 and I’m discovering fun things with ios17! This is why I always buy iPhones. The value of my purchase extends 5 years minimum! Knowing that I’ll get those new software features 3 years down the line is the strength of Apple, besides the great ecosystem. iOS 17 is really slick. It’s not just the outcome of the features, it’s how they implemented the features, the way you configure them and the way it makes you smile the first few times you tinker with it. Apple is a master of creating seamless uncomplicated experiences. I’m tech savvy enough to figure things out, but man, when somebody makes things so effortless and frictionless, it really puts a smile on your face!
Meanwhile, in Australia, the price increased on all models!
Your video's used to informative and interesting, but this one feels like an "Apple promoted video
Bro succin apple dik so hard 😂😂😂
❤ do giveaway but am very far from you... all the way from Nigeria
please do a camera test to compare the minimum focus distance of the main camera
Youtubers are paid to make iPhone looks good... sad but true
MEH.
yo
Don’t waste your time, make a video when the IPhone 99 comes out
Nowadays, it's tough to tell these cellphones apart based just on their hardware. Hardware is losing ground in favor of software in the conflict.
I love watching these videos knowing that im stuck with my broken iphone11 for the next idk how many years
Some issues are just YouTuber issues and not the general public
Most of the features in iPhone 15 pro max were present before in Android like voice isolation that is straight up copy of call clearing feature of google
Staying with my iPhone 13 Pro I think 😅
How much ram in this 😢
Me tryna view this video,  Peta: look at how this elephant is suffering in a circus  Me: we're finna make a new iphone, could we borrow some elephants and turtles while ur at it
Arun we’d all love to see a comparison of 13 Pro to 15 pro
Feels like s23 ultra will still be the king 🤷
The voice isolation is muffling the voice though.
Apple is clueless first time ever
Excessively good.
apple fan boys sucking the company off even more lol
Very helpful review bro, thanks
Now choosing between S23 Ultra and 15 Pro is even harder for me :/
1 hour late :(
S23 ultra vs 15 pro max
as an android user the ONLY thing I'm actually jealous of is the PS4 game ports; I really hope this comes to android soon high end phones DO have the power.
voice iso was here for years,no hate tho!
Thank you, we want something to do with that power!
youtubers and double standard hypocrisy.What is so special about the so called action button? Isn't this same button Samsung brought as Bixby 7yrs ago that was demonized,every rubbish brought by apple is a leap in tecchonlogy but others brands can go to hell?
So nobody was gonna tell me “back-tap” is on every iPhone??? Loved the review Arun!!
hahaha...the satisfaction when you said MEGA......PIXEL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IPHONE 15 - 48 Megapixel Camera vs. my old phone for 200$ also with a 48 Megapixel Camera, find the mistake...
who take  a picture with camera side on the bottom?  this is just pure copium.
Is there way to download raw images from iPhone 15 pro ?😊
So basicaly no new features and again taxing europeans for 300 bucks more lmao what a joke of a phone
Great review but just wanted to note that Voice Isolation was already there iOS 16.
Nothing great about the camera, you pumped it up.
Compare with s23ultra
IPhone 15 pro vs samsung s23 ultra camera comparison when will it come❤
With USB-C they had to to it to sell it in the EU.. not because they wanted usb-c 🫣 dont forget this point ^^
Why is everyone so dissapointed in the new Iphone 15 models. I loved them the second i saw them, even though i own the 14 Pro Max. I will order the new Iphone 15 Pro Max in Blue und the new Iphone 15 Plus in yellow. I love the new colours and phones :)
The programmable button can now act as a shutter and launch camera. Android parity, years later.
Why am I even watching this, i have never had an iPhone in my life!
isn't titanium extremely flammable so you could use a knife to scrape the side to make some fire starter
Let me crab some peanuts..I really  love your reviews
So what is your losses with HEIF and jpeg ? Clearly there is a catch.  What do you beifit from that?
Would be very glad to see  a comparison between the Galaxy s23 ultra and the iphone 15 pro max 😊
Why me a teen  watching this its just so fun 😅
Just turn the tap off😂
Curious about Resident evil's file size and approximate battery life while gaming!
Is there any sensible upgrade in Iphone 15, I don't think so!
I just don't understand, why whould anyone want to play PC games on an iPhone rather than PC or TV... It's just so much worse experience xd
6:13 That's so nostalgic😢. I bought it 8 years ago and I am still playing it every few months.
How are the thermals playing Resident Evil?
Very Very outdated Nothing special
Still not switching iPhone is too boring
Not getting a cable with the highest charging capability is not a standard. Most brands provide chargers and cables.
Apple fan boy as usual 😂
Well the pro max is for bigger people , my big hand can easily access the shortcut button but other than that accurate !
with the new pros you can plug into a tv and use the iPhone as a mobile console so you can play your console games on your tv with a controller.
Bro is getting paid by apple to make people buy it, bro it’s the same as 14
Compare it with s23 ultra
I love how you’re using Milo as a phone stand 😂
How did u get the phone?
Boss, we need Samsung S23 ultra VS Apple iphone 15 pro max
This makes my iPhone 13 mini look old!  (Hope I get one iPhone 15 in some months)
Yeah, at the very least the Pro Max didn’t go up in price, it just starts higher than previously because they removed the 128gb option, but the 256gb base is still priced the same as last year
The real difference is the IPhone 15 has an extra camera lenses.
I loved the part where he pulled out samsung s23 ultra 😊 Proud moment for samsung users🎉
Is he wearing Nail Paint!?
I feel like you really had to dig deep for this release so they give you the iphone. lol
Relationship goals!  Having your better half be completely interested and invested in your life is the best!
Apple will introduce faster charging speed in iPhone 16pros!! I can literally predict their next move as regards to that.  Watch and see!! Lol 😅
Still not really impressed. I sold my iPhone 14 PM because I got bored and the Samsung S23 Ultra blew me away. I currently have the Galaxy S23 Ultra, and I guess I'll wait for the Galaxy S24 Ultra.
Oh no, not the mega.. pixel 😢😢
Can someone please help find a link to download the wallpaper shown @ 4:10?
Voice isolation is in my xsmax also😅
Bro everything ur excited about I have better on my goated s23 ultra!!! SAMSUNG IS THE GOAT
Can I have the pro max please seeing as you probably get so many models to demo/film 😬😂🤷🏽‍♂️
Wait till Apple makes a Console! 😭
These days its difficult to spot a difference between these smartphones hardware wise. The battle is becoming more of software one than hardware 🔥
Gyaaatttttt
Can i ask you please for raw images to download? 😊😅 sorry for my bad english.😅
Apple invested youtubers 😂😂😂
Wallpaper
Bro can you gift me your old iphone  😮 😅😅 ❤
best review so far
Why did everyone post at the same time 😂😂
Wallpaper
It's just a phone  we are so materialistic
To be honest your review seems like Apple event. Nothing new to show😅😂😂
that camera focusing after you took the picture was on my LG G3 iphone just perfected it RIP LG A LEGEND !!
4:12 WYSI
Love the title. Alternate version: "Less mediocre and boring than expected!" It's funny how many of these features are lifted from the p7pro. Of course, the p7pro doesn't have Apple silicon (tensor is more unrealized potential as yet) and if you're locked in Tim's ecosystem these are really your only options. For what most people do, there's no compelling need to upgrade unless your phone is really old or you really really want to change all your accessories
This natural titanium looks so grey I almost regret ordering the black one.
At 18:27 you mis-calculated by saying the price was raised by $100 for the pro max when it is  raised by $200.  $999 + $100 is 1099, the pro max costs $1199.
You made me to want one these magical phones!!
hi          0:01
So many compromises still, and the prices keeps going up. It speaks to the mentality of the flagship phones buyers ...so sad.
2:38 maybe apple should see button sony xperia hihihihi
Voice isolation already exists to most iphones ..
Yukkk, OMG USB C. Lamest new feature ever
What an amazing review!! Now one else does it like you. Whenever I need a tech update, or I am deciding what phone to buy, I turn to you.
Not interested for this phone no any changes no surprises only 1 change type c Cable 🥱
E
Always a vibe watching people changing their phones every year while my phone is growing with me
Nice review Arun. Very detailed - showcasing everything that's new.
Stop Charging your battery wirelessly it will last
The new iPhones are so boring that even Arun can't find points to justify his favourite brand😭
Thank you for the video. I was waiting. Hello from Ukraine
Ждем тест батареи 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
WALLPAPER PLS
The pro max price didn’t really increase if you consider the starting capacity is higher. They basically just dropped the cheaper 128 Gb version from the lineup.
The singlecore score in geekbench6 is truly awesome, it's even higher than my just bought 7800x3d
Im still happy with my iPhone 12 mini😊
The fact that you can play ps4 games on this is kinda wild
When will the iPhone get in display finger unlock like Other Higher end Android devices
Wow apple really made a big jump. I'd might actually buy it only because of the resident evil games
Voice isolation work before on Discord calls
Wait... APPLE NOW SELLS CHARGERS WITH THE PHONE/!??!?!?!??!?!??!?! NAH JIT THAT'S THE BIGGEST UPGRADE EVER
Natural Titanium 15 Pro Max coming Friday. This video does an exceptional job of providing expectations. Mrwhosetheboss does it the best.
Not worth upgrading to. Mobile gaming peaked back in 2013 and has been going downhill since. Assassins Creed isn’t changing anything.
Damn, didn’t think someone would dethrone MKBHD for best tech YouTuber.  I guess you are the boss! Kudos.
Gave you a dislike just for that title
Can you give me an old Iphone you are not using🙂
What do you use to charge the phone ?  Where do you plug it?  Is there no cube to use in a wall socket?
HEIF format is available in most Android phones, all you gotta do is go to settings and turn of HEIF which will allow you to save more storage and gives good quality images just like this new iphone. Ig you missed that part i don't know whether s23 u has that HEIF  converter option but my phone does!
Thumbnail 😂
You forgot the other thing you get when you order a pro max - an email saying it will be delivered in November!
Man that HDR is really impressive, it's not the best available but the difference with last gen is so apparent, finally Apple fixing their weaknesses
Arun is getting biased towards apple
From what I remember, triple tap power button is limited to accessibility settings only. You can't map it to shortcuts or any utility features.
When your an isheep lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
As an android I see iPhone as a hype phone.. Can wait to see the Samsung galaxy 24 ultra 😊
same shit + a usbc 2.1 XD
Greate vid
Video is still very interesting, even tho I don't have an IPhone 🙂
Voice isolation is in 14 pro also
Soo a iphone 14?
Good video to say that the iPhone 15, except the Pro Max, have slower USB-C transfer speeds, 60 hz display, and software updates that can be done in any other Iphone... 😅
Fun Fact:- This video is secretly Sponsored by apple
you are excited,  I can see
I'll be honest I absolutely dislike voice notes. they're like calls while you're on the toilet
I remember being impressed by Nvidia shield android devices with Tegra CPUs to run Half-Life 2.
most overrated piece of tech on earth
Bro convinced me(android user) to switch to iphone 15 pro
17:26 That impressed me lol 😂😅
Still no charger in the box
pc/console games arent new thing, it was attempted in 2015~17 with alien isolation, grid autosport and couple more. It never took off
Some clips of this video looks washed out
Humanity is still unsatisfied 😢
iPhone 15 is king!!!
The Thumbnail 👌
Imagine buying almost the exact same phone but more exoensive
Glad to know google still has better photo processing 😂
Thumb(cocc)nail
I don’t tell a difference at all with the cameras
Here we go.
Conclusion: iPhone, it's almost as good as Android!
But... can it run Genshin on 120hz for more then 3 seconds?
The amount of ads on  this vid  is crazy
Im ready for iphone 15 pro max 1TB 🎉
That blue so pretty man
Overrated peice of titanium
wait?! You are a voice note guy? wth I thought you were a productivity guy
And this video is not sponsored?
Lol Sony has an action button since ages
Even so, it doesn't feel a good value for money outside of US.
nice video your video was uploaded at the same time as marques, is it planned? or a request from apple that you can publish the review at a specified time?
7:51  bro wtf💀
Samsung galaxy❤❤
Just on time for my lunch time entertainment
That is so cool
We know all that you are also on apple payroll like marques😅, but hey your videos are really good informative,👌 marques did only unboxing.🤷 Btw you must be dead brain to buy apple usbc cable for 75£ 😂
Where is your customary "it is the same phone as last year" when you reviewed a galaxy? Well, I guess when you see money...I guess you have to make a living too.
Based
So soon, I can play console Warzone on my iPhone again person wey dey use windows. Mad.
You reviewers should stop glorifying Apple for NO innovation whatsoever.Technically this is iPhone 14pro without usb c and action button
Ughhhh! How much did they pay you
The position of that bottom. Its the worst possible position for taking photos.
Believe it or not, Iphone 5s was THE BEST in every regard ( as per the standards of those times ,circa 2013 ) . ❤ I still have one. 😊
Iphone been better always then samsung    Plan to switch next year to see when prices lower
This is the first video I’m watching on my iPhone 14 pro, oh the irony 😂
i swear this iPhone has almost no difference to iPhone 14 pro max
322k views in 1 hour 😅
Hey Arun, just wanted to say that your videos are very soothing to watch. I enjoy each and every video you post and it's just a relaxing experience!!! Thanks for all the hardwork you do !!❤
The sponsors have gotten tired of the criticism
when is the comparisons? i wanna buy and i dont want to buy and then see your video and it shows something i regret.
Sometimes i thought 3x is way too high, now 5x is indigestible
Pure bias, sorry.
I like  it😊❤
Omg WOW a buttttton? I cannot believe we’re at the point of having entire deep dives on… a button….
.
Xiaomi 13 ultra camera way better
The way it switches between cameras so smooth with 0 lag though.
Hi I’m you Biggest fan and I love your Videos
By the way if you notice it says 256 gigabytes,so the price is the same,you are just being forced to get more Storage on the iPhone 15 pro max
Lovely video bro, you just sold the phone to me
I do a bit same when it comes to clicking photos... I actually take 4 5 different images with different exposure and frame (and mode too)...
Mrwhosetheapplefangirl
just like an andriod phone.
This pop up on my for u page
The exact same thing lol
18:49 Difference btn $999 and $1199 is actually $200 and not $100
Watching while eating 🍿
Iphone 15 PM > S23 Ultra
In Canada, the 15 Pro Max has a $200 CAD price increase over the 14 Pro Max, from $1549 CAD to $1749 CAD, so it's actually so much worse 😃
Wow it's a new camera....with a port that's already been out for android
Just the same. Little improvement.
Who else preordered the pro max?
U look stressed why 🥲
Slow Charging is Biggest Con in IPhone
I aint buying a new phone until they remove the fken notches
Action button to shutter is pointless. You can shutter with volume button since ages.
Its my dinner time and you serve me this. Delicious ❤
If it's better then why are other videos saying not to buy it yet lolz?
Aren't you the just biggest Apple fan on youtube
The best in the market
Voice isolation is not a new feature though
3:25 nothing new about that
Waiting for the S23 Ultra vs 15 PM camera comparison, gonna be good!
So USB C, which all others have for ages, is the biggest change. Anyhow, you are a good seller :)
Such a boring phone
I just updated ios17!!
"7 telephoto lens" definitely a lie and misleading marketing. They could have introduced the 5x telephoto lens and bigger sensor in a honest way without exaggerating about digitatly cropped telephoto lens. Apple just being Apple!
Looks just like an iPhone 11 from 2019, oh wait it is
Even tho I'm team android, I just love the screen of the iPhone. Its just so smooth for some reason.
voice isolation have been around for a few years now!
Paid video clearly! Why trying to sell this outdated phone ?
7:51 bro cought me off guard  😂😂
For safety reasons, you should probably blurr the part where you show your finger print on the phone.
Watching this after school ended😂
Proper upload sync with Marques 😅 Guess I’ll be watching both vids now
It’s that time of the year where you try to sell same trash.
We need timestamps 😊
That's why the iPhone is so far behind in terms of innovation. Thanks to people like you, who celebrate something that deep inside you, deep in your heart, you know sucks. Doing that will only make the creators think they are going in the right direction. It's sad to say, but until most of you bias-blind fans stop acting that way, you're going to be stuck with a phone that dates back to 2012. The only reason Android has come this far in terms of innovation and operating systems is because every time something sucks, people do not hesitate to express themselves with the truth. Went from Iphone 14 to Fold 5 and all i have to say -->> oh god i was stuck<---
noice
I often think if I were Canon or Nikon, that Apple releasing a camera body with all their computational photography and chip expertise would keep me up at night.
For now, i'll wait for the comparison between the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra vs iPhone 15 Pro Max.
voice isolation not new S phone already have focus mood
I’m waiting for your battery life test 😊
Dude stop bringing this girl to ur every vdos... U don't need to...
Dude I’ve been waiting too impatiently
☹️i too wish to have an iPhone
Are people going case less now?
2:54 this man has gotten just about every person watching his video to start violently tapping the back of their phone in complete vain. Love him😂
Please do camera comparison.😢😢😢😢😢
No one like same thing every year….
Do a radiation test against android phone's ...bet you iPhone will lose ....look after your health people...
Next lvl of shit 🤣😂
Finally someone who isnt only looking at the apple bad things
USB 2.0 is STANDARD for most of phones. In what year the fuck are you living in? lol
15 Pro or S23 Ultra?
Paid review…
Ong ❤
I like the irony that the line 'better than you think' was used by Marquez Brownlee for S23 Ultra. I find MB to be too biased towards Apple whereas MWTB seems to be able to stay neutral in assessment.
WHERE did u get that PS5 faceplate??😮
Apple’s ability is to get people obsessed and love their brand.
Happy with Samsung j 2 core ❤
Side by Side comparison of 15 Pro Max vs S23 Ultra with Marques would be really nice. Great video as always!!!!!!!
I honestly do not think that this is a objective review (even though now its the no review time I still think its not honest)
Paid promotion…
Didn’t it just come out how have u used it “for a while now”
Engineers are so smart over at Apple LOL. They made stronger the only part of iPhone that never breaks LOL. Fantastic an immediate buy
I love looking at things I can't afford 😭
Battery test 🎉
Better buy a S23 ultra then this,100x better then ipop 15😅
Have the changes to the frame made the pro max feel less HUGE? I don’t know if I want a tablet for 2 years. Thinking of going from 11 pro max to 15 pro. But don’t wanna regret it!
It's always fun to watch phone reviews knowing I'll never going to have one of these
Pretty good, I'm still going to use my old ass android tho lol
How much you get for the promotion video 😂
You can use all the FaceTime and noise icatuon features on other iPhones it’s not just for the iPhone 15s it’s just an iOS 17 update
1.9kenthtedndth
95 percent can't even afford it, people will surely use cases on pros.... Though really liked the design jump animation.
Much lighter 1gramm wow realy worth mention.
Thumb down for that "mega... Pixel" joke, good video otherwise
near 17M subs 😌👌
1:11 do you have any recommendations for cables to fast charge the 15 pro max?
Again,I Can't Buy It But Still watch this video 😂
I remembered Assassin's creed on PSP looking much better.
you and mkbhd uploaded at the same time lol!
Question. Is white paper more eco than black? I would think the paper shouldn’t need more bleeching before inking?
Want a comparison between pixel 8 pro and iPhone 15 pro
Sim ejectors?!??!
those days when reviews where honest 😢
What is that wallpaper called???
That’s why MKHD is the best he doesn’t kiss up he keeps it real this guy just want another Apple invite
For me the squared phones are more nice to hold
this video like shine apple balls
should I upgrade from 14 pro max
Iphone 15....BORING....I think I will buy the fold 5.
Me who can’t afford 😅
I seriously can’t wait for the battery test. Arun definitely ain’t gettin sleep for that😮‍💨🤣
They are the same every year no new innovation from a pretty corrupt company
I have a question about gaming. Given that Apple is designing all the chips in house, won't porting games for MacOS, iOS & iPadOS be one and the same thing? The incentive for a game developer to develop for the three platforms combined (mostly the high paying consumer group of the iPad) should push the industry towards AAA games being brought to the iPhone, I hope. Do you think that's a plausible argument?
I am SO hyped about the lowlight photos in the 15 Pro. My DSLR sucks in low-light and I have an 11 Pro which captures more stars but is super grainy. My DSLR is super smooth but captures barely any stars. The 15 Pro looks like it could be my lowlight camera as well as my phone! Wahoooooooo
Those who plays pc games in phone 😂😂😂 bro get a life or a good pc i guess
Its crazy to think that the Samsung S23 Ultra can match it in GPU performance Qualcomm did something crazy with the adreno 740👌
I’d kind of like more honest reviews of these things. Pretty much everyone agrees the improvement to last years models is near nonexistent.
Guys help decide what I should get 15 pro max or s23 ultra
What is the screensaver you used?
The glare on your face is very weird. The rest of the video is genuinely visually stunning, though
A17pro is for sure faster than base ps4 (that has less than 2 terflops)
But… we already had voice isolation.
Apple freak...
;)
Nice thumbnail btw ❤
Lol I'm gonna buy it but I'm glad I never bought last year model I wait 4 to 5 yrs to buy a next phone u can't be stupid when it comes to trend vs practicality
Finally, been waiting for this Arun
Titanium Blue looks like a Deep Purple from IPhone 14 series
Yay can’t wait to wait until 9th October to get mine because the pre orders were bugged to high hell
Landscape mode should place the cameras at the top, not the bottom. Using this simple "contortion" to prove the action button is of some use, is shall I say, "twisted"? Stop it! You are an engaging content creator, but stop treating your viewers as subjects to be manipulated.
Hey Arun, why are there so many fade out transitions between scenes?
"ayo chill"💀💀☠
Just one thing I have s21+ and had HEIF photos for a while. It's not new  If not for not being able to download torrents I would love to try iphone for a change, but there's too many foreign series unavailable on streaming services for me to do it.
Bro is throat goating apple 😅
It's time for the biggest war S23 ultra vs 15 pro max 👽🔥👽🔥👽
Same fking thing every year
i dont care if camera take 1 sec to click 1 pic or 5 pics in 1 sec as long as its focused clear shot. click speed of camera doesn't matter at all.
You took a motion photo in the S23 Ultra but live photo on iPhone looks like it was turned off
Nothing impressive really,every year they make it seem like iphone is all that, pixel 8 is the killer now. No 🧢
Voice Isolation has been in IOS 16. Not sure why this is featured now.
This is the best video I’ve seen for the iPhone 15 Pros, and I’ve watched a lot of them in the last week…
i honestly feel apple paid arun for this video. smart played arun
I have never used an Apple phone been Android through and through. I was seriously considering purchasing this device. However 3 minute's in and I'm already saying no. Fancy having the camera on the bottom in landscape mode that is absolute ridiculousness. Not well thought out at all. They see people coming, they know they can bring any old crap out now and people will buy it. Sad really.
looked impressed.but whatever i am an android lover.📱
Trash as every other iphone is
Larger photos but the base storage hasn't gone up , you pay money for a phone that has rubbish storage The battery hasn't increased and no innovation as it does not have fast charging, reverse charging
you so oily.
At home sick and the first YouTube video I get recommended an absolute banger
All that i understood is blah blah blah USB C blah blah blah..
6:48 transition was siiiickkkkkk bro
Lol action button to take pics will cause shaking
So this is an iPhone 14 pro with Software updates. Oh and type-c !
Bro. Your skin is oily.  And your shinny forehead is catching more attention than your content.  Hope u take it positively & improve it.
14:12 😂😂😂😂roasted 😂
literally any other phone including iphones: double tap power button to open camera, press volume up button to click the picture. In samsung this double tap to open camera is even programmable as well.
Daddy
LMAO THAT AYO CHILL PART GOT ME
why everyone not telling about the cinematic mode(pro series)?!  i have seen a video of pro series that pro series cinematic mode has only 2x max optical zoom.. wheather it has 5x optical zoom in 15 pro series 👀
Ah the way we all play our games!! Hunched down on all fours up against a rock with the screen half covered in grass!!😂
Gift me one😂
This entire week YouTube will be flooded with iPhone 15 unboxing videos and this video is one among those.
Still can't afford 😢
Day 3 of asking Mrwhosetheboss for a iphone 15
The only thing I would say is most of the video was spent on the camera… which was informative but honestly this years iPhone is meh
Best review yet
The features like heif, adding potrait and remastering the pic are already in samsung 😂😂
Rickroll: 8:22 You’re welcome!
How many people are watching like me who can't afford
Is your fiance single
🃏And 🖐️here 🖐️we🖐️ go...
I have not seen any youtuber as this level of quality editing....Hates off to Mrwhostheboss..
Just buy S23 ultra, you will get much more than on 15 pro max, believe me
Honestly, i have a regular iPhone 11, and many people won’t upgrade to a new iPhone every year, pretty much all my family has either the 11 or 12, so even if the iPhone 15 has all these wonderful features, I don’t think many people want or can afford the new iPhone. Which has been a thing since a while ago.  Some people will probably buy the 15 when the 16 or 17 comes out. Great vid though! 👍🏼
idk what he missed at least half of these are bundled in last years pixel 7
Women☕
Mega......pixel 😆
Bro, I could marry 2 wives by the price of new iPhone 💀
If even you review iphone 14 and say that it is iPhone 15, we wouldn't notice lol 😂
Erm.. Samsung can store image in HEIC format
Waiting for the ultimate battery test❤
How you Guys got Your phones to early..? i have got delivery date from 26 to 30 in store, pickup was not available as i  got into preorder screen 25 min later
6:20 about gaming not sure because iphone is pretty much weak for handle games in a long time cuz of heat it will over heat like hell then you we lose 5-10 percent of battery health which i experienced it on carXstreet before also the heat issue is not only in game also when im using safari specially with cellular it want to explode
The talk on 3x 5x optical zoom, and why it's not good, is when I swayed away from consciousness. Great review jokes aside.  Why do you look so pale though ? 🤔
Arun is not pregnant but he not fails to deliver everytime 😅😅
Hold up @5:00 Why. are. you. playing. on. a .mobile. out. in. the. garden. in. that. posture..?
That crawling towards the action button ☠️
Waiting for your Samsung vs Apple video....
❤❤
Same old 💩
Buddy idk but I felt some difference in the color grade in the shots where u actually show outdoor things vs you yourself in yo room, felt faded.
need to see the battery vid asap
Nah, still not good enough to make me upgrade from 13 pro
Unfortunately you've become an iPhone biased YouTuber, one of THE ONLY reasons people loved to watch your contents was because you were unbiased and honest about tech, now you just want iPhone to look better than other phones, i hope you realize it and think about it
So they stole the Bixby button now....iAnything sucks!
Can you use action button for multiple commands like silent as well as torch or something else?
RIP to those who bought 14 pro max in the recent past. (One of my ex did lol)
Arun has become a apple sheep....most of theses update are to software.
This is a masterpiece.
I hv the 13 and will wait for the 18 pro max
Waiting for S23 Ultra vs 15 Pro Max
Can i upgrade from my iphone 14 pro max to this iPhone 15 series Is that worth it?
Me watching these Youtubers UPGRADING their phone every year while my phone ages with me.
If you plug in a power bank to the iPhone 15 how does it know to get charge or put out charge?
0:59 bro is trying to be the relaxing end
I‘m not even sure nowadays what gets me more exited .. the new IPhones themselves .. or the magnificent videos about the IPhones and everything else of these awesome creators like Mrwhosetheboss or MKBHD ..  Every time there is a new video my day instantly gets better .. thx so much for the incredible work you’re doing ..
Does anyone think that his forehead has gotten bigger??
Please can you do a comparison between the macbook pro and the macbook air? I need a new computer but I'm not techy enough to understand which one is best for me.
Voice isolation 😂copied from Samsung
$999 + $100 = $1199.....🤔
"couple of apple stickers" When it gives you just one.
My opinion: Mrwhoosetheboss > MKBHD 😬
गज़ब भाई क्या बोलते हो👌👌
If you say something nasty against the iPhone 15 do you get invaded by the apple swat team with Tim Cook calling the shots
I can find the phone case or where you talked about it.
s22 ultra saves the photos as HEIF and also can add portrait after taking the picture, even with pictures that you didn't even took
2:25 Samsung phones can do that too. In the camera app you can save the last chosen shooting mode and open with a double tap on power button for a quick shot. I often use it on my Galaxy and it's really useful.
Can u please do a comparison between s 23 ultra and 15 pro Max
The main question is why aren’t these camera features on the 14 pro too?!
Last gen consoles definitely support HDR MrWhoseTheBoss lol
I make fire songs , just listen🔥🔥🔥
Nice wallpaper. From where I can download it ?
This was a bit of a reach in my opinion
Does he do a battery life comparison ?
guys, production team, the transfer rate is limited to usb 2.0  !!
You should do a video with call me shazam 😅
I Wil get mine 22 september 🎉can't wait
it’s really not out of reach if you hold your phone in the left hand and only use both hands while typing. in the left hand you can use your thumb for the action button and your index or middle finger for the power button.
I got a iPhone XR right now but want to upgrade to a 14 or 15 pro anyone got any advice ?
Hmm...
And I will not be upgrading I find myself using my Samsung more than my 14pro max crazy
Waiting for S23 ultra vs iPhone 15 pro maxx
The only thing I have taken away from this video is that this man has a fiancee and is somehow not actually gay
early gang ⬇⬇⬇
Nice camera review  Will buy the dslr half the proce this for sure👍
first time i disliked one of ur videos.. this feels such a paid review (idk if it paid or not, and that is frightening itself coz it feels like it). and no, i am not an android fanboy. but i really thought u would be honest about the new iphone
Gonna wait years in order to have thisnhaha
What's the use when you don't have the money to buy it.
This is a super thumbnail Arun Love it ❤
I got a question... Which smartphone is the best budget smartphone of 2023? (a smartphone with decent specs)
iphone = 5x zoom samsung = 100x zoom
انشاء الله اجيبه كل سنه بينزل فيها ايفون اقول كده ومجبتش لسه😂😂 بس ده فعلا الايفون البرو المثالي❤
an apple fantard EXAGGERATELY reviewing the "SAMEphone" 15 🤑🤑🤑
Nice to see that my 13 Pro Max has "insanely good battery" (16:25). I'll keep it for a 2nd year, then get the 15 Pro Max when it's half price, when the 16s come out next year 👍😮😉.
One thing to add on the IPad Air 4th gen the voice isolation already existed there but im unsure of the other IPhones etc.
Pls stop the cringe word play some time you just have to stop it was cool back in the days but now it sounds stupid and also you just try to make any work
You are the best....
All the best for your small and big success in your future.
Who’s watching this video on 14 pro max😂
It's nice.... Still can't affords it, gonna have to stay with android qwq
Am I the only one for whom the video kept blinking. So jarring
Voice isolation is literally on any iPhone running iOS 17 lol
Is 5:11 cloud streaming?
Wallpaper link please????
Why iPhone 15 is better according to Arun (probably Apple) 1. It's got better Cable 2. Camera opens faster 3. Wow, I can talk to my partner without background noise. 4. The iPhone which costs more than a console can play games somewhat like a console although it doesn't have many to begin with. 5. Woah, design is good (smol bezels) 6. Can click photos phast🎉 7. Battery is better because Trust me bro, Tim Cook told me so...
I’ll stay with my 14 pro max that’s the same like 15 pro max !😅
As a android user, i would be happy to try the new iphones since i haven't used or used one.  But since i can't afford the iphone 15 seris, i might try an iphone 11 or 12 to get used to ios 😊
10:12 oh I don’t think that also includes the Live Photo data.. live is stored as other storage and not photos .. try transferring the Live Photo to windows and check the size
The PS4 supports HDR rendering.
Though I know I can't afford it right now but still I am enjoying Arun's video.
I miss the days when Arun would just sit down and talk about the phone... too much editing takes away the charm 😔
M539 music @ 8:55 🎉
voice isolation feature is there in my 14 pro max.
Play geomtry dasg hehe
I will see you in the comparison....me ultra all the way
What 0:25🐶🐶
But anyways peoplle gonna take phone cover protection cause its 1500 dollar
Your production is wild! I need to talk to the editor for tips!
How is the voice isolation a ‘iPhone 15 feature’? It is not even an iOS 17 feature! On my iOS 16 Xs Max, I’m using that feature intensively for a year now!
I waited for the notch to go away and the usb-c to come, they have now. This year might be the one I take a bite of the Apple! I'll wait for your battery review first though.  And well done, Arun!!
I really like your content. Thank you!❤❤❤
999 to 1199 is 200$ difference right? 🤔
@Mrwhosetheboss (Arun) at 6:25 mins in the video you said how easy it is to get on android but thinking from a game developer companies perspective, iphone and macs both will get the same game making it more viable option for developer to transport the game to iphone and macs because as they would have the same base architecture of the chip so it would be a win win situation for apple and game developers both as both the devices would get support for games; it could be apples master plan as it would be changing people perspective from apple being a company known for only competitive in only specific task like video editing and programing to general use devices for all types of users. Would love to know what you think about it.
How much did apple paid you to do this
watching this on my iphone 11 :’)
iphone 15 $999 and 15 pro max going up by 100 to $1199 it's not $100 it's $200  by the way great video as always
Do these things or most of the things same with iphone 15? Pls do let me know
Mega...... pixel 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 16:11
I’m quite interested in seeing the AAA games they have in mind for it. While I’m sure there’s more to be said about the length of the battery you’d get with it, game companies like Nintendo should keep an eye for these kinds of moves from tech companies such as Apple. Especially considering how “limited” the portable gaming space is.
Where to get that wallpaper?
It's time for S24 Ultra!
Amazing ❤
I am gonna spoil the party here. WE HAD ALL OF THIS 5 YEARS AGO, SAMSUNG USER HERE
Why is the live photo option available if it’s set as part of the image data of a regular photo
Please compare it to samsung S23 ultra
Better then mkbhd review 👍🏼
Amazing professional review like always. I really enjoy to watch your videos.👍
*Mega....PIXEL* ( he will never disappoint us with his jokes)
To be fair, Samsung is doing the same thing. S21 S22 S23 are pretty much the same phone with minor updates. Before people call me a Apple fanboy, I have and currently use a S23.
I’m not trying to be negative or rude, but you say that there’s no notable changes. What about titanium bro? He say there’s no different color. What about natural titanium? It’s the slickest color they’ve ever released for a pro with a premium material that’s never been used before.
You will never turn that phone that way to take a photo in landscape because the cameras will be at the bottom. Stop the cap.
Did you just give away your fingerprint at 7:41? Easily to be replicated, lol
One day my comment will also be viral 😢😞
Oh i didnt even realise i was early lol
The portrait mode thing works on all iPhones if you take the pictures after having ios17.     I think it's just software based
iPhone 14s
Nothing about spatial video?
Ayooo chill
so a better camera (still shitty zoom) and a more polished same design honestly the only thing that caught my attention is the better processor that can run console quality games (that is actually impressive)
I want to upgrade from my now very sluggish Galaxy S10 because of connectivity. Have an Ipad and Macbook for Uni, this will be my first Iphone. I am leaning more towards the standard 15, the only thing I keep going back on is the 120 Hz. I don't know if I can justify the 250€ extra that it would be for me to get the Pro instead, especially since I don't have airpods yet, although it would only be 10 more Euros a month. I am also trying to avoid buying the 14 pro, since that is also more than the 15 base and doesn't give me Usb C and I would like buying from Apple directly.  Will keep the new phone for at least 3 to 4 years before considering upgrading again. Any thoughts? Would really appreciate some input from people that already have been using Iphones for a while now since I am very new to the idea. Thanks!
That motion picture you are talking about... Samsung had already nailed it back in S8plus..6 years ago...😂😂😂😂
Unless Apple dispenses with their anti-consumer practices, I'm never buying another product from them again.
i still love my Nothing 1.
Sorry but ratio
hmm
miss the timer
Arun and Marques upload their respective review videos at the same time!
Why are u not talking about I phone 12 ban... ??? U are killing Samsung for everything?😡😡😡😡
dude i have nothing to say. you are using your cat as a phone holder while playing game. lmao 😂😂
Yeay
i dont have money so..😅
Are you gonna pick up vaping on future videos? 😅
My guy reviewed more phones than i shat my pants, which is impressive and weird at the same time.
Wow, did apple call you to boost their sales? Many people like me are leaving Apple eco system due to their controlling nature. Sold out “critics” like you can’t convince me to go back to Apple. I know my comment will be deleted but I had to say it.
8:23 easter eggg !!
Not 1 mention of the sim tray!  It’s important to know 😢
Great review love it❤
Giveaway time for me 😂😂😂😢😢
You are biased towards apple product in any case. Don't get me wrong , they are good products but you try even harder to convince everyone that apple products are great .
More money
Man I to me it's like portrait is my default mode 😂
Please send your iPhone 14 to me in nigeria 🙏🏻
Let's go
Nice bro
Ok. Yea , there are definitely some improvements . But "NEXT LEVEL" in the thumbnail isn't anything more than the GOOD OLD Clicky Baity mr.
Do the battery video !!!
the 14 pro also didnt come in a blackbox lmao
Don’t say this time  It’s a draw in comparison 😂
Paying 1200$ for new battery, witch is only 100mAh bigger than in 14 pro max, for me is just insane. Not to mention they are deceiving people when they say it has 48MP camera, when yourself said it is 24, or even 12. Same screen as 14pro max, same software, same cameras...and half of this review is about camera app. And BTW, if EU didn't force them to put USB C port, i simply doubt it they would ever change. And if i would ever spend 1200$ on phone, what i will never do, i DEMAND USB 3 cable, not v2.
waste of money, just get s23 ultra.
MKBHD and mrwhosetheboss posted at exact same time😂  Probably they want a competition that who'll get more views😂
it would actually be great to use usb-c to usb-c so whenever you switch from and android to this beauty it’s a lot easier to find than lightning to usb-c unfortunately, i’m using an iphone se 3
Man you never disappoint us 🙏❤️❤️
Bro you lie just say you like Apple products that it
Dude you should drop the subscribers challenge with Apple....it ain't gonna happen anytime soon...it maybe benefit you to just get more subscribers..
whole video is just justify and finding the use case hahahaha
That moment when you spend a lot and need to prove it was worth it
200 dollar gap*
I'd like to see the action button and the UI talk to each other.  You make the action button the camera or the flashlight, then you can assign the buttons on the lock screen to something other than the flashlight or camera. also multi tap capable action button.  They really need to innovate again.
a
I’ve been using volume up as a shutter for years. Maybe it’s a behavior I carried over from Android.
First time feeling like maybe I should give this apple thing a second chance
nothing new except USB C 2.0 that's disappointing
15 pro is the worst pro model ever, people with 14 pro don’t have any reason to upgrade to 15pro. Instead of 15pro we can go for 15 at least this has many updates from iphone 14
im still on iphone 6s plus lol
7:50 ayo chill 😂
Why no one talks about the lidar upgrade, dats the most crazy piece of tech in that thing compared to Android
e
15:27 Everything before the word "but" is horse shit 😂😂
Am so looking forward to the battery test with other phones again!
I like how all the reviewers upload their videos almost at the same time when a phone is out
if u tried to sell this to audience, i think u failed :)
Why you play RE game with controller? Are touch screen controll not support?
I haven't seen you talk about Huawei phones for a long time!
Just do the camera comparison ASAP
Apple should add a camera mode where it processes the image to look like something clicked on the iPhone SE, I think the old iPhone camera was such a vibe
Apple Event or The Boss The Boss!!
You lost me at “better”
But why not to criticize apple for the ass slow cable in a phone costing more than a $1000, but highlighting the tiny winy feature which no one will ever use, these reviews are not seem worthy nowadays
Iphone 15 review please
7:49 well done 😂
❤
Да
Me watching this thinking that I never use all those fancy functions, and anyway don't have the budget for it so better stick to a cheaper Android, and that's why I end up watching more @TechSpurt videos lately. @Mrwhosetheboss is unfortunately focusing more and more on high end stuffs that we can't afford.
From coming to comparison I would like to know shall I Still keep my iPhone 13 or 14 just wait next iphone 16 comes out
Not me running here exclusively for the camera review... We'll see what the pixel will bring to the table with its own launch
Finally and apple with Android features wow🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
This 19 min video felt like it was an hour long 😂😂
Waiting for camera comparison with s23 ultra
Just waiting for camera comparison
Embargo period ended
girls have long nail so may be thats the reason
Let's vote for a comparison between S23 Ultra and I phone 15 pro....😮😮😮😮😮😮
Please I need one ❤❤❤❤
ayy yooo  clean your chick nails 7:00
Ummm. Back tap feature???  Why am I just learning this???
Damn this is his most booorrrrrrring video
iPhone 15 pro review : better than Samsung paid promotion money  Just kidding 😂
Ended Samsung 😂😂😂😂
Mega 😂i wasn't expecting pixel 😅
This year’s iPhone is so boring and it even makes Arun’s video (which is usually so fun), seem boring.
Mr Whosetheboss and MKBHD I swear upload at the same if not similar time. 🤨
If you’re still arguing about android vs iPhone in 2023, it’s just childish, how do you not understand that people have their preferences and opinionsz
iphone 14 better
That voice isolation is even in samsung budget phone's that's a feature
Why is the background music loud 😢 🤦. I wanna hear your voice clearly not the music
Only in France they doest let you buy with monthly payments???  -.- ffs
cant wait to see the camera comparison video 😂
and now will be the final boss fight between S23 ultra and Iphone 15 pro max
The time is here folks. This guy now has to sell call quality and action button as a feature to market this phone lol
I really love your videos Arun🙂❤️🤩 super detailed
6:58 love how we said pretty and then showed his fiance, what a legend
Please tell us why we shouldn't buy the iphone 15 line up
Android has the HEIF (High efficiency image format) for years now and there are some downsides to it too you cannot transfer it to every device and if you manage to transfer the device may not support playing it
The chip in iPhone 15 pro is named A17 pro so that when they release iPhone 16 (non-pro model) they can release it with a normal A17 chip to increase the difference between pro and non pro models. Idk why no one is noticing or telling about it.
Who’s watching from Nigeria 🇳🇬
The most comfortable iPhones to hold were 3G and 3GS. The rounded back was so smooth and curvy, that was a dream to hold. Never got a phone that was so comfy in the hand like the 3GS.
We need a vs with the S23U comparing 10X optical zoom, fast changing and 8K video recording.
Okay, why does nobody talk about the 14 pro series and 15 pro series OIS inside the selfie camera? Why is under the radar or not even marketed by Apple at all? 🙂  Cheers
Hey Arun, notice how Apple is slowly addressing some of the stuff you've been asking from them?  120Hz, USB-C, Battery, Customization, the sharp edges... They are listening.
This honestly makes me more excited for the pixel 8
I’d love to get one someday😢😂 Console gaming quality on phones has always been what i wanted on iPhones
Also, the iPhone 14 Pro is more expensive than the 15 Pro so they reduced the prices this year 👍🏿
Can you give a honest review
bro im before 1 hour
Bro always releases reviews during the impressions stage lol
man i love your videos, but how much apple payed you to do this?
The biggest change was the name 💀
So are the apps like Resident Evil (the one Arun was playing) downloadable for iPhone 15’s on the App Store?
Wait… back tap feature? That “every iphone has”. Are you sure about that one? My iphone XS and 11 dont seem to have it.
Wait… The Voice Isolation feature has been there for quite a while now on iPhones. I don’t think it’s a new feature. Or am I missing something?
7:50 Whatchu doing there, mate?
I really love your content, but we have to be honest... it's the same as the iPhone 14. 95% of the "new things" are related to software.  😂
Iphone showcasing an android from 5years ago
❤❤❤❤
Would never buy an iphone after owning Iphone 14PM. I have only had the phone for 7months and down to 87% battery health. Absolutely shocking.
Would never buy an iphone after owning Iphone 14PM. I have only had the phone for 7months and down to 87% battery health. Absolutely shocking.
I thought voice isolation was a feature already existing on the iPhone. I use it on my iPhone 14
Gift me 1!!!!!
I'll upgrade if the front camera won't make me extra UGLY like how my ip14pm does. it ACCENTUATES every pore on my skin. Does the iPhone 15 still do that???????
Bro using Cat as a Stand : Mission Impossible
Oh Apple.. Its Bad, Face saving attempt.. 😊 😂  Who else could have done better than @mrwhoestheboss
This new button reminds me of bixby
give me iphone 15 plis
Ayo chill 😂😂😂
Lot of zooming out in this video
I feel your face is washed out in your video. Can you improve your camera or may be edting issue??
i am very sure you made this video with a 15 Pro (Max ) am saying this because of the audio quality
Kitty worked as heat-sink😂😅😊❤
Mega pixel was actually cool 😂
It’s i phone nothing else id there except the ecosystem, can you even Imagine the in 800 bucks phine there's on 60hz doesn’t matter do i need or not but i have to get all of them because i am paying money, right.  This is willingly did-upgrading, makes they got us like products no caring what we need.
next level trash
Where max
ok
I really hope this phone fixes the battery issues if the 14 pro
Can’t wait to buy this in five years
I unsubscribed froM MKBHD Because he was a Fan Boy he got chances to visit the apple headquarters, and meet the CEO because he was a fan Boy. But now Mrwhostheboss is becoming one.
I would really like to see a "camera" only review between this one and the s23 ultra
Arun, you are without a doubt the iPhone 15 pro max of the tech community 👍
0:33 loveee the thinner bezels
A in depth review video of iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 plus would be MEGA......pixel. Especially the battery part and how much it gains on the iPhone 14 pro models.
So basically nothing new. 😢
Another note on the pricing, the $1200 starting is the same that the've been at for the second storage tier, they just removed that base tier. So the price didn't really go up, they're just starting at what used to be that second step now. Higher base price, but you're still getting what you pay for, just like before.
Yawn.
I’m coming from a iPhone XS Max. I’m so excited to get my pro max… it’s a upgrade for me that’s forsure
Great content as usual😊
you can tell that it's not real lens change by looking at the photos. When you use a real lens, with 5x the faces get super wide. Here they stay same.
would we gate a comparision of samsung s23 ultra and iphone 15 pro max ? and we want information on samsung s24 ultra
so funny now that they sponsor this he likes it xd
Same design since 11 with minor tweaks and software updates.  😢
thanks
Please compare iphone cameras with Xiaomi mi 13 ultra 😅...
Every single tech reviewer just dropped all their unboxing videos at 6am
oh you shill love your channel tho
It's Apple, it's not better, it's shit by default
Wifey fine, good job sir
can i have a iphone 15 pls
Compare battery capacity with old iPhones
I don't think I'll ever get used to iPhones coming with a USB-C cable. I'm a Samsung user, so it felt very out-of-place to during the unboxing.
Really don't think the pro is worth it this time the 15 is the best pick here
🔥 ♥
😊
Hooold up... If they wanted to have an almost lossless 2.5-4.9x zoom, (as 2.5 is closer to 1) surely they could have an option to combine the main camera with the zoom camera so that the 5x zoom is cropped to be smaller and then the main camera fills the rest of the image? e.g. if you're on 4.9x zoom then the software matches the edges of the image with the correct size. Basically shrinking 5x zoom to be 4.9x and then filling the remainder of the image with the main camera picture. That was a super overcomplicated explanation but like yk what i mean
2:34 one ui did this better 3:29 useless feature, you won't be able to tell if you can be heard or not
All the more reason I’m stoked to get the natural titanium color
Gets engaged. Fiance appears in more and more vids. Channel name changes to MrsWhosetheBoss. GAME OVER.
How did u start ur channel?
I think undeniably, the iPhone is the best phone on the market. Its fast AND has the greatest reach across the world, for apps and games. Like come on, Assassins' Creed?!
Yeah, no. I'm still skipping this one.
Years past and iPhones are the same. I guess that for the majority of people this is OK, but come on... I bought a 13 Pro, I still notice things that bothered me nearly 2 years ago on these. I may not be the targeted audience, but it's got a "Pro" in the name
Does voice isolation cover baby crying? Asking as a wfh mom! ✨🤩
I think in my whole life I used comment section for actually leaving a comment less than 5 times (besides friends and family), but your channel definitely deserves this.  The way you make these videos is art. Truly art. From a perfectionist human perspective you really tick every box, every question that I might have and for most of the products your review is more than enough to make a good idea. I think your channel is still underrated and really hope you are going to have the success you deserve. From the same perspective, trust me, I can see the stress and hard work behind, may your life be full of achievements and joy.
stop the cap
I’ve been waiting for a whole year to see this video. Next year we see the iPhone 16 🤯
I feel more game developers will focus on iPhones because it is one set of architecture and software instead of Samsung ASUS google and all these other brands that use their own software and not all of them use the latest processors. So it will be more challenging for developers as opposed to bringing games to Apple.
Well done getting up a FULL review when everyone else is just doing unboxings!
i'm not impressed with this iphone 15 pro max. i think i will just have to wait for s24 ultra.
Me with an s7 edge : 👀
who really cares about cable transfer speeds any more? Unless you have tens of gigs to dump to your computer in a hurry, airdrop and other ways of syncing does the job just as good. I can't remember the last time I plugged my phone to my Mac to transfer files
My opinion on that new action button ... not my fav. I liked the switch and it worked well. It's one of the reasons why I switched to iPhone. You can see the status without opening the phone by just seeing or feeling the switch position. Now you have to look at the screen, which means taking the phone out of your pocket.
This "Voice Isolation" feature is nothing new, I literally have it on my XR.
Why this gloves suddenly 😅 I feel hand is better
The iPhone 15 is a disappointment.
the base 256g pro max costs A$2.2k. why is it so expensive in australia?? i get currency fluctuations and how australia may have weaker currency but still?? it’s like almost double the price in the US 😫😫
E
Commenting for algorithms 😊
AYO CHILL! 🤨🤨 What was that?
Never gonna buy iPhone 😢but want to know every new feature as if I am going to buy 😂😂
S23 ultra v iphone 15 pro max camera battle.
iPhone fifthin Pro Max😅 For the bazzel!🫶🏼
Yup. I'm keeping my 14 Pro Max. No matter how these influencers tries to sugar coat all the "new features" on the latest iPhone, they cannot hide that this is almost the same iPhone that was released 3 years ago.
Ayo chill lol
I think that hairline is going a bit too far or is it just me 😅 ??
Me up nearly till 12am to watch this
Ah... but can it make a phone call?
Excellent as always 👍
I love the “voice isolation” feature on my iPhone XR literally ☺️
So it's more like an Samsung then a iPhone...
I didn't have 4 kidneys to Buy an 15 ultra😅😢
Basically nothing new ..
Anyone got both Mkbhd and Arun's notification together😀
Maybe we can use the button for gaming as a trigger!! Killing 3D touch may cover this loss for iPhone! But the delay people talking about may also kill this feature for gamers! :(
The Arun fanboys believing this shit is pure comedy xD
999$ to 1199$ is 200$ not 100$ man😂
just let samsung release the s24 ultra  😂😂
Can it take a photo of the moon like Samsung??
Seriously 19 minutes
Love the show keep it up 😁😀
🔥
My chips & coffee is ready 😇
The Norwood reaper is coming for you sir.. nice video doe
love your vids
Wallpaper link please
😂 Ayo chill 😂 7:50
You're still not married?! (3:16 "fiancée on the phone") When is the wedding? Don't keep her hanging! 😉 (10:22 anniversary)
Ji
sardi hui hai na ? 😆
im waiting for your battery test to decide if im gonna buy the pro max or not. kinda exited
Damn bro😊😊
Pr cable for 79$ :D Dongle for 30$ :D
Super excited for the camera comparison already 💪🏻
“Wow” - Tim Cook
The notch Iphones have been the same since the 12 for regular users, now, for power users Ipho e 15 is really worth but so far there was nothing revolutionary, is up to the people, if they have a 12, 13, and 14, they should keep those but if you want the latest and greatest go for the 15.
How this guy brought phone to make video this early 😮
Best iPhone ever❤
nothing new nothing special, apart from the fact that they decided to finally use all the power of their phones in the gaming mode😊
Lmao Apple bought the reviewers this year even more.
Lol who else saw the "ayo chill" text?
POV: has no intention on buying iPhone 15 but watches videos because of Arun
you can use burst shot to capture photos faster
Its a great day when mrwhosetheboss uploads!
The bezels don’t really make a difference
Who’s watching but not afford 😂😂
the pro max is 200 dollars more expensive not 100 as you said
Where is the outro man 💔 I still watch the giveaway video just to hear that beautiful remix 😔
Who is  Still Watching even   Can't afford it  😅😅😅😅
It's hard to earn the money as reviewer, small things are not enough to justify the price. Next time compare them to iphone 11... 😂
Why is that Apple sticker given ??
Why do you often neglect to address aspects such as call quality and Wi-Fi connectivity in your reviews? I recently purchased the S23 Ultra based on your review, but I am currently facing significant issues with both call quality and Wi-Fi connectivity. Surprisingly, even my previous Vivo X70 Pro had a crisper and louder mono speaker compared to the S23 Ultra. Additionally, the Wi-Fi on this device takes an unusually long time to establish a connection. Moreover, I find the portrait mode in the camera to be subpar, as it tends to make human skin appear tanned and darker after image processing. It would be greatly appreciated if renowned YouTubers like you would include such essential information in your reviews to prevent others from encountering similar post-purchase difficulties.
Excited to see it for myself!
Love your videos you get to the point really fast no fluff and professional investigative work fantastic that’s why everyone watches cheers.
My pc can do everything this phone can what a waste of money. I’ll stick to my pc. pc > Apple any day
Nailed it
Vodafone UK💀💀💀💀💀💀
We need under screen front cameras... ZTE seems to be the only one doing that...
The blue titanium 🤤🤤
Apple just Want You To Come over to your door and say HELLO IM SELLING LEMONADE  and everytime they make a new phone just only stuff they put like this *take the previous phone and add 2 or 3 New feature which actually have on every other previous iphones* apple is like sitting in the basement lazy sleepy adding plastic and And take one iphone and throw at the new phone they are creating And they say This is The best phone u can get just like a ps5  but on a phone
lol ofc they give you the cheap usb c cables
Hey Aaron. Does iPhone 15 Pro already have the new “maximum battery charge limit” option in settings?
Same
Not sure if the voice isolation is only in 15 series. I have it on my iPhone 12 too in FaceTime. Never tried on a normal call though.
So the “AAA Games” are exclusive to 15 pros not even to regular 15s and 14 pros
Action button looks so ugly in this phone Alert slider was more practical  Like you know when it’s muted or not They could’ve add those action button features to the power button there was no need of an extra button   I am gonna miss alert slider ❤ 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 I want alert slider back
my iphone 12 pro has that voice isolation function.
Iam from Bangaldesh 🇧🇩🇧🇩🇧🇩
Am mrwhosetheboss and I will catch you in the next one
Not including a fast cable is just beyond!
I can't wait to but the 15 Pro Max after 2 years!
Great review!! Putting into real life use. My new phone comes on Friday!!!
Does all the camera software  features  applies for 15 also?
Always better than you think.
I thought Apple killed the sim tray and moved on to Esim but...there's a Sim ejector? What's that for?
How am I just now learning about back tap, my mind has just been blown
I liked my own comment
no way they kept that big notch lol
*The difference between you and Marques is that the American is a friend of the brand and must speak well of it... you, for example, are the only one who speaks without having to hide things and without fantasies. THANK YOU SO MUCH*
Titanium dents, but 99% of us will have a case on it anyways, so I'll take the weight savings, as the SS iPhones are heavy as a brick otherwise! 😂
This phone is not worth it and    there's no way to sugarcoat it
Samsung has been flexing HEIF since s20....lolll😂😂😂.....giving more flexible features🥲
same shit different year
This phone is not worth it and    there's no way to sugarcoat it
Antutu score?
This phone is not worth it and    there's no way to sugarcoat it
Deym i wish i have one🥺
How much Radiation does this one put off?
Hey there am big fan of your always watch your videos and also helps me but Bro the blur effect is too slow in between every clip of this video 😢😢
Did you Get the iPhone already?
1 Day My Comment Also Viral 😢
Mkbhd and mrwhosetheboss the make good videos. But they are too fanboying apple , if any Android had done it , people and these influencer will eat them giving low review
5:42 cringe moment yaiks.
What a great review! So many specific yet important aspects were covered. Besides, all the geeky stuff is explained in an interesting way!
Damn
Those slightly thinner bezels makes a huge difference in the way you view it now. We're not far off now to the perfect iPhone.
🥱 I like how all these paid reviews drop at the same time
Bro compare S23 Ultra with both 15pro & 15pro max so that there can be more things and difference to look about the 3x & 5x zoom camera
Reverse charging is great but why am I charging your phone with my 3274mAh battery😅
i have 13 pro max is the 15 pro worth it or should i just get the 14 pro max
Still ......will ...go with sammy........
Whenever I get a notification from Arun I quickly find a nice stop and enjoy the video fully.
Hate fanboys
The Samsung s8 alredy had an extra programmable button lol
This video is criminally overprocessed
How much did apple pay you😂
Sony already did it in it's Xperia 5 they have a shutter button
just the smaller boarders is worth 100 dollars for me. great video
This is Epic but idk why but 15 pm doesn't look enough of an upgrade s23 u takes the W in my opinion
Woah this was much much better than the MKBHD video released at the same time
Yo it's cool that a phone can now play desktop level games, but where is monitor support apple? Samsung DeX is a thing, why is there no magic apple cointerpart? What is the point if I have to play on a small ass screen
mr.bean 😂
Jesus christ the editing and music background in this video is so good. Thats an instant subscribe lol
congrats if you are tapping that girl
i like how you show us and give us details about new device 🎉  And iphone is a boring company now It just give us one phone and still can't give us something different 😔
Can we have a link for a phone holder like urs?
“Console gaming on a phone?!?”  Android users that have emulated for over a decade: 🙃
Please don't waste tap water 🙏💦
Weeks from now I can buy (hopefully)
It still was jarring going from instant photo results on the X and prior, to seeing a moment of post processing on the 14PM when viewing a shot right after taking it.
Do a battery test please!!!
The real question is, how long can it actually play those 'console' games before it begins to overheat and throttle?
At this point I think Apple already made an ideal phone but decided to sell the components parts per year.
Voice isolation is already there in Samsung
6:48 -  love that little effect you added on there
I am the 149 thousandth viewer! Show some love ❤
But 17:36 but youn need to still cary a usb c to c cable android  can wirelessly since 2019 and with a cable from 2013 or something. But its nice that iphone users have atlest something from old androids🎉
Love your vids ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
You put on your corporate shill hat 🎩
Felt like pushed marketing, justifying something not worth spending 1K for
bro doesnt talk about the biggest thing about innovation being dead in apple these days... rather talks about small niche things that doesnt really matter to most of the people. avg apple marketing guy... all creators are same nowdays..
Lytro technique: focus on things AFTER you have taken the shot. Nice one Apple!
This video feels like you guys rushed to make it.
good review but ı'm wondering Why do your nails shine 🙂
No mylo was hurt
was today years old when i realised my iphone has a back tap feature :/
I wished the action button could print money. But jokes aside, the only thing keeping me away from an iPhone camera (other than lens flaring) is the iconic yellow watercolor tinge on people's faces (all the time), and the inability to portrait more than 1 subject in a single frame. If I wanna take a portrait selfie of 3 people, it can only create depth on 1 subject.
the moment when a video for a new iPhone is 85% dedicated to a camera is sad. Very good innovations Apple
How did you play Resident 🤔
Can You pls do a review on One plus pad or any good tabs for a change
Next video iphone 15 vs s23
cool
I love the iphone ❤🔥
The only thing I like is the action button
iPhone nowadays is very unappealing. It's basically the same phone for the past 4-5 years based on aesthetics.
Apple never disappoints.
999$ yeaa... Checking prices in EU 1200€ (1283$).. Nooo
Odd quirk of voice isolation: it doesnt recognize childrens voices. Im guessing they are too high pitched
I really appreciate how Apple pay YouTubers to mark out small features when they can't upgrade the big features. They are only marketing and the phone is almost same
Nah, don't like it 🤷
Could you do a review video for the iPhone 15?
Arun Keep Up The Content, The Editing Is Getting Crazier And Crazier Every Time
Why Arun doesn't make videos for other phones. Like he did in the past years?
Good
Comment on my iphone 15 pro max 1TB storage fully paid 👋
First thing about 15pros, buy a better usb c cable
i dont feel like playing AAA games on such a small screen with small icons etc. is really enjoyable
1 gm feels light,really!
In general iphone have features that other phones, have many years before! But when they are in iphone, people get crazy! Yes is the same like last year, but now is not shiny, is mat, mat is better, next iphone will be shiny, and people, shiny is better, feel more premium, and boom 1600 euro
Samsung already had most of the camera Features already. Portrait Mode is usable afterwards, you can Start on the camera Mode you left (not zoom tho) , you can take heif pictures
Me watching this on my iPhone 7:🗿
Make a giveaway
I got foods ready🎉
Camera Brightness! What about the nits, is it 1500 sustained because that's a big deal when using your phone outside. We use 2000nit high bright monitors and some even closer to 3000nits and it makes a big difference. Of course they're a lot bigger and better at heat dissipation so 1500nits on a phone seems wild!
So iphone 13 pro max can do exactly the same things as an 15 pro max, why waste money! They should’ve ended with the 14!  You can’t make this phone looks better. Because is the same phone 2 years ago!
18:30 5x zoom worth 200 bucks
iPhone is really becoming a joke i love your content but iPhone is really expensive for a extremely limited phone. Very old functions and technology
love you
Don't really care bout the iphone, just here for my weekly dose of mrwhosetheboss
my Xperia z1 has the same button @mrwhosetheboss
The 14 Pro already came in a white box.
You didn't colour grade your STUDIO clips in this Video !!!!!!!
Seriously? You turn the iPhone or any other phones CLOCKWISE to take a photo? Our hands hold the camera more on the bottom than the top. This way your fingers would be blocking the cameras. I really hoped the action button would be somewhere on the right edge below the power button. Weird for other actions but perfect as camera shutter as how they advertise the iPhone 15 pro as a film making tool. Yes I ordered one bcos it has USB-C and yeah I do think the action button is a good idea but placed at a wrong location. Let it be my last iPhone upgrade unless they come up with a foldable. Oh sorry I forgot to mention that the volume buttons already act as shutter buttons. The action button being slightly above is redundant.
Hope you don’t miss while charging Trisha like you did with the phone 😂😂
Man they have differences.
are you justifying..?
This is a powerful new smartphone fit for the future!!!
Wait it released already?
Its a refined version of 14 pro lineup
I liked my comment
those little things doesnt justify a $1000 spending.
Voice isolation has been here for long
Just watched Marques, and he said it is the same as last year, and we all know that one is the same as 10 years ago😂
dang, iphone on the outside will always be same, but the inside will not
Kinda boring update if you ask me. Also wish iOS17 would bring more of a visual update.
Sony shutter button prodigy
watching this video makes me want to buy the blue one instead of the black one😭😭😭😭
Okay the camera sounds like a worth it upgrade over my 14 Pro tbh.
its not that ahead in time . next few years and the phone will come up with RTX  5000 graphics card.
Don't really care bout the iphone, just here for my weekly dose of mrwhosetheboss
PS4 supports HDR
watching this video makes me want to buy the blue one instead of the black one😭😭😭😭
I have a question, how can you get the iPhone 15 ? It’s only pre-order, how??
same
Youtubers are the clones for iphone....this is the only reason  where iphone is surviving...else s 23u is at top in the market and value for money
how much is apple paying you bro?
We need a comaprison with yhe pixel 7 pro
would be cool if apple made joycons for those games
really? a rickroll out of nowhere?
11:40 A lot of phones can alr do that lmao
You always do great reviews man. Your review of the S23U sold me. If they drop the 24 next February and you say it’s a go. Well I’ll be getting that. Done with my iPhone
yee haw
They literally added one thing💀💀💀💀
I am not sure on what basis apple phones are being hyped. when front and back is glass what is the point in discussing about titanium on sides?? does it going to help saving "phone case" (THE MAJOR environmental damage PLASTIC SCAM OF EARTH???) point no. 2 apple talks about saving environment bla bla bla just a little rewind when whole world is going for USB-c apple deviated to have lightning cable now coming back.. so in coming yrs your will see billions (lightning cables) of cables come in to trash year by year. Can they take responsibility??? Just close your eyes and think about these two points. Nothing is impossible right for apple why cant they make phone like 5C (with metal on back) so atleast 50-60 % of people stop buying plastic cases.
Of course Mrwhosetheboss liked the new Iphone  XD
Phones are overrated
First Ugandan to watch this video 🥰🥰🥰 much Love from UG to UK😊
When Arun is paid to say good things 😅
Most boring update are done in iPhone
I am still gonna stay with my android phone because yeah as a roblox youtuber i only love android phones
Can you switch between lenses while recording 4k 60 ? Or still only possible in 30
So Samsung was really wise not to give their flagship the brightest screen 😂
will it be able to run gta 6 ?
34 minutes late. Bt I'll be followed by millions later. 😅😅😅😂
So there are literally no new features but a bunch of minor improvements... Good job...😂       S23 Ultra rocks
How to download resident evil village on the 15 pro anyone?
hi
btw playing that game in the iphone wil turn into 1 hour battery life and after 30 min is going to thermal throttle
I hope someone got revenge on my part for that pun 16:06
34 minutes late. Bt I'll be followed by millions later. 😅😅😅😂
Yeah! I'm listening 🎧
5:50 yeah the only thing you have is your phone. Then where will you get the huge controller from? 😂 I will wait for iphone 16 and see how much good it is before deciding to buy.
Sorry but I’ll keep my iPhone 12 Pro. 😊
Honestly upgrading is not a necessity anymore, you can easily skip 2 to 3 generations and be completely fine.
Support Ex-Muslim movement
Where can i get that wallpaper please
Poor Milo. Hardest working member of this channel. 😂
14 pro = 15
👎👎👎
Aruns really trying hard to sell the apple phone better than apple itself. The type c cable was mainly due to the EU forcing them to do it..
I’ll only upgrade once every 4 years now. The incremental changes just aren’t justifiable for me to upgrade. I have the iPhone 13 Pro .
nowadays Aaron is faking the reviews. he has became an apple ambassador instead of true tech reviewer. Unsubscribing after 6years
Bruh
Iphone reviews since iphone 11 be like:  The new iphone really is different than the last one, you guys. Just look at this thing that they changed that  you are never going to notice
I swear I called it😭😭😭 I just knew he’s gonna say pixel after saying mega
Just came from MKBHD's review.. biggest difference is the sim ejector tool not available in US market :(
Is 128GB enough for the pro, especially considering that you might be running console games on it?
Paid video
resident evil 4 with dynamic island🤣🤣
S23 ultra vs iphone 15 pro max camera comparison?
God I've got an Apple ad before the video 😂
I love these tech videos I never watched these kind of vids but I am obsessed soo good arun keep up the good work
Draging the shutter button to take quick photo in Samsung
They could just impliment these changes in a new software update
Waiting for the comparison.. I luv your videos Arun.. Amazing..❤
With all due respect, you are obviously a big apple fan, hence biased ... personally I feel that you  are exaggerating apple's new faeture as if they are a big deal , they are OK but not a wow factor
This video was sponsored by Apple
Who noticed Arun in this video is stressed?
Can we shoot 48 megapixel with the normal 15?
it’s the 15th one which is my lucky number so worth it 😎😎
You can charge others phone with S8 series  It's not a new thing  You can wireless charge your phone with S20 series
If only I had Arun as my history teacher :)
Hopefully GTA 5 will come to iPhone
Ay mate what do you think about the flipper zero?
O bhai😮😮😮
PS4 games you mentioned are running 1080p not 900p, and PS4 and Xbox One did support HDR too.
such a crisp review.. impressive indeed
Anyone know where the phone wallpaper in the thumbnail is from?
yall didnt have voice isolation? 💀
JP
i love Aaron but  for this review it was not that convincing(sorry) the features are just the same, the only thing is the over emphasis on the cameras and using the usbc(tbh people thinking this is a feature and selling it as such because of being forced to compromise is stupid) there's nothing more to sell on the phone just those two
I will stick to S23 ultra 😒
noice🫡👍🏻
voice isolation has been there on iphones for ages. That is not a new feature.
Does anyone know where I can get that wallpaper on the thumbnail please?
My bet is $25000.
bravo how apple just copied sony with that action button..only that sony has fixed it for camera and apple made the choice of the consumer.. they just improvised
AYO CHILL 😂😂😂😂😂
I just wish a new company comes to beat Apple. Getting bored of apple now😂
Just stop it’s bad
iPhone users trying to justify how little effort apple has put on new iphones:
It seems good . I will buy it in 4 years
Sponsored by Apple
Am thinking about your payment..... from apple 😂
I think you are so BEYOND TALENTED @apple needs to give you prerelease phones 📱 always because your quality and production level and thoughts are really impressive BRO. ⚡️❤️🤙 I know it isn’t easy but you make it look easy.
Wish could afford this as i live in Pakistan buying iphone is like a dream :)
We need a link to those wallpapers! 🤩🤩
I like watching videos of phones i can't buy😢
Are these hardware leaps or mostly software? could an update of the previous generation get the older phone to act at a similar level in many of the applications?
Better than u think, it has forced usb c
Now it’s similar to Sony Xperia 1 v only camera position and OS is different
Generating excuses for the poor location the button ...
Well , Iam in a great confusion since the launch event🥲 whether I should go for pro max just for 5x and battery or shall i go for pro itself
Mrwhosetheawesomest 😎
So I guess the iPhone 15 pro is just iPhone 14 pro max ultra 😏
What about battery life?
For the price buy a laptop and play on 1080p 😂
Apple really didn't mention this that is amazing I'm so upgrading and so is my Android loving fanboy friend he's now team Apple
Same mid phone
Hi
Type C is worst, gets problem easily
can we see the unboxing of the blue iphone 15 pro
I got the milk tea ready *British rizz*
I hope we get a lot more aaa games bc the potential for handheld gaming is crazy
So I’m an SOC engineer, and he’s wrong on Apple silicon being similar to android. Nothing Qualcomm offers is remotely close, Apple is running away in the ARM race.
Voice isolation is on 14 Pro Max also... and probably other older models.
Man used his cat to hold up his iPhone 💀
i haven't watched the vid but i know he's gonna Rick roll us😭
I almost never use the camera
S23U user here. This is what I love about iphones. Few ground breaking features, but they deliver with quality.   I use android btw because it matches my personality better.
early
We are pretty much at a point that there aren't any more big stuff you can put in a smartphone
i can already tell this video is going to be cool
Remote control to play your Ps games in mobile exist for what, from ps3 generation? I think so at least ps3 had it with psp and if ps3 didn't ps4 did have it in mobile so this is old stuff and you're pointing it as a next big leap for crappy iPhone. Cheers mate.
Super video.
another day of watching something i will never buy.
So you have to pay 1.2k $ to get those minor changes?
hi can i   pls
The cable is not a feature the only thing is  the action button is good the camera has the features of 2018 android 😂😂 yes apple polish them but the features which are good a better charging speed like 33 watts or better the AAA gaming experience will not be the best because AAA games at least need more then 100gb so the 256gb version will be useless  and this move a lot of the consumers to buy the 512 version
Arun, could you make a Video of the best Video Games which should be playable on Smartphone?   For me it would be Mario Kart and Super Smash.
11:17  AGAIN samsung  has this even for my a12 which was 180€ in 2021 Inovation😮😮😮😮😮
Didn’t voice isolation already a feature? I use 14 pro and using voice isolation regularly
Is this video shot on the new iphone?...the quality is off from your usual videos
I’m gonna need you to compare to iPhone 14 pro max not 11 that would be more honest bc of course it’s (15 pm) is more powerful then 11pm
this is my opinion*imp no hating am just criticizing*  I don't care what you say about the iPhone 15 but being forced to use a usbc cable and calling it a feature is dumb and people thinking its revolutionary is just consumer madness, the action button was always on android so no new feature(it is a revamp on Samsung's 2019 Bixby key) the only things i see is the voice isolation but even that is still a better copy of android 13,and the phone console gaming stuff and the camera (which even if its so overhyped 80% of people who aren't influencers or content creators don't even get to use its full capacity) in short its just a an iphone 13 with a slight, SLIGHT improvement.
17:32 thanks for shouting out my birthday, sir 😎
swear its only 1g lighter?
So i believe the cameras are better than the S23 ultra.
do apple watch ultra 2 and series 9 review plssssssss
Bro I litterly have a 4080 ti in my pocket like... just use cloud gaming brah
I can't wait til you do the pixel 8 review!
Arun are you trying to make us buy iphone 😊 Or is the iphone really good  Cause the event was a bummer Sry if something went wrong
To all apple haters      If you still hate apple, if this video were in emojis, it would be like : 🙄🖕
this is why I love about iPhones and stick to them no matter what, the simplicity and reliability. I can be confident that my phone can deliver extraordinary photos without any tinkering or thinking. I can be confident of it's performance, longevity and software support. I can be confident of the privacy and security. Sure android phones might have it but in reality none of them will match the reliability of iPhones. Call me a fanboy, I don't care. The lesser I have to use my mind to make decisions on insignificant things, the more I can use it on things that matter.
You keep forgetting to say it’s a Ad ….
Stop trying to convince people to buy iphone 15 pro max 😂🤣 which doesn't have any new feature
Arun is such a mega iphone lover.
Omg i love youtube live comments its like subway surfers 🥰
If you wanted to charge an iPhone 15 pro with another iPhone 15 pro how does the phone know which phone to charge? 😮
Thank you for the video
In Germany the 15 Pro Max is even cheaper compared to the 14 Pro Max with the same storage
Is there anyone else watching this review who is 100% sure they won't buy this overpriced device?
Bruh I wanted 15 review not 15 pro max 😢
i have a challenge for you, take a picture of a salt water aquarium tank under when it is lit under blue lights.
Iphone 15 Pro Max 1450 euro vs S23 Ultra - 920 euro
The portrait mode on any photo thing. Can't that be done on literally ANY Android phone in Google photos? You can use the volume button to take photos too. Apart from the camera, how is this phone in any way a revolution?
Yayaayayayayayaya
Who else is waiting for “ur i phone is ready sir”?
Your the best
Actually i want that iphone 15 Pink one soo badd !!! i love that colourrr  zero two <3
After watching this video i can conclude S23 Ultra still *A KING OF SMARTPHONES! 👑*
If this keeps going on, people might ditch the idea of having a separate phone and gaming console and instead decide buy the best iPhone available on the market!
13 minutes ago
Little by little, there is improvement in technology....
Did anyone notice the colour grading of this video is in line with the colour of iPhone 15 pro's? This particular Mrwhosetheboss video has much duller colours than the other ones. Just like the colour scheme of these 15 pro's.
The day there is no dynamic island and no other disturbance on the screen....thats when i will buy the pro max version....let me be clear the 15 pro max is just state of the art but I'd just buy a regular 13 and wait...i mean sure if you have money then who cares just buy every year...
At least they mention on the product page that the video playback time of the 15pro is 3 hours more than the 14 pro
The problem is Arun is too sweet to iPhones. His personal choice becomes a barrier in the right judgement. Samsung hands down is far better in everything camera when compared to iPhones.
So I wanted you to know Arun… YOU ARE MY FIRST IPHONE 15 PRO REVIEW 😮
For me it's the right time to switch from android to iOS despite the price just cause of USB C,3nm chipset that's a big move
Seems like apple sponsored this video. Samsung is way better than apple. Where is the innovation ? Arun please explain.  Pretty crap
damm I never wondered this
how did bro make 19 min video abt last years iphone copy
🍎 paid Mr.whoosethe Boss 😂
Still collecting money to buy an iphone 12 but here they are announcing iphone 15 too, and will announce others too 🙂💔
For the battery test it'd be helpful if you list which version of ios (and andriod) the phones are running since battery life can wary between versions
Coba buat di pakai edit video "jj alight motion 60fps" bang
waste of money to upgrade nothing new they said it all recycle but the price is still high? what does it mean? it means they will have more revenue from the consumer and more money for the content creator.. tell us the true and dont tell us lies.... zoom camera? Samsung already does it.
Google has had every single feature you're acting like is brand new for years. Stop
I will get that phone on 2026
Awesome video as always
The one thing i just don’t get is why did only the pro max get the 5x telephoto and not the pro, it makes the standard 15 and standard pro seem so similar almost making it more worth it to get standard over pro
Nooo milo is a phone standat 4:56
Les see what we get in note 24
Still not worth upgrading 😂 An ‘S’ upgrade considering the price 💀
Is this jst my phone or the video colors seems a lil dull?
Arun flashed us and thought we would't notice
S24 Ultra will crush this so bad
Your the best
Please compared the Samsung s23ultra❤🎉
Once again Apple maganges to milk already existing features and repeated design, and once again we pretend to be okay with it for the sake of the brand loyalty.
😮
Me watching on my 2018 Galaxy Note 9😂
The only reason iPhones are a turn off for me is that they're not as customizable as androids. If that wasn't taken into account however, they're killer phones!
Broooo, the gigachad music!!!
Samsung users comment below how many of these features we have since many years or updates 🤣🤣
They should’ve added the action button to the base iPhone 15
Booring 😅
Well, at least it has USB-C finally.  Still has that goofy dynamic mustache and Duplo block camera design.
i want the cat stand for playing on mobile😂😂
Can't afford button ↓
Wallpaper link please?
5:30 no to mention the iphone dont have any active cooling. Strap a fan to that poor iphone 🥲
The action button -> the fingerprint function in next iPhone
1 hour gang!
My S21 Ultra can focus on other things after getting that shot in edit section
Buying Latest iPhones is like wearing same cloths again and again like zuck 😂
Me watching this even though I will never buy an Iphone just because I like to see where tech is heading
Mrwhosetheboss and chill. ❤
the GOAT
I stole the guys popcorn
Whatever Arun pays his editors, it is not enough!
Great
this is a Bias apple tech youtuber lol
Make IPhone 14 pro vs IPhone 15 pro
What’s the equipment used to hold the phone in landscape mode at around 13:17 ish?
🔥🔥
Just finished watching one more i phone line up launched but still can't afford it
New gaming phone, RIP asus
Rubbish mate, all profits for you and Apple, customers are not getting value for the price🤦
Me watching yet unable to afford one 💀
7:51 💀
Correction. Pro Max is 200 dollars more than the Pro
😂
Was looking for an unpaid review
We need the comparison right now!!!!!
While wtaching this my iphoke is upgrading to i0s17 💀 watching on s22
The gaming part is pretty cool. Sucks that I bought a backbone one for my iPhone 13 that won’t work with my 15 now because of the switch to usb-c
it's not faster to take pictures on the iphone, you just didn't use burst mode
hi
🐑
The first generation that i actually consider to buy, and only beacuse of one single feature...
mrwhosetheboss day 24 of asking to make a minecraft review
I GOT AN AD FOR THIS WHEN I CLICKED LOL
Wallpaper?
All tech YouTubers using the new iphone for a week when they just received theirs and just uploaded the video
7:05 wdym "much lighter" it's 1 gram lighter 💀💀💀
Pleased to see apple develop so much since its first Iphone
So no reason to change my 14 pro max. Thanks for the breakdown
I'm getting thirteen mini. The fifteen and forteen is boring 😒
Yes
Still not enough for me to buy it. They should've named it the iPhone 14.5
can somebody please explain how is the phone able to run an AAA title game ...do you have to download it from some store or is it running on some server just displaying it on the phone
For me it was a no brainer. My old phone is an iPhone X. After 6 years and at the end of the updates, it is time to move on.
bro def got pad for this review we all know its CTRL + C
it is 2023 and still any 200$ will completely own this new iPhone 15 pro , apple is not even trying to fight android any more, it knows it has lost long ago.
Looks like they’ve paid you well!!
First 30 mins lol
Slow type-C cable in the box isn't standard. Every mid range  phone provides fast cable in the box
S23 ultra be like-" I am waiting for you  iPhone my old friend"
Here before 100K  | V
Fan boy
You speak like iPhone ebassdor 😮
The review I was waiting for 🙏🙏
apple gona get screwd on the camera
we've reached a performance level where camera quality is the only recognisable difference
this is a big change! thanks for making this video to inform us!
Apple did some pretty good stuff with the 15 Pro. Got USB-C half a decade after Samsung finally
I use my phone on an average of every 2 months, im good
Same phone nothing special and doesn't justify the price
Best YouTuber ever!! I can’t wait for my iPhone 15 Pro Max
Aside from the camera, this year Iphone is underwhelming 🤷‍♂️
Add pixel also
I’m still on a iPhone eleven
A
I swear . No one can beat you on reviews <3
hi
Any giveaway? 😅
Less than 30 mins gang
I don't feel like spending  this much money is  worth for a smartphone.
Garbage release.  Hard pass
I dont usally get ads on any videos but when i watch any tech releated thing video start with unskipable ads why?
POV your phone says it was uploaded 1 minute ago but you are 16 minutes through the video.
Using Milo as a smartphone stand to play "Resident Evil." 😂😂😂😂😂😂 are you trying to say that he is an evil resident? 😉😉😉😉
Bro Colab with Austin Evans🙏🙏🙏😊.
9:32 Arun Bro, One Slight Misinformation Here, S23 Ultra has a 1.5X Faster shutter than the 15 Pro Max, Just That You Have to Slightly Tweak The Settings on the Camera assistant App, But Overall Great Video👍👍👍
You tech reviewer are stressing(and I understand why) but this is almost a 0 upgrade from the 14 Pro. The amount of hype for a new phone is crazy compared to if a new model with incremental upgrades in anything else wouldn't be impressive.
My broke ass watching another year of iPhone reviews LOL
Invite me to your wedding 🤓
One hour gang
Can't wait for the comparison between Samsung and iPhone
Waiting for the comparisons because I doubt this phone can really beat the Samsung S23 by any significant margin, that's if it even does
I like how Arun props up his phone against Milo 💀
Apple's best selling camera product! 📷😁🤩
You know the phone hasn't improved when 3 minutes into the video, the only positive thing they have mentioned is the new button.
Iphone is great ❤
It's the best iPhone, and one of the worst smartphones at the same time lol
Any chance someone has that wallpaper?
So I phone  mainly concentrates on camera, over 10+minutes of this video is of Camera..
Voice isolation isn’t new
did you just rickroll us at 8:22 hahahaha
22 MINUTES AGO BOIII
I hope the iPhone 20 Pro, bro max, wax, will be special
Arun did a better (non-sponsored) review on the Iphone 15 than apple themselves...haha
When u dont find any quality, U rely on Call quality.. Hahaa..Tech(Apple) reviewer
Google Pixel 7 >>
iPhone 14 was a scam
I got my jealousy ready
isnt it a 200 € gap from 999 to 1199 is 200
I have waited for the embargo lift to see the phone IN HAND - LETS GOOO
Androids have heif too
Some might say that this is overrated, but this is dope.
My boy aron u still trynna take over mkbhd😂
😂😂😂 PHONES I CAN'T AFFORD
amazing video arun i will wait for your next videos👍
this video is . . . . . . . . . . . Mega
Bro used his Milo as a mobile holder 🤣
sir will u give me a heart ?? 🙏
Way too soon for a real review lol
The motion mode was on in Samsung galaxy S23 ultra  so that's why it was slow while taking the photos
Im still not going to buy it
Voice isolation in Samsung a54 😅
5:02 did anyone see you playing your games like that? 😂
They thought they were slick by selling the same color but with different names
Gimmicks rather than actual review
same phone every year
I got a nuttela ad b4 this
Anyone upgrading from 11?
Why yes, the wild Milo rests peacefully, planning it's next evil scheme... 2:20
75k 21 mins ago☠
I ordered a Nat Titan 15 pro max on pre order time through a carrier store. It got processed but I don't know when it will arive
Even if iphone 15 pro max would cost 300 bucks, i would never buy it! Such a waste of money!!!
We can use volume to take pictures before
Got the white 1TB model coming!!
Pro ordered the pro in blue can’t wait 😍
Who else can't afford :)
When you realize All pubg players single 😅😅
2:19 NO WAYYY!!!  Its no like sony xperia phine had that from 2011 or something 😅 And its on the spot Arun prefers.
Hola am I early????
You know it's a bit of a red flag when you spend half the time of a phone review talking about is camera
The fact that we called the 11 pro's lens size 'BIG' when it got released and now seeing it side by side at 8:00 with the 15 pro is just
BACK TAP FEATURE????
Tbh iphones have gotten boring now!
Apple need to start making its own game controllers for Mac/iPhone/iPad as with how the power of GPU is so good I could see Apple giving Nintendo a run for its money, as if its running PS4 quality games then that better than the current switch offering
Pre ordered 🎉 already new color ❤
Hi
Mrwhosetheapplefan
It’s now sort of software war than a hardware war there’s no longer big jumbs in the camera quality
They definitely are starting to make the phones look the same every year but I believe the stuff they're doing backend software wise is definitely making it a new phone each year. However the caveat with that is it doesn't really entice you to want to buy it
The new update of iPhone 15 would be "Nothing phone"
Been very excited for this !!!!! ❤❤❤❤
14:22 is that gigachad in thw background i hear?
you can press the up volume button when you take a picture! i literally just tried now for the first time and worked without any setup whatsoever!!! stop kissing apple ars that much!!!!!
But I think the 15 and the Pros are so much closer in terms of specs that it's better to get the 15.
Again Watching things i can't afford 😅
Im scared, how is he so fast to upload 😂
Lol am waiting for an Xperia 1 V review if it comes out 🙃 i really enjoy your videos 😂😂
Apple after this: So how much do we owe you? 💵
I think isnt upgrade att all especially chip and efficiency
Is samsung dropping anything new soon 🤔
11:13 arun needs to calm down😂
These days its difficult to spot a difference between these smartphones hardware wise. The battle is becoming more of software one than hardware.
699 comments in the first 20mins good job, 😂. This 1 makes it 700
Bro got paid for review
With the prices i could buy a bike here 😢 @Mrwhosetheboss
Love to see your work bro
that button thing is 10 years old😂 same shit different year 😅
Great fun learning about iPhone 15. Every video of yours is a masterpiece. I love them
Just  say the shortcut button is unaccesible instead of justifying for the camera option. Be honest and have the gut to accept the truth
Samsung also uses HEIF as well as HEVC but it's an opt in
Most people won't even notice these, so technically it's just 14 pro Max with type C.
What a great phone stand, a cat😂
that mega......pixel pause was ROUGH
iphone x😃 iphone 11🙂 iphone 12😐 iphone 13😑 iphone 14😭 iphone 15☠
Did you and MKBHD plan to upload the videos at the same time?
The one thing i’m really concerning Bout is the decoloration issues.. how do you think?
I learn about the phone ,then get an excuse why I shouldn't buy it yet am just broke😅, android users hello😅
Never used to be an iPhone fan, but mrwhosetheboss can always hype something up, even if the review is negative
Action button the ultimate feature that no other phones in the past had...wow jus wow apple
Can i get a like from arun
iphone 15  looks good , i might swtich back to apple for the first time since iphone 4
Been waiting on this review.
waiting for s23 ultra vs iphone 15 pro max
Hey man Greta vid just preordered mine
İt is the same shit
Hell yeah ive been waiting day for this!
3:40 well something like this already exist in Samsung A and above series of phone
I'm still using a iPhone 7 (I don't know how I did) so I can't wait to receive my iPhone 15 pro max in october!
meh. I'm still keeping my iPhone 14 Pro Max, i'll upgrade if Apple will have a PROPER file manager .
The voice only effect is going to be massive for the construction industry. Guys won't need to leave the jobsite to talk on the phone (obviously when safe to use it) but I can't count the times I was near heavy machinery trying to make a call so I had to walk off the job wasting alot of them.
Stay strong, be positive. We all struggle sometimes.
900p, that was weird to hear😂 5:25
lets just appretiate how mu- BOT!!!!
1:29 Looks like a bixby button to be honest
2:28 Apple cannot do that bcz Sony have a patented camera button
My day definitely gets better when I go to YouTube and find a notification that mrwhosetheboss uploaded a video
Nice
I and many like me don't spot any differences with the naked eye. The features may be new, but the external design is....... Apple to the 11 pro max design be like:"never gonna give u up"
Yeah kinda disappointing that the iPhone 15 Pro doesn't get as much of an upgrade other than USB C, new chip and action button. It's just a smaller upgrade compared to the Pro Max. At least it's USB-C now 🤷🏻‍♂️
Appel hit the singularity for phones with the current technology.
i love how apple took it upon them to say they choose to put USB-C on the new iPhones, when really the EU made them change out the charge port or they were banning the sale of iphones due to their new USB-C standard
Much respect to @mrwhosetheboss, your videos are lit 👍👍
So apple could launch the slimmest gaming console someday 😮  Also apple would be so uncomfortable watching you charging an Android with an iphone😂
Does the iPhone 15 has pwm flicker display?
In my eyes 13 mini is so satisfied.. My wish
How did you use the controller on the phone!?
Personally, full fat games on phones is awesome, but it furthers the frustration generated by the lack of third party app stores. I own over 300 games on steam, I don't want to start buying them all on iPhone just to play them.
Ah, you are one of those insane people who tilt their phone to the right when switching to landscape mode.
There is a type C port; that's new.
I just want to see battery life vs S23 and vs 13pro/14pro
Still don't understand why it doesn't come with a charging plug, because it's less plastic to include it than selling apart. I don't like iphone as it has some nice features but without customization to make it feel like my phone and the high price, I'll stick to android.
Biased review
9:27 on the Samsung you have motion photo turned on. This does impact the processing time since it is recording a small 3-ish second video, and saving multiple formats(jpg, gif, and the video).
8:15 bro still is using Vodafone sim 😂😂😂😂 only Indian's will understand it.
That slim bezels is calling the curve screen soon in iPhone 😁
9:27 motion photo mode on in S23 ultra to show iphone faster As expected from a apple fan boy👌👌
7:51 💀 ☠️
Marks from the charging port....now I cannot stop thinking about /that/ scene, nor can I barely restrain my desire to joke about it. It's so cursed, yet ingrained in me. Almost disappointed I didn't see anyone else yet here in the comments alluding to it...
Come on Arun, give me one please. Support your supporters for a change!😅
Voice isolation is not a new feature. I am 100% sure. Rest assured amazing video as always
3:30 huh i swear voice isolation and wide spectrum has been there for ages 😂😂
Lmao 🤣
Man i love that color natural titanium or the pacific blue ❤ im upgrading the 15 pro max love the fact its going to have triple aaa games like resident evil 4 remake so i can play on the go 🔥
My dad took his s23 to work and after 3 days his camera zoom lens broke
5m 10kw 1.9£kl
woah thats crazy
I just love so much your videos❤❤❤❤
🥑
Save your money, nothing to see here.
The phones definitely look the same every year but I believe the stuff they're doing on the software side is definitely making it a new phone each year.
iphone uses wifi 6E, in china we use wifi 7.
Waiting for this❤❤
Apple has baked an shitty mobile it's not groundbreaking but telling everyone. here it is😢
Bro knew what he was doing💀 7:48
Idk who's buying these things anymore. Don't get me wrong, I used to wait in line for the new iPhone. But that was ten years ago. Now? They weigh fifty pounds and are twice as thick as a foldable phones iOS is straight up ugly; a boring grid of boxes that hasn't changed in twenty years, every menu is just a mess of endless blue text on black background like a website from 1996 The new features always fall into one of two categories: Implemented better elsewhere years ago *or* gimmicks that lack practical function USB is locked to speeds from *23 years ago.* Giant ugly notch in the screen still Glass front is manufactured to break No RCS support  I mean it goes on and on Idk who's still buying these things but thank you. Without you, my apple stock would plummet.
Popcorn ready
Much love to my Samsung Fold users💖
Nice Video Arun. I bought an Iphone 15 pro myself and watching this video makes me feel I didn't waste £1000 on it.
I will never buy an Iphone
Can anyone buy one for me, please? Thanks in advance
You question the placemnet of the action button, yet Apple have forced user to have apps in the least accessible location for ever! Its such a ridiculous place to start in top left of the screen, when we all hold our phones from the bottomu
2023 flagship phone that has still 60hz is such a deal breaker to me. At least they should've made it 90hz and called it R-motion means "regular motion. " just like in their pro model. They call it Pro-motion
I am an iphone 13 pro user but why am I not excited about the 15 pro max at all.
vid was 12 minuets up and im already watching it 🤣
Great video... this guy flies back and pumps out quality vids.. solid!
great video!
The iphone looks good so far , now they have started challenging both mi and Samsung in the practical zoom ranges
those like me who cant afford the new iphones gather here please
I maybe liked my own comment
Mmmm sorry, not a fan of the gloves on the unboxing, far too typical and made it feel more bland for me. However, even as an android user, I love your videos even this one! You and you're team are phone-...tastic! 😶
Me watching on my 5 year old budget Android phone 😎🍿🍿
I still wonder how a thief would react walking into his house and seeing technology EVERYWHERE🤣
I swear they look the same every year (almost)
Just One Thing That Lags And That Is MONEY 🤑😢
vodafone UK   LOL
Although I am a strong Android user, I am taken aback by what this new Iphone can do, like action button and literally playing console games! This is a game changer. And love your videos Arun.
love how there are so many comments saying how good the video is even though its not possible for anyone to have watched it through yet
Why do I have feeling that youtubers are paid off yo only review Pro and Pro Max models and nobody is talkong abouut Base model ?
finally proooooooo
3:34 the voice isolation thing isn’t new at all. I don’t use FaceTime but I do use Google meet a lot and I can access this very option on my IPhone SE the same way you did. The voice isolation thing has always been around in iPhones I guess Arun just took a while to find it
So, the main new things are: a new button that the power button already replaces, and a cable that doesn't even support the iPhone's speed. For a premium, 1500$-ish phone. And you can't even repair it if you break it.
Waiting for S24😊
He's definitely getting paid to say this
3 normal shots and 3 portrait shots and I let them decide which one they prefer, Arun is everyone's favourite Cameraman
Here in 12 minutes
Will the BOSS reply 😏?
Next level 🤡🤡
10/10 phone , finally a new intresting phone from apple
The fact that these content creators don’t say the truth that these phone companies are just doing the same thing every year, Samsung not excluded🤦‍♂️These phone companies should take sometime off so they can bring you something new
7:50 WHAT
I'm probably wayyy out of touch with current iPhones, as I still have just the iPhone 8plus, but I always use the volume buttons as the shutter buttons.. the action button looks like a great short cut for the 15 pro for your preferred camera mode, but the shutter seems kinda redundant unless, are the volume buttons no longer shutter buttons?
Apple created a product we all knew wouldn't be impressive years ago.  Yet they still made it.
iphone voice isolation isn't new though. it's also not a pro feature either
I am waiting for iphone made of Vibranium 😂
wow let's play AAA on phone screens. Impressive but I'll pass. Still great phones though.
A 19 minute video for iterative update for iphones but  no video in 2 years for Z fold series in 2 years because apparently they are not the future,  wow!
I think colour saturation in video need work.
Best content creator 🎉
im so scared whenever aruns throws the phone
Bro that 6:48 is AMAZING 😍😂💯.
is this guy sponsored by apple or what?
Milo be like: "why the heck am I the shooting subject here every time??" 😂😂
im switching from samsung to iphone 15 pro max thank for review
3gs iphone shape  revival when?
Wait I thought the 15 pro will only be shipped earliest by 22nd of this month?
there were 910 comments so i decided to make them 911
We got Rick rolled at 8:22
Man i love that color natural titanium or the pacific blue ❤ im upgrading the 15 pro max love the fact its going to have triple aaa games like resident evil 4 remake so i can play on the go 🔥
I before I watch this, I'd say they have paid you to make this review. When I watch, I might change my mind, because so far... na iPhone 14 pro+ be this
Ah yes the Iphone 12 4.0. How exciting.
His videos excites me more than a movie release! XD
Is this an early april fools joke?
Aah yes.. sorted for the next 20m 👍🏽
Well sony...
BWEAN
Put out da battery test🔋 plz 🙏🏼
HIRING !!!  looking for someone to take care of me financially, full-time
Here comes the apple fanboy.
most of this except the new USB C adapter do not matter to me, as I am not much of a camera person. The action button seems cool tho.
Apple sheep
Can you please shoot your videos in HDR. It is looking colour washed on iPad Pro
OMG I WAS WAITING FOR THIS, im watching this at school 🌚🌚
Im so happy arun is back doing phones ,he is best in it ,the gadgets thing is crap and doesn't work for him
tbh at this point just get an hp victus with 32gb ram,  rtx 3050 and i5
Isn't voice isolation more like audio focus of samsung? Just pointing out
WHY ARE YOU GETTING BALD LOL?
10 minutes gang
Amazing video Arun! Unlike most tech youtubers who will just lay down the specs and say them out he actually makes it fun and not making you feel like you are taking in "knowledge" 🔥🔥💎💎
The titanium frame is the biggest selling point for me, and from what I've heard, S24 going to copy the titanium frame
Can i have the iphone 15 🎉😢
👋👋👋
As a person who used Iphone 13 I see this as an absolute loss (stupid type c change)
9mins later after the upload from Malaysia! But daymn already 558 comments 🥲😌
Bruh 9 mins 34k views 😂
Arun never fails to rickroll us in the most unexpected way possible 😂
The s23 ultra 5g has a 200mp camera still😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4:54 i really love how he used his cat instead of a stand💀💀
To summarize it all,no huge difference from the iPhone 14 series🤦, don't waste your money guys.
Samsung bros 🔥🔥
ayyy early
Arun, this video is not helping you beat Apple in subscribers
noice
Ronaldo better than Messi
I cant defend you Aaron... this phone leaves a little more to be desired
Hi
❤❤❤👏🏽🫵🏼🫡🤛🏽🇧🇩🖐️🇮🇹
Some people just buy new iPhone just for one more camera or new lenses, I prefer Samsung
It sounds like you're trying to save apple a*s more than apple trying to save it's own a*s😂 !The truth is that apple didn't delivered this year... I am an "all life long" Android user, and my plan was to give the iPhone chance this year as my first Apple product ever, but... Apple fu*ked up😢...Such a dirty game from Apple 🍎....
7:50 ayo chill
It’s just crazy how good phones are getting these days. I love your videos Arun, well done!
Buy me 1 then
phone rule, when using the camera horizontally, the camera should always be on the left side. i dont make the rules. just seeing it on the right side at 2:04 is just, makes me uncomfortable
APPLE is garbage
Oh my god I love your videos so much ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
How much apple paid you...
Ordered my White Pro Max and they told that they wouldnt be shipped soon...so..pre order on the shop the minute it was available and need to wait 2 months to get it..rip
please sponsor me a phone
I'm being honest 15pm is titanium stove and 14pm is stainless steel stove (I'm using 14pm rn)
Boring am keeping my iPhone 7😢
Still waiting for your review on new Huawei phone 😊
All the iphones you've bragged about I've used them and I gotta say they're just meh, camera wise? Dude iphone cameras are nowhere near flagship androids, let alone Samsung
Ppl with typical American attitude only will buy I phone now
Aruuun got paid in full
Do he want to be a relaxing unboxer??
Have you guys noticed something that Arun also referred to the Samsung S23 Ultra in his review video as "better than you think". Does this mean something? If so, then what?
POV: when u realise apple ain't releasing a flip phone anytime sooner. Who hopes apple does ✌
Other than releasing a new phone  They should have gone for a software update
Can't afford right now but one day i will😊
Watched the whole video it was amazing!
No it's not
Who else had no clue that the back tap feature existed
IT'S FINALLY HEREEE! I'M GETTING IT!
About 4 hours before the iPhone 15 could be pre-ordered, I saw someone with  the iPhone 15 on the bus and I was utterly blown away.  The reason I knew it was an iPhone 15 was because it had the dynamic island and only 2 lenses on the camera bump. I still don't know how the hell they got it about 5 days before anyone was supposed to be able to even buy it
apple tv dock with active cooling when?
You should also do a 1 month or 6 months after use review so you can undiscovered more feature and more of its pros and cons and how is it like to live with
Why very little things that are there in Android many updates or years ago look interesting & new & innovation type?? Really??
Android>>
Trisha kinda looks like Mia khalif-
This man ALWAYS delivers 📱
Can we just take a moment to respect this guy he puts so much effort into his videos keep it up man.
im thinking about changing from android to iphone. Right now im using a xaomi note 9 and i wonder if i should get a iphone 12 or save a little and get a iphone 11 or 11 pro
I got the kleenex ready
Why all you big youtubers upload video the sametime mrwhosetheboss.mkbhd.etc so notification i was receive the sametime.
25 k views in just 5 mins  Thats Mr WHOSETHEBOSS
How long did it take you to get Milo to act like a phone stand for you 😂😂
Wow nice
Action Button as a Shutter in 2023.  Apple Fans : Wow So Cool. Lumia 900 in 2012: Hi
The truest tech reviewer in existence ❤
I will never get pinned
Might consider to change to iPhone
Been waiting for your review!! Finally!!
Yooo 🤘🤘🤘 plz pin me 💗
Y u everytime appreciate apple
Arun and marques  dropping same time ❤
nice vid man!!
Great video as always! Keep it up Arun❤
Love the thumbnail!!!
I got KFC rice ready LOL
Why not get a DSLR?
😄😄😄 how much did Apple pay you to try to sell people on this new Old phone! 😄
iuui
can someone buy me the iPhone 15 pro max
Nice 🎉❤
I am waiting for s23 ultra vs 15 pro max camera bettel
hehey
Hi aryan ! Can you suggest us to upgrade this apple phone 📱
I can already tell that we must need a comparison video between Samsung S23 Ultra and the IPhone 15 Pro Max
Bro don't hype it too much...already overrated. Now a days you sound too conventional
Voice isolation is an iOS 16 thing... It's not new? iOS 16.3 also enabled it for cellular calls too.
No thanks. Ill stick with my Oppo find X6 pro which blows this nonsense outta the water 🤷🏽‍♂️😂
i actually knew that iphone 15 was going to be better than i think. ( should i still watch the video or not )
Feels like a life decision when Mrwhosetheboss and MKBHD release at the same time...
Arun with yet another banger!!
Overrated I don't think so Underrated I think so
4:42 what do do with that power? what about running at lower clocks to save on battery life?
Hey Aaron
bangladeshi ra assalamuolaikum number of bangladeshi watching this  ✋
I didn’t know there was a back tap button
Me too i have a popcorn
Hey Arun. If you got your hands on a mate 60 series can you do a review on it? Thanks!
I'm ur fig fan  sir great job❤❤
Look at the view count 😅
HOW DO YOU HAVE THE PHONE?!?
At this point we can all agree that even tech youtuber like MKBHD and even arun are getting paid by apple Even as an Iphone user  All these youtuber are too baised toward iphone
I will never be able to buy an iPhone in my life. But definitely take some tips from Arun about the iphone. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤So that  I can tell others that I know about the iphone. 😂😂😂
Who's with me, So fun to watch a phone that i cannot afford in 3 years time. 😐
🎉
Oh almost first Welp Mrwhosetheboss can you give a review over the Samsung A14? (Not 5G) I want to buy one but i dont know if its good and i only trust you. I hope you can anyway Thanks!
Shazzzz annnnaaaa
😔 arun is being bias now. There is nothing new except usb c...apple ran out of ideas long time ago. Those features were introduced with android long long time ago.
I cant wait to watch this review of the Iphone 14!!! 😮
Hey arun
50000 views in 15 minutes? Damn.
The fact that the non Pro iPhone 15 still has a 60Hz display in 2023 is crazy! The non Pro iPhone 16 better have a 120Hz display or at least a 90Hz one!
Bezels look great 🔥
It's crazy how MKBHD and Mrwhosetheboss  both posted something about the iPhone 15 at the same time
All the tech reviewers try too hard to d*ckride Apple. The inherent bias towards it is quite evident 😂😂 Btw good video as usual.
I think I should not watch this videos. it looks like I'm gonna buy it as soon as the video end🤣
Hi
Hi
My second kidney: “Don’t even think about it”💀
I just think this video is for content only. there's very little reason to upgrade to this. not even the cameras are worth it.
w
cant wait, pre ordered the 15 pro max, BLUE titanium 256Gb!! Hyped af lol
Lets Go!
Alternative Title: Iphone 14 pro Review
Arun can I have one 😂
Just hold your 14pro max and upgrade next year
Love watching this at lunch! :)
Has anyone noticed Arun's hairline slowly going backwards 💀
Was this an YouTube video or a freaking cinema?
your an amazing yter
How did you get them?
Finally
Ready to watch despite definitely not buying 😂
Waiting for this for so longgggggggggggggggggg
Hi big fan
Slayyyyy
Nice ❤❤❤❤
Cool
Apple proprietary usb type c 😂
Smartphones are getting boring
Though I cannot buy an iPhone I really love his reviews, really genuine
How to get paid from Apple 101
even if it was terrible people would still buy it just because it's got a apple logo 😂
One of the first comments 😊😂❤
Finally ❤️
Hello Bro
Who is watching this video holding Samsung A10💀
For all teenagers, you are incredible
But voice isolation is in my iOS 16 13 pro as well? 🧐
Do you and Marques plan to post exactly at the same time cos?.😂😂😂
Bro needs his TV show
USB-C. 'nuff said
Literally searched this up for no reason and got it 5mins ago uploaded
nice
This video is going to be a banger!
Command-C, Command-V.  Here, Tim.
10k views in 3 minutes is batshit insane !!!😱😱
I think it is the biggest jump in from 11 to 12❤
No one has watched this video fully yet.
You get similar cable set for iPad Pro sets.
I just see people congratulating how the video is, but the real deal is that you are trying so hard to justify production, how do you expect people to pay attention to little when they are not tech guru. People want to see major visual and physical news that can differentiate 14 from 15 and not what apple just released
Too much mony
I GOT THE SNACKS TIME TO WATCH
Why don't iPhones ever play hide and seek?  Because they always stand out with their "apple-solutely" distinctive design!
You're are best ❤❤❤❤
10k views in 5 mins holy that’s so good
Been watching since 2019(from when I was 10) love your content!
Your one the 1st to do this
Voice isolation is not a new feature for iOS though??
I love your videos❤
✨Most awaited video on this channel is here 🎉
Aruns transition to becoming an Apple fanboy 😂😂😂
4 minutes and already about 300 comments 😯😯😯😯😯
Me here after. 0.0001 second after notification. 😅
bro iphone 15 is a thousand bucks, for that i could get a good pc, a good phone, a good tablet, and a nintendo switch lite. this is a joke
They should have really called it... iPhone 14C...14plus C ....14 pro C and 14 pro max C 😂
No fast charging mood totally disappointed 😔
Yo
I will miss silence switch ☹️ one of the reasons why I like iPhone
Amazing video😊😊😊
Let's go ❤❤❤
Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩🩷
I've been waiting for this 👌
The Iphone 15 looks promising
hi
We have been waiting for this. Thanks, Arun. As always on point and top-notch review without redundant tidbit.
4 mins
yayy arun here!
Android user gather here and see how useless iphone is 😅
The one big defining feature is USB-C.
Thanks for posting this on my birthday 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄👍👍👍👍
glad to contribute the first dislike :)
Love brudda❤
Let's goooooo
Android Laughing in Corner 😂

BRO HOWW ARE THERE SO MANY COMMENTS ALREADYYYYYYYY
Amazing video Arun! Unlike most tech youtubers who will just lay down the specs and say them out he actually makes it fun and not making you feel like you are taking in "knowledge"
love the vids
Pov u tryna get pinned
Same shit different name
Iphone becomes more and more Android.... I stich witg the original. I stick with my Galaxy
I clicked so fastttt, love ur vids mann!
and half of the features was *titanium*
Better than you think.  Also: you NEED to buy this more than you think. And also: it´s more expensive than you hope.
1:11 This is the same for every android phone. Every android phone also ships with a USB 2.0 cable
My 300 dollar samsung also has voice isolation
Lol
I had voice isolation before but i an not sure if it was AirPods feature or iphone one
Hi
First
S23 ultra vs iPhone 15 pro max camera test
I remember the collab video Arun and Marques from MKBHD had, and the dual embargo for this iPhone release has shown how aggressive apple is to lock in as many consumers in their ecosystem. Never would have imagined this move from apple...
So excited
iPhone 15 pro more like iPhone 15 no
At this point, not even Arun can change my mind on the IPhone
We need Iphone15 regular review too
I didn’t like my comment 🗿🗿
Iphone 15 pro max vs samsung zflip5 please
iphone 15:
oh god i was just looking in notifications and this came 😁😁😁😁
how come apple still going?

For the first time In history First view in your video Love from 🇧🇩
Was Pretty Disappointed with the release of the iphone 15 pro/max but maybe it's not that bad
Hi everyone 👋👋
Voice isolation is not a new feature. It is there even in my iPhone 13🤷‍♂️
Need a phone badly
People on their way to comment amazing vid after 1 minute:
👀👀
This is the best iPhone yet but the price tag still wants to go up as you could expect😅
just watched the video. It was pretty good
the iphone 15 looks so nice
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I just don’t like the dynamic island stuff because it just looks out of place and I would probably like the idea better if you could swipe up and get rid of it
Wow, Thank you. I thought it was bad but know it is good? like if you agree
Thank you for another wonderful review!
480hz pwm is still not enough 😅 it will definitely hurt your eyes
Me who can't buy even iPhone 8 till now🤣

Sell your house for an Iphone 15😂
Never been that early

Just waiting for this video 💗
hi
Awesome video, keep it up
i love your vid
love the content arun!
They definitely are starting to make the phones look the same every year but I believe the stuff they're doing backend software wise is definitely making it a new phone each year. However the caveat with that is it doesn't really entice you to want to buy it.
1 hour gang here
First to comment. Send me a free iPhone . Real values like your videos 😊. It’s my birthday

The only thing different from the iPhone 14 Pro, IS THE PRICE!!

You are too bias… Obviously they are paying you to say mostly pros and not the reality that they are releasing the same phone for the last 5 years.
