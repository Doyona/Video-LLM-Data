1. Have Sincerity and Fortitude in the QUR'AN, it will be the guide  to "our" successful release. From the many Veils of Darkness's 😈. (Read It Daily)
This shit lowkey SLAPS on .75% playback speed. It gives off a different vibe, but I fuck with it for sure. It's interesting, original speed is best but tbh I really like the .75 playback speed too, it comes across as more deliberate, and more emphasis on the bars/rhymes. I would recommend trying it at least once‼️💯😅
This that 2013 Almighty!!!!!!
Chief keef will forever be one of the goats
🔥🔥🔥🔥

We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9

"We don't hit Walmarts, we hit targets" 🔥🔥 .. 🤣🤣 the bar comes from when Takahashi 69 sent Kooda nem to shoot at Keef while they was in New York .. Sosa nem was standing outside the hotel and Kooda nem pulled up and shot at the top of the building(So nem was literally on the ground level right in front of them) .. that's why he say "we don't hit wall marks(Walmart), we hit targets(the opp)" if you gon shoot then shoot pussy

All of these forms of entertainment will be forgotten once you die. Where you spend eternity after death is all that matters. Jesus Christ died for the sins of humanity and rose up on the third day and while his name is used as a curse word in modern day society, God is mot mocked. At the end of the world every knee shall bow and ever tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and he is the King of Kings. Jesus will give you peace while everyone is depressed and living in misery, Jesus will give you hope when the world feels like all hope is lost. Jesus Christ loves you and wants you to have a relationship with him. Pick up a kjv Bible and read the new testament first and the old testament after. Repent and seek Jesus before it is too late.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I cant post enough fye emojis to do this justice 🤦🏽‍♂️

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot. 2. Sometimes I wake up grumpy; other times I let her sleep. 3. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it. 4. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges. 5. Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway. 6. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 7. Humpty Dumpty was pushed. 8. National Atheist's Day April 1st. 9. All generalizations are false. 10. I can handle pain until it hurts.  Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Aint too many ***** round he who steppin so they know who done it😈😈😈🔥🔥 yakk on fyyee rn no doubt bout that

Instant classic ‼️
This crap promoted to be idolized and ats working on these 🐑🐑🐑🐑 roaming earth 😂
This is what tha rap scene needed...new unexpected collabs
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .

The og Sosa and the king of Florida together! Fire
Jesus Christ the most loving king to all of mankind came down from His heavenly glory became flesh and died and was resurrected from the dead by God to save us from the wages of our sin,so that for whosoever should believe in Him,acknowledging with ur mouth Jesus is Lord,believing with ur ❤️ that He was raised from the dead and would call upon his name and turn of sins would be justified/saved and freed with assurance everlasting life in Jesus name!Time is short!God bless y’all !♥️♥️
When the video drops can we play it on our TV show?

Damn, Sosa did his thang! Didn't think he can rap at alllllllll!
The real 🐐 of Chicago has awoken from his slumber
They definitely need to drop a music video to this
Playing dumb acting like I’m slow just to see who fast 🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/XX8onNcB-cQ
Let me now remind you of the Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I tell you . I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said. He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.

You have two hands.  One to help oneself and the other to help others.   10.  Helping others is the fare of being in your world.  So don’t be arrogant about it.   11.  Helping someone may not change the world, but it can change that person.   12.  Today I found that if you want to love someone, you have to bring out the best version of him by helping him and not by changing him.

Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                            ,/., /. ./, , /                   /.,/.,./ ,/                       ,/. ,/. ,/. , ,.,./,
