Why didn’t they show any of the scores? It was like 40 to 3 Show it, this was Bill Bellichicks worse loss ever and his only loss to Dallas, Cowboys also gave Tom Brady his worse loss and only loss to Dallas and in the playoffs, Tom Brady’s last game ever! Double revenge
LFGGGGGGGG
I WANT OUR Zeke back on our Dallas Cowboys teams  You hear me. ITS TOO COLD IN NEW ENGLAND
Not going to lie, Zack hugging Zeke got me crying. Damn I miss Zeke 🥲
Zeke will never be denied love from cowboys nation, honestly hope he signs a 1 day and retires a cowboy at the end of his journey..
Zeke should still be a cowboy 😢
when i see dak i tell my dad look my boy friend
Cowboys love Zeke still
ZEKE!! 🥲🥲🥲🥲 forever a Cowboy
I better see Zeke in the Ring of Honor.
Looking up at the screen is how fans in the stadium watch the game too.
Most people think they *know football* if the Cowboys put up a poll asking Dallas fans "one has to go, the other stays" Hunter Luepke vs Luke Schoonmaker. Even though it's the wrong answer, the fans would clearly vote for Hunter over Luke and *MANY* others
❤❤❤❤
Bring Zeke back 😢
Where is the video from the 9ers game?
When you gonna drop sounds for sf vs dallas? Asking for 9ers friend
😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉
So whack they only do mic’d up on the wins..
0:14 what type of a laugh was that???
Now we see why Micah was looking like that the whole video. He knew we were playing the 49ers that next week, and we was gonna get exposed. He just felt it.
CD and Micah’s body language is almost identical
Zack hugging zeke made me tear up
🙏🏾 Let's gooooo! We are Stars! No negative energy towards US! I'm on fanduel... ... ... keeping it gangsta! Fanduel is the reason why other betting system or apps are losing, as well. I picked the fan's favorite NCAA teams... (All ranked teams... Miami loss! Smh... Miami was one of the teams I didn't think was going to lose nor USC to Arizona...
We should use more FullBack plays in the red zone
Parsons was acting like a lil bitch during this game.
Am I the only one who notice how every sound from sideline we see the youngins on the team go crazy
Nah seeing Micah not saying a word is crazy I feel like he locked in rn💯
Got a little choked up at end seeing zeke and his boys hugging
Bland is him
Love seeing that love to zeke but he had to take that booty whooping
Zeke was happier than a kid in a candy store. 😆
Zeke is still part of our family! We miss him sooo much! Zeke belongs in Dallas! Bring Zeke back!!!!!!! DC4L!!!!!!!!
How did a thumbnail from sounds from the sidelines make me 😢. I miss you for real thou Zeke.
First time I never heard one word from parsons in one of these....
Comments were on point. The Zeke love at the end was everything!
Still love you Zeke!!!
He's a mountain west guy "we ain't hearing that he's a cowboy"
I almost cried at the end
Zeke should still be a cowboy 😢😢
I’m starting to really dislike these videos. Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s fascinating being in the midst of the sidelines during games. But I’m starting to feel as if this is just another unnecessary way for Jerry Jones to promote the Cowboys. The boom microphone over the bench is what brings it over the top. It’s just unnecessary distraction for a team that needs to be hungry and focused and this just takes away from it.
“We’re not hearin’ that man!”
Seeing that pic it's very clear, they are going to have fun spending that chek  Jerry Jones wrote to the pats!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Zeke wants to be at home 😭 you can tell he doesn’t want to be where he is
Miss Zeke man
Damn I miss zeke just come back 😢
I was at this game, ELECTRIC
Ferguson needs to become Ferguson in this next game. He had all the tools to be a great tightend.  I'm calling Witten, and  novacek up this season. I think he can be an all time great tightend especially for the cowboys but mainly league
All I can say I that real men tell eachother “I love you”
I literally almost started CRYING LIKE A LITTLE GIRL when Zack Martin & Zeke started hugging 😭😭 you could see the love between them like brothers. 💙
Even though he’s not the same feed me Zeke I still got much love and respect for 21….
I miss Zeke being in a Cowboys uniform. 😢
I hate to say it but Micah parsons just acted like he did not want to be out there playing.  Bro was just going through the motions had no fire behind him.  I know he hurt his ankle but it was before that.   He just seemed pisses off and like he didn’t want to play
Even though I am a Cowboys fan, I started feeling bad for the patriots so I stopped watching 💀💀💀
Bro if zeke doesn’t just take the pay cut and come back for the chip 😢
I think we should tell new england...we'll give you a 5th round pick....you cover half of zekes contract and he comes Home. Only sound feoml the sideline that makes me sad. Zeke wasnt worth what he was being paid  but its almost as sad as watching Emmitt Smith play for the cardinals . Also...Dak took that sack like a MAN.
I love the way they have been ending these. Keep it up
Same I felt so sad seeing zeke 😭
“Damn that’s probably the easiest pick you’ll ever have” is evidence enough mac jones sucks and will be cut in off-season
Lamb: He's a cowboy ❤ ....let's fucking go!!!!
Zeke made me cry. I felt the emotion 😢.
That screen going dark on D'Law's embrace with Zeke followed by "Love, Man" is a nice touch. Hit me right in the feels. Well made!
Zeke cut his hair and beard,,,, he really is a PATRIOT now!!!!!  EEEWWW😢
That boy trey lance happy to be wit the boys ya love to see it. hopefully he stays for the future
San Francisco by 24 come back to this comment
D LAW WHAT IT DO BOYYYYYY
D Law, Martin, and Kearse are some dawgs.
Zeke will always be a Cowboy. He will come back and sign and retire a Cowboy. How bout them Cowboys 😀👍🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
Zeke should come back to retire 21 jersey
5:03 💀
If you didn’t shed at least one tear at the end when Zeke hugged all of the boys, you ain’t a real Cowboy fan, love you Zeke #21 will always be yours!
I love how they were able to accurately translate each curse word 😂
Man seeing Zeke reunite with his brothers brought tears to my eyes. It’s just the type that your heart hated to see him go but your brain knew we had to move on. Thank you for those 2016-2018 memories Zeke!
Come on cowboys beat the 49ers revenge time
Awe, Zeke!! I think everyone came over to greet him. 😢 Miss you Zeke.
Bitter Sweet for sure!! They all legit liked Zeke 💯
We went out to eat 🔥😎
Was it me or was Micha Parsons Not being his normal self? He seemed upset all game long.
Seek should still be a cowboy he’s better than every rb we got other than TP
I just gotta say kudos to the guys eho edit these. The (captions) always have me rolling 😂😂😂
Damn Im happy with our RBs but it was emotional seeing Zeke showing love at the end
I know Micah be locked in on the bench but something's not right about his body language
Them Dallas Cowboys are too great love my team 🏈💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👍👍👍👍👍👍
I love the way the team/staff shared love with brutha Zeke! They miss his locker room Energy.  His play on the field has just greatly decentergrated!
Hardest thing was seeing Zeke not in a cowboy uniform. That man is a cowboy forever.
Micah seemed like he didn't want to hear anything DLaw said, I've been trained to read body language and his said it all, he didn't need no words. When D Law turned to speak to him face to face he instantly turned hus shoulders and face away from DLaw and never even acknowledged a word had been said to him. Compare that to the way the rest of teh team was interacting??? Something strange going on there. Not sure what but something for 100% sure. The rest of the video was great, but that stuck out like a sore thumb.
What’s up with Parsons buddy seem off
I miss zeke
Dem Boyz looked good out there.  You gotta love Coach Harris, but the icing on the cake was the BROTHERLY love at the end! Priceless! Nothing but love for Zeke!
We need Zeke back 😢
Micah is ALL business on the sideline high key in all for it though
is it just me or did micah look sad that whole game
Zeke will forever have a special place in my football heart ❤
Hurts my soul seeing Zeke in that ugly jersey.
every time they show micah he is fucking PISSED he was not having it
I find it a little funny how the cowboys players are hyping each other up every game like "Let's kick this team's ass" or whatever, but it has to feel awkward when you end up losing lol, glad they actually did dominate this game though.
make these (beautiful) videos LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONGER
I wished he would of stayed in Dallas
Damn that hurt seeing Zeke at the end he deserve me to be here
😢yep
Zeke said he😊😊😊 almost   this jersey off that's what he told D P😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤
I love the show but the players seem done with this  during every game 😅 time to switch it up twin
Man I know this burning Diggs up
Jerry will find a way to bring Zeke back to close out his career. Count on it.
It’s not the same without Zeke. Miss that dude.
Bro seeing Zeek after the game interacting with his former team just puts this FKn not in my throat 😢 smh
Need this offense to start scoring TDs
There's still a lot of love for Ezekiel. Get out there Is Zeke Elliott? I won't forget what you did for the cowboys. Love you, man so good, it's all good football.
Thats right he’s a Mount west guy!! Go Dogs!!
Way to make a grown woman cry 😭😭 love my boys! Zeke! Wishing you the best ❤️
Bring zeke home
Seeing Zeke at the end made me sad again 😢😢😢😢
I still cant believe Israel Mukwamu isnt playing more
The end made me cry like a mf
Parsons didn’t say anything
Is it just me or did Micah look pissed that he wasn’t getting to the QB? that’s that lion mentality. Love his competitive spirit
We still love you Zeke
Who is 46 never seen him before and seeing Zeke back makes me sad
Is nobody going to talk about 5:02  or…? Because I was rolling 😭
Jerry kept Emmitt as long as he could. If Zeke would have won a Super Bowl, he would still be a Star.
Defense caring the offense once again! Redzone offense really need to get shit together
When zac hugged zeke 😢! Brought a lil tear. You can tell they are friends for life
Martin and Zekes hug hit the hardest. The love an elite IOL has for his rb and vice versa is something else.
Bland is a baller. 💯
Zeke don’t look right on the patriots man …
When they tell Zeke to keep his head up and ask if he’s good and healthy….😢
At the end I wasn’t crying something was in my eye
This one for ZEKE
I knew the end would give me tears 😅
We got that superbowl mentality baby
seeing the love between zeke and the boys really warmed my heart, they all looked so happy to see each other
Can we get Zeke back? 🖤🥲
I got teary at the end love seeing this the love they have for Zeke and each other just Amazing Team right there.
Can’t wait to see what Micah does next week… he cruised this week. Didn’t even look like he was there.
Jerry really be taking over the sounds of the sidelines cover pic
I went to the game and boy u could feel the love in the air for Zeke I was going to wear his Dallas jersey but bought my girl and I a parsons Jersey
I miss zeke man
Bland is a fuckin dawg!!
Everyone missed Zeke and watching the game you could tell what side of the field he wanted to be on regardless of who was winning.
Why did I have to start slicing onions when Zeke showed up...😢
Zeke has really grown up. It's touching to see that his teammates lining up to show him love. Glad he found a home - he's still got some game left.
Nothin but love Zeke  How bout them Cowboys!
It hurts not seeing Zeke with the cowboys
I wanted to see zeke again outside of kellens play design and tendencies. The business end of things just didn’t work out with him. The cowboys should not have let him ever hold out and worked a more affordable deal ahead of time. Great blocker great team mate. With the price of even an average qb nowadays there’s just not enough leftover to dump into a running back. Try to imagine salary wise who they would be missing if they had to pay zeke this year. Shitty situation, probably could’ve been handled better.
Also.. those hugs at the end of the game with Zeke... 💔😭 Dak, Leighton, D-law and Martin... makes me freaking sad. Zeke was the work horse and got shipped out to pasture. ( in my opinion, dont come at me hahaha 💯💙)
So much love for zeke.
Bring zeke back 😢
Heeeey LV 🐺.... Touchdown! Love it! 💯🙌💙🏈
The Zeke love in the comments is hilarious, his 20 yards a game isn't missed.
Zeke may go down as my favorite cowboy, such an enjoyable player to cheer for! Loved by every teammate
am i the only one scared by how quiet parsons is
All those hugs and words to Elliot. I miss him too. Bittersweet. Awesome win Cowboys!
MICAH DIDNT LOOK TO HAPPY OUT THERE. EVEN IGNORING LAWRENCE
Hope zeke can come home somehow
Even though we was winning. Micah looked mad or upset about sum most of the game. D law was talking to him and parsons looked frustrated about sum
My favorite part is Lamb saying “He a COWBOY” !!! && can we please talk about how McKeon saved the day with the fumble recovery.
Martin and Zeke hug.. rough… 😢
Number 11 was to quiet.. hope he makes up for it this week (49ers)
Those last few seconds with Zeke. 😢
Much love for the Zeke-Aleek ji ji we miss him no matter what <3 .... we dem boys
Zak deffo had a special connection with Zeke man😢
Coach Harris is the jewel of this Defense . . . everyone is talking Dan Quinn . . . nah . . Coach Harris man
Micah energy during this win was way low, everytime he was on camera he looked annoyed
5:02 white women jump scare lmao
You can tell Zeke is still a Cowboy at heart… damn I hate seeing him in another jersey.
I love it❤... Wedemboyz
There is simply a level of respect from one man to another man once those men have served together in war & combat, as there are no words. Just the amount of respect & admiration shown to Zeke states more than words can fathom. 🍻✊🏻👏🏻🙏🏻🍻
Man I wish NE would cut Zeke so we can bring him back and get him a ring this year 😭
Every week I look forward to these videos they are the best!
Parsons looks like he ain't having any fun out there. Hopefully next game is better for him.
I swear I almost cried just seeing how much the team loves and miss him😞
✭ WƎ DƎM BOYS ✭
Wasn’t intending on crying in the end 😢
Zeeeeeeeeke 💙
Gotta love them Boyz yesssir DC NATION FOR LIFE
Hey Leighton stop paying attention to the film crew and pay attention to your assignments. You look old and slow! Dare I say old Sean Lee?
teary eyesss with 21 mann 😢
I was hoping to see Zeke and Pollard. Aside from the Dak and Zeke friendship, I feel like Zeke and Pollard were the next closest buds.
Yall focused on the wrong things... pay attention to Parson's. Dude is different physically, but mentally he's on a different level. Dare I say it, MJ and Kobe-esque.
Awww we miss you Zeke!❤❤❤
Sounds of the sideline after a lossss!!!!!! Pleaseeeee
Super Corny Not Doing The Ari One Win Lose Or Draw These Need To Drop
THEM BOYS!
I see our own media team is buying in to the "hate dak narrative". Why wasn't the fade to ceedee in this video, 🤔
Y’all praise zeke like he was maxing I’m a cowboys fan and realistically he was only really good his first 2 seasons maybe the 3rd as well don’t remember but after that he began a 3 yard rusher so glad he’s gone but wish him the best
Why put this bowl of onions here ??😢
Love it!
I do miss him brooo 😢🥲 but hey! He’s healthy! All that matters! 😎💯
Zeke 😢
The ending with zeke was wholesome. He misses us and we miss him 💯 maybe we'll win 2 superbowls and bring him back for the second 😎
Sad seeing zeke in a patriots uniform 😢
Man if only zeke would’ve restructured his contact he’d be a cowboy for sure
The love for Zeke, 🥺😭
Damn it's messed up seeing Zeke in another uniform but I like the way they all gave him love at the end of the game I know he felt some type of way being on the other side of it but they picked him up just like I did I wore my Zeke jersey to pay tribute to all he did for us and I miss him shout out to Zeke keep eating brah once a Cowboy always a Cowboy
I love Marco Murray Marion Barber and Felix Jones etc but Zeke Just hit a little different leaving the Cowboys man 😢
Damn I'm a grown man and watching Zeke hug everybody at the end really brought tears to my eyes.
Zeke should still be a cowboy!! We could’ve gave him the same contract
Miss you Zeke 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Man seeing how the players looked at zeke. Says a lot.
what a great guy....can tell how much he is loved.
i definitely see Zeke retiring as a Cowboys (like DeMarcus Ware did)
I hated to see him go, but after he got that contract, like so many others before him, he let himself go. Came into training camp fat and out of shape, couldn't produce on the field all season. Jerry didn't want to let him go, but he had to.
Dang, Parsons didn’t have very good energy this game. Not sure if he was upset about getting banged up or what.
When Zek retires Jerry Jones should let him suit up and retire as a Cowboy!
good win but sad not having Zek out there with us!  All the best to you Zek!
Terd Ferguson sighting cool n all but Zeek was bust part at and.
Luke schoonmaker was such a wasted pick. We did not need a TE in the 2nd round there.
I almost teared up at the end 🥹 We miss you, Zeke. Thanks for everything.
Still love for Zeke 💯
Parson act like he was mad
Anyone cutting onions at the end. 😢😢😢
Nice to see that stupid bum zeke Finally cut his hair and doesn't look like a homeless idiot anymore.
Micah seemed quiet, maybe he was dealing with his injury? Hopefully he will be good to go this sunday
Man... the ending had me tore up from the floor up. Still love you Zeke.
5:02 SURPRISE
Can we get Zeke back on a friendly deal 😢
PUKESCOTT really say all day?? What a fuc*in GOOF. one td for the O on a pass ONE
https://youtu.be/GR3iVhhe5ng?si=C0VpIkHmclYn3tmF
I swear I felt like crying watching Zeke at the END!
Diggs got some good help when Gilmore leaves
Just my opinion,  but I think we shoulda resign zeke at the veteran rate, and had let dowdle to the practice squad, with pollard zeke holding down the rb position,  and for those with snappy comebacks, I'll be keeping my day job
Good (stuff) out there my (good buddies)! Lets whoop some 9ers (behind) next!
😀😎🥶👍💯
I would like to hear the sounds of the games we lose not just the wins
This team ran by guy Zeke into the ground his first 3 sessons! He lead the league in rushing until the injuries.
Zeke will always be a Cowboy! You see how happy he was? and "his team" lost! Lol 😂 How 'bout them Cowboys!
He's a COWBOY 😊
Shit azz zeke
Wait every week for this!
Zeke would make a difference in the end zone for us
I'm so glad I got to see this,Zeke has such a beautiful smile! I really loved how he and Zack embraced! Loved watching the game! We miss you Zeke, Blessings Always 🙏
Aww, Zeke!  Also, I’ve never seen Micah so quiet.
I hate the end. Yes, I do  #21. We miss  u ❤️ ❤❤
Man what's up with Parsons man, ever since the beginning of the Cardinals game I've seen his energy not the same. He's not as happy/energetic like the first 2 games. I hope he's ok, he's definitely one of the reasons we'll make it to SB.
The cowboys running game isnt that good....If the patriots start to clean house and let ZEK go...Cowboys need to pick him up if another back goes down
Still all love zeke 💙
Remember like a week ago when it was all "redzone redzone redzone".  Well...  Let's see how they make us headlines all week this week again since the media only talks about the cowboys 24/7.
Love the foreshadowing of the CB coach tellin Bland to lock in! #DC4L
We ready to battle the niner lesko cowboys
I'd like to see them play like that this Sunday night
SEE YOU GUYS NEXT WEEK 🇧🇸🇧🇸🇧🇸DC4L
Seeing Zeke in that Patriots uniform hurt 😭❤️. It just doesn't look right. Like when Emmitt was a Cardinal.
That bond between zeke and zack is all love he protected him when he was just a kid getting hunted by grown ass men, that’s a bond they’ll never loose and why I love sports so much 🤝❤️
Anyone know when Israel Mukuamu coming back? Dudes a stud to it’s a damn shame cowboys aren’t using him .
The respect these boys showed Elliott just shows how loved he was in that locker room.
Man that ending was sad ngl
Michael persons wasn't feeling it that day
We gotta start playing Luepke in the redzone
Lmao the beginning funny. Love my team !
man i wish zeke could've stayed. I don't know what happened behind doors or how much money cowboys offered vs others. at end of the day, yes it is a business but damn.
It's good to see love among Cowboys.
Cowboys look so close as a team, defense on the sideline look like a bunch of kids just having fun, that is the difference
I thought Zeke was going to start crying when he was hugging Zack kinda tough
Love the end with all of our players embracing Zeke. The embrace with Zack Martin was extra special, because he was instrumental in helping Zeke get paid 🤑
Seeing zeke at the end almost made me cry ! 🥺
6:12 who let that child on the field? Jk but it's crazy seeing him standing next to other players like dang hes a little dude.
F U Jerry for letting Zeke go. He should have retired a Cowboy. 😢
LVE turns his neck like my 41 year old does now. Lol
I knew Vaughn was short but this video really shows it
Yeah that made me feel some type of way seeing Zeke you know he would rather be be with us
Micah does play on the sideline. Lowkey need the defense like that all the time
Man I love 55 he's going to be great in the future
Leupke TD made my day on top of an already great game.  Gotta give it to McKeon for that hustle to recover the ball and make that happen.  Great run by Turpin, just gotta protect that ball. Hope Parsons is all good with his knee/ankle.
Zeke’s face at the end “I’ll send the jersey to you” !!! You can tell Bill told him non of that shit.. ESPECIALLY IN A loss…. Especially in his worst loss ever… 😂😂😂😂
As a cowboys fan I will forever rock with zeke
Man Zeke. You’re missed.
Always love "sounds of the sideline" moments. 😊
Maaaan. Tears rolling for the love between Zeke and the his Boyz!
Man you could feel the whole game shift after Tolbert made that special teams play!!! Special Teams makes a huge difference, Turpin scares me though ugh! Jus bein real
All respect for Zeke. Thank you #21
I'm not crying.
Whats crazy it seems almost everybody wanted Zeke gone, now people saying they had tears for him stop the cap, the zeke hate reached a high last year wasnt nobody crying but talking s***
I want Zeke in a uniform again. Idc anymore. Straight love that guy...
You know this team is all in when the offense and defense is cheering and celebrating for each other.
MISS THAT DUDE ALL LOVE ZEKE CBN
That O line is gonna be the X factor against the 49ers ... If they dont win the battle in trenches, then their done ... simple as that
I got chills at the end 😮‍💨
5:02 jumpscare 😂😂😂😂😭😭
Bro, the last part of the vid… deep breath!!!
S.cks to see Zeke in that philty pats jersey. Best to Zeke, and phyuck the pats
Got me crying over here again seeing Zeke hugging everybody! #DC4L #21
We need Zeke pass blocking
All love for Zeke!
Zeke should have thought about his selfish behavior back in the day when he held out for his money, he got paid and in turn played like shit, and got cut he could have been a hall famer but will now be an after thought
What an era with zeke. I wish nothing but the best! Will always be a Cowboy
I enjoyed this more than I figured.
Micah looked off on sideline. He is doing to much though. Less is more would benefit him greatly.
Jt couldn’t even do the crawl Goodwin kept pushing him💀
That ending man 😢
so much pregame hype - so few offensive points ...
The end Got me Seeing Zeke But let's go take care of the 49ers. Let's finally do it. We got this.
We need to sign zeke on a cheap contract at the end of his career so he can retire a cowboy
Zeke will be back soon.🙏🏽
I almost cried 6:37 😢
Dang micah looks upset 💔
Give Hunter the DAMN BALL!!! I pray Dallas stomps the hell outta the niners
Seeing Zeke still get that Dallas Cowboys love at the end 💯 I'm not crying 😢, my eyes itch dammit 😂
Man I want him back on the team...
Man, I got emotional seeing Zeke at the end. So many good memories. He'll always be a Cowboy and I'm sure that when the time comes, he'll retire a Cowboy.
They do love Zeek.  That was nice to see.
Thank you, Zeke, for everything!!
They can try to bring him back. It doesn’t feel right nor looks right.
Damn we did zeke dirty
Seeing zeke with the old squad really brought a tear to my eye
😢 ZEK BUT STILL AWESOME GAME
Wish zeke was here this year for this Super Bowl we bout to get 😢
damn man… see Zeke made emotional. love that guy. wish him well
Damn bro really got some tears in my eyes, Cowboys Nation Always Got Your Back Zeke✊🏼✊🏼#21
DARON BLAND IS HIM i expect him to get 6-8 ints this year and be a superstar x factor next year on madden
Zack Martin and DLaw are the real OGs of this team them 2 the only ones from the romo era who really still there
Got to admit.. I teared up at the end.. zeke is definitely loved
Man zeke needs to come back to Dallas he might not be the best on the field but u can tell he meant a lot to the team in the locker room zeke come back
Wtf my eyes got watery 😂
Your heart ain't working if you didn't tear up with Zack loving on Zeke. Brotherhood.
Zeke should took paycut and staid with a Superbowl team
Ohh hell yea🇧🇸🇧🇸🇧🇸
Superbowl bound how about them Cowboys
We need these win or lose.
Damn skippy "He's a Cowboy!" 💖 Also, so much love for Zeke! Felt those hugs.
I see u post this when we win but wt about when we loose I want to see how these guys deal with adversity
Two Words. Daron. Spicy. 🌶️
Y’all need to post when we take Ls too
Micah seems pissed this week, I guess because of the injury, but I hope he brings the fire this week for the niners
Watch this video again and keep an eye on Micah Parsons on the sideline.  He is so focused right now it was no laughing or none of that he ready for this week.
Zeke need to stop playin and come on home.
Do more of this for the Dallas Cowboys.
Bruh we keep putting up almost 40 a game without RedZone TDS just imagine when we get it together..omg!!
Zeke needed to go but it was a sad seeing him in another uniform.
3:53 they both rolled and got up the exact same way
Bland was no joke, stay healthy & keep it up. Loved seeing Zeke at the end miss him much❤❤❤
Mannn... it was tough watching Zeke at the end.😢
daks my qb
Everyone has a reaction but Parsons. While everyone else is celebrating and having a good time, Micah is just staring straight-faced. What goes on in the mind of warriors
BRING ZEKE BACK!
We miss you Zeke 🤟🏼💯💥
Zeke 😢😢😢😢😢
Whoever made this a series needs a pay raise and a statue in their honor
Micah seemed pretty quiet on the sideline
I look forward to these every week but i got emotional on this one! Zeke Zeke Zeke
It’s safe to say our CB2 spot is in good hands with Bland once Gilmore decides to hang it up💯
why was micah so quiet tho??????
Commmmeeeee homeeeeee zeke!
"There's only one more, There's only one more out there" AL Harris  What does that mean ? It's all a script and they no how many interceptions or takeaways????? Or one more for a hat trick?
Hunter LUPEKE will end our redzone problems. Why Mike didn’t see that before baffles me omfg MIKE let him eat already. I’d say it to his face bruh 😂
You’re a good player Zeke
Damn I miss my boy zeke . Sad we going on this crazy run without him prime zeke & TP our team would literally be unfair at that point
Awww D-Law telling the Wolf hunter welcome back and Zeke❤
Im neither fannof these 2 teams but going back to see the old team, the respect they have for zeke, like brothers
Ezekiel wi retire a Cowboy....
Dem Boyz got a lot of love for Zeke! Kinda choked me up. Bland played outta his mind! Dak made good decisions with the rock! Solid win! DC4L! Go Cowboys!
We love you Zeke!
Their language shows what kind of people the Cowboys are, unclean, sordid, untrustworthy.
Brings tears to my eyes to see Zeke not part of the Cowboys 😔
Why did parsons seem so down ?
zeke at the end man🥲🥲🥲
One game at a time.
Is it me or did Micah seem off? He looked kinda upset, hope the team’s chemistry is ok.
We miss zeke, Cowboy would get him back if they could, but business is business. Zeke suffering injuries is hard to keep him fresh for years the way he ran the ball. Through this zeke and the cowboys have act like professionals respect from both sides. Hope Zeke comes back still a great weapon for offense.
did yall here DLaw say "Need ya" to Zeke?  He aint lying either. not just for short yardage but blitz pick up. no one like Zeke in that department.
man zeke needs to be back
Zeeeeeke!!! 😭😭
Another wholesome moment from Dak making sure Hunter got his first TD ball
5:03 jumpscare
Sad to see Zeke in another uniform..Great win Boyz
Hope we can get another video next week 🤞🏼
I understand that it’s a business but Zeke definitely brought that running game back since Emmitt Smith! I love it❤❤❤  I hope that he stays healthy!!!
Let's hold McCafferey and the Niners to 60 yards.
Cowboys d is the best offense in the league
Great videos appreciate them. Man Zeke class act.who knows maybe we get him back for playoffs
Man I miss zeke. Wish he could be apart of this ride. But is it just me or did Micah look down ? Like he didn’t have the energy he usually has ?
Second best part of a W is you know we get sounds from the sidlines
Love Zeke always will once a cowboy always a cowboy how bout them cowboys let’s have another sounds from the sidelines vs 49ers
Miss you zeke 😢
Like how they showed they fellow Cowboy some love thats what its about
That boy Elliot will always be a cowboy
The cowboys still have mad respect for that boy elliott
This offense needs to use Hunter more,.especially in the Redzone.
LVE SCORING A TD WAS AWESOME. WOLF HUNTER BABY
Zelle forever a cowboy 😢
Micah looked pissed 😂
Man, I love Zeke and miss seeing the star on him 🙃
Zeke leaving didn’t hit me that hard until I watched this.
LOVE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It was time to move on from zeke but he earned every dime we gave him!! Always a cowboy that's forsure
Bland almost had 3 of them thangs
Anger wit the DOT to Ghoulston for 2 had to be fulfilling af lmao
Zeke will always be a Cowboy. He’s always welcome back in literally any capacity.
Hope they play like this but better red zone this week
I miss Zeke with us  😢
Bland has really stepped up after losing Diggs. Just goes to show our depth on defense. Also what an amazing effort by McKeon after the Turpin fumble. That is championship effort right there.
I've been waiting on this episode since 4pm last Sunday
Why didn’t we make one of these when we played against the cardinals? lol
The love for Zeke at the end is👌🏼
I sure like how they respect Zeke.
5:02 😭😭😭
Who’s chopping onions 🧅 😢
Man I teared up there with Zeke saying hello and goodbye to his brothers. Still miss him and his positive and enthusiastic personality .
Hope we get another video after next week🙏🏾🙏🏾
We miss you zeke keep ballin stay healthy 🤙🏽
Good to see the love the team still has for zeke
I love these     but I want to how things look when they are losing also
I miss Zeke
That shit hurts my soul. Zeke my boy man
Zeke's production may have decreased but he's an all-around back! We could have still used him to do so many other things.
anyone else shed a tear at the end??? #ZEEEEEEEEEEEKE
Am I the only one who thinks cowboys should move on from LVE? He plays so soft. He doesn’t fill gaps, cnt fight through a block and gets run over every play.
Micah didn’t say one word during this lol
Another great sounds from the Sideline!!! Thanks for making the videos a little longer...
5:03 What's the story with Mountain West Guy??
We watched Zeke grow up. I wish him nothing but the best and I'm happy he's still on a payroll.
I'm not crying, YOU"RE crying
Bring zeke back that was sad
Once a cowboy always a cowboy 💯
Osa waving goodbye as Turpin zooms by LOL!
Yeah wasn't prepared for the end😢 lol
LVE seems like one of those dudes that's just happy to be here.
I didn't hear Parsons say anything lol
anyone else notice ceedee seems to be down lately?
Good stuff man! Feastin
Bring zeke back as a rb assistant
The ending part had me tears with all the love of the ex-teammate Elliot.
So cool Zekes salutes we’re included here as well
Dam zeke… 😢
Welp see y’all in 2 weeks
Ok lets bring Zeke back
WHOS CUTTING ONIONS HERE!?
Turpin running around screaming like a happy kid after the pick 6 has me cracking up 😂😂😂😂😂
Is it just me or does Cee D not looking too happy? I wish Dak would target him like a #1 more. Lamb is hard to stop any where on the field 1 on 1.
Zeke should of took a big pay cut and been our fullback.. oh well YEEEHA!!
I hate business side of football but it is what it is. Much love Zeke
I knew Daron bland was going to be special from the 5 ints he had his rookie season. He’s playing on the outside now since diggs is out so he’ll have to adjust to the routes in this position change but he looks good right now. As long as he stays healthy he’s going to be okay.
My thing is why CNT we get these wen they lose I wanna see they energy and if they know what happened n they emotions after a lose not just a win n ima cowboys fan
How 'bout them Cowboys? 🤠
Zach Martin's mindset is motivation! "Another opportunity to whip someone's a$$!" You're blessed to be able to go out there and try to dominate another human being. Savor the moment.
Love zeke on the thumbnail. Great job!
Damn Micah don’t talk?
Zeke and Zach Martin! Running back and Lineman love is like no other on the team.
Why does this make me want to get zeke back on the team?
Zeke will forever be a great cowboy!  love that dude!
BRING ZEKE BACK IF PATS RELEASE HIM
Let’s go! Sounds from the sideline on my birthday? Thanks for the gift Cowboys!
Seeing Zeke healthy made me happy. They not using him correctly 🤦🏾‍♂️. He still could of been effective here tbh.
Love Ferg. We got ourselves a DAWG
I actually liked LVE’s dance moves
ngl it hurts like hell to see Zeke in anything other than Dallas colors.
6:35 whos cutting onions here?!?
I'm crying for Zeke. Bring Zeke back Jerry you need to listen to the fans!! 😢😢
Ya'll gonna make me cry with that ending lol
Sucks seeing Zeke on the other side.... reallyyyy suxxx !! Was my favorite cowboy 🤠 and now I need a new jersey 😂
We all know about the love between Zeke and Dak, but Zeke hugging Zack Martin is where it's at. Bond between the O-Line and RB is tremendous.
Wish nothing but the best for Zeke! Maybe when his playing days are over he can come back and coach the next generation of RB's 🤘
Nah I wasn’t ready for that jump scare at 5:00 💀
These subtitles got me 😄
I can tell the team miss & love Zek the end of this video showed no 🧢
How about Bland. 👏
They need to imply Luepke a lot more in the offense he's tough fast & can catch it's so much McCarthy can do with that guy...
That Chauncey Golston 2 point play was wild lol
True test coming this Sunday DC4L
Love our Dallas Cowboy family.
I don't ask for much but a sounds from the sidelines next Wednesday would make my month! Please win 🙏
Watching zeke at the end with his old boys gave me chills damn time flies !!
We miss you Zeke ✊🏽 #cowboy4life
❤❤❤Zeke 4L
Zeke🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
It sucks seeing Zeke over there
5:03 is the scariest thing Ive ever seen. that guys eyes are completely white.
I've Been a Cowboy fan for 36 years I don't even watch other teams play because I don't want to give them the ratings but I'll say this let's see if you still have the same attitude when it comes to a bigger stronger and More Physical. Team in San Francisco yes you guys are faster but will you be smarter even though I know it's all the sit-up anyways you guys will probably win Sunday night just to lose in the playoffs against them again
Man I miss Zeke 😢
Just take a look at all the friends, teammates, coaches,,,C,'MON MAN!!!!   He's a Cowboy for life 💥 He bleeds silver and blue,,,,, that's it #zekecomehome
i love this team so much but you can see Micah not happy about the team not being able to capitalize in the redzone multiple times they showed him he looked pissed
We need a brad sham commentary option , I am tired of cowboys games to being ruined by the likes of chris collinsworth and joe buck
When the Boys win this week the Sounds from the sideline are going to be really lit. Let's go, give the Niners all they can handle.
28-17 49ers beat the boys
Note to Vander Esch:  You never look stupid scoring a TD.  Let's Goooooo
Love it! Fitting in the Zeke love in the end is greatness!
ZEKE need to come play fullback
So proud of our team❤️🖤 #DallasCowboys!
Finally ❤
Why could you literally feel the Zeke love through the screen?
They need zeke on the goal line
Where ganna need some more of that from hunter especially with the 9ers
Really do miss Zeke. Such a great guy!
Zack is really like a big brother to all of them especially when he hugged Zeke.
Damn that last part 😢
We are eating today
Zeke better retire a cowboy once he’s done with 🏈
I’m just focus on San Fran with I will be at that game. This week hits different for me.😡
Te extrañamos Zeke 😢
Love you zeke 😭🥰
ZEKE WILL ALWAYS BE A COWBOY. PLEASE BRING HIM BACK BEFORE THE END
I don't care where he goes or what uniform he wears, Zeke is DC4L.
Man I hope we can bring Zeke back like week 13 then make a deep playoff run with him on the team. But this is also a business.
Daron Bland balled bro, best thing I could think of I can’t wait till he becomes what he should and we got our whole D back next year.💪🏽💙⭐️💙
When Zack hugged Zeke, mannnn it almost made me tear up
BLAND IS HIM
Im not use to seeing Micah look like that. He didnt seem like himself😢...I know he was hurt but he seemed very different.
Ceedee is pissed about something. His demeanor is different
I MISS ZEKE 😢
Heckofa dub😊 Man, what LOVE Zeke's manifested here I hate how we wasted his and Dak's rookie contracts 😮
Need sounds from the dugout for the Rangers!
Wish they make these videos longer
Feels So Weird Seeing Zeke In a Patriots Jersey Miss Him man😭🙁😢
I need more of these videos! I ❤ sounds from the sidelines! That Zeke love at the end was heartwarming ❤
The upside on Bland vs Diggs is that he doesn't jump the gun guessing the route. He stays close and makes plays...
COWBOYS..COWBOYS...COWBOYS..COWBOYS.. YEEE... LETS GOOOO BOYZZZ
Micah hurt
Dak Every Game  YEAHHHH HERE WE GO
Hugging Zeke just doesn't feel right they miss him like I miss him on at least pass block and goalline
Seeing Zeke at the end brings a tear to my Eye😢
Love SFTS...I actually shed tears at the end lol Zeke 4eva a Cowboy!
526 views already??? Just went up 8mins ago
The end of this video has a similar feel to the Jason Garrett one when he came back as the Giants offensive coordinator. That one was an emotional reunion too.
We miss you Zeke!
Coach harris nice The love they showed to zeke especially zack was cool
HERE WE GOOO
I love it especially at the end when Zeke got to connect with his guys again. Now let’s go bust the Niners Ass!!
Yessir
5:03 scary
We got sooo many DOGS
#26 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Micah looked mad
I look forward to these every Wednesday.  Thank you keep them coming🎉🎉🎉
I wonder do the D-line take these linebackers seriously😅
😂😂
I need more physicality from these backers
And eat we did
Addicted to sounds of the game 🤤💪🔥🔥
Goooood morning!!
