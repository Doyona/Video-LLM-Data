So after properly digesting cold feet safe to say rimzee definitely hardest in the uk at the moment knowones matching flow or concept or visually someone tell me different and dnt come with Stormzy he’s gone pop lately 🙈
This song gave me flashbacks off prison when he said  wretch32 dont go I was in HMP Elmley lol 36mths was the best time of my life I had no worries I was more scared geting out then going in HMP is only hard if you get a IPP then its hard

Rimzee hit me up, this property shit I’ve got it on lock, small building company, I’ve got developments and commercial conversions on the go. I’ve got an online auction house and estate agency business along side an off market business. I’ve got you if you need some mad info. The reason why, because I come from a council estate and I used to bang upper Clapton dream, when I was still on madness, that shit got me through them 5am drives. Bless up.
Run this up 🆙
Still on repeat

⚠️ATTENTION CALLING ALL DIRECTIONERS⚠️  As you all know, the 11 year anniversary is coming up on the 23rd of next July. But we have some projects we must complete before then. Those targets are as follows;  1) Even though songs like More than this, best song ever, etc, have hundreds of millions of views,  it's still not what they deserve.  We have decided to stream the song on July 22nd, the day before the 11 year anniversary to get the song to charts. Maybe we have to start streaming a little bit before hand, but still. We need to stream the song on every possible platform; YouTube, Spotify, iTunes, Amazon music etc. If this is the same group if people who sold FNB stadium within a miniute, then why couldn't we be able to do this?  2)  This was planned a year ago, but this time we could easily do this. The second project is to stream drag me down, which as we can see is so close to 1 billion views, but story of my life isn't, so we will stream story of my life on July 18th (The last Sunday before the anniversary) and make the masterpiece number 1 on that day. I think non of the above are difficult tasks, but that's only if we spread the words. So kindly spread the words.  Copy and paste this, guys, believe me we can do it! I know we kinda planned it last time and fell short, but we can do it if we try harder   Guys July is approaching fast, we need to start invading all videos on the internet. Copy this on to your clipboard, and paste it onto all trending videos. Guys, seriously now, we have GOT to do this.  Btw I realise this is kinda unrelated, but idc this has to happen ❤♥️💛💙🖤❤💚🧡💜♥️💙💚🧡🖤❤💙
Rimzee on top!
Real one, inspiring

Rimzee is the realest💯
This brother is too sick!!! Keep up The hard work!! InshaAllah everything works out for you. Keep motivated. 💯
insha'Allah big
Real rap 🥶🥶🥶
Rimzee is the UK Nipsey. Appreciate him now. Not as progressive in business maybe as Nipsey, but he’s been away for a few years. Give him a minute to catch up and get used to how much things have changed in the world the last few years. But he is Nipsey. He speaks about the struggle, but also about sense, about business, about the streets, and about progress. He doesn’t resort to gimmicks. Independent grind. Underrated with the lyrics. Hes 10 times better at rapping than he used to be. This shit makes me wanna grind. This is motivation music. This is music for hustlers.
U know the songs a banger when he says something about panoramic roofs
Real rap , real life not like half these bums stunting for the gram   Hardest out there bro 💯
I do rate it work flow good 😌 lyrics real and truth b told preach to the choir he knows wassup

IF YOU CARE FOR YOUR SOUL Please stop by and reflect on your life before is forever too late asking yourself these questions YOU HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE TO MAKE IT Does God exist? What will happen when you die? What if hell really exist? Where will you spend your eternity? There is only one way to be saved and that is through Jesus Read the bible which is His word Jesus promised the eternal life in heaven to those who repent and believe in Him You must be born again (filled with His Holy Spirit) which is a supernatural work of God that happens only when you truly repent  and then God can transform your heart and you can experience real God and hear His voice However as it is written in Genesis 6:3  "My Spirit shall not strive and remain with man forever" You can't choose to be saved whenever you want and so you can miss God's last call to be saved which might be this very message There is God's deadline and if you cross it you will be forever lost, while still alive on this earth God is not mocked DO YOU REALLY WANT TO SQUANDER YOUR CHANCE FOREVER? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment,  so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him. Hebrews 9:27-28 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- How shall we escape if we ignore so great a salvation? Hebrews 2:3 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,  but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. Hebrews 10:26-27 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, as the Holy Spirit says: Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion, Hebrews 3:7-8 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- To the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with me on my throne, just as I was victorious and sat down with my Father on his throne. Revelation 3:21 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Philippians 4:7 NIV --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What no eye has seen,what no ear has heard,and what no human mind has conceived the things God has prepared for those who love him 1 Corinthians 2:9 NIV
