Hey do you have the link / style code number for the Zara dressing gown coat pleaseeeee I can't find it online xxx
I like makeup declutterring videos even though I don’t have enough makeup in my collection to even do that but I was trying to find ones that were not boring and your video is the only one I could get through lol
Hello! For the lounge wear, what size bottoms do you order? I’m usually a small but in Victoria’s Secret I’m a medium because their underwear run small. Just for reference please. I have a huge shopping cart but I don’t want to have to return 😅
Everything looks so organized!!! Love youu so much!!! Your teeth look incredible too by the way!❤😊
Your videos are like therapy for me
Are you wearing fake tan? And if so which one?? Xx
Also did you spray your face with self tanner cause that’s genius
Get a short flower vase for some shorter flowers and it would look so cute! Also I feel like the back of it should be against the wall??
where are the black jeans from at 24:40
I’m not in the Christmas spirit but my wardrobes full of autumn clothes n boots 😕 maybe we really are adults
Does it ever snow in London? Love from Russia❤
Where is the white fluffy skirt from 😍😍😍
When you say youre a certain Astrological sign/ Virgo, you are giving permission to demons to take over your body
Could you show us how you shoot your insta pictures on your own? Obsessed with them 🥰
from "I'm not gonna overwhelm myself" to "suddenly feeling overwhelmed" can relate 😅
Anyone know where the white fluffy vest is from
Sorry the first earrings you wear, where are they from?😍
Can't wait to see the x Mas tree. Those ornaments are gorgeous
My comfort person🥹🩷 i love your videos 💓
Could you show us how you do your sleek back pony, I love 😍
The glass boot would look nice with some lights Init ❤
That dresser that you are trying to figure out how to decorate, I think the books look great! Maybe a nice addition would be a plant that drapes downward 😊
"Im not gonna overwhelm myself" - "I suddenly feel overwhelmed" 😂😂 Love you!!
Can you do an apartment tour when it’s all decorated for Christmas? 🎅🏽❤
You are soooo gorgeous. Do you wear hair extensions? X
i'm super inspired to sort my undies drawer out and have a spend now! 😍♥️
I like the books and jellycat on the drawers!! Or you could try perfumes? You can get the little stair looking acrylic stands so your perfumes are stacked aesthetically ✨

The alarm gives me so much anxiety 😟
Hi sunshine, my Sister is a Virgo and when the organizing mood hits her she'll be organizing the whole house at 2a.m, it's wild😂. You did an awesome job with organizing your makeup drawers👍🏾. Way to go Mads, staying in the ice bath for a minute. Definitely mind over matter baby👏🏾👏🏾. Cute vlog Mads, thank you as always for and I hope decorating your Christmas tree helped eased your anxiousness. Take care and have a blessed week🙏🏾🧡.
❤❤❤❤
What are your gym trainers?? xx
Girl what tan are you using please? ❤❤❤ STUNNING!!!!! 😍
I like the drawers there but I think the pull out bit on the drawers needs to come out towards the wardrobe. So the back bit is flat against the wall if that makes sense. You absolutely smashed that ice bath. It raises your dopamine levels and keeps them high for hours after. x
Where are your grills from? xx
