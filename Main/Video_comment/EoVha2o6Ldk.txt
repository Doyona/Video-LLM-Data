WHO JERKIN THEY MEAT⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
Still waiting for cartman's assburgers
1:50 Remember, there is not an upper limit on spice for a recipe for Hermes. He has had spice too hot for the Robot Devil.
Awesome 🤩
4:17 I just imagine Alvin literally drop-kicking you down the stairs  🤣
"Jerking our meat" Bruh
hey remember when you made pasta at 4 in the morning you know, before the custom-made clothes, and the thousands of dollars in hardware
Me trying not to laugh
My mind emedietly went... "Dont laugh at the food name, dont laugh at the food name, dont laugh at the food name..."
THAT’S WHAT HE SAID🗣️🗣️🗣️
“You did WHAT to this meat?!”
Who up jerking their meat?
love it!
12 scotch bonnets is too much man
This Episode of "This Episode is Brought to You By" is Brought to you by Miralax.
Classic babish is back, nature is healing
I stopped watching when the channel became too mixed up and confusing  I subbed because of his merger skills making classic movie food then came games new people and too much behind the camera stuff I gave one look at the thumbnail and clicked play hoping i could see something classic again that made me sub
WAIT, THE THUMBNAIL SAYS WHAT
I love things that age poorly
Wash your  MEAT!!!!
Short, sweet and fun. Great episode
Konuşma şeklin, ritmin, tempon, ses tonun ve nefessizce konuşman baş ağritiyor.
5:20 now i know how a mexican feels when they see a taco bell
apply sensual innuendos here lol
Those innuendos were too smooth.
I read the title too fast
i’m so happy classic that videos are coming back😭😭🙏🙏
🤤
“Hold your breath, the air is gonna get spicy” haha😂
(Immature giggling)
Commenting for algorithm
“You did WHAT to this meat?!”
All my love to Alvin but nothing beats the dulcet tones of Andrew’s voice. Pure Babish. Love it.
Lav it maman
Love double entendre.
1:52 As far as runing for dairy products, just remember, Andrew is a white yankee. Do with that information what you will.
Sterno niçoise next
Who else mis read the title as something else. 💀
toast your spices everybody
You WHAT THE MEAT?
I will not be watching this video, but i would like to say: WHAAAAT?
He did what to the meat
This man jerks.
Or, save time and dish washing, rinse mouth with bbq lighter fluid, lick a match. Holy cow this recipe is spicy! 😳
👍
I'm no food expert... but those look like baby back ribs???
can you do the rib platter from norbit
“Now it’s time to start jerking our meat!” …………… but that wasn’t in the Video 💀💀💀💀💀
I Love Binging With Babish Videos 💙
You forgot to eat the rice!
YOUR DOING WHAT TO THE MEAT!!?!?
1:08  1:54 sauce  4:46  6:04 chicken
Nice food!
I love Alvin and always have, but sometimes just chilling with Babish is amazing.
What meat?
2:40 when he said he sauteed the peppers and not to do that, all I could think was my mom cooking chile in the morning and the whole house coughing and dying
Same
So…it’s got nothing to do with jerky-style food?
Who up Jerking their meat right now 🍖🍖🍖🍖🍖🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️
This is my 2nd viewing & you giving up cause it was just tedious was the realest ish I've heard you say 😂 My prior tree sess could have im0act but either way 😂😂😂😂😂
Ever wonder how they had beef in futurama when cows are extinct?
Me on friday night
I never can get past it.... saucepnnn 😂  At least he doesn't use 'ayeggs' 😂
Wow man this is a great video! I hope the lemon pepper jerky win the 1v1!!!
1
0:41 to skip the sponsor bs
As a Jamaican watching you put that many scotch bonnets was scary 🤣🤣🤣
this episode's music gave me a dragons dogma kind of feeling
He did what to the chicken?
You did what to your meat?
“Now it’s time to start jerking our meat.”  I’m gonna bet you knew what you were talking about.
Get the seeds out of the peppers!!!!
I love Futanari!
Look, it’s Auntie Esther!
In the kitchen, straight "jerking" it, and my it I mean, haha, well, let's justr say, my meats.
You did WHAT to these dishes?
In my kitchen, straight up jerkin it. And by it, haha, well let's justr say it's my meat
who up jerking they meat platter
😢 All of this should be done outside
😂😂😂😂
I'm seeing a distinct lack of master baiting jokes... how disciplined is this fanbase?!
Mmmm…. Fire…  AHHH!!!! IT BURNS!!!
"its time to start jerking our meat", way ahead of you boss. 🤣
Eating this while watching Jack Reacher & Jack Ryan...😏😎
Enough jerks for this video.
That’s wayyyy to many scotchies
BABISH JERKS HIS MEAT IN THIS VIDEO
It's hard being a vegetarian Babish fan sometimes.
4:56 “go ahead and give up after 3, because it’s tedious and you don’t wanna do it” 👌🏽😂
speaking of jerking meat... helloooooooooo internet
Classic style lets gooo
Jerkville hot chicken and bbq ribs sound amazing
I bet this would work really well with Fry's lower horn. It's used to it.
Which  peas did you use for the rice and peas?
BAM!
2:00 He definitely knew what he was saying there 😭😭
Young Kimberly Thompson Ronald Smith Jennifer
“And now it’s time to start jerking our meat” ….Sure
Thompson Linda Smith Brenda Rodriguez Jose
I was subscribed to Factor for a while and I was surprised by how many of their offerings were actually edible. Couldn't justify the cost after my promotional rate wore off though.
Those are baby back ribs…
I miss these sorts of episodes.
I genuinly hold a severe disdain for fine dining, food looks tasty though.
Smith Susan Gonzalez Amy Hernandez Jose
soy sauce instead of browning sauce is going to make you permanently banned from the caribbean
Follow me😊
Heh
The brown sugar wasn't enough? You needed to add MORE sugar?
Perez Brenda Jones Scott Harris Kevin
I love ot when Babish jerks his meat.
Freak ahh plate 👀
PLEASE make Sweet Tooth's white tiger steak from Twisted Metal!!
2:00 yahhhhhhhhh buddy
What about Lela's flower "salad"? 😂
What about the RICE!?!?!?!?!
2:00 Wow the one thing he says without making it sound naughty
The chilli in that bowl is something no white guy can handle.
Looks very gentrified......
Can you put actually babish in the titles so i can click the videos with you narrating
When I saw a video about meat jerking this isn't quite what I had in mind...
dont let a jamacian see this video ahahahhaah 😂😂😂😂 you didnt do one right right
Soy sauce and a pellet smoker. 😂
He should make Meemaw’s brisket from Young Sheldon
I appreciate you not only is culinary skill, but also his dedication to keep the joke going😂😂😂
jorkin da meets
oh my meats BEEN jerking babish
How about Hermes skin that melts down a robot
in the kitchen. straight up "jorking it". and by "it", haha, well. let's justr say. My meats
Deserve none!
2:01
Those ribs look phenomenal
Make anything off of the Gobbersmooches menu of Arlen, Texas.
those are baby back ribs. st Luis are much flatter
Speaking of, onlyfans when?
I miss Babish. Alvin should have hos own channel. I wouldn't mind if Babish made a video every two months at least it would just be him.
4
Alvin’s cool but we really only want babish
I need Binging with Babish and Basics with Babish back. 😭
This isn't the video I thought it was, still interesting though.
one thing i added was lime and orange juice, and toasted the spices as well.
music is a little too loud
i feel like every Jamaican is dying right now seeing you rub off the marinade "sO tHe SpIcE dOeSn'T oVeR pOwEr ThE bBq"
Futurama's jokes keep getting funnier the more I hear them.
missed opportunity for "knock it up and notch, BAM!" and spice weasel
I was today years old when i realized that scene was a double entendre
Giggity.
That is not rice and peas
Has he tackled any of the foods from Fallout yet ?
I equate dollars to food
U SHOULD HAVE DIPPED THE CHICKEN WINGS INTO THE MIXTURE INSTEAD OF BRUSH
Two words ha ha
Please..Moon Cakes from the Watchmen mini-series
I love the way he jerks all that meat ❤
I can’t believe that I’ve been watching your channel since 2017, and it took 7 years for this to come out!
Suggestion:  Zog's gout meal from Disenchantment (part 2 episode seven)
Do Hermes’ manwich
Even the meat jerks.
yes
This was a great episode of Babish jerkin’ it!👍🏻
I am an expert in the subject
2:02 jerking our what ? 🤨
Drinking heavy whipping cream straight up is psychotic
who up jerkin they meat
I could almost hear the "Hey Baby I hear the Blues a-callin'" intro with this one
what can the scotch bonnets be substituted with that is less spicey?
Freaky Babish
My favorite was Zoidberg's platter with the edible crown. "What's it made of?" "Wood!"
Ayooooo this sounds delicious but pause 😂
2:00 Pause... PAUSE...
So, when is the Babish CookUnity meal coming out?
I remember seeing this episode as a kid and to this day this looks like the sickest food of Futurama
Next episode needs to contain plenty of Bender's special ingredient "confidence"
Saute the peppers?!? If you don't have great ventilation then congrats you just maced yourself
Nice video, but you didn't even give it one blast with your spice weasel.
As I suspected, it's the music.
Pause
bro is using pellets
*Redacted*
I actually don't mind the Babish Tries stuff, because we can't all make food like this so it's nice to see if any of the easy fixes come close. But I do prefer to see Babish on here, not his mates. I'd be fine with fewer videos so long as they're all Babish, but I also know the algorithm demands a new video posted as often as possible, and it's just not viable for a single person. It's a shame.
What have you been doing all day? Babish: Jerking the meat
Do you pour ingredients at a speed proportionate to how fast their name is to say?
i thought the "futurama" was futanari at a quick glance
HE DID WHAT TO THE MEAT
I need to stop watching these rn because I'm broke and have been starving for a week now. I got like.. Bread from church and hot sauce. And cream of celery which I didn't even know existed
...i'm sorry...what kindof pepper? That's not a real thing.
Dooble entendre
I’m sorry… WHAT meat???!
Dry your jerky in the smoker!
0:41
Pause
Your website used to have actual recipes. Now it just send me back to YouTube. I hate it.
Love Alvin tackling stuff, but I missed these, man. More pls
2:00 PAUSE⁉️
Hey Babish, think you could make Heinz Doofenshmirtz' Cheese Wheel from Phineas and Ferb?
I’d love to see Babish make a deep fried mars bar
This video marks the third time I got a babish ad with a babish video
A return to form
2:00 do what to my meat!?
I would love to see any of the chocolates from wonka recreated
Maybe next time he'll add LSD to be more show accurate
can prepare everything but time, well outcome is perfect
I gotta stop watching videos like these whenever I'm hungry
I can’t wait for the inevitable fallout episode
I hate eating spicy foods, they hurt too much. I'd still add this to my own Clean Plate Club, even if it kills me.
Still waiting for Babish to make the Deacon Sandwich from King of Queens
Hi Babish, I’m going to need a refined recipe on the Jello Cake from Fallout if I want any chance of making it another year.
:)
MAKE BURPLE NURPLES
2:00
Would love to see a dish from the fallout show
Try making something from Fallout, since everyone is going crazy over it, and the games lately.
Make any dishes from Dragon Quest
you are the reason i went to culinary school thank you
me watching this episode at 10, having no reaction to the clip: ah, nice dish of meat me watching this episode at 30: teehee
.
0:41 for the start of the video.
Scotch bonnet. The greatest of all peppers.
Once again asking for an OFMD episode with guest Samba Schutte
Awesome. I wanted to try this
Get back to doing this!
Looks great, but I reckon it could do with a bit more hot sauce
Hey guys! Calculo- i mean babish is back!
I MISS VIDEOS LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
we NEED big smoke’s order from GTA idea by ​​⁠​​⁠gojisar7505

As a Jamaican, there is A WHOLE LOT missing from that marinade but I applaud your passion and would definitely still demolish that platter
Make big smokes order from gta San Andreas
My goat
Ur the man banish for your culinary and cinematic expertise
I hope for a Dungeon Meshi video and BCU its the only channel who can do it
Please dont Bam my date
Make Bender's dish after his training. Try to be accurate with the ingredients 😜
Love the old school video!  I got worried about the channel when i saw the "Babish tries" videos.  This is what we love you for Andrew!
I like the new content but i miss babish himself like i like alvin but babish is the reason i subbed i wish we got to see him as the main focus again
now wait until babish makes chili dogs from sonic
I dont need a recipe for this😂
Please do Big Smoke's order
Finally!! ❤
Big smokes order
I miss this
Why do I automatically click off any videos Alvin makes?
Can you make your version of the Spam Lamb from MASH?
As a Jamaican I approve the marinade 🇯🇲🙌🏽  Edit: we need to talk bout that rice and peas though 😅
Why on earth would you use tomato paste, brown sugar, and honey in a barbecue sauce recipe then add ketchup?
I want to see Labarbara's goat curry one day, the one that burned through several floors and burned the Robodevil
Best video in a long time ! No messing around, no offence to Alvin   But this is why I subbed
trash...smoke the jerky next time
People! That's not how you make Jamaican rice and peas, what he made was an abomination. 😂😂
Hey baby I hear the blues are calling, tossed salad and scrambled eggs.
Not liking this trend of subscription meal services sending TV dinners to your door
Why did I think it was going to be from the "man horn" episode 😂
After having added brown sugar, honey and ketchup: "know what this needs? some sugar!"
I hope you consider doing a BWB on the lotus flowers from Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief
Pause.
could you make the king crab next?
I make one of these every night if you know what i'm sayin.
I make that exact sauce. I thought it was something i made up. Never knew it was an actual thing. 🤔
That rice a peas tho I've never seen it made that way
this one so far from what it should be
Yes please. Would love to see more of these old style videos!
Missed opportunity. Should've had a double entendre counter in the corner.
"Now it's time to start jerking our meat". OK, is my mind completeley corrupted or did you say that on purpose for the double entendre?
Hehe boi
Please make the everything candy from Jimmy Neutron
For the next episode, can you do the various Wonka Bars that were introduced in the two adaptations of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory? If not that, then can you do steamed hams?
Day one of posting this until Babish makes the Revival Baguette.
As a Jamaican, I appreciate your attempts 😭
Do Goldplated Wings
Babs I need purpleberries from Futurama man I need it bad
Futurama baby and is there any meat he can’t what?🤔
Sympathies for Babish's toilet.
Can you please do Popkelp or the Kelp Shake from spongebob
View count is climbing higher than a green snake up a sugar cane
I used to work with a gal who owns a company that imports pimento wood from Jamaica. They bring in one whole tree a year, and the wood chips are to die for when smoking. 10/10, highly recommend.
😏
This old classic style of Babish video is much preferred than some of the more modern ones
PSYCHO chef JERKS HIS MEAT for THOUSANDS TO SEE
Tiktok girl rice and peas
mi bomboclaat
I am surprised Youtube didn't have an issue with the tittle of the video.
*sees the title*  *deep breath*  Who... up at night-
Clicked just to see if Babish has a spice weasel
Your mom made me one of these last night
u did what to the meat?????
Are we not doing "Phrasing"? 😂
But… where’s your spice weasel!!
How about the rice? U didn't taste the rice
Babish, this is the type of video that brought most of us to your channel. Please do more. It’s one of the few joys I have. Cheers
This video could have easily passed as an April Fool's episode, seeing as i checked if it was posted on April first when i opened the video
I will never be mature enough for the real world
Futurama is a classic slow. Only makes sense that Babish goes back to the OG format...and yes, as others have said, it is nostalgic and hopefully we see more of these kinds of videos in the future
Who are you kidding Andrew? You are a celebrity chef in your own right.
GYAAAAAT
for the chicken lollipops, if you have a spare cigar cutter around, you can just use that to cut around the bottoms.
You forgot the spice weasel.
So the million dollar question is where did you get the scotch bonette from ?
2:00 5:04
Day 342 of asking for big smokes order.
Make GIR's Chocolate Bubblegum Slurpee from Invader Zim!
Make Amity's Fairy Pie from The Owl House!
expected a tissue paper sponsor after that ending
Can you do Brain Butterfield's Christmas Pizza?
I was REALLY expecting a few puffs from your spice weasel smh
Leaving a comment because the more engagement this episode gets, the more likely we get more videos like it.
Can you do the 99 cheese pizza from TMNT?
I wonder if the Rastas will like this
Me: *watches part way through the video then has to pause* Me: *comes back a few days later* Me: Oh yeah! I forgot to finish this! Wonder where it left off? Babish: 2:00 And now its time to start jerking our meat. Me: Thats enough internet for today
Can you look at making brown stew chicken and Oxtail, Jamaican style, of course!
Would you consider doing another Skyrim recipe?
A dozen scotch bonnets is insane 😵‍💫😵‍💫
You need to do “Caribbean Draino” next
I need to see him  Make honey soy chicken
Great to see a Binging with Babish video and not more clickbait tier lists for once.
Beat up our meat
I decided that it wasn't worth watching Babish at all, because he let a Chinese guy in.
@babish this question is unrelated to this video, but since you hate the taste of cilantro (it's generic no judgement) do you have a similar reaction to coriander? I ask because they come from the same plant. Just a curious person who likes cilantro.
Great episode, reminds me of the ones that got me hooked on the channels years ago
i swear the closer you are to the equator the spicier the food gets.  cause spicy food makes you sweat and you will cool off in the tropics... you become the air conditioner😂.
Babish make Tamil Kothu Roti/Parotta
Im walking on sunshine
PLEASE MORE OF THESE TYPE OF VIDEOS!!!
Please Make The Calzones From We Bare Bears.
Finally and episode based on pop culture! I was missing those!
You gotta make just buns from Louie
Perfect candy from Jimmy Neutron or Bill Dautrieves family BBQ secret recipe from KOTH
Whew, all that fluffing and jerking really whet my appetite, I must say!
Thank Christ we got a real Babish where he isn’t ranking stuff. Those videos are terrible
I miss Being with Babish. Any plans to relaunch that series?
A cooking show advertising a preassigned meal planner. It feels contradictory about the soul of cooking and creating food!
Awesome! Love Futurama references. Would love to see someday Sluzzlewurst from The Amazing World of Gumball episode "The Lie"
I haven't watched this channel in two years, and i suddenly remember why i watched every video during lunch at school
Now do Sterno Nicoise.
That rice aint it :/
"Wow there are a lot of new comments on this 3 year old episode." And then I checked. This came out just the other day!
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
jerkmate platter
Idk how else to ask for these but what about Gambits Beignets from X-Men '97?
Liquid sugar for that added buff
Heart skipped a beat at 5minutes in, when you almost put your hand in the marinade 😂
Which episode do you roast a clove of garlic for a snack for yourself ? Thank you
More of this content Babby!
😏
It feels nice to see Binging back in the lineup. I’m not sure if you take suggestions, but I’d be interested in you (or Alvin) doing the Academy Special from Pokémon Scarlet/Violet’s Indigo Disk dlc. It’s a big platter with 4 different dishes, and it’d be interesting to see you make your own gummy worms.
I know I'm going to sound like an idiot, but why do you need a spice grinder?  Wouldn't the spice get properly grounded in the food processor anyways?
As a Nigerian who grew up in Toronto and always eats Jamaican food, I can say this looked absolutely delicious. My only issue was the wetness of the rice. If you want to know what rice and peas is really supposed to taste like, make sure the rice is completely dry, and make sure you wash the starch from the rice before serving, otherwise you'll end up looking like Peter Griffin by the time you reach your 40s
Okay, but if you wanted to make a less spicey version could you replace the scotch bonnets with the same volume of bell peppers+ scotch bonnets or jalapeños?
Hmmm........ how about Muriel's Happy Plums from Courage The Cowardly Dog?
Do the white chicks dinner where he is like I want a steak smothered in onions with extra garlic
Hey, just wanted to join others in mentioning it was really nice to have a more classic style episode again, was nice. Also, wanted to offer some of the food offerings from Unicorn Overlord as possible future ideas. Tons of options and Vanillaware is always lavish in their depiction of food.
yall think babish is a big pickaxe dude?
Since the Fallout series came out, maybe the foods from Fallout next? Probably not, like, ghoul jerky, but something lol  Edit: Thank you! Lol
I really don't like the "Missing Chefs" portraits on the CookUnity packaging.
Thats not rice and peas 😂
I would love to see you do the fancy dinner from Mr. Peabody and Sherman
I was awaiting the "BAM" for the entire video 😂
I'd like to see you attempt to make the fish that Vi eats in Arcane ep 5.
No blast from a spice weasel?
You're getting closer and closer to doing another American Dad. I can sense the will in you.
Babish jerks meat well
Please stay with this editing style and music. It made me actually stay the entire time
For fun and see what you can do, you should make the sandwich max makes in wizards of waverly place that he calls “to the max” (sandwich)
2:01
Baby back ribs ?
I once sauteed a habanero pepper. Never again.
Futurama!!!!
You're telling me a teriyaki grilled those shrimp?
Elzar had been seduced by the dark side of cooking. Cilantro, mango salsa, raspberry vinaigrette!
Please make Memaw’s Brisket from Young Sheldon!
The classic music... takes me back to the first kitchen.   Just watched the Mythical Kitchen interview and I just want to say, thank you for being you. You're an incredibly kind and honest human, and offer me a lot of comfort through my stressful days in grad school. Keep on cookin'.
Those ribs look more like baby backs, a St. Louis cut is taken from spares
Blueberry muffins with an equal amount of blueberries in each muffin from Casino.
The thumbnail is wild
You did WHAT to the Meat!?
I have a request! Fries quatro queso dos fritos from Psych. Been rewatching the series since an awesome video essay came out a bit ago... S03E14
Bam!
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
2:00 😢
Oh. Excellent
Can you make the glop from fanboy and chum chum?????
PLEASE MAKE THE GLOP FROM FANBOY AND CHUM CHUM
Came here for jerking of the meat stayed for the food
What do you do with old fryer oil?
While this might be way too spicy for my tastes, it's great to see a real binging episode. Cheers!
I need this
No Spice Weasel? 👎
2:22 Babish jerkin' his hog
Auntie Esther?
Eat Drink Man Woman please!
Cool classic episode! Though very weird that cinnamon doesn't show up anywhere in here.
This definitely felt like a classic episode to me. I've been here since you had under 100k subs, and this has the spirit of those early videos.
Great video.
come on son
RICE and PEAS!
Go ahead and give up after three, because it’s tedious and you don’t want to do it
Heheheh
0:52  MY MEAT
Always happy to see another Binging or Basics episode... and nothing else
WHERES THE GINGER?????
please do limestone pie and hot melted silver from Return to Oz!!
Binging with Babish! Classic style, no nonsense just like the og videos. I barely watch now that it is mainly Alvin.
Yes, More Futurama stuff please.
I'm getting heartburn just watching you make these!
We back baby!
Nice return to form
Now we need Elzar's week old bread.
With X-Men 97 killing it, you should make Forge's Bison Chili
he forgot to kick it up a notch with his spice weasel
Glad to see Babish still cooks! 3+ weeks way too long to wait with just Alvin (whom I also love) & "babish tries" (which i skip) as filler
I think I’m possibly the only person who remembers (and watched) the show You’re the Worst, but there was breakfast tater tot or breakfast nachos that I’d love to see
in the stripped club. straight up "jorking it". and by "it", haha, well. let's just say.    My meet
Rat Burger, Demolition Man
You fr with the thumbnail title? 😒
BRO!!! BEEN ASKING FOR THE CAPTAIN CRUNCH CASSEROLE FOR YEARS NOW!!!
Make sure @Babish sees this! Just to let you know brother I checked out CookUnity and they immediately undercut your coupon with 60% off and 20% off future weeks. Really lame and I hope this doesn’t hurt whatever deal/affiliate thing you have going on
Feels like it’s been forever since I’ve seen a Binging with Babish video ❤
HEY, its me after I use the restroom
⏸️
Next episode has to be something from the Fallout show
I miss these types of videos. I love Alvin and all, but we have been getting a lot of him
ridiculous large harmburguer and berry jumbo from frieren pls
Pretty sure those are back ribs. Just sayin.
A DOZEN???
Can you PLEAAAASE do Modern Family's "Carnitas Diablos" from the episode "Starry Night"?
Love ya Babish, but those rice and peas might be deserving of a botched with babish redo
I'm the 351st person to watch this video!
I LOVE that you went back to this format and background music - I'm so emotional!!
There’s no meat he can’t beat!
why is the rice and peas made with actual peas😭
1:58 "And now it's time to start jerking our meat". That sounded wrong.
I HAVEN'T EVEN WATCHED IT YET BUT WE BETTER GET FALLOUT RECIPIES!!!!
Reuben Sandwich from Quiz Show!
DO THE SESAME CAKE FROM CONGO! STOP EATING MY SESAME CAKE!
WHAT meat??🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Patiently waiting for Babish to make, taste and improve Chum from the Chum Bucket
petitioning babish to go back in time and make tossed salad with scrambled eggs for his old themesong because he never did it even when he did a whole episode for that show
Title got me to click.   Not what I was hoping, but this is fine too
I'll be coming right for them
Very nice
The take on hot chicken is beautiful. I think the flavour profile is incomplete without ginger and allspice but I’ll correct that at home Lol
I wonder if TV shows just have food now so that Andrew can recreate them.
looks like the same cartoonist that do Futurama are the ones that so the Simpson's cartoon as well....
If you keep doing Futurama recipes eventually you're gonna have to add some "essence of flavor"
Ein Kommentar
*clicks on video* YOU DID WHAT  TO THE MEAT?!?!?!!?!
Those rice and peas are not jamaican rice and peas
You had every opportunity to kick things up a notch with your Spice Weasel yet didn't.
Y’all know what you did with that thumbnail 😭
Let the off-color jokes begin . . .
There's too many jokes in here about ones meat and jerking it.
The hot dog soup from that 70s show!!
Suggestion: Froggy Apple Crumple Thumpkin from Chowder
Someone: I'm going to a party on friday night Me: 2:00
GLORIOUS!! 🥺👏🏽👏🏽 My mouths' watering just looking at it with all the Spice 🤤🤯💯
I would like to see you make Reese’s Pieces (or at least an easy to make at home version) as famously featured in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial
The stewed sea prunes from Avatar
Jamaican here: Came here to complain about the chicken but… it’s looks delicious. My rage is converted to hunger.
White pigeon peas and rice is a no,no
Does this recipe still work if the meat is from a female?
Please make rig juice from regular show
The Salty’s menu items from Smiling Friends would be awesome!
(:
Futurama is the best show ever.
Yay! Classic style Babish!  Also, can you make the Bagna Cauda from Babylon 5 please?
This is OG format of babish
Somebody needs to introduce Alvin to delicious and dungeon
Never heard of pimento wood.  I learned something today, and it was not only interesting but useful information.
I still wanna see babish make the vegetarian luncheon from the deadly spawn, obscure and cheesy horror movie but I’m curious of how the grandmother’s meal would be recreated.
Keep the Futurama train rolling by making LaBarbara's recklessly seasoned Curried Goat, with all the face-melting (and robot-melting) goodness you can imagine.
why is this not served anywhere. I need it.
Glad to see you doing a cooking video again. Those "I tasted every version of this" episodes are so boring
so we not gonna talk about the name!?
Random thought for Anime with Alvin The "Makima Meals" from the Chainsaw Man Manga. (If you know you know)
Gourmet Sriracha Shrimp from Filthy Frank The Sandvich from Team Fortress 2
“The jerky was a little too thin, so it dried out too much.”  But don’t you know? Jamaican food is SUPPOSED to be dry. Someone told Gordon Ramsey himself.
Those ribs looked 🔥
HOLY HECK I have been asking for Futurama foods for YEARS now! I hope this isn't the last one!
Classic Babish is best Babish. I still enjoy the newer stuff but I really miss having more of these older style vids.
Who up Jerkin they Meat rn
Didn't even taste the rice😢
Pause.
That motion with the spice grinder and the hand below the counter- you sly dog, I see what you're doing.
Why are all of the recipes on the new website behind a paywall? You've never asked for a subscription just to get a written recipe
Anyone else wish he would make a separate account for just binging with babbish?
Please do a Raisin Loaf episode, from James Gunn's Tromeo and Juliet. Raisin Loaf. Please. Please do a Raisin Loaf episode. Thank you.
*sees title *hammers that click ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Edit: 5:04 babby you’re a man after my own heart lol
Who's this bald guy? Where's alvin?
Fallout foods, please!
Can you make Randy's food network dirty call chicken from South Park?
How about the lentil soup from Lisa the Vegetarian, Season 7, episode 5? It is in the ending credits if I remember correctly if you listen to the song backwards...
I`m kinda sad there was no "BAM"
Great cooking video
Finally, a regular episode.
That rice and peas had no colour 😭
Now you should do Bender's Sterno Nicoise from the same scene
What in the bumbaclot
Does anyone know what trager he has?
babish jerking all these meats!🍖🥓
Have you seen Chef?
hey babisch can you please do the pasta mama from star trek strang new world.
This era the joke wouldve probably involved gooning somehow 💀
A recipe for cactus juice from Avatar the last Airbender would be nice since it'll be getting hot in a couple of months.
bab straight up jerkin it this episode
Love the classic babish
He did WHAT with his meat?!?
Always nice to see Babish handle food of the  Jamaican variety.
2:00 Babish needs to take a food safe course or something. Rub that bacteria all over your shirt and arm. 🤢
Now we just need LaBarbara's Curried Goat, Sugar Frosted Sugar-Blasted Purpleberry Puffs (with Loquat flavored orange berries) and Slurm
0/10 didn't use spice weasel. C'MON BABISH!
focus puller took the day off for this episode
I'm a little surprised Hermes eats meat considering that he has professed Rastafarianism multiple times...
The Coconut Curry Tamapande and toast points from the A-Team
Really like these classic Babish style episodes
Matt Groening and JG Quintel really gave this show a whole season's worth of content
We jerkin meat?!
Yooo peas and rice.
My manwhich!
5:06 uhh, "Beat up the meat"
Runza
i really need a plate of Pajeon ;-;
Thank you Mr babish
Finally
Oh that’s so yummy
Make Khlav Kalash from The Simpsons
4 years ago you favorited a comment asking you to make the monkfish turkey from malcolm in the middle. i consider this to be a tacit agreement on your part and will feel very betrayed if it is not fulfilled.  pls
Rated M for mature
that moment at 5:00 when common sense beats muscle memory
PAUSE
Jerky turkey is a must at xmas in our house🇯🇲.   Then my bro got a smoker......  GAME OVER😂😂😂
I do believe he loves saying 'jerking our meat', great video. Futurama is one my favorite shows I love to watch.
The chef in the opening clip sounds just like Wakka from FFX! 🤔
He did WHAT to his meat??
Just saw the title and immediately came to say "CRANK IT HOSS".
Finally a classic babish video!
Ayoo?
Ah yes, the rude and unreasonable chicken
finally not alvin
Did he just call those babybacks St Louis style?
The chicken. 🍗😍🤤👍
Love it 🇯🇲
Could swear that was a baby back rib......
I have been watching Futurama since it started. I have watched the original season through at least a dozen times. This is the first time I got Hermes's joke about jerking meat... Also, will we see the pony Bender prepared for Amy Wong?
I make this nearly 3 times every day
I'm expecting Sterno Niçoise next
Alvin has higher authority than Babish?
5:04 I was expecting that sentence to miss the word "up"
I only recently got into the British show Taskmaster and have wondered what it would be like to set Rea the same cooking tasks as those contestants, like a meal using every letter of the alphabet or a dish styled after a national flag. Though not sure if you could do it with as much surprise as on the show!
That's enough scotch bonnet to keep a normal man crying for his mother for a year straight.
"liquid smoke" is one of the most 'Murican things I have ever heard
Not even a single hit from the spice weasel? Smh
You can do Turducken from (11x6) Or you could do Curry Goat from Season 9/7A
The ribs look great…BUT THOSE ARE BABY BACK RIBS, NOT SPARERIBS.  A small difference, but still a difference
basics with babish
BAM!
🇯🇲Jamaican approved ✅️
How was this not your April fools submission???
Watch him do a manwich episode
Babish jerkin his meat. “Like”
You should try the Crust Bucket and Crab-N-Go dishes from the Splatoon series.
I unironically listen to this song on a regular basis. Top quality driving/focusing music. Love the classic babish style
0/10 no Spice Weasel
This video contained less meat jerking than the title implies
I have been waiting years for this video 🎉
So nice to have an actual Andrew episode after so long
Jerking every meat sounds like a wonderful exercise indeed.
The eggcellent challenge is iconic, but this is another thumbnail for the ages. Mouth watering. Clean plate club. 💯
No blast from your spice weasel tho?
I'm pretty sure burning capsaicin is a CS Gas weapon
Jamaican food tutorial 3:20 "Smoke for anywhere from 3 to 6 hours"  Okaay?
Jerking meat usually means something else!
That thumbnail though 😅
Please make the baked bags from My Little Pony
Hey I know you guys take the sponsors as they come, but like.. maybe start using some sponsors that your fans can actually afford, not just ones that give you the most money?
I wanna see him make the Sterno Nicoise next.
YOU FORGOT to ADD GINGER TO THE MARINADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2:43 "Don't do that - your eyes and nose will never be the same"  *immediately places on my list of things to try*
lol pause
You should do Bender's personalized meals next and make Amy's pony
"That's what she said!"        - Bender B. Rodriguez
title is wild
This video is NOT in my sub feed. Had to go out and find it myself. Thanks YouTube!
Babish I love you but where is Dungeon Meshi dude
Sad there was no cameo of the Spice Weasel. Looks really tasty though!
Great job 👏 now I want some food like this 😂love that Futurama episode too
You should make the Pie-Flavored Pie from asdfmovie. Solely because of the logistics involved in baking a pie inside of another pie.
I miss these old-school videos. More please!
love the classic babish
You did what to your meat..?
YEAH BABY WE JERKING MEAT
Classic. Babish. ❤️
Reminds me what I need to do tonight 🍆🥴
Some Jamaican out there is shaking his head mon
dude. you ruined it
But what about Labarbara's (sp) curried goat that's so spicy that no one dares peal and eat your skin?
I know artists developed and change all the time but this episode helped so nostalgic. It gave me the same feeling of peace your old episodes did 💚
This is not the kind of meat jerking that I was expecting.
Since you have done jerky. I would love to see an episode where you compare American Jerky and South African Biltong
Backyard Soup from Elinor Wonders Why!
Its nice to see these old style babish videos every now and then!  For your next one do you mind if I suggest Yeto's Soup from twilight princess?
Okay this looks absolutely delicious, but I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods. My nose feels like it's burning from watching this.
Make the skip's scramble from arrested development s2e11
Krabby patty with jellyfish jelly? You can use it as an opportunity to make berry preserves
I realize how midwestern I am everytime I hear you say "Sauce pan"    to me  its a Sauce "Paaaan"
Please redo the naco from Kim possible pleaseeeeee
Pause 😂
Didn't even realize this was a new episode lol, thought this was old because of the music
Now you KNOW that title card was  gonna raise some eyebrows 😅
YAYYYYY FUTURAMA
You forgot to give it a blast from your spice weasel, a staple in all of Elzar’s recipes
For Alvin: Any food from Don't Starve
My favorite line from Futurama 😂
How about Congressman Furlong's Bay Scallop Gateau from Veep, or the Paella from his dinner party?
Those are baby back ribs
Yes, I need a Traeger just like that. It's the Cadillac of pellet smokers!
It's much easier when you have four arms for jerking in fairness
mabsturpation joke  ha ha ha :DDDDDD
So we're doing Binging on Thursdays now?
Now you have to make a Manwich
THIS WOULD BE A BETTER MEAL IF YOU TURNED IT INTO A SAUSAGE
:))
Petition to get the Nuggets from Smiling Friends
you should attempt to make Sausage Quilts from Parks and Recreation
Make it South-Park-style with a generous helping of crème fraîche.
As long as you're reminiscing about food from shows Phil Lamarr was in, you could recreate the Meat Beaters skit from MadTV.  I don't know *how*, but it'd be entertaining!
Alvin had a day off?
Clicked on the video. Alvin's ad for butter played and confused me, thinking I was already in the video. Thanks youtube
you forgot there was also rice
Sweet lion of Zion! This looks tasty!
Next to make Lababara's spicy dinner that burns thru the table.
Traditionally this dish is made with Spice Weasel spice
I will continue to politely request foods from the Homestar Runner universe. I think we deserve to watch Andrew make and consume as many gourmet Bronco Trolleys as he can in 30 seconds.  And also foods from A Nero Wolfe Mystery.
I completely missed that double entendre until just now.
the classic background music returning made me tear up ngl just need the OG intro sequence again!
You should make the turducken from the Futurama rebute
Big up from a yaad man
Love this video. Futurama is one of my favorites 😊
The amount of punts Archer could simply not resist is insane
You should add Elzar’s quote at the end, “I knocked it up a notch. Bam!”
Day 190 of petitioning Babish to make the Triple Fried Egg Sandwich with Chilli Sauce and Chutney from Red Dwarf. Also love a Futurama episode.
My Manwhich!!!
04:03 everything reminds me of her
I have been on the internet way too long.
AHHHH Hey Babish, awesome to see you!!!!!!! <3
For every like this comment gets I'll do one pushup...
I feel like 1:50 is why you don’t just eat it straight up.
Gotta love that classic Babish background music
You should do Beef Stroganoff from Symphogear.
Please do a video on sloppy steaks from I Think You Should Leave
It's used to it. Woooooo.
Lobster from Scooby-Doo and the Gourmet Ghost movie
Moon Cakes from Over the Moon movie
Sweet 😆 I just made that 😂 Edit: nvm, I certainly didn't make that
PAUUUSEEEEEE
Cake-flavored Pizza and Pizza-flavored Cake from Gravity Falls
"Now We Cooking" ~Probably Babish
Ok I NEED you to make the Darvog from the Looney Tunes show
you did what to the meat ?
I just got the joke in the introductory Futurama clip, that double entendre was great. XD
Fried Orb from The Owl House
MEAT MORNINGS
Krabby Pate from SpongeBob episode, "Krusty Katering"
we have been Blessed by Babish
Is it me or did this channel fell off?
jorkin my peanits
Ayooooo No Diddy
😋
2:15 *Ainsley Harriott has entered the chat*
This video felt like a classic Babish episode—love seeing new videos that remind me why I subbed all those years ago
First
It's too early in the day to be jerking the meat - wait until midday, at least
DA LIMBO MAN
Among us
Time for some delicious lower horn

Been a year or so since ive watched this channel
Suggestion: Adam's ribs from Hazbin Hotel
Thanks For this ❤❤❤❤
