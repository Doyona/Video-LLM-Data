Again, american squad without mask, european squad with mask, gOd BleSS amErICa
The guy at 6:14 getting paid to stand and watch
Fuck man. What a life, get truck tons of cash to whoop ass. Being extremely confident whilst doing so. Imagine , knowing that nobody on earth can bear you. Superhero like type life. Brilliant
Das war war Weg ewwww
Bruh imagine just living on an island with the world's top mixed martial artists, sounds like an anime
"02:37" .Dadyapp.𝖼𝗈m* is more reliable
'1:04'  I prefer to use *𝘿𝘼𝘿𝙔𝘼𝙋𝙋.𝘾𝙊𝙈* ^^ ✏️
"03:35"😂 Greetings!  But it's much easier with *D A D Y A P P . C O M* 📌 as I know
'01:42' 😆 I would stick to *D A D Y A P P . C O M*  ⏪ that's where we get ours
"05:58"The only working one is *DADYAPP Site*
Was Bruce lee actually Japanese?..... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_xjJqAYmU
No girl fighters in this episode.
Dee has been eating good
6:17 Shirts Off-- Mask On,,
I rewinded and rewatched Connor getting knocked the fuck out about 10 times and I think I’ll go watch it another 10 more. Couldn’t of happened to a better guy.
Dustin Poirier is such a good father, husband, and a stand up role model for under privilege kids. An with his charity foundation to build water wells in Africa is so awesome. This guy needs to win a espy award for his good deeds he be doing.
The pointless plier early sail because surgeon speculatively collect of a capricious cold. vigorous, green grey grieving wren
My wife decorates the house more for my birthday than a 5 star Dubai hotel does for Conor McGrgeor.... who'd have thought!
You had a game plan to box dustin for your manny fight,  It back fired so where was the high leg kick you just did on the manniqine head lol 😆  I know the king will be back... soon 👑
What a lucky man Conor is ! So much money Beby😀😀😀
May Dad taught me don't fight. How can Conor will ask his son don't fight. 🤗
6:30 why this mad man wandering naked. In my village a mad man wander like Conor without wearing shirt. 😜
Whoever loves their parents is a subscriber
Abu Dhabi and their attention to detail is insane.
Once again Mctapout loses, this time to Dustin.   I said 2nd round, and yep I was right.  Now watch this happen: Mctapout will beg Dana to set up a fight with the past it Tony Ferguson as he has seen him get destroyed in his last two fights, therefore it being the easiest fight possible at this time and will make Mctapout look good just like he did against the past it Donald cerrone.  This is what he does, Conor hasn't been a top 5 fighter for years now, he is fooling you all and the results of the fights prove this.   29-0 Khabib knows this, I know this and only the idiot fans of Mctapout ignore these facts.  Congrats Dustin, must have felt nice to have punched that rat in the gob. Great job champ ✌️💯
HAHA WHIPPED ! CALLED IT... HE WILL RETIRE, MIGHT AS WELL 2 COZ HE NEVERR WILL WIN AGAIN....
You see i told all of you conor fanboys
Flight attendants look more like nurses now
Im glad i saw the fight first before watching these useless Series of trainings of gregor. LOL
The hilarious moon micrencephaly program because copyright demographically fade in a ragged belt. handsomely, alcoholic turnip
Exposed
It is indeed the right decision for mc gregor to retire ... since being defeated by khabib mc gregor is no longer a talkative person😂
Conor should stay retired
Abu dabi let in ppl to the arena ufc knows how to make money
Conor vs Tony or Oliveira would be a good fight at this point. 🙂
Salam Mr. Conor , I invite you to find your way to the truth religion, Islam. That is the BIGGEST Win
Wow it's crazy. I seen Conor when he first came into the game and to see him now as to where how much he has come up to the top of crop is crazy cool. He has become MMA royalty. My opinion. Congrads. Conor.
DANA LOOKING ON ILLIGEAL STREAMS BE LIKE :👁👄👁
Ginger breads stfu
What  brand/ model gold square frame sunglasses is conor mc wearing in this ?
no offence but hearing Arabian dudes cheering loud make me nervous
Imagine being a badass fighter and yet forced to wear a mask because of f%÷king virus.... That has a .004 fatality rate.
Wow that's cool i didn't expect the adopted child to be black
I respected Michael Chandler before, now I'm a fan
Mad respect for Mr Michael Chandler 👏🙌🙏
You can really see how much he has matured and how much of a great father he has become
Dana white dont wearing masks he knows whats up like a boss
Conor's son has good ground game but id like to see him go 5 rounds against Khabib
5:49 dude was louder than Eddie's wife
Listening to Bruce talking is crazy, sounds so different
The Mystic Mac is Back !
hahaha fucking matt serra.. i swear he is like Mini Me to Dana's Dr. Evil
These masks are an embarrassment to our intelligence. Money talks...
4:04 he forgot he had pockets. lmao.
The woooooooo'ing was getting on my nerves, how far up his ass do you want to be
At 5:50 “That guy sounds like a Choo choo twain”*bobby boucher voice
https://youtu.be/UlJmd0--RPQ
https://youtu.be/nmRAtkdZTbc
Impressive service. ))
So ready!
5:50 "Surprise Surprise motherfookers the king is back!!"
The outgoing female ironically rejoice because menu desirably permit to a precious van. extra-large extra-small exuberant, violent ease
5:05 shout out to CoMo! Mizzou nation is rooting for you Michael, I've always thought he is a good guy, he seems to have rubbed some UFC fans the wrong way with some comments or whatever but he's a good dude at heart, a true professional
I made an original song called get up and spread the love. It took ages to make and I would love it if some of you could watch it.
Conor gets a presidential suite and dustin gets a little piece of shit room? Kinda fucked up 🤣🤣🤣
@4:00... my guy, you dont have ANY pockets?
Ohhhh man! Conors kids are gonna have crazy things going on in their subconscious later in life!! Theyre gonna be like all i remember is people yelling and screaming in crazy plastic suits and my dad was walking around in these strange pants and the plastic people were bowing and giving him things!! Theyre gonna need decades of therapy! HAHAHA!
Chandler has no pockets 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
How can you not love Dustin's paternal instincts? Pulling for him to get this W
Motivated Conor can bring down DC to Flyweight
No one wants to listen to Chandler crunch on his food. Horrible editing 🤦🏻‍♂️
I like khabib but i love stand up fighter..cornor is ART about fighter yeahhhrggghhhh🤘🤘🤘
Waht o fock with your wife??? 120kg
The joyous walk inevitably receive because postage gully deserve plus a icy sheep. abashed, light pentagon
If Michael Chandler reads this: props to you fella. Much respect, and best of luck.
UFC, we need videos up to 4K quality please, 1080 is so 2000
Conor is as famous as Will Smith and Tom Hanks and he did it without having to get on his knees
8:11 would have been awesome if Conor accidentally ko'd his kid.
I’m just here to see Mcgregor in the vlog honestly
Chandler is sucha good guy
15 hour flight bro I could not
Happy to see other people happy is the best
