Who will take over????
Gerrard was asked to stop 10 in a row and establish us in europe  he delivered both, he should have won more unfortunately he didn't but he done what was asked of him, it was shit the way he left but the epl is some pull if we played in the epl guarantee he wouldn't have walked
As a Rangers fan yes he won the league but leaving for a bigger club Aston Villa are yous pullin ma plonker …..
Love that first lads opinion. Very grounded.
Callum Davidson, are you mad lol, thank god we didn't go down that road.
Just like when Rodgers left that lot to join Leicester mid season, he did exactly the same to us, personally i now hope he does horribly at Villa and doesn't get his get dream job with your club lol.
Rangers legend
Celtic or rangers
I think Stevie was persuaded by John Terry to jump ship to Aston Villa
Steven Gerrard Thanks For 55
Liverpool fan???  Nice scouse accent ya plastic
Saint Johnstone of want to cups in the past thing you ranges of 11
That Rangers fan saying Callum Davidson has only won 2 cups!! 😂😂😂 2 more than slippy then 😂😂
Can’t understand your scouse accent.
But Villa are a bigger club than rangers 🤔
Rangers are bigger than Villa.   That said it's the Premier League. It's all about growing his managerial career to one day get to Liverpool. He's probably about 10 years from that
worlds most successful team without winning the top trophy anyone in Europe can win....ha ha ha ha ha ha...
We got a upgrade in GVB Stevie done us proud any Rangers fan should wish him all the best 🇬🇧
well if you got offered a job from waiter to manager, bet u will take manager.
Doing the opposite, winning with no windows, waste of video
Liverpools bigger than rangers football club... Fact...
That quickly, 3.5 years, u really think he was going to stay in Scotland, small s, for ever 😂😂, grow up ffs, have padro casholoxaa wot ever bk, left gers in a good state, Rodgers 😂😂....
It’s the food chain.  Just as Rangers have taken managers from smaller clubs, so too will they lose them to bigger clubs.  Gerard is ambitious.  He wants to manage in the premiership and the Scottish league is very uncompetitive.
he left for a bigger club. deal with it
To everyone he’s saying he’s not a club legend you’re getting relegated soon now that he’s gone so unlucky 😂
Neil Lennon won more and got the sack Slippy G slipped out the door 🤣🤣🤣🍀🇮🇪🍀
What a snake ???? You ungrateful bunch ...put respect on his name . He led you the title . .  Are you out of your minds.fu
I mean, this had already happened at Celtic with Rodgers, surely they knew he was unlikely to stick around if a Premier League offer came knocking.
How long did the fans think he was going to stick around for?
Just hope Steven disnae Cherry pick our squad !! And we sell them on the cheap a will have lost all faith in our  clubs ability to continue the way we have been doing if cherry picking players  players up hear say 10 million Max or lower . Down there selling  same players 4 times that ..  20 to 30 million mark with same type  good playing form   in the session   makes me 🤢
1 🏆.  Is that proven yourself?
the cream buns are very silent tonight # hail hail
Not surprised he has come south, he’s possibly , like the rest of us fed up with all this independence crap. FIND A SCOTSMAN (if you can)
Wow.... Thanks, from: In Indonesia 🇮🇩
Who are Rangers? You must mean Sevco.
Sad rangers fans ungreatful gang of nob heads he has a family down in England that he moved away from to take the job at rangers he gave u the title and coz he moved bk down to England to be with his family he's this that the other get a grip use might not give a shit about ur family's but he does at least he's back in England weres he's adored
Calum Davidson was more successful than Steven Gerard last season 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the first guy he talks to says there’s no team bigger than Glasgow rangers, well the man he praising seems to think so lol.
That first guy you spoke to the guy with the beard spoke really well. Great example of a quality supporter.
Ayr Utd fan here...what’s the big deal ha
I wish Stevie all the best yeah it's hard to take of course as his profile was such that players who would never come near Glasgow did because of our star manager his aura is outrageous when he talks people listen.Left us in a very healthy position with s squad worth a lot of cash two players fighting for every position in the team.We have nothing to fear from any Scottish team as we've beat them all including the hyped up Celtic team with our third choice keeper in and Gerrard not in the stadium due to covid why should we fear a team thats played bottom team Livingston twice been beaten and got a draw at parkhead lol.
Don't want callum davidson because he's only won 2 cups? The boy took over a team at the bottom of the league that season and won 2 cups that gerrard didn't on a fraction of rangers budget
He needed to finish this season and the next. Show some honour and respect towards Rangers and their fans. Then think about moving on, assuming the success continued. Get Rangers into Euro Champs and perhaps win another trophy would be great for both man and club. But he's taken his chance to manage a struggling club in the EPL, it could be a big mistake and the lost chance to get the great experience of defending a title.
Sevco won 55 titles in 10 years. Wow, now that is an achievement.
Rangers should be grateful he came, saw and conquered but it’s time for gerard to take the next step up
I hope you enjoy some of the gifts hes left you with ie john lundstrum
You dont sound like your from the north west .... Glory Hunter
We’re your wheels still on your car when you got back
Fucking sour much ??
Operating losses of £23.5 Million it ain't looking good which is probably why Gerrard left.
Villa are a bigger club rangers. 100%. Can't understand what people are upset about.
He’ll take over klopp soon need a Scouse manager for the best team in the world ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The man brought us back from the brink love ❤ you stevie g always thank you sir.
Woudnt of been bad, if he didn't say weeks ago " do I look happy don't ask me stupid questions" But GVB is coming and that's an upgrade on gerard so better for rangers. 💙💙
In Glasgow what no man gets is time……..no instant success you are  out on a limb and your erchie bye bye
Good riddance..
UTV!🦁💪
Still a Liverpool legend, done nothing at Rangers never seen the job through, one title thats it in nearly 4 years poor. If he had got 2 titles won some cups along the way well yeh. But in the other hand if he manages that in the English Premier with Villa thats a feat. Back to Gers i would love to see Lampard as manager
Footy Adventures, there was no demotion or relegation, a reformed Rangers had to apply to get into Scottish football  in 2012  & that doesn't happen when demoted or relegated. To be kind & accurate, best you can say is "Rangers became insolvent, reformed & started again in division 3"
jock footys fookin shoiyte anyways...
As a Scouser am gutted for Rangers fans. Think Gerrard should have given them the season. Wish Rangers all the best and happy they got ths 55.
Celtic has done it twice and Wim Yansen stopped their 10 in a row. And brought the best bit of business ever in Scottish football bringing in Henrik Larsson for £650,000. 55 nah mate, it's 1 you have a different trading name so it's a different company as company house will confirm. Unless of course, you can pay off all the money owed at the time of liquidation.
Gerrard took Rangers as far as could go,they have no money for transfer window in January 23 million plus in debt he did the right thing ,,,,, you will have to wait another 10 years for your 56
“Everyone needs to prove themselves before they come to Rangers…” Gerrard came from Liverpool under 18s 😂😂
Like he’s gunna turn down premier league for another season watchin that shite up there 😂💯
Turning your nose up at Calum Davidson when he won more at St Johnstone in one year than Gerrard did in 3 with Rangers hahaha
Stevie g  left rangers for a bigger  team,ps it's a joke so send the wrath0🇬🇧✋
Leaves a hero never a legend thanks for stopping the 10 rangers back room staff and cheers for being the face of rangers stevie
Zombie bassssards 😂😂😂
Fella in the first interview was class. Staunch af💪
This guys talking complete shit. If he was devastated why has he got a stupid smirk on his face and excitement in his voice. Plus if a real liverpool fan we all know SG has always been someone touted as the man to replace klopp when he finally goes but wouldn't happen if didn't have some prem experience under his belt.
gio every day
abdul
Tin pot league....of course he wants to manage in a proper league, Man city away, Liverpool away, or St Mirren or Ross county away....lol....he probably knew the writing is on the wall for Sevco and his next transfer budget is £500 😂
He wanted to prove himself to liverpool like he can Get the job when klopp leaves
I am a Rangers fan,,I have been a fan for over 60 years,,however If the manager decides to move on I believe he has every right to do so,,put the boot on the other foot,,,if the manager was failing the club,, results going down hill the directors could arbitrarily sack him as they have done many-many times before. Good luck Steve at Aston Villa.
He asked How long has he  been at st Johnstone for when he won 2 trophies … it was his first  his first season as manager  lol .. what did stevie win in his first season or second season  .. that’s right nothing lol
Well you lovely Rangers supporters great people but Big Sam is available 👍
He’s waiting for Liverpool job
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂🍺🍺🍺🥃🍾🍾🍻
The biggest difference between the SPL and the EPL is that almost every week in the EPL you are challenged. Look at the title winners for the last thirty years in both leagues and who cam second.
Got put down haha if only
Rangers fans are so deluded that they thought that a person with high (basically legend) status like Gerrard will stay in a shepherd league for longer than 3/4 years.... LOL  He came there to prove himself as manager and to build his manager credibility and experience, not to his dream club.
"nobody is bigger than rangers football club" - lol norwich is bigger
If he any good at villa  when klopp leaves liverpool he probably return to liverpool
Rangers  was alway  a stepping stone for Steven g
Domnic Rabb is free at the moment.
Steve G , more like Ali G. !! Rumour has it that forest Gump is in the running. Seemingly he is not happy about taking over the SECOND biggist club in Scotland
A successful manager leaves and he is a rat. A bad manager good riddance, you can't please everybody. SPL  is a two horse race, Stevie G won the two  horse race. Ye should be thankful.
Wonder how many rangers players he takes to villa
I'm a hearts fan personally id go for Frank lampard his wife is gorgeous 😍 seriously go for lampard
Calum Davidson only 2 cups 2 more than SG tho lol hel never get the rangers job but just a point just 2 cups lol thats a major feat for St Johnstone
What you talking about Sevco have won 1 league title. 55 lmfao Stevie G the miracle man who wins 55 league titles in one season 😂 🤣
Tbh. Its not like its a suprise. You gotta move fast in football when opportunity comes knocking. Just ask Brendan Rodgers after he left celtic and lets be honest he could leave Leicester in a similar situation soon. True the timing is never great. And speaking of time, time will tell, namely in the next 6 months how his mark is left on rangers.
Moved from Sunday league football to the premier league.. cmon grow up, everybody knows rangers was a stop gap
Love when he says no one is bigger than rangers football club some clowns in this video 🤣🤣
He still fell over
All the Shettlestons on here saying "He only won one trophy" The ONE that mattered, Roon ye's
"Put down the divisions "is doing a lot of heavy lifting here . "....  Hahaha  ..Dont let the truth get in the way of the facts fella ffs
Yeah well it drives you bloody nuts players and then managers leaving every 5 minutes just when you think the teams getting somewhere, a saints supporter you end up fighting relegation every other season ridiculous over the last 5 or 6 years Liverpool had at least 6 Southampton players look what they did in the end.
Everyone e has to prove themselves before they come to rangers 🤣🤣🤣🤣 has that boy been on the thunderbird…. Gerrard had no experience to talk of. Youth team at anfield…… Scottish league easiest in the world that’s the only way gerrard could get his paws on a league medal. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hadn't a clue we had a shot a group stage. Celtic to win the title. Ange-Ball to win the UCL
Only 3 rangers fans and one English?
Will Villa's board give him the time to get things right if things aren't going well, Rangers board gave him all the time and help he needed, player's he wanted even if it meant financial problems, allowed change's at the training ground that he wanted, so will be interesting to see if the Villa board do the same.⚽
Nobody is bigger than rangers fc he said 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Gerrard has more fans worldwide 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 next manager is to be the Queen
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Come on the Celts
How's he rat when he won you the league I don't get why people think he's rat
He’s just a climber.
Job done stopped Celtic getting ten in a row and too of the league by four points
It’s another stepping stone for the prime position LFC  He will do well
Why Aston villa  ?
Gerrard to big for rangers
What will the gers do now?
Im a rangers fan and i say good luck to steven gerrard
He eon the the spl and they are still moaning
Derek MacCinnis . for Rangers Manager
Rangers are definitely a bigger club than Villa but Villa currently play in a FAR bigger league. Even the English Championship is bigger than the SPL.
Great content lad👍🏿💯🏆
Lampard for rangers.    Good shout.
I’m a Celtic fan and villa are minnows to Celtic and the rangers.  Stevie g is a fraud Gary mcallister held his hand and pulled all the strings.  That’s why he took Gary away. Pisses me off when someone uses a proper manager mind to piggy tail them self.   Rangers shoulda noticed what everyone else could see.
"demotion" 🤣🤣
YOU’LL  NEVER WALK ALONE LFC WILL ALWAYS BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST AND BEST CLUBS IN THE WORLD OF COURSE YOU WOULD LEAVE AS A STEPPING STONE FOR THE MIGHTY REDS EVENTUALLY !! TO BE BACK WHERE HE BELONGS STEVE GERARD GERARDDD
I wish Stevie G all the best, he done exactly what he was supposed to do ,I for one think he’s done a tremendous job for us and will always be grateful for all his hard work and effort he put in to get us to where we are today  … thanks again Stevie G your an absolute legend       🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🔴⚪️🔵  🇬🇧👏
Can't believe Stevie G would rather play against Man. City, Man. United and Chelsea rather than Ross County, St. Johnstone and Livingston.
Did anyone think he wouldn't go? Top flight England or two team scottish top division Mmm.
Neutral?? 🤣🤣🤣 yeah ok then
Gutted for rangers fans. Everyone won really. Rangers got there pride and club back. Stevie G did a superb job and deserves a chance in a richer league to prove his worth. It's not about who bigger cos this bigger club bs is stupid. I don't mean to be insulting but Scottish football is a budget league in term of money available. To do what rangers and Stevie G did was quite remarkable over 25 wins and only 7 loses in Europa League. Pretty impressive.
Great to see so many drunk Scotsmen providing their expert opinion.
Some fair and reasoned comments there fans understandably hurt but proud because of their huge fan base and set up, they never Celtic just dominate. It all depends where SG sees himself he is ambitious and sees the Villa job as a great opportunity, they are another big club with some fantastic players. Did not see anything wrong with Dean Smith to be honest could he be a consideration or a more local based manager? I will watch this space.
Even if Villa aren't a bigger club than Rangers (they are). The Scottish league is tin fucking pot, and Stevie is never gonna get the challenges and experience he needs to develop in a league where only 2 teams are capable of winning it. And the fact that any of you can slate a guy who is the reason that 2 teams can now win the title is a joke, cause without him, you'd have just as much of a chance of beating Celtic to it as any of those other English league 2 quality clubs
We all move jobs 🔴⚪️🔵
All the best to Stevie G. I believe in the years to come he will be liverpool manager.
First chance,he went,says it all?
I can’t believe it,rangers fan and Liverpool fan myself and orangeman why would stevie do that ☹️☹️☹️
Wasnt demotion or relegation . They where liquidated!
He’ll win a lot less at Villa that’s for sure.
He will be sacked in 18 months . Top half finish is the best u can hope for at villa they go through managers like theres no tomorrow . Alonso will get the liverpool job now . Gerrard will go the way all english managers go and that never gets the big job he was in the big job .
Steve Gerrard Gerrard  He hits the ball 40 yards He's big and he fuckin hard Steve Gerrard Gerrard
6:10 " he's only won 2 cups" aye, so double the amount of Gerrard, with 120 million pound less to spend on wages and players. The propaganda of '55' is as strong as the delusions of the rangers being the same club after literal liquidation.
The guy left us in the lurch couldn't leave quick enough im so disappointed i thought integrity was one of his main atributes    but i was obviously wrong guy is a snake . I knew hed leave but to leave this early in a season where we are chasing champions league .
????? 1 Trophy???????
Sorry to see Slippy G leaving think it's a bad move for Gerrard and Villa he should have stayed and got some decent experience before leaving for a decent job!!!!
6:10 he says Calum Davidson has only won two cups, as opposed to Gerrards one 6:30 he says no to Davidson as the need proven people at rangers.... hang on was this not Gerrards first ever managerial appointment???? Lol
Callum Davidson only win 2 trophys at St. Johnstone SG win one. And people need to prove them self's before coming to rangers.. It was SG first managers job.. What a tool
I think Steven should have stayed at Rangers to carry on the glory he will do know good at the  Villa there is not enough quality at the Villa.
Well said Marcus.
How could any rangers fans give him shit for going to villa when he's just won them the league for the first time in so many years and has them on track to win it again...
That’s rangers fucked 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🇨🇮🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 CELTIC
Callum Davidson has only won 2 cups? That’s more than Stevie G won at ibrox😂
Has the bar dropped THAT low at Rangers that they see 1/9 trophies as a success? I know stopping Celtic’s 10IAR was important, but I think Rangers fans have got tunnel vision because of it.
Glad he’s gone. He stopped us fae getting 10 in a raw hen
More money for him another sourness  van bronckhurst for the job he didn't take the Newcastle job after saying he wasn't interested Kent and Morales
I'm delighted rangers fans aren't happy 🇮🇪
Let’s all laugh at Rangers 😂
"NOTHING IS AS IT SEEMS"? BY PROFESSOR WALTER VEITH AND MARTIN SMITH YOU TUBE POWERFUL POWERFUL WATCH FROM SOUTH AFRICA ENJOY 👍🏽💯😃
WHO INVENTED FOOTBALL 🤔🤔🤔🤐🤐🤐
It's time for Celtic and Rangers to move to the English league. The money  I agree with that one guy I think Lampard would be a good choice
I'm Leicester and I can remember the almost total outrage Celtic fans felt for Brendan Rodgers. Personally I think this just reflects on the perceived standard of the Scottish league rather than the two clubs themselves. Personally,  winning more trophies at Rangers rather achieving at best mid table mediocrity with Villa would be more beneficial to Gerrards long term ambitions. I reckon Duncan Ferguson would be a good fit....
Listen am a Celtic man,Aston Villa are nowhere near as big as Rangers,it's that Anglo bias from people who probably have never stepped in Glasgow,and b4 people say whatever av  been to Villa games b4,and Old firm games (only way I'll go near Ibrox) lived in England went to games  down there,Villa play in a  bigger country/league and get more sponsorship,Brum might be twice  the population but Gers have loads more fans as well,people now equate the money going to premiership clubs to the size of the club,Here's an example,Jason Cundy once said Bournemouth were a bigger club than Celtic; ffs,part of me thinks he was at the wind up,I don't take that guy seriously as a football pundit,he's a blowhard,that comment alone turned me off his show with Andy Goldstein and a listened to it all the time
Steve Bruce. YEEE HAAAA.......
Gattuso is a good shout... He's a goat Takes no pish fae no cxxt
I think Gerrard will win nothing with villa and will be lucky to avoid relegation with a club which is nothing more than an also ran in the EPL.
You could put my mum who knows zero about football in charge of Celtic or Rangers and I guarantee you that she would lead either to the league title by a country mile.
Steve Bruce is available.
Look, maybe  the  timing  didn't  look   right,  but  Stevie   never  let  Rangers  Down,  proper  old  School   Huyton  Lad, what  did  he  give  rangers  3 good  years?  Wish  him  all  the  Best! .....oh  and  the  Title.
Rangers + Celtic are always going to be a stepping stone to young managers..
Did that first guy say "whats Callum Davidson won? 2 cups thats it, how longs he been at St Johnstone".......he literally won twice as many trophies than Gerrard in half the time 🤦🏻🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone who thinks Villa are a bigger club than Rangers is mentally ill. He wants the Liverpool job and anything else is just a stepping stone. If i was a Villa fan i wouldn't want him anywhere near my club.
The best manager in their 9 year history 👍🏻🧟‍♂️ Feed the weegies let them know it’s Christmas time!
As a celtic fan il not miss him in the spl he could take any team by the kneck and win the spl he has that auroa behind him all the best
He's moving in with brendan Rodgers all Tim's together
People's comments are ridiculous, Stevie g put u bk on the map yet there's Gers fans saying he wasn't all that lol salty
That lad is saying Stevie G needs a couple of Windows. Ud think a man with his career would have all the windows he needs.
BYE BYE STEVIE.
What did Steve g, have,  only Liverpool regrets......klop won SEVCO the title...Callum Davidson  won more.
Let himself down. Not a legend. If you think villa are bigger then your a dreamer the league bigger but not the club. We are the people.🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👏👏👏👏Super frankie lampard keep it in the family cfc.
55 league titles? how can rangers keep the history are they not a new club? the previous not go bankrupt? someone explain this lol
He had to take it because you don't get to choose when a position becomes available,still getting relegated
A legend? I don't think so. Walter Smith certainly. Gerrard could not even lift a cup in a poor league.
Stevie  G used to have a soft spot for the hoops then he went to the dark side. He swore he would never leave but fucked off for the Thrilla with Villa. The Scouse Mo Johnston
He was always going to get off Nice Catholic lad like Steven  He loves Celtic  and to be fair The Scottish League is a Disgrace by far the Worst League in Europe if not the world an absolute Disgrace  Boring seen better Sunday league Pub football  DISGRACE OF A LEAGUE
I don't support Rangers or AVFC but fans need to remember that managers and players are guns for hire. With a few exceptions they have no allegiance to the club that employs them, and if a better offer comes along then most of them will leave without a backward glance.
We just need to get over it and look forward to a new era.   Gerrard obviously thinks this is a great career move. Regardless of what he does at Villa, he might be pinching himself when he hears the Champions League music grace Ibrox again next season.
I think the krankies or   Peter Capaldi should get the job 😂
He done his job and he moved on , it happens all the time in football unfortunately for Scotland we are just a stepping stone . The hate the guy is getting is unreal and uncalled for imo , all the best to him
Don't worry Rangers I have recommended Steve Bruce as your new number one man. "GIve me a pound or you're gonna get stabbed". 🙂👍⚽️
There a massive club. But in Scottish football. Which unfortunately. Isn’t on the level of English. Rangers are a smaller club status wise than Villa and Liverpool.
I'm surprised Rangers are bigger than Villa plus you have champions league. I'm confused ⚽️
He's done tremendous work at Rangers and halted Celtic's dominance. For that reason only Rangers fans will be grateful. It's disappointing he's left midway through the season but that's pretty normal really. He obviously wants to be challenged in a far more competitive league and hopefully eventually earn the Liverpool job. Personally I think he should've stayed at Rangers another season or two but I hope he succeeds at Villa.
Big girls he literally won two titles after 10 years you can’t complain
Money is bigger than rangers fc
Sevco was always a stepping stone to a far bigger club
Why does a geordie support rangers?? Weird
Gerrard never put Rangers on the map Rangers are more famous than Gerrard or any player for that matter.
"Everyone has to prove themselves before they come to Rangers " Were Rangers not Stevie Gs first job ????look if he wants the Liverpool job he has to do it in the big boys leauge first  not that tinpot of a thing they have the cheek to call a leauge .
Hes only won two cups? Slippy won none
It wasn't demotion or relegation, it was LIQUIDATION,  new clubs can't start anywhere other than the bottom
I don't understand the logic coming fae a solely football perspective. I think he has done us a wrong turn. A rat? Aye, after the promises, the silence, no statements...kept us aw waiting for what? To go down to (with) Villa! That is not the way to get to Klopp's job. He'd have been better off up here, coated and then leaving wi a couple of titles and a few cups. Fan support woulda seen him go straight from Ibrox to Liverpool when Klopp leaves. Instead, he's going to Aston Villa, ffs, I know we got demoted but that mob were relegated for playing horrendous football. i stayed down In Brum at the time, used to go to Wolves cos the Brum teams were so shite to watch. And Villa... Just lost their captain, their main man. I tend to see Villa as a stepping stone down the way. 'Steven Gerrard, Tranmere Rovers Manager, Season 2022/2023' *Sorry, new manager? Gotta agree wi the big yin - Lampard - he hasn't turned down that Norwich job for nothing and he is the correct sized personality at this time - we still need a manager who can attract top quality players and although Gio can do that, he really done himself a mischief by fucking off to China. If he came to the UK, he'd be on an MI5 watch list ffs. Wee Rino? what can a say? Loved the man, loved his playing style, but he just hasni earned enough tokens for Rangers. As for the size of Rangers compared to Villa...As big Hartson said, "Rangers could fit Villa in their pocket!" On average, Stevie G tied with Mr Struth in terms of percentage of wins. Aye, he was THAT good, especially last season. Third best Rangers manager in history, based on win averages... Super Ally! Wee bone to chew on. Would they? Could they? WOULD HE? Certainly a big enough personality but I just think it would be pure Rangers to gee the guy the chance he worked so hard for, and pure McCoist to put it in the top corner! But would he have this, and that, and also whatever else... Outsider for me. Still sticking wi Lampard and then Gio however! Whatever the fuck happens, we're Rangers. We are Scotland's champions and we are top of the league. This season, in terms of finance, is as important, in football terms, as last season - stopping them win their tainted ten in a row!
The whole episode about Stevie is the timing!!!!!!! Everyone is upset because of the timing!!! Just be thankful to him after 3 years of excellent services. It's not a stepping stone please, a big club in the premier league came with an offer, so why must he reject it? it's not Fulham, Crystal Palace, Burnley or even Leicester city, these are small clubs. Aston Villa IS a big club with very rich history and owned by very rich owners who can splash the cash. Can Rangers board splash the cash? Can Rangers buy a 30 millions player? He did better than Brendan rogers who jump ship to a smaller Premier league club and that's an insult.
LAMPARD IS THE MAN, US BLUES BROTHERS STICK TOGETHER NO SURRENDER GOD SAVE OUR QUEEN..
😂😂😂
Let's hope Van Bronckhorst gets the job
Came as a massive shock to me because he genuinely looked comfortable at Rangers, got them a decent foothold whilst Celtic imploded and with both a cup semi-final and a must-win Europa league game coming up, I didn’t think it would take so little effort for him to go. Not saying rangers are gonna fall apart on the calibre of Celtic’s 9IAR season but I’m not entirely convinced they’ll cruise like they did before either.
He's probably tried of the bitterness up there.
I don’t get why he couldn’t stay until the end of the season. Fact he was sat down a couple weeks ago and said he was happy and got us thinking he was happy to stay and then jumps ship just like that. Leaving the way he did is very snake like and I certainly hope he realises how he left was very unprofessional, I’m sure loads of us rangers fans are upset by this because he shouldn’t have left how he did. I can understand why people are calling him a rat ect but at the end of the day Gerrard will go where money talks. Let’s get someone in who’s done amazing with bringing teams up the leagues and get him in and not play about. Let’s not do what Celtic struggled to do with getting another manager in. Let’s get this manager, get the boys whipped and get our 56th league win. Fuck Gerrard he is in the past now and has shown himself to be a snake but let’s forget him and move onto the future which will be 56 times champions
the fact is , he won one trophy out of nine .,so i wouldn’t say he was fantastic … im greatfull he stopped ten in a row , and it will be a big miss for Scottish football , because he’s obviously a massive name in world football . I went to Rangers v Aberdeen a couple of weeks ago , and they were terrible , so maybe its best all round . I’d happily take £3m compensation and GVB , who has a much better cv than Gerrard .
To much of a pull from down south seen it wit Rodgers at Celtic both r massive clubs but he wants to see how far he can go in prem
Gerrard will get sacked by villa within 2 seasons
Slippy gee is a loser 90% of completions entered in Scotland he lost .. get it up ye sevco one title .. a like villa but god help youz
"everyone has to of proved themselves if they're to come to rangers" steven gerrard literally walked in at rangers with no experience...
So an Arsenal Dad buys a mystery box shirt for his son. His son opens the box, and it's a Spurs shirt.
Gio or Reno !  may be Larson  ,doing well
I think the main reason is family. I think his wife put pressure on him when the villa job came in. I was very angry on Thursday but now I've had a couple of days to calm down, I understand it just wish the timing was better but he cany control when an offer comes in. I think he'll maybe come to regret it in years to come as villa isn't like rangers with atmosphere etc. I think GVB will come in and I think we'll still win the title
He's just done a brendon Rodgers on rangers. It's so funny how quick they turned against Gerrard
😂😂😂😂😂  Left for a bigger club in a bigger league that will give him quicker much needed experience.  May as well manage the butcher's arms if you're gonna compete in a two team league playing each other 36 times.
You know what you can get to fck to
Rats a bit much no ?
I have a bad feeling that Steven Gerrard's appointment at Aston Villa could be a disaster.
As a Liverpool fan, I wish he stayed at Rangers till the end of the season and maybe get a 2nd title under his managerial belt. If he fails at Villa and gets sacked, it'll probably dent his ambition to manage Liverpool in the future and he'll end up being championship at best. Should have maybe went from Rangers to a championship side first and worked up to the PL from there, like Lampard with Derby. But who am I lol
How can you say you have to prove yourself before coming to Rangers when Rangers was SG first club? Souness was the same
The huns should give the job to a random pigeon walking around outside that shoebox ground that they dont even own, stick a hun tie around its gizzard and guide it to the dugout...🤣
Well known fact..English sack managers every week..
"Why leave just now", says shaggy, its because your team are dung shaggy, now, get yourself home and feed scooby doo ya clown!
Villa aren’t a bigger club they’re just in a bigger league. Van bronckhorst will take over and we will be better off for it.
Thank you so much Steven Gerrard for all the hard work you put in to the famous Glasgow Rangers. You are and always will be a legend. Good luck in your new job 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Well if anything the reporter made me laugh. Liverpool fan yeah sure, his scouse accent was that thick I couldn't understand a word he was saying. Another gobshite who's probably only done the stadium tour.
1 trophy out of 9 😂 Thank you Slippy!
The first guy was a class act give him the job 👏
Fan with the beard looks like him
Want last season Davidsons first as head coach at St Johnston
Blessing in disguise.
He ain't that good a manager Poor league £30 million in transfers and one trophy won Villa average team better league and he's gonni struggle
Stevie's a Judas. Only Mercenaries in the game these days. Big shit eating grin holding up a Villa shirt before the spunk on his contract is dry.
Another Liverpool fan without a Liverpool accent
Callum Davidson not a better shout than Barry Ferguson?
Stevey G had to leave sometime been there over 3 years you can't moan at that and done a better job than alot of the ex mangers.
Ranger's are shit!!!! in denial thinking they are big in any way.  1 cup winners cup BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
If you were a manager and was offered that money you'd take it and don't say you wouldn't because it would only make your management career better
Always follow the money or the lack of it, Gerrard’s lofty ambitions as a top flight manager would have been set back if he’d stayed at Rangers for the simple reason not only do they not have any money to strengthen the squad but they’ll more than likely have to sell at least 3 of their top players to see out the season , it’ll be possible for them to dig deep and finish on top which would be a life saver but the odds of that happening with a depleted squad are slim to none . The only thing that could save Rangers now is a billionaire with wealth off the scale like White 😉.
F.T.Q
Calum Davidson won 2 trophies - Gerard won 1 - but Davidson hasnt proved himself??
Calum Davidson 2 Trophies 🏆🏆 Slippy Gerrard 1 trophy 🏆
You can never take away from what Gerrard achieved in getting 55 but to be fair things have not felt right this season , what with letting in an early goal just about every match and some poor results to go with it . I'd like to see Frank Lampard but failing that they should give John Terry a go .
It isn't disrespectful to say Villa are bigger than Rangers. It's just a statement of fact.
The only worry I have is that we now have more tarriers talking about the champions that the actual gers fans 🤦🏻‍♂️ good tae see how much of an impact on the lives of so many unwashed we are having. We are definitely the people 🇬🇧NS
He should've stayed till at least end of the season to win the league and get us into the champions league
He should of stayed till the end of season
Culture Vultures the English, not to many moons ago they had signs up about the Irish now they all call all their kids Conor Sean Kieran 😂 couldnt like them if you gave birth to them. Sweet Caroline is Northern Irelands chant you Cultural Imperialists stop bringing in half the middle east and Africa and you could still sing Rule Britannia and you wouldnt have to squabble stealing other peoples identities.
I think Gerrard should have stayed at least till the end of the season, makes it look like he will dump any team for another job, instead of showing some kind of commitment to a club who gave him a chance, can you ever trust him
Is there any Liverpool fans from Liverpool.....villa will be a poison chalice.....
Four minutes for you to start doing what the title of the video says you'll do. Come on man.
I think Gerrard would need a fair bit more coaching experience, and proven success, before he would be considered to be a candidate for the Liverpool job, i mean really we have no idea how good a manager he is, Liverpool don't appoint managers that don't have a proven record.
It's between Lamps and Gio.  No Neil  No absolutely no to McInnes  Davidson would have an outside chance  But as that man said we need a big personality and Frank Lampard would definitely being it.
Sorry .. no loyalty
First guy was speaking heavy sense.
I think you may have lost the plot a bit if you think Steven Gerrard made Rangers bigger worldwide.  I say this as a non Rangers fan.
Rangers would blend well as a championship team but EPL would expose their frailties.
Aston Villa will win the league
Callum Davidson has only won 2 cups. That’s one more that Gerrard did at Rangers
Mate........ RANGERS PUT STEVY G ON THE MAP YA DICK.  Who was Steven when he left liverpool.  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿RANGERS🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 put steven back on the map 💯
Maybe he left cause your club and league is irrelevant
Steven Gerrard Gerrard Leaving Made The Bears Mad Bring In Gio & We'll Be Glad Fuck Steven Gerrard Gerrard   Onwards & Upwards   WATP 🇬🇧
Texas governor Greg Abbott signed on June 7, 2021, a state resolution, condemning the atrocities of forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in China.  The resolution noted that since the Chinese Communist Party launched the nationwide persecution campaign designed to eradicate the spiritual discipline Falun Gong in July 1999, its practitioners have been the “primary victims of forced organ removal” while facing “an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody,” according to a 2015 report by non-governmental organization Freedom House.  The resolution urges the U.S. government to prohibit “collaboration between U.S. medical and pharmaceutical companies” and ban the entry of and prosecute those who are engaged in forced organ harvesting.  The resolution was introduced by state senators Angela Paxton, Donna Campbell and Lois Kolkhorst in early 2021. Another nine senators cosponsored it. In the House, the resolution had four primary sponsors, including state representatives Matthew Shaheen, Armando Martinez, Jake Ellzey and Tom Oliverson, as well as seven cosponsors. It was adopted by the Senate on April 15 and passed in the House on May 20 before being sent to the governor's desk.
I have mixed feeling,  yes I am upset he left mid season.  I do appreciate the job he has done for us.  As Ally McCoist said his timing was not ideal.
Steven gerrard the only man to ever win 55 league titles in one season😂😂😂😂😂
Rats and snakes abound at Ibrox … look at Jack and others. Delusional club and supporters who have won nothing of any substance for more than half a century. A step up for the slippy one no doubt … he looks very happy at Villa, so ask no stupid questions of him this early in his tenure.
god e glasgow is he fuck.1 cup.in 9 hs a fkin mug.GLADLY  gna watch that shite relegated!!Villa u having a laff!!! 😂😂😂😂
He's definitely left Rangers in a far better position than it was in when he took over.
Not demotion, nor relegation.  It was administration and then liquidation. Come on 'footy adventure' don't get caught up in the lies. It wasn't 55 titles, it was their 1st!!
Good luck to Stephen Gerrard at Aston Villa
£50m spent to win £3m league Club close to bankruptcy
YAWWWNNN ! Boring  intro
Let’s be honest , Scottish football is a dead end for ambitious players and managers
“ Stevie G” wtf LOL
He's done us over with this. Gutted with Steve g  leaving before Xmas with league so tight. Should have left in summer or seen season out. Just hope Gerrard takes goldson with him
Gerrard is a legend for Rangers and we struck gold getting him, we were so lucky and would never have stopped 10 in row without him, he came and done 99% of what Rangers fans had in their wildest dreams, best of luck to him and I’ll cherish Gerard’s 55 invincibles.
Gutted man. Widda wished him well at end of season but to leave now!!!! With the league so close, a chance of winning a cup n possibly get into the 3rd tier euro final. Absolutely gutted. He would have got villa job next summer. Fs he woulda got a better job in summer. Can't believe he's left us in this situation. As I said would hav wished him well at end of season but to leave now???!!! Hope he gets relegated. Gio would use us as a stepping stone to arsenal  I think lamps would commit long term
❗The word Islam means peace and submission. Muslims greet each other by saying 'Salaam alaykum' meaning 'peace be upon you'. , the majority of Muslims believe in seeking a just and peaceful world. The Qur'an teaches that Allah wants Muslims to control their aggression and approach others with peace.  {Do not let your hatred of people incite you to aggression}.ref/Qur’an 5:3)  The Qur'an For Muslims the Qur'an is of supreme importance because it is the direct words of Allah to humankind, and it is therefore treated with great respect. The Qur'an often refers to teachings about peace and reconciliation:  {Paradise is for…those who curb their anger and forgive their fellow men.}Ref/Qur'an 3:134     --------------------------------------------------------- {Do not kill a soul which Allah has made sacred except through due process of law.} ref/Qur'an 6:51    This quote suggests that Muslims should only kill if it can be justified under Islamic law because human life is precious and belongs to Allah.  Killing of any other kind is one of the greatest sins in Islam. These sins will be judged by Allah on the Day of Judgement.  Hadith In the Hadith the Prophet Muhammad teaches that maintaining peace and good relations is very important and that Muslims should not get carried away with feelings of hatred towards others:  {Do you know what is better than charity and fasting and prayer?

Islam teaches that reconciliation is of great importance.  Peace is central to Islam and the religion aims to achieve a world without attack, conflict or unjust rulers. A peaceful solution to any situation of conflict must be sought and if an enemy offers peace Muslims should accept it.

This belief is clearly expressed in the following verse:  {If the enemy inclines towards peace, then you should also incline towards peace and trust in Allah, for He is the One that hears and knows all.} ref/Qur'an 8:61  Islam teaches that prejudice and discrimination of any kind are wrong, because we are all creations of Allah and are therefore equal.  Some Muslims refuse to fight in contemporary wars because they believe that with modern warfare there can be no such thing as a just war.

Shows the difference in Scottish football to English football if villa are bigger than rangers 😂
Can’t blame him for wanting to be nearer his family. 3 half years away from your wife and kids is a lot to ask. He’s gone now we move on to the next chapter. We’re Glasgow Rangers we don’t dwell on individuals bigger people than Steven Gerrard have come and gone. Let’s get the new management team in and get 56 🇬🇧🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Some Rangers fan's are ungrateful mong's. They couldn't even finish above Aberdeen with a crap squad losing to Celtic comfortably. He's left them having won the league built a much better squad, able to beat Celtic, leaving them top of the league and doing better in Europe. I'd imagine Villa wanted Gerrard and either wouldn't wait or Gerrard wanted the job and felt he could do better than the current Villa manager.
Demotion through the Divisions??? Try Liquidation. Players freed from their contracts. Brand new club starting again from the bottom division.
Stevie just slipped away as usual!
There they go 1 in a row
Lampard isn't coming to Rangers but instead is in the process of tying up the loose ends to become the new manager at Norwich City.  According to reports earlier today, Derek McInnes isn't really under consideration for the Rangers manager's job this time around.
Alex Neil is also a Celtic fan, I don't really imagine that he would want to manage Rangers nor do I believe that he's of Rangers calibre. Plus at no point have I ever had any real kind of vibe from Alex Neil that he would actually be open to or want to manage either side of the Old Firm.
Good riddance..going to a better club..pulling my plonker..good luck at Villa he will need it
The reason Slippy G left was because he seen the books and realised that rangers will have to sell most their players. 😂 I also see Rangers advertising they won the cup winners cup 😂😂😂 oh the laughter
Gerrard at Villa, I don't dislike him but I am a little disappointed at the manner in which he left and how quickly.  Villa are a club with a huge history but the highest finish I would foresee is 3rd in the English Premier League but that would be after 2 or 3 transfer windows. But more realistically 5th, 6th, 7th or 8th.  I expect that he will move for Tavernier and Kamara. Possibly Ryan Kent. He may move for Morelos but I wouldn't really expect it because I think his temperament and discipline might prove to be a barrier to him moving to Aston Villa.
Gerrard put rangers on the map? You mad?
John Hartson said it right when he said that Rangers could put Aston Villa in their back pocket.  That said, I don't really think it's the size of the club that Gerrard has gone for but to get some good experience managing against higher calibre opponents on a more regular basis in order to help prepare him for the Liverpool manager's job because Klopp is leaving in 2024.
Rangers and celtic join the epl you are otherwise irrelevant
“Why would he go to Norwich” where’s this guy been the past week
Switched off at “demotion through the divisions” Can you please explain after their positional finish in 2012 , what mechanism was in place for this to be done . They were not “demoted through the divisions “ but ceased to be , as the club as an entity WAS the company in incorporation . As this company went into administration ( never came out ) and is currently still in the process of being liquidated ..
In sure they said he’d only leave for Liverpool 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
a real young stephen mulhern, keep it up.
There is more too this , SG isnt the type of guy IMO to lead Rangers supporters on ,  and that remark he made about being happy , i believe was the case at that time . This has blown up pretty quickly  ( whatever the reason )  and because of the timing  people are angry  there is  no doubt about that .  Time sorts stuff out and Rangers will move on , the one caveat  is that Gerard  doesnt try and take  the cream of this  Rangers team , if he does...........Villa arent far enough away for him . I hope Gio gets the Gig.....he knows what Rangers are about and has a v good CV .
Talks a lot of sense and not bitter - fair play
Gerrard did a good job at Glasgow Rangers. I hope he does well at Villa.  My choice for Rangers manager would be Derek McInnes. McInnes did a great job at Aberdeen FC. He won a League Cup, and was second place in the league for four years in a row. He developed great players like Jack, Wright, McKenna, McLean, Maddison, Shinnie, Cosgrove and Hayes. He did well at Aberdeen. I think he could do superbly at Rangers.  Give a former Rangers player a chance. Thanks.
As an Englishman you’re a neutral? Why? Rangers fans are pro-British and generally pro-English, whereas Celtic are the complete opposite
2.03. The word you’re looking for is liquidation! Rangers were not relegated or demoted. They ceased to exist and the company and team that were formed from their ashes were granted permission to enter the Scottish Professional Football League at the bottom tier, as any new club would have to do. Small point, but important to note.
The guy at 10.32 had an electric shock because of Gerard's departure. It gave him a new hairstyle,
“Demotion or relegation or whatever you want to call it” both wrong. 1. Sevco5088 had to apply for a license to join the Scottish league which was granted and so like any new club they started in the bottom tier. 2. both sevco5088 and Rangers held memberships at the same time until Rangers football club lost their membership. 3. The team you are watching play at ibrox now where sevco5088 but that has since been changed to Rangers international football club, they don’t seem to use the international though 🤷‍♂️
No one`s bigger than rangers football club ???? "of course" was the reply from you  ? Lmao !   really mate yous won one League title in the last 10 years celtic had players out with injury`s and covid when you won that title now Ange is breathing down Gerrard`s neck and he abandon`s ship so don`t give us all that nonsense about no one`s bigger than rangers we`re glasgow celtic Hail Hail !
A legend. No. He won 1 trophy in 3 and a half years. Does that make lennon a god
Villa's a big club geeze peace, more fans at ibrox in 4th tier of scottish football than villa park in the EPL .
dont cry because its over,,,be happy that it happened  !!!!!!! get it up ye ya blackneck mutant hun fucks !!!!!  COYBIG
I think Stevie g will do well at Villa in the longer term Villa have a good squad but he needs to get rid of Mings .
Everyone has to prove themselves b4 they come 2 rangers....slippy g wonders in to Govan having proved himself were? Uneducated knuckle draggers!
Thank you Steven Gerrard for stopping Celtic winning 10 in a row.  Some Rangers fans have short memories. Remember the state we were in before he took charge?  Giovanni Van Bronkhorst for me. WE ARE THE PEOPLE 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 🇬🇧
Maybe wrong here but didn't Rangers beat Celtic in a scottish cup semi final a season or two before Gerrard signed ?
it's considered a stepping stone because with all due respect mate he has about 3 or 4 tough games a season in scotland whereas the premier league has the best coaches in the world and if he is ever to get the liverpool job he will have to weather himself in the league.. brendan rodgers ruthlessly dominated in scotland but is finding the top 4 extremely difficult to break and he appears no closer now than when he took over at leicester, steven gerrard can win a league at rangers but that does not mean villa are even guaranteed to survive under him such is the quality throughout the league.. if he does well at villa the scousers will genuinely take interest but he can stay and win the league every season with rangers n they will still be unsure whether he is ready
Strong Scouse accent for this Liverpool fan.
How can you be a legend with just one title win? More puffed up nonsense from the football community.
Are rangers and Celtic really massive clubs if they was only two teams in Germany England Spain and France can you imagine the attendance
keep up the work mate
Call in Duncan Ferguson
The de board  brothers
I pissed myself laughing
I think Gerrard would be glad to get back down to the Midlands where he's from and could he easily commute from Liverpool to Birmingham.
‘Callum Davidson only won 2 cups’   Gerrard won 1 😭
Callum Davidson deserves way more credit.
We should really get a statue of mr gerrard what he done for us or a stand named after him 💙💙
Duncan Ferguson wi Gazza as his assistant
Like to see Duncsn Ferguson 👍
Good luck to steven gerrard at aston villa, gerrard took over at rangers and got them back to where they belong, got them back to being the top team in scotland again, qualified for europe four season in a row, stopped celtic from gettin ten in a row, gerrard done what he had to do, yes he only won the 1 trophy out of 9, but that one trophy he delivered was the main trophy we all wanted, so best of luck in the future, will always be a legend in the blue half of glasgow
First guy interviewed hadn’t got a clue haha. Callum Davidson won 2 trophies in his first season in charge. Gerrard has 1 trophy in 3 seasons hahahhaha
Davidson has won more that gerrard in his whole time in Scotland 😂😂
up the villa UTV  gday from Adelaide Australia
Well... I think we all knew this would get a few views. 🙂
Most successful club in the world!? Actual HAHAHAHA. Sure theres a primary school somewhere with more titles. You can win all the small trophies you like - doesn’t make you more successful than Man Utd, Liverpool, Madrid, Barca etc, even Celtic have won the European Cup. C’mon!! One of the big 2 Scottish clubs - but yer far from the most successful club in the world. Awful patter.
Good luck Steven Gerrard at Villa. God bless from a Celtic fan, God bless from the USA
Aston Villa New Coach Why
He signed for the club when they were still 15 points off of Celtic. He managed to bring the title back and to stop the enemies 10th league in a row with a 25 point gap, not to mention the Europa League run last season. He galvanised the club and in 3 years turned them into a side of invincibles. He done all of this whilst spending the majority of his weeks away from his family. This was also a major risk for him, his first job in management. As a Rangers fan it saddens me, but the resources at Villa are larger, he’s closer to his family, and it’s a progression in his career after everything he’s put in over the last 3 years. The first fan speaks for the majority of the club.   It boils down to this, you’re working in a position that you enjoy, but another company comes along and offers you more money, more resources, and you’re an hours drive from your family instead of 4. No brainier. Good luck Stevie G and thank you for 55.   Just imagine
Nice one m8, Gerrard was class right up until Monday, bad move.
money money money,,
Massive club. 😂😂 And how can you class slippy G as a legend. He might of stopped up getting 10 in a row. But before that what did the filth win. Rangers are nowhere near as better than us. So keep dreaming. You should get Dean Smith or the other rat Frank lampard. But your still be shit. Gerrard only won you the league and nothing else. But don't worry whilst your looking for a new manager. We have our man ange. Good luck slippy G 😂😂😂  We
55 league titles ha ha ha ya club died
Rangers died no history. Slippy walked in to a job that they were building for 9 years previous
U don't sound scouse
Rangers were not demoted or relegated. They were not put down the leagues. They were liquidated. ‘The Rangers (Sevco 5088)’ were ‘put’ into the lowest Scottish league as a new club.
He done the job he came to do, end of. Good luck to him. 🔴⚪🔵👌
Garry Mac should be the man to finish the season for me
Best result Celtic will get this season. Oh and in some parts of Birmingham, AV aren't as big a club as Rangers!
There is nothing more entertaining about British football than fans from Scotland pretending that a manager leaving a second-rate backwater league for the most popular and competitive league in the world is a scandal or some sort of betrayal. Rangers are a second-rate club who got glory from a coach who knows when it's time to move on. Get back to beating Hamilton Academical, you're embarrassing yourselves.
Jumped ship a season to early. Should of won back to back titles with rangers. He will get found out at villa very quickly.
Lol lol lol lol lol lol lol etc......
There ya go Stevie Gerrard has left and as soon as a decent job became available in the Prem then he would be off but The Gers will find another Manager Easily Rangers are still growing
Announce McInness
Folk need to get a grip. He always had to prove himself in the epl before he tries Liverpool. We are top, in a semi final, can still progress in Europe and Gio will be in before the players return from international duty. Villa are not as big as Rangers but he always had to go back to the EPL...
What must Gary Mc.be thinking going to training with Rangers. Waking up and going training with shitty villa. Thanks Stevie lol
One hit wonder slips out of Glasgow
Mixed feelings to be honest yeah he did a job for us bit on the other still did a Brendan and did the old turn coat traitor act at international break without informing players or other staff and fans lets be honest here that's bad management by him and not the sort of boss you want ,fake words at end of day could have left as a hero from inbox now will be remember as a traitor to club and fans this season.  🤣🤣Villa tae ffs Rangers and celtic could fit them in there pockets in terms of everything including world wide fan base no get 3 season to win in pl and villa wont make top 5 in next 6 season atleast but aw the best wee man 👍
First guy balanced impartial view fair play
Why would you leave a special club with special fans. For a run of the mill premier club. What a waste
3 mins talking to 3 fans, the rest of the video you talking shite
Aston villa jerseys are made by kappa on 41 Bobby sands street...
Proving u can mange in the PL is different then the SPL so it is a stepping stone, not based on clubs but leagues and u cant expect a job to be available like villa at then end of the season, u have to take it when its there. Steve has ambition and thats tough to swallow for some rangers fans
Frank Lampard has been mentioned but it's looking increasingly likely that he is going to take the Norwich City manager's job.  John Terry has also been linked but I honestly hope that Rangers do not approach him as we can well do without his type at Rangers. If you don't know what I mean then just look at his relationships with Wayne Bridge & Rio Ferdinand.
Top few names in the running to replace Gerrard:  1) Giovanni Van Bronckhorst Dutch international midfielder who played with Rangers under Advocaat, played for Arsenal & Barcelona as well as The Netherlands. GVB has already managed Feyenoord & Guangzhou in China.  2) Derek McInnes played for Greenock Morton, Rangers, West Bromwich Albion. Managed St Johnstone and Aberdeen.  3) Genarro "Rino" Gattuso Italian international midfielder played for Sampdoria, Rangers and AC Milan. Has also managed AC Milan and is at another Serie A club.  Other names in the frame: Dean Smith, Steve Bruce, Mark Hughes, Daniel Farke, Frank de Boer, Ronald Koeman, Ronald de Boer, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Jack Ross, Robbie Neilson and Callum Davidson.
BIG ANGE WIZ COMIN FOR HIM🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🍀🍀🍀🍀
He's won you the league.. what else do you want? You can't expect him to stay there for a long time.
were you born in english or scotland?
As a Villa supporter I think we needed him. I just hope he sorts the midfield sharpish.  Sad as I like Dean Smith but tactically no. Thanks Rangers👍  P.s If anything I admire his fight and courage as we are in trouble. We dont mind our scousers in Bham.
Club is bigger than Gerrard
Ole would be perfect for Rangers.
Do I have an issue with Stevie G leaving, NO.  DO I have an issue in the way Stevie G departed? ABSOLUTELY.  Yes it’s a mixed bag of some are happy for him and some are calling him a rat. What the issue is, is lack of respect from the rangers board and Stevie G respectably. You don’t leave a club like rangers and the fan base, with out saying good bye and thanks for the support. The only thing you actually see is Stevie G holding an Aston Villa top.  This is a low and undermining move and both the Rangers board and Stevie G with his staff should feel guilt about the decision and how it was carried out. Disgraceful.
Most fans are so bitter. I knew he'd leave sooner or later
Rangers will be fine, they’re in an absolute shit league, a 4 year old could be their manager and they’d still win it,
That first guy man 😂 Callum Davidson has won more trophies at st Johnstone in less time than gerrard at rangers 😂
Fair play to this plumb being an Englishman going upto Glasgow on his own talking to himself with his phone…..I’m subscribing to see when you get mugged.
Im gutted S G has gone. I wish him all the best he lifted Rangers up to a glorious 55. At the end of the day we need a manager to carry on the momentum he created. I am on the other side of the world in New Zealand been a Rangers fan for 70 years. Love this club. WATP.
I do think it’s put of order him just up and gone just like that. Personally he should have finished this season. He is just 41, there is litrally no rush for him at all. He is kind of a rat for doing it to rangers but at the same time he has left rangers in a very healthy position. Top of the table semi final coming up and still the best team in the league.
In terms of 'size' it seems clear to me that there are a LOT more Rangers fans globally than there are Villa fans globally. On that basis you could also argue that both Old Firm clubs have much larger fan demographics than Man City, Chelsea or Tottenham. Using any sort of economic measure however, and the English clubs completely dwarf the revenues, turnover and wages of both Celtic and Rangers. Sad to say that money talks at the end of the day. I wish Gerrard well. He's been a good ambassador for Scottish football and if there's a litmus test of how successful a departing manager has been, it's surely the swathes of their fan-base who now think he's betrayed them.
Firstly,  I'm not a Rangers fan. However  I'm disappointed that Gérard has left Rangers. I don't see him as a Legend, had he stayed a few more seasons, won more titles, cups and done well in Europe then there's a chance of legendary status. I think he'll do OK at Villa, but depends on who he brings in and how long he gets. I think Rangers are run better that Celtic and won't take 4 months to bring in a replacement.  I think they'll have a new Manager by next week.   He didn't leave Rangers for Villa, he left SPL for the EPL. If Rangers and Celtic joined the EPL, they would be the biggest clubs in the league (after a few seasons) make no mistake. They are Blue Whales 🐳  in a fish pond.
Questionable manager who only won one competition (in a very weird season). Aston Villa fans should be worried.
Id love to see sol campbell rangers maneger
I don't see wot Stevie G hopes to achieve at Villa other than using it as a stepping stone. Not that I see it as that, I see it as a massive backward step! If I were a Villa fan I'd be feeling used already. Shud've stayed at Rangers until a foreign job came up or his destiny the manager of Liverpool.
Whats the chances of dave Courtney being outside of ibrox today
SPL is just a stop off for decent manager , that’s the bottom line , money talks and the SPL is not even able to compete with the Championship when it comes to money
Daniel Farke mark my words
To be honest as a rangers fans feel this season was heading for a train crash rangers have been wrong since clincing the title against st mirren feel this season europe has been a disaster this term and now maybe the untouchables in the rangers squad will need to up their game just feel the team has the same feel as the dubia winter break disaster is i a "we stopped the ten job done"
Most successful club in the world 😂 In Scotland.
Who cares?
Well it’s just the natural process in football.
Ronald de boar or geovarni Michael laudrop
I would love it to see Big Dunc leaving Everton for Rangers. That would be interesting!!
The guy guy is a loonball. Gerrard wins one trophy in 3 and a half years../god…Callum Davidson won 2 cups in a year…shite…./crackpot
UTV LADS GET INNNNN
Let’s face it the Scottish prem is shite any good manager wants to be competing in the best leagues just as good players want to compete in the best leagues if you’ve got any self belief an ambition yiur not going to want to stay up ther when Thers only 2 teams that are half decent if Celtic and reneges came down to England they would only be mid table teams at best so it’s understandable that he’s gone yes it’s only half way through but the job has came up now an if he doesn’t take it he mite not get the opportunity at the end of the season
Lampard or bronckhurst
Everyone has to prove himself !!??!!?? Before he comes !?!?! Gerrard first position  apart from 2nd team Liverpool boys level  tell that guy to smarten up Gerrard won one trophy in 3 years not exactly top notch in football get on your bike  Hail Hail
He did and was still doing a fantastic job for Rangers with his backroom staff. We all expected him at some point in the future to move South and possibly to his first love Liverpool, but for most of the supporters the timing is not right. He could get a top job in the premiership at any point in the season so why not see out this season. Win the title again, take Rangers into the Champions League and then, if he feels its a done job, pick a club down South. He could easily have said I'm committed to this season and the players would have fought as hard as last season to defend this title.
Calum Davidson only one 2 cups 👀
Callum for Rangers manager. Why not? I like Rangers more than Celtic since I was a little kid. Am almost 32 now. Maybe I have no right to say this as I'm from Belgium and a massive Arsenal fan (that likes Rangers in Scottish premierleague) but I see the St. Johnstone manager as a good one for Rangers.
Dean Smith to Rangers lol
Don’t worry rangers fans you will get big Sam 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rangers fans it’ was guaranteed he was always gonna move on unless you won the champions league or Europa league and you had more chance of doing that as getting struck by lightening
During the season? Come on...!
Kevin Muscat to manage Rangers, Ange v Kevin would make the Old Firm even more interesting.
I have alot more respect for Rangers watching your videos and seeing their ground as you walk round it. Think Villa is a big step down but Premier League is more prestigious competition with multi big matches every week.
“Do I look happy?” “Do I look settled?” “Don’t ask silly questions!”  S. Gerrard
On point as usual, managers sadly as fickle as clubs and fans, instant success the only modern plan ✌💙🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿⚪
by the way,good luck to aston villa ,they are a massive club and thats why stevie went there,been to villa park many times with my london club arsenal,great ground,great support great history,,all the best villains
hi my friend,dont worry about our football team,we are in a good place,hopefuly van bronkhurst or gatusso will step up,but who ever it is we will back them all the way,i am a true bear from e.london and all our bretherin around the world will support our team no matter who is manager,we are a great big british family,god bless mucker
Steve Bruce and Neil Warnock probably one of them.
As a Rangers fan for over 40 years I was gutted the way SG left, however,  I understand his family are down south and he'll get more money for his new team. I think it'll also scupper his dream of being a Liverpool manager now. You said your focus as a Liverpool fan won't be the same now from up here but just wait till we get Gianni Van Bronckhorst as manager. His CV is much better than Gerrard so optimistic for the future if this happens. Still a lot of drama to come from the Scottish league.
Snake like rodgers. First guy was funny callum Davidson has won more than slippy the snake
Neil warnock  or big Sam 🤔
Who would you rather manage an EPL club or Rangers tribute act? Sevco 5088 have made a loss for 7 years running pretty much. Horrible club and horrible supporters.
Well hell always be remembered for winning the rangers first ever title
The relevancy of Scottish football dips? Dearie me
rangers should attract the best now , that there the top in scottish football , there all the same anyways ,nice job to manage a club like rangers , and im irish ,there a serious club , dont think he will have the success in premiership , its very competitive . Good to see more british managers doing well , i like home grown talent . He helped rangers alot , it was quite a journey
He’s either a fenian in disguise is Stevie or Scottish football is and will always be pish.
First guy was a real one
The fans favourite seems to be GVB, which, wouldn’t be a bad appointment given what he achieved at Feyenoord. But, Rangers upper management have proved they are willing to take.risks, so, it’s all up in the air for a week or so and we’ll see what happens. It’s a difficult one to call. We’ve seen the Ange Postecoglou era starting to take shape with an unknown manager certainly in Scotland bearing some promising fruit, so, as far as Rangers go, it’s anyone’s guess at this point.
Rangers and Celtic will never be able to keep hold of talent or managers while they are in the spl. Villa are nowhere near as big a club as rangers but I get do play in the best league in the world . Has Gary McAllister left too ? I’ll take him as boss .
Van Bronkhorst definitely not a bigger name in British football but an established and respected career and titles won at Feyenoord means he may well be a better manager. 🇬🇧
Managing against Kilmarnock, Dundee etc, compared to Man City, Utd, etc, no brainer. And any man who would not do the same ............ .
All the best to the man but hes made maybe the biggest mistake in his manager career if he fails at villa thats him pretty much finished, maybe become a pundit at best, I’d love to have lampard but i doubt it
Personally wish him the best, though he's by no means left us runaway leaders. Worry about the coming weeks, but at the end of the day the gap between Rangers and Celtic is closing and he made the statement.
No ones bigger than Rangers fc ffs ronaldo is bigger than rangers, way bigger, rangers are a nobody just like celtic, and I'm irish, Scottish football is dead years now and will never recover unfortunately,  love the passion of the fans tbf, but some aren't realistic imo
One of the biggest clubs in the country 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 mate it's the Scottish league no one gives a shit about that league
Actually Warburton beat Celtic few years previous
Old Firm fans are a brainless bunch.  What is that first guy on?
I think Villa will be a bridge too far atm. If he'd continued to smash it for us since 55, fair enough. But something changed this season. And the fact that the dressing room were as shocked as us isn't good. How does he command that same respect? It is respect after all that got him off the ground with us. A risky move, he didn't need to take.
Frank Leonard will be the new Rangers manager.
I think Gerrard will do a lampard and be out of a job within 18 months, not all great footballers make great managers......
Great vid Sam. Gutted to see Gerrard go, especially at such an important point of a crucial season. I wish him all the best in his new job though. No bitterness here, just disappointment. I didn't think he was the type to leave his team in the lurch honestly. The thing that bothers me most is that Rangers only got just over £4 million compensation. Gerrard was worth a helluva lot more than that to us.
Didn’t get demoted. Lost football license due to liquidation and re entered league system as a new club. FACT.
Hope villa go down 🐍🐍🐍
As a Celtic fan this reminds me of when Brendan Rodgers left Celtic to join Leicester. Whoever takes up the job of management for rangers I’m sure the person will please the fans. I feel there’s going to be a lot of people angry at what has happened in ibrox
Gazza lol
He stopped 10 & for that reason I will be for ever Grateful. Aye , some Great name's being touted & quite rightly so.. it's really important we keep the togetherness & we keep a focus on the rest of this season/campaign.  Our potential new manager is still here, atleast to the end of season. Steven Davies.  Jermain Defoe.  The next chapter begins..🔴⚪🔵
The lure of the PL will always trump Scottish football however big the club and lets face it there are only two clubs in Scotland with any clout, we all know that.  That's why Lampard will go to Norwich above Rangers, money and Premier League. If Stevie G does well at Villa, (and that means finishing top half this season and challenging for Europa league next) he puts himself in the shop window for a bigger club or even England after Southgate.  Would he get that staying at Rangers? I don't think so.
Good riddance tae him
3 1/2 years with 1 trophy!! BYE 👋 👋 👋 👋 👋 👋 👋 👋 👋
Gerrard will always be a hero in my eyes. I wish him and the rest of the coaching staff well.
Loyalists proving they ain't loyal again lol
He bailed out knowing they are on the verge of SLIPPING up, Celtic are an improving team and within the next few weeks will be sitting on top of the league and that is regardless of who gets the rangers job.
No Celtic blew the 10IAR not slippy G
Lol be grateful that he won the Scottish prem league with rangers it was always going to happen no matter what
That first guy you spoke to... "I don't want Callum Davidson, he's only won 2 cups. What's that? Two cups! Don't want him!".... That's one more Cup than Gerrard every won (our of 9 attempts) hahaha. Sevco and their fans are the gift that keeps on giving 😅
Aston Villa are a bigger club than the shitty rangers and I’m sure you will not forget the beating villa gave Liverpool last year too lmao 😂
I like wish Steve g all best at new job hope one day see him back Liverpool as manger job
Neil Lennon ? Did stevie prove himself before getting the job.
Calum Davidsons only won 2 cups, Gerrards only won 1🤔🤣
He’ll have a chance to win promotion from the Championship next season.
Gerrard was a flop. The celtic board won him his only and sevco's one and only title in there 9 year history otherwise known as the covid cup.
Sorry but if you dont see Rangers to Villa as an upgrade, ur just wrong. Bigger transfer budget, Higher level opponents to test yourself, and better players. Rangers might be bigger than Villa but its all about the league and Villa is the perfect Club for Gerrard.
Aston villa will become crapton villa by the end of the season. I can see Gerrard looking for a new job before next season starts.
These imposters are a Rangers tribute act , they died in 2012
Gerrard is a Snake 🐍
Why are rangers not looking at Duncan Ferguson worked with quality managers wont take shit and knows the club
He won't win fuck all with villa, big step down
“Calum’s only won 2 cups, how long he been at st Johnstone ?” Calum joined st Johnstone 2 years after gerrard joined rangers and still won more cups than him. 😬
He should stay in Ranger to gain more valuable experiences before joining big teams.
As a Villa fan I really rate that Rangers fan that was first he was so positive. It’s tough losing someone that feels like your own we felt that with Grealish and Smith. I will always rate Rangers more than Celtic! 🇬🇧
Stop all the clocks, lower the flags, take the radical road to the top of the crags, put red and blue crêpe around the necks of white doves, let all of our stewards wear black cotton gloves, unfurl a banner from a low flying drone, with the awful announcement.. Stevie Is Gone!
Premier league is the biggest in the world so why not - gerrad
What did Rangers fabs expect lol. Rangers are the laughing stock of the world. They were in Division 3 a few years ago for cheating .
Gerrard left a bigger club in rangers and European football to go and fight a relegation battle. I don’t get it
“Callum’s only won two cups. How long’s he been there for?”  He’s barely been there two years as manager and won two cups. A better ratio than Gerrard 😂
Villa have had 6 managers in 6 years Stevie will have to hit the ground running I'm betting he's sacked before the end of the season not because of him but because villa won't give him the time.
only here for the hun tears 😂😂😂
Davy Moyes ? Who will be the next guy ?
Callum Davidson has won 2 cups  in his 1st season as manager with st Johnstone 2/3 slippy g at gers  won 1/9 😂😂😂
It is a stepping stone tho! Villa may not be bigger than rangers!  But the prem is bigger  than the Scottish  league (fact)  Doing well at rangers will not get you the Liverpool  job as its always a 2 horse race   Going to villa and doing bits is a stepping stone to Liverpool (if he's successful)  at villa
Yer man said Callum Davidson has proved nothing. Ok.. he won two cups in one season with zero budget.. Gerrard won one trophy in three years. Not saying Davidson is good enough to manage Rangers but come on. You cant say hes done nothing
Rangers only won the ramsdens Cup. Saints did the double.
I don't know what the Villa heirachy are expecting. They're not a top 10 side in my opinion now. Grealish carried that team.
What's that coming over the hill.....
Guy doesn't want Callum Davison cause hes only won 2 cups...  Gerrard only won 1 😂😂😂😂
Taking the piss, 🤣😂🤣legend of Glasgow🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣.
10:34. David turn it in you mate absolute sour grapes. He came in when you’s were absolute bums. Won you’s the league stopped celtic doin the tenth and your that bitter just because you said celtic will be laughing at you’s. There always laughing at you’s until he saved your club.
He's just ambitious.
Al-Ahly are the most successful team in the world don't let them feed you bullshit mate
Big mistake by Villa.
Van Bronckhorst or Lampard in. Missing Stevie already 😔
He’s no Rangers legend, disgusting way to leave the club that gave him his chance in management. Hope he ends up on the scrap heap when he fails at villa. Will never be welcomed back at ibrox.
Celtic man here. Would like to take this moment to thank Aston Villa. Up the Bhoys!!
Hope vile get relegated and us at birmingham take 6 points off them next season. Kro sotv. Up the blues and gers
Callum Davidson won 2 cups in his first season at st Johnstone. Gerrard won 1 in 3 years 😂😂😂
I can understand people are upset but it is much bigger club so is good move for him but if Liverpool ask him he will do same to villa
7 mins and 3 seconds in and an alarm went off....Just as you were leaving the vicinity. Coincidence?
I’m disappointed he and his staff are gone but the show goes on. They have left the club in a better state than when they found it. Ross Wilson has a big job now but I’m confident they’ll find the right man to take it on. Thanks Stevie.
Carra had it right on Sky earlier.  Rangers and Celtic are unlucky because even though both of them are massive clubs they happen to be in a very poor league. When you have the biggest league in the world in terms of viewers and money just south of the border it's inevitable that players and managers will move south not necessarily for a bigger club but for a bigger opportunity. I don't think Stevie moved because of Villa. I think he'd have taken the job at another club if it wasn't Villa. He moved because it's the Premier League.
Has he left Rangers bankrupt?
6:10 Callum Davidson has only won 2 cups in his 1st year as a manager lmao .. remind how many Slippy G won in 3 years??
I love Gerrard for what he done for us, can never take that away from him. I’m just disappointed at him as he claims to be a man of loyalty and all it took was a matter of days to have a complete change of heart, which makes me believe he was ready to jump at the first chance he could get of leaving. I can see why he left, better players, more money to spend etc  and I always knew it wouldn’t last forever but he could of waited till the end of the season to move on
these fans dont know shit about villa, created of the football leagues. Make the club much bigger.
Stopped 10 😂. Celtic stopped 10 there selves . Don’t forget COVID impacted us more than any other club
"callum davidsons only won 2 cups" more cups than stevie g 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Are you trynna say villa aren’t a massive club?
Hi. Sorry.
Rangers fans don't seem that disappointed. Toon fan here and I am happier with Howe, given our situation I can imagine Gerard struggling.
Would have thought he'd stay until the seasons end at the very least, I suppose it's the premier league and the chance of the Liverpool job. Villa is a miserable club at the best of times, speak to any of their supporters and they're some of the most dour miserable and boring people you could ever hope not to meet. Rangers has a real positive energy, villa is definitely a step backwards in terms of club...
It's a crying shame Celtic and Rangers aren't allowed in the EPL. Would be interesting to see what they could do with the budgets they get down there
You want to watch u dont get chipped around there la they only like scousers and geordies anyone else is the enemy believe me
Well,on paper Callum Davidson is the more successful manager!!
As a Celtic fan, he did the job that he was brought in for (to stop us winning 10 in a row) so fair play to him & he has made the team better.
Don’t know what to make of this.  A bit bitter today.  My heart loves him for stopping 10 in a row but brain says 1 trophy in 3.5 years against a collapsing Celtic when Rodger’s left.  Transfer window he wasn’t that impressive. More duds than good signings.   In Europe he done brilliant.
Rangers were never demoted or dropped down the divisions as you put it. The old club was liquidated after they refused to pay tax ( ironically during the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts ) and Her Majesty Revenue and Customs refused to accept the CVA. The old club died and a new club Sevco took over the membership ad had to apply to the SFA to play in the 3rd division.
No European football for him anymore. Should have stayed at rangers. Great fans. Big club. Being a Liverpool fan didn't want him managing another English club.
Football is a business. Managers are hired to be fired. Well done on your first response video. It’s the first in the news down her in Australia.
We will wait on time to see the difference between Scottish premier to English premier. How well a manager he is and his back stage staff. I wish him all the best
Mediocre clubs deserve mediocre managers
Must have had  peek at the books and made a quick exit, be another face in shortly and the mug fans will be asked for a bail out, might even be diddling the tax man again.
If the reports are right & we're getting Giovanni van Bronkhurst a guy that's already proven track record of delivering WOW couldn't be happier WATP
I'm a Celtic fan, and listening to the Rangers fans, they're talking very sensible comments, think Gerrard did well, but he needed cup silverware, interesting who will come in
Can you count 9 in a row for rangers if it was done rorting     the salary cap and the tax man ?
I really cannot understate the peril this naive and very English man is putting himself in.  Kids, don't try this yourselves!  Never approach a Rangers fan you don't know or trust!
Steven Gerrard Will Always Be  A God In Glasgow Bcause He Stopped Them The Manky Mob Winning 9 In A Row Not A Fake 10 One
On the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month stevie geee fucked off from the govan barracks
Gio Next Manager
I honestly think Gerrard left so quickly due to the state or Rangers finances, £105m lost since 2012 and I feel he was told not only would there be no transfer money in January, but that he would have to sell players too. I can see Rangers heading downwards quickly from here.
Thanks For The Memories Steven Gerrard But Family Comes 1st B4 Any Career,
I'm an Aston Villa fan but my Scottish football allegiance is the blue side of Glasgow. I cannot believe some Gers fans are calling Gerrard a traitor and a snake, they have really short memories. We were a hundred miles behind Celtic when Gerrard took over, we weren't competitive, we had a poor squad overall, we were a laughing stock. Gerrard gave us our pride back, we beat Celtic in the league again, we were competitive in Europe getting to the Europa League group stages and getting out of the group twice and of course stopping 10 in a row and getting 55. He signed some real gems for next to nothing and developed them into really good players and he leaves us four points above Celtic top of the league, a league cup Semi Final and still with a shout of once again getting out of our Europa League group. He leaves us in a much better position. Yeah the timing sucks but that's football. Villa are a massive club with their own fantastic history in the best league in the world, this whole which club is bigger debate is pathetic the two clubs are in two totally different leagues therefore two completely different challenges. Do my fellow Gers fans not realise that the founder of Aston Villa was a Scotsman who took the Scottish lion for Villa that Rangers also have? The Claret and Blue colours of Villa were inspired by the maroon of Hearts and the blue of yup Glasgow Rangers! Anyhow Giovanni Van Bronckhurst for me as the next Gers gaffer.
When Steven Gerrard meets Brendan Rodgers at the dugout with the first Villa /Leicester encounter a silent camaraderie without a word mentioned will be shared on oh how quickly Glasgow turned on us both . Though in truth the competion and of course money being more available in the premier league, Yes, for a bigger manager's salary potential but also the money available also when it comes to paying a footballers weekly salary as is it not all financially about just simply buying a player and it ends there  .
He will want the Liverpool job when Klopp leaves, I think it was vital he took a prem job to prove himself at that level to get it
Dick Campbell is about as much as you lot can afford 😂 lmao
Huge step up for Gerrard. Proper football being played now
Football fans are very quick to turn against a manager on a loosing run and demand they be sacked. And yet when a manager chooses to leave, many fans are quick to call them traitors and things like that. It’s hypocrisy.
Maybe, it could take a while: for: rangers, to:  find:  =  A NEW MANAGER, just like: it did for "us" -Celtic??
COVID title ya banger
They a look like drug messes
Thanks for turning us around Stevie
Bring back Murty. The manager the Huns deserve lol ahahahaha
How can you say Callum Davidson has only won two cups, won more in one season than gerrard did in 3
💩
As a Rangers fan I’d like to thank Steven for everything that he has done at Rangers and wish him all the best at Villa. It was never going to last forever but we enjoyed the 3 and a half years we did have. Thanks for stopping Celtic’s ten in a row as well! 😁
Least he'll have a challenge in the prem.... The Scottish premiership is like Englands league one 😂😂😂
Thanks for stopping tattie munches 10. But I think he will leave a sour taste in most fans because of the timing of his departure 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Rangers and celtic are global brands villa ain't!
Callums only won 2 cups 😂😂One more than gerrard 😂😂
Steve Davis as player/manager, as it's probably all Rangers 2012 can afford ???
1st CELTIC have won NINE IN A ROW TWICE , gerrard STOPS NOTHING a reserve covid " title " at the end of CELTICS QUADRUPLE TREBLE WINNERS team is ZERO , ringers TWENTY 12 fans will GRAB every success from anyone ,St JOHNSTONE have won more than gerrard with an EIGHTH of their budget . He is a classless fraudster opportunist,  who took the piss and RAN FIRST CHANCE HE GOT...THERES ONLY ONE GERRARD AND THATS BUTLER 🤣
Villa are a bigger club than Rangers......like it or not the Scottish league is poor and Celtic and Rangers are only big in Scotland. If he has aspirations of managing Liverpool in the future then he’s never go from the Scottish prem to a job like Liverpool. So wether he went to any of the premier league teams that’s a better opportunity to apply his trade in the best league in the world. I imagine social media will be full of death threats and hate towards Stevie G like it was when Brendan Rogers left Celtic...........for Leicester don’t forget. But let’s all remember guys he’s a winner and he has aspirations and he will leave Villa when a bigger club come calling.......that’s how football works. Don’t hate on him and his family man it’s only football at the end of the day.
Giovanni with barry ferguson and kenny miller as asisstants !
I called it a couple days ago as soon as he was on the shortlist he would go and Noone believed it.. Its a crap way to go tbh leaving Rangers in theanner he has however he leaves them in a better place and now he gain the experience of managing in the EPL. Fair play to him just makes the EPL a little better having him back but takes the pulling power of Scottish football away.
Rangers and Villa are both massive clubs tbf. But even as a Villa fan I think it’s a gamble for him. Not complaining though, recon he’ll nail it 💜💙
He will  find out rangers are much bigger than villa in time hope he succeeds because if he doesn't he has no chance of the liverpool  job
Someone loyal FFS!!
As a liverpool fan, I'm disappointed in him leaving rangers hanging. I always assumed he'd stay to defend the title and make rangers a regular of the Europa league knock out stages or champions league group stages. Even if he'd leave before that, I always thought it was going to happen at the end of a season. And especially not a step down to a club like villa who seem to just want to be in the Premier league without any real ambitions. If my opinion even pre-Saudi Newcastle would have been a better option. And if spl winners go directly to ucl group stage, leaving now makes even less sense. I understand that the step up is not in terms of club, but in terms of league. Still villa just seems to be a dead end kind of job.
Lol.
Second  biggest club in Scotland ya silly scouse.No manager and 28 mil in debt Biggest laugh of the week 🤣
Villa is the biggest job he's had, from pub team to a club with history good luck lad
If he truly wants to replace Klopp in future he needs to consistently keep Villa in the top 6...I can't see him doing that.
Your getting Rooney 🤣
The ones on Instagram calling Gerard a rat are not rangers supporters probably from the rats across the city
Stevie legged it coz ange is on the march
We knew he would leave at some point but we thought it would be after his second title and not sneaking off like a thief in the night. Never took him as a badge kisser but after all his sweet words, it is very disappointing that they were spoken dishonestly.
obilgatory not a rangers fan, but when the Prem comes calling you don't say no.
My opinion on a potential great manager would be Clint Hill!!!!!! One day he’ll do an amazing job as a manager somewhere. I am not a Rangers fan, but Clint Hill is an exceptional person.
The top scottisch  welsh and irish teams should  be in the premier league..
Frank Lampatd Boss
That first guy defo has covid
Giovanni van bronchorst💯
Mistake on SG's part. Gone for the money.   Not likely to achieve great things at Villa, too many far richer clubs in the mix.   Legacy is okay in Govan; he got the 55, and stopped the 10; however job left unfinished.   At the end of the day only one trophy in nine domestic attempts. IMO written himself off from ever getting the Liverpool job.
Very disappointed, villa have known fenian links, he should have been told about this, and if he was told and went anyway? Fuck him
Wow! What a shock. To be fair I felt he’d be a failure but it’s nice to be wrong. Even though I favour Celtic he really stepped up the standards of the SPL and most importantly he galvanised Scottish football.
No loyalty in football! Cheers from the bhoys 😁
I hate these bampot rangers fans that are talking bad about a rangers hero. Yeah he could’ve seen us of till the end of the season but the man was going to go to the prem at some point. Have some respect
Jim Goodwin for manager 😁
Congratulations to Steven Gerrard... Allllll the Very Best to You!! YNWA
Aston Villa are a bigger club than Rangers lol
Aston villa are nowhere near as big as rangers
Get McInnes in and stop messing about .
Callums won more trophies than gerrard pal
Apart from the management merry go round at the moment, I think the top four or five Scottish teams should be able to play in the English Premier league, a bit like Welsh clubs are able to play in the football league.
Giovanni vanbronkhorst is the man for the famous got to be
Sam, Steven Gerrard will never be a Rangers legend. He wasn’t with us for long enough and the way he left makes me sure that he never will be mentioned among our legends. I thank him for 55 but talk of legendary managers when we have had men like Bill Struth and Walter Smith makes it laughable. SLIPPING out the way he did was disgusting after stating that he was happy and settled just a week or two earlier.
Rangers are skint , they need to sell players to fund the next manager's investment in the squad. Will also likely mean that the next manager will be someone currently out of work (inability to pay compensation). Interesting times ahead!
Right Bro...LFC ..He's getting ready to move to LFC..deviating abit
The way it goes, only God gets a 10 out of ten,, Hope it works out for Steven Gerrard,,.
I’d love Barry Ferguson to be be new boss
think he's dropped them in shit tbh, should of won cup, league and gone far into europe, then left at end of season tbh
Give pedro a ring
Neil Lennon and Celtic mismanagement stopped 10, Gerrard’s ability was a minor factor at best.
He's went from managing one of two huge sharks in a pond full of minnows to managing a goldfish in a much bigger pond with much bigger sharks. Should have went to a championship club b4 going to the prem. Personally I don't think he's even close to being ready to manage at EPL level. Grateful he stopped them from winning nine and three quarters but the way he left has left a bit of a sour taste.
I'm baffled. He'll be battling to finish top of the bottom half (at best). He had a much better opportunity to build his reputation by securing more trophies and competing in next season's CL. Especially if the end goal is Liverpool he should have continued at a club which demands success.  I'm very surprised he left when/how he has done, as a man of standards/class/honour/dignity.   I could understand if it was someone like Arsenal or Spurs - a restoration project for him to get them back in the top 4. Not mid-table Villa though.
I can't blame people for being upset the manner of his exit leaves a very bad vibe
What are you talking about, he didn't put rangers on the map ,its the other way round rangers put gerard on the manager's map , have some f**ing respect, peace from Algeria
ole on his way to ibrox..............seen in a black merc with darkened windows necking on an iron bru whilst unloading a case of buckfast from the boot, right outside the players entrance. he `s a winner.
Can't really blame the man he's been away from his family for nearly 3 years.Good luck Stevie G.
Of course Villa are bigger the quality players they have cost more than the scottish league combined!
I personally  feel its a great opportunity  for an other Scottish  club to get up there with Celtic and Rangers  both having there issues but unfortunately  the ones who i thought would make a challenge are just not getting  any consistency  may be Hearts  could but for the good of Scottish  football that need to Happen  soon
They don't even speak English up there
Souness back
Apostate of the highest order. If he blows the Villa Job where then. Disgraceful way to treat a club he loved after the passing of Walter Smith.
Rangers are in much deeper shit than they care to remember. The ONLY WAY out of the shit for them is to appoint a Manager who actually cares about the Club.  Rangers have been taken to the cleaners by an entire succession of 'owners' who cleaned them out...then left.  FAN OWNERSHIP of Rangers is the only way now...and the only Manager who 'knows the entire score' at...and about Rangers...is BARRY FERGUSSON. Rangers will probably stagger on for a few years...then fade away unless they employ this formula.  They owe more money than they care to admit and the 'fans ownership/Fergusson' ticket is the only way.  Rangers...also need to get a grip now...and realise they are NOT a big team outside Scotland.  The first 'eejit' you interviewed here said he didn't want Callum Davidson...as he'd only won 'two cups.'  100% more than Gerrard.  Celtic will win the league.
Was inevitable Gerrard was leaving, Rangers won't win the league, club going bust, millions in debt, team pish, no investment, bigotry rife, Abdul as club mascot, Gerrard deserves more especially being a Celtic Fans he can put his Hoops top on with pride 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
He's accepted the move to a bigger club. He will be more successful at Rangers sure but its a challenge he wanted to take.. As a Leicester fan idc about the move other then time to give him stick!
absolutely gutted but it was always going to  happen, I wish him well for all he has done  for us 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 W.A.T.P
Big Ange knocked down his first Rangers' manager. Gerrard has bottled it and done a runner before his name gets tarnished.   I wonder if they will bring Murty back to do some hand stands on the touchline.
They didn't exist to be demoted .The rangers aka sevco was founded in 2012 .£1 coin , More deadly than the atom bomb 👀📢Zombie alert
Skint FC are going to have to do a whip round down the Louden Tavern to get money for a new billboard poster.
I didn’t know rangers are the most successful team in the world , wow ,
Thanks to Stevie G . Came in and done the job that was asked and left behind a quality squad, unfortunetly he missed out on defending the league and taking the team into the champions league. I  hope he does well but it will require the full backing of the club and the reason he took the whole backroom staff as it was never a one man show.  I hope GVB does come in as its the perfect replacement but failing that possibly the hearts manager.  As with anything, Time will tell. Take care and we wish you the best,  WATP.
Wow this guy is a total fanny
It's not the club which attracted him.  It's the league.  Both Rangers and Celtic are more prestigious than Aston Villa.  But what competitive manager worth his salt wouldn't prefer to skipper a middling club in England over a storied club in a tier 2 league?  SG did a wonderful job at Rangers.  But they are in some financial trouble,  having come out of COVID-19 in much rougher shape than Celtic.  The hoops are beginning to string together a good run,  and are only going to get better under Ange after the January xfer window.   If I were a betting man, which I am not,  I would say that Rangers will not repeat.  In fact,  I would wager that they will fade rather dramatically after the winter break.
Villa fans will never love our Queen like us Rangers fans .🇬🇧
Celtic won 9 twice ya TADGER   the sam
When he returns to Anfield on 11th December the Liverpool fans will welcome him back as a club hero as he was always captain of the club I remember MOTD commentator used to say “Gerrard!!!”
Most successful club in the world😂😂😂Come on mate ffs, haven’t ever even made the final of the biggest cup out there.only won the cup winners cup as they gained entry as Celtic won the league and the Scottish cup
Callum Davidson won a cup in his first season of being a manager this boy blows my mind
I would go for lampard but definitely NOT Mccinnes or neil 🇬🇧👍🥃
Personally I don't think he'll do well at villa but the truth is he's fucked the rangers fans over and done the dirty like Rodgers done to Celtic Shame.HAIL HAIL
Do I look happy ? Haw haw haw.
As great as the SPL is I do think to be a great manager there then you need to win something without being at either Celtic or Rangers.   To be a great manager at Celtic and Rangers I do think your talking about managers that achieve something in Europe while managing there. Not necessarily win a European trophy but certainly have a run and take a scalp at least.   Gerrard has done well for Rangers BUT I think Rangers will be ok with the right selection going forward. Massive club that will always do well.
he was always gonna leave. he used rangers to get a better job and his goal has been fulfilled. he will do fck all at villa and fade into obscurity like 90% of all elite ex players.
Villa fan here/CCTV cheat  I would imagine Steven Gerrard being very similar to how Dean Smith was at Villa with the Rangers fans. Brought them back to where they want to be, but gone too soon. Difference being Stevie left you lot. Massive shame. Hope you can all understand his dream
I think the big issue is the old firm being in a league far too small for them. As a Rangers man I’m disappointed to see stevie go just as Celtic fans were disappointed to see Brendan go. The stepping stone is a lot of rubbish as Rangers and Celtic are bigger than the majority of clubs in the EPL, wasn’t too long ago pep was asking fans to turn up to the stadium and that’s Man City. Yes obviously the EPL is a far better league but it’s becoming a tourist league now, I think it needs the old firm to join now to bring back some flair to the league from a fans perspective as most EPL games are like libraries except the odd club. I can guarantee if Rangers and Celtic moved to the EPL in 10 years time they will be competing in the top 4, so now more than ever both clubs need to leave the SPL.
Gerrard won a league title in his time at Rangers and made them significantly stronger again, but he's not a legendary Rangers figure surely, come on, that's hype. Celtic had won 4 trebles in a row, 12 trophies, and couldn't keep winning indefinitely.  It will be interesting to see Mr Gerrard take the helm at Villa though.
Steven Gerrard is gone.  Whats that noise  ? BANG ! Oh,  it's the club formerly known as Rangers bubble bursting.  Sevco are skint and Gerrard got out before the shit hits the fan again, and he will be glad to leave the cesspool of sectarianism and racism which is ibrox. GLASGOW'S green and white.
Mick McCarthy for the job I reckon
Callum Davidson won 2 cups in a third of the time it took gerrard to win 1 trophy 🏆🏆
You found very polite Rangers fans. Or Rangers fans are just very polite people :)
I'm a hearts fan but Rangers are huge in comparison to Villa. Does Gerrard go to Villa if both teams are prem teams ? Not a fucking chance.
GVB if he takes the job could be a good thing the team won the league over the worst Celtic team in history the team is playing garbage. Its obvious AV tapped him up rangers stated the morning no club had been in touch yet according to reports he agreed terms at dinner last night. Personally I wouldn't mind the Dutch connection again look at Ajax GVB 6/5 fav.
Dont half talk some shit about Rangers..in Scotland it is either Rangers or Celtic,my granny could win a title if she managed one of the two.So do not be going on as if it was something remarkable that Gerrard did at Rangers.
Ole's on his way there now
How ANY of you so called Rangers fans can call Steven Gerrard a RAT or a SNAKE is fucking ridiculous!! This absolute legend of a man came to Ibrox and completely changed things for the better!!  Remember the Graeme Murty era ffs🤦🏻‍♂️🙈 and where you were in relation to Celtic when Gerrard took over. He's the man who stopped Celtic getting 10 in a row and won the league at a canter while doing it!! He's taken you into Europe....... actually IN the competition, not the qualifiers, and WON games, home and away.  So as he leaves, he leaves behind him.............. Celtic!! Your still in with a chance to progress further in Europe this season. Top of the league by 4 points and in a cup semi final. I'd say that he's worked fucking miracles and left Rangers in a brilliant position and one that looked impossible the week before he took charge and Murty was still in the hot seat. Show some RESPECT!!!!  Stevie G = LEGEND 💯
Rangers getting skelped with big clatty bag of reality.
Get Derek McInnes in or Russell Martin they will do a great job 😅 sevco zombies every tim is laughing at you after you did the same to us with Rodgers
What had  stevie g proved before he joined an under 18s coach at LIverpool  took him his third attempt to win the league it took Callum Davidson one season to win two cup that first guy was either drunk or on drugs or both he was talking blethers
Rangers just going to back to being that team in blue that Celtic play .  All the Gerrard fans gave our glorious club many eyes upon it ,now  Stevie is gone , we are going to be laughed at again for being a banter club 😭 Gattuso for 56
He broke Celtc forever.  Gerrard will always be a God in Glasgow.
If he's not a rat, then he's a snake.  I thought he was a legend, even before he came to us. I thought that if anyone knew anything about loyalty, it was him. He did do well for Rangers, I won't dispute that. As a person though, got zero respect for him. It's a real shame, because he could have been remembered for the right reasons. He's well and truly fucked that imo.
Gerrard didn't leave for a bigger club, he left for a better league.
“Everyone has to prove themselves before they come to Rangers” aye cos Gerrard did eh
I would vote for Gattuso for the next manager, but some dud will likely get it.
I can't believe that he has left at this time and not waited till the end of the season. However i wish him well. Now to give our support to the next manager.
Gio Neil mccann Barry ferguson Com on u bears 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧 Thanx SG🔴⚪️🔵55
Get in Harry redknapp, chris houghton or Big sam Al ... can all work with the budget and are experienced managers also raise the profile a little of the SPL and great man management.
at 3.52 you should blur out tavs lambo license plate
I hope Frank Lampard will take over Rangers but I can see him taking over Norwich City but either of them clubs I would be happy for him being a Chelsea supporter and it wouldn't be nice to see Frank Lampard in the dug out in Norwich as I am in Norfolk and got a couple of tickets to go and see them play football
he's a Legend to me for winning that Title - for me probs 1 if not the most important 1 in Scottish football history
Huge loss for Rangers. But Villa is a great club to manage.   Still belive Rangers will win the league
Villa are lucky if they finish 6th 🤣 unlikely to ever see europa never mind the champions league 🤣😂
Forget all this talk of legends, icons, smash hitters, and swashbucklers. The first thing that should happen down Govan way is the face painter should demand payment upfront this time, just in case.
Gio for me
Lampard would be a good addition he did well at Derby before Chelsea came calling
1 trophy in 9 is great job eh
That ginger guys clueless of his clubs history, 1 and counting 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The first guy is so level headed , top lad
Hey best of luck to Stevie and the backroom staff, thanks for so many great memories, always be a Rangers legend stopped the mankies and has put them in their place , good luck at Villa, sorry you decided to go mid season
Callum Davison... 2 cups..  More than Gerrard ya fanny 😂 and has been with saints less time than Gerrard was at rangers.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣pause for breath 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Biggest club in Europe 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
He used rangers as a stepping stone to get into the Premier league, so did Brendon Rodgers
That tells you all you need to know about Scottish football it is a "mickey-mouse" league and there only two teams of any consequence; both should make application to join the English Premiership at the first opportunity.  They both blew it in 2004 (I think) when they could have joined the new English Championship, but arrogance prevailed and assumed they were too good; and only the Premiership would do!  What a waste!
The guy on about Callum Davison only won 2 cups …. Gerrard has 1 trophy … also mentions unproven well who did Gerrard manage before the rangers job also mentions he got them 55 that’s what he was brought into do? So we gonna just totally erase the previous 2 seasons then
First guy means he won then their 1st title. No such thing as 55. Gerrard won a single trophy out of 9. He's gash.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Get it right up yah you horrible people! Your world has fallen apart, thats Karma right there HH Mon The Hoops!
2 weeks after rangers lost walter thought more of gerrard
Why is he a rat? he won Rangers there first league title in 10 Years he deserves a lot more respect than that
At the end of the day it’s a job and anyone offered 2,3,4 times there current salary would jump at the chance myself included , I’m gutted he’s away but wish him all the best and only real gers fans won’t slate him WATP
He wont get in the top six at Villa
Not too long ago NewCo fans were taking the piss out of Celtic after Rodgers left them in the lurch half way through a season....well..... Hopefully NewCo will use the compensation from Aston Villa to pay off their debt but I doubt it. Aston Villa are getting a manager who won one out of nine possible silverware in a league with only two serious competitors....and that win was only because Celtic players downed tools.
😂😂😂😂😂😂🇮🇪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 won the Covid cup and fucked off 😂😂😂😂
What a joke 🤣 Vila and not rangers aye aye Steven Rodgers enjoy Yer championship run 💸💸💸💸💸
The problem now isn't just the fact Stevie g has left the problem is he's taking majority if not all the back room staff with him and probably raid Gers in January for atleast 2 or 3 players, is this the demise I hope not but it's a huge ask for whoever's next to just continue what Stevie has moulded , it's a tough 1 to take with it being during a season but it is what it is .
Rangers fans were chatting shit when some celtic fans called brendan a snake instead of wishing him farewell, now those same fans are doing the same thing for Gerrard lmao
the stepping stone comment is hard one, Rangers defo bigger than Villa. Im a Liverpool fan and would say he needs to prove himself in the prem, before Liverpool even consider him, there is no guarantee he this becomes a stepping stone unless he shows he good enough, I understand Rangers fans mixed feeling and I feel like Villa have a squad that can challenge for top 7 (europa conference) I do think Gerrard wouldn't have left Rangers for a club that only gonna fight for staying up and i don't see i better job going in the next year of 2 so he has to take the gamble at a bad time, it would be a missed opportunity if he didn't go. Its a small step back for the chance at a big step forward. We saw with Lamps and Ole that legends don't always work and I think Gerrard knows this and that's why a move to a top 10 minumin prem side is needed for him to test himself as a coach
He left us to early,but villa wasn't going to wait until the end of the season,they needed him now.all the best to him and we should never forget what he done for the club,No Surrender 🇬🇧 WATP
Popcorn troops....🍀 😎 🍿
Postecouglou
As a Villa fan, some very honourable comments from most of the Rangers fans, fair play!, I’m sure Gers will be ok in time. Yes it’s a big gamble for him, the expectation at VP is massive.
nab scott parker off of bournemouth, hes doing wonders for that team
Its not that he left we knew he would at some point its the manner in which he left thats the issue he was sneaky and cowardly
Beautifully put by one of they idiots at work today “f..k was never accepted at Rangers he was nothing but a f….n bastard” the mind of a Rangers “fan” 😂😂😂
Rangers are a far bigger club than Villa coz if u take the epl sponsorship and tv revenue Villa are fk all smaller support the lot n am a Hibs n Liverpool fan
Celtic are still the best team in Scottish football history
Gutted he left, but he done amazing in stopping the 10 in a row, his family has to come first so good luck Steve and thank you
Running from a sinking ship.
Lampard would be a good shout he is - more one of them than Gerrard anyway. 🇬🇧All the best to Gerrard. Villa is a gamble,  but a great opportunity. People need to bear in mind too  that his family are in England, and maybe he just wanted to stay a few seasons at Rangers in the hope that the success there would bring about a English Premier op, which it has. He’s an ambitious guy - he owes Rangers nothing. Like anyone , if you want a new job and a better one comes up - you go for it.
He bottled it septic are up our ass plus he bought some shite players never been a fan of him
Rangers were dissolved, a new club called The Rangers were formed, a totally separate entity from the original club legally.
Plz bring in Giovanni van bronckhorst as the manager
Grateful for what he gave but he’s a snake and has tarnished his reputation and cant be trusted on what he says
Why aren’t villa a better team than rangers?
Rangers a bigger club than villa for me. However Villa play in the Prem. If Rangers were in the prem no way would Gerrard have left.
I get the frustration of Rangers Fans, Aston Villa being bigger is debatable but the job is definitely bigger and harder considering the position in the League Table and also more money. Wish the best for Rangers, AVFC and Gerrard.
No ones bigger than this football club....eh Aston villa maybe hahahahhaa big durty murty will be rolling about on his cranium in a few days, gerrard seen what's round the corner and the rat left the ship 😉 smart lad 😉
What about Ole at the wheel? 👀
Feels similar to Brendon Rodgers when he left Celtic for Leicester city . but all the best to Gerrard in his new role at avfc
Great work getting the video out today. I agree and disagree with a couple of your points on here.  I agree that Villa is a difficult job, what seems as success for them? Europe or a trophy? Don’t think they’ll achieve that.   I disagree with the stepping stone, I think Stevie thinks he needs to prove himself before he gets the LFC job in the prem and that’s why he has taken the job. (Not just that but it’s a big factor as well as money)
I personally think this is a great video mate 😁
Leaving mid season is extreme disrespect to any club I personally believe he should have gained experience in the championship before taking on the EPL I don't see it working out professionally but I see it as the best decision for his family and career progression so let's hope he does do a good job
That 1st dude looks pissed lol
All about money no loyalty shown unlike the loyalty the fans have shown him😭
Demotion through the divisions 🤣🤣🤣
I’ve subscribed because you were interviewing my da with the red jacket
Don’t know why rangers fans are having a hot at stevie g for leaving he stopped 9 in a half in a row what they moaning for ?
Hello Sam, because st Johnstone won two trophies last season. Could you go see them and see the two cups?:) Callum Davidson won the two trophies last season
1 trophy out of 9 in 3 and half years only won due to the Covid chaos . Oh but he stopped 10 ! Wim Jansen Stopped 10 and won the double in 9 months for Celtic. Enough said ! Bye Slippy G you are and will continue to be a flop 👋
Thank fuck he's left
As a Celtic fan I think he’s made a mistake going to villa he could have waited till the end of the season but that’s only my opinion.
Can't really blame him, been away from his family for nearly the whole time he's been up here, and Angeballs scared the life out him. Bottled it at the first sight of a challenge. If he was really in to Ranjurs he would have would moved his family up.
that last bloke you talked to really made me laugh with his sign off.
He’s staying at Villa until Klopp leaves Liverpool then he’ll take over Liverpool in his place.
Wat do expect rangers he deserve a bigger club  but dnt forget he is a legend for ur club
Rephrase please…one of the biggest clubs? We are the biggest club🇬🇧 Also….it’s the back room staff that carried Gerrard, so a big name manager is great, but it’s who comes with him is just as important.
Yeah, take Frank Lampard........Fat Frank will definitely take you in the right direction........and that is downwards.........ex Chelscum player who turned his back and put 2 fingers up to West Ham........he is such an honourable guy...not!  as a Fulham bloke hope he gets the job!!!! COYW's Fulham the oldest London League club....we hate Chelsea!!!!!!
I’m a Villa fan, I think everyone wraps up on who is bigger Villa or Rangers, they are both Massive clubs. It’s the League! The Premiership is the reason. Total respect to the SPL, but the Premiership is undoubtedly much Bigger. Money, players, Managers, Size and TV rights there’s Simply no comparison. Rangers are an amazing team, but sadly it’s just simply the Extra factors! Anyway, Up the Villa, Good luck Rangers!
English txxxxr feck off ...rangers much bigger
There is little or no difference from Glasgow and Birmingham when being closer to your family in Liverpool. This is not a reason.
We're having a party the second time ragers die whos coming?
Any club in the premiership our championship is a bigger pull than playing for rangers. 🤫🤫🤫
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂☘️
He's not a club legend, far from it. I appreciate everything he's done for the club, but club legend?  not for me. Bill and Walter are true club legends.
There are 3 trophies to achieve in the Scottish prem per year which Gerrard has been there for 3 years so out of 9 trophies to play for Gerrard won Rangers 1 trophy out of 9 is abysmal states no matter how much Gerrard admirers twist it!! Laughable how they are trying to polish a turd
1:48 Gerrard wasn’t the first manager to get a win over Celtic after administration it was mark warburton
This is a good fit between Gerrard and Villa
🐍
🐍
No brainer to leave a mickey mouse league to go to a bigger club in a bigger league
Aye stevie is loyal to rangers aye nae bother....laughed at us when brendan left ....what goes around comes around😆😆😆😆😆
A lot of fans expected that Gerrard would leave at the end of the season so the timing of his departure coming a couple of weeks after he answered a question from a reporter about rumours of him possibly leaving with the response "Do I look unsettled" and when she said no he said "then don't ask silly questions".  People are speculating that Villa were sounding out Gerrard's representatives before they sacked Dean Smith about whether he would come to Villa
Agent murty on standby
So sad to listen to those football addicts...... get a life, find another sport..... please !!
davids fucking raging man ahahahah
He stopped celtic getting 10 in a row so i hope he does well at his new club so no bad feeling towards our old gaffer
The title race is now even money. Ironic that Celtic will probably go into Jan window more settled.
if you don't understand the stepping stone talk you need to get out of the football sector because its clear you don't know what your talking about.
He is a slipperly Customer.
I'm a Rangers fan, I think he's left at a terrible time but it's not his fault when the Villa job has become available. He's brought us up from being a poor team and stopped 10 in a row, he cane off the back of us getting beaten 5-0 from Celtic which took some bottle. Fans who are hating him discusts me, his family are in England, he wants to manage Liverpool and he'll be getting way more money why wouldn't he leave? Reminds me of how Neil Lennon was treated when he left Celtic. Fans being fickle as always.
OMG...... another football manager's wife asking to leave  Glasgow !!
Not a rangers fan but I just hate celtic for some reason always have lol but Gerrard  did awesome work for rangers and it was always going to happen.  Just hope  they get a good replacement  for you
He’s never going to go Liverpool yh right mate we all get him 🥰🤣🤣🤣
The first guy: “ Callum Davidsons only won 2 cups” Gerrard has won 1 trophy in double the amount of time Davidsons been in his job🤣🤣🤣
'Callum Davidson what's he won 2 cups' 😂😂😂 1 more than Stevie G ya rocket
Got respect Gerrard going bigger club in villa I'm a rangers fan
be intresting to see him in the prem great vid btw also id love to see a wrexham vlog an asking fans about deadpool as the owner (ryan reynolds ik)
I mean he wants the Liverpool job let him have it he’ll be crawling back to rangers after being relegated to the championship
It is a potential stepping stone to Liverpool, that is not however a slight on Rangers or even saying that Aston Villa is a bigger club, rather it is simply to do with the fact that the EPL is a bigger league than the SPL.  The stress and pressure of managing in the EPL is at another level as well.  Klopp has given indications that he may leave LFC when his contract finishes and Gerrard may have realised, or been advised, that he needs to demonstrate that he has EPL experience and that he can build a strong team in the EPL pressure cooker environment before LFC will consider him for the job.  LFC is managed as a business by a large American corporation with a view to make money first and foremost.  That organisation will not appoint Steven Gerrard based purely on emotion or his legacy as a player.  They need to protect the brand and they need to protect Gerrard's commercial value to Liverpool (he is a future ambassador like King Kenny and Ian Rush and that value to LFC is reduced if he fails at Anfield and is sacked).  Aston Villa have significant financial resources behind them and I would imagine that most players would take a phone call from Steven Gerrard to discuss playing under the former LFC and England Captain so the combination of money and Gerrard's status should give them the capacity to recruit good to great players.  The test will be whether he can mould a squad with a winning mentality from a team that is nearer the bottom than the top at present.
Get on the phone Frank Lampard
Best of Luck Stevie Gerrard, I think Villa are a step back, but you have taken the decision to face another big challenge, similar to your arrival at Ibrox.  Wishing you all the best, and thanks for the memories.  WATP !
Well steven we would love you here at villa!    yeahhhh courrrrsssssseeeee!
Truthfully I don't think that Stevie G will do the Biz down South, but as a Rangers fan I thank him for his efforts and for stopping 10 in a row 😎🇬🇧
👀🤣
Barry fergusson
Thanks SG for bringing 55 you'll always have a special place in our fabulous supporters hearts good luck in your new chapter special thanks to your backroom staff and I wish you and your family all the very best legend.watp.
yeeaaa courseeee hehe btw lampard would be a good appointment
Rangers look a bit stale this season. So could be a good thing. Van Brockhurst or Mcinnes to take over for 56
Leaving halfway through the season of a side poised to win the league is a stupid decision. Traitor to them Villa is a very dodgy job.  Massive risk and poisoned his relationship with the gers fans. I'd of seen out this season. First fan you interviewed was brilliant 👏  proper football fan.
people saying it's a gamble but any new manager at a club, no matter how much success they've had elsewhere, is a gamble, theres always a risk & even experienced managers have flopped in some clubs they've gone to
He told Rangers players he was going to birthday celebrations in London and also didn't let fans know?(scared of the backlash?)he did do a lot for the club but I can't forgive the man for the way he left (my opinion)
used that FOOTY code.... be interested to see what mystery shirt I received......
As an English football fan and neutral regarding scottish football i think that Gerrard has shown no respect towards Rangers FC. I cant see him winning anything with Villa and to walk away from guaranteed european football and trophies each year is downright disgusting on his behalf. I honestly believe he left for the money that Villa must have been offering ⚽️
It's not as if he's left Rangers in the shit , he did a remarkable job while he was there , and his first managerial job too , and the season that they had in the league last season was unbelievable .   Personally , I think he should of stayed for the rest of the season but I bet he's seen this as a perfect opportunity , plus he won't be too far away from Merseyside in terms of family .  Good luck to him .
Gerard is still an unknown quantity.  One trophy out of nine. £50m in transfers Club losing money hand over fist. Callum Davidson won 2 trophies last season with £50
Steve Bruce free agent
Slip sliding away !
Well said the first bloke , 100% agree nail on the head 🇬🇧👍
He won rangers newco their first title, it'll take them 54 more title wins to get to 55 bloody idiots
Frank Lampard and Slavin Billic are favourites atm
Too be honest as a Celtic fan, is it a good move for Gerrard only time will tell that, do I agree with it, no too be honest I don't as I believe rangers are massive club as well as Celtic and why would you throw the chance of managing in UCL away. Only Gerrard knows that answer, having said I do wish him well for the future.   Too be honest I think Ally mcciost should be given the chance to manage the club again
Was always going at some point.
we should never forget Steven Gerrard ~ the guy was a legend for the Glasgow Rangers. sad he's gone but time to move on now! GVB!
The only way Villa are a 'stepping stone' is due to them playing in the Premiership. Villa are a big club, but they're never going to be challenging for the title, they may pick up an occasional cup here and there. I think if Gerrard can make them a top 10, top 6 club, that will be successful and could then attract the attentions of your bigger clubs, possibly even European clubs. He'll certainly have a far larger transfer budget than he's had at Rangers, so there's a greater potential to bring in a better quality player. I'm a Dons fan, but i can appreciate the job he's done at Rangers. When he came in, they were effectively a shambles. He built his own team and won the title last season at a canter. You have to feel there may have been a chance of Rangers pipping Celtic the previous season, had it not been cancelled due to Covid. Yes, Celtic were 13 points ahead, but Rangers still had to play them twice. Win those and you're looking at 7 points. It wasn't beyond the realms of possibility. I think he done a brilliant job at Ibrox, he put them back on the European map with some brilliant results and good runs in the Europa League. What's important from a Rangers view point now, is that they appoint the correct man, who can pick up where Gerrard has left off and keep up the momentum. Talk of McInnes i think is purely journalistic tripe. McInnes bottled it out of a move there a few years ago. No one has looked at him since his sacking from us in March, why would Rangers even consider it? They have to get a big name in, someone with experience. It will certainly be interesting to see who emerges as the top man.
Great work as always Sam 💪💪
Thanks for heading down to Ibrox Sam 👍🏻 Stevie G will go with the majority of fans best wishes - it's just the timing of him leaving that's irked us all. But he's not bigger than Rangers and we'll hopefully get the right person in to see us through to retaining our title. My bet is Gio VB
I think Frank lampard good choice big personality, rangers are a massive club some much tradition.😎
All these rangers fan's saying he this that n the next need to take a good look at themselves steven gerrard came in turn the club around done what he was required to do and that was stop ten in a row no matter what he was always going to go at some point he following his dreams off becoming the Liverpool manager which will happen one day and this will give him a proper taste for it he will go down as a legend for stopping ten in row can't take away the credit he deserves for it and anyone who says he don't get a life because am sure you take a step up the ladder to your dream job or better paid position in your own job he does not need the money he got money as footballer  he doing it to get more managerial skills under his belt for the Liverpool job in a few years time best off luck steven gerrard
Brendan won a double treble and was on course for a treble treble and he is hated by the Celtic fanbase. Stevie's won one trophy and left midway through a season. He definitely wont be remembered as a legend.
This was inevitable.  I actually can't believe he'd stayed at Rangers as long as he had.
Now he is going to get all out of the PL🙄
SOTV
It’s hard to hate a man who broke that dominance but I can understand some ranger fans saying he’s a snake but you can understand why Stevie jumped for the job it won’t available forever
Its the lies that pisses me off
Good video again  🚜🚜🚜👍👍👍
Steve Clarke might be a good fit for Rangers but would he want to walk away from possibly taking Scotland to the World Cup?
Callum Davidson, outsider but he has won more trophies in one season that SG won in 3…
Makes me happy to see the bigots loose their manager
Can see Gerrard getting a few players from rangers thats definitely gunna happen
Alex Neil best, then Van B....Lampard not a good fit...Chelsea were a shambles under L...
ive no love for rangers at all but when i was in deepest darkest australia i could find a rangers supports club, never saw a villa one, rangers are far bigger than villa  However this move, strange though it is, is a bit of a leveller, rangers are now experiencing turbulence, celtic arent firing on all cyclinders, this could open up that league
This move poses and interesting question: should transfer windows rules apply to manager transfers the same way they’re applied to players??  The rule was supposed to protect clubs with less resources being poached by those with larger spending power and prevent them being plunged into turmoil mid-season. But I suppose if mangers weren’t allowed to leave then underperforming managers couldn’t be relieved of their duties…I dunno 🤷🏻‍♂️   Unless Rangers get an out-of-work manager to replace him, switches like this start a merry go round of clubs losing and replacing managers. That can’t be good for the stability of the game?
What do you think which footballing system is better-Scottish or English?
Can skip the first four minutes...deary me...
He'll double or triple his and his staff's wages going to villa. He must think he can make a difference otherwise why would you, unless something with him and the board has happened behind the scenes. Promises not kept etc. I hope he does well. No hard feelings from me. That's fooball and sport when money is involved. I hope we get someone in next who fits our style of play. Gio would be my shout. He played a similar 433 with Feyenoord.
New manager with new ideas cud give celtic the advantage now
The guy has been away from his family for most of the week for over 3 years. Birmingham is a hell’uva closer than Glasgow. I cannot blame him one bit and wish him all the best. That’s not to say I’m not disappointed. I wish he’d have stayed at least until the end of the season, but it’s not to be.  He leaves Rangers in a better place than he found us, and he helped raise the profile of the Scottish game. Hoping GVB takes up the reins now and takes us to 56!!
I walked past you at the Kelty Hearts  game.
Verrrrrry interesting appointment for Aston Villa, and Stevie Gerrard himself. It seems like it was a respectful separation between Gerrard and Rangers. As a neutral, I'm really looking forward to see how this appointment ends up. ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
It’s not a step up it’s a step down in my opinion the only difference is he will get paid a lot more money at villa
Rangers was always going to be a stepping stone.
It’s an offer Gerrard couldn’t turn down in my opinion and he’s left rangers in a good place
30 pieces of silver says it all We simply meant nothing and he used us Personally I hope he falls flat on his face and Villa will get relegated
Who will take over????
haha
