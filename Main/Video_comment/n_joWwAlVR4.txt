Extended highlights will be published as soon as broadcast restrictions expire!
Sometimes he’s Alcarpediem and sometimes Alcarajo
After Nadal, he gets Alcaraz to get revenge for Nadal lol
Coming here after 2024 Wimbledon 🎉Alcaraz ☝️🏆
¡Anda ya, negraco!
Well done Carlos 👏🎾❤️
Alcaraz’s recovery is incredible!
the best sporting event of the year alongside world cup no question
I was there. Super fun match.
I was at that match. Great times
It doesn’t feel bad when you loose to the person who won the entire tournament you played in , right YouTube fam ?
The way he fought and his physical dominance... made it so shocking to hear "he becomes the second teenager to ever play US Open finals". Definitely he's not what typically comes to your mind when you think of a teenager
hey Tiafoe... go and eat some 🍌🍌
this match was way better than the final
Tennis ball was bounced on moon by astronaut before it bounces twice it was returned on earth by Alcaraz..
head high. ALCARAZ is just not human!!! Insane shots!
Serena the king and queen of Tennis PERIOD!!!
Tiafoe vs alcaraz is going to be a long time rivalry! Once tiafoe reaches those top rankings, the regular contests for titles between these two is gunna be insane!

This match kind of felt like the real final tbh
Alcaraz está enfermo, future☝🏼🏆
He has that same dead behind the eyes look as Nadal. Must be something in it
Nuy bueno el partido
End of the day Tiafoe is a underperformer,  barely even a one hit wonder. At least Roddick won ONE Grandslam. More excited to see Krygios vs Alcaraz.
Bn JOUEUR
This kid’s  going place🔥
Future legend Alcaraz against the best version of Tiafoe ever seen. What a match!
1:26 was the most insane shot ever. Hitting a shot that cuts so hard while running forward is exactly why his opponent never expected it
Para quien esté leyendo esto, eres amado. Eres bendecido. Tus sueños se están manifestando mientras hablamos. El tiempo está de tu lado. Todo saldrá a tu favor. Que encuentres más amor, paz y prosperidad. Sigue brillando tu luz en este mundo. Te necesitamos ....
Меня раздражает публика дикари.Когда они орут как резаная свинья.А каково теннисистам?
There’s just no way this guy doesn’t win the US Open
Tiafoe has to learn how to stay focus, he tries to be a too much of showman, which is not bad but you gotta win IT. Beats the GOAT and He doesn’t followed it up with the title missed opportunity. Winning battles are great but winning the war is much better.
The Serb i.e. Joker i.e. Djokovic, Novak pushed this bar. He's supposed to have had the opportunity. Ugh, controversy sorting throughout sports🃏
Tennis is not black or white game in USA infact  it is everyone gentle man game.
Awesome match
Two gentlemen players. Graceful even in defeat. No antics, no broken racquets. It could've gone either way. Thrilling till the end.
Seriously, what’s better final than two players fighting for their first grand slam title and No.1 ranking!! This is incredible!!
What a match. At 0.13 of the highlights is the BEST point I have EVER seen in tennis. Both players gave everything wow 😮👏🏾
the sheer look of utter confidence is clearly shown by the expression on his face 0:29
Next generations
Ambos, Tiafoe y Alcaraz, qué buen partido.
How do you highlight 4 hours of spectacular tennis in just 3 minutes? Hopefully there'll be extended highlights that do this match justice.
優勝しそう
Stop showing winner in thumbnail!
Blocking Djokovic from playing gs and hyping this lil kid like crazy. I smell sus!
Camino a hacer la  leyenda dell  tenis..

Tiafoe’s celebration at 2:02- Was he imitating Alcaraz lol
Spectacular points. Two awesome players, how delightful is to watch this
Dang, Tiafoe had to go up against two Spaniards both 2 and 3rd seeds. He is truly admirable in this tournament.
These two are part of the future of tennis post-Big 3. Such a shame that one of them had to lose, but it was more of Alcaraz winning than Tiafoe losing.
So happy with the final - Ruud and Alcaraz such class acts [Tiafoe included] there is hope for ATP going forward. The idea of future men's tennis belonging to Karen Jokeabitch and Karen Crygiosomemore was enough to block any interest.
VIVA ESPANA GRANDE !
Que Pedazos de Cracks!
BRAVO!!!!
Tiafoe only won sets in tiebreakers because of his serve. Fortunately in tennis, there is more to the game than tiebreakers. Alcaraz and Sinner, for that matter, are vastly superior players compared to Tiafoe, and it makes plenty of sense that the Alcaraz vs. Sinner winner plays Ruud for the title.
🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
I will never get over the look Tiafoe gave the crowd😭
コートカバーリングが歴史上最高なんよ。
One of these guys is a complete clown.
Carlos is bringing back the era of attacking tennis after boring grinding game of nole. But scary part is this guy can defend like Nadal and nole. Scary stuff for other players
This boy gets crazy views. Already the hype is out of world and he has backed it up. A superstar without pr of likes of zverev who despite atp push never excited the audience like alcaraz🤑
The hug at the end🥹
what a battle holy molly, Carlos keep fighting would like to see you with 20+ gram slam, , Vamos ...
After a hiatus of 44 years, I'm back to watching tennis. Wow.  The new young fellows are amazing !
No me gusta la jente prepotente y a este chico lo veo asi lo siento pero es lo que pienso
Both of them are so show off. You won't see in big three.
Que juegazo al chil€  Saludos desde mexico
Magic match!
The game point for 6-6 in first set is unbelievable.
It's frightening how he chases down every impossible ball. Talk about lost causes? There are none with Alcaraz!
😁😁👍🇪🇸
I said it from the break- last night was the Final. So much tension and drama. Watched it from beginning to end man. As a Nadal fan, i was worried the state of the men's gm aftr Nadal, Djokovic & Federer step away. But Tiafoe & Carlos anwered that question resoundingly last night. Hats to both of them! They both were winners in my book! Now lets see if Alcaraz is ready 4 the finish line as a champ AND NEW WORLD #1!!!!!
This clip aint do this match no justice man! Best match of the year hands down by far. Both guys wanted it. Both knew *HISTORY* was on the line here.
C.alcaraz make energy efecient in game, but F.tiafoe need energy more than strategy in game, congratz to next begining final grand slam C.alcaraz, F.tiafoe make calm every game to next level
I've seen the improvements Frances Tiafoe has made over the last couple of years. I watched as James Blake tearfully shared what Tiafoe meant to him, to tennis, and to black and brown people. Frances Tiafoe is the best of America. Unfortunately, despite his improvements, Tiafoe still has weaknesses such as his inconsistent first serve, weak second serve, and lack of backhand topspin. Also, he often lobbed the volley back rather than volley to win the point. It's my feeling too that his conditioning still isn't where it needs to be. As the match progressed Tiafoe's joints tightened. The power on his forehand diminished. Tiafoe's gait is odd, short and stiff, similar to Andy Murray's. Perhaps if Tiafoe stretched several hours a day, like Novak Djokovic, it would help him immensely. I believe Carlos Alcaraz is next in line to win multiple majors. Throw Medvedev into the mix and Tiafoe has an uphill battle. Tiafoe has heart and charisma like no other player. I too hope that Frances Tiafoe will win the U.S. Open.
Alcaraz is second Djokovic.
I see Ruud W 5 set
Francis is a great player who doesn't attack very well,  glumsy & inconsistent. He can't make a great player if he continues playing like this.Bro , you need improvement...
Frances serve was only 20% in 5th.
In 50 years of playing and teaching and watching tennis this would rate as top 5 matches. The strokes were magnificent beyond belief.  The endurance was other worldly. The suspense amazing. These 2 guys will be at the top for many many years. Their demeanor is great.
Alcaraz reminds me of Alcatraz
I always hate when a match is lost by an error & not a winner
0:13 Serena, have you ever done that?
09.10.2022 the day Alcaraz transformed from boy to man.
VIVA EL PALMAR, VIVA MURCIA, VIVA CARLITOS Y VIVA ESPAÑAAAAA🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
Bigfoe woke up and choose violence 😈 1xtime Delray Beach Champion 😤 0xAtp 500 🥵 0xAtp Masters 😴 0xGrand Slams 😩
This is for all of those who were saying that US open without Djokovic not worth to watch.
La famine est sur le point d'arrivée en Europe et partout dans le monde et ils complet bientôt cette paroles (il y aura de grands tremblements de terre, et, en divers lieux, des pestes et des famines; il y aura des phénomènes terribles, et de grands signes dans le ciel.

a quoi il tourne Alcaraz ? 3 matches en 5 sets et toujours pas un pet de sueur?
Without Djokovic it's too much easy
Can you imagine if Naomi Osaka had to play 3 late night 5 setters in a row?
ce mec(alcaRAZ) est incroyable !  j'ai juste peur que la finale contre ruud soit un copier/coller de la finale de RG--> BORING😟
Congratulations alcaraz for your Victor to tiafo thanks
I'm the only one who misses Djokovic?
It's silly without Novak the greatest
For me alcaraz is futur number one for tennis see you
If I were ever to attend a tennis match, I will definitely consider to get one where Taifoe is in. Twice, I decide to watch tennis & then do something else. Nadal vs Tiafoe then Alvarez bs Tiafoe….. nope nothing else got done.   Thanks- what tennis is! 😄
Алькараз офигенный
- How many fivesetters can you play in a row? Alcaraz:  - Yes.
Never thought I’d ever see another nadal but he’s here.
tiafoe is a incredible human being and sportsman he never quit and didnt get upset he was playing a robot
Carlos remind me mix betwen rafa djoko and federer with the power delporto right handicapés Wow
VAMOOOOOOS CARLITOOOS 💪🏼🎾🇪🇸❤️
See the big 3 were not missed
What a match this was! Watched extended highlights elsewhere and the energy and shot making from both was phenomenal! Love the energy that Tiafoe brings in any of his matches and Alcaraz is always high on energy, so this was a great match up!
Esta final es para vosotros alcaraz..
Epicus Game.
The Hug after the Match, what a respect 👍🏻
Mr. McPato, a hacer monigotadas a otra parte!
Tiafoe is an average player / run of the mill. He will never win a Grand Slam. He will never be better than Medvedev, Zverev, Tsistispas, Alcaraz, Nole, Rafa, Sinner, Berretini, Felix Auger-Alissime.  There are no chances for him in AO, Paris, Wimbledon....
A most interesting match - some lows with bad shots at key moments and yet at it's highs some of the most electrifying points I've seen in my life.
ALCARAZ, THE FASTEST PLAYER IN HARD SURFACE!!!
dream match in final! what a battle will take place!
Alcaraz Is amazing but is lucky djokovic isn’t in the draw
Finally, Nadal has got a successor. Spain is an authentic cradle of champions.
wow... tougher to sink than expected....
Carlos was born for this. He is a natural, and to meet Ferrero was the cherry on the cake. Now, the big question, will be a more fresh Ruud able to cancel Alcaraz game? Fatigue and tiredness in the final will be a big factor.
What a fantastic match! But whoever made this replay was not on their game.
Really a joy to see the young guys giving it their all. Sunday is winner takes all.
Alcaraz said forget about the future of tennis, I wanna win NOW…..Vamos!
This highlights are so short that soon they will become JPEGS
That match point save from Tiafoe was insane. Great match
New players are taking over. I thi k Nadal, Roger and Novak are facing new wave of new players.  I'm so thrilled and happy to see those changes.  Congratulations to both. Fantastic match.
Congratulations to both incredible players. Thanks to Frances and Alcaraz for this magical match !
Im glad he defeated that big n*se man
Absolutely incredible performance from both men! So elated for Carlos. He has been playing an amazing tournament and he def is the favorite goin into the final! He's a fusion of Roger, Rafa, and Novak and it's absolutely insane. Cheers to this young guy's career!
I still think casper will win US open  unless Alcaraz desperately wants this title before him and show us the glimpse of future legend
To those who always say we need Kyrgios to make the game more exciting - Here you have two players with massive talent and excellent showmanship, minus the baby tantrums and intimidation tactics. This is the next generation of tennis heroes!
Yeah, go for it Alcaraz!! Sporting Greetings!!
Sublime!!
Yes! Tennis as it should be! Hahaha!
Sinner said it hurts, and so as Tiafoe. Alcatraz, stop hurting these boys. Casper, don't get hurt. ☺️
Carlos Alcraz final match score 3-0 for C Rud ...😎😱🔥🎾💪💪💯
For me a tell tale sign was Francis trying to pump himself up with an outburst at end of fourth.  There's no conviction in it and the crowd wasn't buying it either. We need to see some tennis and a break of serve from the older more experienced player.  All this post match talk but really Francis should have stepped up to the plate in that 5th and for once taken control of the match.
Big Respect For Francis ,🎾💪💪🤗🙏🙏 In my  view This was Best performance of Francis's career...Whom he will never be able to forget and will also learn from him in future..,I ❤️  love his style of play francis, But Guys One thing Francis  needs to increase his running speed💯.....Which  will come down as the most dangerous player of the future..And I am sure He will do..🔥🔥🔥😎😎💪💪💪💪🎾🎾
Impresionante Alcaraz una bestia!!! Lo que se va a ver de este muchacho…intratable!!! 😀🤙
That point at 0:26.  It's scientifically impossible.  Must be photo-shop or something.
Alcaraz is certainly amazing, however his demeanor and overall attitude on the court are definitely annoying, the continuous arrogance he shows resembles a lot Djokovic's.
This was an incredible hard fought match between these two. I loved watching till the end of this match. Both were gentlemen and it was thrilling till the end. Alcaraz is only 19 and is playing incredible tennis and is unstoppable!
Carloz take revenge his teacher ..😁😁
VAMOS !
You can’t drop shot this kid, he’s just way too fast.  What a match !!!
That’s some amazing defense and shot making by Alcaraz.
This point beginning at 0:12 is unreal, seriously. Could watch it and the spectators reactions over and over again.
An amazing five set match… this compilation shows one single point won by Tiafoe… anyone who watched the match knows the shotmaking by both was incredible. Tiafoe held his nerve and ‘left his f—-ing heart out’ as he said after winning the fourth set. It’s insane to me they are only showing one point won by big foe… Should be called ‘Alcaraz semifinal highlights’ because that’s all this is really showing…
Can you at least include set points? What's the point of these highlights
I am wondering if Carlos Al  Caraz ( may be his original name came from the Arabic language الخراز), will be the next Raphael Nadal 2!?
Vamos vamos Alcaraz, todo el mejor por la final 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Después un descanso de locura
BRAVO ALCA...RAFA SAY HELLO! He will wait for you at ROLLAND GARROS:) Rafa is still the KING... for now..
Noone care about the final. This year US Open has no value. Djokovic is the best!
One of the best matches without a big 3 player I've ever seen
great match!
I’ve seen Djokovic and Monfils but I’ve never ever seen a player track down every ball like alcaraz
Ну чувак даёт третий подряд пятисетовый играет...как будто ему это нравится глядя на его игру ему словно не интересно играть трёх четыр...как можно дальше поиграть уверен что и финал будет подобным тем более соперник ещё сильнее ...!))
Encuentro muy molesto los gritos de Alcaraz cada pelota que pega
Este era el partido para la final, lástima que se cruzaron en la semi... La final va a ser aburrida, Ruud no tiene chances con Alcaraz... en sets corridos va a ganar el español
See how hungry he remains if he wins a slam....It's been a curse for many. The drive of the big three was amazing.
Match was great, but this racist crowd and racist Michelle Obama cheering for guy just because he is black it was hard to watch
All you showed were points alcaraz won… lol
thanks for the stingy highlights
Carlos Alcaraz is no longer a promise to the new era of tennis: he’s reality!
VAMOS 💪🏼Carlitos Alcarez 👍🏼😍
Partidazo!
tiafoe did well until he opened his mouth and talked about how tennis is not diverse enough.  what about nfl, and nba?  the curse of the politically lib correct.
What a classic this will only make Tiafoe better going forward
Took Tiafoe three sets to realize drops don't work with rubber man... Tiafoe needs a new coach
they should test alcaraz for PED usage. alcaraz might not know about it because its his coachings doing.
Amazing stuff. What a talent!
It's a new era and power rules the day again. The courts were slowed down in the early 2000s to stop serve and volley, and since then defensive baseline play has ruled; now we have a new generation with the talent and fitness to turn those baseline rallies into all-court showstoppers and it's fantastic. I'm so excited to see where tennis goes from here
Well done! Congrats to them both!! 👏
All Carlos had to do was take pace off against Tiafoe then he wins easily. Tiafoe feeds off the pace.
Such a great match, I do wish Tiafoe would of busted thru to win the US Open. He has came a long way in a short time and I really love watching him play. Hopefully he gets a major this coming season!
I was cheer for Tiafoe. But, congratulations for both, nice match
that's insane
These guys played ridiculously well. 👏
Love them both! No drama, no crying no slamming rackets and no cursing. Pure enjoyment for the audiences and sportsmanship on court. If this is where the next Gen men's tennis going, I can rest with eyes closed in my grave.
Birth of new champion from Spain 🇪🇸 for next 15 years... perfect substitution of Rafal Nadal...
Once more rud somehow freely goes through to the final with no real competition same as roland garros
this is will be new era of young gun player, so excited for the final
Alcaraz que partido no diste eres el mejor del mundo y lo serás por muchos años Felicidades Campeón
Alcaraz is the real deal. Let's see how he deals with stardom now. There's been plenty of talented young players like him in the past, but only a few can maintain the consistency of the years.
A proven pathological liar with stage 3 dementia is who decided who won't win the US now Closed!
Incredible is less...than reality!!!
Heartbreaking. Francis might have won if his first serve wasn’t 18% in the fifth set
🇪🇸 ftw! Let's go Carlitos! 🔥
Hope Alcaraz goes on to win, he is an amazing player - blend of the resilient Nadal with the finesse of a Roger Federer - which is what Joker became! Unreal!
Another Pete Sampras has been born.  But in a different country this time.
Un Partido increíble con dos buenos jugadores. Carlos Alcaraz se perfila como una leyenda ya!
Nadal no venció pues no está en buen momento físico pero deja a un discípulo digno de futuros campeonatos como Carlos Alcaraz
Auguro una larga y fructífera vida deportiva a nuestro querido Carlitos.  Qué grandes tenistas ha tenido y tiene España y qué buen comportamiento tan deportivo.
Worthy of a final - probably the best movers ever on a tennis court.... unbelievable athleticism!
Two kids with potential to open a new era.
Alcaraz didn't ' survive ' tiafoe . foe was never winning to begin with .
jogar esse esporte é até legal, mais assistir os cabas jogando é triste jogo sem emoção pra quem assiste
his was the first and last time that Tiafoe will be in a GS semifinal, like Gaël Monfils he is a showman
Impresionante! ... amaneciendo en Chile...... tremendo partido gracias a los 2.. .
so sad tiafoe lost but alcaraz is a goat
Bravooooooooo.
Rafa 2.0 has arrived!
It was so close for Tiafoe! Seriously though, it has been few years that Tiafoe's serve has been a liability (at best not his strongest shot). His second serve almost feels like a sitting duck, which is hard to understand given the amount of topspin he can generate on his forehands. I think he needs to get a coach to change his serve technique, which can absolutely take his game to next level. Djokovic's resurgence in the grass game is attributed to his improvement in his serve technique. Why not Tiafoe?
Every highlights show ,showing Serena, people complain on the YouTube comments about how the video only show her highlights Yet this vid showed 85 percent Carlos and not 1 comment complaining about only showing Carlos only highlights That's kinda telling
Big Foe is such a cool guy. It wouldn't have been easy losing a colossal match like this, but the man comes in all hugs and encouragement to alcaraz. I hope this is the beginning for him. As for the terminator, he's the present. What a guy. Kudos to ferrero and team to mould him the way he is.
That *RAWRRRRRR*  0:26 , Even though its a US sided crowd , still neutral when it comes too winning shots.
Alcaraz is a born winner. He has had such an incredible run. He did what Nadal couldn't a few days back, at that time, thankful for that.  High praises for Tiafoe. Raw power & speed isn't everything, it were either Alcaraz or Ruud that were going to him that. Will he be on team World during the Laver Cup!?
Congrats Carlos Alcaraz!  Frances Tiafoe demonstrated grace in defeat.  The future of tennis is bright with these two young men.
An entertaining battle to watch. But the level I felt was so-so, despite a few spectacular rallies. Tiafoe's serve was lacking, with only 47% first serves and just 6 aces in 5 sets, and in total hitting more unforced errors than winners. His level against Nadal was considerably higher.
Alcaraz is doping.
Proud of Frances, what an effort
I was there. Great match!
Alcaraz just better conditioned, got stronger as he went. Great effort by FT, but alcaraz the better player
Very poor upload
Novak who?
Great humans beings...Great guys....incredible fighters...at some point...I didn't know who to support. Alcaraz has been phenomenal..Tiafoe has always been my Gee...had wished it was the finals...kudos to these two great gentlemen...I love you guys...with so much love from Nigeria 🇳🇬
Alcaraz, he may not have Roger Federer as his idol and legendary, but the skill that he has shown in all his games, I  I think he will soon inherit the throne of RF. Brilliant player and makes this sport much more exciting 👏🏻🎾👏🏻🎾👏🏻🎾👏🏻
Yessssssssssssssss Carlitos 👌👏👍
Carlos "Unlimited Pooower!!" Alcaraz
Easily one of the best tennis matches I’ve ever seen
Just stunning tennis! Congrats to both men. Carlos is our superstar of the next 20 years!
Best player in the world ez bet coming thanks phenomenon
Carlos will pack stadiums where ever he plays and spike more interests in tennis.
VAMOOOOOS !!!!!! 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
I wish media will make more emphasis on the importance of great sportsmanship - it is so much needed
Tiafoes biggest advantage (first serve) was nonexistent tonight. If he was making even just a few of them in that 5th set he probably would’ve won
What a match!! Tennis lover who watched live have enjoyed their lifetime..
¡Pocas veces vi un partido de tanta intensidad y mantenido durante tanto tiempo!. El que compró la entrada la compró barata para ver un espectáculo tan sólido y cambiante. Dos monstruos que marcan por quienes va a pasar el tenis de primer nivel durante los  los próximos  diez años. ¡Chapeau!
That was for Nadal.
What a match!
Please don't show the winner in the video thumbnail, please avoid the spoiler.
Carlos is a future champion and I hope he will win his first grandslam in the final. The only worrying factor for him is fatigue and I hope he still has enough left in the tank to win the finals in 3 or 4 sets (another 5 set match would be a killer for him).
Amazing battle ! I wish Tiafoe would've served better, he would've had a serious shot at winning this.
Tiafoe is a pure fighter. he was outplayed for most of the match and still pushed it to five sets. if he improves his first serve he'll be back soon.  Congrats to Carlos, the final should be fun
Amazing game both players are best
Que lindo ver a nuevas generaciones en finales de grand slam, desde muy chico creci viendo a roger y rafa, despues a un joven novak, les veo buena madera a estos chicos, España siempre con excelentes jugadores!
You guy should not spoil the results by putting the winner in the thumbnail.
Alcaraz is the next great grinder.
but do you guys think he's the real deal?
Adorei resultado, faltou respeito pelo adversário, entrou na quadra com torcida total a favor, numa perna, se ferrou, lição para próxima.
This match exhausted me mentally, as Alcaraz fan. So many missed shots and lost opportunities to close it was painful to watch, but i'm glad he didn't let it slip in the end. I want him to achieve as much as possible, this kid is exceptional, and his work ethic and lifestyle is admirable.
Bien Carlitos !!!, ahora por el título !!!
I was there last night, Carlos is great but still commits too many unforced errors... when he matures a bit more, he will be unstoppable: VAMOS!!
The worst  tournament  ever, Serena,  is not the best and not a greatest,  the night  matches are a ridiculous.  The commentators  are fake and boring.......
I am very proud of Mr. Alacaraz. Mr. Nadal is a cheater, a false man and not a true Spanish. Mr. Alcaraz is all the contrary: He is honest, he does not cheat on court and he is truly humble. Mr. Nadal all that pursues is money at any cost: Distracting the opponent in multiples ways, harassing the opponent, stealing the time of the opponent, etc. Mr. Carlos Alcaraz is an unbelievable sport man: Probably he has it all, even being probably an amazing professional tennis player.
The new number 1 player is coming out in tennis world!
This guy Carlos had immense self belief in him.
Ni con todo el público gana a nadie .
Think carlos will be to quick for casper..still hope he does better than at RG final..
Only Alcatraz would be on court so long
I’m so impressed by Tiafoe. His level of play was incredible this tournament, and he showed a ton of growth. Even though this will sting, he should be incredibly proud of himself. He lost to the guy playing the best tennis at the moment, but he stood in there and battled back the entire match.
Красавы, топил за Тиафо, но в финале буду болеть за испанца
who cares  ? we watched tennis for the big 3...............there is no tennis without them.
Dude if Maestro was playin da kid would be terminated long ago
I absolutely love Ruud and wish for him to win slams and even to reach - at some point - number 1 in the world, but for this tournament would be a bit anticlimatic that he takes the title over Alcaraz after the MAD show he has brought.    As the commentator said "Pandemonium in Ashe"  i really don´t think i have ever seen or heard such a reaction from the crowd before, they just stood as one in that first set passing shot he made turning from his back.
why you always show the match winner in the thumbnail of your videos? 😪
Carlos Played great tennis
Impressive how both players managed to manage emotions, specially Alcaraz being so young. Great effort from both, hope Alcaraz goes all the way through
Confused. Why would you show one meaningless point in the first set tie breaker, then segue to the second set, without any stop end to the first set? Who compiles these highlights, awful job, atrocious.
Male tennis is getting interesting again!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 After 10 years of completely boredom!
Ну конечно негр продул, он же негр, они играть не умеют.
720p quality in 2022, what a time
Spain>>>Usa
Alcaraz, SENSACIONAL!
avenging nadal
Чёрный лучше чем шылом бритый.
¡Vamos Carlos!
And he has yet not reached his peak…
He’s winning the open…and becoming n1. Lol
Sad for Tiafoe (Big Foe) but he doomed himself by saying he 'had 2 matches left' after the quarters. A player only has ONE match - the next one and there are no guarantees after that. They need to take one match at a time and not expect to win the next 2.... However, Francis played very well and his time will come.
No novak, there shouldn’t be any points for this tournament 😊
Las 3 C.
What a battle , Alcaraz is a monster
C’est effrayant comme le tennis, sport d’élégance et de stratégie est devenu d’une immonde vulgarité : bras vengeurs, hurlements, bancs hystériques, pitreries d’enfants gâtés, et jusqu’à ces effondrements systématiques sur le cours. Vivement qu’on interdise ce show dégoûtant de narcisses surpayés et mercenaires…
What an incredible match, well played guys 👏👏
ALCARAZ VS TIAFOE =  ROCKY VS APOLO  👊👊👊👊
Just AMAZING
My man showing the world that he's worth every bit of hype
Alcaraz: Nadal with Djokovic's hairstyle
If you don't have kyrgios, you have alcatraz 😜
Muy bien, los dos!!!
I haven’t seen a player with as much energy and instinct like Alvarez in years. It’s crazy. That Tiafoe pushed him to 5 sets is impressive. I nearly gave up on this one after the third set. Looked like a blowout.  This was as tennis should be.
.... ROGER..... STAY AT YOUR OWN HOME......
So many excellent tennis players today but I predict no one will ever replace any of the Big 3. No one can win Grand Slams in their teens to mid 30's. It's virtually impossible. Tennis pros in the future may have even worse records and stats because the playing field just keeps getting more even.
Ruud will win his first Grand Slam. Alcatraz is too tired now. Ruud is more seasoned and he will have a game plan. Prove me wrong!
Stop pumping alcaraz , it si becoming a circus even more so that it already is
2:05 what was that from Tiafoe? So disrespectful
This was a battle!!!  Looked like a Final.  Happy for Alcaraz; awesome game.  Frances, we love you. You shined brightly!!!  Great run....Keep it Going!!!  👍🏻👍🏻
Damitmann.
To show just a few points from an entire match is a joke!
El Jugador Perfecto Español se llama: NadAlcaraz
Cuando una leyenda está en sus últimos años, nace otra, que grande es España sacando grandes jugadores
Thank you Mr. Fuentes . After Rafa, you did a great job with Carlos. Wada continue to sleeping in peace.
Brilliant Alcaraz!  And felicitations to Tiafoe.  He almost made it. I, for one, have been waiting for him to fill the high slot he was made for
Congratulations to Carlos.......
Rudd vs Alcaraz 😘
Let’s be realistic, this kid is currently the best tennis player in the world. I’m a huge Djokovic fan, but he made his choice and isn’t playing, so he’s not in this debate at the moment.
Yeahh,and the real Next Gen is on fire♨️♨️🤓🤓🤓
How can he play 3, 5 setters and still be fresh as a daisy. Someone check for PED. Spain's cheating again like Rafa's historical results that were suddenly destroyed. I'm not fooled. His vasularity last year was not natural without hi tech doping.
The new fed vs rafa saga
NOVAK ĐOKOVIĆ
Alcaroz is nadal2 no doubt on that!!
Alcaraz is just a better player all around, Tiafe had a lot of luck in the tiebreakers otherwise the match should be done earlier.
Seriously you only gave us 3 minutes of highlights for a semi final????
@2:03 khaby vibes
Vaya jugadorazo Alcaraz.. hay futuro y encima nacional, aunque yo creo que aún le falta una cura de humildad, se le ve muy subido, el que ha pasao a Nadal no gustó nada, te queda dentro y fuera de la pista todavía chaval !!
I thought that I had seen it all but that rally at 15sec would have to be one of my favourites ever. The men's game has continued to thrive with a new generation coming through thanks to Rafa, Djokovic and Federer. Bravo.
Mad Respect for Tiafoe. It was all over in the fourth set. He dug deeper into his ownself to find a formidable game that I had never seen him play before. Amazing
Incredible tennis from both 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Foe's match point save 😘😘😘best in recent times
The first "Black American" (new pronouns) to reach a Semi at the U.S. Open since Ashe in '75 and loses! Why put this pressure on this guy! Alcaraz proved to be the better player all around especially with his athleticism! 🔥
Djokovic Djokovic don't forget.
Two of the best of the next generations.
Para vencer no esporte precisa ter talento, muito preparo e competência. Não há lugar para arrogância, prepotência e falta de respeito. O Djoko já dizia há muito tempo que Alcaraz vai longe e, se ele diz, eu acredito! Quanto ao seu oponente nesse jogo, o queridinho da mídia não sei por qual razão, teve o que merecia. Precisa aprender muito ainda!  To win in the sport you need talent, a lot of preparation and competence.  There is no place for arrogance, arrogance and lack of respect.  Djoko has said for a long time that Alcaraz will go far, and if he says it, I believe it!  As for his opponent in this game, the darling of the media for no reason, he got what he deserved.  Still need to learn a lot!
Really wanted Frances to win
1000
I believe every time Carlos plays the crowd will remember these matches vividly, because each match has everything why people want to see and love tennis. He gets the best out of his opponents and then he has to up his game to win it. Alcaraz is the most exciting tennis player to watch. He will have to keep evolving his game because everyone will study how to play against him. Go for it on Sunday!
Tremendous effort from both. Just great 🎾🎾
Estan haciendo fiesta en el Us Open porque Novak Djokovic no esta participando.They are having a party at the us open because Novak Djokovic is not participating.
Bravo Tiafoe
Thank you Carlos for beating the arrogant Tiafoe. I hope this humbled Tiafoe 😂
Tennis just found a new hero.
Was hoping for Tiafoe. You gotta give Alcaraz credit though. He’s one heck of a player.
Grande Carlitos, una más. Me dio pena que perdiera Tiafoe con lo bien que jugó y buena persona que es también. ¡¡¡Gran partido!!!
De Nueva York al Cielo
Carlitos Alcaraz 🙌
Hats off to Carlos Alcaraz. What this kid is doing is amazing! I hope he wins it all.
كارلوس الكاراز ياكبييييير فوز رائع
Come on new gen👍👍👍
Alcaraz needs to stop losing all his tie breakers. This shouldn’t have gone 5 sets.
Alcaraz the showman💪
Extended highlights will be published as soon as broadcast restrictions expire!
Just getting to the Semi-Final was a monumental achievement for U.S. Men's Tennis, Frances.  Work on that volley game, man, and ya gotta react better to your opponent's shots: many easy points were won by Carlito because you didn't react -- look at the match again.  Stay hungry!
I started watching tennis again only because of Carlos Alcaraz!
Alcaraz vs Ruud Final Atp 1000 Miami!
Alcaraz is the best thing that happened to tennis since Fedal.
Whrs dat fuken swan that took out rafa ? Spain has its revenge smashed that swan to the ground.
Usopin is a feeding ground for opportunists when the greats r tried winning all season..
Tegoroczne US Open jest inny bo nie ma starej gwardii .I lubię wszystkich .Jednak wydaje mi się że młodzież zaczyna napierać w całkowicie innym stulu .Przygotowanie fizycznetych młodych chłopaków zapiera dech w piersi 🔥 🔥 .Pozdro
Partidazo de dos buenos tenistas con puntos que hacen afición. Alcaraz tiene un gran porvenir y un hueco entre los grandes del pasado.
Hello US Open! Could you stop putting the picture of the winner in your highlights video's picture? You are just ruining everything for the highlight. You gotta understand the time difference is not in favour for some of us for the live match.
Vamos Carlito!!!
Sensational match .both played well . 5 setter in past games makes it more evident in how carlos is shaping up
Was watching the first 3 sets and it was sad to watch Tiafoe completely losing first serve right after 1 set and overall he seemed too tired and lost interest to fight. Alcaraz just kept going and won it easily.
Super match
One of the best grand slams I remember without any doubt. Two young players fighting for be the n1 of the world.. can’t to watch this !!
fantastic both
Llego a pensar q Carlitos pierde a propósito para dar diversión al público ,es un gamberro adorable y tan buen chico .Sus padres y abuelo han hecho un buen trabajo ,Juan Carlos tbien .
I am an American but a big Nadal fan and now a big Alcaraz fan.
Dimostrazione di tenacia, potenziale adeguato e tecnica superlativa. US OPEN merita di questi giocatori. Da non perdere la finale.🙃
S - stamina
Great ...
Alcaraz: "bro, you wanna see another 5 setter?"
Vamos Carlos 👍🇪🇦💪
He is a superstar
Shame I can’t stand this arrogant rat
At least now we can say the time is up for the big 3 who ruled almost 2 decades of Tennis. These new era is taking over. Alcaraz has a complete game. He has all the qualities of those big 3’s (Roger, Rafa & Novak).
VAMOSS CARLITOS .🇪🇸🇪🇸💪💪🇪🇸🇪🇸💪💪 España y el mundo entero contigo 🇪🇸🇪🇸💪💪🇪🇸🇪🇸
No Fjord hugger will stop this Spanish bulldozer in the final!  Vamos Carlito!
Un mal ganador...ya caerà...
wish djokovic was playing. would add a lot more meaning
Grande Alcaraz 🇪🇸, como siempre los españoles no se rinden nunca." Ya hablaremos de rendición después de muertos" se decía en España.
Why cannot I give 5k likes?
very bad highlight creator. shows only winner points to Carlos.
ボール打ってりゃ金もらえんのか
Alcraz against Rudd in the finals.... irrespective of the nationality, would be difficult to support just one out of the two.... two great athletes, in and out of the court
Great match from both! Hope Alcaraz will win the final, he deserves to.
Alcaraz could cover a football field.
Si merita di vincere gli US open. Complimenti
Back to back 5 set matches and he is still as fresh as new. Looks like we have a heir apparent to the throne now.
Carlos was lucky enough to beat Tiafoe today. Otherwise, his game was overall bad. Congratulations to him. I hope his serve and gameplay improves in the final cause I also want him to win.
I'm glad tiafoe lost,he was acting a fool the whole match
The fact Ruud has made it to two finals this year shows the absolute lack of depth in the men's division. Ruud has an average serve and horrific backhand. Carlos and Sinner are the only new breed of players I can see winning multiple slams. The top 10 is pathetic right now. We used to have Murray, Fed, Novak and Rafa always being consistent and going deep, with Stan and Delpo always a big threat, and then Tomas, Ferrer and Tsonga consistently in the top 10. Now players are getting shuffled around like never before. This era is soft, but Carlos is a savage, which is why he is able to pull out so many matches coming from behind.
🇪🇸
Charlos got a reallt disgusting bigmouth
Clown around now with your neck 🤡🤡 bye-bye
Great match. Tiafoe has made great progress for last year. Very nice to watch him.
Remarkable tennis. Passing of the torch from The Big Three.
Djokovic would've won here easily. Easily.
Alcaraz will be a great champion in the future !!!
Alcatraz looks like real deal next gen player to take the mantle from the 3 greats, lets see how he does in the final...
Wow! 🎾👍🏻🥳
I feel like it's gonna be one sided in final for alcaraz
Is it humanly possible not to show any signs of fatigue after 3 games of 5 sets and 13 plus hours of playing? Is he doping ?
Maybe now with France's Tofu gone the camera men will stop playing 'Where's Black Waldo'.
He's like Nadal and Djokovic spliced into one superhuman tennis terminator! Astonishing player. 😳😲
How did Tiafoe reach the semifinals is what I don't get
He's going to be problem to those in his front and to those in his back. Alcaras
🔥🔥
Alcaraz has played 3 matchs in 5 sets in a row. Has he got enough energy left to take the title ? If he does then that kid is on track to get a dozen of grand slams under his belt and more
What a match alcaraz is a legend 😂
Some youtubers say....remind me young Rafa. Dont remind you nothing...lambones.
Alcaraz = entertainment
0:23 vamos Carlitos vaya puntazo.
Alcaraz pudo resolver en tres sets se complica mucho la vida tiene que madurar
Well deserved win for Alcatraz, amazing player.
Классный зрелищный теннис! Молодёжь достойная, после ухода на пенсию монстров будет на что посмотреть ближайшие 10-15 лет. Cool spectacular tennis! The young people are decent, after retirement they will have something to look at for the next 10-15 years.
Terrible highlights to be honest.
Vamos Charly uno más…🇪🇸
We are slowly seeing the changing of the guard and the great 3 are struggling with fitness well certainly Nadal and Fed I guess djock is still an anomaly
My boy Alcaraz winning the title for sure…. 🔥
Alcaraz is determined to win this one...Even if he has to die on court. His third 5 setter..Ruud will be desperate 2..Hoping for a great final.
la deportividad en el tenis me encanta...ese abrazo final despues de 5h de lucha es la grandeza de este deporte ..
Alcaraz he play really amazing.
Seems like Rafa is Playing Right Handed !!
następca Rafy Nadala!
Vamosss👏👏👏
The futur tennis 🎾 generation
Carlos could end this match 1 hour earlier actually.
Love both these guys espesiilly alcaraz
I am Rafael Nadal fan but i support Carlitos Alcaraz on Sunday :D
I'm from Spain, and I think the New York crowd is fantastic. Probably the best audience in the world. A great match!
لاعب من طينة الكبار ومن الطراز الرفيع لديه موهبة ربانية في هذه اللعبة ويتميز بأسلوب رائع في التبادلات اتوقع يفوز بالبطولة
Tiafoee produced great performance in this tournament . It s a pitty he crossed Alcaraz's path in the semis. This should be the final
As someone who routinely roots against American players, I think Tiafoe has been an absolute delight and I look forward to his sucess for many years to come.
Carlos Alcaraz is the 2022 US Open Champion!! He combines the resilience and flexibility of Novak and the fighting spirit of Nadal. There is no stopping him!!
Carlitos for first grand slam!
What an UNBELIEVABLE match from both but especially Tiafoe, I didn't expect him to make it to a fifth set after set 2 and 3. Great fighting spirit, wow! And Alcaráz, well there are hardly any words to describe what he does on the court isn't there 🤣🤯 Absolutely outstanding. Rooting for Ruud a little more in the final but man to think about the future that kid has ....
Both players are Ossam...........
A big applause to Tiafoe but i remain of the opinion that the only one who can try to stand up to Carlos in the future remains Jannik. Ruud i think has no chanche
It is a real spectacle to watch this 19-year-old boy play.
those young legs
Alcaraz is a machine, genius player, gliders,sliders Sprints, uamatchable tp.any player,in the past or present
Curious as to why they didn't show Tiafoe taking the first set. 🤔
I see a young and stronger Novak in Alcaraz. This kid is going to be a dominant star for many years to come and I sincerely hope there won’t be any injuries that will hamper his athletic plays. I am a long time Novak fan and I wish Novak gets to play with Alcaraz in this tournament. It would’ve been a fun match!
El moreno para un punto bueno que hace, se mofa de los gestos de Alcaraz 😁😁
Rafa 2.0
This crowd !!!
That was unbelievable!  Big guys with tennis skill, touch and  huge power, using every inch of the court.  Been watching studying and playing tennis since Amateur days of Laver and Billie Jean King. Our tennis now is out of this world!  I love this game .
It's a travesty that Djokovic couldn't play. It makes absolutely zero sense.
Incredible.
Alcaraz vs Ruud will be an epic final. New players will take over the old horses. Will love to see Alcaraz vs Djokovic.
If the big 3 have been the biggest champions in the history of tennis, this kid will be the champion of champions, the goat of goats, the one who will lift tennis to the closest level to perfection.
That outfit itself is a loser...
I hate these nerd
I remember the first time I watched Tiafoe was in Hopman's cup in Australia when he was in mixed team with Serena against Roger and Belinda.That tournament he was even unable to rally with WTA players and the level he has achieved now is just fantastic . Superb improvement. He needs to increase his ranking now by playing many smaller tournaments
Alcaraz avenged Nadal.
Future Champs !
Alcaraz againts Ruud
Maybe its just me but im only WatchKit ng these highlights so always seeing the winner in the thumbnail is quiet the spoiler :/
this kid carlitos never gets tired, the longer he plays the better he becomes, no doubt in my mind he will beat ruud and he will become #1 in the world..
Both are too incredible..
incredible of alcaraz,
Класс показывают, спринтеры
Great come back in the 4th by foe
Go Novak!!
Yeahhhhhh 😍😍😍
Alcaraz speed insane
Is Tiafoe imitating Alcaraz at 2:02 ? :D
Three 5 setters reveal that CA prefers long matches  in the final nerves, stamina, history all matter and whoever handles better will prevail... Casper has advantage of playing a second final, normally first final of a slam is heavy on some players.
Ruud has to invent something extraordinary to beat this Alcaraz...
that handshake tho
Go Carlitos, go!
I don't watch tennis religiously or as often as I should, but, I just can't see Rudd causing Alcaraz any problems. I might even place a bet on the latter winning in straight sets. Thoughts?
Boycott US OPEN. Boycott the dictators of the current government of USA. I will never see this competition rigged.
Such a shame for Francis but great to see him fulfilling some of his potential... The right result I think for tennis new champion and new no 1 and noone can claim the no 1 spot without being a GS champion...
I don't like this man because he imitates nadal in his joys, because he can't be himself !
Its funny that when Nadal’s career going to its end new young Spanish star is born
Chan, Becker and Nadal all won GS as teenagers not two as stated. Becker won twice GS at age of 18 years old.
Watching Alcaraz is like viewing a human highlight film. Tiafoe had some moments too.   You literally could make a movie with Alcaraz embarrassing the best tennis players with some of his shots. I think the changing of the guard from the old generation of Nadal and Federer is changing to these new young players.
Spanish tennis still have future after Nadal legacy
Jajaja Carlitos a la gran final!! Lo siento por el pobre Frances, que ha hecho un torneo casi perfecto, pero los errores no forzados lo han condenado una vez más!
Carlos is a machine unbeatable
Grande Alcaraz! Está a nada de ganar el primer Grand Slam... de muchos.
Tiafoe ran,ran and ran but didn't escape from Alcaraz
The beginning of a great new rivalry. All the best to Mr Tiafoe, great run great tennis, your time is here.
He looks like a young Jerry Lewis.
Indescriptible partido Carlos ..menuda batalla habéis tenido gracias a los dos por este regalo!
Top 10 points of 2022: 1. Alcaraz 2. Alcaraz 3. Alcaraz 4. Alcaraz 5. Alcaraz 6. Alcaraz 7. Alcaraz 8. Alcaraz 9. Alcaraz 10. Alcaraz  That is all.
He covers the court like a young Nadal.
Tiafoe is a phenomenal athlete yet Alcaraz made him almost look slow
Big respect for both, the New génération is here !
New Goat
Djokovic would've owned these losers
Enhorabuena,  Carlos !!!! Eres increíble  !!!!
Alcaraz at 25 will be a monster of tennis
ALCARAZ PERDERÁ LA FINAL Y NO SERÁ NÚMERO 1.  AL TIEMPO...
This was the real final for me..!❤️💪
He can be the GOAT!
720p? YOU CANNOT BE SERIOUS?
STOP SPOILERING THE WINNER IN THE THUMBNAIL
ESPAÑAAAAAAA
WELCOME TO THE NEW AGE
1:27 Alcaraz charges himself just like rafa

Two baby Nadal in final
Incredible match but they clearly need to work on their man hugs.
Alcaraz con 19,  apurando a los mejores tenistas del mundo.
Me recuerda a sampras, la técnica, la manera de moverse, es muy parecida
My man alcaraz. Keep going, keep going. This is just the beginning.
This all coz djokovic nd zverev r missing
¡Vamos Carlitoooos!! A por la final, que calidad, podría haber rematado el partido antes, pero es un fenómeno y le pueden las ganas de hacerlo bonito.
Wow,after a earlier marathon match *he still had the power and guts!
Of course Ruud or Alcaraz are not really going to be Number 1. Whithout politics Djokovic still would be far ahead and Medvedev probably would be second ranked. I wish Ruud and Alcaraz will have the sportsmanship to point that out very clear!  The titles of the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open are ... well ... worthless this year. They should rename this Tournaments. Maybe Australian Vaxxed, Wimbledon the Wall and US Vaxxed. Just to make clear these are special titles. There should be no ATP Points for these exclusiv tournaments. Politics destroyed the competition - also for the maiden titles of these fine young players. Unacceptable!
Wow, Carlos made big foe a small foe!
This. Is. Tennis.
Number one alcazar(baby nadal) :))
Tremendo Carlos Alcaraz 💪
!!!
Alcaraz wins Rudd in 4 sets on Sunday!
It was kind of obvious in the beginning that Alcaraz was the stronger and smarter player. Kudos to both players for giving their all.
Молодцы,отличный матч достойный полуфинала.Браво обоим . Тиафу и Алькараз показали зрителям всю прелесть и все элементы большого тенниса.Молодцы,Браво!
Vamos Carlos!!If he wins he will become the next legend in tennis for a long time.
I can’t believe this two younger players will win their 1st grandslam title before Tsitsipas and Zverev.
Tiafoe really needs to work on his volleys. You can't just tap it over the net when your opponent moves as well as Alcaraz, there needs to be intent.
I hope Carlitos wins this GS, the first of many more to come! ♥
Que grande Carlos igual que Rafa, dos grandes tenistas
Dos futuros campeones en todo su esplendor. El relevo de los grandes está asegurado.
King Carlos after 2003. and final as player did the same, and can go one step farther as coach. Well done!!✔️
Sincerely this young man Alcaraz is from another planet, energy, zeal, skills, and focus he possessed are amazing, I wish he becomes world No1 next Monday
that hug at the end tho 😅
Vamos Carlossss 💪❤🇪🇸
Frances Tiafoe is a great hope of US tennis going forward !!!   Congratulations to Carlos Alcaraz for making his 1st US Open final
Vamos Carlitos!! This brah is gonna ensure Rafa keeps the all time Grand Slam record - he will easily beat Nole
The final is already written.....this guy is the new US Open champion.
Everything is going to sweep as I feel. The wind is too strong this time, Relentless!!!
Federer is much better
I am just in amazement looking at Alcaraz’s athletic ability
Io credo che lo US OPEN lo vinca Ruud facilmente
Alcatraz’s play is so similar to Rafa’s with those lobs. So proud of him for reaching the final. Hopefully he wins it all.
Rafa Nadal aurait dû serré dans ses bras tifaoe comme tifaoe la fait
Great  match 1St set & 4th set  wounders
Yesss Alcaraz...U make its. Be cool & you will be the champions 🎾🏆🤲
Why Alcaraz often win by 5 SET? Cool.
BRAVO CARLITOS!!! una vez más nos dejas asombrados, eres un gladiador con mucha clase.
Descomunal la Bestia de Carlin! muy bién por Tiafoe también, felicidades!!
Va-t-on se rendre compte un jour que ça mec est plein à craquer au même titre que Nadal et que aucun des deux n’a de mérite. J’espère qu’un jour il leur verront enlever tout leur titre
Vamos! Carlos, simply awesome....bring it home.
I hope they dobt says "dopped"
The men's and women's US Open finals promises to be very exiting and well-matched. Carlos v Casper, Ons v Iga - Great way to end the 2022 Grand Slams! =)
FENOMENAL!!!!! Bravo Carlos!!!!
Nice to see new talent getting sick of djok winning
Both the QF and this Sf matches were worth being the finals of the US Open 2022. After such magnificent victories, I wish Alcaraz will win the finals!!
Why  it's called  a highlights ... No set ponts.. Not many thrilling points... Shame it's official video
Brilliant, another big four
El rey ha muerto, viva el rey!
Tenemos un fenómeno y digno sustituto de otro gran monstruo español. Bien acompañado ha llegado y continuará en lo más alto de la gloria del show tenístico Pro.
Put Djokovic's resilience and phisicallity and mix it with Federer's variety and quality of shots, you simply get an Alcaraz. He's made of champions material.
Alcatraz
Ну какой Рууд. ну камон.... Завтра заберет шлем, заслуженно.
Алькарас машина
its like watching 2nd grade competition ... what is this... 250 tournament?
I want Casper Ruud be the champion
Actually, I didnt like this man anytime…
It's scary that he's only 19
Just EPIc, all I can say on a game like this. Salute to both players making tennis an even greater sport.
Tiafoe, una cosa.. Alcaraz es mejor que tú y hace puntos más espectaculares que tú. Con lo de hoy ya te habrá quedado suficientemente claro, venga, hasta otra majete
I have seen the future if tennis and its name is Carlos.
Nobody expected the final being Alcaraz vs Ruud
911 inside job Controlled demolition
Ruud is super cool. I love both. I hope alcaraz has enough in the tank 😍😍
The wheels on Carlitos go round and round...at 100mph. This kid has the best retrieval skills on tour hands down.
nadal and alcaraz share nationality, sport and love for substances !!
Am I the only one that the game of Alcaraz reminds me Justine Henin's game?
Grand finale. Alcaraz not only beat Tiafoe but also the crowd. However, I believed the crowd will be rooting for him in final and Ruud is the underdog.
i genuienly dont like Alcaraz. he is of course a fitness monster but he and his team are coming across as just too arrogant in my opinion. besides that, he is deserving a GS very soon for what he is doing. Still, Sinner and Ruud are of a different class in terms of composure.
the real physical beast
Finally no so called big 3 or 4
Noone  deserves this grand slam more than you Carlos Go lift your trophy 🏆
Fabuloso, bravo. ESPAÑA
Hope Carlitos recovers well. I like both players tho.
im afraid carlitos will be prone to injuries with the way he plays
Future of tennis, he owns the mental toughness like Nole, aka Carlos Alcaraz
I didn’t know Michelle was such a big tennis fan. They say , she was there to show her support for Alcaraz. 🤔
Alcaraz has a physical edge over Tiafoe. Don't think Rudd's slow ball can shake Alcaraz.
0:12- One of, if not the best, points I've ever seen.
Tiafoe’s imitating Alcaraz expression at 2:02 is fantastic 😂
el publico americano animando a Alcaraz en ve de a su conpratriota que puta verguenza
another Nadal is cooking...
0:13 thats not human
!
Stop putting the winner in the thumbnail..
When it goes to 5 sets, no one is better than Novak. Even alcaraz seems indestructible. Waiting for their first slam meeting!
Yes Alcaraz has been great but Ruud has been effective. Alcaraz goes too big in crucial points leading to ufe. Too many times today unnecessary. Ruud has a legit chance. With no.1 spot up for grabs, it's going to come down to nerves!
A well deserved win. 👏  Superb match. Congrats Alcaraz.👏👏👏
Alcaraz is gonna send Rafa and Novak early into retirement. No doubt about that!
Both Rudd and Alcaraz deserve the US open GS
Something about the attitude of this Carlos Alcaraz kid that I can’t stand. He seems to be extremely arrogant at times.
Tiafoe needs to improve in drop shots, the way Tiafoe appreciated Carlos as a young brother by giving him a hug at end of the match is true sportsmanship ...Tiafoe will lift a Grand slam in coming days , congratzz Carlos 👍👍
Alcaraz is a freak of nature just like Rafa in terms of physicality! We've all been talking about him since last USO. But the way this guy has fought through a period when the next big thing in tennis awaits has made it even more difficult. Rising like a phoenix!
Teenager pero no veas como juega
Alcatraz Is ridiculous, in few time he abdicted at superiour varius player 🤡
What a match: The wizard of Oz Vs. the Ninja Turtle. The Wizard of Oz won. Congratulations CarlOZ 💪 CarlOZ is now officially NUMBER ONE in the world 🍺🍺🙋‍♂🙋‍♂😎😎 CarlOZ ! CarlOZ! CarlOZ!
Ha vinto il giocatore più forte… Vamos CARLOS!
Can anyone explain why the players sometimes wear similar colored clothing when playing each other or is it just coincidence?
At this stage literally the only reason that you would doubt Alcaraz' talent (or Tiafoe's) is if you are so obsessed with Nadal, Djokovic or Federer that seeing anyone else play jaw-dropping, entertaining tennis is seen as a threat. How can you hate this? it's electric.
Te lo advertí Tiafoe, Alcaraz te iba a realizar muchas dejaditas y globitos que te iban a desgastar dado que tú tienes más peso.
As a Spanish person I am gutted to see Nadal's career coming to an end. He's been a constant in our lives for almost 20 years. Today the future looks bright.
Hope rudd finish this alcaraz !
2:08  "Tiafoe's first serve percentage in this fifth set is 18%".  LOL, what a clown. The fifth set  was *never* in doubt.
Future tennis legends
To take nothing against Tiafoe, Alcaraz is just magnificent. The kid has it all. He is SUCH an exciting player, and long may he reign!
Alcaraz and Tiafoe played a great match and kudos to both for giving it their all. Tiafoe made it much closer than I thought it would be. As great as Carlos has been, he really needs to figure out how to play the break points and tiebreaks better. His attention to detail and decision making was questionable at times and needs to improve on the important points. Both matches, vs Sinner and Tiafoe, could have and should have been finished sooner. Alcaraz can get away with it now because of his youth and avoiding Djokovic and Zverev, but going forward, he will need to address these things to avoid burning too much energy and beating the very best.
Tiafoe's so entertaining. I love watching his matches
🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
This must have been the best match from Alcaraz that I've seen. Yes, not as spectacular as the previous with Sinner but he had to win it.  I have critisized before Carlos' lack of consistence, his too much ups and downs on a match, his lack of patience at some key points... Today I think he played a chess game, seeing that Tiafoe didn't hold the rallies he chose to hit less close to the lines, risking a bit less, making Francis play.  Not every oponent is the same and adapting for each game is a tremendous virtue. I hope Carlos will keep on this track.
Rafael nadal in the making
Vamos Carlos!! Olé tus huevos. España y el mundo entero está contigo. Ganes o no eres un ídolo porque te dejas la vida en la pista. Eres un espectáculo
Great battle gentlemen! I respect them both so much as players and as people! I didn’t want to see either of them lose, well fought I expect a bright future for both of you!
Man that drop shot on matchpoint is ridiculous.  So is the passingshot from Alcaraz in the first set.
It’s Rafa Fan Vs Rafa Academy in the US Open Final 2022
For those guys undermining the youngsters, remeber that Djokovic lost in 1st round to Marat safin at 2005 aus open
Déçu pour Tiafoe, j'aurais aimé qu'il batte Alcaraz.
Carlos es de otra Galaxia, vaya forma más espectacular de jugar al tenis, sigo pensando que será el mejor de los mejores.
It's such an honour to watch this 19 year old play tennis like this. Quality shots and endurance to last three 5 setters in the last three matches. Yes, he is playing opponents wo are the absolute best but he is proving his worth.
Why does Tiafoe look so arrogant on the court?
Spoiling us with the cover…
Kids the real deal
Bravo pas facile de s'évader dalcatraz  il es incroyable ce joueur il ramène toutes les balles. Il à un volonté  unique. Il y croit toujours bravo aussi à l'américain il à fait un bon match. Mais c'était presque impossible de gagner face à un tel joueur. Bravo messieurs
Sinner vs Alcaraz is the real championship match.
Quá hay
Will be a great final. Alkaras it’s new Nadal. Ruud it’s new Djokovic.
Who was the other teenager in the final?
Both players are incredible.
After seeing the quality of Alcaraz's last two matches, friendly Casper is going to "Ghost" the finals and is already packing his bags, on a one way flight to Oslo.  He left a note to Alcaraz "Not be Ruud, but I don't want to get bagled in the finals" 😅😅
That hug at the end 😂
Thank you carlos for 10000$.
Thumbnail spoiler = inst dislike
Tiafoe is great, Alcaraz is magical!
Dont know how Alcaraz gets to that ball at 0:20. Thought the ball was  behind him and he was gonna go for a tweener. Instead he faces the side fence and shovels it back. Dont think Ive ever seen that shot. 🤔
Hats off to both players & Alcaraz especially for reaching the final; but this video literally shows Tiafoe winning 2 points in what was a 5 set thriller.. Atleast show the points the man won on set point to paint the picture!!
Whenever I watch Alcaraz play on the hardcourt, I feel like I need my hamstring massaged.
Карлос феноменален! Какая игра, загляденье! Браво, Карлос! Давай уже на Трон, заслужил! 👋
The quality reached the level of Djkocovic/Nadal/Federer. I believe the GOAT 3 will not be able to win another GS anymore…
I love how Carlos forcefully moves Frances's hands to embrace him😅😅😅
Please, a litter longer next time!
Alcaraz played too many 5 setters. Don't know if he would be fit enough to win the first GS.
Youth is a big factor and the skills to go with it. Both played very well.
last 2 weeks he has played 3 times 5 setter. way to go CARLOS
Only the beast from Serbia-- Novak Djokovic can stop this version of Alcaraz. He's going to destroy everyone else.
Only won point from Tiafoe in those highlights is him saving match point. Totally unfair.
From the first time i watch him play i knew this boy is special. Said the same thg abt rafa when he was a young boy.
simply stunning no words to explain
unbelievable carlos alcaraz the next rafa nadal
Tiafoe soprattutto fortunato ad essere arrivato fin qui.
Alcaraz to go all the way!! 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸 VAMOS
Last year woman single final was the most awaited match, but this year definitely man single final
Congrats, Alcaraz! You will be the newly crowned US Open champion🏆 🥇.  Your humility, simplicity, hard work, tenacity, power, balance, endurance, and above all God's grace paid off.  Many blessings to 🇪🇸 and you! Prince Arran
Tiafoe totally not likeable.
Tiafoe has a lot to offer, Alcaraz is just out of this planet. I was starting to prepare myself for a new age in Tennis, one where more players contest the bigger titles, but it seems a couple of them are setting up to demonstrate the potential of the Big 3. This USO is going to stay in history, some matches have been unique, the energy has been second to none.
I know nothing about tennis,but this Spaniards player has 4 lungs.
Alcaraz ❤️🇪🇦
MUCHOS CRACIAS CARLOS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alcaraz loves 5 setters.  I think he purposely goes there for the fun.  Hope he has enough energy for the final.
What kind of junk highlights are these?
i am surprised tia came back and won 4th set.. I looked like he ran out of gas on 3rd set
i hate to add negativity, but what is with these highlights? no set points shown, no critical break points shown. only 2 mins from a 4 hour match? They'll bring out a 40 min extended highlights, but surely there should be some 10 minute ish highlights showing the critical points and the most entertaining ones. its not that hard
Let me guess who won... just check the thumbnail for the spoiler.
Bravo Alcaraz, you teached him a lesson, didn't like his attitude, great final!
los jugadores afrodesendientes  tienen siempre un plus en su fisico  el tenis es un desgastes fisico o al menos asi parece   pero del otro lado un jugador tambien potente  ambos buenos  y de lo mejor que se ha visto no soy muy seguidor del tenis por ser de argentina a veces sigo a argentinos  que estan con buen nivel de arratos pero lo de estos dos son un show    veremos la final como sera
Imagine a prime Novak Djokovic vs. this Carlos Alcaraz battling it out in the finals of the US open. That would have been the battle for the ages.
Close battle, can't help but feeling for Frances as well. He played a fantastic tournament and also had Alcaraz on the verge of defeat. Surprised about how everyone feels Alcaraz has won the final already. 2nd GS final for Ruud this year, he plays incredible tennis. I see it 50:50.
Alcaraz is insane. He's an incredible player. Hope he wins the title 🙏. Will be a worthy champion as he has played three 5 set matches in a row. The future of men's tennis looks exciting with his talent. The match between Alcaraz and Sinner was epic. Rudd is a talented player too
vamos alcaraz🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
We all are witnessing greatness again, its only early but this looks promising, alcaraz might be the person who elevates other tennis players ability. Competition/rivalry is always a great way to be forced to improve your game.
Alcaraz amazing i hope you the first winners US OPEN 22 Great Amazing
Me gustan  los. Dos  bien por alcaraz
I knew the American will loose when he came out wearing a GOAT hoodie😬
The only person on the planet who can take on Alcaraz and possibly defeat him on hard courts right now... is Novak Djokovic-- And they decided to boycott him.   No one else,  other than a fit Rafa, comes close to defeating 'this' version of Carlos Alcaraz. Period.  Both the Sinner and Tiafoe match should have been closed out in 3 sets.
Great match
Great job now in final you can call the best player in the world Djokovic and let him play
This feels like the Championship already 🏆
Carlos needs to work on winning more tiebreaks 😅
what a player
its very obvious who win in this match based on the picture of alcaraz.
Carlos alcaraz is going to be us open champion
Today Carlos Alcaraz is the most talented tennis player! It is a great pleasure to watch him playing tennis. Simply magic!
Amazing Carlos!!!!
Can somebody from the future reply to this in 2035 and tell me what happened to Alcaraz at the end?
Props to Alcaraz, but imo this was Tiafoe's break through tournament. He played unbelievable, future-world-number-one tennis
Ohhh he is the Kwisatz Haderach
Two of the nicest, not to mention with talents, guys, Casper and Carlos, on court in the final.
Vamos Carlitos! 💜
Alcatraz wins US Open,  Ruud doesn't really stand a chance.  😕
I think the lights got to Tiafoe a little more this match, with how poorly he served. That being said, this was a great battle. Im very interested to see where Tiafoe goes from here, as he could do the classic american mens tennis player thing and fade into relative obscurity, or continue fighting in slam quarters.  As far as Carlos, Im not even sure anything needs to be said, its all so clear out there.
Have you ever seen Andy Murray Lobbing?
Let's go Casper
Man! Alcaraz has got the baseline skill and warrior mentality of Novak.  The mid-court, net game and ruthless attacking mindset of a prime Federer. And the defensive ability and mental equanimity of Nadal.   But he's the first Carlos Alcaraz. Definitely GOAT potential.
What does Tiafoe do at 02:02???
2:52 awkward!!!
Карлос, научись играть тай брейки и будешь королем
Should have won 3-1, lacked the ruthlessness to put it away early
Espectacular Tiafoe todo el torneo. Mucha suerte para el gran Alcaraz en la final
Carlos should have won in 3 straight sets.
Tennis doesn't need Nadal and Novak with young players playing like this. They can both retire today.
because of thumbnail, views can predict the result of the match. awful,,
Alcaraz with Nadal DNA..never say die
winning 3 back-to-back 5 setters is no joke - I just hope he has enough left in the tank for what could be another grueling 5 setter
썸네일 스포 너무 구리다 하,, 구독취소하고 spotv만 봐야겠다
Congratulations on making a super game. Hopefully you will win the final Alcaraz you deserve a number
Would you mind having pictures of both players on your thumbnails as to not spoil the results?
Tiafoe played his heart out and was understandably emotional at the end of it. But honestly Alcaraz could have closed it out in 3 sets.   The quality in ground strokes was visibly perceptible in today's match. Tiafoe had no answer to Alcaraz's blistering pace, especially the BH to BH exchange. The Sinner match was more equally matched.
Vamos Carlos!! 🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸
Tiafoe is a 🤡 He’s a football player in a tennis court
It's scares me to think what this guy will be like at 24-25 years old
Alcaraz really needs to improve on tie break. Everytime is a tie break he loses it and the same thing happened with Janik , hopefully it won't happen with Casper Rudd lol. Want him to win the Us Open Grandslam.
Tfo just didn't play this game like the last two wins. Wasn't hungry enough to chase & follow through with  every ball. But Alcaraz was.
Alcaraz amazing tennis talent but his physicality/athleticism is on a different level. Just like nadal
🗣🎙I’m a black American 🇺🇸✊🏽 tennis player and 🎾 superfan and I was unapologetically NOT rooting for Tiafoe. Alcaraz for the US Open 2022 title❕🇺🇸🎾🏆 Vamos baby Rafa❕Vamos❕💪🏼💪🏽
Two gentlemen players. Graceful even in defeat. No antics, no broken racquets. It could've gone either way. Thrilling till the end.
didnt realize tiafoes 1st serve was so massive, if he starts landing them more often he will be a bigger problem
Clearly! the NEW GENERATIONS are coming!!!
Carlitos the prodigy simply outclassed Clubber Lang and sent him back to the locker room without a bag😆
Congrats to Carlito Alcaraz for another outstanding performance!! Vamos!!
Cant he keep his mouth shut ? Only see pictures with big mouth wide open 😜
This Alcaraz guy if you said he was 35 years old and a 20 year professional I'd believe you  Unbelievable composure in every match I've seen him play
A high level battle, Alcaraz vs Tiafoe cannon ball vs cannon ball  so explosive, eventually Carlos Alcaraz advancing to the final will face Casper Ruud
3 min of highlights of 2 guys who play every point like highlight reel. I have given up on the admin of this channel.   The same thing happened in this last game which was a 5 hour plus  match. Please guys
Nadal 2.0..Vamos!
The competition in the final will be for the first title in the Grand Prix and also for the top spot for the first time For Ruud, he has developed his attacking style after he was exaggerating in defense and also improved his backhand and most importantly, he is mentally solid. As Alcaraz, he is in an excellent condition, and he mixes attack and defense with more rush to attack, but he played two marathon matches 14 hours and a half, so we will see how it affects his fitness, which I see is in the interest of Ruud
Both are very gentle players
Eh !! Eh ! Alcaraz eh 👂 Eh ! 👂👂 Eh ! 👂 Eh ! 👂☝️Eh ! 👂
Frances needs to improve his volleyball, especially the net ball. It should be a dead ball but gives his opponent chance to fight back.
VAMOS, VAMOOOOO CARLITOS. VIVA ESPAÑA!!!!!
Playing for 15hrs from the last three matches and playing 15 sets and winning all of them is literally World Number 1 stuff!
Spain found heir to Nadal while Nadal is still playing
At least Alcaraz knows he won’t be playing past midnight on Sunday!  His mum must be getting angry at the USTA for keeping her son up way past his bedtime 😴
It was a big battle, because when it seemed that Alcaraz was about to win the match in four sets, Tiafoe came back to this putting a big effort while the crowd cheering him and there was an interesting five set in which anyone of both had many chances for winning.  At the end, the winner was one of them, as it always happens, but when there are matches like this, tennis wins definitively.
19 yr old grand slam champion that would be incredible for the game of tennis
that hug at the end of the match is something I wish to see more often
People daring to even mention the word GOAT need to come back in 15-20 years lol. He needs 23+ Slams, 40 Masters, 100+ tournaments overall, 8 year end world number one spots, almost 400 weeks as world number 1 etc. It's a very very long road for anyone to even be in the conversation thanks to what Big Three have done over the past 20 years.
0:16
Tiafoe needs to work on his dropshots and volleys. He could have easily taken few of the points that he lost while hitting a high and slow drop shot.. but its carlos on  the other side so its not guranteed :)
I remember when people were saying that non-wooden rackets would ruin the game, that it would be all about power. There is SOO much control and touch, in the modern game. I tend to think Alcaraz makes things harder on himself than necessary, but he is a LOT of fun to watch. Tiafoe has a similar skill set, in that it's all-court, ALL the time. These two are awesome.
After watching this match I'm confident that the game of tennis will live on after the big three all retire. Tiafoe gave everything he had and Alcaraz just keeps producing magic every time he plays🔥 Both should be proud!
For me it is clear that Alcaraz will dominate tennis over the next few years. His game intelligence is too great. Too great his physical superiority. And his further development potential is too great because he is only 19! Djokovic will also have to see that next year. Tennis has a new king
Menuda euforia los dos jugadores desprendiendo grandes juegos y puntos de este usa open🔥🙌
Carlos oozes all time great aura and i  I love his brand of boom boom tennis. Scary thing is he has yet to get competition like big three to challenge him or else he gonna sweep slams.
Alcaraz... brother... you are on a very different level... same as nadal or maybe better... keep it up... you better be the next GOAT...
Amazing match. Frances gave absolutely everything he had. Carlos is a monster. He is the guy up next, or now. #1 on the line on Sunday, and also the first major for Ruud and Alcaraz. Let's go!
Who will be the Next Dominating Champion in Tennis for Next 10 years ? Carlos Alcaraz, D Medvedev, J Sinner, A Zverev, C Ruud, Tsistsipas, Norrie, Rublev, N Kygrios.
This boy has it all except massive serve ( earlier nadal lacked that too). Once he get it he gonna be unstoppable. Speed, nuclear groundstrokes, lobs, drop shots, volleys. Next great in making
A future great to root for with great attacking game. He has that x factor and aura. Loved Roger and Nadal. Never got into djokovic's and murray's defensive games. So win for me lol
Вперёд Карлос , весь мир за тебя !
alcaraz consistently hits insane shots every match
carlos alcaraz   el siguiente fenomeno del tenis,, pero no creo que supere los 22 gran slams de  RAFA NADAL,,,
Carlos is all time great in making. Saw same in nadal and djokovic. Never saw same in zverev types. And this boy has attacking game. Everything to stan for after Roger's void
I've been following tennis for a long time and I don't remember a player in history that combines potency+athleticism like Alcaraz. (Prime Djokovic maybe? 🤔)
This has definitely been Alcaraz tournament his just play tennis worth the spectators money
It's not carlos alcaraz... it's speedy gonzalez...
You guys stink at highlights for real lol
Legendary status achieved
It’s crazy how much Alcaraz has been through to reach the final. It really would be remarkable if he can beat Ruud to become the youngest number 1 in the Open Era and youngest male player to win a slam since Nadal in 2005. So much at stake in the final but I do believe he’ll win it. He’s a level above Ruud when playing like this.
Today, New ATP Ranking- 1) C Alcaraz, 2) C Ruud, 3) R Nadal, 4) Daniil Medvedev, 5) Alexander Zverev, 6) S Tsitsipas, 7) N Djokovic. Future is secure with young players.
Alcaraz v Rudd and the winner gets his first Grand Slam and the world No. 1 ranking. Loser will be world No. 2 with Rafa at No. 3.  Tiafo has stepped up big time and should become a top 10 player. Exciting time for Men’s Singles with so many great players vying for No. 1 and Grand Slams.
Alcaraz married me ..I love u so much🥰
Tiafoe is a very nice guy on tour.. wish he pulled it off.. come back man.. keep your promise..
carlos has really earned the finals, well played both.

5 set game is more about stamina then anything else Tiafoe in 5th set was dependent on his serve & Alcatraz mistakes in order to win!
What a match, feel choked for Big Foe but he’ll be back and he will win the title one day. Today wasn’t his day but he put up such a great fight. He should be proud and hold his head high. ALCARAZ is just not human!!! Insane shots!
until next game Tiafoe, dont cry, you're not a loser

great fight from tiafoe gave everything he had 💪👏 and alcaraz i have no words left tbh .. i refuse to believe that he is human at this point .. he does things on court that i never seen before and shouldnt even be possible .. young 🐐.
Jesus loves you!!
💪🏻🇪🇦💥🔥🔥🔥
Watched 1st set and went to sleep! I knew Carlos would break Tiafoe and then he did by two sets. Cant wait to see the Extended Highlights. I like how this became another 5 setter!
Alcaraz's reaction after winning this is just like when he reached the final at Miami earlier this year.
Tiafoe out
Genuine question as a non American. Why is it that when a black player is playing the TV cameras spend the whole match finding every single black person in the crowd to zoom in to. Do black people only support black players in the US?
This kid is the physical specimen. Very imressed 👏. Congrats.
Love their embrace after a fierce battle. Thank you BOTH players for such a majestic display of skill and grace!
Was that first point even real!!! 😱😱😱
Vamos Carlos!!! A por el 1!!!
Gladiator
Alcaraz disappointed whole crowd 🤐🤐
it’s already a known fact how skilled and powerful Alcaraz is. He’s definitely got GOAT potential. But what blows my mind even more is the fact his last few matches have been intense and laborious 5-setters, even having played a 5 hour & 15 minute game againts sinner just two days ago.   He played against Tiafoe with just the same power & level (maybe even more), like he wasn’t even worn out from his (intensive) past matches. Hoping he recovers well from this match enough to face Ruud. Vamos Carlos! 💪🏼
Alcaraz is such a disgusting boy! Showy and narcisstic!!!
Ill be so heartbroken if loses to Casper
Extended highlights plz🙏
Alcaraz vs rudd in a gs final.. Was long time come.. No kidding. 😆
better court coverage by  tiafoe could help him in the future.. but he played his heart out. I feel he was  sort of flaking in the end of the game and sort of  tired maybe?  as was  alcaraz....  for sure.   For sure for 100%  sure Tiafoe needs to move better in the court.. some of those  drop shots by alcaraz could be better contested.  Furthemore...  stop playing the ball to his  forehand.  We all know that is  his  fav... (alcaraz) and stronger  part!   anyways... better luck next time and Godspeed to Alcaraz. I hope you win the finals dude!! wowhoooo!!!  *applause*
Carlos will join the Mount Rushmore of tennis mark my words
como hicieron un resumen de 3 minutos con el partidazo que fue? era para  poner el partido completo
How did they make a 3-minute summary with the great game that was? it was to put the whole game
Tiafoe really gave it his all, but in the end, his strength understandingly wore out. But alcaraz, MAN, two five setters in 3 days, wow, he's just built different.
that first matchpoint saved was the best point of the match, just insane!
Alcaraz choked in set 4 match point. Against a better player that'd have cost him.
"Pandemonium inside Ashe"
Alcaraz beat Tiafoe AND the crowd. My mans goated.
Amazing Carlos ✨
Tiafoe was soaking wet from head to toe, Alcaraz could have played another set when that match ended , Spanish Tennis players have conditioning second to none he reminds me of a younger Nadal, congrats to Alcaraz really hope he gets this title, WHAT A BATTLE 💯
Seriously, what’s better final than two players fighting for their first grand slam title and No.1 ranking!! This is incredible!!
This kid just won 3 straight 5-set matches! He looks like Novak and Rafa combined. He's unstoppable and just only 19 years old, WOW!
Tiafoe played amazing despite falling short , the alcaraz and RUUD match has 5 sets written all over it 🔥💯 playing for World Number 1 and US open champion , I got alcaraz 3-2
الاسطوره القادمه كارلوس الكراز 😘
How many 5 setters can this kid play?! Gonna be one of the best title runs ever if he wins it.
Go Alcaraz!!! Win the whole thing!
It was generous of Alcaraz to let the crowd think Tiafoe may have a chance of winning.
Yes Carlos 🎉
Vamos Carlitos!
When we thought Alcaraz was finished playing epic 5 sets matches he delivered another  banger ⭐ Now it's final time whoever wins the match becomes the new nr.1 and if Alcaraz does he will be the youngest in history of the men's tennis. So much on the line for both 🔥
