❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Best speech ever.
F Scott Fitzgerald: "There are no second acts in American Life"  Jennifer Coolidge: "hold my Golden Globe "
Jennifer coolidge is so humble and  unique ❤
Love when real people who are not fake Hollywood phonies get recognition & a platform to be so genuine  ❤
She's the best thing on The White Lotus, even after her death. And, this is coming from a guy who absolutely loves Aimee Lou Wood's performance.
She so manic and insane but absolutely hilarious!
Watching her speak is like watching a beautiful train wreck. It's so chaotic, you're afraid to blink and miss something life changing. And when it's over you're not really sure what happened, you're so confused you don't know if anything is even real anymore.

UMMM THIS IS THE BEST SPEECH EVER!!!
Dreams do come true.
She’s so loved 🥰
As someone who just rewatched 2 Broke Girls… it’s crazy to me to hear her real voice.
Love u Jennifer and Mr. White❤
Brilliant. Long may she appear in everything!
my fav actress , want more and more oh her movies and shhow
the only thing i know this woman for is falling in love with a CGI villager after hitting them with her jeep grand Cherokee
Yeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhh
Honestly one of the greatest acceptance speeches ever. I love her
Actually that's despising beige dumb.
Love you, Jennifer🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
Can you imagine living next to Jennifer Coolidge on the same hill and not wanting to hang out with her constantly? Insane!
My neighbor is speaking to me now..  Ahahhahaha..
Gotta love her❤
i love her!
So much authenticity:) you know :) love her
Yeahy! You just want to sheer her on for forever.
Such an incredible actor. Hilarious to heartbreaking in a beat. And an amazing human being. So happy she's back in the spotlight ❤
She is so awesome ❤
The OG, Triple OG, OG Triple of MILFs.😂
I  miss Tanya - great Actress Madam Jennifer Coolidge!
What a superstar talent! So full of integrity and honest,some of the audience had those smirks ! She deserves a award for this acceptance speech alone , brava !
She got Nice azz tittays 😊
I am missing Tanya in Season 3!!
Love her!❤❤❤
Jennifer Coolidge might actually be the realest person in Hollywood no pre-read gazebo speech in the mirror beforehand probably knew she was going to get this award and still didn't care anyways. Her and jamie lee curtis are golden girls of hollywood❤
ADHD -I feel this.
For GOD so Loved the world that He Gave His One and Only Begotten Son JESUS CHRIST, so that anyone who Believes in Him will not perish but have Eternal Life (John 3:16)
Honestly, she is so funny and under appreciated. So happy she finally got her recognition. (Amazing in “Austenland”)
I don't know why I was laughing and crying at the same time!
Stifflers mom still got it going on
3:23 ....A man ...in a dress. Ridiculous.
The first season with Jennifer and Murray was so enjoyable and realistic, because both characters were people we can relate to. I’m also glad that Murray Bartlett was “allowed” to speak in his native Australian accent. Mike White is a common sense guy. Love all three series of The White Lotus and look forward to the fourth. ❤
Reverent.
I adore her. She makes me smile and laugh, and anything she gets is well deserved.
People  With  The  Initials  J  C  Just  Keep  Cropping  Up
Love JC❤️

She’s epic! It’s about time 🎉
2025 after the Minecraft movie 👇
<3
Awesome.
A room full of people who probably looked down on her career or skills and boom, Mike White finds the perfect thing for her, and she now has more emmys than 95% of that room. The people have always loved you, Jenn
She definitely deserve this award!
Gorgeous Lady great actress ❤
I love her sm
I love her.
Greatest speech ever😂
She really is a breath of fresh air in Hollywood.
So much coca-cola
A living proof that you don’t have to make it well-structured speech to express sincere meaning
How many times did she say Mike? Anybody kept a count 😂
I love her years before WL. She is incredible person and actress I literally saw all projects with her. Thanks God people see her now ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I really hope she didn’t die in the end of season 2, cause this character is very interesting and should appear in every season
❤❤❤
That’s a great Jennifer Coolidge impression 👌🏼
she can do a stand up show.....
😂😂😂😂THE WORLD LOVES HER 😂😂😂😂😂😂BRAVOOO🤗🤗🤗🥰🥰🥰
I'd watch anything with Jennifer. Need more of her!!!!!
Lol love HER. So genuine and so moving.
Just started loving this woman ❤
Just watched her character last swim in season two. Boy oh boy she is the centerpiece of the series! And the last farewell was just as beautiful as she deserved!!!!
She is so down to earth.   😊
She’s really like Tanya
She's hilarious. I love her. Sad her character was killed off.
She has a rich ppl vibe . She doesn’t need to finish her sentences!!
She deserves a million bend and snaps!
I had no idea she was so funny
Every one should have a Mike!
Genuine Sincerity as a person = Jennifer Coolidge
Mike's tears!! 😄Love to see it !! All of this!🥰🥰🥰
That's a super star. The amount of charisma she has can fill a whole room with Joy
Mike white should’ve won an Oscar for chuck and buck
Love her❤
love her 🥰
the close ups to mike r making me so uncomfortable I'm crying
Shes is hilarious . Adorable.
Totally love her!!!
As a millennial it blows my mind that she was only 37 years old in the first American Pie.
Well deserved 🎉 so happy for her.
I adore her! ❤
Im really just glad that i've seen the MIKE WHITE.
Is that Monica Vitti?
People who have experienced the ups and the downs are the ones who can truly appreciate the ups when they are back again.
she's THE BEST!
I love her authentic self.
Our modern day Mae West!
She is terrific
Love her, thank you Mike White. What an incredible show White Lotus is!
My god I love this woman so so much
And I thought my ADD was bad. I wish every acceptance speech at an award's show was this hilarious. I'd actually watch them.
Love her
she falls in love with a minecraft villager btw
I won’t more and more and More of Jenifer..cast her in everything she is hilariously funny beautiful talented she is just so hot right now..! lol so is the bomb she deserves success.
A DOLL'S DOLL!!! 😍😭
liar
AMAZING AMAZING HONEST ACTOR for ONCE!!! SO SO ADMIRABLE... After everything else, THE ZEST is ALWAYS THERE... Thank YOU Jennifer Coolidge for being a very TOUGH WOMAN! THANK YOU for MAKING US LAUGH! YOU ARE MY HERO!!!❤❤❤
I loved her in Austenland... and even more in the White Lotus. Congrats to you Jennifer❤❤❤❤
So Mike White gave her the script for Tanya and all it was written on the script was " be yourself " 😂
I’ve listened to this before, but I am now only “hearing” the part about Mike White worrying about people and friends not doing well and wanting them to live long and her not wanting to live long. It broke my heart. Pray, check on your people, and be kind.  🙏🏾🫶🏾
she makes my life better
She is honestly, so funny!
Love her character in "2 broke girls"
Where is Matt friend?? Smh
Just finished 2nd season white lotus. Oh Tanya.. Loved u in this season..
U could tell that everybody loves Jennifer.Shes hilarious when she talks.I love Jennifer!
She's the best! 😂❤
There is not a single negative comment in this thread, just love❤❤
Art
She's going to be facing RICO charges for paying Kid Rock to take me out for the illuminati Freemason Epstein Network and you're all gonna give back what you stole from me too
I love this woman!!!
"You make people want to live longer" is so offhand but one of the best compliments I've heard in my life, wow
She is wonderful. I wish I knew her.
She Is so Tanya....I love her 😊.
Jennifer Coolidge is well on her way to becoming the next Betty White.
It almost seems like a scene from a (hypothetical) film of hers, full of iconic lines that some of her (especially gay) fans would lovingly spoof on short YouTube parody videos, getting her mannerisms down to a T.
I teared up smiling laughing Jennifer you always are a joy in any movie I see you
The land of the free... and of puritanical and prudish censorship.
She’s needs to get on that slimming stuff quick.  Or a titanium gastric band.
AGAIN THEEEE BEST SPEEECH, FUNNY, HUMBLE, CRIED, LAUGHED AND EVEN THE ENDING WHEN SHE SAY. "Tis is one fun night" she sounden like cinderella winging an award. I LOVEEE HER!
L O V E   Jennifer Coolidge !
I love her! : DDDDD
Epic greatest golden globes speech of all time
Your so amazing and funny love ya
I think this was the most relatable speech I've ever seen 😂🥰 I didn't think I could love her more than I already did from Stiftlers mom, she's hilarious and loveable.
This is one of the most iconic speeches of all time.
I love her ❤ she deserves this
LOVE HER!!
This reminds me of Bill Murray's speech at the end of Scrooged 💗
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
I love her!!!!
I love you Jennifer🙃
This woman needs to host the Emmys, Golden Globes and OSCARS all in the same season!
Mike looks like a really nice guy
God, i love her since I first American pie!
She has no idea how loved she is. i am here from Brazil in Brazil with my swedish husband loving you Jennifer. 🇧🇷
I’m so glad she’s not all Hollywood but so glamorous at the same time. I hope she never becomes like them.
She’s amazing woman❤❤❤❤
Iconic
LOVE this female dog 🤣
She went up there and did her own thing and the speech was both iconic and memorable. Goes to show that there isn’t a written layout as to how to deliver the perfect speech that all those public speaking and speech writing master classes teach.
Im so happy people like her and niecy nash are getting their flowers really special talents.
She might have the smallest nose of all time for an adult female. Shes amazing im not body shaming im just randomly noticing.
Her flower is due. I have been watching her since high school. I am glad she got the recognition.
A true godess.
Love this and cried cos it's so heartfelt
I just clicked on the link to see what she's got to say this time because the very first time I saw the woman winning some award, her speech was hillarious, so I wanted to find if there's anything left on her mind, and she killed it again.
This is the most wonderful, unhinged, comedic, meaningful speeches ever!
Jennifer Cooledge such a great performar, From Seinfeld to 6 Feet Under with many others before 2 broke girls
I mean seriously… is there anyone better?
Haha 🤣 I love her
Shes given the right credit already. She deserves it
This is what it's like inside my ADHD brain. If you understood this entire speech : congrats, you are neurospicy! One of the realest people in Hollywood. What a vibe!
👑
1:04 Claire Danes was so confused 🤣
This is a REAL speech. I’m 28 now but nothing is more inspiring to me than those that spend DECADES in the industry then finally get the deserved accomplishment. The fact she basically said her passion fizzled out since it was so long, as we age it happens. That’s raw, and motivational how she followed up from that.
I love her.  I love.
This made me tear up. Even her speech is all over the place, but everything is from her heart. She's a true queen.
Literally the best woman in the world.  She deserves every accolade and to be queen.  Thank you Stifler’s mom.

YOUTUBE STOP CENSORING EVERYTHING!!! THIS IS OUR HUMAN LIVE!!!
Crying
3:22 disgusting pathetic loser !!
I love her, I love all her movies and tv shows, it just makes the show so better if she's part of the cast.
This was genuinely better than the oscar performances of most actors
Tyla told yall these awards are heavy ..mmm
I love her 💘
she goes on tangents all disorganized , I love  it and I love her , Soo real
The wall is real😂
"you make people want to live longer, and i didn't." that had no business being this powerful
*UNA DIOSA. Sin igual.*
stiflers mom.......yeeeeaaahhh.............BEST MILF EVER
She deserves it... I love her ❤❤😂
She is the best actress ever 🎉we so love her, my Sophie ❤
❤❤❤❤❤
Lazy Susan
I always love her acting.
She is a kind-hearted and genuine person.
Mickey rourkes future girlfriend
#punamkandulana
She's hilarious 🤣 especially when she said her neighbors didn't speak to her😂 we need more of her in movies
She is real...and very funny!
She is just so naturally hilarious and lovely, she should host the Golden Globles ! 😂
Utter chaos but so much fun! Well done to Jennifer Coolidge!
I love her
ALWAYS LOVED HER, If she was in it I was going to watch it 😊
She made me cried too, besides Mike White.
She fond of the rod they say.
This speech makes me cry every time. She is such a genuine and grateful person. I believe honesty is the ultimate weapon of mankind’s because of her❤ love her. Also I love her little roles!!!!
"I wanna thank all the evil gays."
The emotion in Mike White's eyes makes me cry. Congrats, girl!
Regina king looks like she’s mad she never won a dam thing
Jennifer C. Fckn icon. Love heeer❤
I ❤ the real people that make you feel something. Jennifer Coolidge is so authentic and passionate in a world of people who are mostly dead inside.
What an unatractive woman! I heard her stupid ad on  "I heart radio" and had to look her up to see who she was. OMG, what a looser.
Love her!
Lots of folks saying she's so genuine... but isn't the whole thing 'a bit'? Like I think Jennifer Coolidge *leans deep* into an ongoing 'bit'. Which makes her even more awesome, and hilarious, and talented... but it's a persona.  Long-haul commitment, and genuine skills ♡
WTF?! she is like this for real?? then why did she get this award???
Someone give her a grammy
I absolutely love Jennifer Coolidge .
If there was any Barbie movie sequel. You know she will fit right in
She just makes me cry tears of joy for absolutely no reason. I just adore her.
Absolute Queen of making speeches.
The OG Milf
∀-s๑⁄⁠(⁠⁄d ur a 💝.🛑🪦inG.✌️🐠mᕦ.thank'$ L ov๑ u\⁠(⁠๑♬. So please.🍩
🛑💔
Jennifer, you are an international treasure.
I swear, Jennifer Coolidge and Olivia Colman give the best award speeches. They're the best people!
Charisma 🤍
Anyone else come back to this video periodically when their dreams feel dead because it's super inspiring?
Could she be any more real, charming and loveable?
Even her non scripted, from the heart award show acceptance rants are hilarious! She truly is thee queen of comedy with heart.
I LOVE THIS BEAUTIFUL LADY SO SO WONDERFUL AND VERY FUNNY... MISS JENNIFER COOLIDGE,,,GOD BLESS YOU MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT FOREVER...
WE LOVE YOU STIFFLERS MOM!!!
Dude she talks like a gender bent Owen Wilson "wow"
This is one of the best speech I ever heard.
Rhea Seahorn was subbed. Just shows what a popularity contest this show is that they're choosing a comedic actress
Love that woman
Whatever they want! 🤣🤣🤣 She's golden! I love her 🤍💐
very likable woman she is.
I love her authenticity. The fact tho that she said no one on her hill invited her to any parties or even talked to her is so sad tho.
Im just focusing on brad pitt
You are amazing and cheerful and loved you are wonderful ❤❤❤
I Love Jennifer Coolidge she is so amazing and down to earth  and She is also Hilarious 😂. Beautiful too! She is my Avatar and those bohemian goddess clothes she wears in White Lotus are B E A U T I F U L. 😍
Matt Friend does a good impression  of her!
I Love her and remember back in Legally Blond ❤️👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
We should clone her while there is still time.
She is an icon. We all know her, even if you don't know why. :)
She is so deserving👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
She’s so awesome. Her character on the show is so exasperating but it’s just testament to her acting ability. Such well deserved recognition
This was great!
I love when you see them getting their reward for their hard work. The fact is she has been making us laugh for years . Gotta love her .
She's the best! 😂😂😂
"Five different sequels of American Pie..." Lol
I love this speech, so raw and authentic and quirky and how she praised Mike to make him cry was so sweet, She made some serious points about ageism in hollywood but she didnt do it in a "poor me" way
“You make people want to live longer, and I didn’t.” Damn, that hit me to my core. I have been there. I didn’t try to hurt myself, but there were days when I told God that it was ok to take me in my sleep. I’m glad she is doing better. It doesn’t matter if you’re royalty or my next door neighbor. No one should feel that way. I love her to pieces. ❤️
I love Jennifer Coolidge!
She is amazing
Love Jennifer she speaks from the heart.
Can she host SNL please?
She sounds and kind of looks like Chloe Webb from shameless.
watched this 10x now - I am still weeping and laughing like crazy. Man she deserved this long overdue
We do not deserve Jennifer Coolidge. Stand up in every way - humble, funny, witty, quick, and so much more. I keep coming back to this to watch over and over again. What a gem of a human being. We love you Jennifer!
3:21 wtf
and she got an standing ovation! That's a perfect speech right there! No need to prep, just HER and her heart! -👏👏👏👏👏👏 She's the neighbor/friend/second mom/grandma/mentor... everyone should dream of having!
She really does say “you know!” A lot… you know?! lol
One of the greatest, funniest, realist, trueist award acceptance speeches ever! They'll be playing this one forever, even at her funeral n in memorandum events! Hard to imagine she ever struggled after Broke Girls! That show was huge and oacked with comedy talent, and she was brilliant on it! She made herself into the third co-star fore on that show! She was comedy dynamite! Probably one of the best comic character performances of all time!❤😂😮
I wanna be BFFs with her. If only I knew she grew up in the town next to where I live now.
She is adorable! 🥰
iconic
3:21 What's up with that dude dressed like that? WTF?
I don't know who my hero is, Jennifer Coolidge or the guy who CACKLES after she asks, "I can put this down right?"
I love her ❤❤❤
Mike and Jennifer 2024
I always loved this lady.
It’s just Jennifer Coolidge playing herself in real life.  I didn’t want her character to end on the white lotus season 2.  She said she thought people would be sick of her and that’s just not true the world fell in love with Jennifer Coolidge.  I know I did. She is a huge big A List Star now.  But everything she plays in I have to watch since I first saw her in Legally Blonde 1& 2.  “You look like the 4 th of July and it makes me want a hot dog real bad”.   Omg I love her.  I heard her say she didn’t want to live longer that makes me sad but I get it. She is on a journey and now she is super famous.  Shane on those people who didn’t invite her to parties.  Bet she had her own parties now.   I wish the white lotus would not have killed her off.  I could watch 25 seasons of Jennifer Coolidge
❤😂
She’s hilarious! Love her! 😂😂😂
3:23 what the hell is that
She is a breath of fresh air.  Always funny, always loveable!
"Hey everybody!"
This is my Roman Empire
Love this women!!!!!! She is my childhood!!!!!
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF MERRILL STREEP, SHE'S RARE  RAW  EMOTIONS AND FEELINGS BURSTING OUT AND UNFILTERED.
MILF! MILF!  MILF!  Forever "Stiffler's Mom"!
Shes always been an icon in her own right ❤ congrats girl
Her persona is or seems to be a lot like the characters she portrays.
Love her!
she's hilarious LMAO she deserves everything!
That was a whole full standup routine in an acceptance speech. With all the self deprecation, authenticity and hilarity of one of the comedic greats. Love her.
She’s top rate! Mike White has to bring her back in WL3 (flashbacks?)!
What was censored at 2:41
She was spectacular on that show !
At this point i just think she's a really good actress and this is just a skit cuz she keep doing everytime she Won a reward. She's is brilliant.
I like her sooo much
Stifler's Mom RULES!!!
She will always be Stifler’s mom to me
I love her honesty and struggle to get her thoughts said correctly, I can feel her authenticity and it's so refreshing ❤️ absolutely loved first season pf the white lotus
Your life's prime is whenever you decide it to be
Nooooo I thought this was after Season 1 now I know she gets killed off in Season 2 omg 😭😭😭😭  Ugh, self spoiling, the worst kind if spoils. 😢
I just had to see this again because I just watched legally blonde for the first time in ages
I think it's time for her to retire  2 big reasons why she is still acting  1 she's sleeping with either directors or producers  2 she just playing more goofy roles than most actresses
She is so authentic , love her she is such a sweetheart
All I see and hear now is just Sophie Kachinski from 2 Broke Girls
She's an absolute gem.
WHO DARE NOT INVITE JENNIFER COOLIDGE TO A PARTY!!!!
Would of loved to see her in barbie as a dolphin 🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️❤️
I love her!!!!!
Hilarious hilarious hilarious!!!!!!!!
Thank you Mike White for bringing back jennifer coolidge and also for writing School of Rock
She is hilarious. I just want to hug her and squeeze her.
Absolutely amazing!!!👏❤😂😊
The “you make people wanna live longer” instantly made me cry after I’ve been laughing the whole time
shes so funny, and I hope she’s really rich cause she deserves so much
Stifler's mom!
STIFLER'S MOMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Mike white, wherever you are, there is a middle age woman chanting your name. LETS GOO
I saw Jen and Mike White in Syndey at a sit down conversation at the ICC on saturday. She is so phenomenal. Completely humble, gorgeous, and funny. Mike White is also glorious. Those two make an amazing team. PLEASE MIKE WHITE, LET JEN RETURN FOR SEASON 3 IN WHITE LOTUS.!!!
This is a gay icon :)
Mike White please do a prequel ep where we see Tanya at another White Lotus, I'm not ready to say goodbye!!
T'was like a stand-up, so lively!
Jennifer we love you!!!
The original MILF
I'm sorry  I  am sure she is a nice person  but I have seen her in guest roles and also sitcoms and movies but I just don't  think  she is funny. I know everyone  has a different  sense  of humor  but I  don't  think she is funny.
She is so truly unique, quirky, geniune, overkill and just amazing 👏
Awww, Mike White’s face when she mentions him and thanks him, he is one of the only people I truly want to meet from Hollywood. He really is a nice dude and him and Jack Black made an amazing team in School of Rock.
I've never been more happy than Jennifer getting ALL the recognition she deserves.
Love this speech. Whenever I'm down I just watch it to warm my heart
i love you jeeeen
Oh, I love her 😂❤!
JC 🔥🔥🔥... absolutely love her in the closer
I'm sorry but I was a bit surprised at Claire Danes
Cool... I wish I could have heard the curse words though... 😆😆😆😆👍
Queen
The White Lotus without her ? No way ! Like a ghost, a resurrected, a hidden sister, a clone but please : MAKE HER COME BACK ! She is so special ! The White Lotus without her... it will become a real sad Lotus ! Bring her back here !
God i love her so much, shes such an unappreciated actress, especially with her delivery with basic lines that literally are so inconic because it was HER! We LOVE and appreciate you and finally glad yourr getting the recognition you deserve, my love!!!
I remember her from a seinfeld episode. She was Jerrys girlfriend and a messeur. She wouldnt massage Jerry and that was fun episode.
She's such an inspiration for me
“You make people want to live longer, and I didn’t.” To drop that right at the end, in what was very obviously a stream-of-consciousness speech, is both heartbreaking and moving. I hope she gets far more time in the spotlight, she more than deserves it.
Go girl!!!!
I love her so much
Her authenticity is so beautiful and touching it makes me cry
Whenever I have dry eyes, I watch this.
I love this woman.
I love how she makes u cry and laugh at the same time she is so hilarious
👏👏👏👏
I just love her!  She was brilliant in the White Lotus!!!!!!!!!!
Probably my favorite speech ever!!! SE MERECE TODO
Who won’t invite Jen Coolidge for party. She is a blast
All the stars were in awe of the real superstar.
If you know, you know...
Jennifer can put a smile on anyone's face. Not everyone can do that. She's someone u wanna chill with all day 😊🍹
“My neighbors are speaking to me” 😂 GOALS
NGL I found her over the top & annoying in legally blonde etc but she absolutely killed it in white lotus. This is award is so deserved. Also does everyone realise she didn’t haven’t her big break until she was nearly 40 (American Pie)!!!
what a great speecjh. Honest, genuine and so real.
I absolutely love her, she must be protected at all costs.
Michelle yeoh, Brendan Fraser, Jennifer Coolidge.   So good to see deserving actors FINALLY getting their recognition!
I just love Brad Pitt's reaction. He seems to be the only one genuinely smiling and tickled by the awkardness and authenticity of this.
Jennifer is one of the most beautiful ppl.  She is so sweet & humble.
I just love her❤❤❤
“He is worried about his friends who aren’t doing so well” is possibly the nicest thing you can say about a person.  Mike White must be a really good person.
I have tremendous love and respect for Jennifer Coolidge. God bless her. So authentic!!! One thing I miss in this age of filters.
She is a gem...such a fun person and genuine speech; you can tell it comes from a place of genuine struggle, growth, power, gratitude 🙏  Mike White really felt that...every word she said, it meant so much for him🥲
I am so happy for her , I always liked her even in small roles she was amazing.
"Thank god for the model trains. You know, if they didn't have the model train they wouldn't have gotten the idea for the big trains..." Delivered so perfectly we're hardly aware this is a script, written by screenwriters, and spoken by an actor in front of a camera. Maybe some people think it's easy to sound like an idiot if you really are an idiot, but I'd like to see some of those people try to do this, bring a character to life so we are able to forget the person is just a construct and this is not who the actor really is. Thank you, Jennifer Coolidge, for making so many films so much more fun to watch. I wish I could say never for a moment did I believe you were so dense. But anyway, it's all your fault for being so convincing!
This woman brings us joy and not a single person wanted her to stop rambling. 💗 😆
Huh good thing I watched this speech AFTER seeing the show😅
Jennifer Coolidge is a national treasure.... Who's with me?!?!
Love her personality so much she is a queen and gold❤❤❤❤
Love this actor. She has grit. And wow is she ever thankful for how she got there and who helped her. She’s in season 1 and 2 of White Lotus.
I just love this woman. So humble <3
Whenever I'm feeling out of sorts, I watch this. JC just makes my day.🤣💃❤️
This is more than a comeback for her, this is the peak of her acting career (so far...). Critically acclaimed performance in a huge HBO show, winning Emmy and a Golden Globe. Goes to show we all have different journeys and achieve things at different ages. She's hilarious & so talented, I hope there are some great roles for her in the future - let's go for that Oscar!!
0:19 even Bard enjoyed it! Love it
How could their neighbors never invite her before to their parties is beyond my comprehension 😮❤👏👏
"It was just you Ryan" and "My neighbors are speaking to me" have got to be the funniest parts of her speech 😂 and to think it all just comes out of her mouth so spontaneously, man that speaks volumes about her ability to entertain people! What a fun human being! Also, extremely intelligent - her vaudeville reference!
So humble!! I love her so much!
She is my favorite love her
Y'all need to check all her characters out, the show Two Broke Girls really was outstanding. She's in that!
“You make people want to live more and i didnt “ People took it as a joke but she was being real …. She meant everything people didnt talk to her she didnt know many famous people she always had small roles and im sure she went through a huge depression where it was exactly that “ did not want live” and im so happy she is enjoying this success. May the best of vibes, and energies and opportunities be with her. She deserves all the blessings God can send.
STOP the YOU KNOW! STOP IT ! NO MORE "YOU KNOW"s   Sign the petition! ---------------------------

Coolidge proves how much she deserves this. This is the warmest, sincerest and most inspiring acceptance speech I've heard. Tearing up now.
She's amazing. She always makes me laugh, and she is kind of vulnerable and strong at the same time. Love that. Happy for her!
People like her are not common. Genuine, funny, sweet!
she is natural comedian.
I love her.  She is always so quirky, and hilarious.
where's the non-censored version?
The best golden globe speech is secured ❤
😅Laughed my socks off
She’s fun to watch!
I'm sorry but you can rehearse your speeches and use all sorts of fancy words but nothing beats this pure from the heart unfiltered, hilarious, relatable, brilliant speech
The White Lotus is such a great show
Did she get this emmy for her role in the white lotus?
Absolutely love her
Love u jennifer ❤
She's fantastic and funny! Can't believe although, America still beeps out certain words at 2022...
What a beautiful tribute!
She should have been the host
3:33 You make people want to live longer, and I didn't"  ....shiza
She is the best ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

I ADORE HER.
She’s hilarious, adorable, genuine, humble, well deserving and truly talented. I hope we all are graced with more of her acting talents on the big and small screen.
Well… she is a Queen! She got that right!!! She did it!
Now I can see why she was mostly in comedies 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 she’s natural funny and captivating.
I believe we found next year's host, right?
Это была действительно искренняя речь. Я так рада за Дженифер Кулидж, мне она всегда нравилась, она особенная
WHY DID I CRY??? God I love her ❤❤❤❤🧡🧡💕💕
She is speaking from the heart where you don't get in Hollywood.  A lot of these actors should know about down times in there career where no one wants you and you are barely keeping it together financially and emotional.  She got the opportunity and is taking advantage of it.  Cheers to Jennifer!  By the way, loved her in Best in Show.
I'm so glad that the general public is now appreciating Jennifer Coolidge and lauding her with the same love the gays have for the last 2 decades.  These gays are trying to [idolise me]!!!
love her so much
Omg I freaking love this woman and she us just as she us in her acting! 🤣😂🤣
She's the best
Jennifer's speak was great. Delighted for her. 👏👏👏
SAG next!
2:55 I can't 😭
SHE JUST SPOILED WHITE LOTUS SEASON 2 FOR ME 😭😭😭😭
I absolutely adore her. She's so amazing.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
She Just ran a 5min stand up 😂
SHE IS MY FAVORITE ACTRESS!!!  I LOVE HER!!! ❤️
Only one love her.please can we see MORE OF HER. 🕊🇺🇲💕
💕
I'm trying to learn English but I realize that this woman makes the language more difficult to uderstand.
I love her completely but i just have to throwback…I couldn’t be more proud of ‘Stiflers Mom’ she deserves all this and more-she was so iconic and perfect in that role. I love that that splash was her beginning.
I've watched this 4 times already!
I think she's the most real person in Hollywood. There is no BS she's just herself.
I love her ❤
So real and authentic.  A breath of fresh air.
Jenifer is a great actor with an amazing talent to make me laugh and feel happy.   She’s a wonderful woman and a wish her the best!!!  Greetings from Buenos Aires, Argentina
제니퍼 정말 잘 되서. 고마워 ❤❤❤ 앞으로 꽃길만 걸어여!!
She's so funny and pure. She has moved into that space that Betty White left empty when she passed away. She's just a treasure.
This is hands down the best acceptance speech I have ever seen. I have watched it a thousand times now and it makes me laugh and cry every time. She is so ridiculously talented, I can't believe that her parts have always been small and supportive. Hopefully soon she will get a leading role. She is up there with Olivia Coleman and Helen Mirren in my book.
I love it when someone from Hollywood has a moment when they seem like a real person.
Mike got quite emotional. I think he appreciated those lovely words out loud to the audience. She’s gold👍.
We need Tanya Mcquoid own show!!!!
Me encanta Jennifer Coolidge, adoro mucho como se le ha estado reconociendo últimamente, ya era hora! ❤️
Anyones thinking her comedy is unintentional that’s not true. She has excellent unique timing. She practiced this speech in front of a mirror gazillion times and there’s zero wrong with that. Artists like her who has seen such highs and lows work the hardest
Jennifer as wicked Stepmother in Hillary Duff's A Cinderella Story is forever ingrained into my memory.
I’m not gonna lie, i bursted laughing when she said “well it was just you Ryan” 😂😂
So heartfelt. That's why it will be one of the most iconic acceptance speeches.
I love her. But also, is she even acting when she plays Tanya? Regardless she's great.
Sophie's the best!
Damn she spoiled S2 for me! It was worth it though. This speech was amazing, and now I get why people love her.
I’ve watched this over and over and just now noticing that Mike White is sobbing🥹🥹 I love her and everything about this speech
A true gem in Hollywood! Glad she's getting the attention she deserves
Love her
❤❤
She is absolutely hilarious in her spontaneous, natural, raw sense of humor.  They don't come like this anymore, she is a gem!
I’m in tears happy and historically laughing I just love JC ❤😂
She's lovely person.
Noe THAT was a reality show!!
Best speach ever!!!!
How can you not fall in love with this woman? Jennifer Coolidge fan for life!
She was in a Friends episode right?
love her!!!!!!
she is so talented ❤
Somebody gonna make a "You know" song about this 😂😂😂
I love this woman!! She’s my idol ❤️❤️❤️
Dattebayo
This woman is sooooooo sweet and good heart!!
3:22 omfg
omfg, claire danes looks older than her
I keep coming back to watch this and her Emmy speech/dance..Can't get enough
should say spoiler in the title ! like this to get it to the top !!! just showed this to my girlfriend as we think jennifer is fantastic and then she spoilt it and now my girlfriend hates me… help !!!
who is that 3:22 ?
I'll never forget her in Legally Blond
She straight up steals every scene she's in in White Lotus.
she’s precious.
😢😢😢😢😢so so sad😢😢
I've been Jenn's makeup artist over several years when she was doing the damn comedy circuit. I am so happy for her career renaissance. She's a DELIGHTFUL human being... and as funny in person as you would imagine.
I NEED A SOLO MOVIE FOR HER!!! 😍❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful Jennifer I have to see her new movie
I freakin love her. She will always be my favorite milf.
👏👏👏👏
I have a feeling she's gonna be cast in many movies and tv shows going forward and I'll be watching every one of em . Absolutely Love her . I want to go out to the pub with her .
That beautiful moment when she didn’t make the speech about her, but about those who believe in her…. Brava!!
The ‘00s was a decade with stereotypes of “dummy” sexy blonde women in movies. And now after 20 years it’s so fresh and nice to watch her character (still sexy blond aged woman) but full of personality, some fears, some desires.
3:22 WT-actual-F am I looking at here?!? 😮
Jennifer Coolidge is an absolute legend!
I think i have watched this speech 100 times. Who is with me?
Jennifer is awesome.  She's been a fantastic addition to the cast of every production w/which she's been a part.  She's got it all; the looks, the hair, the face & the personality that makes us all fall in love with her character in every production of which she's a part.
What was bleeped out?
I simply love her... 💪
Usually I hate it when winners have long speeches but with her I don’t mind she’s like a really talkative friend that you really love. She has no fake bone in her body. She’s the realest.
People didn’t know how to handle her speech
Stifler's Mom - GENIUS!!! From the very first moment I saw her in that role, I knew - she's SUBLIME, EXQUISITE and CAPTURING!!! In every way a person can be!!!❤️⭐👑 It's actually so suiting that there's a "cool" in her name - SHE IS THE COOLEST!
So happy for Jennifer I hope we can see more of her
And now I love mike white because she loves him that much
Iconic
What a beautiful soul.
To see Brad Pitt ENTHRALLED with her in the front. Get it girl 😍
She’s so chaotic i love her
stifler's mom is still hot
“i want to see what you said written on paper” 😂❤
Love her
And I didn't think she could top her emmy acceptance speech.
This made me really love her
pamela andersson and jennifer coolidge !!!!
I happy for Jennifer that some of her dreams are coming true. She's so adorable and likeable and funny.   I'm glad she called out all the people who wiped her in the past but now invite her to parties. Calling out the Shallow Ones.
most of the male audience is pissed off listening to her.
Why would anyone not invite Jcool to parties. I would invite her everytime and get her a bit tipsy.
Iconic
Mike white. Going by Jennifers opinion  , and by the tears pouring from his eyes  . Be Seems to be a a truly glorious human being.   So thanks from us to Mike. 💜🙏🌻.
I didn't watch white lotus but she deserves it very much
I love this woman.
I love Mike White
She killed the careers of most of the stand up comedians in the world with a acceptance speech under 5 minutes..that too without the intention of being funny or script. That's Jennifer for you! ✨
Everyone needs a “Mike White" once in life….
LMFAO!!! Are they serious?
So happy fire her😂
I love her a "real" person in Hollywood.  I binged on both series of White Lotus.  All because of her character!  Her speech made me cry.  Love her give her more parts!!
Og mama!
3:01
I love her as much as Dolly 😂😂😂 she’s great
I C O N I C !
I love I love and I love Jennifer Coolidge ❤️ ❤️🇧🇷
The way she is so genuine, and flustered and honest...it's hard no to love her.
I started to tear up as I watched Mike White start to become emotional.  Who doesn't want something nice said about you to the entire globe.
I love her. She’s so honest and not pretentious.
Scene-stealing talent, what a wonderful Woman and actress.
I love her so much. ❤❤❤
why am I crying?
Overhyped, she has been acting the same way for the last 20 years, whether the character is mean, nice, or deluded, it is the same ditzy person. After 3 episodes in season 1 I had to stop watching the show as it was so weird.
This is the most genuine Hollywood  award speech I've heard.
She is so AWESOME and FUNNY. I hope they find a way to bring her back on WL!!
To try and describe such a wondrous human being reveals the rank inadequacy of language ❤❤❤❤
Love her so much! Hope to see her in more from now, more awards to come!
I was so sick of seeing one and the same faces all the time. She is like a fresh breeze.  I'm happy that movie industry gave her another chance to shine.
You know?
I'll always remember Mike White from School of Rock. Good to see he's still around.
What a legend.
What a trip of a speech!😁
What an iconic queen. She deserves the world 2x
Hope... Acknowledgment... Gratitude.... Passion and love.... that's Jennifer Coolidge. Awesome.
i think her speech is for all struggling actresses and actors having a hope to make it in their dreams.. love ❤️ ms jennifer coolidge
An utter queen! Command that stage!
💚
Give her all the roles you can give her Hollywood!
she really is tanya!! lol. love her
I think Jennifer would even be loved  and off limits to Ricky gervais if he hosted.  Love it!!    Such a likable and relatable person!!  Gonna have to watch white lotus now
Mike white should’ve won the Academy Award for Best Actor in Chuck and Buck
Please everybody who isn't aware, don't miss her roles in Christopher Guest films like Best in Show. They're fabulous and it seems many aren't aware sadly.
I just love her!  ❤
Quentin tarantino always pokerfaced. Does this dude ever laugh? 😅
She is CHAOS and I am here for it.
She is soooo fun to watch!!!
my spirit animal, my spirit family the one and only Jennifer coolidge
She behaves just like her characters. And she plays the same character in every movie or series she is in but I like her anyway.
She IS Tanya. ❤
She is everything you imagined her to be !!   So real so honest and so so appreciative.    Her and Dolly are the people you wanna watch when the world gets too much.   Thank you Jennifer ❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😘
How deserving!! ❤
Why do I have this feeling that SNL will ruin this speech🤭😭😂😂😂... The Mike guy getting ready for those tears 😂 I love this!
The funniest speech!!!
Jennifer Coolidge, Brendan Fraser, Ke Huy Quan, it’s been the year of the comeback and not in the Kim kardashian way
SHE IS T H E B E S T. I've only recently discovered her absolute brilliance <3
So happy for our Jennifer she’s been killin it for years ❤❤❤
she is really special!!
I love her. I love her work and would like to see more of her.
❤❤❤❤
OMG what a wonderful woman... and Mike White. You guys are the best.
What a fantastic speech. This is why Golden Globes are the best. Not like those trash Oscars.
I haved her since Legally Blonde. I am so happy for her 😍❤️.
She is unique! A truly queen!
She really does speak like that and is so naturally funny 😂😂😂 I love her
I had a really bad day today, so I watched this to feel happy. It reassured my faith in humanity
Jennifer RULES forever! Bless her talented & funny self. 💪👍👍
She’s a Queen 👸
Nooooooo I’m only halfway through S2 of The White Lotus and she spoiled it for me 😢 happy for my Queen though x
omg i love her so much, she is the best!!
she should be hosting the Golden globes!
I love her. ♥️♥️
To make a person laugh and cry in the same breath! Pure Magic!!!
I'm genuinely happy for her and Brendan Fraser. Glad destiny smiled at them again. 🥰🥰🥰
"u make people want to live longer, and i didnt"  woah, if that isnt the best compliment u could ever get.
I love this acceptance speech! It’s pure love and gold! You are a Star Jennifer! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I cant belive that she came so far from being Stiflers mum
I want her to play live action miss piggy so bad 🤣🤣🤣
This speech has to get an award!
The way Brad Pitt looked at her with delight. She’s actually probably age appropriate. What a cute couple they’d be!
Adorable and she is stunningly beautiful. Like Faye Dunaway. Well done stylist
You know??😂 we know!! And we love you!!!!!❤❤❤❤
3:30 My heart 😭
I LOVE that they let her keep going 🤣❤️  They didn't just cut her off.
Absolutely hilarious. This one's a keeper.
Who was that tall redhead handing out the award on the background?
Colin Farrell, Brendan Frasier, Ke Huy Quan.. and now Jennifer Coolidge… Finally brilliance is recognized after all this time.. James Hong needs that lifetime Oscar Achievement.
Goddess.. she makes me want me be a actress
Omg I love her
White Lotus is quite a bizarre comedic tragedy with no definable plot line to speak of but like all good train-wrecks, you keep watching.  And her character was outstandingly good.  Her and the hotel manager carried the show.
a lot of the faces in the audience are unable to recieve her genuine energy, probably because they lack authenticity themselves. The shot of Claire danes was really telling. We love you Jennifer ❤️
The star who never knew she was one of the brightest
This may be one of the MOST authentic. acceptance speeches I've ever heard!
Ya gotta love her! She’s become a comedy genius.
Mike White. I now love you, too!!!  Omg. What a speech. She’s a national treasure!!!!
Pause at 4:02 - like WOW imagine if the world looked at you like that. This woman makes the world glow. How could you freaking kill Tanya off!?!? She was the AHS Jessica Lange of white lotus. She better wake up in that body bag in season 3 lmaooo.
Goddamn, I envy everyone that has come in contact with her. She really deserves more and one of the people that i would be completely honored to be in the presence of. ❤
Bravo! At last Fat and Stupid is a thing. Lovin’ it!
We don’t deserve Jennifer Coolidge
I've loved her since she was eating popcorn and waiting for a message . . . from herself.
MY KIND OF PEOPLE. LOVEEEE HER!!!!!!! SOMEBODY GET THIS WOMAN A NETFLIX DEAL, WOULD YOU???
What was bleeped? Does anyone know?
MILF
GOD I LOVE THIS WOMAN SHE IS THE MOST ADORABLE ICON EVER SHE CANNOT DIE
There is no pretense with her. I love it. She is cute & funny.
You make people want to live longer. Honey it doesn't get better than that. What a lovely thing to say.
i LUV her sooo much! Proof if you have the power to make your dreams come true- even if it takes a while ^.^
i LUV her sooo much! Proof if you have the power to make your dreams come true- even if it takes a while ^.^
She was great in two broke girls tv show
Congrats Stiflers mom 🙂🙏🏾
Wow she is so real its breathtaking.  I she’d some tears, you could tell she was speaking from her heart.
Her gratitude is so contagious.
She is way - way - way  too cool for that audience! So many of them are carrying "me mirrors" -  look so stuck up and full of themselves -  and could never be as vulnerable and real and funny and humble as she is. That's the kind of friend you need in your life.
I have a BFF named Mike White.. She is great..
Lol they tried to play Michelle off quick and not her wonder why
She is so sweet and more beautiful than ever 💕 I love her
The part that made me cried was when she was thinking Mike and said he made her want to live longer and when she said cuz I didn't.. that's like a major transition to not want to live
Stiflers mom with the dub 🤙🏽
Loved her as Bonnie in The Cool Kids!
Breathe, take a percaset and go on stage!
I could listen to her all day and night. ❤️
Every time I have a bad or stressful day, I rewatch this. It still makes me laugh every time I watch it
Love her so much! She has one of the best voices. 💛 Put her with Tress MacNeille and the voices would just make the movie/show the best thing ever! 😄
I thought she was Lisa Lampanelli
Ugh!!! He never should have killed her off, she made that show!!!❤️
She is amazing!
She is the BEST!!!
Why is this giving me Trisha Paytas vibes ? 😂
cant believe they attempted to play this legend off the stage- hands down best speech of the night
The greatest thing about her is that she’s funny just by being herself
Nailed it!!!
Does anyone know what words she said that were bleeped out?
Her emotions and mind is swimming with happiness. A GREAT speech!👏👏💕👏👏
I've always loved this woman. She's adorable.
Ugh I love her so much.
i love her
Iconic. Fabulous. Legend.
That entire speech was giving looney bin but in the most refreshing and hilarious way
In my 20s I worked in a bougie stationery/gift store in LA and met many stars, Jennifer Coolidge included. She was the most considerate, real, humble and interesting person I met there. She once offered to take me across the street for a coffee, she complimented me, always tipped (for gift wrapping) generously, and was just so down-to-earth. I told her I was a fan, especially of Best In Show. She said it was the most fun movie to film. I am so happy for her, she deserves all the accolades she’s getting! My hubby and I just binged both seasons of White Lotus and she is awesome; so so funny! Go Jennifer!!!
“ Best in show “she was flipping amazing !!
Speech about her and she made it about others. Humility at its finest
I love this so much 🥹
So AUTHENTIC love her
She still bright looking young give her the light.
She deserve it.
Man she’s a real one.
She was great in Single all the Way.
I fuckin lovvvvvve herrrrrrr. This is well deserved!
She calls them little roles but i remember every single one. Jennifer Coolidge is one of the most underrated and under credited comediennes of our time and im so glad shes finally seeing that too and getting properly recognized!
These are the kind of speeches that make people wanna watch award shows. How refreshing
Love love love her
Mike White my favorite survivor player! ❤ thank you for reviving this woman’s career 😢
Jennifer Coolidge, what an amazing Lady.
Adore her 🎉
This woman is a legend. Thank you Jennifer for being you and giving this cruel world something to look forward to. A timeless beauty. A timeless talent. A timeless human.
Shes so funny
Yassssssssss
She made quite an impression in Legally Bond.
STIFLER'S MOM
This was the best award speech in history!!! It was from her heart and I love Jennifer❤❤❤❤❤
I would totally invite her a party!  Hello????
I've always enjoyed Jennifer Coolidge even in the smallest of parts. She carried them big! Congrats and you deserve it.
This lady is absolutely a natural born comedian...thanks Mike White, what ever yiu did. Cheers Jennifer from your LOVING PUBLIC 👌👏👏👏
For once everyone was right. Her speech was glorious. ❤
sweet as pie! I have got to see white lotus!
I love her!!! dana t.
We love her, we want see more from her, she is underrrated idk why. Jenniffer you are in the heart of people.
She can't for a moment be disingenuous.  Pure delight .
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-9yNVGiOpE
She just keeps getting better and better with age.  Always loved her!
She deserved it..Get it girl 🥳🥳🥳🥳Stifler's Mom has come a long way
While she was  putting the award on the floor I was muttering "say it, say it, bend and SNAP!"
She’s perfect.
Just give her a show of her own.....! It will be an instant hit. Her life experience stories alone will fuel it for decades. Good on ya Jennifer! We love ya!!!
I want to meet her. She's so genuine 💗
ICONIC
Enthusiasm plus ignorance equals success
What did she win the award for?
All I know is that somewhere in that control booth, a gay producer yelled “hold!” at least 10 times during that speech. They knew what the people wanted. 😂
i wanna smoke a blunt  with her
This video should have ** SPOILER ALERT ** in the title!
LOVE her!!! SO glad for her moment at last...WELL DESERVED at long last. Can't stop rewatching TWL Season 2!!
“ I don’t work out, you know what I mean, I can’t hold it that long”……. most celebrity  ever!!
Best speech 😅
She made an impact to us fans, it’s because of Hollywoods dumb standards putting beautiful but untalented actresses in movies that make us feel empty after watching a movie, I like great acting and don’t mind beautiful people I just think it’s secondary.
I just love her from The moment I saw her on legally blonde!
Yessss! I've loved her from the first moment I saw her. I'm so glad she's getting the recognition she deserves. She's a national treasure!
Not to be that girl, but who’s the guy before Andrew Garfield ?
She talked about all the people who uplifted and supported her, she didn’t make it about HER the whole time. I appreciate that Jennifer you a real one.
What are the Golden Globes?
Ned Shneebly?
So glad she and White Lotus are doing so well. Superb ❤
I love this broad 😂
Happy tears. Iconic woman!
Seeing her success brings me joy! She's earned it, and stayed real!!!
I absolutely love her 🏆
I truly did not think I could love this woman more but I think my love for her will expand for all of time. She’s just so relatable, funny and kind ❤
She said everything needs to be said to honor peace” everywhere the way “stansfield” shouted EVERYWHERE!
I've watched this ten times already 😂 I can't get enough of her and I'm glad they let her talk because she did get cut off last time too fast!
DAYUUUMM! Stifflers mom is still hot 😂😂
Golden globes is SHADY!!   Jennifer Coolidge gets 4mins of speech time without interruption while michelle yeoh only get 2mins then the music booting her out. I’m glad Michelle said SHUT UP! To the pianist   Congrats to Jennifer Coolidge! Love u in white lotus!
They just let her keep going, because everyone wants to hear her speak lol
Im obsessed !! This is the greatest fxcking speech of all time!!!! Lmaoooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was so wholesome how the episode ended and then seeing the restaurant was closed was like someone threw me a bucket of cold water
I love Jennifer Coolidge
She is too loquacious!
I could literally watch Jennifer Coolidge make rambling speeches all day long, she is just hilarious and so genuine. You can tell by how unstructured she is that she did not expect the win and it’s about time she got the spotlight! Love her!
LOL who cares ZzzZzz
👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣😪😪🤣🤣😀🤣🤣 Love her so much !
Omg love her 😍 ❤ 💕  coming straight out of Ma and putting us on the map
Jennifer Coolidge, YOU ARE CLASS ITSELF!!!! LOOOOOVE YOU!!!!!
She’s so awesome
I feel like this whole speech should be my new ring tone
American. Treasure.
I wish Jennifer Coolidge would get into stand up comedy. She’s just naturally so funny! And this was also so sweet to see her get recognition finally as well as see her recognize those around her.
I love her!!!
I wish she'd host the Oscars. Sure, the show would be a 6 hours long, but it'd be a hilarious, stream of consciousness.
LOVE HER
She is overdue for SNL or her own show she makes EVERYONE laugh.
This is the edited version…. The full version is even more heartfelt and real. ❤ The world is a dark place for many people… thank you Jennifer for sharing your story and giving some of us hope.❤
She is a jewel
Can she be cloned and one of them put in cryosleep for future generations to witness her glory?
She plays gross old white lady pretty well.   But isn't that who she is ?
Jennifer Coolidge is a lot like Brendan Fraser. I think they both thought their careers were over but the fans always stuck with both of them. I think it goes a long way with show creators and casting directors. Helps them remember or see just how talented they are. Nice to see her get her flowers
God please don’t let her go away after this i need more of her forever
Love!
The ending was so sad in the 2nd season. I was hoping she'd triumph against the bad guys instead of dying. She honestly was super funny and relatable in the show as a woman who's awkward and thus deemed as unattractive because of it.
That is the best acceptance speech I've ever seen. She's fabulous.
Great speech. Sincerity is messy, not packaged in a snappy trite couple lines. Love her.
Every time I see Jennifer Coolidge, she always brings a smile to my face ☺️,  even as the crazy lunatic real estate agent from The Watcher (I think that's the name of the series.) I love her. She's funny, spunky, and definitely a sexy hot MILF. May her career continue to blossom. Muah!!! 😘
❤😂
Stifler’s mom, I can watch her all day😂
Ridiculous 💩
Who doesn’t love Ms Coolidge — Mike White wrote White Lotus with Jennifer in mind …. It’s too bad that more show runners/writers don’t do this — it pays off.  Jennifer is such a under appreciated gem and deserves to be utilized.
Love Her!!!!
Mike White is lovely - his show Enlightened was unbelievably beautiful and I’m so glad he’s getting the recognition he deserves with this.
How could you not love this lady? ❤🇬🇧
It makes me want a hotdog real bad!
I’ve been compared to her by a couple people I’ll love forever. I’m thick with a young voice, I’m brutally honest, and I always say just whatever is on my mind at any given time. I don’t understand meanness and I always have something funny to say. I’m highly misunderstood and disliked by a lot of people, just like Jennifer. Seeing her FINALLY loved the way she is now (opposed to everyone saying how annoying she is) makes me feel times are changing in my favor, too. Bravo, JC!
Our next Golden Globes host 👏
She is herself in everything. I love her 🥰
Beautiful and funny, what more could you ask for???? in a very talented actress. A role model for hanging in there and nailing it!!! Thank you Jennifer you make TV and movies fun to watch!
I absolutely love Jennifer Coolidge, she is absolutely fabulous. I love she is having her moment!
She slays. Everything she says is both real and dead hilarious. Imagine what it's like to hear this in person, live. What a genius.
Shes a f-n winner!!
My neighbors are talking to me now. 🤣🤣🤣
Mike white was toasted lol
Snl call her
I just love her!!!!!
😍💯🏆👏💐 #bestspeech #jennifercoolidge #mikewhite #whitelotus
Really enjoyed her White Lotus role and think she's great but also wish she hadn't spoiled the big Season 2 finale in her speech before I got to see it 😢
Stiffler‘s mom got it going on proud of her
I so love that she said that Mike White cares about people AND animals. Animals get left out of the equation of those who need help 99% of the time when people say « we should be helping… » And Mike White is vegan standing up against slaughterhouses and all the sadism that goes on on animal  farms behind closed doors.
I loved this, she said nothing and everything 💗
I want to be friends with her so bad! She’s so relatable, funny, AHS down to earth! Congrats to her well deserved! 👏🏽
She is amazing.
So happy for her. She really has killed it in every single one of her 'little jobs' over the years. Just kind of shows up and breaths life into the thing, then she's off again. Also Mike White. Ever since that HBO show Enlightenment you could see he was a special talent with a big heart. Should see it if you haven't. A nice break from the more sensationalist show. Very grounded and high-minded at the same time. Rarely this happy for two people in Hollywood.
One of those small parts was on the amazing series NIP/TUCK.  she was hilarious and that’s where I first saw her and have been a fan since ❤
It's never too late  ... to dream ... to succeed ... to conquer. Well deserved ... (Thanks for making us smile)
She’s been doing this a looooooooong time. So happy for her 😍
She is naturally funny in ways that can’t be taught
Imagine her winning an Oscar how epic will THAT be 😍😍😍. So happy for her this has been her season
She’ll always be the combination of “knocking the UPS guy in the face doing the bend and snap” and “stifflers mom”. Perfection. 🤩💙
No prepared speech. She speaks from the heart. All celebrities should take note.
🤣
What did she say in the bleeped out bits?
So authentic, very well deserved, congratulations!
I've watched this over 10 times already. So heartwarming, funny and genuine. Her 'neighbors are speaking to her', LOL! Her ending in White Lotus was a shocker. I hope to see her in more shows.
Stiflers mom still looking hot... good for her!
This woman needs to be on more tv shows. I can see here doing really well as a reality tv judge of some sort. Her massive following would bring in the ratings
No one can ever beat her presence in American Pie. Epic
I just adore her so so much
Can we PLEASE get Jennifer and Olivia Coleman in a movie together. PLEASE!
She deserved it❤
Big congrats to her! I remember watching legally blonde way back in the day I thought she was so funny and bubbly. Also in American Pie movies. This is her year and hopefully many more awards waiting for her.
Her voice is soooo annoying, it makes me wanna listen to a lying democrat or CNN, which are the same.
I watched this three times ❤️🖤🫣🫣 anyone else watch this more than once?
Her speech confirms why I like her so much!! She is a great and naturally funny.
Okay now that she’s getting big you guys need to watch gentlemen Broncos
I love to listen to her ramble!!! 😂😂❤❤
Love Jennifer Coolidge since Legally Blond! I’m so happy for her! I even watched that horrible show 2 broke girls just because she was in it. Jennifer Coolidge is just awesome!
She’s one of my favorite actress. I’m glad to see her finally get her flowers
So refreshing to see some honesty in the room! She is so funny and real. Hollywood is no walk in the park. For every role represents thousands who didn't make it. She kept going thanks to people believing in her and her perseverance. Wow, what a journey, so happy for her!
I always forget that Ned Schneebly is the mastermind behind this whole thing.
Seeing Mike White cry made me teary eyed
Best line she has ever said "Makes me want a hot dog real bad."
.... This is one of the BEST wins of the night.  I really liked her speech! Aside from that, the show was so lousy. And that slimeball host was the worst host in golden globe history.
I’ve been watching this at least once a day. And every time, it’s refreshing. She’s the best!! 💯
Me and my sister is inlove with jennifer
Wow some of the actors and actresses in the front are so rude during this speech.
Why did they have to kill her off? 😢… it would’ve been great if she was always the surviving character 😂
😅I love her … 😍😍😍
Congrats to you Jennifer well deserved!!!
I’ve always loved her & followed her since I saw her on Friends. I feel like such an “arse.” I’ve watched everything she does and always wished she’d get recognized for her amazing talent. She is so unique. Such raw talent. A diamond in the rough. If you haven’t seen her in Best in Show, I highly recommend it.
Love her, so deserving. One of my favorite "minor" characters is when she threw the purse party on Sex & The City. "I cut up my bedspread for this!"   ❤😂
What did she sat at 2:38?
“My neighbors are speaking to me” 😂
Mike White tearing up because of how appreciative she truly is. So happy for her ❤
Omg why is she in movies anymore!!! She being a winner shows how bad shows and acting is!!
Mike white crying in love and amazement while Coolidge thanks him from the bottom of her heart ❤
Her speech showed you just how##### out these people are
OUR MOM
Icon.
I love her! Soo genuine! I loved her for yeaaars! She deserves all her flowers!❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I love her!  She is one of the few comedians that truly make me laugh.
can't comment now.. I'm still healing from my uncle's slap, he found me looking for my shoes in his wallet😭
L E G E N D A R Y!!!!!
I freaking love her.  And Mike White too… I still see him as the illiterate English teacher in Orange County 😂
She deserves every f*cking award she's up for, and then some.
I’ve always liked Jennifer in all the different things I’ve seen her in. There are no “little parts”, as they say. Everything she has done she has given it 110% of her talent. She deserves this. And I hope if her neighbors do invite her to their next party, she can say in that sweet, inimitable way of hers, “Gee, I’d love to. But that night I’m going to a big party in Hollywood…or is it Aspen? Oh, what’s the dif! Maybe next time.” 💞😁
Nobody cares
STOP STARTING THESE VIDEOS THE MOMENT AFTER THEY ANNOUNCE THEM. WE WANNA SEE THAT PART TOO
I want her to be my friend 😩
I LOVE HER...
Just going to say I can't really stand to watch anything on NBC!!! FAKE!!
L O V E HERRRRRRR!
She’s hopelessly and helplessly and endlessly hilarious.
This is honestly one of the best and most heart felt speeches I’ve heard in a long time. Comedic as well. She is amazing
PUT JENNIFER ON AHS. THIS INSTANT.💀🖤🖤🖤
went back to rewatch this.. i have tears in my eyes. Jennifer Coolidge you are an icon.. please never change. Your ability to just be you gives us more life. It's people like you that brighten this world. Ps. I loveeeeed the White Lotus and Mike White is truly a genius
"SOOOO MUCH LOVE FOR JENNIFER!!!" ❤️
This years Oscar had one the the lowest rating’s in decades.people are just done with Hollywood
I've watched this so many times already! I want to "like" this a million times 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
best awards speech
She’s so unintentionally funny 😂
Jennifer is gonna find herself on the A-List for a long time, I think. This might be, in some funny way her “big break”. I know I’m rooting for her!
Loved her since Best in Show!
I just love her 💖.  She is amazing on camera and so sweet and genuine when she speaks off the cuff.
Her Commercials are so funny!!!!
I love this lady. Such an awesome actress.
She's divine.
She's got some Don Rickles mannerisms and sense of humor in this speech. Things like saying "anyway" right after every roast to Mike White 😂. She's a true gem!
I love her always! Just so fun, quirky and funny
She needs to host SNL
Can’t believe she forgot to mention Christopher Guest as one of the people who kept her career going! Love her in all of the mockumentaries!!
She is literally everyone's spacy lovable mother
Stiflers mom is breathing like James gandolfini
I love her!
Jennifer is fun to watch! Well done!
Hollywood is full of miserable stars so it's a breath of fresh air to see authenticity.
Queen 🔥🔥
We love you Jen 💚🤟🏼🥂 Congratulations 🎉🎉😚
Hands down best speech ever! Lol
So glad they let her have her time because she's earned every bit of it! Well deserved. Congrats!
She freaking deserves this all!! Even a gracious acceptance speech from Jennifer has me screaming with laughter 🤣💖
I love her especially in 2 broke girls
She was so good in White Lotus!
I wanna see her and Regina king in a crazy female comedy! 😂😂😅
👏👏🤣🎉🎉
Every time I see her I hear, “You look like the Fourth of July. Makes me want a hot dog REAL BAD.”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Love her❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
She is one funny lady!!!  Lhs
LOVE THIS!!!!
Who cares
Uhhh her role in a cinderella story with my fav was where i first saw her… minor roles or not theyve always left their mark!
Oh my god who the hell cares!
She a milf ... pls get a hold of me i would love to talk n explore
I love  her.    She is  so sweet  ,  funny   !!!
Noone cares about the Golden globes
Look no further than her role in “Best In Show” (which is 99% improvised) to see that this woman is incredibly talented and naturally hilarious. So glad she’s getting the recognition she deserves.
Well deserved
It’s too bad she couldn’t take half the cast of that abomination of a show with her when she nailed her head on the side of the boat.
I love her and though we are thankful for mike white we shall never forgive for killing her off. My girl deserved to live
One of the few celebrities that I’ve never heard anything bad about. Always loved this woman and I continue to wish her the very best in life!
This is the sweetest purest authentic acceptance speech in that stage. Thank you Mike White for giving us Jennifer again
She almost made me cry And I don’t know who this Mike White is but he cried so humbly...he must be a great human being
Didn’t see and from the ratings, no one else did either
so lovable!!!
Finally a woman who is completely authentically herself in front of all of Hollywood. Did you see the looks from some audience members that were trying to understand or figure out Jennifer Coolidge. Well, Jennifer is more cool than half the folks in that room! God Bless Jennifer Coolidge!
“You make people want to live longer.”   What a beautiful compliment.
Love her. So happy for her🥲
She is too stinking cute! She always make me smile, she's just cool af🥰
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen 😅 she's the best
Who cares
Quentin Tarantino should cast her in a movie :D
I remember seeing her on an episode of road rules where they went to an acting class.  It's the voice that I recognized right away, that was back in the '90s. So glad she's made it. She definitely deserves it
I loved her in White Lotus! So well deserved and she's just so genuine and funny. I can't wait to see more of her on the screen. You're amazing, Jennifer!
I love JC but this was rough!
I don’t care what anyone says Stifler’s mom is an iconic role! Loved her in The Watcher. It’s nice to see her shine!
She is an incredible actress and super humble.  Love her.  Well deserving of the award .
The pedo awards
❤❤❤
Who gives an F. Hollywood sucks.
Jenn is the best! She is so incredible actress!
Hilary Duff is shook
Illuminati awards
Her time is finally come
No one with common sense gives two cents worth of caring about Hollywood elites giving each other praise.
Um, that was pretty epic.
the cussing is good! why are we muting the cussing!! cmon!
I could listen to her talking all day
To bad no one watches this crap anymore 😂
She’s so beautiful inside and out. I’ve followed her for so long and this made me laugh, teary eyes, and giggle. Truly deserving. Congratulations Jennifer 🙌🏽👏🏽💖
🤮
https://youtube.com/shorts/tdKV-TEOpqk?feature=share
National treasure!
Aw she is just so genuine!
If you haven't seen the gay Christmas film Single All the Way, she steals every scene she's in.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_67j4mGfH-0
Who cares?????
Stifflers mom is all I see
I once bought a Sobe drink 20 years ago and in the cap said " Stifler's mom". FYI I still have it!
We love ❤️ you too, Jennifer Coolidge!
this was a really golden globes. the best golden globes (that i’ve seen).
Love love love her!  Comeeee onnnnnn plot twist. 🤞 🎲 Hope her ‘secret twin’ was the one that actually died in season 2 of White Lotus and she’s back in 3! Would be a fun flashback story with so many exciting different ways to really make an incredible comeback!  ✌️🕯💛
I would love to know at what age she started to realize living without much of a filter was a gratifying thing. Or maybe she's just built that way and where the blessed spectators of her incredible humanity, authenticity and talent. Absolutely thrilling to see her finally received the recognition and reach this next stage of her career. We are all the better for it and hopefully she can teach some of the hollywood types how to live a more fulfilling life.
I love her
She was hilarious in Austenland!
Love her!❤
Love her. Too bad she wore Dolce & Gabbana 🙅🏼‍♀️
Ahhh Stiflers mom...
Love Love Love Her ❤️
Jennifer Coolidge is Legend. And if you don't know her you better know. Pure heart. Pure humbleness.  I just  love her to death. 💀🥀 Also,....she does a mean impression of herself. I live.  😆
I love her so much! She's one of my favorite comedic actresses of all time. She's so humble and yet geniusly hilarious as well. Congratulations to her. Long overdue 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼.
Lol.. she is so unbelievably funny! So glad she is finally getting her just Rewards. I can't believe within a day's time this video has received over 1 million views. Crazy, but wonderful. You go girl💃
At last a genuine person in hollyweird
This is the life of the actor...thank you...
cannot stand her
My friends call me and say "your girl's on tv" or "your girl won an award", because they know how much I adore this woman. For decades, literally, she has made me laugh and smile and I'm so happy for her now.
She's  as cool as other side of the pillow!
Stifler's Mommmmmm 😲😲😲🥹🥹🥹
Milf milf milf milf milf milf
I recently fell in love with her! She is everything!!!!
OMG I LOVE HER
She’s just the best; a real gem and kind human being! Love seeing her achieve this well-deserved, overdue success. Bravo!
Obviously rehearsed 😏 Jk She's frigging great!
I loved her role in the HBO series The White Lotus. I hate that her character died off in this second season. I’m going to miss her character.
I love stifflers mom she was funny as hell in American pie loved her in 2 broke girls to
Very honest...very funny...very human... Great lady...Brava!!
I want to be her best friend!
Give her a little job next season or something. She’s a national treasure. I’m glad her moment is here and it’s coming for more. She was stepped over by many in the last few years. This is her time now.
Just wondering, anyone know who is this audience member?  [ 3:22 ]  Actor? / Celebrity?
Ratings down over 60%! Get woke, go broke 😂
A national treasure
That was awesome
Love her ❤
Stifler's mom finally getting the respect she deserves!
I could tell people in the audience didn’t know how to receive her speech initially but it might be because they’re not used to the authenticity, Jennifer Coolidge is so humble & unique. Hope to see more of her after this win! ✨
Why have I watched this like ten thousand times?
About time! Hilarious 🤣
She has taken the wonderful late Betty White’s throne as a National Treasure 😂❤
I think this woman is hilarious!!!!!!!!
I love her so much!
Sick of woke garbage! Sick of weak degenerate woke Hollywood!
She been deserved this
She’s a living legend in my eyes. Like just imagine her and New York together. They would have the girls QUAKING!!!
Awesome. It’s a shame that hardly anyone watched
So well deserved, she deserves every award tbh.
I wonder who’s more proud, stifler or finch?
STIFFLERS!MOM YES!
That comment about people suddenly inviting her to events is what sickens me about humans. Don’t be nice to people only when you think they’re suddenly ‘valuable’ because of a job they got.
I adore this woman! Congratulations Jennifer! Well deserved recognition to a beautiful, funny, talented, sweet soul
So happy for you!!! Love you and your acting is amazing !!!❤
Shes a terrific actress.
I adore her. I lost my lifelong friend just months ago. She reminded me so much of Jennifer - humble, talented and funny.
lol! I was so upset when they killed her off White Lotus. To hell with season 3.  She was equally amazing in The Watcher.   Hopefully, she isn't typecast in this new season of her acting career.
Congratulations!
Stifler’s Mom!!
We don’t care I don’t care and one more thing so what. And more Botox please more Botox
That is by far the best acceptance speech in the history of all acceptance speeches!!!😂❤️😂❤️. Please somebody get her another role ASAP!!!!!
The saddest thing of Jennifer winning is that her role on the show is over, and we won't see her give speeches anymore.  She does the best "stream of consciousness" acceptance speaking ever.  "My neighbors ignored me until I did this show...."....too too good!  Also, Brad Pitt at 1:35 is great.  (Does the man ever age?)
I love this!!!!😂😂😂💯
Always. So.  Crazy.  I.  Love.  Her. Since. A.  Mighty.  Wind.
'And my neighbors are speaking to me ...'   I watched this video twice; both times I laughed and teared up; Jennifer is great and funny!
Stiflers mom is getting an award 🎉
What got bleeped out
Awe 💝🙆🏆👏💝💝💝💝💝 Beautiful Speech for a very well deserved award! Jennifer Coolidge is that Rare Real Diamond that is literally right there in the midst of it all Sparkling Dazzling REAL! And to hear her speech. God I have had those same feelings and then you get older and suddenly looking back it's like that younger person with all those easy Big Dreams...that seemed so easy...I used to wake up and lace up my Nikes and run outside for a 21 mile run. No biggie 😂 Nowadays....in my dreams! Back then everything seemed so attainable...and yet here I am now at 51 struggling to survive Cancer and praying every day to just make it. To Stay Alive. Everyday is a bad hair day. Every. Single. Day. The best I can do is the same old ponytail. Impossible to fix up or look better. Most days it's the best I can do. The White Lotus has been the Fresh Hawaiian Breeze of Hope and Laughter and Reality and Tears that My Soul needed so badly. Mike White 💝💝💝💝💝💝he created this Monsoon Tsunami Earth shaking Series ---the complexity and the reality of it just hits you. And not to forget Connie either🏆💝👏. And the Dad too! He has been taking bit parts and he too is older and he also does an Amazing job. All these characters and their stories are a microcosm of people we all are and know. It is So relatable. I have been alone on many of those trips where everyone else is supposedly having a fabulous time in Paradise and there I am...ALONE. ..This White Lotus is Something! It hit ME hard anyway because I feel at many times EXACTLY like Jennifer Coolidge. I watched White Lotus and I cried and laughed and a part of my pain was released and flew up and out and away 🐦 and I felt so much Better 🙆💝🏆 Love to Jennifer and Thank You Jennifer for Keepin On and still Going for it because You ARE a DIAMOND And I am Sending you Much Love 💝💝💝💝💝and Mike White needs to keep making this phenomenal series. He really does "Get" Society and our Culture and where we are today. He gets it all. Brightest Blessings to Jennifer Coolidge AND to Mike White 😎🌞💝👏🏆💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝 I Need You Both in my Life ~ Wild Irish Blessings 🍀
Hilarious and adorable as ever!
In another interview, she said how it was tough for her to make rent in time with the amount roles/pay she makes versus her peers. That’s what these little jobs were for her 😢
This QUEEN is a fresh breath of air.
So sorry they have lost so many viewers this year! They need to stay out of politics because people pay to be entertained not to be brainwashed!
So much fake lip she looks like jean simmons
She is the best! So humble and adorable! I love her and that she made Mike White cry....awesome
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Stifler’s mom is funny.
She was outstanding and her last scene was the best of the show lol . She is hilarious
What a funny, gorgeous woman...hope she continues to have a great and happy career.
Who are the neighbors Jennifer 🧐🤨?!
1764th  her words about MIke White were so touching
You just gotta love her lol
Congrats to my girl!  Simply adore her, hope she doesn't go to any parties on her 'hill', she doesn't need those people that snubbed her, lol
She has always been a jewel 🥰
I think the last movie or tv I watched was in 2012
She’s amazing! NBC, please ask her to host SNL. She auditioned years ago, you said no, and I don’t think you’ve ever asked her to host. You had someone do an impression of her in response to her fame before asking her to host?
Who?
Maybe the best acceptance speech since, "you like me, you really like me!"
What I'm still trying to get my head around is if you were her neighbor, why WOULDN"T you wanna have her over to your party? Let alone not talk to her every chance you get?  LMSFAO!
She truly deserves. She's has a great great career
Which one of them won Best Performance on Epstein Island?
So what?
As long as I don’t have to watch her terrible old navy commercial one more time , she can have any award she wants
“The Golden Globes happened?” — humans
No one watches this crap anymore...
🤣🤣🤣nobody cares. You “celebrities “ need a reality check. Talk about the most useless and worthless people on the planet.
Never heard of these people nor the movies that won awards.
Jennifer Coolidge is so humble and sweet. I’ve been a longtime fan of hers, like many other people, and I’m so glad to see her career better than ever and getting the recognition she deserves.
queen of acting and comedy
I bet the 5 people who watched the Globes this year all supported her.
These gays , they’re trying to honor her! ❤️
Like the late and beloved Betty White, Jennifer will be working as much as she wants for the rest of her life. She’s one of those folks whose career takes off in mid-life. ❤
I love u Sophie
She's so incredible. She represent the rest of us
Far out, about time. She's so funny and enigmatic. What a gal!
Fake people giving each other fake awards, sorry I missed it.
Looking forward to American Pie 6 or 7
YES JENNIFER!! Congrats!! I fell in love with her when she play Irene on American Pie, Legally Blonde & Pootie Tang & I fell in love with her ever since!! Omg, I’m tearing up! 🥹🥹🥹 I’m so proud of you Jennifer! Well deserved! ❤❤❤
Come over to Brunch Jennifer anytime….   Love to have you.
Stiflers Mom Forever!!!!
She's so dang fabulous.  I love her!
Who cares?!? Useless celeb idiocy.
i like speeches like these...where they talk about themselves and the people they need to thank.  NOT Like those A-LIST  f-uckers who thinks they know how the real world works.
Stifler's Mom wins again 🤙🏾👏🏾👏🏾.
GGAS ... A national disgrace!
Certain people just born icons
Ryan Murphy, please put her in a season of AHS!!!
I literally only know her as Stifflers mom
It's good to see a normal human being on stage. That is something very rare these days.  I wish her the best she deserved it.
She gets it! We love her
The White Lotus ! ❤
Well that not only the end of Golden Globes but takes out NBC as well,that entire thing was a train wreck,there was more people watching reruns of Sponge Bob.Best sweep this under the mat before anyone notices.
Complete Sentances
Only in Hollywood.
She rocks, it’s wild to think how much I’ve laughed with her over the years with the Christopher Guest films, congrats
Dang her speech made me laugh and tear up at the same time!!!! Such a kind hearted and genuine person I wish her the best❤
Nobody cares. The people in that room don't even care.
😊 this was nice
She reminds me of my friend with ADD. She goes in so many different directions at once, but says enough to make her points. And most importantly, she’s incredibly frank and open. I’m glad to see she’s finally getting recognized. I always thought she was great!
Beautiful as ever. I’m happy for her.
Nobody watches this woke bull crap. She’s not funny she even made Seinfeld less funny
Do people really watch celebrity popularity contests?  Dumb world.
If she ever needs a seat, my face is available.
I don't know how that happened cuz she is a shity actress!
What a great talent she is .
I remember her from Slappy & The Stinkers.
Anyone know what they bleeped out? I feel like it was hilarious
That’s a man
I love, Love, LOVE this woman and have since I first saw her: so real, so humble, so incredibly funny.  She had me holding my side from laughing while simultaneously crying sad tears.  THANK YOU Mike White, Ryan Murphy, Reese Witherspoon, et. al. for helping to make her dreams come true. She is a damn national treasure!
Who is the guy in that horrible dress ??  He needs better advice on how to dress.  That outfit did nothing for him.  Too much shoulders. Oh Jennifer was so great as herself, always funny.
Sooo glad for her win —-
Nobody cares. The comedian wasn't funny at all. I'm sure I wasn't the target audience.
Go woke go broke, we hate these hollywood elitists and their rewarding themselves. Hollywood is dead please cancel these shity shows. The media is the biggest Liars.
Best acceptance speech of all time
This is a honorable thing. Sad what these people get off on.
I LOVE HER SO MUCH❤
Waiting for American Pie : Stifler’s Mom 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Absolutely love her 💛💛💛💛
We need more people like this to give motivational talks. I'm so sick of hearing about the young prodigious talent who gets everything they ever wanted by age 22. That isn't most people. Folks who stay in the race as long as Jennifer have more to teach us.
Justifying that opening moment, “I can put this down, right? NO I JUST…” I’m dead from the start. What a humble and FUN treasure this woman is. SO deserving!! 💙
Guy in a dress was hilarious. No I didn't watch that trash
Love her!!! Well deserved 💜
And that's how you Bend & SNAP!! #❤❤❤her
I absolutely love her! Well deserved 💛
Her “out of breath” manner of speaking and her raw honesty and genuineness is just one-of-a-kind! She’s simply spectacular. ❤
NOBODY WATCHES THESE ENTITLED IDIOTS ANYMORE.  YOU GO WOKE YOU GO BROKE!  FACTS!
Damn I didn't know she was just playing herself in white lotus.
I don’t watch these awards but I love her and her beautiful speech
A long list of small parts most containing filth that continues the decline of moral standards and has defaced herself with plastic surgery to the point she can't sit down without her mouth opening. How are those ratings global globe....
Homegirl deserves it man. She's been hustling for a long time and she's an excellent actress man, freakin hilarious! Love her and this! 🖤🖤🖤
Life is hard. Hollywood life is harder. I knew her from Friends, and nothing more. Imagine that is where and how you achieve the prize today, chilly.
Gentleman broncos 💥
Well deserved! ❤ 😂 I love her so much. Such an icon and I am so glad to witness her career throughout the years. Xoxo
She is adorable! Congratulations! Well earned
You cant help but just smile when you see her.
Absolutely wonderful!❤
She was the highlight of the show. It was boring, dragged, I like the host but not at this. Seemed disorganized and unwatchable
I’m rooting for her, she earned a new fan because of white lotus!! 💜
She is simply ADORABLE ❤
She is so silly yet so classy!!! I enjoy every movie she’s in. She adds depth, everytime!!!
I love her so much no filter
Why did almost all the golden globe speeches almost make me want to cry!!
I love her, and anything she is acting in!!!  Congratulations!!!
Never in my 65 years have I ever heard of this woman! I'm really missing out aren't I!
I first saw her in Best in Show and other Christopher Guest movies. I thought she was a unique talent then! So happy for her.
Delightful - anyone know of an uncensored version?
night at the roxbury !
Do you know these gays, please they are trying to murder me. 😀 😃 😄 😁 😆 😅 😂 🤣
Stifler Mom ❤
Jennifer Coolidge is a terrible actress!
Lmao worst ratings in the history of this trash. Love it. No one cares what a bunch of idiots paid to pretend have to say. Pathetic.
Just Love Jennifer…Speaks from the Heart
The best part of the awards ceremony, hands down!
A room full of degenerate perverts. Disgusting
MY GIRL 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Me whose been binging 2 broke girls. How’s did they capture 2014 in a bottle! Some of their jokes hit hard years later. Some jokes are way 1990 inappropriate and my jaw drops like eek that a really bad joke. But she shines through like an icon forever set in stone on that show.
No one cares about these people.
Who is to say that too many, "umms", and "you know" can't take you far on a speech.
LOVE her.
Sounds like a pity party blah blah blah
Legend.
I really like Jennifer.  I hope she is as authentic in person as she is in her characters and on this stage.  One can certainly feel her honesty and how many of us feel about life, dreams and our own careers.  Thanks for being you :)
She is so funny!!!  💖💝
She's adorable
Who cares what a waste I'll never get that time back!
wait...STIFFLERS Mom?
Stifler's mom!  still hawwwt!
Sending prayers to Hollywood that they find the Lord Jesus Christ
Mike White was so happy for her that he teared up
The world would be a better place I'm everyone had just a little bit of Jennifer's humility and appreciation!!   I'm going on a Coolidge marathron.marathon.  Not to mention that she is a true comedic powerhouse....do you know how hard it is to do an entire movie of improve!!  She's up there with the greats...Catherine O'Hara  engine levy and the list goes on!!
Why is this trash showing up in my feed.  No one cares about these hypocrites.
"You make people want to live longer, and I didn't" wow 😭😢
Nobody watches those hollyweirdo pettoes besides losers of society just like them!
Jennifer Coolidge for President!
Stiffler's Mom did it! Yay! Good for her. Always thought she was hilarious.
This is when you wish the "thumbs down" button worked!!
I'm really a big fan of hers. Two women over 60 won top awards...beware of older women.
Jennifer Coolidge won best supporting actress when she accepts it and it's for The White Lotus. It was a Anthology Series or Television Motion Picture who for sake helped making good acceptance speech but when she told her story freely, she was more than words thanks to host Jerrod Carmichael since the series Brooklyn Nine Nine ended it's 12 seasons two years ago, it was the Limited Series on which network, Peacock, Showtime or Netflix or None of The Above. Coolidge said The Queen of Monaco was a place to see how it got older and when it did if this is the end since Mike worried about the world and animals, it doesn't matter and she added. Since it killed her off, and if it did, things changed cause if it does, Mike sort of changed her life in a million ways and her neighbors speak like that. She went on and say about the party she attend and here they invited Coolidge while the animals and where friend are not doing well, and what they say briefly. Coolidge. Mike White is still in his project. That anthology series is right here on HBOMax.......

Mike White??  that guy from Survivor? - yeah, I remember him .. congrats Ms. Coolidge
Overdue ❤️
She is just amazing 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Good for her
Not only am I so happy over Coolidge's glow up and long over-due recognition, as I've been a huge fan of hers since I was 9 and now I'm 32, go figure. But White has always been an unsung genius in the industry since I saw Chuck and Buck all the way back in the late 90s. He's a true original, no one mixes hilarious humor with abject darkness while still being moving and heartfelt quite like Mike White. Not to mention his range as writer, director , and actor. Enlightened was another great series he did on HBO with Laura Dern which was unfortunately cancelled after season 2 despite acclaim from audiences and critics. Year of the Dog is funny before it turns really sad with a great performance from Molly Shannon. Plus he wrote Orange County, School of Rock, The Good Girl, Beatriz at Dinner, among others. The man is a genius and I'm so glad he's also finally getting the long over-due recognition he rightfully deserves.
Ms. Coolidge is a VERY underrated American Treasure.
🎶 Stiflers mom has got it going on 🎶
One of the best speeches I have ever heard, love Jennifer
Omg the golden globes this year was so funny.. yet emotional, so odd had me crying every 15 mins 😂🤨
Genuine and beautiful...🎭
Who cares about the hollyweirdos wake up!
I think the "Neighbors talking to me" and  "Everyone is inviting me" are metaphors for she's getting many requests for jobs now.
Hilarious and personal!
Just another trash from Hollywood
I loved her in the white lotus she’s such a warming soul! So happy for her big win she deserves it all may she continue to gain even more success in the future. I love her!!
Zero fux given.. just says what she feels.. such a treasure!
We are in the end of times. Repent and be baptized. Turn to God. Matthew 3:2 and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven has come near.” Isaiah 45:22  Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I Am God, and there is no other. Acts 2:38  Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."  Pray and fast Philippians 4:6  Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. Joel 2:12 “Even now,” declares the Lord, “return to me with all your heart, with fasting and weeping and mourning.”  Jesus is the ONLY way to eternal life John 14:6-7 Jesus answered, “I Am The Way and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. If you really know Me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know Him and have seen Him.” John 3:16  For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:18  Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s One and Only Son. John 8:36  So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed Luke 18:20 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’”  Follow the Two Greatest Commandments Matthew 22:36-40  “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus replied: “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ This is the First and Greatest Commandment. And the Second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two Commandments.”  These will NOT inherit the Kingdom of God 1 Corinthians 6:9-10  Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  The absolute truth of God's Word Hebrews 4:12 For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Romans 10:17  Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 2 Timothy 3:16-17  All Scripture is God-Breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.   The present signs of last days Luke 21:20  When you see Jerusalem being surrounded by armies, you will know that its desolation is near. 2 Timothy 3:1-5  But mark this: There will be terrible times in the last days. People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, without love, unforgiving, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not lovers of the good, treacherous, rash, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God— having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with such people.  Beware of False prophets in the last days Matthew 24:4-5  Jesus answered: “Watch out that no one deceives you. For many will come in My Name, claiming, ‘I Am the Messiah,’ and will deceive many. Matthew 7:15-20  “Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves. By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them.  Wars and rumors of wars in the last days  Matthew 24:6 You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. Luke 21:10 -11 Then He said "Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes, famines, and pestilences in various places, and fearful events and great signs from Heaven.  The Gospel shared in the last days  Matthew 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, then the end will come.  People turning away from the faith in the last days  1 Timothy 4:1-2 The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron.  God's anger through weather Psalms 18:7-12 The earth trembled and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook; they trembled because He was angry. Smoke rose from His nostrils; consuming fire came from His mouth, burning coals blazed out of it. He parted the heavens and came down; dark clouds were under His feet. He mounted the cherubim and flew; He soared on the wings of the wind. He made darkness his covering, His canopy around him— the dark rain clouds of the sky. Out of the brightness of His presence clouds advanced, with hailstones and bolts of lightning.  Deny yourself to be a follower of Christ Mark 8:34-35  Then He called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “Whoever wants to be My disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow Me. For whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for Me and for the gospel will save it.  Confess Christ Matthew 10:32-33 “Whoever acknowledges Me before others, I will also acknowledge before my Father in Heaven. But whoever disowns Me before others, I will disown before My Father in heaven.  God loves you this much Romans 5:8  But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  Help others in need Romans 12:13  Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.  Keep the Sabbath Day Holy Exodus 20:11  For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but He rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.  Make disciples of ALL nations. Spread the gospel. Matthew 28:19-20 Get the Bible and have it on day and night when you sleep to learn and stay in God's Word. Stay in prayer and repent. I'm sharing the Word of God. God is the ONLY ONE who can save us with everything going on. God bless you. Jesus loves you.
I'm almost certain he's crying cause there's a camera in his face....
“You make people want to live longer when I didn’t” damn
Surely she’s kidding! A freakin hook came and took her out at the Emmys?
YES JENNIFER COOLIDGE!
Love her! Would love to hear this without all the censoring!
"Positively ghastly!"
She’ll always be Stiflers mom! I love her so much.♥️
I saw her greatness on Two Broke Girls. She's a very gifted and funny actress.
I've had a crush on Jennifer Coolidge for 20 years. But all that aside she seems like such a fun personality, would love to just hang out with her. So happy she's getting the recognition she deserves! Great, chaotic speech!
I hope she gets more roles! She’s amazing!
💜💜💜💜💜
Heard the vierwship was down lol.
I hope she will live a long great life. We need to protect her at all costs.
It is spelt melbourne but it is said Mel-born not Mel-burn
I loved her as Britney’s mom she was the perfect cast
I love Jennifer Coolidge
She can fake honesty...  she meant every word she spoke... a great acceptance speech!!
What an actress..good grief!
this was the funniest part of the show and this wasn't scripted!
So in and out of character...she is priceless, one of a kind.
Dammit I LOVE Stifler's Mom LOL ;) Congrats Jen.
She’s the best
I absolutely love everything about her energy like I haven’t seen much of her work but now I definitely want to bc her authenticity is so captivating I must see more! ❤️
Good for her, but she’ll always be stiflers mom.
Bend and snap baby
That speech made me believe in the Golden Globes again.
"they love me, they really love me!" 😂💨
She deserved this award!!! Congratulations Jennifer!!!
I really didn’t like the ending of White Lotus. I love her.
I love has she pretty much plays herself in the couple roles I've seen her in
Cocaine
Somehow, my favorite Jennifer Coolidge moment is from the blooper reel when she appeared on Friends...yea, I can watch that endlessly....congratulations to her!
I want to know what the censored words are!! 😂
She rambled on like an idiot for over 4 minutes but most who won only had approx 30 seconds for their speeches.
Whats up w/her face?cocain and prozak?
Stifler would be proud 👏🏽
She rambles- but she’s funny and authentic. I love what she said - her friends kept her going just long enough to get to the next job. She is now winning awards and people like her and invite her over. It’s a window into Hollywood- they dont invite you unless your famous. But she kept going- kept surviving - kept plugging away. She gives hope to all those over the hill people who still have dreams! Keep dreaming- keep plugging- keep surviving. Your hilltop is just over there! Love her.
Is there anyone more lovable? She is so great.
Your great in everything, but you always be Stifler's mom to me baby! 😋
What show is it
She’s Legend She Deserves It 20 years an still Going American pie Classic ❤❤❤
One of the worst actresses ever, that's only back in the limelight thanks to Ariana Grande. All she plays is one note bimbos with too much botox in every role.
I love her! but I am gay so is part of the gay DNA. There's very little I can do about it.
I applaud this wonderful speech! I laughed and felt such an urge to cry. So compelling!!!! Congratulations to Jennifer Coolidge.
Hell yeah Stifler's mom!
JUST BEAUTIFUL!!!
Truly an unappreciated comedian. Folks are crazy not to give her more rolls. What scene doesn't she steal? What a joy!!
I had the joy of seeing her do standup.. SHE IS SO FUNNY...I love how she just does not give 2 *****
Please, SOMEBODY, give this woman a show with Aubrey Plaza as co-star and I’ll die a happy man.
She is AWESOME!  Loved her before, love her even more now.  The best.
Jennifer is the GOAT.
We should all thank Mike White! For seeing her and her potential when others didn’t or wouldn’t
A humble, talented, and funny Queen👑 ✨ she deserves every bit of success she has. Made me tear up.
Hey, this is Stifler's mom.😝🤪😝
Congratulations! Well deserved! 😀
She is amazing!
I wanna have her mindset. She really is a neat person!! Congrats Jennifer!!!
Iconic!❤
I love this!!! ❤❤❤❤
Omg I love her!!!

Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭 the most funniest actress of life. I was rolling throughout the whole speech!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 authentic Af.
I didn’t understand half of the things she said but I loved every second of it 😂 I love you Queen
I cannot love a celebrity more than I love Jennifer Coolidge
So  my husband just said that now that Weinstien is out of the picture it gives many other women opportunities!
Jennifer- you deserved this award for Legally Blonde and many others. You are unique, witty, organically funny, and a genuinely fun authentic person and actress.
I love seeing Brad Pitt laugh and melt over her in the front row. Amazing
She’s always the best character in any movie or tv show she’s in🙏🏼😇 It’s about time she was acknowledged for her work. Congratulations!! 🫶🏼👏🏼🎊🥂
Stiffler's Mom 😈
She’s the best. Folks 👀 didn’t want to give her work…… an icon and naturally funny.
I love her!
She’s the best. Seriously. I died a little inside when you were killed off. I needed resuscitation. Lol No seriously, Bravo! ❤️
Thank you for showing us, dreams do come true. ♥
I STAN.
Are you kidding me?! I would invite her to every party I ever had! She is so incredible and I love her so much! What an inspiration and a goddamn bombshell of an icon!
Who could not love this authentic, hilarious woman?? She's legendary.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love her and her speech...HBO been her back ....we love her❤❤❤
Jennifer Coolidge turns light and shadow into pure magic. She’s hot AND funny as f….. absolutely elated to see her finally be recognized for the goddess she is.
What a talent, love her
Good for her! She deserves it!
3:23 who is the man wearing a dress LOL
She ABSOLUTELY deserves it. So happy for her.
WIt a minute she ain’t polish #2brokegirls
Much deserved! Such a precious human being.
Happy New Years everyone❤️‍🔥 John 3:16 : “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.”
Stifflers mom is ageless!
You are my favorite character on the White Lotus. I told my husband that they better not kill you off and then they did!! Dammit!! Congratulations on winning the award!!
I just love her!!!   Just looking at her makes me smile.  Another of the “five” that kept her in jobs was Christopher Guest!
NOBODY CARES!!!!
Stiflers mom has barely aged at all she's a rare breed of MILF
There are like 5 people she wanted to thank and at the end it was only Mike White...she is a very smart show woman...if she just said Mike White it wouldn't have been as hilarious. Made him cry...moving and funny at the same time yep she's smart.
My God I love her even more now. I didn't think that was possible. That was the best speech ever!!
No one cares, did you see the rating’s ?
❤
Is Jennifer ADD or ADHD?
Just lover her , hope to see  her doing SNL will be there for it
Stiffler Mom 😂
beautiful. and incredible.
She’s so flippin funny!  And truly amazing!  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
didn't watch the awards show. just here for jennifer. get it!!!
She deserves it. Justice for Tanya!
Been watching her for years, so glad she's getting her flowers. Congratulations 💐
It's so amazing to see people like her and Brendan Fraser making comebacks in their careers. They deserve it and I'm so here for it! 👏 👏 👏
yikes, woman on verge of a nervous brake down........
I'm  64 yrs. old and used to admire the Hollywood elites and now you couldn't pay me to be in their presence.
I have absolutely always loved her. It makes me happy to see her talent recognized.
Such a real moment in a world of scripted nonsense.
🙌🏽🙌🏽
Judging from her failure to curb her morbid obesity, she'll be dead from a heart attack in less than a year.
THE BEST!!!!
Stiflers mom damn fine
Best speech of the night!! luv her!!! ❤️
So adorable
Jennifer is a national treasure! From the heart as one can be, authentic, and funny. LOVE HER!!!❤️
It's about time. She is hilarious
This hit me right in the feels.
She made him cry . So sweet and he looks so kind
omg would not have expected to be in tears from an awards speech like this, unless it was of laughter lol but especially when she got to talking about mike white—damn!! i'm so glad they found each other, and i'm so happy she's had such success through playing tanya and knowing mike! and no one could play tanya like her!! and deserves all the acclaim awards she's gotten for her twl performances! although i will admit i'm hoping at least one goes to aubrey plaza hahaha
Pls send a dollar $zyienj1
What a horrid show. 2nd lowest rating in it's history and for good reasons.
Love her since the day I seen her for the 1st time! Her natural talent on/off the stage…❤
🎊  🎉She deserves it!
Love Her! 💋🥰
Protect this woman at all costs
What does she say at 2:38?
Very pretty/funny……….. hope she starts an exercise program
She is such a gift to us all. Jennifer you are amazing 😂❤give her more awards
I've always loved Stifflers Mom but she is so much more
Omg, love that for her!!!! 🥰🥰
She’s adorable! Glad she won!
Cheers to her and her career.
She deserve it an a lot more
Is she playing her character in real life or did they add her as a character in white lotus?
Wow! She is awesome
I like her...she's funny.  Glad she won a GG! Bravo! 👍
Who don't Love her?
Love her in every single thing she’s in
I adore her omg my heartttt
SIMPLY THE BEST‼️‼️‼️
Even with minor roles she has been iconic in all of them! Like honestly not that many ppl can say that. From American Pie to legally blonde and etc.. she has always stood out and we have all noticed
Watched her for first time in legally blond, I was rooting for her success ever since, congratulations
She’s also revealing in her humor how phony life in Hollywood is—-(and to some extent life is in Status chasing America); before white lotus not even her neighbors knew her and now there’s no party where she is not being invited to. Kind of the point of her speech is that she’s finally arrived to the status class she had chased for so many years with little gigs that kept her going. Hope she realizes how it can also “fizzle” away and manages to stay real regardless of the amount of invitations.
We Love You.. 🙌
aww she is adorable, and notice how she keep talking about others in her speech most of the time.
Was she high or drunk?  I mean she made no sense what so ever
Is that Stifler's Mom?  Ya know, I thought I had two fuc*s to give for the Globies...I couldn't even find one.  Prentincious Pri**s all.
Did she just spoil something about White Lotus that people who haven't watched it might not know
I’m so glad Jennifer is getting the flowers she DESERVES
She’s such a gem  ❤
Idk what she was even saying half the time but congrats to her 😅
She’ll always be Stifler’s mom to me.
Stiffler's mom has got it goin on👍🏼
Love her! She is more deserving than most actors for persevering by using her real talents and tenacity! She has inspired me!  Totally authentic! True American Treasure!
I adore her ♥️♥️♥️
I love her
I have always really liked her a lot. So happy she was recognized!
I just love Jennifer Coolidge. I enjoy her presence no matter what show or where she appears. She’s so real, genuine and authentically funny! Love, love, love her.
No one cares, circle jerk hollyweird award shows are a thing of the past, let go with grace.
Love her!
She is just genuine!!! Very much deserved!!!
No one cares about this stuff anymore.
I absolutely love her!!!!
We could tell that you don't workout . She was Shamu in the movies I never seen that bitc.
I love this lady so much. I enjoyed watching her. I don’t know why they didn’t give her more roles to play in movies. She’s a good human being.
Welcome to the party straights, us gays have known she was a living icon for decades!
Her acting always came across as kind of corny to me but everyone else likes her....
One of the realest out there
What a goddamn icon. I will watch any video of her
I love you Jennifer and I'm so happy you want to live longer❤️
Don't care, (I gave up on Hollywood a long time ago.
Love her. I was always bummed she never made a guest appearance in Schitt’s Creek. She would have been amazing. I’ve been obsessed with her, Catherine and Eugene since their Christopher Guest days.
She is BONAFIDE PERIOD
She is exactly like her character
demons celebrating demons
Adele?
How cares?
Love her
I so love her…
Ya gotta luv Jennifer! That’s one real dame!
Love yah 💞
Hey, hold on second. Okay NO ONE CARES. Who watches this garbage?
I am glad she thanked Mike White.  I was wondering why she didn't acknowledge him at the Emmys.
I would be the same way !
Incredible
Big fan of hers from American Pie, to  a guest spot in Friends, 2 Broke Girls!! And Legally Blonde--how can I forget that one!
NATIONAL TREASURE FOREVER. xoxoxo
When I worked on 2 Broke Girls for 6 seasons with Jennifer, she was one of the most authentically nice people you could ever meet. She ALWAYS had time to say hi to the audience members, sign autographs, and take pictures with them. Plus, she was just funny as hell to talk to. I am happy for her.
How can you not love this lady my God!!!!!! So glad she won
I love this woman!
🙌🏻 PERSEVERANCE  Un—F—doubtedly!!
❤
The bend and snap!  Loved her in Legally Blonde.
It’s really refreshing to see a Celebrity so genuine. No acting or pretentiousness, just speaking straight from the heart.
You got this Tanya!!!
just want to let ya know that God loves you all, we have to turn from sin and repent before it’s too late, John 14:6 says “I’m the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the father except through me”🙏🏽🤍
Milf milf milf milf milf
Idiot
raw and real
This makes me want a hotdog real bad.....
Who is she talking to ? Nobody watched the bs anymore
Gosh I love this woman
She makes me want a hot dog REAAAAAAALLL bad lol we love you Jennifer!!!
Love her❤
Stifflers Mom
She is soooo funny, naturally funny. Love her❤
🤣
Jennifer Coolidge doesn’t care about you so why should you care about her??? You’re all morons.
I’m glad they let her talk this time. She was still a bit rushed, but I understand during award shows they need to keep it moving. I’m glad she’s receiving the recognition as well, Jennifer is great in every role I’ve seen her play.
you can love Jennifer Coolidge or you can be a cold emotionless automaton not capable of that emotion!
LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU  ♥️ from Chicago
Jennifer is freaking AMAZING! I’m so happy for her. She’s getting some of her well deserved flowers!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 And it makes me want a HOTDOG REAAAL BAD!😆
This was so wholesome to watch
I love her
Rhea Seehorn deserved this the past five years.
I’m crying so hard I love her so much!!!
She is a good actress. Hated the white lotus though. Too much gay sh*t going on.
Overpaid tool's. All celebrities are
That's a ugly white woman 😆
Mike White is so sweet. I can’t believe he was on Survivor.
she is finally getting her moment & I love it! deserves all her success & hope her winning continues throughout awards season
I love how Brad looked at her.
So happy for her, she deserves it❣
White Lotus will not be the same without her!
This women transcended from bit part in American Pie to a performer capable of carrying an entire series herself. I’m happy for her to have found such success.
Ladies and Gentleman: The ICON Jennifer Coolidge✨❤️
Her best role is still Stiflers Mom!
She deserves it 👏 ❤️
Absolutely the best. She is a real Hollywood gem and lady. We all adore you Jennifer. Don’t ever doubt that 3:15
thats my BOO! #congrates 😘🏆
DESERVED. So happy she is FINALLY getting the appropriate, gahdamnned recognition she should have had years ago! Slay, Queen!
So funny
Should have won this award for her performance in American Pie.
This is the most worthless thing I can think of
Looks gorgeous
I just love her 😍
Good for her! She is a funny lady!
OG milf
Surprised she didn't mention Christopher Guest.  He put her career on track with Best in Show and a Mighty Wind.  That's how I first saw her on screen.
Jennifer Coolidge is Jennifer Coolidge and that's AMAZING!  How FABULOUS is she!
You make a better host then the host. He was awful.  Didn’t know him before and don’t care to know him now.  They should hire you next year.  A breath of fresh air. ❤
Yaaas Queen, congrats !
I love her she’s so funny and beautiful
She’s a lot of all the best things!
About damn time ! She is an icon
Andrew Cuomo got Emmy award for killing 10 thousand seniors in New York.
I only know her from 2 broke girls but she’s hilarious
You can tell she didn't expect to win. But I'm so glad she did. Such an icon, who deserved recognition before now.
Straight up cougar
So moved by her speech.
Stifler's mom has got it going on!
There's still a Golden Globes on TV? 🤔 hmm..
Who would live down the street from her and not ask her to their parties? She’d be the first one I’d ask and to hell with the rest of them!
I've watched this 3 times now
I love her!  She made me cry!
I will forever love her and she’s a Icon !!!!! I hope she knows this !
Dear Hollywood— please give this woman more awards so we can hear more of her speeches.
OH God I love this lady!
Jennifer Coolidge is a national treasure & one of the best & funniest speeches of the night. I know Jennifer is curvy, but she looked pregnant here when they showed her side angle.
ICON!!!!
Legend.
I just wanna say... ...I fu*#!ng love Jennifer Coolidge.
That’s the way it should be done 😘
She still fine af
What goes woke goes broke
Can we bring Jennifer Coolidge back for Season 3 White Lotus as Tanya’s long lost Identical Twin?
She does it well. ❤
Who?
Heavenly angel I love her
Mike White crying is so pure. I love this guy.
Congrats Mrs Stifler!
So humble and hard working.
I had no idea where she was going with that and I didn't care. I'd sit down and watch her just talk for hours and pay top dollar to do so.
I love her so deserved!
MILF! MILF! MILF!!
I love her
We know who YOU are!! And you are soooo worthy!!
This woman knows she knows and knows her gift! She’s a completely pleasant, joyful and a gift to us. Keep going, Ms. Coolidge. You are so loved. One of one!
Hi
She’s annoying AF 🙄
She’s annoying AF 🙄
Remember her from the legally blond movies. American pie? Haven't watched it but she's a great actress and I know she did well in them. I love her she's a great
I'm glad you won, Jennifer. You have such a unique comedic talent that is rare and genuine.
She is such a great actress and I get very excited every time I see her appear in a show because I know it’s going to be good. Thank you for giving us the best you got.
3:23 who’s the dude in the dress ?
That's stiffler's mom...milf milf milf
Who?
She is a national treasure...she was in Lexington, KY circa 2011 maybe?.. at a comedy club across the street from the mall where I worked..she came into cosmetics one morning, very unassuming..we chatted lowkey and I was trying not to be a goober since I love her..she bought a bronzer, Hoola by BeneFit...I remember thinking later I should've asked her if I could do her makeup (hindsight is 20/20..lol..but she was charming and lovely and prettier in person...such a funny and talented lady..she is having her moment..and deserves many more..
Congratulations Jennifer! You deserved it.
Total tosser
When people really expressed how much they are thankful with sincerity. Don’t heard much from her as a person (is a good thing) only in shows and movies and she is brilliant on her carácter. Congratulations
Oh wow, no one cares.
She's come a long way from only being known as Stifler's mom.
What a genuine class act.  And, yes...funny as hell.  Love you !
LOVE THIS WOMAN!!! Lady Coolidge ~ You deserve ALL these wonderful moments!!!! 🔥 ❤️ 🏆
Simply the best speech you can give to appreciate an opportunity life gives. God bless everyone that shows everyone around them hope to succeed
She's so iconic! I love seeing her in every movie or tv show she's in. She deserved this award!
“I don’t know what’s going on with Greg….but I think it’s all BS!” My daughter does her accent perfectly so I make her repeat her lines all the time! So glad she won❤️🙏🏾
So she basically is playing herself in "White Lotus".
I don't think anybody cares did you check the ratings go woke go broke
God she’s great!
QUEEN!!!
STIFFLER'S MOM!!!!!!
I just love her to death I wish we could hang out❤
Awards shows. Yawn. Cosmetic surgery and ugly dresses on parade. And political pontificating.
Perfection
Wait did she just spoil season 1? I didn’t finish it yet
Fantastic!
She really does talk like that!!! Just love her!!!
“You did kill me off” 😂 she’s too funny and glad she won!
What a political blunder....
Damn she finally got award it's sad
I’m happy for her, she’s being doing her thing for so long and is great!
Who gives a bucket of piss about these put of touch with reality douchebags
LOL 😂 “I don’t work out I can’t hold it that long.” She is so hilarious even when talking about holding her award.
She deserved this.
She will always be stifflers mom
She should’ve done the “bend and snap” when picking up her award!!
Can we get the uncensored version of that speech.
Jen needs to host the Oscars. Period.
🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
I love her in American Pineapple 🍍
I adore her. She’s a true icon.
Wait, is this her first one? She's always been super original and tru to herself.
“You make people wanna live longer, and I didn’t.”
Amazing. Can’t believe she won’t be on season 3 😢
BIG girl.
She’s pretty funny in her sincerity. 🌞
❤‍🔥
She’s a pip!
She’s so awesome. Bless her
She deserves it ALL, national treasure. I love her
You know her from many small roles. It's good to see she is finally getting some recognition.
For an award ceremony that saw its LOWEST NUMBERS EVER (5,300,000), Jennifer Coolidge stole the whole show.
I've always loved Mike White since School of Rock
She stood out in Best In Show-if you haven’t seen that movie.  Also has Eugene Levy who was awesome in it.
Jennifer Coolidge's acceptance speech got me to watch this BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS series White Lotus.
She’s  amazing and needs more roles Hollywood
"You changed my life my neighbors are speaking to me" sent me around the globe ☠️🤣😭
Why was it so long and why didn’t she get played off
About damn time!  My Mom and I quote her to this day.  Congrats, Jennifer!!
Love this lady
So glad & happy for Angela Bassett....you go gurl..
Maybe you didn't know this so I'll tell you. God's son Jesus loved you so much that he died nailed to a cross for your sin so you could go to heaven instead of hell! Repent and believe today.
Shes talking about kindness and compassion. I just love Jennifer Coolidge. Just adore her.
T H I C C C
Mrs. Coolidge, As Mr. Darcy said, You have bewitched me, body and soul and I love.... love.... love you!  You are truly grateful for what you have been given.
I love her
I bet this YouTube video gets more views than the actual golden globes did last night.
Omg 🤣 she needs to do stand up comedy, she's just naturally funny. This was great to watch! Congrats Jennifer 👏🏽
lol.....awards for hollyweird...pass.  havent seen anything good from that state in years.
That whole broadcast was terrible. I want tune in next year. I gave it two👎👎
Dear Jennifer Coolidge~  You probably won’t read this, but if you do…  You are so much more of an amazing human being than you may realize. And you are true, and beautiful, and iconic. And I wish that everyone in your past, present, and future (including you!) can see your value the way Mike does.   I am so happy for you to win this prestigious award. These days? Awards often seem diminished by who I see receiving them. But you merit this recognition, and conferring this honor to you only raised the value of having such awards in the first place.   I wept at the end of the White Lotus, btw.  I did not like thexways that character’s issues indirectly hurt others; yet I had much compassion for her.   You make unreal characters real. You make not very likeable characters lovable.   You are Beautiful in a way that Time can never tarnish. (Haha, I am hetero, so I write truly but without crush or attraction.) And. (I don’t know what your beliefs are, but I am going to add this too. It is my earnest conviction.) God very dearly cares about you. He can heal it all. Put new hope in your spirit, even after this wonderful time has passed.  You are Golden, Lady. Stay safe, and Congratulations. 🎉✨🙏🤍
Well deserved award.  Kudos to her for finding inspiration even during the lean years and providing inspiration to so many others.
Mike White You ROCK💕
"The Hollywood Foreign Press are very very racist."
I’m surprised she is not in SNL yet.
I am so glad when people like her wins an award ……
She is the BEST! Hands Down. We love you Jen!! No one Like YOU!! ;-)💕💕💕 So many shows I watched bcuz YOU were in the cast. (Props to everyone else) 😍😘Love to ALL!
I love J Cool!
Effortlessly funny 🥹
Love, love, love her!
I recognize her from Frasier. She was going to be Martin's physical therapist after Daphne moved out.
Gosh We the Gays love you so much !! 🎉❤❤😅
Brad Pitt Is still hot lmao
Omg ❤❤❤❤
Isn't it ironic, how woke Hollywood still has awards separated by sex? Proof that men and women are different ;-)
Love her!  Congrats! :)
Who watched this crap ? Lol
Everyone loves her. EVERYONE Her speech was incredible !
I just love her! Let her talk! 🙏❤️
She's been underneath for so long. Love her.
You know
I love this woman! I love watching this over and over!
I LOVE HER AND LAUGHED 😂
What a sweetheart, she's great🙂
Best in show!
She is just so charming and likable.
Oh Wow, wow, jeepers she’s the best, ya know?
She should host the next award show cause she's funny as hell. Love her.❤❤❤
What did she say that was bleeped out?
When I started seeing clips of her in circulation I thought it was from Jump Street
Love the standing O in the end 🖤 she deserves it all
She should have been in the lead actress category
She deserves every bit of this! A true LGBT icon!!!!
I cried
She was my neighbor growing up. Norwell rules!
Stifflers mom!
Her acting in Legally Blonde was awful.

damn... can we agree are we all ECSTATIC her neighbors are talking to her?
I just love her! ❤️
First saw this wonderful woman on Slappy and the Stinkers, and since then she has been a staple for me. Anything she is in is good just from having her in it. This is well deserved!
Golden Globes are still the best. And nobody got slapped!
White people aren't allowed to win awards this year at the Golden globes? Can someone please explain this debacle? I mean white people are being exiled and a racist every time we turn around and of course the Golden globes which no one else watches can be nothing but the same. I'm just shocked that there's a white person that's winning this year's Golden globe I thought that was against the federal government's rules definitely the Democratic rules that white people aren't allowed to win it's just a theory
She is the bomb!!!!
another freak show
What a Gem she is.
She is such an icon.
I love her --- so REAL!!
Can someone please give her a Golden Globe for A Cinderella Story too?
I love her.   And I’m so glad I *finished* watching White Lotus season 2 before this acceptance speech.
LOVE STIFFLER'S MOM!!!!!!  YES!!!!!!  👍🤗💞
Who is the non-binary at 3:22?
She is our new Betty White, a beautiful woman all the way to the end.
Love her 💘
Jennifer is in galaxy all her own ... love her tremendously - and - congratulations 🎉!!!
Wasn't she in Legally Blonde way back when?  She and the UPS guy were so funny.  Then she broke his nose.  Ha Ha.  Congratulations on the win.
Mike White is my hero too. JC you rocked that speech.
Nobody cares Hollywood is dying
I used to think she was hot back in 98, 99, but she was not attractive physically or any other way as I got older, nothing has changed, old navy commercials are very trash, and I don't understand why anyone would care what she says or does... good day...
Maybe Jerry Seinfeld will get his massage from her finally. Love her.
Love her.  She's just great.
I just saw Mike's face and I lost it. There's real love, appreciation, and respect there. Congrats, Jennifer.
Milf! 😂❤
How sweet is she!
I’ve never seen anyone who can communicate so much, yet never finish a sentence.  She really is rare.
I’ll have what she’s having!! 🍸
She low key called out everyone who didnt invite her out to parties but all a sudden they want to include her
Priceless! ✨✨✨✨✨✨
Oh my gosh. Amazing! As always. Perfection.
Did anyone really watch this s** show?
Final a white person won at the black person awards, this and last year, years of the blacks, must pitiful. Giving awards to blacks for no ungodly reason, yeah for the white person who really did earn it and not for the color of their skin.
She is a GEM. I hope we see more of her authentic funny.
What was the profanity. Someone?
Mike White or Ned Schneebly??  Congrats to Jennifer!!
I would've stood throughout her entire speech. Well deserved. Amazing! I've ran out of ways to describe her. Legend!
Award shows suck.  They have become a WOKE JOKE!
What are the golden globes? 😆
"my neighbors are speaking to me..."
There are no overnight successes. Simply people who would not quit. Thank you for not quitting Jennifer!
The world needs more Jennifer Coolidge, Hollywood. GET IT DONE!
I just love her and i will watch anything with her, whether it is a "little job" or a big one.
She’s the best. 🥰
support our entertainers cause life would be boring w/ out them
She's pretty much like a lot of us who speak in public and go in so many directions because we just have so much to say but never get a chance to express it. Good for you Jennifer! Glad she got the nod and appreciation she deserves for being in the industry this long. I love her nod to Mike White that moved him to tears. Sweet woman. They should have given us the uncensored version in another video. LOL.
I love Jennifer!🤩🤩 So happy for her! Well deserved👏🏾👏🏾
I live for her!
A true icon. She deserves the world. If you see this. Which I doubt. I love you QUEEN!!
I hope she comes back for season 3 of White Lotus! I’m hoping that she ended up faking her own death and she comes back to kill her horrible husband!
She's adorable.
I’m always amazed by how she makes everyone else feel. If you look at the faces in the room they are all smiling at her ❤️ she’s truly something special 🌟
I am glad she won, but I still think these Golden Globe Awards are unfair when it comes too the TV awards.Cable, streaming, and regular TV are all lumped into one category. It's so unfair because each have different standards and requirements.
The term "Milf" literally came from this woman
I was hooked on Jennifer Coolidge from the time I first saw her in “Best in Show.” She is an added enjoyment to everything she graces with her presence.
She made me laugh and cry simultaneously. Jennifer deserves all the awards!
She is an amazing talent an amazing women with a BIG heart. What an Icon.
Watching Jennifer speech last night brought a tear to my eye.Also reading everyone's comments below also brought a tear to my eye.
Y know 😂x99
Most of the people she is thanking are gays. The gays have always known she is an icon ever since Legally Blonde. It's nice the rest of the world is seeing it too.
I shed some tears because I understood everything she said: her career may not have gone how she intended it to go but she ended up where she needed to be because just enough ppl believed in her to get her to this big moment
She looks like she's been dead for 10 years all these Hollywood people all look they are dying or something that's what happens when you worship marxism
How can you not love her!  She is so underrated!!! ❤
She is awesome and hilarious she is a comedy legend.all comedy directors book her you won't regret it
I Love Her 🌹🌹
WE LOVEEEEEE YOU!!❣ MISS JENNIFER.  YOU DESERVE ❤  THE GOLDEN, THE OSCAR!! END EVERYTHING!! YOU ATE AT AMAZING  STAR 🌟.  BLESSINGS!! AND PLEASE!! KEEP GOING. FROM THE EAST HAMPTONS. WE REALLY  ADORE YOU ❤
Stiflers mom is the best
Stiflers mom finally got rewarded for her work
Nothing but ❤️
How is White Lotus a limited series, isn't on season 2?
What a mess !!!!!🤣💀🤣💀💀😂
I didn’t even know it took place yesterday? A Tuesday? That is weird.
gold - I want more JC
She never fails to make me laugh out loud!  Love her!
Yes, I did watch the 80th Golden Globe Awards telecast to the very end; I just love awards shows. All that hair dyed and fake hairs, was just as expected, after all, that’s show business. Speaking of which, how about the new current crop of hair dyed and wigged women fronting their own televised talk shows. It’s a disease that has spread to news and information TV programing, nobody should expect to see hair dye and wigs on the heads of journalists, one would think they would be beyond such gimmickery, news is supposed to be about some sort of reality, that is not so much true with journalists on TV anymore.
I thought she was acting like Adele 😂💀
I love how she barely says anything and people are already cracking up lol she is so loved
So glad Jennifer is getting the recognition that she so well deserves.  I love everything she in.  Even on The Watchers, she was on point.
Jennifer is an original in every sense of the word. She is just so compelling and vulnerable and touching and real…and funny all at the same time. Once you’ve seen Jennifer Coolidge..,you never forget her!
On my hill! Hahahahaha omg I am dead ..she’s hilarious l!
Wow, some authenticity. It’s unbelievable that they let her stay so long. 😊
She is a true icon. There is NO ONE else like her on this planet.
Okay, i just finished White Lotus , and didn’t get the chance to really know who wrote the show . When I found out it was thee Mike White (School of Rock) I gasped! No wayyyy!!! This man and his skills.
I love Jennifer Coolidge. She's such a loveable oddball. LOL Congrats Jennifer!
I love it. She is great and the speech was the best I’ve heard at an award show.
C'mon, man, don't censor them.
Who watches TV?
I laughed and teared up and then laughed again. She's epic and doesn't even know it!💯
Oh yes
Pamela Anderson look different now
This woman is truly brilliant.
I love her.  Wring her off the show was an injustice.
She’s so likeable / loveable
“ Mike white, you make me want to live longer and I didn’t.” 💔  You never know who is hurting
Love her ❤
God I love this woman so much
I would like to thank the jesuit Hollywood kaazar industrial complex for giving me this role ,it seems like just yesterday that I was playing crying mom number 2 at sandyhook and later crying friend at the pulse night club production. Thank you so much ..
She's outstanding!  So authentic and real.  And naturally funny.  How about hosting SNL????
Love her!
American pie , scary movies, etc.
Im trying to lip read what the uncensored bleeps were hahah anyone? She’s so funny!
She’s my favorite of all time 🫶🏼
FINALLY !
she is naturally funny love her as an actress!
Host was a horrible choice and NOT FUNNY
She is so real for this whole speech...i love u jennifer coolidge wow
Did she hint at being suicidal? That’s nuts
She deserves it all!
She deserves it! Having my cheeks ache from laughter since American Pie!
I adore this woman. ;)
OUR Queen
I love Mike white. I’m a huge survivor fan and was rooting for him when I was younger
Mike White bawling is everything.
Sniffing Jungle Juice while I enjoy this glory.
Love her!!!
ayyy Stifler's mom. I love her.
I need to know who her neighbors are that weren’t inviting her to parties until now because I just wanna talk 😂
I, love Jennifer Coolidge! Glad she won for her role in White Lotus! She deserved it!
OMG! Her character in "Best in Show" along with Jane Lynch made the movie!!!  Thank you Christopher Guest for introducing me to her!
LEGEND!
AMAZING!!!
She is absolutely the best! Hysterical, real, and one of a kind. I am going to miss her in The White Lotus.
STIFFLERS MOM!!!
She is so adorable, humble, funny, real and everything Hollywood needs to be more of! And and I don't know why, but did this make anyone else cry?!?
Little too much talking for my taste
Love her so much
Stiflers mom made it. Congrats
Greatest Milf ever!!!
This is perfections
I have loved her since "the bend and snap". 😂
This woman NEVER disappoints. PERIOD.
i am so obsessed with her it’s sickening
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I’m sure it’s not easy to make it as an actor and I love it when I feel the gratitude from someone who is so thankful. It’s a gift to make films. It’s a gift just to be here. Gratitude is contagious.
This is the best scripted segment on one of these phony award shows ever. Jennifer Coolidge has always been one of the realest and funniest performers so they made the right choice with this spotlight.
ICON
She is a treasure!  Keep that lady employed!
HOLY CRAP ,she's  *ING funny
I love this woman
Forever Stifflers Mom! 👍🏿
Icon. Love her in 2 broke girls
Love Jennifer, she's authentic and so funny - and what a tribute to Mike White - sorry they killed her off in the White Lotus :-(
Glad she won… SN in I loved her in the watch her too ❤
so authentic
Jennifer captures joy and freedom!  Lived a little in the 60's no doubt and caught the groove!!  So happy that Mike White brought her to the mainstream world stage!!  You are my kind of woman, Jennifer!!
Ahhhhh I’m so proud of my mom!! 🥲
i love listening to her
Amazing!
You are the Cooooooooolidge of them all!
It's her year 😌👏
STIFFLER’S MOM!!!! NED SCHNEEBLY!!! BAM!!! Yep, me crying!!
Absolutely love her to pieces.. So humble please bring her back for season 3 White lotus
But she’s not black. This isn’t good.
Thanks to the Hollywood foreign press. You're a bunch of creeps, perverts, and racists but you got this award right.
❤️
Most iconic moment of the night.
Wow she's amazing! I'm glad her neighbors are finally speaking to her and she's invited to all the parties. Lol. 🤩
Worst show ever , who are those people , host not funny .
I love her! Somebody please hire her for another project! Hold the "small roles". ❤🙌🏾
Stifler's mom 👍
She is funny)).. Very good actress.  Deserve to winn. :)
One of my favorite character actors who's usually cast as a "Karen" type, which she plays very well.  Loved her in the mockumentary "Best in Show" and the Amazon Prime show "The Watcher."  I'm glad she's finally getting the recognition and respect she deserves --  congratulations, Jennifer!  :)
So she basically plays herself in the white lotus? Ha love it
That haven't got on her about her weight. I thought everyone in Hollywood had to look like a stick.
Had a huge crush on her as a kid 😭 American Pie messed me up but nah love that for her; she kept WORKING HARD
Who was the wo/man at 4:02?
I love Jennifer Coolidge. She's hysterical. I'll never forget her in Legally Blonde. I'm so glad she finally got the recognition she deserves. Hopefully this will get her a lot more work and she'll be busy for years!!!
She is awesome, maybe she can host next year
I love her 😂❤
STIFFLERS MOM!!!! Epic acceptance speech!!! Where’s ole Finch when you need him???
Amy Schumer could NEVER....
Wonderful!!!
Jennifer Coolidge is hilarious! I'm so proud of her!
I knew Jennifer when she was a waitress and I was the bartender. She would come to work after a fight with her Swedish boyfriend. She would do a Swedish accent. I had to bite my lip not to laugh. She was upset,but she was still funny.  Congrats Jennifer!!!!
she's the best
This speech made me smile and laugh.
She’s absolutely incredible wow
I LOVE HER!
Lovvvvvvveeee herrrrr!!!!!!!
She deserves this
NPCs still watching this cringe garbage?
This winners circle was golden. Angela, Michelle, Jennifer, Ke are icons.
She makes me laugh and she deserves everything that she gets – plus some - she’s great😂
Love love love her
She is very talented. I wish she could speak in complete sentences. It’s exhausting to listen to her.  Congratulations. She deserves this award
she is my favorite  actor ever I love her so much
Take a shot every time she says “you know” 😂
Plays the same character in everything she’s in…. This is kind of insulting
LOVE HER!!❤😆
"You did kill me off!"   Glad I finished S2 before watching this 😂  This was an amazing speech. She's so effortlessly funny.
Gotta love her ! She’s great !
She's great an apparently so is Mike White.
America's first MILF! So deserving!
Oh hey. What's up Kirstie Alley. How's it going.
😭
She needs her own show
👏🏼 👏🏼 🎉 🥳CONGRATS 👏🏼
Legend
I wanna know what was censored!
When she talked about how she was young she had all these dreams and hopes and then life chipped away at her (i was in tears) and then she channeled that into comedy.   She Brilliant!!
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾well deserved
She has always been relevant in my opinion. I like her in 2 Broke Girls she’s in like every episode
We love a Queen
Best Acceptance speech ever.
God I love her!
Everyone likes her because she is REAL.
Lets gooo stiffler’s mom!!
Love her to pieces and it’s emotional for her I’m sure. But good lord hire a writer
She is so beautiful
She’s so cute! I love her 🖤
Well Deserved
Coolest lady in Hollywood, and they really broke the mold with Jennifer.
I really thought she was going to end it with a bend and snap to pick up the trophy.
She always makes me smile ❤
I love her lol 😂
Ryan I need Jennifer AND Sarah Paulson AND Jessica Lange all in one episode of AHS
I ADORE this woman! I have from the very start of her career, and am SO happy to continue to see her in projects!❤
I love her. She’s so funny and amazing!
"even if this is the end because you did kill me off" 😂
People actually still watch this commercial TV crap and the emus pimping auto insurance that goes with it?
LEGEND.
WTF!? The Golden Globes is still a thing?
Well deserved. She's got a unique way of delivering her lines in White Lotus. That scene where she goes "what's his face", with the character's reaction was hilarious.  On a separate note. I'll always be amazed how TV stations in the US are always so concerned about a little swearing (even on a late presentation), but are perfectly ok showing people getting their heads hacked off, in a movie shown in the middle of the day. Go figure.
Deserves it all!
Best highlight of show! 😂🙌🏽❤️
Love her❤️
absolute legend
STIFLER’s MOM!!!!
Nobody watches such crap.. wouldn’t even know most of these tools
Jennifer Coolidge is one of my most favorites, and one of the most underrated actresses, ever. Good for her. She deserves this and MORE!!! Such a hilarious and intelligent womxn. <3 <3 <3
watched it twice :')
I just luv herrr😂❤
God I love her lol. She's so great!
I thought it was Adele 😂
Congratulations, I love what she said about how she was given a few short screen sets; let's see how fast her phone rings!
shes incredible!!
Love this talented lady👏👏👏
Surprised they didn't claim "White Lotus Supremacy".
It’s stiflers mother! She is hot.
Even if itd be the role of Stifler's mom only, you rock as an actress! 👍
stifler's mom.... 👏👏
My queen. ❤
Glad she won 'cuz I love JC.✨
Jennifer Coolidge is the funniest female in Hollywood and it's not even close. Her timing and mannerisms, just everything! She makes me cry laugh.
SPOILIER ALERT!!!!    INCASE ANYONE IS BEHIND ON THE SERIES
Love this lady for years! Always makes me smile. Go, girl! Jennifer Coolidge rocks!!!
She has always been an icon but i’m so happy it seems like there’s a Jennifer Coolidge renaissance and thank GOD she deserves it all
MILF!
I adore her
Love her sooo much ❤
She’s a f*cking legend. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I liked her for years
I can’t tell if I want to laugh or cry but I am obsessed with her.
She is awfully amazing in the White Lotus series.  Well deserved!
shouting out her neighbors inviting her to parties now is the most tanya thing 🤣🤣
How can someone make you laugh and cry at the same time?! Genius!
I bet she never rehearses 😂
my queen
Classic speech.
Hey, it’s Stifler’s mom!!
She has attained icon status like the late, great Betty White.
Love her
Why would they bleep this? So lame.
sumtymes we as human beings need to be reminded how truly beautiful n special we are n jennifer coolidge is nooo different than any of us ladies out there.... it's the unseen faces of how hollywood has treated women n other's over the year's n the highly unattainable "perfections" that aren't alrite n giving us all complexities n real health issues!!... at tymes jennifer doesn't realize how insanity amazing n incredibly talented she, you jennifer coolidge are!! a woman who deserves to be invited to all the parties n chooses not to go but sends the incredible gift basket jus for the invitation.... now that's classy n laying on the floor in sheer laughter n LoVe....  congratulations pretty lady!! 'S2S2'
ICONIC!!!!!!! 😍🥰
Qwayne
Omg, I love her so much.
I remember her all the way back from her small role on "Seinfeld" as the massage therapist Jerry was dating. She has come a long way and worked her butt off. Good for her 👏
Legend
All 5 viewers
Long overdue! She steals every movie she’s in.
Mike White needs to write in a twin sister for Tanya- one she’s never met or known but found out about shortly before going to Sicily. One she impulsively made her sole heir. That poor twin will never get to know Tanya, but visiting White Lotus resorts will help bring her comfort.
Mike White and Jennifer Coolidge are great people!!! Great to see them enjoy their night!!!
So happy she won! After I saw her performance in the 2nd season of White Lotus I was hoping she'd win this award. I never thought of her as a great actress until I started to watch this show, she was truly incredible and for me the highlight of the show.
Iconic! 🥳
This is BRILLIANT! She made the whole night 🙏🏾
I love her!
I can watch and listen to her all day! She is so naturally charismatic!
fire fire fire
She’s amazing! ❤
LOVE her so talented and funny

Stiflers mom😍😍
She's a National F"'n TREASURE‼️  Jennifer Coolidge the iconic LEGEND!

Icon.
Gawd i love her!! You can tell this is a speech she never prepared or anticipated. Its so raw and unrehearsed, its just so real! I love her we all love her! Who can hate this woman?! Like stop!! ❤❤❤❤❤
I love how she realizes her career received a jumpstart and she’s milking it as she should. You can tell when someone is genuinely happy to just have a job and do her craft.
Who? That's Stifler's mom. Stop calling her Jennifer. It's rude
Wow
that’s all you need as an actor, just enough work and support to keep you going until you hit your stride
Love her!
❤❤❤
I think she just booked 5 more jobs ! Lmaooo she’s hilarious!
Who cares!!!!
She's brilliant. What you say when you want to say everything but can't say anything in a timed setting. She's genius! Love this woman
LOVE HER since American Pie and Best in Show
I can Never understand her when she is Talking, Jennifer Coolidge 😂 the ad on Tv is like that DONT KNOW A WORD SHE SAID 😊
she deserved it for “the watcher” too! love her!
STIFFLER’s MOM! ❤❤❤

Claire Danes looks so judgey tho
She will always be stiflers mom!
Love this beautiful lady, God bless you 💕
absolutely love her
Stop worshipping Hollywood celebrities. Good lord no wonder the world and society is in the shape it’s in
I've loved all her work with Christopher Guest, she's spectacular
Happy to see her where she deserves to be. Such a natural 👑
When she put that trophy on the floor. No one has ever done that before. You could hear someone howl in the crowd when she did that. She's loving while at the same time not giving one ample f. Love her, she keeps it real.
FN LOVE HER 💞
Love her! She’s unpredictable, weird, beautiful, & so funny. What was that last thing she said? They bleeped it out, but it didn’t look like she cursed.
So funny I still watch best in show every so often just to see her.
Jennifer is a NATIONAL TREASURE
I cannot stand this woman!
She is in a hilarious film with Mike White called Gentlemen Broncos that most people haven't heard of.  Check it out.
Mike White must be a great guy💖 look at his tears. What a sweetheart.
It’s about time she was recognized I’ve always loved her.
She is incredible. Love her ❤ Congrats 🎉
amazing
She was in 'Click' with Adam Sandler right? lol I love her she is funny as hell
This woman  is really special, I felt it the first time I saw her on Two Broke Women and I thought to myself, WOW!😅😅👀👀🌈🌈😅😅
Jump in the water and climb into the boat
Her acknowledgement as one of the greats is long overdue💖🙏🏾
I really enjoyed her speech, it just felt so raw and real and funny wrapped in one
There is a certain something about her... And the way she does her parts... I’m not exactly sure how to phrase it...
Her little jobs are some of the most iconic characters in film.
Hottie police officer has come a long way.
Congratulations to one of my favorites!!! ❤
just proof that there's no age where your career is "over"
Love her!!! 💜
She's wonderful 🤣👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
She will always be Stiflers mom!!!!!!
LEGEND!!!!!!!!!
After I had seen “Best in Show” it really made realize how intelligent and savvy you have to be in order to play some of her roles, despite the character coming off as oblivious. After watching this she comes off as SO humble too. What a special human. Great season of White Lotus too. Such good writing with soooooo much built up pressure by the end.
Hell yeah, good for her!
She's an awesome woman. She deserves her due congratulations to her.🙌✌️
All the gays-  long time coming!  Loved her since Friends!!
She deserves this award. Congrats Jennifer , your an icon !
Love this woman. Only saw her in the “American Pies” and “Best in Show”. Have to see her in other things.
😂😂😂😂 I absolutely love her!!!! So Hilarious!!! Congratulations!!! This is her year!!! 😍Bravo!!!
That was a genuine thank you. I really love this woman!
happy for her...grats!
I’m glad she knows just how many people love her! She’s just perfect
God I love this woman
She is just good some people just deserve accolades and she is one of them ❤️
beautifully said
Ethyl Merman ?
Icon
So happy she won! So deserving. She certainly gives a colorful speech. I would love to see her do stand up. I know it would be freakin' awesome! Keep going Jennifer. You've got the green light now💃
I’m not crying you’re crying 😭 ❤
Well deserved!!! Love her
She doesnt know how much she is loved. 😖
To tell someone “you make people want to live longer” is such a compliment. Love this woman & Mike white for giving her a chance!🥲
She is amazing.
I LOVE ME SOME JENN 😍😍😍🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 SHE DESERVES IT
Where can I find the complete speech without the dropped audios?
In true Jennifer Coolidge fashion.
She so humble and down to earth
Did anyone actually watch this narcissistic clown show?
She was the highlight of the show.
have loved her for sooo long and very happy for her award.
Stiflers Mom!
Jennifer Coolidge have been underrated for so long.  You deserved this and more.  You are funny, intriguing, eccentric, an a great actress.  You made me fall in love with White Lotus and I own "For Your Consideration" and "Best In show" because of your characters.  Thank you for shouting out Mike White.  He is such an amazing writer and a sweet soul.  I own several of his movies like "The Good Girl" and "Year of the Dog".   He is also underrated as a writer and actor as well but his work has a large fan base and we want to see more from him.  I must say that it was a mistake to kill off Jennifer's character in White Lotus.  She made the series interesting and funny.  We want more of her please.  She is such an interesting and captivating person. I am glad Hollywood recognized what a gem you are.  Congratulation Jennifer!
Don’t have the foggiest idea who she is or why this awards show matters.
Loved her as the handbag maker in Sex And The City. hilarious.
She should’ve had BIGGER ROLES!! But I’m happy she’s finally getting her flowers ❤️
Love her so much!!!
She's a hoot. "Two Broke Girls" show made her famous.
Best speech 😂❤
I love her to bits and pieces and over the moon. Adore 😍❤️❗️🕉️
I fkn love her ❤️
Go Stifler's Mom
Queen
It makes me so so sad to hear that she didn’t want live anymore and was feeling like she didn’t get to achieve all of her dreams in her career. I hope to see much more of her in the next decade!! She is a great actress and a hilarious comedian.
Love her potty mouth.  She is too funny.  Congratulations.❤️❤️❤️🙌🙌🙌
What an incredible human being!  There’s that party question about which famous person you’d want to have dinner with…I finally have my answer.
She has always been an icon to me!!
She has been in the game for so long and it is about time that she got her due!! After she played Stifler's mom in 'American Pie' I would always wonder, where is Jennifer Coolidge? I thought, she's gotta be in the spotlight somewhere, but she was nowhere to be found. I knew she'd take Hollywood one day!! Keep killing it JC!!
Triple love this woman
"This is a FUn night." Jennifer Coolidge. I thought she was seriously going to say, "This makes me want a hot dog REAL bad." 🤦‍♀️🤣❤️
I hated the show 2 Broke Girls but man I loved Sophie! Jennifer Coolidge is that genuine personality you don't see or expect in Hollywood. She's deserved this award for a long time. I love that for how outgoing and funny she is she's never splashed all over social media. Very down to earth and she is grateful to those who got here where she is. She made Mike White cry! By now we all know who she is but she still gives credit where it's due. Such a class act.
I feel her. Hoping we see more of her cause she is hilarious.
Love this woman
We can all agree she makes anything she is in better.
She's amazing
Ms. Coolidge is a Beacon of Light in Hollywood, it is Her Time to Shine!
Just watched her in a Seinfeld rerun after seeing her latest. Glad she is back. Hope she gets lots more roles.
She's a real hoot.
An iconic acceptance speech. Never finishing a sentence and still cracking up everyone in the room.
Spoiler alerts
Lmao she acts just like Tonya in White Lotus
I just love her.
This is how I like my awards speeches: Messy
Man didn’t know she had comedic timing like that. She’s really funny!
The dude in the dress lmao freaks
Idc, Jennifer Coolidge is a treasure. Thee funniest woman ever 😂
Ever since I saw her in the movie Pootie Tang I have been a fan! 100% LOVE TO YOU JENNIFER! 💋
American Pie… milked that to the bone! 🤣
❤️
Jennifer Coolidge is insane. 😂 I don't understand how such a ridiculous stream of conscious ranting can be so damn hilarious. Not having unfunny extended comedy bits allow for off the cuff insanity like this.
She's really funny, and deserves an award.
Love Jennifer Coolidge but can we please stop pretending White Lotus is a limited series.
I live for this woman and these kinda stories
Honestly, a Jennifer Coolidge movie where she is played by Jennifer Lawrence
LOVE. HER. ! Bravo Jennifer! You deserve everything. 👏🍸
She's so funny LOVE her
I hope she knows how much people love and adore her. She is effortlessly funny.
I love her soooo much
She IS THE GOLDEN GLOBES!
queen👸❤
She's really the best!
I'm so happy she won.. cast her in everything thanks 😊
I'm very happy for her! She is amazing ❤️
she's fabulous --- not the most articulate speech but I really enjoy her
YOU KNOW
Pathetic to worship such nasty humans. Everyone in Hollywood is trash dressed in something shiny. It's gross that our country is so obsessed with these mutants.
Love her!! Keep us laughing boo.
She was the only good thing at last nights show
Best speech ever lol
She is an icon and so humble. I hope she realize how recognizable she is and that she is adored. Love Jennifer and her white lotus character was incredible!
The Christmas ad of her that has been running is the most annoying ad in history "bla bla bla blah"
Mike White did not kill you off:  The key word here is:  PRE-QUALS.  Tell him STAR WARS did it---so can you:  TELL  HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mike White did not kill you off:  The key word here is:  PRE-QUALS.  Tell him STAR WARS did it---so can you:  TELL  HIM!!!!!!!

National treasure, PeriodT.  🇺🇸
And this is why people love her. She's hysterically real. Congratulations Jennifer Coolidge~
Love her so much ❤ so deserving
Mike White did not kill you off:  The key word here is:  PRE-QUALS.  Tell him STAR WARS did it---so can you
I can't believe she said she didn't get a lot of work she's one of the funniest women I have ever seen on anything I've seen she is hilarious and everything she does and brilliant she really is this speech just says it all about her none of it was written it's just all whatever had she's brilliant I love her
I adore her just as she is!  A treasure and as someone said, “We need to protect her at all cost!”
I love her!  She's amazing!
T.O.R.T.U.R.E>
Boy you are just torturing them with the fact that you were living poverty level FOR YEARS....until now:  Cringe!  Nails down chalk baord
Did I just see a guy wear an dress?  Pathetic!
Wow she is a true treasure, Tonya I will miss u.  Love how she remembers the little things and now getting her rewards at 61 years young
This is amazing!
She is gold and pure heart!!!
I love her, she is SO AUTHENTIC and GENUINE !!! Well deserved !!!! ('bend and snap' - LOL!! )
Love, love, love her!!!
Luv her‼️🫶🏻 too bad wins awards but they killed her #WhiteLotus character off
Such a genuine person. Definitely a real OG❤
The original MILF and now a Legend
Love her.
TOTAL WOKE GARBAGE CLOWN SHOW!
She's been in the game for years - this is SO well deserved
Her time is NOW!!!!!!!!😂❤😂❤😂❤🎉
She is my absolute favorite!💜 Hilarious!!
Yay to Jennifer!!....but why did you have to spoil season 2 for me!? I haven't finished it. :/
Thoroughly entertaining 👏🏽
Congratulations Stifler’s Mom!!!
ICONIC
Well deserved! Love her. ✨
She deserves it and more! Glad you can get recognized anytime in your life.. keep believing ..
I've watched 147 of these speeches all so that I could see this one!
Stiffler's Mom still hold up!
These comments are fishy as heck ..chatgpt vibes
People speak of Hollywood... others really are in the best way
Jennifer is the real deal! Thank you for being. 🌺👏👏👏👏❣️
I couldn’t stop LAUGHING! We need more Jennifer!!
stifler’s mom
I was waiting for her to say "Oh woww, it's so big and bulbous."
Why doesn’t she have her own show or something Jennifer has always had her quick wit and always been a riot!! She needs more attention!!
The globes broadcast was so fake.  it became a giveaway to correct and or erase their sins of the past. 🤮 also the host was horrible with his crude and unfunny jokes.  🤮🤮🤮
This was the most moving speech they've ever had by far. You could feel the emotions  right with her. So deserving and more of an icon than she even realizes.
I love this woman. More than words. Authentic at its finest. :)
Ned Schneebly!
She is 🔥. She should be what all those bobbleheads in that room should aspire to. Like, "I'll have what she's having..."
I don't get the obsession with this lady. Every time I see her in something she's just playing the same character.
I never heard of her but she was great here and I will try to learn more about her and watch where I can, what a fun and authentic speech.
Idk if anyone on the planet is more naturally hilarious than Coolidge. SO DESERVED. THESE GAYS!!!!!
Jennifer, you are real! Funny, down to earth human being! Watched white lotus bc of you!❤
MIKE 🥹🥹🥹 Thank you for giving Jennifer this role we are all better for it♥️
“I just want to say”, but keeps saying a lot!!!!!
Why is the camera on Ned shneebly so much
I have loved her for so long. I am so glad to see the success she has. She is true to herself and so endearing.
I ❤ Jennifer...she's 💯%.
LOVE THIS!!!
Just want to point out you dudes in the audience wearing dresses make you look absolutely ridiculous.  Dude does not look like a lady.
I love Jennifer Coolidge !
She's freaking amazing as Tanya. Well deserved
Can't fake authenticity. She is a breath of comedy without trying, sweet as can be and just anyone would be grateful to have her in their lives. She deserves everything 👏🏼
Hilarious speech. ICON <3
She's just effortlessly hilarious. Some people try with every ounce of their being to reach a fraction of this and still fall flat.
Happy she’s finally getting the accolades I’ve always thought she deserved. Real deal one of a kind! Congratulations!
She brings a smile to my face and to  my covid weary heart.
Lmao. She is just natural.
She is SUCH a joy. I love her so much. I just wanna hug her.
😭😭😭😭😭😭
WHAT AN ICON! ⭐️❤️❤️⭐️
She left off Best In Show, one of my ALL time favorites.  "I'm just going to be right here until I get another message from myself" while shoveling popcorn.  It's STILL funny!
How did Hollywood miss the mark with this beauty? She should have been leading lady over and over..   Love her.
It breaks my heart to think that she hadn’t made an impact until now. The bend and snap. Best in show. Makes me want a hot dog real bad. She literally has been my life and the key to authentic humor. She is just so engaging and entertaining. Im glad she finally is being recognized on a larger scale.  Congrats!!!
Hollywood 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤮🤢🤢
Absolute gem
She is marvelous. She made a narcissistic,  middle-aged, overweight, and just not very nice character into someone I cared about. I was stunned and horrified when she went overboard and hit her head and drowned.  I am in mourning for Tanya.  There is no way she can come back for season 3. Where has she been all my life?
She is so raw, real and vulnerable...I hope someone is keeping her working to allow her greatness to be seen for a long time
HAHAHAHAAAAA!!!!!!
I freaking lovvveee her and yes it was always the "little" roles but she always shined and now its her time!! You can tell a lot of ppl in the room don't get her humor but this speech was chaotic and funny asf
She deserved this! I want to see more of her, always loved her ❤ this speech was everything
She is so real and charismatic!!’ You can’t help but love her!
I just love her!!!
the BEST
She is DOPE!
Awesome speech, awesome lady
She's a treasure. Cast her in everything, we need to protect her Betty White Style!
A real human in a sea of frauds.
I didn't watch the awards but I'll tune into see Jennifer Coolidge accept an award any day. She's the best!
LOVE HER!
Jennifer s great. Always enjoy her.
She is just one of us. That is why we love her so much....Bravo
My neighbors are speaking to me lol 😅
Give JENNIFER COOLIDGE the WORLD 😭😭😭😭
Give her her flowers! For 20 years she’s been putting a smile on my face; I’ve loved her in everything I’ve seen her in and it’s always refreshing to have her on screen.
Brad Pit was enjoying this lol
such a queen
❤Jennifer❤
Every scene that featured her in both seasons of The White Lotus, she milked every moment. So well deserved.💯
I don’t know why but I just love this woman.
Love her
No one cares
I loved her in a Cinderella story with Hilary duff as Cinderella and Jennifer Coolidge as the evil step mother.
Golden Garbage
Proof these awards are bought and paid for.  While she might be a nice person, she can not act to save her life.
LOVE HER! ❤ She needs her own show! ❤
I love her and don’t need to meet her that speaks volumes
Interesting how the white winners had more time to speak when they accepted their awards but the non-white winners had to wrap it up in a minute and a half.
SHE'S THE BEST...I LOVE HER. ALWAYS HAVE, ALWAYS WILL....MAY SHE KNOW HOW MUCH SHE IS LOVED.
I love her...
Jennifer is literally my childhood… I remember loving all of the roles she played in movies. She’s so funny and above all talented. Has always stayed true to herself and that’s something incredibly rare in the industry. So happy for her!!
There’s been some countless iconic speeches at the Golden Globes throughout the years and I can say with confidence that this right here deserves to be in that pantheon of the very best. Just amazing to be living at the same time as Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White. Her tribute to Mike White was both hilarious and beautifully moving. There’s no better connection than someone telling the world that this person made you want to live longer. I hope Mike somehow resurrects her character or create a new one that once again showcases Jennifer’s talents. Thanks for being you, Jennifer Coolidge.
She is funny. How is she not in more stuff?
Our national treasure!!
The way she bounced off of the boat into the water 😂still has me traumatized
She is a living legend!  Wow!!
I rocks with her hard!!!!!! That’s my chic!
Bend and snap 🎉
Muy bien merecido....Yo adoro su trayectoria artistica y me ha hecho reir muchísimo....👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎
That there can’t be bottled or bought….you either have “it” or you don’t!   Period.
She’s awesome. How fun. You can tell she really means it
I love her❤
I love her !
She's amazing. Truly one of the most genuine & funniest actors I've seen. Disappointed that her character on on White Lotus was killed off, like most I wanted her to transition onto a 3rd series.
She’s the best ❤
She is soo chaotic😹😹😹🥰🥰🥰
Jennifer Coolidge is an icon but I think it's kinda telling that they started playing her off at around the 3 and a half minute mark while they started playing off Michelle Yeoh in the middle of her speech about immigration and struggle at around the 1 and a half minute mark.
One of the most underrated actresses…
She will always be Stiffler's Mum in my eyes! 🤣 Congratulations on the award!
She's great!
Someone is cutting onions in the kitchen 😭
She gets to ramble and Michelle Yeoh gets the music just 2 minutes in? Shame on the producers.
LOVE YOU!!!, Stifflerssss mom. 🤜🤛👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
A freaking legend. Moments like this are so special when they happen.
I absolutely love her!! ❤️😂
I'm so happy for Jennifer! She is awesome and her acting as Tanya in The White Lotus was so entertaining!!!!
Just...THANK GODDESS FOR JENNIFER COOLIDGE. That's all.
Jennifer invited me to sit and have coffee on a sleepy Sunday morning on a gay cruise… a decade ago. At the time she shared the genuinely frustrated life she was having at the time. She is sincere and what you see is just what you get. We both had our insecurities at the time and she was happy to share hers and listen to mine. Her life has rocketed since that time in a most profound way. She might never remember our slow, rambling chat but I definitely remember her. ❤
…. Why?… playing an airhead ditzy blonde is all it takes? There were soooo many better performances on that show. Is it just because she’s been around the longest? Smh
These people can give the most sanctimonious speeches ever, but even though she was fragmented and a little all over the place, she still comes off more genuine than anyone In Hollywood I’ve ever seen. you can just tell she is a genuine person.
Hope we get to see more of her. She is a force of nature.
How about Christopher Guest.  I met her on 9/11 watching  Best at Show over and over to cope.
Some of us love everything you have done.  Perfection....
What's with the close up on Miss Thing, here ??: @3:22
This is maybe the best acceptance speech in history.
White lotus is really awesome this season. She deserved it
LOVE LOVE LOVE HER
JC is everything!!
She deserves the world. And then some.
Hey happy for her👏🏾
What’s not to love about Jennifer?!  So happy for her! ❤
I just love her! ❤
Somebody should make a movie starring Jennifer Coolidge and Olivia Colman, NOW!!!
Adore her!
Im surprised people still watch this garbAge tbh
"Makes me want a hot dog real bad." #Stiflersmom. love, love, love this woman.
She carried the whole night for me she is so Funny naturally like it truly does amaze me how she can pull off simple but effective jokes so easily, I was dying all last night of laughter💀
Jennifer Coolidge and Mike White as a team are destined to be.
I would love to see her on SNL!  Make it happen
Made me cry band laugh at the same time! I love you so much Miss. Coolidge
She will always be Stiflers mom to me.
I adore her perfect and genuine all the time!
This incredibly long speech is not interrupted by piano music suggesting she end, while Michelle Yeoh was called to end her own acceptance speech about halfway through the same amount of time. It would have been nice if both were just allowed to speak — and their respective fans could enjoy the show equally.
Spoilers!
Did anyone else notice it was mostly just the winners in the audience...
She speaks from a place where you can tell she thought her career was over. This is someone who is seeing their dreams come true long after they thought they would. I’m so happy for her, she’s so deserving.
Love this lady! Funny as hell! Well deserved ❤️
Niecy Nash should have won. Jennifer Coolidge is playing herself in The White Lotus.
Love her so much
She’s such an icon!
I wish Jennifer would have hosted the show. I might have laughed a few times then.
She is so funny!
People must be crazy if they wouldn't invite Jennifer to a party! Those people missed out on a great amazing treasure of a human being!
No one talked to me or call me to their party. Audience laughs. I think she was speaking from the heart
She makes everything better. Period. This speech even made my morning better.
Love her 💚☀️💥✊🏿
Love this woman
Mr. Murphy, please put Jennifer Coolidge in the next season of American Horror Story! And thus make it one of the best seasons ever !!!
❤😂🎉amazing 😢♥️
GODDESS
You can call it supporting actress, but she was/IS the STAR.
Love her but damn there’s a spoiler 🤦‍♀️
She is funny!
I love her so much, She is an oddball in the best possible way.
Love her! She needs her own tv show!!!
That speech got her more jobs
You gotta love Jennifer Coolidge!! She is something else and so funny!!
I love her so much.  God bless her.  💕
She's just naturally funny. More power to her.
I love how genuine she is.  Total class plus!!!! I'd listen to her all day
Congratulations to the Original MILF!!! This sweet women deserves every bit of the glory and praise she is receiving ❤
I’m not trying to say anything bad I would never wish this but I wonder if Jennifer Coolidge is sick it looks like she’s wearing a wig. She couldn’t hold a Golden Globe in the mind it’s probably heavy, and Mike White was crying a lot she said at the end of her speech to Mike White he makes someone want to live longer. I don’t know of course I hope I’m wrong and I’m sure I am , i definitely am just seems strange
I’m honestly open to seeing a Zombie Tanya to come back for season 3
Look at the way Brad and Colin were beaming at her. That is how Jennifer makes us all feel. Then look at Andrew, Jessica and Claire during the really poignant parts of her speech. That is also how Jennifer makes us all feel. She truly is a treasure.
She’s a beautiful
Stifler's mom!!!!
MILF!!!!!
The best😭😭🙏🏾🙏🏾💙💙
One of my favorite actors because she is the character!!!
she is hilarious - and probably the hottest star right now.  I hope she gets some great parts.  Would love to hear the unedited version of her speech!
Mike White!!!
Somebody give her her own show.
The genuine article. I adore her
Jennifer is awesome. I work in a bar in New Orleans, where she maintains a home, and she comes in occasionally. She is super down to earth, funny, curses like a sailor, and cool as hell when people recognize her. Pretty cool to see some Hollywood people around, especially when they're as grounded and relatable as Jen. Good for her, super happy for her win tonight!
She is everything.
You're always invited to my party
What were the ryan murphy roles?
She's a treasure. Glad she's finally getting the recognition she has deserved for decades.
She reminds me of my Tia Becky, her twin! 😂 I love them so much…so real, funny and humble. 🥹🫶🏽
That was the best damn acceptance speech ever 👏
Does she know how much we love her?  I hope so.
She's so cool
she 100% deserved this. Much Love Jennifer ❤️❤️
Inspiring.  Never stop until you reach the Top.
A human who respects her journey, I love you JC❤
goddess.  icon.  universal treasure.  beloved. 😘😘😘😘
When speaking about Mike White you can tell that she means the world to him and although she is hysterical, her words are genuine. What an icon. The world needs more of her energy and comedic timing. For this four minute clip, I forgot about all the bad in the world and that is powerful. Congrats Jennifer!
lmao. Gotta love her!
She's such a treasure!
She's all stretched out
She's absolutely glorious. <3
She's a great actress and comedian. I'm so happy for her! 😀
Not one of her neighbors invited her to their parties??? The way she would literally live in my house.
She should have a late night talk show, i would watch every episode
She really needs to host the Oscars one of these days
I loved her in that Hillary Duff  Cinderella-ish movie
She's hysterical.  I remember her for her appearance on Friends.
I fell in love with her when she was on an episode of Friends and stole every scene she was in. Love ya’ Jennifer.
I love her ramblings! They all made sense to me! She just a really incredible lady!
She is Real. I've loved her since 2 Broke Girls... The Best in White Lotus. Bravo Queen.
She wasn't acting in white lotus! I love it!
Such flawless skin too. I'll buy whatever she uses for skincare!
she's having her moment....long over do.
Clare Danes was pressed
Eh...I'll always remember and think of her as Stifler's Mom no matter how many awards she wins!
She's hysterical, and it's all natural. Like a funny teenager. Very adorable.
The first time I noticed her it seemed that she was one of those people that you take a liking to right away.  It's held.  Good on you, Jennifer.
She did not disappoint!
So hilarious and heartfelt. In the spirit of Allison Janney and Dianne Wiest, let's find her a path to the Oscar!
Funniest woman in Hollywood!!!  She needs more starring roles!!!
Best speech ever.
Straight up MILF forever!
So f*n well deserved!
low class trashy woman
That's a life of an actor. It's a struggle. Doing a service  job and constantly auditioning. After American pie her agent should have done a better
3:22  what is that?
Who’s the dude in the dress 🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
She makes my heart swell. Seeing her tear up rushing through how she struggled in her career and Ryan Murphy gave her jobs was so special. She's so humble and grateful and honestly she doesn't even GET how beloved she is, even if she's had more minor roles than major ones in her career. She's so special and iconic and wonderful.
Love her 💖
She is a national icon ❤ Go Jennifer
I cried 😭
She is a true icon.  Has always been and always will be a beacon and one of the best comedic actresses.
I love her, she's great.
I love her so much. She’s humble and funny and just overall amazing !
LONG LIVE THE QUEEN JENNIFER COOLIDGE
Ryan Murphy, Christopher guest , Mike white. But I’ve been a fan of Jennifer’s for over 20 years so I’m glad she’s getting the recognition she deserves
I c o n
Lol 😂 love her !!! Go you !!!
Can’t tell if she’s in character or not 😂
She killed it! Gosh I love her, she deserves it ❤
She was in Legally Blonde and A Cinderella Story. Legend
How can you not Love her for real ❤️
jennifer, these gays are NOT trying to kill you 🥰
Congratulations Jennifer!  The only reason I even started watching White Lotus is because you were in it!  I only watched a few episodes of White Lotus because the story line was akin to watching paint dry!  Wishing you bigger and better projects ahead!
She’s brilliant 😂
…and thats why we love you…😂❤
She's hilarious 😂
Icons of icons, I learned the bend and snap at 5 years old cause of her. Ms. Coolidge, you are one of a kind. ❤
She is a national treasure! Just when I think I couldn’t possibly love her more 😂
I love that woman
She's so freaking great!
I want to see the uncensored one!!
Long overdue! Truly the life of the party. You can tell everyone just enjoys her speech sincerely. Never fails to bring a smile.
I absolutely loved that they gave her the time she deserves.... I was here for all it.... ICON!!!! She is a national treasure. I absolutely love her she made me cry and laugh
Give  this amazing talent her own show... She could be a great late night talk show host!!
Shes a love bug!  She looks beautiful..congratulations Jennifer!
🇨🇳Biden🇨🇳 for Prisonerdent 2023
For those of you that don't watch RuPaul's drag race or maybe you do. They do each season an episode called snatch game modeled after match game. RuPaul will not allow anybody to portray Jennifer Coolidge on the show. It's considered quite the honor to not be allowed to be portrayed. This is how much Jennifer Coolidge has contributed to entertainment.
And this is why we love her ❤
🥦I'm crying!
I think they should’ve had Jennifer Coolidge as the host because I was so disgusted with the host how racist he was a or if they wanted a gentleman they could’ve got Chris rock he would’ve done a better job
Not me watching this 10 times in a roll. And it’s the 11th time, oh who’s counting.
I'm so happy for her!
My queen
Jennifer, you are an American Sweetheart. We love you!
Amazing!!! She’s the best how did we forget about her for so long???
JENNIFER COOLIDGE is the definition of a HARD WORKING ACTRESS
Yes!!
Once again, JENNIFER COOLIDGE steals the show!
Aww that extended shoutout to Mike White and his reaction is just wonderful.
Best moment of the night!
The funniest woman on film. Love her!
Yay to giving people time to give people their flowers. Also, how refreshing that we're turning a corner in the world where men don't think women are invisible as soon as they're past their 40s. She's a gem always and forever.
Jennifer is such a Pop Culture Icon. I love her. She is so funny and cute. She has a great personality and she is pretty.
She is Hilarious!!!!! ❤❤❤ happy for her!!! And love genuinety 🎉🎉
I have loved her since I was a kid and saw her in Legally Blonde. Every time I saw her in something else I loved it too. Finding out she was in White Lotus is what finally got me to watch it. The show is fantastic & she is one of the best parts of it. I'm so glad Mike White wrote this character for her & we got to see so much of her.  I am seriously looking forward to anything she is going to be in!
That was a fantastic speech. Well deserved 👏
Stiflers Mom !
Jesus walked so Jennifer could strut
She has definitely paid her dues, and more.  Congratulations Jennifer!  You are awesome and a great role model that exudes kindness and humbleness. 😊
✨💕💕
Love her, she is so genuine ♡
So happy for her! She’s so genuine, truly deserves to win so many more awards. Go, Jennifer.❤️❤️❤️
"And my neighbors are speaking to me. Things like that." Had me laughing and crying. Love her
She should've hosted the Golden Globes instead of the other guy. He wasn't funny at all, just cringey
I love her!😂❤
The original milf!! Still going strong and rockin it! Well deserved 👏👏👏
A comedic legend!!
Garbage and fake. I don't watch any of Hollywood scripted BS. I don't know why I am being showed this fake garbage
We love Stifler’s mom especially Finch does
She also wins Most Genuine speech!
I want to be Jennifer Coolidge when I grow up!!❤
We need more of her on the screen!
This should be the 1st official viral speech of 2023.
Awesome! She has made me laugh all this time. She deserves this & so much more. Gave her standing o at home.👏👏👏
Love love love this woman!
When you realize Jennifer Coolidge has been playing Jennifer Coolidge the whole time…
*SHE DESERVES IT AND SO MUCH MORE* ❤️‼️
I’m taking the dog, dumb@$$
:)
OMG, she is the best!.... I adore people who are a master of being their authentic self.
I love her🥰😍❤️ Congratulations 🎊  She deserves every award 💜 💖
ICON
Jennifer Coolidge was wonderful, while Regina Hall totally embarrassed herself!
she is so mother
Love her all the way down to the bone. Living legend🤩🥺🥰😍😚
She's Amazing!! She did sooo good in white lotus and everything she's done before that💕💕💕
Mike better find a way to bring her back (twin sister lol)

Well deserved 🫶🏻
Ned scheenbly
I’m ready for her to host SNL
Congrats Stiflers Mom, you killed it on the show and in that dress.
I love her in White Lotus
Claire Danes did not get the set up at all
Loved all her little rolls! Remember her in Frasier? Priceless!  https://youtu.be/0CZWP0jd92A
She’s so charming😊, funny, and natural.  I first saw her in the movies “Best In Show” and “A Mighty Wind😊😊” and she was great in those, so very glad to see her career flourish!
She needs to host SNL!!
She's so right about Mike White. Orange County is a desert island movie for me.
Epic!! 🎉🎉
She is just plain naturally funny which is what sets her apart in the iconic status as a true comedy legend
Love her attitude, so well deserved. She killed it in The White Lotus... So damn good!
I love her!!
Sorry but if you don’t mind https://youtu.be/83EbHwKQmBM
She gave the best speech! She should win an award for that speech.
So well deserved! Her character stole every single scene she was in!
I kept hoping her head would pop out of the water at the end of White Lotus 2.
SO DESERVED !!! SHES MY ACTUAL MOTHER
Jennifer Coolidge is a forever icon 💕
No matter the role, as soon as she comes on screen, she never fails to bring a smile to your face. That's talent.
I Feel U Sis!!
literally the best acceptance speech of all time
The Og milf congrats 🍾
@NBC - she should be hosting these, SNL, etc. Pure gold
She’s so amazing. Love her so much! ❤
the legend, the icon, the moment.
Who else cried when she was talking? I don’t think she knew she was an Icon for 20 years! She made my childhood so much fun. The Bend and snap! She deserve this more than anyone else. She isn’t a sell out. She is Jennifer coolidge !! Love her
All hail the QUEEN! Cast her in whatever she wants! We will all watch.
I love how she drops her schtick and voice, but she's so used to it, that she immediately picks it up again, probably without even meaning to...
That speech was all over the place and i clung on for every second, she is such a treasure and light that only few people appreciated until the White Lotus. Congrats to Coolidge, a seasoned star who just became Americas favorite
Jennifer Coolidge is the Icon this world need.
Well deserved
She was great in the movie me before you.
Can feel her energy here and know  as a viewer..  Between every pause and umm and ahh..we all hear what she's really saying.   Thankyou and I love you.   💟 we love u Jennifer Coolidge.
How is she a supporting actress tho?
*#B** A R Z* 🏆👏👍
Stifler's mom hell yeah😋
One of the legends!
American television is so lame bleeping out the most exciting parts of the speech. Now we'll never know what the audience was laughing at.
Love her. So glad she won.👏💞
Legend receiving her flowers at long last! God love Jennifer Coolidge.
She deserves the world! It feels like the 4th of July!!! 🎉❤
She's so hilarious! Love her! Congratulations!

STIFLERS MOM!!!!!
Love. Her!
This is a genuine human being, absolutely true to the heart, and that's why we love her. She's not doing any "schtick" here whatsoever, and I love it. No political nonsense, just straight from the heart giving and appreciation..
So the advice is this Never stop working!😅👍
"I can put this down, right?"  😂🎖
We love you, Jennifer. She really gives hope to the talented underdogs who get bogged down by life and persevered despite it all. Her heart comes through in everything she does..
I LOVE HERR

Iconic speech
I love this!!!
she is so funny without even trying. just her cadence and realness
Anyone know what her censored words were?
She's a national treasure!
how does she keep winning?! i started watching the white lotus two weeks ago, and her character is so obnoxious. plus she and her character are exactly alike, so it is not like she is putting any effort into it, and people are rewarding that?! i absolutely do not get this at all, though i do not think the show is great overall, either, so clearly i am in the minority. also, thank you for spoiling what happens. :| :| it is not like the episodes have been out for months . . . .
Got to give it to her. She is a 🌟. Happy to see her career grow and thrive. Congrats!
She's great
I wouldn’t mind if she hosted this thing! Lol she’s great!
I really hope she becomes bigger than she already is
Authenticity can't be bought. Love this lady. She's stayed true to herself, rare in Hollywood.
Omg she’s hilarious, amazingly good. Love her
Where do I sign up to be best friends with her?
Congrats to Jennifer! Glad she got her moment in the sun!
It's really cool what joy she brings to so many people. I love how she isn't rehearsed and robotic. She is just being real and human and HILARIOUS. Oh and gorgeous might I add <3 I am happy for her I wish her the best and can't wait to see what she does next

Not a single sentence was finished in this speech, I love it!

Yay Jennifer! Well deserved.
Im CRYING and LAUGHING and CRYING
every time she appeared to falter, she came back with a zinger amazing
Oh, my god.  I love her.  Coolidge doesn't need a script. She's just being herself.  At the Golden Globes, she managed to tell a hilarious story while presenting, then gave a hilarious acceptance speech for her performance in "The White Lotus." My parents and I have been saying, "SHE SHOULD HAVE HOSTED THE SHOW!" We laughed more at the stuff she said than that idiot "comedian" they have hosting cause he's been terrible.  BRING BACK RICKY GERVAIS! So glad she won the Golden Globe.  At first, I thought it was going to Niecy Nash because she was incredible in "Dahmer."  Still glad Coolidge got the award.  She stole both seasons of "The White Lotus."  She's was amazing.
I assume at least 70% of the comments are gays, so I’ll say that she sort of tells stories like Judy Garland
Legend.
Give her all the awards so she can give more speeches!
As usual, Jennifer nails her speech.  This time, she had me tearing up as well as laughing.  Shout out to Mike White for being an amazing writer/director.  Bravo! 🍸
Milf milf milf
She’s an ICON 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Tacky.
The Golden Globe Awards 🌎🏆 was fantastic tonight. Congratulations for the people that won an award. Congratulations for the people that didn't get an award. It's not about wining an award. It's about working hard to get here tonight. Therefore. Congratulations to everyone.
OMG I LOVE HER. LOL SHE DESERVES EVERY ACCOLADE... <3
Can we get her a SNL episode, or better yet her own standup show. She is everything!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this woman
She’s amazing. Mike White is amazing. If you enjoyed the White Lotus please watch his other (earlier) show Enlightened—quick watch and also incredible.
She is so good in everything she does lol
Love her!! The best. Mike White bring her back to White Lotus some how !!!!!!! Make Jennifer happy and us!!!!!!

Omg if there is someone who deserved that award tonight it’s Jennifer Coolidge.. she was fuckin fantastic on The White Lotus. . . 👸🏼 🏆 Spoiler alert …..     I’m so incredibly sad that she dies on season two but I look forward to seeing her get more awesome opportunities on great films and series for her!! Well done Jennifer!! 👏👏👏👏
