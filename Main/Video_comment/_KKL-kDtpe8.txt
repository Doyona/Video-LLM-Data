Right foot step right foot step right foot step😂😂
I have a bottle of  prime lol😂
Even the word “trend” reminds me of my grandma.., I might be getting old etc.., But it’s nice too know that English is going backwards and we’re all better for it.., If it’s “trendy” it basically means it’s a fad that’ll be gone in a year or so…, Trends used too be a word associated with style/fashion/movements.., That word has disintegrated and it’s very sad whatever your doing.., Make a new word for it because I can’t even define you people even with help from a dictionary anymore
Hogwarts legacy
The fake british accent is so annoying fr.

Fortnite's been out since the PlayStation 1 and even earlier I think....
its the parents and teachers when they are trying to be trendy, they do the dab and then i tell them that its like 7 years old and they say that was quite recent. Hello, fucking 7 years ago
He still hasn't found out about vaping yet
Godam skibidi toilet
Damn it, it’s me… I’m like 1-6 years late on everything
i genuinely just had Squid Game spoiled by this video AHJAHAHAH

As a fat kid that plays fortnite and drinks prime while hitting the griddy, this video is offensive.
me when my mates dont metion theses trends to me 😠
"you are more late than a sluts period" holy shit lmao that was too good
Shak hitting the Griddy was the funniest shit
😂😁🤣 "Where have you been North Korea?" I thought most electronic games were invented in Asia,same as fortnite too.... "Late as a s#-@ period" 😆 I thought "delayed menstrual cycles for menopausal &/or PCOS"  but with technology inventing new things all the time you can possibly expect therefore more than 1 monthly 👾🎮🕹️
This hits home 🤣
Recently my mum asked me in amazement if I know what Google lense is
“Right foot step right foot step, pull this off in a club, I guarantee you your getting laid” 💀 💀
