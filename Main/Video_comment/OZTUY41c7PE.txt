Based on true events
I demand a sequel to this for when Metroid Prime 4 releases.
Me when I Finally able to watch Ruby Gilman with my brother before I think about my true feelings about that movie…:
Came back here 4 years later....
No joke, my brother's PS4 sounds like this and it scared the sh!t out of me.
My birthday is on December 10
Fantastic 👍👍👍😎
"Im done waiting!" I love the delivery of this line SO MUCH.
am I the only one who thought he was the serial killer from sponge bob
*loads video* "Hey kid, wanna see a dead body?"
What happens if you open the game:💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
You need to start writing anime
The ps4 was too based
No
Ps
o7
" i've been waiting for this my whole life" lmao this so literal because this game has been known to be in development through out the whole time of the ps4's lifespan.
that's a volatile substance base ps4 was holding right there. HIGHLY REACTIVE
December 10 is my birthday
I thought it was going to cut to a 5 hour long update file downloading
☠️😻☠️
PS 4 see you in the other side 😇🪦⚰️😵☠️. After the explosion 💥   pringus : he is dead if i know this will happen i could. Save him 😢💔😭😭😭 why I was so stupid how I couldn't realise that he is waiting for this game all this time I couldn't rescue him I 'm sorry PS4 😭💔
This look like bfdi
This makes me emotional because the Base PS4 was the first console I bought with my own money.
I finished Cyberpunk on base ps4
The game crashed!
Is this a joke I am too PC Master Race to understand?
PS4: It's finally here... My brain: PERFORMING FOR YOU
Yea this game really got me upset
PS5: this is why we upgrades are better Me: can you play ps3 discs ps5? PS5 …  …  …  Ya like PS Now Me: NO PS5: :(
o7
After nine years in developement, hopefully it will have been worth the wait
Ohhh thats his eyes.. I thought its a bra or something..
man cyberpunk  2077 fucked my pc😭😭😭
de ps 5 is waet
That ps4 voice is amazing could probably be used for a side villain like Star scream
Not only did the PS4 die because the game is garbage but from the overwhelming amount of transphobia in the game.
Where is this audio based on? It feels like the PS4 audio was taken from a movie or something.
My mom asked me what movie I was watching lmao
2 days after my birthday
The game is too powerful. Even the console exploding is glitchy.
He looks like diet version of ry mckeand.
This aged well
2 years later and things are fixed I think?
This was my bday in 2020
Why is there so many animators that just happen to be really good voice actors as well?
One way ticket to the afterlife.
hey pringus. if this isn't ask to much, can you make a video of beyblade burst on your animation? PLEASE???
Goes to store 2 years later   Hey kid Ps5:who are you? Him: I am just a guy Ps5: where are my parents? Him: they, are gone Ps5: w-what? Him: I am sorry but they're gone Ps5: (hugs) Him: You wanna live with me? Ps5: y-yea Him: (chuckles) Ps5: What? Him: lets go home, ps5
I play on PS5 now so it's all good.
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ps4 pro gang
Thats my birthday
that ps4 bout to be my ps3 after i install webmanmod
When the PS4 said "I'M DONE WAITING", I thought it sounded like Bill Cipher. Also the "See you on the other side, kid" made my heart break. I would be sad if the video game console I treasured most decided to destroy itself, just for one game. I can already imagine my PC in flames... 😭
Suicide is not a joke guys! Making jokes about poor Base PS4 and his family, you should be ashamed of yourselves!
What effect did you use for the PS4 voice?
Imagine ur watching this on ur ps4
Ps 84 calm down and let's have  some candy or a soda
PS4 Is like me in the nutshell if upcoming Nintendo Direct got news of first look of Mario movie reveal... P.S...Just Give us something...
So good!
PS4 больше не будут выпускать, через Cyberpunk2077 или через новую консоль PS4
OK but for real though why does this man have such a badass action hero anime protag voice?
See ya on the other side kid.
Never had any issue with my base PS4 playing that trash heap
F
Anyone else notice the comment section won't load sometimes?
Epic
Aint no way, december 10 is my birthday!!!
Holy...sh*t That was a story about a ps4 who had been waiting his whole life to have 1 game knowing it would destroy him, and he didn't care, meaning he had a death wish and knew that was the game for it...that's *dark*
Sad eh jeh
It's sad that it still sucks too.
The game is laggy cuz it's rushed as everybody rushed them to make it so without any chance of it being updated yet you can say the entire fandom fucked up
“It’s finally here” that little ps4 didn’t know what they were getting themselves into .
noooooooooooooooooo ps4 ;-;
Fallout 76 would been just as deadly
ok, Mr.Mcdingus should be an anime voice actor
Kabooms 1:10
Ps4 has... timed out😭😭😭
Lmao
Heath Ledger's Jokers theme ramps up in the background
Rip
That sound is the PS4 fans trying to cope with such a disaster. Hopefully one day cyberpunk will be what we were promised
Like me, kids would hate it when there parents do that
Not cyberpunk 2077 that would bomb is happening (fallout joke)
Between the Elden Ring ending and this, I love the smooth transition to BIOS and loading screens.
PS4:ahh yes I’ve been waiting for this my entire life
I prefer ps4 more than ps5
The ps4 sounds a lot like stars ream nice
I had to come back to this classic once again
Xbox dies
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣True
No wonder it exploded. He tried to play it without the data disc.
What was the game?
...I was expecting it to catch fire, didn't expect _bluescreen_
A year ago already? I remember when it came out
Can we just appreciate the voice acting here for a second? Sure this might be short, but I really like the voicing in this animation… it really gives off more life in these short and stupid videos…
That night shit gone done
You mean this happened on my brithday
We gather here today in memory of Base PS4, does anyone have something they would like to say?
PS5: I miss em PS1: Yeah.. PS3: we can't turn back time, we can only move forward PS2: *buries PS4*       PS4: *wakes up* what the fu-
Why does the ps4 look like Battle for Dream Island! Look it up
PS4 AND PS5
PS4: And this… IS TO GO… EVEN FURTHER BEYOND! *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
Up until now I thought he was saying “based ps4”
MY BIRTHDAY
He got what he wanted.. but at what cost..
Gosh has it seriously been a year since this happened? This year just flew by.
Its now the 11th i survive another year
Hmmm
Worst 18th birthday present I thought would be my favorite
Did your PS4 actually explode when you put that game in?
pringus:lets just wait base ps4:I'M DONE WAITING
Fun fact: december 10 is my birthday
Fun fact:My birthday is on 10th of December
This is exactly how my PS4 went down. I couldn't stop it.
The title of the video is my birthday.
Fun fact: this was made on my b-day
1:19 noooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!
dec 10 is my b-day
Just so you know FYI I’m not a YouTuber troll or a hater I’m just a friend of yours and others on the YouTube channel
Everyone after Sora was announced for smash, on the 18th. (Myself included.👀) “He’s out… he’s finally here!! After all this time… He’s finally here! …I’ve been waiting for this moment, my whole life!”   The crash at the end is the poor online servers when everyone spam plays him day one. Or rather, when everyone all tries to buy/download the dlc at once.
Ps4 когда вышел ps5
Spiderman chills
Lovely this was a day before my birthday
Cold War, should've known
Reminds me of half life 2 on the original Xbox.  Both are funny
*Series X:* What are you talking about 😎
😏Look on the bright side dude now you can get yourself a PlayStation five (the newest console)
Guess I got lucky with my copy. Error screen didn't show up until the end credits of my first playthrough. Honestly my copy had the least amount of bugs. And yes, I used a base PS4. All I needed was a hard drive plugged in so I could have a save file.
0/10, not enough tortured fan noises
this is my birthday, except for the year
Funny, that's my Birthday..
I played on PS5 Day 1 and the game crashed 17 times before I finished it.
The voice acting in this is great
And that's the story of how the most deadly weapon was made
Ps4 is very based
Pov the ps4 died
I just bought this game, hadn't opened it yet...  Then THIS slides into my recommendations
An error has occurred in the following application:  (CE–34878–0) Cyberpunk 2077  Checking the error status. . .  0%
Chippin' in with my PS4 😂😂😂
he warned ps4 but now he crashed
December 22 2077: the “game breaking” incident
F ps4
Lol how the hell did base ps4 survive RDR2? Or spiderman ps4 XD
The 9 december us My birthday
My 2013 Xbox one is no pushover, it can run Kerbal space program without any major problems. Sure the frames dip, but what's it matter in the long run?  But this  This is much worse
Fullmetal jacket?
why is he saying base ps4, like PS4 pro? because I have a PS4 and I still have the same problem lol
I’m getting rid of mine this March I’m platniuming the kingdom hearts series
Yes me to
It is half-life 3 on my pc 😆
its funny that i watched this on my ps4 and i thought youtube crashed :/
PS4 NOOO!! Why u do this!
Loved "I've been waiting for this game my whole life." Very accurate, yet ominous.
base ps4 sounds.. like something new
That's why you get Xbox
Canon:Pringus lives with the living versions of every console ever
you are 18 days late
Sounds like a jojo English VA
that day was my birthday
PS4+cyberpunk 2777=expollosion
Aw did you sleep well? Did it help with da blah? Also bruh apparently there were preorders this entire time and I didn't get it lol. But it's okay cus the preorders sold out in actually minutes (not exaggerating) so I couldn't have gotten it anyway. Hopefully they restock a bunch before it comes out.
PS4: I’ve been waiting for this my entire life. So Cyberpunk and Cuphead?
Cyberpunk is polish game
All wat i can say it's......                                Слава украине🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
I'M done WAITING!!! OH. MY. GOSH! IT'S TOO... Familiar😔. From which one is it??
Nobody: Literally no one: Automatic subtitles at the end: you
My birthday
based ps4
He do he lookin like amoogis
Somehow my base PS4 from late 2015 (mid-October) has only ever had 1-3 overheatings, but you can hear it wishing for death if i run Rdr 2, TLOU 2, or Ghost Of Tsushima (it can take Ghost of Tsushima for 1-2 hours before the turbine "goes critical"
I remember what happend in december PS4 Just wanted cyberpunk 2077 (God that game is a copy of GTA but futuristic) Anyway, and it just PS4 goes crazy and just release the game immediately ps4 have no wait to release the cyberpunk game and is just bad
10h of December is my birthday
Haha,  I don’t get it.
Base ps5
Funny fact:the 2077 in cyberpunk 2077 is the year it was supposed to come out
i can't wait for the ps6 which can run rl craft on 3000 chunks with shaders an maxiumum graphics
*CYBERPUNK 2077 INTRO SONG*
I was expecting a 13 inch dong joke.
*Inserts* NUKES bsod
My ps4 kinda start to smell like burn plastic when l done installed cyberpunk 2077
I'm about to put the disc in
When the vilan dies from power:
You know I thought the title was referring to the Game Awards something like TLOu2, but uh  This was a lot more saddening
F
What's the reference? I mean the short storyline of the animation.
Me: *playing a racing game and winning in a race* Ps4 Error: *IM BOUT TO END THIS MAN WHOLE CAREER*
This explains why we are all dead inside :D!
Noooooooo P S 4
Ps4 digivolve to!!
I'm uh, I'm gonna go hug my PS4 now.
People who bought the game day 1: "We can't play, there are too many bugs." Bethesda fans: "Not a bad game."
This is how I feel about waiting for a ps5
He went out in a blaze of glory. We should all hope to be that lucky
Good plot.
BRUH when the explosion right when it exploded YOUTUBE CRASHED
Base ps4? Base ps4!!!
Based PS4?
and thats why they should of waited to release the ps5 and then release cyberpunk 2077
"Boom."
:( :| :) It is out... Now it's time to GAME ON AND TAKE OVER GAMING AND DESTROY EVERYTHING! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
I thought my computer crashed at 1:14 lol.
That's why i like xbox more
December, 10th 2020: The Cyberpunk2077 incident.

Hey December 10 is my birthday.
Dang this is kinda sad

Rest in peace, Base PS4.
Top 10 world destruction scenes

My Xbox one sounds pretty normal...so like... *now im afraid of PS4.*
December 10 2020, the “cyberpunk incident”
Poor base ps4. Never stood a chance. Even a decked out PC has trouble running it.
I like the animation
Wake the fuck up samurai, we have a city to burn😎
F
The more I think about it, Cyberpunk 2077 was pretty much more optimised for the 9th gen consoles (Switch, Series X and PS5).
Why did he use it knowing he would die bruh lol
The loud build up noise sound effect was actually just the fan of the ps4
this was my birthday, weird
Boom boom boom! I can't stop singin' this bloody tune tune tune!
Please wait its Christmas Its December 10th
And it died
I thought it is ukraine at first
Plot twist:it exploded because there was already a disc in it
OH GOD THATS MY BIRTHDAY
I felt this
Damn.. that ending was masturful
Haha ps4 go boom
PS4 you truly cannot handle that power
December 10th 2020, “The Cyberpunk 2077 incident.”
Thats what happens when you play a game released in 2020 on a 2013 console
Hey what's the music used in this? Just curious.
Very true
why do you sound like a tutorial quest NPC
Me: owns an Xbox  Hehe shit still work
Meanwhile a slightly above average PC Runs Cyberpunk 2077: "Dafaq!?!? ARGH!!!!!! THE GLITCHES! THE HORRIBLE GLITCHES!!! MY SSD! MY VIDEO CARD!!! MY CPU!!! EVERY CORE IS ON FIRE!!!!! UNINSTALL!!! UN...INSTALL!!!!"
Based?
*P e e ES F 0 R* Lost it man
Does anyone have a PS5 yet
Way better than CyberPunk2077
I've been waiting for this... Gay?
What is this based on... I know this line from something
PS4’s voice reminds me of Starscream from Transformers Animated when he yells at that one moment
“Do you ever wonder if god stays in heaven because he to fears what he has created?”-Steve bushemi, 2001
"An error has occurred in the following application"  why does this keep happening?
Well this is a good reason to buy a PS5.
The power is too good
anime
This shouldn't have been funny AT ALL!
Here is an unpopular opinion, I actually like cyberpunk
If you don’t get it: Cyberpunk looks terrible on ps4
Poor PS4. He got lagged to death
That game become quickly popular as soon as forgotten....
This should’ve been the ending for an anime
Cyberpunk 2077 took 10 years to make
wtf is this
I love your channel its funny
LMAO
You know my birthday?
And error has occurred in the following application: *A N I M A T I O N*
accurate
This is so sad
Base PS4. Thanks for specifying
and the ps5 was born
error :3 👌
Dude had a whole DMC5 “I’m not letting you die.”
This is why I never got into Cyberpunk 2077
What uhhh, what you got there buddy? *ALL THE OTHER KIDS WITH THE PUMPED UP KICKS*
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

I got the Black Ops III one. Is that the 2nd version of the base PS4? The one without YLOD risk?
*BASE PS4?!*
I have to call my PS4: hey, PS4 slim gran turismo limited edition? Where are ya?
BFB limbs
So true
when base ps4 said its finally here  i said preforming for you
This hit me harder than it shouldve
Is he saying base ps4?
My birthday is December 10.
That’s not a ps4, that’s a Samsung note!
Jokes on you this was released on March 28th
What the f¤○k up gamer. We've got a PS4 to burn.
Sounds just like a train crash.
Did he just make an entire 1:20 minute long animation based off of his game crashing?
ummmm reee?
You've actually got a pretty good voice man.
I never cared about cyberpunk
Based on a true story
"I've waited my whole life for this game"  We all did
That day os mu birthday
Some don't actually get bricked
That "I'M DONE WAITING" felt so real man
Feels like i watch someone commit sodoku
wake the fuck up, samurai. we’ve got a console to burn
BASED on true events
I just realized Pringus has a sweater and not a t-shirt and now I'm so confused and I feel like my brain is going to explode and I probably unlocked super saiyan and my third eye or something and I think I found out the cure to cancer it's just blasting Flower Garden at full volume into someone's ear.
Oh no Oh no Oh no no no no no
Oh gosh the glitches the bugs the false promises yuck and not to mention the dramatic music starts playing the subpar story
Bloodrop connects ps4 for REVENGE
I love it all the music the voices everything
And.... my birthday is a meme now....
They promised me so much...
december 10 is my birthday
In 2077 your ps4 can be bricked
saddest anime death
Same
Sometime after he gets a PS5 but they’re all sold out
How consoles commit suicide
My PS4 after cyberpunk2077 comes out even though I never use it
Oh look Lois this box's hair/ weird eyes looks kind of like my Chin- oh wait it exploded I wonder why ._.
I keep forgetting this actually came out
December 10 2021: ps5 can I play on you- why do you have every Pokémon- NO DONT
He went to hell, before he died
These limbs on ps4 seem familiar.
The thing he is wearing looks like a green version of the ps5
Expected giornos theme at 1:13 ngl😂
I got the game on xbox one in december and waited until February to actually play it.

A little too old to be giving flowers to someone you ONLY admire eh?
Why is the ps4 wearing a bra on the top?
Is that what you call the model 1 ps4
Ay I think the ps4 is bill cipher
Rest in Piece Ps4
it took me 3 months to notice he is saying "base ps4" and not "based ps4"
That’s why I use Ninten... the software closed due to an error.
I thoroughly enjoyed that, quality content 👌
I really wish at the end it was just pringus on the couch like dammit again
Yo did anybody tell you that your voice acting sounds great, because your voice acting sounds great.

Top 10 Saddest Anime Deaths

PS4: MY PRECIOUS  idk why he tried to stop him cuz im not a console person
This guy reminds me of hotdiggydog
This.... was.... intense. 😭 Rip ps4
Why did u put so much effort into this, I’m not complaining but still...
I dont get it...
XD
Why do they even put it on PS4 in the first place they knew it had problems yeah let's put it on the much less powerful hardware that'll go well
Parappa the Rapper
Not just a base PS4 issue, I had the same recurring issue on PS5.
your posing is phenomenal. The leap at 1:07 had me in awe.
PS4: you took everything from me. PS5: I don’t even know who you are.
Me When Sees Cyberpunk 2077: (Cyberpunk 2077 Theme Plays) This Reminds Me Of Somthing But... (RULE 34 RULE 34 RULE 34 RULE 34 RULE 34 RULE 34 RULE 34) (Other Me) ITS FRICKEN FURRY PO*N!
I hope they pull a NMS and fix the shit out of it
If it wasn't true it wouldn't be funny either 🤣🤣🤣🤣
What game was it
The day of 2077 the future
I love how the caps says "Bass 4"
they really got to get that game fixed, if they want to continue making money
1:12
I knew Spongebob was always relevant.
This should be the intro of the game, to be honest.
PS3..Is That You?
F
I cleaned out my friends ps4 with a can of duster. The fans went from sounding like a Kuznetsov NK-12 at full tilt to sounding still sounding like one but at slightly lower throttle.
It’s finally here       Performing for you
This is what my base xbox is like with all my new games this year.
truly a based ps4
I was expecting PS4 to shove the disc into its "mouth"
When this came out my birthday was 10 days ago
Lol. I was expecting a situation similar to this, but not as bad as it turned out... like, hell, they needed a GTX 1080Ti to run a preview of the game at 1080p 30FPS, it was obvious that a console that is about one eighth as powerful as that wouldn’t be able to run it properly.
R.I.P ps4
PS4 DONF DO IT NOOOKOOOOOO Anyways xbox how u doing oh he's ded to
Well that went from a 1 to a 100 *VERY* quickly
Misheard "Best PS4"
Thats my birthday!
Plot twist: He had been playing Katherine Fullbody prior to this and the PS4 went mad.
Lol the ps4 has eyes xDDDD
This didn’t age well. He died for nothing
I saw cyberpunk 2077 and i was like “THATS SUICIDE O HELL NAH”
*trumpet of salute song play*  In the memories of Base PS4.
Why did this make me tear up for base ps4
If you think that creepy sense like it’s like one of those jump scares the movies and everyone goes screaming with that happens so I was prepared for that bravo man bravo with that you almost made me get a jump scare bravo 👏 by the way your videos are awesome
Pyra's Up B hit harder than Sakurai demonstrated.
PlayStation: the anime
Dang that was really deep
Where did you find my base PS4? And I played Cyberpunk DOR on it, it was atrocious
His final form...when will ps4 be done
I am starting to notice a trend.   PS Glitches: break game or graphics Nintendo Glitches: make games exploitable and funner
0:36 ...Preforming for you, if you know the words, you can join into, Put yo-
epic sad:(
Bfdi
I won't forget what ps4 did with pt and driveclub...
When you walk away...

So true
It’s starting to spread! Now Xbox is getting ahold of it
Everyone's talking about the ps4 but not that chad voice
Plot twist: the music is the PS4's increasing fan volume
The new ps5 with less suicidal rates!
Dude get ps5

Base PS4 didn’t do Data disc first, did he.
Sorry
Its should be its finnaly here..........................THE PS5 IS FINNALY HERR

He lagged so much he couldn't even blow up right
*original joke about ps4 fans*
Damn, The Last Stand of the Gunslinger looks weird.

Jajajaja no se inglés
Mine already sounds like a jet engine trying to run Ghost of Tsushima. (Or pretty much any game with good graphics) So this seems pretty accurate.

Cyberpunk is a drug                                                                                                                        .......to the ps4
For Xbox it would just freeze and take you to Home Screen with no explanation as to what happened, it lets you guess why it crashed
I was ready for a jojo reference in the end 😩
I wonder how Xbox One is doing with Halo Infinite
The fact the explosion lags XD
Base PS4 out here sounding like Gray Fox

I like the end because i have a ps4 and my Minecraft crashes alot
Then it lift of by its fans
The ps4 can burn, like how are you worse than the the second generation.
I was expecting a "You know you won't be able to handle it!"
I was lucky I could return it, also I was glad I got news from IGN about the problems of the game before I could even open it
I keep on repeating the video just because I like ps4's voice.

I have an original PS4 and Cyberpunk and I'm doing just fine. I have harnessed the power of the glitch.
What would the graphics look like on the Dreamcast 🤔
Why you didn't write a title
😂😂
Base PS4: I have been waiting my whole life for this game! For so long, I had waited...delay after delay, year after year. Its my God given destiny! This game was promised to me from the start! Before all other consoles, I was there, it is my birthright.  Owner: But, you'll die because of it! Its not worth it!  Base PS4: Then so be it...
Hey I love your animations, I'm definitely turning the bell notification on. Thanks for the great content.

I actually tried this on my ps4 it ran pretty well actually.
Gotta be honest, when I first saw this I was expecting a SpongeBob reference. "I CAUGHT THE UGLY!"

The tragic sub-meaning of this video tells the story of how Cyberpunk is a metaphor for death, PS4 desperately trying to accept it knowing he will soon be replaced by PS5. He’s not ignorant to the dangers of the game, as shown by how he tells Pringus he will see him on the other side. In truth, PS4 wants to go out with a bang, (that bang of course being Cuberpunk ) before the day comes when he is replaced. Truly a tragic story
Possible interpretation of PS4's personification tactic: Blank Eyes - This possibly means that PS4 is a machine, not designed to have life. Here, it's Gold Experience'd Where's the Mouth? - The blue line's curvature matches its expression. See 0:16 and 0:52 for the differences.

its supposed to be on the ps5
Instead of saying "See ya on the other side", It would have been a cool nod to say "See you in the major leagues, kid" even if it doesn't make much sense.
huh
I have that error every time i play hunter call of the wild on my Ps4 Pro
Oh I see the problem, you bought the regular version and not the ps4 pro or slim
For a minute I thought the song in the background was "Why so serious" from The Dark Knight OST and honestly that would have made this even better lol
I have the ps4
this is why you should just wait until its easier to get a PS5
graphics quality: "potato"

I literally thought that the PS4 was just holding the Miles Morales game lmao

Imagine having enough money for a PS4 let alone a PS5(truthfully tho I prefer Xbox Series X)

oh my lord the graphics is so bad eject it!
Dude I'm playing it on slim.
Tell me what is going on here
Ha
Its funny how u bought cyberpunk that day and had no problems on my base ps4 until I was like 5 hours in
“I’ve been waiting for this my whole life” literally
I know this was a joke on cyberpunk, but that was more intense than I thought it was.

Top 10 sadist anime deaths
so cyberpunk 2077 is just a form of suicide for ps4 so when the ps4 is depressed af and wants to die *plop* that shit in and *NUCLEAR SIREN GOES OFF*
it would've been funnier if he messed up putting it in the disc space
Is that your voices
So
that was a day before my birthday
Xbox one do the same thing

But PS4 isn't backwards compatible with PS2 games tho. 🤔

The Sound in the Background reminds me of my ps4 Starting up the game
PS4 did it so PS5 can't bully him about his superiority
dude my Xbox one s can rune this game perfectly
ittl take until 2077 for the ps4 to handle cyberpunk 2077
Instead of playing an anti gamer game why not play crash bandicoot 4
I like this cool new business practice where new gen ports are used to brick old gen hardware. Now that's pretty cyberpunk!
0:00-0:27 Is that a spongebob reference?
damn RIP ps4
December 10 2020 but published December 28 2020
Cool, but why tf do you have an anime voice?
This is why you get an Xbox cuz this won't happen to it and we got some good games I'm not saying PS4 doesn't have good ones there are some good games but not a lot and we don't have mistakes like cyberpunk 2077

PS3 died waiting for Cyberpunk, and by the time Cyberpunk came out, PS5 was already stepping up to take the PlayStation throne. PS4 has waited it's entire life to play this game, and when it finally came out, it was already too late. The game is too powerful for even PS4. This is so sad
Press F in chat for base PS4
Cool animation
Base PS4 already sounded like a trains  engine while playing Knack.
Ah yes, my favorite anime: "My room mate is a PS4"
He was a great bass
December 10th was my 18th birthday :-)
That's some pretty good animation and voice acting to go with it. 👏

Dang, and to think that day my sister turned from 4 to 5
Cyberpunk is the most overhyped, underwhelming and broken game in history.
uh oh
Bruh youtube crashed at the end lol
Base PS4?         becomes based ps4
Probably gonna port cyberpunk to ps5 anyway and then crash the ps5
This is real                I played it 4 - 6 hour, and it crashed 2 times
So it was worth the wait then.

I thought this was going to be a Cyberpunk parody, not a tragedy B(
I had to wait 3 days for it to download so I could play....I still love it
aw hell naw he died
Last video I saw in 2020.
Heh I pl0y on Xboydbex bro I’m so gnarly
Play honestly have no idea what's going on.
Can confirm; that's how it went down
F
The repeated noises at the end almost sounded like the jackhammer from the old Fredarator credits.
PS4 has breached containment OH NO
My birthday is on December 10th
Okay why is this so good and why do I want more
As a console peasant that doesn't have a ps5 I cannot play this game
January 1, 2021
When you insert a next gen game into your last gen system.
I'm going to play this 1:10 to 2021 so that way at 1:10 at midnight, 2021 would start with a bang
Sadness, but happines
Good thing I don’t have cyber punk on mine
December 31, 2020
Janurary 1st, 2021
That rising music was actually just Base PS4 starting up
Rest in peace basic PS4 who am I kidding I'm an Xbox and Nintendo fan enjoy hell Sony
Also my birthday
I dont even even have a Ps3.
Uh, I think something happened.
Dude thats my bday!
Anyone else gonna talk about how the light bar makes him more expressive?
Hahahahaqhgagahahaahahahahah  Shameless object show character joke
That console went out doing what he loved. No regrets.
Voice reveal?
Its so true
What's so good about cyberpunk
Personally I do think Cyberpunk has too many bugs and glitches that makes it a mess but it doesn’t ruin the game all together. What ruins it is the random crashing but all games have this weird thing on the PS4 for crashing at random. I like the game but just needs fixing which CD PROJEKT RED is doing. They even offered refunds for how poorly it went. Many companies would just say fuck it and just take the money. You don’t have to like the game but let’s at least give it some time. I’m waiting til February to play it again when the patches get released. Remember that the company also made 2015 GOTY The Wither 3:Wild Hunt so they can be trustworthy. I hope...
The whir in the background is the PS4 fan
Doesn’t it run worse on base xbox one?
I hear PissFour
Suicide mission
Too bad the base PS4 looked the best out of all the PS4 versions
PS4: my time has come Gamers: noooooo
hey the captions finally got it right
I don't
*My birthday is on December 10th*
LMFAO
"i've waiting for this gay"
The PS4 looks like a BFDI Character on crack
The PS4 did that because the PS5 came out.
Went up in flames just like Arasaka Tower, damn Johnny's been busy.
Yeah  Tell that to ps vr
death
ok
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO PS4
No to much Ray tracing he can't handle
I thought PS4 was crying
the title is not upload date???
monke appears on 1:13
The fans will spin so fast it will start a fire
base ps4 sounds like based Alad V.
TBH what did everyone expect with a intense game like that running on 9 or even 10 year old technology
Dude, the first time I watched this all the way through, I was on the PS4...   Do you KNOW how panicked I was? Like 2077 is so bad l, it wrecks your game console a video away
It was so bad they removed it from the ps4 and others
"Based PS4? Based PS4?"
o h   n o
xbox gamers: imagine having good enough games to crash  a message from someone who was too poor to afford a playstation
on december 10’s my b-day
Why does the PS4 look more modern than the PS5?
Suicide by rushed game development
Noooo
*PS5 has entered the chat*
Yeah, didn’t think it would work on there.
based
It’s so true ;-;
Bro why is this my ps4 when I play Sackboy...
Happy new year 🎈❣️🎉🎊
The name’s PS4. Base PS4.
It cyber pink
Despite the crashes, Cyberpunk 2077 is actually a Pretty Solid game!
It’s out and it has been took out as well
Looks like we're going to have to wait like 25 years for this anime to not be the saddest anime death of all time
Base ps4?
What’s cyberpunk
Looks like Base PS4 couldn't handle the Neutron style.
This is unironically really well-acted.
yea that is my birthday actually   im not lying
:(
My ps4 just left me after the ps5 got announced :(
Oh hey my birthday date
Raise a glass to freedom...
Me who still owns a PS2...

I'm glad this got recommended to me
Cyberpunk 2077 in a nutshell.
10 december is my birthday
Hey the same thing happened when i took the game out on the DS when it was still running
"Lets wait" very poor choice of words.
This is more intense and sad than Breaking Bad!
Playing PS6 pro games on a PS4
I thought that it was a ps2 until I saw the disc case
I was expecting craig from halo infinite to make a cameo
I don’t know why but every time I think of your name I keep thinking it’s pringles mcdingles
Man you need the KFC console
Ye our sweeties are getting crazy
This happened on my birthday? Why did no one tell me?

Is this a voice reveal?!
Thursday, December 31st
December 31, 2020
The background music sounds just like my ps4 when im playing red dead redemption
This is the perfect example of when the antagonist reaches the cool thing he's been finding before the protagonist but then messes up.
Why is the date and the video not the same
My birthday is on december 10th
I got goosebumps
At December 9, 2020 11:59 PM   Oh no...
Hello people in 2021 I'm from 2020
My birthday is on 10 December! I wanted to buy cyberpunk but......  The game sucks so I refund.
We don't have the game but we can tell that it's pretty much a big buggy mess since they spent little time on fixing any bugs
HE SOUNDS LIKE AN ANIME CHARACTER
Pringus, your voice is fucking amazing, holy shit It's super fucking sexy (not in a sexual way)
Wait that's my birthday
Its ok *hugs PS4* PS5 Is Ok....as Long they dont Make PS6........ Right?
Alas ps4s hardware was old 13 years ago
Nobody gonna acknowledge that the Dingus has spoken?
Why did the 5th console generation end with a game worse than fallout 76
December 31, 2020
You should have swapped the PS4 and the player
based ps4
What are you doing step PS4?
For those who don’t understand when cyberpunk first came out on the ps4 it’s was trashy the game always crashed it just didn’t work and it basically ended the ps4s career and made it die
This was a rollercoaster from start to finish
“Base Xbox One! Base Xbox oooneeeee???”
CALLED IT
i thought he had a bra on his head
Such a tragedy
Well it’s a good thing I changed my wishlist to Watchdogs Legion for Christmas!
Man... this hit different for some reason. Even though it’s basically what happens when you try to play the game
You sound a little like sonic
Vid * does error message for fun * Me:  welp time tó réset my ps4 Also me: sees the Vid ends on the Last second * Me: se you on the other side kid... * inserts cyber punk into mouth *
december 10th is my birthday
PS4: Suicide is badass
This made me attatched to an inanimate object that is in an animation
Bruh the voice acting is fire!!!
Lmfaooooooooooooo
Imagine making am Animation about Sonic trying to catch a ring
Not funny, but I still laughed
Damn, your content is so good and I have watched a lot of it and haven't subscribed until now. Keep it up! Also nice smexy voice 👌
At least Xbox one can run it
wow is it true if i play CP 77 on early ps4 can damaged the engine?
HO! HO! HO! I with a xbox only needed to deal with 15 frames a second and shittier games... at least we will have stalker.
Next you should make a movie trailer where one day Ps5 knocks on your door saying, "I heard you knew my dad." Then you reply with, "Who told you-" *ps3 appears* "I did."
fernanfloo
Basically the PS4 played itself
Cyberpunk Disc: Slides into PS4. PS4: Why do I hear boss music?

Console machine broke
STOP I GOT A PS4 FOR CHRISTMAS JSHDODBDSOD
Everyone knows it's bullshit that the game has a hard time working on PS4 and Xbox one, considering that it was made for the consoles
Ps4 looks like a object show charecter
You can hear it doing the Jet Engine thing... I like that.
I clicked on this for no reason but I am satisfied with my life discussion that led to this
Ehhh, games still shit. Even on Ps5 I have experienced multiple crashes
What about "December 31, 2020"?     I want an animation about the Flash Player plugin going to die
My Base PS4 handles the game okay, it hasn't crashed on me in awhile
I saw this and I got excited because I thought it was about my birthday :/
I got a Crash 4 ad and thought it was part of the video.
more like, based ps4
No more fun for you!
Yo Dec 10 was my birthday wtf dude
rip peepes4
I don’t get it
I haven’t been able to keep on gamer news what happens if you play cyber punk 2077?
Make this an anime and boom anime
When your ps4 starts to sound like a stuka siren while cyberpunk is being played.
I still have a base PS4 and it still works for me, but even I’m not dumb enough to try the cyber punk game on it.
Just so you know I was born on december 10🙂
OH NO
Base PS4 is Based
He was smart to say “Base PS4” cuz Cyberpunk slams on PS4 Pro
I’ve never seen pringus animate something this serious
OMG it's so funny 😂🤣
It really isn't that bad compared to fallout 4 on a computer of the same age.
Haha ps4 life span when coberpunck put in gonna go brrrrrrrrr
Truly a epic gamer moment
So thats how Johny nuked Arasaka tower
Can't wait to play cyberpunk 2077 its going to be so g-..........
Poor ps4 he was doing it for you
Based ps4   His posture fucking sucks not very based

That was highly accurate...
Ps4 suicide in a nutshell

Does anyone else’s PS4 fans sound like jet engines? Or is it just me
Cyberpunk 2077 crash you vídeo game?
December 10th is my birthday
Can't wait for cyberpunk 66 on the ps3
I wonder what would happen if you tried to run cyberpunk 2077 on a PS3? An explosion the size of state would probably occur.
This is cursed.       ...I love it.
you animated this so fast you legend
I, who have a Xbox One base model: "None of this happened"
“Works way better than expected”  Well how fucking low were your expectations CDPR????
Idk.. Cyberpunk 2077 work perfect on my PS4..
Not a rickroll https://youtu.be/4M81C6Os_Bw

It should’ve been the other way around but good job
same with xbox but ight
Personally I have a PS4 Pro so it won’t be a pro....... No No  NOOOOOO
Sorry for your loss😔
At first i thought this was gonna be involving PS5
Thanks YouTube for showing me this channel
This feels like a reference that I'm not getting.
What? I don't understand the big deal about Cyberpunk 2077
Planned obsolescence, amirite fellas?
Note to play cyber punk you must have a powerful PC or a PS5 with an 800TB data storage box.
Do another one where the ps4 realizes what it has done to himself
Why am I reminded of finding Solar in dark souls with that bug attached to his head
Oh ok
Yup😂😂😂
This anime almost rivals cory in the house
I dont get that joke... Cyberpunk f*cks up playstations?
Some say this is suspense music, but I know all too well that that sound was the fan 😂
What’s this anime called?
_“Welcome to Sony Airlines”_
Is . . . .is this cryaotic?
A masterpiece, as usual
So sad 😞
“Calm down”  Tell that to any overheating graphics card.
2020'd
Well fat ps4 CPU has 4 cores but slim and pro has 8 cores with better GPU, do not buy fat (base)ps4 at all
The ps4 looks like Robin sort fo from teen titans
Well...... My ps4 exploded too
Ahh yes December 10th, 2020. My birthday
i played kingdom of predators over this, even more sad
I cried. Legit. I wasn't keeping up with this game AT ALL. Even if it's a meme this was very good dood.
Me who still has a ps3
Top 10 anime cliffhangers
Got myself a base PS4 and after playing Cyberpunk 2077, only problems I had was the crash and HUD. My god, the, crashes...Rest was tolerable for me.
Okay, can someone please explain why the audio design is genuinely _this_ good?? Like---???
I love your voice!
You sound like Jesse Pinkman
Voice lines? Shit the anime really is getting more real with each passing video
Go commit Cyberpunk
Ironically relatable.
Why did I refuse to watch this
My brother has the game but it has alot of glitches so he does not like it

I knew Sony wanted to kill their fans PS4 so they would buy the new PS5 but i never thought theyd go this far.
That wasn’t suspenseful music in the background it was actually the PS4 starting up
My ps4 died on December 1st. I watched all of my shows through it since I don't have cable. Three years worth of game progress not to mention ALL of 2020. I still have not replaced it because the holidays have cleared out every store I have been to. And to top it all off, I am too scared to order one online because I have a long history of packages being stolen. This video hits way too close to home.
Maybe Cyberpunk 2077 was the friends i made along the way. Errors.
Lol my dad was playing it and it crashed on him too
Okay but like This animation is smoother than cyberpunk will ever run
Cyberpunk2077: Can't wait for all PS4 players to enjoy me  Call of Duty Modern Warfare/Warzone: First time?
We are discontented because we don’t know what to do with what is and being discontented with what is, we develop the idea of what should be. So our action then is based on an idea and the approximation to that idea is action and there is conflict between what is and should be.
OBJECT SHOWS ARE EPIC THIS BOI WATCHES OBJECT SHOWS WOAAAAAAAAHHHHH
Damn sad
*RUN BOIE*
March 31st 2020 Mario dies
Literally had to rip apart and re-arrange my base PS4s guts just the other day. It wasn't simply because of overheat via videogame tho...it's because I live in Australia and summer will melt your electronics just as well as it melts humans.
what just... huh..??
So This is why the Xbox is better 😂! But dang it actually couldn’t handle the power of cypherpunk 😂 Rest In Peace 😭! Happy holidays and here’s to 2021🥂
That wasn’t the sound of rising tension, it was the sound of your PS4 overheating
Meanwhile I got it and it was pretty okay
As owner of a PS4 pro. Things are not much better. Example being War Thunder. They recently updated and is not optimized for that Machine. An inter cooler will have to be purchased.
For YouTube   Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin  This World is so Sad I just want anyone reading this know that their LOVED so much by  ...  God he gave his only begotten son for you he loves your smile,your Hair,your sweet gestures,your eyes,your the main thing he wants His Arms are always open waiting for you to come home but most keep running away   It’s tearing him apart inside knowing he LOVES us all so much but most don’t love him  some even hate and blame him for all the wickedness in the world even though Humans have Free Will they kill,hate,destroy  REPENT and Accept The Truth today
Can anyone Tell why cybergpunk can play in ps5 but not ps4
Is it me or do the eyes look like hair
It took years for cyberbunk to come out and it sucks
*Me with my dog when I left the groceries alone
The “ACHUUUM!!” Never dies but it isn’t here?!
Yeetus, Yeetus, commit self deletus!

This is too graphic.
So its not supported?
Why does this like a intense sence on a action movie
I'm now glad I got ps5 games on my ps4 not cyberpunk 2077

John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Obey God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!
Yooooo thank God I didn't stick the disc in yet or else this would've happened. The PS5 version Still crashes alot though and is buggy af at times.
Wat
The voice acting is top tier
This is a mood
Our boy HES TRENDING
Base PS4 sounds like those evil dark ego empowered bastards on Jak and Daxter.
I got a hard copy for Christmas so i know what I'm going to play.
“Base PieceofShit4?”
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏🙏💐😀💝💝💝
Based on true events
Lol wawawiiwa
Rest In Peace ps4 you tryed and you died -   Good video man.
Hey random person scrolling down the comments .     Have a wonderful day  :)

One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates♦️Non-Duality
LOL
thas a spicy meme
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. All you have to do is believe and turn away from sins if you believe this and want to share the gospel which is the good news pls share this or google any Bible verse of the gospel and post it on so others could see and be saved God really really really loves us.❤️✝️ idc if you like just pls share. Build a relationship with him to get to know him, read your Bible.
Can i borrow your cyberpunk?

0:53 my dryer beeped at this exact moment. Made an excellent cap to the rising BGM

It is the 29th...
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Ps4?
december 10 2020, the day my PS5 arrived....

Sounds about right
I was honestly waiting for giornos theme to play at the end

THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have  you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said  was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief,  blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will  end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we  broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so  loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever  believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16).  Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses.  He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today,  repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift  of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the  Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit  NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com
"Wait why are there two discs?"
The 2077 in the name does not refer to any year, but rather the temperature of the PS4 in celsius and how many megatons of TNT the ensuing explosion's force will be.

Omg *plays* later throws PS4 down the toilet   Hey where is your PS4 me: what PS4?
The reason ps4 can’t have cyberpunk 2077 is because he will have an error.
Thought this was because of scott pilgrim being delayed again. Lol
Solaire when he finds the Sunlight Maggot
Despite how funny this is, it's pretty accurate..  Damned game bricked me, and my Bro's PS4 Pro. Dunno how a singular game does that, but yep..

Cyberpunk works on PS2 fun fact
Ha, jokes on my base PS4. My wallet is empty.
I've seen several times where the game is barely holding on and makes the crashing noise but keeps working
Why do I feel like this was a SpongeBob reference?
Tbh Cyberpunk was actually pretty lazy compared to things like GTA or watchdogs. Plus it had 7-8 years of development time which makes for a real beeg oof.
Bruh, this just made me wonder if cyberpunk was in development for years, even before we ever heard of the ps5 and the new Xbox how was it not able to run on that hardware (ps4). They must have been the testing the game on a console or something so how was it not running properly on the old hardware?
Xbox better ngl
Idk why but the start of this I got heavy “ive been waiting for you patrick* vibes. But maybe thats because I always think of that scene when I see someone bent over away from the “camera”
we need episode 2
Hey that’s my birthday
Very off topic, but did anyone tell you that you could probably mimic Sonics voice?

“THEY THINK THEY CAN REPLACE ME I DONT THINK SO” -spongebob
Hearing your character with a voice is awesome but kinda weird ngl
This was amazing XD
This is representative of Heroin addiction. You start out by getting addicted to LEGO games. They’re harmless you think but they’re addictive. But then you start playing Uncharted. It’s got the same adventure and exploration as a LEGO game but it just really high resolution. But then you want more open world. So you start playing Horizon and God of War. You get addicted to this open world stuff but you want more freedom with a sand box game. So you play Red Dead 2 and you find out the same dealer also makes GTA which is more modernized. And then you try Saints Row because it gives you the same high. This stuff is cheap and makes you feel really good. You have so much freedom that you get to do anything you want. But then you want more and more. You want something new. Something... futuristic. Then you hear Cyberpunk is coming out in April but it’s delayed multiple times to December. You’re sick from withdrawal and you just want to inject as much of this Cyberpunk into you as fast as you can. But it’s too much.

Pringus's real voice sounds like Sonic but older with a hint of Knuckles and Shadow     Wasnt expecting his voice 2 be that deep
Interesting way to put eyes on a PS4
Looks like someone's base PS4 got... Cyberpunked

Cyberpunk was procrastinated to the point where they decided they should make it a bomb.

Oh...that's unfortunate...  Love the dramatic tension tho
The ps4 fans really added to the immersion
I love how the crescendo in the background reminds me of the Joker music from The Dark Knight. Great touch!

PS5: well about my brother
I don’t understand why would they release the game if it’s so glitchy
I had to watch this on my birthday     What a great gift
... so this was recommended 5h ago? ...
Strange, mine's worked fine so far. Silly glitches but overall good
I thought this would be about the update that bricked a couple older PS4 consoles.

I somehow knew exactly where this was going, and had no idea where this was going simultaneously.
Alas, poor PS4

Sorry for your loss.
Holy jesus I just got an update prompt right when the ps4 error message popped up
Funny thing, my PS4 did the same thing over a downloaded game I haven't played in almost a year. The game went from pretty, to bugged, to frequently freezes/crashes, then corrupted, then my PS4 database was corrupted, barely managed to squeeze out half my game data onto an old flash drive, struggled to turn it back on for a week, initialized and watched 2 years of captures go away along with the other half of the game data (thank god they weren't any I genuinely cared about), and then the software itself went bad after fixing itself for 30 minutes. Turns out my HDD went bad and the only ones online that fit my slim were WAY too damn expensive. That was late November. I'm still without a fix.
PS4 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! D:

I don't know what to say, it works okay on my PS4, and I'm fairly certain its an old model as well. Either my platform is magic, or I got really lucky and downloaded a more stable version of the game.

It's funny how a game developed for a system for 8 years runs like shit on the systems it was developed for.  Wait, not funny, sad. And aggravating.

I mean, TLOU2 melted my base PS4 so I never got to experience Cyberpunk
Love the Joker music you chose.
"PS4 + Cyberpunk 2077 = ..." be like :  Me : *Cyberpunk 2077 = E.T. Atari 2600 ?*
What a paradox
nice! :D
PS4 = 💀F L A T L I N E D
Funny how he actually was waiting his whole life, considering when the PS4 was released and Cyberpunk 2077 was announced.
Imagine all the people who watched LasagnaCat thinking that they uploaded again

Uhhh wat he fricken dies from the game.. huh
Man, I'm so glad that Crash 4 runs well on PS4, because apparently new games running well on consoles isn't something I can take for granted anymore...  But seriously, Crash 4 is a good game.
I'm glad that I find this inside my recommended

Title: December 10 2020. The video: 1 minute and 20 seconds long. Me: WHAT
Just like Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated. Except the whole console shuts down when it tries to run it.
That’s your real voice? I envy you. I wish I could sound half as cool as you.

Love how people kept pressuring and basically bullying the developers to release cyberpunk Then it has bugs and glitches and fault them for releasing it too early.
Nice the game only crashed 10 times over the course of a week
You have a really nice voice

I’m not getting Cyberpunk....EVER  I just got my PS4 and we’ve already gone through two all nighters!!!  WE’VE BUILT OUR UNBREAKABLE BOND ALREADY, I REFUSE TO PUT IT THROUGH THIS
Go back to sleep Samurai, the city isn't done rendering yet.
I feel like this is based on some anime, tv show, or video game, but I can’t remember
This is impossibly cute
Yes
dont take this the wrong way but you sound so much like Joel from vinesauce its uncanny
The day my mom got me cyberpunk 2077 I knew she want my console dead
Flashgits and now this, whats next?
It's December 28th, stupid
ngl i feel like this could be a side quest in the game
It went all according to the plan to make you buy a PS5.
Thus the true purpose of the PS5. Infiltrate the corrupted data banks of its older brother and reclaim its apostate soul from its wretched corpse. Something to that effect. Lol!
If only the PS4 knew....
*halo suicide voice line*
The title is my birthday. I see now that on my 21st birthday, the apocalypse hit...
Base PS4 where are you
ps4 anime when?
I legitimately thought he was saying “based PS4” and that this was gonna be a PS5 meme.
one moment of silence for everyone who watched this on his ps4 and thought their ps4 actually crashed
Best damn anime Suicide episode
Poor ps4. I was scared when he had cyber punk in his hands.
wait...  those limbs...  *they look fimiliar*
Rip PS4
Then it got taken away from us
Damn dude, this minute long video had a more compelling plot that cyberpunk.
Next victim: PS 5
I said, "Oh no," just a second before Pringus 😆
The fact that he has no pupils makes it more sinister

Bro your voice acting is so good
Is cyberpunk 2077 worth the money?
That's some anime shit right there
Why did this feel like Greed and Ling in FMAB
I felt emotional from the performance of the PS4
The power you coveted, corrupted you, destroyed you
I waited 8 years for Cyberpunk until August I'd been playing on PS4 (which by the way crappiest thing I've ever bought crashes more then a computer) but somehow in my gut I knew it was going to be shitty on PS4 so I switched to my roots and traded it in for a One. Yes it looks terrible and plays terrible on both but I waited 8 years for this game so I'm not going to give up on it now. And in my opinion it's actually a beautiful well put together game it's just sad that CDPR was rushed by a bunch of impatient tryhards and when they finally caved and wanted to make their player base happy by releasing it early even mentioning months prior to release that it wasn't ready...guess what? The tryhards that begged for the game to be released now shit on it go figure. 🙄🤦‍♀️  Anyways love you CDPR ❤️
F in the chat, lads. We lost another one.
Heyy
Ps4 committed suicide
Encontraste el comentario en español, tendras suerte el dia de hoy

My base PS4 just had to hear the game to cease function
And this is why I play on Xbox.
ok
I wanted to try it on Xbox so I put it in an- *KABOOM*
The escalating noise you hear is the PS4 overheating
*Cyberpunk main OST plays*
Oh no his going to dye because of cyberpunk
We need PS5 to calm him down
Haha, he called u a kid
Since I'm the dumb idiot I am, I have no idea how buggy Cyberpunk 2077 is. If the game is this buggy... *why did it get released?*
Ah, my 18th birthday. What a wonderful day.
Bro, I thought you would have a soft, nerdy voice. Nothing wrong with that but dang.
I was thinking it was cheese.
Ps4: FINALLY I HAVE THE POWER!!!  Me: Noooo  *Ps4 corrupted as a result like every other power hungry person*

Get it because it’s like suicide for the ps4
He saw you eying up those ps5 specs. He just wanted to go out on his terms
I feel your pain I really do
"Have you seen the look on that JPEG!"
If the ps4 was a pokemon. Cyberpunk would be it's last resort weapon
I'll be honest. I thought this was gonna be about Sephiroth because I forgot Cyberpunk 2077 came out on Dec 10th.
From that day forward, you've been mourning over a construction block
Preem
At 0:16 I thought it was cheese
“December 10” **Checks Calendar** Huh?
All he wanted was to vibe with Keanu.
PS4 kills itself and other stories
"Don't stop me Pringus, this is my life purpose. If I can't put this game to work, I can't put any game to work"
Pringus has a nice voice tho
The players: oh god this game must come out now it's already done dew it Also the players: this game is shit way worse than assassin creed unity they should have delayed it again
LMAO THIS IS SO ACCURATE
Fun fact, the PS4 literally waited for it its whole life, the game has been in development for over 7 years
What a tragic story...
I have a base ps4 and it had a very unhappy time trying to run spiderman miles morales
PS4 Pro handles it better.  I still get crashes though.
“A funny comment”
🅱️
Fellow PlayStation Stands....Lets have a moment of silence for a fallen brother....
And on that day, millions of PS4s were snuffed out by the demon known as Cyberpunk 2077.

lmaoo i like how you guys say base ps4 as is the ps4 pro is still fine. it isn't. get fucked.

Idk why people complain about cyber punk on ps4 looks good works fine and has no bugs( other then the ones me and a group hunted for)
Car go vroom vroom 🏎
Rip all of the based PS4s that tried to play this game
I mean it is 7 year old hardware, that wasn't even the best when it came out.
It's a good thing I spared my ps4 because I wasnt on the cyberpunk hype train
"And after that day...the only thing left behind by his PS4...was the one remaining HDM1 cord, half burned to cinders....his son of a PS4 Remote, and his dear friend TV, PC, and other's....how will they recover from this?....lets wait and see"
I think Pringle just has a split personality and decided to animate it
yes
Yeah. You should have just made PS4 insert it in its head like a gun and blow up.  Nice writing there with the "IM DONE WAITING" line.
I love your videos UWU!!!! YAYY!!!!
& I still don’t have a ps5 or Cyberpunk
My PS4 has an Orange skin and it's been so long that I forgot that the PS4 was black
%100 of the Base PS4's cause of death.
The saddest thing is that the PS4 really waited her whole life for 2077. And we got this
We have a ps4 to burn
😂
Whole console suicide
Yeah, thats true ngl
It is sad what happened when Cyberpunk 2077 was released, I only discovered how broken it was a few days ago when I watched videogamedunkey's review on it. It was more broken than Sonic 06!
That was just sad and in loving memory of PS4

They... released it on... the PS4?  Why?  When SMB3 came out, Nintendo didn't try to put it on the NES. Why? Because, it's not a good idea.

Surprisingly my day one ps4 can run cyberpunk
Wow, that is what I did not expect a game with bugged physics to do
He was so buggy that everyone died
This is so sad
It looked like he was holding an onion ring than a disc
I turned 18 on that day. One hell of a birthday present I must say. Too bad I can’t play it because I have epilepsy.

There is desperation, and there is extreme desperation, and sometimes, extreme desperation leads to loss. Let that be a lesson.
imagine a cyberpunk port for switch
PS4 did not want to die this way...     ... He was only following orders.
I'm playing PS4.....

Haha Yup!
Literally thought the fan was gonna fuckin fly it's way out of the PS4 when I was watching my friend play it

If the PS4 looked him in the eyes and shoved the disk up his drive, that wud have been epic

I can relate to a spiritual level
Who hurt you?

Im sorry Pringus we did all we could do to save him... You'll only find him in heaven now.      He won't be waiting for you.
It's like when based ps4 put pineapple on pizza
I’m trying to remember where the dialogue is from
I got cyberpunk ps4 for Christmas and we’re currently driving to target to refund it
You missed the opportunity to make the blue line his mouth
Buggy game with no snacks
Don't worry, to console you I decided to make this sweet console pun
Weird, I didn't know this channel uploaded real footage.
NOT BASED PS4!

I think that’s enough of the Internet for today
Ever since he played cyberpunk, he turned into a ps1.
I can't wait for the switch version of the game.

I have nothing better to coment sooo...                        *K F C    C O N S O L E*

Almost at the end of the year and you make video like this that's better than most stuff I've seen all year amazing

The joker music is what got me.
Welp. Guess you gotta get a new console.
if your ps4 is experiencing suicidal thoughts make sure to call 420-691-POGU
Just play demon souls lmao
PS4, wait!  "I'VE DONE MY WAITING! EIGHT YEARS OF IT! IN GAMESTOP!"
"I've been waiting for this game, my whole life.." I mean it's not *technically* wrong
Flash will be gone :(

Goddamn your voice is cool
A little but of tuning, you could voice a really good V if you ever make an animation for CBPNK2077
Xd this is a good animation and ps4.  Ps4 Voice is kinda scary😂👌
Keanu Reeves can only too so much CDPR....
Don't worry, just get a KFConsole and you'll be all set.
What if PS4 was an anime
Happy 200K.
Had dealt with the similar shit glitches and screen freeze. So glad for full refund.
Best Quote: "I'm done waiting!"
Same as my old Base PS4 after 2 years of Fallout 4
*i'm sorry for you, pringus.*
man, Xbox one gives me the same vibes here.
As someone who owns a base ps4, I can confirm said events
Accurate. I never bought Cyberpunk 2077, so I'm just going off rumors. There's a video where someone cooks chicken on their PC while playing the game...
Pringus is a damn good voice actor
Cyberpunk is literally capable of turning any console into a nuclear warhead.
Base PS4: Alexa play Rebel Path
Just imagine watching this on YT on your ps4
cyberpunk claims another soul
Really sounds like Greed from FMA Brotherhood
Your animations are always a treat
its dec 28 tho
Imagine though, if the PS4 turned themself into a table and chair set.
Pog
Base PS4 then broke the 4 dimensions and the universe collapsed. Time and Space has been corrupted due to an ęřŕøř. Płəą§ę ţřý æğâïņ.
Rip ps4
Cyberpunk has controlled all of society by this point
Hoi
Ps4 really just took the equivalent of a cyanide pill
The problem was that ps4 wasnt a pro.   This joke is associated with R.I.P ps4 in general gang
It be like that sometimes
Me just logging on YouTube what I was missing on recommended first I click and I said enterraining luv it
I halfway expected PS4 to evolve into PS5... Then again, this is extremely accurate. Well done!
Actual voice acting in a Pringus video? This has to be a miracle
Can PS4 Pro Handle It?
Did you forget to name it?
10/10, the animation is pretty *lit*
When I saw the thumbnail I thought the PS4 was crying because he has been outclassed by the PS5.
Literally the timeline you stop him is a recreation of exactly how close I came to making this same mistake.
don’t talk about it
My dude copped an illegal copy of Cyberpunk. 😔
Damn, that consol can ececececce
Do more animations based on sailor moon
Great storytelling, top tier voice acting, animation is brilliant, visual effects are on point. In summary: Very amazing. Total rating: 11/10, i like.
Probably should’ve gave it the Data disc first, huh..?

Everyone: I’ve been waiting for this game Base PS4: No I’ve been waiting!
Yes probably
The true ending
Oh come on! I just got the game for Christmas 😑
This happend to me but with a xbox one and fallout 76
The PS4 just wants to play a game that isnt garbage
*not that* *anything but that* *PLEASE NO*
technically he has been waiting his whole life since the ps4 came out in 2013 and cyberpunk teaser came out 2011
This Is So sad guys im shaking i can't believe base PS4 would do this
*looks at my ps4* you good buddy? Ps4: *holding the extra memory drive* yeah! Lets play!! *epic high five*

PS4 sounds like Vic Mignogna. X)
wen the PS4 wants to commit suicide
The quality of content on this channel never ceases to amaze me.

Good news cyberpunk 2077 has rele-    Bad news...cyberpunk2077 has released...

Why did that last quote from ps4 remind me of greed from fmab?
Pringus! Are you ok! The PS4 committed suicide! We sadly have to move on....
I think you're a bit late
