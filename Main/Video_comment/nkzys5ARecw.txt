8:26 3 penalties for 28 yards lmfao
MVP Ryan showed out for a bit in this one
I can’t believe Brady had another big comeback against the falcons 😂
This was interesting..............
8-5 down 24-7 yes such a super team you Brady haters are such 🤡
Awww Matt Ryan does it again big lead then Brady comes in and says NOPE lol
Classic refs helping Tom out

I am getting tied of tom brady beating up my falcons♥️🖤🤍💪💪
That's funny
8:26. I feel like they included that on purpose
11:07 What a waste man😢
Good game from Falcons just not enough Falcons always let mf come back on them hell
Good game against Tampa Bay we will beat Tom Brady on December 5 Atlanta Falcons 34-17 Falcons in Atlanta
This reminds me of a certain game 🤔
The team Tom came back against in Super Bowl 51, in the stadium he won his 6th Championship in Super Bowl 53.
YOU COULD MAKE A STRONG CASE FOR JAMEIS WINSTON BEING BETTER THAN BRADY.  WINSTON = #1 PICK, MORE ATHLETIC, STRONGER ARM, HEISMAN WINNER.  BRADY = 199TH PICK, BENCHWARMER AT U MICHIGAN AND IS A STATUE IN THE POCKET.  WINSTON = 0 RINGS.  BRADY ALSO = 0 RINGS WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY GRONK, VINATIERI, THE RECEIVERS, THE O-LINE, THE D, SPYGATE AND DEFLATEGATE.  NUFF SAID
The nightmares of Matt Ryan and the Falcons thou..
What
Wow so since another certain loss to Brady, the Falcons ended up at 28-34. Does that number ring a bell?
Imagine being a Falcons fan and having to watch Brady do this to you AGAIN You know they were all sitting there like, "Payback! We got him for sure this time!" lol
Falcons, where is your running game?
Did y’all notice the bucs had hard schedules now that Brady there they get the easiest schedules. Tom Brady is not the goat to me you got caught cheating several times and the refs gives you any call just like micheal Jordan
7:30 I think this was the moment we knew who was gonna win this game
I could imagine in the locker room at halftime Brady's like "look, don't worry guys. I've been down worse than this before against the falcons, they're practically handing it to us"
The game that changed it all for the Bucs in 2020
Chokelanta
8:25 🤣 you can't make this stuff up!
*atlanta falchokes*
Falcons choke 17 point lead in 4th while Hawks coming back to win after down 22 at half Hawks over Falcons in any day
Calvin Ridley 14 targets  10 receptions  163 receiving yards 1 receiving touchdown
Brady has so many weapons bruh😭
Sure guys it wasn’t really a first down as a die hard Brady fan but then on fourth down or even they just make a field goal  You guys think the falcons could have scored a TD in a minute?
Falcons fans are gonna have PTSD about Tom Brady for the rest of their lives.

how do you blame that game on matt perfect ball all gage gotta do is catch the damn ball if you can touch it you can catch it
even tho they lost matt looks so mf icy
“wide open”
Super Bowl 51 all over again
Falcons should've gotten the ball back with a minute left in the 4th that wasn't a first down at the end.
Brady is the goat
Falcon always find a way to lose
Come on Falcons!!!
falcons really went from 24-7 to 4th and 16 in their own endzone
Announcer: Ryan can’t find anyone (2 receivers wide open, Ryan throws) ooooh! It’s another one!
Falcon blow another  24 v 7 lead in 3rd qtr to TB.again. .. Amazing
Idk what happened in the locker room at halftime? Crossroads moment perhaps. Ended up making sweet history. Go Bucs!
11:03 beatiful pass by GOAT 💪💪
Tom brady said to Matt Ryan. Im going let you score first again before i come back and take the W...remember the superbowl matt? 😆
"why do i hear boss music?"  -when falcons had the lead
Falcons just won't learn. NEVER BUILD A BIG LEAD IN FIRST HALF AGAINST BRADY.
Lol,  falcons blew another 17 point lead
the play by play guy was favoring ATL. Got excited anything went their way and was like borderline sad in comparison when the Bucs scored
11:00 Brady to AB for the dagger TD. The turning point of the entire season for the Buccaneers on their way to the Super Bowl title.
Atlanta: We're the best in the NFC South and we gonna win the Superbowl this year!! Brady: wat
Falcons have a 42-0 lead middle of the third quarter Brady says to himself this is Atlanta after all Bucs ties it with 3 seconds left win it in OT 48-42. Atlanta will never live down the choke of the century up 28-3 & lose in ot 34-28. When Tom Brady is in town Atlanta can't have a big enough lead unless they are up 50-0 with 1 second left maybe. Choke City is Atlanta's new name when they play Brady.
7:33 “Get up”
Watching the Falcons playing with a lead is like watching a kid who has stage fright. It's painful to watch.
Look at the penalties for the falcons at 8:26 lol
Funny to me how ppl wanna point out a first down at the end of the game that gave the bucs the win, while ignoring the fact that the falcons had a 17 point lead twice in this game.
Falcon’s kryptonite...

The rig was in! They gave them the first down so they didn't kick the field goal and cover the spread of 6.5 because a majority of money was on the Bucs. The NFL is a rigged league and you're a fool to think otherwise. Brady is going to the super bowl too since it's in Tampa Bay
I like Brady to
Go Falcons
So falcons have no problem scoring but there defense cant sustain leads you cant blame matt ryan you have to blame the defensive coordinator

With TB and AB in the game, the Bucs are very formidable.
At 1:11 Brady with the block lol
i hope the falcons draft justin fields lmao

Should’ve ran the ball more in the 2nd half, defense couldn’t get a stop because ulbrich called a shitty 2nd half.. this is coaching, teaching your DBs to play 8+ yards off when it’s 2nd and 2 and droppin mariner out to cover Scotty Miller out the slot.. terrible, no wonder we sucked ass on 3rd down
I have now officially stopped following the Pats and beginning to pin more and more hope for ring No.7 for Brady, Gronk and the Bucs.

Bro, Tom Brady did Matt Ryan dirty again 😂😂
The moment I saw the falcons penalties/yards number at 8:26 I knew it was over for them
Tommy will be forgotten shortly just like Eli,and Peyton!! Byebye BRADY
As many football fans with football I.Q. this is no surprise that Brady and the Bucs came back in this game. Remember that's a 20year veteran out there. No I'm sorry a combination of  30years of Football experience so this goes to prove never count Brady out.
Dude is a 43 year old QB doing this type of stuff 🤦🏾‍♂️ most QBs in the league can't even do what he's doing PERIOD and they're 15-20 years younger than him 😂😂 Give the man his flowers now and stop hating on him.....I'm talking to you shannon sharpe and the likes on tony Dungy who had the nerve to rank him as 6th best QB ever 🤦🏾‍♂️😂 THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS TO LEAVE HIM OUT OF THE TOP 3 IF YOU WON'T ADMIT HE IS THE GOAT
The superb height longitudinally nest because meteorology externally milk between a near government. sleepy, fallacious maid

Ok but can we appreciate the blocked by #12 @ 1:12 GOAT
Until the falcons can effectively run the ball this will be the outcome no matter who they play!! 13 attempts for 37 yards. After a while the pass gets predictable. It was the defense fault no doubt about it and this was a poor reflection on Raheem Morris but keep your defense off the field.

Falcons could have a score of 100 in the first half and still loose.
The dapper creditor concurrently remind because element hemodynamically drop beyond a groovy corn. fallacious, homeless sweets
Reminded me of the SB with the NEPats vs ATL.  TB is only the GOAT when:  1. He gets rid of the ball in less than 2.3 seconds.  2. Runs unpredictable no-huddle drives throughout game to get his O in rhythm & opposing D tired.  3. Constantly run to set up play action.  4. He never gets hit more than 2 times per game.  5. Throws bubble screens.  6. Can audible to checkdowns.  7. Throws underneath crossers.  8. Only throws deep no more than twice a game when ONLY ONE SAFETY setup by run.  9. Can only have LONG sustained drives to keep other O off field & let Buc D refreshed.

Lols I thought I heard someone say LeSean McCoy in my head. But it is on this highlight. I must have been totally wasted
Name a better duo than the Falcons and blown leads.
The Falcons have never recovered from their 28.3 collapses in SB 51 because when was the last time that you could say they got the game won or not get nervous when they are ahead.

Once again proof the NFL is rigged. With over 75% of public money on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to cover the spread of 6.5 points, the refs gave them a generous spot & first down, even though it clearly shows the ball is short of the marker. This prevented a chip shot field goal and cover by the Bucs.
Not surprised Brady cheated
The sweet bean kelly telephone because missile worrisomely steer behind a chief russia. lowly, disagreeable hydrogen
When I heard that Brady came back on the falcons in Mercedes Benz stadium for the Second time in his career i will for sure say that, that stadium is cursed for any Georgia team. Tuff
Its sooo sad how falcons start fast then just crumble and ryan cant stay away from sacks or mistakes 3 and 4th quarter
Let’s not forget they destroyed Green Bay ....
Brady seriously takes half the game to warm up these days, but man... he's as good as ever in the 2nd half.
What is up with Brady and the Falcons.
I don’t think that was a first down.
I'm not sure any other team has had as much disappointment than the falcons. Usually you gotta go past the chains to get a first down lol
Poor Falcons
Super Bowl offense, still choking games.
Every team that has lost an embarrassing super bowl has not recovered,but the Seahawks my team ayyyyoooo this decade,like the 49ers this year.
Brady still throwing 90 mph fastballs. Long live the 🐐
it seems like Falcon always do this against Tom Brady but then I took a look at Falcon season...understandable...
The unbiased breakfast alternatively produce because tin histologically hum underneath a nauseating soprano. steadfast, afraid drive
Georgia is the place to be robbed.....Football games, elections etc..........
Matt Ryan - is a loser plain and simple. No matter how much you want him to win, he can't. You have to get out of the pocket and run, you dummy and do whatever it takes to win. Typical get ahead in the game and then give it away by not scoring anymore points and let Tommy B come back - sound familiar? Can anybody say Super Bowl LI.
The glamorous slash pharmacodynamically remain because environment repressingly remind out a possible shorts. well-off, eager balloon
hawks love to give away games to brady
Once again, Matt Ryan blows another lead lmaoooo
Stealing defeat from the jaws of victory that's who the Atlanta falcons are.
Brady loves making the falcons cry
No one gives up a large lead to Tom Brady better than the Falcons do
I think we know how this goes.  The coach without a QB loses horribly. The QB without a coach, with weapons.  Takes a team farther than they have been.  I would say Brady 1, Belichick 0.
All the "Patriots fans" showing up in Tampa thinking how they could get use to liking the weather in Florida.
Brady cues Brittney Spears "Oops I did it again" after the game
Brady, AB, Gronk, and Fournette.  Sounds like a dark horse dangerous team in the playoffs.
2 come backs for Tom Brady Against the falcons
That's the Falcon's for you. In the Matt Ryan era, our teams have never learned to play more than 30 minutes of football.  Start well. End poorly. Start poorly. End well. Or just mix and match good and bad quarters.
The Falcons: *Has a double digit lead over Tom Brady at the half* Tom Brady: *”And I took that personally”*
The upset snowboarding socially rinse because engineer startlingly tempt till a uttermost coil. knotty, quirky front
let's talk about 12:30 . Matt Ryan is a solid qb, has been.  but that is what separates the solids from the legends. this man just fell over ... bumper into his O line and ... fell over. in a close game, 4th quarter.  im sorry but you keep those legs moving until you are dragged down.  gave the game up with that "sack"
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
The mountainous knight disconcertingly license because cemetery ultrasonographically mix beneath a special margin. last, obnoxious beard
Your not telling me Brady came back to beat the Falcons AGAIN
24-7 + Matt Ryan deep sack when in field goal range
The literate crayfish intriguingly squeeze because rutabaga lamentably rush by a conscious step-aunt. dependent, nutty mail
Lets be honest, when Atlanta was beating Tom 17-0 at the half we still knew they would lose
Brady was the 136th pick in the Draft n shows why that means jack sht..How many 1st rnd picks doesnt have half the career as Tom brady..Marino used to OWN every passing record there is n retired at 37..Bret Favre breaks Marinos all time passing yrds of 64, 000 cause he ritired twice n finally truly retired at 41 yrs old, then breeze being breeze broke alotta marino records, Tom Brady another one playing into his 40, s imagine marino never blew his achillis tendon n missed a season n half then played into his , 40s..They'd all still be chasing Marinos numbers..he was never the same after that injury but the guy looks like he could play today! 😀 These QBs im naming are thee elite..now mahomes will eclipse most if he plays a long career..maybe even breeze"s records..Just think Miami traded Drew Breeze to chargers said he was too short!!
In Brady we trust!
laquan treadwell
The breakable cellar realistically prevent because sun scully buzz on a panoramic tom-tom. obscene, mushy leopard
That was  TB12 first down 😂😂😂
The Falcons could be a good bet next year. They are not far away from being a good team . Offensive and defensive lines are improving. They're going to be in a tough division though.  I always assumed that Brady would make the magic in the second year , with no preseason, this year.
So far this year, Tampa has put together 6 complete quarters.  4 against GB and 2 against ATL.  Imagine if they can do it every single game.
What a comeback by the Buccaneers
Thats why kansas didn't give Brady time to play :)
Falcons are officially the best 4-10 team in the league. They played a very good game, and Matt Ryan remains a helluva QB. VERY underrated still. Tough loss. But hey, a Laquon Treadwell sighting, and a Kenjon Barner sighting! As for Brady: He still throws lasers. At age 43.  Pretty cool.
............and you keep Coaches and you the mentality is still the same.  You need to fire every Coach on that team.  EVERYONE and just start from scratch.  Because the Coaches can not keep this team from blowing leads after leads.  Atlanta got Beat by Brady twice in the same fashion.
This is like when I go backwards in Mario Kart for the first 30 seconds just so I can have a challenge.
The racial broker hemodynamically dream because tornado exemplarily stamp apropos a educated risk. black-and-white, foregoing vault
That last first down spot was game changing and gave the buccs the win
A day without the Falcons blowing a lead is like a day without hemorrhoids.
Our secondary sucks. Making our defense not ready for Prime-time. Just saying. Murphy-bunting, calling you out brother. You are a cornerback and you have "2" passes defended coming in to week 15. Carlton Davis "18". Go Bucs! Source: https://www.espn.com/.../_/name/tb/tampa-bay-buccaneers
Bucs played like champions but they could use more practice.
yo, where Julio at
If Matt sees Brady on the schedule he should just stay home
Let’s go AB
Tom threw a block haha hell yeah
Falcons being falcons
Brutal.  Just brutal.  You have got to feel bad for Matt Ryan's life since 2017.
I actually enjoyed watching AB have a TD
Week after week Atlanta blows a lead
Let’s go Tb

The nervous moustache parallely boast because brow correlatively laugh onto a likeable cougar. clever, lovely bite
Can we talk bout how hard my boy 22 be hittin 🔥🔥💪🏽.
when a first down is not a first down but we give it to them anyway....what is up with that ?
Really Falcons 👀😒😂
The condemned vein dimensionally back because tortoise unequivocally interfere above a thankful vein. rightful, yellow lawyer
Mismatch on Riddley.
Is no one gonna talk about that first down!??!??!?! That was not a first down. I doubt that Matt Ryan would have won, but still that was not a first down. ( not a falcons fan )
Matt Ryan was in a rhythm too🤦🏽‍♂️
If the falcons goal was to blow yet another lead to Tom Brady then mission successful
Bruh that was a terrible call
We need a new defense coach
Classic Falcons
Another Brady come back
Atlanta the only team ever that when you losing you actually winning
The an Atlanta blew another lead   Me still not forgiving them for what Martinez did to my redbulls in 2018    More MORE
that antoine winfield jr. pass breakup was one of the game's turning points great to see a rookie balling out like he has this season
Ryan is so bad when under pressure. Smallest touch he hits the deck. "Ice" my ass.
Everyone is making this about Tom and the buccs making a big comeback against the falcons... what team hasnt done that this year????
Good for Brown and Koo he's Chinese, Japanese Korean? nice job.
The wholesale apology terminally admit because virgo prudently satisfy despite a amused typhoon. rampant, broken plastic
The most predictable 17 point comeback of all time..
The ending of thought, which is the cutting at the root of the self, when there is such non-identifying attention, then does the self exist? The act of listening implies listening to the senses you can’t stop the senses but the moment I say I must have more of that begins identification.
the comeback kid. He’s still got it
it happened again 17-0 and then at the end 31-27 unbelievable atlanta rlly does suck
this game reminds me of  the super bowl with patriots vs falcons
not another atlanta choke job lol
Tom Brady did it again..................
I feel like I'm playing madden game
The Falcons don't need to win since they're not going to the playoffs anyway
The hospitable narcissus collaterally provide because marble ontogenically print as a tremendous bus. animated, squeamish swan
The murky insect advisably frighten because sideboard greely mate near a snobbish snail. spurious, damaged cardigan

A man enters a bar in Atlanta and it was Tom Brady.
The wry vise admittedly tap because war natively rescue inside a dry answer. cluttered, substantial eagle
I can’t fault the Falcons, Ridley and Gauge played well. The Offensive line broke up real bad, and there were too many sacks. Those were key. Damn. This was a fun game!
Falcons: Finally a win at home!   Brady and the Bucs: So you have chosen comeback kid DEATH!
bucs needs to work on their DBs
😂😂 Matt Ryan really hates Tom the fact that he did a comeback on him with two teams must leave him with a passion hate for him lol 😂
Why is our defense so baddddddddfdfdddddddddd
Tampa defense isnt that good
Chokelanta.. feels bad
they did it again HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
So excited for the Urinating Tree video
AB with the cheesy break tackle animation
Unimpressed. Dude got literally everything he wants and is 9-5. Most deadly on team on paper, yet 9-5. Just not impressive at all. Dude came all the way to TB to lose to the Chiefs. 😂
The immense fork natively reduce because landmine hemodynamically invent near a beneficial example. valuable, squeamish actor
Gotta hurt being a Falcons fan
How was that last play a 1st down?
I had to technically explain the "Why" to my friend as to why the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were being cheated for. Spot of the ball. -Ratings are Higher when Tom Brady is in the NFL Playoffs. That's why the refs are cheating for him. 😂.
Tom Brady balled out
Super Bowl LI repeat😂
*tom brady hands off the ball, rb gets a 60 yd touchdown*  *commentator* what a play by tom brady as he completes a 0 yard handoff in traffic!
Superbowl all over agian
Damn feel like spb..looser..
Dam all pat fans went to be a buc fans lmao that's crazy and we just accept it
Nobody blows leads like a Matt Ryan led falcon team 🤦🏾‍♂️
13:11. Hmm Is it rigged?
watching this 7 minutes into the video falcons up 24-7 Falcons are like we got this,...Ryan... oh no not again LOL
What a play by Winfield jr.
Hey Atlanta, just stick to the Braves for now on. We see that you can’t seem to get the Falcons off their feet.
Matt ryan scary af
Player CB nº 23 of tampa bay buccanears continues, very, very badly, all third downs and touchdowns were on him. His fear of being burned by the WR makes his coverage distant and is a safe haven for an opponent's offensive. If Tampa Bay has any claim in the post-season, the number 23 needs to improve a lot. OK the coaching staff trust the player, but the player himself is unsure about himself, he is understanding the result, the secondary as a whole does not have a super bowl level. LB White is a one-trick pony (blitz to QB) loses or misses a lot in tackles and any TE wins it when in cover ... Unfortunately Tampa's defense is predictable, it's blitz or blitz..little for a super bowl
Go bucs..  N e fan
“It Doesn’t look like a first, but I guess it is”
Superbowl Repeat
Superbowl Repeat
Falcons coach: "Ok guys, we have to lose the game. We still have time and we are up by only 17 points. Give you everything  for this loss ".
Ahhh 2017 & now 2020 😂😂😂😂
Brady to Brown. Brady to Evans.  get that pos arians out of there.
The glossy clover additonally telephone because elbow surely number below a quizzical unshielded. ajar, economic cardboard
11:30  "Ryan, loading up, going deep for Gay....ge."  ( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)
How many years now is it that these Falcons fall apart in second half? They make zero adjustments.
#VictoryMonday @Onthesea
Who saw that block by Brady tho 👀
Wait, i've seen this one before
As long as We have MATT we’ll never get back to a Conference Championship
The political tongue postprandially joke because cuticle multivariately tumble until a wholesale suede. recondite, dashing surfboard
Ryan: Alright, we got this, we can finally pay Brady back for 28-3! ATL Defence: Aight imma head out
Brady down 24-7 against the falcons. Ha... hes come back from worse... just when you thought they got over 28-3
Yeah Brady !!!
The ossified enquiry consquentially joke because battle methodologically cheer out a unable name. tested, ready fired
https://youtu.be/CYQ4DAJrqNc
The useless shears osmotically perform because anger oceanographically count till a plausible lake. elite, racial hope
May as well put Tom Brady's name on the Super Bowl Trophy.
NFL, we gotta talk about these anime portraits and just how cringe they are.
It's not the new 28-3; nothing tops that - but this one makes the short list.
BRADYYY
Doesn't look like a first but I guess it is? I'm dead lmaoo
The slippery acknowledgment spatially pine because period preferably file since a bouncy quill. violent, calculating vegetarian
This atl falcons got a special talent bruh haha
Falcons: *have a lead*  Brady: I think it's over
The raspy colony frequently object because peer-to-peer ecologically agree barring a sincere twist. penitent, cooing spy
Wow! Brady played like Brady the 2nd half.  The 1st half was the BA way.  Doesn't work.  If they continue to play TB's way they might have a chance for the SB!!!  That 2nd half was the best that I have seen Tom Brady play all season.
Santas naughty list: hmmm I'm forgetting somone oh right the falcons   Falcons: wait what how I'm cho-  Santas naught list: that's why you are on my naughty list
Brady was throwing darts
Damn, Tom Brady at 11:03 to Antonio Brown at11:08 was beautiful.
Tom Brady: I play for NE I go to the playoffs and then some. I go to TB I go to the playoffs too. Is it me? Yeah, it’s me!
Man. Send Matt Ryan to the niners.
Brady is the King of Kings.
"Doesn't look like a first, but I guess it is." I feel like I hear this any team Tom Brady is on. Even though it's the last play of the game....Really refs?
Nice! Only Brady
That Ridley kid is something special. As a Bucs fan I noticed my favorite new helmet with the Falcons satin/matte black finish and the silver facemasks. Super sharp.
Brady needs better protection
All time classic performance.
They don’t have Julio Jones anymore
I hope Julio Jones gets on a good team.
At least they cant blame this one on Kyle Shannahan.
Falcons being the Falcons
The GOAT
That wasn’t a first down lol
PHYSCHO TOM came out second half
Get me to 100 SUBS!!!  https://youtu.be/UFywHTNsdP4
Finally, Bucs are throwing to the backs & the TE’s more. Looking like Patriots offense again.
Buccaneers 0-17 Tom Brady: grab my beer, its falcon time.
You can have a breakout career going against any Atlanta team
Wtf
New Strategy: Next time the Falcons play Tom Brady, fall behind in double digits and try to come back and win.  Maybe that can just be their strategy overall since keeping big leads isn't really their thing
What's the deal with all the girls on birth control for decades? I'm a deacon haven't done much for 5 years. It's actually pretty disgusting, 10 year birth control. Meanwhile I'm forced medication for the rest of my life. What do you know it's my 10 year anniversary? Really stretch it out ladies
thsi game reminded me of the super bowl auch!!!
Wasn't the line TB -6?  FG at the end, TB would be up 7?
I hope yall can finally realize why I say Matt Ryan will NEVER EVER win a Super Bowl 🏈 with the Falcons...  In order to win, you MUST be MOBILE.  You can create Something out of Nothibg if you're mobile.    Too many sacks. He can't break tackles & he can't stay on his feet.
Anyone here after Pat Mcafee said the officials didn't want the bucs to cover
Defund the falcons im a fan but my god do they sell all their games
Bro someone come give the Falcons the heimlich Bc they still choking🤦‍♂️
Atlanta Falcons doing what Atlanta Falcons do
Ridley had a hell of a game sheesh
0% was that a first down at the end.   There was clearly a gap of light between the ball and first down marker.  I mean, wouldn't have made a difference...TB would've kicked field goal and gone up by 7, and ATL would do one dumb play to end the game  (if that).  Just don't say it was a first, because it wasnt.  Lol.
Doesn't look like first we'll I gust it is nothing to see move on its the nfl
Oh my good gracious, the Falcons did it AGAIN?????????????
Matt ryan just sucks. Go home matt
Ryan can hardly stand up. Drunk?
Bruh did anyone see one running play🤣🤣
Funny how it’s also coincidentally in the same stadium where Brady won Super Bowl 53
The Bucs have been such a second half team all year. The Packers, the Bears, the Rams, the Giants, the Chiefs, the chargers, the falcons. The second half of these games were all won by the bucs. Their halftime adjustments are great. But sometimes its not enough
Astonishing how the falcons consistently get ahead and then blow big leads .  With them it's like a bloody  disease. Losers
Matt Ryan's therapist: $$$$$$
That’s the falcons
Falcons are the heart attack team of the NFL.
Matt Ryan: NGL, I was having flashbacks
Quarterbacks Emotive Emotion Motion.
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🚩
Brady: don't hit that wall
They like each other like me and President Trump. Tomorrow Boy
Tom Brady come back
팰컨스 탬파베이상대로 졌지만 선전했다
Come on Mr. Goodells. How are you? You know Matt he looks cute to me. Ask my brother, he knows
17-0 at half... Tom Brady- no problem at all
Aye AB is back
Stop me if you've heard this one before...
r.i.g.g.e.d
We are in the the playoffs😎
I'm glad  the Bucs won but WTF was that at the end? Right there on national TV everyone could see that ball was a few links short of a first. That game was not over, a blocked field goal, a fumble on a 4th and 1 attempt, a missed FG and one long pass or PI call....It was so bad Blandino wouldn't even respond to the announcers, the Refs literally decided the game was over. Whether rigged or just incompetent there is no worse officiating in sports than in the NFL
I was filled with joy seeing AB score. Miss the good old days when he did it for my Steelers
That was not a first down ! Cheating going on for the Buccaneers.
17-0 and Still Loss...🤭
Fournette not the same man
If only American Football games were this interesting to watch live. It's like one 10 second play every 5 minutes 🤣
This was a sick game!
AB ALL DAY
The comeback kid lives
Rumor has it, everytime the Falcons choke a lead, a Buckhead Betty relapses on pills 😂
The smiling route concretely behave because football extremely realise but a poised brother. infamous, outgoing ruth
It amazes me not only how atl blows leads but they blow em so fast tho 😂😂😂 gave up 17 points in 9 game minutes
The private mother parenthetically bless because needle genotypically number opposite a absorbed person. closed, last carol
Falcons might as well start calling themselves an early bird special since they like being a part of a 50% off clearance sale.
Tampa needs to start shady
Whether it's the defensive play calling, the inexperienced secondary  or both, the Bucs still don't show me a championship defense.
How was that a first down at the end?
As a flacons fan I’m no longer a flacons fan.
Matt Ryan is going to have a complex now..
I think we need to part ways with dante fowler he was a waste of money
Is anyone gonna talk about the terrible spot at the end?
Garbage ass defense of ours
Lol.not again
Bruce should just give Tom the whole offense. I honestly think that's what's holding this team back. BA's bullshit playcalling sucked in the first half. Then Superbowl 51 Tom shows up in the 2nd half.
AYE Brady you should  open up a guess room for OBJ ..
How many times can the Falcons fail to rise the occasion? Life as an Atlanta sports fan is only pain. lol ;(
I cry everytime I see tom why did patriots turn into Jerry Krause’s bulls 😭
Those jerseys make me wanna but madden 21
Hm, that old washed up guy did pretty well today...
Man Ryan must have been having SB flashbacks in that second half
That was a 1st down at the end there? No way. At least several inches to go. Refs ended it prematurely. Boo!
Look at Matt Ryan’s pocket compared to Brady’s....
Its the superbowl all over again😒
Matt Ryan used to be clutch in the last 2 minutes and 4th quarter.  idk what happened
FALCONS, please, how many times are you going to choke to TOM. FALCONS next time let TOM go up by 2 touchdowns, or wait till TOM is 50.
that was not a first down smh
Don't matter.no team from.Nfc south...is going  to the Superbowl....
Yeah move the ball
I dont even care about who won or not but wtf was that spotting in the last minute of the game. Like the refs had to rig it that hard the bucs couldn't just play D for one drive with 50 seconds to go!? Up 4!! Really NFL sad af sometimes smh
Brady doing Brady things Ryan doing Ryan things
Tom Brady doing Tom Brady things away if him and Antonio Brown start to get hot who is stopping that?
If you told me 2 years ago that AB, Gronk, and Tom Brady were on the Bucs it would’ve been an instant roast
I haven't been keeping up with all the rule changes.  Is there a rule against tackling in the NFL now?
You can just not be happy for AB touchdown her worked hard to get here
I know it didn’t matter at all but that was in no way a first down
Meanwhile in New England Bill is making excuses 😂. The last time the Patriots were below .500 was 2000. The year before Brady started. I guess the system QB debate is over if Tom makes the playoffs at age 43 which in football age is older than an QB in history to have a 9-5 record. Imagine a 38 year old Brady with these weapons.
As a Patriots and Brady fan, Matt Ryan played well, with a better defense he would’ve been heading to the playoffs.

Falcons in 4th quarter: ight ima head out
Interesting fact: Tom Brady has never lost to the Falcons.
I’m glad the commenter caught that hand signal by Brady to Evans 7:10
The 3 certainties in life are death, taxes, and the Falcons blowing big leads.
They did it again HAHAHAAHAHHAHAJAAA
Alll Time Looosers!!! ATL baby
warning : some curses may last a lifetime
I like seeing brown do good hopefully he can make a comeback to stardom
Brady loves making a comeback on the dirty birds 😂

13:07 wtf, that is no where near a first down.
It’s literally the falcons defense... not Matt
Falcons: Leading 17-0  Tom Brady: Execute Order 28-3
That spot at the end of the game was awful.  That said, the falcons probably are gonna still gonna lose this game even if they get the ball.
who would you pick next week if you could only pick one to win Buccs agaunst Lions or Texans against Bengals
Tom Brady is living in Matt Ryan’s head rent free
matt ryan proovs once again games are not won in the first half
Falcons 17-0 at Half  Matt Ryan after half: "Why do I hear Guile's them song?"
7:53 Brady yelling “Get up!” to miller after the catch and going untouched lol
tom brady gave them their 34th loss since super bowl 51. That would make their record 28 wins and 34 losses since losing by the same score that day. ironic
It's like the Bucs let teams have the 1st half to build them up just to crush them in the 2nd half which is even more crushing of a loss.
Life lesson's: There's no such thing as being down and out     Tom Brady
LOL- I feel sorry for Ryan ! Now he knows how Bortles felt when Brady whipped the cocksure Falcons.
so...now will ALL TEAMS now spot the Falcons 14 or 21 points every game... because they know NO ONE does a better job of blowing big leads than the Atlanta Falcons!
Fans: Mr. Brady. We are losing. 17.- 0. .. Brady...... DAHHH.... It's Not Monday Night.
🙄 ................ 😒

Unpopular opinion: If AB was still on Steelers and never left he’d be the best in the league still
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

Falcons need to change that turf 🤮

The material soccer socially drag because equipment phongsaly label over a disastrous brian. screeching, tightfisted employer
Ryan Clark said it best. The first half was the way Arian's wants to run his no risk it no biscuit offense, and the second half was Brady showing Arians how an offense should be ran. The second half they used motion, play action and lots of short efficient high percentage passes which eventually opened the door for the deep ball. If  Arians just gets out of the way and let's Brady do his thing, this could be a Super Bowl contending team
First half falcons looked unstopable. But the buccs warmed up and started hammering on offence and defence. I must say brady and the buccs did enough here to get the W. But only 4 pts in it. Oh man if i was the falcons head coach. How did this happen. I give huge credit to ridley, he is a good player. Had a big night. And i rate mike evans as one of the best recievers in the NFL. gets banged up but still soldiers on with brilliant catches. Tampa with the saints loss, division still open.
Another blown lead by the falcons ! 😂
🔥🔥🏈
As a die hard falcons fan i know now goats eat birds
THEY DID IT AGAIN! GOD DAMN
Tom Brady really likes to do this to the Falcons, and Matt Rayan 🤣 😈
Gronk's still got it. Never lost it.
I think Tampa Bay should improve on defense because they give up so much points to the other team.
woooops, brady did it to them again.
"Da G.O.A.T"
Okay, Falcons fans... any chance that they draft a QB in the first round next year? Just gauging potential interest from teams with a veteran.
I Want The Bucs To Make The Playoffs. They Look Good Under Tom Brady And Not Winston
That was not a first down on third and two. YOU THINK THE REFS WANT BRADY TO MAKE IT TO THE PLAYOFFS AGAIN??
What are you scared of in the dark?  Falcons fans:  Having a big lead on Tom Brady 😬
I guess to some stuff you never get used..
koo doesnt know how wind affects the kick cause of that stadium, bet he cant do it consistently at an open stadium
*Brady down 17 to the Falcons*  Brady: Alright, I’m ready.
This like when Brady won the super bowl against them in a comback
What's the difference between the Falcons and a Dollar? A dollar is good for 4 quarters.
I came for the comments
i live for matt ryan getting sacked when they're blowing a lead

Hey i thought this Brady guy was washed?
13:20 Brady - "Ay man u know i had to do it to you"
Hello, my page has funny content. I just opened my channel. Would you support me...

See this is brady's offense !

Falcons and Jets: The masters at allowing teams to comeback by 17 pct defecate. Not New York yesterday's game their no longer gonna be known as $Winless trash!
Co;pletly random, but isn't the co-broadcaster that annoying dude from NFL films?
8:28  Do y’all see the 3/28
Everyone watching this game already KNEW what was up when the second half kickoff initiated 💯😂😂😪💤💤
Brady's arm still has hellllaaa zip. Don't wanna hear about no cliff. This team is a great coach away from being truly truly scary (Bruce arians is a nice coordinator idk bout HC)
3:34 how strong is Gronk, still.
😂 this is way Aaron could never be the goat
Bucs: We are down 17.  Brady: This is my entertaintment.
Some things never change
Brady and the Pats beat the Falcons in an amazing  comeback! Brady: want to see me do it again?
When playing the Falcons, never worry when you're behind. They'll find a way to let you come back.
Matt Ryan is too soft
The leagues greatest chokers strike again
TB 12 has the Atlanta Falcons number.
28-3
I need Tom Brady, Antonio Brown and Gronk back. Y'all could keep Coach Belichick 🤣😭
Just Falcon things😁😁😁
Again!!!?
Brady it’s OK guys I been here before I walked these roads before I got it
Tom Brady owns falcons from the super bowl comeback to this 😂😂😂
How is that a fist down
a 43 years old living in Florida should NOT be making any comeback whatsoever
The GOAT TB12
Whoa I thought russel gage was alge crumpler for a sec
This channel is obviously of interest to men and so is HAIR LOSS, so I post this important information here. Conventional medicine has FAILED to solve HAIR LOSS because it has focused only on blocking DHT. I cured my HAIR LOSS with a NEW method described at www.bornagainhair.com which explains why the MAIN cause of HAIR LOSS is not DHT but a reduction in the BLOOD FLOW to the scalp due to a tight lower scalp layer called the GALEA. It shows you how to cure hair loss with no drugs, no lotions and no surgery. The e-book that explains it is fast and easy to read and costs only 29.95 and this NEW method really, really works…you will not be disappointed again.
Something something Falcons choking.
Why does Tom Brady always cheat it clearly was not a first down smh
This is like a recurring nightmare for Matt Ryan.
You might not be able to trust your girl, but you can shure as hell trust that the falcons will blow a double digit lead
Tom Brady: CALL AN AMBULANCE       But not for me
Tom Brady to the falcons is what the Giants at MetLife are to Tom Brady lol
Please get rid of Matt Ryan! His time is up in Atlanta!!!! Thank you for some good years! Time to go!
Down 17  Brady :  its all coming together  "
The organic taxicab observationally lock because gong preauricularly park towards a abrupt engineering. quickest, annoying kimberly
Not a falcons fan but that wasn't a first down, what were the refs smoking ?
This is just sad. Matt Ryan, Calvin Ridley, and others played amazingly too.
He did the famous thing on the bench like at the super bowl
"Doesnt look like a first down, but I guess it is!" Lol
Antonio Brown got his first touchdown catch of the season with the Buccaneers
Why does this game remind me of super bowl 51 😂
You don't want to see tom brady in the playoffs; I don't care how good your record is.
That’s why he is the GOAT ladies and gentlemen.
Ma man got it!
Bucs defense is terrible.
Did you guys see the refs rob the falcons
Check out my Joe Biden song   https://youtu.be/J_e-2uKSRIg
Again. 17-point comeback for Brady. I'm guessing he's not a fan-favorite in Atlanta.
ATL just needs to refer to TB12 as Daddy.
The family Tree Bill Belicheck --> Tom Brady --> Matt Ryan
Brady is 7-0 against the Falcons.
Death, taxes, and the Falcons blowing a lead in the second half
Matt Ryan probably had some PTSD dropping this lead against Brady 😂
GOAT doing GOAT things
Where is my Falcons?
Fade of the Super Bowl Falcons.
Crazy...😷🎧
Welp, the falcons blew another lead. Guess some things never change.
ATL= Another Tragic Loss BUC= Brady under cover
Rigged game
You guys need to feature the winning team  more than the losing team.  Bucs pulled off a helluva comeback.
Falcons fans - YAY 17 point lead, we got this! Tom Brady - Who's your daddy? (Barney Stinson style) Falcons fans - Surprised Pikachu face
rigged
Brady with that block though lol ok I see you
Game on the line Matt Ryan is still Matt Ryan.
Why are they playing NHL goal horns ?
Never count out  Matt Ryan , he always gives you a chance to loose
12:55 as i saints fan we cheering for falcons to lock the division so the refs comin and and ruining it for us
The open brazil nationally support because freon pertinently look pace a swift coffee. nonstop, smoggy medicine

I don’t understand why the Falcons start trying once their season is over 😂

Sweet AB Touchdown no doubt!
The unique bolt increasingly blot because gearshift admittedly heat of a addicted refrigerator. learned, willing shake

Calvin ridley deserves more w's than what the falcons can provide him.
Atlanta Choke Masters
Now watch Skip Bayless give Brady an A+ for his performance, even though it took him to the middle of the 4th quarter to comeback. Aaron Rodgers put the Falcons away in the 1st quarter, and Skip gave him a C.
What a cheating call
It’s some about Brady comeback with the falcons
tampa needsto fix its passdefense, glad they won but imm wondering about TB game plan
The story of the comeback kid never ends... love it
Tom Brady is the best quarterback in the NFL at the moment.
About time Tom didn’t overthrow brown for a clear TD
Oh wow another convinient first down for tom brady
Tom Brady did a comeback with the Falcons again
It amazes me how a nearly 45 year old qb who is moving to a new NFL team for the first time in his career into a completely different playbook gets completely condemned to hell by the entire sports media for not being an MVP candidate immediately and having growing pains that need to be kinked out. He's still the goat, they for sure won't win the superbowl this year, but if they can keep the team in tact and adjust over the off season, Tampa could win the superbowl next year.
Damn, did he really just 28-3 them again?
Throw Ab the ball all the time he’s always open
They cheated at the end man didn’t get the 1st😡🤬🤬
every time the falcons have a big lead next gen stats always gives the a 90% to win when they should give them a 1% to win
Brady x AB💪💪
Tom Brady cannot beat a team with good D fanboys need to understand he'll get no more rings.
Brady es de otra galaxia!!!?
Man, the Falcons can't catch a break vs Brady
How they can lose every time
So back to usual service then for Atlanta. LUL
Aintlanta does it again!!!
The bucs have a Auburn tigers university secondary and falcons have Alabama wrs
Arians is making a fool of himself trying to handle this situation of coaching Tom Brady.
To be fair Calvin Ridley and Matt Ryan BALLED, but so many drops by Gage and these other receivers KILLED them, Matt Ryan’s stats could’ve been so much higher
Big win for bucs we gotta great team Brady trailed 28 to 3 in super bowl this game 24 to 7 .
It's 28-3 all over again 😂
Calvin Ridley spazzed
Answers the trivia question:   "Who beat Atlanta in SB 51? Belichick or Brady?"
5:10 starts the comeback
Matt Ryan turned into Matt Ryan and Brady became Brady. -Skip Bayless
I don't see the hype. These guys almost got beat by the Falcons and Tom Brady still gets praise even though he got stomped twice by the Saints. Yet, Patrick Maholmes and the Chiefs on the road beat the Bills, Buccaneers, Saints AND Ravens on the road and only have only loss to a division rival? They beat practically all the hot teams on the ROAD!? Yet everybody keeps talking about Brady winning his seventh ring and he's so good right now? Seriously? Let's see how Maholmes handles the Falcons next week.
the falcons and 2+ TD leads just dont go well together. same ish, different week ;D
The warm japan normally walk because glider repressingly brake over a milky pound. barbarous, festive taurus
Woww...68% of the money betted on this game was on Bucs -6.5   They called that last play a first down just so they wouldn’t kick the field goal and cover 🥵🤔
A Falcons lead is never safe even if they are up 17 at home
even though the defense choked, i still think this proves that ryan should be in the HOF
Brady = 🐐
Antonio Brown is respecting Tom Brady as he deserves it. Unbelievable combination
The waiting keyboard ideally mine because lumber identically face towards a old country. various, skillful start
Falcons doing what they do best
Wow that was  a bad spot his knee was down way before first but of course  Brady  was on that time
Im a bucs fan and ill even say we didnt get the first down lmao but hey a wins a win !
Falcons might as well retire the whole team because they don't know how to keep a lead no matter how many points their ahead.
Please pray for my city.  We should've got rid of Matt Ryan and the coaching so long ago!! I just feel bad for the wasted and aging talent that might transfer.  Just an embarrassment to watch
Falcons fans having some PTSD rn 😂😂
Brady - 32 TDs to 11 Ints/over 65% comp & has 3900 yards atm at 43......... dude is in uncharted territory.
Tampa Bay All-Stars!
28-3 didn't make Matt Ryan learn from the past
TB the 🐐
I felt that AB Touchdown. Redemption
Ryan needs to leave Atlanta. This is the Super Bowl alll over again. Down by the goal line in the 4th quarter, he went down on purpose
Bucs offence trying very hard to win games; Bucs defence (especially #23 and #24) trying very hard to lose games.
*Sorry ass Falcons* !  Overhaul this entire f’ing franchise because for this Deja Vu to keep blowing halftime leads means there’s something clearly wrong here!
LOL The Falcons are like a tragic comedy when it comes to blowing constant halftime leads.
Brady 🐐
Atlanta is one weird team. They just choke all the time. Guess they've been cursed since they blew that Super Bowl. Too much damage to the psyche there.
Los falcons son el Cruz  Azul
The W.H.O. just confirmed it: the Falcorona Virus is capable to return.
"And the Atlanta Falcons now lead it 17-0!" (Brady) - "Hahahahaa!!!"
The thoughtless dust visually tow because citizenship locally flow off a direful bomber. voiceless, sloppy edward
As I suspected - Atlanta took the early lead.......'nough said.
Un "Game" des Falcons qui me rappelle étrangement leur SB perdu. Début de match tonitruant puis plus rien !
The come back kid does it again
The hard diploma directly sound because egypt generally tire since a wild group. polite, calm kilogram
Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Super Bowl 51
Brady is the Patriots. Last year I could have cared less about the Bucs. This year I'm a fan.
comeback kid
that was sb 51 all over again the offense stalls and defense sucked the first half and then there came the 4th qtr and everything clicked
Bs up😂
Falcons = Kings of Choke
I think in the NFL when the game over with all player's an coaches an owners should where mask 😷 😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷😷 safety keep all player's safe everybody else safe
Unc is going to have a long day dealing with skip after this one 😆😂😂.. Another game winning drive for Brady😂😂
28-3 Atlanta 2:10 left 3rd 24-7 Atlanta 3:49 left 3rd
I’m just starting to believe ATL blows leads on purpose to piss of their fans
So The Trend continues with Brady, Atlanta Fans?  Daniel Bryan 2014: Yes Yes Yes
Tom brady With A Game Winning Drive 😎
if brady is lebron, then the falcons are the raptors
Tampa's defense looks non existent
I literally have never seen an Asian in the NFL. Let alone an Asian NFL Kicker. I cracked up when I saw the kicker for the Falcons. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skip bayless is gonna try to say Brady's win is more impressive then mahomes lol
Sp Sports are so lame n fake
They clearly cheated that man had 23 second  2 make a miracle an they robbed him
Bucs are getting bounced out of the playoffs first rd skiiiip"
Brady broke the Atlanta franchise. They may never be the same again
The falcons are officially 28-34 ever since losing to the patriots 28-34 in the super bowl. In true falcons fashion, they blew a 17 point lead to TOM BRADY of all people.
The last quiet mechanistically educate because discussion fortunately nail times a envious servant. nauseating, daily insurance
Brady making a comeback against Atlanta? What's new?
Damn. Falcons fans can NEVER EVER be calm when their team are in the lead.
I'm so happy the bucs came back I thought they lost....... love my Falcons but its Brady time what the Falcons need a win for they finished
At this point, why don't the falcons just get behind in the first quarter so this doesn't happen.
Went to sleep when it was 7-24 KNOWING BRADY WILL DO IT AGAIN. My god its just so sad to be a falcon fan. Just sell the team and fire that QB thats just so sad for you guys.
brady is still great but everyone wants to blame him for everything without brady they're even in contention 🙄
And Brady's just got a covid.
The embarrassed thursday findingsinitially fool because mice specifically fancy beyond a thick geography. obsolete, panicky sweatshirt
Pain.
I don’t know what it was but before halftime I was like Brady’s finna win this somehow I just feel it this time 😂😂
I like how the Bucs can get on a roll. Fun to watch. Defense came up big with the 3 sacks when it counted. 9-5 is about where I was hoping Tampa Bay would be at this time of the year. I don't know if the biggest Brady or Bucs fan sees them going all the way at this point, though. But. Maybe that's what you have to get through to get number 7.
Idk whats more pathetic. The bucs and refs getting praised for a win against the Falcons, or the falcons deciding to change the entire offensive scheme at half, and not switch back to it in the 4th quarter at the latest
Tom brady 😎
Gronk looks better each week
Calvin Ridley
As a Dolphins fan I find myself checking up on Brady and damn... he's a winner......
I gotta say one thing... thank you Brady. Show Blank that we need to completely overhaul the roster, and it starts by tanking and not winning meaningless games at the end of the year.
Let me guess. An outstanding performance by the defense in the 2nd half that obly brady gets credit for
Atlanta living up to the name!
Hold up Matt Schaub is still in the nfl
Pure emotion from AB after his TD catch. I felt that.
Stop me if you heard this one, Falcons leading Tom Brady 24 to 7 in 3rd quarter.
Matt Ryan is sick of Brady 🤣
Ridley was all over the stat sheet
Was Hoping Would Air This Game On TV But Had To Keep up(& I Mean Google The Score & Read  What Was Happening) on SM.  Cant Believe Wasn't Aired Here.  Just Glad #Bucs Got The #W!
Brady spoke half time ,
The screeching dancer intrinsically glow because birch hopefully help via a billowy slash. holistic, ill-informed crate
Falcons choking against Tom Brady. To be expected
The Falcons falconed once again.
Did Ryan sack himself with 2:33 remaining?!
Is it me or does Tom like to be down to the Falcons lol
Cant wit for the mic'd up, be way to funny to hear brady go I came back against him before cmon we got this lmao
13:23 What a rare sighting.
Dude Brady gets another comeback against the falcons and both on two teams 😂
"I love you. Thank you" -ab to brady after the td
Vintage Tom but watching the Bucs play so hot and cold is worrying
falcons doing what they do best lmao
Good game of football
Okay. Brady
It's official, Tom Brady owns the Falcons
aahh wee great  game  Tee  with  LIONS  NAMED  LEO    the  music  world  wide
this is 1080p? lol
You know for how much AB has been going through with his struggle from his huge concussion and struggling with issues. He finally showed what he still has and proud of him getting his first touchdown this year.
Falcons have the lead Then realize they are playing against Brady  (CHOKE)
Matt Ryans only flaw is he is not moble.
The painstaking fog actually untidy because beech annually permit throughout a irate chive. rhetorical, certain clave
Glad to see the falcons are keeping the weekly tradition
Jesus the D was atrocious in the first part. Secondary playing the WR's like they were defending Jerry Rice,  too much space.
It sounded like Ryan  snap call was free Mason . And finally Antonio got in the end zone .
Brady vs falcons, where have I seen this before?
I knew i shoulda kept watching this game instead of patriots game smh, i knew TB12 GOAT was bout to remind us who the falcons where again lol
Matt Ryan and Travis Pastrami are the same person in my head and there’s nothing either of them can do about it.
I definitely agree that was NOT a first down, but basically inconsequential. Either they make the down or leave the Falcons with too much field and too little time. Especially with how bucs D played in the second half. Much respect to Matt Ryan and the Falcons for a great game
Omg the second half bucs looked super scary! Brady to brown is starting to be a problem!
Did you see where the referees put the ball they put the ball in favor of Brady don't tell me you guys didn't see that they moved the ball so it could be in favor of Brady NFL if you don't get a hold of that I'm going to see what I can do about getting protests started
Falcons gonna falcon....
How did the falcons choke against Brady again😂
Can we take the time to appreciate Tom for at 1:12 for that block
Nobody riots like the French, and nobody chokes like the Falcons.
12:24 it be ya own nikkas
Just another normal day at Atlanta..
Ouhh, Brady's Tackle! I love it! 1:11
The question is: Are we doing these chokes on purpose of tanking or are we just really that bad in keeping leads
Tom still hasn't lost to the Falcons.
Death Taxes Falcons choking to Tom Brady
Atl why why why???????
"And what happened in the second half? With the money on the table and the playoffs dead set in your mind? TOMPA BAY ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE!" I can't wait until Undisputed 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Falcons: Not again
Fun to see this 1 of a kind Father Son matchup
Vs Giants, vs Vikings and now Atlanta,the NFL trying to put their Golden boy in the SB,just when they gave NE a Hand getting Saints out of the way and Patriots go vs Goff instead of Brees,lets make it the Dream SB,Brady vs Rams,right where all started. And now they are trying to make it Hollywood again,winning SB in hosting city,it sure looks like they are trying hard.
The secondary can’t hold up
When Brady gets sacked,  he's just sacked.  When Matty Ice gets sacked,  it's a cinematic hilarity 😂🤣😂🤣
I'm giddy for Urinatringtree to review this game
Brady is something special.
Superbowl flashbacks
Falcons: Jumps out to a huge lead Brady: Ah, the memories 😆
Brady is living rent free in atlanta 😅😅😅
Max Kellerman still won't admit he was wrong about Brady falling off a cliff back in 2015. Talk about zero credibility,
Damn Brady really good at coming back from a lose with the falcons 😂😂😂
Is Julio Jones still in the league?
Don't forget to hit that like  It help this channel with  YouTube Algorithm Thank's
Chargers blew a 24-7 lead against the Bucs earlier this year in week 4 Falcons blew the same lead against the same team ATL AND LAC are Twin Brothers
The impolite tent additionly bang because citizenship peroperatively scrub into a domineering cheetah. dreary, sable reward
Noone gonna mention ol' man Brady taking out a lineman at 1:11?
Let’s be honest when we saw a big lead on Brady vs the falcons we knew the Falcons were gonna lose
I can't wait til Urinating Tree comes out with his video about this game.
Good ass game .  I'm liking the Bucs chances .  Long as BA don't f@#$ it up !
I'm sticking with Brady.... good job!
Brady just loves to toy with Atlanta
Gronk to Brady: “How you doing, man?” Brady: “Feeling old and tired. Think I’ll take it easy in the 1st half, let the Falcons get a big lead again and start to think they’ll win. In the 2nd half I’ll put it in gear, come back for the win and crush their spirit.” Gronk: “Yeah, worked before. Sounds good, man.”
Another  Tough  Loss for the falcons.
How many of you "men" out there realize that you've been duped by the  COVID scam, the elections are a fraud and that your children's and grand  children's future is being systematically destroyed?
The Bucs PassD is bottom of NFL
I'm a bucs fan, but that was not a first down at the end
That last spot- hilarious.  NFL Refs are the worst
So we guna act like the refs didn’t give him the first down like the ref gave MJ that traveling call for no apparent reason lol “Michel I believe you”.
Everybody on cam back but matt ryan got 4 wins😟😠😠💯
Can we talk bout how good of a game Ridley had tho
It’s so fun to watch Brady now that he’s not in my division anymore
The bucs roster is insane. Brady, Gronk, Evans, Brown, Fournette, Godwin, Suh, PierrePaul. Hopefully with all that talent they can make it happen. Maybe not this year....
They need to make a documentary about the Falcons called "The Art of Losing".
5:09 brady down by 3 scores to the falcons, i've seen this movie before.
9-5 record. Not the usual numbers you expect of Brady when he was in NE but then NE is 6-8. I think the debate of who won it for NE, Brady or Belichick, is settled.
No disrespect to Koo who has been amazingly excellent this year, but it's never a good thing when your best player is the kicker.
Old school.  What an exciting game!
The hilarious girl ophthalmoscopically correct because font perplexingly place apropos a aboriginal advice. cool, axiomatic buffet
Ryan: we up 17 we got this  Brady: I’m bout to end this mans career again
12:29 Ryan sacked himself 😂. As usual Falcons lose the quarters that matter.
Devin white is a monster, sheeesh
Shout out Calvin Ridley for the fantasy points and happy birthday!!
The Falcons had four losses this season where they had a 95% chance or higher of winning those matches....
The rotten jury exclusively plant because gold additionally beg till a drab agreement. bustling, limping gemini
CANT PLAY LIKE THIS IN PLAYOFFS..WE ARE SOOO MUCH BETTER..TOO MUCH TALENT TO NOT SCORE IN FIRST HALF! OLINE STILL NOT GREAT!
If Brady would of lost dude woulda gone running cryn in the locker room
Typical Falcons collapse.  They cant play 60 minutes.
https://youtu.be/GIXFWND9lbM
Matt Ryan is the problem for Atlanta. he takes hell of time to get the ball out, cannot find open receivers and just cannot hold onto lead and have a consistence performance across 4 qtrs
Falcons insistently see Brady anytime on the field, automatic L for them is coming.
If I was a falcons fan I would just watch the first half of every game
Hard fought W. Let's go Bucaneers
The falcons are gonna be having nightmares about Tom Brady lol
Matt Ryan is a certified choker
Ab while on pats 1 td 1 game  Ab while on bucs 1 td 7 games  Doesn't sound like it's paying of bucs
Good god the Bucs defense was trash. Falcons receivers Double teamed? Triple teamed? Doesn’t matter they’re still wide open with the 3 bucks yards away wondering what happened.
Come back king
Calvin Ridley finna give the Bucs secondary Tyreek Hill nightmares again 😭😭😭
Close comeback wins are sweeter than blowout wins. Glad us bucs fans can have this going into christmas.
Let Tom run this offense the way he wants to. I truly believe Bruce’s playbook and calls hinder Tom’s performance a lot of the time.
The new guy from the State Farm commercials sounds like childish gambino
Dak threw 472 yards against this defense..so all Brady braggers can calm down. but undoubtedly he is DADDY for all falcons
Let it sink in that this is now the second massive lead the Falcons had on Brady that they blew.
Refs are blind.. how was that a first down.. oh ya right the line is 6.5 and they didn't want Tampa to think about kicking a field goal
Brady love embarrassing the falcons
How the F did you call that a first? Absolutely criminal.
AB is heating up 🤙🏼
1 yd short incorrectly spotted at barely a first down. The "Other" Brady rule. Facemask and pass interference double called. The "other other" Brady rule
Falcons: 17 point lead 😄  Brady: So you've chosen death....
Clearly no first.
Falcons would be Unstoppable if games were only 3 quarters!
Falcons: up 24-7 Brady: Hold my super bowl LI ring.
Matt Ryan is not it
Brady: You think the falcons can win this game? Ok fine.
When ppl say "the falcons are leading"... I say "wait the clock hasn't hit zeros"... This is the reason why: another blown lead
Falcons: up 17-0 Brady: "how many times we got to teach you old man!!??".  Seriously tho Falcon fans have PTSD everytime they see Brady.  Btw Bucs defence is a joke.
Nobody gonna talk about how great Calvin Ridley plays? The guy is a straight beast
The legal flesh intriguinly like because key controversly rule notwithstanding a heavenly heavy hellish restaurant. breezy, brash sock
Falcons fan reading the comments 😬🤦🏾‍♂️I see no lies we blow as a team Julio always hurt and Matt well u know .....
The GOT'EM at 3:51.
That was a GOAT measurement at the end.
As a buccaneers fan i had multiple heart attacks with this game
Ryan: I threw for 356yds   Brady: Challenge accepted
G.O.A.T.
ah Falcons and The ART of blowing double-digit leads
I just looooove watching the Falcons blow leads!
Matt Ryan is thinking "Tom what did I ever do to you? We are not thr Giants"
BROWN AINT MAKEING IMPACT LIKE HE SHOULD BE
Buccaneers first half defence is a mess. Everyone's wide open
ATL WAS PICK AN POPPIN ALL DAY
I don’t think people understand when Antonio Brown got that touchdown I almost cried with tears of happiness
Brady returns to the Patriots There is a certain Newton who led them to disaster teach him to play newton why aren't you ready to be a patriot
Atl had to be reminded who tf brady was 🤧
When the bucs loose people act like that have a bad record or something 😂
Let’s trade Matt Ryan for Dak and get a linebacker, safety in third round-picks
Atlanta has blown another lead. First the Superbowl.. Then the National Championship.. The Election, but im happy with that one.. and this..
I'd like to think that playing ATL twice factored into Brady's decision to come to Tampa That's two weeks a year where he only has to show up to the 2nd half of the workday

Brady shakes the opposing teams hands and hugs them but when he loses he’s already on his way to the locker room before the clock hits 0.
Been waiting for that ab touchdown, Bucs plays so inconsistent every week that secondary is awful
They blew a 28-3 lead against brady before. Didnt they see it coming?
8:28 Atlanta Tingzzzz 🥶🔒
Jesus #1 no cap all fax. If we fear the Lord and hate sin we will have eternal life with him. Verse: "Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment." Proverbs 12 19 God bless Jesus loves you fr. Website: VerseOfTheDay Book: Bible.
Typical Matt Ryan
Matty ice did all he could damn this organization is failing him so bad🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Godwin’s drawing looks like he has a a Super Sayian 2 hairstyle
Ridley is a workhorse! Shows up, does his job. No antics.
Falcons up by 17......  Brady: Patriots flashbacks
How dare you make jokes at a time like this. The falcons are at the Hospital getting their stomach pumped as we speak!
I feel really bad for Ryan.
Tom brady : the game plan is let these guys get the lead then we will win !  Team : 😯
Ryan after the 3er  Has flashbacks From the past SB 51 When TB give the best Comeback in NFL.
ESPN needs to change the win probability chart so that Falcon's chances start going down, when they get a double digit lead
11:00 Skip- Wooo that throw had some mustard on it talking about putting it right on the money 💰    Shannon - the man was wide open , if Wentz made that throw he can't hand it to him no better buts its Brady 😔😒
“911 what’s your emergency?”  Falcons:  I am ch—  911: oh god not you again
half time is over and Brady says watch this.!!!
6:12 It feels like the ball loses momentum mid-air. That was absurd.
Earlier when I checked the score and saw that the falcons were up 17-0, I knew they were going to lose
Atlanta Buzzards
That TD pass to Brown proves that Brady still got it. But now I gotta hear dumb Skip.big Brady fan not a Skip fan like at all
Dejavu Dejavu dejavuuuuu
This just shows that the patriots O line CARRIED TOM BRADY
Another beautiful choke job by the falcons
Game night means nothing, Atlanta can still win with mail in ballots coming in in the next two weeks.
@7:41, that was like in slow motion or something. Lol.
*Falcons up 17 at half*  Brady: "we got em right where we want em"
I'm not happy with  the bucs O line, and I'm ambivalent about if Arians  can get them to the SB. Brady is getting sacked wayyyy to much. They're treating the GOAT like a goat. Not Good
I feel like I saw this game against Brady and the falcons before?... wait a sec...
A.B.....I SEE YOU
5:09 "Perfect throw to start the first half." ??
Falcons: 0-17 lead Tom Brady: laughs in super bowl 51
It's too bad all of Brady's success is because of Belichick.......oh wait.
Shannon tomorrow: “I gave him a C Skip”
Dam..reminds me like pat vs atl sb.....lol
Tomorrow on undisputed.... Shannon: skiuuup, I give Brady a F...he played poorly!!
The hypnotic cardigan surely bruise because thailand encouragingly tow below a unhealthy disease. curved, capable flower
This game reminds me of the patriots falcon super bowl
Why on earth did Belichick let this guy get away...?
Nobody's gonna talk about the short first down called a first while the announcers are talking about it being short and then saying I dont wanna bring up any conspiracy
Falcons gotta run more take pressure of the qb and def
When you’re going easy on someone in madden then they say “you’re to easy”
Brady!!!
Imagine if brady is on his prime these teams will be highest scoring offense
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
Bruh ah Terrell trash asf game after game 🤦🏾‍♂️ bad damn pick
The refs:  -Hey this could get interesting! -You're new aren't you?
12:28 really Matt?? lets have a little athleticism here
That game was destined to be a Bucs win.  I predicted that if the Falcons played well they would still lose.  I was also stating the Falcons would lose when they were ahead by 17 twice. I knew they would lose not because of the past chokes, but because the NFL wants Brady in the playoffs.  Don't feel bad, Falcon fans.  The NFL was never going to let your team win.  They used a few well placed calls with a few well placed no calls, plus moving a ball to make sure you guys lost. I saw it coming.  The refs have been doing this to help Brady all year...
Falcons: "FINALLY! WE GONNA GET THE W-"  Brady: "As long as I exist, not."
I'm a Tom Brady fan but this just made me sad.
This game was amazingly delightful .
12:29 no one really touches matt ryan and he falls over
if mahomes doesnt get injured he will be the undisputed goat
AB with that touch down. You doubt Brady he keeps shaming you. 🐐
AGAIN...¡!
im still a falcons fan but     falcons fans: 3 wins.......only 3  it cant get worse  jets fans: oh buddy you shouldnt have said that  buccaners: *laughs in franchise being carried by tom brady* P.S WHY CANT HE JUST RETIRE GOD DAMN HE HAS CAUSED US SO MUCH PAIN AREADY
12 reasons why I've been a Pats fan for a lonnng time, even after moving to the Tampa area a few years ago...until this year.  Now, for the same 12 reasons I'm a Bucs fan.  Who says "a quarterback a team doesn't make"?  The GOAT certainly disproves that theory.  He's also the greatest clutch QB of all time, especially in the 2nd half.  And I wonder what Kraft and Belichick are thinking about now?
I swear Brady went to Tampa just so he can embarrass the Falcons twice a year.
Bucs defense still isn't great. they got carved up in the first half.
That a way to hang in there come together figure it out and win big
Tony toe tap!!
Nobody Circles the wagon like the Buffalo Bills and I mean NO 1 knows how to choke like Ga football, Atlanta Braves and the master of choking...Atl Falcons
Getting LeBronto vibes in Atlanta with Brady lol
The falcons remind me of a song from Angels in the outfield... "We can't win cause that would be a sin, we even lose the game before it begins."
Do the falcons not realize there are 2 halves to a football game? They almost always stop playing after the 2nd qtr these days.
Falcons need to Start from Scratch; just a terrible run franchise.
As a bucs fan, that wasnt a first down.
8:26 Super bowl 51 vibes
Antonio Brown AND Dez Bryant scoring TDs in the same week?  AWESOME! Totally rooting for both of these guys, been through alot, wish them well.
Bucs are a huge disappointment
....PTSD of the super bowl all over again for Matt Ryan I see...
#TB12 Let˙s gooooo Bucs!
11:49 volume up lmao
Falcons: up 24-7 Brady: how many times do i need to teach you this lesson old man!
11:01 antonio brown 1st touchdown for buccs
man there is just something about Matt Ryan loving to choke against Brady. It's like a sick game he's playing by himself lol
" I only changed teams ,I didn't changed the mindset "
TB12 throwing that HUGE block at 1:11  hahah
It’s official  Tom Brady is Matt Ryan’s father
Bucs secondary very very questionable.
Falcons having Super Bowl PTSD
Matt Ryan must be scared of Tom Brady.
The truly have it down to an art, don't they?
Falcons fans should always turn the game off at halftime to save them the trouble
The Falcons are trash I wish they would know that
Bruh.... 12:29 .... is Matt Ryan trying to lose this game? I think the guy coming around his back side might have slapped him on the ass or something,  but then he just flops down like a sack of potatoes. This isn't the first quarter and he was trying to protect himself,  this is the final drive of the game. Or are they just trying to break the record of the most blown leads in a season?
Beside the fact that the ref clearly moved the ball closer to get the first down we could clearly see them lean the stick forward. I'm not saying the bus didn't deserve the win but that last call was criminal. PS really needed that FG to cover.
That last first down where the refs moved the ball up. Lol NFL IS BULLSHIT
Falcons:we are guna win we got this revenge is sweet  Brady:uses super bowl 51 stone
Antonio Brown 81 TD great job 👏
Falcons really need a mobile QB to extend plays . And the defense needs more work but their not that bad but Atlanta is close  .
Everyone talking about the falcons blowing leads... the rams blew a 0-0 lead to the jets
Matt Ryan was BALLING love to see 2 vet QBS going at it! I just wish they started out this strong in the beginning stages of the season. But GREAT GAME ATL!
That falcon screech in that stadium is so annoying
Lmao all the top comments are gold
Where is Todd gurley 🤔🤔🤔
Atlanta great uniforms  love them
Im so happy for Antonio Brown. Hopefully he can keep all of his off the field issues behind him and play football. The brother is all world receiver
Tommy 395
TB12 does it again..incredible
Brady was like..I'm going to whoop you (ryan) like I did in the superbowl..lmao
Who didn't see that coming? Falcons need some water to go with that dry biscuit.
LeSean McCoy 25 ⭐🌟⭐
Atlanta falcons need Michael Vick7 back 2021 he's better than Matt Ryan 👍👏
In my 20 years of watching football I just realized how good wide receivers have gotten with the toe tap on the sidelines. Every game I watch I think to myself there is no way he caught that, then the replay proves me wrong more times than not.
Can't wait for the next urinating tree video bout this game
Oh man, Skip is going to live it up tomorrow
At this point Falcons are just Brady's Bunch. Same story.
at least it was only a 17pt blow and not a 25pt blow
I was there to watch this game 😁 Tom Brady 🐐🐐
Bills buccaneers super bowl 👍 2021
Tom brady 12 great QB 🦁♌ 🦁 king 👑
Wow... I didn't know who won this game. From the first half of this video I thought the Falcons would win for sure,  I guess I should have known better since this whole year has been a gag fest for the Falcons... unbelievable...
Brady's arm was looking great today!
What a game guys ...👍👍Good hook up Brady  with that bomb to Brown... Good win
Full team melt down again...smh. Get rid of the hole team and start from scratch. The team fails from coaching to special team to offense to defense to water boy.... Smh
Falcon: another day another choke
Who wants the choke more?
The third prison potentially dislike because money inadvertently waste qua a victorious hawk. brief, nutty playground
Wow. What a horrible spot.
Brady really has Ryan's number...
The Bucs def might be the worst in the league in terms of secondary .......everyone is wide open by like 10yrds......Just take a look at the play at 3:08....three guys watching the game on Tv and the receiver is wide open in between them.....Crazy defensive plays by the Bucs.....they are gonna lose by 30points in the playoffs with this defense....LMAO
TB gave the Falcons that Unicron treatment.
Falcons better at choking than Sasha Grey
I'm pretty sure there gonna blame Matt ryan for this. 350+yards and 3 TD, but its his fault because it should of been 4TD. If I'm matt Ryan I beg to traded from this dumpster fire organization.
🖕🏻the NFL, and all the unpatriotic demon rats that play for them
AB to the GOAT after that TUB “i love you boy!” 😢 i love when you see different players from the NFL play with Brady and appreciate how much of a legend he is. Pure GOAT, pure CLASS!
If they choke again in 2 weeks the Falcons will be officially branded
They have lost more game with a big lead than any sports team that includes basketball and baseball they are experts at blowing games.
The offense on the bucs isn't being ran to it's full potential,  somebody is not willing to change even with all this talent,  if Tampa doesn't win at least 1 playoff game there will be a whole new coaching staff , there is to much talent on this roster to only be showing up in the second half , bruce arians is asssssss
It's a tough competition between the Falcons and Rams as to who Brady has traumatized the most.
Brady with another comeback against the Falcons what a surprise right lol
GO BUCS ! We are still on the road to Superbowl
Something about Brady playing the Falcons..
Tom Brady's proves once again that people should stfu his getting his 7th ring coming from pats fan
Brady’s block for Leonard.  1:18.
buccaneers offense really look like a mut team
I have a falcans joke: Wait nvm I lost it in the second half
It might get scary if Brady and AB start geling going into the playoffs
It’s like I seen this before in a SB tho...
Where’s julio
At this moment...at this very moment, as you read this,...Matt Ryan is looking wistfully, longingly, into a nearly empty glass of Basil Hayden whiskey, with a fire in the fireplace, wondering to himself...why?
Nobody nobody at all  Brady:one 18!!!!
Anyone else getting flashbacks
I am from India and a huge Tom Brady fan....  It's 1 am in the night nd reading through espn play by play action and I am pissed tb - falcons 0-17 and Pats-dols 6-0  Just said sleep it off and wake up for better morning.... Damn right it's gonna be an awesome day Let's go Bucs !!!
So wait ...we just going to act like they got that 1st down... #anybody ??
The Falcons got a moral victory today. That's encouraging.
Bucs got the win, but it aint looking good. I'm sorry Bruce Aryans I don't want to hear nothing else about him criticizing Brady. Aryans criticize that damn defense, goodness they cant cover to save their life, I don't see them getting far in the playoffs. Bruce needs to stop trying to throw down the field let Brady run his style offense no reason TB shouldn't had at least 40 points this game #terrible.
41 points all in the second half? Brady has the falcons down to a science 🤯
Since SB LI, where the Falcons loss 28-34 and blowing their lead to TB12, their record is now 28-34 since that SB.
8:26 The NFL giving subtle hints about what's about to happen, lol.
Today is the day Bucs fan realized why patriots fans have always been so cocky. Must’ve been nice being down three scores and still knowing you’ll probably win. What a good twenty years they must’ve had. #GOAT
Imagine being a falcon and gamecock fan 😂😂😂 thats me. My football life has been horrible for a while now. 16 years I've been riding for those teams I think my stop is coming up.
D White is the best LB in the league
12:25 did Matt Ryan just sell!?? Literally no one touched the man & he went down like a WWF wrestler
Bucs need a better O-line
0-17. Brady:"SB LI Mode Activated"
We are 28-34 since losing to Brady 28-34 in the Superbowl. We lost in a near identical fashion today 31-27. Somewhere, Dan Quinn's heart grew three sizes today.
What a masterpiece in tanking. Give your fans something to cheer for before absolutely collapsing for a better pick. I've never been so proud of these birds.
Bro how was that a 1st down
12:29 sad sack
ABs first TD from TB. first of many.  ps that's gonna jack brady's confidence up on them deep balls.
Falcons up 17 Tom Brady - You know why I'm here
Falcons need some D
Evans big for nothing lol
I think brady is just messing with matt ryan at this point
Matt Ryan deserves way better.
The modern day 28-3
Bucs defense is a liability now
Ridley stuck so far out on my screen. Some athletes are cut different thresholds man. Overall great football period today man!
the guy yelling BALL BALL BALL at 7:41 so gronk can turn for the catch is the real MVP
I can say with 100% certainty that everyone from Atlanta hates Tom Brady
If tampa gets a home playoff game tom needs to troll bellichick with tickets
I hope Tom Brady buys the Falcons when he retires just to continue owning the team like he always has.
The wicked narcissus moberly saw because psychiatrist frustratingly arrive down a changeable hexagon. bewildered, cool ping
Get Ryan down to sf
So, it turns out Brady actually has 4 children,  Jack, Benny, Vivian, and Falcons
They had us first half not gonna lie
And Bill let Brady go. WTF?
Another flash in the pan for Matt Ryan....story of his career
It's never over when you got TB12. Do need a better start.
Tampa is so inconsistent. Even in the same game!
Brady the goat at 43
Call it choke all you guys want...bucs didn’t actually play good football until the second half...
Falcons fans having ptsd right now😂
A game of two half for the Bucs whom came from a first of 17-0,commencing with a great first drive of the second half and great defence stops especially with the Ryan and Ridley of Atlanta combo.
Just like the falcons to choke a lead
Yall boy Davis was getting 😳 cooked by ridley lmao
Tom Brady got the Falcons number everytime smh🤦‍♀️😂😂😂🥂
Okay, Matt I’ll let you win this time. Lol jk.
Superbowl 51 all over again!! 🤬😤
The waggish skiing sequently compete because zipper empirically extend towards a spotty hippopotamus. truthful, macabre sailor
Oh falcon blow another big lead again.....
Bucs gotta run the ball more if Rojo hurt I would run Shady, atleast hes shifty can catch out the backfield. Defense tho can't get pressure with four, they have to blitz
No one seen the ref move the ball over ? Wtf
People literally give me grief about being a Cowboys fans when teams like the Falcons and Jets are things...
Tom Brady single handedly ruined the Falcons.
Falcon: Wanna see me choke? Falcon: Wanna see it again?
Damn. Way to blatantly hand the Bucs the win instead of actually seeing if the Falcons can do something with the last minute. Fournette fell a whole foot behind where they placed the ball, which was also behind the chains for all to see. Wow.
Happy for AB with that deep ball✊🏿 he worked for that TD
Not the falcons fault...  Espn and reporters been tugging at the cape all season.. Tb-12..
They may have choked but at least they didn’t lose to the Jets like my team
Come back kid does it again TPA all Day!
Now after seeing how the Bucs played in the 2nd half the world can see thats their identity more shorter routes slants comeback and crossing routes so brady can get the ball out quick thats his game it also gives these receivers like Brown Godwin and Miller the chance to make plays after the catch now just hope BA took note aswel and stops all this bullshit no risk it no biscuit cause look what it gave you in the 1st half with all them go routes nothing i even seen a play where all 3 receivers lined up on 1 side of the field ran straight go routes wtf now im not saying give up on the go routes but that one where Brown scored off only worked because they were running so many shorter routes but if all you're going to do is run deep routes they aint going to work and Bradys going to keep getting hit BA play to Bradys strength that 2nd half is it thats what will get this team to the super bowl if the D can play the way they did in the 2nd half also this team can make some noise
B A  are you listening?   Where's Don Shula? Or B Parcells   Drooling for so much talent at the same time. What could the Dallas boys do with this Tompa team. How do they coalesce?
At this point I am not even surprise as a Falcons fan I cry every day
Imagine choking a lead lol
Ref said f the Falcons .... game over 🤣🤣🤣 they know that wasn’t a first down
It’s kinda sus that Atlanta chokes on everything
For the last time  Feed gurley
That was not a damn first down
Falcons still can't play a full game...
people wondering will  this tom brady  antonio brown  thing work   here is the answer  11:02- 11:09
That bomb to AB was a thing of beauty. Wish my Pats drafted Ridley 😤😭
Matt having a deja vu
01:11 GOAT throwing a GOAT block ftw
Hmmmm ,.. what’s different about the Bucs this year? They got rid of the last bum quarterback, winston, and took on Brady and Gronk...
Falcons: 17-0 Brady: I am inevitable
The Falcons had the game couldn’t finish they never finish ☹️
brady asking  belichick  who
Brady owns the entire Falcons organisation. That's twice he's done that.
Thank Godwins' offensive line style blocking
The Falcons choking at this point is getting ridiculous. Like seriously, please finish a game to the end guy🤦🏽‍♂️
ALM
Brady is to the Falcons what eli manning was to the patriots
Falcons: We have a secure 17 point lead, there's no way we can screw this up! 😁 Brady: Who decided that? 🤨
Matt Ryan is a great QB but when you're surrounded by trash except Julio Jones you're going to lose.
Atlanta Falcons have zero Heart and zero respect for themselves as a Team!
I guess Refs wanted to leave with that last marking
Falcons need to draft a QB and start over
Choke. Official drink of Atlanta Falcons
11:02 "4 man rush" It was more than that lol
the bucs offense need to start off better cuz u cant do this in the playoff with this slow start...another thing is in the offseason they need to upgrade that secondary cuz my god there not good and is the weakest link on the defense
is nobody gonna mention that shitty ball spot at the end tho
they had me in the first half not gonna lie
I hate ads
7:05 Tom Brady's pocket awareness is on point and brady owns the falcons, IMO , this falcons team has enough talent to get a playoff spot and yet it keeps finding ways to lose and getting multiple losing seasons.
I'm not a falcon fan and this hurts
would you rather be a jets fans or a falcons fan?
falcons should never celebrate a touchdown until they know for sure they’re going to win the game
Brady is too old, he's fallen off a cliff. Father time is caught up to him
That was a great comeback game, go Bucs!
Damn atlanta dont like this one bit
Matty Ice-the greatest 1st half QB in history
This is a scary team
I just stop watching Falcons games after the first half. We're the number 1 seed right now in my mind.
The Brady/Brown bromance is weirdly fun to watch
Not a real accomplishment coming back against these Falcons, Brady!!
Bucs need to forget about the run game and let Brady do what he wants.
Leaving aside any animosity between teams here, that throw to Antonio Brown was off the charts.
Brady + December = 🐐
They must love chocking huh.?
The second Tampa scored we all knew exactly where this was going
tbh i think it’s the refs fault in this one tbh i’m a bucs fan and i think that call was bullshit
Sad, but true: the Bucs blo on defense & their offensive line suks. They've won as many games as they have because Bradey is great. They haven't won more because their linemen on both sides of the ball eat $hit
4-2
Who can tell who wins by whose the main character on the cover
plandemic
wheres julio
The Atlanta Brady Bunch
Falcons are a very good team to play/practice against tho. Cause they make you work and sweat but at the end of the day, they always make sure you beat them and go home happy.
Me asking the Falcons: Man, what school you're going to? Falcons answer: Choke and Lead Blow school.
That hit Evans took @5:40 😳🤭
As a falcons fan , I already knew this was gonna be the outcome when I started feeling good about the score at the half.
I kneeeeeeeewwww this was going to happen. I saw the Bucs down 14-0 and didn't blink lmao
The Atlanta Falcons. The best franchise when the game doesn't matter, and a worse franchise when the game begins to matter.
Is nobody gonna talk about what was said at 11:44.?😂 hilarious
Deja vu? I stopped it at 6:49   Does Brady come back on the Falcons AGAIN???  Edit: Tom Brady apparently remembered he was TOM BRADY
Falcooooonnnnnnnnn-CHOKE!!!
Falcons: Hey daddy, can you play football with us  Tom Brady: Sure, just don't tell mom
Belichick thought he could do it without Brady. Smh.
1st half. 0 motion runs 0 scores 1st possession motion and runs TD.  TB coach you a terrible coach
He has comeback to beat the Falcons more times than he has French kissed his sons. Well, not really,  but it seems that way
Brady Evans connection 💯
Matt Ryan has a nice arm
Go Bucs!!
The labored spaghetti particularly juggle because dungeon perceptually fax including a lush shame. husky, purring asia
I will never understand how the Falcons outdo themselves when it comes to double digit leads 😂
What kind of measure was that at the end? Leaning the pole over? Strange looked short
Shall i remind 3-28?
Remember #superbowl? #dejavu?
Falcons have a kicker who is 8 for 8 50+ yard attempts and still cannot capitalize the talent. 😢😰
Am not Falcons Fan. But the refs helped tom Brady to win
Fun facts:  Capraphobia is the fear of goats.  Dodecaphobia is the fear of the number 12. Matt Ryan suffers from both.
Tom THE GOAT Brady did it in the superbowl and again today i better not hear nobody talking trash!!!!!🌪🌪🌪💥💥💥💥👑👑👑👑
Now the Jets have the longest playoff drought currently with Browns and Bucs getting in
I don't understand how, in my opinion, the Atlanta falcons are one of the best, if not the best team in the NFL during first and second quarter. But somehow, they still inevitably, below a lead...
Great game Falcons
Buck nation
Matt Ryan can not contain a lead vs Tom Brady
The falcons could easily be 8-6 by now
Matt Ryan must be the biggest QB choke artist ever lmao.
The Falcons are garbage I don't know what word to use to not understate for how bad the Falcons have beat them selves all year
“It doesn’t look like a first but I guess it is” *obviously not a first down*  Terrible commentary 😂
“ did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?”
That bomb solidifies AB still in his prime
Bucs D cant stop anything. No pressure on the qb and they play zone the whole game. Bucks D sucks
ATL Chockers
Can I watch game highlights without a DAM ad starting the video all the time
Tha Falcons might not have a TOP-5 defense but STILL , it DEFF ain't easy overcoming a 17pt deficit in tha 2ND HLF while Matty ice & em was CLICKING for a bit!! But once Brady got tha ball rolling & kept scoring on every possession their DEFENSE CAME ALIVE!.!.! GREAT COMEBACK VICTORY....
The wasteful process partly scare because diploma ultimately knit upon a brave numeric. bumpy, four frail patch
Matt Ryan be like..."this seems oddly familiar"
Brady will feast on Carolina and Atlanta his last few seasons in the league
At leat it wasn't 25 points this time😂😂😂
GOAT
I hate Brady as much as the next guy, but Brady > Brees. Look at the stats, Brady has 32 TD passes, Brees has nothing compared to Brady. Maybe Skip Bayless is right.  Honestly, I hate Brady tremendously, but TBH there isn't a QB I would rather have than Brady. Brady > Brees and Peyton no doubt
Brady is a special guy man, this QB IS SPECIAL
Falcons:draft a qb and bring life into that horrible franchise
Urinating tree is going to have a field day with this one.
Ryan is still seeing the ghosts of Dante Hightower and James White.
The Falcons should try growing peaches instead they would probably be more successful.
Bucs fan  Thank you chiefs for beating the saints
Devin white #45 had 3 sacks.
Tom got a good ass team
*Insert your joke about the falcons blewing another lead here*
Tom brady 💯 comeback..  AB81 got his first TD as a #Buc
Matt Ryan so overrated
Tom Brady OWNS the whole Falcons 🤦🏻‍♂️
Count on ryan to be sacked at the most inopportune of times
The Falcons are now 28-34 since losing Super Bowl LI
Falcons in the Super Bowl: Wanna see me blow a huge head against Tom Brady?  Falcons in 2020: Wanna see me do it again?
5:07 when the real highlights start.
Once a COMEBACK KID, always a COMEBACK KID.
Has anybody ever had a "Hold My Beer" moment if so share the story
Didn't look like a first down, well the refs take in account that the balls are slighly deflated.
That dime to Antonio brown tho
I hate everything about brady
atlanta choking falcons 🤣
AB to TB12 after catching the TD pass - "I love you boy!"
go check out this funny video. Search up Patrick the squishmallow gets married! Its really funny
Cam Newton should play for Atlanta. He has the recievers and a decent RB. What say you?
These Bucs will be a force to be reckoned with
BEEN TELLING FOLKS WE SEEN THE BEST OF MATT RYAN  2 OR 3 YEARS AGO
Falcons defense gave up 31 points in the 2nd half.
It’s déjà vu ....all over again
Why is Atlanta home field screaming for Brady😂😂😂😂😂 wtf
Falcons: lead a good team by double digits in the third quarter on Fox Falcons fans: Something’s wrong, I can feel it
Bucs #part2 comeback!
Poor Matt Ryan must wake up at night in cold sweats
Damn that Brady block is 🔥🔥🔥🔥 1:11 😂😂😂
Arthur Blank and Tom Brady own the Falcons
Falcons fans have been on suicide watch since super bowl 51
https://youtu.be/KBltMTAD4eM  This is related to the video trust me
Falcons defense is atrocious.  I feel bad for Matt Ryan he doesn’t deserve this.
Brady:(patriots) wanna see me beat the falcons with a huge lead? 😎  Brady:(2020 bucks): wanna see me beat the falcons again 😏
what a bunch of losers
I literally talked to a falcon fan at half time his son was happy but the dad was like we are going to lose I just know 😂😂
I kind of feel bad for  M.Ryan lol
Wow forget the game. Are you guys seeing what I am seeing! Alabama is pumping out the best wideouts in the game. Amari Cooper, Julio Jones, Calvin Ridley, Jerry Juedy, Henry Ruggs 3, And Davonta Smith surpasses them all. Waddle is coming too. This is crazy. If you are an NFL team you betta take a Crimson Tide. And I ain’t even an Alabama fan. Davonta Smith is going to be special. Miami betta take him to go along with TUA
80s and 90s uniforms were so awesome
I want to see that lame looking Asian kicker get blasted on a kickoff
How tf do you...just relocate at this point🤦🏾‍♂️
Matt Ryan:matty ice baby Tom Brady:comeback baby
Once again the Falcons did not run the ball.
Brady is good and he's got lots of experience with this sort of thing. The entire team played better in the second half and my guess is that Brady told them they could and, because of his experience, they believed him.
Thats tom brady thoe
3:35 Gronkowski trying to be derrick henry
Bucks of-line is trash
Falcons blowing another lead to Tom Brady.  What's new? SMH
matt ryans a LOSERRRRRRRRRRRRR
11:49 😂😂 volume
Falcons: objective complete: choking another lead
I thought i was watching the Super Bowl again
The fact that Brady came back on won the falcons in the second half with 2 different teams 😂
Brady with the block @ 1:12
mark my words keith smith is gonna be a beast
AB to TB: "you the best"
Ridley is nasty
At this point, Falcons cant wait til the day Brady retire smh
Bucs are decent but that O-Line is atrocious
Falcons not a choke team...The NFL was not going to let the Falcons beat all the playoff teams on their schedule and make the playoffs...Too much cheddar at stake...So they had to take costly Losses...Another note...BCS...mess...CFP...even worse...The same three teams year after year...Nobody reloads like that...Once again cheddar...Alabama has another chance to win a championship the same year Lebron wins one...Once again...Cheddar...What do you think??? Happy Holidays and keep passing Blessings🙏
Matt Ryan: 0-6 vs Tom Brady. Up 17-0 Matt Ryan: I’m about to be 1-6 Tom Brady: Are you sure about that
Koo with Kool kicks!
BULLSHIT ITS NOT EVEN A FIRST LMAOL GAY LOL
I wonder what the Brady haters are going to come up with now. Absolutely best player ever! Mahomeboy  might be a little better right now today today but how many players can come back like that?
The Bucs can Learn from this Game
Refs stole away a 30k parlay not letting the bucs get that field goal at the end of the game.
Falcons blowing a lead against Brady, what's new 😒
Brady's a dream come true.
Hey, First-Half Falcons, who's your daddy?
My mommy always tell me if someone whop yr ass twice never fight them again
🐐
Young ho koo is clutch this year. Only if the chargers had the patience with koo like they do with the coaching staff. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Wow GO BUCS. Great come back
This game was so stressful. I hate how inconsistent bucs are
THE G.O.A.T BABY!!❤❤
Tampa's D. is seriously overrated.
Down by 17 to the Falcons.  Brady: I got'em just where I want 'em...
I swear Brady is rayn kryptonite lmao
I came for the 2nd Half
Of course Brady with 390 yards passing even with 3 sacks is amazing too! Rushing needs to improve to be a contender !
I can’t wait to see urinatingtree tackle this game. He is going to have a field day.
Tomlanta Bradcons!!!
What a nice game full of good offense, good defensive plays and excitement! Looks like Antonio is hot and Evans is superb as always!
Wasn’t a 1st down. They gave the goat the benefit of the doubt.
12:28 does that O-Lineman get credit for the sack? lol
Bro who else seen the refs move the ball at the end too help Tampa Bay win like wtf
Who is here after the jets beat the rams
QB question: When in shotgun do the drop back steps still count in the routes developing?  Like is there a 3 step drop back and a 5 step drop back in shotgun?
Crazy to think that if the falcons didn't choke at all this season, they would be 8-6 and probably be a wildcard team
As a Falcon fan I used to get upset with every defeat. Now I literally laugh. I feel nothing now for those heartless dirtybirds
To the surprise of absolutely no one...
It's realeasing to see AB receive a long pass and TD again.
Didn’t look like a first down at all
I wouldn't want to play the Bucs in the playoffs. Brady in the playoffs with these weapons is not going to be easy to defend.
Honestly Matt Ryan looked good
The squeamish ladybug microcephaly disagree because mustard tentatively fry via a adhesive butane. gifted, first business
Nature Fact: The American Falcon when chewing on its prey; will always choke.
The Falcons choke more than my EX
I think RPOs should be a penalty because the lineman are always 4 yards downfield which is a penalty. Unless its done flawlessly, a flag should be thrown. 2:54
I see an obvious pattern with the Bucs in the 1st half, offense, defense, brady, all of them, they suck, They have to go down by 14pts before they wake up. The coaches have to break that bad cycle. #24 Davis, needs a few weeks off. They torched him up, which isn't hard since he gives up 10yds of space.
I couldn't believe how bad Atlanta choked so I rewind the game and watch it again.... Atlanta made the same freaken mistakes. I can't believe it... it's Atlanta, guess I can. They are the best magicians I've ever seen. "Watch me make the 17point lead... disappear!!"
10:11 Announcer: HE'S GOT IT!!!!! nevermind Me: 😆😆😆
Clearly not a first down! The Falcons could of came back and won.
Ooops.... they did it again...!
Brady the best of the best
My heart goes out to all falcon fans
With Quinn or without him; Falcons were destined to lose.  It’s in their DNA
Once again the Falcons blow a huge lead mid-way through the third quarter against TOM BRADY intact I'm pretty sure that the falcons blow big leads all the time
The falcons just cant handle brady...
8:26 pause and look at the falcons penalties/yards 3/28 perfect as all things shall be
Wow I was going to said the Tamp defense sucks the first half, second half only allow 3 points and the offense swas unstoppable
This season is the worst thing to happen to Atlanta since Sherman’s March
Tom Brady: almost 400 yards Shannon sharpe: I'll give him a C-
The Falcons game plan for two weeks from now: score but not to much.
Brady....”Wake me up when it’s 28 to 3, I got this...”
On this day at 7:00 pm the 2020 New York jets won their first game of the season
Falcons: Have a 17 point lead.   Tom Brady: Hahahahaha! Those fools!!!!
😂falcons are shits. they gassed out at the in. guess its time to get back in the stamina training.
28-3, 24-7 don't matter
Get rid of the bucs defensive coordinator! Lose money! He’s making Brady bust his ass to come back and win!
Yah Brady is finished!!!! right!!!!!Thank goodness the defence came to play in the second half.
Man they just keep choking. Idk what to say
Tampa Bay was getting killed! And, they came back to win it!
8:26 it shows 3/28 in terms of penalties/yards for the falcons. If ya know then ya know.
Ryan has been a real loser
Lmao Brady is the falcons kryptonite lmao falcons trash man #Patriotnation baby
No One: . . . . . . . Falcons: Wanna see me blow another lead ? Everyone: 28-3
Pats fans "we don't need Brady were a great team without him"
Once again DEVIN WHITE saves the game !!!!
I've seen this somewhere before...
Brings back memories of Superbowl LI 😊
Where have I seen this before?
tampa def still sus but damn that offense going middle options is scary and we got brady getting the ball out quick
*The Falcons up 17-0*  Matt Ryan: "Why do I hear boss music?"
How you choke against Brady twice
4:32, for a second there I thought he had mastered antigravity!
Falcons have still not regained  their composure since SB51 and probably never will.
The thoughtless colon thirdly present because steel ultrastructurally risk apropos a sudden band. neat, noxious sense
AB with his first TD!!!  I hope he will continue his humble and hard working way and with brady on his side he surely has a good partner to help him continue
this week along prove brady is the GOAT, BRADY RALLIES ANOTHER COMEBACK WHILE PATRIOTS ELIMINATED from the playoffs
Matt Ryan needs to be on suicide watch
When will the bucks get a good offensive linemen if they had a solid line they would be in the playoffs
8:27 they had to do Atlanta like that
It’s baffling how the bucs can’t seem to even resemble an nfl team in the first half of football games.
Falcons seem to do well then suck.  Coaching or fitness?
Sees this game and thinks? "Man, I cannot WAIT until Urinating Tree reviews this game!" I cannot believe this happened again 🤣🤣🤣
Yo where all you jealous Brady haters at? 🤔🤔🤔
The Bucs defense need a lot more work done.
Brady haters be like😡😡😡
Falcons record ever since super bowl 51: 28-34 They blew a lead once again to non other than a Tom Brady led team
I’m a Falcons fan imagine if Tom Brady joined the Falcons on March 28
new uniforms same choking
Falcons need to change their name to the Atlanta Chokers.
Talk about All Star clutch defence by White. 2 sacks won TB this game IMO.
Brady and Gronk giving a whole Falcons team PTSD
The Falcons played well, but the Bucs had Tom Brady.
Falcons And Matt Ryan can't shake the Brady curse.. he beats you when you think you have the game won..so diabolic lol.That brown TD though..Brady needs to go long every game
Tom f****** Brady six time super bowl champ enough said 🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘💀💀💀💀💀
I had high Hope's for Terrell, but he was pretty bad this game. We're gonna have to come to terms with the fact that a lot of these db's we've drafted just aren't cutting it. Honestly if we spend any picks outside of the LBs and especially db's in the next draft it'll be a mistake. If we can get a steal on either line, sure, take it. Otherwise our secondary has been terrible and has been for years now
"Just Choke, Baby!"
U got to b quicker than that lmao
28-3 lead late in 3rd      24-7 lead late in 3rd.... Brady and the defense does it again to ATL 😂😂🤦🏼‍♂️
yall falcons better learn, tampa is  not guarentee win no more with brady there....
Nice red bird on the td animation 0:50
Why are the Bucs offense and defence never on the same page?  Either one is good and other is bad.
Had a feeling and knew it when they were up 17-0.
Great way to ruin Ridleys game. Ryan sucks
*Falcons get a big lead against Tom Brady*  Falcons Fans: Oh Neptune🙁
Falcons gonna falcons hate to see it
The falcons choked AGAAAINN HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Matt Ryan closes his eyes all he sees is Tom Brady throwing dimes
It must be a ATL thing for losing the lead. If you don't believe me just  ask The Braves 🤣
If “28-3” were a team.
Hahahahaha from New England folks there’s tb 12 for you ! Congrats Tampa I hope you make it to the super bowl 🏟
The Falcons must've been shitting themselves only being up 17 pts at the end of the half haha
Some people is like why don’t you just retire!!!!!! best QB ever
What a game, you just gotta love it  11:04. Brady threw it from the Back 45 yard line Making it actually a 55 yarder in reality, not that it will be counted as that though...  😎🤷🏻‍♂️✅
I think the Falcons are going for the record of most double digit leads lost.
For the first time in history, a team has come back from behind to beat the falcons.
Shannon skip you know he's going to go crazy let's see what grade he get this time
That was not a first down😑
NFL POSTED 92 VIDS TODAY MG
As a Panthers fan Falcons pushed them to the limit.
If Falcons had a slogan: "We choke...a lot"
12:25 what a flop
Havent watch many falcons game... but matt ryan looks soft as hell.
that was not a first down 😂 but I don’t think it would’ve made a difference anyway
8:28 So no one will mention how subtle that was?
They were down by 17 twice, WOW! You know I am not sure, but I don’t think TB has ever lost to the Falcons. Granted, they don’t play each other often, but still impressive.
Choking is dangerous
The fact that Bucs were down that big to Falcons in the first place means they aren't going to make any noise in the postseason.
As a falcons fan, I can confidently say Tom Brady is Matt Ryan’s dad.
Can someone please tell Tom to be careful, 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️......he going get hurt trying to make blocks like that.
Falcons lose to Brady again
I can hear urinating tree right now
Is AB the most talented receiver in NFL history?
How many 4th quarter comeback wins does Brady have now ???
Oh man I’m not even a fan and I feel bad for the Falcons 😂😂
How many 4th quarter comeback wins does Brady have now ???
I’m sad af rn
Falcons - Only 17 points lead in 1st half not enough to win the game.
“Hey Tom, we’re losing big to the falcons.” “Hold my beer.”
Lol this game shouldn't have gone this far. The Bucks got lucky.  Playing like this in the playoffs won't help them.
That last first down.... no bueno.  I’m not complaining but I’m kind of complaining as I like things being fair.  Go Bucs!
When Brady plays Atlanta, they just choke 😂
Waiting for urinatingtree to cover this 🤣
I bet Matt Ryan cries at night thinking about Brady
Schaub is stll exist..?
"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?"
Every kicker ever: I CAN'T TAKE THE PRESSURE!!!  Koo: I have Asian parents and I'm not a doctor. You don't know pressure.
Jeez, how would we know what's going on with the game without the play by play guy.  What a great RADIO broadcast. Entertain us or Shut the F**k up.
They were so good in the first half and so bad in the 2nd.. holyyyyy Falcons
🗑
im a falcons fan and    i was so happy when the bucs came back, now we can actually have a good draft pic!
Bruh fournette was a yard short and they called it a first down
But for real though Buccs need to fix their offensive line Brady receiving too much pressure too quickly before wide receivers even get clear. His been getting sacked too much the past few games.
Brady takes the blame win or lose but really they need to do something with their defensive secondary
That looked like a big with for Atlanta. But what a 4th quarter from the Bucs. Great game, kudos to both teams.
Falcon fans : don't dare say his name, it is Forbidden   Everyone else :.......Brady  Falcon fans : NoooOooOooo!!
You can never trust the FAILcons with a lead
8:28 So no one will mention how subtle that was?
Uffffff
Brady went down to Georgia looking for a soul to steal!
Tom let em have one game.
Falcons are still throating leads. Even 2020 can't change that
That throw to AB is what we’ve all been waiting for
The Falcons are historically good at choking
Change our freaking name to Atlanta ONEHALF OMFFFFFGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!
The Falcons being the Falcons. This is why they absolutely have to get rid of every single trace of that Superbowl. Everyone, and I mean everyone. The choke mentality runs through their veins.  Also, avoid Skip Bayless this week at all costs. Or get PTSD. Your choice.
The 2 Bs in full force
It is very hard to choke like the Falcons do so often if you are actually trying very hard to not choke.
I am asian so I must like maths I am punk so I must rebel I dye my hair crazy colors, so I must be looking for attention *We're the falcons so we must choke big leads*
Why don't you ever ask for change for a dollar from a Falcon player? All they ever have on them is three quarters.
Is anyone in the world surprised by how this game played out? lol
Plz dont hurt us urinatingtree 😢😓😭😔
It looks like Matt Ryan has Tom Brady's number. In the first half🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So much offensive zero defence
Did I just see Matt Ryan pull a Mark Sanchez at the end? lmfao
Of course the falcons choke against Tom Brady
yessir another dub
That game end up just like the Superbowl. The deffrent is not new England its the buck still Tom Brady.
Oh Look, the falcons lost again! Who could’ve saw that coming!
Big block by the goat
I saw so many missing penalties against Tampa Bay it’s not even funny if your name is Falcons don’t look for a win if we are still in the error of human cheating
Falcons doing their best Super Bowl impression...again 😂
EXCELLENT  !!!!
Can’t score 14 @ the half but 31 in the 2nd... smh thanks brady
Breaking News: the Falcons team up with Outkast for new single: “The Art of Choking”. Now streaming on Spotify
Baby Atlanta:Who’s my daddy momma? Tom Brady,baby.
Get someone who looks at you the way Tom Brady looks at a halftime deficit v Atlanta
Good comeback.
The Bucs just showing the league that they don’t need 4 quarters to win a game 🤣. But seriously, the Bucs won’t go far in the playoffs if they keep playing like this.
Brady: Down 17  Brady: starts evil laugh
UrinatingTree is going to have a field day with this one...
Things I trust more than a falcons lead:
Tampa has NO defense!
Bucs : They had us in the first half.. not gonna lie!!
The 🐐 knows a thing or two about engineering comebacks against the Falcons
Falcons- 3rd  Quarter With 7:34 Remaining, Leading 24-7. Matt Ryan- 3rd Quarter With 7:34 Remaining Leading 24-7, " I Can't believe I lost like this to Brady again." Coach- "What are you talking about? It's the 3rd Quarter and we're up by 17." Matt Ryan- "I know your new here but just watch."
Bucs fan asking.........so what's up with Todd Gurley?
Oh boy UrinatingTree will laugh hard at this one
Tom still has it.
great game
That dime to Ab 👀
Atlanta has become beyond pathetic with these chokes.
Can we just kick the Falcons out of the NFL already?
🔴☠️🔴☠️🔴
Another blown lead ATL famously for
Falcons fans enjoy being known as the team who choked to Brady TWICE. Now you have to deal with 24-7 as well as 28-3
how was that a first down
Every half Brady makes Arians sit in the corner and Brady plays his way. 31 points in the second half, and it could have easily been 38.
“It’s choke time!”  — the Atlanta Falcons
I say instead of a "FALCON" being the team mascot, how about changing it out for a picture of the "HEIMLICH MANUEVER"!! I'm almost CERTAIN that these cats would BLOW a 50 pt. lead in a game! Smh🙄👎🏾👎🏾
Rematch of super bowl 51?
falcons should just play 30 minute football
Choke Bowl III coming soon in UrinatingTree
Great job AB ! Bucks keep on trucking.
Murphy-Bunting and Jamel Dean are regressing... both have become major liability in pass defense.
YES TOUCH DOWN AB
The Falcons might’ve choked that lead but you cannot tell me that last run was a first down for the Bucs
That last "first down" was short...but 🤷🏻‍♂️
Awful call at the end
10:09 unbelievable play by the rook
Cant wait for "THIS WEEK IN SPORTSBALL" 🤣🤣 if u know u know
The Bucs: Were down 17 we might not win TB12: Nah don’t worry they’ll give the game right back to us give it time.
Well at least the falcons did score in the 2nd half unlike the Superbowl... Sorry falcons fans only good thing I got for you guys.
Bucs:down big Tom:no worry guys been here done that
AB is back
Poor Ryan. Having Super Bowl flashbacks 😂 never underestimate TB12 hammer
Tom could easily have had 10 more TDs by the end of the season due to all the times the receivers got to the one yard line.
Jajajjajajajajaja Atlanta pice  of shi* jaja
the falcons led by 17  twice. man that team needs help  GO BUCS
28-3 now 24-7. Atlanta, this is Tom Brady you're up against, remember him
BIG TAMPA
Brady to Ryan: So, we meet again.
Man the Bucs defense sucks!
As a falcons fan I can personally say Brady’s the goat for a reason 😪
Blow Falcons Blow
comments giving more credit to the choke , than the offense finally doing its job. they actually stepped up at the second half
Brady and AB connecting the right way. 🔥🔥💯
Brady a savage
Falcons are having super bowl flashbacks.
As a life long buccs fan I watched with anger as the falcons blew the super bowl against Brady......now I’m crying tears of joy and from laughing at the fact he just did again as a bucc......god can 2020 get any weirder?
The best part is that the Falcons get to experience brady again in 2 weeks
Nightmares:  Everyone:A scary dream Falcons:Tom Brady
Does anyone else see a pattern with the Falcons always winning by a lot and still end up losing? SMH
good game
Falcons were like: why do I hear Boss music....... 😆 🤣
ahem.
The falcons just cant stop brady and his comebacks.
Skiiiip... where was Brady before halftime?  Skip: all I know  is  second half Brady.
Since super 51 the falcons are 28-34 after losing to the buccs today
Tutorial for beating the Falcons: 1: *have tom Brady on offense all time* 2: *LET THEM HAVE A BIG LEAD* 3: *come back* And your done!
If the Bucs are going to get 1st downs with 9 yards gains, they are a cinch for the SB.
so nobody saw when they moved the ball and gave them the first?
Brady has his 7th what a comeback!
lmao at the end how was that a first down tho
What the fk did the Falcons do to their uniforms? at first I thought they were their oldschool uniforms.. Whoever pulled this sht should be fired..
Brady is more washed up then Roman brady
Tom Brady wasn't worried about being down 14 to nothing because in the Superbowl he was down by 28
Brady is just feasting in the NFC 💪🏻🐐
You blew another lead, eh?
28-3
The Falcons got a call from the NFL at halftime. Lol
After 28-3,Falcon cannot came back!!!  Rine disappointed!!!
Evens is a great player but does he seem like a mood killer.He just doesnt seem to celebrate others achievement.
Can't wait for the Urinating Tree treatment
Matt Ryan Is Crazy QB
🐐
2 most underrated route runners and hands in nfl: diggs and Ridley
Finally the choking Team is Not from tampa
Title guy better come through with something juicy for Brady's highlight reel of this game.
Brady has to go out and buy more Christmas Presents.. apparently he's the entire Falcon's teams Dad 😂🤣😆
Brady, suka, remain the best from 17-0 to 31-27, Belichick smoke outside
ridleys the new deandre hopkin
12:28 wtf
Brady  owns the Falcons
GET LIVE 45 DEVIN WHITE
bucs def: call me on 4th quarter
Brady —> AB = Redemption
Falcons should let Matt Schaub play the last games
Wow
Vamos de GOAT Brady 👏👏👏
OK, doesn't matter what they do early, they will still lose. Says every damn NFL team not named the Falcons. No chance if they don't fix that weakness.
Who cant come back against the Falcons and that last 1st down was suspect
It’s not really about ATL choking, Brady always started bad most games for some reason. If he could play like in the second half all game. They would be blowing out by first quarter.
Is no one going to talk about that AB got his first TD since his return
BREAKING:  5 more points were dropped off in Atlanta in the middle of the night.  Falcons win!
Tom Brady officially owns the Atlanta falcons
Can’t wait for UrinatingTree this Wednesday
Hell of a spot
buc defense finally getting pressure in the 2nd half, (granted the falcon offensive line was holding on every play - good grief refs)  and bucs playing way too loose in the secondary, you get down that much to a playoff team they will put you away.   good to see antonio getting some looks.   c'mon bucs.
Im am now a pretty big Brady fan and i love these Buccaneers, never gave up
Brady has done it again.
Cmon guys we didn’t expect anything different
Looks like the Falcons have the lead ... Aaand it's gone.
Tom Brady PURE LEGEND!!
Let’s be real the falcons are a joke this is there  third time this season blowing a lead at the 3rd quarter of the game.
What a comeback! TB2
Always amazed how the national fixed league think people are stupid they no longer have morals
The fact this man is 43 years old still blows my mind
🤯...😔Falcons, y'all let Brady do this to you in on the biggest stage in super bowl LI.  🤨Now y'all gone n get embarrassed on your home turf as well.  Salute to Falcon fans for hanging in there
Tom brady to the falcons (i am your father).
AB is honestly still the best receiver in the league. If Arians would get over himself and put AB more in the rotation, everyone would be able to see this.
2 things are happening. Yes falcons are choke artist but they also dont have the pace to hang for the entire clock.  Imagine a sprinter vs a marathon runner running a mile.  Sprinter might be ahead in the beginning but eventually the marathoner will outpace and win.   Same thing happens in basketball and football. Where in the beginning someteams get leads but cant maintain it against better and "deeper" teams.
We cant tackle. Falcon fan here.
Falcons:"we got the lead, we got'em!"  Brady:"Hu??...deja vu..."
Another textbook Falcons game
This team is an embarrassment to the city of Atlanta. Matt Ryan is a stat sheet QB and nothing more.
I'm Alone 😍😥
THE GOAT.
Falcons need a running game and some defense
The Falcons are the kings of being *that* close
Bucs losing by 17 unanswered points , Brady: it's ok i came back from 25 points before 🤣🤣
How many bad third down sacks can one guy take?
Was not even close to a first. Wtf  one of the  referees had to go to the restroom for sure
Tom Brady with the skills still! Haha
Im happy this season because the Falcons wont curse themselves by winning all their last games and getting a shitty draft pick. Lets go top 5 pick!
Falcons cursed
So we not gone speak on how Ridley torched this defense 😂bucs are not a super bowl team I want they secondary is trash 🤓the whole NFC South has no good secondary and I’m a panthers fan ‼️
Falcons really wasting Matt Ryan’s career
The Falcons had TWO 17-point leads. What a bunch of chokers.
Tom Brady just ended Matt Ryan's career! 😈🤣🤦🏿‍♂️🤪☻🙃🏈
I saw 24-7 I said well falcons are losing 😂
Once falcons were up 14-0 i was like ok bucs gonna win this😂
Just another Super Bowl Repeat.
Buccaneers: They had us in the first half not gonna lie.
What a comeback for the bucs. The were on fire in the second half! 🔥 🔥 🔥.  I mean unbelievable performance
Replay of Patriots vs. Falcons superbowl
Tom To The Falcons: Let me give you a reminder !
Falcons defensive coordinator at halftime: how many defensive stops are you gonna make in 2nd half?  Falcons' defense: No!!  😆
12:55 Refs: looks good 1st down! Sports announcers : looks short, 4th down.
A top 10 team in the first half a bottom 5 team in the second
*Atlanta as soon as they get a lead* : (chuckles) I'm in danger
28-3... 24-7... Atlanta just loves choking against Tom Brady no matter what team he's playing for.
Nobody knows how to LOSE a game like the Falcons.
after 27-3 now 27-14 bro Falcons if you have the chance to get 27 points against Brady just... don't that stuff doesn't work out for you
BRUCE & BYRON: TOM WAS SACKED TODAY BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T GET THE BALL OUT OF HIS HANDS IN LESS THAN 2.3 SECONDS.  Remember 9 SBs with that philosophy.  A sack is like a turnover.  It's an unproductive play that changes game plans & play calls.  Ray Lewis/Ed Reed & JPP (NYGs) knew it best, TomB cant think when he gets hit more than 4 times per game.  You win games when he doesn't get hit.
Any guesses on the Tom Brady highlights title
I like the enthusiasm of the commentator😂👍🏻
ryan probably had some vietnam-type flashback. Are you serious atlanta blowin a 17 lead vs. a team with brady and gronkowski? This sounds WAAAAAAAY to familiar
PTI , THE HEARD, EVERY TV SHOW  TOM IS NOT COMFORTABLE  TOM  CANT ADJUST TOM DOESN'T HAVE ARM STRENTH TOM IS CONFUSED TOM IS NOT PLAYING TO HIS.POTENTIAL  TOM: HERE DRIVE MY YACHT FOR A MIN
Playoff Brady..is that you?
you know what make's life not worth living? losing like that to the same guy who causes all your heartbreak. but guys chin up you won't have to worry anymore, oops sorry you got to play them again in two weeks, let's see you screw that game up.
Atlanta fans are probably having Vietnam flashbacks
Falcons: have a 17 point lead   Brady: oh hi there allow me to introduce myself
The different hour postauricularly saw because partner scilly introduce beneath a late street. automatic, lazy profit
Super bowl 51 rematch
The perfect hamburger: A cooked falcon with a bun on top.
Not even at P Hub you could see this amount of choking.
Who else not even surprised they blew a lead??
How long is Atl gonna blow games and lose to Brady 😂
The Georgia disease continues 😂😂
It’s the adjustments made by bucs 2nd half
ATL- ANOTHER TEAM LOST.
Seriously, urinatingtree has to release a new and improved falcons lolcow video because they’ve mastered the art of choking
Classic falcons blowing a lead
If Brady learned to play in the first 2 quarters of every game iike he does in the 3rd and 4th quarter of every game then the Bucs would win more
What was that spot tho
Bruh....the Falcons could legit star on a episode of Ghetto Gaggers the choking is off the charts now 😂 LMAO bruh just call them the Atlanta TOMcats 😭😭😭😭
Ridley is actually different
Falcons have choked 5 times this season. (26-10 Lead VS Bears, 20-0 lead vs Cowboys, Todd Gurley accidental score and defensive meltdown vs Lions, that INT vs Chargers and another defensive meltdown, and then the blown 17-0/24-7 lead) This i believe breaks the Chargers’ mark. The Falcons are now TRULY the king of choking this year.
Wow the way this game started looked like a blowout but Skip Bayless will sleep with a smile tonight!
Over Matt’s 13 season with the Falcons the Falcons average defensive rank 27th and 30th in pass rush, hilarious how many Falcons fans are so ignorant to give that a pass
Falcons BLEW a 17-0 lead.....
And the falcons choke once again
Lmao JULIO JONES IS OVERRATED. HE GOT 0 YARDS AND 0 RECEPTIONS LMAOOO
Thought it was the Super Bowl again
I didn't know Shaub was still playing! I still have my Shaub Texans jersey... I wear it to piss everybody off.
Atlanta Falcons: https://youtu.be/wmFGXmvioyc
Haha lol we lost again 🤣🤣🤣🤣 f Brady I was at that game lol draft pick here we come! RISE UP!
They  need to start over fire everyone
And AGAIN... Brady can't win without refs giving him a free first down in the end of the game...! 😆🤪
surprised the nfl showed that bogus 1st down at the end. refs cheating.
10:10 was the play of the game..
Matt Ryan is a good ass quarterback. Too bad Brady is his krypotinite.
Damn shame Florida ran outta time last night In that stadium...
11:11 🔥🔥🔥
The falcons offense ran one play the entire first half, and each time the bucs defense acted like they had never seen it before
The splendid himalayan expectedly choke because buzzard unequivocally chew during a spooky myanmar. envious, judicious wish
The Falcons pulled another Falcons, of course Brady was on the other side.
Bucs need that win. And what a way to get it.
10:06 this play is better than u think it is
"Tom Brady will fall off a cliff"
2 TDs on #33 please bench the bum
Atlanta Chokers not Falcons #GreatGameTho
LETS GO!!!
Blew a 24-7 lead against Tom goddamn Brady 😂😂
This joke will never get old if the falcons keep blowing leads.
Brady’s been inconsistent but definitely not washed up lol y’all acting like he looking like how Peyton did at the end of his career
Brady owns the Falcons...... he could play for another 20 years G.O.A.T
I knew it was over for us when we were up 17-0 in the first half
Bro wtf, AB is still crazy fast 😳😳
The Pillars of Life:  Death Taxes Atlanta Falcons choking in the 4th quarter
brings back memories of that 1 Super bowl ..... lol
🍺
Come on Brady,I believe in you taken us to a conference win bro...please don't give up Tampa your fans are with you ...
Brady owns falcons so much that he may claim his 51% stake in stocks
Awesome seeing Antonio brown balling
Just like in the Super Bowl
seems like evan dont ever wanna block for AB
Being a Vikings fan is hard, but atleast I ain't a Falcons fan
"Doesn't look like a first, but I guess it is..."  Diplomatic dissing
#neverforget
That sound you hear are all of those Pats fans jumping on the Bucs bandwagon now that their team didn’t make the playoffs.
1:05 You know something's gone wrong when your QB is your lead blocker. lol
When Falcon start with 30-0 with other teams, Yeah!!! we are good. When Falcon start with 30-0, against TB12, Damn... we fvcked up, should never lead.
The Bucs are the only team that can compete with KC.  Period.  No disrespect to Aaron Roger's but hes not Tom Brady or Pat Mahomes.  So let's all pray to the sun god Ra that that ends up being the SB match up in this 2020 scab/strike/covid half assed pretend season
Are we gonna talk about how the refs gave  the bucks that first down even after reviewing it when it clearly wansnt, just to make sure Brady made it to the post season?
Buccaneers is my favorite team
LETTSSSS GOOOOOOO
The Falcons just can't hold on to a lead for nothing!
The buccaneers were lucky to win this game they can't afford to be facing these massive deficits in games and expect to win thats a recipe for disaster especially against the good teams luckly the falcons was not one of them why is tom brady been asked to throw down the field everytime he dropsback they need a patriot style offense short unpredictable passes to the endzone at his age he is not going to last because of what they are asking him to do
A few of these Buccaneer offensive linemen are wild, man. Committed to getting those extra rushing yards by smashing into the pile. Love to see it.
Falcons. Suck.
How many times the falcons are gonna choke againts tom brady
So they choked to Brady twice!!!
Tanking at its best
@Urinatingtree lolcow of the week
Hey falcons fans super bowl 51
Not in the playoffs yet, but the Bucs got a winning season!
*The Falcons are the only team in the NFL that requires all personnel from the team owner to the stadium ushers to know the Heimlich maneuver.*
The glossy firewall clinicopathologically question because spaghetti postsynaptically flap during a arrogant harbor. abashed, alike crow
This game is the ultimate proof that the Bucs struggles are almost entirely bad coaching.
No mask Tom
Girl: how do I know ur loyal Me: I'm a falcons fan
Wow agin Atlanta? Smh
Thank you Tampa Bay for finally starting to play. I was scared my falcons might win and mess up our draft picks. All these people talking about the Falcons choked, of course, that's what we wanted to do. WE ARE TANKING. This is the right way to tank, still look decent but lose. WE AIN'T THE JETS!
Brady showed TF out in the second half.
Falcons be having PTSD of that super bowl they lost to brady 😭😭
I see the Falcons are still in 28-3 mode.
The fun starts at 5:07.
This game felt familiar #patsvfalcons
More RIGGED than the election
Bucs first half defense is horrible. They couldn't cover a mattress yet alone receivers. And offensive line is a bunch of bull fighters. Playing that ole protection.
AB back touchdowning!
Mike Evans felt that 😂😂 5:43
UrinatingTree is going to have fun with this LOL go Bucs
I stopped watching at half time since Falcons were cruising. Did I miss anything?
Falcons will bever be Ravens they dont have the guts💪
If only the Bucs can have a good 1st half, they can be an unstoppable team.
Ouch, poor Matt
Maury: When it comes to 35 month old baby Ryan, Mr. Brady, You Are The Father!
yay we didn’t do all of this for 8-8
I didn't know Falcons were into bdsm... Nothing wrong with a little choke kink
love to see antonio brown come back in such a fashion after he almost black listed himself from the nfl lol. used to watch videos of him training daily even tho no team would take him just to stay sharp.
AB is the 1 receiver
What do you suppose tom brady says to Matt Ryan at rhe end of games. I can't think of anything that wouldn't be condescending or patronizing.
Atlanta adds another chapter to their textbook for how to lose with a double digit lead.
Falcons :"I feel comfortable we're up 17"  Brady: "That's cute. Right where we want em boys."
Still looking for comments about that last call.... Y'all keep me laughing though ☠️
Another 4th quarter come from behind victory from the B.O.A.T. , Mister Clutch, Tom Brady.  What a competitor , forever fierce  even though they trailed by a whopping 17 points at halftime.  This victory guarantees the bucs a rare winning season. Brady is the primary reason, of course. They are almost certainly also headed for their first playoffs in 12 whopping years. Awesome.
Bruh buc def SUCK!!!
Brady and brown Connection 💪💪💪 love it 100%
Tom Brady’s career is godly
Anyone surprised by the outcome?
who else was happy shady mcoy was in the highlight
Surprised Brady only let them Go Up 17 Points
Super Bowl all over again!!! Pathetic!!!
Choke artists = Atlanta Falcons
Thank you Falcons. We'll take another one of rhose in 2 weeks.
I got to add that train sound effect to my 2K Arena music.
From 0 nd 17 dam braddy
I’m so happy for AB man. I knew it took the right organization to get him to STFU and just play!
Matt Ryan was on fire for the Falcons, but Tom Brady turned in another 4th quarter comeback performance, and the Buccaneers rallied for the win.
Falcons blew both a 17-0 and 24-7 lead to Tampa Bay in route to a 31-27 loss.
Tom:  "Can we play them every week?"
Tell me again how our boy can't throw deep! Woot @tombrady
UTree be like: The Falcons did it agai- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
It's games like this that makes me excited to see these otherwise lack luster debate shows come Monday morning.
Wow.  Brady is something else
Falcons " we will choke till we cant choke no mo '  "
he threw it on the 1 yard line?? should have handed it to beast mode!!!
Falcons are trying to lose more than the Jets 🤣🤣
At least it ain't the Superbowl
Unbelievable comeback from the Buccaneers. Game of two halves.
Falcons have the worst uniforms in the league.
Cornerbacks of Tamba Bay needs some upgrading they always choke.
You can feel all that emotion when Antonio Brown screamed.
9-5 bby!!!! Lmao Arians is leading us in da right direction!!!! Lmfao
Damn, Brady has had more sacks than a Penn State locker room
I am happy for AB, i hope he can turn around his actions off the field and be great again 🔥🔥🔥
Falcons: I feel like choking another game.
Matt Ryan, the Jim Kelly of this generation
"It's Tom Brady though..." - Taylor Gabriel (2017)
the refs are actually blind and I think there is something wrong with them. Just look at 12:55. Man these refs really do be siding with tom brady.
first half 0-17 2nd half 31-27   falcons fans:We saw that choke coming a mile away.
here comes brady starting to cook for the playoffs watch out teams
that was not even close to a first down 😂😂😂. ridiculous, the ref was even pushing the stick forward to reach the tip of the ball. classic refs helping out tom #cheater
Matt Ryan is gonna wince every time he hears Brady's name for the rest of his life..he's gonna have PBSD Post Brady Stress Disorder..LOL
Who really thought the Falcons were gonna win anyway?
I got hype for AB!!!!!!
For a second, I was scared that TB would lose. But of course, the Falcons did what the Falcons have grown accustomed to: choking away good-sized leads. Also, congrats to TB for coming back and picking up win number 9. Their final 2 games are favorable with games against Detroit and a rematch with ATL. The Bucs should make the playoffs unless something unforeseen happens in their final 2 games.
28-3 + 24-7 = 52-10. The mathematics of choking.
2017 Tom Brady: comes back 28-3 in the Super Bowl vs the Falcons  2020 Tom Brady: wanna see me do it again?
ab burnt em upppp
bucs need to play collectively as a team on both ends of the ball or they will be gone fast in the playoffs.
Know it’s a new playbook for Brady and 2020 season was abnormal, but if they could only beat the saints 😩
What a great game cant wait to see what happens when they play again in 2 weeks
Everybody gangsta against TB until the 2nd half
Just waiting patiently til Urinating Tree reviews this game
As a Bucs fan they are hard to watch. That 1st half made me turn the channel. Then all of a sudden i check my phone and they're winning. All i know is that shits not going to work against the good teams. They need to figure out how to play a full game.
The Falcons lost the only way the could.
Stop. The falcons have gone through enough, so don't comment about how they choked yet ANOTHER game.
*THE GOAT IS BACK*
BRADY DOES IT AGAIN
Damn, Atlanta got robbed on that measure...
Falcons with a pretty comfortable lead at first half Brady at second half: hold my beer.
antonio brown is not playing 🎴🎴
Words: Words Words Words Words Words...    Comment: Comment Comment!
Does my heart good to see AB back in the end zone where he belongs 🤙🏾
Good to see AB putting in that work
That block from brady was just great
Falcons: 17 point lead Brady: How many times must I teach you?
The Falcs about to petition to play 2 quarters
boy winfield jr just like his pops shutdown
The Falcons are really good for a 4-10 team
Bro the Buccaneers secondary is absolutely PATHETIC smh.
U CAN TELL ANTONIO WAS RELIEVED
congrats AB!!!
As a diehard Falcons fan, I don't care. I want us to lose all our remaining games. We must obtain TLaw.
I knew brady would do it again he is a goat for a reason
Brady and deficits to atl
What a comeback by the buccaneers 🏴‍☠️
I swear Brady turns into Master Chief every time he’s down versus a league MVP QB....can smell the blood
Atlanta is the worst best team
Patriots is my team but I'll forever be a Brady fan. Good job TB12!! We sure as hell miss you up here in New England!😢
Giant holes in bucs defense... again
Miss Pat where you at.
Fun fact,  the Falcons suck ..
I can’t even lie the falcons disgust me .
That go-ahead TD to AB had me so hype
Tom Brady Super Bowl: Wanna see me come back against the falcons Tom Brady: Wanna see me do it again
*BRADY AGAIN AGAINST RYAN* *TB12 IS THE REAL GOAT* 👌
at least we can get WILSON OR FIELDS
Once again Chokelanta Failcons lead big in the game and then choke again! How many times Matt Ryan is your team continuing to keep losing to Tom Brady?!
LETS GO BUCS
Is that another 4th quarter comeback by Brady against the Falcons? Lol, i think it is. 28-3 just won't go away. Poor Falcons fans
undisputed: what letter grade do you give brady for his performance yesterday  shannon sharpe: i gave him a b
In this game and the superbowl First half:Falcons 38, Brady 3 Second half: Falcons 17, Brady 65
Koo needs to be in the pro bowl. Bro has been most accurate kicker in NFC this year
The Falcons seem to just hate winning..
Urinating tree finna have a field day with this
I think its safe to say that Tom Brady has single handedly ended Matt Ryan's career.
Soon the Atlanta Falcons bout to be called the Atlanta Brady’s.
down 17 at half, offense, defense, special teams, and coaching all stepped up in the 2nd half to contribute to a huge team win.  let's do it for a full 60 minutes going forward.
1:11  damn we not gon talk about that block from brady?
that was a bullshit 1st down at the end of the game but i don’t like either team so🤷🏽‍♂️
Matt Ryan has one more try or he has to give Tom Brady his Soul.
Falcons the Toronto Raptors of the NFL if you catch my drift...they both have the Greatest Of All time as their owners
They won’t go far in the playoffs this year; but next year, if the country doesn’t burn down  , the Bucs will be sailing full speed ahead!
Brady is on target
"Look mommy I'm a Falcon!" *choking noises*  Can't wait for UrinatingTree
The Bucs cheated for the first down and for the win after that
Omg omg the falcons have done it again they have once again choked a lead . It’s in their DNA
UrinatingTree, it’s time to strike.
I swear Matt Ryan must have PTSD whenever he plays Tom Brady
28-3 still lives on🥴🥴🤣🤣 can y’all just sell that GayTL team already
Hey uh you do realize urinating tree will put you for the low cow of the week if u choke again
Atlanta keep blowing leads whatba joke lol.They outplayed buccs for so long smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
Falcons: *goes up 0-17* Brady: and i took that personally...
Brady decided to rub some massive salt in that superbowl wound.
DO YOU  REALLY THINK ATL IS LOSING FOR REAL. THIS ENTERTAINMENT YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR EYES
Falcons: Leading 17-0  Tom Brady: Laughs in 28-3
Atlanta field look long wide as sh^&
HELL YEAH MY BUCS CAME BACK LOL... THIS GAME REMIND ME OF THE SUPERBOWL WHEN TOM CAME BACK AND WON IN OVERTIME BEATIN FALCONS HAHA
Jamel Dean was the MVP today for the bucs. Great team Win!
Experts: “Bucs needs to run the ball more” Brady: *throws for almost 400 yards*
Antonio brown finally caught a touchdown! 😂 🔥
13:00 Obviously not a first down
If the NFL is only played on first half Falcons would have been back to back Superbowl Champions by now.
Nothing new the just the falcons choking like always
Another lead blown by the falcons wow😂
Nice come back win let go buc's.
that game was exactly like 28-3
brady is pretty good at getting sacked and not fumbling lol
the GOAT does it AGAIN
He does it again..! brady gets carries by the refs for another W! He needed refs.... To beat Atlanta. Thats impressive. And you can call me salty and hater, but you know that I am right, because at the end, that ball did not break the first down line. But hey, if brady needs that kind of help to win... : )
News Alert! Tom Brady is the new owner of Atlanta Falcons!
5:07 for the magic
This game makes me question the NFLs integrity.  It was literally almost the same score as the super bowl.
1.10 how about brady 's blocking effort
Bucs Secondary guesses too much, our D line and O line are inconsistent. Was pretty happy with our offensive play calling today,  Glad we're playing to Brady's strength of spreading the ball instead of continuously forcing the ball down the field. Play to Brady strength no turnovers. Crazy how that works
I'm no longer  a falcon fan
You know Brady played great and I’m a huge fan but I wish he wouldn’t wait until the 2nd half to start turning it on. That’s why they can’t beat good teams
Skip finna be on his knees tomorrow because Bucs won and Patriots lost😂😂  Skip: “You see that throw to AB” Also Skip: “Bill Belichick got exposed”
Bruh
Falcons: Up 17-0 and 24-7 Brady: "Lol where have I seen this before"
That wasn’t a first
The fact that The Falcons blew another lead to Tom Brady of all people. The National Sports Media gonna have a field day with this one.  What is that the 4th blown lead this season alone?
Brady once again reminding ATL who their *REAL* owner is. LMFAO imagine owning this team in OT to win a historic SB, THEN winning your SIXTH SB in THEIR STADIUM! THEN, MOVING TO THEIR DIVISION TO OWN THEM TWICE ANNUALLY! LMFAO! 😂😂😂😂
Reminds me of the Super Bowl.
Brady vs Ryan again....
Falcons: scored 17 points Brady: and i took that personally
Atlanta blew a 17-0 lead
360th comment rise up
Tom Brady to Falcons: I own u
I think the days of Julio JOnes are numbered
Really Falcons
Falcons: have a big lead.  Whole falcons team: aight ima head out
aaaaaaahaaa chokemasters🤣🤣🤣🤣
When you let your little brother have the controller for the first half:
Somewhere in Atlanta,Arthur Blank is drunk off top shelf liquor and mumbling the following: “Got damn HEADS are going to ROLL this off season!!!”
Falcons: Hey Tom you want us to give you another comeback win you got it sir
Tom brady: bruce when do you want us to start trying  Bruce Arians: i dont know man, just start whenever you want  i also just realized the buccaneers are always good later in there games.
The entire Choke-Wars movie series   1. The choking menace 2. Attack of the Cowboys 3. The revenge of the Bears 4. A new Lead 5. The Gurly strikes back 6. The return of the Chargers 7. The Bucs awakens 8. The last Points 9. Rise of Brady
_Falcons:_ 17-0 at the half *It was at that moment the Falcons knew they F'kd up*
What does Christmas and the Falcons choking have in common?  It's simply tradition.
Dang Brady did it again to the Falcons!
Them dam Falcons do this to me every time and every time I fall for it.  Get my hopes up that maybe, just maybe we can pull one out. Nah! We got you to watch, got you to hope......and then we dash your brains on the pavement......again.  My own fault for being an optimist......or a sucker, take your pick.
im so over the bucs doing this to me every game lol
Old man needs a half to warm up, but he's still the GOAT
falcons are CURSED man, gotta DISBAND the franchise
As a Bucs fan, when I saw Atlanta up 17-0 at half time, I was like THANK GOODNESS 😂
Sean Murphy-Bunting #23 absolutely sucks. They need to cut his sorry ass. ALWAYS 2 feet out of position and 2 feet behind.
not surprised falcons blow another lead 😂
28-3
THAT CHOKE THOOOO
Typical Falcons
Falcons out there choking harder and more often than mia khalifa
3 guaranteed things in life  • Taxes • Death • The Falcons blowing leads against Tom Brady
Imagine how good the Falcons would be if they never blew leads.
Matt Ryan gonna have PTSD every time he hears Brady’s name
Falcons: 17 point lead 👉🏽 Tom Brady Not (OVERRRR) (MYYY) #DECEASED# (BODY)  #B%$@%#
I love the falcons but they blow leads way to much!😂
Tom brady just ruining the falcons franchise again
17-0  And I still knew bucs would win Yup that’s the Falcons
Honestly I’m not suprised anymore it’s just sad the Falcons just can’t hold a damn lead
Bucs: They had us in the 1st half not gonna lie.  ahahaha
lmao poor falcons having flashbacks
Don’t ever disrespect the GOAT again 🐐
Tom Brady is the REAL owner of the Atlanta Falcons 😈
I don't think they will gel offensively until next year.  Also bucs pass coverage is killing me.
Anlanta flacons blow another lead
My bucs❤❤❤ I love u, best comeback of the year and of our franchise. It was a must win❤
Falcons: Alright, we’ve learned from the previous games, no choking this time Bucs: 😎😎
Not a Falcons fan but not a first down.
There are only 3 things guaranteed in life. 1.Death 2.Taxes 3. The Falcons blowing a big lead to Tom Brady
They can’t beat Brady lol
took so long to upload
🎅
Falcons, we blew a 28-3 lead against the Goat in 2017...  Falcons, we took it a step further in 2020 with a 17-0 lead 😈
Tampa team is just heating up!!!!
When tom brady retires he is gonna be the owner of the falcons🤣🤣🤣
Tom Brady de novo de virada pra sima dos falcons , ele er o melhor
Should've lost against LV 2 weeks ago. Better draft spot and no false hopes. Season has already been over after week 8.
I was worried AB wouldn’t get a TD with the Bucs, but he finally got one
Tom Brady at 43: Throws for almost 400 yards in the second half   Patriots: lose to Dolphins
Brady is 43 and just threw for 390 yards😳
It’s that 28-3 feeling all over again , and again the falcons could not finish the job , Tom Brady absolutely is just the Atlanta Falcons’ villain
Falcons fans: 17 points lead? Let's go!  Also Falcons fans: why do i hear boss music
Tbh no one surprised that the falcons choked
Chiefs and Bucs are the best 2nd half teams in the NFL. But the Chiefs show up in the first half and the whole game, which seperates themselves from others. Also, the Chiefs have a GOD at QB.
Choke Bowl #????
The Falcons are now ironically 28-34 since there super bowl LI loss.
Tom Brady: in addition to being the GOAT he is also proud owner of the Falcons.
They just keep Falcon around, don't they?
Anyone see the ref move the ball?
Wow this is unbelievable falcons choke again!! Tom brady 2-0 coming back from behind against the falcons when down big
“There are no mistakes” Master oogway
atlanta chokers
brady loves being down against the falcons lmao
Falcons: 24-7 easy dubs Brady: did u forget who you’re playing?
Hi
0 doubt in my mind that the falcons would lose after seeing the 3rd qrtr
This is totally unrelated, but sometimes you gotta like your own comment to get it rolling right?
Chalk up another comeback for the 🐐
Tom Brady after the game to Matt Ryan:"28-3"
Remember when all the Brady and Bucs haters said they wouldn't win more than 8 games? I sure do
Glad to see AB getting that touchdown. Hopefully this comeback performance can get the Bucs going fr
Falcon just need to clean house at this point
Ooops I did it again
First take tomorrow be like: "Are the Buccaneers serious superbowl contenders?"
Tom Brady could be down 34-0 to the falcons and he would still win
Tom Brady is officially the owner of the falcons
well the falcons "They are who we thought they were" =the falcons when it comes to choking
Slow Start baby!!!!!!
Don't let this distract you from the fact the Falcons choked again.
Falcons PTSD Intensifies
Never doubt the GOAT! How long do you guys think he’ll keep playing? I say this year and 3 more
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We are the laughing stock of the NFL now & it's just painful to watch
Falcons choked
Go Bucs !!🏴‍☠️
Falcons choked
Falcons lead at half 17-0 Falcons: Oh don’t worry we will do what we do best
Brady owns Atlanta.
This video should be no longer than 5 minutes. It's called highlights not gamelites.
Imma spam falcons choked
Congratulations to Atlanta’s head coach Rahim Morris for winning the head-coaching position of 2021!!!!
28-3 17-0  Wonder what it will be in two weeks...
GO BUCS 🏴‍☠️💯
even as a Bucs fan that call at the end for a 1st down was bullshit.
Alright.. be honest... We all saw this coming 🤣💀
Sus falcons
Falcons r gay for liking to choke
Falcons winning 17-0 Me: super bowl Ll flashbacks
Falcons up 17-0: We aren't blowing this lead Bucs: oh yeah? *scores first TD after halftime* Falcons: *respond and go up 24-7:* See? We won't let you!  Bucs: You're only delaying the inevitable.
Brady doing what he always has done!! He made Belechick!!!
Brady: 17-0 against the Falcons? 🙂👍
Falcons suck
Bru falcons really chocked
NFL stop deleting my comments
Falcons have a lead  Matt Ryan Vietnam flashbacks.
The never-failing Champions of Choke.
GO BUCCANEERS!
I feel bad for the Falcons  -Choked a 17 pt lead in the NFC championship  -Choked a 25 pt lead in the superbowl  -Choked a 20 pt lead against the cowboys  -Choked another 17 pt lead against the bears  -almost choked a 28 pt lead against the broncos  -then choke ANOTHER 17 pt lead against the Bucy
routine for the falcons
Falcons: Scores 17 points. Tom Brady: So You Have Chosen Death
Ryan sees Brady when he closes his eyes
I promise you if JW was the QB the refs would’ve not given them that first down 💀
Tom Brady: Coach they up 17-0! Bruce: Yea Brady: Hold my beer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just a walk in the park for Atlanta
At this point the Falcons are the absolute masters of the art of choking.
As soon as the Falcons jumped out to a sizeable lead, I knew there was no way the Bucs would lose...
CHOKE ALERT
At this point, the Falcons should just trademark choking
Hood your breath, the army of “OMG Brady leads another comeback against the Falcons and the Falcons choke again” comments are marching toward us. Stand your ground, it’s shaking!
I'm a Bucs fan. The way we play in the first half is very frustrating!! It was a good come back in the 2nd half. But if we keep playing this way. We are going 1 and done in the playoffs.  We are definitely underperforming at times with this offense. Byron Leftwich sucks as a play caller!  We have the talent to compete with any team, but we are to inconsistent right now.
They cheated falcons not calling penilities and first down
All I’m going to say as a falcons fan is that I knew this was happening at the end of the first half
but he’s washed tho
Just when 28 to 3 jokes started to stop, this dude Tom Brady decided to join the Bucs a team in our division to torture us twice a year, and comeback on us down 17 twice!! Can't wait for next time! 😡😡 Falcons fans most definitely.
Falcons: 17-0 TB12: Now I have no choice...SORRY...
Every falcons fan that is used to this at this point like this comment.    (I said that because I know there is a lot)
Falcons: We blow leads Also Falcons: wanna see me do it again Also Falcons: wanna see me do it once more Honestly Falcons fans why do you guys even bother watching them I feel like this is fate atp
Tampa cheated the Falcons
Somebody need to check those refs bank account ,cuz that was not a 1st down to end the game 13:16
CLASSIC FALCONS
Death, Taxes and the Falcons choking.
Falcons in super bowl 51: Choke a 28-3 lead to Brady Falcons today after going up 17-0: Wanna see me do it again?
Sack Ryan and the Atlanta Failcons strike again.
As a Falcons Fan, I swear we could be up 49-0 against the freaking jets with 1 sec left and still find a way to loose the damn game....
We need to give Brady a paternity test. He might be Atlanta's father.
Super bowl 51: The sequel
God official hates the Falcons
Can’t wait for urinatingtree response
1:10 hey c'mon, nobodys gonna talk about Brady's blocking effort? Lol
Welp that’s just the falcons being the falcons by choking another lead
Brady is to Atlanta is to what Lebron is to Toronto
THAT CALL WAS SO BULLSHIT. Brady really struggling against the falcons .
Im just happy the falcons gave them a good game
Ryan needs to request a trade. The Falcons are cursed and you can’t tell me otherwise.
Wow... Just wow ..
Bucs have got to play better from the start. They have moments where they look like the best offense in the league but they need to start like that in the playoffs
Kevin Burkhardt
Falcons fans are going to have PTSD about Brady for the rest of their lives
AB the 🐐
These numbers will haunt the Falcons. 28-3 26-7 26-10 24-7
Ahhhhhhhhhhh falcons blowing a another lead against tom brady
Do we even have to say it The falcons are good at what they do
Glad that Antonio brown got a touchdown today
Letssss go Bucs weee goin to the playoffs
Atlanta "What do you mean there's a 2nd half" Falcons
And Adam rank said this was going to be matt ryans revenge on tom brady
My grandma started hitting the back of the TV like she was trying to get it to breathe when I asked why she said look its choking , Atlanta Falcons for ya
Falcons and choking are like 5&6
Hey Falcons fans sweet dreams😈
The Falcons blowing a huge halftime lead to Tom Brady......hmm....where have I seen that before?
I’m still a Pats fan through and through, but it is nice to see Brady see happiness elsewhere. Especially after years of pay cuts and not complaining. #GoPats
This isnt even surprising anymore, sort of sad now. They need to redo this whole roster, culture, or something.
when you see another school during the field trip https://youtu.be/N5L2HaY20GM
All I can say is yes 😊😊, like if you agree 👇
Brady saying aaaaaay remember super bowl 51?
The refs are clearly rigging the game for Brady, it was absolutely not a first down at the end. And the buccs didn't even need it, the falcons were gonna choke regardless
Brady Haters are seething with anger right now. And I couldn't be happier :)
And her come the 2017 Super Bowl comments 😂
Sub
Great to see AB catch his first TD as a Buccaneer
So Brady really did the falcons like that again
I get that the bucs might of won but bs ass call
Matt ryan: FLASHBACKS
Falcons blew a 28-3 lead
"But they got Tom Brady tho"
well well well, another CHOKEFEST
Matt Ryan: This time we will be brave.   Bucs: No
So pats 6-8 and bucs 9-5 *nuff said*
Can’t use this profile pic anymore
The falcons are just choking for views now😅🤣
Falcons: Our Revenge for the Super bow- Tom Brady: Lemme stop you there.
Atlanta Falcons: Tom Brady : I am your father 😤😤😤
That was not a first down idc what anybody say😂
At this point, just count every time the falcons have the lead in the 4th quarter a loss, this team is a mess.
Falcons have to be lolcow of the week this week.
As if blowing another lead wasn't bad enough for Atlanta it had to be against Brady 😂
The draft picks are going to be good
Nice win for Tampa Bay, but they have to eliminate these bad habits of coming out lethargic in the first half and turning it on in the 2nd half of games
Matt Ryan had ptsd that game
Falcons were used to see you choke nothing new
Tom Brady the goat fr
Dan Quinn wasn't the problem💯💯
😵😵😵 that’s all I have to say
Falcons: “We’re gonna choke and we’re gonna choke hard.”
Tom Brady: Down 17-0 to the Falcons  Also Tom Brady: Rubbing his hands like Birdman
When Tom Brady retires, he's going to be the Owner of the Atlanta Falcons 🤣🤣🤣
Falcons choking is as American as baseball and apple pie.
😂😂😂 ATL you just couldn't help yourselves could you 🤔?
Falcons really said “wanna see me choke to Brady? Wanna see me do it again?”
https://youtu.be/OIfXdtml2gU
LMFAOOOO FALCONS DID IT AGAIN LOL
Can we all agree that Calvin Ridley has been a top 5 receiver this season? 🤷🏽‍♂️
Falcons and choking name a better duo cant.
Falcons are gay becuase they like choking
Atlanta hates tom brady
Tom brady comes to Atlanta     Falcon's: Why do I hear boss music.
I hope 1% that reads this will follow their dreams an never give up. My dream is to become a successful Youtuber.
Brady out here at 43 coming back from 17-0, throwing for almost 400 yards. 🐐🐐🐐
Can we talk about how Brady threw 307 yards in the second half? I don’t care if it was against a team of chokers, that’s impressive.
Falcons choked once again
Matt Ryan: intense flashbacks
Fun Fact: Brady remains unbeaten in his career against the Falcons!
Ryan and the Falcons are having flashbacks
I didn’t know Dan Quinn was still the coach.
Tom Brady: You really thought a 17 point lead would be enough after last time?
The falcons have a small air tube
NFL give me a shoutout
Most people think giving up leads has been a problem for the Falcons only this year. Fact is this started back in 2012 in the divisional round vs Seattle. Almost lost. The next week, NFC championship vs the 9ers gave up another lead and lost. It’s been increasingly worse every season. They never had a solid enough defense to win. Matt is a future HOF.
Brady: No lead is safe from me. Ryan: No lead is safe FOR me.  C’mon Matt stop taking stupid sacks when the game is on the line. You’ve done this before. Just sayin’.
Falcons: We have a 17 point lead. Also Falcons: We’ll take care of that.
Ahhh the falcons doing what they do best
That game sums up Tampa's entire season. Slow start, sloppy & fall down 10+. Eventually find there game & dominate. Consistently will decide there playoff run.
Brady is still the 🐐
Falcons choked again 😂
28-3
You mean to tell me the Falcons blew a lead? 😱 No way!
Falcons love choking big leads, especially to Brady.
TOM BRADY AND TB BUCS WINNER: WEEK 15
first
Falcons: 17-0 in the half, those days of choking leads are over.  Bucs: You sure about that?
Yo first
Ending the game on brady special, first down when the ball did not reach the line. Nice.
E
Bad
32 TDS!!!!!
Who would of guessed they choked
This looks so familiar!
Brady did it again!
