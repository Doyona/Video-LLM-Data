NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Don't deny it. You wanted the chocobanana. If not chocobanana, then what else would you CHOOSE from our selection of six delicious dishes? ALSO following on from last week's video complaining about 480p video, we've upped the ante this week by releasing this video in 5K! (Whatever that is).
Food
Many years late to this one! But chocolate banana is ... Just childhood memories ❤  1.make a fire in the woods 2. Wrap a banana in aluminium foil 3. Toss into fire 4. Take it out of fire 5. Cut a legthwise incission though foil and peel 6. Stuff with as much chocolate your parents allow you to 7. Profit!
Buffet of optimism.
Its cheap in Japan..
When Ryatoro says “so you give lower score than banana on a stick” 😂🤣
I've watched all the food videos on this channel.
4:03 It's obviously shrimp btw
£10 for 2000 yen atm, so prob shouldn't be shouting about this beautiful market to tourists...   Then I saw how far away from tokyo this is 💀💀
I think "gill" is a mistranslation. That's a Tuna collar, and it's great.
Tbh eating a chocolate banana sounds good
I remember seeing this video on Facebook a year or 2 ago ,it helped encourage me to come find the channel 👍
Justice for choco banana
you sure that was gill? was it not collar?
The yen has dropped. Only $12.55. Not even a tenner in pounds
It kind of sucks, that 2k yen was 20 dollars, and now its about 12
can elon musk please order take out
Street food equals slave food.
Zinc, copper, nylon 😂
i'm a little sad. because even 5 years earlier we used to have these in my country. but people found faster food in sit down restaurants and felt "what's another 50 yen(equivalent)". unfortunately, that was enough to drive these street businesses to extinction. however, the sit down ones increased prices every 2 years or so. so now cheaper good food is hard to find.
At 4:39 you can heard Uncle Roger yell "FUIYOH" in the background🤣
ok, it's obvious ryotaro played super mario as a kid. he was note for note perfect on that theme song.
That a thrilling way to end
This looks like a great place to eat in your day off.
Death Banana!
After watching all your videos 2-3 times I can say that this is easly my favourite one Chris!
You guys are hilarious! Thanks for sharing your Japanese morning Market trip. The food looked really good.
Love this video and the first video was when Ryo said “he’s going to get some SHIT” lol
Hey, we do not know each other but I would like to tell u that despite all the bad that you have done in your life, GOD still loves you and wants you to be with him (GOD), all yoi must do is to trust in Jesus like how he would trust in parachute when jumping out of a plane and you must be willing to turn from your wrong doings and do what is good😊😊😊 1:44
9:35 he actually said umami flavor without the american accent holy shit
8:22 We all know the real reason why Chris choose this noodle shop.
Omg its so cheap while being perfect quality
Looks great but your lucky, my misses (who is japanese) took me to Yufuin to a nice hot spring bath hotel and we had a nice 9 course dinner dish included. The only trouble was it included a course or fish spunk. locally called Milt. I had to get a pregnancy test when I returned to England
ARUN ICE CREAMS
I am still Ryotaro's fan!! ❤ I want him to have a cooking channel!
Are public market BBQs common in Japan? I am traveling this year and would love to try this
Ryotaro singing Mario
Those gambas look amazingly good
I challenge you two to do a purely vegan food day out in Japan. 🤣🤣🤣 I bet Chris would cry
I heard Uncle Roger in the background at 4:45ish
yes, chocolate banana in raging neon pink...very
ryotaro ❤️
Wait Chris I thought you don’t cook so are you not worst
Looks good
Your up at 7
Everything is renewed except the fish, still extinct
SHRIMP over chicken all day
my fav video ngl
Ryotaro and natsuki's English is so good. Makes me want to learn a second language
You make me smile……….(1st out of the barriers for the Breakfast Race = chocobanana pink style……)😎😎😎💞💞💞😂😂😂
I'm with you on the chocobanana. I would have annihilated that stand. There would have been more phallic-shaped objects entering my mouth than Kaitlyn Jenner in a porta-potty at a football game.
Chris is sucha a cutie pie!
Ryotaro covering SMB was great. +1000
Umami to me taste’s like a warm blanket and a hug from my parents when I was young.
Who can give me official data on the radioactive level of the local seafood around Sendai? Much Thanks~!
Wow, that was a ton of food for $20. I especially love that the favorite dish ended up being gyudon which you could have gotten at Yoshinoya.   "PEASANT!" 🤣
0:19 is it only me or does he look like ryo from girugamesh lool
and now 2000 yen is 14 USD... sad.
Great videos! Im watching them after work to relax, keep it up please :)
In a place like that market, I would only look for fresh sea food, not even fish, unless I could get tons of sushi. But praws, sea cucumber and scallops would be my go to. Also squid and octopus.
I'd have totally gotten one of those bananas too, Chris!! (And I bet 9 was the right # for it!) haha
I like the content but I don't care for the dirty language
I want a chocolate banana 🍌🍡🍫🍩
Hidden doge.
i wish i can find healthy food as well with nylon in it.
you got ripped off on your portion of chicken !
I love chocobanana it’s like a banana covered with chocolate and vanilla and strawberry frosting with sprinkles good thinking Chris  I am moving to Japan when I am older and super excited to meet you guys soon
I love how his Japanese friends have British-affected accents when they speak English. Japanese-American accents just sound like plain Japanese accents to me.
That’s tuna collar, not gills. Gills are not really edible. Collar (as in hamachi Kama) is absolutely delicious
This video don't make justice to Asakusa variety of service and interesting products. Breakfast that every hotel have, a bath that is not common in asakusa (just that hotel offer it), don't  show the special candies they sell, don't show jinrikisha, 500¥ yakisoba and ice with syrup...well. I am really a Fan of this channel and always watch it with my wife, but this one is really low quality compared to all the content. Greetings from asakusa!
Im super excited to watch all of this
He really started the day with chocolate banana 😂😂
Ryotaro: looks for delicious wholesome food  Chris: chocolate banana on a stick and fried chicken
Beef Bowl yum
As we speak the exchange rate of Japanese yen is going down.  Nice time to visit Japan! 😄👍🌟 Not nice to go out of sea trip for Japanese people like me though.😢 LOL
Fried chicken tops shrimp any day of the week!
"Umami........ tastes like addiction" 🤣
YOU WENT INTO A JAPANESE MORNING MARKET AND HAD A CHOCOLATE BANANA??
I'm starving now omg that all looked amazing. Glad you enjoyed your chocolate banana 😋
Not enough Gyoza footage. It looked really good and simple
> Umami > Discovered over a century ago ... umami was discovered thousands of years ago. A century ago is when westerners finally admitted it is real
This is yuzuru’s home town I can’t believe it. ☺️
I've never heard it pronounced Kari ahh gay before... is that how it's pronounced in that area?
I'd call umami something like "hearty" and good comfort flavors
i know i'm pathetic. but i'm simping with this woman 08:00
Ohhh those dumblings and kimchi 😩
"Get your vitamin B... 12, zinc, copper...  *nylon*"
Ryotaro is the true Mr. Worldwide, pitbull who? I live in the U.S. and "given the right judge" is definitely a blessing out here. I always thought umami was simply a meaty taste, but he's definitely given me a more in depth understanding on the topic. Keep up the great work! Can't wait to see more from you guys, and of course the legendary Natsuki 👍🍻
beef bowls for the win i love them
I feel like at least where I live "umami" has more or less entered english as a loan word with the exact meaning it has in japanese
For 2000¥ you get about 6 whole chicken in germany. Frying not included.
I live in California and in the 60's at the beach you could buy one of my favorites ... a real chocolate covered frozen banana with chopped roasted peanuts. The best!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🤣🤣🤣👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😋😋😋
no cares what food from whatever country is better just enjoy the damn video
4:41 FUIYOOO
Why is chocolate pink?
quite
I love ryotaro. He should be the host of this channel instead of chris. Ryotaro in Japan.
8:44 CUTE DOGE
The Tuna Ribs and that Gyudon actually looked amazing. Not joking here. If I got that in a high class restaurant I would say: "And that's the difference of a high class restaurant." And yet it was rather cheap. Is this market a Sendai thing or do you find those markets around all big cities in Japan?
It's reassuring to me to see the variety of chopstick techniques from Japanese people. I eat lots of food with them, and I always worry I'm not doing it right. I suppose, if the food gets into your face-hole it's good enough? 🤷🏻‍♀I also hold pens weird so I guess it doesn't matter.
I understand Japanese are mad with face diapers, but you Chris? Come on!
That maguro gill looked sooo gooood!
I want to see Ryotaro in your videos. I miss him.
Always went to tsukiji fish market every day in my visit, this was breakfast, lunch, or brunch for at least a week, it was awesome
had the perfect amount of time to eat my very poorly made bowl of corn beef hash haha. I envy you guys for being able to try out all the delicious food Japan has to offer, though I'd never get to experience this without your videos so thank you!
Ryotaro = underwhelming Japanese villain. ok dud😂😂
I don't blame you Chris, I'd pick a chocobanana any day😂😂
Has Ryotaro lived in the UK? Wish I knew the backstory to how you guys met your friends :)
I couldn't manage that in the morning. But I'm old. Maybe 30 years ago. Ryotaro certainly enjoyed riding Chris about the chocobanana. Which looks kind of good, really.
Umami is literally just savory, the only reason umami is said in culinary circles is because MSG, the main chemical that gives off savory flavor, was identified by a Japanese man
@mrnigelng Is that Uncle Roger yelling "Fuiyoh!" in the background at 4:40??
They all look soooo nice! Choco banana all they way 👍 xx
I want to go to Japan more than ANY other country in the world... That being said, I HATE typical Japanese food!  Hate seafood, hate soy sauce, don't care for ramen, etc...  I've always wondered what I would eat up eating if I was to ever visit the country!
With Chris's love of fried chicken he really needs to come to the Southern US. We got some excellent stuff well beyond KFC...though karage chicken does look pretty tasty.
Great video Chris! I love your interaction with Ryotaro. Ryotaro is really a great guy.
Healthier and cheaper than American street food.
I love Ryotaro's happy disposition
Ryotaro is hot
Look at Ryotaro showing off by splitting the chopsticks with his teeth whilst looking at the camera. 😏  That strawberry drink at the end looked amazing! Certainly gave me a craving.. 😫
Umami is savory and everyone in the fucking world has known about it for millennia it's not some new flavor only the Japanese have found that is such an annoying myth.
For the last 10 millennia I’ve been only eating the souls of thousands of monks, I just want some dumplings bruh
We always get chocolate banana (and other fruits) on a skewer on christmas markets around here (Austria)
what's in the intro song you started with called
Grabbing breakfast over there seems a good weekly family outing 😆
Who's on camera duty?
I had intestines in a township in South Africa! Beat that chris lol
'underwhelming Japanese villain'
watching this when you're hungry is painful
what dumpling? these are PIEROGI
Oh man there's no way I have enough nylon in my diet I'm glad I watched this
Your pal is quite fun - I like him. I liked his Super Mario act.
8:42 dog on da paraplegic
I'm in love with Japanese food, its so nutritious and sweet
0:48 "underwhelming Japanese villain" lol
1:32 He is just too funny
Be sure to try the Balut!
Too bad about the muzzles.
I am yet to eat a good strawberry.
Who goes to a fish market to eat beef and fried chicken? I would have probably bought a few of the full fishes and cooked it on the barbecue.
Chris ya really need to try more foods for the channel 🤣
There is just something about a 30-something surly British man, unironically saying chocobanana, that I found immensely humourous 😆
I burst out laughing every time I rewatch this and see the moment when Ryotaro realizes Chris rated the chocobanana higher than the karaage. That hint of a smile and chuckle, and you know he's thinking, "I'm fully about to rub this in his face."
Wow that seafood platter looked so good
Alot of chemistry between Chris and Ryotaro it's great to see and adds a nice touch. Second time watching this and I've enjoyed as much as I did the first time around and I must say I would have fallen victim to the ChocoBanana as well! Everything looks soooo delicious. Oh yeah, Have you considered doing a video with EricSurf6?
Watching this made me hungry but I have nothing adequate in the cupboards to satiate this hunger... Thanks...
Chocolate banana I do think so…..
the only breakfasty thing i saw was the sausage
Pake nasi mang, meh wareg.
Get the Umami flavour and get off your criminal wrong doings
i cant believe all those seasfood cost less than $20? i luv those tuna jaws.very flavorful even just with salt.
I don't think I've ever used it correctly, but I've connected "umami" as the "richness of the taste". Meat is meatier. Fish is fishier. Broth is brothier...
If you’re into wall mounted arcade cabinets, I build them at Umbrella Arcades.
you should start doing a mukbang stream with ryo, I know I would watch it  :)
i want a chocolate banana
Overwhelming Japanese Villian. That's a very fitting title!
1:17 CUTE PUPPIES ALERT AAAAAAAA
Rawr
Still baffles me how chop sticks are still used. How do they provide a benefit over a fork and knife?
I really wish they had some more vegan options.
Your banana wasn't chocolate.   It was pink.  So, you do not get chocolate banana credit.
Is it me or does Kimchi taste similar to Salsa...
why do British people like sweet things so much ? I have been working with them since 2013 and they are always most excited by sweet things.
クリスが日本語で喋って英語の字幕をつけてほしい
I’m watching this while really hungry why do I torture myself
Those outdoor grills are so cool! I wish the markets where I live would do something like that.
I love how clean Japanese markets are 😍😍
Umami = Savory is the term and is used by chefs around the world. ie Not Chocolate Banana
Watching this while eating my bagged salad at lunch is rather depressing XD
Better than a hotdog and a shawama for sure. Cant get anything like this in northern europe
Self-grilling  ----  that´s supercool!
How to explain umami to a british person...  Marmite lol.
Watching this right before bed time does hit differently 🥺
Street food always looking good in any country
I love how you don't really correct your friends English, or belittle them on it, you just kind of throw in a small pun here and there it's quite refreshing.
I'd go there every week for sure if I lived next to it. Great atmosphere, great scenery, great prices, great food. Damn, wish I was there!
Lol! I want to know who the 300+ people who disliked this are. Why?
Chris really is too hard on Ryotaro, i understand its probably the dynamic of their friendship, but I'd be blessed to have a friend like him in Japan
Those kimchi dumplings look good
No vitamin B12 in a banana at all. Some potassium but not as much as people think there is. You want healthful nutrients (though with some rubbish too), the shrimp and pork gyoza wins.
Petition to make Cris stop killing him self for veiws      Reply and comment the letter E to participate
Risottoro, Natsuki, Sharla and Chris's other friends are such cool people, I really can't fathom why they bother with him :P
Huh, I never would've imagined that $20 could buy you $20 worth of choco-banana and karaage, *Chris.*
1:37 Put a beat behind that, you get an absolute banger! 🔥
Typical whiteboy taste buds for Asian foods. Can’t blame him for growing up with blend , greasy , overly sweetened, & crappy western foods
5:19 Can't stop laughing. This is comedy BANANA gold.  What have i become? British mate.
Depends where you go Japan or America or anywhere. 20 bucks gets me 2 foot long subs or 20 dollars can buy me one appetizer size of my palm at a fancy restaurant lol.
Ooooohhhhh rawr
Chris can’t believe you got a chocolate banana shame on you. You had enough money for eight of them.
I'm new here, but oh the bromance of discount Batman and Robin!
Breakfast of banana's
I love these videos 👍👍👍
Sate Ayam: skewerd savoury grilled chicken drizzled in sweet peanut sauce with lime undertones.  Ryotaro-san: Chicken cutlets on a stick. With peanut sauce.
So these guys want us to believe that the Japanese use a $20 strawberry to make a $7 drink?  How is that business model working out for them???
That place is really cheap. I wanna visit it soon.
TID TIID TID TIDTIDDITIDI TIDIDIDIDIDIDIDIDID 8:37 XD
Not sure what's worse: either having fruit before the main course or dessert
I just noticed the guy at 1:18 carrying 2 chihuahua in his front pocket/bag.
8:39 Maryotaro !
Commonnnnn chocobanana was a waste!!
Best DUO ever
Ah, karaage... It's either delicious or disgusting. There is no in-between. Glad you got the latter. XD
good vid
"its called well done" absolutely mental haha
Whyyyy I'm not there 😭😭😭😭
3:22 "nylon" 😂
Ryotaro needs to make a youtube channel
Wow street food in Japan is really expensive. The rupee in india and yen have almost the same value and we spend around 500rupees for that amount of food on the street.
7:35 The problem with that is that it still has non-black bits showing. Brah. It's a sausage. It's literal animal asshole. You don't want to eat uncooked asshole. You want it charred to the point where the asshole doesn't exist.
chocolate banana + fried chicken for breakfast - heading for an early coronary?
Who is the cameraman?
I never understood the difference between "Umami" and "Savory"
as someone who loves chocolate and bananas, yeah i was into it :)
I would e useless at rating food... everything would be 10 or zero... either it's perfect or I can't eat it
$10 for the three bowls is an incredible price! In Canada, I might be able to get an appetizer and a water for $10...
Haha! Funniest food video on YouTube 😂
I would absolutely get the chocolate banana
Oh my god! Those dumplings and that fried chicken! I WANT THAT NOW!!! I'm so hungry!!
8:42 DOGE
Chris talking about chocobanana, “you get all your vitamin B12, zinc, copper, NYLON”🤣.
5:29 love how ryotaro just casually eating in the background lol
Ruytaro is one handsome man, woof!!
I’ve watched this a couple of times since its release.  Does Ryotaro call you “peasant” at the end?
That chocolate banana was poor taste dude.
Beef bowl please!
I can’t believe how much we pay for seafood in the US.
Ryotoro's comment - " Again it's called well done"  Love it.🤣🤣🤣
RIŽOTO
What’s up Broski 🦋
08:44 That's a dog
Chris & Ryotaro = the best chemistry!
I wanted to write "I do not think I would travel 30 min to get a breakfast" and then Chris is like "I am too lazy". Yup.
At first the kimchi and  dumplings my stomach  started to growl. Looks. Yummy!
Ryotaro seems like he would be the most fun tour guide ever.
Not a chocolate banana. I mean you may as well buy a banana and eat it and have a chocolate bar later. You might get a better quality of chocolate anyway. Grilling with a mad man, that is what I think Chris is feeling in this video. Well strawberry milk that was nice.
Ryotaro is like the serious father and Chris is like the son starts with dessert for breakfast, kid-dulting because he can.
definitely gotta get that sweet sweet daily dose of "nylon" 😂
I clicked on the like button before I finish watching the whole video.
Ah yes the best mario party minigame: carrying soup bowls.
8:43 looks at that dog
UNDERWHELMING JAPANESE VILLAIN!😅😅😅😅
When will Christ visit a Fried Chicken Festival in Japan?
My first thought of that shot was "They put icing on sauages!?"
You didn't eat the gills, did you? I would want to try the gyudon, never had it myself. Would never try the banana though, I hate those
Shrimp is a sea insect.
Ryotaro's English has gotten so good!
Lmao I love the little fire fan xD
20 dollar per 🍓
Love this! And side-note, I don't think I've ever seen a vid with 1M + views, and only a TINYYY handful of dislikes. Impressive, and easy to see why <3
That seafood BBQ tray looked fantastic! I'm craving for great seafood now.
I really, really want a chocobanana lol
It is said that people who corrects other people's vocabulary or grammar dies alone. Chris you've got to stop being critical 😏😏 😜😜
Chris, I would love to see how one eats in a day gluten free in Japan. Once we can travel again, Imma going straight to Japan. Just as a Coeliac, I'm nervous about how I'm going to eat.
Great video, I like your friendship
1:17 There's a dude carrying puppies like a kangaroo...😲
u are becum fatmen chriss
Waitwaitwait isn't the box triangular at 4:29 then rectangular at 4:32?? Am I missing something or was it not triangular previously???
8:40 doggo
no rice for chicken is depressing! damn i with i live there
Ryotaro should be the villan in a Japanese food anime. Like if you agree!
Ryotaro looks like a great friend to be around. He'll make anything fun.
I would try the beef bowl, and chocolate banana.
Dont want the chocobanana. Would totally vomit xD happens everytime my body gets chocolate, it just cant process it i guess. So when i look at chocolate I get a bad taste in the mouth xD
Ryataro is delicious..😉😉😊
Fuyioooooh uncle roger in the background at 4.38 wtf
Ryotaro just can't accept the fact that Chris chose the Choco banana as the Best food he's ever eaten XDD
Nylon in Banana hahahaha Chris
Fresh and cheap 😋
Here in Turkey with 20 dollars u can get kebab for ur entire family 😝🤣
Rawr
8:00 daaangggg, i understand why you stop at that shop.......
In the second ever video of Abroad in Japan (Culture Shock) he talks about sushi translated as "First Bonito Concrete Floor" and when he eats the bonito containing soup I kept thinking about that story.
Leave it to the king of convenient store fried chicken to give a critical review.
全然美味しそうでない．．Food Choice が悪い．．日本人の好みでない！げっー．．．チョコレットバナナ？ゲーっ
ココ行きたいですね！
"but the batter is not like crispy, because it marinates in lots of garlic"  said the fried chicken expert.
“This is really the worth”
Underwhelming Japanese Villain
What do you do with the trays and trash? Are the grills just first coke first serve? Where do you get the coals from?
Ryotaro overall just had better taste from the gyoza to the sea food on the literal ocean.  And the price of the tuna and set was so good I do like a bit of seasoning even on my seafood so I do wonder how that went
I would simply spend more than 2,000 yen
Drool
Bananaful
Damnit Chris, now I want a choco banana
I have to say, extremely good and much food for 20 bucks. Good value for the money, as always when eating out in Japan!
I'm late.  But yes, you are going to get torn  apart in the comments.  You truly deserve to be.  But still, great content.
Chris, you are the best in quality and the humor you add to your videos is priceless. I hope I see a tv documentary or anything else that shows others how good you actually are in producing content. Keep up the good work and I hope you make it even farther than just YouTube and reach the world
I would try the dumplings and the chocobanana as neither are available here in Northern Ireland.  Keep up the great work mate.
Lol, you've got a fast food palate.
"Underwhelming Japanese Villain" LOL
If I had to pick a cook for my trip to Japan, Ryotaro would be high on the list.  At least I know the food would be cooked. ;)
That last 1000 YEN set is totally insane. It's good to watch this at 2 A.M. what a nice 😂
In uni in the us right now and I now realize how much they are ripping me off food wise here.
12:30 should i feel insecure about my english or your tongue just broke the sound barrier :)
Chocobanana & fried chicken for breakfast 🥺😍, this guy is my soulmate 😋
I can’t believe I missed this upload..glad I finally got to watch it. Keep enjoying Japan Chris
watching people eat food while its 3:28 AM really makes you peckish and unfortunately, i've nothing to eat
Ryōtaro is the most aggressively-british Japanese person
Mh yes Ryotaro the underwhelming japanese villain xD
Chris, I love you, but this video hurt me a little bit deep inside. What kind of maniac goes to a haven of cheap, delicious Japanese food and zeroes in on a chocolate banana??
ok but why is Ryotaro so handsome tho?
I'm addicted to watching you finding the best food and im like, fully finished after eating food and im still mouth watering over Japanese food sfjdncs
2:06 captions “this is really the worst”
I have a massive want for that gyudon bowl
ひん；；
3:40 I agree with Ryotaro san here.   250 Japanese Yen - 110 Philippine peso  For a chocolate coated banana? That's expensive.
Coming from Food Wars! I already understand amino acids ;)
💪🏻
what peasant foods they have at morning?  chocolate banana?? ah yeah ofcourse they are
Kinda cheap considering Japan is a developed nations with high income.
oh looks all so tasty Ö_Ö
If you get cupnoodle savoury shiitake soup that explains umami so damn great
3:35 That's Geh
"underwhelming japanese villain"
His choice of food is so "white". Sweets...fried... Now here comes his buddy who chose an "Asian" fully loaded meal. 🤣🤣🤣
I missed Japan. Hope the lockdown ends soon.
Rawr
Im soo jealous :(
sausage is best when it's burnttttt
8:44 doge is king
I wish I could eat fried stuff
i guess "umami" could be translated into "freshness".  the good taste that derives from fresh ingredient.  the Chinese share a similar concept in seasoning.
Your mask is giving me anxiety. Looks like you can’t breathe 😢
"Explain it in the way it is good".   That's always my problem
I would have  gotten my whole money to chocolate banana or if there are Strawberrys! xD
“We’re gunna see what he can get, and what I can get, and he’s gunna get some shit!” -Ryotaro 2021
Tuna shit af😂😂😂
I don't judge you for having a choco banana.
Doritos = Umami  taste
great video chris
chocolate banana 😂👍
I’m trying to fast and then you make these videos
Well I guess I’ll be spending more than 40 dollars. Great video👍🏽!
閖上の朝一いいよな〜
Ryotaro doing the Mario theme makes my day.
I have binge watched all of Chris videos and have seen the relationships develop between the various characters. I think its high time for all of them to come together and make a sitcom like Seinfeld.There is Natsuki the hilarious yet profound Kramer, Ryotaro the always cynical George, Sharla as Elaine and Chris around whom the entire thing spins!
Street food making my mouth water every time. Great video.
"it's called well done"- Ryotaro , ahhh I tell myself that every time I decide to cook.
"What have I become?"   A permanent tourist?
The vigorous bed sporadically smell because criminal distinctively clip inside a abrasive acoustic. vigorous, panoramic ink
"you get all your vitamin b...12...your zinc, your copper, your nylon"  EXCUSE ME.....  I-  HE REALLY  now, I may be dumb but I am in set one science and something ain't quite right here.
Should he be the Japanese foreign minister or ambassador, or the economy or trade minister is also suitable
he's a magnet for your videos
7:56 who is that girl? She is really pretty ? Name ?
Ryotaro is a STAR
4:38 "'Cause I'm nice." Ryotaro, visibly reacting "WTF?"
Umami is deliciousness !!! <3 keep the food ones coming - maybe a culinary biketrip across Japan, with the whole gang?
An amazing variety of fresh, healthy and delicious japanese food that will fill you up with joy.  Chris: I want banana
*stares down at bowl of cereal* I'm just...so jealous
Almost sarcastically, I got an advert for a Japanese Internet Service Provider under this video (on mobile). I kind of get the general subject matter, but why that ad, I don't even live there! So pointless...
Whatever you eat... Just say no, to the BEE CHILD. For fucks saké, that phrase still haunts me🐝
I thought at first glance, the intro guy was mtashed xDDD
More of stuff like this
Ryiotoro seems super entertaining. I like his energy :)
Those streets and market look pristine clean unlike London.
I wonder how this entire video haven't been yet copyrighted by the shit scum nintendo corporation cuz Riyotaro hummed mario theme music
This channel has great quality content. The funny dialogue, informative, interesting places, cool friends, camera shots. Not sure why I haven't clicked on the bell 🔔 after all of this time but I did now! Much love. -Minnie
I miss that when I went to Japan 2019 😍
wish i had a chocobanana...
Why did you downgrade the chocolate banana to 6! Got to remain true to your feelings. I would have bought at least 1000 yen worth of them. And definitely chocobanana is worth a 10. I don't care it's a fish market.
Chocolate Banana is on the same level of good as sushi! Don't back down, Chris!
I really miss Japanese morning markets! I miss Japan in general, can’t wait to visit again and enjoy the country and it’s amazing food again! 😬
opening of the video:were you in tramore, I have to say it reminds me of Mini Golf at Tramore Theme Park(especially Mary Nolan)
Nice vid chris!
review super Nintendo land!! this video was awesome ^^
Wow
いいなーいいなー 水餃子！！！
im disappointed he didnt go for the big black banana
a 5k video my god
ah yes nylon my favourite vitamin
People who hurt these videos should be giving us some explanation... coz this is simply amazing food travel videos
I laughed so hard when Chris chose the chocobanana to eat first 😂 you're amazing!
Jā matane
Hungry now.. thanks..  Ik, I'm the one that clicked it..
Legend has it-  The fried chicken comes from Cat island.
I love to see Japanese food, wow I want to travel there after the pandemic
Haha Chris likes chocolate banana in his mouth, don’t eat that in a nude beach Chris.
"Shrimp or fried chicken, which is better?" the answer is obviously fried shrimp
Hearing uncle roger shout FUIYOH in the background at 4:40 has me dead
"Underwhelming Japanese Villian" caught me off guard ;D
Chocobanana... so very English
I just thought of this and figured I might as well ask it here considering it's a video about food. I want to travel to Japan once the world returns to some semblance of normal but I'm concerned about one thing: I'm allergic to shrimp and I'd be really worried about accidentally buying food that has shrimp in it. Any advice on how best to avoid that dilemma?
I WANT ALL OF THIS 😅😋🍴
I can't believe you bought a chocolate banana first lmao
"You get all your vitamins, zinc, coppEr, nYLoN"
*vEh-eh-min*
Best ones were the karage pieces!
The chocolate banana...that I saw earlier! Lol
Wow suigyoza look delicious, i hope somebody will make the Halal version when international tourism opens again. i will munch bowls, ... bowls ... of it.
I would love to Experience that Market.Now I'm Hungry🤣
Chocolate Banana
It all looks really tasty but none of it is what I would call breakfast food. U thought this was morning market?
Holy Magikarp the BBQ prices man.. I wish we had this sort of stuff in Canada - where you can just go buy the fish and take a free grill spot and make it all right there. 5$ for the big arse fish portion, then like 10$ for enough fresh meats/fish for two on the grill? That's amazing! :'D  Also, that chocobanana looked good, but the karage looked better - JS.
I love this: Chris 'off to get more chocobanana' Reotoro 'peasent!'
I agree with Ryotaro. Savory breakfast > sweet breakfast.
I'm interested in what the logistics are of 'renting' out one of those grills - are they kept hot? Do you have to buy charcoal from a vendor nearby to start up your barbecue? How long does it take to prepare the coals, if so? I respect the beeline for the banana in the face of such responsibility - trust me to fuck up a beautiful, freshly caught fish.
Chocobanana in the morning as breakfast..., so unhealthy and high on calories.
Umami = added MSG😂
Who else is eating a sandwich and trying to imagine how the food in the video tastes like
LOL the ending Chris: Yeee chocolate bananaaaa~ Ryotaro: PEASANT 😂😂😂
Everything is great but you know what caught my eye? Tiny ryotaro 5:30 munching dumplings 🥺
I like ryotaro's choices better personally. Not the fact that it's healthy, the mixture of flavours just goes well together unlike a chocobanana+fried chicken but it came close since the 3 bowls definitely made up
Chris and Ryotaro are really cute together
mmm... i don't know about you guys but this gave me a serious amino acid craving
1:17 doggos in a bag alert
Chocolatebanana... okay. I'm with you. I think I would've tried that too, if nobody was watching... BUT THE PINK ONE?!     o.O
I thought the choco banana was supposed to be a donut on a stick and I feel stupid now
10/10 would also go straight for that choco banana
Pshh I was at sendai like a few days ago. On Persona 5 Scrambles that is ahha
0:44 this shot is underappreciated.
Umami= monosodium glutamate
The way Ryotaro holds chopsticks is so weird! I can't even figure out how that works!
Fried chicken, massive shrimp, etc., etc. I have GOT to get to Sendai.
“This is really the worth.”  “Do you feel the seaweed though?” “Tuna Shit.”  “Like a Mario." *whilst singing Mario tune* ~ Risottoro, February 2021
This is probably just me but Ryotaro sounds like a lot like Gorden Ramsey
8:18 woah those 2 ladies serving the noodles are stunning
Does Ryotaro have perfect pitch? His mario tune was in the correct key. Just found that noteworthy.
Getting that radioactive Sendai fish lol?
Who else is just here for food porn because you miss the food you used to eat and now you’re on the other side of the world it’s kinda impossible to eat them again?
i shouldn't watch this videos when im hungry
I love how ryotaro holds the the money like a kid with tickets at Chuck E. Cheese. The chemistry is amazing keep doing the lords work Chris
“Fried chicken, or fried shrimp? I think we all know the answer.”  But can you know, though? I love both. You can’t make me choose one over the other Chris.
I would say that Chris looks the happiest out of them while eating the food he picks so Chris wins for me and yes I do want a chocobanana
of course chris goes with a chocolate banana... no wonder he cant lose weight 😂
suigyoza 水ぎょざ is basically pelmeni пельмени sounds good to me 😁 id love to eat it.
My mouth is watering over shrimp and pork gyoza with a mountain of kimchi on top while I'm sitting here eating my breakfast of lukewarm fried rice with too much garlic.
I really applicate to see your amusing the JAPAN.  Enjoy !!
Your videos always make me smile! Thanks for the laughs, and for the new perspective your videos give!
God... take me there... I AM STARVING!
Would you say that the Japanese see you as a 'gaijin' even if you speak Japanese well and conform to Japanese culture?
Hi Chris  I really enjoy the content you produce. Your traveling Videos have inspired me to clime a mountain for a Chickpea Smoothy. I was surprised to find a 仙台キリシタン殉教碑 (Sendai Christian Martyrdom Monument) at the foot of the hill near the bridge.  Next time try the "Cooking for your self". Unless you enjoy blaming Ryotaro ? :-P
Omg sooo good. Need to go back to Japan ! Covid go away!
Chris, I’d wish you made a video on Date Masamune-related sightseeing spots, would love to listen to your comment 🤣
This guy is a walking content genius
8:42 First frame of Shibe
5:28 I kinda vibe with Ryutaro in the background
It's only Japanese if you say it "baanana".
When are you going to visit a horse race? I'd like to see how they do over there and I'd like to skip the flight.
Umami: It tastes like addiction
April 1st, as a joke you should rebrand to "Chris England".
I have a question about a vaccine shot. Friends in USA got it. Some forigner living in Japan want a vaccine. Japanese government delay of decision. That delay has a good side and a bad side, but  I want to hear your opinion about it. I am a japanese and don't want it honestly.
Bro I love your videos. You so funny and cool. After 7 years you finally got 2 million subscribers. Congratulations ! I just want to make a suggestion. Please make reaction videos about other things other than japan. Don't limit your audience for making videos about japan only. You are funny and cool to talk about japan only. Talk about other things. Talk about movies, music, talk about other issues or other people videos. That would be fun. I interested about japan that's why I came across your videos. If you start make videos about other things people that not interested about japan would know you and watch your videos. For example my fellow malaysian youtuber uncle Roger who lives in uk started to be famous a year ago after he made reaction video about fried rice. Now he got 3 million subscribers ! He talked about many things. Don't limit your audience. Make videos other than japan. Please consider this suggestion !
Ryotaro literally has some straight bars 🔥 “what you can get and what I can get and he’s gonna get some shit”
Man, that assorted BBQ platter looked delish!
So gooood!!!!
Is this the Food Network? Oh, it's just a couple guys EATING again. Looks like fun though!
Umami: a harmonious mixture of flavors, perfectly balanced. Does that sound like a good definition...😐
Wow! The kimchi and gyoza look great!
Love your food videos!
8:44 Shiba INUUUUUUU
Can you make a video going through club sega
have been watching this channel since 2013 and now it's time to subscribe, I know I'm a bad viewer but Chris, you remind me of my English teacher 🖤 . . . Love Abroad in Japan
Ok... next? Feed your voracious public.  We demand entertainment.  New video please.
7:12 *Ainsley flashbacks*
umami is a sweetness that goes well with savory foods.
I love watching these videos, a great escape during the lockdown.  Especially enjoy the videos with both Chris and Ryotaro, not sure about the pepto bismol coloured banana though
It just struck me who Ryotaro reminds me of.. Ootaru Ozawa..
My favourite food channel 😍😍
ever since i was little when i go to visit family in japan and go to the markets or festivals the chocolate banana is my favorite thing lol
Nice video i want to eat  I love Japan
I would buy the bannana too.
Ryotaro: *Sings Mario theme*  Nintendo's legal team: "Allow us to introduce ourselves"
It's 2 in the morning while I'm watching this and now I'm drooling and hangry.
0:47 "Underwhelming Japanese Villain" My god that made me laugh!
Where’s the chicken and broccoli
I love watching this shit high as fuck
2:58 the pink bananas make me uncomfortable
I'm the type who would buy a chocolate banana at a Japanese market tho 🤣
To be fair I sometimes have banana in the morning... sliced and grilled with smoky bacon and maple syrup on a pancake (Crepe as the french would call it... so not american pancakes).  If they had that at a Japanese market I'd have to try it to see what they did with the flavour.
Hey Chris, I was wondering if you know the channel Life where I'm from and if you ever thought of working with him together. Greetings from Vienna :D
The real question is does chris get ladies
Look at this broad in japan
Ryotaro channelling his inner Rachel Hunter.
Nothing like having a bbq and a burnt sausage
Is this the new food reviewer channel?
Love Japan, i really wanna go there.
*cocks hammer*  Wheres the Abura Soba video, Chris
こういう英語で日本のものを紹介してる動画を見ると、英語が多少苦手でも英語が勉強できる
I loved Sendia Best time I've had in japan. if I'm spelling this right.
DONE!!!! I watched ALL OF YOUR VIDEOS from the start to finish!!! Yes!!! Also the Podcast. Great fuckinh work. Thank god you do youtube ^^
Japanese karage is the best for me. 🥰
I never want anything sweet for breakfast. You didn't even get actual chocolate on the banana smh
I’m Japanese  I’m wanna talk with a English Speaker in English and Japanese  Please let me know if you are interested in📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚📚
Is it just me or did Ryotaro look kinda like squidward in that first scene
I miss Japan
That entire barbecue platter for $15ish is blowing my mind. It would be X3 that in the states if you could even get such a thing.
Chocobanana for breakfast!? excellent choice Chris, one I can only second going for! The British accent pirate should try it too ;)
Why so mean.. Little bit too much :(
"Amino acid they call it !". Lol
Ryotaro - Underwhelming Japanese Villan
i would love to try the gyoza but i must admit i also have a soft spot for choco-banannas and tend to get those at markets too XD i did not know it was a ..japanese thing :P lol...but they tend to be sold on like..erm...a..fair thingy  .....why do i always watch these when I'm hungry..damn you...i should make dinner...
hey guys I watched a video and chris said in it the 5 words textbooks never teach but they are used a lot and I cant find the video please someone help.
You should do a food can review and call it Abroad in a Can
He's really starting to pick up your British accent, have you noticed?
was going to be in japan soon cant anymore cuz covid :( im so jealous
He thought up until 2020 so cheers for still being in Japan! HOPE YOU STAY FOR MORE YEARS TO COME   https://youtu.be/VJ74Gv30jEY
Question: Do you recommend teaching English in Japan with the jet program?
What happen to your instagram? Did you get hacked?
There’s always money in the banana stand
Keep eating,starting to look like a like a sumo wrestler.
The mellow poultry characteristically drum because jail thoracically jump from a gray greasy great susan. mushy, wistful grease
pls do more of these
Hi Chris, long time viewer/first time commenter. Watching here from Ireland and cant thank you enough for all the hard work you put into each video. Nothing better than chilling out on a rainy day inside and catching up on your videos. I get a chance with your videos to see a part of the world that I hope to someday visit.  Keep up the great work. You're amazing.
great. wait, are they a couple?
My favourite videos from Chris is about them eating.
Tripice u Japanu lol
If theres one thing I know it's that this man loves the song cat's walking, to be fair so do I
「うま味」は、「アミノ酸」じゃなくて「グルタミン酸」「イノシン酸」「グアニル酸」とかだよ。
I NEED MORE VIDEOS CHRIS !!! Lol
yo, colab with mikey chen from strictly dumpling
Go to the fish market and grab as much raw seafood as you can and make a video of you eating it. Content in Japan.
These seem way better than Chicken and Broccoli
Chris, who are some of your favorite Japanese bands? I really like Miyavi and I saw him in NYC back in 2010. Oh and BBHF are great too!
I once had a chocolate-covered banana. I was bitterly disappointed.
ive always watched your videos and was often jealous of your trips. i myself am a linguist of Japanese, Chinese Mandarin and Korean and have always wanted to visit. please sensei, teach me how to be as successful as you so that i too can travel like you and hopefully one day have the opportunity to meet and thank you in person! (too personal isnt it?) P.S. your food always looks amazing!
>has a hot dog on a stick >picks up the hotdogs with chopsticks
I need my Vitamin Nylon
PEASANT!!!
i love you
Chris goes right to the banana stand, proving George Bluth's timeless wisdom.
In all fairness, its recently come out in the US that the best time to eat chocolate is in the moring. The reason behind it is that it gives your body all day to burn off those calories/surger.
Hi! I'm looking forward to your next video Chris. Love all your vids and im envyous of you living in japan but at least i can have the experience from your point of view in my favourit accent. Nothing compares to lovely british accents. Im sorry for the rest but rule britannia!!! (my gran is from the Uk so im biased and im swed/french and live in spain so...) LOVE YOU! And as for what i would choose, i'd choose the combined dish with fresh fish and a chocobanana maybe, i'm not a big banana fan.
Great vid, commenting for the algorithm
You've run out of ideas Just kidding. Your content is the best on youtube.
I get bullied and left a lot but watching abroad in Japan makes me so happy, I cant wait to live in Japan!
Ryotaro ruined all three bowl shots with his finger.
Abroad in Japan. More like Abread in Japan.
Hey Chris. I recently started learning Japanese.  And I noticed that the language has a lot of foreign influences. I know that many terms have been adopted because there was no term for them in Japanese. But terms for robusuta (lobster), yumoa (humor) or desato (dessert) must have existed before western influences. Could you make a video about the change in the japanese language and how it was influenced? And I want to give a huge compliment to you and your production team. The quality of the videos is great. Your documentaries have great potential to be broadcast worldwide on television. Keep up the good work :)
WARNING:  possibility of an earthquake this week as strong as the one in 2011.   Current seismic trends similar to those of 2011.
If I tried to buy all this in Canada or USA...I’d have to spend $100 LOL  Food markets like this are more expensive than usual eating out. They charge you an arm and a leg and take your monthly allowance away
DO YOU FEEL THE SEAWEED CHRIS? DO YA?
woah 5K res! laughs in built PC
Take me to tokyo
Those clouds look amazing.. They’ve got to be fake..  Nice video editing..
I just found your channel and I'm upset I've missed out on this content for so long.    I love this!!
ryotaro is such a daddy
in every meal, you eat the fruit first before anything else. that's the right way to do it.
Great video!! Would love to go there...
FINALLY RYOTARO IS BACK
Why is everyone calling him Ryotaro when it's been well established that his name is Risottoro?!?!
I think it's fair to say, Japan is literally on everyones travel bucket list.
1500 Yen for a full barbeque... Im moving to japan forever
#askabroad As an IT Technician, I'm very interested in this, do not dare to laugh. What is the most common operating system used in Japan? Also, they use it with their native language or rather English?
The Main Issue  is once somebody bring me a Beer and I surrender, finish the day (at  7am in the morning)  maybe.
Banana, chocolate, and chicken. That would have been what I would want mixed up in one bowl, too. With a side dish of beef intestine. Yummmmmm.
Haven't you been damaged by the earthquake? Hope you are OK.
This comment is best!
When are you doing the episode where you meet with Peter Barakan? Possibly the first british born japan video blogger. And if that thought hasn't crossed your mind already EAT SHIT
Watching Ryo and Chris is like adding sult and pepper to a great dish.... i mean video! If they were doing one channel it would’ve been a much greater channel for sure
1:16 those pups in that guys pockets? to the right lol
I know you mentioned in a previous video of how you had a bad experience visiting Tokyo Disney, but would you ever consider doing a video on theme parks? Especially with the new Super Nintendo World at Universal Japan.
Man. This really makes me embarrassed in the US. We pay just as much money, to get lower quality, quantity and it's typically unhealthier.
Justice Delicious
spoiler: more than in the USA LOL
Any plans to visit super nintendo world?
So was all these food much better the the Veggie Burger you had on anther channel video?
That 5K is crisp.
最近日本語字幕無くて悲しい出来れば日本語字幕つけて欲しいです！！！
i fucking died when risotaro said "its well done"
I love ristretto's hearty laugh
you should do a videi where you learn traditional japaneese jiujutsu or judo
日本人です。ネットにあった記事を見て来ました。これからも日本の魅力を海外の方々に伝えてください！これからも頑張ってください！
Hey, hope you're OK. Heard about the earthquake.
► You Should know about these Best Street Foods out there: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Z8HPRvpwyQ2tEjIznRKtIbeDZ_smpcf
I really want to go there. A lot of lovely foods !
Are you the guy in the old video titled "Saran wrap prank on crabby roommate"??
Crisp Rod back at it again with the eating videos I see.
The chocobanana is accurate
I read the quite impressing article about you on your Twitter. Everyone not only Japanese also foreigners should read it!!
Bro' Takashi Kimura (m.o.v.e producer) said in his facebook that he wanna work with you but he doesn't have a contact
Living vicariously through Chris and Ryotaro during this pandemic is bringing me joy. Thank you both.
2:25: Ryotaro splits the chopsticks with his teeth as the master of Street Food he is.
Hey, are you guys doing okay after that earthquake?
I'm sorry I can't speak English😭  Real soundという日本語の記事から…！ 英語が苦手な私でも楽しく拝見させていただきました(｡ᵕᴗᵕ｡)とっても安くて美味しそう♡
I need more videos DAVE !!!
hello I plan to travel to Japan early April from the United States and having a ton of confusion about covid travel ban restrictions. maybe make a small vid to help some of us out planning a trip soon?
I'm Jewish and those sound effects made me think twice about trying a pork dumpling.  Looool.
Iam so going to be creating some banana on a stick with Skittles 😏😏🤭🤭
Ha ha ha I love this made me laugh well done guys
Realy cool video mate :D Greetings from Germany! Peace <3
Chocobananna xD
2月にTシャツ？！
How the hell is Ryotoro using chopsticks like that? Someone teach me please
“I don’t think so” 🤣😂🤣😂
Oh I totally forgot congratulations on the new car!!!
地震大丈夫でしたか？？🙄 ケガしてませんか？
I love Chicken Kara-age😍 All Japanese foods are too tasty😋
I was actually half expecting yakisoba, breakfast style ramen, curry, and just any fish-based soups in markets like these, but never would I imagine a chocolate banana. I just felt sad that they didn't eat that bbq with rice.
Control yourself you become big face.
Go to Sanrio Puroland in your next video!
For White Day, you should make the girls chocolates made with imported Swiss chocolate. REALLY go all out on the design and decorations md show them up in an historic fashion. It would make for an entertaining video at least
The abrasive half-sister clasically supply because comma noticeably search times a frightened frightening full fumbling functional vegetarian. lacking, remarkable jute
Everytime Chris stops to speak to camera, he ends the scene by walking out of shot lol
Great video Chris! 5k looks amazing too.  panasonic S1H right?
They say: "it is dirty cheap, just 20 dollars". While I'm here thinking, holy shit that's 10% of a minimum wage here (monthly)
No wonder the Bluth's said there was always money in the banana stand. Chris is probably one of the main drivers behind their profits.
Just heard about the earthquake...hoping that you, your friends and everyone in the affected areas are safe. 🙏🏻
Loved it
地震大丈夫でしたか？
Tuna gill/jaw is tasty. Marinade it with soy sauce and lemon then grill it.
The ethereal dinosaur tribally watch because mist notably behave amidst a keen detail. feeble feigned, soggy illegal
@Chris: Hope you're doing well. Quite a jolt you must have gotten up north, just now. Tokyo was shaking for a minute or so, not heavily though. But JMA says it was two 7.1 magnitudes. Be safe.
I love you, handsome son of a b****
クリスさん地震大丈夫ですか！？！？！？！？
Bananas 🤢. Not if you are prone to sulphur burps like me.
My mother wanted me to put a comment for videos to do, so here I am.  She said that Japanese employees start their day with company exercise (at the train station ) and ends the day drinking together.    Other suggestions for potential videos: Shiretoko onsen Daisetsuzan National Park (when you hike the top of the mountain, it's completely flat, so you can keep walking across all of them.) The Detective Conan pilgrimage (Museum + landmarks) Mount Rokko cable cars French-Japanese Fusion food in Kobe.
Chris, come to my town. I’ll hook you up with Gyoza and Unagi! Hit me up!
Funny, I just explained what umami flavor is to my wife today and coincidentally it was exactly the same. On the spectrum of salty, sweet, and savory and has the characteristic of making you want to keep eating. It can be attached to elements of sour typically from fermented foods, or salty like pork or seaweed/kelp and other ocean products, or savory from mushrooms or onions and meat, or from cooking techniques such as braised, roasted, or barbecued foods.
I would love to see a grant cook off challenge series between the ever handsome Iron Chef Risottoro, the crazy Iron Chef Natsuki and the imaginary Iron Chef Chris the pretender.    How will they battle to make a mouthwatering okonomiyaki in 10 seconds and 5 challenge ingredients?  Will Chris come out on top in the dangerous hot oil chicken karage super challenge, or will all the chicken end up being snatch away by his relentless love for fried chicken, before being plated?  Will judge Sharla be impressed with the shenanigans that results in something vaguely resembling gyouza? Or perhaps Iron Chef Risottoro will finally live up to his name with a Japanese Fugu twist to the dish, that will finally kill Chris? ... All to enjoy... in a challenge where Chris can finally apply and show off his enormous kitchen skill after his many years of culinary training by the masters of 7Eleven, FamilyMart and Lawson, while travelling around Japan.
This was on my bucket list if not for the pandemic. I miss going around Tohoku.
Hey Chris,  Greetings. I regularly watch your videos and I want you to colab with a YouTuber "Rom Rom ji". He also does vlogs in Japan.
9:25 I was listening while cooking and thought you said Watanabe. I was like, NO! Don't eat Ken!
That kim-chee looks amazing
10:24 beef bowl beef bowl
https://youtube.com/watch?v=pak3tO7CZFU&feature=share
The open fire in the market is super cool.
Lol I can’t get over the chocolate banana 🍌 love chocolate too and banana 😝🤣
3000 calories is all you need Chris .
Watching Ryotaro separate chopsticks with his teeth* *Me ~unexpected doki~doki~ O_O
Those bloody bananas are freaking morish!!
“Don’t stomach too much”
8:00 the girl on the food stall is pretty
Missed Ritesaeru
Sooo...what with the umami tsunami  produced by fried chicken and grilled surf & turf, I'm compelled to ask:   Where's the biru?!?  I know it's not just a breakfast beverage, but, come on...I've far too much Irish DNA to be kidding. 😁
Chris can eat! I have to give him that. Not as much as the eating champion thin girl, but he also can some day became an eating champion too, if he tries hard enough.
Nice little editing music
Ryotaro looks like Ryan Reynolds when he puts on the mask
U can get tripple the size of all the food u bought for 10 dollars in northeast India XD
I just want chicken
Would you look at this, you fine lad... Japan´s giving away houses for FREE... Yes! Basically no catch! I just found out about this myself and I must say I´m quite amused, although I´m not the queen so... doesn´t really matter does it? Anyways lookie here: https://inakanoseikatsu.com/ there´s categories on the left on which you can select the TOP one with the 0円 in it. That mean´s zero Yen... because it cost´s zero Yen!
Umami in Arabic i think its مرقة 😂😂
When are you going to do a video of the Manga Kissas?
It's all and nice but i could just buy 4 full size wholesome meat pizzas for 20$.
God I wish things were open like this
Having lived in Korea, Japan and Thailand (thereby having my fair share of streetfood) I can honestly say that I do not miss Japanese street or market food at all. They ruin kimchee and the rest of it is simply overrated.
When Japan opens and I can see my wife again, I want to take her here.
Chris uses chopsticks much better than Ryotaro.
Absolutely love this!!! I have recently moved to Tokyo 🗼 and am totally loving it here!!
So mostly junk foods with processed sugar and deep fried cooking oil??   Also burning cheap seafoods and seaweed that grows everywhere???   Lol try to eat healthy next time.
How much would it cost me to be your friend? If corona ends I want to go to Japan
Ryotaro and Natsuki are very entertaining and interesting friends to have. I love seeing you hangout with them. I wish I can go back to Japan again and enjoy all the wonderful food and sites!
Lol "rawr."
Something only just occurred to me: Not only is Chris Abroad in Japan But he is also A Broad in Japan
Chris really went for the closest thing to a donut he could find
Dayyum great karaage
Chris and Ryotaro look like a couple wearing  twinning outfits and going out for a date in the market lol
I need to ask, because in the first 6.26 minutes, they aren't drinking nothing, there is free water that you can drink there?
more of these  pleaseeee * ^ *
There's always money in the banana stand.
Hey Chris, i got two questions for you, you may know, germans never seem to find good bread outside of germany, so my first question is: is there any good bread in japan? And my second question would be: is smoking a No-Go for japanese girls, makes you more attractive or does it matter at all? would be great to get an answer to these :)
i think the tuna gill is tuna collar. Gills (the organ fish breathe with) are not edible
Garlic Seaweed Chiken Karage 🤤
I just remember the buzzfeed worrth itu video where they go to aquafarm chichibu egg farm so i serached for that farm on youtube and almost no one make a video about it so that's a video idea for you chris. I hope you see this
I would go for the chocolate banana too!
The rotten ox microcephaly request because frame genetically deserve opposite a inconclusive sandwich. tangy, testy seeder
I would try a little of each of the chicken flavors.
Gyudon is my all time favourite japanese food with karage very close behind
really wanted to know how tuna gills tasted but that was skipped over
Me everytime a few days go by without a new video:  "can i haz more content?"
Why do I got hungry again after finished eating.
ily
underwhelming japanese villain xD
Love this video Chris! This feels more like the Abroad in Japan I subscribed to...
Missed a perfect opportunity to get a 2000yen banknote. For shame, Chris Broad.
ur getting fatter chris.
2022?
Man oh man I'm hungry 🤤
Are you two together? Cuz i ship you guys so hard 😭🥰💖
I miss chicken nanban, probably one of the best dishes, and nowhere to be found in USA 🤤😭
That's a lot of stuff you can buy with 20 dollars. I can hardly buy 1/3 of the stuff you have except the noodles
Chocolate banana was the first thing I ate when I went to Japan for the first time, followed by a Karaage skewer 😄
isn't this that place that got hit by that big ass tsunami???
Congratulations on 2 Million subscribers Chris!
Hell of breakfast. Spicy noodles. Not in the morning. 😂
8:40 Video claimed by Nintendo
Do you really have to mock his accent and broken English 😐
i love how you can get so much for so little.
Isn't umami just savoriness? Not sure why people make such a big deal out of it. The idea that a basic taste was "discovered" a mere century ago is also silly.
NYLON! That's what my diets been missing.
Motsu nabe mai kai! One of the things I miss most. That, yamma-chan and basashi. Aiichi-ken represent :)
Food is good fish is good but don't eat too much got to work out sometimes 🙂
chris breakfast fried chicken
Look at you, out and about while the real Chris Broad is still in the basement..
A British caveman with a Japanese drunk
You are legit one of my most favorite youtubers when it comes to traveling, youve shown parts of Japan that most dont show.  And you sound like Jack Sparrow.
I feel like you're trolling by chosing the banana over the dumplings
Forget the good looking food.  Who wants chris to try the sour cream and onion pringles flavoured instant yakisoba?
Remember folks, there's always money in a banana stand.
Don't think for a second I didn't spot that puppy bag at 1:16
‘There’s always money in the banana stand’ Chris :)
💕💕💕💕
Our favorite buddy cop duo is at it again
I must speak Ryotaro's version of english. "giving the right judge" = "you think you're a top-tier food critic, huh?"
This is so cute 😬 They’re even wearing the matching clothes. I’m surprised that this isn’t a bigger thing than Chris and Sharla.
4:40 Uncle Roger comes to the market
I SPOTTED DOGE!!! 8:43
What happened to your head Chris?  You need to go see Natsuki for a new hair cut lol ^_^
Ryotaro's dodgy BBQ, week nights at 6pm on BBC 2  Welp, theres my pitch for a new show
I wana see Chris do a 48 hour vegan challenge. funny/torture as hell!!
Ryotaros English just getting better and better. <3
Chocolate banana over anything else.
Eating from the same bowl
Hey Chris so what was the tuna fin like?
Risottaro is the funny!
We he took that first bite of pork dumpling, my mouth never watered so fast. :o
4:40 „Fuyioh!“
Excellent show of two friends. Lauging. Strolling and praising and eating. The sight of all the delicious food made my mouth water, my stomach rumble. It is 19.00 hrs overhere Netherlands.
visit tsugaru or tōkamachi
The heartburn is e-real.
I love getting my nylon from my bananas 😂
5:20 "Banana on a sick"
have you ever use a health delivery service?
Umami, the taste of addiction.
Bona apple tea
U look like alexander vlahos 😁
“Cho- PEASANT!” 🤣🤣🤣
THREE bowls for 1000¥??? One of those would cost that much here in Australia 😭
Ryotoro needs some merch for his channel saying ''this is really the worth''.
Chocobanana is amazing
8:44 cutest thing I have ever seen      (S H I B A    I N U)
LOL "destroying my breakfast" "the world's worst chef"
0:19 is that isayama....😂🤣
With all that good, mouthwatering food, I'm getting immense food envy from my end here. I can only imagine what it's like for your cameraman. I hope he had his share behind the scenes too!  😅
Lol I love how much shit you guys talk about each other
Did you just... EAT WHILE WALKING? 😂
Ryotaro is da bomb!
Ryotaro is hilarious 🤣
The chocolate banana looked best followed by the beef/onion/rice dish! :-)
I want whatever mask Chris is wearing it looks really good. All the masks here are so just so basic
RAWRoytaro
Chris you need to shave the sides of your head to about a one or two amd kill the fade, slick the top back !! You have a good face you need to exploit that lol. Killer look killer personality, huge fan your the only YouTuber I actually enjoy watching 👊keep up the sick travel content it's top notch and my personal favorite with some of the best shots I have ever seen. It always been my dream to travel to Japan so I use your channel to live vicariously through you until I do thanks for being you brother have a good one. PLEASE DO NOT STOP DOING TRAVEL CONTENT!!!!  And tell your nemesis to just shave his head already this way he will complete the villan look, lol like a Japanese doctor evil.
お皿を返した？
I love how ryotaro makes Chris wake up early
Fresh fish??? Of course. 💖💖💖
Ryotaro is trying too hard to be "the cool guy" these days. Old Ryotaro was better.
damn Ryo finessed your ass on the 1000 yen platter
8:00 give me information about the shop. she is Cute
Here it is, the episode just like the typical Japanese TV program lol. Just missing the reaction cam and the 2 girls going OISHIIII
This is the first time Ryotaro has been violated by Chris.
Just waiting for that random "PEASANT".
this is super cheap it seems, but I'm guessing you "renewed" your budget several times?
Man... this made me hungry...
Is the charcoal for the bbq free? I assume you bought it from someone at the market no?
I have heard that fresh fruit is very expensive in Japan, including such things as apples and the aforementioned strawberries. This would be an interesting topic to discuss, as I have always been pretty lucky to have great selection of local fruit from Washington State and British Columbia including all manner of apples, berries, etc. I have even heard that Japan imports some fruits like Washington Red Delicious apples.  Are these prices over-inflated for any particular reason, or are the high prices reserved for special cases? Seems like there is a market for these extravagant items but is this the equivalent of designer handbags where its more about the status associated with these high cost luxury items?
I feel the seaweed.  Lol.
Please say you got the chocobanana for the memes
Okay but chocolate bananas are so underrated. I'm sorry you got the pink one, the regular (brown) chocolate banana, nevertheless, was the highlight of my first trip in Japan 4 years ago.  Got in in Kyoto during gion matsuri, feels bizarre looking back at that day and the crowd in the current situation (social distancing and all). The place was packed, such a great mood - and a great moment for a sweet, cold and crispy chocolate banana.
Ryottoro episodes are the best!
I'm with him on the chocolate nana :)
Ryotaro is the best! I'm always happy to see him in these videos 😂
Fascinating, if you’ve ever been on holiday and had a hotel breakfast, it’s never hard to guess who the British tourists are, they go straight for the cakes and desserts, no matter how early it is ... and Chris went straight for the Chocco banana go figures 🤷‍♂️ 🇬🇧
Now I just want to eat food... but Im too lazy too cook. This is torture.
9:53 how the hell is Chris not freezing in a t-shirt
I  definitely know the answer to fried chicken, or fried shrimp... BOTH!!
Chocobanana. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
My kingdom for some good chikin karaage
7 in the morning. Poor, poor Chris.
I love Ryotaro! :D He's so upbeat and deals with Chris which shows his patience and kindness ;)  Just kidding! Great video Chris :) You look great! Hope you're safe!
Chocolate banana 🤪🤪🤪🤪
I like how you call them sprinkles and not something British (read: silly) like sugar strands or hundreds-and-thousands.
Ah yes, this looks likes it tastes very amino acid. Delicious.
Bananas are a good source of potassium you twit.
"There's money in that banana stand"
Chocobanana is part of Japanese sweets. Not cusine. Sweets don't count as cuisine. You eat both, they are kinda related …but they are distinctly and significantly different.
Given that savory is any tastiness, aside from sweet/bitter, so saying that umami is savory doesn't really say anything …and I think that naming the taste "umami", which is already the Japanese word for tastiness/deliciousness (you can have umami [tastiness], that is completely devoid of umami [the fifth taste]), is just confusing and misleading, making it a very bad term …though only in Japanese, of course. In non-Japanese languages, it only has the meaning of the fifth taste. (hence no confusion)
I loved that the definition of umami doesn{t define anything
I really get annoyed by the common mistranslation of katsuo (generally in the form of katsuobushi), as bonito. Katsuo is skipjack tuna. *Not* bonito. Though it should be noted that some cheaper katsuobushi (or rather _alternatives_ to katsuobushi) are made using bonito, katsuo as well as typical katsuobushi, is nevertheless not bonito, but skipjack tuna.
anyoe else notice the 5k option
Having sweets for breakfas… (or _any_ meal, really) That's just wrong. As dessert, after the meal proper, sure, but…
Hey chris how much money will i bring if i travel to japen for 7 days
**looks up the name Yuriage** So… shake+up? (not "shake up") So yuri like in yurikago ?(cradle. Shake[well, more like rock]+basket) How disappointing. I heard Yuriage, and thought of deep-frying lilies ;)
Answer: very good food
Oh I'd love me some tuna shit
That was kind of pricey though, In my country in a market 20 usd would get you *a lot*
Hi Chris, I hope you see this comment. I've been watching your videos for a while now. They're great and especially when I miss Japan so much! I am an Australian living in Thailand and have been thinking of living in Japan for some time now. I want to ask you..what visa can you live on there when you don't work for any company? Please advise..thank you.
comment for algorithm
Risottoro being bad at cooking? Impossible, you don't get named after food and then be bad at cooking
Chris is following that American diet I see lol
..8:00 - Go back and ask for the name of the lady who sells the " Kyushu and Okinawa Bowls " and don't forget the choco n sprinkles banana.
I swear your videos are vicariously keeping me so happy!! Thank you so much for all you do! I really want to move to Japan and your videos just make it more and more concrete. 🥰
Umami: addiction 😂😂😂
This is probably chris favourite type of video to do, but i dont blame him 🤤😭🙈🙉🙊
Now I feel hungry after watching this....
cool
Tsh, the only reason Ryotoro is cooking, is because Chris is even worse at cooking!
Ryotaro looks like ozawa tooru. If you know you know
Chris definetely had a good time with Ryotaro's mispellings while the latter didn't give a Mario about those
Doctor : Let's have a good, nutriti-  Chris: CHOCOBANANA CHICKEN KARAAGE
looks like you lost some weight. Good for you, it is very hard to do so.
When you been watching a channel for years but not sub until now rip
its blacker than the choco banana :)
Watching this at the middle of the night was a mistake
I wished I would have a local friend like Ryotaro in my tour of Japan, would be so much fun to have buddy like him.
Choco banana ftw
That tummy....who can blame him....japan has lots to offer
Chris i'm worried you're getting fat again. Please do another 2000km cycle.
who crazy people that spend $20 for street food ?  you can life whole week with $20
That shiba inu at 8:44 is so cute.
1:17 awww look at those cute puppers, cozy together in a bag!
These videos are so wholesome to watch, I love it.
What $20 gets you where I come from: 2 pizzas (not the fancy ones)
dog and cats eats chris in japan its conner and u  all ways sad times am am i rhit i am druck so u know spell  erro
I am living for those little food dances 😍😎I love doing those as well. You go Ryotaro 😎
Can you do like a dessert bakery version style Paul Hollywood and Mary berry version of looking at the bakery goods at the Japanese market
Gordon Ramsay to ryotorio it's burnt
2m subscriber special?
Out of that huge bbq you only showed and ate the small sausage? 😄😄
i don't think these were very cost performance
Chocolate Banana!
Ryotaro: Starts humming Mario theme song Nintendo: NANI!!!!
#ASKABROAD What is the furthest south point in Japan which you have been to? I know you have been to Kyushu but which point is the furthest south there which you have visited?
Everyone should take inspiration from chris. By starting off with a healthy banana, he demonstrated how he lives a balanced lifestyle
Chris you should do a gluten free guide to Japan it would be really helpful for me and the celiac community who are interested in going to Japan!
I would have gone for the miso karaage rather than the garlic
"Again. Its's called well done. That's what it is."
You plus your channel is making me miss japan so much! Cheap quality food!!!
The chocolate banana practically looked dutch with them chocolate sprinkles. Great choice!
chris and all his friends (ryotaro, sharla, natsuki) are honestly just so wholesome and fun to watch, I can't wait for every video
I feel so disrespectful watching this on 480p ._.
The price of your breakfast can feed my family for a week
Banana chocolate for scale
Best opening line ever, "underwhelming Japanese villain".
I would swear that beef bowl was a bowl of Bacon. Man my tongue would be so disappointed
Love you mate,  no homo
here in the philippines, you could have a buffet with that amount. and in some areas you can have buffet 4 times. yes 4x. because in some areas it only costs $6. and it's a fine restaurant mind you. not some park stall.
Not even 2000 yen could save Ryatoro's haircut. Sad.
Damn I miss the food there.  I was often unable to say no to some yakisoba at street markets.
Whats the song at the beginning
Collab with Kimagure cook when?
wait! if umami just means savory why don't people just say savory?
I like it how Chris walk out of frame every time he finish a sentence 😅
i wonder if this market is a daily thing, my son is going close to Sendai
I've come to the conclusion that Japan is not a Celiac friendly country! Guess I'll have to rent do the majority of the cooking myself.
9:45  Umami = Amino Acid by Ryotaro.  You probably mean Glutamate.
NGL, as someone allergic to shellfish, that chicken looked absolutely amazing
Ryotaro`s pronunciation`s becoming creapy accurate
Umami?  You mean MSG? x)
Chocobanana looks amazing. I'd def get one of them.
A fun local market. Looks like a great way to start a weekend or morning trip
I'm with Chris on this one...Choco banana and fried chicken for breakfast and the World's your oyster.
Are morning markets more common than night markets in Japan?
Did you check the walls of the banana stand for extra cash?
Ryotero singing the mario tune was a boomer in his natural habitat
The amount of wholesome vibes this video gives off is substantial
£10.37p
i would to travel
I literally gasped a the steam coming off the gyoza when Ryotaro pulled it out of the bowl. I would kill for those right now.
I feel sorry for you. Being forced to team up to that douchebag to get views.. He's a horrible human being.
I love those grills! So fun to do with family.
Chris England is addicted to chicken confirmed.
Ryotaro seems to be setting up his own t-shirt line
Their friendship is everything
Living in Japan would be so difficult because I love fruit and consume a lot of fruit and it seems every one that is ever produced in Japan has to be specialized, blessed by the gods, gold encrusted, and extortionately priced. What ever happened to a plain old apple 🍎
You have the best channel on YouTube Chris 😁
Don't be cheap. 2000 is stuff all
That's quite a meal for 20 bucks!
If you stop it at 7:00 you can briefly see Ryotaro in his true form.
Ryotaro is getting better i see. Love your work
The western in him cant say no to sweets in the morning it seems
You must first feel the seaweed....to become the seaweed
chris is better fat, hes so hot and thicc af
Did I hear a Fuuuuyoooooh!!! at 4:40 ? XD
Sure is kind of Ryotaro to help this small channel out.
Man and shiba in the background 8:43
Love how descriptive Chris is 😂 " this garlic chicken - tastes like garlic... With an undertone of garlic"
I can’t wait to see all the react videos
Ok so, your video is not showing up at my subscription feed AT ALL. I saw you posted a video and even went back to check and it's just not there. Something's very wrong.
man it's so cool Ryotaro got to guest star in this vid, hopefully it will convince his fans to check out more chris broad content.
I think your japanese friend has better tastes than you, no offense XD
lets see what you can get with 2000 yen in the sea food market. in wuhan
There is a good German term for "umami" : "herzhaft" ('hearty', but actually 'savoury'). A "herzhaftes Frühstück" (savoury breakfast) describes a breakfast with all the good stuff: cheese, bacon, meat, tried tomatoes. All the common ingredients and dishes that have glutamic acid.
I thought Chris was just scoring the banana as compared to his personal standards for choco bananas, not out of everything they could possibly eat at the market lol.
I describe Umami as when something tastes so good,  it makes you say "oooo mommy, that's good."
Would Ryotaro ridicule me for eating the fresh coffee ice cream I had at the Hakodate Morning Market? Because I'd eat that chocobanana for sure.  Also gyudon plz.
At that point your are a food channel honey
I love seeing Chris & his friends. Ryotaro is lovely.
I have been waiting for this, also, it is good to see Ryotaro again in the show
The girl in 8:20 caught my beautiful eyes.
God, all of that people packed in there in the market during a pandemic and you wonder why it is not over yet. Unless they recorded this in 2019 or something, there really should be way more restrictions still.
All looks so good...
over here for 1500 yen you can pretty much grill and eat as much as three to four times the amount of seafood you got there
Great video! A chocolate banana does sound pretty good!
corona needs to blow over so I can visit japan again!
Umami is *very* easy to explain: Monosodium glutamate. Which happens to be a sodium salt of an amino acid.
I want a chocobanana :>
who else saw the dog on the old guy in the wheelchair?
i love the guest. hes a classic guy
Damn looks good! I would taket that mixed plate and 3 bowls and be extremely full!!
Gahd, I miss morning food markets in general.
An Englishman complaining about a burned barbequed sausage. You've changed Chris
Hi
Might reconsider the thumbnail..looks like you're urgently in need of a toilet.....
Do you think it is better to take classes to learn Japanese.
Kimchi is Korean Food...obiously
Watching this before breakfast is a horrible idea. I am hungry
Maru de... Sweets expert vs salty expert
Sweet is your taste receptor reacting to food with Carbs/Sugar Bitter is your taste receptor reacting to the presence of poison/medicine/alkali? Salt is your taste receptor reacting to the presence of sodium. Spicy isn't really considered as something that reacts to taste receptor but rather pain receptor That leaves Umami as a receptor for food containing protein.  (source:paraphrased from Sushi and Beyond)
I know you love to point out your guests English ability during your videos and I think we'd all LOVE to see you do a whole video entirely in Japanese with Ryotoro and Natsuki pointing out your abilities as a way of "getting back", with English subs of course lol
8:43 the cousin of Dogecoin.
Goes to a street food market.. gets fried chicken. Why am I not surprised XD
That Ryotaro fellow trying so hard to be a funny guy ruined it for me. I'm out.
“Rawr” -Ryotaro 2021
@2:26  From now on, I'm splitting my chopsticks like that. Tekkers.
20$ per person with all of that quite great and you can share most of them too
Ryoutaro is precious. Protect him at all costs.
Would enjoy videos of you going to Nintendo World and a NPB game, with AIJ regular guest stars, and giving us your impressions.
1:17 OMG THOSE PUPPIES IN THE BAG
i knew Riottoro was a furry *rawr* *owo*
How did I know you’d be eating friend chicken in this vid? xD
Sendai? Date Masamune territory? not sure if i got that right...
that milk looked delicious
I'm definitely visiting this place!! I have been saving all quarantine and hopefully in the next 1-2 years I can go!!
That banana must have been really good if it was a 9!!
Where is animeman
Choco-Banana for the truly cultured!
Umami is just savory pretty much
The banana is expensive though
i am glad there is a new video i really missed Chris and his humor also i love every video were Ryotaro  and Chris are together
Chris sings: Big yellow joint big yellow joint, I'll meet you down at the big yellow joint.
drove  myself  crazy   cuz  i love  your  channel  bro.
Please never stop making videos Chris! You are so talented, funny & a pleasure to watch. Your videos are always entertaining and informative. Thank you!!!
i don't know if Chris eats this little, or is it because of Ryotaro
Choco banana **picks strawberry*
Chris, I watched your video about getting a work visa to move to japan, and I am extremely interested to know more details on this subject. I believe it would make a great video too. Specifically pertaining to your transition from teaching English to what it is that you do now, (what visa a youtuber would need, artist visa? long term residency visa?). If you have the time to respond in any way I would be extremely grateful.
can you make more videos? and when's your 2 million subscriber special
tought it was a strawberry banana
Real Failure 🤣
Chris, you have the nicest friends! It must say something about you too
3:40 Ryotaro destroy everything lmao 🤣
Chicken banana !
Ryotaro if for every fun. But apparently comparing sushi and chocolate banana .... that's just crossing the line :)
Ryotaro finally felt japanese lmao
Dont patronize the chef chris!
Hey Chris what do you think of this guy’s adventure in Japan? https://youtube.com/watch?v=7eFgRxfTZPI&feature=share
For me not yet peasant
Is that famous reaction youtuber Ryotaro’s Japan?!?
TIL "umami" is an addiction. One I have absolutely no problem enabling.
This guy is more American than British. Starts off his day with a chocolate covered banana (with sprinkles, cant forget the sprinkles) and the second thing he eats is fried chicken. XD
I really wanted to see the silver-haired man eat the tuna gill. :'(
Konnichiwa from 🇺🇸 Yakitori 〜！食べたい🤤 I love it！
4:41 Uncle roger
I love japan ❤️ i want next day go to japan 😢🙇🏻‍♂️
This Ryotaro guy looks like a cool guy...
Chocolate banana...
Its 3 am here where im and im fucking hungry
I love chocobananna.
Hey I like your video it brightened my day.. and we also love this strange bald guy with you... We want to see more of the strange bald guy 😁😁👍🏻👍🏻
natsuki and ryotoro never in the same vlogs?
Looks delicious !! Thanks for sharing.   What’s the best thing to eat in Japan !?
That dumpling and kimchi looked great. I love eating shrimp just can't get enough sometimes.
Not very healthy, is it.
Chris's new name.. chocolate banana
I'd like to know what "tuna shit" tastes like.
I'd like to know what "tuna shit" tastes like.
That shiba on the lap of that dude at 8:44 was cute. Wholesome~
watching this while eating my own breakfast gives me depression
I love how the ad I got at the beginning of the video was Rachel and Jun showing off a snack box. It just fits with the video so well.
morning markets and night markets are great!
7:56 cute!!!
Can't wait to see some reaction videos by the Japanese
I'm drooling T.T
Ohhh gyoza and kimchi. That sounds amazing. 😩
you can get chocolate banana in costa rica too and im sure pretty muche else where in latino america
Vitamin nylon keeps me regular👍
15$ for a huge BBQ seafood platter???  in my country that would cost at least 90 bucks
I wanna see that a abroad cast go to super mario land
Chris appears to have placed a stealth pilot to his new series ‘Abroad in a Pan’ on his main channel. Again.  On a more biochemical note, umami is a mixture of glutamates and nucleotides, specifically the amino acid glutamic acid, along with inosinates, guanylates, and adenylates.
Chris reviewing all food around japan
I'd love to see a video about Japan's street desserts!
Wow- first time at a Japanese Farmer’s Market in Sendai and the first meal choice is something one could get a friggin’ carnival? Why not opt for deep fried butter or boiled trans-fat on a stick?   I WOULD ask if you were trying to be fatter, but the answer to that would be REALLY obvious. 🙄  Fatty fatty fat fat.
4:40 Someone's been watching Uncle Rodger. Fuiyoooo
Looks so peaceful❤️
i have no religion...I only know...*CHOCOBANANA*
Hi Chris when u gonna make a video on the best Japanese sake or whiskey? Greetings from down under 🇦🇺
Another place for me to visit. Thank you so much for this video
Given the budget, I would not waste money on the chocobanana, nor on the fried chicken either.  Instead, I would spend on food with high nutrition/satisfaction-to-price ratio.  The seafood for the grill was a good choice, and so were the noodle bowls.  No sushi, tempura, or other yaki dishes there?
Shiba!
"Underwhelming Japanese villain" 😂😂
Fucking low effort 'what food to eat' video.  Seriously?  Have you officially run out of ideas?
Dang those chocolate bananas looked good!
I'd love to know what kind of jacket  Ryotoro is wearing, it looks great :)
OMG Ryotaro is so funny! I like this dynamic
Love episodes like this. Thanks Chris... Addiction!
Ryotaro started it off right. I'd love a bowl of that stuff.
Stay there
Damn if I could get that plate of BBQ meats for 10-15 bucks I would be there every morning!
This knock off DQ around the corner of my house sold chocolate bananas for a dollar as a kid, and i had tons of them.
I’m so hungry right now Your killing me you evil evil man The more I watch the worst it gets
My mom calls video games "like a Mario " as well
This was a fun video!
Really was hoping you'd try the beef intestine soup!  Ryotaro seemed to enjoy it lol
Just finished all of Abroad in Japan's videos!
Chris your videos are always great!
That seafood platter looked good. Ditch the crap sausage and fire the chef though.
lmao, Ryotaro's "peasant!" to close the video. Perfect.
I make Gyoza every friday for by BF and i, and omg i never thought about boiling it and adding kimchi.. That sounds soo good!!! Thanks Chris for opening up my eyes.
u two together are just funny, love to watch u guys
omg who would pick chocolate banana for breakfast in Japan that's possibly the most boring and worst choice
Oh yeah, go Bananas!!!!!!!
8:44 DOGE!
Wow truly timeless, I miss that Japanese food and can't wait to get back!
Fried chicken rules, ok!!!!!!
I'm jealous of your friendship with ryotaro!
I hope you got something else
Going to have to add "very much not for peasants" to my everyday phrases lol
Chocobanana > everything else. Thats a fact and im tired of saying it is not...
*Chocobanana stocks rises by 1000%*
saw that this was another food video and was like "bet there's fried chicken"  was not disappointed.  and now i want chocobanana
You get a thumbs up for Ryotaro stunning rendition of Mario while balancing the bowls of soup.
チョコレート・バナナって、ブタの餌じゃないの？
Really weird to see such a crowded market over there, knowing most of Europe is pretty much in lockdown...
why do you make fun of the way he talks?
Please do more street food Chris!!!
Not gonna lie, that chocobanana actually looks yummy. Sometimes chocolate covered bananas are hella frozen but that looks nice and fresh and yummy. I’d probably go for that as my first option as well haha.
If only they had chicken covered banana. Chris would save like 500 yen and be set for the day 🤔
He got $40 worth of seasfod for $15. and that dumpling dish looked delightful. Ryotaru has the better food tastes. also I am biased because I hate bananas
家から近い笑
In all fairness the Chocobananas are great at Japanese markets. With 2000 yen up your sleeve you could have gotten one with each dipped flavor and still gotten some other non-chocobanana dishes
I'm getting fatter the more I watch you eat. What's your secret, how are you so slim?
Chocobanana for the win!
"You get all your vitamin B12, your Zinc, your Copper...Nylon" absolutely killed me😂😂
Not just a chocolate banana... But a pink chocolate banana. Lol your just to cute dude 😂
1:37 made me giggle lol
Eventually all will converge and Abroad in Japan will become Japanese television where all they do is eat and compliment the food.
So do you feel the seaweed kicking in, is it strong stuff? 🤣
I'm eating pizza right now and my mouth is literally watering watching this.
I like Japanese food! Thank you for sharing my friend. I enjoyed watching it until the end. I hope you have a happy week😄👍
I love how Chris does nothing but poke fun at ryotoro the entire time lol
I see you still can't slurp noodles
Sonny gonna pimp slap you... jokes
Love having you both in the video
I would most definitely have had a chocolate banana!
Well, we can clearly see that 20$ doesn't buy good taste.
Next time look at Ryotaro in the eyes while eating the banana.
MSG = powdered umami
YOU WENT TO A JAPANESE MORNING MARKET AND HAD A CHOCO BANANA.
The banana is misshapen and Ryotoro is holding it against me.   Show the police lady on the doll where the bad man touched you.
8:39 Copyright Strike from Nintendo incoming! :D
Don't care either way about the Choco-nana, but not gonna lie, I'd have burned all $20 at that karaage booth. (but the gyudon looked good too)
I stand with Chris. We mexicans love chocobanana aswell. ❤️🇲🇽🍌
Explaining umami is like explaining how sweet tastes
wowoowowowowoow
well its better then a chocolate pickle.
I love chocolate banana's milk chocolate though 😋 👍👍👋👋
you can see how many takes it took for them to do the outro. the strawberry milk was full when they started filming it :3
#48 ON TRENDING
1:16 the doggos at the right are so cuteeee
The title: how much does $20 get you (2000 yen)?  Proceeds to spend 5400 yen
Too much meat.
Karaage, not kariage
"Overwhelming Japanese villain" 😂
Shame, Chris is like an american, eating crap...chocobanana !!!!.....and then.... I don't know why I'm fat !!! Time for another Journey across Japan....🤣
Sense of deja-vu
5:29 me too Ryotaro gotta eat it while it's still hot
" W e l l  d o n e " - Ryotaro, to charred sausage
i'm vegan
Teraoka Gyoza.. best gyoza i ever had! (was in Bangkok thou)
Hey Chris! Super nintendo world just opened this month  in universal studios Osaka .  How about a visit? Would be really fun I think
you can never go wrong with chocolate banana.
https://youtu.be/N-TRZZihVFo   👀👀👀👀😍
Haha, missed the Chris & Rissottoro dynamic <3
Nice to see businesses open, UK government doesn't have a clue.
Love Japan when i visited! Such good food and culture
Watch Earthlings documentary to see the suffering animals go through for meat, dairy, eggs. They dont want to die. They dont deserve to die.
Like a boss? No.  LIKE A MARIO!
I'm so glad I just eat before watching your video. What I like in Japan cusine is all the meaty/fish flavors (umami) what here in our country what is Czech Republic what is actualy right in middle of Europe, you can't just experience. So ... lot of envy here :) But even here you can get chocolate banana dude ... not cool.
"Exactly" - Ryotaro
I always wonder how Different Japanese food taste different from the one we have in America
Is Ryotaro Japan's only native born cockney barrow boy? That chocolate banana was really disappointing though especailly after the dumplings and kimchi.
amino acid lol
I went to a market in Okayama in the industrial area and had spectacular chirashizushi. The place was almost closed when we got there at noon-ish.
Oh boy that made me so hungry! If I ever go to Japan I would absolutely love to taste all of that, even though I know I wouldn't be able to order anything because I don't know Japanese
I'd love to have a fiendshiip (NOT spelled wrong) like you two have. Seems like you guys would be almost constantly laughing.
Omg Ryotaro’s sassy meat walk 😂
Awesome as always 💖
I plan on traveling Japan for a few months on a budget of less than $50 a day. This video has been very helpful to me. Thanks Chris!
There's always money in the Banana stand
And this is why your a thicc boy Chris. Although I probably would have done the same.
2:26 “that is not how Japanese people open the chopstick” content right there
whats with corona ?
What were the grilled tuna gills like?
I’m a simple man I see Ryotaro in the thumbnailI I like
Is it just me or has Chris reverse aged a bit?
great work!
4:21 me going number two while watching this video
Dogecoin
if it were me I would have not eaten that shit show of a barbique but those bowls well I would happily eat those
That is too expensive, so funny how the lady gave like a few clamps thats sad.
5:29 XD
8:44 SHIBA DOGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"Nylon" 😂😂
CHRIS I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. I LOVE your choice of Music. It fits the videos sooo good. Great job 👍🏼
Absolutely love your videos! I think I’m going to have to spend a couple of years in Japan (when travel is allowed!) to be able to see all the things I’ve added to my list from your videos.
is there alternatives to cow's milk in japan like soy or nut milk?
Chris bhai aap patle ho gaye ho
Chris seems to be fond of food nowadays...
That's a really luxurious breakfast to have in the morning and I would pick Ryotaro's choice over Chris's lol 😆
Ryotaro!
keep this fresh content going!! HAI!
The beef bowl sounded delicious but trying a chocolate banana would be super fun also!
I love this so much
1:44 Ryotaro reminds me of Squidward. 👀
The Iconic "Ahhhh" used in every beginning of the phrase in all the videos he made.🤣🤣🤣By the way "click" NOICE
I hate the white guy
Thought Japan was under lockdown. Only Tokyo?
Ryotaro and Dave, my two favourite brothers
In many countries, $ 20 is 8 servings for a good breakfast, or 10 servings for a decent breakfast, or 20 servings for an OK breakfast, or 40 servings for a hearty meal to fill a working class stomach. In Japan, you expect freshness and good flavour. How about you in UK? US? China? UEA? Africa? Tell me interesting story. A link would be good.
YOUR REALLY TEASING ME CHRIS , IM HUNGRY NOW
IMPORTANT TIMESTAMP!!          8:42 doge
How lovely! I hope to visit one day.
The way Ryotaro looks at 10:00 makes me melt. Poor man just wanted daddy’s approval
10/10 would also get a chocolate banana.
Nobody: Weebs:👁💧👅💧👁
do they have any vegetarian options? haha. great video!
4:56 When my friend gives me thc edibles without me knowing
Ryotaro was as astounded as myself, when Chris rated the Chicken lower than the Banana :D :D :D
well, considering the options limited to me this time of the morning... i suppose it's time for some fried chicken (frozen).... I really wanted some steamed dumplings after watching this tho.
To early to eat at 7 o' clock  in the morning!... And that was not breakfast, that was at least a lunch and a half... For each!  There didn't seem to be much chocolate on that chocobanana...
I didn’t see this video on my feet until now. YouTube wtf
I bet Chris feels at home in the overcast skies
You know, you don't have to advertise you';re British.  We already know it.
He does look like a villain...Not sure about the Japanese part though.
うまみって何？→amino acid  っていう的確すぎるけど絶対に求められてない答えマジで笑った
These two would make such a beautiful couple, together UwU
Ah yes, the fried chicken connoisseur is back
Amazing 🍽️$20 🍽️
Had a Strong Zero Ad before this video. Hmmm
The whimsical "Always Sunny" always does it for me.
In Switzerland you get two "Döner" if you're lucky
3:18 nylon 😂😂
Huh...never thought about eating gills but fins are delicious grilled or deep fried as a salty snack so wouldn't mind trying. Would have thought the gills were mainly used for stock though...
Tasty shoku....
Psychiatrist: Birdtaro is in not real he can't hurt you Birdtaro: 8:43
a place to grill stuff in the morning market???? even my country doesnt have that. i underestimatef japan
"Underwhelming Japanese Villain"
The stimulating polo apically reproduce because wrench consistently arrive since a diligent aries. descriptive, unbiased sugar
Thank you for having the names of the dishes spelled out. It’s very helpful for retaining info. I had never heard of “burdock.” This video was not a waste of my time! A+
Makes me so hungry to watch these videos! Keep up the great work!
To be honest I would love to see Risottoro's kitchen!
Did Ryotarou said PEASANT!!! at the end there XD
For 20$ i can buy the breakfast of a whole week 😂😂😅 japan is expensive af
The barbeque platter is quite value for money, a pity it got burnt. That's why I don't cook! XD
I fear that Chris would gain some weight again.
Risottoro!
wow Chris !よくできました. i dont know what you've done with Ryotaro but  his english is better than in the previous videos. yoku dekimashita.hope i can visit japan once in my life after the pandemic. Canada is far.
Karaage and Beef bowl for the win!
Dammit, what's good about this pandemic is to be stuck in the right country (with a job).
Meanwhile I’m sat here eating a bowl of cereal that cost 20p, or about 20 yen.
I'm getting hungry...
Ryotoro maybe funny but Ryotoro will never be Natsuki funny.
What is umami? Try some Marmite.
Goddamn i miss Japan!
your videos put me in such a good mood!
Waiting for Japanese YouTubers reaction for this video 🤣
I cant even leave my house and your eating out of same bowl.
I had to watch the video in several parts because the food looked soooo delicious and I became hungry really quickly
Am I the only one that genuinely gets anxiety when Ryotero says Good morning in his evil voice? :scream:
What do you do with the wooden tray?
The food is all burned Ryotaro: *"Again, it's called well done"*
8:43 doge spotted
Riotoro.
They sell chocolate covered fruit (all kinds) at the christmas markets here in Germany every year. ❤️🤤
Being a big fish-eater, I prefer Ryotoro's choices, but everything looks great. You two also compliment each other in such a great way because you have such different food preferences and are able to present variety of food choices.
It's too short!
I feel like Ryotaro realises from Chris he’s said something that doesn’t make sense but has no clue what it was and but tries his best to act like he does
Can’t wait to react to this.
Hey mate. Whole video on fancy perfect japanese desserts pls :)
There is nothing wrong with chocolate bananas, they are delicious!
Watching this in the morning here wishing we had a morning market.
Ryotoro has really become quite the good show host, you really notice that he has his own youtube channel now!
Eating my breakfast whilst watching you eat yours. I do need me some chocobanana to complete the meal though..
My two years in Japan is almost up so I headed off to Sendai to kickstart my Tohoku winter getaway. Stayed in Sendai for four nights last week, and not gonna lie, I was kinda hoping to bump into you. That sadly didn't happen, but I still went to Tsukansan for the gyutan and Zao Onsen to fulfill my winter wonderland dreams (I was born and raised in a country with no snow). Take care always, Chris! Keep up the great content!
Umami = MSG 😅
I don't understand the effort beyond 720p for Chris, but 5K is too damn low for national treasure Ryotaro
Basically, Japanese street food is more expensive than regular shops because most of the visitors to the stalls are tourists.
I love Yuriage port! 閖上港！
I have subscribed after watching your BK meal on shamanders channel..Have to say, I find her videos mostly boring but I love yours! Win win
Is Japan in lockdown?
Press F in the comment section for the camera man not getting to eat those food.
Dear Chris Please make videos daily or I die of lack of Abroad. Sincerely
Ryotaro starts singing the mario theme song.  Youtube copyright laws: "Yeah go on. I dare you."
yuriage does that mean its the place for lesbian couples or is it just a name? XD
Fruit and veg underrated
bacon sarni for my breakfast, but I would give some of this a go, maybe not the tuna steak
banana > chicken, obviously
Is the seafood really that fresh when most of the water around Japan is polluted after the fukushima disaster?
Ryotaro is everything.
Loved every moment guys.😁
Ah yet another instalment of my favourite show - getting fatter with Chris Broad.  I’m kidding, but I love your channel.
How I miss markets! Tired of this stupid luck down
Mate, please please please don't ever give up on this. I love you and your friends and I could watch all your episodes for the rest of my life.. If I need to. Kidding of course! Love you Chris and keep it going.
Umami- the way Brits love Marmite.
Woooo this got viral
I just came here for all the nutritional advice comments 😻
chris, this japanese guy is so cool :D
Yes as you can see Americans aren't the only ones eating sugar foods for breakfast.
8:42 - Who cares about the food when you have a cute Shiba-Inu in the background?!?!   ♡＾▽＾♡
Tuna shit.... Sounds about right :)
Short sleeves?
You had me at tuna, but lost me at gill.
Wow, incredbile how much can be bought for just 2000 Yen! And all fresh on top of that. Are the prices so low because the average income or is food generally that much cheaper on such markets?
I always make the mistake of watching these food based videos on an empty stomach. >_<
That barbecue platter for 1000 yen look good. Chocobanana is just too tempting. I'd pick that too out of the 2000 yen.
Why do you always quote prices in US dollars? English pounds as well please.
I want to try those fish on a stick things. You always see them in anime. So curious how it tastes irl.
Hey, found you in the trending page in the US, pretty good, Chris!  Always a good day when Chris and Risottaro are in my feed.  :)
@abroadinjapan @Sharmeleon We just watched Sharla’s video of you sitting down to eat the plant burger, we both said “wow, Chris has lost weight!” And then we watched this and saw you standing up next to りょたろさん eating fried chicken...     keep making amazing videos mate, ありがとうございました、そして、ごめんなさい。
The moral of the story is to visit a Japanese morning fish market if you're broke and hungry huh? Seriously, that towering kimchi boiled gyoza amazingness just makes me wanna get up and visit Japan
After so much food you both will need journey across japan #2
Ryotato: Actually pick a decent food that will fill you up. Chris: CHOCOLATE BANANA!
Ryotaro in the ramen kingdom
Suigyoza is literally like Russian Pelmeni, wow
chrids borag
Lol this was a fun episode........  kinda want a choco banana now.
Today I learned: one of my turn ons is Ryotaro biting on chopsticks to open them. Okay then.
Grilling your own food there seems kinda fun honestly
Am I the only one seeing the irony that this video is just Japanese television for westerners?
"What you can get and what I can get, and he's gonna get some shit" - Ryotaro 2021
I think the "tuna gill" is tuna collar?? or is it truly the gill?
As per usual, I love the Chris and Ryotaro videos (especially the morning market ones hahah) comedic, informative, and everything looks delicious!
This was a great vid. I am glad these two are making bids again like the ole good days
see you at school tomorrow chris senpai
I never knew there was something called 5k(2880p) till now. Chris how fast is your net and what camera do you use?
Ryotaro : *BURNS THE SAUSAGE TO ASHES* also Ryotaro : It's called WELL-DONE🗿
Fantastic video as always Chris! You yet again brought a smile to my face with your incredibly sarcastic humour and fantastic film-making. A combination literally made in heaven  Also 2:08 BuzzFeed Worth It would like to know your location
Um chocobanana with sprinkles....👍🙂
👍
But how was the Tuna Gill? - curious Aussie
You know they're frenemies when he doesn't even tag Ryotaro's YT page in the description...
The video that Ryotaro got copy striked with his Mario song XD
Tuna.......Tuna Shit
I love how Chris had to stop eating and had a double-take at the judge comment.
8:42 A doge.
Ryotaro looks and talks like Herman li
Next go to Japanese massage parlour and see what 20 dollars gets you .
this fake british accent guy is annoying
I feel healthier by only watching Japanese food 😏😊
Jesus is coming back soon everybody! Rejoice to believers! To those reading this comment please turn to him, and repent for your sins! Jesus and I love you! ❤️💕You do not want to be here for the great tribulation after the rapture of the church! Please get a relationship with Jesus right now! There is not much time left! Everything is not right! This ship is sinking and you need to get on the lifeboat right now! Jesus (God) loves you so much that he died for you so that you may be saved!
8:42 DOGEEEEEE!!!
Gin san!!
Chris starting with chocolate banana and ending it with strawberry milk. I didn't know he had a thing for sweets.
Can one buy you for 2k yen?
Cant wait till I can travel .never been out of the usa and am excited to soon be able to visit so many places and try the food .Italy is my first stop .
Ummm..... that hot smoking Gyoza tho
Typical Westerner...Sweets on the first meal of the day.
You’re British do the exchange rate in pounds smh
I love costal fish markets .fresh off the boat is the best .
Bananas provide your daily intake of nylon according to Chris.
The Ryotaro dance in the I to. priceless.
Me, just noticing this was posted recently and not a year ago or something:
0:43 IM DEAD
Does anyone know if it's more common to eat mild and plain food or spicy and savory for breakfast in Japan? It feels like people of Japan don't differentiate breakfast food from lunch or dinner type of food,  is that accurate? Garlic for breakfast seems very intense.
$2.5 for a banana?🤯
When I was in Paris for a few days, I had pizza one night.  When visiting Korea, I got loaded cheese fries.  ... doesn't matter where you are. Sometimes you want weird shit. Let the man have his chocolate banana.
I want to eat everything in this video, except the Chocolate Banana.
Sometimes i dont know if Chris being serious/sarcastic, especially with Ryotaro 😅
Got a camera upgrade? 5k?
Sooooo I visit a shop that has Mexican snacks (I’m Mexican) and choconana is definitely a thing lol
In the film "jiro dreams of sushi" they best describie Umami.
You went to a Japanese market and had a choco banana 🤬
Thanks again. Great watch.
That's a steal for that tuna collar. They left a lot a meat on it still too.
I want to try the strawberry milk 🤤
I bet you’re watching this video with your legs crossed 😂💖
@Abroad in Japan Chris you and Ryototoro's collaborations Rock. It stuck, sorry RJ. :-)
Who you think you're fooling Chris, chocobanana BEFORE karaage? Are those karaage flavored chocobananas? xD
Really love Japan. Wish to travel there again once the pandemic is over 😋
I want one of everything. So good.
Chris dressed fancier trying a Burger King than a fancy choco banana
Kinda (completely) unrelated to this vid but I got home and it’s -21°c out and I wanted something like Chris’s sweet warm sarcasm to heat my cup noodle but somehow I clicked on some idiotic channel with guys named “ratchet and links jerkey” or wtf ever. 12 minutes of settings adjustments and I’m back where I belong👍
Grill Ryotaro next time he burns your food
Why on Earth did I watch this past midnight on an empty stomach?
I was actually eating Karaage Chicken while watching this. Mine was good, but that looks better!
I got a chocolate banana too :P
Next time do $20 for lunch and dinner
It's always a good day when Chris drops a new video.
I really want that milk and a chocolate banana.... Japanese cuisine is so exotic.
as an american that doesn't know the definition of portion control, can you guys please go ham the next time you go to the market and just eat to your heart's content on an unlimited budget?
Chris and his sidekick...
It all looks delicious but gott DAYUM that's a lot of food for two knuckleheads.
"Underwhelming Japanese Villain"
"very umami flavor"  - Chris
I mean guys, look at the ground!!!!! It is soooooo cleeaaaaaannnnnnn. You'd have to really search for litters to actually find one and it would be hard.  Wish more public places can be like this.
I hope he gives you as much shit about your japanese as you do about his English, given that you don't speak it properly yourself 😄
This video is making me Hungry af.
More food videos !!
No matter what country I found them in, I'd always pick the Choco Banana. But also that Gyudon looks delish!
Umami = MSG. Simple.
Someone take me to Japan already
"Do You Feel The Seaweed?"   - Ryotaro, Famous Japanese Philosopher
1:17 PUPPIES IN A POUCH I REPEAT PUPPIES IN A POUCH
I love sweets. I would have gone for the chocolate banana too.
0:40 "Without a doubt the world's worst chef" I think I just heard Gordon Ramsay yelling in the distance "IT'S RAAAWWWWWWWW"
What a luxury, ultrafresh seafood for breakfast. I'm grateful for frozen fish & squid soup today. Btw, fyi, Umami in bahasa Indonesia = Gurih
Umami- it melts in your mouth.
Ryotaro and Chris in this video accurately depict my 2 tastes in food. It's either good food or trash. There is no in between.
Why are there no seagulls stealing food at the tables at that market?
Dude you got on Trending, congrats!
Hi Chris!! ❤️
when i was in oxford england there was a market near oxford castle, maybe Gloucester green market or something like that but anyway there was a japanese food stall and they had the best fried prawn and gyoza dumplings, and it was super cheap and amazing. I would get some food and go sit on some steps at the nearby buildings.
WHYYY NOW I WANT CHOCOLATE BANANA
Mouth watering
Chris eats like a kid lol
LOL  @ 1:19 those 2 puppies.
Umami is basically MSG.
These videos make me laugh so much
There’s a reason Japanese food is my favorite
GILL!!!
I think you went a little too hard on Riotoro in this one. For the first time I feel bad for him.
Risotorro finessed you! Motsunabe is bloody fucking delicious, I had it in Fukuoka !! Thanks for the video you two are the most entertaining duo on this channel!! haha
Those choco bananas... Damn man, they looked amazing.
Woah, it's in 5K.
oh my god i thought u were joking about Ryotaro being a sucky chef...but...that sausage....oh no..
Now i want a beef bowl
Chocolate banana for breakfast. And he picked the neon pink one at that.
Great video.  I loved it.
He's officially one of us now
I always enjoy the shows that feature both of them together, they make a good team.
So cool Rachel n June were the commercial for ur video
Chris and Ryotaro are the best frenemies I've ever seen.
Next time visit maid cafe.
YOO 5K? Did you record in the s1h's 6k mode for this one? Also please update your description for your equipments lol.
..so hungry..time to find a ramen
Your channel condemned my husband to cooking us Japanese food again.
I have NEVER seen a street food place *SO F*CKING CLEAN* O_o
Wouldn't be a Chris Broad video without fried chicken.  🤣
🤤❤️👌
Great video!
8:09 ryotaro made that woman drop her money smart ass villain
No plant based burgers and Cyborg attack pigeons at the market?
Keep it up !
Oh my gosh the suigyoza looks AMAZING
2:51 cute shiba
Why's there a Canadian flag at 1:06? Honestly looks like a Neighbourhood here in Vancouver called Steveston which ironically was one of the japanese settlements in the region.
That's it! You guys are like Mario and Luigi!
You’ll get a strike due to Ryotato’s amazing Mario performance.
😄
8:18 mbaknya cantik ehe
Hi
wonder how many of Chris's videos is him just eating
I really wish the US had these markets. I really enjoyed them when I visited Tokyo. Karaage was my favorite.
Hey, some of us like well done sausages, maybe darker than ryotaro made them 👀. I’m very impressed with everything you can buy for 20 bucks, and fresh!! Idea 💡: would you, Sharla, and Ryotaro ever consider being tour guides? Make it a business for your subscribers? That’d be awesome!
Man the camera used for for this video is producing some really really good shots!
7:33 yea because your banana was pink
Hey stop bullying each other so much D:
The way the Japanese can make artificial models of the food on offer is a constant source (sauce?) of amazement to me. The realism is outstanding, you really get what you see.
Ok, get the chocobanana....but the pink one mate?
0:28 lol she's like "that's too much" oh nvm it's free
Garlic oil chicken perfect.
ARE YOU EFFING KIDDING ME!!!!!! how is that is not at least 20 mins of footage of the guy carrying 2 puppies on his messenger bag @ 1:17 in the video? I have so many questions!!! are they just strolling? are they having something to eat too? what are their names? so miffed !! missed opportunity!
That umimi flavor is from msg which you can actually buy online, it's not as bad as everyone says and can help you lower your sodium intake
安くね！？
"Chicken and Banana!"
Chris reminds me of a soba noodle
Chris I’ve already watched all your journey across Japan videos and now I’m lonely. Is there a chance you would do another one?🥺
Another delectable video!!  Always love the friendly banter between Chris and Ryotaro!
0:43 That's gif material right there.
Also, why are you both dressed the same like a couple 😆
You have matching outfits lol Twins.
no social distancing.. that brings good memories
Thanks for this. I live in Tokyo with my wife right now but we plan to move back to her home town Minamisoma within the next few years, so i hope this still exists!
Quick question. Is there a way to order Akihabara figurines from the states? The site is all in Japanese so I have no idea what says what. Their quality is leagues above the shit produced here in the states.
another great video, well done
Are u Youtuber?
In which Chris goes to a traditional Japanese market and eats like an American at a carnival.
Isn't Umami just MSG?
I’ve hit an extreme low with depression and my life crumbling down all around me. Your videos help me to smile and bring back hope that I can one day be okay again.
Being as I am about to be abroad in Japan in a few months for a couple years, I really ought to be watching this channel.
8:44 thank me later
He said dodgy bbq i heard doge bbq lol
easy YouTube video 101  food trip with rissotoro, insult each other, film on camera, all actual effort goes into post production. make click-bait thumbnail.
Great episode
How much to rent ryotaro for my chef for a day?
Umami flavour: put salt on cherry tomato, and eat it
Seems like a good thing for families to do every month or so. To answer you question dumpling bowl if i was by myself; the bbq with strawberry milk for everyone if i was with people.
I really enjoyed this video...I was gonna say tho, if you keep saying that Ryotoro is a bad cook, he may insist You cook next time 😆😉😎
Underwhelming Japanese Villain cooking BBQ for a Overwhelming UK Hero lol
I love how Chris is always in a better mood in videos about food
Really love the chemistry between Chris and Ryotaro. It's almost like Watson and Holmes kind of vibe. Except with them it's more like Watson and Japanese Watson.
duuuude eat what you want lol. next time get a chocolate covered banana in a crepe! this first time i went to japan, I caught so much shit for playing metal games. "you went to japan and did that??" yes. i did. lol its a huge part of the social culture lol and i think they are fun AF lol. but these are the people that think that hello kitty is Japanese and that everywhere in japan is "Tokyo".  they could be in Fukuoka and make a social media post like "we're here in southern Tokyo" haha #weebsarestupid
❤ Ryotaro
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Is this a reupload? I remember watching something similar before Edit: nvm, the one that I remembered was in Aomori, this one is in Sendai
I like Ryotaro san so much. Judging from his way of talking in Japanese, I'm sure he is a thoughtful and kind man. Btw weren't you cold wearing short sleeves?😂
Abroad in Japan on my birthday, love it!
1:18 the man in the lower right corner wearing brown jacket, he carried two dogs in his pouch didn't he? so sweet. or am i imagining things😅😂
3:11 I understand Ryotaro's disappointment. Where I live that thing is worth no more than 30 yen
Chris = kid appetite Ryotaro = typical adult taste
US could never
Chick at 7:58
Mmm amino acid
You’re  near the  Pacific Ocean and you ordered banana and chicken.   He.  He.   He
I love that Chris "hates" him, but their friendship seems so genuine! I really enjoy your dynamic!!
Facebook fact checkers are Chinese and they are in league with the Chinese Communistic party — corrupt and biased — https://www.truthccn.org/2021/01/31/facebook-fact-checker-funded-by-chinese-money-through-tiktok/ .
I wonder how chocobanana idea works in other countries as a street food. That's actually a fantastic idea for my country where obese is king. And eating banana is healthy. I support that idea.
Five basic tastes are sour, sweet, bitter, spicy, and salty. Umami is something on top of the fives, is harder than the fives to accomplish.
When you are using money, you have the right like judge!!???? What does it mean lol this dude is interestingly mysterious 😂 I like him very much tho❤️
You guys must've been full to bursting by the end of this. The "beef intestine" soup actually isn't particularly strange it sounds a lot like a Mexican dish I am familiar with called Menudo though their version seems potentially far less seasoned and less smelly.
I love how slim Dave in japan looks now he must be working out.
0:07 - He went to Hell for breakfast.
japanese staple foods? no, *c h o c o b a n a n a*
But how was the bowl of intestines???
Risottoro has clearly emerged victorious on this day
Short sleeves in February?
Umami is the sound of one hand clapping. If that was a taste. Or anything with glutamates, like Marmite and Parma Ham. Oh, and the chocobanana was a winner, though probably best after starting with the garlic chicken. OK, or one chocbanana each side of the garlic chicken.
I believe he's right. When I think of choco banana  I think of Japan. Haven't seen it done anywhere else.
How was the tuna gill?
8:42 just a guy vibing with his shiba inu lol
I swear almost everyone of your videos are about eating well I guess you do what love right MR chris pig gherkins.
Another entertaining video.  Keep 'em coming!
Awesome video! Always fun to have *Rissotoro* along for the adventure!  I really like that there's some grills near the markets, eating it so fresh just the way you like it! .... I also would have tried the chocobanana... 😂
Now im hungry
I was super worried here for the copyright strike 8:39 😱🤣
What about the natto
Ryotaro singing mario is soooo kawaii >///<
that i good 20.00 goes pretty far...i dig it
0:11 that mans got moves 🕺
If Risottoro and Connor meet, they'd just be cruising on their horses, calling everyone peasant.
Chicken boy almost lost some street cred by rating a chocolate Banana higher than his beloved fried chicken! Good save there at the end, cred now restored! XD
I’m getting hungry while eating... I didn’t even know that was possible
That Chocolate Banana 🍌 Looks So Yummy!!!!!! 😄✌️✨💛
Another great video, keep them coming :)
After only 3 minutes in I knew already that the market has no beer to sell.
is it easy to visit japan now?
Their dynamic is great!
半袖寒くないですか！？
I really love the interplay between the tastes and personalities of Chris and Ryotaro. You guys could practically make a channel out of nothing but food videos, and I'd sub with the first one.
It’s funny that Chris keeps talking about chocolate banana when he bought a strawberry 🍌
Why USD???
Not gonna lie. I'd just spend all 2000 yen on a bigger box of that first dumpling kimchi, fuck that looked good. Why do i live here and no there? :(
All the dishes looked amazing to be honest, but I'm not sure if my 7am stomach will be happy to see them haha Personally I would go for BBQ set, but maybe buy veggies to go with it.
A...broad Chris in Japan.
Important question: is this market good for visitors who don't speak japanese?
That Shiba Inu with its owner on the wheelchair at 8:43 is kawaiii AF
Why $20 and not £15 :'(
Dont trust chris you will get fat, trust ryotaro his always right.
and here i am in my country. getting a shrimp skeleton for that price and people telling me how expensive japan is. no wonder his body takes up more and more screen space :*D
Not related to anything here, but is that a John Henric sweater that Chris had on?  I was literally wearing the exact same style and shade of that today
I didn't realise how badly I needed this video until I clicked
Ryotaro is my favorite man in the universe
8:44 DOGE
Who ever said Japan was expensive!
The food looks great but you two clowns are trying too hard to be funny. You come across as silly and childish. Don't try so hard to be personalities. Let the food do the talking.
"Something sweet and covered in sprinkles..." Me: dild.... Chris: choco Banana Me: of course 😅
DAMM 8K ok i see you
Imagine being able to leave your house, and having food outside, from a market 😭
Chris would make a great documentary presenter because of his sarcasm and self awareness
its almost 2 am in the morning and ill making fried chicken now, sadly i dont have a chocobanana =(
look yummy. interesting. like
Chris: All i want is the "Chocolate Banana"  Also Chris: Picks the strawberry one 🤣
I would have picked a chocco banana to be fair too.  Love these vids.
If anyone here ever goes go to Germany, they have nutella and banana crepes at stalls, and oh my god I'm addicted to them, they're so good. Way better than a banana with just chocolate drizzled over them.
There were 3 Doge's in this video
Please do more of these food videos. Also, please upload weekly,  (understanding that its hard due to pandemic) because I always look forward for your content. A big fan of your content!!!!!!!
Great, now I have to run to the store for some Amino Acid for dinner....
Japan, food, a Brit and Chris...whats not to love?
Literally just ate a sausage, "no, the beef intestine soup is for you"
Umami = MSG
Ryotoro and Natsuki should do a collab together...without chris of course😂
That dude at 1:16 with all the little dogs in the purse is my idol lmao
Is there sales tax in Japan? Or is the price it say exactly what u pay
Ryotaro's Kitchen vs Jun's Kitchen: The showdown of the century    Edited: Why there are so many likes?? It's just one phrase from Chris?
who else was watching this while sucking on a ketchup packet?
I thought those chocolate covered bananas were chocolate covered sausages for a min lol 😂
Brilliant video as always! But did anyone else see the guy carrying around the 2 dogs in the fanny-pack at 1:17???
4:40: Is it good? Uncle Roger in the background: FUYIOH! XD
Why is not CdawgVA with you? ;)
"it's called a well done" HAHA
Hes english is getting so perfect. I feel like my life is sad without him. <3
Ryotoro is a "Underwhelming Japanese Villain" while Chris Broad is a "Japanese Spy."
Did you ever find your evil twin "Dave in Japan?"
i love your channel but dont trying to hard. Just saying !
I think someone has been hanging out with Natsuki behind Chris' back 😅 I also now want a chocolate banana. Damn you.
I love your show, recently I've been binge watching previous episodes (as I subscribed just recently), I find it very useful as I'm planning to visit Japan soon. And YES, I MUST try chocolate banana!!! :)
When he said amino acid flavor he was describing soy sauce flavor!
Random question mate, you've been across the pond for quite a while now. Give us your best Japanese accent. Go on then 😝
Take a shot every time chocolate banana is said
Chris, you are too greedy about food! 😅 Let that poor man eat his breakfast.. 😘😘😘
Great video!!!!
Ryotaro is the start of the show. Thank you for the good work! Ostukare-chan
Both look so happy early in the morning! Even Chris ☺ Envy you!
Quite like this one video
This has made me very, very hungry...
Is your belly getting smaller or it's just the black shirt?
I do wish we got to see them eating the seafood BBQ stuff though haha!
I mean for 10 dollars that is a pretty good selection
All that fresh grilled seafood looks amazing.
Thanks for the kanji under these chris, cheers!
I could listen to chris say "chocolate banana" all day 😆
Where natsuke ???? He a much better co-host 😞
Alternative title: Middle age Japanese man try’s to act cool for 12 minutes.
This video is amazing because of 8:44 SHIBA behind of Ryotaro.
I can’t believe you gave up the motsu nabe!!
Chris needs to do an expensive Japanese fruit or vegetable video/series :)
Why is a british guy talking about DOLLARS
Was wondering if there is flea market in Japan and what can be found over there.
Why is the chocolate banana not on the thumbnail? Clearly the star of this video!
Anyone else get a bokksu ad that was rachel and jun and had to double check what channel they were watching?
I’m so glad I’m going to have dinner very soon. XD
For westerners trying to find umami: parmesan cheese.
risottoro is undeniably great content
日本語 字幕 お願いします！
8:42 min in i spy a doge ... must invent in dogecoin now
it always amazes me how much value japan puts on strawberries. they are so much money over there! i like strawberry flavor too, but it’s a whole other level there. in the USA they are not expensive at all, and are available all season. It’s like 3-5$ for a pack and they usually go uneaten .
My favourite villain Ryotaro back in the series ☺️
Well over done sausage
You can take the man out of England but his food choices remain
British man eating again with his side kick huh. 8:17 and the girl serving wearing hippy printed shirt is pretty
I just stuffed myself with enough meat as I could. Now for the first time I feel I should not watch the video because of the food. Maybe I'll come watch it tomorrow after my sleep
"whats better, fried chicken, or shrimp... I think we know the answer to that" that had me dying!!
Why are they dressed like a couple of homeless street magicians?
In the quiet words of Pete Donaldson: UMAI
Nice video, but I am with Risottoro this time. Dumplings with kimchi and grilled sea-foof vs. Banana and Chicken? C´mon, at least you could have tried to get a decent meal. ;)
Anyone living in Sendai, please tell me if the local seafood is still radioactive? Are they safe to eat? Thanks
Wow 5k
Wow Chris looks very healthy and good!! I'm so happy~~
There is nothing offal about that soup. A chocobanana!? You eat it!?
It's worth noting, that is a "kama" or "collar" of tuna not a gill lol. Often overlooked in western culture, it's a delectable fatty cut of most fish. Pretty typical to see it grilled.
God, I wish I was there so I could try everything eaten in this video.
Dammit, all this makes me really hate the fact  I had to cancel my flight this year to Japan.  Damn you Covid!
I want this umami! :)
Oooo mommy flavor.
Goes to a Japanese food stall. Gets a chocobanana. Ugh, Chris.
"RWAR" -RYOTARO 2021
Chris I love your food videos!
There's always money in the banana stand
It's OK Chris chocolate bananas are hard to deny when you come across them, I agree. I had a gyudon bowl 2 weeks ago at a local ramen shop and it was oishi! It looked identical to the one you ate here in this video. Also so crazy you described umami because I bought a japanese seasoning from my local grocery store and it's called "Umami". I just thought it had something to do with the word "umai" 😅 but now I know. Despite it having mushroom as one of the flavors (not s fan of mushrooms) it was a super tasty seasoning. It has celery, onion, garlic, etc.  Nice video! I always love Ryotaro's presence because of the back and forth commentary. Many laughs.  I miss the whole morning market thing since stupid Covid. It's certainly one of my favorite things to do and I think it's something I aim to do when I visit Japan!
chris u bastard i want more food videos theyre always brilliant!
Chocobanana is county fair favorite 🍌
If this YouTube thing doesn’t work out Chris you could get a job as a royal food tester for the queen.
Chris arrives specialist seafood maket gets dishes he could get from 7/11
Isn't Japan in a state if emergency? I thought there was a lockdown ?? Maybe wrong.
What was the last thing ryotaro says in the clip?  "peasant" ?
I spent 30$ on a shitty medium pizza yesterday
Chocostrawberries the luxury
i love those " lets go out and show some classic japanstuff " -videos. Simple but awesome!
It's an hour before I start cooking dinner.  I should not have watched this.  Now I'm hungry and inadequate!
what can Chris buy with $20  Risottoros life
Thumbnail changed?
Amino acid addiction - Ryotoro, 2021
Should I eat 2000 Yen's worth of karaage? No. Would I, though? Absolutely.
that chocobanana looks so damn good
I feel there is chemistry between Chris and Ryotaro ❤️❤️❤️
I love that the video’s like a documentary quality video mixed with a regular YouTube video
I’m tired of all the hate comments for Ryotaro!  Autism isn’t funny!! 😡🤬
What an amazing place!
No! No backsies on the choco-banana score. 🍌
There’s always money in the banana stand 💸💸
This is the kind of content that made me subscribe
I'm having pork belly covered in syrup and dark chocolate spread for breakfast!
We missed you!  The two of you have such a fun banter, agree?! All the food picked are our taste so it’s fun to watch!!
I am with you, chocolate banana would be first thing I would buy because of my sweet tooth then fired chicken after that I try the sea food.
Is japan still in a state of emergency or has it passed.?? 😯
This reminds me of the pulgas
The time in lockdown has clearly affected Ryottaro's english, he is starting to sound more like Natsuki in in his description of items. Love these local out-and-about morning market videos. My most watched one (next to the drive to see Natsuki) is the other morning market video from a few years back. Can I also add that while I;m not a world traveler, I've never encountered Chocobanana's outside of Japan before.
Pink chocobana looks amazing!
Ryotaro- 50 years old. Chris- 30 years old. Asians don’t raisin.
BABE WAKE UP ABROAD IN JAPAN UPLOADED A NEW VID
All I want in life is to find someone who looks at me the way Rissotoro looked at Chris at 5:12.
Does anyone have any idea when Japan plans to open their borders?
8:08 the shopkeeper would have turned the other way if it were some other country.
Even the so called chocobanan that Chris picked was least "choco" looking banana I've ever seen. If you're gonna go for chocobanana at least something that looks somewhat like a chocolate covered banana........... ;)
2000 yen spent on all chocobanana seems worth it
Hope you dont get demonitized by Nintendo :×
How don’t you get fat I don’t understand I gain weight only from watching????
Can always trust them to review food. Hungry.
That's my favorite kind of video - eating/traveling with ryotoro
Umami otherwise known as MSG in south east asia
I think the expression Ryotaro was looking for was "justice delicious"
8:43 doge
Risottorro: again, it's called well done 🤣
Bless the lady that dropped the change at 8:08  I felt that.
"Vitamin B12, zinc, copper, nylon." Wow he recalled all the nutritinal information of bananas
I don't know why but I like to see your stupid face for some reason.
Yeah in Asia we have a full course meal for breakfast 😂
Ah yes, I must top up on my Vitamin Nylon, thanks for the reminder! :D /(Great video as always guys!)
Me: I wonder how Chris can keep gaining weight when you have the worlds most beautiful seafood, a bounty of exquisitely cultivated fruit, and live in a country where walking is the norm.  Chris: CHOCOLATE AND FRIED CHICKEN FOR BREAKFAST
Me the entire time: omg stop talking it sounds too good 😰
Ryotaro is the foodie friend I would love to have
I don't know if I would've gone for the chocobanana, but that karage sure looked nice
CHOCOLATE BANANA!
英語の勉強になりました👍
A video p (or video series) about umami and the dishes or ingredients that define it could be fun
Good job always love your videos keep up the good work!!!
Chris and Ryotaro, together you are like two enthusiastic kids. Love it.
Umami is msg?
I’m a lil late, but about to enjoy this vid! Thanks!
Chocobanana or chicken one of the two would have to be my first meal.
I feel like their relationship is like Alan Partridge (Chris) and DJ Dave Clifton (Ryotaro).
Chris: "And now, I take my revenge on you for your reaction video!" Ryotoro: "What?" Chris: /shoving Ryotoro off the side of the pier into the water while Roundabout by YES plays
the Black Shirt Mafia
Girl in purple at 7:55 gorgeous af
chocolate banana is a typical food you can buy on a german christmas market haha. You can also buy chocolate grapes and strawberries 🙏🏻✨
Probably not much
Chocolate bananas, 9 out of 10?   That's bananas, Chris.
Choco bananas and other chocolate covered fruit always remind me of my childhood. In Germany we have "Kirmes" which are festivals similar to a fair, or matsuri. Those stands were always the first I went for. Don't blame you one bit. Choco bananas are a 9/10, no questions asked. Ryotaro can eat his intestines and gills. I love chocolate!
Need help in importing or exporting your products from the USA den us an email to OleaBrokers@gmail.com or visit www.OleaBrokers.com
I always find it interesting we default to dollars  And these two are not American at all I mean obviously it’s because 20 bucks is the easiest to conceptualize universal
"rwar"
I will not deny it, I do want chocobanana. And the luxury strawberry milk.
2:33 The Shiba Inu dog in the background is living the life
"Rawr xD" -Royotoro probably
RAWR
bro we all know that fried chicken will be showcased in this video.
01:12 parking lot shot: 100+ vehicles and all but like 17 of them are backed into their spots... and virtually all of them are perfectly aligned.  😯🤩 You probably overlook this simple beauty after seeing it everyday  😝
Hopefully Chris will read this! I’ve always wondered what sort of visa you use to be able to reside in Japan for so long and how to get such a thing! I’ve been very curious about moving to japan as of recently and would love to hear something back from you, or whoever has knowledge over this topic! Thank you in advance
8:44 Hachiko spotted !
5K OMG
Hmnm banana garlic and seaweed. Perfect Combo, Well done, Chris! Definetly can see the british in you now
Haha. I don't think there's a video out there where I haven't laughed at how AiJ and Ryo interact with each other. Pure comedy.
Risottoro is a joy in every video
Congrats on 2 million subscribers.
They have family for rent in Japan, it’s mind blowing how lonely people really are.
Chris seems to consistently be a total dick to Ryotaro in every video he's in. Why is that? He's constantly mocking and deriding poor Ryotaro!
Ryotaro I am so with you! Chocobanana with sprinkels when you have chichken karaage, are you mad, lad?
Chris went starting as LBH to major Youtuber, very impressed how this has grown over the years.
Right there with you about the chocobanana 😉
No, not 7am lunch again
Damn that looks good, money well spent
Ryotaro humming Super Mario made my day lol
Dumpling first then the choko banana of course ! :D
Some Brits in Japan only eat Chicken & Broccoli. Chris eats Chicken & Banana.
Ryotaro: *sings Mario theme tune* Nintendo: Nice video......too bad it's OURS NOW! *submits copyright claim* :P
Been loving your vids. Stuck at home due to health (Unrelated to the pandemic) and a nonexistent summer, and get VERY bored, Finding your channel has been great, very entertaining. Shoutout from Miyazus Sister city, Nelson New Zealand.  Keep up the amazing vids, loving seeing Japan and the adventures you guys are having.
So hungry right now...
damn those dumplings do look good, i'd totally get that for breakfast... and chocobanana as dessert :D
9:26 - Umami just means savory.
I'd just spend all 2,000¥ on choco bananas!
I always  want the chocobanana but my wife forbids it.
Wheres the other Japanese fella friend
Chocolate banana.
I'd start with the chocolate banana too tbh. Chocolate overed for me!
Tokyo banana, chocobanana...why do I feel like Chris is in the pocket of Big Dole?
This looks more real
That sausage wasn't well done. It became congratulations
Street Food?  How about a live bat? -Ozzy
I just ate and now I'm hungry again....thanks guys....
*germanly jealous of chris beeing able to interact with other human beeings right now*
A reason to go to Sendai on its own.  That BBQ looked awesome.
The word 'shrimp' actually starts with a 'p'.
Risottoro should have been proud that THE FIRST  wasnt fried chicken. Im proud. Also bananas are one of the few safe sources for potassium. VITAL. we never have enough. It was the healthiest option on the market. ...ignoring the chocolate
This is the real japan. Small markets in the back towns, with great food and great company.
YES! RISOTTORO !!!
Chris got to get in his dessert first before anything else. Chocolate Banana is like eating Apple Fritter for breakfast
It impresses me how fast Japan rebuilds from Tsunamis... If I'm mostly vegetarian, what should my meal choices be in Japan?
isn't it winter over there? Or are you guys having a warm winter??
My Saturday just got even better!
"Yuriyage Morning Market" would make a great anime series name.
Dave in Japan eating a pink chocolate covered banana looked almost obscene! 🤪
You actually had a STRAWBERRY ICING BANANA you pommel git
Chocolate banana and fried chivken???? And you wonder why you're cute and chubby!
Choco banana!
Love these food!
For a moment I thought we saw the return of the 2nd bonito concrete floor
Congrats on 2 million! 🎉🎊🥳🎋🎏🎐🪅🎌
Wow it's Ryotaro, the funnier and more handsome YouTuber! I'm jealous of you, Chris.
where is your jacket chris . are you sweating on a cold day out there ?
😁👍
Chocolate banana is the ultimate market food. I would have done the same and first bought the choco banana
Nice video!
Not gonna lie, I saw those pink bananas and immediately my immature brain went👀👀👀🙊🙊🙊😂😂
Chocolate banana
Umami is justice.
doge at 8:44
Chocobanana over pork and shrimp dumplings with kimchi? Whaaaaat??!! Ryotaro wins by default. No need to go any further. 🏆
Every time I see the face of Chris I get hungry ^^
What $40 buys you at a Japanese STREET FOOD Market*
Anything on a skewer, eh Chris?
I've never seen tuna gills for sale. What do they taste like?
"he's gonna get some shit and I'm gonna get something good" 😂
remember kid eat your bananas for all your important vitamin nylon
Mans said "Rawr" xD
Love the Japanese people.
Love the interaction between you guys. You both looked like you were having a lot of fun. 👍
I'm disappointed Chris didn't steal a boat there.
Chocolate banana Chocolate banana Chocolate banana
I am sure the chocobanana will soon make its way to the UK, where it will be promptly deep fried and shared with the general public!
Ryotaro cant get over the chocolate banana rating 🤣🤣🤣
I was waiting the whole video for Ryotaro to say “Peasant”! Did it at the last second of the video, thank you!
Ryotaros kitchen? More like Hell’s Kitchen
10:24 Reject Ryotaro, return to monke.
Been missing Risotto, glad he's showing up again.
Piroge, dumplings, peioroghye( Born in ukraine moms side is russian) based off my exp living in states most foods from all nationalities reflect upon which food is selected that pertains to the similar /and or the same type of food of each country/nationality. The only usually noticeable   difference is the style each individual country serves  ( most will differ based of location ethnicity as well as race).  This also does not apply too all food just MOST. Also i love your criticism England Lives on in japan!
"Mayuri, can you say that again?" "Chocoba--" "WHAT ARE YOU MAKING HER SAY, PERVERT?"
chocobanana is the correct choice to start the day
you’re dialogue voice overs sound so professional chris i’m liking it
Now you’ve done it. I’ve just had breakfast but I’m starving all over again after watching this. My diet is ruined. Dear god that food looks so good.
Chris, you upgraded to 5k and thought we wouldn't notice you cheeky bastard. 5k is an odd number, change it back, also good video as always, enjoyed watching it while eating breakfast where im at
Seeing Chris' genuine enthusiasm for those chocobananas is so wholesome and pure hahaha
Hello chrisp
Yes. I want the chocobanana.
Chris always makes the same face in the thumb... must be what gets the clicks. Too bad you have to do that everytime eh? Haha
Rissotoro using chopsticks 2:30
gotta love a risottoro video
I still don't understand what Umami is 😒
Ryotoros next attempt to kill Chris using food poisoning. Ahhh nice try... 🤣(Plot twist: Ryotoros secretly Yakuza)
I accidentally clicked the dislike button and almost had a blooming heart attack, forgetting I can actually undo that 🤦🏼‍♀️
The easiest way to describe umami is MSG.
Aweee such a cute couple. They even wore matching colored shirt ❤️
"nylon"  lol
Chris, I love that you picked the pink chocolate banana because that was the one I was eyeing too. After that, I think that beef bowl that you had at the end would be my second choice, topped off with the 7 dollar strawberry drink.
man i cant believe people try so hard to live a happy life,people in my country work hard to ruin what good i/we do
I love watching these two go on dates together. So cute 🤗
“Strawberry milk is not for peasants” 😂 love it!
Kinda wanted to see more of that BBQ.
If Chris didn't get that chocolate banana this wouldn't be abroad in japan
Good way of promoting your tsunami video =)
There's always money in the banana stand!
No choice but to watch these videos flipping off the screen the whole time as I am so jealous. Great stuff as always
Those vendors are very polite and kind. Japanese is really out of this world league
Did anyone else see the man with two dogs in their Jacket 1:18
Sempai
Now I want menudo
love the occasional banter between both of them hahaha best foodie duo!
not gonna lie that Tuna collar looks mighty nice
nigga whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
These are my favorite of all your videos! 🤤 Food videos!!!
You guys should open your own steakhouse with all that roasting you serve to each other. :D
about time
Ah a classic style Abroad in Japan video!
“underwhelming japanese villain” LOL
CHOCOLATE BANANA!
Don't worry Chris I would of ate the chocobanana too! Though I am diabetic so that wouldn't end well 👀
I was getting anxious that you wouldn’t get the pink banana.
In my view the real one is deim.monster/teg-guide/ I used it today "4:40"
Was Ryotaro really off in this video- or have I just completely ret-conned in my mind his english speaking skills to be way better than they actually are? Don't get me wrong he's a talented linguist having learned so many languages, I just don't recall him saying so many 'Natsuki-isms' (ex. "giving the right judge" "like a Mario") in previous videos. For some reason, I also can't decide if ¥250 for a choco-sprinkle banana is a good deal or too expensive, but it is undeniably the breakfast of champions.
Hey! love your videos! <3 fatty
okay to start, as a woman, I would not want to eat a whole banana like that in public... maybe that's just me LOL. Also, I am amazed a market like this is still open. Here in the US any tight-packed events like this have been largely closed down because of Covid. Everything looked super delicous! I am quite envious tbh.
1:06 a wild Canadian flag is spotted LOL
Wait wait wait... Chocolate is pink? When? For how long? WHY?!
Don’t really care what they do just here to see Rissottaro and Chris bonding/banter, feels almost same as a comedy sitcom
Need a cooking video with sharla and Chris! Rissitaro can come too... I guess
Will we finally have weekly uploads?
Just wanted to say thank you for all your hard with with these videos. I’ve been going through a rough time (most of us, probably) and seeing your vids makes me feel a little better. Keep it up, Chris ! :D
I really need to go to Japan for breakfast
Watching this at 3am is a very bad idea... I'm drooling right now.
Revising the ranking. Wise move. You probably don't want Ryutaro to hold a banana against you.
Watching this while eating self made mac n cheese
7:40 No, it's called fkd up.
by far one of my favourite youtubers
*Another* food video? Gorramit, Chris! You're making me HUNGRY! =>[.]<=
最高でした〜❤️
¥1000 = €7,88 = $9,49
Good video, DAVE IN JAPAN
All your vitamin B...nanna
All I want is a chocolate banana now lol
“And they have garlic-“ Parm? “Seaweed!” Ah, right.
I can't fault Chris for choosing chocolate bananas. Those things are dope.
8:41, This guy is so devious he's trying to get Chris video a copyright strike with a mario song.
For $20.00 you couldn't even get half of what they bought at an American farmers market.
Uncle Roger @ 4:40
I wonder what Chris thinks is better, choco banana or FamilyMart chicken? 🤔
It's a tuna collar
What Christ gets at a Japanese morning market: Chocolate banana and fried chicken, classic Japanese dishes.
The chocobanana kinda looks like a dildo.
Oh look it's chris england
watching abroad on japan makes me hungry and wish I had my own arch-villain as cool as ryotaro.
aawwh cute guys, matching outfits!
no chicken and broccoli 0/10
WHERES PART 2!!
Chris Broad and❤ Ryotaro. Save the date.
"we already visited there back in February"  But wait Chris, this month is still February...
Always a big fan of Ryotaro's accent.
I really want chocobanana.
Chocobanana.........reminded me of brother when we went for a caffe that's is almost like an "all-you can eat", and he chose, out of many expensive, exquisite and varied cakes, pies, just a bit of Grape Jelly. Yeah, I van relate all too well to Ryotaro on this one
Now I want a chocolate banana...
Fried chicken and shrimp are both good
Owes everything to Bourdain for his verite' food doc approach...
This was a great video. The food looked so great it made me hungry just watching.
It's nice to watch a video with great food while you eat your instant noodles
Why doesn't grow back his stylish beard???
5:28 My man ryotaro enjoying his food in the background, good shit 😂
amino acid xD I'm done
Jesus Christ, Chris. I was already craving karaage today. Way to make me want to eat it even more.
When is the next installment of Journey up some stairs?
IM HUNGRY NOW
15k likes in 4 hours? Hot damn, dude.
Crazy. In Sendai??? You are eating radioactive contaminated fooood.......
Just by watching I am getting hungry. Welp imma go cook some instant ramen
8:42 le wild shiba appears
3:04 There is always money in the banana stand wink wink.
Err, doesn't Ryotaro actually own a restaurant? And he can't cook?
Ryotaro calling Chris a peasant at the end just tops everything off so nicely 😂😂😂
Another well made and humorous video. Just love you guys.
Very good video Chris. Perfect to watch in the early morning. Very chill video! 😊
That looks soooo goood. Making me hungry here, mang. The steam at 2:35 is fantastic.
Good sausage should have a char on the casing. It's the best part!
tell you what, that crack is really moreish
8:42 DOGGO
I wish I could smell the food from this video!
Fuck all the haters I would’ve gotten a chocolate banana too!
Ryotaro’s chopstick snapping technique??!!
How does you get a humanitarian parole to visit Japan? Can't wait for the travel ban to be lifted.
I was SURE you had chicken karaage even before I clicked play. I wasn't disappointed. :) Also, I never knew I needed gyoza with kimchi until I saw it. Now I NEED it.
Ryotaro is the cutest ever!
Just stumbled upon your channel. This is amazing how such small youtuber could get someone like Ryotaro to appear in your video. He really must have a heart of gold to help you so much.
He's run out of ideas. We need more reaction videos.
So, is Japanese street food safe from Gutter Oil, or is that an actual risk?
I just spent $40 at a favorite ramen & donburi restaurant. Called zundo in mason Ohio deep fried squid legs $7 soda $4 spicy miso ramen $13 una don $20 and sasadango $4
Now I'm hungry ;w;
Peasant!
We have these in America but only in Mexican places. You can buy food and toys and clothes it’s pretty cool
Well Chris the chocobananas were there so oh well lol it looked delicious!!!
Was this taped recently? How is the weather so nice on January/February?
wow chris has run out of ideas :^)
Was just about to sleep but now I can't. Seeing Ryotaro eat that juicy gyoza really makes me hungry. Looks very UMAMI.
Thats actually better than i expected after always hearing how expensive japan is
i love this!! best thing to start off the day🤩😊
This guy looks a lot like Dave in Japan
Yo that's not a real choco banana , real ones are frozen bro
Next you can go to a hot springs bath and take a shower.
Chris is love.......Choco Banana MEGA love👍🏻
I died at the "RAWR"
fuck me, I´m watching this at 15:30pm and now I want fried chiken... I can´t get it until 19 or 20pm it´s going to be a long afternoon...
"There's money in the banana stand"
Bet you can taste the riboflavin in that banana huh?
Matching black Ts i see~
Can we have _do_ _you_ _feel_ _the_ _seaweed_ on a T-shirt 👁👄👁
The long hair girl at 7:56 is lowkey cute🥺
what if the bowl actually fall
4:40 Uncle Roger agreeing that the chicken is good
3:05 Is Chris color blind
5:29  Ryotaro- 🥢🥟👀... Stealing the show just munchin away
It's hard to work out just how this duo works so well, because there isn't a clearly defined straight and comedic quirky in the relationship, as there is with Natsuki.
Ryotaro doesn't burn the food, he caramelizes it, that's how you know he's a proper chef
WHY ARE YOU NOT MASKED?!
Ryotaro's english gets worse and worse by the day.
It's great seeing a father and son bonding over different food tastes.
I see that all those Family Mart fried chicken Chris has eaten has made him a "Fried chicken connoisseur".
Chris is right, you should try Choco Banana, it's an _a-peel-ing food afterall xD
How can you call japan's  most handsome man a villain? Terrible Chris.🤣🤣🤣
Pretty sure the most impressive thing about this video is Chris being up at 7am, but there is food involved... Joking aside, the food all looked amazing, except for that burned sausage.
Nintendo: copy strike??
7:07 That lady in the right hand corner is like "wtf is this idiot doing?"
Nice video^^ What you think, can we fly on October again to Japan? :)
I would have stuffed myself full with 1.000
Chris your upload schedule is random as hell lol.
I love how they’re both friends and mortal enemies 🤣
Great video. I love how you connected it back to your amazing video on the strawberry industry recover after the disaster. Please do this more often at end of videos so people can see some of the great stuff they might have missed and your hard work videos get to be seen more and more. Very talent, much like
UMAMI is EAST STAR inbound to Dubai OMDB. Now i know what does UMAMI mean 😊
Chris.. a video idea: get yourself a diving license and get diving at Izu or any other diving spot in japan. Nobody has done it yet.. at least that I know of..
12:30 using your podcast outro in a video, cheeky devil!
There's always money in the banana stand
♥️Thank you so much this is nice 👍        Big Street Food  🍱!!
umami. better call it mono natrium glutamate hahah the crystal wich ripps open ur tastbuds, slit nerves to make me drip.    ...should have become cardi b's texter / writer. kms ;)
8:44 Wheelchair lap-dog steals the show
What a steal, three bowls and Ryotaro as a personal chef!
Ah my favourite nylon rich banana 🍌
OMG ANOTHER VIDEO WOOHOO
7:38 “it’s called well done”  that killed me lmaoo
You went to a Japanese market and had ONLY ONE chocolate banana?
Why are you only in a T-shirt in early february, Chris? Are you not cold!?    (Look further in the video)   Awh, good. You have a sweater. Fals alarm!  Stay cool Chris, but not too much!
Ryotaro is like the guy you go to when you need something done. Am i right?
How DARE you! The banana chocolate clearly deserves 9/10 !
8:42 OH LOOK AT THE DOGGIE! :>
Chocolate banana then fried chicken, sounds very American.
I can just picture tourists coming for the ultimate Japanese experience, kneeling on bamboo mats, a tea ceremony lady in ornate kimono serving them an elaborate tea, and suddenly she whips out pink choco bananas with rainbow sprinkles while an announcer doing his best Toshiro Mifune samurai voice says “Kore wa Nihon desu!”
Just ate breakfast and now I'm hungry again
I’m currently have to quarantine cause my father caught COVID from work and I turned out to be an asymptomatic carrier, so this is a nice sense of the outside world
There is no way all the stuff you bought was under 2000 yen c'mon man
2:28 I was distracted by the man with the Shiba Inu in the background. 8:43 Spotted another.
I can't wait to go to Japan and try this street food once we are able to fly internationally again
First time I noticed the 5k option
chris i know youll never see this in the sea of comments but i love the quality of your videos. really fells like im on a Japanese tour and all it cost is 30 seconds of my time to watch an ad.
I wont deny it, I want to put chocolate on Chris's Banana
“Animal acid” -riotoro.
Hey Chris, how much royalties do you pay Natsuki for each "WOW!" used on the podcast? 😂
It was like a YouTube thank you. Need more chicken
I swear Ryotaro's English gets worse the more he speaks it.  Still better than my Japanese, though.
Up until 2021 Steak N Shake used to have Chocolate Banana shakes. U could do soide by side or just the mix. That was BY FAR the best milk shake Ive ever had in my life. They stopped selling real fruit shakes though. 😢
Watching this while eating my homemade okonomiyaki. 🙂
Zinc, copper, nylon - all from a banana. Yes, top tier medical advice from BROAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADD! :D
Chris V Food
umami is the meaty savoury flavour you get from meats, mushrooms, fish etc.
Imagine being a vegan and living in Japan.
Did I hear "Fuiyooh!" in the background at 4:40?
8:43 that dog though
When I read the title of the video, I said Chris will definitely start his morning with fried chicken. I was wrong. We need more food videos 👍🏽
Could've had 8 chocolate bananas
Umami = ajinomoto
Thank you for the quality and care that you put in all your productions, Chris.
What is Ryotaro doing 44 seconds into this clip?
Chris and Ryotaro are the true relationship goal
5:19 I don't see any fail in his logic. He got you there, Chris.
Chris! Great video as usual mate. I was wondering, what happened to your subtitles in other languages? I speak english but I used to see your videos with my wife who doesn't speak english very well, so I activated the spanish subtitles that most of your videos use to have. Is there any reason that you don't have them anymore? I don't know how the subtitles system work on youtube so I was wondering. Thanks in advance and awesome video as usual!
YES! I SEE RYOTARI I CLICKKKK
I'm coming to Japan solely for the chocolate banana.
God-damn, I wish I could get my breakfast there... and I wish i had the money to get all this.
Chris, when in doubt, fried garlic shrimp. 👍 Or, fried garlic anything.  😍  There should be so much garlic your eyes weep.  It's a natural antibiotic and it keeps people away during the pandemic.  👍👍
Ryotaro's kitchen... Sounds like a great idea!
Was that "Beef Bowl" the much anticipated follow up to "Deer Bear Boar?"
That looks like a lot fun
When you live in a never-ending lockdown... looking longingly at the relative normativity of that market ;__;
This is life.
1:17 Pocket dogs
I'm sorry, 1000 yen for that BBQ set?! That alone is worth the trip up.
I'd have chosen a choco banana, too lol. All those food looked good especially the karaage and the choco banana. The strawberry milk, too. I wanna eat!!
I cant wait to visit a Japanese 5* restaurant and order a choclate bannana
Wheres NATSUKI
This reminds me of places like Pike street market is Seattle WA before the state went to shit.  Also Chris; Umami, savoriness. Taste like glutamates and nucleotides, both of which are widely present in meat broths and fermented products. Glutamates, Glutamic acid is an α-amino acid that is used by almost all living beings in the biosynthesis of proteins. Nucleotides are organic molecules consisting of a nucleoside and a phosphate. They serve as monomeric units of the nucleic acid polymers deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which are essential biomolecules within all life-forms on Earth.  So yeah, you can actually say Umami is the flavor of fermented or fatty.
Chocolate banana peasant, Chris broad
Poms (Chris: I'm Not Fat T-Shirt) have the worst sense of healthy food in the world, despite having good stuff available. Ryotoro is getting the good stuff. Nearly as bad as the crew from Tokyo Creative. 🤭
Ryotaro is such a great host. He's a natural.
2:28 Kimchi like a Jenga...new Merch incoming?
Dave in Japan should change his channel name..."Eating in Japan"
I really enjoy seeing those two having fun and joking together!
This kind of video can only happen in Japan. Anywhere else in the world and I would be too paranoid about the hygiene  standards...
Just started watching and I've already noticed something strange... they're actually being civil with each other. :O
Chris' breakfast: Spends 20 dollars just for breakfast....and then not actually following the budget and bought a strawberry milkshake and more chocobanana...I see a pattern here..lol
I'm glad Chris adjusted his chocobana score XD Karaage chicken is just always so darn good... of course so is a chocobanana...
New vid😎
this channel is 90% food reviews tbh
Ayyyyyy
Can't wait to visit here is October (fingers crossed)
Bonito Fish Broth < The First Bonito Concrete Floor.
I´m always very well entertained whenever I watch a new video of yours, Chris. You´ve made lockdown much more bearable and I cannot wait to visit Japan myself once this is all over!
I like "new" editing style
It’s 7 o’clock in the mornin’ and I’m still fat as shit.
Just here taking notices, so when i go to Japan
The crowds and no distancing - is covid under control there?
*me taking notes for the trip I'm gonna drag mom in so we can paint Japan's landscapes*
Everyone's wearing sweaters and long shirts, and Chris out there in nothing but a thin v-neck shirt. Clearly tryna show off his fitness gains. Lookin good mate haha!
Good ole food videos. My favorite
Wow.... Never heard of chocolate bananas?!
"AGAIN, it's called WELL DONE."
4:01 obviously shrimp is better
The kimchi dumpling, the fried chicken and the 3 bowls are definitely what I'd go for 😋👌🏾
Actualy I like Beef intestine. The trick to eating it is to swallow them whole or else it won't go down my throat, but the soup is really good.
I love ryotaro
This was a really fun watch
Hey man, those choco banana are always at the matsuri! It’s very Japanese! 😂 In all seriousness, that all looks freaking delicious. Just, don’t let Ryotoro cook, next time. 🤣
I belive theres even a choclate banana hidden behind the red sun on their national flag
DOGO!
7:40, no Ryotaro, it is called the Maillard reaction and that baby, is FLAVOR.
But i thought you weren't suppose to eat chocobanana that way 🤔
Love this video . Love seeing the real Japan ❤️
7:39 This man is actually eating a sausage on a stick, WITH TWO MORE STICKS!?
Mmmmm!
This is a imposter chris, there is no way the real chris would be up this early
And now its 1am and im fucking hungry.  Damn you Chris Banana
chris is a chocolate banana
I wonder if Japanese chocolate tastes the same as British or European chocolate, they say American chocolate tastes like sick because of an additive they put in it.
"Well-Done Sausage" - Yeah I can see why Ryotaro is a despicable man
So Hakata is basically the Mexican equivalent to Menudo. Beef tripe. That’s awesome!
Pro tip, Chris: removing the sausage from the grill to eat it before it turns black, prevents it from turning black. Can’t really blame the chef on that one 😉 although I like the more charred ones personally
You went to a Japanese street market and had a chocolate banana?  I'm so jealous. I didn't know that was an option.
7:06.
What a fun video i love it.
Invite Conor next time!
Riotoro is best
Top tier banter! For some reason it really looked like you were both having fun.
Umami = Addiction! Well said and I completely agree.
It’s only been like an hour and this video has a billion views!
Omnomnomnom
I want to know more about those in the background at 08:10
Oh man, I want a Chocobanana now. 😋
Are there many/any vegetarian options? :(
yayyyy another video, havent watched it yet but i know its gonna be great. cant wait for the next one !! :D
You've been enjoying food lately I see 👀
Riotaro "do do dodo" Nintendo lawyers have entered the chat
Chris looks slimmer!
Take a shot every time they say “chocolate banana”
Wow, covid19 still can go out buy. ... no officers come and catch.if us more than 5 pple mingle will catch . Nice. Then all must be 1m to 2m apart, if not catch.
Gimmy children
Chocobanana content... brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you Chris, for giving people the content they crave for. Now the only thing missing is you opening an onlyfans or patreon and only posting chocobanana pictures/videos. You'd make so much money from your fans in on the joke!
You can see he's British. Everyone wearing a jacket, while he's in a tshirt xd
Yo, did anyone else get slapped in the face by the tremendous swag popping out of the screen when Ryotaro split chopsticks with his teeth?
Ian Malcom: Chris makes food video-Chris gets fat Chris gets fat-Chris makes cycling series to burn fat Chris fails to lose fat-Ryotoro and Sharla inherit the youtube
I wish I was there my Japan plands were spoiled by covid
I hope this doesn't get copyrighted because of the super mario song
Deer, bear, boar. Deer, bear, boar, and now we have beef bowl,  beef bowl, beef bowl. Along with "OH OH OH OH OH OH"   I think this is the start of a Ryotaro remix track.
I love you Chris
I love kicking off my day with a banana to get my daily dose of copper and nylon.
Is that Uncle Roger in the background screaming "Fuiyoooo!" at 4:40
I love watching these kind of videos, it just makes me want to go to Japan!
What happened to all if the food from the bbq that ryotardo made?
How come you aint freezing with only a t-shirt on or is it warmer right now or is Chris just a british secret Viking
Ryotaro :Beautiful steamy fresh gyoza with vibrant kimchi on top. Chris: Pink banana
Ryotaro > Mario
Amazing video! Everything looks so tasty!
Seeing so many people in one place makes me a bit anxious atm ^^"
What a productive morning you had.. Thank you for sharing your experiences through these videos. It made me feel like I'm actually there. Loving the Japanese foods :)
I mean you can't go wrong with a chocolate banana... Would I have personally ordered one? No, but that's because there are so many other foods there that are more unique lol
I associate chocolate banana with a fun fair (Kirmes)
Can you make a video about Japanese universities..?
Very nice video
A video in 5K by a peasant, interesting. The world has indeed advanced a lot.
Well late but before 1k comment  N good food
"healthy innit" ah yes chocolate, the healthiest ingredient on earth
Ramen
There's always money in the banana stand
“Japan’s most questionable chef” in the description 😂 I really thought he was cool
At some point Chris's food channel Abroad in a pan will become a reality at this point
Ryotoro saying 'shit' really made my day
There's always money in the banana stand.
Well done Chris chicken is the best choice that meat though with all those flavours.
UK still on lockdown. Japan almost business as usual.
So cool seeing the bustle of markets 😮 I love the range of foods and the comparison of both of you getting different foods and seeing what people might enjoy
Ryotaro looks like Sam the Eagle from the muppets
Super interesting video (as always)! I absolutely love your style of documentaries/videos, always lively and full of information
閖上！宮城きた！！！ 混んでるイメージあるけど近くだし今度行ってみます！
"Risottoro reacting to Chris eating a chocobanana" - a food and reaction vid rolled into one, the perfect storm of ingredients for YouTube success!
Great video!
Okay but hearing Ryotaro called Chris' taste in food shit and his just good was everything
your videos are pure gold! I love them so much! <3
0:43, that's not what you want to see in the prison showers.
Don’t know what I would do without my daily nylon from my morning banana
WIth 20$ dollars i can feed a 4 members family for 2 o 3 days , 3 meals x day in my country , the difference in the cost of living is unbelievable
Oh please please say something about anime!!!!!!!
“There's always money in the banana stand” George Bluth Sr.
Its fun too see that you had alot of fun in the video. Keep up the great work and dont forget to have fun!
To be fair, those chocolate bananas looked delicious. Now I‘m craving some choccy bananas 🤤
I need “kimchi like a jenga” on a shirt. 🙏🤞
That's the best part of tuna to grill. 💕
I just saw Chris eat burger king with  Sharmeleon, now he's eating more food. Do your pants have an elastic waistband?
Love your videos Chris keep them up!  Much love from Las Vegas
Now this a perfect way to start a Saturday morning in the States, sadly my waffle doesn’t compare.
Sorry Chris, I respect and admire you for many reasons. But your eating habits isnt one of them.
On 8:44 u see a guy with his cute dog sitting on his leg.
Yeah, because "chocolate" is a very japanese word
Chokobanana.. a lot of daily vitamin and energy spike :-) Contrast to Ryotaro's selection is enormous.
Someone should react to this video lol
Rissotoro definitely came out on top with his options.
"Your zinc your copper... nylon" Hahaa!! Love this guy XD
Great vid!  The soups and beef bowl look amazing.
i hate amercia our food sucks..... its like 20 for a welldone burger
I was suspicious of the nanna on a stick at first as I thought it was sausage covered in chocolate. Who in the right mind would put that combo into practise. "Here, have a cumberland wheel dipped in chocolate with hundreds and thousends." No ta thats minging.
Ryotaro speaks fluent Japenenglish.
"rawr xd" - Ryotaro 2021
I see you enjoy eating.
Lovely old job!
A seaside Japanese market where I can barbecue my selections on site? The Southern boy in me has passed out from sheer delight.
That banana looks fucking divine
Chicken and banana!
And I'm sittin' here with my stale bread... Thank you Chris!
wish my country had street food
the best part of this is the RAWR!
Still waiting for a day there is a video on this channel that does not involve food, but not today.
Shrimps>chiken
sugoi
Before i saw the video, i knew it was going to be about something skewered on a stick
Pink banana remind me of pink guy :(
Chick at 7:07 checking out Ryotaro's, ummm, skillz - and he didn't even know it. Chris is right about that guy, can't even feel it when someone's checking out his *ss.
choco banana's i would do the same chris. was there choco apples too?
Dude I want to eat that chocolate banana it really looks tasty
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Entertaining as usual. On a note side, there is too much food exposed, like the kimchi plate. Not hygienic. Chocolate banana... Chris... I need to make you try my French waffles coated with special secret marshmallow recipe, and glazed with chocolate.
8:39 yo, hold yo horses Ryotaro, you will will get this video claimed
umami = msg
Ryotoro is so cute.
I'm surprised that Chris doesn't go to morning markets more often considering his crippling fried chicken addiction.
You went to a japanese morning market and had a chocolate banana!??
Hey Chris, just wondering if you've done a Collab with John From Only in Japan yet? I think it could be a sweet dynamic.
At least once a year Chris has to make a video of him eating a fried chicken
Risottoro: umami is the tast in which amino acids react with the mitochondrial powerhouses or the human genome. Creating a "blast of tastebud reactions to the host" Chris: bruh. English Rissotoro: the addiction
Well chris is desperate for bananas 🍌
What I would give to visit that place 😭 Chris and Ryotoro should make a dedicated series about food in Japan
Wowo I've been here!!
Why does everyone use $ to explain money?
Was wondering why your videos were not coming up on my notifications, for some reason the bell is crossed out. So I clicked on it, & it says that I can't get notifications because you're a kids channel. When did that happen?
I wish these where 30mins
a banana coated with chocolate is worth ¥250, the bbq bundle is worth ¥1000, and the bowl of 3 meals worth ¥1000. Is banana really that expensive in japan or the chocolate?
CHRIS so plump he knows 100% what $20 buys in street food, don't deny
I used to take a bite of chocolate and then take a bite of banana when I was younger. When I found out Chocolate bananas were a thing in Japan I was all like: :O "I gotta try that" Kudos to you Chris
The bbq Ryotaro did, looked good. I wonder if Natsuki was there he’d say the fish gills were fish trash lol
Chicobanana ... THAT'S GAY
I am a huge foody and i love having food videos please keep them coming.
Where I live, breakfast costs 1$ or less . So 20$ is ludicrously expensive.
Why did I torture myself by watching this in the morning before breakfast?
Umami probably is savoury flavor
ryotaro definitely watched this video, after all it has him in it 😂
INB4 Nintendo copyrights the vid for Ryotaro's song.
In every New video Ryotaro's accent is stronger than the last one
Great video Chris, the food looked awesome, great seeing Ryotaro. I definitely have to see the market when I get to Japan.
8:45 I like how that man is just sitting there petting the dog
You r eating again huh.  Please try not to eat chocolate banana as morning meal.
Gorgeous girl who served 3 dishes ☺️
8:41 Can he get a copy strike for this ?
To be fair to Chris, the banana is a dessert dish, so that's a totally different category compared to the chicken karaage, and the soups! So giving it a 9 out of 10 is still reasonable if you're only comparing it to dessert foods and not the more savory foods.
Trust the Englishman to go straight to the junk food!
Chicken and banana for breakfast 😂
Looking very handsome in this one, Ryotaro
Just woke up US now it's a good morning
I'm watching this hungry. Not a good idea.
i feel everthing.. next image: pink bananas 👀 Chris just let us know.. it.
I haven't eaten yet and I see this.  Thank you
Your friend Risotto seems like a cool guy !
I swear, chris is just finding new areas to just eat fried chicken
Peasant!
That all looks so good and also engaging, if youtube is listening.
This is why im here for, chocolate banana. Yes Chris!!!
Just ate a banana and then I see thr choco one... God dam
A Japanese guy in a Full sleeve black t-shirt eating some dumplings.....ahhh...a man of culture i see !! A British guy in half sleeve black t-shirt craving some pink chocolate banana's.....I see a man with strong libido  !!
Did you really delete my "pot-bellied pig" Crayon Shin-chan reference from the episode about having to eat a lot of ramen? Come on, Chris.
Some say he's still there eating chocolate bananas to this day
Tuna collar is very different from gills 8')
Who cares about the chocolate banana? I want to know how dodgy Ryotaro's BBQ was that there were no shots of it apart from the burnt sausage. You didn't even gave it a rating!
I am watching this in 4k on a 4k screen. You're welcome
I love chocolate, I love banana what else could I ask for?  Yes, chocobanana! 😋🍫🍌
Bro, it looks tantalizing to this vegetarian, right here. I'm gonna cry.
first bonito concrete floor
Risottoro's English is like a teaser, a cosmetic DLC, to Natsuki's English.
I love these food market videos as they take me back to when I was there in Japan! It's like a buffet except everything is a specialty to each store!
I like how my man Chris has just been upscaling his content as much as he can. 5K!
You do see chocolate bananas on sticks pretty much everywhere in Japan😂
Dude those shrimp are huge
The sashaying toward the BBQ with a tray of food is everything for a Saturday morning.
Imagine being able to go to a market in the age of Covid >:(  Great video I’m hungry now >:(  Nothing but negative feelings have come out of posting this video >:(
take a shot everytime someone says choco banana
Ryotoro's watch is THOOMIN
chris loves bananas. first thing in the morning LuL
Lol. Playing with the plastic cover against the wind. You're such a dork. Love it
2 Chris vids tonight! What a treat 😍 anyone else coming here from Sharla's vid? 🤣 Also, it's so nice to see these two in the same video once again It feels like it's been too long
THE SAME AS THE CHOCOBANANA!!??
The chocobanana obsession isn't quite surprising. Ryotoro might even plan something vicious with it.
waw
It is lunch time for me.
I see Ryotaro's busy working on his own soundboard.
So now that he's started his own channel can we start calling Ryotaro "Abroad with a tan"? Lol thanks for the content as always.
Can't wait for the reactions videos for this one
Your mug is honestly EPIC
Brilliant video, really worth watching, honestly I love it when I see you've uploaded cus I know ill always want to watch it
Why is Roro here? Doesn't he have his own channel? 😏
That awkward moment when Chris makes a video in 5k but your pc is so shit that you have to watch it in 1080p.  . . . . . Sad life.
Hmmm.. think Ryotaro's missing a trick here. He needs to produce a recipe book for Westerners. I can see him demonstrating his cooking skills on Good Morning Britain or some other such channel, and i think he could have a big success with it. Ryotaro-find yourself an English agent!
i like morning markets, especially on Saturdays. Can hang out with friends for breakfast and buy food for the rest of the day. Did you need to light the barbeque pit yourself, or had to get someone to light it for you?
Get yourself a man who looks at you like Chris looks at chocolate banana's
I really not sure how much food I could eat this early in the morning, but I guess if you're up early enough this might just be justice delicous. And that food does indeed look delicious, while the price really is pretty cheap.
I wonder what Chris will be eating next episode
8:08 i see a little japanese love story in the background
Oh God Japan is very expensive.
God, I am so hungry!!! I would eat all those food!!! I mean, not the barbecue, because it would take too much time to get done. I love japanese food!!! These two guys are so funny!!!
hey ever thought about making a video about kaiseki? i am super interested in the whole philosophy and craft behind it.
For anyone wondering. The intro music is "Cats Walking"
Pls gimmie a heart🥺
You should do a video about Plant Vineyards. Another excuse to hang out with Blaise Plant!
Gyudoooon~~~~ <3
Always feel a bit sad when the video ends
The strawberry milk is what I honestly want to try 😅😂
Ryotaro missed his chances for assassination while handing over the 2000 yen
my new favorite word to describe chris, PEASANT
@3:20 "Michael, there's MONEY in the banana stand."   (Arrested Development in case anyone puzzled.)
Umami is "Gurih"
I love the guy at 4:40 who just yells fuyoh
Hate Ryotaro
It ain't abroad in Japan without fried chicken.
Another great video! I actually got the notification thistime too!
I love these videos so much, everytime i see it in my subs i get so excited. I hope I can go to japan one day!!
Honestly I'd also het a chocolate banana first 😂🍌🍫
First meal of the day and you start out with a banana with chocolate so to finish off the morning don't for get to have a tomato juice and beer combo. lol
Good God I'm hungry now.
I do kinda want a Chocolate Banana, also want to try the Strawberry Milk
8:44 Dog !!
8:42 Shiba on a chair
Wow that's a lot for 1000 yen. I want to go to countryside some time
There always money in the banana stand.
Shiba Inu spotted at 8:44.
Kudos on the great Japanese spirit to bounce back from adversity and quickly rebuild after disasters... whether it's tsunami wave 🌊 , destruction by Giant Robot Mecha 🤖 , or an attack from Godzilla 🐲
Ryotaro is such a sexy middle-aged Japanese guy...at least more than Chris is a sexy any-aged British guy. ;-)  I still love Chris, though.
"It's called well done" - Ryotaro the greatest barby chef
Whens it gonna end Robbie?
I'm convinced that this video was secretly sponsored by Chocolate Bananas Inc. because I've never wanted a chocolate banana more than I do after watching this video.
It’s quite interesting to see chocobanana being popular in the morning market in Japan. It’s a VERY popular street food in Latin America, specifically in Central America...But ratings it 9/10?!?!? That crazy Chris!! Ryotaro has all the reason to judge you 😂 😂
i noticed clips that got used twice.   200iq
I love this kind of content to be honest.
Whats more intriguing, nylon in the banana or ryotaro in the kitchen
This is turning it, a selection of mukbang channels
Nice!
It almost midnight in here and this video make me hungry for something hahahaha 🇵🇭😋😂
I’ve never been this early 😳
7:41 Well done?? More like well burnt...
My sister has an allergy to seafood and is going to be coming to stay with me while I'm there. Can you help me out with a survival guide for her?
AYYYY NEW VIDEO
8:43 omg that shibe <3
Gyoza? Dumplings? Funny way to cal something that is clearly pelmenni 😂
How in the hell do the Japanese people stay thin with all of that fried food?!!
To be honest, seeing Chris eating a chocolate banana made me so envious. Because since all the amazing German market are closed this is all I've been craving, fruit dipped in chocolate
that garlic karaage looks so fucking good
I'm happy that side character from Ryotaro's Japan channel opened his channel. I hope he becomes successful someday
Wow!! 😳😳 So your choices were either a market breakfast buffet OR one single strawberry 🍓 for $20...!?!? That IS luxury! 😅
Choco banana, Strawberry Milk And Fried chicken by the sea ...
A truly great place to get tasty local dishes and fresh sea food.  Went there two years ago. A friend of mine brews beer in the near by brewery a walking distance from the market.
Amazing market 😻I wanna visit there
We'd LOVE to see more videos of Rissottaro waking Chris up at silly-o-clock in the mornings, taking Chris for more PHYSICAL and MENTAL TRAINING: like climbing mountains, running parks, or even some martial arts sparring.. because as Rissottaro wisely noted in prior videos: Chris is always eating.. the belly is big.. he must 1st workout and be "hungry enough" to properly enjoy meals 😉💪
this content is made just for Chris' excuses of gettin fat
He traveled all the way to sea to eat a chicken karaage and a pink coloured chocolate Banana ! Classic !!!
And now I'm hungry...
Great channel
everyone gangsta until nintendo decides to copyright strike this video for that mario theme
5K!
Wheres your intro ????
Surprising Ryotaro didn't seem to have some interest in scheming/plotting to assassinate Chris this time. Not a slightest I can detect. Lol.
Be careful Chris, Nintendo might hit you with a cease and desist
$7 for tat milk with the expensive strawberries is pretty reasonable actually. Here in the US the store I work in sells 'local' milk with a wide range of flavors with no particularly luxury ingredients for upwards of that price if you don't return the glass bottle. The smallest size is a little half pint thing that you can't return the bottle for so it's more expensive (almost triple if you return the bottle for the bigger one) than the pint and costs as much as the half gallon size after bottle return. All it is is flavored milk from pretty much the same distance (we're in the midwest where all the dairy places are) in a glass bottle.
I don't know the answer to what's better, fried chicken or shrimp.... can I have both?
Why is this better than the BBC's Bargain Hunt while being basically the same format?
Chris and Ryotaro are Mario and Luigi in modern day Japan. The theme song fits you two well.
Ryotaro saying “giving the right judge” is now my alarm for all of eternity
Most Japanese people are just so whole
#AskAbroad Japan.
that shiba inu makes this video 100% better
I remember when I was in Tokyo and went to Yoshinoya, I had the beef bowl and loved it that much that I had it daily for two weeks. Miss it, it was so good.
Let’s all admit that we stayed for the zeal he has for that chocolate banana
Watch the video get claimed by Nintendo for Ryotaro's singing.
This kind of videos are my fav. make more videos on street food please
This made me so damn HUNGRYY
Seems Rissottaro does lean a bit more towards better selections. Although not sure why anyone would consume fish gills or cow intestines. 🥴 Sadly a sugar coated banana, kimchi and a bit of seaweed were the only fruit or veggies present 😔 Grilled, flavorful chicken would've been preferred, as opposed to fried, greasy, oily, fatty chicken..
Good to know that nylon is a vitamin!
Food Reviewer Ryotoro says: "Umami is Amino Acids."
Street meat!
Chris is obsessed with chocolate bananas! 😭
Such a British thing to do.....All this spicy and delicious meat lying around !..but naahh....I will have a chocolate banana..and that too .in  pink colour !!!
Been waiting for the video!
Sick of watching people hidding they're face sheeps...
6:25 WoW so many seafood for sen yen(<USD100) and I'd have to say its COVID season and you guys share the same bowl.....wwwww
I think you 2 should do a journey looking for the most random and rare food in Japan.
That market looks amazing, can't believe all you can get AND they let you BBQ your own food! they'd never let us do that in the US. Lol
the strawberry cake eater is now eating chocobanana oh my
Garlic Undertones. /covered in garlic
*Before they go buying* Me: I predict chris is gonna buy fried chicken or bunch of fried greasy food chris 1st buys a chocolate banana me: *SURPRISED PIKACHU* chris buys kaarage next me: see i knew it
ok youve done it...now i wanna go to japan for chocolate banana
Nice to see Chris getting one of his five a week 😋 🍌
Japanese man makes fun of a Brit for 12 minutes straight.
Ryotaro, that's not a well done sausage, that's a cremated sausage even hell will not accept.
日本語字幕付けなくなったんですか。。。？
Connor watching Chris lovingly devour a banana: Monkey see, monkey like.
"It's like a Mario!" 😂
You think you and Sharla can get away with a double whammy food video upload like that
food video are nice
The chemistry between you and Ryotaro is unmatched.
I miss Japan so much ! I would go to  Osaka and Kyoto this year ! I probably need to wait another year 😭
Fortunately, umami has become such an important thing for me in cooking. As a blogger, I think I was at a vegan cooking event in Berlin in 2014 and learned a lot from professionals who are really at home in the meat world about how to make vegan dishes a little more exciting with dried tomatoes or yeast flakes. Yeast flakes are generally such a good thing and there is also a lot of Japanese cuisine that we use for fireworks in the mouth...
I’m sorry chicken finger guy, but I have to go with Riato this time, sea food better
Much cheaper than Tsukiji Fish Market, I believed.
We need a family mart chicken video!
Now I have to make myself a chocolate banana, but it's -11°C out and I don't want to drive to the store and get bananas. Watching food stuff is not the best idea when you're pregnant 😝
This video reminds me of Chris's video featuring morning market in Hachinohe Aomori. And at that time, Chris were probably eating chicken karaage too... weren't he??
Emotional support Shibe at 8:42 sniffs a nom and watches the bowls v. closely from the distance.
Anyone else in lockdown just living vicariously through Chris for the past few months?
I shouldn’t have watched this in the middle of the night. Too lazy to raid the fridge now, won’t find anything to eat anyways. Oh gosh, now I’m hungry. 😩
Whats the red stuff on the dumplings? (they say its free) Looks like onions in a red sauce.
my favorite milkshake is chocolate banana 🍌.  Spread the word chris
I've been pretty down the past few weeks but seeing a new traveling vid from Chris really makes me happy  Happy except for my stomach 😢
i was exactly looking for some abroad in japan today
chocolate banana? chocolate banana! chocolate banana.
Ah yes, as we all know, people spend many generations to make the perfect chocolate banana; just like Sushi...
When nothing else can be done, just resort to food videos :D
I want someone to look at me like they were looking at those bowls at 8:57 ...
I would have gone for the chocolate banana too.
Chris has really unhealthy choices for his food. 😁😁
1:24 I think this is the first time I see ryotaro and chris not roasting each other, that was strangely wholesome
Abroad in Japan goes fishing
Choco bananas are the best but they meat and rice dish looked amazing.
3:38 Don't smack your fuckin' lips at me, Risottoero. I'll rip'em off.
A nice video with a nice duo. I'm hungry now. " I can feel everything"
Never thought chocolate banana would get added to one my reason to travel to Japan
Hi everyone! Early squad woohooo!!
I was concerned that because there was Mario theme hummed Nintendo would claim that the second it hit youtube
Wow
street food abroad in japan are the best videos!
I wish I was there.
My mathematical mind is offended that they spent more than 2000 each. Ryotaro went way over.
But motsunabe is the best!!!!!
Honestly would be a dream to go around Japan with Chris & Ryotaro
Watching this while hungry was a mistake.
08:42 - go back to the dog
This 7 dollar drink is made from strawberries that are worth 20 dollars each.   So they put in a quarter of a stawberry?
i want them to tour korea.
the dog at 8:45 oml
I would get Sashimi first! The dumplings and kimchee looked so tasty. Chris I want more.
I'd rather buy 8 chocobananas :D
Choco banana and a beef bowl seems a great breakfast, to me.
Hold on.. HOLD THE FRICK ON!! LOOK AT THE BACKGROUND IN 8:43!!
Love the thing with the free grills. I think it’s a nice thing to hang out together
Your choice of music in this video is really excellent! Is there a list of the music used somewhere?
Chris "I will lose weight this year" Broad
Chris's face looks a lot slimmer than when I last checked in.
I think I'd gain weight actually if I went to Japan lol, their food always looks so delicious.
When I saw those bananas I thought they were chocolate covered sausages. I'm a bit disappointed they were bananas.
Never thought I would be on your vids this early-
Why wasn’t Sharla there?
5k, that is better than most movies! Really upping the produciton quality!
the man on the wheelchair with the dog clearly knows how to live
and thus continues Chris' transition towards a food review channel.
The holy trinity of Abroad in Japan: Eating food, Reviewing traditional hotels and responding to comments. And here I am watching a man eat a chocobanana
Tsunami: destroys a market Japan locals: let's rebuild it at the exactly same place, no way there can be another tsunami in the future. No point to build it a bit further from the ocean. Ocean: am I a joke to you ?
Justice Delicious.
Ryotaro and you are excellent!  :)
F×××k yeah mate looks amazing
Ryotaro has a pretty good accent compared to other Japanese people.
She Cute! 7:58
How did you like Tuna gill? That's one of my favorites 😋
Everyone: Fried chicken vs Grilled fish Me: Why not both?
Now this is my kind of breakfast. Fuck healthy diet, hello diabetes and fat-related diseases.
Chocobanana is authentic japanese cusine
Ahhh food and Chris in the same video is one of the best combinations...
It's 12:00 get to bed silly christ!
Waiting for the next video with chocolate banana 😂 😂 😂
Risottero firing up that bbq grill while Chris is grilling him throughout the entire video~ 🙃🙃
I feel like with the right editing, these videos could be very well made Japanese tourism marketing videos.
Too much eating.  Don't become a big face.
8:42  DOG SPOTTED.
8:37 Ryotoro is single handedly going to get Chris's channel copyright struck into oblivion by Nintendo.
Gyotaros favorite dish is Gyoza
Try do it where I coming from and the only think you can get is a boring unhealthy Mcdonald's menu or other fastfood menu  -_-  and damn those look god damn good O_O
v EYE tah min
I'm in a national lockdown and I torture myself by watching food vids.
Hm I feel like it would be a Dango Breakfast for me as a vegan 😓😓
I really enjoy these types of videos, they're fun and interesting to watch 😁
Getting some cooked riced with that bbq platter and tuna gills and you probably have enough food for a person for the whole day for just 2000 yen!
Loved this video. Makes me wanna visit a Japanese seaside market too!
Hi Chris!! i never had chocobanana before, sad
RIsottoro is saving your life by feeding you charcoal sausage, it helps purge the choco-banana toxins. be sure to thank him
Last time I was in the food market was one year ago in Bangkok. It's amazing how markets in Japan are open while UK government is still holding citizens hostages almost for one year.
Shrimp Shrimp F*ck chicken  🙄
#AskAbroad #ASKABROAD #askabroad What you would if do came in you house the seen and your cheating girlfriend you or boyfriend on？
Yay! Ryotaro is back!!!! such an amazing combo!!!
7:10 The woman on the right seems to appreciate Ryotoro's cooking abilities
Seeing you and Sharla in my notifications😌👌
Glad to see you and Ryotaro doing another video together!
I want to know how the breakfast made by Chef Risottoro tastes like.
Japan is so much better than the US. I wanna be there! :(
Ah yes, the best way to reply to ppl commenting on you gaining weight is to justify it by making a street food series for their entertainment. 10/10.
Now I just need to make a react video to this and invite Risotaro as guest
umami video
I want to visit Japan so bad and go to some small markets like this. I want an authentic Japanese experience, not a tourist Japanese experience.
仙台生まれなのに行ったことない!! 今度日本帰った時絶対行く!!
It ain't an Abroad in Japan video without the fried chicken
CUTENESS ALERT! Two tiny dogs in a messenger bag @ 1:17 !
Risottoro’s back in the game
didnt know ryotaro is an emo. RAWR!
I really enjoyed you in the official podcast. Your biting sarcasm fits perfectly with them lol.
Tuna............ shit
Not fair to see this while sadly eating rice alone in my flat
This felt short.
Came for the food. Stayed for Chris ;)
Ah, classic Abroad in Japan, the simple food video to keep the channel from looking dead between other hell to edit projects. :)
That fish platter for the grill seemed like pretty good value. The chicken looked delicious too, but not sure on the chocolate banana and overpriced milkshake. Did Ryotaro kill you with food poisoning or are you ok?
You guys wear similar clothes like brothers.
Damn, thats more than enough for me 😂😂
That crafty Ryotaro taking your beef bowl!
that seafood platter is an amazing deal
"the world's worst chef Ryotaro"? I feel like there's a bit of a story behind this...
what 20$ buys you at a street food market - plus we decided to film extra! :D
Looks good Chris
ok but I would absolutely go for the chocobanana first thing in the morning too. I need something sweet to start the day right!
Chris, that vid was BBC travel show standard. Top notch engaging presentation, the food looked pretty good as well.
you should do a video where Ryotaro makes Risotto. Then Risottaro can finally become the reality we all dream of....
Totally would have went for the choco banana. 👍🏼
That close-up of ryotaro wafting the food haha
Eating in Japan was always the best time of day for me. It's amazing, stylish, absolutely everywhere and cheap. No planning required, just look around once you are hungry and pick a odd place. Same goes for drinks in sodamachines!
sorry Risottoro. Chocobana won the first dish of the day. why don't we have stuff like this in the west? xDD
Out of curiosity - do they have any vegetarian options out there or is it mostly meat produce focused market?
I never want to someone more than I want to be Chris eating Japanese street food 🤠😔
7:58 I just wanted to share to the person reading this the kireii vendor who was donning a colorful blouse  that caught my eye. ☺
The topic of this video could be "my daily diet but today on a STREET FOOD market". Sweets and chicken - Chris never fail to impress.
It wouldn't be a video with Chris, if "fried chicken" wasn't included. Honestly I'm surprised it wasn't your first dish, although chocolate banana DOES taste rather yummy.
Next video: "What $20 buys you in this Akihabara Doujin store"
That seafood bbq set looks good and cheap.
In the middle of the fkin night, of course :((
Thank you so much! Waited way too long for another street market food video
i'm a little bit disapointed that you guys did not mention the chocolate banana in this video 12/10
I would kill for some morning karaage, but maybe I should be upping my nylon intake instead.
Chris and Risottoro are my favourite host combination!
"this is really the worth" sounds like an Engrish Rimmel London advert starring Ryotaro
2:27...damn that's some seasoned chopstick splitting skills right there. if i did that, i'd have a mouth full of splinters.
He asked for chocolate banana coz hes out of ideas!
I think that Ryotaro and Connor would get along well together, with them both calling people peasants all the time.
Food videos make me so hungry here I am watching one anyways
3:22 all your zinc, copper,  nylon  ?  bruhhh what kind of food do you eat ?
I absolutely love chocolate bananas ...so nothing wrong here from my view
Blacker than the chocobanana. Shit.
20$ for a breakfast, holycow...
Poor Risottoro
Japan is such an interesting place yet half the things you talk about are food
10:49 "misshapen, distorted"  Chris, its a banana. What are you on about?   Still great overall video! You made me drool while on my bed at 11pm
Chris I think you just want us to see you get fatter and fatter don't you?
Yaaaaas a new Abroad in Japan video always makes my day 😁
Getting the notification of Chris' video while having a breakfast, and it starts with "We are about to have one hell of a breakfast!"... Damn, Chris is getting goooood at this black magic stuff! Truly an alternative theoricist's superpower.
Once again, amazing quality video Chris. Keep it up!
well thats it im coming to japan when its safer to travel just for a chocobanana.
You joking about being worth it made me have a video idea. Why not both of you go to 3 different restaurants or cafes that serve a specific food and eat that dish at 3 different price points and see which one is best? Like the show worth it on YouTube ?
"Rawr!"  -Risottaro
That looked tasty. But if I was going to drop 2000¥ at a market in Sendai it would probably be “Craft Beer Market.” (Look it up if you’re in the area.) OK, fine. maybe one then the other...
Its like a japanese food bazaar😎👍🏽
im hungry
That was hilarious and informative at the same time, well done Chris and Ryotaro!!
So that's what the outside looks like...
I think you missed out on the cow intestines, lol. They actually look pretty tasty and would most certainly would have been chocobanana status. Now we know how you calibrate things and I propose you use a banana scale to measure greatness on your future dish ratings!
Warning: watch it while eating!
Last time i was this early i was born a month and a half early
I'm here before the Nintendo copystrike
I would totally also go for the Chocobanana.
Mmmmmm....Karaage 🤤🤤🤤
i refuse to believe that chris didn't have 2000¥ worth of yakitori
Ah breakfast of champions, chocobanana and fried chicken  Would be a great place if your there as a big group
Actually, as someone who doesn’t eat meat, thanks for featuring the chocolate banana as an option for us. It did look really good 😂
Think you could use  Pete's DJ connections to get our other favourite Brit in Japan, James May, on your show?
The hardest part of this video was not picking which food to eat with $20.    It was waking up in the morning
Crazy phrases... o_0 Rissotoro starting to sound a little like Natsuki...☺
Chocobanana squad
Ah yes, nylon. My favourite of all the vitamins.
Can't wait to travel all the way to Japan from the US for a traditional chocolate banana
Hershey's chocobananas. Natsuki's worst nightmare.
Do you feel the seaweed tho😂
I love these 2 together. Also the title of underwhelming japanese super hero was awesome I almost didnt catch ot
I thought I saw Bernie Sanders at 0:50
When are you going to do a Journey Across Japan Series for the northern half of Japan?  As always really enjoy your videos!
Utterly disappointing that the highest resolution you offer is 5K. How the hell am I meant to watch that blurry, pixelated mess on my 16k ultra thin, wallpaper television at 78"?? Really ruined my day D: /S
Here in England we can’t go to the local pub
weren't they selling chicken and broccoli
Can't wait to see the next one: "Chocolate Banana, Japan's most valuable treasure".
I think the cast of abroad in japan should go to a japanese western karaoke dance club and go horseback riding dressed in cowboy outfits ......lmao  Always enjoyed watching your show and I look forward to many more .
Needed a video to watch while eating breakfast, this was perfect
Remember not use melt in your mouth.
Man, nobody likes eating more than Ryotaro. Watching him enjoy food heals my soul. Anyway great video as always, wish you both the best. P.S. The chocobanana  made me drool
I think the cast of abroad in japan should go to a japanese western karaoke dance club and go horseback riding dressed in cowboy outfits ......lmao  Always enjoyed watching your show and I look forward to many more .
I thought those were chocolate sausages! And I probably belong to the dark side because I would totally go for that. Cooked, allowed to go cold, then dipped in melted baking chocolate, covered in sprinkles and allowed to harden.
Chocolate banana not good
I'm surprised Ryotaro didn't tried to kill Chris in this video XD... Unless he tried while cooking on the grill, but we don't know yet!
How much Japanese do you need to know to communicate in an open air market? Can you get very far by politely gesturing and nodding?
8:44 nice doge
I too get all my daily requirements of nylon from a pink chocolate banana covered in sprinkles  - some nutritionist probably
Wow! It really is 7 o'clock in the morning. How did you do that, Chris?
Ryotaro has a better english accent than Chris
Imagine starting everyday with a breakfast like this
I LOVE that you provide videos with the option of playing up to 5k! Even though I only have a 1080p monitor it just shows how much effort and care you put into the details.
Imagine the notifications actually working for once.
But does any of it melt in your mouth?
Someone turn 0:44-0:45 into a gif
Im obsessed with Japanese cuisine, we always make ramen at home but i need to try the real deal
Always fun to see Ryotoro and you out and about being a bit silly.
BUZZFEED JAPAN
Damn, i definitely want to go there. I feel like, the life in each country is better experienced in those local places rather than in luxury designed for tourism. But thats just my subjective pov =].
*I want some and I’m jealous*
Another video of "Stuffing ourselves in Japan"? I love it!!!
Now I am craving a weekend market meal!
This is heaven for hung over people
8:45 Ryotoro's Mario theme is pitch perfect. *DMCA INCOMING*
It feels so weird, seeing such a lively market and people almost cuddling with eachother, whereas here, everyone is always atleast 1,5 m apart from eachother, which makes ques quite big :D
$20?? We can't all eat like kings you know..
Let me explain umami in more "applicable" fashion than a shitty subtitle that chris put. Just grab any MSG from your kitchen and shove it into your mouth. Thats umami flavor.
chocobanana
that gyudon made me hungry... and i just had dinner!
Those bananas look so good
Too sweet for me in the morning. That beef bowl looked good.
Yooo 16 mins ago, I’m early for once 😁
If "Eating Across Japan" is not the main show this year, Im going to be so disappointed
Me watching 5k video on my 1080p monitor
Describes umami: ... amino acid 🙄
I made it 18 seconds into this video before having to pause and get some food.
Risottoro has tried to kill Chris like 10 times and he still only gets the title of 'underwhelming Japanese villain'. The idea of what Chris considers a proper Japanese villain scares me.
Abroad in Japan!
If you see this you're early to this absolute masterpiece! (just like every single other video on this channel)
Chocobananaman in Japan!
Banana for scale.
Ah yes that most famous of Japanese dishes, chocolate banana 😔👌
Watching this while I eat my sad cereal. 🤤 😭
Banana!
But.... wasn't that way too much Mario theme music? Won't Nintendo hunt you down and destroy all your hopes and dreams now?
It's nearly 9AM here in Alabama and you have made me very hungry. Wish I could have some fried chicken but I guess frying some chicken nuggies will have to do. Chicken nuggies and a salad...chicken nuggies IN a salad! Mmmm!
I haven't eaten in 10 hours. Nothing beats willingly torturing myself by watching a video about delicious foods when hungry.       Except maybe that chocobanana.
Starting the morning with a chocolate Banana 🍌 classic Chris
Mmm amino acids
did you say nylon is in bananas???? you have just offended every chemist on the planet. 😂😂😂
😁I just woke up and I'm hungry now and I really want a chocolate  banana
Daaanngg in  Germany a chocolate banana costs like 4 euros! The heck?! I was born in the wrong country ! And the German banana doesn't even have sprinkles T.T  Edit forgot for a minute I wasn't born in Germany but oh well
Me : I bet Chris want to eat chocolate banana for content  Chris : Kick off your day with chocolate banana
Inb4 risottoro gets Chris copystriked by nintendo with his perfect pitch, all in his master plan to take over the channel
Man, craving that beef bowl! My fiance can have the intestines :p
Hands down the morning Japanese food market videos are the best!! Good to know there are a decent amount of them around still!!
I just ate dinner... and now I'm hungry
Watched this in 480p like the worthless peasant I probably am.
Featuring Chocolate Banana.
Risottoro anyone?
OY! OY OY OY I'M BRITSH
You know something weird is gonna happen when Ryotaro is in it
Damn look at Ryotaro technique at 2:26, must have taken him centuries to perfect it...
So I only just noticed this, but theres a 5k video quality option. I swear Chris just choose it to show off
There's always money in the banana stand
Yes, I eat bananas everyday for my daily dose of copper and nylon
I don't see Chris eating those intestines
Whoo. Earliest I've been on a video: 13minutes after posting. Awesome.
I'm going to have to visit this place when I go to Sendai.
Chocobanana is life
Never been this early to Abroad Japan video
Proud to be so early! We love you Chris!
The underwhelming Japanese villain really outdid himself in this one.
Lived in Japan for a few years, you should check out Honcho "The Honch" in Yokosuka. You can easily get there by going to Yokosuka-Chuo station
I see Ryotaro I click. Sorry not sorry Chris.
2 words for this video  choco banana.
It been a long time Ryotaro didn't show up finally he's back :)
Sorry Chris, but I'm just going to wait for a Japanese person's reaction video to this.
Do bananas have feelings?
5k Video? Yes, thank you!
Two men once in the land of the rising sun One of "tuna shit"  The other of Banana stick  History will remember this.
I'm pretty convinced that this is a food channel by now
I would love something like this in the US, but alas...
Take Natsuki to an Otoboke Beaver concert.
Gotta love these seaside Japanese markets. No scams, no haggling; just honest, friendly vendors, fresh seafood, and chocolate bananas.
That little Ryotaro dance with him carrying his fish made my morning!
This is really the worth!
Amazing selections. Just delicious, if this food was alive, I'd want to be とまだち with it. I know this is a terrible comment nevertheless, I just thought it would be nice to say regardless.  Regards, Link start. しおなら。
Another food video again. Control yourself Christopher smh
Bloke!
Don’t underestimate the nutritional value of nylon.
It's always a good day when we get some new Abroad in Japan!  I would kill for a nice morning grabbing delish snack foods with my bud!
Chris only releases bangers
yeah, vitamin nylon on bananas
Ah yes, not only one of the healthiest foods, but also a Japanese classic, *CHOCOLATE BANANA*
I just want to jump into the screen and eat the food
Heheeee, I can't get over you guys playfully roasting each other! 😂
British guy living in Japan uses DOLLARS for currency WTF Chris?
Did anyone else see the doge at 8:44? Dogecoin to the MOON
Promised to call my mate back in 5 minutes, guess that's not happening now. Thanks Chris mate.
Ah nothing  gives me more than seeing Ryotaro again
I had just finished making Gyoza when Chris uploaded, like it was meant to be
CHRIS I CHALLENGE YOU TO HAVE A WEEK TOUR WITH RYUTARO
1:44 Rissotoro reminds me of a dolphin
I guess there's always money in the banana stand.
Does anyone know what breed of dog that is in the background @2:51 ?
Just when you thought you knew about Japanese food, then comes chocobanana. 😆😆
These videos are basically just Television shows on Youtube, thankyou Abroad in Japan
Risottoto looking fresh though
how do you always find the worst foods in the markets where ever you go?   also, it is great to see them recover from the disaster
Come on Chris don't show me all of this amazing food in this incredible place while I'm stuck in the UK eating such basic food...
hold on a second, is he pronouncing karaage kinda weird?
Risotoro eats food. The movie
Chocolate Banana, Fried Chicken... Doesn't sounds Japanese. Doesn't sound breakfast either. Pathetic!
look yummy
Don’t lie, Chris, you know you spent more than $20 there! Lol
Barbecue seafood for breakfast 😳
Chris: “You can have the first taste, cuz I’m nice” Two seconds after he shoves a plastic bag in Ryotaro’s face 😂
4:40 sounds like Uncle Roger is nearby
Watching a Japanese man eating juicy dumplings is awakening something inside me.
How does the Chocobanana compare to a banana from Bluth's Frozen Banana Stand?
Am I the only one who's surprised that breakfast market is even a thing? To me this is wild
A video from both you and Sharla (and me! :^ ) ) in the last 45 minutes! Today is going pretty good. Bananananana and Chicken Karaage are a solid win for me.  6K quality though next week please, I'd like to taste the food too :^ )
Eating again I see.
aw u became a big face again
RYOTARO GIVE ME THE VIBES OF JACKIE CHAN LMAO
そうか、東北は緊急事態宣言は出されてないんですね。いいなあ
This video is really the worth~  Thanks as always Chris! Waking up to see a new video from you is always a joy!
Look it's the famous Youtuber Ryotaro from Ryotaro's Japan. Ryotaro is so humble he brought along Chris to help his much smaller channel.
Nylon LOL
Omg more content 😍
Chris and his absurd rating is the real never ending despair
Kimchi is Korean :)
I am not surprised by the fried chicken as it is your lifeblood.
Let’s goooo also loved the podcast with the grease monster himself Charlie that was great
Bold prediction: this video will be very very popular
How long is that place open? Because I can see myself eating there for 7 days from morning till dawn
"of course I'm worth it!"  It's 6 am and I'm going into today with this mood
Ryotaro, not the hero we need but the hero we deserve
Justice Delicious!
I think I messed up. This video isn’t over a year old 🤔. Idk what to do?!?! 😳
i literally just ate homemade grilled meat, and youve made me hungry again.
Thanks for the content Chris! Helped me through quite a bit of quarantine!
Japanese gyosa and korean kimchi. Nice!
I just want to say that I agree with Chris: Fried Chicken is better than Fish.
Ah a video with Ryotaro in it..    *_Worth Video Indeed_*
I don’t know why, but Chris choosing the chocolate banana makes me happy 😂
can't say enough how much i appreciate your videos. They are extremely nice to relax and unwind to
hello random strangers of yt
Can’t wait to see these vids with Charlie and the boys in it🤧💖
CHOCOBANANA!!
“What he can get and what I can get and he’s gonna get some shit and I’m gonna get something good!” 😂😂 classic ryotaro
I love to get nylon with my bananas
<3
Finallly
I'm watching this in 480p. I'm sorry 😌
I want a Chris Broad food travel show
Love these kinds of videos!!!
Can anyone start grilling at the market? That's seriously awesome
you know the problem with morning markets?  its the morning part...
2 minutes and already around 130 comments lol, haven't been so early on a abroad in japan video lol
That doesn't look very covid-19 safe
RAWR!!
i didnt know ryotaro's nickname was 20$, you learn something new everyday
Having to get up every morning to go stuff my face at this market would probably fix my sleep schedule.
Woah 5k Abroad in Japan, my eyes have been blessed
New Abroad in Japan video? Immediate watch.
Chris I just saw you eating a veggie burger what is going on WHY ALL THE FOOD? D:
仙台市民ですが、閖上の市場は行ったことありません。
This is amazing! In Denmark you can't get half of that for $20
*Olà* *Soy dora*  *My personal favorite food is puppy ramen.* Read more
Love the video❤️
Ryotaro looks so happy destroying your meal. Clearly brings him great joy.
George Japan was right, 480p is the way to go for enjoying Chris video
I think this is my first time being this early on AIJ video
Let’s goooo
Great now I am hungry
I would aprocheat it If you would make a Video about Cats <3
Notification Squad

On another note, I'm actually impressed your not huge, you must work out a lot, because you're vids always about eating. Either that or off camera you never eat
Praying for the day, that I can return to Japan and eat all the lovely food showcased here and everywhere else!  HNNNGGG!!! HANGRY! >:D
99 comments within one minute? Wow
i always get so hungry watching  AIJ 🍜🍱🍚🍙🍣
Is it more fried chicken for breakfast? Keeping the Abroad in Japan tradition alive.
Last time I was this early was never...
I'M GONNA REVIEW THIS VIDEO
I love your food videos! Also your videos made my friend who visited Japan back in 2018 and hated it, want to go back now. Because there's so much fun stuff to do!
Breakfast for lunch and for dinner!. Also markets in Japan 😍
Hey Chris! Can you make a video about the living standard in Japan? According to different professionals and different salaries.
food
Nice, just in time when I finished cooking
I am a simple man. I see food in Japan i like
Up at 7 o'clock?   That's all Ryotaro's fault! XD
288 likes and 8 view Epic(never gets old )
How much for a Risotaro?
Oh hello early Bois and girls
Damn 8 views
8 views and 79 comments? hmm
And I just had a maccas bacon and egg muffin and hash brown for breakfast 😂 Y’all eating like kings!!
Now this is proper
Have you ever experienced food poisoning in Japan? I’m always paranoid to eat food I haven’t prepared myself since I’ve had food poisoning more times than I can count.
いいね
8 views and 195 likes. That's how Abroad in Japan do.
Ryotaro and Chris are the best food market duo (or maybe rivals), if thats a thing
Damn seeing this 50 seconds after is was posted is a new record for me
Amazing video Chris, I love these videos, they are great information and inspiration for what to do in Japan :D
That's worth the 20 Dollars!!
God I’m hungry
you getting fat
Are y'all wearing t shirts atm??
Nice👍👍👍
Hi Chris wassup
Wow lucky me.
Early squad, bros!
おいしそう！
Chris why do you like food to much and how do you keep thin from eating all this food
Nice another food video time to grab a bucket for my watering mouth
When the notification actually works  and tells you about the video on release and not 4 hours later
Hi
NOTIFICATION SQUAD: Don't deny it. You wanted the chocobanana. If not chocobanana, then what else would you CHOOSE from our selection of six delicious dishes? ALSO following on from last week's video complaining about 480p video, we've upped the ante this week by releasing this video in 5K! (Whatever that is).
Nice ! Great Food & Later some Foookary
#ASKABROAD what was the most awkward interaction you ever had with a foreigner in Japan?
Thanks for the video.. makes my Saturday evening more fun =D.
When the world needed an abroad in Japan what 20 dollars can get you in Japan street food market
Finally a new vid
Finally! A new video!!
Never been so fast to click a video
Asian Street food always the best
I miss Japanese street food so much lol
Ryotaro jigging the first few seconds makes this video 😂
20 seconds ago,,, 👁👄👁
Damn I miss Japan .... Thank you for your videos
Hey Chris, I'm starting a Street Food Series. What's your favorite Japanese Street food I can make?
2nd 3rd doesn't matter your fan from India
7AM? I'm assuming you just didn't go to bed yet.
Haven’t been this early since Chris was looking for Mount Fuji
I've never been this early to a Chris Broad Video. This is epic
Love you Chris ❤️ Always excited when I see a notification pop up
Consistent uploads?
Ben Shapiro’s wife is a doctor
Notification gang
I like this channel
This is the highlight of my weekend
I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!
Must say that's a hella lot of food :) love you Chris!
Watching this early enough to eat breakfast at the same time!
One day...
Arsenal is losing again. DEPRESSING!!
Yeah
Moar food!!!!
B Road on it
Couple of pieces of fried chicken innit.
Nice video again Chris!
Notif gang lets go
legend
No matter how much Chris hates every living cell on Ryotaro's body and vice versa, they always make the most entertaining food/travel videos on youtube.
19th
Just finished Sharlas vid and Chris uploads. It's all planned!!!
👀
