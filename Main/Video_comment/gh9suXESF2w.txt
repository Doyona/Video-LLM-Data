Its not the same without Tommy
It feels weird without Tommy  💔
THEY SHOULD HAVE WON!!!!! Tisha is right.
I LOST IT HAHAHAHAHAHAA @1:31
They should start a category for past series that deserved an Emmy but never won one. Martin till this day is considered one of the greatest sitcoms of all time. Never even being nominated was a tremendous diss to that cast and crew.
Wow ….HOLLYWOOD sucks whale balls definitely….how could you fudge that up!
That's YT Amerikkka for ya! & a different world 🌎 never received their nomination.
I say boycott them til they give up them Emmy’s to those highly deserving who they overlooked
❤❤❤❤❤😂
R I.P Tommy
To be truthful I would not care if I ever got a Emmy I'll just be glad people enjoy my work majority of the people that have those either their old are there not working after they get it 🤣 and when you're dead and gone people will forget you because something new will pop up and generation changes 🤔
The Emmy's need to do a special category for the 90s tv shows, and that cast of the Martin show should win for best 90s sitcom.
I love these times as a child. I wonder how many ppl in today's day would line up at a time portal just to go back during these times. Even if you weren't born yet.
RIP Thomas Mikal Ford...
Pam is not aging well. Her body is tight but that face been through hell
Poor martin.... Not the martin from def comedy jam
If they had an award for still relevant, Martin and Fresh Prince of Bel Air would every year.
No RIP for "Tommy"??
Not one martin and pam insult we was all waiting
It's alright. We know they should've won one, and we all know why they didn't.
Martin and Fresh Prince definitely deserved Emmy awards!
#1 RIP Tommy #2 I know they rewatched their old episodes of Martin to replay their former characters
Cole aint changed Lmao!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why didn’t they get an Emmy?
Cole looks EXACTLY the same! ❤ his beard just changed  colors a tinsy bit.
Martin still holarious to this day. Def in a huge part of my childhood.
I mean what is a Emmy anyway.. it’s a community that gave them their flowers when the showed aired ✊🏾 no show no matter the color has been better..  Emmy’s ain’t never been anything but a white award show and they don’t acknowledge blk actors actresses enough
tommy’s picture broke me! i’m so glad they included him ❤️ rest well tommy!
slavery vibes
“Martin” barely said a word in character 😢
Where bruhtha man at?
Reboot / Sequel it!
This show could’ve gone on another 2-3 seasons. Tisha and Duane ruined everything with the false accusations
I don't care what anyone says, he's still Cockroach to me
I heard Martin du du on himself. That’s  y he stiff.
Awkward
I dnt watch awards but what was the point of this reenactment ? Did they win an emmy??
It’s All Good Martin & Crew Y’all still making us smile & proud✊🏿🖤
Aww🥹❤  I swear Cole is the funniest 😂😂
This some BS they just gave Ted from Cheers a damn Emmy last night (2025).
In case nobody said it RIP ❤ Tommy
Instead of Anthony Anderson, it would have been extra iconic if Bra Man or Traci Morgan made that entrance/ interjection
I mis Tommy
That’s why we need our own awards. They had FRIENDS (It’s a business).
Gina's sexy with her big head😂👍🏻🙏🏻 nah im kidding, her heads perfect. Love her smile, ger face. Martin was a great show
Martin is greater than awards he has the people
Only thing missing was tommy with that big laugh,  and one of his lines ending with dawg! . R.i.p to him. Love seeing this again.
I’m sad to see Martin getting around so slow smh. I just watched some Martin clips and it’s crazy how wild and animated he was then and how he is now is crazy!
People in the audience laughing like they been watched the show, yet it was never honored or even nominated...smh.
Humiliating to be presenting after all the years and success of Martin and STILL not receiving one. Humiliating
I miss them like fr reboot same cast
So glad they have tge pic of Tommy front and center
I love Martin because he is so funny and I love him so much!
This show deserved an Emmy nomination during its run also now there is a 2nd Spinoff of this show coming to BET+ starring Tommy Davidson's character and I'm excited.
RIP TOMMY!!!!
Rest In Peace, Tommy.🙏🏽💗
Martin ain’t even standing next to his wife 😂😂😂😂😂
Only the cast of Martin could get away with throwing shade at the Emmys during the emmys 😂😂
Sad what happened to Martin. He is not the same.
This show was better than Seinfield and Friends.
It’s amazing that they rebuilt the Martin set for set just for this 2:30 minute skit
I didn’t watch Seinfeld on Thursdays in the 90s. We were a Martin house…
Damn it was weird hearing them say Carl and not COLE ! I was expecting a slip up !
They all look BAD
If Tommy were still alive, they would've been saying "You ain't got no job, man!!"
Anthony comes in a is the corny part lol
Love this show so much man! Forever banger and forever iconic!
Still watching this banger sitcom to this very day!
Great show need more like it
Martin seems off. Something in the voice.
I love when they are playing the character of Gain walker and Martin Payne Pam Cole Payne now they real name is Tisha Campbell Martin Trichina Arnold and Carl Anthony brown ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sit down and stfu if you wasn’t listening to your jealous ass husband we would’ve had way more episodes and seasons
Idky I expected them all to age way better. Before Tommy died he was also unrecognizable. Any explanation as to why Martin's face is so swollen?
was waiting on bruh man to come out the window
may the work that they done speak for them individually I’m a 90s baby and still to this day I still watch the episodes❤❤❤❤
You can tell Martin has moved on.
R.I.P. to the guy who played Tommy
Anthony Anderson Joined Martin Lawrence TV Show Awards
The committee who run the Emmys  should give Martin tv show, A lifetime achievement award.
where brother man at
Damn, that may be Martin…. But he not MARTY MART
She seems real calm for someone who claims her harassed her
0:42  Cole, you stupid 😂😂😂😂
I love their chemistry and I hope they get the honor and recognition that they've worked SO hard to earn!!!
Martin was the funniest show in television history, I've watched it countless times and it still has be busting up.
The Martin Cast Of This Greatest Sitcom TV Series Ever Martin Lawrence Tisha Campbell Tichina Aarnold And Carl Anthony Payne II
Well that was very painful to watch.
Is Martin a clone or did he have a stroke? He seems off.
I love this show forever and ever  For me the are Genius Humans  Actors and actress  Still watch in Neflix  They are my winnersforever  And   This show is People Ganadores  Nunca habrá un show Como este  Especially NO habrá Nunca another Martin LOS AMO ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Thanks  you for  de laughters  ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Did martin have a stroke?!
I love Martin…the show is now on Netflix and it’s soooo nostalgic…good ole days in the 90s
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I think we all know why....... but it's all good
Black-ish is that perfect mix of Martin, The Fresh Prince, and The Cosby Show all in one.  Good having that interaction there
What’s crazy is some saying this wasn’t one of the best shows on tv. I bet mad folks who watched and now in reruns can quote mad episodes.  What’s crazy is some folks saying Friends is one of the greatest when they literally ripped off Living Single which was a helluva show in its own right.
Big Momma’s House reunion. You got Malcolm (Martin), Nolan (Anthony Anderson), and Retha the woman giving birth (Tichina Arnold)
apparently its not just me and a lot of other people noticed something wrong with martin's health. his family "dispelled" the rumors saying hes better than ever. Ok, in my professional opinion and yes im a pro at this so dont start this crap where you see who has the bigger you know what, but in my opinion, hes absolutely got something going on. People think it was a prior stroke and it may be but i cant rule out drug or alcohol use. Something in him has been going on for many years now and ive been seeing the changes. My red flags went off like the 4th of july any time i see him in the movie commercials for bad boys or live. I love him as an actor and wish him the best so i hope whatever it is, hes getting the proper help but its been a long time so something has to change
I thought the thong song was ready slap at the beginning yall! Sorry!
I love how even while doing the Emmy's, the Martin cast called out the Emmy's for no nominations. Hollywood knows they are wrong.
Where bra man
😬😬😬😬😬
Facts
It's crazy seeing them in character, but calling each other's real names.
Still one of the best shows on TV today 2024❤❤❤
“Wooo! Wooo! Woooo!”
We all know what Anthony Anderson was about to say why Martin never got nominated or will win an Emmy. He knows "BLACK-ish" shows dont get nominated or wins.
Why did Martin seem slow? Is he ok?
Hope martins okay seems off
Martin seems off……that’s NOT the Martin I remember
Never received an Emmy!? That’s not even right!! They better give them one right now!  RESPECT! ✊🏾
All we needed was Tommy’s yeahhh dog! Phrase. R.i.P
"im leaving here w sonething"
Won't ever move on these ppl are stuck here why you want this white trash.. These trophies and throw away shit you cant take with you to heaven when you say you love the the LORD. I get it fair is fair but you're fighting for their garbage make your own brilliance you have the money and power now why do you want what they have or want ir hoarder ill gotten gold. Now you're the fool too
Idk What It Is But Martin Is Different
RIP Tommy ❤
Top 5 comedy shows of the 90's to me are *Martin* *Family Matters* *Saved By The Bell* *The Wayans Brothers* * In The House*
*Martin* and every last one of them deserves an Emmy for Martin the hit tv show. Arguebly the greatest or the best comedy tv show ever and definitely its the greatest and best comedy tv show of the 90's.
Martin didn't look right like something was wrong with his speech
Me waiting for bruh man to climb through the window with an Emmy in his arm for Martin ask him where he got it from and he say he got it from the back.
RIP TOMMY! You ain’t got no job!
Martin made me such a proud Detroiter! They definitely didn't get their just due.
Rip T he would be proud 🕊️🕊️
Tisha is a natural
Even the CROWD was shocked after Tisha said how many shows they did without ever being nominated
Im not feeling this. It's so sad we can see how they sold their souls.😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
I need the Rent-em Spoons hat.
no maam.. I didn't appreciate this one! The Emmy's got them mocking not, getting an Emmy! How degrading! YOU AINNN'T GOT... NO EMMY!!
Where's Bruh man!
Best funniest show ever!! They deserve this plus much more for their talent and providing great entertainment ❤❤
Tisha looks like a perfect-princess she is soo pretty!!🥰😍
Like the previous post...if only Bruh Man would've ca me out
What were they thinking with this mess?  Colossal waste of time.  And no Shanaynay?  Jeesh.
I never knew they weren't nominated 😮...thats awful...thats show business for you
Not the same without Tommy.
The 80's and 90's had so many GREAT BLACK programing. FOX and UPN AKA The CW were started with Black programing until they did not need us. A lot of Black programs did not get the notoriety and now today, they want us acting like....N's, B's and H's.
MARTIN IS STILL ON AIR TODAY! They DESERVE their Flowers & More!
For some reason their presence feels disingenuous. Virtu signalling and diversity cookie points.  They ignored them for so long. Not nominations, not even honourable mentions or shout out throughout the years. Now that the Issa Rae, Quinta and Ayo are creating great comedy on the shouldersof Martin, they're pretending like they care. Mind you, black led/created shows are still being unfairly cancelled
Tisha Campbell is a Scientologist hahah
So they made the dialogue and set for them but no Emmy. It’s like when they have a pizza party at your job but not a Raise.
My heroes
Oh I love this so much! ❤💎
Rest easy big Tom even though we still don't know what you do for a living🙏🏾😂🕊️
I just love how after Martins show. Both Tichina and Tisha became female leads of my other 2 favourite shows 😂
@1:41 I was enjoying myself until that lameass cry baby walked into frame. Fk that whiney ass beotch.
Achievement Unlocked: It's a Crime
Both ladies still look good ! 🫶😍
I was waiting for Bruhman to come through the window and grab a Sandwich
Tichina does look good ! She’s my moms age
If Bruh man walked in that would of been. WOOWW😅😊😅
Damn Carl still looks hella young and it's been like 30 years!
Unfortunately, a show can only win an Emmy if it’s mainstream and has high crossover appeal with the “majority”population. Even if EVERY black person faithfully watched the show, it wouldn’t be enough to win an Emmy. You know the Emmy’s is like the Oscars, but for for TV….and you know how hard it is for a black person/movie to be nominated for one, much less win one.
Why do I still want to do Tisha? She was so hot back in the 90s
Martin looks like the 70 year old deacon at a black church
Payne just glad to be up there - he was working on a used car lot for a living after Martin.
Where is Stan?  Garrett Morris deserved to be there since Tommy is gone.
Martin show deserves ALL the awards there are on this planet!!!! THE BEST & the Funniest!!!!! You Go BOYYYYY!!!!!😘🎉
Smh shame on the Emmys but recognizing
Everyone looks good!
shoot, they are a game at family reunions and fresh prince of bel air
Martin was funny .Shennae nae was funny to.
I'm not shocked they only white people on television
I love the lowkey message to the Emmy's and Anthony Anderson brought it home.  The truth almost slipped out.
Martin show is so legendary My niece who is 7 years old today watch this show every day before school and every weekend so no matter if this show didnt get a Emmy this show is still winning generations wealth
Rip Tommy I know you’re looking down and smiling from heaven daaaawg!!!!!!!!!!
Damn is Martin alright.?!
Rest in peace to Tommy ford 🙏🏼 this was one of the best top5 sitcoms!
That not Martin or Anthony
Wears bruhman
Why does Martin look like a black Biden lol
If Bruv man from the fifth flow would had have came through the window that would’ve been tuff 😂🔥🔥😊
Tisha forever fine 😤
Stop saying "Martin should've won an Emmy" or "I'm SO SURPRISED it wasn't nominated..." Emmy awards was never for us.
wow that canned laughter is creepy af.
Where's Brotha Man with his sssaaaammmicch .
Begging for validation, when black folks already gave it to you. SMDH
Rip Tommy
The left must not realize the amount of gay and fat jokes that are in Martin. Show was hysterical.
Oh man l was really expecting a Tommy shout out, Martin show was The best
Very shocked that my FAVORITE comedy show of the 90's was not nominated... LOVE MARTIN !!❤
All I know is that this show has aged well, and is still entertaining! I had no clue they weren't recognized back in the day because I was a child.
Maybe he is just gettong old as hell😂
Great video I put it in my watch later and finally got around to it.   I haven't seen a vid that actually gives cooldown times and numbers that gonna come in handy.   Keep up the great videos!!!!
Who else would have been pissed
Jay and Rochelle 🔥🔥🔥
Wow, took damn near over 25 years for Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell to be on the same stage after burying the hatchet from years ago.
Rip Tom
Tisha never dissapoints.  🌬️ 🎂 Wish she would record mor r n b records .
This shit is CRINGY black people we have to have more Integrity and Pride than to let white people downplay are talent and make a mockery of us!!!!!!🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
Where's brah man!!!  We're missing  brah man
This brings back so many memories! Martin  y’all should’ve won an Emmy in the 90’s. I hate that the Martin never got a reboot. This show will always be one of the greatest shows ever!
That’s pathetic. These awards show are so fake and rigged that’s why nobody cares to watch them
Tracy Morgan aka hustle man should of came out trynna sell them a fake emmy award
RENT EM SPOONS 🔥😂🔥😂🔥🔥😂🔥🔥😂😂🔥
Martin looks good physically. Keep it up Bruh, stay healthy.
Martin gets skinny then big then skinny again
Rip tommy
What’s wrong with Martin?
I was steady watching the window for Bruh Man.
They killed it 😂😂👏🏽
Martin still plays every single day on TV. The more I watch it, the more I feel bad about the loss of Tommy. He died when I was in high school in 2016. It sucks so bad. RIP to my man Tommy. The show is still hilarious.
What in the hell was Tommy job? 😂😂😂
What the fuck is this? This just feels off?  They don't even feel real .... Martin doesn't have that Martin energy ..
Shame that Dragonfly Jones & Shanaynay couldn't make an appearance,....classic!
After In Living Color Stopped the Martin Show took over the rest of 1990s. We owned that decade on Sitcoms and then Def Jam on HBO
Rip Tommy. I so agree they should’ve gotten an award.
Rest in Paradise Tommy Ford....
You know it's a good show when you can still watch the reruns 30 years later and not get tired of the show and even more it's embraced by a totally new generation.
That’s how they do people of color. Don’t give us our due til we are old or dead. Wendell Scott the racer is probably the worst case.
I love me some Martin movies, blue streak, national security and black knight, I could watch that shit all day long and nap to it, so comforting
Emmys begging the black for attention 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is Martin Lawrence okay? He is completely different now. Lacks energy and enthusiasm. Like a total different person
Was a great show!  Anthony your show was crap and racial
Mar-TIN
I was waiting for Martin to tell Anthony to step.
I never liked this show growing up, but this was pretty cool 💜
TISHA CAMPBELL LOOKED BEAUTIFUL 😍😍❤️❤️ LUV HER ❤️❤️👍👍
I didn't watch it in the 90s. And I'm not a fan, now. I guess for what they were trying to portray, then, ok. I don't find the show, funny.
Tichina and Tisha carried this skit
Idc what y'all say rent em spoons was a great idea 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tell me you want a reboot without telling me you want a reboot! lol
I can hear Tommy now screaming,  "we bout' to get an Emmy doggggg!" Lol RIP Tommy Matin still one of the best sitcoms up there with Married With Children, Living Single, The Cosby Show, Fresh Prince, Good Times and the Jeffersons. 💯
For a split second i thought brothaman walked in!
The Emmys next year needs to give an lifetime honorary achievement award to the show MARTIN: the cast, the staff, everyone involved 💯
Much Love From Detroit ❤️💯🎉
I miss the 90's. So happy I went through those eras. Great times.
Shout to whoever in charge for dropping the ball on "Martin" not receiving an artistic award for one of the best tv show runs during its time on air. people choice & Naacp award is all its worth to those people who cant relate or enjoy black art.👏🙌
Some thing is going on with Martin health wise I can see it in his face. Praying for him 🙏🏾 love this show and always will! Grew up watching it!! ❤
Martin, looks like he's not well
Tommy finally at work. Working for the lordt🙌
Is Martin okay?
Surprised they didn't make him wear a dress 👗
Martin why you didn’t bother Pam and broad man from the 5th floor didn’t come frm the window
They dnt need no Emmy wat they did for the culture n...shit for my life is priceless
*Everyone in the comments shocked at how they never got nominated*  *Me on the other hand shocked at how he looks like his other character big mama*
Still funny 😂😂😂😂
Tisha Campbell is sexy as hell in this clip!!!
They really needed Bruh-Man in this scene! Should have him come in thru the window!! 😅😂😂🤣🤣
Love the gloves Tisha is wearing
That “hmmm” from Anthony Anderson spoke so loudly 😢.
what is wrong with Martin he looks sick or something.....smh look at his face
This was cool, but it’s just not the same anymore.
My favorite show of all time!
The picture of Tommy! 🌹 RIP
I remember when I saw Tommy in Randalls. I was upstairs in Starbucks and couldn't get downstairs before he left.
Love that they recreated the set & everything! The nostalgia! 🤞❤️
am I the only one who thinks that the emmys having them there to just present an award and not be there to at least accept an honorary one is the biggest slap in the face?!?! Highly Disappointed and Disrespectful af if you ask me. smh
Used to watch this show as a kid on the carpet both feet kicked up now i will be 42 this year...8 years away from a half a century smh....an uncle just passed away in hospice an hour ago....life is truly short and special ...GOD BLESS EVERYBODY
My grandkids watch Martin we love all holiday episodes❤❤❤
They should get an Emmy master raft awards🎉🎉🎉
I Ca Not Beleive they Never won An Emmy sooooo insane🎉🎉🎉
"Rent 'em spooooooooooons!" 😂😂😂
Tommy not here dont feel same bro
Maybe you would've won an Emmy during your run if YOU didn't quit on the show.   ty
❤
martin not wearing the dress on film tonite?
I ain't gonna hold you, when Anthony Anderson came out and said they weren't getting an Emmy, I was hoping Martin was gonna tell him to "get to steppin".
Dam Gina still fine as ever!
R.i.p Tommy
Man I remember having the biggest crush on Pam
Thought the Thong Song was about to come on in the beginning. Got amped as hell like Okay Emmys!!😅
Martin about to drop d3ad do you see how he was walking and shaking lol 😂
Whats wrong with martin? He got meds in his system
No zingers at Tichina Arnold, though??? Aww....
Aww, the picture of Tommy sitting on the table ❤🥺 he’ll always be with us. S.I.H Tommy! 🕊️🤍 I’m trying not to tear up. I miss him so much.
Martin looking like an old black dress shoe.
See this is us as black actors not like the ones who love too tear other black actors down. Y’all know
Gina/Tisha practically ruined the mans show.
That was a stupid 2 minutes. They went on stage to complain and try to make it sound like comedy? Pointless
This is everything!! Now y'all just need to make it official
Guide damn Cole 🥰
It should have been the Cosby show…..
It should have been the Cosby show…..but if it wasn’t for Bill
Woah
They should got a emmy they look great though r.i.p tommy
What did they do with the real MARTIN?
Is Martin Lawrence okay? 😢
this is amazing. I love this
Gina proves here light skin still poppin, I know Martin still wanna hit
Martin shaking and talking like Joe Biden 😂😂. I love Martin though. 1 Luv
They got an Emmy in my heart...they were the 90s TV for a while. Good funny and always on time.
Damn why Black don't Crack??? They ALL still look the same. ❤❤❤
Martin always look like somebody ruined the party. What y'all do to Martin. Martin had a light in his eye, loved to laugh, love to write and perform. Young black men wanted to be as cool as Martin. What y'all do to him. He always look like "I'm over it. I'm tired. I'm good". Someone or something stole his spark.  Lemme guess. Envious white people and back stabbing desperate black people working for massa
My heart ❤ one of the best parts of my childhood
Y'all don't need an Emmy. The show was great and funny and still IS. Y'all  hilarious as hell and y'all run was great...P.S THE EMMY'S NEED Y'ALL 😂
Tommy Ford RIP He wrote motivational story books for kids growing up in gang ridden neighborhoods
It’s weird watching this as I’m watching the show Martin right now. It’s amazing how much time has passed 😊
Carl is on point, in character, and himself at the same time. He hasn't lost a beat. Amazing comedic talent
I know he's getting older but Martin seemed like something was off.
i was waiting for bruh man to pop out of the window
At least Martin ain't in a dress..The gate keepers letting him be a man for once
Bring back Shanaynay.
Why do martin look like a small Cedric intertainer😂
What couldve been?!! The reeboot shouldve happened 15 yrs ago. Its a shame it didnt.
I love Martin Lawrence, the rest of the cast & Martin tv show. It’s a timeless tv show that’s hilarious.
The show will never die you can watch it over and over and it will still make you laugh it would have been nice for them to get nominated but I think they know fans know there all winners in our hearts I watched this show all the time with my mom she passed so this show will always bring back a memory thank you for the countless laughs and I still will be watching even with my 2 year old daughter
It really was. Better than Seinfeld, better than Friends. It’s almost like they stole the ingredients and tried to recreate Martin without black people 🙄
Greatest Sitcom of all times no doubt. fresh prince is the more popular but Martin is the more funnier. Comedy sitcoms goal is to be the funniest.
Love our Emmy awards love us martin 666😈😈😈
It wouldve been nice if Bruh Man appeared!
Carl’s “Rent ‘em Spoons” hat is too funny 😂
I was waiting for Martin to kick everybody out! lol!
RENT EM SPOONS!
Cole was on POINT like he never left
Big Facts ❤ this show one of the greatest imo 😊❤😊
Martin up there actin like a black BIDEN... Like where m i... What do i say
Anderson ruined the moment. What a busta
Where’s bruh man from the fifth floor??
Martin was so emotional about them on the Emmys, with Tommy gone, it was so unreal. Let him have a moment, he was happy but overcame the Tommy needed to be there. He was Martin Lawrence, keep well
I could go on, the Brian McNight scene, the Lottery, the Wrestling episode, the dead plumber, the baby scene. Martin a fool, I did not know he had a stroke. Thank God He is here and well. I love them so.  Martin just know you got fans, you all should have got a Emmy.  God bless. Its coming, trust
Better than Seinfeld and Friends
I still watch them. This show I watched them all, I was at home. My grown kids watch this and laugh. I cannot tell you how this show made me so happy. Pam is still Pam on everything I watch, still funny. If Martin had to call her beadie bee one more time, I would have hollered
❤❤  Marty. MAR ❤❤ Everyone looks. GREAT Towards the end i realize TOMMY picture was there ❤❤    RIP. TOMMY
The show Martin should've won an emmy.
This is so funny I really miss this sitcom 🥺
What did I just watch smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
The best black sitcom to ever air ❤
Rent Em' Spoons!!!
They literally could've gave them one for the heck of it....
Tisha Campbell fucct up the bag wit her dirty shady ass smh
what's important to recognize is, the receipt or non receipt of an Emmy does not change the IMPACT of this show.  even at this date, the utter hilariousness of many of the episodes (featuring Martin's numerous characters) has waned very little and that folks is worth MORE than recognition by some "object" called an Emmy.  that's right, if you're still laughing 27 years after the show's gone off the air...?  well there's the "AWARD".
For their show to have run for that long they should have been nominated for best something at least
Good Times was way better than Martin! Especially the theme so!
I'm not shocked this show was a bet kind of a show where I kind of expected it to be B level not compete on the level of actual Networks but I understand where people's frustrations come but you get typecasting once you show up and you're not on an actual Network that's like we're blackish is on that's just how it is
They needed Brother Man to climb through the window
Tischina arnold is right, her body is still off the charts 30 years later
Heaven forbid the black version of Friends get ANY kind of recognition for their ratings or popularity up till this day.
Rent 'em spoons!!!!
They dont make legendary sitcoms like this no mo😥
I still wanna smash Gina 😈! Child hood crush
Martin seem a lil off 😅😅
Never realize how much of a hole in the cast that's there with Thomas missing even during the reunion show it just feels incomplete 😢 also WHY THEY NEVER WON A EMMY??!! That's ok Bruh Man knows cuz "They Called Him" 😂
Jeez the coat martin wore in the intro on the rack such disrespect
that aint no daaam emmy! lol
Martin has not been the same since the 90s you can tell he drinks. Hes just not there. Which is why he couldnt say much.
I used to love Martin growing up
why Martin look like his character in the movie LIFE?
Dam they bring in Anthony and it’s so true,so much in that segment smh
Why isn't Bruh-Man on stage with them ? lol
They deserved it back then!
Fantastic! Glad the Emmys recognized them for their work! I hadn't noticed the picture of Tommy on the table at first.
MY GOODNESS.....THEY LOOK FANTASTIC!!!!
❤MARTIN*LEGENDARY
Lmaoooo Cole ass ain't changed at all 😂😂😂😂😂 and it does suck that their show didnt get the recognotion it should have. That show was and still is the bomb.
Something Seem Throwed off W/ Martin
Bruh man should’ve been coming thru the window
Is Martin ok though?
I was waiting to hear his "wazzup?!"
One cant look at the cast how they are today and say the show was bad back then. They were very good back then. In fact so good that FOX network put that young Black cast and show in the #1 prime -time slot as their top dog to go head to head against every other metworks #1 show in Sunday evening  prime-time veiwing slot. Fact. They were that good.
Greyhound bus 🚌🚐
King Leonard 1040
Continue to rest in peace Thomas small I wish you could be here to see this
Wow
❤️❤️❤️
I think people are really starting to understand just how good we had it back then. TV from the 1950s to the 1990s was the golden age and with politically correct weakness it's never going to be that good again
Gina shouldn't even be up there. She's the reason the fkn show ended, following behind Duane Martin's jealous ass. I know Martin won't say it but I bet he hates how she's up there acting like everything's all good between them.   SN. I always thought Pam would've played a better Gina.
Nothing but jealousy and bittermess from the Emmy's to not have them win at least ONE all these years. Martin is easily top tier television.
Don’t try to get this Show No Emmy when we start losing the cast 😢!!! Give them their flowers now R.I.P TOMMY 🙏🏾💯
So happy they made up! Its a beautiful thing. (And that picture of Tommy) Tear to my eye.
*Tommy was at work*
Is Martin ok? It was good to see the cast together again.
Tommy my boy!!!   I need that not having a job reference!
Loved this show growing up and still do. I hope Martin is okay
Maaaan i wish Tommy was there!
They all looked great!! Sorry about the Emmy Awards...Shameful!!
Not right without Tommy
Man, on everything, I still cry laughing at every episode like I'm watching it for the first time.
Martin and Gina! Together again! Wow.
*Me online looking for Cole’s Rent Em Spoons Hat*
Tichina said "not me gurl" i still look good 😂😂. They all look great ✊🏾
Too me... this was cringe😅
This show was funny, we can still sit around and talk about any given episode and crack up while reliving it. (That frozen pizza, Shenehneh giving Myrna a pedicure, Martin after the Hearns fight.) OMG! 😂.😂😂(Thanks for the laughs and memories.)
Tisha still looks good, "Spanx" or no.
Martin isn't feeling it. You don't need an Emmy to be a good show.
Anthony with that strong “Hmmmm” Like you know the answer bro 😒
Jerome in the house😂😂😂😂miss this gem of a show
Cole was the only regular one in the entire skit
I want Gina to apologize to that man
OMGGGGGGGG I MISS MARTIN !!!!!!! PLEASE BRING IT BACK !!!!! WITH KIDS OR SOMETHING IT DOESNT EVEN MATTER !!!! BEST SHOW EVER !!!!!!!!!
RENT EM SPOONS!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“The Hood Phenomena” - Kanye Voice
This kinda made me feel some type of way because you don’t need they recognition. He don’t need an award his well know from his movies and show. Without that award
And the show is still funny no matter how many times you see it!!! They really should have won one

Saying Seinfeld or friends was better that martin is.....something but opinions opinions 🤷🏾‍♀️🏃🏾‍♀️
No WUZZUP is crazy...
Martin slimed up
"Bruhman" should have stepped in ........ with Emmy for the show!
Honestly I’ve watched both Martin and Seinfeld.  There is not reason one should have gotten one and the other didn’t.  The both follow the same formula in terms of sitcoms.  Seriously go watch both shows and compare the structure of characters and how the story progresses to plot points.  Both are great shows but The Emmys is a joke
Is Martin sick or is he just talking slower with age?
Damn wish Tommy could have been on that stage.  Would have loved to hear Martin say “You ain’t got no Emmy Tommy!”
Why did they cut it off like that. It’s like they edited it be lame.
They didn't accept black entertainment then. It was just something they capitalized off of by stealing their ideas and making shows from. Good example, F.R.I.E.N.D.S being the white version of Living Single. They're learning now, though.
Gina ruined the best show ever 😒 Martin got a bigger than me
They def should’ve won period rip to Tommy
That stage aint the same without tommy's loud ass laugh😢
Ssso very funny 🤣 lol
Did the emmy’s just play in their face like that???!!!! 😦Or am i missing something? 🤔I thought this was a joke & they were really going to give them one. 😢SMH. Can’t believe they had them do this lil skit AT the emmy’s just for them to be presenting & NOT getting an Emmy their self. “I” would’ve been flipping all that furniture over. 😂This was disrespectful to me, for them. I’m pissed. Lol
Don't feel right without Tommy 😢
😂😂😂😂 Never b another AMAZING show like this. No matter what, they r all emmy winners..ALWAYS! RIP Tommy. 💯💯👏👏👏💖💖😍😍💃💃🙏🙏
They don't need no Emmy to validate their greatness! Everybody knows that cast and show was the Best and still is. I'm watching it right now cracking up laughing
Felt like we was watching an episode with the audience laughing
Racism and prejudices are clearly the reason this show never received any Emmy awards. Also these wonderful actors was prolly pure at the time and never bent over to any perverted executives. Have to do strange things in order to be apart of fame!
Is it just me or does Martin seem off
My favorite zitcom of all time! R.i.p. big Tommy.
The rhythm of that show is so imprinted on my mind that after Tichina said “I still look good”, I literally was expecting an affirming line from Tommy…RIP. Legendary show and cast chemistry
Why did it cut off when Martin started talking?
Oh shit the gangs back and they all look amazing. That's rear. Thank god they left Shanaenae home.
Martin my favorite show of all time
RIP Tommy💖 Glad to see they paid homage to him with his picture on the table.
🎉🎉🎉Awesomeness
Martin his show should’ve had several awards it’s sad that it was never nominated ever. Martin spoke up his show as he should This is one of the greatest comedy shows and still one of my favorite shows of all time from the 90s and in one of the long run in shows, and still running on TV this present day 2024 Martin and his cast deserve their flowers 💐 💐💐💐👑
Classic show don’t you know no gooood😂😂, where was brother man from 5th floor 😂😂
Loved this show. ❤ doesn't need an Emmy for me. It's part of life memories.  Emmys can provide that. 🎉
Until we REALLY realize the table was never set for US...we will always be frustrated and feel disrespected.  It's ok to make our own table....and make ours inclusive! Some creativity....others will never understand and treasure...but we know!!!
Martin doesn't look well 😢 he looks like he had a stroke 😢
Everyone looks good!! I still watch Martin still this day! RIP TO TOMMY!! (You ain't got no job man!!) 😂😂😂😂
PS Tichina Arnold’s work on Everybody Hates Chris and the Neighborhood is also worthy of recognition for her evolution as a comedic actress. Brilliant!!
Fuck the Emmy Martin and Seinfeld are the greatest shows of all time.
Damn my man Martin getting old.. but blessing at the same time ..
The recognition of Martin as a cultural icon of the 90s by the Television Academy is long overdue. Mainstream media made the cast of Friends and Seinfeld megastars while snubbing the casts of Martin and Living Single the blueprint of those shows. Martin Lawrence, Tisha Campbell, Tichina Arnold, Carl Anthony Brown, and Thomas Ford (RIH) were a brilliant cast, and the writing was unmatched. I personally believe Tisha Campbell is also long overdue for recognition as a lead comedic actress. Her work in both Martin and My Wife and Kids was masterful. She is the Lucille Ball of our generation. Nevertheless, thank you for cementing them in television history at that moment. Watching that segment was the only reason I tuned into the Emmys.
Swear I'm from an alternate universe where Carl Anthony Payne is the "III" instead of the "II".
R.I.P Tommy WE GOIN MISS U DAAAAAWWWWWG
Martin looking like Tisha pepper sprayed for sexual harassment. 😅
Damn it, Tommy!   You aint got no job!!!!
It’s beautiful to see them all together after all these years. RIP to Thomas Ford. 🙏🏽
She left the show...why is she there
Did Martin Lose weight
It's obvious why they didn't get a nominated gazelle probably outside any other show still BS
Rent em spoons hat 😂
They also should have come to the UK
Why did that man come out & say they will never get an Emmy? Was he trying to be funny? Did I miss the joke?
132 eps what😮
My god I loved this show😂😂..still do....a classic😂
They could’ve gave them more time than that
And we still dont know what tommy did for work😂😂😂r.i.p
What’s up with Martin? He on the at wet ?? 🤨
I love that they have a photo of Tommy in the middle of the table. R.I.P Thomas Mikal Ford
My favorite tv sitcom of all time. If Martin was not in your top 5, then you are boring!😂
Didn't Tisha have a restraining order against Martin at some point? I hope they've resolved their issues. I loved the show back in the day! Give them a Hall of Fame or Emmy!
They aint never received a emmy and tommy still don't got no good man🤣🤣🤣😂😂 I wish they could all still be here
Racism is real and those who live through it have hurt Black people in every way imaginable. Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
I’ll never respect Gina ruined possibly the greatest black show ever
Tisha Campbell single handedly destroyed the Martin show.
Where was Bro Man??
All this “honorary” rigmarole
Martin show never won an emmy?
Cole with the animal sounds❤️. They haven’t changed
Martin will always be one of my favorite sitcoms ever. I still have seasons 1-4 on DVD!
Tommy would have had that laught, miss Tommy
I was waiting for bruhman from the fifth flo come through the window to tell the crowd don’t worry about him but he’s going to fix himself a sammich and then bounce. 😂😂😂
Only show I bought on DVD set. Ever.
It's it just me or...👀.... Nevermind
Fox didn't even treat them well after they were renewed or made 100 episodes. Black Hollywood stays getting 💩 on
because why they not got a Emmy???
Martin use to be so lively. 30+ years ago he would've told Carl "eh sitcho dumb butt down" (trying to keep it PG). But he was quiet and stayed in the background while Carl, Tachina, and Tisha drove the monologue... something has been off with ML since Big Momma House. Brandon T Jackson pointed it out and I see it
Much Love to these guys!
That's just another reason why we don't really care Emmy's
R.I.P Tommy
Martin was unusually quiet and slow or am I tripping?
Does anyone remember why Tisha left the show in 1997? She sued Lawrence for sexual harassment and won. The guy destroyed his show and career because of drugs.
Carl Cole same difference 😂😂😂😂
I STILL watch this show almost daily and I still LMAOOOOOO so hard I wake my husband up but he gets it. One of the. absolute BEST shows to come out of the 90's, best 90's sitcom couple, and such an amazing cast. RIP Tommy Strong!
I see lots of inflammation in Martins face 😢
Martin deserve all his flowers🎉
The energy and chemistry is off. Martin seems unwell
Why wasn't Tommy there oh he had to go to work
Couldn't even upload a complete clip
Good seeing you guys and the set. But we were also waiting for, “Bruh Man from the fif flo” to climb thue the winda. 😂 Everyone looks great. ❤
Man tishina campbell process martin Lawrence for abuse in the series martin 😅
Weird.
It's hard for me to pick btw Martin and the Cosby show
Something looks wrong with Martin  Gina looks old with a bottom tooth missing Cole has aged well  Pam looks old
My favorite show of all time!!
NOSTALGIA ! THIS YALL BIG ONE! Thank you for you contributions to BLACK HISTORY ❤️❤️❤️🫶🏽🤞🏾❤️❤️❤️
Tichina Arnold still look fine asf
Why was Anthony there???? He fucked up the magic
Martin looking bad
A tribute to Martin where Martin speak for 2 seconds?
Rent Em Spoons was a good idea.
All black lol cringe
Tommy❤❤ I love how they comedically threw shade 😂😂😂
RENT EM SPOONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be honest it's just how it was. I never even considered that a show like Martin qualified for the Emmys 😂. Black shows were never considered mainstream, and honestly that gave them more freedom to be spontaneous, wild and original, while being tremendously underfunded. We just accepted that the Emmy's weren't meant for us. As long we knew how we felt about those great shows, that's all that mattered.
Martin looked a little off...
How the Emmy's acknowledged something without acknowledging something
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The applause was shitty they deserved better
My brother would almost pass out from laughter watching this show. Family friendly too we could watch it with our mother. Top 10 greatest shows of the 90s easy.
Martin looks sick
Martin seems tired
Wheres Bruh man?😢
Tisha Campbell still sexy
*Your not going to get an Emmy*  *BECAUSE THEY WERE FAKE*  nobody got one lol
"i still look good."
RENT EM SPOOOONNNNSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Wth happened to Martin????
Look at junk in the trunk, big head and Carl.
This looks awkward and embarrassing to do because did they rven get an award after?
Prayers to Martin and his health..he looks off. 🙏🏾
I still can't believe tommy is gone...
When she asked why and he replied “mmhmm…” we all know what that meant 😂
Miss Tommy man, but at least our brother finally got a job… he’s an angel🥹
It's so sad and crazy that that show was on so long and never was even nominated nor even one of Emmy it shows you that America is still a racist there is absolutely no excuse why they wasn't even at least nominated
That monkey sound was unnecessary to me
Where’s Tommy 😢 ?
The Rent’em Spoons hat is the best part ❤ We miss you Tommy!
Is Martin sick again? He doesnt look well
Wish they would've done it in character! Best sitcom of the 90's!
I was waiting for bruh man to come through that window
now days, it appears that Emmy awards are being giving it out freely, they might have extra Emmys laying around.
They should have surprised them with one Emmy each. That would have been epic
I think there was supposed to be a loud applause when Anthony Anderson walked in
The Emmys FUMBLED THEM SO BAD ALL OF THEM MILIT TALENTED THAT SHOW WAS ONE OF A KIND 😢
Can we get a revival?
Damn can brotha man come through the window and give my people their overdue Emmy or nah?
I always felt Martin was never the same after he ended up in the hospital/coma after his heat stroke scare. Considering he almost died as a result of it I've always wondered if he suffered some sort of minor brain damage. Since Run Tel Dat you can tell something was off and would continue to be off about him. His slower delivery, the energy, and his speech was concerning. Stumbling over words and slurring at times since that date you could just see something was going on. Even now when you look at the rest of the cast and their energy on stage its like its 1992 again, with the exception of Martin. I'll always love Martin and still watch it on HBO Max to this day I just hope he stays in good health.
Love  the pic of Tommy on the coffee table
RIP Tommy
Nefbp = Noemmy for black people, our shows don't measure up to their counterparts & this show was watched all over the world. It hurts to see Martin after his stroke but he's still here & all glory to GOD & maybe he'll write & produce another comedy show because he & that crew was really funny, where's hustle man & bruh man from the 5th floor? 🤣😂🤣😂
R.i.p tommy
I still watch today.
The Emmy’s board should be 🤬 ashamed of themselves. The skit alone is just pitiful. Especially if they didn’t give them an honorary award.
We all know what he meant when he said you “know” why. SMH. When is enough, enough?
Why does Martin move like "Papa had a Strokie Stroke?"
Cringy lol
Dang they did all that and still didn’t give them an honorary Emmy. SMH
Why was Martin so low energy? He barely said anything 😢
Tichina ain't lyin. *Still fine as ever* with them Pam Yams
How in the world did that show not win an Emmy, not even nominated ??? That’s insane!!
Awkward what wrong with martin is he alright?
Influenced a whole generation
Love this
That was AWKWARD ASF!! 🤔
WOW!  Marty-Mar drop those pounds!!!
We ran Martin back over the holidays and cracked up the entire time! They definitely should’ve gotten one! Sad to see Marty Mar don’t have the spunk he once had but love to them all❤
Martin was pose 2 be like wizz up wzzz up wzzzz uppppppppp hes sick and u can see it ....maybe cuz Tommy dead ???
I feel terrible for Martin. Hes a shell of himself. Hard to see him slurring and in this state of mind. Knowing he will never be the same.
You know they were being racist for  never even nominated the Martin show. That show was hilarious and very well written.
Greatest Sitcom of all the times!!! 💯
Did he just say,momma dee 😂
"Nah I still look good."🤣🤣🤣
RIP Tommy
Kinda weird of the Emmy’s to do all this stage set up and stuff only to highlight how rigged and bias their whole set up really is… I mean they could have at least presented them with a honorary Emmy or sum thing while they were up there
Sanford and son never won one either. Pure travesties
Random People: *Where is Tommy?* Us: *He's at work.* Cast of Martin: *Tommy ain't Got No Job!!!* Tommy in Heaven: *I do now.* 😇 RIP, Friend. We felt your presence. 🥰
Black TV carried the networks back in the day
Best sitcom ever. Hands down.
Fuck that they should of won every year there's no show on now that can top our 90s sitcom they was the best
It's so good to see them.  Martin was one of the greatest shows ever.  This show never winning an Emmy is unbelievable.
I love them man❤😂💯 definitely should've won an Emmy. It's a great show til this day ❤
They should’ve at least played the infamous Tommy laugh or sumthin
Tisha still suck…… wish she was never on the show
Rest in Peace Tommy
The fact that they  instantly made it feel like the Martin Show……  Wow.
😢😞☹️Tommy💔🫶🏾💪🏾
Much love to Marty Mar and the rest of the crew!
I’m surprised they got Martin to be apart of this
Happy for them and this moment.  It needed to be had, and Anthony Anderson was slipping into telling the truth.
Where's the rest lol
That was cringe 😬
I watch it everyday
Martin got the lil Wayne cheeks (pause)
This is one of my most rewatched shows. Love this little reunion.
I need one them Rent Em’ Spoons hat
How embarrassing to even have a skit to high-light the Racism of the Emmys. Disgusting!!  The Emmys need to become absolete.
Wow! Martian could had done so much more!!!! I would have loved to see him go in on Pam again…Genna set him up for it….😅
What a treat to see Martin Lawrence…..and also that sequined motorcycle jacket !
Martin looks like a ghost of himself. It's like they sucked the life out of him.
1:32 💀
That’s Hollywood for you, not to even nominate the Martin show!
R.I.P. Tommy
I'm 33, this is taking me back to my childhood 😊they're aging well
The thumbnail alone makes me happy
This was dope & mad bittersweet too for several reasons
Yeh but they started losing ratings and people weren’t watching the show like before cause it was repeating the same jokes the ratings were down that’s why it cancelled but still was a good show used to watch it in the 90s
Martin Held Fox together and was the highest rated show at the time...believe it or not Blade saved Marvel from tanking...what do these things have in common...no praise given for [insert] excellence.  Sounds about right...
Bruh man from the 5th flo (or whatever flo he was from because he didn’t know) shoulda come out the back eating a chocolate Emmy, asking “y’all looking for this?” 👀 😂😂😂
Gm...cåR...{iykyk}...✨🤍✨
I think Martin may have Parkinson's or something similar hes speech is really slow and he seems spaced
RIP Thomas Ford....Damn 😢
They should've gave them like 3 Emmys  last night!! This is the funniest ever sitcom ever. Extraordinary talents...
No Bruh Man?!
Tommy had to work.... for the Lord.  R.I.P 🕊️
Who is that rude guy who checks in towards the end? Not cool.
That’s a clone of Martin
This would make a great musical, RIP TOMMY!!
As a proud 90’s baby I had the pleasure of seeing a lot of incredible comedians, actors and entertainment in general. Especially from my people. The fact that the ‘Martin’ show has never been nominated or given a Emmy is BS.    I feel like there’s a growing consensus that the ‘Martin’ show is the Greatest sitcom of all time. And I won’t see to it until the cast members get their true flowers and they’re presented an award or get the proper recognition for that show being the best. Better than Friends, Seinfeld, and any other show that get mainstream media recognition. 💯👏🏾👏🏾
Martin to Gina's mother in season 3: " & I Saw Another Side Of U Too. When I Climbed In That Bed With U Tha Other Nite!!!! "😂🤣
Martin talking real slow as if he had a stroke. Hope he’s alright.
Was a good show. Never expected tisha to show up based on what she accused martin of
I still love Martin till this day. I still have my all seasons DVD collection I bought years ago. RIP Tommy Strong. I never found out where you worked though 😂
Dam the tall brother died r.i.p big man
Gina and Pam could still play Gina and Pam so effortlessly
How disrespectful not to mention tommy or have a huge picture of him.smh This was corny glad i dont watch this ish no way.
Culturally iconic shows one of the best comedy series of the 90s
I’m impressed how they replicated the original set!🫶🏽🔥👏🏽🔥
Cole is still great 😂😂😂
Rent ‘em spoons😂😂😂😂
😂🔥🔥😂
Martin on ozempic we stan
Season 2 of Martin is the greatest season of television ever made. RIP Thomas Mikal Ford
what the hell is wrong with Martin?  he didn't even try to get in character or be funny.
RIP TOMMY!!!
Martin don't look all that well
That’s a nice picture of Tommy❤🕊️😊
Martin been under mk ultra since he had that episode waving a gun saying they was trying to kill him "" and they Did👀 Took the real martin soul now hes in a sucken place 💯
One of the funniest shows EVER on Television, and Zero nominations?  That's just criminal.
1. R.I.P. Tommy (Ain't got no job) 2. Those ratings, the popularity at that time,  NO NOMINATIONS?  NEED I SAY MORE?
Gina overacting per usual.
lol that ain’t him 😂
It hurt me to see.  He's definitely dealing with something physical.  At least he's out and about and not still hiding like Jamie Foxx.
Carl? Cole….wtf
So martin lawrence sucked dick for fame???? Damn katt……..
We all know this show was too black for them but for that reason that's why I LOVE IT and it's still a cult classic to this day! Honestly it didn't need the award because it's still being talked about after decades of not being on. My 11 year old niece and nephew even love the show so it will continue to be a hit for future generations!
Love it 🖤🖤🖤🖤 RIP Tommy 🌹💜
I love Tisha Campbell…I have always been a fan of hers 😀
Martin doesn’t wanna even be up there.
How are you going to bring them to the Emmy’s and not give them an award🤦🏾‍♀️.
That’s not Martin. That’s somebody with his face.
Where's Bra Man tho? He should've been climbed thru the window right now!!!
Man everyone looks great. Especially Martin. Looking exactly as he did on the last season episode.
One of the best comedy shows 💯💯💯
It's a damn shame seeing ol' Marty Mar like this. 🤦
Damn Cole and PAM still look the same. The other ones…ugh, how bout those LAKERS?? 😂😂….Martin definitely look like a Pop-Pop
Martin looked and vibed like he was defeated
WUTZ WRNG WITH MARTIN 🤔
The Martin Show ... The greatest show ever on television!!! We never missed an episode growing up and I now my own kids know the episodes by heart.
I still watch Martin every day when I get up on VH1 and BET at night. Will always be a classic! RIP TOMMY! 🕊️
This was awesome. RIP Tommy Strong. I missed his laugh. 😢💔🙏🏾
🤷🏽‍♀️
They deserve an Emmy!!! Give them their flowers!!! How is it that Friends got numerous Emmy nominations and 4 wins?🤷🏽‍♀️
THEY WERE TOO BUSY GIVING ALL THE AWARDS TO SEINFELD & FRIENDS. HOW BOGUS!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
RENT 'EM SPOONS!!!  I need that hat
I wish black actors and actresses stop pandering to whiteness. Stop seeking their validation! As of being validated in our own community isn’t good enough!   You’ll never see any of the white actors and actresses wishing to get a BET award, Black Reel Awards, or a AAFCA Awards. They don’t ever try to get a black audience. So stop selling black culture to white people like we need their validation for our self worth!
The only reason I would watch the Emmys or any award show is to see the cast of Martin, Jo Koy or Ricky Gervais. Without those amazing people it’s just boring.
Martin should have got an Emmy! He created so many memorable characters. I lived for this show. I grew up going from foster home to foster home and the only things that I looked forward to was watching Martin and Arsenio.
Still need white approval?
Just an Ignorant Show altogether
This is my absolute favorite show ever and it doesn’t make sense 😢
Is Martin sick?😢
I’m shocked the Emmy’s did this 😅 they be paying black shows dust
The Picture of Tommy is CLASS personified
It jumped the shark in the middle of season 4 where the reflection episode plays on the DVDs. Everything before that was the funniest show ever and after it was almost all trash. If you stop watching at the reflection episode where Tisha hosts then it's perfect. To this day nobody has ever come remotely close in side characters like Dragonfly Jones. Nothing close to as good. It destroyed everything.
All the 90s sitcoms nominated
the elephant in the room was indeed that Tisha Arnold still looks great
I see Pam finally fixed them buckshots lol
Rent em spoons!!!!
I LOVE IT😂❤!! MY FAVORITE COMEDIAN OF ALL TIMES...REST IN PEACE TOMMY...MARTIN LAWRENCE IS MY GOAT!!...&THEN I LOVE EDDIE MURPHY. I NO PEOPLE THAT'S 43 LIKE ME WILL PUT EDDIE MURPHY FIRST..BUT I LOVE BOTH❤(MARTIN IS JST MY GOAT)..
Brotha Man and ShaNayNay😂...another show we loved but got dealt dirty by the networks
From Houseparty 2 Martin! ❤
This was corny
Martin look like he hurting. He old but he walking like an old man in pain
Love this Show! But Martin seem off. I hope his health is well .❤
"Martin Lawrence slurring his words." What on earth are people talking about? He seems all good and lost weight too.
Where is Shenene?
Total Woke Sh*t-Show. These LOSER AWARDS HAD BARELY 4 MILLION  VIEWERS IN A COUNTRY OF 332 MILLION PEOPLE 😂. Nobody wants to see this TOTAL CRAP!  I didn’t waste my time and haven’t for decades but BOYCOTT ALL PROGRAMMING ON THE FOX TOILET BOWL NETWORK that showed this DISGRACEFUL indoctrination event🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮.
❤️❤️❤️
No emmy... white politics
I love how they have Tommy's picture on the table.❤
Im in tears❤❤🎉
That’s it?
This was a bit awkward. I love Martin the series, though
"Martin" was one of those shows that made your stomach hurt because of all the laughter it brought. HILARIOUS. I miss those days.
All that Martin did for the culture still don't change that he wore a dress to get there smh... Thank you, Katt Williams for stayin' real
Tommy, there would’ve been icing on the cake and Broman
Bcuz it was an all black cast and white people controlled who won Emmy’s then and now—Iconic show.
The Emmy’s is a joke. The greatest TV show ever, “The Wire” was never nominated for a Emmy, neither was the greatest comedy TV show in the 90’s. Anthony Anderson said the reason why they never win without having to say it.
I swear to God I thought Tisha was Juju Bee.
That's how it was back then. That's why they created the NAACP Image Awards because for the longest the main awards did not recognize black excellence in tv and film. They have 4 of those, and nominated a lot more.
The fans will always give y'all your flowers, r.i.p. Tommy we miss you brother.
Do y'all really care to win their awards that they don't wanna recognize u in 🤔
Martin's face looks swollen ( like tht one boxing episode w/ Hearn)🥊🥊
Tommy was funny af in Class Act
Tisha needed another dress option
Greatest sitcom of the 90s. Seasons 1 and 3 are my favorites. RIP Tommy and Nipsey. Shout out to Stan, Shawn, Brother Man, etc
Martin looks weird
Martin is starting to look like Life Claude Banks
The way they had Martin in those dresses you'd think he'd would have won something.
Cole
Best Show Ever!!!!
Gina fine ass
I thought Martin was gonna tell Athony to get the steppin 😂😂
the show and cast will always be classic. love them. RIP Thomas
It’s a FN shame MARTIN Show never got a Emmy or nomination…… WTF was that about ?
Tommy's jacket on the rack😞. What a subtle and sweet tribute.  "Tommy ain't got no job,"  but Mr Ford certainly did his job well.  Rest easy, Thomas Mikal Ford
I really love this show Martin. And I watched every episode to the end. But one thing I noticed Tisha Campbell is one of the main reasons why the show ended, but she’s always taken over like the BET reunion, and now the Emmys always taken over shut up girl..😂
WHY THEY DIDN'T WIN AN EMMY WTH
RIP Tommy. And where was Bruh Man?
Ya deserve the best comedy lead emmy😂 tf  funniest oat
That is not the real Martin smh
The reason the show didn't win an Emmy is because it's too urban and black. Let's keep it real. Thank God I wasn't up there with them, because I would've told it like it is.
Yes they need a Emmy dammit
Masonic puppet!!!
Everyone talking more than Martin is crazy
After her lawsuit. She foul for this.
Martin looks oooooolllllddd
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE WINNER, THERE STAGES AND APPROVAL WILL NEVER MATTER.  WAKE 🆙
Where's Martin's Energy.. he just stood there..am I missing something..no jokes for Pam..no WASSUP!! Is there still tension between him and Gina?
It’s not the same without Tommy 😭
What's wrong with Martin though? I am worried about him. I have never seen him like that.
The Emmys aren’t really made for people of color. Because if they were most of the awards would be one by them. Just keep it real. It is not a level Playing field. Mind you, everyone is talented, but there are winners that weren’t as good as other people, movies and shows. It’s lightweight Disrespectful to have them come on and present, but not win one after all their accolades.
Tisha Campbell looks amazing! ❤
Y does Martin seem like he's deteriorating
This is sad this show should’ve been nominated
Martin Looks Like he Has The First Stage of ( PARKINSON'S ) --- Super Sad
I was hoping to see the dude from the show sneak in through the window.
I was waiting for BruhMan to come through the window.
The disrespect that the Martin show never got nominated for an Emmy!!!! The disrespect!!!!
All that’s missin is some Sheneneh
Martin energy is really low. If he well?
"A tribute to Martin" only took 30+ yrs lol
Martin looks tired😢
But you know what was missing... Brother Man, from the fifth floor
Maybe if Tommy ever had a job they would've been nominated....
Emmys trying to fix their racist wrong doings. They are about 30myears too late.
martin seem half dead smh what happen to him he should be sitting at home
Best TV show ever 📺 ! Tommy we miss you doooooggggg !! 💕
Yes Pam you definitely still look* good
Gina😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
132 episodes sounds so low for how long it actually ran on air
BrahMan definitely should have come through the window, they blew it
Yeah, it was one of my favorite shows of the 90s, my favorite Martin alter ego was the mechanic I forgot his name, one of my other brothers was Otis the security guard and that Karate guy.
I don't like this at all. Hollywood played them. This is so disrespectful to me when in fact they should have won an emmy but to know that they are not going to win an emmy and allow these people to let them do a set like this all because they are presenting an award. I think these people did this to them so that they can get more people interested in this corny award show. It's a stupid show sorry. Martin is the G.O.A.T along with the whole cast. Just plain disrespectful
Where is Sheneneh Jenkins? The original Woke pre- Madea.
I think Martin is developing Parkinsons 😢
Best 90s show period
Pam does [still] look good.
Tisha and Tichina are still fine as hell!
One of these greatest shows
😅😅❤️❤️This was mines and my daughter’s favorite show we never missed episode EVER !!!! Much love to the cast of MARTIN show we miss you Tommy God bless his soul 🙏🏽they deserve to be rewarded for they’re had work I still watch this show its a classic forever!❤❤
Pam still got it!!!! Gina too! Cole dumb asl!! Whas you wit marty maaar!!????
Martin a legend
Had I known they were going to make an appearance. I would have actually watched the emmys this year
I have watched this several times and wonder why no one in the comments are questioning why they did this? Was this suppose to be a protest of some sort? It would have been better if Brutha Man would have shown up with some Honorary Emmys to give to the cast. I needed to see more and not feel like this was a waste of time. I mean they set up a whole set to do nothing. Am I missing something here?
An award doesn't seem to mean anything these days anyways, awards should go to statistically proven watch time, not diversity, but just the usual ol Americans who sit down with their families and actually watch what they like, thats how awards should be given, not the color of anyone's skin, but the content they put out that the majority of people want to watch, and i never missed an episode of Martin growing up, many of their catch phrases were how my friends and i communicated.
Now if they could've just had "bruh man from da fif flo" climb through the window and make a samich. Or Sheneneh knock on the door... 🤣😭😂😂🤣
Tsss Tommy not being there just hit !
Emmy is for white folks they rarely give our black ppl anything smh rip Tommy
Word from heaven “Tommy still ain’t got no job”
Emmy show go back and give what’s theirs how can ratings not factor in that’s Bull Shit White people this was the black peoples version of  friends but way funnier
Rest Well Tommy.
Martin and New York Undercover =  GOAT shows of the 90s.
Top 3 show of all time.
Not the rent em spoons hat😂😂😂
i love how they shaded the hell out of the Emmy’s. unapologetic!
That show is STILL funny! But just goes to show you these award shows don’t justify what a good show is!
Best show ever!!!
Winning an Emmy is for the boujie folks. Martin show was such a raw show so they had excuses why they didn't choose them to win. That's like giving an award for the actors in the movie Friday or giving Brandy an award for her role in Moesha. They don't support black shows. There I said it. If a black actress plays in a white film or plays the role of a slave, then they get awards. It always depends on what we do. But overall, Martin is a good show.
They cloned Martin
There should be a category for best classic shows STILL in syndication.
Nah...fuck the Emmys for this. That's an absolute FACT! Disrespectful to have them do a skit about how they never got shit but still use them for ratings
Tommy is looking down smiling   & still ain’t got no job
And thus is why we have to have our own award shows!
This Show Kept Me Alive Mentally 🫂 In Some Of The Darkest Times Of My Life 🫂💓🫂.. Laughter Heals 💕💕💕 Blessings 🙏💓🙏🏿
One of the funniest shows ever and Wyatt Guy still be like “Who dis?!?!?” Bit they like the ‘Living Single” rip-off ‘Freinds’ —-man, if Hollywood don’t get dafiggout my face!!!!!
Nor was married with children maybe married hit too close to home
Martin show do need nomination
Bruh Man.. Where is Bruh Man? 😂
Dam all of them aged good,they almost lost the same especially Cole.
Back then we already know why they didnt get a emmy....check who one instead of them .....and there ratings wasnt even close to Martin!!!!!!!!
Martin looks so damn out of place man ..........
Cole you STOOPID
WTF WRONG WITH MARTIN
Martin lawrance isnt a vibe anymore sadly 😢
Everybody looks old now, time has flew
So no Sheneneh 😂😂
Smh pip Tommy man it’s hard to imagine the show without em .. 🙌🏽 Damm time flyin man got my dawg Martin lookin like big momma house 😂😂😩😩
Martin just doesnt have that spark that he did anymore..he used to be energetic and wild..now hes just calm and quiet. I understand hes aging and had health issues over the years but its sad to see.  I still love them all though.
Didn't like the way they had Anthony Anderson come out and say, they're not getting a Emmy without a joke behind it, I thought after the cast finished speaking,  Anthony Anderson was going to finish up with a joke about not winning, didn't like the way they ended this, I miss the Emmy's, so hopefully there was more to this that YouTube cut off It's bad enough they wasn't nominated to win an Emmy, who thought that would be funny to have Anthony Anderson say that, just wasn't funny to me, LOVE YOU AND THE CAST OF "MARTIN" 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
BEST SITCOMS EVER... 1-Sanford & Son 1A-Martin 2-What's Happening  3-Good Times THAT'S THE BEST COMPLIMENT POSSIBLE! Much respect to the cast of "Martin". Thanks for the memories...✌️
COLEEEEEEE 😂😂 Carl literally took me back ❤️❤️💯💯💯
That show Martin made the hood safe for one whole hour because everyone was at home watching it 😂 SHOW CHANGED THE CULTURE 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 RIP TOMMY WE MISS YOUR LAUGH
Tisha looks UNBEWEAVEABLE
Great to see them all together wish tommy was here rip  and yall deserve an Emmy award and great cast my favorite show still funny and i still watch Martin on dvd😂😂😂😂👏👏👏👏
I guess i don’t get the humor? I feel like lamp shading the fact that they know which shows should have gotten one (especially shows that were huge for black TV) and to address it in satire instead of integrity? It’s embarrassing on both ends.  gives poor taste. In the same breath, Idk why i expected anymore than this.
Hard to see Martin a shadow of what he once was
Was Martin a little off or is it just me?
Ok why did this clip end like that?
Carl look like he hasn't aged a day
Why the monkey 🦧 noises? 🤨 @ 0:35
I loved they still brought it like they still been on the air and called out the blatant disrespect the show received in the 90s never being nominated for Emmy.
They had natural talent. On point and always hilarious. A classic show. So disrespectful that they were never recognized for their talents. My favorite is when Martin was the security officer. They should have received an Emmy long time ago m. How long too long. Wrong on all levels.
I would had tuned in if i knew they were bringing the Martin cast out! 😒
Not getting a Emmy is one thing, But to never be nominated... Then be asked to present a award is as rude as it gets. Please do better... you can tell martin can care less about these people's award and is tried of trying. Probably why jenna talked the entire time.
Martin show was horrible, the jokes were mean spirited and usually directed at a woman.
I need Cole’s hat
Wow, you serious ? not even a nomination
Gina called him Carl lol whaattt coooole
Martin not receiving an Emmy was the biggest ripoff in history.  I guess the powers that be were too busy watchin Friends and Frasier.
Something wasn't right about  Martin how is he doing and how is his health ❤️
R. I. P. Tommy you are truly missed 🙏🏾
FUCK THE EMMYS. MARTIN WAS NUMBER 1.. THEY TRIED MOVING THE SHOW TO DIFFERENT TIME SLOTS AND HE STILL KICKED ASS.
It sucks so bad how Martin's health has depreciated over the last few decades....he's like a shell of his former self....😥😢😭
RIP Tommy. Hope he found a damn job in heaven!
Something off with Martin, where is that fire? Must be age? But they need an Emmy
Having Tommy on the coffee table!! Everything! 😢😢
When he fought that rat on the honeymoon is the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV to this day "that ain't no damn puppy"😂
🐐
I thought Anthony Anderson was gonna drop the Tommy “Dawg!!!”
Martin just doesn't seem like the same person to me. Like everyone is still them but he's very much a different person
MARTY AND TISHA LOOKING LIKE SUMTN WRONG..... HOPE THEY ARE ALRIGHT CAUSE CARL TRISHINA AINT LOOKING HALF AS BAD.
The Martin show was one of the funniest sitcoms ever in my opinion!
What did they do to Martin? It's always our Greats.
"That ain't no d@mn puppy!" As a Black teenager in America during the 90's This was the show. This is where YOU GO GIRL came from and so many others. 🤣
I want that Rent 'em spoons hat!! LOL
Good memories
No Cole didn't break out with "RENT'EM SPOONS" bucket joint ??!!
Tommy in the pic on the table
Was hoping Brutha Man was gonna come thru the window from the fifth floor
Both of them was looking nice..Cole was funny 😂😂😂
Am I the only one that feel like Martin went off script
Damn martin look old den a bih...dat sucks try to stay youthful folks
That picture of Tommy breaks my heart. ♥️
"Rent em spoons" aw man 7pm everybody was in the crib Good times..we use to be quiet waiting to see what the episode was going to be about..  Martin❤
this show should have more then 10 emmy's!!! this was my childhood show !! best
they edited the ending with maaarten sluuuuurrren hahahaha
The fact that Martin never won an Emmy is absurd!!!  Ohhh, the picture of Tommy on the table😭
Man what happened to hyper goofy Martin lol we got quiet serious Martin now :/ I even noticed that during the Reunion special
Martin ain’t the same no more I get people age but he just different now like he don’t really know what’s going on or something
Tichina looking like The Borg. "Resistance is futile" looking azz.
I remember almost 10 years ago i lost my job and my sister still til this day got my # saved as damn tommy you aint gt no job.. bitch
RIP Tommy Dawg!!!!!
Why did they cut the footage there? Martin was still talking!
Well damn what happened to Martin he looks bad
I CON IC
Are they going to do this with every show? Full House had 192 episodes and no Emmy. Family Matters had 215 episodes and no Emmy.
Lol I like how Anthony threw that shade 😂he aint happy about not winning all them times.   Martin is the peoples choice...no award compares to being named one of the greatest by the people.
They should get a throwback Emmy Award for the show💯
Martin & Big Momma's House Reboot  Martin, Pam & Anthony  Big Momma, Ritha & Nolan
Is Martin ok???
This needed a bigger picture of Tommy.
Just hoping Marty Mart is doing ok 👍🏿 🙏🏿; glad to see the other members of the cast;continue to R.I.P Tommy!
This show deserves an award 💯
The Martin show put out some very nice important messages for black culture that show definitely deserves an Emmy
I was waiting on Shanaynay to come out and Martin to say " Damn Gina! "...😊😂😂😂😂😂
What’s wrong with Martin? Low energy and appears to be subdued..
The fact that Martin got featured along with such iconic hits like The Sopranos, I Love Lucy,   All In The Family, Cheers etc proves to those that don't know that Martin is one of the greatest sitcoms of all time and definitely one of true classics period! 👏  oh, and they dun messed up never giving Martin an Emmy. Nobody did what he did back then with all those characters and the improv. He was the Black 90s equivalent to Jackie Gleason when it came to physical comedy and improv.
😂🤣😭😭😭...💙🧡💛💚💜
Tommy's picture ❤❤🕊
We all know the demographics for nominations. So we shouldn’t be surprised that the Emmy’s never recognized Martin. But who cares what they recognized. That show helped shape one of the greatest era’s to grow up in…. the 90’s. I loved the late 80’s too.  But our people give  that show something an Emmy could never.  Black love. Cause we love the ish outta that show still to this day.
PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT THEY GOT TIL IT'S GONE ~~ _"GINA" FUCKED UP THE SHOW!!_
Very iconic moment ❤❤❤❤❤
Cockroach Cole still looks the same!
It's a shame they didn't cause it was a great show
Everyone looks good!!!! 🎉
Martin was Epic and so successful it’s clear the Emmys is bullshit.
In honor of Tommy and one of the greatest running jokes ever, "YOU AIN'T GOT NO JOB, MAN!!!"
No bruh man???
Rent Em Spoons!!! 😂😂😂😂 I remember that episode when Martin and everyone was trying to think of a name to name the resturant. Since I was born in 96 I grew up watching the reruns of the show "Martin". R.I.P "Tommy" ❤🕊
Best show ever no 🧢
RENT EM SPOONS!!
Martin’s looking tired, and Gina was playing Morticia Adams.
Damm I was waiting for Martin to be funny
Martin is truly a shell of himself. Cole was everything. Lol 😆
So Martin never got an Emmy respectfully I would not have came , very big of them to show up.
My favorites
Who invited Gina? 🙄
Has martin LAWRENCE had another stroke?
I wish bruh man from fifth flo’ climbed thru that window!! That episode when Martin thought they stole his cd player!! And it really was bruh man 😂😂😂😂
Martin is so humble now. It's like he's scared of Hollywood.
Tisha is right the show is in syndication and I got my grandkids watching it.  We love this show it's a black national anthem in my house. The show was priceless with humor!  Love y'all for showing the world that black people can act, be funny, and become icons! Thank y'all for that!
Carl saying, I’m leaving here with something. Reminds me of the interview with Denzel Washington and Jamie Fox.
Martin sat back and let his people shine!!!! Martin is the man!!!
OMGGG🥹🥹🥹😩
Not the same without tommy
😎😎😎
They should have gotten a emmy a long time ago,they were a whole lot better Than Friends,ithought Friends was never funny.
Iconic
Martin looked out of it hope he’s ok ?
So strange without Tommy 😢
Maybe  Bra Man has the Emmy on the 5th 🖐🏾floor.🤣🤣🤣
REST IN PEACE DAWWGG!!!
I guess Bruh man from the 5th flo didn't get his invitation to the Emmys
I love me some Cole 😂😂
Tommy must be at his job😂😂😂💥💥💥💥wink wink
What's going on with MARTIN? LOOKED a little off
FUCK THE EMMYS THE OSCARS AND ALL THE PEDOS INVOLVED!
Martin Lawrence is a shell of his former self... sad
I love me some Tommy! Rest in Paradise and I was waiting for brotherman to pop out on the scence!! ❤️it!!
Sn: Can’t nobody tell me Martin wasn’t high as a kite off that good Mary Jane 😂 brother was cool and a cucumber!   It was beautiful seeing the cast reunite! Even if they don’t give us a new show. Give us a movie to bring  good ending to the characters 😩 at least.
What, no Bruh man?
Tommy WHAT DOES GTD Stand For!!???? 😂😂              Who knows the Answer ?…..
R.I.P Tommy! Bruh Man shoulda been there as well.
"Martin" deserved to be nominated for Emmys during the 90s. That TV show was hilarious!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Still watch it almost every night.
Cole didn't miss
It’s horrible that Martin was never won or ever nominated.  Also, Tisha needs a stylist, or a new one. Just saying
Fuck Fox, and damn martin, you doing this now…..
Ooh ooh!!!!
very very special reunion. How could they have never been nominated. That was the best sitcom ever. Wishing them all good health and continued laughs.
This was so cringe to me! They deserve so much more.
The fact that MARTIN was never even nominated for a Emmy, the show has not been off air since its first episode which was in 1992… that shit screams RACISM, bc who cares about a little black show, right? Someone clearly cares if it’s been in syndication since 1992, but you let them tell it no one cares … I said what I said!
Cole was always my fav!!!
My favorite sitcom ever!
So this sad skit was the Emmy’s way of offering a mea culpa?  😮
Rentem spoons!
Man this show was awesome in the 90s i miss itthey dont make shows like this
I wish Martin was infront of the camera more often in 2024.
They all still look good tbh and yes Pam still fine 😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Literally for the culture !!!!!!!!! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Wow, stupid
What’s wrong with Martin.  Somebody said he different.  Wow.
We the people speak and we all agree that "Martin" had 90's TV on smash.
Rest In Power Tommy Power. 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
❤❤❤
All Black shows don't win Emmy's do they?
Martin look like big mama
Nice touch putting a picture of Tommy Ford on the table
we have to be mindful and know alone with the fact most black actors are underpaid and under valued in hollywood . martin, livin single, black ish,the jeffersons,sanford and son etc  they had ratings matching or surpassing white shows yet they didnt get the budgets or awards the white shows received
what's wrong with Martin?
Black excellent!!!! It's OK they been won for the culture!!!!
Omg I pray for Martin. He’s been like this for a few years now and it’s scary to see like the life gone out of him. He’s one of my fav 🥺🥺 🥺
RIP to Thomas Mikel Ford, who still ain’t got no job!
Cole......you stooopid 😅😂
Martin ain’t the same without tommy
Cole with the bird call 😂😂😂 iconic
This was cringe to watch a little.
RIP Tommy
Martin seemed off. Slow even
Physically Martin looks great! Damn near like his 90s self. I prey he’s good mentally.
It was weird hearing her call him "Carl".  I was like..."you mean Cole?!?" lol
One the GREATEST! Too bad that Fox used them (and others) to launch the network and didn't really push them during their time on TV as the greats that they were.
This show has NEVER been out of syndication. Generations love this show.
Forgot it was the Emmy’s for a second 😂 thought this was a new episode of Martin
"Cole..........you stupid"
Where bruh man at?😢
Martin=Greatest sitcom ever
What a time in life. The 90s
Damn Gina!
That was SO TERRIBLE! Martin ain't hardly say SHIT!! And it was his show! What happened to him!? :(
R.I.P, Tommy!
Never getting our props when we need them! But hell who needs them we got ourselves & our own "Emmy" award show don't we?!? Well sorta does BET count anymore? Well with all the Afrocan American actors we now have we should at least start our own! And by the way I just happened to have the perfect name for it! The "Gimmie" Award! Yes that's it.......... or is that too ghetto?🥴😜✌️💯
too bad Tommy passed and missed getting his showers.... we want a reboot, want a reboot
Martin was a phenomenal show and deserved multiple Emmy's!  It was really a groundbreaking show that helped put FOX on the map!💖💖
All i watched was this and fresh prince in late 90s
it's very disrespectful Martin never won an Emmy as it was one of the best shows ever on TV! Top tier cast that gave us some of the best laughs ever...Martin looked great, Tisha & Tachina were gorgeous, & Cole looked good too...Missing Tommy still 😢 I watched weekly & I & my family still does...Credit should go to the best & this show has always been & Will always be at the top 🌹❤️
Damn..... Tisha Campbell is ageless
Martin might be the funniest sitcoms Ive ever watched in my life.
It was on FOX, which was not one of the "Big Three" at the time. Back then shows on Fox were rarely nominated or won major awards.
“I still look good” took me out 🤣
Wait where’s the rest of the clip. It seems like it was cut off
The Emmy’s honestly should have surprised the cast live with honorary Emmy.
Martin and all the cast I love u all, especially u Martin u had alot of celebrates on ur Show,let's start from the show Good Times Sanford n Son,etc etc etc,now get tha steppn,lol
They would reboot the show of fans would stop asking for Tommy. My opinion.
WASSUP...WASSUP...WASSUUPPPP....MARTIIINNNN
Woooooow LMAO
Pam Damn Sho Still Look Good
Whenever I see Martin now all I can hear is "This fool gave me the script for Big Mommas House 2"
I love this and Cole hasn’t changed 😂
I was waiting for martin to throw people out?
Yes the phuck y’all do deserve one how about 3 of 4 hell 20 for all these years not being acknowledged 😤💯❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 Rest I’m paradise Tommy 🌺🙏🏾
Why they calling cole carl?😅
I have all the seasons dvds.  If they ever stop syndication, I will still be watching.
Not only were they ever nominated, they had to give awards to the corniest shows of today.
That stroke seems to have taken Martin's energy but it's great to see him and everyone else.
Where bruh man @ ? 🧍🏾‍♂
They deserved more during their run... Nice to see them tho!
Martin is different.
It would’ve been Epic  if Martin would’ve told Cole to sit his 5 dolla ass down before he make change🤣🤣🤣
Tisha can still get it
I miss TOMMY…RIP MARTIN was a great show!
I use to love watching Martin back in the 90's when I was a kid and I still do today. It's been over
Martin doesn't seem like himself here. I Hope he's doing good.
Martin is a bonified classic. Unfortunately, white validation is necessary for Emmy wins, and one of the most beautiful things about that sitcom was its BLACKNESS. The hilarity was all born out of a specific culture, which is why it holds a special place in our hearts. The ratings were huge for a reason. What's even bigger than the ratings is the LEGACY of the show.
I’m literally watching Martin on HBO max RIGHT NOW. Classic 90’s. Our era is untouchable.
“Them Emmy’s didn’t care about black ppl” in my KANYE VOICE!!
Martin's show was like visiting my neighbors next door... It felt real & that's when ya know ya in the presence of a Masterpiece Sitcom. RIP Tommy..
Martin is greatest show ever. Detroit still loves yall 🎉
Yep they were 1# for a while but we all know why they didn't get one let's be real
Carl is a legend in two games(Cosby Show, Martin).
Damn getting old suck it's hard seeing Martin like this. If you're in your 40s you understand
U guys did good
I love you all Martin cast!!! i use to call my sis Je nae nae 😂 she hated it. ❤ everyone loves Shenaynay. You deserved one, and you all look great here! 🎉
Should've said wheres tommy? He at work 😂😊
Carl's jacket tho
I totally missed the context of this, so did they get an award or not, or the award show had them come on stage to say they never got an award, that clip looked awkward.
Martin have a stroke?
Best tv show of its time & even now I still watch the repeats & laugh..
I watch Martin every morning from 6-9 never get tired of it
Tisha still fine as wine and Martin seemed a little drunk lol
My favorite sitcom of all-time. The best sitcom in the 90s! Go Martin!
That crowd was weak!!
Martin character broke he will never be or look the same
Well, that sucks.. I thought they would’ve at least gotten some sort of recognition, but whatever. 😒
Thursday nights on Fox was the line-up! Martin, Living Single and New York Undercover.  And then came gentrification.
A day late; Tommie is dead, a dollar short...
They all look Great!  Loved this show!
Ha ha No Emmy ..well Anthony bruh I hate to do it to you but you already know.. STEP!!! GET TA STEPPIN..
Okay I'm confused, why is X formerly known as Twitter commenters going coocoo over Martin's appearance and behavior? People are commenting how concerned they are due to the way he was acting and claiming he was slurring his speech. Which I didn't notice, anyone know what this is about?
The crowd was dead 😵 didn’t even clap at times. I seen every show
One of the best shows on TV at that time … not even an honorable mention.  However, the advertisers got paid and laughed all the way to the bank. Here we are years later … still NO recognition!  Martin Lawrence looks like he’s recovered from a possible Stroke and still … this genius and this beloved cast got Nothing From the Emmy Awards!!!
Beyond amazing
Martin Lawrence is a better man than me, because I wouldn't have gotten on stage with Tisha Campbell!!! Emmy or no Emmy 'NO'!!!
This is awesome!!!!
Was Martin Lawrence....drunk... 🤔
Rip Tommy 🙏
Yo wtf was this
Rent em spoons 🤣🤣🤣
Damn I didn’t want this to end, we need a reboot
Martin walks like he’s 65. Something is wrong with him ? Does not look right. Cole and Pam look great and still same energy !
The was so great and funny!

They Need To Bring This Show Back On TV
We're also missing Brothman From Da 5th Floor!!! COME ON NOW!!!
This Totally Looks Like A Martin Reboot
Martin Lawrence ain't been the same since he seen the Ooh Wee man lol
I binge the show every year and laugh as much each time 🙌🏽 Love them all and miss Thomas ❤
Greatest comedy show of the 90's. I still watch their reruns today.   R.I.P. to Tommy. 🙏🏾
Martin looks finished
They are beautiful!❤️👐🏾
Horrible
Im srry but when ever martin does these he doesnt seem happy idk… more thankful.. i thought he woulda atleast said something to pam llol something seems off with him
Martin always look like he sleepy... every time i see him
This is so amazing and Touching   Plus the picture of Tommy on the table and their amazing ratings
lol, they all got old and real mellowed out. Martin seems like he’s on tranquilizers, but I think he’s bipolar, so that could be his meds. Pam isn’t really mean anymore, and they are one man down. But they were amazing during their run. Tisha still looks good.
They owe Martin as a show and Tichina in everybody hates chris.
An Honorary Emmy 🎉🎉🎉🎉 It is truly well deserved accolades!! They were even humble to appear for this clip. They all look great!!!! ❤❤❤❤
That’s really funny Headdie Murphy
1:01 'Martin' should've won an Emmy in the 1990s
The Photo of Tommy
My favorite sitcom.
They ALL look great❤️
I miss Tommy............😢.
Martin looks depressed 😢
Was I the only one looking for Brahman to climb the window ?
They deserve an Emmy
This made me smile like crazy but i busted out laughing at 1:26🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I still watch this show❤
Great to see the Martin Cast once again however Martin looks tired
This is why I have ZERO respect for these award shows. Martin is the best comedy series of all time, and NO nominations is crazy!
Horrible skit
You can see Big Mamma in Martin's face. 😬
Wow😮
But corny un funny "friends" got emmys 😂😂
Loved the picture of Tommy on the Table.
Rent em spoons😂😅😂😅😂😅
“I’m sorry I lied to you Martin, I just didn’t want to go to Arizona.” My household still quotes Martin til this day!! 😂
I want that hat Cole!!!
I love Carls jacket! They all look great😊
Emmys always missing. Raising Kanan should be nominated the acting in there is phenomenal!.
Martin look stiff
❤
Martin didn't look healthy. Gina, Pam, and Cole still looked good. God bless the dead big Tom. Hopefully, they got jobs in heaven.
They didn’t put a Martin in a dress?
No black shows were recognized back then hell even now lol well now a days try e black shows are horrible accept power and 50s other shows
Kinda cringe
Martin doesnt seem right.  He seems like he's moving and speaking in slow motion.  It was noticeable in Bad Boys 3, where his energy level is nonexistent.
I wished they would have said the character Tommy couldn't make it he's at work.   🤣🤣🤣🤣 Rip Tommy
The best show of the 90s! Love the entire cast! ❤
I mean when your black and most of the cast member are black what do you expect coming from America
They should’ve at least got an Emmy now with an apology…something an honorary Emmy. Like wow! The world we live in..the hate but imitation we get is wild.
They all look look and acting Ike they 70 except cole
Bruh man should've came through the window! that would've made this EPIC
Martin was tooo quiet
Martin Lawrence tried to push a sex worker out of an airplane door, mid flight. He is garbage. He has no respect for women. His SNL monologue was the most offensive grouping of words I have ever heard. I remember the audience slowly stopped clapping, or laughing. He was insulting women’s soft parts, and the studio was silent. He is GARBAGE.
_"Give 'em soup for free. _*_Rent 'em Spoons!"_* 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Soooo what was the point of this?
Never nominated this is how you know these award shows are rigged
Mannnnn Martin getting old makes me sad low key
That was my all time favorite sitcom of the 90s
Why is Hollywood like this? Play in your face and tell you that you’ll never get their award but use you to present an award for others. Everyone knows the injustice but just joke about it. Weird.
What the fuk did I just watch.  Martin looking like he in the Claude Banks suit talking like he dont remember some of his kids and grand kids, Tina want get that gap in her bottom tooth fix, Anthony Anderson walked out and shit just went off 🤦🏿‍♂
🏆
That's why I stopped watching award shows.  It's about time the show, along with other great black casts received some long, overdue recognition and respect.  As soon as Fox, CW, UPN got ratings and money with black comedies, they dropped all of them.
I love how Martin always shows love to Tommy 🎉❤. The entire cast looks great 😃
Tommys laugh would've been the icing on the cake.
Is his name Carl or Cole because this is getting very Mandela effect right now lol … I remember him being named Cole. Never once heard them say Carl on the show.
I think they didn’t get one because of the Martin and Tisha issue
Is Martin’s health ok??
Missing Our Tommy. RIP
Thank you!
One of the best, ever.  Peace to Tommy and Nipsey.  Peace to the cast of Living Single as well.
I am going to say it. This is the show that set the tone for the new generation of black sitcoms when it came to comedy when it came to insults this is the OG the original trailblazer,icon ,legend
The greatest sitcom. Hands down 💯
tommy: AND YOU KNOW THIS DAWGGGGG!!!!!
Martin on hella 💊 💊  here
🖤🖤🖤
Cole 😂😂😂😂
One of my all-time favorites from the 1990s.  We got some many good and crazy catchphrases from the "Martin" show!!!!   The cast is looking exceptionally good!!! ❤️💋💯
Martin Suck after Tommy pass away😢😢
A beautiful moment indeed!!!! That show will forever be etched in my heart.
Martin is lit
Why didn't "Martin" say more?  It was his show.  They need to do something else together.  Great cast.  I was in high school when this show aired.  I appreciate it more now as an adult.  I am so glad it is in syndication!
I still haven't seen a meatloaf and waffles restaurant. I wonder ....
I love they have Tommys picture on the table ❤❤ RIP
It's disrespectful that they weren't even nominated. Anthony: "Mmmm..." (Translation: "You know why...")
Martiiiiiinnnn
Best line up on TV during college (shout-out Morgan State):  Martin Living Single  New York Undercover  Thursday nights was "must see TV"!  /bklyn👑
Martin acting like Claude lol
Gina fine AF
Still funny to this day😂😂😂
Such a beautiful moment. I’m hoping more of our shows are recognized/honored for their longevity and their impact.
What’s CRAZY is I’m currently watching the show in 2024 on tv while watching this clip 🎉 Iconic. RIP Tommy Strong 🕊️
picture frame of tommy on the table. that's cool
Totally agree
Really Loved this, really hope they do this next year but with the Fresh Prince or some other classic sitcom show.
The Emmys had this, they also had the Cheers group together.  Just a reminder TV was so much better 30 years ago.
Maybe if Gina wouldn't tried to sue yall would have gotten one. Her and her husband was trying to scam
I wanted to see Martin be ol Marty Mar again! I hate that all his characters since are so docile. At least he could have hit us with wzuuuup!
🤎🤎
I got MARTIN tv show on DVD every season of every episode...I Love this show, mannn.!!!! As a 80's baby...I grew up on Martin and the Fresh Prince shows. But Martin always more funnier to me. So now....if BET is not showing it (syndication shows) I can always just rely on good old DVD
Martin looks very disappointed and he should be the Martin show was the best you had to watch.
Tf  was that 😂
Martin was a funnier show than Seinfeld and Martin Lawrence is a better actor than Jerry Seinfeld.   Yup I said it 👉👉👉✊
Forget a damn award
They should’ve had bra man come through the window while everybody taking, he just walk in and gonin the refrigerator and walk back out 😂😂😂 classic
Rent Em Spoons🥄 classic son.
I bought the entire series a few years back. They are almost all scratched up now(except the 5th season). I will gladly buy another set soon. Miss u much Tommy❤
Tf wrong wit Martin ? asking the Emmy's
I love the rent em spoons hat
My favorite comedy show of all time!
LOVED THIS SHOW, but it is almost sad watching this "reunion" instead of joyful. Sigh...
& Martin Still On Tv Too This Day 🤦🏾
One of the funniest shows ever. Still watch to this day!
Why they cut it?
My fav show! They should have won one
I was waiting for Bruhman from the 5th flo to pop through the window
Um.  What's up with Unc Martin?  He ok?  I know we all change as we age, but he looks  like something may up wrong health wise.  No shade, just concern
So now they wanna give this show its grace. It’s the disrespect for me.
Damn no Tommy? He must've been busy at his job.  RIP
They should have had brotha Man come through the window with the Emmy lol..
They deserved an Emmy! Everyone looks good!
I was waiting for Martin to say "Daaayymmm Ginnnnaaa"
It’s like they haven’t missed a beat. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why does Martin seem like he's on 0.25x speed? I wonder if they killed the real Martin and replaced him, same with Chapelle who looks like a jacked Rock.
The crowd aint it for me....smh
This show is the culture
What was Martin on? I know he's older but, he didn't seem to have any pep in his talking or appearance. Even when the perfect opportunity for a "Pam" insult came up, he was quiet.
When they said from the hit tv show… I can’t lie, hella triggered lmao😊
Got the drawz dawg! 😂😂😂
Martin is such an iconic show, & I luv both Tichina & Tisha 2getha.💓🖤💓🖤💓🖤💓🖤
Best sitcom of my childhood! R.I.P. Tommy ❤
Martin should have been nominated!
Rip Tommy ❤❤❤❤
Carl with the Rent Em Spoons hat😂. Rest in peace Tommy missing that laugh❤
I been watching this show since it came out. All 3 my kids love Martin. Fn classic fr
I am shocked Martin show never received any Emmy nominations. The cast look amazing 👏🏼
When I saw this my mind was blown! I love Martin!
RIP Tommy
Sandford and Son, Martin and the Bernie Mac show is Gold!!
Best Sitcom of ALL time! Rest in paradise Tommy Strong 💪🏾💐
Very arguably the greatest sitcom cast ever assembled. R.I.P. Tommy Ford.
❤❤❤
I love how they have this photo of Thomas Mikal Ford to recognize him. Forever missing you sir. The Martin theme music gets me dancin'. So many brilliant comedy moments.
Still quote this show.
Martin should not have won an Emmy during it's run. Thank goodness it hasn't.
This was the best comedy show of the 90s period! 🤭💜
Martin Lawrence is looking amazing
Should have,damm good show.
Classic 😍 😍 😍 😍 😍
1st Regina and Angie Sl0bbing each other down now this whew this yr is starting off with a bunch of surprises and as a sag I LOVE IT
❤
My favorite comedy sitcom when I was growing up.
LEGENDARY!!!!!! WE STILL WATCHING!!!!  RIP TO THE LEGENDARY MR THOMAS MIKAL FORD!!!!
Rent ‘‘em spoons!!
I think we all heard Tommy say " Carl, You Stupid"
Only white shows win Emmy’s even though the show sucks
😂🙏🥰💜⚘️
RIP TOMMY 🙏🏽❤
Can we finally know what Tommy did for a living
This is not cool. Why have them there if they don’t get anything 😢
Imma say it. Something had happen to Martin Lawrence and as a true fan of him since What’s Happening it’s heartbreaking.. and it’s not just age..
Martin should've won a emmy smh just sad
Martin speech seems off. When did he have the stroke?
Tisha didn't age well. Karma for doin Martin dirty
The show was back in the day when they didn't give black actors and shows Academy Awards or  Emmy Awards. Hell they still don't they just do it for the ratings nowadays. There I said ir.
What a legendary show🎉
I see Martin's stroke finally slowed him down enough to not attempt to take over the stage.
A highly influential show.
They meant Martin, Gina, Pam, and Cole. RIP Tommy
Cole still the same, he KILLED it😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂classic they should've gotten lifetime achievement or something lol
Tisha looks good. Martin lost weight. Everyone looks great. This would have been super successful reboot if Tommy were still here.
It’s disrespectful how this show was never nominated!! This was best show of the 90s and one of the greatest shows ever.
Tisha’s body was banging back then.  They all still look good 🙌🏾
So good!! 😂🤍
Forever missing Tommy!❤🕊
I was just waiting to see Bruh Man climb through the window 😂
No bruh man 5th floor?
Dang what happened to Martin? He looked like he was on something (medical or illegal).😢
Omgggg this is soooo DOPE!!
Carl wearing a hat that says “Rent em spoons” is EVERYTHING to me 😂😂
Carl Payne aka "Cole" looks the same
Tommy 🥹🥹🥹🥹
Man, they don't even look the same
🥹🥹 RIP Tommy
👏👏👏👏👏☺️
Welcome to the bet awards. Y’all straight up disrespected Latinos!
