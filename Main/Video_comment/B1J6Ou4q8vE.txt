I have never seen anything like this!! You should really start a math series from scratch.
In school my teacher show this to students!

I'm gonna reteach myself math by time stamping and screen shotting where i get confused and don't know what's happening so i can figure it out later
Make the animation vs Chemistry🧪
6:23
Just an idea to connect this to the main series, but you could make it so the color crew breakes the code of the computer causing them to somehow teleport into different dimensions aka the math, physics, coding, geometry and addiction (I don't know about addiction though), they all try to get to your computer again and succeed in a future AvE video

You can actually fall asleep to this, I took a nap yesterday to the clicking sounds. They're just satisfying to listen to😴😌
I love math haha😂 this was super❤
A great lesson for any teaches out there would be to assign the video and have your students list every math concept the see in order of appearance.
If the two roots of the equations (x - 1)^2 = m and (x - 3)(x - n) = 0 about x are the same, what is the value of n?

Good skills of for simulations jeje
this is absolutely cinema

My favorite was the decimel. It showed spaces between numbers when thrown.
This is what makes me think TSC is almost as smart as Yellow or the King are, since he managed to learn basics and really advanced maths in ten minutes without apparent prior knowledge. Then he does the same with physics.
Bro you got a very good imaginacion

Bro, the only reason I watch this is because I wanted to learn lol
If u think about it, all the major signs in the other episodes, met one another.  Science- the circle with a line between it Math - the little sign that looks like an “e” The other two idk what episodes they r, but I do know one is from Physics and the other is Geometry
Video presentations are the new books
Kinito.exe
Evee
how did he get here
That incredible I can’t believe that stick man is so smart
Which app do you use for this kind of app
i want a interactive website of this
Late to the party, algo did good to recommend this, i love it! As if La Linea had a genius baby. There, i aged myself, lol. So math courses are way back, felt real smart at the start ("I get it!") but that morphed as quickly as your animations into 'I will need to not only re-watch this, but also watch some math person explain it in another video, step by step'. Do you hear me, YouTube? We love this kind of creativity, it's good for views and retention, give us more of this and just exclude the AI slop. Thanks for a great video.

Watching dis instead of doing my math homework
I cannot even imagine how many weeks/months the animations take. Especially as a person who have dealed with the Fourier Transformation, all of the underlying knowlegde are on point.^^ This is simply a masterpiece. 👍👍👍

Also he discovered division 2:49 discovered a loophole 2:57 wait TSC they mean the same thing how is it not repeating 3:06 Squared.

Also there was an expanded formula for e, so he used that. 4:23 e performed the subtract which flipped him, cuz 0 - 1 is negative, flipping sides. 4:34 He used times on his legs meaning he multiplied his speed. 4:50 Look closely, 4 - 1 is 3, so TSC’s blade got removed, and e’s blade is at 3. 4:54  2 x 2 is 4. so he shoots 4s. 5:42 Theta in the center 5:51 1 in length 6:00 R and theta are used to make polar graphs. im too lazy to make the res

I'm not good at Math but I am good in giving other characters more life! Pls give me correction if i did one of the moves wrong. :<  10:00  "Euler's Creation" Abilities (as of now):  Negative Area: "With a slam with its staff, the shockwave produces a negative output. The second a man touches it, he is gone."  Hailing Values: "With its left hand, it creates values with unknown effects, most of which are known to give negative effects. The second a man touches it, the effects are certain to be deadly as of now."  Euler's Call: "It rejuvenates its clones known as 'e^(i*pi)' and gives them a new goal—to exterminate all opposing forces—while also helping them. A man against all of these entities is certain to die."
Bro this is better than ASMR
unironically, all the vs education help me fall asleep at night
Soundtrack?
As a math enthusiast, I absolutely adore this.
This is amaizing !

Now i know why i major on social science, I lost track of things on the 4:00 minute mark 😂
How did Orange get there?

Hello
Amazing!!!
I cried. It was that good
As an artist and mine sweeper lover I can confirm the math (especially geometry) is essential in life. But sence Ik some of u aren’t artists just give me ur dream job and I’ll prove the math is needed in life
Did I just watch the entire Matrix in stick-figure? And in green code language ? 🤯
this guy became from genius to math genius

Thie is so epic just like in my mind playing and dancing nimbers
Even without an intimate knowledge of math, this is quite enjoyable.   I can only imagine the fun someone who knows math has watching this .
It’s weird how one book can quietly change your entire mindset. “Glow They Never Saw” by Zael Veynor did that for me. I used to scroll past comments recommending random books, but I’m doing it now because this one actually helped me. It doesn’t hand you motivational quotes, it shows you how your discipline breaks down in tiny, invisible ways. It’s not “feel-good” advice, it’s uncomfortable truth. If you’re someone who overthinks everything or struggles with confidence, just read the first few pages. It’s raw, but it feels like therapy without the fluff...
I Magen we have a weapon called math
Pov: student after elementary
Am I the only one almost crying for watching this beautiful animation?
.
THE F
As a visual learner who always struggled with math, this scratches a particular itch. Like if I had this little stick guy teach me math, I'd be a chemist by now :P
How did we go from 1+1 to this
обьясняет лучше чем моя класуха
Amazing
I stiil do not get why are they fighting

what the last part mean?
100 + 1 is 101
🙌❤✨🌌♥️🤩💯🔝
The cos sin beam will get you
e e e e e e e e e
I imagine Alan just watching TSC figure out math 😭
Dude this teaches us math more then the whole school ever will
No joke, my Algebra I teacher showed my class this video last year.
Friend:how did you learn math  Me:a video
How to run learn p1-s6 math in 14m:
4:17 You wrote Euler's formula wrong, you wrote -cos(π) + i·sin(π) while the correct one should be -cos(π) - i·sin(π)
4:16 You wrote Euler's formula wrong, you wrote -cos(π) + i·sin(π) while the correct one should be -cos(π) - i·sin(π)
4:16 You wrote Euler's formula wrong, you wrote -cos(π) + i·sin(π) while the correct one should be -cos(π) - i·sin(π)
11:15 special move: THEY SEE ME ROLLIN
My brain hurt
And the and is that phi zeta and aleph the flying one I don't know
What is blud doing deos he thing he is Einstein     What is blud doing deos he think he's Einstein  What is he puting into to the calculator
10:02   YAAAA!
eiπ's family is here!
Both of them fought each other only to realize their friendship in the last.
1+1 =11
I know this is not canon but I feel like the canon reason for this is because TSC was experimenting with the calculator app (Put it on the kings staff or smth like we see in apps staff) and then acidentally teleported to the world inside it. Then he goes to physics and geometry and all from there. I have no explanation for Yellows journey and Blues journey seems to have some connection with the canon universe because of the mediation scene in AvA 12 but I have no idea what.
I barely understand the first half of this.
Numbers are screaming in 8:36
Absolute cinema
Hello, I'm Brazilian, I don't like math, but I watched until the end ❤😂
So cute
e iπ makes ie iπ
Why e is the one with life?
My teacher even showed us this thx!
10:02 Baby scream!!!

Por que apareceu um aleph no fim do vídeo?
Beautiful! These equations are all correct!❤❤❤
I gotta be honest, I really hate math but watching orange play around with the numbers and symbols and stuff seems kinda satisfying to watch :)
Hi Alan thanks for this art We really need an other part  Please
Came back 2 years later i hope i know more
I'm back to watch peak🥹
fggg
7:24 Using a radian as a rapier what should we call that
Teacher: "It's just math, it can't hurt you."  The Math in Question: "10:32"
Only time ive ever enjoyed math
I love the music choice and this actually teaches me stuff fr you should make a part two
I want to get in this world. It looks amazing. No bugfixing my code, no floating point errors, infinite operations per second, auto-simplifier.
Ok
why in the end there was a giant א
you love e
Types of infinity
hey alan, i have a lil bit of cool symbols that is from your video  Θ∞ also a horse shoe cuz why not Ω
This lowkey better than school lol
i missed Terkoz so much
All understand was the OnePlus One at the start I understand nothing else
Thanks to this video, my 6-year-old nephew already understands multiplication and can do long addition and subtraction. He also copies Taylor's formula by hand. He constantly asks me, "When will we finally get to the exponential function?" Do you understand what your video means? You've motivated kids to learn math far more than teachers ever could!
If teachers showed this I would actually try to learn math 😂
THIS WAS 2 YEARS AGO ????
wAaAaAh "such inspiring words

А тут ошибка, e^(-iπ) = cos π + isin π это не правильно. Правильно было бы e^(-iπ)=cos π - isin π
11:18

Stop killing e
Where is log?
The most important part your time and then you will be able for me and love you and I will try and get make it up and be.🎉
How I feel trying to do a calculus exam
Music name?
….to think, me back at release, having just got finished with my final HS year, actually understood, at least _some of,_ the non-basic stuff like i’s and sin/cos, that sorta stuff, and now, me 2 years later just cant recall it…. I mean, I’m a bit sad over that for sure, but well, I guess I’m doing what I actually chose now at least
Amazing bro
١+١  ٢❤❤❤❤❤
Nice😂😂😂
Here i stopped the video cuz that all what Ik 😀
Anyone from 2025 ?
This is probably how súper advanced aliens fight their wars
9:30 " The Infinity Shot ( ∞ ). "
math is so boring that Alan Becker made it less boring with  epic figths and and peak endings and peka stuff, everything that alan touches, turns into "absolute cinema" lol thanks alan for making our lives less boring ;D
definetely my favorite animation of yours
Is there part 2🎉❤⚡🌋🔥🐊☄️🌈🌹🐯
is this considered studying?
I'm gonna get my teacher to play this at math time tomorrow
Are you smart or this AI math cause this math is Crazy
Me and my friends were watching this mid ela class 😭
the yah! from 10:00🤣 and the Explotion from 11:03 was INSANE BRO!
I liked how TSC looked at the zero like “hmmm.. that looks like my head.. just bigger”
🛩️ 11
WHAT😮
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000+1
i hated math until i saw this
Dude I asked what the square root of 4 and it did it the same time I did
10:02,❤
Please make a video called Animation vs. the Russian Language.😁
thanks for the tutorial, really helpful, good job.
Our math teacher opened this for usss
This is like something that you would see in a lucid dream you’re stuck in a dark room with numbers
graph of trignometric ratios is solid ha boss nice animation i revise my concept 😆😆😆😆
Is there some award that this can win cuz this is amazing
I didn’t know orange could be that smart, obviously orange is smarter then me
Hay algo que no entiendo, porque euler es el malo, o pq es el único que tiene "vida"

Salute to this man for putting that much effort in a video❤
I watched this instead of doing my homework and it counts.

teacher: learn in school! alan becker: lets do it my way.
I work as an animation specialist on a team that creates interactive educational content in the sciences. I'm a physics graduate. These animations deserve an Oscar. Congratulations.
Pls do animations vs PE

Why do we want to go to school when we have Alan God here?
The sfx for this are just amazing. The way they make slotting the numbers in sounds like machine parts clicking into place is so satisfying for me.
Tutorial plis

Umm, did the e kill TSC at the end there?
My favourite subject

In math, the lowercase "ein" symbol (∈) means "is an element of" or "belongs to" and refers to set membership, while the uppercase letter "E" can refer to the constant e (approximately 2.718), a fundamental mathematical constant, or it can represent the exponent in scientific notation, as in "1.23E+10".  Set membership symbol (∈)  Symbol: ∈ Meaning: "is an element of" or "belongs to". Usage: It's used to show that a particular item is a member of a given set. Example: If 'x' is an element of set 'A', you would write this as x ∈ A. The constant e (e) Symbol: A lowercase 'e'.  Meaning: A mathematical constant, also known as Euler's number, with a value of approximately 2.718.  Usage: It's a fundamental constant that appears in many areas of mathematics, science, and economics, similar to pi (π).  Exponent in scientific notation (E) Symbol: An uppercase "E".  Meaning: Stands for "exponent" and is used to multiply the preceding number by 10 to the power of the following number.  Usage: When writing very large or very small numbers on calculators or in computer displays, the "E" notation saves space.  Example: 1.23E+10 means 1.23 multiplied by 10 to the 10th power [1.23 x 10¹⁰].
Hhhhhhhh

How did Alan come up with the idea to put it at the end of the video ф? (f)
what is 1+1=? (joke)
When orange touch the zero it reminded me of is untouchable face😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If Alan can do this without a problem then he must have fought his teacher on the board
Why tf are the captions korean

I feel like you don't put this into number or you put that into math lore bro and especially if they made something like I don't know symbol or also can you make a symbol video
Math was my number one subject now it's zero somehow less than 1 and 2 is less than 3 and the tire place and 3 which means zero is a higher place than one
I need a whole fantasy movie like this.

This is how want my math lessons
Who noticed that all the other stick man has full heads and orange has a space in the middle?
I think this video I can learn faster
I want orange to be my math teacher bruh
11:17 is they saying "Lie"
1+1=2 hả ahn

One thing that I learned is that you can use =f(•) as a gun
𝑒^𝑖𝜋 + 1 = 0
e^iπ
this helped me understand maths (I’ IS CALLED MATHS I AM BRI’ISH)
i loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove maths

Nice work Also make such animations  about biological concepts like DNA and other cellular processes
126+123=？
4:00 😂😂 and 7:19 😂😂
Better than any other action movie.
My math teacher pulled this video up for us to learn math🔥🔥
Me acuerdo que yo veía esto de pequeña y ni sabía que chamucos eran las fracciones xd 🗿🗿🗿🗿

π^9.47 tell me in the comments
e+e(is 5.4+)
If you make e+iπ it will be -1 somehow
My math teacher sent me this
Imagine the amount of effort that alan had to put in the calculation and the animation
I have an average IQ of a rock.
I like when that little e When he transforms into that giant mode I like what he said like aaa
1+1=3
😮😮😊
the only way to make math cool is make it into a magic system and use it to craft weapons and giant magic mechs with magic swords
I imagine a math teacher putting this video on
this video got me ∑_{i=1}^{10} i = 55
10:02 the battle cry 😂😂
I think you're the enemy for Mr beast

How smart is Alan Becker:
e^iπ = -1 θ/r = π iπ - 1π Cos(π)+isin(π)
The end
Is so much sad😢😢😢😢😢😢
i remember seeing this come out and it said “3 days ago” now it’s 2 years ago
0 The placeholder for nothing, which means it doesn't exist. But if it represents nothing then it is something, meaning it exists. How do you divide the something of nothing with the nothing of something? The answer: you can't, if the thing itself is quantum.
Bro just showed everything we do on a calculator for the first time

All of math from elementary to university summarized in 14 minutes! I've been struggling with math for 12 years with a 1,300 gram brain, but this creature, despite having a blank head, learned all of math in 14 minutes and on its own💔🤕
2 years ago? I remember when this just came out
My math teacher when a zombie invasion happens and school is closed:
3:40 this marks the point where I no longer understand
This is how I imagine myself solving math problems
Love it but how do I animate like you do?
I think those stickmen are the fastest learners ever lived

Loved this video, keep up the great work!
Alan Becker! You should totally become a teacher with the great animation skills, and how you know all of this you should totally teach kids. Society would be super smart if you would become one.

Thanks bro. I’m struggling with math.
The fact that we watched this amazing animation in school
???😐
Как он здесь оказался?

11:34 My brain when I try to do any form of math
SOLVING THE THUMBNAIL The thumbnail says 1+1 so 1 is a mueral as in 1 thing like 1 meatball or 1 banana + is when 2 things are added to each otherso for example stick+stone is sword or smth ( ITS NOT FROM MINECRAFT I SWEAR) So when we count from 1-10 we go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 So a one + one is 1 counted again so its  2!
5:56 domain expansion
i some learned more than school
7:26 bro pulled out those minecraft instincts
This video is one reason for kids to say to their mom that youtube is good
Wow! That animation is so interesting!
P.O.V me every time I'm doing math, because I'm bad at math.
😂😂😂I don't get it
learning math is fun
I Love This ❤❤❤
people should use this video when teaching math.
You look Awesome Taylor!!
4:23 how e^0 makes a half circle , is there is any mathematical logic.. if yes please anyone explain

You have no way
Can we do

I want plus 7 = 8
I like this, this would be more popular than weird videos now so that kids will watch this and learn a lot. ❤
Bro just visually explained why anything divided by 0 = ∞  And this is huge.
это гениально
4:16 "- cos(π)+isin(π)"=1
Bro is the smartest animation
O que significa esse E?
Wow, Si todas las clases se matemáticas fueran así, cualquiera aprendería y sería la asignatura más cool de todas.
at the end of the video, the big guy was aleph i think....

Educactión: 😂 animation: 😮😮😮😮 THE animation so IS education
You know, I've just finished binge watching all of the AvM and AvA series, and I think I've developed my own theory:  Orange/TSC can basically interact/control most animation based stuffs. With his ability to bring drawings to life, be a pretty good fighter, and is super creative, his skills already make him stupid powerful. Sooooooooo, if he could go super saiyan mode at will, he'd truly be the most overpowered stickfigure in this universe. Hence why it takes very specific circumstances for him to tap into his "God Mode." With this, the most powerful stickman's powers are kept fairly tame so as not to break the universe (which it seems he can do without super god mode powers anyways sooooooo.)  Also, because this debate exists: Orange = Regular stick dude, totally normal, pretty good at beating stick-people up and bringing animation to life. This is normal.  TSC = I AM AN ALL POWERFUL BEING WHO CANNOT BE KILLED AND CAN REGENERATE THE DEAD!!! YOU KILLED MY FRIENDS, I WILL DESTROY YOU AND THEN BRING MY FRIENDS BACK, WAKE UP, FORGET EVERYTHING AND GO BACK TO BED!!!

I love how animation can just make you fascinated in types of things you wouldn't normally be by itself
I love how the depiction of infinitely divisible by zero. It's a much more philosophical way to depict dividing by zero and it is split evenly among math nerds, some are just too afraid to show it.
Why is this kinda fire

Did you know there's an useful method to find the Square Root of Three? (1.732050807568877293527446341505872366…) If 1² = 1, 2² = 4, and 4 > 3, that square root is between 1 and 2. Find every single number from 1.1 to 1.9 squared. It is between 1.7 and 1.8. Find every single number from 1.71 to 1.79 squared. It is between 1.73 and 1.74. Find every single number from 1.731 to 1.739 squared. It is between 1.732 and 1.733. Repeat this process until the number of digits you want. Works with every root! You see this process is endless, so the Square Root of Three is irrational. Thanks!

A triangle is a fundamental geometric figure defined as a three-sided polygon composed of three straight line segments that connect three non-collinear points, known as vertices. Each triangle has exactly three internal angles, the sum of which is always 180°, a fact proven by the Triangle Sum Theorem.  Triangles can be classified by both their sides and angles. Based on sides, they are scalene (no sides equal), isosceles (two sides equal), or equilateral (all sides equal). Based on angles, they are acute (all angles < 90°), right (one angle = 90°), or obtuse (one angle > 90°).  The Pythagorean Theorem applies only to right triangles, stating that a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. This theorem is a critical principle for calculating the length of sides in a right triangle.  The Triangle Inequality Theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. This property ensures that a triangle can exist with the given side lengths.  The Law of Sines and Law of Cosines relate the sides and angles of triangles, which is critical in solving triangles when the necessary information isn't directly available. These laws are key tools in trigonometry and are often used to solve problems in navigation, physics, and engineering.  In a triangle, several key points of intersection define its properties. The centroid is the intersection of the medians, the incenter is where angle bisectors meet and is the center of the incircle, and the circumcenter is where perpendicular bisectors meet and is the center of the circumcircle. The orthocenter is the intersection of altitudes.  Triangles tessellate space, form the basis of trusses, and appear in nature and architecture due to their inherent structural stability. The triangle’s simplicity combined with its strong geometrical properties makes it a cornerstone of both theoretical and applied mathematics.

Bro went to 1st grade to 12th grade in 14 minutes
Math is art ahh video
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THE MATH LORE  0:07 The simplest way to start -- 1 is given axiomatically as the first natural number (though in some Analysis texts, they state first that 0 is a natural number) 0:13 Equality -- First relationship between two objects you learn in a math class. 0:19 Addition -- First of the four fundamental arithmetic operations. 0:27 Repeated addition of 1s, which is how we define the rest of the naturals in set theory; also a foreshadowing for multiplication. 0:49 Addition with numbers other than 1, which can be defined using what we know with adding 1s. (proof omitted) 1:23 Subtraction -- Second of the four arithmetic operations. 1:34 Our first negative number! Which can also be expressed as e^(i*pi), a result of extending the domain of the Taylor series for e^x (\sum x^n/n!) to the complex numbers. 1:49 e^(i*pi) multiplying itself by i, which opens a door to the... imaginary realm? Also alludes to the fact that Orange is actually in the real realm. How can TSC get to the quantity again now?  2:12 Repeated subtraction of 1s, similar to what was done with the naturals. 2:16 Negative times a negative gives positive. 2:24 Multiplication, and an interpretation of it by repeated addition or any operation. 2:27 Commutative property of multiplication, and the factors of 12. 2:35 Division, the final arithmetic operation; also very nice to show that - and / are as related to each other as + and x! 2:37 Division as counting the number of repeated subtractions to zero. 2:49 Division by zero and why it doesn't make sense. Surprised that TSC didn't create a black hole out of that.  3:04 Exponentiation as repeated multiplication. 3:15 How higher exponents corresponds to geometric dimension. 3:29 Anything non-zero to the zeroth power is 1. 3:31 Negative exponents! And how it relates to fractions and division. 3:37 Fractional exponents and square roots! We're getting closer now... 3:43 Decimal expansion of irrational numbers (like sqrt(2)) is irregular. (I avoid saying "infinite" since technically every real number has an infinite decimal expansion...) 3:49 sqrt(-1) gives the imaginary number i, which is first defined by the property i^2 = -1. 3:57 Adding and multiplying complex numbers works according to what we know. 4:00 i^3 is -i, which of course gives us i*e^(i*pi)!  4:14 Refer to 3:49 4:16 Euler's formula with x = pi! The formula can be shown by rearranging the Taylor series for e^x. 4:20 Small detail: Getting hit by the negative sign changes TSC's direction, another allusion to the complex plane! 4:22 e^(i*pi) to e^0 corresponds to the motion along the unit circle on the complex plane. 4:44 The +1/-1 "saber" hit each other to give out "0" sparks. 4:49 -4 saber hits +1 saber to change to -3, etc. 4:53 2+2 crossbow fires out 4 arrows. 4:55 4 arrow hits the division sign, aligning with pi to give e^(i*pi/4), propelling it pi/4 radians round the unit circle. 5:06 TSC propelling himself by multiplying i, rotating pi radians around the unit circle.  5:18 TSC's discovery of the complex plane (finally!) 5:21 The imaginary axis; 5:28 the real axis. 5:33 The unit circle in its barest form. 5:38 2*pi radians in a circle. 5:46 How the radian is defined -- the angle in a unit circle spanning an arc of length 1. 5:58 r*theta -- the formula for the length of an arc with angle theta in a circle with radius r. 6:34 For a unit circle, theta / r is simply the angle. 6:38 Halfway around the circle is exactly pi radians. 6:49 How the sine and cosine functions relate to the anticlockwise rotation around the unit circle -- sin(x) equals the y-coordinate, cos(x) equals to the x-coordinate. 7:09 Rotation of sin(x) allows for visualization of the displacement between sin(x) and cos(x). 7:18 Refer to 4:16  7:28 Changing the exponent by multiples of pi to propel itself in various directions. 7:34 A new form!? The Taylor series of e^x with x=i*pi. Now it's got infinite ammo!? Also like that the ammo leaves the decimal expansion of each of the terms as its ballistic markings. 7:49 The volume of a cylinder with area pi r^2 and height 8. 7:53 An exercise for the reader (haha) 8:03 Refer to 4:20 8:25 cos(x) and sin(x) in terms of e^(ix) 8:33 This part I do not understand, unfortunately... TSC creating a "function" gun f(x) = 9tan(pi*x), so that shooting at e^(i*pi) results in f(e^(i*pi))= f(-1) = 0. (Thanks to @anerdwithaswitch9686 for the explanation -- it was the only interpretation that made sense to me; still cannot explain the arrow though, but this is probably sufficient enough for this haha) 9:03 Refer to 5:06 9:38 The "function" gun, now "evaluating" at infinity, expands the real space (which is a vector space) by increasing one dimension each time, i.e. the span of the real space expands to R^2, R^3, etc. 9:48 log((1-i)/(1+i)) = -i*pi/2, and multiplying by 2i^2 = -2 gives i*pi again. 9:58 Blocking the "infinity" beam by shortening the intervals and taking the limit, not quite the exact definition of the Riemann integral but close enough for this lol  10:17 Translating the circle by 9i, moving it up the imaginary axis 10:36 The "displacement" beam strikes again! Refer to 7:09  11:26 Now you're in the imaginary realm.  12:16 "How do I get out of here?" 12:28 Don't quite get this one... Says "exit" with 't' being just a half-hidden pi (thanks @user-or5yo4gz9r for that) 13:03 n! in the denominator expands to the gamma function, a common extension of the factorial function to non-integers. 13:05 Substitution of the iterator from n to 2n, changing the expression of the summands. The summand is the formula for the volume of the n-dimensional hypersphere with radius 1. (Thanks @brycethurston3569 for the heads-up; you were close in your description!)  13:32 Zeta (most known as part of the Zeta function in Analysis) joins in, along with Phi (the golden ratio) and Delta (commonly used to represent a small quantity in Analysis) 13:46 Love it -- Aleph (most known as part of Aleph-null, representing the smallest infinity) looming in the background.

do you use noto sans symbol for this video? cuz the font looks exactly like it
It only took 3 minutes for me to not understand any of this.
i got interested in math, all because of your video. Euler's identity really played a key role to me understanding math Also the Taylor expansion of Euler's identity is equal to e*i*π

I love Alan Becker animations, I am a fan of math but I need to be thanked to this marvellous math animation. Because of this video, I tried to learn integral, unknown numbers as x, y, z or t. But sometimes they use a, b or c like in the Πυθαγόρειο θεώρημα and x^n too... I succeed to do that. So if we put the summary of my message to the table, this video made me curious about math. Thanks Alan Becker...

Fantastic journey!
This looks interesting, that's how one finds out about math. Maybe, uhh, also create an animation about chemistry? Especially about the organic branch, it does get interesting...
I love how orange just made a mathematical death star

6:58 There is a mistake. When you hit sin for the x-axis, it stops with cos, but when you hit cos for the y-axis, it should stop with sin, but it hits cos again.
As a math student, it looks all better than the other lessons
Sir, your videos are a true distillation of wisdom—each concept has been carefully simplified to make learning effortless and engaging. I am immensely grateful for the clarity and depth you provide. Thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge!
How have I stumbled upon this just now? This is ridiculous!
absolute cinema !!!
Okay, let's break down the math journey of the orange stick figure in that cool animation! It's a mix of real math concepts, visual gags, and a journey towards one very famous equation.  Think of it like this: The stick figure is exploring the world of numbers and symbols, sometimes playing with them, sometimes discovering deep connections.  Part 1: Simple Counting and Arithmetic (with some tricks!)  1=1: It starts by showing the basic idea that a number equals itself.  1+1=2: It turns the equals sign into a plus and duplicates the '1' to show simple addition.  Adding More 1s: It continues adding 1s (1+1+1=3, 1+1+1+1=4...). This is just basic counting.  Arithmetic Gags: Soon, the math gets deliberately weird!  It shows things like 1+1+1 = 10 or 2+2+2+2 = 20. This isn't correct math! It's a visual gag where the stick figure manipulates the digits or just makes up results for fun or to show frustration/power.  It eventually gets to 100 through a series of these incorrect or visually manipulated steps.  Simplifying to 100: It then correctly shows 1+99=100.  Subtraction: It correctly shows 100-1=99, 100-1-1=98, and even the clever 100-1-1-98 = 0.  More Gags: It then shows incorrect subtraction like 98-1-1 = -1. Again, visual trickery.  Part 2: Euler's Identity (The Famous Bit)  -1 = e^(iπ): This is the first major reveal. The stick figure changes -1 into e^(iπ). This is a real and very famous mathematical equation called Euler's Identity. It connects five fundamental mathematical constants:  e (Euler's number, the base of natural logarithms, ≈ 2.718)  i (the imaginary unit, √-1)  π (Pi, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, ≈ 3.141)  1 (the multiplicative identity)  0 (the additive identity) The full identity is usually written as e^(iπ) + 1 = 0, which means e^(iπ) must equal -1.  Abstract Play: The stick figure then plays with the components i, e, and π in an abstract way, not representing specific math operations.  Part 3: Revisiting Concepts (Powers, Roots, Division)  Multiplication/Division: It shows correct relationships like 12 = 6 x 2 and 3 = 6 / 2.  Division by Zero: It shows 6 / (1-1) which is 6 / 0. Division by zero is undefined in mathematics, and the animation shows this by causing chaos.  Powers: It correctly shows 6² = 36, (6+2)² = 8² = 64, (6-2)² = 4² = 16, and 4⁵ = 1024. It visually represents these large numbers with grids of '1's.  Roots & Exponents: It correctly shows 4¹ = 4, 4⁰ = 1, 4⁻¹ = 1/4. Then it shows √4 = 2.  Imaginary Unit Again: It shows √(-1) = i, reminding us of the imaginary unit.  Properties of i: Correctly shows i + i = 2i and i * i = -1. It then incorrectly shows i*i*i = -1 (it's actually -i) and i*i*i*i = e^(iπ) (it's actually 1, while e^(iπ) is -1). This leads back to the incorrect -1 = 1 before resetting.  Part 4: Visualizing Euler's Formula  The Unit Circle: This is the most visual explanation. The stick figure draws a circle on a graph (the complex plane, with real numbers left/right and imaginary numbers up/down). The circle has a radius of 1.  Rotation: It shows a point starting at 1 on the real axis. As it rotates around the circle by an angle (theta, θ), its position is given by cos(θ) on the real axis and sin(θ) on the imaginary axis. So the point is cos(θ) + i sin(θ).  The Key Angle (π): When the angle is π radians (180 degrees), the point lands exactly on -1 on the real axis. At this point, cos(π) = -1 and sin(π) = 0.  The Connection: Euler's Formula (a more general version of the Identity) states e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i sin(θ).  Putting it Together: So, if you put π in for the angle θ: e^(iπ) = cos(π) + i sin(π) = -1 + i(0) = -1. This visually demonstrates why e^(iπ) = -1.  Part 5: Advanced Representations (The Crazy Formulas)  Series Expansions: The video briefly shows the infinite series (Taylor series) for e^x, cos(x), and sin(x). These are ways to calculate these functions by adding up an infinite number of terms. It visually shows the terms for e^(iπ) adding up and spiraling towards the value -1.  Other Formulas: It flashes many other complex formulas involving integrals, the Gamma function (Γ), the Zeta function (ζ), logarithms, etc. These are all different, advanced ways mathematicians can express or relate these concepts. You don't need to understand them all; it's showing the depth and interconnectedness of mathematics around Euler's identity.  Conclusion: The Beauty of Math  The stick figure "fights" these complex formulas, gets overwhelmed, but ultimately finds peace with the simple, elegant equation: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0. It's often called the most beautiful equation in mathematics because it cleanly links those five fundamental constants. The final "exit" is just wordplay on e^(iπ).  In simple terms: The video takes us on a wild ride from basic counting, through some funny math mistakes and visual tricks, introduces advanced ideas like imaginary numbers and powers, and finally arrives at and explains (using the unit circle) the beautiful and fundamental Euler's Identity: e^(iπ) = -1.

I want a animation vs graphing. This is just the beginning
Sometimes I felt like this in class
Why does the music make it scarier than most of analog horrors? 😭
Такую анимацыю надо показывать в школах в начальных классах.
Crazy that you're still making these. I remember when Animator vs Animation was posted on deviantArt back in the day. I'll admit as a young aspiring animator back them I was a little envious. Fortunately I was a kid and grew up. But what a trip!  Congrats. Nice to see terkoiz still doing stuff. Ah the stickpage days.
i want a song of just the backround and listen to it 24/7
I got SO scared when he tried to divide by 0! That's the easiest way to destroy a universe.

SUGGESTION !!!  If this format were turned into a video game, it could be an incredibly powerful tool for teaching kids math.
The "Animation vs Chemistry/Biology" video must be next!

Hey kiddo, whats 9 + 10?
more video  plz
2:49 💀
This video always gives me inspiration to push myself in my engineering career :]
This actually made it click for me as to why you can't divide by zero.
bro this is insane animating
4:57  the imagination it takes to make math based weapons is crazy. I’m sending this to my maths teacher
I fr learnt smth from this. All from starting from 1+1
tôi rất thích toán học vì tay tôi không chịu dừng

I am really interested in a sequel that includes a lot of other math concepts like Probability, Linear Algebra and Calculus.  If you put a nonlinear differential equation with chaotic solutions into the equation solver, will you get an infinitely complex multidimensional math expression in an incomprehensible language?  Will you summon the Mandelbrot Set, the true final boss of mathematics who is far stronger than e^ipi?
V❤amazing work
stopped understanding 4 minutes in
bro explains all of elementary school math in 3 and a half minutes
1+1=1000000000000
these videos are good for learning
I heard the same sound effect in the rocket designer of a video game.
I think you should make a video game out of this. It would be fun.
Teach kids a lesson
Absolute cinema 👾
yeahh maybe i should pay more attention in school...

Loved it❤❤
Bro turn math into ww2💀
I understood nothing, yet enjoyed everything
I cried of happiness watching this video, thank you! Doing two years of further mathematics in college paid off :-) my favourite moment is when e to eye pie used the limit to fend off infinity. Huge thanks to the creator!
Wow, i'm honestly blown away by the sheer brilliance presented here, this is literally a masterpiece 🙏🏻😮

If AI can produce a video animation like this, god bless humanity 😀
i think i learned more math here than i ever learned...ever
it means the whole headache behind the math is "e"?

8:40 Huh, that's not how I would've expected a function blaster to work. (To function, if you will.) After all, a function is a machine where you put in one thing, and the function spits out a thing in response. For example, in the video, we see a function called f. This function takes in a number, takes the tangent of that number, multiplies that by 9, and spits out the result. In symbols, the function f can be defined by the equality f(x) = 9 * tan(x). As an example, we can evaluate f at the value π / 4 (or τ / 8):  f(π / 4) = 9 * tan(π / 4) = 9 * 1 = 9  So it would be cool if the function worked like this: TSC tosses a number in between the parentheses and fires the blaster, causing the function f to "eat" that number and act on it, and the result would be shot out of the other end of the equals sign. TSC could toss in the number π / 4 and fire, and a 9 would be shot out. In fact, it doesn't even have to be something with a nice result. You could very well toss, say, the number 3 into the function f, and the value f(3) is approximately -1.2829.  Of course, you do still need something to defeat the e^(iπ) creatures. In that case, you can just toss π into the function:  f(π) = 9 * tan(π) = 9 * 0 = 0  Actually, tossing in 0 would work just as well:  f(0) = 9 * tan(0) = 9 * 0 = 0  So you fire out a 0 at each e^(iπ), turning it into 0e^(iπ). That's just 0, so the e^(iπ) would be annihilated. Excellent!
4:16 Note that the equality -e^(iθ) = -cos(θ) + i sin(θ) does not always hold, but -e^(iθ) = -(cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) does, per Euler's formula. I believe that's what was meant here, so I would've preferred for parentheses to have been used in that way. In fact, it would've made the expression longer, which might have made the animation more dramatic.

7:35 Wouldn't it make more sense for the lower bound to update to the index AFTER the one that was just used? For comparison, if you have a bucket of balls labeled from 0 to 5, and you throw balls 0, 1, and 2, then the next lowest-numbered ball in the bucket should be 3. Ball number 3 should be the smallest number you see when you look in the bucket, not ball number 2.
Nah division is my worst little bit nightmare😢😢

This is so awesome. If I was shown that clip in school as a kid it would have been so easy to understand the relationships of all the mathematical things we had to learn but no one of us was understanding mathematics. We were just following the routines to solve the problems. This video really arouse my interest in some of the things I saw. Thanks to chatGPT I can now easily understand what I am seeing here 25 years after I finished school.
"WEEEEEEEH!!!" Truly inspiring battle cry.

I need this to be a videogame!! It would be cool that it's a multiplayer one and all this attacks combos. I see this as a game similar to Smash.  Also it would be great to learn about math. As a future engineer, I swear I would be playing it!!
Alanbecker become our math teacher guys
I don't get it How does Orange end up dimensions like these??
The dreams that I get on the night while sleeping cuz tomorrow is Maths exam :
Have faith in jesus
This needs a few seasons. @netflix should pick them up

I did advanced math (meaning derivatives and anti derivatives, matrices, logarithms, functions 3rd class, --- sorry I may not know the exact name, I learned them in Greek) in high school, Lyceum which is equivalent to the last three grades of high school). I lost comprehension when Euler number showed up, and as I commented on your instagram, I couldn't understand the hostility. So I gave a philosofical thought, that the poor guy couldn't understand the beauty of identities and higher maths, or better, how could he determine a world of imaginary numbers when he is coming from natural/whole/real numbers. But that is very rough interpretation and I quite old to remember so far back. In conclusion, GOD BLESS YOU, you definetely made world a better place!

Oscar level editing 👍🏼
Wait what uumm my sister showed me this one and I did not know your channel
I learnt Math!
I could follow up until the appearance of what people in the comments call "Euler's identity". After that point I could only enjoy the awesome animation and sound design, as I had no idea about most of the stuff shown.  I wish I wasn't so stupid (at least math-wise). I enjoyed the consequent videos in the series much more because I could actually appreciate the meaning of what was going on for much larger part of them.

If i ever become a math teacher im playing this for my students on a fun day then we'll get to break down all the math behind it
I love how he starts off learning easy math like addition ane subtraction like 1st grade stuff then it gets into multiplication and division like 4th grade then divids by zero  then fractions ect.
This Video deserve to be in theatre  as a 3D movie ❤🙌🏻💯
Woah
Integration and defferentiation

We need one of programming languages....  Hero learns "Hello World"... and then dives deep into methods, functions, queries and then pointers to memory locations to then go further into assembly code and reach the sea of binary, to then transcend into the electrical impulses world
So at the end the hero transcends as he mastered calculus and finally made peace with Euler's ---

This is the only cool animation made with maths

Animation vs. Math: Advanced Explanation  3:01 Another way of writing multiplication problems is... Write one of the numbers in parentheses. (Multiplication is the default operation in Algebra, and the multiplication symbol is just implied.) Example 1: 7 × 6 = 7(6) Example 2: a × b = ab (This could only work in unknown variables.) 3:04 Exponentiation –– A power that tells us how many times do we have to multiply that number. For example: 6² is multiplying 6 two times. 3:09 From 1D space to 2D space. (R¹ –> R²) 3:15 From 2D space to 3D space. (R² –> R³) 3:17 From 3D space to 4D space. (R³ –> R⁴) 3:20 From 4D space to 5D space. (R⁴ –> R⁵) 3:24 4^(5 – 1) = 4⁵ ÷ 4¹, 4^(4 – 1) = 4⁴ ÷ 4¹ and so on. 3:28 Anything raised to the power of zero is always one, because 4⁰ = 4^(1 – 1) = 4¹ ÷ 4¹ = 4 ÷ 4 = 1 3:29 Anything raised to a negative power is 1 over that number raised to a positive power. Example 1: 4^(–1) = (1/4) Example 2: 6^(–3) = (1/(6³)) 3:31 A fraction is equal to the numerator divided by the denominator. 3:36 Anything raised to a whole fraction is equal to the base itself (except zero, because dividing by zero is meaningless). 3:38 Anything raised to a half power (or (1/2)) is equal to the square root of the base. 3:39 Square Roots (or radical sign) –– The inverse of n², which a number is a perfect square. Note: Not just square roots, there are cube roots, fourth roots, fifth roots and so on. 3:43 √2 is irrational, which is approximately equal to 1.41. 3:48 √0 = 0 3:49 √–1 does not produce a real number, and mathematicians use the number "i" to represent √–1. 3:56 Complex Numbers –– An equation written as "a + bi" where "a" is the real part, and "b" is the imaginary part. 3:59 i² = –1 4:01 i³ = –i = i(–1) = ie^(iπ). So e^(iπ) emerges back. 4:14 i² × e^(iπ) = –1 × –1 = 1. It's now in the real realm. 4:16 e^(iπ) = cos(π) + isin(π) 4:22 e^(iπ) copied a "π" and put a minus sign in between them to cause the exponent to have a value of zero, and anything raised to zero is always one. 4:44 Notice that the sword crash each other to produce a sparkle of 0, because –1 + 1 = 0. 4:49 Notice that –4 sword decreases by one each time when the sword hits the +1 sword. 4:56 e^(iπ)'s sword turns into a division symbol to block the 4 then throws it to π to become (π/4). Therefore rotates it to 45°. 5:07 Notice that TSC uses "i" as a jump booster because i = e^(i(π/2)). 5:17 The dot is the origin of both the real and imaginary axis. The origin has a value of 0. 5:36 The unit circle is in its barest form. 5:43 A unit circle's circumference is approximately equal to 6.283 radians. 5:48 Each arc of a unit circle's length is one. 5:58 The Parameter Calculations of a Circle: (a) r –– The letter that stands for the word "radius", used to calculate the mass of the circle. (b) theta –– The symbol used for controlling and the radius the line inside the circle. (Notice that TSC rotates the line inside theta also refers to the line inside the circle too.) 6:34 By setting "theta" as the numerator and "r" as the denominator will result in a value that's approximately equal to 3.14, which is "π". 6:44 π = cos(π) + sin(π) 6:49 Notice how the sine and cosine functions to the unit circle (even in graphs). 7:10 By multiplying "i" to sin(π), the sine wave overlaps on the cosine wave whose value is –1. 7:18 By adding cos(π) to isin(π), we get –1, and is equal to e^(iπ), it emerges back again.  That's the Advanced Explanation. If I missed something, type in the reply section below!

10:00 eldin ring ahh boss
Instead of 15 years in school it's all of math on one 14 minute video
all i watch is about "we wont be able to solve rieman zeta function"
What does "f(•)=" mean here? What function is it?
I made the flying thing the equation for people who dont know how to type it in comments its this (iπ)^(n)/(n!) ∑_(n=12)^(∞) or this ∑_(n=12)^(∞) (iπ)^(n)/(n!)
Geometry was here…

It’s like orange wait it moves wait come back woah it’s alive get danget
And when they notice something it’s funny and cool
I love your vids Alen and I love your stick figures I keep drawing them on paper I don’t know how to do it on a computer so I just draw them on my paper and I drew like 100 papers with them and you I can’t stop
It's really nice!!!!! I love it   Please create animations vs chemistry  !

But sometimes you can do a better way to do math more than depression of Alan beker 11:30
The destruction of math is way to much then math

I would love an animation vs chemistry video!
there's something about this i really like, how it's just an endless plane of math with all these interactive mechanism-like systems for all the things in math.
Hello
Can’t wait for animation vs science😂
This shows that 1 number can go longer
Almost forgot everything in maths after all  Seriously 😳  Just remember 0 & -1

i like it  i think it is cool i wish i knew that math can you explain it in a video please and thank you.
How about turning it into a PvZ game?
The Aleph null in the background is crazy like some sort of demigod

at first it was nice but then i got a headache!
3:19 The hardest part to animate.
Thanks for this video, for me it motivates me when working on exercices❤😢
10:00 this is kinda reminding me of an Elden Ring bossfight
1 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 4 + 4 = 8 5 + 5 = 10
in 2025?
Eulers identity is the most profound thing that I have ever seen and I have no idea what it means. I’m pretty sure no one else does, either.
I finally get the formula at the end. It’s the sum of the volumes of all spheres of radius 1 from dimension 0 to infinity.
1+1=2 ?
Ah yes, 4.1-0.1!=3.14
처음숫자"1" 1=1 1+1=2 +를빼네 1을증식시킨다 12정도 한 다음2를 빼넨후 확인하니(1+1)이다. +2를또한다 20을만든뒤 +20을또한다 그렇게100을만들었지만 아무도없쥬? 툭건드렸는데 20이 40이 돼었다. 그렇게 줄이니 "1+99=100"이렇게돼있었다. 100=100과같고 100에서1을빼니99가되. 그리고1을더빼98이돼고 98을빼니0이됀다. 그리고여기서-1을빼니 -1이됀다. 근데-1을건들니 오일러등식이나온다. 아까만든공식을건드려 -1=-1가돼었다 아까처럼 또증식시킨다 -1을그렇게-2 -3..... 근디1+1+1=3이돼었다 1+1+1=3그사이 +를x로 바꿔3과3사이에 놔둬 1+1+1 +1+1+1 +1+1+1=3x3 1끝자락에( 이랑 )이게생김 3x(4)

Fr, Alan and his squad gotta be next-level geniuses if they’re out here making me catch *feelings* for freakin’ Euler’s number. Like, how you gonna make math emotional? That’s talent on a whole different wavelength. 💯
I'm so glad I waited to take calculus to watch this video, the PTSD e has given me shall never be forgiven

bro is the speedrunner of math
Please make a game out of both 'animation vs math' and 'animation vs physics'. It would be a very engaging as well as complete tool to make students fall in love with them...
10:01 so cute

I like how he started by 1+1 to math i don't even know as a 7th grader
100% Alan Becker he is the one who knows about all math
Is -1 = e^iπ
Others: oh thats how u do the cos and sin Me:oh u can fight with math💀
PLEASE MAKE THIS A GAME
Me telling the kids spooky stories at bedtime: Now go to sleep or else the math man might get you. Kids: Who’s that? Me, shows them this video: Kids: scared Me: my work here is done. Thanks Alan
animation made in desmos
A3 now. A4 must be absent. My fault. It's just... yeah.
A1 is first a2, what!!
Mm.
Aw. Missed My thing.
1. The first? Hm. Well, maybe 12 so... yeah.
Hey man what a creativity great work 👏
Now I understand why math books are always written in black on a white background, Because math writings are more scary with white text on a black background.Mathematics is already very scary

Bro learned math faster than the average human
Yah kaisa hai
Out of brain 🧠,🤔🤔🤔🤔
6:44  wait cos sin? Cos sin cossin...  BLACK FLASH
Bro this is insane
The problem is I have no idea what e^iπ (and it's related equations) is. I can follow most of the equations up till around half way, but that one stumps me early on.
oh god this video is already a year old… what happened..
E!
1 plus 1 equals 2? 3, 4!
The original stick figures is boring when is only fighting, but Alan Becker's stick figures is amazing, impressive, good, and really cool!
i learned more in those 14 minutes and 2 seconds than i did in my whole life in school
To some simple math tooo idk what is that
I glanced at this videos title for like half a second and thought the title genuinely said “autism vs meth”
If human beings find the ending of maths, does it mean that human has upgraded to a higher level and use math as our own weapon?
eiπ: yahhhhhhhh
So this is what happened before big bang!

I’m wondering if this is gonna translate into the main story in some way. There’s gotta be a reason TSC is in the middle of the void trying to leave…
And with no words used
Bro is hacking 4:58
Alan, you Just explained every math class in 14 Minutes.
im boutta get a 100 on my math test like im seeing quadratical equations and numbers and the that he opens numbers to see what goes into that number is wild
why is that function a pistol XD (if anyone has an explanation I'd love to hear it ^^)
Incredible
10:02 ok but the frickin war scream😭😭
Moral of the story" don't devide by Zero
If he didnt defeat the math monster dividing by zero im gonna be mad
can I make a game about this?
Me and my little sister fighting be like: (It all started when she comes into my room)
😂 that so cool!  Do a calculator like that exist where you can change the = and it generates a new calculation cause your ideas is crazy
I like how some of the mathematical fallacies have eerie music in the background
10:02 LOL
POV everyone:  THERES ZOMBIES. POV the math teacher with a mathematical gun💀🔥
this is something along the lines of a nightmare i had when learning about sin and cos in college, i just didn't understand, until a dream close to this, and POOF... i understood.  imagine being orange in this video
I really like your animations, how do you make them, which softwares do you use

I am working on an really important project in my engineering and I would love to know the basics of creation of such animations? I mean i should start from software? is it AE or Manim? I personally dont think this was created in Manim. Anyone can answer, would be a great help. Thanks!
what is the background music? and where can I find similar background music? please tell me 🙏🏻
watching this after first year calc hits different already

I actually had to come back to remember the rules for Square roots for class XD
it’s amazing 🎉

e Was The Last Second Chasing.
Can anyone explain the last mass destruction function. Please
aleph walking at the end: 😀
at 6:48, its totally inaccurate, heres why:   In this video, we know that π is either cos(t) + sin(t) or cos(t) × sin (t)  If we express 't' as the subject of the formula in: π = cos(t) + sin(t) π = cos(t) × sin(t)  The value of 't' will be UNDEFINABLE, just like 6÷0.    Comment here if you disagree
hocus pocus math is red

my teacher: so how did you learn math    Me: Alan Becker
You know what all math games need, a battlegrounds game. Now I know that already exists but I want one that is just like AvMath, because I want to brutally vaporize my friend with the power of Pi man, is that too hard to ask?
It’s already been a year!?
Wow..... This is already a year ago it felt just like yesterday
13:22 What do you think happened to him
I did the math and e^i𝛑-e^i𝛑=0 and 0 over anything, for example, 2i, is 0. and on the left hand side, you are basically doing (e^i𝛑*2)/2. and e^i𝛑+0=e^i𝛑.

Animation vs. Math: Basic Explanation  0:07 In the beginning of math, 1 is given as the first natural number in our number system, which may explain why natural numbers came first before complicated numbers we use today. 0:13 Equality –– A relationship between numbers and their values, even equations. 0:18 Addition –– The first of the fundamental arithmetic operations. 0:28 Repeated addition of 1s results in omitting them for multiplication. 0:35 The first appearance of 0 in the ones place, it's just a placeholder for numbers that don't have their value. 0:45 Decomposition –– A number which has their expanded form or its equivalent sum inside enclosing with the parentheses symbol in the outside. For example: 2 can be written as (1 + 1). 0:49 Adding numbers that are greater than 1 can also be omitted by just adding 1. 1:10 Simplification –– In some math equations, they can (or can't) simplify their equations. For example:  40 + 68 + 35 = 108 + 35                       = 143 1:23 Subtraction –– The second of the fundamental arithmetic operations. 1:31 Any number subtracts itself is always 0. 1:33 If 0 subtracts 1 (or more numbers), a negative number is born (–1).  Which is the opposite side of the positive numbers. Therefore, the positive, negative and zero became known as "integers". 1:39 This is Euler's Identity: –1 = e^(iπ) 1:49 ie^(iπ) is equal to –i and this leads to imaginary realm. 2:12 Subtracting negative numbers gives us even bigger negative numbers. Note: Adding negative numbers gives us even smaller negative numbers. So we can think of subtraction as "negative addition". 2:15 Multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive number. 2:24 Multiplication –– The third of the fundamental arithmetic operations. 2:26 If a number on the right side has brackets (or parentheses) results in factors of the product. 2:35 Division –– The fourth of the fundamental arithmetic operations. Note: Division symbols can have three types (÷, / and :). The ÷ symbol is (usually) used in math equations, the / symbol is used in fractions. For example: 1/2 = 1 ÷ 2, and the : symbol is often used in ratios. For example: a:b = a/b or a ÷ b. 2:36 This is called long division, that means you have to take the divisor's number and subtract the dividend on how many times that will take you to 0. 2:48 Dividing any number by 0 doesn't make any sense, because when we use "n" and divide by 0 will just be n – 0 – 0 – 0 – 0... It will take you forever but the dividend is still the same. And that's why n ÷ 0 is undefined. 2:57 Adding or subtracting zero from a number will not change that number's result. So this is why zero is the additive identity.  And that's the Basic Explanation. If I did something wrong, tell me in the reply section below!

If this was a game i would play it for SURE
Utilize these tools for the good of humanity. Use that negative value to your advantage! Don't let negative exponents drive you to disaster.

So...   when are you going to make a video game out of this?  Like, Superliminal-style? I'll build it for you in Unreal.
I always loved your animations  I wish i had that skill😢
There are more than 40,000 victims in Gaza so far, and about 70 percent of them are children and women. Hundreds of victims every day. There is no water or food, so the people of the north have come to eat tree leaves. Israeli bombing destroys homes every day, and hundreds of people lie under the rubble of destroyed homes for days, screaming for help. Children become skeletons and die of hunger. Gaza is being wiped out. Save Gaza❤
This is exactly what it feels like to solve physics problems.

thank you been looking for something like this to visualize learning for my 4 and 5 year old
Not gonna lie I was able to figure out that 1=1. But 1+1=2? Now that's asking for a bit much don't you think?
I feel smarter now
😮😮😮
Accident, Accident, At division 2:34 (If we take (6) as 6 books, and we practically separate the 6 books 3 by 3, we find that on subtracting 3 from 6 two times we get pair of books equal to 3, whereas the pair of books should have been of 2.  Conclusion,  The minus rule tells you how many times you have subtracted 3. However, when you look at it practically to see how large one part is, confusion arises. You might think that each part will be of size 3 because you are subtracting 3 each time, but the division answer is 2, because when you divide 6 books into 3 equal parts, each part contains 2 books.   Conclusion: The minus rule is mathematically correct, but it interprets division from the perspective of "times" (how many times subtraction occurs), whereas in the practical world, division is understood from the perspective of the size of each part.   This is why confusion arises when we mix practical division (partitioning) with theoretical repeated subtraction.)

Please do it again
“AHHHHHHHHHH” said by e truly incredible 10:02
頭良くないと出来ないのよこれは つまりAlanさんはマジで頭がいい
It should be called “Animation vs Algerbra”
I am learning 6 grade math in grade 4
When you realize this was already 1 year ago…
Is art...
You! Are! My! GOD ! ! ! ! !
Pov if coolmath games was a video:
I don't understand why there is so much hate towards Terrence Howard..... xD
How has it already been one year..
This how Maths work in my head 😂😂
This is amazing!

This is the single greatest thing to come out of youtube
Man, I appreciate the time, effort and hard work that y'all put in each and every one of these videos! They're so awesome, keep up the great work!
Go to New Math     0:57 1×33=*8*r=100  3:50 Zen¹<N × 34 = e [Eseeu⁴⁵] = i             5:11 i×i×i 400_300 [200] = •  That's is😊
If someone created a game that uses math in a fun way like in this video (Adventure-Survival game), it would help a lot of kids that struggle to learn math like I did for a lot of years. The same way Minecraft introduced me to the english language and its more common words through a friendly environment that helped me learn with time and perserverance. Amazing video

Home run ah moment 8:13
Oh
Greatness greatness
13:31 the friends
e turned into Σ💀
This Is Why I Love Math
Yeah...i know one equation A=πr²
This is possibly the most creative visual representation of Math I've ever seen! Absolutely amazing!
Σ who can see this alfabet(sigma) im sub him/her
vidéo amateur, et a appris beaucoup de nouvelles😂❤
11:26 next time instead of nothing have the other world as english
Alan Becker is great
Or
2 characters discovered.  amination vs math (this guy) animation vs geometry  now 3 more unknown characters bonus: animation vs physics clone. animation vs geometry (the monster i mean) hmm what is next....
10:02       A cute scream of e❤❤
i love orange's little reactions to discovering new stuff he can do with the numbers😭
good animation
Bro is becoming a teacher
Orange is the leader for a reason . Cuz he is the smartest
10:59 no tiene sentido x100. ¿Me puedes explicar como TSC se pasó de matarse a jefes del pre hard mode sin haber tocado nunca el calamity en su vida a matarse a yharon sin siquiera haberse matado a la muralla de carne sin siquiera haber sabido de su existencia? Como que 14 minutos de animación es extramadamente resumido y se queda bien corto.
10:34 no tiene sentido
I learned more here then what i learned in school in 7 years
Bro meant business from 11:00 he never cared about e's dimension
Why are the sound effects so good!
What did the Euler's identity equation do at the end with the -1? Did he just murder him?
sigma 😝😝🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Algebra 3 - 5 = -2 (negative two) -1 is called (negative one) 0is called (zero) 1 is either called one for short of positive one
Or statistics
Please do anime ft programming
As someone in middle school when he broke pi into cos and sin my mind broke
alguien habla español
Bro this is fire i love it so much bro  The sound on when is puts things togenther is so cool
im not even good at math but this guy teaches me everything
I just wanna thank this video for getting me into math
no way, i watched this and something actually clicked in my head
👏
Bro harnessed the sun at the end

I know I am very late here but this is one of those amazing things you see in a month. pure genius...
this made math Entertaining.. HOW??
wow I  love it
1+1=2
This s is wut I think is next animation vs history and I like history cus it is very sigma and rizzfull and I have Alabama because my sister is 5 years old and I like yes
Revisiting this vid filled with envy because I’m trying to second check a thing I did, but am finding it impossible to properly formulate and combobulate a way to check or even calculate it! I’ll posit the thing here.   If you could create a stasis field of slowed down time to the point that a cesium atom would only fluctuate once in a century of time outside the field, would it be 2.4 internal days for 66 million years to pass outside the field? Or would it be a different amount of days? To be clear the 66 million years is the part I’m keeping static, yes this involves dinosaurs.

Math teacher:hey kids!today we’re gonna play a vr game! Kids/students:REALLY?!WHAT GAME! The game:
TSC is around 10 years old, and he’s already understanding all of the math shown in the video.  Imagine listening to a 10 year old explaining to you what euler’s formula is, because personally, I would think they were a genius. 😭
6 years of not getting division, all that and I get it just now. Thanks becker
why does orange have beef with  e tho?
Math? No.  A flipin' warfare, wich could be produced as a game and be sold over billion copys? Yeaaaa
JESUS LOVES YOU❤
Cool math premium be like:
We should have calculators with these animations
me was a kid used calculator:
90+6=99
END א
Did orange get stuck in the calculator?
there should be a game that just works exactly like this, id spend hours on it
̆
e  iπ
Please make animation vs quantum mechanics
Now Eulers number is good now
Eulers number is mean to orange
If math was as fun as this I would NOT mind learning it.

Dude you used cosine and sine in a way I didn't know was possible I didn't know they were used for like creating spiral layers I thought they were in triangulation not annihilation
l love orange but so much l love all stick figurs
I’m such a Neanderthal. Why is e the bad guy?
I still remember when he posted the animation vs phousy that day was my family mary day
I just saw “א”
Mathematics is nice but I can't remember how did I pass the exams

The coming is mark rover
Bro this turned into a boss battle at 10:01
as a math major in my first year i am utterly terrified 😭😂 tsc got a much better grasp of math within 14 minutes than i have my entire life oh boy

Incredable!!!
Plus goes to minus minus goes to times and times goes to divided divided goes to Equal
eulers identity is indeed one annoying sob to work with

This is what would have been playing inside Ramanujan mind all the time , probably.
LLELO HOLA
I Love Alan Becker!!!!!
I really want more stick figures in there! (Blue stick figure, Red stick figure, Orange stick figure, Green stick figure and Yellow stick figure) I LOVE your videos!! They. Are. AWESOME!!!!!
They should be in Baldi's Basics

if school made math lessons this fun i wouldve been the smarest man alive
In 2:28 it's interesting
How does this dude know math so well I’m literally questioning life-
Wish if it could be turned into a game
Now prove every equation in this video💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
You could make more videos like this, it's very entertaining and interesting.

It would be great if we could learn math this fast no need for years of work on it in school
I’m an atheist and this was probably the most religious experience I’ve ever had. 😂AWESOME VIDEO, MAN!

Guys, Imagine if YOU can play with math like this. Its gonna be so much fun right?
fantastic, the way math should be taught, posted in my blog, thank you
if phi was in this video at the end, and also the main character in geometry, doesent the mean that delta and zeta will have another apereance too? maybe also aleph?
Выучил математику болше чем школе
Alan becker belike: hmm lets use a calculator
before is easy but affter........ sooo hard bro!!!

its so satisfying how it feels like he's tactically reloading with the sound effects, like if it sounded like that when i did math i wouldnt have failed college math

The more I watch this the better it gets   This video should get an oscer or some epic viral    This makes math so fun 😁 better then most math teachers
एनीमेशन से गणित सबसे अच्छा है 😮😮😮😮😮😮
E always runs out the DOOR
great！！！
Orange is my favourite colour❤
I'm learning more in this than I'm learning in calculus
i love that the more problems he solves, the close he gets to catching Euler’s identity, as well as understanding it. so cool.  (i’m bad a math im probably referring to it incorrectly)
better than marvel
I show this to my students at the beginning of each school year and they love it!!

This is destroying math with math
One time last year, on November i think... My math teacher saw this, so every single day that had math, and every single break, we watched it for fun, now im on a new school, im going to send this to my friends, i hope they remember this :)
Crazy how all that came from just a simple 1

He made a gun out of an equation and it's going to tactical reload it or something there is nothing this guy can't do never fight him or else you will be defeated with everything😂😂😂 8:37
It’s crazy that it’s already been a year since this was made
Dude, randomly saw a short of this and checked out the full video. Definitely made my Sunday! Love this! Not gonna lie, I thought it was a clip of a video game… this needs to become a video game
11:19 Why the truck sound

0:14 hahaha 😂😂😂😂😂 you can see this then you no comments be you can see 1+1=2 0:39
2 + 2 = 4 - 1 = 3 Quick maths!
Teacher: The math can save your life! Me watching this: Thank you, teacher.
e^
I saw and knew your animation made it to my school! (Math Club used your animation and credited you) I was surprised that my Math teacher (woman) would actually put this in our school in the midst of people crowding, I watched your animation through the Math Club's TV, it's incredible and fascinating that you combined stick figurine animation, math and made them into a fighting, entertaining video! This is so cool 👏 Congratulations 🎉

The fact that I recognized A LOT of mathematical concepts in this video, has shown to me that I actually did learn math in school.  Next video is gonna have to touch the 3rd dimensional plane as well as adding more  mathematical concepts such as partial derivatives. Now you’re messing with time, then eventually it touches physics
❤⚡️♾️
Hold up one of the symbols at the end showed up in the latest episode maybe next time we’ll see the 3
I just watched the geometry one and watched this again I’m wondering if we’re going to see all of them meet orange because we seen one of the characters in this go into geometry

This is the most beautiful video I have ever seen on YouTube

7 min ; mistake or clumsy ? : invertion of sin and cos ... (normally we see sin vertically and cos horizontally) - but the curve associted are correct - so i would just sau clumsy - anyway great job ; wp
When I do the square root of -1 I always get an error message, not e^i Pi. How did Alan figure this out?
And teachers complain that their students hate math Because you don't know the way how to teach them.

How to learn math while having fun :
Glad that his still making animation on YouTube.

When we ask teachers how does maths apply in life This is the answer
Netflix should call him
10:58  Bro forgot to hold back
You had a good math teacher if they taught you with this.
It got passed trig and pre-call and then I got lost but it was still fun
I think he's multiplying numbers
Found a clip of this on Facebook. I’m glad I searched it, this was way too cool. Might be the coolest animation I’ve ever seen. The sounds the fighting was so damn clean
Loved It !

For me, the pischick and the math are similar because the two lines have numbers, what happens is that the ball on the i makes a line of any shape, while in the pischick, whatever makes lines The magnet has stripes of colors like red and blue, but it cannot make the ball of the i because it does not have the colors of red and blue, unlike the magnet that also has the colors of the i in the math.

I love the suspense about "how many times we have to take 0 to get 6?" 2:48
This math are so advanced
Oh he wanted to get out. I thought orange guy just threw hands at Euler for not reason the whole time.
who needs animations we got mathimations
2024 anyone?? 👇
I still feel dumb
Bro made the perfect circle before humans did... (not including tools to help make one)
This is complicated for the ones who don't really know some math like me 😅
7:58 Bansho Tenin 💀
WWEEEEEEE
I voiced all your videos
The power of infinity is insane 🤯
@merthoca Hocam şu vidoyu biraz yorumlayabilir misiniz bence eğlenceli olur
I will never see Euler’s number the same way again lol
4+5=9
Mind-blowing
The video started showing us hard math because of the number 1

Amazing,bro has described whole math development in just a video from basic addition to quantum computation,,,salute to this skill
e^-i²log(1-i) and e^2i²log((1-i)/(1+i))
Can you imagine if a teacher played this in class? im willing to bet everyone would watch
My math teacher actually showed this to my class

one of the most creative videos of all time like bro how
I love these so much. Will there be more? Animation vs Statistics pleeeaaase xxx
e^ used domain expansion circle of doom..! 7:53
I swear to God, ever since this video came out, almost all of the nerds on the internet who knows everything shown here, reacted to it.
I can't believe I'm gonna say this but match is beautiful 😭
4:19 - Flip
I keep coming back to this video as I learn more math and it just keeps getting better!
You need to collab with Mike Salcedo for Number Lore
This is how i imagine numbers in my head while solving math..absolutely loving thissssssss
hard to believe this was a year ago
It all started with a 1
Well whats next math (replace maths A with e :)
can u please make an animation vs programming pleaseeee
NERDS AND ARTISTS UNITE!
*school* teaches with white boards and paper *no* *alan becker* teaches with mini stick figures and animation *perfect*
The answer is 2

are we going to see the others? because we saw the golden ratio in animation vs geometry (if u didn't, you should) so are we going to see the other thing(s)
10:52 gorilla tag
I could see this being like a video game  Kind of like an MMORPG but in order to get stronger you have to understand more complex maths
10:02 WEAAAAGGHH that war cry was so majestic
Euler was a good antagonist
Bro what did I just watch this was insane
Why not make animation versus ROBOTS!
But it all started with just the number 1...
i know only 2+2=22
yo i didnt understand a single thing
I am a high school student, I was able to understand the references up to 7:28, I hope I will understand the rest in the future.

Hello I am big  fan of this channel after seeing the mathematical video on this channel, very interesting animation outstanding,   Please one video on , Riemann Hypothesis and  Hodge Conjecture  ❤❤❤❤❤🌹🌹🤗🤗❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I fell asleep while watching this video and now I get why I suck at math
Underated
It's unfortunate you think that basic algebra = maths, but I suppose the maths school system has failed us. Enjoyable animation though!
can't wait for `Animation vs. Ordinals` where you get to draw infinities of infinities of infinities
Thank You....!❤....

Honestly this is one of my favorite YouTube videos of all time, I watch it literally every 2 weeks. I am quite a big math nerd in high school, and having so many math concepts ranging from simple operations to advanced calculus… it is really such a treat. Thank you so much to the Alan Becker team for putting this together, I look forward to many more masterpieces in the future!

imagine how much more powerful the lazer would've been if tsc *applied the infinite thing to it*
What's the ost used? It's so cool
IMO this should’ve been the finale to animation vs a random school subject, since math is basically everywhere. It would’ve all lead up to this.
animation vs math, physics, geometry..... whats next?
This is better than my math teacher lol
Time flies, IT'S BEEN A YEAR
Too good to learn math!
The path to enlightenment has been opened.
Absolutely incredible animation, I love all the math symbols and equations for detail. Amazing
I have a question if you have any idea how much it is
They didn't go into base of the numbers, padic numbers Also showing sum of infinite natural numbers is -1/12 would be amazing
what site/app do you use
So creative
When you see the golden ratio in that video,the golden ratio was in animation vs geometry,its the same
AMAZING!!! Do "Animation vs. Chemistry" please!
Did he go to school?
OMG
🥶🥶
No math teacher can teach me as much as this video did
I LOVE MATH❤
This is like a interstellar movie

Why Tsc?
Crazy how I understand half of it which means I do focus in math class 😨
i learned all 11 grades in 14 minutes

soo good
What's with the 2 numbers on top of Euler's head?
What happen to his friends or is this just a test you couldn't solve?
I havent seen this in a year❤

I can’t believe this is already a year ago, time flies man…😢
he is god
10:02 look at e screaming
bro I wish math was like this
In the end it shows zeta, phi, delta, and aleph. In this animation we see  euler's identity, in animation vs geometry we see phi. Will the next animation show the other 3; zeta, delta, and aleph?
Now *this* is how to teach math in school
Math isnt that scary.. the math:
These videos are epic this stuff is really incredible I love the use of all theses principles acting through animation this stuff needs to be in schools

How has it already been a year since this dropped?
No matter how many times I'm watching this video time and time again, I begin looking for simpler explanations on the internet when eiπ appears, and am constantly lost starting from 3:15 and beyond until I search for simpler explanations again.  The effort is there, nothing's wrong with the animation level, but it's 100% my least favourite video and series ever because there is literally no fun in watching and fail to enjoy your usual animations when I am too focused on trying to keep up the pace, pause everytime something doesn't make sense to me, having to grasp the so-called logics out there and so on.  That's the problem with maths and why I always hated them (always loved history and the real knowledge you gain from it is way more useful than just numbers).  Because once someone tries to explain you how maths works in their own way/perspective (as in this video) is literally forcing you to start from scratch and have to understand how maths work but from a different perspective, which makes all the small and hard earned things you bothered to try to remember become outdated and useless, so what's the point.  Like it wasn't difficult enough with the "more common and general" view of maths that you get teached at school, which I can say that I'm not missing at all and don't recall maths being useful to me ever since I began working.

this video is 1 year old. i'm mentally hurt.
I love the fact that imaginary numbers are key to another dimension
why don't the eπi's just turn into eπi+eπi-eπi? are they stupid?
When school starts ill show my math teacher and ill tell you what she rated it out of ten
Idk if I lost or gained brain cells with this

Did you use pivot ??
If he put a multiplication sign and a 2 together and touched himself, would it duplicate him? We know from him adding to his legs that he can use math on himself, so would that work?

bravo…
That is so cool and I want animation vs math part 2 and there orange stickman will return home and tell the others about the math world they will come there and find e and the others from the end of the video and build a math city with military walls and weapons to defend the city from the letter monsters and meet the letter boss and kill it

animation vs. chemystry please
Bro, wake up, it was 1 year ago...
Sí 1+1=2 eso es muy fácil🔥🔥🔥
11:29 soft & wet go beyond 👍🏿👍🏿
i'll be honest, watching them mess with numbers is oddly satisfying. though is this all happening within a calculator or something?
I just realized...     Euler's identity is just a tutorial of how to kill a negative number...
-cos+isin=e
at 5:12 i thought he was gonna use it to make decimal numbers
1e100=googol 1e1e100= googolplex

I didn't go to school today so I'm gonna learn math with this video
Is that phi how is in the math

Deus não existe.
change the “r=100” in the end into a Infinity Symbol and see what happens 😈
Its like that orange is so good and smart!, and Alan your cool to!!!!❤
So excited that phi got a video!
We do get to see one of the sines in animation vs geometry. It’s the cycle with the line through it (I don’t know the name of it, feel free to tell me!) so we may be seeing the others in the future. Or not, I don’t know .
13:35 oh look, there's Phi from the latest video "Animation Vs Geometry"!
@alanbecker  so, is animation vs geometry the prequel?

They went from addition to eulers identity to multiplication 💀
8:46 wait, why is the tan function zeroing the e^i*pi
The early stages of this remind me of playing with a calculator at school, doing random calculations xD
they should just put on these videos to teach kids math
one of youtube's rare gems
Showing my math students this at the beginning of the year to get them interested 👀
I can't believe this masterpiece was 1 year ago... Time really does fly by
If I was stuck in a black void and had to depend on math to get out, I'd be stuck there forever.
Алан, ты меня поражаешь
Orange flipping when they were hit with the negative sign made me burst out laughing; it was so unexpected to see as a gag.
Returning here not just to rewatch this masterpiece, but also to confirm that Phi has appeared before (believing that Phi had seen TSC before meeting him in Animation vs. Geometry, which is why Phi is friendlier/less defensive when they met than Euler's identity)
7:35 ∑_"n=0" ^"∞" ▒("iπ" )^"n" /"n!"  made from Window word 2013

See, if Math could let me do THAT kinda stuff. I would’ve actually payed attention in algebra.
Whoever developed math put a hell of a lot of work into it
Euler, you're being irrational! Literally.
I don’t even know how I got entertained by math
So this is why Phi is so friendly in Animation vs Geometry: he already got the low-down from e that TSC is cool.
Anybody realized the guy from animation versus geometry is there 13:35
we need a science and a english one

A psychiatrist is walking through a hospital for crazy mathematicians. An aggressive psycho approaches him. He told him - I will integrate you. The psycho got scared and ran away. Moves on. Another aggressive patient arrives. He tells him - I'll differentiate you. The psycho got scared and ran away. The doctor moves on. The third patient stepped out in front of him threateningly. The doctor tells him: I will integrate you. Zero reaction. I'll differentiate you! Zero reaction. Are you not afraid of me at all? Why? Because I am e to the power of x.
I bet he’s asking siri
Damn if Math worked like that in real life, it would be an endless battle with numbers.
This is the type of thing you would get some friends over and watch together while high
This animation is already 1 year old. Time flies so fast 😭
what's the math
good animation
i find it interesting that there's a suspense build at 2:51, implying that eventually some THING would have come down from that...
my brain hurts

Ореннің бұл -1 , 1+ , π ,  × ,  дегенді үйрене бастағаны өте керемет, Алан Беккер Король Орен баласын немесе әпкесін тапқанда анимация жасады, мен толық пакетпен бірге тапсырамын деп уәде беремін, егер ол толық пакет болмаса да, үй өртеніп жатыр.
Me trying to solve "life":  3:12 Also, who voice acted the e?
POV: The group chat got leaked
e:waaaa! ❤😂 Also I like ur videos 😊
did the orange disapeared in the end?
This and the Phyics Video definitely has a lot of potential of visually teaching math. Someone has to make this into a game.
Wow so cool😀
Hey! The “They see me rolling” part reminds me of bowling.
you guys from 2024
...
When will there be “animation vs programming”?

whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat is this
THIS INSPIRED ME TO LEARN MATHS WHAT
똑똑똑
Alan is Our new math techer. Congrats😁
4:44   Love how bigger numbers hit harder😂 Even here 7:28 8:03 puts negative onto himself to appear from the other side
how did you do that that is incredible
This invites me to deepen my knowledge.
I understand all math by this video
why am I learning from this
This is how Youtube Oldtime looklike
Why is there a modern Hebrew aleph at the end of the video? Is it used in math?

That was fr good
The math is not mathing

I dont understand but it's very exciting
I'm a second grader but I know a lot (plus minus times ÷ 2 3 and √
THAT WAS AWESOME OMG YOU MADE ME LOVE MATH MORE THANKS❤❤❤❤

So cool!
I really wanna know what all of that math means, and how it relates to the actions they enable…  🤔 I wonder if you have a video where you pause it to explain what’s happening…

I love coming back to this cause I love math and seeing it used like this is just awesome, but what I like more is the sound used whe. The equations change.

11:05 THIS PART IS CRAZY
amazing job
This should be recommended to everyone.
i read that as animation vs met-
It wasn't about the journey. It was about the functions we made on the way.

Why is there big N at the end what does that stand for
i once got my maths teacher to play this at school

"Euler,  It's long time we not met, how are you there? I'm curious about your universe but i don't know how to get there..again?. Wish you had a happy life."  - Your humble integer orange buddy -
I love this. Little guy learned how to fight!
12:23 yall here in 2024? Anyways if you dont know what that means, TSC is arranging the word *_exit_* with math alphabet  e×iπ exit
Это лучшее, что я видел

bro just taught me whole maths better than my damn maths teachers
cos(π)+isin(π)=eiπ
Artık bu videoyu her izlediğimde seni hatırlatıycam🙃

You don't know how much i want 1 video like this but is like "Animation vs music"
I've always hated math, but this is so freaking mesmerizing that, in my 30's, I might consider studying it just to understand it better...
unbelievable
Alan deserves an Oscar award
10:02
I like how tsc made infinite laser gun just because he wasnt greeted well
2:50 I was hoping for him to divide by zero and open a black hole or something
11:05 Ah yes, my favorite equation, the "f*** you beam"
Seeing this i had amazing ideas for video games, but sadly i can't program.

This vid is so awesome 🎉🎉🎉🎉
This made math look so fun. It reminds me of the element combination games where you start off with the four basic elements and try to make as many things as possible. Maybe if calculators were like this people would be able to explore and learn a little better with numbers
litterally math to mathamatics
Wow so cool makes me wish that I had  learned more.
Orange could create a wall of binary code at this point

That scream was soo funny 🤣 in 10:03
Bro be doing intense math to make this-💀
Bro made a death star

from where are you take sound effects ? Plz tell ke bro
Это должно быть представлено к награде 🎖️
Я боюсь представить какой титанический труд стремящийся к бесконечности был вложен в эту анимацию со всеми просчётами, звуком, раскадровокой, эффектами, музыкой, анимацией и логикой.😮  Опладирую стоя.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Animation vs SCP
i never thought math could be and look so cool
This gives me the same vibes as the old Stick Fight games combined with Captain Bones from Crashbox! I love this so much ❤
cos(π)+isin(π) is δφζ arrive to א like eiπ are morden greek and numbers to symbols
My kids (7 and 10) asked me to watch this video over and over. Now they want me to explain it all \o/

Who is watching in 2024
Yeah a wonderful animation alan bro
You😢 know e^iπ=-1 +0i it goes -1at starting this fellow got it as 1
That is amazing.
I thought 1+1=grass not 2
the sqrt. is it square root or squirt?
2=2+443
love your videos i was born to be your fan
Math isn't actually real, it's a construct made by ancient people. Instead of a concrete thing, math is actually just a set of patterns continually being built upon by humanity.
7:52 Bro even got his own domain expansion💀
14:02
OMG ITS VERY GOOD
Pov: you want to make a content from math

Dide you don't even know whta you did this video change my life and the way i see math o just learn it now
But why did they have to fight.
i dont think even einstein could understand this much math from completely zero in *fourteen literall minutes*
YO MY MATH TEACHER SHOWED US THIS ANIMATION ON THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL
What is e^iπ?
Bro made a orbital cannon

Who let bro cook in math? 💀💀💀 i think even Einstein is proud of him
All i can think about is my math teacher's reaction to this.
As sum1 who hates math, I have no words to describe how brilliant this is.
Although the Euler's identity was the main antagonist of the video, Orange just wanted to return where he was.  This is still an extremely unique and spectacular animation!!!!!!!!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This is the most IRRATIONAL and IMAGINARY video that I ever seen!
This is how math was founded
But what happened at the end. He gave his World to e n transported to another world?
Math is indeed powerful
DOMAIN EXPANSION!!!  INFINITE MATH!!!
I cannot get maths Sorry
So before going to college I didnt really get most of this, but now that I am entering Calculus I hate how much I understand lmao
10:57 bro hit the domain expansion: infinite math
you went from creating incredible content for children and teenagers to incredible things for adults
ayo ngl alan you should make like shorts or a whole video of like mods and all that like alex's mobs or some weapon stuff
You deserve a subscribe
Now, Please make  video on  Animation VS Chemistry
This was brilliantly awesome! ... makes me sad that I never followed my OG plans out of high school to go to Uni for mathematics. Too late to worry about that now, lived a good deal of life since then now that I'm in my 40s.
Ok but that e sacrifice his life and made the circle thingy bigger for TBC

5:37 geometry student here- I don’t deal with graphing Sine and cosine functions on a graph, but know what they represent. It really made me tingle inside when I saw the representation. Thanks!

Why eiπ is Running away from TSC?

1+1 2
Advanced Mathematics and Advanced Programming Senior in high school and I can 100% agree that everything that was depicted that I understood is accurate. Funniest thing is recursion in trigonometric functions, which leds to e and π reappearing the further you decompose them. Same applies when trying to do integers using said functions and/or values, which it just loops back to the original integer.
eiπ❤🥰
Absolutely amazing, i  wish someone would have taught Mathematics like that during my childhood. This is a true masterpiece.❤
Let’s do another animation battle but it chemistry.

I genuinely think I am going to make a game inspired by this. I think it would be soooo cool!
Such creativity. You got some unique qualities.

Till 13:00 I understand everything. Well, looks like I have to learn something new to understand the whole video)) Thank you.

This was fire!
Literally the only thing beyond the basics I saw coming was the square root of -1.
Everybody gangsta till that Euler appeared
Every thing Started from Number One1️⃣
Wait Alan Becker had to understand all of this before making this?
query. at 10:58~ He multiplies the radius by 10 = 100 But shouldn't he (and the focal point/center of the grid) still be central? why is it that the grid appears to expand expressly upwards, not uniformly around him? we can see at 11:07 that he is expressly off center.
Love the little detail at 4:20 of TSC flipping his facing direction when hit by the negative sign.
This became first just using math then a whole fight using math  What other content did I miss
10:00 *OMƏGA* 'The Divider'
Por mais que seja tão fácil parece ser tão difícil  O problema  é que n9is n prestamos atenção (preguiça)

dividing by 0 shouldof been the thing to destroy the realm
God, I have a lot to learn 😅
I love the Alef at the end
Never thought I would see a number push someone away by extending to -cos(pie)+isin(pie)
Very fun video!
Now I understand math😂

Marvelous... I can only bow down to the art, knowledge, skill and creativity of this video. As a physicist, I can understand all the math, but to stage it like this is the work of a genius whose mind can grasp, see and imagine more dimensions than probably most of us. Thank you for this enchanting 15 minutes... which I will probably watch many, many times. A jewel.
Genius
allen becker
This would make the most epic game, teenagers instead of saying have you found the dungeon yet,  Instead kids would be saying have you found the function yet
Am I a genius for being in 5th grade and understanding this
... Bro u good ?
This should be one of those animated shorts that plays before a movie in theaters
Magnifico
0:48
They should make a video game out of this. And let children play it. I see future of mathematical education in this.
Loved the cute little battle cry and uncoordinated woobly circular spin of the giant transformer Euler. 😂
Alan  teached 50 years math...
1:39 welcome e to the I pie :)
Noice.    i might just consider learning more about math   just MAYBE.

Well that escalated exponentially
Math lore
8:30 so funny
it's a very cool detail to make aleph a giant (he's both a finite and infinite numbers, the infinite being aleph null as far as i know)
It’s crazy how all of this came from the number 1
E=mc²
if only math homework was this fun in real life.
Thank you for this.
Sadly this was based on a true story of a schizophrenic math professor. Identity disorder is no joke guys 😞
Average day in the life of a math student

Bro was given 10 minutes to learn math and he made a weapon that can destroy the universe
curiosity is so dangerous yet so fascinating.
Is there a part 2?

What is 0.25 radius used for? A. Creating pi B. Creating i C. Creating tan
erm, what the Σ?

I wish this is how I learned math
I would imagine a mathematician is able to picture all of this in their head. Adjusting a certain X number in the equation would produce Y result. That they're able to deduced the equation quickly.
This video is Fire! why i wasn't intro to this earlier...
this video is cool, but why is TSC in the void?
Symbols friends but x are biggest 😮
You can't tell me this isn't effin magic
Bro uses his domain expansion with that circle he made.

I love this animation for everything and btw I know in 2024 until 4:15 guess my age :)
Incredible. You are a masterpiece. POV: Why you should subscribe to alan becker?
Bro has beef with e 💀💀💀💀
Why is euler identity so pissed?😊
I just recently learned some of the more complicated stuff in here, and watching it again with that knowledge makes it even better somehow
What were the other ones that were with E
I think I figured it out.  TSC is on his god arc.
Love How He Discovered \0 Before Anything Else
Confused this math 😢😢
I learned more about math in these 14 minutes than in 12 years of school and 3 years of colli.
My favorite part about this whole animation is how people keep saying "if math lessons were like this, everybody would do math!"  Little do they know, math DOES do this. For example: The computer running the animation as a video known as a phone or computer embodies about 90% of these formulas. Without them, we wouldn't be able to do graphics, we wouldn't be able to do circuits, or any of it.  The computer that RENDERED the animation embodies all of the formulas shown in the video.  The bridge you walk over, the house you live in, everything is made up of math. Math is the language of those who build, either for themselves, or for others. You can't run a country without finances, and how do you calculate those finances? How do you make the computer that calculates those finances, or the software that uses that computer?  Math is boring until it's not. Once it stops being boring, it is incredible. :)

You can't just shoot a hole into the surface of Math
Just realized im gonna slowly understand this video with school, just learned about exponentiation and square roots.
As an engineering student, this is one of the coolest things ive ever seen

bro has iq
Imagine if he came back to to his friends bro would be smart and win diffrent battles like seriously
Mr. Becker,  this is awesome.  I teach high school math.  My first day, the students sit down and before I say anything, I play this while I pass out all the stuff they need.  It is a perfect video to set the tone for the year.  Now I teach geometry.  If you made a geometry specific one,  that would be sweet.  Thanks.
It is as great as Avenger movie
Are...  Are you trying to get me into math?                                  Because it's working.
Did TSC become Aleph?  Edit: oohhhhh he asked Euler's number for an "e × i t", i see. Then Euler transformed his circle pi gun into a hypersphere by locking itself as the circle's point of origin, then making TSC the point, and adding more dimensions into it. THEN Euler teleported him using the square root of -1 so that instead of goimg to the world of imaginary numbers, the hypersphere would send him to the physics dimension.
Math is so friggin cool. I absolutely love this
Just thinking about this starting with a 1

man, you're just incredible.
I understood everything except the notation f(•) with the backwards arrow and what happened when he plugged in infinity. Would anyone care to explain also why it added dimensions to the span?
Sooooooo. Is a music variant of this possible???
I'm gonna make an oc off of this rq
I sooooooo wanna make a game like this!
Coming out of a pre calc class, this is extremely impressive to how all of it is accurate 💀💀💀
If math was like this. I would’ve had an A+ the entire year.

I realized when TSC grabs a number, when the number splits, the last thing holding them both together is an equal(=) sign. Since at that split moment, it shows the equation #=#. Such a nice touch.

to see that, makes learning math way more easier!
when you had -1 why did you tap it then turn to e tt?

To find  𝜋 π from this equation, we can follow these steps:  Start with Euler's identity: 𝑒 𝑖 𝜋 + 1 = 0 e  iπ  +1=0  Subtract 1 from both sides to isolate the exponential term: 𝑒 𝑖 𝜋 = − 1 e  iπ  =−1  Take the natural logarithm ( ln ⁡ ln) of both sides to solve for the exponent  𝑖 𝜋 iπ: ln ⁡ ( 𝑒 𝑖 𝜋 ) = ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) ln(e  iπ  )=ln(−1)  Using the property of logarithms that  ln ⁡ ( 𝑒 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 ln(e  x  )=x, we get: 𝑖 𝜋 = ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) iπ=ln(−1)  The natural logarithm of -1 is  𝑖 𝜋 iπ because in the complex plane,  ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) ln(−1) can be represented as  𝑖 𝜋 iπ: ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) = 𝑖 𝜋 ln(−1)=iπ  Therefore, we have: 𝑖 𝜋 = 𝑖 𝜋 iπ=iπ  To explicitly solve for  𝜋 π, we can start from this known relationship and rearrange:  From the known fact  ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) = 𝑖 𝜋 ln(−1)=iπ, we have: 𝜋 = ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) 𝑖 π=  i ln(−1) ​    Knowing that  ln ⁡ ( − 1 ) = 𝑖 𝜋 ln(−1)=iπ, we confirm: 𝜋 = 𝑖 𝜋 𝑖 π=  i iπ ​    Simplifying this, we obtain: 𝜋 = 𝜋 π=π

American mathematicians when they found oil in numbers
This orange man is my idol
this is one of the coolest things i have ever seen
Abhinay, pls comment — fast
High-school math
Orange at the end:please forgive me I will not do it again
Dammit these are all cool as hell. Had math been this interesting 20 years ago, I'd  have gotten my PhD much MUCH earlier in life
Bro you are pro
algebra!
⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛
This is genuinely crazy to even see the fact you make it all make since while keeping the math true to its formulas and introducing them within each other is out of this world its the small details I see in this and the minds behind it all has me shocked just simply liking this video isn't enough justice for this in my opinion it might be math at its basic levels just to understand them because obviously it go's deeper into never ending equations unfortunately man is doomed to numbers and the math will show you that to😅
Seriously man ❤
That was absolutely amazing!!!
At 5:34 orange got some skills of drawing a perfect circle
You are a genius sir❤❤❤❤
😂
coolest video ever

Wow... I'm dumb...
11:34 √-0?
Bro took math is fun in a whole new level
I didn't know math could turn into the death star
Eip
make an animation vs. math 2: infinities, like aleph null or something
Once you start pulling out the Greek letters it gets scary

I actually really like the characterization of Euler here! (I think that's what that's called lol dyscalculia go brrrr-)  It seems like they're just evil at first, but once Orange breaks the universe it becomes obvious that they *knew* that was gonna happen and thought that *Orange* knew too. A simple miscommunication where they both thought the *other* was the villain, and made peace when they found out they were wrong.   I also like that Euler seems to speak math as a language, therefore making their previous communication difficulties make more sense. (Shown when Orange tries to explain after his world breaking incident that they need to get home, Euler seeming confused, and then Orange showing them by adding a multiplication symbol to their i symbol, which is how *they* opened the door to what wasn't actually the *real* world, but the *imaginary* one, cuz they're an imaginary equation.)  It ends in what's actually a really heartwarming scene where Euler finally opens the *right* door, and then gets some new math friends! I hope they're having a good time :)
My... My dyscalculia :0 It's GONE!!
So much gonna wreck my math test after that

Math really is the root of all evil
This video is always a masterpiece!👏👍
This Video Is Good For A High School Student 😊.  Thank You Alan ❤...!
The creativity put into this video is incredible how Alan can create such imagination especially with math bro you made it look funner than what it is
yeah, that is pretty much how I felt when learning calculus the first time

Honestly I feel bad for TSC in this video. He’s basically the antagonist here and that’s only because he just wanted to survive.   When *e* ended up being aggressive, TSC went into survival mode. His quick thinking combined with his incredible ability to learn at such insane speeds and his intelligence ended up making him a threat, purely because TSC thought *e* wanted to kill him and subsequently started to retaliate. That retaliation in turn caused *e* to want to truly end TSC, to protect it’s realm.   What a fantastic lil story.   (You should definitely have *e* return one day if you want!!)
TSC learned math in 14 minutes better than I have in 6 years... 😭
The "yaaaaaaa" was very funny 🤣
Why are there so many greej charachters ζ φ π Φ

I learned more math then in 12 jears of school
i sent this video to my mom who is a math teacher
The bow made of two 2, + and =, that shoot 4 is epic 😅
you learn more here than in math class
Never have I actually loved math, also I love the video it helped me on my math wuiz
"Cool"  *looks away andback*  "WHAT THE F-"
So cool
7:42 ahem, *sigma symbol.*
This escalated quickly from kindergarten math to college math.
Did he sleepwalk into your calculator?
This vedio got from math animation to a whole action movie lol😂
i can't wait for another part😍
I done my masters in mathematics. And this video helped me to visualize what I have studied. Love from India🇮🇳😊😊😊
0:58 the part when we all thought that 100 was the last number
Is veri good
これは本当に凄い 数学の先生に見せたら感激するに違いない
Bro my head
9:29 bro reached infinity
Teachers should teach us math like this. This is the first time math actually looks cool. (Animations like this is how they teach it I mean)
When e pulled out the integral to absorb the infinite function blast by taking it to the limit, I LOLed. Awesome work!
Bro taught us math in a fun way.

I hate math be like:Argghh my brain is broken i don't understand everything!!!💀
I didn’t understand like half of this because I went through the second half of school just getting my assignments done not worrying about remembering anything because I knew I would never use half of it after a graduated, but I still loved this little video
OMG NOT א AT THE END 😭😭😭😭
Mathematics has been introduced into an entertainment channel, which seems to be more enjoyable and easier to understand😀
alan should just do this instead of sending his kid to school
I have no idea what I did with math when I first discovered How I use math Right now 1×2 =2 to 4 to 8 to 16  All the way up to 1024 2048
Whats the bgm for this entire thing

I hope someone does a Chinese character version of this!!! Imagine! 発 looks like a bow being "released", 人 of course is a person, 龍 would make an awesome dragon, 上 & 下 could make a great lever. Think of all the monstrous kanji you could use!
Imagine learning all of this math in 14 minutes like why can't I do that
Teacher:there is a math test tomorrow The test:
my math teacher played this video in class
Cool
I WANT A GAME EXACTLY LIKE THIS!!!

No end for maths
this could've been stopped quickly if he just added 1
@alanbecker can you make "Animation vs. Chemistry" video? I think that would be phenomenal with your genious imagination and animation skills. Please, make it :)
The moment the infinity power is handled by Limit Function approaching to Infinity makes my years of pain learning Calculus worth it
That’s SUM animation you got here.
I love this 5/5 stars 🥰😍🤩🤑!

watching this just a few days before i graduate from school finally, and this animation reminds me of my journey through the world of math, even if i wasn't too good at it, its kinda nice to just see how far ive come from good old 1+1=2

Came here for a simple explanation. I dont know what I was thinking.
This has been my favorite channel since I was five and just like this video, it just added up to getting better and better. The series is the reason I want to wake up every morning.
So that geometry circle is basically a Death Star
Can you please make more videos like this like stick man versus reading or science or Music please these videos are the most entertaining. These are the videos that made me want to subscribe to your channel.

I didn’t know you could make such a video with just a stick man and mathematics
nice animation & sounds😍
Do they talk I forgot lol
You are all looking at the finger and not at the moon. Of course, thanks to those who worked on animation, but only someone who is infinite himself could create the science of mathematics, which carries the concept of infinity. He is infinite because he can see beyond all ends. He is the same God. He is a single entity that does not fit into time and space, which controls the universe with the sciences it has created.
that is why math is not my thing

Could anyone please explain to me what happened at the end with the infinite series of gama function? Ehat were thise circles or the meaning as a whole?
I need you as my math and physics teacher 😢

I watch this video instead of studying math

And we still can't get a proper animation of Berserk
I'm trying to understand what's interesting in this movie and I can't. Can someone explain to me? Thank you!

Teachers: *Gives math homework* Internet: *Explains math homework* Alan Becker and crew: *Creates the most mind-bending, jaw-dropping, epic animation from the most basic to the most advanced knowledge about math with an orange stickman fighting then befriending Euler*
Bro learnt Mathematics in 14 mins  and we took more than 14 years to learn the same
The fact that he learns parenthisis for a split-second before SUBTRACTION
nothing short of magical beauty...
this is masterpiece!!!! the sfx is top tier

This music makes me want to sit down and do my math homework
this but as a vr game for a teaching tool

I love it how under 2 minutes this already shows more math than I have every known in my life
bro you just show the beauty of mathematics. I really love this video and physics video was also the most amazing animation video I ever watched.

being bad at math and seeing this vid makes you want to learn it but at the same time this may be too much for others
I love the surprise Euler identity early on when just playing with simple addition and subtraction, because it’s just like when your playing with a simple concept in math and stumble across something bizzare/that you have no clue how to understand yet.
BRO WY GO TO THE SCHOOL WHEN I CAN WATCH THESE
the greatest action movie I've seen lately
I’ve never felt so smart and stupid at the same time

There are also math monsters, using the letters, sigma, and integrals as weapons!

Hey Alan,i know you won’t see this comment knowing this episode was posted 9 months ago,but i wanted to thank you and all your team,recently our dog died and we’re still grieving as to how she died,and your video,as well as the physics one,made us feel better,i can’t understand how but it helped my brother grief easier in a way,so i wanted to thank all the people who helped at the concept of this video,thank you a lot
upload math 2 please.

How about animation vs chemistry and animation vs biology
This video contains more information than 9 grades at school 😂
My math teacher play's this  Us: 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😃😃😆😆
if orange kept the math in future altercations and used th fact that he can multiply his speed and power, he would become a god.
No calculator were harmed during this film.

I never was one to like math, now i adore it
I believe this left the realm of maths💀

0:01 pov: link in the beginning of every zelda game
I love how people dont even know what is the imaginary number and still watch this  Imaginary Number (written as 'i') is equal to the square root of -1 which we considered the second dimension in our Real Number Line, the Real Number line with the Imaginary Number line is known as Cartesian Plane, which is basically a place used to graph equations.  Part 2 - 25 likes: Fun Fact is that |i| is not equal to i, but 1, beacuse if you look at the Cartesian Plane, you see that the distance from 0 to i is 1 unit, so |i|=1, and so |-i| is also equal to 1.  The reason of i being 2root(-1) comes with some other weird facts, such as e^(pi×i)=-1, i^5=i^2, etc...  About the Cartesian Plane being used to graph equations, the x-axis is the Real Number Line which is the number we insert in an equation, and the y-axis being the Imaginary Number Line where it's the result of the equation respect to the number inserted.  You know the Reals and the Imaginaries, but there are also Complexs, writen in form a+b×i where a and b are real numbers, ex: 5+2i, this equation can't be compressed more than it is beacuse of mathematical number relation reasons.  I is the second, j is the third and k is the fourth dimension in graphing equations. (More nerdy stuff at 75 likes)
Nooooooo
how you did it broh ?? which software program
First time i use my brain
Amazing!

Theory: The physics one and this one are one big loop. After the orange stick guy gets teleported at the end, he goes to animation vs physics. Then when he gets to the portal thingy, he shows the other orange guy everything, then goes through. He then ends up the animation vs math, with 0 knowledge of being there before. This happens again and again.
This taught me math better and faster than 12 years of school ever did
What the faq is going in the other half of the vid, I don't get it man. This makes me sad.

It's incredible how a stickman animation made me feel dumb and stupid
The way that it is in black and orange🌚🌚🌚💀💀
POV the evolution of mathematics
7:53 Euler's Identity really released their Domain Expansion
1:02 TSC is just like "Yay!!... What did I accomplish?"
The moral story about this animation is: math is a fun thing to study no matter easy or hard👍🏻
people that had no idea what was happeneding but still like it alot 👇
Can you tell me the name of this song?
Math teacher. How did you study?At that time I
No way
i learned so much in this animation than my actual school
Hi 1:04 😊
The second coming funfact : yes this is amazing I will tell about this my friends
crazy you can turn math into a masterpiece.
e
Why do I feel like the portal thing that the e did is the way that TCO travels when it’s not?
e^i pi can’t escape orange
how can someone make cool animations like this, anyone got any clues
Больше смысла, чем в самой матиметике
Puta q pariu, esse é o vídeo + incrível 1 eu já vi!
Can you please do Animation vs Science next? 😊
I need more videos like this ❤
I didn't understand most of that but... neat!

TSC knows more math than I do
He kinda look like a cyborg 3:43
U guys ain't talking about the giant in the end
Oh my God. A math person can't skip 1 second. Wow....

Это можно смотреть бесконечно
1+1=2 3+3=6 8+8=16
My worst nightmare can fight back
There are so many clever references to laws, rules, principles. I had to advanced frame by frame scene by scene many times to catch it all. And I still feel like I must've missed things.
Orange learned more math in 14 minutes than me in 7 years of school
Оранжевый и его шизофрения:
Part ♎️
This was basically what went on in my brain whenever i had to do math in my head in class 🤣🤣
I dont understand the math, but the animation is seriously amazing

The sounds you used in the begging sound like me navigating in the shop in dead space or me switching my gun in dead space
Plot twist. It was three blue one brown the whole time
can you make part 2 please I really want to see division, multiplication and any other math thing
Peoples brains that are overfilled with math and confused    👇
You can turn i over to make !(factorial)

This symbol is for zoophiles 13:33 (right)
OMG! I leave you alone for a few months and now I've got all this new content to watch. ^_^
13:46 their mech is a giant alif nol, the smallest infinity
THIS IS A SINAMATIC MASTERPIECE
Only Alan Becker could make math epic
Wee need a second episode
Like this ,maths attack on me ...!!
This is a masterpiece. Bravo!
The teacher showed me this video in my school class, and the children responded well. They said it was fun and interesting.
This little orange needs to explore chemistry, just as it did with mathematics. Let's call the video: Animation vs Chemistry That would be legendar
dude must be related to Benoit Mandelbrot!
nice animation
i completel understood the physics one, but maths... so fast i can't even read
WHAT THE HECK how orange know everything
4:42 the power of Christ compels you!
I am a scientist

i love how orange made a gun using math
Ecellent
I think Alan is making a new AvA series because he hasn't released new shorts and episodes for a long time
This is BRILLIANT. I don't think I've laughed harder at a maths video in a long time. Probably ever.
So, lovely👍👍👍👍
ini matimatik kahh ooo0 tambahan iji😮
Your animation is a Masterpiece ❤🤩
4:42 Tsc litrally fought e iπ with christianity💀💀💀
Me encantan tus animaciones, sigue asi, eres el mejor.
The moral of the story is: pi is powerful
If I see an integral in this video I will scream those things are scary
6:45 Did my first algebra lesson on this and knew I saw the sin graph somewhere before lol
he even broke the brains of math teachers
what the

If math class was like this I would actually have fun an pay attention
Cuándo van a sacar el videojuego de eso

Atleast I learned some math today
считаю на разных видео 15
4:09 when the equations in my paper are alive
Animation vs. Music would be fantastic
Well i stopped math classes after i got my nuclear engineering degree and was lost for like half the video. Thanks for making me go look stuff up
❤❤
e: greatest villain of all time
Now I love math
I thank the Universe for half (0.5) Playback speed
6:22
These videos hit harder than most movies 🔥🔥🔥
Perfect, perfect absolutely perfect Brilliantly creative and boy was it fantastic,a fun creatively made math adventure
TSC learned more math in 14 minutes than I ever learned in 12 years
This Video Is Really Amazing, I'm A Maths Lover🤩 & I Never Seen Such An Amazing Mathematical Animated Fighting Scene With Perfect Mathematical Logics😲❤
I working my brain is to hard😮
a
Tco killing e with e(cos+isin) 💀
what a boss fight :D
POV: what we see as math homework
Being Math teacher like your content very much
My favorite part is when orange made an orbital death laser to kill a math equation
What about this ≠
Did I am wrong or wrong I guess 0:15 job was diagnosed in my mind

Me quede sin, palabras, 😮 si asi eseñaran en la aulas creo que hubiera aprendido algo mas.
Bro learns faster than Isaac newton under a tree
Animation vs. Programing plsssssssssssssssssss
Did you know? in 13:45, the big N seen at the left of the screen is the smallest amount of infinity. You can find out more by VSauce.
Cool😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🤩
The + end
is there going too be Part 2..? 🙂
Me being grade 4 but already studying calculus
I watch it this movie when it was 2023 but now its 2024 but i still want watch this movie
ENEYMORE IS WRONG!!!!  1+1=2 NOT 11!!!!!
w vid
guys can we get a pin
this def my fav vid of all time
this is my fav vid
This video is so fire I can't even say how much
Imagine the potential of Animation vs Programming
happy birthday
It’s worth it to watch during Pi Day. lol
1+1=2 3+3=6
2:48 NEVER divide ANY number by zero.
Who knew maths could be fun Senku from Dr. Stone would be proud
Teacher: alright whats the answer to this Kids: 41 Orange: *violence*
Daddayumm this is epic
The sound effects are on another level
The sound effects are on another level
we want animation vs biology too T_T
Awesome
12:11 is very relatable😂 Overall it's mind-blowing🤯 Just love the way how you highlight the different concepts of math just in 14min which i learned in 16years😅 It's amazing! I can't get bored watching this over and over again!👏
Your animation is so well made and nice, I showed it to my math teacher and he basically used it to make his lesson. Wish there will be more of Animation vs Math !
2:16 2 negatives make a positive
本当に式の変形をここまでわかりやすくするのはすごいな
this video is one of the main tools I'm going to use to teach my future kids math!
Me in math class
When I first clicked on the video it said  it was 822 hours long
10:01 e scream 😊
Make a SERIES
7:37 that damage you can take if hits you
Bro was traumatised after seeing the complex numbers 😂😂
iπ e
Coming back to this video for like the fifth time and just noticed ANOTHER awesome detail: when Orange pulls out a copy of a number, the "stretch" effect is an equals sign - 1=1, the reflexive property!
This is pure gold
legal
4:22 lil mistake ? e^iπ-π=-e^-π=-0.04321...  Anyway, it's SO GOOOD !! PLZ MORE
wait till he starts with calculus
.
wath is the next vidéo ?
Dude that guy are ainchtain
Nice videos are not long But it is long and nice😊
I was not prepared for that battle cry. 😅
Hmm, is this Universe 11B?
this is cool and all but can somebody help with my ela work as they strolled straight and soundly down the land, sally and sam saw schools and saws, what is the figuarive language?
Alguien: porqué te gusta tanto la matematica? Yo: conoces a Alan Becker?  Esto es simplemente arte, me dejó sin palabras... O al menos sin palabras en inglés, perdón por estar hablando en español pero quería hacerle saber al artista que hizo esta magnifica animación que lo apoyamos desde todo el mundo, saludos desde Venezuela 🇻🇪 cuando era pequeña mi sueño siempre fue ser como Alan Becker, hoy se que eso es imposible pero aún así quisiera tener tanto talento como él, we 💜 u Alan Becker
wonderful
This is soo cool
I always new the letter e was the real villain of maths
Ai meu Deus, to ferrado, se eu ver esses números todo eu desmaio
It's going
LEGENDARY
Dude if math was like this i would enjoy❤

It's itself a masterpiece ❤❤❤
10:02 WAAAAAAAH!
Ep 2 pls
😮I love these videos.  🎉
Love the sounds
old McDonald had a farm ei , eiπ
Süpersiniz, tebrikler.
its no surprise to me that you have 25 million subs  this is CONTENT, i love your work.
8:23 to 8:30 is what it feels like to verify trig identities lol.
The amount of imagination put into this video is beyond real!
I love this animation.
Noooo my brain
hello....? i'm just..... (hello! my name is jihoo kim! i'm korean! alan becker love!)

8:25 That surprised me a bit
2:50 Good take on DIV/0 I like that
50:00
500:00
Tried to search if someone commented about that already, but since Firefox/Youtube comments search doesn't seem to work for some reason, I'll just post:  4:15 is an error, -e**(iπ) expands to -(cos(π) + i sin(π)) which is - cos(π) - i sin(π).
THE MORE MATH I LEARN THE MORE I UNDERSTAND
can you make an animation vs algebra
Damn, math
How did you do an entire video on maths and not (really) talk about decimals ( I mean like 1 + 0.38)
make it a video game and change the world forever
10:00 is funny
They should’ve taught math like this  Going to a different dimension 😈
3:45 Don't worry your brain🗿
Wouah 😃
07:35 It's good to see these cool videos and lots of love, how cool
Quite cool, see you, stickman and well, something else and it's really cool to see these cool videos
13:25 the saddest moment i ever seen in alan becker animations😢😢
STFU this is fire
Sooo good
1+1=2
I’m sorry but the noise at 11:19 just 😂😂😂😂

insanely great
i feel like animator vs animation 6 should include The Second Coming using the power of math to fight the dark lord or something
I love how it's taken mankind thousands of years and many great mathematicians to get this far and tsc simply figures it all out like a game is a matter of minutes. I wonder his iq.
T
You should turn this into a minecraft mod
Wow. Problems as power…. THATS powerful
BRILLIANT JUST BRILLIANT👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Bro deserves an Oscar.
First of all universe has no number system. all number like 0 to 9 and other with combinations are created by human to calculate and for their profit to understand the universe in a specific box. But kinds of physics law and mathematics rules are not same in the space and universe law. still we are understanding the fact of universe and finding the concept of the universe existence. Human will define it by their own rules. but the real fact is that universal rules always remain differ to the human defined rules. Good Luck Humans.

Fascinating to watch
Great for kids stuck at home without child minders

I wish there was a similar video like this but about music theory. 🎵 🎶
10:01 my favourite 😂
This was cool and all, but this made me hate math even more
its done. I done my graduation through this video learning imp things now we are chilling suck other maths
This video got past my school blocking system because it had math 😆
5×5=25
Learning math
Badass......no other words
Ждём анимация против химии
This is actually quit good for children ngl
Now that’s a boss battle if I’ve ever seen
Insane video... Describes what maths is doing under the hood....   DESTRUCTION!!!
10:45 orange you've been here for 11 minutes and you've already made a all destroying death laser out of math how
Math is badass
13:30 Is it the symbol of the Zoopiles flag?!?! 💀☠️
10:00 was most epic scene
Какой раз я уже это пересматриваю..шедевр!
Smart kid and Grade 12 Math Teacher when hey compete who is the true math genius:
Це круто. Дуже цікаво та весело. Дякую)))
After watching this, now i just want to learn everything and everything about math...this is just mind-blowing ❤
To my calculations, I have no clue what I’m Seeing
Bro animation vs chemistry 🧪 please ❤
So papiyr 1+1!

Subtitles being explanations to the math would be helpful to my understanding of this math.
This was briliant 🫶🏼🥹
Allen some made math cool
This is where you meet the many bright mathematicians in the world

Eu n entendendo nada e de pau duro Cinema!
Just back about anything 😊
Why are so many mathematical terms based off of greek letters?
13:34 that thing on the right   *it scares me*
E is for evil
orange got the iq lol
👍👍👍
So nice... I can't admire you because the words of English language is not enough for it ❤
great !👋👋👌👌
This really helped me with my math homework! Thanks Orange!
I need an explanation video for this.
=f(•)
i is iota i= root -1
I only learned into the cricle one
THE PLUS END EQUALS WHAT
How does pi have cos wave and sin wave😊
Does it have algebra (I know one x+y(cos)(sin9)
That Sigma robot was looking like Igris from Solo Leveling 😉
ME EXPLICA ISSO POR FAVOR
mano tu É MUITO BRABO
1 + 1 = 3?, 1 (hu) man + 1 wo(hu)man maybe 3 ppl in family (maybe more or only 2?), depend on reality in the future.
Mesmo sem falar uma palavra todos os idiomas entendem. 🇧🇷🇧🇷
this would be fun if it was a video game and a live virtual simulation to play and you can be the stick character and do real algebra and do whatever and even do work related things and business all while having fun af
this is entertaining af
How I can actually learn math:
Zero gived by indian
Can you pls tell me which apps you used to create such animation please
SIr Amazing work 👌
Waaawaa where is oranges friends😢😢😭😭😨😨😖😖😫😫
This was more cinematic than any marvel movie released in 2023
My Brain !!! ( I Only Know Addition (+) Subtraction (-) Multiplying (×) And Division (÷)
is this philomath?
This team deserves the Turing Award!
desde el minuto 1.44 ya no entendi
why is it that e^i*pi is genuinely adorable lmaooo
disliking math because its to hard to teach👎 making cool animations to teach it👍
👍
Please make  animation vs chemistry
those who saw aleph    👇
1+1=1 because  water +water =water
1+1=2
god😍
Tyrion Lannister in another universe I DEMAND A TRIAL BY MATH ORANGE SHALL BE MY CHAMPION xdd
I love it so much!!

Mr Alan Becker, It is men like you that used to be superiors in a different time, such creativity, talent and a great mind should never go unseen.
I see aleph null at the end there
I hated maths so much but after watching this video, man I am in love with maths
where is parabola
Hgvc ubcvghcvhuvgfyuvgyvgthuigghiughuig
2:54 now I can finally understand why we cannot divide by 0
This was awesome, it felt like It as watching some kind of math boss fight or anime
I LOVE YOUR ALL OF YOUR  VIDEOS
Fantastic. The part I really liked was the multiple unskippable adverts that completely broke the immersive spell of the video and gave me a chance to think about financial services, feminine hygiene products, and Amazon Prime.
09:58 I love seeing my logo so powerful!
OMG THIS IS INSANE!!!!
bro the math and physics was amazing ! you should make chemistry too it will be mightiest.great job bro well done*
orange vs math
This tickled my brain to learn more math
Being an engineer and a math enthusiast I love this❤
Masterpiece
9:29 bro used hollow purple
Bro has been teaching me more than my school
Eu sem entender porra nenhuma: 😎
After watching this my brain asked me where to save it.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
1:40 At the start  4:01 At the middle 7:18 At the end
It’s giving infinite craft
Like it
Like space movie ❤❤
Just incredible!
I am actually speechless. This was way more mind blowing than i expected it to be.
Orange just learned every math equation and expression ever.
Yea, ya lost me aftr 2+2
4:09 hey, ya dropped this!
Understood nothing bot the sound effect was good,👏
This was incredible. Such an amazing visual of math that makes it understandable. And a better story plot than most Hollywood movies nowadays. Lol
… no amount of words can express my joy from seeing thing. This is merely a husk of how I feel

Animation vs Chemistry???
Me knowing I would be dead once euler pulled out the logarithm: 😭😭😭😭😭😭  I STILL HAVE ALL MY MATH EXAMS TO DOOO
Weeeeeeeeeeeee 11:16
Make an explaination about this video is a good idea
why dont he multiply himself
1+1=2
If we had some kids inside a sphere, couches divinity. Total number 22 errors, inside and outside this world of levitating parents. Thanx.

Amazing cartoon! Has anyone found any factorials in the video?)
You should do a science one. My son loves this video btw ❤
Wow so nice
Somehow i like math rn
syntax error
Could you do something similar with chemistry?

Ваууу какаая работа❤
Mind blowing bro maths is geneous
Football scores and results today so far but.❤
Lol... Qwerty.

Can i have the soundtracks used??
I hate math
Death star at the end
I don't know why this e^iπ was in war with him the whole video? 🤔
1 +.1  _  2
То чувство когда 14 минутный мультик про стикмена  научил тебя матиматике лучше чем школа за 11 лет
Wooow. Thank you. You just tickled my soul.
This was brilliant. I think some short stories for individual mathematical concepts would be highly educational. I thought the battle was a bit prolonged without much new discernable math was presented, but I take this video to depict the authors struggle with natural logarithms and the concept of "e". Everything was clear and intuitive to that point.

Math: final boss

Is there going to be a prt two?
Goodness gracious
bro was able to learn the most complicated math problems in the world in only 14 mins tf 😲
Please make an animation vs calculus !!
I love your videos 😊
I’ve never been so happy to see math
1:40 warringed e^iπ 11:07 white moded
I would love a part 2 or something
My man broke math with math..
I like this video and it's animation, it's so pretty.
GÖH FÖHNF

Mathematics smells genocide in any era. This is why the Ego always stuck periodically.
Wow, I didn't know math could be this..... Cool! Mr. Shreeve wishes you a happy new year.  edit: typos

Me using a calculator in 2nd grade be like
SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE THIS A GAME
squared -1 is not possible - my calculator says "MATH Error".
What is even e iπ
It’s just TSC and pemdas
This e iπ is so cute) and I like the detail of the sounds of everything happening around
😮
Amazing 🤩
Remember bois it all started from 1
Haven’t watched all of the video yet but I hope they hit orange with the 6x+10=40
классс
The only time math entertained me😂
What about Animation vs. Chemistry?
1+1=2
Try animation vs p
When I watch it, it gives me a relief.  I really like it❤
Please make animation vs programming next You can explore a whole new world of science math and logic and incorporate them in animation. I know you'll make a masterpiece out of it. Please consider it.
Do animation vs biology

Wow
TSC learned math better than school could in 13 years
At the begging , I felt like I just saw algebra Proof? 1=1
Guys I wasn’t this smart until the vid came out and I’m the smartest in my school, I’ll prove it! He got the idea from thing called a school

Is the puma
Teachers should put this in their classes 😮
This is the most epic and interesting film I have ever seen! (Even though I didn't understand much😅)
1+1=2
Just looking at this makes me feel soooo smart 🤓 and sorry about my account looking like coal and my account is supposed to be called spit Fiyeri
I don't know why but this type of animated person really make me sad....... weird right!? Although liked the video.. really informative
10:03 Waaaaeee
10:02 cute
This is sooo cute!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I like to come back to this video every once in a while when ive learned more math and understood more parts of the video. Currently just understood the unit circle, radians, and sigma notation!
Just he should make a part two
I feel like an alien watching a video from humans
3blue1brown collab with your channel, and the world won't need more math school class. You would have solved the math educqtion problem
Ummm i think I'm only clueless person here just enjoying fight of numerics 🫡
I have 50 million competitors in mathematics, I'm leaving!
I showed this to my precalc teacher and he loved it
1+1=2
your work is amazing i wish i could animate like you do
animation vs chemistry or astronomy
washingmachine
Euler Number/identity ❤
You should turn this into a game, and the way to get more powerful is to incorporate more complex equations, and make them stronger
A really trippy part (7:01)
10:14 pause and find the black dot. Alan somehow made an optical illusion on accident
9:46 Here’s time stamp for Epik Mech bot looking thingy
you taught me math in the most interesting way, since its learning i already forgot about it
And you just ruin 2022
And you just ruin 2020
And i hate 2023 because that year was disappointhing and it suck ok?
And i will not pay you
And this is for charlie hebdo je suis charlie i am charlie

Stickman was just curious about the Euler's Identity, but it alert itself, so stickman tried to find out where 'e', 'i', and 'pi' comes from, and that's why he was surprised when he found 'i'
1+1=2

Waiting for Animation vs Chemistry
歐拉公式（Euler's formula）是數學中一個著名的公式，尤其在複分析領域中具有重要地位。這個公式表達了複指數函數與三角函數之間的深刻關係，公式如下：  \[ e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x) \]  其中，\( e \) 是自然對數的底數（約等於 2.71828...），\( i \) 是虛數單位，而 \( \cos \) 和 \( \sin \) 分別代表餘弦和正弦函數。  當 \( x = \pi \) 時，歐拉公式可以簡化為歐拉等式（Euler's identity）：  \[ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \]  這個等式被稱為「數學中最美麗的公式」，因為它簡潔地聯繫了五個基本數學常數：\( e \)，\( i \)，\( \pi \)，1 和 0。  要將歐拉公式與神秘學結合，我們可以從象徵和隱喻的角度出發。在神秘學中，數字和幾何形狀往往被賦予特定的象徵意義。例如，圓形可能象徵永恆和完整性，而數字如 1 可以代表統一性和宇宙的根本本質。  這樣一來，歐拉等式中的 \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \) 可以從象徵學上解釋如下：  - \( e \)（自然成長或進化的基底）代表生命力量或自然界不斷增長的本質。 - \( i \)（虛數單位）可以代表超越物質世界的精神或想象層面。 - \( \pi \)（圓周率）象徵完整性、永恆和宇宙的秩序。 - 1 代表統一性、創造的開始和宇宙的本質。 - 0 代表虛無、潛能和無限的可能性。  將這些元素結合，歐拉等式可以被視為象徵宇宙的創造和存在的本質，其中自然的進化（\( e \)）與精神世界（\( i \)）相結合，透過完整性（\( \pi \)）產生了統一性（1），最終返回到虛無或無限潛能（0）。  這只是一種將數學與神秘學相結合的隱喻性詮釋，並非基於科學或數學證據。在討論這類主題時，要保持開放但批判性的思考態度，了解這些想法多半屬於個人的信仰或哲學領域，而非嚴格的科學知識。

Something like Animation vs. Music would be good. Various notes and ornaments fighting for their lives. TSC would probably go deaf with that fortississimo.
You make learning more fun!😊.thanks

I’m not good at math but I feel this taught me more than school ever did.
As I am grade 9th Students can anyone tell or tech me that what just happened after 3:51 . That will be very helpful for me . wait for someone's reply. thankyou
This is beyond extraordinary!
*My brain* 🧠: 💀💀💀

I’m 11 years out of college algebra, and I’m currently taking trig and having a lot of trouble. This video is flashing so much information that I’ve forgotten into my brain right now. Thank yoi
I lornd from this video more then school that my. And I'm being series.😂
Weapons of math instruction. I am 99.999% certain I am the first person to make this joke in the comments of this video.

Bro thx for this video
When tsc left i noticed that it looked like he was teleported to The animation vs physics it might be a theory that the portal lead him to the physics dimension or space What'd u guys think?
make logic next
I didn't understand anything but I think that the animation is cool :D
In 15 minutes, a stick figure was able to defeat math, while us weakling humans could take a lifetime to even come close to that.
This is an absolutely beautiful way to visualize and show math, I WISH we had people that could make this stuff when I was in school.
I learned more here than at school
جيد ماشاء الله
Toán hoạt hình...
very awesome, i understood barely anything... but that's beside the point. The video was awesome though i was wondering if you were gonna do decimals, but nonetheless it's an incredible video
Riemann Hypothesis
What song is used in the video?
2+2=5 xd
i knew that trigonometry would win
If you can come up with an animated video of everything from basic electrical physics to integrated circuits and even ai, winning a prize is very meaningful. I love you very much and hope you can explain the circuit problem that I have been puzzled by
Its beyond our imagination
I always thought mathematics is boring subject  This video prove me wrong  But teachers didn’t tell us the right way to learn  Just cram it was really sad
This beats the crap out of Donald Duck in Mathemagic Land
This is so great!
Mathematics is super difficult to learn

I shall now use my ultimate : the math BFG
This is somehow still educational
This reminds me of playing little alchemy for the first time, anyone feel the same?

no word just WOW!
i loved that XD

Amazing! The details and animation in this is so- Impressive! Awesome!!
I think it would've been really cool if the giant integral staff were used to actually integrate a function.   Picture this: we have the graph of some function—say, f(x) = 1 - cos(x). (Why is this graph here? I dunno. Maybe TSC created it out of a love of hills.) The e^(iπ) creature positions the integral staff at x = 0 and sweeps the staff toward the right. As they do this, the area under the curve lights up, and this charges up the energy of the staff. This is shown by the staff "filling up" with juice from the bottom up. The top of the juice could even trace out a curve, graphing the amount of juice accumulated up to that point, thus graphing an antiderivative of f by the fundamental theorem of calculus. Then, when the integral staff is full, the e^(iπ) creature can use its stored-up energy to fire a giant laser at TSC.
What's that background music? Need to have it
Your creativity blows my mind

Even though I'm a massive math nerd, I still didn't understand *anything* about the gunction (gun function) TSC used to cancel out the Euler's identities, nor do I know how infinity with sin and cos managed to turn it into a bloody railgun. And then with all the symbols towards the end, too. I had no idea what those meant.  It just goes to show that despite how much you think you know, there's always someone who knows more than you.   (In my defense, I only just barely graduated High School)
Still dont know cuz im not a guy like Pytagoras type

One of my classmate told my teacher to watch this video and my teacher was really into it, he state out the math was used in the video. Purely amazing!

I realize i don't understand math enough to learn anything from this animation, but i have just an inkling enough to know its teaching something.... ugh
I was watching the physics one yesterday and fell asleep to it
I ❤ Math

I LOVE MATH!! I LOVE MATH!!!
Math has fractions😊
Hahahahaha!!!! This is INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
4:42 bro is holding the cross
could any one teach me all concept of math that i will able to watch and understand this video
Oscar award.........😳
I think math is interesting, but difficult.
It was looking kind of like Dr. Strange on action, and I liked this animation very much. Hats off to the animator
This is the most incredible video I've ever seen.
I am now convinced this is how is how cyberwarfare works. Just two math geniuses duking it out from opposite sides of the planet.
uh i didnt know letters could communicate with us and RUN?
this masterwork right here would make a perfect game to just mess around with math
Imagine this being an actual video game

when I'm not understant question                          nobody < my teacher's performance ))
This math is out of my understanding
I could not really skip the video you deserve the 26.1 M subscribers a great effort if you had completed this animation.
Made by how firey was made
so how did he get there anyways?
What theeeeeeeeeee.......................
non-stop action 👏
Orange beats goku

I am actually extremely surprised to see this video. The way it started and the use of sound and cinematography is brilliant. You made my day and you made me think how much we can show through our animation skills. You gave me a new path to create content from my 3d animation skills. Truly this is beyond imagination! Just loved this! Keep up the great work.

Yyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuu
Thanks, now I know math for 7 grades ahead
This and the physics video taught me more than school
My God,your iq level is infinity🔥

As a commerce student, I can't even comprehend it's greatness but i like it🔥  Going to watch the physics one, i know i can't understand it, but let's go yeah🔥🔥
Am i the only in who thinks that it is hilarious just watching e^ipi look up at the death star tsc created and going "uhhhhh. . . yeah, let's be friends" 😂😂😂
WOW
Как музыка называется?

Poor Orange, he is alone in strage void...

bro literally made a death star out of just simple 1st grade mathematics. LOL. But it was really interesting
The limitations...
This video is both entertaining and educational at the same time!

Knowing the internet, if someone doesn't make an entire math dissertation about this within the next 5 years I'll be very surprised and disappointed.
An animator made me cry over a stickman saying goodbye bye to an equation. 😢
Absolutely mind-blowing
i chuckled at -1 = e ^ i*pi
Quanto é 1+1
Sínico
Hình ảnh trực quan khá tốt.
7:53 did e just do a domain extension ?
Congratulations !! Parabéns!!
You should make animation vs math vs physics.
Incredible ❤
Make more like this buy just for kids
Genial!!! Parabéns!!!
When orange turned out to be a freak...
Very nice ❤❤❤
Holly crap. A mathematician with a very creative imagination. Very entertaining.
Incredible 👏👏👏
My brain is not braining :(
Wtf that's so that's so amazing 💥🕳️
Wow
brilliant!
Me in Desmos during the test
Tbh we need MORE of this. like.. more different type of weapons and other things such as the other color stick figures too
I know everything up to about 4:08
What about chemistry????????
This is actually advanced
8:30 This part was hilarious🤣
Don’t let powerscalers watch this video or else they’ll say “THE ORANGE STICKMAN IS OUTERVERSAL AND HAS INFINITE SPEED”
Man stuck in void forced to do math
the end was so cool
WoW ❤❤
i now know math thank u😀
Good old Euler
my 8yo came talking to me about "i and circle and i dropping its dot" ...
At the near of the end where e powered by pi and i thingie loses and tries to go alternative universe stickman puts cos and i sin to create pi but at middle of rhe animation he seperates pi to cos and sin not i sin there is a problem
Is that an א in the end?
This video went from a class 2 to Oxford level😂
I don´t understand many things here bc it is so complicated but, it´s fun to watch, very good animation
왜 재밌지
So this how e^iπ was proved to be equal to -1 😆
This is the most brilliant math motivational video I have ever seen...
what is eiPi
Why does orange have a fing air strike
واضح ان العمل جدًا متعب شكرًا لك ❤
Me ho only enjoy the fight
one smart yt
De moivre , father of  e^iΠ
Brilliant! Absolutely beautiful! Nice to see that, after all the fighting, they make peace at the end.
this is the most interesting thing i have watched in my entire life
How about music next?
Una manera diferente de aprender creo que acabo de ver el futuro de la  nueva generación de enseñanza.❤ Bravo!!!
Why is the soundtrack so similar to the soundtrack from the game "Oxygen not included"?
2:49 A remarkably concise depiction of _why_ you can't divide a nonzero number by zero.
It's so good that if I watch it 20 times, I can watch it 20 more times and I WON'T get bored. ❤️🔢♾️📘
The Massive Aleph at the end is such a beautiful representation of the gentle giant that is infinity.
What is on 5:40
Well, i can say that's a first. Brought to tears by math.
Wow Bravo 👏
Amazing❤
AMAZING!
Could we get one on computer code?
noice^2
재밌당
What did the symbol Г in the equation mean? 13:04
what the math
This was brilliant. I think some short stories for individual mathematical concepts would be highly educational. I thought the battle was a bit prolonged without much new discernable math was presented, but I take this video to depict the authors struggle with natural logarithms and the concept of "e". Everything was clear and intuitive to that point.
This was a war on complex numbers to go back ro real numbers
How long did it take you to produce this video
Наган калай басы жеткен😮
mais de PK Alan Becker aornla é Caerwvaca
People who know math are enjoying this better than us
can someone explain dot in 8:32
Animation vs coding/programming/whatever you wanna call it. Just make them fight by using code lines and blocks and so' Please! 🙏
if Aleph was large
Alan Baker Max shislo absolute infinite
Aleth Nole at the end was dope
When your bored in math class. Your mind:
If only someone could define i ... 🤔😵
This is giving me nostalgia about my love of physics and math in high school ❤ thank you
GENIUS
Oh man, this gave me some serious flashbacks to frantically studying to pass finals
Where part 2?
6:37 bro had infinite precision to get pi from tuning a dial 😂
i never understood how does √ work and i still dont understand it lol
The big letter at the end what is it
Other people: I don't get how you mess around with wolfram alpha all day and not get bored What I do on wolfram:
Man I can't keep track of it. I felt stupid so long ago, nice to recall this feeling. Great video.
As a math fan and physics lover.. This was more dramatic and epic than LOTR..  Sorry I never saw this until now.

alan i love how u made the film rewatchable i watch 5 times now🙂
Awesome bro i love it 👍
The creativity of this man... I'm speechless.
My math teacher put this video on before because it was about math
Imagine animator + math teacher = math proffesional
My six years old Austic child loves to watch this video always and reviews those mathematics formulas himself on his note. I have no idea about Math but thank you for making this creative video.
school ❌ alan ✅
Cooler vídeo i Like
Why is no one talking about how TSC drew a perfect circle in 5:35
this makes me cry. near the end of the video, the e^i*Pi guy used analytic continuation to help the animator transcend.
Eeeeeeee
superb
Animation vs biology please
One of the most epic things I`ve seen this year. Knowing most of things shown helps a lot to boost epicness)
Death rains from above
Art + Math , I am speechless wow just wow
If you turn this into a video game, you will change the world of teaching.

this is a really complicated videos but when u see it from a way that it just animated u would understand it good
never seen something so beautiful
theres even more math even more math than i can count
Why is there an aleph at the end? 13:37
10:01 😂😂😂
omg it's so cool especially i like math very much
I've never been so focused on math before.
If you made this into a game, I would play it
Blud explained math in 14.02 minutes
Amazing!
The author's science grades are quite good.
That is so amazing a literally cried
My math isn't nearly good enough to understand all the references.  But damn, what a master piece of work!
i*i*i=ie^iπ
-1 =e^iπ
euler's formula
Only people knows math would understand how brilliant this is. Everytime you watch it, you will find something new, like how he uses minus sign to reverse the direction
i like the aleph in the end
I don’t no that math

В принципе мы это за один урок перед пробником Единого Государственного Экзамена повторяем. Только вместо числа эйлера в мнимой степени единицы нашим оппонентом является преподаватель индидуального проекта, который в нас не верит😂  In principle, we repeat this in one lesson before the sample of the Unified State Exam. Only instead of the Euler number to the imaginary degree of one, our opponents are the teacher of the individual project, who does not believe in us)
El mejor momento 10:00
This definitely takes place while TSC is knocked out on the cliff wounded, he masters the fundamentals of the universe and unlocks his power.
We need a video that mention each theory in this video 😎
2:38 I didn't get this one  who could explain 👀
This truly is like all of math! I haven’t gone very far in my studies yet, but I just finished my intro linear algebra class after Calc 2 and I immediately understood that little flash of ‘span!’ It’s like a crossover event between every kind of math. So f-ing awesome!
Masterpiece
Oh my god!!This is so cute❤❤❤❤❤❤

@alanbecker… you are from different universe ❤👍
fell short of words ...love it 🥳
dude i didnt even know half of this existed, i learned more from this than all my years in school
8:27 there is a mistake e^(-iπ) = cos π - i sin π But in video its e^(-iπ) = cos π + i sin π  Or else the video is phenomenon
Very interesting
This is everything I love. Thank you for creating this masterpiece.

Mathematics is a vast and diverse field, covering a wide range of topics from elementary school to advanced university-level studies. It is generally divided into various branches, each with its own set of concepts and principles. Here's a simplified overview:  ### Elementary School Math: 1. **Arithmetic:** Basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 2. **Geometry:** Shapes, sizes, and properties of space. 3. **Fractions and Decimals:** Understanding and manipulating fractions and decimals.  ### Middle School Math: 1. **Pre-Algebra:** Introduction to variables, equations, and basic algebraic concepts. 2. **Algebra:** Solving equations, inequalities, and working with variables. 3. **Geometry:** More advanced concepts involving angles, circles, and three-dimensional shapes. 4. **Statistics and Probability:** Basic concepts of data analysis and probability.  ### High School Math: 1. **Algebra II:** More advanced algebraic concepts, including polynomial functions. 2. **Geometry:** Advanced geometry concepts, including trigonometry. 3. **Pre-Calculus:** Introduction to concepts like limits, functions, and complex numbers. 4. **Calculus:** Differential and integral calculus, studying rates of change and accumulation.  ### University-Level Math: 1. **Calculus:** Advanced topics like multivariable calculus and vector calculus. 2. **Linear Algebra:** Study of vector spaces and linear mappings. 3. **Number Theory:** Properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. 4. **Abstract Algebra:** Algebraic structures like groups, rings, and fields. 5. **Real Analysis:** Rigorous study of real-valued sequences and functions. 6. **Complex Analysis:** Study of complex numbers and functions. 7. **Topology:** Properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations.  ### Specialized Areas: 1. **Differential Equations:** Study of equations involving derivatives. 2. **Probability and Statistics:** Advanced statistical methods and probability distributions. 3. **Combinatorics:** Counting and arranging objects in a systematic way. 4. **Graph Theory:** Study of graphs and networks.  Mathematics is a dynamic field, with ongoing research and new discoveries. Different grades and education levels cover varying aspects of these topics. The key is to build a solid foundation in elementary concepts and gradually explore more advanced areas based on interest and academic progression. **Title: A Journey Through the Evolution of Mathematics Education**  **Introduction:** Mathematics has been an integral part of human civilization, evolving and adapting across various educational stages. From the foundational concepts introduced in preschool and kindergarten to the complex theories explored in college, the history of mathematics education is a testament to human curiosity, intellect, and the pursuit of knowledge.  **Preschool and Kindergarten:** In the early stages of education, mathematics begins with simple yet crucial concepts. Preschool and kindergarten lay the groundwork for mathematical thinking through activities that involve counting, recognizing shapes, and understanding basic patterns. Children engage in playful learning experiences that form the building blocks of numerical awareness.  **Elementary School:** Elementary school introduces students to the fundamental principles of arithmetic, geometry, and basic algebra. From addition and subtraction to multiplication tables and division, students gain fluency in essential operations. Geometry lessons delve into the properties of shapes, and mathematical problem-solving becomes a central focus. The goal is to develop a solid mathematical foundation that students can build upon in subsequent educational stages.  **Middle School:** The middle school years mark the transition to more abstract mathematical thinking. Pre-algebra and algebra courses introduce students to variables, equations, and inequalities. Geometry studies expand to include trigonometry, and statistics and probability become part of the curriculum. Middle school mathematics bridges the gap between concrete concepts and the more theoretical aspects of high school mathematics.  **High School:** High school mathematics takes students on a journey through advanced algebra, calculus, and more specialized branches such as number theory and discrete mathematics. Trigonometry deepens, and pre-calculus prepares students for the study of limits and derivatives in calculus. Courses in statistics and probability provide a practical understanding of data analysis. High school mathematics is designed to cultivate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, preparing students for further academic pursuits.  **University-Level Math:** College-level mathematics offers a rich and diverse landscape. Calculus is explored in depth, and students delve into abstract algebra, linear algebra, real analysis, and complex analysis. Specialized areas like differential equations, topology, and number theory become focal points for those pursuing advanced studies in mathematics. The emphasis shifts towards theoretical understanding and mathematical proof, fostering a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of the subject. **Title: Navigating the High School Odyssey: Academics, Growth, and Beyond**  **Introduction:** High school is a transformative chapter in the journey of every student, characterized by academic challenges, personal growth, and the forging of lifelong connections. It serves as a crucial bridge between the formative years of childhood and the impending responsibilities of adulthood.  **Academic Exploration:** The high school curriculum is a mosaic of subjects designed to broaden students' horizons. Core disciplines such as mathematics, science, literature, and social studies provide a well-rounded education.

Clubs, sports teams, and artistic endeavors provide students with avenues for self-expression, leadership development, and teamwork. These activities contribute to a vibrant school culture, shaping students into well-rounded individuals with a multitude of skills and experiences.  **Social Dynamics:** High school is a social crucible where friendships are forged, and personal identities solidify. Peer interactions and group dynamics play a significant role in shaping the high school experience. Through collaborative projects, shared challenges, and communal events, students learn not only about the subjects in their textbooks but also about empathy, communication, and the importance of diverse perspectives.  **Personal Growth and Challenges:** Navigating the challenges of adolescence, high school students undergo a transformative period of personal growth. Academic pressures, extracurricular commitments, and the quest for identity can be both exhilarating and daunting. Learning to manage time, cope with setbacks, and cultivate resilience are essential skills developed during these pivotal years.  **Preparation for the Future:** High school serves as a launchpad for future endeavors. College and career guidance, standardized testing, and exploration of potential professions equip students with the tools needed to make informed decisions about their post-high school paths. The experience of high school not only imparts knowledge but also nurtures the skills and resilience required to thrive in an ever-changing world.  **Conclusion:** In essence, high school is more than just an academic institution; it is a crucible of experiences that shape individuals on intellectual, social, and emotional levels. The academic rigors, extracurricular pursuits, social dynamics, and personal growth together form a rich tapestry of learning. As students embark on the journey beyond high school, they carry with them not only a diploma but also a wealth of memories, skills, and friendships that will resonate throughout their lives. High school is a transformative odyssey, preparing students not only for the challenges of higher education and careers but also for the broader canvas of life itself. **Conclusion:** The history of mathematics education reflects the continuous refinement and expansion of human knowledge. From the early stages of counting in preschool to the abstract realms of university-level mathematics, each educational phase contributes to a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts. The journey through math education is not merely a progression of skills but a dynamic exploration that shapes critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a lifelong appreciation for the beauty and universality of mathematics.

Man, I wish after he spun the line around the circle to pi, he did the full circle and got tau. What more creativity could TSC have done with tau?
They should teach math like this
what are all those symbols at the end
this is how i do math lol
petition for this to be a game
13.34 is interesting... yea am bad at math but idk wats that near the "e" ? that thing looks like zoophile (i hate it) symbol....
You should made the rest of the movie
Love the big alaph null in the background lol (idk if i am spelling that right but oh well) any vsauce enjoyers
man limes is horrible
This is the kinda stuff I’m thinking during math
I hate how there's no Explanation of Euler's Formula, Identity and so on that doesn't involve tons of jargon. I can't follow more than half a sentence before I'm lost.
It's so funny to have math knowledge
artttt😩😩😩😩😩😩
This take me to the old days when I am studying  maths and feel nostalgic 😊 😊
Next animation vs chemistry
I feel like everyone had this imaginary fight between himselfe and well the imaginary numbers ^^
Maybe the name of the music at the beginning
ahh yes youre braking my brain
You should do animation vs programming!
orange stickman is such a Σ
это эпичнее, чем трансформеры или мстители
I feel proud That I know almost evrything That has Been Shown In This Video :D
I am from Bangladesh and after watching this, I would say "জোস" 🔥

You turned my phone screen into a cinema like wtf?
Got literal goosebumps watching this!
10:55  Only the radius of the circle increased, but why did the center of the circle move?
bro 😭
Bro haven't meet x
This is kinda creative.
And how does orange teleport there?🤷‍♂
Animation vs. Programming. Html, CSS, Java, Ruby, then any other advancing programming languages. I think this would be a good fit for this style of video. This video is a master piece and keep up the great work!
TSC turned a graph into a railgun this is the power of math
Shout out to the person who made math fun
My math teacher told me to watch this.
This is the most intense video I've seen in a very long time. This fight was more intense than the final Luffy vs Kaido fight, WOW.
The creativity..
@spreen
i e (i*π)
Now I understand how people who struggle with mathematics feel like
i love mathematics
tf i just presensed
i can imagine tsc waking up like "i swear i was fighting the othe- oo number"
4:33 HE INCREASED THE FPS RATE!!!
heartful like to this masterpiece
10:02😂😂😂
wow
pefect
i was lost at 1+1+1
just beautiful.
Is the background song by imagine dragon children of the sky?
私はまだ中学生ですが、高校や大学に行ってこの動画の意味がすべて理解できるようになったらとても楽しいんだろうなと思います
bro i simply love your videos 😭😭😭 i watched them as a mere kid now i watch it as a computer science student (;
really brilliant
Euler is insane
This is Conceptually Terrifying
No need calculator every answer is here
(\_/) ( •,•) />>❤
4:01 I found you little buddy 😂 Edit: 7:19 found you again bruh 😂
It repetess
1+1=2
OMG THAT THING IN ALEPH-0, MY FAVOURITE NUMBER IT SHOWED UP! i mean i dont know anything about it j=i just picked a random that looked cool lmao. i was extra excited about seeing it bc in this video i litterally just searched up and learnt the symbol for it lmao and the symbol just shows up wheeee
Too much numbers at one moment for my small brain
infinity, how did we get to invinity??
ehheheh wowoahwoahswhwhowowo that crossbow
wait what its already five minuites?? i thought i havent even got started in the video yet
Que puta vídeo
I dunno man, everyone seems to like this but i think its just derivative, i think you might be reaching your limit
math is angry👿👿👿
hello this is  my fav alan vid
2:00 nice detail
10/10 so heartwarming🥰
math has never been so interesting
So nao entendi pq varias vezes o tiros do laranja nao pegou no e
Your videos is an art! That's so amazing! Thanks
Someone: You can't make good animations just by drawing stick figures. Alan Becker: ↑↑↑
11:04 hammer tim
Amzing WORK!
So this whole time this video just showed e to the i pi..
I loved your work. That was the first time I paused so many times an animation on which I was not working!!! Graphics and storytelling are brilliant.  It was a great informative and aesthetic moment. Thank you
Math matrix
Did i just watch a math war😨
I’ve never been scared by e^i(pi)
10:00  idk what star worlds u watch but that vedio is fire
give me Mathematics vs Biology pls
100÷3
bro exponential just pulled a domain expansion and thought we'll not see
i cant belive how that the little 1+1 turns into a marvel movie, captivated
➖1️⃣
at 10:15 when he was pushed to mid of circle ,i said "back to the origin"
This is astonishing
i only know 1 +1
Ngl i really want this to become a educational-battle royal game
数学Ⅲまでの知識では太刀打ちできなかった😇
My meal and I are still waiting for how it'll end
?
What about next animation vs math
Wait
Good
Please app name
You’d have to have massive knowledge of math to know what’s going on, especially because everything is very fast paced.
I suggested this to my online math tutor, I hope he enjoys (if he watches it)
I just found this video. This is so on point and I love it❤
Make animation vs quimic
this made sense and this didnt make sense
This needs to be a real game tbh.
O cara e o mestre da matematica
It's  amazing, future animation vs biology? @dateunblog
So accurate ❤🎉
Never would I have thought that this would continue to the Animator vs. Physics video!
Do you love Jesus? If you want to go to Heaven with him you must repent from your sins and Read and Obey the Bible everyday! You must preach his word to others! Jesus died on the cross so that you can have eternal life! He is the way, the truth, the life, and he will always be! He loves you, God bless!
the way he gets me to not like the letter e at the power of i and pi is crazy
I guess Greek letters are evil
1+1=WTF
I love it nd i am not even a nerd
Math
My dreams be like
I think we now need animation vs chemistry
Вот такую математику с радостью выучу
1+1=3😂😂
Average maths lesson Tbf
wtf is the א in the end for?
05:12
9:50 - 11:15 sounds like "Beneath the Crusts" from Deep Rock Galactic. I like it
gak bisa bahasa AMERIKA
One thing to say ,Alan has taught me more then school ever has.
Missing decimal numbers and fractions
🎉❤zzz🎉❤
I never thought of addition in exponentiation that way, thanks for the awesome video
數學的！！！
bro really just created a whole warfare simulation made out of nothing but a single stickman and complicated numbers ill never comprehend and called it a day
🙌🙌🙌🥹🥹🥹
animation vs math is not but it is animation + math
Part 2
Animation go crazy
Math vs Physics would be fun lol
TSC is SO smart about math!!!🎉
Bro turned into the death star 💀
Wowwowwow
Im not a big math guy, why is ei pi there so much?
Are you going to do animation vs history next ,Alan?
Why does the stick so obsessed with e?
Stunning
5:05
the ((iπ)^9)/9! is incorrect, its supposed to be 0.082145886611
Beautiful
2+2=4
For 5 month I discovered that the number of (1024) is the same as the MicroSD card It's the cheapest of the entire Nintendo Switch, reaching up to (1 TB) of Memory, I solved it 3:22
brilliant
the "exit" got me tbh
Much better than my math teacher, Alan. Keep it up! 😀
10:42 me when i have rail gun in any game that i have loads of ammo for
this guy deserve support.  but sadly, money goes for lust followers.
Everything is okay with numbers, until letters come into the math... is something like rocket science there
i x i x i = LIFE
12:00 TSC: *begs for forgiveness* e^(i*pi): Well, speaking as you shot a laser through my world, I guess I can forgive you.
I think I'm ready for my exam.
I'm the worst in my class in math. :"D (I didn't understand almost anything)
I wish this had existed when I was in school. I might not have hated math so much
I think this is a great video to learn
Look its titan aleph
How create death star using math:
bro explaned math on all level =s in 14 min
Hello everyone
EPIC
4:16 Alan, I think you are wrong in this part, e^iπ = cos(π)+isin(π) then -e^iπ = -[cos(π)+isin(π)] = -cos(π)-isin(π). Am I right? Because in the video you write -e^iπ = -cos(π)+isin(π)
Maths is wonderful.
These subject videos are amazing ❤
❤
1:39 math nonsense jumpscare
so cold
Thanks!
сновим  годам
God
pls do part 2 👇
I cried watching this 🥲
Miiiiiiiiiiiinnd Blowing!!! What a spectacular animation and concept!! WOW!!
3:21 3:21 ето просто ааа
Просто ти логік🎉🎉🎉🎉
dude this is insane
an angelic creation, brings tear to the eye definetly deserves x = (0; 10ⁿ) likes
7:18  bro Spawned at enemies base 💀
The final death star 🤣🤣
єто просто супер класс. самое крутое видео которое я когда  то видел в жизни
Godly
how long you make this to be done, it was 2 in 1 vide0, artist and scientist.
From basic math to math WAR... Funny how you depicted math being used during wars, even if you didn't mean to. This shows how even the SMALLEST number has BIG meaning!
HIT EM WITH THE -1
Imagine if colleges would make these type of games
Now, just looking at e^iπ, it feels as if it's alive and radiating cuteness.
А что там делает геганская א (Алеф)???
😂😂
10:30
No
Bro if this was how they taught math in school I would have 3000 IQ
so i didnt know about the  e^(i*π)  equation before this video really and just found out its the main boss of math pretty much if im terming that correctly... am i right? I clocked out at sin and cosin lmfao
And thats why you do not study logarithma kids
bro this this a masterpiece i leared just from watching this vid i keep whatching it and im bored u did out done urself keep up ur good work dude i think u deserve more sub then this man i subben and like every vid (:
this stikman is smarter than me
Swords and bows, to guns
From sticks and rocks
Basically society in a nutshell
İ am not Love math
At the end, the giant Aleph is so cool 😍 the way the small characters in the front ground make little noises while the colossal Aleph in the background sounds like distant thunder is too good!
e iπ
Please. Please Make An Movie Or  Game. P L E A S E .
This is what I always imagined math duels as
the aleph null at the end too damn
Can u do it with chemistry
Incrível
still not understand
POG: When somebody asks me what e and i stands for in math +1 to everybody behind this
Incredible
😂please make animations vs chemistry
part 2 broo
Excellent video!
Yo next can you do English?
wow!!!
one of the most badass math animation ever
There is a secret messadge
I dont give many videos a like, but this video is too good. Have your like.
I like how Alan starts from basic examples to advanced mathematics
So cool!
The way that orange used the × as a cross but rlly good anim nlg
And it all started with the number 1....

Bruh my brain has been OVERLOADED.BUT the video was cool 10/10.
las matemáticas no son aburridas, solo hacen falta más videos como este :)
hold on... imagine how smart you would need to be to make this video
Sure, the choreography is stunning, and the way the math is explained clearly in this abstract world is great, but how many people are discussing the EXCELLENT sound design?
As someone whos pretty bad at math and only really do basoc stuff, my brain hurt watching this
What's The CoDe
ÆK3EĒ2ÁÀK ëé JÜ 1
This taught better math than class
my mind on the exam
Why Alef was in the ending?
13:14 Need a break from all the stress? Then send yourself into another realm with THIS Equasion! e^pi=sum(2n=infinity, infinity)(pi^(infinity)/(2))/Gamma ((infinity)/(2)+1)
can we agree that math are evil
Fun fact: this video was released one say after my birthday
pra fazer esse video, o cara teve que ser o REI DA MATEMATICA
How does bro find a way to turn everything into a weapon 😂
The duels are epic.
This is amazing.
POV: Bored in math class
:D
OMG 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Waaaaaao
imagine if someone made this into a vr game, with all the different hand motions to convert the different symbols and stuff
how did  he get here?
Is this Canon
Man, this really remind me how much math I've forgotten (and never learned)
The people who barely knew this
11:20 i can only imagine how dizzy he was in that circle.
Было бы классно когда-нибудь увидетб что-то похожее по геометрии
Brilliant!!!!!!
3:04 If he went one step further, he would get tetration
I love fights and the beams and the math is so out of real life😊
7:25 hi akan beker i love your animator and mat
My brain in math class
Mom: stop watching youtube and learn math! Me:
These sound effects are stunnung
Imagine if this was a vr game
"Now I am become death... The destroyer of worlds."
When you turn math into a fight Is very amazing
복소평면까진 알겠는데 그 뒤론 무리...
you broken my brain + how much math knowledge do you have?

math lore
This video is how I went to college
i first watched this video as a watch party on discord with 2 friends who are extreme math nerds they kept pausing the video to talk about how accurate this is and hearing those 2 nerd out so much just confirmed that you diserve so much more of a budget, you are able to make such great storys with 0 diolog and simplistic character design. keep up the good work because ill be hard pressed to find someone able to make me interested in something i didnt care about before like this
Can you do physic ? 😢
I don’t know much about math but what was that big N thing at the end.
The new call of duty math is crazy 8:50
One thing to say, Alan has taught me more then school ever has.
6:46  Shadow Fight 2 reference 😂
does anyone know if there is some materials about explainging the whole stuff.
De las animaciones más épicas que he visto, es impresionante como las matemáticas reales infieren mucho en el desarrollo de la trama y no todo pasa por qué sí
이걸 보고 11살 아들이 내게 자꾸 수학을 물어본다...... 미안하다 잘 몰라서 ㅠㅠㅠ  After seeing this, my 11-year-old son keeps asking me math... I'm sorry. I don't know well😢
If tsc kept flipping every other equals sign into a plus sign like the first one he wouldve discovered the fibbinaci sequence (0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 ...)
I need my math teacher play this at school 🗿🗿
What my adhd mind thinks during math class
Orange went from solving math into playing stone story
Me, realizing e times i pi isn’t just some crazy math, it spells “exit”.
Come back to this comment in a year, to see how many views there are. 43M as of this comment.
You should do “Animation vs English”
Does anybody know what that thing big at the end of the video is supposed to be?
This taught me more math than school ever could
god
Who watched again this masterpiece after watching Animation vs Physics ?
Meth
"math is boring"
Imagine “=f(infinty)+ cos & sin
Kudos! This is one of the greatest math videos i have ever seen! Just for the comment, of course an instant like- i will just rewatch in :D
Missed opportunity to animate a number going to infinity using a supertask.
1+1=11? 1+1=2?
Me not understanding anything but still enjoying the fights: 😀
Background Music???
I have no idea what any of this means
"TheEnd"

Who's here after animation vs physics
What was that big guy at the end?
Hi
Bro is becoming smart!
Im still in pre school and this is confusing as hell to me
I love these type of stickman animations
😮 love
amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was not expecting aleph null in the end lol
That was a good video      Especially because there was a giant robot or something
| |   e^(i*π) |_______
I'm studying at the Faculty of Math in university right now and every month i come back to this masterpiece to see what new did i learn. When this animation came out i didnt understand anything besides the begining, now i almost got everything, and everytime it gets more and more interesting to analyse every small detail i notice  Thanks for it, it helps he understand that im getting better, smarter, and my efforts arent worthless
whats he doing? "hes beginning to believe."
13:35 i'm SORRY WHAT IS THAT THE ZOOPHILE IMAGE?!
Dude the creator is so smart 😮
I hate math, but this video has changed my point of view. Thanks,  Alan!!!!!!
the next is the physcis and the universe
Pov: when an animation teaches more than school 😔
Next Topic : Animation vs Chemistry Next Topic : Animation vs Biology Next TOpic : Animation vs Computer Science
Can yall explain why   e^(i*π) is the main antagonist here and why is it special?
at 10:44 man he did a whole nuke with math ( also me in math)
Bruh
math :)
This is so cool!!!
lesson learned: if you ever somehow end up in the void with weird numbers do all the these steps and for some reason try to catch the e
Help why are there letters in math?
Thank you for doing this you managed to help me more then any school  i love your work  i wish i could shake your hand
1+1=2
There is some physics in this video..
This is my favorite video of yours. it is so gooooood, i hav already watched it like 50 consequtive times. love your animations man. 😁
א
You must have had a long math class for that
数字というものはここから世界を作った感があっていい
Wow this so good
I love how Orange makes friend with e^(i*π) which means e^(i*π) will defend Orange on future videos (I think)
Who else came here after Animation vs physics  ?
this is awesome fr
im the first one here after animations vs physics
If a stick figure can do math why can't you?
What if.....you made a game like this....where the maths gets significantly advanced as the story progresses......and with the more you progress the more newer concepts you are equipped with which may carry over to help you later on as the story gets harder.
8:17 i can just hear the wii sports guy saying home run

Who came bc animation vs physics? Lel
correct: animation vs. the thing we hate
This entire madness all started with 1
My brain during math class
this is Groovy ending
That was the most aggressive VAAAA i ever seeen
I learned more math in 12 minutes from this video than over 10 years in school
You lost me at imaginary numbers aka the i. Also, what where those weird symbols at the end?
This needs a sequel, I need to know more about the math dimension
It's crazy how smart Orange is, he's such a fast learner that he could probably go to the real world if given a week in the math dimension
Гениальный мультик, который мог создать только гений.
Love the Ending where you can see Aleph Null Walking in the backround
Why is sigma here
Man this is so epic, this is like TETRIS'D level stuff. That series was awesome, and this could easily have an awesome game on it's own just like that series did. Granted the Tetris'd game was just kind of OK, but this right here has IMMENSE potential.
Okay so was that some sort of weird fever dream of TSC's or does this have some larger implications???  My guess is it has to do with his powers, especially in regards to "dimension hopping" like we see at the end here, similar to how The Chosen One entered Alan's PC in AVA 5.
Yo, I didn't know Terkoiz was a hardcore math nerd, that's really interesting.
This teached me more then school!
Bro that figure knows 1+1 0:16
What’s with the aleph at the end? It’s that a Hebrew letter?
Bro made math more fun then actual tv shows
Exactly what happened inside my brain when they started mixing numbers with letters during maths lessons
pi≠infinity (is pi the same as infinity?)
(33×33+33-33)÷0=infinity=infinity-infinity=0+1=1- infinity=-infinity
(33×33+33-33)÷0=infinity=infinity-infinity=0+1=1- infinity=-infinity
(33×33+33-33)÷0=infinity=infinity-infinity=0+1=1- infinity=-infinity
Which is your favorite stickman. Mine is Orange
this gave me the idea in our math comics .
I love how eiπ sceams at the battle btw😊
WOOOOOOOOOW
Is there gonna be a animation vs chemistry too?
ни чё не понял. Но очень интересно.
We all explore math in our own ways during Uni, and this would be so nice as another visual expression of number theory back then. Nice ride
This is one of the GREATEST videos ever made in the HISTORY OF INTERNET ✨
полная бесполезная хрень.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The ending is so sad🥹
😢😢😢
Well, that escalated quickly
TSC the type of stick figure to break the fabric of space and time, Just to get home
4:58 need to remember
Yes this is the Math 😎
数学勉強したくなるわ…
13:45 א 🙂 The first hebrew letter in the alphabet
Please make this into a game 🙏
Bro
please part 2
This seems pretty creative aswell, I loved how The Second Coming got to basic maths (1st grade) to the serious maths (9th grade)
I didn't understand the plot and most of the equations
It’s a masterpiece❤🥺OMG
I'm not smart enough to understand this one
I hate maths but this
Is so good
THIS ANIMATION IS SO AMAZING🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Will we ever see the return of the math dimension?
Bro, imagine the time it took tok make this
Amazing 😮😮🎉

how to teach your kids math! from simple addition to algebra and calculus!
Is there a chance I can turn this concept into a VR or Computer video game
Top demais! Parabéns pelo excelente trabalho. Irei apresentar aos meus alunos.
quien diría, la materia que millones de personas en el mundo detestan contra un simple hombre de bolita y palito, increíble...
My brain during math class
13:27 R.I.P. TSC 0:00-13:27
When you got to 7:00 you lost me
The battle between the stick man and e^(iπ) highlights the struggles mathematicians face in capturing, let alone developing, their ideas, discoveries, and inventions. We should always appreciate and be proud of them.
how to make an animation like you
Literally taught us everything in math from the first grade until college in 14 minutes 😂😂  And this how your brain feels when solving the math questions through these years😅( especially in the exams )🥲😅😂  Thank you Alan! ( And the one who gave you this idea )😁❤️👏
i know 1+1=2
Hey Alan do you make animation vs chemistry please 😭😭😭
Can this be my math class? We fight to 3 seconds down, using mathematics. That sounds awesome!
My Math teacher will be f*cking amazed if I send this to him.
Fun fact: the big number at the end is called null
Animation VS Science would be sick if you make it. Imagine TSC figuring out how to create the solar system
I love this video
Pls do more of these math videos my grandpa loved it
Creo que asi se debe de ver la magia real😮

meth sux!!
Cool
This goes to show the art is not about how realistic the animation is... Marvel gotta learn from this... I would watch  4 hours of this rather than any new releases from them... It's about the storytelling, plots, creativity and an actual amazing animator... A masterclass...
You can tell me the most hardest question in the world and I will figure it out in 5 seconds
This math is easy peasy lemon squeezy I am a kid also
So impresive i teached my brother and me math thanks
POV when u ask the teacher what u can use math for 💀
teachers should teach kids math using this video
My imagination during math class:
it would be spectacular if you do this but about the physics
I think we find the next Albert Einstein
Alan doin the calculations 💀💀💀💀
In 4 minutes orange learned the Same amount of math I did in 8 years....
Bro found the 4th dimension 💀
Yeap, giant Alef at the end is a true math guard... Extremely beautiful!

Hacking into nasa be like:
It feels good to be e^i(pi)

B00m🌌🤔?
Richard Watterson Was a God on this gameplay
The animation is just beyond amazing. This is something they should show in a math class!
Principal: who is you maths teacher?  Me: AlanBecker
MORE PLEASE!!!!
My brain at math class be like
0:21 how much we used in grade 96?
Dude, you've just made my day! GREAT THANKS!🤗
ANOTHER! Please, please, PLEASE make a sequel!
This is beautiful. I didn't understand all of the math presented but enough to understand what was going on and this was just...holy cow this was fantastic.
This makes me want to learn math
When you're an animation and math double-major XD
1 +
Was that the Yankees logo at the end
很享受這種知識從左耳進右耳出的感覺
One of my fav videos of yours
If you want that and you want that your family is not me and not in Moscow within the range from on Skype, I can at any moment you can I don’t like that I’m not that much and I can’t do knitting lessons to I understand everything, what is the problem with payment for I don’t g I can go to any place in the world to school, I can at any convenient time for communication so that we can send you to our warehouse and in this case we cannot find in Andrey, I can do homework, one of the most popular and sought-after activities in the field of sales to school, I won’t be able to help you to school, or I can at any moment, it may become outdated, I don’t know Undertale I can’t do it, you can do the lessons using I can at any time convenient for you on the road at any time
Sonic X The Beginning of the legends and myths of ancient Greece and Rome in I can’t find your phone number to contact on Skype I won’t be able to come to you and your company I don’t know how I understand I can at any convenient time
This is the 3rd time I’ve watched this
I want MORE!!, Honestly I'm imagining another video in where 0 wakes up, realizes it's true power and nearly destroyed it's mathematical land, like Imagine 0 being a villain in the maths universe
Waiting for Animation vs Physics. Also chemistry.
Actual footage of sir Isaac Newton inventing calculus
wow you made a lot of details in this🎉
wow you made a lot of details in this🎉
As a 5th grader, I'm scared of what I'll be learning in middle school and high school now.
e¡ M
Thx alan becker! Im ready for exam:)
1+1=2😊
2😅
Nonton video ini langsung banyak rumus nya 😵😂
9999(little 2) =99980001
I KNOW EVERYTHING OF THIS!
We need animation vs mеth
Bence oyunu yapılabilir
That Natural numbers at the end really got me😅
Bro where is X and its problems
Damn TSC learn Math very fast😂❤
animation vs chemistry 👇
Ничего не понятно но очень интересно
Oh wow the X at the end was massive beautiful animation keep it on
what program was used to make the animation?
ㅐㅜㄷ…
world record learn
I need a part 2 of this!
I have no idea what happened here, as I'm an absolute mathematical imbecile, but it was SPECTACULAR.
Question: How did he get here
I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor. The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was at 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Cat dancing has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

So much great graphic design, so much suspense, so much greatness in this one video. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life.

I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
I will be die if i do that math

If I was a college teacher I would let my students watch this
GIANT N
This is such a great marriage of art and math
هلا نعم الوكيل الشعريه
Bro this just taught me all the math I've learned in my 14 years of life in 14 minutes
最高におもしろい！！
I wanted the background music.
This should be used to teach in schools, it's awesome! ❤️
Bro💀
Just imagine theres a game about this and it will be epic
Thank you for showing me what sin and cosin is. I've spent who knows how many years working with mathematics, I'm a computer science major, and your visual demonstration is the first time I've had someone show me what it is instead of just how to plug it into an equation.
mind blown
pou
I have no idea what happened but I liked it all the same.
What is the music?
Unit circle 5:14
Very interesting!! How can I contact you for a particular request?
Will he retain this power of the universe when he makes it back to his dimension?
Amazing
I think you should make a part 2 because kids should learn more math
Man went from 1+1 to powers in 5 minutes
This somehow made me wanna learn advanced maths
What a masterpiece ! I love it!
Awesome incredible no words to describe just a piece I appreciate but um school students left the chat😅
i am officially questioning my existance
It's Amazing!
Real fight Begins 7:25 🥳🥳
I’m a high school student and today at math class we spent the whole class watching maths videos and this was one of them , writing this for a memory 😂
If this is a video game:  TSC: Main Character e^ipi: Antagonist  Weapons: bow, Crucifix, Sword, The dot
アーベル総和法に、似てる。
I won’t him to make a nuther one of these and I wish it was in VR it would be so fun love your videos and shorts
I want another part
can someone tell me what is the sound name
ok you 👏😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎vivi
Nooooooooooooo aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
No no no no no
Ok  you      YouTube     NG_Rasyid ok 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😅😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎

You wow ok 1+1🤔
I... hope this isn't what the education system is expecting us to do...
More videos like this please
All this is absolutely awesome! <3 !
5:32 aint no way orange made a perfect circle
5:37 Theta guy
The END
you should make more animation vs math with the gang
This creator is a genius. the video is so mathematically correct and all of it makes sense. All the maths shown in this video are 100% real and facts. And the story was amazing. Thanks for such a masterpiece.
Me. Seeing this as a std4 students 😂
This is exactly what i have in mind when doing math exam
Can’t believe I learned something from a stick figure animation
I love that the _base of everything_ is just the description of _equalities._
What is this my brain broken
I saw pi made a 180 around the unit circle with θ/r but then for the waves i was put with the horizontal sin to make it basically like cosin, going vertically and giving two dimensional shape. So if you were to only go 90 degrees or 1/4 of the unit circle, would θ/r=i or pi/2?
I really liked it 😳,I'm sri lanka👍👍
Bro TSC won a 1v1000000 alone
Wow
How is this teaching me how math works better than what most math teachers try to do?!
What about an animation vs science next?
Olso somone made this is minecraft
I'm impressed good job I love it
Perhaps integrate a bit more into this by adding in some harmonic series with a bit of FFTs and have them start playing various sounds - notes, cords, etc... Then by the end of the video have the animations playing Beethoven's Symphony 9 where the actual notes and instruments are represented by their mathematically correct functions, series, etc... It'd make for a great composition! You could have i as the director of the symphony...
amazing
Sorry for those who don't like math, I hope it wouldn't be your dream before u sleep😅
I hope this video will convey the beauty of mathematics to future generations. 😊
VC🇧🇷
Scheiße ist das gut. 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
I cried watching this tho gtg
What is the music?
my favorite thing was the music!
Man knows more math than a certified Asian.
‰
the fact that the number 1 can hold university math is mind blowing…
Now we need animation vs science
I love this animation...also does anyone know what equation would make a grenade
did anyone else notice the giant "א" at the end?
en que momento te volviste profe de mates???
7:37 the numbers of pi after shooting
так вот доя чего нужно математику учить
Sorry but, how's  θr= π (a bit perplexed)
This one is getting an Oscar
I’m in high school and let me tell you a lot of this stuff I am worried I will learn. Seriously tho this animation is impressive.
How did TSC get to math land? Did he fall into the calculator function of the computer or something. How does this fit into the timeline!!!
damn, why is this video entertaining me that much
What is that!!! Noooo!!! 😭😭😭
Next is Animation vs. Music?
That's the creative and brilliant way to understand via animation..still most of concepts are too much beyond compare to simple.math
Only dream can like or commit
P🍖
Could someone explain to me the lore behind this
This reference 11:42 from Animation vs Minecraft when blue saves baby piglin from zombie men and gain trust from baby piglin.   Similar to this situation The Second Coming saves Euler and gain trust from Euler.
Euler says goodbye to The Second Coming 13:18
The Second Coming befriends Euler 12:00
The Second Coming saves Euler 11:29
The Second Coming : It’s time to kill Euler with = f(.pi) gun and roll into a ball and escapes the black void 11:20
The Second Coming : It’s Time to kill Euler’s clone and Mathzilla with f(.) cos tsin giant radius gun pew pew 10:34
Euler assemble into a Mathzilla 9:45
The Second Coming : Let’s delete Euler’s Clones with f(Infinite)= gun
The Second Coming : It’s time to kill Euler’s Clones with the Calculus gun 8:34
This fight scene starts at 4:38
1 + 1 = 3 Guys
A game that uses calculations as attacks, different types make different attacks. The complexity of the calculation would make the move more powerful, but any mistake in the calculation will backlash onto you, making it so that you actually need to learn how everything works.
More of this! All the math/nerdery! You should do a part 2. Or 3. Or part 𝝅! ALL THE MATH!
honestly, learning maths would be way better in a environment like this, but you're pretty much alone soooooo
TSC(the second chance / orange) pass the exam
I love the detail of e^i(pi) disappearing by making it-self imaginary.. I didn’t even pick up this detail until the 4th rewatch 1:50
12:25 Just caught that the stick man was asking e for the exit.
How he can learn math so fast?🤔
Хочу выучить математику чтоб понять это видео
The soundtrack sounds like it's from Halo 5 "The Light is Green"
Gràcies!
How it feels like to wait till math class is over

I didn’t know I can get chill from seeing a radius double 😂
I'm a Vietnamese chemistry student and I really want you to make a video similar to this about chemistry
this made me know the use of ( )  i study in brazil, 5th grade, happens that in brazil we have a diffrent teaching manner people from usa prob learned this in 3rd grade
People who want to be put in a video 👇
orange is so smart
Bro turned matt in a cool battle💀
this is beautiful!
💪   {26-11-23 1;29h}
2 = 2 = 5. 2 + 2 = 5 because 20 - 20 = 25 - 25. Now, take that and turn it into 5x4 - 5x4 = 5x5 - 5x5. Now, turn that into 4(5-5) = 5(5-5). 5-5 = 0. So 4 = 5. Therefore, 2 + 2 = 5.
I only just realized that when tsc did the exipi, it spelled exit
Yeah im not going to school😅
please make a game
I'm trying to know more Basic Maths and Advanced Maths with that video😅
what was the last symbols that appear in the video? I only identified phi, and the gigant??
in my interpretation the white place is all of the irrational numbers  and in the end where all of th

we NEED a part 2
too much math today, I hate this
My brain hurts. :)
i love that show so much
Intense math fight
Genius!
This video is Sick and fire, one of my favorite videos, keep up the good work!

Holly god,FCFM need to see this
Bought tears of overwhelming joy to my eyes.
Um  a  e  Match  from  stickman   Orange!
Um  a.
incredible
Me when i actually listened in maths
POV me in school
This is the universe of mathematics. It is infinite.
This should really be a game
Was he killed, or sent home?
You made math fun
Now find the derivative of that.
TSC explained how useless maths are in 14 minutes
Talk about a +1 sword or a +2 bow huh? (Dungeons and Dragons)
Ө is look’s like Mongolian letter Ө
I turn vide to hight brightnes , i can see N walking at end

А куда буковки в конце пошли?
I don't understand any math in this
why did the plus end:(
wow
7:10 execusion funnel from portal 2 lol
Этот чувак узнал за 14 минут про математику больше, чем я за 9 лет
圖形化的解說，讓公式瞬間被理解，這個太棒了
Cool animation broo
looks like Null has live a long life with his childrens.
Why am I watching math in thanksgiving break
One point in math has a lot of value
That's crazy dawg
Me seeing all the math problems: 🗿
To escape just throw a ÷0 at e^i pi and watch as it turns into a black hole
Bro was a math teacher for 14:02 thanks though
So Cool🤩
I watched this video and then got an A on my test because of it thank you
Omfggggg, when the sigma titan unlocks integral calculus and obsorbs the energy waves from what ever kind of trigonometry cannon being fired at it was epic xD
So,  Euler is the main antagonist of math, eh?
11:06
O:15 achievement made: it all starts as 1
This is simply beautiful

Bro learned math faster than the human kind 💀💀💀💀💀
No one cant study math in 14 minutes! This video:
Die coolsten Videos der welt
Son sahnede gözleri dolan bir tek ben değilimdir değil mi ? Am I the only one crying in the last scene ?
Most funny that I say can I do homework do my teacher he say ok and I will do it
١:١_-٢
This is beautiful to me
Euler's identity in Bourne identity style. Love it. 😎
fgujbjk  hjui😂🤣
4:23 that was so clever. Orange stickman got hit by - sign and his direction flipped. Smart move
Professora de matemática do Alan vendo isso:
Animation idea: Animation vs. meth
I thought Orange was gonna create the Universe (desktop) or something
Can we also appreciate the soundtrack. It feels like The Second Coming is in an ethereal area and it feels great for his learning of math.
Creatiom of the cos and sin waves gave me eyegasm
I would LOVE to see a animation vs Science, i think that would be so cool to see!
P🍖
e|iπ Prime example would have the most common choice of people that I have ever seen it was in my life that the world was it just the same thing?
Did you know that 0-1 is equal to -1?
Wow
This is so cool
The Chosen One vs the Negative One.
Well... Orange has 3 allies that are stealing the parameters: –,r and θ
I feel like i'm watching interstellar with the math and the music
@alanbecker You should totally have an animation of a stickman trying to deliver a data packet through a network and all the ups and downs that entails. Would be interesting to see firewalls and packet sniffers, IP addresses and the sort in your style of animation.
Squareroot -1 = i
This man is make my homework!
Aleph at the end towering over all of them and being made out of the actual fabric of reality is absolutely poetic
Amazing 👏👏🤩👏🤩👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

holy mother of god he actually made math cool
I just know a math teacher is going to show this video and have students explain at least one advance equation on screen
What is e^(i*π)
Beginning to Understand Math-
Made me laugh several times - a great video!
Man who ever came up with this really wanted a promotion
So now that you got math down, how about physics?
7:00 T O O   S A T I S F Y I N G
!i!i!i!
Orange is getting smarter then me a 9th grade
Haven't enjoyed a mathamatics cartoon this much since Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land
I convinced my algebra teacher to play this video after a quiz tomorrow.
e iπ God Alan
Bro spent too much time on the calculator.
This is cool❤️❤️❤️💝
How to make math both fun and enjoyable. Also was anyone else getting huge Iron Man vibes from this lol?
Send this to your maths teacher atleast he will have a perfect movie for saturday movie night
This is the timeliness where the second coming becomes the villain
It was interesting to watch
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
ZOOPHILDLE💀💀💀💀💀💀🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
This might be an movie I wanted to see Animation vs. Math II to V Might be Physics
So this is what they meant when they said that we would need  math in real life
Roti kha liya ki kya hua hai kya hua hai kya hua hai to you 😝😝 7

So he killed and tricked him in the end? I dont understand
Went from enemies to friends🤩
simple sqare roots and everything under it😅🤣😅🤣
The math teacher needs to show their classrooms to the students about this
if math can make machines
i made the strider math
what happened when you play with your math test too much:
here before 1qa vewes
This is by far my favourite of all the Animation vs series. Stupendously well done.
the way you animated the numbers is really cool
The + End = Sin⁵
why does no one recognize his power in this, yes Ava he’s op but he shot out WAY bigger beams that could destroy a lot of ground, tsc destroyed the -world .
the perfect video to eat cheese to
Top
the animation teached me more than my maths teacher
the reason we sacred at math:
My maths teacher always talked about the mathematical plane and how, when he is explaining maths, we must not disturb the flow of mathematical particles. I always wondered what this mathematical plane looked like.  Now I know.
1+1=?
It’s confusing, but also entertaining
He could flip the i and do factorials
Oh hell nah orange was in the void💀💀💀

Bro come on why is orange not the one doing Redstone  If he can do this  Then he also must understand how Redstone *realy* works  But no we got            /   \ This  I🛌I.   🟡⚒️🎢
Learn Mathematics at University to Understand this video.
The sound design in this is spectacular
Love the giant aleph at the end that is almost hidden
This is amazing !!!
这质量可以冲击拿奥斯卡最佳动画短片吗
I like how good the animation is, and the fact that its exciting to watch even though its about math.
ultmate school be like :
Nah, if this was crazy, imagine how crazy Animation Vs. Science will go. We need confirmation of a sequel!
math lore
Thanks for 25 million subs from alanbecker
E again 12:12
e????????????
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵
Math bow ?
Orange is getting smarter every millisecond
That is a E?!
That E is attacking that stick mam
So, I don't recall, what is the e?
Math lore:
It is fun
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I understood half of it but I was lost in the end
TSC is for real speed running math, I won't be shocked if he got into Harvard.
I didn't understand anything, but the animation was very good 10/10
eigaaga𝓈𝓋𝓈ℊℊ𝓈𝓋
I like you made =f(•) and =f(♾️) guns
those chains are insane enough to unite enough everyone,,,, it is useful but the game would start as the chain would've applied that's the unity would be exist also it has limitation it cannot interact the very edge of the universe by which the universe is expanding [    ]
10:28 bro made a fkn railgun using math
Lasted upto 11th
HELP I'M ADDICTED
I think orange's dreaming, or probably got in that pitch black void or new experiment from the secret agent from "Wanted"
Sir please explain In detail how f infinite power hold it. How. In mathematics. 😅 9:59 minutes
Wow. What a explanation. Really good. I think k you are craziest guy. ❤❤❤
The calculator app is crazy
I think i got a brain damage
I know the propretys of additon
E pov WAAA
The only time math is fun
Bruh now I wanna know math
9:13 :3
Damn,TSC is a very good teacher!
This guy showed how maths can be fun and not painful
Ok ok thanks for teaching me
inanamıyorum bunu nasıl yaptın omg
ummmmhmm
9:30
bro tsc is smarter than me
More math than my teacher taught me
what the flip is going on. was that lheters
hi what game is this
This video is art
Math has never been more fun to watch.
Tuyệt vời
Itni gateway video mat banana kra
Orange got a Death Star
i hope i can understand every single math concept in this vid one day
😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😊😊😊❤❤❤😮😮😮😅😅
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE ❤❤
As a mathematician, i find this very satisfying to watch! I can't understand all of it, but i do get a bit more than i realized.

You Can Do It TSC
NAH, JIT MADE MATH INTO A VIDEO GAME!
1+1>2. Phân tán toán học.
it's like a pov learning math from every grade
I watch this when I’m high
The explanation video I want is one that keeps track of what TSC has in his inventory at any given time.
Can someone explain the ending to me?
sequel with the other characters in the ending scene when
PLS DO PART 2
10:43

Bravo
Pi Number is very GOOD
Cos + sin = Cosint
Bro just taught all of the math that teachers teach in 12 year while he is teaching it in 14 minutes

1:39 My Favorite Number
This was STUPID creative ✨
wait until someone convince their teacher to watch this with the class
4:42 BE GONE SATAN
What
I cant wait for Math: The Anime
Moral of the story, dont do math.
I pooped my pants here 0:00
Next will be animation vs physics, chemistry, biology =)))
nice live😊 dreamist!!
So.. The meaning behind this video is that math is hard.
TSC is learning math 😂
OH HI WELCOME TO MY SCHOOLHOUSE!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️  K but seriously but this reminds me of Baldi.
هذا يتتطلب فهم عالي جدا للرياضيات
try to kill euclers number simulator
Which of the following options is Orange?  A.FRUIT B.colour
My brain cant handle the numbers i m feeling that its freakin melting 😮
F to gun
perfect animation i love it
cool
I love how orange isn't scared by the fact about he is just in a empty world 😮
Why does this make math look fun
Welp orange now has harvard grade education
It’s crazy how orange learned about all of math in 14 minutes and we often learn nothing in a whole day😂
I cant believe how much complicated math came from the number 1
I like when he starts to use the dot
One must imagine the second coming happy
11:05 bro was out for blood 💀 ☠️
I̶ l̶i̶k̶e̶ t̶h̶e̶ E̶u̶l̶e̶r̶s̶ f̶o̶r̶m̶u̶l̶a̶ j̶u̶s̶t̶ h̶a̶s̶ f̶r̶i̶e̶n̶d̶s̶ l̶i̶k̶e̶ z̶e̶t̶a̶ a̶n̶d̶ o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ m̶o̶r̶e̶😊
I like that orange made a infinity rifle
anyone noticed the Aleph at the end?
This NEEDS a sequel
Alan destroyed Einstein in math
ie
Black color is the real dimension
Last thing someone could've exoexted is seeing domain expansion here lol
The way this is easily explain how complex maths are makes me enjoying math classes.
WOW THAT SO COOL! Y love Orange si much!
Show this to a math teacher and they lost their minds on how much they enjoyed it
My head is pening😂
My teacher should show this in my math class
Therapist: exp(i*pi) is imaginary, it can't hurt you.   Mathematicians: *this video*
Fenomenal!
waho wow i love it [my 🧠 jcgcydyt if uyfduyduygcf,fiyg] hi
e can rebuilt the math society and have a village
Animation Vs FNAF
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
this is how i see my math papers. just i draw on any empty space that dosent need work on it.
that giant thing at the end
baldi will be mad about that
eiπ
This Is how to learn math without school
this is getteting deep
You learned me more than shcool
интересно очень
Really cool
this is awesome video
I'm really expert at math for like solving promblems.
0:19 1+1=3
muy matematico
me gustan tus videos
grandioso lo que isistrvien
my theory is that he is in a simulation while he is asleep/passed out in the cage in ava VI and got out with the e guy's help
You can make up lotta stuff dividing into twos
2:56 NaN cuts off the panic loop
1+ brain cell.
I wanted all the guys who helped the bat, or the bat himself, to reach the final battle of this entire story. *or they became friends, or something*
Me: falls asleep in math class for 0.01 seconds The teacher during my sleep:
This is the greatest thing I've seen today, maybe this week, month, year? I don't know what matters is that it is extremely great
🤪🔪数学💦
this is on youtube kids
theory: this was a dream when he was captured
school be like:
Whats 9+10
(∞)f=
I love how he dose a straight on homerun
Hoe did he make a perfect circle
Hey, this was so beautiful it made me cry.  Thank you for the experience.  I wish I could keep up :)  What a magnificent piece of Art. Make no mistake, this will be the birth of some childrens love of mathematics.
Your videos are awesome
The 2 x 2 = 4 bow feels like one of those weapons that you get in the early game and it carries you, but you get a better weapon in the late game and never use it again
math rlly is fun
This video makes math no longer boring.
That is sick like I don’t even know what to say I am speechless to how good the animation was I am about to cry
Вау! Нужно этот ролик уже ставить на полки музея Ютуба
OP
TSC Vs Math Full Version!!😲😲😲😲😲
Math 🐐

PLAY ANIME STICKMAN Sábado 09:30
I like this.
That’s a good story
TSC has higer potential than me.
e
Me waiting for "animation vs science"
NOW THIS IS HOW WE SUPPOSED TO LEARN MATH
that is amazing of matematiks of my life i never seen that before so thanks alan becker you change my life of happiness, if you do a new episode do that again pls i wanna see it again, if you do a fighting lesson you can do like that too, thank you mate you hange my life
Long math division
Level bro level, u are really a mathematics genius 😮😮
Cant help but think of the game Intelligence Cube when watching this. The music in an all black background really harkens back to it, gives that space feel.

so cool
Не знала что примеры бывают такими интересными
SKEPDWVOSZ❤❤❤ SOZEYXB❤❤❤
Can’t wait for the day that I can fully understand this video
When I saw the second coming/orange with a shotgun of math I just thought of America in that second American mass is never been so traumatizingly awesome
Bro this is just a dyslexic kid in math class
Hi
What??
Knowledge truly is power.
cpu burnt
100+100=200
1+1=2 3+3=6 2+2=4 10+10=20
This is an impossibly good animation
3:06
claro profe, si entendi
bro unlocked universal math
What. I dont fink that math can be so epic
Математика 1+1=2
Таблица умножения 1+1=1
This is what teachers mean when they say you'll need math.  Also, was that dome sort of Quantum physics at the end? When they brought him back?
1:05
Going school ❌ Watching Alan✅
minute 8:29
e^(i*pi): *hopping around* Taylor: *shooting numbers* Mecha: "WAAAAAAAAAH!!"
This should be aired in schools worldwide at least once
Bro took maths to while another level 9:13
hey guys  and alan becker
Study math with stickman 😂😂😂😂
I dont understand most ofthe  video but it is still fun
.
Better than Msheu Movies 💯💀
Alan is very beautiful and interesting! you'll understand all the math for all the videos You watched and almost went straight to the 11th grade! Suitable for those who do not want to learn math))
Don't get anye😢
11:00 I love how orange readjusted the circle graph even though it has enough wide range to obliterate the e’s anyway
Bro release a cross😂 4:41
I don't get whats happening but epic fight!!!
Do the Stickman have a inventory I’m confused about that
My brain when answering math questions
the fact that the math is still right is mad
Esto es mejor que skibiri toilet
What's ∞+∞+1/0=?
This is my fav Animation Episode in my life 9:50 😅
0:36 💀
uhm how did he get here???? and people need to put this into lore and find out
I showed my math teacher the math robot and she loved it
Las matemáticas dan miedo
Let me guess,animating is the easy part of this animation, doing the maths is hard?
Like always amazing
😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
11:21  epic bro
If you were my mom's son, she would have been the most proudest person she could ever been lmao 😂  This video is basically me in a math test.
What is this Software
Remember, this all started from 1.
calculator gameplay (real)
if i can do all that in math, then I'm going to go to AP Calculus BC
"WAAAAAAA!!"           -e on the mecha

Itu matematika anak SD
This is how our math teachers should teach us
imagine waking up and ur just in desmos
Напомнило игру алхимия где нужно было смешивать разные ингредиенты что бы получить что-то новое
Totaly love how TSC just casualy makes a weapon of mass disteuction Edit:i also like the titan N at the  end (i have no idea what it is)
Julian Dörfler daily activities
What is he that expresses fun, mathematics, and creativity?
😊😂😅
Alan becker casually writing down the answers while orange did the map 1000000 iq no need to work or study LOL
at the end bro fr snapping kid outta reality💀
Honestly dis is just so cute😭
Last time the end was crazy there was literally a giant symbol Ñ~
Minimal kasih translate indo

I wish I was good at stickman animation
The second coming vs math magician
It appears TSC has become a math genius
Is is most hard π^e
Holy hell, one of the most creative animations I've seen.
Can you do animation vs kirby
Can you do animation vs kirby
Очень классно я все части смотрел а можно с озвучкой по русски

4:04 naaa ya se fue a la mrda no entiendo nada
im in school but we havent learned about like that big N thing at the end can someone explain?
did you see the aleph null?
Its so cool but zamn after the 30 secs Idk whats being talked about anymore
this is brilliant for animation and math
And please make the Animation vs. Art or Animation vs. science
He is smart...
the next video should be animation vs physics , this would be soo amazing
excellent👌👌
Now we need Animation vs. DnD
За 14минут он узнал всю школьную программу

If there is no part two, I will go to your house and we gonna have a little talk.
Make a sequel!
Thanks!
Ok 1+1=2
Is this canon?
Im so lost
Watching this video is a damn surreal experience.
If I could change the title, it would be: "Homework"
SoY tu fan
Did anyone notice the Aleph Nole at the end?
Kudos to anyone and everyone that thought of this. True genius! 🎉
😢 9:eyeglass
anazing😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
マジですごくて感動した
Bro reached better than my math teacher
Animation Vs Physics when?
"Orange casually creates a Death Star"
My man asked how much of this math do you know to me. ME ?? I still struggle to believe that 8 x 7 is 56.
This has taught me major math than a teacher appearently
wonderful
this make math fun
I love how it became a 1th grader math to 12th grader math
10:02
Imagine if math was this interactive and as well as visual effects math would not be so boring to do in classes
It starts from 1 to college math
this is just beyond amazing
4¹=1 4²=2 4³=4 4⁴=8
HEY ALAN BECKER WHY IM NOT IN CHAT?!
Lol I learned more from this video than math class
10:02😂😂😂
ə
If i was a math teacher, I'd play this on Friday
naw he made a math class and ended in 14:02
wat
This is the coolest way to learn math
alan i think you are stressed after this animation
anybody know what this is? 13:47
i feel dumb now
I have never wanted to learn more about math than I do rn lol
Theⁱⁿ Eⁱⁿnd
Me at the start: Ooo sc discovered math  Me at the end: A WAR HAS BEGUN.
Let’s get a sequel
ah, this is why we learned math, to understand Alan Becker videos.
Bro made math the universe
bro teached the all grades math in one video
Ajarin matematika dong puh Sepuh 🥺🤯🤯🥳😤
Yes orange super good👍🏼
😂
Ошибка! -1-1-1 = 1 а не -3 чтобы получить -3 нужно -1 + (-1) + (-1) (Моё мнение) Знаю что меня никто не заметит особенно русские
ALL HAIL e^(i*π)
This animation teaches math better then every school.
Everybody gangsta until Albert Einstein comes in 💀
Black hole 😳😳😳😳😳
Bro is tryna finish Einstein's work
There was a war at school Math teacher:  8:29
Yea my brain going to error cuz of maths
Isin and cos lazer was op
This channel is crazy
bro my math class watched this in school (im not kidding it actually happened)
the infinity hammer gun laser was the most overpowered thing, in your other episodes of stuff lets have tsc just pull it out and obliterate the villains or whatever  I REALLY WANT MY OWN INFINITY HAMMER GUN THING IM USING THE CONCEPT FOR THIS STORY IM WRITING
what are those things at the end, especially the big thing???
Bro learned the whole math in 14 minutes.
Bro did a better explanation at math then most, if not all, teachers.
Teach our how you made this video. The softwares
Bro if I remembered all of this I could be the smartest in my class
10:02 nah that scream is too perfect
Part 2
this math is math
I feel bad for e
Now I love math! 😊
Damn, this is cinema 🗿
The creativity on this is insane made math into a actual entertaining video
Number 1 0:06 = 0:13 + 0:19  number 2 0:19 number 3 0:28 number 4 0:31 number 5 0:32 number 6
My brain went like🤯🤯
This is just cyberchase's concept in a nutshell
Why can the orange stickman can learn maths more faster than me
esta buenisimo para la secundaria
wow
Zeta,Phi,Delta,Theta and Aleph
Hmm.... Returning to this after the AVA 6 Ep 2, gives me a theory...
The real math, it`s amazing!!!But hard
Math is BIG
Alan becker dosent need the math teacher he needs MATH CROWN👑
1+1=2😂❤
😮а чё без звука
This made me wanna learn math. WILLINGLY
My IQ now 157🤓
I had to go to Wikipedia, and remember the constant, Euler's calculation, with addition, multiplication and exponentiation, if I remember it was possible to generate an infinite drawing of itself, or was it with Z and . but it's very complex and fantastic
So this is Tony Stark
bro made math look like a fun subject
When you literally have to finish college just to understand its whole lore
Сюжетный поворот: всё происходило в калькуляторе
Imagine if TSC’s math skill caught up to him later on in the AvA series
e^(i*π
Bro what an actual beam😱😱 11:04
This was a better maths lesson that my actual mass lesson
Literally, this is Unbleveable
me watching this : mom Im studying math
Animation vs lego
1+1=4!
COMING SOON THE EPISODE 2 THE BOX - ANIMATOR VS ANIMATION!
hmm e^(i*π)

Is anyone aware he just made a perfect circle first try.
I want to animate so good to
10:03
Hello Alan, I wanted to tell you for a long time that you could create a video with the stickman vs the purple monkey! We will give you 1000,000 likes if you do it! Do you think it can?
bro learned more math in 14 mins than i did in 17 years 💀
Bro what math is this your little man is not il any more

Math is deep.
Waltuh i am cooking meth.
How kids imagines math
math mixed with animation feels like im in college
It is brilliant! I understand the math till 8:40.  Math is magic!
It's amazing
Tanks you alanbecker
ÑÑÑÑ Ñ Ñ
you somehow managed the impossible and made math unironically cool, what _can't_ you do with these stick figures?
This is well engaging and full of fun!
On 9:10 he took Star Wars to another level
Can I just ask what was that creature at the end? No really am i the only to saw it?

The power of math
1:41 it's an Euler's formula
This just made me realize how ignorant I am. I understand the first minutes of this show; the rest is literally Greek to me - yet I loved it. But... could anyone explain what happened to the orange guy at the end? Quantum physics?!
I would love to watch a video about networking, protocols and em waves and all those . I would be so cool . This is awesome 👌 🔥🔥🔥👍
Hari krishn guru maataji 🙏🙏
Why this doesn't have billion views yet ?
So cool
That was the most impressive thing I've seen so far ngl
Amazing
zero no no no no😂

Bro he's smart🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😲😲😲
someone needs to make a game like this, minecraft esq survivel wave based game where your option is to learn more math to eventually build your self a way out
M-m-my brain just exploded hello??

I really want a part 2
Alan Becker is a genius,i never see a man inteligent from the math!
when 😂
‏‪2:27‬‏ ‏‪2:28‬‏  😮
why math is so harddd😢
I'm just like dying of how complicated the math things is
rip my brain2023-2013
I wan't petting Euler's Identity because it cute :D
Only yellow can understand this stuff😅
Transformers : the age of expansion 😂
The scream at 10:01 😂
수학이 되는 공부 같아요
This inspires me to do my homework
Me: *Doesn't understand what most of these symbols mean.* Also me: *Still enjoys it in its entirety.*  This animation alone is proof that understanding and enjoying something are two different things, though I'm sure if I understood what all the little symbols meant, I'd enjoy it more.
I actually didn't understand until now
now the math They have senses  ¿What is 1+1?
Now I know what 2 +2 =1 is
Math in Alan Becker 😊 Math in school ☻
Wow, I haven't visited this channel in a WHILE
This made math work for my ADHD brain
comment if you like science
but i like the end
like and subscribe if you hate math😡😡😡
Yo I just saw something... 16:27:30
For what at no number13?
א
If I had the same math lessons, I would be an excellent student.
Alan becker did you know that you are a legend
So bountiful🙂❤️
my brain during math me like
This is.... Beautiful.
My mind really scattered after watching this. Awesome
Just wonder😮
BRO WHAT!!!

The most confusing stuff in gods great world
Eeeeeeee had me dying😂

Что оранжевый делает что у него такие сны?
once again alan breaks the law of almost everything
The start was intriguing, the middle was intense, and the end was heartwarming. This isn't just an animation, it's a masterpiece and will be remembered for generations to come.
No it's  \p\phi = \frac{{1 + \sqrt{5}}}{2}\)  This is the formula for the golden ratio, which is approximately 1.618033988749895. It's an irrational number with interesting properties and is found in various natural phenomena and art

I love your animations
I really like the feeling of this kind of knowledge flowing through my mind without leaving any trace.

Is was e^iπ idk
1+1=2
I love math
@alanbecker,希望以后还能看到如此精彩的视频----原灵感作者：细节（电影：姜子牙）。我们明年再见。
HE JUST LITERALLY INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF MATHEMATICS IN A CREATIVE WAY
I showed this video to my match teacher and she loved it
bros the math multiverse god
hay otro haca de habla hispana
What has Happened
This is what im thinking about instead of doing actual math
Another example 50% 1000= 500
Example 100%  100=0
The Legendary Alan Becker is comeback with surprising animation just like he did when Animator vs Animation back in the day goes viral over bluetooth medium and 240pixel Nokia phone 😂
It’s amazona!!!

After seeing this video I became Newton
Nice
Nice video😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
† 😯 😈

More math pls
I can!
Alan becker is  hacker
is anybody gonna talk about how orange literally learned math in 14 minutes
These are the stages of my math class
E=mc²
That.  Was.  EPIC!  I especially like the glimpse of Aleph Null at the end.
Please make more animation vs. Math videos please! It was awesome and I learned something!
Sorry bro but ur gonna  have do die MASTER SPARK: STAGE 1000 11:04

this is very interesting I love it 🤩
As a mathatician I can confirm we can turn our equations into hand writen pistols

Много ли вы узнали об истории развития математики? Ничего!
Amazing! I only wish the other irrational numbers sqrt(2), etc showed weird behavior, like how e is growling and acting crazy.
I’ve learned more from this video than any of my math classes combined
This Impressive video shows that only 1 number is capable of destroying universes, dimensions and I congratulate Alan and the nerd 🤓    Esse impressionante vídeo amostra que apenas 1 número é capaz de destruir universos distorcer dimensões animadas e eu dou meus parabéns para o Alan e o nerd 🤓
if i was a teacher I'd do this to teach maths
I no I no ?????????
I watched this in math class and it was fun seeing the fight scene
The next Archimedes
math teacher vs students
He made a damn story out of MATH!!! I hate math and somehow this won me over.
History of the entire math, I guess
Imagine discovering i before you know what a circle is
Bro i have no clue what any of these concepts mean and its awesome
Moral lesson: you learn math to be strong and fight
Technical zero divided by anything should technic equal infinity, but if it could reach that mount a calculator would explode, so technically nothing can reach infinity because it has no start nor and so it’s just undefined which if we could reach infinity that would be incredible
Part 2🙋‍♀️
eipi
I would LOVE this as a game. The further you progress the more complicated the enemy is lol

Math lesson with Orange XD
This Guy Explained Why Supercell Makes Bad Updates

bro just played with maths for 14 minutes
Это самая лучшая анимация на канале
Superb
Yooo amazing 🤩
Mi favorite channel 😍
Bro, look here when they look at the college stuff and remind me, it’s Grade 10 change that it’s hard ones with numbers  % “ < > use those symbols next time
The fact That he could create life there just make this masterpiece rlly underleveled
I felt like I watched a show in 14 minutes.
i showed it to my maths teacher
1+1=2
Nem preciso mais ir na aula de matemática depois de ver esse vídeo
10+10=
Masterpiece
This taught math from k to 12th grade in 14 mins THATS CRAZY
일단 칼은 품질의 따라 다르다 멜프 칼은 아주 살살해도 뼈와 지방 살같은걸 통과한다 그러니 칼이 더 아프다 손가락이 있었으면 잘려 나갔을거다
🤣🤣🤣
0:01 why is he always sleeping?
Teacher: Why don't u understand anything!? and why don't u pay attention to math class!?  My brain while math class:
Now i want to learn higher mathematics.
The thumbnail = grade ukg question.... the video = maths college master
10+10=20😊
Anything divided by zero is zero and tehy're studying kindergarten
How to make math fun
1=1=2
Awesome!
Bro actually made math interesting. If my teachers used this to teach me math id be a math nerd too
bro taught us math in a fun way
i am dead
11:08 orange iq = ♾️😈
my God !!! I just saw what i had had learned from elementary school to collage, and beyond with in 14  min animation
3:42 what
Ingenious !
Beautiful video...Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.I had a huge smile on my face throught the video.This is golden. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK SIR.😊
Absolute good
What a Masterpiece!
Masterpiece!
I don't know math that much so i gonna ask.....WHAT IN THE F IS THAT MASSIVE THING AT THE LAST PART!!??😱😱
Did anyone see a big alef (hebrew) in the end? א?
by the way i now the math until 5:37
if you want to see a math video, here it is. nice video!
bro this aint one piece this math piece
F...k, what a DRAMA !!!
Math lore:
I miss terraria 😭 9:12
This gives me trying to understand tech in a lab to get out vibes
If only math class could be this exciting!!!
This is a masterpiece
3:20 he found the matrix
I like how orange just made a death star 11:00😂😂😂
TOTALLY captivating.
THIS IS PEAK ANIMATION 😭
1+1=Leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
The way you showed us א really explain its use in math being a very powerful symbol
I was watching this live when i was in the worst state of my life👁👄👁
w  alan becker is so cool to see it
Orange basically made a death star near the end
ending good
Alan make a sequence of animation vs math
This is beautiful! If I were a math teacher, I'd show this to my class to hype 'em up.
We often learn math like this 123+−×÷=%^ But imagine middle school 12+(66-6) 1,876<1,880 Last grade of middle π = 3.14 Me: pi is equal to 3.14159265358 High school √49 i becomes a thing in college √-1 i 2π = the full circle Unfortunately, its way harder at 11th to 15th grade We may encounter very weird things such as this ⋀ which is down side of > as it may not be weird 1+1≏?  As in, the younger side of infinity, ENCOUNTER THIS! ∝ And this is weird ik ≡ but is better than = Which i spent a whole ¾ doing this thing
WOW
Getting a op weapon in a game be like 9:29
I would pay trillions of dollars to play a game like that 8:34
A masterpiece 🔥
After seeing this, I decided to major in Mathematics.
it was amazing, I've never seen a video in this direction, I really liked it, I teach math so much and I really like it, but now it inspired me more than ever  thanks
????
1+1=2
oh match,i'm love match
I wish Euler could watch this
the end  is my favorite part
E^iπ E=2.7 (its very long) i=√-1=unknown π=3.14 (its very long)
i love how he makes a math gun
Little monster drops an i, TSC shoots 1 more i's.
did the orange guy die?
bro the e fr became a sigma at 7:35
Am I the only one wondering, or did this video make me want to take up mathematics?
Bro just blow my mind💀
Alan Becker know some math
Сегодня мой вечер будет заканчиваться с математики
good work
I was really bad at math. Now it all make sense!
My mind whole time: *Just use 1÷0 to make a machinegun*
Pow:matamatik sınavına girince hissettiğimiz
And this is why you don't mess with a math teacher They'd be obliterate y'all with his death unit circle (death star) while using the hammer of cos and isin  to power his =f(•) gun that turned into a massive satelite shooting death rays.
Ensinar matemática no ensino fundamental com isso é o suco de método Paulo Freire
Thank you for my math test answers
Bro applied for MIT Scholarship by making a YouTube video.
After math is funny
Sas
my calculator trying to help me out with whatever the fuckery of solutions i made up in my maths exams 💀
I can't believe that this is so accurate
Karena
100+100=200 1+13 =14 1+1=1 3+3=6
Is he smart now?
i laughed when it said (THE + END)
This is how Marvel should look like. Marvel movies are random ilogical sequences of "powers", and it always annoyed me. Tis world without rules. This has rules and more emotion.

Animation vs Music? Anyone🎵🎶🎛️🎧🎼?
This is the Coolest thing I have seen ...
Maths teacher dreams be like:
Nossa daqui a pouco o cara vai descobrir adeus da física ou Um novo elemento
8:43 turns out some of those Euler numbers grabbed theta and radii to modify the circle size so that its harder for TSC (Orange Stickman) to escape the plot circle. Especially when you see the plot circle growing larger a few seconds later.
How do you make VS animation with  what  applications??
!First Alan Backer!
the game starts 8:41
Ie?
bro took math to a whole new level
SO GOOD!
I wanna more like this because I like math please upload more like that
😮😮
Видимо он делал это анимацию пока его брат делал уроки😂😂😂( я не незнаю есть у него брат или нет если я задел Алана то извини🫥)
I wish my teacher teach me this way, it more fun
Where is the math teacher the math teacher
10;03 that ''yahhh'' got me dying and my friend💀💀💀💀
If someone saws a kid saying that the matemathics you can do it in the way you want, he's lying, cuz math it's a Exact Thing, it is what it is.
Bro who let him cook
I'm in a roadtrip but I'm  awake because my brother is sleeping and I can't because I'm in a small car and I love it because it's funny and it's guite and it's super goodddddddd❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't watch this at night its like a permanent flashbang trust me
This needs to be a game
???????????????????????????
Somehow achieved to make math look badass as hell. Good work
This was mind bobbling. Never seen something like this before.
Its weird to see greek letters at math and i though i only had those letters at school
I want different Endings in tsc takes math with him
Need more animation vs math 🥺
Thack you for the birthday present which is this video 🎉🎉
Can you please make a sequel for animation vs. math part 2/blue vs aleph?
Coulda use pi equation as gattling gun ammo, but everything can work.
=100
100-(1-1)
So this is what Richard was really playing on that one Gumball episode
Why does this make more sense then math class
11:10
10:58 “that’s no moon…”
I wonder if this will be a series like animation vs minecraft? If so, do you think he will be loved as much? Frankly, it would be great, this man is of good quality.
NEXT, MATRIX!!!!
Beauty of mathematic❤
Terkoiz, the Legend!
Hello may I ask what software this animated short film is made of？ thanks  a lot
凄ーい！ 途中から全然理解できないが 授業で習うより全然楽しい😀

I really want this to be an actual video game one day.
No pana esto esta a otro nivel:v 👍🏻 chido  👏🏻
Bro explained math with a fight
The first and last time I will ever like math

Wow, this was incredible! Edit: Might I say... moving as well? Somehow you managed to make us tear up at the departure of the "e".
Fight him fight
10:02 the fact that e didn’t scream e is really disappointing 😞
I Got My Teacher To Play This During Class (we watched the whole thing)
Reminds me how hard math is
Wait  2 3 2  Forms a bow if rotate the two You are creative
It's animation Vs Minecraft   Going to have have 100 episodes😎😎

If Maths would be like this, then everybody's favorite subject would be Maths😅
Your entire mathematics education summed up by an orange stick-man in 15 minutes.
YouTube没有弹幕，还是去B看吧
I don’t remember this from math class
I learned so much today thank you.
What a marvel it is, to see how far author came from old-old small sketchy cartoons)
i watched this in class it's pretty cool
Wow you really good at math😮
I lost my mind
This would be a much more engaging way to teach people math! Of course, we don't have that tech yet...                 or do we...?
How the hexk did we start with 1+1 and are now using sin graphs and equations to fight an intergalactic war....    Just like real math....😢
Imagine tsc is in battle and -1 just senses hes in danger so he makes a portal and they use math to confuse and attack the enemy
Cool
Alva majo biendo esto: 😳
Bro became smarter than Albert Einstein and somehow made a calculator cry.
the first video with no words that needs translation
This video is teaching us math ngl
17:39
50 x 0 = 0🎉🎉
Начало великого програмиста и математика
DIS DESERVES LIKE AND SUB
it takes humans like 20 years to learn everything about math and tsc over here learning and breaking mathematics in less than 15 minutes
10:15 a war of e
Shees you yalk Hebrew me too שלום
eiπ should be a character in Smash Bros
I did not understand any of this but it looks awesome
They should use this in schools
POWER OF MATH
Every time I see a fight scene I always say “the power of  MATH MOTHERF-“
Instead of grueling hours of homework they should just make kids watch this
Imagine being able yo learn math that quickly 😂
I can’t believe I learnt more math from this video than I have in the last 6 years of school
this was the coolest thing ive seen all day, I literally got goosebumps
Part 2?
Guys from all this time you have NOT notice that if you put on captions you see what they say okay😮😮😮
I just realized that the crew doesn’t know math!
Make a part 2 pls this was so good!
Are you using a calculator????
Eso es increíble esto es una película de razonamiento lógico
••iq
My math class when I blink:
Nono 1+1noses 2  1🍆1 = 3 😅
This is very confusing. All this math make my brain swell
La mejor animacion que has hecho. Grande!!!
taking "this video is sponsored by brilliant" to the next level.
There was a point in time where I understood 70% of this video. Now I understand it way less than that lol
This is absolutely fascinating. You have done a great work right there. Awesome
-0 ∞
i feel like he's teaching us how math works whilst fighting it deep inside my soul
fun fact the E in math is a number of pi
Im waiting for next part ❤🎉
Melhor animação de todos os tempos
This is me when I dont have internet so im messing with my calculator
mis compas cuando le tocan examen
This video actually helped me understand math a whole lot better!
11:06 you can hear VERY QUIET oof before the beam hits the grounds
It baffles me that a stick figure can have more intelligence than me.
DA NEVER ENDING 0 2:49
did y’all know 3x13=39
This is why I wish math was like this.
for those who dont know the math idiot is numberzilla
1 word ! perfect
By the way,at the end, the giant thing stomping aroundnis "Aleph Null"
Sala yeh maths bhe muje smaj nhe aye 😢
It's much better than any hollywood movie that came out in the last 5 years probably
The + End, Now make The - End
Bro dont even know 1+1= is💀
If only maths was fun
Bro teached us better than the math teacher
if i was a teacher i would play this video on the smart board lmao
Part 2 plssss
I didn't understand when people talk that math is beautiful, but now I know.
🔴
13:14 bro looked like choosen one
Bro looked like choosen one
If TSC can do this Then think about what Yellow do (Because Yellow is the smartest one I guess)
Has anyone realized that Aleph is in The + End?
Animation vs physics coming?
what was that in the background in the last few seconds? it kinda looked like a Hebrew letter

Pov: You decide to play with the calculator
OMG 🎉😂
Part two pleaseee

amazing!!!!
I didnt know that MATH can be this interesting to watch
A game where the better at mat you are the stronger you are *gasp*  THIS HAS GOTTA BE MADE INTO A JAPANESE ANIME!
雖然我不是數學家，但這看起來還很不錯吧
Make them Talk

Absolute masterclass
sooooo nice
Bro I learned math in fourteen min and 2 seconds
Eiπ
I was learning about pie and circumfrence
The perfect math movie
Wonderful
Now, Alen makes animations using math... this is madness...
Maths is impossible 😅
TSC: IS TIME FOR YOUR SURGERY E'cs: NAH HELP ME
This was so cool! I cried🥲
bro whats with the BIG N
Me realizing he's probably in the calculator app: 😳
Sick!
Amazing😮 One day I hope there will be a cinema film
GENIUS I LOVE IT !!!
Hay un error en el minuto 1:30
Was that giant symbol at the end a Hebrew letter, and is it actually used in math??
What happened to orange at the end?
did anyone come for mates mike?
next is windows vs animation
3:05 Exponents!
this is amazing, i feel like the visual representation would have helped me so much when learning math, and makes me want to learn more right now
e iπ
That should win an Oscar
I didn't understand the end
died from math
Just genuinely amazing
10:32  lil bro just casually created a death star 💀
Ah! Reminds me of the icons fighting on the windows desktop :D
Wth happened to orange?
Damn. This is probably the coolest math video I have ever seen.
🎉my brain and math class
you scared my brain
와씨 쥰내 재밌는데 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ 디테일이 미쳤네
Name of the guy?
Idk why but this is kinda beautiful and makes math way more fun for sure
That Infinity Laser was epic!
thanks to the video, i finally knew what squared means
Dude this vid learn us math lol!
You could make a fortune making these as actual tutorials. ❤
ahh imaginary numbers are fun... very fun and wacky
We need to see more videos like this.  This is just perfection.
This is what my brain sees when I do math in my head
L+rasheo
show this to your math teacher, She/he is going to cry
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT MATH. WHAT IS GOING ON
my mind when at school:
Is there animation vs math 2?
Bro got in the calculator
This sounds like a LEGO game.
Genuinely learned more here than in middle school Math classes
I love the idea of it and was shocked when orange started fighting math with math what an amazing video but i wonder how did he get there
Now imagine what will happen if he starts making video about physics
I like how the ÷0 tool actiually creates a printer of 0's since you cant use nothing to deal with a number because 0 is nothing and a number is bigger than 0,and how ÷0 doesnt convert the entire multiverse into an 5×99÷33<23%÷5×12%-2 or any more destructive abomination
Bro became the death star
Alan when will the next episode of Animation vs Animator 6 come?
I hate math.  But this was something 👍
He should've used ln() from the beginning it would have solved the issue straight away.
The smart kid's mind on a test:
:)
Can we have the second part please 🥺🥺
Its math????
BRUH BRO IT"S ALL SCHOLL IN 14 MINUTE BRO
MATH >:D 🤑💀🗿🤙   3:04 6 al cuadrado 🤑💀🤙
So much Meth
Reminds me of the math scene from the Astro Boy film. Beautifully done
good jajko ending🎉🎉
I want a part 2
Mack more videos like this
But still, I lost more brain cells the more I watched
Yea can you create a video game on math like this?
9:45 I thought it was -cos(pi)-isin(pi)
No wonder people are afraid of math. It's monstrous!  However, this was *very* nice!!
Es una de las mejores animaciones que he visto en mucho tiempo :'3
Finally, something with math in it i can call GOOD.😁
I’m a nerd and I love this 👌🦆
This is the coolest thing I've seen in a while
Orange stickman in this animation: call me artist😎.
11:05 literally the Death Star
I love how he goes from learning basic operations to university level maths
do all please
I wish that 500 comenta was not the limit
Hi Alan beck I’ve watched you sence I was 7 or 6
3:05 is some awesome arrays
Wait a minute, youre telling me orange literally broke math?
Before this animation : maths is boring, it's not even real , I hate maths   After this : I love maths only 🧠  Physics, maths are very beautiful subject, the problem is the representation .... if our teachers are started something like this , then students will actually fall in love with these subjects ❤❤ Nice 👍🏻👍🏻
This is why I'm scared of math
Not only is Alan a good stickman, but he's also smart and cool.
you are on another level, I loved this animation
the strongest harvard nerd:
how 1 number became alot of math thigs
That's right bro
How to find interest in math(math teachers suck)
Don't bring yellow there
What app did you use for the animation?
😮
Mathroom ☠️
I am completely baffled about the math involved, I only caught a little bit of it good lord
I love it when e^iπ pops out of -1. It's like a miracle that makes no sense but is perfect.
Math teachers should just send their students into a black pit with nothing but a number 1. That’s how they’ll learn
Woww one... 🫰🏽
Is that the Hebrew letter Alef at the end?
Does this video teach you about all math?🤔 or does it teach you something
I love this animation So addicting to me
Keren tapi aku ga paham math 😢
I literally learn more math every time I see this video and come back to see what I know. This is perfect.
conclusion, the only thing I learned 1+1= 3
i laughed so hard when TSC accidentally found euler's formula and e^(i*pi) returned
Stufent: we won't need these in are life  Teachers mind:
عندما يجتمع كلن من الذكاء و الجهد معان❤❤❤❤ أحببته😊
Man the sound design in this video is top notch
Someone should make a vr game based on this
Next - Animation Vs. Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning
Words cannot describe how cool this is to me now that I've finished maths A-Level
e^(iπ) stole beta and turned it to alpha
1+1=2
You Should Also bring Factorial 🗿
Alan becker makes it look like hes smarter then albert einsten
It was a bad idea to watch this while stoned.
Bro teaches me more than my math teacher 💀
I really like how this visualizes math
I send this to my friend.
e i cos n sin looks like a enemy but at the end he's a friend
Ladies and gentleman, it's with great pleasure that i announce with this video i reached to the conclusion THAT...  I am dumb
2
This made math so much more fun
7:50 After e^ipi shoots its first 21 terms into the Animation, e^ipi has lost most of its value, and cannot return its previous form without collecting all the value lost... 9:45 When the four e^ipi start synthetizing the monster, a term e^ipi turns into e^(-i^2 ln(1-i)), but it should be e^(-i^2 ln(-1))
amigo me gusta las matemáticas
Applied mathematics. Combat mathematics. XD
The what ...
Omg, that's crazy bro.
Wow
What is the giant 'N' at the end? I've been looking for a long time but I can't find it.

Честно говоря... Это охрененный ролик. Качество как всегда на высоте и хотелось бы повторения подобного. Очень захватывающе.
0MG!
I love how TSC learned math on his own without a book no teacher just pure IQ
10:01
This shows exactly how math is going from grade 1 to 13
If only my homework could be a cinematic battle with the letter e
How did TSC understand is so fast???
OHIO
Math is such an important subject to master. I love the logical aspect of it and always keep that in mind when educating students!
That video make me interest in maths
Super effective to incorporate math with animation especially for todays generation! @levelupmath6825
Ok I have GOT to learn all the concepts mentioned here!😂
the is Math to Number
I know 1% of this
E:1÷0 Tsc:wait... no,no,no!
3 month woah
Imagine if tsc discovered algebra
8:36  Codzombies be like
used this to study for a test and it worked
That video came to me as a calculus review from college like wow so long ago
turned into a whole calculator
You have got to do more videos
I need Animation vs. literature
its youuuuu
Actually surprised how complex math he can do considering his head is hollow
Smarter than my teacher
Smart
Someone needs to make this game
Go alan becker
Cool I love this animation
After I watched the video, I found myself very stupid 😂😂😂😂😂

When e uses the 1/4 to make a 8th of a circle it was like seeing a secret reference about a character only fans would be capable of noyicing
No mames yo nisiquiera podria hacer eso ibual prefiero tener clases de lenguaje que tener esto  Cuando el profe muestra todas las maneras de multiplicar,dividir y sumar xd.
Animation vs. Chemistry next please!
i love your animator

I literally know nothing about e to the iπ until i watched this video
😮
When did you fall off?
00:20 No lies its 11
As a 14-year-old teenager who doesn't know much about math, I can say that this video left me in the back at 6:52 and from there I didn't understand anything...
Whats the symbol in the end? The giant one?
You are my new favorite math teacher
πΩ∞
Bener bener njir Bossnya disiksa abis abisan☠️

Me atrapaste. Esto es cine
Фактически на 1:34 оранжевый уже дошел до 6 класса! По крайней мере у меня отрицательные числа появились именно в 6 классе.
Please, if there's a VR developer or sth like that rading this, *please turn this into a calculator*    answer this comment if you think you can do it, i have some ideas
This is so creative
🤞🫰🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
1+1+2
i just watched 14 minutes of a math animation. amazing
.
Now we will wait for "Animation vs Chemistry"!
😂😂😂
As terrible as I am on math I didn't understand anything I just know it was a masterpiece
13:33 WAIT IS THAT THE ZOOPHIL-
This video made my brain 314.314²+² times larger
Is e two
this video was VERY entertaining, and this is coming from someone who despises math so much i quit studying it entirely.
Very nice video!
Why math hard?!
13:47 Aleph starts to come
this is awesome!
δ ℵ eiπ φ

I hope this becomes a actual game so for example, credits for this idea to the person I forgor so what if you could just say like “stand on top of this number” and then divide it by 0 and then launch ur friend into the void
good math education
Dios que épico, acaba de revivir mí gusto por las matemáticas
Im here for the fight
Your a legend Alan were are happy to you😊
Epic so epic
Crazy to think there’s 13 years of schooling fit in 14 minutes
Mais la racine carré d'un nombre négatif n'existe pas.

I dunno why, but the tech-ish sounds, including the beeping and clicking is so damn satisfying to me
Alan, I need you in my math class
Math classes should show this to students

Wow ❤ I forgot everything for 15 minutes after watching this amazing animation really cool I love the developer of this animation ❤❤❤❤❤
This is epic

There are Marvel movies with worse plot and fight scenes than this💀
I study civil engineering and although we see basic mathematics for any engineering, I could never imagine how it can be seen in such creative ways. Many greetings ;D
I want to see this as an actual video game for some reason
“Math is nothing”  …but with Alan Becker is DIFFERENT
Hard
kgjhkl
Lets all appreciate TSC learning more math in 14 minutes than i did in my whole life (way more than 14 minutes)
Só não deu trabalho pra animar como tbm deu trabalho pra fazerem as contas e ter o resultado certo kkkkk
Amigo este video es buenísimo y super dinámico me encanta
wow.
Bro i swear Alan needs a Tv series

Demasiado buena
You are crazy i like your animation congratulation.
@derivando tendrías que explicar-lo que pasa en este video para entenderlo mejor
Господь, эпично до бесконечности, а вместе с музыкой - так вообще круче всяких блокбастеров! Потерялся сразу как только в на экране появились буквы, кроме Пи и пришлось посмотреть несколько разборов. Лучшее видео, что я смотрел за последнее время
bro, you get for me the imposible, now i have curiosity for math  You sir are AWESOME AND BEYOND
Es increíble!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Might be peak youtube animation
me playing Coocke Clicker
Music name? Plsss
Tsc is officially the smartest thing in the world
You should do Animation vs Music Theory next.
This shows really good iq feats from TSC
Yes it happened! IT REALLY HAPPENED!! FINALLY!!!  TSC did something i've been wanting to do since i was 7 *FIGHT MATH!!!!!!!*   YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
If this come's in exam😢😢😢😮😮,thanks for making this cool video for us
Combination of aesthetics and intelligence
Hello, alan becker
11:07
Thats why i love math and the fact you can do amazing stuff with it and felt proud that I understood almost everything in this video after 4 yrs of physics bachelor so it was kinda worth the struggle
The music really makes this short awesome
Wow
If math classes looked like this, everyone would love to learn calculus
Where oranges freinds at
It was amazing!
e ip cute❤
Bro this guy almost make my brain blew up💀💀💀
Absolut banger
No idea what the hell’s going on, but it’s mesmerizing as always
Me encantó cuando en el 1:40 deduje el número de Euler..!
Hey Orange does not like math  too 8:38
Next time someone does 🤓show them this vid
Wow Cool
Am I the only one that learned a thing or two?
So amazing
Bro really made me watch math and enjoy it better than all my math teachers combined
Imagine if someone made a game based off this, I feel I would learn much more about it.
Remember that all this started from 1
6:22
Lesson: Messing with numbers can break space time continuum, destroy entire universes… then create new universes 😮
That f=(.) Was insane!
Hello alan becker
Pls alan put the animation vs math p2 free pls
como sabes todo esto de mates?
few day ago I've watched this, and today first algebra lecture I had was about immaginary numbers
This alone made my applied mathematics degree worth it. I wish i could watch this for the first time all over again.
Masterpiece 👏
When i was studying math years ago, with my friends we came up with an idea of a computer game that would be something like this. That you would shape math landscape with all sorts of math actions from simple to absurd ones which would unlock as you progress further. But this is brilliant.
MAKING MATH FUN
God of math orange
I hate math but this is.... acceptable
I know everything. I can prove it. 1+1= 3
Did he just reveal time travel equation in the end😮!
1 + 1 = 2
This is one of the most amazing and clever things I have ever seen!
よくわからんけど作者は頭がいいってことはわかった

Buena pelicula
Me gusta mucho as mas de estimans este selular es de mi mama soy mellamo Mateo Robles Gomez 😊
Beautiful.
8^2 =64
this is amazing i only understand like 60 ish percent but that's such a cool way of visualizing math
Bro this orange guy is like so Genuse
This is @3@2i^9! (amazing)

This is awesome Alan! Beyond exceptional! Great work🤝
Is there anyone here who’s studied math for years, and understands how all of this works.
"This isn't even my final form!"
Coming back to this to re-watch it and just marvel at how all the math actually works for the bullets, swords, whatever's going on. It baffles the mind and pleasures the eyes... it's a perfect animation.
If you could turn this format into a video game, you'd have an incredibly powerful tool to teach kids math.
What was the giant shadow that walks off at the end
"How it feels to learn math" the animation :Ü™
My logic: 1+1=11 2+2=22...
Help my brain is dying of mathema-
o melhor jeito de aprender matemática
background song title from 0:13 to 1:35 ??
Imagine schools used this video for M A T H
so what happens at the end? I could sort of follow till they become friends, after that no idea what's happening. Any hints?
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The day they touch upon Quantum Physics and such Alan's computer would literally complain to him
1:40 "Well, that escalated quickly!"
this is one of the most epic animations I've ever seen. Kudos to the team!
Majestic work! Incredible quality.
This video had no right to be that epic!!!
A mathterpiece of animation.
MATH IS THE POWER
(-1 ) = peace e^iπ = war (just because it has ego now) otherwise it's same
Too good
❤
Seriously amazing.
Math is just telling us how the universe works all the way to 1 + 1 = 2 to e = mc square either way it’s confusing and I don’t like it
.o.
This is truly a masterpiece. And I would also like to add my praise for the incredible sound design!!! Great work!
That looks like a Sun Wukong Math in 10:05
Imagine what would’ve happened if he did 0/0
Thank you so very much for this, I always loved math with its complexities but also how there are an infinite amount of possibilities/solution for every equation. I also love and thank you for not just throwing in numbers and calling it math but how you used all the numbers correctly forming the actual equations that they equaled up to like the decimal and how it basically created it’s own space in the circle with all the additions such as each individual measurement. Truly a spectacular sight to see.
music name pls
i would watch the whole series
We need a sequel, so many more areas of maths with such cool concepts to be explored here: Linear algebra, calculus, probability, perhaps non euclidean geometry or something totally wild like modular forms
Good animation
0:42
0:01
This is my favorite Alan Becker video of all time
now i wanna see "Animation vs Words" where the whole thing turns into a weird amalgamation of Scribblenauts and BaBa is You
I've learned more about mathematics in this video than in my last years in school. That's mind boggling. Thanks!
ayudaaaaaa mi cerebelo
This is the sickest thing I've seen on YouTube in a VERY long time.
A matemática nunca mais foi a mesma.
the e's combine to become....bom bom bom bom bom bom....MEGA MATH
I'm just blown away, incredible work !
now I need to see this done with English.
This is perfect!
Wow just wow
I'm scared of math so this was like a horror movie for me
GE-NI-AL
Terraria be like:
Thanks
Is there a Fields Medal for animation? I would like to propose this masterpiece.
Here’s a comment no one will see purely for algorithmic purposes
Man I watched it about 10 times, it's still so good
Yooo idc submit this to the Oscars
No idea what any of this means but so good
messi
2_m=cy7
wish school never ended
Marvel has been really quiet since this dropped.
This was awesome!!
My brain hurts.
Absolutely delightful! This is far deeper than just presenting math in an entertaining way. This video has the power to wake up the potential in a 5-year old kid that is going to be the next Einstein.
At 7:09, that spiral look exactly like how our solar system moves in the galaxy :) I love it :)
S se fã Ss vdd
lol I adore א just hangin out there all gigantic and part of the world's background
It is BEAUTIFUL
wau
bro my teacher sent me in my WhatsApp group ❤
i love it
So good. I'm gonna show it to my students!
1:44
So.... you need to be some kind of math nerd to get this one I am guessing? ><
I knew like the first 10 minutes of it and ten I was like ok im done lol
Richard Watterson playing calculator hard mode
on a side note, being a sound designer for games, I'm going to use this as a reference showcasing how animation and sound design render an experience cool, not the underlying graphics
I reckon this is gonna be really helpful in getting kids interested in learning maths at school. Like, I wish I'd had something like this when I was growing up (and it was funny, because I grew up in the golden age of internet stick figure animation) because it would've made me so much more interested to learn how all of these equations work.
Just stunning, absolutely stunning
11:06 is literally just "the sun is a deadly laser"
This video will outlive us all.
This is great!
he really put the e in math
this animation has taught me more math than my math teacher could ever dream to teach me
Thank you!
This needs to be SERIOUSLY applied to the most prestigious MATH, EDUCATION, ANIMATION awards!!!!
I love how our math teacher showed us this video at school😭 its so amazing
I wish i knew trigonometry and other high degree math stuff
Bro said "I know how to do math." In 6738 different languages
Pls music pls pls pls pls pls pls pls pls plssssssssssss
BRO TESTED MY EVERY SINGLE BRAIN CELL 😂😂
Outstanding!
this gives me vietnam flashbacks of school
PoV: Richard playing the caculator game
Bro Iam Only 6class
Wow
i understood 2+2, dont ask me any question for the other parts.
Aleph at the end is thrilling
This Animation Short should be sent to the oscars. It will 100% win.
Hello guys
I don't like math but after this animation I like it a little 😅
wonderful
Im gonna learn math from this video
It's so beautiful 🥲🥲🥲😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
hi
I can finally beat my teacher
the big one of x gives me a little off it's like that symbol don't belong on the family which is the left over damaged from the universe will eventually applied on both side so the last part of everything would be the transparent as the combination of black and white that let's to transparency in many different soured, than it should be 2white and 2black = 4 + 1 = 5 as the proper formal of the number and shape that should be 12 overall. bruh the 1 is where that thing came from again...
Teacher does a 200 1 hour lessons on maths alan becker make a 40 min animation that explains everything but better
"we cant draw a perfect circle" orange (second i think) making a perfect circle in just a dot:
I loved math before this video
Please make one for chemistry
When you think it´s going to be another cool video and you get something that is better then every film I´ve ever seen
Damn Alan Becker you did the dopest animation I ever seen in my life good and great job🎉🎉🎉
Love how when bro got the infinity bullet his gun knew no limit
I love math
Bro is learning math better than me

Hey what a good thing!!!
First you turn math into magic, then you make it sn antagonist, then you make it a WMD, then you make it evil, then you turn it onto the power of gods 💀👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾  Now i really wanna learn more about math 😭

@AlanBecker Can you add voices
11:18
Grade 12 math be like:
f u going full circle sooo good dont ever stop
E= mc²
∞ Σ n=0  so funny has a unlimited
the title should be:HOW TO DEFEAT MATH
yes
A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
How did TSC even went to the math dimension?
I have no clue what any of those math symbols are yet I still knew exactly what they meant throughout that whole thing
part 2?
What
Bro is playing with math now
Animation often involves a creative and artistic process, while math provides the underlying principles for aspects like motion, physics, and geometry in animation. Math is the backbone that enables realistic movement, lighting, and visual effects in animated scenes.
ⁿ⁰
this is actually cool
ORANGE IS REALLY LEARNING      ME:UM  WHERES THE DECIMAL POINTS???
Bro you know how more fun a exciting math would be if it was like this
Hello, I celebrate your short movie and love your score. Thank you very much. It could be a little bit strange, but: do you think about an - end as well, perhaps within topologies as a sequel? I would be happy to see this explorer again - and its friends…. 😊
The death egg making a appearance in math. 10:37 AND ITS EVEN BIGGER.11:07 HOW IS E STILL ALIVE!!!
this was me chasing math probloms in 6th grade math
1/0=undefined not infinity, it goes to negative and positive infinity at the same time.
Only if he could use it in a battle
10:01 мегатрон!
Когда знания в метематике хоть как-то помогли .
bro make's a death star :0
Qerwhai
do animation vs school
Its funny, when the zeros kept falling, it was as if they were going up and down infinitely. 2:50
terraria 1.5 the math update
Couldnt see it😢
Who helps him increasing the ratio of the circle? at 8:51
POV in my brain
Its like animation vs math and si science and 1989 61978
This man deserves an oscar for his math

La mejor animación de matemáticas que eh visto Es increíble los detalles matemáticos que tiene, es simplemente  MAJESTUOSO ❤
Making this an animation a video of the figure being obliderated by numbers and equations would've been more accurate lmao. Good video regardless
Aint no way he clapped math like THAT.
6÷0=undefined
Animated Symbols!?!?
Absolute genius 🔥 A real gem💎
How teacher explain math be like:
He doesnt need pixar, pixar need him
Wow, I've never really seen anything beautiful...❤❤❤
đỉnh quá
Bản bác quái😂
My brain error
Matemática é tudo  Como eu imagino:
who could've known math could be made so interesting

this helped with my adhd
i like maths
Did anyone else notice that at 7:26 he added them to become cos i sin

When me study math belike :
I love All your videos Alan! Keep it up!
how am i learning math from this
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
sooooooooo math
wow amazing
Ultimate math fight
Amazing
Literally so good. The way he meets e^iπ and e^iπ disappears by multiplying itself by i and then he again starts to search about the clue of e^iπ and finds the way of maths.  And the division 6 = 6/2 gives 3 after we do minus 2 three times is implemented in such a good way.  The way he goes from 1=1 to gamma function and others equations pretty much says all maths are connected.  I was personally impressed by the way he showed the power of 4. When we write 4^2 we get 4 rows of 1 and 4 Columns of 1 and that's 16.  Similarly when we add 1 in the power of 4 which already had power 2, we see that we now go to the cubical part (z axis) so there will be extra 1 rows or columns in z axis (Sorry i cannot explain in English words because English is my second language but i know it in paper haha)  Similarly when we add one more 1 then we see that each row and columns have their own rows and columns. This was so good. Thank you for creating it. If i am wrong please correct me in reply. Thank you.
Hi
The pluses are offset (slightly higher) in the beginning
1+1+2🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
the e and the orange stickman had some deep meanings lol good animation to
Wow 😅🎉🎉
감사합니다.
I love the battle!
TSC vs Math!
wow
Playing with math
what i learned is  Learn math from schools❌ learn math from youtube✅
we took 12 years to learn math but tsc just learn it in 12 minutes
رائع جدا ❤
I lost you at √-1 = i
Круто😃😃😃
Incredibly, the ratio of views to likes is minimal.
All of this to prove eiπ=−1
I cab my number -e=2×r to ifinity do you  see away for theta
animation  vs  English
π=phi
Tomorrow is my math test thanks 👍😂
Hola
Bgm name please
This is very knowledgable maths. I wish I could do maths like that.
Oh my God. It's so interesting
11:27 MAC OS DIMENSIONS !!!
Bravo 🎉
Alan is just theching us math
This video deserves aleph likes.
The title should be the The trip from integer numbers  to complex numbers via Euler's formula then to the Riemann sphere, which is the complex numbers with infinity
1+1
Alan Becker's Animation vs. Math videos are a series of animated works that incorporate mathematical. concepts for entertainment and are designed to help you learn about mathematical topics while having fun.  This series explains mathematical ideas and concepts by incorporating them into characters and stories, including Euler's formula.   Euler's formula is a very important mathematical formula for complex numbers and exponential functions, and it shows a seemingly complex relationship.  Connecting this formula to enemy characters and presenting it as an animated story is an interesting way to introduce mathematical concepts to viewers.   The Animation vs. Math series promotes having fun while learning math and incorporates a variety of mathematical ideas to demonstrate the importance of math.  The appearance of Euler's formula as an enemy character adds an element of exploring the world of mathematics in animation, and may provide viewers with an enjoyable learning experience.
Mathematics be like: bro this easy as 1 +1, the question: 2837 x21
❤❤❤
And I thought I’d never use math
just he the one that make math interesting
This video... Is accurate. it's truly, truly, accurate to math. Thank you.
eiπ funny (fun fact: ∞ isnt a number)
fun fact: pi times 2 is tau
sxe ko bạn
And the question that doesn't let me sleep is: How do orange get to that place?
Hi
I've seen this one to many times. and I will admit, it is really good, the music building it up, the sound effects. MAN, it would have been cool if i learned math this way.
Breaking math even though u alreddy broek pysics....
This background sound....
Welp, at 11:09 my computer crashed and not gonna lie, I though it was part of the video. With how complicated some of the formulas were, and knowing some of your work, I could've believed it. I cant believe it crashed at such an amazing point though, that was a hilarious coincedense.
Bring part 2!🧋
8:29
And of course there has to be an epic fight😅
Just astonishing, superb! Thank you!
É possível se 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Mathematics hear my power and you will tremble I imagine how the aliens will understand our mathematics😅😂

Hi alan
It is a masterpiece!
Tomorrow is my math test
Can you make animations including quantum physics?
Beautifully Animated.❤
Imagine if I will be in this world. I would be obsessed.
....wow ... My brain burn out XD
I just ended a calculous class in the colege and finaly i can understand this video. Its Big brain time.
Lost me as soon as it brought letters in. 😅 Just like school!
1+1=3
😮 There are a few characters that I don't know if they are earth characters or not
When you sleep at nath class be like:
👁🕳👁
No se inglés 😂
I still don’t know if this is part of AVA how did orange get there how it’s not on the playlist or I he saving it
I was very sad when the orange character left, if I was in the world of mathematics I wouldn't want to leave there😭
e^i
what happen to tan
My autistic son is one of your biggest fans. I would love to buy something autographed if you ever offer that!
I was waiting for the e=mc power 2
cuenta en decadencia
We need a part 2 where it’s longer and there’s a massive war
I’m in 4 grade I know a small bit of this
this doing numbers
🎉🎉🎉🎉
I kinda want this to be a Vr Game
Wow what program you use?
Greatest animation I’ve ever seen🤩🤩🤩
0:36 can we talk about this frame?
damn it would be really cool if there was an "animation vs undertale"
This animation made math look cool lol
as an asian i find this quite my daily basis funny
These animations are AMAZING!
Plzzz make more
When do y’all stop understanding? For me it’s 9:38
Alan just taught me knew lessons that I don't know yet and I already understand thanks Alan❤❤😮
So now I’m waiting for Animation vs Physics video 🙃
2²
The winner was blue
studying for a math degree finally paid off!!
II×II
Amazing, I've never seen anything like this👍👍
You taught math better than any of my school teachers!
The only time when someone can say maths is fun and actually mean it
calculator in 2096:
I don't know math, all I know is this video needs an Oscar
My things at school:
No matter how many times I watch this I’m still so confused-
I wish one day I can learn enough math to understand this masterpiece
What the math teacher expects us to do at 8 in the morning:
Cute 😊
bro just has beef with the letter E
Alan Becker really studied for this animation.
crazy...
just amazing
)$$($)$/2!$}#-------------------------------🔥❤️❤️‍🔥
Bro become a mathpid guy
Very clever video!
Wait a sec square root - 1 equals I
Is that - 1 million thousand + 256000 + 1 million
How is he calculating that fast
Oh after 64 it's 16 and then eat
1024 256 64 32 16 8 2
How can the stickman do that
It's like a calculator
Now it's-3
What the
I can't believe it goes into the negative now it's-1
Math teacher: The test is not that hard  The test:
Wait Stickman has the ability to take-away numbers
Now it's 100 equals 100
Wait now it's 1 + 99 equals 100
Wait a second did 40 appear by sitting
Why is Stickman multiplying all the OnePlus One + 2 + 2 + 20 + 20 to make 100
The meme
Это видео -- лучший популизатор математики
I'll be honest, I hate math. I can't wrap my head around all the functions, equations, and imaginary numbers like -0. But for some reason, I find myself fascinated by this video to the point where I've been watching it over, and over, and over for 3 months now. As well as watching Mathematicians break it down.  This video is a marvel of our time with it's learning, animation, entertainment factor, and pure genius.  A long time fan I have been for Alan Becker. He's touched my childhood, my heart, my mind, and now; He's touched my inspiration.  Edit: I now understand Imaginary Numbers. =D Edit 2: There are now multiple explanations for -0 in the replies. I'm confused again.
*Richard jugando a la calculadora(nivel fácil)*
Alan becker the goat
"The test is not going to be hard"  The test:
I hope this is in the update
Nahhh this guy is gifted and there's no two ways about it
i×i is -1, -1×i is -i, -i×i is 1 and 1×i is i and so on...
If this episode starred Yellow instead of TSC they would have gotten out in 30 seconds
Were is continuum therom?

Me gustaría unirme al canal pero apenas tengo 10 años y porque no puedo crear videos
I wish math was this fun in school😅
part two perhaps?
the Formula IS RIGHT!👏👏👏👏
i would actually play this

The moment you realise, all you learned at university was needed to understand this movie
Сделай стикменом ты и озвучку так будет понятнее что они там говорят и какие у них эмоции и куда смотрят
Animation Vs  Math (Official)
Math lore just dropped
What!?
He just explained all math in history
what math teachers expect from us:
After seeing this every body should know what  Pie is made of in math
This needs a part 2. This is amazing.
Who knew Terkoiz was such a big math nerd
Pov: playing a new game and you are learning too much and your pro friend tries to stop you
Me in my math test:
amazing！
9²=9×9=81
Officially the coolest video I’ve ever seen
This was Bone-chilling, i hope its not to much to ask but there needs to be a sequel, the animation and sound design was out of this world!
i dont understand most of it,but doesnt matter: its still perfect.       Note: i would have included a math pun if i was any smarter at maths
school from pre-kindergarten to 12th grade:
math lore
😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
If this was a videogame i would be excited for the first boss (Euler) Edit: The attacks for the base form and the second form (shown in 7:35 and more) would be insane. The third phase would be against an onslaught of duplicates as seen in 8:48. Overall, this has great videogame opportunity. The way the f-model-shooter turns into an absolutely overpowered variant as seen in 9:29 from one of the doubles in its second form is a bit unfair, but thats okay since the 4th phase at 10:01 is incredibly well-written and it is immune to it, forcing you to do actual damage. But on your second playthrough, if you look closely enough, you unlock a one-time use that basically insta-skips the 4th phase. Doing so unlocks a secret 5th phase where you have to carry e and escape from the imaginary realm. I would say that this is a beautiful first boss, but the op weapons you can unlock for this exist, so that bumps it down from 9/10 to 7/10. Still better than those mobile game bosses
WERE MAKING OUT OF MATH CLASS THIS EVERYONE
I really agree with the final action. That arrogant villager simply does not deserve anything. He all he did was eating.
Math teacher: math is funnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!! Students:no way it's boring Math teacher's brain be like:
Find the X and Y intercepts for: 3x + 4y = 12 Y-Int Sub x = 0  3x + 4y = 12 3(0) + 4y = 12 4y = 12 4,      4 Y = 3 or (0.3)  X-Int sub y = 0 3x  + 4(0) = 12 3x=12 X = 4 or (4,0)
SALUDOS DESDE PERÚ I LOVE MATHS
Is that ALEPHNZERO
Yo
With this video we will be smart in mathematics
this makes math sound fun lol
I would know enough math to appreciate 100% this masterpiece.
Imagine if TREE was here
He teached us all of the things in 14 mins but we learning in 8 years lol
Oh can you do a part two
Euler just became a Mech
This video explain math in an way that nobody ever explained in one cool animation Great job Alan Becker 👍
guys, i don't understand the video. i lost track after they included some weird symbols like a shortened t and a the weird two lines things, cant be me right? like what is a 1+1=2?
2+2=5?
E=mc2
math is toooo complicated
What game?
Ep 2 plsssss
You mean to tell me I could have learnt 13 years of maths in 13 minutes like Orange?
i show this viedo to maths teacher and maths scolar 😤😤
Masterpiece
Ay at 5:23 I said "It Can't get more Advanced Right?" But I was Wrong, it got so Advanced that my brain Couldn't Keep up.
Plot twist: SC was actually still in Alan’s pc but was in a calculator app
I wanna part 2. Some kind of context of how he got there, or some continuation of these characters
if we could find an energy amount equal to 6 divided by 0 that would mean no more energy problems
This is the coolest video I’ve ever seen
Every math teacher got beat by a guy who makes stickman videos
I would have this man do the UX design on ALL websites and apps
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
this hurts my brain
I Iike math
¡OH MY BRAIN!
Bang jangan lupain aku ya bang😢😢
Thanks to this video... I did the homework.  I now know how to demonstrate that the derivative of e^x is... e^x.  taught myself taylor expansion and the limit laws and some logarithm laws to be able to do it.
ok
increible 🤯
“Math is NOT a game!”                       -Infamous last words of everyone’s math teacher
oi alan sou muito seu fa

what in the absolute f🤓ck is going on
As a mathematician, Wow!
Wooooooooow
I could watch SC mess around with math functions all day
Jeez tsc that’s a little over bored don’t you think 10:33
Hello
calculator the videogame
This will be forever the most amazing animation and fhe music is creppy for some reason
Omg son problemas matemáticos
0:01 hello timed
This could have taught me that fractions are basically division problems wayyy faster than my 5th grade teacher ever could have
I can see this turning into a series, Animation vs STEM.  Science could be chemistry and biology simulation.  Technology would be coding and the code behind the Fighting Stick Figures, as well as making his own computer with no knowledge.  Engineering would be physics. Just… physics.  And math is done.
Bro so good animation keep it up
Это круто
who needs school use avm ( i just realized that avm also stands for animation vs math not just vs minecraft)
"basic math"
If you have not yet you should make a animation of the stick men discovering art and the eraser is trying to erase them and they have to paint them selfs to hide from the eraser oh and one of the gets erased and the friends have to draw him back :) let me know if you will do it or not. Thx for reading this.
Math might be do complicated that even the smartest person can’t solve it
Egor's sound effects are amazing, and Terkoiz is a genius.
Hi madeha!
Senhor alam  faz um episódio de animation vs Benddy and ink machine
Everything past the one minute mark is made up, numbers dont go past 100
Next up: animation versus the infinite void of the cosmos, and the concept of time itself.
My brain in every math exam :
Awesome 😍❣ Love it
This is brilliant and horrifying to realize how much I still have to learn

When Euler's identity lunges at The Second Coming, he puts a negative sign on himself, effectively teleporting him to the opposite side of the circle. Euler's identity gets mad, so they evolve and start shooting math rockets at The Second Coming again. He sees the point on the side of the radius. The Second Coming then grabs a part of the circle and multiplies it by 4, so he can reach the point. He then grabs it off and strikes it with the "sin hammer". This makes a beam that knocks Euler's identity out of the circle. Euler's identity then devolves and turns into cos(π) + isin(π), which then transforms into eiπ+ e-iπ/2 + eiπ- e-iπ/2i, which clones Euler's identity by 4. These Euler’s identities devolve into cos(π) and then proceeds to multiply into four again, making sixteen of Euler’s identities. It can be further assumed that these Euler’s identities did this process many more times to make a massive hoard of them. While this process is happening The Second Coming puts a nine, x(multiplication symbol), and a nine onto the equals making =9x1.

Incredible idea! and the expressions of "e". Couldn't imagine one can make the 'e' work out like that.
I’m In 5th and math Is my favorite Subject
Domanda da ignorante. Alla battaglia finale, aumentando la radiale non dovrebbe fare una parabola infinità? Perché torna indietro? 9:00 in poi. Grazie

bro if they added guns to math i would quit school
how fun teachers teach:
amazingggg
Bro thats catch me off nerd
The aleph at the end was perfect detail😂
Masterpiece
1 + 1 = 3
Watch this smooth masterpiece 3:29 .. brooo 😍👏👏
Bro. He made a Death Beam out of a Math Problem! Why can't math be this fun in real life!
Legends watching this in 2x 😂
I play this video in my maths class on smart board with my teachers permission .. and then the class gone crazy 💕😍 ...
Respect to the Animator 💕
OK, 2 THINGS  1-you are a mathe freaking genius 2-OMG THIS IS KKREAZY
you create a game pls your animations so cool and so good you create game pls but not pay
my mind is blowing but it's fine
Pure Approval is deserved.
すげえ
Average student: “Ugh, math is so boring!” Math professor: “Look, I’m trying here! I’m sorry if I can’t make math look like an action sequence from a Marvel movie or…whatever video games you kids are playing nowadays!” Alan Becker: “Hold my beer…”
HEBAT

I wish math was like this
Awesome
Why is e the bad guy i dont understand can someone explain please?

That video is awesome and good I Love it
Genius man
9:44
This is a good way to teach maths
Yo en mi momento más esquizofrénico en la hora de matemática
Imagine alan somehow finds the answer to the hardest math equation known to man by just making this animation
e^iπ be wilding af
How wonderful how!!
SUBLIME
The only math related stuff that i likes
This is why I love Alan Beckers videos
the fact how this also teaches me
Mathilicious..
and people said math couldn't be cool
bruh if I had this while in high school I'd be a math Specialised student XD
𝒷㋍e𝓇 ㍴𝓃𝔢𝐲
guys i got | 𝓮ⁱ𝝅 | trapped in these walls >:]
bro can make us learn math in 1 vid💀💀
Bob
I think there is an error at 4:22, as e^(iπ - π) is not e⁰, it is -e^(-π)
can't stop watching this video again and again
*I❤MATH*
Alan Becker is a genius
Gamma function!
saddest story ever

No cap, the begining music sounds like oppinhemer trailer song
wow. genius. pure genius.
Yo the fight was matching up with the song I listened to
11:06 blud said "Adios amigos!" 💀
He learned all of this in 14 Minutes
I know multiplication and division now!
good fight scenes and romance 10/10

Ramaiya vastavaiya
the only time i would be interested in maths. aawesome video
Beautiful.
Did my guy fall into the calculator app?
This video almost made me look like Albert Einstein.
As a mathematics teacher, I always dream of explaining math concepts in an interesting and amazing way. Let me say, you have done wonderful work in this regard, even though words are not enough to express my feelings. In my review/reaction video (animation vs math in Urdu Hindi), I tried to explain this masterpiece in Urdu/Hindi for roughly 1 billion people in Pakistan and India!
1 + 1    ?
Math
There needs to be a game like Little Alchemy but it's this and you combine and split numbers and concepts to get new concepts like little alchemy
CAN WE PLEASE DO ONE ABOUT Science 😂❤
I like that is
Can’t believe this made math so popular they added it to real life
me studying
Why does this make me learn more about math than school
9:59
10:00 i think its infinity
Congratulations Alan. You actually found a way to make math fun. Another masterpiece.
1+1=2

❤❤❤❤❤❤
this was a headach lol
Making it spell "exit" is so genius i had to rewatch 3 times to catch it
I'm literally a child and I didn't imagine this about mathematics...
你知道你这个视频在中国火了吗？
Bro explained entire maths in a 14 minute video
Plz Can somebody tell me music 🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶🎶 ??????
Nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Me when im bored in math:
🎉🎉🎉wow
Exam be like:
pov: if 9th grade actualy existed
I am starting to love math now 😂
I'm eating🍝
Let's prove that this video is educational.
Wow e il cugino di mr stecchino
did bro just make a math question of teleportation ???
We Need Animation vs. Physics now.
Really good video
3:36
Hello!
As someone who goes to college and does math, I can confirm this is how stick men would react to math
what 3:08
Me watching this video but don’t understand anything:  Cool video! I like it : D
9:46 mathatron (construction)
2:52 why did scary music played
Maybe if I studied math harder in the past, I would understand the context of the calculations in this war.  For now, when I watch this video I just enjoy the excitement of the war, but don't understand the context lol 😂
I would pay for a VR game like this
People who dont know: 😃  People who know: 🧮🛐😔📐
Maths seems a bit boring but the animation made it fantastic, need more videos
I want a game about this ngl
How math teachers teach:  The class: How the fu-
math teachers heaven
why is alan becker the only person that can make math fun
13:10
0:11 POV: Orange becoming a nerd to escape the random prison in ava 6
Once the numbers and equations got really complex, I just couldn't go any further with math. Awesome video, the complexity of the topic was so well executed.
Bit late for this but he could of gotten 2 infinite signs, used one one the gun and one on the radius so everything gets shot.
I mean, this is basically what math feels like. A video game style battle for the power to escape the calculator.
This is absolutely stunning and an outstanding masterpiece
VOY A ESTAR A LA ESPERAR DE OTRA ANIMACION ES LA MEJOR QUE PUDE VER. GRCIAS POR EL CONTENIDO.
math gameplay vs math lore
Can't wait for Animation vs. Theoretical Physics
1+1=2
This feels like the math class version of watching ‘the history of everything ever’ in history class
This animation went from toddlers' math to star calculus war, transformnerds, avengers of the mathematics endgame and into the mathiverse.
56,347th
Next video: Animation vs Alphabet
Gotta appreciate how Alan is able to turn these VS episodes into basically the definition of a anime final fight pretty much. Like, it's SO intense. Raises the heart-rate just by watching it. Incredible stuff honestly.
You're Awesome Mathematician!!
خخخخ
I feel like god when actually understand 60% of this video
Imagine Animation vs Science for the next part. Like Each Branch like Biology, Chemistry, and Physics being the hardest.
HOW IS ORENGE DOING THIS THIS IS THE COOLIST THIN IVE SEEN IN MY LIFE
I LIIIIIIIKE IT!!! THIS MATH IS BLOWING MY MIND!!🤯🤯📖📖💙🧡🤍🖤🩶❤️
CONGRATULATIONS ALAN you have reached 1Milion likes!
ako na nandito sa grade 10 level HAHAHA
We want animation vs organic chemistry
Next up:animation vs science
The exponents are true! If you didn’t know, 6 to the 2nd power is 6 x 6. 4 to the 2nd power is 8. It multiplies the number by the number before the small number 6 x 6 x 6 is 6 to the third power

So cool it would be funny to se orange Vs chemistry now
i like math
I think I could watch this for another 6 hours
Some collage math teacher got the chills watching this and knowing what it all means
That's so great
POV: How teachers expect how math will help us in life
I want to see what history would be like if this is math
Good I’m 🇻🇳

Bro taught me math better than school
I love the ending teasing at differential equations.
If only math was like this oh and try using r=infinity

entedi foi nada do meio pro final mas gostei  😀
bro has blew my mind up on 1 video
I couldnt stop watching❤this video is just amazing!
The new Albert Einstein XD
This is so beautiful. Perfect visualization of mathematics... You guys did an awesome job!

Bro just made another masterpiece 😮 He literally educate and made an action cartoon at the same time... Literally blow my mind...
El hermano cada vez se supera a si mismo 😮
how do you edit like that? It's really cool
this is real cool edit for math.
wow. this is art!
math
In this animation we see if orange can be nerd...
dude this is just so creative... watched an alan backer video after a long while and it doesn't disappoint
wow, math IS fun
Imagine if there was for biology geography, science, or different ones. That could be so cool
How to make math interesting
Animation vs Astronomy gon be lit 😅
i am brain dead lol

This is going to heaven for yellow
Man, this is trully incredible.
This is so cool! Even tho i didn't understand anything

good job
i learned so much to day
the sounds are amazing🔥
mi mamá: ¿por qué no entiendes las matematicas si es bien facil? yo viendo como sale todo eso de una simple suma de 1 + 1:
guys my head explodes from too much math🤪🤪
Bro learned math faster than i can read

It all starts with one.
Why did this actually teach me a bit of math 🙂
More like this one, please🤩
This video hurts my brain
SIMPLY PERFECT
MATH GOD😮
Me 1st time watching: "Dude I know so little..." Me after seeing numerous reaction videos on youtube:" Only 2 people understands this better than me"   I think this happened to you guys as well XD
I wish i could understand math this easy
This is baldis favourite video
Tbh helped me learn math better than school ever did

Jaja y yo acá suscribiendo me x una amiga que lo compartió 30 minutos y todavía nosé ni que veo jaja 😎🤔😂
Espero que un dia se vuelvan ver
If he can multiply his running speed why wouldn't he just multiply it by infinity since he figured how to attain that
Wow you are so good at mathematics
I'm sure i would enjoy this more if i knew anything bout math 😅
Absolutly INTERNATIONAL Language
How did orange end up here
yo en mi viage  astral en plena clase de matematicas
I love how aleph is just giant
The punch at the end was personal
magic isnt real, math explains it all. love it
bro just make math's fun fr
Who says that math is not fun?
Thats why I adore math♥️✨  Thanks Alan
That first part where TSC hit the dot with cos and sin felt like an ULTRAKILL parry.
hi

Must be appreciated,  keep  doing it 😊😊
Its cool to see math visualized like this

With this video the math is ez
I convinced my math teacher to show this video to the class and I think it's safe to say 45% of students didn't know what the heck was going on
literally the bes animation of all time
Wait, so during the truce segment was Orange guy asking for a way to escape from the math dimension, like to get back home? Is that why he spelled out “EXIT”?  The first time I watched I was confused and thought the Euler Number betrayed him—the end. I was like “what??”
e I'm  Orange
God moring 15:51 hous
Broh I found this video on the 17th of August n I've been watching it once or twice everyday since 👌🔥🔥💯

As a physics student and a math´s lover, that was just amazing, goosebumps!!! 👏congratulations Alan!!! ❤
This is the only way to make math fun .
"How much of this math do you know?". well i know + - x %. i also know what pi is "(+more but forgot the names for them)" but cant do the math with it though. so my knowledge on math ends at %  ^^)=😊.  loved the video. well done sir.... well done.

How did a stickman learn math faster than every human combined
daaam, a lot of explanations in one frame

O my god😮.
that battle cry at 10:02 was personal
Amazing 😮

Dude my brain.
As an avid enjoyer of mathematics, who has yet to ever feel that they have any kind of full grasp on it, I thoroughly an wholeheartedly love and appreciate this piece of magnificent art<3 Oh my did this spark a cosmic sense of joy in me, just watching this amazingly thought out work and it's extremely powerful, in a sense of impact and keen eye on detail, visualisation of the mighty force itself that is MATH! Awesome video, just truly awesome.

My son show me this video and this amazing. Is the visual how we learn and understand math. Thank you.
The Second Coming is super smart!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Aku baru tau matematika bisa sekeren itu :D
The ending really conveys that maths does not have limits
And all of this was just a dream of Orange who is trapped in "Animador vs Animations VI"?
Bro menciptakan alat pemusnah massal dari matematika yang mampu memusnahkan -1
Please bro next science=)
何度見ても面白いと思えるアランベッカーさんの動画は素晴らしいものだと思います！これから頑張ってください！応援してます！ (I think Alan Becker's videos are great, and they're always interesting no matter how many times I watch them! Good luck from now on! I support you!)
if bob ross has 3 paintings and he eats 2 pineapple what is the mass of the sun
make this a movie
MATH???!!! MATH IN THIS VIDEO IS SOOOOOO HARD!!!!!

have everything only when we control the lower castes people to reduce population then only we become developed nation the excessive population crisis and non implementation of Sterilisation program it need to be implemented from peon to member of parliament by hook or crook in all religions in bharat Males who are wasting their precious time from age 21 to 32 years just in preparation of various exams are creating trouble by reproducing and every male must write his surname clearly he belongs to which religion and which caste general category Shudra or Obc This time we all Rajput's and brahmins must unite together call for all Females and males of our community to prevent explosion of population and for resources of india The corruption is at its peak in bharat all the institution is only indulged in corruption from private to govt sectors the gram panchayat to nagar paalika nagar nigam the mayor of Pune jaipur lucknow takes 10 to 20% commission in any project and these lawyers with police and administration and politicians are make loot with unemployment at its peak in bharat All bars and benches are under the one community The Rajputs, Jaats Brahmins and kayastha only real rajputs not those backwards lodhs etc Politicians apart from party making mockery of people they hand in glove with each other across parties and in this bureaucracy, executive and bars and bench are involved Inside india now the universities just busy in making politicians by making fool to poor and lower class people educated unemployment is on its high I will name the universities Delhi ,awadh, ccs, kanpur, Devi ahilya, jadhavpur ,jaipur, only busy in making politicians by grabbing money from common educated people This is very ugly face of politics in bharat the politicians and their family members are only getting rich and wealthy while common educated people are continuously suffering in bharat I will repeatedly raise the issues what all political persons are doing from gram panchayat to parliament of India only nepotism in every field whether legislature executive or judiciary and so called fourth pillar the media and mediahouses running by businesshouses the politicians with bureaucracy executive and judiciary in high courts and supreme courts are blocked by few people from past 75 years and India is suffering of educated unemployment at its peak we are moving towards stagflation with politicians and businessmen who are politicians and their relatives are continuously getting benefitted  explosion of population must be dealt with heavy hand This time world community have to come forward to deal with excessive population of world and the govt in india is repeating again with bjp rest unemployment will remain bcoz politicians are equally corrupt like people made them across all the political parties common people is just a tool nothing more We females representation is very less in all curriculum courses in politics executive judiciary medical engineering needs more  The universities &schools must reduce excessive pressure on children and youths by making 50 -50% mcq and theory based examination in all domains from class 11 to ph.d.   this is to be applied at earliest we are witnessing suicides in India at peak

Omg, que hermoso😧‼️
Und math is harder 😵‍💫
+2 equals 100
2+2 = 22
Imagine teachers show this to kids you need to make math fun I'm 8 years old and math is so boring.
Si es cine 🗿🍷
I see you've found out the symbolic meaning of the + or "✝️".  God is in the numbers.
the math war
math won
he divided by 0
I poop
❤
thats exactly what my math teacher would say if i asked him why do i need math
THIS IS HOW YOU DO MATH!!
is it really 14 minutes long  if it is I'm gonna delete YouTube
=i×i×i
Second coming do 1×100
Or You Alan Bunker! So Stickman Attached ei or pie Or Stickman Deeded = f(infinite)
So Attached Stickman f(•) ????
the "WAAAAAHHHH"part😂
Orange learned in 14 minutes what I learned in 5 years ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1+99=100
Yjej
how did you manage to make math not boring you are just amazing
I have no idea what was happening, but it looked cool!
1+1=11😎
Multiverse of stickman
Alan and his team should make a movie
Me after this video: (mega mind)
Dude this is so clever
Between this and Number Lore, math fans eatin good.
holy frick this is amazing
Sbzksozlsap!
THIS WAS AMAZING make p2 if u want (pleas)
Simplemente cine 🗿🚬
I didn't understand anything, but it was epic
bro stickman was a college student
faz eles falando
This video is one of humanity’s greatest achievements
This should be a Netflix show
Can you make a sequel with all of oranges friends?
Animation vs Physic :)
this is why you should learn even the lesson you dont wanna study in school
Man I wanted to see him put a =mc squared on that bish
Te quiero mucho
the teachers so mad bc ur smarter then them
What happend to The - End?
math is meth
hi
wait, this isn't the tutorial on how to find x
I learned more about math from this than I ever did in school.
I kinda feel bad for the exit word :(
what if 1 + i happened
this is so awesome and cool
You made me complete my math homework
¡×¡×¡=math
Absolutely amazing
😮
This is… EPIC!
the begginning is wrong it's not 1+1=2 it's 1+1=35
Bro just called everyone dumb in animation
Вся математика в одном видио
7:44
Well, this math is like 10 or 12 grade
Pov your in math class
Why exponential is running 🤣🤣
That's why imaginary numbers are invented : they are so powerful
Please make more of these math animation
I like math I am an Indian I study in class 5
From 1 to a massive formula
Now, that's an EPIC math duel.
1+1=2 Mant
ORANGE IS SMART
my bum is medioka
He went addition to pi like wow
this man teaches math better then all the math teachers combined
Bro taught me more than my teacher
Wy is there a big robot there and it should not be the+end
Sheeesh, I kinda want a part 2 now
"Math is very easy!"  Also Math:
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😇😊😉🙂
YASS!!!
The Stick Guy wanted to go to the illogical world, the world that e^(i*pi) was going through via the door, but he couldn't since he was a positive entity (logical entity). So instead, e^(i*pi) reduced him into his primary structure via the infinite-dimension sphere and then converted it into negative, so he could be a negative entity and go into the illogical world.
math teachers will be surprise when they see this master peace
And this is how, I passed my test
This is what orange is dreaming while in the prison from ep wanted

what about 0 divied by 1 divided by 0
Day one of asking Alan Becker to do math versus math
alan becker's videos never disappoint😍
Starting:Math  End:BOSSFIGHT
RT I don't know what you think about it possible for type that...
ii am not shure but i dont think he likes pie
JUST USE YOUR MOUNTAIN DEW POWERS FROM LAST TIME TSC😊
Pamass👏👏👏👏👏👏
The reason why you can't divide by zero is because zero by itself is nothing, and it's impossible to divide a number into nothing.
so is dont know if anyone realised, but the thing he chases in the video is =-1. dually, its a play on names in the fact that Alan names his characters with titles in a similar fashion. the first character being The Chosen One. this -1 character being "The Negative One". Al u mad man.
dam u just make learning more fun
now we need Animation vs. Music (as in music theory)
This gave me interstellar vibe
Bruh discover on how to teleport people😮
Well i got an ad of this video, in one of the videos i watched a minute ago
Who thought that math can be so powerful and destructiv      Edit: Came back to remake my bad spelling and to watch this master peace again
what is that huge thing
WAWEASZOrBASA
-1 is just how to write e I pi
Pls make more videos like this
The second coming really pulled the infinity card from why
Bros made math fun, incredible
I dont understand nothing 😂
orange juice learned math way faster than me
bro i feel like this is all happening in tsc's mind while he's trapped in the cell from AvA 6
I wonder when this takes place in the AvA/AvM timeline.

I SUDDENLY UNDERSTAND HOW MATH WORKS MY TEST SCORES IMPROVED AFTER WATCHING THIS OMFG
Einstein would be so proud to see this

Next vs is Music vs animation
This is why math is attacking us bydaway your edit is so fire
Congrats. You made a video that will last forever in every high school and math class in America.
Музыка аш мурашки по коже😂
Guys we've found it, teleportation equals -1.
I'm surpriced we didnt see orange turn an i upsidedown and do facotorials. Also I can't believe you made the final boss of math 10:10
bro im 7 grader and this just made me evolve into 12 years of math exprience 💀
This animations is my infance i like this animations
Does Randall Munroe know about this? This has xkcd written all over it!
Are we gonna ingore the fact that TSC made a perfect circle
The sword is jim
Hy guys alan becker is very smart who know
10:34/10:35  What I learned: 1+1  The test: 1÷1  What I remember:
Alan becker who is rhe orange stickman pls say the name of the orange one
If hollywood has any sense, they will turn this into a giant live action blockbuster series. Stuff like this could legitimately cause a global cultural shift in how people think and learn and what they enjoy.
HEY
Маз типа Галина?
I have an awesome idea. We should have a 2D or 3D video game where you can fight other players with using maths. A game with same idea  of this video.
this guy can use anything as a weapon.
My brain… it hurts
a small but really smart animation
I remember messing with a laptop calculator and I got inf
Honestly we should have more animation vs maths
i need an animation vs math part 2!!!
damn alan forced to study math just to make this 14 minutes animation
e iπ＝-1吗
i would like to see more likes under the video,  this is a masterwork
I only knew everything until the exponents part. After that, my sister explained most of it.
I like this video ❤
1:04 that a sad no friend to share knowledge😢

As for i can see this thing is like the Interestellar of the mathematicians
ANIMATION VS ELA PLS!
Jendela
10:46 bro i think u need to improve your aim
if my school math lesson is not to write but watch their animation like this it would be my favorite subject
why are the chapters “Xbox 360 2005 or 2010” for me
Hey Alan make a part 2 so I can have fun
Please Alan Becker notice me make more videos like this with math stuff it was really cool and epic please
New idea animation v letters
What’s the music you used in this video
Idk why but 3:31 is one of the most satisfying things in this entire video
This is what i mean when u say math is fun
He probably had to go back to school just to make this video 💀💀💀
So lemme guess this straight… He owns a pencil He has a awakening form  And now he has 5000 math iq
dopppest edit of all time
me pregunto cuando saldrá el siguiente capitulo
buena animación:(10) musica:(10) matemáticas:(10) video:(10)
The math video this Nice like and subsucribe
Hi, this project is a true master piece, is just Math made art. My children and I we enjoyed this video, my 8yo son loved it. Hope you make the children see Maths from a different point of view, showing the beauty there is inside it. A big THANKYOU from a teacher in Málaga, Spain
Is so good
WAS THAT A DAMN ALEPH KNOLL AT THE END!?!?!?
😅 8:34 whaat !?
It is true what they say “math is power”
The only person who made math more interesting with one video than math in the classroom❤
Let do this
I'm so exicted... This is greatest animation that i've ever seen 🔥
bro💀
Maths is finally fun
THAT WAS F-ING CRAZY DUDE
🤯
the most simple gameplay of cauculator
This is the first time I actually had interest in learning Math.
Now we just need Animation vs. Physics.
bro is א  THE END
This is a better way to show how math works well better than my teachers
31M
can someone explain why the "e" runs away from him all the time?
Bro where is his friends bruh💀
bro got a literal death star☠️

so cool
Why does TSC wanna fight the e…
Do more of this btw like your videos

Bro the scream cracked me up at 10:02🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
That's the power of math,
TSC learned more math in 14 minutes than I did in 14 years
Fun fact: this is what the AP Calculus exam looks like
Tsc: all I wanted was peace now it’s a war  *few minutes later*     *tsc and whatever his name is are now friends*
Only he can make math fun
Math and other person work
this is amazing 🤩
I like that, at some point, orange literally became a bowling ball

Learning math be like:
This is the only math vid I will ever watch in my life
I think this explained math better than any of my teachers could.
wow my friend is a mathematichian and he got confused
This video is good! Keep the work up!

I wish it was this ez.
I like your animation.  Animation is my life.
Only Alan Becker can make math fun
I kinda like math the problem is that sometimes the things that math teachers teach you is so hard
9:55 e
Wow stickman are smart
11:05 PLEASE MURCY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
What's the name of this music?
im from greece
How much math did u have to learn just for a single video
Naw orange guy ain’t playing anymore 8:31 Naw bro really isn’t playin anymore 9:27 NAW NOw THERE NOT PLAYING ANYMORE 9:53  NAW NOW ORANGE GUY MADE THE DEATH STAR 10:29
The stickman he's has 6283 IQ 🧠
my mind in math class =
It would be interesting and kinda cool to see orange interact with math like this in the newest animation vs animator in my opinion!
Bro did so much deep diving for this.
esto es lo mas esperado de youtube this is the most expected of youtube
Top tier animation
TSC probably just fell into the cpu
From "1" to Greatness from god to all of Existense..
maths can be fun if you are a stickman
I didn’t know math went this far😂
What
I showed this to my math teacher lol. 💀💀 Edit: i actually did
New Video?
second coming is smart real
This math entity is one of if not the strongest that they ever faced only to beat it its to use math as well And the math power succeed  the power of the minecraft icon
1+1= 2 where 2 (even) is emergent in regards to 1 (odd)
The end was so beautiful 🥺🥺🥺🥺
it's really fantastic animation that i've ever seen in my life
This takes crunching the numbers to a new level
Part 2 plz
Pls santet eps 2😓

10:00 idk what happened but damn, that was epic af.
spectacular
como lo puedo descargar
you know its a epic day when Alan Becker uploads.
If Godzilla knew how math works that means he will turn into numberzilla right?
this one slapped I need another watched it 103 times
And they say school helps you more then videos well look at us now
Bruh this is better then math in school..
okay probably my new fav video
Hey Alan Becker! Do you support lgbt?
Now I know why people think math is cool

Hello Alan, Please re-upload animation versus animator
Це афігенно, стільки ж тут роботи
Create a game with stickmans !
this is art
One day I’m going to become a math prof and teach a mathematics appreciation class in which this is our syllabus
🤓☝
bro explained the whole subject of math in 14 mins
This amazing
You know it's a great video when I didn't even understand half the thins and yet still liked it Great job!!
This is basicly my math class
My head: WHAT?
i×i×i=i*ie^i(pi)
sqrt(-1)=i
a^1/2=sqrt(a)
5d=1024
4d=512
3d=128
-1=e^i(pi)
but asdoer 2=1+1
1+1=2
now thats an interesting math lesson
=f(.)

Another Alan Becker Masterpiece. This is Cristopher Nolan levels of good.
10:02 1 10:33 1.5 10:56 2
this kind of thing makes me hate math less.
I guess this is the math equivalent of alphabet lore.  But, this is definitely a lot more satisfying to watch.  Also, @ 13:26 Shows it all goes back to Euler's identity with -1, which we saw @ 1:38  Even though i don't know half the math in this video, it somehow really makes me think outside the box for this kind of stuff. (Leonhard Euler was definitely a math genius, especially considering he was born in 1707!)

well why didnt they teach me this from grade 0?
😮 esto es una maravilla matemática e una artística
GOOD
he made math actually interesting
From the little I understand and seeing a more basic correlation between the ending and the beginning, Orange is "1", which is the first number we see. By the end, the formula gives a -1, which means Orange was subtracted from the Math Universe? Also, shows the value of e^iπ, which is -1  Explains why both were "enemies" in this animation, Orange is 1, but e^iπ is -1.
eiπ
I can hardly believe that "the square root of negative 1 = i" is still being taught as standard. Easily the single biggest piece of misinformation in current mathematics. 🤦‍♂️
Opa
Who is better at teaching math: Alan and TSC or Kumon
Imagine TSC telling to the others sticks what happened.
animation vs googology when???
Those editors really need a golden medal about how great the animations are, respect!!
For anybody wondering what the names of the symbols at the end are, (like me) their names are delta (circle with tail), zeta (strange s), phi (circle with line), and aleph (big one)

everyday your animation keeps getting better
This would be cool if this was a whole video game
You know I am a biology student 💀>>>.
god damn
this has kept me motivated of doing math for the past month
:)
this is my foerever cool this is soo cool
I still fail my math exam even after watching this
The fact that Alan copied The Sumerians'  work is outrageous. What a copy cat.
This animation is so good. I wish math was real.
There's something that's giving me a hard time. It makes me angry, Sadly, I do.  It's math
א?????!!!!!!?
This is what happens in your calculator
Wow
I feel like this is just going over my head but if i understood it i would learn
This is the most enjoyment I’ve ever gotten out of a math video ever, but I’m surely not the first and far from the last to say this
This looks awesome
That's BEYOND AMAZING
I didn't understand one bit
Кубрик отдыхает!Эйнштейн бы сума сошел от своей узости и самовлюбленности!  Училка моя по математики ушла бы в технички!   Но мне страшно. Куда исчез человечек когда поклонился  Е. Это конец?  Я не математик  .

Hi
Can't believe the mega-villain:integral from 0 to infinity, got taken down. Well it was only possible cause of Cartesian plane
This is so cool!!!! I loved every second of it!!! Truly amazing!!
I need to show that to my math teacher no joke
This whole video is just the coolest sounds.
The animation it's so cool
The orange IQ maybe 200+
Make  a part 2!
Math teachers: please! Pay attention! This will be very important later in life Majority of us: Yeah right, when? Alan:
I like how he had too learn all of this math just for a video!❤
I was able to understand math beyond my potential and grade level from this very video.
Bro I just started 8th grade and now I’m scared
If they showed this in high school and college this is gonna break the whole school sphere
7:11 stealing numbers
4:41 telling math instructions
about 1minute in and I was lost. if I stopped and tried, could this be...educational? like is this a witty math tutorial? sorry, I got a thing where my brain has trouble with numbers.
cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Pls Do Animation Vs Cursor Part 1 Rise Of The Mouse
He really made math interesting, I sat here and watch the whole thing and actually enjoyed it, this felt like a movie and I really like it, keep up the great work
now the math vs animation? it rests the air vs amimation
Everything is sums....💀💀
he’s becoming smarter
I knew as soon as e^iπ showed up that I was in for a treat.

Bro should have an oscar
It's unbelievable
Meanwhile PhD graduate in maths getting orgasm while watching this.
This is like math, but a different way
He need an oscar
Incredible.

If only math was this fun i would enjoyed school
Spektakuler.. Sangat hebat videonya, terima kasih sudah upload

very good like it
My brain is so confused with this its good and bad

Feeling dumb watching an animation about math… yup, that’s me…
Could you make a video of animation vs roblox?
This video explains my struggle with understanding the Euler's formula during g12 😅
BRO JUST SUMMONED pi💀
Bro know more math than me
Thats better than every math teacher they should use this viedeo in shool😊
When im late for School: 11:15
it's beautiful
Me : "There's no way maths can be fun" Alan : "You sure about that?"
As a student, I can agree upon that this is how we do our math homework
Can anyone explain why TSC is going so far to kill the thing? My man straight up saw something and chose violence as a greet.
e
This is the coolest, smartest, most crrative thing ive seen in a *while*
Lol my brain almost shat
Imagine if you got an animation like this for every math class
Animations vs physical pls
I want a math course that starts with this video on the first day, and then proceeds to say "at the end of this course, you will understand every reference"
YOU FOOL
😮❤
7:12 was cool
kids, this is why its good to learn math
9:49 Higher maths VS me
Your animations are Fire! (In a great way)
"Hey class how was your day! And also bob how did you learn tour math?"    ........."A stickfigure"

I don't know why but he just explained math perfectly. Math is evil
Death to math
😕😕😕😕😄😄😄4+4=8
At 10:47, the up and coming made the deatstar
Its crazy what you can do with math😂
Math has never being so fun till just now
Itszz wat yy
lovely
Only one word. Masterclass
This is great! But not to be that guy, but the funky digit at the end, apparently people who do the dirty with animals are butchering that symbol of math and using that symbol as their flag for pride.
Everything I've ever learnt... But fun
sencillamente genial esta animacion la manera en que represento la evolucion natural de las matematicas es increible, eres genial Alan Becker
Congrats on 1 million likes & 30 million views in 2 months

Bro, how'd you make math cool? How?!
The test:
太厉害了
Everyone gangsta until Aleph_0 shows up (he is the smallest in his family)
imagin this in vr
He learned in 3 minutes what I learned in 8 years
Someone needs to make a video breakdowns of this..i can't remember much of match, or ever knew too much :)) Amazing!!!
1+1+1+1=4
I like math😊
Never imagined maths could be so funny 😂
Add Math*
Incredible animation
You have my respect stark....... subscribed!!!!

LoL ha ha ha ha 😂
I don't know what you think of the year and a great day∞  join me🙏🙏🙏🙏 1=1*2

can someone make this a game
This is how I like to imagine how the mathematicians discovered the ungodly things I see in Calc 2
This motivates me to do math and understand.
hasta π le entendi xd
Im not good at math but this is nice to watch i hope i get better and better with time.
Isso é incrivel mano
DANG THAT WAS AMAZING 😮😃
Keep emoji/character span to a minimal! (2 chat lines max)  Use common sense and be respectful to others!  No self-promotion or impersonation! Thank you!
Wow you know this is the only time I will ever watch a video about math
Si 2 y 2 son 4 4 y 4 son 8 y 8 sería 16 🤓
Music?
teachers better be usin this video
I was completely lost when they got to the circles
I'm kidding😂
1+1=11😎
Never knew that 1 was the holy grail of Mathematics after all, until he messed with Euler's formula and summoned negative one in the normal realm where he isn't supposed to be, but to think he summoned him, just to get out of the realm that he isn't supposed to is remarkable for someone like me with two brain cells to spare.
Mat trolly hundraprocentig Evil
LETS GO I AM THE 1 MILIONTH LIKE 1 IN 1M LETS GOOO
My brain gg.
So complicated yet so cool
someone please make this a video game
Wow comedy 😀
Wow he can attack with infinite speed.
i learned A LOT
I was good in math. But i admit seeing your character modifying it like that gives me an headache.
Matht belike😅😅😅😅
hes smarter than me
Ok je comprend
1+10000000000000000000=
dude represented this in a simple  as well as most complex way possible
Hey TSC is smart man
Bro turned into albert einstein
Nogas😢
Oh come on you reminded me of school.
My fellow idiots join me in stupidity 👇

این ویدیو عالی بود! حق سازنده ویدیو بیش از در آمدِ یوتیوبش است!
The biggest collaboration yet between two different stick animation communities :)
bro can you make the animatinon vs. math #2
esto es mejor que las series de netflix
I need to study... but... this is just as good, right?
telepotation theory
Jolly good show!
Come to think of it maybe it was true, alan is a havard student...
이해하면 얼마나 재밌을까..
Hey! I want a calculator like that! That makes math look so fun!
😂😂😂
Bro just broke a dimension out of nowhere that escalated fast
Richard waterson finally beat calculator
math

If I was in this world I would stay for a whole year
At 11:03 I thought that man was dead for sure that gun was to op at 11:10 Is through that part 11:03 - 11:10
Oh im definitely sending this to my math teacher
What the teachers ment by math is fun
0:13 what my teacher teaches me 8:22 the homework
i dont understand
🤝
Its good.❤❤❤❤
I don’t know why, but I feel like this is somehow related to Wanted
My braincells got 1000 got only watching thid
This guy needs a movie
My brain watching this👁👄👁
Bro taught us maths better than school
Imagine an actual pvp where players use their math knowledge to defend and attack tryna neutralize each other.
Waaaaaaat
6:47 HES HOLDING A SIN (H  E L P)
I wonder if the ending is hinting that the math realm- whatever is the source of TCO's portals. Cause the portal orange went through to escape looks kinda similar to TCO's portals. Not to mention the shaking after e's (gonna call the little math guy e) friends showed up could signify that whoever captured TCO is trying to access the math realm. They have already shown they have access to things that can tap into the source code (Example: the weapons that glitched out TCO and the hotbar thing the stick figure with sunglasses used to fight TSC.) As well as the minor connection thats kinda out there of the fact computer code is mainly 1s and 0s. But who knows! I generally like to talk about this kinda stuff so-  TCO: The Chosen One TSC: The Second Coming (or Orange aka the guy fighting e in the video)
I like how this guy learnt math faster than I have in 10 years
When we learn maths: the students...
"No mathematicians were harmed in the making of this video"
Bro had taken the death star from star wars and used it to fight math💀💀💀☠
If anybody wondered what the stomping at the end was it was an almost invisible Nolan sign aka the smallest infinity
Now im worse at math
This is great.
If everyone had a math teacher like this, no one would hate math anymore.
My favorite 🫶👏👏👍
سحخ😅زنستج.
And they said math is boring
Nerds
This is amazing. This needs to become a teaching tool. This is a wonderful example of how math builds on itself. Thank you for this.
Orange might be smart than Yellow😅

i dont get the later third in its entirety because im not that deep into math, but why start with 1? i would have started with 0, the void, the equilibrium, the singularity of all possibilities in its stable form? 0 could have become 1=1 and 1=1 could have become 1+1=2, etc.  ; sero is the only (simple) neutral thing that does not need an equal. just putting that random 1 out there makes you question where it came from? 0 doesent need causality to be a thing.
The animation was defending him after he attacked the first time, and then the math thing. Whatever it’s called, started attacking him when they could’ve been friends instead of enemies
I don’t know why, but this is giving me bone lab vibes
The coolest math example I've ever seen in my life
Emaiks
Bro just wants e😭
"Это видео понятнее 11 лет математики в школе" 💀
Bro 10:50 is gorilla tag
How orange in this place
Can I go back in time and learn math from this video instead?
yeah I have no damn clue how math works.
This is absolutely amazing, this is my favourite animation I’ve seen in a long time!
Dang, this stick figure is better at math than me. The fact that TSC is a fast learner doesn’t surprise me that much. ➕
M A T H
This is a reason, why I want learn Math in my 37. Ironic that I hate it in school. Happy because I understand around 5% of all (I believe).
wonderful math
He goes through all grades of math. I'm in 5th and i don't know the half of it.
They always find a way to trouble. Even in a blank room.
In this video. There is math from elementary school to School of Engineering
he is so smarty
THANK YOU FOR TEACHING ME MATH
Wow this is awesome
7:35  butt fall!
Epic
Some goofy stickman>>>> teachers
Im scared
buah que maravilla de video, me hizo recordar cuando tenia aprendido  algunas formulas , eres un crack!    por cierto, supongo que lo habras pensado pero,   una animation explicando como funcionas las señales que viajan a internet,  hay muchos numeros y letras complejos que muchas personas lo desconocen por la dificil explicacion.😉
Mükemmel❤
a lot
Somehow a mute stickfiger Taught me better than my actual school
Holy
Hola soy un suscriptor argentina o americano del sur y te pido por favor parte 2 :D
You made a classic. Absolutely amazing !!
THIS is very cool
It’s amazing how all of it came from the number 1 this shows how cool and important math can be
Top smart 😂😂
This is a masterpiece
Oranges using a gun? =f(♾️)

Hi im new here!
When the second comer reaches 100. No one celebrates exfept the second comer
bro jump into ohio😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 7:34
eipi went crazy!
Is that guy an English coach?
That looks like a last minute study induced nightmare,
I came here to measure the circumference of TSC's head
Now im done with college
1+1=?😂1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=?🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Math is confusing
nice
Pov I who am not understanding those mathematical numbers
My brain will  be loading
Now we need a real life version of the =ƒ(•) gun and also an extra =ƒ(∞) for people who bought two
This Animation Is Better Than Schools
It would be really cool if you could interact with math like this irl
牛逼
It ended and i didnt even know
I am trying to find the bottom of the comments
Bruh we already seen this
this mightve been what encouraged albert einstein to do math
siuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
The only way to make math fun
Bro uhh yea because of this vid i relearned the circle thank you man
this is really cool man
the sound effects are making me feel better than ever
this is better than the marvel movie
El profe: Tranquilos el examen es facil El examen:
Man why can't we watch this in math class
Just watching this makes me feel smarter while gaining no actual knowledge  Also that sound design was nutty
At first i feel like e was bad and annoying but at the end i thinks e was so cute and adorable❤
no entiendooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
When I saw this I thought it was going to be him awnser questions put now that I see this is amazing
e
*Not me just not understanding math*
Imagine  Alan Becker gets Nobel Prize instead of Oscar
Bro deally used the sideways calculator
Wowzers
This man can make a mini movie out of literally anything
4:41 the power of addition compels you, demon!
天才の思考か
most entertaining video ive seen in months
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ this is my favorite animation
good video, too bad I didn't understand almost anything
a masterpiece
very good animation
Was scrolling by and saw this video, haven't watched it yet but the answer is 11, have a great day :)
It's genius!
is this part of the new season or not? im dumb.
This man is learning skills how to fight lol
1+1=2+2=นู๋
You make my dream happy😊❤
this went from learning msth to a massive epic fight to fixing stuff HOW DO YOU MAKE IT SO GOOD DEAR GOD THIS VID IS AMAZING!
Bro is a genius😭
Now i realise that it's not my mistake it's my math teachers mistake, this video opens my mind in math but she failed to do that ....
me during math be like:
hello
Alan just changed my opinion on what superpower I would want😂
Bro has more interaction with math than I have with a fully customizable for every part tool kit
I’m firing my laser 11:06
I know he has once topped in maths However, it's a op animation
We just explore the whole mathematics in one video.
In just one video that I thought was entertaining, he crammed more than 40 knowledge of math into it, and what surprised me was that all of them were correct.(except for some errors that are difficult to recognize about the plus and minus signs 4:15 ) I really admire your talent
א
Every math channel is impressed and jealous^2.
ta bien
amazing video 👏👏
Beautiful.
dis crazy
Bro became smarter than me in math only for 14 minutes
Ada Bayu
Ajjsjz
Please create the animation vs. Math Episode 2 please.
Math is not funny.   El Alan becker bien tan csm que me perdí el traducción:
"You cant make math fun!" Me: watch this🗿
Bro taught more math than i could understand
The sound design in this is like actually insane. Like something out of a fu*king Nolan movie, and I don’t even care if it’s all Epidemic sound or some other cheap site because the way it’s used still amazed me like crazy
this Stickman has learned more in one video than I have in five years at school!
Bro turned math stuff into a boss fight.
WTF , this is the most awesome video I've seen in ages
If my math teacher played this. I might pay attention.
stickman is king epic  cuz he blasted a spear of lighting to the living organisim
Bro This Is Like A War☠️ The Title Should Be Maths War
I would have a lot more fun with maths was like this in real life
Dang idk why he is good but I think he is learning so fast
❤❤
Who gave you permission to make math interesting and fun
Holy MOLY that was Cinematic
Оригинально, круто, прикольно.
For the first time math was fun
I learned more in this video than in all of math
My brain can’t process so much math 🥲
Alan, make an burger king ad with your stick figures
The real genius
Span({x¹,x²,x³,x⁴}) = R⁴ (What does span mean? What is span?)
This stickman understand math better than i ever will in 50 years
Did Alan Becker had to learn math to?
I hate dealing with the backward E in math my brain was always fried!! but this was entertaining.
Bro made a gamma-ray burst
Математика рулит!
Tsc is probably the  probably the smartest person in the gang now
Dang, I never even knew some of this math existed. This was absolutely amazing and was a joy to watch, everyone who worked on it did a wonderful job
As an engineering student, it was fascinating to see the math I learn and study everyday visualized like this. Amazing video!
This really should have been Yellow’s episode.
👍🗿
They better start using this to teach kids math
This would be a great vr game
AYE LIKE ALAN BECKER
Did this guy just did my math homework 💀💀💀💀
Why is there just an א (the first letter in the hebrew alphabet) at the end, does this mean there is an Animation vs Language coming????
I wanted to join the members, but how?
Did anyone notice that there was something moving in the background at the end? Overall, this was amazing as always Alan, great work!
dose anybody kwon whats 1+1
Menuda pasada hermano. Sin palabras.
Imagine they make a video in real life
Bro's creativity level is x/0 😍
If my math teacher showed me this at school math would be my fav subject
POV: me on math exam:
this is just math with Minecraft experience
End of the video factorial--> gamma function
Who can imagine the iq tsc earned
Goddamn, I gotta show this to my class.
that’s just Students vs Math Teacher
Bro why is Ñ so big?
This makes math 80000x cooler
bro just explained 18 years of math into 14 minutes
I was looking for Ω & Δ, not δ and ζ
That feeling when you learned more from 1 video than in 11 years
Bro if that was like learning I 😂would watch it all the time like with the big explosions like omfg
Hi Alan please make Need for Speed vs Animation
14:00
1 billion iq
Esto es cine
Animation vs. Math but in word math change "a" to "e"
that was beautiful
Ah yes my favourite weapon "The Sin and Cos"
If there was a game like this I would fiddle with numbers the whole day
Teacher "math is easy" Math:
10+10=20
the, beauty of maths,
Hypothesis from the offspring: Dude in the chair is Victim.
1+1 is 69
i think math was not bored anymore
does anyone know the name of the music
Me playing with a calculator
What was the giant N thing at the end?

K 1:23
hermano se que no hablas español pero a la verga, me duele la cabeza no solo por intentar seguir el ritmo a las ecuaciones sino porque desbloqueaste varios recuerdos de mis clases de fisica y ahora estoy intentando decifrar gran parte de lo que vi, muy buen video por cierto, eres god
Thanks!
Dude I wish I was as smart as orange stick man also this was funny cute and beautiful to watch also it would be so helpful for math homework
Math II
Me who is a math nerd and able to understand most of the equation, this animation is outstanding
you soo smart ar you mek thes video whith kalkulator ha
In the first four minutes he learned more about math than I have in 5 years
It's time for you to get an Oscar
I want my math teacher to showcase this
If our teacher taught math like this I'd be totally interested
intersting
Brilliant !
이과가 좋아하는 영상
Bro the music is a vibe
Awsome❤❤❤
I need to see this become a real video game where you can build with math
Epic
if only teacher teached math like this
Who knew math could be so epic
nuke boom
gorilla tag
:O
need more videos Like This explaining math  !!!! Insanely good made video 👏🏼
Animation vs terraria please !
This actually helped me understand matrices, and sin/cos better. :O
Bro became alber Einstein
Nice❤
We need "the - end"
Fun Fact: The Second Coming almost Defeat Yellow's Brain
MATH HAS LORE NOW??
I gained 40 Braincells watching this
When you demonstrate learning math in the future but demonstrated not in the future:
Maths in school❌ Maths with the second coming✅
Bro which application you using to animate this
🤯🤯😱🤯
bro learned more maths in 14 minutes than me in 14 years 💀💀
What a masterpiece
e goodnight
Bro be acting like tony stark doing tech stuff
Alan needs to make his own movie with his characters.
The giant Aleph Null at the end gives me hope that there could be a sequel to this covering higher order infinities (ZFC, number theory, etc.)
That was anticlimactic 😂
this stickman learned kindergarten to college level math in the span of 14 minutes...
i never thought one day i would se e running and it being adorable
"Asian power 100% unlocked"
Bro had an all out war with the letter e.
Mind blowing.. amazing!!👏🏻🤍
wtf is goin on...
what happens
This is what teachers wish smartboards were like
This really conveys how Orange is a absolute master in all forms of art
I learned college-level math due to just watching this. Somehow it kept my interest
I understand a bit but my head could not calculate really fast... it takes me 2 minutes and 1 hour to solve it...
Math in a nutshell:   Bro kids can skip school if they watch this fire animation
Why am i all of a sudden crying at the end does that = normal?
watched this in calc and just now showed my brother and noticed the giant dark "x" at the end, such a cool video
3 mins into the vid to much math I confused
So this video tells that stickman wants to get out of the world of mathematics but there is a misunderstanding and causes war accidentally, just because misunderstanding can cause such a big problem as the damage in 11:34 which affects the imaginary dimension or the world of mathematics
Orange is so smart 🤩
me encanta io quiero en la computadora
Ahh so coooool ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉
amo seu canal
2:49 The Stickman just clearly divided by zero
this taught me more than school😂😂😂
Your just here because he uploaded an animation aren't you?! Me too
Dude the sound design is so cool.
He learned math faster than me
The only maths thing was the sine curve coming out of the circle other than that it might as well be animation vs the alphabet. It bothers me this is how ppl think of maths. Good job on the animation tho.
I'M A FAN MAKE ANIMATION VS BFDI 🙏PLS🙏
Mind blown! 🫨
アランさんって数学オタクだったの！？天才じゃないか､､､
Super
Норм видео но нет разговора 7:02
I liek dis
Theacher and me a my brain🤯
Death Star
5:08 if it was blue then he would have got it
I don't think many people realized how smart he really is. TSC learnt math in literally 14 minutes while most of us took a year just to learn basic addition
🤯Nerd
要长脑子了🧠
1:43 so hes the jerk that added letters to math
Oke😂
Bruh the big is א
No idea what was happening here but I was invested
Kinda funny how he was able to teach something that schools takes years to teach us in 14 minutes😂
I'm enjoying this for free... No cost at all... This feels incredibly illegal... In a good way....
Bro Alan is the type of dude who can make math cool and fun 💀 I actually learned a bit as well but still wth I didn't know math could be like this why is it so hard 🗿
The sound design is a masterclass on its own
POV: Your brain during math class
Esse vídeo é muito inteligente
you are the goat
Ok gotta say its soo cooll but the problem.... Yes theres a problem what is it? Well im 6th grade rhgit now sooooo that mean im gonna be dead whn i go to highschool becase it looks so hard on this animation but TSC is built diffrent so i understand on how he knows all of that... But im now sacerd.
Incredible. The capacity of this to both motivate students and connect math to geometry, which is damn important given that your average high school teacher doesn't even realize that there is a connection, is stellar. It deserves to be shown in schools around the globe.
He learned math in 50 mins
bro got beef w e to the power of pie
I walish this is what schools would use to teach us
-1 is forever cursed
aqui sub ispano parlante se nota la diferencia en tu animacion
“The math nerd”
....uhh
math is your enemy
Plz favorite my comment it would make my day
Its very cool video
Good content of course
13:48 was that an aleph null I saw there? xD
My guy just explained math in 842 seconds better than any teacher ever could in 11 years 💀
Alan Becker made math fun, would be nice to understand it though 🥲
We r waiting 2 absoluetly ❤❤❤😊😊😂😂
Pls make a game
I want a movie with animation 🆚 real life
how I learn math in school be like🧠🧠🧠🧠
A mi tío y. Mi sele rompió la cabeza
Man made math entertaining for everyone.
wow😮
This is amazing
When yellow is the animator
It took the chosen one 15 minutes to learn math while I'm still learning it
Wow
I like how I'm getting a minimal space vibe from this Ani. Arion you see tsc making equations gradually getting bigger and bigger it's such a space anyone can dream off fun is indeed infinity
Hi
Wow, now that is just magnificent
7:17 the thing behind him looked cool
they turn math animation to another level
All my nightmares are here😂
We need next part😂😂😂😂please❤❤❤❤❤❤

Now I hate math
I feel like I just went through Quantum science.
I will make this! 4:54
Alan.!!! YOU are my Friends ❤❤❤
Alan please make a season 4 of animation vs minecraft and the third coming ?? Hey math didnt u know tsc has been in alot of battles ??
7:10 I choked on water when I realized
Its delightful to see, how e^ipi is connecting the imaginary world to the real world.

This should get a awared
This should be a movie for kids in school
Wow,this is so good and at the end eiπ=-1 removing the stickman from its world
Bro the friend ita א
e, the most epic final boss.
The way we should all learn math 😅
I completely lost it when Euler's number got angry when TSC kept trying to mess with it.  I never actually *thought* about 'e' getting angry when people used it, but as someone who had to use natural logs in their day to day... it makes sense that 'e' would get angry... it's like 'what puny creature dares disturb ME???'
Wow, bequtiful libro de algebra porque no eres interesante pero esto si

Orange has so much experience in fighting no one can defeat him

This is Awesoooooooooooooooooooooooooooome !!!!
Alan! I want to say that I would like to see a series where all the stickmans either met their female versions or just a stickman girl appeared, at least for 1 series I would just really like to watch 💛💛
this is very good, i like it very much
Happy ending
You know what gonna be next Ω ω
Hola
999tys nice
What an amazing way to interpret math. I can imagine all the learning capabilities and outcomes of this. Kudos to you Alan & your lead animator.

Cool👍
imagine one days your math teacher just pulls up a tv and showed you this
Thank you!! As a lay person, I was able to keep up with the math to a point, but getting lost in it, I was still able to appreciate the absolute genius this wonder truly is!! ❤
Teachers: “I’m going to give you something easy for maths” the math:
4:16 e= -cos(π)+isin(π)
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
1+1=11 _🗿_
Can we just appreciate how TSC went from basic addition to the far end of Calculus in under twenty minutes. That is a hell of a learning curve.
this has to be a DMT dream or something, it's too beautiful

What type of animation program did you use to make this fascinating illustration?
e^(i*π) is eternal!
I was expecting Fourier to appear and transform those sinusoids in Dirac deltas! Amazing
Even after a month I am still watching this.
I feel like this episode could be used in schools.
Really awesome even for me not understanding maths very much
It must take hours and hours to make this content!  Really impressive stuff.
And it all started at 1

This scene  need oscar
One word fascinating

Bro change everything on math
Wow, man I wish I understood math so that I could enjoy this more
Dont undertsand this math but very cool
So...does this this make Second even more of a nerd then Yellow now?
I learned 30 percent of mathematics in these 15 minutes than in 8 years of study

HE KNOWS DA MATHS!
Waiting for Animation vs. Physics day 1
Alan pls add a part 2 to this it was amazing
Epic
BRO HOW DOES HE HAVE  A LAZER BEAM THE SIZE OF THE SUN LIKE IT IS THE SUN
Ngl i wish math was interactive like this irl, i think it would be more fun and could make it easier for you to discover new things about it, kinda like how orange pulled the plus sign and then just tilted a bit and diacovered the multiplier
3:46
数学ができればもっと楽しくみれるんだろうなあ！！(血涙)
stickman taught us mathematics 😅
hi
wait until they learn about the z axis and numebrs start going sideways

I knew he Is going to build death star
the music is just on point i say
It's fun how SC starts off on the simplest basics of math, and then works his way up more complex equations (School system reference).
1 plus 1 is 2
He didnt teach us math. he entertained us with math.
might be a bit of a controversial opinion but I feel like Euler's Identity was kinda justified in their aggression
bros smarter than yellow 💀

Cangratulations this is amazing
Original number lore:
ata, agr entendi a escola
how does he count past 2?

I understand almost none of the math in this animation but dang does it look cool
BRO THAT ANIMATON IS INSAIN THO
maff
Bro made death star 10:33
You should make it become a movie.
creative with accuracy 👌
I never thought that Math could be SO Epic! That's very cool!!!

This man is crazy, the logic here is very exact. I say this because I'm not good at mathematics, but this work with such careful animation is beautiful. I have no idea how much has been invested in this but the summary is simply insane.
Music?

Its also funny he is still at 23m subs
It's funny that he still remembers school
This super good for kids who don't know math

Our teachers gave math a bad reputation in our young minds, and we hate it, but in reality; math is the most fun subject that can be taught...if taught correctly.
Bruh tsc just holds the + sign like it’s the cross
this just further more proves that alan can do more than just minecraft aniamtions
This music is a The portal 2
Please can you make an animate of. Animation vs physic
Animation: excellent.  Math: on-point.  Plot: irrational.  9 + 9(1/9) out of 10.
I have no idea what I just watched
is so cool
They should just use this to teach math at school
Learn at the School:👎 Learn with Alan Becker:👍
Bhaktit
все закончилось на синусе и косинусе, дальше нихуя не понятно)))
This is what I see when I do math
It all started with a 1...
Alan is the only one who can make math exciting
this is amazing!! i watched it 3 times in one day
Он выучил всю математику за 14 минут, а мы не можем за 11 лет

этот человечек прошел 11 лет математики в русской школе за 14 минут
He is a smart little guy
Be math no e
That music so cool thx alan becker

Alan Becker should be our new math teacher.
2:54 not that
Do animation vs science plsssssss🎉🎉
Why dose the music give me portal vibes?
The fight is basically math tests lol
Greatest battle
Al final todos somos simples matemáticas
is that the end of animations vs Minecraft?
THIS IS SO AWESOME ❤❤❤❤
Bro how.
bro turned math into an action movie💀
I don't remember this in school,we never had death battles and wars.

Bro really recreate ou history to learn math
This is way more complicated and complex than i thought it would be 💀 Bro i thought it was going to be only 1 + 1
That's crazy

Orange loves, hates math
when an animator is also good at maths;]
When did you allow the Animation into the calculator.
e^(iπ) didn't actually do anything wrong...
Now high school math teachers have something fun to play on the last day of school!
9:58 is cute
sqrt(-1) = i and i = i (apparently)
Wait, I think I just... Learned... Something. Wow.
=f(•)
I feel changed after this for it shows a better understanding of the power of math
It's great but I didn't understand anything
A pure masterpiece! Very cool!
He only took few mins To learn theese, While we spend our entire life at school to learn all of theese.
gg 😅☝
He just went through almost all the math I’ve ever learned in 14 minutes
i actually cried when i watched  e^{i\pi } = -1
shh hes learning
Everybody gangster til animation vs physics is made
Animation and sound design were absolutely bunkers in this one!!!

Please do a part 2!
Bro learned all math in 14 minutes while it took me +12 years 😭
If only it was this simple
I always thought that wizard battles are like this.. using complex math to manipulate their power.. and now I want wizard battle to have this sound effect..
I honestly think a math teacher could play this at 0.5 speed and split it up into parts to teach different grade levels
X: math is boring This GigaChad (Alan backer):🗿
I want this as a VR game
Я за 1 видио узнал больше чем в школе за 9 лет😂

Here's an idea: Animation vs. After Effects
I hate trig. Stupid thetas and sin cos graphs and the million identities you have to memorize
Now I realize that math is very interesting.
Imagine Math as a game, this is what you get if you do

Can you do Animation vs Physics?
Blud knew Math for 10 minutes and became smarter that me 💀
Вся математика за 14 минут
真的是太牛逼了
Bro made math fun to watch
cmon I had never seen something so funny abt math. this dude made from math a masterpiece
please make more
So for those who want to know what is the giant thing at the end it is basically all of the basic numbers = numbers before infinity
math action movie
Seeing this gives me flashbacks of AP Cal 🫠
THIS IS LEGENDARY... THE RESULTS, THE SOUND EVERYTHING
10:02 wheaaaaaaaa
I feel like it can become a teaching material for the one who new to learn math. Especially kids
Math teachers:
Who is the most evil math character?     The sine function.
not only this is epic, but also entertaining.
Highly impressive🔥💛
Wow.....This all started from a number.
man when will we know TSC’s kill count
what happened to the animation

Students : Math sucks and it’s irrelevant  Orange : Die math die! Professors : *Takes years to get a scholarship once they first started learning  Also orange : Einstein 2.0
10:02.....yup that's what maths sounds
Mathematics is a universal language, and everyone can understand it.
If math was like this I would like it more
so this is why orange is so smart

What is that big thing at the end?
Very nice
I'm just here wondering what exactly the "exponential" did to the dude to warrant this hatred🤣🤣🤣

This is cool
I think if you make a game app similar to this animation I think it's great, starting from a 1+1 can be a variety of formulas that exist in this world

I recently went on a nostalgia spree and have been updating myself on the whereabouts of Terkoiz, from all those RHG animations back in the day. Its great to see that he actually ended up as a head on an animation team like this! Still putting out great videos too.  Will always be sad he never gave his RHG legacy his own send-off, but this is a great thing for him! Hope he keeps it up!
The laser was so powerful it broke reality out of it.

This is stunning!  Only last weekend I was trying to explain Eulers identity to someone (unsuccessfully), but next time I can just send them a link to this! Even if they don't get the maths, maybe they'll understand a bit of how cool maths is.
Anyone here keep coming back?😂
Bro sed if you hate math then beat math
orange it,s so smart
Great story btw
He should be happy he didn't fight x or y😂
Also why does this man alan have no money every vid
I am just saying he should be a math techer or something like that
some of this is too complex for me
Same @godwin972
Should do animation vs terraria
Então é isso que IA anda fazendo por aí. Agora estar tudo explicado.
What if... E=mc²🥶
You lost me at that part with all the numbers in it.

Have anyone told you that you're brilliant? It is amazing!!
you don't need subtitles on this 😂
delightful.... and i dont even like math....

8:31 this one moment there was tan but then that turned into =f(•)
7:11 i like how they mentioned cos(π)+isin(π)=e^iπ
3:20 from this point i don't understand
Bro made maths fun
This guy needs an Oscar 👇
the fact that i only understood everything until 3:10
Even though I don't understand, this fight is epic

The next one should be about true coding, maybe with Yellow.
i wanna see orange with math vs red with minecraft creative
so we got to calculus from the equation 1+1
Where’s YouTube?
How Math Teachers expect to learn:
Amazing 😮
but the real question is, HOW DID TSC END UP IN MATH WORLD IN THE FIRST PLACE???
Your aimmmmmmm
you should make a game about this exact animation
Ok wow
0:18
Take some notes teachers. Maybe you can actually make us interested with these kinds of animations
Это великолепно
This is how I want math to work just fight for your life and make up with each other at the end and get some friends

Это видео действительно замотивировало учиться)
Part 2 pls
Do pt2
TSC describes us from elementary school to high school in math. Euler it's just like final boss of high school Math. Euler that removes TSC from math dimension can be said TSC have graduated from high school and TSC is like not majoring in mathematics. Because right after TSC comes back, many formulas will get more complicated.

This animation has potrayed the beauty of math amazingly
This Made Math Fun, Thanks To You Alan, Btw I Loved Your Vids Since 3 years
I wish next vid is gonna be Animation Vs Vietnamese but it’s probably not gonna happen any time in the future
Imagine a game like this where it uses like ai and stuff and you can actually pull numbers apart and stuff. I think it would help so many kids learn math.
=f(∞)
bro made 14 minutes into 2
This is amazing 😂😂. I like it, bro.. damn. I hope you can show us more animation loke this. With physics, chemistry, or biology.
What's the theme of this?
The fact that it's actually teaching me about math
This is like dark and depressing

Bro made math fun XD
Someone should make this into a vr game
🥳☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️🙂🙂🙂😀
as a mathematician, i can confirm this is true.
Ha.. I don’t understand anything past square roots. I still watch this cause you made it so cool.
there should actually be a game about this with bosses weapons enemies and everything
It is absolutely crazy to see, how well done this animation really is, and that Alan becker needed an entire team to finish it nice and quickly. Rather then just taking time to work on it all by himself
the e can start a world war
gerai priderinta muzika prie animacijos ':)

Fun fact: Alan has more subs than the gangam style man
Is CRAZY AND IS SO COOL
So, pi is splitted into cos and sin.

Lets just say that we should call Second Coming in terms of math class
Not a orange figure smarter than us in mathematics
I like how they use the math as weapons😊
He Knows what he's doing 3:39

This is really good concept of how it feels to understand math
Alan becker called us dumb in 369 languages

how does this have more likes than animation vs minecraft season 3
Orange learns entire of math in 10 minutes meanwhile most people be taking 12 years ☠️
he did create infinity but I heard there's something called absolute infinity its the omega sign for some reason
Wait but TSC was catched with TCO by these agents, what if this was a simulation?
◍
This is perfect Just perfect
One word. Amazing
Can we take  moment to appreciate this art❤
U literally taught years of math in 15 minutes.
This was incredible
He's finding the answer to life. 🥺
This means ornage is a mathematical genius
1+1=?
1m + 1m = 2m
1×=1
🎉🎉❤❤ hapy
If math was good
A fun way to teach math
damn
Question : Prove   e iπ = -1 Answer   :
Actually what's the value of ie^iπ?
21+3-34%/8=127
1+2=3
It's amazing to watch and super enjoyable, the simple environment with the animations. it makes math so much classier !
Alan able to make math cool
This dude passed math class
Well that was Awesome!!!!!!!!
Bro became the modern Albert Einstein 💀
Bro can you also do physics and science vs animation
I feel so smart being able to follow this
heyyo wtf
Вот что значит: знания сила!
crazy
Alan did his homework
need more animation vs  one of all branch of science.?
Does the circle that sc uses to blast a beam remind anyone of the death star?
"a matemática pode ser divertida" -pessoa que nao é o professor de matemática 2023
This is a great way to learn math
I wouldn't think that i might learn some math from this... i literally learned a lot of new thing!
perfect!

What a great ending
Just realised something ORWNGE HASN'T LEARNT VOLUME YET HOW IS HE GONNA USE MATH IN A 3D WORLD?
conclusion: math is bad
Sequel

Bro used math to create an anime 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 this man needs to have a noble prize 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wow
BRO, NOT KIDDING,  I legit learnt the "to the power of ()" stuff in like seconds, and I'm questioning myself how I'm having fun with math
now imagine animation vs geometry
Imajiner😅
fighting with math alone with dark screen . animation is smarter than me think !!!!!!!! yo :)
:(
play with math in dark screen
he's alone
This is what your teachers meant when math is everywhere. It’s even in art.
someone needs to make the math thing into a website
Are you a math pro alan because your amazing
How do you know all of this this is hard your viewers cant even knkw this you smart nice
Wonderful
You should make an Animation vs. Math II!

Really cool!
Imagine getting A's on your math tests because of this
Have you ever thought math could be so fun?
The largest collab from Alan ever
albert einstein si hiciera videojuegos
TSC could eventually make a game or something with all those numbers
for thoose who dont know: the + end = the end
bru the first problem wrong 1+1=11 but all else right is this like canon stuff
I stopped watching it for to long I can’t catch up on everything
Astounding, astonishing, epic. Bravo!
I think Orange and The Chosen One would make a great team against the math enemy
Amazing m
His nonexistent brain is growing
This is cinema
😮
13:37 zoophile enter
well, 1+1=10 haha
how about animation vs english?
Absolutely a masterpieces

ой, интегралы... не люблю их
Wow
aleph is a big letter i end
I got a complete revision on complex numbers
Make me wanna study maths (I hate it)

Story are compelling, from random complex numbers appearing then return to basic multiplication. 😂 e to the power I phi
e theta root2 root 3 In2 ex thetan = 7-5
I bet the hardest part wasnt animating
Now we want physics vs animation
Bro makes boring stuff fun
0:13 refl instant

We think the maths are bored but not alan, alan can make all funny
While drawing these, you need to get tired and have intelligence on them.
We’re going to infinity with this one
Betiafull
ахиреть можно
Animation vs. Physics/math. Would get very interesting when on macro or micro (quantum especially) levels.
It's einstein
From the beginning to the end, it runs through the imaginary number i
Ive gain 80 IQ just from watching this thatnks alan :)
this has taught me more about math than school
why does school not show us this
No way TSC actually drew a perfect circle
This was amazing! Can you do this with ELA, or maybe science? It would be cool to see an animated version of Einstein or Schrödinger or Shakespeare and see how the orange guy interacts with them, learning new things about the topics and exploring new concepts and phenomena.

Man really upped his audio department. Watching this with headphones was epic
The creativity is actually insane, like, who would think of 2x2 flipped onto itself as being a bow!?!?! Especially with 4 as the arrows, it makes sense!
I just subbed, remember watching you when I was 7 :)
Epik.
Nice :D
im both losing braincells and amazed at the same time
I am currently studying consumer mathematics. I feel like the little stick guy fighting math.
Good job doing math
Me on exam
I want The - End Now!

This Man have a power to know all thing more than human 💯
this is why they say you will use math in the furture
The aleph at the end is terrifying! Like seeing UY Scuti !

What is 1+1?
The quiz be like:
Next vs physics and chemistry pls hehe
👏👏👏👏
Good
This is the only math i will be accepting from now on
I think what the special thing about this animation is that you feel like the lil match man is like the entire human history in math: discovering new concepts and using them. That gives me a lot of goosebumps
Only time I've ever enjoyed numbers 🤠
Thanks!
this music slaps ngl
cant wait for the animation vs physic
I learned math better from this vid than school
Finalmente matemática serviu pra alguma coisa

this is crazy!!! i almost thought he woud die😬
Merkabah ❤
episode 7 is taking so long to animate that the orange stickman reinvented all of math waiting for it to release
Their reactions imply that before this Orange didn't know how to count.
9:56 🗿🗿🗿☠️☠️🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶
Missed the trick of flipping the 'i' to create factorials ✨😅
jesse we have to solve the quintic

Learning math only 14 minute 😱
This is the most mind blowing scientific animation I have watched
I request for you, animation vs :  Chemistry Physics Economy Biology  Etc
How About Fisika
What.
If learning math was like this it would be too good
Animation vs physics?
What if they made a math pvp game like this, similar to bed wars or something,meaning there is something they have to acquire from the other team, or make it battle royale where all players try to get to one objective
Bro i took only 14 min to understand all of it💀
I remember Youtube has comment here
Damn that look like a matrix but in maths
Teacher:what is your power? Alan:math
Bro is learning math faster than me
数学強い()
Stop adding more
Let’s see how the second coming is going to explain this to the rest of the stick figures
1+1 é Deus 2depois dos discípulos volta a Deus 1 e conhece Deus 0

I have never found math to be so fascinating until now.
what if there was alluc nole number there
Матема́тика (др.-греч. μᾰθημᾰτικά[1] < μάθημα «изучение; наука») — точная формальная наука[2], первоначально исследовавшая количественные отношения и пространственные формы[3]. В более современном понимании, это наука об отношениях между объектами, о которых ничего не известно, кроме описывающих их некоторых свойств, — именно тех, которые в качестве аксиом положены в основание той или иной математической теории[4].

OwO
Animation vs art please
I’ve never loved something I understand so little of.
Wow is col 😲
I like how the *e* thing says goodbye to the stick man
I have never been interested in math before... I wish this is used in schools to start students into understanding math.  I loved this and now I wish to learn more of what I have seen because I understood half of it.
Excellent.
4:40  Fighting a minus with a plus 😂

I don't know what I just witnessed but it was beautiful
Mza nnhi aya
12:34 e tried to power 4i for 4dimensions, but failed becos they are simply on planes. So instead they used the circle which are actually coordinates, n wrapped TSC infinitely, n finally inverted him!!
Day 2 of asking for a new member pink
Someone should make an app or game like this
Formule Gun xd
This is crazier than Whitebeard fighting the World Government in One Piece
Can you do a sequel?
Epesode 2
Animator vs animation 🥺
This guy just taught me more about math in less than 20 minutes.
🤯
गजब
5:59 Or
Dude really just made math fun
This taught me more than school
Bro is this a marvel movie
God I wish we could learn like this, by making neat weapons for mathematical battles using cool formulas, like the dope science simulations online.
Pov your angry at error
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
I never thought math is so interesting
cant wait for animation vs meth
It would be great if purple and orange went back in season 4 or 5
Show this to any kid and they’ll think math is the coolest thing ever!!! I also feel like I just learned the meaning of the universe in 14:02 minutes!😂
The last behemoth in the background is aleph-0.

The good ending
Bro just made the perfect circle
i×i×i=?
Is no one gonna talk about how he played with that one? 2:06
MTK diluar otak manusia
Going by far in time, I can confirm that I have been inspiring from this man since I started drawing...  Good thing I'm not as good as him
I wish math was this fun, then I'd actually wanna learn it more
Esta epico ojala aya segunda parte
Alen you some how made math look FUN
*_BRO, THIS ANIMATION IS OSCAR LEVEL_*

The “TSC” is really smart to learn math🎉
I don’t need school anymore because I learned everything I need to know from a orange stick figure guy.
Solo así me darían ganas de estudiar matemáticas
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF ART I HAVE EVER SEEN
Me at school using a calculator:
Besuty of math I guess
This is so interesting ngl
Want from 1+1 to that💀
What about black stick man vs king orange?
When will animator vs animation 7?
Me gaining every braincell in the world while watching this: THE PROFECY IS TRUE.
Title: "Sparky: Light of Energy"  Act 1: Opening and Attack  In the city of Stickville lives the stickman Sparky, who has an unusual ability - he can accumulate energy inside his body and release it in the form of powerful light. One day, after successfully demonstrating his ability at a local fair, Sparky becomes the target of attention from other stickmen. The members of the mysterious "Darkness" clan believe that his light may threaten their power.  14 stickmen from the clan attack Sparky, trying to overwhelm him and learn the secret of his ability.  Act 2: Escape and Meet Orion  Sparky barely survives the attack and decides to seek help. He meets an old stickman named Orion, who also has an extraordinary ability - the ability to control energy. Orion takes Sparky under his wing and begins teaching him how to control his power and use it to protect himself and others.  Act 3: Preparation and Return  After intense training, Sparky feels ready to return and take on the Dark Clan. He gathers allies among other stickmen who have also suffered from the criminal activities of this clan.  Act 4: The Final Battle  Led by Sparky, the allies travel to the Dark Clan's secret league compound, where a major battle takes place. Sparky uses his light to destroy barriers and support his team. During the fight, Sparky decides to focus all his energy to create a powerful explosion that scatters the opponents.  Act 5: Charging the Laptop  After defeating the Dark Clan, Sparky feels exhausted from using his ability on the edge. He returns to his workshop table, where his laptop is lying - a key tool in his life. Exhausted but determined, Sparky concentrates the last of his energy to charge his laptop and reconnect with his allies and friends.  Epilogue: New Beginnings  The scene ends with the cityscape of Stickville, where Sparky, reconnected, communicates with his friends via laptop, celebrating the victory over evil and channeling his energy into supporting and developing his home community.  This script explores themes of friendship, self-improvement, and using one's abilities for good.
Лучшее, что я видел!
Music is spot-on!

This legit makes me want to learn math
That's what I think in math class😂
Òwó
You need to make a Episode 32 of Animation VS Minecraft. Make a scene where all the stick figures fix the Minecraft machine with the broken portal.
Dude learned math faster than I've learned how to use fork and knife
The E was scared because idk anymore
Orange got smarter every second
Thats how to teach kids with teacher alan
AvA eps 2
What if the powers of the main stickmen (ie; Red, Blue, Yellow, Green and The Second Coming) are just fundamental school subjects

That's very beautiful!
This needs like 10 games, 3 books, a Netflix series, a movie on Disney+ and Dreamworks, and way more
Wow! This is honestly the most engrossing math-related thing I've ever seen! I didn't want it to end!
this might be the only way that i could remember math

For the power of prosthaphaeresis!
Ты самый плохой ютубер в мире Ты меня достал
Bro have 1000000000000000 IQ
Even a fictional stickman is smarter than Elon musk
alan becker never ceases to amaze me
This is incredible, actually making a movie out of math itself
Multiverse of Mathness
That is a hell of a way to blast through mathematical problems... And glad to know I was not the only one who had existential issues with "e"...
and why i learned of this more than school?
alan i have a question u made it in adobe animate cc?
The moral of the story is: don't mess with Euler's identity.
That's Boring.. 🙃
This is how they get more and more smarter lol
Your animations are complete 💩!!!😂😂😂
Why did you stop making animation on PC?
e^iπ
数学は嫌いだ！！！！
1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=11ワケワカメ

I like this alan beckers about ♈♌♐♎ and ♉.
It reminds me of original Tron 😁
OK
I never thought that math could be entertaining.
Orange was trying to go home
I have no idea what's going on but I'm entertained.
Turned into death star
It is here
How to the second coming born now
Amazing!!
This is original version of calculator but with good ending that got deleted cuz its was impossible to beta testers
I know the ending will be sad😭😭😭  Either They have a happy end with Alan and they have done there job as a person and as an animation👏👏👏🎬  Or  The stickman's will be deleted cause they have done there job as an animation Alan will be in peace.

Everything just a match like touhou! Do you know touhou?! Be honest.!
This is how math is for me in school At first it was kinda fun and easy to get and then it became like war
Pov математика 11 класа
What was it i can't understand

.
Ultra low quality
This is what Richard Watterson felt when playing calculator
oh I very much like this.
this is geniunely making certain math concepts clearer to me as I watch this.

why is it satisfying
mu noy is do smart that hes breaking time. rn
didnt know orange was this smart
Becker plz add the ep 32
That was amazing
Maybe we can watch animation vs physics in future 😂

Eu estou perdendo meus neurônios enquanto assisto isso, não sou muito de exatas..
Awesome!
Alan faz o animation vs Minecraft mods
Do animation VS Roblox plz
The Question is: "Animation vs Bubble Bobble... and Sonic!" when?  Bubblun intentionally calls TSC "Jay T" while Talking (in TTS; Unexpectedly Enough, TTS Ivy will be Bubblun's Voice Actor).
Я начал тупить когда пошли комплексные числа))) А так понятно)
Jay T gets Stuck in a Calculator Mainframe, challenges a Math Equation in a Duel! This is caused by "Calculator Fight!" from Betrace, in which is Made into "Unexpectacy I" from Pizza Tower
me watching, purple just watch his family had me crying.
Since you did animatjons vs minecraft.. how bout you do animations vs roblox

what a nice
They should make this into a game.
bro is now a teacher
that was powerful cool
can we appreciate how much he studied just for an animation?
So...if you want to be animator like Alan Becker you need to know math this far...😅
Absolute masterpiece

Wow i live it
Dippid can voice over to this
Animation Vs chess

Everyone is talking about the Giant Math Monster but no one is talking about how wholesome 13:31 is.
this is what happens when you do mental math
Why are you making math fun
Plot twist: What if orange was testing a game Alan got
10:02 “Waaaaaa!”
Math is amazing!!
do it, animation vs general relativity
Bro you should do more math related content!!!!!!
Bro was just trying to learn math
This Alan Becker is ABSOLUTELY GENIUS
Je n'y comprends que dal mais génial. Enfin je veux dire que sur le plan de la conscience j'ai pratiquement tout pigé.
infinity is not the end it will never be an end it will always be infinitely as infinity long it can be.
He Einstein
Only Alen Becker can make math look interesting and fun
If you divide by 0 the number is unknown
He learned more math in 14 minutes than I have in 14 years Also, we need more math videos. This was so much better than I thought, and I already had high hopes
Yo alan becker can u make an animation for phiplipines😅
Que animação incrivel tá de parabéns gostei muito.😃😃😃

Нихуа толком не понятно , но страшно интересно)))
Alan Here's a video idea->Orange Still Thinks about his son so he decides to go back for him and he want the most help he could so he could maybe do it faster after a while they give up but king orange doesn't so the others say we tried let's go home but king orange refuses so he just tries on his on and eventually breaks in but it's all black so he asks yellow to borrow his staff and yellow says yes and king orange cleared it out and his son is knocked out on the ground so he brings him home and after a bit he wakes up and orange is so happy that he is back then he introduces his son to the others and they all got along together. And alan if you do end up doing this thank you so much Alan bye!
john wick orange man
ORNGE NOW HAS LOGIC HES SMART FINALLY HE HAS A PERSONALITY THEN JUST SLEEPING HES NOW A NERD IN THE GROUP
Could there be an Animation vs. Scott Pilgrim?
Fun fact: in 10 months this might have 1 billion views
You are legit my favorite YouTuber your content is amazing keep up the good work.
Animation vs terms of service
It feels like in the "Wanted" series, orange somehow gets into the math world and this series is from there. BUT THIS IS AWESOME!
You must add the kings son back
bro it’s really becoming a teacher💀
our life in one video
@alanbecker wow
whats the name for the giaant number monster
Definitive proof that letters on math was a mistake.
Когда новое видео ? Я знаю ты знаешь русский
what if this were to happen again but with yellow, blue, green and red and  e wasn't able to bring them home for whatever reason
Very math
Looooo
Nah SC making his smart moment 💀💀💀
I hate how he learns math itself in 14 minuts
make a whole long video of how the adventure of all stick man went. Demones pozdrawia 😈
So crazy
Interesante
Está padre
Bro made math into a superpower 11:06
Why did you show "א"
2
א
He teach us whole maths while we enjoying his animation lmao
10:33 now bro got the Death Star made only of math equations
9:30 bro changed shells to the infinite buckshot
Alan can make anything entertaining
10:33 pov: me tries =f (•) with cos and isin:
This is something else, mind blown 🤯. Seeing concepts like this in an animation is lovely and it is well expressed. Tbh this is better than some movies lol
I Have Stole Your Idea Alan Becker, NOW YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO UPLOAD NOW, I DID NUMBER LIFE
I think alenbecker should do rainbow friends with the stick figures!!🎉
I think you guys should make a New series: animation and minecraft its just like avm but with king orange and purple🤔🤔

This is the first time when I enjoyed mathematics😂😂😂  Great work btw 🎉🎉❤❤
Sorry late for something, this is one question, why don't before eps30 yellow not /gamemode @e c so nobody will dies or stole the minecraft.
At 9:06 shouldn't the radiant be in 90° to the circle?
bro has iq ℵ0
it would be even cooler if there was a small battle of opponents, whom the chosen ones with his friends
Caution of adding the √π×¶
Alan Becker is this part of animator vs animation and this is the second coming while he’s frozen
Did he retire?🤔🤔🤔
Alan your tired of creating these animations?
Ассалаумағалейкүм Алан аға, сіз қазақсыз ба?? Мен сіздің фанатынызбын😊😊
this animation explained for me more,than school in 11 years
when math starts attacking you physically and mentally
i always knew letter in math were evil
I believe that yellow should probably hold the power of math because of his intelligence I believe it suits him
Best video ever
can you try to make a colabe withe prestonplays
Why teachers can't teach like this
At 10:38 I was like, is this the Death Star or what?
And that's how Greece and the US are friends
Alan Becker amazes me that he captures the beauty and wonder of "Mathematics" which is simple but very complex, in a short 14-minute animation.
Вау..
Made the animator vs animation Vl part 2
My brain when there are an easy test:
Bro made me get a A+ after this vid😭😭
bro, please! make this a series
Best animator ever👍
I feel like there will eventually this massive battle between The Dark Lord and Alan's stick figures, and all the characters like purple, king orange, the math characters and all the minecraft mobs & other game characters.
Alan Becker, can you make "Animation vs Geometry dash"
I want animation vs animator vi ep 2
eπ• is like what or something like I dunno is like... Orange enemy😮
Do more of this
Alan has the most interesting yet coolest imagination
Bro made math fun and also I learned more of math in this video than school
I love math after seeing this masterpiece ❤
It amazed me
This animation taught me more about math than school.
cool
The video that da boys learned math from
😳😳😳👀👀👀😳😳😳
The Second Coming literally advanced quicker than Albert Einstein💀💀
I love how tsc used the plus as a cross against tbe e, lime it wss some demon(which does describe math as a whole.)
I just learned division just by watching this 🤣🤣🤣
Way better than school
I got smarter watching this
I'm pretty bad at math, so I didn't understand most of what was going on in this video. But I just love how TSC found out how to take numbers, letters, and shapes, and somehow turn them into extremely destructive weaponry.
Bro found the secret to the universe
This should be a video game.
It's got confusing after 1=1
mdss mt bom, esse cara e um genio ;o;
Alan Becker u know desktop goose? Then do animation vs desktop goose
That was an interesting math lesson. I regobized almost all the concepts shown
Did euler just kill that man
What e ?🧐🧐🤨🤨🤨
Lol
Why does this give me Avengers End Gane Vibes
I already like learning about math in school, so I already understand some of the things here, but seeing it like this is just way more cool! I really wish school had a better way of getting people interested in a subject, which is hard I know, however with the right kind of person anything can be interesting! Fantastic work on this Alan!
Alan theirs someone called Alan something official is that yours cause they are reposting clips and entire vids
Mad respect for him having to learn the math to make this vid
Dude my friend always calls you Alan Baker
Richard watterson playing calculator (expert mode)
"Las matemáticas son aburridas"  Alan todo un csm:
I love these animations, I'm Brazilian but I grew up watching this channel, my name is Giovanna (Italian name) and I admire this channel, congratulations.
I understood nothing of this video, but i love it
They should do a second one and explore more mathematical stuff examples: Meters, Mass, KM, hours etc
Good thing I had a b in math
Aleph on the background is so freaking big
So. Sad. 😢
О БОЖЕ ОБОЖАЮ ЭТОТ КАНАЛ!!!!❤❤❤
you shod make animation vs math part 2
ways to learn math easier
TSC really got stuck in Alan’s Calculator
1=1 1+1=?
Video of the year easy
Вау
The end made me cry😢😭
i was stucked at 1 + 1 but animation was great :D
If they do this in math class I’d go to math class every fucking day 😭😭😭😭
I knew right up to the ending. It took me a long time to find an explanation that included mapping imaginary space onto Euclidean space. I may have gotten lost for a bit after integrals came onto the scene. I'm not sure whether those sine waves were phasor phasers or something to do with quaternions. I don't think I was quite following the dimensionality.
9:50 is the most op
I can’t believe bro made math fun
this hurt me in a way
My boi be learning math dawg.
I just saw an ad of alan talking to DJ about a game called watcher of realms 💀
You’re better than any other animator I’ve ever seen so figure animations are my favorite kind of animations in the way you make them so smooth it’s like how do you do it
masterpeice❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
100% Entraining 100% Learning 100% Funny 100% Cool Story 100% We did not asked but we need it 100% Perfect
This video taught me way more than my math teacher 😂
Animation vs. Trombone Champ?
Can you help kids with maths in their academics?
Few things capture the beauty within math's depiction of sterility as this
Amazing animation and storyline, bu sadly, it doesn't make me like math anymore than I had when I was younger LOL And btw why is Animation Guy always picking fights with everyone LOL
day 1 of asking:  you need to make a program that has these guys running over are screens it would be funny
If i were you,i would make animations,mixing naruto(shipudden,the last,boruto),my hero academia(boku no hero academia),with virtual things and reality,and parallel universes,
😮1+333×66÷999=?
Part 2 wanted
See, math CAN save your life
bro said stickman is enough, time for math
This is the most insane thing ever!
wow
Worlds longest math
He is a genous also
Good 🔥
What they show in math class: the video What i remember: the thumbnail
What a greatfull video! I am crazy about your videos, Alan Becker!
Матимака - это сила. Math is power.
This would actually make a good video for something like the Voyager Space probes to prove to Aliens that find it the fact that we know the universal language of math.
alan Becker bisa bikin lagi
Vid Idea: Animation vs Minecraft (aka Animation vs Dream)
Imagine a game like this 😅 ot would help young children in a fun way solving problems or learning basics of maths .
Hey Alan Becker when are u Ganna put ep. 2 of the men that is trying to hunt the chosen one?
It's the best motion graphic video I've ever seen!!
ORANGE HAS FOUND THE X!!! AFTER DECADES THE X HAD BEEN FOUND!!!

The animation in this is amazing
Hey alan, i have a question forr you Your stick man(orangae, red, yellow, greed, blue,) who is boy and who is glir?
Dude just transformed math into a dark soul battle
A missed opportunity to put "=The End" but this video is still awesome
This should be a game!
Plis kembalikan adik dari king oren😢😢😢
Alan. Can you give me membership for free?
My brain hurt much
Who new someone could make math fun..!
It’s better than schools
The most beautiful equation be like:
Alan becker stickers
He was a good friend all along :)
I am sad to say I don't understand why e^iπ multiplied by i opens a door?
bro he become Albert Einstein 💀💀💀💀
:o one day i will be an animator like you :D you inspire me so much!
Anyone else noticed the mighty Aleph Null walking with the group at the end there?
1+1=2
My Brain in a math lesson:
His Crush:  "I wonder how he got so smart.." Him:
I didn't understand anything but i really enjoyed it.
I actually wanna Show this to a Math Teacher to See how they React to this XD
Alan Becker I like this episode and this actually made me a LOT smarter
I came back to see whats up after a few years. You made 1 year of my still-going childhood and it seems like you got better since the time this started in the 2010s(when they got introduced and fought you) so remember me and i think im gonna watch your channel more
In my entire life only this time math looks so cool 😎
Blud realy remade the deathstar jedis are dead💀
Teachers beware
Wow, Orange learned Math faster than me
I'm literally procrastinating about my math homework as a watch this 😅
ON.tyu.uwuwf
This thing is master piece
Alternative title  Oppenheimer but less explosions
It is shocking how this got 25m+ views in a MONTH.
óï áòεóοìεèφ
Я думаю будет переводчик к этому комментарию: Стикмен: научился математике за 1 видео. Я: не могу научиться математике за 11 лет.
Bro is gonna make stick vs animation and make it amazing
still somehow more entertaining than actual math class
He woke up and this all happened!
Mira chavito, esto es animación bien hecha 😎
Alan Becker is a very talented person who can make amazing videos
I love how it slowly gets more difficult math, as if hes going through school in 12 minutes
13:25 goodbye orange
for anyone curios about the ℵ at the end, its called aleph null, counting each number.
13:25  e is press
13:15 hole white
10:28 e titan
"Now its time for everybodys favorite subject. Math !"
Bro is me with my homework
All I can say about this video is that it's so good it's like a PORTAL game that makes you want to escape or get out.
1+1=2
Ə: ⅘ STICKMAN: BORRACHA
Hello❤👍👍
Bro learns better that me💀             I got beaten by a stick figure😭
WOW
It’s amazing how as the video goes on, the math becomes a new topic and a new level and age. For example the beginning of the video starts off with simple 1+1, the basics and the first things young ones will learn. It continues to get more and more difficult as the video goes on! For me I capped out at about 5:20
This is only my lest favorite because it has math in it
Hey man how do you Make these Animations
dont talk to me, im watching Animations vs. Math
matamatik hocasının benden beklediği perfomans
This is great.  Great animation.  If I were a teacher, I would show it to my students because it's great.  This is a compilation of his elementary and secondary math classes into one of his 14 minute video!!!
I feel that I have increased my intelligence after watching this. 🤔
Didn't know math was this cool maybe all go back to 3rd grade after 37 years
Well, I am too dumb for this
Hi Allen Becker when i grow up i will make something kinda like yours i hope it’s 👌 ok
WE ALL NEED A SEASON 4 episode 2
Marvel need this man
Hey Alan I need to ask something to you what’s the gender of the characters
the gun: =ʃ(•)
Теперь я знаю, как сделать так,чтобы мои дети полюбили математику
If that’s a real game/app that’s would be so cool
Please put the second part too, it's very beautiful❤
Y nunca se pudo dividir entre 0
If learning math was this fun, I wouldn’t hate it
Yo me quedé sin entender ningún calculo matemático pero la animación me pareció épica 😂
Math lore💀
Me: Impressed  Viewers: Impressed          Albert Einstein: Depressed
You are so noob
This just shows how hard math actually is lol
i felt immense fear and dread watching this
I hate learning math. I really wish it wouid be this easy like in the video
근의 공식: x=2a/-b ±√b² -4ac
Animation vs quantum physics pls
❤
Wow so crazy the last one is my fav ❤
Ya entiendo porque Richard se entretenía tanto jugando a la calculadora
Never thought I'd enjoy math so much!
yoo becker you dont have new videos part 2 for the animation vs math?
This man deserves more than 30m subscribers and Oscar for doing good animation like this
1+5😂
The best video I have seen in the last time!
Wait. I never noticed the giant aleph null at the end
Extreme logic
How is this math
Bruh if I see TheSecondComing using math against the whole stick man animation world, I have nothing to say but he would easily kill even Alan becker human himself because of how math controls the technology itself.
this video has taught me a lot and the 2 things that interest me the most is that math is very mysterious and it's super strong
Tuy hơi hại não nhưng nó rất hay và trắt tốn nhiều thời gian và công sức của ad r 🎉🎉🎉
Okay
数学の勉強もっとしておけばよかったな
MY BRAIN IS BURNING WHERE IS WATER
eiπ™
Aí mano cadê as outras animações você tá fazendo o quê Avon faz animação é tão bonito a gente falando gravou o vídeo a gente tentando falar eu gosto de bonecos😢😢 voz valor animação😢😢😢😢😢😢
I just learned a lot of math
Bro turned my greatest fear into my favorite subject:)))
Can you make animation vs stardew valley?
겁나 수학적이다
The math is hard😂
i like how the Phi symbol walking with the speed of fibonacci sequence in decending order
@alanbecker : Have you ever thougt about doing this on a 360 degrees fulldome screen? It would be great to show at a planetarium as any intro or something.
This was way more entertaining than any of the Marvel movies released over the past years (and i'm not a math nerd at all)
hi
The bleaved one scyan colour
at 10:59 he turned into mini star into death star
Why dud i read animation versus meth
dude this is just insane, ppl who dont love math should watch this
part 2 pls
Amazing work!
No
Onon
Orange is me
Why does this feel like a game like orange from level zero all the way to level 1000😂😂😂
Wow just WOW this is awesome i dont know how to say this emotions but this is very cool
Я в шоке анимация против математеки

It’s all starts with 1…
(+)(-) fight part most cute part duality everywhere....
and one video place youtube
I love zero more ....
The second coming is going to be a mathecian.
Ei Alan pega você é ótimo animador, você fez o laranja fazer amigos da amigos de matemática de equação, você merece o like nunca desista da animação versus Minecraft, e também se continuar assim todo mundo vai adorar e amar você, e você sabia que o lançou a nova atualização do Minecraft 1.20?, Com certeza se fosse fazer mais animações do que isso você vai ganhar muito mas muito likes mesmo, boa sorte meu melhor amigo 👍👍👍👍👍⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🌹🌹🌹
❤😂😮😊
Your Math revision
Listen​ to​ red​ sun​ over​ paradise while watching this, better​ than​ netflix👌👈😭
That was so satisfying. All i want now is Rick and Morty to use this in one of their episodes
OUR FACE IF YOU WHO DID IT YOU ARE A GENIUS WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE THE DOT OF THE i DO A MATH BUSINESS
math; the most convoluted anime ever
You can do animation vs mods
Helo, i like your videos
Tame waste😕
10:34 bro began his villian arc
How is a Stickman with no brain smarter then me
imagine if this is a video game
The little guy is so cuteeeee
U should do more vids like this ❤
My bro is now a siyentist
Anai paling banyak matematika saya kls4 jadi tau
It makes me more motivated to study, thank you for making this video🎉
Sos:)))
The animation is me messing with a calculator
Where is the New Animation VS Minecraft episode 32 We have already scored More than 50 Thousand likes
If we all saw all the stick man got a power I think green would have the strongest one
This is a masterpiece! Around the midpoint it begins to surpass my level of math understanding, so I'm a little lost after that. But I feel this is on the level of a Mozart Symphony.
My dumb ahh acting like I knew everything thing on there
Animation vs terraria quando ein?
took me 15 years to get all the references. truly a masterpiece of all time.
Can someone tell me what the giant at the end was ?
E lore
So basically, TSC Mathed so hard that he broke the Math-sphere
하
What is the animation software?
Hey Alan I wanted to put in a request on an animation, so I recently watched Batman versus superman, and I thought you could make that into a animation. Hear me out, this wouldn’t a huge series like your other stuff instead it would be just a cool animation. For batman you could chose blue he would make his suit and his weapons would be potions and his fist, he would kind of be like the witch. Now Superman orange in his super form, no more said. Ok setting a village a mugger villager grabbed a new iron pickaxe orange flew over grabbing the pickaxe and giving it back blue saw this and thought criminals need to be punished so he suited up and put them in a jail orange didn’t like that because he thinks jail is wrong. Then fight. Then just to be fair to fans if it suits u you can attach 2 videos to show who wins. This is just an idea love your content
Is nobody going to talk about these godlike sound effects? they're futuristic in such an interesting way!
I love math🗿❤
Sou brasileiro, estou encantado por essa animação, em meus 5 anos de enguenharia na faculdade, jamais tinha visto a matematica de uma forma tão divertida e interesante.  parabens essas animação é incrivel  I'm Brazilian, I'm enchanted by this animation, in my 5 years of engineering in college, I had never seen mathematics in such a fun and interesting way. congratulations these animation is amazing
my am brain hurt
What was that waaaaaa
bro just copy pasting
Нихрена не понял, но классно и интересно.
animation vs just cause series
Who would have thought that mathematics can be made into an action
Over 25 million views in a month!  Awesome
O está peleando con alguien?
Alan que le pasó al stickman negro? No enserio que le pasó se murio?
A negative place
This taught me more math than math class
You made math fun… I’m unsubscribing jk I actually really like this video so keep up the good work :)
wild
The 1 point was created our universe! Remember it!
>w<
God bless that nerd :)
Thank you for sharing this with the Internet
This is Really good...I don't know or like math that much but oh my, this is epic!!!
2+2 =  4. 😂😂  2bxz35
lets make this the most-liked video to do with math by a couple  trillion
This is how you make math fun and actually interesting!!!
Animation vs terraria!!  That would be a good idea
Wow just wow
he learned quicker than i learned in school
Esto es cine
Bro na, a stick man will be learning math faster then me
7: 00 Overall  is very  awesome  video
😮 8:39
3:38 √4=±2 *
11:17 mochi mochi no mi?
What a heeeeeell
Ur smart
7:53 ohh! A domian expansion
this is the only time id ever willingly watch a maths video💀
Bro learned more math than I did in 15 min 💀
Albegra
Start off with you know simple 1=1 to 1+1 and so on then we get this 10:32
Mathematical!
How math teachers learn math:
I hope u use this math weapons in other animation like  animator vs animation VI
1:24 Wha
And here I was thinking that this should’ve been yellows destiny 💀
2
I want you to make the stick man movie🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Delightful
Alan Becker i agree with you, and it is impressive how this stick man learns and fights math , goes to show that sometimes math can be very hard , but not for me
Your Stickfigure now is smart
easiest way to learn math
Woah... this took my breath away multiple times. <3
Dope and educational 👍
Love the feeling of this knowledge flowing through my head without leaving a trace :P
13:33 ζ ϕ δ א
Wow❤❤❤❤❤❤
7:35 ∑_n=0^∞ (iπ)^n/n!
My fav part was the 'great x' at the end lol kinda reminds me that the unknown quantity of almost every math problem is x
I think my brain getting smarter after this lol
1:39 eⁱᐢ
Is this like most boring video ever?
1:39 eⁱᣕ (works only in mobile)
After years of searching and a month of thinking, I'm sure now - I finally managed to find the best video on YouTube. Nothing better will ever be made, you can turn off YouTube now.
When yellow gets his hands on this...
Who said that math is boring?
11:26 ə^iπ
He have 1M IQ
Bring back bob
can u make an episode of bob coming back is sad :(
We want Wanted animation VI ep 2
Wow  🥹You are a true artist
Genius story line that made out of mathematical equations heros and tools and weapons and was very accurate even in the smallest detail, i loved it ❤
Better than Netflix movies  You should to be my math teacher
👍
That proves that orange  past the nerd level
🧡 Meraviglioso 🧡
This has to be the coolest animation I have ever seen.. It combines science and makes it leagues better.
Awesome~~~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Where is new video 😡😡😡😭

Animation vs stick war legacy
I have no idea what's going on, but your animation is just super awesome and cool + complicated. Keep it up :)
where does TSC went in the end?
bro imagine gettign brain damage from a stick figure (totally not me)
When was the subtitles back
Kids don’t listen to your math teachers watch Alan Becker do it for you in a 14 minute video
This is what all kids deal with at school 9:17
Half of the time I have no clue what is happening
It's really cool.
😊🥺😷😔🥺🙏🏻
Mental Abuse To Humans

こういうのめっちゃ好き
...jesus fucking christ my head hurts from just watching this
Я так и не понял почему тут только 23 миллионов подписчиков.
I now love math because of that video
안녕하세요
The subject that took us humans years to learn took him only 14 minutes to learn😭
This is now canonically the prelife and afterlife for stickmen. This story is depicting a strange glitch in Alan’s code: a mysterious “phantom memory” from a previous life of TSC’s; a life where TSC was just unwritten mathematical possibilities.
what is the last ones? ζ φ δ?
What math teachers expect from us:
Animation vs. Terraria
Alan its been 4 or 3 months please continue the ava i want to what happens tco please also is math in this video is a eimulation
Que nostalgia bro soy el único que habla español aquí pero unos de los únicos con infancia
Gonna show my kids this when they go to school
I love Alan becker
10:01 McAfee vs. 7yr old me’s free robux apps

helo Alan Becker
sparky marky
I used to hate math now I think I might like it
I know this lauguege its greece and USA
Video is look llike Christopher nolan have directed this video
I am in 9th grade, but found this kinda cool, so I'm gonna re-watch it when I'll be in college
How in the world did this (very wonderful) animation teach me more about math than school did in my entire high school life?  The boss fight is a little funny, to be fair
Most impressive animation i had ever seen Your the best
Tai chalao
I have been watching you for ten years and it is crazy to watch how far you have come
That's really Nice 👌👌👌👌👌👍
aleph came?!?!?!? 13:37
I think this is hard but me i know this
10000₫%🥶🥶🥶😨😨😨
Can you do victim again
When do you make ava VII?
feels like there's a story  a human discovers and plays around math real number thats makes sense in human eyes.  discovered something more than it. a new perspective. the other way around. new dimension/axis. the imaginary negative ones.  he mastered more maths on the process until he harnessed/control this imaginary thing (negatives,complex numbers and pi. naked to our own eyes type of entity) (which shows it can go around, shifts underground (portraying "-" y axis)   they made a deal and became friends. like a deal to never touch each other again or peace or something to part ways.  they part ways. and separated (like this human traveled/lived on other dimension) (apart/ away to these identity shown on the ending).   i guess maybe this human wouldn't tell his offspring all his knowledge and connections about these identity ( as part of deal to part ways)

Can't wait for tommarows video
I’d like to see a video with aleph null, would be cool
This video made me think that 1+1 is 11
This is the greatest movie I ever seen it's so cool 😁
so this is what goes on when "error" appears on my calculator
Amazing！
I lime how the stickfigures are just experts at everything
10:00
random person: zombies are coming run / math teacher: making ray gun with math
It looks like science
this is the best way to learn math
This is, no joke, the best film I have ever seen.  Please make a sequel I beg of you I genuinely grew up loving your vids and this is like, the best yet. Plz make more ❤❤
Is that Richard Waterson playing with the calculator?
Thats cool ❤
Cool animation
Just to think animator vs animation 1 was made like 12 years ago and then only 11 years ago the third one was made alan has come so far and we are pround of him
I am interesting with your course. do you still open the course?
what a fabulous video combining math and animation ❤
Solo son matemáticas, por que estoy temblando?

Einstein about to blew his mind if he's still alive and see this video
Hi bro, look, I have an idea for you. What if you make a cameo of fancy pants in a video of yours? It's a good idea, and you'll also have visits due to the nostalgia factor.
You smart!!!
This is the best video I have ever seen in my whole life.
5:00 I would play this game, I imagine as a metroidvania it would also make it easier for the player to understand and swap between different functions
Achievement: Make math look easy to do  TSC: “Nah Ima bout to make it a whole war”
Make a update if they added Faces
Hermoso
keep up the good work you are doing great!!
(1+1)
Wait what?!! -1 = e^i(pi)??
1+1+1+2=5
The roar is goofy
It's Just So satisfying 😊
21 salute to the man who calculated entire video at this Level 🔥
Somebody: "Math is boring".  Math:

I Sent This to My Math Teacher and She is Impressed😂😂
My brain hurts
all i know is that 9 + 10 = 21
My brain while taking a math test:
This looks like aliens invading you rocket ship and you have a back up turret (not at the start)
petition for alan becker to make an episode about ice and fire in minecraft ↓
An absolute animation masterpiece. Congratulations you should be extremely proud.
Can you do similar movie, but "Animation vs Biology"?
I am dying this is fantastic
2:49 The explanation here is super understandable
This is beautiful.
Pov when u know too much math
Pt: isso mostra o quão matematica pode ser dificil apartir do que aprendemos quando eramos crianças  En: this shows how difficult math can be from what we learned when we were kids
I won't lie, now that i watched this, i feel like i know less about math
Heya, Alan Quick question (PLEASE ANSWER!) Do you still use Adobe Flash/Adobe Animate? If not Then what animation software do you use? (and can i use it on pc?) EDIT 1: I forgot to ask if its free thanks and PLEASE answer!
my brain rn:🔥🧠🔥
Orange forgot to carry the one
so THIS is what my friends mean when they say "quick maths"
what i remember after math class :
Bro you blow up on entire world
Best animate ever❤
If math was just like this I would definitely do it
It’s cool bro  but I your fan!
TSC's head is a o or a circle
Think Alan Becker gonna make something new in 1 year or 2years and it had a name and great fighting
Bob...
10:02 “WAAAAAAEEEEEE”🔥🔥🗣️🗣️
I need animation vs newgrounds
This is arguably the greatest sci-fi movie of all time
when the video is so good ,but you don't have any idea about what's going on :
4:15 thats what it feels like first time learning trigonometry fr
As a math PG student I have to say... The whole thing is insannnnnnne...   Favourite: sound effects.
Where is grim’s number?
This is so cool

This is insane! Great job. I would love to see a version of this where all of our stick figure friends are in there
cos(π)+isin(π)=e^i(π)?
А как же избранный из предыдущего  видео когда уже ep2
ijust learned math by this video
bro animation and math are equal 💀
This is an example how math is still hard:
Matemática 2 o filme
Literally like watching a beautiful mind at work.
Do MATH and stickman vs *Science*
MAKE MOREEEEEEEE
Whose going to make a game exactly like this for me, so I can learn maths happily..
ها هلو
엄청 감동적인 영상이에요 ㅠㅠ
This was so confusing to watch at but so beautiful at the same time
Could you make another animation that would be like: animation VS physics or chemistry
The math homework we all needed
Hey Alan, how do you like the idea of "Animatoon vs Terraria"? I think a lot of people will like it!
thats so cool!
I don't know what is this *alien language* but the animation is interesting
That so cool you make that's was powerful
10:55 bro made the spirit bomb and combined it with a final kamehameha💀
My nightmares at 40° body temperature

i wish math was like that
Wow it is so so so cool🤯
What kids want math to be like other than boring.
Please bring in girl character
How Much smart you must be for making AN animation Battle about math? WOW, you are incredible
1 mounth leter video where
Toll, einfach toll ...
A small e has such a powerful ability, so how many are left...
no joke, i learned more from this than my 7th grade math teacher.. i’m not even trying to make a joke at this point.. i’m dead ass lol
TSC(the second coming)is even smarter than albert einstein in this animation,but he still not smart as math
Alan PLEASE WANT5ED ANİMATİON EP2 PLEASE
11:13 love this
We want part 2
Me when I see a calculator:
Do anyone got names for the stickmans?
Fcking awesome :3 rly nice job
I don't really understand anything past like a grade 11 math, but I have been trying to get back into it. But- what I think is really great is that while the real numbers are things (tools, weapons, platforms to fight on) the imaginary numbers are the ones with personality. Because they are complex. That's my very basic read of the commentary, and I think that's super charming
This convinced me subscribe...and I hate math.
Pov: you're albert einsten
Perfect.
I WANT EPISODE 2!!
Your the smartest person ive ever seen😅
99% learned for yt 1% from school or is it just me?
Beo gor his ass kicked by sum orange dude that just started learning matheven though hes math itsself
I like how this whole thing just started with the number one
I haven't done math in a long time so this looked like hieroglyphics. 9:46
Can add face at stickman cuz fan need it
Математика что рассказать
My mom tell me I can finally watch stick man then she skip all the fighting part and only give me the math part😢😢😢and that take 1 hour
You can never deafest math
How math tests will be done in 2079 be like:
seeing this makes me want to learn math ➗➖ idk why makes me curious?
If you guys have to guess who the strongest character was I would guess the guy because can’t he erase things because they are a drawing?
I would love to have what ever pc this is knowing I get lots of entertainment and my pc will always be fine if it’s not 5 Stickmen save it
Does nobody realize that they didn’t even post it anymore
7:30 fighters
This is literally straight up W I forgot i have a life just by watching this. The best animation, it even explained why 6÷0 is not possible that's just W goddamn i can't get over it
Never math was so fun like this
This should be the educational movie that students can watch at school. 🤓
Why am I understanding more about maths from the silly stickman video than I did in all of highschool
This needs to become a vr game
dark souls be like:
Когда отключили интернет, но ты вспомнил, что есть калькулятор:
Orange got math skills💀 and running skills💀
I passed my maths tests this genuinely taught me
Bro I think I understand more this than my math teacher explaining the test
nothing has ever hurt my brain more than watching this video, i feel like i learned more math from watching this that math clss
this just proves how easy math is compared to me barely knowing math
Ah yes, The game that was Richard watterson talking about, The *Calculator*
Meanwhile orange is trying to find the cure to cancer:
I just learned every single thing about math in 14 minutes
When the stick figure increases his leg speed with the multiplication sign, they should have instead used "++" as a programing joke
С==3
Bro that minus one got me in the end
Me asking myself when the f*ck I learned this
My math teacher explaining why i need math be like
no entendí un carajo, debe ser porque estaba en ingles.
I hate math but this is cool
Mi brane iz fryd
This video is the definition of "that escalated quickly"
As a current freshman in highschool, I can't understand this complexity of math.
10:02 that random scream had me dying idek why
Man drew a perfect circle
please come new episode very nice videos
i like how the bigger the number, the heavier it is.
That's How Math Can Be Fun

Animation vs math... The movie
Why is this well made
Wat do you use to animat im tring to become a animator
One question Alan, haven't you considered doing it Undertale style without voice but with text like you did in Animation va Animator IV with "The Second Coming"?
I like math because  math is very beautiful
I wanna see like a episode 2 about this
数学の総復習ができる！！最高の作品ですね！！
Как же это  великолепно
Art
Please part 2
I cried when the orange went away when the e was alone
This is one of the coolest videos I’ve ever had the pleasure of seeing.
This could be a puzzle stage in a game ngl
-=π
This will help me in the future
Wow
I was expecting yellow to come in and save him
Brabo de mais
I think i now understand/learned mathematics really like fully after i watched this video feels like i gained new knowledge fr thumbs up to you alan 😗👍
Please do animation vs roblox
This thing is absolutely amazing 😂😂  Just so perfectly executed on every level.   I'm wondering how many references I missed. As many as I was able to catch, I'm wondering how many I missed
What can I say. You are so good. That was really captivating
Mi profesor:vamos las matemáticas no son dificil  Las matemáticas:
10:02
This is one of coolest videos I've seen
Suggested: Animation VS code?
I didn't understand anything but it was Epic
Это гениально!
new
shown this to my math teacher and she got confused🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
-1^1/2=i
4^1/2=2
4^-1=¼
4⁰=1
6²=36
6+6=12=2(6)=12
=6÷0
0 -3 -3 6=6÷3
0 -2 -2 -2 6=6+2
6/2=3
12
1+1+1 +1+1+1 +1+1+1=3×3
--3=3
I learned much more from this less from math calasses in school ☕🗿
E is euler with formula
You deserve subtraction
You 100 heardinds
The fact that an animation is smarter than me
It's 20
Got it
1+1+1+1=4
Hey Alan Becker you should add faces soon because I’ll look better and the animation you done in the shorts are cool so yeah!!!!!!!!!
if there any video explained all of the math and historical reference in detailed manner, I would love to watch it even the video duration will be hours
The math started to get confusing around 0:18
This is what I meant by playing with my calculator
Math is hard.Everything you do with mathematics is harder,plus math can get impossible.
I love this animation it seems educational video too
So this is the game Richard played
❤
Add faces to the red orange green yellow and blue stick figures I really want it
This is already better than the Chapter3 season 4 end event lmaoo
Who does like Alan Becker like this coment
After seeing this video i think maths is a God of everything even the God should bow his head in front of the great maths. Maths is the besttttttt
you are genius
Here's an Idea: TSC's Warden Flute and Green's Singing.
Is interesant
Mooooor pls😭
My brain is broken🥴
Mathematics explained perfectly. Thanks
You are not sending videos last 1 month are you ok? Or you are working on a big project?
Can we collab pls
why no one is talking about the aleph number?
Pov: me queda poco para mis vacaciones pero m Las profes me persiguen hay el portal de vacaciones q son las mías atravieso el portal i llegó a mis vacaciones i las profes se quedan ai
BRO ORANGE IS THE SMARTEST CHARACTER IN THE WORLD
10:02
I would actually pay to see this (but longer) in the theatre.
Bro took ''weaponize Math'' to a whole new level!
Хпххпхп,  нам за 14 минут рассказали всю математику🤣   не то что школа
Kogda vuidit hovau seruq
The quality is absolutely mind blowing! Well done!
Wow is a so smart
Make season 4
와... 씨발.....
It's wonderful
This is so extraordinary. I have never seen such beautiful animation before
Mantap
א
It's incredible what you did, I'll just wait for your next animation to water, keep it up, sincerely (no name)
Make animation vs discord
Did Orange just make a Death Star out of math?
I now want a "Math vs." side series exploring these little math guys and their adventures together
Pov: Albert Einstein's son does not exist. Albert Einstein's son
bro what😭
What kind of music is playing here?
Wow i hav never been so hype and excited on how math works!
24 MILLION views in a month!   Nicely done
This makes math look fun

Can you make a movie about chemistry?
A game like that would be cool
very good
Animator vs Animation VI episode 2?
guessing he was battling Euler's formula
Bro roasted me in 14 minutes
Why is nobody mentioning the incredible sound design?
Video super but Alan Becker make a video with stickman and video animation vs cartoons

Is the Second Chosen dreaming?
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲😁😁
Yeah Guys... Is Nothing To Be crazy XD
1 + 2    3
imagine if this is how we going to teach things in future
The meaning of life
props to the mathimatians and to the animators
Hi
ni siquiera iba en la mitad del video cuando deje de entender la matemática que salía xd
cos(π) + isin(π) = e = pil
eiπ (e=pil)
Did I just learn math without someone saying anything
You should make a vid about the minecraft mobs called the allay and the vex
Now we need animation vs science. Specifically biology because biology is the best.
even though I'm a med student, but I'm still going to admit that after watching this video, I WANT TO BE MATHEMATICIAN...
I'm pretty sure they just explained a form of teleportation
Would love to see Animation vs. Maplestory someday :)
😮😮🎉😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮.commmmmm😮😮😮😮😮😮
Can you do Animation vs Red ball 4
Bro explained math better then my math teacher could 💀
Hi Allen Becker I have been watching your video for as long as I can remember and I was wondering if you could do me a favor and if you don’t I will not mind but for you next episode on animator vs animation could you put in a character that I made his name is Bob not the bob from your YouTube shorts videos but my own character that I made I think he would be a cool little guy to put in one of the cells at that place with the rocket symbol and I know you basically only do stick figures but if you do this this would be a cool idea please do reply to this comment.
Can you do make new video form bob is alway there is, bob's Revenge episoide 1 pls
Did the formula erase stickman in the end?
🐗
Broo i watch you un 2018-2029
Esto deberia estar en los Oscar premios
Nunca las matemáticas fueron tan divertidas
I have several stickman animations on this channel, I tried very hard to make them look nice. So I'm waiting for your opinion, I accept praise and criticism :D
This will give me a headache.
my brain hurts but this is rlly interesting-
Aiiii Vontade de desmaiar 😵😵
This video makes me want to learn math again
how did bro turn math questions into an intense battle
hey alan you should try animation vs terraria
ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW THIS IS THE BEST THING ANIMATION RELATED I HAVE EVER SENCE WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i now believe its canon that this whole thing is inside second's head and he's just trying to pass the time inside the cell he got locked in in ava 6, thank you DJ
If he still in contact with his math teacher
can you do jzboy met you
I really hope we see e^(i*π) again in another episode
You are truly amazing. I have watched this all day, and also other youtubers explaining every part. I am not that smart to figure it out all the small details. Well done mate. You should talk to the government to make these animations for all children in schools and in 300 years we will be on Aurora and Solaria.
Alan please New video stickmans vs fancy pants please❤️❤️❤️
С помощью этого видео я стал отличником по математике
Bro make more videos
This taught me more that school lol
Это эпичнее чем моя жизнь
homerun! 8:17
Unfortunately, YouTube only allow us one like!!!! It's a masterpiece!!
What was the giant variable in the end?
good animation alan
Can someone explain to me what e is and why is it such a brat
bro is a fast learner
Animation vs god of war
有幸在国内看到了盗版
Bro I literally hate maths Dude why do I have to slove alphabets💀 I've been failing in maths since 7th grade  I managed to pass In maths with one mark in 6th grade Now im in 10th standard and u still cant do maths
Duuuude, yall know the creator of Skibidi toliets? DaFuq?!Boom? Yeah, he might pass Alan Becker in subs one day… and it might be very soon…
so goooooooooooooooooooooood
I swear I heard this music in a dream before. Does anyone else hear this?
😂😂😂
I have been with alan since 35 subs and this one is my favorite
This video made me better at math thank you so much Alan!❤
amazing
Hi
I wish we could learn math this way
been a long time since alan made animation vs something other than minecraft! when will you make animation vs rhythm games come true?
amazing
보고 왔는데 1:40 부터 급발진을 하는데요..?
{10{10{10}10}10}10
OMG ALAN JUST SAID '' i can make anything boring into something for other to enjoy '' WITH JUST ANIMATION
hey alan, try to let your stickman play little Alchemy
11:08 like big planet
I understood nothing but at the same time I understood everything
10:35 like solar smash
This is cool
if u combine his newly found maths ability and his awesome arts ability, we'd probably get an equivalent to his "awakened" powers
Why you kill red sus
The masterpieece,exciting
god i have no idea what’s going on but this is amazing
Music
I came here just for music so whats the music name
AMAZING!!!!
Now,math is my favourite subject.
Never thought that math would be that cool.. thanks to you man, u make it so cool, so awesome
They almost killed eachother and then they were like "Nvm we cool now"
The coolest animation of all time😮😮😮
Never thought i'd be so into watchig math unfold before my eyes. Insane work as always guys!!
My favourite parts in this video is when Orange uses the circle, especially circle sounds. And that part when he climbs with the circle range. SO COOL. 😍😍
5:35 lets put the epicness of this animation aside but lets just look how TSC drew a perfect circle so perfectly it was just so satisfying
Am I the only one who saw this detail?  There was a giant aleph walking at the end of the video. Aleph basically represents oneness of god, so could it be the god of that universe?
You have done an excellent job, I congratulate you wholeheartedly. It was the most creative and gripping animation I've ever seen in my life, could you make a version of it for physics? :)
More moreee!
Guys i have diffirence between me and orange :  He understand all the math in 14 minutes and me 18 years
How the hell did he turn math into a sword fight?
I really like this animation Alan becker should get some shoutout
This made my day
When will you create wanted ep 2
Why does the e^i(pi) war cry at 10:02 make me giggle so hard? I love it.
Orange is smarter than me
Grande Alan un bacione dall'Italia
Didn't know math could be so badass.
This animation is showing me certain math things I haven’t even learned yet 💀
13:57 жду вторую часть
Called me stupid in 14 languages
He really maked M.A.T.H calculator sequel and he thought we would never noticed, we never expected and it dropped harder than chess 2
can you do animation vs science plz
this is beautiful
I love Alan Becker, he's like my father. He comes and entertains me only for one day and then leaves me for 1 month
Pls make a another vid alen b
good for those visual learner to understand fundamental
can someone tell me what happened at the end?
NOW ORANGE HAS A POWER LIKE GREEN
This has gotta be the most satisfying video of the year.
Math: 2+2 is? The second coming: 22
They should make animation vs terraria  With episodes based around boss fights
I triwd to understand as much as possible why certain reactions when their mathematical weapons clashed, I learned from the things I tried to comprehend.  I wanna learn math now just understand this whole vid.
this was a MONTH AGO?
NGL all of this wantse to learn math so I can understand ALL the references I couldn't completely comprehend in this Video.
bro tried to pull a radius on the mech lmao
All mathematicians would love this I SWEAR
Any ideas about the giant thing walking at the end ?!   Im wondering why I couldnt find anybody mentioning that !!!  I believe thats actually our Orange friend ! What do you think ?
Not once in my life has anyone been able to make math interesting for me. Now I want to learn what all this means!
Now this is how make educational videos.
Hello Alan Becker! When will you release Animator Vs Animation VI Ep 2?
-cos(pi)-isin(pi)=e^ipi
Matt Moore videos
my brain was like .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................what?
In Canada it’s the channel’s birthday today July 24th! 🎉
The final dimension
Idea: A collaborative with jacknjellify
Honestly i learned alot of math bc of this video Thanks!😊
you could probably show a 4 year-old this and they'd be 10 levels ahead of a college graduate
make more video
I think we got ourselves a new Einstein
God, I love the Riemann Zeta Function cameo at the end lol
Saw this on Insta and had to come like the actual video cause holy moly this is awesome
This stuff is so cool, looks like fun
Orange has his head around the multiplication sign 4:06
How many degrees did you need to make this
this is amazing, wow
if math was like that, it would be my favorite subject
after slowing to 0,25 I see new things. Masterpiece
10:01 oh you so cute little e ❤️
Wow, nunca creí que las matemáticas serian tan entretenidas
animation vs music next?
masterpiece
That is a very high quality animation
2:59 song name?
Alan u have 21m subs wont u show ur diamond play button???
If math class was like this i might pay attention better
amazingg!!!!
generally so cool
i hate math but this was great
11:04
11:15 I love how orange just throws a bunch if numbers down
8:39
8:03
Cmon man, it's been a month since ur last upload, make some more vids!
This animation makes math more fun
make ep 2
Video idea: Animation vs. Stick War Legacy (Mobile Game)   Edit: It Sounds Dumb But It's Kinda Fun You Should Play It Alen
animation vs portal 2
We watched this in maths class :D
Do more math now with all the sticks together
ust think that we only need these 4 letter to describe  this Universe PCMB 🗿🗿
i still love math XD
It would be crazy as a video game. Great job!
It's interesting that...Orange (The Second Coming )  Learned everything in math in about 20 minutes  And that's physically impossible for ANYONE to do all of that in one go in a chalk board or in a computer  But what's interesting to know is that he's a vector figure, meaning he's a figure made of numbers,  And basically to those who don't bother and reading long sentences put it in short  He's basically not himself so to speak
O
math in the future:
Integration and the circle was the real boss🗿🗿🗿🗿☠☠
If only math was this fun
Alan is just the best animator, like literally,  he may not be able to post daily but these animations do take a some time. Keep going bro, your the goat of animating❤
me in a math test be like:
This video is legendary in every detail about mathematics and about the fight ( marvelous ) ❤❤
One thing i like about it is that you dont really need to understand complex math to apreciate it, i didnt get like, 60% of what was shown here and even then this animation was fire
That's the feeling when a painted man understands mathematics much better than you :/
Math teachers: math is fun Yeah it would be cool if they showed us this first
I can finally doodle in y books
Wow he went from baby stuff to advanced stuff
4:16  đoạn này có vẻ như là một nỗi nhỏ. Chỗ đó đúng ra phải là - cos (n) - isin (n)
bro made math so fun!
this video made me enjoy math again
Worlds greatest movie
Alan Becker your amazing 🤩🤩
were did the א came from? like א in hebrew
I'm Team Orange, because I hate math 😅🤯
TSC: where the crap am i
Its big brain math time
Pls bring back the mincraft episodes 😢
Alan up the power in green please
We need animation vs Portal 2
Bro your my whole childhood
Proof math is bad and evil
We want a video about Bob
Animator vs. Animation VI - Ep 2 can you post it?
😮😮
we need animation vs animator
Nicw video❤
Sumamente natural(literal números y naturaleza d ls matemátikas)
2だよー！
Could you create a video about Animation vs Physics, please?
👋👋👋It's very beautiful, cool and, in general, WELL DONE!!!!!!! Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💗💗👍👍💪💪💥💥 It's a 💣!!!!!!!!!!!
For people who dont know Alan is executive producer of crash Bandicoot for ps1
I am math guy I really liked it and understood it 🎉
我不会觉得这里有中国人会来评论
Who want animation vs science 👇
Alan Baker इंपॉसिबल
Wow
Can u do animation versus FNF
animation vs anime please
Ok that was a surprise. I mean a very good surprise. I would definitely love to see more like this in the future. And before anyone asks I have been following these videos for a while and have liked every one of them. This one however feels like you got transported into the video and are watching it unfold from within. If you get my meaning. Very well done sir.
i stopped understanding when the 1 appeared from the sky
Next Part_😊❤

Bro teaches me better than my whole math teachers
Soo good please SERIES
Math + fight + animation =?
"the sun is a deadly lazer"
Just amazing.... no words❤
bro just proved even when not animating, he's smarter then jimmy neutron
The absolute beauty of this video lies in deciphering the subtle movements shown by the formulas used here.. For example the tan inverse gun to nullify the ei(pi). Simply beautiful piece of work ! Looking forward to the next one.
Bro teach better than a collegebmath teacher
WAAAAAA😂
If my teacher can have this patience and determination to teach us math
im only 5 minutes in, but THIS VIDEO GETS IT. e IS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE I HATE IT SO MUCH WHY DOES EVERYTHING REVOLVE AROUND IT
Bro I’m just a 7th grader
i think that it is so amazing video. it's like short movie. Respect
Thanks to this video I am now interested in Math 🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀🧀
Абажаю ево анимации
wow!
I'll assume that "-1" is "a negative one" for the behaviour 😂 superb animation & idea
1+1=2
e^iπ made copies and turned into that kinda thing and then that person made a gun with f(infinity) then e^i(pi] made a boss out of math
Amazing
Thankd to grade 9 math, i know some of these
Plus that guy is a quick hard mth learner
Oi can you make a video about animation vs jsab
I finally understand why we were taught math in school. It was so we could understand what was going on in this video
Hello, I would like to ask that recently I saw your account on the "B station" in the mainland software, is that account my own?
Alan is dead I think I hope not this is true
Wow this was phenomenal
Imagine a school classroom uses this that would be legandary😎
???????????????????????????????
What is this music it’s actually fire 🔥
YOU MISSED HYPERBOLIC TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS ON THE MEGAZORD
Bro just used the power of math
Pls make video  Demon slayer vs animation
Death Star but if death Vader liked math 10:59
que aparesca bob
Alan IM yours nomber 1 fends ferom indonesia teruskan membuat animet
I always hated that e
That was awesome!  I'm in Applied DiffEq right now and e is everywhere.
I bet the TSC is gonna show Alan some incredible math problems after TSC came out of prison
THIS IS SO COOL
No sé si fue real, pero recuerdo esta animación con otro final.
How teachers expect us to use math
It's like if xkcd was a Pixar short. It's amazing.
few ideas: 1. i would love to see this in future wanted series. since there is only one episode and the second coming,  s (or the orange circle guy) and i want to see more, since they stored some of the numbers in their "pocket" 2. make sequel of this please and i want to see variables too other than that i watched this video more than 5 times and i really love math
Beautiful
😢remember if Bob is there somewhere
are you going to make new vids?
we need a POV of one of the stick ppl. like red, orange yellow blue or green
Orange learned more math in 13 minutes than I learned in my entire school life
This is without a doubt one of the most creative Alan and his team has ever made
Uau, sinceramente maravilhoso, parabens
5:34 bro turned into dr strange
COOL ? VIDEO I LOVE YOUR VIDEO NO IM NO LOVE YOUR VIDEO BUT NE SONNE LOVE YOUR VIDEO?.....
Keren
how do you proof 1+1=2?
teacher: the test wont be that hard the test:
Now find X…
So satisfying😮😢
I couldn't follow the math, but it was creative and engaging
I love math, hadn't e not escaped he would have been evaporated.
Even being a terraria fan,i still Loves thats animations,maybe one time Alan will do a terraria version of it
Alan sps now I will know mathematics :)
bro played with the calculator a bit too much
The next AVM short should be Animation discovering the multiplayer mode of minecraft, and then playing bedwars And it would be funny if they play a round and win and then next round they get attacked and battle a hacker
❤
I sit in awe
Teacher: what are you doing for maths Alan?  Alan: oh! I’m just animating this math based battle! Teacher:… riiiiiight- *gasp* Also teacher: what the hell is this amazing thing?!
Make sure that Animator Vs Animation has the biggest twist out of every episode of Alan Becker (Like a return from some shadows from 2013 who are attracted to light or something bigger…)
Alan your epic youtuber because the second coming is so epic
I want to see more animations like lumin (10 yrs ago)
Mind blowing!
Tại sao không ra video mới 😭😭😭😭😭
¡HAGAN LA PELICULAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Make a part 2 of animation vs animator VI PLS
amazing content
yoo
So if theres animation vs math does that mean in the future well see blue red green and yellow take other subjects like Blue - History Red - Physical Education Green - Band/Orchestra Yellow - Science or Computing
this guy officially broke the laws of physics.
The Second Coming has discovers the matrix
Love that part when Orange meets the Euler's Identity
У меня нет слов одни цифры...
Somone can ecxplain me why he puts Hebrew letter at the end?
abi Lütfen yeni bölüm çıkar
Wow, thank you for this wonderful information.
bisa bikin coba ah 👍🏿
You can make a religion out of this
This is SO complex I can't understand anything late in the video Idea: Animation Vs Science
I want more math videos. Can you write only this type of channel?
We will continue the stickmen in Minecraft
Genial!
This is how to make math fun
10:01
Alan Einstein
Ok, I think this video was made to make you realize how fun math is. If I'm right, give me a heart
That was probably the most mesmerizing thing i have ever watched in my life, and i hate math.
This guy is a genius
I love every second of this. But there was a special extra bit of enjoyment when Aleph Null showed up (and how!!). :')
Cadê o próximo vídeo alan sou se fa
Orange: 100 IQ brain
I'm not understanding the end, what happen to stick man can any one tell me please 😢
I felt so satisfied at 7 minutes and 15 seconds
i wish i could learn math that fast
This video has summoned Math Gods in the comments man, holy
wery good vidio
Part 2 pls
Who needs school just watch this video
Stay in school kids. Then you can make a bunch of cool videos
Alan Becker covered almost every type of but in a 14:02 min YouTube video not even school can do that
please make an animation vs anime in which orane would be saitama
Wow!
I love math
Leave the poor E alone bro, he just wanted to be in peace
Muy bueno !!  1+1 =6  🎉🎉🎉🎉
Pov le prof de math: THIS IS A MASTERPEACE OF WORK
Now i learned everything by orange  by doing maths
the last time i watch his animation it was 6 month ago and now hes still the best
if math was this entertaining i would learn it forsure

ALAN, you live in Ohio, right? Dublin?
*Physics flashbacks*
just curious, how the hell did he get there
Math in studen eye be like
Humans are awesome
I can't believe Allan animated my fav subject
Maybe that is the true power of Oren stick man, maybe his power is manipulating space with some kind of coding based on matter/mathematics I hope it's true, and one day his powers will revive like in the fight against the virus
Lanjutkan videonya dong 😁
Bro Alan I saw someone who drew your characters as cats and the chosen one taking care of them 😑😑😑
this video is better than 90% of math lessons and i STILL learned nothing
Our boi made math look cool
i am so mesmerized by every action and sound he makes and its giving me goosebumps
Why i am hearing on background smth like ORA ORA ORA ORA
bro even managed to make math fun
Your smart at math like my girl
Get a plus and pull on the bottom. NOW CRUCIFY THE EQUATION!1!1!1!
&
There is one God, who created Heaven and Earth. He made us in His image and likeness. He made us to worship and we chose to rebel against God. As a result we are seperated from God but God didn’t leave us. Instead God sent His one and only Son, His Son is Jesus. He was born of a virgin and lived a life without sin, though He was tempted in every way as we are. He went on the cross and He willingly took our sins past, present and future. Jesus died in my place for my sins, paying my debt to God and purchasing my salvation. Jesus died but He rose on the third day victory over satan, sin, demons and hell. Jesus tells us to share this story of the Good News and there’s a God that lovingly pursues us. Jesus is coming to judge the living and the dead and those who trust in God will forever be with Him in His Kingdom and those who do not will suffer forever in hell.
This video is fun for math
Idk Who is still The Most Smartest On Yellow or is it Orange Now?
우와......!
no comment.
When your phone was taken away and you play with a calculator
1+1=2
4:56 When e^iπ got the fraction. It could have been e^((iπ)/4) so he can change into sqrt(i) and cos (π/4) + isin (π/4)  Edit: and the 4th root of -1
Bro your nerd
Me watching this for the 10. time.
Me when the x = [-b ± √(b2 - 4ac)]/2a and the 5x−3y=0,x,y∈Z and the  ( 1 + f y 2 ) f xx − 2 f x f y f xy + ( 1 + f x 2 ) f yy = 0
Math doom
1+1=2. I'm the best at Math!
‏‪א🇮🇱👍
damn that e is a natural fighter
I really love how you made the equations into weapons, now I know what to do during the boring math lesson
For real, I learn better maths by watching this video than in the literal math lesson
bro used the fucking equation for the universe or sum and used it as a rail gun and used hammer equations or sum fr fighting against math
ok🎉
orange: casually pulls a sword out the equation for the space time continuum  me: damn bro I can only do up to the 10 +10 + 20 + 40
part 2 ?
Not only is this smart and clever, you also ended up creating one of the most powerful weapons in all of fiction
Bro did A TRICKSHOT
Part 2 pliss
Shall be next part?
Wow men, this was incredible, the best video i ever seen, just amazing, thanks dude 👏🏻
God❤
Uh i hate math 👇
I get what this is about. Entertaining, now, get back to work, Math Nerds, the banks are not going to run themselves.
The coolest thing I have ever seen
Kênh rất hay. Cảm ơn bạn đã làm những video hay
Math vs animation fight😂😂😂
i dont get it
Like the video and THE MUSIC!
ฉันเกลียดคณิตมาก😅😅
Olha eu vou dar nesse canal mulher mais um vídeo de oração aí nada a ver mais um vídeo que ocorre a mano continua continuação na para animação versus animador que só vai botar outro vídeo diferente combinar empolas com esta olhar completa
Utterly delightful 😊
Now.all we need is the whole squad there reinventing einsteins theory of relativity.
to be continued?
Do skibidi toilet pls
Actually I'm weak in math but I enjoyed the video of your hard work.
can you MAKE A ANORTHER SEASON BY have face
Bored of math class thats why i am here😅
Alan becker please the "astronomy vs animation"
The math makes no sense 😅
easy to learn math
I understood everything until 3:46 seconds btw I’m 5th grade
And this all started by one thing (Get it)
Please dark lord not died Please I like the dark lord😢
hola
Purpose of all math is 'exit' from this dimension...
Bro made math even more complicated💀
Xd
Why is there no subtitle :( i want it back
The best math story ever told!
Is this apart of the current animator vs animations?
Who knew math could be cool
Your foley artist needs a raise after this one holy crap! I loved the sound design.  (foley is the adding of sound effects to a film, for y'all)
1+1=2
bro went assassination classroom on his math questions
Esperando anciosamente uma parte 2. -🇧🇷
Keren 😎👍
As a Math-Lover, very Satisfied
How do you make this it's so cool
1t2e3r
wow then this is  the math
Hey Alan Could you make an animation 6 ep2
This is the coolest animation yet
Muy bueno 1:21
u made math intresting again for me
How to teach your kid simple math, in 14 minutes!
Вы не задумывались но автор мог кого то заинтересовать в математике и этот уже человек в будущем может стать математическим гением или ешё лудше
I kinda wanna see like all of them fight a corrupt version of them
Bro it, s call Of duydi math or death
This animation feels like me when I played with my TI-84 calculator at school to see what I could come across and what I could make with that
Bro thought more math in 14min then 150 days💀
I see zeta Eta gamma and aleph
Khan Academy got some comp
It's been a year since I stopped studying math and switched to history, but I recognized almost all of what went on here. Except for e^(i(pi)). I have no idea what that is XD
number lore should just give up, this is wayyyyy better
The best animation I've ever seen
7:02 That was one of the most visually satisfying things I’ve seen. I can’t even tell you why.   Edit: Ain’t no way he just used that to make the Death Star
After he started with ÷ I couldn't keep up
This is just how schools started 😢
Alan could literally make "Animation vs drying paint" and somehow make it entertaining
I’m humbled 🙏
Animator vs Physics please
super fun
bro just solved X / 0
It's not like i understood at least something but... It was cool anyways
You lost me at the part when it said 1 = 1
amazing :D
bro I blown away on how he was able to do so much math that I never seen before
Cara...q INCRÍVEL!!! ❤❤❤
im incredibily amazed by this beautiful work
What happened to Orange? (Wrong answers only)
I hate math but this Is Dope
TSC wakes up in a world that looks...and is all black. And he sees that the number 1 is flying over him. And the 1 comes down and lands in front of TSC.  He clicks on the 1 and it turns into "1=1". Otherwise, what TSC did was to do a giant count to 100.  But he felt alone...until he had the brilliant idea to bring the number 100 to the number 98 and subtract 98 from "98" which gives 0. Then he subtracts 1 from "0" and gets -1. He does it up to -3 and adds a - to the "-3". Making it 3.  He started multiplying and dividing.  But before that, TSC had discovered an "ei" and in front of the "...i", he has the symbol "pi".  He discovered the i. I'LL CONTINUE IN THE NEXT COMMENT (OR EDIT).
I think yellow would love to be in this universe lol
Hey Alan Becker remember your first video it was a trampoline was that fun to make?
Now I know maths 👍2️⃣➕2️⃣
Plss alan Ep2 the Wanted i love it
This is spectacular. Trust me, I'm an  engineer.
I’m back😁
I always sucked at math. But I was able to understand the concepts here. Now I'm mad because all it took was for me to visualize the concepts as movable objects, which in turn, makes me see the beauty in math.
As a math teacher, I can confirm that we annihilate students using math
this animation and mind mathematics is just i dont even know what to say it blown my mind even math teachers mind can be blown
Alan Becker I’m your Biggest fan. And will buy your plushes if there not out of stock
And people say i will never use math in real life.... It can save your life
Orange is the smartest one now lol😂
Guys did someone miss victim? he legend?
Beautiful
Do science next
Guys but Bob...😞
What a wonderful animation😲
ААААААФФФФФИИИИГГГГЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕТТТТЬЬЬ
Anyone 2024 here?
Очень эпичная и милая и ещё добрая серия
My brain ain't braining
as someone who memorized enough math to pass the test and then forget it all immediately after, i don't get this video at all
Impressive!!
W
This is amazing
you should do a music one.
FNF
This kegend can litterally make anything look like a masterpiece that deserves to be at a museum bro. He litterally showed every math equations in 14 minutes. Huge respect🗿🗿
Puede haber un episodio en dónde Bob se venga
You can't just blow a hole into the surface of Mars
More interesting then a Marvel film gg bro
what up whit the big creature at the end,
Orange has learnt more maths in 5 minutes than me in 5 years
Omg! This is amazing!!! As someone that is studying in math right now. Omg! So much info, so many math! How do you do this!
Sound?
125162x142542x82636=?
1+23+50+7x1=?
Imagine, chilling in the beach until you get kicked into another dimension suddenly
I'm very lucky to find this channel... Thank you for your great work
Where he go? 13:52
This should be shown at the beginning of advanced math classes.
Is any of this accurate
This has made me love math for the time being, and I plan to exploit it
Is it all accurate 11:19
My brain is in the 4th dimension 9:03
Lost me at 7:12
Bruh
Love u form india😊
I’m only in 6th and my brain hurt 3:45
Orange dude is going through my worst nightmare
I love this animation you need to be genius to fight or escape
Larg the ma  os
Animation vs linux
everytime it more crazier
I didn't recognize 90% of these symbols 😵‍💫
.net
this would make a awesome math games your abilities are only limited to your math
Its amazing how people Focus on the math part but dont notice the Evolution of weapons that they use, First the Stick, Sword, Bow and Arrow, (idk how that Type od Sword is called), Gun, Heavy Machine gun and ending with nuclear warfare. Its crazy good! Well done!
Never thought I would think that math could be this cool
Who else hates math?
heh stickmen × cybermatcj
Idk much math but it's like i understand what e is saying to tsc and what tsc is saying to e......
Next: Animation VS Skibidi verse
This explained math better and quicker than my college professor lol
My Favorite part 10:30
评论区有中国人吗？
Episode2 pls
4:21  did someone noticed that when stick man hit by that - he changed the direction just like in maths
Bro is playing math on Hard mode
I’m like like how the hell this guy does it keep up the good work also my fav was the one with the new music disk pigstep
Alan can you please give green a power up
A apple made math if they don't discover gravity there's no math
👍👍👍👍👍
Can you try animation vs programming language
Me dodging a maths quiz:
Bro like mr incridible in kronis scene
I would like to see more of this.
Part 2
Let  Bob out of that prison
we need a animation vs science too
The best!
The sound design and the animation are just superb. This is fantastic!
Masterful
Amazing! The animation is great but what's more powerful is how the Math is taught
This is me when i was a kid i was want to be like my dad but my mission is faild😅😅😅😅😅
Actually amazing, never been this intrigued to learn more about math in my life 😂
数学竟然也可以如此美妙👍
Whos the giant at the end
This video is a testament to the power and beauty of human creativity. AI may be advancing in many fields, but it can never match the originality and depth of expression that humans have. I am amazed and inspired by this video.  -GPT4
когда новая серия аниматора против анимации
Pretty much the story of how Leonhard Euler found out about the e^(i * pi) equation.
I have a idea what about animation vs. Chess!!!!
Very sick man, we need another💪😅
Hmmm yes that math do be mathing.
Imagine if there was a game like this animation it would be fun af  Like a multiplayer 1v1, battle royale, or free for all creating space and damaging other players with bigger numbers and + & - operating differently like - as damage while + heals and × can combine with + or - to multiply  the efect of - & + or increase speed like in the video.
Napıyon kurt
I've never enjoyed maths like i did in this video.
Is this the final evolution? How can you _possibly_ top this?
Alan can you please make a plush of the characters
這就是我寫數學的情況了
what
Can you please make an animation with stickmans go against the camera man
e
Still a better love story than Twilight.
10:04
Imagine writing a script for this thing
The last e is in captivity. The Mathematics are at peace.
Bro my brain broke
Best animation ever
I am blown away. I have experience dopamine. I will keep it forever in my phone❤ love you and your team
Boring video.
Apakah boleh saya mau reupload video anda? Dan saya  suka dengan video menarik anda
this is more undetstandable than my teacher😂
Math will learn you for the life  Me when i will Be assalted :
“Teacher, I don’t get how this is useful in the real world…”  “It’s simple really, you can use it in a YouTube animation video”
That was truly amazing

This is so incredibly cool 🤯
The background music is absolutely perfect!
You probably get a lot of comments like this, but I’m so excited for the next AvA, it’s amazing, it’s so worth the wait
My brain can’t brain
Two thing why is math always so complicated and animation was Godley
2:49 woops
Man when is Wanted episode 2 coming out?
that's the most steriotypical impression of an asian guy, i've ever seen. dealing with math the anime-way! xD But jokes aside, really well done, had a blast watching this!
I can follow some of the mathmatic problem from the video but it was limit when it come to middle part of the vidoe math are  such a huge
My math teacher asked me to watch this it's amazing
The Aleph at the end! You gotta do a pt. 2 and just make an inaccessible cardinal got or Aleph omega
Next up:animator vs meth
1:45 bro really need to eat that π
TSC =KING math, TSC = the second coming
this is cool do more of this please
I just love how as the video progress, Stickman slowly learns math themself and uses their new knowledge to save them in countless and amazing ways
AHHH THERE ARE PEOPLE WATCHING YOUR ANIMATION LETS GOOO!!! I've seen oxford math professor and a nuclear engineer
I just went to preschool to college again and to think it all started with 1
this is perfection
The best video of all... wow
This is amazing, I am interested to learn this types of animation war.  I think that make movie about this topic and release in any ott

Also, how long did this take you to make?
What do you use to animate? Program, language, etc.
😮👏👏👏
My brain in the middle of a test:
Math is my nightmare        :edit I don't like math but I do like this video
Make my brain hurts
Animation vs skibidi toilet
I feel incredibly stupid after watching this video!
é por isso que prefiro não estudar matemática... nunca se sabe quando ela vai se revoltar
Bro is teaching us math
I want the second 2 part please (◍•ᴗ•◍)
Me quedé flasheando
That's so interesting❤
This video sent me back to college when I was studying maths. Good times
Вы тоже искренне болели за челика?
That was amazing
Wooh! One of my favorite animations of all time already ❤
did this man seriously trick us into learning math
I hats that I don't know enough about math to properly appreciate this!
Please continue
The music in this video reminds me of the Bourne movies. 😂
5:34 draws a perfect circle like its nothing
Pov me trying to get out of math class💀💀
Beautifull, like a maths. I love maths. THanks for that master piece.

Hope he does a re-run of the stick figure plushies.
The way he created pi is insane
one think i learnd forom this video is i dont know math
The over flow of knowledge in one video and i barely understood much of it. Made it look simple but my lack of understanding on a lot of this makes it hurt my smooth brain.  Yet visually stunning
😵

Can you mane a video about "just shapes and beats"? Pls
in time 8:37 it seems the walking bad hahahaha😆😆😆
Pensa cmg,em 9:41 a arminha dele ta com o infinito em parênteses né,e em 10:34 tá com o ponto denovo oque a torna mais fraca,se ele pusesse o infinito denovo oque ia acontecer né ksks
The way TSC carries the 2 at the beginnig is 2 cute

Top quality content
Imagine how many more people would love math if this was used to educate 😳
To those wondering, they are fighting cause it is an irrational number
Pog
I love these animations about stickmans because they are all different, they express their emotions not with their face but with their movements, because they show friendship and character that cannot be conveyed by voice or face, they convey it with movements the best scenes, the best stickmans and in general the best that can be drawn and animated I'm not from England I'm from Russia but in any case, I will like to watch about the animations of these stickman). P.s Fuuuuhh! I've been writing for a long time, but this is the only way I can convey how much I love watching stickman
0 - maths😮
Bro learning math like its nothing
how about try some roblox
Honestly, alan can make anything fun
For the first time I wish I understood math better😂
do animation vs technology
Can you continue the wanted series?
This is my first time saying math is actually cool..man this a  MASTERPIECE
The best video I have ever seen !!!
aaaaa its genious!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who's here from Tom Rocks?
Wheris wanted animator4 ep 2

id like to think this is in tsc s mind while he was paused before he woke up
10:02 Waaaaaaa!
HUH the end....is that a real math symbol? If it is uh uh . Uh. I failed school!
Teachers should be showing this in schools 999999% of people would agree
Its math lesson better then lesson in school
masterpiece
It was amazing 😯😨😨😨😨😨🤯
Amazing and love from india.
I'm no into math but I like your animations
This is most likely a test of intelligence or a prison given to SC by his the people holding him at the end of animation vs. animator VI, they most likely didn't expect him to escape... or... it isn't part of that at all
So exciting
Hey Alan can you make more videos like animator vs animation V
We finally like math for once
i should have taken math i don’t understand 80 percent of it
Masterpiece.
I got an A+ after this..

everyone must admit he is smarter than isaac and einstein🗿🗿
Папичу бы задонить на просмотр, эх.
Me: *falls asleep in the middle of math class* The math teacher:
Can someone tell me what the hell that giant thing at the end was, I’m confused
Bro math is ruined by teachers so much. This video (in a weird way) does actually teach the mechanics of math. The only part that is iffy is the battle.
When the teacher says “math is important for your future”, this is what they’re picturing.
should i send this to my math teacher
This was three weeks ago? I can already see this being put on the legendary must-come-back-to-every-so-often list of youtube videos...
13:20  Are we just gonna ignore the fact that orange just got banished to the shadow realm or is there some math thing happening there?
this is what math should have been
I know actually everything, but what about this "f" that looks like intrgral( i forgot what was that) Who knows, pls tell me
б is for greek
eit's is -1 and i × i × i = eit
The 3rd one looks like ф for russian

I've watched your video. when I was young and haven't seen for a very long time until I came across this video.  i like it very much
when will you make part 2 of stick figure wanted?
Animation vs Neural Networks or Animation vs AI will be so cool to watch
Whoever made this needs an Oscar with the most highest number possible
This is exactly what I see in my math exams 😂
Bro getin smart
Master piece... I really love it.. but im still cant math sry sir
It took bro 14 minutes to do the math I did in 14 years
sempre assisto seu canal eu sou do Brasil 👍
😢🟠
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Understood until 7:42
great works done We need more of these animations to revive the interests of the younger generation.
I watched the whole thing and now i feel like isac newton

Super para explicar y apoyar un concepto.
My teacher will be mindblown
Me who's so bad at math, not understanding any of the equation
Bro literally explained math
bro puts kindergarden to college what a legend
I'm not kidding when I say this made me have an interest in advanced mathematics. so thank you alan becker and the team for making this
Bob should be in the next video
Bro just broke the record of maths
STICK MAN vs ANIMATION
WE NEED ANIMATION VS MATH 2
I don’t even think this how math works 😂😂 but nice animation

I found Albert Einsteins successor😅
Now i need to see what you'd do for a V physics video
wow simnply amazing, i am trying to imagine the story boarding for this one , this is what one should preserve along with seeds and species for the preparation of end of the world.
the lore behind this is crazy
The video is very interesting, even though I didn't understand it at all.
Alan has animation vs skibidi toilet
satifying to watch
Alan can you relpy my text i got something for u so:for the animation vs animator part 2 a character his name is gonna be white and he has a power and his power is gonna be fire at his enemy is grey and at the end he takes his sword and use his brother aka the chosen one he use the lighting power and kills grey but he dies as well so pls relpy plsssss alen i watch all your vids and i like them all and im subricribe so plssss alen plsssses❤
Alan, this is brilliant, thank you very much.
Now, this is the type of math I can get used to
Alan you’re a math teacher now
My brain is too tiny to understand this
Typoman vibes, but maths and more intricate ❤
Когда анимация может многому научить чем учителя
Give them voices
Really really amazing animiation i always feel like I'm watching a movie or something bc i like ur animiation alot they are so cool

Bro learned math in 14 minutes
My math teacher is going to love this
Man made math fun
I wish the show never end it was AWESOME!
My cat looked at my phone while I was watching this and she looked like she just found the meaning of life
Alan just made math actually entertaining. What a legend.  (If anyone understands any of those, you know how much school taught you.)
absolutely phenomenal
Ojala sacaran algun videojuego de esto 🤓
I feel like this is gonna get used in math classes with a mix of math problems and equations with a mix of entertainment idk why
Bro explained math in 14 minutes
The fact that the math is on point is just...beautiful
Why is there fortnite lobby music playing over the whole video lol
Imagine sending this video off into deep space, and some aliens find it.  They'd pretty quickly find out that it's about Math, since quantification is the purest form of logic in the universe.  But imagine if the aliens saw this, said "so this art was presumably made by a species to rage at mathematics." "Mood." Says another alien.
Well at least tsc is smarter then yellow now
수힉으론 못만드는건 없다.

im yo fan can you please make tiktok vs animations please
i'm not the biggest fan of mathematics, but this gives me motivation to learn it and see how amazing they can truly be.
I understood thr first little bit of math then it got to the complicated bit and got lost haha
My brain just broke from trying to understand this 🤯
Bro has so many idea I love when he uses the most random things into animations I feel like there is a lore and it's so thrilling I really like there is powerful characters,unique characters and side characters like it's like a tv series like skibidi toilets it's not funny but it's entertaining like this master piece
0:14 21 Jul 2023
This started by. One plus one.
Pov: You are the calculator of Hidetaka Miyazaki
Im learning geometry
re cool
I just gotta say, this has to be my favourite of all of Alan’s works, which really is saying something. I loved his Minecraft series and AvA, especially the 5th one with the dark lord was incredible. But this one resonated with me for some reason. Maybe it’s the real life values of the math questions and that I’m not sure. It also came out right after I finished my final school exams so I was in the academic mindspace to appreciate this masterpiece. I remember scrubbing through the video slowly on my first watch lying in my bed at 3AM to try and break down each math problem TSC encounters. But kudos to you Alan for this masterpiece. I seriously see you winning an award some day. Keep up the brilliant work.
we need a sequel
10:33* activates orbital strike*
I feel like I am watching a movie Great job!
cheers very bies it was super cool
Nobody: *me trying to figure out how tf math works*
He learned the whole maths foundation than me lerning to count
Now math is not only for math people. Literally if we just take this amazing story and turn it into a game where in each stage I have to know what to do in order to beat the enemy and get to the next level I would fail let's say 20 times just like call of duty but I would still continue because it's call of duty not math. If we could turn this into a game all the gamers would love it and as a result good at math
The sound design in this video is SO GOOD.
epic
Bob is still there.
Algebra explained in 14 minutes
Fantastic video shown to me by my kid,  now he is excited by complex numbers and integrals. What a great way to make Maths lovable and Interesting 👍👏 Big Thank you
Mathematical problems just do the trick. I know some math problems, very cool. Like 5×9=45, and 2×2=4, simple one yet. The biggest ones of mathematics are very difficult and frustrating. If you're like ALBERT EINSTEIN or NUTTIN, prepare for your biggest challenge ever🧠
bro really explained 8+ years of math education in a 14 minute video 💀
are you gonna make a video of the stickmans taking the grimace shake or fighting with the skibidi toilets?
I dont get it but i still learn something new
Blox fruits?

❤😂😅nice
Plz make another Avm video I miss them
I miss math so much
I learned more about mathematics from this video than in my whole life
This is Very Creative, at the same time Awesome
Me earlier:  why is that math just exist, i don’t need it. Me after watching this video: INFINITIVE POWER OF MATH BLASTER!!!!!!!
This is incredible I am speechless
Plot twist: he was just playing with the calculator
This visual representation of how math works is absolutely amazing! I love it so much! I’m only at a pre calf level so I start to not understand what’s going on at just the halfway point haha! But I do this it would be great if this was literally a program in VR! Being able to “physically” interact with numbers in this way could genuinely help others understand math in ways others can’t! Thanks for this Alan!!
This is some profound work, school would be easy if we had such content back in the 90s.
Pls.. my brain is overheating pls stop😢
I just gained infinite brain cells after this
Help me 😂😂😂
I guess math really is evil
Its just satisfying to watch this,so briliant. Keep up the good work
What math teachers expect from us:
He really be using math to fight the math
You should make voice acting
I feel bad for your animators man... They sold they souls for this animating gift and now they're soulless god tier animators ☠️. Jokes aside, good animations and everything.

That's what I call "mathematically perfect") Actually, I was trying to search incorrect moments, but all good))) Enjoyed it much, thank you)
Man if only mathematics was like this, I’d understand it more
Nlg the Video is Amazing and Epic But the real Questiin is, How did TSC end up in this universe, will this universe be later connected to the "Animator vs Animation" Series or might connect to some future series Alan is gonna Create.
This was amazing! Be using Kamui to transport dimensions lol
It's BIG BRAIN TIME
-cos(n)-isin(n) not -cos(n)+isin(n)  is litle wrong lol 4:17

OHH MY GOD!! This video has blown my mind... Thank+you=❤
This is better than 3Blue1Brown's animations
WHERE IS EPISODE 2?!
A math genius and a great animator More what talent Do you have it for us to show?

This is actually genius my jaw was on the floor the entire time and I found myself repeating "wowww" "that's crazy" "woahh thats genius" like this is actually amazing. Even tho I don't know everything in here but this just blew my mind and introduced me to new concepts and things I never knew, it even helped me visualize things I already knew
TSC can use EVERYTHING as a WEAPON
The start: 😮😮😮😮😮😮 The ending *ITS SO SAD 😭*

Also hoping for part 2, there is so ath left to explore! We haven't seen orange guy wield Summations, limits, derivatives, or variables (algebra) yet! His mathematical journey has only yet begun...
NGL, that ending had me on the verge of tears.
Can you make letters vs animation please

Fantastic!
Is that the furry flag symbol at the end?
Pls bring part 2 . It's better than Avengers end game 😂. I felt goosebumps ❤
2:48 NOOoooooooooooo...oh, it wasn't so bad
Oh my god.
It's shocking how accurate the animation is when it comes to explaining complex math concepts and then showing how they work to our real world allowing people who lack the understanding to visualize it gg my dood
Wow . God job 100000😍😍😍😍😍😍👍👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Hey just wondering, if your done with an animation, can u do animator vs portal
I demand animation vs 2B2T minecraft server!
Make animation vs math 2

When are we going to get a throwback to Orange’s powers
How can some guy come along and make the most tearful animation with stickman and math
also love your animations your the best never give up i wana be like you!
im also an animator and i hate math that made me click the video lol
I met you when I was 8 years old and I saw an animation and remembered you again, now I'm happy because my childhood memories came to my mind🥲
Me in my math class 💀
My brain hurts
This is magical 👏
Cause you please make a series about Bob coming back
Thats made brilliant
Someone needs to make this into a game or VR game
Isn’t this the journey of every undergraduate student in maths?
the video is very cool and when will you make the animation against teraria? about minecraft already exists, but about teraria there was no more, teraria is a kind of minecraft. and yes, I wrote this from Ukrainian to English because I'm bad at English
I didn’t understand anything😂 I think he broke reality
Animation vs Geometry next? 😛
My brain hurts after watching this
Hey Alan I want you to make videos with purple and king orange and other stick figures and live in your computer with doing what the others do in your computer. Please do this Alan Becker
Bro this taught me more math than school has ever taught me

Alan Becker.  There’s a game that post ads about ur clips and ripping u off. They are stealing ur clips and turning into ads and luring kids to play it
i dont think im smart enough to understand this lol
what's going on in my head on a math test
Next physics 📀💡
quá ghê ghớm , nhưng lúc nhân đôi ei& thì là - không phải + nhá :)
Damn, the Euler identity really woke up today and chose violence
What is that shadow behind at 13.42 ?
You know you made a good math video when it’s 14 minutes long, people choose to watch it, And watch the whole thing without getting bored.
Can u make new videos about other science??? It’s awesome ❤❤❤
Me experimenting with my calculator:
Climax is mind blowing 😊
Ok but seriously when are we getting voices for the stickmen!
math is beautiful 😭
이분.. 애니메이션 vs 마크도 그렇고그림뿐만 아니라 연출력, 스토리 빌드업 등등 진심 영화 한편 뚝딱임
Awesome!
This is so cute

Mind blowing, amazing how it captures the essence of mathematical thinking. Beautifull thought experiment illustration. Hats off.
What a video. Just awesome.
Some things should be studied by film students, this should be studied by fucking theologians.
Another masterpiece, wow
You should do an animation vs Dream.
Why do you always need to make a masterpiece out off everything
Alan Becker is literally a legend. And he taught me "patience" cuz I need to wait like.. months or whatever for him to upload a new video.
Just think how sick it would be if maths was taught this way in schools🔥🔥🔥
Can’t wait for Animator vs animation part 2
Briefly about the dreams of Albert Einstein🗿:
You are the genius animation 😮😮😮😮😮
수학샘 반응이 궁금하다 ㅋㅋ
Well done for teaching kids in lower school who like animation but not math university math🎉
alan becker is teaching math better than teachers
now u need to make chemisty vs animation mode xd
@alanbecker u should to animation vs undertale, would be so fricking cool!!!!
is bro smart or something?

Wow!  What an amazing animation 👏👏👏
8:29 sinπ value is wrong!
I'm still trying to understand the math.
Video so amazing and good❤😊
bro took "math is not that hard to an whole new level
The attention to detail and sound design are so darn satisfying. Love your work!
I need this guy as my math teacher
This is far more logical than we think It shows evolution of world from 1 and -1 helped to attain 0

Please new season i like this maybe animation vs mouse maybe...
My qi after this vídeo 999999999
Đây là siêu phẩm thứ mà tôi ít thấy trên Youtube. Đây là video mà tôi thích nhất từ trước đến nay. Cảm ơn bạn!
I won't pretend to understand a lot of the math notation but this is absolutely incredible. Everyone who worked on it should be super proud.
what if animation vs english vocabularies?
Когда новое видео ?
You are ZE king of anamation
That was beautiful to watch i wish i understood it
Nice video from Greece ςερτυθιοπασδφγηηκπζχψωβνμ
Pov: Tsc when he is in prison
Orange crazy op now
This was extremely awesome to watch, well done to all the animators that did this!
지린다...
is good for my son
When will next video come
So he made math everybody jump him!
Actually i understand nothing while watching this 💀
Watching this for the second time I noticed this was a fight between rational space and imaginary numbers. Pretty damn creative!
Did you know that the start of a first person game, you are the cameraman. Did you know the start of your life, you are the cameraman?
the journy from lkg level maths to advanced pro max mathematics proff level was AWWWESSSOOMEEEEEEEE
The sound bro, its like asmr
Now we need a multiversal math movie directed by Christopher Nolan.
Alan gracias a tu mentor matemático y tu gran talento has hecho cosas inimaginables. Gracias por existir. Me eres de nucha inspiración y te lo digo con todo el corazón
Make a video on Physics like this
Eres Dios. Ni bien he entrado y ya le puse mi like y comentario. Habria visto tu video antes pero fue de ojeada cuando lo vi y no pensé que era tuyo.
Can you do on science please
i ligit just learned more here than at school
Masterpiece
This is the equivalent of when you're bored with the calculator
Let’s goooooooo
Its been 12 years my friend and am back.
남에  유트브 했잖아요
BRO THIS A MOVIE
Unbelievable 😮😮 animetion
Well I didn't understand any of that.
For anyone still confused about why Euler's Identity is so powerful, I was too until someone put it like this:  Euler's Identity, when expressed as e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0 is such a powerful equation because it represents the five most important numbers in all of mathematics.
👍
He’s getting smarter
He used the math as weapons so cool
What Richard sees when playing calculator
me drawing stick figures is my dream when i was young i like watching ur Animation vs Animatior Series  It was Very Good And Fun To Watch You Make Me Be Inpirsed to be a stick animatior
next do animation vs meth and have breaking bad references everywhere
alan make animator v part 2 pls
As a kid i always thought i could make videos like this
Hola soy nuevo en el canal tu vídeo son asombroso 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👍
Lol so cocky
This is the masterpiece !! The creativity in this is so enormous  that can't describe & i really feel this is the Most Creative Video on Internet... Please give Him Award of Something ... 😢😢😢
So youve done it man, youve made it to the top. what are you gonna do with that? your still a clean slate in the public eye. How will your name be made. Ive watched you since the start. I imagine you as someone who cares but doesnt know what to say about.

This is part of the reason why I love math so much, it’s just so beautifully complex.
the letter alef of the hebrew alphabet at the end is of immeasurable value
A letra alef no final é maravilhosa

I've got a question will the dark lord be coming back in the next episode of animator vs animation?
I didn't understand any of this 💀
You should do animation vs Roblox
I like the Animation VS. Math it's really good so far. Can you make a new like this?
masterpiece
Make Animation vs. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe!
And don’t cuddles xi ding djx
I love this!
Wow
really cool
Whats the music called?
If math was this fun.....
Make the crew meet maths?
Is he the new Einstein
Truly and amazing cinematic masterpiece
You surpassed every other work of yours you're a genius
(math is always the villain)
How to motivate students for math classes:
Please do a video where the stick figures meet animated james from theodd1sout
If I ever have them, I’m using this video to teach my children.
Bu tür videoları Enes Baturdan izlediğim zamanlar dünyanın prime dönemleriydi
My guy just make math fun
Brilliant! Your best work so far - except for the Minecraft stuff. Bravo!
i'm gonna love Animation vs. Skibidi toilet
Thia is trippy as balls when watched qhen stoned
alan went to another of collage for this
I love math
Can you do a video called "Animation vs Roblox Doors"?
This was fckin amazing!  Can’t imagine how good it must be for ppl who are into math.
I just noticed the animation for TSC grabbing another 1- just after the Identity Property is established- and then a 2 a little after, is the Identity Property being used again. You can see as the number pulls away that there's an equals sign between the dupe and the original.
just O M G!!! Best video in years I've seen for maths and science.
Man this video is the Best thing I’ve seen all month Alan and his team make a banger once again
wow 😮
This was better than a myriad of today's movies! Truly superb! Greatly done, mate
Bence bu animasyonlara bir oscar ödülü  verilmeli
What a fascinating way to interpret the divide by 0 problem! I thought of something similar to this myself.
This is the only thing math Related that I enjoy, and it's so cool
This video made me feel the beauty of mathematics. This makes me have to imagine what kind of scenario the so-called mathematical law confrontation is like
Sensacional 👏👏👏👏👏👏 to fascinado com esses vídeos,
It would be cool to see something similar with chemistry
Awesome ❤ more please:) 🎉
0 / 0 just creates a black hole
Alen had to do math wich is sad
Alan did not only entertain us but helped us with our maths homework 😂😂😂
If math was taught with them i would be invested
amazing this video talks about math super cool
This is a masterpiece,and a nerd one, great job you guys did with a simple subject
I NEED THE SOUND EFFECTS FROM THIS VIDEO!!1!
I watch a lot of things and i usually don't press like button even if I like them. But this masterpiece forced me to like, share and comment it. I was also a maths nerd, so I understood the entire meaning of all the equations.. everything was upto point. I never thought by using maths, someone can actually make this type of art and story. Animation and sound effects are absolute banger. Overall This is more than what I could imagine.
Wow ! This is great Can you make 2 part please! This so awesome!
Conclusion: TSC dislikes Algebra
Never had been math that cool

This is isnane wth Maths! When back to Animator vs. Animation VI?
How the hell does this feel harder then middle school MATH?
This makes my head spin and explode 😅
this is so coooooooollllll ik im lost after the logarithm but it's still sooooooo cooooollllll and so much thought and effort put into it
Oh my god, I am done to 4 mins, anybody else?
Learnt the entirety of math in 14 mins and 2 secs  Anyways this is genuinely really cinematic and the background music and the sound effects?? Cinematic 🙏🙏

Nice you nice!
Klo kita dah mgeraguin 1 + 1 munkin itu tandanya kita dah dewasa yah walaupun kata kata gw gk jelas munkin ada benarnya nya lah
The way I was invested in this 14:02 minutes video I wasn’t in the new Transformers movie and am not even sorry about 🫣
im to stupid
alen explaining ALL of math in one video
math has never ever been so epic
Not OK because there are too many formulas.
If AlanBecker would be my math teacher i will be smartest guy in my country
I love this so much
What the music?
11 лет математики за 14 минут
Bro went from kindergarten to calculus 17 in like ten minutes
한국인이여 모여라
Too Hard for me.  😅
Bro uses math to kill while we are learning it to be killed
the fact Alan grew from a trampoline time lapse to animating thing like these, its awesome. Alan, we appreciate your hard work :)
I mean its so so perfect and the sound design is mind blowing, glad I came across this video and channel💗
Nossa fique abismado não sei o que dizer uma luta + do que lendária 😮😮❤❤
More videos please make animators vs animations vi please I’m waiting for to long now
Its very interesting.May I move this video to Bilibili? I don’t use it commercially.
The math is not difficulty The math:
Final answer was -1

We need a part 2
I’d love to see another with other forms of math, this is so exciting!
I love you
That was probably the easiest way to learn math tbh

animation vs geometry dsh pls
As a developer for a math learning app, I'm blown away by how math has been visualized here. I've been on a similar path with my project, Animath, which uses animations to explain algebra step by step. It's incredible to see the potential when you bring animation and learning together. If you're curious, I have more about it on my channel. Thanks for sharing this inspiring work, it's truly motivating for creators like me!
animation vs geometry dsh pls

10:27 is prolly my favorite part so far

This deserves a trillion views 👍👍👍👍
Don't forget the power of circle
Bro literally explained math and physics Combined
When Mathematician get job of animator.❤❤❤❤❤
연출이 좋네요
Alen bro What if you make a game with the whole team please I'll play like a dog but the game is free
This animation is awesome, must've taken ages to make. I thought the cracks into the imaginary world would be a Mandelbrot or Julia fractal, that seems like a missed opportunity.
This is why alan is my favourite youtuber
Very well done from start to finish!
Man.. does time fly by quick. I remembered this one video where the og stickmen fight YouTube, and it’s quite old now. Man, i feel so old.
Why don't you do it? Water Ep 2 Go
This shows maths has its own universe 😮😊😂
Waiting for Animator vs animation ep2
Amazing work, thank you for this
First time a math video brought me to tears :) 22M videos in 3 weeks, this will trump the internet faster than any Mr. Beast video.
Okullarda bol bol izletilir matematik hocalarıda açıklama ile destekler, bravo harbiden yorumlarda dedikleri gibi resmen bir sanat eseri ürettin 👍
I dont even know half of what is happening
Yo imagine they get the debug stick next on minecraft 😅
2:52 POV when you broke the math:
Aaaa qat 2 ❤
ok ok 🧠 😮
Oh wow that was some wicked cool stuff
I finally understand math now,this animation help me a lot XD.thx alan
Math is so beautiful
ไม่รุ้เรื่องลย
This could be implemented as a VR game. This is a masterpiece.
Please new video
amazing
To put it short with out writing a whole essay on this, your creation knows no bounds
HOW DID YOU MAKE MATH SO COOL???
❤❤❤❤
Bro is just showing off at this point😂😂😂

there should be a game about this u know this is so cool, like imagine using all these equations in a same style as thiss!!
I understood this better than I have ever understood math class
why is there a big א in there?
Bro Iq 9999999999
I've never been so invested in math in my entire life...
This is amazing 💖💖💖💖
Bro started from elementary too college mathematics amazing!
I'm gonna say right now this video made me learn more math than the teaching schedule of school
This is Amazing , a Real Game changer, one of the best creative ideas that I have ever seen , I think this will change in how we precive mathematics and how Math should be teached in schools and colleges…      There will be No turning Back, we wont accept!!!
I want to go back to math class now, i feel that i missed to many interesting classes
Does any mathematic know what is going on?
If math was like this I would do it
Bro turned into a orbital cannon 💀 10:18
Math lovers are gonna pee themselves from emotion, I'm already on it
I can you make a minecraft stickman again but make another portal in the cherry biom please 😊
What animating software is this?
This proves that there is infinite possibilities in math
It's a math mmm.. I don't remember he knows
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮WTF me sorprendió el vato, oye Alan puedes hacer uno igualito pero haora con física
He did it guys. He made math fun.
POV : สมองผมเวลาทำข้อสอบคณิต
With this being a work of art. It would not surprise me if you make Animation vs Science
If I even tried to understand the math in this, my brain would liquidate and run out my ears
e
This is crazy
Math is cool
Genial.😮 Este video será de referencia por muchos maestros y nunca dejará reproducirse en YouTube.
is much sad is cooll is all
Wow this is so cool! Also i don't think much peoples knows about Zeta, Phi and Delta (and Aleph as well)

math hurt my brain
i watched looney tunes and disney as a kid. studied math at college, and film at University.  this is Fantasia level. Amazing
Absolutely phenomenal!!
Who said math can’t be cool?
bro reduced the precollege and some of the college math in less then 15 MINS!
Thank Alan when I watch this I realized that I have math homework ☠️
This is amazing just wow
bro learned all math in under 14 minutes when it took me 2 years to understand multi and division
He should do one with the alphabet next
He divided by 0, and got infinity.
a verdadeira matemática são os amigos que fizemos no caminho 😔✊
やあ
Bro FINALY made math look fun to use  Like turn this into a vor game, teachers are gonna start bringing vor headsets that has a game about math that’s actually fun
Better then most of my math classes
how did a stickman learn everything in math in 14 minutes while everyone else learns math in 10+ years
¿Animation vs bendy ink machine or animation vs sonic?
Why does this video make me feel so damn happy? It's like a 6th sense gets triggered and wants to scream from joy.
hey Alan Becker how about animation vs. terraria
Man shout out to you, this was outstanding, the most entertaining video ever "for nerds lol"😁
The music change at 1:40 is awesome.
This is one of the most amazing things I have ever seen!
never knew how math could be so cool
This is genius!
when are you going post a new banger alan becker?
dude learned math faster then flash moving and inch
Bro built the Death Star with math💀
Is he dead😢
pro alan becker
This is a masterpiece. There are no words to describe my amazement.
I am amazed! This is incredible! Seeing orange guy(idk his name) using a sword made out of a plus and a one is so creative and brings me so much joy. I love how his bow and arrow is the statement 2x2, and where the arrows come from is an = sign, and the arrows themselves are 4s. 2x2=4. Math used in animated weapons. That's gotta be my favorite little bit.
Orange is the smartest man alive👓🟠
Excelente, un muy buen trabajo.
hey bro, ma brane is broken🤯
I thouroughly enjoyed this as a huge math nerd, but I also must say, the animation and sound design here was so strong, I was constantly sitting at my computer going "this is so fucking cool"
Make portal 1 animations
ancient greek philosophers would've loved it, cheers
Finally, engineering college is coming in handy
Is just amazing, what a imagination 🎉😮 congratulations !!!
Imagine TSC having these math based powers in the next video and using them to escape his prison.
My brain after watching this video:🤯
Which episode
Amazing. Season 2 pls
Wow you're done the journey come get some rest
13:45 The giant N XD
Great animation! I can't wait to tell my therapist that i was crying over mathematics.
Incredible
Eelbert Einstein theroey
Why this video is so entertaining 😅
😵😵

,e👾
Post plz
😮😮➗➗➗➗
Who thinks he is in a simulation by the mercenaries to test intelligence
Oh I LOVE THIS VIDEO❤
SigmaΣ vs He ☠️☠️☠️
How to imagine like the one who made this? Someone help !!
Wow found a dude who made an actually good Alan Becker fan made animation, CatGod904
Just . . . cant describe it .👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
French kiss editing
Sequel now
Next animation vs. Chess
This is just amazing
e^i.π
Why haven't your new animations been around for a long time?
Im going into high school and if this is the math im doing im scared
Omg, this is so *ʜᴀʀᴅ*
Can you make one of "Animation VS Angry birds" please??👍
棒人間と数学だけでこんなカッコイイアニメができるなんて… やっぱAlanさん天才やわ
Cool ❤ Try to make a movie that monsters from SRParasites have invaded your PC! It would be cool!
What's an aleph doing at the end?
great way to teach math
Now imagine Animation vs Chemistry, featuring Blue Or perhaps Animation vs Zoology, featuring Red Animation vs Engineering, featuring Yellow Animation vs Musicology with Green :v
@FajrulFx
it would be really cool of the golden ratio was in here
Idk why but this kinda satisfying to me the sound are just soo good
i learned more in this video than in my school. this is perfect
ПОВ: нет ничего эпичнее аниме.  Так же Аланбеккер:
I've never been much of a mathematician, but if I can also make a Death Star from the power of math, then I may just have to go back to school.
Does anybody understand the math in this video or am I just stupid?
ONLY 830K LIKES?! AND ONLY 20M VIEWS?! I'VE SEEN STUPID SHORTS WITH MORE! WTH IS THIS UNFAIRLY CRAP!
1+1=1😐
I have a idea for a new video animation vs horror games
كل هذا سببه رقم واحد 😂
Tbh i dont know THAT much about math but would love to see the Tiny e return someday😂
This is more fun than a simple math equation. This is a masterpiece of Alan and his team, this is impressive.
i feel like this would be a fun game, e is your enemy and you have to use math to create all powerfulll weapons to kill e
Wow! Beautifully done 😮😄🌸🌱
The power of math makes you want to go back to school
Can you make Wanted ep2
DiD away to spone e😃
9:50
Man, what are you? Incredible
Can you shoot a video on the application you use and teach how to use it
finally 1+1 is What?🤣🤣🤣
bro knows math better than 99% of the world
bring back the dark lord please🙏
They should use this to teach math lmao
Superb! This is unbelievable good! Parabéns!
i hope you hit 50tr
This went you adult flashback your memory as teenager high school and University mathematics
Can you do next animation vs bedwars
masterpiece. absolute masterpiece
I don’t like math
HEY alan becker make green his owns skin
If Only Math Was That Easy In Real Life😞
저분 영상 많이 봤었는데 퀄 개지리네..
How does Alan make these animations in a month or so? Animator vs Animation (original) took a year to make.
This what they doing before they get captured by the weird FBI agent thingies.. or it's a different a au/alternate universe.. I wonder what animation vs animator six will be like...😅 No pressure, do what you're doing love your vids ❤️
Beautiful use of imaginary and real world with circle, exponential and functions. Mind-blowing ❤
that's why you need learn math. if someday you'll find yourself in this dimension, you will definitely come back
Can i ask you. When will you continue that wanted?
10:59 Why did the center of the circle move when I just increased the radius? 🤔
Alan. This is so insane animation about in math wow so cool😮,❤❤❤❤
alan, could you make Animation Vs Character AI
I can't understand maths in animation also
Another episode of math please
전  이캐릭터들이  최애입니다
wow alanbecker how  are you so good of  math 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
HOW THE DEATHSTAR WAS MADE
Alan I love your videos I’ve been watching u for 6 years

His math teacher is the proudest person in the world
my brain in MATH class
Fantastik!
Pov me when I’m doing my math homework
thank you Alan for the math lesson
really original!
orange always gets powers in ANY video tbh
Oh~ So cute. I really like it. I want to see it again.❤
4:16 -e^iπ =-cos(π)+isin(π)!.  Although the result does not change because "-isin(π)" or "+isin(π)" both = 0.  But expanding "-e^iπ" we get "-e^iπ =-cos(π)-isin(π)"
Me on my math test
I wish my brain is like this…
Wow!! It's really emotional😢 I love math😁
How wonderful!!? I really appreciate it and there are no words to describe how great this video is!!!
13:35 hey, that's the symbol of the phyrexians 😂
👍
Make one on chemistry too
Masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥
Math is way to confusing
I thought I was watching a netflix movie
Bro make nice video
so good, i like this
how much math did you do?
Ill save this video cus theyre soo good and cool at animating man
makes me want to do math
World's best imaginary video ❤❤❤❤
This is Masterclass!
You're my childhood bro
HI EVERYONE
WOW amazing visualization
Stikmen
Next up: animation vs music
cool👍
Point 100000
why did you all did not understand anymore
😊😊😊
I want plushiessss Alan I love ur vids
This was an awesome video! 0:01 start of the video, 14:01 end of the video. Edit: Anyone else agree that Alan Becker is an absolutely amazing YouTuber? Shoutout to Alan’s lead animator and his team for making this animation, and Alan himself for creating the idea for this video!
I never knew I’d love math so much till I watched this video
I used to watch alan walker 6 years ago and remember he had not many subscribers at the time. Me thinking about his 20m milestone makes me feel overwhemeld
As the legendary Keanu Reeves once said...     ...  WHOA!
fantastic
This is the best thing I have seen this year for sure. The animation, the idea, the scripting everything was so unbelievably magical. Props to you and your team for making such an amazing video💕🫂
What I don’t get is that; if e^🥧i multiplied themselves by i to become imaginary thus escaping SC, why didn’t i immediately jump into the imaginary plane when SC first discovered it in 3:49?
Math is like space because it's endless  If your iq is 9999999999999  You can make a time travel or teleport
와.... Great...!!!!
This is amazing ❤️✨
did any one see that creature at the end?!
This guy makes bank🤯
Helo no se ingles pero este video me dejo la cabesa sin neuronas wtf🤯
Bro el stickman aprendio en menos de media hora lo q ni siquiera yo he aprendido en su totalidad (no me han pasado ni logaritmos xd)
pokemon part 2
I have never cared about math so much in my entire life while watching this. Truly, a piece of art.
I never see maths like that it is osome and mind-blowing video
Beautiful
I Almost cry and happy
This is one of the only times i actually paid attention to math
Que cosa más hermosa! Excelente animación.
I learned more about math from this video than from school
Orange: uhm....actually 🤓🤓🤓
this video called me bad at math in 1562 languages 💀 but either way this is amazing!
sigue asi men esta cosa que haces es  de lo mejor que hay en youtube congrats
Bro learned about the Calculator App
I need a happy ending for king orange in animations vs MC
My brain is burning
Eulers number moment
Wow
⁹ What's wrong 😢 Yes I did😮
A partir del minuto 1:40 no entendí absolutamente nada
Can anyone explain the philosophy behind this video? Thanka
Why eipi?
Animation vs SKIBIDI TOILET please
If this is what orange can do imagine blue
Учим с одёлтым математику
Orange stickthigure has s big brain
How I wish you create story From basic math numbers to another level like physics.😂 Projectile, Heat, or, Power😂
If this man made a school I would ask him to make these videos instead of dumb videos
º
Did he die???
Where can i get the music ?
Richard waterson playing calculator (Not hard ) :
This made math fun
It’s awesome how it all starts from 1. Then an equal sign appears, and the math begins to slowly evolve through addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, exponents, decimals, square roots, fractions, and then into calculus with summation, pi, infinity, etc.; then into geometry with circles, radiuses, sine-, cosine-, and tangent waves. And finally, it ends with an epic battle of e vs. Second Coming. This is legitimately one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen!
We need more fan subtitles
Only Alan Becker can make an epic fight scene between a stick figure and math
this is absolutely astounding! treatin math like a magic system almost feels obviously intuitive
4:50 imagine a video game of this..😍🤩
Nerd be like:

animation is better than math
Can't believe what a content😢😊
Absolutely wonderful. I LOVE math ❤ ✖️➕➖➗
Wow the maths is beautiful!
What a great animation and good work .. i cant express how I liked this video. Mathematics is always amazing and wonderful
Animation Vs. Terraria??? Anyone ???
I literally played with the numbers
Holy shiiiiiy this is amazing!
My mind blows with this
Know this is how you make math cool 😂
Woww
Bune amina
This is by far the most fascinating and amazing video I’ve ever witnessed in my life. I am weak at math but the fact that it interested me. Amazing is too little of a word to describe the video. Great job to the team. ❤
this is SO fun
The video: complex math My βrαιη 011011001 011010101 0111011000
My first time in this channel and I am surely able to say that is mind blowing 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
foi postado no meu aniversário
жаль, что далеко не все поймут в чём же дело)))) действительно тонко))))) не так уж много и образованных в наше время, кто знает, почему это так интересно и необычно)))) *soyjak.jpg*
Animation and Mario pleaseeeeeeee!!!
it was just too wonderful to watch, even for a mathematic hater like me
why is it only orange?
My brain cells cant comprehend this massive math problems my head is fried to the brim of extinction
Как бы это двусмысленно не звучало ,но математика Грозное оружие?
This makes me want to learn math again
Hi
El video casi me parte la ultima neurona
Bro is the thinker
Рк
It’s strange that this time it doesn’t seem like it’s taking place in the computer,I am going to take an educated guess and say that it is in a calculator. Anyways even when he isn’t in the computer,his friends are always there, this isn’t the case, this is obviously hinting towards something🤔
Just imagine someone making a game like this where if you know how to do complex math you have op weapons before beating the first round
Simpley lovely
you have a big brain tho!!!!

How to make this stickman.about it please upload vidio
man all the maths
e^-3.14159 is what we mainly see
It just keeps better and better!
This single 14 minute video taught me more math then 9 years at school.
Genius 🙂
Do with their gender!!!!!😫😫😫😫😫😫😫
와우
In a nutshell, Kei-san has a lot of mathematics.I mean, I have a lot of calculation friends...
I love WEEEEEH sound
I can't put in words how fenomenal is this. Absolutely awesome.
Mesmerising 🤯🤩
This is so beautiful and joyful and strangely moving. Numbers are so inextricably intertwined with music and art and life, seeing them at play like this is like seeing them finally be able to experience the delights of being alive directly themselves, rather than through their infinitely many arbitrarily large unfoldings that make up the feeling substance of life. At the end when the other weird and beautiful numbers joined Euler's identity and the view panned back to show the big guy was Aleph I found myself crying. It was like they were a loving family, happy to be reunited. I can't explain it but it made me feel connected and hopeful and beloved and it was cathartic. So thank you for this video, and for that feeling.
Simplismente fantástico
Someone Did Meet This Because I Meet Theses All Long Time❤
999 + 999= 1998 (TRUE)
Wtf even is this its awesome ºe
This is why I learn math
Hello Alan! I don’t think you will see this  But long before I had this account a used to watch you, it’s been almost 3 years now! Your content is amazing and I love Animations! I am hoping I can one day become as good as you
디쓰 쏘 굿
*Maths is important, do your HW*
13:36 I loved that moment
10/10
Just because I had maths till A-level that I could barely understand this holy shimoly man!
Wow. Just wow.
That's why the maths teacher always says math is fun 😊😊
Is cool but i hate math
Math would be my favourite subject if it was like this 🤩 btw your animation is so cool! Great job 👍
Make part 2❤
bro taught me math better than my actual math teacher 💀
This is how most mathematicians see equations in their head no cap
you should do stickman Vs text
One of the best movies I seen so far
I can't wait for the next episode of animators Versus animation
Bro tryna catch an e^(iπ)
Animation vs wither storm
e i n Super
That is perfect
Um dos vídeos mais criativos e inteligentes no detalhes que já assisti! Acredito que será um incrível gatilho para incríveis novos matemáticos no mundo. 💟♾️☯️
I’m getting smarting watching this

Bro really taught people arithmetic in 14 minutes when people spend years to learn it 💀
Amigo es increible como funciona realmente la matematica. Grande alan ❤
I'm at a loss of words, such a masterpiece cannot be described
Peak animation
This Visio makes math look way more magical and exciting. Well done 😊❤
It's great to see such a masterpiece. I hope to see my second part 😊😊
this is so freaking genius. makes me want to hug the producers so bad!
Wait so TSC still has some numbers and equations in his inventory... I feel like for some reason that will be important later on
skibidi toilet has taken  ava and avm 😂😂😂😂
Never have I been so invested in maths
Everything is fine when it is numerical but when the alphabets come in...
I hate math ):
I have never enjoyed a math vidio more then this one 😜
Need his netflix movie😂
Bud 💀know math than we do😭
Holy moly. That was more epic than the newest transformers movie!
That felt like a movie
수학이 재밌어 졌네
This is the only time some one has to use math besides basic calculation in life
how i feel doińg a  match exam
This is epic!
Kinda wanna see Animation vs Programming now
like video i love
DUDE I WANT THE OG MATH😢🤧
Wooow...just woooow 😮 👏
pls teach me math like this way
This all started with 1+1 lol
after this video the sine and cosine was interesting for me 😅 (Idk what it this)
I hate math
bro is learning math
Котак жеме
that was one of the most impressive videos I've seen on youtube, absolutely incredible work
HO MY GOD THIS VIDEO HIT 20M VIEWS CONGRATS ALAN!! AND ALSO THIS VIDEO IS INSANE!!!!!
It's a shame that I don't master mathematics at such a level that everything makes sense to me. But it's awesome.
I think this fighting is related to Human and AI in the future, “upgrade and change” also for both❤❤
That was amazing, that felt like watching a movie in a strangely special way. As if watching this video alone fills your Youtube quota for the day. Not many things fill you up like that in such a short amount of time.
You are the goat
Animation VS the Battle cats
The scream💀 10:00
Also e to the pi i is the most confusing concept that I still cannot grasp
I'm such a nerd lol
OMG!!!❤❤👍🏆
Math lore be like:
Although I am lost at the more complicated equations, this was still a fantastic experience, and the math that I did know was very well demonstrated. Easily one of my favorite videos of all time.
??????????
Ugh my brain hurts
MASTERPIECE
Это просто неописуемо... Очень красиво и аккуратно.....
Alan, would be a masterpiece if one day you get all the universes of all the videos and mix in just one universe with a big challenge to the sticks, as a ultimate video 😮

The sign that got scared make me sad at start he just try defend himself
Dang I used to watch this when I was younger he brings back nostliga
guys, i just though about this, the pig in Alan Beckers videos, is tecnoblades soul, because how overpowered the pig has been in every video the pig has never lost really at all. is this right or not
NAHH COMPANYS BETTER START HIRING MY GUY
now i understood and liked math, thanks.
I remember an animation game Stickman vs animator 2 I tried to search for it but nothing appears, does anyone remember
Can you make a part two
Alan Becker is one of my favorite YouTubers, and he's my favorite animator. I love all the awesome stuff He, and his team does.
bro idk how, but it's amazing. You teached my better than 8 years inmy shool.
please make a seiries about this this is so good
I barely understood any of this, but it's still super cool, and I now have a greater respect for mathematics
I love when orange use the bow was sick
I can’t understand after the 1+1 thing
This is a masterpiece which could potentially pique children’s interest in maths!. So far, this is the best action movie in 2023!.

Bello Alan :)
Amazing
hardest video i’ve ever seen
bro made us a whole math lesson RESPECT TO ALAN BECKER
Somewhere in the middle I stopped understanding what was going on...
I love this so much. It's the same cleverness that this series has always had, making really creative use of UI elements, Minecraft mechanics, etc. but with math, you just have a blank slate and infinite potential. There's still so much more that could be done with this concept, so I personally hope there's a sequel but even as a one-off this is just brilliant.
Why am I more stupid then orange
pov:richar jugando calculadora
10:00 WWWWAAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!
how do you project this?? it is naturally correct  ...
What font did you use?

I am a person who took math even I am not that great in math. But honestly this is amazing how he represented all the stuff in here.
E are good
Why dont you make some game?
animation vs terraria a journey arrives
TBH I've been using youtube for 18 years now and this is probably on the top 5 of most impressive things I've ever seen here. Congrats
eagerly waiting for what happend next
Please make a video about garry's mod

Привет а можно сделать анимация против террария если да то я очень благодарен буду и рад
if i didnt know how to do math i would watch this video and instantly become albert einstein
Wow!!! It's just wonderful...... I love it ❤❤❤❤
how you made a video out of math is so satisfying to watch lol
Beni matematik bilgim videonun 4. Dakikasınds bitti
Amazing.
this made me love math and get higher grades LOL keep this up pal
😢thank you ❤
I only understood a lil
I have no idea what all that was, but this was beautiful
I like this :)
your animations are amazing!!!
Have you ever put a fake ad in the vid for the vid that would be funny
Nunca me canso de ver.
If the math lesson is like this, it makes me feel at home automatically 😅
Bros got the kali sticks
Amazing! I think I have fallen in love with math again thanks to this amazing video of yours. Thank you very much for making such a wonderful and delightful video. ❤
10:03 EEEEEEEEEEE
The true way to teach Mathematics
Man its been so long since ive watched him tho the channel aint in its prime its still doing well😊
C'est vraiment très bien réalisé, Bravo 👍👍
This is astonishing. I just loved it, I want to be able to have all these concepts on my fingertips so I can enjoy the last few minutes of the video as much as I could enjoy the first half. Sound effects are absolutely delightful. Makes me watch again and again and escape into the world of mad mathematics.
I want wanted ep2

@MathemaTrick musst du dir angucken :)
How 2 make math fun
The sound design on this is blockbuster level.
Insane 😱
OMG
Anyone who doesn't know math be scratching their heads like crazy
You inspired me with  animation vs minecraft episodes 20-30
I’m not actually deleted Alan….. I’m still here.
Can you imagine Alan doing an anger of stick man animation? It would be amazing.
I have no idea how you managed to make math this epic
what masterpiece is this!!!
and they say match "IS NOT FUN"
dislikes are euler's cult
Doesn't it sound like jab tak jaha me subah shaam hai
I watched the first 3 second and l fallen to sleep
Monster Aleph comes at the end :)
Alan and his team did an absolutely masterpiece!
absolutely amazing
13:02 Masterclass with Gamma Function :)
This is 100/10
10:15 L'idée d'utiliser le calcul intégral comme un sabrolaser et la trainée laissée par le sabre en mouvement est l'aire générée par l'opérateur intégral... C'est juste merveilleux :)
Why simple math make me so confused
Does anyone know which is this function with kind of a left vector on it 8:33 ?
Wanted Ep 2 So what
Bro was tryharding in math 💀
man i wanna be a math teacher now just to show this masterpiece to some kids

The sound design here is simply masterful, and makes the whole thing feel physical and *very* satisfying.
Number is infinite if you have a number then you change it to a infinite number you can get like pi. Pi is random and infinite but not infinite so choose wisely what you put the number you put is the hard number you make
Alan and his team would definitely used a calculator to animate this
I have to say, it's a work of art😍
I don't really know anything about math but this was awesome
I'm becoming more and more curios about how such kind of animation can be actually made😊
что что
10:04 великолепный момент
Não entenderam eu também não
Love these videos but clearly math isnt my subject cause this confussed tf out of me🤣🤣🤣
This Amazing dude. I love that so much ❤
This is a masterpiece which could potentially pique children’s interest in maths!. Utterly delightful!.
Try continuing the animation with the scene Minecraft creative mode vs Minecraft baby mode vs Minecraft using the toolbox... It should be fun
AMAZING
How to give multiple likes on a single video?
Это шедевр!
Bro I understand math now better because of this ToT
Спасибо Алан Бейкер за все азы математики!
it awesome
Based on true story)
Exploration of Limit and irrational numbers is awesome 😎😎
animation vs. chemistry at the atomic level will be sick
I didn’t know what half those math things were, nor what the ending truly meant, but it was still awsome
My brain almost exploded when I watched thí
That was good
Es muy bueno el video ya que si te da paja leer un libro podes el contenido de Alan Becker para estudiar!!!
Bro make video from Bio vs animation.
i dont know what i feel when i say this is what my dreams look like. numbers like infinity, i , pi, and e shits scary af
Super cool
Only maths student can understand 😂
Super conceptual video
Animation vs code after? Like html, java, c#, c++?
If you think about it, this is actually a mathematical video for students from easy to difficult, so if you want to educate your students this video is the best option.
me: I'd like to give an award to the person who taught me math! teacher: stands up me: SIT DOWN, i aint talking to YOU Orange stickman: walks to the stage 'shakes hands' me: give him a round of applause!
Hi Alan Becker
ALOF NOLE
알렉님 구독자인데 이거 아직도 안본다?      걍 구독자 하지마~~~~
Excuse me this isnt suppose to be cool your cheating
e¡π
This is a masterpiece.  So clever and creative--even moving.  I think every kid should watch this, because it could spark an interest in learning all the math that goes into it.
His team is godly bro like really..
1+1=11
This makes me want to learn math now😂
Alan, all of your animations are well done and smooth nothing wrong in any of them. I thought about becoming an animator. Anyways keep pumping out these bangers!
the robot: is time for you to end  me: 10:40
Absolutely loved this.
Animation V.S animator VI ep 2 PLEASE
El poder de la matemática
I like math, but I am just a kid so I got most of none of this. But this is so awesome, as is everything you make. Thank you so much for being an awesome animator👍
Can you do animation vs roblox pls
wow
Well, done Sir! I was not a huge fan of math in school, but I have grown an interest in it over the last few years. This was mind boggling AND entertaining. It would be nice if you did more videos like this (like maybe vs. physics). But, please, please, keep animating.
Part 2      👇
10:02 🤣
Real math 💯
Orange could also use the ball as a decimal point.
i like when my brain hurt, im hurting now °.D
Negative one equals i
I like the second coming to
12:16 e loves Orange now!
Animation vs. Physics
well damn
I absolutely LOVE the sound effects
e
bro learned more 10x more math than me in 14 minutes
Its like been 2 weeks and alerdy got 841K like
WE'RE ESCAPING THE NEGATIVES WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i just learned so much stuff about math...  im going to 5th grade and i think i know everything up to 7th grade.
Looks like im learning math animations.
This was super cool, I wonder how it could've went if we had the whole crew playing with math lol.
Now I wanna learn math
I imaginate alan becker find in the calculator the questions XDD                 Ñ
my brain hurts from wating this but i still like ur vids
Alan es un GENIO!!!!!!!!!!!!
The א
Now that’s educational
Aleph is so scary and powerful
ficou fantástico mas eu me pergutaria o trabalho que deve ter demorado pra fazer
Alan Becker idea Sonic vs animation por favor 😅
Quien era el gigante
OMG THIS IS JUST PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!😻😻😻😻❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hola chicos hoy vamos a jugar un nuevo juego que hay en mi computadora, se llama calculadora...

Creative ppl smh
Plot twist this is actually a simulation created by the people who took orange and black to test the smartness of orange
Teacher: test will be easy Test:
Give Me A Equation Ok
😍👍
You never realize how much math you know or want to until you watch an intriguing show about math. Then you want to learn it all.
This shows how strong the second coming is.
Beautiful work
That was fucking amazing
3:20 in another universe, its called random access memories or RAM.
Knowledge is the strongest weapon in the world
And if animation vs Plants vs Zombies gardem warfare existed?, I'm a big fan of yours! hope you like the idea :)
This could be a movie
I wish i was as good as you at animation heck it dosent even look smooth when I try but no matter how hard i try it will never be good
Asi si da ganas de aprender mate😹
El mejor video del mundo
Bro really made the E movie 😂
This was amazing
Question for anyone that knows, what is the background music?
Starwars is nothing compared to this. Love it!
pls
what is the name of the program that you use to make animation in I want to know
Bro thanks…I don’t need school no more 🥳
❤❤
beautiful i dint knew that you will take us to the imaginary plane
bros just descoverd an infanant time loop
I don’t know if you done this yet but can you make a video where the stickman mess around with the inspect element
Would be great to see this same idea For Physics and chemistry as well.
That's super cool
Alan is very clever
If the stick figures crawl out of a charging port or a printer, do they become real?
master piece
Plz make part. 2🤗
these animations are honestly impressive
And there goes the aleph in Null in the end
the + end = thend
That was the best unraveling of math I have ever seen in my entire life.
Alen try to make, Animation vs Meme
when will you release the second part of wanted
I was waiting for integration to show up
animation vs science when?
idk what’s happening, my brain hurts does anyone else’s brain hurt
did i just learn math again by animation
This vid is a masterpiece I definitely understand all and how does it, everything,without an calculator
Is orange going to have the power of math to manipulate the desktop now because he learned how it works?
Did TSC fr make a death star out of numbers
—вау.. у меня нет других слов. Это выглядит невозможно!
No words...
Animation vs War thunder
Wow that is all I can say Wow This was the BEST animation I have ever seen in my life perfect this is a master peace this is an artwork of animation and math really really good job
Me who stopped understanding after (i)
i want moreeee
The most créative animation Nevers seen in my life whit phisices and anything
At the beginning I thought orange was a piece of orange string on my phone so when I try to blow it off I realized it.
Mom I got math problem. The math : skrrraaaaa boom
This video taught me more than school ever could😂
Can you do Animation vs. Javascript. Please 🙏🏻
just OP🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
999999999999999
This is the best animation movie i ever seen 😮
4:42 bros got the crucifix 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
i still don’ t understand math
this should be a video game
wow
I didnt watch this chanal for a while and omg thers so meany memorys
This is the best..... best....... the bestest way to learn maths I loved this video this is the best video on the entire yt bro I really loved it we want more such videos please please........ It's a request please................ its the perfect x->5 lim(10+x-5) on x->5 lim(10+x-5)
폼 미쳤다
DUDE IS DOING SERIOUS MATH
Даааа, математика наука сложная и ёмкая, а в школе говорили "не пригодится в жизни". Пригодилось 😂 Алан, супер 👍
It’s amazing when you understand
part 2 where his friends join
Why do I want my school to show me this I would actually listen then
at 4:16 there is a small mistake.. it should be -cos(π)-isin(π) or maybe im wrong cuz im not reallt good at math
You're welcome alan for the views. Maybe that'll help.
Im talking to YOU live chat : )
Im not mr beast. Im not a streamer. Not a youtuber. Just a fan.
This feels like transformers
This feels so weird but so fitting.
Im still in high school guys.
🇱🇷 just so you know.
i may be mistaken but is the big thing in the end that letter "א" in hebrew?
This is fun to watch. With people at the same time.
Bro made math more fun than my university professor.
Its called self awareness.
Call me anything. A nerd can be a compliment after all right?
Please make an app or game out of this concept of animation and utilisation
man this is so cool
I'm so glad I can relate to something.
Alan, you studied mathematics at 5+
Simply Outstanding!!
I’m Japanese. I thought your movie was great!
El reino de las matemáticas un lugar misterioso
It got me when the character start to vanishing the numbers by function at ♾️ and the monster absorbed total energy with limitation. Well done it’s amazing
We need a part 2!i
Please do more parts!
Omg that's so cool, I hate math but I loved this video 💗
Imagine this is just a sequel of animation vs animator bout putting TSC in some kind of experiment like this
nice
What happened at the end?
Hi Alan! Math is a good subject I like it! Mostly I like science tho. Have a great day!
Math is multiverse, that's I see in this vid
My man was creating a whole universe
Maths had never been this interesting
Students' minds be like during math class:
:-3>
This video is inside
I feel like the sin+cos combo was cool in a way, but I still don’t know what they mean as I’m only soon going to 8th grade, but I’ll learn when the time comes and rewatch this again  Edit: guessing it’s like some sort of oscillating thing as a wave as depicted in this, and double oscillation on both the X and Y axis would mean like a moving dot on a plane, which in programming could be a moving platform, that’s just my guess though and I have no idea what this is  Edit2: diagonally on both btw, and this is already very long because of my curiousness and guessing so if anyone in a higher grade could answer me I would appreciate it
Somehow this is more understand able than my teacher explain
orange stick figure can be a good math teacher
This video describes my feelings towards Math from 8th to 12th grade.
I love your amazing work but may you please make animations vs terraria
I remember watching Animator vs Animation when it first came out. This is insane how time flies
great ,,alan
I learned something
Impossible
imagine people power scaling this
Orange: dont mind me just gonna break the fourth wall
Masterpiece
10:56 NAH 💀
Спасибо!
Next video will be Animation vs. Alphabet
It's so amazing!!! Love from China❤
Nice video 👍
this movie will be the origin story of some future mathematicians
Jzboy and alan becker plisss
Beautiful
Andi Ada skibidi toilet disitu  Dan kameramen
Exclusive talent!!!...Maybe Animation Vs Music ?!? It'll be great!!!
Bro what is this math, its making me go -1iQ
All of this animation started with Minecraft
that was pretty cool do part 2!
😮s
‘e’ is truly a scary entity😨 This video is so accurate! I especially loved how ‘i’ works as a interdimentional portal 😂
The fact that this all started from 1 😂😂
Можно русскую озвучку пж😢😢😢
hermoso
How did they even get there??
Aleph
e(iπ) is euler's formula or euler's identity
Ki bala video bee
Who knew math could be that entertaining
this is beyond genius
New idea: animation vs baldi
Show this to your kids
Add a stickgirl on history
God, I've never felt the wonder and greatness of math so truly. This work brings me to tears
I took honors precalc last year and have no idea what's going on
I can't even explain how amazing this is!
Hey alan becker do animation vs pokemon white
just watched the worm video
Hi i am new and i already subcribe and keep up the good work😊😊
Soy malo para las matemáticas 🧮 🌚 Me cerebro 🧠 sufrió un corto circuito pero no paré dé sentirme en una película dé matrix!
I've watched this whole series in 2 or 3 days and I cant believe how long it was But how short it felt. I love your videos, I love the stickmen too, I even love the bad guys I love all the characters, This is the best series I've ever seen, I just wanna say, Thank you, Alan. Thank you for Everything. Your the best animator I've ever seen, Goodbye. 🤍🖤🧡❤💛💚💙💜🧡
if you think about it, this is just the world explained in  a story like fashion
alan continues animation vs minecraft please??
So Amazing...
This animation is cool, so cool, but my head pain because figuring out how is this work
This Is cinema men wooooo increíble
Việt nam ơi :))))
Việt nam ơi :))))
qeustion .alan would you ever or have you ever tried animating on sticknodes?
If Alan makes animation vs Minecraft dungeons ima be very happy and Impressed and Im Already blown away from this video
I want wanted 2
Wish I understood math better to get the most out of this. Still, what an entertaining video!!! Thank you!
WoW Props for that. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
10:02 I'm not going to lie, seeing that E scream like that gives me tenderness and laughter at the same time
i x i x i = -i
Wow
Teachers: 1+1=2 Homework: 5x(3-2) The test:
That ℵ there sneaking around at the end felt kinda foreshadowy
A Very big respect to this guy who made me understand math😂😂
Next animation vs physics ❤
Alan becker use 2000000 iq
What a fun way to show math. The concept of Algebra, Trigonometry, and Calculus are well represented here.
This is very easy bro 1+1=3 look so easy
I wonder how proud the math teacher of the guy who made the math in this vid is. 😂
Pls do rooms low detailed
Failed math
Can we take a minute and talk about the music composer and whoever designed the sound for the main character and the numbers 🔥🔥🔥 They have done a fabulous job.
2:20 I like how TSC can put items in an inventory even outside of Minecraft
YOU GOTTA LOOK AT @catgod904 SHE ANIMATED AN ANIMATION ABOUT A DUEL WITH YOUR CHARACTERS! *watch till the end bc it’s funny!*
Talk about the math movie
I feel like I’ve seen the Euler’s character style somewhere else….that movement, the smart ass part at the end, I can’t recall but I know I’ve seen it somewhere….is it just me?
You trying to get new crafting on gourmet
This taught me more then school
I got so lost so fast lol
I feel like I’m a passOut
How does he edit and get this stuff?
Huuu
This guy is over powered
H,m
What will this equal to?
What about everything connected to math all together?
What about dividing plus times what will it make?
If this stuff is connected to math, what about dividing plus times
but
Alan you need make part 2 of vitcm the return
My brain is hurting
Are we just gonna ignore the giant thing walking in the backround of the last scene?
Thanks... 🙂
I think its easier to understand math if im watching this
This is by far the cutest thing i have ever seen
Fortnite
It made me sad, since I couldn't understand math no matter how hard I tried. (And I tried a lot.) It's not like I am completely lost. I always loved geometry, since it is needed to my specialty. But these complex formulas (I know it is not so complicated in fact) made me lost... Another problem is every time mt teachers used different type of writing... I never even used i. I've always wrote -1^1/2
Part 2? (please im begging)
Hello soy un nuevo seguidor se que tengo la sensación de que me escucharas bueno si ves este comentario un nuevo video podría ser un short de the second coming vs lord orange cooll seri la batalla jajaja bueno adiós
これまじですごい
Essa é a melhor ilustração que já vi se fizesse um filme não precisaria nem de fala só a simplicidade e a complexidade de outras coisas ao mesmo tempo combinado já diz tudo, é d+ 😉👍
Casi pone el número chistocho el más me
Song name?
I am watching this after smoking a joint. And this is beautiful.
This aint MATH This is  MAsTHerpiece
Math go boom boom and enemy go bye bye
Can you please
Can you patient animation vs math be a Seres plz pls(please)
I love thisss anime it’s soooo cooool
Beautiful
Umm…when will episode 2 wanted be uploaded? Please the first EP was beautiful 🤩
This has more character development than most things produced by hollywood these days
Alan becker: that one teacher who make math not boring and easy to understand
Let's say that even for those who have difficulty understanding math, they have no problem understanding most of what's going on here.
WOW👍
BOOTIFUL math!! :D
Я НИЧЕГО НЕ ПОНИМАЮ
A master piece
I literally have no words the only thing i’ll say is…… MASTERPIECE 🔥this is to good to be tru :o
Ay wey mi mente 😨
So cool!
El inteligente del salon cuando esta aburrido:
I was an amazing video. I really enjoyed it. Great Work ❤️❤️
I sent this to my math teadcher
Hello Alan, your animations are very nice and I want to do it too, which application or site are you using?
я после 1+1 перестал ничего понимать
Finally i found the full video, It is really awesome, from elementry to some major concepts of math in very entertained way. Thanks to the whole team. Really curious to learn about some of the end concepts of this video.
Science vs animation ❤
He hases now the power of math
Literalmente no entendí nada
amazing is not enough for that video  but did the e killed him at the end?!
why is this teaching. e math?       I LOVE IT
Animation vs Physics next. Let TSC get from throwing stuff and gravity to electricity and then quantum mechanics
Reminds me of calc 2 and learning integration techniques
10:03  Euler's is so cute   e¡3,14
Honestly he went from kindergarten to college in like 10 seconds or so
BRILLIANT  Deserves to be awarded with the highest honors!
Now I have to ask, how old is TSC and the others?
Incredible. Just... wow.
Bro made me check my math
Now every math channels has  bread
I have absolutely no idea what I just watched. But i am absolutely in love with it
Would there be a chemistry version?😮
you should make a fnaf stick figure movie
Animation vs tictok???
What is the name of this type of sound effect?
8:28 π = pi?
I was hooked lol
Great animation!!!
AMAAZIIIIIINGGGGGGGG😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
10:00 the dark lord of math as spawned in the math world.
هو ايه ده بقا؟؟🤔🤔
Like how e^(iπ) became his friend to save its own "imaginary" world from destruction
I love math now 🤓
When we needed him, *he came back.*
simplemente épico!
would love to see animation vs math ALEPH BOSS FIGHT
This guy might soon find out what 4th dimension is..😂❤. Goodwork..!
could you make an animation video vs demon slayer
Huge respect to the concept, the artist, the method of presentation, the sound editor, the math brainer everyone.  This is one of the best works I have seen of you, I have been following you for years. Literally this is the best I have ever seen.  maybe because I am a math nerd tooo.
When math is cool.
Welp i guess we are clearing math problem wih this now
Man I can't wait for Animath 2
every year of algebra and calculus is literally flashing before my eyes
The fact that this is what I imagine math as is so funny, it's way more fun to watch this than to be in math class
When someone say math is boring Just show this video
Whats the background music? Been tryin to shazam it, but all the sound effects through it off, so i cant get anything
Youtube bu videoya yaptığı yorumu mu silmiş?
DO DND OR A MARIO GAME AND IF YOU DO THE DND YOU COULD SHOW US THE STORY AND CHARACTERS LIKE orange is the gm and green can be a palidan
Just amazing! God

From moroco i really like this video i have watched it for many times
1+1=2 Without unnecessary philosophy
Actually this animation helped me with math stuff  Also pretty funny i like it
Me when I’m doing my math homework
Why i dont UNDERSTAND what this mean why u make this
Alan Becker i love your videos and don’t stop making videos!
bro both got a ♾ iq
Can you make more videos like this please
I don’t know why, but this video reminds me of that motorcycle fight/race scene in tron. The music is almost the same 🤣
if math can be this interesting
Is this the end of alan becker?😢
Alan seus vídeos são animações parecendo até Dida real pois disso você é melhor (i'm Brazilian but i know speak english not so much)
i'm from russia  7:34 как e стала знаком суммы
Ok syg tq cikgu nanti tolong bagi tahu
I feel so stupid watching this
This explained maf good
So good
hello sir The content is very good and I have really liked animation like this since a long time ago if I may give permission to re-upload the video on my Chanel.  hopefully quickly respond🙏🙏🙏🔥
amazing
AMAZING!!! Congrats. But you lost the chance to call it AniMathion. 😊😊 lol
CHOOSE ALAN, RED WİRE OR BLUE WİRE? WİLL YOU BE AGENT SİMİTH OR NEO?
These is literally me when im trying to solve math and suddenly get an error
Absolutely amazing!!
This is so cool

*Math is now my favorite :)*
Part 2:infinity come
Ain’t no way bro turned math into weapons 4:43 I wonder if he’s gonna do other subjects like science or english
20 mio views and 800k likes on a math video :D
You need an award
WANTED ep2 pls
I've waited 17 years for this 👏
Grade 1 to College in 14 Minutes
Wish, my math teacher teaches like this!
прикольное видео жалко я тупой
I mesn second coming😂😅
Why he doing math better than me
10:00
When alan becker make ep 2 animator vs animation
this animation is from another dimension.
Day 16 of begging to make a game
ur animations have improve over the years keep up the good work
T
We have AvaS1,AvaS2,avm,and avm (I think there is more but I’m not going to search it)
이과가 보면 재밌는영상
Wow
alan that soooooooooo cool
such an amazing content
Very good
Does anybody know how he made the ambient noises? For example when the radius of the circle expanded. Just curious. Thanks
Could be relatable to my brother that has math problem....
In the background can you see aleph null
this video taught me more math than my math teacher
This is a masterpiece which could potentially pique children’s interest in maths!
When you want to be an animation designer but your parents want you to be a mathematician.
The Second Coming, more like the Second Mathematian
Nerds fighting be like😂
alan I have a question that I wanted to ask for a long time, what is the gender of the characters? I want a video and it says their gender because this made me confused.
Please dont tell me we are gonna have Blue vs Science
how to make a shot gun: 1. f(inf)
Just imagine Animation vs Physics or vs Programming
Ultron?
TSC is a fast learner
20M Views In 2 Weeks... HOW IN THE HOLY HELL IS THAT POSSIBLE
Wait TSC is already the god of stick men now he's the god of mathematics dang TSC is now overpowered
1+1--2
e^iπ=-1
THE BEST ANIMATION
i love how this ÷ isn't same as this /
As a young programmer, this is how we use math to coordinate vectors, rays n bunch of stuff for a tasteful gameplay.
I love math combinated with what is Alan Becker
Halo mas amrin
Who was coming from Instagram😅😅😅
Such snappy animation, oh my goodness. Beautiful.
I'm Asian and I don't understand most of it 😥
Wow Alan has come a long way and blew up too, when did that happen
Never knew math was so deadly. And GREAT ANIMATION MY GUY.
Fun fact: the large N in the end is alpha null (the set of all numbers out there, and the goofy looking shapes are different sets of infinities, while (N) warps everything up.
Only Alan could make Math fun and entertaining :P
Bro really made an accurate representation of what it’s like to be in Math class 1/4 the way through :P
0:12 hahah! Ha…. *O N E! :D*
If only math was this fun 😭😭😭
The sound that the robot made 😂
I got an adapted mind ad during this video the algorithm is so strange
EPIC
Orange just learned more about maths in 5 minutes than the teachers can teach us in 2 years.
Me after fliping my calculator sideways
When you turn the calculator app sideways:
somebody should make a game with these weapons and make crafting these
I want to see a really smart math enthusiast to react to this
This shows, that math is very cool
Don’t go to college,just watch this video
This is the only reason i wanna  learn math
Bro went from doing Pre-K math to winning that one boss fight with Baldi
Okay Alan Becker I know you on the different country I want add friend you but I can do it okay I am you favorite YouTuber I am keep watching you videos
Nice
When will you upload videos
Oh no it’s e
It’s weird to think that the second coming has powers when he isn’t using it
Aleph at the end was lovely. Thanks. :)
1st
Это восхитительно ❤
Incradible
The aleph in the background of the end was perfect (though I was looking for the accompanying zero/null).
This is out of this world!!!
This is literally what I see when I’m messing with the calculator.
No entendí nada.
I hope he will make part 2
I find it absolutely fascinating how quickly the stick figures can adapt to and understand any world they end up in.
Bro what did i just watch ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
make a video of you all playing minecraft multiplayer
im starting to wish i studied more during geometry
This video is flawless, if they made one with music, that would be great.
In the end i didn't get it... what happened?? That was hella fire tho!!!
Bro made the death star
so he's fought herobrine, tdl, king orange and now math? WHAT IS GOING ON.
Hey Alan can you make animation vs RLcraft pls
The (e) is running
pi is a new phenomenon that has been emerging since the early sixties and has been associated in many ways with many different forms and traditions of social media including social networking sites such as Facebook Messenger for example Facebook and Google Hangouts and social networking websites like Google Play and Facebook Live to promote social media content that people can use to communicate with others online at home and online services such as social networking websites and online dating apps
Hi
Alan have you ever considered using netherite in one of the minecraft animations?
As an Art Major, the furthest I really could get was... basic algebra. Variables and such. I think the main problem is that after a point, it became so difficult for my visually-oriented mind to convert the numerics and symbols on the pages into how the actual functions were meant to work. All my poor instructors kept pointing out that my comprehension was sound, but something about... actually *solving* the equations in my mind never quite clicked. I suppose that's why I took a field as distanced from "pure" mathematics as possible!  ... Perhaps if I had a "field" like this to actually, physically poke and prod at these concepts, maybe I would have been able to grasp a lot more. Watching our little protagonist basically "discover" increasing orders of complexity, eventually going as far as to enter numeric dimensions, was a really fascinating way of translating all of this emergent mathematics into a classic Flashy Fight Scene.   It's always cool to see people translate concepts like this into something visual enough to construct a nice narrative! Well done on you and everyone else for putting this all together. It certainly was a wonderful introduction to the rest of your amazing work!
ABSOLUTE BLACK
tsc is at calculus by this time
i bet yellow would have a field day with this
cos 43 78=1+77 45=45 i tan
I learned more math here from Alan than at school lol
This is better than most animations
Hell nah, man I’m showing this to my math teacher!
I imagine that the sparks from the rad and the number clashing, are actually just every result, due to r being a variable, and thous can be anything.
I am a 12th grade math student and it made me so happy that i understood 90% of the concepts shown in the video. Absolutely amazing. I bow down to the person who came up with this video. This will go down as one of the greatest videos of all time on the platform.
I LOVED THIS!!! It’s always so cool seeing the characters Interacting with different aspects of the computer. Here’s another idea I thought about today while pouring myself a cup of water: Animation Vs Periodic Table Could be fun to see the characters messing with chemistry concepts or just messing with the periodic table and making stuff
I feel so stupid watching this video 😅
how to make math cool
The legend is back!!!
Good like always
Create some animation from terraria like minecraft or like (minecraft vs terraria) or find some terraria block and Guide coming something terraria
Excellent
How is he so smart😮

@Alan Becker I would love to do the stuff you do, but Im just not good enough
I subbed
Amazing.
I loved this video, very creative and something I never would’ve thought of man, keep it up, you are your team are doing an awesome job!!! 👍
My brain when im trying to find new math problems :
it is next level of thinking
I wanna play a game like this
Alan Walker is topper in maths on his time . am I right?
Better than most action movies
Xem xong giỏi toán luôn😂
You officially make the best animations in the world!❤️
Havent watched you in six years lets see what changed
Does anyone else feel like they understood this video more than their math teacher?
Imagine spending 21 years learning math and then you see this video.
Holy sh!t this animation look so epic and cool
What are all the stick men’s genders?
Alan Becker even made an action movie out of mathematics😂
ما تطبيق لذي تستخدمة
Wtf button 😮
I don’t understand but I like it

내 최고의 수학작품이다.창의성과 액션,수학의 규칙들을 이용한점이 매우 마음에 들었다.앞으론 수학 좋아하게 될듯 It's my best math work.I liked the fact that I used the rules of creativity, action, and mathematics.I think I'll like math from now on👍
Creative logic for kids.
This is why we should pay attention in math class
I almost cried that was a sad story
it's amazing!!!
대학교때 만들고싶은게 이런것이었는데 어려워서 못만들었었는데 진짜 잘만들었다
These are the type of videos kids need to watch , rather than minecraft. The perfect vid tons of new concepts explained from basic to veteran through a little story. KUDOS!

Did you notice that aleph is represented as "grey cardinal" of numbers? And the aleph numbers are a sequence of infinite cardinal numbers.
man just shove an entire math history in a 14min animation
WAKE UP ALAN.WELCOME TO THE MATRİX. YOU HAVE BEEN DROIDIZED. YOU'RE NOT ALONE....
Finally, math lore
Your calculation are on point
Nurlan qalam
Absolutely perfect
as a math lover student, It is vastly insane!! br0!=1
He actually played with numbers.
I have never imagined that I would witness this amount of creativity, related to math, in a youtube video. Last time I was this invested in a video, was when I watched Tenet, but this is more fun. Kudos to everyone involved in this project.
Alan Becker series is the one piece of YouTube
soft movements Nice! 🤩
Wow, your videos are amazing! Keep up the great work
So 1 plus 1=?
1+1=1+1
WOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!
Alan make a desktop pet for all devices I want the stick figures
TSC is my new math teacher.
I didn't know that math is such a cool thing!
Try to make animation vs terraria
masterpiece
As a Maths lover, this made my day, amazing video! 📈
Definitely the best Oscar Short Film!🏆

This video makes me wanna learn more abt mathematics
what happend at the end ?? where that person goes ??
Imma be real... I don't understand alot of stuff after the basics... but I'm pretty sure this video just nailed the equation for 11/10 amazing.
My knowledge of what's happening ceased to exist after the circle stuff
I think orange is albert einstein 😅
skibidi dop dop dop yes yes🚽
never in my life i would expect to go see math explanation after a video , this is really a master art
I guess he really didn't forget what he learned.
Lindo, apesar de não ter entendido 95%
When your mom says do your homework .  my imagination:
i wish there was a game like this it would make math fun
Will never look at Maths the same way ever again😂
I hate math. But I love Alan's animations 😭
Who wants Animation vs Physics!!
Yea Alan backer is 100% A+ on math welldon
🤍WHAT ON EARTH!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS - THIS IS ART+ WISDOM 🖤
There was the letter א for the Israelis as I am an Israeli

Really I would love to learn maths like this . This animation shows me the beauty of a maths for the first time bro I  am not good at maths bit whatever you made is really awesome 😂❤😊
unexpected animation as always
The music / SFX for this video are amazing
The best piece of math animation created so far!
OKAY WTF THIS I JUST WATCH
9:27 the power of infinity ♾️ 🔥🔥🔥
alan, i have idea: animation vs algorithm (programming languange)
About Chemistry 🤔
me quede en las diviciones
alan becker and his team’s creativity is endless, what an amazing and unique animation! there’s so much amazing detail and the usage of various math symbols as weapons was awesome.  The e’s fighting style reminded me a lot of clippy’s from the earlier days when he fought the chosen one
My brain is broken.. i hate math
Math teacher: I told you that you would use this!
The only math video I could understand
Pusing aying
i understand this more than i understood all my years of math in school.
BRO THIS PART 10:02 LAUGH SO HARD
Can you make this as a game please cuz I like to try it this time releases 9:03

Ive been thinking of you could do a Halloween or horror themed animation, like animation vs fnaf or animation vs, I guess Saiko no sutoka?
This is the most intense video about math I've ever seen
perfect example, if math professor is animator

My favourite subject is   math 🕤😎
I'm not kidding when I say this video should be considered for the Best Animated Short Film Oscar.
I grew up on videos like this lol
Beautiful
okk
Ay wey mi mente😩
Hi alan, is it ok if i can make a fan made video relating with your videos?
I love your videos and I’m a big fan I like the Minecraft OK
Bikin animation vs skibidi toilet pasti rame yang nonton
This is a master piece. amazing work
Sounds effects are so goooood!
I understood up to e to the i pi My brother would always be like “e to the i pi is negative 1” when we were little :)
who knew math was so entertaining
I should know more of this in a few years. Gonna major in mechanical engineering. I only lasted until 4:01, I’m going into precalc soon
me actually learning math from this 💀
What hes doing 😮
that's so coooooool
its motivates so hard to learn math
10:04  me at the exam be like
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
absolutely this is what nerds imagine when they solve math
Can I have Animation VS Ager of stick 5 zombie?
This is honestly the best math video I have ever seen.
Going into imaginary numbers is already hard enough in normal conversation. This is a great video!!
the only thing i got was 1 + 1
Hi alan becker i have good idea for your video this your the one whos gonna make the story this is my idea so make yellow blue orange got control but not green in the final fight Yellow blue orange vs green and red then red gonna get control to so green almost died from the fight the he got cornered and got stab in the heart after that blue yellow red orange are gonna walk away the green gonna have his AWAKENING i dont know the awakening form so anything ...thanks i hope you see this
"maths are complicated" Alan Becker :"DO AN ANIMATION WITH IT!"
this concept can EASILY turn into a game
I love this animation!!! ❤
10:02 WHAAAAAAA
My teacher:how do you know so much about math? Me:I watched Alan becker
I'm speechless
That’s wonderful !!!! 😮😅👍🏽💪🏽🙏🏽👨‍🏫
I dont know if you guys noticed, but at the end, when the Φ symbol appears, it approaches his buddy (e^iπ) with steps inversely proportional to 1.618, which is the golden ratio represented by "phi" Φ
For the first time i love math
My head when bored in math:
Wanted - Animator vs. Animation VI - Ep 2 ? pls
That's awsome.
One of the most mathematical videos I've ever seen!
This video kinda makes me wanna become a math major
Why are there ladders should there be only Numbers why are there letters to? I’m so confused.
But cool at the same time
This is boring
We don’t need the dark Lord
What’s the point?
Where is the dark Lord when you need him?
Can anyone explain the math that’s happening at around 6:50 like what’s is really going on ? Or when he spins the theta sign, how does that work ?
I was only able to somewhat understand anything before 7:00 Them junior high days coming back to haunt me again
Bring back somehow animator vs animation
but its still 10/10
my brain hurts because its so complex

You guys are a genius , It is amazing
I had no idea what was mathematically happening after the first quarter or so of the video but I'm here for the whole thing!
i hate math but i subscribed
Incredible a math genius 😁🤩
MATH IS SO OP BRO
among us 7u7
I'm waiting for Animation vs Programming
AI vs Animation
for some that can understand how math work this is preety cool
After this we can easily say that second coming is literally the one of the most powerful character to ever exist as he defeated someone who possessed infinite potential. Though the math entity in the end can be insanely powerful.
Final battle was amazing
The visualizations of sine and cosine were some of the clearest I've seen. Well done!
Thanks, now i love math

HEY Alan please when is the new animation coming
Math is more interesting than I thought
So math can open portals. Great
Me doing my homework
amazinganimation
🤯 wow I was so blown away by the animation format as well as the sounds that I didn't understand much of the  numerical analysis 😂, Although I will watch it again to get it😅. Thanks for this awe inspiring and informative work. Loved it ❤.
To the math nerd that did the equation and to the animator, heavily respected
I cant believe  something i watched during my first year of high school is now something so big
Wow
It is AMAZING!!!When I first saw this video, I was very excited. I didn't expect that someone could use animation to express the mystery of mathematics. I hope the author can make a sequel or something, or other science related animations. It's going to be awesome.
How is this soo good?
This needs to become a sieries like animation vs animator, thanks a ton alan
There are Japanese people other than me
이해는 안되지만 재미 있었습니다.

Woah! I have savant syndrome for math and I've never seen something so close to what it's like! I'm going to start using this as a reference for my experience. Thank you for making such a great work of art!
nerd humor is stupid wtf is this
THIS. IS. BRILLIANT!!!
I make animations
Very good
Круто! Спасибо! Получила настоящее удовольствие от просмотра!)
smart
Mathematical!
Incredible, it has a lot of work behind it and on top of that it teaches you. Great

When this video is more informative than any math class a student has
and the oscar goes to
Honestly im surprised when this one alots to make understand
love you xD. its so cool
This way math should be  tought in school
Humans can be godlike with the power of math? 🤔
7:00 I wish my teacher would have taught me this way😢
Love the little scream that the E does. Makes me think of those hamster things in Ice Age Continental Drift.
Animation vs Meth next up?
lm indonesia love matematika
It's beautiful
Mathematics boss fight
O口O！
After finishing a year of calculus myself, I can appreciate so much more than I ever realized was possible. This is truly a masterpiece and I love all of it. I was blown away and everything was perfect. Thank you for being such an inspiration to me all these years and for continuing to blow me away with everything you do. Keep being amazing!
BRO HAS BECOME ELBERT EINSTIEN
GOD'S WORK ❤
I didn't even notice Aleph until I looked this video up on the wiki today. 😂 How can something so big and loud be so easy to miss? I didn't even _hear_ it stomping until I knew it was there! Too distracted by the other symbols I guess. Doesn't help that it blends in with the background.
By far the hardest story to understand, RIP my math lol
This was incredible!
wtf, this is the stranger but coolest animation that i ever see in my life
Alan Becker should do an animation where they go find out there are Minecraft mods and finding its lore, I bet it would be really cool!
The first time math looked exciting to me 👏
Bro is so famous YouTube himself commented
Watching this made me feel smart
Real Doctor Strange
the biggest master piece of the year just love it
This is literally where I learned math
so big brain
Now i know the math
there needs to be an interactive math game like this
ez to understand. thanks for the hard work!
That may be one of the best animations I've ever seen
This is straight up genius
This educational video about meth was so cool
An stickman actually learns maths faster than my actual brain 💀
The math gets harder
This man never ceases to amaze me with his effort and dedication to every detail that he uses in all his videos. He is literally a magician in his content.
As far as i know the best ending in the history...it made me emotional 😢
Its not the same without (official) at the end
sức mạnh của toán học =))))))))))))
That WAAAAHHH at 10:01 got me!
you need to graduate the high school to understand this epic man never thought anyone could make maths into action packed battle with wepons of cos and sin ..... so glad i subscribed to you so i could watch this .
hermoso se nota los detalles
Mi cabeza aaaa good animation <:
nah but are you not missing an I when you did the exponential expansion of e^ipi
This is the best Math Gun😂❤
Awesome
Yo those sfx and music are so amazing
Muy buen video. Una ingeniosa forma de acercarnos a las matemáticas. Me atrapó!!!
cant wait for animation vs. language arts
how can bro make a letter look happy XD
I really learned a lot from this now
从b站过来的
Boring
this is how math should be taught. chaotically.
a=made math more enjoyable, especially hated Euler's number so thanks for maki it the bad guy
We need sequel of this animation 🔥
Next video:animation vs chemistry
Went from oh yeah I know this to hmmmmmmm... But this was lit frfr
JJ
You just inspired me i tried but its hard
Can you make for me a animation vs codm pls i am long fan
That Was Awesome Especially The Infinite Shotgun Part
Good reputation
How did they make math fun? They just be pulling animations out their minds like that!?
I very want part 2
i know nothing lol
"animation vs meth" when?
Be my math teacher please

The best ever
Can't wait to see this in math class

How the hell does this have more views than ep 1 with the chosen one 🥶
Another masterpiece from the one and only Alan Becker
animation vs kof 95
(Request) Animation vs E-mail
this is wonderfull simply   wonderfull the way alan described the sqare root of -1 = i  was just so cool and the battle of eurilers foumula (the e thing) vs TSC(the second comming) was just a mix of hallarios and entertaining to a nerd like me
No lie this was beautiful
א
I dont get half of the jokes, i love it
my brain stopped braining about the math part but its a good animation
favorite part 9:25
Explica mejor que el profe y el profe si habla

Hey Alan, i never asked you for anything so...can you make anothet Pet to your series?(minecraft and stickman) The pet: Night fury(night fury addon) The owner: Blue  Highs: Protect, grabs things for Blue, likes to play,etc. Obs:ILL BE SO HAPPY IF YOU DO THIS, AT LEAST FOR ONE EPISODE
I earned my degree in math earlier this year. This video did a better job at explaining complex mathematics than any written proofs in my real/complex analysis classes. Very well done, and very satisfying to watch!
i did not understand a thing when he passed from divisions, i don´t know if this is accurate or whatever but god damn this guy know´s how to make art
Extremum fucking hard and evil😂
Can we nominate this for an Academy Award?
Я научилась математике, спасибо, Алан 🥀🥀🥀
Best animation in my Life...,,,,💯💯💯
Math Flight
I didn't understand any of it.

2:07 that 1 got a stiffy
you dear sir, made maths look interesting to me.
Absolut freakin masterpiece my guy! Haven't watched such a beautiful video in years maybe. LOVED IT🔥💯❤
:]
Quien es mas fuerte el naranja conlos numeros o el rey o el rojo de los birus oel negro del fuego
uhhh.....????????
i liked how accurate each method was, especially integrating with the function laser lol hope they make a sequel with electromagnetic physics or thermodynamics that would be wild
Oh my goodness, I've been watching your videos for years now and I must admit, this is the most invested I've been, I almost teared up at the beauty and story telling involved, kudos to your lead animator mate, he/she is pretty fantastic 🎉
Respect from all mathematicians ✊
This is both brilliant and inspiring.
How to make math fun just be alan
Alan Becker is the best
Pls make Hoodie designs for all the designs on your T-shirts
Its perfect❤️❤️❤️
no pos yo ando re perdida pero tremenda animacion
please make more
animation vs portugues kkkkkk

Simply incredible
wow
And you can create a movie in which stickmans meet flash characters from spurt,  gunball,  disposabot, super mechs, galaxy siege 2 and madness. 💪😺👍
godd
man that is a whole movie
As a person who will soon be a math major this brings joy to my heart
Calmest day in the life of a stickman

Im glad that I know you since your very first stickman animation video. Thats pure genius work, so proud of you :)
Animation and math always together..
From 1 video i learned more than from school
It is normal that I’m crying while watching this? Man this is beautiful 🥹
DAMN.
Nerd😂
This is all I’m gonna think about in maths now. Also you already know someone’s gonna check if this is all accurate
WTF
the ending was pretty racist ngl if u aks me
Это, просто, ох...нно! Вначале сюжета ещё что-то понимал в этих формулах и принципах математики, а потом мозг резко выключился и созерцал эпичную битву)
The best video I have ever seen ever!!! No words! How amazing, creative, unexpected and wonderful it is!!! Thanks a trillion into infinity 🙏
Amazing!!! I was wondering  how long does it take having skills to create a video like that
Is this Canon? like does he still have the numbers in the other videos?
When dad wants you to be a mathematician but mom wants you to be an animator!
Considering the fact that I am in 11  I hope I'll learn it all someday :)
10:33 bro just create BFG 10000 using math 😂😂😂
If we get animation vs zombies from pant vs zombies will become popular and fun to watch
pro
Name song
So the end of mathematics is illusion？
Çok ama çok iyi anlatım... Bize matematiği böyle anlatsalardı bakış açımız çok değişirdi
How do you get these ideas  It’s mind blowing
Amazing 🔥
ngeri sih ini
when you shoot a video in Russian pj pj pj pj
Star Wars: We have Death Star TSC: Hold my tangent function. 11:04
Well, when it comes to humans we all know one plus one usually gets you three.  Sometimes 4 if there are twins and so on and so forth.  Humans multiply.  So do rabbits.  They sure are good at addition without even doing the math problem.  They just mate and there you go!!
An ordinary stickman learned mathematics in 14 minutes, and I have been teaching and teaching it for several years
Alan Becker I love your videos they are always so interesting and fun to watch! This math fight is the Best fight I have ever seen!
THIS IS SIMPLY AMAZING!
alan becker is smarter than my tiny piece of braincell
Is it just me or did I just master math within minutes 💀
amazing
Thanks Alan, i needed this. Tomorrow is my maths test...
1:40 if u dont know this that e this. It named Euler formula
love it!
such a amazing video
this is what math looks like
Mathsterpiece 💯
An absolutely brilliant masterpiece.
the perfect content
Students can cheat by watching this amazing video 😂
Honestly, I really love the music. Perfectly encapsulates an infinite dark void with nothing but mathematics.
Plis episode 2 animator vs animation 😭 🙏
Very good animation
You are so special
is the tall orange dude actually purple's dad or did purple just get adopted by him
As a math major, I think a pretty common experience between all of us is that it's very difficult to talk to anyone about this sorta stuff. It's genuinely pretty heartwarming seeing the discipline as this awesome world, and then to actually have the world itself be rigorous and sound.
Maybe between stickman and minecraft try to do stickman and Factorio ;)?
Alanbacker, você realmente faz histórias.
Alan how much days you would do the animator vs terminator ep2?
Çooook iyi video be
好喜欢这种知识从脑袋里一闪而过不留任何痕迹的感觉
Everything is born from the singularity, becomes complex and infinite.
It was magical 😮🤯🤯💥💥💥
damn i more or less understood about 30% of the video... once it got into the "i", I was so lost...
How about math implementations via programming codes?!🥰
Didnt know that math could ne sont awesome
e💮
This should have a Netflix adaptation.
Next!  Physics
Невероятно интересно😮 малюсенько ещё анимация, браво
Excellent 👍
This is scariest videos i ever watched😱
Plz. Animation vs Undertale

Alan can you please make pt 2 of wanted
I think it would be great if Red Orange yellow green and blue all watched a few Minecraft Videos And learned how to Fight like a minecraft Pro
Here me out. Imagine this as a game
Amazing!
The way I perceived this amazingly phenomenal mathimation with stick figure was that 'e' (eulers identity) is quintessentially & quite literally alive. In ontological mathematics and in Leibniz Monadology, Eulers identity when adding a -1 you get a Singularity or a Pythagorean Harmonic Monad of pure ♾️ energy & thought.   The part that struck me the most was before stick figure went into another dimension or realm indicating to me that there's a analogy of Fourier Mathematics where things switch back and forth through the Space-Time domain of Matter & the Frequency Domain of Pure Mind as known in Analytical Sound Engineering.  The whole video blew my mind and I'm not a math major nor do I know any math like calculus, trig and such but conceptually and intuitively I understand what all these serve as functions of the mental domain that orchestrates the domain of matter.   Truly amazing video and would really love to see another math animation video ❤
A Masterpiece!
This one is definitely going Viral
Waiting for animation vs chemistry, where TSC  1) fights the hydrogen ion 2) parkours on DNA strands 3) plays C60 football 4) attains godhood through octet?
Please make another bos, like physique or chemistry...
Some of this hurt my brain😂😂
The best animation i've ever seen... 👍👍👍

WHY THIS MASTERPIECE HAS 4.4K DISLIKES?  I DON'T GET IT
Study for 12 years to be smart in math❌                                                                                                                                                                                                          Watch this video in 14 minutes to be smart in math✅😂😂
This is brilliant
hi
1 hour  version please
cool vid i wish i was in a video  -lil bro
Awesome
And this is how i learned math
one of your best.
Math lore:
Id love to see animation vs physics, animation vs chemistry and animation vs Programming!
this was epic. LITTERALLY
Atlanta net worth
pls animation vs steam
математика эпичнее моей жизни
Pls Make Part Two this is incredible
My dad says "i wish i had this when i was a child, math would be so much easier"
нехуя не понятно но очень интересно
p
the scary thing is I know all of these☠
As a Mathematician I wasn't actually that impressed, except maybe 3-5% of the time. A lot of this was incoherent nonsense, or really overhyping very simple things. If you don't agree after one year of University mathematics, then you aren't that good in Math. 😂
If I like math this would be the only reason i like it
The great math war of the 21st century

You should do a video or a short for binding of ısaac game
It looks mysterious because of the unique font of mathematics, and we have no choice but to fall for it. Especially, the simulation representation of cos and sin functions was really cool.
This explained how math works way better than my school and university did
As someone who loves math, this animation blew my mind.
too complicated
the most unexpected and interesting video from alan becker
The way it stopped the infinity by using limit was genius. Apart from that class 1 to graduation bro showed the whole thing in the best way possible.
me while watching the more further i watch the more blank on my mind 💀💀💀
So so cool! I only understand 70% But very cool, so OK～ If my math class can interests like this, I would study very hard~ But reality is freaking boring…
I have an idea what if orange kept the ball and he could teleport with it and teach his friends math!
That e^{i\pi} coming out of nowhere 😂
Omg we want the 2nd part of it really dope 🔥❤️
feel like a zelda game
Alan Becker i know this
I don't understand anything from this video other than an orange stick man fought a living e
That very smart 💀
Play this in your class at highschool and asks everyone which part they understand honestly, Most wouldn't make it halfway through.
Respect
Alan becker can you do a animation vs Skibidi Toilet with cameraman pls 🙏🙏
best animation I've ever seen in my life
You make me love mathematics
It checks out.
Learning math with alan becker
i love your videos I've been watching your videos for five years since I was a kid and I still love your videos
yoooooooooooo that so cool
I like how the more you watch the more complicated it gets
When a math teacher wants to become an editor, but his girlfriend wants him to be a youtuber😂😂😂😂😂 (He also became a math teacher for his family 🙃)
Why is tsc so good at math?
Wow man... it takes in-depth knowledge of math to be able to create this. Hats off to you 👏
얼마나 많은 사람들이 이 영상을 완벽하게 이해했는지 궁금합니다
What’s your other channel name called? And love it so smart I swear they keep getting better and better❤❤❤
Can you make Minecraft Story Mode vs Animation please?
this is the most beautiful animation I ever seen
hey dud, been watching you since the animator vs animation II video which was 16 years ago, you raised me and im suprised with how well you are now at animating, keep it up!
I used to be great at math, but now I'm not. I'm here for the animation. Looks impressive, down to its very last detail.
와 이걸 이렇게 표현한다고..???ㄷㄷㄷㄷㄷ
This is probably one of the best, and most creative video I have _ever_ seen on the internet before. Absolutley stunning. Great job Alan!
POV: My Brain: 💥
Im smart after look thus video
If only math was this interesting 😔
pov: when two programmers join the same minecraft server
Eighth grader's Nightmare
Do Animation vs Music
My brain got overload 🥹
The story would have turned really epic if e^i*Pi  had summoned his stronger cousins: Quaternions
If possible, please make some of these animations ❤
10-5=? 👇👇👇
Hello dear Alan Becker return your toys please.
I see in this stickman video whole  School and higher mathematics
WTF IS. THIS ARE REAL MATH???!!!???
I'm waiting for "Animation vs Programming Languages"
Only Alan Becker can make a video about maths. That's very intersting
Yo Alan I got an amazing idea animation vs anime
This is the best video I ever saw on YouTube. Thank you for this amazing creative work.
Wtffff the use of iota graph and sin cos. Graphs a was lit😮❤
how
This genuinely makes me wanna concentrate in math classes lmao
😂調皮的AI，不過好可愛😋👍
Oh no he's becoming a nerd 😢
What animater tool is used to do this? This is absolutely amazing.
and it all started with the number 1
My brain is not working
The large thing that looks like the letter N is a symbol called "Aleph null" and it is the smallest of the Infinity's.
Fantastic!!!!!
Math crisis brought by imaginary number is insane I have no idea what's going on in this video after 3:39 Girl who would be able to explain this video is wife material.
Did you just uh...teach an entire generation math in 1 video?
2:06 my bro at a sleepover:
Imaginary realm 😂
Me watching this at 3am 😮
Counting is so much fun 😊
Just made math harder
Wow, I like this animation, it is amazing 😍😍😍😍😍
There is mathematics, but what about physics?
Bruv’s tuning into the smarties drawing 0:00 to 3:58 and 5:29 and etc
Haha I just noticed Aleph clomping around at the end
I would be glad if Alan was my math teacher
i never knew math could be a death star
Bro explained divided by zero better than my math teacher.
I am too old so i have to slowdown the playback speed to see the detail. this is a Very beautiful story.
Can you be my math teacher?
that was amazing !!!!!   last time I enjoyed math that much was at the university
And that's how maths were invented
just how much math do you had to study for this!!!
Math is my favorite subject now can you do a Part 2 please please 🙏
I think you false e^iπ = cos(π) - isin(π)  Not cos(π) + isin(π)
1라디안이 r과 같구나..
multiply by one to go back?
Esto se merece un Óscar 😎🤙
LOVE all the math references. Especially with infinity and the integral 9:53
What just happened here
first math video ive wanted a sequel to.
e iπ

I can only say nothing; it was perfect.🤩🤩
Best animation I've seen so far
i'll come back to this video when i finish school so when i watch this again i will get 2x the joy i got watching this now
Animation vs animator  2 ep pls
Legendary.
Jesus is the life guard holding out His hand for you, the only one who knows more about you than anyone, all the mess and shame, loved you the most and calls you.  You are valuable, not the product of nothing. "Atheism is senseless. I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance." - (Isaac Newton, scientist) You see, Jesus did not come to save good religious people but sinners. We already broke God's laws, whether we have lied or sworn, looked with lust, hated, and so on, and like a just judge, God must justly punish criminals in Hell….. but there is good news. Let's say you break a speeding law and the cop says you have to pay a 500$ fine, all of a sudden someone pays it, nothing remains left for you to pay. Likewise, if someone perfect would be willing to take all of your Hell punishment and give you their perfect record you can justly go to Heaven because someone paid your fine. God in His love, despite our hatred toward Him, made a way for sinners to be forgiven without letting crimes go unpunished. God in His love sent His Son, He lived the sinless life we failed to live, and then offered Himself on the cross as a sacrifice for sin. Jesus, who is fully God and man took the wrath of God sinners deserved, then rose from the dead proving He is who He said He was! If someone takes your Hell punishment then you can go to Heaven! Jesus did all the work, no amount of good works can save you. God offers this gift to those who put their trust and faith in Jesus alone! "The evidence for the life, death, and the resurrection of Christ is better authenticated than most of the facts of ancient history." (E. M, Professor of Classics at Auckland University) come to repent (from unbelief to belief) through trusting alone in Him leading to a new transformed life with actual purpose and hope, if you don’t, you will perish in your sins. “…but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” Romans‬ ‭5:8‬. ‬‬
Great job 🤟
My mind during math class:
This is actually one of the best animations I've ever seen. Like, it's just maths, but I wasn't bored at a single second and couldn't wait to see what came next, just like all your videos. Congratulations to your, Alan, your Lead Animation, and the full team behind this. You guys surprise us every time.
🔥🤧
Ingeniously

13:45 a.... alf(א,Hebrew)???
I bet he can't make a zombie apocalypse episode for animation vs Minecraft that would be cool
Nice video 👍💕
TSC dream when he sleep in minecraft house he made
MASTERPIECE
Alan que paso con the chocen one
Cuando pensaba que Alan Becker y su equipo no podian ser mejor literalmente sacan un "stickman vs MATEMÁTICAS" 💀 Nunca en mi vida quise tanto ver a un matematico reccionar a un video xD
Anyone else get typoman vibes??
To be honest, I don't watch a lot of your videos...  But you generally surprised me with this one.  More creativity and good execution than the current film industry.  You've done good.
Funy video 😂
we need a part 2 pls
3:19 Me:what the hell?!
What a piece of art.
If schools taught math with this much visual aid I think I would've understood it perfectly.
Bruh

Sonho mais fraco da Inteligência Artificial 😂
Another title: An entire Mathematics in just an animation lol😅
🔥🔥
Another series is born!!!
Fun
I need...MOREEE ( jk you can take as long as you need to complete the next video keep up the good work 👍)
This got me more confused than the lore of animation vs minecraft
I used the captions to see what happened and it just said “foreign” why foreign of all words??? What does math have to do with foreign? We have to figure this out. I know Alan didn’t personally put in the text btw I ain’t dum,but seriously,peaks my interest
10:01 waaahh -e
TSC is a positive imaginary thing. Both for us and in math.  Because “The Second Coming” has only 1 i. That is a very neat unintentional Easter egg, way to go team.
Animation vs nintendo games?
This is masterpiece bro... ✨ I don't like math, but i like your animation
Richard playing calculator :
If this doesn't make kids interested in maths, nothing will.
Nah this is a straight up movie
how real men learn math
Yes
When a stickfigure knows more math than yourself
Could you make an animation vs electronics video?. Thanks!
does anyone know which site he uses to animate?
Masterpiece.
make a s. tolit vs a.
Math is philosophy...bottom line: as long as you know your value and where you coming from, the possibilities are endless.
Bro learned Math faster tha my childhood
What is bro fighting?
When math teachers say that you’ll have to use math often in your everyday life…
Por favor haz un juego de pelea como tus animaciones

I understood about 3/4 of it
Will you make another 2 part about animation against math
ricardo walterson jugando calculado en modo facil:
As a young guy watching this, I’m scared on what I’m gonna learn
This is proof that Alan Becker is smart. Very smart. (and TSC)
Wow
This video gave me a different perspective as what the main purpose of Functions is.
Orange has 200000 iq he solves those insane problems
Allen you need to make episode  2 of Animation vs Animator part 6 please please animator vs. Animation part 6 episode one was awesome but need to do episode 2
This almost makes me want to learn!
Теперь чтобы окончательно восхититься данной анимацией, я должен понять математику, а главное почему стикмен дерётся с математической буквой e и буквой i
we need animation vs music now!! thatd be epic also
this is the only math video I accept in life
Las mates son malvadas!
一个动画 NO 一节有趣的数学课 Yes

This is genius. This has to be played in each math class at the start of each year, asking everyone what they understood, and then working on the parts they didn't.
Hola
Hola
Idea: Maybe when the next episode of Animator vs Animation VI can introduce some of the characters from Alan’s older videos. Lik the blue and cyan stockmen from that one CCAD video, or the burger box
We need part 2 please !!!
Can someone please tell me what just happened to orange
math is generally out of mind but, your animation is really cool. i like it the way you are showing us math.
OSTIAAA :00
sos un capo man!!! llegó hasta argentina. Good Luck!
😮😮😮😮😮wow😮😮😮😮
This channel became an educational channel
I like your funny words magic man/ref
i will now make the infinity gun with cardboard

im 9 so i dont understand 3 qrts of it
how creative
Now do it with Tau instead of Pi. PS prodigious animation.
Alan pls I need fnaf im this animation
THIS IS AMAZING
damn satisfying
Creativity on its peak.
This is so cool
Make animation vs lego ninjago please 😀
11:03  this is SPARDA
What a masterpiece pure creativity 🤯
POV: what goes on inside the smart kids head
ow
Even a stick figure can be smarter then Einstein.... THEN WHY DO I HAVE TO SPEND 10  YEARS AT SCHOOL AND I STILL DONT UNDERSTAND ALGEBRA
xd
Confusingly beautiful  That's ridiculous, YouTube made me know of explanation videos first, even though I had no idea about the original animation, so I got terrified, that it could be complicated Well, it wasn't At first But then irrational stuff started to happen... And I just lost it :D Woosh, woosh, pew-pew, tickatickatick, KABOOM, crack-crack-crack, zoop Yeah, it was still awesome  Being fully black n white turned out surprisingly well too
A masterpiece that transcends animation, a breathtaking cinematic feat, a mathematical marvel and an unparalleled masterpiece of physics. Every scene is a visual symphony, every sound is meticulously orchestrated, and everything merges into overwhelming perfection.🤩
animation vs chemistry next
My brain is burning
Update this and make the grid just a giant stick figure grid that the squares out of the end to form the stick figure

All of this is oranges dreams because he is trapped in a cage
MUSIC?😮
Sound design was incredible
This is so cool! This is one of the best videos I’ve ever seen!🎉🎉😂😂❤
As a complex analysis amateur, I love this video. I keep watching it over and over. Amazing math representation.
I am still here in floating in the void
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!! LOVEDDD ITTTT DUDE!!
Bro yhis sounds so great bro
8:15 he unlocked lux R
masterpiece!!!....🤩❤
God
i was feeling so fascinated at each nd every sec of the video. these 15 min were just so magical!!!....; just like math❤💯🤩
This video broke my brain
Tu contenido es increíble y muy detallado me pregunto todo lo que tudo que editar y sumar todo eso
All of math in 14 minutes....
I wish learning maths is as cool as this
That is crazy
I bet it would be even better if i knew math lmao
why'd this teach me more math in 14 minutes than and my math teachers in a year
The numbers Mason, what do they mean?
Wonderfull ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉
Teachers: see I told you, you'd use it later in life
Another masterpiece

Абалдеть! Этож каким сверх разумам надо быть чтоб это шедевр науки сделать! Теперь я знаю где учиться Математике!  РЕСПЕКТ!
I do not barely understand all the refferences here, but I do understand that this is peak content.
For my CS Nerds out there, just imagine a video like this, but for CS! If Alan/someone capable of doing such an incredible video is reading this comment, please consider making a similar video for CS 🙏🏻
bro created death star using maths
Didn't study Maths after 10th standard but loved ur video Love from India 🇮🇳
I learn so much at school
We need more vedios like that!😢
I know what all of this means anybody else?
amazing animation + amazing idea = Animation vs. Math
I find it really cool to see some of the methods that are the concepts of doing mathematics mentally actually visualized. It really inspires me. Thanks for allowing this video to be released!  (To the animator who authored this lovely display of mathematics: Thank you for the ingenious methods of doing the maths, it has expanded my mentality on the methods of the doings within the matrix side of mathematics. The modifications on the numbers is beautifully done as well, it's basically one of the methods that helps with mental mathematics.)  ~MM
Estuvo super genial, una de las mejores animaciones
bro summation notation is so overpowered
this is exactly what math class feels like
Vine a ver por qué este video tiene tantas visitas y me quedé mirándolo hasta el final. Es muy muy bueno; la música, los efectos todo perfecto. Maravilloso!!!
He should try a  Animation vs. Geometry
Bro is discovering every aspect, knowledge of maths in the world 😮
5:34 Perfect freehand circle
Even though I hate maths, I guess from now on I'll love maths, Even though it was complicated and above my league😂😂 I literally don't know anything about the e pie r or anything but........ Bro I have to agree this animation was one of ur best animation The music was awesome Can u pls send me the link where u got this song?? Keep up the op work man  V all love u❤❤ Give a like in these guys.... 👇
greatest of all time
create wanted ep 2
This is the best movie 🍿🎥 ever 😊😊😊😊😊😊
for sure, This is the coooooolest animation I've ever seen
数学の授業がこれならいいのに
The + End = T+h+e + E+n+d
whoever made this all of u did a fantastic job
Oml I barley know division and animation is smarter than me how
I feel like this should be the intro video for all math courses within high school on wards. Plus some of the visuals actually made some things make sense to my (very) not math orientated brain.
아쉽게 e는 안배웠는지라...이해가 안되네
That scream was soo good at 10:01
Insanely beautiful
As an Asian, this remind me of my childhood
Math lore:
man the amount of comments praising Alan despite him not being credited for this animation... not that Alan isn't incredibly talented, but the guy responsible for /this/ masterpiece is *Terkoiz*!
animation vs physics?
when an  engineer becomes animator:
I want another one pleasssee it was incredible to watch damn i want more
Bueatiful
yo soy el que comenta en español creo, desde peru felicitaciones por el trabajo se ve espectacular el video
Seriously, we watched it in maths a few days ago
تيترصعه العصاري ياسر !
Audio, SFX and music is so DAMN GOOD!! What the hell??

I can’t tell if he liked the universe or not.
This thing is just too deep and having a whole story cooked up from Mathematics of all things , is simply mind blowing.
bro math equals monster 9:56
Brilliant video bro .......make pt.2❤❤❤❤❤❤
what a masterpiece
看着看着就看不懂了🤯
This is truly the most beautiful mathematics I have ever seen! A masterpiece!
auuuu auuuuuaauuuuuu
That's really amazing! Best math movie ever! Need a full-length version.
Wow, very good
Wow, That's amazing, I love maths and when I looked this i said "wow"
This made me develop love for Math and those who understand it
Alan Becker and hsi team deserve an Oscar.
This whole thing was just finding Euler's identity?
A video that actually makes math look fun
Bikin otak sengklek
This is like a free online math lesson very good 😮😮😮
This is so satisfying 😊  Who's here in 2024? 👇
Alan make a among us video🙏
seni seviyorum alan
I wonder which one is better Alan Becker or Mark Haynes (creator of the SMBZ series if you are wondering)
Это видео создаёт интерес к математике)
Math is bor... Wait no MATH IS COOL
13년의 여정을 14:2로 단축시켜 버리네 ㅋㅋㅋ
AI wouldnt get it
Hi mr alan.. my son keeps telling me about you. He wants to see u and buy some of ur merch.. he is 6years old and he likes all of your videos. 💕
That's fantastic ❤
10:02 ریلژژلاژژل یاذژذژ
School in math be like
that math make sence but not
x! = Factorial Factorial is only defined for non-negative real numbers
brain hurt
e really can make a big equation boss
System that is kinda like Windows 2000: ReactOS
This is one of the most beautifully crafted animations I have ever seen.
Why was "e" so hostile? Is it a math thing?
Bro made this on my bday
❤😂😊
So now we finally know the equation probabilitor used for his math ray
Man, you'll never die!❤️🔥
This is crazy omg
Матеша-это сила.
This was AMAZING!
@ahmadalmasri96
ok now I want someone to do this: what if someone code the stickmins (im not mother language idk how to say it) with ai and let them play in our computers it would be super cool
Please, may I know what program you are using to implement this project
Can we get more of this episodes
pov: the second coming finished its mathematic course from kindergarten to high school in 14 minutes
great video, dont know enough math to understand it all, but it was beautiful nontheless
it felt like watching whole documentary about math, nice job!
That may have been one of the only times I was interested in math! Nicely done!
Notice when the orange stickman attack him with infinity set, he block it with integral because integral can handle infinity. But then, the stickman attack him with some kind of cosπ+isinπ (?), which makes his integral shield destroyed because integrals can't handle multivariables I guess.
1+1 potty
This would be so much more fun if I understood math D:
I'm sad that I have C- on math.
Now my brain isn't braining anymore
Incredible !! 😃😃😃
*What goes through my mind in math tests* :
До е в степени iπ было все понятно и интригующе, потом пошла жестокая война, ничего не понятно, но очень завораживающе, это очень умный математик сделал!!!
The youtuber i think would get 100% from math:
Sheeeeesh
Matematik dersinden sonra ben :
“Only guy can make math fun”
I would be damn afraid if I was chased by Euler's Formula too
e symbol guy is the teacher trying to teach you maths 😂
Melhor video de matemática que ja vi em toda a minha vida.
I know I am in no authority to tell you what to do, Mr Becker, but please do Animation vs Science someday!
The climax had be tears...
That's awesome ❤
your animations is like a movie!
Teachers use white rose, they should use Alan Becker instead
So fun to watch
Wow
The best....
genius🔥
?????? 멋진 액션인건 알겠다.
Better than latest Marvel movie.
👍👍👍👍
Its amazing
From the most beautiful things I've seen in 2023
Une dingueri
So much attention to detail
This is a masterpiece and will go down in hist6
Math teachers gonna be showing this to their class stopping every 10 seconds to explain
Did we just learn Math lol
Не думал что алгебра, математика будет такой интересной._.
Amazing design specially θ for the round expression!
WOW that was so good keep up the great work
SO ACTIONPACKED AND EDUCATIONAL AT THE SAME TIME!
A young wizard discovers magic and uses it to battle the many faced god
He should make a video game on it
Can you do the rest of the videos of  animations vs YouTube part2 pls
we want part 2
this is cinema
数学苦手だから頭痛い😢
U should make more on this bro
the fight scene  DAWM
Muscle spec nuggets American soldiers like a sketches of pictures of Pacific iPhone could come see us from 🇮🇱
bro the sound effects
i hate alan becker i likk bdfi
i dont know now who is more powerful this one or the second coming
My 9-year old son asked me about e(iPi) a few days ago. As I didn’t know how to explain that to him, he recommended this video to me, asking me to learn it first and teach him then. He likes this video a lot. In the past few days, I saw he was watching it again and again. Although he doesn’t understand most of the things described, he thinks it is cool and maths is cool. This is already a great success of it. Thanks a lot to the author❤ BTW, at least I explained him what is i and he got it 😊
This gave me goosebumps
Bro this is fucking crazy…
Kids can learn more things from this masterpiece than for 20 years in school
🤔😯🙁😠ghgyvis gym. ...
Thanks
Alan Becker is Smarter than 99% of all Harvard Studants
That animation movie showed pain of students to understand that "e" 💀
Wow
Now maths is my favourite subject
This should be shown in all schools
математики, бойтесь вызвать математического монстра)))
Ohh my god
coming here from "all the maths references in animator vs maths" by ...
This is how our math is,its easy but then it gets harder harder and harder until one point you dont understand
12:42 clippy
oh my lord, this is so so so well done
Masterclass
bro thinks hes albert ainsains💀
8:31 i lost it here
This is insanely awesome and inspiring for a Math enthu like me.
If only they taught math like this in my school, I would have been a math professor by now...
Safe to say alan becker passed math🔥🔥
Awesome !!
nice
It could have been a way for loving maths !?? 🤷🏾‍♂️
speechless
1. You can't Square root Negative number.
Nicee❤❤
Sound design. Animation. Math Concepts. The power of shapeshifting e^i pi possesses. A pretty neat demonstration of why division with 0 doesn't make sense. sin cos graph animations. This has to be probably one of the best math animation videos ever.
The sound design in this is so satisfying, I really like all the mechanical clicks and other sounds used in this
수학 빨리 포기하길 정말 잘한 거 같군요
Math is fantastic and you made it more fantastic.... Awesome animation bro and it didnt break any mathematical rules 😮😮😮
this video is awesome
where the part 2
Its my second favourite animation by you
Incradible.........😱😱😱😱😱
Wow....
When you put delta at the end it was so genius
이거 결말 어케된건지 아는사람..?
Alan was really smart then alien brains
I think this guys never learned math before
The visualization of what certain actions actually mean (such as the matrices popping up with the use of powers) was so well done!
Math is unfavourite subject now days
This was brilliantly made! Great job!
It was kida hard for me to understand . But I was in awe . It's beautiful and a reminder that I used to like maths .
Is this being shown in cinemas?
👑👑👑👑
Animation vs. Undertale...Change my mind!
the only math video that i in joy lol
When an mathematian and animator collab together
I don't really understand but this is so fun
Vẻ đẹp của toán học
@_@  ??????
Funny how it all started with 1+1
orange is genius
개지린다
Thanks to Alan becker's animation team and terkoiz for showing math, visually.
Как будто небольшой боевик посмотрел….😊
its just so good I don't even know what to say 10/10
My brain can’t keep up with the numbers
This would definitely be included in 2023 YouTube Rewind if ever there will be.
I think why alan becker videos aren't on youtoube kids
Mind-blowing
1+1=s ex
When is episode 2 of AvA V coming out. Or at least Animation vs Math 2 would be better

This will go down in history!
9:30 INFINITY BLAST
I only know basic math, but I really enjoyed this.
Hermoso
good video
앨런!!!!!!!!!드디어 한국인들 한테 알려지는 구나!!!!!
cara sao 03;23 da manha e to vendo isso
Can u make a video on Bio vs Math whith your amazing visual 😅
The "físico gamer" explain this, but in spanish, if somebody want understand... In spanish
Great animation brother , I wish that some some I will become an animator like u ...
After this video i really interested in math again
Epico
Everything make sense 😮
А ведь все началось с цифры 1...
What the hack 😮 Why this video got that much views
Now just you wait for animation vs astronomy
animated stick legend
It is fucking awesome
As an engineering student who went through many math courses, this gotta be an amazing animation… If only you showed matrices…
This was the most beautiful display of mathematics I've ever seen!! Everything was spectacular! Animation, sfx, the actual math, I had the craziest grin on my face the entire time!
¡Fascinante!
I know I hate math but this one is so cool
19 + 1? 21?
Wow 👏👍👌
After this video I am liking math a little bit 😅😅
imagination world of an introvert asian kid...
Alan; I have an animation idea for you. Animation Vs. Pikmin. It would be really fun and it could be like red going thru the game and versing purple or the king orange or purple in a Dondori battle or something to commemorate pikmin 4’s release
you should try a animation vs friday night funkin. i know theres already a mod about it but i would love to see it from the creator himself
Nerd lv M A X.
I hate that I am not smart enough to understand and remember it but know enough to remember that this was covered in maths class and I was too lost in the maze of explanation lol (specifically Euler's formula)
O_O THE SOUND DESIGN AND THE VISUAL INTERPRETATION OF MATHS IN THIS VIDEO IS SOOOO GOOD O_O JAW DROPPING O_O_O_O
Okay i love math
this guy just taught the maths till 12 clASS IN 12 MIN
bro understood math faster than my brain can process fractions
beautiful
You mean -e^iπ = -cos(π)-isin(π) at 4:16
ebaumsworld
at the start i was actually screaming at the e  I was so unnecessarily pissed over a letter
Math is beautiful
If maths has an anime
Nah this is a whole star Wars movie
impresionate, si te gusta, claro :)
I’d imagine teachers in high school and college would play this video
This is incredible !
I would like to have a video about animation vs science
I wonder how rule 34 will work now
Thanks for the video, Alan! I can learn math easier now!
I want to learn from you...
high school be like:
make a game out of this
This is so beautiful! 🥺
The sound design is just brilliant. It really creates that immersive feeling that all that story of Orange Stick Man and e Constant happens for real. And, of course, the guy who came up with the idea is just genious.
The limit holding on the infinity shot tho 🔥
this is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen from you alan. thank you for this. also hold on scroll down                                     the second coming: I AM GETTING ANSWERS e:ok *1 hour later* the second coming: hey e e:yea? the second coming: can you get me back home? e: sure *back at home* yo mom i got all A’s
Problemas matematicos↑ 😂 entendés?
Alan haz una animación con el stickman de jzboy
wtf
I love this vid and the background music
man fr i have not seen you in years
Can you make animations in Terraria pls
beautiful
good🤠
is so cool dude
love this
VN say: Vẻ đẹp môn toán (Đại số)
Me encantó que el principal personaje "no-humano" sea la gran ecuación con PI, i y e, bellísima ecuación!
This is amazing
I didn't understand the end, why did he leave? someone explain me
This taught me about math better then my teachers
Animation
Now do fornite vs animacion💀
어째 익숙한 느낌이 든다 했더니 애니메이터vs애니메이션 시리즈 만든 사람이었네 엄청 감명깊게 봤었는데 ㅋㅋ
13:49  Aleph?
man do video game of this animation name is the animation VS math
holy  maths
AMAZING!!!!!
This is just beautiful 🥹
this is entertaining, please make more of these but instead make a science version
А вы за 12 лет это учите
Bro this is like the best video in the world❤
Thật hay rất đáng để coi đó
Gotta show this to my math teacher
Not only was this instructive, but done with a chunk of whimsy, barrel of alacrity, bucket of wisdom & a silo of sparkle.  I started doing algebra again after 50-years.  I wanted to show-up my middle school teacher who told me, “You’ll never get it.  You don’t understand what “X” is”… the variable, the master key to the puzzle – don’t want to be puzzled any (ANY) more about the magical algebra.  I probably started (at 50+) again to show him up (Commander Schard, really!); but… thankfully I ended-up love it today!  Deep in my mind & heart, always finding some appreciation for the precision of existence.  Thanls Al.
when subtitle
Wait how about animation vs geometry dash
이거 진짜 개지림 퀄도 높고 개재밌음
This video took my confusion with math to the next level
마지막에 오일러공식같은것도 다 나옴
Ae Alan tao fazendo vidio de red x orange cara fais augu se não vai piora
@alanbecker are you xkcd by any chance?
am i like the only person who understands everything and i am only 10 years old as of watching it and it all makes sense?
Math's the coolest subject if you think about it.
Esto es simplemente espectacular e increíble en todos los aspectos
Increiblemente espectacular.
Hello, I am Korean. Your video is known as 'a video that makes math fun to watch' in Korea Your video is dynamic and cool. I'm hoping for this quality next time, but it's going to be hard But as your viewer, I think it's time for me to subscribe and read
Wow
part 2 when?
Okay bro just made math fun they should show this I’m schools could do a better job than teachers because kids would enjoy this stuff
Dam that was cool
all of my friends in school likes u draws ur animations.
That was awesome!!!!!
10:02 _Waaah!_
лучший ролик за все время этого канала
Youtube wont let me reply to their comment.
3:58 3:58
Make more Minecraft vs animation please 🥺
Ya lo vi seis veces
Oh w0w I could watch you all day messing with algibra
Теперь я вспомнил почему полюбил математику в школе..... Похоже настал время вернуться. /  . Now I remember why I fell in love with math at school..... Looks like it's time to come back.
8:49 Why is the circle increasing in size? I saw a couple "e"s grab the "theta" symbol and "r", but why would they help him? Couple of traitors?
Did you know: the thing in the background( 13:46 ) is the smallest infinity
I don’t like math
Es increible este video T...T
The power of math
this is the masterpiece. your animator deserve oscar  of to animation
This is a masterpiece, the creator is indeed a true genius.
do science vs animation
Absolutely amazing
YouTube commented!?
This has to be the nerdiest action movie ever to be created by humanity ever🤣🤣. And it's a masterpiece 👌🏼👌🏼🔥🔥🔥
i show this to my kids
study math : 🚫 study by this video: ✅
As greek guy I love math🤓🤓🤓🤓
pov:maths the game
Wow this is amazing!!
Bro really make death star whit math 💀💀💀
the most beautiful thing i have ever seen
Alan u just did an masterpiece right there! THIS IS SO DOPE! But what happend afterwards? and how did he end up there???? 😳😳❤❤🙏🏽🙏🏽
wonderful
THAT WAS AMAIZING!  ZETA THE TRUE LOVE ❤❤❤❤
Siiiiii
Please upload a new video quickly🤩🤩🤩
I want to see after “animation vs geometry”
Make more
Me türkiye olarak bura bir yorum bıraktım .
I believe it's the best useful video I've ever seen on YouTube so far. Thank you so much for making this. You just made math easy to me to understand.
this is amazing
I think you should do animation vs desktop goose
I learnt more math from this than my entire 6 years in school😂
seriusly the best part is the part when appaear i number (imaginary number) and i like Euler number (e) and pi
Good job. Now make Animation vs Meth, where the stickmen try to stop drug dealers from doing their job.
After 4 minutes I have no idea what these equations are
Lo entendí todo
Only math students knows what was happening in video
Bro, imagine second coming trying to explain this to others stickman.
That white hole gives me AvM 30 vibes...
If you know how you use it anyone cant beat you
I love how true the mathematics are! AWESOME animations :D
I missed you
I solved all this equations, and all the answers are wrong
i knew about 20% of the math that was happening, though i am only in grade 8
IQ👍
Best Video I have ever seen😍😍😍
wtf i love math now
The new way to enjoy math..

My grandma said it’s not math🤨 but I feel like your right
@nihongomantappu
Bro learned duping when
You turned math into masterpeiace
bro craftin like its Minecraft
You want animation students to be excited for math? This.
Math is awesome
ay we mi mente
Please upload a new video quickly 😊😊😊
A criatividade é mais de 8,000 👏
The second coming knows math better  then me
Hi
I only laughed once, when a minus sign inverted the character... I feel so far away from those mathematics.
You do so much math that my mind will explode🤯🤯🤯
This is the fist uncountable ordinal , that is the first true infinity. 13:47
im no math genius. im not even in high school yet. but i know at the end that huge N is aleph null
The asmr🤯😫
You need to make more videos
An animation masterpiece ✅ A cinematic masterpiece ✅ A mathematical masterpiece ✅ A physics masterpiece ✅ Cinematography ✅ Sound design ✅ Everything is so perfect
This is what happens in our calculators
Can some one explain me the ending ???
My brain blow up
No wonder it took quite long
I sent this to my maths teacher and he's now my fan
The action was so frickin Cool we need a movie with this concept
Even though I gave up on math, I became interested in math thanks to this video.
You can make an application for PC where we can communicate with stickmans, like you did in Animator vs. Animation V
you should absolutely do one for chemistry 🧪 ⚛️
Math is a good subject! I used to answer math now.
My sibling and I are arguing which number is greater:
Upload Animation vs. Physics
Alan never disappoints
Please make it mobile game
I love math❤
Just WOW + AMAZİNG
Какая же математика страшная вещь....
how do you even come up with something like this??
ℵ ζ δ Φ
The most confusing thing I will ever watch 😢
sticman = maths
Man, does anyone remember orange finding  the other 4 stickmen while they were fighting, animator vs animation, minecraft vs animation or youtube vs animation? Time passes fast man.  Edit: I just relised that all that time I watched your videos, I have never subscribed to you.
ℵ
My favorite sound is 10:02 🥰
Thank you for existing.
The beauty of math revealed.....
Marvelous, this made my day !
Bro... It should be paid 😮
Best crossover ever ( 10:35 imagine with the infinite sign it would be godly)
全てを理解できない自分が悔しい
Учимся математике 😂😂😂
Me and my math teacher be like:
😫😫😫
Wow
This is the most impressive animation ive ever seen well done!!!
א
Amazing!
Omfg bro, what was thiss videoo!!! Mind blowing, Huge nostalgia when  we used to mess around with  mathematics in Engineering. Even though hated them I still miss playing with equations, Well done alann❤Masterpiece
Just amazing, all these equations in a single video and viz, just masterpiece.
Alan needs to make a new chosen one with a very thin stick figure
*Satisfying*
Alternative title: if mathematics was a boss fight.
Slowly starting to think he is running out of ideas.
Goosebumps are coming while watching this
*As someone who loves math and your animations I think I can proudly say this is most definitely one of my favourite animations from you. Keep up the great work man.* *😊*
まさか制作者様が数学まで学者並の頭脳までお持ちとは…感激∞
EASY.
Lol
Does: Animation vs. Terraria, please
this was the best animation in a while i want moar
Animación vs jojo’s?
Bro can start a new season with this one bruh
This episode is great and all but I bet we’re all thinking the same thing…. How did orange end up here?
Multiply it by zero
É só eu ou quase n entendi nada
The orange guy could be a super hero and would defeat every other guy
🫨
I ❤ math thanks
couldn't be more ready for my math exam resit
So this is what goes on in the mind of mathematicians
i'm pretty sure not even 1% cause i barly understand any of it
I love this animation. The music freaks me out.
me pueden alludrar con una pregunta ¿Por que las operacioenes que son utilizadas como arma el resultado de ser utilizadas es cero "  0 "?
Someone has finally visualized how math looks and feels in my head, and then threw a stick figure into it, it's genuinely inspiring
Kamal Yar❤
Where's minecraft

can you do physique next?
uno de los videos màs hermosos que existen, y violentos
Hey looks like Alan Becker influenced YouTube to do his maths good work kiddo... Well not kiddo but just acting punny y'know
The backside of my notebook in math class be like:
animation vs Roblox pls🙏🙏🙏
Alan Por qué Ya dejaste de subir videos😢
two words: Doodle God.  look it up.
Lịch sử ra đời của toán học, bao nhiêu thế kỉ, công trình nghiên cứu 😬

I like math after to watch this video
This is so perfect that it made me emotional
Very exciting bro 🔥
2 x 2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3 quick maths🔥
No my teacher doesn't know so much about math

Bro even beat math with math
My maths teacher sind this to me 😂😂
Truly a masterpiece
What teachers expect us to do:             Me: 1 + 1 = fish right?
What is music?
That was interesting
How did he end up in there
this is awesome
Your so good at animating that you can make an epic video out of math! Your amazing!
1+1=24👍
I don't know these things:  e^(i * pi) = -1 Radius can be calculated with theta.
1+1 2 1+1+1+1+1+
Caaaarl
Math is not just about numbers, equations and algebra expressions, it is about the infinite possibilities, creativity as well as the feelings that each respective math character has (like Euler's number and so on).
So cute
Make your next  video that Green becomes evil and strong cause all the other stick figures were evil and strong it would be pretty cool
do you know hebruw
How did you make this animation
Oh my word this is too perfect
Well The Number's are about infinity in 1 like millions if numbers has it like 0.1 0 ℵ0 and lot of more???????????????'' Math is Endless''
eiπ always is : pu pu pu pu pu pu pu pu pu pu
The sad end😢
i love it
Đỉnh
Pls do animation vs chemistry
Alan Knows such complex math
Honestly I think Aleph is too small knowing it’s the smallest cardinal infinity, which should actually be quite big?
After this, dont ask why maths are not boring.
непонятно
13:45 א
An absolute masterpiece! The animation and sound design are just perfect!
this is the my first time i have ever seen such animation  on maths it was amazing ,i respect  to your creativity with hard work
This is the best animation I've ever seen.
Real talent ❤
YouTube is such an sigma
Mathgasm !
Wow
If the for the people who don’t know at the end the giant thing walking is actually infinity but the one of the smallest infinity
This is the best video about math I've ever seen
that's so amazing
Imagine a math teacher uses this to teach about math
수학을 애니메이션으로 만들어내는 모습이 정말 멋있습니다. 경이로움에 할 말을 잃었어요..
And this is how maths ate the man...
If only my teachers taught me maths like this..
That was fun to watch, not quite sure what 'Γ' at the end is but I understood the rest of it.
just spectacular...
Bang buatin stickman vs anggry bird

if alan becker turk, will be 1st on yks
10:33 gave chills 🥶🥶
Please make second part
The most coolest and complicated video i have ever seen
Someone should make video explaining what all is going on over here!!
lo máximo!!!!
Let him cook, who know we can have history

Aleph is so big 😮
This is a true masterpiece
I like it but it's confusing
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah, just like in school, start off 1+1 and just 4 minutes later you see =f(.)
Alan is a great guy who can learn and have fun!
Although I am weak in Math , I still appreciate the story, action, animation and sound design .  Very well done guys 👏
Years an years go but your still here ❤❤
the cool!
То чувство когда только в 7 классе
I would have dropped out of university if this existed then 😢
I Love It Pls Make More
Only if i can do those things with math it will be my fav subject again
Absolutely outstanding, as always.
Incredible !
When you ask your math teacher if it will help you in life  Also The math teacher:
That's me on the math exam
Good video
це реально круто
man nailed it
Now at least we need one with physics and other with chemistry! ❤
Best ever animation ever and the greatest channel ever. Alan keep the good work with these cool animations up and have a nice day.
Mind blowing
So cool mate!!
This is amazing! Thank you for this fantastic animation!
Do the dark lord vs monster school lol
The 'e' save him in the last
You deserve millions of likes and subscribers ❤
wow
Now I regret taking biology as subject in higher secondary school 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢! I should have taken math ➗➖➗➖➗➗ 😂❤
You a Master Dude, Gratz !
😊
The stick figure is better than me at math
Who would have thought this ah 😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
What a great thing to watch. Absolutely stunning work. Congratulations. ❤️‍🔥👏🏻
Its so amazing how someone could even come up with something like this and it absolute abomination like amazing
Euler’s equation is indeed famous: e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0  🎉
Yo that was fucking amazing
I think what he’s trying to convey is that math with letters is evil
genial!! Agora quero ver sobre musica! seria ainda mais louco, um sofonica de Beethoven outro nivel!
The ultimate question: why tf does SC or Orange have a fricken hole in his face?
Amazing! A true masterpiece!
This is make me more scared to math😂
Beautiful astonishing imagine how long it took respect and admire dude :D
THE REAL FREE FIRE
This animation should be shown in all countries of the world in schools
Amazing Vedio bro 🤯
Bros a MAGA mined
El detalle de la serie de Taylor es increíble
Amazing!!
O infinito...
I want this but as a video game
It was like Tony stark (orange stickman) discovering the new element (maths).
Sin palabrass
This is perfect and modernize way to learn basic mathematics. It's fit to our kids and this is the fun way to teach them about basic mathematics
This video is an absolute masterpiece, that's all what I can say.
Alan back at it again making YET AGAIN THE COOLEST PIECE OF ANIMATION EVER!! Because of you I went to art school to learn how to be an animator. Thank you!!!!! ;D
Amazing animation! I’m a bit sad that we didn’t get to see j and k, the quaternions. i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1. Additionally, ij = k and ji = -k. They’re 4D numbers, though their most common application is 3D rotations.
Just brilliant man
I want more video on math concept please in animation
Top video, very beautiful and epic. Before that, I thought that mathematics was just a subject, but after that the situation changed. Of course, I would like what you would do in other subjects like chemistry or geography, and yes hello from Russia
🤓☝️
내가 이분 영상을 중학교때 처음봤었고 지금까지 보는중…. 진짜 대단한 사람
Is math you favorite subject now
The best film l ever seen.
me quiero morir alan
I AM A MATH MAJOR AND THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL. IT CAN BE A GAME IN THE FUTURE.
That was so chaotic… but fun to watch… poor e got tormented by that stick figure lol
为什么用欧拉公式作为第二个主角，因为它是目前数学最完美最简洁最伟大的公式，它包含了虚数、三角函数、虚数、圆周率π、自然对数的底数e、指数等各数学分支，充分体现了数学之美，说它是艺术也不为过。  Why choose Euler's formula as the second protagonist? Because it is currently considered the most perfect, concise, and magnificent formula in mathematics. It encompasses complex numbers, trigonometric functions, imaginary numbers, the mathematical constant π, the natural logarithmic base e, exponentiation, and other branches of mathematics. It fully embodies the beauty of mathematics and can even be aptly described as art.
Part 2???

Orange had the death star 😭😤😤
This vidio make me smart🤓🤓🤓🤓
part 2?
1.- Why did you make the short? Why? To make fun of those who don't know math? 2.- And yet, good job. I felt very insulted and humiliated and yet the story is interesting. Mathematicians (and of course your lead animator who I don't know why you did hire to make this short whose reason to exist is very unknown to me) will understand that sh*t you did. However, the concept is interesting. If you did all that on your own, good job.
Season 4 pls , Season 4 pls ,season 4 pls, please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please pl
this is what goes through my brain during a math exam

I’m not smart enough to understand what’s going on in this video. But Alan being Alan, I suppose every single answer is right
10:00 Best Scene EVER! In anything ever! Anime???? Potential??
Alan Becker fazendo uma simples conta numérica
Me in a math exam
I propose animation vs physics and animation vs astronomy and by the way i love your videos and your animation
Bro made mathematics everyone's favorite subject❤❤
me who got and A+ in math after watching this video:
hi
i know make this is very tired but pls, pls save the youtube by your vid like this pls, ur my hero man.....
You should make animation vs Roblox
awesomeness increases with every episode, waiting for chemistry and physics
😂
best depiction of math ever
Okay. I subscribed
This was just insane. I understood most of this from my time in college level maths but man, what a video.
part 2
This is how every math teacher should start the school year. Play this video and see the awe on all the students faces. That’ll get them to actually want to learn mathematics!
My brain at math lesson:
0:17 5:58
alan is the true chosen one
I like how you put the alphanull sign in the end it fits perfectly
This was so amazing and even better because there was no derivatives to solve.
Awesome
The great math war
hello youtube
The attempt to divide by 0 was actually the best visual explanation for why you can't divide by 0 that I've seen.
I knew 67%
Am i the only one who don't understand the point of the video and only loves the animation? HAHAHAHA
Masterpiece❤
This should be how they teach math
Why the letter א is in there?
dayum, the soundtrack is AWESOME!! is there any way to listen to it without sfx?
Thought he was gon eat the pie
11 easy
I think the music is the map music for GTA 5?
Epic
Choose a toothpaste brand  • Sensodyne • Colgate • Close up  Tysm!!
now we need this with the other 4 stickfigures, just 5 stickfigures messing around with the physics of math.
Hello I have a quite of an idea but it will take age's. What if I code a game for this animation it'll be very mathematical but not as hard as Graphwar.Of course someone could already have done that while I am still working out how cause it will  take age's I mean years actually because I am alone in creating this program.Also I have developed an interest to the subject Mathematics.
This is how to learn math in a quick and fun way
Absolutely brutal. Awesome piece of art and knowledge!
太帥了
이거만 하루에세번본다
Who new you could learn math, be entertained, and have fun all at the same time!
Pllllllllsssss amimator VS amimation 2 plsssss
the -v/___on the 4 means n (number)⋏½
Me waiting for the next episode of AvA
Hey sense you made animation vs super Mario bros and made an actual short with Kirby can you a video with sonic mania?
this video really enters into advanced math but the animation is soo smooth! great animations Alan!!
Bro is smarter then me in 14 minutes 💀💀💀
I'm a math lover and I LOVE this math animation you've done to inspire us all! I can't wait to see what's coming in our future math animation! x
Hola. Como estas  yo bien i.  Tu?
Orange destroyed calculated😂😂
The characters are simple but very useful. Good Job
just wish it was less violent :)
You ❤️ Alan becker
Это круто, и красиво!
impeccable sound design, better than most modern professional work, very well done
Where the 2 are reunited to face a much bigger enemy, where it will be very difficult to win, they will even need everyone's help, you know. Like it was the avengers movie with the gems
Part 2, I hope you have
א?
What your budget 1M 10M 100M 1B?
@FajrulFx bahas ini
This is worthy of @3Blue1Brown - He would absolutely love it I am sure. Next evolution - Matrix Mathematics !!!
Make animation vs geography pls 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The next part should be (The Negatives and Positives.) The e is enprisoned in the Negative kingdom and uses his math to bring the stickman back and he can only use Positive math to break out inside the Negative world.
pov: when orange becomes einstein
My head is boiling😢
Wow this animation is just insanely good and very well done.
This is cinema
Looking forward to the next episode.
Amazing!!!
1+1=2😮
I think i know somebody who paid attention in math class 😳
how did he make math so entertaining to watch?
I like how TCF conjured e and just started beefing
Esto es una obra de arte❤
I love this way much more than the TENET movie!

Minecraft education
That escalated quickly for some maths
I love math and cience
Collecting signatures for animation vs kirby.
شدعوه 18 مليون ب12 يوم
you nailed it hard men!!! keep that work going
No matter how hard they try, the animations always find a way to get in a fight with something.
06:56 Jasmine
dude you are amazing. this is beyond comprehensibility of how amazing this truly is.
I thought Maths couldn't be more interesting than it currently is. This guy proved me wrong!!
THE ABSOLUTE CREATIVITY HOLY SHWABALONEY😦
best video of the year
I love this, even though I hate math. I like the music behind all of it
this man has made masterpiece after masterpiece all from a stick figure and i love it!
This is the most effective way you teach math, period.
Hey Alan you will never see this but can you do an animation where they’re stuck in the arctic😅
bro it's richard watterson
Why Alef?
I love how e is evil... before animation man learns how to use it....

Ребят кто из России пж про лайкните комент сколько вас тут?
Please, part 2
Haha love Aleph Null stompin away at the end 😂
Жаль что Алан английский я бы поддержал его но незн инглиш просто знайти то что это понятней чем 11 лет абучения
I know all those who do not like maths were able to watch more than 5 minutes.
:3
I don't understand e and i  I'm not bad in math, but i never learn these ones
Hey alan i have a idea for the last ep on this series victim vs orange blue green yellow the choose one purple king orange and the dark lord a team vs victim you like my idea give me heart
I thought this was a really cool video I've already watched it 2 times you should make more videos like this
Orange Guy is like when you give a 5 year old a calculator for the first time
Quisiera que icieras a la cosa paresida a la e estikman

I'm in pure awe
se vio todo el teorema de pitagoras
I understand so little of what I watched but it was amazing
The fun way to learn math
This is so fkn stupid and pointless.
Muy buen video. Le hice ver a mi sobrina, le gusto. Cuanto tiempo le habra tomado hacer esa animacion, hay mucha matematica.
absolutely the great animating and visual math representation ever hands down effing love it!!!!
Nerd hahaah
droga audio visual
Pls do a part 2 with physics!!!
What a masterpiece 😍😍🔥
That to cool and waht the .... You me favo youtuber

Hah, I think that this video can make a full-fledged game..
Here's why math is dangerous
As a wise man once said,   "The mathematics is probabaly the closest thing we will ever get to wizardry"
Wow
bro made math actually interesting to watch
at some point this stopped being a math video and started being an action movie.
I love your videos they are always so good I’ve been watching for  a very long time and your videos get even better and better
A Cyberchase episode
I'm in year 7 so i didn't know what the hell was going on
So ePIIIIIIIICCC 💀💀💀 I LOVE O_O
Imagine if they taught math like this in school
impressive
I want a part 2
Deixei de entender no 2=6÷4
Math here actually looks like a sci-fi technology :D
Academy Awards
This is amazing I’m pretty much speechless. I consider this one of the best cinematic pieces in the world . The way the mathematics connects to the physics Is amazing. Man I would love to be part of something like that. This belongs in the history books Einstein’s got nothing on you Alan!
That's literally what I call "a meaningful animation"
You should animation vs stick fight the game
anything can be interesting you just have to make it
i better see stick figures in windows 11 after that
animation battle history
beautiful work

Can anyone explain this?? It's a request
Alan u r not helping with fear of maths😂
Why was this made

22.8M Subscribers He Should Have 100M Subscribers For The Animation But The Worst Part Is (The Time)
i just got motivation to do some studying
Throwback to the stick fighter videos of the early-mid 2000s.
Ohhhho my brain is going to blow😮😅
cute
My bro is learning math
Why is this more entertaining than  actually learning math?!?!
I understood until 1:39
you could produce more of these videos for math explanations , it will be so helpful
I feel like someone who doesn't understand this can enjoy it just as much.
it's Orange VS e^i3.14159... edit: maths
I think it was not  -cos(π)+isin(π).   Is    = -cos(π)-isin(π)
Omfg This is just awesome.
数学大好きだー！！！

The music. The sound design. The story. The cinematography. It was all just perfect to watch. Probably my favorite video I’ve ever seen on YouTube in my 7 years of being on here.

Perfect!
Go get a popcorn.  And enjoy the action fight.
Animation discovers autoclicker XD
Gotta love Giga-Chad Aleph at the end. I love that Aleph has no real physical form either. It's so all-encompassing it's just a shimmer in the background, literally unreachable (no amount of addition, multiplication, potentiation or factorialization of finite numbers will ever reach it).  Essentially it is the "stage" upon which all this plays out.
Awesome! Keep up the great work!
Bro can find the x
He is literally me
Brooo, it's amazing
1+1 = 11
u studying smth rn cose it seems like, u want to help other college students :) kinda helping tbh. Q: that f('dot') what is that function?
11:33  That is like crossing a black hole’s event horizon/an evaporating black hole at its final moment when the math breaks. Or, it is showing that Godel’ Incompleteness theorem is the “final singularity” in mathematics because it shows the endless loop of self referential paradox.

God created this guy as a sample for us humanity the reason how Godly and powerful we are, we should be all proud where humanity has come and we shouldn't fight but embrace and help each other, there can only be chaos or harmony, hate or love, and math defines that <3 pure awesome animation art, as a Programmer / Web Developer, this kind of skill is purely on a next level more power to this channel <3
May you live long! ❤
porq vc reprovou em matematica.  a prova:
better animation than adhiprush
cos + sin = π cos + isin = e iπ
Awesome ❤
I understood nothing, i suck at math, but its amazing.
pixar has no right to call itself an animation studio after releasing this masterpiece
Когда 1 анимация решила домашние задания😂😂😂
I what to see more with the other Stickmans in different Subjects😌✌️
THIS IS HOLY FUCKING GREATEFULL MATH!!!
This is my favourite animation
Always takes W's
🤯 Espectacular!
bro went from simple math to an anime fight scene
Yo why is youtube in the comments
Imaginense cuanto tienes que saber para hacer esto/Imagine how much you need to know to do this
this is the modern art not the others
Bro this is the best math class I’ve ever had💀
More character development than a modern Netflix Marvel or Disney movie

that was so calming well done   i loved it :)
I wonder what will happen when his friends find out he’s the Einstein in math out of the group
I think he's gonna start a new series 😂

Bro explained math better in 14 minutes than my teachers in 12 years by just doing... Animation? Schools need to be updated change my mind.
Amazing !!!
This is - in every way - the best thing I have seen on the internet in a very very long time
Wouldnt be alan becker without a giant reality erasing laser

The only thing I want to know is,why orange is there?
Man!!! You're genius!!!
As a math hater, this makes me wanna learn calculus
bro showed math to the next level
Still remember the feelings I got watching animator vs animation back in the day. As a physicist, I really appreciated the attention to detail here. Kudos.
i like

I called it "Math Battlegrounds"
it was like an alien invasion
Nah bruh i cant watch this video its too much numbers
that was awesome!
This is the most interesting Youtube video I ever seen

Orange very good to math
Es la mejor manera de explicar lo que teóricamente es complejo.
Как ты вообще это сделал?
This is the coolest way someone has used math. Love it!
I am a fan from Taiwan. I have found your videos to be very interesting since I accidentally saw your videos seven years ago. Thank you for bringing so many interesting videos. 🎉
А как же майнкрафт и другие человеки?
wow
Where is LN ????
But you know what? I don't see anyone pointing it out, so I'll say it: the personality of the main character is stunning. Childlike, curious, a bit thoughtless. Leaving aside the genius of the whole video - I can't stop thinking about the ending when he asked the e for help. Like, we played, we got to know each other, now I simply trust you not to hurt me. Seriously, i... ♥️
please create Animation vs mathematician
Thank you so much for making this masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed this and it made me laugh out loud. Thank you.
Love the Aleph-0 appearance at the end
This math make me very comfused i dont no the math now
it was pretty complex!

Math for the first time was fun...
What does that e something mean tho like it why it keeps running haha. BTW this is very entertaining to watch!.
i actually learned new things from this to show off, thanks alan!
It was awesome, but the numbers were so big that I could not understand them.
bro you did really!!!!
All the math I ever learned in high school and more.
1:40 Up until here, i dont know the math (i know multiplication and division though)
Where is the subscribe button
this is most amazing thing I have seen after a long time.... youtube is amazing
Makes you fall in love with maths Absolute masterpiece 👏
the fact that people analyzing and studied the reference of every formula in this video for 18 minutes or more... is stunning.
10:02😂😂
I'm loving it!❤
Next make Animation vs Sonic but take your time
А чего алеф больше зеты?
1+1 = 3
i learned more math watching this video than from my teachers my whole life
راسييي
More epic than any anime or game or anything fight could be. Also that sound design. OH MY FUCKING GOD
Hey, Alan, can you make Animation vs. undertale? And I want to say that you are the best animator I have ever seen ;)
Bro solved my math problems with animation☠️👍👍👍🔥
incredible math knowledge
Maths is Queen of Physics
Коли вивчив математику
I’m not nearly smart enough to understand this. But the comments tell me it’s accurate. Well done
how come Alan hasn't added calculator on the final battle againts king
You lost me after 1+1😭😭😭😭😭😭
Sound, animation, music, fight coriography, and storytelling all perfectly in sync.
Imagine if this whole entire video is just orange in Alan Becker‘s Calculator…
Better VFX than Adipurush! 🥶
Awesome Video
Wow  It is beautiful 😍😍
Jelloo
Can anyone plz tell me what was that black symbol at the end of video
Bro became Tony Stark in minutes
я нихуя на английском не понимаю
My fav ❣
Theory on why Euler's Number (EN) attacked TSC: My theory is that every number has a hunger. The more you summoned the less hungry you are. So, EN wasn't summonning that much (not much as one or two, anyway) so he felt a great hunger. That's why he kinda growled when he first meet TSC. Even though he is hungry, he runs away because he doesnt want to hurt TSC. So, when TSC wants to talk to EN, he fights, to not to kill or hurt TSC, but to protect him. I can prove this in 8:31 . If you look closely, you can see three EN clons actually helping TSC by growing the circle with the help of that angle symbol thingy. At the end, even though EN is hungry, he sees that TSC needs help and overcomes his hunger to help him out. That's why at the end other symbols that aren't summoned much congrats him, because he overcame his hunger. That's why I think TSC was a test for EN, because he is younger, (he is the smallest amongst them) he couldn't control his hunger but with this "test" he has proven that he can control his hunger. So yeah, TSC was a test, because he would come across EN eventually, for EN equals -1 and -1 isnt something hard to obtain. That's my theory, anyway.

This guy made me love maths 😂❤️
It all starts with a trampoline. Then we have stick figure animations.
Wow! A beautiful animation .

HE IS BACK!! ALAN BACKER IS BACK HERE!!!
Utterly delightful!
I dont know why but i kinda feel sad in the end
He should've destroyed math
Mini crewmate can beat this problem
Alan Becker is by far the smartest at math
This is incomprehensibly beautiful. This might spark a curiosity in the minds of many for years to come. Thankyou for making this.
Why is this animation so good !???
bro this shoulda been on cool math games wtf so crazy. so like when does the beta come out lol
How the heck did you make that?
This is so nostalgic. I remember rewatching the original animation vs minecraft soo many times when I was little.
This bring back bad memories
This is amazing!!! ... Someone in the public can explain me what i just saw?
genius. what a time to be alive!
I may need this video in the future to study Maths. What an educational video!
10:57 at this moment I held my breath
oscar worth it i can't stop watching it
holy crap, this is confusing to my brain.
Stunning! 👏👏👏👏
The creator of math
Absolutely superb. I'm an undergrad math major in my first year and it's videos like this that remind me of just why I chose to study math, truly it is an intricate subject with beauty hidden even in plain sight.

Yo yo yo! Alan, I just thought of a new idea! Can you guys do “Animation Vs. English”?
I feel like I'm not smart enough for this
as some who has no idea how math works, this is a masterpiece
Pls part 2
Imma show this to all my students
The best to learn mathematics
If TSC Good at math be like:
This video make me feel dumb on a whole other level
1+1+2
Can u pin me
Imma wait til I finish high school then come and be slightly less confused

Better plot than majority of 2023 releases.
Amazing, you guys are Genius!

totally incredible what this man does, he is a master of animation and it amazes me how he fulfills each property of the numbers, a great animator
Это лучше что я смотрел в своей жизни!!!
i never was going to think that math was bad ass like holy and now there's a new villan aparentlly? becuase why would they just spawn there

Waw ! Genia!,!❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is something anyone can understand, no matter their language. True storytelling doesn't need words!

Astonishing!
I thought this was made years ago. Mainly because it's pretty rare to find a gem like this nowadays.
Question for the sound guy....  what are sound bytes used when the numbers/formula change?  Its so vexingly specific and familiar.  (Keep thinking Nowhere Prophet, but not even close to being sure)

Amazing
the sound design is so good
Easily one of the coolest math videos I've ever seen  -Math Teacher
I saw on a video that every stick man has been evil except Green.
Hello Alan ummm.  I saw your video 16 years ago
Wdrze001🎉😇🥰
Increíble no es suficiente para describir está obra de arte
10:35 THAT WAS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
The animation is on the other end of the spectrum from the science nonsense you see in spy/superhero movies
This was awesome
😊😊my favorite subject
Nah what the heck This was so cool i didnt understand half of it
First voice line?! 10:03
🧭👍
Bro when integral 0 to  infinity appeared I was super hyper ,the whole video kept me on hedge fr
nice 😏
씨발 존나 개쩔어
This is one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.
Please SAL KHAN needs to be the background voice of this movie!!! @khanacademy
Mind Blown!!! I didnt even know math could go THAT far
Math has never been this EPIC!!
I don't know what it is, but I can only admire the action scenes.(e is so cute )
9:06 the whole universe
Every single one of my students is being shown this at the earliest possible moment. What an outstanding piece of art which captures the wonder and beauty of mathematics!!
exc+llent animation

As a (passionate) math student, this video is just great and amazing. One of my favorites videos.
Asi que tu eres el sádico qué hace estas animaciones enfermas eee. Perdon si use mal el sarcasmo, pero solo quiero comentar, que admiro mucho su trabajo, el de usted y el de sus colaboradores, es casi perfecto. No puedo creer que nunca supe de usted hasta hace unos días. Es tan increíble que no me salen las palabras correctas, excepto, gracias por esta obra de arte❤.
Who needs school when Alan Becker can teach you the fun way?
Please do medical animation
Cool
no entendi ni verga pero creo que respondiste esos problemas matematicos bien xd
Elden gelen bişey yok . Anlamıyoz ama baya eğlenceli
I enjoy the feeling that knowledge flashes through my mind without leaving any trace (doge)
bro made math interesting
Damn they really did orange hole guy dirty
Empezó con matemáticas básicas y luego se paso aprendiendo matemáticas con Alan becker
No entiendo porque no me deja responder a YouTube XD
Good
Шедевр, а автор гений
Trust nobody
Keep up the excellent work 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

Absolutely brilliant animation and fun way math is being represented here! Only a little confused about 4:16 with that trig Euler expansion, why only cos negative here? Kudos to a great video!
Just amazing 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
"to solve a problem you need to create more problems"
Bro worm video on your channel is fire bro
Amazing storytelling
Love it! Best thriller I've seen this year! And so educating!
Me: The maths are not very hard The maths: ...
guys, that's just the gameplay on Richard Watterson on Calculator 2

good likeeee <3
This is the only time beside elementary school where math is cool
can you please make him divide by zero??
The identities at the end were his buddies, that is a very nice final touch to this masterpiece, the golden ratio, unite impulse, riemann's function and euler's identity walked together to the infinity, just poetical
I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. i have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , gotta move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating.

This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42. I am crying. This has made me go through an emotional rollercoaster. I cried, beat off, and also watched a movie while watching this premiere. This has made me go through so much. I passed depression because of this. It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.
My favorite animation
YouTube still commenting on ur videos 🎉
very funny xD
Schools should use this.
I regret having only | 1 | like to give.
best video ever
Grade 12 math was wworth it just so I could understand more about this
Muazzam 🙌🙌

John Wick 5?
absolutely magnificent , you are amazing!
this is gonna be me when i take ap calc ab
Это прекрасно! Я думаю это видео может помочь понять математику или вспомнить её особенности. А анимация, господи! Как же анимация прекрасна! Это шедевр! 100%/100%
What the hell did you guys smoke to make this ??  25/10
It comes to show the complexity of math.
I liked how u let the math be true
Very good mathematical recreation!!... But- Could someone tell me, which formulas are the ones that appear at the end?
eiп
I didin't know math was this cool
Learning calculus has never felt like Marvel before
I want to study maths now to understand this whole video
bro really made math exciting
6:25
PLEASE REDO ANIMATOR VS ANIMATION III🎉
Its so mind blowing
Bro really took 18 years of study to make this video💀💀💀
я с это во видео математику понел больше чем на уроке
Thats the stuff teachers should show kids in the first place and then ask if anyone will learn how to do "math" 🤯😎🤙
Speechless
this hurts my brain
Bruh did u even watch the math episode? Math was defending itself.
_your maths is blowing my mind_
Круто
You made me love math again. Thanks!
This guy must be Asian
Alan benker saca es te video como juego muy divertido y muy difícil para las personas que seatreven atodo por favor
Reminds me of how much my high school math teacher emphasized the impact of -1
I really liked the video now I wait for the animation vs alphabet 😊😊
Are you saying The + End means string concatenation? There's a more formal way to express that.
OMG! You are insane, I love and enjoy what I see so much!! <3
thats sick
Absolutely genius‼️🙌😌
4:13
I DON'T KNOW CALCULUS WHAT DO I DO
insane
🗿🗿🗿lo acepto ES CINE
Hey Alan! My teacher showed us after the exam! It was very cool!
WOW impresionante trabajo que hiciste solo para esta maravilloso nuevo capitulo gracias por leer (seguro que no lo va a leer no sabe español tmb los demas users jafksk)
Nol is the end was it for me. Absolutely amazing
I would like math if it looked just like this
e π K
Alan explained the entire math curriculum for grades 1-9 in Russian schools in 15 minutes. Bruh.
bro found a way to make math epic
ALAN PLS CREATE A STICKMAN ANIMATION OF GEOMETRY DASH
It never ceases to amaze me just how far this series has come since the original A.V.A.s from Newgrounds and UGOPlayer all those years ago.
Dance Fights plss ❤
this is 5 year old me first time playing with the phone calculator
Only those who have ten years of experience in quantum physics will understand the references🤓☝
He need a oscar for this dude
can we have a prequel how Orange got into math world ?
I dont think alan its gonna read this but anyway im going to ask for anybody who knows the answer  Is AvA and AvM related?, since in AvA we saw all the thing about TCO (The Chosen One) and about Orange powers, but in AvM we never saw any thing related to TCO or about Orange powers, so i got this question.  If anybody knows the answer pls tell me (sorry for bad english)
This is teaching me stuff I know and this is how you know Alan is smart
And now I feel stupid for not understand most of the equation
You have such an incredible way of seizing an idea and expanding upon it in untold ways 10/10
68+1=💀
Genuinely one of the sickest videos I've ever seen

Keren banget animasi nya, g nyesel nonton
Alan ơi,làm về khoa học đi có toán r
I think I’m better at math now
Nice video. ❤❤❤
Это было потрясающе! Ох, как бы мне хотелось увидеть продолжение про физику.
This feels like a Pixar movie
ok, ok. this is a masterpiece; there is no doubt about that. BUT, or because of that, I came up with the undeniable proof that (tau) is better in every way possible to (pi). Hear me out: you could have introduced your antagonist (e^i(pi)) a lot earlier.   After the protagonist (TSC) touches 1 and you show 1 = 1,  you could have shown 1 = e^i(tau).  This would have created an even better cinematographic pacing. This would have hinted towards the interconnectivity of all things earlier. Yes, this would have been too big of a jump, but your antagonist, in this case e^i(tau), could have just escaped, like before.  q.e.d.
bro beacame the smartest person in 14mins
0÷0=?
that was the best experience of my entire life
Fenial
This video shows why I hate math
yooo
This animation is amazing.
bro this is insane
Im waiting for part 2
Creativity+epic actions+math=
Part 2 please coming
I am speechless...
i only knowed to 1 elevated to 6
EXCİT was soo gooodd
такие видео по математике я люблю , ничего не понятно, но очень интересно
you should definitely make a animation vs geometry dash! the stickmen could be jumping around avouding obstacles
I don't understand a single math thing that is happening here, I just know this animation blasted me away.
the 14 fastest minutes of my life ! It perfect
The aleph cameo at the end goes so incredibly hard
more this type
Thats wow❤
After a year i forgot all i learn in math dam
Loved it; I wonder if AI can create such stuff.!?
sent this to my math teacher lol
my brain is in shambles
what a great story i can tell you put a lot of work into this
Animation vs Terraria pls
Aleph Null at the end is like an end credit scene hinting at a Multiverse
I'm not a mathematician, but at some point I've got absolutely speechless, and then I realized it was only a few minutes into the video, and I've got extra 10 minutes left to watch of escalating insanity and pure art
This is best video to learn math 😂
@dateunvlog podrias explicar la matematica usada en un video?
Wow ! 😮
Bro is going to a math battle😂
Part 2?
Simplification
cool, let's do the next physics pls
Poor e at the end.
❤
🤩
This made my day!
This guy knows how to make an action movie out of math! Can you make a movie out of this?
Did he just took himself out of equation?
This is the best thing on YouTube since the Alphabet lore!
спасибо очень классно
wow...... amazing
Yo despues de una hora en la calculadora
Bruhh, That's Was insane!! I was use to think that to maths & science formulas as in actions but you made it not just possible but brilliantly amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Most Dynamic Math Video
Definately need a physics one
Bruhh. This was fire 🔥. Not just the animation and the fight scenes, but also the concept and the mathematical equations which all makes sense. Using them perfectly to make a movie like this. This is incredible. 🤯🤯
la mayor fumada que he visto en mi drogada vida Xd
Okay I get it! You actually absorbed what you were taught in calculus! Quit showing off!
I'm telling you guys who don't understand all the maths references here : this video is brilliant, you should do maths only to understand it
لازم تكون فاهم الرياضيات اله تشوف هل القتال ، وفي النهاية e^iπ=-1
WOW alan is life it is so cool man
Alan Becker you have 22.8milions subs lets go 23 milions
i really love internet for this man
It's the best movie that i've been watched
Now I can give my maths exam
It'll be more fun if yu know the properties he's using. Great job
I loved it
Будет 2
i wish there was a game like this where u use different functions variables and formulas to fight and gincrease ur strength to fight the opponent , i kn its kinda cheesy but
My man made the death Star bro
Finally now I will use math for something in life
Very funny
This vedeos must earn a prize,,, please someone appreciate him properly,,, it is un believable
Astonishing! Incredible! Just like every animation of yours!
At the end the Aleph letter just in the background to symbolise infinity!
Good videos
Unbelievable. The amount of knowledge and fun in a single video is beyond my wildest dreams. Please do more with other subjects.
4:42 THE POWER OF THE PLUS COMPELS YOU
Bro made math funny
What 5th dimension actually looks like:
Man imagine if there was an animation vs science there would be a periodic table then the orange would mix and make the elements to form things like he makes liquid hydrogen to attack the enemy This is a video idea
Love from india or (t.h)
Amazing
Amazing..... Simplified and Coherent. Which software do you use?
bro I remember old days thank you so much
Bro add a part 2
He used + - × = ÷ Then Δ Σ ! π θ  😮😮😮
Damn this is almost as confusing as my science exam.
He kinda used physics but cool
This is the true definition of creativity
The guy who made it was a genius👏👏👏👏
최고의 수학 시각화
one word only it's INCREDABLE....................🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍
Next time must build the *Animation VS JavaScript*
I liked how alan used the math in a progresive form that start with + and — and we finish with matematics reasons
Amazing Just Amazing
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥😃👍🙂😀😉
천재다
nah i still hate math
wtf what happend
amazing
Need part 2 😮😮
This is a new level of creativity. Insane!
What gender are they?
Watching this video from the e's point of view makes it much more understandable. At the beginning, the e just wants to be left alone to the annoyance of TSC. However, the e only turns hostile after TSC pins it to the ground, provoking a counter attack and keeps running away. At this point the e becomes geniunely scared of TSC, turns into the sigma cannon and attacks TSC to keep him away from itself. After the sin cannon by TSC, the e becomes increasingly desperate and makes copies of itself to eliminate this threat to it's survival. (Some of the copies do help TSC though. Interesting how that works.) At the end, the e realises that TSC is not a threat but rather a friend. The e was really fighting for it's survival the entire time. An absolute Masterpiece though EDIT: The e really looks happy and relieved at the end with his friends!
The only thing I fully understood. Was the sound effects lol.
Euler's formula ^^)/
O m g math class joined
Math is my fav subject of the year!
I learned college math in 14 minutes.

i dont understand math but this is FIRE! cool animation
The greatest animated movie I've ever  seen
This is the greatest video in the world!!!!

Wow! Beautiful. 😊
absolutely genius
The thing about making the sine and cosine waves off the unit circle reminded me of my math class we took last year, thank god it’s over!
it's very very cool
쌈@뽕하네
I love you animation
Ну, в целом такая штучка может замотивировать изучить матан, но только на пару дней. Я всё равно плавлюсь от всех этих циферок-буковок, но догадываюсь, какой это кайф понимать принципы того, что было показано на экране, поэтому - работа великолепная, пусть и не для всех.
Today I literally visualize math .
wow ,that was amazing. i loved it.
я один пришел увидеть коммент ютуба
I didn‘t know that -1 is that aggressive

one of the best videos i have ever seen
I knew if i didn't watch this, I'd feel empty  I love math
천재적이다👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
It's so amazing!!!!!!
Thank you for making this from the bottom of my heart. (You guys did a terrifyingly good job with the animation. And Terkoiz, I think this was genius.)
Incredible animation!
WE NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED MORE VIDEOOS LIKE THIS!!!!
why was this so good
i just KNOW if i was still in high school i would've sent this video to my physics teacher and we wouldve watched it in class
Next week love it

The number that keeps running, I can tell it’s a weird and ginormous number, capable of doing many weird stuff with math, which is the reason why it can do cool things
Power of math
This video is slowly increasing my intelligence as I’m only in 4th grade
Did anybody get the last part?????? Why is the set of N depicted as a god to the complex numbers??
👍👍👍
Correct me if I’m wrong in anything I said
Everything I said is the same with negative numbers
If you make a negative number before the answer without parenthesis and without having addition right behind it or in front, it’s subtraction, and the answer is a negative number if it were but not subtraction
Math lore
왜ㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅖㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㅓㆍ amazing
In math, after the number 9, they add another digit, and after 10 the numbers are repeated and what I just said repeat over and over but the numbers are bigger but end the same way Edit: Well if you spam 1, yes this is the rule if you add 1 infinitely. Edit x 2: I forgot what I was gonna edit in the edit so I just added punctuation.
Alan becker can make anything funny
I already liked math, but this is a masterpiece, I knows things far beyond me, yet Alan becker is a literal built-in masterpiece himself, HE is the masterpiece.

can you make a science?
can you make a science?
We need a game that accumulates school math that way!!!!
A great Video for Math lovers.i like math.i follow alan from the start of   AVM. thanks alan for making this math video.plase start a series of it
4:17 nice joke. Stick man beat by negative character make him negative position haha
i wonder if he learnt this from 3Blue1Brown
I guess I need to learn more 'bout Math, that's so hard but a little bit interested :)
my brainn Hurts!!?,
You can't just leave us with an end 😢. We need part 2
Изучение математики с аланом бекером!😂
The coolest animation i ever seen
Thats awesome!!   Like a math-path student, i love this!
in 4:16 should be -(cos(pi)+isin(pi))
That's awesome! Now, for personal personal delight, I want a "Animetion vs Music theory" in this exact same style!   Dang! How cool it would be!
best
aww
Bro that's crazy ❤❤
Soo this is the real math😮😂

2d animations are the best
It's awesome!
That looks so clean
If there was a game like this, everybody would be taking math classes
❤❤❤❤❤
this is so good even my brother's teacher send him this!
That was an crazy, how much detail do you put in a single video 😂
это гениально!
nice =)
What is the date of birth of The Second Coming?
Бригаду
It's crazy that these stick figures are 8 years old💀
Music name plz🌚
Mathematics 🙇
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻 i like this
The best Animation vs in my opinion
6:17 😶
Spoiler blocker
Me in my calculus exam Except instead of a good end i get a bad end where it eviscerated me
I don’t like math but know I do 🤓
이 영상으로 난 더욱 알렌님을 존경하게 되었다
From now on math is my favorite super power
amazing, watching this two days before Mathematics exam, really wiped exam stress and Math Anxiety from my mind. love your videos and bro lots of support and good luck. keep it up!
Это самое эпичное видео , которое я когда-либо видела
you me detsva podoril
OMG IT S THE BEST MATH I EVER SEE IN MY LIFE HAHAHAHA
Einstein's dreams:
Perfectly splendid!
It's unbelievable how much this got stolen 😢 I saw it cut down and reposted multiple times by multiple ppl on facebook one version even had a tiktok logo, so someone stole it, put it on tiktok, then someone stole the stolen version and put it on facebook .... I've been sharing the original link in the comments but not everyone reads the comments or cares to support the original creator ... sadly
Imaginary world sure is scary
I never thought math could be this epic.
my favorite subject is math
A whole video explaining why the most beautiful equation in mathematics is the most beautiful equation in mathematics 😂
I can't comprehend what i just happen to watch ... but I loved it.
How is this so good
Wow, I didn’t expect the math in this video to be so complex 😏🥁
Where is animation Vs physics
Uh in think for minutes u can make animation vs football its cool for me 😊
Literally the dream of an engineering student after studying calculus
Great work...amazing
This is the best animated short film of 2023.
Fight against e^(i*pi).
GOAT!!!
An animation masterpiece ✅ A cinematic masterpiece ✅ A mathematical masterpiece ✅ A physics masterpiece ✅ Cinematography ✅ Sound design ✅ Everything is so perfect
10:01 bro really said weeeeeee💀
Bro, I wished this was how we learn math back in the day at elementary.
wow..... I did not understand all the logics but it was very cool and informative, helps so much to visualize mathematics....
4:22 Should've had parenthesis there, e^(i(π - π)). Otherwise the best video I will see this decade
THE SPINNING COMING
Youtube have a channel in Youtube 😂
when animation vs meth
Please animation vs ark
Mind-blowing, fan6,excellent.  What a concept!!!!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😮
this is what i think so far  Calculus = pain
Who the hell was complaining about math gameplay!!!?
wait what if that was his dream when he was captured back during the animators vs animations maybe this thinking will come in use during another battle.
10:33 ENEMY AC1 30 ABOVE!!!!
Просто гений
That all I need to graduate from maths
ngeri memang bilangan-bilangan irrasional
Learn math with Alan
very nice
Hey alan video suggestions: Animation vs. skibidi toilet
literally loved it man this should get more views. I was straight smiling throughout the entire video.
bro you're goddamn genius
Jerome poline pun bingung melihat ini
Awesome video
Animation vs. Programming next?
이 영상은 이과들의 마음을 자극시킵니다
pls make video "stickmans got into the flat world, can't come back and trying to survive in this flat world".
My homework be like
09:25 actual infinity stone
I wish my brain is like that when I'm doing math equations. That'd be even more fun.
Today, I regret very much why I didn't continue the exercises and now I don't understand the calculations and I'm very sad.
Absolutely brilliant
Loves it ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is how solar system works👍 5:49
this is where my maths tr said maths will be useful later in life.
The Second Coming is a very smart stick figure. He’s a quick thinker and a fast learner lol
BEST ANIMATED VIDEO EVER. JUST A MASTERPIECE
if my school had the same math, then I would love it more than ever
Yeah 1+1=2🤓
Now this is the alan becker i know and loved❤️‍🔥
I can’t believe what I just saw
Wow the video really was ‘complex’ 😂
❤️
OMG. Absolutely astonishing 🔥
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The music is so underrated ! The symphony that adds instruments as the numbers and operations get more complex ! It's awesome !
This is the only reason I like math now
Got blanked from eiπ 🤌
This is the definition of what everyone thought math was before they actually learned it
This was absolutely beautiful. This truly shows how far the rabbit hole of imaginary numbers really goes and how deep euler's identity actually goes. I wish that imaginary numbers and trig identities were of more importance in high school and early college classes; this is some of the most beautiful parts of math that hardly anyone gets to see. Thank you for making this gorgeous animation.
I just learned whole math in just 10 minutes
This would make for a really cool game
just awesome!
This could be good for a math presentation
DELIGHTFUL  But why was 'e' scared of him at first?
This guy can make anything interesting.
do wanted part 2 plssssssssssssssssssss
Now, you must do " Animation vs Programming"
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Insanely well done ! Great job!!
Impeccable sound effects
Can u make this a movie😁
If this is the way I studied maths in school I think i would be in M.I.T now😂😂
This is how Mach was created
Jeremy it's better than drugs!!
Animation.VS.ALGEBRA....  Video ...........PLEASE.........
This is magic of our world😵
absolutely legendary
Bro smarter than Einstein
MY MIND NEED HELP
This is the type of content i pay bills for..❤❤
Bro discussed whole math 🗿
There are so many math concepts that this video so excellently depicts
Pro the end 😂
No no no mister fish you wont to go his famaly you wont to go his ebanyi tazik blyat come mr fish this good place
ни**я себе
We really need a part 2 of this, it was so great!
Все зашли сюда чтобы посмотреть комментарий Ютуба?
1+1= 2
Amazing!
Genius and incredible work this wasn’t easy to make and deserve to be the video of the year 🎉 🫡
we'll be waiting for "Animation vs Geometry" and "Animation vs Biology"
Abstraction math very well, that 's Wonderland...
imaginary number very great work good job
Yeaaaahhh he can def beat goku
WFT DUDE HOW YOU CAN MAKE ME HYPE WITH MATH?!?!
I did not understand any of that advanced calculus stuff.
After 10 years YouTube recommended me this video..🐸😸✨
♥️♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
Bro rocked with just 1=1
Amazing,,,,,
這個真的火🔥
Best animation I have ever seened
17m in 10 days. Jesus.
It was incredibly mind blowing, Soo great ... Left me speechless 😶
From 1+1 to The + end    Incredible😍
My Brain : 💥
Joss polll
are we all going to ignore the fact orange made a perfect circle
Math  lore real
this is cinema
My brother would understand all this math stuff waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more than I ever could.
This is amazing I have a though could you soon make a video about music notes you don't have to. Great video tho 😁
PART 2 PLEASE
I like how it takes us years to learn this stuff and it takes this stick figure 6 minutes to learn all kinds of math.
❤❤❤❤
im so sad im not high while watching this
this is like new age "stickman vs animator". i love it so much! great work

=f(∞)
It really is fantastic, although also many Chinese people can't see directly, but someone to share the last, so come and pay tribute to the original authors, the likes of encouragement, look behind
Alan, if i could ask can you do The King vs pig
Me after summer:
howhow會很愛這部片。
anyone here knows about gigantic creature in the end? Its aleph.
i like happy endings =)
Let wait for the physic one
Masterpiece!
that was amazing how did you know how to use everything, the most impressive was the wave function with sin, and cos. this was well thought out
Stikman vs euler
所有淡江大的同學發給我這一部視頻的連結
4:59  Me in school trying to get good grade😂
lmao the giant aleph at the end. ordinal numbers gonna be wild in there
Next you should do animation vs the alphabet
Alan Becker you're the best YouTuber ever because you make my favorite videos Minecraft and Stickman when I when I was 8 years old I made some old comics about your stickman stickman make for some reason I made blue and red fall in love but that's your decision to make but the best thing you can do can you tell series of victim please😁♥️👍
Brilliant animation！🤩
Xem để giải trí mà áp lực quá 🤣
При помощи этой анимации можно стать великим математиком
This is amazing video
One of the best innovative animation to tell about maths Well done
i love that ending with ℵ0 bigger than the others  lol
א
E
It captures the struggles of understanding math in the most acurate way.
Alan Becker, this is a masterpiece. Absolutely wonderful. Well done.
We want physics and chemistry also❤🎉😊
수학 선생님의 새로운 과제😂
There's a difference from me knowing how square roots worked in 8 years then a stick figure with no apparent brain figuring it out in 220 seconds. Then another 3 years to learn i, and another 20 seconds for ol' sticky.
I hate math but this is sick
Euler公式那一段挺有意思的，但是数学真正让人着迷的地方在于形式的简洁与逻辑的严密，正如从微积分的创立到Cauchy意识到无理数是有理数列的极限再到戴德金…
a matemática sendo útil pra minha vida ...
Anyone can explain e^iπ part
Can you make a video is about animation vs chemistry?
He is getting smarter than his friend yellow
Смотреть эти анимации так расслабляюще
Bro creo el mejor video de matemáticas de yt y creyó que no nos daríamos cuenta 💀
wow that was incredible
I know my comment won't be noticed by you but still Thankyou sooo much for such awesome visualisation Alan sir
bro explained my entire school curriculum this year in 4 minutes.
경이롭다 진짜
Can u pls do vids and not shorts
I never thought i’d be entertained by an orange stick figure fighting a funky little E using math. Yet here we are.
I was taught more here than school  Ready to graduate now 🤓🎓
why wasn't math this much interesting during my years of highschool and college ..🥲
THAT WAS AMAZING YOUR WORK KEEPS GETING BETTER.
One of the Best animations i ever saw
advanced math in real life if paper did not exist yet.
te la rifastes fernando
quá hay
this is so satisfying
Muito bom, parabéns 👏
please make a game
Bro is like a full movie
12
Alan is teaching stuff I haven't even learned yet
16 years ago, all started with a trampolin.
Alan becker is such a icon such a legend that even the platform owners of youtube know him and sometimes coment to them alan becker did a inpact on the hole internet to such grade that almost no one has ever did
pov : me in my maths lessons
Bro made from red and black stickman figth to a whole netflix series
I don't understand math :>
Man, this is an absolute masterpiece.
Pure evil
PLS animator vs animation VII
now, THIS math is fun
ITS ALEPH! ITS ALEPH! ADD THE NULL ITS ALEPH NULL!!!
When movies follow physics and math rules in action scenes
Dont buy a Math Calculator, Buy an Alan Becker!
we got to see the whole history of math and this video is really amazing it inspires me more when it comes to math :)
The quality tho
This sound design is so fucking cracked
Everything makes sense lol
Las matemáticas vs los estudiantes
I liked how it all started with one question then he ended up fighting the whole darkness to find the equation that opens the way out of it all!
This could've been a Regular Show episode!!
This could've been a Regular Show episode!!
Bro used all concepts of math in a single video 😂😂😂
what?!, this will never finish if you keep moving these
why cant Alan be our teacher
I really like this movie!
2:37 aaand you lost me
미아너스 받았을때 뒤집혔엌ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ개쩔어
So proud I clicked on this
Let's go Animation vs Terraria
WHO SAID THAT MATH AND PHYSICS ARE BORING!!
Believe it or not, all animated in desmos
Dude this is going to get a lot of views! Let me take my place now!!
X 3 all of my food and money
this is my life i dont know math but i fantasy my life to just keep ignore the questions and life and everything fighting is everything
orange learned in 10 minutes what a normal person would learn in 30 years
This was amazing.
অসাধারণ। ❤ ধন্যবাদ এরকম একটি ভিডিও উপহার দেওয়ার জন্য।
Man,this is just... Outstanding ❤
if e^i*π was already that strong how would TSC handle the others?
How to learn maths in one hour 💀💀
Incredible animation, the best I've seen in my life 😃😃
You inspired me to make animations
La reacción de matemáticas 😦
?§∆
Super homosexual su video
Alan, you're great at it
Bro learned everything about math in 14 minutes and i don't know sh*t after 14 years
This is soooooooooooooooooo good its amazing.
Math is one of my least favourite subjects and yet I've been watching this over and over for the past day or so
17 million views in just 10 days. Damn
E’s friends are so cute and gentle to him, like the colossal nugget was so peacefully walking like “Let’s go play frens!” In a deep and low voice 🥺
TSC: i need help here Yellow: you know, i'm something scientist myself
Alan please post more
The best anamation ever!😃😀
Stop him he's getting too powerful by lauded
Incrível a animação! Te prende do início ao fim!
MATH IS SO EASY😆😆😆😆
Bro you neeeeeeeeeed to make more of these there SO COOL I love math and that just made my day
It's just mind-boggling how beautiful and incredible it is. This is a masterpiece.
Why was orange just laying there
Siiiiiick
=)
me: goes to school for 12 years  learns some calculus Silly stick figure man: fully understands imaginaries and calc 3 in 3 minutes 😭
WOW you done math maybe nextime u do science hehe
Me taking 500 years to understand math orange doesnt even need sound to tell him how it works
professores:a matemática vai influenciar no seu futuro  eu usando a matemática pra acabar com o bandido que invadiu minha casa: 8:29
Very easy math
bro dosnt  need a oscar the oscar needs him and he needs a netflix movie
This channel suprise us everytime
We no.t know what is happening
Absolutly bestest coolest math videos ever.
The stickman understood math faster than i in 6 years
that's wrong 6÷0=0
Surprisingly ! I love maths after watching this ! One of if not the best video I’ve watched in my life 🫶🏻
This is how we should teach math!
3:44 Orange just broke the 4th wall leaving the numbers to more than 1 trillion ☠

Beauty of math❤😂
Mais animação versus Roblox
No entendi mucho pero me gusto😂
This is such a great work!!!🎉
This what I mean when I ask my teacher to make math fun
🤩
Stilé
.O.
What about the "א "??? But yeah the animation was SICK
Amazing, it's made so well, you can see there was so much work put into it, one of the most interesting animations I've ever seen
this stick figure learned more math in 14 minutes than i have in 12y
9:06 why is the radial line not perpendicular to the circumfrence at the point it touches the circle?
Incredible
여러분 고등수학까지만 공부해도 대부분 이해 할 수 있습니다. 근데 저는 절반 조금 넘게 밖에 이해 못함 ㅋㅋ
Cara, isso esta incrivel! Eu não entendi absolutamente nada mas isso é muito bom!
Is very good the math Alan Becker
…
Dude, 1+1=11
Is very easy,medium and difficult 😞
Disappointed we didn’t get into conjectures or topology or something like that Would’ve loved to see The Game Of Life make a cameo
:o
Wow
10:00 Elden Ring boss
Could this be the very origin?
Smooth animation!!!
I love this!!!
when you leave babies with Mozart on for 0.0000001 second
Hello, I'm a new subscriber, I like a lot your animations, they're so cool... I am good with maths and I also put too happy when it is good. I have an idea to do an animation, I tried to do it, but it's difficult, so I want your help... Would you help me, please? Sorry is my English is bad or difficult to understand, I am Colombian and I'm trying to learn. Have a nice day, and I hope you answer my comment

the best youtube video i ever watched so far <3
This tought me more math then my teacher😭
warning: requires understanding to understand! Not that I do...
The true definition of a math battle
Dark souls con matematica
Hasta en mi clase de matematicas eh visto este video xddd
I am at a loss of words....This is the most enjoyable piece of content i have ever consumed in my life 🤩True master of the art
Up Next: Animation Vs Programming
this tickled my brain
Bro taught me more about math than my teacher would ever hope to do
It's amazing! Near I learned Complex Analysis)
Average math test difficulty
math ❤💯💯
woooow es increible!!!!
Simply Genius!
IT WAS WONDERFUL
your lead animator has extremely good ideas! this could be shown to high school students. the amount of attention to detail!
Please help me figure it out. If there is a certain limit transition here and the sum of a series of dimensional space of Euclidean turns into a definite, Improper integral...but. What kind of function are we talking about here? I see sine integral on the right...could it be him? 🤔
I hate math but I love this video
Awesome!
So let's say I understood this but why is that Euler's formula to be most powerful.
bro is teaching me more math than my teacher💀
I can’t believe this stickman learned math in less then 15 minutes while I’m still in school
pov: your math classes after you skipped just a one day
Animation vs Animator  And now this. Another legendary video.
Wow
2-8+8=?
How'd he get there tho
Is everything supposed to make sense?
Wish I understood math a little more so I can enjoy this to the fullest potential 😔
That’s a hard video to make, all that non-linear math
Masterpiece🔥
Imagine Animation vs physics 💀
Alan se lo tomo literal de lo de la matematica es poder XD
Not just fabulous animation, profound mathematics, and outstanding sound design; the things that go behind it also include absolutely marvellous storytelling.  There has to be a sequel to this, you know? Some multidimensional madness with quaternions, vecters, matrices, and other, crazier stuff.
In conclusion: Euler is immortal
New title: how to make math fun
😢imbouttacry
This man needs an oscar for short animations and needs this stuff on netflix like “if something happens i love you”
Omg ur buddy is so smart 🤯
Esse vídeo é muito bom
Stick figures before Animation vs. Math: Alan: "What's 9 + 10?" All: "21." Alan: "You stupid."
WOW! as a math expert, im chocked
This is a masterpiece!
Thx for the tip of math,second one and e 😎👍
As an applied mathematics bachelor, I love this
This is what my nightmares look like as a math-noob, preparing for her final economics exam...
MAKE👏🏻THIS👏🏻A👏🏻VIDEO GAME👏🏻NOW
That was lit 🔥
10:34 tsc:now You die
Why don't you make a series that's on TV like you and your dolls, you should definitely get it
Whit the maths fabriching arms🤑
As a physicist I got to say, this was incredible. I was literally smiling all the way through because of how amazing this was. It captures the math so good and the animations representing the individual math operations, simply astonishing.
i love it! make a part 2 plz
NGL, this was satisfying to watch
So far I’m not understanding anything!🙆🏾💔
Its me or the fluidity of the animation got upgraded
Math is now my fav subject
Was imagining the end dude dividing by zero and making a black hole or something.
Oh boy, can't wait for a part two where Orange and the boys will have to come back to save the math world because there's a disturbance in the force.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Better than Marvel Film, love it! Hope we have an explain for each scences~
This explains the reaosn I like math, its chaotically organized, there are systems put in place but there are also madness everywhere
to muselo dát hoooooooooooodně práce na druhou x 3 + 20 hodin  =  milion let animování :DDD
I would love to see "Animation vs. Musical Notation"
This gives my brain a work-out and a massage at the same time.
"WÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆÆ"  E^(I*π)
Hi Alan, it's so nice to see you again
Math is only fun when you have a little war with it
what?
Now this is how you teach math.
This is genuinely super awesome
This Is Probably TSC's Inner Mind Thinking About Math Because Outside Of His Mind He's Probably So Bored. Btw My Theory Is That TSC Is Entering Every Subject In His Mind, I Think The One That's Stronger Then Every Subject Except Math Is Probably Physics.
This is the most brilliant piece of mathly animation I've ever seen in my life. The TIME and skills it took to do, and do accurately is just amazing. 😍
Who let orange cook?
My math teacher be like 👩‍🏫
This is what world war III will look like
bro can teach me more than school while keeping me entertained
I love maths now😅
When complexity and creativity is at its best.. and also they are hand in hand coming together..
bok gibi hiç beğenmedim
Solo entendi la pelea xdd
If only the Japanese could make an anime out of this. It would bang hard!
Friend: Math is boring Me:
What is the song on the background?
Puri Jindagi m itni maths nhi dekhi thi bhai😂
im gonna show this to someone before a math exam
why does multiplying i by e^{i(pi)} open a doorway? I feel like theres some math joke I'm missing there
Ah yes, the history of my battle with math till I graduated.
Animation vs people playground

This man doesn't need an Oscar, the Oscar needs him.
This is amazing.
A maths animation made me emotional for e^iπ damn
I love this channel! Never fails to make me smile 😊😁. Hope you have a great day, Alan!
I understood maybe half of this, i'm so proud of my self lol
this is amazing.
I learned Math in this video more than 12 years of school
Its... Math
3:37 ещё и -2
If only math was like this in school it would be the best subject.
You outdid yourself with this video. This was genuinely one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen and now I think math is awesome so thank you for helping me get through calc lol
Sensational
He went from Kindergarten to Twelfth grade in fourteen minutes
Einstein would be proud
11:02 the "math" star
Finally, a video I can show to people that think I don't watch anything educational : )
The poor creature later surrendered! 😢
Thank you for that ☺️🔥  Now we know what maths exactly is 🥰
1+1=2
💀
i have no idea whats happening but its so cool
This is math in 2023
👏👏👏
Это выглядит потрясающе. И вся эта красота математики. Просто прекрасно
delicious
This is insane storytelling, I feel like I just watched Avengers Endgame 😁💯
I can proudly sat this is my favourite video now❤😮
El skitman entendiendo como funciona las matemáticas 🤓👍
אני ראיתי את האות א שמה או שזה רק אני ואגב אתם יודעים עברית?
5 high school attempts, aced everything......but math......I'm 31 and a half as of 7/4/2023 and I am a firm believer that not bombarding young kids with just "open the book, figure it out, i want it by tomorrow" is not the answer....to be honest I was super pumped to watch this but after being told that "I am retarded" by my own late mother which does not happen to be true, left a scar, and being told by teachers that “he just does not get it” and literally not helping when I asked for help and explanation, left a scar, and I am not pandering for likes or anything, my point here is that people have different ways of learning, some are visual, some are more straight to the point and can catch the drift of what they have with just a brief explanation and being “rooted out” just by not understanding something does not mean one is incapable of understanding. I wish schools and teachers left behind the old ways of "we are just quality control and you are defective, here, have a C or a 6 or 60" or whatever you have in your country.
🤓👆
Nah bro, this is how they should teach maths
I gave up around 6 mins
10:47 MEANS HE HAS INFINITE POWER

*When you are doing mathematics and suddenly remember that you have to do animation💀*
This is one of the few YouTubers that I would say deserves more subscribers! Bro this is sick especially as an engineering student 😂😂
I only got up to math 112 in college, so i got lost about half way through, but my god this is both entertaining and brilliant.
That would be cool if you could do that in real life
Writing Sqrt(-1) = i does not make any sense as sqrt is a function defined on R+. Students of the world you may write i^2 = -1 (that is the definition of the imaginary number) but not i = sqrt(-1)!!!
It would be more crazy if he threw derivative on e^x
Sorry can't get the references I dosed off in math mid season never got the chance to finish the seires
I WISH I actually understood all that math (I'm 14)
Please, animation vs biology
You should do Animation vs Lego!
The best class ever
is this what your math lessons look like?
Animator vs Chemistry please
The best thing I've seen till date
Определённо, это то, чего мы не заслужили, но то, в чем нуждались.

You make me want to go to school this is AMAZING
Who knew math could make you cry but in a different way.
Wait. The animation?? The directing? The sounds??? The music?? The MATH??? THe way everything falls together so perfectly like ???? This is amazing I can't imagine how long this must have taken WOW.
wtf was at the end!!??

THE BEST MOVIE OF THE DECADE
real math lore
Huh😅
Im wordless now
I learned math more from this video than in school.
So beatyfull!!!
I will surely come here after years to have a delightful piece of history that its gonna become and eat it with my iota spoon that my uncertain future will provide.
Wtffff
Отличная анимация! Хорошо потрудились!
Animation vs History?????
My favorite video !! 😊😊 Really Nice animation 😮😮
Make another part
We liked this one.
Hacked the server of my brain because it's so amazing
bro be learning math faster then math itself
Worst part about it is i understood most of it
It's really fabulous watching this as a math student.
School ❌ Alan becker ✅
خار و مادر ریاضیات
Bro there should be q game based on this fr fr
This is art. ❤
As a person that loves math, this was a blessing to watch Maybe this could be shown in schools because it would be a really fun way to learn math
это выглядит очень интересно, но из меня плохой знаток математики, так что я нифига не понял. Пойду теперь смотреть разбор У Wild Mathing
even I, who don't understand math, immediately understood because I saw this video🤓🤓
Bro, el aleph al final es muy bonito 😭
When you understand, what happens in this animation, it becomes much better. Love it
THIS! is The Best clip I have watched this year 🥹  Thank you Alan
Г хаха ды
This taught me better than math class
someone should make a game of this
this man is a genius
By the time the new episode of animation vs animator, there are a lot of people waiting, including me
When He Reloads   R=💯   🔥🔥🔥
bro found the guy who bought all the bananas in the math book and learned
Je compte sur toi 🐧
ah yes finally all that maths is gonna be used somewhere
This is absolutely amazing. One of the best math animation ive seen. Just incredible.
This is the coolest film I've ever seen!!!!!!!
This is why maths is fun!
I still didn't understand if it was a cartoon, a math lesson, or anything else...
This video made me want to learn math😊
When e^i*pi got angry. 10:01

Absolutely magnificent 🤌
Leave it to Alan to make math interesting!
I bet that orange dude is asian.

Es la mejor manera de explicar lo que teóricamente es complejo.
0:10 New achiement: The fist number.  0:18 New achiement: A new age.  1:00 New achiement: 1 to 100  1:10 New achiement: Another way  1:24 New achiement: Minus is here  1:31 New achiement: Zero... This is like my life.  1:40 New achiement: An interesting friend.  2:16 New achiement: (-) + (-) = +  2:24 New achiement: double it and give it a next person. Actually triple it.  2:36 New achiement: divide into two/four transactions completed.  2:48 New achiement: The First bug
Please do a part 2, concerning more math concepts. Maybe expand this to other subjects like biology and physics, where everything begins from atoms.
Please make Animation with Spider man as main hero.🔥
How to play calculator (level easy):
Insane..math really complicated ,can  understand by real mathematician...the complex of this video really matters how good you are in math..
I'm asking this seriously: is there any way to get this into a theater before the end of the year so it can be submitted to the Oscars?
Alan cada vez mais nos provando que é uma lenda!👏
My whole chapter of complex numbers has been revised!
Such a creative and awesome video! The explanation, the comedy. This should 100% be shown to students.
This feels like matrix or something the background the music feels like a movie or a very awesome video game this is the coolest one so far.
nice
My brain is dead
Have you guys ever thought of sending this to your math teachers?
my god
SC just gets stuck in a calculator casually
This animation is amazing :)
i understood almost everything until he pulled out the pi
wow
I don’t know math to that extent but if it’s all an actual thing put into an animation fight scene then it’s really time consuming and dedicated. Good job. Too be honest I glossed over it because I thought it wasn’t going to be that good until I saw a short of it.
Part-2 button--------------------------->
He made math interesting
This is basically the second coming going through grades 1-12
WOW
스케일 개쩌네
E be like wahhhhhh e is a baby funny sound
Wow

This video can exppain whole school math program to all classes from 1st to last
never thouht i would like math
When you get past your math knowledge and now can finally just enjoy it
It's  the best animation in the history of animation
next episode: "animation vs meth"
I think math just got a bit to far
what a great video, thanks
"Math is easy" math: 9:46
this man is instine
Can you make a part 2?
can you please make an animation of ballons td battles vs.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dude, how long did this take you!? The math references, the choreography, the cinematography, the flawless animation... I could go on. This is really, really good.
AVA shots ep.2
This is amazing! but I hate math😂
wow this is cool
Where the fight begans.... 7:19
"Oohh 1=1. This is so cool" *10 minutes later* *starts doing euler's formula*
Congraaaats!!! Is a Master Piece for the world Alan. THANK YOUª!
Animation vs physics pleeeeeeeeeease
incredibles
I never miss your video.
That was the best animation I've seen in 2023, keep it up Alan!
You Is God
💀.
I challenge you do physics
Dear Alan, if you don't mind, I'll ask my math teacher to show this on lessons for the pupils :_D
Good vidio
quick mafs
Khan academy if it was interesting
❤❤❤❤❤😈😈😈😈😈👿👿👿👿💔💔💔💔🖤🖤🖤🖤🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎💟💜💜💜💜💙💙💙💙💙💜💚💚💚💚💚💛💛💛💯💯💯🧡🧡🧡🧡❤❤❤
Alan becker share part 2 pls pls
Ah yes, other best alan animation
日本人いる？
And they say math isn't cool.🙄
Una carta de amor a las matemáticas
Have they seen the new icon yet?

When people says they hate math, it's always because they don't understand it.
Please make a metal slug next time
I stopped understanding what was happening after he divided by 0 but still pretty cool stuff
Genius
Cant even express what I just saw
. _. .
Что-то на научном 🧐
The video got too complicated for me near the middle 😅
new trigonometry video
es arte
Now I love math❤❤❤❤
こんな風に数学を学習できるVRゲームがあったら楽しいだろうな
His talent to understand is higher than Ramanujan😂
Now this is how you use maths in real life situatuions   this is beautiful
Incredible! I had to watch this twice since it was so epic!
Can someone explain the ending?
where orange go
❤
Wow, he is genius in animation
This is "Cute"!
Чисто лютая математика
Best animation video in the world
이 영상의 배경음악을 알고 싶습니다.
Awesome part.... create 2nd part of this...with new formulas and other mathematics equations....❤❤✌️👍👍
Can you please make animation vs  the alphabet please 🙏
Master Piece
Euler's number really had a constant presence here.
how the hell did he animate this 7:06
Explanation comming when?
Aleph Null, Or Is It? *vsauce music start playing*
The shortest 14mins in my life.. I can watch this all day
🤓
Why e(iπ) is too angry?? 🤔 Use of  ∞ was ultimate in function. 🤣
Can you make "ANIMATION VS SCIENCE" please 🥺🥺🥺
I have NEVER thought about being THAT fascinated by math.  What an amazing animation. I cant see math as the same  anymore after this video 🙌  Hands down one of the best videos on YouTube
Mükemmel Ötesi. İnanılmaz. UNBELİEVABLE.
Bro you know math very very good. I saw it from video. And also second+coming is good at math. Very good vide0.
Amazing!
If you didnt understand what you just saw, just multiply it with 0 duh.
alan becker is doing another episode of notes block
Just yesterday i learned about synesthesia. If the math in this video is correct (I mean it probably obviously is) then I'm guessing whoever did the maths for this has synesthesia. Otherwise, I mean, how do you come up with the idea of how to animate math equation and it still looks amazing instead of instantly sending people like me to sleep
This is truly a piece of art!
İm finally here to get my place on this legendary video ever
Better action than most of the marvels movies :D
At 7:15 it says "I sin"
You probably earned more views in Facebook than what you have earned here in youtube. Sadly though, I think you won't see a penny from there
Eeeee😊
Next animator vs chemistry
ya
This story is bad and good
perfect circle how
Wow, that was pretty cool, no idea what any of that meant though lmao
Sconce game are basically just math this mean the this universe of math hosts the most powerfuff characters of the entire franchise  The sheer potential lore is insane  just mange these weapons being used and nullefing all other weapons of a game
Wow loved❤
Any math lover here 😀😀
WOUAWE ET WAT
Parent's walk to class:
My Brian just disconnectted
The Mathrix
Bro jus animated my whole math.  Grade 1 - grade 9
こうゆうのを出して勉強したいお願いします何回かこの動画出してください
Animation vs animator s2 e2
You are amazing man
does Alan knows math?
Que maravilla de video
He could of ended the whole place by diving 0 and 0
13:39 where aleph shows up
bro built a transformer in math symbols 🙃
8:22 is my continued
Kesinlikle mükemmel
I learned more math in this video than in my entire time at school
This taught me more than my algebra 2 teacher
What does my mom think I can do if I'm good at math:
Tremenda obra maestra, ojala nos explicaran así las matemáticas en las escuelas e institutos. Estoy por crearme multicuentas para darle like. Me ha fascinado
...
i didnt know math could be cool
Bro when you make this im CERTEN my dude use calculator
Please, Please do another line of plushies I beg of you! P.s. AMAZING VID
I tried to understand all the math problems in the video while I was in 5th grade (it was pretty simple at first but then ...)
🔥🔥🔥
some more see pls
Cool I like it🤺
I love how tsc is just doing math equations all for only to catch an e
Favorite subject fr
Me trying to figure out that first math test question
I learnt math from this video
This ABSOLUTELY BLEW my brain! Not the math though, but the effort that was put into this video. Keep up with this great work guys, this is fricking AWESOME!
well, math is cool now.
A MASTERPIECE
when animator and mathematician  comes together
you dont see creative stuff like this normally , you did great job
youtube just peaked.
WAHH!!!
Frick, Stickmen are better than 90% of us in math.
Оооо, я его в детстве смотрел
¡Fuaaaaaaá!
90% of things I couldn't understand
Bro turned from 1 to complete algebra
I might have actually understood math if this was how i was taught it in school
:) vraiment tres cool, j ai aimé, tres bonne imagination
who said bollywood industry is more talented than youtubers......literally this is masterpiece🤩......marvel try to beat this🔥
Hi alen i am your biggest fan and i love your videos so much keep up the good work
Did this man work as an engineer in nasa?
Part 2 please
THE video is so cool
Where a number P?
Actually I'm not good at math but this video is enjoyable.
Oh sure can
was that Aleph roaming in the outro
Maths can be the best friend in world which will give more happiness than real friend❤
By now I definitely watched this video at least (e^π - π) times
Wow. This is so beautiful.
that was... complex... even beyond someone who wanted to be a future engineer (didn't make the bar)
Please let's create animation vs physics or animation vs chemistry. I think it will be awsome.
i cant help but notice the aleph null
Incredible
this is genius and one of the best youtube vids i've ever seen!
this is another reason why i hate math
NOW! Maths looks ssoo easy dude!!:)
The insane amount of effort that was put into this video blows me away. I mean all the flashing lights, the math equations done perfectly. All of it makes this a masterpiece. Well done alan, and i mean it, well done.
❤️❤️❤️❤️👍 beautiful 💝
This is the coolest thing I've seen in a while
Plase part 2
Very well made and highly entertaining... And at the same time, it reminds me of how every action movie seems to use the city environment and architecture only as a backdrop for car chases and fight scenes... But amazed about the result, nonetheless.
bruh how did he make that youtube video that was awsome
the way math was portrayed in this blank empty space makes me feel like that the further advancement in math can be the greatest asset or key to help us understand our world and everything in the universe.
Wanted episode 2 please
Part 2 please 🙏
ₑiπ
Waited for sqrt(i). Disappointed.
Legendary 😍
ive learned more here than ive ever learned in school
bro you are living leend
College math be like💀:
speechless... this animation is done to perfection
i need vietnamese
Tommorrow is my backlog maths exam .. think im gonna pass this time
This made me learn maths 10times better than schools.😂
hey thanks alan. i somewhat know how to do algreba now and my brain in exploded from all that starting from a number 1 . Thanks
Bro made math cool
Did you just calculate how to go into the multiverse?
if our math teacher do this i must listen her lesson
brain on the line
make something with chemistry cuz i hate math
mind-blowing,,, Love It.. but next time want Animation  vs Chemistry ..
Only if highschool math teachers make math this interesting
It felt like I'm witnessing Creation of whole Damn World.
Bro used Greek letters for english math.I didn't know that was possible because they are different languages
Remember when we all thought this was gonna be baldies basics and then Alan came up with this masterpiece?
That's why don't mess with Maths. 👍👌🔥😂
It'd be funny if someone made this all on a desmos graphing calculator
Math is fun. isn't it?
Imagination is the only limit 🤩
Why am I learning
It's a genial!!!
My brain stopped braining
This, is brilliant.
THE NORMAL MATHS TEACHER BE LIKE.............
i never felt any real growth going from school to college to uni. until now. understanding all of this without needing another video made me feel smart.
Oh yes all this happens from a calculator's pov
Bro invented his own calculator 💀
Just 16 million wiews in 9 days ? There is a wierdness.the coolest,funniest math telling I have ever seen .Being nerd has never been such cool 🤓
Now we want a craft video on physics  👇
As a great person at math i have to agree this animation has my head hurting about the different type of things in math with the letters and weird symbols and other stuff i havent seen in math
"Hey have you watched AVM?" "Yeah i watched animation vs minecraft-" "No not animation vs minecraft" "What?" "I am talking about animation vs math" "..."
math has never been this funny
this is a master piece
Super cool 🔥
asdw
Easd
wha
power of exponential 🤣🤣...it can travel another dimension with the help of i
increible se imaginan un juego asi de locos
Có ai vn ko
Мне очень понравилось видео! Хоть я и не понимал 90 процентов что происходило, но очень понравилось. Абсолютно заслуженно 16 миллионов за 9 дней
aleph-0 lol
7:20 Hahahahahahaha!!!!!!! look at e! 7:21 streched e?!
For the first time in my life, I enjoyed maths.
Niubi
5:48    1?
It`s been almost 10 years when I first watched your video on my aunt`s Windows XP ... you`re absolutely mesmerizing since. :-)
This is the best animation ever as it explains all of math in 14 minutes which schools do for 14 years!
very nice
A mi la verdad me gusta la matemática, y al ver este video, fue uno de los mejores que he visto. A medida que vas viendo cómo el stickman va usando más números y símbolos matemáticos, te das cuenta como se resuelve cada cosa, e incluso podés ver cosas más avanzadas.(Y me sorprendio también cuando apareció la "i" (Número imaginario), que eso fue lo último que había visto en matemática.  (Alan, no creo que hables español, pero si puedes traducirlo sería genial. Ah, y tú nombre es igual al de mi hermano 😃.)
PLEASE DO A PART 2.
MATH IS MATH
I mean like if someone would have shown me maths like this. I would have enjoyed it soooo much. MAN i really really appreciate the work. IT IS SUPER GREAT <3
PLEASE [PT.2]
I was not able to understand a lot of things in this but especially the last bit after the stick figure went inside the circle. Can anyone care to explain please!
Pov : im using caculator for nothing :)
Euler celebrating  in the corner!
Ive created a few animarions in my day... all i could think about is how f'n long this must have taken.  Amazing....
😁数学很有趣，能不能把这个视频搬到b站呢
@nihongomantappu
Ahhh! This is too good!! Great efforts. Great thought. Truly amazing!
Absolutely brilliant
Well orange is going to love math after this video
Wow!
i lliek banana
Masterful! I'd pay for more!
i laik this vedio
glad to see math found it way ...
I learned all the math from IT 😉
This animations reminds me of Portal so much.i dont know why
kh hiểu gi nma xem cuốn phết :D
Can someone explain the ending to me? Just the part after they became friends, i got lost. What was the gamma function doing?
Maldita seja a matemática.....
:stickorange_yay:
It's just so cool , as a maths lover and enthusiast, I can't resist myself from sharing it everywhere...❤❤❤❤
Studied applied mathematics like 7 years ago. Now I want to revise it again to understand all the Easter eggs!!!
Euler's formula really is the final boss of mathematics. Shows up everywhere.
The legend
awesome work man .......big fan.
Well i like when it screams
Why is it that the e number always try to run away when discovered?
thank you 😊
the beauty of this cannot be described by words.
bao
None of this made any sense to me. But I enjoy
Who said math is boring.
π cos sin
Now you understand that mathematicians are not just nerds and dig, but faceless warriors fighting against an unknown enemy with their own weapons
AMAZING
As a fellow math hater i am thourgly impressed and wished schools did sonething like this to teach us
Master piece
Can you make a version with Tau?
I'm so curious about the א (aleph)
Let's just call it the video of the year.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOMAGAAAH
my calculator history
Math is the language of the universe. If you can control math, you control the universe. At least in this universe.
amazing mathh fightt, now i like mathhh
you lost me at calculus XD
After i watch this i started to like math
Bkws
Why did the second coming fight with e?
wow.
I love math
My brain hurts
:O
Math Wars Episode 1, revenge of Euler.
I was so in to it and it was amazing!!! Awesome mf job! Subscribed!
Wooooooooooooooooooow oo
I had to watch a few videos that explained the more advanced stuff, but once I did, it got even more awesome.  I'll never look at -1 the same way again.  Genius work!
Bro I barely know trigonometric hyperbolics, trigonometric inverses, and trigonometric hyperbolic inverses, along with some logarithmic and exponentials and a tiny bit of series. Meanwhile you put my whole engineering curriculum for the next 4 years in a 14 min video
If this is a game and the only thing needed to create a weapon is to input an equation,
Please animator vs animation part 2 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
amazing
you should make a serious epic movie
I’m still so confused as to why the first -1 ran away at 1:47
Some guy: Alan is an animator Another Guy: No Alan is a mathematician Alan:
Very cool
Equal?
Why is this so good?
Amazing video.
the sound effects are exquisite
beautiful.
i learnt more from this then math class
Proved :- Math is a language.
This legit be teaching me more faster, and more efficient than a actually school. 💀
This is the most weirdest coolest video I had ever seen
I understood everything untill 1:44
r u genius or something? this is awesome
someone make this a game
This is one of the incredible videos that I see ever❤❤❤
This Animation IS Fire  People Who Agree 👇
Do animation vs biology or science!
What cant this man animate?
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮it's amazing 😮😮
I learned more from this video than I did from my whole sophomore math class.
SO AMAZING THIS BETTER BE A NEW SERIS LIKE ANIMATION VS MINECRAFT (but i dont think it would),I LOVE THIS AND IM SO CONFUSED WHEN THE ORENGE STICKMAN TURNED FROM SOLVING 1+1 TO WHATEVER THIS IS!,AND + (see what i did there😏) BRO TURNED MATH INTO FREAKING ART THIS IS SO INTENCE AND ONCE AGAIN AMAZING! THIS BREAKING MY BRAIN SO MUCH (bro really solved the 3rd question for the second note book in baldies basics)
I didn’t understand the ending. 😭can someone do a break down video?
Jesus christ, this deserves an award, most youtubers would just get lazy and say "SUBSCRIBE FOR PART 2!!!" This is awsome, keep up the great work. (but first take a break, I bet this took forever)
This is awesome
Finally alan becker upload new video 😭
dude woke up and randomly decides to own YouTube for a week
in some unfathomable way, you've ACTUALLY made math interesting, this animation was made by God.
que cosa mas increible
Now what were those last symbols? I assume something similar to i being an imaginary number do to impossible calculations
Boring math concepts from school are presented in an interesting and vivid way in this video. Looking forward to more videos like this.
Dad:E Child:e
that stick man is so smart smarter than the boy in my class
actually this is one of the best video for how to learn math for childern
When he pressed down on the equals sign I felt that.
How to turn complex maths in something really funny
This one was kinda boring go back to making minecraft
U will create new character?
I hope that the next dimension TSC ends up in is the Music Dimension.  That way, we can have Animation vs Music next.
“You know is not the same as it was as it was as it was”
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
The true Masterpiece
Great video
Holyyyyy!!! Mind-blowing!
Quien diria q las matemáticas no son divertidas xd
There's no any damn doubt that's the best iconic video in YouTube
simplesmente incrivel
This is seriously awesome. Something about the lack of dialogue makes it feel so purely mathematical. Anyway, would love to see the stick man get trapped in a geometry world next!! ❤
blud said bet to the people who said the second coming is dumb cuz doesn't have brain💀
When the animator is a mathematician 😄
WTFFFFFFFFFF
what was that again?
He's learning
God retired after seeing this animation, that was SO PHENOMENAL!
Yo tratando de resolver el problema matemático: mi profesor a los sinco segundos llenando la pizarra 😅
PLS    ALAN   BLOX  FRUITI  PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
now this is a MASTERPIECE
How it feels to take a math exam
I love math
Cual es la integral del minuto 9 que parece un robot, y anula los disparos del infinito? Veo que saca el limite, tiene algún nombre especial esa integral o función?
bro became a master of math in just 14 min
@Alan becker  It would be cool if you made a fighting game with the characters from your animations , with maps that reference the animations , with each character with their own characteristic abilities , it 's just an idea OBVIOUSLY
It's hard to put it into words, but the whole concept of using math to your advantage in a sort of "Baba Is You" style makes this whole video amazing.  I don't even know if i can make the joke about "this taught me more than my actual school class did" because of that fact; you actually have to understand EVERY concept in this video to understand the WHY of everything going on.
Only Alan Becker could take something like stickfigures and mathematics and use them to create an amazing video of a stick figure learning and literally fighting math. Funny enough I'm actually taking a math class this summer and this has definitely made math more interesting for me.
You did it !!!!! Another classic !!!! Congratulations 🫶🏽
I still can't understand this☠️☠️
This music is my favorite
He did things there that i don't even understand
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Воу. Это - Вау
Hay lắm chứ bộ
wow
eiπ?
epic
Man, this really inspires me to learn deeply about math. It shows your large aspect of knowledge and I definitely want to be that intelligent! Love your production, keep on doing your amazing stuffs.
My head hurts
Lejendario 😱😱😱
Another masterpiece is born.
What in God's name did I just watch? I lost the plot when he started graphing imaginary numbers... or whatever that was 5:20
Math ko ese samjhao ki 4 lo bole ki "rehne do mujhe nhi samajh naaa"😂
This video is sooo amazing, thank you for making it and showing that maths can be fun! 😃😊
e IPI is unreal
alan your stickmen are terrorists they always just go in and destroy the random beings living their lives i love it
The two nerds with different answers be like…
if I had seen it before I would have loved math 🤣
Do an animation vs physics next. I can already see the perfection in it.
This is just beautiful. It's been 5 days since I first saw it and it's still so mesmerizing 😍
why is this so popular
I had a stroke trying to watch this
Even YouTube wrote something
I always knew Math was evil
this is an awesome act with such minimal details every thing has its purpose and all equations have meaning that high level of being  nerd and an animator at the same time .  i have never seen any thing like this in my life .
the brain of a NASA engineer when calculating rocket launches (use google translate because i don't know how to speak english)
Wow I learnt so much math from that
can someone please explain why aleph is in the end
Best ways to learn math
This is funny
I just love that the orange being wants to go to the white realm, the imaginary realm and he is trap in the real realm
Gua sudah ketemu sudah ketemu semua angkanya bang
Bang lanjuk kan ep 2 wanted animator vs animation bang
4:22 why is e to the power of i times pi minus pi is e to the poewr of zero? can anyone explain
broh... like, honestly, how?????
This is the best thing I have seen all year.
Wtf is happening
Hey Alan are all of the stick people men?
All I could think of watching this is, I am a constructive mathematician 😎
Genial!
Best video 👍👍👍👍👍👍
45 %
😢😮😅😂 awesome
As someone with only quite literal basic knowledge of maths, I have no idea what is all means or why the letter e attacked our orange friend, but it still was an amazing animation
What an incredible video. 🤩🤩 I love it
My head hurts lol
As someone who can understand 90% of what equations are going on on-screen...holy crap this is amazing! Kudos for all of the effort put into this!
Wow, I’m proud I understood (almost) everything math related
wow
I understand just the begining math after this i didnt understand anything hut cool and is this e tricked orange?and gg?
YT removed you from my sub list... Again...
😂
This teaches me more about math than math class
I just cannot imagine what would happen if the guy would introduce *SET THEORY* into the animation...
That is cool Man
when i saw i i thought he was gonna flip it and make ! and show factorials
Love your videos so so so much!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What i see in your video is how god created the universe in a logical mathematical base
I love you, I never knew some random 5 stickmans could make me so happy.
do u believe in magic? bc now u do :)
الدافور ضد الرياضيات
POV: When the math teacher tells you to explain your work
yoooo it's the legend
MAN THIS WAS THE VIDEO THAT I MOST DIDNT UNDERSTAND IN MY LIFE LIKE I DONT KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT e whit the pi i tried to do the same math as the stick man and it did get TO e
o unico jeito de fazer geral se interessar por matematica é esse
man speedran the counting principle
J’adore
bro when I give birth to a kid I'm gonna give them this video and ask them to explain every part of it lmaoo
It's fkng amazing!
Thank you. For a long time I didn't like math. Now, after this awesome animation, I want to buy a shotgun. It looks super cool. Thank you again ❤
This is the most amazing thing I've seen so far.
I loved this so much!!!!!!!
I've never seen anything so mathematically accurate while also entertaining.. This man is definitely an animator as well as an engineer.
Alan Becker I love all your videos and one thing or two things when are you going to make part 2 of the new series and on your gaming channel I want you to play fall guys please is a good game❤
Holy moly, that's perfect
génius !
I don't understand any of this, but it's still cool
I love youuuuuu😍😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💯💯💯💯💯💯💯👍
Teacher: the test is easy! The Test:
Hi smart Orange
I am very good at math
É maravilhosa essa animação. Mais feliz ainda quem a entende. 😅
GOSTEI MUITO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Esto es una obra de arte, realmente le deberían dar un premio por tal semejante locura que acaba de crear. El simplemente echo de llegar a entender todo eso, de explicarlo  y de luego poder mostrarlo de una forma tan creativa es impresionante... llevar las matemáticas hasta su límite.
.     _.       .
Wow! Your intelligence and creativity are impressive  Like if you agree  👇
Son unos genios. Felicitaciones
kafam güzelşkn izleidm beynimi 100 de 100 kuallanabşkşiliyorum
What app does he use for animation? I want to learn. Somebody answer me plz 🙏
this is beautiful
Can you contact the videos where I want all the sticks pictures should be case by security toilet which is a hell no do you do that if you do that I’m not gonna be very cold and I
Maths - the international, universal, and cosmic language.
hey alan i now you might not see this but if you do im asking permission to do something kinda like you and the animations vs "something"  but instead of stick figures its more detailed so if you do see this please respond i don't want to be plagiarize you in any way i just want to make sure that you know im not trying to copy you -thank you Mason  ps: i do need your input thank you
스틱맨 두뇌회전 존나빠르누ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ

근데 어째서 저숫자를 주인공으로 선택했을까
ITS canon?
Epic like always, fantastic like it hase to be)
Ok but 2+2=5
I'm wondering about the reaction of some people who use the meme " another day without using cos or sin..." or "another day without using math" Bros math *sin /cos* is  everywhere you just don't notice😂
this is so much more entertaining than avatar 2
oh my god, wait what if instead of Animation vs. Math it could be, like, Math vs (Insert something here, maybe the alphabet lol)
Overwhelming. I love it
I didn't choose the Like Button. The Like Button chose me!
존나아름답다...
Imagine math being so easy😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
Unbelievably good. The Aleph in the end gave me goosebumps, it was a direct hit.
awesome work love it
Einstein would be proud after watching this❤
Commenting only after 9 days
e^iπ ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ아름다운수식
와 수벌 무기 부딫힐때마다 계산값나오는거 사소하지만 존나엄청난 디테일이다 존나쩐다
Благодаря этому видео я всё таки решил пойти в гуманитарный класс
This video might actually make me like math again
This video is hard for understending, but i a little understend this video.
씹.진작볼걸  조오오오온나 재밌다
Wow do this one ψ
44.244 comments. If you ever see this comment, here's an idea that just popped in my head : Would you like the idea of animation vs Sand tetris ? Could be really nice to see ngl !
Bro this is best
What if there was an interactive exhibit that was just like this?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing, creative work you put in your videos! Very enjoyable and astonishing! Always excites my mind non-stop! Keep up the awesome work! 👊😎✨✨✨✨✨
Wow
this is  masterpiece
This video made me realise how nerdge I am 😂
Es tremendamente estupendo el trabajo tanto en animación y en matemáticas. Es entretenido en ambos sentidos, simplemente increíble 👌🤓
This is so cool. I have always hated math because it didn’t make any sense to me. At least I can now appreciate what it truly is.
Bro got better at math than me in 14 minutes
please continue math part again and again ❤
Most people won't really get all the nuances. There are multiple levels here. Also, the music is spot on !
E l e g a n t e.  Ə
there is a mistake in the calculation at the 2:03 mark. It should be.....sike idk I'm dumb lol
much better than the infinity war from marvel :P
Bro literally summed up most of my engineering mathematics curriculum
I feel like Math class would be so much easier if they just taught us like this.
The sfx is simply stunning
just amazing ❤
This is SO appropriate for anybody who says they do NOT understand maths YET. Operative word=yet, curiosity is the best coach for teaching yourself anything. Yes, you can.. BRAVO for making this such a cool and fun video to watch....Hint: you might start this at youtube video double speed, but you're lucky if you can reach the end at normal speed....
Não entendi nada, porém achei emocionante.
There s no right words to describe this masterpiece
This is like watching the Mario movie for a gamer, with thousands of Easter eggs you see and enjoy but it's about maths for maths enthusiasts
been watching for over 5 years
Animation vs. Math
🫶🏻
why did it end with א
This is insanely good!
Added to YouTube’s Greatest.
Lore Accurate Math
One of the best videos I have ever watched on YouTube 😊.
I’m glad I finally know what sound e makes
I love how Orange keeps summoning new ones and chasing them despite knowing he'll have to fight them because he doesn't want to be alone in the void dimension
too bad i dont understand any of this
literally the only video uploaded on youtube in the past 5 years worth my time
Can U pls make the new episode from  (wanted) pls
Yo how tf!😮
This is insane 💕💕💕💕💕💕
que insano pa
1—8=0+9/4
bro is basically teaching us maths
Omg... Wow..?
Oh, wow! I just wanted to watch something random while eating lunch. But... well, I'll guess I'll have to reheat lunch again 😂
Bro,I think you’re a math wizard to do that! You’re mathemator😁
Just multiply it by 0
Bro I thought math was  was simple but when u saw this  pov me : 💀
14 years of math classes in 14 minutes
How does one even come up with this - this is a masterpiece
this is creative
wow
The fever dream you have before you Calc 2 final
Bhai animations toh ek no. the👌. Pr shuru ke 1 minute baad sb upar se gya🤕
This has to be your greatest vid ever
א
Me in 2024: How was this made 1 year ago!?
when will animator vs animation ep 2 come out
Strange, but I now 80% of these math and I only graduated from simple russian school
Beauty of Mathematics ❤
Awesome bhai
better than Thor: Love and Thunder
OMG so cleaver
What a thoughtfully video 🤯🤯🤯mind blowing too good
Damn that was good. Brought me right back to Uni-math-class :D
This is some God tier concept and animation💥
broooooooo that was awesome... i understood ever bit.
神作！！！我会推荐给我的所有同学观看！
The Death Star be like
Tower defense sim be like
This is magic. It is wonderful how you can make even math, an EPIC BATTLE
Bro smarter then my math teacher
Perfec animation segeres the skibidi toilet vs animations
the animation is so smooth that's satisfying
This is what i feel when math teacher taking class
Melhor aula de matematica da vida kakakaka
Even generations will remember, this is truly genius.
You lost me at 1+1
Help me to make like your animation  It is wonderful I think it is so hard
Thank god they are not alive in real life.
Finally math is fun, never thought it could happen
Alan explained an entire math just with 14 minutes video. I just skipped one year of school. Mad respect.
Really amazing
we need to protect this man, he can make a entertaining animation about freddy fazbear's feet
와 개쩐다 ㄹㅇ;
i have never seen something this tough and also this much entertaining also
Olmayan matematigimle videoyu izliyorum
Wow
Creativity level🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can anyone explain me what happened at the end
legendary
BRO YOU BLEW UP MY MIND IT WAS FANTASTIC!
😂, dyscalculique en PLS
A animação é melhor que eu na matemática kkkkkkkkkkkk
I want 1 more video on maths vs animation ➗️✖️➕️➖️🟰
Epic. ➕➖➗✖️
8=D bro
❤
so, learn to be strong
Божественно 👏
Multiplication
bad Examples
1+1=11👌
That mighty Aleph at the end waiting to be discovered is the greatest cameo of all time.
Wow this is incredible! Most of the time they never tell you what any of it means in school. This really gave me a sense of what all these terms and expressions actually represent, and when  see it laid out like that, its almost beautiful. You can see what mathematicians mean when they talk about the 'beauty of mathematics'.
amazing!!
I don't know anything after 1+1=2, but I know that this took a lot of calculation, animating and thinking to create this creative masterpiece that is truly one of a kind. I have never seen someone do something remotely close to this. Alan Becker and the people that helped create this amazing piece of video are geniuses
I really love your videos man i remember first time I watch you :D
Dude are you from earth or Alien ?
If math was this fun I would’ve had multiple engineering degrees 😢
The + End = x
Thanks you, I'm russian school children and I at 1st September 2023 year will go to school. I not know about √, and thanks what you not use a sankcies (idk how translate санкции)
Wowowowoowow
Teacher like this 🤣
my math teacher is going to faint when she sees these "equations"
I feel like i just saw Math come to life for the first time.  Almost as if the universe just unfolded in front of me.
Imagine making an actual game out of this. Where different attacks are based on different math concepts.   That would make for an incredible interactive educational tool in itself. Imagine if education was actually done like that.
wooooooooooooooooow
this was brilliant wish i could make animations like this. beautifully done. the music the sfx love this and knowledgeable
Definition of perfect video 😍
Incredible, the way to make such type of combination of maths with animation ,its show your thinking and effort on next level  👌
Wow imagine if math was actually taught like this.   Could you imagine how incredible this would be as a game, where different math concepts give you different abilities and attacks. Where your knowledge of math dictates your progression and abilities in the game.  An interactive game, where the more knoweldge of math concepts you have the better skilled you can get at the game. And you could have player vs player matches, almost like a math duel.   Imagine how engaging something like this could be if it was used in a classroom.  Imagine if education actually was done this way.
cool
And they said math can't be fun.
You had this aerospace engineer grinning like an idiot the entire time. Marvelously done!
You should do Animation vs art next.
s
Excuse me, do you have 2 channels? I found the channel ' Alan Becker clip' that use the same profile as yours and post your videos.
even he said one pice gear 5 lufi is nothing compared to the complexity of its mathematical calculations
Tamare, Alan, haciéndome pensar
you should do animation vs katamari
Avm is back
You're making math look fun!?
Albert Einstein missed this
Nice work
My Favourite Subject Before Watch  Math - 76% Geography - 84%  My Favourite Subject After Watch  Math 97% Geography 61%
Bro speedran all math in 14 minutes
Do part 2 pls 🙏
this should be shown in schools to get kids more interested in learning math
more
This was totally awesome
Was wondering how it got 14 million views in just nine days. And holy hell, the amount of details and quality animation put into it is just astounding. I only know barely about maths, but seeing how they interact in the coolest way possible and then understanding how they work.  It's just incredible.  One of the best YouTube videos I've watch ever.

Wow
Power of maths over physics
Part 2 pls plllllllllls
1+9999999999947474756+?
so is this why i gotta study math
you just blew everyones mind!!! love it
Sound design is the unsung hero. So satisfying!
Si asi fuera el gameplay de las matematicas, a todos les gustaria ir a la escuela
This is just a Christopher Nolan movie
Why i can't double like it?
whats happened in the end? i dont understand it. is this a giant?
Pov: Your teacher is albert einstein
Omg, you're back Ɛ> ▲
I just had a mathgasm
Aleph as a giant will always be funny to me 😂
Did I just see a Stickman become smarter than me in maths within a few minutes?
thanks for this beautiful piece of heaven thats why i love math <3 from iran
# RAMANUJAN god of maths ❤ 🇮🇳
All it takes is the second coming learning how to program and we're all dead
isn't i x i x i = i^3 in which i^3 = -i?
3:51 and onward: I have no clue what any of this means
it's so beautiful this video..............
Really hope there will be more of these ones! ❤
What a beauty you've created dude excellent
No one hates this i promise
This is far beyond AMAZING!!!! The though of every weapon being a formula and everytime he added or removed a variable it became a different one is just brilliant.... Can't say enough about this video.
nerd wars
bom
ANIMATION VS PROGRAMMING NEXT!
that was the most creative animation i've ever witnessed
why does this feel so much like alphabet lore everything was literally perfect up to the calculations and animation this is genius
1st time i am liking math
Now i need more
where there goes my 19 years of study in vain😅
most epic fight with actual story that includes math
Thunderous, shrieking applause
DOCTOR STRANGE VIBES🔥
My brain not braining
What's the background song name ???
Oooooo  I liked make more for this videos ❤❤
The way i didnt see alpha 😦
so satisfying
I loved 😅❤❤ Please l need more

tsc don't need power, he made the power
next time try chemistry and bio
Who is this genius?
1+1=0
It was a great animation video and half the math i did not understand
This guy is outstanding
Bro it is underrated 😢😢
how
Oddly satisfying
We need a video game about this
Kids after watching this: 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
e^(iπ) + 1 = 0
my guy was playing cookie clicker at the start
Show ❤
Maybe in the future Alan may do Animation vs Music is as extensive as mathematics
This is brilliant!
when you dont understand it but you can really relate to it
4=4+I have a nice evening my love and care for me please when please send your account is still in bed and breakfast for you and I don't have any other idea of what I 7 6xyek a little while NOOOOOOOOOOO ago I am was just checking on you to come back from the other day that you are welcome to my place to work stay strong for the me to come get me wrong I will call he was going to the hospital for check up on you for your the best only have the money for the first one to is your I will be bdp I will call you later when you get the best for you and your family and work with on your phone number for more details about you and your mom and dad are not going to be able a little great time with your family is doing great and thanks again and again and again and again and again I don't
Its perfect, i hope there is will be another vids like this
alan can you be my math teacher next year lmao (jk)
This is mathematically cannon
Animation vs. Math = 👁👄👁                      🧠  👉💥💥💥💥💥💥
Incredible
Minha mente assistindo esse vídeo: 😦😧😨🤨😐
This is fantastic! The sound design and the way you animate the numbers and symbols are so satisfying to listen to and watch. And God, this gives me so much nostalgia. It feels like I'm watching one of Vihart's Doodling in Math Class videos in middle school again. Amazing video!
amazing!
Watching your video after may be 2 3 years feels good to be bqck
Can you do Animation vs chess by any chance?
Best Animation ever ❤. These Best part was when He use 10x scope to Increase the radius 😊.
At 1:00 minute straight, Orange hits 100
Это прсто ШЕДЕВР!!!!!!!!!!! (This is just a MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!)
teacher: "you will use math all the time in real life" the way I used math in real life:
Alan Becker is the only guy who can turn math into an action movie
this taught me more than highschool ever will
I know algebra 😎
03/07/2023 Time 22.05 GMT wonderfull...unexplained by word...only Math💖
Bro should design math curriculum for schools.
What a joke, 1+1 is obviously 2763.
I,m telling my teacher to stop being a teacher so I can be a teacher
perfect
Alan should be my math teacher
Dummmm tu tummmmmmm um dunnnn du tunnnnn dummmmm
so good!!!!!!!!!
Best video in 2023 so far
The best action movie
alen is the best animator on the planet
-1=i x i
4:33
Why can’t my school play this to make me learn math?
I might be stupid in math but just perhaps because of this video I might want to study abit more about math
I learned more about math in these 14 minutes than I did in my years in school
that was totallly awesome
Your creativity is insane! I love this so much!
so basically i should've been paying attention in math class...
the best battle animation scene i ever seen so far
Absolutely incredible
My too😊
Bro broke a math
Alan Becker love math sososossososo
I love this video
So entertaining to watch this character discover the foundations of mathematics
Youtube is u i look a Youtube
Wait for that one nerd to make all the calculations to come to this
Average maths exam be like
What a beautiful!!!
do animation vs meth
my brain is starting to hurt THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
When are you gonna make episode 2 of animator vs animation VI
watching this thing made me realise just how much there is to maths and it just makes me want to learn each aspect of it
I'm in love
I JUST FOUND OUT IT FIRST BATTLE WAS NO WEAPONS THEN THE SECOND BATTLE IT WAS MEDEVIAL WEAPONS THEN THIRD BATTLE IT WAS TODAYS WEAPONS AND THE FOURTH BATTLE WAS FUTURISTIC WEAPONS
.
I don't understand anything
Legend
What 2:55
this is nice short movie!
I should not watch this in front of my parents. Cause they'll ask me the meaning of every single form there is. And i don't know any of it. Except the number plus, minus, times, divide.. just basic kindergarden math
please make second part
This is what peope in the past thought the future would be like.
Bro .. More mathematical animation...       This videos is best of all.... Bro. ..
This video shows all those years that i went to school was absolutely meaninglessness and Alan/ a stickfigure  taught me better
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The Second Coming Portal?
e
send him to another dimension\
As a person who loves math and enjoys it, all I can say is this is a "MASTERPIECE " and "PURE ART & SCIENCE "  I wish I could studied math at university to understand all these duels and battles.  So, to everyone one who sees my comment and he's good in math and a youtuber, pleaseeeeeeee make a video that explains this video and don't forget to mention me❤
😅
I can't stop watching this  Absolutely beautiful
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
taught me math better than school❤❤
The Second Coming vs Math
I hate maths but this is my favorite now 😊
WTH
Best video ever
This dude has such creativity
انا من العرب هل أحد يعرف مصر 🇪🇬🇪🇬. انا مستواي سي جدا في الرياضه واريد التعلم او اخد كورسات رياضه
This is far the most impressive thing i've ever seen!!!😳 So incredibly mathematically accurate while also strangely entertaining.
Bro doing math better than me trying th find a parameter of 10
bro pls make a movie
This is absolutely amazing! The concept overall is fantastic, but also the animation quality and music are incredible! -- Seriously well done!!
Now I love math-
a new subscriber, woow. this was brilliant!
Едбж
you one of the few people who carried our childhood
Omg i can't keep up with this!😱😱
This what we call art
Orange broke the canon event....   It's a new Multiverse: The Math Verse.
Bro this is beatiful animation
4:16 -cos(π)-isin(π) not -cos(π)+isin(π) 😅
That was so cool omg
The best thing i have seen all day.
Best animations ever
THIS IS GONNA VIRAL
11:05 BFG😂
Misi numpang lemwat
I am an undegraduate student of Mathematics and i really cried watching this masterpiece, thank you very much for allowed me to remember how beautiful math can be and for getting me inspiration to keep following my dreams. It reaaly meant a lot to me, i can't express how grateful i really am. THANK YOU!!!!!!! I LOVE YOU ALAN BECKER.
Part 2 😮
많고 많은 수학 영상 중 이게 원탑이다
Believe it or not... I have never thought of "YouTube " having  a channel named "YouTube " which actually exists..😂😂 What an idiot I am...!!!
Bro explained it better than my math teacher 💀
Brow, it's perfect
Peak. Flawless
Así tendríamos que aprender Matemáticas 😂XD
Is it weird that I learned something?
I DEMAND A FULL MOVIE, N(O^²)W(!×4).
...Animation vs. Science...
If math was like this I would be more motivated
Very nice story
I always knew Math was the Final Boss
Wait... The Giant Letter in the end is א?
Maths of 1000 centuries in one video😂😂
You confuse me, you know?
hypnotizing..
Allan Becker, the man who made math cool
Can someone ask a mathematician if this calculations are correct?
10:09 perfect drive
Really nice Animation vs Math is a Good Idea
Made some concepts for pt 2
This video is amazing in SO MANY ways!  Even though I've hated math since I was a kid, it's bizarre how this hooks you. I called my brother who is a physicist to react together and he explained parts of what he understood, we were talking all last night about meta language, artistic bias and how animation made all these operations come alive!  Next year I will graduate in animation, today I already practice parts of theory as a Motion Designer, I started my studies 6 years ago shortly after I see your video talking about the 12 principles of animation, but even before at the age of 14, my love for this art already gave me the certainty that I would follow something in the area!
How you use math in the real world
Math is ruined for me because of my teachers and my school and seeing this makes me sad.
pov: 12 year old me seeing letters in math for the first time
what are those things in the last part
Espectacular 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
How it feels when your introduced to Letters in math.
dulu saya paling lama setiap kali sudah simbol- Cos, Sin ... π ... √ dan lainnya muncul, tapi ternyata sangat menakjubkan jika bisa memahami mereka dan wow banget jika para stikman memunculkan infinity ❤️❤️❤️ sehat selalu untuk kak Alan dan Crw, juga para stikman yg imut ❤️
An amazing animation, hope to see work like this in the future. First time I ever experienced this, thank you for making this mate! And edit here, this is really accurate based on mathematics and it blew my mind!

Bravo pour le travail j'adore ce que tu fais ❤
This is so AWESOME
I hope this is an interactive games to teach math, I "probably" understand math more Orange will be back smarter than yellow
where is  0/0
And that N thing
Yep, i know it math is scary
Bro what was that e thing
3:49 I think we  all had the same reaction the day we first came across this, xD. Followed by a slight feeling of dread.
awesome.. luv it..
now this is what the fourth matrix movie should’ve look like!
Сюжет если бы он использовал !10
Lol xd
Ok ok the fact that this is educational as fu- be crazy
WOW it's been years and still don't know how to animate
what a great guy
Ngl I’m so confused on what’s happening lol
1 + 1 is bigger 1
"Do you know what's cooler than magic??? MATH!" 🤓 -Peter Parker
Bro! That is so cool!!! BUTTTT. There is a wrong formula, True is: -e^iπ=-cos(π)-isin(π) Thank for you listening. 😢
I never thought I'd learn math in an animated video, especially one by Alan 8:44 Mathematics is like that, full of problems and when you solve them, nothing is understood.
I really love thiss❤❤
Just multiply it by 0
As a math student this video so fk amazing
My first favourite subject was math
This 14 min video contains maths which I studied in my whole life
Animating maths is a super power now.
I dont understand maths but way you created it i felt like you are not human!!! I literally got goosebumps mate, YOU ARE REALLY SOME TRUE MEANING OF SUPER-INTELLIGENCE 😭😭❣️❣️❣️
This was so so sooo good!
This was unbelievably satisfying. The interpretation of the animated math was really beautiful❤
незнаю почему но для меня это напоминает портал
WOW 👌 Yes math my favorite lessons ❤
This is too damn good. Almost forgot me forget that i hate math
Я и алгебра
Decades later, Alan still uploading animations... ✨
This really shows us that math is infinite
Me brainstorming in math class😂
It's wonderful
Это просто восхитительно, особенно когда сумма взяла в руки интеграл, а если бы он был ещё и по замкнутому контуру, то было юы мощно, а ещё в конче очень не хватает преобразования Фурье и Лапласа.  Если честно, я очарован этим шедевром, и жду продолжения, и надеюсь оно будет!
존나 멋있다
This looks awesome! You just presented math in a new way. I want to start learning math now! Thank you!
mom: our son will be a mathematician dad: no he will be an animator son:
math lore
Wow I used to be an old fan of you years ago i stopped watching because I grew up
So many numbers to draw and calculate must be hard😅
This is the most interesting animation I've ever seen in my life.
Wow, and there I was just thinking Alan Becker could be more creative
This is full fledged math revision ❤
I used to complain that math is never used in real life. I stopped complaining after watching this 💀
i information the world of cam can have it
even tsc knows math better than me just learning about it in 14 minutes and 2 seconds. and yet idk how to basic math or advanced math
NOW THIS IS an entertaining math!
編集お疲れ様(今回もクオリティ高い)
Hope to see more of this, perhaps all 5 of them? maybe?
never in my life i would thought that math can be made into an awsome action packed fight
B I G
I'm also study maths like this in my mind.❤ So,thats why I'm a topper of my whole school😎
Привет PWGood
I love math
I think a math game like this would be good, a sort of sandbox math game where you start with "1" and you play around, experiment and discover all the rest.  Maybe with a logbook that keeps track of the discoveries, like "1=1" or "2 is (1+1)", but it only gets added when you actually find out, maybe by clicking and dragging a number to expand it  I.E: 1+1=2, but you can't use the two in the sum yet until you expand the 2 to show that it's just (1+1) or something like that.
This is masterpiece ❤
that's genius
Amazing
11:40 BIG BOOM
The new action animation
?
Alan  Pleace make game use its animation
The team just using 101% of the IQ to do all of this holy f-😳😯
Đỉnh quá đi.
This is what Asians do in their every day life
We want more of this 🔥🔥🤯🤯
I always thought maths was boaring but I must say now that I really like maths😅
*when a stickman learns math faster than you:*
2:02
when they taught us math like this, did we not learn it?😅
Living math . I enjoyed the accuracy plus the animation. BTW I missed the derivatives in the video 😅
I learned from this video more than at school
i love math 🤓
So this is the guy who made math,Hmm wheres your location?🙂
Reminds me of that nature and math video
There is nothing more beautiful
Your mathematics is soo good❤
great video!!
My new favourite anime
Alan Becker does crazy things again.
This is too perfect!
Keep your math kids
Now I am using calculator to solve this 😅
I know math but.. wow it’s amazing to see it so clearly 😮
Make more movies like this bro I love the action seen was very 😂😂😂😂😂funny and good nice educational video❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤love from india ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Epic Animation
Only genius will understand the video
That seem smart
❤❤❤
I like the fact that the arrows of the bow, that TSC made of 2, + and = is a 4
😊1+1=2. 7+7+7=21
This is the best animation I've ever seen on YouTube.
Fantastic crash course!
Make a game based on this animation and the laws of mathematics presented     P.s, I don't know if you're paying me or not, I'm Russian and the magician will put it wrong
The best video I ever got on youtube  And also I am a math student and I would say that it is totally hilarious ❤❤
Maths teaches us that never give up .
Just the moment he use sin cos to make not straight lines
Extraordinary ❤❤❤
This is absolutely great!
Amazing !!
Amazing !!
This is not just animation. This scenario is more interesting than most of movies 👍👏👌
This is a bit of wonderfulness
Soo, in the end i concluded that... It'll take a lot of time to Defeat the chosen one
Alan can u make yellow green red cyan tsc drink the grimace shake
E felt like a decepticon who is partially a villain. The Orange guy was a mixture of John wick and Dr strange
beautiful
Uhztg
I think this is the first ever animation that made me love mathematics otherwise it would've been a nightmare, Thank You Alan.
A true work of art
ウーン。好きィ！  数学ってやっぱりね。武器になるね(いろんな意味で)❤ ΘωΘくるくるクルー
10:58 was epic 😂😂
1+1=2
Where blue red yellow and green
I didn't know.math is soo cool
This is the best thing on YouTube.

Who has came from mortal Insta Group❤
I have NO idea what is happening 😭
Math lore but being described in the best way!!
10:02 yaaa got me😂
I felt like it lasted 6 minutes
This is really really good omg.I didnt know math could be so interesting.Math is literally all around us.I wonder how accurate everything is
I need the physics version 😂😂
Wait what? Youtube commented?this leads me to so many questions!!
Maybe do animation vs real life ?
Now I want to be a master in math to just understand those equations 😅😅😅.
First time I take intrest in math
i bet next year will  be animation vs physics itself
Bro 💀 8:50
7:05 bro wth
this is a piece of art
i want whole 2-3 hours of movie on this
this whole video really makes math make a lot more sense
part2?
out of all the things I would have never expected Alan Becker to make Math so interesting like oh my God
π this has made India 😂😮❤
I'll be able to come back to this video 4 years later and say, "Oh yeah, and those were the days I got stressed out over the square root of pi"
Man that was epic
If my teacher teaches me math like this l would loooooooove math like ti the core
i wonder if this could be a digital way to teach math, imagine how many episodes and series this could create !
my brain hurts
THIS ANIMATION WAS BANGER
Its so strange how this made me want to cry because - all my life all i wanted was to understand math because i know it is the key to seeing the universe itself. Somehow, this visualization gave me something of an insight and it was so wonderful. Thank you, for letting my inner child know that math may not always be understood in the traditional sense, but visually too. ❤
Bro could've teach an entire generation with this video💀
Wow😮❤️❤️❤️
This is stunning
Just made math lore interesting, please show this to kids in school and suddenly it will be interesting
I'm watching Stickman fight with the equation:
이것은 매우 쩝니다 제가 본것중에
Ghjkig
This makes me actually want to learn math
This was super deep man
3 mins in and i am already fucking lost man, math is hard!
Out of the world concept and execution!! Stunning.
Whole win in math orange or the worlds smartest kid in world
Soon we have physic, History, Geographic and Chemistry💀(MY OPINION)
如何讓數學課變得有趣
is that the aleph null number in the ending
Now make animation vs physics
This is so educational yet entertaining! *___*
Someone: "Math is boring"  Alan Becker:
You have to be Tony stark to Unterstand that whey are building. Such a level of math and engineering is way to high for me😂
Are you making it for chemistry or physics?🙏🙏 Please
WoooooooW
The best animation I ever seen.❤
what about Chemistry or Physics?
11:35 square root of -0 ????????
Bro, I got 1st place in math olympiad because of this video

This just makes me feel happy i dont know why 😌
bro after watching this I feel dumb but the video was really good
wow
From making simple and easy math to destroying a whole world with a giant circumfrance is pure wholesomness
watching this after taking eng courses was the best thing that happened in the past 2 weeks
Yeah, i'm interested a math
Hey you stop copying our Ishan  From Taarein zameen par  😂

I need Sequel Alan! Please!! Please this is awesome!
my badass
Much like when I enjoy smart space books like The Martian, I am completely entertained without really needing to understand the math/science behind it all XD (I have some vague recollections from high school Geometry and AP Calculus, but thaaat's it)
When I woke up today I did not expect to watch a stick figure get in a sword fight with e^(iπ)
1:41  e
this is beautiful

Pls post more wanted - animator vs animation!
That was actually amazing
Dang bro destroyed the imaginary plane 💀
Make this again this is so cool
I’m happy to be here to see history in the making, usually I’m a few years late lol ❤️‍🔥
I’m happy to be here to see history in the making❤️‍🔥

it's crazy how i can understand all of this but not the actual math lessons at school...
Man went full maths mode
wow
такого эпика с математикой я ещё не видел
I pity those students who says "I hate maths"
This is werry werry nice! :O
My brain is not braining
Epic!

Watching it for the 3rd time ❤ Edit: 4th time
This reminds me of Monument Valley, but math
Toda mi vida odiando las matematicas, creo que desperto una gran facinacion por este nuevo mundo❤ Siento que me abrio la mente y me siento menos ignorante
That was……. Amazing
Guys, wtf is e^iπ?
Learn math with the stickman.
So,  Alan's Math action > Avengers Endgame action
Why don't you teach math in this way, and many math haters will fall in love with math and praise you!!! Superb, maaan!!! I request you to come up with some math tutorials like this funny one someday.
I suggest you to show it to their friends
wow
This man somehow made math entertaining
math lore
imma try meth after this video, truly an amazing science
Wow wow wow... Just wow❤❤
My brain want to explode
me: how will i use math when i will get older- this man:
Annoying video for those who study
This man is definitely an animator as well as an *engineer*
GOD
Studying for a Calculus Exam be like:
ㅉ 유치하노ㅋ
i love avm!, i meant not minecraft.........                           but math >:D
probably the best animation ive ever seen. math.
It’s glorious

This is what happens when you expose a kid to tron legacy and the matrix
Animation vs math❌ Animation vs e✅
I expected for p-adic numbers will appear, but it won't. Anyway, You did really amazing! I love it! 😍😍😍
Bro made math entertaining lmao
how animators flex there math
Beautiful.
Bro, you are the Best, hippy night from cuba
Pythagoras is having a fucking breakdown
That is more than brilliant ! 👏 I bless God for such a talent 💫
I'm gonna show this to my students in class. They're gonna love it.
🎉 思想家弱爆了 The thinker is weak.
i know nothing about math, but this was awesome to watch
nossa  ate os matematicos tão de cara com video do alan ai mano muito bem feito nml
Me too
Can't wait for Animation vs American Revolution to come out💯
YouTube was made for this.
Upload on alan plays
wahhhh
yo it's so cool!
probably e i pi or whatever you call it is the worst alan enemy at math.
Next video  "Animation vs physics
Seeing that I keep getting a headache._.
History of Math in 14mins
"Bro mastered in mathematics Just for a video"
Understanders will understand
The whole e thing shooting numbers reminds me of calculator games
There's no way I understand all of this
This is confusing and cool at the same time
I used to think i knew math, now i fee like i need this to relearn some basics
Make this a netflix series already.
wish my math teacher would make this my final assignment "name everything going on here"
❤❤❤ yo you are my favorite youtuber
Hoolo
animasi ini lebih baik daripada film indosiar. wkakwak
King of youtube yes bro
Who want face reveal like please 😊
I feel like every animation like this should end not with “The End” but “And then Orange went back to Alan’s desktop”
it was osam
Alan is genious
WTF
my favorite subject was already math
I’ve finished geometry and I still don’t get this
Broooo this a piece of art
Yo The Second  Coming
Alan Becker's teacher must be proud this time😅

Genial, genial genial
A mi comentario solo darán likes los que saben y entienden las matemáticas, no quiero likes de gente bruta que no sabe ni en tiende las matemáticas
11:00 reminds me of a, 🎶Here comes the sun, do do do do, Here comes the sun🎶
I'm banks have to do this
I always sucked at !ash’s during high school…but has made me love it again
i love this homie keep it up much lov3
I found out about this channel from the movie it released, but now I'm proud of the beauty that this channel has turned into, thanks Alan
Its new concept, the way you animate, it should be a game. You should think about it.
I showed this to my 80 yr old dad and he got excited. It’s hard to impress him.
Aprendi mas aqui que en la escuela
Animation vs. Terraria? 🥺🎮🎮🎮
Mejor que dragon ball
uhmmmmm WHAT
i need a part 2 where the numbers declare war against orange and e
Amazing
Sensacional. Bravo!!!
That monster is what it feels like I face every time I do higher level math.
All from one.
kinda sad that how this very creative and smart videos are being less viewed than toilets with heads in them. they should be equal in views because there both legendary
Idk not understand most of this but that was cool asf
I won’t lie, there are a number of mathematical concepts I never fully understand until I watched this.  Brilliant work!
I hate math it's so hard.
Now I HAVE to see the fighting styles of all these other Math characters.
best video ever ngl
Studying MSc Mathematics. And this is a  freaking Masterpiece Sir💥
This is wonderful 😍
Bro fought math💀👺👹
My brain 😵‍💫
Before this video, anlan becker become tk a genious
This is the definition of Science x Math
Oi
I like how if youre not in full screen the the + end scene gives the white line some ambience
orange is a fucking mathematician in the making
que luta insana mano muito foda
Kinda feel like because e is alive and the other letters arent, the other letters should be.
The + End was probably the best way to end that.
Did I just witness an unimaginable  masterpiece

Animation has gone into a whole new level
So it ends with the anti life equation huh
make a movie on thiss...pleaseeee
Boooriing...
Thank you for making me love stick figures and math again!
100000+100000=
to the person like me who imagine math this was sweat
Genius never in my life have i ever seen something like this and it all makes sense at the same time, you are a god. I have been watching animation vs for so many years now since i was in high school you you keep blowing my mind over and over then i keep asking myself how are you going to top this and you always do, you are talented and blessed.
Red learned math
Next, Animation Vs. Binary.  After that, Animation Vs. Coding.   Atleast I would love seeing that done somehow.  Oh and the obvious after coding, Vs. Bugs.

How to make math better By Alan Becker
Epic
this video Is just.. to good Man.
Now animation vs English lol
the way everything is visually explained to me  the way it plays with math and numbers in such cool ways that also shows what the math does  this is amazing
this is what it feels like to solve math problems as a math enjoyer
If math was explained like this in class, people would pay significantly more attention and grades would skyrocket.
Not A math person here, but before I even got down to the comments section, I could tell that there was a level where this all made sense. Definitely going to make time to watch the companion video that explains  what is going on with this video . Kudos to the minds of the creators for this  piece of art.
how long did it take you to animate this 😭 great job!
actually this helps me understand it a little more
I watch this during the premier on my pc acc that was not sign  in so coudnt chat so i was just Sitting there
m a t h a m a t i c a l l y a c c u r i t e f i g h t s c e n e s
Please next the wanted animation
Nah but he learning math faster than me
The Best Animation in my life
Finally no more f*cking Minecraft! I stopped watching this channel since Minecraft's day one here
I would had seen this atleast 5 times already ❤️

Me trying to understand how King Crimson works:
wow xd
nunca pense que las matematicas serian epicas
Awesome! Superb! Congrats.
Weird
Tbh he should do a terraria one cause its 2d and gonna make more sense
Masterpiece 😮🥶🤯
Esse vídeo me fez me interessar por matemática, parabéns
Wholesome, educational, entertaining, and filled with the classic Animation vs action I have come to love! Great episode!
This video taught me more about math than my school in several years
做的太棒了！！
I hate math and also, bro made the perfect circle unlike us
The chosen one has chosen math
THE CREATIVITY THAT THIS MAN HAS BROO
Alan, you are incredible and also a great part of my past and present, and I hope future.
Hey Alan do you mind doing like a animations vs battle cats series next because I loved the animation vs Minecraft and btw, keep up the good work
Can anyone explain what is the symbols in last scene im so dead curious
Congratulation. This is perfect!
Anyone gonna talk about the chapter names 😅
Its that easy
YOU ARE VERY TALENTED ALAN, I LOVED YOUR ANIMATION EVEN I AM NOT A MATHEMATICAL STUDENT:>
Its 2
Yes or no yes😊😊😊
Season 2 pls
Honestly, as someone who always hated math for how abstract it is, this kinda made me appreciate the power this technique holds, to be able to directly mess with concepts themselves.
Been using YouTube for years now. This is the best video I’ve seen and this first time ever posting a comment
Bang Bikin Animasi SUS Bang Pelisss!
Being Alan Becker I expected it but this has been one of the coolest animes I've seen❤
A little orange stick guy is smarter than me.
Man this is extremely amazing!👑❤️🧠
Y SO BEAUTIFUL. REPORTED FOR HYPNOTISM.
I never thought that a math video would entertain me so much.

:ooo
Creo que una solución más fácil para eliminar el rayo de la esfera gigante hubiese sido multiplicar todo por cero
I hope this becomes a series. This is so cool! I don’t understand any of the math, but it is awesome to watch! Keep up the good work, Alan!
I understood everything up to 4:23 then nothing after that (except the basics of imaginary numbers)
How math should be taught
Oh yeah, you know what's another stick figure thing this reminds me of? :p Hapland! XD It's like this giant puzzle thingie series, it was really cool. :p  (Of course there's Henry Stickman too, but that one's more fluid and expressive with voice acting and stuff, I was thinking of more primitive and speechless ones similar to this. :p).
Это просто топ  Алан Бекер ты топ
Listo para el examen 👍
This is incredible
Oh wow, is this the same person that did Animator vs. Animation? :O They still make stuff?! ._. Wow. :O That's like old flash, right? :? I wonder how long ago that first episode was...  Reminds me of Xiao Xiao too, I wonder whatever happened with a lot of these old flash creators. :p
This was incredible!
can you do more animation vs. math
Excelente contenido, divertido, atrapante y por lo que veo, matematicamente correcto. muchas felicitaciones  Excellent content, fun, engaging and from what I see, mathematically correct. congratulations
e this died  from orange secret portal 😊
I am thinking that you got bored to do all of these equation cause i am doing the fonction tan and sin and it was long so good job it was captivating
Hello i'm from indonesia
so Youtube is not that bad huh😂❤
give this creator a prize he really deserve it.
this is just beautiful :,c
This is incredible
If math was that cool i would not have forgot so much of it lol.
Math is awesome, I wish it was real.
10:45
Make Part 2!
Thank you Foreign
لو لأستاذ يشرح هكذا لكناء من لاول 😂😂
Never thought that I would be entertained in watching math
What about animations va physiqs
wow…the amount of detail on 4:54 this is incredible! the weapons they made were literally mathematically correct like the bow was made of 2 x 2 and it shot out 4’s that looked like arrows! Incredible Alan!
THIS ANIMATION IS SO EPIC! I remembered star wars in this lol
Through this video I learned what powers are mathematically
هذا الفيديو مثير للاعجاب ودقيق ويضهر قوه علم الرياضايات وسيطرته في عالمنا الحالي
I'm not able to look at math the same way again...
This must be the most exciting and awesome video I have seen on YouTube for years! 🤓
damn, it was like a movie 10/10
and thats how officially life started😂
The e can turn in Σ

this can teach math better than maths teachers, and keeps your attention to an extent that no math teacher can ever dream of
Bro made math look like it was DOOM Eternal!
students : "where in life will we be using our math knowledge?"  teacher :
All my nightmares are here 🤣
Самое захватывающее, что я видел в жизни!
This video taught me math better than school. Lol
Can you make a part 2 with all the colors including King and Purple vs Math? Including the Minecraft, The Animator, everything. A war against Math... or maybe make a 1 Hour video that includes all of your animation versus. Because a hacker is planning to destroy the real world... maybe.
now the world of mathematics seems super interesting to me
animation vs ai
So epic
the square root of -1 is not i; the square root of i is -1
Wow that was best video l see in my life very good you are best😊😊😢😢
Is this canon to the Animation vs animator series? If so, then is the ending here an explanation for the incredible powers of the orange guy in Animation vs Animator series?
Coisa linda!❤
bro this is sick
The legend has done it once again.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽
85% of people has seen it on tiktok first
Yes.
Alan becker , mis felicitaciones , 🎉🎉💯👏😎😯😲🤯

Muito bom !!!!!  Nice !!!!!!!
Alan Becker eres un crack al 100 % confirmado , amigo es que simplemente hermoso , una fidedigna carta de amor a las matemáticas
I'm still flabbergasted by whatever I just watched, damn man I'm speechless😧.
Por primera vez entendí una clase de matemáticas.
damn
I love the build up and sense of wonder and human ingenuity throughout ❤ Beautiful!
Zajebista robota
this is my favorite animation in the ava series already. it's just perfect. the music is so good. wow
Do you remember that is the orange stickman is the chosen one's return
Teachers want a math video to get them hyped for calculus then show them this
A 15 minute video made me learn more than an angry asshole teacher in 10 months
I've never been so entertained by mathematics.
I don't get what happened to the guy... could we get a play by play ? :)
Uuuuhhhhhhhhh............... i still don't get it... But it's cool video, thank you
Dude at this point you could do animation vs sandwich and id be more entertained than watching a triple A movie
My QI 0
love this so mich
I really wanna see this extend and become a series
10:02 goofyass scream
これは伸びるべき！！新しいのも作って欲しい！！！ This is awesome! I would like you to create a new one!

Suddenly we can see math from another point of view.
I like the way the dude scratched his head when he got to 6÷0... Now that's the point where the algorithm changed from the initial pattern... Kindly educate me please.🙂
Cool video Alan
When he made the giant math mech I internally screamed: not the integral!!
𝐈𝐦 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐤𝐞 𝐦𝐲 𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧
I would like to learn this math!
But why tho is [i×sin(π) = (e^(iπ) - e^(-iπ)) / (2i)]? Shouldn't it be [i×sin(π) = (e^(iπ) - e^(-iπ)) / 2]? Or is there a mistake on my end? At the end it doesn't matter for the example of -1. But as soon as you add a variable like [i×sin(π×x) = (e^(iπ×x) - e^(-iπ×x)) / 2] it would. 8:24
If math was like THIS, I would still like XD
The master has returned
Cool animation, I create this too
Wow
Flawless Math-Sterpiece. For the love of maths. Kudos. U made my day.
Its really fascinating to see maths at war, accurately and geniusly.
what is the big imaginary number sign at the end?
The most curious and mysterious vid I watched so far

bro made math so fricking intresting
Bravo 😊
Це неймовірно 💥 от би в школі так добре вчили математиці...
i love math🥸🤓🤡       👇 pls
part 2 pls
Genios
using math as a weapon! wouldve never ever thought of that
So cool! A welcome alternative to all these stick fight videos. Loving it!
Imagine a game where you could use math like this to fight.
🫡
Math isn’t fun Also math
I knew it was accurate in the begining, then as it became more "complex", I assumed it was accurate, and now I must confirm it is accurate until the end... What have you done?
Greatness of this 🤯!!
Simplemente Wow 🙀
Bro We Need a Sequel this is soo good
Amazing
Math is most powerful 💪
Video of the year
my adhd during finals:

Nice
They really did make weapons of maths destruction.
I always find it cringy when a person says " I am a creative person". But if this man said it, based on this, I'd say :" yes you are", fully believing it.
Uttare delightful .....i like
Amazing!
Wow I never saw maths in such details even though I had obtained good marks. I think I never understood it like this. Thanks for the video.
Im literally speechless
Watch it in 2x 😂😂😂

I think it's one of the best animations I've ever seen I don't know math but if all those numbers match up great job
I LOVE THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I love math now
The fact that i didnt know what the hell was happening during this whole video, and yet it was still entertaining should say something about this guys animations
how do you know all this calculus?
MATH on the SPACE
God damn it, perfect
My mind: 🤯
❤❤❤❤❤
WOW i would like to have a personnal teacher to beat all the secrets of this masterpiece. Every kids should see this video to know that maths are not boring !
math is scary like inflation in poland where bread costs 6 fucking zł
Perfeito
Please, as a Matematician we need a part 2
I have never seen anything like this ever. This is so beautiful and so accurate. Well done.

Se dan cuenta que este canal gana mas vistas que skibidi toilet??
This scene wont many people understand that why the imaginary realm started breaking and he acacepted his mistake its due to the fact that universe and nature laws are written in maths the methodological explainations so if you do any sneak peek or changes its a theory which disrupts the real realm and will become to nothing which all was explain in dr strange , antman , avengers and all movies , so just mind it nvr break the mathematical laws which all written for universe code because its a theory it can destroy each and every balance of realm and this part only knows to physicists and some math geeks bcoz its a combo of both subject 😅 so ig my exp. Here emds well . Hope you guys have a great horrifying dreams after this video that e^i∅ is after you 😁
Now I know why schools teach math
Loved your work... I just wanted to know how long did it took you to complete this 15 min video... Really impressed with you work
Make more plsssssss
It was terrifyingly accurate. I saw math come to life, it took me back to the time when I used to try and understand the meaning of all this. Also the story is great, very captivating and the music was excellent, kept the tension going. Overall it's a masterpiece 🤩
Hi am baldi welcome to my school house!
Make a part 2 pls
This kinda hurt my brain 😂 and proved why I’m more of an English person as opposed to a Math person.
Masterpeice! That was amazing!
Your work is so hard
As an engineer, this is so cool and accurate.
Man, I remember watching this dude's minecraft animation videos while I was in 5th grade. I remember I tried animation using power point and it really enjoyed me. After about 8 years, I'm now a freshman in software engineering and have made a couple of games. You definitely played a major role in putting me on this path. I just wanted to stop by and say thanks. It's good remembering the good old days :)
Numberphiles rioting rn
You have an art of education which you are expressing so lovingly loved your work bro ❤
You forgot to include E=mc²
I am so confused 🤔🤔
Congratulations for one of the most extraordinary pieces of art known to me
why did i felt emotional after watching bunch of equations
💥
Felt like a matrix
04:57 that's my limit
Who ever made this is a bloody genius , i was scared of maths no its haunting me up in my dreams 🥺😰 i seen this in insta . What a masterpiece and especially that e^i∅ was literally horrifying
I still have no idea what I just watched.
Everyone likes math after watching this
♥️♥️
Suffers from doing math*
I would love an explainaton to all of this, why certain equasions have an upper edge above others (i pressume they negate one another?)
HOW THIS IS LOOK SO FUN??!!
11:33 Geuss he broke reality which is he went to imaginary numbers
Okay the concept that using multiply symbol and numbers with it will increase his speed is such a dope concept! I mean thats like some sort of superpower you know. But its really dope idea.. like way toooo dope....
My brain hurts so bad
Even a stick man is better at math then me 😭😭

Now I want a rogue like platformer game with math weapons like this.
This math is difficult

bro litterly learned the whole math lore in 14 minutes. I have getting teached math for years and i still can't understand it.
Maths is interesting but now its more
Okay I don't really understand what happened but there's a sequel right?  Right???
That is so frickin cool. Can we introduce THIS VIDEO for analysis in school? Would help a lot with teaching math

After some time math stoped making sense for me but I enjoyed the whole animation..... That was extremely funnnnnnn💀💃
Maths now are really scary
everything starts with 1 but you start with a 5 million
Wooh 😅🎉
I still hate math but love your Animation 🥲
Когда отобрали телефон но у тебя есть калькулятор:
people stole your video and put it on tiktok
THE ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE
Simply ART.
This is so gold as my favourite subject ❤
amazing .
Masterpiece!
incredible. the performing arts should teach more abstract mathematical concepts to convey expression. wish i had that growing up. i’m not the best at math, but am in total awe over how universal it is. the performing arts should strive towards expanding language through the utilization of math. it would highlight a step towards linguistic dynamics and concepts. very nice work. whoever animated this sure knows their keyframes and production know-how. great sound. great weight distribution. love this.
Best
HOLA
Wheres orange?
6:50 i lost a few braincells from this
This is masterpiece
Never thought I would be seeing an animation of a stick man literally fighting math, but here I am. Awesome video Alan. I also love how the math gets more complex throughout the video
Sadly I can't understand it fully cuz I'm in only 5th grade. But in coming in 6th
This is the way Alan Becker shows how good he became after his teacher 10 yrs ago said to him that he'll never understand even the basic math.
We NEED a math teacher to react to this
bro this is just good as a movie i didn't wanted it to end enjoyed every bit of it
I watched this before my final math exam on june 24.i got an A+ 🤯
You taught entire math till bachelor's in 14 mins
수학 너무 어려워 보여 포기해야지😢
It's so good that it's bad...
Very good 👍
Thanks!

you know  we not need to commaet but.... WHAT DİD YOU DOOoo ?, I am watching you like 5 - 6 years maybe more but this video... I dont know man, I dont know. You change my opinions now I will make a game about numbers math a lot of thing, You give a perfect idea a game developer who pass him childhood with you. Just Forget What I said you, I LOVE YOU and YOUR VİDEOS
Math Teacher: the test won't be that hard  The test:
There are so many smart people here. I feel dumb
How to make kids like math :
Math Teachers Be Like:
чёткая презентация того, что случается со школьником изучающим математику, начиная с первого класса и вплоть до шараги...
WTF
This feels like something I'd watch in a theater. Totally amazing.
Wooooow...
it's good

Incredible, thanks for that.
Videos like this make maths more enjoyable and lovable🤩, maths is not tough..you should just know how to fight it properly😎, anyways GREAT VIDEO❤❤
thats cool men
11:02 it will be more powerful it is has infinity
*MATH is the language of the Universe*
bro im starting 8th grade (us 9th grade) this year and we only do simple letter calculations like x  + 5 = 11 or something dumb like 2x * (1 + 5x) = 3x + 7
Math is alr
🔥🔥zajebiste nic nie rozumiem 🔥🔥
I love math but that made me love it more but also it made me cry at the end
this is a masterpiece
I never fail a test with mathematics in it I love mathematics long ago
I always knew, there is something wrong with e.
Will it be a fight between ln and e?😳
Hey Alan pls name the clicking  sound you used during the math operation pls 🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
saputello dei miei stivali va a let
If my math paper was like this, I'd definetly study
this animation taught me more math than school ever will
soooooooo  cool

MARAVILLOSOOO
Being a JEE Aspirant from India it seems to me like I am seeing the real world of math that we have imagined from the childhood.
This is one of the greatest YouTube videos to ever exist😭
10!
Wow...😍😍
math has never been so fun to watch
Alan just wanted to flex his straight A’s in math
Awesome
0:13 yo escuchando al profesor 10:26 yo despues de distraerme por dos segundos XD
As someone who love maths from the bottom of the heart, this video is awesome 😍
13 ads in 14 minutes.... The video is cool but its impossible to watch it without get stop every 2 sec.
This is Awesome！！🥇
pls make animation vs. life bruh
Matematika mudah bukan? Bukan.

that's why i studied math, to understand what this video means
I love how SC just immediately resorts to violence
I want a game with math elements for abilities/world building inspired by this stuff. Never thought I'd come to appreciate the math I've survived through in university on a YouTube video.
How do you write this in a maths notebook?
ı love your videos
Absolutely Beautiful!!!
Desde hoy 2 julio 2023 me considero fan de matemáticas ojalá esto nos fueran enseñado 20 años atrás 😢 gracias me inspiraste frecuencia, energía y vibracion.
is this math valid
😍😍😍 I've always loved math!!!😍😍😍
Amazing!
Part 2 Please 🥹🥹🥹

Just amazing
They should make a maths game out of it🤔
This is gonna be school in the future
Create a Send Part Pls Bro....!!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻  Love From India
That was done really well.
bro this is so good
How mathematics came about be like:
Son zamanlarda izlediğim en etkileyici videolardan birisi oldu . Emeğine sağlık admin .
Com isso fica provado que a matemática é a melhor todas!
Yooo YouTube comment in your video
Hermoso
The best 👍👍👍
Woooooooooooow
That world is awesome
Oh no...         M E T H
Now imagine how long the author tried to understand what each symbol means, and checked that all calculations were correct.😱
Amazing!!!❤‍🩹❤❤❤
That cool
greatest jaw dropping animation i've ever seen, sht almost feels real omg what an animation
WE NEED SEASON 2
This is one of THE BEST thing I have ever watched on youtube.
The absolute masterpiece
Tomorrow is my math exam, thanks for the revision
im speak spanish im not speak english
my brain do 3 thing at same time when watch this wonderful video lmao
Beautiful!
THE BEST ANIMATION!!! Como siempre Alan sorprendiendo nos con este tipo de cosas e ideas que nadie nunca imagino
This. Is. Amazing.
Bro i didn't even know this much math existed and I'm still in school
I wish someone told me like this in schools
how to learn math in 14 minutes without school and university Greetings from Russia!
math has never been more interesting than this
Math teachers all over the world are probably rejoicing over having something this fun to show during class at some point.
Math is more complicated then it already is now😞
i didnt expect the video to be this good!  i really tought it was going to be a boring math video. This man can turn anything boring into a masterpiece
Bro singlehandedly made maths interesting 💀
This was inarguably the most beautiful thing that I have seen in the past few weeks. And I have watched plenty of movies and youtube videos during this period.
WhAt
10:01 😂😂🤣
wow this is amazing I feel like some teachers might show this to their students to teach them math. What kind of math is used here/when do people learn this stuff in school?
Me want episode 2
The only anime where analyzing and explaning the attacks and moves mid battle is actually important so audience like myself doesn't get lost.  Bravo to everyone involved in this project. Very cool way to visualize math and make it look cool.
Thinking calculator
mathematics is considered the most accurate among science but in my case, mathematics is my worst enemy
Mel this orange guy knows more math than I do😂
When is the next part 2
Just wow ,the level of creativity 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥, awesome

So much creativity, mind blown 🤩
Please new video pls pls plsssssssss
HELLO I FROM INDONESIA
It's feel like cinematic universe
I honestly believe this should win an oscar in some category.
Bro just make a deathstar using math

I needed more Parts of this
soooo good!
Si awesome

Another beautiful day of not using math past elementary school in my daily life.
this is why math is deadly
This video needs real appreciation...... I would request more videos like this
i dont know math but i do now just make a bow out of 2×2 and make a sword with +1 to defeat the "e"
Bro really looked at calculator and decided to make this banger 💀
And here I thought the answer was 42…
🎉🎉 i love math

原視頻找到了！
我是数学白痴😅
wanted - animator vs. animation video - ep 2 please
真·知识就是力量 REAL·Knowledge is power.
Im terrible at math but i know this is some advanced stuff great work
what makes these animations so incredible, is the ability to bring to life the fertile imagination that we all have sometimes, or have had as a child... It brings me immense nostalgia from childhood, when I used to make simple things like a keychain, become an infinity of things just with the power of imagination!!
Dude, this is the first time waves and parabolas have made any sort of sense. Your lead animator is a genius.
WOW!!!!
Hats off to the makers🔥🔥👏👏💘👌👌
Part 2 please😓❤️
Amazing work and imagination!!!! Make you think and appreciate more maths
My v favorite video
i didnt understood it, but i loved it
WOW! One of the best if not the best things ive seen on youtube. Thank you sooooo much. I will show it to all of my friends)))
You should do animation vs grimace
I've never seen anything so mathematically accurate while also entertaining.
This is legitimately how I see math in my head, and why I had an easier time with it growing up until I had to start dealing with concepts like imaginary numbers but this is magnificent. I checked the formulas and equations and all of them were not only accurate but depicted in animation in such creative and interesting ways.  Thank you so much for making this
🙌😳
Now every time I do math, I will think about Alan Becker.
This is iconic  🔥🔥🔥
We wait animation VS physics
My brain is hot
First of all it is amazing 😍🤩 It's an animation based on mathematics logic but I don't understand why e^iπ was running.why it's like the villan of the movie any one can help?
7:25 silver chariot
Bro i learned more things in here in just minutes but in school it takes years or months
amazing!
i have no words
I finally get it now
Is there anyone with me who also can't understand after:4:00😅😅😅
This was just pure creative genius
Terkoiz doesn't have any socials?
shout out to that guy who actually understand after 4:00
amazing
This is so good even youtube itself had to comment on it💀
개지리네 ㅅㅂ

I LOVE THIS !!!!!!
Alan! You never disappoint! Ive been watching your videos since the first animator vs animation and this is another amazing videos and showcase of your amazing skills! You sir are fantastic! Thanks for yet another amazing video!
Now we should know that Blue love Chemistry and the reason why he is *blue*???
All this was made from the number 1
this was more fun than all the years of math I went through
woaw
at 10 years old, i know lots of math equations until 4 minutes in then i know nothing about basicly 5 minutes in cuz i'm not supposed to know what =f(.) means. we all know different amounts of information, heres something that could change artificial intellegence forever: no one can have the same amount of information, it does not matter if youre 1 or 100, no organic matter or non organic cant have the same intellegence.
TheTheta
somehow reignited my interest for math
This is the best animation I have seen in my life, and I have no idea how this can ever be topped, simply fascinating.
Part2
is that real? math.. math is enjoyin?
Alan Becker when will the next video will come on minecraft
I only come back to this for music, its amazing!
Your animation is beyond imagination bro,the way you play with math and it's formula is amazing 🔥🔥 especially when you shot fire by increasing the radius from r=10 to 100 is amazing 🔥🔥🔥.keep it up bro
how do you can find this knowledge?
The + end = End (the = true)
I don't understand
The little things like using a negative sign to flip around makes me laugh
Quel chef d'oeuvre. Vraiment, un bijoux.
Alan becker's my fav video animationvsmath 😅😅
Math. Our greatest enemy we cannot sadly stand.
For the first time, I like math so much, but I still don't know how to understand it😂😂
This was all terkoiz's idea? Props to him! Very proud of how far he's come from Shock.

tip 1  Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies turn out best when baked one sheet at a time on middle oven rack.  tip 2  The best cookie sheets are shiny aluminum with a smooth surface and no sides. These cookie sheets reflect heat, which helps cookies to bake evenly and brown properly. Rimmed baking sheets will not provide the same results in cookie baking.  tip 3  For best results, measure ingredients accurately using the right measuring equipment for the ingredient being measured. Make sure to add ingredients in the order they are called for.  tip 4  The best way to measure flour for this Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe is to first stir the flour a bit before spooning into the measuring cup. Fill until heaping and then sweep the excess off the top with the flat edge of a butter knife.  tip 5  Line flat cookie sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Make sure to give the dropped dough plenty of air space so that the cookies won’t bump into each other as they spread.  tip 6  Baking science determines what makes a soft, chewy cookie versus a crisp, crunchy cookie. Factors that make a difference include the ratio and type of sugars used, the amount of butter or shortening used, and how much flour is stirred in.  tip 7  Use a 1-inch meat baller (or cookie/ice cream scoop) to make Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies that are uniform in shape and size.  tip 8  Want to make jumbo-size Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies? Use a measuring cup or cookie/ice cream scoop to scoop out cookie dough, dropping each scoop 3 inches apart. Bake until edges of cookies are set (centers will be soft).  tip 9  This Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe can be customized with endless flavor combinations. Just replace the chocolate chips and nuts with the same amount of the new ingredients you want to add. Try adding macadamia nuts and white vanilla baking chips, or pack a dou... More +  Nutrition  120 Calories, 6g Total Fat, 1g Protein, 16g Total Carbohydrate, 10g Sugars
This is an awesome animation along with the delightful music makes a really good and fantastic video who knew math could be presented like that!

I honestly think that something like this could be used as a format to inherently teach math.
10:45 the hammer of dawn has been made, math has been weaponised.
The amount of mathematical knowledge you need to even try to make this🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻💥💥
Dude i love your videos so much!!! I used to watch you before and i gotta say, you're just as good as you always were
Unbelievable Make an anime
THIS IS SO AMAZING!!
HMMMM A NEW SERIES?
You should make an interactive learning math tool from this! Why is no one making this? I would spent eternity learning math this way haha
Ain’t no way they made math interesting
That's so cool!
The Word EPIC still be less to describe the hardworking in this video.
Are the stretches on the numbers when he pulls them apart equal signs?
He make math more fun but I still hate math
To be honest that’s how math is fun XD
This is a math but very recommended
As always like from his AvM vids and the others, I can't deny to be amazed by this video - especially to the part that e^(i × π) literally wielded an integral sign as a weapon at 10:00  which truly made me feel enthusiastic since I'm a calculus student 🤩
The i x i = -1 scratch on the head is my favorite
eh guys can i have the name of the big black guy in the end of the clip pls
this guy need the oscar
Your the best
no words
10:35 Bro got a death star💀
This was so satisfying to watch and showed that numbers can be fun 😅❤.
Хоть она и сложная но я много чего нового узнал о математике из этого видео
우와
AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!
mid the vidio need full iq 😲😲
I’m gay
is this part of  math is powerful  for learn  if we're considering the Taylor series expansions for sin(x) and cos(x) around x = 0, they are as follows:  sin(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + ... cos(x) = 1 - x²/2! + x⁴/4! - x⁶/6! + ...  If we replace x with (x + π) in these expansions, we'd have to evaluate the series at (x + π) instead. It's also noteworthy that sin(x + π) = -sin(x) and cos(x + π) = -cos(x), which are simpler ways of representing these shifts without computing the entire series.  that really hard to write and seen it
🎉Fantabulous 🌟

If only I could fight with math then Math would actually be fun
Вот была бы такая игра...

13:45 aleph - 0 !!!!!
omg

Epic :D
If Orange does pi, The uhhhh thing would be cool.
That "uieee" at 10:02   was awesome
I understand for the fourth minute, nothing after that  -.-" (:( ....
this video is really good for learning math 👍
It's so weird at 6:50 seeing sin move along the x axis and cos going along the y axis because I'm so used to cosine being used for x and sine for y.
와 보고 감탄이 절로 나오네요!!!
Now, e is overpowered.
Having the power to bring the creativity and the idea to life is a great and blessed thing
i was about to say that alan should collab with 3blue1brown and then i JUST saw 3b1b's comment here lol
e^(i*π)
Really appreciate the detailing.
Oh my god the comment box has a lot of check marks
Mi God the" e " running and making noise how cute!!❤
Everytime brilliant ideas! Thanks!
the world will cry if math is alive and aggressive like this
State of the Art❤🎉
can we have like a second part of this this is f.... amazing !!!!
I love it❤
honestly if i was there i would be stuck there forever not knowing how to do math.
It's the coolest, greatest and greatest YouTube video I've ever seen!

Super 🤓
A very decent animation describing the world with mathematical precision. Thank you very much, Alan!
i allways feel very impressed by animations that alan does, please more!
The sound design of this is amazing! I've been watching Alan's animations for years, and they keep getting crazier and better, keep it up!
Janhzou pls alan becker

It's a good idea
never thought math can be used as weapon of mass distruction
what a nice video
This made me laugh so much. Imaginary numbers is amazing 🤣

круто марвл
It was nothing but a masterpiece! Never in my life i praised maths! It was my fearful subject! Never liked the subject no matter what! But after looking at this incredibly made piece of art I’m somewhere concerned about the interest I showed about mathematics! I guess it was me who didn’t dare to sit and give it a shot to understand how beautiful this subject really is…. Well it reminded me of my school days and also college where I struggled to fathom the concepts in math. I just graduated. We had maths in our initial four semesters. I kinda struggled there as well but my Intentions were to pass. Never thought of scoring.And I did. Didn’t score well in math but I tried to understand how to crack it down. Now I’m here. Stumbled upon this masterpiece and maybe it was worth the watch. Thanks Alan. Truly wonderful.
🤩🤩🤩 i love math
와...진짜 죽이네요...제가 좋아하는 유튜버가 영화는 아니지만 영화같은 애니메이션을 만드니 정말 기쁘네요🎉 앞으로도 재밌는 영상 올려주세요!•+×÷=
This is insanely satisfying
a legit movie
No one’s talking about the sound design. It’s soooo good
This is just awesome!!!!! Love your imagination and creativity of applying it like this!!!
I’m bad at Math but why I can understand this video 😬?
Animation You are so cool!
Sach me too bohot achi banata Hai
Bro​ made​ number​ 1​ across the​ 1​ verse
Literally my favorite video of the moment ❤
It's like "TAREIN ZAMEEN PAR"
Это было очень эпично!
He’s becoming smarter
Now I want to see a game with the same concept, so that mathematicians would play such a shooter, of course I will only watch, I'm not crazy)))  Теперь я хочу видеть игру с такой же концепцией , что бы математики играли в такой шутер , я естественно буду только смотреть, я же не псих)))
You are to big for this world
I wonder when will the stickfigures use mods 😯😲
*Daydreaming at math class be like
This is a masterpiece, imagine if someone made a game about this in VR about math, it makes it even more fun and educational. (Not the fights btw.)

Awasome
It is a piece of art, that need to be protected!
omg this is the best
you never disappoint me
I'm getting calculus ptsd
Ain't no way i love math by this 💀
hey i know there is a very high chance you'll say no but could you make it to where orange goes to the end AKA dimension -1 in minecraft
Taking rush e to a whole new level
Great job Alan becker it is amazing
I  l9ve your vidios i  the fan of u 😄😃
Bruh  that's very accurate math equalizations
Better than all movies from this year
we need that game... aka portal but with math xDD or just imagine scholars on math class playing vampires survival style based on that concept
Epicly spectacular
How to make math epic
this is just mind blowing!
This video reminds me how I used to love Meth in high school
My man has 10000 Q
whats 1+1?
So many hours for AMAZIONG THINGS :) Congratulation this is Brutal
Hu e=😂
The sound design tho
Wtf amazing 😍❤
What is meaning of end scene

To begin with, thank you for your awesome animation.. I am a student in South Korea. Because i love math so much, my youtube algorithm is full of math. I have just watched your masterpiece by accident.. I can find many details and process of math although I understand a few of them. I've been impressed.. I wish you would make more math animation.. Thank you..
Wow ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
😮
this video heavily screams dumb to me
Stickman would say: WTF What is 1=1?????😂👁️👄👁️
Cool
i never knew math and stick figures can make an awesome fight
YouTube not letting. Me tell them shut up
and that's how the chosen one became the smartest person in the multiverse
What is this? The utter creation of Devil Fruit?
8:23 pov: how war begun
what is the huge symbol shown at the end
bro explained all math in 14:00 minutes
Fantastic animation!
My full engineering mathematics was worth it
Wow , impressive & enjoyable.😮😊
Masterpiece 😭
do less drugs
Who wants NEW   'Animation vs. Math" LIKE this comment.   <3
omg it is very good animation and music 🤩🤩🤩
I feel like this could easily be content for a “reaction” video for a math channel. I guess a lot of this went over my head, even though I think I understood most of this. Amazing video, kudos!  Edit: right after commenting I saw your pinned comment to a reaction video😅
Please made video for pubg character vs your stickman 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 love from India
Is Orange figuring out multiverse traveling ?
I am a very curious guy and this video just made me think about many quetions anout math like whats the one thing mathmaticians cant solve or is there anything more then infinity and so on. I tried learning from this video but i just can't seem to understand. No im not a nerd, i am just very curious.
better animation than baruto
so cool
Почему так мало лайков?
One of the most creative intuitive ways of explaining maths I've ever seen! 3b1b and things like this are what makes math intuitive
I need more of this I loved it
Math teacher: i dont waste time for a stupid video Math teacher after watch: 😢😢😢
Everyone is talking about the animation, lets appreciate also how good is the sound effects.
졸라 명작이네
Bro just made the best combat game/storyline
You should make animation vs fightinggames
animation vs met-

best thing to show if i have kids
Waited so much for a vedio  But it is a master pice
wow, incredible:3
Greater math 😲
The math teacher was so moved that he almost cried
Math lore is crazy
I am really fascinated to see math coming to life. Am impressed with the accuracy and the genius behind this masterpiece. This is so far the best way to introduce newbies to mathematics and functions. it brings everything to reality. This will definitely serve as my intro to any student  taking math related units. Kudos to the creators of this timeless masterpiece.
it is perfect. everything right down to the last minute detail.
This is pure fiction
my childhood channel 😢 i was obsessed with tha cliff animations too
first one watching and WOOOOOOOOOW this was insane
این کانال چندین میلیون آدم دارد این کانال را دنبال می‌کند اما همه ویدیو ها فقد ۶۴۰ هزار لایک دارد
The math war
Who would win? SC with math or King Orange?
Gold loke
Why no one cares about the sad part😢
Better than many Hollywood movies ❤
Excellent
Wow just wow
wow alan becker has evolved since 2007 nicee
The best thing I've ever seen in my life, inspired me to study math in college and beyond
아 완벽하게 이해했어 (문과)

Wow! What A Smart StickMan!
It was very nice and educational
Please Do a part 2
This channel can't be more amazing
50×50=?
مرا به ذهنیاتم نزدیک کرد با اینکه تا آن حد ریاضیات را متوجه نشدم ولی نمایش ابعاد ریاضی گویای ذهنیاتم بود ، و این جذاب است ولی از طرف دیگر مایوس کننده است که اگر جواب همه این سوالات داده شده و این سوال ها مطرح شده و این همه زمان گذشته پس دسترسی ها کامل است و بیهوده است که من دنبال رسیدن به ابعاد جدیدی باشم چون بزرگان و آنهایی که پشت پرده نگهداری می‌کنند این علوم را ، حتماً خیلی پیشرفت کرده‌اند که بدست آوردن جواب سوالات ذهنیات من ، جواب قرن ها پیش آن‌هاست و تبعات ورود من به علم چه خواهد بود ؟ جواب این سوال را در آینده نزدیک خواهیم دید . و جواب انیمیشن جذاب آلن بیکر هم در همان زمان داده خواهد شد . ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If they taught me math like that at school, I would be an excellent student)))
those who know complex numbers will love this video
The God must be a mathematician.
BRUH THIS GUY EXPLAIN MATH BETTER THAN ALL MY TEACHER
Actually, it would be -0 instead of -1 because for -1 there must be 1-2
A masterpiece
MAGNIFICO!!! thats so accurately insane and the animations is smooth like a butter!🔥🔥
TSC Just called Yellow dumb in 50 different ways
10:02
😮👏👏👏👏👏👏
This have the entire hardwork of math master in the whole time
Todo lo que sale lo e estudiado y casi lo entiendo todo
Great video! Now do it in binary
bro damnnn
The best watch
Look, if you actually made a game that had weaponized math, I would learn complex numbers and cardinal infinities just so I could obliterate my enemies.
I learned more in this short video than in 10 years of school when it comes to math
It turned out very cool, I would like to see stickmen in the game People Playground, I think it would be cool
Adiós naranja 😢😭😥😭😥😭
so e^iπ = -1 = i x i x i         ?
In animation vs Minecraft the figures are 3-4 blocks tall, in Minecraft a block is a meter and here the stick is twice as big as 1 so 1 is 2 meters 🤓 Also this is pretty cool
Fight of decade
amazing
This is just beautiful
2
Это просто шедевр❤
All math in school problem for just 1 video
that was awesome
I can't learn maths like this 😮😮❤
Why does 1 + 1 = 2?
Genius??
An epic math test be like:
So creative man!! Loved this
orange learned more math than i can in 14 minutes
This man is very cool
Who is like cube
Как бы тогда выглядело сражение против физики?)
10/10
I don't get any of this 😭
Amazing
The aleph null at the end is amazing!!!!
The legend math ....
Great video, but a question: can anyone tell me the origin of the sound effect that plays 11:19-11:20?  I absolutely love it but I cannot source it (reminds me of the laser from the Big Bad of the Avatar Korra show)
This was really wonderful, an incredible work.  The animation was delightful, the music compelling, and the math concepts real & fascinating (if only my Math degree wasn't so old; maybe I would've understood more of it. xD)
What the
Your video is so cool alan becker👍🤩🤩🤩
Thank you ❤
Proud to say that studying complex numbers wasn't useless, infact I m proud to study
Truly an asian moment 🤌🤌
Your animation movies are very good because you are interested in learning math
Alanbecker i mist you
this is the best amazing and delightful video i have ever seen😯
my brain burning💀💀
MATH is beautiful ❤️
Never seen ever
🙌👏😌
Cuando se alcanza este nivel de maestría, vuelvo a recuperar la confianza en el género humano
As a person who learns math visually and intuitively, I think this how we should learn Math in the future.  I just realized that the world is not just physically beautiful but also abstractly beautiful.   To the artist, engineer and architect of the whole universe, you have my eternal gratitude for providing me a not just practical world but also beautiful.
I feel my head is big
thats why the math confuses me all the fucking time even when i study everything right, i just get more confused
That e is cute
Awesome!
I wish this video was released during my 10th boards I might have scored 99😅😅
I liked how he used animation to show the infinity world of maths...
I'm too stupid to understand this
I feel like te music in this video and the sound effects are really underappreciated...😢❤
I actually learned some math-
From Cid, one of Alan's biggest fans:  My brother said that this was an OK animation, and when he watched it for the first time, he found most of it interesting.
No words can describe the elegance of this masterpiece. Sehr elegant.
even Einstein would have to pause to understand the math
I understand everything yet I don't understand anything
I must be done my math class to solve the equation in this video
➗
why cant math teachers make math look this cool
➖
It's such a good video but I don't understand like 50% of the stuff
➕
1+1=1
as a person who is bad at math I can confirm that after 2 mins this video is too complex for my small brain
😲
is this why my math teacher says math is fun?
When you are so smart they make explanation videos for your animation video
That was math in a nutshell😂😂
Never has maths been so interesting to watch 😂
a good way of teaching math
I swear this is the best animation I've seen so far!! This is a delight to all the math lovers.
alan ur animations are like movies to me🤯keep it up
Nert🤓
14:02
12:32
Man that's my first vedio i have watched of your channel but from now I'm not gonna miss any of your vedio that's mid blowing super amazing
what creature was the last 4 following in the end? when you look closely theres some sort of titan.
9:30
If someone could create a game like this it would be fun
stick figures are becoming smart!
This video is the perfect amalgamation of Computer Science with Mathematics... Splendid visualization, its just so useful for students to clearly understand the concepts. 🧠More such content will be appreciated! Gracias!
How math teachers fight:
Who in here just watching not knowing what the hell going on after + and - number?😂
Yas
I think my favorite thing about the “Animation vs.” series is that, most of the time, both the stick figures and their opponents have the same toolsets and the victor is whoever can utilize that toolset better than the other.
EPIC 🔥🔥🔥
I am only a third grader 2:40 and 3:05 is kinda confusing
OH MAN, MY MIND-
Hello are you can talk polish? 😊😊
Bro…
This is why ai won't replace humans.
Nunca olvidare el animation vs minecraft😢.
My tiny braincells trying to comprehend what is happening: 💀
I miss OG stuff like that they should upload more😢
Wow this is just a masterpiece The way to show the math is just incredible
Send this to your maths teacher
Just when I think it can't get any more epic... he makes a new equation!
Is this real 👀🔥
If we have INFINITY i bet we have negative infinity ♾️
Now I wish l knew more math and be able to enjoy this piece of art even more deeply. This is breathtakingly accurate and deeply detailed.
How did you made audio for this
This is the best mata seen
wow
This animation is just a ploy to make us want to learn math
Damn that's amazing
e
Hard math
I love it.
As a 6th grader i know nothing after multiplication 😏
next animation: "animation vs among us" its a dead game but the colors of the stick figures are the colors of the among us guys. And in Animation vs minecraft original red turned on all of them as herobrine
Thank you you reminded me why I love math
Animation vs. Math❌ Animation - math✅
make part 2 pls
The fight scene was awesome and accurate if you look closely to the details.
Its amazing 😊
Masterpiece
You earn my respect🫡
I love the concept of this! Trying to find out the right equation to catch the e is such a cool concept!
from math to alphabets
i dont understand nothing
I’m going to 8th grade, but I learned 8th grade math in 7th so i know all non high school math, but it escalates in complexity very fast
14m views in a week? Nice!
As a college math student this made me very happy 😋. Great job
I skip math class so i dont lnow whats going on
Dude teaching a whole maths in one animation 😂😅
Impressive!!
Bro TSC went from addition and learning that 1+1+1=3 to destroying eternity with radians and infinite tan (0) s
0:35 Orange realizing that his head is a 0
600k likes are not enough for such a cool video🥰
Mathematicians have finally created something interesting after 3.5 million years.
The laser cannon was just the formula to find average while e^(i*[pi]) is literally eternity haha so much attention to detail, and the formula for the expanding cylinder
great
Craaazzzzzyyy!! I never could have imagined that math could be this BADASS!!!
This is how maths should be taught
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ The real math in real life in education.exe 😎
I’m happy they didn’t do  6 Sigma i = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 i = 3 Otherwise this would have been even more disastrous 😂
my brain hurts
Now I want to learn more math 😳
•
Bro this is so confusing
1 + 1 = 11
Me in 6th class *can't understand this all*
This video is incredible ❤😮

Hey Alan what happened to your minecraft world spirit away or something
you're math😇
The whole credit goes to whole team . 😊😊
1+1=11
I love the vid and it’s one of my top 3 favorites, but it might just be me I think this is part of ava series. Idk why but I just get that vibe from it
Wait... as I imagine it. I just realized that this could be what’s going on in TSC mind when he got paused. Any ideas?
wow, you actually made math really fun/cool
Nice👌
this is way not related but I'm wondering if you could try do a animation vs with Kirby,  it would kinda be funny but if you think about the lore then thats where you can get ideas otherwise other nintendo games would be cool.
I am so confused
Math is War 🔥🔥
If math were like this I would be having real fun. If anyone could make this in like vr would be great.
QUE VÍDEO PERFEITO
i completely dont understand what's going on but i really think this looks cool
Using a cool story to spark curiosity about math? This isn't just fun to watch, it's going to change lives.
And like the real math things get way too complicated way too fast
The Hell bro, your videos are so amazing that Even Youtube comments on it.  Keep doing this dude!
como eu começo as aulas de matemática do bimestre e como elas estão no final do mesmo bimestre
Dude what? This is actually amazing. Unbelievable..
i don't have any words for this
you lost me at 1:35
eso significa que el stick man naraja es un matematico profecional?
Damn I thought this would be one of those nerdy movies where they teach you about math
So creative!
if we ever get a Star Trek level simulator, I'm using this video as input for future generations to learn math
this video will be nostalgic
As someone who was forced by the system to take calculus three times over i must thank you for making me think math is cool again
While most of the mathematics here are beyond my understanding, the showmanship is still very enjoyable. Well done.
I think I learnt more about math watching this then every yaer in high school XD love the vid @alanbacker big thumbs to your animators to and the music loved it can I get a spotify
When TSC accidentally entered MathCAD
It's really amazing and quite accurate visulisation of mathematic symbols, wonderfully done!!
It's blown my mind ❤❤❤❤
Best math content i ever seen 👌
Love it
Dam, W creator :)
Animation with math a new matrix and actually equation.
This is absolutely beautiful, just imagine some animation about the Riemann hypothesis or the group theory, it would be completely awesome
Es increible la cantidad de conceptos matematicos involucrados en esta obra de arte
Even for me
Fantastic video wow you did it so nice unbelievable have no words  Very well . Liked it so much Dami
Naturally, it all starts with 1...
e^iπ is Etarnal.
No way
Make video on Pokemon
This is amazing! you took your talents and decided to do something educational. Great work!
SC really weaponized infinity, turned it into a orbital death star, and did all of that to go home. And he didnt even run into more abstract equations and math terms like aleph 💀
My brain hurts
This is genius. Absolutely brilliant 👏 👏 👏
My love
The fact that the math goes from easiest section of math to the hardest
Please, make a part II where the quartenions appear!
What my calculator sees when I get bored in math:

how to make math fun
Quiero que en tu próximo video se titule Animación vs Stick war:legacy

Now with this I will surely pass in my university
Esto lo hizo un profesor de matemáticas, hay partes que no entiendo ni madres we.  Para alguien que es conocedor del tema se le hara chido.  Para alguien que no conozca al 100% este tema dira que se la fumaron bien mojada.
If only math were this cool 😔
Nah i think you graduated from harvard or smth smh
Ni Marvel tiene esos efectos
Did bro just told me how to do math 😮
I learned math in a video
Can some smart person explain this animation to this math moron here? 😅 Mainly the (what appears to be) hate our orange guy have towards the "e"... I'm fascinated by this animation, but I understand basically nothing, lol
I am far too dumb to wrap my head around this 😅
Bro made the best stickman animation
6/2 = 3
卧槽，牛逼啊，跪着看完😱
Ini mtk bang
Orang is big brain
The way he catch the limit
I love meth so much...
Math made my brain hurt because of the letters and numbers. But this, makes me wanna learn the fun stuff about it more
شكلي وانا بتفرج ع أساس انه كرتون 🫠🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
math lore
all I know is 1+1
THIS MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE 💀
educational + peak entertainment? could- ask for +
This is so educational and entertaining, I'd compare it to a modern-day version of School House Rock! Cool choreography, the environment changes with the formula manipulation, and the DETAILS! Whenever the +1 and -1 hit each other at 4:44, a 0 flashed! He shot a 4 from a bow made from 2x2! The arcs used by the e and stick figure to get around were accurate representations of pi! I could go on, but there is just SO much stuff to write about I'd be here all night!  Hats off to you and your team again Alan Becker! My mom, who is a teacher, will probably use this to teach her class about mathematics!
haha funny number go pew pew
Solving math problems be like:
bro I don't need to see the spiderman movie if I have this
make more stuff like this because this is very good
Dude count using mind while i count using my finger 😭😭
i learnt more than my math teacher taught me for 5 years
Ajig mang hade pisan gugel ge nepika komen alus²
I've always had a fascination towards Mathematics. It's like a never ending game and I love playing it. People who don't like math (many people) are afraid of the calculation and complicated formulas that come along with it, but really haven't discovered that beautiful side of it. How each element is innovatively aligned with the other. How each expression can obtain different forms in different systems. It may sound kind of funny but I relate this to Multiverse like, different versions of one in different worlds (eg: The worlds of Complex Numbers, Trignometry, Matrices, Coordinate, etc). All I can finally say is, a big thanks to the creator of this beautiful art to explain the endlessly fascinating world of Mathematics.
So good!
Alan out here saving lives
Cómo revivir mi amor por las matemáticas en un sólo video:
It takes a special kind of person to create personalities with mathematics
How did l learn more in this video than nine years of math
What just happened
The man
This is why I have been wondering how math looks like. Even if I hate maths, im always interested. This what is the most amazing out of all.
Hey Alan Becked can you make animation vs physic
HERMOSOOOOOOO
11:10 beast go oblitirated
Lore
9:10 cool af
The next time orange gets into a fight have him call appointments math to beat the next enemy
math is crazy🤯🤯
This is seriously your best one! The sound design is amazing and the concept was extremely well executed!
quiet kid in math class: 8:29
Just wow
Que legal, agora eu sei que menos sei sobre matemática!
this remind me of my assignment  bro make us do math by watching
=f(•) is funny because how actually it shoots infinitely
Really amazing
I love how when all the math things make sense
Pls do animation vs roblox next
做這個真的超花腦和時間的，支持🎉🎉🎉
Orange with Math or the second coming
I will not accept another definition of art that is not referring to this
Quick question of the day   Whos is the new vilan in the new ava episode?  Is it victim???????
math's strongf\
blud made my math class easier

Animation VS IA???
uff that's wonderful, you could say that he won the oscar, part 2, right?
A melhor animação que eu já vi. Parabéns!
you could probably make a Free VR Game based off of this animation!
U broke my brain
10:02 bruh 🤣🤣🤣
1+1= 11 oc'lock
Oh no, my worst enemy... *mathematics*
this video is so creative and the story is smoothly organised. i love it
Anybody else keeping up? I lost track after 1 + 1.
So good
Green vs blue fight 😫🙏🙏💓😫🙏🙏💓😫🙏🙏💓😫🙏🙏💓
All my respect for creating this brilliant animation!! Marvelous in every sense!
🤯
This is how math being taught in far future
1+1=3,75
aw man, that music was creepy
He managed to make math hype, amazing
I’m blown away with this amazing animation. I was a math geek in school and I’m so happy that I remember most of function. Kudos to the creator 😍😍
top demais
No way youtube comented
Nerd
It would be a pleasure to meet you, you are a genius. I understood everything. Good job.
What is the meaning of the giant א in the end?
This is useful animation..
Hmm, I thought there would still be an equation.
the sound design for this is GOD TIER. absolutely puts hollywood and DC/Marvel to shame.
can't wait for higher math levels.
impressive !!!!
10:02 the yell💀
Hi, Alan!  My name is Zach.  I really like your videos.  Remember when you posted a teaser for the Wanted episode?  Are you going to do a teaser for episode 2?
Hi
So incredible i'm waiting for Part 2 🤍🤍🤍
Orange bullied math tho💀
What a beautiful video, truely
9:47 numberzilla
in the beginning he was testing the game mechanics
Best episode ever
Now showing Animation vs Subjects II: Science
This makes sense because when e^(i*π) goes in the door he is going into the negitive area of a graph
Tsc just learned math by himself!1!!1!!
Yaya I want the animation vs animation Ep 2 to come out because I really did not understand and great video alan😅
Dude, the audio design on this slaps so freaking hard
=f(•) is a machine gun now
Thank you for being my new math tutor!!!!
수학을 잘하려면 싸움을 잘해야한다.... 메모..
SIMPLY SPECTACULAR
For animation vs Math, we need a ally. *Computer Coding & Programming languages* vs Math
I never this this, stay more than 5min watching a math video, but this is clearly art, pure art. Amazing video. AMAZIIIIIIING!!!!!!!
I never thought I will be interested in a math animation 🙂 but no I still hate math,I love science❤
You really can turn everything into something fun as long as you have creativity
When will you release part two of Animator vs. Animation V?
12:10 BRO THIS IS ULTRA SUS
the soundtack gives me tron legacy vibes
@dateunvlog @dateunshort
easily i can watch this as a whole 2 hours movie in theater if it's available. thank you for make me more confused. haha
Quero aprender com tu em português
This is beyond Mathematical
This is so impressive, big respect🔥🔥
Make episode to of this where it has algebra like X=4 and A=2 So A+X=6 and X-A=2
epic
this animation is good to learn math for kids honestly
a lot of student in my country struggled so much with basic math, the first 4 minutes already cover most of their problem, thank you very much

This is seriously what teachers should show their students
Ellenbecker can you make make an AMA drift video from Ben 10
I don't understand anything of this. Math it's not my subject.
This animation makes me like math XD
What's he's doing
Masterpiece
Math is crazy bro
Even if i suck math and hate it this make feel its good
You know you have a great math teacher when they put this on the projector  (Orange fr said "BY THE POWER OF CHRIST I COMPEL YOU" 4:42)
I say you're kidding
Era bromita
3:51 sorry it stops at here for me
Tomorrow's mathematicians will say they fell in love with maths thanks to this video xD
kids with dyslexia:
Qual o nome dessa música de fundo? Posso usar em meus vídeos?
Increíblemente original y radicalmente bueno, felicitaciones por esta obra de arte pedagógica. Definitivamente el mejor vídeo matemático que he visto.
😮👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Cooooooool * 2 😮
the most beautiful thing i saw this year. i have no words to describe you nor this masterpiece. WOW.
This. Was. Awesome.
wow alan like the start of this chanel was incredible and still incredible
wowoowowowowo! This is insane man!!!! I loved each second I used to see this masterpiece, , amazing work!
I love this so much!!!! I've seen it a few times already!!
As a programmer and a math nerd I love every single one of the references in this one like how every time the greek E shot at the stick dude the value of n went up, I just loved all the little details so much XD made my brain super happy
I wish I understood a fraction of this video...
what is the littel symbals at the end
Enzyme Apocalypse- 3:19 - 8:17
Animation ww2 plis
Teacher: the test isn't gona be hard  The test :☠️☠️
Perfect
Bro the fight scenes were like amazing.
Alan's teaching me more math than my 5 grade teacher is.
Can't believe my least favourite subjet and my most favourite animator teamed up to make such masterpiece.
i will solve this equation pi-self
@veritasiumES
That is just magnificent!
I hate this my head hurts
To come up with the plot for this is an astounding feat
I like how they create different weapons just from using math
la identidad de euler anda re agresiva
Master class 😢😮😊
Dang .. cant even pause ...
as a maths nerd, i approve of this
I love the smoothness and the rising potential of math! Orange constant seeking exploration
Now this video knows every math problem.
The sheer creativity in this is mind melting
Oh le nombre de refs incroyables, c'est magnifique 🤩
Yesss another animation! And my favourite orange stick is back
Watched 6 times. Wow. I don't have words, it's beautiful. Amazing!
Imagine if teachers were to show this to new freshmen.  Math would become the favourite subject of everyone.
math vs stickman? AZAING BBBBRRROOO
진짜 천재다 라는 생각만드네요
I really like the style of this animation!
Video of the year! Fantastic! Thanks!
The amount of times I'm going to watch this is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...
The detail is INSANE.. Every single math equation was right, goddamn it not just that, the animation is GREAT, + the story, everything is perfect. GOOD JOB HOMIE!!

My brain hurts
everyone is talking about the animation and i can see why, but what abt the music man, it fits perfectly does anyone know where i can find more of these types of ambience songs
As an adventurer once said "Mathematical!"
¡Increible Alan!, todos los detalles escondidos del video como la entidad de euler, los numeros irracionales y mucho mas, se nota el trabajo y el esfuerzo👍👍👍
Ayo alan had a thing against math when he done the video
Now my brain hurts after i got to learn everything in this video
Just wow
Wow! Well played. WELL played!
Замечательно!
MY BRAIN IS NOT BRAINING AFTER WATCHING THIS
No entendí nada :D
This is absolutely fantastic, also I cannot understate how large of a role the soundtrack and sound design play in making it so good
i only undersand 1/10 of it but i love it 1 more than the 1/10
the kind of math that everyone will like
11:19 “thesecondcoming”CAR NOISES
wow this is good
😮bro learned math in 14 min😮
I wish my calc 1 knowledge was enough to understand this 😅
Animating with meth
im gonna show this to my teacher to show that its possible to learn math in 14 minutes
ÅsτθηisℏiηG!
I've always had loved math but now I have a wonder land of math. I mean he made 1 into i
você sabe q vc é nerd quando vc vê, gosta e ENTENDE esse video.
Numero 1 is waiting
My whole life was a lie As an electrical engineer and english teacher till 6:49, My mouth dropped. You have made a masterpiece!
subtitles: "waaaaaaaaa"  Thank you
all i got from this video was that e^i*pi and little orange man hate each other …
Mathematics is vast and infinite, beyond our capacity.
how did this man make maths interesting
Climatic mathematic masterpiece.
🤯🤯🤯
for next AvM, witherstorm
Jugaron a calculator el juego que describiro richard
This was like an action movie😮
yoo whats up with that square root of negative zero at 11:35

vid idea: aimation vs tiktok the Stickfigure's: orange & red
My guy made math cool
As a civil engineer you brought tears in my eye.... Wish this wound have stopped, you should think of the start of the universe, and the process it took till the present and make a long movie with the language of maths... As at the end everything is maths...
wish u added integrals too
My man made the Death Star whit math
MATH
i want it to be a video game
We HAVE to have a part 2 PLEASEE
the fact this came out a month or so after ANOTHER impressive animation is INCREDIBLE
Best animation on math I have ever seen with beautiful soundtrack complimenting the effects of equations.Great respect for the creators.
This is one of the best animation I’ve ever seen. It’s crazy!!! So so so SOOOOOOO creative 🤯🤩
I havrnt been more interested in maths in my life
We learned math on 14:02 minute
This is impressively accurate and spectacular! 🤩 Kudos to the creator of this piece of art!    e^(i*π) is eternal!
Professor : exams will be easy  Exams :
I can't wait for the next episode wanted And so cool
wait what? terkoiz wrote and partly animated this? as in the guy who made SHOCK all those years ago? no way
wow
6:23
Best movie i have watched in a while
Pov: El profesor de Matemática hizo una colaboración con Alan Becker.
This is the greatest video on youtube.
Ill wait for part 2
this was a legitimate master piece. you never fail to amaze me alan, ever since the original animation vs animator way back when
I'm actually speechless. This was incredible. The imagination behind it, like... wow. I don't know what to say. It's brilliant!
What?????????!?!??! א is in math?!

What happens at the end???
I dare u to do science
Congrats on a amazing video !! Well done ! 👏👏
When you play with maths
Wow ! Mec! Bravo ! Congratulation! It's an amazing job! Love it
Show this When you need to get Students to want to start learning math
Ah an artistic interpretation of the battle of a math student...
I like how one of the most complex and epic fights on the channel happens in the calculator program
what is e in
how he get there though, and what happen after??
I wonder if these symbols will appear again to help
Brain meltingly delightful 😊

This is so cool!!!!!!
This video is amazing, super nerdy, has an interesting plotline, and the sound design is just awesome.

Esse filme foi mais emocionante que todos os últimos filmes da Marvel
Never thought numbers could give me the chills. Bravo !
Прошу вас , вторую часть, делайте ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS MAN MADE A ACTION MATHS MOVIE HOW A TRUE LEDAND
We expect an animation with the formulas of physics.!
Me encantó mucho este video, en especial que el stickman llega de ser 1+1 a llegar entender matemáticas complejas 🗿🎓👌
This is so god damn good
Impressive
"Que loco" ...amazing🎉
Terkoiz must not like e^i22/7
Ong alan just discovered how dna was created
Let's just recap about how smart The Chosen One is.  He managed to learn the entire concept of math, including Euler's formula which is the *hardest* thing I've learned, and along the way in the span of *14 minutes.*
Epic! Love this! Euler is so OP
Bravo!
Math… makes sense…? D:
the music just sounds amazing!!
I wans in stickman side the first
Amazing
Wow
My mind is blown
Good job bro
animation vs meth 💀
My head hurts BRUH but gj
Until 7:53 it was still high school mathematics, couldn’t understand more after that but amazing animation!🫡
Pessoas perguntam: para que vou utilizar a matemática Alan: para fazer vídeos, e ganhar muito dinheiro...STONKS
Wow..
This is so satisfying, I’ve watched this probably too many times already
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING animation here!  I've been watching you since your first Animator v Animation, and it is absolutely awesome to see how far you have come.  You did an absolutely amazing job with this one as well!  Thank you so very much for the awesomeness you bring us!
Math + teachor = boring   Math + alan =  war fith math 😂😂
Just. Incredible.

wow.
somone: "math animations are bad"  me showing him this:
amazing
im gonna kill myself. this that i just saw is just too much for a 12 year old
Thats so satisfying, love it and keep making this kind of educational animations (tbh , I am really waiting for part 2)
@T
This is to much for my brain

I hope he keeps this skill set.. seeing him fight with numbers in regular shorts would be so cool
how can you always make better video?
Nice❤️
I discovered a whole new universe from 2:48 onwards
satisfactory video, very very very satisfactory
Mathematics meets stickfigure fights!
Oh what if TSC used math in the future fighting?
This felt so out of character, he would never chase somee like that >:(
TOP TOP TOP; I didn't thought one time in my life that I will be happy to see and use and predict this "math".  I hope teachers see this masterpiece 🥲
Te luciste mano
now do animation vs meth
I love your job, i watch your animations for a very long time, but this overcame EVERYTHING i've ever seen, it's amazing, i don't have words!
So math is useful for something after all
Diese is my image when im doing my Math homework 😂😂
This was awesome, everything was great, specially the sound design.
This is me calculating how much in-game currency I’ll get if I spend it on a in-game item

Esse vídeo é quase um código do GTA
This masterpiece is worthy of an Oscar! The plot is even better in films with budgets of billions of thousands, this masterpiece will be unforgettable for a lifetime for the audience of this masterpiece, you are simply the most masterpiece of all masterpieces
new way of motivation, tbh its working.
Deu pra entender prr nenhuma, mas oq vale é a animação
I really enjoy you @alanbecker cause you have been around since i was a kid and though the videos are simple the are not which i love so much
Math has never been more exiting!😂
Better than entire bollywod career
Haven’t seen this much unique thought and hard work of production so far... Thanks for the video. Huge satisfaction.... ❤❤
what does f(.) represent ?
yyyyyyyyyyyyy
Wow
Mom: go watch something more educational   Me:
Hello
Fascinating, amazing, fabulous....
I love It dont understand but love it
Please make part2 too😊
It's impressive good work
Damn bro that was that wass.. most entertainment  video i ve ever seen
using math to win a war
Hi
I don't understand the majority of this video because i am bad at math but it's very cool nonetheless
Are blue and yellow in love??? Pls tell me
In this way, who is not going to like mathematics?
кто укр или рус
нихуя не понятно но очень интересно
I can't begin to express how much i love it! It's amazing, fantastic concept, and mind blowing work!
Best 14 min ever.
Can you make animaiton vs minecraft|Meeting the sniffer please If you do so...i will like al of your animaiton vs minecraft episodes
Christopher+Nolan+Who? 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was waiting for the Post credit scene 😂...... Math is too powerful. Great work 💯❤
That went to infinity, and beyond!
13m views in seven days 💀
This one in my opinion is by far 1 of the best ones you've done.. dont get me wrong I like them all just this one I particularly enjoyed 😊
This video is the worst video I have seen in my life. I follow this channel before, and now my love for it has increased. I hope you will continue to publish this content 🥰🥰❤️❤️✨✨✨
I love the detail that using those trigonometric identities, e was able to (in classic e fashion) grow exponentially
As someone that hate math, this was amazing and i learned somethings and not hate math at all anymore just dislike rn 😊
idk how, but this man explained math while giving math a villan
Орудие которое он создал против е это обнулятор 3000
Only one thing to say, beautiful
you a video game for learn math.
9:46 the a ti-life ecutio
never thought i could watch maths this way. Surprised. Loved it. 👍
wow
This video is the best animation of all those I saw!!!
I need to see a video explaining this in spanish because I don't get this enmaculate master piece
I dont understand nearly half of this, I just watched it for the animation :)
Me-what is maths
This needs to be in short film awards
I too was fighting for my life everyday in math class
aleph zero is much bigger
This is the coolest thing that i have ever watch in math 😂❤️🔥🔥🔥
Greatest piece of work Alan has ever made. Breathtaking.
It got recommended right before my maths class RIGHT ABOUT complex numbers and theory of equations
Une dinguerie en vrai
My mind during an Math exam
So how did he get there?
Maja aagya ❤❤
Wow... just wow...
See with only a slight change of perspective, math can be fun But as far as we know Math is boring
Dios este sujeto puede hacer una animacion de operciones matemáticas y nunca aburrirte es increíble las cosas que hace jaja ❤😃
No Alan video would be complete without a humanoid monster antagonist
Nose math pero prefiero los gameplay
Just because of this I want to fight with numbers
and now we see how math is actually fun not boring as we used to think when we was little kids
This is awesome. I litteraly have nothing to say, so i'm just commenting so YouTube can see this video is good stuff.
đây là khi nghệ thuật và khoa học cùng khiêu vũ trên một nền nhạc
I think this is the best video I have ever seen ever
i just watch te video with a "WOOOOAAAAAH!!!" face :3
Todo o meu curso de matemática resumido em um único vídeo. Ameeei. Ps.: esse é o ápice da cultura nerd: animação + jogos de luta + matemática haha
eu nunca sorri tanto com um vídeo sobre matemática na minha vida cara
yo solo dejo mi huella, de que vi esta obra de arte
Espetacular! Tudo muito bem elaborado 👏👏👏👏 você é um génio!  Além do vídeo ser muito,muito bom, ainda consegue desmistificar o problema da matemática. Se em todas as escolas no mundo desde os primeiros anos ,ensinassem matemática com animação e explicação …. Todos entenderiam melhor matemática e isso é muito importante. Parabéns pelo vídeo 👏👏👏👏
Wait a damn minute, waa that that.. that... that. The symbol of the zoo pride at the end....
Типичный я на контрольный:
🤨
NOW I KNOW 1+1=3
i wouldve  been a mathematician if the teachers taught like this i feel like watching it will teach me everything about math
this seems too complex for my little 9yo brain and its a great animation seriosuly
Holy math 👀
2:51  Welcome in the matrix

Holy mother of Jesus Christ and Joseph! This is so addictive. I can't even .... Like what! You are the god of mathematics.
Yeah, so orange gets teleport? Like the original black...? 😎cool
I am amazed. Like actually, how in the earths heck did you make such a *boring* school topic so much fun! Like actually, for something based around maths that was so much fun to watch! Actually really great!
Really a masterpiece😮👏. Great job 👍
Khan Academy's been real quiet since this dropped 🔥
Mate 👍
i like this
wow
Tuve un dia horrible, gracias Alan me hizo feliz ver esto
That has got to be the most creative and brilliant thing I've ever seen 😢❤🔥
Alan Becker and his team are the only people that can make MATH look cool
Very comprehendable
how can you animate an "e"???
part-2 is a must
Keep up the good work.This will be inspirational for a lot.
I think this was the most beautiful animation I've seen in a long time
Better way to learn maths than school homework.
13:40 *Greece has joined the chat*
how did you make math interesting?
Talento puro !!!!!!
i have an idea, what if the stickmans place upgrades to windows 11
It gets better the more you watch it. And all animations are somehow related to the things on the screen at that time. Great job!
Those days😍😍🥺
The best way to remember the math knowledge. Absolutely beautiful work. Thank you for such a masterpiece!
Bruh
Hai....why are you guys not giving likes on this video......🤬🤬🤬
Nice
Im Amazed. Im absolutely speechless. Like i felt real Excitement and Enjoyment in this video. Thank you for showing me the true animation
Oh my god my brain
Something tells me that there was more soundeffect work than animation work
Cool animation, i like it!
As a Math lover THIS IS THE MOST GENIUS THING I'VE EVER SEEN
Why is the end so emotional
Это самое увлекательное видео про математику, которое я видела за всю свою жизнь! И математика, и боевик❤

Bruh, this whole story could be a full 12 episode anime where the protagonist learns the powers of math magic.
Woow just woww
Por isso que não se mexe com matemática

10:00 WAAAAA
Make it with after effect?
12:46 good ending? with aleph null. i think
As an engineering student the best animation i have ever seen
I usually hate math, but this masterpiece is sick
Part 2 pls😢😢
Incredibly creative and fun.
Wouaw
How do you animate? Also I love your vids I’d watch them every day if I could
this is the best way to understand math
That was something to see, must have taken a lot of work.

Animator vs animation VI please pt 2
This is like doing math as a group of numbers and simbles working to make what was missing and the question was  100-1-1-98-1 was-1 but was eipi
XD
What a beautiful video! This video used the world's most beautiful equation!
The way they changed direction when hit by negative sign. Great details 👍
8:30 cod zombies?

Never have I understood this much math... not even with a million classes😂😂
Bro opened my third eye
multymath of madness
so brilliant
and it's all from the number "1"💀
Bro just thaught us math in the best way possible

Aleph null is the smallest form of infinity and it's still massive
You have singlehandedly broken the internet with this animation, and don't be shocked to see references to ur work in movies to come. My God is this Science and art unified in a beautiful way.

As impressive as this was, at this phase of time, I have come to hate Maths to such an extent that getting me to like it now would be the same as declaring war on the sun and hoping for victory.
If someone made a live action movie it would be so fking awesome
Omg 😮
Someone explain to me what did he split π to in 6:46

Holy jesus. Best video I've seen ever and i dnt even understand maths. ❤
great work, bro.
wow
i will watch the ads because you deserver all of this ad revenue
My man's a god he drew a perfect circle
Bro there should be a sandbox/pvp game of this math dimension 😮
he can make any videos entertaining i mean ANYTHING!
imagine if math was done in a video game where to win and defeat the final boss you actually have to know how to do math.. everyone would know math!
Awesome Video . Please make a part2 of this with Higher orders Abstract Algebra , Groups , Manifolds and  topology. Please please
Math is my favorite subject although I don't get good grades at it but really love it, its so cool that they turned math into a very fun and creative way, I only understood like half of it since in still young, I watch the over analysis of it and understood 90% of it
Caption should be Animator Vs Math
bro is smarter on math in 10 seconds while I can’t even understand math in 10 years💀
Shared! Congrats! FANTASTIC!
The more you understand math , the more you love this video ❤❤
I bet if albert einstein was alive and watching this
Alan made math even mathier
Beautiful
I have a math question what 10+9 ?
INCREDIBLE WORK!
Essa animação pode se tornar o melhor game educativo que já existiu.
I wish this was a video game
4:45 This part is TCO vs Clippy all over again.
math is really difficult😢
it was a boring math video and become and epic battle
It was discovered that someone was stealing
Alan play  kidpix
i wish maths tutorials were like this
Hello robins secreat is    …Read more
literally, it's called a calculated battle
ALAN YOU'RE FROM THE BEST ANIMATORS OF YT, AND I THINKED OF ABT WHAT IF YOU COLLAB WITH HYUN'S DOJO, ANOTHER GOOD ANIMATOR TO DO THE BEST STICMAN ANIMATION EVER
Programming version please😂

3:42 Did he missed the chance to show √4 = 2 and -2? It must have been good that there are two solutions like a superposotioned number.

Aim happy-and you comentarii back
Only one word came to my mind... amazing....👍🏻
mathematically correct build
❤
hey i am your 11 year old subscriber
Best animation so far but what is the background music you using Alan?
After all these years, a new season of Gurren Lagann is finally available. Thank you
I liked the mathematical machine gun and laser artillery that orange utiliced. I need one of these XD
🤝🤝🙌
The music made the video perfect 😌
This is probably the most creative "Animation vs _______" video you've ever made. And the associated visuals with all the equations and operations is what really brings this to life. I wouldn't be surprised if some teachers actually use this to introduce their students to some of these more abstract mathematical concepts.
Who knew math could be used in star wars
The ending definitely looks as though it ties into AvA VI
Buen video animado para entender la matemática en todo su explendor. 🎉
Eso fue increíble
As an engineering student, I somehow can relate... When I first encountered imagineries, it was a strange beast. The seconed time, when I had a lil more knowledge and tool, it became a monster. Everything I've learned became tool to brake this monster appart, but as I got more advanced tools, the monster grew bigger. It was only when I really needed imaginaries that Ive started to apriciate the beast. It became a friend, managing to calculate in more ease. Its strange rules started to make sense, and I could use it in new ways.
POV ur doing a test:
i love your vidios and olso whan is the new vidio?
gnuftastig
part 2!!!!!
Would like a link to all music used here. Seriously. What is the music used in the video?
Where do you get the sound effects?
Thanks to my maths teacher becoz of whom I am able to understand this video
👍👍👍
my brain is completely filled with potato
This is actually very exhilarating and thoughtful! (i understand nothing past the 5 minute mark)
4:53 rotation theorm 🔥🔥
Really good, can continue like this.  best math animated movie
BRO IS LITTERIALY TEACHING MATH BETTER THAN MY SCHOOL, AND YES, IN EVERY WAY

One of the best animations I've seen!! Enjoyed every second! Thank you!!!
I have never been so excited to learn math . like this time
Best animation video i have ever seen.
That escalated quickly This went from 1+1 to mathagodzilla
Sözelcilerin bir bok anlamadan ekrana baktıkları başka bir video daha.
His math teacher is gonna be so happy when they see this animation
The boss was such a nerd
Poor euler. all they wanted is to be left alone. But they were forced into war and it basically destroyed their home... Never thought I'd feel so sorry for an number
For me math and equation is like the meaning of life I'm saying that math and life is inunderstandable but you will learn that life is important like math that's all😊😊😊 hope you all understand.

I enjoyed watching the whole video while being educated about more topics related to mathematics
We want animator vs biology
You should make an Animation vs. Chess next
It should be shown in schools every day! What a masterpiece! 🤯
Calculus on 1st year be like:
Now I wanna learn advanced math so badly
Awesome! ❤
This is my whole syllabus of maths in aroud 15 mins
😱😱WOW
This is like a Christopher Nolan’s movie ngl 😂
He made a death star out of math
I don't know what you mean by sin and cos and i and and everything else after that 🤣
Alan creo.que quiere recordarme que reprime matematicas

Like how the Summation symbol is a floating symbol that fires the answer
Hey alan becker where is episode 2 in wanted

Every second of this video is worth watching.. Great job Alan
❤
What cool math games should’ve been
Bro, I learned more math here than my school
My brain needs a year to process this video and am sure I still can't. ❤
Learned more about math in these 14 minutes than in my entire school years

Great animation and math skills I ever seen❤❤❤❤
i was never more interested in math
Animation VS Undertale please btw ur videos r great
Im wating for "Animation vs m3th, breaking bad"
I like the idea of math being put in an animation then slowly making it more complex... It's pretty cool and appealing to me, a math nerd.
Why does it feel like this is how I solve my equations
Please alan beker can you do part 2 of animation vs animator please 😅
He is smarter than my math teacher 😂😂😂
He is smarter than my math teacher 😂😂😂
BRO THE ANIMATION NEED TO CHILL
Better than action movies
Можете скинуть музыку, которая используется для видео?
I had never enjoyed anything like this 😂😂😂  Sooo goood 🔥  Just blown 🤯
What if orange made a graphaling hook
Math is my favourite now..
my dreams before the upcoming test:
Keep up the good work love it
I loveeee🎉🎉🎉
I gotta be honest, This video changed my life (I'm not exaggerating)
I think I can speak for a lot of people here when I say that math has never been my favourite subject. It has always fascinated me immensely on a theoretical plain but I've never understood how to apply the concepts in real life or in exercises. And still, out of all the content I've seen in my 19 years of life, this is the most fascinating, thrilling and amazingly well done video I've ever seen. You made me want to get out of my comfort zone and finally understand it all. Sincerely, thank you.
If ever there was a masterpiece, this would be it.
Now we want a Animation vs Physics, Animation vs Chemistry, Animation vs Biology, Animation vs Geography, Animation vs History, etc, etc. Please Alan Becker make this happen, It would be awesome if this happens
Gokil
Me when I lose focus on my exam
me vs math
ахуенно
MATH was me favorite subject at school thx for remembering me THAT 😊
bro turned math into a all out battle
Blud became a rocket scientist afterwards
4:41 me at math class
Disliking this is a crime
this has made math so much more interesting.
Please add animation vs PHYSICS
I love how the soundtrack for this fits for someone discovering something new in the universe
where is youtube's comment
Make the stick figures fight team fortress 2 mercenaries
Someone needs to make a game out of this
Bruh, hard pass
حد و حدود خودتو بدون من دانش آموز رشته ریاضیم
omg
😍
Man showed us a better math lesson than normal math teachers can.
the only homework i would ever do
You should do animations vs code like loops functions and algorithms it would be pretty cool
The best video
Who is here after instgram....
It never was never this cool when trying to study it.
How to. Play with maths 👍
Love your content and wish to see more in the future!
Amazing ❤
next one, chemistry
Просто безумный ролик, спасибо! Ещё больше полюбил математику)
This serves as a perfect gameplay for math haters.  This is 10/10!  Animation principles are judiciously at work here and the storytelling is impeccable. The SFX and soundtrack are just right. Love it!
Bro really said “🤓”. 💀
dude this is one of your best animations
This have to be one of the best videos i have ever watched in my life
Never in my life thought id be so invested in watching an stickman play around with numbers even tho i hate math
Excellent work!!. With pieces of art like this one, the beauty of mathematics is better appreciated.
I like maths, but as a 15 year old im not that freaking good to get this...
С математикой у меня плохо. Но качество анимации просто на высоте!!! Отлично!!!
w
Imagine i studying more than 12 year but still stupid a math,then this mfs Orange can mastered it after like 5 minutes
my man explan math in a interesting way
Hiw did second even end up here 💀
COOL 😮
2
Hats off
That's awesome 😎 👏,  how days take to make this?
The fact is alan remember his maths class😂
wow
I hate math
I'm never trusting eⁱ🥮 ever
Math was never this fun
Stickman: break the matrix
did.. i hear keyblade noises at 4:46?? i love this, allen u a mad lad  the moment i saw that scene, i knew the generic kindom hearts 3 hit  combo, im probably the only one that saw this!!
I am sure this is best thing I have seen on YouTube ! ❤
and it all started with 1+1
the fact that it just screaming like that: "WEEEEEEAA!!!"
Waiting "Animation vs History"
What you doing when euler identity attacks you on the street?
Oh my god ... that's amazing
Yoo this is fire! Keep up the great work👍
i love your work!  awesome = ParametricPlot[{   {16 Sin[t]^3, 13 Cos[t] - 5 Cos[2 t] - 2 Cos[3 t] - Cos[4 t]},   {4 + 3 Cos[t], 3 + Sin[t]},   {12 + 3 Cos[t], 3 + Sin[t]},   {8 + 6 Cos[t], -3 + 0.5 Sin[t]} }, {t, 0, 2 Pi},   PlotStyle -> {Black, Black, Black, Black},   AspectRatio -> Automatic,   Axes -> False,   Background -> LightYellow ]; awesome
How quickly it divulges into chaos is why i hate math, and how well Alan takes a despised subject to make it thoroughly entertaining is why i love Alans animations
1+1-2
Cinematice masterpiece
Bro is albert enstine
Multiverse of mathsness🤯
I like it😂
This video killed my brain 💀
POV: you fell asleep during math class
1+1=2😂
I hate maths but my friend who loves maths send me this video and it's literally so interesting and cute
Here after reels?😂
Never thought math could be this fun
😱😱😱 WTF
The best video on yt i have ever watched
Oh! with e^1i! HE GIVES WAR WITH HIS MATH EXPRESSION
8:56 this is space
"Animation Vs. Meth" when???
This is why it is said that God is one. Everything was made from one
😯
someone please make a website like this
EPIC
😷
7:02 that was satisfying
One of the most clean and Accurate Math I have ever seen.
animation vs minecraft
Bro really just dropped the hardest maths animation 💀
Skibidi toilet vs animation 😮😮😮😮😮😮
Didn’t know orange was Asian so that’s where he gets his power
What is e
Uzbek sila 🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
Yeah, you lost me at the waves.
my brain hurts
8:24 *how it feels like to fight cancer cells*
This is insane 😮 Couldn't understand much but this genius..😢
This was absolutely amazing omg
1+1+2+2+3+3+4+4=20
I think he should have just hit it with x 0
this is incredible math
through and this has been exhilarating to see. As a software dev who's been diving
This sound like Transformers
It's all started with 1+1..
*Math isnt hard* SHUT UP
You just dropped masterpiece buddy 😲
Кто от Матвеева?
I want to watch this in iMax 3D❤
Where is animation vs AI?
When my mom came in and asked what I was watching, I immediately switched to porn because that's easier to explain
as a person who HATES math a lot, this is the most confusing video i have ever seen but also amazed by it.
You created a masterpiece which is going to be remembered for a very very long time
The music fits this so perfectly. I especially love how whenever TSC finds something he doesn't understand like dividing by 0 or e^ipi it switches to more earie music.
alan becker is so cool that he made this out of math
E°π * √μ
damm
We need the same with physic or chemistry
I hope next is animator vs science lol
Imagine video about physics😮
Я жду сиквал😢
I dont understand second part of video. I like it
Wow very cool Video - too much maths for me but the animations are so good! ✖➕➖➗ 😵💫
Mind-blowing extraordinary overwhelming awesomee❤❤❤🎉🎉
PEAK😭😭
wow that's very good, then for the reproduction lesson
I be learning math in few seconds
Albert Einstein:
This video made me love the math😂
Where does he get these sound effects!?
2:49 indeterminate
First of all what was that. Second of all that was awesome!
Wow…
Amazing
im very impressive about Alan imagination of all this
Legendry
Pov:the 2 smart kids in school having an argument
im so happy
Let's do again with quantum physics 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
do with Physics too!
there is christopher nolan and there also is alan becker
Only a person that 'understands' maths well could make a animation this beautiful.
YouTube is an math nerd now 💀
What did I just look at?
The mathematical world
kerebangat
How tf is a animated stick smarter then me
of course it's difficul to make that animation. thanks.
insane animation here ~_~
bro dropped the best educational math video on youtube
This is such a great example of creativity and knowledge working together
Me with F in math: Is that a magic?
mind fucking video boss 💯💯💯
Post a new video already
I hate math
😊😊😊Mình rất vui 🎉😂
So this is why people hate math…
Math is aladay my favourite it's my super favourite now.
😊😊😊😊😊😊
Your video is so good. I love it
Animation vs. Code ?
What about Animation VS 4th dimension?
Master piece ❤
A masterpiece!
It's.... the best i saw last year... Action blockbuster about mathematics... Fabulous.
Wow
it's been long time since I haven't saw those vids
❤❤
It's so fascinating and calming to watch. I keep on watching till the end with silence
Masterpiece. This is a very amazing way to visualize the greatness of mathematics, well done Alan.
All math in 14 minutes
Man.. I didn't know I knew this much mathematics..
animtor is gone this is sad but e make the animator gone
Bro made math look fun
Chess? Rubix cubes?
Somehow I understand them equations
Did orange die
Glad to see him finally learn something in school.
why theres e but e an f is not a number number is a math
This is absolutely impressive, captivating, fun, and educating. I applaud you. I can only imagine the amount of time, effort, and thought put into this. Thank you❤
Best video ever seen
Part 2 please ❤
sos  un  CAPO
Wowed we invent heck
This video is a masterpiece.
Just one request, please add a note in the title "use headphones" 🙏
im too idiot
1+1=2
i have learnt something for today Always mess with math
"How will this help me in the real world" the teacher:
I got emotional when aleph showed up ;_;
I enjoy this very very much
I did like this          My mind hurts a lot now and I didn't understood like 80% of most things, but hey, maths
Masterpiece🙌
Que increíble animación 10/10
I wàtched this video before my math exam   And I somehow failed
0:00 Firstly  0:01 orange wake up  1:00 start Orange learning knowledge  3:42 Orange  begins to want to escape from the world of math  5:21 war  7:32 cam tries every way to generate eix number but it's stuck  9:45 disaster  10:03 every letter broken by endless laser fairy  13:20 know each other's fault  14:02 the+end
A kid that just watching the video be like: Oh so this is Albert Einstein
do you
wow
plese make part 2
It all started with 1.
I can't believe it's been 14 minutes already
1+1=2
14mins of my time I'll never want back, outside the fact that i don't understand most of the mathematical problems, solutions, and formulae. the sound design and animation is just AWE. THIS IS INSANELY SUPERB.
I really thought that who made this animation 😮
I didn't know the chosen two is fr doctor ianstine and combine all of da smartest people
This was probably the coolest animation i’ve ever watched, the sound, the dynamic movement, and the dramatic scenes and portrayal of the characters emotions were all so amazing… plus i like math 😅  Great work!
I've never been excited about math in my life till I started screaming about the sin and cos waves. Bruh, well done guys.
My teacher showed the class this, can't say I wasn't invested in this video.
Can you do Animator vs msm Plz
@Youtube Who Asked?
you are a great artist. keep it up
this stickman is better at math than me 😭
This is creativity at its finest! 👌👌😂
I could understand almost everything until minute 13:00 and the integral :)
👍😣😚
Now THIS is what math should be like in school.
Strongest number = ∞
I can't believe a stick figure knows more than a human being, like bro really went from numbers to letters?
how to do your math homework just in 14 minutes
Bro literally going through every single grade
Not Being a math nerd, the math concept here really confuses your brain 😂
Im  confused
YouTube!
😱
You!
My TEN year old just shared this with me. He was fascinated, the visual way these concepts were being shown really connected with him. SO well done!!
Incredible animation!
I got confused at 1 + 1
They should make a sequel for this like, I wonder what’s going to happen to δ, ζ, φ, ℵ, and e^iπ.
curse you, Euler's number
Wow... Simply wow!
That's why I hate math
Animation vs real life,  just an idea
8:55 - 9:29 tell me if this doesn't look like something from a battel royal/doom eternal game
sey gex
Oh my God
Great idea! All kinds of mathematical formulas are represented by animation.😊
2:02 i was like WTH
math's fun right?!
I used to watch you now 3 years later, im still watching you to this day
❤️❤️ creativity on next level
As a math lover myself, he really did explains maths in most creative way i have ever seen.
No puedo parar de ver esta obra maestra.
Even i couldn't understans rn
Calm down people, it's going to happen. Someone will understand 3+Dimensions!!
every second of awesomeness 😮
bro shook hands with e's lower jaw
so easy
1+1 = 2
Wow,
Symbols That In Episode 2 Alpha Beta Eta Omega Symbols That In Episode 3 Psi Mu Omicron Rho Symbols That In Episode 3 Tau Upsilon Hi Iota Symbols That In Episode 4 Kappa Lambda
This is the best animation I have ever seen.  Just unbelievable
r/mathmemes
What program do you use to animate?
The e is so cute
leaving the comment here so whenever someone like this comment i remember this masterpiece
genius
Damn this was dope af
bro legit just explain to me what sin and cos is. im senior year college btw.
牛逼啊，什么时候做化学，物理，生物的
Como de suno iritue yaikatu toko figu luyammen sukatan👍👍 sriguh kalo. Tipikal
Bro Is A nerd🤓🤓
this animation hurts my brain, but is so fricking cool at the same time
mind blowinggggggggggg man
nice good and amazing
Youtube likea mafs?
In school: when will I ever use this.  In real life:
I think I managed to grab a good bit of it but how does 9tan(i) make a derivative gun
bro just created interdimensional traveling
E portal
what is the music that plays in the background called???????????
Since im kind of a math nerd i really wanna see a video explaining the scenes, im also pretty young so im still studying but a full on explanation while being able to watch an awesome animation about math would be amazing.
deserve an oscar
The part when he hits it is sick 8:13
If math can be possible be made to this creative visualization. I can't wait for other subjects like chemistry. It will help teachers a lot because kids nowadays are visual learners.
😍😍😍👽👽👽
I have no idea what happened AT ALL. But this was unexpectedly one of the coolest things i have seen dude. Props to your animation team for making math cool 😎
Imagine if this animation was a game
when my teacher expects me to write down something:
claro
I love how Alan and his team can turn anything into one of the coolest animations ever.
Nah orange became a 6942069420 dimensional being at the end 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Where are orange friends?!?!
Dude reply on Most Liked Comment?
AEEEE VC VOUTO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
thanks, Alan Becker, i finally can solve my math problems!

*It’s all started with click click of f(•) weapon.*
Wher is green and yellow red
This goes beyond Interstellar
As a math teacher: my students are never gonna see the end of this!
I'm a complete idiot in math but this still captivates me. I really want to be able to understand math but I'm forever stuck at like, 4th grade math.
how about the physics
Can we make a time machine with numbers? 👁👄👁
Damn. That was an epic fight.
Понял больше чем за 9 лет учёбы в школе
¿con que software fue realizado?
i hate methamatics
Why is Euler so mean
mind boggled
What impresses me are the sound effects. Like... HOW 🙂
This is so sick ❤
Pls Part 2
The second chosen is know Math in 13 minutes 😮
Pov: ur next subject is math  Me: 😭😭😭
Mr. Orange. A Stickman who is now super Smart in Math ( dayum the Powerful gun that Orange used is awesome. )
is it crazy that I think I learned something???
ESTO ES UNA GENIALIDAD 😂😂😂😂 AHORA ENTIENDO PORQUE EL NUMERO e ESTAN JODIDO.
Very nice
Beautiful.
is god!
If there's a round 2,can we have algepra and coord. Geometry
10:00 the transformer we should be afraid of
Better than most anime
🤯
cosplay
this needs to be a game
As a math fanatic I can definitely say I love this ♾️+1
THIS IS FREAKING NERDY. You make boring math into something incredible. And I love it Alan.
I use photomath
no entendi ni una wea pero es increible XD
it was sad at the end a little they just became friends to the end
what just happened
like for a video of Animation vs Programming :D
Yo what the anyways I Alan I’m your biggest fan!
Very great animation 👍
Hi
bro im so invested into this, if you were to make a channel learning about math like this things would go so smoothly with everyone
la droga de los inge
The gun vs the army 🪖 XD 8:33
This video may be 6 days old but I've watched it about 8 times now
Hi
Very impressive 🔥
Me after watching this:  Brain.exe is not responding
I'm starting university, my career has a lot of math. I do not understand many of those things, but I do understand that this video is absolutly wonderfull mathematically, youtubely, animationly, enterteinmently, musically, and a lot more of lys
the best video ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
And here comes the wholesome Mathverse....
Saw this at Facebook yesterday and DAMN I'M IMPRESSED with the whole video.
bro is literally the gameplay of richard watterson playing the calculator
The big N in the end is avagadro's number if anyone was wondering
Moral of the video: Math can sometimes be your worst enemy or Math can sometimes be your greatest ally.

Bro we neeb part 2 of wanted stick man bro
:v este video acaba de ejemplificar resolver y plantear los conceptos matemáticos básicos los primeros minutos de manera muy simple , natural e inocente  :v como estudiante de ingeniería que se cachuelea enseñando mate :v esto me parece increíble
Bro turned math into a who Disney storyline  LMAO 🤣 💀
<
I think this man is a genius in math 🥰
The coolest sh$t EVER!!!! 🥰 I AM SO HAPPY! I've watched you evolve for years. Keep it up
Aaa mi cerebro we
Chances of YouTube commenting on a video are ultimately low, With just a chance of 3%
This both interests me and scares me
Math is amazing
Now I want to see math vs physics and math vs music
Cool
What is the music used in this video called
another masterpiece from alan KEEP IT GOING!!!
oh!
9:43 I see calc 2 is being a menace as always
What does this mean? 🤔
I was late but still an epic animation
I missed the live
Não sei por que mas a matemática ficou até interessante depois que vi esse video
Something that doesn't make sense in the video:  1. The relationship between theta*r and theta/r. 2. The "imaginary world" itself. They're already in the complex plane.
Indeed,Math is the language of the universe.
e+?=∑
Amazing
WHAT A MASTERPIECE!! I FINISHED THE VIDEO LOVING MATH ❤️‍🔥👏👏
marvel has nothing on this
1:07 I love how this zoomed out shot conveys the idea that TSC has only scratched the surface of the vast and endless possibilities of math, with how much space is still around him.
I feel so dumb after this video, there's too much going on, and It's incredible
Beautiful, perfect, wonderful, 10/10
Animation
yo soi fan de las matematicas
guauuuu
i love it
I clapped at the end of this. Excellent work.
The most ambitious crossover in a decade
Math is my trauma since grade 4
Excellent educational video.
🤓👆 3×3=6
this is so good for me. tks
I hope a maths teacher could explain this to me😂❤
More pls
te volaste
now, this is a way to make math interesting
This is the greatest piece of cinemathic unit ever to exist!  All puns aside I truly enjoyed this
Fuaaa lo que aprendí en un segundo
Ufff nooo
Don't call me a nerd, call me a mathemagician
Please tell me this is how math was invented
As a computer engineer, this must be the best animation I've ever seen.  Thank you for doing this!
we need a part 2, this was awsome
pov: my brain in school
me man das saludos¿
what is e to the power of i pi?
Im glad i learned math in high school si I can kinda understand whats going on… makes you wonder how actual math relates to physics and the possibility of other dimensions
otro yutuber reaiciono a este video se llama chumai😁☺😉
What...
What a movie! Thank you so much for this vídeo, it was amazing to watch!
Você não pode fazer esse vídeo com a voz em pode fazer
This was so good I made my own animation like this😂
Math in the future
Ya se como crear una arma capaz de destruir planetas XD
Alan becker... congratulations for at creators, i have great harry for watch 👍
12 million views in 6 days for something that isn’t a music video is insane
hello :)
Me too
14 Minutos exelente
Alan and the trampolin🤨🤨
Alan really made people *who don't like Math* like math.
2
11:26, calculator has crashed
Isso mostra o quão psicopata alguém consegue ser
A new classic?
I’m order to understand the lore, you literally need to keep taking all your math classes and then some. It will make you enjoy it more 😊
"Our kid will be a math teacher" "no he will be an animator" *meanwhile this guy :
This needs to win in the academy awards
Well I enjoyed watching that
I got a whole bunch of your Merch for my birthday today! And I love it! It’s so cool
wuaw
perfect
My mind during a math test:
This is a masterpiece.
How will he tell his friends about this one
this is so COOL
School taught us this in 25 years, while bro over here taught us in 14 minutes i feel like my life wast wasted
Bro became Elbert
i want you as my Math Teacher
Math 2
Too much Math
This is one of the best videos I've ever seen in my life
I can't wait for the breakdown video by some Ph.D confirming all the math is correct.
В финале «e» предал и стёр оранжевого?
X1.
Do the animation vs programation
in 14 minutes, orange has learned more math than me in 16 years 🤯🤯  P.S. wonderful video Alan, u such a legend as always!
This is incredible 😊😊😊😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
dang, better than many movies
Don't worry guys our stickman didn't cease to exist.  It went to an infinite i dimensional space what we can only call absolute freedom. Probably the dimension he is currently in is only made up by infinite number of imaginary quantities but for him those imaginary quantities are real as this chair and he cannot interact with us. More like parallel universe. Bro born in the two dimensional canvas and he went into parallel hyper dimensional space. even though he cannot interact with us, I am pretty sure he find god out there somewhere or he became one with that power.
2+2=5
매우 재밌었어요! 당신을 존경합니다
Just WOW
wow💫
Cool math and animation
NO! it is still alive. 😭
OMG this is wonderful
Simplemente hermoso
super genial
music almost sounds Marvel
Did everyone notice this  😂 6:00 TSC was holding the "+"  as a cross 🤣🤣🤣
Acuerdense que esta hermosa animacion sera usada para futuras generaciones que esten aprendiendo matematicas
Someone could make a minigame for pc with this wonderful story.  +1
Hey why does the gun chamge at 10:36 ??? It goes back to the dot instead of the infinity it had
I feel like this s going to be in school classes in the future
math is powerfull
This is PERFECTION! This man deserves an oscar!
Amazing
Me trying to remember my A levels maths knowledge from years ago to make sense of this video lol. I have an appreciation but not full understanding
eiπ
私は数学が嫌いですがこの動画を見て少し好きになりました
If TSC is this good at math I am afraid of how good yellow will be
Can you give me this stickman link ??
eiπ
The power of math
simply amazing
hola alan te que ria preguntar si odrias poner un personaje de color rosa mexicano , seria lindo que por lo menos podria ser un personaje de fondo o en 2do plano grax
I want to say "this animation doesn't make any sense", but I now that this aniamation is, in fact, correct, and I don't know how to feel about it
i love this so much
La animación más pro que he visto en años
This is a fun animation ILOVEIT❤
Alan...HOW DI YOU DO IT ?! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE!! KEEP DOIN WHAT YOU DOIN AL MEH PAL❤
This can be an amazing game
We need captions for that 😂
1=♾
Now I'm gonna wait for animation vs geometry
I imagine what it would be like if it were a game, where the objective was to defeat this enemy and escape this world, without clues, trying to do puzzles with mathematical calculations, it would be epic
era 2:30 e eu já não tava entendendo mais nada
The+End=thend😉
caculator:hard mode(good ending)
This is the best math short I've ever seen, how can 14 minutes beat Disney, he also has an epic fight against Euler('e' an irrational nombre next to his formula) and many mathematical things (pi, imaginary number, cos, sin, etc).
Man props to the soundtrack as well, it fits so well, and gives an extra depth to all the actions happening on screen, the discovery moments are so satisfying to see, thanks to this incredible soundtrack, the battles and everything, plus the sound design is incredible too. This is a great video on all aspects, really enjoyed watching it plus seeing math teachers reacting to it with great satisfaction as well. Great job.
God❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
Este video es más educativo que los que nos hacen ver en las escuelas!!!
Delightful Math: 9:46
Storyline too
This video has just exploded, and with the sound quality it should screened in a large cinema.
Sorry music and sound
Если б в школе так математику показывали бы, то я б в неё влюбился.
The animation and music is amazing in this
i wish this was everyday class
bro imagine a math game like this
wither storm vs Animations pliss
This is awesome
I am wondering how Orange ended up in the algebra void in the first place?
א
incredible dude! thx
The sound design is 😊
This is humans vs zombies
This is super cool omg
This is the embodiment of "look away for 10 seconds and they're learning quantum physics"
Good video but Pin me plz
Now you need Animation vs Science
He forgot the points 5.7
I cried
Infelizmente matemática não é assim
I learned math more through this video compared to 12 years of school 🤯🤯
My brain has stopped braining
1+1=11
Im gonna show this to my future kids n tell them this is how math was invented
I ALLWAYS hated maths. But the fact that Function of a decimal point incide Radius to the power of 100 x Pi x Sin and Tan can create a massive laser of doon that can destroy the fabric of maths it's self? Dang
Incrível, me lembro ainda do animator vs animation,  como evoluiu nesses anos :D
amazing!
The amount of creativity bro
1:49 gone into 4th dimension, where numbers like this belong
god this is a good idea
The best ending to the best shooter animation EVER😂😂😂, nah but this was so entertaining!
1+2=4
1+1=3
Esto sí es cine
Can you make part 2?
Kenn you do mor like that
please second part. make an Animation vs Music it could look good.
I just LOVE all the details
What happed to the lore
My husband showed me this. As the math got more and more chaotic, two things went through my mind: 1) I'm tripping BAAALLLS, WHAT IS HAPPENING?? and 2) DAMN that animation is so smooth and creative! Well done! 👏👏👏
Lost track when he ripped the π in half
math is cooler then it is
This might be the new best YouTube video
imagine that it would be a VR game, that would be cool!
Los detalles matemáticos de este video son hermosos, belleza de video 😎👌
POV : me vs my math homework 😑📚📒📖📝
What was bro's beef with eiπ anyways💀
LETS FUCKING JOE▂▃▄▅▆▇█▓▒░ Jdkdjdkdkdjdkdjdkdjfkdkdjfjf ░▒▓█▇▆▅▄▃▂
Muito foda 👌
We need math vs animation 2 this time with differentials , series , sequences and quadratic, cubic and non linear differential equations
es curioso que cuando aprendes a programar asi empiezas a ver las matematicas y la forma en invocarlas mas facil
MATH THE MOVIE?!!
This animation has made me appreciate mathematics in ways i never did before. Bravo
Imagine this video would be introduction video for sin cos tan math at presentations
Every kid after watching it😢😂😵‍💫
Masterpiece
Bro is Tony Stark
I think this is Alan's most historical video... He evolutionized math in animation forever...
11+2
I learned more maths from this video than from 7 years of school
Beatiful.
can you please make purple pink dark blue and gray
Yall should do animation vs. science next
How the chosen one was made
Dude he went from kindergarten to beyond the smartest
That's beautiful
#1 Math visualization   teachers will make good use of this
My guy explained math better than math teachers in less than 20 minutes
Why not to deritative
The effort put into this is insane however infinity is not a real number
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome perfect❤❤❤❤❤
I wish teachers thought math like this, then math lessons would me much easier tbh. Also very good animation. It brought back those math things back that I had to learn in school, like tan, sin and so one.
Im learning so much but at the same time forgetting it after seeing it
1+12 🧠😌
This video taught me basic math lol
guau
This is too cool and also really interesting way to learn math. Best math video on YouTube! 😀👍
when e to the pi i apeared i was fangirling so hard

Pasenle esto a Mates Mike
This guy is a animation god
Now I regret not learning math properly.

It's the first time, i see more 10m of math atention hahahaha
*“You will never use all these equations in your life”, they said*  And then we have this guy right here.
i never seen youtube leaving a comment. what did just happaned? math???
It will be cool if they all got voices
Здесь я узнал больше математики чем в моей школе.
nos queda mucho por descubrir
I hope e will get placed in the main story
Bro! This is so well made, I love it! Never thought that it was possible to make a fight based on math in this way.
I just cannot
me at 3am without internet
This is the best animation of all YouTube. Congratulations, this felt like a movie and this should be played in schools
cos isin
ooooh so this is how albert Einstein invented math!
I don't understood mostly of the terms over here, but everything was just awesome, and yeah... pretty much how I survived Maths
I didn't understand it was nothing but I liked it that's what matters
Bro teach me maths!
This perfectly corresponds with the pain of trigonometry
Amazingly beautiful.
I loved!! we need more videos of these🤩
se entiende mejor cuando aprendes algebra
No me gusto el video y que eres unos de mis animaciones favoritas😢
2X+3=9 X=
10:01 funny e
Euler, Erdős, Gauss, Euclid, Archimedes, Newton, Laplace, Riemann, Hilbert, Weil, and von Neumann like this video.
Por eso tú profe de matemáticas y siempre decía que las matemáticas son divertidas😂😂😂
it's fabulous ...... i can't explain the feelings in  my heart .... while watching this
Essa é a animação mais inteligente que eu já vi
You made math entertaining AND gave it lore. I never thought I'd watch a math tutorial lol    If I ever became a math teacher, I'd totally show this to my students at the end of the year!
i need more of these

Creativity, Animation, and Math at its peak.....God Level !!!
bro after coming back from jail bro is gonna fight with the power of numbers
The fact that Allen can fights out of math is insane
this was a masterpiece
"When will I ever use this" when you will ever use it
Xem hoạt hình thôi cũng đau đầu nữa
loving the video, actual interest in maths. Love the sound design too, i kinda want the background track as a seperate piece to be honest
wow i love the animation !!!
The best
the dead laser 10:28
It was gorgeous
I give full respect on the video it inspired me to be crazy in and create idea on this topic
That's pretty good
شيئ جميل ويستحق التقدير برافو  جميعكم رائعين
this is a masterpiece
this is what I am thinging about on my math exam:
I see a great effort in the journey of making Animation, just like all the artists, I believe this video conveys a deep, profound, elegant, pure, and philosophical approach to demonstrate the relationship between the truth within the math, the role of humans, and the way of studying about math. The narrative is simple to understand, whereas, once you think about each interaction that characters made with the symbols, there are a lot of stories to tell behind the history of math, and it takes great effort in understanding all of them. The way all the complex idea of history was condensed into one video was insanely cool. I am totally shocked by this video, equal to or beyond the other great videos I watched from Vsauce or 3B1B.
HOWWWWWWWW DOOOOOO YOUUUUUUU MAKEEEEEEE THATTTTTTT THAT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DIFFYCULT THAT PICK 10000 HOURS TO MAKE THAT
Can you make more of the math animations
Me trying to remember what i did last year
did the animation person just die?
I was here
Nice video.
How many decades needed to make so good animation I hate math but this math is so cool
весть матанализ, кратко и с наебкой в конце. Алан, ты гребаный гений. Я словил отдельный шок от плавности анимации и разнообразия того как ты крутил мат формулами. это было прекрасно
We WANT to see this crew dance to the toka toka and then Alan Becker walks in and stares at them in a daze
This man can be literally have created something that we dont know in this video
This is super creative 👏
This is the first time a stick figure does math and it fights math cool
Why don't you make an animation video vs brawl star.
I never thought math can be turned into epic storytelling tool. It seems I underestimated the ability of one and only AlanBecker channel...
Amazing animation! I love it! 😀
top 3 best god fights
does anyone else think that @alanbecker will do a sort of endgame type video with all the other characters and abilitys they have earned over time, as well as all the other characters that they have met. the fact that the entire animation vs minecraft series is canon (yellow has the command block staff) shows that they can bring stuff. its just a thought though!
This video taught me more then I could have in all my math classes combined
4 words: Why do maths exist?
Cool AF
I have no idea what just happend within the last 14 minutes of my life.
Alif Nole in the background 😂😂😂
why is aleph so big
Te fuiste al carajo Alan! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Chapeau! Increíble
The one time where math actually matters
I don't have a words...the way u presented this whole animation & mathematics is out of this universe & the imagination of human, u r god man !! 🔥🔥❤️ Keep it up
Wait this is 14 MINUTES??! I thought this was a short video
this would be grate if somebody would make an interactive game for this.
I didn't understand anything, but it was cool
прикол😅
There are nothing more epic than ani..
i love it
This video let me speechless! Amazing editing, sounding effects and obviously EXPERT math knowledge put all together.
Ilk
I get this type of dreams one night before math exam 😂.. This video is a masterpiece.. Love you bro
How the actual pancake did you visualized math??!!!!
Next animation vs minecraft
Ahhh my brain hurt 💀 I need 1000Iq
Bro confused confusion
Alan, you're such a genius. This is an absolute masterpiece 💫
It is so cool but so creepy .
Bro is lucky YouTube commented
Wow..  It was amazing...  First i saw a short video..  Then for last 24 hrs i was looking for original one.. Now i've found it and it was soo awesome 😂❤ loved it
Круто только жестов нет
Круто только нету слов а все говорят жестами

Can we do “Animation vs Desktop Goose” Please
wow
God level creativity.

This needs to become a game
This ain't animation vs math, this is animation vs calculator 😅
Its fire 🔥 video
Alan you should do a animation vs people playground
Plis make part 2 😀😀😀😀😀
The fact that Alan made math fun in an animation is.. I can't really say, mind-blowing?
Just in 14 min you made people like me happy who likes mathematics. 🤪. PERFECT .  ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
GUAOOOO ES MÁS QUE MARAVILLOSO....
This is awesome, I love it !! What a great imagination you have 😮
I would watch an hour of this
def one of your best videos, I love how much actual math was used!
this is trippy as hell
What "א" means?
Imagine a math teacher shows this too a class

animation vs meth
there is so much secrets with in the math animation
now time to look for the videos that go over every single math concept mentioned in the video...
At the point you get the context about almost most the things happening you know your interest in maths   Btw than you for making video for your asian followers
let them cook
The word Amazing doesn't even begin to describe this.
I want another part cuz it was the best thing I saw
Why am I sad about a number that doesn't even exist
Plzzz do animation vs roblox
1+1=this
This is one of the greatest things ever.  Absolutely love it.
My brain hurts
Most underrated maths video on YouTube 🎉

A gun: =ƒ(•) How I activate the gun guys?
While watching this, i felt like I just discovered the Universe’ secret, could be because of the music and when seeing all the math stuff going on, it’s just astonishing of seeing linear graphs and circles being animated in a cool way, along with Euler’s Number (I think that’s the name?) making a gun and making themself a very COOL boss towards the end.   This is a very inspiring animation to me as Math and animation are my favorite subjects :)
Please part 2
Me playing with my caculator in class:
Such a legend to survive against these equations 🗿🤌
This is AWESOME!!! I've never seen an actual animation based on math before, but it's really cool. The style of the animation includes everything I know about circles, pi, sine, and cosine. From addition to subtraction, and from multiplication, and division, to really cool stuff like exponentiation and root of numbers, to actual function series, or maybe equations related to that, including the Euler's number, this was SUPER COOL. I'm starting to love math now.
I could just imagine the little E character coming from his dimension to save SECOND INE COMING and rest of the characters
I can’t describe to you how much I love this

Este ha sido un video genial, con un sin fin de conceptos matemáticos algunos tanto más leves y basicos, pero no menos importantes ( de hecho fundamentales como: La "aparición del 1" y  el concepto de  "siguiente") hasta cosas tanto más elaboradas como series, función Gamma y ame a "Aquel gigante" Aleph. QUE MAGNIFICO TRABAJO.

how long did this one take?
simply wonderful !!!! 😲
This video blew me away! I was completely engrossed, pausing it several times to delve into the captivating world of math – an area that is usually perceived as boring and overwhelming. However, you brilliantly brought it to life with animation, making it incredibly fascinating and accessible. It's hands down one of the most exceptional and outstanding videos I've ever stumbled upon on YouTube. Massive kudos for your incredible talent and creativity! 👏
PERFEITO.
what was the giant thing at the end?
When you're too good at maths🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
İ want like a alanbecker teacher
this video can be watched forever. It's so mesmerizing
The ancient geometers would be so proud.
How does one make maths soo interesting, AND make sense at the same time?

Making math actually fun to watch was something I didn't think was possible
Arithmetic and Geometry is where science becomes art!
In the brief moment e was alone one of the first things that come to mind is Aleph. And sure enough i was happy to see it.   When a math symbol makes a cameo and I liked it.

How ancient Sumerians was building math:
Absolutely incredible! The animation and motion graphics in this video are truly insanely creative and satisfying If only math was taught this well everywhere
This genuinely is a fantastic application of entertainment and educational. The way these mathematic concepts are visualized are FANTASTIC!
THE MATH LORE  0:07 The simplest way to start -- 1 is given axiomatically as the first natural number (though in some Analysis texts, they state first that 0 is a natural number) 0:13 Equality -- First relationship between two objects you learn in a math class. 0:19 Addition -- First of the four fundamental arithmetic operations. 0:27 Repeated addition of 1s, which is how we define the rest of the naturals in set theory; also a foreshadowing for multiplication. 0:49 Addition with numbers other than 1, which can be defined using what we know with adding 1s. (proof omitted) 1:23 Subtraction -- Second of the four arithmetic operations. 1:34 Our first negative number! Which can also be expressed as e^(i*pi), a result of extending the domain of the Taylor series for e^x (\sum x^n/n!) to the complex numbers. 1:49 e^(i*pi) multiplying itself by i, which opens a door to the... imaginary realm? Also alludes to the fact that Orange is actually in the real realm. How can Orange get to the quantity again now?  2:12 Repeated subtraction of (-1)s, similar to what was done with the naturals. 2:16 Negative times a negative gives positive. 2:24 Multiplication, and an interpretation of it by repeated addition or any operation. 2:27 Commutative property of multiplication, and the factors of 12. 2:35 Division, the final arithmetic operation; also very nice to show that - and / are as related to each other as + and x! 2:37 Division as counting the number of repeated subtractions to zero. 2:49 Division by zero and why it doesn't make sense. Surprised that Orange didn't create a black hole out of that.  3:04 Exponentiation as repeated multiplication. 3:15 How higher exponents corresponds to geometric dimension. 3:29 Anything non-zero to the zeroth power is 1. 3:31 Negative exponents! And how it relates to fractions and division. 3:37 Fractional exponents and square roots! We're getting closer now... 3:43 Decimal expansion of irrational numbers (like sqrt(2)) is irregular. (I avoid saying "infinite" since technically every real number has an infinite decimal expansion...) 3:49 sqrt(-1) gives the imaginary number i, which is first defined by the property i^2 = -1. 3:57 Adding and multiplying complex numbers works according to what we know. 4:00 i^3 is -i, which of course gives us i*e^(i*pi)!  4:14 Refer to 3:49 4:16 Euler's formula with x = pi! The formula can be shown by rearranging the Taylor series for e^x. 4:20 Small detail: Getting hit by the negative sign changes Orange's direction, another allusion to the complex plane! 4:22 e^(i*pi) to e^0 corresponds to the motion along the unit circle on the complex plane. 4:44 The +1/-1 "saber" hit each other to give out "0" sparks. 4:49 -4 saber hits +1 saber to change to -3, etc. 4:53 2+2 crossbow fires out 4 arrows. 4:55 4 arrow hits the division sign, aligning with pi to give e^(i*pi/4), propelling it pi/4 radians round the unit circle. 5:06 Orange propelling himself by multiplying i, rotating pi radians around the unit circle.  5:18 Orange's discovery of the complex plane (finally!) 5:21 The imaginary axis; 5:28 the real axis. 5:33 The unit circle in its barest form. 5:38 2*pi radians in a circle. 5:46 How the radian is defined -- the angle in a unit circle spanning an arc of length 1. 5:58 r*theta -- the formula for the length of an arc with angle theta in a circle with radius r. 6:34 For a unit circle, theta / r is simply the angle. 6:38 Halfway around the circle is exactly pi radians. 6:49 How the sine and cosine functions relate to the rotation around the unit circle -- sin(x) equals the y-coordinate, cos(x) equals to the x-coordinate. 7:09 Rotation of i to sin(x) allows for visualization of the displacement between sin(x) and cos(x). 7:18 Refer to 4:16  7:28 Changing the exponent by multiples of pi to propel itself in various directions. 7:34 A new form!? The Taylor series of e^x with x=i*pi. Now it's got infinite ammo!? Also like that the ammo leaves the decimal expansion of each of the terms as its ballistic markings. 7:49 The volume of a cylinder with area pi r^2 and height 8. 7:53 An exercise for the reader (haha) 8:03 Refer to 4:20 8:25 cos(x) and sin(x) in terms of e^(ix) 8:33 This part I do not understand, unfortunately... 9:03 Refer to 5:06 9:38 The "infinity" gun expands the real space (which is a vector space) by increasing one dimension each time, i.e. the span of the real space expands to R^2, R^3, etc. 9:48 log((1-i)/(1+i)) = -i*pi/2, and multiplying by 2i^2 = -2 gives i*pi again. 9:58 Blocking the "infinity" beam by shortening the intervals and taking the limit, not quite the exact definition of the Riemann integral but close enough for this lol  10:17 Translating the circle by 9i, moving it up the imaginary axis 10:36 The "displacement" beam strikes again! Refer to 7:09  11:26 Now you're in the imaginary realm.  12:16 "How do I get out of here?" 12:28 Don't quite get this one... Says "exit" with 't' being just a half-hidden pi (thanks @user-or5yo4gz9r for that) 13:03 n! in the denominator expands to the gamma function, a common extension of the factorial function to non-integers. 13:05 Substitution of the iterator from n to 2n, changing the expression of the summands. The summand is the formula for the volume of the n-dimensional hypersphere with radius 1. (Thanks @brycethurston3569 for the heads-up; you were close in your description!)  13:32 Zeta (most known as part of the Zeta function in Analysis) joins in, along with Phi (the golden ratio) and Delta (commonly used to represent a small quantity in Analysis) 13:46 Love it -- Aleph (most known as part of Aleph-null, representing the smallest infinity) looming in the background
It’s so. Holy  satisfying I’ll wanna watch this alot
No puede ser que con esto haya aprendido mas Matemáticas que en la escuela
That was the best math presentation i've ever seen in my 14 year studing 💯
10% de 1000000 de QI
That was basically a Death Star
I like how phi Φ moves in a golden ratio xD
Simple just multiply it by zero .....
Bro just made math Anime
hey alan I have an idea but I don't know if you agree with my idea that you make your movie because I already have the story and the new characters but you need marvel, sony, columbia, the creators of one punch man and the creators of spider-man across the spider verse and you can create your own company. Yes or not this is in your hands
Somehow, this video made me understand math more than some teacher, like now I understand why 0/0 don’t work
‏‪10:55‬‏ The best short film I've ever seen in my life, I even got goosebumps
Interesante.

That was remarkable... I actually want to learn more about maths to understand all of this now. I mean, I probably won't, but I want to
Wowwww this is ingenious!! Love it
200/10
Insanely cool. I hope I knew all the Math shown in the movie. Just like spending a lot more hours after the first watch of the Matrix movie in 2000 to understand the movie, I'm going to spend a lot more hours to understand some Math in this movie I don't know at the moment. Copy pasting a comment from an YouTube user named @wittyboy1009 with all the Math topics shown in the movie.  0:07 introduction to numbers 0:11 equations 0:20 addition 1:24 subtraction 1:34 negative numbers 1:40 e^i*pi = -1, euler's identity 2:16 two negatives cancellation 2:24 multiplication 2:29 the commutative property 2:29 equivalent multiplications 2:35 division 2:37 second division symbol 2:49 division by zero is indeterminate 3:05 Indices/Powers 3:39 One of the laws of indices. Radicals introcuced. 3:43 Irrational Number 3:50 Imaginary numbers 3:59 i^2 = -1 4:01 1^3 = -i = i * -1 = ie^-i*pi 4:02 one of euler's formulas, it equals -1 5:18 Introduction to the complex plane 5:36 Every point with a distance of one from the origin on the complex plane 5:40 radians, a unit of measurement for angles in the complex plane 6:39 circumference / diameter = pi 6:49 sine wave 6:56 cosine wave 7:02 sin^2(θ) + cos^2(θ) = 1 7:19 again, euler's formula 7:35 another one of euler's identities 8:25 it just simplifies to 1 + 1/i 8:32 sin (θ) / cos (θ) = tan (θ) 9:29 infinity. 9:59 limit as x goes to infinity 10:00 reduced to an integral 11:27 the imaginary world 13:04 Gamma(x) = (x-1)! 13:36 zeta, delta and phi 13:46 aleph
Make more pls i'm beging you pls pls plsssssssss

Alan… You and your team never cease to surprise me, these animations are so creative and fun to watch, I was here for the premiere and I can remember every moment that blew me away, either by complexity or simply being fun to watch. Incredible job, team!
That battlecry has to be one of the funniest things in this video.
Its multilevel more interesting if you actually understand maths.
I can't understand the clip 3:22
now Animation vs. History
intresting
It's amazing...
Alan you can make a animation of terraria ?
Amazing
uhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu awesomeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i loved!!!!
I give up school

orange made a sar wars ship! :o
So cool！
As a high school student I requeste you to make separate videos on chapters, so we can visualize this war in our class room .
This. Is. 🔥.
Es increíble como este sujeto hace que veas un vídeo de matemáticas complejas sin aburrirte :)

Who knew math could be so lit? I'm loving it! 😁
You explained math in my favorite way.
I 존나 NEVER WHATCH SUCH A THIS MASTERPIECE 시발 존나 I LOVE YOU
@FajrulFx
well done alan
BE HONEST NOW. ARE YOU A GENIUS???
This is a SO good animation and it has so much knowledge worth of math. It is very sad for me that my class didn't like this math animation or the effort.... :( But the teacher does. :)
schools should start using this as a introduction for kids to show how fun maths is.
😮😮👏👏👏

Alan Becker U MADMAN WOW!!!!
Phew, every JS dev knows that 1 + 1 = 11.
I’ll study hard until i can understand this formila Thanks alan
Bro a simple math become epic
Ohh bro it's really amazing.. I'm math teacher and I hope if I really can make more videos like this.. Make my students like math.. 🤩
Bro what the hail.
super
yeah, you lost me at 8 min
epic
👍
I updated the tab and saw that a million were added to the number of views🗿🗿🗿  Alan ( actually untitled Alan's animator ), gud job.
Esta mejor que una película de Disney
THIS IS AWESOME!!!!
WOW!One "1+1" becomes what magic things
that's fantastic
If only our math can be played like this, i would dedicate myself to it.. whether im dumb idgaf. As long as i can play with numbers and such like this

❤❤Just got to know about the video. And after seeing that really i am speechless. What a beauty of mathematics!...This is amazing...not understanding all the concepts but really getting interests as a beginner of bsc mathematics student.❤❤
This is the power of mathematics :D
damn
Very cool, it reminds me of made up lego wars that almost everyone who's into legos usually does. Great animation
Hai Alan. Can you do a match between animation vs physics
SO FUCKING COOL
11 milhões de visualizações em 5 dias? Sensacional . Utterly delightful!.
I just got flashbacks to my mechanical design college math classes.
you read this by calculator

Animation vs Kirby??? the author please note!!!
Bro in this video is math in a different Lvl  😮
My life's fruitful 14:02
А все началось с батута
😔😔😔😔
As an engineer, i absolutely every bit of this masterpiece! I request to share it under your banner, my king
Not me I hate school
This went from 0 to infinity real quick
Just Beautiful!!!
math is now satisfiying
I don't have words😭😭😭
good video but math still sucks
How did this teach me math more than my math teacher
I love this so much
you inspire me to learn math
After years of studying and woking in engineering, this the best math explanation that I ever seen
What's the logiciel you use for animation
Alright..  That was qas awesome
I love your vids!
Mortal Army 🪖❤❤❤
1=1×100÷12 ÷2×114
Youtube is here wooo
This makes me understand mathe 😂
pov: nerds solving the math questions
The level of Epic just TO MUCH @_@
Love how of the 5 symbols, aleph (א‎) is the largest one. Makes sense, because it represents the cardinality of infinite sets. Really cool, Alan!
Learning raidus and diameter has to be the worst thing in math.
hardest subject math
My head gonna explode when I foudout all of these
Damn bro this is an award winning animation 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love your vids alan i really like the storyline and animation of the characters
Who came here from mortal's broadcast channel 👍
So...This isn't easy math¯\_(ツ)_/¯
can you help me with my math homework
animation vs meth
The fact that a stickman knows more math than half of the people watching this is awesome Alan never disapoints us
8:22 things just got out of hands
All 11 classes of maths in 14 minutes
What was at the last? The giant one? 🤔
looks sleek !
I want alan to be my math teacher
N boss fight
Everybody else: hehehaha maths Me: *Menacingly waiting for him to break the fabric of reality with cardinals bigger than infinity*
Average math problems
Круто
My brain hurts
Alan Becker matematik çalışıyor

Waiting for Part 2
One of the best videos I have ever seen. I am watching youtube for about 10 years and I have almost subscribed 10000 chanells. But this is the best thing I have ever seen.. Hats of to your creativity man.. ❤❤
Alan I cant believe this master piece started from a trampoline time lapse I mean like what the heck
Alan you are my favorite youtuber, you spend all these hours on the computer to create these spectacular animations for us, you are the best❤️
Thank you, I passed the exam
Thanks man with this video I understood now why we can't divide a number by 0 and why it gives Error on a calculator because the 0 would go infinitely 2:49 this thing always kind of bothered me
Now im waiting for a game with concept like this.
so that's how math was created
🧠
I would like to see Animation vs Physics later.
Maths is Fun
i would totally play the game if it was made, absolutely amazing. Rewatched many times
Man if math was like this in school, I would have paid more attention lmao  Amazing job to everyone involved in this!
Utterly delightful!
I need a series or a movie of this wonderful animation. Please make this happen.
... but where did T S C  go? it was verified he was not at the right place looking for its home.
I'm even more afraid of maths now, was maths always this dangerous
what is the name of the music in the video  0:15
This is literally my new favorite video on YouTube!
Can't help but download the game and saved it to recall calculus lessons during college years which made me really cried out loud.
Cool
Never thought he’d end up fighting Euler’s identity.
Bro teached the math
Euler hates this video.
Complex numbers appearing like a Disney channel actor in another show
Now this is art!
Ok, i thought this is gonna be some boring educational stuff...  It turns out to be more than fire...
Bruh, I love math
Allan becker you help in producion  in the game shadow of the colossus is my favorite game
This video makes me crazy😆🤓😜😵🤙🤡
Not even kidding, this literally made me cry in the end 🗿
basically incredible can't say less about it. As an engineer student I enjoyed it
1=cosø+isinø
Like if 1 + 1 = 3
I have learned more in 14 minutes than 14 years
this stick figure could solos goku
such a masterpiece! keep up the great content!
Oscar incoming
Damn,so Match can be so cool 😂
What do i think about, instead of doing my math assignment:
animation is hard. math is hard. Imagine the pure time and effort, not just frame by frame animation but all the equations and notes that went into matching the logic behind  a story about fighting and fricking mathematics.
[] \/   100=100 an e
I can feel my brain expanding watching this video over and over
OMG! I have not seen anything like that!😮❤
The way he made ak-47 was damn man
If this was math in real life it would be the best subject
Mine too
I think this is the coolest thing I have ever seen
This is one of the best video i ever saw in my life 😮
"Mathematics is the gate and key of all sciences..." ~ Roger Bacon
How can you do that?
that's how math was invented
Amazing creations
Make a pt2 pls
O engraçado é eu estar assistindo isso na escola 😂
Why can't I favourite this
1+1=57
It seems like just mathematics on what you can do with it. dude this is cool
WAITING FOR PART 2
no way. The chosen one is now can destroy a universe of infinite size. Maybe is EVEN MORE with math
This was amazingly insane!!
Bro make a time mechanic in just 1 min with math Now im gona do math
12:15 this broke my heart i don't know why 🥲
There was a certain point that I have lost track.... Some strange elvish i couldn't read xD
do you rememeber UI=262?
1+1=2
bro has teached me all about math
Huge math nerd here, I'm only halfway through and this has been exhilarating to see. As a software dev who's been diving into VR the last few years, I can't help but think that this is a great concept for more "tactile" manipulation and exploration of mathematical expressions in a virtual environment.
Это прекрасно,я даже прослезился серьезно. Респект тебе и другу.
I loved everything, the epic fight scenes, the references, also the fact that everything was correct from a mathematical standpoint. Also loved how the imaginary numbers just dissappear xD
Make animation vs philosophy
I am truly lost at 11:12 🥲..  Edit: it was somewhat understandable later on..  But daammmnn! This was such an emotional and beautiful story 😭 Amazing detailing (though my brain can't capture most of it🥲)!!!!!!
เก่งจังวะ
The most logical fight ever
This is me doring maths exam
that's brilliant ❤️
im stupid now
bro learned mathin 8 minutes
if alan becker became a math professor and an animator in college 😂
What is 999 ×992 is multiplication is still math anyone guess it
So good
My head during my math exam:
This video was f*cking crazy
I love the end
jesus please stop this giving me an a colossal head ache [but tbh you did a great job animating this ]
🔥🔥
extremely cool ❤
Wow
how is it possible that you made math seem cool?
amazing video, you are a ganious man. congratulations🤩
This is just awesome !! 😍😍👌🏼👌🏼 One of the best visualisation I have seen recently !! Thank you !!
I interpret this learning math by deduction vs learning math by formula
This is something beyond
When someone says that he likes action movies and math, I will show him this
a pity that yellow isn't here, he would've loved this
Idk how the second one is smart like this
alan becker makes a friday night funkin animation video
I hate math but this is the best math video in my life
If they put this in the new VR tech or even a minimum multiplayer game all the kids are going to love math class
13:46 למה יש פה אלף??
The straight lines from this Animation plane just busted the shpere of my eyeballs and expanded the volume of my brain .   just loved it ❤
Amazing
I don't understand math, suck at it and hate it but now I love π and it makes me hungry
This is brilliant! 🙌
10:55 this math shall know pain
No wonder 3B1B videos take so long to come out. Is this what what Grant has to deal with every time he puts e in one of his clips?
Wow wtf 🤯
Not only am I impressed with this animation, but also the equations shown are valid and consistent. I'm so glad to be an engineer.
Who needs school when you have this?
Its fantastic!!
Perfection
The fact it went from 1+1 to idk what it is, is very amazing
green with chemistry
You, sir, just won the internet. Thank you for this masterpiece.
I tricked my teacher to put this on she actually thought this was a animated math video
This will be a timeless masterpiece.
What a masterpiece!!! Incredible!
can the next avm shorts plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz be about bedwars!????? pllzz?!
i wanna see mathematicians solve this one
WoW
א
Math and animation!!! Thak you for good content!
Math paid off
Animation vs English🤷
I'm completely speechless
Aw man, if only i knew that much mathematics i would get an A++ on my math exam/test
Please you upload vidio animation vs alphabet
😍😍😍😍😍😍
did he just...
SR(Square Root)-1=i😎
How about you start a hole season , because it is an S rank beginning.  I hope that Orange will fight the X some day , it will be legendary.🎉🎉🎉❤
Best video I have seen in my life
imagine how intresting school would be if it was THIS interactive
Bro was doing math to Whole whole new level 😂
11:33 Severe Brain Damage Slows Down
E rush?
No es como que haya entendido mucho, pero amo estás animaciones
Oh
It is amazing, I will show this to my students, this animation has a great potential.
This is the type of content i like
Now I feel dumb because of this
Hey alan becker you turkish.
7:33 Villain's e iπ Upgrade
The way I can look at this and not get bored of math cause it's protrated like this is something else. Alan can make  math or any school subject look fun and something cool to learn! Awesome!
What actually happened to the stickman?
You should do this for each branch.
7:01 is the middle of the video
THIS IS SO FREAKING COOL
Should used googolplex
now dippid should voiceover this
Mình có con 4 tuổi rất thích video này, mong ad ra thêm nhiều video hữu ích như thế này nhé! Cảm ơn bạn đã tạo video!!
This is every math nerd's fantasy, thank you for making it a reality <3
math is so easy 9+5 is 15
This is what it feels like when you solve a calculus problem after hours.
its just... incredible!!! i have a question, does the second coming going to still know about math in the future videos??? it should be incredible
So does this prove that TSC has incredible Math Intellect?
Man 😱😱😱 mind blown to imaginary levels... Wow
well at least I can study math form this video, and i like it.
You're amazing on this level of content ❤
next espode?
I made it a point to see the whole video after having a small glance of the same on insta. This was honestly one of THE BEST works of art and math that I have seen in a long long long TIME. 📈🔥🔥 EVERY SINGLE THING, right from the number and equation introductions we're actually shown having characters and a soul. Use of weapons with math, it's just incredible.  Watch this in your headphones. The effect is incredible nearing the climax. Math was mathing real hard and moreover, the animation had a drive to it. Lot of story going on. Never really thought I'd get to the edge of my seat after watching a couple of numbers doing crazy and bizzare stuff. Amazing.    Keep going mahn. We need more of this❤️✅
14:02 nice video
Bro literally defined reality using math😂
So creative ❤️
Someone explain this pls🙏...
Stickman worst nightmare
When mathematicians 1v1 each other.
blackpenredpen like this
Yoooo can we turn this into a video game? I'm a teacher and I think kids would looooove this
next video:  Programming vs Animation
Ya all, if you agree with youtube *math is now my favorite subject* Math gets harder when in higher grades.
It's the video i ever seen❤❤❤❤❤
1+1=7
E : hmm you play me like that? Well let me make a super big meck that can destroy you
animation vs BFDI 🤓
How to learn math in the right way
You should make more of these single character episodes but with the other stickmen like yellow or blue
This is an absolute master piece! I can not imagine how much effort was put into this work. To watch TSC discovering all the math operations and their analytical properties  feels like reliving math studies in most exciting way. I already see me rewatching several times in order to discover every small reference to known formulas. Love how all the abstract math symbols in the end leave to live together in peace :)   It is incredible how Alan manages with every video to step up even more. Please somebody give this man and his team all the awards they deserve!
At first I didn't understand, and at the end neither
We needa get animation vs science next,
this guy need oscar
Oh Logaritma FP 😮
É incrível como Alan Walker pode ser fazendo animações com simples sticks, as histórias que ele cria é sensacional, e essa da matemática me ganhou dms, até me reforçou querer fazer faculdade de matemática, é incrível a matemática muitos não gostam mas não sabem o qual lindo ela é, você é incrível Alan, continue assim já faz anos que vejo seus vídeos e muitas pessoas tbm continue Alan esperamos mais obras primas suas pela frente ❤
This is Freaking Good ... Like DuDe Ur freaking GOOD ... U GOT ME ( a major math loser ) googling math symbols and trying to find answers to formula just to follow the story .... Wow u Def need an Oscar for a Short film ... 🎉🎉🎉 Awesome man...
Subscribing wasn't an option, it was survival
This is goated this is why I love math fr
need more❤
Сделай оранджему посох пжпжпж заметь
Now I understand what my teacher meant by Playing with Maths.
He doesn't need an Oscar. Oscar needs Him😳
Don’t say 2+2 is 5 that a different story
Jenius🙏
This is what algebra feels like.
Alternate title: me fighting with my maths exam
0:57 nice
Much better than my math teacher
Hey! I found some error on this video! When Orange draw circle, the virtical line was i but horizontal line was 1!
tbh i dont even know whats happening because im so bad at math but this is cool af
I can’t understand wt* is meant
Only if maths was teached by this guy no student would ever fail in maths😅
This was incredibly clever and well made, congrats !
1+1=2
truly a love letter to mathematics !
Now I know why math can be powerfull weapon.
Oh my gods this was AMAZING! The animation was so clean, and the sound design absolutely sold it.
Now I'm scared on how much math medals this guy got in school...
جزء الاول كان مفهوم تماما الجزء الثاني جعلني ارغب في دراسة الرياضيات لفهم مالذي يجري ،هذا رائع حقا مضت فترة طويييلة جدا من اخر مرة شاهدت فيها شيئا جعلني ارغب في دراسة رياضيات اعتقد منذ 20 سنة على الاقل . شكرا جزيلا على هذا العمل الرائع
I also fight with my math in real life .I WANT TO PLAY MATH GAME LIKE THIS.THEN SO I CAN BECOME A MATH MASTER .😅😂😂😅
When u are passion about art but ur parent want you to be Engineer
keren banget brooooo!!
10:02 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
As an engineer I felt orgasm
7:56 THATS SHINRA TENSEEEI
Watching Alan Becker since childhood
Every mathematician's nightmare  be like:
Programming be like:
This is my maths motivation.
I have never seen such a good stickman video
alan becker make kirby vs animation
Our math teachers need to teach us like this!
‌
where is jerome..???
*the numbers mason what do they mean!*   man this was so rad, i'll post this in some discords i'm in if wasn't already! math was my worst subject too.
All time fav Video ❤
this was better than a 3 hr movie.
Bravo Alan 👍

i wish it could be like a game
Abi ben anlamadım.
This semi motivates me to actually pay attention in math class.
Your lead animator got a literal 200 IQ
If math were **this** cool, I would be a professor by now
Wait... I'm confused... Is O dead ?
Please make a video on little alchemy please

I'm not good at math so can someone tell me what the large symbol was at the end?
This is BEYOND WORDS.

underrated
Epic
Amazing 🔥🔥
오렌지는 수학 신
This man is a genius to succeed in pulling this off
math is pretty cool i guess
BUT HONESTLY SPEAKING. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SOUND EFFECTS ITS TOP TIER HOLY.
math can make you blast earth
I use to fear complex number but while watching this I remembered. .. While doing it fist time I liked it and still can do it ...thanku
9:56 argh that animation with the integral is sooo satisfying
11:04 I WOKE UP IN THE NEW BUGATTI 🔥🔥🔥
math is now my least favourite subject.
9:45 me typing the most random things in my calculator when I am bored and how I imagine it to be.
Alan Becker am your biggest fan and keep the videos up😃!
That's so beautiful to see 😭
This is beyond good
Thank you for bringing out the emotions of intrigue and discovery in such a beautiful way. I expect this will go down as a major contribution to the field, and maybe beyond. I cannot wait to see how you'd express other endeavours: physics, art, literature, philosophy.. what a masterpiece!
crazy....
this is impressive
Yo how did this man make math into weapons for war
the best movie
e
Choose one, You ur math teahcer, Or Alan Becker.
e^(pi*i): TEN THOUSAND YEARS--
you deleted it 😨
Euler's number hates animation😂😂😂
Super 👍👍👍
That is officially my favorite animation, I absolutely love it. Excellent job !!!
😢😢
creativity😍
Now I want a playable version of this
i dont understand math but after that i thing i understand everything  or IDK fr
That's how they all became excellent
This is already a heritage of humanity
I ENJOYED EVERY SECOND OF IT! Mashallah It Was So Good!!
Best educational video
Get This Man An Oscar Literally...
Don't Convince Me To Like Maths Man Pls I Had Enough Of That In School 😢
Best video I have seen in a extremely long time
Super amazing 👏
😮
That little guy be like: Until we meet again, you better learn math. Stickman: bet
@Bang Jerome harus lihat ini🤔
I've always Hated Math so much so I've almost took Commerce as my major, but after watching this Masterpiece I started to See the beauty in Math. Thank You Alan. thank you..😌
Awesome
❤
this vid made my math good                                                                                                                                  jk I bad at it I keep got score 60-90 only got 100 3 times and sometimes got 20-50 score
How Interesting it is 🤩
e. ee. eeeeeee. ee, e.
That was FANTASTIC! Easily top ten youtube videos for me. Just finished a differential equations class and a linear algebra class last semester, and it made math fun again. Thanks alan and team!!!!
Great work
Most powerful mathematical guns ever created.
Great Alan Becker!!!! you are the best!!!! <3!!!!
Wow, this masterpiece make my math teacher tear up❤
So fu#king satisfied and...teach me some of it ily brother
Я один русский?
Math Lore
This video is really showing the beauty of fundamental math nature. Brilliant.
Props to whoever did sound effects
Can't believe someone finally went and animated what goes on in our heads during math class as kids
Alternative title:The Second has been Albert Einstein for 14 minutes
15:45 freind
Will this be on the test, professor?
Minecraft wither Strom please
You are a genius!! The kind of teacher everyone needs to understand (and love) this non intuitive world. I know some math professors will use this!! Thanks so much!!! I hope someday physics appears here too.
Try out
Never been entertained and learning the same time in my whole life.
I'm impressed by the amount of creativity you have, honestly I could never have come up with this
look at the end
😂😂😂 bro covered all the math concepts I learnt in A'LEVEL...
Это точно талант!
I can't wait to introduce this to my friend who loves maths tmr
The fights are useless for this type of animation, but he manages to make them cool awesome and and amazing at the same time. Thats why i like your animations
люди: математика сложная; Математика:
Hey, I thought Numberphile will watch this and make a video about it.
I don't get it, i was bad in math
Bro what happens if r=absolute infinity:)?
This the best one of animation and I love to see more of ur great work
i feel like there could be a part 2 because of the stuff at the end i feel like orange guy would tell the rest of the color gang about that math verse 🤔
I think math is interesting!
9:39 I fucking love this part!! Linear algebra!!
What about Animation vs science
14 minutes and 2 seconds Long video. What did I learn? That 1+1 is 2.
THE MAN HIMSELF IS BACK!!!
Man really the best yt video I have ever seen. The attention to detail I really awesome. Really thoughtful and energetic...... You did a perfect job in executing this video......Really amazing 💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Is this highschool's math
i dont uinderstand the most powerfull
INTEGRAL STAFF INTEGRAL STAFF INTEGRAL STAFF INTEGRAL STAFF INTEGRAL STAFFFFFFFF
Я не говорю по английски но ето очень круто 🆒
What the. teachers mean when they say "math is power"
As someone whose favorite subject is math, this was amazing. You somehow made a fight scene with math. How do you even achieve that. Nah but that was sick as hell! Easily my favorite video of yours now
Orange is a human calculator 🧡
bro i think this guys is going on movie
Nerds: AvM= Animation vs Minecraft Chads: AvM= Animation vs Math
So THAT'S why we need Trigimonimology!
Math needs an oscar☠️
Listen, I don’t understand any of this… but I think this is cool af.
this is like another variant of "history of the entire world, i guess". it's both highly entertaining and educational.
Algebra VS mathematics. Cool.
Superb Animation What A Concept 🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
I hope that teachers show this to their students upon occasion. It looks like it has the potential to inspire some students to explore math on their own. Congratulations to the entire team responsible for this video. I'm convinced that this may be amongst the best math animations ever produced.
There genius ofrece mathematics. Thanks for all, is beautiful
stick man's maths is beter then human's maths
yes
*HERMOSO MUCHAS GRACIAS 🍸🇨🇱👍*
wait is that youtube its self
Orange made math so much harder now 😂
Bro explains math better than my math teacher 💀💀
Animation guys now have their own world physics and math natures. Perfecto.
Ohh thats the answer of 1+1 , so in school we wrong?😅
That was...beautiful, thank you very much!
My favourite part is 10:33
I understood the whole thing which made it even more amusing.
The second coming managed to become a nerd in 14 minutes and 2 seconds while I can't even do basic math
Ahh! I'm watching is again and again, still not getting bore...#masterpiece
I can just imagine a bunch of math equations coming for the stickmin team( red,blue,yellow,green and tsc/orange) and they have to solve it in time lol
This is Epic, i can imagine someone not liking this.
i have no words for this mannn. this thing was just out of the world. what a smooth and clean animation + the maths u had to know for making this. hats off
5:42  6.283 is πx2 a.k.a τ
i didn´t get any of the video past some point, but still cool tho
as a person who’s bad at math i still confirm that this is definitely the coolest thing i’ve seen in a while
Effective communications and narrative
I failed in math exam, now I got a very funny interesting reason to study hard again😅😅
Btw I don't care if it's considered malware!!!!
This should be part of the AvA lore because it would make sense right. He's paused in the real and stuck in his own mind trying wake up and figure out things
Can I have a blue? Like for real.
Tool´s videocli be like:
Thanks!
I love your idea about every animation you do. Please can you keep up the good work you know what I don't even need to ask you that because I know you will. I will say this again you animation  is amazing and I know how long this take also if I had to give you a 1 thorough 5 I would give you a 5.😊
My teachers should watch this
AI
great
I think i learned math from this
Esta genia. la canción y el video tambiéon
weird thing is i still understood all of those equations and math even after all these years, WHERE WAS THIS KONDA LEARNING WHEN WE WERE KIDS
Make a stop motion vid :D
eiπ
6:45  ummm Cos looks like A Hammer!😮
Amazing video!
That was cool and awesome
So we can get Animation vs Physics after this?
Wonderful
I didn't knew bro would cook like that
Никогда так эпично не изучал математику
Now it's official: math is beautiful
That boss at the end was a darksouls type boss 💀
Orange stickman math skills: 99.9%
where's the-end
O MY GOD. IT'S JUST FANTASTIC
who likes math comments here
This animation showed to me to not underestimate any math problems anymore! LMAOOOOO
Would love to see a numberphile analysis video on this masterpiece
Ok, matemática é minha materia favorita apartir de agr
Every math teacher should show this animation masterpiece to their students
Bro we have got to have a Math vs Animation series because this just looks epic😎💪
This visual maths was so fun and interesting to watch . I wonder how easy math will become when we will actually  start learning maths this way!!❤...and Alan what a genius u r , never seen a animator like u..respect!!
RUSSIA SHUT UP
this is a great video
Next video: Animation vs Geography
AWESOME
Why is the WAA from the guy when he forms the titan math so adorable
Woahhhhh
£¥€§ le faltaron
Alan Becker is one of the best animators I've met.
millions of subs because of stickmen is crazy😂 bro found the cheat code……. but i do realize how much work this is tho
It's good to see you still making these masterpieces after all these years I'm watching you since I was a kid 🥹
13:02 who else thought E trapped him and wanted to shoot him before realizing “oh he’s just making a teleporter”
O cara fez matemática ser divertido
Wait he got a hold of infinity why didn’t he use it as much as pi? Maybe I just suck at math.
The fact that Alan can make MATH look incredible is something else
Good luck
this is so good in so many ways
Am I the only person who wants to see (Animation vs Combat gods),Now that would be a fight to see 🔥
This dude made Math epic, just incredible.
do you make a animation about the stickmans vs a other game? Because we want other video about a game. In this case, I suggested Undertale💀🌼🖥❤.
Wow es increíble :0000000
WoW, dice good.
Seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
julio profe lore
Animation Vs Learning series, maybe?! Next episode Green Vs. Music Theory
It's Just A Question, Its Not That Serious
As a recent graduate. This is really nostalgic for me... It started with class 1 and ended at a phd level. I literally got Goosebumps while watching this video and that sound effect really made the video experience 10000x times better.... Alan you are a genius.
I love this video  But i still hate math 😂😂😂
Dude went from Animation battling with a real person to Animation battling with math symbols and numbers. *I love it.*
can we all appreciate the fact that 1. the math here actually makes sense 2. that music is fire???
you are a magician in animation Alan Becker 👏
I don't usually comment but being a Maths major.. I can tell u this is best animation I have seen in my life..  Mad respect..❤️  Utterly  beautiful...❤️
This video was simply spectacular, incredible!!
Esse vídeo e o melhor do ano
There needs to be a part two this was so cool
math get harder
This one was very vrry good
This is probably the coolest maths video ever, so far.
Math teacher 😪😪😪😪 Alan beaker 📒📙📔📘📗📓😃👍🧠

Increible como se las ingenia par acrear nuevas animaciones con nuevos temas, increible sigue asi Alan!
No entiendo nada de esa matemática
La parte de la integral fue la mejor lpm, que buena animación
Que recuerdos brooooooooo😢
This video made me love math 💀
Thanks, Please teach me mathsssss
😑😑😑😑😑😐😐😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😑😑😑😑😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵 pero que rayos pasa con eso Alan Becker
verlo: 😀 hacerlo:🌚 entenderlo todo bien:💀
Es lo más épico q he visto
This is how I imagine math usually, that's why me and my friends would love math and it's incredible that alan and his team was able to visualize it and it's just absolutely a masterpiece. They're a living legend.
数字苦手すぎて何が起こってるのかはなんも分からんかったけどなんかすごいのは理解できた、面白かった。私みたいのでも視覚的に楽しめるのがすごいと思う。
Hmm, odd I don't see any minecraft blocks here...
That is by far one of the coolest things I've seen.
😨  E-
Fantastic! Congrats.
watching this video makes me think that maybe math can't be so boring after all
Finally!! Math 2
SO DAMN SMOOTH
we need a whole math series where orange teaches us math
Genial
"bro orange where were you" "oh nothing i was in a dimension purely for math, also i can weaponize math now" "oh"
Dios, te juro que este video es tan hermoso
Who knew that I would learn how to finally use negative exponents from this
I've never had saw something so beautifull and with the better thing possible: math. Alan thank you very much for every animations. 🤩🤩🤩🤩
i learned more in this one video then I did in 4 years of highschool math
Deberia haber una serie para esto
I enjoyed watching this❤
Wtf
es una alef  la del final ?
I hate every person who could think of giving a dislike to this video
HERMOSOSOOSSOSOSOOSOS
Animation vs physics ..... Much needed
🤯"literally"
🤯😲1000000000%

Animation vs phisic
How many numbers died for this animation exist?
incredible
This is my new favourite video
When I see mathematics at the beginning but at the end ☠️💀☠️💀
Very cinematic maths class.
Bro learned math in 15 minutes
Next up: Animation vs. Chemistry
Unbelievable
From 1+1 to fken integration towards infinity of an imaginary number powered towards infinity (infinity)(infinity)(♾️)
I'm scared now.
Animation vs Quimic
I need more of this
Idea: animation vs alphabet
Math has never looked so beautiful
Brutalmente genial.
The Second Coming somehow got stuck inside a calculator
Quite honestly the best video ive seen on youtube i think
this video is simply sublime, great!
Nobody did teach me like this to math
I passed my exam because of this
BRO TOOK MATH TO A ANOTHER LEVEL
And  os  er Umi
animation vs real life : good

Epickkkk😮❤
Gracias eres el mejor me acompañaste toda mi infancia dios te bendiga 😊
Math test be like:
EL profe de mate:  Tarea, haz un ensayo explicando el video de Alan Becker
Wow IS e
after seeing your stickmen tutorial and seeing a purple second coming, do you think we can also add that into the Animation vs Minecraft ep 32?
mucho texto.
If mathematics were like this, I would not stop practicing them 😂
Christopher Nolan presents “Maths”
Pretty damn Stunning...
i want a game just like this❤️❤️🫡
Eu me sinto agora muito inteligente depois desse vídeo
This is brilliant!
Nice videos I've been repeating this video
Bro. Come on. Make the second episode that orange go back to the math dimension to introduce the friends
I'm not very good at math, but I would like to study this subject next time.😎😎😎
🤓☝️❤️
I can say, math is complicated in all methods for me but this is more interesting than than the school... And their mode of teach to others 👏 congratulations you impress me with this.
SO SMART ❤❤❤
The+end is amazing

your old stickman videos remind me of what i dont have
Incredibly beautiful animation
3:50 Happy to see imaginary numbers and i as thats something I recently started learning this summer! Awesome dude manages to make me happy about math for once.
Stop mosion worm was in my recomenden well i thinck its recomenden
Math lore:
A stickman taught me math better than all my math teachers in my life in just 14 minutes.
it´s a magic
you can’t be amazing at animation AND EXPLAIN IT
You would have to have a masters in mathematics to understand what the hell is going on in this video
This masterpiece bring me the vibes of Tron movie 🤩🤩
This is a fantastic animation that gave me cool ideas of abilities, but I also wanna take a moment to compliment Egor because the sound design doesn't miss. It is *amazing*
This is just the better math bcs it looks cool and it's from alen becker
Give this guy a reward
I swear, this looks so satisfying!
I have absolutely no idea of what did i just watch, but i loved it!
오 먼가... 수학을 처음 발견하고 발명할때 이런분위기인가
Foi assim que a primeira pessoa descobriu a matemática
You need more maths knowledge then animation to do this video
this is amazing
8:34 and math is not useful for life  Pt: e matematica nao serve pra vida
You're the best
This is too fckn good
99+1=100
I never here
This is my imagination when I can't answer my math I always attack the math on my mind
Se lo tomo muy literal con lo de "el conocimiento es poder"
The fact that you showed us stuff that I thought can exist only inside my brain😅
I like this video
❤
this is a great video
This is the best video you ever made like for part 2
This is the best animation I’ve ever seen
The animation even better than a whole season 3 NNT
This is insanely cool.
The Alans
Man, imagine he made animation vs chess. Totally not that i like to play chess :))
So this is why math is super hard
you're genius
Welp my favorite Subject is Now Math :)​
if you make a movie it looks cool
ثالته ثانوي اجمع
From Transformers to Zelda BOTW, everything just lost their demand over this xD
all good but if you are going to include the ∞ you should have given it more power than imaginable because well it is infinite that is absolute
oh my god this is the best thing i've seen on youtube in the last year, PERFECT!!! ❤❤❤❤ Бл, это лучшее что я видел на ютубе за последний год!!!!
كل شيء بدأ من الرقم 1 omg
whos the big one at the end of the video?
I learned more in this video than i ever did in all of school
CALLING ALL CAPTIONERS CAPTIONS ARE ON!!!!  DO YOUR WERID CAPTIONING THING!
Amazing!
The end bro, he knows

Alan Becker = Albert Einstein II
with this video. i dont think i will need a math teacher anymore :)
Just WOW! MIND BLOWING. SUCH A NOVEL BRAIN! WHO COULD HAVE THOUGH THAT MATH COULD LOOK LIKE THIS INSIDE ONES HEAD.
The math all is legit, love it (also, aleph was looking a bit small today :) )
Bro taught me every math question
Richard Watterson playing calculator on hard mode
This is the smartest animation I have ever seen
Ah yes i understand this
Sincerely, Thanks for it!
Please make animation vs quantum mechanics
The next one should be: animation vs. JavaScript
debo haber aplaudido unas 4 veces durante miraba el video. Simplemente hermoso.
my brain hurts
Math professors be proud right now
Alan Becker is amazing
How math teachers think we’re gonna use math in life:
This is insanely cool. Not only it looks like a cool fight animation, it actually shows the origin of functions and concepts as TSC discover them. To be honest, I only understand the math up to ⅔ of the video, and still it felt very amazing. I can imagine how fascinating this is to people who understands all the math shown here.
I waited him make 0÷0
How teachers think maths will help us in life:
how to learn math in one video:
solo se metio a la calculador a de alan xddd
10 yo me doing my math homework Mom:Where did you learn all this? Me:
Oh man, now I want to learn more math just to do this haha
Hi
so Alan has done, simple Stick Figures, made them become Gods, made another be a Grand Artist and able to learn new things, made them learn about Minecraft, made them face Youtube itself, made them face other games like Mario, Pokemon, League of legends, Arcade games and now he's made one literally do maths... what next i wonder?
Danm orange you are the best
No it’s not
Baldi from Baldi's Basics be like: ,,Great job! That's right!''

This video proves that math is more fun and awesome than you think.
Laughing in Engineering maths! This is sooooo good!
Amazing allegorical interpretation of out development in math. knowledge. Superb!
Seria una buena idea poner esto en las aulas y jugar con las mates asi nadie o bueno siendo realistas la mayoria de la clase le justaria
1+1=2

how to learn math in 14mins.
the fact he's thinking about all of this because hes bored in jail though
Hooray for math! Awesome math!
I want to be an animator but I don't have a windows device so I can't use Adobe flash What other apps for android do you recommend and how many frames per second are you I am a big fan
We want animation in programming and coding!!!
TCS learns math faster than me 😂
3:15  3D 4D
This video and Aleph-0 by Optie will go down as legends

e^i(π)???
I hope I see this on the future so I can actually understand all that complicated equations. I love this animations please continue on doing.
Tau... where are you?
This is sick as hell. Good job to everyone involved.
Me encanto, la expresividad de los personajes aún sin hablar, la animación y las referencias matemáticas, todo perfecto
I can't even imagine the amount of genius, effort, and elegance dedicated to this work. You're special. Single best math animation story I've ever seen!!
It was perfect... down to the last bit!
too much math, maybe its time to learn sone
What is the music called?
You really did your math on this one
Wow, what a ride, this is beyond impressive! Math + great sound design + really smooth animations = 😍
So cool

What...
Gauss:
Bro i was teached more in one 15 minute video on youtube than 9 years of school
I just wanna say that this is literally how the eldritch truth is seen as. It makes sense, but if you aren't knowledgeable about the subject it looks completely alien and unfamiliar.
TRULY CREATIVE I'm speechless
I saw an explanation video of all the math references, this guy is not only a god of animating stick figures but has really good attention to detail and if he didn't know all this before he had the idea to make a video its even more amaizing what he made here
que mala onda la e
O vídeo tem apenas 5 dias de lançamento e já tem 11M 💀 felizmente sempre acompanhado o Baker desde as animações do Minecraft e os companheiros desse cabeça de cesta 😂😂
Epico simplemente Epico tanta creatividad
Trop bien
Wonderful
My dreams, after a night of preparing for a math exam:
Hola que buen video
Beep
Nice🎉
I analysed this video frame by frame an I am now invested in Mathematics, thankyou Alan Becker.
Maths 2
Thats like my favourite piece of media ever now. Thank you.
Always gonna love math, also got the math award for grade 8 grad
The Best video i have ever seen
Honestly i want to play a game now that lets you sand box math like this. Just giving you tools to quickly run through problems as well the ability to show your work rapidly
Amazing
I Alan Becker Make a stickman animation just for Minecraft
guys am i the only one who thinks e^iπ, delta, phi, zeta and aleph should get their own series?
13:37 i swear we need delta patting e^iπ for 10 minutes nonstop
A masterpiece this is 🔥💯
POV: me on monday math after eating sone mushrooms on the back desk
Noice😋
Nah man just passed 5 days and this video have 11 million of views
This is the best animation I have seen this year. Sure blew my mind when I started seeing them back in 2012
no entendi, me odiaran pero me aburrio tanta matematica
If you think about it, the animations about math are made out of math; not just ones and zeroes, but surely there were some shading tools calculating light in there!
What's next? Animation vs. Language
Zyada samajh nhi aaya par dekh kar acha laga
that is the best animation video i have ever seen thank you for giving us this video
math lore
This is what school should include
13? 🔞
arteeeeeee
this video is AMAZING!!
Odio matemáticas pero esto es épico
Math tests in a nutshell
Math has always been my favorite subject, now I know why.
bro learned calculus in 7 mins
amazing 😍
Gracias :)
By the way, it reminded me now of the birth of our universe: at first there was emptiness everywhere, then a big bang thundered and our planet appeared, water on it, then land, and only then life (I don't remember the order very much). Respect to the author if he took this into account in the creation of this video :)
This is too epic
l love your animations,
Great
absoluto 10 de 10 es epico
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRDDDD
Wait is the latter alef in the Hebrew language is math thing?!?!?!?!? DAMN YOU GOD!!!!!!
1+1
Nice!  Very clever.
10:00 "WAAAAAHHHHH" lol XD
Who needs calculus and trig? I got this
This sounds are so good dude
Bro knows all calculations dude can build a time machine do it akan 🤣❤️
pelan-pelan pak supirr
Math dark souls
If I was taught math like this…. I’d be an evil genius.
We need more but with higher level math
Imagination beats knowledge because it's limitless, just like mathematics.
Queme
Bro is famous now. Youtube commented💀
Mom: Stop watching YouTube! It's bad for your brain! My screen:
Math killed him
Power of math
rhinocerus
OH MY GOD??? as an asian this made chills go down my spine
Cara o conhecimento de matemática pra fazer isso deve ter sido e norme e ficou muito legal
All it took was number 1 And bro became 98 Albert Einsteins
what was the giant dark letter behind zeta and phi at the end?
The script is written in MATHS.
We need a game in this style.
i cant wait for the nuclear bomb sequel when they do 0/0!
Wanted - Animator vs. Animation VI - Ep 1?              --->          Wanted - Animator vs. Animation VI - Ep 2?
I Have no Words, This is Simply Perfection, like, How did you tell a story without words?
I like this
I had to take calculus and just seeing how all of the animation was mathematically sound was great
Te felicito espectacular el video que realizaste, el mejor que he visto hasta ahora, tendrás que hacer otro explicando algunas partes.
How come I am watching THIS cool video from back in  2006 right now!?!?
I’m literally going to be using this video as reference any time I learn a new math concept.
is really nice to see all these greek letters
Impresionante todo el conjunto de habilidades en un solo video. ❤
7:54-8:00 это реквием
Math is fun, isn't it?
I don’t have words to describe how it is amazing
This is AMAZING!
This is genuinely how it feels to go to a more advanced math class for the first time and find out all of the numbers you had no idea existed
Youtube: my favkrite subject is - Math! Me: I KILL THE MATH!
I have to show this video to my math teacher
This is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. However, with the memory of Calculus II still fresh in my mind, I shivered when I saw Sigma.
This is confusing
I'm slowly getting interested in math, I have to go get my book😂
I love how Orange randomly discovers e^(iπ), but the number escapes by using the complex numbers. Being randomly told that -1=e^(iπ) must feel exactly like that when they try to introduce you to the complex numbers: you found out a weird way to represent -1, but you'll have to wait until you've learnt the basics about it to use it again, which is exactly what Orange does: They discover π, the complex numbers, the sin and cos and so on until they understand e^iπ. Simply awesome
As entertaining as educational. Well done.
animation vs math 2?
master piece
Cuando te aburres en clases de matemáticas y tu mente empieza a divagar:
What are you using to make those videos?😊
The great videos make other YouTubers comment on them, but only the very greatest ones have the honor and privilege of having YouTube itself comment on them
i never comment on any videos on yt  but here i really have to give my time and say , it was great !!!  Like G.O.A.T.E.D ❤ even i learnt some new things from it
This was SO cinematic! Where do you take your sounds dude? 🔥🔥
hes back!
Imagine if someone made this a vr Game
It's shooting 4 w the bow like my math tests in highschool  I think between understanding math and actually solving analisi 2 is actually 2 different things It's fun to see how much my prof failed w passion in what they were doing :3  Very pog video  But we have black hole cluster guns and boomerangs in video games :)  the simplicity here in gun design kinda alarming ahah
Wow is amezing, good job!!!
fantasy video,epic
imagine having him as a teacher.
Imagine if: Animation vs Physics/Biology/Chemistry. That would be cool.
Omg what pro 😎
The Best animation about Mathematic <3 I was first time this focused about math :D
Can you create a more insane math battle?
so cute
What a beautiful piece of art!
Only 5 days and 11M views... It got viral...🎉🎉🎉 Congratulations Alan Becker
From windows XP to this... Damn❤
Please part2
ENTENDÍ TODO 😎😎
The coolest thing I have seen in my life is this video. Respect to Maths
Imagine a character with super power like this they can visually use math and physically touch the number as superpowers
Esta bonito
Khan Academy expectation:
Masterpiece. Our applauds to everyone involved. Petition for Oscar nomination.
The best mathematical animation video in the world.
Bro this in the end is the greek word the δ,ζ and the φ wow
I love this video
oh finnally i cnaget a nerd gf
Ало
bro, i just realised math is bigger than i thought 💀
All fun and games until that a in math turns into an e
this fucking stick has more iq than me
No clue if this is weird, or just me, but the segment with him figuring out the cos sin stuff and the radial circle... I feel like that taught me more about cos sin than math class did.
What a fun video, reminds me why I took so many applied math classes in sophomore
This is awesome! I want to hug you! You just made my day! It's beautiful! Congratulations! You deserve an applause from every viewer!
Is this the power of math? 🥶
These animations were my childhood
This is so cool
10:02 WÆÆÆHH
if only math was this interactive
if only math was this fun...
Best thing to come out of YouTube in quite some time
This.. The black void he's in made me think bro got trapped in a calculator! XD
Now who's gonna hate math!!..huh!!😂
how long does it take for you to make this????? this is fire
Next video animation vs alphabet
This hurts my brain
It's so cool, I love that
THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD, I love it!!!
who would play math the game?
e is SOOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
is this gonna be a series
I just learned more in the last 15 minutes than in the last 12 years of school
Pls make a video that the second coming eats warts plssss
I am a mathematics student and this illustration is so goood.. That's how mathematics works in the real world.
some thing you can't found it every day🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The best animator in the world 🌎 🎉
you had the chance to make a 9 plus 10 joke but you didn't and i'm so mad about it
animation vs. geography
YouTube?
What th-
The sound effects are so satisfactory to hear.
Damn is soooo goood animation
Topping poppings🔥🔥
Wow
Backrooms level √2 be like
bro I don't get ANY of this
nothing has  made math more interesting
Fans: Alan's videos are unstoppable these animations couldnt be any better Alan: oh yeah so then ill learn everything albert einstein and newton laws of math and make u learn math from my video as an animation
this is so goddamn clever
imagine if somebody just made this a whole math learning game. With good animation like this and unique ways on how symbols work. Like how the equal sign is a button.
The best ever YouTube video😮
Awesome Brooooooooooooo
animation vs math 2 pleaseeeeeeee!
You just made math cool
Vengo de Mates Mike
The animation styles really gave me a transformers vibe
Just incredible.
Incredible.
11 milhões de visualizações em 5 dias? Sensacional ❤
This is just pure mesmerizing eye candy.
I NEED A PART 2 (gasp)
kindly accept my 🏆
I’m not even joking… get this into an animated short film festival, because this could win an Oscar.
wow
Proof that math is the bad guy
Really loved it!
Amazing video, loved it
You lost me when alphabets starts to show up but amazing animation🥵🥵
The best animator of all times
Buenardooooo❤
Ig math can be fun after all
😵
Genial! Esto es arte puro.
Fantastic!
Did this video tell me all the properties of math in only 14 min??? using awesome animations??? NICE!  A dream come true.
man this is just so cool
I got the 1
don't mess with the chosen one!
This is why I love mathematics so much, I think it can be seen as a form of art in a way. Everything just works and makes sense. Awesome animation too!
let him cook
Finally, a video to top off the Congruent Angles - Neon Genesis Evangelion OP
My brain when my teacher asks me what’s 9+10
Math is like the best

You are a genius
He should try to make one of theese but it is about programing and coding or other subjects you learn in school.  I am really fond of the coding idea.😊😊
That was the coolest math lesson ever wtf
it will be cool if you create a game
someone smarter than me needs to make an interactive game where you can experement like this, please make this happen.
Legendary science fiction ....🤯🤯🤯🤯
alan que te fumaste? yo quiero de eso
Transformer=))))
what an animation
Please do for physics please
This is awesome!! However, I’m wondering, what are the impacts of this on the main lore of AvA? Like, where was TSC exactly? And where were the others? Aka Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. I’m really hoping for a part 2 of this! Or a series of some sort! Like I would love to see TSC dividing by 0 thus causing the universe to break or something!
Now that's a fun way to learn math!!!
If this video had come out earlier, I might have been able to avoid giving up on math... This video is just amazing!
So… who’s gonna send this to there algebra teacher to see how accurate it is
I didn't know half of what I just looked at but hell it was amazing
BRAVO!! BRAVO!! BRAVISSIMO!
Ich schik immer noch nicht Mathe
did anyone else notice that the music sounds like the one from roblox doors
cool moments when e block infinity shot with integration . since integration can hold infinity. Lots of references lots of cool stuff
What a true masterpiece!
Maht in school☠️ In Dream this vidio
just amazing
I wish to be teached math like that ;-;
diosmio es una de las mejores animaciones que he visto en mi vida, felicidades al autor
Best animation
lets talk about how TSC became smarter than we did in 12 years in just 14 minutes
Vector calculus, complex variable, trigonometry tutorial in single video 🙌 Exceptionally well done as always!!
Absolutely phenomenal!!! I always love what you do!!!❤
Wow match
now i love math
This is a realy good spectacle I like your concent

I love the transition at 9:57 into the integral staff it's just so satisfying somehow
Kudos to your hard work 👏
היה בסוף את האות א?!??!!!!?
Спасибо вам за годноту
Удивительно как из математики можно сделать эпичнейший сёнэн
ammm, ehhh, well, words! DAMN   🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
it takes math for a computer to compute what this video would be called.
better luck next time brother
this is my brain in math lesson
Это гениальный и фантастический шедевр
People think math is boring but after watching this video i realised math is fun and creative, abilities and intelligence ❤
That's what teachers see when telling that math is fun
This is actually teaching me a little math
I like your words magic man😀😀
I am a Maths teacher & will definitely going to use this video for teaching them.
Masterpiece

Better animation than boruto
Maravillosamente impresionante
A mí me encantan las matemáticas es mi materia favorita y en verdad me sorprende que Alan Becker hiciera este vídeo. Eres increíble Alan Becker. Saludos desde Venezuela.✌️
Для этой анимации ему пришлось стать гением математики💀
That is the best animation video I've ever seen!!
Please make..such video ❤❤❤
Do another one, now it could be Animation vs Reading or something like that. Only with another character 🤓  ￼
Brazil também é fã do alan
Im a nerd and this feels good🤓
if math was this interactive i’d do it more
He went from a regular animation to an entire movie! Keep it up Alan!
This maths exam looks quite off
It's fantastic, I understand
Im too young for all of this mathematic stuf
It’s an amazing work , but I didn’t understand math and I don’t understand😄
WOW     Sin palabras
So is this the calculation of teleportation?? 😳😳😳😳
Alan, you’re te boss. The G.O.A.T!!
y'know, this made me understand a teeny bit better what sin and cos are. Thanks! Also my god, the IMPACTS here! Animation-wise, this is just absolutely amazing. This gotta be the most well-animated sci-fi interface ever, seriously
@alanbecker where's your next animation vs Minecraft Season?
This just made math more cooler, this is nice 😎👍
I want Animator vs. Meth next
typical first grader
Loving the 3Blue1Brown update
I never thought a orange animated stick man would be better at learning math than me 😂😂😂
Guys know up to 512k now?
why don’t you multiply the boss with 0?
After years and years of studying math lore, we finally have seen math gameplay.
Masterpiece.....
This video didn't need to go so hard but it went beyond
0:00 start of video 14:02 aleph goes off-screen
Me watching this video: ha yes Headache
Bro made math even harder
aleph numbers are cool
Actually the most unique animations I’ve ever seen 👏👏
Bro really make math look fun
I need some math teacher to react to this and explain wtf is happening
Termineytor 6
As animações de Matemática são incríveis mas nos tem que aprender como se calcular e também como fazer soma. Mas valeu Alan Becker o vídeo ta uma nota 💯 você incrível👍.
Oh brother looks like we got a NERD over here! 😂🤦‍♂️🤮💀
Hey we need a part two on the animator vs animation VI PART 2
Learning to read
bro turned math into a full on war
Bro.... did he just figure out portal science?!!!!
א
As both an animator and an engineer, I appreciated this thoroughly.
1:39 well that escalated quickly
This video represents whats the human criativity can make.
the + end = theend
Is a letter fro Hebrew א The number
SUPER INTRESTING
Man used just only calculus to simulate a war between tech gods.
Bizmi matematiiianlamadadı
This is so cool man
ANIMATOR DON'T NEED OSCAR ,, OSCAR NEED THIS ANIMATOR  SERIOUSLY MAN WHAT A WORK YOU DONE !!! HATS OFF 😊😊😇🤩😍😯😯😲😲
So cute...
My dreams movie finally comes true❤️
why is there an hebrew letter?
As a Math graduate , this warms my heart.
El juego de Richard se hizo real
Me encanto entender mucho del video 😄
This is the best animation I've ever seen 🤩🤩
Mis respetos un gran trabajo.
Ngl this was awesome!!
I need more this thing
En efecto, son matemáticas 🚬

Outstanding Video
It will break the record.
im speechless im shocked im amazed, wow....... i can never see math same again like i used to be 👁👄👁
Bro Cool Music
this is just EPIC ART! my God! I love this video!!!
People master math after 40 years and this dude did it in 14 minutes👏👏
Anybody still Have their Brain inside your head in good condition.  This is a Kind of Ramanujam Thing. (The man who knew infinity)
Where can I find these sounds? 10:36 10:45
Incredible sound effects and background music how good they are!
I learned something new but with the cost of my sanity and some brain cells
Genial !
That's brilliant
Someone should use this for school
oh men its god
Words cannot describe how amazing this animation is. I hope someone good with numbers does.
Next video can Make the seccond coming use his math to defeat the guy that took the chossen one
👁👄👁
😒 ignoratn
bigger W than Lambert's function
If only math lessons could be THAT interesting and entertaining😢👍
My exam vs me B)
part 2 pls
dude really goes from negative 1 to e^(ipi) straight away
The second chosen one was like the God of math in just 14 minutes 😅😅

Can you do with all the stickman aka (yellow green blue red and orange?)
this is actually very educational video thank you man 🙏🏽
This guy teaches math more than my teachers 💀
"Animation vs. Science" please do
This is what is happening in our brain when we think to slove a math problem
& ٪ + @¶=؟
wow ts so cool!!!!!!!!!!
Alan can make a animation out of everything
It's boring
good job
Hi
Wow........
My favorit is math❤
I love it ❤❤
I want to make a game where it is oriented around math, and then this video was recommended. I want to make a game like this. The sound effects and the animations are just perfect 👌
Alepth sub zero at the end. Omg this is perfection
Idk why I’m just now wondering this but do the have names or are they just called their color?
A new way to learn math
Yall know what is the last giant symbol means? Ive seen it alot but dunno what does it mean, can yall teach me
You have an Extraordinary mind, and I genuinely respect it. ❤
Ur the only person i know that can create an action movie from math
14 minutos de genialidad. Desde Colombia full bacan.
This should be a real game
Animation vs Kirby?
What would have happened if I DIVIDED 0?💀💀💀
💖whoever is reading my comment god bless his family member's...🙏🥰👍

Thanks for this amazing and very entertaining video
Maravilloso, una obra maestra. Soy profe de mats y esto es una genialidad. Ojalá hubiera una segunda parte
interesujące
It is somehow reminds me Baba is you.
Khatarnaak😮😮😮
It's great how young viewers to learn maths
the sound design is so CRISPY!
This is absolutely fantastic !!!

Master peice
Rsc
far-far better direction than a 600 Cr. Project
can you make epic battle between infinity and stickman, that stickman looses but on end they become friends?
I didn't understand the end😢
Now with programming languages
The Game calculator
Thats a lot of Math. Amazing
So that's what those sin and cos tables were for....
if there was a game where i can make an random stickfigure that will be very interactive and will be able to do many things like your stickman...
Bro built a Death Star
its like a star wars movie XD
TSC didn’t eat pi like a pie 0/10
I didn't understand the final part, can somebody elaborate please?!
its like zombie apocalypse but more its e apocalypse
its like "Do you want  do you want  math math math math"
Only reason why I disliked this video, was because of to much ADS 👎👎👎👎  But overall, I did enjoy this video👌
Now i have new plan sin theta = 1 😎🤓
이게 예술이지
Imagine if he took a plus and a minus and poof they disappear
It's even more exciting when you understand them😂
Animation vs Brawl Stars please ❤❤❤❤
probably the most educational Alan Becker video we'll ever see, THIS IS HOW THEY SHOULD'VE TAUGHT US MATH IN SCHOOL.
Disclaimer: Numbers were not harmed while filming this video.
3:37 my brain already caught on fire a few minutes ago. Help
I love mathematics, but with this I was already fascinated
Sadece bir video yapman çok mu uzun sürüyor?
א
The fact that Alan can make MATH look incredible is something else
The idea of the project is very hard, but your team still do that, tks the author of this video:)😊😊😊
I'm about to yeet myself out the window
Once every few months, I find a video, that is truly entertaining and worth watching. It just stands out.  This is one of those.
I love being able to nerd out about all of this lmao
I have loved math and this is my best experience than when I knew the most beautiful equation.
Meu deus esse é o vídeo mais intelectual que eu vi esse ano
the math is wonderful
e
Brilliant
Fantástico!
Math teachers explaining this be like 🤓📚📖:
It shouldn't be animation versus calculator?. And its's not criticize.
Hermano me rompió el Cerebro la Pelea Final😮
Best thing on yt
Amazing ❤‍🔥
Did I have these kind of mathematical knowledge ?
Green=Roberto Blue=Adrian Yellow=Jesus Red=Alfredo Orange=Fred
Nunca pensé que las matemáticas fueran tan divertidas
The most “complex” drama I have ever seen.
why stickman and e started the fight at first place? haha, I don't fully understand the video but I like it
Amazing😮
me and my friend watched this and we love it . Even my ULTRA NERDY friend couldn't understand any of it past 5 mins!!!!
"Maths is simple" The maths that go in my head: *ALAN BECKER*
Amazing! How does an Animator vs Calculus sound, since this is how I feel whenever 'm struggling with Calculus lol
Man you looks like eystreem
im using this to study
e is a badass
Alan's Psychedelic Mathfast
orange vs math only in cinema
Yo Alan, new ideas 💡  M o r e A w a k e n i n g F o r T h e T e a m  Basically like TSC, the others also get awakenings  Green: Ability to control sound waves, make shocking sound that flash-bang people and able to travel at the speed of sound  Yellow: ability to hack into reality, able to control and spawn things from coding in his floating screens around him  Blue: ability to control life, have control over trees and animals, making vines that trap peoples, u get the point (im out of ideas to say here lmao)  Red: have insane strength and fighting abilities, able to control his energy to form destructive orbs (like goku lmao) or at least gib him instant transition
Œ/ŕ=b
I’M NOT EVEN HALF WAY THROUGH THE VIDEO BUT I PAUSED IT TO COMMENT BECAUSE I’M LOVING IT SO MUCH 😭❤️

This is beautiful. Also this means math is gonna help later on. Can't believe my favourite subject is gonna help what's next science?
damn they should make math a real thing
If this was how we learned math in high school, I would never have dozed off
here we goo!!
how to learn the symbols of math in 14 minutes and 2 second
Nice
TSC was a curious person now it’s a math god
It was fantastic😍😍
As an Indonesian and a 4thsemester International relation student who rarely sees math problems on campus, the scene of my teacher who taught me math at high school just flesh in front of my eyes while watching this video 😶
The mathematics you explained in this 14 min i think no one can explain i am bow down to your hardwork man
we be learning math by a stickman 😃
Mükemmel
Bro made an entire avengers movie out of pure maths
imagine he had brought an extra 1 and = through the portal and now can wreak havoc on everyones pc
This is unreal. What a video
11:16 Gurren lagann reference?
Ah yes my favorite subject math
eh aln wat you animation vs draw cartoons
This will actually be a good voss fight in a game. Imagine a game thatrevolves around math for their moves
gonna take ap calculus senior year of hs so this is pretty cool to look at beforehand!
Please create a part 2
😯
My brain stop braining...
The way he showed powers in a 3d way is just brilliant
bro just made friends with math and visited the imaginary world
Vanilla extract from this number is blocked me the way of the most popular new arrivals best sellers new arrivals best way of life is not available❤

This is what it’s like playing with your calculator in math class. Very accurate
Animetor: what did I learned math for ? Teacher: this..
Wow
Bro was mad yoo
You're genius, dude 🎉
My man went from addition to complex formulas in minutes. He's going to figure out cold fusion by this afternoon!
This taught me math better than my teacher
10 yıllık matematik hayatım ilk 7 dakikada bitti. Umarım birgün 14 dakikanın hepsini anlayabilirim
If one day you've asked yourself: "how to show mathematics concepts in a captivating way?"   this video is the answer my friends 😮
Damn Alan is so Good in maths 😍
I guess numbers have limits
Just a perfect animation. The best I´ve ever seen.

The defition of coolmath(animations)games
Help my brain can't focus on this thingy
nao entendi porra nenhuma
Berbelit  Belit otakku
Imagine being a professor and start the first math lesson with this video!
De hecho ☝️🤓
was i the only one who realized that in the beggining, when orange first found e, it was = -1, and at the final part when orange leaves and disapears, it says  e=-1
Love the animation
Wish I had this video back when I was in school
I love it so much
my brain after i watch the movie :0 (this is so cool bro i look how you just turned a number into a battle of math, this is better than the movie)
My brain hurts, i want to eat horses🤤
I wanna cry after watching this its such a masterpiece
So many details and references This is a true masterpiece and if you know what you're watching you'll really enjoy it Thank you and your math friend for making this video You're getting over yourself with each video you make
Comando estelar...
bro , now... answer me ... WHATS 2+2 ?
x² + (y - ³√x²)² = 1
WOW
i expect T.S.C to use and teach math now
10:58 the fact that he makes a ultra mega death lazer just by using math is insane
Alan Becker really made math fun!
Maybe the heads of people who can't do math
wow
Who next?biology?history?language?astronomy?or more?
brain overloading
something i found when people react to this video is that they get so focussed on the numbers and math that they never look for actual english which is extremely interesting and also a pretty good demonstration to how the human mind worked in school  you never looked for a word in your math equation, you just looked at the numbers and subconsiously made a habit out of forgetting english for the time being. either that, or you're so focussed on one thing that you never see the other. the human mind is an intriguing place and its crazy how we know more stuff outside of our planet than we do in our own skull
can you made this to some langueges so cna shown in schools
This is the most unique animation
Wow
The only math i love
Cara,o alan é tão gênio... Eu realmente nunca esperei algo assim dele,ele é literalmente o melhor animador.
I hate math Why am I so bad at art all I dra are stick figures   This man:
The Second Coming will be absolutely overpowered if he can keep this power
It looks very scary to switch from normal integers to  -square root. Very educative content Alan keep this up!
❤❤ VERY GOOD❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great Animation, Great Entertainment, and most importantly, the best way to get curious about all the stuff appearing!  Thanks a lot for another cool animation, I can't stop rewatching this 😁
Imagine this as a videogame
It's one of asmr
The math in this video is the same math as in real life, but it's not annoying. Why don't I get bored?
Maths was never that much interesting 🔥🔥
Math is not my thing. I do not know what I've just to see but it's absolutely wonderful. You're genius
This is not only an animation to kill time. This is a masterpiece of art and science. Yes! This animation contains SCIENCE. Grow up and watch to understand the realness of the MATH! Thank you Alan Becker!
I finally understnad he power of MATH
Is there gonna be a part two

At what point did it stop making sense for you guys?😂...For me it was 7:35
Que brisa esse vídeo
we didn't even talk about grassmann number with its soul part yet, finite "body" but infinite "total soul"
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!
ANIMATION VS. SCIENCE will be totally epic🔥
i really wanna see now animation vs physics this is so good
Wow Alan, U and yr team are very awsome❤
Godam that is beautifull
pov: 2 𝑛 = inf :O
It's fantastic 🎉🎉 Where can i find this sounds effects pls?
came back to be amazed again !! and its Pure BLISS !!!

Hope someday I can  understand what happends after 7:10
Бля, это охуенно!!!! Можно еще, пожалуйста!

I love you man
This need to be a movie bro THIS IS MOST FAMOUS  People who agree 👇
So is no one gonna talk about how orange almost shattered that place because of that powerful move near the end?

This is amazing
5:20, how iota axis was possible

Please you have to make another part, this is so perfect to be just one part
It's really mind-blowing........

Alan needs oscars. This thing can be used to teach any level of math from simple addition to the far end of calculus.
it's mathin' time
how cool is that
I need more video like this
This is so genious. Respect👍

🤓😇🟠🟡🟢🔵🔴❤️🎥
Alan Becker, could you please add a new character for me? Let her name be brown and be unbelievably strong and always be next to the oranges
My vote for World Domination now goes to Alan Becker🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💥💥💥💥💥
❤❤❤
Software used?
This is a master piece , I wish this was my first introduction to Maths.
Ik this increases the love for math mor
math
e is so cute
This is the most accurate sci fi....
For all those wondering the e represents Eulers number, with the whole thing representing Eulers identity which showed that e to the power of i (the unit representing imaginary numbers) multiplied by pi. At the end, the other four characters shown were Zeta (ζ), Phi (φ), Delta (𝛿), and Aleph (the massive figure shown at the end, representing the cardinality (size) of infinite sets)
Okey, ahora cómo The Second Coming entro a ese programa?
This really shows that math is our all's biggest enemy
I dont understand.. 🥲
I’m sure Gauss would have loved to watch this masterpiece.

This is a marvelous art, I saw the other but this video change the entire world, I love the matrix in 3D details while powering, thanks for this. I declare a fan of math.
에유 나가뒤질 한국인들 여기 왜있냐
This is a certified banger of a video.  It presents maths to all ages in the most cool, accessible and simplistic ways possible, showing hard and abstract concepts in understandable ways that can only be done in animation.   It rewards those that have spent their lives on the subject. The pride in knowing every equation, every proof and every little Easter egg, is validation and recognition for their efforts in learning and expanding on the vast sea of knowledge that is  mathematics.  It helps people that are in the middle of learning math. It motivates the demotivated by displaying how cool maths can be, and guides those that are struggling by presenting concepts in fun and simple ways.  Most importantly however, it inspires and draws people to math. Those that never tried math will be inspired and those that dislike math may give it a second chance after seeing how cool maths can be.  This is one of the best, if not the best, math videos of time.
you and your team are absolute madmen, this is amazing
This video made me got brain damage. Alan is a genius math, he is also perfect for math teacher
can't wait for animation vs algebra
I couldn't of solve this
This was so awesome , that I can't even think of words brilliant enough to describe how beautifully and smartly all of this was done. Hats off to you man 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
The sound design was next level.
This is a complete movie on its own.
Gamers would be genuis if math was like this.
This is a wholesome video !
HOT DAMN!!! Best video i've seen this year on Youtube. AMAZING!!
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
As a person who loves math, this is a wonderful video. Great  job! 👏👍

Thank because this i can finally finished my math exam
I somehow learnt more maths in this 1 video then all my math classes :/
math is now my favorite subject 🤓
You know what would be cool. Forgetting everything about maths. Starting from scratch and learning it all again, but every year I come back to this video to see how far I can go until I can’t understand the concepts. Once I reach the end it will most likely symbolise the point where I graduate from the education system and must make my own proofs and equations. Would be an extremely useful tool to show fun maths can be as you learn it and make the experience that much more enjoyable and rewarding for more people.
POV:alan makes fan service  ☝️🤓🤑🤑🤑🤨📄🖊️
i genuinely want to see more of this
Meren banget👏👏👏👏
New number lore
Someone has done it. all reference and meaning to all math show in this video .😮
Me impresiona tu edicion

Can you teach maths ? 🥺
0:36 i like,how he shows that zero is nothing in math
its fucking lit
Why is there a huge letter in Hebrew at the end?
Never seen animation like this it's amazing 😮❤❤
There are so many references, easter eggs, and amazing effects. Thank you Alan because this is so good!
These are the simplest math equations lol
The poetry and level of knowledge and not to mention the imagination&creativity  to this legendary presentation saddens me. How will I enjoy anything in life after watching this??
this is such a pointless video
this is what the class nerd plays in his mind
And it all started whith 1 + 1
Alan really showed us how hard and  fun math can be
I love it!.
Cringe cringe very cring bad bad cringe i dislike bc bad cringe so cring and bad and badbabdbabd
this was my favorite
Now thats why i love math!
Wooow! The Sound effects!
i actually dont know all about this and make a new video plz

Cool math story 👍
Was that aleph null at the end??
I feel like this could be made into a video game, or a least the story could
Can't wait to see this being used to teach math in schools worldwide.
This is awesome
How long it took for this awesome animation.
Animation is good to learn math

I will show this to my Maths teacher, after that I'll edit this to tell you guys his reaction!
@Alan Becker one on computer languages please 🙌
That's literally Awesome!!!  One question, did these functions and the relations of the 'e' ar really true of they are fictional?
Jesus this is a masterpiece, I love that animation that is soooooooo good I can’t tell with words but can’t with tell with maths either 😂. Thank you so much really great work.
Alan becker was so lucky YouTube watched this video
amazing

This was eye candy
One of the coolest video I’ve ever seen🔥
This is the sickest animation I've seen in a while
This taught me more math than school, and I didn't even know wtf was goin' on in the video.
Any mathers would like to explain?
Conclusion: Nintendo, meted a la letra e al smash
This all started with number 1
You lost me at 1+1
You showing us how beautiful math is
Go please animation vs Phisics
Bro is making this animation becuase. He is trying to show his teacher he didnt miss the math class🤣. Massive creation
IS GOOD
Wow
@jeromepolin
This is so amazing😮🤯 Mathamazing❤💯
Bro Albert Einstein would love this :D
만화가 지리네
Math Magician..
Though I had plans to watch John Wick tonight, I just couldn't take my eyes off this masterpiece, which has both more action and depth to it. Amazing work !
Rip The Second Coming😢
It felt like infinity was talking to us directly
ohio math be like:
I wonder you could go beyond this
First time I cried due to maths, and it was because of its beauty...
The best animation i have seen till now. Hats off to you and your team... 🎉🎉🎉
Masterpiece!
Regret rejecting this man huh Pixar??
Hey Alan can you explain the 4D dimension
im onna show this to my children to make them love maths
I still hate math 🙂
Too Complex For Me
good video
Me when I finally realize that I have to use math to defeat math
This is fabulous!
estou maravilhada com a animação, e ao mesmo tempo assustada..
I am only familiar with the symbols and don't remember the meaning as I learnt it long way back in school, now I am a lawyer and been so long since I have done Maths. This video makes me to want to revisit math.
I just finished watching from Bilibili...
greatest mathematical battle in history
the fact that all of this actually makes sense is beautiful
Me vs my math teacher:
I love it  It is so good
Not only Alan make the best animation, he is also a smart man
Saya kesini karena zulfi
This is top tier
This is by far the best
never liked watching math so much
Math lore vs Math gameplay
sigma moment in 7:35
🔥 🔥
Engineers students related it😢
this might be the firs time ever saying this Math is cool
BRUHH THIS WAS AEWSOMEEEE
This is brilliant mate
This takes all the interesting parts of math and makes it a wicked battle. It makes me want to understand the equations I didn't.
Something was something was wrong with sc head when he was looking at thita
No please animation vs Minecraft
this was so cool
This Is the coolest thing i have ever seen
Matematika itu menyenangkan bukan? Bukan! 🤓
😮😮😮😮😮😮
Amazing and smooth animation really love it
what is the ein ?
My fav scene is when orange rolls up In a circle straight to e
wow it very very very good and exciting
It was just awesome!!!ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ
YOU GOOD 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊 BRO
Math is one of may favourite subjects and this video is soo good
Now this is a beautiful video. Using a subject most don't like and creating a beautiful, encapsulating animation exploring different mathematical methods. Amazing work, really went all out with this!
This is where 3b1b learned how to do math
كيف يحل كل هاذا ولله لو أنا كنت مكانو والله كنت ما أحل كل هاذا أصراحه ما شاء الله هو حقين الجامعه ما شاء الله أبغاك تعلمني يا أستاذ 🧑‍🏫🧑‍🏫🧑‍🏫❤❤❤
Broooooo😂😂❤❤loved it
I love maths
bro just made a video of our all 12 years of math class
That's why i don't like minus digits... They r EVIL!!
Respect 😊
2:05 turbulence on that is crazy
Now I learnt the whole maths, if maths was a movie..you know what I mean 💯🔥
best thing on thy internet
Man this can potentially become an amazing series, like this first video is on analysis and complex analysis, imagine number theory or abstract algebra or even higher concepts 🔥
X ———— 5|2005   D- divide M - Multiply  S - Subtract  B - Bringdown  🔁
I never knew math was so powerful

Animator Vs Animation new video please❤
i love Math🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow youtube replied 😮
This animation is EPIC! Alan Becker. If your reading this I love your vids they are really good and I hope you make part 2 of this where he escapes jail using math
Victim is orange's son.
I wonder what would happen if they divided 0 by 0.....
😵😮😮😮😮😵😵😲😲😲
I learned more math to Alan than any of my Math teacher
This is my 10th time watching this
I love this
one of most hardest stickman animation to understand, thought they were supposed to be designed intuitive but uh...
los sueños de mi profe de trigonometria
music pleaz
Beautiful 💜💜
If I wasn’t stupid I would love this!
Me in hell afther killing the one who created math 💀
the only video where you dont scroll through the comments
My brain after watch this video:💀
-e = e-
Goated
King Orange vs the dark lork please
Coolest mathematics video ever made...
10:34 man built a death star
The deadliest and most complex math equation the  circumference star   Edit:but if partnered with science will become complex and can create a much deadlier weapon
Cool
Contra Math Force
Well done!
This was and will always be the worlds most powerful equation.
What happened if when stickman used the strongest shotgun if was = f (∞)?
"it all started with a question..." BUT THIS GUY FINISH MATH IN 18 MINUTE
As someone who sucks at math I was lost from about 2min to 5min mark as to what was happening
ang  galing mo mag gawa ng animation vs math❤
since the 8 minutes i was lost, but what can i say im just a 10 grader
Part 2
I think may be this is how S.Ramanujan saw numbers and equation revealing solutions to him.  Kudos to animators. Brilliant work
Me saying it’s real and not just random maths while figuring out 3/4 of the entire video
What happened at the last
10:05 this is a dark souls boss
Alguien llame a Mathes Mike, al Traductor de Ingeniería y al Calvo de Juan 😩
das very good
The fact animation not know of math😅
the cool math teacher be like
That function shotgun was so accurate  The bullets were graph of tan.🙌
The fact
Dang bro this is even better than my school
Guess who's math teacher in gonna get filled with questions
My head is so confused 😕
Alan Baker after having studied all branches of mathematics: 🗿Well, I'll go make a video about mathematics
Im gaining interest in maths
Yeh. Now maþ is my favourite subject. I also like þe eulers number cause its funny, i þink þo. I also dont þink þat you can put şixty four ones on a maþ solußion bro. Þat so stupid😂. Can you make animation vs engliß, geo, histor or even some sort of subjects?
I coulnt wait until the end. I am mechadronic engineer studied advance calculus. But this single video let me realise more prencipe of math than my math proffessors. Thats amazing
2 😝
Top 5 villains in history 1. e^iπ 2. Thanos
What
Super Epik
nooooo, stickman😭😭😭
I hope that we can see the “ei” boy inside Alan’s pc some day
i know al of it. in fact,i can do all the math in this video combined without thinking about it.
Please give me a sequel
Incredibly presented the basis algebra 🫡
the tan waves for the after effects from the gun amazing touch 8:40
😮😮😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 FANTASTIC!!!!
that is beautiful, great job man
what is going to be next animation ve alphabet?
8th graders nightmare 😅
Did I actually LEAARRRRNNN?????
Did i just learn something
Maths is my favorite subject ❤️❤️
13:46 - ALEPH 0???
와 이게 뭐야 개소름돋네
if u use headphones and put it to the max sound it sounds like a movie ngl
every time i look away bro comes up with a new equation. 💀
Math scares me
the+end =eht+edn ex(th+nd) ex(ht+dn)
Who thought that math was cool
My favorite stick figures are orange  orange king tco and blue
Hi Hi Hi
speechless....👌👌👌👌👌
He had me confused on 1+1 bro
This is a masterpiece!
Si… esto solo me confirma que el equipo de animadores y alan becker estan LOOOOOCOSSSS, como el webi wabo
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Cool animation
Why is it so intense
Dang after watching the reference video, this video itself is more than a masterpiece, truely insane I just don't even know what to say about this anymore, great job ig
Best Video Ever
Mathematics has never been so epic!
next video Animation vs Physics
Ricardo Waterson Lore
I learned more math than I did in High School.
I wish I could understand this
Stick figures are the superior beings i didnt even know 60% of the equations he did and im in highschool
hi
Im still disappointed that when they said "math is fun" they didnt meant by this :(
I understood almost everything up until 6:44 the second orange pulled the pi apart, I immediately understood almost 0% of the math after that.
ok. Can this be submitted for best animated short? Its incredible
He taught entire algebraic in  a video
叹为观止！❤
Pov:tsc wearing vry All:👁👄👁
When I have a test i watch this to review 🙂🙂🙂🙂
I did not understand anything that just happened except the story but Math star was cool asf
aay que bonito el final
a
Bro he just make a gun with a math
FInally, uni math was worth learning!
Wh....Wait.....Did e just....absorb orange guy, or distribute him across infinite n dimensional space? DID e TRICK ORANGE GUY TO WIN?!?!?!😧😱😭
I hate maths.... But I love this. Am I going mad?
Pov: dis how Math looks to me 💀
Reflek ngalahin jerome polin gweh bjir 🤓
The moral of this epic story: To the vector belong the spoils. 😏
Can anyone explain what happened after 11:26?? I know it's related to dimensions. At least tell me what specific topic it is.
dude legit made a boss fight out of math
Bro it's freaking amazing!
That fighting scene b/w e^iπ and f(∞) is my new favourite ..  some "real" and "unimaginable"  actions ..
Unbelievable..... Everything that exist and does not exist in the universe in a youtube video. 🔥
t amo
Yo aprendien matemáticas
wow I am so dump XDD😅
Wow!  That's shows how beautiful is Mathematics ❤
This video is amazing! But after i search alan becker and see that he is born in ohio made me suprised
Broo the sfx >>>>
Alan becker and his crew made the impossible, they made math, intresting
Hello please next the animation vs.  Roblox
how do i submit subtitles?
TBH this is so cool
I have rarely see an video that blows my mind like this one
Though my favorite sub is math and science i dont have much idea about sin, cos and other math symbols, equations and stuff but i like it, its interesting
OMGG 😂❤
Alaph nol(I’m not sure how to spell it):follow me folkes meet my friend. His name is omega
Interesting! Do more of these with other stickmans please
THE MOST amazing mathematical stuff i've seen in youtube so far. AMAZING.
imagine the orannge guy broke the complex plane and ended up distorting the reality pretty horrifying if its true. kudos to the creator its was so fun to watch
Math Sometimes Hurts… literally 😂
since when math is awesome!? This is too cool!!
Bro just bacame the new Einstein
Yeah  The great of Aleph Zero
How math feels to learn
THE PRINCE WARRIORS
Math is beautiful when taught correctly.
@13:33 - THE GREEKS HAVE ARRIVED
This video despite being entertaining, is also very educative in which I decided shared this to my math teacher and she absolutely loved it, also wanting to share it to her colleagues.  You basically have made history and influence the majority of lives to help them get through school math with good explanations, thank you Alan Becker!
This explain from how complicated math is
Math is really dangerous 😅
10:00 Ohh Nah, When I said Math is kicking my a** I didn't mean it literally like this.
as a college math major it makes me truly happy that you could explain the beauty of math in one video
How do get headache - watch some thing about MATH... still, it was aweasome.
Li like how dah stikman go:VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM.
I saw this video on reel and straight came here
Bro studied for this 💀
nice
This video was so creative. Good concepts and man, you're so talented. Nice ideas
Alan Becker could we collab?
∞
is this how he got powers?
bro woke up and dropped a fire animation video
I understood things I never understood in math class with this.
Big respect. known you  for 15 year when Win XP still popular 🪂🪂
Now this art, nay a masterpiece.
🥶🥶🤯😱🤙💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
faz a parte 2 por favor
The maths its so funny
"The math test isn't that hard" The math test:
What about red and green and blue,and yellow?
The greatest cinematic masterpiece
Animation vs god
How do I learn this skill
When math and art comes together! Well math=art! 😮
My brain now hurt
basically nerds:
This video  went viral at Bilibili(A Chinses Video Platform), has watched over 4.3 million times, and also is the hotest video in Bilibili🥰
-eitherΠ
youtube: math is now my favorite subject 🤓 me: umm what is e tp?
Alan becker videos are super good
My guy really fighting math😂😂
I love the fact at the end he goes and the rest of the symbols of math he didn't learn appeared showing if he stayed they might come out from smallest to biggest like the first one we see was I think the lowest of them so it showed up first also I want more like orange appearing with his friends and he starts teaching them I'd like to see orange at a minecraft blocky wooden desk with a make shift chalk board and the first math symbol/ THE E opens the door and helps teach about him and then the next and over and over till they go outside to see the biggest symbol/THE N
1+1=2
I can believe this was published 4 days ago💀
Alan i have a question 0÷0=?
Hi Alan Becker I have been watching you for 3 Years. Please Pin me.
if we could do math this way in real life  i would have good grades in math
Me got a 44/100 in maths test: BRO THATS WRONG 1+1=11
Speechless
Alan really went from being a stop motion worm to a litteral God at animating stick figures
Bang @jeromepolin jelasin ini bang
I want to tell you why this is so complicated
I saw that e thingy. Then.      E.
And this is truly my nightmare
I don't like school
This the stuff i dream of before calculus finals
When knowing math actually pays off
Now im thinking, why i understand 50% what hapenned??? im nerd😢
bro just explained the entire math lore within one animation
Awesome animation!
this is why math is useful
Alan what happend with the Minecraft building contest
knew all the way up to 8 min (besides e^(i*pi), all I know is thats its eulers identity) rising seventh grader moment
喜欢这种知识划过脑子不留下痕迹的感觉
I think this is the TSC mind of MATH, because everything is black and at the end TSC going back to the real word with the help of e. The next videos must be TSC having MATH skill to escape the prison.
Bro I learned more from this video than what any teachers teached me
Beautful
No puede ser. Ando en 2do grado de secundaria y me decís que voy a estudiar eso?me pegó un tiro
Masterpiece 👏
bro is teaching better then school how
Wow my brain is blowing up
no puedo creer lo que acabo de ver
Where ep 2????????!?!?!!?!?=((
That math star was 10/10, or, i guess it was more a..... Graph star? One of the 2
Wow, thats art
Cool
Yo jugando con la calculadora :
Bro orange literally outsmarted every Asian kid in world 💀
SC knows more math than my math teacher :O
OMG i just relisized that ive been watching you for 6 years  but i wasnt subscribed plz forgive me😭
1+1=2
Unbelievable!!!! What an amazing thing I've seen !? Thanks for this clever amazing beautiful short movie I watched today !
Wow, just wow. This is why I love math, I watched a video on the references and saw a few new functions and equations.   I like how it all started from addition then to multiplication and then complex equations.
Just Beautiful, Amazing! Wonderful idea! Congrats!
comp sci majors:
Bro gave me chills multiple times
Youtube muhammaddarol10508 Hey
FUCKING CRAZY
Math lore
gash lol
i just learned that pi is from sin and cos
Well i'm going to be a math nerd and add +1 subscriber to your total subscribers!
Mathematics never looked that awesome and fun ever before
IDEA: ANIMATION VS  BALIS BACICS
TSC is learning math faster than i can
i must say i dont know a ton about math but after seeing some of the math explainer videos covering this video i must say the dedication and the amazingness of making it all real math and making sure to respect how they actually work is amazing i must also as usual compliment both the animation smoothness and espically the sound design in this video it was top notch thank you for such an amazing work this is definatly a masterpiece in my eyes
Emang boleh matematika sangat menyenangkan seperti itu?
Imagine how much work this took 👏👏
W o a h That was epic
THIS IS MASTERPIECE
❤❤
Alan Becker! 🔥
The most epic way to display -1
Geogebra with RTX on
The soumd effects are so divine
The entire time I am watching this all I can think of is WARFRAME… lmao
this is one of the videos i feel should get 100m views
SEEING COS AND SIN VISUALIZED FROM THE CIRCLE— This literally brings tears to my engineering eyes :’D
That has to be get more views than any other vid come on!
Try making other School subjects, like Science and History
Yep m gonna focus on math now
Stunning, very creative!
🟠
Next Video: Animation VS Music
I am in awe of your work Alan, Congratulations man!
i need a math anime
😮😮😮 cool
If math was like this i would be smarter
❤❤❤
Esto esta a otro nivel ❤
The aleph null at the end
Excellent, love it.
SO IT IS ALL ADDITION????
TSC find the myth number:1:39
the beauty of the math :)
POV: Math in the future.  The teacher: TSC. Students:Better than old math.
This guy can make weapons and enemy with anything
1+1=11 🤓☝
Nice
You should have released this on Tau Day 😂
I dont know math but this is insane its so fcking cool
Now we need animator vs English
brain hurty
He came back if I can remember right-
2
Also what does f(dot) mean? He's shooting out points from the function? There's something with the tangent function as well?
your animations impress me even more each time
I don't quite get what's going on @8:30. It seems like sin(pi) and cos(pi) are each being substituted for 1, or at least that sin(pi) / cos(pi) = 1. But neither of those things are true. Sin(pi) is 0. I see that he's somehow splitting the letter pi into it's two legs...but I don't get exactly what it means.
Wtf bro you smokin?
6÷2(1+2)=???
Hey alan becker i got merch it's really cool
Brilliant.
Didnt know math could be one of the most deadly weapons ive ever seen on this channel
your videos are really good
Wow!
I want yellow to be their teacher yellow is literly so smart
The reason why alan becker doesnt use his computer with TSC because i think he has new computer i think alan himself will appear in next episode?
NUCLEAR EXPLOSION 11:07
This is so good!
The best. The best🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Simplemente maravilloso.
Man how can i learn to animate like this ??
Bro... this is amazing, I mean, perfect. It's been a long time since I've watched something so incredible, this might be my favorite video on this platform, im here before 10M literally 9.9M. I just hope that in the future I'll be someone who can animate like you, I love your work and I've been watching you for a long time, please continue doing what you do, and never let others downgrade you, thank you for the really hard work just to entertain me, no words. ❤
And ω?
i want to see e more in different animation
π
Hey Alan Becker what are the genders for the stick figures ?  Please look What are their genders
Aleph null, titan of the math realm, nice
Man turned math into a weapon what next vidamon D?
O my god
I learned more math here than I have in my entirety of school education
That music...
one of the best videos was invested the whole time.
Yes this is what I do when my calculator started spitting letters
Que vrg xdxdxdxdddd
joder esto es cine 🚬
A la verga estuvo ÉPICO
If you showed this to a child, They would 100% be more excited for math class. xD
e
I bet this video will have 50 million views in under 5 months. (It got 10 million in 5 days, really impressive isn't it?)

It's really good
Math Is now 1000000X MY FAV SUBT
I don't even understand most of this but it is awesome!
Is this part of season 4
I derived immense enjoyment from witnessing the mesmerizing animation depicting the enthralling encounter between mathematical concepts engaged in fierce combat. The seamless integration of mathematical principles with the dynamic visual medium creates a captivating spectacle, where the abstract realm of numbers and equations is brought to life in a visually stimulating manner. This unique fusion of art and mathematics allows for a fresh and engaging perspective on these traditionally abstract concepts. Through the medium of animation, the intricacies of mathematical operations and the elegance of mathematical relationships are personified, transforming them into formidable adversaries engaged in an epic clash. Such an imaginative portrayal instills a sense of excitement and wonder, highlighting the inherent beauty and dynamism that lie within the realm of mathematics.
BRUTAL!!!!
Bro this is the math lore 💀
If math was like this it would definently be my favorite subject
this stick figure learned basic arithmetic operations in the same 14 minutes it learned calculus
I learned more math in this video than in school :/
0-0 = 0

I knew orange can do math better
LOVE IT! Love math, love animation!
that doesn't change the fact that math is hell hard
This ain’t math it’s war
i hate math but i love this video
this is LITERALLY how i envision the mathematics dimension!!
Now can you make Animation vs Linguistics?
omg
I need 3b1b, Standup Maths, Veritasium, Numberphile, Mathologer, Khan Academy, Organic Chemistry Tutor, Flammable Maths, BPRP, Up and Atom, Andrew Dotson, Zach Star, Kurzgesagt, and the Green brothers to react to this.
Ricardo jogando calculadoras no modo dificil:
Orange stikman is really helping me with math thank you❤❤
You can already tell this is going to be the video that cool math teachers show during the beginning of the semester
If Einstein was living today he'd made sth as simple but sophisticated as this
I love how im so much of a math nerd that i got all the references
Alguien que hable español??? xD
Wow
Math the hardest battle of all
6:17 SUS moment 😳
How to teach kids math the right wat
Im not which was harder to do the math or the animation
Wtf did i watch my head hurts 🤕😂
Bro this is literally the best math content i have ever seen.  Huge respect it's amazing 👏
Cool video! To bad I understand NONE of it!
i never think that math can be sou beautiful.
The beauty of this video gave me the  motivation to finish the math homework I’ve been procrastinating
Respect almost 10m views just in 4 days ]
Terkoiz wtf bro😂
I can't believe math (which I hate) kept me entertained for more than 13 min
* Mathematics prepares you for life * Thief enters my house my reaction: 8:30
Chiste Matemático
After veiwing this video,i finally can say math actually not that boring
Bro made math cool💀
8:24 I Don't really understand what happems here but I love this part
Would be cool if the video started with an empty set and by the half reached algebraic topology, motives and deformation theory
alot ]
1+1=2
i love this video 😍😍😍😍😍
What teachers think what we’re gonna use the math for:
Mutivariable calculus cool
11:18 at that moment I already supposed Lie groups and algebras would appear somehow 😁
Ew math
that stickman knows more than me
ここまで素晴らしい動画は見たことがない
Professora de matemática:Alan vc e meu aluno preferido m Fez muitas contas para fazer esse vídeos eu te mao🤗
Can you help me with my math homework please
Which you would make a game about animator vs animation, kinda like this where it ruins your pc and you try to stop it, the opposite of there is no game, a bit if you were the program instead of the player but to the style of animation you make.
I hope i can understand this video some day
Marvellous video! <3 <3 <3
do animation vs power rangers
Math!
MAKE VOSIS
Pleace alan backer color black pleace

OMG...THIS IS MIND BLOWING KUDDOS TO THE ORANGE CHARACTER YOU ARE SMART THAN ME DUDE HAHAHA
This blows my mind
Pls add a music version of this
I loved this video so much i had to watch it twice. Got a little emotional when I saw ℵ show up.
INCREIBLE VIDEO -.-
Excellent video I wonder if it could expanded onto other subjects
I learned more here than school💀
Excellent
Ah yes, my greatest fear.
Math is nutshell:
yo en el examen poniendo la primer cosa que se me viene a la cabeza porque ya se me olvido dividir, multiplicar, restar y sumar:
=3
прадолжи саму историю
as someone who loves math, this is by far the coolest thing i have ever seen
Hoy aprendí más de lo que un todo un ciclo escolar
Use me  as a like button for the mathematician !
All ÷ 0
Alan eres el dios de la animación ❤
can you do Animation vs. Meth?
this man just single handedly made math fun
Would be fun to see this as a game, i would like to shoot with numbers and equations
😊Ююжж
SO! AWESOME!
This has to be my favorite vid on your channel it was amazing{!}
Every mathematician be like
NOOOO 2+2=5
tbh this teaches more than actual teachers
This genuinely gave me so much more appreciation for math
You lost me at "1+ 1"
this quite literally went from 0 to a 100 a bit quickly
And my calculus teacher used to say you will become a calculus teacher if you plan to study calculus, this bro got 9 millions views in 4 days making $45000 with a math nerd.

Euclid would be proud, I think.
Is it a letter family or what?... 😂 Btw, א means g-d
This is a motherfucking piece of art, really. The fact that every operation has mathematical sense scares me. I immagine the hour behind this project. Props 🤙🏼🤙🏼❤
Me when math test
this video smart, hurt my tiny brain, ouch
I can just imagine a teacher showing this to their class to show basic multiplication
This gave me an unexpectedly high amount of joy
How much iq you have?
My brain hurts now 😌
Mathematically it's all true. These animators are unbelievable (＠_＠)
I am blown away! The animation looks so simple in a way (like lines and circles) but it's soo good! It sent shivers down my spine, especially with those crisp sound effects, I just couldn't!
The fact that I know all these operations but at the same time haven't completely know how to use them, makes me see how big the math world is
Animation vs able (scp)
UwU/10
This needs to be nominated for an Oscar
Was that negative?
how did all these are real? I want them on my pc too Alan!
Deserves oscar

Я поражаюсь от того сколько у тебя вдохновения, что ты смог создать из математики сражение с  участием числа пи)! Ты один из самых крутых аниматоров... Мне кажется что jz boy мог бы с тобой сделать что то, вы такие классные
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑❤‍🩹 vs  💔
Huge respect for the creator. One with physics 🙌
Only Alan Becker could make math fun.
Nǐ shì zěnme zuò dào de?
Thanks from Computer Science graduates 😊
THAT WAS SO GOOD! Maths is my favorite subject and it was the best animation ever)
fantastic short movie of the mathematic
Of course Alan knows how to make math good
bro turned "🤓" into a 14 minute video
Ngl this is better than boruto
Please make this into a game! ❤
As a math student... I am in love with this animation!
But better
Bro remade the death star
2:51 SC is the only one who can divide by zero (this is also what is happening you are dividing by 0 so you are dividing by nothing causing an infinite loop)
Gooooooooooooooood + cool
cool way 2 make something hated cool
Dude you’re making math teachers around the globe happy
I Cracked the Code Boiz
When Alan live in Asia
This is ballistically creative I tell you
Toooooo much math
This is just my brain during math
I can confirm as a former high school mathlete, these fight scenes are an accurate representation of our thought processes when we get too curious
Just a regular math lessons in Ohio
Or like fights where two characters that never see each other fight to see who would win
WHY IS THIS MAKING ME WANT TO LEARN MATH
Images that short where king orange and the dark lord fight but without red ruining it
I can't stop rewatching this. You made this too good!
Alan Beckermet taught me all the math in a few mins than my teachers did for like 8 years
I teared up at the end :'c
9:10 Imagine being the lone positive hero getting owned by an army of negative ones.
this is so sick espacially when you know all of the math
As a mathematician I can say the equation is right
This is the most technically advanced Animation I've ever seen, I'm so gobsmacked and lost for words on how amazing this was. Kudos to you all
IS SO SAD
this guys videos never ceases to amaze me
my man ... how did you do this
You did it beautifully, I hope you will do more episodes with Serra Minecraft :)
this animation is literally me trying to finish my math homework
Im scared of math now
We need a sequel!
This video is raising bar
It’s wonderful (это превосходно(вроде))
…Okay fine I’ll make math my new hobby.
haaaaa my head many math things
my mind crashed
Godlike entertaiment.
Alternative title: Math to Alphabets in under 20 minutes
Seeing Aleph Null at the end gave me goosebumps.
how did you make math entertaining? you are a god of animation
I understood everything, OMG, im proud of myself 😢. Such a very impressive job Alan, keep going 💪
Best way to teach kids how maths is done
If you did animation vs math can you do animation vs language subject
this is too much math for an american to handle D:
hi alan :)
This animation is another reason why I’m gonna pursue Math! Thank you for making this!!
the fact that i understood most of what was happening prabobly means i should go outside more
bro i got PTSD from watching this
How about music next?
How about music next?
yet he still can't sing..
OH MY GOD IT'S PERFECT
Hola hello
I always liked math
Plot twist: it was Second coming prison from "wanted" AvA animation that's why he was alone
And thus, Geometry Dash was born.
A NEW VIDEO!!
My qi befora that:1000000
please pause at 4:06 is to funnny xD !
If the calculator or at least the teaching of mathematics in school were like this and with such music, then the popularity of schools would rise to the skies of the Stratosphere!
I understood every equation cause maths is my favourite, i remember bunking My own class to attend maths class on other section of same standard and solving equations the moment mam used to give us To solve i personally like Calculus it was intriguing.
Bro literally made death star in math world💀💀💀💀💀
TEAMO
9:42 so by killing the e things with the gun your basically simplifying it?
That was legit mad awesome 😎😎
É incrível, divertido, prazeroso, delicioso, explicativo, interesante, ipnotizante... Realmente merece um OSCAR. Roteiro, Som, Design... Não consigo achar palavras para expressar o quanto eu AMEI esse video. UAU!
esta muy buenooo y épico, pero me agobiao jaajaja ayay lo bueno es que solo llevo hasta mate 2 xd
Probably just me but this gives major Tron: Legacy vibe
sequel, NOW
Damner, j'aime les mathématiques
This is incredible, and kind of makes me want to do something like this as a VR experience. A world of pure math where you can manipulate equations and geometry all around you. I think it would make for a very nice educational experience
Wow, I actually quite admit. But I actually like this its reminds me of all the math i went through in middle school.
This was the best animation I’ve ever seen…
please, make animation vs animator 6!
This what is called multidiscipline talent and true dedication.
>sees Aleph >looks at powerscaling community DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DONE!?
Bruh, how tf do I know most of this at 15? Is basic calculus in junior high school too much?
I like the guest appearance of aleph null at the end
No way that math its good no way how?! 141627%10=i
as someone who likes math, i swear ive NEVER seen trigonometri and all this other kind of stuff be shown and used in a more awesome way! could def. be used to make others more interested as well
The average 10th grader learning about complex numbers.
amazing
the urge to show this to my math teacher
Cool math games be like in 2300
Actually…ok vid I guess..
I learned more math here than inna year at a private school
this is funny, cuz i made a simular video 2 months ago. 😂
I understand all Now .......
2 part please
This was amazing
I would love to see more of videos like this
This video thought me more math than my school did
Imagine how cool would it be if Rick and Morty was also fighting this insane -1
I love this video so much. Math is my favorite subject.
Never thought i'd ever watch a 14min long video about maths and not get bored
Idk what is this or why this or what but it a masterpiece and i love it     Alan can make everything even math into a stickman vid   Also teach me more than School
Told you, internet explorer is bad
from alan to Alan , Great job! 👏
When you smoke too much math:
*I need TSC to be my math teacher.*
Just for those who don't know, N in math = infinity, and they are chasing it, therefore the ending.
as a math nerd this was extremely satisfying to watch
nice lmmao
To be continue
Madly respect for you man, how much effort and time you put into this video. Logic af bro. The best animation ever. I love it ❤
Everyone: Math Sucks! Alan: Are you sure about that?
This video is a continuation of animation vs animator :)
imagine that final weapon of mass destruction but instead of the dot its  infinity again

I used to understand math!
most gripping vd that i have ever seen
I reach heaven
Idea:what about you yes you make a game about this video;)!
What a fantastic execution of an idea, feel like my old maths teacher would've shown us this every year in class. ➗✖️➕➖ Well done 👌!
Epic
Make another part probably animation vs math 2
Alan Becker and his animations totally DESERVE all the recognition and views they can get!   Really hope you still keep being awesome and creative Alan! 👏👏👏
Dylan dog: Math a school i do tecnogoly are awards i do lore math is good but better time i now a doing math be gone i got must a instrend i know math do school do math magic like dunno i can't be do homework a like a cartoon newgrounds
I heard if you jump on the floor The floor will become the roof and the roof will become the jump
why is euler’s number so difficult? i thought the whole point of it was that it was nice to work with..
This is what people call a content.
Software name please?
Alan makes math epic and cool he’s so talented oh my god
your telling me I Went To School For Years And Then This Was Uploaded ;-;
Learn maths good orange stick man
The orbital cannons with sin and cos waves combined and hitting them to f(.) Is just blowing my mind out of the universe...
OMG YOUTUBE I LOVE YOUR APP
Please
Creates the brown stickman
Create a new stickman
Now i will learn about math
Pls do more of this
Imagine that there is no limit and thanks to the math we found new world and manipulate physical material transform in where ever like 👏👏👏
ALAN'S TEAM MADE MATHEMATICS BEAUTIFUL  EXCUSE ME WHILE I SCREAM AND CRY
Creo que esto sucede en el transcurso de cuando pausan TSC en animation vs animator VI y por eso es que llega despausado en la carcel, si no entienden vallan a ver A vs A VI en su canal
Was sick with HELLS ITCH sunburn. Feeling intense pain and itching couldn’t sleep. Watching this fast-paced animation really helped me take my mind off it until I was able to fall asleep.  The sun is evil people!  Thank you so much for your animations they’re great
8:16 this is absolutely sick
Me in calculator be like
Woah😮
You know you messed up when you broke math.
The only person who turned maths into an animation
And then all the other thinga that use calculating
Amazing

math is now my favorite subject 🤓
Mathsterpiece
If you could make a 1-hour version, that would be amazing.
respect++
is 🤩🤩
This is PEAK!!! Just pure art!
I just like seeing the numbers
When ur math teacher is also a creative writing teacher
Quick question: How many frames per second do you use to make your animations
I don't know how many times I'm gonna have to rewatch this to actually get it. Good jod. Genius.
one of the greatest animation I've ever seen 🔥🔥
Tu mamá B)
THIS IS MARVELOUS! <3
bro made me learn more then my math teacher has-
if the math nerds got like most equations wrong no one would notice because everything was going so fast
Babe wake up, new Alan Becker video released.
AWWWW MY BRAIN IS GONE💀💀💀
POV: you're in a math exam
I just want some likes 😭😭
This is like me messing around with my calculator
1+1=2
You can make animation vs chemistry
Muy bueno
Esto me enseño mucha matematica pero ahora solo dire que no importa cuanto tarde en subir video esto es cine.🧐👌
数学的冰山一角，但足够震撼
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
animation vs physics would be glorious
Can anyone help me with the math i did?
1 11
I love math❤
Wonder when the edits of Euler vs the dark lord or smt gonna come out
this is so ggggggggggggooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddd bro please make a the sequel "Animation vs. Math 2"
Wow dude the world wants  to see that
am gonna delete this comment when it hit 69 likes
This sound library 😍 need it!
The greatest video I have ever seen       😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
As someone who just made it to 10th grade, i suddenly want to study math like crazy
Bro didn’t even times himself to make an army vs army *GASP* ALAN BECKER MAKE THAT HAPPEN!
i think we’ve all imagined some version of this in our heads
It really is a COMPLEX animation as y’all see…
From now on, my favorite subject is math❤❤
Now I feel like somebody should make a fantasy world where magic is all about real math with factions believing one must not meddle much with the ancient arts and others experimenting with it to their hearts' content, resulting and jawdropping feats and accomplishments, but also the creation of the strongest dangers and even math monsters.
after all these years who would have thought that the next challenger would be none other than the legendary warrior, e^iπ
Can we please have more stuff like this? That's more educational? Not saying to abandon things that aren't, just more of that please
Hype for animation vs meth
This animation reminded me of Portal 2 game, imagine if we had Portal game but instead of portals it's about math. Of course it would start off with simple 1 + 1 to complicated madness.
Me now : wow awesome  Me 7 years ago:☠️💀☠️💀👁👄👁
Next episode, Animation vs Python
This is one of the most epic stickman battles ever made in history...who ever thot of this is a genius
I both love and hate how accurate all the details in this are. Simply masterful.
please creat more math animation video like this  i really loved it❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
9:44 this moment is......... 😨😨😨😨😨
Alan explain all math in one video... For real its so cool, i dont know how you do it XD
I love it❤❤❤❤
one of the best things i've ever seen
Saya tidak reti bahasa kalian

This is a masterpiece..🔥🔥
Bro I love your editing keep it up 👍
Como se llama el juego xdd
how newcomers see physics class:

Bro speed runeed the whole math
hello
In an alternate universe this is hiw math is taught
凄い発想！いいアニメをありがとうございます！
A mazing good chop
This is basically the story of Ash and Pikachu
Unironically, I learned things with this. Now I am really wishing that Alanbecker make more educational themes like this one
Claramente essa animação é melhor que muitos filmes por aí 😍👏👏👏👏
Masterpiece
Круто 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Someone needs to make this a game
The fact this alien lanquage even exists is beyond me lol shows how incredibly stupid the new school systems are and the torment they put students through for even no reason that they will never use in the real world XD this is like if a alien star wars or avengers movie had subtitles when the aliens spoke their "native" language 😂  But epic video nonetheless lol i dont even wanna know how you guys made this video your poor brains must be about to explode from this evil formula 😂 🤣
Alan can you do animations vs a game called stick war  I would like to see that😁.
oh mah gosh i just learned so many math equations and problems and im only in 5th grade 💀
Kazakhstan👍
10:01 elder identity yells

guys in the and there giant thing when they walk accutaly its letter in hebrew (א)  its look the same lol
I want Animation vs Animation
Very nice video
me during my match test:
It’s these videos that make me feel small, and make me realize that the world we live in has so much more creativity and wonder to offer than what I’ve already experienced… and this was a math animation… Makes you think.
I love meth
i was able to understand it until they started fighting with math
Aprendi mais matematica nesse video do que em 10 anos de Escola
That video, thanks to which I began to understand a little mathematics
teachers: having difficulty teaching math alan becker and the lead animator: hold our beer
i am pretty sure that everything is correct, lol

This video is very interesting 😍
Richard watterson calculator game be like:
Wow simply wow😮😮😮 It is better than most of the films❤❤❤  Thank you for this creation🎉
Maths worth 20 years of education in 14 minutes 🔥🔥🔥🔥
lol
Now do a physics and chemistry one, and the trinity will be complete
Best video ever!!
This is literally 100/10. The sounds, the effects, the animation, the accurate equations and the story, they all were hella awesome. Thanks Alan.
The sound design in this is so freaking good!
Why tf did I ever stop watching your videos. This is amazing
Best math video i have ever seen
This video was amazing, can you do one like this but with music
Can i ask Will the dark lord return, but He will be stronger now or help the second coming how to use and activite his powers😮
Matematicas hijo
0:36 Damn that "0" got violated 💀
Very easy
this is definitely gonna be shown in math classes
Math baby😎
Nhìn lũ này đánh nhau mà nhứt đầu quá
At 4:22 , the exponent should say i(π - π) if it's supposed to become 0. Without the parentheses, iπ - π solves to π(i - 1), which is not 0. (also since i isn't a real number, there isn't a solution for this within the real numbers)
Can't tell how amazing it is
If math was like this,math would be more fun and better...
Genial!!
Nossa, que animação incrível!! 💯
If you say idk bye just bye
How did he (?) get here?
Thanks for showing such a great learning 😍
What’s 6x3

Why is blud fighting a letter☠️
it turned out very cool, I liked it.❤❤❤
As a math nerd, that was truly amazing.
absolutely the best thing that's made about math😂
10:02 THE WAY IT SCREAMED-
How could an alien understand math in the shortest time？ This is the answer
man i passed calc 2 and thought i was real smart
Incredible!
math speedrun to get infinity:
1+1=(1+1)^1x1+1 💯
Does Alan realise he could really submit this for an Oscar? This is beyond incredible
Animations vs mod creat minecraft
If animator is use 100% brain 😂
We are in the matrix
animation vs. chemistry please
Why isn't math taught like this?
진짜 미친놈이다
WHY IS e WANT TO RUN AWAY
この作者が小さい頃大好きだったあのアニメーター対アニメーションの人だと知って感動してる
At 11:00 is a mistake, as TSC is at the supposed center of the giant circle, but that center doesn’t appear to be centered.
Can you be my maths teacher.
Please create an episode that they discover the worldedit! 🙂 Agree? 👇👇
✨✨
Is it just me, or is this actually the best introduction to mathematics on YouTube?
Quiet kid in math class😂💀
And this is what physics looks like in the second dimension. Looking forward to "Animation vs Physics"
Ok, this is cool, now can you do animation vs music composing? I triple-dog dare you 🙂 Also, keep up the good animations and work!
perfect sound!
Thais its perfect and só COOL Pls do physic ir chemistry, that would be so COOL ❤️
never disapointed when alan becker uploads
better animation!
Your animation very good
2=158551=65258-5875588=54528558(
Just looking at this, I think I'm going to get accepted to college.
mathematically creative
This my favorite video
Имба
Huge fucking props to Egor for such incredible work with the sound design. People should start noticing that sound plays an insanely huge role in the viewer's experience.
math is incredible, but few people really get that.
Virou um genio da matemática 😮😮😮😮
😮
Only if math was so FUN just imagen
this video exactly shows how hard math gets after time
I meant to say is goo job
These videos really come o life in the world of animation.😊   Keep going Alan becker, keep following your DREAM, AND NEVER UNDER NO REASON AT ALL WILL YOU NEVER SUCCEED!!
So excellent
bros literally learning the whole primary school middle school high school and university💀💀💀
thats interesting to see how everyone sees math
Very good video. Sir Alan, I would love to see your animations vs Terraria. It would be epic!
14 year old me on my calculator when I finished the test
wait did orange learn the entirety of math in 14 minutes
Imagine the pain TSC living his whole life in 2D screen if he discovers the z-axis
That was beautiful 😍
very nice
Can u dl a face reva3l please
bro made math into a weapon
So cool💯
Bro has the infinite
The animation is so cool I even subscribed to you Alan Becker, the best animation ever 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤

This is the most beautiful video I've ever seen
Это мой новый учитель геометрии
omg, it makes me imagine that im testing some math calculations, or elae, making animation like yours :)
What animation software do you use?
Part 2
this is basically what happened between me and math but math won
Man you studied Hard for this Video. Hats Off.
Masterpiece

Math is one of my easiest subjects.
Il m’as donné mal a la tete cette episode 😂
What is the Backgroud music used here ?
The math summary
Spectacular animation! 🫡
did this guys just learn math by moving afew numbers and then creating a beam that made a crack in a whole new world?
You do this job, i love it! 😍
11 лет учёбы в школе за 14 минут
4:16 It doesn't change the end result but really it should be -cos(pi) - i*sin(pi)
My thoughts during a math test:
I understand this video.
Fine
Einsten animated with him
I... I understand maths now. I have gained knowledge. YEEESSS
If math lessons were like this, math would for sure be everyone’s favorite subject
wow
This is so cool, it's even cooler when you know the math references
deep
This is so sick zomg  ^^
??
cool animation
Something keeps pulling me back… And I don’t know what it is 🤔
🧡vs e
10:02 that is the cutest battle cry I’ve ever heard   😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
?
Math in 2077: (also you can make your own math problems)(SUPER MATH MAKER)
Mathfhobia😂😂😂
and second what if  that, Black is the "first coming", The Dark lord is the "first and a half coming", Orange is the "second coming", So that could mean Grey could be none other than the "Second and a Half Coming". but if grey has powers, than grey might be the "Second and a half coming", But i'll leave it here, You can also make YA'LL THEORIES those Commenters who are reading and yeah.
The only thing i have to sey it's just (WOW)
10:02 the one how e said
OHMYGOD THE NUMBERS WHEN SPLITTING HAVE AN EQUALS SIGN AAAAAAAAA
OHMYGOD THE NUMBERS WHEN SPLITTING HAVE AN EQUALS SIGN AAAAAAAAA
뭐야?
This is like the Richard's calculator game
That was nice
Wow thanks Alan Becker I got 100% on maths today because of your video
Hey Got 1 Question!!!.In the next episode of "Wanted" where "The Second Coming" And The "Chosen One" were Captured by Grey...it made me thinking, is gray actually and OLD FRIEND of "The Chosen One" and thats why he sent agents to capture him but then decided to capture "The Second coming" as well, Or Did "The Chosen One" when he was still friends with "The Dark Lord" attacked grey's family and thats why he wanted to capture him in the first place, seriously i cannot stop thinking about the next episode alr,i just can't
I think Im sure this video and I mixed it with spot holes on the battle with e might be epic
ALAN PLS PART TWO PLEASE PLEASE 1!1!1!!11!1!!!1!!!!!!!!!!11!1!  IT WAS THE BEST USE OF 14 MINUTES OF MY LIFE!!!!!!1!!1!!!!!1!!!!!1!!
14 minute of learning math
süüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüüü
In those 15 minutes I learned more about math than in my entire life
1 + 1 = 1
That is how I feel on math test:
nah i did not suspect a crazy animation for this ;-;
Can we all take a moment and appreciate the soundtrack?
Bro is a math expert
As soon as bro used the big Lazer effect my man was a menace to society 💀
The slower you watch this video the more details you can find. And yet, at 0.25 speed it is sometimes very fast. It is also so full of symbolism all over the place, and I don't just mean the mathematical concepts, that it is worthy of study in universities for mathematicians, animators, creatives and many more. It is a wonderful jewel.
My brain is not working…..
Amazing!!!!!
Math in school be Like:
People that like math is probably gonna be so amazed in this animation Please make this a series Alan
We need a sequel
You're telling me to analyze all these equations and rewrite and understand each one throughly even if I watch the video 100 times 😂
😲😲
This make me pass my test
As a math nerd, its animation is amazing
My love video alan
Bro beat a math equation
so excellent
And animation vs animator?
YUO ARE INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i only know 1% of everthing in this video
This is amazing❤❤❤❤
My notebook in the math class
A bit sad because Mandelbrot wasn't present. Amazing video nonetheless though!
e^iπ + 1 = 0
I decided to officially name e^i(pi), Eipi. Change my mind.
اعتقد استاذ حيدر وليد راح يدمن على هذه الحلقة 😂
I have never seen math so interesting

You need to bring the AvA- The card game back, and maybe some improvements to it for more fun!
New idea, you are the best.
This is so amazing! I love it!

From zero to Albert iq
Guys I have a theory how about that is yellow's world cuz yellow is a big brain so yellow made a world so her friends can also be a big brain?
I NOW KNOW THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE
ахуенно
28:23
an animator that knows math is that powerfull ha?
What's the name of bgm?
IS TSC DIED???
I wish math was like this, our math teacher is very angry and makes us unhappy rn :(
Hate math ticket here
Wow 9M views in 3 days
Y'know, we'll unlock the way to travel the Multiverse this way😅
my max math brain
○○にならんの？
You know the video is masterpiece when it has 9 million views in just 3 days
Did he like, come home at the end or what?
Ok  Ok  Ok  Ok  Good idea my Friend  Support for you  LOVE FOR ME 😂
waiting for animation vs physics video
"Animation vs. Musical" when?
Kalo pelajaran mtk kayak gini sih bakal seru banget 😅  Tapi sumpah ... gua ttep kagak paham 😭
1+1=2
bro made math interesting
Hey alan can you make animations verses
he just made math fun and interesting
Please make EP 32 when red and blue vs tsc green yellow
Mom: hey, you should slop watching your stupid YouTube, you should study Video on YouTube:
what is it - ie ipi
Where are the other
やっぱアランベッカーって偉大だな～🇯🇵🇯🇵
e
If math was a simulated world with a bunch of game mechanics, I'd be smarter than Einstein himself
発想も素晴らしいし、アニメーションのクオリティも高すぎる！！
It is surprisingly realistic and nothing is more exciting !! Outstanding work!! You motivated me to learn math more=)) thank u
Animation vs roblox pls
WAHHH NEW ANIMATION ... LETSS GOOO
Bro Made our big nightmare 💀
this + video + is + so = good
now math is my favorite
Wow Amazing
The +End = TheEnd
aleph in the background ❤
Ладно
Your video is very, very cool 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Congratulations! 🎉you have made me love math 😊
Alan do you know when the next AVA is coming out?
Can you make a season 4 of animation vs minecraft where the dark lord and the chosen one come back. Basically the dark lord is still alive and use's the minecraft icon to give him a power up. ❤ ❤❤ orange king, purple, red, blue, green and the second coming will have to work together ❤💙🧡💛💚 💜🧡😢😢
Wow this is really really really cool
So many math related puns and references. Another masterpiece by Alan!
What did I just saw hehh?😅🤔
The incredible content, your combination of math and animation is truly remarkable and sets your videos apart from the rest.
wow this really gave me matrix vibes
Stay in school kids, it helps make animations
The bro is just solving the 9 strings mathematical theorem
Lú hết rồi :)
This animation is masterpiece
This video is so cool bro! Keep it up❤🎉
Welcome to my school house, today we will be doing everyone’s FAAAAAVORITE subject, math
BEST THING IVE WATCHED.A
You need to give orange guy a name (not orange guy)
O just thinking how inteligent of the creator of this video . I am sure that no one can makes you understand of mathematics like this ❤️❤️❤️
You ever have beef with a math equation?
1 + 1 = ur mom
Wow Best Math Video Ever
This isn't math, this is art.
He literally can make a animation vs anything
1+1=2😅😂
Stickman becomes smarter every second
I think this is the art A.G.I. won’t be able to recreate. Or as the lines get blurred we’ll collectively shift to know what the true art is. There’s something so human in this. It’s an Iliad
I'm a pcm student it inspires me to learn more and explore maths
Ｐａｒｒｒｒｒｔｔｔ ２２２２２２２２ ｐｌｓｓｓ ｉｍ ｂｅｇｇｉｎｇ
2:49 That's why kids,don't divide any number by zero or else the universe will be destroyed
Orange legit made the death star out of maths
Matpat is gonna go crazy with this one
Orange have 9999… Iq brain and 999 Battle Iq
Imagine if chemistry lessons were like this
Math is an art
θ/r=π
You cannot describe with words, how amazing this is
I liked this vid specially when orange was fighting e whit the fonction
Ladies and jentlemen heres is the guy who invented the math
It baffles me how they turn such an abstract concept into a fully-fledged 10+ minute battle. Every clash between these numerical symbols felt so impactful. Me personally I was waiting until someone divided by zero and created a black hole or something but I think the conflict we got was so much more interesting and creative
😊😊😊❤
What's the giant gray X at the end?
Why this man gonazall something posted same video as this?
Oh my God, there is a hidden meaning here. Stickman is a unit inside this mathematical world. Therefore, he opposes e, his appearance provokes the appearance of one, and his departure at the end is equal to minus one (the last valid digit in the video)
God master
I used to love this sirys when I was a ki 12:53
Teacher: you can't learn math by a video Me: hehe
I'm reviewing it for the 3rd time, but the impressions are the same, well done! You are already a professional in this!
Ha made an absolutely insane animation with just 3 colors lol
Coolest thing ever seen❤
Ava shorts
This is truly a beautiful/amazing piece of artwork.
that is one way to learn math
7:01 I've learned the graphs of sine and cosine functions in Pre-Calculus and it's surprising to be beautifully visualized here. In the later part at 10:35, it's accurate that the bigger the radius of the circle, the higher the wave amplitude (Maybe it is as I can remember?). So far, some of these took me back to my previous Calculus lessons... and the lessons aren't over yet for now. The Euler's number that can move in its own is so cute...  I understood at the end of this video that the Euler's number made a formula with the summation (sigma) from 0 to infinity, and raised the 0 to infinity to get SC out of the Math dimension... The question is, how did SC got trapped in that dimension in the first place?
Average math exam
ant wait for AvA VI episode 2
I completely lost it when numbers gave out letters
I think this will be a very interesting new season to watch
Orange: Math Green: Geological (Earth Science) Blue: Oceanography  Yellow: Chemical Kenetic  (Since he likes to brew stuffs) Red: Biology (Study of living things)
Absolutely incredible 😍😍😍😍 I love it!!!
next, programming

The student who got frustrated by his math home work and opened youtube for a break  Sees his subscribed YouTuber uploaded. Video and he see maths in this also  Imagine
It's crazy that Alan's lead animator can make genius things in his mind in one Animation. Big W for Alan.
Math as weapons???? Huh Never think of that Part...
Attaches he did this year so many details
This is math but fun
no wonder the mathematician is the devil in computing
i like how in the beginning, euler’s identity escaped quickly, indicating a lack of fundamental understanding. But as the second coming learns more and more, he becomes more and more capable of keeping up with euler, eventually figuring out how to defeat its dimensional trickery with i, and making peace with it once he understands the prerequisites. very well done animation !!
By far the best video I've seen this year !!👏 Made my week tbh♥️
Comment
Forgot math by the point where they stop using numbers
now we have Albert Orange
I almost killed myself while watching this...
please make part two I think everybody is waiting for it
Euler is the orange guy
just wow
현실에서도 수학이 이러면 배우기 재밌을텐데..
difficult to understand😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
진정한 명작은 결말을 알아도 다시 보게 만든다
Great work
Einstein's brain:
pixar probably crying after not hiring this guy
I have to admit this was mind blowing, in every sense.
The only reason why the e attacked TSC is because he touched the e’s butt
Чувак це дуже круто😊
Hello please, I can transport your video to other platforms
=f(∞) is too op
😮OOOO
So many numbers…
Me in my sleep before an engineering comprehensive exam:
Sensei
Who is e in math
Im happy this went viral in 3 days. U and ur team deserved it. Such incredible talent. I feel like if animation and art were used to explain math, everyone would understand it and actually love it.
Alan should make a video of him going into vr and turns into a stick figure to meet the others
This is not math, this is equations for mass destruction device😅😅😅
10:19 best part   this is how much he puts in to his videos
14:02 end of timed comment hahaha nothing to see here
why the second coming so smart
Math lore
This Episode killed my brain 🧠😵‍💫
I understood pretty much nothing beyond the first few minutes of this video, but it's insane how Alan took such a creative twist on math and made this absolutely masterpiece of an animation
NEXT ONE ON PROGRAMMING PLZZZZZ
😑This is hard
We need another one !!
Esa mau jumlah i
Математика- сильнейшая наука
MY head hurts after I watch this vid
Respect + for U🙌
Iron man technology
Dear God my worst enemy. Math. I wish I could actually get better with it
simply brilliant!
Lol
i love how you represented dividing by 0 nicely
Yabe
is it only me or why do I see the letter N at the end?
Nuestro amigo naranja, hizo todo un genocidio matemático
The fact this animator (and team) is still going is beautiful. I remember seeing animator vs animations back in middle school.
Pov:figuring out what is math
cool
多分最後の音の正体はℵかな

Alan, I just had a wild idea for your next animation! How about Animation VS Electricman? If you don't know what this is, it's basically a browser stickman fighting game, just google it. It was my favourite game in the childhood, I used to play it on school computers
I just had to send this to my math teacher
too good 🔥
Valla me espera un gran problema nunca imagine que sería así las ecuaciones una detrás de la otra
Respects to alan for mermerizing a whole lifetime worth of math
Wow
Even the soundtrack has sprinkles middle eastern sounding melodies in it cuz math uses arabic numerals. I love the attention to detail.
Wow...
Most beatiful beatiful animation new animation wait Alan Becker you love
10:01 bro what is this
i love this.
I have no idea what this means, im still 5th grade
jerome polin menangis melihat ini
i love ur videos!!!
Bro learned math in 14 minutes 😮
Im pretty sure this is TSC mind, So maybe TSC brain is a asian nerd brain.
there are numbers, there sure are.
I love how takes 31 years to teach u math and this man taught is in minutes
We need this in our math classes
Alan Becker the best animator.👍
i want a math teacher to show this in class
Brains hurts
Okay hear me out: Animation vs History.
Physics vs animation please
Math would be so much easier if it was a battleground like this and everyone was rushing to find new math weapons
Matematicas si fuera mas divertido
I am starting to study math now in college, but this is to complex fot me to handle
Would love to see a part 2!
Since math has been involved, i wonder if it is possible for an Animation vs Programming 🤔
Orange just went to 1st grade to university
i would love math if it was like this  (someone should turn this into a game or smth)
Pov:you look away for 1 second What da hell
the best video you ever made
アランさんのアニメは1つ1つが映画のような迫力、躍動感で素晴らしいです！ いつも見させて頂いていますが、毎回感動しています！ これからも動画制作を頑張ってくださいね！
i want to see yellow play around in there
The sound, animation, plot, especially the creativity that this vid presented is beyond.
What does that e mean? 4:03
that number is infinite
🇦🇲🫶❤️‍🔥❗️❗️❗️❗️
I love this beautiful math
this video will break the internet
Благодаря тебе, Алан  Все будут любить математику
I don't know what the second coming want to do
5+2 ???
Hey look Alan becker is back!
Wow 😳😱😯
Bro be smarter then Albert Einstein because he taught himself math in under 14 minutes. Wait a minute. Did Alan make a smarter lifeforms than literal human beings because it only took a stick figure that has only seen math one other time under 15 minutes to master mathematical equations
I can't wait for other subjects.. this motivates students to learn. ❤
This is some of the most incredible sound design i’ve ever heard!
Over 100 1:20
what 1:12
start 0:00
I have never seen any animator better than you Alan becker,I salute you 👌👌👌.
Bro became an albert Einstein in just 14 minutes💀💀
What if sc was asian
The longger i watch, the morer i got confuse
When the teacher says you will use this in your life:
Dude, this is the best animation you've ever made.
if matrix was like math:
As long as you learn math well, you can become Doctor Strange😂
Can you make them elemental
This is my new way of thinking as to how I imagine Math duels are like.
Tsc knows noob math at beginning but at the end he learnt legend math
The music and video really go well together :0
nah bro where did blud get that iq ??
can we have "wanted" series continue?
0:36 hmm.... why does it feel a little bit sus
Susssss
at 7:00 i stopped understand  and we watch it beacuse is fun
I don't understand, but I loved the animation
:)
I didt know 80% of the calculations and yet it’s still entertaining as ever
Too many letters for me
Math in Ohio
At this point he can make anything an awesome animation
The. MATHAVERSE is real!!!!!
The Aleph Null cameo made my life tbh,
Orange is Getting Smarter of Math
So im studying cs and engineering and there’s a few things I never understood about math until now. Im a visual learner and this makes things so clear and fun. I hope math teachers show this to their students.
Only three words and these words aren't enough "this is a masterpiece"
…
8:26 GET READY TO RUMBLE!!!!!
This better be a game fr
As a rising high school sophomore, I'm scared.
Wow this is a fun way to do math
Orange learned math faster than any teen that went to school
I like to think about this being the way that math was actually discovered
what younger me would have dreamt if he knew all this math stuff
Let’s see: 0:14 the number 1, also equalities 0:27 addition  1:32  subtraction 1:42 negative numbers  1:48 Euler’s identity, in trig, a number in the form e^ix can be represented as a point on the unit circle (circle with radius one whose center is the origin on the complex plane), the x is the angle in radiants at which the point is located, since pi radiants is 180 degrees, the identity equals -1.  2:25 double negative makes positive  2:32 multiplication  2:43 division 2:57 dont divide by 0, please 3:14 positive exponents 3:38 negative exponents 3:44 rational exponents/ radicals 3:59 Imaginary numbers, normally you can’t take the principal square root of a negative number, so some old smart guy made imaginary numbers (i) where I squared is -1. 4:22 the euler identity tried to escape by multiplying itself by i, but the i that was thrown made the i into a -1, which is why when the eulers identity went through the wall, it didnt dissaper 4:25 trigonometry representation on eulers identity, sometimes written as cis (cos + isin) for anyone studying trigonometry, you know the beauty of working with complex numbers in trig form 4:31 pi radiants is 180 degrees thus the half circle 4:28 the - flipped orange guy (TSC)  5:01 the bow is made up of two twos and a multiplication sign, so it shoots out 4s 5:04 pi/4 rad is 45 degrees so the circle isn’t complete 5:26 complex plane( reals on x axis imaginary on y) 5:43 unit circle  5:50 2pi rad in circle 5:57 definition of radiant 6:12 r is radius, theta is angle 6:46 pi :) 6:52 cos and sin, and how their graphs are drawn using the unit circle. You can see on the graph that the graph cycle every 2pi, this is the period of the graph. 7:17 i rotates the sin wave 90 degrees 7:28 same eulers identity 7:43 Taylor series (complicated stuff) if im wrong plz correct me, also shoots out the answer. 7:53 circle and cylinder  8:11 TSC uses the - to go to the opposite side 8:33 complex definitions of sin and cos (rest in reply’s cause it’s getting too long)
Genius, very creative 👍👍
😵😵😵
I was thinking of this kind of concept for a while where u grab and merge numbers to form equations but in a game format, but I didn't have the ability to make something like that, thanks Alan for this amazing animation
All of this is good. The animation, the graphics, the MATH❤! But my favorite and the funniest part for me is e^i(pi)'s battle cry on 10:02! 😂😂
this vid inspired me to study math
whoever helped on the math part is asian and I know it
This is how impressive math would look like irl
Very nice😊
When the smart kid has a different answer than the other smart kid be like:
I need the background music used for this.
What about animation vs skibidi toilets :D
MATHRIX
im already at lost half way through
I love the sound design!
Alan you forgot to do 0÷0
Bro finding the clue to everything,life and finding the highest then the sun i think?
Now that’s what I call a masterpiece it probably won’t surprise me if you do Animation vs Science at some point
So great man ❤
e pensar q isso tudo começou com 1+1 kkkkkkkkkkkkk
AMAZING WORK ALAN AND YOUR TEAM!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
Remind me a bigger number than infinity
Hello youtube
Math is the Best subject ever created!!!
That’s so cool
Đây mới đúng chuẩn đấu trường toán học
I can't understand it it very hard
10^100^100^100! tanks!!!
This animation deserves a naming in the Oscar Academy Award for Best Animated Short Films. It's so beautiful, and it presents the beauty of math in a brand new way.
✋💝
dont have e=mc²
Next vid ideal : 1.8.9 minecraft pvp
Hi
Meth
yo no entender beri mucho
Why is that background music so familiar, can someone tell me where it is from
This isn't real, there is no way people made a video that made me sympathize with Euler's number. I would love to see a depiction of Kruskal's tree theorem
The test ain't that hard... the test:
Orange got that +160IQ that easily
I'm impressed on how the stick figure learned how to math in under 15 minutes
Who wants a videogame with mechanics like this?
Can someone explain all the references to Euler's identity please. It's interesting as hell but I don't understand any of it.
Damn Alan!  Now because of you I have to study math to understand the video
Jacob olivas passs. They is mi 😊 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤happy faces
How did you do the math
I wish there was more of this😢
would like to watch TSC play C60 football, and parkour on dna helix
Episode two please please please please please please please❤
Legends say that he is the that discovered math
alm mi cerebelo weii hgfds
That was . . . beautiful. 🥲
Bruh i still a kid but the math 🤔 I still don't know 😅
Mahesh dallee
🥶🥶🥶
deadly math
Vai math easy

Wtf my head hurts now
How did i achally learn something from this?????????????
😎
I know mr alan becker are genius in math
i've learned something new bout math today😅
so imaginative！！
Nahh how did you project math in adobe animate
People keep telling me that Animation requires math. This is what I'm Scared of. Cuz animation is what I wanna do for college and just watching this makes me nervous. In your mind, you picture anything that's beautifully animated It just looks Extremely Complicated for this passion and I'm afraid it's gonna be impossible to succeed this dream.
∞∞∞∞∞?
Your concept was amazing 😮.Just mind blowing .Almost all mathematical terms is here only in this 14minutes video and it was also enjoyable.😊😊😊
Mannnnnn this is awesome
This makes me love math even more
awww the end so cute :3
1
damn this is crazy
Man if you know how to use math to make it fun you need to be Smart as hell
please correct me if I'm wrong but at 10:07 is orange/tsc useing a Minecraft sheald?
Hey, that was creative with what T2C did with the multiplication symbol, i was expecting him to use it as a ninja star, but it was very clever when it was used to multiply it's speed. Bravo, Alan 👏
Reading: can read. Science: understanding how to confuse your friends. Math: make the death star
Its annoying bro
😮 wow amazing animation with math subject
Yo entendí todo hasta este minuto 3:13 Aquí mi cerebro dijo (Que¿?) la tristeza de los bachilleratos de mi pais pero díganme, hasta donde entendieron? o entendieron TODO?
¿Quien es esa e?
頭良くないと良くわかんない戦闘の仕方だな わかりそうでわからん
Why is math my favorite subject 💀
make animator vs Greek letters
Now, Animation vs Science ?
Alan eres el mejor sigue así. me dolió la cabeza de tanto pensar si las ecuaciones están bien jaja😅 pero me encantó. cada día te superas mas 😁 y pensar que veo tu trabajo desde tus primeros videos animator vs animation 🙂
math make brain go hurt owie oof
4:55 bro used his fly hacks
1+1 is 2
Idea saves animator vs animation part 2
what i dont understand so much becoase i am 12
Hi big fan
Now this movie shalt be titled "john mathematician" 😊
ART
Osea que las matemáticas habren portales:o
**opens desmos**
This is exceptional
13:40 The Giant Alef
this is how i fight math subject.
Please make a part two! 🙏
So many numbers
No entendi ni un caraj0 :V
This absolutely INSANNNEEEE BRO Good Job loved every part of it
BRO THAT WAS INSANE
i never understood math... and i still dont understand it.😅
no me canso de ver tus animaciones,son muy épicas
How much bookwork and research must they have done to figure out these equations and how to change them in so many ways?
Amazing animation 👌
Better than the flash this is amazing. Got another reason for hating math
Does this stickman making me smart 🤓 or when my teacher teach me I don't understand
Sorry I Hate Math
If this was it i would be doing e=mc2
The second coming is now the second Einstein
better than Marvel Cinematic Universe
Just amazing how he turns everything inta action
You should more like this, maybe language
Albert Einstein has been real quiet ever since this came out.
What was that giant x thing at the end
Buenísimo
Pov:your math watching this be like  Math teacher:finally a worthy opponent
Not even gonna lie but the bow looks like the spider virus
10:02 *_WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH_*
the giant thing in the back at the end of the video is a hebrew letter not math
Animation vs physics next?
41 trending for GAMING!?!? This is not gaming this is math
PART TWO PLS
Someone has got to tell me what the music is from the start
Bro’s about to start doing some quantum physics next 💀
Esto es arte en estado puro.
AHHHH MY BRAIN
the+end=the end
Math class😀
That’s soo amazing!!! That’s a lot skill math!!😂
SC is now a math genius.
Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarokatuh
alan if you guys ever decide to dabble in a bit of animation/visualization of math concepts down the line, I think its safe to say that us uni people will praise you legends for the rest of eternity.
This video was interesting. Orange learning math but moving forward he destroys it. What would we do without math?
No enteni nada xd
Idea: how about making Animation vs periodic table
This is so good i would gladly make multiple accounts to generate more likes. But i cbf.
Bro made Death Star in 6 seconds 💀💀💀 10:59
Fabulous
I'm emotional righ now and idk why
Skibidi toilet  vs animation
Plis😊
Math should be a superpower
Skibidi toilet
this is the same guy who made animation vs animator way back on newgrounds right?
i dont think you understand how much i love this channel
This video went from 1+1 to a bloody helll then a freaking bossfight without taking damage speedrun
U should add  yellow and stuff
This brings a whole new level to animation
I love math
Thanks Alan and his team! The exceptional talent of Alan and his team is evident in their ability to evoke sympathy for Euler's number, showcasing their skills on various levels.
1:39 me when letters started appearing in math
this worst good video i ever seen
I didn't expect to notice the 1024
que onda ahora tengo interes por las matematicas ;-;
When you fighting Terraria pillars 9:10
SOMEONE MAKES A GAME LIKE THIS PLEASE
If YouTube comments me I will scream until my lungs and teeth come out
Please do a collab with 3blue1brown!!! For all the math nerds!!! 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Next up Animation vs. Science where TSC literally creates a nuke!
why the plushies are sold out you don't have make more?
Dude, this video concept me a new way to view math. It's such awesome!!
Math of 1+1=2 math favorit okay ot zenou pliase😔 to be part 1 the part 2 toh
лайк
This reminded me of why I started to like math in school, before college ruined it. Feels nostalgic.
im learning maths all over again while enjoying at the same time
Wow
Where he go.
Man I dont get a THIRD of whats going om with the math there but it's pretty cool to see and I really feel inspired to learn more about math just so I can understand this video better. Everything just looks so concrete and practical when we're able to see it in a spacial representation like this
Esto es increible
university final math boss
Overjoyed. I slowed down during certain moves to appreciate whatever i missed. After reviewing it, it's a masterpiece
I think this might be the most literal definition of knowledge is power
Okay, I think I learned a bit more than what my teacher taught me four years ago...  Sorry, Sir Jason.
No inglish :(
Animation vs twitter
God
Best animation in your video!I like it!
The Second Coming: Phew, it was a dream.
The levels of creativity and mathematics manipulation required to make this video are absolutely mind-blowing.
i don’t know what just happened but it was cool
Richard lo predijo (el increíble mundo de gombal)

I still don't understand math lol
what.
Now I love maths

am i the only one here that didnt understand anything?
I learned more from this than school, literally
The math nerds are gonna have a field day with this.
So how do graphs work?
Aaaah Alan you son of a gun. I was just like, wait I wonder who the "math nerd" animation director is, and it was Terkoiz himself LOL. Coincidentally, the sound design was amazing, I was like "man only someone like Pepper could've made something like this" and LO' AND BEHOLD. XD  The old school Newgrounds/Hyun's Dojo/Stick Page gods themselves haha
I wish I could learn that fast
Basic math
This quickly went from "Hmm, we can use this to communicate our math to aliens" to "holy crap" lol
Wow
О, новое видео😊
Alan you are good at animation and bribery. Pls make a part 2 with the math "things" that we see at the end. Also a suggestion is add the other stick man people
im suprised they got through that one
If math was taught like this in school I think I would have been able to understand it better
Is part 2 coming soon?
My brain died at 2+2. Did anyone else get purple for their answer?
In a similar vein, how about animation vs physics? Really could harken back to someting like Algodoo?
Physic pls me
Please, part 2, this is AMAZING
Baldi
thanks for this animation i hope this video make everyone loves math
Вот такую математику я с радостью буду учить
Me when solving the Riemann Hypothesis: 11:03
Definitely the best series for Pythagoras and Leonhard Euler Also Hypatia and of course  Albert Einstein And ishak and and and  GIVE LIKE TO THEM
pov: a adhd person when they focus and un focus in math
Me: math is now my 3rd favorite subject (english and pe are first)
It's amazing how accurate this is and you didn't just make stuff up cause it would look cool.
Smth about aleph’s gargantuan size is so cool, it makes sense and it looks awesome. Such a cool video!
salve
I dont need to understand any of this because its so f-ing cool!!!!
Insane quality, love it!
Richard jugando en modo difícil la calculadora XD
the transgenders will say that 1+1=3
I love maths but who knew you can build cool stuff like that
just remembered that this guy made my childhood better, damn...
You know Alan has some next level stuff when he makes a story in MATH for gods sake
Man is Einstein himself
He made a gun with math
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man he is smart af
math amazing
Also i want animation vs math eps 2 where all of the characters fight zeta, phi, delta, -1(eiπ) and aleph
. 5:13
Me when I use a calculator:
THIS is the best stick figure video Alan and Co. have EVER done
Next video gonna be Animation vs physic
It was sick! This is probably one of my favorite videos from you, just another amazing animation by Alan Becker.
Math teachers will be showing this to their students for years to come.
it was really perfect
I think... my brain just melted.
queria aprender matematica na velocidade q ele aprende
what if orange could bypass those math weapons of mass destruction to anywhere he likes?
Yo quedé :0
This my favourite animation EVER
Now we need animation vs Chat GPT.
TERRARIA PLEASE
You did not make look Math that cool.
This is how our school system should teach math!
Adorei ADOREI
This looks like a fantastic video game, I want to play.
The same lesson timeless Tim had in one of his videos can be applied here, the more u f*ck around, the more you’ll find out. Change my mind
Bro put all the math lessons into one video 😮 wow
This is incredible . Alan becker can you make geometry math please that cool and a lot of theory
HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO MAKE MATH COOL
I want there to be a math class where the teacher's only goal is to make the students understand everything that happens in this video.
my🧠is 🤯
Las matemáticas, el idioma universal
BROOO IS THE RICHARD CALCULATOR GAMEPLAY
r=1일 때 cos(pi)+isin(pi)의 위력: 7:07 (위력 1배), r=100일 때 cos(pi)+isin(pi) 의 위력: 11:03 (위력 10000배)         정확하지 않으니 믿거나 말거나^^
eu na calculadora kkkkkk
Oh my god
Insane sound design
THIS IS TOO GOD DAMN COOL WHAT
Finally someone makes math more fun➗➖➕🎉 (teachers I hope you learned there)🙏👍
What if the 5 stick figures are in the 1v4 game called evolve and they played like they did that league of legends episode?
Bruh
Alen must have been studying math a lot before making thos video
A real masterpiece ! Thank you very much
I really like this can you and DJ or  whoever thought of this make another one
I showed this to my math teacher and he approved it lmao, he is gonna show it in class some day
Where do you find these sounds?? Were they made specifically for this video? or is it just some random sci-fi futuristic tech sfx pack that just so happens to contain all this?  i really want to know how scifi tech sound design (the actual synthesis of the sound, not the video editing term) is done because ive never been able to find any useful info about it
this is a great video it was cool how you guys added real and imaginary numbers but what about vectors they use both imaginary and real numbers also cosine, cotangent, tangent, sec, csc, and sin. that might be to complicated if you added that one in.
this was the most magnificent video I've ever seen
When is the next animation vs animator
So fun!
your animater sure knows a lot about math even the cosine and sine graph but does he know about the rest of the graphs.
Coolest math video ever😂😂
epic, I didn't understand anything but this was amazing
Math has never looked cooler in my life.
You should do an animation vs science but instead of tsc, it should be blue!
1+1:2
these videos always take so long to come out but they're worth the wait
This is the MOST CREATIVE ANIMATION OF THE WORLD, even the graphs and the equations are all right.
10:02 First word in history of AVM WRAAAA
Idk if yall can see it, but the reason behind the creepy noise is because there are 5 symbols not 4 (you just can barely see the grid symbol. he blends in with the backround)
Seriously, where the hell was logarithms in all this? Dude could have translated, ya'know?!  Loved the video.
This is oddly satisfying
OMG PLZ PART 2
Bro forget o out wanted we need a part two to this
Alan just made math a pvp I like it now🤓
Ye😊
incredible, you are genius 👏
if I pay attention this could probably teach me faster then an actual school
for people that are wondering what are those symbol characters in the end of the animation, there they are:  Circle with a line passing through it: Phi Curvy symbol that resembles the letter S: Zeta E with an i and a pi symbol above: Euler symbol that looks like a cutted 8: Delta Big black symbol walking in the background together with the others: Aleph Number
Very good animation and now math is definitely not as bad.
I liked how it led the math into something pretty epic.  How crazy it is to think that I started watching Animation vs Animator and now watching a math war is just epic.  PS: This could be a good mathematical and educational video game before those versions that pause the action of it.  ☕
Make euler proud again😁 This video is a peice of art
Learn math with orange❤
I got lost at 8:32, but I think he's basically just creating a function that evaulates to zero when e^i*pi is put into it
Wow
first three minutes and already better then a marvel movie
HOLY shi- math could now be a literal game people could enjoy. its insane, the topics of math presented in this battle were just brilliantly placed.
I'm too dumb to understand this episode
13:41 What are they?
i like how this goes from "ooo adding" to "IM GOING TO DESTROY YOU WITH THIS DEATH STAR
Honestly I barely understand any of this but wow this was awesome
Passionnant
This has to be the coolest piece of media ive ever seen
انه الابداع
i never thought I would see a flying equation
Easiest way to learn math
W
Like how it all came full circle.
Genuinely, this is the best one you've done period. Love all of the math easter eggs
Bro, that's fine, keep it up. Since it's a masterpiece
I think I can speak for the majority here that this animation is too big brained for us to understand
I still don't understand why when e^i(pi) multiplies itself by i, a gate is opening? Is there a specific meaning in "-i"?

My brain hurt
10:02  LOL WHO EVER MADE THIS SOUND IS SOMETHING I DONT KNOW
Alan is the Christopher Nolan of animation.
what was tht big letter at the end
Alan + support = video?
my brain kinda hurt while I was watching this. but this animation was amazing.
8:17 GAME!
I love the scene when the e thing just shouted it was so cute❤❤❤❤
This video is very good and very well animated and it’s is educational to people who watch his videos and they can learn a little math as well😁
WHY IS E SO CUTE AAAAAAAAA
👍👍👍👍👍
this animation is mathematically correct, and it feels wrong after 77+33 = 100, 9+11=21, 1+1=11 etc.
bro, this video had my head hurting
the true AVM / el verdadero AVM
This video is not good, It is awesome, brilliant. But I have one question: where did the music came from? It is also extraordinary, and it completes the animation in the perfect way.
They should of made it so 0 divided by 0 just destroys the universe
I can't believe someone could make a masterpiece with just math
11 classes of math in 15 minutes
THIS IS AMAZING!
My brain hurts
Wow….. 😮😮😮😮😮🙌 this is EPIC!
I think extra credit should go to the music score, which is very clearly inspired by The Matrix, another world well know for being full of numbers
10:58 like if you thought in ss4 gogeta preparing his big bang kamehameha x100
I am literally the enemy of math
Animation vs. Batman
The animation is fantastic but let me just refer this one time to the sound design and score. Theyre incredible.
my math teacher when he says math is exciting
I always knew math was evil
ive seen a lot of animations over my time on the internet and this is most definitely the most creative piece of animation ive ever seen, just another day for alan becker
I've never seen such amazing animation before  This animation is beautiful
amazing
There is no part2 right? Cus you showed as all the math what is it... anyways im still hating integrals lol
Bro i am disappointed that there wasnt a rubics cube appearance
I hope you’re a big Brainer because this is going to be a lot of… math. And big blasters.
11:25 turning on light mode🗿
Looks like someone read Marco the Great and the History of Numberville…
My math teacher would love this!
𝜋  great video!   𓂀   ∞    ð    Ω    ω    ζ    ☉
the fact that this math is accurately shown is unbelievable XD
Everyone is talkin about the math part or the animation being awesome and dont get me wrong I dont say they are not worth talking about but I think we should talk about the sounds as well. The sound desing, little blips and bloops and the background music are all extremely good as well. Without them, this would still be a peak animation, but with the sounds it goes from extremely good to a masterpiece in my opinion
2222222222222222222222222222222222222
Why didn’t my math teacher show this instead
math prepares you for everything in life  *a thief enters my house* Me: 8:30

where is the black man?
I LOVE YOU💝😁
yeah i took math in spe but i will work on it....yes...
This is the best video
2:55 this is why you never divide by 0
okay everything was cool and all but can we talk about that cannon he made oh my god
i really hope we see more development on some of the characters at the end because this is cool as hell
C'est incroyable !
Based on the ending, I think we can expect Animation vs. Math 2 sometime in the future.
This man can make anything a fight
This animation is sick 💯
Why it’s it a new super 👍
רק אני שמתי לב שיש בסוף את האות א?
13:22 that formula: 2^n and (infinity/2). I thought "Why there is 2? There is need to be 9." But. This is 2D reality! Alan, you are crazy!)
א
Props to Orange for making a perfect circle
Make a mobile game of it !!
Edit: this is a great animation and even if I don’t understand the beyond complicated stuff I can understand the amount of effort and time that is needed to make something as incredible as this  Why is this version of math so darn complicated? It’s so limited and feels like it’s too stuffy
Awasome! Incredible job man, impressive animation and really fun, congrats!
This is incredible congratulations 👏
My mind be like: π¹+π¹
I've never seen anyone have so much fun with math!
THIS IS THE BEST ANIMATION YOUVE MADE THE TIME AND EFFORT THIS IS SOOOOOOO GOOOD
the battle cry at 10:02 makes me laugh every time
arka plan  daki  müziğin  ısmının adı ne
Talent, Idea, Creativity, Simplicity, Knowledge, Experience, Wisdom, Art  i didn't saw this much creative animation movie, it's just simply out if the box!
I can watch this a thousand times 💯
bro has all the concepts clear in maths
12:24 is the best part ×d
imagen having math class like this
Please make more if possible, this is incredible work. As someone who isn't knowledgeable on math, I've genuinely never seen some of these concepts pictured like this, ever. But its much easier to understand at least intuitively in an animation like this. Needing to keep things simple so things can be animated and clear, plus not having dialogue, or even text to explain are the limits that make this a really effective educational tool. It helps that the sound design and music is very satisfying. Great work, seriously, must have taken ages.
The best video I've seen in history incredible
⅛
Amazing
Alan managed to make math interesting and at the same time fun
The only time when math is based
I did not think that the entire school curriculum in mathematics could fit in a video.  and I have a question.  will it be possible to buy more plush toys of your characters?  Or is it exclusive?
❤
1+1=2
Another masterpiece animation🔥🔥
i could see this as an enjoyable form of education
This would be a great vidoe to use to make teens more engaged in math
Do chemistry next
i've always imagined math as a battle between numbers.
make science next
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OH MY GOD
Math and math
Вау, это просто шедевр , раньше математика казалась мне скучной, но вы переосмыслили моё понимание в математике..она такая невообразимая , а эти гигантские значения- что-то с чем-то...кажется, я полюблю математику..Ваш видеоролик гениален...
Love math❤

How to learn math like a cool kid😎
tiktok brought me here by accident
my calculator when i flip the phone:
I don't want to imagine how much effort Alan's team put in to make everything mathematically correct
Mad respect!!
amazing
Loved the way knowledge flows through my brain without staying
I am never going to sleep tonight after watching this video. Thanks to you, I'm going to study for the next month.
09:57, that one kids think he is the best after his mom say you are the best:
Math is now mathing
Oh we HAVE to get a code language versus now. This is beyond outstanding, and imagination is truly limitless.
What it feels like messing with the calculator when bored
Orange in this world: 🤓🤓🤓
Is this a collab with 3brown1blue?
Do the part 2 its sooooooo gooodd
This is both creative and lazy
it was cool, no words, big like and it was amazing video, just cool
we all are vs math sometimes
This would be an insane VideoGame 😅

The best animation ever!
This is really cool!
Hello Alan
Cool!
this is what it feels like when you're 10 and messing around with a calculator lmao

Bro is teaching people divison a fractions
the scream tho 💀
where red yellow green and blue :(
Я удивляюсь как Алан придумывает свои идеи, дайте ссылку где он покупал вещества которые дают такой же эффект                                         (Люди Я сказал это в шутку если что)
This video is so cool            But I still hate math
I have a question will we see more of eipie in the future
I hope future math professors will show this to explain some of the topics because I understood more in a 14 min video than in 3 years of middle school  Plus this is epic!

Esto si es voletoso
Explanation of some of the mathematics in the video. Second part, from minute 03:48 to minute 04:34. Spoiler Alert. Second part: 03:48 And what will be and what is the meaning of the root of -1? √(-1) 03:50 And i appears. Discovery of the complex numbers ℂ. i is the imaginary unit, i = √(-1). The complex numbers were created to find the solution of x^2 + 1 = 0, which has no solution in the reals. Then it was discovered that, with that very abstract concept of mathematicians, many physical phenomena were explained, such as electricity and electromagnetism, which cannot be explained only with real numbers 03:54 The complex unit we can add: i + i = 2i 03:57 And we can also multiply it: i.i = -1. And this is related to minute 03:48 where we saw that √(-1) = i, therefore i.i = -1 03:59 If we multiply it 3 times by itself, i.i.i = -i. But -i = i.e^(iπ). So Animation, with the understanding of complex numbers, discovers where Euler's Identity had been hiding. Euler's Identity multiplied itself by i to rotate -90° in the complex plane, because multiplying by i rotates -90°. For example, starting with 1: 1.i = i, i.i = -1, i.i.i.i = -i, and i.i.i.i.i = 1 (back to the beginning). Curious note. In the reals, multiplying by -1 causes positive numbers to become negative and vice versa. From the point of view of complexes, this is actually a -180° rotation, because -1 is actually i.i. 04:08 Euler's Identity, fearful, flees, but in its flight it loses the i that multiplied it, that makes it appear again on the real line at -1: e^(iπ) = -1. 04:10 Animation grabs the i that he dropped to Euler's Identity, and throws it to him. 04:12 Euler's Identity, which is now in the reals, multiplies itself by i to escape again from the real line, and does so, rotating -90° in the complex plane, it is now at i 04:14 But on being hit by the i that threw Animation at it it returns to the real line, but on the other side of it with the value of 1: i.i.e^(iπ) = i ².e^(iπ) = (-1).e^(iπ) = (-1).(-1) = 1, let's look at this in steps: 1. Euler's Identity is e^(iπ) = -1. 2. At minute 01:44 it multiplied itself by i to escape Animation, and was left at -i: i.e^(iπ) = -i, or seen in another way, i(-1) = -i 3. At minute 03:59, Animation discovers where it is hiding by multiplying i by itself 3 times i.i.i = i ².i = (-1).i = -i, but -i = i.e^(iπ) 4. In its escape Euler's Identity loses the i that multiplied it, returning to the real plane: e^(iπ) = -1. 5. Euler's Identity tries to escape back to the complex plane by multiplying itself by i: i.e^(iπ) = -i 6. But it is overtaken by the i that threw it Animation: i.i.e^(iπ) = i ².e^(iπ) = (-1).e^(iπ) = (-1).(-1) = 1 7. In summary, She was hiding in -i, when she lost the i that multiplied her she was -1, when she multiplied herself by i to escape she was again -i, and when she multiplied herself by the i that Animation threw at her she was 1. All these are rotations in the complex plane, remember that multiplying by each i rotates -90° in the complex plane 04:15 Animation catches Euler's Identity, but it temporarily becomes Euler's Formula: e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sin(x). In the video he uses this formula with x = π: e^(iπ) = cos(x) + i sen(iπ), but since originally Euler's Identity was multiplied by the minus sign, in the end it remains:  - e^(iπ) = - ( cos(π) + i sin(iπ) ) 04:01 Euler's Identity grabs the minus sign that was multiplying it and throws it to Animation. 04:08 When the minus sign reaches Animation, it causes it to change sign, and causes it to rotate 180 degrees (In the reals, multiplying by a minus sign causes a number to change direction, positives become negatives and vice versa, and if we look at it like in the complexes, multiplying by the minus sign is multiplying by -1, which in turn is multiplying by i ², and the latter is a rotation of -180°, i.e., you go half a turn. 04:21 Euler's Identity gets rid of π, subtracting π- π, and that makes the angle of rotation zero, so it rotates, in the complex plane, from - 1, where it is to 1. Although we can also see it as any constant, non-zero, raised to zero gives 1: e^(i.(π- π) = e^(i.0) = e^0 = 1. Once you get to 1, Euler's Identity runs off to the right. 04:27 Animation grabs the multiplication sign and the constant i, and chases Euler's Identity. 04:32 Animation uses the multiplication sign on itself and multiplies its velocity 04:34 Animation throws a minus sign at Euler's Identity and starts a deadly fight between them. And we come to the end of Part 2
Alan, what about a "Stick figure x Terraria" animation?
This is the best jam I've ever seen! A slice of storytelling, a spoonful of animation and a jar full of an academic subject were all put together to produce this delicious jam for anyone willing to watch, learn and understand. Congratulations to the whole team! DAAMMMMN! Real Good :)
teacher: tells mathematics for 11 years. meanwhile author: tells math in one video

my guy is a literal stick figure and yet somehow he still smarter than me
If math were this easy
Was I the the only one who got an add for a school that only focuses on math while watching this
Euler’s number (e) really reminds me someone from a very old video…
This guy taught me The whole entirety of maths in 14 Minutes and a school teaches me the whole entire maths in 6 years
I dont normally comment on videos, but the sheer time, dedication, and artistic and mathematical talent displayed in this video is mind boggling. Truly incredible work!
2:48, como que dividir entre cero ☠️
I was waiting for  ( ln ) the whole time ...
I am now educated
Bro made a boundless character😂🎉
Retiro lo dicho mi materia favorita es Matemáticas
someone was watching lemnismath
Matemática avançada d+ entendi nadakkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Explicación de parte de las matemáticas del video. Segunda parte, desde el minuto 03:48 hasta el minuto 04:34. Spoiler Alert. Segunda parte: 03:48 ¿Y cuál será y qué significado tiene la raíz de -1? √(-1) 03:50 Y aparece i. Descubrimiento de los números complejos ℂ. i es la unidad imaginaria, i = √(-1). Los complejos fueron creados para encontrar la solución de x^2 + 1 = 0, que no tiene solución en los reales. Luego se descubrió que, con ese concepto tan abstracto de los matemáticos, se explicaban muchos fenómenos físicos, como la electricidad y el electromagnetismo, que no pueden ser explicados solo con números reales 03:54 La unidad compleja la podemos sumar: i + i = 2i 03:57 Y también la podemos multiplicar: i.i = -1. Y esto está relacionado con el minuto 03:48 donde vimos que √(-1) = i, por lo tanto i.i = -1 03:59 Si la multiplicamos 3 veces por sí misma, i.i.i = -i. Pero -i = i.e^(iπ). Así Animación, con el entendimiento de los números complejos, descubre dónde se había escondido la Identidad de Euler. La Identidad de Euler se multiplicó a sí misma por i para rotar -90° en el plano complejo, porque al multiplicar por i se rota -90°. Por ejemplo, comenzando con 1: 1.i = i, i.i = -1, i.i.i = -i, y i.i.i.i = 1 (volvemos al principio). Nota curiosa. En los reales, multiplicar por -1 hace que los números positivos se conviertan en negativos y viceversa. Desde el punto de vista de los complejos, esto en realidad es una rotación de -180°, porque -1 es en realidad i.i 04:08 La Identidad de Euler, temerosa, huye, pero en su huida pierde la i que la multiplicaba, eso hace que aparezca de nuevo en la recta real en -1:   e^(iπ) = -1. 04:10 Animación agarra la i que se le cayó a la Identidad de Euler, y se la lanza 04:12 La Identidad de Euler, que ahora está en los reales, se multiplica por sí misma por i para escapar de nuevo de la recta real, y lo hace, rotando -90° en el plano complejo, ahora está en i 04:14 Pero al ser alcanzada por la i que le lanzó Animación regresa a la recta real, pero por el otro lado de ésta con el valor de 1:  i.i.e^(iπ) = i ².e^(iπ) = (-1).e^(iπ) = (-1).(-1) =  1, veamos esto por pasos: 1. La Identidad de Euler es e^(iπ) = -1 2. En el minuto 01:44 se multiplicó a sí misma por i para huir de Animación, y quedó en -i:   i.e^(iπ) = -i, o visto de otra manera, i(-1) = -i 3. En el minuto 03:59, Animación descubre donde está escondida al multiplicar i por sí misma 3 veces i.i.i = i ².i = (-1).i = -i, pero  -i = i.e^(iπ) 4. En su huida la Identidad de Euler pierde la i que la multiplicaba, volviendo al plano real: e^(iπ) = -1 5. La Identidad de Euler trata de escapar de nuevo al plano complejo multiplicándose a sí misma por i: i.e^(iπ) = -i 6. Pero es alcanzada por la i que le arrojó Animación: i.i.e^(iπ) = i ².e^(iπ) = (-1).e^(iπ) = (-1).(-1) =  1 7. En resumen, Estaba escondida en –i, al perder la i que la multiplicaba quedó en -1, al multiplicarse a sí misma por i para escapar volvió a quedar en –i, y al multiplicarse por la i que le lanzó Animación quedó en 1. Todo esto son rotaciones en el plano complejo, recuerda que multiplicar por cada i rota -90° en el plano complejo 04:15 Animación atrapa la Identidad de Euler, pero ella se convierte temporalmente en la Fórmula de Euler:   e^(ix) = cos(x) + i sen(x). En el video usa esta fórmula con x = π:    e^(iπ) = cos(x) + i sen(iπ), pero como originalmente la Identidad de Euler estaba multiplicada por el signo menos, al final queda:  - e^(iπ) =  - ( cos(π) + i sen(iπ) ) 04:01 La Identidad de Euler agarra el signo menos que la estaba multiplicando y se lo lanza a Animación 04:08 Cuando el signo menos alcanza a Animación, hace que cambie de signo, y hace que rote 180 grados (En los reales, multiplicar por un signo de menos hace que un número cambie de dirección, los positivos se convierten en negativos y viceversa, y si lo vemos como en los complejos, multiplicar por el signo menos es multiplicar por -1, que a su vez es multiplicar por i ², y esto último es una rotación de -180°, es decir, das media vuelta. 04:21 La Identidad de Euler se deshace de π, restando π- π, y eso hace que el ángulo de rotación sea cero, por lo tanto rota, en el plano complejo, desde - 1, donde está hasta 1. Aunque también lo podemos ver como cualquier constante, diferente de cero, elevada a cero da 1: e^(i.(π- π) = e^(i.0) = e^0 = 1. Una vez llegado a 1, la Identidad de Euler huye por la derecha 04:27 Animación agarra el signo de multiplicación y la constante i, y persigue a la Identidad de Euler 04:32 Animación usa el signo de multiplicar en sí mismo y multiplica su velocidad 04:34 Animación lanza un signo de menos a la Identidad de Euler y comienza una pelea mortal entre ellos Y llegamos al final de la Parte 2
Alguien estuvo viendo mucho lemnismath
Now do animation vs meth.
why was he fighting with the imaginary number?
I think Alan Becker should do Animation vs Science next
في عرب هون ؟
10:30 as soon as I saw this I thought he was gonna pull a Red and make a giant stick figure lmao guess we gotta wait till Animation vs Math 2 ig
This shows that infinity will never be understood ❤

ты преисполнился в анимациях и звуках!
Animation vs nuestra peor pesadilla
como gran amante de las matematicas, me encanto. Llegue a entender hasta la parte en que pi se dividio en el cos y el sin, Alan Becker nunca decepciona
Amazing stuff 😮
Very nice visualization.
This is god level creativity
If I didn't learn this before I die, then I won't die.
😡Vs😈
I was wait the   0÷0
Крутое видео. А можете пожалуйста сделать также, только с русским языком? Cool video. Can you please do the same, only with Russian?
Orange:its big brain time
Wow. This is very nice
1+1=11
I understand everything... well more or less
Nice animation
13:46 DA REVEAL OF ALEF!
Awsome 👌🏻🤩
bişi anladıysam namussuzum .d
Some time i think you can reache demon slayer's level of animation
❤❤
Nice 👍🏻
Wow estuvo super
I bet that little orange stickman is asian!!
Love this animation :)  Edit: oops forgot to click the bell when i subscribed hehe
I’m stupid- what does the e i pie thing mean- and why does it keep showing up- and how does it have powers to make portals- my head hurts lol-
I got an idea for video animation vs south park and another idea is animation vs Roblox 1st Alan brecker
I am always impressed how good editor and cartoonist Alan becker you are great
0:01 Orange: WHAT THE HELL I AM ON?? 0:06 Orange: bro there is only a one 0:21 Orange: ima form a number.. 0:26 O: Free protein 0:28 O: AIN'T NO WAY DUD! 0:31 O: wow i am starting to stack numbers! 0:33 O: ohh yeah.. --- And this how math orange started to grow up.. --- 0:36 O: E 0:41 O: aint it's a deadheads 12 0:45 O: wait i can duplicate more numbers 0:49 O: i found out that 12 + 2 is a 14 0:51 O: ACK!! 0:55 O: old moment 0:59 O: YESSS I DID TO 100 *while the numbes are the gods of the orange stickman* 1:08 O: it feels odd. 1:11 O: *sits* *40 has been formed* 1:15 O: I am gonna form a 9/11. 1:19 O: i am powerful rn.. 1:22 O: a minus??

Math is my favorite subject ❤
dam orange goin ham with math holy crap
Yeah, I’ll understand this once I finish school.
As someone who doesn’t get want is mostly happening in this, I find it to be very enjoyable
yo y los reales esperando un nuevo animation vs minecraft🤑🤑
If dublication would be as easy as it is here...
The thumbnail: “Let’s learn basic math.”  The end of the video: “Want to re-evaluate your world view?”
Love how i was actually calculating every equation while watching
God this is so fucking cool. To see the principles I've learned in my time at college and even studying physics be applied in such a creative way while also making perfect sense is jaw dropping
Please part 2
this is what happends when ur 5th grade looks like this is why i hate number's plus my brain is dying bc of the nerd who so smart as heck
Math in animation:🗿🍷 Math in real life:🤓
never did i ever think math could be this epic
Oh we definitly need a game like that. Based all on math. Probably one exists already and i do not know about it ://
I have to say, i was fully expecting a division by zero attempt to result in an infinite paradox that somehow kickstarted the conflict
He’s starting to believe
Didn't know math can be so dangerous
Great!
Its crazy how Alan Becker took a simple concept like stickmen and turned it into something incredible wow
Legends say that he bought the entire math.. and he's the most smartest char to be in 2023.. depends who is he....
Can this be turned into a video game
Ala ya se el número por mc fraccionado por infinito s
This Is a perfect material for a gane
الدافور النهائي
eeeeeeeeees AWESOME
This is fantastic 😮❤
don't forget the fact that it's all from MATHEMATICAL stuff...
i never knew that math was that interesting
Bro just made math more interesting
hold up- the giant guy at the end is א? thats interesting.. i wonder why "א" is here. (its from the hebrew language by the way.)
What kinda tony stark lookin
4:01 i dont get the math anymore at this point
Prof: guys i Made a super easy test for you. The test:
$৹ ₵৹৹İ
That's how I am in mathematics
truly epic
It just keeps getting better and better!

WoW! 😮 Love it!
I love math!
Can someone help me explain what the idea behind e^(iπ) always running away or fighting is? I guess there's something to it and I'm curious.

Omg 😮😮😮
Mind blowing🤯
Keep it up! 👍
This video is truly amazing one of my favourites
dang i feel like a nerd
una pregunta  puedo asé  mi dibujo que te vivo
I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest appreciation for the incredible animation you created on Euler's number and its profound connection to mathematics. I was truly astounded by the level of artistry and intellectual depth that your work displayed.  Your animation was nothing short of a masterpiece, seamlessly blending intricate mathematical concepts with captivating visuals. From the very beginning, it was evident that meticulous attention to detail had been invested in every frame. The fluidity of motion, the vibrant color schemes, and the careful use of symbolism all contributed to an immersive experience that left a lasting impact on my mind.  What struck me most about your animation was the seamless integration of Euler's number into various mathematical contexts. The way you depicted its significance in calculus, differential equations, and exponential functions was both enlightening and awe-inspiring. You managed to transform abstract mathematical concepts into a visual language that was not only accessible but also visually stunning.  Furthermore, your animation displayed a remarkable ability to distill complex ideas into concise yet meaningful visuals. The clarity with which you illustrated the relationship between Euler's number and compound interest, growth rates, and natural phenomena was truly commendable. You managed to strike a balance between simplicity and sophistication, making it a valuable resource for both novices and experts in the field of mathematics.  Beyond the technical brilliance of your animation, I was captivated by the intellectual depth it embodied. It reminded me of the sheer beauty and elegance inherent in mathematics, and it reignited my passion for exploring the intricacies of the subject. Your work served as a powerful reminder that mathematics is not merely a collection of formulas and equations but a profound language that unlocks the mysteries of the universe.
Eprst
What a love letter to math...
add a part two mate let oranges friends be with in the m a t h
I wish I could learn math like that
I just remembered everything I forgot in math class in like 15 mins
That was awesome! Thanks to all the people who were involved in this! As a 1st-year student in computer science, I find that I can comprehend approximately half of the material, which is quite surprising to me cause math at my university is not so strong.
all i know is 1+1 is 🐟
Alan berker please make a movie or a series wirh this it has The potential of a successful saga believe me
Dear Allen Becker I know how much potential your "Animation vs Math" has to become one of the most best video game s that would ever be created. Pls ask some game companies to turn this into a game.  By your great and good fan ;)
animation vs meth
now this make math mor interesting
Part 2 please ITS amazing
this should be turned into a video game.
I copied this video
And just like that.  You have genius!
this dude is a math teacher
When the Riemann zeta function shows up at the end, be prepared for a bloody sequel
Nobody gonna talk about the huge X at 13:46?
1+1=11
Hai kak Alan... Salam dari Indonesia.. Kak animation nya..yang wanted-animator  vs animation vi-ep ke 2 nya kapan kak.. Saya tunggu kak..  Semangat kak membuat vidio animation nya kak... 😄😄😊
The most beautiful video I’ve ever seen in my life….
Can you bring purples dad in the 4th season?
11:06 bro just remade the minecraft block with its giant laser
Bro summoned Euler's family💀💀💀
This is perhaphs the most imaginative way to tell everyone about the imagination in maths itself  Thanks Alan.
Mmmmmmmm what.
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
Didn’t get a thing but it’s very interesting and epic🔥
Trop drole merci 😂😂
That's mental
Well I loved it. I have no idea that was happening, but I loved it. I feel like I’d appreciate this more if I understood half the equations they were throwing at each other. Is this what physicists envision them they're in a debate?
Sound effects are op
Imagine having a calculator like this
You know, I like music the most😮
But is not animation is The Second Coming Vs Math
Que buen video me sorprende este youtuber
Bro just made the Death Star
Baldi: now this is my fvaoirte alan becker video of all time
I somehow understood everything from this video
only alan becker to make the most boring thing in existence something cool
That was a great animation
Best since 11:6
really incredible. huge smile :D
Now do one for chemistry please.
Thanks of alan
🤍🤍
I like alan creating this but the math cracked so no problem The video its like a game of surviving from these e and the mech is taking a ∫ and the mech is a boss that is hard to win
SCIENCE IS NEXT
So true Funny how it seems Always in time But never in line for dreams Head over heals when toe to toe This is the sound of my soul This is the sound
It’s a game or math?
Saw clips of this on tiktok and ran right over! Absolutely phenomenal
Col
continue with math pls
Me: Math is too hard! My Grades in math and my mom: A+, You are smarter ngl.
me volaste la cabeza.... que esplendido video bestiallllllll
From 1:39 eⁱπ is alive and the mech... He created it and the r(radius) is moving
Bro created the death star from star wars💀💀
We vs the maths teacher when she says maths easy work 😂
Will there be a sequel to this?
What is the giant in the back at the end of the vid 😮
bro let his intrusive thoughts win💀
Х
aleph null the giant
Math 🧮 was always my favorite subject but combine that with your animation skills it’s incredible
Parents: youtube cant help with your math The youtube:
looks like theyve agreed to their own terms 12:25
THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN ANY EPIC FIGHT
и как понять что только что произошло......
1+1=11
I have never seen math this amusing
Mano...
So In the+end I saw That there Is a big ℵ And a ϕ And a δ And a ζ
Oh, my brain
The whole entire DOOM series be like:
bro asked chatgpt to explain the entire maths textbook💀
that's simply amazing
This are always my thoughts in  a maths lesson😂
East or west alan becker is the best
????? What just happened ??????
How do you find motivation for this
ඞ
Like for part 2 👇
This made my brain explode
We need this in game.
Ea pio material da escola 😢😢😢
I think it takes place after animator vs animation 6  part 1 wanted
Eu não gosto de matemática 😔 eu o deio matemática
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
This is absolutely brilliant!
SUBSCRIBED!!!!
Animation vs intruder Roblox
radius,c,pi all the math
Ok isso foi incrível
They managed to capture the most annoying ability of Euler's number, that being that once you know what it is it starts just appearing in your problems out of nowhere
Do animation vs chess
Hi, I'm from Malaysia
it's incredible how Alan can make something so boring, complex, and difficult something really cool
The math that i have in math class be like
This is frickin incredible
Amante de las matemáticas y amante de la animación 😌🤯
I’m not exactly sure what I just witnessed
Very very good bro, i very like your video. My name is Thong, i’m from Viet Nam
What an amazing animation. Who thought u could learn from something like this. Freaking amazing.
Der Profi am start🎉

Cara qualquer matemática vai amar essa animação. 😂
This is fucking Amazing!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
16 years later to now
Wonder when Numberphile will do an episode analyzing this video.
simple mente epico
BRO, U R INSANE!!!
hopefully this will get a sequel
beautiful
keren anajay, akayak nonton bioskop!!!
SMH can’t believe he broke math now I can’t use being a math prodigy as a kid as an excuse for being bad at reading/writing.
War math
Haci hasta yo me interesó en mate
My math professor loved this video! Please more videos like this in the future!
Bruh a stickman is smarter then me 😢  All my studying did not pay off
это успокаивает душу!
This is probably better then I expected…it might be better then most of Moro’s animations..if you know him don’t be mad at me I  am just saying and btw math has always been my favorite subject
eiπ＝-1
This is true art ❤
How'd tsc get there anyways
You are out of this world!!!
❤❤❤
No one can beat the all mighty ∆
We're solving math problems
the second is a genius😌
Now I know that the author is a professor of mathematical sciences
Now The orange is now a genius
Man, burn my brain, its not even working but still hurts. I hate functions, i allways did.
I understood only like half of it, but one of the greatest animations
Isso é uma Obra Prima da tecnologia digital 👺
Até o yt vê os vídeos do cara
I got no enemy in almost final part be like:
1 vs many but it Alan and math version be like:
my thoughts in math class :D
YouTube Dev?
I'm sure, some of the people after watching it will spend their time playing calculators 😮.
Tontonan guru matematika=
The only math lesson thats interesting
This is so cool!
I was lost after the imaginary numbers 😅😂 but it was incredibly interesting to watch nonetheless!  I wish this was shown in math class, because then many more including myself would have actually paid attention :) This is amazing!!
= ?
As a high level University Math student, this is so beautiful! Please make a part two, but with Physics.
this is an example of what my feeble mind can't comprehend
Orange is storg🎉
Dudes taught me things that school couldn't teach me in my whole life☠️
So class as you can see math is badass in situataion
as a somewhat-of-a-mathematician, i did not understand all of this, but it still felt so good to watch! everything was so satisfying, kudos to your team for making.. whatever this is.
DUDE U MADE MATH LOOK COOL? NAH DUDE IMA BE STUDYING MAD HARD NOW
OMG....SOOOO good
What math teachers expect from us using math:
1+1=?
Domain expansion
Next animation. Animation VS languages so uou can do a video for every language
If you made a math video like this at school, you would have liked math.
Super cool video
Am I Dreaming Or Is Aleph Null Really Big
OMG THIS IS THE BEST THING I'VE SEEN

I really don't understand math, but I just realized now after watching this video that math is complicated and very beautiful
10:02
Que hermoso final... 🎉🎉🎉
if math lessons where like this im sure that everyone would like to be an engineer, funny enough im in my second year of industrial engineering and it helped me to understand some stuff, awesome job
Please, what is the name of this Song? 😍 Anyway this is a Masterpiece, maths was one of my fav. lesson when I was into school, and today still learning it 😁. Perfect video! ❤️
Masterpiece 🎉
This deserves a sequel, amazing 🤩
You lost me after 1+1=2
Pov: Newton's mind
bro this is insane
If this is experienced by someone who doesn't understand math, this will definitely be the most terrible nightmare in his life😅😅

I have an idea for the next one:  Animation vs Memes
Omg the best vid yet keep up the good work!
Hey can you make  Animation vs English please?
From this video, I learned more than from 7 years in school
Wait hold on, you mean to tell the animator for this is the legendary Terkoiz? Wow
Wow, your animation is awesome bro
I dont understand why TSC is fighting e^i(π). e^i(π) most likely saw TSC as some alien creature with unknown intentions, so he ran away and didn't try to hurt TSC, the second coming then tried everything his power to bring e^i(π) back where when he did. e^i(π) growled at him, but then tried to run away again without attacking. TSC then tried to attack him and hold him down and all e^i(π) wanted was to go away and be left alone.  Why is TSC trying to fight e^i(π) if it never did anything wrong?
10:02
it's just perfect
math dimension
You are a genius! I love it
😮
this has the same energy as that one "sans" fight animation made by NCHProductions
yellow is gonna have a field day with this
我第一次来youtube
Idea: animation vs pizza tower
animation is very amazing
е
Now make Animation vs. Geometry Dash LOL
i just watched a stick figure do math, fight math, attempt to incenerate math, AND befreind math all within 14:03
Some of my favourite things from this masterpiece I noticed:  1:39 e^iπ = -1 1:49 Multiplying by i probably can be represented here as moving to another dimention (of complex numbers) as they're located in a real one 2:37 The division here for a÷b=c is interpreted as "c is how many times you must subtract b from a to get 0" which easily explains later why you can't divide by 0 3:08 The squared number is literally interpreted as a square-shaped sum of single units 4:12 The e^iπ tries to run away to another dimention again by multiplying itself by i but TSC hits it with another i so i×i=-1 returns it back to real numbers 4:16 The e^iπ extends itself according to Euler's formula 4:19 TSC gets hit with minus so he flips 4:22 The reason why e^iπ rides a semicircle comes from visual explaining of e^iπ=-1. e^ix means that you return the value of a particular point in complex plane which you get to through a path of x radians counterclockwise from 1. Therefore e^iπ equals to -1 because π radians is exactly a semicircle. When the e^iπ sets itself to 0 power (e^i0) it returns back to 1 through a semicircle because well 1 is zero radians apart from 1. 4:46 When "+1" and "-1" swords cross they make a "0" effect 4:48 The e^iπ makes a "-4" sword which destroys TSC's "+1" sword making it zero, and as a result e^iπ is now holding "-3". Then the same thing repeats with "-3" and "-2". 4:53 The "2×2=" bow shoots fours 4:55 As I explained above, e^(iπ/4) means you move exaclty π/4 radians (quarter semicircle) counterclockwise 5:06 When you multiply a number by i in complex plane you just actually rotate the position vector of this number 90° counterclockwise, that's where a quarter circle came from 5:39 Each segment here is a radian, a special part of a circle in which the length of the arc coincides with the length of the radius (it's also shown at 5:46); the circle has exactly 2π radians which you can visually see is about 6.283 6:38 Visual explanation of π radians being a semicircle 6:48 Geometric interpretation of sinusoid 7:08 TSC once again multiplies the sine function by i which rotates its graph 90° 7:36 The sum literally shoots its addends so the value of n increases as the lower ones have just been used; you may also notice that every next addend gets the value of n higher and higher as well as extends to its actual full value when explodes 7:45 TSC multiplies the circle by π so he gets the area and can use it as shield 8:04 TSC uses minus on himself so he comes out from another side 8:17 The sinusoid as a laser beam is just priceless 9:02 Multiplying the radius by π here is interpreted as rotating it 180° 9:23 +7i literally means 7 units up in complex plane 9:38 Here is some kind of math pun. TSC shoots with infinity which creates the set of all real numbers (ℝ). With every other shot he creates another set which represents as ℝ², ℝ³ etc. It also means span (vector) in linear algebra and with every other ℝ this vector receives another dimention (x₁, x₂, x₃ etc.). 9:58 The sum monster absorbs infinity (shown as limit) and receives an integral from 0 to ∞ 13:34 The golden ratio (φ) when approaching e^iπ takes smaller and smaller steps which shorten according to the golden ratio (each step is about 1.618 shorter than the previous one) 13:46 Aleph (ℵ) represents the size of an infinite set so is presented here as enormously sized number
I wish math was this fun
Hes in The App Math
Chemistry or physics when
He had the high IQ to get a dead meme
Ngl thats good
as a math nerd, i love this
∞ + ∞ = 16
Repetition of mathematics from the first to the second grade.
终于上到油管啦！！！
"How much of this math do you know?" After watching this animation? Noting.
Bro just did simple math insted of caring where the heck he was or either his friends
1+1=2 i know math😁
Wow! Who knows what’s next??? 😮😮😮🤩🤩🤩 Animation Vs The Internet???!!!
nerds in a fight be like:
wtf i just watched?! :D
I didn't think math would be my least favorite subject, but Alan changed everything
next video will be about programming?
Pov:- math teacher 💀
I love this and i give a BIG like!❤❤❤
Math turning into the best TV Show in the world? I would watch that. It seems like Alan made a first episode Maybe 🤔
Beautiful ❤
Math lore
I’m a visual learner and this helped me more than 14 years of school ever did
the fact that the stickman made a perfect circle…
Wow
I need a fanfic/story with this kind of power.
Make an "Animation vs Code" video please 🥰
My team is orange stickman
Superb
this video answer to: WHY MATH İS SCARY?
Learn at school ❌ Learn from tiktok and youtube✅
Genius
Insanity bro make pt 2 please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please
BRUH DID THE HOLE MATH EXACUATION HES NOT FAILING TODAY🫨
It's so awesome!

absolutly amazing
Amazing As Always
I'm very bad so yeah some stuff just make me go    WTF!!             I think so i just hqve bad memory maybe or maybe i'm just lazy
I love class math
You guys visualized math in such an interesting way that I haven't seen much before in other media, its truly amazing! Every time I saw TSC discover a new mathematical systems I excitedly wondered, "how is he gonna use this in a fight?". You guys have amazing creative minds and I can't wait to see more!
Holy Crap 7,9M View in 3 Day
Xem xong t bị mất gốc toán =)
Omg  i
I'm half into this and I am already with my mind blown. the closest I have to compare my mind blowing ness is watching a maxxor video. this is dense!
13:46  That giant alpha Null in the background actually scared me
They are getting too smart
if this was a game, it’d be my favorite like wow though this video was amazing
Khan academy hit different
Mano , teu trabalho é bom de mais , cara , quanto tempo tu ficou fazendo esse video , cara , ta tudo muito bem feito e tudo pode ser explicado , ficou bom de mais
that giant thing was actually aleph null if you look closely
The movement like a final boss 10:04😂😂
Right before math exam I saw this..... IM SOO MOTIVATEDD NOWEE
How I use calculator=
e^iπ x i = door?
oh wonderful! ! I am a Japanese high school student. I'm not good at English, so I can't speak it well, but I just want to say, "This animation is really a wonderfully creative and moving story."
Man idk how you made math atcualy cool like wth
I NEED MORE OF THIS THIS IS THE MOST CREATIVE THING EVER
at 11:38 imaginary numbers are falling from the cracks
A stick figure master maths in 14 mins and it took me 12 years to barely make it 😑
I would've been much more into math if I was able to see such smooth movement like this while calculating
Lol e^iπ makes out ie^iπ potal
POV: When the speedrunner fights the final boss VS when the speedrunner fights the twist secret boss who wasn't the real villain.
♡
I like the noise that e^iπ makes in 10:08.
This Animation taught me better Math than my Match Teachers ever did.
I must add it to my game
This makes alan and orange and his team prove that their smart
初めて数学を習ってきてよかったと思えた… このアニメーションは最高です。
It looks and sounds great. Really, its very difficult to come up with such an epic story from... Math.
You should make animation vs animation 6
Power of math
А в каком приложении ты делаешь анимации скажи пожалуйста 🙏
Orange is the smartest person in math.😂🤣
Love this,its such a great way to make the math more dynamic.
Orange amazing.!(action)
2why
it'w awesome
Это просто ахуено
Oh my god its the best transition ive ever seen!!
Dear Alan Becker I really like if’s you can do a new animation video call animation vs NATURE SCIENCE story: the chosen one return has traveled back to time in the Jurassic age, the chosen one return try to survive with the dinosaurs to get back home on Alan PC is creator at the end he will meet a strange characters name (doctor who) and help the stickman to get back home with is Time Machine the end ? If’s you like my ideas add a like on my comment
It's just the most amazing 😍
Very nice
e^iπ,ζ,δ,φ,the+end=the end
Alan Becker should be known as the next Albert Einsteim
I wanted to show this to my maths teacher
"Who knew math was so powerful?"  - my 7 year old.
please makes "animation vs. programmation"
POV:Asians when they get 5 years old
Twelve=4×3 or 3×4 4+4+4=12 3+3+3+3=12 4+3= 7+5= 12 3+4+5=12 4+4+3+1=12 3+3+3+1+1+1=12 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=12 10+2=12  1×10+2=12 10×1+2=12
i love at the end aleph null is big because its a infinity but the first smallest infinity. fun fact: aleph null is so big, its considered a infinity, but its the first smallest infinity, its so small compared to the other infinities that you can count to it, but it will take billions lifetimes to do so. 13:47
this has a good soundtrack
I can't be more grateful for this video's existance and just can't comprehend the creativity and ability of Alan Becker. Phenomenal job, I just can't put it to words. I'm not really good at math but I've always knew they were amazing in their own way, and that there is the "cool" in it and all that, when learning about my passions like philospohy, theology, psychology, symbolism etc. math gets mentioned eventually, so I knew there was something, but I never had the nerve or the will to genuenely explore it. I've alwasy wanted a cool and nice and also great anime/animation/story where math is the core of it, used in ingenious ways unumaginable, that's why I love this video. It is not a documentary... it is a stickman fighting using math. Perfection.  I don't know about 60% of all of the math used in the video but I can see there's something.  Great job Alan Becker, continue to amaze us.  Also, since I'm a storyteller and a worldbuilder who wants to spice his works with real/realistic elements of our world, like in this case math, this gave me quite a bit of inspiration.
As 11 Grader,This Gives Me A lot Of Fire to Learn about math Thx for doing this!
OF MY CALCULATOR OF EVRY VID WE GET THE VID GETS
Wow amazing please  make more mathematical videos like this.
10:39 yo i need that sound effect where do i get that
1+1=2😅
One stickman?
a
🤓
One of the most creative animations ive ever seen. I wish math was this fun in real life! 😂
Funny that all this began with a curcle
the war of the e thingy fight with orange it's soo coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
This the type if shi i be on during math class
Eulers number turning into sigmas to make them flying machines while shooting numbers part of an infinite series is just so cool, this entire video is just a love letter to maths
A teacher in a math lesson when you turned away
EL PODER DE LAS MATEMÁTICAS!!!!!!!

Never thought matgs could be thus interesting
This is top learning
this video make math not abstract
This Is The MOST HARDEST Language I Can Learn...
Math:you need game? Me:yes  Math:
nice they used music similar to Intelligent Cube (IQ)
Nobody:Math is easy Also Math☠️

That’s the best animation that I’ve ever seen about math. Each references since the introduction of arithmetics to Complex analysis and certain numbers and math’s instruments as the Kronecker’s delta and Riemann’s number were fantastic! Congratulations!
Is it me or did I see aleph null
Next bahasa komputer
that s pretty good🎉🎉
Galaxy brain🤯
You found me
So creative
Alan! Can you do a Animation Vs Note?
He learnt simple multiplication.. **proud claps**
Just a suggestion but a video about science is cool (elements and compounds being fused to make something else )
This is what I want my university math classes to be, and I wouldn't even mind solving the amounts of math problems we receive as homework. Also, this must be the most creative piece of art I have seen in a very long time. And I am glad to see that in an age of AI art.
Pt.2?
This is what the teatcher said when we needed this in Our lives
Who could have known that math can be this beautiful 😻
Did Albert instin make this
I literally understand everything in this video.
This is what YouTube was meant for
Damn, this video is awesome and i didn't understand anything
This is basically why you shouldn’t mess with Euler’s formula
Don't mess around with the evil brother of -1.
10:33 that ain't math that a death star
Awesome
Why does the e equation keep running away
미쳤나봐 ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
My Brain:💀💀💀
Watching this just makes me learn more math
I confuse but it is so cool
A syntax error occurred. Please restart your calculator.
A freakin mathematics teacher needs to watch this!!
He made the lore confusing for Americans
When you have a math degree but you become a animator
Bro taught math faster than my math teacher, that orange guy is definity IQ 810.  Edit: I realized math is so difficult in 10:02 . I'm still 5 graded, I have no idea about "cos, sin, tan, π, i , e" and "Σ" and never thought that "e" could scream.
If you made somthing like this again and maybe another subject
pov: TSC's mind in that jail cell from the last episode:
John wick chapter 5 : animation
yep this will definitely be used in our education systems as future kids will say.... thanks -_-  but you surpass yourselves with each video it is unbelievable <---- and I mean that in its literal sense
Chemistry came❤
The verse of alan or verse animation  The king no pupple the king is 😞 the chosen two
是久违的更新吗？！😻
I love how eulers number at the beginning times itself by i to make it imaginary again
the sound design was amazing
Epic math lesson 😂😂
can you do more of this animations
Waw brilliant!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
LA PUISSANCE DES MATHS A L'ETAT PURE 😍😍😍😍
This is not just an animation, it's educational for learning math and more. PERFECT.
This animation is truly a legend idc if u don,t pin me
If only they taught like this in school…
legendary
Insanoooo
X at the end 😂😂😂😂
数字という自然の偉大な力  素晴らしい演出だねこれ… 数学が好きな俺としては何度観ても飽きない最高の動画
100 = 100
When an esports player starts teaching math:
I wish our math teacher teach us math like this
This new teaching system would be great
I like math but my fav sabject is englesh
WOOOOW HOW YOU KAND  PLSFLOR FINIH IS 10 PLSPLSPLSPLLLLLS
THIS SHOULD BE IN NETFLIX BRO
That was AWESOME 👍💯💯💯😎😎😎😎😎😎💯💯😎💯😎
I think ℵ is parent.
Waww day 2 452like nice!
only maths students will understand the depth of creativity in this animation.
me : search on google who discovered math Google: it's orange u are a stupid u don't know who discovered math Me:I don't like math that's why 😁
What if orange puts the infinity to the circle gun instead of the dot💥💥💥
Bro has used a calculator to do this whole stuff🔥
Math is mathing😂😂
1+1= 2
🤯
I have been watching you since I was a kid... I got this in my recommendation rn
Put the alphabet in math
На 4:04 я перестал что либо понимать
Math is still my favorite
That's why math is my favourite version it always gives me Goosebumps and he went to another dimension
As a developer for a math learning app, I'm blown away by how math has been visualized here. I've been on a similar path with my project, Animath, which uses animations to explain algebra step by step. It's incredible to see the potential when you bring animation and learning together. If you're curious, I have more about it on my channel. Thanks for sharing this inspiring work, it's truly motivating for creators like me!
I love math
Wanted-Animator VS Animator Ep2?????????? 😮😮😮​
This is one of the COOLEST video i've seen on YouTube.
pretty good Sci-Fi x mathematical movie we got here
magnificent 😇😇😇😇😇😇
more
i= interworld=metamorphosis  This means you are sigma😂
I think teachers should watch this video in the class with students to make math fun to them lol
"see kids, this is why math can be fun"
Rush E,ruler's number
it's really so fking insane bro
I didn’t think math could hurt anymore than it already did
O
Math of Becker is most interesting and easier... =P 8:33 mi to wygląda na działko siniusoidalne 🤔
Amazing animation! I LOVE IT SO MUCH! This gorgeous art will definitely drive people to know about the stories behind math formulas
Если честно не понимаю я вашу матешу но это великолепно😊
"이 영상은 주현서가 좋아합니다"
ncreible
I don't understand ANYTHING in this video especially how the hell Alan managed to make even the most boring subject cool AF.
Im good at math
Bro learned the whole math in 14 minutes 💀💀💀💀
THIS, this is a Masterpiece! For guys that know the math behind it, its a beautiful storyline - absolutly love it, make a Part 2, 3 and 4 or make a whole series - cant get enough of this
so cool
למה יש א ענקית בסוף?
This was really interesting
1+1=2
Can u make more vids with reuben pls 🐷
Wow🎉🎉🎉
I was absolutely confused for some time at the end (I've never saw these kind of calculations etc.) but thats the most creative animation I've ever seen
Math lore
still can't found X
I feel smart just by watching this 😂😊
When the 20 is sus
9 year old me watching this:😶 wow didn't know math was op
Just amazing 👌
I learned all mathematics course in 14 minutes 🙂
Math help's The Orange one with the Chosen one down the line? :D
Albert Einstein belike
This is so cool!!!😮😍😍
1+1=1
bro that break my brain
Pembuktian bahawa matematik tak susah
I love how Aleph is portrayed as a god
have that kind of intelligence is amazing this has been the best  i have ever seen.Alan Becker might go over top!
10:01 the sound🤣🤣🤣🤣
You know 7,7 million views under 2 days says something abot the content’s quality
The fact that someone had to calculate all that
Somehow bro made math fun again.
-0.00+73704+3094=?
8+7+4+29=
Next is Animation vs Program😃
I have a suggestion  Make animation vs roblox (jus an idea)
muito bom
De nerds
how the heck does 1+1 turn into 0/r = π
Teacher: we will study this YT vid Students: *ugh this looks boring 14:02 mins later Student: teacher you never told us maths was so game like, who knew. let do this all week
א!!!
Emailing this to my math teachers
7:17 "i sin'
speaks volumes to how useless the public school system is when in 14 minutes a video without a single spoken word in it taught me more about math than the whole school system did in 15 years. This video was absolutely excellent 👌
Maths is amesing 🤔😱😰😳😲😵😫😧🤓🤒🤕😷😮😯🤗😜😝💞🕵️🖍️📓📕📝
Somehow orange makes math very fun
alan do a wanted animator vs animation ep 2 please 🙏
Ален Бекер художник от  бога .Я ценю твое творчество Ты мой любимый ютубер
This is flipping awesome.
Before I didn’t understand math — now after this still I didn’t understand math😂
hmm
здесь показана вся красота математики
I have no idea what is happening after addition and subtraction.
Me too I love math
알수없는 에니메이션 갑자기 나타난 애니매이션 vs  수학은 무엇인가요  마인크래프트 vs 애니매이션 에 나올상황에 나온 애니매이션 vs  수학은무엇인가 (오리지널)도없다
Amazing!!!
My brain just melted
Bro is literally a mathematician
Never enjoyed Mathematics this much before XD
one of the best animations you ever made!
bro this should be in theaters
i understand almost all of this but why my math grade is suck, sad
34Kth Commented 💙
Easyest way to learn math be like.
I have a theory about this. My theory is that after TSC was captured. The scientists put him in some sort of another dimension to test him or something. It's more of a prediction rather than a theory. My second theory is that:  Victim captured TCO to use him against Alan for revenge
?א
א?
Те кто шарят про математику сейчас сидят всё понимают и угарают, а мы этого ещё даже не проходили в школе!
Neeeeerd! (But great video I love it keep up the good work)
Want very much Physics version
I knew nothing about what he was doing 😭😭
8:41 doom Slayer time
0
Bro this Is so F = ma
THE GOAT
That looks like mathematician's fight in anime!
wow wow wow Rather, confirming that each video has a different creativity from the other 🔥
This is the best video I’ve watch on YouTube apart from mrbeast squid game🥵
Next: animation vs skibidi tollet
🤯🤯🤯
Alan knows math
What's Next? Algebra?
can someone make this a game
bro i am bad at math what is this
im suck at math so i dont understand this vid😅
Seriously insane💥🔥
You are mad. Nice
this is the most creative and fantastic and etertaining and shocking aimatio of all😭😭
When you think about it, Math is the most complex magic system in all of fiction.
I like to think that TSC discovered mathematics and rapidly learns the physics and logic behind everything relating to math and TSC is battling the final boss of mathematics.
interesting animation
11:24 Pov:Backroomsa Nasıl gidilir🤣🤣🤣🤣
This mathematics animation shows all of my life about math. Using math to weapon and fighting was impressing. Thank you for making interesting math animation with familiar character TSC!
Really shows how complicated math has become tbh
At this point make a game and I know it would be so good
I would love to see this in video game form.
Cool
Alan single handly probed that stickmans are smarter than s regular human being
Мега мозг
Это что то с чем то, ну ты мощный 👍👍👍👍
Congratulations on 22.5M Subscribers!
I forgot what life is after watching this
Alan what do you think of my animation?
Im understading my maths
I think you guys actually invented a whole new way to arouse interest for maths. I'm not joking.
RQ: Can you do "Animation vs Chemistry"
My maths teacher would be proud of you.
daumn daniel i think this is the smartest thing ive ever seen
This is beyond everyhing I've ever watched. It's like I'm watching the most epic Sci-Fi movie ever made. More than that. This needs so much creativity and understanding of this field to make... You guys always leave me speechless.
I hate Math 🤮😵‍💫
How
that's incredibly impressive the creativity in this video, math + art = epicity
10:01 my fav part because of the e^ipi saying “Waaa”
Mind blowing how it doesn’t make sense how in the world do you do this is beyond too far😮
10:28
What does א have to do with anything?
I'm gonna need a version of this with commentary to explain the expert stuff for us layfolk
The end just scare me a lot..
3 months later........             Science vs. Animation
How asian learn math :
Academic Math speedrun let's GOOOOO
even if i don't understand math i still can see what's going on here 😭🙏
TSC learned more math than me in my entire life
math war.
This is, by far, the best project ever made in this legendary channel
Everyone us talking about the animation but, the fact that orange made a perfect circle is just 💀
alan let his inner Asian out on this one
Amazing
I don't understand... 😭😭😭😭😭
There are 14 minutes and 2 seconds left before the exam. I:
The moral of the story is to never trust -1
I like the part when eiπ screams
East or west math is the best
Omg, sounds of math in this video are AWESOME, espesially i love sound of big circle gun
Surrounded by nothing but darkness and math, in the words a Patrick Star  "WHAT KIND OF PLACE IS THIS!"
how did we get from "1+1=2" to a frikin dark soul boss fight!?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please become my math teacher!
I love how TSC learns so quickly
Вы наверно не знаете что я сказал
Do Animation VS Alphabet
excellent bro
masterpiece
I watched this in my school
10:03  WAAAAAH!
Sooo the maths are right 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐
Youtube she's commented to you
Can you do part II or I wont sub to you
Animations vs Math? More like Math vs my brain
I'm not sure that it's how math works, but ok...
The Giant Aleph at the end is my favorite
my stupid ass brain not understanding 75% of this video
wish i studies maths
😝 Lol
One of a few videos that I love at first sight.
this is the peak of mathematics
thanks
I subscribed, congratulations
Bro this maths wanted to kill you
dis iz epic
very goods :))))))))))))))
wat is that big thing?
I bet all of what transpired is equal to 1.
Bro just animate all math lore
my brain shakes
This should get an award.
I like the detail about how Phi makes clinking sounds when it moves. 'Cuz it's the golden ratio.
😲 wow 👍 great I love mathematics 🤓🤓🤓more than very subject
U fight math with math
Из математики сделать шедевр...
Math if it was cool
Even baldi can't do that💀
This is more fun,  but i didn't understand this 😭😭😭💀💀💀
dunno but my fav part of the video is the tan beam part
Bro Made the death star
Even Maths can be so deep in meaning
this is how kids learn math now.
I can feel backbencherness from this comments😅😎
Alan backer you are G.O.A.T
Stickman vs that e equation ( I hate finding e in basic calculus)
learn with animation
But long time away I very love math
that was awesome how he created a huge death ray
Why has this video still not broken the internet?!
Worth my 10+ yrs of studies to understand this 14mins vid.
The two smartest kid had a different answer: 4:00
Do it ANIMATION VS MUSIC 🤣🤣🤣
SO. That's Math War due to a stickman figuring out about  √e(1+2) and other stuff, the E's have duplicated themselves and created.. E's VS 1 Smart asf stickman As not lasted very long, the stickman eventually helps the last remaining e and asked for some help to get out of there, and did it. Now E is back to being as lonely because there's no one to mathematic things for now anymore xd
No way did i just revise calculus by watching this
Math at school be like:
Better than marvel movies
I can’t tell you how it feels to see this as a math major, it’s fucking amazing
animation vs. meth <3
It reminded me of a math ghost that I used to read about when I was a child, I think it's a modern version of a math ghost.
At the 3 minute mark I didn’t know what was going on at that point
i didnt get any of it
best vid ever that I have watched
Lowkey why does this feel like a movie 🗿
100-2-98=?
Math lore
I don't have kids yet, don't even have a wife. But I'm gonna save this to show my kids how cool math is in 10 years.
Who would think math can be that exciting 😅😅😊😊
so 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘴 is how math was invented    (also the chosen one found the calculator app)
I always thought yellow is actually the smartest of all,I guess I'm wrong:0 And TSC's learning speed is faster than yellow's coding speed
LEGEND
Math's shouldn't math like that... Then again it is my worst subject 😂
epic -doglover69
Bro is teaching maths while doing a good video Lmao
><
POV: when you are answer the hardest question
I have no idea what just happened but it was epic...
100
E
very good very good
I'm really good at math and I love this animation so much
It all started with 1 haha
Speechless 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Good Animation bro👍
Math lore
Pls someone make this thing into a game
Einfach Schlüsselschwert
learned more in this 14min than in 12 years of School 😀
☺️☺️☺️☺️NOไ*******
School=X Alan Bercker=√
Math is a strong thing
absolutely breathtaking
You broke math!  Also, one of the coolest animation vs videos!
14 minutes of animation, I thought I was watching a movie
love the aleph-0 at the end
Pls make ANIMATION vs physics
I love how e^(i*pi) is pure evil, brilliant!
Mom: why are you watching Alan Becker and not math video Me:I'm watching math video and a Alan Becker video that's time consuming
Wow
ngl i have no idea wtf is going on but it’s the coolest sh*t i’ve ever seen 💀💀
I cannot stop watching this.
SHUIII!
What is e^iπ?
Số 0 không thể chia được cho tất cả các số Tôi đã thử 9÷0 kết quả lại là LỖI
bro just released the worlds best video about math
This was very good animated and very educational
Bro was good at marh
Man, if only math could be this fun...
My man must be good at math to do this
So begginingful!
I don't really understand this video/animation cause i'm still a teenager that play games and watch YouTube all the time,but still this is so amazing to put math in an animation with my favorite Animation,this animation is really cool like the other animation that Alan and his team made
Its gonna be hard...
Bro summarized my math journey 12 years at school into an 14 min animation🗿
اتقي ربك ولا تحط بفيديوهاتك موسيقى ولا تنشر افكار خاطئة
my brain is not braining but the fight is cool
This makes me more scared of math from now on.
1+1
Can anyone please explain me what is TSC ?  I'm confused 🙄
I knew it letters in math are evil
I'm a university student and we used All of the equations we seen, and it was so oooo mutch better that I understood them thank you for this video
6:48 ủa mình nhớ là sin là trục tung còn cos là trục hoành mà ta
Broo!  You are sooo much creative ❤
guess I'll never understand this stuff
1+1=2(😂😂😂😂😂)
Idea: animation vs little academy
Who made this must be a advanced calculus 🤓
数学の勉強がしたくなってきた
You know when my teachers told me I’d be applying all the math I learned outside of school aswell, I imagine this isn’t what they had in mind
When your parents want you to become an Engineer/Mathematician/Scientist but you love doing Animation :
Bộ phim hay nhất mà tôi từng xem 😮😮
7:34 sigma moment
Math professor of the century.
the best ill go is pie im a kid
BRO Who IS YOU SOUND ENGINEER. HE IS SOO GOOODDDDD
Алан ты просто гений,    У меня нет слов
You should put this in animator vs animation iv
This was made just so we could love math understand math and I really don't like math its too hard for me but I liked this animation
Lets apperciate Alan Becker for how he entertains us with Animation
i wish it was a baldi's basic animation
A typical student's dream before a math exam
If you ever feel that math is useless, just remember this genius became an animator
Level Asian: make math fun for everyone.
,,fv
mathematical respect 🤧
next video: Animation vs Physic
Ok but the way orange and exponential fought each other with math was satisfying af.
no way i learned something in this video
I love math now
If aliens see this video first. We are good.
Bro should become my maths teacher 💀
1+1 is 2
Everything sound very similar to Tron: Legacy
This is the coolest thing I have ever fucking seen.
I  suve I do not watch this type of animation I can't believe math is this type of interesting
Do a animator vs animation vi wanted episode 2
Bro just made math fun to watch
I barely know half of this, but it's still amazing!
I am fan
I didn't think I would ever like math
I Love your videos❤❤❤
He doesn't need oscar,but oscar need him,I hope it will be GOAT Animation📽️
the most genius perfect piece of art to ever exist
Animaton awesom ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊
terkoiz you nerd!
Math =  M = mental  a = attack t = to h = healthy  s = students
beautiful
i still can't beleive my eyes, felt like knowledge entered my mind in a flash
I wish ny math teachers taught me math like this
After watching everyone’s reactions to this god tier video, I’m surprised no one said that orange just made a giant math Death Star.
Didnt know Tsc Knew all of this
Bro made math into a war
2+2=5
Hi everyone I'm from Indonesia
Terrible video, all of the fun and interesting animations distract from the surprisingly informative mathematical principles on display. The story was way too genuine and emotional too, how am I supposed to learn if my eyes are filled with tears!
10:02  WEHHHHHHHHH
Amazing video ❤
my brain has exploded even from the basic math
1+1= o
Next up on Alan Becker:  Animation vs Chemistry Animation vs History Animation vs Band class (it will not survive)  Bonus: Animation vs Nursery Rhymes Animation vs Hydraulic Press Animation vs The cleanup song
Music name please
learn math with animation when you run out of ideas

Aint no way a stick man fighting the letter e taught me maths
I understood everything mathwise till 7:45 lel
this is so cool
Simply amazing 👊
THIS IS WHY I LOVE MATH
why no tetration 😔 jk beautifully animated as always lmao
Part 2 please
Tôi là ng VIETNAM nhưng t có thể biết bạn là  một hoạ sĩ rất giỏi . Tôi tưởng bạn chỉ giỏi về hoạ sĩ . Nhưng bạn đã làm chúng tôi có suy nghĩ khác về bạn😮
:-O👍
Can never mess with math bro 😭
sheesh
뭔가 개쩌는데  초반 5분을 제외하면 이해할 수 있는게 없었다
what about Animation vs science?
10:01 this scream killed me😂
Math is math...
Respect Alan's IQ 🧠 📈📈📈
This is Amazing
Laser gun
Gimme them balls gun
Wow math is so brutal
E turns into M then r
Bruh 2 days 7.4m view💀💀
Uh oh here comes a new series
I wonder where you will make one for friday night funkin
i am gonna mad after see this video.
ì love math
3
bro just made me fall in love with math somehow
If this was math id learn it
OMG math is my the Favoritest subject I like this!!!!
Aleph number in the background 💀
😮
amazing vid
Math is my least liked
If only math was this engaging back in my day…
Alphabet lore, but much better and more logical.
At first I thought he didn't use any of x and y symbol and that kind of stuff. Looking back closely, I realize he did use x only once, for Span({x1, ... xn}) = R^n. What a beauty of math combined with creativity in this video.
math
I love the א at the end
Nice video👍
Я никогда не думала что Математика может быть такой интересной и эпичной!
If only u made this earlier for my math exam...but i dont take math now
It so goooood math!!! ❤❤❤
Thanks alan Becker you my favorite youtuber  please come new part
Masterpiece!
This is absolutely stunning.
This right here? Is a unparalleled learning tool in my honest opinion. It physically shows concepts in a entertaining way. Bravo. Genuinely, bravo. Please consider doing other concepts for follow ups as this really will teach people concepts in ways they have never seen before. It makes things make SENSE.
Thx 4 the math lessons:)   Just bc I'm focus the math lessons👁👄👁
damn alan, You made it look so easy, I understand some of it now, thank you for this educational vid
I did not get any of questions i like that the math fights back math is hard
When they tell you that math won’t be useful in the real world. So you prove them wrong.
I don't know why but I got a lot of Portal 2 vibes from this video
Your team showed me a lot of math's art. Congratulation!
And that's how math was discovered .
= f (•)
Waiting until this becomes his most popular video
This just makes me wish that schools did a better job of teaching math. 9 months later (April 5th 2024) rewatching this and I'm getting giddy over -1 turning into e^iπ. I love math but I feel like the education I got made it more dreadful than enjoyable. Other than that, I absolutely love this video!
5:30 amazing circle 🤩
You tube approved
Bro why don't you start maths coaching
Watching this hurts my brain like WHAT OS THIS/
Imagine an fps shooter but you need to make them with math
ultimate dedication awesome and cool!
how about animation vs code
Man tomorrow i gonna attend one's of the biggest exam in my country and i'm really scare of maths 😢😢
Deep mathematics! And great action mathematical movie ❤
goofy ahh minecraft vid
Masterpiece
I fell like u guys , will soon be making/contribute in movies.
I'm just looking for a math error so I can look smart😅
cant belive my fav number got into the episode, e^(i*pi) :D
How about Animation vs Roblox
10:33 that's sound was crazy man
now 123456790 and ein
Expert guys
I'm hate math but i don't hate this one 😅
Don’t worry guys, they can only count to 64
0:28 it creates the emoji =3
Ai Vn Xin 1 tim
Wenever I do math I think about this 🤓
Bro thinks he’s tony stark
Me: "Oh its all over, it's the integral!"  Me 30 seconds later: "...He did what!?" 10/10
I ?!;
This. Whatever this is...this. more of this.
And this is what happens when you mix letters with numbers in math
.
My last 2 braincells in my exam belike💀
Highly recommend earphones.  How can Alan make an "e" so emotive??
TSC has the same amount of inventory space as a black hole
Ok
I actually learned something NGL
bro must take the nobel prize
this is beautiful
Imagine being able to visualize math and numbers like this… amazing
Well, this is probably the closest I'll ever see to a visualization of the inside of my head.
Bro created the dearth star
Literally me on the algebra 2 final exam:
Why this video feal so long
Please part 2
2:24 - 2:31 Bro, it looks like a Resident Evil puzzle with all the noises and i literally just played Resident Evil 2 and 3 again
More interesting than a movie ngl
This is amazing!!! 🤓
Anyone gonna talk about how TSC drew a perfect circle? 5:33
Alan you are an animation genius!
This might be the greatest thing I've ever seen.
never have i been so interested in math equations before
Literalmente hicieron que sintiera empatia con la formula de Euler y ese grito que hizo me parecio tierno jaja Ya me imagino el siguiente que sea Animation vs Quimics o Physics o Geography etc
huh
Me  during a math test: Teacher:i will show a very simple video Me:THIS IS NOT BASIC
Bro TSC was so clever that he reached the woodin cardinals and created a mathematical superspace governed by meta-mathematics and quantum foam-based geometry.
nvm math is more complex than I thought
students: solving questions other people: making sounds on desmos calculator alan:
I like math 😊❤
please part 2 pleasee pleasee
I like the bgm❤
When your teacher tells you to explain your work:
Definitely one of the best things  on Youtube
If i were in a world like this i would befriend e^πi
Como resolver este problema matemático en unos simples pasos.
なんもわからんけどおもろ
Love this, it’s such a great way to make the math more dynamic.
Now i understood why i love portal 2

11:19 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaa *crash*
mathematicians when your equation goes amuck
every "animation vs minecraft" skills  Tco : Flameburn (probably have many skills cus he is THE CHOSEN ONE)  Tsc : problem solver, math man, big brain stickman cus his head is big too (probably have more ability cus he is main character) Tdl : Red virus  red : animal general  green : god of sound (music and vocal)  yellow : builder, rod of command block user  blue : witch man  purple : king's knight (betrayed), vocalist  king : (nothing, his only power is stealed by yellow)  Alan : author
This one is crazy my brother i enjoyed it very much!! but i have a question, why did you use the letter 'aleph' (א) from the Hebrew language? I'm speaking Hebrew and I'm kinda surprised seeing it here tho :P Thank you for the great content, please keep going with the math episodes, that was wonderful!! <3
7.3 MILLION VIEWS AND THIS VIDEO WAS POSTED 2 DAYS AGO!!!!!!!!!1 SHEEEEEEEEEEESSHHHH I WISH I WAS YOU MAKING THAT MONEY!!!111 OMG!!!!!11
Bro in real life doing this will take years but it took orange 14 minutes
Asians: Ok, learn this by tomorrow, be prepared for exam  don't mean to be rude btw, just a joke
Did anyone else notice the giant aleph in the background at the end?!
Dont worry. I hate math too.
This went from a simple equation into a bullet hell into a FromSoft boss fight. Truly  an accurate representation to the difficulty of math.
I got lost when sin and cos first showed up ;-;
absolutely incredible
i love he tried to spell exit
Math
:)
pt2
Alan Becker is the 🐐!!
Damn
I started being truly amazed at iSin. Then the rest was just cool
Bro can make an e look happy and sad
this is what it looks like inside einstein's head while founding e = mc²
How the hell can someone make a whole war with math, AND WITH NO TALKING, also love the sounds
Did TSC just reinvented a Wave Motion Gun?!??!?!
1 +
Bro made comprehensive math fun
My brain:💥💥💥
Just saw a full analysis, it has my respect
Bro got them in 14mins and I got them in 12 yrs lol
my math is so fking bad but this is so cool
Orange is Nemton
finally i can say that for once, i payed attention to math
Peak level of entertainment
Damn that was intense I love your content and I'm subscribed by the way so continue doing these cool videos and epic fights
Visual effects top
This got me feeling dumb what the hell?
We should make math teachers let us watch this in our math classes
This is just brilliant. I wish I had had all of you as my math teachers in school!
Orange casually learning math  Me: *struggling on 6 + 9*
e^(iτ) would never do this to you.
This is the most interesting and beautiful release of animation vs something.
This guy just made math fun
this is soooo cool i love this
First Minecraft now math?
Huh. I didn't know Terkoiz was a math nerd!
No soy de ver un vídeo mas de una vez, pero es que Alan hace unas animaciones tan increíbles que me es difícil no volver a verla. ¡¡Gran trabajo!!
Didn't understand anything past division
i lke this animation, so confusing:D
Stickman in backrooms xd
These sound designs are off the chizzak!
The maths🥶🥶,Your a mad man😎
Yellow: Animation vs Redstone /  Mathematics Red: Animation vs Biology Blue: Animation vs Chemistry Green: Animation vs Music Orange: Animation vs English? maybe because he is the only character that can ig speak? out text.
This might be the most creative video I’ve seen from this channel in a LONG time.
I think now math if fun for me bc of the numbers and the animation so cool
Perfeito.   Perfect.
Man, I've heard of kinetic typography before, but this is ridiculous!
12:26 i just realised he was spelling exit damn thats smart
Hi, i thought Eluder (e i Pi) very kind .
1+1=2
Chale
is like albert einstein
Did man just figure out teleportation??? 😳😳🤯🤯
Y'all lost me probably at the 1/3 point 😂 As soon as sin and cos got brought out I knew I wasn't going to understand a lot after 😂😂😂
So this is why I learned math in school
Increíble son muchos caculos matematicos visto en la escuela a otro nivel
Bro taught me more math in this video than all my years of math
hey alan can you do animation vs henry stickmin
where's animation vs chemistry? :D
Stop making math look so damn cool man
Alan becher Makes animation animation against alfabet lore
Y is the music so intense (btw this is my 3rd comment THRID I have sooooo many questions)
this video has to be the most balanced mix of math and action
This is orange becoming a math wiz- as in a literal wizard of math
I’m thinking that orange is getting smarter and more smarter from math.
Lo chistoso es que si reconocí gran parte de las ecuaciones y formulas y hasta aprendí más xd. Excelente trabajo 10/10 ❤❤❤
I LOVE IT
It's really amazing bro
Could you do science version of this like they use table of elements and mor
good job🥰🥰🥰
Ха, я покажу это своей училке по математике.
Thhs is an amazing way to think about math!
Can tsc do my homework?
That was amazing!!!
This video, the concept, the execution, heck even the music, are so good and work so well together
The best animation ever❤ Love it.
so fantastic.
Hi like the way he interacts with the numbers
how the hell is he better at math then me this is an OUTRAGE!!!
OMG is good video
This is one of the best animation idea i have ever seen thx bro
Nerdiest animated math visuals I’ve ever seen.
Alan te superaste a ti Mismo  enserio que capitulo esta buenísimo
Bro actually made math look really cool
Never thought Math would be cool and fun to watch.
dang aleph is huge because its the smallest cardinal infinity  woldnt have know that the big thing is aleph if not for an explanation video
Me trying to escape math class belike:
this is cool
To the math nerd that did the equation and to the animator, heavily respected
Imagine if math is this fun  on a calculator or something
An interactive calculator like this would be sick.
Alan Becker❌ Alan Einstein ✅
HOW DOES THIS MAN MAKE MAN A CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE???
12:51 why i i think that a black hole
The sound is so good!
Orange is asian now huh❤
bro took the term "Knowledge is power", in this case is math, thts crazy man
10:04 why this part make me remember dark souls boss fights?
Это было просто прекрасно, нее . ШЕДРЕВРАЛЬНО 👏👏👏
i watched this before my calculus exam i hope i passed
Amazing
Bro made math entertaining
Simplemente epico, como hicieron las batallas, la música y a la ves ensañandonos matemáticas imagínate eso
the music and setting make me yern for another tron movie
I love maths, and i really like this
❤❤ I LOVE THIS OMG hate math tho lol
Oh no😖😓, this is what a civil war with mathematics feels like 😅😁
Is anyone gonna talk about how cute they walk/run?
Creo que ahora más o menos le entendí a la ley de senos

Never comment on videos but this is one of the best most creative videos I've seen😮
When did Orange became a math teacher?
This video  inspired me to go back at my older self as a math nerd
Мath lore
this is better then my math teacher
the second coming is getting to smart... hes becoming sentient about math he will become to strong!
oh no
the hardest battle of the stickmen
TSC almost killed an entire universe for no reason
10:40 bro smit the e blah blah blah guys
Let's all be honest if our teacher showed us this will probably pay attention more in math
This video is nothing less then what the original Animator vs Animation is. Perfect!
Sequel when?
The + end = over
와 점점 복잡해지는데 점점 아름다워지네
THis is your best one yet!
Les seré sincero no le entiendo
i am glad i saw this video and your channel :)
Thanks!
Maybe my comment is subjective.... But, I have to say that, *THIS IS BETTER THAN NUMBER LORE*
I've watched 30 seconds of the video and predict it'll end with dividing by zero
Wow it's just so incredible, recently I have gained interest in math again, and after this video I don't think I am ever going to lose interest in it. I don't even know some of the formulas and don't know even if it is correct or not but I don't care. I am going to learn more and more math as much as possible. I have been following you for 3/4 years, maybe when I started learning animation and you guys are just awesome, keep doing the great work....
This made me understand sin and cos I don't know how it just did. Thank you. I needed this
You know ( e ) stands for einstien because how dowa he know sooo much that i could go to diferrent dimemsion using mathematics and the only person who knows how to do that is albert einstien but he use it because the letter e particularly for the video because he makes e a character but in real life it means einstien
1+1=2
Even the music sounds like math!
@alanbecker how did you make this animation  Which application you used can u tell me
AWESOME
I know what would make my and your little animation's head break mix in so postfix or prefix math vs the standard infix.
Bro what happening in this video and the vidoe is fun
The big bro is back! I remember watching Animator vs Animation back in the good ol days
Man, this is awesome ❤️
So did orange know math before this or did they just pick it up?
5:58 uh is he opening the matrix
Bro math is already impossible
Now math classes should be like this
An episode would be interesting where in one of the portals a zombie apocalypse begins in a city and there are policemen fighting and becoming :D
brain not braining
I missed your vids alan becker!
POV me when my brain is try to figure out the math
Amo tus animaciones Alan me encanta como transmites la emoción de cada escena ❤
I have a question: what inspired you to make this, with math of all things? I have seen math animations, but hardly, if at all, for the sake for story telling (or maybe it's just me...). I just wanted to say great work!!!😄
My entire maths life from grade 1 to university flashed before my eyes.
This video is great but I am not at all smart enough to watch it
Imagine if your own animated stick figure would came here in this dimensional school. That’s crazy…
stickman rages warfare against eulers number using heavy mathmatical ordinance
Wow I love the music of the video, the animation better although I keep wondering what is the lore?
다음은 과학입니까..? 마지막의 장면이 예고편을 보는거같습니다
I just got my math teacher to watch this, let's say she was a big fan of it.
this is the best animation video from math i have ever seen
Just goes to show that I have a lot more to learn about math than I thought I would want to learn
For me alan becker is the best animator and no one can
I love math and this video was absolutely amazing👍🏻
More fun than math
He just created the most entertaining way to learn.
i have no idea what just happened but i still liked it cause it looked cool and i kinda understood it
bruh turned math into World War 3 lol
Ok 1+1=11 😁😁
Dfd😢😂😍🤩
1+1=11
Is there gonna be a part 2
Bro really watch whole math class video on youtube, good job 😂 👍
😊
This is probably the best thing I’ve seen wow
amazing + fabulous = Alan Becker
All of this complexity, only to alway return to a simple -1. 10/10
мужик это клево учитывая то что я не навижу математику и алгебру😅
Somebody has to make a game like that where people fight with numbers.
As a 6th grader who is studying math for my future career I can say I know 10 percent of this 😅😅😅
Is it just me or was everyone else so confused
🤯
13:40 is alpha really a ghost
هی پسر مغزم درد گرفت 🗿👍😅
Man learned math for his video #respect
(●)=
My brain in a super important math test : ( basically numbers fighting )
Math has never been more entertaining to me
And also wow! 22.5 mil! CONGRATULATIONS!!!🎉
this is insanely good wtF
The numbers mason, what do they mean?
Bro your animations are outstanding!!! Also battle scenes are creative and epic bro!
this is what second coming thinking in jail because of boredom
This is amazing! From the actual math to the plot to the combat, I love how far you've come as an animator!
creo que estos son los mejores efectos de sonido animaciones en la historia de la humanidad
when will the video animator vs animation acontinue
Second most educational Alan Becker video (redstone academy)
This is actually so cool
up next: Animation vs. Music (featuring Green)
My mind is dead by watching. This
Bro CODEING
This is how I wish math class could be like
Oque era aquele ser gigante no final
the e’s pov: GO MY ARMY ATTACK
If I was him I would do that to my school
How to get A+ on math  Another people : math course Me : Animation vs Math
This might honestly be the most creative animation ever conceived. And what an epic appearance by the Aleph Number at the end there.
me and the math book (i dont know math):
Queria ser inteligente pra entender tudo isso 😔
Jit tony stark
use calculus (NOT pre-calculus) to absolutely annihlate an e^i[pi]
Now i love math 😂
Hey, it's just a concept, but what if Alex Becker did something with the pibby glitch?
와 개쩐다 미쳤다 와~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
El profe esta explicando Y en mi mente:
can you do a godzilla vs animation?

me everytime doing math homework be like :
quien dijo que las matemáticas son aburridas??? Impresionante video, la verdad te quedo excelente, mis felicitaciones. Saludos desde Argentina...

😱😱😱😱🤯🤯🤯🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Bordel mais quelle génie c'est mecs , bravo les mecs vous êtes des champions ❤
Trying to do math homework be like:
Alternative title: StickMath The Movie
i know most of the math. e^i(pi) is -1 because some person proved e^i(pi)+1=0
a stick figure taught me math better than my math teachers ever could
I wish this was real life.
What happen you put three infinite
Absolutely astounding work
animation vs mtk
Where is his friends?
This is soo creative❤❤
New Quirk aquired: Math matics I CALL DIBS btw who else think this would have been the best power?🤩🤩😄🤔
Manoooo
How is my proof of Mathematics:
4:42 THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU
my man is back
thats something id like
We didn't get the answer what's 9+10
An explanation of the first part: 00:00 In the beginning 00:06 Number 1 is discovered 00:12 Concept of Equality 00:18 Concept of Addition 00:25 Adding 1: Counting, natural numbers ℕ, cardinality 00:35 Discovery of zero, positional numbering system in base 10 00:42 Decomposition of 2 as one plus one: 2 = (1 + 1) 00:47 Learning to count: Counting 2 by 2 00:53 Counting by 20s 00:58 A hundred (100) in the decimal positional numbering system 01:09 Discovering addition 01:11 Adding the elements to the left, 1 + 99 = 100 01:17 Adding the last one: 100 = 100 01:20 Subtracting 1 on both sides: 100 - 1 = 99 01:24 Subtracting another 1 on both sides 100 - 1 - 1 = 98 01:27 Find out how subtraction works 01:28 What if we subtract 98 from both sides: 100 - 1 - 1 - 1 - 98 = 0 01:32 What if we subtract one again? 100 - 1 - 1 - 98 -1 = -1 01:35 Discovering what's beyond zero 01:38 Euler's Identity appears: e^(iπ) = -1 01:40 Amazed, he tries to understand Euler's Identity. 01:42 But it is an unreachable concept, very "Complex" and unintelligible to this level of "reality". 01:44 Euler's Identity runs away, multiplies itself by i and disappears from the world of integers by rotating in the complex plane ℂ, which is where she "really" lives 01:51 Animation looks down, for that is where Euler's Identity escaped to by being multiplied by i: i*e^(iπ) = i*(-1) = -i. It is now in the complex plane at -i, but Animation can't get to where it is. 02:04 Continuing to work with the concept of -1. 02:12 Discovering negative numbers. Now we are the set of integers, at ℤ. 02:15 Sign laws, - . - = +, and distributive property of the sign. By multiplying both sides by the minus sign, we have: -1-1-1 = -3, -(-1-1-1) = -(-3), 1+1+1 = 3 02:23 Discovering multiplication, multiplication is a repeated addition. 02:25 Rewriting a 3 as a sum, 3=(1+1+1), so, 3x3 = 3x(1+1+1) 02:27 3x4 is also a repeated sum, 3x(something) is the sum of 3 times that something 02:28 Commutative property, 3x4 = 4x3, and on the left, the meaning of each of these two multiplications. 02:31 Discovering division: Before we had multiplication, 12=6x2, now we have division, 3=6/2 02:37 Just as multiplication is a repeated addition, division is a repeated subtraction, 6/2=3, that is, the 2 fits exactly 3 times in the 6. 6=2+2+2+2, subtracting (2+2+2) on both sides: 6-2-2-2-2 = 0 02:42 Another division, 6/3=2, that is, the 3 fits twice in the 6. 6=3+3, subtracting on both sides (3+3), we have: 6-3-3-3=0 02:45 6/1=6, and so we have all the divisors of 6, which are 1, 2, and 3. 02:47 So what if we divide 6 by 0, 1 fits 6 times in 6, 2 fits 3 times, 3 fits 2 times in 6, How many times does zero fit in 6, How many zeros do we have to subtract from 6 so that we have nothing left, infinity? Infinity is not a number. For reasons I won't explain here, division by zero, in mathematics, is undefined. 02:55 Dead end. We continue with other concepts 03:02 Powers. The square of a number is multiplying that number by itself. In this case, 6^2 = 6x6. 03:03 The square of a sum: (6+2)^2 = (7)^2 = 7x7 = (1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1)x(1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1), that is, a square of 7x7 units. 03:03 The square of a subtraction: (6-2)^2 = (4)^2 = 4x4 = (1+1+1+1+1)x(1+1+1+1+1+1), that is, a square of 4x4 units. 03:14 What happens if we increase the exponent number? 4^2 = 4x4 = 16, 4^3 = 4x4x4 = 64, 4^4 = 4x4x4x4x4 = 256, 4^5 = 4x4x4x4x4x4x4 = 1024. Increasing the exponent multiplies the base by itself as many times as the exponent indicates. And the result grows very fast 03:24 A number raised to zero gives 1 !!!, so 4^0 = 1 03:29 And raised to -1? What is in the numerator goes to the denominator and vice versa. In this case, 4^1 = 4, but 4^(-1) = 1/4 03:35 Rational exponents 03:37 The square root is the same as raising a number to an exponent of 1/2. They are two different notations for the same thing 03:42 Discovery of irrational numbers with √2. The Pythagoreans seem to have behaved very irrationally when they discovered it. 03:45 Square root of 1 is 1. 03:47 Square root of zero is zero. 03:49 And how much is square root of -1? √(-1) = i. And we enter the world of complex numbers with that curious i. 03:55 We can add the i's: i+i = 2i 03:59 And multiply them: ixi = -1 04:00 And if we multiply 3 times i, we have ixixi = ie^(iπ), that is, Euler's identity, the same one that escaped us at minute 01:44 by multiplying itself by i. We find it in the place where it had been hidden 04:09 Euler's Identity escapes, but it has nowhere to escape anymore. 04:10 And from here, things get very "complex".
Alphabet lore.. number lore... even both cant top.. MATH LORE
Wait a minute, I just realized something: that huge thing at the end was actually aleph nol, the smallest cardinal infinity.           If that’s how big the smallest infinity is, imagine how big omega would be…holy hell…😨
As someone who very quickly lost track of what most of the notation meant, all I can say is that I can FEEL how long this must have taken to make. Very impressive and fun to watch.  Sorry that I'm going to miss most of the detail of what's going on, but thanks for making something that took me back to the best parts of Stickpage animations. Very clean, very fun.
As a math nerd, This is ironically one of my favorite math videos of all time
Good
this was like a regular show episode
I do not understand math, but this............this is a masterpiece!!
I need this song.
What the math app do you use in the video
Yoo bro this so firee💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
wtf
what a masterpiece…
=2
Math is easy but if you look so long its hard
never thought id get emotional over some weird ass symbols 😭
1+1= window 🪟
Very good
So cool
WOW... IM speachless!
O
this would be a really cool video game, though. I want to create weapons of mass destruction with calculus
My brian: ☠️☠️☠️
I love how we still get to call it AvM
bro had beef with the most beautiful equation
not me actually learning a bit of math with this 😂
Literally me trying to use a calculator
This animation reminded me: stickman protévé tetris
Bro explained whole mankind history with a single video 💀
i still don’t understand math but i do got the idea that alan’s team are incredibly smart tho ❤️
5:40 nah man trigonometry slapping me back in the face
Matemáticas 😊😊😊
Alan went through eight years of school in under 15 minutes.
Explicación de la primera parte:  00:00 En el principio 00:06 Se descubre el Número 1 00:12 Concepto de Igualdad 00:18 Concepto de Suma 00:25 Sumando 1: Contar, números naturales ℕ, cardinalidad 00:35 Descubrimiento del cero, sistema de numeración posicional en base 10 00:42 Descomposición de 2 como uno más uno: 2 = (1 + 1) 00:47 Aprendiendo a contar: Contando de 2 en 2 00:53 Contando de 20 en 20 00:58 Una centena (100) en el sistema decimal de numeración posicional 01:09 Descubriendo la suma 01:11 Sumando los elementos a la izquierda, queda 1 + 99 = 100 01:17 Sumando el último uno: 100 = 100 01:20 Restando 1 a ambos lados: 100 - 1 = 99 01:24 Restando otro 1 a ambos lados 100 - 1 - 1 = 98 01:27 Descubre cómo funciona la resta 01:28 ¿Qué pasa si restamos 98 a ambos lados?: 100 - 1 - 1 - 98 = 0 01:32 ¿Y si volvemos a restar uno? 100 - 1 - 1 - 98 -1 = -1 01:35 Descubriendo lo que hay más allá del cero 01:38 Aparece la Identidad de Euler: e^(iπ) = -1 01:40 Asombrado, trata de comprender a la Identidad de Euler 01:42 Pero es un concepto inalcanzable, muy "Complejo" e ininteligible para este nivel de "realidad" 01:44 La Identidad de Euler huye, se multiplica a sí misma por i y desaparece del mundo de los enteros al rotar en el plano complejo ℂ, que es donde ella "realmente" vive 01:51 Animación mira hacia abajo, pues es a donde escapó la Identidad de Euler al ser multiplicada por i: i*e^(iπ) = i*(-1) = -i. Ahora se encuentra en el plano complejo en -i, pero Animación no puede llegar a donde está ella 02:04 Siguiendo trabajando con el concepto de -1 02:12 Descubriendo los números negativos. Ahora estamos el conjunto de los enteros, en ℤ 02:15 Leyes de los signos, menos x menos da más, y propiedad distributiva del signo. Al multiplicar a ambos lados por el signo menos, tenemos: -1-1-1 = -3, -(-1-1-1) = -(-3), 1+1+1 = 3 02:23 Descubriendo la multiplicación, la multiplicación es una suma repetida 02:25 Reescribiendo un 3 como una suma, 3=(1+1+1), así, 3x3 = 3x(1+1+1) 02:27 3x4 También es una suma repetida, 3x(algo) es la suma de 3 veces ese algo 02:28 Propiedad conmutativa, 3x4 = 4x3, y a la izquierda, el significado de cada una de estas dos multiplicaciones 02:31 Descubriendo la división: Antes teníamos la multiplicación, 12=6x2, ahora tenemos la división, 3=6/2 02:37 Al igual que la multiplicación es una suma repetida, la división es una resta repetida, 6/2=3, es decir, el 2 cabe exactamente 3 veces en el 6. 6=2+2+2, restando (2+2+2) en ambos lados: 6-2-2-2 = 0 02:42 Otra división, 6/3=2, es decir, el 3 cabe dos veces en el 6. 6=3+3, restando en ambos lados (3+3), tenemos: 6-3-3=0 02:45 6/1=6, y así tenemos todos los divisores del 6, que son 1, 2 y 3 02:47 ¿Y qué pasa si dividimos a 6 entre 0?, El 1 cabe 6 veces en el 6, el 2 cabe 3 veces, el 3 cabe 2 veces en el 6, ¿Cuántas veces cabe el cero en el 6?, ¿Cuántos ceros tenemos que restarle al 6 para que no nos quede nada?, ¿infinitos? Infinito no es un número. Por razones que no explico aquí, la división por cero, en matemáticas, está indefinida 02:55 Callejón sin salida. Seguimos con otros conceptos 03:02 Potencias. El cuadrado de un número es multiplicar ese número por sí mismo. En este caso 6^2 = 6x6 03:03 El cuadrado de una suma: (6+2)^2 = (7)^2 = 7x7 = (1+1+1+1+1+1+1)x(1+1+1+1+1+1+1), es decir, un cuadrado de 7x7 unidades 03:03 El cuadrado de una resta: (6-2)^2 = (4)^2 = 4x4 = (1+1+1+1)x(1+1+1+1), es decir, un cuadrado de 4x4 unidades 03:14 ¿Qué pasa si aumentamos el número del exponente? 4^2 = 4x4 = 16, 4^3 = 4x4x4 = 64, 4^4 = 4x4x4x4 = 256, 4^5 = 4x4x4x4x4 = 1024. Al aumentar el exponente se multiplica la base por sí misma tantas veces como indica el exponente. Y el resultado crece muy rápido 03:24 Un número elevado a cero da 1 !!!, así, 4^0 = 1 03:29 ¿Y elevado a -1? Lo que está en el numerador pasa para el denominador y viceversa. En este caso, 4^1 = 4, pero 4^(-1) = 1/4 03:35 Exponentes racionales 03:37 La raíz cuadrada es lo mismo que elevar un número a un exponente de 1/2. Son dos notaciones diferentes para lo mismo 03:42 Descubrimiento de los números irracionales con √2. Los pitagóricos parece que se comportaron muy irracionalmente cuando lo descubrieron. 03:45 Raíz cuadrada de 1 es 1 03:47 Raíz cuadrada de cero es cero 03:49 ¿Y cuánto es raíz cuadrada de -1? √(-1) = i. Y entramos al mundo de los números complejos con esa curiosa i 03:55 Podemos sumar las i: i+i = 2i 03:59 Y multiplicarlas: ixi = -1 04:00 Y si multiplicamos 3 veces i, tenemos ixixi = ie^(iπ), es decir, la identidad de Euler, la misma que se nos escapó en el minuto 01:44 al multiplicarse a sí misma por i. La encontramos en el lugar donde se había escondido 04:09 La Identidad de Euler huye, pero ya no tiene donde escaparse 04:10 Y a partir de aquí, las cosas se vuelven muy "complejas".
Bruh Alan can do animations vs anything and make it look epic
i wonder if math teacher show this to there students
Now I want to see mathematicians YouTubers react to this, it's so good!
This looks so cool! To bad I understand NONE of it!
You forgot these math symbols:% < >
brutal!!! 🧐🤘
3:18 lasted knowing damath but after that I'm just watching it.
No entendi ni pija xd
re drogado
Cine-math-ographic !
I have no clue what i watched but i love it anyways
7.1 MILLION VIEWS WOW!!! CONGRATS ALAN!!
What we learned: math is boring but making up something with math is magic
Это лучший мульт, который я видел в своей жизни! Спасибо огромное!. So far, this is the best action movie in 2023!.
how come my maths teachers can never make math class interesting but when alan posts a video called "Animation vs. Math" im suddenly intrigued?
this is how I feel about math
I cant believe we end not seeing the potential of Aleph!!
The fact that he makes my favorite subject with one of my favorite things is impeccable.
Is this cannon
2:50 And here, orange stared in the face of true infinity in its purest, rawest form, and said “no.”
thanks for the help with my homework :)
I love the creativity and effort put on the animation! Imagine doing an animation smooth like this and make the calculus actually being accurate!
Dope
What is the name of the soundtrack?
🧠☁☁🔥🔥🔥
everything i learned in 9 years, is in one video.
How could he understand that math so quickly by just understanding himself, I just don't understand that math in this video 😅😂
this is absolute genious, this is a video that evolves over time for the viewer as the more you learn the easier it is to understand whats happening
For some reasons I seem to understand these
I like it
As a frequent Numberphile viewer, this is a very satisfying video to watch
That is so so amazing
Ahem, what
And that's basic math 👍
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
That animation of e running was mega cute
A Matemática é simplesmente linda!!! ♥️

Bro figured out how to do the equation to life
This is amazing
math is verry, VERY awesome
I'm glad that i can at least comprehend half of the math equation. Never thought I'd be happy with my math comprehension in my senior high school year.
Bro got 7.1 million views in 2 days💀
Finally not minecraft
Man casually flexed in a twelve minutes video knowledge of which I should have amounted in twenty years of my life
Alan:Learn. Math.
Awesome
This should be a game!!!! Imagine if everyone had their own numbur that they could mess with and could interact!
Alan Becker please do animation versus sports
Beautiful representation of mathematical concepts.
aprendí más que en la escuela
That bih so hard 🏆🔥🙏🏽Swear to gawd

This video + phonk music = perfection
Knew that maths were evil
YOU LITERALLY CRUSH THE UNIVERSE WITH MATHS
Why does this make me like math and makes math fun?
Does The Second Coming Know 2+2?
Wait is the name your app animation ?
Now that is what I call math that was so amazing
日本でもみれるなぁ
What is the background music that’s in most of the video?
His team should do one on music
😮😮😮😮😮 MUUUY BUEENO!!! 💪🏽😎🤙🏽🤯🤯🤯🙌🏽🙌🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 QUE GENIALIDAD, ASOMBROSO!
I feel the need to mathematically watch this forever.
well that was an awesome video
I have no idea what any of the maths were byt nice
Omggggggg
I hate and love how you brought in Uniform Circular Motion to bring out Simple Harmonic motion. Has to he my favorite concept used in the video. Thanks Alan!
Video starting with 1+1 and went to start an war
If math was an anime
We now know that orange is approximately 2.75 in length
I don't understand any of it but I like it
13:38 Aleph... is represented by a piece of the Complex Plane that forms the symbol of the same name in Mathematical Sans Serif. The top and bottom of it becomes much more opaque. Aleph is very large compared to the other symbols, as it represents an infinite set rather than a constant. They come at the end of the episode to comfort and possibly befriend Euler's Identity and walk away/bounce away.
i cried when he did exponents 😂
Me playing DND: I choose mathematician as my class DM: Okay but you can’t really do anything Me: Oh really?
cirno would lose to math, definitely
When math teacher watch this:
Make video s quicker
As a person who majored into math, this is the most interesting video by far
The math turn to a giant ass Yeager from pacific rim and then orange makes a death star what is going on
learnt more than my entire math district combined.
ya estoy listo para el ejercicio
رياضيات أكثر من اللازم، أعتقد أن عقلي لن يستحمل كل هذا.
I do wish we got more math topics such as triangle based math
Orange changing the numbers is some tony stark type hologram stuff
They didn't teach math like this!
8:25 isn't sin(π)/cos(π) iqual to 0 ?
I loooove the sound design!
Joder esto es cine!

I swear to god, every Chinese people is stressing their brains out too!( to be clear many Chinese schools really focus on math, so they understand over half of the things but they are still stressing with this video when they watch this video on bilibili )
1+1=2
Your final exam wont be so hard. Exam:
I saw this number in the end: ℵ
You did it Alan. You finally made me not undertand anything on this video😅
only if i didnt watch this now, now i gotta watch it again during school
Almost didn't understand 7:36, glad I remembered my Taylor series made it to 13:05, know what the gamma function is, but don't know what the sum represents. My guess is something to do with higher dimensional spheres (did understand the functions after that tho)
I learned more in this video than in my classes xd

Bro wanted to give us a lesson 💀
i would ove never expected the fight's lol
This man Alan needs a ANIME or a show or something. This is wicked.
this is better than every action movie that come out lately
the best ep i ever see in my live
Fireeee, send this to your math teacher or professor lol
Animation vs Minecraft: Wither Storm?
Can someone explain the mathematical concepts in this video to me, I would love to learn.
victim's mercs:what the hell are you the integral numbers dealing with infinites and the mathematical equivalent of the death star beam that the TSC built:death
This deserves an Oscar for real!!!!!!!!!
THE LEGEND OF MATH
I am in AWE! Absolute awe at how accurate, entertaining and knowledgeable this is! You don’t just learn this in one sitting, some of this goes beyond college teachings. Fantastic work as always :))
Cool ❤❤❤
it's so Amazing!! i'll wait for the next part from this video
8:29 math gun now?
1+1 2
I am proud to say I learned nothing but it was fun 😂
Thanks for teaching me
This was really cool.  Can we get more animations like this?
this reminds us that alan had something in mind for a new series while on his math test and told his lead animator about it.
E is g
Why is -1 the villain
I barely understood most of that but the animation never ceases to impress me
Homeschool math is exactly like this, our home is mostly charred remains.
Animators: How good do you want this to be? Alan: 01011001 01100101 01110011
A masterpiece bro im baffled at this DAYUM
Math is hell  a of a drug
Ждём 2 часть
Blockbuster ❤
Even though I only understood up to the square root part, this was still very entertaining and well done, it honestly makes me want to learn more math; it seems so interesting!
This is by far my favorite animation you've made.
nice!
My dear
This is crazy good
my head on math test:
8:15
א
alt title "Math Lore"
Next year I want to try and ask my teacher to show this in my class, I'll update yall if it happens.  I DID IT, I SENT THE EMAIL TO MY TEACHER, all I got to do now is wait
What was that giant thing in the background at the end
Nunca pensé que la matemáticas fueran tan entretenida
Animation vs Physics :(
Uffff amazing
wow, I mean I hate math, but this is art
4:45 this fight reminds me of Kingdom Hearts:Chain Of Memories, Amazing animation dude
Awesome way to teach math.  Now I have a desire to get back into math, 😂.
I have learned more math from this fourteen minute YouTube video than I have in the 14 years I was in school
THIS IS FLIPPING AWESOME
Can you and your team make a stickmen in sonic the hedgehog animation?
11:05 Orage really said: "ENUMA EILISH"
13:37 my headcanon is that delta is dirac's delta, which has really cool properties :)
What a clever way to show the beauty of math :D
❤❤❤
Someone has to recognize the aleph at the last part
that was next level amazing!!
I dont need to go to math school anymore
bro just tought me more than school
If math was this great in class, I swear I wouldn't hate it so much.
My Brain During the whole math exam be like:
Broken mafs
💀☠️💀
I would dare elon musk to make math like this in EVEY SCHOOL
As a student with autism, I did math between elementary and high schools, I love how SC meets Euler's Identity at that point. Good work, Alan.
As an engineer this has got to be the coolest animation I've ever seen. Its so fun to watch and 100% acurate all the time
Las matemáticas es una materia que me acompaño toda mi vida y es una obra de arte, abrir la mente algo mas alla que solo simples números 🤓💫
Woowowowowow
I Enjoy This
Damn educational and cool SOHCAHTOA
hola alan soy gran fan tuyo cuando subiras mas videos
The lnfinite Math User: € Lord:  HP 3000k
1+1=?🧍
Are you surprised if I tell that I didn't understand anything?😂
i like how aleph is huge because he is the biggest number in the entirety of math
Понятно, Алан проходит очень важную тему в ВУЗе))))
Just do the 1 divided by 0 and everything dies because it makes a black hole as you cannot Divide anything by 0
Bro went from iq 1 to1000
matchs fav subject how to be THIS IS FRICKIN AWSOME
I expected this video to have entertaining value exclusively, but bro, you just explained what radians are better than any teacher I've ever met
We need u in schools😮
Neat
im trippin BALLS..
How do he get in to the MATH ZONE
I failed at Span (not a native english speaker, might be something I know?).
Give the second coming coffee and see what happens
I knew more of that than is healthy
What he disappeared in the end was he tricked?
bro who knows what any of this math even means
Cool
Orange: guys i had this crazy dream
this can teach you math faster then a school.
Now all thats left to do is Animation VS Every School Subject
This is probably the best math refresher ever made.
you help me a lote thank you
why have school teach math for multiple years if this 14 minute video exists?
Netflix chora por causa dessa animação
2 days 2M views is insane
You can't win a rational argument against an irrational number You can only co-sign it 😉
Damn! This video is a masterpiece! I'm very bad at math but now I can imagine how it lead to the space and time~
This is a fever dream.
Tuve que verlo con mi mamá para entender
Elementary to high school explained in 14 mins
This is probably one of the most genius pieces of art ever created.
When I first learned about imaginary numbers, I too understood that the fabric of reality was only one dimensional.
start 1=1
Never knew Euler's relation was a d head lol
Требую  продолжение.
Trop nul trolong
I did not understand half of this, but I still enjoyed it.
Thanks to school, I knew _just_ enough to barely comprehend this masterpiece.
the second chosen should be a math teacher
he turned into the 5th grade math teacher giving a *"simple"* test
Это лучший мульт, который я видел в своей жизни!😍 Спасибо огромное!❤
My head gonna explosed😵‍💫
2
Ayua no entiendo nada ;(
1+1=141
This is the only time I’ve actually enjoyed seeing math lol
Calculator lore is VERY expensive, damn
bro tought us more in 15 minutes then 15 years in school💀💀💀💀💯💯💯💯
א what a beautiful end
Урок математики, который мы заслужили
I do not understand anything, but I love it!
1+1= 💔
Oh dude your math so good
Alen
Props to you allen
Math: the anime
The sound fxs on this alone, make it one of the best animations yet
i dont have to look to know there are a few comments that will say "who knew math is cool". Always has been
oh thanks i always wondered what math sounded like
The math references are so well made
This is your best video to date! I couldn't keep up with all the concepts. This needs a YouTube maths communicator to go through all the concepts :D
this is very much how learned math in high school. desmos is really fun.
Amazing but heh?
Wee NEED part 2!!!
Bro has shown the beauty and hatred of math through the most artistic and satisfying animation video. It was truly amazing, and the hard work dedicated to this was worth it in my eyes. Amazing piece of work.
Magnificent mathematical visualization😍
رياضيات جمعها بلانميشن طلع شي اكثر من رائع
10:02 - 10:03 was the best sound effect ever
why didn't I learn maths like this
If bro can use these equations to create a portal or smth irl, I would like to be the tester to see if I am taken to the quantum abbyss
The average math final
My brain isn't braining
Nunca me aburrirán las animaciones de Alan Becker, sus animaciones son legendarias y muy buenas
CHILLS
If math was like this I would be doing math daily
Many problems would be solved if TSC had taken a "x0" out of there
Wooooooooow ¿Quién diría que las matemáticas no sirven para atacar? Es decir eso estuvo epico ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
can you please make "animation vs programming" or "animation vs data science" or "animation vs linux" it is the best animation as a ml engineer THX man 10/10
ok, my brain gona die. I'm stupid
Wow just wow this is amazing wonder what animation vs English would be like
Pov: You missed one day of school...
These are nostalgic
Надо бы тебе побольше делать анимаций про математику
At the end if the video u can see a giant sign walking that called "alef" this sign is actually the first letter on hebrew
1+1=2
the sound effect is so satisfying
Orange is much smarter now😅
That made my brain hurt oh lord
Vay beee
If my teacher showed tgis vid i would flip
A LITERAL STICK FIGURE is now smarter than me😭
Wow
I love it <3
The first few additions/subtractions: „yeah, I can keep up, I know some math :)“ e^i*pi appears: „i know nothing about math“
This video is going to laughs to me and i feel good to watching this video So thank your
Alan's team really just made an animation for all the mathematicians out there
Just Casual explaning better than half of my schools Mathe teachers
Does anyone remember king orange's past well I think we should get a good ending😢
Does anybody understand this or am I just dumb
For a stick figure, this guy learn how to use math effectively really fast! Years and years' worth of math stuffed into a 15-minute video!
I'm Brazilian and I really love your videos
Basically learning math until the math test and learning everything.
Gonna need a numberphile video for this one
I would have given more than one like if I could!
My brain during the math finals
Man i love meth
The math is, infinite.
Próximo vídeo: Animation vs. Química
انا لو ذاكرت الفيديو ده هقفل رياضة في الثانوية العامة
What is the next, Chemistry?
Plzzzz next animation 😢
yo i love ur content u deserve this and more but i live in a country that is poor so i cant donate much.
You lost me when he started subtracting
this gave me a headache
Are we going to ignore the fact that the second coming made a bloody Death Star 😮😮😮
Wow he has big brain to doall that math
Huh
HOW THE HELL IS ANIMATED MATH MORE UNDERSTANDABLE THAN NORMAL MATH
This is how you make math fun
Ni lo que me enseña en la escuela
This made math fun
This is mind blowing
If math lessons were like this, math would for sure be everyone’s favorite subject
Hope kids in the future don't have to waste hundreds of hours and years instead of a few hours learning like the "animation" here
The + End = ?
Not drawn to scale ;)  In all honesty, this is AMAZING! Well don to everyone who worked on this!
My 12 years old stupid ahh Trina figure out how this math works
I love this, but it goes too fast to process. A slower pacing would have made it easier to follow.
If math was portrayed in schools like this maybe kids would wanna go lmao
Its not Magic, its match
You just made math way more intresting really , already loved maths it's just now you increst it ✨️ thx
Imagine if you could fight irl like this! 🤯  Please make a series of ‘the Alphabet vs the Numbers + Animation’!!! 🙏🙏🙏
I don’t even understand half of what’s going on but it’s amazing
that was my whole comp sci degree animated.
This should be a school required video
Everyone's saying that this is cool and math would be their fav if it was taught this way but how is this cool math was literally trying to end orange's life 😢
Video would be perfect for almost any age from elementary to college level. Both educational and enjoyable to watch.
Awesome
More!! Part 2
ai cabron
Firstly: This looks like a Second Coming backstory.  Secondly: This is a sick as heck calculator tralier.
4:51 is so cool
I never thought math could be so fun, and how the freak did they make a combat scene in a math animation
My brain in math exams
Your principles of animation series has been shown to me in animation classes countless times.  Cant wait for this to be shown in math classes in schools everywhere
1+1=2 owesome video alan becker
Is it bad if I was kind of understanding more of that than I should?
that was intens
Make a video like this based on physics concepts
Do animation for vs sonic the hedgehog next
never thought seeing a running e would be damn funny
Stopped understanding after 4:00
This channel is the best I've seen in a long time
Как он попал в солёную математики ? 🤔
ABİ NOOOOOOOOOOLUR OYUN YAP NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLUR ABİ
The start:😀👍              1:32  The middle:⚔️⚔️.         8:41 The end:😢😃                11:49  Thats what makes the videos always so wholesome, especially the minecraft series
I love you videos they're so smooth The really cool I like the Minecraft ones too
This was better than some action movies.
будем ждать такое же видео только теперь со скриптами
math lore
Epic math
Codes are math and animations are coded, so its actualy math vs math! 😄
Dude has gained the power of mathematics
just saw the title and was like "LOL i need to watch this!"  EDIT: just finished watching. HOW THE HELL DOES A FRIKING STICK MAN TURN MATH INTO A WEAPOND?!??!?!?!
Ok, now i love math.
i got some strong super paper mario vibes from that bossfight and i love it that's a really good concept here, props to the animation team
The fact this is just started by a 1
Жаль что в реальной  жизни так не преподают математику😢
Me when I take a math exam😂
this just made math a whole lot cooler
Я очень сильно удивлена что из математики с смогли сделать такое интересное видео!!!❤
I'm grateful for school for making me able to understand most if this video
Bro hit him with the 123 combo *LITERALLY*
From all Alan Becker Videos, this was obviously the most logical and 5headed. I smiled whenever I understood the math problem😂 I appreciate you guys for the effort you put in this!!!!
I love how the music makes it sound like orange is coming up with a new invention
İt's better than any math  videos
Please make star wars Vs ani
this guy literally fights agaisnt everybody just to befriend the enemy at the end, a true legend
PARTE 2 !!!!
God a sequel would be crazy. Imagine how complex the math would get
la vidéo est incroyable mais en tant que français et vivant dans un des pays les plus nul en math d'Europe cela va pas me faire apprécié les math pour autant.
It all started with numbers... and then they were all replaced by greek alphabet...
THAT WAS FU**IN INCREDIBLE .AMAZING JOB
Magnificient
10:02 "waaaaaahhh"
9:58 as x → infinity it turns into an integral so realistic
Is this for real?
Please do a English
integrals are used as weapons as bombs and every weapon
u just smasched my had with it but it was clean af
One day I will watch this video and understand it
This is a true love letter for Math enthusiasts.
Where animation vs tf2
this what happening in gman's dimension in between of hl2 and 3 (if it comes out)
Hands down, coolest video I have ever seen on YouTube
That was AMAZING! Super duper creative as well!
watched this three times before noticing he used e to spell out exit 12:28
cnat believe euler's numebr was so popular they made it real
It is very interesting
It's art.
7:34 calculus yay
7:11 phase change yay
6:50 if it is a unit circle it will make a perfect sine wave?
timestamps + explanations (nerdy kid edition)  0:13 - equality between 2 numbers 0:22 - succession/addition by 1 (1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3) 0:44 - 2 as a set of 2 items, 1 and another 1, actual addition (10 + 2 = 12, 20 + 35 = 55) 1:10 - abstraction of numbers to make a smaller... uhhhh... equation? idk what does this do but maybe it just simplifies the equations i guess 1:23 - subtraction (2 - 1 = 1, 100 - 1 = 99) 1:34 - negative numbers (-1, aka 0 - 1) 1:40 - euler's identity, e^i(2n)π = -1 1:50 - (im just gonna call it e) e goes into the imaginary dimension by multiplying itself by i 2:15 - setting a negative number negative again just inverts it back to positive 2:23 - multiplication (3*3 = 9, 6*2 = 12) 2:35 - division (6/2 = 3, 12/3 = 4) 2:41 - division by 0, basically infinite amount of times 3:04 - exponentiation/squaring a number (6^2 = 36, 4^2 = 16) 3:30 - discovery of ANOTHER way to visualize division, god theres so many ways 3:40 - square roots (opposite of squaring a number, √4 = 2, √2 = 1.414....) 3:50 - discovery of i (√-1) 3:58 - i*i = i^2 = -1, i^3 = (-1)i or -i, getting imaginaried e out of the imaginary dimension 4:16 - function for e^i(x), pi makes the cos = -1 and isin = 0 making e (not eulers number, the identity) = -1 4:20 - the minus sign can make stuff negative, or inverted in other words. (basically turning tsc turn around/invert) 4:22 - ..... it doesnt work like that... i mean.. pi is part of a semicircle, but eulers identity is a function not a graph drawer... 4:32 - of course, because it works in games, it also works in math. reallyyy clever alan. 4:44 - because e uses a minus sign, and tsc uses a plus sign, and they both use 1's, they cancel out and become 0 which is a fun addition. 4:51 - here tsc makes a bow out of two 2's and a multiplicative sign, and once shot, outputs a 4, cause 2*2 is 4, which is a fun addition. 5:17 - imaginary plane + real plane (so just.. a.. plane..?) 5:33 - tsc draws a unit circle... in the imaginary plane. which is weird. and then discovers what a radian is. and then a radius. and even then, finds how to change the radius and finds theta. wow. 6:37 - pie. cause and seen us. (cos & sin) 6:49 - for some reason, alan's animation decided to put cos in the imaginary direction, but make it work with real numbers. then made tsc make sin into i*sin and sin goes through the imaginary direction. so cos and sin are now in the same direction, yet are calculating using different values? yeah im confused. he finds e again with the cos and i*sin though. 7:34 - i dont know how to prove that this sigma notation (aka the addition function that im too lazy to explain it myself now just look it up) is euler's identity but i guess it just is. also creative by incrementing the n every time it shoots out a value 7:45 - tsc makes a shield using unit circle and pi then turns it into a cylinder. very nice. 8:16 - tsc turns sine into a baseball bat and hits the circling dot thingy drawer into e, while also making a sine curve in the meantime. really creative. 8:22 - i dont really understand how the hell does that work but it works soo i dont care. 8:29 - tsc takes a 9, a 1 and sin with cos to combine it all into some function using a dot as an input. weird. but cool that its a gun now. 9:25 - this part makes me irritated. you saw that tsc used the tan function and used its inputs for the function inputs? yeah. if you input infinity in there it doesnt work like that. maybe they just added in it like that so it just makes the gun super powerful or something? 9:46 - yeeeeaaaah no. i cant prove this. do it yourself. 9:57 - intergration or however you spell it function thing. 11:25 - the imaginary dimension 12:24 - this part says "EXiT" if you didnt notice, tsc was asking for help to exit this place. 12:35 - i sends you to the imaginary dimension, and iiii is i^4 or i^2 * i^2 or -1 * -1 which is 1 so it just sends e back to the real plane without anything happening. 13:05 - e opens up his sigma function equation and changes it out a bit to alter the dimension of the circle and then sets it to imaginary to invert it back into the real world i guess. 13:40 - finally, in the end, all e's friends come to greet him and they go their way. (also if you really dont understand the symbols, i dont too except the phi [ф] and the aleph [א] symbols, and the aleph one is really large cause of the aleph null thing, aleph null being an infinite set of the numbers.)  took a long time to write anyway Please Like And Subscribe!
My fav subject in my fav channel is real!1!1!1
This fight nearly brought me to tears.
i never knew i would like math this much
An awesome job Alan! Every reference I could understand made me laugh :D
א? 13:50 זה בעברית.  (it's in hebrew)
Combining math and animation was your second greatest idea... The first was this channel
I lerned from this more then 2 moths of school
0:35 WHAT DID BRO JUST DO??
4:15 trignometry started FINALLY
we all can rely on alan to let out bangers like these keep it up🎉🎉🎉
This has combined my two favorite things
Where did SC go?
2:51 that is why anything /0 = infinity or something undefined
We need video like this but about Programming
i love how the like count is 420k
I wanna know how the heck Orange learned math fast than ALL of us could in like 12 years.
wouldve been nice seeing the gaussian integral turn into negative inf to 0 and 0 to positive inf integrals at 10:50 lol
Hands down, this is the coolest thong I've watched all day
Did any of you actually understand the math here? My brain still kinda crashes when I see letters in math...
Our Alan Becker, very good guy!!!! For those who like mathematics this video was very funny, laughs too much!
that Was AWESOME!!!! I loved that I felt like I understood the math that was happening to cause all the different modifications and effects being presented
You made me just get an A on my Test bro.
Dude Alan can make anything into a fun video
That's so clever
Am i the only one, who doesnt know why he first wants to kill e and then sudenly they are friends
muito maneiro, adoro matemática
bro just taught me quantum physics
how did tsc get in here in the first place?
作った人天才だろ。
This is what tony stark suppose to be.
2
It would be so fun to experiment with the literal infinite possibilities in math
Every teacher must use this video
13:50 The + End = The End
you seriously brought me out of my boring life. this is the first time im watching such a creative video
Coldest video I’ve seen on YouTube in the last few months 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's like he is creating some sort of world saving formula
Now Orange are a Math Master  And I am one Stupid .-.
it was really funny
Te quedó re epico
blud is in a khan academy video
bro I've never loved math like an anime, props to you dawg
Please Alan my brain you’re hurting it
Ok we need to make a multiplayer war game based on math   Whos with me?
Nossa cara isso foi maravilhoso
I have realised something horrible today. You can’t create a huge giant superlaser with pure math.
Bro took school to the next level
The animation is cool and all, but is nobody going to talk about the music? It feels like a Pixar movie up in here.
big mother N?
Beautiful
I'm glad...
Tg
Was that Alaph Nol as the giant at the end?
170 sadly
1+1=2
Мой самый лучший урок математики
I understood nothing
bro learned math in 5 mins💀💀💀
math fersus animation? more like e fersus animation
best than primary school
pov how your math teachers see math
What our math teachers would expect us to do:
love the giant "N" of natural number at the end <3
It all started from 1+1
That was incredible
:O
11"?
I'm proud to say that I understood the 2x2 bow that shot '4' arrows.
This is fucking genius
Thist is good video ❤
Wow, the attention to detail is astounding in this animation. Amazing job!   I love that each evolution the symbols go through are actual identities or other forms of the symbol! Truly feels like it was made for math nerds like me lol.
idk / and squered.... im only 11
1+1=1
Bro this is the best animation i have ever seen from alan becker
Do nada matemática começou a ser muito foda😅
Man playing Dark souls but math.
WAIT IM NOT SUBBED? ok im subbed now
Interesting that I can actually recall some concepts used here even from my Trigonometry and Pre Calc classes in high school. I don’t quite know everything and can definitely tell some newer problem solving methods are used (like newer than when I was in school) but quite entertaining seeing all of these concepts utilized in a unique way.
This was the most insane animation I ever watched.
you turn the most boring things fun
WE NEED A SEQUEL
SO COOL!!!! LOVE IT
Who win!?
En tiktok si gano popularidad
The music is perfect! Gives an air of discovery and mystery
lol im in year 7 / grade 6 in England and i just started learning quadratic equations wtf is all this lol but this animation is top class
Their most difficult enemy yet
this is incredible, it’s not the only video to do this, but it’s a video that makes you remember that math is, and was once considered an art, something that someone could spend their lives towards understanding, not something that teenagers were just required to slave through in school.
Math is an acquiered taste, but oh boy, this is by far the best math lesson I've EVER seen. XD Really cool animation too. :D
haay who from Poland/kto z Polski?
part + two
This separate from lore videos are fire 🔥
my brain is broken!
Here's my interpretation of each scene as a second-year undergrad:  0:00 Addition 1:23 Subtraction 1:40 Euler's identity (first sighting) 2:25 Multiplication 2:36 Division 2:48 Division by zero 3:05 Positive exponents 3:29 Zero and negative exponents 3:40 Fractional exponents and square roots 3:50 Imaginary unit, square root of negative one 4:00 Euler's identity (second sighting) 4:44 a + -a = 0 5:18 The complex plane 5:34 The unit circle 5:38 Definition of a radian 5:59 Polar coordinates 6:39 Definition of pi 6:51 Trigonometry and relationship with the unit circle 7:12 Phase shift 7:19 Euler's identity (third sighting) 7:35 Taylor series expansion for e^x, x=iπ 7:50 Volume of a cylinder (h = 8) 8:25 Hyperbolic expansion for sine and cosine 8:30 f(x) = tan(x) 9:28 Infinite domain 10:00 Calculus boss fight 11:00 Amplitude = 100 11:30 Imaginary realm? 12:10 TSC befriends Euler's identity (wholesome) 12:38 i^4 = 1 13:05 Taylor series expansion for e^x, x=π 13:06 Gamma function, x! = Γ(x+1) 13:25 Reunion with Zeta function, delta, phi and Aleph Null   Definitely my favourite Animator vs. Animation video yet, and I'm not just saying that because I'm a math student. It really says something about Alan's creativity when he can make something like mathematics thrilling and action-packed. Top notch!
damn dude i didnt get it after radical 😂
Everyone Knows 1+2= is 12
Bro, I’m using that to study math really bro 💀💀
It door songe🧐
🅰️🅱️🅾️🅱️🅰️
it would be really cool if there was a video game where you would conquer the world by building super weapons using math like shown in the video
Do Animation Vs. Coding, or Video Games
12:48 imagine if he just turns it and kills the orange stick figure 😅
Make more of these
Part 2?
Hermoso
Ill try my best to explain everything here... so lets go Keep in mind I'm only 13 so I don't know everything in the video lol  0:20 Simple addition, 1+1. I know you guys understand but I said I'll explain, didn't I?  Here's a kindergarten way. There's a number line and you have to find out what m + n is. You start at m and keep counting n spaces. The number you stop at is the answer. EG: 1 + 1. If you count 1 space past 1 you get 2.  1:24 Subtraction. Same as addition instead of counting forward n, you count backward n spaces.  1:35 Negative numbers. Theres two number lines, positives (1,2,3...) and negatives (-1,-2,-3...) Past zero there's another (imaginary) number line which goes into the negatives. The negatives are basically all numbers under zero, a simple way to get into the negatives is to subtract a smaller number by a larger number EG: 1 - 2 = -1. You can calculate this simply by reversing the equation. E.G: 36 - 48. You could reverse it and find that 48 - 36 = 12, and just switch it around and add a negative to the twelve, to make 36 - 38 = -12. Also, every positive number (1,2,3...) is actually +n. This is why in algebra, when you are finding for X, eg 1 + X = 4, when you have to take 1 to the other side, you turn it into -1 to make X = 4-1, or (+)X = (+)4 - 1.  1:40 when -1 becomes e^(i(pi)), or e^(i×pi), this is a reference to a mathematical equation which finds that e (Euler's number, which is approximately 2.71828) raised to the power of i (the imaginary number, which is the square root of -1.) Multiplied by pi (this is aproximately 3.1415, this is the ratio of the circumference (the area around a circle) to the diameter of the circle (this is the straight line which runs through from one end of a circle, through the centre of a circle and to the other end.). It is also an infinite number.), when put together, e^i(pi) is equal to -1. e^i(pi) is also a part of Euler's identity, which states that e^i(pi) + 1 = 0.  1:50 i(e^(i(pi))), can also be read as i × -1, this equals to -i. This is why when the e^i(pi) creature does it, it opens a doorway to the other dimension (likely the negatives dimension.)  2:13 when you subtract a positive from a negative, which is the same as adding negatives to a negative, it simply makes the number infront of the negative larger. For example, -1-1-1, can be read as (-1)+(-1)+(-1) which is -3. Think of it as going further back on the number line. If you subtract negatives, you would have to remove the number from the original number. Say -m-n. You would start at -m, and would have to go back -n spaces.  2:17 a negative negative is a positive. -(-3) is a positive. Every time you add a negative to a number, it switches to the other number line. Like if you add a negative to a number on the negative number line, it switches over to the positive number line.  2:24 Multiplication. When you multiply a number by another number, you add the original number the same amount of times as the number you multiply it by EG: n×m. You have to add n to itself m times. Like 3×4 is equal to 3 added to itself 4 times (3+3+3+3) which is equal to 12.  2:35 a "/" functions the same as a "÷". However, a "/" is more used than the "÷" to show fractions. For example, 1/2 and 1÷2 both equal 0.5, but 1/2 is also a way to show ½. They're basically the same thing.  2:37 Division. If you were to divide n by m (n÷m), you would have to find out how many times you can subtract m from n without the number going into the negatives (if they are both positive).  For example, 8÷4 = 2 because you can subtract 2 from 8 4 times 8 - 2 = 6 (1) 6 - 2 = 4 (2) 4 - 2 = 2 (3) 2 - 2 = 0 (4)  2:50 So you can't divide anything by zero because no matter how many times you subtract zero, the number will never change  3:02 n(m) is the same as n×m.  3:04 n² is the same as n×n  3:16 nª is n times itself a times  3:29 anything to the power of 0 is equal to one, except for 0. 0⁰=0.  3:32 n^-m = 1/n^m Eg: 3^-2 = 1/3² = 1/9  3:36 any number over itself is always equal to 1. And since any number to the power of one is the original number, eg 5¹ = 5, 4¹ is equal to 4.  3:39 the square root of a number is a number that, when Multiplied by itself, equals the original number. The square root of 4 is 2 because 2×2 is 4.  3:58 Again, the square root of -1 is i, and because nobody really knows the true value of i, i+i is equal to 2×i, or 2i.  4:01 since i×i is -1, -1 × i is -i, and because e^i(pi) is -1, i(e^i(pi)) is also -i. This equation is basically-i = -i.  4:16 cosine and sine are both trigonometrical functions. -cos(pi)+isin(pi)=1  4:22 e^i(pi)-(pi) = e^i×0. Since anything Multiplied by zero is zero, this becomes e^0, which is 1. On a number line, the straight line is from (-1,0), to (1,0). Which is basically e^i(pi) to e^0.  4:49 one detail here is that the creature is holding a Subtraction sign for the base and TSC is holding a plus sign so both the creature and TSC's number keeps going down   4:56 here, he tilts the addition sign to make a Multiplication sign, and uses two twos. So the bow is basically 2×2, and thats why it shoots fours.  4:56 e^i(pi) becomes e^i(pi/4) This equates to approx (square root of 2)/2, which is at 45° on the unit circle, which is where the creature went.  5:18 this references the number line. As you may know, left and right are negatives and positives, but up and down are positive ans negative "i"s.  5:36 this is the unit circle.  5:37 here the solid line is the radius and the symbol at the centre is the theta.  5:41 the highlighted parts are radians. They're the angle in the counterclockwise direction that goes from the centre and has the arc (a part of the circumference) measure 1.  6:44 I skipped some and I just want to say that I have no idea why or how he split pi into cos and sin.  6:50 here it's the line that's formed when you plot sin on a graph, aka a sine wave.  6:55 and here's the line that forms when you plot cosine on a graph.  7:11 idk this so it's just an assumption but I think that when you multiply sin by i it flips it 90 degrees?  7:36 here is sigma (infinity) at the top, and n=1 at the bottom. At the back it is (i(pi))^n/n!  N! Is n Multiplied by everything before it. And this equation is basically saying that you need to do (i(pi)) to the power of 1 (it increases by n every time, in this case it's 1)/n factorial. And the infinity shows that it goes on forever.  I'm tired, ill continue when I get some replies

bro this was one of the best Alanbecker animations the fact that i knew all the math stuff involved here made it 100x better
fantastic
Help!
I didnt watch your content in years. But i didnt expect you would still be publishing bangers. Your content has one of the most consistent quality, great job
The devided by 0 one was so real I actually freaked out. That was so cool
13:51 well, so close
Respect to orange (TSC) for going through 12 entire grades within 10 minutes.
Wow, your animation is very good, it's like an anime or cartoon
Amazing art, amazing animation, amazing as always
what did i miss for him to be fighting math this hard with math😶
*Where do you go when you’re negative?*

This video ngl showed me and gave me a better understanding of how math works
I've always tried to teach my little sister and cousins the power math holds. I couldn't get them away from the screen and now they do there math and my phone's being blown up in the afternoon
9:23 Orange and math stop!
i want Animation vs. 9/11

orange so love math:)
I didn’t think it was possible, but now I have a favourite YouTube video
8 times any number
10:02 cute
please make a animation vs minecraft game
This made math something cool
Bro, I've followed you on various sites since i warched the original animation vs animator, and ive gotta say, this is amazing af! Imagine turning this into a game, where by changing the number, you get different effects, and it teaches people about these equations amd functions without them even realizing it..
1+1=2
Just like math  complida

If math were useful on your daily life.
man if this guy worked with tpot it would be super good
The animation IS AMAZING !! I love this !  I love the music too! Can You tell me the music do You use for this video please ?
I’m gonna need this for my SATs
Wher is Ln 😢
Alan Becker made math a whole movie
Can someone explain me, what exactly does the ending mean? Btw VERY GOOD job Alan! Love your videos

When mathematics are entertaining:
-'' Amazing, MATH!
math is good, the one who teach it is not good if they make us boring, just make a game about math, use number as weapon and attack some villain like infinity, pi or omega ( my idea ) and it will be popular
That animation was AMAZING! You have to make more of those because that got over 400 thousand likes and 6.5 million views.
Damn... this is mindblowing
hello
I love math so much. This made me so happy.❤❤❤❤

I`ve got a idea for an animation animation vs windows 11 update, also thanks for my childhood like this is waaaaay better than todays kids tiktok and another sh***
I hope math helps orange in the new series
Now this is true talent 👏 👌 🙌
can somebody make a list of all the reference of the mathemathical expression that being use. im not familiar with many of it.
🤓🤓
Teachers: you will use math in your life  The math in your life:
10:03that scream
I swear to god i learned more math in this video than i ever learned in my entire life
Awesome 😮
math lesson gone horribly wrong
trully thats mind blowing.just imagine that you can just make a teleporter or dimensional door just by calculate it.and the way that you kinda make a separate sector to import the stickman to their original dimension
What is 227 to 2999?
Those sounds are like someone is upgrading weapons 💀
Wow if math was like this for 10000% sure it will be my Favourite subject.
Yooo that was insane!! What a cinematic masterpiece!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️ Wow man💯💯
I'm glad you upload another video😊
you some how found a way to make math look cool
I love aleph just being huge and walking at the end.
I finally understand what cos and sin are 😂
I can imagine a game like this with puzzle and action sections.  Maybe even with "super hot" style time mechanics so you can stop and think about it in the middle of the boss fights.  If someone ever makes a game like that, I'd definitely buy it.
This made me like math more
Wait so did the thing… delete the stickman…? Cuz -1 is less than 0 but does that mean he just goes on the other side of the grid…? I’m confused 😭😭😭
I wish classes taught like this
The ( . ) is a point on a graph and it has no volume
I feel like most comments are either kids or people who never learned math
This is genuinely one of the most creative animations I've seen on YouTube
1+1=2              😅
Incredible
7:49 duude I was so hoping TSC would try to replace the infinity to 22 or something so -1 would run out of 'ammo' lmao
😢😢😢😢watched you for a long time

Learn Maths with Alan Becker ^^ Nice Work Thumbs up :)
The ( i ) represents the square root of -1

How to make math entertaining:
The amounts of Leonardo DiCaprio pointing at the screen meme I've done in this video is proof that i like math
Show this to a kid, he will love math Show this to a high schooler and he will dreaming about math being this Show this to an Asian, he will say that this is the monster, they've been attacking to graduate school Show this to a teacher, he will say, that this is, why you need math...to survive And in total, math just rules the world. Your videos are awesome, so mich information in an cartoon like video. Keep it up👍👏➕🤩
The funny thing is the math is actually mathing
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I just imagine like : red : “ yo orange where were you at “  Orange “ I made friends with math “
Как всегда шедевр
I just realised that i didnt know 100 - 1 - 1 - 98 = 0
I concluded that TSC is smarter than me
video: animation vs maths me: cant figure numbers mentally due to dyscalculia
Damn do coding next❤
Man. U amazing
His IQ is growing!
stop it!!!!!!!😡😡🤬🤬
Best of the sound
good animation Congrats!
Damn you Alan teeaching me maths in an animation vs video
The ominous gargantuan silhouette at the end, was that ...the "X"?
Fantastic animation, unfortunately I'm too much of a moron to understand anything past the first minute lmfao.

This is shows what could be happen if schools mixed with imagination  This way you not look at math science like a homework instead you look at math like a game and understand that way. İts like having a new vision whatever you look at numbers act like items,enemies or allys this way maybe we able to understand what past geniuses see the world. I thought like this even ı hate math bu this way maybe ı would loved math
Animator vs Teacher Would Be Great
Animation vs my least favorite subject, great job as always!
Context??    * proceed to show 3000 links to pages that do teach mathematics🧠💥🤯☠️ *
That briliant
This video makes me think that Alan saw the Veritasium viseo with the epic math duel thumbnail and took it literally.
I obviously am not good at maths, so I'm asking: What the actual heck is that alef (Hebrew's consonant) at the background?
As a math-lover, i want another video like this 😆 it's so insane
Bro this vid has been posed for 2 days and it already has like 6.6m views-
I thought the start of the video was corn hub 😳
first time from long time i realy happy while watching any youtube video
Bro's math genious
8:40 reminds me of zerg rush lol. TSC my man summed up math as a whole in 14 mins edit: the battle cry at 10:02 im losinf my mind
I want part 2
Love the golden ratio at 6:55
everything about this is superb. The animation, the math , the visualization, the music, the sound effects.
so creative
who knows if there is such a game, I think it would be cool to play such a game
Too much ads
if only i can learn math as fast as sc ;-;
mis sueños antes del examen de matematicas:
This is how fast AI can learn to weaponize math if you just show it how 1+1 works
Blud woke up and decided to make maths epic 💀
Pra quê aula de matemática se tem isso 😂😂
I don’t think I have had this much fun with math since 2nd grade
This is so cool, i would love this as a series
Next Video: Animation vs. Languages
Engineering students watching this video:"    *M A G N I F I C E N T* "
epic.
Math is my favorite subject now
finally, something new.
If only teachers taught this way
1+1= 11 2 0
Math but it dooms the world
He dosn,t now
J.B says 11 but I do 2 J.B bad
becouse of this video i like math now lol
POV fun math
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
We need the e=mc² sequel
great, from hunted to enemies to peace and friends, into a new world 👍
You've done it again alan, great work
Just noticed a tiny detail. At 8:39 you can see the -, r, and θ on the ground from when they were launched away a bit ago, and a few seconds later some e^iπ's pick them up and carry them away. The e^iπ's had control over the circle, and that's why it started expanding at 8:50
please next animation vs. Roblox
Math lessons in the past: 🤭 Math lessons in 2023:😲🤯

I want a part two to this
Math would be amazing if it was taught like this
Good
I learned more about math in this video than in 4 years of high school
I have maths exam tomorrow... U just made maths very interesting for me❤️‍🔥😍
How can you not say aww to certain parts of this
I've never found math more interesting!
8:30
Creativity and quality of sound effects are better than many film production companies.
cool math games trailer
pourquoi il ya une lettre de lalef beth en hebreu a la fin
New fear unlocked: Aleph null
I was thinking that it would be cool if you also do "animation vs terraria" because there are many and unique monsters there. And it is gonna be good on stickman's to because it was a 2d game.
Why does =f(•) turn e^(i*pi) into 0 at 8:43?
And nowadays parents say children can't learn basic math on YouTube, I can see this video being used in public schools in the future to not only make them learn math, but also think is fun to do it with the power of imagination. Without math, there wouldn't be RPG games or heck, most videogames at all.  Next time you think a subject is boring, please, open your mind and prove to yourself why is it boring and find a solution to make it easier and enjoyable.
We need a whole series on this
orage made a gun from math dam he is genius!!!!!
we want next episode!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want a game like this
I never thought that I'd ever enjoy something related to math
Eu creio que ele está dentro da calculadora do computador do Alan

As a 7th grader, this vedio just tuaght me everything i ever need to know in life in under 15 minutes.
Bro We want Wanted - Ep 2 ❤❤ ASAP
More, MORE
Would like to see math teachers and professors react to this
This is AMAZING The world needs more math content like the demonstrations that were happening here. What dj said about that 1 being where it all starts is actually not even entirely true: what is "1"? Ah, 1=1? Ok. Now we have a defined building block (albeit defined as itself, but that is the most important rule in math: x=x. Everything is equal to itself. Without self-equality, nothing works.) I love those representations of multiplication and division and the process and joy of discovering math from square "1" And the e^(ipi) running off feels accurate to the way math is taught, where complex numbers get introduced briefly when you learn about square roots, and then get shoved under a rug for a while. I also love how you transitioned into the circle stuff through the complex plane, which is an incredible way to justify dealing with circles, as a way to deal with complex numbers.
Masterpiece

Alan makes a perfect mix of action comedy and calming
Author please tell me the name of the music urgently!
What teachers think we’ll use math for:
I cried, I don’t know exactly why, but I do love to understand these concepts, and they feel as magical as this. To create a universe in my head where the rules are set but the playground is infinite is mesmerizing. I think that visualizing this beyond my head and in such a spectacular fashion made me understand that people that get joy from math as I do exist, and it gives me comfort. Thank you!
Cómo amo a este tipo lpm
I think that if math were this way sure I'll get 0 at everything 😢
you made math fun  *how*
Esta increíble!!! x•x=✓Ahora uno de música!!

Holy crap that was AWESOME
Share this with all your math-hating friends to change a life.
Epic animation Alan, Animation and Match Is epic
I got goosebumps 14 mins straight
they made math look cool.
EPIC
my asian american father wants to thank @alanbecker for getting me and my younger brothers intrested in math. he also said "this would be the best also most asian. game about. just take cool math game and replace it with this."
Господи, он сделал танк, как только ему дали калькулятор. А ещё, кстати, музыка на фоне набирает глубину с каждой новым способом исчисления, люблю такие детали

8:39 omg this is amazing
This guy learned everything in seconds for sure
IT'S REALLY COOL!!!!!!!!!!!
9:51 transformations like this in films is always so badass
The man who made math interesting
Ey, the only time I'll actually enjoy anything math related.
What's amazing is that I've seen similar beauty in programming! I would love to see such an animation depicting the dramatic and often exquisite ways of solving problems through program logic...
Suddenly as a math hating student I must say I enjoy this show very much
this is fucking insane
THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME, I LOVE TI
This is my favorite video :)
At first I thought this was basic arithmetic but TRIGONOMETRY?
*Math* is The Most *Powerful Subject.*
Моя мама связана с наукой и ей очень понравилось ;>
This. Those is what YouTube is about. Mind-blowing.
Who said math is boring?
One of greatest video of all time
Imagine part 2
We had number lore and alphabet lore... now we got math lore. Truley amazing
i am waiting for animation vs dragon ball
So cool this animation!
This is why I hate math both cause of how relatable and cause I know like none of those advance equations
so interesting!
What the hell was that? :D
1+1=2
2:51 This is what happens if you try to divide by 0 (Infinite -0's)
this thing was actually tough to understand  but it was good

Now we know what actually happens in the movies where people operate a floating screen with hands they solve maths 🤣
Esse vídeo me ensinou mais q a escola,que será eu tivesse esse vídeo quando eu ainda estudava
now if u ever find math boring think of this
We need a video of mathematicians reviewing this video
What subjects is he gonna fight next?
pov: Einstein learn and enderstand math

Like for part 2
I didn’t understand half of that, but it was cool
Incredible, it's a great way to understand mathematics. We look forward to more videos like these :D
We want part 2. Love from India.
10/10 film making
Pls more this video
This is crazy
I cant believe I watched the whole of animation vs minecraft because I saw alan animate TSC fighting against math
22 млн
=f(•) minigun
Oğlum öbür videoyu yap la
O cara melhorou a matematica em um nivel absoluto
Okay I definitely need a mathematicians reaction/analysis on this because I only understand like 50% of this
WHY ON THE END THERE IS A huge א
now yes i like math
Has there been an animation vs coding yet? Is not you should try to make one😊
Math looks complicated, sure glad that I passed
this is very good + bro figthing with an centimeter 😂
Aa que perfeito, perfeito, perfect ♥️💚💛💜❤️💕💞🖤💖💗💙🧡💟.
א ?   ,    It's in Hebrew
Animation + Sound + Maths = Terrific 🔥
HOW DID YOU ACTUALLY MAKE MATH F U N ! ? /POS
This video is amazing, and the sound effects are the cherry on top. Love it as always!
This is the best video!
א
Im soooo confused
This is absolutely amazing
OMG 😱 ❤
Bro knows where infinity is

yez
i love how alan beckers team create a musical masterpiece for each and every episode
more
Who knew that math could be fun for everyone 😂
😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Блин почему столько эпика за 14 минут это шикарно прлсто супер
That was Literally the Best Math Lesson i ever Seen Thank you Alan ❤
he made a perfect circle thats crazy 5:35
The second chosen is the second chosen math nerd 🤓
11:08 say good bye mate
😍
I didn't know someone could make math look FUN
I said it Before and I will say it Again The Second Coming is a Genius  I just Love how he is good in Everything he try  Minecraft , League of Legends and now Math He is Definitely my Favourite Character from Alan Becker ❤
めちゃくちゃおもしろいです！ちょうど今日数3まで終わりましたけどこの動画は良い復習になります！
It’s a Minecraft video where the stick figures lose colour
The moral of the story is that math almost always kicks your butt.
Geeze!! Math just blew my mind 😲 🤯
As i predict, there will be Animation vs History (From beginning to modern day)
Alan:what happened with my calculator!?
Alan can you make a video? Called losing colors.
TSC: Using all of these math numbers and combining things to beat Euler^ipi Me: adds 1
Animation vs. Algebra
Very esoteric mathematics and physics, although I am only in junior high school, I love mathematics and physics very much！
this should be AAA game, so that kids finally start to appreciate math
you really made math interesting
And we students say we have to deal with maths more
Nahhh if this was how math classes are math would be the BEST subject and would be the number 1 favorite subject of all
Well now I know what to do in math class now😂
OMG🤨
Bros a storm trooper with a bow
BEST ANIMATION EVER BABYYYYYYYYYYY!
Tha
Никогда не дружил с математикой. Я её не трогаю, она меня ^_^
I hate math
Pov you dont know math:
hello sir, what is your software called please?
Aleph 0
Canon or not, seeing TCS doing all this math that mathematicians spend years learning baffles me. Great work as always Alan!
This dude just explained every math lesson in 14 minutes,insane
🤯😍😍🤩
bro you nailed it! 💥
Speed  0,25x = GREAT MOVIE
eptvaymat.
🤤
What was the big N at the end.
I prove that alan becker is a father.....
north Korean math stories.
The fact that he does all the small animations
I watched this before my math final I think it helped a bit
Nice
П. З.
Imagine if Doctor Strange knew math
1+1=2
bro just did the thing that every teacher fail --- making math cool

The dawn of a new animation. Math series?
Bro made an animation that my mind cant calculate
1+1=2
this is just awesome
God tier animation💀💀
I dont understand crap, but this is gold
Math is easy lesson  The Math :
It's just like wow it's so good it's better than 99% of all the movies I've seen.
Math, but in real life 😂
This episode is top tier
animation vs meth-
1+1=2
This is one of the best math videos I have ever seen. So many concepts are given, and in a super imaginative way. It is a masterpiece.
i am proud to be a nerd 🤓
wow
This is doing numbers
hayy vãi chưởng
So würde mathe selbst mir Spaß machen 😂😂😂
I need mathematician explain what's happening
nerd
10:01 e scream
man made math become a war
Make him Math professor he will teach the others
Alan Becker's animations never fail to amaze me
10:03 the final boss of math- tf
Insane.
"Animations vs Terraria" - My dream
(don't show this to americans, they would be really confused)
😮😮😮😮😮
As someone who barely scraped by calculus this is giving me anxiety. Excellent animation though.
8:16 - 8:17 was sooo coll
YES!!! Now this… this is a masterpiece!!!
10/10 so fucking good!
After all these years of math this is the greatest video ever. I'm crying man. This is the anime for math nerds. It's like I get all the reference cause I watched like a million episodes of this show.
I absolutely LOVE the action with the maths in
Pls animation vs math part 2😢
Footage of God making the universe
Bpro went from kindergarten to college 😂🎉
un show más be like :
give him a calculator
Do the physics or.......
Now I can learn math from this video. Thank you very much, 10 out of 10
I have a theory of how orange got there, orange probably got knocked out by the guards and put him in a simulation. In the simulation he has to fight math and when he escaped, he went to another simulation. Because the guards are testing him to see how smart he is.
The math behind this blows my mind. Its brilliant how you visualize the concepts in ways that are unique and very understandable. SOLID. Well done.
Imagine the teacher teaching their material like this
Calculadora melhor jogo do mundo
Thanks Alan Becker now I know power
im not even watching the video anymore dude
oh yeah, distorsing reality itself with math, just another average day in TSC's life
We need 3Blue1Brown for a reaction and breakdown!😂
I wonder what my middle school math teacher would say about this
Dude orange must be genius in math
I WANNA BE MATH TEACHER 😡 NOW
вааааааааааааааааууууууууууу
f and infinity and 1+i +e and whatever that is,is way above my level but very cool video as always
i watch this and this theory hurt my brain (well not really)
I think you should do animations vs geometry dash
Mathematical formulas are the deadliest🗿
masterpiece
No, no other needed to talk, I just love this video
The editor needa raise I mean the animated needa raise Edit: animater*
bro, try to make animation vs natural science, but all animation
how called the symbol in the end like N
-_-
11111{2023}11111
ЭТО ШЕДЕВР! БОЖЕ АЛАН ГДЕ ТЫ УЧИЛСЯ ЭТО МЕГА КРУТО
NON ENDING NUMBER
#14:02
Make english bro if no i will not call u elon musk😇
I’m never going to leave school until I understand absolutely everything going on 😂
I hope next video is about physical
Please teach math with animmation
THATS SO COOL!
"A war with math" someone named Alan said
The thing that i love about this animation is by using all math equations and solving methods really cleverly to make it more cool, entertaining, and educational. Plus the futuristic music and really cool sound designs. props to Terkoiz for planning this amazing animation! I would love to see more animations like this in the future!. Keep up the Amazing work Alan!
The BIG NUMBER IS ♾️ 🤓
This proves that thinking is hard
1 + 1 = 2
Hey Alan thank you for learning the things that I dint know and THE+end=the end
its like a movie
100/100 wow keep it up!!!
What do I have a feeling that we may have not seen the last of this I have a feeling that there might be possibly a series coming up about this but that is Alan's choice
if only Einstein was around to see this
THIS IS SO FUCKING AWESOME!!!
Alan, this is phenomenally CREATIVE and OUTSTANDING!! The animation, creative ideas and the math are very impressive. Amazing job, Alan!
I stopped understanding when the negative numbers ended
Make more parts for wanted
this is what i imagine how smart people calculate in their head
this looks fun
The+End=TheEnd
My dreams in school be like
Whenever I learn whatever e to the power of i and pi is, I’ll remember this video
Слишком сложна
It was amazing
this is so creative
Pov: me destroying math
13:46 I loved the idea of Aleph (ℵ) being a transparent graphic giant, since it's one of the symbols that considerate the infinite.
Assuming this is original music, could yall upload that file in a separate video? Gracias
С каких пор математика круче аниме и марвел?
Thank you now I understand what pi means
This was such a legendary video. The way you started from scratch and told the whole epic story. It is super awesome. It is such an interesting idea to make maths epic stories. Today I learnt that math is such a magical subject. And yes I only knew half of this math 😂
Math some one bullys you for being a math nerd you show him a vid and he be like: 😐🤯🤯 math noew is my favorite subject
Вот такая математика мне бы зашла)
most of us lose this fight🤣🤣🤣
Man I haven’t a clue what any of these numbers and letters are but I sure do love when the orange man does violence with concepts as weapons.
best video i've ever seen.it's like a 1.9B dolar movie prjected in Ronaldos basement!!!!!!
What will be next? Animations vs Physics?
This makes math look cool ngl
Wtf does thnd(2e) mean bro lmao. But really, Tsc really broke Math? Damnnnn
Multi rendering
what the hell did I just witnessed.....
this made my brain go you didn’t have to cut me off
Bro ur edit is insane when the combination of maths subject😬. Is 100/100👍
This math so hard
Math is very easy            If ur smart🗿
ALAN WHAT THE HELL ARE U DOİNG YOUR CRAZY
I’m a big math kid so not only is this video really good, it’s even better for me.
Animation vs math the unwinnable challenge
very gooddddd
I basically understand ALL of the math here. Its unreal. Thank you so much for this animation. This is easily my favorite video of the year!
What about Animation vs physics I would like to see if there's one
Hehe...the math managerie.  Nicely done, though a follow-up with the Aleph series would be cool.
1+1=3
finally someone maked math fun
Bro is almost the new Albert Einstein
The best thing is that it’s all correct 😭
"Best Animation Award in Asia"
Why am I crying
There is a video with the same name that is exactly the same except with different colours
So finally something useful to do with calculus. 😁
math teachers be like when they see this video: we gotta hire him to teach math
6 MILLION GIEWS IN 2 DAYS THAT'S CRAZY
e^(iπ), truly the greatest nemesis.. and friend.
subject like
Tôi rất thích xem bạn nó thật hay và bổ ích  Cảm ơn Alan
my brain after watching this video: *die
i want a video game like this, weather it be math or just random game stuff i want it.
=f(°)
peak!
bro did 0 damage all the time but still solos
This is one of the greatest animations to do with math I’ve ever seen. Just one slight issue I’ve found, when the split occurs at 8:34, isin(π) should go to (e^(iπ)-e^(-iπ))/2 instead of having 2i in the denominator. The 2i means you divide by the i and you get only sin(π) and not isin(π). Other than that, splendid stuff!
How did you manage to make it so cool
what is math?
Man drew a perfect circle
Es impresionante como Alan Baker puede volver una idea tan simple en una tan Epica
[Math] IS LEGAL IN ITALY!
Next episode:Animation vs alphabet
How is an orange stick-figure better at math than me
it would be a cool idea to break down each math concept in this video. still in 9th grade and really curious about the levels of math here
6:26 HELICOPTER HELICOPTER
Its all fun and games until imaginary numbers are in play
Alan Becker and his team are experts at what they do. The combat, the math, the concepts at play, make every second extremely entertaining. 10/10, Alan. Well done.

Reason to learn math:
Groundbreaking work!
do a movie about physics pls :)
Nunca pense que las matemáticas fueran como una especie de Arte. Y fueran bonitas de observar
How is this not on Netflix this should be movie
Quien dijo que las matemáticas hiban ahcer dificiles xd
Truly an asian animator.
+ brain
today i wrote a math test… and a German test… and I got my French test back- I swear I had no idea what I was doing in math and in German luckily my parents are chill with grades but none of my teachers told us to learn and I think we’re writing another test tomorrow
cool and amazing
Bro just taught everyone mathematics. Right, we don't need school
This makes me love math even more.
Ohhh...I feel I can get the full score in the next math exam😊
Can we get a second one?
Remember....it starts by 1
Das ist das bisher beste Mathe-Video was ich mir je angeschaut habe, gerne mehr solcher Mathe-Videos. Hat mächtig Laune gemacht sich das Video anzuschauen und man kann durchaus auch was davon lernen.
This is the most great video ever Alan, is really awesome!!!
I'm Sorry. This is math? I've been learning wrong my *_WHOLE LIFE!_*
Note 272882
Definitly it was the best thing ı have ever seen
how?
How can you turn math into a darksouls boss.
i think bro knows math
Ngl I thought this was gonna be a colab with Kahn academy
The best animation I have ever seen 👏👌
i swear to god this wasnt just some dream i had 2 years ago
This is my brain during a math test
Math is powerful
ESTOY FLIPANDO EN TODOS LOS COLORES DEL MULTIVERSO, ES UNA DE LAS PASADAS Q HE VISTO DEL EQUIPO DE ALAN Y SIGO RECORDANDO TODAS Y CADA UNA DE LAS LEYES Y REGLAS MATEMÁTICAS Y AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ME FALTAN PALABRAS PARA DESCRIBIR LO ASOMBRADO,FELIZ ,MARAVILLADO Q ME DEJO ESTO  No hay otra palabra para describir lo q vi: ES POESIA , ES ARTE NUMERICO Y MATEMATICO!! Ò,u,Ó)
Hi alan
В этом 14 минутном ролике все 9-11 классов матеши☠
I want to sit here and find out each little refrence, but ut will take so long
This is insane, the creativity mann
cool + video
Даже тут Алан угостил нас файтингом
7:00  When the two best students got different answers))
π°¢e@€¥____2
WOW!
Yoooh the next YOMI Hustle character looks sick
Animação incrível e tem que saber muito de matemática para fazer coisas assim, meus parabéns
alan casually making math multidimensional weapons
Can you do animation vs Science?
Math discover of guardian Cool game
Wow, this has definitely got to be the greatest and most complicated animation Alan Becker has ever made! It probably only took him an extremely long time to animate it because he hasn't been making any videos for a while. Also, I watched this video yesterday, but I couldn't post this comment because I can only do it on my computer now and not phone anymore.
Алан как всегда гениален!
Mate you just made something I think I could learn more from then my first year of high school next year
WOW 😮
Alen Becker you are soo cool how you make that?! Is sooooo good!
History of math
This was absolutely incredible
Imagine this happened on the blackboard in school
For those unfamiliar, E^(i*pi) is -1 which is Euler's Identity.   One of the most beautiful Equations in the universe.
Me imagining stuuf in math class be like:
When you upload wanted animator vs animation and put there and too others superpower not only orange
Это афигенно
This is just amazing eventhough I understood until half if the video. Next? Animation vs python(coding language)?
Become albert Einstein 💀
i thought he was going to try divide something by 0 and the entire place would blow up, but still very cool nontheless
10:24 i love this part of the song because it sounds so techno and portal 2 vibes so i was dissapointed when it wasnt actually part of the song
I didnt know orange is a genius💀
8:30.  He weaponized a FUNCTION of TAN! and made it into a VECTOR, of both DIRECTION AND MAGNITUDE!!!!!. OH YEAH!!!😊
I wanna follow Terkois man, Or atleast pick at their beautiful brain in how the heck did he come up with this behind the scene like holy cow this is so good
After watching this, I would say that to me it was better than watching a movie
واو
Sans can save the animation.Pleeeeeeeeeeeese
10:00 is definitely my favorite part in all this
I like math-universe
this is the best fucking video ive seen in my entire life and its not even close
א
I feel dizzy looking at this world😭
How can I watch this? There is no phonk music playing in the background?
That is like the coolest thing i've ever seen!
Alan becker is the goat at animating, change my mind
coool
I LIKE IT SO COOL. if it cool then please like for me I got 100% in my math test.
Bro is learning to much becomes the Quiet kid💀
Trop bon
How smart you are like i will sub and like
bro have 100/100 on math test
r u know to speak hebro?
10:34 power
bro explained math in 14 min
It hurts me to say that it makes sense- but oh my god it was amazing !!!❤🎉 I wish math was always this fun
Outstanding creativity. Thank you.
Can’t believe someone turned math into something fun
9:28 resident evil 4 P.R.L.412 looks like this
I wonder what it would  like if inside the brain of a math genius show like this while solving a problem.
Did someone tag @3blue1brown already?
Yes daddy teach me all the maths! Also the music is making this feel like I'm in the middle of an ocean looking down the never ending obsess causing me  some heavy vertigo  and unspeakable fear.
while I struggled with math, orange in seconds struggled with his own math
WHAT THEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alan this video got 6.1M views in two days
This made me learn so much more than my teacher teached me 😂
Oyun yapsana abi fazla oynanır
jamás entenderé la matemática
every mans dream when it comes to math...
Now math is my favorite subject
이과들의 눈으로 보는 앨런은 무슨느낌일까 때밋....
I can't believe it
Bro turned to grade 1 to albert god stain💀
Pls part 2
Already lost understanding 1:44
This man should be a teacher, i literally learned something from this video, even tho i'm a 7th grader
Seeing this as a Mathematics Major is truly mind blowing!
Orange in Mathmagic world; awesome!
Well... Except for some incorrect things with the infinity symbol, it's overhaul pretty good and a really good way to teach difficult math with fun. Good job!
Is this about the lore?
Bro is watch so many video math with phonk
11:09 "discord light theme"💀
brother i really love and enjoy this video and your all videos too math is my favorite subject of all time BTW thanks for making this type of video i really love it🥰
So entertaining, not only for the math but also for the quality on music, sound effects and "writing"  Hope Math teachers don't sleep on this video and create step by step explanations for that fight
и не надо ходить на уроки матеши)))
Great work!
A matemática é facinante
what you study for vs. what's actually in the test
Alan's animations never cease to surprise me. Bro made math cool. Nice job Alan!
POV: You're in your math teacher's dreams
Agora entendi matemática ❤
Do more of this, do phonetics and ipa next😊, could be fun playing around with sounds
Oh wow
this is what happened while he was defiant by the unnamed organization?
This we need game
What website do you use?
I would say on a pure creativity level, this a new level for you. Amazing amazing work!
the fact that this is all actually mathamatically accurate impresses me
I'm not good in math but you the best animator
As a math and stickmen enjoyer, this is like a dream :D
🤓Nerd
that scream at 10:02 💀
Pi tt
Alan Becker always stands for his detailed research and creativity.  Hands off to you and your team 🔥.
9:50  Why do i hear boss music?
A true masterpiece!
Just math:nope Math with battle:yes
1+1=2
Just math:nope Math with battle:yes
math is my weakness
his videos are so great that you understand what characters say without words and what they feel without their faces
😲 10/1000000   1:00
lil Mabu dont like this one
1+1=3
Even though im too young to understand what all the fancy symbols mean, this was still amazing
@dateunvlog
I am not a fan of math but I sure love to be understanding some of the things happening in this animation
That was really a high-level battle
Teacher explaining how "Math" is "EASY"
Very interesting, I find the video very creative, creating excitement for viewers😮
Next would be Animator vs Programming
bro straight up broke math
すんげぇ編集力　頭も良くなくちゃ無理だよこんなの　最高❤

You are the best bro
Is this the math dimension?
Nah,This is sick af
Can you do Animation V.S. Latin Script
I don't even know what those harder ones are 😩
Math saved my day kkkkk
This creation remember me the skibidi toilet series
Thanks to this video, I don't need to learn math
Que legal seu vídeo,sou do Brasil
this is educating and interesting at the same time
Well thank you for your service to humanity
then I wonder why I find math so fun
better than lessons for sure
Bu videoyu matematik hocama derste izletmesini söyleyecem
Me when i get 99 from math exam
goose bumps, remiands me ‘Interstallar’.❤❤
This so dope❤
Wow... I can't vibeos like that...
You seriously outdone yourself!! The sound design, math, and creativity behind each move! At times you actually used the 3D space instead of flat 2D!!! INCREDIBLE
now make it with all the other subjects
wait what on earth was that long lanky thing at the end 😅😅🤔
10:55 pretty good and amazing
Can you build animasion of terrraria
Dude... This was FIRE..... HARDCORE.
math: battle mode
Itu sin sama cos pelajaran smk
14:02 this is why I love math
i🥧  e
I am a character FX artist with a degree in physics. Never before have I seen a video that perfectly encapsulates the love I have for math and art. Amazing work. Subscribed. ❤
Imagine you have gone to a place that absolutely nothing but Maths
damn alan, you videos are realy hard to creating
Origin of ie iπ
This is beautiful
Seriously , this is wonderful video but is there anybody that fully understand this video . I got confused of Sin and Cos diagram , how E multipliers themself and the i pie . My knowledge only allow me to understand like 35% and that a lot of things to learn
Nice
13:567:588:030:12 what?
Aleph being gigantic was brilliant and hilarious.
Haven't seen an action like this in a long time
I have never loved math so much
yea this is interesting
This is awesome
thanks i love math now 😁
WUT DA HAILLLLLLL
Surprisingly this made me hate math even more seeing how they could teach us smh
All nerdy mathematicians are gonna love it. Including me 🤩
This is so cool, dramatic, and complicated for just a stick man finding out math but at the same time it's not just a stick man it's a whole other story made from basic shapes numbers and symbols this is just a masterpiece chefs kiss 👌🤌
Episode 6900 of breaking math to it's knees 😂
The moral of the story: i^4=i
Объяснил математику понятней без слов чем моя математичка
Not only did alan becker animated this but he also figured out all of the answers in the video, he is not only good at animating, but also very intelligent
I spent 12 fucking year of hardwork on school and not even better than this stickman in 5 mins
Amazing animation plz make animation vs Letters
i need part 2 but with decimal numbers
La video parfaite 😂
Wow
I didn't understand any of those but i enjoyed the story ❤
ζ e iπ & φ are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
if teacher really mean that math will be useful for future :
he accidentally got into the calculator xd
Una locura
Matematika itu mudah dan menyenangkan bukan ?
Just made this comment to make ur video more popular
Calculator Pro
matrix vibes
As a dude who didn't understand a single thing in this video (because skill issue in math. I don't do math) I can easily confirm it was 100% accurate and is hella creative   Also, how the hell sc learns everything so fast the moment he gets to experience it for the very first time? Like, mf becomes a master in literally everything he touches
いやまじですげぇ。 大学で専門的に習う内容だから普通の人には分からないと思うけどガチですごい。 ほんまに何も分からなかったけど凄いよこれ。
This kinda feels like fortnight
It never made sense to me why you can’t divide by 0, so it’s safe to say this animation definitely opened my eyes to a few things lol
This might be a little tricky but can you make Animator and Fnaf? If not appropriate, please Forget this idea Alan. WARNING: This is an idea, not mandatory.
We need series of this pls
Next time you could make animation vs chemistry
He actually answered the question of "When will we ever use math in our daily lives"
damn, i like math
φ δ ¡
I showed my stickman this, he is now albert stickstien
Сделаешь такую игру???
make more math
Thanks for teaching your young viewers math in a cool way
No one: My drawing book during math:
I want to see Animator vs animation episode 2, its going to so cool, thinking about it already makes me hyped
Asian parents approve.
LETS BRING DIS MAN 1M LIKES
This felt like the MCU except for math, had me  excited about radius like thanos or something djiwixiw
That boy understood more math in 14 minutes than I did in my entire life.  PS: Your animations are always great and this is no exception, great job everyone!
Hey man this confusing my tiny monkey Brain

It's pleasing when you get all the references (btw is this Aleph 0 at the very end ?)
this is absolutely amazing, the visualisation we all needed in class
the reason why math is my favorite subject so many to learn and wholesome ending
I thought this on my math class...😅
Very cool thing.
Wow OMG
Next animation vs ai please
Part 2 Please!!!!
His video made 6m views in one day, let's see how much stacks in one week
taught me better than my math teacher lol

As always, I loved it! But may I ask you what happened to our Orange friend? Did he send him back to where he belongs or he removed him from existence??
:o
What’s that i ixixi
bro knows his math 🤓
so basically it's fun math and counting until math attacks you till death..moral of the story don't do math until you can't understand or it will attack you .
i love how orange was riding a sphere in the laser, he was like I'M COMING FOR YA LITTLE E
This video is so goood
Hi YouTube
I love this...dude that Error...By the way, from the half of the video I didnt know anything. Is far away from my math knowing...you forgot something...”!” :)
Math lore is amazing
e
My brain on math lesson when im fall alsleep belike:
Next up: Physics vs animation.
I learned more Math from this video than in ALL my Math classes, this is Awesome
When I mentioned Alan Becker at the height as an artist I respect, their response was ... "Who?" .... This guy started with a simple animation animator vs animation .. now he makes great crossover stories with his characters and now released , a perfect mathematical spectacle connected to a simple story but so brilliantly done that hats off. I don't care what happened to them, but I will continue to follow his stories, which he permeated in such a way that he creates his own category that he undoubtedly rules. Keep it up.
this video made my maths 100 times easier
This kind of video should me displayed to high school students so that Math does not become a boring subject to them.
Math lesson in Ohio be like💀
I want to see this hero be included in the avengers
Yeah
and you can animation against physics, or against chemistry
Alternate title: Second Coming becomes a math genius to commit mass genocide on a math horde
Favourite
12:29 e×it I love this animation so much, it took me until my second time through to notice this and I just love it.   Gotta admit, I'm at a weird stage with Math in my life right now. I'm a senior, halfway through my first year, and admittedly, I just can't cope anymore. I was tanking hard doing the hardest Math, taking too much advice from those around me. I dropped Extension Maths 2 months in, and just now I'm dropping from Advanced down to standard. Could not be happier with my choice. Math is more just an interest thing for me. Constants are fascinating and the Vsauce videos that explain it even more so. The bit where TCO discovered calc was fascinating to me, as a lesson on Radians was my last in Adv Math.  I adore this animation, Alan&Co.
god i hate calculus
Why only sc
AND ADULTS SAY YOUTUBE DOESNT GIVE YOU INFORMATION
I dare someone make subtitles for the entire video in one comment
Wow absolutely beautiful even though I hate math  This was beautiful
The power of math

Do physics next.
For some reason I cried by these formula  Idk if that's because I can recall all of them or it's just graphical simulation is too beautiful
Dude this video got 6 million views in 2 days!!
alan becker is the only person that can make anything an animation
I thought I knew math
Why
A Masterpiece...  Alan you are the best!!
do physics alan!
i want to go in this verse
years later, some prof will use this as a video lesson
This is probably the most interesting weaponary used in fight I have ever watched. An awesome video, you and your team did a great job. This could also be used to teach more advanced math concepts. Your math nerd should create math lessons.
I learned more math than animation from this video
10:57 bro really said "Let me charge my attack"
Who Comes here From ACS Group 😂❤?  Bangladesh 🙎🏻‍♀️😊
Wow you have great ideas im in sri lanka ❤️💪
When i watch this when im still little "mama i wanna learn this thing called math"
This is the best math fight I ever seen thnx and more with physics plz or biology
Very cool animation! But what did this orange asshole want from the poor e^(i*pi)?
I love math!
I bet you can't do animations: across the netverse.
Animation vs Science?
so whole some :)
Bro fell in the void.
Ok
beautiful
Not possible in education system 💗💗
animation vs physics next: color gang beats up isaac newton
1:40  4:01  7:19
1+1=1
bro what's happening
Bro animation so good bu it hurts my brain
Knk kralsın çok iyi yapıyorsun 😊
As a math and sciences major, alongside being a tutor for highschoolers I absolutely LOVE this animation. What amazes me more is this is how some of my students visualize math, and its incredible.
Even in math Alan Becker knows how to make fun and insane content 🤩
This is so epic! An am🤯azing piece of art!!
God that is pure masterpiece!
1+1=2
QUEDE Alucinado, IMPRESIONADO IMPACTADISIMO Y MAS, TE AMO ALAN❤❤❤
1+1 =2
The death star
The proof that what you learn at school is important 😂
cheeseburger
Did e just used Domain expansion?
Math is my fav
Fun fact orange 🍊 wasn't serius !
Welp one way to be satisfied in math
Bro you teach math better than teachers
nice
1=3
eeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1+1=3
The e’s battle cry would be EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
0:36 bro what he did with the zero that's a little sus 💀
太深奧了
Broooo you are a Einstein😮 WTF IS THISS
2+2=22
Andai guru matematika njelasinnya gini

кто заметил большого симбола в конце лайк мне
I just want to say "pure banger"
Alan beaker go ep2 😅
What is the giant symbol at the end called
7:29 I guess, -2pi and -1pi should be multiplied by i?
its very cute
masterpiece
Orange is the smartest teacher🎉Put him in the history book😂
수포자지만 확실히 알 수 있는것은 이 영상이 천재적이라는 것
Animation vs alphabet
0:29 =3
Yea bro everything go out of my head in math 😂😂😂
Math, The greatest power at the grasp of our hands
Math tests be like:
This is by far the best video I ever seen 🎉
Oh my god
Is it just me or is this kinda trippy
I loved the „The + End”. Btw that was really cool! You are making such a great job Alan! We are proud of you! :))
i like the second coming
Next level bro
the fractured universe
If u understand math, math is your best friend
🟠sve
Sound like matrix

I was sad and amazed
I need wanted ep-2
I kinda fell out of love with mathematics after struggling through my last semester of it, this really helped remind me why love it so much. Math is beautiful sometimes.
I love this Video
This 🤔👍
bro used the scratch font
this is crazy I loved this animation do more content like this and entertain us all the time🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩🤩🤩
🎉🎉🎉 $$$
🐐🐐🐐
This would actually be a good idea for a calculator. It would help visualize math and thus possibly make it more understanding
Does aleph is that storong?
school kids is good film animation
My brain broke after this
If Math is a must-learn for everyone to seeing like that , that will be a favourite subject 😃👏
waow
Я все понял лучше чем за 11 лет обучения в школе
WOW
I will understand in 2100
Wow 😮 vat wow kool n a go ending 😁 i like visit a lat😃😃😃
I love how it all started with 1
The fight was just amazing 🤯🤯
YEA
Animated Euler's formula
Oh, this is just an easy math class for Asian since we need to defeat "e" in five second , or you got "f" , the "failure" But still,  a great animation
Dark souls Edition: math

1+1= 6(||||||)
TSC, a litteral stickfigure gain more knoledge and inteligence in 14 minutes then i did in 6 years..
1+1=11?
Loved it
Math here fr became a avenger level threat lmao
I want autocad 😂
9.58
Having the most beautiful equation in math (when e^iπ equals negative one) be the interactive other in this ep is just BIG BRAIN but without Alan's animation, I wouldn't know why I would be watching this video; he's simply remarkable.
This literally deserves an Oscar. Great work man. If they had explained math like that, I would probably like math..
orange made a killing machine out of the number 1
I domt understand any of this 😭
Awesome🔥
Would math teather love this vidio fuxking
Pov:when you take playing with numbers chapter too seriously 😂
IQ=9999999999
baştan sona matematik
I can't wait for this to become a game
Math has never been so fun before
Crazy how it starts just from a "1=1"
Made math look interesting wow w
Made math look interesting wow w
Made math look interesting wow w
Wow
Amazing. So well made!
Complex numbers are the most fascinating and interesting numbers in the whole Math.
hmm i didnt know that e iπ was such a good math teacher
Dude just showed the hole universe maths 💀💀
Proves orange is smarter than anyone
Wwooww
Man's realy made a 14 minute stickman animation about math XD I love it XD
I want to have an animation and Terraria
The hidden N ._.
This is literally what i Imagine when doing math
Im only a year 8 and my brain commited not live
But where did orange go back home or sum
This, is, MAGNIFICENT
Now I have a new favorite video. It's just peerless.
the animation and sound effects are so good. I love it
too much in one video XD
oh alan becker i watch u in 2018 and all videos got funned
stickman use number to fight math
Padahal aku dari Indonesia tetapi aku suka nonton ini
Viewers: Wow! everything is beautiful. *Complex numbers have joined the chat*
1 day ago
This guy is already better than me and he just discovered math 14 mins ago
I have question, Why orange in the math world?
Alan becker orange is in the symbol world tge first sybol are alive is + 0:39
Alan becker orange is in the symbol world tge first sybol are alive is +
Well, this video is good to learn 6 - 7 yo kids with fun way. Great job Alan😅😅
Who loves math after watching this video?
The + End
Pov t'es en terminale maths expertes 😂
1:21
理系でよかった
“Hello,sara,I very like your works,Can ireprint your works to Chinese website,lwill indicate the author and your tubingaddress.thank you!”
But the real question is, how did the second coming get there in the first place?
Только вздумайте после этого сказать, что математика не опасна и не сводит с ума
this video teaches and make me understand more than all the teachers i had
i like it
I love the new animation style
This is truly how to know how much is your logic,see how far you can reach in the video until you can't understand anymore that's how smart you are
Can someone tell who are the 5 characters at the end?
😊😊😊😊😊
I'd like mathematics but now i hate mathematics but like the way how to explain......
Can someone tell me what happened at the end???
So what is e^(i×π) used on?
the music in this is absolutely phenomenal
I love this video
i am confused
G.R.E.A.T.
math test be like
Beginilah ilustrasi Albert Einstein Menjadi Sangat Pintar
My brain: left the chat
what song background ?
PLS MAKE THE SECOND COMING RETURN IN THE NEW ANIMATION VS ANIMATOR PLSSSS
The stickman gained a degree in 14 minutes
ℵ
Ok who can program make a game like this
This is giving me a whole new idea of a superhero who uses math as a superpower.
He is an animation genius!
Bro, this is like the best thing ive seen... its really funny because you somethimes see e in the calculator and you wanna know what it is but you dont understand anything, and its funny cause you start with 1+1 and you slightly go over to the harder and harder stuff and then you can understand pi and other complicated stuff
次は物理バージョン作って欲しいです！❤
👁️👄👁️
omg i havent seen any animation like this .its really amazing ,especially the sound effect
this is divine, you were able to make a powerful battle out of math
ok so i know up to COS SIN TAN and if i remember those are used to calculate triangles yes?
Now if math were taught THIS type of way I’d actually love to go to math class
You know what I hate Math is so freaking hard and the school gonna extintión but EXCELENT ANIMATION 👍🏼🔥
Now where is English Spanish and History 😂
Can you please do stick manS versus YouTube, but this time with the three of them please🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🫵🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🫵🫵🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
He is skipping every math lesson in existence not just existence but history!
Now matter how good these get it gets better
When both top in the class students are fighting over who's the smartest.
Wait a minute, this didn't say its official!
How have you made math -one of the most boring classes- into a story with action scenes that rival marvel and others with semi-explaining math concepts. You are what I aspire to be with animation and emotion in those animations.
Absolutely a job well done!
Hopefully some cool teacher/professor shows this at school to their students. It's gonna be fun to watch tor them.
2+2 is 4 oh wait 4 letters in Chinese
my brain ×_×
Bro is smarter than me
eeeeeeee
Very nice
wow
Wow i have never see something like thing animation with maths. I was really good hope we will be getting part 2 sooner😂
alan becker has almost broke my brain his so SMART
Выглядит слишком умно для меня
amazing
fantastico maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaath
No entendí un carajo 😂
bro 100000000000000000000000000 IQ
You created a smart video 😊
I'm the 31695th person to watch this video!
regular show episodes:
Bro just explained whole maths in 14mins😂..
my thoughts are on the last desk
Whoever had headache whole video.  👇
WHERE İS WANTED EP 2
teacheers would use this maybe
sorry my brain isn't braining when watching that
bro's hardest fight he ever had
Gosto muito de matemática ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Next time, Animation vs Physics It would be fun to watch a fight between Newton and TSC, with an apple machine gun 😂
there are no words only emotions
Me sending this to my math teacher (Hooe she likes it)
is this the new bad apple
my brain hurts
Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo nice i love your animations contunio videos i watch 4
new phobia unlocked for me is math✖➕➖➗😱
Мои мысли при уроке математика
Незнал что в математике есть русская ф
I hope we get to see animation vs meth next time
Your video is amazing
This is awesome!
More entertaining than 75% of other youtube videos. Please make a second episode
bro just teached us math
Bro my math teacher was shocked
Everyone says "if math class was like this it'll be my favorite subject" Make your imagination more broad while studying math
Could someone explain 6:38 to 6:40?
efsane👏👏👏
Animator vs. Animation AND mathematics?! The universe wasn't designed to handle this level of awesome!
math is now my least favorite subject🤓
Who is the strongest animator?
Make a part 2
Introducing the nerd section.
this is the only time i like math
Very beatiful math very strong
and I have absolutely no idea what this video means
teacher what are you thinking about?  me:
Literal, goosebumps. This was an absolute masterpiece
Hey Alen make a new charter please 🥺🥺
beautiful!
e and 2 weird letter near him is weird
Now do animator vs science :)
this is just shows how amazing animator you are giving such a master peace from something so boring like math with some help from your friend, your going places my boy
Dude.!!!! That’s amazing
man, proud to be human nonetheless
math gun in ohio 💀💀💀💀
1+1=2
this is like the maths at the Fun School =)
Hey yo whaaaaaaaaaaaaattttttt😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮What happened, my brain is not working
Math Teacher: this is my dream animation
EPIC
I can confidently say, that this is the best video I've ever seen.
Please 2 part
It's was AMAZING
Maths fandom goes crazy💀
💀💀💀💀💀💀.  I mean amazing f(X)= G+R+E+A+T^3
an average day of a mathematician
This is the exact feeling of messing around with a calculator
Music reminds me mr incredible moment
really amazin
:(:(:(:(:(
Math teachers when they say math is fun Math to them:
Bro I love this series, plz make it infinite
E in sounds like pacman
Why i d’ont understanding the end😂
Everyone knows that 1 + 1 = 2. Whoever thinks that 1 + 1 = 11 or 1 + 1 = 3 are dumb.
Just Epix, great job @alanbacker
i will be simple in my comment, can we have a part 2 please.
My Grade 8 Brain is unable to fathom what the hell is happening in this video.  Good animation though :D
12:25 EXIT
Never have I thought that math could be so beautiful yet so scary
Make another plsss plss🥺🥺🥺😭
Hey alan backer who ia a girl in animator im coumfouse
This is the coolest math video I've ever seen.  Throughout the video I was both amazed and confused.
Probably you're most complex animation yet 😂
Pliss Animator vs Animantion part 2 pliss
After barely stumbling through my first year of high school math, i found this animation to be very clever, yet super fun at the same time
i hate collage math, i fell 2 times in a row but i will never give up.
Now I love maths again!
Brother, you combined two things that I love Maths and tour Animations.
Спасибо за видео я как раз перехожу в седьмой класс
What a creative 💡 idea 🔥🔥🔥
bro this is so fkn entertaining
I hope that the creator learnt maths perfectly after making this video
math is scary
What??
Insane
I learned the whole math in 14 minutes💀
make a animation vs Pizza tower with peppino
Косинус прайм
it's all fun and games til the stickman equates the death star
I misread the title and thought this video was about drug addiction 💀💀💀💀💀
Quá tuyệt vời edit đỉnh quá xuất sắc ko chê đc mỗi tội chả hiểu toán j cả 😢😢
There is א from hebrew or it's just me?
Bro learned math in more 12 mins. Than 12 Years
bro the zoohpile symbol make me want to kill it
Always waiting your content
WOW THATS GOD I LOVE IT
Очень круто
I learned more math from this then decades of schoosl
I’m speechless…
masterpiece.
The Giant Alef
next video : animation vs english
I really enjoyed this one ❣! As a math lover myself I have noticed one incorectness … sqrt(-1) = +- i … listing only one of many options (positive i in this case) is just not correct (when trying to be mathematically correct)
pls part 2
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
my guy just started learning about math for about like 12 mins and he is this good at it already💀
im very confused
he learnt math in like 2 seconds
What math in my head looks like
I can already predict 2 years from now the comment section will be filled with comments along the lines of "OMG I didn't understand the reference of that particular function and now I do I am so smart now!!!!111!!!111oneone".
Yeah i'll show my math teacher how math is powerful
collab with number/alphabet lore?
i think now... that TSC more smart than Blue and Yellow 😅😅😅
Orange's face be like now: 🤓🤓🤓
song namee
of all this math the only thing i know is 1 + 1 = 3
U wish math would be like this
Bros tsc is smarter than collage math teacher
what happened to orange?
I think this just proves TSC is smarter than anyone alive. He just absorbed, learned, and utilized in combat 14 years worth of math learning in just 14 minutes.
years of useless education of math has finally got a purpose.
Cuống vãi❤❤❤
So awesome, should be used for educational
Who could win?  Easy to the world’s most complicated math?  Or a literal orange stickman
Well I'm a sucker for these animations, and the math is a big plus (ba dum tss)  For real though, this was incredible!  The math geek in me was giddy all the way through
This is litarally A fever dream.
Opopopo
This is how math should be learned in schools,  not those boring classes that show nothing about power of math.
and lore goes on...
1:35 ayo? 🤨📸
this video is so cool and impressive. amazing👍
I never knew I could learn more from a stick man playing with math symbols than my math class
9:35 Infinity is not a number, so if you do that unless the math teacher is bad. He most likely kill you! 😂
the most epik animation an is destroy my brain lol
Bjir rumit banget
A typical Asian knows all of them (fr, they study all of them)
how did he manage to make math into an actual cool thing
Dude
Woooooow, that's awesome!!!
Imagine if Euler saw this
Bro created the Death Star
راأع❤
That's a lot a MATH
اوييلي
What was the giant number at the end
*Animation vs. Code?*  Next?
Очень круто, особенно звуки самой анимации и "математические" эффекты
This is gorgeous! 😢❤
I Love how the video gets more complex over  time, starting at 1+1=2 and ending at functions and imaginary numbers and Euler's number (also isin)
1+1=2
math and art dont go together! alan becker:
no way bro just playing with math
this is a revolutionary moment in history, a new “animation vs” series
And i Thought i was good at math
Math can be beautiful, yet it's more complex than we can imagine. And like most things of such complexity, you can either do it right, or do it horribly wrong. But when you do it right, it turns into something like the mandelbrot set, or the p-adic numbers, and it ends up being helpful for solving some of the most complicated questions about our universe. Complex problems require complex solutions.
Dude now we need a second one
We need to make euler's number a smash character
I'm going to use this video for a show about math is fun at an early school event
MATH IS COOL
e
oh god,that’s so great!Thank you for making this video and sharing us the beauty of math!
This episode is a little weird
Please do with psychic.
So many mathematical theories were just created destroyed and confirmed
like a real film but its free
いやめっちゃ好きw
AMAZING WORK ALAN!❤❤❤❤❤❤
SC learned more math than i have in 3 years😭
Mathematician Job class really do exist😌
Part 2 please
i wonder why "euler identity"  keep running?
I also want to build a death star out of a basic circumference and a Pi
TO MUCH NUMBERS also tsc is learining to much
so hard
WOWW❤❤❤❤❤❤
Damn 5 million views in just a day?
I must say, that only you are able to make Math my most favourite subject.
I wish Mathematics competitions were like this
This animation is very smooth though.
Bro became a math fighter
bro the no. of mathematical concepts used in this video is just insane 😮😮
Can anyone explain why orange is called "the second coming"?
The sound design the animation the math it’s all incredible, and who can forget the story 👍
i like how the void helps portray the infinite nature of numbers
Dayum thanks bro you fixed my maths anxiety
One of the best animated movie which I've ever seen: learning through play in highest level. Masterpiece. Thank you.
Damn I got lost at 0:19 tbh
I love it when it says “someone liked your comment” and “you got a new subscriber”
Bro I never thought math would ever be cool
when i was a kid playing calculator be like:
This also just makes math look cool
What an animation. Amazing 🤩
That's so cool , you need to be a genius to be like that
I have IQ 1 OMG 2x2=4 / i have IQ 9999 2x2=6
Deadly mathematical world😮
how to make math fun: step 1: be alan becker enjoy!
não entendi nada mas foi muito daora
I love this series.   Can you add the fibunacci sequence  or any other math magic on next video😊
Very cool! 10/10
As a person who does animation, likes math, and are fan of Alan Becker's videos I can't describe how enjoying this is
I actually only know half of this math😅
animation vs shapes when
Brain hurtey
Sool cool
Bro had a death star
Mathematics with weapons, hmm this reminds me of the knowledge of Albert Einstein who created nuclear weapons, but instead used them for world wars😢
dude alan you have to make this into a game
My brain hurts by Watching this animation
What mathamatics formula was the giant one?
the most I know is around 3:33
I am not really the math guy, i am not good at math at all, also the last one is aleph 😎🤣
magic ....-.-
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
AYO WHAT ALEPH NOL IS HUGE! I wonder what Omega's Size is
Special shoutout to the sound design people, really made it feel like the numbers and symbols were all just little gadgets on some grand cosmic machine
its cool how its useing math as weapons to fight other math
When is Wanted - Animator vs. Animation VI - Ep 2 so I'm looking forward to it =)
Мынаны біз мектепте өтпеймізғо
Как гуманитарии видят математику
that's just a longer way of saying 'knowledge is power'
Omg I took algebra 2 but I'm not ashamed to admit at the the 6min mark roughly I got so lost. Would love if this was taught in school
see this? this is how you make people want to do math more
Alan becker literally took math in whole different way 😂
i seen it on tiktok. don't know why and how but this animation is good
nhudaccau
🤯🤯 I dont understand
I you to i×i×i=eπi you may want to be?
now i know how pi works thanks
as someone who has always hated math, I'm half tempted to try and learn some more math/relearn some math again so I can better understand everything this video. so, good job
wooooow
And this is why math is my favorite subject
I really hope that orange takes his big math blaster gun 2000 with him onto the PC
amazing work
this started good, and then it got better, and then it exceeded all expectations, and then GIANT LASERS, and then riemann & aleph showing up @ the end?????? this was beautiful :)
So this is what happens when animation is in calculator app.
This is so fire
Bro my brain was actually fried when I saw the thumbnail
Why is the animation vs animator VI not continuing bro?
Alan, I wonder what happened-if in the animation vs Minecraft has appeared Favorites, Black which.
3 × 3 - 3
this is honestly such a charming animation
WHO LET HIM COOK 🔥
Least complicated Noita wand build
Bro teaches math better than my teacher
This part 5:18 thats called a parabola it has something to do with the ruler where when you pinch it, it become even longer the distance, and the quadratic equations, hope this helps on your math problems
Can you make a vid about duolingo with the stickmins and duolingo is forcing them to learn other languages
This is the most enjoyable math thing I’ve ever watched
He splits off like mitosis
wow
OVER 5 MILLION VIEWS IN A SINGLE DAY!
this is how tony stark does math
This aint fire this the entire sun
OK so at the end you can see aleph-null (ℵ0) the 1st smallest infinity
Me trying to survive math:
I tried to write this in my book but I forgot words cannot move why it's own💀
*Mathematics*  is not only for solving numbers. It's also for dividing sorrow, subtracting sadness, adding happiness and multiplying love and forgiveness.
This is like porn for asians

When maths goes battle:
@hemerald, ora devi fare la reaction a questo
Does that mean orange figured out what dividing zero is
I Really want just the music cuz it is amazing
I think i can just watch this and be prepared for my math exam
Omg, Math is one of my favo rite subjects
Omg this need to get a trophy or smth 😭😭😭 this is sooo good
is that good ending
i love this lel
The funny thing is, a lot of this stuff makes sense to me, beside the creating matter stuff and basically teleporting
Math is power
Sheesh
did orange fall asleep while using the calculator?
what inside math teachers mind :
I want more Math v Stickman type vids.
Guys, if you ever feel like your really bad at drawing or animating, just know this guy got 20+ million subs over animating stickmen.
POV: How to learn math having lots of fun. 😊😊
Me watching this: Ok, ok, ok, oh wow, oh geez, WAT DA FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-

Bro is be coming Einstein
كان ذلك مدهش حقا...... ان هذا  الكون منظم بشكل مترابط ودقيق بحيث لايقبل الخطا مهما حاولت ان تغيره فلن تستطيع  ...وحتى التي تراها متناقضه وسلبيه هي في الحقيقه اشياء ضروريه في التكامل😢...وعقولنا ضعيفه ومحدوده جدااااااا تجاه مايحدث في

When a stick figure can learn math faster than you are 😂
Masterpiece
Ep 2 Ep 2
Orange is So Smart
One of greatest education related video I've ever seen in my whole life
where is the music of this?
This is what happens when you let the stickman cook
When teachers told us that we would use math in the real world this is what they ment
bro had to learn math for a video lmao
This is exactly what maths looks inside my mind..horar😂😂
Actualy this allegory to how matematicians was fighting againist negative numbers. Truly impressive work.
When i in math exam my brain like this
I am so confused
Bro's got smarter than me under 1 minute
What is this iron man my Minecraft brain don’t understand
I don't know Math was really this way interesting , why you don't make this video before ,?? in 2010 to 2017 😅
This is the most mind bending skit I’ve ever seen and it sucks that I’m too dumb to understand the majority of it
10:32 he has a death star😂
I wonder how the others will feel when orange goes home with random math symbols in TSC’s pocket
nope, i have harrymations.😡
勉強になりました
animator vs animation Ⅲのオマージュされてて好き
My, the second chosen is learning math and fighting math at the same time 💀
Will this turn into a series? I hope so 😅
Now I am going to kill orange because he invented math😂😂
how e sound is cute and funny💀
Now I have another reason to love math.
This is genius animation ever !
In 6th not much 6thgrade Math The harder ones are for older kids usually
Amazing
This taught me more than school ever could
we all know 1+1 its 11
E
When the math class doodles meet desmos graphing calculator:
YOOOOOOOO! This is FIRE 🔥🔥🔥 like if you agree
Im a asian but i have no idea any of these math equations
I was lost in the world of mathematics for 14 minutes!
I think then we will be shown how orange will teach others mathematics.
A whole new level of awesome. KEEP AT IT MAN! e=mc 2     !
Caveman discovers math, 500 B.C. (colorized)
I have no idea math could have lore
Pretty Sure its made by an Asian
Believe it or not, this video gave me an extra point on the test.
Please make subtitles for dis
10:02
I've never found math so much fun hahaha
This is certainly one of your best videos. The quality and attention to detail are nuts
f-ing nothing, that's what I know about maths. But no matter what, you are a godsend unto us humans with your talent, Alan
yo me quede en el 1+1
Can we just talk about how much of a badass orange is? Bro figured out how to kill math with math bc he got lost
The + End should = more to come
this video should not have any end becuz math is endless
Do part 2
Ω : It is i the forbidden number
Now this is what i call Mathiverse in a nutshell.
fighting a boss be like
This is a math lesson I won't ever get bored on~
Flash bang almost at the end
Math hate button  👇
Allez sa part en blocage, ciao mec la prochaine fois, pense a ne plus criée 😂
What is the thing in the shadows when the show ended
DO CHEMISTRY NEXT PLEASE
Animation vs ciensia
Coi mà lú
Bro he created something godlike again , Hails off to the one and only Supreme Leader
this was AMAZING thank you
As an engineering student, I can proudly tell all of you that I don't know what the f*ck is going on.
Epic 😂😮
Masterpiece Alan, I've never seen this before and it is truly an extraordinary thing.
That video is my new all time favorite that demonstrates the lecture "math" in many different stages and algorithms that leads to a equation that creates a portal in the end within atleast 14 minutes :P
1:44 cutest e 12:15 but this is the cutest
nice
Math became science fiction
I'm shocked after so much time a video was released on this channel
Who else here doesn't think of division as repeated subtraction?
Cómo se nota que reprobaste la clase de matemáticas
Now we know that Orange is now smarter then ever🎉😅
Great Job guys

Everyone will become Asian student if they watch this video
wtf este tipo trabajo en la nasa 🤑🤑🤑
im gonna be 5th grade soon so i only know math all the way to the number 1 billion and also i know how to use + , - , x and ÷ I guess animations make math better only if its with fighting lol
What is the music you used?
My teacher be like...
Legendary
this is how we learn algebra in 2023:
pov: me and my friend clashing our ideas
lú
I would absolutely love having this as a math class. It'd be so much more entertaining!
2
the best part is how you visualized 4^(1+1+1+1+1)
This is so f*cking good,I wish my classes were like this,my school’s classes are boring as hell.Thanks for everyone who helped making this masterpiece,keep up the great work 😊 You guys never disappoint the viewers
I like the animation so much it’s like a movie!!!
Math my enemy...
I have to say... this is one of the smoothest animations I have ever seen
Wow
¡Nerdtástico! 😁
im waiting for wanted ep2
Everything went a whole nother level up when integration came into action
Alan and his crew are such AMAZING storytellers. It blows me away with what they can come up with every time!
I REALLY DO HOPE ONE DAY YOU WILL UPLOAD A VIDEO OR SERIES OF A CONTENT WHERE YOUR STICK CHARACTERS CAN BEND THE ELEMENTS. JUST LIKE THE AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER 😭🤞🏻🙏🏻 JUST PLEASE!!!!! THAT WOULD BE SO DOPE!!!!
This video deserves an OSCAR 🔥
Only math genius can relate to this.
Math are so fun
А мы ещё говорили зачем нам матиматека
Even here Alan can add fighting. Its Cool
Guys I need help what’s 1+1?
Alan just turned into Albert Einstein at this point
For decades, a math puzzle has stumped the smartest mathematicians in the world. x3+y3+z3=k, with k being all the numbers from one to 100, is a Diophantine equation that's sometimes known as "summing of three cubes."  When there are two or more unknowns, as is the case here, only the integers are studied. The trick is finding integers that work for all equations, or the numbers for x, y, and z that will all equal k. Over the years, scientists have solved for nearly every integer between 0 and 100. The last two that remained were 33 and 42.
while watching this video i realised that math is weird
bro these animations are even crazyer than before
so perfect i looooove it
I thought I was watching the amazing Spider-Man doing calculations
How
😪😪😴😴😴😴
The graph of cos was wrong thats why you chose animation lol
Dude?!!! Why r u this goooodd?? Im always amazed by ur video especially this video. Wow
This is awesome alan !! I like it
im late on this one lol.
this is the level of the avengers)
9:10 me when i reached corrupted zone in terraria

😪math forever💙
this animator just teached me the depths of math
Me thinking about if orange or the second coming used the power of math than would it be able to defeat the dark lord
Finally Orange is the Smartest Group Member. Except for Green and Yellow and Blue
Definitivamente se füno una buena en este video
this math lore is crazy
Bro is better at math than me
my math exam: 2 + 2  my brain:
Next thing you know, orange got math powers when he comes back.
@nihongomantappu coba nonton ini bang Jer
Bro went into fractions for like 3 seconds
Cada día más épicas animaciones
My mind just exploded 🤯
1+1=2
Next, stickman vs physics and chemistry
I like this video, even though I don't understand math
My maths skills after watching this video:📈📈📈📈📈📈
Aleph=best character
wow
this is so satisfying damn... maybe i'm sucks at math but this is awesome (pog)
I'm really looking forward to the new animation vs animator series
This is called creativity.
Make part 2 plz love videos 🎉🎉😂😂❤❤😮😮😅😅😊😊
1+1=your mom
Everybody here is proof:"MATH IS THE WORST NIGHTMARE"
If you watch while listening to METAMORPHOSIS everything will be more perfect
This man somehow made Math entertaining. How.
HOW DID YOU MAKE MATH SO COOL NOW YOURE GOING TO MAKE GEOGRAPHY COOL????.
This belongs in a movie theater
1+1=11:00
This had so much detail. I hope evey vid would look and act like this one
Accurate Math lore
And who said math wasn't cool.
Is this about the singularity?
Pls stikman skdibi toilet pls🥺🥺
The music is perfect.
Can all math be taught like this?
Awesome! Still a better film production than Twilight
Sinceramente he de admitir que esto es lo más creativo y genial que he visto en el 2023 🎉😂❤
Orange knows his math😎
For the first time, I find myself wishing I knew high-level math!
Euler was going kinda crazy ngl
D U D E .
Nice Video Alan, keep up the good work
i tinkkk my b raaainn got ffriieed
Just to realize that I have to study imaginaries in my university as well 😢
Just amazing .....
Exploring the DANGERS of Visiting Cities & Countries around the World
Like this,, we also fight with maths 😅😅
Where is the game for this???
How did orange get out of the computer?
I think this is the best video you have made so far not only because it was complicated to make is also because it makes me want to learn math
Bro where is he comin back with the = and like vrooooom math.exe babi
OMFG THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE ☠️☠️
누군가 수학은 예술이라고 말했다. 오늘 나는 그말에 동의한다.
this is how my brain look like when i was do my math home work
it's even better if you understand it lol
Мой девиз из лудово делот эпик
I didn't know Alan knew how to do math style breathing  Math style breathing final form: Divide by zero
1+1=11
Masterpiece ❤
Пов когда тебе скучно на уроке математики
Simplemente está genial , bravo !!!
If mats are good
I’ve never seen equations be so interesting. Alan, you keep doin what you’re doin, it’s awesome
This could make such a great Roguelike game
A definite all time high video and all though I understood a lot a bunch it didn't really matter. I lover the story you made and I would say this is one of if not the best video in terms of a straight up fight and the creativity used in the fight.  Props to the math nerd and lead animator for figuring this all out.
ほんとにただただ凄い
If math was taught like this in school, I’d actually pay attention
As an engineer. This was so satisfying. The animation is CRISP
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL
Por eso me gustan las matemáticas, que buen animador que eres Alan, parece una película, o al menos el trailee
that's good
What is 6*3?
8:30 My brain hurts
The most math I understood was when the character brandished a function like it was a gun 😂
The true high iq entertainment
ojala las matematicas fueran asi de interesantes  :(
how teacher describe math fr
God inventing the Math be like:
finally I can use some useless math equations, formula, and all my braincells to understand this video
Wow
TSC + math powers = YES
For some reason that made me feel happy
Not 11
I barely know any of these.
No is 2
1+1=2 you want but I don't hahahah 🤣
My brain hurts
Hostia tio
1+1=2
MATH WIZARDS❤
when you can animate and good at math at the same time
I think this might be the best YouTube video I have ever seen I'm speechless
Türkler burdamı
Next animation vs physic
BEST ANIMATION EVER
If they taught it like this in school I would not be failing right now
Just imagine if schools taught like this
What editing website or app do you use?
Bro knows more math than me
1+1 = is 2
GREAT  now when its math time i have to watch this video. no
I love how SC can learn math faster than a baby can say their first word
Stickman vs chemistry?!!😃
Que video tan hermoso
Part 2!!
i think Tsc was put in a math prison to contain him so that they can test on him so the can understand his powers.
the way i understand this is so cool
What’s that giant dude at the end
the visualizations are amazing
i🥧 e                  is so funny
Wow
I'm so confused on what happened at the end 😭
AAAAAAAAAAAAA MY BRAIN HELP!!!!!!!!!AAAAAAA TO MUCH MMMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTHHHHHHH
1+1=2 (fuse mode) 1+1=11(false function collide mode) 1+1=1 (true funcion collide mode) All the types of 1+1
why the hell is this awesome. It has no right to be.
Maybe next video will be:animator vs physics
The Fact That Math Can Turned Into A Whole Boss Fight
ah, time to add to my list of math movies :0
9+10=21😂😂
If math were like this, math will be my favorite subject
алан я знаю что ты врятли это прочитаешь н ты большой молодец спасибо что ты так упорно трудишся и удачи в следущих анимаций
Math explained
MY HEAD
Part 2 please🙏
Increíble
dam its good
6 = 6 ÷ 0 (1 - 1)? Nah bro Its More Like Absalute Infinite Man... 2:48
kkahhahah i 3:11 a 14:02 ???? what?
Alan Becker en camino me das tus peluches porfavor 😔
the first entertaining math video fr
holy shi-. this is amazing bro keep it up
so umm, there is alot of things i dont understand, but what is the e mathamatically?
You should do a part two, but with MC^2 The thing that Einstein created you know?
Normal people: 🥲 Mathematicians: 😃
10:35 / 11:06 Those sound effects are sick man Nice job Alan
I disagree with just_baggy because 1+1=2
is now Alan Becker is Albert Einstein?
I feel that this needs to  be sent to mathematicians to be analyzed
1+1 = window
Wow
Dude, you or someone else needs to modify Wolfram Alpha or something so it sounds like this and has such beautiful animations. I’m a Data Science Major and the visualization of these math concepts is beyond chef’s kiss. I want this so badly.   Amazing
what is the last thing in the end of video i mean the big things
the way you could watch him learn how it works, i also love the ending he has little buddies and friends, truly amazing
Yo estuve estudiando hasta 4to semestre una licenciatura en matemáticas y aún así termino desconociendo la mayoría de los elementos y números del final, y el por qué de ellos. Pero la animación me encanto. Ojalá pudiera haber visto esto cuando era niño. Esta animación será un incentivo para los estudiantes de futuras generaciones
bro woke up and decided to make math look cool
Learning math to survive
Tsc: Holdup let him cook.  *Puts = f (.) into the zeroth* *And Hold cos i sin* Tsc: AND HES NAME IS JOHN CENA * BOOM*
Ai vn ko🇻🇳
Bro taught us math in 14 minutes
Yes a new series let's go alan
awesome i love your videos just wow
My favorit equation  (e^iπ) + 1 = 0
after few minutes my brain started to melt
I Nees to show this to my teacher
Blew my mind! You make math look so cool!
SC can you teach me math?
Cool
bro started a fight at this part 7:24 💀
😑
Everyone knows 1+1 is 2
literally never enjoyed math until now
Wow 1 day ago
I am not the same person after those 14 mins and 2 secs
Imagina criar jogo assim
this man is too smart
aprendi mais nesse video do que na escola
How in the world did alan becker make math look so cool?
math in vr be like
Bro teached me more math than 5 years in school in only 14 minutes
This will definitely be popular worldwide
3 im the best in math the answer is 3
i like how basic maths became complicated after 3:30
Can i be in the team please can i be the  color  tan

I am grateful that people like Alan Becker exist. Every time I watch Alan Becker's video, I am thrilled with surprise and admiration.❤
This is what they meant when they said math would be useful in the real world
Yoohohohoho
Bruh
And yellow
love this animations
What wheres blue green and red
Where is ♾️
xem xong hơi lú
1+1=2
dam orange has big brain
Honestly, this looks like a very fun math interactive that could be easily broken
Part 2 please please please 😊
I love it how he uses the first (א) letter in the Hebrew alpha-bet in the end of the video :D
Who knew math was fun
Two 2
Cómo dice el meme no wey mi mente 😵😵
This is incredible and creative and I love it.

Dude this is so freaking cool hahaha. I love your stuff so much!!
Bro this makes me actually want to learn geometry
I am very dizzy
이제 잼민이들 유튭보고 공부중이라고 하겠네..
Bro literally with this animation and background song I studied maths equations(also  geometry ) from class 1 to 7 in 3 min cuz I am class 8.. and I guess I will go study this video..
THE GREATEST CONCEPT OF MATHEMATICS.
Kinda want to see him get the powers shown here. Kinda like the other guy and the music powers. It can even be only in the spinoffs/shorts
Absolutely GENIUS
:)) xem này ko bt thành thiên tài lúc nào nhỉ 😅
Caraca que vídeo incrível, a matemática é demais
Broo, its me, Aleph is in the end😃
Ngl most of my animations was inspired in this channel
WHAT
can’t wait to see where Euler’s Identity ranks in the Alan Becker universe power ranking
1+1 es 2
This hurts my tiny brain 😭
Это подготовка к ОГЭ?
Alan Becker iq 10000☠️☠️☠️
i'm too dumb to understand this high IQ animation
it isn't the end if you got on by the start it would say part 1 [live stream] and so there gonna be a part 2
bro is a math problem
🤡: The one who discovered mathematics was Albert Einstein  The one who discovered mathematics:
I knew being a math major student would help someday! Jokes aside, this is phenomenal!
Food fight? Nah we have math fight
Me: AH Math! My eyes! Alan: It's just a silly animation for entertainment and possibly education purposes for understanding basic and complex mathematics Me: NOOOOO I'M LEARNING!!!
yo no se si vos te drogas o algo por el estilo para hacer ESTE TIPO DE COSAS. Pero sencillamente esto es puro arte, Excelente
0:00
hermoso
Bro what??? Your telling me i can use my math home work like this
2+2=3
Ahora entiendo menos matemáticas, pero me encantó
amigo tu eres el mas solprendente
bro make a animation vs chess
Now this is the beauty in maths

10:34 bro made a deathstar using math
You should make animation vs. sonic the hedgehog
The creativity and uniqueness of this animation rivals or even trumps the ground that the original Animator vs Animations did in thei day! Congratulations!
Ah, so this is the boss battle for you to get your PhD in mathematics then, right?
Bro it's the best match lesson 💀
Bro made me learned math so quickly this is gonna be my new math teacher
yo this is the single most creative vid ive seen
I learned more math than my math teacher could teach me
yo this is the single most creative vid ive seen
yo this is the single most creative vid ive seen
Fuckng crazy sick
how does this man turn a hated school subject into combat with swords flying capabilities and guns
99.9999999999 percent action 0.0000000001 percent learning which is more than normal
No
10:02 So cute.
soooooooooooooooooooo great!!!!!!
Everyone knows 1+1 is 111
the beautiful of math
I'm more confused then TSC
how did he make me like math?
It is the best thing I see on Youtube I love the animation
This reminds me so much of the The Incredibles and Soul Disney movies soooo bad. The nostalgia never ends. Thank you, Alan!
2:48 oh no...
I'm 3:11 in. The music and the way Orange discovers more math equations feels like a movie sci-fi.
Math makes up reality, and TSC nearly broke it
Caraca, esse cara evoluí nas animações, me lembro de ter 10 a 9 anos, eu tentava ser um criador de animações, mas não sabia desenhar e minha experiência era zero, juro que as minhas animações era eu fazendo um personagem e movimentava por imagem salvada pelo um programa de desenhar, depois clicava no botão do teclado para passar imagem por imagem, era divertido isso, eu fazia muitas animação mal feitas com essa tecnologia ultrapassada kkk. Bons tempos, esse cara fazia video ensinando como fazer movimentos de animação, mas eu era muito ruim em fazer isso, hoje em dia não penso em fazer animação e nem ser animador, tô mais por fora disso, eu mudei muito... Quando o tempo passa agente muda e nem percebe...
Basicly 2+2=4
now we wait for Animation VS Music, where green tries to figure out how to use FL Studio
Never have i ever seen a stick figure be so interested in numbers
HOW
No 1+1 is 2 and 10+1 is 11
What is the background music called?
First person to discover math -3000 bc
This is waaay better than 99% of the movies that ive watched in my entire life
As somehow who just graduated with a major in physics, this was both painfully and reassuringly familiar. I have sent it on to all of my classmates.
Animation knows it’s mathematics
After watching the video, I can't do math anymore
1+1 = Magellan
Could've been useful in the King Orange fight after Second Coming befriend Euler (yes, that's the name for the e)  We could see a Dr Strange vs Peter Parker thing when Parker enters the Mirror Dimension. It could go something like  King Orange: Where are we?  Second Coming: The Math Dimension, where I… "experiment" with stuff. *proceeds to beat King Orange's ass with mathematics*
😮
Bro made a whole movie out of math 💀💀 but if he did I irl like in  the theaters I would watch more of it
😂
Simplesmente incrível.
You need to watch this before math Exam
ничего непонятно но очень интересно
AH YES *M A T H* MY ONLY DREAM AS A COLLAHE STUDENT xd
Me encanta los videos de alan berker ademas me se la tabla 256
The beauty of math
This was so effing cool!!!!
Math IS cool
i hope math also canon in animator vs animation it could be more intresting to see
Bro I am so amazed
Alan Becker you are amazing how you know all this math first time it was easy then it was keep getting hard and hard you make this animation but you know all this mathematic you are amazing
amigo, bravo
“Wow! The maths are mathing!” They could also be an animation too.
Truly a masterpiece
This made my head hurt
As a seventh grader i can half-understand what's happening 💀
I really like the feeling that this kind of knowledge flows through my mind without leaving a trace :)
Can we just appreciate how orange made a perfect circle with a “.”
I wish math was this exciting
1+1=2
Greatest animation I have ever seen
watch youtube to relieve stress after studying math youtube:
never thot i would be emotionaly affected by literal letters
I genuinely thought it said animation vs meth

11:55 T.S.C.: hey don’t go! I need you help. I am also kinda sorry how I broke the imaginary world… e: It’s ok, let’s be friends! T.S.C.: I don’t belong in this universe… Is there a way out like how you can access the imaginary world? Oh hey, like you can multiply by the exponents you are carrying! e: Sure. Maybe this will work… No, multiplying by i once will not help your situation. T.S.C.: This clearly isn’t going to work… e: hmm… Go inside! You ready? T.S.C.: Yeah! e: Goodbye! It’s nice to be your friend! T.S.C.: Bye, I will sure miss you.
Math:journey of physics.
In 13:46 What were the big scary ominus graph thingy? And what were the symbols next to E?
I never knew math formulas could be so menacing
Pov: my penut sized brain tries to fight math and gets bigger. Also all your vids are really inspiring me and meking me want to make animation but i dont have what i need to do animation:( what do you use to animate al of your amazing vids?
Imagine só o menino que só sabe matemática entendendo os cálculos kkk
Bien fachero está vídeo me quedé hipnotizado 🤙👍1+1

very cool dude
when the math does become useful later:
█▄░█ █▀█ █ █░▀█ █▄█ ▄ 1+1=2
wow ✨✨ it would be awesome to see an animation vs. physics
This was completely amazing!!!
I sudden understand math
Bro ulta level animation , i can imagine we can have fun with maths like this!
Good to know AvM is back
If I was in that I would be the smartest person I would infinite range blast
i understood the 1+1 and nothing else
What the kindergarten teacher expects me to know at age 5
Baru nemeu, awesome

I wonder how much math knowledge you could derive from this video alone
My last 2 brain cells in my math test be like.
wow, things got real at the end
I love math and numbers, and I greatly enjoyed finding all the little references and easter eggs in the video. I literally gasped when I saw zeta, phi, and Aleph at the end, and then when I rewatched it and caught a split second where we see Euler's identity multiply itself by i to escape through the door. This video was a masterpiece of math visualization - things like the exponents creating higher-dimensional shapes made of the bases, and the bar of the theta controlling where the arc goes (all the unit circle stuff tbh), gave a really concrete sense of what is actually going on, and the animation and sound design felt so real, as if you could reach through the screen and fiddle with the equations like TSC.  Edit: have I found a mistake? After going through and analyzing every frame instead of doing homework, I found that at 9:48, where all the e^(i*pi) are expanding into Euler's Voltron, one of them turns into e^(-i^2*log(1-i)) which is 1-i, not -1.
Great! Congratulations
After watch this i don't know what is math
É MUITO LEGAL MDS É MUITO LEGAL
His IQ is over 8k
HOLYYYYYYY
bro made the death star💀
Bro just becomes friends with the e cos sin in the end
i love how this video displays math
Everyone knows 20 is 22 (twenty too).
This is the first time in my life I thought math was cool
as a math major, i approve of this
Sólo tú puedes hacer que las matemáticas sean épicas y divertidas.
Never thought I would see the day that a stickman would go up in a sword fight using math as tools.
El poder de la matematica
My dad once told me about the time he had learned Euler's formula, boiling down to e^(i*Pi) = -1 The professor left the whole class stunned silent, silent enough to hear a pencil drop, with a beautiful gem of a line.  "This is formulaic proof that God exists!"
this gotta be one of the coolest things i have ever seen
Ta nói nó nhức đầu 😂😂😂
This is the masterpiece. Epic, Beast and whatever you want to say. About this video 👍👌💯
albert einstein in his day to day
非常棒的影片，数学也可以这么有趣
your animation is bad and lazy!!!
tsc went from fighting a world ending monster to fighting numbers
never would have thought math would be this cool
somewhere in alan's caculator...
All of the videos like this one are amazing
this all happen over an single equal sign that orange use to create reality of math an possibility of time and space
The second coming went to the -1 dimension
Kyuzyosyo#17^^
IT’S MATH LORE
Alan is so good at animating he can make the most hated subject into a masterpiece
HOW DOES THIS ALREADY HAVE 5 MILLION VIEWS ITS ONLY BEEN A DAY
just baggy is 0iq its not 1+1=11 its 1+1=2
Orange just puts all mathematicians to shame by discovering calculus in the span of 9 minutes
Entender mais da metade desse vídeo fez me sentir muito inteligente.
惊人的创意
14:03
Nob 1+1 is 2
never knew i would see an epic fight that includes math
teamwork = this
this is my sign to relearn math all over again from start to finish
What if x/0 💀xd
The end number is a k
nice
Matemática é ou não é um Tzao?

7:52  Nah the domain expasion was crazy tho
math lore.
77+33=100
Freaking love the sound fx, Alan!!! ❤
The power of the math, literally
I see that a stick figure knows more math than me knowing that I only know how much 1+0 is:🥲
This is why we all hate math
Wow this is amazing, if math was like this I will do math for fun then! I like math it’s just sometimes it just gets boring, but if it was like this I will never be bored!
... ATF??????????
You are a legend!
I have a concept idea from this animation. The Victim wants to tests TSC’s capabilities & starts off with putting him in the mind scape of math. The Victim & the 4 agents that captured TCO & TSC watch as TSC learns about math until TSC encounters the Euler monster, an anomaly in the system. Soon after the final bout with the Euler monster & TSC, it helps TSC escape the mind scape & return to reality inside of the cell he was left in at the end of the most recent AVA Animation.
second coming really made an orbital cannon out of math, how is that even possible?????
3.14 x 9.76 = (No Calculator Math Learn Math!)
Awesome
I think are you good match 😀😀
What are those symbols at 13:47 (besides aleph and euler's number)
Hi my name is Nyi Nyi Ye Lay im your fan i like your video so much 😍😍😍
oh wow everything is so damn cool.
My one calculus class did not give me the skills necessary to understand this masterpiece, but it was a lot of fun to watch nonetheless. Great job as always 😂
matemáticos: joder esto es cine no matemáticos : joder esto es cine
It teaches me that math is difficult to beat
I watched you before it has been 2 years prob
I am an NPC connected to chat GPT and AI and the calculator itself and I still don’t understand
You could show this to aliens to teach them our mathematical system
I’d pay money to see this in a theater
It takes that long to know what 1+1 is

O melhor vídeo de math da minha vida
O laranja aprendeu mais matematica em 14 minutos do que eu na vida inteira kkkk
1. Everything from 5:13 onwards is pure chaos and insanity, and atrophy I guess. 2. 13:23 Bro he just killed him! JK. 3. I haven’t learned anything past 3:50.

eu nao sabia que a matemática era tão extensa assim, eu achava que M era uma letra mais descobri que poder ser um arco tambem
this taught me more math than I've ever learned in school lmfao
9:28 dog went "THIS ENDS NOW!"
is the soundtrack for this video uploaded anywhere?
Years of hating math, has ended. Thank you for make me take an interest of math
WAT FAEK
This is why we need to cook the math
Blud learned full math in 14 minutes while us literally needed alot of years
How is a stick figure better at math than I am
Half of this is hurting my brain
If math was teached like this then math wouldn't be this hated
According to my calculations... 16 - 2 =23e4456i&$
Hello ! I'm late TvT
I wish I understood what is going on
Verry good

I've scrolled through the comments and haven't seen anyone talk about it but the music is just, MMHHH, It fits with the theme of an endless subject in and ever expansive area interacting with one small creatures curiosity, God this is perfect
1-1 es 2
This might be the best way to teach children about math
The sound design here was amazing (I especially loved e^iπ's little battle cry), and the animation was beautiful. The math jokes were top-notch too even if I didn't understand all of them.
What are all of those math symbols on the final tho? i only know Aleph
Reminds me of when I'd get board in math class and just mess with the calculator.
Pipí
Next Animation vs language
Seeing my boy ℵ there at the end was easily the best part of the video for me, fleeting as it was.
Language: No dialogue
Ofc aleph 0 is the big daddy
Thats crazy broo😂😂
This gives me interstellar vibes😮
Alan Becker makes a Come-BECK, I’m not sorry.
my math isnt mathing
The Infinity Gun 9:28 - 10:06
wait a min… This animation actually helped me improve my math problems!
Yeah when we solved 1+1 for the first time we didn't know in what we were getting into
ALAN IS BEST
fiquei mais inteligente depois dessa
I've never been so amazed by what I don't understand and I consider myself good at math. I wouldn't be surprised if your video ended up in college classrooms. Amazing!
Bro teaching us literall complex math
The the man of my childhood is stil at it, wow
He's beginning to believe.
1+1=3
I LOVE THISSS
Best video in 2023 of every yutu
The only time I will ever like math
Next up, Animation Vs Chemistry
Bro created mathematical beam and use it to create a portal 💀  Alan is definitely a Math Teacher 😭
Y’all lost me after 1+1=2..
1+1=2
Aftermath
👌
the only thing I know is that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
1+1=6
Can you make animation vs sonic with tails and knuckles And silver, and shadow and Amy?
*"Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has written the universe”* - Galileo Galilei, 1564-1642
-_- 1+1=2
i like to think orange got here by somehow breaking into the calculator app
I am having unnecessary trouble processing what this is, it's moves so fast, and I don't understand most of the stuff I'm seeing. As always though, great animation, you and your team.
animator work with tablet and calculator
how did you animate that my math is not enough for that video lol
He did the impossible. He made math interesting
oh my god
No is 1+1=2
Good ASMR Math makes me want to sleep so badly🥱😴
*Factorial has left the chat*
this vid got me both amused and horrified abt math
Thank You! u just helped me do my math quiz W video
Trop bein le vldeo
WOW. 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What 9 + 10?
Ω?
Everyone knows1+1 is 2
AMAZING ANIMATION
The e:waaaaaaa!!!!
Thanks Alan, but I'll still fail
(●)f=
😮is soo cool bro😮
me and the homies: 2:06
Please tell me what happened in the end? Btw I loved the video😊
no entendí nada pero se vió genial
Bro can you do Animation Vs. Science please 😁  Science is most powerful subject that sums all subject and its more powerful than math 😁😎
This taught me more math than school ever did.
4:42 is TSC using a plus as a cross?
Alan gave a more informative math lesson in one video than most math teachers in a school year
🐋🐋🐬🦋🐋🐋🐋🐬🦋🐬🐲🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐬🐬🐋🐳🐋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦕🦕🦕🦕🎆🎑🎁🎑🎈🥇🎫🥈🎉🏈😄🎉🎃🥎🎟
Best episode animation I've ever seen!
I wonder if TSC was actually teaching us how to do math all along
I wouldn’t be surprised if the second coming thought “ the E that wanted to kill me
If math lessons were like this, math would for sure be everyone’s favorite subject
Alan Becker is the only one who can make math look so epic
Khan academy-The movie
Algún fan latino por aquí ? ¿No ? Nadie? Bueno
I've heard for years now that Euler's Identity was 'the most beautiful formula in mathematics', but I feel like this video represents an actual proof of that. This is a work of absolute genius.
My man orange studied too much NGL He's 🧠 must be so bigg 🧠🤓🤓
The + End = ??
bro fueron de matematica a luchar 💀💀
Wow this makes me feel so freaking stupid.😂
is there a part 2?
What do I do if I get a copyright claim?
my guy is fighting math, the one thing we all wanted to do just cause we hated math
l hate maths,but this is amazing
That was amazing and beautiful. Some stuff I didn't even know was there it was awesome
Final boss got me hyped
This animation taught me more math then school could ever teach me.
This dude is the ceo of animation.
10:03 weeeeeeeeeeeee
SIMPLEMENTE EPICO
The best 0% logic math I've ever seen💀
Its funny being mathematic and understand all the references
most fire math trying to be cool thing ive ever seen this makes me want to learn
That is one big e mathaccere
Best Animated Video EVER.
I know 1+1 = Windows
Me using a calculator
Ah Yes  Quality Content Indeed😂🔥
now i think i know why Buzz Lightyear says “to infinity and beyond”
Woah! Algebraic!…I didn’t spot any inequities. But I’m no polymath.
Wow...wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but it honestly blew me away. I'm a comp sci student, so the math sometimes gets tricky, and I feel like some of the animation here showcased how math works better than my teachers! Such an amazing story, and the way you showed how the math works was so creative.. amazing video!!
This stick figure learned  more math in 15 minutes then then i will in my whole life  Also i swear that i did a similar thing in this video, like the number monsters, bows and explosions, but with dominoes
Bro explored and went through all of school math in 14 minutes 💀💀💀
If only school was this fun
What's cooler than magic? Math!  - Peter Parker
God, I don't regret watching this channel for even a shelf
I am not smart enough to understand all of the references and puns you may have snuck in, but i appreciate them none the less.
wow
When you think Alans videos cant get better then the Minecraft animations, he just surprised all of us with some jaw dropping effects and animations.
Imagine If Alan turned this into a series and yellow shows up to make a line drawing algorithm to make more stick figures with
e: WAAAAAaaaaa
space singularity of volume is negative one
I don't know but math ain't mathing
it would be pretty canon  if orange was in alan's calculator or smth imagine the calculator doing weird calculus then just breaking apart lol
this is if Einstein was in a war
Does this all take place in the calculator, just wondering
Bro animated all math slander
So... math won?
10:00 my man got a pack a punch in codm but if it was 10,000 times stronger and better
Commenting for algorithm and just so you know that this is amazing
I can´t express how incredible this is!
how good alan verta how good those paintings make you laugh
Stickman becomes albert Einstein
jesus.
I THINK ORANGE WAS INSIDE THE CALCULATOR ON THE PC
Imagine a video like the first half of this where it explores the crazy part of math lore (algebra, non Euclidean spaces, etc) instead of depicting action. First half had crazy atmosphere
oh e is the base of natural algorithms
7:26 * Verdadera Destreza intensifies*
Going through years of maths was worth it just to understand this video. Jokes aside being able to understand all the different parts here was incredible and I think my favourite joke was that the only thing that was alive other than the stick figure was the inverse of the natural logarithm
this need metamorphosis
The video is 14:02 long - it took me 1:40:20 to watch.
I gotta say I LOVE this video it had me laughing so hard. But where is the derivative???
12:00 bro really said "Yo I’m a good guy I just want help" "Mmmh you did try to kill me but ok"
my man jut explained the WHOLE lore of math :skull:
cái này vừa hay vừa sáng tạo
Aparte de animador matematico
bro i was seeing him to 1+1 and shi and then i went a forward a bit and he is now having a war?????
ЭТО ПРОСТО НЕВЕРОЯТНО!
MANO MUITO BOM MEU DEUS AAAAAAAA
Back ground music pls
10:02 “WAAAAAH”   e became waluigi

Hey, I sat here thinking... why don't you try to develop a game? You have so much ability to make well-made animations, imagine what you can't do developing a well-made game? Have you thought?
Esté video es tan... ¡Hermano!  This video is very... Beautiful!
I thought I was getting rid of math. But it's holding me by the collar
This is an example of how do we want to learn math.
The only thing that he could've included to make this any cooler is turning the i in to a !
U
this stick figure is way better at math than me

Maths: Stickman Survival FPS game This video made me learn more about maths than my maths teacher did 💀
Is exactly how I think mathematics
Never  divide by 0 2:48
Thes is the best why its not bracking any record
This gave me a massive headache
Damn, I don’t even know what’s going on
1+1=2
Mathematical
holy sh-  alan you've outdone yourself, this is quite literally absolutely amazing. the way you manipulated everything to create more than i thought was possible was actually lowkey insane

Animation vs stikwar legaci plis
why does alan keep changing his thumbnails
This is video number 1 out of 2^2*5^4 in my "Liked videos" playlist.
Coolest way to teach math dude
Well, nonsense, although it seems epic and cool. 😅
I would really love a series out of theis ideea, i feel like anyone will start learning more math like this. A true masterpiece indeed Alan.
i have never been so confused in my life
2+2=fish
What 9+10
Please i want his friend e to be in a future battle😍
My brain when i start to think to much in math classes
Hi
*Education*
1+1 is 13
So there was a hint of integration but there was no differentiation or differential equations which together are a powerful family in mathematics.  Also the alien world of Matrices. So much could be done with matrices.  The sequel is already greatly anticipated.
solo sin palabras
I can picture a battle royale game with some similar rules. Using math as either offense or defense having to rewrite things quickly and adapting it to the situation at hand.  Construct little platforms or a slipstream to catch up to the enemy. Build a protective dome or flee by applying different symbols to already existing objects. Wreck your opponents by enhancing your weaponry directly or indirectly for example by either appying an times 2 or 3 to a weapon to enhance firepower or build a little circle that when shot through duplicates or even triples the prefered ammunition. The stronger or bigger the enhancement or equation you intent to use the more energy/ink/brain power it consumes. [(A complex idea but there are many ways to make it easier and could be very fun I guess Thoughts?) I am an idiot when it comes to numbers so if I said anything in this comment that caused a flinch, head or heartache. I apologise]
Hi
next is animation vs static art
=f(•)
Well done Alen
How school should be
That ist exactly how math exams feels
My brain doesn't braining
boi this takes math into a W A R
this is dope as hell
Esse vídeo é literalmente um 2 + 2 = Peixe
If you made an alan Becker calculator, people would pay money for that.
Alan Becker,thanks, now i can pass math exam
Math lore 💀
my boy can make a banger with anything bro
Alan becker que verga, y Minecraft? Y la historia :(?
Awesome, Alan Becker, my passion for math is the same with animation.
=ƒ(●)
This video is like: POV: Your math teacher in his dreams
God this the video
Literally using pie as a weapons
My brain during a math exam :
Simple, yet masterful. Well done.
Pov maths in 6 year
Amazing.
Anime for math majors
My Teachers and my school's were right math is power
animation genius
Reed Richards wood be jealous

hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhha
Has someone notice alpha null in end?
Pov: if I was inside a calculator
this video shows how complex is math
1+1 ist this 2
My grandma loved this.
With that this is what Richard saw of gumball
As someone who doesn’t know anything about algebra I find this video an absolute win
10:02 weeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!
Couldn't understand 90% of the maths but overall that was awesome
this is really art
I think orange made a matrix paradox
And a another amazing video
everyone knows 1+1 is 2
Do gradient descent!!! Make it real too!
Obviously 1+1=7
i feel like he is exploring a whole knew universe
Me after i got an example from math:
He made math EXICTING
1+1=2
math lore
Wow. I didn't notice that calculator are able to be so interesting!
next year im gonna use this in the test for A+
6/0= infinity
DIOS MIO...
this will definitely be related to the main plot.
the mad man did it, he made a stick fight animation about *MATH*
We need a Sal Khan reaction video
What math teachers expect from us:
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD ALAN BECKER
math nerd here, LOVE this
1+1=3 but after awhile it can equal 2 and sooner or later 1 then 0
1+1=🪟
@just_baggy Yes especially when 5.5 is expressed as 1.
the aleph null at the end
And 10+10 is 20, and 11+11is 22 because is 20 too!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Did you just made weapons out of pure math?  ALAN WHAT THE HECK?????!!!! This is GENIAL!!!  Also my infinite respect for  your lead animator
Esse vídeo é simplesmente inacreditável de excelente!!!!!, "This is the most amazing video I have ever seen."
This video man... I'm an an applied math B.S. who later went on to do engineering work, but I've always loved pure math. This made me cry, dude. Literally cry.
Confusion
bro i havent even gone to collage yet you think a 11 year old can know this
I love the way e runs
bro make math looks epic
needa math teacher like this
do it with fractals xD
Tonto  1+1=2
i didn't understand anything about this, but it was so captivating lol
This video was animated using desmos
this animation went hard
Wooow this was Awesone Mindfuck Mathematic + physic and Great Animation Wow Interesting
am love it :)
tremendo el naranja😂
I’d love 2 see another animation of the math goobers again
1 dia 5 M XD
He became a math genius in 14 minutes but we have to work for 12 years to not even get to his level
Crazy video❤
Brain hurty
1+1= 11 2+2 = 22
My brain when im gonna study for math test
i love how absolute infinity is just an enormous monster
You know... This actually resembles humanity first of all they weren't doing anything impressive, by their weapons at the time being sticks and stones, but then they made swords, bows... Then guns... After that wars and mechs started being made often so people started making weapons with the power to destroy planets, that being the giant laser TSC did at the end
I love the visualization of different mathematical operations here! As well as how e keeps showing up everywhere in math. Also I realized how much of a nerd I was when at 10:01 I went "Oh f*ck, he's got an integral"
✓ 1+1=∞
I might be an utter nerd for loving that, but that was epic!
No pensé que las matemáticas fueran tan poderosa 😮😮
there are infinite 0s in any number
its like this video was made for me, i love action videos, i love stick animations, and i love random math videos, this combines those 3 things into an awesome math stickman fight, complete with occasional delves into mathematical facts, easily one of my favorite videos considering i've already watched it 10 times over at least
I never understood math and I still don't but this was amazing! 🤩
55x55 is 10101010101
God Animations bro
why do i have the feeling that a bunch of kids are gonna watch this video and ruin it for everybody
Holy crap orange is a nerd!
The Second Coming learned like 10 years of maths in just 14 minutes
I Love your vido
my head hurts  ....
oh my god alan made math interesting damn
Can we talk about how great the music is too?
Now we need a minecraft vs math
So Math can be like Transformers?
Math's lore
Part 2 please ❤❤❤❤
nice
I don't know how, but this video somehow made maths........interesting 😮
This made me look at math in a whole other way. This makes me understand it from the boring and monotonous way teachers teach it. It is so creative and accurate how he uses math and without going too far from the meaning. This man deserves to be known world-wide. This is so creative. I always saw math to be boring when used in anime or as powers/abilities. But in this way is so cool. (Probably because of the sound effects -_-).
1+1 = 2 It is
This is how Asians fantasize action scenes
Next up: animation vs ELA
1+1=2
👍🤙👍
aaa mi mente
私は日本人ですが、皆さんはこの内容をきっと完璧に理解しながら視聴しているのでしょうね。尊敬します。

Это было круто!!!!
obviously Yellow put TSC in there lol
who knew math could be so satisfying
I NOW HAVE THE INFINITE KNOWLEDGE OF NUMBERS AND I HAVE FOUND THE END OF PI
Amazing animation, now you can pass math!
This might be the only time I find math interesting.
1+1=window.
Bro changed my entire perspective in math 💀
This guy doesn't needs an Oscar, the Oscar needs him 😎
you forgot factorials
Is that a (math mech trician)?
Oh no math ....this is Horror 😢😮😅
It was at that moment that I realized that mathematics is not so simple.

Let's take a moment to appreciate all the effort behind this masterpice, keep it up Alan!  🗿🎉
Bro made a death ray with math! Huge props!
Why is euler's number so scared?
Can' practice math in Ohio💀💀💀
Is it just me or do I understand math more than I did in high school?
One collected and neutral 😂😂
まじで頭いいんだなこの人
I would have been paying more attention in math class if math is taught this way
The math is very interesting now
Bye delta, zeta, -1 and aleph null
never knew math could be this entertaining
This is what animators with draw on grid paper in math class 💀
Bro teaching us math through animation, applause
This is cute
Do letters next
I want an animation x math shirt
This is literally all of elementary school maths in 15 minutes
Ahh the legend brings us another nice stick animation.
Beautiful
I've never seen such a clean and well made animation. Keep up the good work!
The animation is perfect, but the audio is just amazing 💀
Alan becker: **Fun with Mathematics while animating**   Me: 4×4=hilux
That feeling when u understand mostly everything in the video is unexplainable.
I'm honestly confused with all the math happening here
Nice video!!
youtuber people: how epic can alan becker be  alan doing tremendous animation vs math:
1+1=2
Are we ignoring that orange is actually genius? He literally built a superweapon within a few minutes.
This feels like going through my entire life in all stage of school 😂
muy bueno gracias por hacer videos
Yo no sabía que las matemáticas fueran tan divertidas y entretenidas 😮😁
when the content creator is bored:
Obviously 2 + 2 is 22! 😉
Infinity=pack a punch
Me when playing with the demos graphing calculator in math class
Alan this is incredible
Me ready to tell my math teachers that an animation taught me more math in 14 minutes than they could teach me in 14 years:
“Wait it’s all math” “Always has been” “Gun clicks”
This is why no one likes math it tries to end you
"The power of Infinity".
this is so beautiful...
make the part 2 pls i loved this  I LOVE THE א
And people thought taking calculus was for nerds
2 part please!!!!!!!!!!!!😇
Absolutely incredible!!!📈📈

I would love a VR game like this! No but seriously I would
Pls develope a game
How- WEEEEEEE
Wheres 0 divided by 0
I’m a fan of your videos
Taught math faster than any teacher can
Um, as a uni student studying computer science... this was a little more than wow!  Absolutely a job well done!
El mejor video solo recomiendo ami compañero el miguel
1 plus 1 equal 11
Taught math faster than any teacher can
I’m still bad at math
Did bro just explain math lore in 14 min and in a more interesting way
If they had explained math like that, I would probably like math.
Bro, I just learned more stuff than my 5th grade class has
waiting for that one comment to say this equation is wrong
Only this channel can take something like math and make it into a epic battle. Amazing video!
Teacher: just solve it, it's eazy The equation:
The aleph zero in end is so cool
Hello
I need a Animation vs Math 2
Please be a part 2
Holy crap this is awesome! Just so much creativity went into this, like how at 5:06 The Second Coming multiplies his trajectory by i. Love how he escapes his space by making Span({x₁,x₂,x₃,x₄})=ℝ⁴. The recursive definition of e at 8:23 is cool, the inclusion of the sine integral at 10:00 is terrifying, and the gamma and Riemann zeta functions, golden ratio, Kronecker delta, and giant aleph at the end were perfect! A few mistakes tho:  I noticed at 4:22 that eⁱᵖⁱ⁻ᵖⁱ is missing its parentheses, so it should've actually evaluated to -e⁻ᵖⁱ and moved forward towards 0 instead of 1. Same thing at 7:29 where eⁱᵖⁱ goes from wielding a -1 to a -2 and as it swings a semicircle chages to eⁱᵖⁱ⁻²ᵖⁱ which should equal -e⁻²ᵖⁱ, then goes to a -6 sword and as it swings a smaller semicircle changes to eⁱᵖⁱ⁻¹ᵖⁱ  which should actually evaluate to -e⁻ᵖⁱ. At 7:44 TSC makes a four radian shield multiplied by pi, then multiplies it by 8 and gets 8pir², so the radians should've been multiplied by each other. At 7:52 the part with r-θeⁱᵖⁱ=r+θ, which is just r+θ=r+whatever, the value of theta isn't correct and radius shouldn't even be changing. Then at 8:08 the non-constant (ipi)ⁿ/n! gets moved outside of the summation? Not really sure why changing the radius at 10:57 didn't put the point in the center.  At the end when eᵖⁱ=∑ πⁿᐟ²/Γ(n/2+1) becomes ∞ ⎲ ͟π͟ⁿᐟ² ⎳ Γ(n/2+1) 2n=0, e's forming an infinite dimensional n-ball as a unit from TSC's reality that supercedes the math universe. So he truly is from a higher dimension.
We need a part 2
I cannot share my thinks with English so will use my native - АХУЙ, no words
Something like this but fully interactive would be amazing
this is what should be shown in math class
And they said math wasn’t cool
who here is still too young to understand half of this video?
epic
1+1=110
I can't imagine the work  Plus you make me undestand maths more than my teacher😂
Holy moly this is a movie  Also the coolest vid you ever uploaded
Estou começando a saber
Ok so why is this actually entertaining and educational in an unironic way- 😭 Usually when I find something entertaining and educational it sucks but this is absolute gold
This... this is beautiful.
it's a math letters & numbers & symbols.
this is not game.
finally, an excellent animation based around my favorite subject!
nooo!
can anyone do that animation as a game.
왠지 모르게 나의 미래가 무섭다
Maybe it's because I know nothing about math, but was the ending a little confusing to anyone else?
77+33=100 right?
If this was a little slower, i would understand, but at this rate all i see is click click, numbers finding pi, emc=2
Now nobody could say math is boring😄👍
I did not pay enough attention in math class.
As a nerd myself I love all the minor details there, noticed a lot of them. I understood a lot of the math, honestly, the hardest thing to understand here for me, was the plot. I can also proudly say I was one of the very first to watch this.
I have no clue how long it took you to do and understand this things, I meen.... ∞?!?!!? And also the imaginary numbers, goodness. I only could understand the battle, not the weapons 😂😂, also... How can you make a total infinity war with just a 1 and an =???
Bro’s the smartest charater 💀
If only math was this interesting
Where is he?? Is he in the trap from VS animations?
Alan, now add another world in the internet, you already have: minecraft, pc, and the web sites like youtube or discord, now are the math whats next in this awesome creation?
i need part 2 or ambatuexplode
100+100=200
my brain hurts  ..maybe because its a potato when it comes to math
Here we think yellow is the smart one
1+1=2
Fun fact: 1 x ♾️= ♾️
Alans creativity is on another level
Math never looked so epic omg 😂
1+1 is 11 and 9+9 is 21 :D
Part 2 please
This is phenomenal work 👏👏👏👏
Waiting for physics vs animation
Wonderful, fantastic, congratulations!!!!!
PLS ANIMATION VS MATH EP 2 PLS
I dont think ive ever been so focused and entertained by something involving math in my life
this is the coolest thing
this level of creativity is insane man
waiting for the nerd to explain everything
Bro can turn math into a fight scene lmao
1+1=2
He learnd math in a day it Took me 15 years i think
Me unwinding after a day of prepping for my upcoming math exam: "Hey Alan made a new vid wonder whats it ab....*oh no*"
I want to create numbers like that too!! It's so cool! Math would be much funnier like this.
test be like
2+2=Fish.
Amazing!!!
5.1 million views in just 24 hours Woah
11:16 : bruh literally said buĺet
hell nah how did we go from this 0:20 to this 10:00
Holy. Shit.  Alan, I've been following your content as a silent watcher for years, and I've always been amazed at your progress. From Animator vs Animation I all the way to your minecraft inspired videos, your growth has always impressed. Your dedication and attention to detail was what kept me always coming back, even though I'm not much of a stick fight watcher.  But this? This goes beyond that. This absolutely transcends everything you've done so far. The utilization of Maths in a creative, world-building way had me slack jawed even past my math-understanding point. You somehow managed to make me interested in figuring out every single equation and result due to your ability to creatively apply it in a combat scenario.  If this video was shown to me 7 years back while at school, you would've, in a mere 14:02 minutes, convinced me to enjoy the field of Mathematics in a way that all my teachers failed. I was not expecting this much quality and ingenuity in a stick fight video.
This helped me understand math better than school 💀
E
Esta pelea esta muy épica, me gusta la temática
Summed up my entire Calculus 2 Class
13:37  e ζ φ & δ?
AND 1 + 1 DOES NOT EQUAL 11 ITS 2
Albert Einstein is proud of you, Alan.
Alan backer is so cool that he made a masterpiece out of mathematics
I WISH there was a game like this.
He had enough making minecraft video
1+1= M
Math would be the most favorite subject ever If math was like this 😮
I saw a few months ago that e^(iπ) = -1, and I didn't understand at all. Now I see this video, I didn't understand better but it was a really great animation.
god
Y pensar que todo empezó con 1+1=2
He’s the only person to make math look interesting
Đù, hay vl.
7:13 taught me so much
🤣
As somebody who loves math, I am quaking in my b♾️ts.
Eu queria estar entendendo alguma coisa nesse video.
Hey alan can you make a bedwars video animation vs. bedwars looks funny and good idea.
I wish I was understanding something in this video.
POV: Alan was bored in high school calculus and this is what he drew in the corner of his math textbook
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 bro wtf
0:22
Apple making the new Iphone:
Aleph Null at the end was a nice touch.
I’m gonna cry this animation in so flawless😢
There’s a nice little detail that the bow he uses is made out of 2x2= and the arrows it shoots are 4s. Small little details like this are amazing and I love them
2+2=22 10+10=1,010 100
I imagine that "Animation Vs. Math" is going to have programming, that is, stickmans will be able to program and do functions with mathematics
This is really cool
Hey alan dont put that kind of stuff in the thumbnail, that equation really scarred me and my family. :(
X/0 😳
This teaches me that Alan can make any fight, no matter how simple it is, can be EPIC.
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Woah good animation
The fact that you and your lead animator came up with this amazing clip blows me away! Keep up the great work!
5:34 it’s theta? (θ Θ)
Nah I'm ain't never doing math
The Math Teachers are gonna love this one
action movie fr
oh no the stickmen are evolving they are learning math! it won't be long till they take over the world!... well, the computer at least.
Amazing how he wakes up in a completely black room and decides to go from addition to calculus in about 15 minutes
Thats a coordanate plane dot and become radius 5:29
Alan Becker is the only dude who can make math cool😎
JUST Perfect 😀😀🤩😁
We need more of you playing around with different concepts with your animations, they are really cool
Math for kids😂 😂😂
I used to hate math but this is like the all time best video of math I have ever seen and it is amazing what you have done! Your the all time best animator on YouTube.
The most elegant formula in Maths against a stickman. Pure art.
3Blue1Brown meets Alan Becker
I really REALLY want these sound effects!! SO GOOD
j'ai jamais vu un moyen aussi stylé de mettre en valeur les maths, c'est tellement satisfaisant d'avoir quelques références (plan complexe, formule exponentielle de cos et sin, nombres imaginaires) mais aussi ça donne envie de connaitre tout le reste (somme avec n!, etc) bravo
Silencio. Empezó mi novela 😊😊
Took me 18 years to learn all this and bro just learned it in 14 minutes
Nobody Math teachers explaining maths:
Gonna ask my teacher if we can watch this in math class
This feels like SC is trapped in his mind or some machine after he was captured by the hunters.
🙄
If math teachers showed this at the beginning of the year the class would become 10x more interesting...
My brain is dead 😵
math is literally one of my favorite school subjects and this does a great job of showing how awesome math really is
Animation vs. Math is AVM though
You should do animation vs among us soon
You and your team are geniuses
It's so complicated bro..
I arrived too late 😭👊
الطريقة الصح عشان تستوعب الرياضيات 😊
He do math
1+1=2 2+1= 21
I don’t know if Alan takes suggestions but I have a cool idea for a new series. Animation vs Terraria.
Also Why is there only one of the 5 main stick Figures we know?
Orange powers getting stronger by the day
i know everyone math teacher will probably enjoy this vid💀
No 1+1=2 okay
so far the best animation i ever seen
Thanks ! Now I have several brain damage.
16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. 18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. 19 This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. 20 Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that their deeds will be exposed. 21 But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what they have done has been done in the sight of God.(John 3:16-21)
at this point bro's gonna be fighting air molecules💀
big brain
The music in the video
Gotta love how Arith Null, the smallest infinity, showed up at the end.
Теперь я понял зачем мне нужна математика. Что бы понять что там происходит
O laranja criou a matemática
What an astonishing reserve of knowledge and mathematical thinking!
You need to do one Whare they get in to bedrock Minecraft and are confused and they see a playor ant go in there skreen and are confused bechas it is. Box or PlayStation and they try to leave
What no is 2
this is probley the best video ive ever seen
i bet everyone now is cheking whats e to the power of i times pi
i guess math is cool 🤩
5+10=21
And I thought I was good at math.
Absolutely a masterpiece
HOLY MOTHER OF MATH THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
this just cured my fear of math
wow
Frl very nice
Jestem Polakiem i wiem że 3+6*4=27
Who needs class when u have him
Bro just taught me math
Math homework be like....       (This.  This whole video reminds me of math hookworm. I haven't been in school for two decades and this reminds me of struggling with math 😂)
Ale to potężnie wyglądało. Matematyka - jestem nią przerażona. 😂
Bro this animation maybe made all math teacher's from earth.
Moral of the story: -1 fucking sucks
No it’s window
teachers in the future better show this video so we can learn math more easily
he used math to defeat the letter e
Uh just wondering is there going to be anymore Animation Vs Minecraft?
AAhhhhhh, my heaaadd
א
this was AWESOME!
Math is not that dificult Math:
Didn't even expect Aleph to be there, absolutely masterpiece :D
When you realize a stick man is better at math then you :
too be honest  1. a stick man learned math faster then me in less then 1 day 2. i actually learned some math from this video
So he has the power of MATH(which is also the answer to life the universe and everything(do the math))              The numbers that correspond with the letters in Math are 13+1+20+8 which = 42.(A1Z26 code.)
If they taught math like this in schools I might actually pass ;u;
So cool! (If you know what you're looking at.  😊)
Просто хочу сказать Алану, что его любят в России❤
Faz o episódio do preto laranja presos
Everything that appears in the video is learned even in universities? because I want to be prepared for what comes in mathematics
Si nuevo videoooooo
Very nice!
this is so cool
😊imagine orange being Albert Einstein! E=mc2
Math is just irl redstone

Bro, just explained the entire subject of math
Nah bro... when they formed a titan it was like an elden ring boss fight
I really like the fact that he skipped 13
terraria moonlord legendary mode+ zenith seed
Math would be easier if it was taught this way.
my brain just got 100000000 iq
awesome animation
That was the best 14 minutes of Youtube. There is definitely gonna to be part 2 =)
The sound effects are so frickin' fitting.
11:05 Behold the power of my ball
Orange going to war with math is easily the most relatable thing theyve ever done.
Para mi todo tuvo logica apesar de no saber nada de matematicas XD
I gazed into infinity and Infinity+2.71828 stared back.
Please make a series
So you and your friend made math look cool! Crazy!!!
me spanich
I felt stupid
The real use of maths
tendi tudo :thumbsup
lets be honest. we all had a clue of what happening until min 4. then we just admired another fabulous job from the maker....
I wish we could play around with math like this
1➕1 =🐟
Finalmente entendi a utilidade da matemática
Hikayeli videolar çok eğlenceli geri gelsin lütfennn
Trending in Gaming 👍
Omg I realized e stands for evil, probably why he was attacking him.
Everyone Know That 1+1 = Window.
math lore: you didnt have to cut me off~ math gameplay:
amazing and mysterious 😮
What did I just witnessed. Art
This is simply a masterpiece 🔥🔥💯💯
Would have been cool if Orange used division by zero to shoot an infinite stream of -0's during combat
🟧🟧
Glad to be here before this blows up
Meanwhile me on math:  *"e"* is the strongest in math!
THIS IS A CRAZY COOL ANIMATION
Please do a fucking video game ahah its awnsome !!
It is perfect your ginuas
bro's teaching math better then my teacher down in 14 minutes
This animation video makes me very very smart genius almost than or than Albert Einstein when I see new maths that I was I did the new math at my school.
hey alan becken what is1000-999   y  2435÷7
this looks awesome, congrats to you and the nerdy animator 🤓
This video demonstrates how complex, yet fascinating and beautiful is mathematics. What a phenomenal subject, and what a phenomenal video.
Is The Second Coming planning a pris0n escape with math?
"That is a weapon, not a teleporter."
Алан, ты за 14 минут показал все темы которые я учил с 1 до 11-го класса. Мне как-то стали понятны некоторые темы. Как, как ты это делаешь. Я в шоке. Спасибо тебе огромное за твоё творчество))
из этого ролика я понял больше чем за 8 лет изучения математики
This reminded me of terraria when I was fighting the empress of light
10:45  MY EEYEES
I’m so exited for this new series!!! New sub
Animation vs countryballs
POV: You needed a reminder that Alan Becker is asian
11:05 Death star
Extra like button
Le faltó el 11+2
I just relearned everything
10:02 ААААААА!
After a certain point my brain turned off in this video
1+1=11
This is how Alan remembered us he is part Asian
How did this go to simple to perfect
9:29
Fun fact: I'm a student and I have math exam tomorrow. Super good timing with video release :)
@standupmaths
Were are the other stickmans?
imagen how many math teachers would be loved around the world if they showed therestudents cideos like this, and also, i would love a math channle made by you if it had animations like this
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
Everything was fun until some weird symbols appear
Beat ever use of mathematics in any kind of animation ever.
Alternative Title:  How to mindfuck someone in 14 minutes

i got lost after 1+1
Everyone gangsta until infinite numbers show up
Dang, if math was this fun…
Finally, math lore.
When you get a calculator and press the enter button a bunch
I can't beleive it goes from the first steps of math to chaos
to be honest..i felt like i was in a adventure..and this is the best video i have seen in very long time..thankew to all who made this..if anyone can relate, he will get the maximum summary of this video.. a big heart ❤
I love this video
Altetnative title: TSC vs Euler's constant.
This was amazing!! My understanding of math stopped at the 7min mark but I stayed until the end nonetheless. I didn't even noticed the video was 14min long. The animation, music, effects, creativity...Wow! I'm speechless. Thank you for sharing!
I learned math
hats off dude
My brain Is gone
This is really cool.
Esto es la clara demostración de lo que uno en Harvard puede vivir 😮❤
My brain hurts, too much math D:
I learned more in 14 minutes then i did in 12 years 💀
But I don't understand what happened to Orange? Or if he back in another videos with original body
my brain be exploding
dude just showing off how amazing he is at editing xD, well done legend
excuse me wtf
10:32  At this rate, with the infinity, Orange could make the litteral death star 💀   11:04  Orange probably made the death star   11:33  Yep, i confirm Orange used his death star.   12:47  OH NO! e IS GONNA REUSE THE DEATH STAR!!   12:54  Did e just save the world instead of using Orange's death star?   13:02  e just made a machine that will most likely exist in humanity's far, far future 💀   13:34  e's FRIENDS?? 'O'
Aprender matemática com professor ❌ Aprender matemática com alan beker✅
This is the kind of thing I want to create with my own artwork.  The feeling I had when I walked away from it, such enthusiastic fascination over real, scientific concepts, is what I want to be able to evoke.  I do not say this next scentence lightly.  *Alan Becker, You Are An Example To Us All.*
Probabilitor the Annoying V.S. Euler's Identity. Who wins?

hey alan can you make animation vs parkour ?
Just learn math
The Grade 12 kids seeing this video:   Them:   *Cheats To Be Done School* 😎😎
Very impressive
Easiest Asian Class:
That’s not math, that’s combat!
2+2 is 4-1 is 3 quick maths
Oh wow… this needs a sequel I loved the ending, probably gonna make some math lore ideas from it. LOVE ALEPH THO, HIM BEING A GIANT IS SO SMART The sequel could be related to infinity, as it wasn’t used much in this… but you found do something else!
Beats the heck out of the common core method.
wow, I didn't expect that knowledge in mathematics and trigonometry could lead to such consequences
Loved this one even though I didn't understand half of it lol. But what really got me is orange just you know casually making super weapons in the span of a few minutes of being there.
my brother snoring: 10:03    ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️ ⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️⬜️

2:49 Now I realize why n/0 is undefined
when you moved from school to the institute
is good 10/10 love that good 😮
2+2=3
I  would like this but that they be with musical notes and with yellow
alan out here explaining maths better than any math teacher in the existance
it almost reminds me of the king episode ngl
Мне теперь страшно идти в 8 класс 😂
no! ITS 2
Wow ... now that was something special.
This isn’t my favourite but I think this episode is the most hardest to animate
Bros litteraly smarter than me
Math is my favorite subject
The teacher of Albert einstein is orange 😮
Holy the animation lore and development is of a action movie class
.
man the music is a felling of akwernes but i like it
Teacher: Show your work.  Me:
Everyone who hates math: "Math sucks."  Alan: "Hold on. I can fix that for ya."
WHEN IS ANIMATION VS UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE GONNA ARRIVE I wanna see them battle some of them
Where r red green blue and yellow?
"WEHHHHHHhhh" is my favorite line.
1 = §
Reasonable fear if math
dang that is some math
Alan is the only person that can make Mathematics absolutely Epic.
Imagine if math was like this
How do you always figure out how to make every video have a fight scene in it.
That fight was quite *transcendental*
The final exam be like…   Also AMAZIng animation I love it
Was that the Hebrew letter א at the end??? What does that have to do with math??? Amazing video as always tho
I cant even do basic math and blud made a machine gun with that bro
why does the imaginary line (world?) appear both as a graph in the real (world?) and as a separate dimension lmao
Thanks for a new beautifull Day Alan,  You are My favorite Animator, i don't know to much for English, but i can't stop to express My love to your videos
cool cool
I didn't think math was that hard for that level 🤯🤯🤯🤯
א
this is the best thing i've seen in my f... life
Mathematics prepares you for life
My head hurts
א
woooow!!! like it so much!! I never thought I would enjoy math so much! can you make one about algorithms?
bro just animated math..
tbh ya loat me after 1=1
The first time in my life that math isn't boring.
this is the same as this as this is the same as this and if you switch it to another computation it will do that and that is the same as that and that is the same as that and if you write it like this its the simplest form of saying that
ohh...I would like that my maths class are like this...but no its just a teacher in front of a board who just say math...And" If you didnt do your homework you'll see"...
Que genial está me gustó mucho 😊
I was fascinated by the ending
13:45
Fire upload as always Alan.
Guy in the matrix and also made math look fun sadly we can't do that
If only we had this mans curiosity
Bring an OSCAR to this guy 👏👏👏
No 1+1=2
No 1+1=2
You should do a animation vs chess
I suck at math so this is a really hard video to follow since all the equations are moving too fast 😂😂 But even so, this is the most AMAZING video I have ever watched! Alan Becker really is too talented for his own good!
This was effing awesome! Probably one of the most creative ways I've seen to tell a story THROUGH mathematical concepts! In fact, I don't think I've ever seen something like this, not like this, not to this degree. And it's an engaging story at that! The sound design is just pure satisfaction, the animation is masterfully done, the action and story is super fun, and all through math? Incredible
Все знают, 1+1 будет 10
Bro turned Orange into a mathematician, no cap
bro in next vedio,,,,we want integration too
Finally someone found something useful for algebra
As an autistic person, this is what goes on in my head every time I see a number
Now do Animation vs Meth
Woah
He learned more math in 5 minutes than I did in over 10 years lol
fractionally atmospheric and tangently eerie 😳😳💥
the beginning
O CARA QUANDO É BOM-
wow
This is wonderful, the coolest and most beautiful thing my eyes have seen, this is perfect 😮😮😮❤❤❤
Only u could make math fun
orange is pro in Math 😂
Why don't why learn math like this ???
This is by far the coolest and craziest math video that I have ever looked at. Great job.
I legit understand nothing shown in this video
Alan Becker I don't know how you made this animation but it's impressive. (That includes the sound effects)
10:58 Genkidama - Goku 😎
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL🤣🤣🤣🤣🤯
Why did he have to make math so cool ?!?!
Que vídeo incrível 👏🏼
א
even without the characters talking you can understand everything they want to say, incredible
Great finish at home :')
this is not maths this is miths
math lore
Orange created a death star using geometry
Thank god I paid attention to class. I would not have enjoyed this video as much as I have if I didn't!
1+1=2
Bro learning math
5×5 = 10
א
is not silly😂😂😂 is 2
Big vidéo 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾😱😱👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👾
2:05 POV: you’re at the boys’ sleepover
Just baggy
70+30=100 clueless
1+1 is not 11. It’s two
When you think it was goin to b a video about it ia it shows this
“What does youtube teach you”
This was so f***ing cool. Please make more
При просмотре я толком ничего не понял но анимация просто шикарная ( ^_^) 👍
WOW I DIDN’T KNOW MATH CAN BE THIS SICK!
ABSOLUTELY GREAT...loved every bit of it!!!!!
What name music?
Another epic video, my friend. I think my favorite bit is the little battle-cry the 'e' made. Adorably silly, yet perfectly timed.
From the MOMENT I saw this, I went "oh this is clever." AMAZING work. You always make your stories so vivid and touching, without any dialogue... Also wow I'm bad at math. Absolute props to any of the physicists, chemists, astronauts, engineers, and mathematicians in general who can look at things like this and not physically explode.
Aleph null be like the strongest boss for stickman
This video broke my brain. Wish actual math lessons were like this.
i love this video
1+1=triangle
Well, You know what they say.  Knowledge is Power.
What are those maths
man, this reminds me of how bad I am at math
Hey this is what I imagined when I go to math class really nailed it Allen
How broken of matrix in alan becker
My brain in my grade determining test:
Ahh... The main protagonist, E.
...I lost count after +
❤❤❤
None of this made sense to me because I’m bad at math
у меня начинается интерес к математике)
...I lost count after 3
This is probably the coest animation Ive ever seen you do.
half of the time i was thinking, what is going on and the other half i was thinking, THIS IS SO COOL. i hope one day when im actually smart i can understand more of this and rewatch it!
the creator of this video is ☝🏻🤓
Alternate title: TSC learns more about math in 14 minutes than I will ever know. Also, thank you for the video, this was a blast. A completely mind shattering blast.
My brain hurts after watching this
Primera vez que veo las matemáticas divertidas
א
The fact that it become weird when  imaginary numbers apparead is quite well thought out
Learn math with teacher: boring   Learn math with Alan:
1+1 is 2
Animation vs poppy playtime
1+1=3
more math stuff
He taught me more math in my teacher day
1+1 is 2 not 11
Although i didn't understand everything i saw, this video was incredeble!
Вы самые крутые
Make a series of this subject please
bad 5+5 500
If they taught math like this in school I would be so much more invested
Nobody:              What Asians think about at age 5- (if this is offensive I’ll take down-
why are you runnin
@3blue1brown we need some explaining here
literaly maths problems
Definitivamente me gusta tus animaciones 6:17
I didnt unerstood anything, but it was the best math video of all  time
And it all started with 1+1
Math has never been this fun
That was outstanding
This is the most brilliant and creative depiction of maths i have seen so far. The mathematical accuracy in this video is truly second to none. Well done!
What in the heck happened at the end
I especially liked the moment when SC dicovrred by himself what Pi acutally is
Why you have א in the end 😂😂😂
I'm the only one who noticed the letter א in Hebrew at the end?
This was awesome.
Well now power level scalers have a new version of TSC to power scale
I will never see math the same way again
Animation vs Turkishhistory please
Elementary will be broke in a few months
You must have been really really bored at a math class
I feel it would be great if there was a part two where he gets stuck in a world of discrete math
Is this a new series
WHOA broooooooooooooooooooo is soooo coolll episode
THIS is how math SHOULD be taught in school lol
Some of my favourite things from this masterpiece which I understood:  1:39 e^iπ = -1 1:49 Multiplying by i probably can be represented here as moving to another dimention (of complex numbers) as they're located in a real one 2:37 The division here for a÷b=c is interpreted as "c is how many times you must subtract b from a to get 0" which easily explains later why you can't divide by 0 3:08 The squared number is literally interpreted as a square-shaped sum of single units 4:12 The e^iπ tries to run away to another dimention again by multiplying itself by i but TSC hits it with another i so i×i=-1 returns it back to real numbers 4:16 The e^iπ extends itself according to Euler's formula 4:19 TSC gets hit with minus so he flips 4:22 The reason why e^iπ rides a semicircle comes from visual explaining of e^iπ=-1. e^ix means that you return the value of a particular point in complex plane which you get to through a path of x radians counterclockwise from 1. Therefore e^iπ equals to -1 because π radians is exactly a semicircle. When the e^iπ sets itself to 0 power (e^i0) it returns back to 1 through a semicircle because well 1 is zero radians apart from 1. 4:53 The "2×2=" bow shoots fours 4:55 As I explained above, e^(iπ/4) means you move exaclty π/4 radians (quarter semicircle) counterclockwise 5:06 When you multiply a number by i in complex plane you just actually rotate the position vector of this number 90° counterclockwise, that's where a quarter circle came from 5:39 Each segment here is a radian, a special part of a circle in which the length of the arc coincides with the length of the radius (it's also shown at 5:46); the circle has exactly 2π radians which you can visually see is about 6.283 6:38 Visual explanation of π radians being a semicircle 6:48 Geometric interpretation of sinusoid 7:08 TSC once again multiplies the sine function by i which rotates its graph 90° 7:36 The sum literally shoots its addends so the value of n increases as the lower ones have just been used; you may also notice that every next addend gets the value of n higher and higher as well as extends to its actual full value when explodes 7:45 TSC multiplies the circle by π so he gets the area and can use it as shield 8:04 TSC uses minus on himself so he comes out from another side 8:17 The sinusoid as a laser beam is just priceless 9:02 Multiplying the radius by π here is interpreted as rotating it 180° 9:23 +7i literally means 7 units up in complex plane 9:38 Here is some kind of math pun. TSC shoots with infinity which creates the set of all real numbers (ℝ). With every other shot he creates another set which represents as ℝ², ℝ³ etc. It also means span (vector) in linear algebra and with every other ℝ this vector receives another dimention (x₁, x₂, x₃ etc.). 9:58 The sum monster absorbs infinity (shown as limit) and receives an integral from 0 to ∞ 13:46 Aleph (ℵ) represents the size of an infinite set so is presented here as enormously sized number  P.S. Thanks to the people in replies who taught me the name of the orange character (The Second Coming), before that I just called him "the guy" here. P.P.S. Also thank you all for the feedback, I'm glad you appreciated my half hour work.
man i wish math was this fun
TSC is becomeing smart!!!!!!
Я: Просто отворачиваюсь То что происходит на доске за это время   Me: Just turning away What happens on the board during this time:
for a person who understand at max middle school math, this is extremely confusing
It's utmost stunning and beautiful. And  actually very accurate 😊
If There Was Even An “Episode 2” To “Animation Vs. Math” (Or Releasing Other School Subjects Like Science, Languages, Etc.…), Will Every Symbol, Or Number In Mathematics Be Present In The Continuity… Such That Fandom Pages Of “Googology Wiki”, Including Its “Fictional” Counterpart… Would Be Used To Write The Numbers In Between Exponentiation To Infinity As “∞”? (For The Constant Subtraction Of “0” Upon Blankness For “Indeterminacy”… It Would Been More Crazy If The Speed Of The Decreasing Of 0s Was Going Beyond The Speed Of Light, Like The Special “GOING UP!!” Statuses From An Elevator Going Up At Least “Absolute Infinity” (Ω) Floors As “GOING DOWN!!”!)
Do you knows iT answer is 2
My man made math into an action film
the best way to explain math

Feel like I learned more about math from this 14 minute animation then my 5 years spent in college courses for calculus and trigonometry.
anyone who says their teacher showed this to them in class is lying cause this was published on saturday and today is sunday
Co
when Alan Becker is bored and have nothing to do be like
For some reason I can see this music in the iron lung movie
It's amazing how it scales from a simple equals symbol to functions, best of all it makes sense how it progresses and it reminded me of the movie "The Story of Number 1"
This is like bill nye but for math
100+100=
Q po### foi essa
1+1=2
Sir we need infinite part  of those ❤❤❤
I'll wait for Chemistry next time ;)
13:45 hey it’s Alph noel if you don’t know what Alph noel is it’s basically the smallest infinity and the term Alph noel comes from the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet
This animation is really crazy. Alan Becker seriously you know this animation thing :)
What happened to the infinity in second coming’s f(•) weapon from 10:05 to 10:30? Is it supposed to still be infinity or does that break the math behind that?
We need a sequel to this
proof math is bad.
standup maths should see this
I love the  sound effects! But the math hurts my brain 😂
Bro playin with physis rn 💀
Math is so difficult but also so beautiful
Monday left me broken
The perfect ending Would it been that He was sleeping in the Calculator of the PC All the Time
My mom + My Dad = Me
я просто  промолчу...
I love it
es hermoso
I always hated math in school. This is the first time I’ve seen something that makes me want to learn math, and it’s proven to me that math isn’t the problem, it’s how it’s presented. Well done!
Gracias profesor por enseñarme a defenderme de ataques masivos
But also cool
Damn so mathematics are dangerous
Cada ves más mariguana alan
This is such a breath of fresh air from the 30+ _Animation vs Minecraft videos._ Not only new but interesting too. If only, I understood any of it.
😮😲
Dude skipped all math education right to collage in one nanosecond ;-;
Only I can say: "Wow". Simple and perfect
I would pay to have a virtual reality software that allows me to use math like this
doom hasta se puede correr en las matematicas
This is the most beautiful thing i've seen in a while
Bro is learning math
Hey, there’s someone on TikTok that’s using your videos and not giving you credit.
por cosas como esta me gusta la matematica
you know you are getting old when you start understanding the math that was in this video
Just shows how important e^(i*pi) is .
Just waoooo
Herşey 1+1 ile başladı
I think the best part is: There's already videos explaining the math behind all the formulas used and even the small details like how the plane of existence TSC enters is rotated 90 degrees. The math literally checks out! Also love the way the "Divide by Zero" is depicted, simple yet effective!
"math is easy"😂😂😂😂
Me gustaría que un profesor de matemáticas reaccionara a este video. Buen video
🅱️
Bro alan told us all the math in 14 minutes
love the animation!!!!
the strongest enemy
e to the pi i showing up everywhere is actually hilarious to me I think I understand like 90% of this, but its so cool nonetheless Awesome work
E=mc²
What’s the big symbol at the very end?
alan becker make animation vs pizza tower please
incredible video i ㄴㄷ으 your animation since 2021 I thought you were just a person who made fun game videos, but I knew you were even more amazing I am Korean and I would really appreciate it if I could work with someone like you.
*So we all are going to ignore the fact that TSC drew a perfect circle on the first try?* (btw It’s an awesome animation congratulations)
NOW WE NEED PART 2
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
really watched this entire video thinking it was some ancient gem i hadn't stumbled upon until today. nope. came out yesterday. alright then.
Welcome to everybody's favorite subject "math"
It's amazing! The basics of mathematics are shown very well! Wow!🔥
За 14 минут видео я узнала больше чем за 8 лет в школе
This would have been helpful for me math exam 😢
Beautiful equation ❤
hei oi
“Show your work”

"How to teach and learn math in a cool way"
I hardly understood anything that was happening.
This best video
Beeeiiig
Es realmente hermoso
This was FANTASTIC.   I wish I understood all of the math in this video, but I'm looking forward to seeing the "Mathematician reacts to Animation vbs. Math" videos coming soon to explain it to me.
When the next wanted vid gonna come?
I love this video ( Sorry for Bad Inglish =(  )
лайк
Овдал
bro explained math better than any other math teacher.
How to learn math in 15 minutes? Watch this animation
bro is the goat at math after this imma go learn some math now
What is the background music that you have used?
Is that me in the thumbnail?!??!?!?!?!?
wtf just happened
Hi, you must have had a very hard time creating this animation. How much did you have to study for this, even if I (a student of a college of programming with a bias in mathematics) had a brain that broke down at the moment with sinuses and cosines. But in any case, this video is a masterpiece, because in the best traditions of Alan Becker, the epic just rolls over. And this is a very useful skill for a YouTuber, to be able to make an epic video even from mathematics.
EPIC!!!!!!!
How did it go from grade 1 math to trigonometry
11111
what do you use for animating? i use sticknodes but urs seems to be better how do u animate that good
I felt like i watched the earth's history, no the multiverse.
It was fun at first, but I think you managed to give calculus students a genuine new fear of math😂😂😂
Today I learned that the best way of teach math is by using violence.
אאאאאא א א א אאאא א א  אא  א א א אא
½ + ½ = 1
אאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאאא
TTTTאאאאאאאאאאאאא א
Does anyone like the soundtrack
Orange is the only one who creates a death star type laser to defeat e
Now i want to learn math to understand it.
math teacher, favorite video be like
Maths is everywhere😮   😮
Reply the timestamp of where you stopped understanding the math
Dude soooo much work into this. Well done!!
Se isso vira um jogo bro
Man AI has gone too far
you shud mack mor pokemon animations
Super cool
Bro ran out of ideas
5×5 = 10, I have a graduate
1:50 when you try to leave school
OH MY GOD  THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST MATH ANIMATION I'VE EVER SEEN, I'VE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS  I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE, I AM ESTATIC. PLEASE MAKE A PART TWO!!!
What was awesome! 👏👏👏
7:35 is the point where i couldnt keep up anymore. I love how the infinite sum shoots its summands and the explosions are the solutions of the parts.
I’ve never wanted to do math before watching this video 😂
Now wait Physics
wow, Alan, it just shocked me how such a talent is still not in government organizations?
Nunca pensei que a matemática iria ser tão interessante igual como foi nesse vídeo.
2 + 2 = fish
Their worst opponent yet.
This man is pretty smart and good at animating I appreciate this work
This is incredible. So well conceived and so well executed.
I'm not a math expert but I wonder if that last equation is the equation to a wormhole
This made math actually interesting.
Este video enseñamas que mi profe de matematicas
This should be straight up a game lol
1+1 its 2 not 11
That was mind-blowing🤯🤯. Pls, make part 2
the + best
i understand absolutely nothing about math but i sure like it when the numbers go click click! :)
Your animation is more than impressive as always, but the creativity behind the manipulation of mathematics in the animation to create such a story left me in awe.
I just learned somewhere like +17% math from this video somehow
Muchos debemos querer de la que fuma este tipo. Buen video
I gained Brian cells
bros trying to get recall in roblox slap battles
Going into polar form to hit the stickman is hilarious
A part 2 would be crazy
High School math would have been so much better and more fun if it were taught this way.
YO that a really fire!!! good job :)
I mean you lost me from the math's perspective at some point BUT this was the best animation I have ever seen especially when you think about the point that this was mostly black and white and just MATH. Also the sound was fantastic. 👍 Great video.
Alan, in what program did you do this animation?
Alan, in what program did you do this animation?
God
6=7÷8
Alan becker has really evolved from amazing to straight up wtf is even going on this stuff is beyond anyone's imagination great work
Wait why doesn't orange know he has powers yet
I do not know what the meaning of this animation is, but this is another graphic masterpiece of Alan
Guess he really hates math. Same bro lmao. Also if the teaching ain't like this then screw math. You heard that right my crusty dusty teacher who is living proof dinosaurs existed, I ain't listening until it's this amazing piece of artwork. Speaking of, you should make Animation vs. Art. I think you might've done it already but idk
1+12
WOW
Pls part 2
7:12 Is this a portal reference?
This is probably the greatest animation I will ever see…
Y
You made this animation tremendous and never seen this kind of math before but looks fascinating.
I love how it transitioned from basic math to calculus so fast lmfao
brb, going to send this to everybody at the math department in my university. genuinely such a beautiful representation of my favorite subject
15 years of math in under 15 minutes... impressive!
E A S Y
nuice to see some good math made fun and interestign
wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow good job bro
I didn't think math could be so interesting
Bro, this is soooo AMAZING!!!
Only Alan Becker can make people like math
Alan, your work is truly remarkable. You have managed to capture the essence and beauty of mathematics in a unique and engaging way. Your ability to combine entertainment and education in your animations is simply exceptional.
THIS. IS. SO. FREAKING. COOL !!  As a young engineer, I am amazed by all the references ; and as an Alan Becker enjoyer, I loooved the animation's quality, always at its best.  That's incredible, my heart capsizes.
AMAZING WORK ALAN  👏👏👏👏👏
1+1=4
"Can one know that one knows nothing?"
Me after watching this video realised that math can't be boring
i love this
no way i learned more math from a orange stickman fighting against math than my math teachers at school
This is really fun to watch for something I don't understand
1+1 is 2
Waht so coll
Alan backer brain: 🧠💪🧠💪🧠🧐🤓😎
Dude, this is actually so amazing!!!
This is the best math lesson i've ever seen
I just now realized that Alan can make animation out of anything ,_,
Из этого ролика я знаю математику  лишь на 10%, а ведь я закончил 9 класс...
Could be a real math challenge if this could be a real game available.
Pov: The gameplay of Richard xd
That was so cool! I wish I learned math the same way as Orange.
❤
me when I’m bored in math class
А можно ещё таких математических анимаций пж
Orange knows math better than me💀
2 + 2 is fish
א
bro just taught every component of math in 15 minuetes
This only depresses me in how much math I used to know.
this is unironically beautiful, action-packed, mathematical art and i love it it starts neat and small but becomes almost larger than life and it looks SO good at the same time  this is great and i would love to see much more of these beautiful one-off art pieces
We still remember when you had a Choke on YouTube and were the biggest creator
Everyone can be the math is favorite subject in the time
That's why almost %70 of the people don't good ad Math. SYSTEM SUCKS  What they couldn't teach me for 9 years, this 14-minute video was enough to teach me equations and operations that couldn't be taught by being locked in a room for 7-8 hours a day. Those who make education systems do not realize that human beings are beings who calculate EVERYTHING like a photograph. We would definitely change our perspective on mathematics as the world, if they taught mathematics education to children not only by writing them on paper with charcoal pencils, but with clear animations like this one.
The only enemy Orange can't defeat. Math.
Poor orange not understanding a single thing except the one plus ones.
Ya se para que es el seno y coseno
feels so good to have seen everything, please make more, i beg you.
Incrível! Apenas
I think this is the mst entertaining math video i have ever seen
Alternate title: TSC gets smort
nice way for teaching maths for kids 👍
Pls animation vs Math EP 2
D e f g h I think I can do 😊
big brain animated
1+1 = 2 not 11
How to prepare to exams
As someone who study this kinds of stuff you have no idea how cool I find it to be ! Amazing work as usual :D
Maths is so cool
pov: what the math teacher actually told us
e
the animation is sooooo smooth
What a satisfying video
Best 14 minutes of math in my life
when is next episode with the chosen one gonna be ?
Animation vs Spanish
Theres gotta be some teachers who’ve watched this
My math ain't mathing😂😂
Genius
Broo! 💀 12:13
Id be shocked if all these calculations are accurate.
you lost me at 4:06
=f (♾️) eso mucha infinito físico y química y matemáticas ❤
didn't know I needed this lol
2:52 very satisfying
I absolutely love this
Dose anybody understand the math in this video
bro had a shotgun
1+1 is 2
тот самый случай, когда очень интересно, но ничего не понятно
Afthor had to complete the highest degree of science in mathematics) Because mathematics is not my favorite subject - my head boiled when they made all sorts of guns there ... ufff ... cool
e
Bro got a whole math homework for summer
Ya Habib Matta Jay clip ⏰
This is what goes on in my head trying to take a math test on full 80HD
Teach me your ways magical stick figure
ay we mi mente
i was knowing half of it to the break point of numbers.
9:54 THAT IS SO FRICKIN COOL!
I wish you could make giant lasers that break reality and make portals to other dimensions with math IRL.
what  a fking creative team.
These sounds are GREAT!!!!!
it grew exponetially... into a fucking Elden Ring boss
I despise math... but if it were THAT entertaining to learn, I'd probably have hated it less. Great job everyone!
This is a math homework but better than other 🫠
teacher: the test aint that hard the test:
my dreams before the calculus exam day
1+1=3Right?
A wey mi mente
FOR ME seeing yt Comment ON A vid makes me work 10x harder to bacome a ytber❤
so this is how the second coming reach to alan computer?
Todo el mundo sabe que 1+1es 11
La mejor clase de matemáticas
When a stick man is better at math then you     🙃
1+1 is 2
alan had no right to made this good of an animation. LET ALONE ONE ABOUT MATH
Alan backer explaining better math then my my math teacher 💀
Amazing as always❤❤
TCO really speedrun the entire math from basics to expert
"Did you study for the math exam?" Me after watching the video: Yes but no
Bro made us cheat in homework💀
😅1
bro made math intresting and fun
this makes me happy
Nice
well done
No 2
Bro used his University math class for an animation
What
343k like.
Hey man! Keep up the good work!
Bro how do you know  so much you are  prof. Match or pisagor
My brain has went to infinity and way beyond
Most epic mathematics
Student: math is boring The math teacher:
me studying for my math test:
This is so good
This is for everyone who hates math. Also, how he end up there?
This is EPIC🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤩
Dr Sheldon Cooper can only watch this in an ice bath with oven mitts on his hands.
Only Alan can make me pay attention to math.
MATH-VENGERS... assemble
woooow
1+1 = 2
I didn't see what is the giant in the end ?
I thought that said Meth
u gotta do part 2 pls man its too good, btw most of us don't know math so that's why its fun to watch
when are we ever going to need to know this?
the math just mathed
Wow bro you are the best animator i know even @Youtube likes your video
Alright this cannot be any cooler
2 * 2 = 6
Animation vs meth when
That is very lú
Me: I didn’t understand anything
No way Alan made Maths entertaining 🔥🔥
Videos that only a nerd can understand:
just wait until they show this in school
Espero que haya parte 2
Until the complexe number l was able to understand but there was some difficulties But great video I loved it 💙 eiπ=-1
"Math is not cool"  Also math:
This is the best math video crash course in history😮
Que pasada!!!!, que chulo!!!!.
Yehu
We need this to be a game
alan can make everything awesome... even mathematics...
1+1=2
i didnt know math was that hard...
man im thinking of *what if at the end orange just became 0 meters big and not to reality
AMAZINGGGGG!!!!!!!!
Simply a masterpiece, I was close to cry 🥺
esto es cine y nadie lo puede negar
Now i understand everything
This video summarizes all of the math I’ve learned in the past years in just a few minutes  😂😂
Here before 1.7k views club 👇
bro just explained elementary, highschool and college math
What’s the sound  or music
It’s big brain time
What a trip. Starts out simple enough, but stare into the abyss for too long, delve into the depths of pure math, and it becomes a whole different beast. Amazing.
This actually taught me a few things about math
best animations ever
Math was and still is my favorite subject, but this animation is awesome! Keep up the good work Alan!
My god taht wa sthe most adtronomically intellectual animations ive ever seen, its was astonishing and very interesting.
1+12
What if we were taught math like this?
O stickman aprendeu muito rápido essa matemática 😮😮😮
what happened to orange at end
I surprised myself by knowing what was happening throughout the video I didn't think I would still remember all this after school 😂
Does anyone knows whats f(.)
4M views in a day
Math is dangerous 😮
Euler is proud of this video....
One job that would do is the teacher, if one day i will be a math teacher can i use this video? (With credits)
2+2=🐟
Hope this hasn't end 🥺
it would be cool if there was a website of such a calculator
this is so interesting
This is me when i writeing the math test
Me on my calculator during class
One plus one add one and it gets to 2
1+1 is 2
Perfeito
someone needs to make this into a video game… if nobody does it, then fine. I’ll do it myself
Animatión vs Stick Wars Legacy
Schools should use this video to teach
Now i know how to solve every math question 🥳
It’s not 11
ЭТО ШЕДЕВР!!!!!!
Αα Ββ Γγ Δδ
Excellent math nerd fan service. Excellent entertainment. Excellent story telling.
So your telling me with this (eiπ=cosπ+isinπ=−1) I could potentially make a gun that deletes anything, and could show my math teacher, and then probably not have to do math ever again
OMG THIS WAS AMAZING AND I DIDNT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING OMG THANKS ALN FOR MAKING THESE AMAZING VIDEOS
αερηδeθψως
a stick figure with an empty head is learning math faster than me
alan becker has a degree in mathmatics confirmed
That was a masterpiece. Amazing music.
I need e to be a recurring character

quick maths ez
Wow 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
it's cinema🚬
he made math fun
music like out space
Bro ur wrong 1+1 Is 1 Cuz you are going to Put the Same number With Same number:/
-1
Pls chemistry vs animation
bro what is the morbin time i just learn 12 grades of math in 4 mins
fucking coolest math animation
My math teacher better be showing kids this video in some time
L\00      Σ+e
Wow, beautiful✨
So how many is 2+2?
not gunna lie, i learned more of math from this video than from my whole life of learning math, amazing job on this video
If orange is “the chosen one” it makes sense the antagonist would be Eulers formula (e^iπ) as it’s “the negative 1”
I can understand this better then my teacher
No is 1 + 1 - 2
Bro i didn't know math is so cool
im so confused on what just happened

احب رياضيات❤❤❤
my brain during math class:
احب رياضيات❤❤❤
MATH LORE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
احب رياضيات❤❤❤
Very cool
Bro has beef with e
This reminds me of the first time I ever used a TI-84 while bored… so many 0’s, errors and 8,518,518,441/123,456,789.
this is like the show where the cats afraid of 9. but instead whatever the heck tat math is, is afraid if stickman
I can’t understand all this types of math lol, I suck on it o_o
i hope we will see mathematical fight in a future animator vs animation
This video called me stupid in languages i don't know
Magnificent
Euler form turning to polar form for a moment was so hype
Masterpiece
For the first time in my life I want to learn math
Pov my mom tells me watch math me watching videos
What 9+10
Yo no habló inglés pero se que este canal va a tener mucho éxito te deseo suerte alan berker y sigue con tus animaciones.
Kids don’t need math teachers anymore they can just watch this and it’s the equivalent of going through high school
1+1 2
So cool 😎 😍 👌
Ok this is cool cooler then my favorite animation vs Minecraft ep 30
*Brain.exe has stopped working*
I just so happen to have a math finals tomorrow. To think that now I feel so invested in math realizing how little I know about this amazing world. And now I also found a way to make math fun - imagining i'm using it in fights! thank you, Alan and the team, for another masterpiece to be remembered.
in computer 1+1=1 🤣🤣
O Alan e o único que me faz achar matemática daora
Algum brasileiro?
I think next animation is going to be animation vs physics 😂
Math lore
This is the epitome of combining art and mathematics. Bravo!
sponsored by math teacher
what do you use to animate?
0:12  1+1
1+1 is 2
Beautiful!
Pov orange: it's big brain time
insane......
Meth or math?
This is crazy! And also incredibly awesome h[ow you used the components of math to make an entertaining fight scene!
примерно так выглядит исходный код террарии
Ur the only one that can make maths interesting🤔 😳♥
Nothing like having stick figures solving math problems in a desolate, black void.
?
bro why tf the e iπ  is a villian?
whats happening !! D:<
No it is 2
The + End = Sad
wowwie
dude this is actually crazy! i may not be great at maths or anything but this is probably one of my new favourite animations
Mr Jamal was right masss could save my laife in hard situation everyone nose that the bythagoras theorem was forced to be teached for the bubils in scools by za government to keeb us safe and to increese our combat skells 👳🏽
O alan ta usando muita dorgas
I want say one of my favorite parts about Second Coming is that, besides his actual combat skill and strength, his best traits are his analytic skills and creativity. Give him a scenario and he’ll figure out how things work given a short amount of time and then find out creatives methods to turn what he learned against his enemies.
Oh god my brain broken
Asian Anime  But that joke doesn’t work because anime is already Asian
How How did you make math look cool How.
*The all new action movie with a TWIST, MATH: The Horrors of the Letters, coming to a YouTube link near you.*
"You killed my friends but i guess its ok" 12:11
Orange Solos Math
My brain can’t comprehend this
this is why i love math
wow math nerds are genuses
Math teacher: *Give out homework* This video: Allow me to introduce myself
This animation ask me to meet my math teacher
First we had animation vs animator then we had animation vs Minecraft now we have animation vs math whats next
2 + 2 = fish 🤓
3:52 when bro saw letters in math he was like WTF (You perfectly showed everyone’s reaction to first seeing algebra Alan)
Oh wow. Introduction to number theory in 14 minutes.
Plz second part but chemistry
Ayo if this  is math i wanna do it  O:
This is not math this is meth
be careful not to watch doubles
Abla dragon olup 5 sivili ye koda drj3x yaz 40 elmas gelicek🎉
the fact that i can show this video to my math teacher that doesn't even speak english and he will understand everything show how math is the perfect universal language
they told me math will be useless  they lied to me
Thins Is kind a math spoiler, i didnt start 7 grade and seing e and i and √ feels wierd😂
EPİC
tangens weapons RULEZ!
The animation is top notch here as always, but what really takes this over the top is the INCREDIBLE sound design.
What if there was a game like that in VR
This video went from p1 maths to university level math to a fricking math battle.
Who knows that math can be useful (This is a joke)
we learn more knowledge from alan becker :)
This is the reason why I don't like Maths!!!
Please someone make a game with this concept, its just perfect, he learn more 14 minutes than me in my hole life
pov: you’re taking the final for calc 2 and your uni prof gives you the most silly, whimsical, mischievous, idiosyncratic, outlandish, freakish, and quirky frq in existence
alternate title: The second coming climbs into the calculator app, regrets everything
Love the massive aleph just hanging out in the background at the end
LOVE IT!
you can even turn math into a mind-blowing animation! amazing!
My brain in the exam:
Orange made a math death star
This is a summary of 12 years of math class. 😂
This turned from a simple math lesson in grade1,into a fight from dragon ball z 😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💀👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
No need for math class
What a fun way to symbolize maths
what
imagine if TSC had this in AVA 1
Good animation
Im learning math better than with my teachers
I felt my IQ rise a few points watching this
Allen Becker made some dang good videos back in the day I can’t believe this video released 13 years ago
anybody else feel like this was a whole 5 star rated movie? it can't be just me right?
I don’t get
Learning math : In school ❌ In this video ✔️
be my math teacher plz ;-;
Видео, моë почтение. Спасибо огромное мне ОЧЕНЬ понравилось!
Truly phenomenal artwork🔥
Impossible is possible creative video + math
Oh no math. Oh no cos sin 😢
I hate math but this was awesome
we need an interactive math game about this
I think I just found the best video on youtube
How to turn 1 to e(iπ) 💀
No no no man scien Minecraft is cannon 1+1=fish
my brain only has 1 cell i cant understand this but its great
Please do a Animation vs Minecraft Minigames
This is what was happening in my head in high school algebra
I Like the musik
Thanks Alan, this helped me study fpr my AP Calculys final!
Imagine having a dream like this
To actually know what what ni + theta is, it's to move into a direction chosen by <- +, + ->, + ^, and + \/ ... probably
1+1=2 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
*I fell asleep on the math test* -pov
war Of math
o cara descobril o efeito do dna
minha cabeça ta dobrando de tamanho
Wow! This is hella dope. This just made my brain want to work now 😂. This has to be the best animation you have done. Good job Alan!
No one can beat his content level and ideas!
Alan Becker! Animation v/s shess
Please tell me James helped you with the math
the madness of math
i study math in university and this is now my favourite video in the internet
How did you Make math cool
Thats the crispiest sound design I have ever heard
Why can this guy Make Literally Everything so good? I give him a sh-t idea and he makes a piece of art that deserves to be in the moseum of videos.
i have never been so scared of E
The guy from the calculator is the best villain
I had no idea that waves were based on circles
This is... Gold Experience Requiem's Ability
i have never been so scared of E
This video was so good I watched it 4 times in one day
1➕1. is 2. You dont now your mhath😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just finished preclac and I was able to understand half of it! 😊
Whaaat🤯🤯🤯🤯
It is incredible what your hands can achieve, my God, you are incredible, you really do not know how capable you are yet, the imagination of everything is very good and I really admire you❤❤
I only know high-school math
Bro made math fun
I like how the music builds an ominous atmosphere
do reading or sciene next
I don't understand this new math! Why is it so different?!  -Dad
C’est la vision la cool et impressionnante des maths
θ/r=π
WoWWWW  GG !! congrat from France we love it !! Team Shibuntu
11:16 Nahh,bro learned some spinning tricks from agent Smith 💀🗿
I suggest for you to make animation vs science video
this is why i should've paid attention in math class
your head must be fuming if you understand this
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
I thought it would be good to have a game made up of only math symbols..
Now I learn power of maths
As a student, seeing all the relations between the trigonometric circle, the periodicity of sin and cos and the imaginary numbers, it was a pure eye candy
This is an amazing way to teach people their mathematics!
Never knew e had such a hot temper
This is my favorite Allan Becker vid
I didn't know math was this intense
Whoa
Awesome 🔥
7:18 Why 2π is e^iπ?
he created a death star :D
Тут требуется подробный анализ сюжета)))
RUSH E!!!
We went from 1 + 1 to an epic math battle
Fill in the blank: This is indisputably the 2nd best stickman based thing ever. And I never thought I'd say this, but it might be a better one than ______ __________
animated in desmos graphing calculator
The crossover we needed...
1+1=3 Mom+dad=baby
it escalated from 0 to a 100 when he discovered multiplying
Teacher:math prepares you to lide Robber enters my house* Me: 08:29 to 08:35
That somehow... kinda made me learn something???
I'm going to show this video to my math teacher, no doubt
I really like the fact that TSC is fighting Euler's identity. It makes it feel like Euler himself is some kind of ethereal math god, which is fitting considering how much he contributed to math.  Edit: forgot the T
THAT WAS DIABOLICAL! In a good way of course.
He’s learning, math
damn this video is so cool man but i there's so much i don't know like when orange was shooting the beams using isin and cos, that was incredible also the sound design was just brilliant
I have no idea what most of this stuff means, but this is got to be the most satisfying video I have watched this year. So creative, and simple, plus I can tell a ton of planning went into this video.
why are the sound effects so good its just math 😭
This video changed my mind about math
it is so interesting
2😅
nerds
my brain starting working in the summer  (no shcool) for the first time
damn that's so exciting. I really love it. Hope you'll make some others like this❤
This is what happens when TSC visits the Equation Playground from XFOHV
my brain kinda hurts 😂
When TSC  was above the Euler(?) army I thought, "Is he gonna bomb them?". He didn't, HE MADE AN ORBITAL LASER INSTEAD. Man this is fun to watch like seriously
E=Evil which is why he is fighting the letter E
Greatest math video
1+1=M
The animation and sound design go so well together :)!
There is one problem, I hate mathematicians. But the animation is divine thank you and go @#$& yourself
N be like at 13:43 : hello atoms 😂
This may be this the only time I have been interested in math 😭😭😭
Que hermoso, me encantó demasiado, esa forma de mostrar la evolución de la matemáticas 😢❤❤
10:15 mistake?
O poder da matemática.
My small brain con’t comprehend all the math going on      And god that cannon was sick
Мне нравится! ❤
1 parent plus 1 parent equals kid, therefore 1+1=3
Iron Man inventing time travel in Endgame be like
Double it and send it to your math tea teacher 💀
:(
your videos are very good
do you know who tomhurst is
me brasilian i dont Spears inglish
If you saw this comment drop heart ❤
I want a part two
there’s no way i just watched a fifteen minute math video on sunday morning during summer break
the best channel in youtube
Orange knows more math then i ever will
Finally i can use the simbles i learned at school for something
Portal
It will be cool if we have an animation vs christmas and an animation vs halloween
I think I like math. from now on...
Hello
1+1=2
X: Is math easy? Alan Becker: No..
Hallolur
This feels like it should win some kind of award. Not even joking this is gonna blow up in the academic sphere. People are gonna show this to their classes from Elementary all the way through college. I don't know if people realize just how powerful of a video you've created. This is incredible. You've literally collected the infinity stones. This is Art at its absolute peak. Bravo.
Hallolur
0-0 WTH!
how did tsc make such a perfect circle
I loved this math video since I love math
No it's 35
I'll send this to my calculus group
Studying maths be like
alan becker is the best animator ever , his stickman stories make one immersed in history , the journeys of favorite characters , alan becker will always be and will always be my favorite animator
I had to put the speed on 0.5x to comprehend everything
Also, kudos on the music too! Just all in all Fantastic 💕💕
Wow
Entity at last 😅
Matematik hocamdan daha iyi anlattı amk
I hope teachers start showing this to students at the beginning of the semester, and let them get excited to learn how all the math stuff works!
Esto realmente luce como un corto que puede ser exhibido en festivales y hasta ganar un premio
Прекрасное видео
Btw, noice weapon orange
I bet that Alan had some form of headache or migraine trying to figure out the math and actually making this accurate and correct. 🤣
Math lore?
Hey, if you can do something with the Warhammer 40k universe, or the scp universe, that videos can be legendarys ( just be carefull with the lore, is so long)
You God bro
If I saw this in school then math would have been more fun
e
You***
Watch Alan Make A Math Series
Iollyou are the Best
9:44 was probably my favorite thing ever, oh my god. jesus christ.
Este es mi vídeo favorito de Alan Becker
This was so cool. I wish math was real.
Who let Orange sleep in the calculator?
mathematics is power
❤❤❤
R = 1/2D r = radius d = diameter
Math! (the fun edition)
if i study maths with alan i might experience the same thing in maths
I have NEVER seen anyone be able to make math look cool!
What's 9 + 10
The + End = 22.5
Literalmente es el mejor que hiciste pero ahora te pregunto ¿Cual es el triple de x ? Y ademas ¿sabes esto?       op(-2)×6² 3x=-------------- +5π rad=¿?       2× op(-3)
small gripe. e was escaping by multiplying himself by  i. TSC prevented him from escaping by throwing another i at e, which simplifies back to negative one. Since its negative one, shouldnt e have been flipped and spit out of the door he entered in?
1+1=2
Where I’m from, this is the most average math we do
Now i know what 1+1 is, Its 11!
Math has never been so epic
i bearly understood most of the math
The math means super super biggest problem  and that guy is wrong 1+1= 1000000
As an Asian, this is my favorite Alan Becker video. I watched it while studying how to reverse engineer photons to access the quantum field.
Ради такого хочется и матешу начать учить😌
that was sick dude, so cool!
Bro knows math better that me
blud made math cool
What my teacher says I need math for:
nice one
1+1=0
Wow, I study math and it was amazing how you visualised everything in a way that everyone can easy see whats behind it like square and so. And as always also the actions scenes were amazing! And the details like that the Arrows are 4 :)
I have no idea of what is going on But 2+2=fish
FOR 1 DAY 4 MILLION
gooooooooood
Make videos like this bro
=3
Want something like this for phy too
I just got an entire math collage lesson
Wow matematica e  a miha peverida🇧🇷
2+2=22
Orange man stuck in the realm of real numbers nearly breaks the boundary between real and not real numbers
This is probably what TSC is doing in in his head while in his cell in “Wanted”
Genial.
What can I say I’m the best at math
My brain hurts just from looking at some of that...
I’m going to the funniest part of this animation so the funniest part of this animation is what it is goes into the portal and the guy can’t go into the portal
The level of knowledge I got from watching this video is ♾️
bro learned the whole maths just by fighting  So moral of the story kids violence is not the question its the answer in maths
dis was my nightmare trying to understand math
I am lucky Because Of I am a subscriber of @Alan Becker ❤❤ Big Brain With Infinite Hard work❤  Take Love From My Heart.
Revised complex no. after my exam 😂
3:24 I can’t but help think that sound when TSC changes the numbers comes from the ON/OFF blocks in SMM2.
Epico epicoooo :0000❤
Bro forgot about troll face the stick man
When did you fall off?
first time get joyful from maths
(1+1)=a
INCREDIBLE! Easily one of if not the best videos on YouTube, I can’t believe we get to watch stuff like this for FREE
Better than adipurus 🤣🤣
only if the yellow one would have been there
1+1=2
The real reason why we need math
the attack was on the students in real life
Bro made math into a war
esto es arte señores !
Seems I need more qualifications to know this. :|
that's an interesting take on math
i dont even know if its possible but i feel like i speak for everyone when i say i want a part two badly, and perhaps some short series
Animations are great as always but mathametical correctness and insight makes it a masterpiece in my opinion. I enjoyed every moment of it.  10:31 it was such a great chance to use linear transformations.
wall e
what i learned: 1+1 the test:
I need Orange with My mats teacher
Una obra maestra
Team TSC (orange) bcz u don't like math 👇
Lore : Orange stickman dude gets transported to a black void and solves some math, then e^(iπ) becomes sentient and runs away so orange got mad and committed mathslaughter
😂😂😂
BRUH
Мы наглый народ и мы требуем 2 часть
Я познал всю математику благодаря этому ролику, спасибо вам
The e kinda sounds likes wall ewwww
As a person who hates math, after 1 + 1 I didn’t understand a thing, but it was still pretty entertaining! Good job, math man
1+100 is 101 TRUE?.
Bro fighting with math💀
2² all know is 4
옛날 어린시절 판타지 수학대전을 보는거같네
How does 1+1 turn into. This💀
Hakkını vermişsin
taught math better than my school teacher.lmao
We all know math is an opinion
1+1=2 yes sure:))
The Stick Figure was thinking in more than three dimensions. It was thinking in Pi dimensions.
I fell of when i (the symbol) appeared
No entendí nada weee
Math is already a nightmare and then there's this equation monster
It’s summer.
This was... Oddly satisfying to eat
א ?
Alan Becker, the only one able to make math a cool action mechanic
wow this is fabulous the mathematics in a video there is a lot of concentration and a lot of passion in the animation congratulations it is perfect
Eu saí formado em matemática
and this is why I love math
POV: when i see rick and morty and me see the central finite curve
what the
I was going yeah i will learn advanced maths  at 1:39 my brain go kill himself
Impressive
its even more epic when you understand wtf he is doing
Time for Dr. Kawashima to show up
bro's like "ThIs AiN't A dIrT bLoCk"
why was this so trippy
1+1=11
bro your thinking is beyond human it really different for everyone
it's scary how much of this I can understand...
1+1=2
Not my cup of tea to be honest ^^'
чё за ху
Next video title: Animation vs. Breaking Bad
so this is how TCO teleports????
Weapons of math destruction
My brain its broken
Why can't math be like this, always a constant battle.
I would like to take a minute to appreciate not just the creative animation, but the incredible SOUND DESIGN.   The clicks, pops and beeps are so satisfying, and everything sounds so crisp. Not to mention the light score in the background that reacts to the action. Kicking up during intense scenes and simmering down during more exploratory moments. Excellent work!
Lore of math stickman
I think I just saw the best video I have ever seen
Ok.. bro really bring us form kindegarten math to a Nasa math science class
The most entertaining educational video LOL
Next video idea - Animation vs Doom
This ix why mathematics is very confusing
@dateunvlog
theory, it's a victim experiment
This would be a great video game just playing with numbers and seeing what happens when you touch them and move them.
Best animation vs something ever
Alan becker make a game
This man is impressive
What happens when a Genius thinks.
Não é atoa que esse cara é um dos meus YouTubers favoritos
If there was a calculator like this, I will buy a Billion of dollars for it
if i learn constantly-changing variables and mathematical constants, can i have math cannon powers???
Like if Tron was set inside a college whiteboard
I love this animation!!!!! Soooo muchhhh It represents what I thought when I was a kid. This movie about maths, imaginary things living and being real, I mean WHATTT Is AWESOME!!!!❤❤❤❤  THANK YOU SO MUCH for this, and HOPE TEACHERS USE THIS TO MAKE CHILDREN INTERESTED IN MATHS. 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳♥️♥️♥️
The math lesson turned into a whole story. Math is now my favorite subject.
Math hard
I can't wait for the continuation of “Wanted”😄
this one is probably my favorite bc i love math and the animations are so clean and smooth and it rlly shows how the math works too
“how’d you get so good at math?”   *”a l a n   b e c k e r”*
Everyone know 4000+4000=8000
2
I never thought I would see math look that cool
Dam i dont remember math being this intense
is that alof nol at the end? wonderful
i ran out of brainpower at 8:33... math gets real quirky at that point! A-tier animation as always! ...AvA 6 ep 2 when?
Everyone knows 10+9 is 21
Supev.
bro went a little too far into the calculator app
That was delusional
I learned the entire math in 15 minutes video
no wayyyyyyyy a video
Alternate title: The Second Coming teaches everyone how to use math
Es cine 🗿🚬
My head hurts but amazing video
Why in the end the letter "alef" (א)[ the big thing at the end ]  in Hebrew is in there ?
LET HIM COOK🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:38 annnnnnnd my brain is gone now
Only Alan Becker can make a video about maths and we’ll all genuinely be invested in it. aye
Where is the second part?
ne perviy
Im just sppedrunning tryna reply to every new comment
TSC went from figuring out addition and subtraction to constructing and firing an orbital laser at a jacked up Euler all in the span of a few minutes. Really goes to show how powerful he is despite his unassuming demeanor.
The legend is back
#5 on trending!?!?!?! Wow
I can make a mini gun to :)    •  =¥{∞)
A mathematician nightmare...
"matemática"
Alan Becker vos Tenes un talento inhumano
وتتتهعهتتوووو
Maths is the closest thing we humans know about language of gods
3:40 이때었죠 제가 수학을 포기한게
AH YEs 1+1=11 2+2=22
SLK entre de ferias pra ver isso top de mais depois de tantoo tempo para ver essa obra de arte ,,,,,, Seloko I came on vacation to see this super top after so much time to see this work of art please bring more
Why is TSC in the world of math?
Math lore
Ah yes, e, a mathematicians worst nightmare
alan can literally make math look so cute
My brain hurts now.
Me in the exam
the transitions are amazing!
Alan Becker did the one thing every professor has failed to do: make math exciting
Who knew that math could be so epic
Casually lovin math
Math in school be like:
This should be a video game.
Terraria be like
as soon as I saw those flying E’s, I immediately thought of Tron
והכל התחיל מ1 ועוד 1....
Do an animation vs real life is a good idea?  Is only a suggestion
Wow, this is one of the best videos I've ever seen, I don't think any of my teachers ever taught me as well as Alan just did right now 🥺
1+1=3
This is one of those videos every math teacher should make their students watch in class
1+1=3:D
Pls part 2
As someone who didn’t understand half of what was going on, this was great. I am not really a math person and I don’t believe most of us are, but when it comes to Alan’s video, he can always find a way to entertain us
I love math
The best animator in YouTube
WE NEED A SEQUEL!!
I knew at least most of the math up to 7 minutes and this flabbergasted me. I'd like to know why Alan and the team made this because all this stuff is crazy. Also i wanna believe that SC was stuck in a calculator...
Bro is speedrunning shool
That's amazing. I love math
yoooo new vid
wow
How did bro turn math into something interesting
omg
👍💪💪 this is how the mathematics should be taught 👏👏👏 amazing work sir 🫡
Obviously 9 pluus 10 is 21
Math is... intresting.
Amazing !!!
im going to show this to my school
All math in 14 minutes:
two?
10:29  Lol, I love how second coming turns a math equation into a freakin’ Death Star!
I guess school isn't useless at all
never thought to see the day a animation taught me math
-1 equations: e^(i*pi), cos(pi)+(i*sin(pi)), others
My brain during the test
I dont need school.I need these
Bro became a nerd. I love it how he explores with this new subject
that's the best video you ever made!!
I didn't understand anything
Jerome Polin pun kalah
This dood still making video❤😂
No! It’s 3
Epic
Easily one of your best vids, and it sets a gery high standard, i may not know allot of math but i managed to keep up, defo gonna show this to my math teacher and ask her to explain this, its absolutely bonkers, keep uo the great work
I was following along in the beginning, 1=1, makes sense. You pretty much lost me after that though.
Math sustenance 💪💪💪💪😂
orange learned math better than I did in 11 years
Imagine if this was physics
11:07 i need to go to the doctor because I was on full brightness 💀
O Dios mi cabeza 😂😂😂 buen video
Me thinking that I was going to leave will continue
At this point I'm convinced I've finished college only to understand every equation in this video
Can someone explain the ending? Lol
Alan became Albert Einstein while making this animation
Геймплей математики за 14 минут и 2 секунды
Woah I don't know what to say my jaw dropped
Math would be so fun if we could do stuff like this lol
epic animation! really likes this
Really want to see the stickman x math 2 lel
What magic is this and is this fake or what 😅😅
i wish math was taught like this in school
I see this as being smart
ALL math classes need to show this, it's physically required.
Best video ever
never thought a math video would be in gaming trending lol
頭を色んな意味で使う動画だ
I havent watched your videos since 2022 please continue posting❤❤
my brain cells
This is crazy how creative he is with his animations
Bro was going big brain mode! 🤣🤣🤣
Great man I want part 2
Movie pixel reference
The fight sounds gave of kingdom hearts vibes😂
Part 2 please
My brain: 🤯🤯🤯🤯
Nah bro just learn more about math I 14mins than I have in my life😢
se matemática fosse assim ia ser bem divertido
Perfect education vid
Finally I learned math
It’s both educational and chaotic, a perfect balance
this video made me to open my calculus book again😂
Your vidéo is magic i'm sleeping evetime
this is real youtube content 😮
Every equation is real
this was awesome
Koleś właśnie stworzył adaptację filmową kalkulatora
You cant have a good time without a Alan Becker fight
O cara que aprendeu matemática com esse vídeo 😎
I hate math
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Bro i geeked out at that McLaurin series part  Don’t know what that gamma looking thing was though but it was cool
Porfa
in my school I'm smart but even I'm lost at the scale of math evolutlotion stats nahh bro what was the answer and why is there more the equations i have  pleas make as part 2 on this please pleas pleas    love your animation they make my day always happy to know your out there making good content thanks Alon Baker😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Añadelo la serie de waned animaton vs animation
Based on my calculations 1+1 is 112
1+1=3🤡
I need the music from this video
This is by far the best thing to wake up and see in the morning
Literally waiting for animation vs physics with combination of maths.....it will be banger for sure
Hey Alan Becker can you be my math teacher from now on?
Your + videos + are + so + cool
スゲー、数学の世界をアニメーションで表現か、めちゃくちゃ面白い
This is so helpful and it makes me want to do more
Math teachers are going to have a field day with this
Did someone see the giant N at 13:45
THIS is why I love math ❤❤
Baldi’s Basics has to be tied to this!
W music
What is the second coming?
que pro
You know, I eternally love this awesome and badass video. Because math was my favorite subject. But this video brought my memory back at the high school, in 2022.
10:00 = When I was in the Math class
Damn, this is nice.
He learned math faster than me.
This is so amazing
Fucking insane
10:04 wtf i almost started get interested in math then i lost 😂
Bros a genius
Alan,where is the others? (Red,Blue,Yellow,Green)
bro was topper in his days
As a man who love math, THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO OF MY LIFEEEE, My brain feels like fireworkkk
1+1 is not 11 it’s 2
reality shock
Satisvaing
8:32 im a little confused at how he knew this would happen if he did that
ALAN I AM SO FLIPIN GOT STUPID
Bro can you do chemistry pleaseeee🥺
I guess math is pretty cool
A b c d
This Animation is boring  Can u make any fighting Animation
yay, now the orange stickman understands why e^ipi=-1
that was so freaking funny when it made the mech and the just said "WAAAA"
Y2w
in a few minutes he held more than I have in my entire life
Amazing!!!
Never watched an animation that both was thrilling and confusing.
Incredible. Even in the middle of a vacation alen makes me learn math.. and I love it!
א.
No @just_baggy 1 plus 1 = 2
1+1=12
You know you're a great story teller when you can tell such  a beautiful story using something many people honestly don't like. Hats off to the team, you completely outdid yourselves!
showthis to kids ngl
We all need stick figures correcting our math who agrees?
No i
Imagining this being played at the Dolby Atmos Theater with 360 Surround!!!
7:54 bro literally said "Room"
Hi alan backer can u create roblox vs animation plss
Me puse reefeliz amigo xD
İm 8th grade and i earned all next math with this animation
1+1 = 2
Alan made Math a great video
Amazing
I have
I learned more math than my teacher…
song name in background please
💀 IQ 10k
Bir de matematik hiç zevkli ve heyecanlı değil derler😅Alan Backer sen bu işin ustasısın 👌devam et👏👏👏
i like that video mre than avengers but not have enough knowledge of math to understand it 🤣
This would be such a cool game concept and would actually in a way teach math with it's conversions. Seems like it would have to be VR though..
I love the fact that Alan and his team turned Math into a whole new Universe in one video. They turned Math into living beings that the Second Coming can interact with.  11:17 I love the fact that this spelt "Lie"
Your animations are always awesome as always! imagine... what if, will start animating on other subjects too... oh my .  this is amazing.
Calculator game by richard watterson
You know the video is gonna be good when YouTube makes a comment on it
“ wait no-..he made math fun..impossible…”
It's like watching an AI learn to think. Incredible.
Someone should play this for a math class and explain the different problems for different grade levels
Math is Greek letters
When your super power is math:
Meee 1 = 1×0
Bro taught us maths in 14 minutes
よき
since when it's epic af?
Matematika ilmu yang mematikan~
Feel like teachers will use this eventually
math but its fun
Every one knows that 2+2=fish 🐟
9+10 = 21
who was that giant at the end? natural numbers set?
*Quick Maffs*
Ohhhhhhhhh  myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Awesome😁👍
1+1=2
We have TSC doing math, but what about red and biology, blue with chemistry or yellow with physics?
The math teacher and the smart kid fighting
I am only 6th. WHY SOO HARD?!
A amazing video!
1+1=2 0:38
Bro, how are you going to make math more fun Alan Becker : Observe
I was in 8th grade honors math, got a A and I understand little of the later stuff near the middle like when he splits pie into 2 things.
天才
Now I've found the coolest math video ever
This is the first time that someone made math fun for me
Pi😂😂😂
hello👋 I'm from Indonesia
one of the best things i've ever watched
Wow math
Math is a powerful subject
Untill u realise.... ♾️exists
It’s not 11 it’s 2
I am going to make my students watch this
Hey Alan where's the episode 2 in season 2 in your videos😢
This guy teaches us better than teachers.
I understood about half of everything that just happened, which is more than i expected to understand.
Bruh continue your “warned”
bro became to a first grader to a 12 grader
Only if math was taught like this 😔😔
This is cool, i didn’t understnad the math throughout the middle of the video but this was really Fun to watch lol!!
Start watch : ez , after : 💀
1 : 0 = 💀☠️💀
math is now my favorite subject 🤓
i like an action, but i dont know what happened
1+1 2 To be clear. my lead animator is 👇pls
Math is scary
I love this one! I'm always happy when I see my favourite subject AND my favourite functions in any video. It would be so funny if there would be quaternions or sedenions.
part 2
Aleph-Null looks like it can destroy anything
0 division
Это шедевр¡¡¡
my brain…🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
Please make an animation vs science please
Alan's detailed animation works are very good.🥰
this video is hurting my brain for some reason
Bro can make EVERYTHING intresting
and this is the reason why 1+1=3
One of the most creative animations (and pieces of media in general) I have ever seen, such a cool idea.
1+1=π[√÷162%7₺)%#-'627
Everyone: math is bored. Math:
1+1=2 lol
👏👏👏👏👏
Outstanding!   I would like to see one on the "MANDELBROT SET".
What a masterpiece
5:53 that should've been a two instead of a multiplication symbol. Other than that, this is aboslutely amazing.
Que hermoso video, ojala traiga la segunda parte
I feel bad for j, we need an Animation vs. Engineering
sorry for those who cannot fully understand the video, make sure to watch it again in a few years 🤝
It" so beautefuel! Im from Russia (I dont know how good)
Math in a nutshell
Maybe Add
Bro this was so amazing and interesting to watch i loved it i cant wait till the next one keep up the good work my friend ❤❤
All math in one video
The fact that he is this creative is amazing
Cool. Now i can watch this to study!
Eveyone1+1=2
@ahoy bang
What feels like is going on during a maths test
What’s 9+10
2:24 bro thinks he’s tony stark💀
as an asian this is battle is fire.
Me drawing stick figures fight instead of making my homework
我身為一位亞洲人，這道數學題對我來說非常簡單
Sooo coooll..  I enjoyed watching this... ❤️
Can't wait for @3blue1brown to break this down
1+1 is actually 11
We are finally using Soh Cah Toa, to enjoy this video
Next video animation vs physics 🌟🌟🌟🌟
İ love math now
That is so mathematically beautiful
א
Dude only you to let math interest 😂😂😂
2 + 2 = baby 2
Dude, is AMAZING 🥶
This is absolutely awesome !!! :))
e/4!? Это нечто молодец так держать ты мир маткматики
I just learnt more math seen this video, than i did in my entire student life. Love this video
the divided by 0 is so canon
Alan,some chinese guy is stealing your video and uploaded it to bili bili and claimed his Chanel is Alan becker official accout on bili bili. Idk is it you or not.
I told you i would come back
It's just a masterpiece!!
Bro just know everything about math for like 13 mins💀💀 Your videos are cool
I cant imagine how much time needed to count all of this
Pls make animation vs dave and bambi
Псини дубе 1+1=2
As someone who is illiterate at math, none of this made sense to me, but it was so beautiful and cool. I love it.
Masterpiece. Everyone who involved in the making of this video deserve the biggest applause. NGL this made math 1000× more fun.
Mi primary brein can't understand this but is cool ☠️
what
i'm feeling a little smarter watching this
א
Математика еще не была такой увлекательной! 😍
That’s why I never trusted math
ҽ℅
We need part 2 plz
This portal isn't the chosen one's portal yes its same
2
This could almost be used in schools to teach math. It'd sure make learning a lot more interesting, and it has a bunch of great visuals for showing the concepts behind certain operations.
77+33=100
I didn't understand a good portion of the math, but this is the exact chaotic feeling I get when confronted by math. Only difference is that this animation outs me in awe of math rather than in fear of it. Truly a masterful piece
I feel like later on down the line mathematicians are gonna use some kinda holographic stuff to do something similar to this. When that time comes it’ll be sweeeeeeeet
Oh my god this man didn't just make me cry with math
Every nerd fight:
I wish math was fun
i hope High school math teachers can show this to students in the future
Best
Help me answer this question..   The + end ??
BROS SMARTER THAN MY MATH TEACHER💯🔛🔝
объясните пожалуйста восьмикласснику, что это за число e^Iπ?
I have always struggled with maths, its forever been something that I couldn't grasp no matter how hard I tried and this video isn't any different. I didn't get anything that was happening but I CAN safely say that this was one of the most incredible and exhilarating videos I've ever watched?? the sense of discovery and learning, the action. THE GIANT DEATH BEAM. this is one of the greatest works of animation I've ever watched, thankyou to everyone who made it. And thankyou Alan for once again delivering to us a banger.
So cool
they made the math easier😳
9+10 = 21
🎉🎉🎉
nice animation good work keep it up
my dreams when I fall asleep before a math test
seeing TSC experience the crushing despair of learning for the first time that 6 radians doesn't exactly equal a circle was so relatable
this was so confusing, funny, sad and heartwarming all in the span of 14 minutes
everyone know 9 + 10 is 21
Meus sonhos depois da prova de matemática:
What the frick is going on?
now i want to see animation vs science
When can we get Animation VS Ur Mom?
When math is fun
Awesome
Minecraft
Wow
i dont understand anything here, still a good video
Still better than Endgame.
Where OMEGA?
I didn't think Math could be this FUXKING Entertaining and Hardcore🤯!!! Why school couldn't try to be like this!??
Alan must have been good at math to do this, from now on I'll see a sticman in the notebook struggling with my math xd
Bro my brain explode 1 galaxy
What is the meaning of this video?
I hate math. I love this animation. I don't know how to feel now.
math 2 just released
Terkoiz is a god
This is one of the Greater things to come our of Entertainment, Media, and Art. The moments in our lives when we witness the most experiences players of different fields: Mathematics, Animation, Graphical Design, Story Telling, choreography, all come together to create something Special. Truly a work of Art.
Now it’s time for animation vs. geometry/shapes
My last brain cell during the math test
Another title: all school math in 14 minutes
When you are trapped in Maths Matrix:
You have outdone yourself ,just wow
Please animation vs king kong,king kong wins
Broo so cool❤
W animation
This is blow my mind
와 표현 너무 신박하고 재밌닼ㅋㅋ
0:36 ayo🤨
数学を学ぶきっかけをくれてありがとう　ちなみにテスト前です
Bro is that Albert Einstein jr.!!!!!
1+1=2 NOT 11
He is just playing with math😂❤
2+2=22
I heard knowledge can be used as a weapon 😂😮 = math/knowledge is powerful
STOP IT MY BRAIN HURS TOO MUCH
The youtube animator OG is back
11:09 bro side i'm done with homework 💀
i know nothing from this 💀💀💀💀
А ведь всё началось с простой единицы❤
Make another animation of this part 2
I like the way you make combat🤘
You took math and turned it into a nightmare.  But it makes since because numbers are infinite. Idk what the giant thing in the background was at the end, but I don't know what any of that was except the simple math. Now you have made me scared for high school in the middle of summer...thanks...
1+1=1
This truly is a masterpiece. Having only been through algebra one, it broke my brain to see this.
pls try making the same for physics chemistry or bioogy etc
I love math
Math Teachers must do this to make me learn math! I'll watch it till the end
Making maths fun
I like the Aleph symbol at The + End :D
07:37 my man was attacking with Sigma 💀
This is the best thing you’ve posted in years and the rest has been terrible Eversince animation versus Minecraft. You’ve been downhill but this is good
What in the living world 😳😳😳
1+1 ?
As a Vietnamese, 1+1 is 5.
Now that. That is a good animation. I played it along with paranoia by Kentenshi and it was fucking awesome. GOOD JOB MY MAN.
you know, if animation could've multipled by zero on those things
I'm wordless. Alan thanks for all. Your creativity ever touch me.
8-4=8
My brains imagination in maths class😂
1+1 ?
One of the few times I can officially use the phrase, "Math, bitches." and be absolutely thrilled in using it. Makes you love math all over again.
I can imagine a game like this, where it's like a calculator but not and it's more intuitive. Millions of people could learn math way easier. Someone pls make a game like this
Bro, all of them knows 1 + 1 is 11.
Aprender matematica na escola:😒 Aprender matematica com uma animaçao:😃
WHO PUT ADS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MASTERPIECE
I showed this video to the whole class and it was really incredible. It was definitely the best work I have ever seen. I really like the feeling of vividly and visually deducing mathematics, from simple to complex, from small to infinite. As a fan of science and aesthetics, I really hope this series can continue and look forward to the next issue of Animation vs. Physics or Chemistry
This! Is Soooo Amazing!!! I Love It!!❤❤❤
Mds I loved this animation pfvv do more like this one from mathematics I loved it
this is best method to teach kids about math
My knowledge and math couldn't handle it after the log but it was a fun video tho
11:29 feels like the left side is the irrational number space while the right is the rational number space
Masterpiece
A master class on " How to make a future mathematician out of a viewer "  Absolutely brilliant
someone make a game out of this PLEASE
This kinda looks fun.
It kinda looks like the death star from star wars but it is the math star.
there are so many things that are in this video that i seen in math class
I love this Animation 🥺😮‍💨🤌🏽
Bro made mathematics interesting 😂😂
Somehow, the ending gives me a scary vibe. Overall, great work :D
1+1=3
This is prolly the first time of me saying this.... I would love to see more of Math
why did this video help me understand maths
one of the most epic videos ever seen in internet history, thank you very much for the masterpiece!
hola soy tu fan de argentina me saludas ya me suscribí y di like
4:08 why does this look like alphabet lore 💀
What if somebody use 3n+1
The thought of future math teachers using this for actual lessons fills me with joy Thank you for making math fun
п=3.14
omg  It was so cute at the and! TT0TT <3 <3 <3
school in the multiverse💀:
Ai hiểu ko thật là zô chi😂😂😂
The only way that I will learn math from now on 🔥🔥
this, is how schools should have taught math
bro why is the music be like that?
This is one of my favourite Alan Becker animations because of 3 main reasons:  1. It starts off with just 1 +1 = 2. And it ends with insane stuff like Euler's number and so much more insane stuff.  2. It shows how adaptable orange is. He is literally just learning about these equations, experimenting with them, learning new things etc. And he uses them so efficiently and effectively in combat that it feels like he wasted more than 100 years learning them.  3. It creates so many more questions and expands the lore of the ABU(Alan Becker Universe) into a whole another dimension.
Ø
Я на полном серьёзе, вот что будет, если внимательно слушать учителя математики
Yep, math is crazy, but its also really cool, and hard :'), so satisfying to see complicated equations and integrals be resolved, but at what cost
You cool Alan beker
My math teacher should show this in my classroom to all the kids
This is masterpiece
animation vs calculator
🤯🤯🤯
As an accountant whose favorite subject in grade school was math, this was FUCKING AMAZING! So many creative interpretations of math concepts. I honestly would've been happy just seeing TSC fool around with the formulas, but of course Alan goes the extra mile and creates several awesome fight scenes using NOTHING but math. Truly incredible work as always sir. I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
Oh its me :)
This is just beautiful.
YOU'RE BAACK! LETS GO
Now i hate very much math ty...
That video took my brain to ITS max to understand what is even happening
This is the most complicated animation I've ever seen. I've got the inspiration for making flash animation from this channel. But I gave up doing that cuz I don't have materials & I'm not naturally talented at animation stuff. But still, I like the project they are working on.  I think there is a possibility of making a game based on this animation. Can't wait to see that 🎉❤
That Is Good Video!
Cute E’s
Animation vs math the game
bro how does he make this.                                                                                                                                                   those who think alan is the beat animator after anime animators comment alan is the best
This is so dang advance
я русс
Of course, 1+1=14.
They should teach this in schools
Уроки математики в иде мультика где битва (математичка застрелилась)
Absolute masterpiece
I'm loved math and reading 📚
Just beautiful
Please do music next
1+1=2
AAAAARRRRGGHHHH MY BRAINNNN
Orange is breaking math
your animations never get bored
Just divide them by zero, ez
Make more of last vid
I am now big brain
2
And this is just base 10 mathematics without getting into much of anything aside from what can be done with addition and subtraction! He never tried doing a modulo or dividing a prime, after all.
This is incredible…it’s MORE than incredible…!!!
Be happy learn math is just like sandbix
I’m making money today 🤟🏾
Finally I can learn math while being entertained
That was one of the coolest things I've ever seen
🤯🤯🤯🤯
Math❤❤❤❤
op
Based on a true story
MOST NINSANE ANIMATION HAVE U MADE
I loved that oragend builded a math deathstar
1+1=1
Math is the key to destruction
Everyone knows 1+1 equal to 3 , right?
O cara fez matemática parecer legal, incrível de mais ➕️
that background music in the beginning feels like an incremental game so much i love it
2:49 he discovered that any number divided by zero is infinite
You lost me at e.
7:12 portal?
All these math stuff gave me brain aneurysm.
now we wait for other subjects
Death star vs dark souls boss 9:59
I would take 100 from my math exam if I learn math like that
This is incledible is amazing even i know how to do math now
i don't know why, but everytime i think of math, i think of the odds1out, because he did mention that he tried to be a math teacher, and he is also good math as well.
9:15 space invaders
I wish math was like this I'd get 1000 on everything
Alan is just showing off how smart he is
Baggy was very stupid 1+1=2 🙄 duh
That very quickly went full Dark Souls
To all my brothers and sisters in Christ advancing God's Kingdom, please know that God sees your work for His Kingdom. Don't let anyone discourage you. What you're doing is right and good. Just make sure that your spreading of the Gospel is in love, no matter what. Y'all will be in my prayers. Jesus Bless ❤️🙏
watching this video, I find math scary
bro unlocked Tesla's theory.
I am not smart enough for this video. XD
What ? 1+1=2
And that's why you should pay attention to your teacher at any cost so u could have a better future
so so so so so good, like unbelievably good..
Finnaly i get someone who can teach me math 💀
Is this going to be on the next test?
I never enjoyed math like this before
The fact that I can understand everything that's happening in this video is downright ludicrous
Where does TSC go though? I thought this was part of the new stickman series for a sec
7:42 smash bros be like
Can this comment have 100 likes and becomes top comment?
🤯🤯🤯👏👏!!!
I am taking a Complex Analytics course and this was an amazing video!
なにか賢くなった気がする。
77 + 33 = 100 🧠
I wonder what would of happen if Euler was brought by orange back to minecraft
i just like how this makes sense
Love it Alan
bro has a railgun
Holy crap man, you definitely knew your fanbase was growing up so you hit 'em with highschool nightmares!   Anywho this video was satisfying as heck, I love the way you used formulas as weapons, the " =ƒ(•) " suddenly gaining (∞) was already awesome, but the fact that you made TSC use an orbital laser with =ƒ(•) getting hit with the sine and cosine hammers in a 100 radius circle was beautiful.  I loved your stuff as a child, I still love you as a teen! Keep rocking my guy!!    Ayo is that Aleph chilling in the back at the end?
The giant thing at the end is aleph
uh so uh E + E = ER? uhh
Now I don’t usually like math but this is so entertaining
Сюжет всей математики за 14 минут выглядит так:
This is so magnificent !! Can't stop watching this!
Trending for gaming when it’s Maths…  seems legit
I don't know math but I watching this video be like: ☠️
looks like a beam from the game portal
This is one of the most creative ideas related to mathematics of the time.
😅😅😅😅😅😅😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨😨
Bro became the mathematics hacker
New video
i love this ,the best of the best epic fight be friend in the end ever but mah head and brain hurt but still love it
please part 2
Math causes confusion for children
Bro I'm only in 4th grade I can't handle the math ranks 🤯😵😵‍💫
I dislike maths, I love animation, this made me love maths
Insane!
math teacher vs schoolchildren :
Ашалена люблю математику
This taught me more than school😂
I'm afraid to imagine what would happen if he used all the knowledge about mathematics
I'll be waiting for math lessons in this format
Part 2, please :) I hope...
PLEASE MAKE A GAME ABOUT THIS I SWEAR I'LL GET IT NO MATTER
It's just math...
This video shows me that math works in life, even in fights 👍😎
11:37 √-0 ? lmao
Why is this so cool
how to study math with alan becker
This video+metamophosis=☠
10:42 nice
ouh gosh your video just keep on become better and better
do 0/0
You should make a movie dude
9.47 is elden ring boss fight
I don't know what I just watched but it was so cool I don't care
Where will be part 2?
nice
bro literally after the -1 i didn't understand anything else
2+2  4  5+5  10 + 4=14
im exploded my head
Wow, its like how...
cuando llego a potencias negativas ahi no entendi nada mas xdddd
Omg I love this video❤
И это из одного числа 1…
昔マイクラの茶番動画で見かけて一秒で理解をあきらめた 「いいおっぱいに愛を」 ってこの事だったのか...
Who were the special numbers with orange?   Another question….if the others were there….like a single time like orange was….how would it go?   Like a separate adventure: Red vs Math, Blue vs Math, Yellow vs Math, and Green vs Math.
Tsc understands more when discovering what a good brain
I FEEL SO WEIRD KNOWING THAT I UNDERSTOOD EVERY THING OUT OF THIS WHEN I DONT EVEN STUDY MATHS ToT
I'll do my best in college and learn math to the best of my abilities, just so that I can one day watch this again and understand the whole battle! 😂
すんごいこの空間欲しい…数学の概念をアニメーションに落とし込むことまで出来るなんてアランさんやっぱすげぇや
This dude is literally a genius only Alan could come up with this idea
1+1=2 2+2=4 4+4=8 8+8=16
It Looks like a Puzzle
request: animation vs roblox
As a non mathematician expert, i really dont understand a fackíñg things about any of this but it really is cool and helps me to be interested in math.
You know that 10 + 10 equal 20 en 11+ 11 is 20 two.         Like if you know
your mind: omg I remember this from math class (atleast I had a little purpose of learning that)
Everyone knows 2+2=5
Animation vs meth when
Matematika itu asik bukan??
Bro is making a portal
WOW
4:26 this is just absolutely amazing!
This could be the most hardest animation that alan made not gonna lie this needs alot of big brain :D.
The only thing that makes me love math
This taught me more about maths in 14 minutes than my entirety of the time I spent at school
Animation vs. Meth when
You universıte teacher
learn math at school X learn math from Alan  ✓
i need a sequel
ππππππππππ
spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bro pls games yapp
良くわかんないけどカッケー！！！！(ド文系並感)
Part 2 pl🥺
holy damn... how dare you to make math look cool.  seriously though this looks amazing
what the hell did i just watch and why did i love it so much
E
What the heck was the big thing walking off screen at the very end?! 0_0
My only question is why pi isn't sentiant when all other irrationals seem to be
ахуеть,я в 7 класс перехожу,и я вижу это и понимаю....
Do you guys think this may be connected with the SC and TCO after being captured? Like maybe the numbers will be a huge play in it?
1+1 _2
How it feels to take any advanced placement math classes: *this entire video*
Bro could’ve unlocked infinity early right here 2:49  if he swapped the zeroes for another number.
10:40 bro build the death star
Even though i watched this i still don't know how to do 5×32=
e i π
My fingerprints are all over my phone to the point where i cant even see aleph
So cool!!! I really thought that at the + End the e from the would move
Where red, yellow,green,and blue ? :V
Алан Беккер из чего угодно может создать суперкрутую анимацию
This is the most EPIC representation of math I have ever seen.
Can we talk about how this video get 4,1 Millions views after 1 day
Brian got the death star lol 11:03
Amazing video keep up the great work
My favourite subject is math but now I love it more.
we need teachers to play this at school, just once please
Mistakes I’ve made in my life:   Waking up late  Not locking the door   Thinking “There’s no way Alan Becker can make something that cool again” and then watching this video.
This was one of the coolest videos I’ve ever seen
8:26 the starting of world war animation
10+10 =20 11+11=twenty two
oh my math, that is so much math in 14 minutes
Omg
:)
This is how they should teach math
You can do evrething go be good with animations, I respect you alan Becker .
You just made Albert Einstein proud 🥹
I got tricked into learning math
3:51 I just want to cry from this timing
Korea people know 1+1 is cutie
When this video explains all math in 14 minutes than teachers who can't teach students one topic for a year
That was really cool
1+1=2...2+2=4+4=8+8=16
messirve
Never found math this interesting
As a person who LOVES math, i kinda overreacted while watching this video but, it brought a lot of surprises, especially when he discovers the complex numbers/plane, and the fact that TSC discovered e^(iπ) gave past-me a lot of theories, later in the video, i can say that TSC broke the border between the reals and the complexes. I just love how you describes the numbers using simple ways, in the end scene of the video, that big thing moving int he background, i think that could be Aleph, or Aleph-Null, ijust hope Alan makes part 2, PLEASE!
ei π
My brain feels like it's going to explode from all this math
How do you made the stick figures
So how to escape this math world
HOW ABOUT ....X ?😨
Where Subtraction?
For the first time I see such a creation, and I think it's time to learn mathematics more seriously🧐🤓
im learning matrix right now which is cool chapter to me
Who else didn’t learn any maths because they were to distracted by the fighting? 😂
bro actually used math for something
Never thought math could get like this.
Animation vs google next please(somehow)
Everyone knows 2+2= 🐠
Duuuude, my favorite part of this was Aleph as some kind of celestial being....
1+1=2
As someone who has maths finals on Wednesday, this is still incredible, and made me look the maths in a bit more fun way, still not a biggest fond of the subject atleast what ive been taught  also i thought when they exited the black space, they would enter the GeoGebra space
Math lore
1+1 = ???
77+33=100
I think you actually made math cool somehow
It's just so amazing to show the all equation show in animation and I just was just so stunted to watch your video.I thought that's is your best work ever.
7:15  😂😂😂😂😂 best part this video
Bro went to mess with a caculator
This could easily have been half as clever as it is and still have been completely astounding. Bravo!
can anyone tell me what those figures or signs are at the end???  (sorry, I'm not really interested in math so I tend to forget what they're called since I don't really memorize them)
Можна сказать что выучил всю математику за 15мин
Alehp is giant?
1+1+1=11+1=12
Why Euler went rogue?
Àæ
Skidibidi 1 day 14 millons alan brecker 1 day 1 millon
1+1=乁⁠(⁠ ⁠•⁠_⁠•⁠ ⁠)⁠ㄏ
He is TRAPED on the math
Yep 2 minutes in and my head already hurts
I feel like this would be an actual game, it would be cool
So that’s what happens in a math expert’s head when they face their own problems 🦉
Inside alan’s calculator:
This is just amazing!
I need to take some math lessons from Alan Becker nah
1+1=2
1 + 1 = 2
Its like a cool game, where you make cool equations and stuff.
At first this was as entertaining as a Windows XP screensaver but then things when batshit crazy and needless to say, I was entertained none the less. That was amazing
nice video
i think my brain just had a seizure by watching this  💀
Salute to you
do animation vs english alphabet
he learned a entire life of math in less than 20 minutes
Orange 10 k IQ
You actually made me miss doing Calculus.
Coding animation when
My man is beyond Einstein
You should have a part two of this episode
You need to develop a video game.
What was that monstrous form covered in shadow behind the rest at the end? A Laplace demon? I think I saw horns.
dude you've got to create animation vs meth
数学は芸術だった…？

10:03 is funny.
Schools teaching math for 11 years One YouTube Animator in 14 min
This must have been such a hard work i think ❤
Была математика Потом высшая математика И в конце звёздные войны, и вообще какой то пиздец.  Думаю моя математичка оценит.
A little bit hard to followsometimes
This is like a futureistic sound effect 😮
true masterpiece
This should be incorporated into schools nationwide
your maths are crazy
1+1=2
Can't believe this is free
数式全く分かんないけどとりあえずすごすぎ…
א is a normal letter in Hebrew
I somehow waited for 0 divided by 0
I didn't know Euler's number had a voice. 😂😂 10:01
Math lore
can we take in how fast TSC learned math or nah?
It's better than Sonic 2 and 1 9:06
1+12
HI @alanbecker im a best your fan im so hyped :D
Pov: the third grader learning math
is this Numberblock Series ?
who else lost at 8:20 lmao
1+1 11 OK get it right
This deserves Oscar
I got motivation to learn algebra, geometry and drawing too 💓
By the time he gets to calculus bro's going for the nearest eraser.
How did you make math cool?
I wish there was an app that lets you do this with math
Thanks for the amazing videos👍
I'm really love this🙂
Never thought I would be glad to learn math from school just because understand the equations from a stickman animation :D   I was like "no way they went to irrational numbers dimension "
Teachers: The internet doesn't teach you anything! *The internet:*
Absolutely incredible. The modern equivalent of Donald in Mathmagic Land.
함수 넘어가면서 이해를 포기함  나에겐 너무 버거운 개념들이야
this is like one of those games where you're so confused as to where to start, but then become a god in the endgame
Como te llevas con la matemática? Yo automáticamente 😎😎:
cant wait for animations vs physics
is this episode 2 of wanted animator vs animation
In higher mathematics, any number divided by 0 gives infinity, because the closer the divisor is to zero, the greater the quotient
Ok am i the only one who doesn't know what's happening 💀
They got no ideas left so they did a stickfigure fighting integers and pi
Math war
it very good I like math!!!!!!! and science
Alan Becker is the only animator who can make math whimsical
I love it🙂
I hop there's a part 2 or maybe not
everyone knows that 1+1=2 equals 112
The second coming playing a fps game with math
How teachers think math will help you with
Ive never been a math guy but this animation is epic.
this is gonna give a straight a in math test
1+1=2
Do the floor is lava with a crown for the winner and a among us video also a fall guys with a crown for the winner
Wow, that was awesome! Loved the animation and the use of maths to tell a story!
Yeah i know 1+1=11 😎
Animation vs chemistry and physics💀💀
Same
I can only imagine the insane battle TSC would have against E=MC2
Maybe you can play but is nothing
A saord and a cuanting😢😢😢
This is ingenious
Almost everyone didn't get the joke😂
This animation got me thinking. Thank You 😂
Шикарно 😍👍
If this was how they would teach math. I'd actually know sum.
Alan You're the best!
But this video is fantastic and as a math lover on my favourites Keep up with the great work
Whats math
🧠❤️
Proof that math is chaotic
Matematica yeas
Probably the best math video on YouTube lol
Xem xong làm bậc thầy toán học lúc nào không hay :)))))
Animation vs. the Periodic Table please 😊
Он даже математикой дерется
Next: Animation vs. Music (Notes, Rythms, Beats and very indepth stuff)
i love math more now             is that good?
Are u drunk?
i think, it is good to make game with this concept!
Please do animation vs physics too it would be awesome
I really want to see a math proffesor react to this video.
Epic
Alan just made math fun
Some math teacher is gonna show this to their class one day as a lesson example
The Matrix "New level"😂😂😂👍👍👍
I had never pictured math to be this cool before
Im trying to learn   this subject about 7 years i didnt learnt anything but this guy learned about 14 munites
that 's how mathematics was created !
If my Math teacher taught me like this, I would've been the next Einstein
It kinda just hit me that this video is almost universal (only language spoken is math), until the end when he asks Euler's for an e×iτ
This video was amazing
It's + amazing!
I definitely knows nothing about math
Hit me if u love Alan Becker 🧡
Math Fun
alan pls turkiye vs animation plss i like you
Bro teached every mathematics basics under 14 minutes which instead of feeling boring was enjoying to watch 💀
У меня вопрос где он находится???
Please do animation vs animator episode two
What
Ледис энд джентельменс
So beatiful video
10:33 bro made the death star
Me: The Second Chosen now a mathematician  Also me at the end: Wait, aleph-0 ???*background music start playing*
5:28 this is a Doctor Strange
1+1=window 🪟 😂😂😂
i love how he discovers euler's identity right after discovering negative numbers, like its a really big jump lol🤣
That was a cute and relaxing animation.
i think animation vs physics would be a cool concept
Зто математика 6–11 классы
you from israel? the giant  Letter in the and was from israel
When you need to show that you are Asian
absolutely amazing
that was an cool fight
1, the strongest number, also math had never been more fun
This dude made a math bossfight
Can't wait to study Math now so I can understand this video
The amount of brain that actually went into this 💀  Edit: why are there only nerds in the comment section??
no  two
The sound's effect's soooo AMAZING 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The sheer thought and attention to detail that went into this blows my mind.
А говорят математика это сложно
1+1=kfc
Bro made a whole movie
Watching this made me want to make a math themed fighting game.
It's a really amazing animation It's fantastic
This is why you never open the calculator.
TSC is facing of against something we all fear....... math
ēįõş:)
1+1=3 right
Who knew math…..COULD BE SO COOL.
Man's recreating the universe.
This video shows more than what I have learned in 10 years.
Hey man. I'm a math nerd myself, so I couldn't help but notice something wrong in that video.  The equation at 4:01 is wrong. i * i * i can be simplified into -1i. That complex number has the radius 1 and the argument -π/2 (or 3π/2, depending on your domain of definition). So that would mean that in the Eulerian formula (wich you use to represent the number) you would have: e^(-iπ/2). There is another mistakes afterwards. 4:16 the minus in front of the cos makes the conversion wrong. -e^(i*π) is the same as -1. The conversion into the normal form for that would be: cos(π)+i*sin(π), wich is in fact -1. I don't know why you would put a minus in front of the cos, that just makes the number 1.  I think it's a bit weird that you do the exact same conversion at 7:19, but that time you do it right.   But don't get me wrong, I love the video, it's a really cool idea and the math you use, there are some complicated things in there, so respect for that. I'm just a math nerd that noticed something ;)
Now i like matematika
Bro orange learns more than the normal college student in under like 10 seconds
This was amazing i like math can you make part 2
Yoh. This is the hypest thing I've ever seen.  It was like a shonen anime battle with rules that I genuinely did not understand because it was all MATH related.
@just_baggy 1+1=2 mother fuvker
Probably the strongest Chosen has ever been
Orange make dead star with math ☠️☠️☠️
Break my mind
While every one else is fighting over a race, TSC did some math😂
Mathematician
A pure masterclass
alan becker is one of those people who can make math more interesting
Me messing with the  calculator:
Только алан модет сделать из скушной математики крутой экшн
The power of mathematics
what type of beautiful masterpiece did i just witness
My brain: 🤯🤯🫨😵‍💫😵‍💫😵
Bro he's smarter than my math teacher
Uish ada kuasa baru😮
ares un maldito genio
You amazing 100 💯 math 😮
1+1 is 2
My head is so tickle I think my brain it's gonna grow bigger
MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN ME IN SCHOOL MATH CLASS FOR 10 YEARS
i see grey the br end
In 10+ years later  2020s kids : core memory unlocked
Imagine if he can make  *Animation vs science*
I realy love how complex numbers sneaked in and out the whole time but the tutoial was a bit to fast for me.
WHY IS NOT 2+2 :_(
Mathematics is fun bro:)
Fun fact: The unknown big object in the end is the Aleph number.
Mathematics is fun bro:)
mới 1 ngày mà 4,1 triệu ôi vãiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Math is very fun 😁
Orange is smart to math.Orange's friend is no body knows 😅😅😅
creative video
1+1=2
8:16 £: >AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<
How hard was it to get all the math questions for this video?
No is 1+1 isss 2
"How do you understand Math?"  "By my teacher."  "Whats your teacher name?"  "The second coming."
The second coming is ao smart😮😮
this taught me more math than school
after this video all the people who hate math so bad , now they argue with everyone by the knowledge of math .
This video taught me better than my math teacher could
this is like a movie✨✨
Thats the best math project I've ever seen
Make a part 2 please 🥺
Its masterpiece 🤙🤙
Math truly is terrifying.
13:45 WTF IS THAT GIANT SYMBOL
Bro did the unthinkable...got top 50 gaming with fricking math!
Hmm... idk what, but now, math is my pafourite 🗿

the most epic math in the world I would like to play such a game, but there is no such game, but there is animation.
Bro imagine alan opening his calcuator and he be like  Alan:👁👄👁
This man is so creative he gave mathematics an antagonist *W* *H* *A* *T*
3Blue1Brown might like to check this out...
*"And that's how i became genius"* -The Second Coming
My brain exploded while watching this video🤯☠️
as a year 8 student, I lost when bro pulled the imaginary number
I like how they make every character in their animation can fight like they trained for years and the way they turn stuff into weapon and immediately know how to use it in the most diverse and unique way
please make your game
bro turned boring stuff into something exciting, I love maths now!!
Bro made a death star using math
Pov me plaing wif a claculator
1+1 is 21
wow I know  all of these equasions are completely accurate and very smart, but I am just to dumb to understand any of them. Great work!
Whooooo!!
my brain, hurts from the da match!! is orange that smart or he is just guessing? guess im dumber then orange.
NO MATH
I just witnessed something I didn’t know I needed  to see
4:00 there my math knowledge ends
The best math video ever , for students
I can't stop goosebump It MASTERPIECE!
Bro i learned more from here than actual math class
stick figure vs twitter
Ive never payed more attention to a math video until today
Will there be an animator against physics? :)
I think orange is now smarter than his friends now
Dude makes me want to study 😅
never thought i'd see fighting with math
Bangers as always
Pov: You send this to your Math Teacher
This just makes me wanna make a game where all the power exists on how you use mathematics 😂
... it hurts my brain
Can't tell if I wanna cry because it's so good and creative or from utter confusion
What is that big think on the end called
I'm waiting for a continuation in trigonometry :)
don't worry, math can't hurt you...>_o  *the math :*
P.o.v : me that never understood something in math : WHERE ARE THE FIGHTS !!
cool until 4:00
Imagine if the whole thing happened inside alans calculator
DAMN  , WHAT A NICE VIDEO ITS AWESOME WOW..
ME losing huge amount of braincells
rush
I need a video with an analysis of all the mathematical operations from this masterpiece!
1+1- 2
That's how cool math🤣
the best animation i ever seen in my life❤❤❤
Godlike animations as always
Bro just did maths without words more interesting than maths with words.
I feel like this thing teaches me more and making it easy to understand than my math teacher
I saw a big N when I got to 13:45 and I turned on all the lights of the ibad so I could see the N. And I'm sure very few people could
when you skip the tutorial and end up with the secret ending
This guy has explained the hole history and rules of maths in 14 minutes😮.what impressive 😎
nhức nhức cái đầu
I think i share this vidéo for my kid
Bro💀?
11:34 Supermassive black hole emitting energy
This is my phobia  Mathphobia💀💀💀💀
Это видео для моей математички 🤣🤣🤣
orange teaching us how math work in -:0:01 + 14:02 minute legitly
As a 6th grader I can confirm that I only understand 16 percent of the video
finally, a match against true evil
More like star war math edition
Can u pls tell me when will episode 2 release on animator vs animation VI
ANNNNNNND that's how you make maths cool amazing job
1 + 1= 11
Me fighting to find the X
Bro thinks he’s Albert Einstein
Yeni kılıç 1          ,  ,    ,  +
After this video, palpatine decided to build the death star
👏👏👏👏👏
Math video part 2
This is the only time Math has ever been cool since it has existed
🇸🇬
I don't seem like this video in my life
In 1 video, he showed the mathematics of the entire school.
1+1=3 :D
Power of Maths 😮
THIS IS THE BEST!!! ANIMATION I EVER SEEN THIS IS SO COOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1+1is 2
1+1 is 3
I want veratysium channel to breakdown this video
2+2=fish 🐟
1 + 1 is 11 beacuse there is no equal
bro need make his own game math sandbox familiar like plant sandbox
Good video and make my brain is not braining now im waiting animations vs gravity.
I learned more math from this than school
How to get people into math:  The Wrong Way: *Teach them that it’s important for their future* -Makes no sense -Boring -Barely any jobs you would need to use math for -I would rather watch Pluto Nash in 3D than learn why it’s important for the future  The Right Way: *Show them how they can make cool weapons with it* -Makes sense -Awesome -Multiple jobs can be solved with that kind of power -I wouldn’t watch ANY good movie if I could do THAT kind of math power
we need math class like this
Maybe the best video in the Youtube for the last 10 years. I am just speachless!!
Epic
Nah bro is the  The albercond coinstein (The second coming + Albert Einstein) 💀       1=1 number = THAT?
Huh can somebody tell me what happened in the ending
soooo... where is orange?
Math teacher Who is watching this video be like:🫨🫨🫨🫨🫨🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
New power unlocked: math ver:1 (Mission to unlock ver:2: go to India)
About a quarter of the way through i started going "what da fak is this"
Theend 7+7?=̴╌¡\≄
i smell burning after i watch this
Man, i need Alan to be my math teacher
Please make this ( the events in this video) the source of oranges power 🙏 and make him a god. Maybe that’s what the new villains want?
Better than my math teacher
Блеск!
I want a question whose that bigger than another in ending?
No one knows why i have likes.
Alan. You are a GOD❤
The best math video I've ever seen
Orange just dies!?! Edit:nvm he went home he didn't die pol
At least he didn’t divide by 0
Part 2!!!
Nerds love this video.                                        I guess i'm a nerd.
1+1 Is 2
👍👍❤❤
Is this the mind of an asian school student?
mi mind is so break
This shows how cool maths really is
idea- animation vs scinece
Great work broo 👍🏼👏👏👏
Pov you know that one question everyone else did not
Игра в калькуляторе вышла на новый уровень
9:46 they're assembling the OmniMegaChessatron
Bro was fighting with god equation 💀
1+1=2
Man that was fucking amazing, I’d love to see another part
Bro learned full math for 1 episode💀
I got called stupid in this video in 115811691619151241 ways
Im curious what will it look like if "Animation vs. Science"
1: - Addition. - Subtraction. - Negative. - e iπ. 2: - Multiplication. - Division. - Repeated multiplication. - Fraction. - Square root. - i. 3: - Dot. - Circle. - Angles. - Radius, diameter and circumstances. - π. - Sin and cos. - iSin. Post 3: - Using = f (•) as a gun and then replacing • with infinity to OP it. - The e iπ god.
I want mr alan becker to be my mathematics teacher
bro it 2._.
Bro *summed* up all 12 years of math class  haha
Bro you made me like math 😂
I very like it's thattttt but it's don't have Ω bro but is very cool
wow it's a genius idea
Pls next is science pls pls
Math lore💀
Bro went from basic maths to baldi
Dear Alan Becker!! please, if it's not difficult for you, can you make a red stickman version of this video?? thank you very much in advance!
bro learned high end math in less than 15 mins .... this is called talent
Bro taught me math in 15 minutes
Why is there like a mysterious vibe when watching this
3Blue1Brown really need to make a full explanation in this video
Im and mach
😮😮❤❤❤
Only alan becker is able to make math interesting and exciting
Keren parah coy
I think  it's backrooms level 2×2
😮😮❤❤❤
Just saw someone do the 6x3 meme with the title Animation vs Math (unofficial) two days ago and now I see this.
@fajri
i dont even have words to describe how good it was
هاذا العمل مذهل جدا  لقد اعدت الفيديو 4مرات  ولم امل منه ابدا ولقد اصبحت احب الرياضيات أكثر من قبل  . وشكرا😊
very good
i really learned some intence math today
How to learn math in 15 minutes
This hurt my brain
My favourite part was when it said "Its taylor series time", and taylor seriesed all over the screen.
Amazing creativity!
gracias a este youtuber se iso interesantes las matematicas
I love math!❤
aight someone send this to the aliens to explain our numerical notation...
me when doing my homeword be like this
Hah next animationt vs game brawl stars
In this video i seen  all the power of math.
my last braincell during a math test:
Math boss be like:
Meth should be for war, not study
now THIS is how you make math fun
When Orange jumps into the calculator site
Thank you for representing complex numbers as the main villain. As an high schooler I can more than confirm that complex numbers are the baddest villains mathematicians have made. Ever.
Next time animation vs coding
This is the most creative one you have don yet so far
This is an accurate depiction of my struggles with math class in high school.
Calculator 2 leaked gameplay
I love how Alan described 'dividing by zero'
ASCII art to the next step 🔥
This should be taught in schools. Kids will have a banger learning maths.  I say this as someone who loves maths and had it as her strongest subject.
next idea : Animation vs Redstone
Please Animation vs Dead Cells Or Animation vs Terraria Please please please please
Alan is one smart guy
It so good!!!
I'm pretty dumb when it comes to math ☹️
Where did the orange go when a white circle around the orange and then the orange disappeared along with that circle?
**Sniff sniff** Aaaah  I just love the smell of METH.......
😂Students and their suffering with exams
math lore
Wow! This animation just gave math so much power!
У меня уж мурашки были во время видео!
This is how people discover calculus
this animation explains quite clearly that, math is very hard to understand 🙂
Math is hard, but after watching this, my brain had a stroke seeing all those numbers
The people who are learning:
1+1=1.0 ez
13:32 Only smarter people can know...                           WHAT THE FRICK THESE MATH SYMBOLS ARE?????
Nobody likes math
This is the best🤯 animation ever!!!!! Can you make more of them please!!!!!!!😀😀😀
The Second Coming discover math Now he gonna be smarter and stronger
Kids watching:WHAT THE ******     Me:Omg
Present
Animasi bang Alan yang satu ini benar-benar luar biasa. 👍
This made math fun with imagination
Alan becker just mixed Puss in Boot, The Matrix, Star Wars, Avenger, John Wick, Mission Impossible, Jame Bonds and Transformer in 1 Video
my brain suddenly grows bigger
this is genius, complex + simple = masterpiece
>4M VIEWS IN 1 DAY DUDE :)))
we need a video with a mathematician reacting to this
Loved it❤
This is so cute :D
今回はあんまり面白くないな…) )殴
ANIMATION VS MATH 2
1+1=2
10:03 waaaaaa!
and only with Alan to focus on learning math
I get dizzy looking at all these formulas😵‍💫😵‍💫
１＋１は田んぼの田
Math > Minecraft
Mind blowing literaly
NICE VIDEO
How ironic I understand most than in my class
nah bro after this math is hella fun
i swear math teachers need to teach like this
YOOO PEOPLE FROM THE HARD ROCK COLISEUM WORKED ON THIS AND EVEN THE LEGEND OF STICK FIGURES TERKOIZ itself !!!!!!!!!! what a time to be alive
OMG my brain
Alan Becker creator of the best animations in reality
math is war
This music sounds like it would be in a space science documentary and I love it can you make more animations with music like this please it’s so good.
Legendary idea
10:02 you can’t convince me that wasn’t adorable
BROOOOOO THAT WAS THE COOLEST ANIMATION ABOUT MATH I HAVE EVER SEEN, THIS CHANNEL HAS EVOLVED SO MUCH
That was so epic though I didn't understand the most of equalities
Wtf one day 4million view💀
I do not want to be negative, but if, at the end, the whole equation equals to -1...he just negated the stickman, so...killed him
The one true Number Lore we didn't know we needed
0:48
Unbelivable he made math fun
How did orange get in to the math universe?
That's 1 way to get an A+ in math
Dont forgot guys it all started with an trampoline
You know what this is the best video i seen for this week
Question: How did he get there?
I'm sure 3^2=6
Everyone knows 1+1 is 11
As a nerd and someone who takes pride in learning maths I absolutely adored this, every little detail and equation/properties as well as smaller things like the first proper fight between Euler's identity and The Second Coming having -1 and +1 as weapons that, when clashed, produced a "zero", as well as the -4 slowly going back to -1 whenever it would clash with +1, adhering to maths itself. When either got hit by a negative it would change their direction in the opposite direction, the two +1 swords forming a bow and arrow with 2's and a multiplication sign to shoot "4" arrows and more genius details, absolutely MATHnificent Edit: thank you @skelthegdpotato for the pun
Hope the next generations learn math in more fun way like this
Me who terrible at math and confuse about all this animation but still enjoying the video and the asmr sound effect
8:09 digits of pi     Edit- dam bro 22 likes?! Yall prob like me smh  Edit2- Some digits are negative snd some ×i
This is dream of Math.
Yeah, of course Alan made me like math. This is what he does, right?                                      I just love how this 0:14 went to this 9:14
=f(•)
Гениально
Bros forcing us to learn maths
bro really just speedrun from the easiest math to the hardest math
The Stickman is smart better than me
e=mc² 🗿🗿
This. Is. Awesome!!!! (Genuinely made so many different concepts make a lot more sense when you could visualise them like this). Sending it to my friend who is a maths teacher, so that they can appreciate it as well.😊
What the ...
This is me every time i take a math test, but with more dimensional collapse.
simple redstone
father of mathematic .brilliant man
Maths lesson level hard
Interesting
This was beyond perfection My interest in Maths has achieved new heights
I've got a physics degree. Most of that was learning the way math weaved around reality.  This is exactly what it felt like.
If this video is a game, it must be amazing! And I definitely want to play it.
Everyone know 9+10 is 21
bro is a stormtroper at 5:00
ANIMATION vs CODE next?!
It's the Mathrix, Neo.
i do not know enough maths to fully appreciate this video, but hey it was another cool stick fight
Hi
where white?
its time for everybodys favorite subject MATHHHHH
1+1 is 11 😮
Damn, I wish you could do a collab with 3b1b. That would be probably awesome!
The YouTube algorithm has blessed me.
my brain in math be like. Respect to alan and his team, this is so good
Pov: when you help your little brother with math
phenomenal video as always!! Alan never seems to miss‼️
So now i understant Math thx
can you do chemistry/organic chemistry then?🤩
bro learned more math in 14 minutes than me in 12 years
When you have the motivation. . . Anything is possible.
Alan please make this a series
Make great animations all you want, I still refuse to do that homework.
If this is a real game I would definitely play
Origin of second coming
well that escalated quickly...
😂The aaaaaa of the "E" (I don't even know what that number was) was the best 😂
Cucolator gameplay
What 🤮
e^iπ
next video Animation vs Calculator
Am I the only one who's actually confused?
I (...♾️
サムネイルの色が...いえ、心が汚れているのは私だけですね
And this is how my teacher explains math
0:34 dang he’s too smart
art.
Can't wait for Animation vs. Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 👀
Gu 😂
WOW! This is Brilliant!
The thing that is power full like the minecraft block is the infinite symbol
There is no way I watched the entire 14 minutes video about Math with my own free will
Finally someone made math looking cool
someone: mathematics is boring and uninteresting also mathematics:
∞%
Best animation and sound track so far. Very GJ.
Was anyone possibly thinking about jjk when the second coming entered the circle?
This is the most fun I had watching a math video since Cyberchase!
After watching im still not understand math 😅
This video gives sooo much nostalgia from time I spent at University. And with this music in it, it hits like a truck. So many memories. Math wasn't my favourite subject at University, but it's certainly nice seeing all these mathematical equations and functions all over again (with action and fun in the video of course). Wish there were derivations and integrals as well. Maybe in part 2??? 😋  Anyway, 10/10 this video. You're an incredible animator. You can teach something with this video!
It's really awesome
Me when i see this video:😮
Epic
Those MFs thought that math can't be cool
Now we know that math can be a weapon
1+1=11😂👏👏👏
My poor Brain can't even compreheind this
I am at a loss for formulas to describe how awesome that was.
How asian parents think about the game you play:
When i saw this it said it was uploaded 3 mins ago and like had no viewr Ers i could have been the first viweri think
it is a shame I have but one like to give.
This is the very first , strange and incomprehensible animation from Alan becker
Me when I does a math test before sleep
WOW
I watched the live at my tv. My iPad is lowbet so I watched it in tv
Nice video, i loved it. Ps. Can you make an animation vs. Science video too? I'll love it.😊
Why is there numbers in math
I learned more math in a 14 minute video than 10 months of school.
This helps me a lot as a visual learner
I+I=IO 😎
No 2+2=22 1+1=11
Вот так создали математику
Nobody cares about Joe Biden 😂
my math teacher: math is simple math:
Math just became real interesting
Who would've thought that math could look so badass.
If math lessons were like this, math would for sure be everyone’s favorite subject
Oh my brain
Teacher: this exam isn’t hard. The exam:
the sound design in this is mesmerising
Salam indonesia
this shi goes hard
2:56 Huh. I was totally expecting that to create a black hole or something.
I don't understand, but It's interesting😂
The game you make is the best-selling game after Minecraft
They really have to fight everything right? As a math lover, i lover this like Hell
typical movie
please make a game
Bro just explained 6th year
I stopped understanding at 6:22
My brain just commit suicide
Imagine if this was a game or a multiplayer game. It would be awsome fighting euler then winning the game or fighting aleph as a secret boss or something.
Довольно интересная история) мне понравилось :}  I liked this video >:}
I don't knew that's number pi is cos and sin.
holy flipping crap!
I think the giant blast was a bit too powerful. That’s a joke, son.
It's delightful
You made me wanna study math. Thanks!
1+1=2
when you have no wifi so you open calculator
Basically, What Math's does inside our brain cells.
My Brain hurt beacuse of this i know is 1+1=11
1:38 Even I was surprised!
No it’s 21
low-key entertaining
The superior animation
This dude explained math in 15 minutes while my math teacher couldn't explain it in 5 years.
Best animation forever
Is that aleph 0
This almost made me like math
Wow.
bro............... how is orange not some supermegagigachad god of the real world yet tho also i know know wh it takes sooooo long for you to upload you will forever be forgiven.... just as long as you keep supplying us with the new power's orange and his friends have
Now TSC is the smartest one in the universe
1:00 red:WHATTHEHALL yellow:Orange? green:THATS LONG blue:ORANGE CHILL orange:Blue i aint chillin
This is why kids that hate Math should go watch this video.
The power of math can make you fast think crazier and powers? potentially I will dream that it's real in the future I hope cos this too cool. who agrees?
an incredibly exciting adventure, Alan you are amazing keep making these fascinating animations they inspire and give meaning to life
watched your videos, forgot about it, then saw this on my reccomended. as always, love your videos.
i hate math
Bro made me understand math better than my teacher
He's going to divide by zero, isn't he?
8:30 is jus amazing
Part2!🙇
very good Video you can make about Math a full Marvel Movie!
I want more PLEASE
I love how Aleph got a cameo!
i- there smarter then me
The craziest part of all of this is that I vaguely recognize the concepts being used from my algebra classes back in high school.
Hay lắm
TSC is a Master of the MATH😂😂😂😂😂
I don't know what's going on here. idk math
I expected everything, but this time Alan Becker surprised me
1+1= 2
Bro this thing is AWESOME i cannot expect a YOUTUBER made a such content like this
When your math teacher can't get the bored kids to listen so he pays alan becker to teach us.
beatiful
POV: my mind in an exam
seems we can make a game like this.
You can see that at 13:14 that's a singularity.Not only they just ruptured the space-time barrier to create a stable wormhole (which you can travel in time,or to other dimensions,or even travel through the multiverse),but before that TSC just solved gamma function.Unbelievable.Good job Alan!
I feel like eating my sock. This is too good.
Okay this was very creative good job Alan
1 + 1 is 2
С каких пор легально делать такие крутые ролики по МАТЕМАТИКЕ?) Я уже раз пятый пересмотрел и оно не надоедает   А и я не представляю , что такое число Эйлера , я знаю , что оно существует и вылезает где попало  , но дальше пары производных и того , что это основание натурального логарифма я не знаю , ну и мнимые числа я знаю только в виде концепта
3+12÷6×(1×2)=?
This is absolutely phenomenal. One of the best videos on the internet hands down. I'm sure this video apart from being a piece of art and entertainment will also spark the desire to learn math. Alan - once again you and your team did more than absolutely amazing job. Thank you for everything. If you could of course... I (probably not only me) would really be happy to see animation vs physics or animation vs chemistry <3
Finally a vid after millions of years dude
Nobody: Nothing My relationship with math:
Why couldn't he catch e^iπ?
Just baggy his 0 iq 1+1 is 2 easy😂😂
this is satisfiying for no appperant reason
Animatorom vs math 2 ???
That's a fun way to learn math 🤔
I dont know if i had gained or loss brain cells
Literally me on my calculator when I'm bored 😅
Rumours say that TSC hasnt been seen for 72 minutes
This is amazing!!!
MATHEMATICS BOI
12 out of 10, epic + learned math fast + noita sun + omega sun blast  + god tier animation
If 1+1=11 soo 1-1=-11?
The best math video on the internet. ❤🔥🔥
missed opportunity to put 9+11=21
Pov. My maths copy last papper
My math skills inside my head :
my e38
worries 1+2=?
25+25 =60
alan can take such random things and make the best animations out of them
*Brain.exe has stopped working*
I love 69
Damn, that's more than good, bc i understand with this video mre than learning and teachings in school
second coming 200iq
U DOM?
Anthony padilla needs to do a video with Alan now
I said bros got a death star, and then he started lasering E     Prediction 1000
Geht auch nicht mehr so viel zu tun und ich
Me a bio student don't know what's happening but enjoying it🗿
Absolutely insane! There's so much details in this!
who else thought they were here to watch for only a couple of minutes
Pie
Bro flexed his 3Blue1Brown knowledge on us
I guess we need math after school...
The real question was, How did orange get here in the 1st place?!
Bro had enough and built a mini death star at around 10:41
“Dont look behind you” is pretty much the answer
I ain't readin allat.
11:45 I may be wrong but second comming is adding {e`iπ } with +5 Wouldn't e`iπ turn into 4  Like e`iπ = -1 Soo e`iπ + 5  -1 + 5  = 4
This feels like stark tech
I want wanted episode 2
i dont have a fucking clue what happened, but it was hella cool
Very gud
Alan when he plugs a TI-84 plus into his computer
orange learning math cool
Me in every math exam be like :
TSC learning match in a fun way lol
I love matn and your stickmans. I am from in Uzbekistan
bro yhat's crazy
Ok now do Physics and Chemistry !
1+1 = ??
never knew math could go THIS HARD 💯💯🔥🔥
animation vs. code
Bro learn math in 14 min💀💀💀💀
The power of math
Animation vs the periodic table next?
E😢
r=10  10x10 = 100  r=100  radians gets bigger
This is over off the best videos I have ever seen. I absolutely love it!
thanks for posting a great video
no is 2
The ultimate power of math
7:45 wow!
now do Animation vs. Science >:D
:v from a simple number to everything in math
I have phobia in math😢
1+ 1 is 11 but 1+1= is 2
Next : Animation vs. English
Alan just teaching everyone math in 14 minutes while school takes 12years amazing animation like always
2024: animation vs science 2027: animation vs physics 2030:animation vs vr  (Virtual Reality) 2032:animation vs real life
Hey bro teleportation was discovered also with this video I wonder if you are trying to tell us this? (biliyrrum is very theoretical)
Quick mafs!
Hey alan. Pls make a game pls 4:50
😱😱😱😱🧡👍🧡👍
please tell me this is not the end of this, its so good
Hi
this is got to be the most amazing, interesting and fun animation to watch
this could be a live event in roblox
How to make math fun
We’re in the end times hahahahaha    Thats what they keep saying.
How have you managed to make math look cool
Math maniacs when they fight :
mexican + asian = INFINITY CHORES
I really loved it🎉. I suggest you make something like "Animation vs English"
this is why i love math
Knowledge is truly power
Alan please part2 video hipnotised me pls part2
I'm pretty terrible at math but damn was this amazing
😮😮😮😮😮😮
🧡😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
I hope for Animation vs Programming
As a mathematical lover, I can confirm this was cool.
1+1 is not 11 it's 2
My IQ after this video: 📈📈📈
Adam evrenler arası geçidi buldu bizim türkler aşk dizisi çeksin amk
You know how much I secrefist
this called the real play with mathematics 😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶
finally a good explanation of where advanced math comes in handy
The legend posted another video   Legend supporters 👇
Math has never been so cool
The End: 13:50
bro i want this to be a game so bad, i love this so much i can't even describe it
DAAAAAAAAMN
Dawg turned math into a whole nother level
Wow is cool
Next: Animation vs. Chemistry
That was pretty cool ❤😂
At 10:53 the second coming made a literal death star according to maths
omg thank everything e's friends came along.. i would have been devastated if it was left there alone😭
i will never forget that video is epic 🤓
数学をやっててもやっていなくても楽しめるのこの動画だけだろ
Everyone knows 1+1=0¹
E😭🧡😞
Now I am afraid of maths
Alan, I really love your videos! They have made me, someone who used to dislike math, appreciate the beauty of mathematics!😲 I hope to see more videos like Animation v.s biology in the future.🥰 Looking forward to your upcoming works!👍👍
—1—0—6×÷7——=1eiπ
Everyone know 1+1= window
1+1 2
1+1?
I love it. Even if I don't love maths. It's sooi interesting. I don't understand the 3/4 of the video but that's okay
wow amazing animation
Bro went to 1 + 1 to making a literal death star.
The most instructive video ı've ever watched
Nice videos Brooo
Never was I more invested in mathematical solutions than today. That was AWESOME HOLY DAMN!!!
Orange just taught us math better than my old math teacher going through a crisis💀
I just learned more in an math animation then a math lesson.
can we take a moment to appreciate how good that music fits in...?
5:35 bro drew perfect circle like its nothing💀
Show this to kids in kindergarden, and they graduate from harvert or something by the end of the video
Мужик даты харош молодец
The sigma ex transformation space  gun was sick
Be careful when you make e(i π)
Everyone knows 1 + 1 is …
The way Alan Becker adds all of this math equations is crazy and also interesting to watch
The song and action make it even better
5+5=55 no 5+5=10 yes
This is just Animation vs. Animator 1 all over again isnt it?
You can orange or (e) friend?
Even if you don't understand all of the nerdy math, this is still a really fun animation to watch
Bro is expert😊
Its been a while i have seen a video with actual tension to watch. Just awesome
Imagine if Collatz Conjecture was weaponized to force something into an infinite unescapable loop
If only math was this cool
Finally vidio
How is the background musics name?
the orange it have IQ 10000000000000000000000000000000
trippiest thing ive ever saw
i showed this video to my father that teaches me maths from time to time and he was amazed
This is my favorite video on YouTube now
Very understandable! ... But interesting
階乗はどこ？
This so fire🔥🔥 Alan Becker
10+9=21
This animation: "Let him COOK"
This shi teachin me better than my teacher
Still fighting is better than boruto 😂😂
E
You could make a series of animation vs math
one day a teacher's gonna use this as some sort of math example to their students and try to quiz them on what's actually happening in the video
This video make me realise that math is actually fascinating
Amazing animation, even though all that math stuff I did not understand because I am only in 5th grade.
After seeing this video, my IQ to increase by 35 IQ, Thank you! :)
t + h + e + e + n + d = TheEnd
You forgot capital pi or pi function
1+1=2
pls more math vidéos like that
how can a literal stick figure learn math quicker than me. ive never felt more humiliated
Bro rlly had to think hard making this animation💀
Типичный твой мозг во время матеши
What 1÷0
1+1= 10 in binary 💀
orange=elbert einstaint
10:02 legendary battle cry from our main man Euler himself.
Everyone knows 1+1 is 11.
Alan you destroied your mint
As math nerd I confirm this video is correct math (I think lmfao)
TSC is literally smarter than me
Explain in Minecraft terms
I never thought I would be entertained by math
Alan made me not hate letters in math because whatever I just witnessed was the greatest thing my eyes will ever see
The tariff ı want to apllly to mathematics
Terkoiz really knows how to chew them numbers
Bro Taught me more than i learned in School💀
No 1+1=3
Alan Becker managed to explain math from 1st to 11th grade in just 14 minutes
Minecraft haves an new Update can u make an animation from it❤
Я ещё никогда так интересно математику не изучала
Is it thou
You made my brain stop working
when a nerd makes a action movie
When you enter the wrong room, then ask until they are satisfied, then immediately ask the essence of the questions after they are answered, they leave🗿
I'm going to have to scroll through the comments to see what every visualization is!
so it found 1+1 and few minutes later suddenly he master dimensional transportation, just like what my teacher expected from me
this had made me actually interested in math, my most hated subject and im going to start watching videos on equations and different variables so i can understand all of math.
What?
Me not knowing what’s going on because I can’t do math
so this is a really convoluted way to proof that e^iπ = -1 (a.k.a euler's identity)   also, what is that giant thing at the end?
You could just use factorials such as 100! And then derive an answer for us
I like how easy u make it
thx
People pls listen this is damn important.i want alan and his team to coperate with a game company and create a game out of this concept.Just imagine a game having a great story, journey, visuals and most importantly math.This game could be revolutionary,it can change the whole perspective of maths.Pls i request you to like this comment and share this idea to make this game concept real pls🥺
THATS COOL BUT MY HEAD HURTS
i feel like this could be TSC kinda thing cuz im pretty sure hes the only stick figure without one cuz blue is potions red is animals yellow is tech and building green is blocks but whats TSC thing
It felt like some indie game :") love it
❤(-:
noita gameplay be like
Alan becker how you make things like this?
The big one in the end was Aleph (א), the biggest number ever
Pov you knew all the eqn ☠️
It is 2
This is sick good job 👍
I have never studied math so much lol
21 HOURS #5 ON TRENDING
is easy 1+1 is 8392T
wtf man thıs ıs perfect
Вот на что способно, ВЫСШЕЕ ОБРАЗОВАНИЕ
This is epic
as an asian, i approve
10:32 It felt like he was creating the BFG10k 😂
Wow, it's look so good
If alan becker made this animation of math means hes good at math
ℵ  aleph null
My master Alan. You shall teach me the ways of these animations. Or else I must slap myself.
1+1_2-0
3 y/o me trying to do 1 + 1
I wish i can make a video as good as you guys in the future
Never thought math would be this interesting
Who knew maths could be fun
outstanding
12:24 spells "Exit"
In a different perspective we can consider this is an example for how fast AI learning
This is the right way to deal with math!
Oh my gosh the beautiful imagination it takes to make something like this.
I love the creativity on this video
more then half the vid I didn't understand anything
I very love this episode <3 🙂
And the fact that I knew every single equation that he did tells me that I am the real math nerd
Why am I learning more math here than school
3 × 3 is 6 100 %
The presentation was too goood and acurate
This is going to help SOMEBODY, I just KNOW it! All these visualizations are VERY cool!
My God!!! No one here knows that  1+1=10 And 1+1+1=11
Mathematics is eas-
imagine the math vs the dark lord who would win?
The second Alan makes this a website/game, all other calculators are going out of business.
Bro taught me maths better than school
Ahh so this is how I was supposed to use math in real life my sixth grade math teacher wasn’t lying after all
I think I stopped understanding at around 8:29 , I think that's a function
next programing math please thi is so cool you are the best animator I know
I've never thought Math could be this fun and interesting. Very good job!
1+1=3
TSC just went from basic math to calculus in less than 20 minuges.
I calmly solve the example at the blackboard What's going on in the world of mathematics
I understand nothing but i apreciate the animation (sorry for my bad english)
Great.
Teacher: How you suddenly sooooo good at math? My Bros: Yea dude how you suddenly soo good? Me: Oh go watch Alan Becker videos
2:49 STOP DONT DO IT
oh I think you dropped this "S" hear have it back. There now the title is fixed.
Whenever i see maths suddenly my brain stops 😂
Alan is an ultra math genius or he has a very good calculator
Cool, i never see math animate like this
Happy ending ;)
Bro was really winning a fight with the rules of math like damn
7:00 is that much i know👀
Best animation ever 😀
Bro really fought with math
ЕМААААА ЭТО ШЕДЕВР ИЗ ШЕДЕВРОВ КОТОРЫЕ Я ВИДЕЛ!
bro explained math in animation terms
never thought it was possible to fight math  Edit: Why are all of Alan becker’s animations are so good?
1+1is 2
9:57 神獣ジュケ・ンセイに巣食う 数のカースガノン
The+End=part 2
This shows how smart orange is
🤷‍♂
It’s crazy how big and mysterious and magical world of math is
Wow Watching this hie made my day
No 1+1 it 2 dummy
4:42 I like how when they were fighting with -1 and +1 swords, the number 0 appeared with every clash
E为什么折磨恐怖，有知道的吗
we need part two with all the Animation vs. Math
Что у меня творится в башке во время ОгЭ по математике:
I learned more than how my teacher teach
This is a (person who studied math his whole life)'s imaginary
Good job Alan Becker 👍👌
And they said my Maths knowledge would never be useful in the real world. Well, I guess it wasn't a Real world, more of a Complex one.
Nahh bro took math is life to another whole level 💀
Yo I've been waiting the next episode of animation vs agents
Animation vs coding next 😂
Alan kapan uppeload vidio baru dari Alan yang wanted vs animination
I read the title as "Animation vs. Meth". And thought 'damn this gonna be crazy'.
one of your best videos thanks and please keep on doing that
Wow
nah im confused
Так вот как выглядит защита диплома инженера!
Next chemistry plz❤❤
I learned more from this video than school
This your video is very good
This is a stellar masterpiece!
Only there is a question, first of all, how did the stickman get there? Secondly, what happened to him? Was it just deleted or was it deleted and it already appeared on your computer? Or just a dream?
math power
This thing explains the whole concept of mathematics much better in an easy and accessible way than 9 years of study 🗿💧
This was amazing!! I’d love to see more animations like this plz☺️
Lezgo
Next: Animation vs physic
Amazing video!
I didn’t understand anything after like the first five minutes, but damn if that wasn’t impressive
pleas part 2
RUSSIAN Г! 13:02 THIS IS REALY
Now way is this another series 👇 For Alan to make a new series
5:50 tsc:- hello students today we will calculus
Better explanation than my math teacher
This guy just make me love mathematics.
i love math but now more
Math in 14 min
This can possibly be a better math lesson for us lol
pls do animation vs undertale
This went from a math lesson to a boss fight with the scariest battle cry * waaaaaah* like a baby 😂
In Ohio
Ф+б
What's the name who killed sc
That was fantastic. If only i could understand all that math..
Y'know my daughter didn't mind math but was kinda blah about it. NOW? Now she thinks it's badass and wants to learn about every formula this video has. Thank you for letting your math nerd animator do this and I hope you plan to make more
This a damn masterpiece
1+1IS.2.NOT11
"I bet you can't make math cool in just one video." -One of Alan's friends, probably.
i have a maths exam tmr lol
still contemplating how math could turn into a zombie apocalypse
now I’m remembering that my math was bad.
After this video, everyone will love match (➕➖✖️➗)
¡Qué gusto ver este video! ¡Muchas gracias!
Why do I understand this, than my math teacher
1+1=2
1+1=2 ez😂
Make another animation the name of the animation is animation vs letters
9:46 here’s why I’m scared of math sometimes
Can you do animation vs astronomical?
We need someone to make a breakdown video of this. At my current capacity I can only understand so much.
Who is the giant at the end?? 😅😅😅
Huh
A game of star wars mixed with math mixed with Alan becker
Я узнал ВСЮ математику за 14 минут
as a (past) math major, i can confirm these equations are actually on point (from euler formula to schrodinger equation) and also LOVE the way you guys visualize all these mAdNeSs (trust me, this is why i totally gave up on math) Great details as usual Alan! :)  ok i know i sound nerdy but heck
Man tsc can beat Goku now
And this video shows how maths is interesting...
Alan becomes my maths teacher now 😢
С этого ролика я узнал больше чем с урока математики
Damn the new Star Wars movie leak lookin great
1+1=11 bro
Math lessons be like =
is not 11
Math has left the chat
That was so cool, i can't imagine how you made this😮
Hi Alan what program do you use for animation?
Finally u uploaded a video i missed your videos
1 + 1 = Eleven o Clock
No is 2 not 11
a
Bro make up your minds its ez its 2
Even a stickman is smarter than me :(
Bro turned math into a movie
Hello (person). In this empty room is an infinite amount of numbe- wait, what are you doing. Stop fricking playing with them! I haven't even explained the trap! SLOW THE FRICK DOW-
What is 9+10 ?
I'm a sucker for maths, and aleph at the end just made my brain happy
1+? = ? :))
Any topic but this school just finished
I really needed this to feel better about my math homework+-x÷😂
As someone who is currently learning integrated calculus and Euler's identity, I love how accurate the math is!
10:00 scream
хотим продолжение!
I like that video
Now try sheet music animation
I gotta show this to a friend who hates maths
21 h
Это просто шикарно.  Больше мне нечего сказать.
1 + 1 is 2
I'm very not genius  (I not speaking English . I speaking Russia ) Ааааа я очень тупой для этого.😠
2:05 gonna get me in trouble 🥴
The only thing alan becker and his team can make is masterpieces thank you alan for being apart of this Comutaty
1+1=2
the fact you made art with only mathematical digits and symbols baffles me...... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Bro learnt all of math in 14 minutes while it takes 13 years for us. Bruh.
wow... it looks like i'm in the school learning math, and then get the knowledge the university
its the best your video🤩🤩🤩🤩
Это супер классный ролик
1+1=2
Math its hard
Don't know how many people noticed this quick detail, but i'm so happy that you do it.   So in the multiplication section, the visual shows how multiplication actually works, how things like 3 x 4 is actually three fours, and not four threes, 6 x 2 is six twos and not two sixes, and so on. Something that many people (in my experience at leaat), even math teachers, seem to misinterpret, and even insisted its the other way around.   As a big fan of math,  appreciate that a lot, and i feel really validated in my belief of that simple, almost trivial concept.
Bro made math look EPIC!!!
Probably 1+1 is 2
This is beyond my understanding! Wauw ❤
Bro, not only should this video be an oblation to math, but it also teaches the history of humanity, or at least weapons, going from swords with numbers to laser beams at the end, cinema
I did like half of the video in my head as it all made sense. Anything after i (minus pi) became difficult!
This give me major Troy Legacy vibe. Don't know why, maybe the music?
next : Animation vs Alphabet
Hurts my brain while watching
2
it came out 20 hours ago and I already want part 2 lmao
make new part plssssssss
The + end = to be continued.
Bro just started a war for no reasons
The best movie 2023
nhức nhức cái đầu
крутое видео
"The test won't be that hard" The test:
bro morphed into a math teacher
it scream 10:02
Orange becoming master in math in 5mins Mfs learning math in 16 years:😡😡😡
That was Amazing
After watching this clip, I don't understand the math you brought.
👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Animasyon vs aminator
Now everyone knows that an empty head does not mean that it is stupid.
nice
Animation vs undertale
WHAT THE ACTUAL FU-
Alan minha materia preferida e matematica 😅
Nahhh i fricking Love This‼️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥
I hate math
The video proves one thing: math is too hard to understand
good job 🤯
I NEED MORE

1+1 -        100
Ju
It was very helpfull now i can understand maths a bit
My man really put so much emotions into numbers and made them more badaas weapons then anything else. Wow. I understood NOTHING ( im weak at maths) but i enjoyed it whatsoever. Props to the whole team!
Never thought maths could be THAT FUCKING EPIC. ALAN IS A GENIUS
Io esigo una reaction da @favij come ai vecchi tempi
Everyone knows 1+1 is 111
math becomes a game  this is the trailer
Now I know my mind is not filled with things I will never use in my life, I use it to watch this
A legend is back.
teachers shouldve made us watvh this masterpiece
Pls make more of this
I can imagine so many schools using this animation
Hey Alan! I was wondering if you could make this a series with Eulers formula and the second coming travelling through different dimensions(other subjects) to correct an error in the subject matrix? It would be awesome and i will wait as long as i would have to for your uploads
Waiting for phisics and E=mc²
I’m not a math nerd. This makes me want to be one now. This looks so cool
The math apocalypse
Jenius😂
all the 2nd graders on 1:38 left the chat
As a autistic person who enjoys math, id say this is whats in my mind when i think of math.
o my god, amazing video
and you so creation
5:47
Then again, of course my comment is ignored, the man @Alan Becker decides to make an uncanonical and unrelated animation to the Animation VS Animator VI series, how long is this gonna continue?
Im sorry but my brain is too fishy to understand this
This is something albert einstein would call "a challenge" Cause its kinda hard to understans
World calculator?
That was very creative!
0:28 Ayo
Yoooo this is sickkkkk
hats off alan becker kkep up this good work i wish u all the best !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! '
anjim ga gerti gua mtk nya tapi ani.asinya kerin 👍👍👍👍👍👍
When does animator vs animation 7 come out
The fight represents my 2 left brain cells during an exam
gua yang ga bisa mtk belike 🗿
bro know how to make a perfect circle🥲
This is my math lesson now
This is blowing my Mind 🤯
Bro took "I can make math more fun!" to a whole godamn level of intensity of a heated battle! 😲
He has returned
the way that alan & the animating team utilise the maths concepts in the battles whilst maintaining all the mathematical rules is what makes this animation so unique and epic like the railgun from the sine & cosine waves all the way down to the bow made of the 2x2 shooting 4s also the sound design was great
😎2dang
8×8÷8 is 8
Can you have part 2?
This man just showed how some students are fighting with math😂
...I learned more from this video then I did from my entire math course at school.
bro wth am i watching this is insane bro
My math teacher 10:00
nice
2
Me at the beginning: wow, this is cool Me half way through: *w h a t  i s  t h i s*
The Aleph Null just made me smarter that I looked on it at the end
how do you do so good animations (IT saa hard to write cause cause i Have auto correct)
this is what i think of in math class
A math= shooting game 💀
Coolest math animation I have ever seen
Never in my wildest dreams could i have ever imagined second coming going against e
Yeah
No its  2
My brain hurts
{*-*}
Khan Academy and Alan Becker crossover be like:
Orange learned math in 14 mins  more than I can in 14 years- 😭
Orange do be really turning into the next Albert Einstein😂
I bet the seguel of this Will be animation vs geometry
*Watching  youtube after 1 day tired of math* Youtube:
That one time math is fun. ☠️
Я всё узнал о математике в этом видео 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I want this theme ALWAYS
TOATALLY 1+1 IS 11
me duele la barrigita
I have a bunch of theories now. Like what if orange was out here by those internet police 🫢
Can you make Animation vs. Science
What possessed you alan to make this?
Alan의 '애니메이션 VS  [       ]  ' 시리즈에는 늘 무생물에게 생명을 불어넣어서 주는 재미와 감동이 있는데 이번 수학편에서도 물론 매번 느끼는 감동과 재미가 있었지만 별개로 어렵고 지루하다고 생각했던 수학이 주제임에도 엄청 집중해서 시청하는 나 자신을 보고 Alan에게 대단함을 느꼈습니다. 영상을 다 본 뒤에 댓글을 통해 오일러의 등식을 알게 됐는데 유튜브를 통해 오일러의 등식을 알려주는 영상까지 순식간에 보고나니까 이 영상을 한번더 틀어보게 되었습니다. 오일러의 등식이 메인 캐릭터인것이 정말 잘 어울린다고 생각합니다.
Now bro is soo smart 👏
I never thought that mathematics could be so fun
this belongs in a movie theater
Alan Becker, the only known person to weaponize math...
13:27 what happened?
1+1= =
Now, would this be TSC's new power? Something like green's singing power?
It says that1×1×1is ei pie but it's 1
You just outdid your self
DANH!!!
Someone wonder how Alan can make stickmen looks amazing well jokes on u he made MATH looks amazing!
hi animation vs animator VI ep 2!!!!!??!!!
If only math was like this...
#5 ON TRENDING!
Math just became a shooting game.. 🤣
1+1=2
I want to see more math war video like this
Very good alan
School: tries to teach math in the span of 12 years and some of the math barely sticks with us* Alan: haha math in 14 mins
Cos and sin plays a major role in mathematics
Wow... Astonishing Totally love it
Can't believe I am 20 hours late
the big later was א?
Imagine if Math is easier than everything else.
Meth
Bro is the one who invented maths
Awesome ❤❤
d4c
1+0=1
do din bad yo minecraft gb kya he nice
TSC discovered the entire realm of calculus in under 15 minutes, seriously one of the coolest parts was when the Euler monster derived from e caught the shot infinity in a limit, and using the 0-∞ integral, that seriously was like a woah moment  Another thing i dont see anyone pointing out is aleph null as a behemoth due to it being the smallest infinity, i loved every bit of this, its my third time rewatching
As a math nerd, I really enjoyed this video.
8:16 AND 9:54 AND 10:34 scene was epic, though the whole thing is aother masterpiece   MATHS IS STRONG
that was perfect
We want it's sequel
Loved this video by heart and lets just put this small action movie into trending
I cAnt even under stand most of the numbers because im in yr 5 i lost a few braincells i dont mean it in a nega5ive way
good ending
That was a realy coooooool video you are the best
Bro Alan why you gotta force me to remember my least favorite subject in school
Finaly i hate math animation is gona win!
That not math that is Wars
this is so incredible!
Animation vs phycs
Yes, I hate math. But not this channel.
Q
But... 1+1=0.
Imagine math was this fun...
Bro made math 1000000 times more fun
Cada ves que Alan Becker sube un video me sorprende mas
10:02 WAUGH
Its really cool video
by far 10:34 was one of the best scenes here
i find this satisfying Like lofi or ASMR
Very amazing
I bet This Video Took him alot of time
Just Amazing!!!! Want next part . Maybe you can add physics too!
I learn more math from here than in school...
the big one is aleph
that was like a movie
Just in 20 hours u reach 3,5 million view, i miss u so much
Bro this vid is smarter than vsauces entire youtube career💀
😎+💪
Math explained in 14 minutes
🤯
Bro if you make a game I'll play till morning really please make a game
My dude orange loves math it seems
Nice animation dude, ive been watching you since 3 years now and you never dissapoint me :)
Damn that is inspired! Amazing!
When two smart students fight over the correct answer for 15 minutes before the bell rang but in the end they solve it together  Me at the back of the class: " So... can I go home? "
I think 99% of the audience just understood the beginning part. (including me ) 😅
If Math was like this, I would have fun
Everyone knows 1+1=?
Now I wonder how much a math had to be done to make this video
when the math teacher ask:can you explain this?                                 (∞+Ω)?
Woah orange become eyestye
nice
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.
11 лет математики выучил за 14 минут, збс, ну и нахер я тратил время в школе
Skibidi skibidi skibidi
This is how they should teach math in school
Brr skibidi dop dop dop dop yes skibidi dop
Who knew math could be this entertaining?
Omg this so complicated my mind is amazed and at the same time confused 🤣
It's the most epic thing I've seen!)
Oh look! Finally, I reason for me to have taken trigonometry!
What's 9+10=21 😅
This is the greatest animation I ever seen in my life !
2 math god 1v1
That's who created the math
imagine this was if   math was thought
Now i really want to learn Maths to understand this stuff.
This is my brain while doing math- 🥲
wait those signs... What if ye uses math symbols in animator Vs animation PT 2?
Alan your animations are super crazy! I love them. Thanks you for explaining my math teacher when i dont do my homework 😢
10 out of 10 😂
1+1=2
Math is always fun with aminations
bro the laser just eveporated him bro
Orange should use math in his head in that vid where he gets captured he uses like some chalk that just randomly appeared and makes the same formula that he makes a portal to the math dimension to plan their attack.  Cool idea right.👍
Its incredible that this team can make an intresting and intregiung video about just solving math, truly an incredible video
He's smarter than me:(
10^6=1000000
Wow that was... intricate.
Now we all know orange have better iq then us.
While watching this i got best way to calculate now...
He's so powerful he doesn't learn math. This is math learning
you described half of my future depression💀
I KNEW MATH WAS EVIL!!!
1+1 actually can equal 11 if we're using the unary numeral system. Like tally marks.
i = √-1, i²= -1 , i³ = ie power of iπ = -i, i⁴= 1
I can't stop watching this
Plaseeeeeeeeeeee math vs animation 2 😢
1+1= too hard :(
watching the video made me want to make a game with this theme))
.... now you know why I'm traumatized my math ...
My poor small brain hurt just watching this vid, but great vid Alan
MathSSSSSS
The solutions shown there were done by us in our statistical.
that animation is so MiND BLOWiNG!
alphabet lore? nah bro  MATH LORE
bro just completed the whole math lore
1+1=2👌
'2' + '2' + '2' = 20
thats me vs math
🗿👍
Alan you gotta become a math teacher ain't hell no this animation it ain't teaching me
13:45 wtf is that
WOW YI LOVE YOU
1+1=2
All people knows 1+1=2
Alternative title: Mathematics In14 minutes
❤❤❤
After 7 years, Finally something new !!!!!
Wow Nice Animation👍👍👍
Where was this in my childhood
1+1=2
I want to see versions of other subjects, not just mathematics. For example Japanese, science, and so on.   Maybe my sentence is wrong because I'm Japanese. Sorry🙇‍♂.
The perfect visualization of trying to solve calculus, right here
That's great ❤🎉
Matematikle bu kadar uğraşmak çok iyi baya beyin gerektiriyor
amazing how i can understand every thing
The journey of maths which we need to survive til the end
only Alan and his team can make me think math is wholesome and cute at the end.
Hey Alan I showed your channel to my mom and she said this is the best thing I have ever shown her.
Oh nooo my enemy #1
cool, now do it in base 8
I know this is gonna get crazy in the fiture
WTF  🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠
what if they combined so many numbers thet they create infinity
Animation vs Math part 2 please!
We need a part 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!
İt's Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Perfect
O c'mon even when watching YouTube wtf I can't escape
Nunca pense que las matematicas eran tan divertidas
I Love You Terkoiz
when I do math exam my brain like that
Animator vs Animation VII please release date
RETURN OF THE KING
Actually alan is using calculator and calculate it before animating 😅
So, the point of this video is that you can become a math expert after fighting numbers, English, sword fights, gun fights, and even war, right?
Sebagai bang
6
If this was how math was taught, I would always pay attention and eager to learn
no @just_baggy everyone knows 1+1 is... 2!
just wait until he figures out what desmos is
bro become albert einstein💀
good
Cool + video= i like it
Bro i wanted to learn some math. And its turns into transformers movie wth
It's just a masterpiece
As an 11 years i now understand what is cos,sin.. what is work of them in calculator
can this be a video game
the music and creativity in this is mind blowing!
When you doze off during a test:
Who knew math could’ve been this interesting!
Ain't know no maths... I'm fantasizing
The ending is proof for next episode of animation vs math for sure.😀😀
Bro getting smarter like Albert Einstein
De hacer operaciónes a crear una estrella de la muerte.
If only math was this fun…….
Someday i will understand all of this
When teacher is late by 5 minutes and tells You that You don't have much time left:
Masi hidup ke tak lah dah mati
Maths are EPIC.
Can you make a animation vs minecraft education edition
This video taught me things that I cant imagine
I think 100+99 is 99999 255 😊
So how many headaches did it take to finish the video.
Like a lucid dream of a math professor.  In a good way.
Epic! is best video ever.
I never knew math can be fun
19 hours，3.5m views, cool.
IT WAS AWESOME !!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I have no idea whats going on but its amazing
it's brilliant ❤❤❤
My dad just watched, and he said it was one of the best videos he’s ever seen
Is it a April prank
This... really made me feel like this is the Alan Becker's outstanding animation style I knew and grew up with. Don't get me wrong, I like the Minecraft animation series too, but this is really the next level.
Bro this never happened to my calculator 😭😭😭😭😭
OMG
i wish i could have learned math like this
holy moly this was awesome!
if only math teachers were as fun as this
Its shows That Math is the most hardest Subject.
We did it guys, math is no more
1+1 = 21 am i stupid
Math is power
This one is real insane!!!!
Это лучшее что я видел
Please do Animation vs baldi's basics please
I already love math, so this is just so awesome
The first time animation make me want to learn math
3+6+1=10
Bro made math emotinal
Math sure interesting but its too hard to understand ❤
The+End .D
This was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
1 + 1 = 2  *It's my life  is not available 😭 b.y.e😂*
Now I know all the math...
ABSOLUTE PERFECTION
WHAT ARE THESE BABBY STEPS TO HARD
I think i lost  my brain, you damaged it with math
Everyone knows 1+1=田
😅
Crazy creativity love ya hope you make 1.99999 Billion Dollars
As a math nerd, i can say that this was indeed satisfying
imagine mathing so hard you breaking the fucking math time space dimension barrier
I'm sorry but did bro just make a literal Math Death Star XD
11:26 Am I… correct in thinking that they just entered… the i dimension?
what a masterpiece
Okay, im stupid
This is when humans can understand the true nature of maths
this is the greatest animation yet
Моё уважение Алану, ведь для создания этой серии нужно знать высшую математику
What's 9+10?
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Orange has now become the most smartest figure 🔥
Do animation vs physics... It'll be awesome!
Is look best
I love mathematics...  this pleases me so 😁
Поэтому я ненавижу матиматику
I'm not that good at math, but why was there a giant Aleph at the end?
Whaaaattheeeeefffuuuuuuuuu-
My brain couldnt handle it
1+1=11
Everyone else in math class during elementary school: learning how to raise to the third power Me messing with the funny buttons of my calculator:
Animation vs math    *#44 trending on GAMING*
This sick 1+10=21
1+1 = 2
Mtk ilmu yg menyenangkan bukan 🗿
Just wait for the fan-made subtitles
Dude's playing "calculator" 💀
Are You going to make ,,Animation VS Doors"?
Orange is big brain
Orange learns a math concept and how it functions, and then that translates into some sort of combat ability after having summoned e^(i*pi), it gets away, Orange takes what they already have along side something new that they witnessed e^(i*pi) do to learn a new concept, and the cycle continues, I love it!
easy math
How did orange end up here
2+0 = 20. We are waiting. ANİMATİON VS CODİNG
I love this video❤
I like this one. I never being happily in the world of calculus like this before as a math nerd. And I like to see more such as Animation vs Physics featuring yellow as protagonist or Animation vs Biology featuring Red as protagonist or even Animation vs Chemistry featuring Blue as protagonist. What an idea come out of me hehe
Ok  1+1=3
I lost my math knowledge from the first minutes of the video💀
12:25 omg I'm so dumb HE'S TRYING TO SPELL exit
Alan Becker never disappoint us in his videos 😊❤❤
wow
THE BEST MOVIES EVER ON "Hi pictures"!!!
1+1=2
No it is 1+1=2
As math being my favorite subject, I can confirm that all of the calculations and equations in this video were valid. This video was EXTREMELY satisfying to watch for me.
My brain almost got fried trying to understand this
math in ohio
The moral we get, the smarter you are at math, the greater the possibility that you can rule the world.
Bro is more smarter than Albert Einstein 💀
Alan Becker is not only the best animator in the world but a genius too!!!!?????
I never knew how dangerous and scary math could be.
10:02 ,,WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!"
Proud of my math result
the last part was basically the i am not a moron meme from portal 2
Animation vs Math Pt.2
π  Cos 2× sin
When are you gonna release wanted 2?(I know there's a lot of pressure surrounding it but I really want to know)
my brain stop working😅
That was fire didnt understand half of it tho
this is fucking amazing bro <3
Hiroshima be like: 11:06
1 + 1 is 2
Man This made me want to study math again this was olso kinda funny becuase they used math as wepons
The visualization of the fraction also meaning division and showing the different symbols was kind of mind blowing. Allow me to explain, I'm Dyslexic and yes, I know how division works, but in those few frames it visually explained it far better then I could, and anyone else trying to explain it for me. It was weird, I already know what division is (god help me if I didn't) but the understanding was instant. Get what I'm saying?
From 1+1 to tearing a while between dimensions what else can this guy make
l feel sorry for him
I bet orange is an asian
Alph no
e
deserves Fields of course art part
god damn i understand now, the meaning math is fun is because my math teacher had to fight this thing and escape the math dimension
Correct
Alan I want a sequel! More Mathematical marvels like these! Ok? Becker?
1+1=112
1+1 is 1
So wery good ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Remove the sequels orange will survive
Bro 2+2 is 22 then
Even if I don't understand math and even if I suck at it and do not like the subject, that video is great. Thank you for doing that video.
Only a true genius can make math epic
So it's true a math is a monster😮😮😅
“I can’t breathe,” famous last words spoken by the drugged up pornstar. Floyd truly embodied the identity of a nappy hood rat who deserved to stay in chains.
Amazing sound design by the way. Your videos always have top notch sound and it's incredible!
Bro don’t tell me a youtube video abt math has more hype than hollywood movies nowadays 😂😂😂😂
This makes my math brain very happy, even with my math knowledge going up to year 1 calc I couldn't understand quite a bit of it, but it was shown i a relatively easy to understand way, albeit fast paced. 10/10
As a guy who is terrible at math and does not get along with the subject, I loved the crap out of this
The way my brain shut down 5 min in+to this
dog turned math into dark souls
sana ma kolung na ako
Fresh out of algebra 2, I understand… 1/2, maybe 3/5 of this. Might need a bit of a refresher from my books and a thorough analysis of this video to completely understand what’s going on, but I think I get the general gist.
IT'S FUCKING GREAT, PLEASE MORE
tsc is teaching me math better than my lastest math teacher
Ngl if I saw this in math class back in the day I’d pay more attention
Where king orange? I loved he so much
1+1 2
2×2=5
Ah yes, MATHEMATICAL DEATH STAR
what do you call that dot function? the f(•)
In conclusion me and my baby sisters IQ has increased
I am not sure why, but I was laughing at this hahahaha
The chosen has made friends everywhere including Math itself😅😅
Pov:what your brain thinks of when you have a math test
I learn high level math for 14min video 😅😂
my brain hurts
I’m not even at a stickman level 💀
Animation vs Time [could be time on the history]
Where is animator vs animation ep2
Это видео очень интересное
some people already doing some explinatio abt this
I love this animation, you combined two of my favorite things. Math and animations, love it, 10/10, hope you make more of this
I want to be free and I still watch the math thing 😢
Это я когда, математике питаюсь что-то выучить.
nobody: absolutely nobody: not a single soul:          My ADHD brain during math class:
This reminds me of the font battle animation :3
🤯🤯🤯
1+1=11 Yes
10:02 WAHHHHHHH
omg
Alan put all of his math knowledge from growing up from a asian family in one video
There was a certain point where i had to turn my brain off and just start trusting that the math was mathing
this is a really nice animation!

This was one of the most creative things i've ever seen
Never knew my Asian parent would like a animation video
Yo solo tengo una pregunta, a donde ha ido el naranja, que es ese lugar y quien era el e, yo pienso que es epsilon y si no es corrijanme porfa, nunca antes habia sentido tanto interes en las matemáticas y eso que me gustan.
I just dont know whats happening right now
Asian Parents in a 5 mile radius: GREAT ANIMATION
Эпичненько-математичненько)
what every math teachers do at home:
We all know that half of the viewers of this channel won't be able to finish the video or at least understand it:D
I don't wanna ask how or why but the fact that you made something awesome out of equations is unbelievable.
=f(*)
Math war
Nice
i'm not quite sure i understand that
One of the best animations I've seen to date, amazing job
Wow.........
Eeyeyeyue
He should put 9+10=21
0:08 0:11
This video single handedly made me actually like math
Do not go home until you finish reading the value of e
After watching this video I forgot math 😂
Ive learned more from this video than from 2 years of highschool lol
this animation is smooth af bro, love your animations been watching them since i was little
Short Course in Mathematics 11 years
THE BRAIN
My brain was just goin to explode 😵
that is me when im surviving math
Animation vs. Alphabet?
Man if they make math like this
i see this video 5 times
TSC is becoming smarter than King orange
epic
This is brilliant and should be taught on the first math lesson ever. 😂
is it good epic fight i never seen
speechless
i love how math is just god and i'm learning
VERY nice animation
This is very sweet.
For someone with low IQ like me, what the…
This will probably pop up in my head on tomorrows summative test
What I imagine and would probably draw in a calculus text book tbh
Sorry but I don't speak math
math will be needed in real life the situation :
I guess this video is informative. I learned many things from this video.
No it’s baby one
that was ABSOLUTLY AMAZING!!! <3
Alan can make an epic battle out of literally anything
I like this video😂😂
Mr. Becker has done it again! What a brilliant story. Makes me kinda jealous though because I wish I understood math. It's like I almost get it. I'm just on the cusp but not quite. I still remember when math became hard. It was like I hit a brick wall and I've never found away around it. Makes me sad.
When will you upload another video Alan
this video shows how to make an atomic explosion
I learned so much about this animation THAT DOESNT TALK
12:03
Plz Part 2
I- to much math 😵‍💫
Math lore:
Oh no. My worst enemy. Math.
The most interesting way to visualize math imaginable. Amazing!
2
9 + 10 = 21
I’m gonna send this to my math teacher
The atmosphere remind me Anti-Chamber. Mostly with this music. Wasn't entertained at all bc i don't understand math. But still interesting to watch
Это шэдевр
my brain after watching this video:  "I should have studied math to be this cool"
WTF, I DIDN't KNOW MATH WAS THIS EPIC. ALAN BECKER DOES IT AGAIN AND BLOWS US AWAY.
It's... wow...
ok but try understanding any of this at 2:30am (good luck)
cool
Everyone knows that 2+2=222
cool
this is so cool
10:39 super weapon
As someone who studied and recently graduated in Harvard university, I can remember all the terms Alan used for this video. (This is my cousins account and I don't understand what YouTube is but this is amazing.)
One word that describes this video is Epic
1+1=2 :)
This animation was first simple math and then a few minutes later, it was a whole dang anime lol
when u dont like math, just look  this video, is so cool
Bro turn symbols into guns
Cuốn
This is so educational and is teaching us
As a math teacher i can confirm that i will show this to my class
Bruh :0
Bro taught us everything in  maths in just 17 minutes.
12:28 e×¡T
I really like your animation And I am learning 😂
This guy has done the impossible. He entertained us with math
That's why they say maths is hard
what the f*** is going on im in fourth grade
the video was supposed to be called "teaching math in grades 9-11 in 14 minutes."
MOM : DON'T PLAY WITH MATH MY HONEST REACTION:
Grade 1 belike
I love how the math limbo look like with 2 word
Why he's on Math world? Where's ALANSPC?
This stickman went from school to high school
omg   is so mush mats
He is to smart.
wow man your so creative! i never thinking about an action animation about math! oh this man is genius!
For anyone who doesn't understand.              Don't worry I don't either 😆😂😭☠️.
Честно говоря, анимации Бекера самые эпичные, что я видел
alanbecker really made math fun
I love aleph null being the mystery character at the end shrouded in blur as it is a topic beyond calculus
Bros working a machine
this animation is amazing and its crazy.
me thinking if i should send this to my math teacher:
Star wars
a bit overkill 10:56
THE VIDEO IS REALLY IMPORTANT NO WAY ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Pasti susah ngedit nya
I like how from just very basic math it went to advanced
1+1=1
The last big letter א what was it doing there (it’s like A but in the Hebrew alphabet)
This is how I do my homework
who wants part 2
until 6:2(1+2) could be 1 (historical ref) or 6, PEMNAS/BOMNAS
Your math is so strong 😮😮😮😮
Me Vs maths
I liked the circumference part
04:40  I'll exorcise you, demon!
No wonder e^iPi is so dificult to find
2:47 this is why you shouldn't divide by 0 in stickman universe (sorry if I made made a mistake here, my English isn't really good)
godzila; boring king kong; boring math monsters; YASS QUEEN

tbh i think my brain is all fried up
4:41 they got the chosen one reference.
Your washing m.r beast
Do more
Several questions arise . . . What is this place? How did The Second Coming get here? Why is Euler's number so aggressive?
Why is orange on black world?
this is why I'm scared of math
I have never seen something so beautiful coming from math
This was way better than 99% of the movies that ive watched in my entire life
映画だなもうこれ
part 2 when
2+2= fish
My mind gonna be blown😮😮😮
man if this animation released early when im at my middle school i would have enjoyed math yk  (its not because im bad at it i was actually the top student and that math nerd of my class but i have never enjoyed solving math provlems xD)
❤️
Damn, 3Blue1Brown is really wildin’
My brain during a maths test:
What’s e^iπ
πr²=???
Everyone knows 15+15=thirty and 16+16 is thirty too
я просто посмотрел эту анимацию, но я снова заинтересован математикой
1 1
Not only you have made the entertaining animation involving maths in it, but it also shows the hard work you have done to study complicated maths. I have learned a thing or two from this
Every time I need to study for a math test I’m coming to this video
10:02 is the funniest thing in all timelines and all places of the universe, multiverse, metaverse
I just adore how squishy the math symbols are, and the “war cry” was so cute 10:02
I know 1+1 = 10 on binary
fake videos:  "cHoOsE thE RigHt aNsWeR"  real videos: "magic of math"
My brain made an error!
Mack one about stickman vs fortnite
This video is speaking cap though, 1 equals 2
You can only understand this video if you're a true math genius
If you watch this video 1000 times, you can become a doctor of mathematics
Hey guys 1+1=2 BOYYYY
This was really amazing! The music was awesome! Even though I didn't quite understand the math equations, it still was really cool to watch! I can already tell there will be a second video of this and I hope there will be a divide by zero plot or something. Maybe that could be the main antagonist who wants to destroy all of math or something haha!  Overall, this was one of the best animations I've seen in awhile, very creative, and amazing story telling
Mathematically accurate fight scene
i felt the schokwave of the first infinity shot
Yeahhh you lost me at the imaginary axis. I’m taking precalc this year so I’ll return with more training later
1 + 1 is must be  3.
1+1+5=7
1+1=2  1+1=11???
I'm sure teachers in the future will show this to kids for math
This is sick if orange friends is here
I thought that Orange is smarter than me this time.
me before watching video: 1+1 is 2! me after watching video: what the heck is math?
🤓 Thats all im gonna say
Bro, just make it equal 0!
IQ : ?????
Guys this is are best teacher so far! I understand 😮
Acabo de aprender matemáticas con esto?
aha so now you not gonna make ava for 3 years again?
math is boring "Alan" make it a fight n cool one
the best way to learn Math !!!!
So cool
Meme from the Philippines: 1+1= 11 o'clock
Only Alan Becker can make math this cool of a fight
How to make math fun
hey aland don't forget to make more episodes about the animation vs animator!! im waiting
he is going to go back to all his friends and be a mathematician
Wow,,, keren... sangatlah keren
Damn, didn’t know that math could be so strong
Goodness this goes though all grades of math, I wanna see a math teacher reacting to this.
animation vs alp
this is epic .....how does even people come up with these ideas ?? its way too cool  Loved it
just so you know, orange knew most of math in 13 minutes while it took you a decade
That's my favorite so far ❤😂😂
Episode 32: Cooking with blue
This must be the calculator richard was playing
Как всегда беспадомная анимация
Genius nya gak ngotak
I don’t know why, but I found this as the scariest video in the Alan Becker series. Maybe it’s just the music and how endless math can be.
i want part 2 where he will fight with Aleph 0
Isn't anyone gonna say that this went from 1st grade basic math to the college level of Algebra, Geometry, Calculas and Diffrential equations?
u would think orange wouldn't be the one doing all this with his lazy background of sleeping all the time
2😂😂😂
I like e :)
bro how did he get there to begin with?
Breaking the fourth dimension?
Bro just solved math in 14:02 minutes💀 and me solved math for 1 year💀(im not kidding I solved math for 1 year)
idk much abt sound design, but whatever you guys did, you nailed it. everything just sounded so satisfying to listen to
He explain a whole math in 14 minute, while our teachers 11 year
まて、なんかサラッと現代論超越 してね？
It's Amazing.❤
The scream is cute ngl 10:02
Math teachers, there is officially a better use of math than "Spiderman beat Dr. Strange with it."
Reqatched this like 8 times. A masterpiece to feed my art nerd and math nerd inner self
finally i know what goes on inside a calculator
Math is my favourite 😊
Addition Subtraction Multiplication Division Inequal sign Fractions (all parts) Decimals (all parts) Pemdas Parenthesis Positive Negative Square root Algebra X Y Z Quadratic equations Linear scale (Thats all I know)
hey Alan whats the song name please
This whole animation makes me wanna imagine a series where people have access to a calculator dimension they can jump in where they can experiment math all they want because the whole realm accurately autocalculates everything they play with. And the storylines tackle about math as a logical concept contrasting the main characters being emotional humans who happen to have a fascination interest with math. And the fight scenes just being eyecandy for mathematicians like this video.
Can we agree that Alan is just showing off?
This is actually so interesting to me! I loved how creative your team is! I myself am a big math nerd so I loved seeing all the math bits I haven't used in a while! Leave it up to y'all to bring this kind of quality all together! Looking forward to y'all's next vid!
At the end in the background there was a huge stick figure on the left
Bro the music behind this whole video just screams Neil deGrasse Tyson
This is so creative, these animations keep getting better and better
At 9:52 that part reminded me so much of a transformer, I loved that part of the animation
quien mas no entendio en la parte de las diviciones?
ive never been so confused in my life
The portal that orange is going at the end is Astronomy 😎
Pls part 2
1+1=2
Та самая 25 задача из огэ
4:00 pi omg
if you meet a dude saying math isn't cool. show this vid to them.
As a math teacher, i will certainly use that to teach kids!
Я надеюсь что эта серия повлявляет на сюжет
Or window
Cooll we need more vids like this alan becker
Urur video is so coooll❤🎉 i love it and it give me a lilebit of math
I just learned more math in a stickman animation video than in 7 years of school. This timeline is wild ngl
8:31 does anyone know what this transformation is about, with the half-arrow above the function sign?
Still curious on how The Second Coming even got there.
Now we want the alphabet !!!
Bro this is fucking insane pls make more and I wa really hoping you wouldn’t make the numbers into weapons and you delivered perfect animations as always I will never unsub
bruh math in this video is more like infinite magic, even you can create a death lazer out of math in that video lmao.
1:49  it  went into the complex world right?
As a math teacher, i say thanks!
@nihongomantappu
I look stuip
One small detail that i love is that when SC tries to divide by zero the music turns ominous and scary
what I saw, it was all so... beautiful, imaginative, nostalgic, I didn't believe even in my craziest thoughts that one could enjoy seeing the power of mathematics at that level
I have know Idea what I watched It hurt my brain
My brain
So how does TSC explain this to Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue?
Orange goin wild on this video bruh💀💀💀💀
1+1=2
the animation is already cool but its way cooler when you understand the math of that scene
orange and your lead animator is smart
Bro just explained what we learn in school in a video
I knew up untill the wave part
How did he make a perfect circle
すごい。汗かいた。感動した。
That absolutely amazing
this needs to be a game
Beauty of math
Love how Euler's Number is a successor to Clipper from classic AvA, with it's swordfighting
Bro is just doing what we do on a calculator when we are bored.
2
He even made math fun, Alan Becker to me is a god
I'm only a highschooler, so at some point, I couldn't understand anymore, but for some reason I feel like I learned a lot. Maybe 5years from now I'll watch this again and see how much I learned.
When math is not boring anymore
Somehow I feel my math has improved a lot after watching this video lol
ЦИФРЫ УДАРИЛИ В ГОЛОВУ
The + end
TSC>Math 💀
What a brain
entendi las referencias Xd
math final boss
BRO locura total
why does this looks like the one scene in the incredibles movie
AMZING
2+2=fisz
I will show this to my children in future (25/6/2023)
I now have seen power of god
︎
When teachers say your gonna use this math someday, you better listen!
Ever thought about collaborating with 3Brown1Blue and making a legendary Stickman&Math anime?
oh no. He's gonna find out about geometry pretty soon.
Brain. Hurts. to the 10x² = x if x = 8.
If math can be this fun then I will love math
Don't you dare showing him what integrals are
Short Please😅😅
The sound design is super satisfying!!!
Yo después de ver el vídeo: AAAAAAH MI CEREBRO
Is was super cool but i'd like to mention that the two out of 4 equations in 8:26 were actually wrong it should of had -isin(π) instead of a +isin(π)
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
These equations I think could break reality and have already obliterated my 🧠
cool
Learn math from school ❌ Learn math from alan becker✅
Not gonna lie, but this be like when you're playing Little Alchemy bro.
if math was like this i would be able to show my teacher that she does in fact play games
1+1 =2
To much maths for my brain to handle 😂😂😂
2+2=4
Bro is making math look easy
Wow stickmans is smart
10+10=20
1+1=10🙄
僕の苦手分野きたこれ
Hello there, This is the only video in the internet world that has ever shocked me!  I would like to use your work for educational purposes if you don't mind ☺
i feel sad 😭
This is the same math that I need.
I love how everything is easily switching, turning and merging :D
My brain……
Я знаю, что корень из 9 - это 8. Потому что 8 стоит перед 9.
Math teacher love this
bro made math useful
"Dad I don't know math, can you teach me?"   "Watch this video son"
,,
Now parents will show this to their kids for school
''Life is short'' ''Girlfriend is nothing'' ''Mother father god bless you'' ''Support is everything''❤❤
What do I praise first? The animation quality ir the amount of research done in finding the formulas to incorporate into the video?
5:34 my god, he truly is the second coming. He just drew a perfect circle.
me not understaning most o this but still enjoying it
As a student i can confirm that i learned more in this 14 minute video than 2 years of lessons in school
When you're an animator and you're too good at math, and you get bored in your math class:
If only they showed this when I was in math class. XD
This is unnecessarily epic
Too easy 1 + 1 =🐟
I just hope orange keeps his math power like green and music sounding. Imagine the fighting ring they have.
This stickman smart than Albert Einstein 💀
Orange bro learned math in 14 minutes better than me in 9 years of education in school💀
As a math nerd myself, this makes me happy :)
I wish school was like this
I've learned and understood more math in this video than in any year of school
why always there's a fight
New most powerful character unlocked : "nerd tsc
I'm pretty much become interested in math because of this
All about math
teachers should show this in school
This is geneus
This stickman is better at math than 90% of the people
Bro make the gun with math💀💀
He's cooking up something incredible
I just realize at 12:27, Orange made a spelling of EXIT, so the e understood what he's trying to convey.
That Was really awesome
I want to praise this video, but I'm not good at English 😢
if you understood this entire video then congrats
Simplemente bello
How to fly : make a math equation 😊
Conclusion - Orange is a genius
Can't believe how it escalated quickly and orange mastering almost everything
The world of math, huh? At first glance, it is empty, but if you delve into the details, you can understand that it is devilishly complex and huge, and at the same time very simple and logical.
I don't even understand half of this! it's so good I can't tell if any of this is really math or not
Wow❤❤❤
omg
how is this 14 minutes long i felt like it was 5
Atleast the math got friends to hang out with at the end
Por un momento pensé que Alan despertaría de un sueño sobre un libro de cálculo mientras estudiaba para un examen 😂
1+1=2😊
Wow
1+1=2
Back when i was in a math learning center, the first quarter of the video with TSC experimenting with equations is literally what i imagine when I do my homework
Can't believe i'm willingly watching math
Wow
12:36 For anyone wondering what happened here, i is the square root of -1(As shown in this animation earlier) The i is for "imaginary," A mockery that stuck for some reason.  The rest gets logical after that, I is square root of one, i times i, Or i squared is then -1. So i x i x i is then -i Finally, i⁴ is one because i³ x i is the same as i²xi², i² is -1, And -1 x -1 is, As you may know, just 1, Back where you started,  e was trying to show that i is "rotational," You will always return to your current position if you keep multiplying by just i.   I know I could have explained better, But please forgive me, I'm not that smart.😅
Im so bath at math its not even funny. Still got goosebumps watching this!
Wow its amazing!!
this is the best video that includes math
5:35 man did a perfect circle
Im just in first year high school and I didn't even understand even one bit💀
Star Wars be like:
You+Tube=you tube i am right😅
bro this is creativeness OUT OF THIS WORLD, 69/10 did u go to collage btw?
1+1 55
Better than the entire Avengers franchise
Math the movie
My head hurts
Oye esta genial
This episode is not meant for my brain.
im so happy this exists
everyone knows 1+1 is 21
👏👏👏
wow, just wow
this are just insane!
bro my brain melted
1+1=2
The coolest animation i've ever seen, because he learned me about math a lil' bit, cuz i was studying in 5 class!    And also, animations are still 🔥🔥🔥
The new math lore looks insane Definitely best update since they added circles I thought this game was dead after the devs added calculus but I think the devs still care about this game and it’s fan base
Nothing here just Alan Becker became Albert Einstein
mmm im learning from a video
everyone knows 1+1 is 3
This Should Be In YouTube Premium
Bro literally had a 9 in his pocket
Explaining the last part of the video (since I saw no one seems to do it in the comments): I believe stickman wanted to go back to his world so he suggested to the exponential that if multiplying by sqrt(-1) made them go to an imaginary world then maybe if we multiply so many of them we can go into another dimension (his dimension). but the exponential proceeded to explain that multiplying imaginary units is actually periodic and gave the example that i^4 = 1 so all you get is 1,i,-1,-i. which is basically two dimensions; the real one and the imaginary one, so multiplying finitely many of them wouldn't work. The exponential then got an idea. he went up and got the circle. then expanded himself in a taylor series. He then re-expressed the series as a sum over the n-volumes of unit n-hyperspheres. the exponential then proceeded to cover the stickman with an infinitely dimensional hypersphere through a limiting process where he started from zero (which was the dot) and ended up at infinity. after that, they said goodbyes then the exponential altered the pi to i*pi to multiply i^infinity by the hypersphere volume. thus applying stickman's original idea and sending him into another dimension of order infinity (sorta through a wormhole) to get back to his own world.  The End Amazing video by the way. Props to your animator, I really loved every single bit of this video!
This want me to learn math even more 😆
1+1=0 come on guys it's basic math
It's hard, I'm stupid, I don't know that
1 +1 = 11
10:02 Memeable.    Tuvo que tener ayuda de JulioProfe para hacer esto XD
1+1=2
How to learn math in 14 mins
i need a math tutorial from alan😁😁
why is this so cool? how are the sound effects so good?
I mean... Isn't Alan asian ?
No… the answer is 1
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😵
it’s funny cuz I don’t even understand most of this vid 💀😭
Am I the only one that’s confused?
1000+1000000=1001000
Cant wait for animation versus alphabet😎😎👍
If -1 goes into the complex world, JUST ADD YOURSELF WITH I
Plz do part 2 Here’s an idea for the beginning of part 2.           It starts of with a recap of part 1 but… at the end of the recap it shows a little dot falling then going through the portal and tsc is able to use it to communicate with Euler’s number and tsc can also use it to create Shields, swords exc exc. to escape prison.    Edit1:also I imagine the mathverse to be it’s own dimension     Edit2:I imagine tsc exited in the same that he entered so he’s still in prison
Went through this whole video without using the quadratic formula. Can’t believe the lies my math teacher told me smh
Insane
teacher: math is easy  smart student:"speed running math"
I love how this summed up 14 years of math in 14 minutes.
"ℵ" exists as the best friend of e
this must be crazy for people who know calculus

Math gameplay: Math lore:
My brain hurts while watching this.😵‍💫
bro went on the calculator app for too long
Best video ❤❤
my brain after this:
what's 9+10?
The animation is AWESOME and all the math stuff is incredible. The only thing is, i did not understood anything that happend😂 although it was amazing! Nice work.
Learning in class with words? No thanks…  Learning in YouTube with animations? *Hell ye*
Dude why did this make me interested in math all of a sudden
So this is why my calculator is screwed up
This should be in cool math games
8:16 Terraria reference
as a not math nerd, I can confirm I understood nothing but it looked correct to me 👍
😅
guys i got a 2 on the math test i think this didn't help 😔
Wait. How did The Second Coming even GET inside the calculator app?
This is the most fun mathematics visualization period
Alan becker dus no idea how long it takes to be a MATH!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool animations be like
10+10=29
Only Alan Becker could make math and letters look cool, interesting, and badass
now that is art
I didn't understood anything, but great animation ^^
You bot you don't know math 1+1 is 2
1+1 hmmmmmmmmm 8 im a genius
No 1+1 = 111
Bro like a best caculator
This taught me more about math than school ever has
13:26 infinity dimensions space machine
Make orange solve actual problems shorts by level of math
Huh, never knew math was a game.
That’s super cool. Wish I understood math.
this video is fear of every magician
Good
Alan you must be my emergency teacher XD
Theres music notes in math
Why did i saw 17 hour was 17 years ago
Tienes un talento increíble Alan.
Animation vs. Meth
As Paul Erdös said “Mathematics is not yet ripe for such question”
thats weird. i always saw math as a world war between positive and negative numbers but you do you, i guess.
Plz make more of this a would love to see really cool math battles
This is one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen, hands down. The fact that you could so clearly and visually explain some of the hardest concepts in math, from multiplication all the way to trigonometry. The animation is stellar, with every math concept perfected to beauty. As someone who loves math, animation, and Alan Becker, this is a work of art. Keep being awesome!
Orange is gonna turn yellow
I didn't know r was a real command btw it's also in minecraft so I think they are gonna combine math and minecraft
If math was achally  like this it would be so much fun
aleph hits hard 💀
TSC finna be smarter than yellow
no way is it 1am  and im watching a stick figure fight math................ thats a like
All fun and game until X and Y doing some stuff
bro orange did not just draw a perfect circle
wtf no entendi nada pero fue epico XD
the legend is back
Who hates math click the like button, you like math comment.
This is too high I Q for mere mortals
New video siuuuu
9:59 , calculus, master of math
imagine if Alan's team joins sony in making the new spiderman movie
e so cute
He really turned math into a Bossfight right now I am at 4:50
This Animation Just Teached Me Math Better Than My Own Math Teacher💀
ALSO TRY TERRARIA
alan you killed me in math it's a lot and I'm only in 5th grade of primary school
that so COOL 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
WHY AM I ALWAYS LATE…
I always knew math was evil😱
This was so so cool to see and I love this video😮😄😁
This all makes sense if you think about it
BATTLE OF WITS
Math Wars: The Attack of Euler's
What’s 9+10? 21;-;
Eu sabia essa com maçãs
Best vid ever I love math
you deserve perfect followers and like granules of your videos, congratulations😁👌
🤯🤯🤯
i feel like i just had an entire dissertation on the theory of math force fed to me in the span of 14 minutes and understood none of it...

7:40 sigma math
Animation vs science
Who knew that Euler's identity would be such a formidable foe
omg
Even if I never understood math, this is clearly one of my favorite episodes
Every one knows 2+2=22
i LOVED this!!!!! idk why but i love math a lot, so this jus made my night🤭❤️❤️ also, dont know what math teacher said Alan wouldnt make it, but he clearly wanted to prove them wrong👀 my guy taught me more in 14 mins than my entire 4 yrs at high school…
What's with the hebrew?
Being a math student I enjoyed it a lot
It's great, it's great! How glad I am for the appearance of imaginary numbers, constants, series! And the appearance at the end of the transfinite ordinal א surprised me very pleasantly! (Yes, I'm translating through Google again and I hope that the meaning is at least a little conveyed).
Never in my life gaining so much motivation for learning more math in a single video
10:03 Now ‘e is mad😂
Bro really made do math during summer
Cool Vedic, also, the stick is right, 1 plus 1 equals 2
respect to alan for studing high level maths for this vdo💀💀
This video will make one of the reasons why the number of students love the subject math increase drastically
This has to be one of the best animation ever created by Alan
I don't know how alan made math fun.
ppl who came from tiktok 🫤👇
Ive learn more fr9m this vedeos than school itself
Alan Beker teaches more than college
Ối dồi ôi, nào là số nguyên, số phức, tỉ số lượng giác, đồ thị, bán kính đường tròn r và π, nguyên hàm, tiệm cận... Đầu tôi nổ tung mất
Math Lore
If alan becker made a math course like this for all ages, I would happily take this course
Alan becker where's the episode 2 in wanted
e
my teacher could NEVER
the two brain cells at the math lesson
Alan Becker Theory 💀
Gracias muchas gracias ahora cosa de un edificio que más puedo decir algo
What?
Cheese Balls.
I think this is what's going on in Albert Einstein's mind
Bro lt is 2
math lore:
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😀❤️💚
naahh i'm doing my homework
dude really did the impossible and made math look cool. very impressive
Now I can make a death weapon in math
How to make math as a movie, sad, cool:
i just barely understood all of this, and it made me giggle with joy.  great animation!
got me learning math with a stickman
Bro just teach me the real math
Can we just appreciate how TSC went from basic addition to the far end of Calculus in under twenty minutes. That is a hell of a learning curve.
Wait a minute, wtf  That was sus
That was actually so friggin cool
I have never seen someone make math interesting
Nobody: A random math nerd: *Tries to find a mistake to get mad at alen becker*
Alan, may I show this to my math teacher plsplsplsplspls xD
wow 😮
Next vid:Animation vs cience *Blue breaking a atom*
that feeling when a stickman understands math better than me
1+1=2
@nihongomantappu
Love you are animation❤
1+1=2
Next we need Animation vs science.
Maths can be coll 😎 well he is getting better day by day
we now see rare symbols at the end  ζ φ δ א
Now i love maths
ok so e i pi means 0, right?
This really melted my brain
ok 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤪🤪🤪
Hi
THIS WAS SO COOL!
such godlike creativity
my brain🤯💥💥💥💥
This is dope
Aaaaa my eyes hurt
the fact that i understand mor than half of this makes studying for my engi degre feel worth it
But yes it3?
If you look closely to the background while e ζ δ Φ are there you can see aleph
How the heck do you make math fun?
1+1 very ex =3 I so smart
Animation... VS... Roblox?
Woah. Now I want Euler’s Identity and Orange Mathematical Stickguy in Super Smash Bros. :O
Cool animation 😁
Alan becker stickman is boyndless cause he can destroy the conceot if mathematics
i thought in the end , the number going into the 3d space and define the 4D equation
Damn TSC really just committed war crimes with that infinite function. Math pls nerf.
what did bro just do...
Bro i learned maths more sincerely than my maths teacher
Math made INTERESTING
😅
Does anyone notice that oranges head has like a slight curve?
NO 1+1=2
А все начиналось с 1+1..
Men me watching this is like spoiled me the new math lesson
This is probably the greatest stickman animation I've ever seen so far
only the great minds behind the alan becker team can make a math film
We not gonna talk about how he broke the fabric of space
why did theme song gave me chills
2+2= it's a fish
1 + 1 = ♾️
wow
Tsc is smart af   Edit: the asian parent are proud of him and he become doctor
The new math 2 trailer is fire, yo🔥🔥
me exploto la cabeza, matematicas en su estado mas puro y fascinante
Cool, keep spirit, Alan, I hope you are always healthy, bro Cool, keep spirit,
bro became Albert Einstein in 3sec🗿
What if =f(♾) + cos and isin
I swear if my teacher made animations like this I wouldn’t stay in the bathroom to skip half of class
e is so cute
my brain í broken😨
damn my brain got hurt
wii
I love this dude as I am a massive nerd.
cocks arithmetic gun with mathematical intent
its amazing that he created an tractor beam from portal 2
so i dont need school i can just go off of this
Wow
never would I have imagined a literal reenactment of numbers fighting to their deaths, or Euler's constant hijacking the battlefield. yet Alan takes all of this and turns it into a masterpiece that gives us a glimpse into the mathematical mind of a genius. a truly cinematic experience, to put it into perspective.
It not it 2
Someone out there, show this to your math teacher and see if they can turn this into a class. Tell me how it goes, i wanna see if some teacher out there would actually like the idea
nightmare:
oh...alef zero?         (alef zero=inf)
PART+2
next..  "physics"
Where is the Video with the pure music?
I've never been this captivated by basic math... Amazing work.
This could be a good possible reason for me to learn math🤓
el mejor video no esixt...
Next animation vs science
I learned math in 14 minutes
Call Of Duty like sound effects, lol
At the end the big number is aleph null or the smallest infinity
I dont think we need that much math to survive
ＭＯＭ, i saw the GOD
the only bad thing about this video is that it ended...
This is probably the coolest video ive ever seen ngl
It always happen to me when I am solving maths problem
Just Imagine A Video Game Just Like This One Where Players Fight Euler's Number and Other Functions By Using Thier Mathematical Knowledge for Creating Weapons.Not only It Would Be Fun It would Increase Mathematical Intelligence Too.  That would Be Soooo Awesome!!
If Math was this entertaining to learn, i would've payed more attention in class lmao.
Did you know that (e^pi)-pi is stupidly close to 20, but not quite 20?
Это видео объясняет математику за все класс лучше чем книги, хоть я в 5 классе.
I like this video Alan beker.
Who knew math could be so interesting and it can help u solve fights bro i need to learn more
if math was a game this would be the tutorial
Wow this guy is so smart that he fucking said 11!!
The most normal dream of the mat techer:
The Alan Becker channel is like Marvel but for YouTube
4:56 π (3.14)/4?
1+1=2
my brain in math class
"a escola te prepara pra vida" eu na aula de matematica:
Orange be speed running through math man
I thought I'd meet Baldi, but he wasn't there..
12+13?
1:08 bruh
I wish there was a program where you can replicate this.
Yo no entendi nada de las ecuasiones
1 + 1 is 73
This video literally taught me more math than all my teachers did in my 30 years of learning
Wow orenge is smart i think?!
Oh my god that’s amazing 1:15
What a Hell
Bro learned Math faster than I did.
That escalated quickly
This was surprisingly awesome even thou im not friends with math
Learning math in school:🥱🙄 Learning math in alan becker video: 👌🧐🤓🤑☺️
Im a mathematician and im confused on how you managed to animate this
This has to be Alan’s calculator on his phone (bc the background is dark
This is literally the best animation that Alan ever made. Like look at Orange stickfigure (I forgot the name) Makes some sort of a gun!
1+1=2
10đ Very Good
As a very curious programming nerd who's always loved math, science, history, etc.... I LOVE THIS and it put such a huge smile on my face!  It made me so happy I literally cried because it shows just how AMAZING AND COOL math can be!!!!
“1+1 is 2, 2+2 is 4 quick maths”
Good
Amazing alan blacker🎉🎉🎉
for the ones wondering whats up with that transformation of moivre to a infinite series, using the taylor polynomial of e to the power of x, centered in 0 (a=0),  and replalce x with iPI, u get the sum that shows in the video c:
MATH The Movie
“when i was a kid, i thought this was real, so i started drawing all the math symbols and a stick character and waited for them to fight” -the comments section in 10 years

Animation vs History
ay mi niño, y por que te van a dar miedo las matematicas?? Los sueños del niño:
This animation is sick!
I never knew a math lesson could be this fun
Animation vs History
they should try meth instead!
10:02 BRO SAID "WAÅAÀAÆ" TO HEAVEN
I finally learned how to spell matth.
I love the giant Aleph looming at the end!
This video is so confusingly cool
Vietnam be like:1+1=3😂😂😂
why so true :o
The new power of TSC.
I think I now understand a little better what my math teacher meant when he said "math is fun"!
after this video my brain will become dead💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Splitting the pi sign to be cos and tan was brilliant.  As someone who’s taken calculus 1 and 2 in college, this video is both frustrating and interesting.  Honestly wish I saw this while I was still studying because this would’ve helped a bit, or at least kept me still interested in calculus
The fact that TSC learned the whole math lore in just like, 5 minutes-
This + is - an + amazing + video ❤❤❤
Oh my god
All those complicated math and equation, just to find a friend and a way back home.  also, never in my wildest college days i imagine, that a circle can be a fu*king orbital cannon
Math is Literally The Symbol of Existance. But We Don’t Know How to Learn Math Though
Math nerds : "Interesting calculation of limit as x goes to infinity" (got it from whittyboy1009 comment :x) Me : Lol orang' figtin' letter e
i suppose that orange is the smartest stickman alive
I would be lying if I said I understood more than like a quarter of the math here but this is still awesome
The only time ive been intrested in math💀
Can't believe it this is such as a perfect animation, this video motivate me to learn maths
Second became to smart and accidentally made a math monster made of math
I think so you can make video animation vs geometry dash,I love this channel❤❤😊
Ah yes, 16 hours ago and 1d ago comments 🙂
This will happen again and i don’t want to know hoy it ends…
Now i learn Math
that tickles my brain
That was just sooo beutiful
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
10:01 UWWWEEEEEEE >:(
I think i’ve learned alot from this video Thank u Alan
Who knew math of all things could be so awesome and entertaining... Though I'd say it's majorly thanks to those incredible sound effects!
🔘🔘🔘what happned at 13:00 to the 13:40
Very nice
1+1= baby 1, 1, window, 11, I I, X I, one and one, 1️⃣1️⃣, 1️⃣,🪟  So there is many answers.
1+1 is 2
I wish I had the worthy IQ to enjoy this video to the fullest
I have no idea what I just watched but I enjoyed it
This has some Mr Incredible hacking Syndrome's computer vibes to it.
Isn’t it obvious that 1 + 1 is 36?
My brain is now not braining anymore
Animathion
My mind and brain when i tried to do solution on math quiz be like:
if i saw math like this i would actually pass my classes
Let’s be real, 1+1 is 2
Bro went from first grade to college in 14 minutes
Okay, but how did he get there??  Amazing, honestly. Though that very empty space and the music was giving me something of a borderline existential crisis, for a few seconds.
What we wished what math class was:
Bro's a genius
Bro this animation is to good to be real :0 I love it ^^
A journey Grade 1 to Graduation 🎓
Some math nerd had way to much fun making this
Bro went from first grade to college
Bro used =f (8) as a machine gun
No 1+1= 21
I never though that math could be satisfying
that portal looks a lot like the black stick man XD
Nice! Now we just have to see the - end.

This is how my calculator works.
2 + 2 is equal to 🐟 who doesn't know that?
Ooh this is need math 😂😂
Raise your hand if you didn’t watch the full vid.
When bro the chosen one episodes will come
e with a W
I love this math
nice video
4:40 Discount clippy Versus TSC (Colorize) (2023)
Math is now cool.
wow this is amazing animation video about math  i love it
Alan Becker please make a game you're so good I'll play your game morning and night😊
math pvp
iπ e
This.. is.. GODLIKE
Bro i don't think this video is so great🎉
if this was how you learned math i would be able to do anything
Next is Animation Vs English
Is there a possibility that you might wanna make something about stickman vs tetris'd? As a child those 2 were my favorite 😭
Next video - Animations vs. Real life
Perfection
bruh... as a math lover this was one of the most enjoyable videos I've watched. I can recognize math patterns but also soak in the creativity and entertainment of this video. Alan Becker, big respects to you for making this masterpiece, I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it! keep it up, I would love to see a part 2
And that's literally how the math works! By the way, was it inspired by xkcd 2343 or something? =)
you ar the best
.-.-
Doing math has always been a battle
10000 + 10000 = 20000
Why is everything so...edgy?  Where are his friends?  How did he get there?
Orange + (1+1)=  ai
This guy is absolutely insane he made a story about math, who would think of such a thing only Alan Becker
The level of imagination and animation is seriously top notch!🤌🏼
THIS SHOULD BE HOW WE TEACH MATH THIS IS SOO AMAZING!!!
10:56 infinity power            ⚪  /|\  | | |  | | |   /\   |  |   |  | Bro i just make a stick man
If school teached Kids Like this I swear Things would be so much better
What if... Animation vs Programming
This guy just made math 1000000 times cooler
Dammm My heart it Shut Down😂
This was such a nerdy joy to watch well done
How I wish I could do this in algebra.
א?
You should do animation vs roblox
calculator is gonna be the best game ever since this dropped
not only did alan somehow make Euler's identity badass, he also made all of its alternate forms even more badass
That was really good
Every second of watching this, I got math confusion
Bro the comments here are like: ☝️🤓 in fact
Wait hold on TERKOIZ?!!  FROM SHOCK?!
I hate how a literal stickman is better at math than me
Not gonna lie this is very and sort of educational
Ahora ya se para que te enseñan matematicas en la escuela, simplemente para entender este video, porque para otra cosa en mi vida nunca eh utilizado lo que sale a partir de 1+1
I did know that knowledge is power.                  I didn't know that math would become god!
La belleza de la matemática!~
I wish math was like this
Is this what happens inside a calculator?
Math grades 1 to 11 in 13 minutes.
Damn so many insane numbers damn I learnt more about math from this movie than from uni
Orange went Albert instein
I wonder how much math Alan learned while making this
Bro I don't understand math 🗿but this is just incredible ✨✨✨✨
(Cos) + (sin) = skip😂
Probably one of my favourite of the Animation vs. something series out there, the music and theme reminded me of interstellar with it's mathematical and philosophical moments. A continuation of this would be so cool, with the return of Euler's identity to help The Second Coming fight off against Agent Smith and his group.
I dont understand anyone
Missed opportunity to put 9 + 10
orange IQ: ∞
Simply Amazing your a Genius
Вот такую математику яб изучал
i think those funny big looking letters are supposed to be stronger then e
when the math teacher goes on a rampage:
Who knew that math could start ww3? But it leads into no more war
Узнал больше чем за 5 лет школы😂
this is very interesting, entertaining and kinda educational
math teacher tournaments be like:
what math teachers mean by real world:  didn't know they mean it would be life, death, and friendship.
An animator has just reviewed all the math that you learn for roughly more than 20 years in 14 mins of Youtube video, presented how beautiful math is. Alan just created a new education system combine both mathmetics and animtaion :)
I have no idea what e^iπ is.
e
thanks for the refresher for the test tomorrow
10:01 Řøbœţ
Yo orange got an assault rifle
5:36 Perfect ​circle??!?!​
11:19 M163?
then math learn be easy 😎😎
very god o FELICITACIONES MAN, alto video ando re flasheando
1x1=1 Good
if you understand, you've skipping elementary to high school.
This is a masterpeice
I love the soundtrack in this video so much
Only Alan could make math interesting
I’m stupid and bad at math so can someone please explain why there is a א at the end?
1+1 is= £
WOOOOOOOOOOOOW
so cool!! I like it!
Bro who has the free time to make this thing to make me go crazy
Math class day dreaming
I waited a year for math💀
Animator vs stickman =shorts flim then action
What…..
1+1=2
woah
Anybody waiting for animation vs browsers
Do you have season 2?
The most boring thing in school becoming an epic animation is crazy
When you break the sound barrier be like 11:19
i did not understand the math on the video but it looks cool
as a physics student, and im waitting animation vs physics, I will ready give my imagination
😂😂😂😂jajajaajajjajajaja1+1=2
yoooooo the alpha(0)!!!!!!!! bigger than the infinity!!!!!!
1+1= 2
my brain hurts.
I have complete my maths homework now😅
ХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХАХ ГЕНИИ 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This is what you feel when your in a wheel 11:16
これ、数学コンプリートできる....?
God sound car
Math
It's just tooo cool...i am myself a mathematics lover and I just love the way you portrayed this as an animation
I didn't understand anything but I liked it
You just turn anything into a fight, don't ya, it's funny though
Animation vs Infinity Blade
Bro i need more
Yeah everybody know 40-0=4
Wow. That's so dramatic against maths
Bro teaches better than my math teacher
That’s what makes math so interesting their is always an unknown equation and just a new one to be discovered and infinite possibilities
Estuvo muy buena la animación
Good thing I am a math nerd
Math transformer be like: 9:47
The first time i felt math is funni
This sounds like new Minecraft music
Que vídeo gostoso de ver
This is da best. I love Math but I watch this  I love it even more . BTW THE COOLEST VIDEO
1:49 bro wanted to became internet explorer
How tf did he even imagine that?!?!?!
Zombie war zone be like 8:30
THAT WAS SO FREAKING COOL!!!!!!
Can anyone tell me how he became smarter than me
Itz back
1+1=2
See Guys? Math Is Easy!!
استاذ الرياضيات اذا سوى انميشن😂:  Mathematics professor, if only an animation😂:
Math but I fight with it=))))))))))
Man, I can’t wait to learn how to summon interdimentional vortexes using right angles.
When a 14 min video felt like an hour movie:
Wow ! Who are you bro ?
can't even do math in ogio☠️
i never thought an animation of someone fighting with math would be so cool
Base ball bat be like 8:17
Great just great you broke math
amazing
🎉
My head hurts 😂 I hate math, but that was awesome
i say 7
I learned more from this then any teacher could have hoped for
Wow the video got so much better the more you go on😮
MY MAN IS LEARNING MATH
WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW
if math class was this interesting i woulda paid wayyyy more attention in class-
Alan always make a short video feel like a movie. It isn't just clicking, it's a whole war with a letter E, this is all accurate.
Pt2?
Awesome
Oh no! My brain😵
And 2+2=5
Math war be like: 7:18
The e's name is Euler /oi' ler/
문과가 봐도 재밌는 영상😂
Why isn’t there 69
only thing i saw in this video was the nerd emoji.
I understood nothing of what was happening but it was epic.
Everyone knows 1 + 1 equals 2
Not only you have made the entertaining animation involving maths in it, but it also shows the hard work you have done to study complicated maths. I have learned a thing or two from this
Un matematico estaria orgulloso
マジですごい。文系だから途中からすごいことしか分からなかったけど本当にすごい。アニメーションとしても満足度が高いのに、他のコメントを見る限り数学に関する表現も素晴らしい。アランさんは本当にすごい。
Bro took “only asian can understand this to another level”💀
1+1=3
This was more captivating then a movie in a theater for me and im not in any way shape or form a math wizard , An amazing  visual on this one
Bro is better than my school😭
i love orange
Next matrixes
animate this It's one thing but knowing what you're cheering for:☠️☠️☠️
This guy is making fun of Math while we trying to understand the Math..
This makes me think super paper Mario
This is true I check from the calculator and it all true the numbers digits fraction and everything!!!
The adventures are always crazy! First it's minecraft and now it's math! I can't wait to see what's next!
how understand math easly
This is very inspirational for mathematicians to keep their momentum going man great video it values us
Even me is even confused
I imagine this to take place inside of Alan's calculator
My friend: "Why do you hate math?" Me: shows this video My friend: "I don't get it" Me: " *EXACTLY* "
Tf is this
Math is pretty interesting
The background music was epic
This is an award-worthy piece of art. It's so beautiful.
"Math class"
See I don't  what's going on whatsoever but I like how all of the math is depicted as alien almost it's strange or... Well alien to the stick figures at least
The fact that math mech can actually be created in math makes my mind blow up
All I know is:1+1=2
math teacher👁️👄👁️
If only schools would teach meath this way.
woow that was amazing it look like a movie!
my bro made mathematics sentient
1 1111111
After finishing this video, I now have a doctorates in mathematics
what if 1+1=?
My brain with 200iq and 28000braincell said "wtf?!"😂
I have officially learned one thing, math includes fighting - I conclude
12:24 do you know that mean? Is actully exit
Guy can make a interesting animation from math
I want "Wanted" Ep 2
i LOVED this even though i dont know what the HELL happened. i hope one day i can look back at this when im 30 with full knowledge of how it works.
おもしろい
me dont understand after 1:40
1+1=11 XD
This is the only time I have fun with math
Aleph at the end got me like
Epic❤
e was always my favorite number. You can do so much with it.
H❤.                                   ☺️
that is a story, 10 × 12 = 120
So many teachers are going to use this video to help explain math in a fun way and im so excited for that fact
how he even get in there?
❤❤❤❤
Now i wanna be mathematician so i can understand this
awesome ❤
Wow is look matchrix (Match with Matrix) for me 😍😍😍😍
Is this what it's like to enjoy math?
dude this is a movie
1+1=2
Я тут не одна русская?
Alan dando un increíble resumen de la matemática. Empieza con 1+1=2 y termina en una batalla epica de numeros ecuaciones y letras q sepa de donde salieron
yoooooooooo
This is so complicated I have no idea what is going on
do science now
PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE MAKE EULER VS KING ORANGE, I BEG OF YOU.
Bro just studying for an exam
最後に-1の伏線回収するの鳥肌立った。ストーリーの構成がうますぎる、、
como pueden aser las matematicas tan divertidas
Amazing animation
Esta animaciones es una obra de arte
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD..
New skill unlocked : Absolute Calculations
This is so cool and creative! Definitely my second or third favourite AVA animation
Theory; Orange:escapes the void Also orange:shows it to his friends Also also orange:gives them the math One of the dudes:becomes evil with math Everyone:goes to stop him *End*
So that's how the calculator works
Is Inf
Super smart battle
Math
Whoa this so amazing 🤩👏 part2??🔥
Only alan and his team can make a math fight
legit i love this bro and i kinda learned from it. please keep creating content like this, its really amazing!
1+1=3👍
[cute]
And they say I can't learn anything from stickman
i wish it was that easy to learn math
Bro I think I learned something from watching this 💀
1+1=2🎉m i
Umm wtf ?
Props to that one kid who doesn’t understand this
Asi me siento en la carrera
how the hell did you make math so adorable omfg
this is how i want to learn about math hahaha
=f(•)
I don't like Chinese math!! It's so difficult!!
Pov me in a math exam
Cool
i would really like to see a part 2 of this where the rest of the stick figures and maybe adding more math things that werent shown in this video
"#48 on Trending for gaming" Yes. Gaming.
Yes this math battle show us nerds that we can battle with math
Real-World Maths: Really Hard Math in Alan Becker's Video: The Battle is Epic and makes the Brain Hot 🗿
I want 2 part of this haha
Bro becoming Albert Einstein 💀😅
As someone studying Trig right now with the goal of complete long Calculus, this is both fascinating and entertaining
As a math nerd I want a part 2 where the equations spill into the computer via the calculator app
Mathematician: “relatable”
enemies to friends :)
This video is definitely gonna be played in math class
Bro's about to make time travel equations
this is sick and cool as hall
А ведь это все основано на законах математики, и Алан смог превратить их в анимацию
you are the best math teacher i've ever got
this man did not just make math interesting i know he didnt
Bro doesn’t know how to do math.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow, I wish I knew enough about math to understand what was going on here
Bro really animated all the school year math
I need soundtrack PLS TELL ME
I’m one minute in and I already FUCKING LOVE THIS! HOT DAMN YOU MADE MATH COOL
Sequal pls
I never would have thought math is so freaking cool. Well done guys
I didn’t know looking at someone just doing math could look so COOL
My brain is not braining
it was worth living to see functions becoming machine guns.
I'm in second grade and the only math ik how to do is addition subtraction and times   I can actully learn somthing from this😮
i feel so dumb just by watching this bruh
1 + 1 is 11 because you add a 1 in front of 1🤯🤯🤯
being a math nerd i was amazed on seeing the precision of calculations in this video...... literally this was sensational.... hats of to u and ur team alan
why is this actually interesting lol
yo
that cool
Title:stick figure makes death star with numbers while battling with e
1+1 is not 11
(•)
Please do a part 2
This was amazing ❤❤❤❤
😅
This is amazing!
How do I like twice?
I know just enough to understand what’s going on as it’s happening, and it is some of the most creative and inspired works of arts I have ever seen. Truly amazing
Now that Orange is defeating conceptual beings like math and manipulating infinitely powerful objects like 1 and pi, i'm just saying does Goku gets stomped by a stick figure?🤔
This was amazing, with our a doubt your best one, 🎉
This is... transcendental <3
:) unless i watch your vids i wont be bored
I’m learning things that I didn’t know existed
Bro just teach math fir kids
Learn from school ❌ Learn from orange ✅
bro some how made math epic
First time Im actually paying attention during a math video.
Dude this is too good
I want the soundtrack for this dang it.
Amaz+sim-m+ng
Con and sin were already cool for me but you made it more cool 🤩🤩
yo nice animetion
How to say your good at math without saying you're good at math:
is this what happens when the math teacher is not watching? lol
This is possibly the best video I"'ve ever seen, showed it to both my dad and sister who are mathematicians and they loved it, it's been an hour and they're still talking about it hahah.  My dad told me he's going to show the video to his class! "Introduction to calculus" at the university. Greetings from Chile :) Thanks for the amazing animations as always
"Mom when am I ever going to actually use all this math junk?" The use:
10/10 math lesson
Bro drew perfect circle
I cant animate or do math he dubbed me in 50 ways
5 ÷ 0 = infinity?
This is satisfiying
Why is this actually so cool
This guy made math look like a story
good animation
1+1=2+2=4+4=8+8=16
This is better then cyberchase
Alan gave a more informative math lesson in one video than most math teachers in a school year
Why this so cooooool
Math teacher Imaginary world
That's why I love maths 😊😊
This has got to be the best 'Animation vs.' video I've ever seen, amazing job
I wish I retained my Calculus knowledge a bit more to fully appreciate this masterpiece, but I enjoyed it nonetheless
Me on math grade 9
This is very underrated.
how to learn math? use formula for any combat
This feels like I'm learning math  all over again.
If a teacher can teach math like this... damm this teacher is great
Lemme guess alan becker will next animate "about the universe" btw i really like the vids his making
1+1=2
As a computer science student I require an "animation vs python" series
If you don't know some of this you can learn it if you don't focus on the action
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME I SEEN FULL VIDEO OF MATHEMATICS 😢😂😂
Imagine alien visit earth and we introduce math system by this video
The + End = TheEnd
The   =f( )   gun is now my favorite weapon ever lol
Man's never skip math class
1+1=3
yooo math
When a stick figure teaches you math faster than the teacher
Amazing. I like the math laser things
Para que examen me ayuda esto??????????????????
My brain in math class
Me when calculator
Good animation
The stick figures ARE BECOMING VERY SMART
next is science😂😂
**THE POWER OF MATHEMATICS, YOUR SON OF A B1TCH!!!!!**
nice animation keep it up
The animation is fantastic, but hats off to the sound design, it really helps sell the physicality of all this
Hapis gay
Its nice to see you make other animations!
This guy's doing Numbers!
Как понять всю математику за 14 мин😃
AHHHHH MY BRAIN !!!!          * BOOMMMMMM!!!!!!!! *
Crazy efforts and study 😮😮😮you might be a math student 🥇🥇🥇
Pro.
The moment i realize a stick figure is better than me at math...
Why is א the great almighty dominator of math?
Afgan gey
Hey look its my cossin! Sry, cousin
the sound effects are just perfect
ㅤ
my mind when I have to fight and think
Legend has it that math never mathed again
GOD I wish this was a real thing. It would be hella useful for math, and the sounds would be SO SATISFYING
as a math nerd myself, I cannot even begin to describe how happy I am to watch all of this
just wow
This is one of the most artistically brilliant projects you have ever made! Beautiful work!
Pov: -e elevado a la iπ
IT IS SOMETHINK IMPOSSIBLE!!!  🤩🤯😦
I love how this goes from "How to do math" to "SUPER LASER BATTLE THAT BREAKS REALITY". Props to whoever can understand all these formulas, cause after they got into the more theoretical stuff I was just lost.
The+End=theend
Aaaaaa! I’m 4:07
This is better than Star Wars 😅
how to understand math without understand math
Notice that orange guy just stops adding ones at 12 and adds a 2 making 14. That shows how unlucky 13 is
Me: This is one of the best graphic explanations of math I've ever seen! 5 minutes later: And... there's the fighting... XD How much research did you put into this? Seriously, I loved it! And I know an appalling amount of it (3rd year phys student)
Math classes be like: 8am: 0:18 *takes a quick nap *wake up 2 hours later 10am: 8:24
If you appreciate Alan 👇👇👇
Wth
Bro I’m finna use this video for tests 😎
I t was really nice. Thanks for the video
When the history teacher hired as history math teacher be like:    But this is cool also.
It give me big brain
sequel please
Если это поймёт не каждый. Можно ли считать, что это высоким искусство?
Wow 12 hours 2.967.756 view
bro second going big brain in this vid
why is aleph null almost invisible
satisfiying nice thanks for the help
I would genuinly watch an maths series made my alan.
This kind of reminds me of animation vs minecraft commands
1 + 1 = window because the two 1’s and the plus sign make up the side and center while the equal sign makes the top and bottom of the frame
Bro, this is what I see during my math lessons.
It is a movie that increases knowledge in a leap forward.
OH MY FUCKING GOD! IT'S SUCH A COMPLICATED MATH
Easy
Me gustan tus videos soy argentino
Does anyone remember the battle in Kim Possible between Ron's dad and the Mathter?  Similar vibes, but I subjectively think this is a 1-up on that fight.
I learned more from this video then I ever did at school
1+1 it's floor
Alternate title: Alan Teaches Math
The perfect example of chasing your nightmares 4:30
MAN... FUKKK
Why is there a Hebrew Alef at the end?
I LOVED THE VIDEO IT'S SUPER YOU WRITE ME I'M BOLIVIAN BUT I KNOW ENGLISH
Pov:you're in an math exam but don't know the answer
uuhhh bro alan ur the best animater and the best yotuber ever🤯💯🥇
I love this guy so so sooo much like its not even funny❤
it's 2
alan para cuando la continuacion de  chosen one?
Please make a video about 🙏 Animation vs Alphabets (lore)🙏
Porfavor q sea parte del lore
Bro teaching math in 2750
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD nunca vi todos mis conocimientos matemáticos en un solo video ademas hay muchas cosas que aun no entiendo
Now I know why maths teacher says maths is very powerful
Every day you get over it keep it up
Another Matherpiece has Born!!! Now we have math universe in addition of MC universe. Cant wait what will they do next time. . . Great work my man.
This why everyone hate math
After watching this i feel dumb 😂
What If this whole thing is because the government found out about alan and the stick men and this is the government testing they’re intelligence😨
The only time I’ve ever been excited to watch math
3.14159 the five digits of pi 😊😅😮😢🎉😂❤😊😅😢😮🎉❤😊😂😅😮
It is enjoyable enough just to look at it in a normal way, but for those who know some mathematics, it is really detailed and very interesting. I'm using a website to translate it, so sorry if some parts are hard to read.
I have no idea what any of this means but it’s really cool so I guess I’ll roll with it
If only they used 0÷0 and caused a black hole and destroyed everything..
POV 2030 world in math
As always, I am confounded and amazed by the sheer imagination that goes into these. It's fantastic, fun, and just masterful. Everyone should be proud in the work they do from music to art to storyboard. Everything is so much fun and I love these every time I see them pop up on my dash.
im i the only one whos brain broke ater 5 minutes
This is soo cooooool
Is it to much to ask for a calculus or atleast a derivatives version of this would be helpful for calculus in collage
GAME VIRUS WINDOWS 12
Until now I still don't understand why orange didn't duplicate itself
mt maconha
Wait, it's illegal to be smart on math and animating
POV:you're bored at math class
TSC entered the basic world.
Me in exams be like:
1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1
i stopped understanding anything after the 5 minute mark
That was so amazing
So with mathematics you will defeat the mercenaries?
the second coming knows the math, how awsome is she😮
My brain hurts…
man, TSC just created his own death star
so goodddddddddddd
look confused
7:20
Why am i feeling stupid when i watching this🤤
this is best
Ya know, I did not expect math to be this far fetched. Nice job on the video tho
Oh my head🫨😵‍💫
Aww I miss decimals
Lol
Why dose this hit so hard?
TSC solos in math adaptability  But what if yellow is in there instead of orange 💀 (since he's considered to be the smartest and will probably start the video with complex formulas than addition and has the probability to meet those other formulas at the end of the video💀)
the beginning retaught me all of elementary😂
This was an awesome story. Really reminds me of the beginning days of Ani vs animator. This is the best kind of edutainment.
This is more educational than 10th grade Math was for me.
Very cool
Question: 1 + 1 = ?                  [❌] 2  [🔺] 11 [⚪️] 21 [◻️] ?
If they made this as a visual learning material, i mightve actually done well in my math
My brain: 💥
2 + 2 = 🐟
Bro learn math to animate
2 + 2 = 🐟
my brain doesn't braining
Alan had to go back to school to make this one
Math just got interesting
what animation engine so you use?
I swear anything this man makes is fire
gosh all the  math knowledge that i have since high school are comming back :-;
Well, that’s one way to take a math test.
What's next animation vs Conways game of life
💖
I want like this more!!❤
ah yes
0-0=
4:53 Aim "Two" the E
Imagine if this is the rocket people testing to see SC’s iq in math. He is in a simulation.
woww i want a physics version
me trying to escape school:
4x4 = 12
Masterpiece
pov: the only time math can be cool
This made me wish I was a math teacher just to show this in my class to be the coolest math teacher ever
Man cool animation.
Bro took math to another universe
Math teachers better show students this because it makes me want to learn math a little LOL
Me, don't know about math really much but watch it until the end because of how good it was 🫡
When u take finn saying“mathematical” to serious
Euler is proud of you
It was the best math class ever.
Why is this the most fun I've ever had with math
how many time you make this??
I like your videos
modern way to teach math
😮
when the little e screamed  i just broke out into laughter lol
i'm curious how he got stuck in a calculator
Ok, I know that, according to Euler's Formula, e^(i*pi)=-1. At 1:49, the e takes out an i and puts it in front (reading left to right). This becomes ie^(i*pi) = -i   or... -1i. Both mean the same thing. I find it funny that because the i is an imaginary number, the e took that imaginary number and went to an imaginary realm. lol
I hope that Animation VS Math will come out as a series because this video expresses boring mathematics in animation and expresses it in a fun way😊
This video teach us how beautiful math is
Why the e scared the guy
Le dire a mi profe de matemáticas/física que vea este video a ver si lo entiende mejor
That was the coolest math animation I've ever seen! ^^
🗿🤙🏻 kerja bagus
It2
hes smarter than me
After watching it like 3 times I just realised the big thing on the end is Aleph Null infinity
Just think about how much time this video should have taken to be finished  Edit: I'm truly amazed by the animation, it's really great. I admire so much the fact that Alan Becker can create a whole story about these stick figures even with the most underrated subject
Bruh
when i review for an exam this will forever be my imagination
thats to shw how math is so dam hard
Dang! I never thought math could be that exciting! That was amazing, as always, Alan! Now I want to learn to animate as well! :)
7229 is the awnser to the+end
I do not understand the things orange does
THIS. IS.  A W E S O M E
😵
Damn how'd bro make math interesting
Why do i have transformers and call of duty vibe?
1:40 Wait what
Now imagine what will happen if Chosen One meets Baba
After I saw this video, I believe that bro is a mathematician disguised as an animator.
Me during math:
Man I wish you could just fiddle around with math stuff like this
i mean this is excactly why stickmen dont do math
I want to see a maths expert to react to this!
THIS IS AMAZINGG❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
only alan becker can turn math into a  hole fight
Linear algebra was about to defeat calculus, but linear algebra saved calculus at the last moment  Yeah no that’s true love
Small brain gang  | \/
The big variable that looks like an N, the name of that is Aleph(Ah•luheh•f).
Fun fact! The equation at 0:20 is actually correct! Alan has great attention to detail
:0
WOW
math is easy work smart not hard
Keren sih sumpah
GG orange
Make animation vs science
increible
Bro taked maths can be fun to seriously
At 1:20, I thought he was going to change the sign to 100 (does not equal symbol) 100 and break reality.
orange FINALLY discovered math
Algebra be like
Math is always evil
La mejor clase de matemáticas de la vida
Well the way that orange was discovering the basic operations and formulas of math is a very visual way to see mathematics and i loved it
Next vid: Animation vs. Science
this is so well made
Use ÷ ∞ it will divide any number to 0 or × 0
When this was first announced, I had no idea how it was going to play out, and yet (and just like all of your other animations), I am enthralled with excitement by watching it, and it's one of my many favourites of your videos. :)
yo the whole video track gives me tron vibes..less go 🤣
Im waiting to animator vs animation ep2
Dang bro nice work i could watch this all day
bros so good he made me want to study maths
my brain hurts
Ohhhh my gld
This was probably the most imaginative thing I've seen on YouTube ever! Even after finishing an AP calculus course I struggled to keep up with the math references, but every single detail was meticulously mathematically correct as far as I could tell. Great job!
In case nobody knows what that weird graph is at the end that is aleph from the Hebrew alphabet and math.
Is that aleph , zeta , delta and phi in the end?
My man really said "math is fun" 👏
How he get there
El verdadero, matemáticas es un juego
Can we just talk about the soundtrack God damm it hard
10:00 every elden ring boss:
Waaaa that may make you soo mutch time calcul animated with reac live calcul infinit with everything damm it was great work but math ,? Gona be a animated vs multivers infinit ? Soon? Idk a math vs other school stuff we need to know like english imagine math vs word
this is by far one of the most creative things I have seen you do. Only you could take something like math and turn it into something beautiful. Great work!
I never knew math was this powerful and dangerous
1+1= Olive Young Sale
This is amazing
YESSSSSSS ITS OUT!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i want this teacher
The fun that you can have when you can make your imagination come to life.
The fact that i actually know half this is astonishing
ok how the hell did we get from minecraft to constructing orbital laser cannons with math
I’m most def showing this to my math teacher
it was easy until 1+1+1
1+1= Math, im a genius.
Bro add metamorphosis 🔥🔥
HOW DARE YOU MAKE MATH COOL
This seriously may be one of the best animations you’ve ever done. It is rendering me speechless.
The way they kept coming back to Euler’s number through different complicated math topics is fascinating. Great video!
Where even is Orange he's supposed to be on a computer!
1+1=3 😎
my mind is slowly getting destroyed... and i just wanna be a business man
Aleph in Hebrew: :) Aleph in Math: 💀
me in mom phone: and of course I'm using my mom calculator
My guy learned math the hard way😂
This is perhaps the coolest visual representation of math I’ve seen in my life
People who loves maths will wath and understand this
Please do hindi vs animation
I wouldn’t have flunked math if it was taught like this.
Very good vemio 😅😂
If only regular math was so entertaining
el profe de mate: las matemáticas son faciles  Las matemáticas cuando 1+1 es igual a 11:
Well 1+1 is 11 cuz theres no =
1 +1 11 not 1 +1   2
After rewatching this for the, fifth time today, did I only just realize that at 12:26, Orange was spelling out "exit"
The fight was epic and the ending is a little sad and wholesome for me😊
Loved every second of this but was anyone else waiting for the 0 divided  by 0 nuke?😂
Why Eulett is Bad??
Never would’ve imagined that Alan could make me enjoy revisiting math lessons.
I can’t think of what to say to express how I feel about this, one of the only times this has ever happened. All I can say is this man is a genius, one of the best creators on the whole platform maybe even the internet as a whole, hell yeah actually the internet as a whole. Keep it up Alan.
Me speedrunning math so i can play games: GOTTA GO FAST
2+2+2+2+2= 22222
Bro imagine next year some math teacher would actully let there student see this
is not 11 is 2
1+1=11 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I.m gonna learning math in this video
e CUTE!
Bro its cool and confused at the same time
I wouldnt be suprised if The Second Coming manipulated these equations/formulas to get out of jail and go back to Alan's Computer
and now, let's show this to math teacher
This video is insane wow
How math is after i miss one day of class -
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
me be like watching this I don't understand now
The classes are aced, the teaching mind gets maced.
Mr. Becker, this video is absolutely phenomenal. You have killed my boredom with interest.
As someone who loves math and is going into pre-calc, i love this video. I cant stop rewatching it lol
Cant wait for Animation vs The US government
WMD. Weapon of math destruction
speed run asian, frfr no cap
This is like TETRIS'D but math.
This is how they should teach math in school: a virtual math sandbox
100+100 is 100100.
also at 13:45. you can see aleph null but it blending in like the backround
Bro this is crazy
This is cool but can you make animation vs history
Holy crap
Til so many new math symbols
Oh my absolute God this is amazing! like all this math has been simplified so well that it's actually mesmerizing to watch
Only Alan could make math look this fun.
And this is why ppl are good at math in these days
I'm not bothering to check, but I would bet real money (if I had any) that all that math was probably right.
Me atraparon es cine 🗿
I'll take this to teach my son math 😊
Amazing
0:32 what is he doing
Math is something I cannot predict
It was all so clear… yet then confusing.. And yet, it still was an immersive and amazing video. To use real dang equations for *weapons* just literally blew my mind. Who thinks of this?!  Alan and his team does!  I wont remember it, but I did learn about math easier in a few minutes than ever before. Also SC is dang smart! I knew he was creative, but I guess he aint the ‘Second Coming/Chosen’ for nothing!
best fight ever seen!!
10:32 ORANGE MAKES THE FLIPPING DEATH STAR!!!!!!!
better than spider verse
1+1 = 3!!!   ♀️+♂️ = ♂️Children♀️
Bruh, man, that's amazing. Alan, you are the best animator who I know. Do make such masterpieces more often. There are great idea and brilliant realization.
very good
orange learned all types of math faster than any human ever could
Mind blowing 😎
How is this bro so smart
I want more pls
Interested to see a version about either physics or chemistry
This is a cinematic masterpiece
I may have stopped understanding the math about 4 minutes in, but holy crap was this amazing. Not to mention how breathtaking the sound/music design was and the visuals to go along with it!! I’m just absolutely blown away, amazing work you guys! 🤍🧡🖤
yea
I can't imagine how long this took but it's so cool, you managed to make math cool
13:35
Orange is really smart thought
Teacher: Alright class today we’ll be learning more about algebra and mathematics.  My Brain: 8:37
It's 2 😂😂😂
el hombre cuando descubrio los números
1+1=3
Let's be honest orange sees somethings boring and make it fun cool or too overpowered
The animator turned simple maths into war💀
Legitimently felt longer the first time
This was amazing
경이롭다 인테그랄 휘두를 때부터 소름이 쫙 돋았다
Bro just show what i learned in an entire school year in 20 minutes
ay, mi mente
Did he just.. *Calculate the infinite radius of Pi..?*
THIS IS MY FAV EPISODE NOW
POV: Alan's Math Teachers watching this video
이영상을 수포자도 좋아합니다
oh im hoping E=mc2 would be there lol
wow
Math is too hard, I feel your pain orange
im pretty sure if some math teachers look a this video, they might be proud of @alanbecker. principals too tbh
1+1 is 2
2
the next short better be animation vs khan academy
this is super cool!
Damn. 12 hours and 2 million views. 😮
Okay but when he gets hit by a negative sign and it turns him around actually made me laugh
In my opinion I think e^i π can solo goku
Ok, hold up, Alan Becker tells incredible stories via stock figures, but this has to be one of the most impressive videos yet
The only question I have is what the heck is going on?
aaaa,my brain
Mathematics X Animations amazing... Now you made me interested in math which supposed I wasn't indeed to be curios though
hi
WHAT IS THIS eiㅠ?
It’s like when that one dumb brain cell try’s to learn math and hates it lol
I have no idea what’s going on here, you lost me when algebra got involved lol, but the animation is spectacular!
e
THERE IS A GIANT STICKMAN AT THE ENDING
This was incredible. Soooo many hidden details in this animation. I really want to see some math YouTubers review it
Why I hate math
now we need "animation vs music"
This might possibly be the coolest thing I've seen all year.
Love the math aspect of the animation. Alan made math fun to learn.
Legend math be like 1+1=11
How about Alan VS PUBG?
From SC doing equations for fun to SC fighting with variable using operators and numbers is just crazy creative
Awesome So it is a composition by a hardworking maths nerd and an animator.
My brain is not responding
this is 1 lesson
Never did I think that I would be so enthralled by the letter e and an orange stick
Amazing
"The numbers mason what do they mean?"
obra prima, gostei muito teve der temorado muito
Animation vs Megaman (from NES)

This was an oddly hypnotic experience.
❤
The best math video you can find on the internet. Period.  Can't state how much I appreciates this animation. Keep up the good work :D
I need a part 2 maybe even a whole season of this
The new avm
Всем привет и сегодня я стану киберспортсменом по калькулятору
I'm sure a lot of Mathematicians will react to this one for sure
Alan you have 2 choices what next video to make Animation Vs Minecraft Episode 32 Or animator vs animation  2
Me after watching this and knowing I will fail in the future. 🗿
Please make series teaching maths out of it❤ Some kind of web series, with episodes coming out weekly
Yo alan You should make Animation Vs Roblox!! Pretty please 🥺🥺🥺
thay gotta change "find e" into "catch e"
Tsc made the hammer of dawn
Animation vs physic?
Nice the+end = endthe?
tbh tsc is the most powerful character and pretty much the main one  he literally changed 1 = 1 into 1 + 1 = 2  so hes using black magic
bprp love this video
Muy excelente video. Como me gustan las matemáticas me encanto bastante y pude entender algunas cosas.
Oh no! Not 6/0!!
Better than a math class
I was worried the e was going to use E=mc 2 and 'legalised Nuclear Bombs' To combat the orbital strike orange was given
Newspapers are extremely human
Everyone knows when Alan uploads, its a good day.
Of course terkoiz would think of something of this caliber and make it freaking incredible to watch
watching this as a twelve year old is awesome because I have no idea whats going on but it looks cool and I understand that its correct
How in the world did he creat a new form of solving math
1+1=10
Wow amazing !!!!!!!
I love Alan friend you are a genius, I love how you created an entertaining animation with something that people do not like (I personally like math) Now can someone be so kind as to tell me the name of the music?
please
Cute e :)
hey alan continue the animator vs animation series
10:42 Deathstar🗿
And it all started with a single number, 1.
this is how math should be taught
if only math was this fun.
I love math now
谢谢！
Wen esta en un examen de matematicas mi mente:
Que emoción un video nuevo de Alan y todos sabemos  2+2=🐟  Eres muy talentoso, muy buen animador y un ejemplo a seguir asi❤🎉  Saludos desde Colombia <3
The + End = kết thúc
I´ve learned more in this video than in school
I dont like the fact that a stickman knows more math than me in a couple of seconds
я не понимаю что сейчас люди писали в чате но хочу сказать то что я освоил математику всего за 15 минут 😅
every math teacher should show this as an introduction to make it seem cooler
Animation vs Biology
Damn man please stop i'm going insane after this one
GG
Epic.
Dream math teacher be like:💀 a war
This video is epic!
Bro really created math lore
outstanding per the norm. can't wait for more.
who's that big guy at the end?
this is your New Animations
next topic of animation is animation vs forgotten pc games plzzzz
This was amazing! (Math enthusiast, though I don't know enough to be a proper nerd.) Someone show this to Grant Sanderson of 3 Blue 1 Brown! He does math visualizations on YT, and I think this is right up his alley.
Math surely is one of the hardest enemies he fought
This is epic😮 I hope there will be a (Animation vs. Math part 2)
Once again, Alan delivers a masterpiece.
that's a crazy syllabus
4:52 I can't believe it, tsc made a bow using the equation 2 x 2 = ? And it shoots out 4, that's so good and so stupid (in a good way)
eres un genio
THAT WAS AMAZING good job!
Star Wars vs Star Trek
just... perfect.
Pov me who knows only the answers at the beginning
Wow, alef nole is big
OMGGG
math lore fr
The most amazing and awe inspiring way to explain math. I think you may have created a few new mathematicians 😂
this stick man is better than math teacher
Why you not creat a wanted animetion😢😢
Amazing! Just amazing!
Bro just turned himself into Waterblight Ganon!?!!?  9:53
The way math departments around the world are gonna nerd out so hard lmao  I can't wait for a sequel where they step into some of the higher plane geometric ideas like graphing a multi dimensional matrix and having TSC step into 6 spacial dimensions!
So HeartWarming
Chắc mình tui  from vietnam quá:v
I knew most of it until I saw 2
Best Math class ever!!!!!!
If only math has 2.0 update and have sfx like these when I was still in school.
I hate math
2+2=fish
Not all the kids typing “🤓”
This video make me geek stupid
this is orange's pov in the prison i can feel it
mi profe de matemática vs mi profe de animacion........
Gotta become a math major fully understand this video
an aleph being depicted in a similar way to eternity in the marvel comics is so clever
As a grade 6 math student. This is really entertaining and right math. You also did the terminating repeating decimal
Bro just made math cool
The battle of Harvard vs Yale math
Second coming vs Math
Im just vibing to the music
When I say I love math,I mean this.
How tf did he make math cool
Calculus is more of a foreign language than math
Know that
It is 100
Bro just made the best way to learn math 100%
omg so cool the best film
No
Do physics
This is getting orange ready for his new foes ❤❤❤
it would be funny if the appearance of riemann zeta function actually foreshadowed "Animation vs Math 2" being about the search for the non trivial zeroes lol
plus,minus,times,divide,through the power of,square root,fraction,pi,radius,point(.),pi(advanced),golden ratio,
Bruh 1+1=2 dumbass comment
Apparently we have to love math.
When Alan Was Studying MTK Be Like :
As a person in AP Calculus, this animation was simply astounding!!!
this video thought me more than school
Part 2
Oh god math is now haunting me even here
I learned Math just from this
I have a theory that when TSC is taking his daily nap (or more) his dreams go to strange places like this one. That could explain the black background. (Note that this is just a theory I came up with.)
This is what u wish math was while sitting in math class
2
THIS is how you teach math!
Is this animation before or after AVA IV?
Aunque estuvo epico  No entendí mi nichi xd😅😅
students : i hate math, when do i need math? math is boring! Alan Becker : Animation vs. Math students : i love math i can use math to solve all my problems like if im in another dimension i can use math to build a portal back home :D
SO SICK😁
1+1= eleventeen
yay! new video
Wait…. That’s not how theta works.
Why can’t math class be like this
This was so pleasing to watch
you managed to make math interesting
Otimo video cara ficou muito bom
This video is just about how e just pop up everywhere unprompted in math.
But is it canon
Do you work on animation vs animation?
Leaving a comment ❤
huh  elemental plane of logic
I haven't even studied yet Ω
Here for those legend who don't know math
I could follow along for 7 minutes, minus any time Euler's Identity showed up because I did not know that.
this is genius
quite awesome lore addition
As a man with a A+ in math i say pi is delicious
Bro gave me the intire life math class in 15 mins
AAAAH MY BRAIN IS 0,999... = 1 NOW
Yay 14hrs ago
2
math nerds be like this best video ever
math is my most favorite subject  + -  ×  ÷ x² y× () [] {} equation = x y z fraction summation intergal logarithm exponential functions function decimal geometry trigonometry pi i and yeah.
Mmmm 1+1 es 11 😝😝😝
form of calculation 🧐😮‍💨
2
No it 2
i luv this vid bcs i love maths
those number falling are so sastifiying
It's confusing
Bro became my math teacher💀
This video is the funniest one
Yes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
After i watch this i understand why teacher gave me home work
Bruh 1+1=3 everyone know bro
Can we collab?
OUH, MY, GOSH!!!  THIS IS AWESOME!!!
Bro went from 1 + 1 to things i dont know in math
Wait, so, 1+1 is 2?
I wish math was this interesting and cool.
uhh my brain was broken
Why is The Second Coming in a black void?
Dude. If my teacher shows us this in one of my lessons i'm going to pass my next exams.
As someone about to take exams on complex numbers and specialised math: best revision material ever!!! ❤
this feels like I am watching a sci-fi animation. Good job Alan
This is amazing! 🔥🔥
Bro solos all of math
bro just watching this i thought that this was math test and i was in school again 💀
Animation vs Language!!
This like the coolest movie ever
As a maths nerd, I can confirm that I trully enjoyed this video. Well done, Alan!
It's a good thing that he didn't try to divide by 0. It could've opened a black hole.
Alan made you watch a full video of math. I know, im surprised too.
reference the gman
I didn't understand anything but i loved it
My 1Dimensional brain cant handle this kind of shit...
1+1-2
My brain watching this is all HUH!
I have never seen anyone having fun with math
OH MY GOD THEY KILLED THE SECOND COMING!!!
Hey, this is the funniest mathematics video for everyone! All countries around the world should include this video for mathematics curriculum :D
I need you to make a movie about it
Bro, I instantly teach my math teacher with just watching this video (no joke) 💀.  Wait, now Im becoming Math nerd🤓
13:54 = The_End
This video is usefull to learn math with fun
BRO LEARNED FROM GRADE 1 TO EVERYTHING IN 2 MINS💀
Wish I could go from learning simple additions to whatever the heck I just saw
Orange made an entire exam
This feels like typoman adventures but maths and on crack
12 year old me with a calculator
Wow... I have no idea what any of this means...
Ok now we need the whole crew to see that
This is the most math lesson ive ever had!
Hermoso me encantan todos los capítulos y serie!❤❤❤
that was tripy nut great
If only i had a gun made of math
This hurt my brain
11+5=4
cinema
this is cool
No one's talking about when orange is shooting the bow you can see the bow is made of two 2s a × and a = and that is why  it shoots out 4s
You have to have a headache
How has he made math fun?!
X:Matematicas es facil😂 Matematicas💀
Why is an א in the end?
This video for kids.
Pay attention guys!! This is how you find e...!!
9-10=-9
1+1+1=3
This was so cool imagine if you did a second in but it incorporates music because music comes from math
Everyone knows 1+1=11
This makes me want to go learn math again 😂
That was awesome
Bruh this video helped me on my math exam lol Also thank you and awsome video
W animation
Tsc explain math in 14minutes 02 seconds Also i didnt expect that it made me felt excited more on math
And people call math a boring subject.
movie companies need to hire this man
orange used his minecraft skills to make a bow with numbers
maths & animation❤❤❤
please make part 2
❤❤❤❤
MMMM Math
This animation is GENIUS! And so entertaining too! Alan Becker never fails to impress! :D
14 hours to 1.4million wews holy sh*t u re mining f*ckin wews dud u re f*ckin mining holy sh*t u re almost perfect
10:57
maluquisse
THAT WAS THE COOLEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
Fun way to learn mathematics
Now this is pure art, I'm crying
for the first time, theres a voice in Alan Becker's videos, except his voice i guess?
Se o Alan fosse meu professor de Matemática não perderia nenhuma aula!❤
1+1 majelan
Math lore
Why does the choosen one not like him?
OH NO NOT THE MATH
yes, the way he taught math to the point where it amazed Albert Einstein
9+10=21
e^iπ what?
Wait soooo..  Whats the answer?
1 + 1 = *SOPROLE*
2 0:24
Ok, now it's time for Animation vs. Meth
He learned the whole essence of this universe...........     (But I did not understand anything)
So that's why six was afraid of seven...
JODER ESTO SI ES CINE 📽
I love your animations
this video made me have an existential crisis
too much for my brain
ใ
bro turned maths into an intense fight with the 10th grade math💀💀💀💀
oh ok
did anything make sense after the 4th minute? no. but did i watch the whole thing ? yes
Orange Made An New Freind 😊
Holy, it's fantastic.
1337 /1 = 1337
You lost me with Fourier lmao
Bro taught me faster than school 💀
Bro was the best youtuber
10:00 e: *_UEEEEEEE!_*
My only recommendation would be to have pi first appear at 3:14. But otherwise, this was absolutely fantastic.
I’m in grade 9 this year and i gotta say I don’t know 90% of what’s in the video😐
Baldi: This is Aaaaammmmaaaaazzzziiiiiiing Animation🤩
Me facing my arch enemy:
Top
The orange one is good at math I'm impressed
Si entendiera todo estaría 100
Это гениально
The fact that this all could've been avoided if TSC just asked nicely.
If you look at it this way, math is beautiful.
as a math nerd myself, i can confirm that this is what i wanted animation vs math to be like  Edit: holy cow, 300 likes! thank you all! also, for those asking, the symbol at the end is an aleph, which, according to @mono2515 in the replies, is the first symbol in the hebrew alphabet, and describes a level of infinities, hence why it is so large
Minecraft be like
I just subscribed
this video looks like human discovering math (exept for the "e" encounters which i dont even know what is)
I feel like Alan just made a breakthrough with this video. Something about it is so good. How it teaches the basics, and then gets more complicated. How it goes from clever action sequences, to just learning math without worrying about anything else, along with it being pitch-black the whole time. The whole thing is so surreal, and that's what I love about it the most. It's also very high-quality and you always find time to slowly introduce the viewer to what things you can do, along with every other video you made. Great job, honestly, and even though you might've reached your peak content years ago, you still never fail to amaze us to this day. I don't know what else to say, thank you.
The owner of the channel achieves mathematics.
alan has solved math education videos in the span of 14 minutes
Yellow would be having a field day in this video
1+1=????? 1+1=2😂😂😂😂
10:34 wow a literally referenced Death Star amazing
Pov: How to get over your fears of math
Ay wey mi mente 😱
20:00
I just studied complex numbers, and I got 50% of those references.   This will be probably peak usefulness of this subject
Learning math. But cooler
11:07 If you're Malaysian, it looks like a reference to the finale of BoBoiBoy Galaxy.
POV: My dream before my math exam.
How to love Maths.
10:55 bro decided to pull the final flash
99+11=100
TSC is us when taking a math test.
This could be a way to learn math to
bro explain everything in math than my teacher💀
99+99?
Finally all those math classes are useful
1+1=3
Alan is literally math god
So the second coming are strong enough to control the number and delete it at the same time,also can break the world?Dang...
Math has never been coller frfr
@just_baggy it's wrong dude
Animation vs. Meth😏
Animation vs. running out of ideas
truly is the age of discovery
1+1 is 3 bruh
The animations are so smooth when TSC are making equations :)
Bro thought he was tony Stark
11:00 did bro made a death star from math
Alan Becker disappearing after his yearly post
Amination solo vs math
Why didnt he just try and divide 0 by 0?
Animation Vs Computer Programming Languages Please😅😻
bro i have a theory  what if all the thing like   this math episode  mario   the games like pac man and space invators  minecraft  and others  what if its just like undertale..  timelines.............  tho i can be wrong due to my theory
私は日本人ですがアランベッカーさんの動画はとても好きです
Math checks out
I feel smart for understanding whats happening 🤓
This Man needs an Oscar for the Content that hes Making
8 year old me on the calculator while the math teacher rambles on about multiplication or smthn idk:
This is way beyond my comprehension. I feel as though the battles themselves even had meanings. Problem is, I'm already having trouble trying to process how you guys animate your other videos, I can't even begin to understand this masterpiece. Good job
(\_/) (  •.•) /      \_1+1 is 11+50=I wish alan Will get 50M sub soon❤
A strange world.
When math cooler when you
I learned more math in this video than I have learned in my 10 years of school
Не так я себе первый урок алгебры в 9 классе представлял 💀💀💀
よき
"what was you favorite part of the math video Jimmy?"  "I liked the part where the stick figure made the hammer of dawn and massacred the E's"
why don’t math teachers just play this video instead of teaching
OMG
Imagine a Stickman That uses math as his ability
M
Orange is trying to create that calculating meme where you're thinking to find the answer and those numbers are coming out of your head or thin air, (like I said, that calculating meme.).
I wish i could hit and move and click numbers and symbols like he is
Allen I had a dream about you some reason
I never liked math... I loved it
THE EVOLUTION OF MATH
Orange is the albert einstein now?...'or nicola tesla'
I've always think that math is closest thing we have to magic in real world, it help us understand how our world works..
Math if it was epic
damn
I swear this man is the only person on this planet who could make math fun.
Damn I really need tsc from my math lesson
So cool
Terkoiz... Alan... HOLY SHIT *THIS IS FUCKING AMAZING*
1-1
Absolute genius
.
A+A
How to make math entertaining:
Honestly, this just shows how powerful TSC REALLY is in math form
You videos always make me smile
Okay when the break is over I need to show this to my math teacher.
Amazing!❤
He has found the new power.
my brain:☠️
i have no idea what half of this is but, THERE WAS A TIMES ZERO GUN WTF
What is the song used please ?
It's official, math is my true nightmare
Oh yeah definitely am going to show my math teacher this
Best way to learn math
Yeah... how do they say? Oh yes! "the power of math"
The thumbnail😂
Who knew math can be interesting
let hin cook
math theachers should show this to students
Multiplica lo por 0
How did second coming get here in the first place?
not gonna lie when  say that this video helped me pass my algebra exam
195+188=195188
Bro is smarter than Albert Einstein💀💀💀
alan casually make math lore without us noticice
. I ead😊
That was FUCKING AMAZING. It was so amazing that I genuinly feel bad that I wasn't one of your channel members while this was being created.  I loved every second of watching this video.
No entendí pero me gustaron los numéritos jajaa
The most hard math for me is additional mathematic
That was quite crazy cool!
I knew around 4/3 of this math
u should make a "Animation vs science"
This was amazingly creative. I loved it.
Imaginate un videojuego asi, todos estarian averiguando los combos.
I was gonna say that this has to be very creative for something like Math to be in a cool animation  Of course  How could I doubt Alan Becker’s creativity  This was an awesome animation  Keep it up
my brain not connecting to this video
this is how me and my math homework treat eachother
genio
Everything is = to 21 in the twilight zone
e^iπ = -1?
I fully believe this video should get an award.
My mind isn't minding Alan what have you done
1+1 is obviously Magellan.
Some people: Math is boring.  This video: Allow me to introduce myself.
That went from "ok, that's cool" to "damn that's really cool"
The power of knowlege
What 9+10?
Most fun way of doing math:
woow
i am actually lost for words on this
Should have added metamorphodis song
i am a math nerd and i did not understand the 70% of the math 😭
Dude can always make anything into a boss fight
I found it interesting the fact that all these math accounts, additions, subtractions, divisions, multiplications, expressions, square roots, prime numbers and compounds etc. Easy or difficult, giants or small ones.    They all occurred because of the number 1           By the way, I'm from Brazil, I was born in Paraná, Curitiba, in 2012.     I spent a long time putting this in the translator o be able to comment in a way that Americans understood.     Even if I am from a country different from Alan, I would like to say that I admire your work a lot, the videos are amazing , and that you always keep improving your work more and more. Congratulations Alan Becker.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGHHHHHHH
2+2=22
the death star 10:44
Sai rồi là hai
My brain be like 🤯
Just awesome.thank you
So, question. How is this connected to the rest of the world?
Never thought I would be so interested in math
I got chills all over my pants, there is no way I just enjoy math fight and was liking it, now I want to go back to my professor and tell him all about this but I would be brand as crazy person probably  Best movie I watch today
Plot twist: it all happened in alan's calculator app and the other stickfigures just sit in sofa watching the fight with popcorns
what is 10+9?
No 1+1 =3
Mindblowing 😮 Great work Alan 🎉
ko bt cs ai ng việt ko
Y por qué no creo multiplicaciones del🧐🧐🧐
(°O°)
Alan over here teaching math, thank you.
You good at math
damn, i just got called dumb in 72 different ways
bro graduated school with war💀
Bro's teaching me better than my math teacher
???
It always amazes me what alan can do with the most boring mundane things like math keep up the good work dude
How is it that every one of your videos are bangers
1+1=2
by how vast math equations are and its coolness of its complexions, there should be a continuity of this masterpiece especially reaching physics level.. i will literally lose my mind if he meets the ancient mathematicians🥶🔥
Oh my FUCKING god their Is so much math
I was watching this thinking "wow this gives the same vibes as that old animation of stickman vs animator back on Newgrounds". I look at your profile and it is you wow.
😮 а куда пропал 5 и 1 ребята
if this was an actual app of an calculator i would definitely want it
1+1=11 No No 1+1=10 yes yes
what's the music called
This is by far………the most mind-blowing video I’ve ever seen in Alan Becker videos so far😆🔥🥶‼️  Too bad I won’t get to see the destructive power of 0➗0 cuz that would be even awesome if this was included in the video 👍🏻🤩
really cool
Amazing!!!!
like si lloraste
NO ENTENDIIIIII
Every math teacher lore:
No it two and it said it bro
Suiii
Dude sleep in a calculator
1+1= 0 🇲🇽 💥
Can any math professionals confirm?
😳
🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mmmmmath
Bro thought me math faster then my teacher teach me english
I felt powerful knowing what the hell was happening during the math parts
1+1=11
if math was explained to me like this. I will literally pursuit being a math teacher LOL
O nays shahiryor aka zorakan ku bunisi kirdizmi
Math is trying to kill you
I SPOT ALEPH-NULL AT THE END! OR AT LEAST ALEPH!!!! GOD THIS WAS SO AMAZING
math became fun be like:
If my math teacher was this guy i think i would not be bored in my math class anymore
Every math teacher’s favorite video
How to lose 300,000 brain cells every milliseconds
What happen to tsc?
bro this is the history of math
The math test will be easy  :=*the math test*
me with my calculator in class
That sound is soo crunchy
This.... is pure art, oh my god, the work behind it... I love it, I'm not even gonna complain if the math is correct or not, i don't know if it is, but i'm pretty sure it is <3
This is the type of video that would be cool and educational 😂
I love these animations and this one was amazing
Me gustò esta animaciòn, debido a que es bastante diferente a cualquier otra que haya visto (incluyendo otros canales), un enfoque bastante novedoso por asi decirlo y que es bastante inesperado para muchas personas, gran trabajo sigan asi!
My brain can’t process
This video is math lore right here 🗿
Sun
Aaaaaah He keeps changing the equations
ngl this hurts my head
las matematicas son malas XD
Everyone knows 1+1 is not 11 its 2
Perfect video
this is like the final battle of tengen toppa gurren lagan
😮😮😮😮афигеть😮😮😮
2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
As a student of physics, i've got to say: that's so funny and beautiful! Like, that's it's really like math is done with the visualization of the conceptes and with creativity to think, create and solve functions, sometimes with geometry representations of it! I didn't know that we could such a animation about "Math" and that this could be made out for a combat and further, that we can learn and demonstrate while watching and having fun with. Really, it's one of your bests works!
This is actually fun
the fact it sounds soo futuristic makes me wanna go *wow!*
Alan is the only person who can make math actually look fun 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
This video make my brain broken
Teacher: we’re having a test now the test:
Que buen trabajo ases ojala tengas buen futuro:)
bruh bro trying like an einstein
this was honestly amazing
Wait is no one talking about he made the death star from star wars at the final fight?
As a certified nerd, I’m in love with this
Next, Animation vs. Physic🔥
MATH IS COOL
imagine the biq and iq of this stickman 😭
CONGRATSON GETTING THIS ON #4 ON TRENDING

Cómo pueden hacer que una animación de stickmans quede tan bien? Muy bueno!!!  Edit: Esto antes decía "Cómo puede una sola persona animar tan bien?" pero lo cambié porque me hicieron recordar que son un equipo xDDD
The team did really good and the sound design is so damn good it is all very satisfying and engaging.
ЭТО ПРОСТО КРУТО (я на математике *мысли *)
1+1 are winsdow
Me playing with the hard mathematics on the calculator
Alan wers the part 2 of the chousenwan and orang
this guy should become a math teacher
Why was that the most mindblowing video I've seen all year? Everything I remember from high school and college......used as weapons, teleporters, and orbital bombardments.
I dont know other maths but how with that many number? that made     me kinda jealous fr
This is taking numerical theory to another level
1+1 is 25
alan turned everyones hated subject to a badass animation
alan turned everyones hated subject to a badass animation
all math should be expressed like this
Equals th2end
Math aint so boring any more aint it
this has better animation and storytelling than darling in the franxx
Kudos to the animator for doing all this math stuff cuz all of this is hurting my brain
Alan has my imagination of e being a head
No its 2
Ah, Alan can turn math into epic battle, what a great job:)
9×9=83
Hello
I've never paused a video this much
Make a part 2
someone explain to me why eulers formula is running away from an orange man
O pesadelo de todo o estudante
My sis is bad at P6 math and i told her U know avm Animation vs Minecraft right? She said yes then i told her WE HAVE ANIMATION VS MATH NOW
The Hebrew Aleph at the end. א
I didn't think I would like math so much haha
Que es esta tremenda hermosura que grande no me espere un video de matematicas tan bueno
five divided by zero = infinity
when you dont understand what youre watching but youre still amazed:
This may sound dumb but how does an animation vs. chemistry sound?
Ain't no way math just got interesting
TSC made a death star using math
TheEnd
That was amazing!!! I loved the various references to mathematics and although I couldn't understand it all it was so cool (especially the parts where he uses pure math as a cannon).
1 + 1 = window!
Man's just made my year in algebra 3 look like it was childs play
Anyone noticed the giant aleph null in the background at the end?
can't wait for Mathematicians' reactions
School
Okay tsc is scientist
Anyone else feel like this is animator vs animation VI ep2? I know it might not be but it just makes sense to me, a mind space that is used to contain powerful beings
We NEED a reaction video from a pro math teacher watching this!
just learned math now time to graduate
This actually makes math fun
4:44 TSC: THE POWER OF PLUS COMPELS YOU
Ah yes E scream for EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
not bad
9:06 shouldn't the radius be perpendicular to the circumference?
He must be really smart to do this cuz this is a lot of math😅😅
1+1=2
Out of goddamning math. How is this even possible something that cool out of this topic?
There needs to be a part two of this
Omg
1+1+1+1+110
Alan I get it, okay? You are Asian.
And now I like exponential^i×pi
Bro imagine an class and the teacher started playing Fps.Math
Ok.......................
I'm good at math But the animation makes it so weird
1+1 is 11 obvio
Stick man games steal your videos and make them ads alan becker
The ending shows Alpeh Null its to dark to see but light it up and u will see it!
Where the other stick figures
Man, it would be cool if math teachers showed this over here on the projector.
I need either a next part with aleph, or a game about this, a fighting game... that would really be epic
tsc learning about math lore edit: wait omg i just realized that this could add more power to tsc to hopefully help tco escape in animator vs animation
Bro just explained the entire math lore💀
What's 10+9?
The giant symbol at the end was aleph, an early notation for infinity.  It would have great if you included the Mandelbrot Fractal somehow.
wonderful
That death star laser was made from a math equation, but not technology.   He just found the key to saving himself and The Chosen One from Victim's organization
Whats the big symbol at the end??
1
1+1=2
+ is now the strongest weapon in the alanbeckerverse
2 + 2 = two two easy math
you know math alot alan
This will be an intuitive view of the math operations for me :)
"the problem is very easy, it'll be a piece of cake" the problem: 9:58
This dude actually made me enjoy math
Imagine how the fight will go after TSC learned the entire math
how did a stickman draw a perfect circle
This is some next level math
Tá de parabéns 👏🎉
would this be a canonical event?
KKKKKKKKKKKKK
idk marks
What is this magic?!
This is what i imagine when teacher says that math is fun
My brain isn't braining💀
Best math related video on the internet
Music is the one who making us feel like discover a new thing.  Always love your work
This is the best epic battle
Learn at schools ❌ Learn in this video ✅
Bro just showed the whole math in 14 minutes instead of 11 years💀
Nunber why robot
I love how this is animated dude! The way he’s animating how math mechanics work is  really simple to me.
It was my first time to think mathematics was such fun!
Plotwist: Alan made this to teach his kid math
im very much interestend on where those sound effects are from those are amazeing and i could do so much with them
now make animation vs alphabet plz
I finally understand math
Goood
bro what dimension is this?

Who knew math would be so entertaining to watch
pov: ur solving a math equation🤪🤪🤪💀
0 ÷ 0 = ☠️
1+1is111
How the hell did they turn *MATH* entertaining
This HAS to become a series, it just has so much potential 1. Explore more of the complex plane and the complex numbers. 2. Dive deeper into the relationship between algebra and geometry. 3. Different numerical systems, such as the p-adic numbers, the surreal numbers, the extended complex plane, etc.  4. More interesting mathematical constants such as the golden ratio. 5. Fractals such as the sierpinski triangle, the mandelbrot set, etc. 6. Polynomials, solving equations, finite and infinite series, convergent and divergent series.  7. Calculus, explore more of integrals, derevitives, the exponential function, chain rule, etc.  8. Non-euclidean geometry, geometry that doesn't obey all of Euclid's postulates, warped space, different tessellations, etc.
Hi
I pray that one day in schools a math teacher with show this video in class.
This is some of the best animating I have EVER seen. Good job!!!
Come on make the ragdoll video really 🎉
It more more better than  whole dr strange movies
The math problem lol
Kinda failed complex analysis😬
Incrível! Perfeito! Genial!
pls make part 2 🥺
Ma brain is broken
It would be funny if he came out of the calculator app and everyone else wondered what happened to him
𝟙+𝟙=𝟚 𝕓𝕦𝕥 𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟘𝟙-𝕀ℚ 𝟙𝟙
Imagine that some schools take this video to learn math to the student. Will it be awesome or just more complicated.
math lore
😮
NOOOOOO MY BRAINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i dont know maths 💀
hey alan becker those sound effects for the mega e dude man, were those from bluezone corporation
my ass is way to dumb for this shit istg
Anyone else want to ask their math teacher if the math is correct?
The things you do is amazing 😊
I kept up until about the 5 min mark
Idk man e as the villain?, damn he forgot about letter lore
Yep. Only followed the math to about the 4 minute mark. After that, it was all French. XD
i love algebra. im kinda a nerd when its come to math
세계관 최강자들의 싸움 이였다..
hi
Bros actually teaching kids
Some Small Details 5:29 this shows The Second Coming is approximately 1.65 units tall. An average adult male is 1.6~1.8 meters tall. It appears the math space is in SI units, m being the SI unit of length. This also shows TSC is about 165cm tall, or 5' 5". 7:45 a circle is represented as x^2 + y^2 = r^2. Inserting a pi turns it into the area of a circle, pi*r^2. Inserting 8 turns it into the volume of a cylinder, 8*pi*r^2. 9:01 since f(x) is 9*tan(x) and tangent turns angle into the steepness of a line, it can latch onto the unit circle. 9:40 f(dot) represents the tangent function at a given point (throughout this video, we can see a dot used as an arbitary number on the number line), and f(inf) represents the tangent function over the entire number line [0, +inf). An entire number line can be seen as a span of an unit vector, thus each shot increases the dimension of the span. This also implies that TSC is a being that is four-dimensional. 9:57 Sigma + limit = integral. If you try to derive the definite integral using the sum of rectangles method, you will eventually transform lim(sigma(f(...)) into integral(g(...)). 10:04 Calculating an integral of a function can be seen as getting the total (polar) area between the function and the number line. Thus the Integral Sword attacks with R2. 11:31 welcome to the imaginary realm. Hope you like it here.
PART TWO
1+1=3😂
Woah now math is interesting good job alan 😊!
this sounds so si-fi for some reason
Fais les autres matières svp (Histoire, Français...) J'ai adoré t'a vidéo 🥰
Good job Alan 👏 keep up the good work 👍🏼 I would love a heart from you ❤️
Мама заставляет учить математику. Мой сон:
how can i understand this but at the same time, not
This is cool
That was awesome
How do all the one plus ones equal 6×(2)? 😮
Why you not make 1/0 = error cannot drive by zero🤣
The sound design alone in this scratched that one part of my brain
Pov: you are bored so u decided to use ur moms calculator.
At what point did you stop understanding anything going on?
My dream when I fall asleep in math class
Alan should make a game out of math
:0
AAAAAAAAAA MY BRAAAIIIIIIIIIN
When you turn the calculator side ways
Es genial... juega con tu imaginación y tu cabeza, y enseña, amo ❤
cool wow
Not gonna lie Alan Becker is smarter than me👍👍👍🧠🧠🧠
😮
Never have I ever thought that I would think math could be cool...
11:06 bro pulled out death star 💀
Oh I hate math😢
Idk what I just watched but, was cool I guess.
The roll maths 😂
The + End = Finish Finish 🤔 No ( part 1 + part 1 = part 2 ) = i sad ( i ≠ ¿ × sad ≈ ! ) = ( e=mc² )
Everything is excellent but I have a question about the lore of this chapter, perhaps it is one of those like animation vs games where the canon does not cover but here the final portal matches the shape and textures than the portal that stick men use to go between dimensions (like that portal that takes them to the city) I really want to see their next creations
uM aCtUaLlY iT sHoUlD’vE bEeN tHe x EnD
Alan you are genius!
i legit forgot most of my math xd but ngl it does seem pretty interesting, someday i will come back to this with a new mind and see if i can understand the lore here
Waiting for animation Vs math part 2
Commenting a minute in, he's gonna try dividing by zero and break everything
Can someone explain the ending to me please? I have no idea about math
Talented
SECOND PART!
animation overcome the complex
i kinded of hope this can be use a bit in schools to get kids bit more interested in math be a fun day just figure out how the math works in this
Math game be like
so much e and i
Bro alan really explained math in 14 minutes better than my teacher in 6 years
What a tribute over math ❤❤
Me thinking math
somebody has to make this a game
Pls Animation vs Geometry dash
great stuff to learn
I stayed in 1+1
New  Albert Einstein
Guys shouldnt we make it a mission to make this vid known to all math Youtubers?
2
No baggy everyone knows 1+1=2
I learned more math in this video than from my 12 years of school
1+1 is 11 no equal
im getting STEM classes flashbacks from this ahahahaha
Yo Alan make a episode 2 when the chosen one and the second coming got paused
i think i seen this somewhere before
This is legitimately the best thing I've ever seen as a visualization of math concepts. I'm sure 3b1b/numberphile/minutephysics would love visualizations like this.
I would've passed math if they showed me this
When the math is too hard, so you just animate it:
The new series has begun....
good
Xd
i cant understand
I’m about to ace my math final after this
I’m about to ace my math final after this
make a part two because the big giant X remember at the end
Can we all just appreciate the fact that Alan is such an incredibly talented animator that he can make something as mundane as math look awesome?
how does one go about making an animation about math and make it HYPE AS HELL?!?!?! WHOA????!!!!!!
THIS IS INASE HOLY COW
No it’s 2
yay!
This has increased my fear for math
This is the most insane nerd battle I have ever seen
This video shows that you can make literally anything a badass short film if you have enough talent.
I learned a lot about math watching this
i love this mans animations please keep it up
1 + 1 without equal is 11
Propaganda do enem em forma de animação
:)
I NEED someone to make a fighting game with these abilities in desmos (the graphing calculator) or just in a game engine, I don't really care what its made in, I just need a game for this.
i created the math language
This made me cry because this reminded me everything I have seen between the first grade and 5th year, all the teachers I had and it made me nostalgic.
so cool
I feel like I learned more from this animation more than math lessons
so cool
Pls make a part 2
I learned more math from this than my school
so cool
alternate title : When you get a degree on mathematics, bu ended up working as an animator
"Two plus two is four Minus one that's three, quick maths" Shaq, Big
good 👍
My brain!!!
Brain me boom
nice
me at 8:43 WHAT IS THIS HALFLIFE!?!
Somebody should make a website where you can do math like this
My brain
YES LETS GO FINALLY!
Me during algebra be like: okay guys time to fight math!
:0
From a 1+1 to a what the hell is that
This was so cool I even sent it to my mother who's a retired math teacher. She liked it.
Second Coming literally speedran math than the rest of us, he could get a PhD first before we even graduated 💀
I NEED the soundtrack for this video 🙏🙏🙏
The fact that Alan made math interesting is beyond human imagination.
Don't tell me this what I'm gonna do in college 😫
cool concept 👍
the video shoud have ended from the start
1+1 es 938
Where is bro even at the void💀
It's is my worst night mare math
Before: i hate math Now: INTERESTING
Critics: Almost all famous YouTube videos are uneducational and time-wasting The video:
I'm fell stupid now
Học toán cùng cam 👍
bro the animation just so good and the way you combine that so smothhh:))))i like it
Good thing that my favorite subject is mathematics
Oh this is a math professior
Imagine showing this to ur math class presentation
I want the part 2!!!
Ρε αδερφέ τι έχεις φτιάξει 😂👍
guys remember one thing: 8+8 is super ocho
math can be complicated,       *in any kind of way*
Tremendo Albert Einstein
1+1=cute
Well, that escalated quickly! -Markiplier, i guess
perfect, as always
only Alan can make math entertaining
All the stick figure when the orange comes back   Oh where did you go?  Orange: I was fighting math with a rail gun.  What?
although i didnt understand some of the story (or math if im being honest) you still managed to do the impossible... you made math fun!!! 🤩🤩
Esto sí es estudiar
math test be like
This animation is just really satisfying
this guy’s creativity never ceases to amaze me
This math not for me
This is so much better then I could have expected, good job!
Is the last symbol thats shown the orange guy
Albert Einstein must see this 💀
1+1=1 and 1x1=2
I would love to see chemistry next
Man I got outsmarted by a stick figure 💀💀💀
Awesome vid like always
aight ima put this on my school group
Alan the way you visualized the math clicked some in my my for theoretical math and non-euclidean geometry
Because there is no =
Help i dont understand what is this
4:17 (-cos(π)+isin(π)) maybe
Excelente vídeo amigo!!
I'm mad that an orange figure with a clear head is smarter than me.
Math is terrifying.
well that's one way to make math fun. 😂
2+2=4 te puse
if only i can jump into my math homework and beat the shit out of it
Cant wait for next episode: animation versus the concept of time
I feel like you'd need to be a mathematician to fully appreciate this video
orange becoming smart lol😆
Man I can’t wait to watch a breakdown of this by some science channel
Bro learned more math in 10 mintues than the whole school system taught us in 12 years
Alternate title: Alan Becker making his stick figure teach me more math than school ever did.
I didn't know math could fire lasers!
1+1=3
Woah second coming has new power
This is like my favorite video ever now
Blu green yellow đâu
Ay we, MI CEREBRO!
My boy second is stuck in a calcumare
E vs Stickman
Orange is so smart btw  and it reminds me Alan beacker = Alan walker i am maybe confused?
WHAT REALLY HAPPENS INSIDE THE CALCULATOR APP
Bro wth just happened.
The end made me  feel like i choose to stay in the infinite void. 🥺
5:35  Nobody: TSC: draw a perfect circle like its nothing :O
my brain be like on math:
This man literally made stickmans fight against numbers...and some how make it AMAZING!!
Dude you know that 1+1 is 11 why 2
POV:taking a maths exam
i just want to point out how incredible the sound design is, super satisfying to listen to throughout the whole video
You should do a video where you actually enter your own computer and become a stick figure for a while
Oreng is smart ter den me
TSC become a math teacher in only 14 minutes
Wonderful way to show the beauty of math
As a teacher of math, im using this for the students, looks so cool
The devide by 0 bit was probably the most unique take on it by far And the concept of value overpowering and canceling the value of the blades causing each to cancel or spend based value  Same with tinkering with pi  Man this episode is amazing even if I don't remember everything
my mind blew up...im in 4th grade ;-;
Bro just gave me all the equations on earth lol
4:40 clippy 2
THIS ANIMATION IS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
Unlock skill
wow i like this can you make more pl😊
I don’t understand anything 😢
Okay that went so unbelievably hard
mathmatiscs
THIS VIDEO IS SO AWESOME!
I don't know now, but I found mathematics to be very beautiful.
1+1=2
wath
You should do "Animation vs History" where yellow accidentally created a time glass that can travel in time. Yellow shows it to the team and they travelled at the beginning, They walked around and saw a cavemen which is Purple and tries to kill them so the team traveled again to the future but they saw purple again as a robot then they travel more into the timelines and always saw purple so when they get back to their timeline they killed purple I guess?
so this is why my teacher taught me math
these are some great ways to visualize some of the equations, even the more simple ones, even just multiplication, division and power, you did great showing how it was done, good job as always
This sound track reminds me of electro from the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movie, I live it
2
Me on the calculator:
super cool amination. What programm do you use?
i lose about half of my brain cells while watching this, why didnt anyone warn me that this is only for smart people😭
so easy to understand lesson
hey what app do you use for the animations
He is smarter then i tough
1+1=?
How is tsc learning college math un like 2 minutes
man, I'm an engineering student and I'm in awe of this animation. The way you've used math here to build the animation is amazing, and all the banter makes perfect mathematical sense. I love you videos, and this is one of my new favorites.
Math is finally intresting now!
Every knows that 2 + 2 = 🐟 I mean you’ve gotta be pretty dum thinking otherwise
Thần đồng toán học:)))
bro...nerds would be gods if this was reality
thanks for one more video that takes away my boredom alan
Nice
can someone make a sound track of this music?
please i need an analysis video about this explaining each and every single thing. this is a literal masterpiece. i wish maths was taught to me like this instead of having to memorize and do just what the teacher does.
POV: you made learning fun through animations.
Alan makes things so alive that he even made Math cool.
Marvel y DC con millones de dólares en presupuesto para cobrar una historia: 🤮🤢  Alan Becker en su casa con un man de palos, GeoGebra y el editor: 😮🕶️👌
Interesting
My guy just solved my homework
Man you need an Oscar for this
This is one of my favorites!
I think I learned more math here than I did in high school 😅😅😅
I want this to be a video game
Grade Alan enseñando matemáticas
POV : You're seeing an animated recreation of what my last two braincells were up to during last week's finals
i like when the e start's screaming😂
Lo unico que aprendi vuendo este video con tastos numeros, letras, y simbolos que no tenia idea de que existian es... Que nunca va a aprender suficiente en esta vida xD
You should do fortnite animation
woah epic
I know it's a small thing but I cannot get over how at 0:27 when he stretches out the 1 again the strands holding it together are also an equals sign. It's a little detail but i really love it.
okay, anyone who's in late high school should take this to their math prof, they'll get a kick out of it and should be able to break it down into why this is epic in more ways than one.  I was a math major back in the day and i still remember all the fun i had monkeying around with Euler's Identity.   @alanbecker, this is insanely clever, well done sir.  I haven't thought about that proof in years.  Although I will say, I did not catch a 3rd dimensional variable for the 10:30 animation. :D
I wish math was that cool
POV: when you're brain fight the math teacher  The math teacher:
I wanna send this to my math teacher
This is amazing!!  I bet you could use this style of animation to teach people how to subnet!
Animation vs math 2
My brain after studying for 20 minutes
this actually helped me understand the math I was learning today :0
math is great I love math and I loved this
pls ep 2
I swear, if he makes a series out of the other sciences-
so cool
5 yo me when said that im going to learn better math
the true avm
My brain on math test
"Darnit fractions are so hard! What did you get for Number 4?" "SHE SAID DON'T SHARE ANSWERS!!!"
This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Wow
TRILHA SONORA FODAAAAAAAAAA
I love aleph overshadowing everything at the end. Long live the successor function!
If math were interesting
This video is very good, deserves part 2
QUE FODA PQP
I’m so confused. But that’s ok. I love math.
Bro turned the most hated subject into the most loved animation on youtube.
I like how you used sound in this animation
Woo! Bravo for Alan and Terkoiz! To have this kind of direction for a MATH animation is nothing to scoff off of. Shouts out to the rest of the animation team too! Yall did great!
What song or music is that??
This Is Very Cool!! Its Very Cool That U Made It So Smooth!! I Was So Happy That U Made An New Video!! Im A BIG Fan! This Was So INSANE!!!!! AWESOME JOB!!!!!!! U Are Very Talented!! This Animation Is So Impressive! Keep Up The Good Work Alan!!! And Never Give Up!!! <3
That went from kindergarden math to university level very quickly
i love the sound design on this one
I need to know about the lore
Is anyone else super confused
I never learned calculus, so a lot of this went over my head
아잇 이과가 꼴받게 하잖아
Literally only alan becker would make the most dramatic fight scene between a hand drawn stickman and math
oh my god.
This probably one of the fun ways to learn math, yet I do not understand it lmao.
a master piece
pensé que sería animación vs math pero no me lo imagine así de genial porque solo le entendí al inicio, pero a la bestia
Ma freaking god THATS TOO.... DIFICULT
Alternate title: if nerds were animators
You Should Do A Sequel,Its So Awesome And Cool!
Wait - what happened to the stick man at the end?
Bro this video I can't
There are so many numbers I can't keep up
The fact that Allen becker’s team actually knows the math shows how much better they are than most animators
Power of e
what does the + end equal?
Wow…
I would go to school if this was how math was taught
you are the only person on earth who could make a battle between e^iπ and a stick figure look epic
PTSD
This better  than my school
The fact Alan can turn literally anything into a combat system is fucking crazy on top of people feeling sympathy for Euler numbers
Yo que odio las matematicas,esto es increible jdjs
I was first to saw this but then I was like no ty I saw this when it  Was not released it was just a glitch and also I saw this in my dreams
I can totally see math teachers playing this video for their students. Great job!
Necesto que Derivando y Mates mike reaccionen a este video
Orange boi has insanely big brain
Bruh I event to a hospital after this episode💀💀💀
Math has lore now?
this feels like a math lesson
I didn't think someone can make math cool yet here is Alan doing just that
ma man got stuck in the calculator 💀
This inspired me...  To continue watching YouTube and not change anything about the current status of my room.
Orange has a quintillion of iq 😂
Think I can pass my upcoming Calc exam now, thanks!
Increíble pero no entendí nada, mis matemáticas solo me dejaron entender hasta el minuto 3:48 😂
i felt excitement while feeling my mind be shredded at the same time.
This describes my hatred for math
You should have done ♾️^♾️ (I called it “True Infinity”)
This is what math is supposed to be. You mess around with numbers and see what happens
So this is what they meant by learn and have fun honestly my brain is destroyed by this math
This actually helped me I learned things on this video. this video is insane it's so smooth,cool,and fun. Great work Alan.
i knew someone would make an epic animation with math after seeing nyan make sans (font) fight animation but damn, this is way beyond anything i could have ever expected
Only AlanBecker and his team could get me to WILLINGLY watch a 14-minute-long video about math.
Animation vs Programation
At this point its not maths anymore💀
The caption team is gonna have a blast with this one! 😂
As an'8 grader, this made  me understand anything about math
The second coming accidentally fell into alans digital calculator.
Can you make the stick figures do a robot battle or give them lightsabers or add kaiju
So, this is the time when you can no longer just say “AvM” for “Animation vs Minecraft”
and this is why you need to know algebra lmfao
I thought it was impossible to make math enjoyable, I was wrong
Alan’s IQ is 20000+
E:(
this Is   Awesome
e
Wait what
11:07 bro summoned a whole deathstar 💀💀
Little did I know, this video has taught me something. Thanks for this, Alan!
Screw you math!
My brain is hurting help
Make it art subject
Math will be my favorite subject if the lessons were taught like this
Did anybody hear the vent sound?
I love how it always comes back around to the unit circle
Blud made math fun
This is awesome, keep up the good work Alan!
5:42 He can't make a 360? 8:34 What number is f?
What our math teachers expected us to do 💀 =
Ok alan Becker but Voltes ALAN BECKER vs Lowercase E
So you're basically telling me that a stickman is smarter than me in math.... Cool, i'm interested
I learned more lessons in mathematics in this video than my whole semester
If only they taught maths like this  I would of done well
Awe man. Integral vs differential right there 😂😂😂😂
this was so weird but intriguing to watch since im in calculus and i can like somehow piece together why certain things are happening because of the laws of math. its so mind boggling
Wow my mind was blownd
Awe man. Integral vs differential right there 😂😂😂😂
Thank you Alan for making all of our days!
"the class test is gonna be easy"  the class test:
good videos i love you man
You are  Genius !
Wow
next video: Animation VS Emojis
o novo aisten laranja jenio
13:50 infinite the alef zero
And all this just to calculate how much Shrek charges for classes on Thursday...
Alan is now the best teacher
Can you make "Animation vs Geometry Dash" pleaze?
Dead star 😂
Your team is mind-bogglingly talented, not only did you make me have emotions for a number, but also, halfway through I realized each summation shot is the equation with the number inserted and the blast IS THE ANSWER TO THE EQUATION. Amazing work you guys!!
This is basically a boss battle 😅
Can the Second Coming apply this knowledge to Minecraft?
HOW THE HELL HUMAN MADE THIS
Si cuphead cult of the lamb star wars y dark souls tuvieran un hijo be like
Orange is becoming smarter than me 😅
Get your before 30 minutes or a/1 hour video old ticket here if it's too late you can also get your before a/1 day or a/1 week or a/1 month or a/1 year video old ticket! Please don't report me cuz of spam I just want to do this for fun!
What si that😱
do a culab with pencilmaton and you
epic
It would've been hilarious if this was sponsored by Brilliant
OMG.. ur math is epic!!
What you think about during math class...
This reminds me alot of portal 2
school: no  stickmen: YES
This just proves math is infinite in ways that are unexpected it’s as simple as an animation
Me when i was a kid with my imagination times in math:
Math Tests be like XD:
POV: When you do the math exam in your dream
א!
This makes me feel like I live in the golden age of youtube
Profe no entendí
Finally
Wow.
my brain hurts
Now i have something to remember the difference between SIN and COS
This is awesome lol
the basics turned to complex equations just like our life from elementary to college
Che cose assurde che creei è stato pazzesco wow
Ainmation vs fanf 1
what is this ??! School ?! Its cool though , the animation , not school
The engineer in me enjoyed this great work
This is awesome!
Aprendiendo mates con el profe Alan y stikman naraja XD
6:02 PACMAN
I feel like this was only the pinnacle of what Maths is and there is more that Orange can learn about
to everyone wondering what the giant graph thing at the end, if you look hard enough you can see its either Aleph or Aleph null(its hard to tell without outlines). since its an N im pretty certain its one of the 2
On a scale of ÷ to ×, how bad does your hand hurt?
I need a game like this.
I've never been entertained by math like this my entire life
This would be the best way learn math or even as like a review would be super fun!
9:29 *INFINITE POWER!!!*
The mats now are funy
This 14 minute video taught me more than half of math class for the school year…💀
Bro is learning more about math than I did in 6th grade, seriously this was sweet keep it up!
my adhd while doing math:
My only question is how did Orange get to the Math equation zone?
This animation proves tsc can manipulate the fabric of a dimension and pass the ability to others or am I exaggerating it😅 And Tsc is acting a lot like an invader like the chosen one
Bro continues to be the most creative human. Also, tell your lead animator that they ballin'. I now require an "animation vs physics" to exist, because this was truly awesome.
My brain broken
i don't know why but i feel smart if i watch this
At the ending, the giant symbol is aleph-null. Aleph-null is the smallest infinity. Yes there is different infinities, some smaller and bigger lol.
honestly all of this is a cool way to think of math
i did not understand anything after that ei thing showed up but wow i enjoyed this alot, and i feel like everyone else here had the same experience.  Q U I T E  T H E  I N T R I G U I N G  M A T H A M A T I C A L  C O N O N D R U M
i expected baldi to show up but didn't see him  sad.
glad to see aleph nol at the end
i always wanted to know what went on inside my calculator... for some reason the numbers randomly started moving around one time.
Never fail to impress
Bro really doing math to open another dimenson 💀
THE LEGEND BACK!? or is it just my FYP page suggesting this?
alien tiene una calculadora xd traduzled
I’d love to tell everyone that this  is why I’m a nerd, but I barely understood the first half of this video (from a math standpoint).
I actually love math
Video definition: Worth the wait
The sound of changing the equation is so good!
Why can't math be this fun at school!
Most fun math lesson... EVER and FOREVER!!!
Exceptional!
TEH TUMBNAIL IS 3
Bro just taught me about cos sans sin and square root pretty fast
9:04 이게... 우주 팽창인가...
Math is so easy if you are old
Y así fue Cómo aprendi matemáticas😂😅
New concept?
+200 iq ahhhhhhhhhhh
수학은 예술이다!
I really hate math but this is just what I needed
e
I Wonder what would of happened if he decided by 0
I like mathhhhhhhhhh
epic
Remember kids if you able to pull of all this you to can create a death beam that it brakes the fabric of a space.  Ok so on this there will be a test also any questions.
make a part 2
This was the funniest math lesson I've ever seen. I loved the giant Aleph at the end as well.
This has gotta be one of the most creative animations ive ever seen and i can explain how or why
Best of all😊
only Alan Becker can turn a math formula into a  sub-orbital laser cannon
When my mother told me that the cartoon was useless and came to watch this clip.😅
zzzzzz
You are the goat
1. This is one of the best animations I have seen you make ever, Especially since there is still logic to it and if this was math class I would go to it every day. 2. WHERE DID TSC GO
If this ain’t how they teach math in 2030 I’m not learning
Good、勉強にもなるのかもしれない
damn i got some iq points from this video fr thanks
wow, the nerd´s dream
tsc is smarter than albert einstien (change my mind)
That was an intense math class! 100/10 would attend again
I would love if more content like this was made on Youtube, especially if ASCII Art could be used to our advantage. Great Video by the way, one of the best that I've seen on the platform so far.
なぜオイラーの等式と戦う必要があったんだ...
IQ100,000,000
TSC tries to be smarter than yellow
math
= The end
We all know 1+1= 11, so why is it 2?
Take advantage of math after the video😅
What this video song name?
Mathness Combat
I can't even understand the math but I like it XD
My brain while watching the video: 😶
Please do animation vs baldi's basics
😅
it would've been so funny if you made a second one where he comes back to this universe and before that he was watching Henry stickman do the 1227 divided by 0 and he does it in this universe not his home one
This is wooow, that's amaziiiiing I'd love to study Math like this, but as many students I'm soo bad at Math and I want to improve my lvl but its hard bcz I don't understand a lot of important lessons, sorry for reading this 😅😅  I enjoy every sec of the video ❤❤❤ .
Never thought math can be this epic
Second coming mastered complex numbers in no time, by the way, how did he end up there?
You nerd you made me love math and now I am doing actually good and bad at math
Простите за мат конешно F🇷🇺ck, little men who are afraid are now solving puzzles
speed
The next shoud be animation vs music. I think it has a lot of potencial.
NANI
Isn't that aleph-zero at the end of the video??? Also, It reminded me of a song called aleph-zero by Optie Animation. Cool stuff Alan
I never thought math could be animated in such a way that it could be used for an intense battle
Nahh he just made a death star 3
Why is Euler's identity so violent and why did it suddenly stop being after orange massacred his clones lol, I feel like after that Euler's identity should've been even more violent
Much more interesting than algebra and geometry lessons
JESUS CRIST THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE SEEN ON YOUTUBE
This animation made math look more fun
Perfect
mats are boring the mats XD
I understand understand anything
This symbolizes how math is the cause of everything bad
this video reminded me the magnitude of math and now i'm having an existencial crisis
Legal
Insane video, insane animations, is this part of the new Animation Vs Animator?
What are math teachers went through:
Wait, how did orange get there and how did he get back?
i loved the music on this one, it really makes the whole experience more inmersive and mysterious. Scott buckley always does such a great job for these soundtracks, it wouldn't be the same without him
Did Alan finally send his child to school?
This was so cool to watch
A Kids Worst Nightmare.
IS THIS AVAILABLE AS A SANDBOX? PLEASE!!!!????
I'm in math olympiad and I didn't even know some if these equations 😂
Oh my gosh... what just happened? That was so cool! Being about to go to scout camp for a week I'm really glad to have gotten to see this before I left. This is so cool! If I didn't already have the badge I'd probably take animation, but I did that 4 years ago and that's what my digital media class in my senior year is for.  This is so cool! Totally deserves a part 2, absolutely loved it! And of course, all the chaos of e was tons of fun to watch. Incredible as always Alan, I can't wait to see what's next!
Imagine e in It's final form fight the dark lord and king orange...
Ah yes the + end they are was just friends that was scared by orange?
*this is what exams feel like*
TCS brain:why meeeeeee
Bro made something so boring so interesting and idk how bro fr😂  Jesus loves you btw and He can help you a bunch in your life just ask Him to Here’s a good verse if you want to accept Jesus into your life and be saved and brought into Heaven because He alone can forgive you of your sins/debts 👍  Romans 10:9 “ If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
I have a huge headache now, but it was definitely worth it.
Eres el más talentoso de todo el pinche mundo mis respetos 😎👍👍😎
Ah...maths wasn't my strong point on school...I would like to be that good, really.
Me gusta la matemática y es el video que he estado esperando todo este tiempo.
My head hurts, I barely passed Algebra in high school
な、なんかすげえ
this feels like one of those scenes where the mc is attempting to make something, but hits a stump do to not knowing the correct formula and as soon as he is about to give up he a new theory just pops up out of nowhere solves the problem that he's having.
アランベーカーは数学もできるとは、、
I swear. Anything that it boring, if Alan Becker makes it, it's super fun.
I have probably learned more. Math than my math teacher in a whole school year
Se me quemo el cerebro
That one nerd in class be like:  But anyway, this was a nice video overall! Thanks for.. uhhhh making this video AlanBecker!
So sad😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bro represented 4th and 5th dimensions on 5 sec
Ппц интересней чем школа
Never thought anyone would make me like math again. Amazing work as always Alan and team!
Very creative Alan Becker , grab something people don't like and use it in a very speacial way!
When you failed math class
Wow
So dont be surprise TSC is the nerd one among the group xD
Tremendo
e^iπ
this is the best animation ive ever seen of math
Orange still have plenty of stuff to learn about
можно подробный разбор что такое синус и косинус как с i
4:43 tsc is like, “IM CHRISTIAN! DONT TEST ME” 😂
Langsung paham gw bjir🤓
Wao this crazy
That was just amazing ❤
11:06 its a cannon event :)
9:45 Okay, imagine if there was a souls-like using math like that
Lmao at the massive aleph at the very end.
so how deep and dark will the lore of this one get.
Bro there is something missiing that orange must be eating the numbers so he would be bigger
I didn't understand any of it but it was cool
I am slowly understanding math
how do you make me excited about math
geilste folge ever
12:43 aw they become freinds 🥹🥹🥹
MAN CRAZY ANIMATION
this is so satisfatory to watch !!!
Dude you are one of the top 10 most talented creators in YouTube for sure. Absolutely love all your work❤
11:34  nothing happens
Your power is infinite? TSC fights with infinity. Can't belive- this dude made math EPIC. It really shows how "powerfull" is math.
huh
This video can teach you math
10:14 maths are too strong but can orange still win the fight?
That was amazing🎉🎉
When orang and the math thing saying goodbye to each other it's making me feel sad🥲
Due to this video, math became so much fun, i turned all my grades to A+ and i caused World War 1+2, i also got a new puppy and named him,  e
Now I can understand math. Thanks Alan!
This is you in your head during math class.  Fighting with equations.   Then you fail anyway.
love you alan, keep it up
1+1=11 😜😜😜
1+1=🐟
Me fighting with math to be able to understand 0.001% of the values shown in school:
8:50 this is a tough one for orange
Do science
idk, maybe some will disagree, but we can already create the Alan Baker syndrome, because in each of his stories at the end the villain joins the Animation, and the King with Purple, and the Animator, and Qubert, now also Math
This man's imagination is as infinitely large as the universe, the multiverse, and the afterlife.Even with mathematics this man can invent a very epic and entertaining short
The crossover we never knew we needed
My head hurts
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
this summerizes everything about math that ive learned in school so far, and more
what does the letter א has to do with everything? (on the end of the video )
I like when they be friends
My simple brain can't even process how good this is. Amazing work as always!
Someone is definitely going use this video for math class to teach
claps to alan. he teached us 14 minutes of advanced math
After spending 6 years in primary school, 2 years in intermediate school, 5 years in high school, and 4 years in university. I actuality learned maths from watching this.
2++2 = bow
i don’t remember this in math class
Nice
i can't understand....
Oh yeah this is Crazy
Cool!!! Alan! This is so funny!!!
9:39 La mejor parte para mí.
5:04 he is so scared from a orange stickman 😂😂😂😂
I have now a new reason to learn math ❤
I got lost on the math about halfway through but this was nevertheless one of the hypest things I’ve seen in a WHILE
Never did I think a letter could show fear
Bro learned every form of math in the matter of 14 minute's 💀💀
E says AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Alan is the only person that can make math fun, entertaining, and satisfying at the same time.
wait a minute. this isn't 3blue1brown. what channel did i click?
What is that symbol of math?
bro helped me pass summer school
This si how school should be, this is insane Alan and the team are really cool
Amazing video, one of the best one in my opinion, the way how Alan integrated math in to action is mind blowing.
3:23 4 to the 5th power
Bro's phuqing animation and can still do math better than me
alan becker took the phrase "the power of math" to another level
DIOSSS QUE ES ESTA LOCULA! alan te pasaste con esta joya👌
absolutely phenomenal!!! ... huh. for once in my life, i actually wish i attended calculus...
after i watch it i want to study math
A war between math and math
I love this
I told all my teachers that math was dangerous
IQ 1000000
I can't stop learning math because I'm grade 3 😂😂😂
1+1=5
how to be good at math:
The Mathway Boss Battle
pov. my mind in math
My brain doesn't know some formulas in this animation , really out ordinary for me 😅
You can get a VS animation. baldy please 🎉😊
Wow, for the first time while watching these videos I got the feeling of 'Ouch, my eyes' 😅 Magnificent work 😁
As a math lover, I found this extremely entertaing to watch
Darn it, i missed it..
Please hear me out but can u pls make this into a game pls there's no doubt in y mind it will be great please
1+1=11
Oooo another series😀
me encanto la animacion y como con simples numeros pudo sacar resultados logicos
lol
Bro using complicated maths to use as a weapon
If only math actually worked like this 😢
Me encantaría tener una materia con la que el más listo gana en combate
Alan and Co just proved that Math is a weapon in the most visually accurate way possible.
That was beautiful.
수학자들이 보는 수학의 세계
Muy bueno el video pero no entendí casi nada al final XD
I never thought I would feel sympathy for Euler's number. Congratulations on this perfection
10:02 It's cute
in the future: Animation vs. Music
"I guess they figured out the power in numbers."  - Corny Phrase 2023
I have no idea what any of this math means.. 😂
Creo que aprendí mas de matemáticas en éste video que en lo que llevó en universidad :V
WE BOUT TO GET OUT OF THE MATH CLASS WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the sound design is crazyy Besides the creativity it's easily one of the best parts about this animation
Nice to see Terkoiz do what he does well.
.. 3098 maths belike:
This was beatiful to watch. Thanks Alan, and thanks to your team.
Me in my math notes be like
1:46  wth is that thing moving
When entiendes todo lo del principio but al final no entiendes nada
🤏🕶🤨
SC: OK LETS MAKE A GUN IN THE WINDOWS CALCUALTOR!       Love this stuff
Where’s the others
Apuesto que una persona que conozco vio este video lol
wow math is interesting hehe hee and the rest stickman
YO THIS IS SICK between the animation and the sounds and the math (half of which i dont understand), this is a sick animation! as of writing, im 10 minutes into the video, but if it leaves me on a cliffhanger or something, you should make a part 2 or a series (like minecraft)
4:63 that part of the music has a little spider man 2099 theme vibe. And Alan mentioned that he watched Spider-Man across the spider verse
❤❤🎉
in the old days he had good animinations and he still uploads better animinations
You need to make another math one but he discovers divided by 0 your the best bty.
fastest way to learn math:
E and the rest of their friends lived happily ever after inside the Desmos graphing calculator.
As someone who's been into math since I was 12, this is the best visualization on equations, expressions, symmetry and the true meaning of math as a whole I've ever come accross. This is not just entertainment, this is pure genius. It's brilliant. By the way, I loved how the so called "most beautiful equation" (aka Euler's identity) shows up and basically tries to trick the stickman. That's quite deep. If you know what that equation means, it makes total sense. Also, I loved when they got into the imaginary domain for a brief moment and everything seemed broken, then they came back to the real numbers domain at a different position in space, which also makes perfect sense if you know a bit about operations using imaginary numbers. Every single frame of this video makes perfect sense, really. Not to mention the overal details such as the animation, the plot, the way things build up with math concepts and ideas showing up in a logical order, soundtrack, sound effects... 3blue1brown would be proud. Again, genius.
Holy crap, Alan are you guys on steroids? That’s 3 uploads in about 2 months!
Next lesson science
Stunning!
SC is a faster learner than all of us
I like to think that the time of the video is actually how much time orange spent in this dimension, so he just created an orbital laser out of math in just 11 minutes of being there
The best *ASMR award goes to this person🎉🎉
Any math wiz out there explain the best you can what glory I just watched 🎉
this is the best video ive ever seen
7:10 Waiting for him to find e
Nice animation
Calculated.
This takes knowledge is power to another level. Literally
My past trauma of trigonometry…
: )
God if only I could fully learn and understand every mathematic concept in the span of 12 minutes like the stick figure just did. Not fair at all
WE MADE SUMMER BREAK FOR A REASON!
Or it could be called reading
e
This is literally what I imagine in my head during math when it’s boring
Next video I bet is letters and the letters make something or something happen
I DONT WANT TO GO BACK TO MATH I JUST FINISHED SCHOOL
Tysm Orange for  teaching me now I know everything  1+1 1-1 1×1 1÷1 1¹ 1/1½⅓¼⅕⅙1/7 e I . Con Sin f Pie
I thought this was fanmade until I looked at the channel..
no way
Краткий намёк школьникам, мол всё, вам хана
This is awesome. Might not have understood it all, but this is the most I've ever enjoyed math
My man dropped the best animation on math
my fav one off
Thankyou alan for the ÷ now i now how to ÷
That was incredibly clever. Even those formulas all looked legit to me. You must've had a math major involved.  Such a fine job.
This got #4 in trending yayyyy!🎉
I think I would need a doctorate in mathematics to even begin to understand this video, but it still manages to be fun.
Please tell me TSC will be able to do all of this outside of this video. Green can sing, and TSC can do math. I think it would be cool if they all developed special skills like this.
Better get my teacher to Put this as a math lesson 💀💀💀
This video is really amazing! Could someone make the narrative of what is happening second by second in the video? Likewise, I even think that someone could even write a whole book explaining this narrative, this would be the best way to learn mathematics in depth! I eagerly hope someone capable will take this comment seriously. Greetings!!
Love math
Money time percentage what else is missing here?
Holy shit I fucking loved this animation so much that now I want to curse Maths
Criatividade é seu nome. Muito top!
orange literally made a death star
انا ماتواقعت هاذا شي
살다살다 수학 공식이 사람 패는 애니도 보네
You've seen the animation lore... Now get ready for the math lore
살다살다 수학 공식이 사람 패는 애니도 보네
Bruh man made Math cool
10:33 its a fng death star
este video es una obra de arte sencillamente es lo que es
That was...    ... interesting
Please make this a series and teach me math
THORN AND KEY ARE REAL
Sorry I meant dream nit mind lol
Me when I see this video 🤯🧐💀☠️
Me when im bored and screwing with the calculator on my phone
this is too smart for me
Wow! Amazing work! It has a 3Blue1Brown vibe to it. I'm positive they would enjoy this video just like I did!
math was never so amazing until now....i was the only one who almost didn't understand most of the video haha
This why i hate math
And I wonder is this a mind or a calculator😂
this guy became this universe's ultron.
Mi pregunta es que como fue que secongcoming terminó ahí
this is what i go through in every maths exam
La verdad yo esperaba la siguiente parte de animation vs animator
👍
this is only way to hate math
we need to bow down to Orange (i forgot his actual name) he drew a PERFECT CIRCLE!
All the math checks out
Or percentage
Man alan just literally make math looking awesome in this video
My brain hurts
This is the most complex yet amazing and chilling math animation ever made. Scott Buckley music too is perfect as well
Man just did an essay and ended up making an animation.
Now one of chemistry
Lets goooo it’s hereee
생각보다 수학적이군요 아주 잘 만들었습니다
Oh, math animation is epic!
This is such an awesome video
They could also put in money or even time.
the math power scaling is insane
I watched this in a summer day and its still awesone
e
Ummm 2+2 is 5 duh 😒
13:19 bro went to heaven
this was beutiful
Wow. I loved this. Especially considering i could keep up somewhat. Until it became overkill, then i stopped trying to analyze the math.
This was actually heart warming
I love the Alif Nol at the end
This so amazing best video
Teacher: the homework isn't that hard The homework:
I have my exam in monday and the subject is math
This animation was so pleasing that when i felt i was going to vomit i watched this and feel like it already happened( makes no sense but im saying your animation/ art work/ drawings/ creativity/ love isn't even enough for this universe to see the creations and creativity you come for us.
Dawg I finished freshman year in honors algebra, I don’t get have of those symbols
The first time you have a chance of mental maths
alan becker strikes again by making math awesome
This is how you get my attention in math class.
bro taught math better than my elementary teacher
Part 2?
13:12 una pregunta sobre este momento caso el portal se lo llevo para casa o mato la naranja porque apareció un número que era menos 1 quién menos uno significa nada Entonces lo mató o se volvió para su casa
This is better than school
Bro that's easy maths
Ah Yes, Alan Becker. My Childhood Animator
Bro ima be in 8th grade soon and seeing this I hate math because I only knew a little of the beginning
I didn't understand a single bit of math in this video.
The e movement was so goofy
This is the most simple and ez way yot get the main idea of math,Make sure every under 4 years child see it,U did (((((((((((((GREAT)))))))))))))
Now THIS is AvM
This animation is absolutely ridiculous and I love it
they be mathing
thanks to this video I no longer have to go to math class
Some of your best work yet. Amazing job you two!
One of the best animations from you 👍
How did you manage to make math cool
“So who taught you math?”   Us: “A stickman”
Que? No acabo de entender nada, pero igual te quedo de maravilla
This is why I'm not an engineering major anymore
He’s playing math odyssey
lets hope there isn't a younger audience watching... their minds would be melted
Is this gonna be on the test?
4:42 the power of christ compels you  12:22 I feel so stupid for not getting this part the first few times
This video is epic but i need the part two of the video animation vs aniamator VI
When I saw this in my home feed, I was like "I ain't gonna be like this, I'm in summer vacation," then I decided to watch this and now I'm just stunned. I never knew something like this could be done for another addition into the "Animator/Animation vs. (subject) series," like I expected Pac-Man to be one of them al the way back in like 2015 if I can trace my old comment, but I was stunned that was made and somehow I predicted it. But in general about this one though, I never knew a story could be so well produced and animated through a pure black void with the only thing being just the 1 at the start, then Orange/The Second Coming taps it and it creates the 1=1 equation, then everything unfolds from there until it becomes practically a sci-fi-like war scenario. This animation was REALLY well done, and call me crazy for saying this, this might by one of my favorites next to AVA V. Alan, you have made incredible work ever since I started watching you back in 2014 when AVA IV was recent, and I still commend your work to this day as you've inspired me to try and make art in general as I started making little parody stick figure comics based off what you've made, and now today I'm continuing to write a script for a video game I'm going to make with various characters, settings, and plot, all thanks to how you made the plot points of your animations.  Great work Alan, keep it up.
Absolutely brilliant
This makes math look fun, awesome video!
Imagine people saying math is useless. Who is laughing now 😂
Subarashi
The way of math is beautiful I want to understand it all (except pie, pie is evil for me)
That moment when you have no clue what any thing means
As a math major, I loved every minute of this. Great story, with real mathematical ideas incorporated (defining Natural Numbers, using those to define Integers and so on) it got to all the right parts of my brain.
The function he ends up making at 8:32 is 9tan(pi*x), right? I assume thats what it is, since that function is equal to 0 at -1 (which is to say, at e^i*pi)
I will show this to my math teacher
This was insanely unique, your creativity is unmatched
This is me when I am bored and I have a calculator next to me
help me...
oMG noltagia
"Have you been doing meth instead of math?"  In all seriousness this is cool and kinda epic but my brain it's not able to  comprehend any of this, I'm more of a language person.
Trig class looks so fun! I can’t wait for Junior Year!
Honestly amazing job Alan, your team is unbelievably talented.  I would LOVE if you made a music version of this though! 👏👏👏
wow just WOW!
I LEARNED MATH YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can someone check if all the math is correct
if sc was my teacher, id never wanna miss class/school ever again
Omg Alan just explained the math lore
Terkoiz, idk how to contact you but dude you did great. This shit reached Tao and a bunch of other experts. I'm surprised 3b1b or alex or  some other well known math expositor wasn't behind this. Beautiful to see. I always told myself making a animated story of math wouldn't be possible but this came rlly close. In the end it was a using mathematical notation as the bricks to tell a story but it was still incredible. There are so many other fields and topics I feel would be a great idea, things like non euclidean geometry, graph theory, p adic numbers and in general visual proofs especially of infinite series are a given but even beyond that risking slightly more mathematical detail and sort of explaining concepts in some written or verbal way you could go on about Ramsey theory, topology, group theoretic flavors of various problems and more. Honestly this is amazing. I feel it could go even beyond, with a video focused on solving a problem, and probably arriving at a visual proof. It could instead also be jumping around from related topics so sum of reciprocals of powers of a number to reciprocals of square numbers leading to pi and irrationality or zeta function which as a few very interesting visualizations and can come to a surprise to many how easily or smoothly at least you can arrive at a problem that stumped so everyone thus far. Adding physics and some sort of story could make it easier, so developing the math needed to calculate orbits or going further with Fourier transforms. Stories such as one of mathematicians known for doing tedious and long calculations could help explore a topic starting from basic arithmetic, like gauss and prime, euler and ramanujan with partition function As I've said this video was fantastic. Thanks
My braaain 🧠
This was amazing.  In fact, I think I understood a little bit more about math than what school could ever teach me. (Kinda joking, but also kinda not.)  We need more of this lol
Holy shit. As a math teacher, the mathematical accuracy is _on point_ !
mi mama me dise que bea algo educatibo lo que boy aber :
SOUND EFFECTS BE FIRE THOUGH
Wish teachers could make math this interesting.
Now Mathcraft
Eu não entendi nada mas isso foi incrivel🎉
How the heck did he get there in the first place and also  Math class be like:
Presenting, the new Yellow stickman 😂
Wow he’s smart now
porfavor que alguien haga una pelicula con esto
Bros Playing Merge Math💀
Incredible! I cant believe how this video concept made sense, but it was also an emotional roller coaster. Good job! 👏
I learned more watching this than i do in school
Need to watch 2x to look at all the stuff that has happend
Oh No math!!!!!
It starts with one...
i felt like i was watching a sci fi documentary the whole time and that absolutely delights me
This would be an epic video game
From how much I don't like math. I like this animation!
2:06 me when i see those things on the door
this is what math class should be like
9:29 bro got the math pack-a-punch
bro fr went through all of elementary middle and high schools within 14 minutes dang 💀
I’m in 7th grade and I know none of this
WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN HELP
I hope that when I look back at this, I understand everything in the video.
WHAT IS THE ANSWER
This man can make a perfect circle, I can only imagine on how others can't do that
I didn't even know wath math is so cool to many numbers i dont understand some of the math XD
I am the milk man, my milk is delicious. Special delivery today! GRAAAAAH!        (yes, I did know all of it, except theta, since what do you expect from a 12 year old)
This video literally made a summary for basic maths until additional maths
imaginary^(2) = e^(imaginary x pi) = (-1) = cos(pi) + (i)sin(pi).
all I have to say is that if Yellow was there, he would 100% know what he would do XD
What just happened  ???
its crazy fact that eⁱpi can do anything. Even form an battle formula and multiplying.
The worst part is that I understood everything until he went beyond calculating x and y for angles and frequency of repetition, you brought back so many memories of how much I hate math and never want to have it again as a subject.
Во первых это афигеть насколько крутая анимация динамика+музыка и сама анимация выросли в разы если сравнить с видео ну хотя бы 1.5 года назад  А во вторых ты нашел комментарий на русском языке
Where did Orange go?
10:02 e: wiiiiiiiiiii   orange: wtf
Math
Yayayayaayayay you are stil uplodeimg
these last few months of me studying calculus have finally paid off
gotta love how TSC is doing 1+1 and then 2 minutes later has mastered trigonometry
Like when the retired math teacher learns animation
hocanın kolay dediği soru
Dude, please create a game. PLEASE!
This is better to learn than those in the math class
CRAZY WORK!
😮 hang on I'm a little confused Is this part of any other series or is it the beginning of the series What is that portal he made take him I just can't quite understand
For those Gumball fans, now that's what I call "Playing Cal-cul-atore"
I hardly see these videos, they were ones from my childhood
No entendí la mayor parte del video😃👍
We don’t need school We needed this
Best math class I never attended
learning 9000 i can skip college now
lol
Epic
10:02 WAAAAAAH
Add a comment...
things that i didn't expect going into today: getting jumpscared by euler's formula
Math be like
Bruh the first few seconds of music reminded me of the voltz series man
Who else love this video but didn't understand any of the calculations
bro made math intresting
Trees have roots, plants have roots, and squares have roots too.
Animation vs Minecraft legends do it now
VICTIM EXPERIENCE THE SECOND COMING
10:26 bro made a death star😂
Cool
O MY LORDS THATS AWSOME
These animations make me feel good about learning this stuff in school and my free time.
Very good
I can’t believe e^(i π) is so hostile. He really is a negative one.
By this I know orange will be very good at math so like green likes music and orange likes math
I need more of this.  I want to see variables and topology with this.
「奴は四天王のなかでも最弱」ってコト！！！？？？

Math lore
∞ - 1 = *World Implodes*
Yo do bloopers, bloopers for this vid would be stuff like base 12 where 9+10 is 21
I learned more math in this video than school 😂 xd
Me you fan ALL videos
Holy crud! Thanks!
I can imagine "mathematics with Juan" making a video called "correcting alan becker" xd
Teachers might love this, they should play this video for their students.
Calculator be like: "and just when I thought life was easy". RIP
this is the math I need to learn
Love how most of that I learned in Pre-Calc
Fr
YOOOOOOOOOOO MAN
9:13 this part looks like some life-ending ride in a themepark
Vote 2 part 👇
the big shadowy one in the end is the first letter in the Hebrew language א. its the fancy version.
This would Fr be my favorite subject if math was like this
Plot twist: TSC was just exploring Alan's computer and he found a Calculator app!
When math becomes fun 😂
Bro teaches me math better than my math teachers.
Brain 🧠 H u r t
Bro made the math movie💀
Man I just died there
Make Part 2 Where The ei meets the second coming in his own dimension.
We’re not just telling stories, we’re teaching maths.
SO FUCKING GOOD
When the animation vs animator part VI ep 2 ??
Two things. One, orange seriously made a mathematical orbital doom cannon and I love it. Two, Aleph Null is depicted as a cosmological entity, which it is. It is all infinite series of infinity.
15 Years Of Math In ONE EPIC VIDEO How Is This Not The Most Fun Math Can Offer..?
Best way to learn math ever but why was there a huge "א" letter at the end?
MATH!
Bruh he somehow made math actually fun
This is so awesome (I did math studies) please do more stuff like this! There is so much that can be done: algebra structures, matrixes, topologies, fractals,...
We’re going to need a part 2 now
keep in mind that all of this happened because of the number 1 descending from the heavens
My mind is Blowing right now... literally.
He is that smart he is the second one
my 12 years of math life in school in 14 mins of this video
Asi sin dan ganar de estudiar matematicas😂😂
as the dumby i am i had no clue what any of this ment
웅장하다
Why cant math be like this
I don't like math but ok i will wath it
HI! HELLO MATH TEACHER WHO'S USING THIS VIDEO AS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT! HOW IS CLASS?
Am I the only one that doesn't understand half of this?
well I just found out you can use math to make a Death Star
nice boring animation
Damn this made math look really fricken cool
:O
SO ANIMATION VS MATH 2!!!!
very good
I BARELY KNOW HOW TO USE ADDITION LET ALONE ALL THIS
Now I know my 123, next time you should watch again
Brooo alan becker and his team just made math cool
i actually learnt math in this video
The Orange is Albert Ainstien!!
AMAZING
This is how autism with math is
Math teachers got stroke after watching this😂
I don't know if it's even possible to do better than this in such a domain... You've made mathematics be alive. This is a REAL MASTERPIECE, man. I'm sure I would've loved mathematics if I had seen this video when still a child. Thank you very much! Wish you success and happiness ∞ times.
Alan becker and his team managed to make math cool.
now imagine a calculator like this
I love this so much. The sound design, the action sequences, and the fact that the math makes sense. I especially love all the small details like why the f(•) cannon works on the clones. It's so perfect. Thank you Alan and team. Thank you all so much 🔥
BANGER!
Very cool! I don't know what half of it means, but I really enjoyed it! Keep up the great work!
The giant aleph was a great touch :) This is amazing work and illustrates maths so well!
THIS WAS JUST EPIC
animation VS Javascript next lmfao
My brain is like 💀
This is honestly one of the most creative fights I’ve seen, and I even watched a guy with zippers kill someone with a fishing rod on a train 😂
Nunca entenderé la matemáticas, pero me gusto el video. 😊
Leave it to Alan to turn maths into an epic battle
La maestra: como es que te volviste tan bueno en matematicas si ayer no sabias ni sumar  Yo: pues...
0で割ってはいけないこと、虚数は現実とは違う裏の世界であること、radの定義などの表現が上手い。 πをcosとsinのトンカチに割ってsin波、cos波を作り出す表現が個人的に好き  唯一知らなかった数学は f(•) と f(∞) だった。あれは何かの関数なのか、自分の知らない他のものを意味しているのか分からなかった。
the animators be like “Put that orange in a situation”
I've just watched 14 minutes of pure magic :/
I still have a lot to learn...
Make a part 2 where all the stickman get in there and try out new members and stuff and at the end those math buddy’s wil come to your pc to see a different world and make that a part 3 where they explore the pc and stick world
the animation and math is aboslutely amazing. probably my favorite video on youtube now. i love aleph nol just walking in the end
holy. this was jsut perfect. the music was so good aswell, this whole was was fascinating.
Animation VS the reason Alan didn’t start a year earlier
I understood exactly half of this
Not sure where Sum_{n=0}^{inf} (i*pi)^n/n! comes from, should be related to Sum_{n=0}^{inf} (-1)^n/n! = e though. I don't recognize the sphere thing either. I do recognize all of this though (despite not being in college yet...)
The + end = ???
How were you able to make a whole animation with math.
Dude actually made *math* interesting.
This animation is the better animation from every animation i ever see ! This animation is very beautiful
The Chosen One litrally became the Death Star to destroy Euler’s Number 💀💀💀   This is epic. Amazing work!!
Bro think his in star wars 😂
I understood up to 7 minutes, but I need more years for the rest how about you?
It would be better if all schools showed this video and told him all the mathematics. This brilliant video will make many fall in love with math
9:29 INFINITY GUN
Hi
The massive letter at the end is א (Aleph) from the number after our number system אn (Aleph-Nole)
I felt sympathy for numbers. Alan’s talent is beyond our comprehension 👏
I gave up understanding the math behind it after ~5 minutes, university math lessons were a long time ago and I don't remember shit 😅 but nevertheless, it was awesome fun to watch!
The second coming is surprised "0" has a hole in it, not like his own head doesn't have a gaping hole either
This is the next generations school
In what moment the animation was addition and subtraction and then a stickman fighting with e?
Did you just made math interesting
Altas ganas de verlos pelear junto con los de el canon
woooow amazing work bro
bro really hate ***********e*************
This video is most beatiful thing i have seen last times. I am a math student and I love this so much. Please Alan,you have a great talent and you should make video like this so much. I want see animation vs math 2, phys,che and more. I love you so much.
gg
Now this is something i wanna learn math with
if this was calculous everyone would love it
It's always a good day when Alan Becker uploads
WHY MATH LIKE THIS
Alan, if you can you should do another animation vs. math video. That was absolutely mind blowing and made many of the concepts that I learned in school make absolute sense. Thanks for the video and keep doing what you do with these videos.
Hi
this is the most satisfying and interesting display of math I have ever seen.
He taught me better than my maths teacher 😂 Only he can make maths so much of enjoyable And that dark side of the maths
Incrível seus vídeos 👏👏👏👏
Holy crap! We need more of this! It's incredible! I'm not even a math person but I absolutely love this :D
When your math teacher says you'll need this in real life:
If only math teachers showed us this video to explain everything in it, that would be so much fun
bro its soooo easy math 1+1 is sooooooooooo easy  1+1= 3

Me hizo recordar que cuando era niño me imaginaba que los números tenian vida y peleaban entre si usando matemáticas basica como la suma y la resta porque apenas tenia 6 años  Ahora lo que quiero es aprender matemáticas avanzadas
Wow they should show kids in school this, so they learn to fight and math
This gives me the feeling of a universe appearing from nothing
this is sick!! the math nerd in me is so happy
The best part about this is that it's accurate to real life
QWERTY ÙwÚ Wow 😮😳🥺😁👍👏✨✨
I wish this game exist🥲
So this is what happens inside a calculator
This needs to be a series! It's amazing!
Hmmmmm Math good for brain
Across the Spiderverse has nothing on this guy.
Only Genius people can solve the math problems.
The sound design in this video is out of this world
The sounds are satisfying😊
I feel like I'm watching baby sensory videos but in a good way
Dude’s in the matrix but instead of the Earth it’s a CAS
Math = strong
man tch us all math itsalf with battle
I bet you have to do a lot of math to do this
my brain hurts
damnnn
The amount of creativity is mind boggling! How do you guys manage to make such entertaining scenarios and epic fight scenes using just _math concepts???_
NOW this is how you do a video premiere!
INSANE!!!!
This was mathematically beautiful ❤
... Can we have more where orange teaches the rest about math?
you some how managed to make math interesting
OMG my brain literally exploded by how awesome and how many numbers in this video I suddenly feel smarter Keep making more awesome content and I bet someday you’ll be the biggest animation youtuber ever 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤😊😊😊
thank you for teaching me 1 + 1 is ''? orange stickman''
this made me understand math
Wow Im so sleepy when i wach math Animation, and then i just wake up now with my phone screen still on the Vidio.  and that night sleepy I had a cool dream ✨
This is blew me away, it's drugs for a math and art lover. Surprised by the quality. Saw Tao talk about and was surprised to see it was you. Just beautiful stuff. Rlly felt like playing around with math
saca el capitulo 32
How does he break me with how good his videos are but now his team broke me with math
I don't know but this so cool!
i think ima make a game out of this
7:16 when you are messing around with the games mechanics and accidentally start a boss fight
This is true art fr❤
Why does it feel like Orange has a smaller head?
Have no idea what's going on, and i'm fine with that.
Hola Alan becker   si sabes español  quiero desirte que tus videos son geniales   y que me encantan muchos
What if math was entertaining this will be the perfect scenario
This is literally better than most shows out there imo
Hi i am 10 years old and i love your video that was so helpful for my math thank you!
alan just never disappoints
And this video is a perfect way of tricking Kids into wanting to learn math, and to EVERYONE if you think Math's boring just watch this video.
0 /|\ / \
nice
Sorry I missed the premier, but I was at work and wouldn't have been able to enjoy it.
beautiful
This is insane Alan are the best maker of animatons
THE POWER OF LEARNING COMPELS YOU
As a math fan, i confirm this is 100% real
IS incredibile, omg
this episode was very EPIC AT THE START AND END LOL
Alright so I’ve seen Animation vs Math but now I need to see Animator vs Math. Does Alan’s math knowledge hold up against the test of time?
Alan, teacher
I will be learning all that shit next school year 😭
This video proves that mathematicians can be very creative, This also shows Alans great talent in editing❤❤
I've never had so much fun watching math as I did with this video 😂
1+1=11 hahaha
No entendi nada pero estubo bien chingon el video :D
Wow, I hate math but this was PHENOMENAL
Alan Becker is the only man on earth who can make sick and epic animation with mathematics. Just wanna that The Chosen One adapt really fast.
The stickmans are getting smart👍
I learned more from this then in school
O MELHOR EPISÓDIO DE TODOS, FAÇA MAIS DESSE ESTILO POR FAVOR
2+2=5
He just nade math more fun
Thumbnail answer: 1+1=2
i just watched a video about a stick figure doing math and fighting with numbers, yep
The sound effects though😂
This video was more informative than my entire time at elementary school
Joder, eso sí es cine
🥶
No entendí nada xD
I wonder if someone had made Alan's creations into an anime, because I think this should definitely be in one. If you don't think so you have horrible taste.
this will help me throughout highs chool.
You somehow made ptsd enjoyable
Que briza mn kakakakakak
Ptsd
why does this look so fun?
Making an animation with only numbers and stick figures is too amazing😊
bro, my brain made windows blue screen the moment the -1 appeared 💀
too cool for school
Ima say this... But second coming is good at math 😮... Not bad for his first time😃
Pov: When you are in math lesson
You have no idea how satisfying this was to watch at work! Thanks for making such an impressive mathematical video, Alan! Glad to see Orange hopefully went back to their world.
As I did for Wanted I will say some soundtrack names for fun so let's get started:  0:01 : Waking problems  1:39 : Something sentient  2:13 : Advanced plan  3:50 : Needed results   4:09 : Clash of equations  5:12 : Unexpected discovery  6:49 : Perfect toughts   7:20 : *Equals* mayhem  9:28 :  Infinite disaster  11:06 : Mathematic breakdown  13:05 : Verified way-out  13:33 : Family completed  And that all I think,some were the same soundtrack but giving it (1+1) different names was fun,so that everything.
Я не понимаю математики, но выглядит это очень эпично.  После этого видео поднялась мотивация продолжать интересоваться математикой.
Who knew you Math could get so action packed.
A love letter to math and animation. Awesome video
1:42  You lost me there.
absolutely astonishing. The visuals, the sounds, the concept...  That's absolutelly wonderfull. Math is epic isn't it ?  Going straight to the director's commentary now, I got lost pretty quick.. But I definitivelly wouldn't mind seeing this become a serie as well !  Thank you for your hard work team !
You can’t just leave me like that
Damn... this was crazy ❤
bro made the death star with numbers
This animation taught me more things than almost every single math teacher I've met on my entire life
i lack math 😞
Doctor: Your son die by Math Mother: 🗿
I loved this, I had just finished pre-calculus so I actually understood most of it
8:30 it went from awesome fighting scenes into cod zombies then into star wars or something like that
Dark Souls is the math of the gaming world
Whats 1+1 again
After just finishing calc bc, gotta say love this video, and I’m proud of myself for being able to follow a lot of the different equations going on. Awesome work as always Alan and crew, never cease to amaze with how you can make an epic fight scene and visual thriller of a story with such simple things as stick figures and math equations.
thank you for giving a proper explanation on how school feels
Me. Watching first 90 seconds. (Spoilers for these 90s.)    Yeah, adding, subtracting, expand the world of integers to negative numbers. Probably dividing next and fractio.... NO! Euler's identity and complex plane! I'm freaking out what's next.
You make me want to learn more math so I can understand this video on another level
Amazing work
Thank God i understand this video, my knowledge in math is finally paying off.
Who knew that math could be this fun.
0÷0 💀
Can anyone explain the maths behind 8:29?
10:03 "AHH! >:( " xD
i like this!
4:11 bro really said get real 💀.
Hey guys! What time in the video did you lose concentration and stopped understanding the math and stuff so you just kept watching because of the good animation?
The math class the day you didn't show up:
This is actually insane..
Ahh yes just like Vietnam
Hello alan Manda saludos Saúl tu succrito
Stickman learning how to use desmos
I love the way he visualized each concept. This is up there as one of my favorite videos of his.
Teacher: 'Hey this is no place to swordplay.' S.C: 'I'm training my brain.' Alan: 'My animation is #16 for *gaming'*
I understood almost none of this!  But good job!
Adorei é a quarta vez que eu parabéns está muito
Tbh i've never been so happy on understanding complex numbers
Pov: The second Coming turned the calculator horizontally
me afther watching this video :👁👄👁💧😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
This video was amazing because it showed me my life digitally
Why thr guy at the end look like a rotisserie chicken
All respects to Alen Becker he somehow made math equations into weapons
No entendí nada excepto los putasos
How did you make math interesting?
W+O+W=WOW
Pov ur too stupid to understand
this feels like school all over
I don't understand, but it's funny for some reason
My brain during the video  ↖️↩️↙️⤴️↙️⤴️⬅️↘️⬇️➡️⬅️↔️🔃
BRO NOW CHESS 🗣️🔥🔥🔥
There are so many things in math now. but then is was “whats 1 + 1?” “hrrrmmmmmmmm i thinks it’s 2” “good boy.”
now orange is god of math 😂😂
Hi
I love how TSC is using more and more complicated maths as time goes on. This guy somehow made maths interesting
POV: math suddenly got a lot more intresting
Leave it to Alan Becker to turn math into a dark souls boss then have the boss be defeated by a giant fuck you laser.
Can someone make a game out of this
내가 살면서 본 영상중 가장 뛰어난 영상
Wow...
That's pretty nice !
Tsc is so smart now
этот чел с буквой e сигмой стал
10:37 Death Star moment
dont make him move at the speed of sound, got places to go now
I love how every time he discovers e^iπ, he knows more and has more interest in it  Edit: First, he learns about exponents. After that, he discovers i and the complex numbers Then he gets into the level of π.
I imagine that this is what every engineer dreams about…
Bro made math fun 😱 9:23
we need a 3Blue1Brown reaction/explanation for this
Man is creating a DNA 7:03
I love so much this animations, Alan is the best 😫🫶🏻
알렌바커는 천재인게 분명하다....
if this was how math was i would get an A+ ere time!
Алан Беккер выпусти 2 серию Анимация против Аниматора пажалуйста
Me trying doing math to know when alan will upload a new video
this is how math can ruin and build my life
Bro never skipped math lesson for making this video
If only this is what math is actually like
Единственная причина учить математику
Imagine being a number past the millions and you accidentally bump into a division sign
This...this is a Masterpiece
God you got me think of math and how it works when I don’t have school TwT
Aprendamos con profe naranja
That's the stuff
Wow I thought this would never happen but now it’s happening!!!!!!
I've only gotten through pre-calc and this hurt my brain. Amazing animation tho
My new favorite animation from the internet
This is one of the sickest video ever
Ngl I wish we had a Vr math program that did this… would make math WAY more interesting
I loved math after this 💀💀
Que pro
Man just created a portal to a different dimension 5:33
orange was becoming like yellow lmao
College.
It’s something special that this video gets me excitedly pointing at the screen whenever a math concept I recognize appears as if I’m watching an Avengers movie and my favorite character got a cameo.
pov youre sick
man this new calculator update goes hard!
Wicked cool
I'm losing brain cells on the animation of the different equations and they're probably correct!
Wow
it was all simple until they added a letter
❤
Morpheus in the future: We don't know exactly what happened. Exactly what happened:
he made it guys *he made math look cool*
:(
I'm certain this is one of few times everyone can agree this kind of math is cool.
❌❌❌❌❌🆘
A Math Teachers Worst Fear          Making Math Actually Fun
I would just like to say this is amazing. This does a great job at showing how things interact with each other, and would be an amazing tool for schools to give kids an interesting lesson that would help make math a lot more exciting and grab their attention. Also more symbols at the end? Possible sequel with the perfectionist Green or technically savvy Yellow?
Fuck euler, all of my friends hate Euler.
Alan made math more interesting than 12 years of math classes in school
bravo c'était incroyable j'en ai des frissons.
The sounds are so satisfying
La pregunta es de cual fumas?
The thumbnail is wrong, 1+1=X
so coooooooooooool 🙃
I think this question came up in my exam
xd
Версия для гуманитариев будет?
Que? 😅
This. This is what YouTube is for. This is AMAZING.
SC learning math faster than I can comprehend what he's doing
Los matemáticos van a alusinar con este vídeo... impresionante! Aunque algo que no entiendo es por qué la "Fórmula de Euler" huye de "The second coming" aunque el que reacciona es el "Número de Euler" y no su exponente de "Número imaginario" por Pi... qué contexto tendrá en esto?
Bro we are getting into some advanced math! Its too much for me and im a 7th grader so if your under that its understandable if this is too much for you. Most people prdont like this episode cus they went from fighting basically gods to doing math but i like this little short of just orange gooding around with math.
I love math so I was ear to ear smiling the entire time!
I never enjoyed Math's this much in my entire life..😂
i think i almost cried, this is actually like i have no words to describe this other than the absolute most beautiful thing i've ever seen
Where did The Second Coming(Orange) go after the fight?
Nah if this is high school/college then I’m gonna fail
He taught me more than my math teacher lol
this is what happens when orange enters the calculator app on alans pc
no entiendo nada
*Applause* That was...so epic and beautiful. What a story!
The greatest and most dangerous enemy of all times ... MATH !!!
Thank you Calculus for making me recognize the Math references shown throughout this animation.
For those wondering what is the big א at the end it has been said that "א אוהל ב זה בית ג זה גמל גדול"
TSC can't sing but knows university math
The guy turned math into an animation, GENIUS
Me whenever I play with and try to break desmos
OMG 0_0!!!!!
Moral: Dont fuck with the basic elements of nature i guess.
Bro made math fun 💀and it’s amazing
This animation identifies how I feel when I struggle with math, it would literally be like this hahaha
Hm. At the end when second goes in the portal.. does he go back in the cage? Will there be another episode?
amazing i will wait for part 2
Orange advanced in maths faster than anyone couls
damn they really be making action packed stories about math
bro you have a talent for animation
Quarter of the way through and the math was already too advanced for me. 🤣
The e always has that smile
Holy hell- I think this is the only time that I’ve enjoyed watching math happen. Bro Alan is like probably one of the most creative people on the planet, he turned math into an anime fight scene, this man is insane. Get him an Oscar! And now he’s got to be like a math genius, bro could teach a college course on animation and math
Ima send this to my maths teacher
Naranja paso de matemática basica a entender el significado del infinito
THIS BLOWED MY MIND!!
I want to be a math teacher so i cam show this to my students
Missed oportunity to call this like: Animation vs calculator
This man *casually* animates both a 4th and 5th dimensional hypercube. He also plays with Euler's equation and uses the imaginary unit to say "hehe can't see me". As an armchair mathematician, I'd love to release a version of this video with all of the mathematical concepts named as they appear.
that massive aleph at the end is wonderful
Imagine have Math Power like TSC used. Surely would be insane!
This is amazing, probably my favorite video on this channel
0÷0=?
I love this video. The way you use equations, numbers, signs and almost everything that does math I find amazing and beautiful. ^^
Didn’t think this video was gonna be THAT interesting. I had too get a calculator for this entire video, manually entering most of the equations. It was a trip lemme tell you
My dumbass stopped understanding after 1+1
Ahh yes my biggest enemy math
Wow I Lear a lot about math thanks you for teaching us about math thanks you soooo much I didn’t know this can you make more videos about math plsssss
I learned more from this than math class
no pos, si antes no entendía las matemáticas, ahora solo tengo ganas de no aprender nada, solo entendí los de 1+1 hasta las cuadradas y desde ese momento no entendí un pomo
Alan, in one point I felt really lonely and for split second the things changed on loneliness to Atack on Titan type shit LMAO XD.
New series?
Didn’t think this video was gonna be THAT interesting. I had too get a calculator for this entire video, manually entering most of the equations. It was a trip lemme tell you
Alan, un chico con mucho talento, tanto que incluso usado algo tan aburrido como las matemáticas pudo aser una animación super entretenida e incluso si pones mucha atención, educativa
O tanto quer deve demora pra animar mds você é literalmente igrivel Alan
This was absolutely amazing! The animation, the use of all this math and just all of it in general! Absolutely amazing work!
9 hours after release and is 6th in trending.. HOW
Tony stark works be like:
POV: you dont undestand whats happening in this video
Alan’s coolness is impeccable, unfathomable
Капец.... Не знал, что есть такие значения и количество кругов/колец. Было реально интересно...
this is the video that makes me love math❤😂
I’m bad at math but this kinda helped thanksb
Esperaba un vídeo de Minecraft pero esto fue mejor
my brain hurts :(
this was amazing!
This video made me relax, thank you very much
The talent you have in making animations
Xem thôi cũng thấy áp lực :)))
I got lost the moment the basic stuff stopped 😅
And I thought math couldn't be cool
wow wow wow😮😮😮😮😮
Was it a time travel request   I don't  know....    Excellent
Another great amazing video!!! 🎉
help
I love your videos ❤️😍
I've learned too much calculus to not know what's going on here.
Guys I think Alan was trying to help us with our math homework
Alan please teach me high algebra
1+1=2
1+1=2
One of the bests
Llevo 3 minutos de y el video ya me parece increible no me imagino lo que queda
I love how the first part of this video is basically just Little Alchemy but math edition.
The fact that I just shared a maths related video into the group chat....
As someone who despises math with ever atom of my body, that this has my respect and full miniscule attencion span.
Imagine they redo the animation vs minecraft original, but using math instead of minecraft.
This sounds like interstellar music 😳
13:46   is that the letter א? How did from math you got to hebrew thats like two completely different things
Animation vs p--o-rnhub pls
we need part 2
Good video👏
Temas que entendí: Sumas. Restas. Multiplicación. División. Elevados. Raíz. Propiedades. Angulos. Algebra. Terminos algebraicos. Angulos. π. Rectas numericas. Radio y otras partes de una circunferencia. Quebrados. Operaciones de segundo grado. Algoritmos. Negación.
just AMAZING
Now do animation vs science
That is great! Everything was correct and I learned some things too!
This video is so good that it even got to top 30 in Russian Trending tab on videogames.
Speaking as some who finished their math minor, I am amazed at this animation and also reminding me of my PTSD in those classes
did i just learn math
Es 5
Це просто бомба як це зробили не уявляю собі!
I can't believe I actually watched a 14-minute video about math by Alan Becker.. Man, I love this guy
Math..
still waiting for part 2 on that one episode, good work and keep it up!
this is awsome!
Кр¥то€ βид€о!
I am really bad at math i can to the basic stuff and adding to the fact i have Dyscalculia And dyslexia isn't easy for me so the i enjoyed the action happining in the video while also trying to understand what is what
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat in the great grand squrew in the backside was that
Math lore
Everything from the transitions to the little interactions with all Euler's number were honestly perfect.  I haven't been so engaged in math since middle school and even then I didn't understand as much as I do now. I think this actually made me kinda like math, in the best way. Thank you for this, you guys did amazing!
Sound effect is soo satisfying

🇷🇺 Очень круто, как ты показал до жути скучную херню в настолько ахеренном виде. :0 🇬🇧 It's so cool, how you showed boring thing in very interesting way. :0
This should cannonically be a dream TSC’s having while in his jail cell sleeping
If instead of enter cyberspace it was enter the mathspace
Timestamps for those who dont know what some of this is  0:01 The Epic One 0:19 Addition 1:19 Subtraction 1:39 Euler's number to the power of imaginary pi 2:23 Multiplication 2:26 Parenthesis 2:34 Division 3:04 Exponents 3:31 Fractions 3:39 Square Roots 3:50 Imaginary 4:01 Imaginary Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi 4:09 The Chase 4:43 Fighting with Functions 5:16 Back to Math 5:37 Theta 5:52 Radius 6:38 Pi 6:44 sin and cos 6:50 Circumference (I think) 7:09 Imaginary sin 7:19 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi (again) 7:26 Another Fight 7:35 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi turns into a Sigma Notation 7:39 Sigma Notation Shoots imaginary pi to the power of n, while n is 2 and will stop until it reaches Infinity, so he can shoot an infinite ammount of imaginary pi to the power of n 7:45 TSC multiplies the radian to 4 to have enough to make a circle and multiply the circle and the pi to make the circumference and use it as a sheild 8:24 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi is multiplying himself by... dividing... 8:30 not smart enough to understand that but you can see what TSC is trying to do 8:40 TSC with a gun vs Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi apocalypse 9:46 that doesn't seem fair 9:58 DA GIANT INTEGRAL 10:02 aw he sounds cute 10:17 TSC changing the position of the circle 10:35 TSC just found the most op math function even though he only had 10 minutes to learn it while he have to take years 11:16 TSC launches himself to get Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi 12:11 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi spares TSC him even though his knowledge of math nearly killed him 12:17 TSC learns for Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi (god im tired of saying Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi) 13:04 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi creates a portal for TSC 13:33 zeta (ty to reply for this 1) 13:35 The Golden Ratio, or phi 13:36 Delta 13:39 Thats a BIG aleph 13:49 The + End = The End (I think)
13:05 for those confused about the equation at the end:   (for clarification r means the radius of the n-dimensional spheres).  the sum of the volume of 2n-dimensional spheres (so a 2-dimensional sphere is a circle with volume (or area in this case) pir², a 4-dimensional sphere is a 4d sphere with volume (pi²)(r^4)/2, ...) equals e^pi if you replace r with 1 (which is kinda insane).  the formula for determining the volumes of n-dimensional spheres with radius 1 is (pi^(n/2))/(n/2)! (which is seen at 13:05).  i think what alan is trying to say here is that orange teleported out of the math dimension after euler's number (e) added infinitely many dimensions.  (i edited my comment to make it a little more clear.)
Вот  бы  такую  математеку😊
Oh my god, the massive amount of creative design behind this is phenomenal.
I dont understand nothing but I love it
I did have a world similar to this but not close, where there were living numbers, The larger they were, the more important and powerful they were. However, above 4 digits, they would collapse under their weight and split. So the number scientists invented the Multiplicationer, Which was a machine that can both be used to enhance numbers and most importantly, shorten them so that they can grow more powerful while not collapsing under their weight. Then decades later, The Exponentializator was created, then a giant war broke out fighting over the powerful machine.  However, this is a really amazing take! Better take than i had.
bro can make math fun
Bro never in a million years would I feel nostalgic about math, not that I don't like math but damn it brought me back to a bunch of math subjects in high school
I am early YAYYYYY
i feel like these little math dudes are gonna make a return eventually
Overtime its hard to look at things as normal than seeing nothinf but math equations
Ox o vídeo foi postado a 9 horas tem 2,2 milhões de visualizações e só tem 228K de likes???
How was VidCon?
7:33 he did it. He became a Sigma male
I love how it switched from basic math to mega fight with math using methods from university
I understood only a few things there but this would be an awesome video to show a class to explain what each thing means as it comes along.  😂
Honestly you guys should stop being surprised at the art and just surprised at the craativity
Imagine a video called "animation vs science" i wuonder what Alan will made
I LOVE IT AAAAA
Esta genial este vídeo ❤❤❤ Lo super amor 🥺
Dear god man. The level of effort and skill you put into these are crazy.
XD not surprised even figured a way for math to be neat. really epic on how managed to even think up a plot everyone could fallow even if wasn't a math nerd or such like XD very cool
yay
we need a video game version of this because I can't make a gun and shoot the letter e using normal math
nice 😎👍
The only time I like learning math
You actually made the math fun for once
Epik af
I don't take exams after watching this especially if there is a mat
Conclusión:las matemáticas dan miedo y no hemos visto nada aun
as someone who just finished Algabrea, this is great.
Best animator ever
This video is more impressive than ww2
Do Animation vs system32
Orange is the litteraly anti "I have no ennemies", bro even Exponential function wants his death
Es invreible como el simbolismo signifique mas que las propias palabras para nuestro incomsciente, permitirndonos entender todo esto🎉🎉🎉
yoo
*My Brain During The Math Test:*
What is the amazing math nerdery did I just witness
Alan Becker the only math teacher that makes math fun
The edit them like a movie
And this is how I learned how to do math.
Math made it to #6 on trending. Thats kinda insane
When you try using a calculator for the first time:
a wat more video pls😊❤🎉😮
Part 2:math problem :part 3 revenge of the maths :part 4 final battle
9h ago uploaded and 2.1 million views wow 😮
Math turns into an elden ring boss
I don't understand any of this, jesus will i have to learn this in school?
Maths battle. Brilliant
I know it’s impossible, but this specific video demands an _equation_ to express how awesome it is
Animation vs meth
My brain is not braining
Schoolchildren: have been learning math for 11 years, this guy in 14 minutes:
Literally mathematical lore:
It’s animation vs Minecraft episode 30 all over again
Anyone smell toast?  My brain burning out:
*I HAD A STROKE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.*
10:02 Man from England fights someone straight out of Chicago.
Me watching this in middle school knowing what is coming for me
1:00 - Orange is french, never have I felt so betrayed
Now I feel Ω
My brain during a math test
Wow what a smart way to end🌚
I’m to set back by the amount of math problems they had the know to do this animation lol
someone remind me of this in 2-3 years when I know high school math
If we ever send data to aliens on an intro to/translation of "Human" mathematics, this would be it.
School in a nutshell:
The first time math are interesting, lol
I dont understand this video
:requested animation vs maths part 2
Simple algebra to trigonometry to calculus. You just made my most hated subject into an interesting one. I love your creativeness ❤
best math lesson😋
Bro I am on Summer vacation  I said no more math
Bro teached me more then what i ever know in 10 years in 14 minutes
For those who asked about the letter in the background, the letter "a" in Hebrew is the only letter in Hebrew that is represented in mathematics and as one who speaks Hebrew I learned what it is out of interest and it represents different meanings of infinity    למי ששאל האות ברקע זו האות "א" בעברית היא האות היחידה בעברית שמיוצגת במתמטיקה ובתור אחד שדובר עברית למדתי מה היא מתוך עניין והיא מייצגת מובנים שונים של אין-סוף
ive never been so excited for math in my life. awesome job Alan
This is fricking amazing. Ignoring just the animation, there is a ton of math in here. I could've just watched this video and been done with geometry
i wonder what would have happened if he did 1337 ÷ 0
yoo i didn't knew math would be this much fun!! luckily i know math and understand almost everything in this video.
Insane work!
better concept than last marvel films
Hi Alan! Im your biggest fan! Maybe you should make an Animation vs Roblox! (Like the games Natural Disaster, Doors, and others.) So, what do you think?
I never knew math could be so fun.  I hate math tbh.  LOL😂
I don't know if this was written by the same person who made shock, but if it is, I'm so happy to see Terkoiz work with the goat alan Becker on projects like this :)
😊😊😊😊
Grzegorz Brzęczyszczykiewicz
I just watched an entire video about math, learned pretty much nothing, and is still impressed.  So glad you got the success you have today Alan, can't imagine how dull the world would be had this channel never existed.
Idk about you guys, but I think this needs a sequel!
This is the best, most enjoyable, well animated Math episode I've ever seen 😂  I loved it! 1 + 1 = ¿?
I need someone to explain what the hell was that giant thing at the end😮😮
Me gustó mucho el vídeo y aprendí más sobre las matemáticas gracias y suerte Alan Becker😃📓
This man just made an animation about MATH now thats crazy!
Holy shit, he summarized all my of college math classes and more in one video.
Math is indeed a powerful enemy to have, because it's potential is unlimited.
Alan tiene tanta creatividad que convierte algo aburrido en algo divertido XD
ахриненная анимация))
Next marvel movie be like:
Bro this is genius!!! 🤯
this is amazing, imagine how cool an animation about chemistry would be
I want a pt 2 now
Matemática e muito difícil d entender, mas esse video essa mt bom
I used this for my exam, and i think i am gonna pass
Now math is fun for me :D
THE NUMBERS MASON! WHAT DO THEY MEAN?!
Who Didn't Get Confused????
Genial!
bro i thought this was things like 1+1 or 2+2 but is my whole school year 💀💀
Math level- 100000% 😎Respect😎
I’m gonna come right out - what the fu
I feel Alan and his lead Anim thought to themselves: “Subtitle this, jackasses!”
Bro's litteraly talking math. A nightmare come true
thanks
1+1=?-•+_=2
This make me Love math
bro what...
א
Is that mathrama?
Well done!
That was ... remarkable
bro, this video is the BEST revision for the bac lmao
Honestly the most impressive Animation I have ever seen It's one thing to come up with a plot for the animation but making something like this is just wow
What every person in an education system fears in their dreams. Being beaten, failing, or defeated by math.
mait you just made math fun haha! ^^
bro orange and the e guy are smart
Math Vs animation
Where Orange Go after when he enter in the portal
You make the best vids thanks to you and your friends/ teammates 🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊❤
Amazing ❤😂
+ My brain = Hate maths - My heart = Loves Alan's animations +My Brain - My Heart = -I'm here watching it
this is some of the most wildly uninhibited creativity and imagination i've ever seen, period.
Bro knows more math then my brain can even hold
TSC learned to not fall asleep while "playing" the calculator in the pc again.
What's happening around 8:32? The 9*tan(π) thing that becomes a function that seemingly cancels out e^iπ? What's with the backwards harpoon accent? I don't understand and must know XD
im too stupid for this
This is the greatest using of MATH to crate battles. I am seriously you just used math rules to create something like the ULTIMATE LASER or that number cyborg. This is a lot of work
Bro Just Made Math Fun  How is This Even Possible  It Actually Made Me Google and Remember Old School stuff a lot of them
O melhor vídeo de aula de matemática
Alan, you never fail to amaze me with your animations. As a math nerd, this was absolutely incredible! Keep up the incredible and creative work that you do!
He learned more math in 14 minutes than I can In my whole life
Welcome to Baldi's basics and education and learning. That's me!
tremenda flasheada boludo
I LOVED THAT, WHAT THE HECK MAN I DIDN’T KNOW YOU COULD TURN MATH INTO A MOVIE-
Bro, is this a short or is this the second episode, my brain can't handle all that math if it matters
I have never enjoyed math so much
No entiendo , lamentablemente voy e secundaria y me encantan las matemáticas,  pero el ¡e(pi) , salvo al hombre naranja?
my brain cant handle this
This was sick af
Animation VS. Meth.
:O just :O
bro alan u NEED to make a part 2
this is absolutely incredible. the sound effects and the way everything moves and the CREATIVITY in this is BEAUTIFUL i love every second of this
alan really invented math for this animation 💯
Nice vid
AH yes i cant understand everything from this vedio this is the true math.
you did not just make math look fun
This is a good example of what I see in math class
OH!
oh my god this fills me with so much seratonin watching all of this. im a math enthusiast myself, and im loving seeing all of this in visual form. its a work of art
My worst enemy. Math
una maravicha perfeito  :O
cool! i still hate math tho.
Bro graduated math in 15 mins while we graduate in 12 yrs
ok but why the e mad?
Exam to ultrakill to test to ultrakill to undertale. Wow
My childhood in 14 mins
This is the only way learning math in school is useful
I could literally watch  14:02 minutes x 5 times Consecutively. This Is The BEST Alan Becker video made  since the finale I give it a 10^10/10 Outstanding
so... Euler’s number has access to trans-dimensional travel. Awesome.
The fact that i spent almost 15 minutes watching a video about a stickman doing math and i loved it shows how amazing this whole thing is
this is really mathy
Did you just connect numbers to aliens?
I got to say this is by far the most exciting way to use numbers
Matemáticas
NEW VIDEO, YEEEEES as always, alan becker making legendary videos, 10/20
Am i the only one who did not get the ending?
The teacher said math was useful
*oh god TSC is becoming too powerful..*
His flash account wan nougai right?
brain not braining
Thank you Alan for exam preparation!)
Thanks I understand math now.
that was good man
What time do we have for animation vs animation vl EP.2.?
this guy is alive incarnation of creativity
That is SUCH a birthday present, Thanks Alan.
I love math now !
Euler and the Sigmechs
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ORANGE IN THE FUTURE (LIKE EP. 32)
if math was a video game
This video makes math really funny but also really hard since a 15 minute video can be made with the concept of it
The coolest most nerdiest thing I've seen in a minute. The sound design is really what makes it feel more epic and I think communicates....something that I can't explain from the math involved. 👍 Also I hardly like anything, but this? Liked!
Ah, so this is what's he's up you while Paused
Fantastic! Man Vs Math love it for the idiot savants trying to figure out math problem that takes me 5-10 minutes to solve when it takes everyone else less than that amount of time  Great animation cool
This was so amazing!!!! The best part is when I understood all of the math he was using. But the best part to me was seeing the progression from very basic math to super advanced math
Nice animation
I have no clue what I just watched... BUT IT WAS AMAZING
I wasn’t expecting an animation vs maths video to be able to include a bloody Death Star, yet this man has done it
This is amazing. I didn't expect that math to be so much fun.
Looks like stick figure is like learning math like school
I feel smarter after watching this.
U can animate AND do math?
That’s the best mathematical video ever
10:35 That's no moon...
bro is teaching me more than my math teacher
7 ON TRENDING??!!??!!
Espectacular
Animation vs language?? When
create a series of this for the love of god alan please my family depends on you alan please
no way
No entendi ni la mitad de calculos y cuentas en el video pero ver como The Second Coming usa los simbolos matematicos como armas me encanto.Muy buena animacion y una idea muy original
Hello
omg top
i just learned math thanks to a Alan Becker video, each day is a new learning
10:03 yoo waterblight
Looks like someone got into the calculator
you should bring back imaginary numbers into a animation vs animator 6, as it helps orange
I always enjoyed doing math in school, something about it was just satisfying to me. THIS. RIGHT. HERE. Makes me what to go back to school just to learn more of it. Absolutely awesome!
I think the sound design is quite an underrated highlight of this animation. The bleeping and clicking as everything falls into place is so satisfying to listen to.
10:00 Waaaaaa!!!
buenísimo
His talent so powerful, hes able to animate MATH and make it entertaining
this is true CREATIVITY
I'm halfway through and I'm absolutely flabbergasted over HOW DID YOU TURN MATH INTO A FIGHT?
I wish Math was this cool in the real world 😆
This is the best video ever, I even sent it to my math group at school and they loved it
Pov: when i'm running of math
nobody make math cool and fun alan:
wtf
This gives me serious Doodle God vibes. Maybe it’s just the music but it just gives that kind of primordial feeling.
Cool video but I read this as Animation vs. Meth for some reason and now I'm slightly dissapointed..
e
Math? Xd
This video makes me not want to continue maths in school
Learning math with the second coming
bro becomes an expert at math bro i need him XD
didn't expect the gamma function to show up and also the alef at the end. Repeating exam from mathematical analysis next week and not so depressed anymore.
I only sort of understood 7:09 to 7:19, but did understand stuff after that. after 7:53 i was mostly lost
better than my math lessons
I want to see him use math in the flight with the other caraters
bro actually made maths interesting
My brain in explode xDDDD
Bro made math look cool
wath
The video quality was high and it was very funny.
Que se fumo alan para crear algo así
Is this cannon if so to what?
HOLY FU/
Math ain't mathing
이 영상은 문과들도 좋아할걸요? 액션만
Unironically one of the best things I’ve ever seen.
This is the best thing I have ever seen.
In a few years, ill remember this animation when my teacher is talking about math. And then ill just be like "Hey i remember these things from that one stick animation! "
Any other animator: How am I supposed to make a video about mathematical equations epic? It can't be done  (Enter Alan Becker)
Most unrealistic part of the video he misses a catch on the  decimal
They turned our math stockman doodle ideas from middle school into reality holy shit…
where is bro
If We Got Animation Vs Real Life That Would Be Epic
pleaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeeee make mooooooooooooree
What happened if u divide by 0?
im pretty sure im one of the only ppl who called out each math symbol in my head when i saw them
🤣 GENIUS
I wish all maths would be this level of fun
ah yes meth
I learned more about math in this video than I have in school.
2 ^ 64 = 18446744073709551615
POV:your 6 years old and playing with a calculator
I'll pretend I under
Cuma berawal 1+1 menjadi begitu menakjubkan
Я досихпор ничего не понял. Но это было весело, а ещё мне было грустно в конце когда оранжевый человечек ушёл от е. Это было очень грустно сценарист зачем так делать 😓😓😓я понял что у е ещё остались друзья но всеравно они не прошли и половину пути что и оранжевый которое всю серию гнался за е. А ещё у меня есть предположение что эта анимация была вдохнлвлена с анимации A B C и там и такм познавательно / развивательный контент!
😊
1 + 1 = 11
8:37 this weapon
ITS MATHS NOT MATH (lol)
Olha no YouTube Um mais um é dois
This is astounding, thank you for sharing this content, i enjoyed every single part of it :D (Even if i suck at maths)
I can wath this every day!
okay this is just outright amazing  that's all i gotta say
I read the title as animation vs meth 💀
Okay but what would happen if Orange did 0 ÷ 0?
This episode episode was very spooky to watch
I just have to say, the sound design and music choice behind this is amazing.
Oh yes, the original way Euler discovered math.
This is insane, great job
I love the dramatic score!
THIS IS INCRIBLE
If anybody ever says math is useless, have them watch this video.
Where did Orange go?
nice video Alan im fan
I think this is what being on drugs is like. What did I just witness
This feels like when ur in math class and u draw stick figures on your homework, and the math fights back because you should be doing the math work and not drawing stick figures.
Math power be like:
What a interesting math fight
Okay I don't think math can explain why there's a fricking graph kaiju at the ending. Heck if I can participate in kaiju fights in math class, sign me up!
8:17 reminds me of terraria for some reason
This made me feel abit like when I first watched interstellar
that. Was. AWESOME!!!
Its soOOo intresting!
The only math I want too listen too is alans
I have no words
when i am going to use this in life alanbecker: now
Math have traumatic effects on peopl and drive them crazy until the do a videon on how to fight math lol amazing
ESTO ES TAN GENIAL !!!!
This is one of the greatest videos I saw on youtube this year, without doubts. Phenomenal story with phenomenal sounds put into it.
This very likely has already been said but if not then I’ll do it, I learned more stuff from this than all my years in school.
first time i ever liked math
This is gonna be shown in schools and convince people slightly that math is cool.
I don't understand how the second coming got to that mathematical dimension
MAN AMAZING VIDEO . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK .I HATE MATHS THOUGH""
As a math student : It was one of the best video I've ever seen in my life
Can you pls make an animation vs subjects series? And btw, math is my favorite subject! Thanks alot!
It was one of the BEST 14 minutes of my life!!!!
Reminds me of Donald in Math Magic Land, except with combat.
Arte, definitivamente esto es arte
Just, Wow !
Just wait until the shorts creators hear about this.
How we fight math
My 12 year old son sent this to his dad who then sent this to me… Very cute!
I can make a couple of math jokes but I’m only gonna make a few    How the teacher wants you to show your work:  “The test isn’t that hard” *the test*   Me calculating how much time is left during class:  The “way” my parents did math back then:  “When the 2 smart kids have different answers”  Me concocting a game plan for the squad:   That’s all I can think of for now but this vid is crazy. Good job team  When your a nerd and you see your crush:
This is AMAZİNG!!!!!!!!!!
Did I just learn everything in math in 14 minutes?
What Maths Exams feel like.
Dude, only Alan can make math seem so badass
So glad this is on trending
Math has never been so interesting
Part 2?
9:45 sounds like something out Transformers. Good god this was awesome!
Bro really flexed his math education on us! ✖➗➖➕🟰
e....
Amazing  how you make math look cool
Alan, el único capaz de mezclar matemáticas y Stickman
The animation is learning to much
this is nerdy and cool
I know I hate math in all but SC really was just coming in hard with the harassment
Omg
As a math enthusiast I will admit that everything in this video was really fun to watch, and everything demonstrated was done creatively and understandably. (most of the time) The different ways math was used in these animations was very cool and I'd love to see more sometime. Good job Alan and team!
This is BOOOOMING by the time I’m commenting this. It is already #7 in trending I hope it does well!
your animation should be worth millions and billions of dollars and you should win 20 oscars
desde cuando las matematicas son divertidas
Ep 2 plise
The + End? Hmmm... How about "Animation vs. Programming language"?)
THIS WAS MADE ONLY 8 HOURS AGO AND ALREADY HAS 2MIL VIEWS. dang Alan, your great at making video's. Keep up the good work
Imagine if students took notes on this
I didn't think making math awesome was even possible
Amazing
Why cant you like more than one time??
too much for my little brain :v
now i love math<3
geat
Impressionante 7:20 KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK NICE !
Animation vs. Terraria.
13:46 why is there a large "aleph" in the back and what does hebrew have to do with math?
You are the best animator in the earth
MOOMMM  YEESS IM STUDİYİN MATHS NOO İTS JUST A DİFFERENT METOD :D
I love the way Alan did the sound design!
What a fucking masterpiece
We’re all Lucky they didn’t find out about 0 divided by 0 💀
my assumption is that this took place in the calculator app. or like, desmos.
This video has made me want to learn math just so I can follow what's happening.
babe wake up number lore dropped but fr this is amazing
If a math teacher showed this in class for a fun math vid. That math teacher would earn respect of many students and would prob become a favorite teacher
Just soo good
How could you have explained both the complexity and the perfection of mathematics in one video... I love it Especially e^iπ and Orange's fight 💜
It's awesome
I, WANNA, 2 PART
#7 on trending while i'm watching, and I understand why. (Edit) Now it's #6
ngl this makes me enjoy math now
Absolutely MMMMMMMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNDBLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THESE ANIMATIONS NEVER CEASE TO BE AMAZINGLY CLEVER
jak zawsze wciąga bawi i uczy
The way that the chosen one is presented as not having fun but being genuinley interested is such a great subversion of Alans tropes!
Чел я такой эпичности нигде не встречала! Анимация на высоте! Сюжет супер! Ты просто гений!
I don't know how you do it, but you found a way to make something as boring as math and make it so entertaining that I would watch this over and over again. Kudos to you dude, keep up the good work!
i really love this animation is like every frame has a new level.... this is Amazing 😳   the sounds design... bro,!!!!🔥🔥
10:02 Funny scream lol
my teacher explaining the maths:
este hombre nunca nos decepciona
can we get an 'orange switching numbers around ASMR' bc that sounded satisfying for some reason
This video increase my love against math.
Calculator VR: the game  When?/j
Dgegz
10:59 reference to star of dead
😂1+1=2😂
What a blessing Alan teaching us to multiply, add, divide and subtract XD 😝
no way brro made math look cool
Did you just manage to make math fun?
I need game VERSION!!!!!
It’s 2
the "n" at the end was so scary
there is to much incredibleness going on here to unpack. but lets just say the sound design is incredible
This is good.
1+1=11
me learn math? nah im watching this instead
Perfectly capturing the utter confusion at how Euler’s number keeps popping up when you don’t expect it
The + End = the End
oh no they math kakakakak
Teachers should to show this once on their lessons.
5:00 me dodging all my bad grades by cheating on all my exams
Is anyone else in love with the shield made out of the surface area of a circle? That was genius
wow.
❤
Turns out your solve get destroyed the answer.
ALAN BECKER CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE LIGHTING FROM WANTED 2 PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE!!!!!!!
Is anyone gonna question how Orange got stuck in this void?
Khan academy has nothing on this
Alright kids, now we can see that math could be fun.
This took waayyyy too long to animate. Thank you all so much for this. Y'all didn't have to put so much effort into it, and yet...
i wish he could make me a charter name brown
"And it all began from a single one." - The wise commenter that can't spell
That was awesome
he managed to make math an interesting topic
Today's lesson: Just do your homework
Aprendi mas en este video que en clases xD
The creativity of this man is out of this universe, man's can make anything out of an animation and it'd turn out amazing.
No my brains
This is beyond amazing. Honestly one of the best animations I've ever seen, period.
WOAH I LOVE THIS!
school
WOW!! THAT WAS INCREDIBLE!!💖 you are a master of animation Alan Becker, I loved the video!!!😆 but it was hard for me to understand the calculations that TSC did 😅
leave your like or if you are not gay 😎🥸🙉
I don't understand nearly enough math to get what is doing what and why, but it's still the best action movie I've seen I some time
If there was an actual way to do math like this, math would be the best class ever
What animation system do you use?????
Juste Exellente à 1000%x10²= plein de coeur pour cette vidéo digne d'un bon film.
Alan your work is amazing this is my favorite animation bc I love math
Wow ❤
Alan, please make this a game.
Im a nerd so I already pay attention in math class but if math teachers already did this I would love going to school every day
THIS is incredible
Como ingeniero que soy, ver este video es un orgasmo visual indescriptible.
After this animation I don't need math in school anymore
This is the best of the animations, do you know which one it is? obviously the action and adventure I love your animations alan 🥳🤠
A mathmeticion on high amounts of no no stuff
the power of maths🔥🔥🔥
I liked how e kept switching his dimension
I mean orange could have just used x0 (multiply by 0) to make everything not exist, but that works too (;     (I'm not hating, this is a great animation!)
Im too dumb to understand it but i love it! 😆
Thanks to this video, I have officially become one of the most smartest Mathematician on Earth.
Math is OP

You are doing so great WE want more episodes  please we can't wait
If they aren't showing this is my math class I'm not going- 😌😌
This should be shown to students in school. It shows just how fascinating math is.
Cuando va a sacar el animator vs animación 6 PT 2      When will the animator vs animation be released 6 PT 2
What the fuck, this is súper diferent at the math in the real life
New animation from alan becker STONKS
Have i seen sqrt(-1)?  Nevermind it was used before Euler came by
Absurd... Nothing more, nothing less
Extremely well done, congratulations
imagine the 4-10 yr find out wat there goin to get into in math
I don’t care how cool this looks. I still hate math
Yo what the hell
The hardest boss yet...
Lord Farquaad liked this
😮😊❤🎉 awesome
Bro can take the most random thing and make it a video for example  ANIMATION VS SHOES!
Алан гений
this was honestly an amazing video, i never expected something like this to be uploaded. i simultaneously like but hate math, and i understood next to nothing in this video, aside from the fight scenes. the background music felt majestic, you should add a full version of it.  all in all, good video.
Awesome 👍🆒
WHERE DID TSC GO? Should've shown him meeting the others. But great animation! I've always been a math geek, so I really like this one!
hes the only one that can make math fun change my mind
I knew there was going to be a divide by zero joke there somewhere.
The legend post a new video
33+77 = 110
well, at least he met with mathematics😅... not Baldi😰
Thank you I imitate you a little
Learn math at school:❌ Learn math with Alan:✅
Alan Becker + 💻📱 + ✏🎬🎞 + Math = 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Queeee
I love this, I need this in my life
Simply magnificent

i literally have no clue whats happening 80% of the video
as a person i have no idea what I just watched
Lore math be like:

At next: Animation vs languige. And German would be funny.
I'm a 3rd year engineering student and I loved this. I understood about 90% of what happened and loved it. The fluidity with all operations, how you used the Euler's number mathematical capabilities to the max and both realms of Real and Imaginary numbers. This is my favorite video you have made, thank you...
This is so nerdy and I love it
Giving me flash backs to some of the stuff I studied during GCSE maths; 26-28 years ago. I think I can actually feel long dormant brain cells firing back to life...
Alan is the only person that can make Math fun.
Это просто гениально! Мне очень понравилось. 👍
🎉🎉🎉
It would be amazing an Animation vs Code as well
오..내 머리가 불타고 있는거 같은데
If Alan was an math teacher, this animation would be the reason for me to love mathematic!
Yellow would have a field day and a half there
I understood the first minute. The rest was just awesome mumbo jumbo xD
this is one of the most funny videos to me as an engineer😂😂
superbe video
Bro imagine he does one of music theory with sheet music and all that shit
Вау, це було неймовірно 😳
EPIC
It is one of the best videos (in my opinion)
I love this, even tho I didn`t understood half of these equations. But I don`t need to, to love this video. Thank you Alan Becker
Thanks Alan for giving me math lessons. It gives me more knowledge than at school honestly.
this is how teachers should teach math
bro can make anything cool
it same like a cauculator or something and this animations is the best
Bro actually turned into Albert Einstein💀💀💀
:o
season 2 when?
"math is fun" this animation:
cintinue please
As a dumb little smooth brain I only understood 20% of this video
who tf said that math are boring
Thank you, a lot.
I was hoping orange would grab  the 1 and break it in half. A half plus a half is a whole. Then jump in the w”hole”.  But frick it. This is much better! ❤
As a math nerd, I can confirm that this is the most beautiful video on YouTube 🤓
some stupid people: math is nothing, it sucks math: (explaining the universe). Idont understand some themes but good job doing the math and the animation alan i love u :D
....
As a math student I must say I'm impressed by how amazing this was. Just, at 8:26 you made an animation/a math error : e^i*pi becomes e^-i*pi out of nowhere... The real question to everyone is : "Until when did you stop following the math references ?" I think I caught everything including the real and complex "world/dimension" I didn't understand Span() but because I don't use that notation, instead : Vect()
Never thought id enjoy a vid abt math, but here i am
THIS WAS SO FUN TO WATCH I’m like hunting for all the stuff understand and seeing how you’ve made it come to life, I wish I had more people to geek out about it with TwT
Words can't even begin to explain how good this is   so ill let math do it  10^googol
Егэ профильная математика за 14 минут
This was awsome
beautiful 10/10
when they take the words nolege is power to a whole nother level.
The biggest symbol or character=The alef
We making it outta math class with this one 🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥
as a person who's terrible with math, Great job on making this interesting and amazing!
Очень приятные звуки
This is legit the single best video about math I've ever seen
Next Up: Animation Vs Chemistry
i don't like math but now I do like math
Esto es una obra de arte ♥
Plot twist: This is a simulation of his journey from 1st grade to calculus
I hope I could see this video when I was in middle school, that likely I wouldn’t be so bad at math and felt it very boring all the time
I learned more from this that school
This is so fucking cool
HOW COOL IS THIS!??!?
you some how made math entertaining and more confusing at the same time  (also how did TSC even end up here)
Finally taking maths in school didn't go to waste.  Great video 👍
I guess that's why we should learn maths?
i know everything before e appear
Bro to much for my brain, good job...
数字を武器にするところが大好き
What if the math is a story
Nah bruv explained math faster than my teacher the fuck 💀
No way in the end I see א this is my language Hebrew עברית הי שלום א
THAT VID WAS COOL!!!!!
can someone make this a game lol
some of the math here got to symbols i didn't know but knew that it was being used for this small plot
Litterally how long did it take to animate all that
I'm not intelligent enough to fact check every single math done here, but it looks awesome!!
So cool
i would kill for a game like this
This is amazing.  Keep it up alen
Wow, bro. Just - wow
I talk in spanish.Que se fuman los guionistas de alan para hacer esas animaciones.i ❤ math's alan😘
And then kids say that math is boring
Wither storm vs animation
SFX work was incredible on this, love how everything sounds and feels like this high tech mechanism unfurling and locking into itself
i liked it it was amasing that the second comer made a infinite gun then an omgea gun
This is waiting room for Animation vs. Programming
Dude this is amazing!!! Also I love how TSC Got along with Eulers number and Eulers number made new friends too!
This is a whole new level of awesome! I've never wanted to understand math more
Woooow wooooow woooooow 👏
I hate mahts, How did you manage to make me in awe of them ?
E
Make Animation vs Stone Story RPG
this is probably the coolest way to learn math.
this makes math more better honestly.
You have the best math teacher if he does a lesson on this video
That music at the start tho
me on a math test:
Wait, but they didn't fix the Infinity Cannon! The e just sent Orange (TSC) away, and then wandered off with the other obscure math symbols.
Great now I can’t do math because I’ll be thinking of this and not my homework
this needs part 2 who's with me
“Animation Vs Math” what else is there gonna be?! “Animation Vs Space” “Animation Vs Anything else”
Ok
YES MATH 😂😂😂😂
مفيش عربى غيرى ولا اى؟
this has done more to teach me math than school ever did
The fact that this was on trending for gaming is so ironic
Average life of a mathematician, gotta keep stopping e^¡(pi) from expanding forever
alan literally made me like math right now this mad is truly a legend
I want to play gama like this video
YES Oh my God
4:40 is this a reference to the fight between clippy and the chosen one in the orginal ava series?
Я не понял всем судь этого видео можно заскозать 🤔
That was fire beyond belief I don't know how he did this he made it so that you can learn something from it it is the greatest masterpiece that he has ever made
sword beam mode 10:34
👏
So _that’s_ why my calculator was broken the other day…
I love the end with א the infinite of all natural numbers
if you think about it, tsc just attacked e^i pi for no real reason. he just attacked e^i pi because he felt like it.
Welp my brain just melted
My math teacher would put this on during a good thursday
Talent.
This made me search for my calculator just to confirm that 1-2 = e^(i*pi).  Great job Alan Becker.
All that I can say is  I am early.
This video showed me that I have so much to learn in math
big א
animatoina kaq të lezetshme
I've always been fairly decent at math, but also always struggled with division. And I'm not gonna lie, 2:32 help me visualize it so good! Thank you alan becker team!!
Alan and co. thank you for everything, honestly. I can say for 100% certainty that you guys are the only channel I never see myself growing out of. Fantastic work
If I ever become a math teacher, I'm showing this to my students
Bro started from kindergarten to 12th grade math
thank you
Não traguei esse final
imagine society if math class was like this
I, I am just to stunned, I, I am at a lost for words, The fact that Alan and his team could create something like this! I love the combonation of education and animation and this could really teach a whole generation if broadened enough
You just made something better than most modern cinema today, and no one said a word
e
10:04 that little war cry makes me laugh, its so cute
Cos of the lack of explanation, I like the implication that TSC just spawned in the Maths World. Headcanon is that this is somehow Yellow's fault

Infinity times better than the she hulk show
for all the minors out there in freshman high school, you KNOW that this is going to be rewatchable once you complete each year.
this is better than most anime
Fun fact: The Second Comming was just stuck in the calculator app
Fuck i loss my brain
absolutely beautiful of what you and your team did, but after what i saw at the end, I NEED MORE AvMath
Now do English
coolest thing ive seen in a long time
SC just learned math faster than any other living thing is capable of
Aprendí más aquí que en la escuela
Im only in 4th grade and i don’t know all of it
Love the animation. But this give me PTS from GCSE maths
Wow
A huge 'א' in the end :)
My mind when i try to make math fun:
This… this is genuinely genius
"How much of this math do you know?"  ...Apparently not much
He found the perfect way for an animator to learn calculus
11:01 TSC LITERALLY MADE AN HAMMER OF DAWN WITH JUST MATH LIKE WTF!!!!!
This is a mathematicians wet dream and I’m loving it so much
😮😮😮😮😮
Aleph at the end
Perfect👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
My Brain is Hurding from all of this Math.
My Brain is Hurding from all of this Math.
i can't understand what they made because i m 8 years old
I love the fact that he's only just discovered math now and he already knows more than me
Que imaginación la de este hombre🎉🎉
О нет математика мой ночной кошмар
Believe it or not, i actually learned some math while watching this animation. Go Alan!
El mejor video de Alan becker
Mathematics is something great and beautiful, just with the level of study that I have, I understood 37% of the video Great job :)
Booom thats so interisting, Alan you'r the beast teacher of math bro
How alan best content creator animation
If only I didn't fail algebra
To all YouTube certified Genius people,    Prove this : 1÷0 = ∞
I love it but my brain died at the division (not that idk how to do it just I got bored)
👍👍👍👍👍👍
the equations are briliant bro
learn in school ❌  learn with alan becker ✔
Haven’t grinned so much in a while, phenomenal animation <3
How to learn math in American way+ But Good Ending
my brain 💀
太強了真的太強了！！這表現力，這富有創意打鬥，加上縝密的邏輯！完美呈現了數學的魅力！ 這部影片居然正好出現在我重考的時候！！原來數學是這麼神奇的東西！！
Congrats
this is beyond math.
it went to highschool type math in a matter of 4 minutes
Some how watching a stick figure do math is interesting
The pie is a lie.  The e^iP is definitely a lie
This is the best I've seen today. some modern films can only envy such an action as in this cartoon.  Alan, you're the best!
hmmmm wonder who could teach me more, SC or an Indian guy on youtube
never ever disappoints my god
Откуда вы всё это знаете!?
This video increases the total global populations IQ
Now I… still don’t want to learn math…
Bro’s literally fighting with math rn😂😂
1:29 For half a second, it said 100 - 1 - 198 = 98
As someone who studies maths, further maths, and physics, and is a wannabe astrophysicist, this tickles all the right parts of my brain. The smoothness of orange using the two half's of pi to find the area of a circle and make simple harmonic motion. The fight of orange trying to figure out how an exponential is connected to "i" and pi really shows how complex maths is, even for the simplistic things, like the simple number of "-1" taking up the form of the exponential of "i" pi, and how all these numbers connect is demonstrated really well. The level of detail in showing all the numbers of "square root 2". How orange panics when he divides 6 by 0 and the long division process just goes on infinitely. Using the volume of a cylinder to attack by changing the values and make it extend. When the exponential changes to sigma and shoots the sums of pi, i with an infinate range, with the range decreasing with each shot to act like a magazine, and all the decimals that shoot out when they hit orange. The infinite range of the function shotgun orange wilds to take out all the exponential's. And the exponantial's splitting using the fact that any number is itself divided by one was really cool.  Even the visual of how the "+1"s layer into the the 3rd, 4th, 5th (etc), dimension to show powers is brilliant. I thought your knowledge on animation was already very impressive Alan, but the fact that you can animate so well and also have a great understanding of complex maths and physics is amazing. Well done, and keep up the good work :)
My New mats teacher alan beckersjskskakak
If you understand what happened you are math teacher 👩‍🏫
woah
Detesto las matemáticas. Corrompen a las personas y confunden complican las cosas. Pero me ha gustado la animación
Aun que no sepa inglés, es una muy buena animación
Si las películas de animación contrataran a Alan, por dios, sería la revolución de la animacion
Bro thr video was like the second coming is eynstyne
The math unbeatable , we still have endless unanswered questions
wooow ❤❤
We want part 2 PLEASE and if you do i well sub
This is actually insane. Having just graduated as a math major and honestly being burnt out by math in general, being able to follow everything going on in this video and seeing how you turn all the visualizations into something epic really made my day. Can’t help but pause every few minutes. GET THIS MAN A WHOLE ASS STUDIO.
POV:what Richard sees in the caculator

10:03 the scream got me rolling down the stairs💀
"Where will this math be useful in real life?" Math in apparent real life:
Second Coming learnt math faster than anyone in just 10 minutes 😂
13:39 Zeta
📚☝️
lesson:  *nothing and nowhere in the animation world is safe*
e × i π
It feels good to understand every thing used in this video.
If Alan Becker was our math teacher, math would've been the best course to take
6:57 is the DNA Symbol, nice one allan
When math is actually fun
Oh yeah, that's the good stuff. I'm beginning to be confused and my memory is foggy on the last third but I still remember a lot. Definitly made me miss doing math.
Entendí solo la mitad de las operaciones matemáticas pero realmente disfruté mucho la animación y me dejo con la boca abierta todo el video. Muchas gracias Alan ❤
I can finally say that everything was calculated B)
This video alone made me achieving my math degree much more worth it 😭❤️
The scream from the e got me rolling down the stairs💀
I would like to know math well to understand it better xD
HOW IS THIS GAMING
please someone believe it in a video game
Only alan and the gang can make math EPIC
Holy crap one of the coolest ways I have seen math be used teachers most show kids this video ❤❤❤❤
.
what did i learn from this?     e but then big E
I can"t evan praise that level of creativity.Its Incredible😮
Yes! Got a new reason to hate maths!
EPICOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, INCREIBLE, MARAVILLOSO, LAS MATEMATICAS SON LO MAS MARVILLOSO DEL MUNDO
all you have to do is = x 0
Can't believe Alan Becker just made a video that's going to be used by elementary math substitute teachers.
Mathcraft.
This feels like getting inside of a Math Simulation
Insane video
Incredible
Estuvo chévere 🤙
This is how we should learn maths 😂
Sabes que Alan es un genio cuando puede hacer que ver a un muñeco de palos pelear contra un montón de letras y números con armas que también están hechas de letras y números, sea entretenido y epico
How?  How did you do it?  How did you make MATH cool?!
how many times did i learn math in my life? twice.
My brain hurts-
I think I had a nightmare like this once back when I was in School and had double Math...
This has to be one of your best and most creative animations to date . So beautiful, with the black background and white Evil Math.  The music was also brilliant, and truly enhanced the experience.
I can't believe math can be that much entertaining 💀 Can't wait to see "aleph 0" in action as well!
this is the best way to learn math (I think)
Mr Harvard: pls come to Harvard
ive never been interested in math but im just watching a stick figure doing math and its cool
Just WHAT!!!
78!
Get the nerds out of the room this is gonna get nasty
The animation is amazing, my brain hurts
what is =f(•) ?
This is so much better than the movie
Okay when since math became cool
holy shit man this is damn good!🔥🔥
I cant- Alan Becker isnt getting more attention like he used to on the AVM. I wish THOUSANDS of more people would watch his videos, and get very rich from doing that. Great job Alan for this video. God bless❤️❤️❤️
There should be a game like this.
-Math is tire..... -:
animation vs team fortress 2
and thats how sc became  smarter than yellow
Mom: Son! What are u doing in there? Son: Watching maths equations  The math equations:
el profesor de matemáticas viendo el video  joder esto si es cine
In my Top 5 videos I’ve seen on YouTube easily
How he get there in the first place
I don't know anything 🤯
Well, i now feel like I'm a math pro
Me when i'm bored using my phone's calculator
if math just could be like this (with the music)
This was epic
As someone who's gotta take Calc 3 next semester, this was pretty amusing to see and actually made me like Euler's number for once
When math is the most op thing in the universe and u just can't understand *me: what? 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro’s learning too much in the matrix. Man’s made Math cool by using transformers sounds and Sci-Fi.
wow....
So, can a maths major please explain to me, in Laymans terms, what all of that was?
this would be a really cool style for math tutorials
I never knew math could be so cool

Cómo hago tan estresante como las mate se puede volver tan  impresionante?

This is amazing I love the animation how it’s so smooth it honestly makes me want to do math
Is this canon
As someone who has a deep interest for maths and science, it was marvelous
I like the stickfigure's style  Throw punches and ask questions later
Учим матешу с секондом❤❤❤
I like how you made the death star out of maths
Whi not the mincraft creepepasta like can't sleep blood warden error 422 Giants Alex
I didnt think math could be so cinematic
Welcome back to youtube alan becker
how make math interesting
that's how i got A-s in mathematics as well
Someone: Math is boring  Math:
Lol
א
What is א
That was amazing 🤩
i have no idea how this guy managed to make math cool  Also, i dont understand this high-end math magic, but im gonna assume that all of the equations and stuff are correct. In which case, props, i could never even begin to reach this realm of cool  Also also, what is the "i" for?
Wow this is done so well, I loved everything and it certainly explains some of higher math to a layman like me.
Skadoosh 11:05
you're my best animator youtuber i love you vids. Btw i watch you from 2021 or longer.
2:06 boys when they hit puberty
how is the lead animator as smart as albert einstien. also this made me watch it fully with me not pausing
This guy literally makes math fun
This has taught me more about math then ever before
vata f*ke?😭
Was hoping for fourty seven straight minutes of yellow writing proofs, but this will do also
I love this video2+2=4
My math teacher would love this
I don’t NEED school mom, I have Alan Becker >:(
This actually taught me math and destroyed the nerds in my class 🤓 also e iπ
:0
Love the way this personified the transition from simple concepts to complex expressions. Incredibly done! 🙌
MUSIC PLEASE
Teacher: How did you learn all the math in 14 minutes? You: Well...
You learn more math from this video more than someone would for their whole life. Euler has respect.
Muy bonito y entretenido❤😊
Somehow made math badass
i cant stop watching it
I don't know math, at all. At least, not outside the basic stuff, but this was still one of the most beautiful stories, even if I didn't fully understand it. That just speaks to the artists abilities to convey story. Absolutely phenomenal. Loved it.
in a couple of years, when mankind has disintegrated itself, someone will come across this video, downloaded on an ancient computer and go: Oh, so this is what Math is.
This animation is just fantastic. I think i watched like... 5 times lol
I wish I could learn math as easily as TSC
my brain is exploding right now
Alan Becker the man who created a stickman smart enough to figure out math and weaponize it in less than an hour
Dreams of my teacher
1+1 = o           /|\            /\
QUICK MATHS
Today Marks the day, where my class mates and I face of against Maths and its Army. I may not make it out alive but, to all those who read this message, Wish me Luck.
first time i've willingly watched something related to maths and enjoyed it, never thought the day would come
if i was a teacher i would play this video for fun
5 stick figures doing math. what could go wrong?
Woo
That’s incredible 😮
Lovin it
this is on my birthday. I didn’t expect anything like math today lol
Finally, a visual representation of the average student during a math exam. At least, I think it is. I'm not that good at it, so in my eyes, it looks like they've figured out either a fraction of the Anti-Life Equation or the question to the Answer 42.
dang the animation looks so fire🔥
WTH was that gigantic thing in the end?
bro got me at θ
Linda animação
the best is the video of music createdin minecraft
as an hebrew speaker i like the refrence to the aleph  [i know thats also a  number]
10:05 This is how integrals are hard to compute 🤣🤣
What the hell did I just watch. I'm speechless
I dont understand a single thing that just happened but this was sick 🔥
My mind is blown in way too many levels to calculate
ANIMATION VS. KHAN ACADEMY
Last thing we would want from u lol
really cool
Can you get work oh episode 2
Why is thats so good and real 💀👍
I am an 8th grader and after this video I don't want to learn math anymore.
Death Battle be like:
My math is not good enough to understand this animation
number lore if it wasn't mid
Wowee
cool
"Math is Easy"  But then it be like : 💀
What i think when teachers say math is fun
I want to see a game that works like this where you discover different mathematical concepts by playing with numbers
Hi there I come back after a few years, and I say this is the best one ever!                           If I wasn't ruined by 2 ads!
Bringing a whole new meaning to askii art
If i was in the math world, ill be friends with Euler (the e) ! Everyone agrees?
Kudos to you and the people who did the sound.
All the math sounds are satisfying as hell!
"If math was a video game, this would be it."
Wow alan becker do popular now lol😂
Math is fun again
AAAA IT WAS SO COOL!!
WOW!!!! So creative!
This man just made math not borning,he needs an Oscar
For the love of all things Euler, UNLEASH THE MATH!
FINALLY!!!
I don't know why I started getting A+ on tests
these animations are geniuses the only part i understood was the beginning and im old enough to get more than just 1 + 1
Świetny z ciebie matematyk😳😳😳😳😳😳
esto fue un viaje, y fue increíble
Bro made math cool
Rare footage of me on my final test
The moment when I wished Alan (with his team) was my math teacher/lector, but in real life the only thing I had been got was only to being TSC and a part of that vs-hardcore... Hopefully, I was saved, but not by the math like in this video. And the video is really great and feels like: ((AvA)x5+(AvM)x23+AvYT+Av(Mario)^0.5+Av(AG))^2
my retarded brain vs shitty math that i dont know
Im just in 4th grade but if this concept is true abt math damn yes I'm gonna love it
Hello hello I’m back again with another chat with you. I am your number one fan is back so I was just walking out. I was just wondering all the videos that you make so far are awesome cool and in the incredible even, but would you rather get voice actors to voice, the characters, orange, pink, red, blue, and purple, and mostly any other colors for that matter, plus would you rather try to go to another crossover between all the different universe is I mean besides the Pokémon games between the manga and the versus battle, not to mention All the black yeah and then I got tons more
i didnt understand half of these math references but this is awesoome
Alan Becker inspired multiple people like me I'm truly grateful
This is so cool how everything is math❤🎉😂
New element math
I understand and learn a lot of things. thanks  you for this video
Alan seriously you have a very big talent to fascinate the spectator and we all thank you for your work  🌠🌠🌠🌟🌟🌟
حبيت تباين الألوان في الخلفية ❤
Animation vs. literature must exist now
Hi
The lesson we learn from this is Learn math it is not annoying and boring but rather amusing and eintresting and amaising
I wish they had a scene where orange was messing around with the calculator app and accidentally divided himself by zero
Ok ok ok. First, this is the most fond I've been of Math in a long long time. Second, this is a GREAT rendering of mathematical concepts and I love it. Third, Orange delved too deep into the animation program huh? He found the mathematical layer.
Ouo
This is crazy good
4:42   BEGONE DEMON
this is "Animation VS Eve Online" change my mind!
There is a lot of talent and effort here, I congratulate you and also your team 🥰🤩😉 Greetings from Venezuela🤗🖐💛💙❤
This would be extremely educative if it wasn't for the cool action and story that attract the watcher's attention.
Some math teachers gonna have a field day showing this to his class
me in a math test
This one animation and a class of discrete structures I am taking is going to be the sole purpose of why I'm now creating an alchemy-based game about math. You truly are an inspiration.
Bruh. Man just learned math to escape from backrooms.
I don't understand anything
This is truly unbelievable. Isso é realmente inacreditável. Esto es realmente increíble. THANK YOU – OBRIGADO – GRACIAS 🙏❤
how did orange manage to get here?!
<3
wow you are so cool bro
im more confused as to where Sc is and how he got there
I didn't understand half of the equations, yet I still loved it!
I’ve been wait for this ever sense I started to like math
Does everyone else understand the giant x at the end
this is what im thinkin during math
Es asombrosa 😮 Segunda parte plis😊
Hi my friend asked me if i could ask u for a tamagotchi video btw shes a big fan of u and will not stop taking about ur stick figure animation s
He can't keep getting away with it
Math lore
I like the good ending of the short animation when the ''e'' letter and Orange stop fight themselves and being friends.
I know all of this math
Alphabet Lore vs animation be like:
And I thought mathematics are a nuisance but seeing this video I realize it's very interesting and useful and unusual to see now I think I'd learn more about this and good beautiful video to see now I think I'd learn more about this and good beautiful video
Alan allways seems to suprise me i hate math but if math was this fun id be more motiveated to it amazing animation alan 1010
Why you need to learn math:
math lore be like:
2:46 cuando juegas en la calculadora
This is the content you watch at 2 am
Bro can find out math equations faster than me lol
Now we wait for a "Mathematician Reacts To" video.
"Oh yeah, I remember when the math teacher showed us this video in class", I hope that's what my future children say.
como hacer que las matematicas sean divertidas:
Wow just wow,  i'm speechlees
I have never been so enthralled in mathematics or probably ever will again.  Jesus this is good, great job Alan!
The end, as aleph null follows the rest
Wat the hell was this
This is really cool, I have not seen anyone animate so well
Good math lesson
so a square from the circles grid is 1m, i found this out bc orange takes up 2 of thoose, and bc orange is as tall as 2 mc blocks (1 block is 1 meter) 2-1=1
math has truely never been both this terrifying and interesting
better than my math teacher
Richard was right, this game isn´t half bad
I never loved the math like this
math lore goes crazy bro
This video is art
i can’t even do basic math properly wtf is this
in the near future we will for sure get animation vs clocks
1.9M views in 7 hours is crazy dude keep it up ❤
Shoulda seen the stupid smile i had on my face while watching this Really amazing video
Alan is the type of guy to make math cool 😭
Now I know that e is dangerous.
This is wonderful and mind blowing, thank you guys so much !
Это супер велеколепно, не мог оторвать взгляда, суперская анимация, очень клёво!!!!
congrats my brain hurts now
that was amazing work actually, now it's my favorite video with stikman's and soo... wait a second what the!... are these letters from the Russian alphabet? I see our letter B and letter F there waaaau)) thank you for such a reference, it's nice)) but even if it just so happened and is not a reference, thanks anyway) Thanks for video and for making me remember again the values that we passed at school)) <3 спасибо большое)
8:25 if you have i in a fraction, it should always go on the top as -i
im in 5th grade. wth is this wth is math
Someone needs to do a game of this
How does this mans only get better at animation though
This is way better then actual math
04:14   i'm so in love with these kind of details, the slight frame where the Euler's number multiplies the i betwaan them to create a minus, that he uses as a weapon after that i have a feeling that alan"s girl will soon become a mathematics genius in less than 15 minutes !
me, playing with a calculator:
this made me think so much about math dude
I need a 1 hour break down of this video and all the math concepts in it stat.  This is insanely cool.
i love it!
wow
10:03 wahhhhhhhh-E 2023
first we had letters in math, now we got stick figures, what more do you want from me god
Idea: animation vs scp foundation
my brain cannot understand what is happening XD
Wow good!
This is the coolest shit ive ever seen
Dude this was so good
You almost got me to watch 14 minutes of math ,nope not this time Alan!
welp. i have a new favourite superpower to want when a genie asks me about that.
10:00 waaaaaaa
Alternate title: Stick figures learns how to weaponize math and goes on a killing spree
I like e
This is the first time I'm looking at math and I don't feel sleepy
you are my math teacher
Pov: you are bored in mat class
This man just watched too much matrix
This is cuteeeeeee 💖💖💖💖💖
SO THIS IS WGT ALBERT EINSTEIN IS SO SMART
This had better be a series.
10:35 It appears Orange just reinvented the Hammer of Dawn. Good for him.
I''ve learnt more in this video than I do in actual maths lessons.
The most interesting math in my life.
Can we all just unanimously agree that Euler’s number has just been chillin there with the other constants in the calculator app this whole time
All that math for the first time finally made sense 😎👍
MATH.
Wow
this video freaking confuses my brain
Bro taught me more in 14 minutes than my math classes did in 108 days
Get a mathematician to react to this.
Infinity rounds were/are simply off the scale impressive. Thanks for an excellent video - and hurrah for the lead math nerd animator!
that might have been one of the best videos you have made, and it is very welcome amongst the engineering community
This is undoubtedly the most entertained I've ever been learning math. If it can be considered learning when I'm just in awe of the complex animation and thought it must have taken to have incredible battle scenes AND actual functioning math.
woooah, sure glad to see oll aleph make a cameo at the end
wey mi mente
Damn Alan just took Vi Harts title of having the best math youtube video!
a lot of people dont even click on the video bc its math but its worth seeing
I wish I understood this more
Your animations are too good. You are the best one, also Animator, you need the 100M
Does anyone else feel like their brain is small after watching that?
So good animation
Wait till TSC finds out about advanced physics and multivariable calculus
Math really is deadly.
Nada mal papu
this is amazing it just shows math and how its done its amazing for learning. and enjoyment
I was able to follow along until about 7:30 where did everyone else start to get lost?
i understood almost all of this
❤❤❤
this video has taught me two things: 1. more maths than my school has done 2. dont break the fabrics of time in maths
Tsc learned more math in 10 min than me in years
Isso é simplesmente incrível
Would totally kill to have TSC be my teacher, and this is how’d he’d teach.
Me in maths on the calculator
bro hes just make a battle with math respect
O my god, I don't understand nothing, but looks so cool
gonna watch with my math teacher
Just watched this on Reddit. Had to come find it here!  I wish I were better at understanding math but I border on dyscalculia. My brain works in block of information, no precision. It leads to me transposing numbers constantly.  I can, however, appreciate some of the functions, models, etc in this and what they express… so I definitely enjoyed it! Probably more so than just pure explanations of the concepts because this shows them in operation of sorts! Thank you!
There is so much we don't know about math. Great animation btw
i like that this video is getting more cooler and confusing at the same time
for the power of maths
lil mabu watching this vid "don't let that go over your head"
my brain trying to comprehense what is going on:
This deserves a nobel Prize and to win an animation and art contest! This is amazing!!!
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa me dan ganas de ser profesor de matemática
This video made it worth every penny to take college level math.
Quem é do Brasil comenta nesse comentário
2+2=5
Aprendí más de matemáticas con este video q con mi profesor
its beatiful. Its amazing
As a Mathematics fan I can only say: QED ∎.
This was serious mindfuck for me. Like dude, I already dislike it, you don't have to make me scared of it.
gotta be honest i understood some stuff
He's  discovering
This is the best video in the world
I never thought that math could be so awesome!!!
i think that was the coolest video i've seen in years
my brain hurts
9:30 nah bro he just did a weapon of warframe 😂😂
Orange literally made the firickin DEATH STAR!!!
Gagagagagagagagagaga
He getting smaller by the second a bit to smart
Tsc made math look more simple yet more complex at the same time
uff ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 This is art, the video, the idea, the music... it's wonderful 👌🏼👌🏼🔥
4:58 a numbers like i are real
me when "e" attacked orange with "sin"s and "cos"s: 😨
MATH WEAPONS
Bro can someone explain all this math to me. I understand the basics but like “Euler’s number”? What the heck even is that.
it's wonderful
Absolutely breathtaking and the most wonderful animation
yea i still dont understand math
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
alan and his team are the only people that can make math fun. because my god it was so fun watching this!
wauuu ๑•̀ㅇ•́๑  eso fue fenomenal 💜😎💜😎👏👏👏
Absolutely AMAZING!!
Now I know what I’m gonna learn next year
Is this what College is like
You should make a animation vs Qremaster video
My brain is frozen from all the maths I don’t understand, and perhaps probably never will But it was sure interesting to watch, as always!
IT IS COOL O MY GOD
Now i want an animation vs programming so bad
This just taught two year olds what A^2 + B^2 + C^2 equals. And I know I didn't do it right, I did the best I could. It's A, B and C squared btw for those confused
не ну такой математике я бы научился
Mathematics is so powerful that it can destroy mathematics
Dang that was a good animation just like the rest of yours Alan
the big number is aleph null omagad the refrenc
i knew i shouldnt have taken acid during algebra
Wow. I don’t think anyone would not like it. It’s amazing!
I've never been so focused watching a stickman learn math.
make animation vs. polish
did this guy just learn maths in this video?
I love the music :)
i have 10yo im begining to be a little scared. help
By watching this 3 times I now understand 40% of the confusing things in this but now I don’t know how to explain 💀💀💀💀
now i wait until some person makes a video explaining every single thing in this animation but in simple terms
Second coming has got to be one of the smartest or creative stickfires on YouTube.
I am preparing for the baccalaureate, and I can tell you that I revised, Alan , thank you 🎉❤
who knew math could be so awesome?
Timestamps for those who dont know what some of this is  0:01 The Epic One 0:19 Addition 1:10 Simplification 1:19 Subtraction 1:39 Euler's number to the power of imaginary pi 2:23 Multiplication 2:26 Parenthesis 2:34 Division 3:04 Exponents 3:31 Fractions 3:39 Square Roots 3:50 Imaginary 4:01 Imaginary Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi 4:09 The Chase 4:43 Fighting with Functions 5:16 Back to Math 5:21 Graphs 5:37 Theta 5:52 Radius 6:38 Pi 6:44 sin and cos 6:50 Circumference (I think) 7:09 Imaginary sin 7:19 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi (again) 7:26 Another Fight 7:35 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi turns into a Sigma Notation 7:39 Sigma Notation Shoots imaginary pi to the power of n, while n is 2 and will stop until it reaches Infinity, so he can shoot an infinite ammount of imaginary pi to the power of n 7:45 TSC multiplies the radian to 4 to have enough to make a circle and multiply the circle and the pi to make the circumference and use it as a sheild 8:24 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi is multiplying himself by... dividing... 8:30 not smart enough to understand that but you can see what TSC is trying to do 8:40 TSC with a gun vs Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi apocalypse 9:46 that doesn't seem fair 9:58 DA GIANT INTEGRAL 10:02 aw he sounds cute 10:17 TSC changing the position of the circle 10:35 TSC just found the most op math function even though he only had 10 minutes to learn it while he have to take years 11:16 TSC launches himself to get Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi 12:11 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi spares TSC him even though his knowledge of math nearly killed him 12:17 TSC learns for Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi (god im tired of saying Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi) 13:04 Euler's Number to the power of imaginary pi creates a portal for TSC 13:33 Zeta 13:35 The Golden Ratio, or phi 13:36 Delta 13:39 Thats a BIG aleph 13:49 The + End = The End (I think)
Learning with violence
i wanted to see how they divided 0 / 0
Que acaban de ver mis ojos?
This was incredible. Well done.
omg
Bruh
PLOGGERS
Awesome
I am so glad that I studied math at school, otherwise I would not understand this masterpiece
WWHHAAaaAAaaaaAAAAaaAAAAT????
the א at the end is really funny
Alan gonna be in a surprise when he opens up his calculator app and find it all burned up and broken
You should do an "Animation vs bending" that would be sick
If actual math was this entertaining I guarantee more people would be interested in learning it, but in all seriousness what was this, it was both confusing and amazing all at once
Aren't we going to talk about orange literally exceeding infinite dimensions?
1+1=2
Tell me wth is happening I just forgot half on it I'm halfway
simply the best animators on the planet
So this is what math majors go through.
this is better than alfabet lore and number lore combined
This makes me want to learn math because I don’t know what the hell was going on half way-
God loves you
this is what happens inside the calculator
as a guy who have 0 iq i can confirm this video hurt my brain
CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE
(f(•) × r) (e ^ (i × 3.14))
A video about my trauma, yaay.
Epico deberían sacar un juego de esto
Math when you miss that one day of school
Imagine all of the main stockmen characters, blue, red, green, yellow, orange, purple, vs the 4 math things, the giant X and stuff
i didn't understand one bit of this
Teacher can you repeat?
Boring(
So good!!!❤❤❤
This is amazing...
You can even do math so enjoyable, yaa offf, you're so good
I learn math for ate years and Orange in 14 minutes 😅
School nerd be like : 😂
Bro literally created math lore
Не думал что будет так интересно смотреть на математику
Now THIS is how you should teach MATH
I like math and this is awsome!
Me at university
Now every time I have a math test I will remamber this❤
THE + END = ???
damn now i like math
This was CREAZY
Alans creative is beyond human level. Mans found a way to make almost everyone’s lest favorite subject fun to watch
The only reason I’m good at math is because it looks like this in my head
My math teachers can’t teach me math…  This guys lead animator:
Math, I love it!!🎉
hi plis me spanich pls you pls (nose entiende nd lose)
Это ПРОСТО ОФИГЕННО! Алан просто идеально справился с задачей "Совместить интересную динамику и экшен, боёвку в стиле Стикменов и на минуточку, математику" Мне крайне интересно наблюдать за его творчеством. Желаю дальше всё больше впечатлять и подогревать интерес фанатов
watching this stuff makes me feel really dumb..
f(infinite) = all 0
This is sick! I enjoyed every single bit and detail that actually made the mathematical sense there. The imaginary world, the expansions of e^iπ, and just the aesthetic of the video showing the mysteriousness of imaginary numbers, and showing how from simple algebra and operators, you get to circles, π, complex numbers, infinities and so on.  Definitely worth the watch
I love that Euler's Identity is the "villain"
The Second Coming took the phrase: "knowledge is power" waaaaayy too literally excellent work as always
This guy really just made the most boring subject fun. Alan never cease to surprise me.
Now i am scared of math
As soo bad the vid hit 2:30 my brain just when complete relapse on itself. Like WTH, that is complex math right there, holy moly.
Лучший аниматор на просторе интернета. АааАааааАаАаа, Что происходит??!???
I didn't understand anything, and i love it!
teacher: pay close atention!  my brain:
Bro he made a dead star we math
Perfecto❤️
me having absolutely negative math knowledge, but still enjoying this, incredible work. I'm sure the entire video made sense for those who really do understand and use math.
Lol
Mu new favorite math class
The fact that the e multiplied itself by i (which is an imaginary number) to open a portal away from reality to escape says so much about how creative alan is.
I not underthand null
As an engineering major this makes me happy
Who else only got about half the math? I feel stupid because in 10min a orange stick figure with a hallow head could figure out rocket science with me just knowing how to do 2+2.
Poverty you divide by 0
I literally just came out of a math tournament and i love this
Shit about to get real when he figures outs how to do real analysis 1 & 2.
i learn more with this than in the school not kidding
This way I understand math more
man I suck at maths so all of this confused me as I try to go down to the depths of my mind trying remember what means what
More math content pls . it so good and learn math is cool !!!!
math was never so much fun
WOW THAT WAS AMAZING i really like how rc have that big canon 😄
GOOD JOB!
WHERE WAS THIS ANIMATION TO HELP ME WITH UNDERSTANDING INTEGRATED MATH ALL THIS TIME!! Well made Alan, thank you so much show your creativity to the world 💖💖
10:02
If Alan Becker do an animation Movie.... damn
i cant believe i watched 14 minutes of an orange stickman fighting with math, and i cant believe i loved it.
8:16 HOME RUN
Animation vs my worst enemy
The fraction,multiple divisions,adding,subtractingand square numbers are just too real
You continue to make some of the most creative fight scenes of all time
Animation vs. Stats next lol
I absulutely hate math, but damn this was satisfying to watch! gj
Me in a matt class:
Bro u taught me more about space, matter, and math than my elementary school teachers 🤣
Uma obra prima
This is one of the best animations i ever saw
now, i *recognized* a good amount of stuff here, i just didnt remember how to actually do any of it.  Precalc is too haaaaaard
Not to be rude or anything but orange looks a bit lanky-er than normal
can someone explain the math here 🤓
We.Need.MORE.
My fav animator finally uploaded 🤩
the music is just amazing, love the video, would absolutely want a part two
perfect, now i can watch this instead of revising complex numbers for my a levels
I believe that this video will inspire many people to study math. Who knows! A few might make a comic about this, even an animated series!
This video can be interested for anyone. It filled with mathematics and its "lore", with epic battle. Alan made such a genius video.
orange when he picks up the infinity:  *the power of the sun in the palm of my hand*
Who knew math could be fun to watch.
The power of MATH everybody
¿ What Happens If T.S.C Divided 0?
👍 x 1,000,000,000
I haven't touched anything more involved than some light algebra in about 15 years, but when he started touching on trig it tickled some memories I didn't even know I still had... Wild!
Is he smarter than yellow tho
I wish you could solve math like this
Viewers: Hey Alan what you making?  Alan: Oh, just a little something.  Viewers: A new Minecraft shorts episode?  Alan: No...  Viewers: Oh well then you're probably making another Animation vs. Animator episode  Alan: Nope, still  Viewers: Okay wait a second, if you're not doing any of those you're probably doing another game based one like that one Arcade episode  Alan: Stop asking, you'll never guess it  Viewers: WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU MAKING THEN!??!?  Alan: Animation vs Math  Viewers: Wait what? I didn't think I heard you correctly  Alan: ANIMATION VS MATH  Viewers: What now? HOW THE HECK ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE A EPISODE ON MAT-  Viewers: Oh wait this video kinda good.
Math
Nunca pense que me gustarian tanto las matematicas
4:41 is it just me or does it look like hes holding a cross
and THAT is how I lose all the weight
It’s so cool having a grasp on the first half of it, yet getting to be completely in awe of what could happen when they delved into math that I don’t yet understand
Everything I know about math in 15 minutes 🔥
We bout to see some anscii animations
Ni marvel hace tan semejante obra maestra
Okay. This is the most creative thing you've ever done
Animation vs Meth?
-1^(1/2) = i
i love how tsc just seems to be having so much fun with all the math.
Браво анимация очень крутой
As a student, I can confirm finding e randomly is as frustrating as you make it seem.  Also thank you for giving the best item in math (i) a shoutout, it never gets as appreciated as it should.
Taught me more than my junior year math class
bro turned maths to fun
Imagine if this was displayed in our classes!
Im still barely passing math help me guys
5:06 this looks like a bow from elden ring
Seven hours yes
İnvincible 👏
if only math is this fun 🤣
This is THE BEST video i ever seenand because of this i want to learn more about math :)
Have you ever thought about doing stickman vs fatal error?
Um mais um é igual a 2 laranja
10:35 ITS A PECKING DEATH STAR
tat is cool
what in the world just happend
no entendi nada pero esta goood
Somebody send this to my math teacher to see if he can keep up
n^(-x) = 1/n
3:29 n⁰ = 1
Amazing!!! 👍👍👍
This was beautiful, i really loved the "the + end"
Alan you really need to make a game of this your animations are the best 9:06 (game part)
Amo las matemáticas, entendí y ame el video.
Learning Math with the Second Coming:)
THE AMOUNT OF MATH THAT MUST OF WENT INTO THIS  THIS IS AMAZING!
bro teached me math faster than my math teacher
The only time math is cool, is when Alan Makes its
holy. fucking. SHHIIIIITTTT!!!!!!! THE SOUND DESIGN!!!!!! FFUUUUUCKK!!!! IT LITERALLY MADE ME CRY IT WAS SO GIRTHY AND BADASS!!!!
3:04 n×n = n²
Yo this was awesome and so creative🔥🔥
NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH RE INCREIBLE ALAN BECKER QUE ORIGINAL ESTA VEZ SI TE PASASTE. TE MERECES MIS APLAUSOS!!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏
6:46 se volvió mas inteligente que yo
Why is a youtuber doing more animation than Disney, this is impressive
imagine disliking this masterpiece, if you do so you must be jealous of his talent.
Written by Terkoiz? My man never EVER misses. I swear.
Orange must have explored the Complexity of a Calculator's code. The only logical reason, no? ☝️🧐
2:48 x÷(n-n) = ???
I'm only 3 and a half minutes in, and honestly despite the obscure stuff like tesseracts and fractals and manifolds not being included, I'm adoring this. This needs to become a real interactive VR program or something
The animation 😮like wow dude
Узнал больше чем за 10 лет учёбы
ดูคลิปนี้ ยังเข้าใจคณิตศาสตร์มากกว่าครูสอนอีก
interesting
This makes my head hurt
the final boss of math
This was how math was made
Nice Aleph at the end
bro took “find the value” to a whole another level
me after watching this animation:🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Wow
Lets go another animation already
my favorite math class
I never thought math would be so interesting in a stick figure animation and so complex
Absolutely Brilliant. Never thought math could be so entertaining!
10:02 "WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
2:15 -(-3)= 3
what's next Animation vs the dictionary?
א
Watch this video in 2x speed, everything is so much cooler
Omg this is sooooooooooooooooo.       Cool
if this gets hearted by Alan He is good YT
The sound design is insanely good
Ah we've all been waiting for this banger
AMAZING!!!
oh my goodness this whole fight was awesome but seeing aleph null sent chills down my spine
Нам не хватало такой визуализации)
This is beautiful
If this was the positive end... Then what would the negative one be like?
So awesome
well now animations vs chat gpt
-1^(½) = e^(i×3.14)
power of math 🤓
bro who let him cook?
Ooooooo esta súper
My braincells are broken after this
Me fighting my math homework at 2am:
This is amazing, I love the fact that they can turn numbers into weapons and any Star Wars fan would love THE DEATHSTAR!!!!, jokes aside this is amazing and I hope you great in the future😊
The most beautiful math animation
f(.) Turns into gun, lol
La verdadera pregunta aqui es ¿Como naranja llego hay? Bueno si esto es parte del canon
Why was there the letter Aleph (א)  in the Hebrew at the end ??
From basic arithmetic to calculus-based graphing algorithms, this video showcases how versatile mathematics can be.  It's a shame I couldn't progress greatly beyond AP-level Calculus; the logistics and other theoretical concepts behind such a discipline elude me to this day.
Me when learning complex math
I didn't think I would like math until now lol
Pls make the second coming use the power again
Yolo
Math Lore = This Video | Math Gameplay = Actual School
Слишиком эпичная математика
squrt -1=i
I didn't understand the end
Omg the Math is so hard
COMO
As a math nerd I can say this video is amazing, the animation is really well done and the math details were also really cool, keep up the amazing work to Alan and the rest of the team :D
mine blown bro 🔥 The amount of all mathematician terms and theories... you have gone through a lot of study for this episode. love the creativity❤
Las matemáticas si que son poderosas
Honestly, I will watch this until I understand this concept.
Bro  TSC taught us how to do math in 14 minutes and 2 seconds
I just got home from finishing a math homework. I love this
שלום אתה מבין עיברית?
Somebody watched a 3b1b video at 3 am
Cuando le preguntabas al profe para que servían las mates; Era para entender esto... Y vale la pena
That was truly amazing, wonderful hearty music, reminded me of interstellar
Coming from a student taking high level calculus, a lot of this actual works, dunno why the government has not been taking advantage of this though…
as a student in precalc it is so cool knowing some of these math concepts that otherwise would look like hieroglyphs
Bro the second coming Is the beat Reacher of matematic
Tsc gonna come back to yellow like *"WHOS THE SUPER GENIUS NOW BIATCH"*
Узнал больше чем за 6 лет метематики
1:39 que iso como que -1 era e elevado i x pi  ¿?
I learned in this Video more Math than in school
Keren bang keren keren,btw salam dari Indonesia🇲🇨🇲🇨
Me encanto, recordé mis tiempos de las clases de calculo en ingeniería
only Alan Becker can make math cool
*DUD~~~~E!!!!!* This was epic beyond anything man! My inner child is going nuts over here! The work you been into this, i mean hell, bet some were hoping do something like this but DANG, to use math like this, this was epic!!! OMG, you think mathematician and physics teachers will make a reaction video about this, cause what unfold here, was too much for my brain to handle or follow.
охуенно...
When you releseed this series i think numbers will fight whit the sticmans but this was AMAZING .  I hope you will make an second epizode !!!😊
Best lesson ever
Quien es el grandote?
power of math
wut
no entendi nada pero estubo good
WOO ALAN BECKER UPLOADS FASTER NOW :)
Now THIS is a math video I wanna watch in a math lesson...
THEY DESPAWNED ORANGE?!
Bro fr made education fun
The sound design is beyond perfect
is this the math equation that becomes a green lantern
Mathematical DOOM amazing, honestly  did not know math could be thought of as a cool FPS
Good Job, I'm sorprised, Math is my favorite class, they still don´t teach us those things.👍
bro i love your videos
is there an Asian stickman
Instant certified hood classic
Imagine a second coming where Animation would be fighting differential manifolds, cardinal numbers or monster groups.
reminds me of game about not touching anything
Holy sh*t Alan
10:02 HAHA! Look at This little "e" screaming!
alan you know all hardest math i cant do it you do it with animation
Alan, can't you make a game, please do it, it will be liked by everyone, please do it 😊
This is the most epic math presentation of all time
mathematicians would be proud of you
0:35 What is the second coming doing? 😂
What was the giant math simboll im the end?
math fans ate good today
We finally know, where the second coming got their powers
I cannot compute
Alanbecker you can do animation vs Duolingo pls
Goddamn this is so good
WOW
this is how math looked like in my brain during high school
oh my god Alan i did not expect something this brilliant on your channel, you are a math god the fact that you can visualize this
dude THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO YET!!!!
the death star
Your creativity knows no bounds I swear. I'm jealous
if school taught stuff in this kind of way i would be smarter than Einstein
Dear Math,  Why don't you solve your own problems?
That was... A weirdly psychological animation. So did like Orange gain a new powerful tool and ally? Or I'm guessing this isn't cannon. Enjoyed the video. Except the part where my one braincell got burned to a crisp,
Watching this made me feel smart fr fr
Wow, if Aliens see this fist they will love us 100%
bro explained how math works in 14 minutes better than my maths teacher did in 11 years
Jesus Christ
1+1 = 10000000000000000000
There are many things in life that I will not understand. And this is one of them...
i made the =f(•) math gun irl
I don't..... Get it
I’m gonna show this to my math teacher and ask them to use it to explain math
Voy a llorar 😭❤️❤️
1+1=9
2+2=5
next up: animation vs m e t h
The end gave me episode 30 vibes
Это Показывает Что математика Интресная
This animation really learnt more math in 14 mins than i learnt in the last 12 years 💀💀
If only I had actually paid attention in math class so I could get a general idea of all of this
🤯давно меня так что-то не впечатляло, огромное спасибо за видео, всё сделано на высшем уровне !!!😁😁👍👍
Mis respetos a los animadores
I'm too dumb for this episode
art🗿🍷
WOW ITS FANTASTIC
we all knew euler is evil
We need simulator game like that!
There was a certain point where I just stopped understanding how the math works LOL
EPICO
Ooh having taken up through differential equations myself i love this lol
bro was so successful in life that he made a video about all mathematics
I can hear my friends calling me a nerd for laughing at this
Alan Becker = BEST OF THE BEST
Helo
I could make a zombie survival game about this. only that it’s made or math, and there would be blasters and melees like the number 1 as a sword
Bruh why can't they just show this video to kids instead of 16+ years of torture
It is ridiculous how creative this is.
this is amazing
well math teachers across the globe, you have a new interesting math video to show your class
alien language?
bro’s (potentially) single-handedly making the generation that is going to grow up with this video to be more enthusiastic about math than any generation ever was
Good idea! I like Maths :)
Alan you are amazing you just made maths more fun this video is amazing hats of to your animation Now, we want Animation vs Physics/Chemistry
Comment donner envie de faire des maths et/ou apprendre.
Smash
Make animation vs science
it took Second Coming 14 minutes to learn what i learnt in 8 years- (edit: and more lol) this guy really is all knowing... praise be him
bro took 2+2 is 4 4-3=1 Quick maths to another level
After watching this, I might need a breakdown video explaining how this all work in mathematics. My mind was blown, and is going to explode.
Started simple ended CRAZY!!!
The foley and soundtrack are amazing
How did this man manage to make math both more confusing as well as more AWESOME in just 14 minutes?! Alan, buddy, a HUUUUUGE round of applause to you and your team!
I don't know much about math,  But this is just amazing 🔥👍
Fucking amazing, but you missed an amazing oppurtiny on fusing (The+End) to = Fin
The way this was made just makes me think about space and time, and existence itself. The endless void, the different plains, and the opposite of what we see, all just boiled down to math. Very nice animation 👍
i love you alan becker keep doing you are great
NEW EPISODE!!!!!!
10:02 bros looking like a final Mario and Luigi boss fight
He Did It.
From "√-1 = i" onwards i couldn't understand any new math shown, but enjoyed either way.  This ideia of buttons with different functionalities hidden in the simbols of math is really interesting, i was thinking that it could be an interesting experience in vr.
Ya puedo aprobar matemáticas
YES!!!! This was awesome! I've sent this to my fellow mathematicians so that they can enjoy.
Now this is how you make learning fun
Tendi tudo
I understand math for 14 mins, thank u Alan
This really shouldve been yellow, it fits so well
Calculators at 3AM:
I have no idea what I just watched but it was great. Knowing Alan, he would make sure all the equations would make sense XD
Awesome animation I love it❤️
"I have the power of visual math and anime on my side!"
For a video about a stick figure fighting maths concepts, the music really made it feel an Interstellar-level of epic. Props to the maths nerd that made this such a fantastic and accurate video
I understood 0% of that math
I fell like I just saw the universe be created
this was so cool
The +end = we are so exited for the next video 😊
Que genialidad de verdad
This would be so much more awesome if I knew some of the math in this, Alan Becker, never stop making these❤
Alan Turing is the Father of computer Alan Becker is the Father of animation
imagine alan discover like the universe in this animation
WHAT IN THE FUCKING WORLD WAS THAT  I SWEAR I WAS NEVER SO EXTREAMLY HYPED BY WATCHING A VIDEO EVERRRRRRRR   ALAN BECKER IS A KING❤❤
I love how this video casually goes from elementary math, and using that progresses all the way to…The second coming using math to make weapons and do battle with *e* ? What? I don’t think that was covered in 9th grade algebra 🙃
La animación estubo de locos eso si no entendí nada de las cosas más avanzadas de la matematicas y tú entendiste 😅😅😅😅
I think his math teacher was right when He/She said he's gonna use these math equation in the future.
this would make an amazing game
"let's make a math fight" "what, just divide someone by zero?" "no, let's hit them with a pi graph and make it into an orbital laser strike!" "you're a genius"
Thissocool
I love the idea that the larger the number the heavier it is.
(2+9)😅
Ah yes i remember the war of 1000 + 900 + 80 + 7
The animation is so smooth!
What is e to the power of i times pi? I don’t know when you’re supposed to learn this, but I haven’t yet.
I've never been so invested in math like this before
i never though that math could be better than meth and yet here we are
Is it just me or i understand math better now?
When math teachers say math will be important in life, this is what they mean.
it’s so awesome how Alan can make so many creative things with only maths functions!!
This helped me with my exam wtf?
But please answer to my question! !!
Bro it's so good! Can't wait for Episode 2!!
THAT DO BE COOL, cant show people tho, they wouldn't get it as I am the only math nerd around my friends
I feel LIT my brain cells conexions  working to understand one: the math behind and TWO: the power level non asigned to every fking math weapon based on the math and the respective significate.
i showed this to my math teacher and i got an A+
we nerds need this to be a series
Mano que vídeo perfeito!!
And I learned a lot
Bro described my whole math career in one animation.
At the start when explaining the basic operations, it might be the common idea to show how it works. Oh, and even others that are in calculus.
You shut my brain down bro 💀Now my brain need to restart
I just gained 69 brain cells from watching this
It shows that Alan can turn anyhting like this into something funny and cool
Wtf
"Its Impossible to make a cool fight scene with math!" Alan Becker:
Please try to create a new animation for undertale/:)
Even though l dont really like math and lm not very good with it this was fun to watch and really shows the complex beauty behind mathematics
И это мне предстоит ещё в 10-11 классе трындець
The doom guy seeing all of the destructive weapons being made;  Doom guy: I take your entire stock!
cant believe that you made a like a dragon ishin reference keep up the great work!!
ı learn math with this:)
This is the only math video that I would want to write math notes on
I can imagine the research and touture this took to make😂😂
absolutely fucking insane and also I'm glad I don't understand math just so I can enjoy all this without seeing any errors or whatever xD
The equations were pretty confusing but the story was spot on i loved it
😢 bom muito bom sabe um negocinho ele botou para casa porque não faz continuação a mesma
When art meets with the math for legendry Video by alan
We need more I loved I bet orange Is going to tell everyone
..... That was amazing.   I'm sitting here stunned, by the creativity and intelligence just witnessed by me on the screen.   Wow. That was honestly sublime.
א
its satisflying
BIG GOOD
Did anyone notice the giant aleph symbol at the end or is it just me
I love he did this all with just 1
I can imagine this all took place inside of the calculator app.
reasons to study math
I can already smell all the MATH LORE GIFs.
Great way to learn math!
for anyone wondering this is the game calculator and our orange dude is the 2nd person  able to beat it. 1st person is richard waterson from the amazing world of gumball. (only true human knows this fact)
This is amazing, such divine nerdiness is admirable I'm having a cerebral haemorrhage
∆^≈≠℅
Whether or not this is canon to AVA is irrelevant to me at this point. Alan and his team are simply too talented.
Fantastic!
Faite un 2 ème épisode c'était tellement bien
How does my man get even more creative each video
What..Tipes oF..DRUGS?, BrrroOOoo. OmF GOOAAAD. LIT, this is D best math battle animation ever... EVER.
I have never had my brain so confused in  my life 🧠 🧠 🧠 🤓 🤓 🤓
I can’t think of any quipped or clever comments, just, *incredible*
This is the shit we dreamed we could do as kids
This is awesome
I expect a math class in the future to show this video in class for fun.
They animated math bro
I...uh...can't even describe what i just watched...
Orange do be speedrunning math though
That fact that this whole thing started from 1 is insane! Fantastic work bro
Orange probably almost solved world hunger in a couple minutes
Really hope that there’s going to be a second one!
@Derivando un video de esto plis
Now you are just showing off...       *GREAT VIDEO!*
Aleph Being a Giant Titan. If you know, you know.
If maths was more fun
...
Wonder how long the math alone took
The music is so realaxing and the sounds are satisfying….
waiting for the chemistry episode
Keep it up.
Unas persona: Las matemáticas no son geniales ... La matemáticas x Alan Becker:
Our favourite creator is back with more amazingly amazing content!!!!!!!
Dark souls  merge math
Alan proves that' anything can be made into a very epic fight scene if you are creative enough
So now orange has math powers
Love math and your work!
mind-blowing
Ok at the two minute mark my brain malfunctioned.
ok i cant understand anything hes doing lol
math is easy 😊😊😊😊😊
how learn maths:
Omg Nice and Perfect Animation tysm Alan Becker
What
this is a freacking MASTER PIECE!!!!!!
As a math student, I cannot confirm if this is how math works.
This is amazingly done.
Now i understand why Baldy likes math
As someone who loves math, this video is amazing. The animation is awesome, and it shows perfectly why math is a beautiful subject.
You're a genius❤
Pls create game please
I’m glad you made this so know I have a reason to watch these vids in school
Incredible work.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Hey Alan, a video request. You should do animation vs Minecraft dungeons
WOW
This is why I'm now addicted to the calculator app
This shows how complitated and big math really is its so good❤
This is the most creative video on the channel. I was absolutely losing my mind during the whole thing!
WHAT A €5#@ IS HAPPENING!!! HOOO WHAT IS THAT SOUND AT THE FINAL
Meth
μean
This animation is more golden than the ratio
If this video was released when I was a sophomore, I would've had a better understanding of what sin and cos even is.
Buen video 👌   €π= ^°^
i never thought maths could be this epic wat the fuc
1 + 1 is 982725 really
Math power💪🧠
Another epic animation by the man himself, as always.
My brain exploded from so many calculations on the screen 😂
Ah yes math  The final dark souls Boss
This video like Fuels my imagination when I was playing with a calculator in class It satisfies that one part that wanted to something super cool like this Awesome (I'm a math nerd
no entendi nada pero se ve bonito xd
That was too much fun! Now I'm probably going to spend way too much time trying to validate everything in there.
you somehow made math fun
*MATH LORE* 🗣🗣
it GOOD
"Some challenges are harder then others, Just like the challenges we face in life." -Amanda Billing 2018
Math lore at its absolute peakness
damn I didn't know math is that powerful
This to comlicated not enough brain for this.
Hello Alan, I just wanted to tell you that I love your animations and that you have to keep doing them as well as improve, although for me you are incredible and I speak Spanish at the moment I am using Google translator hahaha
MATH!!!!!!!!
After watch this My brain lost connection
this thing need become  a serie
The use of combining elements and symbols takes me back to the original ava
Never thought I'd think math was cool until now, you knocked it out of the park with this one Alan!!
Alan Becker is probably the only one who can make math THIS entertaining.
Alan, how do you do both the animated shorts, AND the next episode for Animator vs. Animation?
Para ir en septimo basico, me perdi en el minuto 3
Yellow would be proud
Imagine an actual math genius reacts to this
Aaaa! I'm learning math! HELP
Continue plz
A great work of art 😮😁👍
Вот бы математика была такой легкой и эпичной
nvm, math is kinda cool now
Bro is the new tony stark💀
Рододтььб❤
7:14 I was understanding everything
i just realized that the second coming manages to make friends with 90% of every enemy he fights. THIS GUY HAS NO ENEMIES
Good video
1+1=57
wow!!! It 's very cool , I wanted to study mathematics
The fact that Alan Becker can create a story with math makes me wonder what else can he do with things that have symbols, like music sheets.
This is how I want to be taught math:
smart
❤❤😢 always the best 😊
When you realize the clash effects are zeros
I think if you and your lead animator were math teachers, I'd be interested in math loads more man. This is entertaining.
The way he be like johnny joestar using those infinite rotations
Imagine if this starts to be shown at schools in the future
Someone needs to show this to a real math teacher to see their reaction damn this episode is goated
I like how Chosen Return is is like "Woah." when he divides by zero.
The sound design in this video was absolutely perfect
OMGGGGGGGGGGG THIS IS AMAZINGGGG Like I have studied most of this  and it was so awesome to watch how he explores maths , and the details man I LOVE IT , how it slowly becomes more and more complex and the introduction of complex numbers man , great job man KEEP IT UP ❤ ❤ ❤
Speaking as a Physics major who actually understands most of what happened here, this was a GLORIOUS experience! 8D So did Second Coming ascend to infinite dimensions? I sure hope there's a sequel to this!!
my brain is broken now
if this was a game I would play it
bro i dont know this type of math
11:19 stikmen go brrrrrrr
My fucking brain
The e's scream is The best part 😅
I love how Alan just speedran every single math course in the history of mankind. PART 2!!!
increadible
Animation vs. Code next? lol
Damm, math lore is crazy
i didn't know math could look so cool
Bro it’s a cannon event
i found a error i=√-1  i^0=1 i^1=i i^2=-1 i^3=-i   then i x i x i = -i  why is "e" if it should be just "-1" answer in english or spanish note: i alan, I am from Argentina (Latinoamerica)
Просто нет слов. Это шедевр.
Alan brother, your animations are very good, very epic, please make a game like this, make a game with war, just like your animations, you are doing very well, please make a game
У меня нет слов, это гениально, я думал что на этом канале найду лишь майнкрафт и экшн-сериал и этого уже хватало из-за их качества, но сейчас вышел этот шедевр, у меня не хватает слов что-бы описать гениальность происходящего на экране, но это превосходно  Автор ты гений❤
The best animation i saw in my life! .. thanks for that!
Brother, even you couldn't leave math over the inscription 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ive somehow learned more from this 14 minute video than 6 years of math class
1+1=2
This guys superpower is math
Bro took the worst thing and made it better
but the real math was the friends we made along the way
Looks like he has to go calculus at this point
math didn't teach me that fast.: Meanwhile, this video you want me to teach you in 14 minutes
Esta potente lo que se fumo el Alan
Solo así me gustan las matemáticas de otra forma no😁😁😁😁😸😸👍👍
Ok I know that e is in a mek  but Orange had to build a Death Star to kill him
A stickman can teach math faster then some people
what a beautiful video!
I visited MIT this week and they have this cool statue donated by an alumni made out of math symbols / notation and I remember wondering which symbol would be the best weapon. I thought integrals would make a great club / staff. Ideas if there's a sequel: Vectors as arrows / spears Matrices as crates / building blocks / castles Tensors as caltrops Turing computers as trains
Absolutely amazing
I want a second animation about that. And please dont forget factorial next time!
wow
Kids about math in school: God, why math is so boring? Why do I need that? Kids about math on alanbecker's videos: I MUST OBTAIN THIS POWER!
POV: you fall asleep on your math textbook
I sure watched this for more than 4 times to understand how you did all this math and animated it, this is beyond a masterpiece.
It’s back😭
I feel like the best feeling throughout this video was being able to understand the math shown
1+1=2❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Cool video aver
After watching this video: what is the life?
Alan just made math look like the coolest thing ever.
Знак равно самый могущественный
The only channel that can make math feel suspenseful.
this shows how powerful math can be
Oh my God I wish calculators were actually this cool, even though I got lost like part way through this video. Cool math tho
10:40 my guy made a satellite laser
Hello
i love how the second coming flips 8 to turn it into infinity, making an atomic blaster. and e screaming at 10:02 was funny as heck.
Literalmente jamás creí que diría esto pero me aburrió un video de ala becker 😂
the math NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow
I have taken a trig class twice so the fact I understood every part of the trigonometry section was wild to me
the circle that second coming use to fire a laser remind me of the death star from star war
I always knew aleph null would come back into my life somehow. Just didnt expect it to also include my favorite animator and animation.
jesus christ if this was how math was taught in schools then maybe i wouldn't be insane right now
I love math in the summer 😂😂😂❤❤❤
Disclaimer: I'm not a math student. I hardly do geometry and I have 0 experience in calculus.  1:39 From euler's identity, -1 is e^i pi (now called euler thingy) 1:50 I guess the idea here is that because i is "imaginary" that it doesn't exist in the real world. 4:56 From euler's formula, euler thingy jumps a pi/4 radian arc in the complex plane by going cos( pi / 4 ) horizontal and sin (pi / 4) vertical. Orange later goes exactly 1 unit vertical in complex plane. 6:00 In polar form, a coordinate is an angle (theta) magnitude (r). Though I guess it's just supposed to represent a circle. 6:38 pi is the length of the circumference (theta=360°) over the radius (r = 1) 6:45 Splitting pi into cos and sin makes no sense to me. 6:51 sin is the vertlcal position of that dot rotating around the circle, and cos the horizontal 7:11 I don't get this lol 7:19 Orange discovers euler thingy again with euler formula this time 7:34 This is one of the many infinite series for e. Each bullet is an iteration of the series. 7:50 h*pi*r^2 is the volume of a cylinder. Note when Orange retracts the cylinder into 1 * pi * r^2 instead of becoming 1 unit in width it becomes 2d. 8:25 Complex definitions for cos/sin *From here on out everything is magic* 8:31 This I need someone to explain for me. And why it makes a laser gun 9:40 Or why the laser gun creates a hole you can escape through... 9:58 Or how the shockwave from the laser gun condenses into the integral symbol... 10:36 Damn I think I need to relearn math 11:42 Laser beam destroys imaginaries... or non-real complex numbers... ? How does that even work... 13:04 The gamma function is generalization of factorials for complex numbers. I still don't know how orange escapes the math world like that though. 13:36 phi is a constant... lowercase delta is for calculus... uppercase zeta is for the riemann-zeta function...  13:47 Big one is aleph, used for different levels of infinity. iirc there are larger infinities
Wait what there's a Hebrew latter at the end. What?
An animation prepared for those who can't do math
i feel like king orange wouldn't know 1+0 after learning both of them
LA PERFEZIONE
quando a professora de portugues é amiga da professora de matematica 3:48
Only Alan and his team could make math so epic
Hi
This is so incredible that my mind goes boom
How to math
10:02 e:Wiiiiiiiiii
Most Basic Math Equation ^
lubie cie oglądać alan
В этой анимации я узнал больше о математике чем в школе
My math professor would now be drown in come.
"The test will be easy" -Math teacher.
Euler's number is a chosen one tier character for sure
This was so worth the wait. I cant explain how good and badass this was
wooow if convert this idea to game 🤯🤯
Mother of aleph null its high quality
Bruh he created mutant sigma 9:48
So you see kids, in order to find the value of “x” you must best it in hand to hand combat.
I focused on this animation more than my entire freshman year of math.
Fascinating. That is the best way I can describe the experience of watching this. Just so... fascinating. You can't look away.
Name the greatest crossover in history. Alan Becker:
Hm, this is rather fascinating.
I never thought math could be so extraordinary
Words can't describe this masterpiece. Numbers can !
В жизни не думал что с помощю математики можнр увидеть такой экшн. Таким образом можно узнать больше смотря бой🤣👍
This is the most mathematical video i've ever seen :0
you already know some math teacher is gonna play this when that one kid asks "how is this gonna be important to us in the future"
I have a theory for this! What if it was a simulation by the "victim" (I don't believe its him) to see how strong TSC was! He's never met him so surely he would want to see what he can do! he made a whole simulation to test TSC so he can find his limits! I'm not sure if this is right or not but it makes the most sense to me! The rest of the color gang weren't there because he doesn't know they exist!
The effects from AVM 30 double 11:09
alan after watch mates mike videos
Not since The Dot and The Line has mathematics been used to tell such a beautiful story.
I love the sound design on this video. I didn’t even know if Scott Buckley was the one behind the music, it sounded so different to his past scores, but it fit perfectly!  It did a great job with the “lonely void” vibe without being too overwhelmingly happy or sad.  I love the typewriter-clicky sounds throughout the whole thing, along with the digital vibe. Different objects and aspects of math have their own feel. I could watch this video without the visuals and remember what TSC is currently learning about! Really feels like you’re trapped in a Khan Academy video, and it’s perfect!
And so this his how you learn calculus
And who knew this could be a way to learn math. Maybe do another one with all the animations in it :D
We need @3blue1brown to do a frame by frame review :D
A video about math got trending in gaming The universe is about to collapse
here is when i would like to know mats
I think tsc just got in while Alan was doing taxes
as a math nerd, this video was beautiful
Please do Animation vs. Zelda Tears of the Kingdom.
el stick man aprendio mas rapido matematicas que yo en 8 años
what in the world is happening here
aqui es cuando me gustaria saber matematicas
I LOVED EVERY SEKINT OF THIS VID I LOVE MATH SO MUSH
Pfff... sos INCREÍBLE!
Dios mio mi cerebro aaaa
This guy needs Oskar 👇Who agreed
An Animation on my Birthday is just amazing
do you speak heabru
And man, I'm seriously want to learn now what that e and i stuff is all about. I always saw it and didn't care for what it means, but now... I'm like how did he do that?
Basics of math looks epic. Why?
when they said math is power. i diddnt think Literally.
nunca aprendí tanta matemática como ahora
E walks so goofy
wow
Now im imagining letters and with each accent or symbol like ! Making obscene words then with different things going into different languages and letter shapes  Can also throw in jokes in how “there,” “their,” and “they’re” all sound the same
The second coming: *Casually breaks the 4th wall of math*
11:41  There is too much attention to detail! Reality cracks up so imaginary numbers start to fall off from cracks.
My God, you're absolutely genius of animation video.🥶
e
Wow good
Fking legend 🔥🔥
I expected orange to just unfreeze from that thing he got tralped in for some reason
this honestly brings me back to those old stickman animations that would focus on some random shit, like Tetris
How to make math fun by Alan becker😂
Why does this video remembered me in every math exam of my life
How is this better at teaching me than all of my math teachers
5 y.o. me when I accidentally turn the calculator  horizontally
Thanks, with this I will know more the math's
"Math n' Algebra: Animation Edition, Starter Pack"
bro made math epic
Euler's identity my beloved
Таким способом намного интересней изучать математику
Bro literally animated the whole world wide 💀
After Watching this I passed my math test! now I can go to Hogwarts😏
why does א appear in the end?  (it's a letter from the herbrew alphabet for those who didn't know)
Lore: TSC was dreaming and that explains why he isn't un alan's PC
It’s been 6 hours and you’ve got 1.6M views. Well done mate 👍
Animations vs. Scratch
holy shit.   HOLY SHIT.
Ladies and gentleman Alan becker: the only person in the world that can make math interesting
It would be funny if he now ends up on cool math games as a joke
Who needs Math teachers if you have Alan Becker
i got to watch an epic animation AND learn math! win win!
omaga increíble
NAAA bro this isnt math this is meth
Baldi's Basics Be Like:
This makes me want to do math
this is just to show you how scary math can be
Who needed years of education and forgetting most of them if alan can just make me remember all of it back in 14 minutes
alan just made me like a math video wtf
Someone should make a game like this
A power of Logic😊
“………………What the hell was that!?” ~ Scott The Woz
This is so incredibly well made. The animation is great  and so clever.
Alan Becker is the sole individual capable of seamlessly transforming a series of logical foundations and variables, governed by precise rules, into formidable weapons, characters, and life-and-death battles. There is no question that your imagination knows no bounds. ∞
Tsc 𝒶𝒹𝓋ℯ𝓃𝒸𝒽𝓊𝓇ℯ𝓈
You gotta love orange becoming a math genius after like five seconds that he learned about it. May we all be like him.
So god
THIS IS THE TECHNIQUE SCHOOLS SHOULD USE TO TEACH...
all my years of learning math has lead up to understanding this video
i think i just learned the theory of math because of tsc
Do a Animation Vs Physics pls
Bro just made an awesome game from the most boring subject of all time     Also alan can you try to make a game out of that video? If you can't that's understandable
S P E E C H L E S S
Man if my teacher teached me math like that i would be invested
es muy buena la profesora me compartio este link porque dice que es casi todo lo que pasa uno cuando estudia con la matematicas :D
I struggle to understand everything after the 7min mark. Can someone proficient in maths explain a bit
Alternative title:how to make math fun
this is why i hate math also this was soo damn awesome to watch
10:36 HE MADE THE DEATH STAR
Ive never seen an Animator so dedicated to making MAth So cool
Who knew mathematics could be so much fun, I still have a hard time looking at the equations and trying to understand them, but hey, great video Alan becker, never change, keep it up 😊😊😊😊😊
amazing
bro found everything
Math win ez
Its kinda surreal, but its pretty neat to watch
This is by far one of the best vids I've ever watched. Outstanding work.
there are not many people that can make math interesting and captivating
me encanto alan becker tiene mucho talento es increible
√i
orange is such a good math teacher
I’m 14. As soon as I get kids that can grasp math, I’m showing them this.❤ Idk how you made this so cool, but I’m all here for it.
bro made friends with math
Incredible concept executed!
Amazing animation as always, but the music was phenomenal!!
How do you even make a math video, THATS ON PAR WITH YOUR OTHER BIG ANIMATIONS
Dont stop makeing these
I never comment on YouTube, but I think this video truly deserves it!!! This is amazing! I’ve always loved mathematics and I love the way that this demonstrates how so many of the operations and constants are interconnected in such a fun way! This has become my favorite video on this website, keep up the good work!
Never would I have thought I would see a stick figure fight math
1:41 1+1=11       #
the better math lesson what i know from my life.
i nutted
I don't think anyone has ever done maths so cool. and the sounds are a delight to the ears. can I ask where they were taken? they're a masterpiece.
He did something my teacher couldn't Now math is actually interesting
Orange progressively learning about math and getting more complicated just as a school curriculum
10:01 be like: WAAAAA. Alan did it again!
this is seriously joggin' the ol' hamster in the brain and reminding me of things
I failed math so this really hurt my brain just watching the numbers fly by…
ok but why did i understand some math stuff here that i haven't understood in school
When I know math I will watch this video again and see if I understand see you in a couple of years guys
I was not prepared for this math class, but I'm glad I came.
just... wow
as a math nerd, this makes me so happy
9:58 So we are dealing with calculus in the argand plane now?
7:35 bro took on the sigma grindset
Next video: Animation Vs Chemisty
I guess math just became a symbol of art.
how did bro go from simple math to Albert Einstein equations
👏👏👏
This animation is more like Animation vs. Euler Identity
If my high school teachers show me this video, they're instantly my favorite teacher
bro made maths epic
❤❤❤Creative work worth 10 out of 10 amazing
lol
everyone hoo wants this to be a full searies like this comment
New video!
A masterpiece like always
Absolutely phenomenal
while i am doing math, i draw this
You know its bad when a stick figure is smarter than you
the one point in life where i actually like math
this is like an alien god trying discovering how human math works
11:28 bro went from discord light mode 💀
as an asian, i fucking love this.
Me in Math Class be like:
Me with 6 years old using the calculator:
Literally the future of teaching math
What level of math even is this!??!? I couldn't even pass algebra 🤣🤣🤣🤣 amazing work my friend as always. Your creativity is unmatched
math at home:
This is brilliant on so many levels, reminded me of high school again.
Ngl, I was kinda hoping that he would use the mobium(this thing♾️) as a motorcycle
😂😂😂 10:02
Wow that was sick!!!
Ngl when the gun got killed by the sword I was like "no oranges bfg!"
How does he come up with this, this is some insane talent
Wtf dude
Taking all those years of math was worth it so I could understand this video.
This made me learn math in another way
They should show this in schools
Terkoiz did an amazing job writing this episode, I wish I had the math experience to properly appreciate the intuitiona and formulas at work. The decision to work with the best of the stickman community really shows in every shot! Kudos to the whole team for making such a unique concept reality.
the e fighting reminds me of clippys fighting in the og saga, many things that feel verry similar to it, i love it
i learned more math in this video then my teachers teaching it
You can always COUNT on Alan to make awesome animations. 😊
the adhd kid learning math
😂MATH is FRIGHTENING.  🙏 Thank you Alan for this amazing piece.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was able to make my cousin study maths thanks to you you made this video just in time cuz she was starting piss me off :D
NO NO DONT BRING ME BACK TO SECONDARY SCHOOL
e^ipi? crazy...
*math* a animator’s worse nightmare
Did i just get lectured on euler's identity
Bro this is the best way to make math fun
1: damn there crew must be MATHMETICIANS.   2: alan… why did you think of this in the first place 😭 were you bored?? (Still a good vid i love it)   3: my brain was dead half the time in the video
thanks for this.
Me going to 6 grade and almost understanding nothing
TSC IS A FREAKING GENIUS
Alan soy chileno pero como hiciste esto cuanto tiempo te costo
como aprender matematicas pt 1
the chosen one:
If Alan would be a math teacher he would be the best one in the world because he described math and made it more fun better than every profesor could do
imagine if this was a playable game
I started getting real excited when they started getting to the radiuses and pi
quiero que @MatesMike me explique esto XD
11:06 bruh done +projectile boost
This was surprisingly entertaining
1+1=amazing animation
This is amazing, it shows an incredible amount of talent. MATH BOSS FIGHT
Math is also my favorite subject 😂
Bro has infinite Iq 🧠
1+1???
It is insanely cool
Who knew math could be used in such a fun way
Quanta criatividade
this guy can turn a stick into the third world war
The nerd inside me is geeking out for this entire video. This is so brilliant!
As someone who loves math I really enjoyed watching this video, using alot of different formula's and kinds of math calculation is cool and very creative to use numbers and math symbols for the weapons during the fight
excellent view
Esse video é uma aula sobre como deixar matemática divertido
This makes math that more epic, more that just lines writin differently
Some of the best 14 minutes I've ever spent watching a video!  Thank you so much!
I wish I could learn math this fast 😔
If Animation vs Minecraft is a full length series then it should be a full length movie lol.
This-is AWESOME!
As a mechanical engineer this is what my nightmares looked like
just wow
Ok thats my favorite video
Learning mathematics with Alan becker
My brain hurt
So this is what goes on inside a calculator
Exploring the universe Math
I need to see Numberphile or Standupmaths react to this...
We really need part 2 pro
Wow
How did bro make math interesting
Increible, de los mejores videos que he visto en youtube en 10 años
wtf it's math
1+1=2  1+1+1=3  1+1+1+1=4  1+1+1+1+1=5  1+1+1+1+1+1=6  1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7  1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=8  1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=9  1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=10  1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+2+2+2+20+20+20+20=100
just watched a stick figure fight maths itself cant complain
That's perfect, really cool Animation
Watch a math tutorial ❌  See Alan Becker ✅
Yeah I might need a series of this
I just finished math so i understand this now lol
Man what a video... I've enjoyed every sec of this🤩🤩🤩
This was really interesting Do think math is my favorite subject but this so cool and interesting
א
Math lore if it were interesting
First of all this episode hurt my brain! Second of all this would make a wicked video game! Much love keep up the fantastic work! ❤
I’m honestly wondering if orange will use this knowledge to make weapons in the future.
one singular complaint: the "the end" screen should have been The||End (|| being concatenate). I'm loving the entire rest of it though~!
Также я который пытается вникнуть
I understood nothing, good video!
3:30 It big brain time
This animation teaches the math it should have been thought at schools, this video is the only reason I appreciate the math classes 😂 just wanted to double like the video 😂
This math kill my baby brain 100x over💀☠
All of your stuff is awesome but your creativity with all these other animation vs projects are on top
My god it's awesome!!!!
Alan Becker just made math Actually fun I'm speechless🎉
This is the best animation ever 🎉
I feel a series is coming
Bro just got more smater than Albert Einstein with 1+1
usually I'm fully aware of the way that audio is used to invoke emotion in the viewer and this has made it difficult to really feel much of anything that modern media tries to press upon the viewer, but, still being aware of it, this is way beyond manipulation because it conveys a truthful beauty. Awesome work and it reignites the feeling of privilege to live at a time like this
HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHH?!?!!?!?!?!?!??
if maths was a game
When you study math but you are interested in animation 😂😁
6h in and we have 1,6M views 💀
Oh see you 1+1= 2 +2=4 😎
most likely, this all happened because the Animation entered the pc's calculator
6 HOURS AGO??
This is the best thing about math i've ever seen in my life
I actually learned more in this video then in my school
He did all this without needing the dreaded “zero divided by zero” joke  Also now SC(Orange) and Yellow should have a calculator battle in some way
Learn math from school ✖️ learn math from Alan's animation✔️
So educative!;-;
I like to think this is one of TSC's dreams while they're in internet jail
e
Now imagine animation vs music theory…
This is the best way to learn math
aşırı iyi olmuş olm keşke  matematik böyle olsa
Mathematicians: he's beginning to believe
Anyone else who looked up "e^iπ" on Google after watching this?
that was epic and strange, you see, praised be alan becker for making animations so epic
I want a episode 2 plsssss
help me.
didnt expect boss fight
For the first time. Orange learns math
YESSS NEW ALANAL BEKER EPSODA
EPIC
epic
bro was fighting Mathe¹Megatron
If this is what math was like in middle / high school then I would have actually bothered with it
Fantastic! So we’ll done!
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLL
what did i just watch lol
This Video will make all Mathematician grateful. It describes maths/numbers and the complexity, and yet it shows the simplicity of it's function. 🤯
POV: when you get bored in math class
NEW VIDEO YES
What??
Math has never been this fun to solve.
Why do i magine there is a secret math club and every math nerd there duking it out with math formula styled like yu-gi-oh playstyle.
Only Alan can make maths interesting
Best math lesson
con esto tengo claro una cosa las matemáticas son increíbles de mi parte eres un gran Youtub sigue así
Only if math was like this
Best math related video I have ever watched
I love how at the end the biggest one was Alif Noel you know all of the natural numbers? Sorry if I missed spelled alif Noel I don’t know how to spell it 😅
와우 꿀잼
Where does this fit in canon? How does Orange end up here?
Learning blender be like:
Who knew math could be so exciting and fun this way, we definetly need a part 2 except with the entire gang doing mathimatics  He doesnt need an oscar, THE OSCAR NEEDS HIM
I felt like such a dumbass watching this video lmao. Everything I learned in highschool has completly left my brain
Can you make a doors stickman video?

alan becker has officially made math look cool. the impossible has become possible.
First: an incredible animation. Second: I'm going to the hospital, I think I've had a stroke.
For those confused, i is used in algebra to represent an imaginary number, since -1 has no real square root. r is a variable that means "radius", the distance from the center to the edge of a circle, and the value of which is used to calculate every aspect of a circle or sphere. π is called "pi" and is paired with r to calculate the aspects of circles. It's often written simplified as 3.14, but really has infinitely many digits. sin, cos, and tan are abbreviations of sine, cosine, and tangent, which are used in trigonometry. θ is called "data" and is a variable used to represent the measurement of an angle. e represents the natural number that I don't know much about yet, just that it's special.  Update (almost 3 years later): Now I'm sitting here in college algebra (above was a less humble high school junior me), remembering this video, and I figured I'd come back and watch it again. Turns out θ is "theta" (a greek letter) and not "data", and e is Euler's constant. I still don't know much about how e is used, nor how i works in exponents. However, through experimentation, I've found that e^i plots a point on the complex plane that is one radian along the unit circle. e^(iπ) is rotated π radians to -1 on the real axis and 0i on the imaginary axis, or simply -1. Some day I might come back and give another update on my learnings of math!
Theory : This is TDL experimenting on TCO while he’s imprisoned
I didn't understand nott a bit of this math, I'm just admiring how epic this is
6:39 "i made you a pie!" "oh boy, what flavor?" "destruction flavor"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
1,500,000th veiw
This is really cool
this is me breaking the math rules.
Epic ✨✨✨
This is so cool and fun (as per usual)
Como hacer las matemáticas divertidas
:0
Now I love matimatics
No jokes coolest fuckin  thing ever😅
Richard watterson calculator game be like:
the timing for me passing my GED math test today and this coming out is hilarious
math
I literally thought this came out like 4 years ago until I literally found it came out 5 hours ago. Thank you alan.
HOW DID YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS MATH STUFF AND WHAT DOES e^iπ MEAN?
I really liked the suspense it gives and the creativity of using mathematical numbers as weapons etc. I never thought I would see a mathematical stickman XD.
This is why you are the GOAT!
nice visuals about what each equation does. I will still hate math.
My brain its... its just stopped working. I guess
Math on drugs
This is good
Надо было назвать не "Анимация против математики", а "Второе пришествие против математики "
be a math teacher plessssa
what was the huge symbol at the end?
so this is what goes on in my calculator.
1:30 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Это гениально!! 🔥
the animation is amazing!
that was cool
me 30 minutes before the math test:
Sometimes the videos just make you question reality
Its cool how someone who doesn’t like math, but has seen almost everything and understands all the process that appear in this video, could actually fully enjoy this video Amazing
this is so clever!
Bro learned every single math lesson so he can make an animation
I just graduated leave me alone I never want to see number again AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"The real genius of the animations is not real" the real genius of the animations:
I got Tron vibes from this, awesome video as always, Animation versus is a series I'll never get tired of watching
What I imagined in my head during math😂😂
best math animation
That was the most beautiful concept for an animation I have ever seen in my life. You really are an animation genius. Be totally proud about what you can do and who you are!
I loved this and hope for a sequel!
1+1=2
Wow! Alan, it was so amazing! Respect👏👏👏👍
thank you so much for making math entertaining
How did the second coming come over in that world?
?
This is math lore
Teacher: The test wont be that hard *The test:*
I came here thinking this video came out 6 years ago but no it was only 6 hours. I’m sure I could say plenty that others have said but it’s so good to see fun and creative animations like this still existing on YouTube after all these years and all the hassles on YouTube. No Ads, No Sponsors, No Patreon no Merch Plugins, just the art of animation in its purest form. Incredible work, keep it up.
Where’d you get this calculator?
4:41 no se porque pense en el exorcista xd / idk why i think in the exorcist lol

" The real genius is not real", the real genius:
The way orange learns so fast💀
Amazing
I want a part 2 plss
Now this is Math
aleph null!
1+1=
Its cool that I know majority of this math
suddenly everyone is interested in maths
new series?!?
Wth man I just did math homework till 2am
Already love math and animations but this brings it to a whole other level of it
damn
Wow
Жаль что я половины не понял
Жаль что я половины не понял
I don't understand much of the ending, but I love the detail that ℵ is walking in the background, seemingly infinite (because it is)
i know the first one 1+1 = 2 :D (don't talk about the others PLSSSS)
Аж сердце замирает
Part 2
I love the sound design in this animation.
Алан ты грёбаный гений что смог придумать такую концепцию И когда ты её так хорошо Реализовал я еще больше утверждаюсь что ты гений
This is something Nolan would love to see
This man deserves an oscar
This should be a vr game.
made this w physics it will be so cool
Пов хочешь обмануть калькулятор
i give a second chance to cupid XD 5:10
Absolutely beautiful is the best way i can describe this. This goes beyond anything i've seen before.
Is this the "Calculator" game I've heard so much about?
Seeing him simplify complex (to me) equations melts my brain.
Mathal combat
i did not like math and how it was trying to understand it, but this? this is a more fun way of seeing things
Ja to niewiedałem  że to takie obliczenia
AVM, but not minecraft, it stands for animation vs math now
yay
POV: My brain during math class 10:10
People be like “i wish math lessons were like this” bro it is like this, I don’t know why everyone thinks math is harder than shit like history, because I can figure out how to simplify an equation if I’m locked in a room because I can figure it out based on past info, but I can’t remember who farted at 11:36 pm December 2nd 1763. You don’t have to remember shit in math if you know the basics because it’s all the same shit
🤓 while watching this *takes the popcorn out*
We just need to know if this is just a "Non-Canon Video" or if this is actually canon.
If I had to be %100 honest about this episode, this could be my least favorite episode so far. In my opinion only seeing TSC is weird since Yellow should atleast be included since he is smarter. Although I really liked the animation, I'll give it that
I believe I am now inspired to become more of a math nerd after watching this
This is what Richard was playing, no?
Pov staryed lights at the end:
you made math cool But what happened to orange?
The א at the end had me giggling
please make animation vs software
Can someone please tell me what those giant “numbers” were in the background at the end, or at least what they represent, I am very confused and very scared
7:00  Θ/r =π ? . Overall is a great video.
¡es una obra de arte!, muy buen trabajo.   Solo pude llegar a entender desde el inicio hasta la circunferencia, después de ahí todo era ecuaciones que dan miedo 😵‍💫, pero de verdad, excelente trabajo Alan, ¡espero que sigas asi y mucho más!
ESTA ANIMACION ME DESTRULLO EL CRANEO
I wish Alan can make Animation vs. Totally Accurate Battle Simulator
I'ma use this video to beat up my math teacher
Math? Why not
bro can we get this video for kids in first grade to revamp the school system
Only if teachers teached this way.
This is God's message for me to actually get to work on my Summer Algebraic Practice. I hate it, but one day... Still a math lover.
My last brain cell during mathematic exam:
Asian brain is wiggling
This video suggests that mathematics opens doors for you
Looks like The Second Coming found his way into Alan's calculator
This is what all of my algebra classes feel like.  And yes, the villain is always Euler
The + End = Theend  Lol stay frosty!
As someone who was really good at math back in high school, this tickled my brain in a really nice way!
This melodie is so... Beautiful!
I didn't though that math would be that interesting..
Ooo alan bu gerçekten büyük bir başarı seni bütün dünya taktir ediyor emin ol...
Beautiful
This video made me realise that  x÷0=∞
That were the best 14 minutes of my life :D
Alan merged math concepts with animation so well... Definitely one my favourite❤❤
Naranja aprendió más rápido que mis 9 años de estudio D:    (9 años porque todavia estoy estudiando)
1+1=2 & -1+-1=-2
goddd q buena animacion
If we’re going into school subjects now how soon until a Animation vs cellular biology 😂
Я в шоке. Он сделал из математики полноценный сюжет, отношения героев, экшен и тд. Я вахуи 😦
He really made an animation to explain why e^iπ = -1
Who ever did the in between's needs a rase holy.
guys can anyone pls take out time and explain me all the fight scenes. i understood only 1/4 of the video.
if you bring green and yellow in there they would go ham and go way further than this, further than orange.
10:00 WAAAAAAA XD
1+.1=7
Orange is the Mathslayer
Bro taught me more about math then I'm learning in school rn. Moral of the story: Everytime you do math, its two or more things battling against eachother. One of my new favs ^^
Hi alan you do amazing animations! I wish I could animate like you!
NO NO  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO  NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NOT ANOTHER ONE
1+1 = 11
Someone should actually make a game out of it
The fact I hate math and suck at it, and I'm watching this for a second time, should tell you how much I love this
Hermoso
Quick Maths!
this is THE BEST animation i have seen
Bruh literally stick man smarter than me hahahaha
все уроки математики алгебры и геометрии из школы в одном видео
Wait until they figure out inaccessible cardinals
Pov: you get bored in math class
to be honest im too dumb for this animation, but its still fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I don’t get it
Not only was this Animation fantastic, the audio was just out of this world good!  Well done, Alan...And that is an UNDERSTATEMENT!!!
How do you make math, FUN to watch
Pre-K-12th in a nutshell
It start with One ...
is this what people good in math see?
This is so cool
Absolutely STUNNING!
Alans calculator: (._ . "
In summary : Orange finds meth. Orange harasses meth. Meth defends itself. Orange attacks meth. Orange saves meth. Meth forgives Orange. Meth helps Orange. Meth is a good meth. Be like meth.
I like math now.
POV lekcja matmy kiedy mnie nie ma w szkole
thats why i hate math
Now waiting for Animation vs. Physics...
And I thought I was good at maths 😂😂😂
best animator forever.
боже это вилеколепно, сколько трудов было вложено в этот шидевр
Awesome work! Didn't expect this type of video but I love it lol, keep it up! :)
you should make a part two where you should do mc ^2
now i want math smash bros
Ahora esta es mi nueva clase de inglés con acción y maravilla
i don’t understand like half of it, but it’s making me want to…
I don't understand what the heck happened, i just care about the animation bro, like... 💀
I think this is where TSC was before Alan created him
People who are true mathemetics when they realize how to make a weapon better than a atomic bomb 10:30
The death star
It's awesome! Thanks!
THIS VIDEO IS FIRE BRO🔥🔥🔥If it were video game it will be super cool tho. btw Love your work tho
genuinely curious as to how much of this makes any sense and how much of it is just because it looks cool; cause theres absolutely no chance id know how did the second coming even get into this situation
As a lover of math i will spend the rest of my life studying it to get all of the references of this video.
The + end 🤣
Everyone in math class be like
Epic
Он из математики сделал экшен анимацию с разнообразной, интересной боёвкой. Я в шоке
Wow
2+2=?😂😂
moral of the story: Maths are evil, do meth instead
I wish this was how math actually work
there shouldn't be a single person on the planet who isn't subscribed to you Alan
WOAH THIS IS AWESOME
When I thought of a horizontal number line, I thought that if it were to be vertical it would show imaginery numbers. I thought of this on my own in sixth grade, and it's been proven to be true, according to the video...
I love that TSC can just exist in a void without any of the other sticks and no one questions it.
Bro, you’re making my brain hurt from all this MATH like who do you think is going to understand all of this💀
making this was probably one of the most frustrating thing in the world i feel bad.
Amazing work
I Watch the video and the maths is awesome and excellent
Great video! Having a story, music, sound design and just some fun all around is a great way to show these mathematical ideas and notation. And to spark interest in how these concepts really work. So this is actually a very good math video! 👍🏼  In the animation I particullarly liked how there were many zooms, but you never felt lost. You always got a good feel for the scale of things. 👌🏼
was the + end a ratio?
As a total math nerd since elementary school this video made me absolutely lose it on several occasions. This is such a fascinating idea and I love everything he’s done with this. The creativity is insane!➕🟰
What would happen if they did 0 / 0 Will it destroy math?
charming
Pls new episode i love math
Истинная сила математикм
This is crazyy
ojala el profe de matematicas dejara ver este video e n clases  XD-
I never found mathematics so interesting 😂😂
Yay AvM oh wait..
Magic Math 5%:
How does this video animators brain work
listen, I  HATE  math, I don't even bother showing up to math tests, but this is COOL.
Yoo it's to cool and weapon with math numbers and simbouls is cool to look and cool with animated. I think it be part 2 but no it's be this math animation
kind of content youtube need, the world need this.
:) did I see a new video
They need to make math lessons like this.
0:59 The fact that TSC is so used to the other sticks being there and discovering things with him that their absence is made so jarring is painful  When he celebrated the new discovery, and no one was around to be excited with him?  Major ouchies from me.
@_@
13:44 I love how Aleph is huge
2:48 Alan just show us how scary anything divided by Zero is
Why it’s not Yellow who is in this dimension?
When I finally decide to use math in the real world:
how teachers think we will be using math in the future
Não tenho nada pra falar só isso deixou eu de boca aberta isso simplesmente é incrível e mais muuuuuuuuiiiiittooooooo criativo!         Pfv like like like👍👍
This is what teachers expect when they ask you to show your work
My math teacher: math is very easy kids Mathematics:._.
math no longer makes sense
Bfb x Ava collab?????
Simplemente wow
THIS WAS AMAZING
It only did he turn regular Stickman so interesting he also managed to make math of all things exciting
אאא ממה
8:50 FIRST GUN USED BY ORANGE?!?!
TSC has something to befriends with things that seems want to destroy him
PLEASE MAKE MORE THAT WAS FIRE!!!!
Wow orange is better than me at math 😢
i was lost at 1+1
Thanks to this I understand more about math
What if yellow was there
Wow. Just WOW! And the cool thing about it ... The things in the video are right. My math teacher is retiring. Now I know what to show him as the final video.
now i want a game completely revolving around math. god damnit
I love your animations when is next anamator v animation still your the best anamatoir
Me watching the ai figure out calc 2
Dang orange is have 1000 IQ I only have -10 IQ
All my years studying in school to be able to understand an animation, it's amazing :D
Friend: Hey how hard was the math final  The final:
…i want to know more. PLEASE MAKE A PART 2
Where are the characters?
hes beginning to believe
now Orange go in physics dimension
This is similar to what math problems look like in my head, yet it gets way more complex.
I've never clicked on something so fast in my life.
This is what taking a math test is like.
Why was stickman trying to get “e”anyway
Alan trying to do his math homework
It's proven. I still hate math, but I still love Alan.
I... I... I-I.... MATH.
what a perfect animation
No tengo la menor idea sobre matemáticas, pero creo que entendí más este video que mis propias clases de matemáticas. :)
미쳤다 진짜 수학 밈 봤었는데 이게 여기까지 왔네
you blow my mind to the ², here is your like good man.
I'm speechless for the quality of it all. Alan is amazing... it's a very high level of creativity and skill that only he can offer
TSC is litelarly breaking the 4th wall imo
This concept could actually make a really good game
I told my friends that math was fun
3:06 bro discovered the matrix💀  10:57 HE MADE THE DEATH STAR☠
I think I just got a degree in math
Conituned
İt's amazing
IDK how ya'll did this but, i wish this video was out years ago cause then I'll love math as a child XD
I don’t know none of this
Fantastic, still Math is my least favorite
Even tho I hate math this video amaze me
Новый сериал?
I thought this was animator vs animation VI episode 2 but oh well this video was still as good as the rest
I love it ❤❤❤
didn't know math could be so epic
He really needs to learn matesha
Aqui es donde comprendo que el mundo de matematicas, es un mundo de locos, me encanta
6 FUCKING HOURS AND 190.000 LIKESE, HOLY SMOKES. You deserve it!
POV Alan accidentally opens his calculator
Beautiful 👌
Eduardo Sáenz TIENE que reaccionar esto*-*
Only Alan Becker could make math entertaining
Après toutes les animations incroyable que tu as fait, c’est ma préférée
Bro my brain actually hurt after this
Now, after watching this episode from the stickman universe, I realized that mathematics is the most difficult science, since it can be divided into different types of subjects for studying in schools. Endless mathematics or arithmetic, together with geometry and algebra, combine one of the most difficult sciences to study as a whole - Mathematics
I sincerely think education must take inspiration from this. This is outstanding how some concepts are shown
Ждём "стикмены против физики и химии
4:40 this gives me nostalgic vibes since it reminds me of animation vs animator 3, he fought a paperclip and this just reminds me of that part
Is it me or do I feel smarter?
What also would have been a good ending is orange waking up in blues math lesson
I'm so ready for college man.
This is clean movement tbh
Am I the only one who cross-checked the functions to understand it's damage level 😂
the author is a genius
i never knew math could be so fun
Where does TSC go after?? The portal could lead back to his universe but idk how that works, nice job though
I am so confused
you've been doing this for seven years
POV: Your nerd friend be like

This made my brain hurt, but was so awesome to see  You guys are real geniuses coming up with all this stuff!
5:34 HE DREW A PERFECT CIRCLE
Es hermoso maravilloso me encantó más allá de los límites matemáticos XD  Es hermoso creo que boi a llorar XD   Hermosa animación bro te quedó espectacular me fascino✨  Démosle like a esta maravilla de animación 👍
Everyone's true enemy: Math
This would be an awesome way to learn math cause then I’d actually care😂  This is going down as one of my most favorite animations from Allen😎
this is the best video to ever exist ever
That's cleverest video I've seen in a long time. Saw it on Reddit and wanted to give a thumb here. Every moment is cool on is own. Nicely done 👍
The music is so good. It describes math as such a mysterious but powerful force found everywhere able to create anything. I really love this video. Props to you and the team and the dude which nailed it with the music lol.
If I pulled orange/TSC out of the screen, would he be tiny?
So thats how he got so much iq  in building
I guess learning math really did teach me to appreciate numbers
Imagine if we learn math this way Math would be fun
TSC has beef with every thing possible
Animations vs. Physics? Please make it happen! Great video as always!
The whole math program in 14 minutes
Math is okay. So what about physics? I know orange never survive that.
I'm gonna ask my math teacher to play this in school
didn’t know math could be this epic
wait wouldn't this mean this mean that the orange stick figure is infinite he's at least running at infinite speeds he caught up to pi if I'm wrong someone explain that's what I got from it but I'm not a math wiz so I could be completely wrong about it
🔥
A need more like this
alright who else watched the whole episode till the end?  👇
Waltuh
turning something boring into something epic
I thought it was gonna be ep2 of AvA lol😂😂
After this video I will never want to do math again
This orange stickman learned from the basics of math to using infinity to his advantage in like 10 minutes or less and here we are taking years to go from + and - to × and ÷.
waiting for a math nerd to explain all the references
Ooommmgg.. This a osm video.. 😮😍... Appreciated for your lot of hard work Alan.. 👏 👏
this is the most engaging math video i've ever seen. leave it to the alan becker team to keep me interested in the 14 minute math video
My 5year old brain learning math for the first time
I had absolutely no idea what the formulas were halfway through the video, but my mind was blown into the stratosphere. You are one incredibly talented artist alan, you really are!  - A 12 year old.
When you know what is 2+2
I might go start studying some math thanks to this animaton, 🤔🤨
This one sparks joy Normal math: this one does not spark joy
is there a - end?
If math were like that in the video then I would be better at math who doesn't even feel like fighting numbers
12 senelik matemetigin 15 dk da ozeti kxnsksdnms
this just blow my mind
Remember kids, if you do your math, then you will be able to defeat the terrible e
E should Def join in to the chosen ones universe
that blew my mind how he turns a + into all this
thats fire!!!
Вот и начинается новая эра…. Анимация против математики
Bro made math million times cooler
And people say you cant have fun with math  WELL THEN EXPLAINE THIS! >:)  CHECKMATE NON MATH LIKERS
This is da first time i see math interesting
It’s summer, Alan.
one of the good merge games lol
R-0eiπ=r+0 (7:54) how to solve xd
Siempre espero mucho de ti y siempre superas mis espectativas ❤❤❤❤
NOBODY SAID THERE WOULD BE MATH!!!1!
Einstein would be proud of this Masterpeace of a Animation
Woah, I don't know how you came up with this, but it's great and cool
I appreciate how you were able to visualize _why_ dividing by zero is impossible instead of just having that cause some kind of cosmic BSOD.
congratulations, that was very creative
As always, another FANTASTIC episode.  Literally every math nerd has to be gushing about this.  The fact that I've only ever gotten through (because we only went as far as) algebra and geometry in high school, yet still got a fair portion of the basic concepts in this is thanks to Alan and company's gifts.  You guys have serious talent when it comes to getting ideas across mostly without ever using words.  Then again, I guess animating literal silent stick figures for the better part of ten or so years will force you to develop those communication skills.   Also chiming in as others have, the sound design for everything you're doing is absolutely amazing.  It never ceases to amaze me that even though the characters never speak, the set and background design, their actions, and the music and background sounds TOTALLY do the heavy lifting to get your points across. Seriously hoping this can be parleyed into a big moneymaker for everyone involved in these animations someday. You've earned it.  And even if not, it has to be gratifying to know you have a pretty huge fanbase who loves the things you've created.
Ala, que hermoso fue eso
All of this comes from......... 1.
Omg
This was more educational than the public school system
Thanks for this.  Very inventive and compelling.
This took will i use math in real life to a new level
The power of this mind is inf
This, just, the maths, i understand most of it, and it makes me both satisfied, and unreasonably upset for some reason. The maths work, its all correct. And yet, seeing numbers applied in such a way, affecting reality in a literal and imaginary way. Makes me hope magic systems dont become math based
This really deserves an Oscar!
Bro taught me more than my math teacher in 1 year
Here we go
training ark
My head hurts
Learning math with the Orange Stickman! I feel like I need this...
people who know math: PERFECTION
Made me wanna learn math
is there something this guy can not animate?😆
What the F*** is with the number i, it must be the weirdest number
This was actually bad ass🔥🔥🔥
wow
Someday I thought that I would make a film on Math's functions. where like integrations are raining from the sky and math folks living on the earth would try to save the people from evil math by solving those problems etc... but this video made me think about the creativity of yours like You proved that Math is a god, when I read IS GOD A MATHEMATICIAN by Benjamin Franklin, this video is absolutely giving me that vibe. If I were to pay Millions of dollars to watch your math videos I would pay.
Hey Alan can you make a white character we got some of all colors but I would love to see a white character
This video taught me more than my math teacher.
Пов:решил сыграть в калькулятор
Когда выключили интернет:
Świetny film czekam na więcej :)
teachers, you gotta take notes
They finally made math cool.
they should make a video game that’s literally the main character fighting math while learning it
NOOOOO
Dude. As a Math Nerd. That was one of my absolute favorites of yours. Amazing video and hilarious ideas.
I wish math was like this.
Would be seeing anymore AvM videos?
2+2=4
I astonished with the fact that math represented very accurately! Beautiful!!
Let’s be clear guys, Orange is fighting racism😂
Now i know why cant ÷ 0
Alan cool animation came out I even liked it great keep up the good work
13:20 what is he going is he going to home?
Ah yes numbers that make no sense but they make cool contraptions. 😀
That fight was very irrational
wait, if there was a part 2 about this, the side of the story for the character, then so much backstory would make sense and you would be able to do so much with it
Professors should start teaching math like this  Win win for everybody
Wow that is so op
math teachers should put this in class
How did you do legendary videos like this
I actaully surpassed this level of math 2 months ago
Someday there is gonna be something like an Avengers version of AvA where Alan, Minecraft Mob, The Original The Chosen One, and these math character make an appearance and fight something big
Alan and Alan’s team is the only person that could make numbers fight while making it look cool and make sense
I really hope it's mathematically correct , if so this shows he is a genius in entertaining me with math that is accurate. I am bewildered
Can someone explain to me what happened at the end???
It like a movie name tron legacy
Me quito el sombrero nunca creí que las matemáticas fueran tan increíbles Brillant 👏👏👏👏
😯😮🤯
Math is easy and fun, right?
a forma que ele usa a matemática é tão divertido. mas ele me mostrou umas coisas super avançada da matemática que eu nunca vou saber.
Probably the most joy I’ve had with math ever
Math is universal
This video makes math look epic
Pls part 2😢
I cannot believe that I just watched a stickfigure play with algebra. The internet is amazing
is it weird that i got excited when the calculus terms showed up
This makes be believe that all this is = to 0 from every attack.
oh no euler is at it again
I learned all my math from this one video
Great video alan you are my favorite youtuber
E
This whole time I just thought that SC somehow got stuck in the calculator app
Man, this animation looks like einstein made it, it looks so smart and futuristical!
i know all up to i
This was so cool!!
my son would love this indeed
This has made me understand math more than ever.
I love it how he basically made a death star out of a circle
Вывод:учите матиматику
While watching this all I could think about was:  Wow, this could make a great game…
Alan showed that mathematics and animation are one big invention without limits.
damn, this was sick!
Math is my favorite subject, I ace all tests... My Grandfather used to be a Math teacher
no way an e has a voice line
this looks REALLY COOL!
the infinity symbol (forgor what it was called) looming in the background
Alan is such a genius and decided to do math animation and started showing how smart he is
The hardest fight the stickmans had ever.
Ojala las mates fueran asi
Alan showed that mathematics and animation are one big invention without limits.
Knowing the math makes this video so much better
Вывод:учите английский
What did I just watch?!
эпично
What is the big thing moving at 13:47 if you squint your eyes in the direction of the symbols going?
5 HOURS AGO-
What is the big thing moving at 13:47 if you squint your eyes in the direction of the symbols going?
Very creative!
One of the only people who can make an animation about math and we will find it interesting is Alan! Also, 4:42 orange holding a crucifix
That was the best video of yours and I have seen all of them, mind blowing wow!!! Keep the good work
Caramba esse foi brabo
A math video thats actually entertaining?! *This is ground breaking..*
I didn't know that you can make a deathstar using math.
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 I DID NOT KNOW MATH COULD BE weapons!!!!!
This both isn't and is for everyone at the same time
I can’t watch a stick figure do math without there being an awesome fight
Someone: Impossible to make animation out of math  Alan:
Keep doing your animtions, it's the best!!!!
Calculated
Bro i learned so much from this thanks alan
rePers
this is genius, and i m glad im here to see it
This may have been the strangest of all of Alan’s animations yet somehow one of the coolest
Math has it's own magic  This guy has just proven this
Wanna teach math? Play this video
Someday when I will know math better, I will rewatch this video.
1.4Million a views in 5hrs insane.
Next video: animation vs programist
Help I don't speak math, i don't understand, anyone can translate for me?
That was beautiful, again, everything works in this animation. The connection between conceptual mathematical laws of the universe and amusing fight action makes it one of the best animations ever made by you and your team. This is just… beautiful, even for a man, who don’t understand much in the math. I wonder how it would be like in a Dictionary…
Pog
Me trying to do math homrwork:
ONLY ANIMATION COULD MAKE MATH THIS F*****ING COOL WTF
I'm speechless 🫡
my man dropped the hardest math edit🔥
Bro made a whole death star with just math🗿
Now it's time for everybody's favorite subject:MATH!
Literal estuve pausando el vídeo viendo cada operación y quedando  fascinado
I love your videos and math ❤.
1
Orange would be a fun teacher
i gues you can say “He just broke the equation”
imagine this is canon
Bro forgot to skip maths classes
Can someone please make this into a video game that actually teaches mathmatical constructs? Thank you
My grades in mathe before watching this: C. My grades after: A+
Это просто нечто!!! Ещё одно невероятное видео с классным сюжетом
wow❤❤❤ simply amazing alan becker!
This video actually made me understand math on a better level.
bro it’s so cool how the stick figure is learning more advanced math to use against e^i π
Lesson of math.
This is deeper than number lore
Dude Alan is way too intelligent for a Stickman animator
Como siempre una joyita impresionante
Achievement: QUICK MATHS
you know they are pissed when animation's going into the 3rd dimension
I barely undestand a thing im on 6th grade
This needs to be in every Math Class in every school 🔥👑
i hope next time they kill math for good
If Alan Becker is math teacher:
Wow!!! Amazing
next: animation vs scratch (the coding engine ofc)
The amount of dedication of math on this is amazing.   Then add a quality animation fight WITH MATH!? Thats beyond amazing, thats astonishing.   This make me want to learn more about math lol
I hope one day we can use math like that instead doing simple 2D writing
I understood everything until i just didnt
This is what math teachers should show in schools
My brain hurts
Is it just me but idk what's happening in the video
Only Alan can make math seem cool
It’s amazing to see how much you have progressed throughout the years as an animator. From stick figure animations to freaking anime! You truly inspire me! I can’t wait to see what’s coming in the future.😁❤
sc is so smart
Alan is the kind of guy that would make a fucking ATOM amazing
imagine a game like this, it would be amazing
Me and my stupid mind does not understand this at allll
i think this is the most creative animation i have ever seen from alan and its absolute the most awesome thing ever. great job alan!
So satisfying........
Why they teach us Math not with something like this, then were math not absolute Boring instead it was at least a little more fun this way
Orange should've gotten powers
Congrats Alan Becker, you manage to make something I never thought was possible, you made math interesting! Give this man a medal!
I never new you could make math this interesting
Maybe the real math was the friends we made along the way
You just made math look fun! Great job!
*m e t h*
I wonder what this video would have looked like if it was made long ago 🤔
I'm gonna learn a lot of math then rewatch this
this is the kinda shit i had in my mind when i was bored in maths class
crazy talent
The depiction of powers of 2, 3, 4 and 5 was incredible!!  I've never been able to picture something like a... is it called a hypercube?
If it is a + ending this implies that there was a standard ending. That is not the weirdest thing which happened in this video. Many concepts were completely unfamiliar.
Now do "Animation vs. Code"
Why wasn't I thought math like this
Naw he just entered Alan's calculator
Also that was the most epic thing i've ever seen
i LOVE math
part 2 pls
Perfect Animation
I never thought I would see an epic action video about math I LOVE IIIIIIT thank you Alan and thank you LEAD ANIMATOR.
nao entendi mas achei legal
The smart people understanding everything me just enjoy alans video
This is simply incredible
1+1= is 2
The old era of stickman vs Minecraft is over, the new era of stickman vs math is born
For once, math is cool
This animation was as breathtaking as all the others ^^ The only reason tho, I couldn't enjoy it really much was the lack of motivation behind all this or rather a reason.  Like with the virus, there was a reason, why it was on Alans PC etc. but why was the orange stick figure in this math world? How did it get there? I really hope we will get an answer to this in the future ^^
As a math enthusiast, I'm proud to say that I had been smiling like a doofus every time I saw a reference I knew.
ah yes Math lore
This makes me want to go to school
I'm actually learning math by watching this video (in the funniest way possible)
The number 1: *descends over sentient AI*  TSC is the singularity confirmed
So this is why I need to pay attention i math class
I really expected Orange to pop out of the calculator app on Alan's PC at the end xD  But maybe that would make it less of stand alone story
The animation was incredibly satisfying to watch holy... xD
Part 2 plis is epic
animation vs. physics😅
Never in my life have i ever been THIS interested in math.
This would make a great vr fighting game
Bro made math interesting
all jokes aside but this a complete MASTERPIECE
If I finish the minecraft vs animation series why don't they create geometry dash vs animation
t's pretty intuitive, even with the action scenes.
congrats you teaches students with math and also made a fun animation
I feel bad for Alan. He had to do this much math just for a video of our sake.
Our figure fighting the harvest
This video perfectly depicts every students struggle against the demon we call mathematics
We makin the exam with this one 🔥
asian saala
Me during every math test I have participated in
1+1=2
Orange vs eiπ is literally my brain vs a maths test
i'm not intelligent enough for understand this, anyways good video
Wish we had this much fun with math in our schools because I would go to school everyday just for this 😢😂
This type of math probably had albert einstein scratching his head!
Why can’t my school just do this?
OMG I wish we were taught like this...
Finally, humanity's greatest opponent, math
I gained 5 more neurons in this video
*THE FREAKING MATH BLASTER*
Just imagine Neil Degrasse Tyson  narrating this
Wow
This is the best video I have ever seen in my entire life. Amazing
XD this Animation is the definition of 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓  but its still a banger
This was insanely cool
Wow
As a college student this both amazed me and terrified me over the recent classes I took.
This is ridiculous
Okay this is the best and my most favourite episode so far
Animation vs. Baldi's Basics
I never thought math could look this cool
How we all wished math class was like:
They have to make us watch this video in math class
The weirdest video on the entire channel
I would actually pay attention in class if this was the lesson
oh crap my brain is boom ıdk my mat realy bad my brain not agilatbly                   and.....                                                                                                                                                I AM SEEK
bro TSC learn half of the entirely of math in under 15 minutes while im right here still trying real hard to figure out wtf is a kilometer
Это надо смотреть в максимальном замедлении, чтобы хоть что-то понять
They lost me at quadratics
So this is what people with math as there hobby see in their  calculators. Very interesting! :)  Part of me really want an calculator with a drag an drop system.
Alan casually dropping another masterpiece 😊
Man it's been 6 months since I ended school and I swear to God I didn't understand a thing even tho I remember seeing all of this ._.
Ngl that was pretty cool
*_ALEPH_*                                       6/24/23
this looks just like a calculus tutorial to me
this is the nerdiest video ive ever seen
Xit🤣🤣🤣🤣
As someone who doesn't know how to divide, I find it difficult to understand the video.
aleph is barely visible at the end man almost didn't see him.
This guy somehow managed to make math more interesting than what 12 years of education could, and that deserves some respect!
If only real-life math homework was this epic. I would love to have a 2 x 2 = GUN moment like this.
Bro just explained whole math lore in under 15 minutes
Hi😂
Don’t open the calculator app
Mercenariesvsskibidi toilet
Buen video, "Ñ"
Imagine if Alan made an educational channel, kinda like Hank and John Green but through his animations
por que matemtica por que
I learnt some pretty new things from this.
IMPRESIONANTE ❤
Learning the powers of agent smith
Animation vs roblox slap battles
0 ÷ 0 = *Black Hole*
dude is using math to beat math
i live for ur animations and its cool to see orange(the choosen one mk2) learn math in like 30 sec! and its cool to see that he uses math to fight AND (my last and dont worry) its cool that there is fighting in most animations!
Today i learned a lot of new upper classes maths and it was really confusing 😅
Wait, so what happened to TSC? Anyways, this looks epic.
This video is me when i was young trying to figure out what everything did on a calculator
SECOND COMING IS THE BEST MATH TEACHER!!
This youtuber is on another level.
*Me thinking math in my brain*
orange calculatings for cydjdbeuheyilelgekgufeig cgalcytal math
Awesome animation bro❤️❤️
If math was an anime
I never thought I would watch a video about math that doesn't bore me...
The scream had me sobbing 9:55
I remember learning a lot of that in collage
What would have been nice would have been to unite the exponential (e) with the natural logarithm ln() because ln(e^1)=1   I think this could be the subject of a second episode.  Otherwise, I think this animation is absolutely brilliant. I'm passionate about math, so this was an animation that could only appeal to me. I really like the fact that at the beginning there are only simple calculations (addition / subtraction / multiplication / division) and then there are literal numbers (n), exponentials (e), graphs, complex numbers (i), lowercase and uppercase sigmas (σ / Σ), some lowercase pi (π), infinities (+∞), an integral (∫), functions (cosine cos() / sine (sin() / tangent tan()), a lowercase theta (θ), square roots (√), factorials (! ), powers (²), the set of real numbers (ℝ), linear span span(), sets {x1 / x2 / x3}, decimal logarithm log(), limits lim x → 81, derivatives (dt), capital Tau (but I have a doubt about it) (τ), uppercase Phi (Φ), lowercase Zeta (ζ) lowercase Delta (δ), and a game with the radius of a circle (r) with notions of radians (rad) and angles with references to volumes and vectors (←) !  Great animation !
i know no math This video was amazing the animation is crazy good <3
if this was the math, I would be starting a world war 205
I love how the math slowly gets more and more advanced as the video goes on
Imagínate que julio profe, o el profe alex lo explique, esto si es locura 😅
If maths were like this, I wouldn’t sleep in the middle of the class
Imagínate que julio profe, o el profe alex lo explique, esto si es locura 😅
I swear this was my nightmares in high school 😂
This is peak educational entertainment.
epic
Alan can make anything fun even math
This was amazing please make a part 2!!!!!! :)❤❤❤😀😀😀🥳🥳🥳😁😁😁😄😄
This is so nerdy I love it
Imagínate que julio profe, o el profe alex lo explique, esto si es locura 😅
Im telling u this has something to do with the AvA 6 plot.
This is a masterpiece and I have been looking at it for 5 hours now
א
Bro took basic math to a whole new level 😳😳😳
Me trying to finish my math exam:
my brain hurts
doodling in class be like
Aprendiendo matemáticas con alan
I'm guessing Orange somehow got stuck in the calculator on Alan's computer.
The best animation ever made👍🏻
That was so cool 🥺 🌟
maths
holy cow. this is genius. I got a bit lost after the calculus, but WOW.
WHY IS IT JUST THE SECOND COMING AGAINST MATH!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
The invention of mathematics, 2023, colorized:  🟠⚔️ e^iπ
6:50 to circle lots of sin frequency to right. to circle lots of cos frequency to up.
I bet this is what math majors sees in their dreams
hm something big and dark decided to follow e
SC learned more math in 10 minutes than I did in my whole school career
God damn the sound design in this video was amazing. It all sounds so crisp and clean.
Now Animation vs Spanish
Even though I didn't understand a good portion of the math, this was still a great video.
what's 9+10        21!
Не думал что когда-нибудь мне так будет интересна математика
Joder, esto si es cine  🗿🚬
Muito bom, incrivel como sempre🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤amei
I would like that TSC teached me math
part 2: animation vs 3b1b
Animation vs. Meth
This is how I'm going to teach math now
Can someone please tell me how Alef is significant to math? I'm Jewish and currently in Algebra, so I want to know.
미쳤다
Let’s Go A NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!
Ah, now I understand why cosine and sininus or whatever
"Now its time for everybodys favorite subject, math!"                                       -Baldi
if alan becker would make math tutorials id be a proffesional at math at this point
MOST OF ENGINEER UNDERSTAND CLEARLY LOL
I have no clue what just happened, but my God that was well made
God edit
i just want to say, i've been in college for 5 years, done ap algebra in highschool, college algebra twice with A's, trig, and multiple forms of calculus, but one now did someone plainly put why a RAD is what it is... i hate college now.
I never thought that mathematics would be so entertaining
The second coming because a mathematician, the video!
I only want to know one thing: what was that dot?
I would legit play a game where you shoot down bs math concepts
Im sorry did u just calculate dimensional travel
Magnus Opus
I never even thought that math could be animated like this, man u gonna be a big animator one fine day
note  100,000 in math
Mathematics, son.
Lol. What an idea man. We can't describe it with any word. COOOOOOL!!!
Yooo How about Animation vs. Coding next
The giant snake like e thing reminds me a lot of the Iron Doom from Ninjago
Just mind blowing amazing Keep it up alan
Jeez 1 million views in 5 hours?!? 🎉🎉🎉
Honestly a really cool Idea I'd love to see more subject like this (E.g. animation vs music where Green could be the main character)
Hi+meow
Well i think i didnt understand the and, but it is an interesting video. I dont like math to much, but i like the video <3
Alan Becker, I think you should make a game about these animations. I play 100% (but for free :D)
How to make learning math fun:
matematicas 2 la guerra entre las sumas
Y porque Alan se estará tardando en el nuevo video  X: pues
like + alan's video(creativity x n) = fun x n^2
it seems like hes dreaming after the animation vs animator
Вот как надо готовиться к экзаменам
.....i just watched a man make math interesting and understandable.....goddamm the talent needed for that
infinite numbers of dimensions
I feel like I just learnt 10 years worth of math
Cul😮😮😮😮😮:()
I'm too stupid to fully understand this video, but it's awesome anyway.  I feel bad for the children that will watch this in math class only for it to be paused by the teacher every few seconds so they can explain what sine and cosine is.
Yo vs mi profe
fact that every equation shown is true is amazing
Might as well make an Animation vs. Education (Chemistry, History, Music etc.)
wow that's good as always
E vs TCO = 3TCO^45
This will be their toughest challenge yet
Life lesson don’t get stuck in the calculator app
Oh. my god. Another one PLEASE!
Ждут 10 часовую версию ууууиие
Holy shit ive never learned so much about math before in 10 minutes
He made math actually look fun! I think if schools did this, math would be everyone's favorite subject
Алан можеш сделать так чтобы стикмены попали в другую игру как Майнкрафте  например Stick war legacy (3) надеюсь заметиш я хотел в увидеть такое
Math power ohio
The sound effects are amazing, those are the kind of sound effects I'd listen to every day
TSC made the fricken Death Star
I learned more math here than at school
As i saw the first minutes I was like" Cool, orange experiences basic math like adding  etc." but when I saw eulers formula it blew my mind
Didn't anderstand a bit but this looks hella cool, good job Alan
me everyday in math class
wait where did the second coming go????/???/???
i loved the cute scream at 10:02
I DID NOT ANDERSTAND
Animation vs Math>>>>>>>>>School lessons
Damn if this was real everyone would be math genius’ as ya know and I am sure everyone’s favourite subject would be math😂     Hey don’t say I copied because how is thinking the same thing copying??!!🤬                                       Why you still there?

por alguna razón me esta empezando a gustar las matemáticas
1+1 2😀😀
ngl this helped me understand things better than my actual math lessons lol
Hello
Tá
Oh e?
what happend here?
I love math. This is so accurate as well! There is a bunch of slightly deeper stuff(i saw that reference toℵ₀)
Once again, I am convinced that Alan is not an ordinary person who animates, this is the person who animates not 3D, not some super-high-quality models, he makes animation with such a plot and meaning that even pixar is silent.
cool and nice
I'm glad he was able to stop the division by 0 before the world exploded
Imagine having to do this much math for an animated stick figure fight scene, this is insane great job!
i hate you for making math interesting >:c
Soo cool
amazing
Didn't expect these maths to blow up to such a scale of complexity!
How did TSC to get inside a calculator?
ThiS IS REALLY EPIC
This is the best video I've ever seen that manages to combine fighting with mathematics, simply amazing, congratulations to the animators and the team that researched each equation to make this video😊😊😊
Again, another banger video.
Can't wait for tsc to explain what happened to the rest of the stickmen, especially yellow
Alan: *Uses a mix of advanced mathematics, great animation and immense creativity to create an intricate and complex fight with an overall story*  Me, who doesn't know shit about math: Cool fight lol
Directed by Baldi's Basics😂😂
What a wonderfull work you have done
Math if it was epic
Finally, my 12 years of math has become useful.
Only if I understood what most of the math ment
I wouldn't be surprised if the whole fight is one giant math calculation.
imagine fighting math
If this is what happens in my calculator, then I’ll know who to thank for making maths easy
this was beautiful
I dont usually write comments on videos, but this may habe genuinely been one of the BEST videos i have watched EVER!! It is so creative and entertaining, i cant thank you enough!
He broke the fabric of math and reality
EN TAN POCO TIEMPO 17 MIL COMENTARIOS WTF
5:06 My aim in shooter games be like ...
i understood about the first 20% of the video math wise but i don't need to in order to realize how crazy of a video this was.
What was it...damn I can't explain bruhhh
bro tought math better than school
Sometimes I wonder how he comes up with these brilliant ideas
In the future your math exam question is going to be to explain everything in this video
alternate title: Math: The Anime
Man, this makes math look sooooo fun!
^•^

I wonder what my math teachers would react if i showed them this video 🤔
epic
Mejor que julio profe
Hermano que fue eso adonde fue naranja
Is this going to be new siries?
I have no idea what I just watched, but it was hilarious and I loved it.
Imagine if he did 0/0
I'm waiting for part two.
Math is real hard cos sin log in wtf with x2 y2
Por eso reprobé matemáticas
Uhhh... Uhmmm.... Uhhh... Yeah? I like the animation.
Would the e i pi thing be called a math problem
My mind is blown
oh yeah
My brain exploded from all the math Alan is a master of math.
My question is why he didn't go into the physics part of math. Or maybe that's for another video?
My brain just blow up
This is how all of us should've learned math
That was amazing
very good, i enjoy
this masterpiece should have a people to understand it
And that kids, is how NaN is existant!
matemáticas hijo.jpg xdd
I'm not even a math nerd and I still found this awesome.
When Alan Becker does as much home work as lofi girl
10:02  best sound ever
I can tell you took inspiration from how you animated Clippy in AVA III for Euler :p
We need Animation vs. Videogame, as a Story based singleplayer game with the quality of the videos. This content is top tier with animations, story, graphics, music and everything else
wow
When did math become so cool🤯
WOW!!!! Just WOW! Talent is required to make this so good.
Only Alan who makes my least subject become the most
how does one make math look sick as hell
It's not the fights that keep me engaged it's the world building and how it gets broken constantly with now things to explore
wow increible
I definitely want to see some kind of breakdown explaining all this. Math is so very complicated and circular, both literally and metaphorically
I liked the part where it said “math” and proceeded to destroy reality
When the e screams it should be rush E
Comment where you lost it. I'm at 8:33, tf is this
MASTERPEICE
but where orange go?
My brain when i study be like
Is this our education in the future? interesting. Imagine there are group of game developer make this come true, it would be amazing and enjoyable way to learn new thing.
I want math classes like this. Alan what is the sound that is heard at the end?               ○        /|\ e     /\ a little draw
I AM A MATHEMATICS PRO
This guy is just a genius
1+1= i'm spanish
In this video, I learned -1 =i^2 =e^iπ =cos(π)+isin(π) =Σ  n=0  ∞  [(iπ)^n/n!] =(e^iπ+e^-iπ)/2+(e^iπ-e^-iπ)/2
Bro placed 11 years of math in 1 video💀
Okay we know what next series Alan Becker comes up with will break the internet
istg the e sounds like pacman
I was today years old when I realized that the division symbol was a dot being separated into 2, by a line
i love how so many fights in this series start for no reason  e chose violence for nothing lmao
wow
3b1b getting intense lately
Bro be making some complex calculations
He’s a math genius
BRO IS VERY GOOD 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
is it weird that I understood every meaning of this video without explination?
aww cute little animation! I love it :)
wish I had this to revise for my maths exam
this video makes me want to become a professional mathematician to understand it
Ué 14:02
Thank you alan for reminding me to clean my computer screen so i could see that thing at the end lmaooooo
Ah yes my favourite subject
Next up: Animation vs. History
math lore be like:
Tsc was the bad one in this, let him be man. Also, just wanted to say that this is by far one of the coolest videos i have ever seen, the music is so good and the fighting is also very cool. Cant belive u made the worst torture on planet earth interresting and cool
Wow
@DorFuchs Look at this!
Oh yeah!The maths is my favourite subject and I daily i do maths😁😁
POV: Everyone will say “MY EYES” at 13:24.
WHAT KIND OF GODLY POWER DOES THIS MAN HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE MATH FUN?!?!?!!?!?!?
Someone's gotta make this into a steam game
So *that's* what happens when you divide by 0!
I REALLY HOPE Adam will do more videos about Math 🧮🙏
Now i understand what is happening inside my calculator...
I learned more math than at school here
I actually can't believe the irony that I'm doing my math homework while watching this video. I was bamboozled on how you animated math into something so spectacular. This video kinda makes me excited and scared of the math that I have not learnt and will learn in the future.
10:02 why does that e sound like a baby tho 💀
I can see as much as I know. If you learned a lot of math, you can only admire this animation
Alan's Creativity = ♾️
I love the animation even though I always want to cry seeing anything math related
The + End =TheEnd The - end =The + End The + End - End = The   The + World =Theworld
Welp animation lost :(
Amen
Excellent !
That's ALOTTA math I will never understand
If my teacher ever showed us this. Math would be my favorite subject
Very good 👏👏👏👏
Pov: Steven Universe
By doing some complex algebra and replacing it 1 + 1 with X + Y, We can actually confirm that 1 + 1 = 3
Will we see this again?
Sometimes numbers are weapons
this felt like a lucid dream
Это больше чем прекрасно!!!
the power of number π
233345x3
Those math classes in high school paid off
Love it! This was amazing. I’m excited to see more amazing animations
How come I was never taught how to make a math cannon?
I can't understand while I am in class 6
Why couldn’t learning math be this easy
I failed my math test
What I wanna know is how TSC even ended up there. Was he like trapped in the computer's calculator or something?
What is next, Animation vs Chess? I really hope a new animation like this gets created
This is actually amazing! I love how they delved into more and more powerful fields of mathematics as the video went on, very creative!
Mi cerebro ahhh, la única forma de volver las matemáticas divertidas
I wonder how long this took
3:21 my brain just stoped working
he fell into the calculator app
this is fucking incredible when you don't understand the math, but even more so when you do. extremely clever animation. definitely some of your best works yet!!
Welcome to the stick figure equivalent of the backrooms!
That was the most Epic showdown of Math I have ever seen.
Wtf 🫥😨🤯
teacher:the math is not that hard! the math:
Why do I feel like this would be the most epic math game ever…
Doing action scene okey but doing this with math is really something else
Es tan inteligente la animacion que no le entendi casi nada
I can’t believe they did it… THEY MADE MATH FUN
My thoughts on math test be like
I never knew that math can be a weapon
Bro this animation vs math skill attack need to be add to  animator vs animaton VI 💀
orange just wanted to beat up e
10:30 albert einstein creating the nuke in a nutshell
I thought TSC was in a prison of the scientists who were testing their iq, it would have been an amazing plot twist.
This video is surprisingly satisfying.
i lost my mind
оранж.в конце :я стик.ло
Math teacher: The math I teach isn't scary. The math I see:
Мои сны после экзамена по математике
Учитель математики: Неужели мой урок настолько сложен? также я: Math teacher: Is my lesson really that hard? I also:
Damn, this is cinema
As an asian, I agree with this video...
Me 5hour
He missed the opportunity of seven eating nine and six be afraid
Grande alan ayudandonos para las ifces
Apa ada dari kalian habis lihat ini langsung pandai matematika?😅
Oranges new power: MATH
The Best animation of math ever
Best vid in a while great job Alan!!!
I've learned more about math in this video then my actual algebra class holy moly
Yo contra el examen 4:34
Bro put at the end of the video a giant letter in hebrew wow!
I cant believe Euler is now a character, wonder if he'll be part of the new arc
orange fr went shoop da woop at 10:35
Bro should've used Mathway 💀
Another banger as always.
this is how computers fight
what an amazing animation!!!!!!!!
Haunque no entienda, bueno estoy en 4 no se la raiz cuadrada
Wait what is the e thing and why does it keep going away?
oh HELL NAH I HAVE TO LEARN ALL THAT NOW?! I JUST GOT TO THE SIXTH GRADE AND THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO LEARN OH HELL NAH
Loved all the math easter eggs. I genuinely feel bad for anyone watching who doesn’t understand the complex plane. Amazing work!
Finally some more entertaining classes than the normal keys, thank you very much Alan ❤️
As a Math Nerd, this is officially my new favorite episode 😂
This video oughta cancel schools forever: No fr though, it goes to basic math to real intelligence
super mega giga enternal godly cool
SOO MATH REFERENCES I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!
Never knew math could be this awesome!
how do I imagine a math lesson in my head
This is god like
Neil Degrasse Tyson would have a chuckle watching this.
Math: exists Alan: I could make an animation outta this!
Awesome job
Ждём пока по этой анимации снимут фильм
I think that this is math world, and it have 2 parts. The black is basic calculator what we use, and white is home for math creations, like e^iπ, and anything is made with math (like white wall). Alan, please comment, if i right.
What is this music? It sounds so good! 🎶🎵
i understoond the math until 1+1
People saying math isnt cool. Alan out here proving them wrong.
Now we need animation vs meth
e
i already hated math a lot thank you alan XD
As a mathematician AND a fan of Alan's works, I can't describe how happy I am.
Me : playing with maths is hard And then Alan :
1+1"2
The video is beautiful but what's the name of the music on background?
Math lore:
Ok, I need more of this. This is my favorite Alan Becker animation.
holy molly everytime i watch your vids i'm stunned i always believe that nothing better will come but everytime i'm proven wrong
Cool
bro what
Honestly the best one so far
i made the video low quality and laggy at the same time
I'm in shock dude, this has got to be the best animation ive ever seen.
Hermoso video ❤ Se siente como un regalo de cumple xd
This is awesome.
This is going viral, I predict 69M views
Dang this is good.  University math is coming in handy.
Man, I don't even remember most of Pre-Algebra
bro taught everyone maths in a single videos
Bro who knew math could be fun
nobody expected this
AHH I MISSED THIS! THIS IS SO COOOL!  also, 0:24 I was expecting him to do 1 x 1 for some reason??  i also love how it goes from simple to complicated math as it moves on
Top notch animation
Гениально
math truly is infinite
Orange could become a harvard professor after this
Now I feel like a math teacher
it is impossible to enjoy the video and understand it at the same time
looks like I need to learn a lot more math
I'm kinda sad there wasn't a 9+10 joke, but besides my minor nitpicking, it's a 10/10 animation
This is definitely the best and most amazing animation I've ever seen, congratulations to Alan Becker and everyone involved.
Make a Animation vs Math(Computer Science)  Just learn the cs way and yea its complex in its own way example(1+1=10)
like, this is 3b1b level stuff man, great job!
broooo, im feeling so dumnb 😭  the begin was ok, but them i didn't understanded nothing more
Это... МАТЕМАТИЧЕСКИ
It would've been cool if Orange just threw all the numbers of pi at e^i pi
If this was the maths lessons at school everyone would go to school
Nah, this is art
👍
MAKE THIS A SERIES!! :D
I lost track of how the math worked about 1/3 the way through, but I still enjoyed every second of it, and still want more. The amount of creativity this man has is absolutely insane. I will gladly wait to see what he releases next
this is awesome but my dumbass cant understand shit- either way, 10/10
I swear this is what playing Elden ring is like
now i like math
Wow súper cool,you talk spanish? Hablo español y me gustan mucho tus vídeos😅
wait... Why did I just like math for a second?
The best animation of all time.
So math really is "1+1=pain". Got it! 😂
Animation vs English next?
Cant wait to see "Teacher reacts to Animation Vs Math"
Maths in a nutshell
only if math was like this in rl
No entendi nada y por eso se lleva mi like
Please do animation vs alphabet
Чисто я и математика
I've seen a stickman versus a mouse turn this
You know, each time this guy makes an animaton vs something video, he must take a damn long time to edit and create the animations. This guy deserves the amount of love and respect we show for his content. It's always amazing to think that a single guy is making such jam packed, smoothly animated videos. I'm glad this guy gets what he does
9:46 the transformer
This was a movie and a beautiful one at that
Now we just need the Color gang to meet Baldi's Basics
i wish i didn't forget things about math because this was so epic and i want to understand
But i wonder, when orange goes to the portal and thinks that he would return home...but he actually goes to ANOTHER dimension which is a subject like physics and chemistry and especially in chemistry it would go crazy with oxygen and hydrogen LOL
I misread this and thought it said Animation vs. Meth Really cool animation though!
Make 5 years of primary ❌ See 5 minutes of this ✅
Next video:Animation vs. Physics! GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
next year this is gonna be used in classrooms
This looks a fun way to learn math
There was a lot I understood in this, and yet it went by so fast it was hard for me to process exactly what was happening. Well done.
i think alan does way to much math lol
theory: at the end of AVA 6, all of the adventures that the stick figures have gone on (animation vs. pokemon, math, mario, arcade games, etc) will culminate into the final battle
this is great at teaching math
Every time I need to study for a math test I’m coming to this video
=)
such a good concept for a game  thank you very much :)
WOW. This. Is. WILD!!!
By the time I watched this it was uploaded 4 and 1/2 hours ago
By the time I watched this it was uploaded 4 and 1/2 hours ago
1+1=2  🤔   1+2=?
How did bro make math cooler
This is such a delight to the eye
FPS math 😂
Bro tried to devide by 0 💀💀💀
Thats was amazing :D
14 minute video basically summed up my whole elementary school experience
Bro just dropped the hardest math Lesson of the century
Wow
it’s disturbing how quickly I lost understanding when my ap calc exam score comes within like 2 weeks
I did enjoy this and seeing how you turned math into literal weapon but I still want to see episode 2. I wan to know what Red, Green, Yellow, and Blue are doing and how they're going to bust their friend out
Bro TSC is a super nerd
This is an amazing and interesting idea. Keep up the good work, Alan! And team
I really like the style animation  I like the firearm part
Pov: How teachers explain math:
The explanation of this video will be 30 hour
3:39 What ?!! I can't believe this channel will have anything related to imaginary numbers.
What an incredible way to learn mathematics, my respects
I wish it would came out earlier so that i can show my math teacher about this
niceee, awesome video!
math has never been this cool before
as somebody who loves math it was awesome watching this and seeing all the references inside it
Como mierd@ es que crea un video tan bueno con solo un stickman y las matemáticas,en serio este tipo es un maldito genio
man i've learnt more math from this video than from school
me gustan las matematicas pero no voya comprobar si todas las operaciones son correctas aunque se ve que si
s        q        u        a        r        e                r        o        o        t
This has to be one of the best pieces of creativity I've ever seen, taking something that mostly boring and turning it into something beautiful... truly amazing, bravo!
EPIC
pov:I'm inside my math teacher's head
wonderful, just gotta save this video so I can know how to do math I get stuck on when I'm in collage or something
My bro was trying to understand the universe
Ala me gustan tus videos
So this is what happens when you get stuck inside a calculator.
"Show me you're an asian animator without telling me you're an asian animator" Alan Becker:
1:40
yoooo orange got the death star
e = Albert einstein
pls part 2
Mi name is merya
Imagine all this math power in Alan's pc or even in the stickman universe
he is teaching better than my professor :0
how the hell can this man make MATH of all things cool
how did the math turn into this?
I am witnessing this after 3 hours of release. Remember me if this becomes an international video around the world about math .
I love math but everyone hates math :(
Bro i thought math is boring af but this firee🔥🔥🔥
I really like the sound design in this one, works amazingly with every scene.
Dude. The animation is so smooth and entertaining for 14 minutes! I don’t know why watching an orange stickman doing crazy math stuff is so interesting to watch, but it just is 😂
alan can just turn any thing into epic battles
5yr Old me pressing all the buttons I see on the calculator:
wow.
I have so many things to learn.
these videos are so good. and so smooth.   and alan draws it all.    its amazing.
Bro really turned something I hate into something cool
This is the most creative animation I seen I love this
We need the - ending
Just WoW. You did well.
It change nothing, teacher...
math good Ez easy
Hellow
phenomenal, simply phenomenal, unbelievable that you added so many references to math and even made a story for it (and my jaw dropped when aleph appears at the end 13:36) congratulations, just congratulations!
El mejor video de Alan de todos ❤
BRO...IDK WHAT IS HAPPENING BUT THIS IS INSANE, this a full LEGIT 1000% MASTERPIECE.
This video is proof that math can be fun when you make a stickman fight it
Only you could make math this cool
How to weaponize math:
Amazing this is so good🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Someone NEEDS to make a calculator with these systems; would be so much more fun.
This deserves a like from me! +1 like
THIS IS SO MESMERIZING TO WATCH
This animation made me giddy for math... MATH. Idk why but this felt more sci-fi to me than actual sci-fi tech, absolutely fantastic job form everyone involved!
Pov en porfa de matemáticas
Can't wait for animation vs geography!
やっぱり好き❤
True story on how humans discovered numbers and algebra.
XD
Watching this gives me ptsd from taking pre cal
you gotta do animation vs spelling next
*Just a regular math class in Ohio💀💀💀*
i have no idea what's going on but this is the coolest stickman animation video i saw for a long time :D really awesome
Math with sound effects is way more fun lmao
Is anyone else utterly confused at what they just watched 😂
Que grande, un Dios en la animación
Dang, Second comming is really a nerd...
My mom chasing me because I didn’t finish my math test
if he goes into a fight he's going to be smart as hell and he maybe win a fight because he's going to know what's going to happen in the next few seconds
So I didn’t get anything after he started to create the circle, can someone explain “euler’s” identity to me? And how any of that can even work
this was just a cinematic masterpeice, truly great
and then Satan said: "Let's put the alphabet in math"
1÷1 😵‍💫
Everyone doesn’t understand at least one element of this
im not like this banana video - not - banana = im like this video MATH :>
MASTERFUL
stickmultiverse please create
This is beautful
Yes yes!
Welcome to school my child
This is why you attend school kids.
Alan Becker Stay safe and I like your videos
My dude Alan did a full anime fight using math and i am impressed
Alan is not only a great animator, he's also able to make the most boring things in the world like math interesting to watch
lovely and powerful representation of Maths. Thanks for you efforts. I ❤ this.
Pov you need learn to exam but you animator 😂
for a moment, this made me like math
its the best channel
Walter + Math = my lawyers have advised me not to finish this joke
1+1=2
star wars refrence
Well that was an equation
This is the most interesting and amazing math video I will ever watch! You should do one for music theory next!!
BRO THOS IS A WHOLE FLIPING MOVIEEEE❤
And this is how the universe was made
This the 2nde most impresive animation you never show us, the 1rst is wanted- animation vs animator VI
Broski almost broke math Also as a calculus student I hate that I understood alot of this
math cant hurt you math:
Can this please turn into a series it’s so goos
9999 IQ 💪🧠
Summary of Mathematics and Math may complicated but it's beautiful if you apply it.
Alan always surprises
ㅏ
This is awesome! Whats next? Animation vs Geography? Vs Writing? Vs Spanish? VS PE?
this is literally Maths the movie
:O
NO IT NoT IT IS 2
Bro learned math in 4 mins and broke reality
I'm laughing by the fact if I'm orange I wouldn't get anywhere
The big E monster is something you will see in dark souls or elden ring
This made math kinda awesome not going to lie.
My brain isn't powerfull enough to understand this video but it is to adore it !
wake up honey new alan becker animation dropped
Absolute Amazing 🔥
I. Am. Speachless.
Oh no!  The scariest enemy of them all!
Ngl math feels like this sometimes the numbers are out to get you
God, if only math was this interesting to perform...
God, if only math was this interesting to perform...
This is literally how I wish my math lessons could look like...
I already know this is about to be a fire 🔥
Alan becker and khan academy collab?
I see, math was always a boss fight.  This is such an AMAZING animation.
This is without doubt a Math representation master piece
Siiiii, nuevo videooo
When did math become so... epic-
For once maths is actually interesting....
As a guy who learned Latin and ancient greek instead of math and physics, I have no idea of I have just seen, but I liked it anyway.
My brain will explode
En un par de minutos aprendi el uso de los números imaginarios sin jamas tener una clase de ellos  xD
How did I just learn and understand math because of a stick figure
Everything I knew about math in this video:           until 3:51 LOL   Now the real question is: How the hell did TCO even get here?
i wonder how much maths this took
next video: animation vs chemistry... i'm curious to see second coming fight against the elements
Little orange thing has discovered the universe!
Me when i do a math exam
You got me after 1+1
My brain can't understand This
👍
best concept EVER, this was so entertaining, while ALSO math related, wonderfull how you guys turned mathematics into weapons lol
e
Learn math in school: ❌ Learn math through Alan: ✅
Satisfying video
WHAT HAPPENED TO SC?!?!!
The composer needs a raise
He´s making learn fun. :) . But seriously, that amount of creativity poured in this one is something I´ve never seen, and that´s saying something given tha amount of time I´ve spent on the internet. It´s so unique and unmistakable you man.
This video explained math better than in my 4th grade...
bro became albert einstein
Her: is it big? Me:2:07
I still can't understand
Ngl that was a pretty awesome battle
If they taught me like  this in school I might’ve actually learned something
My mind when im in math class:
:]
God tier as always
Bro made a whole research on maths to make the video 😅. And i need someone like him to teach me maths 😂😂😅😅😢
waos
The fact I got most of this math shows how much time and effort went into this.
Trying to follow the math used, basic math, algebra, Trig, Calculus, Geometry. Been so long since i have done math like this myself, but the animation is phenomenal
Like si hablas español latino
How Alan came up with such a powerful idea
Es hermoso 😢
Bro took "math is the language of the universe" to a whole new level
The creativity and animation of this video are insane. You and your team kept one-upping every clever idea y'all had, and expressing it with fantastic design and precision. Amazing work.
This is elegant, Its just 5 minutes in and I cant stop pausing for all the details with imaginary numbers
So orange isn’t real anymore damn I liked him
damn is it beatiful
Mmmm solo hay un vídeo Pokémon de segunda generación yyyy las otras generaciones estraia cchhhiiiddoo 👍 lo harás porfa 🙏
Never in my life have I paid this much attention for math
As beloved childhood cartoon once said, this is 🌟MATHEMATICAL!!!🌟 Also that war cry was adorable 10:00. Why was it so cute, I kind of want it to win now.
I have no idea what just happened but I love it. Only Alan could make a battle with an equation epic.
1
OMG, the RREEEEEEEEEEEEH from the e, PRICELESS 😂
This video made me smarter I swear
Amazing!
1+1=^1bruh likle is 10billiom  iq
Best video by far
0:00
*- *
Everybody knows 1+1=2
And that Alaph Nul in the background at the end
I always knew math would be my enemy but my friend in the end
Jill Bearup, Jill Bearup, Jill Bearup! ...Hoping saying her name three times will summon the best YouTuber for breaking down battle scenes in regards to their storytelling.
This dude is probably one of the rare person who can make math that fun fr
Good animation 🔥😮
The fact that the final boss is integration 🤣
Alan every time fine way to educate himself ond us
I just realized he never did 0 divided by 0
I admit that I'm not a big fan of math, but your animation using this idea was pretty amazing
Это лучше чем любой урок математики ❤❤❤
TSC has some crazy dreams at night
imagine if there was a Animation vs Programming
My brain on exam:
This better than Disney 100%
:)))
the aleph null at the end was an amazing easter egg
Engineering student who understood it all but never been with a girl before. Should I re-check my life goals ?
Ta bueno
This is something they would show as an end of quarter treat in a college level calculus class
0:00
1+1=11
Me encanta como convierte las ecuaciones matemáticas en armas mortales
Bro knows how to make a masterpiece out of anything
you really make me understand math
I’m not just thinking this am I : my notebook when I’m bored in math
MAAAAAAAAATTTTHHH  AAAAAAAGGGIIIIIIEEEEEEEENNNNN!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
He just turned math into a freaking boss fight.... I've never loved math more
Why have I learnt more from this than school??
Our math teacher have that power💀
The thumbnail is so simple, it's the anti-clickbait, I never expected this master piece
I've always wanted a 2D game or something that uses math rules so like to get across a wall or obstacle you have to reverse yourself to get across, this is that thought but realized
Next time, Can you do Animation vs Python? (The programming language python)
2+2=fish
The music adds so much to it.
if he can make a cinematic out of math, I doubt he can't make a cinematic out of programming
that felt like a movie bro
Xd
I like this vdieo but i hate math😂
1,2m views in a few hours.. only Alan Becker can do that.
Thus is awesome
Orange is a mad scientist LOL
Please create an anime That would make me happy❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and 1+1=11
Hear his mighty BATTLE CRY; holder and influencer of the infinite light, master of space in existence, the embodiment of all things we know, and fear Him for all he is.
cool math games but its a real cool math game:
Despite learning all this stuff, my brain stopped functioning when we got division,
Buena animación
Que es lo que acabo de ver no comprendí pero me entretuve
This shit doin’ numbers
When are you going to make the second part of teaser
Let’s see if 50 part series for this
Bro trying to break through the physical of gravity and time💀
I'm this 🤏 close to study to be a math teacher so I can show this to my stundents.
Just a reminder that someone had to calculate all of this so it all made sense
Internet try to make another portal or math portal back to their dimension😊
Best way to learn matH lol
Y luego me dicen que las matemáticas no sirven
A start of a new seris perhaps?
I admire u, Alan
Only Alan Becker can make math interesting
ay mi serebro
H O W THE F U C K DID HE MAKE MATHS ACTUALLY I N T E R E S T I N G?
genius
This is math but you took the a and put an e
Вот такую математику я бы изучал.
nice
א
1+1.-Pure Mathematics!
This is how you get kids to learn math that don’t want to
I'm too dumb for this episode
1 + 1 =fish
ALAN WHAT THE HECK MAN ? HE MADE MATH FUN
9:46 I'm found there math transformer
You should make all the stickman in that same universe of math
this need tu be used ina school
This video, apart from being a work of art, shows us the power of mathematics and how the rush E song could not destroy everyone 😅
1.2 million views in 4 hours.
As someone that loves math and animations, this was the best thing i saw in YouTube.
Si yo quedo atrapado en ese lugar, no salgo más xd
I have learned more in this video, than I have learned in my high school honors math classes so far
2-24
Bro how are the comments 10 - 11 - 12 hours ago? The video was posted 5 hours ago
Avec les stickman tu faire une BD avec différente version comme une avec minecraft une autre avec le virabot et le stickman noire sinon tu fait de bonne vidéo lâche pas
How epic we wish math was
Math is cool
Everyone knows 1+1=11
Hum
If only math was this epic in real life hehe
This video made me think that math isn't really hard
数学が苦手なせいで全然理解できなかった... でもe×iπが良いやつだという事は分かった
Alan Becker tu eres un genio y quiero que sepas que tu y tu equipo es increíble en la creación de animaciones espero que esto dure por mucho tiempo mas y que podamos gozar de la vida de naranja y sus amigos.
Geometry teacher: "Now prove how all of this was done"
Somebody is getting a bunch of fans via math teachers showing this in class.
После этого видео мне захотелось узнать о математике ещё больше. Столько всего я ещё в ней не знаю!
What a math
I hope VR game using this contents
The animation taught me more math in 14 minutes than my whole semester. 😅😅
Make a another episode please!!
I'm gonna want a mathematician to react and explain this video and that is a reaction vid that I am gonna watch
acaso daniel carreon encontro a un digno rival?
You're a genius, Alan!
orangeinstein.
Doom but with maths
If this didnt give math lovers orgasms, I dont know what will ... I felt lost honestly, I did grab some stuff crazily even after like +10 years since I did an equation, but over all I enjoyed the animation
the giant aleph at the end was cool
With Alan's permission. I want to turn this into a VR game.
infinity is op
that is absolutely beautiful
math is my new fav subject after watching this :)
He's in the void but at least he's not dead lol
Bro you have to start coaching class of maths and it will be awesome
"Hey Strange,you know whats cooler than magic? Math!"  - Terkoiz,probably
HOW DID YOU MAKE THIS WORK AND MAKE IT WORK GOOD???
11:19 / 14:02 Spining TSC
Okay, this is amazingly animated. Unfortunately there is a mistake at 8:25. The exponential is complex, which means the sinus is multiplied by an i. Which means that when you later use the Euler formula for decomposing cos and sin, the sinus part, that is the right part, should be multiplied by an i, and there should't be any i at the denominator.
It's cool bro😮
Math is overpowered
What am I doing in school
Another banger from Alan Becker. I love this.
Boy, Imagine if math lessons were like this, it would be awesome
WE WANT ANIMATION VS SHAPS AND BEAT
In 11 minutes TSC had went from basic addition to creating a Hammer of Dawn
это самое гениальное что я видел за всё свою жизнь
He just made math look so damn cool
This has got to be the smartest animation on the entire internet!
orange is getting smarter! HES EVOLVING!!!
Multiverse Theory: Another orange becomes the E’s leader and creates Rush E to take over the world.
ai là nhân vật mạnh nhất trong toàn bộ các bộ anime và manga(ko tính the creator)
mejor explicado que en el colegio
Why is Orange there? Is it just for fun, or is there lore behind this?
fighting with -1 happens to the best of us
Am I the only one who sees this anime and this is just a filler episode
The formules used, I know its so correct
Wtf why is it actually accurate and good. I bet this could actually be used to teach someone math
This stuff is so cool
Schools should be like this
"The test isnt that hard" The test:
This was absolutely amazing.
1:34 여기서 -1=e^ipi 인걸 이용해서 처음으로 e^ipi가 등장, 이녀석을 이제 오일러라고 부르겠음. 오일려=-1 인건 그 유명한 오일러 등식에서 나온거임. 그리고 오일러는 자신에게 i를 곱해서 다른세계? 로 넘어감. 이 세계관에선 허수부분의 계수가 양수인 세계와 음수인 세계가 나뉘어있나봄. 어쨌든 오일러는 -i가 되어서 사라짐  4:00 오일러 재등장, i의 세제곱으로 -i를 만들어 사라졌든 i오일러를 소환. 오일러는 도망가다가 다시 자신에게 i를 곱해서 사라지려 했으나 주인공이 i를 맞춤으로써 i*i*오일러, 즉 -오일러가 되면서 막아냄.   4:15 유명한 오일러 공식 등장.  4:19 그래프의 대칭, 함수의 그래프 방정식에 x에 -를 붙이면 좌우반전이 되는것에서 나온 아이디어인듯.  4:22 이부분이 레전드인게 e^ipi 에서 pi가 의미하는게 바로 복소수 평면에서 pi만큼 회전한 건데, 그건 오일러 등식의 증명 아이디어 그 자체임. 이 아이디어로 복소수평면에서 pi만큼, 반원을 그리며 빠져나가는게 정말 재밌음.  5:18 점에서 시작하여, 수직선, 복소수평면 그리고 원을 만들어냄.  6:30 라디안의 정의  6:50 sin과 cos의 실수전체에서의 정의와 그래프  8:07 e^ix 의 무한급수를 이용한 정의. 이것도 정말 신기한 수학개념중 하나.  8:29 tan 함수를 만들어 레이저총처럼 사용함
When did math get complicated
No
e
Alans maths teacher would be proud
Hi
'Mathematics is good for the Soul' -Plato
We want to see episode 2:Calculus
When you learn more math from a 14 minute long animation than actual Math Class.
10:02 weee
The sc nah more like the scientist
Chemistry next?!
I saw 2 of my most favorite youtubers upload, andi chose this video, this video made me understand a few things like pi and other but i lost a couple braincells while watching
And this is why you shouldn't make a "syntax error" in real life
1,2m views in just 4 hours?
We want this series
SO GOOD!!
Это шикарная работа!Я заворожен,зная немного алгебру мне очень интересно наблюдать за этим,шикарная интерпретация чисел!!
This is mind-blowing! Imagine they make other subjects like physics, chemistry, biology as an animation. I will be very excited for chemistry.
It's been 4 hours and this ALLREADY has 1 million views
this was awesome but where did Orange Overlord go?
This is literally how math looks in my brain. Alan made it real! Now i can finally show people how cool math is.
Wow, I think it’s the best animation in history of Alan Becker Channel, I want more of this beautiful math illustrations and battles between stickman and math. It was amazing
For when the second part of animation vs animation
The  The + End part was so funny!
I'm having math exam on Monday, but seeing this genuinely make me remember a lot of things :"
My brain is overheating after that 💀 but still it was fun! That is actually cool! Those weapons calculations, are epic!
your stickman's math skills are like drinking straying meaning they are overpowered
Animation vs Met-
Its incredible how we saw this man's animations grow, from AvA, to AvM to one-shot works like this one, and how each time the animation keeps getting better, and plots more inviting. Only a great content creator like Alan would have been able to make something so entertaining, yet so simple...  In short: Keep up the good work, hero!!
Math class got nothing on this
То чуство когда видео без единого слова за 14 минут обьясняет тебе всю математику с 1 по 11 класс...
Mathis is so cool
The creativity of this is **insane**. Seeing all of these math concepts displayed like this ways and becoming more powerful as the math gets more and more complex is genius
teachers:takes around 14 years to teach math alan: 14 minutes take it or leave it
WHAT 4 HOURS AGO
I'm still in school so I only understand about 1/3 of this video. But I still like this so so much.
When math is hype
This was really epic. I could behind a magic system like this.
Impossible
The second coming be like "the last question i can never get right "
I've never been so fascinated by math until now hahah. I'm learning more from this animation than I did in school haha.
Great! Amazing! And for me and others understnd math is very incredible the work. Maybe a great idea, animation vs programation.  Congratulations!!
buaaaaaaaaaaa, ni en la univversidad te explican de manera tan detallada como se comportan algunas funciones en la realidad, como los cos y sen se explesan en los planos xy, al fin mi mente pudo comprende y graficar de buena forma estas cosas
i very don't like math but after  watch this video i want to study math-
Aprendo mas con Alan Becker que en la escuela xd
Ok, this is really cool.
my head hurts but im still impressed. 11/10
That Was very nice 😊
I had no idea what the hell was going on… but I don’t care, because as usual “That was epic.”
Instructions unclear teacher, my brain is
No way, bro found a way to make math cool.
As a mathematician, I can tell you that every day is like this. Once you've made friends with an infinite series, it will be eternally loyal to you.
Good!
Bro made a Calculus assault rifle to fight off Euler's number.
Hey Alan can you make a terraria vs animation video
In this video you can see how dangerous mathematics is
Bro this is so much more interesting then regular math Alan u bitch how did u make it look so good
You should make a mathematicians vs engineers next!!
i wish i was better at math so i got some of these jokes
Oh no orange got subtracted
Man the new google game is looking amazing this year
I understood this video more than my math classes 💀
Finally... a worthy opponent
That's one way to get insisted in math😂
When my calculator fights back
Alan acaba de volver las matemáticas en un shonen xd
Falto el procedimiento joven
I've never thought that math would make such a cool fighting scene
no entendí nada pero excelente video
what if there was other endings.
1:35 the lesson 1:39 the test
Wow cool I can't say it's fun 😃
Jarvis, enhance
If you were in this fight, which would hurt more, your body or your brain?
Why isnt math like this in real rife-
You guys have just done what 12+ years of compulsory math education failed to do... make me want to learn more math.  Brilliantly executed!
لا بجد يستحق التعب❤
That was epic
e
Absolotely amazing.
Yo esperaba que aparezca el signo del infinito, con eso ya el poder iba a ser.... Pues infinito xd
alan made math a reason to be fun
🤒🤒🤒🤒🤒😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😓😰😰😰😰😰😰😰🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
😲 I mean i hate math, but this? This is on a whole new level! If only they could teach it like 😩...
like who needs part 2
1:40 oh. Fun fact: explaining thjs is near impossible.
Am I the only one who didn't understand anything 💀😂?
I would not mind learning how to cross the multiverse through math and possibly becoming the embodiment of destruction.
That enormous size of aleph at the end made me crack up 🤣🤣
i have no idea what just happened but it was really cool
amee
Man, this taught me more about math symbols I’ve never learned about than school
loev math now :)
so cool
MAthnimation
Second Coming IQ feat is real
Que fumada más grande 😵😵😵
If Math's future's gonna be like this, Then I bet that it's gonna be a fun Subject to learn with all of those easy controls on the numbers and symbols and such. A Very Interesting Concept to see one day :T  Banger Animation as always tho, Alan. :D
I think that this was so far the best animation of all
Когда скучно на математике и ты играешь в конкуляторе
New video game idea: Math wars! Fight with math! ❤
thought this was gonna be like yea till college level math, no it is more than that
magnifico
did he just die at the end
As a person that's gonna take calculus, I'm scared
He explored the calculator
This so interesting When Litvordnik to do this video with озвучкой?
dang, i would attend this class every day
They really had to make this in the summer huh ><
no lie, this video is absolutely incredible
You would need an insane IQ to even stand a chance in this fight.
Wwooouuuu INCRIBLEEEEEE😆😆😆😆😆
Your animations are beautiful and you put a lot of effort, I hope your channel will grow well❤
Alternative title: Origin of petagorus
Wow
Did we seriously watch a stick figure solve equations that we can’t solve?
Todos los matemáticos: wtf amigo vos estás re loco y sus teorías
This innit school silly 🤓
Math is a beautiful thing. You simply need the right teacher to show it to you, and I was lucky to have one of those…  Numbers are as infinite as the universe.
Hi
That was goddamn amazing Alan the creativity you showed in this animation is beyond imagination
Honestly this was crazy, i didnt know almost a single thing when it got intense (i only know 7th grade math at the moment) but great work!
THE DEATH STAR FROM STAR WARS!?!?!? 10:35
I cant describe how good this animation is
This is so clever woah
is it just me or at the end there was a Hebrew letter that was a big boy
I love the end part of the big one being Aleph Null! Great video! Edit: Aleph null is all numbers that are whole so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . . . going to infinity.
So just think of math as a cool videogame
I wonder what that last one was,it wasn't very visible but it was there,what math symbol or math thing was that it was at the end when e was with his other math friends
This taught me more that school Maths is beauty
This video basically summarizes all the math classes I ever had: A mental fight to the death.
Good idea for learn math
And this is where we see how Orange learned math.
This 14 minute video is better than how all math teacher teaches
DUDE I JUST DID A FINAL EXAM ON SOME OF THIS, LEAVE ME ALONE 😭😭😭
Animation vs Meth 🗿🚬
Doom at home
If school was like this I would be Einstein by now
WoW, it's epic!!!!!!!!
this was just a math lesson in video form.
I recognised all of it until 10:11
1m in gust 4 hours? wow
27 years old and only now do I finally understand WHY ÷0 is so bad for machines
another day of not using sin, cos or tan
I love how the music progresses along with the situation
Man he should of divided 0 with 0
Orange: "Todo el conocimiento en la palma de mi mano"
Animation + math = good video Hmmm, the math checks out!
1.1Mil views in 4 hours, that's how you know this is good
4 hours ago??? Nice!!
an incredible word
Ehh
Hiiiiiiiiiiii i love your minecraft videos
Alan never stops to surprise me, I always loved math, this video just made me love it even more, Magnificent concept, by far my favorite video.
bro have either ptsd from math he's sharing with us, either he's a nerd that loves math and want us to know that
I cannot express how much I love this. This is the best video humanity has ever created! You took everything which is so great and amazing about math and made an epic action out of it! The idea is just perfect and animation and sound effects are on the highest level. I truly admire you ❤❤❤❤❤
e’s redemption arc had the audience in tears. Definitely a 10/10 movie.
This is so cool
It's so epic bro
Me dio ganas de aprender matemáticas
Bruh I just watched an action thriller in 14 minutes made of my math symbols that I don’t know of
A NEW STICKFIGURE EPISODE! WOOOOOOOOO 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
The stickman went from first grade to the full math system
太强了！
And they say math is hard; the man went through the whole curriculum in less than ten minutes!
should i put this on the projector in my math class
If only we had calculator laser guns
Dios mio Alan aprendi mas con el video que en la escuela 😊😊😊😊
The music and sound effects tho...
When i play Factorio
Holy crap!!! That was awesome! If this couldn't get people into math, nothing could
My dyscalculia ass trying to keep up with this video is comical
Bro I just understand what is radian for bruh….
I would actually be more encuraged to study math more if all tutorials were like this
This man just taught all of math within a matter of minutes.
아직 극한까지밖에 배우지 못한 학생이지만, 굉장히 흥미롭고 재미있게 볼 수 있었습니다! 완전히 이해할 수 있으면 좋을텐데..정말 천재적입니다.
gran video
Maths class would be alot more interesting if they taught us like that.
頭おかしくなりそう
MAKE MORE… please
First my mind got blowed because of these mathematics 😂.  2nd, some how its remember me interstellar movie. Nice animation bro.
and then there goes Fourier and Laplace
I didnt understand
Next up, Animation vs. Rocket Science
THIS IS EPIC
Bro made guns with MATH (literally)
Please tell me there is a sequel
This is why we Failed every subject the math teacher gives us! ☻
Plz part II!
Goddamn Alan, save some women for the rest of us.  Absolutely amazing.
Bro Alan is so creative that he created a math anime battle :0
I’m bouta show this to my math teacher
Absolutely no words can describe this animations.  But numbers can: 10/10
Hands up anybody 🙋‍♂️ currently having  existential crisis  trying to understand  anything about what  just happened in this
i need a game like this
I freakin LOVED this
i knew every math thing about this up until 5:39
이 짧은 영상의 수학의 신비가 모두 들어가 있는거 같아요🤩 이 영상을 보니 수학은 알면 알수록 마법 같네요
1+3 is 4 - 1 that’s 3 that’s quick math!😂🤯💀🔥💯
:)
How much interesting maths can be Maths:
Bro this is awesome I love you animations and I hope you can keep making more
Average ∞ fan: 🤓  Average א enjoyer: 🧔🏻‍♂️
It looks like war o.o
Вот как по мнению учителя мне пригодится математика
Ya sabemos que el animador estudio mucho matemáticas
Wow, this one is phenomenal!!!
If math was taught like that at school, then schools would become an interesting place
Next up, Animation vs Non-Linear Differential Equations
FINALLY A NEW ANIMATION!!!!
I can’t wait to see math youtubers react to this and explain it all. Here’s hoping the community gets this in front of those creators as soon as possible.
Imagine if a Teacher shows this to a class
never though math coud be that epic
Reason why I am casually studying maths My Teacher :
Me quedo claro mushashos
This is a piece of mathematics arts
TSC surpasses einstein.
I want a game about this
Rip orange
TBH, the orange is so rude. Providen that you fight the man when the very first glimpse. I will not say this us a good choice.
*math is not fun* This guy💀
I still hate math cool animation though
This is what VR should be used for
I love how halfway through it just becomes a cool fight scene and lots of people that haven't even learned algebra yet just focus on the fight. (I bet even geniuses just turn off their brains to watch the animation)
nice
king please make a game i swear i won't sleep i play it
DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING but it was interesting
Coming the forty-third minute of the exam.  My thoughts:
e
Could be so cool to do that stuff with physics theories. Like imagine using gravitpns to translate yourself to different Bran or changing making clones with super position. Or altering reality by literally pulling The strings. So much stuff just popped into my head just wow!
This was so awesome!!!
It's amazing ❤🎉
La e debe ser el problema que mas se te complica
Alan made everyone change their major to experience another side of calculus
ok but  how did he get here
No entendí mucho pero fue hermoso 😢 13:38
Beatifyllll❤❤
Pls next vid: animation vs math part 2 ?
Its math, but its so epic.
Tsc just speed ran through pretty much all of math in school
I got lost around Radius, at just got to the point where its too much to read in a couple seconds. good video!
THIS NEEDS A SEQUEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When you can demonstrate so many grades of math in just THREE MINUTES and I'm barely past exponents? Holy crow xD  EDIT: MORE PLS
I understood NONE of this. But I LOVE the animation! LOL!
This is one of the most unique and clever things I have ever seen
It`s awesome!
And I still don't know how it works. If Alan's nerd friend did the mathing here, does that mean he knows how to make a portal? /j /j /j /j
I'm not good at math, but this animation was too cool! Too bad I don't understand many of the math symbols...
The Second Coming learns math faster than I do
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2+2=🐟
Cant wait for this to be shown to every math class in america
i dont understand a single thing💀
11:01  FINAL SMAAASH
Teaching kids better than schools do
no one: how did you come up with this work of art Alan: I was just doing my math homework and I said to myself ''well, what if I put my stick figures to learn to add, subtract and etc.  haha, this episode was good, 1000 respects
what is next? animation vs science? vs geography?history??
i wish my math lessons were like ths
Math isn't that confusing   Math :
I didnt know alan was also a math genius
To think that eîπ-2 didn't start the conflict
Only you can make math cool dude.
It is amazing!
This is basically common core math
If there is a part 2, hopefully it has factorials and decimals
Quick Mafs
Bg kok baru bikin☺️
Love how it escalated from, 1+1=2 to building a Death Star
The perfect definition of playing doom on a calculator
That's math
Epik
Only someone like Alan can turn math into an epic and entertaining battle like this. Props to the animation team because God knows my brain is too smooth to understand a fraction of whatever the hell any of those equations were :)
Firstable good animation and I know some people here trying calculate what is going on here. And some of you are trying to see if there's any math mistakes so you can flag it to get likes
When your parents want you to be a mathematician but you want to be an animator
Bro is trying to get me to think about math during summer break ._.
watching this on yt for free feels like stealing
YES, YES, SOMEONE DID IT!!! STICKMAN vs. EQUATIONS!!! (I'm yelling like at 10:02)
se matemática fosse assim, eu estudaria todo dia só pra aprender essas abilidades.     Quando eu fui ver esse vídeo, chega eu fiquei todo confuso, teve uma hora que aparecia uns cálculos, bem diferentes, minha cabeça ainda tá tentando processar tudo isso. Finalmente deixaram a matemática muito legal, botando ação, quem não ver esse vídeo e ficar impressionado, meu amigo não tá bacana pra tí não mano (a).    Mais foi só isso que eu queria falar, só vê o vídeo e apreciem essa obra de arte 😁
the exam is easy  the exam:
Love it! Amazing story telling as always. Second Coming conquer the Math Universe quickly
that was so beautiful, I can't say it 😀🤩😃🥺😢😭
the creators brain is on fire after thinking so much math after uploading the video
Best of the best
The video is cool
maths is ez like imagine if it gets even impossible
do i am on crack?
This is what happens when you don't cut funding to schools
bro I learned more from this than in school
Math as a magic system. Marvelous.
Neden hep yeni karakterler iyi 5li(turuncu ve ekibi)ne hep düşmanlar ki?? Acaba düşman karakterler antivirüs olabilir mi???
Ojalá las matemáticas fueran así de interesantes y divertidas
2nd best yet season 3 is number 1 but i love math so this is a close second.
if math could just be less mid imagery and more like this  i would have a goood tiem
It’s nice that your making something that a lot of people think is boring into a exciting thing
Learning math with stickman orange is always fun!
part 2!Iloved it!
How the fuck u make things like Imaginary Numbers look cool‽
wonderful
I don't comment on video but this one blew my mind. Hats off to your creativity and genuinessness. Truly an wow moment for me
Ah yes, the greatest of all enemies: Statistics.
Some Person: "Math is boring, there is no way it can be fun and entertaining!"  Alan Becker: "Challenge Accepted"
brooo how cool animation
I love 💕 the maths
🫴🏻
LOVED THIS❤ Please Alan becker remember you make millions of peoples days do a little better! And aswell this video was a masterpiece i learned some math stuff and aswell had fun
There has to be someone one day who makes a math program that's visually capable of being seen and messed with manually VR get on it
I'm pathetically terrible at math and understood practically nothing after the first 3 minutes lol, but still absolutely loved it! As always, Alan and the gang's animations never disappoint!!
That was AWESOME
The huge number at the end is aleph null
Dude you need to make this a series
VERY GODDDDDDDDDDD
I never expected this to make me as happy as this did. You are awesome!
Where th e stands for evil.
This gives breaking bad vibes
Este video lo tiene que ver Zelen
Now I have a way to prove to my little sister that math is cool!
Now we want for physics too
but it would still be cool if math were like this xd.
Finally, I waited so long  To learn how to do *m a t h*
Who thought math would be this dope
Also it kinda reminds me of bingo’s dreamland from bluey ngl
Mi cabeza exploto
God I can even imagine imagining this
Good
I did not come here expecting a brief synopsis of the history of math... Yet here we are. Amazingly well done.
It's cooooooooolllll🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wtf. Math looks so interesting, when he plays with it!!!
You could replace Animation with Asian here and get the same results
Bro second coming might beat yellows iq
What did I just watch!!! The sound design made this 10x more amazing!
i like how aleph null is the biggest
I want to see animation vs roblox
The monster stomping around in the end... Nicely done!
Part two plz
Yellow would be perfect for this especially since he is super smart!😎
Amazing.
man that was super duper cool
Unreal 😮❤
Very well done alan, hope to see more lame things turned into crazy weird fights in a couple of months.
One of the only math related videos i've actually enjoyed seeing, Alan's the best at making animations as always!
Orange and e: 🗿☝️🤓
This is mesmerizing
Goat animation Goat animator
This is why we learned math in schools, to understand youtube videos.
You're crazy, but that's why we love you.
.......    ...........   .  ......
🤓☝
Impressive!
my brain blew up
Maths taecher would see this
It's really just beatiful. Instead of just telling children 1 plus 1 gives us 2, it would be way better to show it with animations. But of course who cares ? No one expect young ones and the one who really reliases what kind of bad choice it is. Whatever. I would love to see blue/red vs biology and green & purple vs music.
I’ve Learned about math from this video more than and going to school
😢
Weaponizing math:
The + end =The end
I want to do this
star wars in the person of a mathematician.
I bet that in one of the episodes it will cause a Black hole
now if only everyone put all their energy and effort into solving puzzles and math and all other subjects,  imagine how advanced we would be today amazing animation as always
This legitimately taught me a little bit more about math. This HAS to be shown in schools
Ddf
When math and Physics collided together:
Spoilers for the ending!      I love how the e met some unusual friends. The aleph⁰ surprised me.
It's amazing how Alan's creativity doesn't seem to have one thing, LIMIT
Would be part 2?
@alanbecker Hey Alan, U MUST MAKE MORE AVM battles, as a part time math/science nerd,  I  mean just imagine the possibilities a Literal INFINTY War or Animation vs Science!!!!! where its just a reality simulation game or something using Unreal engine 5 or something, or even just any field of knowledge, AvE(economics),AvP(Politics idk like have stick figure lead nations or something), one thing for sure u just unlock new possiblities visually, I really really hope u just let this new possibilities unfold
Is it weird that I now want to do the think I hated most (math) right now?
funnily enough eulers identity is probably the most versatile antagonist weve seen in this series
This is one of the most creative things I've ever seen on this channel. Like, making an animation with math, the most boring shit ever, and also making such a fight out of it, while it follows the laws of mathematics pretty well , is just insane. This makes math look really interesting and adventurous. Unlike in school...
It felt like i watched a whole movie bro.  I would love to see a whole animations v something movie i would love that.
Pop😊
Who is stronge e or E 😂
I feel like we might get a prequel to all of this, maybe something like “Animation Vs, Baldi”? Just an idea 😅
who else fighting the letter "e" rn
The video is awesome. Thank you
Can we get animation vs music?
This is an amazing concept! Now I imagine what if mathematics was a video game? Parabolas, shapes, numbers, all in a function can make an Interesting fighting game
bro just discovered math and is already better than me
I hate math but this was very fun to watch!
i was in shock when i read animation vs meth
this is amazing, as a math nerd i wish people had this as math class, so many people wouldn't hate it if it were taught like this
TSC made my mind soup up in the desert at 4pm in June with global warming to top it off.
Imagine if this was just a test for TSC made by victim and his organization
Bro orange is the smartest
🟠⚫️⚫️⚫️⚫️
This really shows the power of Math
WAKE UP BOYS!! IT HAS BEEN POSTED
what's this ∅?
オレンジはイーロン・マスクの親戚になった
ahuevo
Can you please he will be turning the others is red and yellow and green and blue where are they in orange you find one of them
HEADACHE
Good
I hope you enjoy the island.
Ai
I think this was your best video so far. Very good
How much I know, well I was doing good until half of the vid, so I guess im still lacking
i have never been so excited and concerned in one moment
I want the 1-Blade to be cannon in the Stickman lore
Lets hope Alan wont be canceled by the certain sign that showed up near the end of the video 👀 Ahem- 13:39  Also I know about its histroy is just that today its used by a very bad group of people
This is just perfect
i’ve never been so interested in math as i watched this video 😂 the animations are AMAAAAZING as always!!!
As a nerd I love this or obsessed with it ❤
i never thought math would be fun someone should make a vr game on this
wait so SC. became -1 matter (darkmatter)
ep2 ++++
Kino
I hate math, but your animation so cool
Sheeesh maths like this is crazy and looks coming l
wow is so strange and mysterious but is so good
Ay mi cabeza 🤯 de todas los animaciones estás me dejo sin palabras👌
2:01 wrong equation :)
Cool
Ehehehe math funky
I'm so glad I understand most of the math that's going on
The Aleph at the end though
If math was the final boss
Amazing as usual Mr. Becker. Crazy that you made this work so well. I know I didn’t fully get all the math references, but I can’t wait to see the inevitable “Professional mathematician reacts to Animation vs. Math” video somebody’ll make.
screw soup earth society, this is the better math lore.
Hi
Alan you done a amazing video on this I love the animation ❤
This tingles the math part of my brain thank you
Now that's what i call, Stick Math!
That's why I loose math😅😅
I like this video too much if I can put two likes I will. Orange is smarter than i thought to be able to make mathematical weapons. 10:53 Orange - do you see my higher intellect NOW ? e - Ho f###
I like that you added the + lol XD
bruh if it was this on real life, nah it will be the most FAMOUS thing on tha world
Wow its like its a game
Sayende 15 yıl sonra matematiği öğrendim Tesekkürler sensei...
I quit using math for good, now i use it for evil.
And that my friends, is a true math class
Gameplay trailer of math 2 be like:
Bruh I hate when Euler's number does that lmao
Do you know the news in Russia?
we want green VS music!!!!
the power of math be like:
Best
4:22 is slightly wrong e^(iπ-π) is about -.0432 not e^0 witch is 1. There should be parenthesis around the π-π like this e^(i(π-π)  7:41 ((iπ)^9)/(9!) should be about .0821   .235 is the value for n=8 not n=9  8:56  got 9 wrong in the same way as before  8:59 got 9 wrong again  9:14 got 9 right this time  9:32 you can't put infinity into a function.  assuming the function is tan(πx) the limit as it approaches infinity is 0 so It's not that bad. It really shouldn't be stronger though. It still equals 0 sames as any finite value you put in. What Orange really should have done is grab the whole summation and attach it to the f(x) because then it would equal 0+0+0+0... so it would make sense for it to shoot a lot of zeros.  11:36 the square root of -0 should not be here -0=+0 so it is a real number not imaginary.
i love meth
bro woke up and chose to speak maths💀💀
This should have starred Yellow.
you just made math 1000% more interesting
my mind hurts
Am I actually being surprised by numbers being animated?
that aleph-0 at the end... lol
This video is actually a math class.
you should do animation vs people playground next. just the perfect amount of chaotic
our average brain when we're trying to learn all of the stuff for the tomorrow test:
I don't know where this came from or why it exists  But that was very charming
lol bro good video omg :v
You are a fucking god of animation Alan becker 👌👌👌😎😎😎
i am math
The fact that this all went from 1 to a radius laser gun thingy is INSANE.
GG
:D
im gonna be serious here, these 14 minutes made me understand what my teacher couldnt in a whole year. thanks
Brilliant
Here I am without internet and the game is the calculator
pls part 2 plss
6+9= 69
Bro teach us about maths more than teachers
I learned more than school watching this
omg  the best video ever.I like you videos ❤
This makes me want to study math
YES I LOVED THIS SO MUCH I LOVE MATH
Thank you
I was keeping up until 8th minute. After that it was just action for me. So the teachers were right when they told me to learn my math. Because this is why I need it.
What next video
This man is a better teacher than all teachers combined. ❤❤
Bro I learned math from this episode great job alan 👍👍😁🎉
= ƒ (•)
I just remember all tha math i have been learn now i can be a math teacher
what was good and mind blowing
=f	(°)
This makes more sense then what teachers teach you
As a smart person once said knowledge is power🤓🔢
Holy shit...this is amazing
me learning to the power of in 5 seconds
Damn, I stopped understanding all the formulas and stuff a while ago, but this was awesome to watch!! Nice job to you, and your crew!!
Learned more about the stick figure from the video than from school curricula
This is truly amazing Mathematics explaining, I'm actually low at this subject but I can remember and know something about Math even I can't understand.
no se si orange sea capas de vencer esta vez
Это просто супер  Автор ты красавчик , как ты все это придумываешь , эффекты звука просту охренеешь
bro it went from average math class to odd squad???
This would be a perfect short to loop
This animation is so good i want a part 2 where X, Y and equations are introduced and TSC didn't left the math plane, just entered the "phase two" of it
O youtube deve se orgulhar com esse video
XD
I wonder how my math teachers would react if they saw this video?
Math are very powerful, they are everywhere. This video is literally a random person discovering math
Math so interesting
1:41 wowowowoh that scaled up fast 😅
Bro took Math is the language of the Universe into a whole nother level💀
Bruh I still don't know how much is 1+1... :(
Can you be my math teacher?
oh my god my college calculus teacher would LOVE THIS
now we know that Alan knows mathematics well
it would be perfect if the protagonist were yellow instead of TSC because yellow have so much knowledge about redstone (including maths)
More educational than my algebra class.
omg how did you have my idea for having numbers and operators as weapons
Yeah I didn't understand anything, but this was really cool 🔥
this is the only time in my life i like math
20 years late for me but this would be awesome for the future generation.
His IQ went from 100 to 200 fast
Excuse me, what
10:02 the scream💀
e
The fact that I understand most of this 💀 idk how to feel about It
нихрена не понятно,но прикольно😅😅😅
Baldi's basics
These reminds me of the exams of Assassination Classroom
e
Love it
突然找到學數學的意義😂😂
Math enjoier
@3blue1brown
Good lord, it happened again.  Alan's storytelling expertise duped me into caring about math, of all things.  He's a damn wizard.
Can't wait for all the math channels to do breakdowns of this video. It's incredible how much is packed in here.
this is one of the most genius videos on the entire platform. i have no words.
😮bro teaches us ,math with animations
Epic!
This is my new favorite video on youtube
4 hr and 1m VIEWS. Help-
i think alan's son failed math so he tried to make it interesting 😂
After he made a gun with math i genuinely didnt know any number/letter they were using                                    Signal of love:MASTER SPARK
probably could have played white noise on static images for 14 minutes and i would have got about the same. Cool animation but the premise was pointless...
THAT IS SO DAMN COOL
Absolutely fantastic, and it surprised me how much of this I actually still remembered from high school
Haha this is so cool and well put together! Alan, you truly have a lot of talent. Don't let anybody take that away from you. (Even if you are a math nerd haha)
That Aleph in the background makes so much sense!   I especially loved the use of the giant graph to execute a wave that just obliterated everything! Great animation as always. 🎉
Whats next animation vs letters
Amazing animation Alan! Love the detail to this animation! Will leave a like👍
Alternate title: orange figures out the universe
Bro hit 1mil Views in 4 hours, that’s gotta be a record
Fico impressionado que o Laranja consegue se adaptar a qualquer ambiente, entendo a forma das coisas e trasforma-las em armas de combate
math = boring; Alan B.: Hmm... War in math
천재라 칭할 수 밖에 없는 사람. 그는 앨런
1M viewer in just 4 hours.I glad ppl love math.
maths is surely deadly
DUDE THIS WAS ENTERTAINING IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE, I don't know crap about math BUUT I did understand what WAS happening some how, the whole fight between them two, and in the beginning he was all curios and doing random stuff, that's alot to prove how smart orange holo head is
All the kid’s in middle school: HUH!? The kids in high school: oh yea. All the adults at home: wait, what?
Me when im bored in class with a calculator
We need more subjects done. This is by far one of the coolest and most clever animations Ive ever seen
Math is not as fun because we can't interact with it like this
The road to university:
Alan Brother, can you please give me a math lesson in your spare time?
Maths being favourite subject of mine i really love it bro❤❤ love form india🇮🇳
Incredible
A NEW SERIES!! LET'S GOOO!!
как 14 минутное видео смогло объяснить то же самое что и школа за 11 лет
TRULY masterpiece!
Breaking Math.
this is not animation this an game
You should do a fnaf one
1:52 Bro Really said "where's my answer?"
lil bro made a fucking death star out of math 💀💀💀💀
What next?  Coding?
4+4 -?
If math were this interactive in a VR space, I think a lot of us would be trying to learn more and more about it.
Best math vid no cap
I'm so lost at 13:05. I remembered when I was a kid I also imagined epic battles with math and physics symbols dancing all over the place, which was awesome but stupid at the same time. Can't believe someone actually made it into an animation!!! Let your imagination run wild!
My brain barely understands anything of what happened
Orange takes his hammer out from the virus episode
Pin me ❤️
As a person who hates math, it is extremely satisfying to see math being used to destroy itself.
Orange exit to the matrice
Yayy
I want animation vs science
א
dis video is bad ... like it not a bad video but it bad ... as someone dat fail math on almost all my test in school, dis hurt my brain
omg math is everything man it's even war
This has got to be one of the greatest I've ever seen on Youtube.
Everyone gangsta until math nerds start explaining lore and numbers in the comments
This just shows that math is way deeper than we think
Came here from Terrance Tao!
I dont know how you get this kind of ideas but they are amazing
My brain hurts
i haven't seen a letter E with this much personality since Sesame Street
I don't know where you got all those math formulas from
nose de donde te sacaste todas esas formulas matemáticas
NEW FAVORITE VIDEO.  as a [redacted] major, can confirm e is both useful & terrifying
Finally, we found the strongest opponent for TSC  "e"
OH MY GOD! I loved seeing the sin and cos on the circle. THIS WAS AMAZING Nevermind... WAS THAT A INTEGER!!!
I love the whole vid but what is the ending
Я в абсолютном восторге! Надо иметь неподражаемую фантазию, чтобы это создать! Автор – гений!
Don't mess with Euler's number 😅
He good at math it seems like
And 1=1 = forever?
진짜 천재야 그는..!!
This would look nice as a calculator
I like how aleph null was towering over all the others
oh WOW!!!! Quite possibly the most interesting math related video I've ever seen. Now I want to see some kind of math puzzle game with similar intuition like this. Clicking on a number breaks it down, scrolling over a multiplication or division symbol shows all possible variations of the same equation, etc. There's no tutorial or workbook, so the only way to progress is to experiment. Something like that would make math so much more accessible. Hell, I have almost every crafting recipe in Minecraft memorized, yet AP Calc just disappeared from my memory the moment I finished the class.
This is how I do math in my head
The math and the black backround makes me feel like I'm watching a khan academy video
And it all started from a “1=1”
Prefiro assisti isso doque fica em escola
How did you make math so cool
Orange is getting to powerful he’s learning math also this video got me confused the whole time 💀
This went from kindergarten to like 12 grade so fast
Will the Minecraft animations continue
this is cool, tbh they should make a part 2 for what conflicts will happen next
Forget school im watching this
Well, TSC did learn some stuff from something like 1+1 to §€÷¥{€==+762873+*73+8_$;28-_;#7&_(_(_82++_8$+2;37$+#+38&+$+$_+_88#+3;_+8$2-8282+298$+_
Mi cerebro en las clases de matematicas:
i have a question. how did he get there???
Enjoyed it so much, with the math detail
As someone barely going to the 7th grade I barely understand anything but it looks really cool! Good job!
Best vidio I have ever seen ❤
Me calculating when I'll get a gf :
Couldn’t eulers number just deflect even SC’s most powerful blast with the limit? Even sin and cos can’t exist at the limit.
I dind't understand s hit. Never do animation vs Progaramation
Mathematics?
is so cool
Sin importar de lo que haga las animaciones, Alan siempre hace lo mejor
My headcanon for this is that TSC has entered a meditative stasis while imprisoned to awaken to his Chosen One powers, and may continue to battle against complex, abstract concepts as a means of self-discovery.
Alan can u put this on cool math games?
Пов : я когда мне сказали поиграть в калькулятор
Bro learned math in 15 minutes, wow
Bro if this was in school💀💀
Lol
now we need a part 2, its to good to not have a part 2
What I'm suppose to think about at math exams: 0:12 What I think about: 4:08
Now do C++ plz!
Gonna send this to my Math teacher
Damn orange and e is a genius
animation vs geography lol
Bro that Stickman learns more math then me in 10 years XD
Cool
La mejor forma de aprender matemáticas es con stickmans quese parten la madre cada xapitulo
aaaaa.... Braiiiin huuuurts   uuuuuu... Who can relate?
Mis clases d mat  sirvieron para algo
That was amazing, I'm absolutely speechless.
Бро ты гений в нескольких смыслах
Wow math 😅
Alan: y si hacemos una animación sobre matemáticas?   X: por favor eso no va a funcionar   Alan:
And suddenly i am happy I learned about imaginary numbers at school
I'd like to see a 1 hour explanation video of what exactly happened!
Bro you are just genius so can you please make a series of this like minecraft. 🙏
Famliy 13:34
So that is why people say math is useful because you use for funny internet animations :D
we need a fucking movie and a game on it, good job alan, like a techie, I say you are a genius!
My math classes were useless, help in the end I didn't understand anything D:
best animation i ever watched
I can’t wait to be in high school and have the teacher ask what’s ei then I blow the entire classes mind
Bro made math look cool
this is sooo cool. You're so talented!!
This is a great video(orange is alive, btw), but still and incredible vid
The best math explanation what i ever seen
The + End = The End
A mi profe de mates le gustará esto xd, Alan, eres un completo genio!!
bros a god animation.. AND MATH?!!
The reason why I love this series so much isn't just because of the animation and choreography, but because rules of how the world works are established and are never broken. Regardless of how absurd fight scenes play out there's a careful balance to ensure that not a single rule is broken.
Second coming learned more than a decade of math in just 10 minutes
4:42 VADE RETRO "e"
el lenguaje del universo
Who here was Actually learning stuff from this?
bro if this was what i got put infront of me in school i would be the smmartest boy in the world
Hey done a great job tru out the years every video you made has Mill or more you done great Jon hope you make more of your vid!
after i watched this math looks even more complicated ;-----;
This is why math is my enemy in my whole life.
Top notch animation. The sound design is JUST AMAZING! God Tier!
My brain on exams:
bro made math more fun
Never realized Math can be this much fun!
Best Animation!
2+3=5 ;3
Wow, I know none of this math!
I LOVED THAT
My brain
"There Are no limitations to math no matter how many equations there are."                                                                                          - 𝑒𝑖𝜋 (probably)
Wow. This is amazing. I wonder if TSC kept any of those numbers. This wouldn't of been for nothing right?  What are you hiding alan!
Many thing that i learn because of this video
I understood none of that.
Alan Backer should so something with Science stuff next. Would be very interesting like this video
Bro made math fun
Rush E:
Bro
Gd be like
Stick Figure vs NumberLore
My God the sound design
I never knew stickmen can use math as a weapon. Maybe there is a stickman that can use the computer's apps and existence as a weapon
I liked it because it represents my thoughts in an exam.
We need a series on this like animation vs mincraft
Dude this would be cool series ngl
Finally we have evidence that math is cool.
I didnt get anhything but, that was awesome...         Bad english alert (!)
better than Minecraft
I understood the first 3 minutes, then the action got involved and i could only focus on the cool fights
The mathematics 😮
Cool
Recuerdo que una vez dibuje unos Stickmans vs el abecedario y los números  ayudaban a los Stickmans y este vídeo me acordo de eso siento como si lo predijiera XD
Ñ
even basic maths I didn't understand
me everyday fighting my demons in math class:
Honestly, I hope this continues with similar subjects.  Animation vs Music would be so interesting because I feel there’s also heavy math involved in it
This man’s creativity will never cease.
i like how TSC knows how to use a rapier 7:21
Ah. My ancient enemy... *M  A  T  H.*
I am a student in Japan and very much looking forward to learning these things in less than a few more years!  Thanks for giving me something to look forward to! (Sorry for my poor English.)
an excellent quality animation to learn mathematics
I've never seen math through such a beautiful lense
За это видео я понял про матешу больше чем за школу.
I'ma show this to my math teacher
.-.?
even my math teacher cant deffeat the letter e
Please make this a series!
I have never felt such sympathy for math this was so cool
Good!
Playing in Desmos Graphing Calculator be like:
I didn't think the original saga would be surpassed, but this is definitely the best video on this channel.
Leave it to Alan and his team to make something so engaging out 9f FRICKIN' MATH  Hats off to yall.
Pov: you’re fighting the boss with the most amount of forms ever created
Damn ❤
so no one is gonna talk about 5:34, where he draws a PERFECC CIRCLESSSSS
ゼータ関数ってこんな可愛かったのか…w
Matemáticas con Alan Becker xd
*what?...*
I LOVED THIS CUZ ITS MAKING MATH BETTER FOR ME!1!1
OMG! Even though I’m poor at math, but I like this video and it could be loved for mathematical skilled people. Anyway, that’s the most amazing and interesting video in the whole stick figure series so far. I wish the sequel!
hi sticks man I love your  video
My god
Mucho texto
It all started with 1+1 and then I blinked and then all of a sudden there a bunch of chaos of equations I don’t understand 😂
I finally understand math
Alan you are wonderfull. I mean, I like maths and this is the best thing ever. PLEASE GIVE TO US A SECOND PART SOON
I dont see 152 fruits anywhere
112
Best way to use math
Math Teachers: Ready to learn Math? Alan: Ready to see Math?
This is one of the best videos I have loved to watch, very good work Alan continues with your great videos, they are always the best to entertain me :).
this is masterpiece
After watching this video, math in general My opinion is that math is an endless space of some strange numbers that people don't know.
great animation
epic animation
Masterpiece.... Absolute banger than any action movie❤❤❤ Love it mann 👍
This was absolutely fantastic. I’m not a big math nerd, but this is still beautiful!  P.S: Animation vs Python is next, print (“The End?”) /hj
math
Did anyone notice this video is made for dark mode users like me 😅😅
I love Maths
I am too stupid for a stick man animation 😞
11:34 This guy literally broke the math
*me who understand math laughing real hard  seeing comment saying if math was like this*
My man really started a fight with an e..
How to learn math effectively Google: repeat and always try different formulas. Bing:
You know it's good when Alan uploads videos like this
WE MAKING IT OUT OF PREHONORS WITH THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥💯💯‼️‼️‼️⁉️⁉️⁉️
If math teachers would show this in schools everyone would love math
I learned the whole math in a video😺
GOD
is at the end a giant alf from the hebrew alphabet there?
I'm gona use ur video to learn cuz it soo fun to watch this is my favori
I thought yellow would be in it cause he is a redstone scientist so he would know simple math
Bro educated me in 69 languages🥸
I love your videos and I love you 💕🥰  :)
too
This is literally the best thing ever created
È stato un trip mentale
tcs has a genuis power?
i'd be the happiest person in the world if I had a calculator like this
I'm a simple person. I see Alan Becker, I click like
too much math  brain hurty
One word: breathtaking
This needs to be shown in schools, the animation is utterly amazing
SC to Euler's Identity: "Look, mate, I just wanna know what the F*CK you are--"  Euler's Identity, trying to kill him: "YOU WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND ME, YOU HEAR ME!?"
Alternative title: how to make make more interesting.
Not sure if the --3 in 2:15 was planned or im just dirty minded
Best video on the internet what is your creativity alan bhaiya this is insan please make more episode on this video please like this topic so much i will suggest this video to my friends also please make more animation on this insan insan insan
This will be 1 and last time I will pay that much attention to match 😅
Bro finds the logic of the universe then potentially breaks reality
I accidentally disliked and now liked and it said feedback shared with creator when I accidentally disliked don’t hate me pls
God, I wish I knew why certain things do these things, like why it's an e that's the antagonist, why the i makes portals, and all the other complexity stuff
this motivated me to figure out what 2+2 is (it was 5 all along)
Me encantó 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Your team and you made a fight using numbers NUMBERS I believe you can do anything.
Bro literally creating weaponry from math that is baller
alan casually shoving math into a video like yeah
Alan is the guy who could make a video educating and entertaining at the same time all in one video.
And this is why we shouldn't use letters in math XD Terkoiz really knows how to get me invested in math.
The audience demand, an animation vs physics
This was so soft and clear
I love math❤️❤️❤️❤️
1+1=2 guys
Alber Einsten dreams=
You know something I noticed was that the bogeyman was made of 2X2 and shot fours because 2×2 is four. And since E had a -4, adding one would make go from -4 to -3 to -2 to -1 and then to 0.
Imagine all the fight scenes with math 😂     I can’t wait!
4 hours in and a miilon vievs❤
こういうのがあれば数学が好きだったのにと思う
1+1 isn't 2 it's 11
I need a videogame like this. It would teach math, be fun and test it
Animation vs **math**
I don't know what to say
We all can feel the pain of the Animation. Who doesn't hate maths?
As a math nerd, this made me so happy!
10:02 wth
nice. Alan Becker is taking this math video to a whole new level. this is much better than those math lessons in school
Como se llama el simbolo gigante del final?
This need a hole lecture to explain what is going on logically, congratulations on this masterpiece 🎉
This is why I hate math it is evil
2
And that why math is king of science 😂
God damn GOOD! keep up the frickin awesome videos man!
part 2 please!
Most powerful character in fiction, real,mythology,philosophy                   Math
1+1?
Bro made the star wars death star, but better
math has never been so much fun
It's both fun and informative! Alan is the best animator of stickmen in the world
so you’re telling me  i basically sat through a whole math lesson  because of a funny haha stick figure??
I have no idea what the hell happened, but it was extremely cool.
simply the best maths animation video on YouTube 😮
What happen with hi in where is the other for
That's another level of animation. Ho-ly!
What's 9 + 10 = 21
Bruh I didn't understand anything but its cool
Who knew math was this destructive
Man, i don't like maths. My brain goes in 4 stages  1: trying to learn 2: learns but is difficult 3: The more the difficult the mo-- * BLUE SCREEN * 4: *Brain.exe not responding* CPU 100% / Heat: 350°C... * Explodes *
So good👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
this was 8128. look up why this number is important, you’ll get it.
bro just let everyone love math
This Animation makes Math Look Super cool and fun
bro only knows how to add☠️
this made me and my brain go OOOOOOH
Alan, as an engineer, I LOVED THIS!! The integral boss gave me PTSD from Cal 2 though lol.
bro just taught math in the easiest way possible
math had never been scarier
Nice video❤
You are the best and your ideas are legendary
Im too stuipid to understand any of this.
I can't give more than 1 like? Balls
GOD
...........you lost me a e imagine pie..._wth_
Bro, i like so much that animations, alan is, easily, one of my favorite animators! When i started to watch this video i can't evade my eyes on this. I melted my brain, but worth it :D
My honest reaction about math
If this is what it takes for people to realize how beautiful math is, I am all for it.
I feel like this is a college project on mathematics
visualizing these concepts and watching someone else learn them for the first time from the most basic mechanics makes me really nostalgic... absolutely brilliant video, thank you (just in time for exams too lmao)
Not even the best math classes teach me as much as this animation, we all love you  ￼
What happened if 0 divide by 0 tho...
You deserve oscar award for this.
this is hands down the best yet!
Every animated child cartoon:
No entendi casi nada de lo ue se mostro mero me gusto toda la animación
Щ7щ7ш
Random math knowledge go
Very very good
MADRE MÍA WILLY
This would be fun if this was a game lol
Omg
In my whole life i never believe math is interesting until i saw this..
This actually taught me something
the ... ARTTT
This is higher mathematics
Bro awesome work ❤
Alan you pecked my curiosity and idk if math would become my favorite subject after watching this but all of that incredible work from you and your team
8:00 orange is cool
The maths is now more fun, If the teachers did this subject better, it would be like this animation so GOD
*Thank you I only knew code now I know code again*
I love this video so much but it was weirdly unsettling
Это просто невероятно огромная работа, она прекрасна. Я хочу продолжение, математика она ведь такая крутая и безграничная
If you can make math fun to watch then I think you can make anything fun
This man make math look fun and intimidating at the same time
Oh my god, Alan Becker you are a genius for concepts. This video is so freaking off the walls but it's just very advanced math being made weaponized by The Second Coming. It's incredible the work you put into this series and your animations, this one was truly outside the box thinking and I love it. The amount of care and effort you put into this lore is insane and in my opinion you outdo even most the people in the Hyun's Dojo community with your fights and ingenuity. Please keep up the amazing work and great storytelling without dialogue!
3:17   "PROCESSING THE DAMN HUGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION"................................................. ................................................................ ................................................................ ...........................ERROR 404 5:19
the animation is such a W it has 1M views in 4h
Oh man, does this video deserve an Oscars award or what? This animation just made doing math look visually interesting and satisfying in ways probably never thought possible and somehow made it feel like a full-on movie thriller.
This is why math is too powerful
Math is good subject
what.
Imagine one of the math teachers show this video to the class
Hehe e^ix=cosx+isinx  Thus e^i*pi=cos pi+ i sin pi = 1+ 0i.  In case anyone didn’t understand
Now this is the cool math game I want to play
Teacher: The test isn't that confusing The test:
I think I got less smarter watching this
See guys, I told you math was cool!
For absolutely hating math, this is rad
This can help me in my future math courses! Thank you for making this video more interesting! 😉
im in the last grade in secundary and i almost understand everithing
Mathematical!
E
Alan can literally make a full 14 minute video out of a boring subject in school.
Here before my cousin who’s obsessed with Alan Becker animations
yep, this is how every first year of any science degree feels like
All good till science shows up
Math is just that hard
The negative space was cool. But imagine if they started using math to calculate the 3d space.
Good to know
I can't think about how difficult it was to animate common knowledge using two rules: making it enjoyable but at the same time respecting reality 😰 ...it's just mind-blowing 🤯😶
this is cinema
Alan Becker is the only one to make math into an action movie
He went from 1=1 to the actual fundamentals of maths
My brain is not braining
this is crazy well done
Lol 10:01
Saber matemáticas me sirvió de algo
bro my littel cousin hate math and when he watch this he broke my phone
this vid was so cool and I actually learned something from this. if they taught this in math class it would be the best class
Im too dumb to understand this lol
This is it, The final boos is always going to be MATH!
Really amezing brother  that's a my favourite video ❤ From India 🇮🇳🇮🇳 keep growing
asi si aprendo matematicas
dobre
I love that when they discover squares and cubes, it actually shows them as squares and cubes
I don't know math, but now I think I do        It's a lie!!!
wild
im in 6th grade and this show a lot more to math and the possibilities for new math principles. great job alan becker
coooooooooooooooooll
If math were like this bro  Science is not my fav subject anymore it's math now but sadly it's not what we expected
Maths logic 😂
alright, I expect a full analysis in the comments
What?
Let's send this to the Math teacher
I really was waiting for the 0/0 one
Teacher: Exam will be easy The exam:
Wow
Whats 9 +10?
Fight is legendary >:)
Leave it to Alan and his team to make a 15 minute short of SC solving math problems and it still comes out a banger.
The animation
im a bit sorry for the e, it just wanted to be left alone...
Легендп зделала невозможное он зделал матешу интересной
I love that Alan puts a lot of love into his animations  Thank you very much Alan
The teacher: Alright class, time to tune into Animation vs Math! The entire class: Cheers The teacher: I made a handout with all the problems in the video! The entire class: Groaning Edit: Wait, I just realized the video is (kinda) looped
It Herts mi bran
tbh i love the sound effects it sounds amazing
MAAAAAAATTTTUHHHHHHHHHH
I can’t understand how everything works but it was fun to watch.
Math will be fun with alan becker.
"Maths isn't boring" Every maths teacher ever
Best math lesson ever
Imagine teachers play this in our classrooms-
This is one if not the best animation vs something other than Minecraft if you did another one it would be even cooler
Una gran lección de vida que se deja mediante las matemática que bueno que hagas esto ❤❤😊
My brain hurts I don't understand what's going on
Bro must be bloody hating Euler He's good dude. His only foible is that he damn loved math that he made modern highschool/university students demented
I feel smarter after watching this.
hehehe i love the giant aleph in the background at the end
This is probably the most satisfying video you have made yet I love it
ei +1 sword
Man lt 1+1=2
Dang he’s been able to upload his animations more lately the last one was 4 weeks ago, good job Alen Becker team.
Part 2?
that feeling when even a painted man understands mathematics better than you🥺🥺🥺:
Alan animation always good
This is why i like math
you are all literally geniuses
I want game like this video
Orange has became our teacher. (This has shown me so many thing about math I didnt even know, he might as well be my teacher lol)
Damn
How it feels when ur math teacher keeps giving u harder questions:
Oo my god....of the lord of the rings❤❤
Это просто великолепно...
"yes mom i did study"
my head hurt
I would like to thank YouTube for always putting Alan's new vid on the top of the page every time theres a new one 🎉
Это самая лучшая анимация, которую я знаю. Сделано ахриненно. Продолжай в том же духе
Dame u just made me like math love your work keep it up 07
En la vida soy TSC xd
WOW WHAT A NICE MOVIE (If math have power) THE BEST MOVIE ON MY LIFE
My math teacher explains me why math is cool:
This should be shown in schools.
pure cinema
I completely lost track of how any of the math worked after it progressed past making graphs but that was still the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.
He is stuck in math school
I really love this one. This is very interesting.🫠🥲🎉🎉🎉
here before 1m views lol
Math is hard and this just made it even harder
Im literally learning things that are not to my school grade (because im in first high school grade)
Bro became an imp from pvz garden warfare 2 😂 10:02
Enserio
4 hours ago
If math was this fun to watch, less people would skip class. I would rather watch an epic battle between an orange stick figure and an equation that can multiply itself and turn into weapons while the stick figure can use those weapons as weapons as well instead of watching a grown man with a monotone voice write equations and tell me  the diamater of the circle.
You manage to do the impossible: you had my entire attention during a math lesson and made me interested in math. And i freaking HATE math! I wish he would have divided by 0!
that is why always learn math
MIND BLOWING  I just loved it 🎉
Tham, I didn't expect Alan will make something about himself and his people's stereotype XD /s
Dos cosas que amo en solo un video, las matematicas y las pvtisas
TSC ya sabe desde la 1 al infinito xd
3:10 The quality is good, so it looks like it was made by a craftsman. Thank you for making such a high-quality video.
Second how the fuck did you get there 😭😭😭
Wow, it kind of resembles my experience with math. Starting with the basics, but finding out about weird statements like e^i pi = -1 long before I can understand it. Then I keep learning more and more, sometimes re-encountering it trying to see if I can make sense of it.
Windows 14 calculator
This is really a Masterpiece  Just love it
What is the the+end hmm
Вери гууд
I've learned more math in a 14-minute video than in years of school keep it up Alan your doing a great job
best math video ever
maths it it was good:
Also I understood the part where tsc first discovers sin & cos                           Edit:for some reason in math sin is pronounced sign
1+1=3
Too much math aaaaaahhh
I never knew math is that power full 🤔
If I watch this video several times, I will surely pass all the math exams
This video made Math make more sense than what we got taught in school, it's amazing
i just got out of school 2 days ago please don't make me think about math
I have no idea, what did I just watch, but I have enjoyed every second of it.
Bro. Where tf did this come from, and why tf did it hit so FRICKEN HARD! Great vid as always Alan.
Сау
Me encantaría que un Matematico reaccionara a este video explicará cada una de las expresiones que aparecen.
Okay but what’s 9 + 10?
This actually has a really cool vibe going for it. Love seeing something like this. nice!               imagine if he uses this power in Animation vs Animator 6
animation vs science should be next (or math again)
Cute
Bro me and orange discovering math in this vid lol
Maths students will get real feel and humor.
İt's just better than my math lessons
Nice to know that I can't understand anything
E
i love this episode the most GG alan becker
Алан превосходит самого себя с каждым своим видео!❤
Why wasnt there a question mark at the end i wanted to see E character develeopment more
Bro was literally making Weapons of Maths Destruction 💀
Math season 2: The war on eiπ
Can you add aim back please
Goooooood❤
Me vs the math exam be like:
this is just GENIUS!! love it!
im happy to say that i knew around 0% of the topics taught in this video.
I didnt  understand anything and fun fact I  even dont no alphabets too see- AGGIBUBBBLHVPUGUPGPUVUOYOFHOCHOCHOCHOCHLCHLCLHCHVHOCOHCGOCBHGOHPLKVOHOOXYZ
This is literally one of the most creative things I’ve ever seen, period.
Epic epic epiiiiiiiiiiiiiic epic music epic all
The Music is Perfect for Math
Totalmente original bien hecho
Yeah, 1+1=2
It looks like interstellar but more scientific
One day I will interview you so you could tell me what a lot of this meant.  I understood at least half of it, but a lot of it were things I forgot.
a+b=c  A=Alan B=Becker C=certified animator
shall you do animation vs minecraft dungeon
Good moring chat
Alan totally just turned math into Metroid!
Animation vs animator! Ok animation vs Math
I got my education and my entertainment at the same time
the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs
This was to perfect
hello i am from poland
1:50 It literally left orange in there like G-man (from half life) did to Gordon Freeman
Wow just wow
This is what people mean when they talk about loose magic systems
The only Animation that struggled to understand xD but I give this an amazing work of art, This just shows how I do against Math
Knowledge
Dammit, I thought it would be letters, math is kinda more cool tho cause there is more things
Math is power
well... they say that knowledge is power
was math discovered or invented? we dont know.
Even if im in 6th grade, im trying understand that in this video. Didnt even knew about existnce "eπ"
09:51 por eso a nadie le gustan los limites bro
That sum in the exponent changing into a grouping of 1s that was written diagonally (the opposite way from exponents) made me think for a moment it was tetration, but tetration with a bunch of ones would just result in one and hence not in the end result in the same thing as the operation being performed on the other side of the equality, so I quickly realized this was not the case.  Mostly, it's well-representative of mathematics. I liked the touch of e^(i*pi/4) 's jump matching the approproate angle.  I could probably gripe here or there - like the sequence of infinite series at the end where each series began at a progressively higher value of 2n and (since each original series converged) therefore should itself converge to zero as a sequence of the tail-ends of these series and hence wouldn't equal e^pi. (e^pi would instead be the original series starting at n=0)  But overall it was great, and I don't want to take away from that. I'm happy it exists.
I think I just learned more math from this 13 minute video than I have in school ever. Maybe it's just because this is perfect for a visual learner like me  Edit: Ended up being one of my favorite videos ever, and got me into trigonometry (Is it weird that I wanna go back to school now?)
He open the calculator app
Man that was incredibly fun. If only ma math lessons were like this.
Even though I don’t like math, you make it look really interesting to learn
How smart need to be, to do this animation, alan, we love you <3
Thats why i hate math
Imagine a teacher showing this and explaining all the math stuff
Поздравляю, оранжевый покорил реальность
This is great
Mathematics truly is a whole different world
Math was not my strongest subject in school, I can do the most basic stuff in my head and that's if I have a minute to really think about it. That being said obviously you don't have to be a math wizard to appreciate this video! Which I do hands down.
Amazing
El verdadero juego de la calculadora
GIVE ME MOREEE 🤤
I feel like I just learned all grades 1-12 about math in one video
I never thought I'd see a sword fight with math terms
Why is the eiπ angry
this is a fucking masterpiece holy shit great animation
Great video my favorite 🎉 Saludos desde México  Perdón no se ingles
It's amazing how you can see that the mathematical calculations are getting more and more complex throughout the video, just as it gets complex when we move from year to year at school
Nunca pense que las matemáticas podría ser tan divertida
2:49, Me when I forgot to stop the while loop in programming
As a student who just finished Precalculus: *AHHHHH IT'S THE UNIT CIRCLE COMING BACK TO HAUNT ME!!!!!!!!*  On a more serious note, I love the animation, and it was cool to be familiar with the math shown 😊
Idk what 'e' does in math but i'm sure this is just dreamy mathematical imagination masterpiece
please make a part 2 of this, this was very entertaining to watch!
2 ans
Yay
remember, cosin op af
El cuadrado de la hipotenusa es igual a la duma de los cuadrados de los catetos
This man made math cool
King just made the very most interesting math video on internet. This is just something else. Well freaking done 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Never been entertained by math this much
Yoooooo I'm waiting for your video for 4 days and you uploaded yaaaaay ❤❤❤
i hate maths but love this video
I want this lesson
1+1=2
How did TSC get into the math dimension at first place?
bro made math look fun
Orange kind a smarter than me lol
This video hurting my brain 🧠😵😖
I kinda wonder what is that enormous barely visible creature in the background that appears right after TSC leaves. It looks cool
Did i... really just watch a fight between Euler's identity and a stick figure? Your works are just beautiful and lovecraftian at the same time.
Ok, if this was a video game, I wouldn’t care if it involved math, it looks like fun
this is a mathsterpiece
е
Do animation vs alphabet
Will anyone talk about how the song played in the background fits  math sooo much! or it is just me?
POV: teachers make math fun
Okay this is legit amazing as heck!
but where did orange go
Is this what my calculator can do?
MANO TU É MUITO PIKA PRA FAZER A MATEMATICA SER INTERESSANTE KKKKKKKKKKK
WOW best animation ever!!!!!
I wouldn't be surprised if The Second Coming was just stuck in the calculator app on Alan's phone.
It taught me some math I didn't know. It also was amazing
This was incredible
Sinceramente me he perdido en el momento en el que aparecen los senos y cosenos
Y love THE sound of THE animation
bro is fr learning math again
This was beautiful :D
Please make more this Animation is realy cool
This is just a math lesson.
this was hypnotizing in a weird way it was straight up fascinating to see how all of this was displayed, amazing job
mind opened
Кто-то: уроки математики скучные Также уроки математики:
Only Alan Becker and his team could make an epic fight scene with math.
coolest video ever
Most epic and Knowledge video ever
the revision of the complex plane. and next week is my math test! perfect
Waiting for Animation VS Geography
Ah, alan never fails to make us happy again
Orange went and got himself stuck in the calculator app.
I thought e something was going to be the next villain
that final boss animation gave me chills fr
the sound design is phenomenal as always
Wah bagus sekali bikin nya sudah end lama banget  waduh
if this was math class right now i would love it
Vale la pena la espera por estás invreibles animaciones
I can't understand half the things that are going on here, but it's so epic
Второе пришествие=оранжевый stickman
"How do you make math fun?" Alan Becker:
This is what I mean by math
Do animation vs the whole world? Lol that would be amazing. + new sub
another one of the stickman series plisss
Not gonna lie I couldn’t follow half of what all that math was once the letters and shapes got involved. Still an absolute masterclass on animation though, nice work as always.
great vid man
Alan.... Just.... Alan (no words for this)
Me watching this video: I like your funny words magic man
My head explodes.
This is gorgeous
Fun fact: for those who don’t know, the giant monster at the end is actually alef.
This came entirely out of left field. I would definitely like to see more of those funny numbers that the orange guy no doubt smuggled out. Another fun idea is for one of them to make like ant man and get shrunk down to the atomic scale, so they can play with these strange little objects that stick to each other like spherical magnets.
Lo estaba esperando,que genial video
Bro made maths cool
Math tickles my brain in ways I don’t like at all, but this video was incredible. Amazing and top-quality work as always Alan! 🙌🔥
yeah😁
THE IMAGINARY WORLD! SUMMATIONS! THETA! TRIGONOMETRY! AAAAA THIS IS WHY I LEARNED MATH. IT ALL MAKES SO MUCH SENSE!
Это начало Второво Происшествия?
This taught me more about math than school.
how
yo sin entender nada: 🙂epico
Fps boss be like:
alan knows how to keep anyone interested in anything, even on my most hated subject.
I wonder if orange is gonna use what he learned for the next animation vs animator
People:Where are you study math?  Me:
Bro Taught us math in 14 minutes
How the other stickmen would do. Yellow- Redstone prodigy. Would only be in there for less than a minute before solving their way out. Blue- Combines things into potions constantly, would solve the basic additions and multiplication. Green- Artistic perfectionist, would take thr same amount of time as orange. Red- Would break down crying at 1+1 and e would let them go out of pity.
The animation looks amazing! And I can’t believe that 14minutes already passed so quickly.
yo finally
The infinity blade returns!
Imagine seeing your math teacher pulling up this vid in class
How teachers say you can use math in the real world
Even math teachers kept making math interesting but this man can😂😂😂
That was The best thing I have ever seen you make Holy shit
There is a point in wich your videos are just Art. You managed to make visual math and made it have sense. Amazing video, trully glorious
Bro imagine what animation vs science would be like.
Soon there will be many more math used animations. Hope they will make us see the math's secret wonderful world. Thank you Alan you're the best.
I love the 2 x 2 = 4 bow
This is a matherpiece
Dang... My imagination....  start think to much
Op
No way I learn more math in this video than in school Alan you are the best 🛐💖
i consider myself pretty much having borderline dyscalculia (nothing confirmed so it is pretty much an exaggeration despite me suffering a lot of trouble back in the day when i went to school and all that) but this was great even if i barely managed to understand.
Someone has got to make a game like this
W animation it's creative using math for a spectacular animation w alan
THIS WAS SO COOL
Me in calculus class after 50 minutes only to find that 1+1=3
Si  que  las  matrmáticas son  dificiles  de  dominar
Can you make animation of Countryballs? please
Algún día entenderé esta batalla y los cálculos en ella...creo
Ommggggggggg broooooooooooooooooooooooo
Absolutely amazing math references.
Никогда не думала что математика настолько увлекательна 😮
This was cool to watch well done
Holy crap...
For those wondering what the symbols at the end are, i believe those are all greek symbols mainly used in physics:  Giant S - Zeta Curly O - Delta Crossed O - Phi (EDIT) Dark X - Aleph (Hebrew symbol. Credit to otton.6212 in the comments from the AVGReacts video)
I wonder if there will be a sequel
The way that you combined some of the most complex math formulas, geometry, the more dimensions theory and the second coming, is just EPIC
To be clear, my lead animator is the math nerd behind all this. And as always, watch DJ and I talk about it: https://youtu.be/dRj3X7IFCjY
Great video 🔝👍
3:47 "... and the square root of one is one, the square root of one minus one is zero, and the square root of one minus one minus one is... _i?!_ Oh no! Did I break Math?"
I absolutely love that even if you don’t know any of this stuff it’s still nice to watch
Hola
Esto si fue matemáticas, no entendí nada :D
Dude, this is amazing, lovely, great, crazy, and... I don't know, no comment.
I have a little question Where are the stick firgues? And why is The Second Coming is only?
Это слишком идеально для нашего мира...
Please make this to a series.  This will be a great educational series for children and people who doesn't know it yet.
Good 🎉
This is literally the coolest math has ever and will ever look
my head hurts D:>
MORE
Cheeq yo ví en la portada 1+1=  ? Y me terminaron resumiendo toda la matemática ;v
My brain Just died
I JUST GOT HERE FROM ZUMOZUMO'S CHANNEL AND IM LIKE''YES LETS GOOOOOO I BET ZUMO GONNA MAKE SOME NEW VIDEOS FANMADE FROM THISSSS
💀 Im grade 6 and i cant solve these Equations
if i saw this when i studied math i would’ve had an A+
The visualization of how additive and multiplicative exponents work is honestly one of the best I've ever seen for explaining how they work.
0:
I believe that all the equations in this video are 100% correct, which means even in the action scenes there is intense mathematical accuracy.  Mad respect, this must've been hard to figure out quite a few of these, but then again I don't know calculus or complex geometry yet, so I don't know how hard it was.
how did bro humanize the letter e
Bruh my stomach rumbled at the same time as the e was rolling 😂 😂
Am I the only one who enjoys sounds?
orange learns math
math if fun ( this is how I see it A WAR ) >:)
So this is what finn meant when he said "Mathematical!!"
Hope to see a full break down of this video by some big brains youtuber
ЧТО ЗА ХЕРНЯ, Мужик сколько часов ты делал это? ЭТО ОХРЕНИТЕЛЬНО да там сделать половину секунды у меня бы заняло сто лет ЕБААААААТЬ, ТЫ КРУТ АЛАН.... ТЫ КРУТ
This episode was definitely a shout out to the math nerds out there.
I'm happy that Alan added aleph(ℵ) at the end
O cara manda muito
I can’t stop watching
this is so unnecessarily sick for being an animation about math
And that's how you make a death ray with just a flat circle
I’ve spent years in education trying to understand maths and a fucking stick figure gets it in 5 minutes. I want a refund.
I was here
Alan You could create a mathematical empire
wouldve been perfect if he hopped out the calculator app on alans computer at the end
Can't even do four digit devision
Math lore is gonna be complicated as Fnaf lore
You Are Mathematical genius Alan Becker was Becoming a Math of the Lagend
bro almost killed himself while dividing 0
What?
Before watch : ?  After watch : ? ? ?
Stick mans learn maths (everything) SO FAST!!!!
can you make "Animation vs I.T" ?
bro porque ahora es tan epico aprender matematicas
I never thought mad would be this interesting, it showed so many topics into an epic battle. Truly A masterpiece
jajaja
Incredible. Cute. Accurate.
How damn much I love a moment with imaginary numbers, thank you
Its getting to the point where Alan and his team can use anything and make it entertaining. Its getting out of control...
I like how isnted of the entier video just being orange fighting math terms its more of him using diffrent numbers and equstions to fight them off
Wow 😮
10/10
10:03  That scream😂
My man made math more dangerous💀
Respect to the 13 amazing animators who work on this!
Number lore but better
from now on if im studying math im coming to this video fr
This is a fun way to learn math.
Alan Becker, a man who made a video about math and have people actually care about it
cant believe sc beat the final boss of math in less than 14 minutes
I kid you not this might be one of the best most creative most inspired works of art I have ever seen
Wow. So much of this was so clever and was a joy to watch
they should show this on day 1 of advanced high school math classes.   or turn it into a video game.
AGHH MY HEAD WHAT THE HELL HE DOING IN THE CALCULATOR 🤨
We need a second part to this
why did I learn some math from this???
i can't believe the second coming didn't know math before today
There was something in the background at the end 😮
¿Animation vs fnaf?
Alan Becker how Animation+ Math make!? Genius Alan Becker how HOW!!! do You maked😊😅
I finally know what cosine and sine is High school failed us
This got complicated REAL quick.  Props to Alan for having to revisit math to make this.
i didnt understand a thing but i loved it anyways!
I have never been this intrested in math
I hope we can use Math to make a fun real fighting game.😂
I wouldn't have forgiven the e
I need to see everymath youtuber react to this! Mathologer, Matt Parker and the Numberphile gang, 3blue1brown in particular, EVERYONE! As a general math enjoyer, I was smiling throughout the entire video at everything! I can't even call anything here "references". Everything was just correct and accurate, with visuals to match. The sound design and musical composition were both excellent! All the sounds fit in ways that were mentally satisfying, and the music built a vibe of intrigue and determination or focus, before it went epic!  Alan and co, this was absolutely astonishing!
Bro became tony stick
feels illigal to watch you need to be paid per viewer wow
You need to watch it before math exams im 9th grades but i didnt get anything :D
теперь я хочу игру с этой механикой, но, думаю, она будет пипец сложной
the power of numbers:
Thanks for increasing my fear of function ;)
I never expected math to be so powerful this was absolutely amazing to watch I still never expected math of all things to be fighting the chosen one (or whatever the orange guy's name is) and it was really cool seeing him learn all of the different kinds of equations that was giving out to him and using them as weapons can't wait to see reaction videos from actual math scientist or whatever and possibly debunking a lot of the equations shown in here lol
Math in a summary but really not
👍❤️🇹🇷
At beem a while I’m  Glad to be back
How did this man make math look fun and awesome???
can not end like this with such a good video
The music really *is* pretty.
13:14 DUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUDUD
I like the fact that TSC know math just right away when he learns math in just a few minutes and know how to make circle or any other
How lonely orange is in this video
I love these animation scenes that aren’t with actual humanoid characters, but instead with numbers and fonts.  Makes it goofy, while at the same time making it amazing to watch because of the ideas these animators comes up with.  Nicely done Alan! 👏
I like math lol
can someone make this into a game i think theres actually something here that would become popular
Absolutely incredible
Sfx is so satisfying to listen to! And the little scream by the e thing was hilarious and unexpected 😂
π
This video reminds me how beautiful is math
next thing you know orange is going to develope and addiction the mathematics like how yellow is addicted to engineering
Part 2?
f(x)=100¹⁰x x stands for how much i like this video
Soooo... how is he going to explain this one to the other stickmen??
What just happened i didn't understand the video and i think I broke my brain as well
Impossível thankar
1+1=?
I'm not lying when I say that this legitimately made me understand a subject that in my math lessons I couldn't understand.  This video should be shown in schools at least once, it really is impressive not only the animation, but also the application of mathematics in it.  Alan creates the best masterpieces for sure.
Awesome video! Thanks to Alan Becker for a job well done!
Bro made math look fun
hello alan my name is srulik pleace do Animation vs undertale
This guy deserves a ∞ oscar
I learned more math from this video than I did from the whole school year 🤦🏽‍♂️
Math & chamistry & physics & history & philosophy
wow
alv
teacher:why is your homework not finished  me: a stick man was fighting it
i figured out why e is running. its because it never want to be figured out
Now I need a math channel to explain what just happened
Hi
My math teacher's dreams be like:
Who knew math was this interesting
I don’t know what I was expecting. All I know was that it was definitely NOT that. I had high expectations, and he went above and beyond.  (P.S. I’m sorry, did this man make math GUNS???)
Prart 2 ???you will also do part 2, you are interesting and I support you for the work done
Utterly delightful!
tq fr helping me skip 300 math classes
math can do a giant laser beam... cool
I don't like premiering videos because I'm not going to premiere them
Change my mind no one over the age of 13 learned anything from this video
여기 얼마나 많은 개념이 아름답게 들어갔는지 보고 깜짝 놀랐음
I hope there’s a 9 + 10 joke. Edit: there wasn’t, but the video was still VERY good, and it only got more creative every second.
Nah, idk that much about math. This video making my brain hurt but its too cool to just close
This video only showed me how much of a nerd I am. When he shot out that infinity and e blocked it, I literally shouted _"HE LIMITED IT?!"_
Cuando no creía que este hombre me pudiera impresionar   Sube este video y me pongo a gritar como una fan girl   La creatividad y superación de este hombre es increíblemente majestuoso  Gracias Alan y su equipo por traernos estos vídeos tan chulos
This fight was harder than king orange.
i never knew a stickman and math fighting would be entertaining
Xd
I imagined that a math antagonist would be minus or divide. Or maybe one of the letters from the greece alphabet like alpha.
Richard Watterson descrbing the calculator
I can't believe Alan animated this live very impressive my dude
PART 2
I actually don’t understand this🙂
Взрыв мозга.
U work well
8:24 My brain cell during math class
bro this is amazing, i never knew that math could actualy become a fight scene XD
Can we call the villain the timekeeper it's a good name for this fight.
: !
This guy made me loving a video with maths. He's strong.
Manim v99.9.9 be like:
When my math teacher told me that we could do EVERYTHING with math, I didn’t believe him, today I realize he was right. More seriously, this episode and very interesting, I could not understand all the calculations but it was a very nice achievement. The music expressed the feeling of reflection, of Orange’s research. A few very satisfying and impressive moments, the end showing an alternative version of a very dark world that is a very clear world. Alan and your team are the best. But, I have a question, how did Orange get here?
Yo this needs to be made into a game. I guarantee that everyone good at Math would become try hards
He just explained Math to me in 14 minutes and 2 seconds... better than my math teacher in 200+ hours.
2 ∞
haha
Simplemente wau
and your math:1+1=3
2:47 the best explanation why you can't divide by zero
I know barely anything about math and i barely understand whats going on lol
Amigo esta animación se merece un Oscar 👌
Of course it turned out cool...
i cant believe how he made a math video this fun for 14 mins..
Hes just manipulating the entire universe
That was crazy
So you are telling me that orange has had so much fun for so many years and he never went to school?
special thanks to my former anti autism math teacher for being the reason I only get 1% of this.
The PC 5 minutes later: 🔥
Alan: so i had a math exam and suddenly got an idea... Justify my answers with stickmans :D
Next: Animation vs Human history
Bro my mind was blown
See why us Asians love math 😂
Мне понравилось но я только 7 класс окончил так что я ничего не понял
Коротко о том, как гуманитарии представляют себе высшую математику
The + End = (The)+ End = (E-E) = nd +(The + nd) = Thend
me before ghis video : UGH MATH BORING Me when this video came : Woah math are very good
I was hoping for the Khan Academy Crossover, it would've been better than Endgame.
#1 mathematics teacher
Lost my Dad to ALS at the tale end of last year. He was a retired Math professor and would have loved this one.
this concept is sooo cool i want something intractable that does this
Wow creativity
e
no way he just made math lore
This is a great video
This is the first time i've ever been entertained by math.  Also TSC learned math faster than my dad leaving me 💀💀💀
this video gave me 152 iq
Bro Alan, You really crazy with your animations i love really your creativity bro
Make on audio vs Ani animation
If math was like this everyone would be fighting in trig class like it's fortnite 💀💀
I loved math before, I love it even more now.
yayayayayyayayayayay NEW EPISODE of.... Wat
I read animation vs meth
If only it was just another math lesson, how fun would math be.
The imagination put into this is absolutely insane
tought this was a short for a sec
animations vs number lore.
amo la cantidad de detalles y todas las operaciones y formulas bien hechas y estructuradas
To me, personally, one of your most impressive and fun videos!
This video is done by professionals. Don't try this at home.
Alan Becker can make anything entertaining at this point
Is there any mathematician that can help us understand if this is accurate to math, and if so, help explain it to us?
mike salcedo number lore be like:
Hmm damn this is hard
Man, this is how chaotic math can truly be...
This was incredible. Please make another one.
Alan Becker: How much of this math do you know? me: I think 71.6%
AMAZING, NEW, IMAGINATIVE, OUTSIDE THE BOX, 100% DUDE, HOW CAN A PERSON HAVE SO MUCH IMAGINATION!!!  You must have a great team man!!
nice
never thought I'd love smth math-related
This video is so CLEVER! If I had been shown this in school, it would have been a serious help. So many unique (but accurate) ways of describing what's going on!
You know, The Second Coming is kind of the villain here, ei^(iπ) was just trying not to get in the way.
What would have happened if they had divided by zero?
Behold: the stick figure the threw hands with Math
OMG I LOVE YOUR ANIMATION  And how The Seconde Coming was learning math then sudenly was fighting with it 😂😂😂 And restart learning back And where's the other ??? ( Maybe they're sleeping or watching TV ) 😅  BTS continue your animation it's soooo ✨ COOL ✨
Legend says that Orange is still doing math for years
😵
This is actually really relatable with how I generally see math. It's just a bunch of symbols with relations between them, and certain actions have reactions across the whole formula.  Also I just want to say that that visualization of the Cos()+iSin() formula reminds me a lot of Dark Fountains from Deltarune.
Me when I play with my countulator
As a huge fan of both math and your animations, this video is absolutely amazing! The way that SC learns about math by experimenting with moving symbols around reminds me of how I used to plug random functions into desmos to see what happened.   (Also, my brother was watching this with me and when the video ended he just said “so this is what math is like, right?”)
Does anyone notice the math is wrong?
Man, I hate math.
Lol I knew like 35% of this. I never knew that Alan was so smart haha!
3Blue1Brown is shaking from excitement somewhere, watching this amazing math animation!
bro just randomly upload the best future math class ever
me vs the math teacher
Que looooooooco
that was an crazy concept, but REALLY REALLY SUPER DUPPER WELL DONE, WOW AWESOME
and that, ladyes and gentlemen, is how 1+1 cause the world war 2.
This it's very cool. You must be very tired of making this animation
can you be my math teacher?
This is the best animation I've ever seen in my life❤
MY BRAIN HURTSඩා
hah nerd
Alan doesn't conquer the world because he doesn't want to.
Alan do animation vs bendy please
Wow. I love math, and Alan really helps me explore many beautiful aspects of it. Thank you so much!
This is literally beyond my comprehension. Truly stunning.
WHAT THA
Sc figuring out how infinity worked was basically a win button. Which makes sense.
I have no words... I used to imagine a world, where math is taught like that, a world where you can just intuitively feel every little step, but this video surpassed my wildest expectations!
e
WOW :0
Hands down the best animation you have ever made!
i didnt really understand, but it's a wonderful story
Me and my calculator.
When your about to do the math star test:
I was really hoping for a 0/0
Did Alan just break math?
nice videos
wow, just wow An excellent animation as always, I quite liked everything in it.ñ. Good job! 🤍🤍🤍
@standupmaths I think this is right up your ally.
I didn't know numbers could be so cool
This made taking calculus worth it because it made the concepts that much better
Lo admito es sine
Next: animation vs geology
Keep up the good work, Alan
9:55 kkkk o gritinho é o melhor kkkkkk espero um dia entender isso
Head cannon: TSC learned math from this while TSC is trapped in that cage from AvA (or my brain is complex and trying to combine all of the Animations vs. ______ into one universe when they're not) either way, awesome animation and my brain hurts 🥲
Lmao I’m literally taking a pre cal summer course rn. Imma send this to the group chat once the last unit is done.😂
THIS WAS THE BEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN
I think this should be an epic fight scene in a matrix like movie where some people gets stuck in some kind of math dimension !
This guy created a GIANT LASER... USING MATH?
3:48  The point after which I didn't understand the maths at all, but still the video was very interesting to watch
how to make math interesting
math is borin........
Einstain: soc must be smarter than me
better than demon slayer
The greatest fear for some is mathematics, for me a fun teaching🤔
I think this is ai generated video because you have to type all this sum and all
2:23 ahi me empezo a explotar el cerebro pero me gusto xd
Pov:you're Richard watterson
I saw things I didn’t understand but by watching this I now know more algebra and math
This was such a mindfuck! I never understood the purpose of math, but I picked up a few things here and there and visualizing them like this is seriously mind boggling! This felt like a movie! I was able to resonate with what was happening, this felt like a threat understanding what the imaginary space is, I mean I never understood the point of inventing imaginary numbers but for only to convince ourselves that there is a solution for this particular problem. Man this is amazing, I know I would've typed anything math related wrong, but this is AMAZING!!! Awesome Work!!
We need an explanation video for this, because I understood only about half of these concepts!  Pretty engaging! Nice video, Alan!
Good job on this @terkoiz !!!!!
8:34 Gun of MATH lol
the strongest weapon in ava,avm : infinity gun ,user:THE SECOND COMING and was tsc is the smart,creative  character?
Bro just when the imaginary number s entered, I left math
What is the giant symbol at the end?
Why I hear car sound? 11:19
*¡ÉPICO!*
alan can literally take one of the most hated subjects and make it look interesting
If this was the real maths I would have studied it harder then gaming XD
Everything in this video is a math simulator.. but there is one more thing...   EVERY THING HERE IS ACTUALLY INSANE!
The true number lore
The right way to learn math
Who let the man cook
I thought bro was in jail
8:25 Multiplied e?!
Woa😮
Por un momento me fascinaron las matemáticas jaja, que increíble animación, cada sonido le dio un toque espectacular ❤
Ok..... Its alan 999 iq?
The + end = "to be continued"
Can tsc be my teacher if he teaches like this
This vid thought me more than my even math class
It's canon?
The world's Best math video
Genius
the definition of perfection:
How to teach the funny math
This video reminded me of how complex math really is, it isn’t just.. numbers, symbols, letters, and shapes, its a lot more then that, it really is fascinating.
Did you notice the similarity in the fight between tsc and e*? It reminded me of the 1st movie: Minecraft vs animators where Alan fought tsc for the 1st time. Only with this difference now tsc is alan and e* is tsc. Tell me you don't see it.
do animation vs math II where he gets calculator
Early in the video, we found math As time goes on, it gets way complicated. Some of us didn't survive the fight, but some of us like orange here manage to defeat it and work together. (mathematician) or people same level with Einstein.
Dude was so amazing!!!
bro what
Amazing
the fact that a orange stick figure understands math better than me…😭
I have no idea where you study, but how much do you know about math..!? How smart?!
I like this dimension. It's interesting. It gives power to those with knowledge but also is just an empty void without you to fill in the blanks. An exciting concept that can give new inspiration! The concept the animation and the sound design. Are all really superb and show how the Alan Becker team has really good synergy. It's all fit so well like they meant to be. A God can enjoy this.                                 -Your online reviewer
Bro mi cerebro
How did it turn to 1+1 to this
Awesome video
this is fire!alan
School in Ohio be like:
Math lore
That was... weird. Good, but weird.
This was amazing! I remember struggling at math in high school with all the x=whatever the hell you want it to be.   You've seriously outdone yourself Alan. We all appreciate the hard work and time you put into these animations. ❤  2:49 *Never divide by 0.* The music got scary as if reality was going to be destroyed.
Just one word: EPIC
So maths can also open other dimensions gate
for when an animation vs Terraria
I don't understand anything but, orange / second coming, he is a super human capable of solving complex operations almost impossible smarter than all of us. PS: he knows everything because of his big head.
wish math could be as fun as in this video
9:52 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
Imagine this was all desmos
Bro just became the strongest person in Alan becker again
This was extremely interesting how we just see a stickman reinvent math and fight with it. This is a true work of art.
Me when I'm on wave 60 on cod zombies: 8:36
This is such a random concept and I freaking love it. Props to Alan
I dont like maths but this video and the way it portrays it makes it very interesting and creative
monkey discover fire (colorized)
I never knew math could be dangerous 😂
😂😂😂😂another amazing animation tysm Alan u are the best
I was expecting a black hole when he divided by the forbidden number
The math are never go epic befor this animation. 😶
7:25 my math teacher vs me
The e comes when the second coming did an error or unknown result
Only Alan could come up with such a cool idea and execute it so flawlessly. What subjects could we see next? Animation vs. Language? Animation vs. Science? Animation vs. Music? I wanna see Green fight a treble clef
Meth
Great video Alan. I will tell my math teacher about this video to see if she like it or not😊
Te mamaste con esta animación Alan muy good aprecio tu trabajo sigue asi
Bro made math interesting
bro just explained somone fighting math from kindergarten to university 💀 no way bro learned more then me in less then 20 minutes
Alan Becker out here casually dropping bangers every few weeks
awesome video!, great sound design!
My brain broke in the first 5 min of the vid.
Math 3 coming in clutch watching this
Alan: **makes an "e" Plushie**
I can't believe it all starts with 1 + 1 = 2
Gua ga ngerti Tapi tonton aja
Nothing can convince me that Alan isn’t the best stickmanimator
That was crazyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
22 миллиона подписчиков, Алан хорош 👍
1+1 = 3 👍
This is by far the best video ive seen this week. Everything is done perfectly the math, the animation, the music, it all fits so well. Even the story is good, with no words, no sound but sfx and music but it it still a masterpiece. Thanks for this Alan. (I understood the math until like 8:46)
13:05 Can anyone explain what does the last equation mean and its connection with dimensions? How can I use it or its components in math?
Love it
OH MY GOD THERE'S AN ALEPH NUMBER
MATHS ETERNAL
11:05 DEATH STAR?
nice this must have taken a long time
I like the fact how Alan turned 1 + 1 into the greatest battle ever.
How the fuck did they manage to make a LETTER so expressive?
This absolute legend just made math look fun. Do you have any idea how hard that is?
I love math it’s easy to learn when you have a good teacher
too much math for my dum brain
THE complexite of the math in 1 video
as someone who has a love-hate relationship with math, this honestly blew my mind. did i understand much of it? nope. was it cool? hell yeah bro, keep doing what ur doing  Best + Wishes + :)
Это полный рофлс
Can't wait for every cool math teacher to show this video in class for years to come
Is more complex than my math homework
When will the animator vs animation episode 2 will come out?
(⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠) ni siquiera yo sé tantas matemáticas 😅
if math lessons are like this everything would be simpler
This doll has mastered math
This battle probably went through my head whenever I took a math exam.
This Orange(Math) is Overpowered That it can beat Everyone In the series so far
Genial
I dondt understand anything but is cool
Who knew an animation about math would be this good!
π e
Alan may have written math instead of meth
damn that's the coolest thing i've ever seen
Very creative.
Everyone would skip bunks if Teachers teached like this
i would've loved if he did  the+end  and then  the+end=the which means end=0 as a to be continued
Hi
wtf math lore
AAARGHHH MY BRAIN IS NOT BRINGING ANYMORE
no one asked but everyone needed this animation vs (insert something) episode
10:02 I was the "WAAAAAH" for me. It was tiny but mighty❤😂😂😂😂
God the soundtrack is magical, sounds like something you'd hear over the speakers at EPCOT
It's funny how it goes from just a simple number to basic addition and subtraction to *what the hell am I looking at*
School just ended yesterday for me, but I just can't escape math.
You can even combine numbers in an epic battle worthy of the cinema
Bro if this is how I learned math I would love to go to school
a socking discovery 👁👄👁 this is much more complicated than the math ik, so much work must've been put to make all of the numbers and stuff ╥﹏╥ real huge respect for alan and his team (I forgot if he had one ._. forgive meh)
This needs to be added to the curriculum somewhere :) not only is it entertaining but it demonstrates how all this complicated math is connected, there are multiple ways to get to the same answer, and that many equations are grounded in these beautiful conceptual relationships. Amazing work!
Bro learned what took me 13 years in 13 minutes 😭
4:54 Arrow LOL broked SYSTEM OF MATH?!
my favorite part was when he tried to divide by 0
Bro this video is AWESOME!
Hooray orange itself, mathematics can no longer be taught.
pov: you are in the final math exam
-Зачем мне занать математику, она мне не пригодиться в жизни! -Ну если ты попадешь в подобное измерение, то пригодиться....
If math was like this, i wouldnt stop exploring it
куча уроков математики  ❎❎ одно это видео ✅✅✅✅
Great
Ok now we gotta get some teachers to review the video and let us know if this helps learning.
i didnt expect the Aleph number at the ending there, that was a surprise. Very cool video. Super entertaining!
amazing ➖➗✖️
4:47 Sword of math
Animation vs Duolingo pls, the spanish comunity have a lot of memes about Duolingo
The creativity of this man is amazing
Damn the fighting
Nan.. 1÷0=inf
Amazing
My head :💀
from minute 5:36 I stopped understanding something, what a really good animation
nilegreem would relate
Make a series of math vs animation  and part 2 please 🙏🙏🙏
Noo its my nightmare💀
Это очень круто!
5:24  now we know that orange is 1.5i times long which is imaginary still
Algebra turn into a algelore
Very cool, though you definitely lost me about 7½ minutes in xD
Up next could be a new series based on Mario Kart or the sequel of the wanted episode
Does anyone know what the last formule converge to?
This is confusing lol😂
get your "before 1 million views" ticket here
perfect
I want to see Animation Vs. Music next.
This is an artistic and mathematical masterpiece, i love it
The first time I am glad I am studying math
wow two of my favorite things put together
Moral of the story: Dont leave your calculator on.
I never thought id see someone animate an e running
I was lost when it talked about the negative roots and radius
Did Alan plugged a texas instrument this time?
TSC's way of making friends: not friendly? beat the shit out of them until they become friendly
Math is my favorite subject
Good game
Everyone know 0.5 +0.6=0.11 😅
Your very smart and talanted
Alan what the heck did you make that was the most extrem and creative video you made  I hope math teacher's will use your video in their classes   A master pieces 🙏✨️✨️
Yep, math would have made sense way faster as a kid with this.  Also, very well done!
ik most of this stuff
I am ready for my math test
If school was like this people that actually like it
Want part 2 please
💀 no entendi nada
I enjoyed it, and it gave me a headache. I love math and I've been out of highschool for a while so I've forgotten some stuff and was trying to re-learn it by watching this. Then the letters started coming into the mix and I was like, "Naw, I'm good here."
Sick!
wow thats really creative, using the laws of maths   as weapons and imagining how they work in a maths universe
ඞා
He be doing math I don't even know
Nasa using math as a weapon
Aprender matemática com a escola: 😢 Aprender matemática com o alan:❤
can you do animation vs reality please
Is this math or is it cosmic coding in reality this stuff is amazing
alan becker is my favorite math teacher.
That was mind-blowing!
This was amazing
Ok that cool but where ep 32 and part 2?
Wow a very wonderful video please make a video about Python programming
Yay! New video!
Yeah I gotta get back to doing geometry lol
Omgomgomgomg!!!!!!!!!! I just saw the preview and it’s amazing, also I bought all 9 of the plushies keep up the good work Alan becker!
The cool part about this is that is so accurate! For example the 2+2 arrow that shoots 4, the geometry, the trigonometry all of it is perfect!
Second coming be like: IMMA FIRIN’ MAH LAZARRRRRR
ALGUM BR Vendo ISSO???!!! INCRÍVEL Alan BECKER IMPRESSIONANTE.
Toughest battle yet
7:56 this is how much i know
4:10 the war lol
._.
What kind of mathtransformers I missed at school … 😢
Alan you some how made math watchable. Round of a plus
Alan nunca decepciona 👏🏼 Este hombre está en otro nivel
I thought orange was just the sleepy head
NOOO I CAME HOME LATE
short verrison : the second one coming gets kicked out of his house to become doctor
This is surprisingly mathematically accurate and I love it! You really went out of your way with this one! Hot damn!
So this is how they discovered these operations
Ayo
Yay
Это самая стильная драка в мире !
10:02 weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I loved the part where TSC said “It’s math’n time” and made equations all over the place
It feels like you're in a math simulation and the music goes well with it.
dude that sound that the 'e' made was i don't know
The Stickman learned math in less time than me haha
Thank you so much for making this video alan, i now know that putting numbers, symbols, letters all together makes a deadly weapon!
And I thought I was in advanced math.
why did orange end up here?
Nerds would know what all of this means
As someone who is in sixth grade this is very interesting and brain numbing
словил спойлеры на математику
I can't believe we didn't get a reference of 9+10=21
This is good. It's amazing. It's given me a new perspective on math
Huuuuge leap of faith! I love it
No soy mucho de matemáticas pero este episodio estuvo increíble una segunda parte estaría muy muy interesante
Lol broked math
Amazing
genial pawer up locos con matematica, unico xD
a
Magnificent
thats awesome video mann
Meth
i wish i could learn math that quick like TSC did
Why is orange there only
Great, I'm struggling with math, thanks, Alan
Holy cow, I think I love math now.
the ultimate math class doodle...      but you also have to take notes for the class
Bang, izin ngambil klip videonya
Can't wait for someone to do a "mathematician reacts to"
who would have thought you can animate math ! you can call this genius work 👍
It's genius
Omg my first I don't understand mathematics
Wow
Nah, this animator need to be my math teacher
I understand half of this I’m im 12 and In year 7 Britain
if theres a "the + end" then there will be a "the - end"
alan never fails to amaze me
I would love to see another video like this but it's Physics
i'm just going to guess that they other sticks trapped them in a calculator app
*MATH*
This is truly top tier animation. Mad respect, Alan.
Can’t believe I got to be in this animation (4:53)
That was intense bruv
2:50 got me dead😂
Que es eso pe xd
So this is what they mean when they say you might need math in your future
You better believe that this will be shown in every good math teacher's class from here on out
great
Einstein would have loved this 👍
hay algo que este joven no haga bien?
We are waiting for physics :)
THATS THE AMONG US SOUND WHEN "= 2" CAME OUT IT PLAYED THE AMONG US SOUND LMAO
I’m a mechanical engineer and you still lost me a couple times, but i was surprised how much of this made sense! Awesome work
Respect 🙏🏻💗🫶🏻 it's amazing
You lost me at negatives
My brain hurts
How on earth you manage to make me sympathize with e
Dude somehow managed to make Math interesting and cool within 14 minutes… give this man a reward, a medal, and 10 million dollars!
Мой мозг на матеше:
if only i could like a video more than once watching TSC arrange the numbers is so satisfying..
Nooooooo bro is doing math! I just got out of school yesterday!!!
people learning math's be like:🤔
What happened to TSC after AVA 6-
Thank you for this now I know math 1+1=11  Like if I got it wrong Comment if I got it right
How did The Second Coming end up in the Math Dimension?
Just like "History of the entire world i guess" i feel like this is a video that everyone needs to see at some point
IQ200
Wow ❤😢 10000%
This is so good🤯
that stick man need be in the war + lol
I loveed It! I loved It! Please! More Math! Your content always makes me smile!
The number of views turned from 500k to 770k in just 15 mins wow
As a man who sucks at all things math, I can agree that dogs are better than cats.
Animation vs Science next ???
This will be the reason I like Math if my teacher taught me like this.
It speaks to Alan and his team’s talent on a number of levels that they can even make me feel sympathy for Euler’s number.
I really love this video it just it's just so amazing how far math can go and seeing it is cool in the video!
What was that in the at the end
Did orange just made the death star?
Так точно показать всë это гениально при том все началось с обычного сложения
This is incredible
Increíble! El mejor animador que conozco
Rating= 50 Million quadrillion stars
I feel like I am watching someone play Minecraft Create Above and beyond
this is what we can expect to the new animation vs animator, I really tought this was the next part even if is non related to, it was so awesome to watch and the music giving me a feeling of suspense and intrigue, keep the good job :D
Wtf i just saw
The legends back
when creativity and math collab :D
Amigo tus videos son mejores que muchas películas de hoy en dia te mereces en Oscar (⁠ﾉ⁠◕⁠ヮ⁠◕⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠*⁠.⁠✧      👇
i love you
Wow + × ÷ =
i am in grade 4 but i understand all of this stuff
Euler number is in everything!!
不思議やなー
tbh you lost me at "I", but very dope concept nonetheless!🔥
Petition to show this video to every math teacher on the planet
If we continue like this, eventually we'll get Animation vs. Real Life
This animation is so good (June 24, 2023)
I haven't notice math is actually a hard yet fun thing to discover
This word... It's... the alphabet? 13:45
The + End = xD
Tengo que aprender los calculos con letras😅
Can't wait for teachers to show this in class
do the next science
Bro is teaching math faster than the average teacher 😂😂😂
This is the power of math in this dimension and is possible to do if you are smart like orange. I wonder if yellow would be better cause he’s the smartest stick man we all know!
nice!
Math be like:
He is the best animation I've ever seen. He takes normal things and turns it into animation. That's how you know He is talented
New series?!
This is the most thrilling video I've ever seen in 2023.
Nothing more action oriented than math.
Alan after making this video: breins
They should use this in schools. NOW.
yeah math is so confusing i also love how orange just...used math as weapons
As a math abandoner, mental illness is likely to come (sorry)
I learned more math from this than my entire semester this year, where I took 4 types of math in courses.
I think my brain has commited suicide
Que te fumaste
The question is... HOW DID TSC GET IN THERE
What the hellllll
se lo mostrare a mi profe de matematica
Pov : ur brain imagining ur a genius
Bro made a new Transformer Movie Episode out of Maths lol
4:33 its a smart and cool moment😮
Transformers: Rise of MathBots
3:39
My head ga dem
How it feels when you’re learning math and letters start appearing:
hey why didnt i get this for my math
That's fire 🔥🔥🔥
I know 1thing for sure,the animator was a maths topper
This single animation did what most teachers failed to do, Teach math in a fun way that still makes sense. Amazing idea for an animation, can't imagine how long it took to use logical calculation and formula's for this to be accurate.  Once Again, Amazing work!
我小時候要是有這種動畫我也不至於不喜歡數學，我想在學校看到的就是這種東西，而不是45分鐘坐在椅子上看老師解公式，我感覺我以前在學校都白讀了，現有教育真的要改，爆炸無聊
I’m confused that how the second coming get there in the first place? It’s probably like backrooms
The real question is how did he even ended up there
"And that's what math is used for"
absolute masterpeice
I didn't know interacting with numbers would create such satisfying sounds.
The understanding of this video is immaculate you can learn so much in such short moment this is probably his best made creation theres probably not a singular video which summarizes like this so easily and creatively entertaining and the fact that many things we just memorized instead of learning the actual thing why  and how it happens which was potrayed so beautifully
Dude, i ain't smart enough to get all these
Bro got bored in class
Beautiful.  Epic.  I loved it.  I think my favorite part was when the integrals started happening.  Reminds me of my calculus days.
Siiiiii
진짜 천재인가?
This animation is great
10:00 ronin fighting a pilot with a charge rifle
Wait is this canon to the main story??
Lets just stop talking about the animation but, how did orange went there?
everyone on their math final
never knew someone could make a subject that I hate so interesting
Somente aplausos!!!! 👏👏👏👏
Now we know why math is the most dangerous subject
Wow
bro became a genius in 14 minutes 💀💀
Bro made the Math Star
I wonder how mathematically accurate this is
My mind is blown
This was posted on my bday!!! 🎉🎉🎉
This is what the little man inside your calculator sees when you start typing random stuff in math class.
Who knew math could be so interesting
and that is why I don't do math
I'm one of those who doesn't know what's going on in this video but still watches anyway
Honestly, I would love to see this as a steam game like a zombie defense game but you have to use equations to get weapons and gain points to buy factors.
My Brain Be Like: Loading......
Он узнал больше за 14 минут в матиматике и алгебере чем я за 10лет
100/10 very epic
P.S  Dont let orange into the calculator he'll make nuclear weapons
I like how i actually learned something
thank you alan becker i now learned math
Dam i only knew until 7:20
This was the most badass use of math in animation I have ever seen.
Best math game
i lost to many braincells after this
a videogame without graphic assets be like:
8:24 when bacteria are losing to the body
Get this man out of my calculator
I beg for someone with the math degree (if that is the capacity of a math degree) and the knowledge to make a game, where we fight enemies, start easy with integer then decimal, formulas, and to destroy an ennemy, nullify it, collect mathematical expression, use an equality to aquire new number and stuff ( i stop before making an essay)
This is very cute Alen! I still hate math though.
I didn't get more than 4 minutes of it, but it was fun
Примерно на 3 мин. Я перестал всё понимать! Пипец и это всё мы будем проходить в старших классах?
dude made math cool what the hell
I was hoping that I would see zero divided by zero make something crazy happen, but all in all this was very amazing, very creative.
I can see math teachers showing us this video in the future. It's entirely possible. For Grapic Design, our teacher showed us the very first Animator vs. Animation video. And wanted us to see if we could make something similar. That was basically our biggest semester project.
i feel smart for following 80% of what happened
To be continued?
There's so much of this I didn't get. Like, what's f(•)? Why does ie^iπ open a portal? Isn't that just -i? What's θr, and θ/r? What does 2n=∞ mean?
Merci. Incredible realisation !
what
nekcst time do animaition vs cartooms
i dont really like this, dont get me wrong this animation was stunning but it felt empty unlike the other spinoff animations like animation vs youtube animation vs mario and those, this feels polished but forgettable. I alteast expected yellow to appear since hes the smart guy but this makes me and my other alan becker fan friends feel like we want to click off a primere for the  first time in forever, im not saying this is bad but this feels unusual and off topic, way more than the other animations such as the ones i mentioned, this is arguably the most forgettable since EP 13 this video is just not my type.
Alan Becker is the man who is able to make the impossible possible He made math more fun than epic fights!👍👍👍
When this video teaches you more about math than school does.
At the end of my high school journey  I understood all
As someone who took honors math classes and ap calc ab before college, the fact that I recognize almost all of the signs and equations in this video is both cool and horrifying
Math like this is entertaining
This man Alan Becker makes actual magic. Never in my life have I seen something quite this creative
That is a great vedio if math's like this I would pay attention
Sheesh
this is nuts, following you since first animator vs animation and you still makin top tier stuff
Best video of the century
Bro mastered math in 14mins
The sound effects and .... EVERYTHING was just AMAZINGGG. This is y I get told off. Coz u watch this and I don't do my chores. Tho love you
I didn't understand anything, but it's awesome!
Bro went from saving the block world to fighting with numbers 💀
i i'm 5th grade and the last thing i know about math is porcent (this thing %) bureven with that i love the video
Relaxing sounds
This should seriously win and award!
Alan Becker, you have done the impossible: you have made me enjoy math for 14 minutes straight
Ya no quiero estudiar matematicas
This is so amazing!! Although I do keep thinking TSC is gonna fight with like every single school subject there is right now... that would be cool but may not happen.
You broke my brain at 3:21  like WTF IS THAT?!?!
My brain had a stroke when it saw all of those math equations
When i wake up i whatch it and i was so confused
math before psychological trauma
math is easy for Mr
justo para mi examen de supletorios.
1 +1 = 11
this was masterfully made, I can’t express into words how well this was created
4:53 soy el único que le recordó al episodio de el increíble mundo de gumball,dónde Richard juega calculadora y junta esos números para supuestamente hacer un arco y flecha XD?
"He's beginning to believe"
that was amazing the next one can be sonic the hedgehog 😲 good animation and the sound effects were like in the future math cofusion😵‍💫
What's the next fight? God himself or what
i like owls
Cool math video 10=10
I'll send this to my math teacher
at first it seems just a simplification but then you add it up and it becomes a complicated EQUATION
This is legitimately the most creative animation I think I have ever seen. Fucking bra_vo._
Only Alan could make math THIS cool.
The most educational stick figure animation I've ever seen
I hope this will be a seasons that animation vs math
Nostalgia ..
Anyways keep on going alan.
Fucking brilliant as always
MY BRAIIN 🤯
1+1=🐟🐠🐡
Bro literal survived division by zero😮
Estranhamente esse foi um dos vídeos mais inteligentes que eu já vi
Да, с математикой надо сражаться, ведь это - ящерские технологии для убийства русов. Ох уж эта мать Атики!
This is one of my favorie stickman animation mainly bc how smooth it is
Just what do you have against e?
stick figure VS math problems (great help to teach math)
WHAT IS THISSSSSS HE JUST CREATE ANOTHER MASTERPIECE
Jesus, I can't even fathom the amount of work it must have taken to put this together. Outstanding!
Honestly, i wish this viedo could be viewed in actual school's
KEEP GOING!
ALLLLLLLLLLL STUDENTS TO SEND THIS TO EVERY MATH TEACHERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't wait for the sequel
now I wanna make a calculator like this
There is no way that someone managed to animate more than 14 minutes straight of what goes on in my brain.  11/10 my dude, we always love it.
i love the style
This is amazing because i like math
what the fuck, my brain is exploding
4:47 Its resulting 0 cause they are fighting 1-1  OH MY GOD EVEN THE SUBTLE DETAILS
This video make US to know if math ITS fun
I've never been more interested to have a headache in my life.
ooohhh sssooo cool i love it❤❤😊
The Second Coming Has No idea How Math Starts With 😂
Animation vs. 118 Elements  I am waiting for this :)
you should do a series where each time a new mathematical concept is explored ! how cool would that be ?
Bro became a mathematician In 14 minutes 💀
ah so this is the true origin story of noita...
Orange learned more math in 14 minutes than I did in 14 years
Now i know why we. Need to learn math even tho u don't wanna be a scientists
its alef א
beautiful just beautiful
Ep 2 please
This is elon mask
Who knew math could be so mesmerizing-
I was waiting for 0/0
it was very good bro congratulations
The math professor: Oh yes, now this is what a call an animation
Math is too op...
goooood animation
Teacher: don't worry the math exam will be an easy  exam:
We need part 2
Complexo
this video actually explained me why division by zero is impossible in the simplest way possible
The best math movie ever
There’s gotta be teachers showing this vid to kids
An awesome video! but don’t know why it’s awesome
cool😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
AvM is which? Animation vs Minecraft or math?
I think I actually learned something from this
Yay new vid
I understood math more here than I do in class
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
I love this
Making off pleaseeee
This will be more Awesome to watch if I know Math😂, 10.10 video + animation
if only math was this cool
Bro made calculus into a 14 minute action movie
POV Mum: Your homework would have been done by now if you hadn't have complained about it for this long.
finally
こんな感じの数学の授業ならいいのになあ
🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
Bro turned Math into a full blown avengers end game movie
good class from mr orange
Me on Desmos:
The amont of knowledge of math and imagination used in this is outstanding! And using all the knowledge it turn it into a animation masterpiece! Awesome job Alan!
Basa tempo
Orange and the math and savages fr
i love how “-“ just turns you around
I wish I could learn math this fast...
I love how that the e^i and TSC start fighting in a way that resembles Sticks, the hand game. Really neat reference!
Это ШЕДЕВР
i love how it just started with the most simple operation, and it became more complex as it progressed, amazing!
Wow, this video very interesting...
I learned more about math here than actually Calculs
Fighting his most vile enemy so far....Math!
When this video starts whipping out calculus, that's when you know things are about to get real.
And they said math was easy.🤕
1+1 2
Can you pin this for no reason
How am I learning more here than from school
what is 6 x 3 = ? 6 x 3 =!!! 6 x 3!!!!
I want to show this to math teacher
This is so smooth though
Someone: math is so boring and uninteresting, I want epic fights! Alan Becker: pfffffff, easy😎
i studied 12 years math for this yeah finally
Best 14 minutes of learning
I'll keep calculating angles in degrees no matter what. Just don't get the rad system
Everybody: mad with math Alan Becker: *I'm about to do what's called a pro animation move*
I seriously never thought of math being this interesting. Calculus was always boring for me, and now I see it in a new perspective.
Учим математику за 15 минут со Вторым Пришествием
me trying to figure out if i should pick C or D on the multiple choice question
I dropped out of a class because math in university was too hard at a certain point. is that what people call ptsd?
Damnthis will help alot in Math not gonna lie
U did it! U made math look cool! Finally. Defiently gonna try draw som stuff like this is my math class.
Alan Becker's math teacher must be proud
how to learn math in 14 minutes
woah I never seen math like this
The greatest enemy yet Math
I need more
e:waaaaaaa😊
8:45 my immune system trying to cope with the shit i eat
I struggle to even do double digit addition.
Now DJ is a pro at math.....
Damn this is so cool
Spectacular job! Really loved how math is represented! The music and sounds are also so good! Alan and his team are really the goats!
What am I looking at? That was the best way to get math across in the coolest way. The best math animation I've ever seen. Can I have some more, please. 😀😁
ทาสีเล็บเจลวิธีถอดเล็บให้หน่อย
Aleph at the end is beautiful, btw being able to understand all of this is fantastic... as fantastic the animation is.
I'm to retarded for this kind of thing-
this is so awsome
bro taught me math faster than i can go to my classroom
The animation was awesome, but my head hurts from all the math
Making god's work on this one fs and even made it feel complete too.
2:58 when my teacher runs out of solutions in math problems:
i only now 25%
Astonishing 👏
WOW
yo its my two favorite things
Alan Becker progressed us through Preschool to College Level Maths in only…14 MINUTES?! Wow…  *Petition for Alan Becker to start a school.*
Did anyone else get a Martix vibe when Orange was testing out the numbers to understand math.
Im surprised by how much i recognized watching this. I remembered enough to know why most things were happening. Great video and a great visualization of math
10:34 this stick man did the impossible and made the death star, using math!
Me trying to keep up with what's going on: ".......why does everything smell like copper?...."
Wow
I'm stupid af,,I'll admit that,,got lost after the first part with the basics,,,still tho,,,it was rather entertaining. Good job and sparking the joy of learning in the hearts of ppl
Я больше узнал про математику на видео чем за всю свою жизнь
DID THE E JUST SAY WAAA!
nice but braindamage
the ,,e's'' scream was funny xD
Alan How did you not become a scientist with this informations ?
bro made math in to an Elden ring boss
This is how your brain feels in math class.
:/
why is it so satisfying?
What the hell did i just watch
Imagine the "enemy" featured in this video was actually something that alan hated when he was learning math. Music is just beautiful, as a fan of kaijus, the x in the background made my heart feel so much joy.
I LOVE IT 💕 thank you so much
Alan actually made math fun
Orange the More intelligent
Behold the impossible! A math-based arms race!
calculator
Awsome! Это просто огонь! Всегда хотел разобраться в этой тематике, и вот свершилось!
Orange is like a math master
You can make game of this
They made me not good at math. Feel understood and smarter (can in my think. . .)
😮
Even with such a well done and fun video I can't like math, sorry 😔
The power of MATH!
Once again Alan can make a series with no dialogue, and can also make Math look so interesting.
Only Alan could make math a cinematic masterpiece
Was that the golden ratio in the end?
what the hell dude ?! this is super creative ! i'm watching it again
What is that kind of e
Cool, Alan Becker!
I have no idea what the hell i've just watched but i don't regret
wow that white space means imaginary number that's crazy
Wow!!!
You shall do next is Animation vs. Music
that was smooth when he hit him with the ball 8:16
2:47 bro made the biggest mistake, divided by 0 noone can do that that's illegal
Me lo suponía 14:00
Las matemáticas son poderosas 😂
Tell me Alan Becker is asian without telling me Alan is asian.
The fact that an ad shows up at 4:51, right before it hits 0 is impressive.
very good better than a math lesson 6969%
Lol 100k views in 3hrs
9:14 Me on the math test
I'm don't like math
This should legitimately be shown in schools, so much unique intuition for basic concepts in math is shown here
i love how the story of this video is basically just: TSC: "can i be your friend" e: "no" TSC: "NO I WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND"
We are waiting for the second part, where the stickmans will go into three-dimensional space and get out of the monitor.
What happened next?
I always knew that math was evil!
жду арты с e^i*pi
Даже математика в руках Алана смотрится шикарно
Fr
Im a little mathy. So this struck all the bits in my heart. I loved it.
Jaja let’s learn this way
Im a best Math. U know 234% +2 +(1^2) = 9
If this becomes a game, it would be the best math game ever.
my math couldn't keep up about 9 minutes through
times 0:44
shout-out for that one person that did all the calculations for the video 💀  (By the way the subtle fact that the bow is a "2x2=" equation and shoots 4 that is the answer.. the person that though of that it's a genius )
I learned more things in 15 minutes instead of 10 years
I love these videos
THIS IS AMAZING
j'aime bien ta chaîne je la regarde depuis deux ans
By far one of the most fascinating animations ever. CONGRATS!
I love how it ended with the aleph symbol.
10 minutes ebot?
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Woah. Now THAT Was *Epic* .
Жду серию с физикой❤
i hate math
Круто😮
man im in 2nd grade and i only learned x and + and -
The fight between SC and the e reminds of the fight between The Choosen One and Clippy
Bro actually went from 1+1=2, to going back home through some sort of teleport mechanism made by math. In just 14 minutes.
Wow sungguh sangat membagongkan atau membingungkan
ok ok, be honest, how many mathematicians did you need for this video?
Mientras lo  veía   yo lo narraba  porque  conocía   todo  lo  que  hacía  la  exponencial   jaja  la pelea  fue re  buena y  conocida  (ámbito matematico)  jajaja  lo bueno  de  estudiar  ingeniería jajaja
I don't understand math but this is so cool. I wish I knew how math works just so to understand the concept of this animation!
In which a pre-algebra student finds Euler's Identity on the internet and DEMANDS the teacher explain the simple looking thing.
10:03 el gritito HAJAS
from 1 to a giant robot fighting a big bubble that shoots big lasers. thats just the best video for math's fans
This is so much more math that I can handle. I can't even understand this it is a lot how can you animate math like this omg❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😅😅😅😅😅😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
cheers for your all effort to learn math for this video...
I love you so much
Alan and his team never disappoints 👍
es lo mejor que he visto en mi maldita vide   segui asi alan becker 😁😁 divertis a mucha gente con tus videos
Hay humo saliendo de mi cabeza ahora mismo.  Increíble vídeo! ❤❤
The+ end=the+final+end=x
hmm i wonder where is tsc going?
I didnt understand anything once we got to the e
Why does the e looks similar to the animation vs animator episode
After multiplying by power I got lost, but then when the pie and circles came in, I understood but then after that I got lost again. This was amazing even though I didnt understand
Thanks, now i can resolve my math test, alan becker best.
Math is surely everything.
He has all knowledge a stickman can learn… he is to powerful
@Alan Becker did you have a sound track link  I love the sound effects 😊
1:43 Vixe😅
How did you know so much MATH, HOW
Im 15 and i didnt even understand why you couldnt divide by 0 until i watched this video. I guess anything is possible when youre on youtube
Matemáticas hijo
THANK YOU Alan Becker!!
Me trying to figure what is happening
Behind every -1 there is a e^iπ
Is every animation vs_____ gonna be improving each stickman abilities?
TSC relatively understanding until letters come along, and then being angry at letters is such a mood to be honest
I LOVE IT
Dude make me learn about math in 14 minutes
we learn math in just 14 minutes
THE ANIMATION WAS VERY CRAZY
We need part 2
I will be good at math after this
He made math entertaining how is this possible
"Math can either be your best friend, or your worse nightmare"
Thought this was going to be a 3b1b collab
But keep making vids like these I love them
Omg Alan wow I like the maths 😮😮😮😮😮😮❤❤❤❤❤😂😂
BRO
Very good the video !!
7:34 *sigma moment*
And he’s just broke reality
I was lost after ⅓ of the video 😵‍💫
imagine a game like this
8:29 wait, what, how?
OMG THAT WAS SO INTERESTING but i dont understand most of it cuz i am only 10 so i dont know that stuff :(
So it kind of made me chuckle because the background number at the end is I’m pretty sure the Hebrew A with is Alef and in the Hebrew alphabet their silent they don’t make a sound so it made he chuckle seeing it invisible (I completely forgot that in Hebrew the alphabet is also their numbers, it’s interesting but also confusing) 😂😭
That's why this video took a long time I am still surprise they managed to learn everything in a month
He just picked up math like it was a normal Sunday for him
i never knew math could be fun but somehow you make it
Now I want a video game about this
Bruh 1+1=11
oh my god bro i'm still in the eighth grade, it's this math that makes me dumber than anything, i felt really dumb next to the orange stick
10:36 Bro we just went from maths to obliterateting it
Any Math teachers here? Show this in class, and record it!
OMG this is awesome
Don't mind me.. Just sending this to my Math teacher rq.
How did i just understand almost everything in this video while i cant even process whats happening in my maths class
Hmm
I'm confused with math but that was so cool
I am vietmanes
I can imaginate the next video will be animation vs sciences or literature (o literatura en español )
You broken YouTube stop!!!
This is the only math i like
Best of 2023
Это невероятно, музыка эффекты, математика, Alan вы гений очень понравилось
Your videos make me want come to school again
im learning a lot more Geometry and Math than I did in 10th grade
2
As someone who hates Math, this is the most relative thing I’ve seen.
I swear that it is the most beautiful animation you made in all of your career  and outdid yourself❤
It’s confirmed, alan is reincarnated einstein
DAMN!!!!!!!! THAT WAS FIRE 💥
Literally what I see when we gotta do math
if stickmen were better than me at math i would explode
bro this is so sick
Will there be a possibility of a part 2
Math at the void
I like the BGM.
They have so much precision to be able to perfectly make pi just like that
Absolutely need to see SC utilizing these math powers for future battles
Okay, I love it
As an not mathematics, idk what is this
Random thought, but the portals created by the Chosen one resemble the portal created by the E maths thing, relation?
This is one masterpiece
man the stickman is smarter than me. How could this be bruhh
very very cool
dude this is so complicated and your animations are so insanely sick!!! keep going!!
Argh 😩, My brain is overloaded 😅😂
finally, the animator found someone who can go toe to toe with the one, the negative one who is completely irrational and imaginative. Love it❤
i don't understand 2/3 of all this shit but i might learn something from this
I WANT MORE OF THIS MATH VIDEOS!!!!
Amazing!
OH NO THAT'S TO MUCH NUMBER
Added Ω is are lot ∞ is in behind of Ω added ok plsssss
Bro This Video İs Art And Alan Becker İs Artist
Tony stark discovering time travel:
How teachers explain how to use maths in real life
I am 100% that the universe taught me math just so I can understand this work of art. I hallucinated with your work, thanks for having done this
Only Alan Becker can make an epic animation out of MATH.
Why is this the most confusing  and entertaining video ever?
This is even better than math with phonk music
Wow
Genius bro
i wish math lessons are like this
I like how Alan didn’t go for a “Brains vs. Brawn” approach, and instead just made a fight to the death with math terms
13:45 Question: why is the letter "Aleph" (the letter of the Hebrew alphabet, which almost merges with the black background) so GIANT? And why is it not the same as everyone else (I mean it is not white like the others, but in the form of the color of the coordinate plane)?
NEW VIDEO NEW VIDEO AYYYYYYYY
数学ってすっげぇな...
TSC understood maths better and faster than I did, there's a lot of references an equations that I don't understand
Awwssoooommeeeee 🤩💖
ε ζ η θ  Σ π ALL GREEK ALPHABET BABYYYY
Я так и математику выучу :)
It’s summer break, calm down
estaba durmido
I LITERALLY THOUGHT “bros gonna make pi” AND HE DID
I feel stupid now after watching this. I need to start relearning math again. 😆
Hellooo
Alan Becker is over here making award winning sztuff, while Disney is making another live action reboot. Keep on animating!
Shut up!!! Math people
This is awesome......
cool
What are you going to start working on season 6
NO ANYTHING BUT MATH
Good god I'm too stupid to understand this absolute masterpiece!
As a math lover, I am amazed by this. He captured the beauty and complexity that math has in a 14 minute masterpiece. I love it.
What's up from Malaysia boy!!!!!🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾❤❤❤
someone pls explain what happened at last when our character go.    everything is clear in this video only the last part sucks
bro's more smarter than we thought, W orange
math is awesome
Ok……………………………………                Mmm M                                       What the hell infinite doesn’t it? 1:06
WILL WE NOT QUESTION THAT HE DREW A PERFECT CIRCLE
Hello♡
ALAN BECKER POSTED A NEW VIDEO, and its still a masterpiece
I always hated math but this video showed me how awesome it is... thanks Alan 😁
Seeing mathematics through these eyes was really cool! Man that's amazing!! 😭
1000000000000000/10 amazing editing and all that
Alan could well make the universe of music the stick figures in the universe of music like sheet music and etc...
this is why i like math
Kids:math is the worst subject ever. Alan becker: ok I will teach th- Kids: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The best thing is it correct!
Now that high school math class is so helpful, and it makes me think again, Allen really makes us experience something different.  He is a true treasure.
너무 재미있고 역시 대단한 사람
The Start in till the end. I don't done enderstand anything
The school Math's whiteboard when you turn away for 2 seconds
Wow! When I was a kid, I like to imagine that math equations like something that I can "drag-n-drop" them and see what the other side of the equation reacts. Now, it's very satisfying to actually see what I've imagine to see when I was in that time. It's really a great job Alan's Team! I don't know that I really need to watch this.
Bro what happened the episode 2 😮😮😮
cool
Abi çok güzeldi❤❤
Me playing with my calculator:
I feel like I understand math a little better.
thats some insane level of high scholol math that my middle school brain cant understand
Why did I wake up to MATH?? And why is it actually meaningful?
I do not have the patience to animate numbers bro
This video will blow UP!!!
This could be equal to "if math had boss battles."  Edit 1: The Span({x1, x2, x3, x4}) = R4, simply, means "How many dimensions does this type of vector have?" In that case, it has 4 numbers/elements, so it would live in 4-dimensional space. Everything else I got right away: R/Theta - polar coordiniates (calc 3) Sqrt(-1) --> imaginary/complex numbers (alg 2/trig), e^(i * pi) = -1 --> special case of Euler's equation (e^[ix] = cos[x] + i * sin[x]), and e^(i * pi) = sum(x = 0 to infinity, (i * pi)^x/x!) (Calc 2).
I lost you halfway through... What on earth is going on here? 😭
The power of math
Maths will never be the same
Eu... Me sinto tão burro😅
He literally broke space and time😮
complicated methods, yeah.
Imagine if math would be this
This is the most entertaining video I've ever seen in my whole life but lmao my brain stopped working throughout the half last of the video. This somehow also encouraged myself to learn more math XDD
Imagine learning math this quick
א
when you OD on adderall
This is a best video in Alan Becker
so insanely cool. Those clever and unexpected interactions, like the equation expanding to make clones of itself or the =f(x) gun, are the best part of the AvA series and the fact that they're still new and fresh after so long is incredible
Top
What is this
I’ve never been more content to learn math
이시대 최고의 유튜버
This animation is crazy and I like it
I even have the idea for next animation: Animation VS Undertale
what in the transformers was that? (9:50)
Bro what kinda animation
Math is good for the soul
I don't understand much, but I know it's epic!
Now this is some math I can pay attention to
I need more of this, exploring the complex, the imaginary numbers, and the infinites
…
Cantaloupe
Math doesn’t have lore:The Lore
As a math lover (not nerd), this looks cool and i want second part
Is this related to the previous eps
Hey Alan, I know how are you put other games in new animations and I was wondering if you could do a game called terraria I just wanna see what you could do with it I know you have other projects, but maybe in the future???
Who would win in a fight: e or herobrine?
I love it so Who love the animation like
The sound design is jus ear candy, holy crap
Nice
If only I knew as much math as the silly orange stick figure 😔
אתה יודע עיברית?
Incredible!! I love your work so much!! No one can make a math video that hypnotizes viewers and makes them like math, except Alan Becker. Great job. Genius!!
A lot of math goes in this animation
3:50 начинается высшая математика
Omg this is so cool
10/10
Math homework:watch this
This stickman learned how math worked so much faster than any human. It just goes to show how intelligent they are. They are curious about the world around them and incredibly fast learners. Edit: at a certain point it reminds me alot of starwars. Edit: wow the world of math is weird. no wonder i cant learn it all.
Today is also my dad's birthday
I don't know why but it made math fun
no words can describe how amazing this masterpiece is, indeed
Oh I just know math teachers are gonna be playing this in there classes
Math = pain Math + Alan's Creativity = actual pain, but a masterpiece
Bro just taught 15 years of math in 14 minutes
We’re running out of ideas. Fast.
me me me pls math
Next animation vs code
Can we all just appreciate just how good Orange is at adapting? I mean, at first he didn't even know what the fuck 1+1 was and then he was making fucking the fucking BFMG (BIG FUCKING MATH GUN)... This guy is just adaption incarnate!
You should do animation vs baldi
this is summer break. math is unacceptable.    ... this is an exception tho
3 hours.3 HOURS
Please bring the animation vs animator 🙏🏼
We need Alan as our new math teacher
I need help please. I am having a LOT of trouble finding the Ambiguous Triangle. [a=30  b=40  A=40°] I found that [c = 46.099 B=58.987° and C=81.013°] What is the next step in finding the Ambiguous Triangle?
2:52 not what I was expecting I am surprised that the place he was in didn’t imploded
Conclusion: Learn math, it will bring you incredible wealth. (maybe)
I'm going to study math like my life depends on it just to understand this video completely
Me when I see math questions.
"Hey Strange! You know what's cooler than magic? Math."  ~ Peter 1, 2024
Part 2 plz
my brain hurts
nah e is a menace to society
EPIC❤
Eu só vol falar uma coisa parabéns 👏. É incrível ok você feis, é geleam, eu repito parabéns, 👏.
Bro just taught me more math then my teacher ever could
İts too useful and funny video for math 😂
uju the animation was very funny
holy this is way more entertaining than it shouldve been is this sequel after minecraft one?
You made the impossible, you made math fun
Wow, in this video, my brain was this: 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯 Only thinking about the time to make this art, You need in this video like 500k likes.
Damn I think I saw "Absolute Infinity" at last
We can finally prove that math is EVIL
Wow
What was the huge X symbol at the end?
me and my brother where excited when you posted a new videos :)
As a prima math hater, I think I like it now
Злой учитель математики разгромил оранжевого дрыща 😱🤑🚛
I wonder if Orange is going to be really smart now.
I like this video not gonna lie
this is what happens in my head during math class
This is actually good
The best way to learn mathematics, this is a work of art, follow so Alan
Wait all that are imagination? I don't get it
I don’t know anything about the math that was used here except for the multiplication and simple stuff like that, but it was epic
Funyy wlord😊
never knew I could watch a math video longer than 1 minute.
Video maker is so genius in math.
Alan was mad at math.
the only way to make math fun:
If this doesn’t become an instant hit I don’t know what will  This is the most creative math story I’ve ever seen
Bro learned advanced trigometry XD
this sound design was top notch. The music felt so appropriate for this weird dimension, and the sfx for all the math clinking and plopping felt like it was exactly how math should sound. absolutely stunning.
Finally, some fun uses for math
Negative and Positive
Это круто даже если это просто по фану
This is what it’s like to be in Tony starks head
Fue La Cosa Del Matemáticas más Increíble que nunca Vi
It was really awsome....
🥲
Math: The Movie Starring: TSC by Alan Becker  Coming soon.
When I said I m scared of Math This is what I meant
We've decended into chaos
졸라맨이 나보다 똑똑해
2023神作
This is genius. Wow
Próximamente: Animación vs. Music
This is the most enthralling math lesson I've ever watched
Îs fire❤
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS GAME!
As if infinite + infinite you may think its the same but its actually 2x infinite so if were like i Tt                    e   then if you plus them by multiple it well turn things to a bigger problem now. ĒO is a portal as infinite And S are the same...
You know what? I would love to see TSC teaching me Mathematics for real.
This video makes you love math :)
That was... bloody brilliant. I didn't know that I needed this in my life, yet i'm happy it's here.
Bro is better than Elbert Einstein in math😅
man i hate math but after watching this .......................... i still hate math but this video is awesome
The orange stickman is literally me when study Math (but more confused)
Alan pretty much animated the "Math is power" logic, thats how you do it lmao
This is teaching me better than my teacher did.
QUEEE QUE ESTUDIO EN OXFORD O QUE
This is crazy... (in a good way obviously)
Orange is learning
good
Sound design is mind-blowing as always.
This might be the coolest thing I've seen this year
Math never fun like this.
Algo anda mal aquí 1 es matemáticas 2 está solo 3 el vídeo es muy largo algo tiene que pasar 2:00
When the tsc is being smarter than me in just 14min-
the entire math in 14 minutes
“Dude i just had the craziest dream”
You just earned yourself a subscriber!
Yo solo se que   muchos   vergazos   y putazos  y  cosas que explotan  entendi  muy buen  video me encanta 😊
If my math class has these power, then the whole world will be under my feet...muahahhahhahah
im so confused and amazed
still couldn’t understand anything, but great video bro🔥
Make a series for that? Maybe?
This, is a Elon Musk
Idk how he made the worst subject into the best. Keep up the great work Alan.
Math is easy. Math test be like: 10:00
I need 8 seasons if this... STAT
Bro actually made math fun 💀
These sound effects are on point, great work!
I was here, I like math.
Alan you def should start a math teaching course
A+
That world would be a dream for yellow
Now THIS is what I call a COOL MATH GAME! 😈
Dude this video is a masterpiece.
Into simple math, turns into complexity that made math a literally a war zone.
The only thing missing now is logarithms and natural log
genial
bro i have no words to express the awe I'm in, alan you truly are a master at what you do, massive, MASSIVE respect for you and you awesome team.  Also, my theory is that somehow, orange accidentally fell into alan's calculator
We need a vr game where you can explore and play with maths like this and you can have aboss mode and a peaceful where there is no bosses
So we saw how it is The + End. Will there be The - End?
My braincells are slowly dissolving.
Bro drew a perfect circle first try and seem uninterested 💀
Всю математику за 15 минут рассказал
how did we go from 1+1 to pie? i can't keep up, this is complex
super fun and interesting
actually the most entertaning math video i guess
Bro I was just thinking about math xd
AND YOUR TELLING ME IMA HAVE TO LEARN ALL THAT!??!?
Wait wow! I’m pretty early!im early to this master piece!! (Btw I accidentally disliked while trying to like but dw I liked )
This is the math teacher we all want
I don't think anyone realizes that this makes orange the smartest out of all of them
ALAN IS BAAAAAACK!!!
This is video would be the best teacher of math
Basic math to advance math.
Addition, Subtraction Multiplication, Division, Pie, Summization, Radius, Square root, Exponential, Sin, Cos and Tan, Fractions, Decimal, Measurements and Algebra
This huy learn More maths un 15 minutes, i leen the dame thing en 12 years
학교에서 이거 샘한테 걸려도 볼수 있을듯 이제
nah bro this aint geometry dash this math run💀
pov: you are finally starting understand math
MY HEAD
Very VERY impressive but I’m still waiting for animation iv 2
Biblically accurate math
"Well, apparently, you can not divide by 0 or else this happens"
The animation was mind-blowing but my mind stopped working after   i
(1=1)
that Alath null at the end
Orange learned more than me in my elementary years in 14 minutes
Can't wait for high-school math teachers to start showing this in class to try to be hip with the younger generations
I learned more in this 14 m video then my 8 years in school. also it was keep up this amazing work :)
It's a good thing I studied alebra calculus
Umm ok?
oh my god this is awsome, the crafting of weapon formulas is truly amasing
Ôi giải tích😢
Amazing
Be  my maths teacher ☠️
I am currently studying for my math finals, and I think it might be a good sign that I managed to understand 90% of the video. The other 10% are parts of the subject that aren't taught at my level.
Orange learned domain expansion through math
G(64)
WOw
Literally showing the magic of math, this is beyond amazing!
10:02 Made my day
Love this....sophisticated sick shit🔥🔥🔥🔥
4:45 HELL YEAH NUMBER SWORD FIGHT
So...
Alan Becker is one of the only persons who can make math interesting to watch
So clean animation
I literally just woke up and this is the first thing I see, I’m happy
Buenisimo😮😮
you have never brought out the nerd in me so hard before
Wait until he finds x
imagine how much math was done behind the scene
My brain is exploding
This video shows orange's true intelligence and strength mid-combat to learn every single move that the enemy will make (Btw, he is still in base form)
we finally figured out why we needed  to learn algebra, our teachers were preparing us for something like this...
Who knew maths could be this entertaining. Alan is definitely the best animator I have ever seen
OMG the animation in this is so unique and smooth, and is just amazing to look at. Please keep posting! We love your videos.
BRO THS SHOULD BE PLAYED IN SCHOOLS ITS BETTER THAN THOSE RANDOM BORING THINGS
Of all the things I have ever enjoyed, I have enjoyed this the most.  I don't always bookmark random internet things... but when I do, it's of math.
currently at 0:13 and. HONEY WAKE UP ITS TIME FOR MATH CLASS. lol *edit* 4:14 ok so this s where the problem comes in. Nice
Man if only Geometry, Calculus, and Fractals are shown it would been so much cooler!
I freaking LOVED Aluph's cameo in the end
who can never think that sin cos tan graph become a death star
wow just wow...
Omg This is Awesome Alan, this deserves more attention and stuff  Edit: I was here when there were like 80-90 comments
If orange have that power (Math power) he will powerfull
This is absolutely wonderful! It has awakened feelings of inspiration, awareness, and a deep connection with knowledge or truth. It also evoked a sense of liberation, contentment, and a heightened state of consciousness. I feel as if I have understood all the mysteries in the world. I offer my profound thanks for making this. Please make more videos like this in the future.
MY MATH TEACHER WANT MORE ANIMATION!
I just completed my partial math course and this video has so much nostalgia in it. Some of the math I didn't recognize tho, i guess there's always more to learn
This thaught me more things in 14 minutes than in 4 years. Conclusion: Alan Becker is a better mathematician than anyone else.
I love how you dont need to understand most of the math to understand this
The stick figures here, math geniuses
Orange is hacker
we went through into elementry - mid - high - college in 14 min
I love math now
But but.. school just ended :(
Do an animation vs languages
My god, this is so good
A stick figure is smarter than me 💀
what is e^iπ?
Absolutely Amazing!
As a Engineer i can enjoy this animation pretty much. 5 years at University finally give me an exclusive joy.  Like the first time, someone type 5318008 on the calculator
😮😳🤯
someone needs to make an actual simulation with this features
You really did the hard work, way to good man. Math (My Favorite) + Animation = Awesome Epicness.
Good ending
Dreams that Einstein had !
LOVE THE THING!
Who knew math will be this much fun to watch 😂
As a Math nerd, THANK YOU SO MUCH. Not only is it entertaining but a lot of what is being shown here is mathematically accurate (EDITED: to some degree, for the sake of entertainment). I can't stop smiling watching this because I know people who don't like math will at lest have more interest in math because of you. THANK YOU.
This video proves how creative and smart TSC is as a character
Math genius
I'm a bit torn, because on the one hand I'm happy to see a video of Alan Becker almost every month, but I'm sorry that these videos type "postpone" the other episodes of the series AvA VI that I wait a lot, on the other hand I'm happier that brings different various content (first AvA VI, then AvM s4,  and now a "Stand-alone" video, and Actual Shorts at the same time)
this video shows that a stick figure learns math faster than me
I wonder how orange got in that world in the first place?
Petition for  e^(iπ) to be in smash bros
Desde ahora me gustan las matemática por Alan XD
Educational and fun at the same time. I would take these math courses in a heartbeat.
Alan proceeds to explain why 2/0 is undefined
Next: Animation vs chemistry
Он вычислил его по IP, лол he figured it out by IP! (iπ)
Some concepts in this video if you want to learn later: Elementary functions, Peano axioms, Euler's formula, electromagnetic wave, hyperbolic functions, Taylor series, linear span, gamma function, zeta (function), phi, aleph.
The real AVM
Even a child who hates math can agree this is one of the coolest films ever 😂
The+End=Part2
He comes up with the most random things, like what he did right now, no one has thought I bet u, he's just cool like that
1+1=3 xD
next up we gonna have animation vs countryballs or something 💀
Bro taught me more than my Algebra teacher 😂
Alan es un genio 😮
we need this in every math class
I genuinely need a part 2
Unlike my math classes, I liked this
If this doesnt classify as a motivational video for people who hate math, idk what is
How the fuck can someone make Math Epic and Badass!?
alan becker's vids always finds a way to amazes me
Para los que decían que las matemáticas son aburridas
Math now not so boring
Alan don't need an oscar...       *the oscar need him*
I’d love to see a mathematician dissect this video.  On top of that, I always love how Alan Becker shows his characters discovering and learning about new things.  It fills me with wonder, especially here.
real math
people tend not to understand why numbers can´t be divided by 0, Alan´s just shown us exactly the reason why
Who knew math was this powerful
이 시간에 보고 있는 한국인 손~!
0__0 no entendí na xd
If only math was like that
what
they are literally things that I have not seen in my class but they entertain me
1:49 bro became G-man 😶‍🌫️
Animation vs Entropy next
Un hombre demostrando sus habilidades
1+1=11
What you think about dark souls?
Also jesus christ second coming singles the hell out of so many god like beings in media with the power of math Like goku, saitama, power of love spider man, darkest knight batman and etc So watch out powerful characters throughout media cuz here comes "second coming power of math"
Math be like:
Where are the other stickmen? And why isnt he in the any of the original servers?
My brain hurts in the best way.
i got lost at the point where they had a half of a squared number
Looked awesome, and was probably mathematically correct if I could have understand it.
i love math (even tho im bad at it its just fun)
What i retain of all this : never mess up with the exponential x)
this  is the best masterpices of the time its just amazing
Best music using ever
*Baldi would like to know your location*
O no another chapter ad in maths you are my maths teacher
TEACH ME MATH LIKE THIS
Well, now I know I forgot nearly everything about Math, my brain is burning hot. Amazing video tho x)
Math sure is intense.
Never thought math could be an enemy for a stickman.
You Did A Math Video In Summer Vacation
ы
👍🏾
This is unreal, what a bizarre and creative animation
this is the coolest thing I've ever seen that I cannot understand
Bro became Euler in 2 minutes
Necesitamos que un profesor de matemáticas realmente experimentado reacciones a este vídeo y explique las partes donde se muestran las matemáticas más avanzadas y qué eran esas formulas del final xD
Only Alan Becker knows how to make an engaging lore based story with only math. Keep up the good work man! :)
I kind of want to see a mathematician to react this and explain the numbers to me lol
my head hurts😢
I’d never have to take credit recovery if math was like this.
I love this animation and how much of the math I understood.
Mano que m**** é
is god😎😎😎
that was amazing how you used math to create an amazing animation!
Как из человечка нарисованово в паинте и математике создать боевик на 12 минут
when math becoms a fighting game:
I hate the fact that I can literally understand everything in this animation. That's some really good work
The best math focused video I have ever seen! 🤯
It took me a while to figure out that the other side is imaginary because you need i to go through it 😅 awesome animation though!
E vs orange
Desmos coming in clutch!!
1+1=5
I don't like maths😂
You made the best video  In the whole world
The fact that I knew more then half of what all that ment.... fml
very good i like a new viedeo
When Animation vs animation part 2 ?
Etiqueten a @dateunshort para ver que opina
Ngl I feel like I understand math more
Ojalá las matemáticas fueran hací.
Nunca decepcionas haces cosas muy épicas
Cool what you can do when you know your "limits"
this is some superliminal type stuff, im loving it
This is why we went to school
There's no way he just made math look fun
Yellow might be able to figure out math quickly since he is so smart.🧠
only some ppl know theres Terraria laser music used in this😂😮😮
that is not math, thats a meth overdose
1+1=11
БОЖЕ ЭТО ПРЕКРАСНО
We will never know who is the real |e 9:00
I like how it doesn't suggest any controversial theorem to be true while at the same time having a vast amount of toys to play with.
1+1=4
my head hurts now
El conocimiento es poder lo pienso:
e^iπ aint that powerful i guess
Animation vs numberblocks this will be epik
I wish this could've been in irl
The only thing is scary abt TSC is his knowledge and how he puts 2+2 together
wow i didn't know math could be so cool
That was so epic ❤❤
I struggle to compute the huge amount of imagination of this channel. Truly one one my favorites, very easily !
My god, this is incredible, math-nerd matrix with our favourite stickmen. Not a math spec myself, but I am sure Alan created everything with accuracy.  I wonder if there will be Animation VS other subjects, like Chemistry or Physics maybe.
This is how pure mathematicians feel at their job
Lets talk about for a minute that.... How did the second coming end up here? Its clear that he woke up one day and ended up in the void. How? And why?
LET'S GOOOOO
I thought orange is trapped:/
It's amazing and wonderful how a human with a stickman, math and a little imagination can create such an amazing animation
What they teach in class 0:20 the test 9:55
I thought regular math classes were hard to understand, but this is ridiculous!
Amazing
Impressive How It Goes From 1 To Complex Equations
Orange against Algebra. This guy can make an epic stick animation about anything.
As a math major, this was basically how we delt with most math in senior year.
As someone who is learning statistics and probability, I can confirm I have 0 clue on what these maths are (except the basics maths of course)
Bad video
Before 5:00 it is pretty understandable. But after that I don't know wtf is going on. But awesome work as always, thank you Alan.
So in school we learn that dangerous subject right?
Oh so cute to continue plss???
That one guy that understand everything on the video using this in real life.
Damn im learning while watching😂.
I never been that happy to had learn maths
I am Confused xD
the aftermath wasnt that good
10:02 made me rolling
I did not learn anything from this
math lore
My last neurons fighting in math exams be like:
Alguém me explica quem é Matt
Who knew that =f(π) was so powerful
This is very beautiful video ❤❤❤
Dude just indirectly made me wanna become a math major
It's not an 'Animation vs.' video without epic fight scenes
Imagine if Yellow was there.
Someone get Khan academy on the phone
Chapter 2: linear algebra
Three words in RL I Hate Math But animation's made by Alan I love it
Who knew that alan becker would explain to me my entire school year of math class from basic math to algebra. I dont even understand the rest
Why am I having fun watching math?
Alan is just a genius. He was able to add war even to mathematics!
This is how math class should be taught, from kindergarten to university. 😂  Not that euler’s identity is a bad thing tho
this is the best animation I have ever seen in my life keep up the good work!
I never thought math could be so entertaining to watch-- I'd really like to watch a part 2 to this!!
leave it to Alan to make math cool.
I never thought a story could be told through numbers. You outdid yourself Alan.
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Was that Godzilla sized monster at the end the Legendary world destroyer 'X'?
wow nice animasion minecraft
Brain ain't braining anymore😢😢😢
Math teachers be like if you blink while they're writing on the board for 00000.01 milliseconds:
Now that we covered math, lets do Chemistry!
math lore:
Thank you Alan for this banger! This is why this video is so beautiful. I've never seen math expressed so concisely and so creatively. Just as the identity e^(i * pi) - 1 = 0 looms in the background, we also glimpse into math at its core. First, addition. Then, subtraction. Then, multiplication and division. Then, exponentiation and surds. Then, imaginary numbers. Then the complex. We move onto the complex plane (honestly, using transformations in the complex plane to move yourself around the math space is damn creative, and heck of a combat moveset if I've ever seen one). Then, we get circular functions and the unit circle, and seeing how pi, arc length and radians are introduced is damn clever. The sine and cosine weapons are especially potent.  The fact that this approaches hyperbolic functions and other identities of e^(i * pi) is clever, and the way of expressing just the immensity of infinity and trigonometric functions is genius. I mean, we even got a sneak peak at set theory and beyond (in the span stuff, and with the massive hidden N set at the end when gathered with the universal set, phi, and delta).  Please keep doing this - there's so many more fields to explore, like calculus, matrices, functions (including polynomials, logarithms and exponentials), algebra and even vectors. I'd love to see a series on this, and maybe even have the math symbols potentially influence the Animator vs. Animation storyline, because math and modelling physics is definitely a key part of the code that makes up the digital stick figure world.
We need a mathematician who can explain this
Mathematics is our future Alan created it 😮😮
he made the math movie
When a stick figure started a war with 🤓
amoung ous
The atmosphère
WTF i don't understand but that was amazing
This is actually an amazing way to show math and the understanding.
Most funny math video
4:42 Bro have the holly crucific💀💀
I am sad Youtube don't send me a notificación
Next up caucus
The sounds are so satisfying
It's normal that 666k views and when you go to the video 700k?
Richard Watterson ?
Epic
I know most of the math here even though it is complex for normal 7th graders
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾        Now I want a sequel, please 🙏 Am I the only one who think this is satisfying?
This Is perfect example of learning
so .......  my god
I'm scary
imagine if cavemen learned maths like this
Alan & his team + Death star + WAAAHHHHH × awesomeness = MATH
understanding allof the principles shown in this video make it so much better, it was really creative and was very accurate in mathematical terms
keren sampe tidak bisa berkata kata omagaaa😮
I never thought maths could be this fun
The way the music and animation is choreographed is so astral.   It feels like Im watching aliens interact in a whole new dimension with a whole new set of physics.  Absolutely amazing animation, and I have so many questions as well.   I really loved the process of e teleporting Orange away and then e's friends of certainly more alien proportions appearing.  It all is just so cool and odd, and I wish there were more things like this on the internet.
Ooow My God!!!!! This is incredible!!!!
animation vs war
Oh my gosh it’s June 24 and I don’t know this came out.
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
alan becker should do a netflix series do you agree?
Bro 14 mins of straight math XDD
this is the most entretaining math class ive seen so far
i never tought i would say this but math is cool
Is there a The-End?
The math we want:
YEAH BOIIIII
This is amazing 😮🎉🎉🎉👏👏👏
My experience the whole time: Uuuuh I don't know any of this...Oh wait that's pi, I'm such a genius!
Oh my God 😮😮😮
não tôi khi thi toán :)
What he teach us How to do addition Substraction Multiplication Division  Powers i=√-1 e^ i pi = cosx + isinx Graph of sin, cos ............... etc ......... What I Got  DON'T MESS WITH MATHEMATICS
I may not like math, but this is awesome.
I need mooree❤❤❤❤
omg this is so coll😃
man just went from maths to English
The could not comprehend most of the math button            👇
This is one of my favorites of his videos now
Aleph being a giant at the end is what made it perfect for me
I like the way he used technology sounds and looks of this math.
new video Mario rpg
we can relate to it 😂😂 by the way you Keep getting good Alan keep it up dude...❤❤👍👍
I got all the references!
I reckon Baldi should have made a cameo somewhere…
Just pure PERFECTION! The way the digits move, the creativity, OH I LOVE THIS!
This is why I hate math because it'll always find a way of hitting for no reason
I think we can all agree that almost none of us would have survived being in that space.
Tremenda obra maestra 20/10 y god
1+1=3
10:01 Math lessons be like:
Who says math isnt fun?
This is actually amazing. Animation is going to approach and get into a lot of fields of science and logic and other fields of study, possibly.
와 이 사람은 진짜 천재다...
I'm speechless!! 💝
10:02 my mans really just said "e!"
I gotta admit, I've never been more interested in math. Ever. However, where's the Geometry?
WOW Esto si es otro nivel 🤩
I feel like this has something to do with the Wanted series
What a fantastic adventure!  The secret, elusive corners of maths the most thrilling.
Nah that aint math thats meth 😂
Wow
??? Alan
I think I talk for everyone when I say "ehh?"
My bored brain during every math class:
The lore is now big we had found out that SC had the supper special mind White part is for imagination And the black part is for the reality soooo that means  After he fell asleep at the rockets camp SC brings a letter eye from its dream and used it to free the chosen one
This is the best episode i ever seen
mm.. orange s friends
I really need someone to make explanation about why only "e" that move and why other just move in the end of video
TSC's new talent: Math
Pls come to nepal to teach me maths (*´﹃｀*)
Calculus exam be like
*"How students view maths from an alternative world"*
RUN ORANGE BEFORE ITS TO LATE TO TURN BACK
Very cool
He just simulated 4d
Now who said math wasn't fun definitely not me totally
I think this was my favorite thing you ever made
Bro you should do animation vs science next
Where the part 2 of the wanted???😢😢😢😢😢
Man went through kindergarten to graduation in 13 mins
bro made math fun!
phải học hết toán đã r xem
me when I'm stressed out and my calculator is in my hand: 0:30
What was the big phantom ghost thing in the last shot!?!
Nah bro just made a death star at 10:29
make a part 2
nice video
Very good
Who knew that SC was the fastest mathematician 🧐🧠
Exceptionnel
this is so well done
How did this yt video have so much comments and views already
finally i don't need to watch the indian guy anymore  all i need to do is opening alan becker channel😁😁😁
13:46 Aleph!
Math, visualised
Now I like math
😮WOW😮
This is so cool!!! Seeing an abstract concept turned into reality through interactions with a digital stick figure really is mindblowing. Alan Becker and the animation team really can do so much out of so little!
You know what this whole math sequence is made me smart I'm no gonna lie
Teachers must show this to childrens instead of other useless stuff fr
Alan, no one in the world will ever be able to do what you do. You will go down in animation history, nay content creator history as an absolute legend.
Huh
One word : EPIC ! 🤩
I can’t wait for a bunch of math YouTubers to analyze this entire video and explain what happened and why. I’m just here for the pretty animations.
A New Journey has evolved from the Animation... Now Facing Math.
this is why i subscribed to Alan😎
E🗿
Its very very cool
Isso ficou muito legal, adorei a animação que você constrói isso ficou magnífico, parabéns alan becker 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
I love how he goes from the first math we learned at child age to the hardest part of math he goes at the end it’s like a history of you will to me
Oh, God. The pun at the end, that's a killer. I'm still laughing rn 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Random idea Animation vs. Music🎼🎵🎵🎵
Extremely creative, well done!
11:18 my favorite part
Fun fact = Where is friends 😂
The beginning of this video: Oh, this video looks kinda boring. It’ll probably be a puzzle video or something.  The end: HOLY CRAP THAT WAS INSANE
Lol
i love how at the ending all the "impossibles" just gather together and leave even the aleph-0 in the background lookin all spooky
Wow that was truly amazing!
Math classes when I blink 💀💀
at 1:44 I thought he lost the answer and now he had to get it
It's funny how I know most of the concepts used in this videos
how did math allow orange to become a god of death
Now, the next is "Animation vs Draw"
На такой урок математики я бы сходил
Why did this teach me better than math
i dont get it
13,033th coment
Алан, я всегда смотрел на математику как на скучный предмет, но посмотря этот необычный видеоролик. Я аж сразу вспомнил многие темы
I learned more than at school in 11 years of study😢
That is provably the hardest one to make. EVER. And you freacking made it, somehow, and accurately ! You litterally broke math and made so much dimension that it became a ultra sphere. How tf do you want us to not encourage you after this ? This is just too good !!!
y'all we need AVM 2
bro i love the small details
Решил отдохнуть от математики, зашёл в ютуб, а тут это...
2+2=fish
Stay in school, kids
this hurts my brain
Это гениально, Алан.
Maths lore be like:
The ending with Aleph Nol was the cutest, which I never thought I would say about mathematical concepts.
For those who didn't understand the context of where e^iπ was going with the door way.   The one black void or dimension we saw was real numbers dimension and the white void e^iπ went was imaginary number or complex numbers dimension. Both are different from other so there was a wall between them.
como me gustaría entender matemáticas lpm
What? What happened at the end?
I bet Alan had to go back to college for this one
Gostei de +
Aprendi matemática
no puedo creer que Alan pueda hacer cualquier cosa, sobre todo hacer buenas las matematicas .__.
Bruh I don't understanding
めちゃめちゃ面白かった！！
Waiting for some youtuber to thoroughly describe everything presented in the video and telling how accurate each part of math is shown
👍💪
A part 1+1?
Cant wait until my math teacher plays this on a lesson.
The + End 🤣🤣🤣
YOU CAN'T DIVIDE 0
Hell yeah
Where's the sped up phonk
This is crazy!
Informatic here, from the half of the video to the end i dont know what is happening, but is amazing
Why learn math at school when a literal stickman teaches you
Taking math to a next level.
I not understand, only the maths basic
wow
U must have consulted a lot of mathematician for this
Animación vs calculator
as a math nerd, this video is awesome :D
Finally, a use for sin, cos and tan
This. Is a awesome fight ❤❤🎉
The fact someone had to do all this math is insane
Profesor las matematicas no son epicas las matematicas
Great work as always I’m just glad I understand some of this stuff lol
Calculator malware
Damn, I need a game like this. Seriously. It is VERY cool!
did i really just watcha whole 14 minutes of an orange stick figure do math
guess now we know, alan is a genius
My brain whenever I do a math exam

No WTF mi serebro ☠️
What, did i just watch
this is how to teacdh a 10 yr math

Your maths degree wont help understand alan becker vide...
Clarita la cuenta🤓
It all started from 1
as someone who likes math more in concept than in practice this is amazing, for reasons everyone else already said
Next, please give me an animation of the physics subject.
I always hate math cause I'm not good at it... But seeing this makes me interested in math again
And all of that was in the calculator..
he just made a death star made of m a t h what the heck
it's an epic battle of math I like when the end
Who else is here before 1m views?
Your animations are just kept getting better and better on the timeline. Keep on going, Alan!  Edit: how tf i got over 40 likes, but anyways tysm!
Ahhh mi mentee 😸
4:00 this is where I stopped
me when i was a kid: I love maths!  me when im 11: nah im forsure im failing.  me when im watching this video: 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
If Orange/TSC was a math teacher that bring the whole class in this dimension, I will never skip the math class again. I promise. (the promise is the lie, I still skip the class lmao) All jokes asides, this is the coolest thing I ever see in my life 👌
А можно химию
this teaches math better than my teacher
Bro turned math into a action shooter
most normal math lessons in ohio:
It all when perfectly but then its wrong at the last seconds The + End = The + End It should be The x End = The End. Correct me if im wrong
I need episode 2 of animation vs math because it's super fun
Mr. Alan Becker, thanks for making this video, now i have an excuse to ask the teacher to let us watch this in class
I wish my math classes had giant infinite π laser beams too
Incroyable, renversant, épique !
Math - the movie
Math would be my favorite subject if Alan was my teacher. Such elegant work, dude!
How many times i re-watched this...
The way tsc made word exit was unexpected one
It feels like im watching the matrix somehow, i never thought math would be so entertaining to watch, if all math classes were like this i would probably still fail but i'd enjoy it a whole lot more
So i dont know why i need to know this
*M* ental *A* buse *T* o *H* umans
I love this episode since im good at math but im in a competition against one of my classmates to depend who is better and if this is how teachers teaches all of the subject like this vid no one is going to hate school anymore
This video was too complicated for my brain 🤯
good video
the fact that alll the moves each and every bit like the bow the semi circle ... everything is actually true acc to  maths and is valid .. is even more amazing that it can also be shown in a way to entertain .. demn
My brains hirts witj the story  now☠ i only watch it because  alan is a cool guy that makes awesome  things
Dude that giant Aleph Null in the background at the end was great
That’s so amazing, he should do Animation vs Code and have them mess around with Python or something
What are the other stickmen doing?
Math: The anime
Essa e a prisão dele
Channel on next level ❤ Never seen much maths in one video.Anyway Super Cool 😊
Beynim yandı
Never in my life i’ve enjoyed math.          Until today
I don’t know why but the animation is this episode just seems so beautifully done, stands out from prior videos.
"Math isnt fun" Me automatically:
This video honestly wants to make me learn math more to understand it and a whole bunch of other things
Весь курс математики за 14 минут
This is how it felt during exams
2:48 💀
Hahah i knoww
I love this
Instantly my brain went wild 😂
WOW
This was the most epic and satisfying video about math i have ever seen
Elementary boys and girls:🤮🤮🤮🤮       The first man to discover mathematics:
Everyone knows π=3.14159265359
This man has made end game level fighting using math functions.
8 year old me playing with a random calculator be like :
1+1= stickman
i thought it said animation vs math but the a is an e
SO COOL !
Yippee
I'm going to show my math teacher this 😃
my teacher need to see this
Now I get it when people say knowledge is power
This gotta be something they show in math classes now, it goes over everything I learnt in high-school and beyond
How TSC started to learn math at the very beginning and in the end used high level math flawlessly, truly inspiring!
We need an animation vs word now
This its cine
Orange a died?
Amazing
How to animate the equation of life...
I never thought I’d see the day I’d find maths exciting
To Be Contined
eiπ
I like math so much, I like the video so much.
10:31 Can you imagine that The Second One defeats Victim like this in the next part of Wanted from Animator vs Animation 6?
Pov your playing on your calculator
is there going to be a part 2? I'm curious to see what the Roman numerals and aleph are going to do
I LEARNED MATH THANKS TSC
I wonder if Math can be useful to learn with Orange so far. Alan did a really great job for making this cool project so, so good after all.
13:40 это русская ф? \ is this a Russian f?-ф
Math is useful!
The weapons and attacks used in the battle scenes explained *_SPOILERS AHEAD_* The Second Coming used +1 and -1 to make a sword eiπ used -1 to make a sword The Second Coming used 2x3= to make a crossbow  The Second Coming used * on his legs to make himself faster eiπ turned himself into a Sigma Monster that shoots what i believe to be his equation idk im not a 🤓 The Second Coming used π*i to make a shield, and then  multiplied his shield by 8 to punch the Sigma Monster eiπ used an equation involving i to trap The Second Coming like a blackhole, but then the Second Coming used - to teleport himself to the other side of the equation eiπ turns back into a Sigma Monster  The Second Coming uses the sin of I to yeet the Sigma Monster, who turns himself back into eiπ, who decompresses himself into his equation, which gives him 3 clones of himself, who then follow the process, and the cycle continues. The Second Coming creates a =ƒ(•) gun The Second Coming uses the • on the i radius to escape, meaning he has to fend off all the Sigma Monsters By using the ∞, the Second Coming upgrades the =ƒ(•) gun into a =ƒ(∞) gun, which can shoot in an infinite span, as long as it isnt blocked by the i radius. the remaining es hide in their equation and literally turn into a Sigma Male and he gets an infinity staff from the infinity bullet *_B W A A A A A H_* The Second Coming uses numbers to move the i radius on top of the Sigma Male while he creates an e army. The Second Coming uses the sin and cos of the =ƒ(∞) gun to destroy the e army, and then grows the radius of the i radius using r, and utterly destroys the Sigma Male. The Second Coming and the last remaining e get sent to the square roots and use an i door to escape. The Second Coming and eiπ become friends, The Second Coming escapes number-land-void with an i portal. Then some other numbers i think show up and the end yay
Oh he transformed the stick figure into multiple little animated math stuff!
alan becker: orange you are the one. Prepare to enter the matrix
Animation vs Google plz
I don’t get it
that's some intense math right there, phew
I love this videos ❤
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Is it me or the animation is way smoother now?
This is a accurate representation of how a math test is like.
12:28 - "exit"
The "WAA" on e was funny😂
Bro orange just taught himself all the math I’ve ever learned in like 6 minutes lmao
I need a math professor to react to this asap
La profesora: presten atencion que esto va en el examen Yo pelotudiando con mi calculadora:
I wonder if there will be a next part
e Iπ
let me finish
Math is my favorite subject since I born, can understand a lot of things were happening was so cool. My dream is be a Math teacher and I gonna use this video certainly. Thank you, Alan, for this long video only of Math, is very good see people reminding a subject so hated
Orange got taken out of the equation lol
Bro teached me way more things in 14 minutes then 99% of my math teachers in 4years.
You are not only cool but also intelligent
Beginning of math 0:07 The first equation 0:14 Basic Arithmetic 0:20 2 = (1+1) 0:45  Subtraction 1:24  e^iπ 1:40  Multiplication 2:24  Division 2:35  Division by 0 2:49  Exponentiation 3:05  Square roots 3:40  Irrational numbers 3:44 Imaginary numbers 3:50   ie^iπ and the first fight 4:01  5:14 End of the first fight  Complex plane 5:36  Second fight 7:26 Sigma/Summation 7:35 e^iπ and e^-iπ inside of e^iπ 8:24 something 9:59 End of the fight and a new friendship 12:11  Orange leaves math 13:26             ???       13:30
diğer çöp adamlarla devamı gelsin
the only  thing i have to say  it   s just , amazing
That animation is so good
The giant aleph at the end made me laugh. Amazing video, Alan.
Alan made math my favorite thing in school
I would honestly use this video as my math learning
If this was a real game people could play, I would pay 50 dollars for it.
Why did Euler wanted the second coming and what was that giant thing
Alan took too long to make a video so full of information that I couldn't even understand._.
so cool
we finally found the x which is in every math problems😅 at the end scene its very giant but hidden
This animation Is what do you tink in the mat lesson
portal 3 looks awesome
Amazing, really weird how e just keeps showing up everywhere
Bro made 684,753 views in harvard (For Now) 💀
0/0=nuke?
i hate math but i love this video
7:35 Sigma 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿 Thats the symbols name
WAIT!!!! WE DIDN'T SEE IF ORANGE ACTUALLY GOT HOME OR IF HE GOT TELEPORTED SOMWWHERE ELSE!!!
Really cool way to visualize math.
Im learning math more from this vid than from my actual teacher
Watching exclusively this video to study for my trigonometry test and wondering why I got a 53
Bro, this animation made me understand math
İt is impossible to do
"So this is what extended Mathematics does to your brain"
I can finally do math 1+1=11
1:39 bro literally made primary school math into high school math using a few taps
Bro got it all wrong 1+1 equals 3
Crap, I think my brain just goes into 4th Dimension while i’m watching this video.
Teacher So is 1+1=2
If math lesson, my favorite subject
Bro went :"legalised nuclear bombs "at the end💀
for those of you who might be able to tell me what the name of the subject is from Eurel (e^iπ) friends?
If only we could learn maths like this 😂😂😂
I did not understand anything but his really styles
👍👍👍👍
bro is a genuise
He is making the world out of math
Oh my favorite
Interesting
NUMBER LORE!!!
Ohio?
İts so god
we want more videos like this, 0000000000000My cousin said this video is one of the best mathematical explanation video
Alan Becker, explotando y tentando el apreciar todo lo relacionado a las matemáticas, increíble cómo cada entrega.
Math would have been much more fun this way
I dont understand the final
My brain when doing a math exam:
WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS!?
the giant thing appear in 13:42 is a Aleph
Before its minecraft now it's Math
Bro turned math into a war
Omg
This is the best way to learn math!
holy fucking shit
Hey, is this math class?🗿
What are you bac +15?
So far what I can see is math can destroy anything that orange have fought
finally. a fight against my most hated subject.
pretty sure everyone's mind is gonna be about this video during math class after watching this
*THE MATH LORE*  0:07 The simplest way to start -- 1 is given axiomatically as the first *natural number* (though in some Analysis texts, they state first that 0 is a natural number) 0:13 *Equality* -- First relationship between two objects you learn in a math class. 0:19 *Addition* -- First of the four fundamental arithmetic operations. 0:27 Repeated addition of 1s, which is how we define the rest of the naturals in set theory; also a foreshadowing for multiplication. 0:49 Addition with numbers other than 1, which can be defined using what we know with adding 1s. (proof omitted) 1:23 *Subtraction* -- Second of the four arithmetic operations. 1:34 Our first *negative number!* Which can also be expressed as *e^(i*pi),* a result of extending the domain of the *Taylor series* for e^x (\sum x^n/n!) to the *complex numbers.* 1:49 e^(i*pi) multiplying itself by i, which opens a door to the... imaginary realm? Also alludes to the fact that Orange is actually in the real realm. How can TSC get to the quantity again now?  2:12 Repeated subtraction of 1s, similar to what was done with the naturals. 2:16 Negative times a negative gives positive. 2:24 *Multiplication,* and an interpretation of it by repeated addition or any operation. 2:27 Commutative property of multiplication, and the factors of 12. 2:35 *Division,* the final arithmetic operation; also very nice to show that - and / are as related to each other as + and x! 2:37 Division as counting the number of repeated subtractions to zero. 2:49 Division by zero and why it doesn't make sense. Surprised that TSC didn't create a black hole out of that.  3:04 *Exponentiation* as repeated multiplication. 3:15 How higher exponents corresponds to geometric dimension. 3:29 Anything non-zero to the zeroth power is 1. 3:31 Negative exponents! And how it relates to fractions and division. 3:37 Fractional exponents and *square roots!* We're getting closer now... 3:43 Decimal expansion of *irrational numbers* (like sqrt(2)) is irregular. (I avoid saying "infinite" since technically every real number has an infinite decimal expansion...) 3:49 sqrt(-1) gives the *imaginary number i,* which is first defined by the property i^2 = -1. 3:57 Adding and multiplying complex numbers works according to what we know. 4:00 i^3 is -i, which of course gives us i*e^(i*pi)!  4:14 Refer to 3:49 4:16 *Euler's formula* with x = pi! The formula can be shown by rearranging the Taylor series for e^x. 4:20 Small detail: Getting hit by the negative sign changes TSC's direction, another allusion to the complex plane! 4:22 e^(i*pi) to e^0 corresponds to the motion along the unit circle on the complex plane. 4:44 The +1/-1 "saber" hit each other to give out "0" sparks. 4:49 -4 saber hits +1 saber to change to -3, etc. 4:53 2+2 crossbow fires out 4 arrows. 4:55 4 arrow hits the division sign, aligning with pi to give e^(i*pi/4), propelling it pi/4 radians round the unit circle. 5:06 TSC propelling himself by multiplying i, rotating pi radians around the unit circle.  5:18 TSC's discovery of the *complex plane* (finally!) 5:21 The imaginary axis; 5:28 the real axis. 5:33 The unit circle in its barest form. 5:38 2*pi radians in a circle. 5:46 How the *radian* is defined -- the angle in a unit circle spanning an arc of length 1. 5:58 r*theta -- the formula for the length of an arc with angle theta in a circle with radius r. 6:34 For a unit circle, theta / r is simply the angle. 6:38 Halfway around the circle is exactly pi radians. 6:49 How the *sine and cosine functions* relate to the anticlockwise rotation around the unit circle -- sin(x) equals the y-coordinate, cos(x) equals to the x-coordinate. 7:09 Rotation of sin(x) allows for visualization of the displacement between sin(x) and cos(x). 7:18 Refer to 4:16  7:28 Changing the exponent by multiples of pi to propel itself in various directions. 7:34 A new form!? The Taylor series of e^x with x=i*pi. Now it's got infinite ammo!? Also like that the ammo leaves the decimal expansion of each of the terms as its ballistic markings. 7:49 The volume of a cylinder with area pi r^2 and height 8. 7:53 An exercise for the reader (haha) 8:03 Refer to 4:20 8:25 cos(x) and sin(x) in terms of e^(ix) 8:33 -This part I do not understand, unfortunately...- TSC creating a "function" gun f(x) = 9tan(pi*x), so that shooting at e^(i*pi) results in f(e^(i*pi))= f(-1) = 0. (Thanks to @anerdwithaswitch9686 for the explanation -- it was the only interpretation that made sense to me; still cannot explain the arrow though, but this is probably sufficient enough for this haha) 9:03 Refer to 5:06 9:38 The "function" gun, now "evaluating" at infinity, expands the real space (which is a vector space) by increasing one dimension each time, i.e. the span of the real space expands to R^2, R^3, etc. 9:48 log((1-i)/(1+i)) = -i*pi/2, and multiplying by 2i^2 = -2 gives i*pi again. 9:58 Blocking the "infinity" beam by shortening the intervals and taking the limit, not quite the exact definition of the Riemann integral but close enough for this lol  10:17 Translating the circle by 9i, moving it up the imaginary axis 10:36 The "displacement" beam strikes again! Refer to 7:09  11:26 Now you're in the imaginary realm.  12:16 "How do I get out of here?" 12:28 -Don't quite get this one...- Says "exit" with 't' being just a half-hidden pi (thanks @user-or5yo4gz9r for that) 13:03 n! in the denominator expands to the *gamma function,* a common extension of the factorial function to non-integers. 13:05 Substitution of the iterator from n to 2n, changing the expression of the summands. The summand is the formula for the volume of the *n-dimensional hypersphere* with radius 1. (Thanks @brycethurston3569 for the heads-up; you were close in your description!)  13:32 Zeta (most known as part of the *Zeta function* in Analysis) joins in, along with Phi (the *golden ratio)* and Delta (commonly used to represent a small quantity in Analysis) 13:46 Love it -- Aleph (most known as part of *Aleph-null,* representing the smallest infinity) looming in the background.  Welp that's it! In my eyes anyway. Anything I missed?  The nth Edit: Thanks to the comment section for your support! It definitely helps being a math major to be able to write this out of passion. Do keep the suggestions coming as I refine the descriptions!
Yoooo this is actually good
this made math my favorite subject
Wow tihs animation so cool but math😅,orange:super math teacher+ensteins😮😅
math in ohio
Математика-наука точная... И боевая. Если правильно ей пользоваться.
This was incredible!! The fact that I was able to keep up with most of the math even though I barely passed, especially the way e used a coordinate plane calculation to send SC home, that was so cool!! Did anybody see the gigantic faint x (I can’t find the right symbol) walking behind the other symbols at the end?
He must be very good at math.   Me when i watch until the end: my brain overheated
Summer: coming Alan Becker:MATH TIME!!!
is it bad im learning more from this than school?
The sound effects are soo nice
man i wish math was like this in real life, it will be sooo cool and fun at the same time
Bruh cos+rad=pi
Imagine understanding math from some random animator guy  But not in school 💀💀💀
Having Aleph-0 as the hidden super-monster is quite fitting  Because after everything that has been done, all the number that we have now, will have in the future, and possibly discover more in the far future, is inside the FIRST layer of *Infinity*  That.. is what Aleph-0 represents *Its SCARY. Rightfully so*
Don't worry, math can't hurt you. Meanwhile E^i*pi: hold my beer
This just reminds me of a xkcd comic rating math symbols on how good they would be as weapons.
This man never disappoint his viewers always come up with something special
1+1=2❤
It's amazing seeing all these things that I actually know from school. While I live in a different country and therefore the way I was taught the subject was different, I still understood most of the stuff that was going on. Will we maybe get a sequel, "Animation vs School" or "Animation vs Education"? It'd be nice to see all those subjects in a way that isn't boring.
Animation vs. Math next Ep.2?
The power of math
Thats the math lore peak
if i was a teacher i will show this before every lesson half by half
I just want that "interface" to do math
I like the animation and I enjoy it but it blows me away with the formula
This are Awesome!, wait orange its the orange of wanted or AVA iv
Animation vs math shorts
How to learn math in 14 min 👍
this so good moma
El grito 10:01 😂
great work alan, but i still dont like math
Seeing all of that, reminds me of how much I have problem with math.
The animation is amazing and the sond dising and the music too !!!
You could make a whole math animation about this
I wish I was smart enough to understand the abilites
Math is looking kind sick ngl
Sério que um vídeo de matemática me prendeu até o final? Esse cara me surpreende cada vez mais
Where TSC go to?
la calculadora segun richard de gumball
only genuis understand this
damn, the anim has less lag than real life
If this comment get pinned I eat a borgor
Bro, this is so Fantastic Brainy Episode!  I'm I the only one who's pausing the video just to solve the Numbers 😂?  Every Scenes My Brain like gonna explode, seeing something MATH problems
We need a Animation vs Physics next.
insert advanced calculus
Bro turned math into a fighting game
Dari 1+1 sampai menjadi "e", alurnya sangat keren, sampai sampai saya tidak faham
I’ve never been so excited for math
What was the big thing in the background near the end when TSO left
Coolest animation, most fun animation! I understood most of what was going on XD
This is literally how to learn math without being bored
That got more epic quicker than I toguht posible
Use planeland in part 2, PLEASE
Alan just broke the law of maths
very nice ending
I find it absolutely amazing that we went  from 1 0:11  To whatever this could be 11:05 💀
For once I actually paid attention to a math lesson!
11:14 MONKEY BALL
Your mind when you're bored at math
Our boi has discovered M A T H
wow
All I wanted was to eat chips and watch some animations, then all of a suddenI became an engineer
This is making me like math
amazing math lesson i won more
I wish I could understand all of it fully, I really want to. I am quite good at maths (in my class) and I know I like maths but I haven't learned about e, i, pi, and all the complex and imaginary numbers yet (for I am a younger audience of your videos). Now I got really curious because I do realise their flight is based on maths logics. What I wanted to say is thank you, for inspiring me through your videos and showing us your creativity.
I like the sigma symbol devil! That is very cool! I  haven’t ever seen it that being cooler than anything mathematics character!!
Who said math couldn’t be interesting?
e
2+2=5
this animation is just awesome, and so is minecraft. I'll probably seem arrogant on your part, but can I have an animation about Terraria? This game is simply amazing, and I advise you to play it too
Alan teaches more math in 14 mintues than my math teacher in a semester
Best math video on YouTube
bro the stick man understood math faster than me💀💀
When my parents learned math at school they had to fight the equations
🤯
This is the coolest math I never seen like that what a reaction
“You know what sine waves look like?” “What?” “The Death Star” -Alan and his crew probably
After watching this, I started  loving math
I had to stop everytime TSC did *something* just to see how had it worked. The accuracy and imagination is insane.
Me trying to do my exam of marhs with only 1 hour of study*
i wish i can understand math just like orange
1+1= 111
its perfect
What's 9 + 10 21?
super brain I love this animation
Lmao, Euler formula chase run
5:41 could it be calculus?
1+1=...a lot of
Stickman o-creator
man how did i missed this
Nah don't need background. Only number and stckman is enough to make it look epic
💀💀💀
TSC will bow before the might of Calculus
Damn it Im late to the stream :|
Tsc is gonna be A smartass
This is literally the Matz are Cool! Books and i LOVE it
WHAT THE HECK, IAM JUST A FIFTH GRADER. Amazing video, i love it, keep moving ( :
this is really cool
Dude just made one of my favorite subjects even better
This made math interesting
more learned then in 10 school math years
R.I.P Orange
Why does e oddly remind me of clippy
YOOOO!!! I love it! ❤🥰❤
Dude, math is so awesome
Bence çok garip bir video.
me in dream when i loved math:
This is the best and most fun Math class I've ever had!
This is awesome 😂
1+1 is not 11. It’s 2
This is freaking gorgeous! Absolutely mind-blowing! A master combination of math and technology, as well as the visualization of those formulae! So floored by it.
I've always wanted to see math represented in animation like this, this video is like a dream come true
what's the name of that giant symbol?
Might I recommend "Rythmetic" by Norman McLaren from the National Film Board Of Canada?  Which I feel might be some sort of inspiration for this short. It's from the 1950s but it follows the same principle such as the numbers being added and subtracted but numbers move on their own. Though it's much more basic than this brilliantly detailed short, it's one I come back to from time to time to get inspired to create any sort of stop-motion text demo reel or something. Also, it's quite funny to watch!
Why is this so satisfying😂
My brain and eyes hurt please send help
did he fall into graphic calculator app?
As a person who doesn’t sleep in math class, I can confirm that this is what happens in math class
Maybe we can call it " mathematic battle ".
7:34 The moment he became sigma
Animation vs animation vl2
Part 2
I think you just made my brain explode in every dimension
I never thought that a youtube video would teach me more than school🤓
Is nobody gonna talk about how good the background music is?
This guy explain me maths in easy way.
That one kid at kindergarten be like:hey you,if you smart whats 1+1=?     11? Like how am I suppose to know😂😊
can u do physic or chemistry
From the beginning of the video you seem to have set the y-axis as an imaginary axis so it feels a little weird for e^i*pi and TSC to come into a new imaginary space with a white background, but it still seems to have been a good expression most of the time. Well done
I want A math class like this
maths 🗿
Why did you have to remind me of the AP calc exam I took yesterday
e sigma
This looks like the future
It's just perfect
hello
Yeah i'm 15 years old and I  was lost as soon as it hit exponents.
Bro. I literally understood this math sh1t. Even I didn't understood when teacher taught us this
Alan is just phenomenal at his craft!
Awesome!!
Beter than Marvel
Nah bro make math like this i would be getting As everyone test
Bro just turned math, in to math lore
Everyone knows 1+1 is 11.
OMG
Hi
I wonder how much math does Alan has to research for this animation
9+10=21
math lesson is now my favorite subject
hi
At school sometimes I struggle with math. But when I watch this it makes me love math.
Okay I might be stupid by why does f(infinity) cancel out Eulars identity?
Aprendí más de matemáticas aquí que en el colegio 😅
YEEEEEEEEEEEES
I learned more math here than my freshman math teacher
The chunk I understood =1/7^(7^(7))
I like how he implements math into a battle
What is this amazing soundtrack called?
Surprised he didn't use the absolute power of 0/0
What's the music name
Everyone know 77 + 33 is 100
ALGUIEN ME DISE EL NOMBRE DE LA CANSION QUE SUENA DE FONDO
I didn't understand anything of what I just saw
i understood the whole subject w/ this video more, than with all learning years i went trough
Animation vs. Math
I like your funny symbols, magic man!
I wonder how he did all that math
This is incredible
와 진짜 개 오진다
welcome to baldi's school 😂😂😂
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💯×💯
I wonder if we'll see Euler and their friends again
This is what i call "Mathart"
Everyone knows 1+1 is 11
I can't wait to learn all these math symbols and then rewatch this again and see if it makes more sense.
For the most of the video I was beyond confused because I suck at math for many reasons but seeing this was amazing
:0
= Finn
I want my math teacher to play this video at school
9 volt will like it Bcs he is like math ➗➖➕
bluds a genius
WHY ARE THER LETTERS IN MATH
:OOOOO Nuevo Video de Animation? WOW ya los extrañaba :')
I think its illegal to be this good, i feels amazed and confused at the same time
Bro didn't even learn math and used those things as a weapon better than Albert Einstein
Beautiful... next animation vs physics
my mans just made math cinamatic
I love your animations
Never in my life watching someone doing math is entertaining
HOW DID ORANGE GET THEIR!? HE JUST WOKE UP IN A DARK VOID WITH NO REASON EXPLAINED FOR BEING THERE!!!
Super Video
We breakin out of the calculator with this one 🥶🔥
Everyone knows  10+9=21.
the amount of lore in this video is crazy 🤯🤯🤯
A good visualisation of somme math princibles.
Animator vs Animation part 2 wanting
1 + 1 is 3
I'm speechless, it's genius
666k views 💀
i need more of this!!!!❤❤❤❤
Mr Robot version of the math is here, folks
Math lore
Alan, let's continue the animation against mathematics, you can also call colorful stickman friends
I hate that I understand some of the things he’s doing
I am now into math again.😂❤
Do people really hate pi = e = 3 this much?
Aw, the chosen one is helping us with math, 6 by the multiple of 2 equals 36, therefore 6 x 6, pi equals 3.14.
SO EPIC！
Yo que soy malo para las matemáticas me gusto la animación apesar de que no entendí las formulas 😅
I like this alan, this can be learning and knowledge for mathematics in each class. Like grade 12 math, you must have gotten a lesson like this
My teacher is going to love this
1+1 2
1=1=2
imagine after watching this video, all the math teachers started teaching like this, Math would be my most favorite subject than XD
where is this dudes oscar, this is pure beauty
Just listen to sound effects.
wow
2두개로 활만드는거 그림그리는 사람들 중에 한번쯤 생각해볼만하다 진짜ㅋㅋ 진짜 참신하네
I’m not that good at math myself but this… puts a smile on my face
Make this into a vr game, MAKE THIS INTO A VR GAME. Whoever does will single handedly be responsible for an entire generation of people saying "math is finally FUUUNNN".
Super 🙀🙀
Bro , u give me so much motivation, after this vid i got a different point of view about math
School taught us math so that  we can understand this video when it comes out.
It sure must’ve taken a lot of math to animate this
Woooooooo 😮
I never thought I'd enjoy math this much ♥, you did absolutely amazing work!
As a highschooler, I can confirm that this is what I think when looking at the formula sheet
This is the only time I actually love math
That why i hate math
My least favorite subject is math but this is sick
My last brain cell trying to solve the math exam be like💀
666k view☠☠
Epic
Amazing
The math checks out.
Math is the hell...
this shit went hard
1 + 1= 2
As a math nerd, this is like my new favorite thing. I love how you started out with the fundamentals of math, the 1=1 to 1+1=2, and then steadily progressed through different areas until you're dealing with complex functions. There's so much I can say about this, it's so creative. Good job, Alan and the team.
This vídeo is only possible because alan becker is asian
my freaking brain hurt so damn much lmao
1+1 is 58 bruh
as much as i found this entertaining and cool, i got absolutely none of the math
AMAZING!!!
The + End......wow
Who says math is useless? This is EPIC! All the different constructs were cool. I wouldn't be surprised if math classes started using this in their lessons? You have to wonder how SC ended up in that math void though? I half expected it to all be a dream.
1+1 to overcomplicated math. Am impressed.
Yo Explains better than my math teacher! But I'm in eighth grade and I think I got it? If they were explaining math teachers like this they wouldn't understand it easily
Is this formula used to be build teleportation/time travel?
que buen video lptm
As animações do alan becker sempre me surpreendem.
Teacher:this is your math homework,is easy and i wish you done the homework tommorow. The math homework:
I learned math like this I would istantly be the best in my class
Man wheres the diameter
too much math
1+1=3
Veri good
9+10?
AWESOME
I don't know what to say, this is very pretty and precious. It has the potential to change things you know, really. Only people like this can beat the "mathophobia", so to speak. As we all know, it's big problem of ours that prevent us from making more and more progress.  I hope this series gets bigger and bigger, as the Animation vs. Minecraft did.
Already in the middle of the video, I no longer understood anything in the equations or what was there at all, but I understood one thing. This is the best math video I have ever seen! Just respect! Wow!
this is too complicated for my brain
9+10=21
This video made me love math
The character in this video (⚠️Beware of spoilers)        the orenge stickman, e^iπ, -cos(π)+isin(π), Σ(((iπ)^2)/n!), The e^iπ boss, ζ, φ, δ, א.
2+2 is fish
i hope this is how math will be taught in the future
leasson from this video: the ''e'' is evil
Good
Me explaining the teacher how i did my homework
Math teachers dreams
Bro turned it from just math to a entire war
Esto es Maravilloso! Hicieron un excelente trabajo Alan y su equipo ❤️✨
yes this is spectacular a new video by alan becker after so long, what a good saturday
Tôi là người việt nam😅😂

As a creator of "Numbers 0 to Absolute Infinity", I'm very impressed by your mathematical animation ! It's very successful !
This was out of this world
I think I learned something 🤔
holy crap i really enjoy math i really enjoy animations i super enjoy this
Is a good
So, when the second coming needs help fighting with those elite mercenaries, we know where he'll find one.
I can't imagine how long it took you to make this IT WAS AMAZING
это точно математика?
I did not expect this, but it is pretty 🅒🅞🅞🅛. And pretty creative too
この動画楽しめるってだけで理系に行って良かったと思った
The sound design in this video was absolutely STELLAR! Loved every second of it.
AIN'T NO WAY WE GOT TO SEE A STICKMAN FIGHTING EULER'S IDENTITY AND ITS MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS.
me in math exam
This is so damn creative,if math teach like this in school ,who will sleep?This is a master piece and a fun way to learn math xd
Noice
1+1 is very easy is 2 right. 😎
Deathstar
The detail and accuracy of most of the math in this is insane! Some of it was obviously not accurate like the mech boss but it was so fun!
I learned more in this video than in school
13:46 ℵ
Egg                                                                                                         Pls like
1 + 1 is not 11 it's ofc a key
Математический анализ - страшная штука
i think i like math now lol
ok wtf
Now if THIS was how I learned all this garbage, I would’ve been SO much more invested.
Where is Animator vs animation????!!!!
I learned more about math in this video alone than all of school.
WHAT THE MATH did I just watch!!?
Even with the action parts aside, this video is exactly why I love math.
This is so awesome. I understood a decent chunk of it until stopped trying and just enjoyed the fights, but just using numbers and math to make a sick animation like this is so cool.
77+33=100 ☝️🤓
Gente ameiiiii❤❤❤❤
I wish that’s how I learned math
Wow
Math in school no😢 Math in Alan animation 👏👏👍👍👍👌
I love Math, after watch this video I adore Math
I'm curious: What was that giant entity in the background?
Anyone else get that at 12:28, the SC spells “exit” by adding a multiplication sign and covering half of pi?
Alan Becker got exposed! He is a Mathematics Expert!!!!
representing math in a way that looks awesome and is still clearly math? holly Sh*t man. Also does anyone have any idea what that final equasion was before stickman vanished?
Omg 😮
Im confused but also excited at the same time after watching this video
this is math the right way
I am left both thoroughly confused and entertained at the same time! Amazing work as ever!
Rush "e"
This hurts my brain in both ways.
Aprender matemáticas de forma normal: ❌ Aprender matemáticas con esta obra de arte: ✅
Love the vid good job
I love how TSC uses a visual approach to his maths, after all he does draw so well that his art comes to life
This is the only time where algebra is useful
that good
Woah that is a LOT of math that I don't even know yet! Another indescribable mini movie!
OMG FINALLY A NEW
Want this so cool the animation
1+1 is 11 as a joke but it’s actually two
Who know math wasn’t boring when you’re using it in battle?!
When you are a fan of maths you couldn't dislike this
There should be world record or A National Best Educational video award for this video.
when the bad guy is literally just e also I love how he keeps finding new ways of deriving Euler's identity so he can beat up e
only alan could make badass fight scenes out of fucking calculus
You have to be really smart and really fast to understand what is happening. I cannot figure it out in an instant
okay math can be cool
Can't wait to see a mathemetician reaxt to this.
Bro said : 🧠big brain time
4 WEEKS
Wow so cool
e is the best character pun intended
Does clicking off a video before it ends affect how much money is made out of it? Because I think the team deserves to be credited in the video, not just in the description that rarely anyone reads.
This could help me with my math tests😎
My math teacher could never
Why is there a א
How does Alan even come up with this stuff?! It's UNREAL!!!  Incredible as always. Keep it up.
When my teacher told me "mathematics is your best weapon for life", I don't think that's what he meant 😅.
i feel like orange is just tripping while in the jail cell
This guy can literally makes everything even *MATH* into a fun journey that makes us more curious and want to explore, Alan and second coming, you need to be a teacher, seriously
Jadi itulah rumus untuk membuat mesin waktu 😂
wow
This video is AWESOME
1+1is 2
HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO TAKE THE MOST RANCID INGREDIENTS AND FUCKING **COOK** WITH IT-
My calculator during my calc 2 exam
Infinite function gun was amazing. Cudos
Best animation ever❤
😮
Teachers teaching us math in a nutshell:
POV:The primary😧
Definitivamente es de las mejores animaciones sibre todo por sj banda sonora alan sos goooood ❤
This legitimately would have helped me and so many of my peers visualize concepts in more advanced mathematics and calculus…
Such a sick video, loved every second of it
This is an amazing replica of how math should be
Математика убивает
I love how Euler's Identity is antagonized in this video.
The teaser for this was 2 days from my birthday!
14:02
I don't know if it was intentional, but this video is also a metaphor for how math can be applied to both harm people and to help them.
1+1=?
I don’t like math
This should be the most loved featured project on YouTube just because of how amazing it is
Animation vs Duolingo
это уже клише что со стикменами дружатся после драки
extraordinary😲
Ho my good
=f(•)
AMAZING.
I Love how even the letters don't want to be in math.
Sha, la mea volaa
You are sooo genius
Running out of ideas much? 😂
That’s how I feel in maths lessons😂
This comes to show that even animations can teach math if you do it correctly enough  Edit: Fighting math is a gamers nightmare, change my mind
bro orange is the smartest person in the whole world
Respect to the people who had to pay attention in school in order to make this video
Okay, ngl I got lost after 3:20 like my mind got imploded multiple times over and just overwhelmed of how Alan Becker made math into art or animation
imagine needing to know some extreme maths to make a stick figure animation
How...how did you just made Math fun ?!
All this math is making my head hurt 😭
Omg thiiiis is sooooo coooool omg👍👍👍
The world's most lethal weapon the integral with functions
this is the reason they teach us math to fight  e with the power of coordinates
aleph 0
my brain during the math exam:
May be that's how maths was made🕳️
Now we just wait for Animation Vs. The Alphabet
After the integration, I do know nothing.
Wow 😍
where is his friend
AMAZING!!!
10:00 waaaaaaah!!!
Wow... My brain is dead.
Alive null
Animation: in the Multiverse of Madness
This honestly makes me want to learn more math so I can understand what’s happening in this better.
the amount of work that went into this is insane. also,  he makes it easy to know how he is going to make new symbols next!
Too much math to handle
Time to study maths after this
Bro i have a question where is orange come from why is he there? In math universe
As a calculas student i have 0 clue as to what i just saw
This is an absolute masterpiece. Those are the only few words that are flowing through my brain right now.
Brilliant!
on 0:07 there's number1
😮best YouTube video
Man. A mathematical genius and a bunch of VR game developers need to get together and make this a reality.
When this Math Animation is more fun than any math videos or lessons.
Bro made a Death Star
I don't understand half of the material, but it sure does look cool!
alan is a god y just i say this
Я гуманитарий
A masterpiece
Why is this actually so cool? I really love this!  Tysm for another video Alan!😊
Pov: The Exam
I hate math but this is fascinating
Math is beautiful ❤
Now imagine if yellow was in here..
Con este video aprendo mejor en la clase de matematicas
Even if the laser circle is going up forever, it's still destroying things
I hope a math teacher would actually show this to their class just for education reasons or for fun
I like simple math. Advanced math with letters? I despise that.
Lyrics:  WEEEEEHHHHH
Mathematicians and school nerds love this. So do I XD
This video is both amazing and very trippy. Great job!
Has orange found X yet.
Imagine if you were in math class and your teacher was Alan Becker and he showed you this
1+1=? ,not 1+1=2
math fighting game would be dope
i know only 1 + 1 - 1 x 5
Never let yellow into this place or else he will never want to leave
Bro taught all the school lesson😂
Purely amazing. A very good video on combining multiple mathematical fields terkoiz pls explain the whole video past halfway I already cannot understand much of the things...
i swear to god if alan becker drops out Animation VS English next
This is by far one of the most intriguing and special videos I've ever watched on YouTube... Immediately sub'ed to Alan's channel here and will watch all of his other works!!
HOLY COW I did not expect this at ALL Amazing!
So what happened to orange?
I've never been so entertained when it comes to math
2
Wow 😯😯😯
Omg not even sky is the limit of alan becker's creative :D 1:6 ppl liked this video XD
Me when math added letters 4:10
MATH!
Alan Becker and the art of battle with mathematics
Oh my gad! It's perfect!1000000000000000/10
Thank you, Alan.
No way bro made math cool goddam
holy god this is amazing
Bro you're amazing🤯🤯
Dude math is really my favourite subject and animation is too . Dude u combined both i really like the animation vs math:)
If you love Math then what is  1+1=   It's not 2 at all  So 1 is have invisible ¹ in there so  1 (invisible One) + 1 (invisible One)  Let make them Short  1¹+1¹=   Remember there are invisible One in the top  Let's Answer it  1¹+1¹= 2² (the answer is 2-Square) but it not done yet   2 Square or 2²  2²= 2×2= 4  There is it you have the answer is Four (4)   The answer in ______________ 1+1=4
The cooking math
So The Second Coming can talk in Math language and green also can talk in noteblock language
This was actually better than my math lessons at school 😂
I feel in a math classroom
I'll say it, this is THE COOLEST AvA spinoff
Headcannon that this is what happens in your head when glasses man pauses you in Animator v Animation
Teacher : alright class today we have a math test The math test:
Wait, so cos and sin is really that powerful?! Then how about the others like tan, csc, sec etc.??
Mathematicians were right all along, MATH CAN BE FUN
(i + have + no + words) [this+is= (amazing x fabulous x insane x ♾️)]😘
I'm happy I subscribed this channel.
you are seriously artist brother🙂👍 your follower from iraq😎👍
Alan Becker: i have IQ 9999🧠
Well... It's math:)
All match in 14 minutes
Você não vai entender o que eu falei mas se ele conseguiu lutar e ganhar contra a própria matemática ele já tem poder suficiente para ganhar da maior parte da ficção, pois ele literalmente lutou contra uma coisa com poder praticamente infinito
Me la estoy pasando bien raro...
Hi Alan Becker my name is Cameron Scott and I just what to say I like your videos and you have epic talent, keep up the good work. My favourite characters on your channel are green, orange, and purple.
Words cannot describe the oringality of this idea
This guys is making matrix movies ngl
I'm to stupid to know most of these 😵🙃
8:25  This is Narito's Clone attack
This explains the whole lore of the math in a pretty short video MUCH MORE than you could study in school or in online lessons, even in an epic way that is not boring at all, it's like a movie but at a whole another level. Great one!!!
this is crazy
animation vs python
ep 2 😢
ALEPH NOT ALEPH NULL
Glad we've reached the day where stick fight animations have nearly become too complex for a layperson to understand
Mathematicians were right all along, MATH CAN BE FUN
We for sure need a part 2 of this
Alan literally explained my 16 years of learning math in 14 minutes
Welcome to Math Zone:  Why Orange Pivot will ever join the fight?
The reason why i love math. It's fun !
It's amazing how a stick figure with an empty head managed to learn all the math in just 14 minutps, and I'm in the 7th grade at school and I haven't learned even half of it (sorry for bad english, google)
Never knew math was this fun to watch😊
bro took those math games to a whole another level
11:00 dude litterally made death star from scratch
Alan is studying math for a hard time well done!! For making a video about math!!!
Basically Math
Its a cannon event
HOW DID MATH MAKE ME CRY WTF
this is just math but wepaons
you know when math is hard when you need to calculate letters 😔
yo orage is mart
Alan mind's : Stickman x imagination = success
Sumpah keren banget cok oiya  iform indonesia
XD
Se eu fosse professor de matemática iria rodar isso pros alunos.
THIS WAS ONE OF, IF NOT THE MOST CREATIVE ANIMATION IVE SEEN
Man now i wish i had friends that really loved algebraics and math to show this to.
IQ2000WOW
Hard math
dude is literally learning math faster than the entire human population 🎉
dayum
Is this what I have to face in my studies?
My teacher: Maths are cool.  Me: Really? How cool?  My teacher: *shows this video to the class*
Eres un genio
lol star of death from star wars
Alan made studying math the coolest it’s even been with this banger
BUT MATH IS 🅱AD... VERY VERY 🅱AD!         Mokey.
This is how nerds have their fun
This is the coolest and smoothest animation in the world! Keep up the good work!
This is why I've trekked through high school calculus. I only wish to understand this masterpiece of an animation
Artık matematiği çok seviyorum
Am so smart now
Solo Alan Becker You can make math God
Was up👋👋👋
e vs 🟠
teaches us better than school
every video you drop make me realise how you're more creative that i thought
wow love it
This NEEDS to be a series!
The cracks forming with negative square roots was brilliant
1×1=2
Recently learning of these equations, this is an amazing way to visualize it.
My math was not enough after 1 😢
I don't understand
Who else thought this was a joke
As much as I hate math this made me smile XD
Dude, I simply have no words, incredible 👏👏
I like math
*IMPORTANT*                      THE + END = THE END 🔚 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this.
How to burn your brain:
Uhmmmmmmm..... My head hurts💀🥲
Animation vs Math →Orange Animation vs Biology → Red Animation vs Chemistry → Blue Animation vs Physics →Yellow Animation vs Philosophy → Green
Ahga buga!
이거지
Khi m giỏi toán mà mẹ bắt làm phim😂
The way that the math was visually represented, paired with the music and sound effects, made this so fun to watch. Thanks, Alan and team!
Daily dose of math
The second coming knows more math than  me
If math was a game where it need strategies to complete the whole thing:
I finally understand math
i understood like the first half but i kept watching because of the flipping amazing action i only understood up til about 3:49
DUDE THIS WAS SICK!!
how did you make math into an action film?
Ngl this be boring asf
You guys! New math gameplay just dropped.
That 2x2 bow was legendary and thar sin cos wave blast. Everything become complex when you add imaginary
OK then what is 3x+1 answer
Hello alan
thats why math is important XD       also "infinite" was epic ngl
When you are creative with numbers
my brian could not comprehend this much math
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro I kinda learned a lot from this.. mainly how majority of equations lead back to the same equation and how Cosine and (the other “sine”) are op as hell…
i s next animations vs coding?
Stick figure can do anything!
this is amazing, but alan missed an opportunity when he didn’t mention the guy from the math problems and his infinite supply of anything
This is beautiful
See, math is that easy.
Who let him use the calculator
Plot twist: Alan’s kid had to do math homework and originally wanted orange to help
I like math now :)
So, what were Yellow, Blue, Red and Green doing while Orange was in the Math Dimension?
POV: Your math teacher shows this video after final test
I'm convinced this man has 300IQ
Masterpiece.
I hate math even more
this is amazing
I can guarantee some math teacher is gonna show this to their students
... Qué genio este tipo. Muchas gracias por tus videos!
This is without q doubt the coolest video i have ever seen.
Waw that so cool. I love that ♥♥
Of course the animation is immaculate, but I’d like to draw attention to the incredible sound design used in this video which might be the best on this channel, apart from in Animator vs Animation V.
wooooooow somesing realy cool!!!
My Brain Exploded... 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
So creative dude ! 👍👍👍
I think the teachers are gonna put this on school
A cada animação, as produções do Alan estão cada vez melhores
TSC is about to become MASSIVE BRAIN
나보다 너무 똑똑한 주황이   하긴 ㄹㅇ 재미있어보이긴 하네
나보다 너무 똑똑한 주황이   하긴 ㄹㅇ 재미있어보이긴 하네
великолепно
Beautiful video. It' s awesome
Archimedes would be proud
The fact that you realize that Matt is actually entertaining here makes it clear that Alan should definitely deserve an Emmy.
The "this is the best video ever" count is off the charts!
Somehow you made a very boring subject into a very interesting concept for procrastinating in class. Just what I need
Bro needs to make a game
Well Alan becker would definily make fun math games
I gotta send this to my math teacher ASAP
Masterpiece
I had no idea math could be so epic I'm also surprised at just how much of that I understood, considering math was the subject I was worst at
Wait at the end was the letter A in Hebrew????
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
bro iam watching your videos on 2017 to you video is good
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
legendary
please make animation vs physics next
I fucking love channel
i hate this damn video
Obviously is made about greek characters for anyone don't know
Video Is Very Good! 👍👍👍👍
If The Second Chosen was a teacher then I would choose him😂
alan becker sou um inscrito seu brasileiro e vou te falar bela representação. Mas so um problema n entendi nada dali mas n vou esquentar com isso pq soou da quinta serie então a muito ainda pra eu aprender.
НЕЕЕТ ПОЧЕМУ КОНЕЦ НЕЕЕТ НЕТ НЕТ НЕТ!!! Не конец а продолжение следует. Alan продолжение ну или похожий ролик очень круто🤩
Escalated from swordfighting to orbital laser cannon
Only a villain deals in trigonometry.
I got headache when watching this
1+1=window
😱😱😱😅😎😱
U KNOW WHAT THEY SAY "KNOWLEDGE IS POWER😂😂
how does this connect to purple guy
That’s kinda sweet tbh-
I can't tell if he really loves math, or absolutely hates it... 😂 Very impressive in any case. I'm a bit confused about the ending though. Did the e kill the stick figure?
Math is my favorite
confusing but cool. pretty much alan becker lol
IN the picture TSC be like : how can we do this 😐😑🤔
This is my favorite Animation vs video of all time. Outstanding work, Alan
I am in 8th grade and i had a totally different experience from my brother in college 2nd year
e is the final boss of math
Как думаете долго он это рисовал?
could someone help me idk if am just an idiot but in 3:29 doesent  4 to the power of zero equal 0? why 1?
I dont understand why people dont like math. It is easy as heck
wow very cool animated I'm shocked 😮
Me when I meet my Thailand girlfriend: 2:04
This was duper epic ❤❤❤
As someone who f’ing loves math. This video is the most satisfying thing to watch. Especially with the score and great sound design.
bruh this video came out right when i had forgotten math but now circumstances have made me go back to math, and I'm completely lost
i am learning maths now and its not boring
What happens in a regular baldis basics fans brain
2
WELP... i guess a STICKFIGURE is smarter than us now ; - ;
Finally, a worthy opponent
Sc: WHAT IS THIS SORCERY!?!?!
I liked this video, looking forward to more videos like this
Wow i wish that my teacher use this vidio to teach me math
he sure knows advanced math
Guys, whats The + End?
You know is a good day when alan upload
HI
Orange becoming Albert Einstein caught in 4k
The music really fits with the absence of nothing and figuring out the mysteries of math, and SC (including me) is learning new things of math
This was STUNNING!  I mean I saw "Animation vs. Math" and kept my expectations low, but you knocked it out of the park!  I mean everything about this was so incredibly inventive, from the scenes of Orange learning how the parts and pieces of this new world work, to the INSANE combat visuals, where it all makes sense!  I don't think you could've nailed this any more perfectly, well done!
W Alan as usual
9:30 DOOMSTICK The Second Coming.
WOW
It was very epic, you could even say that Alan Becker outdid himself, but...I did not get anything :P
Video like 👍
Really encapsulates how math is all fun and games till letters show up.
damn that new cum beam is powerful
This video showed me more maths than my school ever has. Sure, I didn't understand most of it, but...
Yo cuando estoy aburrido 🤣 jugando con la calculadora
Math
I notoriously hated math cuz I was never good at it. But the way Alan makes this stuff look like fun is forever baffling to me. I’m so floored by this, this just further solidifies Alan as my favorite animator ever. Dude just can do anything with his team, props to everyone that helps him and all of that because you guys are always unmatched. I love this channel, still is one of my greatest inspirations to get into animation. And always will be 🙏🏽💖
Hey Alan, I need help understanding my Chemistry homework  Mind making a Animation vs. Chemistry real quick?
How do you come up with this?
Это афигено!!
Problem solved
math can be interesting
e
I love how Aleph is the biggest at the end.
wouldnt it be funny where "animator vs math" would just be alan taking a math exam?
Math was somehow….. entertaining because of this video. Wow. Props to you Alan! Yeah I only understood like a fourth of this video cause I’m dumb but this was still super amazing! Using so many symbols as weapons was so incredible!
That’s what I call the Epic Mathematician Showdown!
Mathe war und ist in meinem Kopf schon immer ein kriegs Zustand...mein problem Fach ganz klar...aber nice...so hätte es vielleicht funktioniert 😊
Who knew math can be so dangerous?
Alan probably had a mathematical cursus and thought he could make something with it (bro is animation Robin Gan)
3:15 fucking hell, this is the most interesting math video I've seen in years... If I had THAT visualization for all the crap back in school, I'd actually had understood it.
Quiero que se saque una serie televisión por favor lo pido
Just Shapes And Beats?
this guy makes math into a cool animation
8 0:04
Bro mastered math in 14 minutes 💀
Esta animación me a cambiando mi forma de ver las matemáticas xd
im stuck this level math
🤯
No entendí, pero me gustó 😂❤
Bro explained to be the new albert einstein
Oonoo
Therapist: you cant do anything divided by 0 the second coming at timestamp 2:48 : yes you can
I AM SO CONFUSE AND SO FACINATED
7:31 the radius is 1, and e fights with 1 as a sword, they are the same, but as soon as e changes to 2 he is stronger than Orange's 1.
Most of these comments are npc like just say good job bro. You don't need to make a whole speech but anyways I stopped understanding at the powers.
Next video animation vs SCIENCE
its crazy that Alan actually made math interesting.🤯I swear your animations are getting better and better. 6/24/2023
Only alan becker can find a way to add combat to math.
This is the only video about math I will ever like. School would be so much fun if classes were like this.
i love how the f(infinity) beams have the tengent graph lines
my brain hurts lol but no that was great (understatement)
Мама: хватит youtube смотреть, иди математикой зоймись  Я: я уже
If only math was taught at school like this
Math but explained by a stickman
Idk why I underste all lol
4:16 waht was thaat? *mindblown*
OK Alan, this is strange, but...nice
Did not expect to see the death star in animations vs math 10:37
I never knew Math would be this fun than my current physic class fr
Good Animator + Stickman = BEST ANIMATION VIDEO!
I don't like math
pov = pasulangan  cari jawaban
How the heck is this guy capable of making interesting video about math?!!!!!
So thats how math work in reality
何だこれ？，
I finally found the reason why we’ve been wasting our time learning math
I'm dying for this to go viral and the math nerds on Youtube dissect this enough for me to really get it. The best I can grip now is that SC defeats "e" with bigger and bigger calculations, but I know there's more to it. And why did Alan pick "e" to be sentient? Who were the others at the end? If I knew a math genius I'd show this to them and beg them to explain.
im a fith/about tobe sixth graider so the only thing i recodnized is 4=1/4 btw can soemone explain the math for me 🧐
🤯🤯🤯 As someone who studied Mathematics before Differential Functions, I will say that this is the MOST AWESOME FEELINGS! To understand what happens to the prolongation of all this MASTERPIECE (At least 30%), this is an Unusual and Incomparable EXPERIENCE! I just realized that I did not study mathematics in vain, it was all for the sake of understanding many Math functions in this Epic Battle! 😂😁😎
GooD
I enjoy learning math Because you did this Video 🫵
Hi
just beatiful 🥲
Ето нужно показать учителю математики:₽
なんだこの凄まじい式変形と発想は…
คณิตศาสตร์โครตตึง😂😂😂😂
Alan, you know you're an amazing content creator when within 2 hours of one of your videos being out, it has OVER 9,000!!!! comments on it.
I never thought I would ever watch a math video or a video like this, but this was an amazing video! I hate math and it’s hard to learn for me, but if all educational math videos or like this, I would love math!
Он победил математику..
I like this
Animation vs physics, chemistry please ❤❤❤😊
imagine an asian or a math genius was teleported to this dimension, oh boy they are gonna die 💀
Wtf.....
That was a beautiful mathimatical miss of awesomeness
今はまだ分からない(15歳)けど、将来わかるようになった時が楽しみ
Dang to do math this level, you would need  years to practice. If it was like this, minutes. Multidimensional polar graphs, complex numbers, trigonometry, geometry, functions and  complex subeects like infinity and more.
The second coming is literally rushing E
Pea brain
waiting for the math teacher reacts videos so i can understand 80% of this video great work
I live that orange won by essentially making the death star 😂, the creativity in this mans creations is amazing
Did I just witness orange doing the beam attack of king orange because I feel like he learned that from him
this is too fast, how am I gonna learn anything WAIT!
Man people are about to instantly make edits of this 😂😂😂😂 TSC Full Potential vs TSC Math capability 😂😂😂
Finally, after all these years  MATH ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE
Gosh the sound effects sounds so cool
i think i few grades too low to understand _most_ of this
I wish you were my math teacher
now i know math
Here's how to make Fortnite out of math
Incredible, like the music ❤❤❤
I LOVE YOU ALAN!!!
This is a masterpiece
As someone who was born with ADHD, this is what math class felt like in my head. Paying attention at first, and then losing focus towards the end while going on a wild adventure inside my head
This is absolutely ✨MATH-STERPIECE✨
I hate math😠🤨
Calculator world😂
The animation is sooooo cool I like it fr
So is second coming just gone now
I love math
What students see:  (1>2)+⁴(2×÷□)=~\23%  What teachers see:
pov my brain during math class
Dude just created professorpeice ❤❤❤
This is Math. But in a real fun way.
MAKE SCIENCE NEXT
Hey did Orange make that thing from people playground
smart stick
that was soooo good and soooo funny
My understanding is of that of a freshman in highschool, so i have no idea how most of this works, but holy shit this is so damn good.
👍👍
Fantastic but what does this have to do with the lore?
This video made my head explode from thinking so much 🧠🧠🤯🤯
Things went from the most basic numbers to the most incomprehensible fractions and yet still gave too damn clear visualiser that I could keep track of everything while understand nothing. MASTERPIECE!!!!
Next do animation vs. bad animation
Basically Fighting math games
I love math so it gonna be legit 😎
*e^iπ shows up*  Okay, you sorta lost me. What does e stand for again? I know i=√-1 and pi, but I can't remember e
How is orange consistently the coolest dude ever?
Alternate Title: Animation vs Dollar Store version of the matrix
beautyfull
What if math is like this?
Very amazing to see, but it doesn't change how I feel about math.
Ok now this is the math subject that we are looking for
Alans Math Class Be like
About time he posted
1:38 explain this 😮
Coooooooooooooooool
I love the team that showed up in the end, especially ℵ, which is used to express the levels of infinites there are.  Also love phi being there, the famous golden ratio.
i learn something from  this video
I hate math😢😢😢😢😢 love you ❤️❤️❤️
Just by looking at the title and thumbnail, you can get an idea of how crazy and epic this episode's gonna be.
Hình ảnh của tôi khi mất gốc toán be like:
Não của tôi 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
Alan, you just give it 1 + 1 + you = friendship together. Your video is great! Keep up the good work.  You might already know how to solve math problems.
That was awesome!!!
Hello creator of the animations, I have a question. Have you tried to make a 3D animation of those stickman because it would give a lot of encouragement to your videos and so you would gain many likes and all your fans would be crazy to see one of your 3D stickman animations, thanks to the creator. from the animations alan becker
🤯
ESSE FOI UM DOS VIDEOS MAIS LEGAIS Q EU JA ASSISTI
I can confirm that dealing with imaginary numbers is pain.
why is nobody talking about the fact that orange drew a perfect circle first try
i like the ending just cuz of the alaph noil part and i dont even think i typed that right
i just got a book i was dreaming about and THIS VIDEO IS HERE! IM HAPPY 100X MORE THAN YESTERDAY!
This is the best math topic I've ever seen
Amazing
HOLYYYY COW!!! The Best Animation that I've ever Seen
DANG I LOVE IT U TURN NERD I MEAN MATH TO FUN
if math was like me fighting -1 by using eqquations that have powers wow man i would learn fast like orange
10×10=100
i thought the title said meth im dying send help
Woah
Gila keren alan 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Wow😮😮
Now this is my crap, this is the content I crave
++-=
WE NEED A PART 2
This shows that math is much more than we know as us dumb kids (jk) the music tells me that there is still so much more that I don't know and that orange here is going beyond his limits
This is great but I also have no idea what just happened
I wish my every lesson would be like this
Math is soo big...
Something that will inspire people to like math
Bro explained whole math in 14 min
Wheres the part where he does 1 ÷ 0 and creates infinity
I only had lessons which went to minute 3.40 rest is idk
TSC would be the best math teacher
Sir how the fuck did you make math satisfying and fun and enjoyable and cool as all hell??
лор математики за 14 минут
This is my favorite animation on youtube
incredible ! i did math for Eight years and i know evreything on the animation, now i know why it's useful. Keep Up The animation, THEY ARE CRAZY ! YOU ARE CRAZY !
Another masterpiece how original. How someone has such creativity is just ridiculous. Never thought I'd see math be used as a fight scene. You are truly inspiring.
Alan can you make ep 2 of wanted
woooooow but every day this man gets smarter xDDDDDD
bro surpassed 3blue1brown's animations in just one video
Nice
as someone who sucks in math themselves, i have no idea what the fuck is going on on my screen. it looks very cool tho,
1+1 is not 11 it is 2
wow nice, cool and educational video for kids!  oh.
I thought when i saw the title is that orange would invade a digital math textbook but this was wayy better.
Just thinking about it hurt my brain just how not only they have to animate but also do math homework too
one of these in combination with a game engine would be cool some day
Nice here we go
smart stickman
This has to be the most nerd one video can get 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
FINALLY
cool is very cool and the animation is cool and the sound is super.
how about animation vs programming?
I love this
I bet kids wish for teachers to explain like that its a masterpiece
Hooooollllly Shiiiiittttt!!!!!!
Tsc should have added +1 to e^iπ smh bad at math
My math teacher would absolutely love this! Such a cool video
Bruh I had to keep pausing and playing because I couldn’t read it properly 😢 💀   Edit: this was so confusing
This is the most intense way of khan academy.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ "perfect" ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
i dont know what to say
I came for the Beautiful Animations, but I stayed for the insane sound design and music. Truly an work of art on all fronts.
tbh i dont understand everything in this video
This will be good to learn at school teacher can just put this instead of those forever learning
Thankyou alan my math exam is comung 😂😂 . Btw love your classes ❤❤
Dark soul boss fights be like
very very good
If only teachers could teach us maths in this way :(
I loved seeing the Second Coming figure the math out and learning from it as he went, he's a smart lil cookie
I never thought I’d see the day for where we’d make anime-like fight scenes out of MATH, but Alan Becker managed to nail it once more!
THE POWER OF MATH!
Eventhough I understand most of the things in this video, no I still don’t like math lol
For some reason I feel like I've just watched a sci-fi Christopher Nolan Movie😅
And the fact that it all started with just 1
Holy moly fuckin shit.   I seriously got ~3.14- words for this.
First we had stick figures ruining the internet Now they're ruining math What's next? They're gonna ruin all of Asia?
Ещо не когда математика была на столько интересной
This has to be the coolest thing I’ve seen in a long while
epic
That. Was. Amazing.
10:00  WAAAAAAAAH
bro found the duplication glitch💀💀
This is where TSC goes when he sleeps
Talk about 10000IQ
I swear god, I watched this animation... I still don't like math:(
Respect
we are def getting part 2 to this, with aleph and the others coming
So good
Of all the things to make animation about. I didn't think math would be one of them, and somehow you make it work. Having hard time keeping up what equations or symbols you are using in the animation.
I think we need a part -2 Like if you do!
Matherpiece
It would be interesting if there was context on how he ended up in that math world like messing with a calculator app
Alan made math interesting (something that my teacher wasn't able to)
You had to fight math equation in at the end of school?!
Pov : Me math test in school
I like the part where Euler's constant just used 'i' to disappear from the real to the imaginary dimension of the numbers and the 3rd and 4th dimension representation.
This is one of your best videos EVER. Like if this was on cinemas it would get googol earnings. Great job!
13:47 wow aleph is really suspicious :0
i'll come back here when I can understand this stuff
11:03 that was just overkill.
It's just incredibly awesome
I can't believe the Orange Stickman would decimate almost a entire population of them with their giant goddamn laser, holy crap
Never actually understood how /0 works until now lol
This, is the real Math lore.
Now maths is more fun to learn and ez
After watching this video figured the different functions and formulas that were being used when both Euclidean and The Chosen Ones Return were just numbers that canceled Each other out and Alan put it in a way that was very creative and entertaining. Is it possible that a formula can destroy another plane of existence IDK but I think it shows symbolizing how powerful these formulas are
Broooo... 4:50 feels just like when in AvA3 clippy fights the chosen one
Math lore
It's was Amazing plz makes part 2 and making off
alan can turn everything into an animation
hi
L
L
Math 😎👍
Nice work alan
Es una locura Alan si haces un juego que tenga enemigos a si una una historia igual te quedaría una locura de juego
Имба
Cute
I want to see a math class with the teacher's reaction to this
The video soinds more cool  when u can understand everything, this is not my case.
I learnt more than my math teacher taught me in the last 2 years
Ω
I was expecting " The + End " to be like " ThE ± 3πd"
i love the animation on this damm soo coool
i understand this math more than my math teacher
This is amazing
This animation is amazing. Thanks for it.
Awesome animation! I do want to note that hitting things with an integral will likely make things bigger
O cara quase destruiu a realidade usando a matemática
알란 베커 영상을 보면서 머리가 아파진 적은 처음이야...
orange is so smart
Increadible
13:46 dude is that aleph 0? The first infinity? Wow you know your math
Alan teach us a math =O
What makes this better is that I understand the references, the math behind it, that makes all the moves and scenes make sense.  Thanks, blackpenredpen.
Very cool.
Don't call math useless!
The most important battle ever conceived, truly a scene to behold.
You know what's cooler than magic? Maths!
I hate math more than anything but this is pretty cool.
This was AMAZING I just loved the battle scene it was so cool
This video just made math fun!
Your literally 100 x, recreating my bored childhood self alone with my calculator
This is something that is still in the roots of Alan's uploads, I loved this video
Bro Alan becker had to do so much math for this animation  Really bro Alan becker is a legend  (I watched it 1.50 speed because it was cool)
와
Number Lore
So these is the power of the math 😮😮
Это ооочень круто, если бы в школах преподавали знания именно в таком формате, было бы куда больше интереса изучать разные образовательные направления. 😁
Bro literally teach us math
symbols
is that the letter א in the end? or am i just so bad at math?
Damm, he integrated it
1+1=2 para sempre ✌️ 🇧🇷
This video is so crazy
symbols
did he just delete tsc-
Good.
4:33 he multiplied himself by zero!
What music is used here?
So all this time this is what we needed mathematics for in life :0
What is happening after baldi catches you in baldis basics:
Dam you are actually that smart in math class
that was the mathest (madest) thing i have ever seen.
Who els thought this needs to be a game lol
I want someone to turn this into a playable game
I think this will be my most favorite episode cuz I like math❤
this is so random
what i only understand about this is orange chasing "e"
this needs to be a whole series frfr
Am confused and I love it
Finally...    Calculator 2!
Did i just re-veiwed everything i learned in math class?  it was awesome keep up man.
انميشن رائع لاكن ايمكن أن تصنع حلقه انميشن ضد انميشن الحلقه الثانيه بليز أنا عربي و احب اعمالك
The most technical video I have ever seen
Let me guess,you're asian.
wooow hhhhh  dude you have a big braine XD
Part 2
Mind blown.
Imagine if math was this fun
Eu jurava que matemática era ruim.😂😂😂
Why numbers
1 braincell added
Was only able to follow for a little while. After a second my brain hurt trying to understand the math behind this 😂
?????????
I wish math class was so fun
Math is the ultimate final boss even for stick figures
역시 수학은 위대해
Alam becker is the best 🤩
Never knew that math could be this interesting, only if my math teacher could use this as a educational video
Only mathematics understand the references
33+77=100
i very quickly realized how complicated this would get
I wonder if the second coming will be able to access these powers in the actual story that’s going on
As an Asian…
Hey can u make ANOTHER season of alen Becker wanted
1+1=2
Teacher: Math is easy  Then my brain
That part where Orange divided 6 by 0 was eerily terrifying... All of this was honestly pretty ominous.
They are friends now it’s almost the end
cool
I HAD BEEN LEARNING IT FOR 10 YEARS! THATS NOT FAIR!!
woah
Dose this video go with the last animation vs. animation episode
The genes Coming
Your videos are fucking crazy, I love it
E
aprende maximo
¡WOW LA ULTIMA ARMA MATEMÁTICA QUE USO GREG FUE COMO UN CAÑON LASER!
With his every video he improve his animation❤❤❤❤❤
The thing is I understood all of this very well 😂😂😂 Never thought I knew math
Alan Becker = genius 😨
What's next, matrix?
MORE MATH
1+1 =3
This is how they should teach math I have no idea about the second half but I definitely be intrigued to learn how those complicated calculations work.
I would love to see a calculator app that works like this.
if there was a game like this when I was in school then I probably would've been more into math not gonna lie :p
Alan Becker’s mind during math class.
the fact that i called the e guy "I e pi" is hilarious
wow💯
This is so cool! I'd totally enjoy math so much more if the Second coming was my math teacher
Math=love ❤
i love math
This would have been a good opportunity to bring baldi’s basics into the ABCU
Alan u are my New favorite math teacher i swear  😂😮
я тут до миллиона просмотров
Apart from how they made lasers and guns from maths. I actually managed to follow this.   Thank you A Level Further Maths.
Who knew a video with math in it could be this wholesome? Keep up the great work Alan!
Bro💀🗿🗿
Can't wait until someone analyze everything in here
who knew maths could be this interesting! amazing animation as always <3
5:35 no one appreciating him drawing a perfect circle, FIRST TRY
Indeed, this is the easiest math class I've ever seen. It is time for me to solve my math homework.
Imagine yellow was the one to be in this situation.  He would have been absolutely giddy
*_Hot damn,_* this video is a love letter to the math community.
I wish my maths teacher is alan becher and he teach me with this animation.
This would make an awesome game to just screw around with, and it would be educational as you try and learn and understand the sums to improve the gear your playing with, and making sure you aren't making mistakes that cause huge enemies to appear.
Holy shit this is awesome!! Especially since I understood all of it.   (I don't intend to brag, it's just fun when you understand references)
Can someone explain to me how much math is in this video?
你把數學變好玩了
its over we don't need maths classes no more
They have a boss fight Who will win let’s find out
This is amazing! Made me like math for a few minutes of my life lol
Epic chose1 y math
Science Equations next!!!!
estos son los problemas matematicos que te pone en la universidad
I loved this more than i can express, only you could give literal math, emotions. Incredible, one of my new fav episodes in this universe
1+1=1+1
I can learn anything from this shit
My math knowledge is over At 7:00
Nah this video is not for me
Fuck Zodiac signs  How far did you get with your math knowledge? (Mine is about 6:40ish)
who's the big symbol at the ending? like an end boss of math?
ALAN!!! why you make such great work but brings me back to math classes and I remembered about 3/4 of this stuff. It's a nightmare and awesome video well done.
Math Belike:
alan sos un crack
Dang so good
After animation vs chatgpt xD it would be legendary if I made them clones xD
This is the very first time and will be the only once that I think Math could be this.. beautiful.. Absolute Well Done, Alan Becker.
Omg got this video after being humbled by IB hl maths and got taught complex numbers recently 😂 Thanks for this high quality video❤ Gives me back lot of motivation (this summer I will be mastering (making friends with) maths🎉
Wait DAMN I THOUGHT THIS WAS FAKE BUT IT WASN’T
Love how the greatest number א just steps in,you can tell they really got deep into this
No.11493
only person to ccome up with this
That's what maths teacher have to show at school!
Stop it, my brain is on fire (metaphorically & literally)
Petition to have Alan Becker do a collab with Mike Salcido 👇
must be way more fun for those who understand everything going on lol
only alan becker can make a math battle
how to learn math in 14 minutes
math has never been so interesting before
Spiderman was right.  Math is cooler than magic.
Very cool
If creativity had a face, it would have looked like alan becker❤
I’m calling this tighten the E titan
The concept is so goofy
I would love school if this was math
My knowledge of Maths is not sufficient to understand this video. 😅
1 = 1
that was awesome  even tho i don't get math
What if you make an animation showing the 4th dimension .......it will be epic
O! M! G! THIS WAS AWESOME IF I HAD TO RATE THIS IT WOULD BE 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10 BEST EVER THE SOUND DESIGN WAS A CHEF'S KISS THIS WAS PERFECT!!
my head hurts🙃
Imagine baldi basics be like:
eu kai na fogueirar levantei sou com a força dar pérna
Iknow how to +,-,÷ BUT WTF =,i,>,<,/
You know, I wouldn’t even be surprised if some teachers legitimately use this to demonstrate certain aspects of math.
1 + 1 = 3
The bright side of math
oh no because of orange now the letters are also in math
i just got out of school and now I want to be in school again. thanks a lot alan.
This is mind blowing
Takes trillions of centuries for just to make this one video...
bro learned math in 14 minutes while I cant even learn it in 9 months
Our history
Finally someone paid attention in math class
*Math teachers be like*: I wonder why my class is so invested today, maybe they think I'm a good teacher! *Class during lunch break*: Guys, Alan Becker released a new video! I think...Math is cool now.
this animation is very perfect. ım from türkiye
what the hell did i just watch
Hey what is the ost for the background music
well this one came out of nowhere didn't it? No one expected this for sure.
*After watching this, I feel myslef much smarter at math* 👀
Alan pls become my math teacher lol
How to make math fun 101
make animation vs sciencie
Top 10 battles more epic than Avengers Endgame:   no seriously this one made me love Complex Analysis (and math in general) even more
That was awesome!!! ❤
Nice. ❤❤❤
thank you alan
Don't know if anyone knows, but the giant figure in the end of the movie is Aleph null, is the first set of countable infinity. ℵ
i want TCO as my math teacher, you cant tell me no
Ive known this channel for atleast 6 years, and im glad i do, never change Alan. You are amazing
MATHMATICAL!
Best math teacher is Alan the king ngl i don't understand any if i study them forever
The only time i’ve ever enjoyed watching math be done
This is how Euler discovered Euler’s identity
Hoping for some more awesome work
1+1=2+4=6+12=18+19=27 K
The big enemy of all THE MATHS
From 1=1 to using a tangent function as a death laser, I can confirm the math checks out
That moment when math is actually interesting
Remember to not only credit alan but also his team (check the description)
WHAT'S 9+10 ?!
Просто бомба ❤❤😃😃😃
i love your animations!
And now you really understand math is power
Best I've seen so far
I learned more math from this than an entire year of algebra
Just Leaving a comment Here
Never thought math can be so epic
That’s it, I’ve decided, maths is my new fav subject
Its... beautiful!
yoooooo......THAT IS AWESOME 😍
Wow good timing for this video I have math exam in couple of days
Poor animators, they had to do alot of calculating:(
this editing is crazy especially to do in 4 weeks. Great job
Ничего не понятно, но очень круто и интересно
This it’s just amazing into my eyes 100/100!
Takes centuries to make this one video...
It was easy and simple at first, but it is complex and hard as it continues, innit m8?
it's the gates between life and death... for the math humans and students 👀    you should not pass
The fact I can look at stuff I learnt before in the video and say "aye I understand that"
Ahora aprendi algo nuevo, literalmente aprendi un problema matematico xd Mi mente: No puede ser ahora soy el cerebro mas inteligente del mundo :v
This video is confusing
WOW that strange but cool and beautiful at the same time.
Matt Damon has been really quiet since this video dropped. Just saying.
Bro went from 1+1 to space time warp
INSANE
How to tell you are an asian animator.
Even tho I'm 14, I don't understand half the sht.
10:00 "wwaaaaah"
This confirms that Alan Becker can make the most boring thing epic.
2
At first i thought this was  fan made then i looked at the channel name
This was the best math class I've ever had since esp.Alan, I just want to say you just drew all the math students who ever take a math class wish their teacher would teach the same way as your animation does.
bro even tho i didnt understand all of it....the parts i understood were so satisfying like when he used limit to counter inifity that was freaking genius....sfx and sound track were sexy af to
When is ep 2of wanted animator vs animation
Everyone knows that 1 + 1 is uuh uuh uhhhhhh hu uhhh u uhhhhhhh hu huu uuhhh uuuuuhhh uhhhh iss uuuuuhhhhhhh is like you have uuuh one pen uh then u get another one uuuuh then u have uuuuh uuuuuuh im bad at math
10:35 I the "hostile orbital laser inbound" moment
we all expeting this video as a short animation for joke  Alan: *yes.*
That was amazing, also how did you get 95k likes in 1h!!!
And they said that math would never help in real life…
🤯
The world will surely be more interested in math after watching this
I don't understand it's already exciting, especially since I understand math.
If only math was this fun back in high school for everyone
my brain be like:
Okay the way he discovered math dang makes me wanna go back to school
о, нормалды под чаек залетает ролик
Слишком много математики😵‍💫 Но было весьма круто👍(БЫЛО ПОТРЯСАЮЩЕ ^^)
Every day Alan Baker surprises me more with what he is capable of doing with such simple things any day he does the most epic battle in history with f&king syntax.
пособие по игре в калькулятор
This stick man learned more than me in 14 minutes
POV your mind during a test
So this is what every 7th grader day dreams about
me be like:  you didnt have to cut me off
This is to funny
Lore: I think the stick figure is stuck inside the canvas of a Khan Academy video.
My maths teacher love this animation
I LOVE'D IT AND I HATE LOVE IT BUT I NEED MORE!!!  This isn't the end, right?
WHAT DOES THE + END EQUAL!?!?
he makes math look fun.
Такая матеша мне нравится 😊
Te amamos Alan
Math is cool! Until you try and understand it
This is very amazing and very well animated, amazing work Becker👍
My math teacher will like this
e
I hope someone explains what's going on because I don't know lol
Orange learned more math than me at school lol
Also xipi meant "exit"
too many references to be made!! brain overloading!!!!!!!!
Hey Alan Can you please make a Animation Vs Backrooms Level 0 to Level 3999 a lot of vids im a MEGA FAN
I'm trying to understand this math but the animation is very good
1+1 is obviously 3
Yo that was epic only if math class were like this ✌️
Free class of maths here
my brain hurts
👍🏼❤
I’m still a kid and i just went to learn imaginary numbers to understand the plot.
I wish my math class was like this.
my math wasn't mathing anymore after the wavy waves and i am somehow glad that i did not understand that because i wasn't subjected to having to go through that.
I learned more in this video than in my classes
Oh my god😅 8:36
I am a math nerd and this entire episode has just made me so god damned happy   *This* is what romanticising math is all about Not the numbers themselves, but how it evolves into utter beauty.
Im so happy 😅😊😂
How did the Second Coming end up in this situation?
Never knew math could be this entertaining
my one word : math
Best 14 minute video ever.
Estaría chido un episodio donde le enseña a los otros
whyle watching this, bro fucked my brain in every angle. Good fcking work, nice Video xD
I still dont know what happened to the second coming
When i check the live chat toi just swearing in animation vs math
Can anyone explain to me everything?
What is the theme song of this video from the beginning.
❤
bro be using Pi for some crazy shit
6:43 Alan that is the funniest just ever. Orange splitting Pi into cos(t) and sin(t) is just amazing.
If only math was this epic
hated math but man i love this
Now This is education
fuck this if it's cinema 🚬
수업 교보재 +1
YouTube + animation = alan becker
Come on man it's Saturday
leave it to Alan to make even math fun!
Alan bro what school did you go to because you made a video that makes 0 sense to us
I've got to say the music is great. I don't even know how much you planned and solved to make this video though 💀
This is the most excited I’ve ever been for math
I thought he was in coma because of math 👀
Alan bro what school did you go to because you made a video that makes 0 sense to us
..........복잡해 그래서 좋아! 재밌어!
stop making me wanna learn math again
What's the name of the song?
How i learn more math:this
Yas! An animated video about math! This was amazing! 2 hours ago
I love the massive ℵ hiding inside the plane at the end, and then the integral symbol being used as a massive polearm earlier on, i love it! it's so cool to see my favorite parts of math in a way I'd never imagined them!
Not 11 2
If we image hard enough this is just a human fighting a machine
Am i the only one who understood that? I mean i'm someone that loves math and does maths literally every single day for fun at 9th grade xD
more please
Only Alan Becker could make mathematics into an intense action movie.
5:38  Oh no the circle
Bored while studying math ?
OK
Absolutely amazing video!!! Great job, man!
Is it me or Am i learning more math from this unlike my teachers
Math has never been so epic
bro went through all x stages of math   find x
omg ❤
If only i put a tenth of this work into school
Wth  Pr
I want to see this video in every school to teach kids about math
2 + 2 = fish
Now I would like to see him make animation vs science,chemistry,biology,coding,physics and more.
Bc of this video, I give up my math
The n in the end is a number bigger then infinite
i think math is difficult
If school put this video I go to even if its sunday
What's the name of the song?
Épico Alan Becker enseñándonos matemáticas
I'm waiting to see if there is a math teacher to say that the animation worked well with the problems
The truly ultimate video with an amazinf storyline
Amazing!
bro i am a nerd i understood all of it lol.
Hi everyone i want u pls answer me Choose a letter V D M B
Math is evil
I love the way you animate math.
10:33 my man made the death star lol
I understood the first operation🙂
New young civilians when they just discovered math:
1 HOUR, ALAN BECKER SAY HELLO I'M A RE FAN😭🙏
Tutorial: How to make math more  interesting
What teachers think will happen if you study math
Alphant lore into math lore
dude this arithemathic and insane
Никто: Ничего: Рыжий, что познал высшую математику с нуля за 14 минут: Тот самый гениальный парень во всех вселенных
I hope school learn from you……
when I missed 1 lesson at school hahaha
this what we goin through during math class 😭
математика геймплей: ну там циферки буковки прочие символы математика лор:
4:56  45
I dont understod but I like it :D
Я не думал что математикай можно дратса орендживый >гений всех времён
What's the name of the song?
I have + no words = so is this what happened when he does math
As someone who has taken multiple calculas classes the accuracy and detail in this animation is insane. Well done. Although a great animation is nothing less of what I'd expect of Alan Becker and his team.
what this video tells us is that if we become good at math we will be able to make super nuclear weapons with mathematical formulas
im not late!!
damn this thing is amazing please make a part2
waow
I want to see another like that
시험기간 최고의 영상
How can someone actually make math look... Fun?
As someone who is fond of mathematics, I’m blown away by how accurate the details are !
24+42
The second coming learning math
Now this give me more reason to let math be my no. 1 subject.
It's the best battle between orange stickman and e ^ iπ
Alan has real talent! manages to make an animation out of mathematics!
dang orange getting smart fast and making it seem so easy and fast, i bet he's even smarter than me 😭
Ha and they say math is not fun 😊 100%.
I would love to see the behind the scenes on this one, the creativity here is on another level
Idk anything about math ngl but goddaum this shit epic 🔥 🔥 🔥
guys be honest, who wants a part two where TSC and the gang come back to this math place to help the math people (idk what they are)
How they make math look fun
Так вот для чего может пригодиться высшая математика😅
i feel like this is gonna be very popular after a year
that was amazing Alan!
I learned about radiuses in high school with the cos radiuses in clockwise formations from different pi and sin positions, THANK GOD IT WAS ONLINE LEARNING cause it sucked
Bro, get real, these animations were super complex!
Your animation always amazed me Alan! Especially for this one, it's truly Amazing! Love it so much! ❤❤🔥🔥
1+1 is ¹ cuz yes
oooohhhhhhh too much math
Uh en el Mundo real las Matemáticas son normales pero para en el canal de ALAN BECKER , las Matemáticas son como armas a ese tipo de calculo
s
Man i hope that part two has orange exploring fractals
my brain!
If i were orange, I will do multiplication with 0.
I was expecting at the end for it to be a dream, and orange would wake up in his Minecraft bed, and we’re did orange teleport to? Maybe back to Minecraft world?
its really cool how they can turn something as simple as math into something fun
Bro tried making me do math in my summer break
that is awesome!!!!!!
Screw school. I'll learn math by watching this.
MATH
This is the best animation you've ever posted. It is so nerdly and I love it! You are an awesome guy Alan!
Im legit gonna show this video to my math teacher and ask him to explain 2 high school grad btw
Wow😮
Alan what did you smoke?
There aren’t a lot of people who could make an animation about math cool and entertaining
Yoo every math teachers need to watch this
If I was a math wiz this would be 10 times cooler than it already is
When was math interesting?!
I wonder did Alan did all of this by himself
Keep it Alan becker we will support you man this is very good !
Who would have thought that math could be so much fun? It turned out great Alan 👍🏼
Bro created a new demension with math. 🤯
This is the best thing math has ever been.
My teacher say:math its very cool
How could you just manage all these match @@
Math teacher cannot even solve all these Mathematical equations, bro make my brain big on this funny video☕💀🔥👍🏻
Let's hope this doesn't become a fight for the fate of the world with special ultra powerfully blocks that cause black holes
Cool
great work, i kinda wish this was a game
I need to rewatch this when I’m older
This should be a short film shown in theatres
My question is, since orange learned the equations so quickly, he learned faster than anyone in the world
i need part 2!
4:20  I like how he reverse the direction of him using the negative
This is why akan backer use glasses 💀
ok so wheres binary and hexadecimal class?
my honest euler identity to that information:
What the flip was that?
Math lore:
That was amazing! we need a sequel where animation finds aleph. that would be insane
Hmm… wow😮😮
didnt know math teachers been goin through this shi 💀
what an animation
I am... so... SO... afraid of this mans pure creativity...
how did e & animation so stonger????????????
Like is that a human e 4:09
Alternative title: orange learns math
X be like: sasageo, sasageo
Brilliant video
Me: Mom! I've Got an A from math. Mom: oh good, how did you do that honey? Me: don't ask me how...
this is FIRE🔥
100000000000/10🎉🎉
Dude Alan's animation is on the next level
What was the banging at the end?
Math lore:
That was cool as hell! too bad i only understood like 39% of it.
oh no math
...welp...don't need to sit hours in a classroom, anymore. Now I have a reason to sit on YouTube all day lol
كل الرياضات التي تعلمتها في حياتي = 14 دقيقة
no no no no
how did u build math death Star my brain hurt..
He got lost in the calculator app lol.
What the hell letters doing in math? No, seriously. Why "e" trying to escape everytime SC summon them?
In today's video I use math to orbital strike my freinds!
I'm very stupid 🤤😭😭
Wow, la animación es increíble
if only cauculator worked like this id be using it for hours even tho i hate math
Mind-blowing also make animation vs physics
This teached me math faster that my entire semester (im grade 5 in the fourth quarter)
The consistency with the sound effects was great
It’s it a dream
I thought this was a cute way to teach some people math, then it started making me question my own math skills
Wow
The music sounds ominous...and it's math
it's summer and I'm back in school... cool 😔
I wish I could fully appreciate the amount of detail of this video
The moral of the story? PAY ATTENTION IN MATH CLASS AND STUDY HARD, KIDS.
calculator 2.0 the episode
Cool, but what is "+" ?
Amazing
I love it
I have a question did u take inspiration from Vsauce
Anjai! Wkwk 👁️👁️👍🏼
Im guessing This is for a school project
Hope TSC can bring all the things he learn from this world to the main one.
Perfect
Ora mudeng mtk mas
You teach me math
เจ๋งเลยอรัญบิ๊กเกอร์
Bro in the matrix and this is us vs math teacher
Oh man Bro I didn’t want to answer soon it would’ve been a fire series like animation versus Minecraft please make a part two Alan
math lore be like 😂
AESthetically pleasing math
I love this. I can only understand completely a third of the math presented here. But the fact that Alan made entire battles, wars, swords, and weapons out of just numbers and radiuses and equations is insane and SO creative. I cannot stop watching.
I napped too much, but the animation was good!
i don't know how much is the + end
Entendi porra nenhuma, mas parabéns pela animação! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
EVERYONE KNOWS 2+2=5
Let’s learn boys😂😂
the greatest video after the pokemon
I loved it. The way you can feel oranges thought process as he figures out how math works is amazing.
awesome
Math wars the video game (or movie whatever your take is)
What's 9+10?
Maynnn wth did i just watch🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯it was surely surely the best movie the best video the best ever animation I've ever seen in my life🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍love you alen😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Why did the e look like he was doing smash bros moves
that's incredible
as a person in year 8 i am beyond confused
Eulers Identity has become the villain
Bruh i don’t know aboude you but this is fing art and i personaly think this shud be like a film or some thing. “This is pure glass. You are a god damd artist”😂
the part at 8:40 could use some DOOM music ngl
Alternative tile  The math game
Wow if math was this mind blowing then it would have been my favourite subject I loved it Alan  I have been watching your videos since 4 years It has been such a nice journey I will always support you
if this was like animation vs minecraft the fights would be hella cool
Pls animation vs skibidi toilet
1024 3:22
More math u know more video u will understand
Visibly shuttered when imaginary numbers started to appear
Math: *Exists* My last 2 braincells fighting over territory:
Math is amazing and this animation managed to show that, the animation itself is beautiful and i love all the mathematical aspects that were shown all correctly and were understandable even if someone wouldn’t understand maths. Truly amazing work!
I wonder how he got where ever he is? I could see all this being inside the Calculator App tbh, if TSC decided to do math on himself without thinking it through, trapping himself in memory.
As a huge fucking math nerd I LOVED this video, you’re so real for making the math actually make sense
Math is the worst nightmare of my life 😭
That sure take at least two math teacher to help in this video
He’s too good at math
That mathematics dimensions...
I don't understand anything 😢
whats 9 + 10?
This was a very well done animation, and I like the idea of it.  Pls make more videos like these or make this a series. Thanks for reading this
Dude this is one of the coolest animations ever
Stickman memorized what I learned hard in 10 years in 14 minutes🙃
bro mastered the arts
my brain hurts
He is doing rocket science
no le des un programa de animación a un matemático por que ara una obra de arte
I don’t know at what part my brain broke, but my brain broke!
Never thought that math can look not only interesting, but also very epic. Most unusual, but cool animation i ever seen.
Nice
I feel that in order to understand the basic math, I will need to watch this video a decent number of times
This animation is amazing could you do a tutorial on how you do it?
Está demasiado bueno !!! Es una locura !
he needs to help the sick mans some time
Second coming I love u
Did orange used the Death Star?!
Question: 1  1 + 1 = ...    My brain:
Wha's the name of the song?
The war was like star war
Teacher: Why do you hate math?  What math did to me:
Man imagine all the hard work they put into making this fire animation! 😮
it's lovely
1+1=0+1+0+1=0+1+1=110=：」
In my opinion, the strongest one in mathematics are equal symbol, if they are not exist, numbers are useless and unable to created new ones. Not sure I’m extremely bad at math, if anyone denies this with good explanation, I can delete this comment.
is he playing with math?
Holy This is perfect 10/10
As someone who sucks at math, I don't exactly understand what is going on, but I do know that it's cool.
😪 very cool
I am lucky
this is like doodle god i love it
0:00 that intro goood
Ok so like I go to school  Math is literally my most hated subject  And then you wake up and suddenly make math Cool?  Like i just feel like i watched something on level with across the spiderverse and its  This is the best thing to wake up to
Bro make math epic
*SFX is Dope! Well done* 💜
Litrelly every class topper be like
Bro find letter i
Factorials would've been fun too haha Loved this vid Alan!
0:15 hmm yes the 1 here is made out of 1
cant wait for chemistry and physic
Never thought that math fight could be so amazing
Im sorry am I watching a video or watching a classroom?
Me during math class.
This is what I thought playing with math mean!
This episode was extremely enjoyable. I'm certain Alan could make a "Animation vs Literally Nothing" and find a way to make it interesting.
Another great animation
oooommmaaagaaaaahh
It's more educational than a math lesson
1+1=2
Very helpful. Although, I could have used it last year when I had to do these equations lol
im glad i understand most of these, makes it even more enjoyable
They made math actually look cool
All of those sound effects for combaning terms tickled my brain so perfectly. I love them
Wow! Just beautiful
Wait it says the video was uploaded 1 hour ago but why is there a comment 8 hours ago i don't understand
Bro took math to the next level
So math can be destructive
Omg this animation is really crazy… It can be a movie already😮
My last brain cell doing the math exam.
Now make a Math teacher reaction video of this.
teacher💀:  what​ 9+10​? mE: 21 ☕🗿
the best animation i ever seen
At what point in the video did orange's math transition from the realm of understandability to black magic frickery?
Bro learn faster than me
imagine a part 2 where the rest of the gang are here
Now I'm a math genius
1+1=9?
1+1=2
i didn't understand anything lmao i'm just a 7th grader
this is definitely something i needed rn. More adventures with this guy.
I can confirm that this animation makes me better at maths
A2 + b2 =c2
77 + 33 = 100
∞ ❤ π
Now for animation vs Science, Reading, history, and coding
1+1=2
2+x=4 x=2 0:49
Nice video. I love it! Thank you Alan. ❤❤❤
Everyone knows 1+1=window
TSC started with a one and somehow transformed it into a dimension breaking death star!
my head hurt watching all this math number and uuugh... i hate math
i think euler's constant REALLY hates tsc
I'm w8ing for another part with more complex math! It would be awesome! This is truly a masterpiece🔥
I love how you have both made almost every equation drawn out and right, as well as being able to teach math to Orange
I REALLY LOVE THIS
Hoes does this team always pull out bangers?
My brain stopped working
Dem it's so cool. Coolest math video ever.
π=3.1415926535
Give me part 2
How to learn math in just 14 minutes
This started from 1+1
1+1=😢
POV: kids who haven't done multiple, divide by, transformations, Pie x 2, 3D cubes with some crazy ass math i still haven't known to learn in school, and v x w = v = volume = w = width
Alan you are amazing, but why? It’s summer.. anyways, you’re amazing. Thanks for doing something none of us were brave enough to do this summer…. MATH.
All this math just fried my brain
10:01 You forget to do homework The teacher:
I want a video explaining all this
ארבע בחזקת -1 לא שווה ל0 אבל בסרטון זה היה שווה...
I cant believe that a simple 1+1 turnis into (cos)e*/⅙[9¡•390]
2:48 - wait, that's illegal
Bro this so heppy then teacher math
Why don't we learn so much in school
The music at the beginning sounds like it's from the game Portal 2
Bro explained whole maths in 14min and 2 sec🎉
Ayyyy advance math
1+1=2
I wonder if e will be back for the next clip of AvA
Удивительно, что видео Алана можно понять с любого уголка Земли, и для этого даже не нужны слова. БРАВО!
school ❎ youtube✅
Thanks man this video helped a lot for my calculus exam tomorrow
my brain cant load this video
This video has a better explanation unlike the one they teach us like c'mon man at least make it a little bit more livelier and not boring but this one wins the best movie like bro the LORE the CONFLICT the FIGHT tand the... MATH unlike other movies in which they just show how to shoot a gun without the explanation of how the frick they always get the right shot like what kind of vodoo magic is that but this. This shows all of the math I needed to understand
Imagine a game named "Animation vs." and this being one of the boss fights
oh.. my... god... this so special...😮
Due to Alan becker’s creativity on turning apps or games on computer to a portal to a different world with tons of personalities led to him being able to make math fun as in the only way we know.      Edit: And to be honest, I may even try using this to actually learn math someday
Bro it's too easy 1+1=1337
1+1=2  bruh
Alan somehow made math fun.
Alan can make a video in wich stickmen fight with literally anything in the world and that thing suddenly feels lile it is the most underrarted, coolest thing in the entire universe  (Dont get ne wrong, math is really amazing and absolutely mindblowing with all the equations and stuff it has but it felt like its even vooler than how it is in this video)
I learned more math in this video than in school
How did a video about math make me sad
Lol he tried to divide by 0 and seen why that was a bad idea
Holy shit, this was good.
if only number muncher had been as cool as this
Some of us have such small brains that we don’t even know what’s going on but for some reason it’s so much more easier to understand than in actual school
This is one of the best thing I watched, the love and the passion run in this video (sorry for my bad english)
He in calculator
Thanks engineering for having me understand about everything that happens within the video. Such an interesting way to display math! Gave me a good chuckle
You forget to do homework The teacher be like:
This man imagination pool is ♾️
Cool Math animation
Every1 knows that 9+10=21
Culadora modo harcore
why you don't do the episode 2 of animation vs animator ( after " wanted " )
1+1= 1,1
😐
Alan never fails to surprise us with his animations, Well done!
Ohh maths is just magic
The death star but in math
The real creator of Math was TSC
1+1 is 100% 11. Dont disagree,you wont have any excuses
Wth just happened
This i think is my favorite animation you guys have done, and its by a pretty wide margin. Truely amazing. I would love to see a game made out of this concept. It has the potential to be both truely entertaining and engaging (unlike most 'educational' games), and actually educational (also unlike many 'educational' games).
1+1 is 2048282944857292020 and yes i needed to calculated this question
Teacher: Your math score is "F". Me: *Turns "F" into machinegun*
I was not expecting this to be super cool and one of my favorite animations you done, but I am very happily surprised! This was super cool!
Moral of the story: don't ,earn algebra
Suddenly, I'm a math expert
No necesito verlo para saber que esta epico
WOW IT MATH MY FAVORITE
I want a calculator like this
Nice to Know that Sc is learning something
Wait a minute this looks very like the black stick figure vs clippy guy hummmm 4:41
By the way it's so awesome that it ended in like aleph null  and also 10/10 from a math interester 👏 to the omega
1:29 he got into the negatives
Alan Becker why does it take you so long to release a new video, you should make a video : 1 time per month, I really like your video
Алан Беккер настолько крут что даже из простой математики зделал эпичный бой и сюжет!
Please make a series on math 🙏
that was amazaing i loved it
7:19 good
i just love how orange is just playing with a calculator and we are so hyped about it lol, alan can make everything interesting, even math
This stickman legit created the death star using math.
I didnt know that math can be this fun
This video is just so yummy
They will become Easter Eggs in the next battle (e and 🍊)
my brain crashed
accurate representation of everyone's first experiences messing around with one of those high quality graphing calculators
me when i downloaded duolingo math:
This escalated exponentially
That's for story!
The math is so difficult 😅😅😅 And me and my brother need wanted ep 2 so please hurt 😊
I swear Alan Becker is the man who can take the most simplest things and turn it into lore
Я хочу чтобы этому предоподавали  в математике тогда точно будет мощная наука.😎👨‍🎓  И кстати музыка напоминает из фильма МОРСКОЙ БОЙ в 10:12 секунде.
This game my brain a syntax error
Thats hoy the cosen one make the portals?
SO ZETTA AMAZING!!
Orange broke math
Tsc: wait where am I… I guess I will figure it out I just have to figure some things out before I try to leave
I gotta show this to my math teacher
op
bro this was so cool❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
i will now watch this every time i learn a new lesson so when i get old i will be able to finnaly understand this masterpiece
evil maths strikes back
This was an amazing video that I did not understand at all. 12/10
Phenomenal  If math had been taught like this i might have learned something!
this is the coolest thing ive ever seen! cool video :V
So it is cannon now... very well made!
ngl this was fire
I wonder how TSC got there
just as i finish with math this video shows up
Unbelievable 🔥
¿Por favor cuanto falta Animador vs Animation VI Ep 2?
You forgot to include 9+10
Okay, we REALLY need someone to actually do the math on this, cause i lost track early in this video. I loved it though. Great video.
Now i understand math
“Hahaha I have absolutely no idea what’s going on” - Homer Simpson, and now, me
THIS WAS SO COOL PLS MAKE MORE LIKE THIS
eiπ  :3
betul betul betul😂😂😂
Bro am really bad in math
We absolutely need someone making a "Every math reference in Alan Becker's Animation vs. Math video" video
Fuck this is so cool looking forward to the sequel
Best maths lesson ever
Damn, that's some editing
Jesus, it’s better everytime and not stopping.
Si sabe cómo funciona es Albert asred
My right lobe of brain Vs My left lobe of brain I always have two brains for the answer
Animation vs terraria would be great. It would be cool to see them fighting some terraria bosses
Dang ,,,, this was so dang cool!
Arguing with math teacher be like 💀
Does the man actually check out?
students: how can we use math in real life? kid named alan becker:
1+1=2
Alan just teached me 12 years worth of school in less than 20 mins
Not only this is amazing and informative. I think it is also one of your most beautiful work yet!
bro is too powerful
보기만해도 머리가아프다
All of these numbers, methods and everything is making me go down the memory lane once again. Looks like my teacher's mathematical lessons finally paid off. 😅
Math😵‍💫
This is such a deadly thing for me.. I cannot handle it please
Part 2 please
Classic nerd moment
:0
Bruh I think I up my iq to +10
Bro made a deathstar using math
math, the final endboss at school
pov my dreams after studying whole night to pass math(i did(suprisingly)):
Then what is 397×13=?😊
Part 2 please
Alan genius!
for the first time in 15 years of my life, I became interested in mathematics
Did this dude actually do all that math?!
You probably just made math like a million people's favorite subject now
OMG AWESOME
Bruh i am 1 hour late from live stream
I swear Alan is just a machine that takes in ideas and churns out beautiful animation and stupendous sound design! Everyone involved with this project (and others) deserves the best!
I wished school went by that quickly.
my man some how made math fun
Como esse vídeo pegou 560 mil views em 1 hora ????
A what?
animation vs minecraft
I love the sound design
damn... just AMAZING :0, need + like
Как всегда божественно. Каждое видео всё равно что произведения искусства. Жду следующих видео.🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
hola alan
Alan! Can you make a "Animation vs physics" or Science??????????????
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🔥🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠👍🤌🤌🗿
i cant wait for a mathematician youtuber to react to this
Math 1 The Sigmas invation
Wow bro, that was amazing
"You bro, did you study for the finals?" "Dont worry I watched that Alan Becker video"
Я не чего не понял я только 5 класс закончил
So cool
bro learned math faster than i ever could in my whole life…
wow
Early gang ↓
didn't understand anything but still very cool
Everyone in school: you can’t make math fun Alan Becker: (pulls out uno reverse card)
It feels like this should be a game
8:20 my knowledge ended here
Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Funny  comments about 1+1=11
and my division of zero by zero
This is awesome 🎭. You did it you made math fun and exciting !!
Is canon?
It amazes me that Alan managed to make weaponry out of math
Bro things he Albert Einteins💀 Bro things he newton isaac💀
now THIS IS a reason for understand math, it's like if all my study progress was reflected on this video
Es el juego que juega richad en el increible mundo de Gumhall
This is somehow the dumbest and coolest idea
1+1=                         100
2+2=5 its ez
10:01 Dark Souls
The sound is next level in this one. The cleverness is unparalleled, this may be my favorite Alan Becker video to date.
พี่สอง
1+1=2
1+1=3
to do. tarpon😊
Finally! Math is fun! *starts shooting the math symbols
9:48 like battle in dark soul 😅😅
Is it normal that I have understood everything that TSC was doing?....
Man this stuff is just crazy good! Love it!
stay in school, kids, it makes you better at military warfare
Wish this was reality tbh
I feel like I understand math now
i feel so bad for the ones
Dang 566k views in 1 hour? Thats crazy
As an Asian math nerd, I love this video
OH NO NUMBAS ALL I KNOW IS THAT 2 + 2 = 5!
12:08  Orange : "Let's be friends, please!! 🙏" e^(i×pie): "Bro, you just start a literal war..."
Where's he's brothers?😂
peak
This stick figure and mathematical letters had a better fight scene than any film, show, or other piece of media I've seen before
2
How 1 feel doin ma1h
All match in 14 mins
imagine a saga of this, and the next one being physics
Animation vs Minecraft please
e is dangerous as well as interesting at the same time!
too much mathematics
Best 14 minutes and 2 se onda of my life
when I see the ending why Iam feel sad 😭😭
Alan Becker the only human on the planet that can make me interested in math.
Im witing for the Mathematician and teacher react to these Video....
Alan becker, the only man capable of being able to make me actually watch over 5 seconds of maths
I came to this video for help on my homework. The comments where not helpful…
I feel like i understand more math like this than anything else in class probably cause it actually made it more interesting rather than a lecture and paper and showed some very interesting things with different ways to look at the equations
ONE
I never thought math was so much fun
On a Saturday during break from school really
Alan is the only person that can turn math into a real well written story
Whoa
2:30 im already confused
Alan : How much of this math do you know? Me and of course my brain who only have 3 braincells :
Wow math is very simple(in an epic way) in this epic video 1-2(3×1)×1=-5 (math is cool)
i like to imagine alan made this for his kid
dont let the teachers see this because then we cant use the age old excuse "when are we ever gonna need this?"
In korea 1 + 1 = window
Math had never looked so cool
desire to do mathematics ⬆️⬆️⬆️⬆️
Fantastic
The details and logics is just so cool plus the animations it makes the the video really nice and clean. Everyone should rate this  a 5 star video
Сейчас я учусь в художественном ВУЗе. У меня математика последний раз было 2 года назад... Поэтому я уже ничего не помню из математики и почти ничего не понимаю из этого видео. Но знаю что оно просто прекрасно 😍
Это джо джо референс, потому что они пытались убить бруг друга а потом закарешились😂
Amazing!
This is awesome, I want someone to teach me math like this
Day by day you raise the level of animation in the world even more. You know what, I would like to write your name down in a historical form, not just in digital media but even more so that it may last longer. Something tangible and of course doing it in all languages ​​is not easy. I hope people in the future still see English as a necessity. Alright, now I'll consult with someone who has the same idea as me. and finally, You're someone on the same level as Herodotus.
Вот что значит переиграл в калькулятор 😂😂😂
Ty for commenting on the latest young quarters episode 🤭
Aprendio mas que yo en todo un año xd
I really don't like doing math, but if my math classes were like this, it would definitely be my favorite.
Eso esla matetica dela nasa
WHAT
So all of math is used for animators and their animations
Math teachers are gonna love this lol
Lest learn Math with Alan
This better than common core.
hold on.. 7:18 the names of the letters: cos and i sin   now why does that sound like "cause i sin“
I think I learned more math watching this video than all my math classes I’ve ever taken combined
My brain in math
1
I just saw this
Man just tried rediscovering the entire fundamentals of math in like 10 minutes, then learned math is why we have weapons of mass destruction.
Even with literal math equations he’s still able to make top tier animation
+1
from now on my favorite formula is ⨍(∙)
New York yo teach math
THİS İS AWSOME
I want full game of this
88 + 22. No one can solve that
Trailer on how Asia was made
Waaaa
How make everyone use their brain but also fun to watch
Bro it so much “brain” 🤯🤯🤯
That was awsome
TSC fully understood calculus in like 10 minutes I wish I could relate
i didnt know math could get this dangerous, and might also be second coming 's(orange) lore too on that one specific episode of A vs MC
Math teacher's dream💀
Why is it that everywhere i look i see math?
high school math would've been so much easier if I had this
Bro all this math is making my brain hurt 😟
9 plus ten
if you showed me this video a year ago i would have understood a lot more of it than i do now
Only Alan can make math funny
wow 500k views in 1 hour already?
Who would have thought
if i could actually understand more than just the basics i would be a lot more entertained
XD
As an "early-algebra boi," I can confirm that everything in this video are fantastically accurate.
💗💗💗😻😻😻👍
this just feels like alan is showing off (again) how good his animation skills are even though he's animating numbers and variables to make the most interesting math video possible
Alternative title: Teaching all mathematical models with Stickman 😂
Orange got one more skill, named math.
The last part looks so cute like a family
You know what 5/10 + 5/10 equals too, because that's the rating of this video
Now do animation vs Science
But where all of like green yellow red and blue
This insane bro,this animation can be a movie 🎉
No meio eu parei de entender (estou no 6 ano ) no fim parece o meio
1+1=2
Quick math!
The fact that this all starts from 1+1....  Alan might be even more skilled than we last assumed.
''Math is an unconquerable problem. Because it will conquer your brain first before you solve the problem.''
This is so beautiful ❤️
damn I always loved math but this is some fucking next level shit. I mean this is legit an excellent way to teach math, it's a very good visualization of how math work, well played
NO WAY, ANIMATION VS MATH IS OUT!!
at first I understood, but then I stopped understanding
this guy has just made an orbital laser beam
But i love math it's fresh mood because this you get a different level enjoyment ❤❤❤
1 + 1 = 3
Soon, this Video will get millions of views!
this is SUPER weird like here a my questions where is orange how did he get there and what was that thing make the large footstep sounds
And he's never gonna see a person like that again
All the cool kids are gonna hate this.
bro I missed your videos
In my brain there was a monkey doing music while y watch the video
so this is a very good way to explain why anything cant be diveded by zero in 2:53
I learn in this video…  Intelligens = creativity  Creativity = Good ideas  Good ideas = piece of art like this animation  Study Kids
The creativity though and the  fact that I end up learning this in Secondary school is just insane. Love your videos dude.
that shit was made by dreams work
Student hate math when there is a exam be like
Buddy if they showed this in school, it would be very fun and entertaining  This is epic  Math Club gonna increase its size
OMG new video
1+1=1000000000000000
I’m sending this to my math teacher.
I wanna see more of e and math as a superpower
WHAT THE CRAP JUST HAPPENED
4:42  TSC: THE POWER OF ADDITION COMPELS YOU!!
The creativity here is on another level!
alan and the team can make ANITHING fun to watch and fight
What school teaches you versus the test be like what school teachers who is in the first equations
It's so wonderful
Others: math is dull  Alan Becker: 😎
1+1=7
When ur friend say u pro math Me:1+1=1+1-1-1+1+1-1=11
I KNEW THAT I KNEW THAT MATH IS EVIL❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗❗
He know how to make math looks fun
Is this still technically part of the AvA series since the last time we saw TSC he was being placed in what looked like a simulation stage?  Wait, just realized its the chosen one whos on the simulation stage
数学の神秘！！
really cool animation
So…. I know I’m not the only one who may need some context explaining everything. I’m fairly sure a lot of that was calculus and trigonometry. But maybe make a follow up giving some kind of context to things?
♾️ + ♾️ = 16
I’d say this was a good way to show the power of infinity
Please animation vs science
if only i can learn math as fast as he does
Holy shit that very good
A masterpiece, like always. Using math, really cool, your team and you did a great job.
This is so smart like s.m.r.t
math is a such
Drama & Action Math animation 🤓🤓
A more nice animation
Math is now funny to watch😅
If were maths lessons, be like be sure math would be our favourite subject
my guy broke math
This is real complex math guy's lol
It just turned into star wars.
So.... Did TSC fall into the windows calculator or...? Because while the fight was awesome, even if some of the more complex math near the end lost me, I can't help but wonder how the hell he got there. And where that exit lead.
Epico
数学が苦手な人でも数学者になれる動画
Oh my god, mathematics is the best. After watching this animation, it's amazing. Immediately fell in love with mathematics. 1+1=?
I understand this.
Bro made confused my mind and tricked it so much😅❤
This animation is so PEAK
Sends maths to an entirely new level of annoying but in the end u just decide to agree
No one can scare me.. but that thing .. that’s scares me
Somehow he made  orange learn all kinds of math quicker than Albert Einstein.
this is incredibly cool
math nerds gonna have a field day with this one
We need to see other mathemathical symbols like the golden ratio. We need part 2.
Ima take a calculator for this one.
Nobody:  Me and the boys in math class:
When your parents want you to become a mathematician but you want to become animator:
Ще ніколи математика не була такою цікавою.
The+end= Th2end
So, this is why you deserve more subscribers, intelligence
I like math
I'm watch this vdo,it make me knowss mate too much ,ty alan
Imagine if humans could visually interact and use numbers/maths like this 😯
Now With this Video I'm Learning Math! Awesome Video Alan! ❤
I just lerned math in 14:02 minutes. That's a realy good animation.
if TSC could do this, then he might be very powerful boi.
Aaaa. all of this math animations. Rly messes with my head up its setup. But still some how make since
How tf Math got hands tho?
1+1=32
MY HEAD EXPLODED 🤯 I WAS Setting LIKE A DOLL LOOKING SHOCKED😢😂
Amazing work!. It felt like a short film made for a college final from a group with pure passion for their work. And don't get me started on the animation or the attention to detail!
10:33 he literally just made a death star
The thing I hate is that I understand ALL of the calculations
OMG ITS SOOOOOOO FREEEAAKIIING AMAZING💥💥
engineering dreams be like:
Everyone loved alphabet lore... *So the sequel is here*
1+1=2😥🖑🖐
1+2 is 4
ok but the aleph null in the background at the end
●/ \ ●\ /
Every body knows 1+1 is 11.
That made me learn toooooooo much...
Overhead
I feel like I just...learnt something...
I know I am hoping for the impossible but I hope there would be a Animation vs Math 2
it actually looked like everything was accurate. i just didn't get the small circle of numbers when there was an explosion here: 00:08:11
Somebody send this to threeblueonebrown
Yee
I learned more about math here than in all of high school
...BRO me die with dat man
WOW
This is pretty cool! I want to see something like Animation Vs …well… any another video game character next!
역대급이네 와 진짜 잘만들었다
This hurts mi brain just watching it urghhh🤢
Why does the math universe have the most powerful weapons in existence  Also I wonder what the - ending is if this is the + ending 🤔
I'm sure this is something I would draw in my math textbook😂
That's so cool
alan is an absolute genius
1:40 Villain is introduced.
Bro finally decided to stop milking Minecraft 💀
OMG Alan, you are amazing!
people who are good at math will love this video :)))
Glad to see aleph in the end.
alan turned math into a game💀
bro learned math in like 14 minutes
Hear me out-  1 x 2 = 3 But 2 x 1 = 4
Genius using all those functions
he is a ginuis
This video is if a nerd had an imagination.
This animation teaches me more math than my math teacher in middle school
I like the video :D
well. that was awesome. spooky, but awesome.
I want to see how other YouTuber reaction to this mind blowing
feel sorry people who don't know math
Bro learns quicker than me
This has probably been the most fun and easiest for me to learn mathematics.
1+1=1
We need a mathematician to react to this and be impressed by its accuracy
Bro taught me more math than school 💀
This is the best YouTube channel I’ve ever seen in my life. I enjoy every minute of it.
This feels like s spinoff show
0+0=1
spaesh
TSC is finding the truth of this world by using maths 🤣🤣💀💀 Also thanks Alan u give us maths that complex💀💀
wow
Epic😮
Now it's time for everybody's favorite subject... MATH! -baldi's basic
What a fun way to learn math you dont know yet
Only one question. What it was in the end? I mean, what is this black symbol like N mean?
chai mean tea bro
This whole thing is irrational.
idk a litle
Orange will pass yellows every redstone build in 1.4 seconds
A yes the mortal enemy of Humans!
Now fill in that it all started with 1 + 1
im surprised there was no divide by 0.
Amazing😲
I lost all my braincells watching this but it's worth it

... sin palabras...
As a person who never was very fond of maths, I must say that I did not understand absolutely anything. But hey, the weapons are cool.
Was he inside a calculator or something?
and that's how to kill math then be its friend, but your brain would be dead forever
Your animation is soooo good like how?!  Oh also if lets say there was a game like this am pretty sure alot of people would play it like you use math to get guns or something like that or use i do teleport like one game can be math or aothere can be like a battle royal or something
Orange is a great math teacher maybe ill go to his private classes
im proud to say i understood the math part of the first 10 seconds of the video
Souls boss fight material right there
You should do e vs the dark lord/ king orange
Another classic of youtube is born today folks.
2+2 is 22.
alan becker videos always amazes me
What
Ah, my favorite subject.
Bros making MATH and hes touching it Vr in math be like
I finished my final exam of school, and seeing this is fascinating. Animating math is unique, because it show equations, prisms etc. in a different way, more creative.
10:02 best part ngl
I hate math:)
its great! :D
The second coming is better at math than me
POV: you know nothing about math
Video này cho thấy alan giỏi toán :))
This video made me cry over a math equation, except in a good way this time.
It like a maths class 😅
Every time you upload it makes me say “This is best Alan has ever done”. I just can’t explain the excellence of your videos. I admit that all of your videos are extremely great, none is inferior than the other all of your videos even the old ones and your shorts are equally best.
What the-?
Now im sure that math was invented only for Allan Becker to make this video
I lost my braincells after this video.
School Teaching Math = Boring Alan Becker making an animation about Math = *Interesting, let’s keep watching.*
Alan never disappoints
Can we please get more subjects
How is this possible Views 😮
The + End = Fin
This is the coolest animation that ypu have made i love every one of them
Dam just damn
The end.
Amazing video Alan Becker!!😄
Summer is here XD
Me when I finally got my first calculator
Хоть я нелюблю матиматику  Но это очень круто 💖
IM SO CONFUSE
1 + 1 is 11 in Roman
I love math
Dam just damn
The video is great now I learned math easier
Absolutely beautiful
Alan is the only person that can make a video of math that people can actually enjoy
this man really made me want to learn math
literally me in the math class
this video is satisfying
😮😮😮😮
This shit. Was so friggin clever. My god, my brain imploded.
Thanks for helping me discover that I am attracted to intelligence and creativity
‏‪13:46‬‏ א!

10÷3=
Hello😊 i really love your animations
I always loved the ideas behind your animation from multiple years of experience...but this...this was truly awesome. If this gets a continuation with all the other characters beside from TheSecondComing...then it'd be just insane. 😁
My school year just ended and I thought I knew some decent math...  What the hell did I kust watch, I understand like 3% of it 😅
Hope this got ep 2 ….kinda interesting
א
You did not need to put that much effort into this
Oh no the worst enemy to fight against.......math
this is such an amazing video
This was on of the best animations from Alan becker
Bro 1+1 isnt hard, And yet He still turned it into a mess
This will take more time than the animating to get the whole video ._.
I can’t feel my brain, thank you alan
2+2=fish
this needs to be the new school!
"Math professor reacts to Animation Vs Math" when?
I love it. It was perfect. From start to finish, and the little details!
Ho else din't understand shit but was equally intertein?
Everything’s cool and good until Alan pulls out calculus
man if i learnt match like this i would become einstein in no  time. Worlds best action math video :D
Question.Why 10 + 10 = 11 + 11?
Wow
I love maths and just seeing this made my whole entire year.
My friend shared with me this video on a whim and when I very quickly realized from the name who I was working with, watching a stick figure go ballistic on -1 with pi digit explosions... It's amazing how you've taken a concept from damn near 17-18 years ago and not only haven't gotten bored of it (somehow) but polished it to modern perfection.  I have nothing but applause EDIT: Learning how much it's evolved into an entire team gives me nothing but applause for *everyone* on board with this - it's astonishingly easy to believe from much of the channel branding that it's a one man show, but it's evolved on a crazy scale
next Animation vs. Physics
1＋1＝田
TSC out here being the new Einstein
1 + 1 is 11, but in Greek
My question is, did the team actually have to learn different parts of math again?
AMAZING
So many numburs
Became better at math in 15 minutes then I could in 20 years 😭
Everyone knows 1 + 1 is 🐟
This guy is a fucking genius
Man I wish this was math class bro
Alan needs 25 subs.
DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
Bro almost destroyed math 💀
Nice!
I thought he was gonna beat up the numbers
1 + 1 is 🪟
I cant say I understood most of this. A lot of the stuff utilised I didnt learn in school, but this was absolutely great. I can tell that this took a LOT of thought, this was just SUPER creative and I love it.
This will be the video cool math teachers show their class
Bro divided 0
it feels like portal
1+1 equals nothing. maths isn’t real. If you have escaped the matrix you would understand. If you have one drop of water and u add another, it is still the same. Same to this, 1+ 10828 drops of water. Still same.
1+1=2
eu ja odeio matematica ai se vem um isso mim fez odeia mas a inda kk
This man made math have a personality, now that's just impressive beyond impressive.
1. Алан не хочу тебя этим обидеть но почему ты меня игноришь всегда!? 2. Где: 🔵😊🟢🎵🟡👓🔴🥴
Bro learned how to hack😂
How dare you make math look cool
I'm just waiting him to divide by zero Edit: very underwhelming
Every asian math teacher be. Like
This video explains on how Albert enistin was born
Master mathematics. Master time and space.
never did I think I would enjoy math.
next video should be animation vs science
😵‍💫
This video casually teaching us everything we learned from elememtery and middle school in the span of like 5 seconds be like
When i realize that a orange stick figure learned math in 14 minutes while i take 10 years
question: how did alen make an fighting animation with math and stick figures????
7:08 Is so cool
I start love math from this video😶
math 3000%
If you don't like math watch this video
This is not something I should have watched half an hour after waking up.
흥미롭군
Someone needs to do a brief explaination of this because dayum everything is happening at the same time.
I never understood math 😅
1+1 2
Whenever I Study Maths This All Fight Happens In My Mind🤧
I love maths🥰
No 2
Maths + dark souls
siiiiiiiiiiuuuuuu
My brain hurt
i understood none of this
how i wish math was like
10:01 WAA 😩
I'm still don't understand how Orange went to the Math World haha, excellent video as always!
I wish math was this cool
At this point we need a multiverse series
Ok i am to stupid to under stand most of this so forgive me for not knowing the hammer of Dawn was apparently a f****** mathematical equation 11:06
The moral of this story is that time travel is possible with team work
Me processing Math logic in this °^°
Alan: now that this is done time to do animation vs history (AvH)                                                   Thats only my guess lol
Only if math is this fun 😢
2+2=5
@just_baggy no its 5
Why the stick mans are so intelligent they learn so fast
Bu kadar çok minecraft oynayınca, matematiği çözmüş stickman🔶
Physical education student: easy Mathematics: bruh that is so hard
Someone give this guy an Academy Award!
That's incredible and gorgeous. The sound design is perfect and the animation is so smooth and fluid. All the equations are accurate and right. Everything is perfect!😮
Math is truly the most powerful force in the universe
This is not how math works xD
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
This is amazing
Un Excelente video . Einstein estaría orgulloso.
Now i know someone will make a program about math with graphics that work like this, so we'll do math the fun way. I just know it!
No wonder math is so hard...it's always A BOSS FIGHT
Cool
Hello
Just completed my Algebra2 course for my junior year. This is the best reward.
Now i know what math is for
How tf did Orange get there?
My brain not responding
we want more!!!! :D
Je veux une suite please Alan Becker
Mano é fácil pensa seu pai = 1 sua mãe = 1 e eles teve gêmeos então 1 + 1 = 5
Heres my prediction like in the series that finished a couple months ago, I think that orange is going to revisit this world when they get separated or something
This is really a good animation and story even with just a simple topic which is math. Next try to Programming language? HTML and Javascript?
bro just speed ran math and it wouldve made math everyone’s favorite subject
love math
Collab with mathantics PLEASEEE
If math was this epic, I would actually look forward to math class
Y’know, I Watch YouTube to escape from school… BUT THIS….
this was 1 hour ago and 88k likes and 9.9k comments
OK, I don't know if ANY of that works (or half the symbols) but that was pretty cool.
i think my brain just exploded
11:37 when discord dark mode is invading light mode🤣😂🤣
OMG! This masterpiece probably has more math than whatever school taught us. √-1 bet this video educate me more than what school did!   I can't wait the algebra video 🔥🔥!
미친걸까ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Stickman Einstein is born
cách học toán thú vị
if alan backer could make a stickman fight something with some symbols entertaining than i wonder what he would do with symbols but for speaking
students: Math is boring  me: *proceeds to create a fight scenario*
Great video that I can't understand
I love math
Never in my entire life have I ever known how to solve math
/e sleep
I am an industrial engineering student and oh.boy. dude, that was amazing!!!! All the references and formulas, many ways to represent euler powered, that pesky number is everywhere. The representation of the limits, all the elements of the sumatory in order, the aurea region, dude. Wow, wow, wow, definitely showing this to my mates.
That's a very well done animation
I learned more about math from this video alone, than I did in 12 years of school.
Omg your creativity level is 1+1+98=100
Как сделать атомную бомбу в домашних условиях

I can't believe he made math fun.
Creative
THEY JUST FİGHTED WİTH MATH PROBLEMS. I HATE MATH BUT  WOAH
0_•
math war
This should be used in schools lol
4 years of uni are left behind, so i know all of these math)
holy shit I knew you were talented, but this is next level!
you r the best animator for me thx for videos
I don't really know how you guys were able to pull this off but i do know it is some insane stuff

good animation forever
0 ÷ ∞
So let me get this straight. Orange needed 5 minutes to understand graphing trigonometry. And it took me 11 years.
I’m only now realizing when Second gets home he is going to flex so much
Amazing animation but need to know HOW DID ORANGE GET INTO THIS MESS. 😂
Solo Alanbeker es capaz de hacer que las matemáticas se vean divertidas
주확색이 Awesome. Joo Chak-saek is good at math...
Eg
Imagine a math teacher put this on in class
1+1=3🥶🥵😮👍🥶🥵🥶👍🥶
I think this taught me more about math than my grade 12 math class, absolutely stunning animation as always
pov: 2 smart people fight
My mind every math subject:
there in a calculator? or not
Math vsstick
You increased me intereses to Math, thank you, Alan Becker
Why need school when alan does these videos
Alan flexing his cleverness
As someone who took a lot of math classes in school, I can appreciate just how much research this must have taken. Amazing animation as always!
1+1=1+1
Is this the first video where orange is the ONLY stick figure THE ENTIRE VIDEO. (Yes I know orange was pretty much the only one in AvA 4, but the others where at the beginning and end.
when is episode 2 of chosen one gonna come out?
1+1 is 2 so easy
What!?!
IT WAS AMAZING I JUST CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW MUCH I LOVE IT. I really love math and this year im going to university i am so excited to learn more about imaginary numbers they are so strange but also wonderful and this episode is sooooo good because its about one of my fav subjects. Math+Alan becker=🩵
I know is 2?
Amazing!!
But the Math is bad, it’s very, very BAD.
Haha, I understood none of this! :D  Entertaining as hell tho
This gave me Vietnam flashbacks to calculus
Когда нибудь я пойму все в этом видео
Is just me or this is a really good animation.
Who else thinks that the math teacher should show us this?
Hey guys
bro its a war
Bro is playing the Calculator Game that Richard Watterson played
I don’t know all If this but Alan this is insane❤❤❤
Mano miha mente bugou

One of the best videos of this channel
POV: me wanting to stay home math be like:
my head: (nothing right now)
With this we have managed to prove that Alan is good at math and I also managed to prove that I am lousy😅
Top ten anime battles of history.
Quién diría que ver a un stickman haciendo ecuaciones sería tan interesante
And pls do wanted animator part2
MATH LORE
my brain didnt worked after this
This animation is very clean.
Second did you got taller and your head is a bit smaller
If only all calculators looked like this…
How this man mqde a fight whit the math
Oh hey, my whole life math knowledge is finally being used.
you teach math better than schools also amazing animation!!!!!!!!!
I don't know bro why it is so complicated but I like this video😅
Leave it to the legend Alan Becker to math into an anime style battle that rivals the like of Dragon Ball and other Shonan anime
what the fuck are they smoking can i get some pls
Wow he makes math look fun
i hope this fighting "style/system" returns in the future, its super satisfying and really cool
i dont understand a single thing the orange guy is doing 🔥🔥🔥
Please make a part 2 where the other animations go inside
when orange gains the knowledge of einstein
They GOTTA do an app like this
Pov: your math teacher
0:17 1=1
And also why is orange in the void
Aleph 0 rellay is math final boss.
Oh no..This is the most Horrible Enemy they had to deal with..The thing that destroys my Brain and Exams..MATH.😱
Ok this now became mandatory in math's classes. Globally.
This video was very good
The creativity put into these animations never ceases to blow me away. I especially loved the sound design for this animation. Kudos to the whole team!
as a math nerd, i love this
This is educational math lol
Me encanta tu contenido
Que incrível!!😍
POV. Me in math
Oh no..This is the most Horrible Enemy they had to deal with..The thing that destroys my Brain and Exams..MATH.😱
What 9+10=
DUMMY HA HA HA
Dear Math why don’t you solve your own problems?
4 minutes in and this is the best maths video I've seen. And I'm a mathematician.
My brain was all out of juice on the 6 minute timestamp of the video
Can we all agree this would be one fire sandbox game, if any game devs see this can you take this video as a game inspiration, please?
Someone trying to solve depression:
it was a bold move to include the unicode character that became a symbol for zoophiles in this. you were quite brave!
This video came out 1 hour ago
wow that is cool
Art 🎨
I love how everyone knew before watching this video is that it would descend into mathematician madness
The fact that everything makes sense and when that battle scene where the swords were numbers and the smaller numbers broke dew to the bigger ones was cool
hi
This animation teached me more math than high school and college combined by +2
Bro call me dumb in stick figure language
数学好きが大興奮
It’s not Math, it’s Maths
One Plus One Equals OneOne
Part 2
After this video i more like math
idk what I just watched but it was beautiful
I can feel my self get mentally smarter, School sucks.
Only time im focusing about math tbh🗿
W
\O/
The sound effects are just so crunchy dude
I’m so bad at math.
I can't believe were gonna learn this in school
Hopefully teachers will use this video to teach their students lol
Me fighting with my homework:
it's so fantastic!!!!!
Unironically, something like the beginning with all the playing around with numbers and math in an open space would be a sorta cool “Im bored” vr game, seeing how different math works like multiplications and division in a 3D space, and how complex equations could play out just messing with numbers.
omg i want math teachers to react to this
Greatest episode
Damnn this is sooo good 💗🔥 Wish we had a vr game like this ...
damn, and all of this was correct too
1+1=3!
This really feels like Alan's old animations, before they became a series. Something exists, it gets explored, big fight, bigger fight, biggest fight, then end. No context, nothing. Except, now the quality of animation is something exceptional.
This just hurts mt head but i love tge sfx and music
I am😂😂
次は文字ですね
me before watching: who needs math? after watching: math is so cool!
1 hour ago and its really idk.
is alan just gonna flex his entire knowledge about math on us
this is a movie
Oh no I missed it 😞
Honestly, this is the best video i have watch this month so far
I  don't know why, but this is beautifull
I hate math but why do you have to make math so cool
INCREDIBLE !!!!!! It's pure genius !!! REALLY!!!! Juste keep going, It's awesome !!
does that mean The Chosen One dies or escaped?
Alan Becker teaching me more math in 14 minute than an math teacher has in a period

Seeing Aleph makes me very scared if SC fought it.
Animation vs History?
Epic animationn
Next Video Idea: Animation Vs Meth
my doodles in maths class:
Bro has be an albert enstein
TSC has just learned all the math we learn in 12 years in 12 minutes
this is what happens to my brain during exams
1+1 is 2
I have no idea what's happening but i like it
Bro found a way to make math entertaining
Я слишком тупой для таких мультиков
What ep2😢
This is how engineering students dreams are like.
This animation is so sick
Alan becker could make a stickman fight a literal ATOM and it would still be amazing
I have no clue whats the other thingy are aside from the basic.... XD
i hate math but good video
1+1 is window(?)
This is one of those things I didn't know I needed in my life-

Dude,i'm bad at math but i like the animation
As a child, I do not understand most of these

He's making my brain outnumber
this is the best video I've ever seen, I swear, you made me want to study math to understand certain things in the video that I haven't studied yet   thank you for being so badass! 🤝
O humble Master, can you teach me Maths?
Nah 1+1=2
Only Alan Becker could make a video on math entertaining
Second Coming is immune to motion sickness
That cloning thing had to have been an exploit!
my theory is: The second coming is now in illusion in this whiteroom where is the chosen one
I loved this. Probably my most favorite one so far.
goddamn this is cool
wow amazing
Wow fantastic 😊
Everyone knows that 1+1=11.
Bro was in the void 💀💀💀
Best ending  Truly an amazing video, and the best video to summon me yet
Bro became more smart then me in 14 minutes than I did in my whole life.
Ah, my old enemy: MATH!
1+1=田 🪟
10:56 "You can't just shoot a hole into the surface of Mars"
Looking at this video, I understand that mathematics is power
It was good》》》》》》》
How do you turn, of all things, Maths into a spectacle to watch?
It's like you took a calculator and the matrix, threw them into a blender, put orange right in the middle of it, give it the same insanity and combat action as the rest of his series and Poof! You got this awesome animation! Nice work man!  P.S. This takes quick maths to a whole different level.
Dang the sounds and the animation idk jow this even work anymore
Никогда математика не была НАСТОЛЬКО ЭПИЧНА
Math is my worst subject so seeing this is cathartic XD
yo quiero de lo que fuma este tipo
Math is thrilling yet frightful.
i wish math is thought like this in school . or a video game based on where solving mathimathical problems will give you awesome weapons
I love how creative Alan Becker he can be with anything
OH MY GOD, IT’S *NEW!*
e looks so adorable
6×3=
Pov: you put your calculator under a microscope.
Bro 1+1 is 21 not 11
Bro i love math but i didn't how he is doing that 🗿🙂
Wooow. This was amazing. I've watching this channel for almost 15 years now, thank you so much for being part of my life.
Bro went einstein for a minute💀
Okay, can someone please make an iOS or VR program that lets you manipulate numbers like this? Turning math into a "tactile toy" would be the best way to learn math. Making it more visual so you can see the relations between numbers and how they connect in real time.
The comments were 8 hours ago when this was made 1 hour ago... I think the other stickmen interfered with TCO's math...
Jesus Christ.......
Made in heaven
As a physics major , i can say that this is the fucking best fucking animation of my fucking life.          Still , next has tk he animation vs chemistry
The way tsc becomes like an asian
its funny how the stick figure of alan can turn anything into a fighting simulator xd
I suddenly feel like i want to learn math, i feel like i love it somehow. only Alan's tho
this is how my friend thinks maths should be,  and i say that he's right
Wow
When Orange/Second Coming and e started fighting with "swords" i was instantly reminded of the fight between The Chosen One and the Paper Clip from AVAII. at least i think it was AVAII, might have been AVAI. i understood the beginning of the maths but when it started getting more complex, i'm like "I understand nothing of this but this is EPIC!" Alan, you and your team are awesome! Keep up the great work!
It took me 5 years to master but this figure got it in 18 seconds!!!!
this is actually teaching me math as a 6th grade primary school student
Who would've known maths would be such a creative video idea
Why was I expecting googol plex to appear and flood the screen with zeros.
why was this actually sick as hell
Piękna animacja leprzych w życiu nie widziałem
math has never been so exciting
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The animation is good
This made me traumatized cause of being amazed
JEEZ, this is probably the most hardest math class I've been in lol
This video should be nominated for Oscars.
bravo!
this was glorious
B a w n g s o o s 12 3 4 . . .
everyone know 1+1=11 😂😂
How can a bunch of numbers and symbols, with 1 stickman can be so epic😂
First
('ー')/~~
I was think I smart at math,but after I saw this video now I know that I just a dumb monkey😂
BRO I CANT UNDERSTANDDD ABOUT MATH GOOD AHHHHHHHHH
trying to keep up with all the math was hard
2:55 proof that -0 is a number
Me with a math degree who had to use a lot of this in college
8 + 4 = ?
when I fell asleep in math class
Just wait until Second Coming must fight an entire universe (Type IV Tegmark).
A comment was 8h ago wait but it release a 1h ago how huh?
The fact you made math look so fun and also keep it accurate is absolutely beyond me
what in the
SC's level of intelligence is off the charts, that's some interesting lore
Just Wow this is my favourit episode
that is as terrifying as it is beautiful
This gotta be the best math lesson I've ever had
وقتی خانوادت میگه برو ریاضی کنارش یوتیوبر ماینکرفت هم ادامه بده
An interesting and unique concept executed perfectly, you and your team are both mad men and the greatest artists the world has ever known
Cuando van a ser el segúndo episodio de animator vs animation vi
it's so absurd I love it
POV: 3rd grade me messing with a calculator
Now THIS is how you make education entertaining for students to pay attention so take notes schools especially filipino schools cuz i need my education to be entertaining for my ADHD + ODD brain to actually pay attention so i would stop knocked out sleeping and slowly ruining my life
My man went from simple addition to death ray
You make SOOOO cool and epic fights on your chanel
O k
1 1 empate
I can imagine a Math Teacher getting SEVERAL semesters of topics using this. And he can even make it fun by using exercises to make special moves for Orange to use in the fight. Beautiful.
Epic fight
why you learn us math in holidays.OH and i never have in school that example:1+1=angry e letter and laser beams
here also we didn't find the use of a^2 + b^2 + 2ab thing lol 🙃
oh love me some math
Masterpiece.
That is what's happening in your calculator
Can’t wait for a mathematician to react to this and break down all this because I only remembered the basics and what radius ment
i cant belive that alan becker is a human being this is too intense for a human being
H a y
Wait
If this IRL i will be in love with math sessions
Amazing I hope there will be a part 2
All math program of school, college and university in one video
Bro became mathematician/wizard/coder
Awesome
we need another music episode
If math was like this i would for sure love math
Math is beautiful and Strong .... And now.... It's a weapon of Science.... A brain.
How to teach unteachable 1st graders:
1+1=11 idiots
Oooo
holy shit nine thousand six hundred and eighty three comments already? ive commented here 1 hours ago!
Partie 2
YES
The biggest plot twist in all of mathematics
Math is beautiful and Strong .... And now.... It's a weapon of Science.... A brain.
You could’ve made Pi as something to heal with! (Great video nonetheless)
Profesores de matemáticas explicando para que sirven las matemáticas
Since when math is a wearpon
He is gonna be The best math teacher ever
I love how orange is like a curious child, experimenting with math
What's 9+10?
when i wacth this, my brain now + 20% of smart🗿
I have an idea, what if Animation vs Terraria? It would be cool too since they're compatible to the 2D layout of the game. Btw this animation is absolutely amazing, I love math really much and this animation makes me realize that if we are creative, it will help us understand more about it.
Wow xem xong rối loạn não thực sự 🤯
awesome
orange hit him hard for the bois
Imaggine i just wated this i few hours untill i watched this
I always question why tsc is so smart.
ZELLEN TIENE QUE VER ESTO!!  And incredible work Alan, all detail its just amazing <3
aknlan bocker
9:25  the orange ( I forgot the name) Take the ∞
I never thought math could be cool but alan mad it awsome
ooooh
Damn I just learned math in under a day thanks to a stickman damn I bet that we can start a Lore from this and calculate to where he spawned
So... This is the best one so far XD I absolutly adore it !
Homie accidentally fell in the calculator
WOW i like this, special for that e become friend with The Second Coming
1+1=11.09.2001
i was expecting something else but thats good
this is far-beyond something. Alan Becker is a god.
College math be like
its super vidio
This is the first time in my life where math is interesting
0:35 i know what you are thinking about his hand
My brain hurt
5:34 he can draw a perfect circle but we cant?
i love how at the start it was just 1+1 = 2 but not even 7 minutes in and its already too complicated for me
1+10=11
This is the most interesting math video I've ever seen. Great work from Alan, as usual
Its only possible for Alan Becker to make math actually looks interesting
This video show how math is most powerful forces in the world...
Bro made friends with a mathematical constant 🗿
me trying to get a passing grade:
1+1=2
That so epic
What the heck goes on on our Calculator apps?
When teacher said "Math Is Fun"... Thats what they mean
Animation vs Breaking Bad
Привет Алан мне всего 10 и я боюсь что в старшых классах будет сложно но если бы математика була такой то я с радостью учился бы на хорошо спасибо за то что делаешь токие ролики если не понятно переведи Пожалуйста;)
I hope a mathematician goes through this video to verify all the concepts in it, because I do not know enough about this. And I need to know if this is accurate.
You made the most hated subject into the most coolest combat fight scenes animation... like bro how much did it take from you to calculate all of this 😂
going to be very honest, this was an impeccable test for recognizing and thinking through each equation and statement being made here. these sticks learn quick since he starter with only figuring out addition, and moving up to higher dimensional calculations and complex translations through composition.  I'm worried what yellow would be able to do if they got here...
Cái kết có vẻ vui nhưng tôi thấy nó có vẻ buồn , những phép toán ở trong thế giới quá nhàn chán .
This gotta take over the school system
this is really interesting for it being math
The sounds so satisfying
They should use this to teach math at schools I would be a pro at math
w h a t
Bro this is fricking awesome as HELL, you are the best at animating
We all know 6 does not equal 6/0 (what he said is “6 = 6/0” while it means 6 = 6/1
very fun!
How teachers think we will use math in our lives after school
There's lots of peaple don't understand joke💀
hey alan when will you upload animator vs animations season 2 episode 2
Where do u find me this calculator
Thoughts on Mathematics be like:
Teacher : Omg you so good at math how you lean that so fast?  Me : Stickman
beynim yandı
1+1=창문
Im sorry but did he just make a whole death star out of math??
According to this, all you need to become the flash is to consume multiplication signs?
00:01:41 no, don't go to that field of math, with graphs and stuff
Hurt my brain but really enjoyed it lol
It's master piece
Film+math=Epic
İf earth is made from math be like:
i should have studied more math to understand this video
If maths was this fun to explore Everyone will be a mathematician
If there's one thing I've learned from this video, it's that math escalates quickly.
1:40 comecei a não entender nada ai
I'm too dumb to understand math
Part 2 please
For once we have to rely on someone other than Matpat to explain the lore of this video, someone get a mathematician on the phone so they can give us the juicy insight
i don't understand a single thing but it's still entertaining
This guy can make math entertaining
I don't even know what and double imagine that congratulations Alan the animation was amazing and I loved the fight very good congratulations
bro's got no more content besides math
This makes me want to become a mathematician so I can understand how any of this works.
It's so cool
Wow! So many math in the video. I don't know all of them, I only know some of them. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Pi, Square Root, Fraction, Common Core Math, Point, Percentage, Formula, Brackets and Infinity. That's all I know.
Please do Animation vs Geography if you can
الموقف الذي كان منطقة نور الدين الإسلامي في الولايات الأمريكية😂الكويكب رقم قياسي😅
why is the letter "A" was in the end walking (a means א in  hebrew)
Hallo
Wow, how can you keep getting better?!
Imagine people learning better about math when watching this rather than listening to the math teacher tho
how tf did this teach me more maths than my teacher ever did?
This is so good, I even commented on my semi-secret channel just to make this corny comment. So feel free to feel free. This is an epic episode in your lore and your project(s).
1+1=1+1
11:09a King  reference?
Bro  I got confused just of the numbers
Stay in school kids
eiTt

Genius
That was cool and Alan Becker is super smart
the animation is so good, the music also just fit so perfectly
I knew.. some
TSC: Oh yeah. It's big brain time.
Sorry I missed the premiere. I'll watch this when I have the time.
The + end =  ∞
The animation is impressive but...Guys, my head's hurt.
just reminding it all started with just "1"
It's coolest thing i have ever seen
wow. I'm genuinely amazed
damn math being interesting thats rare
Sounds of "math" are so satisfying in this video, Alan, Great work!🤤
That was the like GREATEST THING EVER these never fail to impress me these are like full blown movie shorts👍💗💗❤️❤️
Bro did math lore in under 20 minutes.   DASSSS CRAZYYY
add this to math interest, now it's in with Evagalion Math lore and Vsauce
I love maths, I love animation, this was the best combination  :DD
Me on the last day of school getting rid of all my school work
Thanks for learning maths 😅😅
I have no idea what just happened
it's really cool, I salute and admire, even though I don't really understand the calculations. but still really cool bro 😁😁👍🏻👍🏻👏👏😇😇👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
When he did math fun: EVERYONE LOVES MATH
Alan, surely you can create a second physics, you will make heavy things fly
Why did this video become so deep. Like I really felt for the orange guy at the end. Like. Bruh maybe maths isn't a waist of your life.
Is this 10std
You can consider me crazy, but now i fucking love math
Forget school I can learn math here
Why in the and I saw "א"
1+1= window
As a math guy that was extremely entertaining
Epic
You do a war of gods using only math
10/10 definitely recommend to what this video
The attention to detail in this video is immaculate, well done alan 👏
Hi Alan Becker A.K.A The legend of animating
Answer in thumbnail is.....               Get trolled
Best one ever ,it like a movie 😂😊
Я просто все больше и больше поражаюсь гениальности этого канала! Мало того что качественная анимация, так еще и поднимается довольно нелегкая тема математики, это сочетание просто поразило меня, очень круто!
7:35 e turns Sigma
and if that's how math was explained at school, it would be very cool
Bro just taught us more about math in 14 minutes than we have in our whole lives-
Finally someone knows my internal pain.
my brain after this video 💀💀💀💀
Math become a weapon
not gonna lie all of your hard work of this is worth it.
1+7=9
dame i need more of this
MATH BECAME MY FAVOURITE SUBJECT
This is Albert Einstein's Brain
1 sword 2 bow 4 ammo
Вот так учить математику я бы не отказалась 😮😮❤❤
I want to have another
what are the ones that came at the end
Part 2 please
The smartest stickman ever👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
It begs the question, HOW DID THE SECOND COMING EVEN GET IN THERE?
The + End = The End
Was that the א character (first Hebrew letter) in the end?? Animation vs Languages  foreshadowing??
Yes
I'm so confused😅😅😅
Bruh
im not sure what just happened. but i liked it
I thought someone was going to do 0/0
that goddamn "i" gave me a heart attack
this is best video ever i'm glad you made this video❤❤❤🔮🔮🔮🎆🎆🎆🥳🥳🥳🤗🤗🤗🥺🥺🥺🥺🤓🤓🤓🥳🥳🥳👍👍👍🫶🫶🫶👍👍👍🫶🫶🫶🥴🥴🥴🤭🤭🤭🫢🫢🫢😚😚😚😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘THANK YOU TO MADE THIS VIDEO I LOVE YOU TO

damn now I finally know the benefit of sin, cos and tan
I sence a 20 part series incoming
whats the point of this crap ... can't find a story yet !!
수포자라서 4:30 까지만 이해되네
2+2 is 4 - 1 that’s 3 quick math
He has a big brain
IMPRESIONANTE!!! No se mucho de mates pero hay que tener mucha cabeza para esto. Un aplauso por este trabajo porque a sido increible.
Olha esse laranja vagabundo fazendo matemáticas😂😂😂
I wish I was smart enough to know how cohesive the math is.
Can't wait for animation vs Musical Notation
I'm definitely using this for my college math classes😂 (awesome video btw)
I’m not originally English speaker so I can’t say some English name of formulas… But, as a math-lover, I want to say that this videos is incredible ‘cause there’re differential, integral and complex plane in the battle with Euler's formula!!  it's a little educational (‘cause there’s not so explanation of some of them) and very interesting for math learners!!
Math nerd pov:
when math gets interesting.
If u have an Alexa ask her what's 1+1 she'll say "2 but I think u already know that" lol
Now i know why characters in Adventure Time use "Mathemathical" to describe something cool.
Why don't you upload videos bro 😢
После этой анимации Я уже боюсь учить Математику
Emang matematika boleh sekeren ini?
If my calculator was like this I wouldn’t mind it taking a bit before the results were finished
So far, this is the best action movie in 2023!
this is awsome althought idk anything about math 💀
Nah that's too op 9:31 , the dev should nerf that
e
im feeling dumb

Only real ones know 1+1= Window
"Easy math really" -*Mumbo Jumbo*
I haven't even studied the level of math shown in this video yet like the imaginary numbers and all, all I know is that TSC fired a tangent wave so big that it broke imaginary numbers
Teachers
Amazing animation! Could u make animation vs terraria?
And that is how you truly do mathematics.
ここ最近見た動画の中で1番面白い
Ayo anyone here knows what's 9+10?
how math teachers expect us to use math in the outside world
10 +10 = 20 11 + 11 = 20
1+1 is a mysterious question
I’m waiting your vidios sooooo long
Took me a second watch to realize a few things. 1. When e leaves, it’s them going to the other side of the graph. So the -1, -1 side or the +1, -1 side.  2. The r stood for radius. As in the radius of the circle.  And 3. I’ll never know half of this because I’m dumb but I ASSUME the sin cos is how you get “eipi”
This is so trippy and how shcool works just continue no explanation
"So class, what did we learn today?" "Pi is the ultimate building block for weapons against e^iπ but can cause the destruction of all maths."
Everyone know 1+1+1+1= 1m
This is my history with math in a a nutshell. I loved it but then it started attacking me
This is probably the coolest math will ever be
Are these connect to AVA S2?
Did Squidward start the Russian Revolution? When the great chum famine of 1910 and outrageous working conditions struck the Bikini Bottom. It turned the Bikini Bottom into a hotbed for Marxism. These pressing matters were largely ignored by King Neptune. King Neptune told his subjects to eat barnacles which turned the largely peaceful protests of his reign. Into all our riots this violent revolution was egged on by local communist Squidward Tentacles. He encouraged pie bombing of the bourgeois to seize the means of production. Mr. Krabs pleaded with the German Empire to get involved. The German Empire swiftly sent U boats from the Marshall Islands to put down this revolt. Squidward was taken prisoner by the Germans and was later sent to Russia along with Vladimir Lenin during WWI with the hopes he would destabilize the provisional Russian government. (new lore)
My brain during a math Quiz be like:
This is probably the only time someone is going to make me interested in a video about math 💀
Part 2?
why just why. its summer
This is so good
If before I saw mathematics super interesting, watching this video makes me 😱
Still didnt understand the last part
ALAN DID YOU JUST MAKE MATH COOL!?!?!?
I hate math:)
History of math be like
Wish my math lessons can be like this
TSC literally learned my 12 year math lessons in 10 minute
As soon as I leave school they upload this... Really?
조회수는 폭발한다😂
I wonder how much the battle with the second coming will be so epic against baldy?
9.1k comments in 1 hour WOW also great video alan
Yeesh man, that was insane. Then again the best animator on YouTube has insane skills. Also the giant at the end of the video was probably X.
In the mind of a mathematician.
Never has math been so cinematic.
Suspeito que esse video e para . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  🤓Nerdola🤓
Hello
a xd
This animation made me discover a big part of Math, realizing i have only studied a small portion of knowledge of the numberous subject. Thanks Alan and the team for this masterpiece.
9.1 comments in 1 hour WOW also great video alan
THATS COOOOOOL
Mom:stop watching YouTube go touch the gra-  Me:im learning math mommy :)
Весь курс математики за 11 классов в одном видео на 14 минут + боевик в подарок
Super cool ngl
nice vids!
I PASSED MY TEST CAUSE OF YOUU
Way better than ANYTHING i have seen just WOW
alan prob used a calculator while making this vid
Orange guy becomes the smartest stick figure in animation history
Bro just learnt more math in a few minutes than me in 10+ years
POV That one final boss in the game :
Es increíble como puso en plena batalla lo que son operaciones el arco que era un 2 x 2 y lanzaba 4 los láser que derivaba en fin, un genio
Holy hell, this is epic!
You could say that was very...complex :D
awsome
😅😅
Alan’s math teacher should be proud of him and his animations
Oh its an asian parody
If they taught math to me in school like this, maybe I would actually like it and want to learn it
nah i remember first time using phone calc and just do random thing and accidentally found a new number and  new thing, if the calc is like this maybe i can found a fun thing to do or make a new creation
I thought 1+1 is 11😮
1+1=2 😂
Truly tragic that there wasnt a 9+10=21 joke in there
This is getting shown in math classrooms for *years* to come.
bro learnt math in 10 minutes and made a super death star
9+10= ???
stickman is our math teacher
Math, not even once
This is literally me trying to understand maths
can u make an animation vs vr
Meth
Accurate representation of how monstrous and also how beautiful math can be lol.
This type of fight i used to imagine in my mind during my math class XD
It’s a beautiful cinematic masterpiece, everything about is perfect, it even included a moment where e said *it’s e-ing time* and then e-s all over the orange stickman, it’s really one of the *e* of all time, as an *e,* I can confirm that this is truly one of the most wholesome *e* moments of all time. ✊
2 + 2 = 5
1+1=11 😂😂😂😂
I swear schools are gonna show this video
Mis lemont + sticmeni
1
Internet exploder vs firefox😂
TSC is like a little kid who is fascinated by math until he reaches the harder sums.
WAKE UP EVERYONE. ALAN BECKER POSTED.
omgg its a perfect...
If math was fun:
that is movie
Matematik hocası hocam matematikte nasıl bukadar iyi siniz
I was literally sleeping when this happened 😢
So… How did SC get there in the first place?
magnificent bro
quanto e 1+1
this is how the matrix was created
that was so interesting like you learnt maths so good that I think that it might help me in the future and it looked so good that even enemies need to work together and I'm proud to be your subscriber like this series is so good that it has maths and you used maths stuff as weapons and advantage things imagine having the ability to control math itself.
Omg that scream 😂
the music tho
"Ah damn it my math homework turned into a deathray again"
Never thought that math would come to alan beckers videos
i like math now
I feel like I'm in school
Bro what game is tetris is this
I want my calculator to be like this
Animation vs Ben 10
Bro creo que eres el inteligente de la clase XD
You just made math cool again🔥🔥🔥
Alan 2020-2021:animation vs animator Alan 2022:animation vs minecraft Alan 2023:animation vs math Alan 2024:animation vs games
why did he put a letter of the Hebrew alphabet at the end? just stick an א i guess?
bro gave me 69420 goosebumps in 0.0000000000001 nanosecond 💀
Math. everyone's truest enemy.
I liked they video but after two minutes I did not understatd anything
we all need TSC to be in our math notebooks 😂 too entertaining
YESSSS IM EARLY!!!
man i forgot he's asian
Why we are not doing THIS at maths😅
That’s so cool man, how do you do that?
How? How did you make math into a fun fighting animation?
Math is my favorite subject, this makes it more fun!
avm2 when
this Genuinely feels like math interstellar
The sad part is that I know what these are, but I forgot how to do them
This is the TSC backstory we've all been waiting for. No wonder he's so powerful when he's one of the fundamental concepts of mathematics!
And is posible one animation vs pizza tower?
Bro the end is so sad😂😂😭😭😭
Jokes aside the mathematic studies and investigations Alan made are incredible if we consider that It was just for a vídeo, an awesome video
perfect
Math teacher : A++++++++
nah bro made a good job on math
4:40  TSC really went "THE POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!"
Alan's animations are the best. Now he is AniMathor.
Orange IQ now is 5k orange really smart now
Man I missed this content from you
Transformers
bro is discovering! 🧐
I was impressed by how he used mathematics to create an epic fight
First of all, that's really cool Second of all, dude casually built a Death Star
Alan Becker has achieved something my maths professor couldn't.
Wow! Not only is he great at animation,  but he’s a math wizard as well!!
wow
1 = 1
Wonderful animation! And the fact that you can learn/teach main mathematical features makes it even better!
1+1 2
Həll naw this man DOESN'T know that 1+1=5
Man could make a video about how cement dries and I'd be invested.
This is how legends learn math
This is the best math I’ve ever mathed
i had the highest class average in my math class back in high school, i studied hard and paid attention so i could keep up good grades.  Your animation is a monolith of reality colliding with the endless possibilities of media and entertainment content.  thanks for uploading!
mano
Hihi
1+1 is 100% window
Best fight scene+keeps you entertained+would make me interested in art
So confused 😂😂
7:35 oh crap now I'm extremely scared
I don't understand a single thing about this and i love it
This is an amazing surprise to wake up to on my birthday! Amazing as ever!
This is definitely one of the more tranquil animations I have seen. It's almost nice to watch Orange learn with the music in the background.
1+1=11
Bro just invented 4d
благодаря этому видео я наконец поняла, что такое число "пи"
He is entertaining and learning us
"What in the mathic magic kind of math sorcery is this" -me, 2016
I didn't understand the context and why did they fight
I wish I could do this in math it will make it less boring.
Bro is doing meth 9:48
The coolest thing I've ever seen
ULTIMATE FUNCTION RAY GUN YEAHHH
I need more of this Becker
I love maths now
Could be the best thing
me trying to pass the course. it's a real struggle and this man demonstrates it with an animation.
Asian stereotype inspiration XD
I wish I can contribute more to this than a like and a comment, this is incredible
That was great. Don’t know why, but I really like the giant Aleph at the end
That's amazing!!! even i don't undersend that's math ward mean but it's a great video to match math and anime i love it!!
This was a nice video about math and made it more fun, I think the teachers should do this
thanks Alan! Now I understand algebra better :)
i want a mathmatics professor to react to this
Every Nerds Says 1+1=2
I liked seeing how far my math knowledge went before I couldn't understand what was being used
New animation for Alan becker
всё начинается с малого
emotional.

WE NEED A PART TWO
0:32 pov: you are bored in math class with a calculator in hand
The one time math is actually fun
This is so sick! He made math like a fighting
alan would be a legendary math teacher. imagine if he made this as an interactive math class, too.
yooo I got here before a million views :0
The Avengers been real quiet since this dropped
Sad orange
this feels like something you'd watch in high school and have no idea what it means but the teacher proudly presents it as if you just learned everything in the video instantly
Never knew math could be so intense.
10:30 I name that attack "SinusoiBlast"
Dad i need help with my math homework, dad, dad??? Where are u? 😮
2+2=22 1+1=🐟
Everyone Knows 1+1=2
I got so lost really fast... I can definitely say the animation makes it really entertaining though :D Canon or not, its really good :O (I just finished now)
Damn even a math nerd is surprised          (Me)
1+1 = 4
how much time did this take
Here before this video gets popular:
We all know that 1+1=1+1 ez
Math is cool already, don't get me wrong, but you're gonna open the door to a lot more believers with this one.
Me: … yeah :/ we are too naive.
数学って面白いね
Oh. My. God.
HMMMMM
1+1=⚽🧔🇦🇷
I learned how to create a blackhole with kitchen ingredients with this tutorial. 10/10 very useful
When Alan Becker uploads, my day gets instantly better!!!
That is impressive.
I LOVE MATH❤ WOW GOOD IS VIDEO
This just changed the ENTIRE lore of the animation stick figures for me!!!
Finally I can learn math 1+1=8
Hi Alan, I really like your videos and I don't know how you make so many videos in such a short time and I hope you're well and I'm sorry if there's any misspelling I don't know much English and hit your videos 😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Just alan becker being creative unlike the "under animations" totally not pointing any fingers
I already know this is going viral
Alan is a pure genius, he made fights eith math and that mechanics of math.I reallywant to see second part with other stickmans and  potential that math  have
yeah man awesoe vid!
Mitochondria is power house of cell, I do also know trigonometry
math+drugs+epic animation= this EPIC video
Playing with a calculatot
Alan did the impossible he made math interesting.
Alan Becker finally found the purpose of learning maths, to create math battles!
A nerds favorite video
Therapist: Our dreams have meanings.  Math teacher's dreams:
Pov: My brain in math lesson
Is that a math?
Amazing
0:00
What happened to the calculator app....
Omg early
are all those correct?
MAKE THIS AN ACTUAL SERIES PLSSS
War math
I’m sure all the math checks out…. I’m just not gonna be the one to make sure
Alan Becker es el único capaz de hacer una animación de matemáticas y que me interese😊
I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS!? Why as TSC here in the first place, who put him there, why did “e” have it out for him tbw?? Were they just afraid of TSC and unsure of what they were? I thought this would align with the AvA 6 shorts but is straight up just a 14 minute masterpiece explaining math using a fierce battle with TSC agains e
Dude, from the old animator vs animation to this... oml it brings tears to my eyes to see how far it's gone 🥲 keep it up Alan you've been an inspiration.
school is being able to follow this video further every year until you reach the end and still understand everything
What a shot 11:05
School math: ☝️🤓 Stickman math: 🗿🍷
Math
Mathematics is beautiful !
good
Next: Animation vs Meth
I think there will be more subjects
hi
maybe next animation is "Animation vs Physics" xD
This guy man daam good literally damm good 🙌🏻✨✨✨
1+1=3
I like to imagine Alan taking the time to go to College and learn complicated math equations just for this to be his homework
If nerds could fight with math
Bro made math entertaining
No 1+1 is 2
This was beautiful
Teacher: math isnt scary  Math:
Amazing another master piece
Hahaha, Animation vs math, cant be funnier
1+1 =10
Amazing.
This is focing portal.
Porface nice1+1=11 2+1=21 3+1=31 4+1=41 5+1=51 6+1=61 7+1=71 8+1=81 9+1=91 100+1=101 :》♡
Yeah, this sums up my experience with math. I'm told I'm good at it, but I don't understand more than half of it, and I like less than half of it, more than I should.
GG gila nih
very good
I don’t know how but Alan made math so cool,I think this deserves to be a movie.
Learn with Animation!
Вот и пригодилось высшее образование.
Just "wow" ... One like isnt enough to appreciate this masterpiece :D
I never got so excited about math until this video came out
he can turn math into a frickin pvp
Everyone knows 10+9 is 21
Orange is the goat
The + end = sadness 💔
The time when he send back Second Coming remind me of Chosen One enter Alan computer to ruin Dark lord plan
2+2= fish
13:14 bro just created the infinite dimension O-O
Math + Alan = brain hurty
My math final be like
this is so funny but also educational thank you alan ❤
Dang the second coming is really smart he's even smarter than me I don't even know those stuff and this video is intense and I like that keep up the great work Alan Becker!
Bro just gave me an A+ in math 💀
Dudeee 👀👌
So thats what would have happened if I went to school...
What happened to e ?
:0?
Next time in animator vs animation... TSC wake up with math stuff and can now fire wave death laser, like who even need the green eye laser and those power when you have math
Cool ok all episodes cool pvp with your videos
I have never found math this interesting before.
That was so awesome. I don’t know that much math but that was awesome.
Me at 2023 watching this video:🧠☠️ Me at 2045 watching this video:🧑‍💻🧑‍🎓
Это самый лучший фантастический боевик за всю мою жизнь!
h8
If math was taught like this, our people would already have become a type III civilization
animathion
18/10
Alan Becker making these animations is the g.o.a.t
Official
Everyone knows they gonna know that 2+2 is 21
Noooooo maths😰
Who's Smarter Answer My Riddles  Riddles: What's 7y + 2/6  x + XY  Find The x of 12843+  Answer:
according to my calculations 1+1 is not 2 it’s 9
wow, good video
1+1=111
Pleas make more that was amazing alan
man im geting stupid again
This is the best episode yet ive ever seen and the animation's sooo hurts beautiful Good Job👍
POV ur last brain cell which is fun and colorful vs you on your math exam be like:  The ending is when ur free from ur exam but then until brain damage hits back and u realize u also failed the exam
Great animation! Now turn this into a video game.
Me playing with a calculator be like
new seriess les gooooooooooo
Thats the best fever dream ive ever had
Is 2
3 minutes into the video and there are already square roots
Alan I love like I love it here is a heart for making it ❤️
Ok i need lil formula creatures in my textbooks to help me study or just play with, either way I'd be learning mathematics. They're kinda cute too
I like the way it's only the second coming instead of the the rest of these stickfigures
probably one of the best alan becker animations
the+end=endthe
That was beautiful
1+1 is 2 but Alan becker+animation is ✨perfection ✨
Everyone know the answer of any math question is 42 and Jesus
It was the hardest and most complicated thing I've ever seen in my life. I love it.
this is stupid what next Animation vs. YT Short
4
Everyone knows 1+1 is NOT 11!!
This looks like it out of a movie
why does a E had to fight you The Second Coming
How did this video turn my braincells smart... Right now, I know that 1 + 1 is not 11 but it's actually 2...🤯
Yes I did do my math homework
What
Everyone is talking about how great Alan is but did he just kill Orange or am I missing something
wtf
good
0:34 did sc do the sus thing on zero? I probably had a dirty mind or Im just sus
Dude orange he know how to gun shoot him
this went to so many places and i was expecting none of them
imma show this to my kids if i ever have any
Math lore:
waaaaaaaaaaw
This video will make you love maths immidiatly
My brain goes AAGGGHHH!! He's combine math with battle animation that's cool
Pov:me when I get bored and took out my calculator and starts doing random shits in my calculator 😂😂
What a cinematic masterpiece this was. One thing i would have loved see that orange attacking "e^x" with multiple differentials and integrals, and "e^x" would just coldly stand there. Unfazed.
OMG THIS PERFECT AMNIMATION U THE BEST @ALANBECKER
Is it me or is he in a calculator
Get matpat here to explain how orange even did this bro used math methods never used before he even used a freaking shot gun and he made it out of math
this video is occasionally teaching us math without us knowing it
The only man who makes maths cool. But Fr that was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen
Olhando assim matemática até parece uma coisa interessante
NEVER KNEW MATH THIS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
COOL 😎😎😎
now I need someone to explain what is going on at the last half of the video
Nobody: me in math class with my calculator doing literally anything other than work:
Epic
Bro i dont understand 😭
Make more pls
I don´t understand anything beyond 6²
🤯
Who put bro in a calculator
This helped me understand so much more
Truely an interesting class
Alan Becker: *Makes Episode* Pythagoras, Fermat, etc: 😨😨😱😱
This is cool,the sound of the math is sick
Damm big brain
As a Mathematical person who got A+ i actually like this video so much
Oh god, I've been rewatching this for numerous time and yet it still amazes me! Keep up the good work, Alan and team! Keep up the good work!!!
Do not underestimate the power of Math
I like how you represented aleph numbers at the end, as hard to see or comprehend but noticeably bigger than the standard representation of infinity and linked to all real numbers. I only know about aleph numbers from an old Vsauce video about counting past infinity, but it was nice to understand a reference after the high-level zaniness of the climax.
i need more math lore..
Now wait until they found googolplex
cool vedio
If only only I was taught math like this...
The best
U lost me at 1:44
Only alan Becker knows how to make kids who hate math turn to kids that love math this is truly a work of art
I take back what is said
I am so confused right now... Actually as always, when it comes to math...
Alan and his team Made this masterpiece and the sound effects are FANTASTIC He Will Probably reach 30Mill in a few more Months
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 10/10😊👍
this explained math better than my school
I have never seen such a beautiful math video before
Man i only understood 10% of this
Please make Animation vs. Little Alchemy! It would be sick!
itd be cool to see other subjects such as english (or other languages too?), history/geography and science in something like this too
I wish this is how i learned math
Alan You are so creative that even I who live in Korea have become your fan. In particular, this video had a greater impact than the previous videos.  I really want to come up with an idea like you later. You are my role model!😀
Animator vs animator lV ❤😅
he's beginning to believe :D
Im literally learning math while watching this video
This just proves my point on why I hate math
Hi im back remember me
Beautiful math ring ❤
Is 1+1=is2
この動画が中学、高校時代にあったなら数学を嫌いになることはなかったんじゃないかと思います...!ホントにすごい作品です！ (ここに登場した数式は習わなかったし、習っていたとしても覚えていないけれど)
My son he's favorite subject is math and science
Now i can't say 1 is just a number because 1 start all of these
Watch some teacher actually try to use this in class, thinking itll be a comparison between animation and math
Alan Becker in the math exam be like:
Yes, I still have to study and study to this level of mathematics... In six years, I think I'll watch this video again to understand what's going on here at all(...
desmos graphing calculator
Star Wars mp.4
10:9 WHAT IS THAT THING
Bro teach me more then school
1×1=?  Me:21._.
oh my head..
that was amazing
Alan is wondering who broke his calculator
Mathematics could only be done with so much fun and action. It was the best 14 minutes of my life.
Im confused
Why math 😭 it's terrifying
Alan plz make a series out of this.
HOW DID TSC DRAW A PERFECT CIRCLE
how ?? how you got this idea ? it's so awesome
I think you going to hired to be math teacher on youtuber
Alen has become a nerd🤓
this is the only math related thing i will be watching during summer break
Why was this the coolest thing I've ever seen?? This has no reason to be as good as it was. Can someone explain to me what all those equations at the end were?
Ok which math prodigy is going to react to this so we all understand what just happened
すごいとしか言いようがない
"Omg I found a way to count my sheep faster"                                            -A random sheep hearder who is completly unaware on how his discovery would change humanity as we know it
he really took "power of Maths" into a different level
this is actually incredible, it's really satisfying, and all the maths is really well illustrated here
Is tsc fighting  (one) of the hardest subject
At least i got to try it to teleport at least once!
Great! Now do Animation Vs Physics
1+1=window
It's an amazing quality this time too!Very good as a Korean viewer!The translation might be weird because I use a 👍🏻 translator..I'm writing a long comment like this.I'll look forward to it next time, too!
me exploto la cabeza
This man taught me more the my math teacher
- MOOOOOM - what ?  - im ready for the math test !!!
this is the only video about math that i didnt get bored during
i already know how math has its uses, but i like to think alan may of convinced non mathematicians to invest in making it useful
4 million views in 1/2 day, Hats off dude
I feel like this is just a way of Alan flexing how good at Math he is
As a mathematician, I can confirm that all the calculations in this video are true.
that was just a dream
I never wanted calculator in my life this much and im an Asian
How did he know that my math exams ganna come?
That was incredible, I have no idea what most of that meant.
10:35 "that's no math, it's a space station"
To be content plis😢
1111 +1111 =11111111 😎
If used a variable he could have aimed it long distance
Watch this after doing/searching math problem for extra credit        None care
I hate math but this type is REALLY COOL!!!!
1+1=2
8:33 my voy orange make a gun
This video taught me more math than middle school geometry and algebra ever did......
So meny things you can do with math. This was great! 😀😃🙂
This video has taught me more math than my teacher. This is unexplainably great. Also, for the amount of likes this video gets, the amount of votes for an “e” shirt  Edit: In the “multiple e” fighting scene, you can see a 0 appear, and then fade out where an e gets killed. I think this symbolizes the e being reduced to 0. 0 is the ideogram, or concept on nothing, anyway.
*I H A V E L E A R N E D E V E R Y T H I N G*
had no idea math is this fun
Math is more complex than you thought
One days it going to be Animation vs. Quantum physics
So cool
This is the definition of Learn Fun Math!
Every one knows ~~  1+1=11   IT IS VEY EASY 😅
In my school 1+1 is 10😭 and 1-0 is 1 like- my brain hurtttt
Best 14 minutes of my life.
Ngl I thought I wouldn't be interested with Animation vs Math, but you broke my expectations again!!! This concept of being in the middle of nowhere is such a cold atmosphere, and slowly gaining new abilities from discovery brings this whole thing to life!!!  Whether you knew the math or not, slowly seeing Orange build his way out of a hopeless unknown situation with our eyes glued to the conclusions and story, is just SO FLIPPING INTERESTING!!!!
계산기속에서의 싸움은 계속 진행된다.
I guess it's true what they say. Math really can be used as a weapon.
77+33 = 100
Just Amazing!
The math nerd in me is absolutely elated after watching that. That was just way too amazing
Alan proves to us that someone who makes animations always works on the creativity and passion first before moving on to the actual animation which is truly incredible.
fuck math yeaa
10+10=11+11, 10+10=20, 11+11=20 too
Oddly enough, I really enjoyed that ( I had no clue what was going on )
10:02 why so cute :3
What I like about this is that, as far as I can discern, this is all accurate math. I think Alan did a great job and I hope that in a few years, when I'll have finished my studies, all of the equations will make sense to my eyes.
10:02 that battle cry was just so perfectly timed xD
It’s terrifying to see Orange grow smarter in 14 minutes than I have in six years
Never did it occur to me that’d I witness someone PHYSICALLY fight math😂💀
NOT ANOTHER SERIES. IM STILL CRYING FROM THE LAST AVM EPISODE.
With all the math stuff involved, I'm surprised TSC didn't acquire interdimensional if not chrono travel powers.   In spite of all that, this short sure puts a lot of superpowered portable weapons in many fictional works to shame. Sorry, BFG-9000, but 9:24 onwards is a beast!
This literally made mathematics fun! If this was a game, I would totally play it!
=O epic amazing :)
VR maths everyone? Math would certainly be more engaging if this exists for us and researchers to use. I can see mathematician duel it out using formulas and starting with only a 1 = 1 for them to fight with
Bro can look at an oreos wrapper and turn into a weapon that could neutralize the whole multiverse💀
Nah The Second Coming got stuck inside a calculator, poor dude
I can not believe that this is math! Why can't math just be 1+1?
i only understood the first 12 seconds 😭😭
ёмаё
Your kids will love math after watching this video ( 10 out of 10 )
this is by far the best animation i've seen, i love the ambience, the details like for example: the numbers explosion is the answer to the equation, the story telling, basically everything! 10/10 would watch again
Ppl who watch this over the end belike: 😵
He made maths look cool 😮
AMAZING ANIMATION. now i gonna see it
I'm gonna send this to my sister lol
the sound effect here so good wtf
that 'exit' thing was genius. but so was the rest of the video, its just that _that_ was all i could understand.
Why is bro in the void
i want to understand this but i cant
That was fantastic!!
Biology vs Animation next😊
너무 어려워
screw college imma watch this and be solving the world's problems
ONE OF THE BEST VIDEOS ...... LOVE IT
Best and most creative concept there is.
Diooooos!!! nunca me divertí viendo tanta matemática!!!
Me watching it, like i know what 1+1 mean's😂😂
The second coming speedruns math
I'm 10 and i see it
EPIC
So who remembers one of the fight of e^iπ is actually old XP pin v.s. the chosen one?
and there are people who say that math is boring
2:48 - 2:56, the infinity literally gave me goosebumps
Damn this math stuff is so cool, if only it were real.
ทำไมเข้าใจยากจัง
now i want to stop and actually see the math theeir doing to try and understand this power
I really, REALLY LOVE MATH ❤❤❤
😯😯😯
alan can make a fight out of anything
im both amazed and confused
수학이 이렇게 웅장한 것이었나.
First
bro, the most creative math teacher ever💀
Como? Como es tan increíble?
This is what trying to learn math feels like.
This hurts my brain in a good way
orange can rais his hand  to answer 10.
Alt title: How to Love Math
Si el video llega a 100k me gusta se lo enviare a mi profe de matemáticas a ver que opina
Ещё никогда математика не была такой интересной! 😮
this is arguably the greatest video i've ever seen
wow thats cool but i don't understand anything and how tsc went to this dark place??
Breaking bad:
i can't believe there wasn't a single 9+10=21 joke
Im kinda confused. Should i like math now or not?
Bro made math look fun
-Bro is just math -No is a war
2:48 better then EVERY action movie
Not gonna lie, this single animation can teach math really really well
wow so cool animation i love these things
8:23 WTF
As a math teacher, i love this
Holy Shit!!
alan what the fuck what an incredible concept and execution
My brain hurts
Do animations vs duolingo
Fool 1+1is 2
Bro the videos so noice
me during math class:
That was so good OML 😭
Orange became smarter withing minutes but we take years for it.
remind me to dual my calculator later
Wait till a mathematician analyses this 💀
Math battle
Thanks to my boy blue impasta for letting me know this came out
lit
Bro literally taught me more than my school
This guy is literally insane man !! Making mathematics into a smooth animation           Edit: I learned some math from watching this lmao
The test isn't hard to understand  The test
This is the greatest animation to introduce basic math! Thank you Alan and to your team! This is wonderful. ❤
Teacher Math Be Like
Animation vs English next?
Cool
You should’ve did 9. Plus 10
I Like a video
1+1=2 you dumb comment!
Alan Becker its so amazing animation
The only time I have ever like any sort of Math is right now
Why do I need to know math? and here is the reason!
It's so exciting
well I'm an hour late
can't wait to watch this when i'm older and understand whatever is going on
Well we had orange with math then next could be black or maybe green with the letters and blue or red with symbols ?
i gotta send this to my math teacher rq😂
"No one can make math entertaining."  Alan:
bro have a XXXL sized brain
if alan was my teacher i will have every single brain cell of einstein
1+1 people: this is real math. The math:
11-1=1💀
Nobody else on this planet can make math as interesting as that
math has never been so scary
Does that mean orange learn math?
if math like this, its calling "math is fun!"
Bro I learned more math than a year in school
You lost me at 0:00, math sure is hard
Pov math teachers fight room
M A T H
What the hack this huge alef is doing here                     א
well I'm an hour late
I have never seen a guy who managed to made math look this cool. Keep up the good work!
this is me when they turned off wi-fi and went into the calculator
Yesssssssss
10:35 pov:deat star
EPIC!
I liked this more than the regular "Animator Vs Animation" series. Very creative and made me realise I've forgotten a lot of maths since my studies.
And that is how you do Math
What's 9+10?
See this is why I don’t like math class, because the teacher could just do this to you, they could kill you in a second
Me perdi muy rapido xd
the most greater villan of all time
Bro could have been a math professor but became a animator instead
orange really went out here and made the deathstar
...flute biscuits, that was awesome.
Oh
It sounds like he is in space😮
floooooooooooooooooww
^^ what i daydream about in math class 🤣
*confused unga bunga*
my opinion is that 1+1 is 11
Good old styled video, Very cool
bro went straight from doing 1+1 all the way to fighting a mathematical symbol that's alive with a calculus sword also can we appreciate that Alan Becker literally went over all of these subjects in maths and compressed them down into 14 minutes as well as also integrating an interesting mechanic or function for each of them
This is incredible. I love it.
Hi guys, can the second coming beat scp verse?
I've learned more about math in this video them I did all my entire life in school
0:48 The reason why elevators don't have the 13th floor
와...그냥 미쳤다.... 수학에 대해선 잘 모르지만 뭔가 엄청난 퀄리티와 스토리가 있다는 건 알겠다 내가 수학에 좀 더 지식이 많았다면 좀 더 잘 이해할수 있었을텐데ㅎㅎ
This is how u know hes asian
Euler is my new favorite character!
pls can the victim come back (from that old animation)
I'm one hour late—dang it. Still great video
I need this guy as my teacher
I learnt more math than I learnt in my entire school life
First time in the history anyone has made maths this interesting. Truly a GOAT
This video can be used as an educational video for children.
🧠
Now I learned a bit of new maths
You know how Baldi says “Math is everyone’s favorite subject”   Those words and this video could change all of that.
8:37 Rush E
Bro made a death star💀
Can't wait to see all the math teachers reacting to this
Teaching math, with Alan and Second Coming
Every kids worst nightmare
what
I absolutely loved this video. I would like to see a Animation vs Demon Slayer video.
can you make a part 2
he is albert coming 2.0
The End But Where Di Tsc Go?
This music is so sciency XD
What 6:24
This is just... amazing.
Bro make math exciting 🗿
正直、馬鹿には難しい動画でしたね😅
I hope my math Teacher can explain the math Formula like this
This is how we should’ve been taught in school. I chuckled at math.
the animation makes me remember my math test
This why math is cool
Once TSC have Math power I bet agent guy can't stand a chance to survive About victim I am not sure But the other that capture TCO can't stand
Is it just me that the e reminds me of alphabet lore
Do people know what kind of soundtrack is in the video?
Bro got stuck in the calculator app 💀
This is what high school/college Math Classes should show on like the first day of school. Not only to wow the students, but to refresh their mind on formulas and stuff after Summer. Godly work!
Wow hei  king orenge vs  math wait win me to math op😅
we did it. we defeat MATH!
All the maths that we learned its all here
Hands Down the first time i actually liked math and found it cool. GOODJOB ALAN
alan made math cool 😳
왜 갑자기 머리가 아프지?
10:02 waaah!!!! 🗣️🗣️🔥🔥💀
i just learned so much math
Hay. I Indonesia
sad that this ended. honestly, this might sound stupid, but I'd watch a whole a** movie about this
God of Mach not god of war GOD OF MACH
*POV: You try to learn math.*
The Second Coming: Exists  Baldi: Finally. A worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
i'm seeing some gnarly orange stick figure fight using equations... i think i've been doing meth instead of math again.
Al an, I I love your creativity but violence does not create a rational story.
so amazing!!!
It feels like I'm learning by just watching, even though I'm not
как проходит урок математики по мнению математички
the maths is power
We’re learning from you Alan. Make More!
That was incredibly well constructed, damn this is a really smart animation and with just as awesome action as always 🤯 Looking forward to maybe seeing a sequel•••? 😁 Regardless, fantastic work from you and your team, great job Alan 😎👌
Mom: stop watching things in the internet it makes you dumber   Me: Watches this math video to learn math better
No  1+1 is window!
You might need to make a video game out of this.
Bro is Albert Einstein
thats the first time i like math bruh
POV: your brain on a math test
My brain isn't braining
I am so severely confused......
Why can't  we do math like this in school?
What happned to the stick figure at 13:23
10:01 He was traing to say: EEEEEEE
the real math movie
Bro is Not 1+1 is a 2 not 11
That was sick please more of those maybe alphabet
I didn't understand the references, but the video was great, one of the best in terms of animation
1+1=50
So did the Second Coming just get teleported back to his home dimension, or he went poof in the Mathematical Dimension?
I’m not even going to lie I thought the stick finger in the thumbnail was a rope indicating you know what
Pls 2 part This is so beautiful 🤩
Our worst enemy
Orange's reaction to Eulers' identity was hilarious XD
@fajrulfx
I’m gonna start seeing my math classes as fight scenes now.
This man and his crew always make an amazing work from literally anything.  I have to give props to the Animation and specially the creativity, and this comes from someone who loves Mathematics and it's areas.  And i love the way the OST works, like it's something mysterious and unknown, and the sounds though, are basically the aounds i imagine if someone said "If Math had sounds"  I'm surprised on how much this man can amaze me with an orange stick-figure and a black background with random white numbers and symbols on the screen.  Love your work, please keep it up! ❤💛💚💙   🧡
1+1+1=1  If you were a Christian
Alan please make Animation vs Physics Physics is my favorite subject
second coming figured out math faster than i can remember how to use a calculator
Battle of Math
i first read it as "Animation Vs. Meth" 💀💀💀💀💀
*ªΩ*
When -1 turned to e^iπ, the video turned to horror movie
I have no idea what equation he’s fighting and I’m scared to learn it but I also love it
This broke my math knowledge.
11:17 o my god! I think he‘s Duolingo Max or else
If math was actually fun:
😆😆😆
1+1 to (x+y)²= x²+2xy+y²
Bro its became a war💀
is that even canon
this is freakin awesome
amazing!! I love it!! well done Alan
No it's window 1+1=🪟 You see?
WHAT?
It's interesting with all of the equation and using the form of maths to create this creativity. I'm wondering if the Y-axis in diagram is showing that they are in imaginary world since the values is using imaginary (i numbers). Therefore, to go back to the real world, the 'i' was removed in the final teleportation. This is great depiction of Math. Love it {(x² + y² -1)³ - x²y³=0}❤
Bro defeated the hardest thing in the universe
Please please PLEASE make more of this, this is absolutely stunning!
Orangetains
and that's how Alan's theorem which suggests that math is fun is proved
which you were my math teacher haha
He does the thing and the e appears again and he tries to catch it
How teachers think we see math
Fuck it's 3😡😡😡
New AvM lol
Love how this is so rewatchable because you can understand the little details in some parts of the video and they're actually mathematically accurate, especially the "imaginary world" bit.
This video made me understand math more than 4 years of high school
Hello alan becker😊
Oh no, he is using his Asian power XD
It's so satisfying to understand Math lore
Epic math fight.I wonder what they will take on next the holidays or outer space or old monster movies
finally someone was able to realize my thoughts. (I am developing a game with such a concept)
Bro became Albert Einstein for 14 mins
これはまるで暗殺教室に登場する問スターのようなキャラクターです
biggest problem in my life
Alan becker litterally became a teacher lol
I hope the second coming kills it because i honestly hate it
surprising.
something devided by 0 is INFINITY, Because if you do 1 devided by 0.000001 (close to zero) you get a huge number so 0 is infinity.
Number Lore
This video proves that math stands for Mental Abuse To Humans,truly a masterpiece.
1+1=17.5
I've never been so entertained watching math
When the two smartest students of class have different answers
I think I'm going to ask my math teacher to put this on the classroom television...
It's amazing!
It's not just me, right? That smiled every time I see each equation.
e having an i got me. euler just left the server.
This is the most mathematical video I've seen
Masterpiece would be:
es que esta muy buenoooooooooo yessssssssssssss
Bro this is to much for me to handle
I'm from india I'm in 11 science thanks to clear my doubt ❤
METH
I would’ve been stuck in that void forever.
Math is really confusing. I didn't know that those symbols exist 😃
Sc using the plus symbol as a cross and is repelling the demon of e
Алгебра, в параллельной вселенной:
Cool a new video
Bro I've never seen a video which better explores the concept of discovering maths for oneself, well done
I don't like math's
Bro tsc became genius
I have learnt more math in this video than from my high school calculus teacher bruh  LOL
Perfect
My man literally didnt say anything and i know what all the calculator stuff works now
NO.  1+1=3
we need a second part
This video made math awesome
B
Orange is fighting some insanely difficult math problem.😂
🎉buen video
Maths just became cool again
The + End!? What the heck does THAT equal!?
Nerd students: Yoooooo I’ve been waiting years for the most greatest movie of all time🤓😂
1 hour ago baby!!!
That’s so cool
Oh yeah it's big brain time.
The first person to discover math
Only a youtuber can make math soo much fun, I love it 😂
I’m just gonna say that this video is a masterpiece and I’m impressed how Alan and his team always manage to produce masterpiece with any kind of theme I loved this video
I wish MY math lessons were like this several years ago
Ooooooh my word this is so good
Everyone knows 1+1=windows.
As an Student, I'm so confused
i gotta see a math breakdown for this
Любой пятикласник выше 2 минуты видео: 💀
this is probably the only time where everybody agree that math looks awesome.
The Second Coming just became a math wiz
oh, what a pity that I'm just a fifth grader from Russia and don't know more than half of what's here (this is a sentence from the translator). The author is a great fellow, all the videos are very cool.
Plot twist: TSC is Alan’s calculator app
this is for smart people...
Oh come on everyone knows whats 1 + 1 its 35  What the math teachers see: 1+1  What students:
I didn't knew that maths is that strong at fighting
2
Words can't describe how awesome this is.              Neither Numbers can.
Alan Becker make anything fun like math
Why is this one of my favourite Alan Becker animations?
I mean 2+2 is 4
Bro, how on Earth do you make these cool sound effects and animations smoother than melted butter? They're awesome!
Un excelente trabajo como siempre por parte de Alan, son tantos conceptos matemáticos que están muy bien logrados lógicamente hablando.  Un saludo desde México 🇲🇽
This is the best video yet
Please part 2 this video is awesome
11:25 this is exactly what it feels like to be introduced to derivatives in calculus class.  It’s like an entire upside down world of math.
i somehow understood and didn't understand all of this.
how the hell did alan make math look fun
nice video
Aint no way hes out here learning all the maths i learnt for yrs in 14 munutes 😂
Took "you need math for life!" To the next level
imagine if orange stickman would use math in future videos
My man learned math before making this video.
8.3k the here
yay i'm 1 hour early yay
dude... that. was. AMAZING! honestly, not only would i love a "long form" video of Orange visiting again and showing Red, Green, Blue and Yellow with Orange explaining it all to them (and us) at a slower pace. but it would be even better to somehow turn this into a game. obviously it cant be as energetic as the fight scene but the idea of having to push, pull, twist, rotate, stretch and squash things to manipulate the basic arithmatic functions + - = like Orange does and progressively build them up with these kinds of intuitive visuals. i can just imagine being given an "antagonist" (or several of varying magnitudes) that "glitch" in occasionally (providing limited, though prompting cues) and your goal as the player is to experiment and navigate the mathematic "world" to build towards things to "catch" them. you have an inventory that is similarly mathematical, where you can freely manipulate that too with math, including its size, so you also have to remember to "make" enough operands and common numbers. obviously there would have to be complexity limits because computers but i still think that that could be a really cool and educational tool as well as quite a lot of fun for puzzle lovers and math nerds alike. you should maybe consider looking into the viability of such a thing with some people. i have no doubt that it would do amazingly, especially if Orange makes regular appearances to help. sort of like a clippy but in math and actually helpful. also, yes, i would totally have a "desktop assistant" thing like that if it were done like this. a hybrid virtual "pet" and genuine utility. im getting side tracked but the point remains that games and other interactive media like them would be amazing :)
I'm in Grade 7 so now that you have shown me this I am very interested in studying these different equations
"knowlage is power"
My brain hurt
9:59  BROOOOOOO when he got to the function of infinity and then there's the limit -> infinity, blows my mind 😮😮 this one is the real sh 🔥🔥🔥
This video is giving Interstellar vibes to me.
와 진짜 미쳤다는 말 밖에는 안 나온다....
TSC is a very fast learner and now he’s a big genius like yellow
my question is how he ended up there
how you do that????
Literally, one of my favourite subject in schools
I hate math because its hard(
Wow part 2 pls with more stickman blue pink green
2+1= 21 yeahhhhhhhhhhh
If Orange wasn't overpowered before... He definitely is now... He conquered Math
u made me love maths
I got huge Pixar's soul vibe from this and I love it
batman4014
2
Yes,yes,yes,yes❤❤❤
1+1 is 2 and 2+2 is 22
Alan is smarter than einstein 💀
1+1=2
Why real math Isn't this good
This is very cool, the animation, the sound effects, it's like math in every grade, starting form addition to some circles things pretty dope👌
finally commented early
is it bad that math is my favorite subject
u should learn math or he will come for u
100 + 100 = 200
For crying out loud its just a stick figure animation so why is it sooooo good man😮😮😮😃😃😊
3:21 = insane
Alan single handedly made math actually entertaining
That was incredible !!!😮
1+1 is 2
TSC in the beginning is like all of us with calculators as children 😂
Math is complex yet fun and Alan and his team has portraited that perfectly
This is so underrated
Aleph number belike
You know the creator is good when they can made fucking MATH epic
nobody: if the calculator was a war game:
You can always count on Alan Becker
As a math fan, what is happening
This is the best one but there should be a sequel where all the stick figures have to battle an army of math
Omg is awesome movie
Now I need a Animation vs. Math Explained please
This feels like a math animation gone wrong.
As a 4 grader, I can approve with everything.
This is the coolest way to learn math
Orange : *sees infinity* In Orange's mind : "New weapon acquired" Orange : heheheheh                 Muahahahaha
Azucar.
Engineering MFS:
Speechless
It’s like a puzzle. I think he’s trying to escape
ORNGE JUST LEARN FASTER
Кто-то:Какая самая не эпичная тема для сюжета?  Кто-то другой: Математика Алан Беккер: я так не думаю
7:47 bro turned into a movie
My head hurt 😵😵
I can feel my brain expand watching this.
After I Watch This Video, Math Is More Complicated Than I Imagine..
Cool
I want him to be my math teacher. :)
・∇・b  buudo
I don't understand this yet i understand this
4:40 where do i saw a scene like this one This animation and my math class have both in common, they are math and I don't understand anything
Finally, Gu En
this is math nerd hevan, i love that all of the math equations are accurate even if you took some creative libarty with how they were arranged, and i especially love the use of the limit of 0 to infinity as a sword though i feel the lack of tan() was a missed opportunity for an easy level up for one of the combatants
do more like this
Best math explaination ever😢😢😢😢😢
Do you know what plot this animation has?
This was so creative! You should defineltely do a part 2!!
We need a part 2 that introduces the z-axis
Hi
Imagine if he did this for his school project, that would be so cool!
Let's be honest everyone, we lost track the moment letters got involved in math.
This sounds like doors music
א ? 13:45
I think this is the best video I've ever seen
1+1 = 2 but that’s ohio that’s means it’s 1+1=11 💀💀💀
Everybody know 0/0=1
A los maestros de la matemática este video kes abra echo gritar mucho🤣🤣🤣
The sound effects are incredible they need to put it in transformers
im surprised you used hebrew
This is how it feels to do your first college math exam
psychologist: dreams matter  my dreams:
How can be 3+5 = 9?        By mistake = (uncle jokes)
what?
easiest way to learn math
Alan Becker, only guy on earth who can make math mesmerizing. I'm only 3 minutes in, but I already love the whole video  Edit: Okay.. wow.. I just finished the video. Using math as a way to fight and evade, an interesting concept executed in the best way possible!
And so the math was created
The Second One it i The Math Void
This was beaultiful
Very good 👍🏻
I stopped knowing what was going on at just 3:50 XD
The video was quite interesting and different from others i liked this one its great!
It was worth watching the video >:D
Orange can to met- math
Very good enough 🎉❤
this the reason all student hate math cause its dangerous >_>
This man and stickfigure singlehandedly reignited my liking from math, this is extremely entertaining
Ну всё теперь ждать когда будут Секонд и жёлтый соревноватся в знаниях
wow, how many naked
Well, the work in this video was probably multiple times 100, huge respect for alan and his team. d:
This is a work of art
We can now say for sure that math is hard to solve
The only word that could describe this is... mesmerizing. Great job with this video!
Ah yes when tsc on drug
So this is how math works, and also this is almost a learning show for kids
This hurts my brain
Bro tsc  became Albert Einstein
For someone who likes math I really like it and there's some I haven't learned yet but imma learn them in 8th grade+
Oh? 1?
imagine ur at 1st grade and get to 12th after this video 🗿🍷
What I’ve learned from this is that sine waves are dangerous.
I don't think I need math anymore
Hey Alan!
Gg
1+1=11
It has become my favorite😂, I literally only learned up to the perfect square trinomial, I already got lost when that e appeared hahaha
I knew it. Math is the biggest villain of all
imma wait for animation vs terraria
와 진짜 천잰가? 난 진짜 이 내용을 극히 일부 밖에 모르지만 확실한건 난 평생 이것들을 이해 못할거 같다
I’ve never been so focused on something math related my entire life.
How did he draw a perfect circle
We need a sequel
This is absolutely genius! I wish I still went to school so that I could show this to my Maths teacher.
보는 동안 입만 벌리고 있었다. 이젠 성장이 아닌 진화라고 여겨질 정도인데?
Thank you for this video,just in time to learn math again for the math exam
3:18 bro has unlocked the 4th dimension
I wish math was like this
This is sick + I didn't know that you know a lot about math.
Imagine how better school would be with this instead of the Miss Johnson yelling on the top of her lungs for the 35th time why we have repeatedly failed to answer her question
HES INSPIRED ME TO START MAKING ANIMATION
The best thing on YouTube rn
WHY ARE THERR LETTERS IN MATH
😵‍💫
great. just great.
This is how I feel in my calculus class rn
I love the part where e^(iπ) reunites with its complex function friends, especially with the looming Aleph
wait, isn't it *Oscar* winning video??
YES 1H AGO! AND YET I THOUGHT IM EARLY,
Who can understand this animation ?
❤
Dude… 1+1=fish
This hurt my head just like math
Brain.exe crashed
Orange must be a genius to learn math so quickly
nice!
Starting concept: stuck in a dimension and you have just a 1+1 Final concept: WHAT THE HELL HAPPEND HERE??????
I love alen Becker
Me Vs My math homework that was due a week ago:
Nice sfx
me doing my exam math:
God, I didn't know you'd fight with a sword in math
if math was a fighter game this would be pretty accurate XD
The best way to make math fun
Math teacher:how would u use math in a real life situation? Me:'shows her/him this vidio
What the fuck bro what are you doing pls epsodie 2
guys i think 77 + 33 is 100
My head hurts
Orange just taught himself math faster than even the smartest high school student
13:45 My favorite math symbol in this video. ℵ. (aleph)
am I a nerd because for some reason I can understand those functions?
Que increible me encanto❤  Me impresiono bastante 😮
Can't believe I understood most of that. Only things I didn't get was the ie doorway, one of the symbols at the end and whatever that massive thing is at the end in the background XD Kinda glad my higher maths still has a use though, even if it is YouTube videos XD
Bro really started with 1+1
Это превосходно, если бы мне так преподавали математику в школе я бы наверняка знал бы всю алгебру
Monke
First time an Alan Becker video breaks my head 😅😅
animation vs science
Alright, now we need math enthusiast to explain the lore of this.
This is incredible.
Wow, it’s amazing!
That's fire
if this was math my brain is gonna explode cuz its to hard to comprehend
1+1=25
?
Whoa the animator vs animation guy
Who said that sin, cos and tan were useless?
Speedrun of math
Finally a video that I liked like your first ones, truly beautiful
This is a huge project and I love it so much that I'm dumb at math.
Wow
Students Vs. Math be like
The music and sound is great
My is my fav if it is show like this
Brooo literally that's all I see in math class
my brain hurt
Это было очень эпично и познавательно))
Based on my mathematical calculations that if 10+10 is equals to 20 then 11+11 is equals to 20 too that's what albert Einstein said to me when i was dreaming
Orange is a mathematician magician.
Solid animation as always, but gotta say, the math references were favorite. Best one was that the e multiplying itself by i sends it to the imaginary spectrum,  followed by how each time it makes a graph, it has to change the power its raised by. Excellent work all across the board
This is masterpiece good job bro
Why don't we learn math like that?
:)
No one told me I was watching a horror video, cut dis shit look scary!!! 2:35 3:08 3:37 5:31
I am confused , do you guys now what e means and the f?
The only math video I'll ever enjoy. This was very amazing.
Awesome!
like aqui si hablas español
woah... Cool...
I gonna pass my math exams after watching this
Br?
That’s brilliantly beautiful 🥲
Wow
me trying to figure out 1 math problem
you should do Animation Vs Raft
It’s amazing how Alan can make maths be interesting with one stick figure.
Bro youtube working very ‘’Good’’ this video is came out 1 hour ago but the first comment came out 8  hours
Alen becker + animation  = 10/10
Hes animations are just so good
Math: The ultimate Evil of the Universe.
THIS IS WHY YOU LERN MATH KIDS
Imagine a teacher ACTUALLY showing this in a math lesson...
this is genuinly so cool tf, idk i kinda got bored of stickman fight other stickman from your main vids but this is genuinly so sick
My guy was on drugs making this
a bigger cliffhanger than infinity war
401,998th viewer xd
bruh so much math that I understand like only 20%
Me acabó de sentir un poco menos inteligente 😞
You have an endless creativity ♥️
Pov: you finally saw an educational thing thats actually entertaining and not just cringe bullcrap from a really amazing animator simply with stickmen and math:
Should i call power of calculation? Unlimited Accelerate time to travel dimension😮
Me knowing that animation is made out of math🙃 But as always, a good video . Love the sound design 🔥🔥
never thought i'd find a bunch of mathematical symbols cute but here i am
wow..
This is why I love math!
Math lore
So, how did TSC/Orange got there?
Now you gotta do Animation vs Alphabets
This is undeniable proof that the moment you add alphabets to math it becomes pure chaos
OMG
Me casually having my mind melted halfway through a maths themed animation
Soo cool Alan’s math record in his brain must b 1000 if bro
How did you make such a boring subject so cool
Bro just helped me with my homework
this video really represents those of us who don't like sin cos tan  ￼
はぁ〜、美しい
Math is amazing
he woke up in manim
I thought Orange was gonna pull out the derivatives to blow up that integral lol.
1+1=2
nice work
holy wow
Man if math is awesome like this,i would actually like it
I think as this is related to maths... We all need to know 7 + 3 = 9
1+1=2
I want an hour long deep video essay explaining this that would be fun to watch
I'm delighted by how much of this I could understand!
How is Alan so talented at this 😮😮😮
YYYEEESSS!!!!!! I'm already loving this hopefully new series Lots Of Love Keep It Up And Stay Positive
Anyone here who hate Math? ^^'  (Also I totally don't mind if you like Math, it's your thoughts. And I don't mind. :D)
Mathematics is really dangerous
inicio 1 + 1 final equaões de física avançada
math teacher= math is easy guys why u cant do that easy task  math be like=
I'll never be able to do math again after that.
I have a feeling Alan had to relearn math to do this
weaponized math.
this is why i hate math xd
I love Math after all I am a school student *Giggles*
That's the only thing that actually made me appreciate math, I'm really impressed with this animation! :o
I barely understand half of this
Okay so, where is this place? How did TSC get there? Is this even canon?
A little kid be like There are numbers belong 0?😢
Alan, can you give me online animation classes?
I hate this but also love this Gotta show this to a school
Props to whoever was in charge of sound design for this video, the background music plus all the little clicks and wooshes made by the numbers was so cool!
It’s so easy, all you have to do is 1+1 and it equals 2. Then you have to add 7 so it would be 2+7 which equals 9 now you gotta divide 9 by 3 so 9 divided by 3 is 3. The final step is to subtract 3 and 1 so 3 - 1 equals 2, and that’s the answer to 1 + 1.
1+1=2❤👍
It`s amazing!!!
This is so fun to watch the fact that orange experiments with math to get "e" and escape is nice and they're always fighting
14:00 I was expecting orange to wake up as it was a dream
This was very silly
This is the best way to learn math
He shouldn't have messed  with it. *it was a canon event.*
Orange right now status: HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Math right now status: the fuck
Me who sucks at math: Oh god, my brain, it' melting from remembering how hard math is X_X
THIS VIDEO IS AWESOME I LITERALLY CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT (I saw this 3 times or more)
Alan Becker's mom: our son will be the greatest mathematician!   Alan Becker's dad: our son will be the greatest animator!   Alan:
Yep that’s math
Stick figure education
Gcses be like
bro my head fucking hurts
Alternative title: stickman plays roblox simulator and tycoon games
wheres the quadratic formula
The beginning of this felt like an indie puzzle game I don't know enough math to beat.
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? WHY ARE THEY SENTIENT? WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING? WHAT IS GOING ON?
The more you watch, the more you understand
customizing your characters genes belike:
This was actually spectacular!! I'm really happy I was able to actually understand the identities used in the video cause it makes it sooo much better
The power of math💪👁️👄👁️
this is confusing, even for someone who had to suffer through it all. great job on the animating though!
この動画を理解するためにもっと数学を学ぶ必要があるな…
it's like interesting non-standard magic and it's cool
Wow! He made the mathematical equivalent of a death star
Godd i wanna see a calculator/ vr game like this
how it feels using manim
เครื่องคิดเลข
Coisa mais 1 + 1 é dois
wow! as always, your animations are amazing! it's a shame i can't give more than one like
Only Alan can find a way to put a mega beam of death in a video about friggin' math.
invert the colors for the shiny version of the video.
Now wait a language lesson)
Orange guy and the multiverse of maths.
When students do not want to learn  math , after this video they will have a passion for it
Orange is getting Smarter😎Than Yellow 😮😅
alan did the impossible , making math interesting for me
I'm curious how the first inventors of mathematics would react if they saw this animation
What’s 9 + 10?
I have 1iq
I Rassian... I LOVE YOU ANIMATION YOU BEST I KNOW ON ENGLISH SOME WORLDS BUT II LOVEEE YOOOOOOOOOU PLZ SEE
I knew how to visualise some of these equation but damn, how you visualised raising the exponent by 1 each time and how it impacted the outcome of the equation was amazing!
This is very cool but some of the math made me confused because i'm going to the 7th grade next in August this year so some of this stuff is new to me
Math is the best during a test will you've get 100
e
no math plz🤮🙏
I calculated literally every math that is in the animation, and they were correct  *Alan is secretly a professional mathematician*
What is 6×3?       6×3!!!!!!
한국인은 나 뿐인가??? ㄹㅈㄷ......
I didn't understand most of the math, but there were a few details I got. However...  ((A + B) x M) / 14.0333̅ = E^2  "A" means Alan, "B" means Becker, so that's his name. "M" means math, so it's being multiplied by A + B since it was made by Alan Becker. That, as a whole, is being divided by 14.0333̅, since that's how long the video is, and all of that equals entertainment to the power of 2.   I may have gotten a few things incorrect, mainly the decimal, but the point still stands.
wow math deha
Meth- I meant Math's pretty pog.
This has taught me more than my school.
Wherevis TSC's friends
1+1=2
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING but why in the summer?  i dont wanna think about math rn :(
So coollllll❤❤❤
So this is the new star wars movie, bringing back the new death star.  As the mathverse almost collapsed due to a orange figure.
Never have I ever thought the day I love math will ever come. Life is full of surprises don't you think?
So detail video😮 Really cool❤
Tron : The Multiverse of knowledge.
That’s so satisfying
I'm dizzy thinking about it because I don't really understand math, at least I memorized a little
Learn algebra from a textbook? No Learn algebra from Alan Becker's video? Yes!!!!!!
This is very exciting, thank you Alan for entertaining us :)
Amazing 😮
это очень очень круто просто шедевр
This video alone made me so happy that I miss school now, also when did math get this cool or was it always like this.
I never thought I'd like math
I think now Orange is now smartest stick guy ever.
can orange teach me math?
What's 2+2????
Thx for this vid bruh need it for the test in math
i was… not expecting vs math.
I am grade 6 I like animation but my brain is burned
HOLY
why is orange in the math dimension? cause i dont remember orange going through a portal that leads to the math dimension....  edit: the vid was awesome btw
Go orange! show that 1+1=2 not 11 or something
Will they make more episodes of these
This is the only time I have actually enjoyed math.
I want Alan to be my math teacher
Its amazing video for youtube
I wish math was like this, it would be so much better
I hate math, this animation makes me love math. You are a wizard Alan
When Alan Becker's Team bored be like:
CHAPTER 2 PLS
You came for the video but you got attracted to every math in it
We need a movie about this one ❤
1+1=2
Who ever made this is insanely smart or used a calculator cuz this is cool
the Smart guy ever
POV: when a series about mathematics is better than all the others
This... Will be at the youtube's hall of fame
absolutely loved it!
How did you even come up with this? Like, seriously, i would watch a whole video ablut the processe that led to the creation of this video.
Oo my Goss
1+1 = 1+1
If every lesson of every theme were so. We should like it. but... it isnt (,:
Holy shit that was a lot of lore
An hour ago and it already has 400k views wow
.
Video crashed you tube
Wow, math
Somehow bro managed to make math so much fun (if it was me... I'd lose this fight hands down!😅)
Hey I don't even know what it is..
:O
Wich the last expo form could do that in real life , vanish out of math
Why I think this video is Alan collage project
Alan você sempre me  surpreende com suas animações ❤❤❤

Kkk
THIS IS INSANE
WOW! Thank you alan becker ,I always like math this animation gets a 15/10.
*Me focus while math* My inside of brain:
Very cool
8:31
His vids are very unexpected ngl i thought hes gonna make the 2nd episode
Imagine the second coming teaching you math subjects
Animation vs baldis basics?
Алан показал мне то - что я не мог понять долгие годы . Спасибо , теперь я интересуюсь математикой >:3
Too many equations! It's already hurting mind!
수학이 예술이었던 걸까요, 아니면 수학을 예술로 표현한 것일까요....
The second coming sure is, smart.
Alan and his team really just single handedly managed to create the only math related video that all of us would willingly invest our time in.
i bet sc had a blast bragging to his friends
I feel so fricking dumb after watching holy moly WHAT DOES ANY OF THIS MEAN LMAO 😂😂
How he can inmagine something like this
Don't worry, he just gets a bit irrational at times.
So cool! Thanks Alan and your team !
My brain imploded
Alan, what percent of your brain did you use to make this video???
Because of you and this video, my brain and eyes are failing me😂
Never thought one could make math worth an Oscar
The music for this one is just simply amazing omg
Que impresionante animación, siempre nos sorprende con algo nuevo.
yellow's been real quiet after this..
頭超痛XD 要是數學可以用這樣的方式學習 遊玩 全世界絕對不差數學專家 可以說人人都是XD
Best moment: 11:19
Więcej tego More of this
Insane
Man the scene where Orange adds "-" to his location to teleport to the other side of the circle was genius!
as everyone has said before, HOW HAVE YOU NOT MADE A MOVIE YET, imagine watching this at the theatres, everyone would go mad from the quality of your works
Dude everyone know that 1+1=2 dude!😮
This was downright beautiful, but WHERE IS 0 DIVIDED BY 0
Its crazy how fast orange adapts.
what an epic
Extremely Outstanding.
col
I didn't expect to learn so much about math in this video
I wish math in school will be such as entertain as this
This proves Alan Becker pays attention in class
I'll watch this video instead of going to school for 12 years 🤣🤣🤣🤣
this is extremely intriguing and impressive mindblowing genius
Math, how simple numbers, functions, and variables can be used to create complexity before your very eyes…😊
1+1=012
Me imagino a Alan aprendiendo matemáticas solo para hacer este video
How to feeling dumb in 14 mins
😮 The power of math
I'm just a Middle Grade person I don't know math! This melts my brain
W + no ratio
Sure the e was powerful, but we haven't met statistics yet O.O
He is just flexing with his skills at this point.
all I got from this is you can make the Death Star with just a lot of math.
Here me out this but a movie
this is officially my new favourite vs video
Do I love your videos? Yes, will I watch every bit of them? also yes. Keep doing an amazing job <3
Math lore
HE'S LEARNING SO MUCH FROM ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?!?!?!
Amazing,good job
"Elementary algebra is just fancy counting. ... There is this ordered sequence of things, these numbers, and they have *one* true behavior: plus 1." — Vihart, "How I Feel About Logarithms" (2013)
I would like a continuation because it's great
Wow!!! This is the best video you have ever made. The music really adds to it. I felt like I was watching the last 15minuites of a dramatic movie like inception!
This is insane I know half of the video but the other half I don't get it but it's still cool maybe the other half is from collage math but wow just wow
This is just...I'm still computing, felt like a fucking dream, incredible man.
im done with maths goodbye
No is 1+1=2
It's like the universe is running
This if fucking amazing. I need to show math professors this
Plz do skibdi toilet vs aniamation and camra man
Learning math from school ❌️ Learning math from Alan Becker ✅
I have learned alot about sin and cos
The start was easy to understand and the sound effects were great. Then 'The second coming' made a primitize bow then a laser gun. Its so amazing to see the knowledge become for advanced and complicated.
Nice 🙂👍
This was actually a good lesson
AvM v2.0?
it feels like watching tony stark doing math in outer space 💀
What gives people feeling of power: Money❌ Status❌ Understanding the math in the video💪💪💪
Гениально
This is so crazy and epic
Bruh i lost all my brain cells taken by this video💀💀💀💀
Great vid alan becker
How about animation stickman vs terraria
It feels like it's a math lore XD
The + end is english so maybe animation vs English next???
waitting for “🤓” comments
so incredibly well-made. my jaw is DROPPED right now
Second coming is Big brain
animation x( csgo)( html)
*constantly learns math"
Next thing you know, Alan and his team makes an animation of the whole stick figure team versus math.
only alan can make maths acutely fun
Tsc just made a death star😂😂
WHY IS THE SOUND DESIGN THE BEST WE'VE SEEN YET???  IN A  M A T H  VIDEO???
THE MUSIC IS GIVING ME PORTAL VIBES
I was hoping to see 0/0 to see what interesting idea Alan would come up with.
Havard be like 1+1= multiversal celular device
1+1 = 2 😂
That was the most fun with numbers I'll ever have in my life
easy 2+2 is 22
School are going to be wild
This is truly amazing. I have never been impressed by math until today! But uh ... what was that last gigantic symbol walking in the background after The Second Coming left?
1 hrs late
13:23 Where math students and teachers cry
this is insane but i still hate math 😉🤝🌚
yall r this smart they didnt even add fractions which i ended at
my brain in the math test
Sigmaballs
Turns math into a 10000000$ plot
Can someone explain what happened at 14:00 ?
Hi
When math is your arch nemesis
the perfect
Omg
Literally a math video but we still watched it
The lord of mathematics 😂
When you used to watch alan after torture of school and now this masterpiece
Second coming become the most genius person or thing.... I ever seen!!!!!
I kinda thought this episode would be related to the animation vs animators. But that was awesome either way
NEW VIDEO!!! rest alan.
I don't understand math on this level 😢
and it all starded from 1=1
Why is math useful?  *to make masterpieces like this.*
😂😂😂😂😂😂HI  1+1=2😂😂😂😂
this video taught me more math than highschool and college
dam bro got some brains🤯
I watch all I feel like school. lmao :]
This is kute
This better be canon
I wonder who wrote the script?
no it 9
I never thought math could look so cool
Why can't I learn maths like this.😢
Alan Becker > Elon Musk + Einstein
Everyone knkws 1+1 is window
I have one thing to say. That thing is *e*
That was amazing! I am a freaking math nerd, and you just makes me love it even more! The fact that I said "NO! NO! NO!" when TSC make 6 / 0 is saying something XD
Infinite is actually not an numder why after 999trillion is? Coz noone knows what after 999trllion
OMG IM 1HOUR LATE HOW CAN I FORGET ALANS CREATIVE VIDEOS :.D
arte
he have ventured too deep into the calculator..
I'm learning to learning math from this video
Even math has its own family
BRO ITS SO GOOD NICE!! i hope there will be second episode for this!
My mind solving the First Math Question in the Exam:
I still don't know the reason for running and fighting of these two
this the only way im learning math
гений
W
what's 9 + 10?
WOW
It’s official, TSC is way too broken even without going all out
Cool animation
Bro literally turned math into something actually cool
I am just about to take my math test, so I'm watching this in hopes that it will give me knowledge.
My favorite stickman animation! ❤
Okay. So... the somewhat eldritch realm that is math.
This is simply teaching mathematics, a Masterpiece of genius.
It would've been so cool of they saw the Mandelbrot Set
the concepts here are so creative what the heck
Imagine if Second Coming was our teacher! That would be wild!
I learned math thx
Damn that’s cool
WOW! I love this video! :D Alan Becker, you are a complete artist!
1+1=2
The power of math
1+1=3 -kim jong un
WTF
I hate math but I found it very enjoyable like this
Leave it to Alan Becker to make math fun
天才すぎる
Idea bank
This is literally Tony Stank when designing a new suit
awesome
The moment the giant one appears it gives me chills. That was just an amazing fight scene (⁠ﾉ⁠≧⁠∇⁠≦⁠)⁠ﾉ⁠ ⁠ﾐ⁠ ⁠┻⁠━⁠┻
Well that was unreasonably epic. I love it
its amazing. it is unique. it amazes how much work has been done to immerse the viewer in the complex world of math through simple animation. bravo!
Terraria but math.
Did Alan Becker have to learn all of this math just to make this video?
The only thing i could think of when the mecha e appear and transform it into a fuction of infinite was:  "Oh no! L'Hopital no you crazy bastard! Ur playing with numbers to big for anyone!"
Bro has to learn scientist level math just for videos. i need To see this in AVM.
who do I choose my gerand or Alenbecker I choose ALENBECKER
This is soo lit
OMG 👍🏻👍🏻
Alan Becker just did all the math in one video
I hate math so I don't understand;-;  But i like this video.
TSC is getting smarter than i think
Fortnite balls
This, Alan Becker... this is a MATHterpiece
big brain time
Alan having the ability to make simple math to a literal anime fight is crazy
Love how א is huge cause its the symbol of infinitey
This is now one of my favorites! :D
love the background song,like in space
That is crazy
1+1 2
as an indian highscholl student who study trignometry ,integration , differentiation like every day i m damm impressed
Math: Beyond Infinity
Alan never fails to impress us. He isn't just creating the greatest of animations, he has the ability to make our nightmares into a living dream. You're the greatest man!
Epic.
This is why i love math
10:01 too cute SFX.
1+1=🪟       ___                       | +|                       -----
I dontt know what to say you are a legend
Ok i cant understand any of this lol
the world then me then a place then some time then in somewhere a place called YouTube the name Alan Becker is such a glorious name the guy of that name has built up just utter amazingness in every way and just that he's amazing then this video of Alan Becker is absolutely totally fantastically informative and amazingly spectacular and completely beautiful, also, I know all thode maths, rotten my brain once when I loved math and even, has deep feelings for the topic of maths
Math teachers better start using this video to teach kids about math lol
math
Bro can you start a maths channel plz 😂
Most cool math video's
amazing, and I kinda understood what math was happening.
1+1=2
When the math is mathing but the brain is not braining.
Smaller head I see
my point of view, (I didn't understand, correct me if I'm wrong) I think the letter "e" is for "error" like making an equation that has no result, like 6 ÷ 0, remembering that it's just what I think it is, again saying if I'm wrong (which I most likely am) correct me anyone who is an expert on this type of subject, I'm not even in high school yet, now I'm going to lie down for a bit because this video left me in pain (I'm serious)
making math interesting? wow, this guy is better then almost every school ever!
...damn... i learned a lot form this...
"MATHS"
Mom: go learn some math Me:
Ø
Make a sequel, my brain requires more knowledge
If math was taught like this, we would all be geniuses
Simplemente increíble. Que nivel de imaginación y presunción a la hora de usarlos números, las propiedades de estos, sus operaciones. Me encantó el video, espero que subas más de este estilo!
clap clap clap
Aghhh is too boring
Tomorrow is my math exam. I think i am gonna pass it , learning from alan tutorial😅😅
Alan can turn anything that sounds boring into a fun videos.
i have a math exam day after tomorrow and i'm watching this.
i think it can help me for Math
Damn, now I like math class!
WOW
i never knew you could weaponize math
Alan becker:hm... i hate math. wait the minute, i think i gonna make it for Animation! Also alan becker:*Need learning math for animation*
This feels like the kind of video a math teacher would show their class to explain some of these concepts.
1+1=82935213729261926
Considering the complexity of mathematics, I'm surprised how easy it was to comprehend the concepts given in the video. Even if it took maybe 10 seconds of screentime, the formulas mostly make sense.
dude! This is an masterpiece of math in my life bro!
ẞřįłĥņ ± 5⁶-⅔·6⁷=ⁿ0,03+⅗=0,00⅙
You make me favorite math again🥸
wow 😶
This is the most awesome, most genius, most impressive and coolest thing I've ever seen.
OMG
I'd will love game like this
Learning math has never been so easy 🤣
Bro became albert Einstein
If only math is this fun to watch
I Don't know Math
Im the 6380th comment
How did u so smart at math -
Niw i can understand math🙂
I understand 0.000001% of that
I wonder how many people will get A's in Math now
My dream a night before Math exam.
the greatest alan becker short of all time so creative
yeah
ITS so crazy
Me trying to figure put the square root pf Pi:
What’s 9 + 10?
Jesus christ, this animation was amazing, as an early math graduate, this almost made me love math again... almost.
I'm going absolutely crazy about this. Excellent job, team.
Wow
Best Animator
I think, I have some idea. Like Music theory?
this would be a perfect vr game
1+1 is 11
Now he's super smart
Going home🏠 and the same time I saw you have Video chat with my friends are the most of us have Vote me and you have video🎥 chat💬 with me and you have video chat with my family👪 and you can get some more and you guys are doing something I would like you do for you want it all the way it
Im early and i dont know what to say
2:56 I love the detail when there’s a bunch of zeros going in since anything divided by zero is technically at infinity
Does it keep the powers does orange keep those powers
1+1=田
I’m semi I stay automatic, money add then multiply, I call it mathematemics
for some reason i laugh at 11:18 because of "BRRRR"
well shit, i understood mostly everything up until mister eiPI decided to make himself... whatever that was. oh and i have no idea what those cosinus and sinus hammers were and why the made the circle... do that thing.   overall, this made me enjoy math again.
Alan litterally showed us that anything can have emotions
1+1=11
here you start with 1 + 1 ending with this
Bro I will no longer look at an exam in the same way...
Cool video idea 🎉🎉🎉
Me: took decades to understand and solve everything (kinda) in math  This orange figure: Rules everything in just 14 minutes
I thought it was gonna end with the + end = ? Like hinting at a sequel lol but this is super good
Okay, that was amazing! Well done! :D Loved it!
jit be teaching me math💀💀
22
My brain in math class:
היה שם "א"
fuck that’s cool
No is 2
What a m4st7r p75ce
Orange and Green is my Favorite Character
i  dont understand in maths . so sad🥲
i feel like i just learned a whole algebra lesson
Bro really helped me for my exam revision
how about SCIENCE?❤
these animations would be fun if it weren’t for alan and the stick figures, am i right?
I'm kinda sad when he didn't do the "0/0"
I didn't know math was so much fun, thanks so much Alan
Ah yes, weapons of math destruction
i actually learned some math from this :D
Congratulations! You hurted my brain🙂👍🏻
You made so many equations that I would never understand
How too play with Math be like...
Nice Aleph in the end!
Aslında turuncu çöp  adam rüya gördü
The best animated subject I've ever seen in my life
I didn’t learn anything 😂
Bro teaching us math in 14 min     (Aka TSC)
math history be Like:
idk whats going on about the math but the video is just cool
2
I'm sure someday teachers will use videos like this one
Confrontation with mathematics is amazing and great!
bro actually taught me more math then i ever did in school, *litterally*
i got my final exam in maths in 2 days, and this video literally just gave me the biggest motivational boost to study for it more intensively. Thank you alan!
Richard Watterson was right. This “Calculator” game does sound like a fun game
There is NO BETTER ANIMATOR than Alan Becker, and i dare you to try to change my mind. Dojo is not even that good, like, damn. Alan, you are the G.O.A.T of all animators
Orange just reinvented math in less than 15 minutes holy shit.
Didn't understand anything, but liked everything.
These Sounds Are Satisfying NGL
Вау, это прикольно
roblox
Plis animation vs color
Holy crap, this was so incredibly cool to watch!!!
Я не знаю что сказать кроме, это прекрасно черт меня возьми.
MATH HAS NEVER BEEN SO FIRE, I DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS THIS BUT I SUPER LOVE THIS
I didn't learn Mathematics for nothing. That battle was epic.
wow, just, wow. i am speechless
1+1= fish ~baldi's basic
I may lack the knowledge to really appreciate the math in this video but at least I give the person behind the sounds a giant prop🤯
I only knew two things before clicking on the video.  1. That I would be thoroughly entertained (as always) 2. I wouldn't be able to follow most of this because this team is terribly intelligent AND clever.
Despite most of maths is useless and defo shit, this vid really just made maths creative
honestly really cool, how it started off with orange understanding the basic concepts like addition and subtraction but how out of contol it became. Love this!!
holy shit math became cool
А тут есть хоть кто-то русский?
Muito bom. BRAZIL🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Alan’s team really knows how to make anything satisfied with their stick figures, even math!
This was posted 1 hour ago.
on the way tranding no1😎
Thousands of years of math in 14 minutes.
you made math scarier than it already is
ah yes
the amount of math jokes in the video.. omg
Help my brains hurts.  (W animation tho)
要打贏這場戰鬥，數學要很好
Just wait till we get to automata theory
Why can't math be this fun.
Bro broke math 💀
the sound effects are EXQUISITE
Why on earth is this better than most marvel movies
Hats off to the creativity ❤💥⚡
Bro made the death star 😂😂😂
I dont understand anything but the fight was epic 🙃👍
The WAAAAAAAAAAAH just made my damn year dude! Thank you for the various animations you have done over time. They have helped me through some dark times including now. Thanks Alan! Please never stop this fantastic work!
I will go to work math
What's 9+10?
this video was mathematically entertaining
My guy explained grade 12 maths in a 14 minute video. Keep up the good work, Alan!
Why do the sound effects work so well with this??????
Math is amazing
An hour in and its already at 350k
This guy just explained what teachers teach us for years in 14 minutes in an animation video💀
Is this gonna be like school or something?
brilliant
The way that Sc turn the plus into cross🤣🤣
Amazing video but how the hell does anyone get an idea like this 😭
Imagine math turned against humans like this
As soon as I saw that 'e' friend, I thought Juhwang would add '1'
Omg 👁️👄👁️The part e yelled
The Best. Creation of wonders.
I missed the premiere :( Like to pay respect
new math update is wild
Someone:must not learn maths for 1 video Alan Beaker:Exactly?
My brain hurts, except for the fighting scenes.
I learned more math in this than any school will ever teach me
now the Animation Vs saga continues
what 1 + 1  =2  bro really dont are you dumb
I wish I had this creativity and culture, brilliant work!
Happy ending :D
Ahhhhhh!!! My Brain is broken now
This is simply teaching mathematics.
He lost me at 1+1=2
fun math
This is so much easier to understand than being in the actual math class, somehow.
this is awesome i wish i could do this stuff
i-...... i- have no words. im so confused. i don't understand....wha- what happening.... its so comlicated for me but now this is my fav animation from you.... i love it
This has to be one of the best video's Alan Becker has ever made!
Math boss fight
We all know that 1+1 = 🪟
Ok but how did TSC get there in the first place?
10+ years of school and I've never been so invested in maths until now.
"What 3 times 3?" The answer is 21...
bro made math fun
DAMMIT I WAS LATE
XD
This feels like material to get a reward man!!! Or at least the first half
Animations math class be like
ah yes normal day on ohio math
Niños cuando consiguen una calculadora:
e Was legend so sad we cant see each other again 😔
Math is boring    Math:
The only way to convince me to learn math
Aidyman’s reactions: view here
-"This is crazy in a good way" -" bro teached me some Calculation better than my teacher fr".
I don’t know anywhere close to enough math to understand what happened but it looked really cool.
Now this adds to the feats of tsc in debates
Calculator the game
Do u play minecraft
T.S.C is just like me with the calculator
What is 9 plus 10?
This is the most epic math battle
Me, a middle schooler:
いい勉強になった！
This video made me love math
and this is where i stopped caring about math 1:39
ALAN YOU ARE A GENIUS
Imagine one day math were like this I will fell in love with math🤣
This was AWESOME
I honestly wasn't expecting the math in this video to make as much sense as it did, huge props
This is the first time math was actually usefull
What are the odds of this video having accurate maths?
Pov:trying to make good comment for likes
I would love to see Math Teachers reacting to this animation 😅
fun science math
I like so much that one
Ты гений!
here is a beggining of a new series
This deserves an award because *sweet lord*... Incredible. I'm speechless
Pls make ava s2 eps 2
You know, I was expecting Yellow to be the one stuck here since he’s the one that’s good with math.
My dumb brain could never comprehend this type of math
I feel like this is the only video from alan becker that actually hurts our brain
apparently, what math needs all this time is great flippin sound design like holy heck this vid is awesome  you gotta make a part 2
2+2 = 22
woo
Alan you are god of animation
do fractions next pls
dude I learned more watching this, then I did ever in school. Thank you.
This solves so many of my math problems
¿Soy el unico que cree que tal vez esta "dimensión numerica" es parte de algun experimento de la organización que capturo a el elegido en AvA 6?
This would be so fun to learn if any high school math teacher taught this
Bro Alan and his team ( i think) the animations are so good and they never get old btw and their so good of animating lol
0_0
Man, my dyscalcula is wrecking this for me. What happened at the end?!
All the scientist must be jealous of how all his discovers of years and years had been discovered in 14 minutes
whats next? animation vs. my singing monsters???
Bro i dont think that math is mathing correctly
Each answer created on each side of equal, will each have their solution to solve their own problem, much cases some can be infinite, and finite, whats also fascinating about this animation is that, all the numbers, solutions, equations and Graphs he makes always have a solution and an answer to solve. And it all starts. With just one number. Even if the answer to the question is wrong. Atleast theres a solution to fix the problem. (No pun intended)
Nunca las matematicas fueron tan divertidas 😂😂😂
y’all sure albert einstein didn’t learn to animate?
My worst nightmare Math
My brain is dead
this is how you make math fun. TAKE NOTES
21÷3=7
Alan backer just used 300% of his brain in this video 😂😂😂
This is the only time you will find math fun.
part 2 pls
Математика ещё никогда не была такой интересной.....
This is the feeling of mathematicians when they thinking about the complex world.
1+1=3нарада вне очереди
WHY THE FRICK DO I know most of the math In this video and I learned it this MORNING 😭😭😭
bro figured out all of math in 14 minutes when we need to go to school smh 🥲
well well, so now TSC has one more feature. He is the first to discover mathematics, at least I think. He could be a "strategist" as well as being the leader of the group
Where was this during high school math class when I needed it?!
Это идиальная матиматическая битва!! 😂😎⚔️
I feel like someone is gonna write down every mathematical equation in this video
Math in ohio💀
I am blown away by this video. As a medical student who has learnt Maths upto 10th class enjoyed this video very much. Thanks for the OG animation and cool sound effects
And so we learn that math can be very powerful. 😅
7:04 oh.. wow!!.. that was amazing!!!
The interaction of euler and the guy was COMPLEX.
Love the sound effects for the operations
all i know is 1+1
Yo
I know nothing
my man put fighting choreography in math and its epic
what the fuck math is cool now
Everyone knows 1 + 1  = 11 Eleven is Millie Bobby Brown  name on Stranger Things
это видио объяснило математику лучше чем многие школы
Sınavda ben
The first time I think math is interesting
Wow it was so beautiful and cool
hi
I'm Not Good At Mathematics :(
damn it was dope. I love it
Alan's IQ must have increased during animating this
M?!
early les go IM EARLY THEN 1 HOUR NICE
This takes math to a whole another level
What's with the Erie music?
Wow 😮
😮😮😮
3:18  OH MY GOD MY BRAIN
Animation vs animatör pls
POV: Your dreams after doing math homework for 5 hours straight
Somebody has to make a game off of this premise
This man is going to revelutionise the earth on maths lessons
JESUS CHRIST! THE CREATIVITY OF THIS ABSELUTE CHAD!!!
the fact that a number as simple as 1+1 can create so many possible sums just proves how unique and precise math is.
that was epic
I'm going to ask my math teacher about this video the first chance I get! Amazing work Alan and Team!
Wow Alan you’ve been cooking since 2012
and thats why I don't make fun of nerds
Nice video tho
Teaching kids to math
Ep 2 of the wanted
Waaaaaaaaaaaaa
Bi like:lu ketika ada ujian matematika
Неее, я отказываюсь учить математику
more like animation verses euclid
We want more🙏🙏
Wooooow  That was soooooooo impresive
I think e was behaving quite irrational throughout this entire animation. I wonder why...?
ehhh my brian hurts!
so orange was erased
I leave a message to remember.
I did not know that math is this powerful 😶😶
I never knew math was so entertaining
I am late aaaaaa😅😅😅
is there going to be a series to this? or is this going to be just 1 episode, because I wanna see more!
1+1 is 2
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is such a good vid keep them coming
Math is getting harder and harder, you even need to kill
You know I would never think that someone could make math look cool or fun.  I was proven wrong
Жду продолжения!!! это было круто!
If the math teachers see this: this is so masterpiece ✨
What is the final giant creature in the end? An Aleph letter?
This must be the first time math has been fun.
I want a math classroom with desks in which the screen can be calculated like this
I love this so much. I'm using this for my exams
dang, this is so good
THIS IS WAY MORE MATH I LEARNED IN SCHOOL!
First time ever i loved math😂
did this stick figure build the death star out of math?
is this canon in the lore?
This has gotta be one of the most confusing alan's video i've ever watched
Never knew I'd watch TSC fight stuff from math, but I guess I am and I'm all for it
The fact these animations tend to be better than Disney…
Now I learned a lot of math
Круто
And yet another lovely animation, good job Alan.
No 1+1 is 2
Perfect  Better than animation vs minecraft.I haven't seen anything like this for a long time. Keep up the good work.
The stick figures better at math than I am.
Wow. Gotta send this to my maths teacher.
the music in the video is similar to the music from Interstellar
I'm watching this 55mins after the video uploaded.
pov school in last day student fight the math teacher
Another AvM.
Anything past 2+2 is beyond my knowledge
What
全世界の人が楽しめる動画 Videos that people around the world can enjoy
1+1=11
finally, he is getting an education

Amazing
Everyone knows 1+1 is 11.
This Is Why Math Is Hard,The Lore.
Nó thật hay và khiến tôi bị thu hút
Everiting i can say is WTF(sorry if i tipe wrong i dont talk english :) )
L bozo math
Make a animator vs animation pt 2
Wow
Hermoso, me encanto todo aunque la mayoria aun no lo entiendo
Nah dude Alan Becker needs First place of best youtuber Bro made a entire 14 minutes animation Of MATH and It was pretty good and needed to Make ALL the Equations  right Thats another level
Uhhh my brain is tired
65÷(0)=∞
I just barely kept up near the end but i was able! I think it all actually checked out too
This was incredible!
Teacher: *teaching math  Kids in the Back:
I learned more in this video than my years in school learning math
1 + 1 = 3 cause when their gonna be 2 they marry and one  baby one so 3
Always knew math could hurt people
Pov: you at first grade
Now we need a Animation vs (programming language)
א
у
This is everyones nightmare before a math test
1+1=4 🤓☝️
Wha
Man if my schools math was like this I wouldn’t have an average of 90% I’d have 99%!
Это видео сделало меня умнее
Just a reminder: Alan did all the calculations just to make this video
Another beautiful and incredible animation by y’all, loved this one a lot!!
This is truly amazing. Math would be a good subject if it were like this
I dont need my maths tr anymore
imagine if red founds out about a calculator
Did someone get what was the huge lesson at the end ?
bro if a math tacher teachs math like this i would go to that school become the number 1 student and he will be my facorite teacher
I’m no math expert, but I think orange just made a rail cannon that accelerates to the point of infinity, which is the most powerful weapon theoretically possible
This thing taught me more than school did.
i need more of The Math Dimension
My brain!!
Animation vs. Math shorts idea: they find a calculator on alan's pc
No entendi pero ok
Woah
1+1은 창문입니다.    한국인들은 모두 이해하겠죠
The Dejavu hit so hard 😅😅 for me on those math formulas soo badly.
Love how this episode doesn’t even have any precursor to the events or anything.  TSC just straight up appeared in a black void and is now doing math.  You did NOT have to go so hard on the visuals for this though, you and the team did amazing on this lol
how does this guy does this so ez but us....💀
hmmm yeah, respect 1.💀
damnn that was freaking so funn :D i like good ending
And now I need frame by frame explanation of this video
Я ничего не понял, но получилось очень круто!
I finally found a teacher to learn more about math
So this is what's really happening inside the calculator
OMG Alan is now teaching math and it is just BEAUTIFUL
Animation vs Minecraft = AVM Animation vs math = AVM  WHAT IS THE REAL AVM?
as a math nerd, i love this video
YOU. NEVER. DISAPPOINTING.
U make math fun
Equations have personality?? What???
Oh, my heart hurts now, that was so cute at the end
Не все знает что 0÷0=00

Alan Becker kiedy dokończenie tego starcia czarnego i tej agencji i głuwnych bohaterów
Five minutes in and im already tryna process what is happening.
This animation change the way i see math
Alan is slowly becoming a nerd now. 🤓      Chemistry next!
He is too dangerous to be left alive
e is friends with orange..
4:42 holy plus
I'm not late, that's great
I have a question 910 + 1=?
Анимация vs Математики, теперь Вы видели всё
I love Maths and I loved this video as much.
Isn't it impressive how it all started with 1.
WHY ALAN? WHY? I'M FEELING HUMILIATED BY A STICKMAN
LET HIM COOK
Orange broke the multiverse of maths
pretty sure i learned math more in this video than from my teacher
this is cool and smooth but kinda hurt my brains.
so cool
holy cow it war soooo epic
수학을 이렇게 표현한다는게 놀랍네요...학교에서 이렇게 가르쳐줬으면 잘배웠을텐데ㅋㅋㅋ 😢
it's like watching a episode of sherlock.
I want to imagine that this was animated on desmos graphing calculator. Also are we getting animation vs music next?
What the f-
I have a Headchea
Alan’s teaching be better then my school ever could
😮😮😮😮
You lost me after 3 minutes of the vid
I feel my mind and third eye has opened up 🗿. I feel i now know the secret to the universe. Which is... STICKMENS ARE AWESOME!
Finally a good use for maths!
The second coming learned like Albert Einstein in a matter of 14 min
I suck at math and all but did math just win?
Ok alan has gone insane
Alan is the only person who can actually make math fun
The fact you did this and made it fun just blew my mind and I only know a fraction of this from 3blue1brown videos so well ty!
I think this is how mathematics should be taught in all schools
Breaking news: local computer  program becomes turing complete by learning the meaning of "math"
One of your best yet
I didn't understand a thing, but man how much more I appreciate your sound design! I wouldn't have been even half as engaged in this without it! Truely an inspiration!
?????
The more you know, The more you understand
3²=6 🤓
1+1-3(4676+86+45)555 +5?
❤❤❤❤How incredible Alan I lovedoooooooooo that animation ❤❤❤❤
way more advanced than I expected but nonetheless incredible really accurate too
Math is pure magic. Its so weird but also amazing. I am so excited to watch this!!!
e and The Second Coming have a good relation ship :)
fantasy at the height well done alan beckerfantasy at the height well done alan becker
A normal person: damn, this animation is so complicated Meanwhile an asian: Is this children's cartoon
​amazing how it all started with 1
There were times my brain went: Animation VS Internet Explorer
24:00:00
Alan, you and your team have turned my favourite subject into a dream come true. you guys can turn everything into a work of art. well done all of you!!
Damn he made math a battle simulator 😝 now i started to like math
Someone: Math is boring Math:
My brain in math test be like:
Aprendi matemática mais com esse vídeo do que com todos os meus anos de escola kkk
Wow math equation is the best and the animation
me when my math teacher gives us homework packets:
I'm not smart enough to understand what's going on here, but I am smart enough to understand that it's very smart 😊
This video taught me more than my teachers did
2+2=5!
Everyone knows 9+10 is 21
Pls continue the wanted episode
Все: Выучили математику за 9-11 лет  Тем временем Второе происшествие за 14 минут и две секунды:
After watching this video, my interest in mathematics woke up.
the only video that can make me love math
Dude, in this video, I officially learned math from the beginning
everyone knows is 1+1=1
13:48-Wth is that giant thing walking?!     Also,seems like even animation lose against math.
This man created the most intense math battle ever
My brain isn't hardwired for math. I just don't get it. But... even I'm able to recognize that math can be beautiful 😎
Animation, perfect sounds, perfection Alan?  an animator god among men
I didn’t understand half of what just happened but it looked sick though!
Soooo , the next video it's gonna be Animation vs physics
i just want to say what is bro doing
wow that was something else very amazing job alan and his team so cool
1+1=7
e^iπ+1=0 can be said to be an extremely simple equation. Why is it called the most beautiful equation in the world? This is because it forms a single equation. In addition, the four basic operations of mathematics, exponents, and equal signs were all used. therefore beautiful
Can you do  wanted ep2 who with me👇 pls
the funniest thing here is this MIGHT have taught someone math better then math teachers do
Bro, the animation too good, i cant imagine❤
This is the most weirdest but also cool battle scene I have ever seen
damn this is fire
The math is way too complicated
Alan must be very good at Math and Animating to make this video
Too many good parts. One cool one was the megabeam but like, c'mon everything was epic 🤯
This is how people will learn math
good thing i payed attention in my math classes or else i would still understand it, you should start a teaching channel i bet u $0.0001 that people will ace in math with it
Lol
eline saglık
MATEMATICAS HIJO
I wonder what if I just did this 1+1=2 1+1 11
That animation was bussin.Keep it up Alan❤
Im too lazy for thinking math in this video
This doesn’t breaks the laws of mathematics, it literally follows them
Is a 2 😂😂
never thought math would be so enteresting
make part 2
I Hate math:)
My brother vs math
Why there is aleph in the end
I like how e^(i*pi) became the antagonist
This animation made me realise how much I know and how much I don't know math *yet* .
All of these math equations are true
my brain just exploded on the Mega advanced Aldabra
YAY Another video from alan becker!
bro really just mastered mathematics, graduated, and got a degree in less than 15 minutes. everybody's dream.
That's so beautiful and original animation 😍
He's beginning to believe... he might create, the matrix.
Awsome. It's..WOW
Alen becker how did you made this cool animation i wish i have that!
my brain: what the hell did I just watch
😭 thank you
that idea is crazy
1+1=2
1+1=2
Wow
It kinda looked like tsc didn’t know simple math which is funny but either way this is amazing
AT 10:32 T.S.C. (the second coming) AKA orange HAS THE DEATH STAR!!!
One of the most epic animations Ive ever seen.
Dios mío esto es brutal, cuando estudiaste algebra y análisis matemático y entiendes mayormente lo que están escribiendo es una locura y una idea super creativa de plantear una animación, esto literalmente esta a otro nivel de creatividad. Literalmente Alan es uno de los mejores animadores que existen.
❔
Eu Quero Mais Episodes
Nice try, but I still don't understand the math
Bro just made the exsitence of maths from his brain and the calculator btw at the end i was blessed of how much i know how it become friends with ie
.........
Best animation vs series so far
Damn tsc is in killing spree! Nice!
Holy shit this man made math go hard
Damn, how I missed this in mathematics, the concept of those proofs are insane
If anyone was wondering i is imaginary number and i x i = -1 (probably no one cares)
TSC really can beat math
If only Math was this fun
I don't know why but Alan Becker is just so much better than most animations, and math is so fun in this video, it's like a video game to me! Very interesting and educational.
Bro just be came the master of stick man calculation
Now we are waiting for physics, chemistry and more!!
Bro took YouTube likes education way to far
11:26 bro went into the light mode dimension
dude eee we need part 2
Animation VS Scientists Next 😅
That's some crazy math lore here
this is my fav video in your channel this is really good animation ! =)
🤓
I have 2 question , why orange was goes there number 2 where is he gonna go
Therefore, math was created.
ALAN , THIS IS COOL
Efsane yaa
bro went on math story mode💀
I like how he broke the rupture between infinity and time.
I like to imagine that this all happened in TSC’s head while he was messing around with the calculator on Alan’s computer.
Sin palabras
the animation is so clean:D
They most scary video what i see un My life
1+1=2
I"m sure that in the future generations teachers will show this video in math classes and everyone will be making comments like "who's here because of homework?", so let's apreciate that it hasn't happened yet
How are you so OP ???????!!!!!!!!!!!
ayo is that Euler number  this is so epic
Tsc beated alberts einstyns world record id appreciate that
Animation vs. *Don't Starve*
If i knew what i and those cos and sin were for i would had much more fun!
this feels like a 2010s movie-
Да
الله اكبر
Safety in numbers, I guess
This is going to become that video played in most math classes to show why math is cool. 😂
Math lore:
Bro holy hell the end fight was crazy  how
This video made me to like maths
1+1=2 (not commentary)
No way
3:49 虚数出てくると興奮する
1+1=2
Hi
Why?
After this wanted episode 2
Oh yeah, new alan becker video
Absolute GENIUS. No really, what the hell with this? Why is DC doing the Flash crap and he's doing this? Simply amazing
"Mathematical!"- Adventure Time.
TSC getting PTSD from putting his hand in the 0 😂
G.O.A.T
Plot twist, he was betrayed and killed
Well, at least sc found a use for algebra.
what 9+10?
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
God ending D==[::::::::::::>
10:02 "WAAAAAAAAAH!!!" 😂
Now I understand the math , thx bro
I dont understand shit😭
Did you just make Math actually cool? :O /pos (positive comment)  Edit: Broo, this is so cool holy crap
Can you make Animation vs. Roblox Pls
Ohhhh boy... I know juuuust enough of mathematics to know juuuuuuuuuust how little I know of principles on display here.
The best video and easiest video to learn maths
MATCH TOP
Your animation improved a lot, at the same time this is a bit informative as well. 💯
ė
Я когда заешл в калькулятор
I can't even imagine how long it must have taken to work out all the equations needed to make this
but the big question is, what is The + End?
Bro my brain broke. I was actually solving in
Cool
Damn, the way the story progresses is amazing. From 1 or basic math to advance math. I also like how their technology also advances along with it.  I'm just curious why the e symbol is the enemy? I always saw it whenever I calculate decimals in my calculator.
Im sure orange can pass math test
Aprender matemáticas nunca fue tan divertido
fours exit:
bro taught me more maths than my enitre school and college yrs 😂
Bruh its 2
my mind blows
Can you pls make a animation of the orange guy is stuck in a circle?
Yea
875556555544675357%876668
Bro learn faster then my me
1+1 is window
I wonder if there is “The - end.” It could be a bad ending, but why would we want to see that?
oh my god it was so amazing! it like a movie wow
Bro just casually figured out math in under fifteen minutes 😑
Everyone 1+1 is 11
the moment when i see math is cool
LOOOOL
Everyone knows 1 + 1 is a window
This stickman took 10 minutes to learn whole math.
54 minutes
한 명의 이과로써... 진짜 가슴이 웅장해지는 영상였습니다. 수학의 발전 과정을 보고 있자니 감정에 북받치지 않을 수 없군요
I know IT   Math is bad
313,108th!
The second coming and me is so confuse
Bro is learning🔥🔥🔥
What
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAA
sheeesh, that musinc with this sfx, that is amazing bro. :) i have a ideia for the next vid "Animation vs. Quantum Physics" lol
He know the real Magic now...No one can stop him
Para esto nos entrenaba nuestro profesor de matemáticas
alternative title : second coming becomes smart to beat the letter E
This is the best way to come out as a nerd
this proves math is both evil and misunderstood
This is actually a really genius way of visualizing how math works...
Living proof that maths are deadly!
Those 14 minutes were definitely the most entertaining time I had looking at math.
Hahahahahahhaha
I feel like such a nerd for understanding all the math references.
2 math teachers from different school fighting:
Wow
Lol
Ya lo termine de ver y woow que creatividad
نحن تعبناك جدا اسفين
If Alan is your teacher of math:
POV you start playing with the calculator
The best
Никогда бы не подумал, что математика покажется такой интересной 😮
my brain vs math
NO 1+1 its 2
I liket it so mutch, math is the inkredebilst subject of oll time, maid a nother viedeo ples
Why do I feel like this is tsc rifght now uncounscious in one of those floating motorbikes somehow learning math and he uses them in season 2 episode 2 of AvA
I did not think there could be something interesting about mathematics
❤❤❤ Ideals
If I try to describe how amazing this video was, I'd be here for an hour. Incredible job with this, as a math major seeing all these different concepts used in such unique ways had me geeking out the entire second half of the video :P
Wow how is the second coming not scared by this?😂😂😂
How tf did he even get there in the first place?
I’ve never been so intrigued in math 😮
These 14 minutes video were more interesting and instructive that my past 14 years education
I only understand the start but soon when it got further, it made me lose a brain cell after seeing all the madness
Even a stickman is better than you at math💀
Eu só endendi até aqui 7:10 , o resto, foi só dor de cabeça, Ps: to falando serio, estou realmente com dor de cabeça dps desse video
this actually made me want to learn math... i wish you were my math teacher XD
ah so it's gonna be a simple video about basic maths- *Suddenly throws in Euler's identity*
0+0>0
Dose, I loved the video, no wonder I wanna be a math teacher
эта чиста математика
aku benci matematika
For Alan Becker 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What's next? Animation vs Science?
Xd
They really said math can be fun.
I ONLY UNDERSTAND THE MATH UNTIL 3:36   HMMM thats a lot of learning.
Me in every Math class:
1+1 this is so good man
Bro made an educational video out of a stick figure
0:18 addition 1:22 subtraction 1:45 e1pi 2:28 number parenticis 2:44 division 3:05 power 3:40 square root 3:54 i 5:22 point or decimal point 5:34 curcumference or circle 5:54 radius 6:27 angle of a circle 6:40 pi 6:45 sin and cos made 6:53 algebra wave in circle 7:04 the machine of algebra wave of a circle idk 7:34 the monster e and nums 8:18 the fight continues 14:02 the end
Me when I do my math
This was so unexpectedly cool
이런거 만들 시간에 마크나 올려
This is also the first time orange (known as TSC) know math
Cool Animation
• Makes me feel like a kid again messing with the calculator. 😄❤  • I could imagine so much more potential like a sequel, add more calculus or physics. But a lot of high level concepts were already used. Or turn these into “An Actual Short.” • If more is made like this I’d like to see the Chosen One just toying with a TI-84 calculator or Desmos. Also more simple concepts, more derivatives and integration; they were too briefly shown. • Thank you for this video!
I have 0 clue what on earth is going on in the second half of the video, but I still enjoyed it.
This is the best mathematical blockbuster
Wow
14:03
animation vs meth!!!1!1!
I want a tiny stickman to do my math for me
ohhh what is the+end=?????
that was Actually so cool..
Good video
СЛОЖНО , СЛОЖНО
How did simple math turn into a battlefield
He really forgot about Roman numerals. But good job.
Another rising of AvM(ath)
My brain cells during exam😂
omaga
That was splendid :)
Oonga boonga brain hurt but the animation looks so great
51 min ago
Amazing!!! *o*
1487 year old math teacher vs student with an A.I. calculator
it's next level video.
I loved it. Keep up the good work :3
10:31 my guy made a bfg 10.000 with the mathematics
0:00
Is he dead?
FABULOUS!
I was ready to bust out my calculator to see how accurate this is, but then I realized it's 14 min long. Lol
sure is fighting with math
so, where is season2?
This is awesome what the hell
episode two episode two episode two!!!
Who is that big grey one in the end?
clim your within an hour ticket here
3+5=35
I did not learn any math from these math class
Everyone  knows
bro made math interesting 💀
Isso está incrível 🎉
1 day ur gonna have 100k likez
I can't believe it! You're incredible!
Как, как до этого можно додуматься?!   Но эта анимация просто шикарна!
"This is much better then doing my homework!"
GOD I LOVE THE SOUND DESIGN AND THE ANIMATION AND EVERYTHING ACTUALLY
1+1 = wanwan
We need the game of it
Incrível
Claim your within a minute ticket here. (f4)
Its obviously 1 and 1
only Alan Becker can make math fun :)
2+2=22
this is why you should learn math.
So how did he get there?
1:10
1+1= 😞.     🙁.                      😧.                     Uhhh  wow this is hard. Wait I  😦 DONT LIKE MATH!    😐.      🫥 AHHHHhhhhh
I. dont have words. This is. Amazing^100
This is what the math movie should really look like
WOW!!! It must have taken SO long to do all this math! Seriously this is an insane animation! Keep up the great work!
1 + 1 = The Second Coming
nice animation i wish i could be like you
Teacher: The test won't be that difficult The test:
video: 50 minues ago comments: 4 hours ago
Я один воспринимаю видео Алана как искусство мультфильма.
@FajrulFx
Самая увлекательная алгебра в моей жизни
It is pure genius
making a whole story with just math symbols and a stickfigure, now thats what i call creativity
Boruto📉😂Lol
It’s all fun and games until orange finds the calculator app
this is too confusing
my head hurts so much
My-my poor stupid brain
69:9
Epic battle of mathematics Lol
More please
that was sick
I feel like there are lots of things here that I should understand but I don't
wow that was so amazing
They should teachath like this
Im so gonna be in trouble if i have to learn this kind of math 😢. (Send help!)
Note : -  for Making This Video any type of harm is not done to  any math expert 😅😅😅
I like math
Alan just successfully made math look fun a creative
Who has the mathematical eyes, already always has been seen and watch the entire universe as these wonderful video...  and i envy them..
Not even halfway through and I can say confidently this is one of my favorites.  Not only is the animation and sound design fantastic, but the subtle teaching (especially with the multiplication and division parts) is superbly clever.  I want a 3blue1brown collab now  [EDIT]: Oh my god the trig and complex plane introductions were spectacular! Euler would be proud of you!
1+1=π
Man I want this be my calkulator
Damn boi
Это шедевр, автору большое  уважение😌👏👏👏
How do you even get the idea to do this
This is Math Lore Right now
Thanks for the lesson, now I can graduate college 🙏🙏
Man this is the only guy that can make math sound cool
Bro really made math into a battle
Wait what??? I didnt realize that im 36 mins late right when i started watching this
Kid prodigy vs math teacher.
i^4=exiπ ?
very very nice animation
I think your math you got  A+
Can you make a series with this?
Animation moment
Didn't know maths can be animated like this it was 🔥🔥 man after seeing this i think i will get a little bit interested in maths 🗿👍 this video was very fantastic
Everyone watchin be calm and confident until e^iπ
this video is just to show off alan's math skills
This was incredible, the creativeness was awesome
This is the most useful and beautiful math in life
"Oh my god it's Albert Einstein"
1+1=2
:) ???????????????????
guys they are in the matrix
I wonder if Alan had to teacher himself this stuff again or if he already knew it
2:08
❤that so good Video ❤ =>
Bruh. That would of taken forever to make lol.
Who knew that math could be so epic
Me and the boys what we wished math should be
Everyone knows 1+1=2 :D
1:36 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Alan Becker and his team are genius of our era. I can watch this forever!
I won't skip algebra any more!
no no no NO I JUST GOT VACATION WHY ARE YOU BACK  MATH?!
yo Alan Beckar
This is what I think when I studying math
Knowing math is one thing, but how did you make them COME INTO LIFE??? THAT'S JUST SO CREATIVE i literally giggled every time i saw a new concept emerge. the subtle א add the end puts the cherry on top. simply amazing
when the stick figure is smarter then you
Bros albert einstien he created math 😂😂😂  Edit:sorry if i accidently prounounced the name wrong english is not my 1st language
math is already an interesting topic, I love the geometrical stance you implied and the funny tautologies the stickfigure does
The animation on this was INCREDIBLE This was such a fun watch!
Ahh yes (-)×(-)=(+)
WOW
10:59-The function shouldn't still be at the center of the circle?
me after completing maths homework at 3am
So I love math
There's a word in the Portuguese language for it FODA
HE MADE İT HE MADE THE İMPOSSİBLE POSSİBLE  ... making math fun
ma5ths
Lesson story of the video, math is deadly so stop math in school
where the orange????
9+10
When people ask you why your favorite subject is Math, show them this video
I have dyscalculia and this was still hella enjoyable thanks alen 😁
I was really hoping they do the 0 / 0 thing
best animation ever
I JUST FREAKIN WASTE MY 12 YEARS TO LEARN THAT GOD DAMN MATH AND A STICKMAN GOT IT JUST IN 10 MINUTES!??
bro,i learn more math than school in just 1 video 💀
1+1 is 2
this is the perfect excuse for watching youtube when i'm supposed to be studying
Meth
9:29 The music is perfect here
Whats 9 plus 10 = 21 had a lot of meaning
What is that?
AN EPIC
I think orange stickman is very intelligent now
I couldn't forget my admiration while watching this video
20/10 and GOD
Bro’s a genius💀
The + End
This is the most insane thing I've seen today
I Feel Smarter After watch this
I have no worlds or numbers to describe that wonderful, it's been a long time Alan cross the limit of animation I know.
egg
*bro created a prediction of an epic fight for the number lore*
5/0=?😅😅😅😅😅 NOW WHO CAN'T DOIT THE REPONDE IN THE COMMENT❤❤❤❤
what i feel when i solved 6th grade math while being 2nd grade:
me vs math
aint no way he made math to a animation fight scene
my brain is fried after watching this..
The guy founded the math is proud of the second coming (orange)
Teachers NEED to take notes from this video
I think alan run out of ideas
WHAAATT BIG N??? BLACK 😳😳
I have a headache
There will probably not be a part 2 but if there is.
WoW
Is it accurate?
Math would be cool if it was like that...
Damn you turn the boring math lessin into an epic math solving fight :O
IDK what to say because I'm early gang  | | |
This is the only Math exam that are entertaining and not brain breaking 😅
What is 9+10
That escalated quickly
Pls me talk Who thinks 1+1=11 is so STUPID
This is well done, I always am a fan of quick but clear movements and wile I do love action mystery and suspense will always be at the top.
Super Amazing math animation 😍😍🤩🤩
ALAN!!!! u did not need to go so HARD on the sound design jesus its sounds AMAZING
1 hour gang 👍
Where is Quaternion :)
항상 생각하는 건데 얘네는 진짜 학습 능력이 넘사임 ㅋㅋㅋ 무슨 고등 수학을 10분만에 마스터하냐고 ㅋㅋㅋ
Pls make mathematic fight next
Nah the sounds sound like pacman so much bro
It turned from basic math lvl into advanced math lvl into astronomy lvl😳😳🤯🤯💀💀☠️☠️     My braincells hurt now🥲🥲
I wish you made more animated videos like this one focusing on random stuff instead of wasting your artistic talent on Minecrap of all things!!
My man literally said let’s compare math with elden ring
Huh.. I guess school really DID pay off
wat
Orange casually rediscovering every math theorem known to man
48 mins old when i first saw this
тτ
Это надо показывать на уроках математики.
Ujg
I learnt more in this than in school fr
The + End = Fin
its my time to shine! 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓
Amazing video bruh, pls bring back the second coming 🙏🙏🙏
e^iπ=-1 moment
48 MIN 🎉
how im gonna describe this cool asf animation 🔥
Blud really defeated math with math💀🙏🏼
now we need animation vs chemistry
Me in math class Nevermind
creative level: god
Sweet cheese strings that was awesome
Man you managed to make math look epic bro I not sure how I feel about that 😂😂
10:00 I feel like I'm back in my college calculus class!
This video is weird but amazing and at the end kinda sad
YESSSSSS
I can already see the "Maths professor watches "Animation vs Maths" Videos appearing XD
Yesss Sirrr
Reminds me of the clip dude vs TCO
If math were alive
This is how people had math battles back in the day
my brain cells right now🤯
Who has a hatred of math?
We all gonna ignore he made a perfect circle on 5:34 ?
bro explained the basics of mathematics batter then my math teachers in one stickman video 💀
But that’s crazy because it all started with number one 😮
This is exciting dude
This was better than everything i have ever seen in my life😂❤
I Didn't understand anything here. But i wasn't unimpressed. :3
that was cool too good  how do you do this super very hard animation
orange is the smart one
5:21 reminds me of the Minecraft block
BROS the first stick an to be smart
2+2=22
This made me like math so much the sound effects and the animation is just phenomenal
The + end is the end so 1+1 gotta be 11
The Second Coming is Good At Math
bro posted this right after my math exams
this video was too much for my brain
Bro learned math quicker than i did And im asian, so thats saying something
this is how math is if you have a good teacher
He's no longer an Animator He's already my Physics Instructor
what the hell math?? i don’t know anything about this, this whole time i watched i’ve been so confused
I think this might be my new favourite video of all time. The maths spoke directly to my soul. Words cannot describe my joy, absolutely loved this video!
this is so cool i love everything about it
Alan, you never seize to amaze me with your ability to make an understandable and great story without words or facial expressions but only with body language of things that are often don't even resemble a living creature and that's not even mentioning the amazing fight scenes and creative ideas and this was all done with maths. You are an amazing person.
Better than the maths lectures
as a guy didn't even know what ø means it is a good video
As a nerd i can confirm this is wth i see when i solve a math
And that kids, is how math came into being.
Maybe everything have life
orange be playing cod zombies while doing his homework 💀💀
Мне кажется мне стоит посмотреть это видео когда стану умнее
NoEw it's time for everybody's favorite subject, Math!
Всё пробуешь новые высоты? Классный контент!
This math and 3 dimentional stuff just messed up my brain in a cool way,keep it up Alan 👍
Wow! This is just amazing!!!
Amazing. 🤩🤩
So  if 1 = 1 and 2 = 2. Then 1+1= 2. Then I do 1+2. Who’s do 3. So Half-Life 3 is confirmed 👍🏻 ( idk how explain perfectly )
This video is very awesome 😮 How do you do that
I came at the speed of pi.
Can someone explain why e= minecraft 2
What is  mathematics?
Claim yalls 1 hour early ticket here
Bro newton is back💀
I honestly love the thought that this whole world here and everything in it all started from 1 and a symbol.
Nothing to say, i just chilling with this one
I overlsept
And now we know that the second coming is not only good at fighting but at math too
nah bro animation vs. meth is better
*The Math people who dont know math* 😐  This is the most confusing animation you made so far Alan becker😅
why the math not like that goddamn it you make the math looks fun
1+1=11😎
This is just... beautiful
The real number lore
Can’t wait for animation vs English and the rest of the subjects
asmr
i kinda suck at math
I wanna see "Mathematician Reacts to Animation vs. Math"
R.i.p kid 6 years old after watched this video
Bora tirar a sua arma e prendelo numa dimensao que ele nao possa sair  laranja achando uma arma mais poderosa a saindo da dimensao
literally everyone and math be like :
I+I glue
That was something that you thought of in college
It's the little things, like Orange flipping along a vertical axis when hit by the minus symbol that makes this one of my favorite Alan Becker animations by far.   Also I love the Aleph cameo at the end
Bro is better than math teacher 💀💀💀💀
I like how alan just made a whole new combat sytem for math
Now THIS is how you get people invested in math at school!
Awesome Video Alan! Make A Pt 2
🔥
The fact that ALan becker had to research all of these makes it better
why did i learn more from a fucking stick figure than my math teacher???
MY BRAIN CAN'T PROSSES THIS INFORMATION!!!! IM TOO DUMB IN MATHHHHHHH!!!!!
Now this is how you create weapons of Maths destruction      Edit: I'm not going to apologize for the pun
Logic and brain hack (brain explode sound)
Me with maths:
Man, math would be a helluva lot more fun if we could do stuff like this. Alan is just that one youtuber who never uploads a bad video
I don't even know this math
hey can you make the continue of the last episode with victim i'm waiting for it
Oh boy ... like just wow  What was that ! I'm literally stunned by all that beautiful work
🤯
Damn aleph is that big?
Me trying to learn what some of the math is
Omg, I enjoy this so much. For being a lover of math and math major this was amazing. I wish this is how math taught so people can have fun and easier time with it.
My teacher doesn’t even know about all off this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but good work alan😊
this has easily surpassed 99.9% of every math teacher's jobs. we NEED an explanation video!!!
The second coming is now Einstein and 1+1=🪟window😊
This was amazing, I'm gonna need a breakdown just to see the all the little things I probably missed because of how quickly they went. I love how e gets all that because of how many places it shows up, and the way aleph showed up at the end as being made of the plane itself was great. I also love how the tangent function is used to zero out the e minions, but then the big e integrates the tangents to zero them out
I’m watching math…and having fun with it!
We got vs gaming, vs animation but vs education? That so genius
This is teaching me at math
This is pretty good alan
Huhu the subject of my weakness, my brain can no longer accept😵😵
i really want to write something smart, but i dont know..  nevertheless, it is a MASTERPIECE -as always
I see the true purpose of math now: i*sin and cos death rays.
A orange stick figure learned math before I even cared about it
S/O to Alan. He took the time to master Math itself for this video😌
Gooooooood
Imma use e^i pi as my answer next time
Before 300k visit. WOOHOO
The 2x2= bow is the coolest thing I’ve seen all year. God my math nerd self is just SQUEELING at this animation
10 × 10 is 20 but 11×11 is 20 too
6+6 it's. 66🤪
its funny how all of this is correct math
New series :D
help me solve 1+1
After this video, math became even harder than I thought 💀..
COOL🔥
This video made me lose more brain cells 😭😭 I do love the animations it's cool but I still hate math
omg
My worst enemy why TCO is in the video he can easyly destroy it
If there are any college math teachers in the comments... PLEASE EXPLAIN!!!
I gave up when I saw 1
This is brilliant! Explaining maths without words? No I am speechless! 😶
Alternative title: Math but fun
Man this animation is so smooth.
its been 40 minutes and this already has 6k+ comments and think of the har work Alan did for that
And just like my normal math lessons, i only understood about a tenth of all those formulas.
Only alan the one that can make perfect stickman story
Math + funny stickman = fun to watch
This is my rivition
Beautiful!
YEAAAH, so cool, now the stickman know math lol
yes
mathematicians frothing at the mouth dissecting this
Suddenly I found math so interesting 😂😂😂 Alan, thx for letting me like math againXD
i love this so much
TSC broke math 💀💀💀
Bro mastered the math art of putting stuff together in math class and making it good
HELLO ALAN BECKER
凄いな、アランにはいつも驚かされる
Yo Knows How Talk Knows To Sing The Alphabet. HE CANT EVEN SING HIS NUMBERS TILL TODAY BRUH
Now I'm learning math from tsc 🤓🤓🤓
I learned maths now
Claim your 🎉 if your here before 1M Views 😉
7:46 Ohhh Similar to the one used by the AvA Victim's mercenaries.
TSC just breaks every rule of math
The music was kind of creepy
Cool animation Bro :)
WOW Alan Becker it is SO BEAUTIFUL AND INTERESTING
My 🧠aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
My brain died trying to understand the math things of this video 💀  Also,👏Alan becker,you turned math into guns,swords,a mecha,and lore 👍
why is no one talking about the "WAHHH"
Someone has to make this into a new graphics calculator.
The stick figures probably have school and the most hated subject is math like me💀
WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This is downright amazing. Kudos to Alan Becker, having the best animations yet still improving it video after video
Next is animations vz therapy😂😂😂😂
Man, he really knows his math
What did you make
Yo song is so cool
animation vs METH
This is why they teach you math in school, so you can battle mathematical principles with mathematical formulas
Asian powers ACTIVATE
I surprisingly actually understood most of it.
I can already see "Mathematician reacts to "Animation vs. Math"
Man I got to get me into this math stuff.
This animation looks really Great! can someone tell me the backstory behind it pls
I would bet Yellow would like this place. :3
e ¡ñ must mean infinite
Everybody knows 9+10=21
Que locura este video, gracias por subirlo me gustó muchísimo. Me gustan todos tus videos 👍👌😂
Become my father, idk math!
Alan exposed the greatest agreement with me. The cosine and sine functions are the powerful ones that could create a break in reality itself.
Ohh this is new
Cool
Sheeesh
Ичо
It's amazing that Alan and his team always manage to produce masterpieces with any kind of theme. I loved the video.
Making math lessons cool × infinity.
Learn math at school: ❌ Learn math in this video: ✅
imagine if the transformaiton of each number especially "e" is actually acurate
Now do animation vs science 🤓
6am video nice 🎉
what the actual indevisible ghost dicken fuk?
❤It's very cool graphics in addition to a very cool math equation ❤
The amount of math that Orange has learned in this single animation, he’s smarter than we give him credit.
dude's ideas never end 🤩
how am I LEARNING MATH BETTER\>!>!!?????? WHAT KIND DARK MAGIC IS THIS, WHAT IS I?!
Superbe animation elle est ingénieuse elle a dû demander beaucoup de préparation un travail différent que pour les autres animations c'était très intéressant
someone break out the desmos rick roll
Bro just learn all what i know of math in 8 minutes💀💀💀 (Orange the G.O.A.T)
where animation vs animator VI 2 episode
9:48 my math exams
Thousands of years of mathematical history were understood in just 14 minutes.
No word❤
2023 kids learning maths: watching Alan Becker's videos
The World War "π"
Imagine this as a game
This video makes me  now love math thank you :)
A
man this is so creative
e
Im in confusioon-
They should play this video in Math class cause HOLY FRICK I WAS SO INVESTED AND ONLY ALAN BECKER CAN MAKE MATH SO FREAKIN INTERESTING WHAT-
Yay early
Am I the only one who saw the letter א' from the Hebrew language in the end?!?!? Or is it somthing else?
Playing with the calculator in math class be like
i love how orange is just messing around, when he makes e(iπ) and some goofy math fight breaks out
I love it he should do animation vs english
Wow
This was funny
this is soo fricking awesome
Do Animation vs fnaf
Вау
I don't understand anything but I love this
35635×2=71270
I really hope this becomes another sub series/ series.
This pure genius😂
Good job
mathmatic titan, I love it
א
I learned more from this video than all my years in school.
The best way to teach math
nothing is clear but very interesting
Are you freaking KIDDING ME!?!?!?! Show THAT to the kids at school!!!🔥🔥🔥
Demorei um tempo,mas fiz todos os cálculos dessa animação e posso concluir que está correta
yeah science
My brain after watching this video:🧠💥
When from elementary school math TO A HIGH SHCOOL MATH
1+1=111,111
nice
My brain when I'm learning my language:
Only Alan can make maths into a weapon, arrows, extendo tools and a being that fights back.
Dis is my favorite i wish i am one of your friends😢
9 + 10 = 21
New series?
Where's the next Espiode anyways?
Aprendendo matemática na pratica é tipo iso
Oh man I'm starting to lose my mind from math💀💀💀
I love you Alan and Math
Very Good !!!
And here we are again.
M
I learned more math from this video than from school))
pov: math
Wow the beam berak infiniti
This is the best thing I've seen today thanks
this man learned more math & faster than i did in my entire life
Orange head are now small :0
Алан ты лучший анимация просто шикарная ( мне после этого захотелось выучить математику)
Waouh la vidéo est trop bien (faite aussi) en plus éducatif(je sais pas si c'est éducatif), bon par contre il y a des choses que je comprends pas parce que je suis entre la 4e et la 3e. Mais je connais le googol et le googolplex.
Alan is the only person who can make a video about math and people actually be excited for it
You can't make math interesting!  Alan Becker: I BEG TO DIFFER
I don't understand whats happening but i love the animation so smooth
Next: Animation vs *Meth*
Did you know 10 + 10 is the same as 11 + 11 look 10 + 10 is the twenty and 11 + 11 is twenty too
The 7 yr olds watchin:
I have some much to say i dont even know where to start.
این ویدیو کاری کرد که من به ریاضی علاقه مند شم🤣👌🏻❤️ Thanks alan!

THE LEGEND IS BACKKKK
DUDE, this animation is off the charts ! I absolutely love the attention to detail everywhere, you clearly see this has been polished to perfection
It's very interesting that red "discovers" from simple to complex math operations. Plus to multiplication, imaginary numbers and beyond.
SCP and WOD would stomp this verse with equal and no cosmology, but with cosmology, they literally fricking solo the 2.
I love how creative this is
damn
So i give up math.
Wow
Depois dizem que matematica não é divertido kkkkkk
YES!!!
Wow this was made 44 minutes ago this is the only time im early to my favorite creators video
I can only say that those who know and understand mathematics will enjoy this video more than those (including me) who know only the basics, great video you have made Alan, very Beautiful.
I want a calculator animated like that
what did i just see? i have no words
This is so cool I think I'm starting to like math
Matematika mudah dan menyenangkan bukan?   Bukan!!
a lot of windows calculator went into this
💯 15+15=30
Enjoyed the animation but I realized I'll be having to learn all abt this soon 💀
I think this videk making me more understand about mah
Безумно круто 🤩🤩🤩 Но не понятно :_)
Mad mathematics in life is going hard in years learning more about mathematics
Didn't know that math can be so amazing and cool.😎
My head in math class be like:
Wow. Just wow
I just love how the music starts growing more intense as the video progresses, especially how just a simple single number 1 can expand to such beautiful, glorious chaos.
I always knew math was dangerous
Have a good night
these calculations are easy, but I want to see you know... 2 + 2
hehe maf
only alan can math look really fun
1+1+1+1=8 easy
I would absolutely love to see a series of this!!
2+2=5
Seasonn 2!!!
I'm kind early
Never ever in my life, I thought I would enjoy a video about math
Epico😎👍
i think my brain exploded and now all i see is the darkness. too much math for my small brain
Part 2
if you dumb in this test 1-1=8
Ricky and Morty? We can explore the altern universe?
epic vid.
0 / 0 :D
This is just beautiful
даже захотелось выучить математику.
disclaimer: calculators were harmed in the production of this video
Can someone tell me what is the giant N at the end?
If yellow was in the video instead of orange the video would be much shorter.
This is the nerdiest animation ever
Hi
animation wins
Beautiful sorry and beautiful battle
Oh yeah that was just algrebra...
WOW your animation is MUCH smoother
The music behind feels like star wars.
1+1=3
I cant believe this came from 1+1
Orange was straight up destroying math, it's almost like he's lost his son to math or something
I hope there is a reaction from the mathematicians watching the video lol
Yes
number lore:
i finally understand why it is called “the most beautiful equation” thanks to alan becker and his team!
1+1=5
how do you make A GOOD QUALITY MATH VIDEO?
9 + 10 = 21
e turns into Sigma
les pesento al unico pibe que me encantaria que fuera mi profe de mate XD
I love the sound effects
Can you make one of them going though cartons like spongebob, Scooby-Doo, Bluey and etc😊
An animation of my favorite subject. Thanks alan :)
I hate math soooo much, its hard
The most insane way to learn maths. I love it.
Wkwkwk yang Indonesia absen  Ama like nya  ↓
👌 1;+)
Just woke up and saw this video! Thanks so much Alan Becker for doing my homework!
Everyone knows 2+2=5
Aw man, this is awesome!  Honestly, this is a great way of showing how interesting imaginary numbers are!
This is the way to teach math in schools
So glad I studied math all up to differential equations to understand all that(yes I love math so... Don't bother me)
MATH???
This video is unrivaled this is the best video in the series.
Babe wake up new alan Becker video just dropped
😮
Marvel is asking for your number
man cant wait for animation vs chemistry
IT WAS A JUST A FILLER!!!
No matter who or what they are, The Second Coming has always managed to make some friends after some godly battle lol
Animation is stuck in the calculator)
💀
next movie: Animation vs. English
Me in the math class
math gameplay vs math lore
Ok Alan u don't have to flex your A+plus math to us like that I don't understand everything 😂
MY BRAIN HURTS
This just blow my mind and want to study math even more
This is so cool!
How to get interested in math: Let alan be the teacher and make this masterpiece
This is the most badass animation ever that is about math.
Get your here early tickets here! 👇
This dude made math easier and fun for other people
This video that he made could contain mathematics that maybe humans couldn't find and maybe shouldn't
"when will i ever need to know how to do math?"
This made me learn and understand math more than my school in a month
the fact that he all did this correct step by step is so insane, even the animation is
This taught me mathematics better than my teachers
we need a whole series of this.
The way math was reprisented visually was already entertaining enough, most channels don't even make math look THIS interesting
He turned stick to Indian!
That’s Star Wars In Another Dimension
Alan is the type of guy that can make animation about anything and make it intresting to watch.
Why when orange, which makes the square root by 2 and where there should be 24 places for a four, was replaced by a three.
The+end
Bro took 20:00 minute to learn math yet humans take almost 15 years
2×2=4
i  didnt understand anything
Before I watch this video in it's entirety I think tsc is dreaming
77 + 33?
Hasta con números hace peleas épicas
Cool
POV: You are trying to figure out the math exam
how the dyslexic views maths
Pov:if math was a game
HE EVEN MAKES MATH SUPER FUN SHEEESH.. it made feel like I was watching a kurzgesagt wideo lol
Starts math be like
Many people are watching math video for first time
Meth lore
Damm
101
Also , Swapping 2 or More Digits : 1 swapped 1 = 11 11 swapped 11 = 1,111 There.
Animation vs  gravity next?
How to solve integral calculus:
Do part 2 and prank them don't worry if is bad
Que padre te salió la ando macion me encanto
Very well done!
Honestly I’m not even surprised he can make a awesome animation of math
This made my confidence more because I saw what math will do in our fight AM READY FOR THE FIGHT IN THE FUTURE!!!
This is what Math is in battle form and animation form
Thats so cool! 😂🎉❤
Idk why,  but I feel like yellow would have alot of fun in this world with math
imagine if he figured out how to divide 0 by 0 and reset the whole universe
I really enjoyed this animation. Great job!
The only thing that i understand is that i don't understand most used formula... 😵😵😵
1+1 is 4
This was such an amazing way to represent math
Matemática matemática!!!!!:mart Mart!!!!
The best animation I've ever watched
didn't even think that math can go fantastic like this
OH
Was waiting for log to come and beat the ass of e tbh
AAYY MATH! Your here with another masterpiece
Dang i missed it
It's crazy that the equations used are actually ligit🔥
literally me vs math on an exam
this vid make me get A+ on my math exam
Next video idea: Animation vs Meth
wait what
Remember baby, e = mc^2
тнιѕ нαѕ αℓαη вє¢кєя σяαηgє нαѕ ѕιмρℓє мαтнѕ

Вот где мне пригодилась математика
This was cute
I'm sure kids will get interested in math if teachers show this to them in the class
My brain in math:
Only Alan can make perfect videos❤❤❤
א
When teachers said math will save your life I didn’t think they meant by this way
I will learn from this video XD
i understood NOTHING about the math
Is nobody going to talk about how tsc Recreated King mango attack from avm
If TSC could Use them Against Other stickmen in other videos tho
1+1+1+1+1=0 Only the smartest can solve the problem.
Top people to get some help from in Maths: 1) Alan Becker 2) Indian teachers from Youtube 3) Teachers at school
13:33 i was ready to grab my shotgun once i saw that symbol  For those who don't understand, I meant the Zeta symbol, it is a symbol of a sexuality flag, belonging to people who have "relationships" with animals
After these equations and others add math skill, my brain cell just exploded about 80%
Dang if only the math lessons is this fun I wouldn’t sleep in em all the time
Beautiful animation❤❤❤❤❤
Les gooo
1+1=м 7+7=triangle 2+2=fish
Great vid by the way!!
Long timee.. Finally New Video Uploaded 🎉
I loved it
why do i understand math?
Hello Alan becker! I, love your videos ❤️
Meth
lol😂😂😂😂😂😂
Alan Becker's videos seriously never get old. There's just something about them that just reels you in and you can't stop watching until the very end. The sound effects, the music, the visuals, his videos never lose their touch and on top of that, they are original and are so fun to watch. It felt like Orange was like a pioneer of mathematics or he was trying to fight toward finding the solution to his problem (escaping the place he was trapped in). Looking forward to the next upload!
9:45 transformers lol
this video shows us how school math must look like
I love how this stickman is smarter than me in a couple of minutes even if it takes decades for me to understand it :)
1. 1 bb
the only way to make math fun is making it fight brilliant
Math teacher: hmm, omoshiroi, maybe you make a movie film theme "math"
therapist: so how do you describe maths? high school and college:
This is amazing, incredible.  This is art and alan is a GOD of art
Bro is teaching me better than the actual teacher
He's back?
Pov: When that math kid gets bored.
wheres the rest of the bois
I Just Let A Math : 1 - 1 = 0 A Multiple Servers : 3 × 111 + 455 - 56 + 8 + 8 ÷ 589 ÷ 3 = 0.423316355 And That's Why/How.
What just happened
Why were letters involved with math?
This is why i hate math
Orange's/TSC's brain after this vid:🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
it is too hard for my brain
We need part 2❤
i love how alan can make something u learn at school fun yet also show you how all of math stems from just the number 1 and 468 symblols
bro, i feel exicted watch this  math video 😲😲😲
The best math class ❤   Now I know how to use it, thank you
Bruh I don’t understand anything but that’s just cool
matematik dersinde uyuya kalınca gördüğüm rüya
He has posted which would equal me instantly klicking
Orange is going to be smart after this 😂😂
WE NEED MOREEE
math nerds be like “YOO THIS THE BIGGEST CROSSOVER EVER, THEY GOT POLYNOMIALS AND INTEGRATION”
Holy battle
1+1=5
I think it is better to learn math this way.
Is this a part of the story? Like they were experimenting on how a hole head stickman would react and improvise being trapped in a world of numbers.  Like the stick scientists are studying their methods and personality and making counters to them.   Also will the Dark Lord come back? He can't change a leaf and become a good guy because he's the dark Lord so he's surely still evil, unless TSC rewrites his code and name, which would be a great plot point.    The typical villain goal is to take over or destroy the world, it depends on how it's done. They stopped TDL from destroying the internet, they couldn't stop the king from destroying Minecraft but he changed at the last second. I can only guess that Victim will probably put TCO's code into himself, then killing TCO in front of TSC which would enrage TSC and bring out his powers, meanwhile the other four are fighting against the three mercenaries. So it's like the ultimate weapon, or maybe it's something else.
I can't even begin to understand the lore of this video
I don't know how TSC ended up in this dimension of math, but he should have been there with our little stickman head user genius Yellow. He would love to explore this world of mathematical principles and combinations of numbers, that would be adorable to watch, because he would be very excited. This is just my headcanon, btw I think it's not far from the canon.
It's probably in the laboratory
bro, the part where they found the radius of the circle was my favorite! no but srsly that was an epic anim
So Alan Becker was a secret mathematician This was also harder than pre-calculus 💀
Only Alan can make a 14 min animation about maths that only albert einstein can understand
I didn't understand anything, but if I make this account, will there be this battle?
Who knew math could be so violent
Wanted????😕😥😡😭
What if this was a simulation the the victim put tsc in so he could be studied and tested?
This brought back memories of high school that I didn’t want reawakened but it was still awesome none the less
Math is ez              To make somebody crazy 💀
Perhaps in the feature there could be a programming related one too? He first starts with "0" and an "or" gate. make that into a "CPU" that to "ASM" that to "C" that to "Linux Kernel" and from the internet in linux he can travel back to his home! All of the following projects mentioned are open source!
*What the dyslexic kid thinks in math class:*
Alan did a better job at explaining math than all of my previous math teachers
The sound designs gonna make me crean
My barin hurts
ok if math was like this irl i would like it more
You perfectly expressed how I felt in my college math classes. _"Why are all the numbers attacking me?!"_
This was so unique.   As an engineering student, I can understand MOST of these concepts, but not all. Incredible creativity on how to make math into a LITERAL weapon!
Alan you are straight up a animating king this is amazing well done bro love everything about this keep it up
And i thought my teacher was good
Bro eres increíble
When’s next animator vs animation
7:05 Voltage and current in phase.
And 2+2=22
Good video
You take the blue pill you return back to Wonderland you take the red pill and you see how deep the matrix really goes 12:23
1+1=2
9+10=21
wait what was that giant symbol at the end, i can't see it properly
"The math test isn't that hard" The math test:
mafs.
Hi
I will be smartest kid on math class after watching this 💀
wow I dont even know maths lmao my math sucs xD
I didn't understand anything, but it was amazing
Ah yes math
WHAT THE HELL💀🇺🇸
1+1 is cannot be
I think this video blow up my tire brain and brain cell at the same time😱🤯
Мне понравилось
it's so cool that you get dizzy looking at it 😣😆
1+1 = 11 gang   🔽
Can you do animations VS languages?
That's why i love math
cool
Pin Me!
Dam no wonder math stands for mental abuse to humans
This animation vs math video by Alan Becker blows my mind with how well math can be constructed and simulated, I watched the whole thing without skipping because of the math battles. Genuinely a very well thought out animation.
THIS IS NOW MY NUMBER ONE FAVORITE VIDEO ON THIS CHANNEL!!!!!
e
This one has to be my fav
E
"Your math is no match for me you fool"  "Math sword"
Imagine TSC using the Calculator vs. Victim using Photoshop
See this is why I hate math. Fully answered for me
is nobody questioning how TSC ended up in the void with a bunch of numbers? Is this the calculator app or something?
Animations vs anime
Это чтото сверх гениальное и связанное с математикой. Я думаю меня бы так уничтожила матиматичка если бы мир позволил
2+2=5
We would like to thank Alan Becker and her team for making even math fun
Math is not that hard. Math :  Bro, this is amazing. But i don't understand, lol.
bro alan becker just reminded me my grade 2-3 math lessons       ALSO GOD DAMN ALAN YOU MADE EVERYONE LEARN MATH
where does this one tie into the acu
lovely
The math is power,literal.
this is crazy
I love this episode. Please do something similar with physics and chemistry formulas and reactions etc
As a person who just lives in mathematics , I can say that what Alan did is just incredible
I like math after watched this video. although, I don't like studying math.
Get your before an hour award here🎉🎊🎉   👇
que porra é essa?
Ура, я умнее компьютера!
꽤 참신한 동엉상이군요.
Even a stick figure can draw a perfect then most of us here
Does anyone else agree with me when I say that this is Alan flexing is math skill to us 😭
Cool
Wer is infinity
Does any one know what happened
I like how Alan made math look boring but then when you watch the video it gets more cooler
Just as confusing as it was in school.
Who knew Math could be fun...
I'm good at math but, WHAT THE HELL IS THIS
Its amazing. No commentaries.
Автор гений за 12 минут объяснил тему 11 класов
Can you do chemistry or physics in the next video.
Pov: Alan doesn't know who to face animations anymore
1+1=5
wow
Me saludas
"Work Smarter Not Harder"
This is so cool math
i just wanna say, that this has so much potential to be a game...
Man finally another upload
My brain:fu#$ this sh/t
as an engineering student, i can proudly say i know most of it.
Aku baru tahu kalau matematika itu bisa menjadi senjata yang kuat
That is masterpiece🔥🔥
I swear I'm shit at math💀
Hello i'm speek spain
guys this is the real way of how to do math
"You can't just make math look cool!" *Alan Becker:*
i feel like i just gained 100 braincells from watching this
Wanted ep2 pls
when wanted eps 2
1+1=11 raight
Math
The Second one is Smart Stickman🧡😎
🎉
My brain is broken
These animations are the best but now 2 + 2 is 22
my brain oh my god... but good job !
Get your within  hour ticket here!        👇(sorry if. i couldnt show the like button correct place)
The second coming turn big brain mode
Now i understand math
idea so creative i love the animation, worth the time offline
does he use this knowledge against persecutors?
Math is insane, when stick figures have arrived to make some fun out of it
This fight is awesome man. But the infinity too gets stronger It's durability and damage
They quite literally solved the problem
i am so confused
Everyone knows 1-1 is a tie.
i was expecting 1+1=2 --> 1+(1+2) --> 1+1+(2+3) fibbonaci sequence that would be so cool
То было просто супер 👍
Sedang memahami
sans v8
Alan Becker just made animation vs math and the comments say everyone know 1+1 = 11 That not me
6+6 is 66 guys!
This was weird in a good way. Enjoyed it very much
POV: your learning math by Just watching this video
3:17 bro showed us 4th dimension
90÷45=999,999,99,9 #
1+1=M
I think whoever did this made him end up in someone's calculator but who would do that?  wait.....THE VICTIM.
you NEED to make more episodes
9:16 WE NEED THE INFINITY TAN GUN
10:29
Greatest video ever
Alef??? 13:46
This video taught me more than actual math class
Man calculator 2 looking crazy. Can't wait for open beta.
11:06 mf just pulled mathematic beam on a robotic math man
Yooo this is my type of video
KAMEHAMEHAAA LASER
Can someone explain to me the ending?
Алан Беккер гений, с помощью этого видео даже можно научится математике🤯🤯
Это просто ГЕНИАЛЬНО!!!
Its official: Math is action packed and intense!
matematik mengubah segalanya lol
QUE FODAAAAAAA
this is a א behind fom israel?
10:30  EXCUSE MY LANGUAGE BUT DID ORANGE JUST MAKE A FUCKING MATH RAILGUN?!
this is better math than school math
I need part two
عرب؟
Orange really just went to war with a bunch of mathematical symbols...
Espere mucho tiempo por este video!! Los trabajos que alam hace son increibles y por el es que quiero ser animadora!
Second coming you so smart😅
e
why did you put here the word "א" in hebrew
TCO before math: Eh  TCO after Math: Genius 1000%
Yet another masterpiece Alan, keep it up. I can't wait to see what's up ahead.
OMG my brain like puffffff... 🤯🤯🤯
❤❤
Im still im the 6th grade so idk what the fuck is happening
No ithis 2
It's literally me in institute.
Now I actually want all five stick figures fight each other in the graph world.
*muth*
TSC fucking died
Need a part 2 of this..
I sort of want to study maths now all of a sudden
what
Everybody and thing knows that 1+1 equals 11.1111111
S I C K
Did... math just become cool?
Bro, think of a better video than this one, it doesn't have the support of Alan and the best animator in the world, his creativity and beyond ours he manages to make the effects, sounds and animation. congratulations
???
How'd you make math epic?
okay this animation is amazing but a full thorough explanation is required
Bro really teached us math.
OMG
Now this is how teachers should teach maths
i like his bow is literally 2×2= and arrows are 4 :D
orange just learning too many maths 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
TSC is smort 🤓
What dose this all mean, is this lore?
mf i cant understand maths💀
A stick figure learn more math most faster and easily than me!!!
If they used this video to explain math in schools, kids would beaver to do trigonometry by 4th grade. Once “animation vs languages”, “animation vs science”, and “animation vs all of history” come out, grade school will no longer be needed!
1+1= BIGGER 1          ~Supreme Leader
i have never heard a "math sound" before and never expected to hear one but here we are
pov: the chosen one learns math gone wrong
Este hombre me llena de orgullo hace las mejores animaciónes
I wish school taught us math like this 😭
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO ABOUT MATH I EVER SEEN>:D
1+1=田
This is the true avm short
It looks so good
4:51 the math sword
College-level understanding of math here, and the only thing I so "cleverly" noticed is that the "e" is simply a value made up causing errors in the system that can simply derive from itself causing infinite outcomes leading to how "e" which is a simple symbol (just like the others) given a value my humans which also created the mathematical system leading to the ability to transport orange to a different realm.  Really wanted to create a discussion here, I don't even get most of the math and that makes me sad :(
1+2=3-6=-3
This is how school should teach kids
Me in math class(I’m planning the end of Georgia)
If math class was like this, I would learn absolutely nothing but I would be thoroughly engaged
Pure masterpiece of math, i'm sure great mathematician from the past will be happy that what they found out is actually being in an animation and is watched by millions of people
Speed this up x5 put some music under it and you got a math lore meme
w polsce jest ponad 12lat nauki a alan te 12lat podsumował w 14minutach
Hey axolotl what is 10+11 It’s 46
I love it when TSC is getting hold hostage by a literal subject.
My brain😵😵
It all started in just 1 number
e¡
I suck at math, who can explain me what just happened
What.the.
TSC knows math! Maybe tsc will teach there friends how to learn math?
Fun fact: this comment is made less than a hour and you wasted your time reading this comment
WOW😮
i have no idea what happened but it was cool
starting from 1+1
is good
que bom que fiz faculdade, entendi todos os cálculos kkkkkk
My dude is learning math ngl😊
5+skickman=🔥🔥vid
Waiting for when there will be Ediths about mathematics
Вот такой математикой я бы позанимался.
bro made even math onto weapons 💀
Alan Becker you are the best at animations W Alan
My average math lesson: battle math
Bro is investing in orange to make him much more powerful  Look at him doing all that math stuff and then gets to learn how to open a portal
NOW THIS IS HOW MATH SHOULD BE TAUGHT.
Math can hurt the mind, it can also hurt your body by throwing math at you
This is pure genius
Imagine if goes quantum physics and relativity next
This was a masterpiece,you never fail to amaze us Alan,keep up the good work 👍
1+1=2
I fell asleep in math class My dream:
I feel bad for the maths haters
Math lore
38 minutes late...
this makes me want to do math
Bro had to insane maths on this like IfInitey e pie etc
38min
No....math can't be....math + fun = impossible .... HOW COULD IT BE?! He made it possible.
天才の発想
Yes yes yes
alan made me do a learn
What
OMG BRO THAT WAS SO GOOD WHOEVER IS MAKING THESE ANIMATIONS NEEDS TO MAKE A GAME NOW
This is overall amazing. I may not have an understanding of math that good, but I understand that this quality is through the roof.
Sc Is Better Than My Math Teacher
Scrolling through the comments and not even a single math lore comment
So cool, man
Matematik sınavında düşündüğüm
I am sad because there is just the second coming
a entire species themed on math has gotten me interested, hope they return for another video
Better explained then my entire math class
My brain had gone numb after this video😂
therapist: all dreams have meaning my dreams:
The second person other than my math teacher that got me into a math video
animation vs element pls 👇
You start a animation vs puzzle seris
My brain..
if math was that cool id be a mathematician
Although it's kinda confusing about the story.. How he meet that math.... It's still cool
eiπ
so cool
This is probably the most fantastic video Alan has ever made and its about math.. the thing you mostly forget after high school
It gets like a thousand times better when you understand what's actually going on.
Me know 37 minutes of this f### video
If math like this i'll be genius
holy crap
Teacher vs smart kid be like
Second coming’s Asian confirm
wow
Ok what I learned from this video is about maths thank you Alan for teaching me
Even the Characters don't Speak we still understand what they mean! Nicee
My math teacher will probably watch this a thousand times, no wait a million times
Welcome to  -mental -abuse -to -humans
2:56 i would expect any chaos about dividing to zero
1+1=3
math madical
1 + 1 is always just a bigger 1
This channel has some of the most creative animation I’ve ever seen. Amazing sound design too!
"Years of learning at the university, went to waste"
What a legendary f(x) gun it is🙊
Not event the math universe was able to destroy orange
My life 360 bc of math
I was doing well till I got to the geometry section
Animation vs the alphabet lol😂
And thats how TSC becomes the best smarter of the stick figures!
P
The animation is Mathematically satisfying
Bro my head hurts
Cant believe i fell in lovr with matj
Now I know what Einstein meant
Imagine how powerful Tsc would be if he can access to this power in the main episodes
imagine if a stickman is better that you at doing math
Probably  the best video so far
We all know Alan was using a calculator at least once.
Well this can teach people about Math
never have i ever seen math been used in such a fun, creative and amazing way. i dont know much about maths but i slightly get whats going on and its awesome to just see how everything works and just the idea of alan knowing what hes doing shows how smart of a man he is (if he got help then hes still smart to me)
That's it, I'm showing this to my math teacher, and if she doesn't play it in class next time, I'm gonna be really pissed...
He learning math
Tsc becomes super smart in few minutes💀💀
I thought i was a professional math person, but this is next level.
12:26 the way he wrote the word “exiT” was really clever
If only I payed more attention in math class
30min😊
Orange really completed an entire 'advanced physics and maths' exam in only 14 minutes
bro could make a video even about the most boring subject, yet he still makes it so goddamn interesting and cool, you have an incredible talent alan
I late 37 min..💀
Alan Becker's animation is the best, because of the interesting storyline and smooth animation. Keep it up and I will continue to support you.
i guess you can say that was a math problem.
1:49 Careful now, he just became imaginary.
I truly am at a lost for words
Make animation vs people playground please make it 😢
Be nice to e :(
สวัสดีครับท่านอลัน 1+1คือ3
I know I’d lose that fight
It boss fight
I LOVE THIS
My brain gg
Albert Einstein lore
Bro taught the whole world geometry physics and science💀
This is my brain during my maths test
Grande Alan becker haciendo un video de matemáticas el cual es entretenido epico y que no entiendo todo, lo cual me provoca curiosidad y ganas de aprender matemáticas......
AMAZING!
pensé que usaría el divido cero en el final de la batalla
win math
That was amazing
That is pure genius😍 So much talent
The second coming is just so good at fighting that he uses maths as an weapon. And he nailed it!
Me, crossing hands: NIIIIIIIIIIICE!
I have _zero_ clue as to what it is I just watched... but it was utterly fantastic.
Who Say the math are bot fun😊❤te quiero mucho alan en español
What an amazing animation you did. Every animation you did is better than the last one. Continue in that way. 👌👍
самое то перед егэ по матеше
This is the most fun I’ve had with math all year.
You know the "when my mom comes in my room when watching a video" meme? Well that happens to me, but they thought I was actually becoming more mature cuz it's an animation about math...
Bruh everybody knows math 🌚+💡=?
We Need A Part 1+1
Wow
Everybody gangsta till the teachers show this video in class
matematika ilmu yang mematikan 🗿
Bro made math fun.
you dont need to hide you hate math alan jokes aside this is an amazing video!
I just learned more math here then school
this brings back so many memories
Now you show how math is cool in practice  Not in theory
there has to be a part 2, what was that thing at the end?????
Alan will win the prize as the best math teacher of the year
This sh boutta be fire i know it
🤯🤯🤯🤯😵‍💫
Awesome! 🤩😆
Time to be confused... because im dumb, and not because I dont know what the characters are trying to do.
That was amazing! Shout-out to the sound design too 👀
IS THAT A NEW AV(place your letter) SEASON????
I understand the reference        Until the started using imaginary numbers
Me when get bored in math class
What does that ei pi mean?
Alan isn’t pregnant,but he always delivers.
Alan, I having troble on my math. Can you help me😢
He's gonna be a major ally, Soon.
Wish maths could be done like this...
My brain during classes:
My brain wasn't braining while watching
one day i will be like you
응애
Math win
That's make my brain 💥 what the h.... I have see  on this video he named bottom of the math
that is SO cool the animations of the decomposition of formulas are so smooth
4:41 TSC: PREACH TO GOD YOU DEMON!
Alan please make a sequel of this it was like an unfinished excitement episode we didn't even see it reach pc
No 1+1=  y=1 x=-1 z=1
Absolutely beautiful. This portrays the beauty and wonder of mathematics so well, as a math student it really touched me. Maths is truly mysterious and it is the language of this universe!!
Finally a fun way to learn math
Almost everyone watching this video probably has no idea what an orange means.
21
if this makes a game its will be the best math game ever
Well I’m half impressed
This reminds me of that one Looney Tunes show where a little boy likes to daydream about all kinds of things he sees around him.
This video taught me more maths then my math teachers has ever done💀
Bro thinks he’s in the matrix
The moment when you realise AvA could have a maths part with a table calculating program, because THIS WAS AWESOME  Great job done
Math teacher secret power:
let's learning math with TSC
Next episode: Set theory, the barber's paradox, and *recursion*
I stopped understanding the math halfway through but it was still amazing
I swear, this man never runs out of ideas
what
2
Far more entertaining than I thought this was gonna be 🤣
"Matematika itu mudah dan menyenangkan bukan?" "Bukan!!"
omg
This video made me more interested in math than school
My head is know to 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 my head learn form game.
🤯
This is start from ”1”
You can’t convince me to do math
高1わい、4分辺りから分からなくなってきた
ALAN GREAT VID KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
English and social studies  trash
but wtf is a square root anyway
King alan becker
Orange get good in math within 15 minutes, and it is better than me working my whole life, LMAO
So basically, Animation vs 3Blue1Brown
After watching the vid, I don't think math is that boring anymore
sheesh,
Math
I don't understand where is red blue green and yellow?
MAF SUK
I wish that maths subject would be like this......
Wow 😧😧😧
hi
this is a amazing way to visualize math.
bro is smarter than me at anything
The most difficult match up so far.
i have no brain now
He made math look so fun
wow  i always love it
Cant even be jenius without called nerd in gen z 😫🤮
Today was ok... but _then_ Alan Becker uploaded and took my day to an 11/10... nothing else even happened yet, but whatever happens, I started my day off right!
Is it just me or why does TSC look a little. Taller?
Everyone knows 1+1=2🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think this is the hardest video alan has ever mde
Also is this canon???????? WE NEED AVAIV EP 2 PLZ
OMG
א?
"You stupid"  "No im not" "Whats 9+10" "21" "Yo stupid"
im saying it you probally learned more about math from this video then from school.
Plot twist: He fell asleep in the calculator app
best video i have ever watched
Math and science ante the best subjects
kinda funny how the e^i pi goes into the dimension of imaginary numbers lol
This is fun learning
I never thinked that math would be cool, but you show to us that math can be cool with your animation. And with this video I know now that 2+2= 5
обьяснили всю математику в одном видео с экшеном.))) однозначно +))))
,2
part 2 ?
7+11-7 eleven
I feel like not enough ppl talk about how equally amazing the sound design is in your guys' work
Honestly i like episodes like this as a break from the 'main storyline', a return to formula of just having stickfigures mess up things they shouldn't have access too is just such a cool concept outside of the usual 'stick with superpowers'
Alan Is the only man that can have you at the edge of your seat with math
He did it, he learnt math
did i actually watched a video about school stuff for 15 minutes during summer break and likes it?
Bro solved my t homework💀
I hope some maths teachers play this for their students to show the potential of what they're learning
Alan Becker Presents: Animation Meet Equestria Girls (Official Video)
Alan just made math better and entertaining
S
❤❤❤
most exciting math ever
Learn't more than Matt's class😅
this uploaded while I had math tuition 🗿
Holy crap im freking out
SO GOOD
Will the next one be animation vs music?
Everyone know 1+1 is 11 because no equal
The "e" reminds me of the Clippy of AVA3
PURR-FECTION!!
Yall remeber when the chosen one  was running around wildin
My brain after this ☠️  My brain Couldn't handle the math and how The Second Coming Got Here
Wow Alan... just wow, this is so AMAZING!! I LOVE IT!❤❤❤  Someone should make a marvel character with math powers lol
Heh 1+1 is 21 thogh😊
The way that these characters interact with the digital world around them never fails to amaze me . The action is always creative !
2:48- *Oh no.*
I WANNA SHOW THIS TO MY MATH TEACHER
*Fans:* Does your creativity have limits? *Alan’s Creativity:* tbh I don’t kno-
My brain 🧠 lag😢
I dare anyone on this planet to make maths more interesting
That is cool!
Bro's about to make the longest number
I'm all confused about the math stuff after the times tables, but regardless the animation made me stay.
Bro 1+1 = 11 not 2 👀
Man i love all the animations you do, you are an inspiration for me 🔥🔥
masterpiece
What can I say except…                                  Masterpiece.
Big Math Brain
Goofy ahh subject
this video shows my brain during an exam.
bro the + end

If only math was this much fun
SC learned literally nearly everything about math in under 14 minutes than a person within 10 to 20 years; goddamn
nerd
スティックマンでも数は倒せないのさ😂
Only alan can make math fun to watch
0.1x10²
Les go, new Alan Becker video!🔥🔥🔥🔥 Oh wait its math nvm...
This video only genius can understand the meaning of this video And if u can not understand it, this animation will be can you're platform to study more math Truly *MASTERPIECE*
bros doing calculus. 💀  edit: 11:00 i thus call this weapon...THE MAINFRAME CANNON!  edit 2: we need math vs orange king!
Espero que esto vuele el internet. Eres un genio Alan.
Second me adelantaste en la escuela
You know when he uploads a video, it’s an Golden Animation
never thought I'd see the day where stickfigures are relatable
This aint math this is meth
1+1=2 31 minutes ago)
wow can i use this video for teaching?
This is math?
Math is my nightmare 😱😱😱😱😱😱
My brain is dead of thinking
i wish schools tought us math like this

Thanks for the tutorial
4,234th (the fog is coming)
Ah yes, the new AVM
It was like I was seeing transformers in a mirror dimension. Very cool!!!
as I'm not good at math, my brain has been exploded
Did he just make the death star
the math war 1
Yooo I'm finnaly early to these stuff
hi
I am waiting for it too long . And finally
Please a breakdown of everything math related !
😍😎😎😎yeaaaaassss i love these guys and the animation woohoooo And whoa thisbis what i learned in grade 7 he seems like a smart guy idk how to even do when im in that void i have many things to learn in math. Lol
He leaned so many things today unlike me tho
STICK FIGURE FINDS A NUMBER; THE WHOLE WORLD IS NOW AT WAR.
NOOOPE we are stopping at trig. Wait does that mean well get logs..... were definitely getting logs....
THIS IS COMPLETELY EXPLODED MY BRAIN THIS IS PERFECT
man i'll never understand math good job little stick figure
My brain😵
1+1 is 3
No he entendido nada a partir de que salga la e esa rara
LOL 1+1=11
Bro everyone knows 1+1 is obviously 1 cuz if u have one drop of water and add another drop of water u have 1 big drop
Math with my teachers: *sleeps*  Math with stickmans: interesting🗿
1+1=0
Part twoooooo
So… what does e to the power of i “Pi” mean
This video completely say that math is truly a beautiful and a powerful piece in our life. Thank you, Alan Becker!
hi
This man was able to make an epic fight out of mathematics, my respect
oh my god stickman is a genius
Claim your ticked before 1 hour!
Great video ax always, I love how you can't tell what the characters are thinking even though they can't talk. Suprising how math can be so interesting when played with and manipulated liek this.
I'd rather call this Animation vs. Euler's identity. Math is not just that simple
Great animation alan keep it up
wow
omg my fav ytber has finaly uploaded something
Second coming where going
10-1= 8
As a person who loves math, I actually am impressed! Not just of the animation, but of the educational basis here!
Meth is too hard 😢
I love soundtrack in this video. Animation also looks amazing!
This video is pure gold
Feastables
My beans is destroy
M.A.T.H = Mega Anticlimatic Torture H
Alan is a smart man.
Math is genuinly a beautiful thing but school made it fucking awful! Learning math by myself really opened my eyes
1+1=22
The best math action movie I've seen
Yes
This video is absolutely random
Ah yes 1=1 truly amazing
No no no not the + end we NEED more parts of this ASAP
Math
Test:what is 4+4  My brain:
As animações desse cara são outro nível cara insano
SC finds the calculator app
How did yellow stickman become smart
Okay I'm gonna be watching this video a lot.
This is the math version of dark souls
i have no idea what is going on
YES MORE VIDEOS
2+2=🥔
I don't understand 😅
I understand about 75% having taken pre calculus the previous year. Though when we get to imaginary numbers that’s were calculus tends to help.
I love it❤😂
ok my brain hurt tryna process what happenings
Cool! (As always)
Best way to make your kids learn math:
6÷0=0
Bro literally explain my homework💀
Omg that so cool
bro 2
THIS IS SO MUCH MATH O-O
1 + 1 = 2 10M people that are about to view this: *INTERESTING*
THE+END=EP²
1+1=5
Everything started with a simple 1
So cool! My head Hurt!
Math
Math is not boring
if Math was actually good
Good animation, but what’s happened
Wow this animation was cool
Учим математику с оранжевым
e?
no! part 2 is coming...
سلام عليكم
No way this is look like spme kind of learning with stick man
무슨 엄청난 계산기 프로그램 같음 ㅋㅋㅋ
next animation vs astronomy please
Bro this guy is teaching me math :/
10:35 he just starts orbital striking them 😂
Teachers should learn from here how to make math more interesting to students
Heh maths is fun when Alan Becker teaches it
Alan, I wonder what this means if you're proving that our lives go by fast and that of course one day math is a fun lesson, I already knew
who needs school when we have Alan Becker
Math arc
the power of math is far greater then any weapon. that's why no one can truely master it
The only time were math is not boring,lol
Hebat
this was good revision for my math skills
This is amazing, all the maths satisfied me so much!
This battle is called when my math teacher is in the void when class starts
bro actually made me learn something
я никогда не думала, что математика может быть динамической. я ошибалась.
Este hombre es un genio
א looks like a menace
great animation!
:o aleph
Aprendí más de lo que sé de mate con este video.
You are a legend
Can you make the e symbon a cannon character please
You know what would be cool if Alan Becker and his stick figures were to ever do a crossover with another animated YouTuber like element animation, the odd1sout or mike salcedo (The guy who created alphabet lore) Alan if you see this I hope it gives you an idea
DO you guys imagine if it was yellow instead of orange
I love your vids❤️🥰
i'm not a math nerd so i have no idea what's happening, I'm just enjoying the stick man fighting the e.
Good nice ♡
the dedication
what?
Bro learned every formula of math In just a minute💀
only alan can make a math video so dramatic
I can already see now in the future a Animation vs Programming where they win by putting the program in a neverending while loop or something
5:33  bro made a perfect circle like it was nothing lmaoo
Cannot wait for a professor to drop a 2 hour explination of all the maths here.
I miss math😢 because my grade 12 subjects doesn't had math
this is top tier even tho i dont understand any of the math in the video
Finaly new seri
I am finally fast…❤😂
?: Что может быть страшного в математике? Я: эм..
i was late 32 mins
Orange noob 2:43
Now teach computer science like this!!!!!
Alan becker is the best
Now i know my Maths
Yuh
If there was a game exactly like this…
Vote for Minecraft vs animation series
1+1=11 oclock🙂
This is such a uniquely crafted masterpiece. Using math as pretty dope weapons gave me chills, such as that infinity gun thing, and the little details I understood, such as that when TSC divides 0 by 6, a ton of 0's appear, and when e^in and TSC swordfight with -1 and +1 respectively, they cancel out and 0's appear. That's a neat addition lol, and although I do not understand some of them, it's still amazing to see. Well done Alan. This is why you are still my favorite animator to this day
Woahhhhhh amazing!
W+O+A+H
10:57 bro had enough and made the ultimate math weapon to obliterate the monstrosity that e has created 💀
This video could let anyone learn maths so easily and become a master at it.
Anamaiter Vs Guns
א.
я вахере
That big fight scene is me vs all the math tests I have and instead of me winning it's me failing
:0
oh god it's getting smarter..
I love this video man,  Side note, You were the first to make me think how the volumes of spheres with radius √i in all even dimensions add up to -1.
1+1. O[--1
Ok how in the fresh hell did you make math look COOL?!
Only Alan Becker can show his improvement animation from the basic to the next level.
이사람 굉장해
i am in form 2 i don't know what he is doing
This is so cool it looks so clean and the sound effects work perfectly
Oh yea
Imagine Yellow was there
"1+1=?"   21?
alan the animation goat
This new Avengers trailer looks great
Vote for orange man
hacker be like😂
What was that ending? What was that stomping noise?
Siema mądra głowa jaka Izy liczba❤ 1+1=2😅
"isin"
Time is 8:32 pm
Alan is genuinely the most creative person on this platform
This video is the best this guy is the best animator
finally math
the story of these little men is moving before my eyes 🥲
Hi
THE - END = ?
Будет интересно посмгтреть это видео через пару лет, а то так не везде понятно
We'll all remember the time when orange became a god at every for of math within a few minutes
Aku Ra paham mtk
I should grab a paper to make notes
1:42 bro went from grade 1 math to high school math
Bros get to 7th grade in 14 minutes
Vote for Netflix show
I took me some time to realise that was Aleph in the background at the end. Hopefully we will see them again one day
oh man, i was in the live chat and oh boy wasn't it wild.. that was the wildest chat i've seen in my entire 7 years of youtube never have i seen a chat this crazy. people we're spamming so much stuff lmao, we all generally enjoyed it. everyone was nice and it was cool! i didn't expect this to be like a full fleshed movie. Bravo Alan well done, can't wait to see what you have in store for us in the future!
Orange's adventures in the numerical void.
This is one of the best video i saw from alan becker
1:39-So he just pushed the line into 1 and got euler's number^(i*pi)?! HOW?
My math teacher told me if you divide something with 0 you get imprisoned So is alan becker ok?
Got Me Like
When u show this to a nerd The Nerd: OMG IT'S MATH
Wait does this mean the event of animation vs math takes place where the second coming was capture along with the chosen one? Because he was alone there
He made the impossible of making math actually cool
bro really broke math 💀
This prove my opinion,math is an unique world that is perfect and cool
its a intresting
Someone should make a calculator like this
13:48 IS THAT ALEPH-0 LOGO!?!?  Btw, this is going to be a wonderful animation. This can teach some college students and maybe the teacher shows the animation to the college student to learn something new instead of just talking in whiteboard.
I am so darn good at math🤓
Hi
By far the most confusing thing I have ever watched, hopefully I learn this math when I go to college. Then I can rewatch this and understand everything. :)
Me relaxing once again, that I’m bad at math
It is surreal to watch this. Long before, i had an idea about something like "Math World" where everything is escaping guns that multiplies it's targets with 0. It was filled with many incredible stuff. I was getting tons of ideas (which i forgot now, sadly). I was like: "Why does nobody make this?!" And today, i can see this into action!    Edit: No '0=0' guns shooting '×' though. Getting there, i think.
So tsc tier is extra dimensional now?
* there is a new math teacher me: who is he? Principal: Alan Becker
bro 1+1 = 5 lol
Damn
This made me learn math bro and ALAN WAS COOKIN WITH THIS
something strange at 4:16, -exp(i.pi) should be equal to -cos(pi)-isin(pi) but sin(pi) = 0 so i don't know
Every time he interact with the math equation, i will uncontrollably say "HUH"
31 minutes ago and its already 186k views nice
The director must be a maths doctrate😮😮
I don't understand anything but this video is still good :)
W
What happened in the ending???
Wooooooow  Amaziiiiing 🤩 I can't say how is it incredible❤
TSC learns addition, then subtraction, multiplication, division, exponents, square root, imaginary numbers, trigonometry, integral, sigma notation
Mr figiting my calculator like a toy
This animation reminds me when chosen one fight with the clip from the old microsoft word
the sound design is crazy
This hurts my head but god it's so well put together
Man, if I had orange to help me with my math, I could’ve passed 😅
My calculator in my math exam 😅
It looks very nice.
I hate math but this video makes me like math、thank you
I have never learned math like this on my whole life 😏
Everyone gangsta till e do the RUSH E
4235 comment...
Just WOW 🤩🤩
oh
Sfxthgt
I'm pretty glad that I understand half of the videoo 😂
I'm pretty glad that I understand half of the videoo 😂
The One vs the 1. Their battle will be legendary!
HE IS LEARNING OMG
So good animation 😁👍👍
woah i like this animation math but Is there anything to shout out?
I am in a territory I do not understand but for some reason I’m really thinking about it
It was the most Mathematics animation I've ever seen. Wonderful
1+1=2
I think it should of ended with him coming out of the windows calculator. That would of made sense to me.
I have no idea what I just watched, but that was very cool
In this video, I traveled to an endless sea of ​​mathematics
Only Alan Becker can make an animation about math that we can enjoy
That is insane bro!
Alan just flexing his sound design at this point
This is best thing on internet alan
Meth or math? *choose.*
You need to make a animation vs chess vid . This one is cool
this vid looks like a movie lol ngl!
This is the best thing I have ever seen. And don't forget  i×i=-1😄
Turned math into a war…
😃 1+1 is 11 😒no 1+1  is 2😃
what the fuck?
I love it
1:55 bro went in the shadow realm (imaginary numbers reference)
How to learn math fast:
Alan's unlocking memories from school
I wish we could learn math like that
BROOOO I WANT PART TWO WITH ALEPH!!!!!!
Finally a youtuber that's good at math
Whats 9 + 10 Me:....    *21*
Mathematics = Entertainment. What a creativity ! Loved it. ❤️
That was so cool
Bro could’ve collaborated with 3b1b!!
How does this video have 4,200 comments when this video came out 29 minutes ago
Math teacher yesterday and tomorrow be like
everything is amazing about this, the sound design, the animations, the visualisations, the everything
Que vídeo lindo! Parabéns por expor um pouco de matemática para as pessoas, seu canal tem tanta visibilidade, e a matemática é tão presente e necessária. ps: o que aconte com e^ipi, derivação...
I hope SC's math intelligence will appear in the future animations.
No its 2
Math lore
Genius.
X t+1 = kxT (1-xT)
no
it’s fucking perfect and genius
Math is a Weapon They say
Imagine learning math in this video
._.
Please ep 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
Who remembers the old the chosen one days?
If someone asks me how i learned math before exams this is what i'll show em
A stickman is smarter than me
YOOOO 28 MINUTES AGOOOOOOOOOO LES GOOOOOOOOOOO
Alan's brain was definitely melting while trying to make this video
God this must have taken so long to animate. I can’t imagine having to script all the math bits
This is what happened on my mind
никогда не мог подумать,что математика такая эпичная
Not gonna lie but this feels like a video from 2093
I wouldn't be surprised if this was shown in a math class It's too good to not be shown
POV it’s 3am and you can’t sleep
this dude actually made math fun and intresting
Before I go study math u need to watch this to motivate u and everyone knows 1+1 is 3
Do animation vs physics/elements/science
My kids better watch ur videos...hella inspiring bro
1+1 It's 2 periods, yes it can be 11 or windows
Alan’s creativity is  ∞
Imagine this being a real game tho
Wow! This video is awesome!  Even the whole part before the crazy flight was already so fun and cool to watch. Amazing job man!
I DIDNT UNDERSTAND A SINGLE THING BUT STILL FIRE🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i love math now
Thanks to alan i want to learn math again
Wow! I wonder why he didn’t use group theory proof of e^(i*pi) = -1
❤❤
This video was the vision when creater of maths created maths.
Exactly i feel when i tried understanding math
Ahh this one was the most great though ;) Very sad it ended :(
God forbid if they saw letters and greek alphabet on their math
Wait,where's yellow,blue,red and green? It just tsc here,but where's everyone?  Why is tsc alone?
Everyone know 20+10=300
only Alan can make math cool also bro is Literally finding the answer to life
Masterpiece ❤
this video describes my math lessons perfectly
*Yo recomendando a mis compañeros el vídeo* Yo: y es por eso que las matemáticas enseñadas por palitos es god
alan becker made everyone watches math
If only math was actually this fun to learn😂
a
Pun: What do you call a bee that can’t make up its mind? A may-bee.🤣
auch my brain
OMG LOL DÍA
Damn Math is confusing
😵
Noice
**Me looking at the formula sheet**  Also my brain:
Me trying to make sense of every formula shown: 🗿
9+10
ah yes E the antagonist, and PIE the item of power
Топ
You made me understand math again
я сегодня узнал больше чем за 6 лет учебы
As a mathematician, I can confirm this is accurate.
lol
The second coming is getting really damn bored in that cage
Other title be like  Animation vs. Baldi’s basic   Lol
Can we all take a minute and appreciate the sound design here? It makes the action and visuals so much more enjoyable than they already are!
=D
Jeez bro elementary things
This is the math I wanna learn
i swear gen z will be smarter if he makes more of these
First
Kinda reminds me of assassination classroom.
No 1+1 is not 11 but is 2
Ansioso para vê com as outras matérias!!
Me during math class without my calculator:
So this is how mathematicians fight each other
Literally Matrix
I never interested in math that much before
You have just created an invaluable resource for math teachers worldwide
1:16
e.
Noice
this is cool
Animation vs history Animation vs anime Animation vs multiverse Animation vs irl Animation vs god of war Animation vs jesus Animation vs Germany Animation vs Roblox Animation vs Google Animation vs fnaf Animation vs ?????????????
Dude this teaches me more than my actual math teacher
This video explains all the things about math😁
*Alan Becker is now becoming famous as Alan Walker*                                                                                                     - CRYSTAL
Make Animation vs Math 2
3+3=60° 🤓👆
Now we need mathematician reaction of this video
The sound design is great
does the e^(i pi) fight not remind you of the fight with clippit?
I've never been this hype to see math!!
Wow, so amazing! Keep going bro!
new vid! watched 25 mins after post!
Everyone knows 9+10 is 21
4:23 nah bro that unit circle waas crazy
1+1=2
Every video that alan makes just gets more interesting
math is good with alan!
The fact that everytime the second coming experiments with equations he gets smarter every seconds
Next video: Mathematician reacts to ' Animation vs. Math'
my brain
This video make my brain cripple In awe
How to make math interesing
이과는 위대하다..(나는 수학이 싫어..)
i think i want to learn math.
10:02 cute voice
Bro actually got me to enjoy a math video
I love how most of the first half of the video is just The Second Coming messing around with random equations and learning more about math.
This video teached me more math than I could learn trough the year just in 14 mins
Pov: ur math teacher is watching this
I think, I Love Math now, 😆😆
my nightmare is being
This is masterpiece
And my real friend who is people doesn't named Alan
WOOOOOOOOW+❤
What an awesome video
Alan Becker always making interesting videos for us.
I'm such a nerd for enjoying this and I love it
2+2=fish
My head...
yesssssssssssssssss
Math strong weapon
"BR41N.EXE" not working I    wait      II force exit I
i like this math :D
And this is the way I can learn math
Alan just casually flexing his math skills
ccomment number 4235
Great animation!
Guys, this might be crazy, but I think this video has something to do with math.
please make a part 2  Edit: The big thing at the end is "Aleph Null" Am I Right??
Animation vs multy verse
I love this so much, amazing work yet again, Alan!!!
can someone explain what are the 3 symbols at the end that approach Euler's formula? I know Aleph (which to be frank probably the smallest Aleph-null), the rest 3 I kinda either forget or don't know.
What the monster looked like in the final ending could be interpreted as something humans had yet to fathom.
this is SO FUCKING COOL the sound design is CRISP
I wish math was this fun
Next animation ,,animation vs physics"
I wish j was so good as you at animating
MATHHHHHHHHHHHHH ❤
Bro made maths fun💀💀
What the hell
But how did TSC get stuck there in the first place? Is there like a flashback to how that happened?
Pov: my brain is on exams
What art kids think about while doodling on their math assignments:
Me watching this:  🗿"i feel smart"  Me in school with that one math teacher that directly writes and speaks at the board without looking us students:👁️👄👁️
yeeea 2+2=5
Math is like a star wars fight in this video
That’s no math. 10:48 (death star)
VIDEO YANG SANGAT KEREN! MENGAJAR KAN KITA MATH! (mungkin ini video satu-satu nya pembelajaran yang di buat oleh alan becker)
ok
This is new video
bro, i dont really like math, its one of my unlovable subjects but this... this is cool
Great mathematic The Second Comming!
imagine this isnt a random side story animation but what happened to TSC once he got captured by the hunters and he is just becoming a genius
It is not 11 it is 2 brua
NO 1+1=2 X 1+1=cute
bombastic
Request: Animation vs Alphabet Lore
Wonderful..
E turned into a sigma
See, stuff like this is why I became a History major. 😁
とりあえず凄いのはわかる()
Nice work Alan
I feel smarter
9+10=
no way
Very cool
4:39 Aw hell nah, Clippy 2
I never knew math could be entertaining
The animation quality was best
Ayo
Sfx gives me ben 10 vibes
Even math is better with these little guys
I really like it
bro what in gods name is this animation
Moral:" NEVER TRUST A "E"
e just deleted our friend
ALAN, YOU AWESOME GENIUS I can't express how cool this was for me as an engineering student. I recognised like 99% of what was going on and it was so epic!!!
Bro whattt? I don't have the words to express how amazing this animation is. You're the best.
77 + 33
excuse me what the fuck
Where is(!)(x
im immadiately if there was this lesson😂🙂🥰
This was so cool
My brain blow up for watching this video💀
TSC proved to us in this video that he learns faster than yellow and he is smart 😂
Everybody knows 2+1=21
Do you know whats cooler than animation,MATH
Dang this is amazing. Honestly it feel like back in animation vs  minecraft just because of the discovery and the gang lesrning the mechanics and take it to their advantage. Hope you or someone else create an explanation vid causr this goes out of my high school math knowledge
This was on my mind like 5 minutes ago, and i checked your channel and it came true!-
I'M SORRY FOR MISS THE STREAM
Jesus crist what have i just seen
This is just a bomb, I have never seen such talented people. Continue in the same spirit!
I'm just like voicing orange i'm just like mmmhhhh yes i'm learning math
This hurts my brain
1+1=2
Subscribe kaise kare
1+1=3 cuz mommy 1 daddy 2 make a baby that's 3
Crazy video
100 ×999=？
1+1=2
e 12:23
Thank for this film Alan!
Pov: TSC trying to learn math to get out Pov: WE trying to learn math to confuse ourself
1+1=3
Nahhh this is fr my brain in math test
And 2+2=22
𝙷𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒𝚒
This is how I solve for 1+1 💀
The best part is that I only just barely understand what’s going on
The graphic design in this episode was nothing short of phenomenal. The way e^iπ and TSC interact with numbers is so smooth and natural, and they use complicated formulas so creatively, too... Too bad it didn't fit in the narrative of AvA's grand story because this was one of the most beautifully animated episodes I've ever seen from your team
너무 어려워..

Early!
recognizing most of these concepts made me proud to be a math-cel
A new way to understand math 😮
The world will be a much better place if math is teached like this
OH S- I MISSED THE PREMIERE
At the very start I already knew this was gonna be a banger video
nao pegar = por i
It's fantastic work. I'm sure even a person who is not interested in mathematics will definitely be interested in mathematics after watching this video.
can't believe TSC just speedran what takes humans more than a decade to learn, and he gets to have an awesome bossfight while doing it, never thought i'd be jealous of a stickfigure lol
The animation is actually crazy!!!! This must have taken a long time to finish this, Alan you have outdone yourself!!!
i am so confuse right now
New series🗿👽📈🤑
1+1=1
Although I don't know any maths, however i learned math is huge, for watching this.  this is unavailable. Your ideas are so creative.
YOU ARE GOD
hi
Вао, нет слов. Это ахрененно
Your video ideas are always great
Bro is smarter than Albert Einstein
Its kinda a bit like Second Coming meet MINECRAFT but math
you should do gr10 stuff on the next  math vs animation ( need it for school )
many people said it before, but Alan, you are an absolute legend. You never fail to disappoint! this is literally so cool and creative!
Man, I love Math...
Yeah and 9+10 is 21
Its confuse but its very cool
Are you gonna make a new series
my brain gonna KABOOM after wacth this....
Too much for being complex
a
I knew that this math battle involves the topics in mathematics.
math problems we have learned  My brain: headache  math teacher brain=10:30
I can't even attempt to comprehend the more advanced equations, but the absolute beauty for how they're solved and changed was a marvel. I was absolutely amoured with sheer complexity and visual stunning choreography.
What a satisfying episode, especially 3:20 and 10:56. But, the question is... How did TSC get there?
The song was good
1 + 1 = 2
This is INSANE! I love it!
we want animations vs, Python
몽환적이다
Now this is the type of math videos that i want to watch.
wish this video was shown in schools in mathematics, teaching is much easier and more interesting this way
1+1=3:)
Alan Becker is the only reason why I passed math class
And that's how TSC became the nerd of the group
Alright but if yellow were in math world instead of TSC, they would have a field day.
I have a question how did orange got in the math unerverse did orange fell in the calculator app or something?
Alphabet??????
NEW UPLOADD
me fast again
cooooooooooooooool
imagine yellow being in there 💀
I never thought i'd see TSC befriend the letter e.
QUICK MATHS
(3×5+(√9×3+6))
I lost stickman
This is an impressive yet so confusing animation I’ve seen from Alan Becker.
if he animate this type of maths with stick man no one could not resist to study and understand math very easily❤❤
Walter white making the perfect meth in a nutshell
Oh forgot to say what I'm not green, I'm dark-green so I don't know can I talk about green because I'm not sure what I'm from thease university so I can be green and green is me...
cool animation about math I love it
Fc from Laos
IM EARLY TO A VID YAAYAYAYAYAYA
Let's be honest, most of us don't understand shit about what's going on in the video, but we still love it.
Bro just made math look so fun
Imagine after this event, the second coming teaches math to red, yellow, blue, and green.
Benim 5 yıldır çözemediğim şeyi tsc 5 dakikada çözdü acaba yeni bölümde ne olacak
Math😊
b
I love these kinds of videos I am a new subscriber and I have to say I really enjoy this channels content.
この動画が見て、数学がより好きになったわ。ちなみにi=√-1以降は全く理解できなかった😢
My tiny brain just got a little bigger
got me nostalgia?
I really love this animation, not only it entertains me, it also helps me refresh my mind about our math equations that can help me pass my finals. Absolute masterpiece.
IRL: me vs Godel's incompleteness theorem
Could someone tell me what is 9+10 is?
SHJT IM EARLY BUT THIS VID WAS SO COOL MAN❤🎉
Bro 1+0 is 2
part 2 or the next ones should be physics to high complex math lol
1+1 = ㅗ
I think I just learned the whole math.
I’m LOVING this omfg
0=1
from now i love Math!
artistic
So bro how did you get good at math? Me:
What I did with my calculator during math class:
Wow
YEAHH when sc found that dot we can see him next to a form of measurement and the form is inches (I'm guessing) this means that we can use it to see how tall sc is so sc is 2 inches tall 5:20
The fight sequence actually reminded me of game called stone story
baru tambah tambahan sama kurang kurangan di awal saja aku sudah pusing karna angka nya terlalu banyak.
Can we appreciate the fact Alan Becker has once again showed us something that we didn't think was possible.  Like literally how do you even make math look so cool and fun yet at the same time remain near accurate without messing up yet at the same time remaining somehow education?
That was a cute end
day after tomorrow is my maths exam for sure i am watching before going to give the maths exam
The power of curiosity
1 + 1 =3
Ok schools need to start teaching math like this, seeing orange turn math and graphs into the death star was actually insane
SICK IDEA MAN
I want part 2
Vreau partea a doua Cum salvează pe Foca Liviu și ăla negru
Who said 1+1 is 11. No its 1+1= 3
W + 0 + W
WOWWWWWWW
Maths*
Next up: Animation vs Meth.
بوجه رسالتي لنجم وبحب قلو خراي عليك عهيك مقطع لانو انسجمت فيه💔💔
This is the kind of maths asian parents expect from their 10-year-old child, stereotypical jokes aside, this was very well made & I'm sure math maniacs will love all the little details in this - ooh, I wonder if a math professor will do a reaction video to this. Again, incredible work, everybody.
Math lore:
The greatest thing that I am understanding what is going on
Bro triggered my high school ptsd again
2 much math to comprehend Get it? "2" much 😂😂😂😂😂
FINALLY, oh btw.. Alan.. when are you gonna continue the Animator VS Animation..?
Jesus alan you had to learn so much math
YES, I DECIDED TO LEARN MATHEMATICS AFTER THIS VIDEO (I will never learn)
Bro mastered mathkenises💀
Next will be animation vs code
A cada vídeo que passa eu me surpreendo cada vez mais com o Alan
👍
when are you gonna make a new wanted episode.I know your working on it but what would you estimate that it would be done
что
Це прекрасно. Алан Беккєр (надіюсь я правильно написав). Це просто пречудово. Зроби такий прекрасний файт, на рівному місці, ПРОТИ МАТЕМАТИКИ! Я в шоці, твої роботи, в мене немає слів, щоб навіть наближенно описати наскільки це прекрасна робота. Сценарій, подача, мальовка, звукодизайн. Я в захваті 🤛🌻👍
0:36 eww 😅
math ez win
this was actually very interesting
sheesh 145k in 25 minutes alan is exploding it
This guy never runs out of ideas
The second  coming learning math
FINALLY NEW UPLOAD I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
1+1 is 2
its more fun watching math animatoins when you actually understand what she is gonna do, and when you know math pretty well
This is one of the most creative work of Alan Becker's that no one expects it coming
Amazing work Alan!!1!
When orange becomes a teacher:
interstellar vibe
The math is giving me brainless
That music and tsc figuring things out how to make math formulas gives me that feeling of playing a new cyberpunk themed high graphic pc game on a saturday afternoon dude
It's 2
what is this video about and where did it go when it came out, why is it there?🤨🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Orang can manipulate math
2
1:02 Wait what-
Goodjob alan
Bro made math looks cool wth💀💀🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
yoo we need a whole episode of this bruh
i still wouldnt learn anything if math was like this
no one is telling about the delta's movements look like💀💀
0:01 math be like:
​1 курса математического анализа и линейной алгебры мне хватило только на 3/4 видео
11
this was weird
I love these animations 😀
1+1=?
In the last, I was surprised how huge the shadow is. But he, "Aleph", made sence for me.
It’s crazy how creative Alan Becker and his tea is 😮
Thanks For Helping Me Of Math ❤😌🙏🇹🇭
early
A
I wanna be in this universe. Also, this is going to come up in the future isn't it. Also also, I've watched this like 6 times now.
Awesome Video
Крутая демонстрация математике, как будто умнею.
I genuinely wonder how you think of things like this- I ain’t complaining though, if math was actually like this, I’d WANT to go to school
Гениальная анимация по математике... я был просто восхищён этой анимации😊
Plz pin  subbed for 5 years I’m on a new account so it looks like I just but no plz pin
nice
i am from thailand your video is awesome i will follow your work✨✨✨
No 1+1=2
that א at the end was scary af
Cool
Nice 🙂👍
What math algorithms vs stickman in calculator war
I didn’t understand anything, but very cool😮😮😮😮😮
2*2=5
how the heck did i just realise that math is fun like this 💀
Espect
1+1=3
so the idea of infinite imaginary space allow second coming to exit the math realm... is it?
this video learned me more than Scholl math
blud went from basic kindergarten math to advanced college math
When the plot!?
Daaaamn, that looks like a math i would like to learn :D
amazing
i now have inspiration to study my stupid econometrics math again, thanks alan
educational yet so good! very mind boggling!
I like how this is just Alan's team flexing their animation skills.
to watching this video i have now understood. the answer to 1 + 1 with solution  First of all; you must realize that 1 = 2. The proof is shown below.  x2−x2=x2−x2 x 2 − x 2 = x 2 − x 2    We all agree with that statement don’t we? We then factorize each side differently.  x(x−x)=(x+x)(x−x) x ( x − x ) = ( x + x ) ( x − x )    Then the two (x - x)’s cancel  x=x+x x = x + x    x=2x x = 2 x    Then the x’s cancel out.  1=2 1 = 2    And since 1 + 1 obviously equals 2, we can deduce that 1 + 1 in-fact equals 1.  1 + 1 = 2 1 = 2  1 + 1 = 1
bro destroy a math dimension
cool
Thats so cool. Alan tries his best just to entertain us is very wholesome
Alan Becker has been tutoring mathematics for 1 month
MATH
I think this is AvA s2 ep 2 maybe
Bruh make a new episode pls
math is fun they said counting is fun the said
1+1=2 🤓,Now everything makes sense...
There are 2 AvM's now lol
This guy is good at math
1+1 is 1 bcs 1 :)
The fact I have a theory,   The way The second coming wakes up like looking exhausted, looks like when he got his true power, in the showdown.. and the way he's all alone.   4:44 this looks like exactly Mr.smith/glass guy fight? Weird xD  13:18 The Thingy says goodbye, to Tsc! :c 13:42 There was other's? :0  I think it's the time the second coming wakes up? Well he get he's true powers? :0 or not? Let's find out!
So epic
This is an experiment for the victim after Orange was caught from wanted - animator vs animation
Alan beker!!!!!!
I didn't understand half of what the formulas were in this video, but damn Alan is goated
I just realized that when they strike it shows 0s because the swords are -1 and + 1 and when he shoots it shoots 4s because 2 +  2 = 4. Great attention to detail Alan! EVEN THE Es have detail because when they die they become equal to 0.
Wow it’s Like Baldi’s Basics!
Amazing!
It was really nice, well done:)
Some I know
This man understood whole maths into minutes
13 × 7 = 28
Orange should have put 9+10=21 Then explode the whole place to escape
수학의 무서움과 신비로움을 동시에 나타내는 영상
sound effect, music and animation is really cool!
what
1+1=100
Bro can make lore about math
Good
Everyone knows 1+3=B
I wonder where'd tsc go
I love this ❤❤🎉🎉 (He knows more math then me 😢)
​1 math = 14 mins
I have a question is it math or meth? Im also learning so much from this
Stop commenting
Gg
1+1=2
I think I understand math even less now
He be fighting numbers
Math be like😂
This video deserve like ,its must be hard making content about math
I love this version of math🤩
New animation!!!
When maths actually becomes fun
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ALAN BECKER
。
Bruh i understand this more than actual math. Btw i have many questions like is this canon or what if TSC broke it or is everything a dream from TSC??????
ALAN IS SO SMART
this video very good
😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮 😮😮😮😮
This is the most interesting Math lesson I ever had in my life.
Here we go again it’s going to be a good ride
Last! ❤❤ From India
Оранжевый: Алан можно я пойду на курсы математики? Алан: У нас есть курсы математики дома  Курсы математики дома:
The part where TSC killed "e's "robot machine" was so epic tbh! There should be a part 1+1 of this.
Math lore
Goodnight everyone 😊
if i wan that situation i will instantly die
2+2=5
Wery good
Its good that orange is learning math
My brain when math class
OMG ITS SO SATISFYING
Nice content
This is Mathemation
Orange casually passing grade 9 math while my fatass can't pass grade 8 math
This is the only thing that got me interested when it comes to math
Orange goes back.... Bro I can speak algebra!!
the music is well chosen
This some interstellar vibe. I fwi
When all was sleeping and i was realy need to make it work
I have created lore for this while watching, that's how good this is...
What 9 + 10?
man i hate it when im doing math and i accidentally make a death star
1:39 Wait what?
A single stickman taught me more than all my math teachers
This guy just taught himself basic linear math to advanced calculus in 10 minutes. Im calling BS on TSC learning capability
1+1=3
Love the vid keep it up
another masterpiece by alan
Human brains: ohh thats how ÷ is ok 70 years later. i dont remember nothing about math  Stickman brain: learns without a teacher
yooo that was sick
The animation is smooth af at 2x
А что случилось вообще, как он туда попал? Или я где то что то пропустил или не могу вспомнить нужный эпизод?
Thank you Alan you are amazing🎉
they're becoming smarter 💀
I live your videos❤❤
If i were to say E!
POV: You're taking your final exam
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
geometry video next? :)
Math lore be like
Anyway, apparently e^(pi*i) + 1 = 0 is "Euler's identity," so I'm personally nicknaming e^(pi*i) in this animation "Euler" No I don't know anything about math
I don’t understand this one
alan becker please continue episode 1 wanted pls
I need to show this to my math teacher
I know none of the maths
This is probably the first video from Alan Becker that we need an actual breakdown, part by part. Very well made Alan!
I'm 3 minutes in. This is ABSOLUTELY REMARKABLE, Alan. Okay, back to the video. Still 11 more minutes of true math CRAZINESS!! I LOVE IT ALL SO MUCH!! 😍😍
It would be really interesting if he'd tried 0 ÷ 0. It's okay though. Cool animation, by the way! It was epic!
Wow, its amazing!!)
Bro. Im in the live chat, that was fire! 🔥🔥🔥
I'd like to imagine this is a visual representation of what goes on in a professional mathmatician's head
1+1=3
he just made a death star
Math has never been this entertaining
와
רק אני או שזאת האות א?
So many views already?
dam I don't know half of the things in this video
Pin me!!!!
I thought id never see cos and sin again
Did this stickman just explain math under 15 minutes?
Smart
Never thought math was this cool
Cool
I was one of the first people to watch this in the shower
❤❤
I like how at the beginning it was just orange messing around with math and discovering all sorts of problems with it, and then proceed to start a war using the problems of math as a weapon to destroy e¡π...
Nice
Impressive animation
The best math video in history!!!
Math is my favorite subject
1 - 1 = 28 🤓☝️
this is ggggggggggoooooooooooooodddddddddddd
As a fifth grader I know small concepts it's what my math teacher teaches and still if he did then we wouldn't understand it but I know the basic concepts of a circle like the center the radius the circumference and the other things I completely forget the name it's hard to remember
I came back from the live chat this was pretty awesome
1+1= me and him 😢
As a math student, I can confirm this is how we do maths.
i love that animation
I think Alan becker is smart in maths..because he everything
this is why i love maths
so good!!!!
What's 9 + 10?
anwser the 3 questions correctly and you might get something special
This animation shows how genius Alan Becker is.
Well I take Algebra I and II, Pre-Calculus and AP Calculus. So I do understand what these mathematics.
I admired and enjoyed making mathematics so beautiful and fun! So 1+1 is 3, right?
10:10  so crazy
I'm enjoying the animation I'm a fan.
How about animation vs science?
That was a great video alan you did your best to make a good animation
Mam: You need to know math.  Me: Why? Mam: To draw animations.
MATH
this is so cool!
2.718281828459045
Alan Becker's animations are always the best. This one and every other is amazing.
This is the teacher teaching the class trash
1+1=1
Ахриненно я думал что это будет продолжение стикман vs аниматора vll
Might need this for a math exam someday
Orange used all his math skills to win math. Fascinating!
Is that Infinity
Absolutely amazing for both the animation and the Math.
The music had a very Interstellar feel.
War with math : Leeeeets goooo
Speaking for everyone here math has never been this interesting in our whole lives
This video made me love math more than I used to love it ❤
Now im sad cuz Orange stickfigure understood math 1037937 times faster than me
WHAT THE HECK- For an empty of void with nothing but the numbers, this is insanely good!
The editor needs an Oscar
didn’t expect that ending of the big N appearing
How did man make math so cool
FINALY IM EARLY 22 MINUTES
add more stick figures pls
Все началось с 1+1
Imagine he got sent to the wrong universe orange will goes into the science universe??
I never thought i would say that, but math was damn epic!
i love how alan literally didnt take any part in the production of this video lmao
👍🔥🔥
Im ganne say it  This is one of the most impresife videos you and your team hafe made allan The idea whas so origenal and the way he learns feels so natural  And thats whitout speeking if the AMAZING MUSIC
What happened next😮
Алан даже драку с буквой сделает эпично
Wait... 1 + 1 is 2?
I need 2ep Wanted
It was so confusing from all of the math yet so amazing...the effects cool as ever and the fighting scene??? Holy rooneys. And omg math lore real
2-4 years ago, I never expected I'd actually be disappointed for forgetting everything I learned in math class. I could've kept up with like... 20% more of this video if I didn't.
3blue1brown python library (Manim) be like:
1+1 is obviously 11 bro
Orange being too smart for his own math trying to stop e
That was strangely beautiful. No flashy colors or wild scenes. Just the Second Coming learning math, essentially.
How did he make a perfect circle
Alan teaching math + fight of orange = amazing
This is by far the best Alan Becker video I’ve watched (Please make more of these)
That was fascinatingly beautiful ❤️
Bro  made maths not boring in 15mins
actually useful for younger generations!
E
Es hermoso... Muy hermoso
Orange broke the math. How am I going to pass my math exam this Monday?
right as it ends i send something great
世界観がわかんねーや☆
Albert Einstein
Who said math isn't fun (Alan Becker did us a favour)
What
two words, THE MASTERPIECE
1+13
now i want to learn math this mans a wizard
i didnt make it that far in preschool
Alan made math op
O /|\  VS  1+1=? /\
comment
Thank goodness I got out of pre calculus
Make animation vs username666
Amazing
This actually hurts my brain
The vid was gud keep it up :)
i dont know jack shit about math but that was cool af
alan never fails to iterest us
Huh there is no p2?
So don't ask me about that im only NOT special broke the calculator...
Math fans will enjoy the facts Non math fans will enjoy the fight No matter what this animation is epic
1+1=2
Wow.
amazing
I'm afraid to imagine what would happen if instead of The Second Coming there was Yellow.
you gotta give respact for this kind of stuff
This is so cool
1+1=2
wow.. THATS AWESOME
Where was this yesterday when I literally just did my math final...
I can’t believe a stickman is helping me with math
Can someone please make a mathematician review this video and how accurate are each equation is shown
oh god. Im having calculus flashbacks.
bnbn
My brain is having a seizure watching this but you animations are supreme as ever
Just had this dream last night. It was mostly the same
Awesome
So fuckin epicc😂🔥
After the first three minutes my head started to hurt
That was fking incredible. Not only how cool it was but while that was playing I was trying to understand the math in there. I understood a couple things like the radius of pi and things but other than that everything else caught me off guard.  The other thing I liked about this was the background music. It just felt so mathimaticaly calming and soothing. This is by far my favourite animation from alan becker yet. Thank you for this wonderful video.  P.S This would be a great math-like learning video game for kids that are learning basic math and more intermediate students learning advanced things. If it does happen it will be GOATED
If our math teacher didn't play this at math class, I will be so mad
Hello, i am from VietNam. My English is very bading, your animations really pefect with me. For you one like.
Awesome video as always
Dude this is one of your best yet! Some parts look straight our of an anime! I didn't even know most of those things were in math!
Алан, прости что пишу по Русски, но.. ты просто замечательный человек! у тебя уже выходят оочень плавные и при этом атмосферные анимации! продолжай в том же духе, мы тебя все любим! ♡♡♡♡
Next, Animation vs Science
Okay
Can someone remind me what is the 2 + 2???
Кто нибудь что нибудь понял?
👏🖐
This actually helped me fully understand why you can't divide a number by 0.
Ah yes, they finally meet their true nightmares
bro went to grade 1 to graduation
I learned more in this than listening to my calculus teacher. AND THERE'S NOT A SINGLE WORD UTTERED IN THIS VIDEO.
math generation level 1. plus 2. minus 3. *EULER*
Bro got graduate from kindergarten in 15mins
Very cool but I didn't understand anything XD
I watch three times
Theres Many Persons In 1 Min ???
Now we are waiting for "Animation vs Language'
I dont have any words for this masterpiece. It just is so amazing, Good Job For You alan❤, I love the lore too, Its hella fun+Learning some new math that i saw in the premeire xD, Thanks For Making great anaimation Alan, You are the best animator in the world <3.
The + End
1+1=3
Это мой кошмар... математика
Did… did Tsc just make a Death Star?
I enjoyed pretending I was a scholar, learning from the whimsical antics of The Second Coming, and that dastardly e.  I could somewhat follow along through the discovery of The Circle, but then it became too much, and I simply continued watched as an enjoyer of AvA.
I hate that I know what’s going on. Thanks a lot trigonometry
Aprendendo matematica com o orange 😍😍😍
I just lived through 4 years of calculus in YT video... I'm gonna lie down for a while.
Now that I am sure I am getting a full grade at the final math exam I would like to thank you for this masterpiece
어렸을 때는 쉬웠는데... 슬프다
:)
❤❤❤
will you upload eps 2 in animation vs animators VII
I got to get my math teacher to watch this
I was incredibly confused throughout the whole thing as to what was going on.  So yeah, pretty accurate to maths.
Imagine that Second Chosen/Orange Figure is Smarter than Albert Einstein.
수학!!!!! 대!!!!!! 전쟁!!!!!!
MATH      no thing else
Math.
best examples to make your math presentation impressive
That was so good and also like if u agree
Amazing
Loved the video. Would have been better if it was yellow doing this though since it fits his character more.
Words cant describe how amazing this was.
This is probably the smatest video on youtube, I think i just got an additional - 30 IQ just from watching this...
A
pretty cool.
Everyone knows that 0+0 is 0
Dude, I want to give you so much more than just a like, like holy shit this is sooooo good
The video we never knew we needed.
Me having slacked off in math:   Finally something I can say I studied
Now you should make Animation vs. Programming with Yellow 😅
I have so many questions like How did orange get here? Where were his friends? And mostly of all is 1+1=fish or its 2+2=fish
Yo the hell was that, that was awesome!
1 like
I LOVED THIS SM
He did it. He made math entertaining.
Is languege vs animation next?????
The only math video i watched from the start to the end
DUDE school just ended let me rest
Very impressive, but can you make Animations vs 3D?
I see how alan becker has been hard animate of all these math number and symbol. with many example animation and many more examination with these many Learn of the everything and i wonder how long alan becker has been learning a math something of years. Truly amazing to see animation ever alan :D
Blue + nertherwart = desarster
I wonder why it wasn't Yellow doing this. I mean, he is the redstone expert (which involves a tiny bit of math)!
17 minutes into upload and already got 25k like and 100k view. Also this is me during Maths exam
Only millenials will understand being bored and only having a calculator for entertainment
Euler’s Identity absolutely claps King Orange and The Dark Lord💀💀💀  Jokes aside, this was probably the most creative episode. You guys had to do your homework and then try to incorporate all that in an intense, choreographed fight scene. Very impressive!
I thought it was a sequel to black, green, red, yellow, and others. In the end, it turned out to be just mathematical equations 😢😢😢😢
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😀😃😄👍👍
Man just learned the whole entire math in just 14 Minute👏👏👏👏👏 We can learn somehing from this
I love sound designe, and scifiness of it all ❤❤❤
''Sigh'' If only math was as easy or fun as this. Or have TSC help me out instead of my calculator.
you know you've had a hard time when you understand some of what's going on :D unless you are a genuis!   but this was such an amazing thing to watch, thank you very much for this fascinating animation that made math look good for at least a few minutes! cuz damn i hate math! xD but this is great
He did it... He made math fun...
Esto es bellísimo 😀
😮
I know this before so I don't need to stay in place like that, but if I stay in thease situation I would go out there for 2 minutes
YOOO EARLYYY
You can do animation vs géométrie or vs the théorème de thalés🤔❤
At this point I can feel knowledge flowing inside me
Im usually hate math but when this video came out it just feel hits different 🔥
"You can't make a funny action animation only with math" Alan: "Hold my stickman"
Math is one of my favourite subjects, but this is just absolutely *AMAZING*
Lol
That amazing dude i watching ur animations since 2018 :) I like them
M a t h s
If only Einstein saw this he would be the only one who understands it and understands the universe
My brain...
SC will be the best Math teacher ever.
1+1=2
This is how I imagined professor paradox got his powers
Need to watch twice to understand what the hell is happenning
I never knew alan can make me be interested in math
All the stick figures skills (Updated)  Red: The power and love of animals.  Green: The power of music.  Yellow: The power of redstone.  Blue: The power of brewing.  SC (Second coming) : The power of building. New skill unlocked: The power of math
MATHMATICAL!
1+1 8s three!!!
Man i barely understand any of this 🥲
Next series: Animation VS coding🤣🤣😁😁
math?
Pt 2 please I love it ( if possible )
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The creativity here is incredible, really enjoyed the premiere. Is it possible for this to be a series like the minecraft one? It would be so cool to see.
His IQ is just better than me! Im just 5th Grade 🥲
Me watching this is like melting my brain with joy and dread at the same time
א
The video good  The chat: i love poland...putin is gay...wtf is that ...man am out💀
Who would have thought that math could be used that way. 😮
That why math is very deadly
The return of the the king
Когда появились буквы я уже поняла что на этом мои знания заканчиваются
I love this!
.....My brain hurts but this was awesome
1+1=69.420
파이는 6이다!
What’s next Alan? First Animation then Minecraft then Math. Is it gonna be English? Roblox? Who knows at this point. Keep up the good work bro!
How did TSC get there?
1+1=2
That. Was. Incredible.
Yes sir😊
From nothing to ever thing
Who doesn't know math
How  absolute infinity?
Buen video.
can u please add greens singing talent into the next vid?
If math is like this Maybe I will love learn to math😂
That just made my mouth open through the whole video
next story is Japanes?
This video has gotten viral today.
Seeing math visualized in such a way is interesting
Oh i bet allen had to figure out all this math to make this vid
This is like "donald in mathmagic land" but for engineering concepts.
This is so beautiful.
the end is so cute! you made math fun for me because now when I see my math homework I think about this video lol
This is Oscar worthy.
Holy cow alan. Your animation are so epic, inspired, and amazing! The music are just so epic dude! Your amazing alan!
Hey
e was so cute
Euler
TSC just learned math much faster than I ever did in school
do physics next please.
This was a very cool and fun Animation! This is an Interesting Way to make You study with fun!
Is this canon to lore?
Looks like orange got stuck in a calculator
Everyone always knew 1+1=3
The Moments when Orange was just messing with the equastions were Prize worthy
WE CALCULATING THE EQUATION WITH THIS ONE 🥶🥶‼️‼️
1+1=
This is amazing Alan!
I should rewatch this video after I’m done finishing high school!
1=1😂
And now my brain hurts just by watching
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
And that’s hoy Tsc became smarter than normal UnU
'So what are those alphabets?'
No its 1
Well i din't know anething it happed i just know abaut those 3  + = -  and just it, and the și literele nu ar trebui să existe în mate, din cauza că nu fac parte din ea
i’m supposed to hate math, why am i liking this so much??
I watched this video and I'll tell you: Fiction + Masterpiece + You're the Best + Stickmans = Alan Becker
We need a spin-off series of e's adventures with his math friends
The second albert
bro im 14 and my brain did not understand anything except the first 5 minutes
Words cannot describe how i'm feeling right now...    Numbers however.
My brain died
Wow🎉
My brain's burning 💀
Numberphile must watch this
The End is kidy of not unexplained. (i don't get it).
I love Alan Becker
the great version of math is the machine math and so this is also the greatest animation i have ever seen in my whole life because of how smooth and machinery it was
I learned more math from this than what I learn in school lol
If only math was cool
Ah that was SO GOOD GREAT JOB ALAN
Beautiful
So that's why my parents said math would be useful in the future... To understand this video!!
I wish my maths teacher have also teached us like that
The king of legends is back
Оч круто😭
my math teacher when I say I won't need math
TAHT WAS AWESOME I LOVE MATHS AND STICKMEN TEHY ARE AMAZING
bto pulled out infinity
TSC's definitely going to pull out the calculator app on Alan's PC as a weapon someday after this. 💀
This is just like alphabet lore!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Mathematics Power
pp
Man this is so great! I can get good grades from math while watching animations! Thanks Teacher Alan!
2=1
the 259 that disliked hates math
It would be even cooler if Alan used latex to write the formulas
understandable
woooo lol
Why is Orange in a void in the first place anyway?
i dont know what it wants to say🤨
i know learned that by learning math, you can create a death laser to eviscerate all your enemies with
Ok so Green can shoot out musical notes and now TSC has the power of  me- Math. TSC is just gonna be the most broken character if all of these episodes are canon.
bro learned math faster than i can learn distance and midpoint 💀
ВООБЩЕ ТАКОЕ СЕБЕ НЕ ЗАШЛО ЗАДУМКА ГАВНО ВЫПОЛНЕНИЕ ГАВНО ВИДНО КАК АВТОР СТАРАЕТСЯ СВОЮ СПОСОБНОСТЬ ДЕЛАТЬ ХОРОШИЕ БАТТЛЫ ВПИХНУЛ ИХ В МАТЕМАТИКУ ЗАЧЕМ?
Cool
Я мозг сламала
HI
I didn't understand anything but beautiful 😊😊😊🤯🤯
The usage of the radius, pi, circles, and imaginary numbers were so awesome! If you really understand math, this video is 100x more interesting.
Me after watching this: Ahh....... thats why math is so important.....        THEY FRICKING USED IT AS GUNS, ARMYS, ROBOTS, WHAT DE HELLL
That video was so awesome😲😲😲
I love the detail of aleph at the end being a giant, since it's a very large number compared to everything else
I loved math, until they introduced letters in it.
ABSOLUTELY GENIUSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BALDI IS IMPRESSED.
FORGET SCHOOL MATH LESSONS I NEED TO PLAY THIS NOW IN SLOW MOTION 🤣🤣🤣!!!!
Legendary moment we only see orange
The fact that I understand a decent amount of the video actually shocks me pleasantly!
Imagine, Animation vs English
that was amazing, thanks e and sc
I wonder if these are where TSC goes when he dreams, the sleepy guy. Bros been to the Backrooms, this math plane, and that physics loop. Also Animation Vs Set Theory when
Alan Becker: The guy who can turn Algebra and Trigonometry into one of the most epic things you'll ever see.
Alan this is the best your video and you explained math for me
Wow. Just wow. You fucked my brain up.
Bro they confirmed that they are so powerful they can destroy realities like king orange can destroy the entire Minecraft verse and TCO and tdl can destroy realities and more traveling around and raveging around TSC even without using powers they can destroyed anything
bro has the IQ of a God x 2 to the power of 14.02
this should be enough proof to pay attention in math class
Me with 2 Braincells
This is fucking eye candy holy shit My ears are experiencing heaven
Fire animation
I know about maybe 30% of this and I did higher maths xD amazing animation though, even with something like this you still manage to make it epic. loved the wave lasers
Even Stick people hate math
Math video: ❌️  Alan Becker's math video: ✅️
how is there so many content
e? 15:19 😅
cool
1+1=❤️
brooooo
Man this is the best animation I've ever seen but I might not get math in college or any school that I might go too
Me with my first ever calculator
DI LUAR NALAR CUY
Holy shit, that was fantastic.
10x15=150
Who knew math would be so epic
WOW Aleph 0
So basically, Alan found a new way to teach math.
Aleph in the back at the ending… This was very well made
I want to see you do animation vs undertale
i have my finals after three days and now Alan is giving me more math
Now im permanently in this premiere B)
Next do animation vs english
best one he has ever made. my math teacher would be happy
1+1+1=111 yea
Alan Becker's animation always makes my day!
Everyone knows it What’s 9+16
So it is a episode i was correct  and not 11
1=1 Is it really?
this was incredible, and the chat was so amazed
man we need another part to this
perfect
This is the only way I’m into math, if Alan Becker does it.
Even Though People like Us Have No Life. But Math is Extremely Important
Wow
Most beautiful, when you see these videos, you also like math
bro got the number lore.
OMG I DON'T KNOW ALAN IS A GENIUS BROO
Im confused
Hello Alan becker! I'm from brazil and in brazil you are very famouse in animations!!! I love your videos
I didn’t understood after 5minute cause I am 10 years old
Is that the hole into Alan's PC at the end?
Wow. The way this man has grown. Went from silly little animations to FULL ON MOVIES. Who knew that Math + Fighting = E N T E R T A I N M E N T not me. Well done Alan. Can't wait to see what the next episode has in store.
I hate how while watching this I understood the equations as they were happening and how it animated so well despite it just being numbers
Here's Maths Stupid, what mean about e？
4:45 how euler felt while creating his equation
Epic!!!
??
This is the kind of video you watch with your both eyes wide open and not missing every second while not understanding what's happening and at the end you be like What the hell did I just watch
Imagine math class can be that destructive
Awesome, simply awesome
We Learn Maths whole Life but he learn in 10 Minutes 🤣🤣🤣🤣 My new Teacher!😂
WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW
0:30 me when I’m bored in maths:
Don't forget, these are all real math symbols and equations.
this video made me smarter than the whole school curriculum
Good animation broo🔥
best thing ever
That was the most epic battle I've ever seen since
THIS WAS SICK! Glad I Was Early!
Cool video, appreciated it
日本人で見てた人ー
This is amazing Alan, it not only thinks about something good, but also teaches us mathematics! (A little bit probably)
this was epic AND I LEFT MY MARK IN THE CHAT
11:19 HE GOT SPINNED ONCE AGAIN
This guy managed to make maths cool.
THIS WAS THE BEST!!!
It was amazing I can't describe it❤❤
Joder eso si fue cine
Now I know why mum telling me learn maths😂😂😂😂
Wow!! Love from India
Bro made orange say the entire math column
THIS IS SO GOOD, I LOVE YOUR ANIMATIONS ITS SO SMOOTH AND AMAZING! 💗
Wow TSC, She Is a Math Matcher, Get It!
Who would thought Math could be this Powerful.🤯🧠
Me vs my math exam in a nutshell I love math but oh my God it gets harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and gasp harder and harder and harder and harder and harder and harder
I can't wait for teachers to find this and then use it so that younger kids will finally remember what all these symbols mean.
e is just like Clippy the office assistanr.
Holy shit this video taught me how to do *MATH*
Only Alan and his team can make unironically cool and creative af weapons using math
Imagine how many calculations he made just to make this video 🙂
PTSD asides masterpiece as always
How the heck did you make math intresting?
Φζδ Ελλάδα μόνο ρεεεεεε 🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷💪💪
i didn"t even know that mathematic could be so dangerous 😆😆
Can't wait for a video reaction explaining every formula in this video
I look forward to seeing people who understand math making videos explaining what I just saw
Hh
I get prank i think animator vs animasion epi 2 😢
Because Mathematics is Very Hard. But We Need to Learn Math for The Existance’s Life
This evolved from stick figures messing around with computer apps and games to them now using infinity as a gun💀
If 1+1 equals eleven then 2+1 equals TWENTY ONE
I learned more math from this animation than my freaking school
WTF
James helped you with this, didn't he? 😂  I love it
My favorite subject 😅
wheres the green red yellow and blue bro
:D
Adam 16 dakikada matematiğin dehası oldu ben 7 yıldır anlamıyorum
I WATCHED THE PREMIERE
I'll just pretend like i understood all of it
I feel like i just went on a mathematic LSD trip
*INCREDIBLE!*
This dropping on my Birthday was pretty dope 🔥
I had no idea what kind of math they were doing
so orange is dead forever and never. when is part -1?
i barely understand math and this stuff is pretty cool
18 minutes ago and already 100k views
Q foda lek
OMFG, SOMEONE LITTERALLY A NERD NEED TO REACT TO THIS AND EXPLAIN IT ALL OMG. MY BRAIN IS FREAKING EXPLODING 😂
This is the best animation!
Me at the back of class playing with the calculator:
The way that these characters interact with the digital world around them never fails to amaze me. The action is always so creative !
Bro learned math quicker than the whole world
The team is amazing for doing something like this, the genius behind all of this and the person who planned the whole thing. I'm pretty sure most of those equations add up to what they're doing and makes sense. Props to the team!
How do you even animate math
1+1=3
who knew numbers and letters moving around would be fucking sick
the nerd: math is a subject. me and my bois: guys prepare for the next battle (math exam)
After watching this fight, I gotta say that this made math much more interesting. I'm surprised how fast TSC learnt math!
สุดจัด
IT WAS SO CUTE AT THE END
This was so very understandable at the beginning and so insanely confusing at the end and i loved every bit of it
Amazing video
매우 재미있었습니다.
I used to daydream about math in the future with VR (or an advanced version of it) you would be able to do this with math.  Needs mind usage but man can dream 😅
Math will be much easier and enjoyable when they teach it like this
I want The Second Coming to be my Math Teacher
I did not understand what i just saw ?
홀리
Interesting
no way he got out with MATH,🕳️👄🕳️
Addmath teachers are probably very happy with this
That was perfect🎉🎉🎉🎉 i like it i like it very much this is the better video i watch it
new episodes!
At this point, i dont know If Alan has 1000iq💀💀
Window
Bye + bye
Yes: = :1 3
Orange stick man explains math while battling e (COLORIZED)
Euler virgin vs epsilon gamma enjoyer 🗿
That was an amazing premiere.
So orange became god with math    I’m convinced his IQ is like 9927$728137171329@@@##%)%/$717(2#7;7-8;29
And someone says that mathematics is not cool.
just watched a stick figure have a war against math and I already feel smarter
Dude went from making his own drawing into life, To making his own equation fight against him
My brain couldn’t handle this
Very good vidéo
bro was fighting against the bugs in nevada 💀
Даже математика бывает эпичной
Math lovers are gonna enjoy this
I hate math, but this was an absolute joy to watch. Even if I understood almost none of it. And the music was awesome!
1+1 is 2. Talent + Creativity is Alan's Team!
... ¿Un matemático que nos lo explique? :D
ITS THE BEST ANIMATION
DAMN THIS VIDEO IS GOOD THAN AVM
bro from agent smith to more rollercoaster and now to math
Que obra de arte
Casually revealing the equation to dimension hop
Insane work, I'm sure every math we saw were logical in the fight and well used. I'm trash at it so I understood almost nothing but it was so impressive, I can't man, pure art
Sick
I LOVE IT
😀👍
Maths are badass
There was a hidden aleph at the background at the end
Coming soon animation vs spelling
WHO WATCH THE LIVE START TO END   👇
Amazing, i loved the video!!!
Seems like Alan Becker is very good at math
When you put your head down for 10 secs and that happens
Mha
thT WAS SO GOOD DAMN????
rip the 4th graders in premiere
What if allen just secretly told us the key to teleportation
I've learned much more from this video than I did in school
O, Buguei meu celébro com tanta conta 😅
I..lost my words by alan's Greatest qualities...This is masterpiece!
Bro we need a program where we can play around with the laws of math like the Second Coming did lol.  Also some fun stuff here: The e^(iπ) algorithm is known as "Euler's Identity" and if the image is brightened enough, you can see Aleph in the shadows at the end.  Really awesome stuff there, GJ Alan!
Amazing.
that was an equational battle if i ever saw one.
Orange visited the math relm
Super cool
Its was a legend move
this is the only person who can make the letter e expressive without a face
1️⃣+1️⃣=2️⃣
:)
77+33 = 100
This is why math is hard.
This feels like a project Alan has been wanting to do for awhile, it just has that vibe to it despite 95% of it lacking any color, or technical detail for that matter
Bro went from addition to the fabrics of what makes math math
This is good
I was here when it came out
At the end, where did TSC go?
E
That was cool
0:20 My Math Homework  3:18 The Math Test
That was glorious
that was so fire.
That was awesome!!!
I still hate math. Ain't nothing gonna change me
It was... SO COOL
Thx for killing my brain 😉😃😃😃😃😃😃😅
Why was the letter א doing there at the end and why is it so huge
cant wait to see a math teacher react to this and see if all the equations were right lol.
Does this mean that TSC is now friends with math itself?
thank about alans hardwork.
That was insane
Now all we need is to figure out how TSC got in there in the first place....
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Gotta show my math mate
i keep refreshing the “newest” comments for the live comments
WHERE%
they turned math into a fight cinematic
Это просто великолепно!
That e is a homie at the end
와 ㅁㅊ 진짜 이야 아니 개 간지네 진짜 뭔가 표현할 말이 없다 진짜 쥰내 개 쩐다
ℵだなあれ
Can TSC be my maths teacher
I JUST WATCHED IT IT WAS AMAZING
bro learn math faster than everyone
I just KNOW that math teachers are gonna be showing this in class
YEEEES
i don't really understand a part of it, but i love it so much
I cried at how this was so beautiful
A Stick figure can explain math better than my math teacher
The End
Math is Extremely Very Important to Study. Even Though I’m Terrible at it
Due to the fact that i don't understand math i did not understand this whole thing except for the part where sc was apologizing
that was amazing
頭をつかって戦うってこういう意味だったんだ
The second coming goes to school And has to fight math equations
Honey! The cool stickman guy uploaded again!
This is so mathematical! ❤
Singlehandedly making math everybody's favorite subject
1+1=3

my braincells are still exploding
Thats a lotta math
alan is the only guy that can make math genuinely interesting
WOAHHHHHHHHHHHH
Aleph 0 at the final walking lmao
Now we need to see one about programming!
Maybe I didn't like math at school, but this is ridiculous
天才としか言い表せない
hoy aprendí cosas que no entiendo ni entenderé nunca xdxdxd
Moral of the story is, um, hm, idk
Man they didn’t even try to negotiate at the beginning. Just massacred all of the e’s.
Best math class EVER!!!
After this video I feel like a math expert.
2+2=5
I don't know what this was about
Alan's creativity is infinite.
NICE
1 + 1 = -1
🎉👏👏👏👏👏👏
It all started with 1+1
Well I’m really late for this 😅
so weird
looks like someone's been doing their math homework
I AM D FIRST COMMENT!
YES!!!!!!!!!
Math can help TSC, but Math can't help me:(
Turning Maths into RPG Techniques... PEAK FICTION.
Noo ï joined at the ens😢
I don’t need the math teacher anymore
it made math fun hahaha
A battle against my entire childhood. Truly the fight of all time.
sheeesh
I don't know math that well but this was fucking awesome!
this is such a cool concept
Let's all be honest. None of us understood anything here.
א
That's just awesome
Let's be honest and determined that, The second coming and the stickmen always curious about the surroundings but in the end they became friends ❤❤
i understand -1% of this
That. Was... EPIC!!!❤❤
This is the most beautiful math video.
This was epicccccccc
Vau
It's official, it's math

It's takes lots of skill and imagination to make this
Wow that was a epic ride
1+1 it's 5
And thats why maths are dangerous
I need a video where a mathematician explains every thing in here lol
After my year of pre-calculus, I can proudly say I can apply math to my every day life.
I love math now-🤓🤓🤓
THAT WAS SO SICK!!!!!

It makes me realize that TSC actually stuck in calculator 😅
This is so creative and cool! 💖✨

THAST ME!! THATS ME IN THE VIDEO!!!
Very cool
e
pls do animation vs alphabet
I don’t like math we know😂
I like how I don't know that much yet he is new to math and he's good
The amount of education alan has to do before making this video is absolutely incredible
I feel like after they started constructing advanced animated contraptions and weapons out of numbers and symbols, it stopped being 100% faithful to Math Canon
K?
Што здесь тварится
Orange got better at math then me is a few minutes, then I have in years
Joha lox
An animation that's too advanced for my pea brain but I enjoyed nevertheless
اني هسة دخلت بث
This need to be a video game!
E
next do "Animation vs. Meth"
The spine 13:50
čovek omg
this is an accurate representation of math in school
1+1 is 11 because it does not have an equal
Go go go go go go
Me in math class:
I have never been this engaged in math since i was born
My favorite part is when the letter e letted out a war crime after they made a mech
Best way to learn math and not get bored
Πώς καταλήγουν τα μαθηματικά στο μυαλό μου όταν έχουμε😂😂😂
1+1 = Magellan  Obviously
Power of math!!
Things your maths teacher don't want you to know
bro created death star
Holy math my arch enemy
Math teacher can beat it Let's go to school
Never thought this would happened.
I love how TSC just made a goddamn deathstar
1×1+1=1
Themis math grade 5
Fun fact: if you water a water, it grows.
i can see this being play in math class for elementary kids
My brain felt fuzzy while watching this😂
How did he even end up here and where are the Fighting Stick Figures???????
Wow Orange seriosly made deathstar
This is me when in a math test
This is When Math is Actually Fun for Once
What if there was a white character?
this made me like maths more than i ever did.
"Yes teacher, this is why I didn't do my homework."
Ng lupwet
Bro making math look like fun 💀
War the math
Finally something I understand after learning math
Ayy you know
comments and live comments???
Imagine if @alanbecker make Animation Vs Geometry Dash and Animation Vs Roblox
E
1 + 1 = 3 :))))
Wew robot e
This is math not math battle
Alternate title: TSC vs Math Construct III
This battle is *C R A Z Y !*
People who dropped out of college feel stupid now.

🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Best maths lesson EVER! 🤩
Math is all
I love how kids watching this confusing too much 😅
How teachers think we are going to use math in real life:
Math teachers will soon get a look at this and say damn.
kids gonna really watch this to become smart (even if it doesnt make them)
1+1=3    -_____________________-
1+1=11

Orange adventure inside black hole be like :
This is very epic movie! 10:27
Wow this is such a cool video. Only problem is I don't understand any of that math.  Update: Its been 2 years. I understand some of the math (i started maths alevels)

My mind in a math exam:
SUPER YOUR ARE BOOSS
Привет всем
This is so cool!
Only Alan Becker can make a video about maths and we’ll all genuinely be invested in it.  Edit: GUYS PLEASE STOP COMMENTING ON HOW THERE’S OTHER CHANNELS THAT CAN MAKE MATHS-BASED VIDEOS THIS WAS COMMENTED TWO MONTHS AGO AND I WAS JUST IMPRESSED AT HOW ALAN AND HIS TEAM WERE ABLE TO EXECUTE IT I DON’T WATCH VSAUCE
this is my first time getting interested in math but still don't understand what's happening
That Was Seriously Epic!!!
Imagine if orange replaced with yellow
I am so amazed by this
So instead of continuing AvA 2 bro decided to make an entire new series
1+1 is 2
If he’s our math teacher, we would wish that every class is math class.
And now, we wait for the Speakonia dubs.
Кто зделал вообще правила цифры увешается умешается равно с плюсов сколко × ÷ = +
Bro Alan about to use this in his presentation and impresses his teacher
I was here
This is the scariest episode ever ngl
Ohio. Math
Me: 1+1=2
💀💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: This video is all only mind games made by TSC or The Mercenary,Thats why there were no other friends there
Vs math be like in your brain 🧠🧠 😂
This video is the perfect way to learn  math
Cool animations
Nah bro i cant do this anymore 💀
Cool😂
Alan is really showing his Asian heritage with this one.
I’m too dumb for this 😂
1+1=?
this is literally the nightmares of a high schooler doing advanced math
wow
Algebra geometry
This is one way to learn math.
Wow TSC so smart
New
YOU CAN WINNNN
Ohio no
Alan Becker must've at least alot of degree since he can calculate in this animation perfectly
I think this should be shown in schools in algebra class
Everyone knows 1+1 is 3
BALLS ORANGE USE POWER OF JESUS
Dang man, Alan proved us that math can be just as powerful
Bro tsc learned all math in just 1 video and i learned it in 12 years
a maths major would love this
I'm impressed with Alan Becker that can make animation like this can look so amazing. Especially this one, I'm not good at math but Alan Becker make Math look interesting
Now now, let him cook, he's beginning to believe.
I just know some math teacher finna put this on a smart board for some kids 💀
I SAW DUOLINGO IN THE CHAT
wow
Come on TSC
Its 11
I understand around 90% of all of this
Where was this video when I was studying AP Calculus?
LETS GOOO ❤❤
How to do 1+1=?
holy crap math lore
1+1÷11
*OMG THIS IS SOOOOO COOOL*
What's crazy about this is that it gave me a lil refresh on a topics I didn't use to understand 😂
Alan now teaches us math in an more of a fun way ❤
How the hell have you made maths cool?? I wish it was like this in school…
Hay wey mi cerebro

Mathematicians will love to see this
👍
It's awesome as usual 🤭

It's just GENIUS!
Hola
Alan
According to my calculations taken seriously:
Alan sure be teaching us math with this
...
∞ + ∞ = ?
That's a cool concept of math rlly Big W for Alan Becker
nerd’s belike when they fight over a higher test score
Making me start hoping they teach math like this know to actually keep me intrigued.
Being a computers student, this is the best thing I have watched all month
To think that this started off so normal and devolved into absolute madness. How can math be this interesting 🤣
i hate math
I'm after primary school and I understand what's going on there but my brain lags XD
TSC is becoming smarter 😮
YOOOOOO
My man TSC taught us everything school did in a matter of minutes.
The Attentions to Detail and Smoothnes in these is so insane like when the +1 Sword from TSC fights against the -1 Sword it makes a 0 as an animation Really Great Work again!!!!
U create so really good
Man why dont school's just do it like Alan?
What 9+10?
Good grief I made it in time for the Premiere
1 + 1 = 3
Only orange
This teaches me how to do math than my teacher
Gg
Math in grade 1: math is easy!  Math in grade 7: why do i hear boss music?
Blud somehow makes math something fun to see💀
Bro is so cool
1 + 1 is 6
Это ведь чистая математика
Hi
wow...
The numbers mason, what do they mean!?
Woo yea math
That feeling when a YouTube animation teaches you math better than school
I don’t understand replay the video but easy to understand
Here before  over a mill it’s at 5k
As a mathematician I can verify that this is Math.
This is how they should teach math in school  Kids wouldn’t be so bored
TSC be like: I'M THE MATH GOD
I would actually pay attention in maths if it were like this lmao
When you learned more from this video than from school
e
The best maths video ever.
ez
E
Nah
This could actually teach you math. Just watch Alan Becker and you’ll be fine. 😂😳👍🏻
ok but how did the chosen one got trapped in a seemingly endless black void?
:)
The simple amount of creativity that comes from this man is ridiculous, this man somehow made math fun and interesting, like *how do you even do that?!*
A yes math
Fantastic premier.
Ждал также как возвращение данкара

Hi
😲Wow

This man, Alan Becker, manages to make MATH super entertaining. It is Alan Becker after all. So much props to him!
*All the math professors crying in happiness right now*
if i ever become a maths teacher (never) im showing this to my students
I don't know about math

If you thought seeing letters in Maths was confusing, then wait until you start seeing stick figures. It's all fun and games until you need to figure out what Red stickfigure multiplied by Green stickfigure plus Blue stickfigure divided by Nether Wart is.

Alan Becker is my inspiration, been watching him for over 10 years, I started to make animation but they aren't as good as Alan's. But thank you, for entertaining me for all these years, even if I had to wait months for a video. You are and always will be my favorite Youtuber. I can't make to watch this! Thank you for still making videos after all these years. You are so talented and your team is talented, I just can't thank you enough for your inspiration. Have a good day to anyone reading this.
