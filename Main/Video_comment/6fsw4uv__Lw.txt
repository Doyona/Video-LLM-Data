ok
Weather peoples pray to your Jesus for heavy snow fall in UK, england never city  London.
Alex Deakin, is so absorbingly when he talks, I find he explains things so will for us laymen. The only thing that would improve all these forecasts, would be @metofficeuk, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, SAY THE DATE, of the forecasts. YouTube algorithms keep throwing in old forecasts.
We will have one of the worst winters in record to hit the U.K. along with deaths of those who can’t have their family support system due to COVID and now brutal weather.
I hope not
0:15 at 0.5x speed. Thank me later
Blm will hope its not.
I just watched a 7 minute weather forecast saying they are unceratain, very helpful
I’m 47 and remember when we had proper snow this time of year and it was cold, wet & fantastic being a kid (wet gloves in your coat pocket , that remained wet the next day)
10 day trend📷https://youtu.be/ipLFlQMa3NY
I hope so, it will certainly give some much needed festive cheer
2021 the year we have district based lockdowns with greater police enforcement of government guidelines, riots and unrest during the hot summer , vaccine found to contain DNA altering additives that make the human race more susceptible to new strains of viruses 🦠, death rates rise around the globe mainly due to severe allergic reactions to new vaccine................ a script far more far fetched than a Tom cruise movie
The last white Christmas in London was 1970, I was 3 , the question is after 50 years will it happen again ......
Everyone pray for snow on Christmas Day 🙏😁i hope we all get some
Would rather it snowed start of feb
Ohhh the weather outside is frightful and the fire is so delightful since we on full lockdown let it snow let it snow let it snow ⛄️😂😂👌👍
Size of those nodules !!!!!!! Hmmmmm
Possibility of overnight frost, cold and frosty and sunny during the day for many parts of the UK on Christmas Day and any snow would be confined to the Scottish mountains. There's a possibility the first half of January could turn severely cold as high pressure builds a Scandinavian high with extensive northern blocking, pushing the jet stream further south down into Portugal and Spain, easterly winds pushing into the UK, this severe cold air would be originating from Russia. I wouldn't rule it out for January.
Omg please snow in  northeast england on Christmas. I think it's going to turn colder but I cant imagine snow for northeast england if we lucky we could get tiny bit of sleet lol. But let's hope. Stay put American snow storm. Let our northerly polar air kick in.
How is turning colder good news?
I'm uncertain
Lol we never get snow it's boring as. Stupid jet stream
I'm liking those anomalies over Siberia over on the karstenhaustein website. Not warm ones for a change!  Off the chart.  Maybe it's an indication...
I keep coming back here even though I live in the netherlands XD  this tells me more then our own weather news
FxxK SNOW ..... hard enough as it is for people to go anywhere  this year.
Great vid - are those rainfall accumulation charts publicly available?
Thank you Alex
The 10 day trend is always more interesting when the weather is uncertain, and this may have been the best yet. Lots of nuances to describe, all excellently presented. Thanks and Happy Christmas.
Typically excellent presentation. Making uncertainty simpler. A difficult job that in 7 minutes.
Will it snow in my area. Pls let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Merry Christmas and a happy New Year best of luck in 2021 to everyone have a fabulous day ur lovely family friends enjoy ever min of it stay safe 🌲🌲
I hope everyone has a wonderful Christmas and a Happy New Year!
