Wade: *Jumps in front of ghost and looks at mark*  *Music goes soft* Wade: "Youre on your own now Mark" *dies* Probably the most cinematic and dramatic thing Wade has ever done
They killed Shawn he’s in the locker that where they hid his bones😂
God knows how many times I've re-watched marks phasmo series out of boredom.
The fact that mark could have died with the cards if it werent hunting
really wish hed do more of these, the new updates would make a great new phasmo vr video
Man I really hope Mark and the gang come back to the game cuz SO MUCH has happened since then AND whole new maps being redone/added is crazy. I heard the newest map just blows everything else out the water
I’m glad that whatever reference Mark was making at 24:38 isn’t being talked about in the comments. Meaning it has faded into obscurity - as it should.
Idk that howdy camper meme. I looked it up and now im even more confused. I just wanna know where it came from?, what's it mean?, and stuff. Helpsies?
30:27 Camp Crystal Lake, Ghost Central. Fantastic
The coffee cup conversation they're doing is still the funniest for the past 3 years lmao
I don't know if I am correct but "Hantu" is Indonesian language means ghost. They mostly not dangerous but some of them are scary. The most dangerous entity is jin or siluman "youkai" in japanese
Wade: if you talk while it's hunting you have a greater chance of dying  Mark: never stops talking or screaming 🤣
18:13 this had me crying laughing
hey its their 5 year celebration and there is an xp multiplier its also almost october...... soooo maybe some more ghosty videossss...... plez
32:12 good thing he didn’t overreact
Mark and Bob have one brain cell between them sometimes.
Need to get a group of friends who wanna play games like this always enjoy your content.
Can you show up to me and my wifes wedding pwetty please 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I appreciate your candidness with how you process and deal with everyday situations . You are a beautiful person on the inside and out . As a women who is also autistic and recently traveled with a flight that got delayed 3 TIMES due to bad weather in my arriving city . I relate hard to this 😂
How did mark not die? He literally drew death.
Bob: Wanna see what happens? *Bob dies a few seconds later*
Wade saving Marks' life JUST to make the game more scary will never not be a bro move
watching this series after the Grafton and Bleasdale reworks... is incredible how much the game has evolved and changed since this. :)
11:00
The fact that Mark could have brought Bob back if he didn't pull the cards during the Hunt is so funny to me
1:01 years mark your in a safe space among friends 😂 1:14
8:19
10:26 Very funny Bob😂
He looks so asian with the round glasses lmao
Not the tarot card keep changing to the fool. Lol. With its literal meaning new adventures lol
What's the track that plays at 10:54? I tried looking up the Phasmophobia Soundtrack, but all I get are Music Box or either Male or Female singing tracks.   Sorry if this was answered already, I couldn't find it, haha
is this the secret of the mimic all along? that it mimics ghost orbs?
24:39 - 25:10  whats the reference
31:15 to 31:40 once again, horror movie perfection.  Wade's _panicked_ "It's here, its RIGHT HERE.", the immediate static after Bob's "im dead", Mark calling for him, Wade comming on the walkie talkie "It killed Bob." and the creepy note immediately after. so good!!
Mark's first time with the Tarot cards.. he even gets the High Priestess, but because he drew it during a hunt, it didnt matter!!! That is so sad to see!!
Mark your a coward
1:08 you deserve that
Remember Mark treat Wade like a friend
2:16 well… I did a little off camera grinding… A G A I N (said Wade) 5:19 hello, Majora’s mask moon
Hantu is literally, ghost but translation Malaysia to English 😂
5:18 Literally didn't expect😂
I adore that whenever theres a threat, Mark just stands there. He consistently gets warnings from his friends beyond the grave and does nothing.
30:23 Friday the 13th reference
3:09 "I'm the guy in the bra" says bob
omg, 9:05 " your problem was not drawing enough cards" and getting a hanged man, was gonna be so funny if it didnt turn into the fool xD
Was that the bite of 87
I need more phasma 💔
Man I wish they'd play this again. A LOT had changed since this video, even as recent as a few days ago
I love wade 😂😂 you was like let’s brig this down a little squeeze wade was like ohh uhhh no😂😂
*pulls high priestess*  *during a hunt*
You need to play more phasmophobia
Mark is the type of guy to draw death and not die
This is a safe space guys 😂😂
@Markiplier you should get the boys back together to play Phasmophobia now. The game is soooo much better than it was. There’s so much depth to it now.
5:19 the editor does it for once :D
30:06 it's DORK
Hear me out abt the ghost lady in the thimbnail
I would love to see y'all play more, especially once the new update comes out :)
Here's a tip mark when reading taro cards and you get death get high priestess as fast as you can it will have angle wings on it. It saved my life in game more times than you can count. It basically kills you but brings you back to life you die for a second but can revive and come back but it can only work on the person dealing cards only
When Mark drew the hanged man at 9:07 i prepared my self for laughter but was deeply disappointed when the fool came
level 1536 is crazy numbers. the Catholic church should hire this man😂
The most infuriating thing about this is how Mark drew the High Priestess, which normally would've bought Bob back, during a hunt thus rendering it useless.
if u turn on the lights it will help yoursanaty
in the bath room for the first game
WHats the reference
5:18 Mark doesn’t know in the future he’ll fucking despise the moon.
he looks like long lost twin of Keanu Reeves
Is this a jojo reference?!
old phas is crazy lol   watching this in December 2024
BRO GOT A HIGH PRIESTESS
The cup being thrown at mark while he’s dying 😭
0:05 level a thousand
I’d love for the boys to jump back in with all the update they’ve done since this.
Mark drawing the hanging man  (the fool, theres a star man-)
The reason why you didn’t show up in your book and wade didn’t show up in his book and both of you didn’t show up in bob’s book is because the photos you took were not age appropriate
mark ligit pulled the death card got me laughing like hell
mark your ghost always has a crush on you, man
It pains me because Mark could literally be a BEAST at this game with the way his brain works
12:47 when Wade is lecturing Bob and Mark about how bad they did and Bob goes “Dad?” is seriously underrated humor 😂
1536!
Him just getting the rarest card in the game (the hanged man) and just casually playing boggles me😂
25:00 what was the reference, camper?
Mark, Robert, and Wade back at it again
5:17 that scared me so MUCH
John Madden! Aeiou!
22:33 "Open ne noor!"
So Many Updates missing a member called "Somanyissues"
"Aaaagh! I can't SPRIIIINT!"
I had to come back to the Phasmophobia streams because of how awesome they were.   Hoping you and the guys get together again someday to play some more Phasmophobia and to play Midnight Ghost Hunt. :3
Rewatching this, i love how he draws the three rarest tarot cards first try
*Hi
I wished he continued playing this to see the newer ghost like a thaye deogen and moroi and see the newer maps like the lighthouse and the secret that comes with it
LMAO dying at Mark and Bob instructing Wade to twerk on the camera 😭😭
What was the howdy camper reference Mark made? I tried finding it but couldn't.
"Is that the death cup or the go there cup?!"
Was that Jason's mask in the water
I’m pretty sure a mimic is like one and 200,000 chance
i like how mark completely forgot how to play the game and has reverted to play with card and hold camera like you're in outlast
Oh my, the moon was much scarier than the whole game. i nearly peed myself.
18:00 ish - i love how the motion detector beeped 3-5 times without them noticing and wade just unknowingly in slight danger
why did the moon actually scare me LMAO 👇 if your watching in 2024
"lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare!" *an add pops up*
*Wade asks Mark to look in the door. *Mark starts having The Rake flashbacks.
I miss this era of phasmo, it was so gooood T-T
So wade is 61.44 times the level mark is……😅
Mark keeps pulling The Fool. 🤣
Mark: "John Madden. John Madden."  Me: aeiou.
what happened with the mirror happened with my friend and i, i basically leaned out the truck, called for her, saw her in the entryway, holding it, saw it crack and the door slam. went in, and boy oh boy, her dead ass was behind three lines of salt. Quite cool. i love the "he might be fine-" opens the door *dead*
Not gonna lie, pretty good intro
Mark's entire deck is Pot of Greed.
We don’t really do intros anymore  Mark THIS IS THE INTRO WELCOME TO PHASMOPHOBIA BOOM BOOM BOOM 💥
I lowkey wanna see those photos from the truck from Bob's screen/pov :D
forehead. 1:55
Bob and Wade just radomly threw objects at him while trying to lure him into a "Death Trap", Mark should've just found evidence and left. And also, I deeply love how the Maple Lodge Campsite is a reference to Camp Crystal Lake from the FRIDAY: The 13th franchise, that's very cool
The fact that he drew the 2 rarest cards whilst it was hunting. He's lucky the ghost was hunting when he got the hangman. Too bad he couldn't bring bob back
Mark is lucky the police didnt show up in the first round since he was literally surrounded by corpses 😂
I must say you have nice glasses mark
the sound of disappointment in marks voice he realized the ghost was not showering.
Am I stupid, what does the Howdy campers thing mean???
24:00 for reference, the mirror breaks when its user runs out of sanity. If you're low sanity, the mirror will break faster.
The way Bob says "there is no shower in here, where is the ghost showering?" Is positively adorable ❤
Mark: Bob fight em.  *door immediately opens to show Bob's dead body*
Nobody:  Wade squareing² his level up after every episode: get game🗿
@Markiplier, that was your best intro yet
pin this comment, no balls
WADE IS LVL 1536!!!!
My favorite parts: 11:18 12:16 - 12:40 13:12 - 13:36 15:30 17:12 - 18:16 32:59 - 33:23
We're getting close to release boys!
Mark is really bad at survival considering the first thing he does when the ghost starts hunting is keep his flashlight on, stand at the exact same spot instead of hiding, and scream at the top lungs. And yet he’s always the one that survives.
Anyone else laugh hard at his intro!😆
The Jason reference at 30:26 had me rolling!! 😂
my question is how many people searched up bumbum on to steam to try and find markiplier and if they did did they freind him and did he freind back? Also how many people were casually in a game wih markipleir like when he plays online games with other players do they even notice? that would be legendeary! Also did anyone else try to find bob and wade on steam 2?
_womp womp_
the way mark said eugh when wade was neat to him when he turned from the billaboard
1:38  that caught me off guard...
1:08  was that a edited sneeze?
Notes to self: 08:25 Bad news, everyone! 11:00 Wade just went "good luck ur fucked" 17:10 The boys make a Wade video. 18:33 They profit off the footage.
people who think the intro was crazy 👇
He’s marks savior ❤️ 11:03
I really wish they would play serious 😢😅
Him constantly drawing cards was so funny and after the hunt he literally could've died to the hanged man
the way i lost it when he kept drawing cards
8:14 dude 😂😂😂
when mark was looking at his booty got me laughing lol
3:26 ngl im playing this game now and a raiju is easily my most encountered ghost seen it like 7 out of 14 times
real talk though the easier difficulties just add time before anything happens, I don't think it would actually help them any haha😅
I know what Mark was talking about.  Cut the yellow wire!  😁
I really want to get a deck of tarot cards someday.
i’m so happy to go back on these videos and see that you guys have been such good friends for a long time it’s, something special, don’t ever let go of these people
GOODNESS!!! I WAS DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND I HAD MY EARPLUGS ON AND WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING I GOT JUMPSCARED AT THE BEGGING WHERE THE CLOSET WAS AND I THOUGHT IT WAS IN REAL LIFE AND I FORGET I WAS WATCHING THIS VIDEO!!!! 😫
I liked theos ghostly voice.
the moon jumpscare killed me 💀
Wades death was so funny my chair laughed
17:55 Wade just violently twerking like that😂😂
Wade caught in 4k
Rich Carlton of camping lmao ik someone who grew up installing millions of dollars worth of floors for the rich cartons. Lucky mf
I love how this video has 360° Audio(For headphones meaning audio appears around you wherever its being played)
The best markiplier intro 0:06

24:49
Mark: does everything possible that should get him killed  Also Mark: manages to not die and is somehow the last one alive…
11:12  I was laughing so hard lol
"don't talk when the ghost is hunting" Mark: *screams*
17:50
8:08
-2c "we have freezing temps" haha tell me you're American without telling me you're American.  Any Canadians here? Lol
YOU'RE A WIZARD MARKY
WHAT ABOUT ETHAN
hi (:
So when's your group picking up Lethal Company then?
mark: hey lixian, turn the moon into a jumpscare! lixian: does exactly that me: *jumps* oh god…
I had to write a 500 word essay about a mystery story once, but I had to think of one on my own. That is when I watched this and had an idea, so I made a 500 word essay about Mark, wade, Bob, based on them playing this game and got an A on it
Marc: The Fool! Me: Praise the Fool!
How did bob not get the in space refrence, he was a part of the movie for christ's sake
17:46 GOT ME CRYING
The Blink 182 reference was amazing
Based off the zoomies my cat is doing while I watch this, I think this video inspired him to go ghost hunting too.
8:17 correct mark the card that starts a hunt is actually called death, but since it was a cursed item, it started a cursed hunt which just means the hunt would’ve lasted longer than normal if it went ended early by bob dying
If i’m going to die throw the cup at me (nothing happens) Music starts to play (A cup appear) OH SHIT I’M GOING TO DIE
Wade and Bob using the coffee cup to guide Mark is one of the funniest things i’ve seen and we can’t hear them either. I’m laughing like crazy now
Why did I actually jump so high at 1:00 😂
Some drugs and a shoulder rub sounds so good😩
Why does bobs character actually look like him😂
Mark drawing tarot cards and spouting ninsense is peak comedy
1:52   The photo of the boy on the stairs by the railing…   Isn’t that the little boy, Henry from the old Arnold Estate (Conjuring House) ?
"If the ghost is hunting and you talk at all apparently it can hear you and find you and kill you" Mark: *Proceeds to yell every time the ghost is hunting*
1:09 Bless you
wasn't there an episode of Distractible that had a ghost called the Hantu Tek Tek😂🖤
That moon jumpscare got me i had borh earphones in on max volume i threw my phone and jumped
I love the idea of hiding from a ghost, being found and as you die you just get indignant. “BuT MaRk WaS tHe OnE TaLkInG!”
"DOOOOOON'T DOOOO THIS TO ME, MAAAAAN"
man pulled priestes and hanged man during hunt
I forgot about mark pulling a “DORO! MONSTA CARDO!!” on the tarot deck lmao
what is the reference that mark is making?? “howdy campers you made it just in time”
JOHN MADDEN??!
Come back to this game and try it on nightmare difficulty!! 😂😅😭😇
YEAAAA PHA PHA PHA PHASMOPHOBIAAA
Is it just me, because when I heard them say 'cursed item' my mind immediately jumped to Jujutsu Kaisen..?
Markplayer there a new update since you last played can u play this game again
MORE PHASMAPHOBIA PLEASE 🙏🏻
YOU GUYS HAVE TO PLAY AGAINNN
You need to play this game again it got some more huge updstes
I wonder if Lixian cracks up while editing
5:24 Starsee and Hutch 😂😂🔥🔥🤙🏼🤙🏼
27:27
I love this game, but I have no friends to play it with
More phasmophobia content for the huge new update?!
I love it how Mark talks to Lixian like Mark is Batman and Lixian is Alfred.
33:10 the final death
not mark talking after being told the ghost could hear him talk whe hunting
Anyone know the song for 17:50?
24:36 what is it a reference to?
Currently watching this horror game while it’s midnight and I’m eating with headphones loud asf 😂😂
Wade really be carrying whenever he plays the game XD
ignore this
lol how much did wade play this to be that level
Mark has the survival instincts of a toddler.
I personally think phasmaphobia should allow dead players to communicate through the spirit box
mark please, you always get the fool if you try and draw cards during hunts
I miss the Phasmophobia  videos
Wade is the red m&m, mark is the yellow m&m and bob is the orange m&m thank u for coming to my ted talk
We need more of this content
John Madden is an incredible reference
Ok, someone help me cause im lost what is the "howdy camper"  reference to??
What is the “Howdy camper you made it just in time” in reference to? 😭
watching this video for the first time and was not prepared for that moon jump scare even though it was said lmfao. just about let out the biggest shit of my life from it, jesus.
this is the bst vid ever. keep up the good work bro. so scary and funny
Any moon related jumpscare always will be the mm moon. anything else is blasphemy
I wish Mark would do more of these. Absolute favorite playlist!
The fact that Mark drew a high priestess card (which can revive dead players), but it was during a hunt which made it a fool instead, has me screeching in agony. Bob was practically inches away from coming back from the dead smh.
31:14 horror movie voice style
There’s a massive new update that came out today on Phasmophobia, it would be awesome if you guys did a new video with all the new equipment and other new stuff!
32:11 - i would love if that was hes honest reaction in a horror movie
Slaughter simulator, lets just stand in the room and die lol
Wade killed bob he closed the door on him😂😂
The coffee cup made this so hilarious😭😭😭
I need more phas content mark.
All these comments about the cards and not one JoJo reference. Okay then! HERMIT PURPLE! I'll see myself out... ... Magician's Red!
Fun fact:the last picture when mark says lixion show all the the pictures,the boy with the glowing eyes,is an actual photo from ed and lurrein the ghost hunters
I miss these. And raft gameplay.... WHY MARK WHY??? WHY DONT YOU PLAY THESE GAMES 😢😢
8:28 man his luck 😅
mark: “ew, your face everytime you turn” 😂 1:53
That intro was amazing, you should use that intro all the time.
17:55 I lost it when they put the music behind wade LMDAO
Mark got me dying laughing when he say what  footage
Wade saying God Jesus😅😅😅😅😅
that moon jump scare actually got me haha
Wade sacrificing himself for mark (and snapping his neck) was so hilarious for some reason
The Moon scared me ngl
damn epic intro
This is my favorite intro, and this is also one of my favorite series with Mark, Bob, and Wade. 3 years ago I was introduced to Mark playing phasmophobia :)
this is clearly the best episode
"Could be a Hantu"  Hmmm....Could be the Hantu Bob talked about in distractible???????
You should have lixian pop into your videos more often
Hilarious 😂😂😂😂
27:34 "No, that's a child's creation, it's a glory of the imagination" *Literally a symbol of the Blair Witch"
30:25 It’s Jason
24:55 Wait
15:37 That’s how I smash my keyboard 🤣
1:38 The way it fell out 🤣 10:29
YOOO YOU GOT SO LUCKY WITH THAT HANGED MAN
I enjoy that they mention even a bit a noise from them the ghost can hear yet mark does everything besides being quiet😂😂
It's amazing how this game and a combination of Bob/Wade/Mark/Jack can create some top tier horror movie scenes and reactions.
5:43 haha Emo song reference 😭 AND I’M SO SORRY-
They found a reference at the dock and they didn’t even notice 😭
I love how they are just able to make a scary game hilarious. I've been playing this game with friends and on my own and it's fun to actually use the cursed objects, I hope they release more cursed objects soon.
8:26 "i got bad news" proceeds to draw more cards 💀
Best intro I've seen in years
O god
Jason Vorhees refrence was cool
I began playing phasmophobia today. Absolutely 100 000% more terrifying then watching it. They also did so many updates, the game looks so different now. U should do a return Mark.
Geez how the hell did that Majora jumpscare get me
Ngl that moon jumpscare got me
17:50 when your parents walk in
THE MOON.....  moon:booo me; runs to the nearest hospital
the fact that the moon jumpscare jumpscared me
Oh f$&k the moon jumpscare hahahhahahahaa
I like when Markiplier wears his lil glasses. haha
MARK OMG YOU EXASPERATED MEEE quit drawing so many cards man 😭😭
29:55 Where that ball come from
10:38 to 11:04 is the funniest thing ever 😂
The Moon 💀
5:42 THE BLINK-182 REFERENCE OMG
Loving the new updates. I also had 4 new ghost ideas.  1. Devil: only reveals evidence during hunts and only hunts when someone says its name but otherwise has 0-5second cool down between hunts.   2. Fey: can move or take your items or similar trickery based tactics, during hunts saying its name slows it down / makes it stand still briefly, or has a chance to end the hunt.  3. Anomaly: only reveals clues which do not clue into what it actually is, requires you to test all possible evidences to see what is missing rather than what is present.   4. A Legion: a group of two or more ghost types haunting a single location hunting on their own schedules but occasionally overlapping.   As a bonus I would also like to see angels or seraphim put in somehow but im not sure how that’d be done lol
On the first run, markiplier pretty much lost all his sanity before even leaving the van😂
😍
12:49 Mark reminds me of my choir teacher, he is the worst. He won’t let anyone speak and try’s to get them out of their comfort zone. Which isn’t good for me, he made me have a mental breakdown.
i love phasmophobia i hope you guys make more of this content if they make more major updates
8:50 Aw, if you would have drawn that outside the hunt, Bob would have been resurrected :( 9:05 And... you're lucky it was still hunting...
It was always Jason Vorhes ghost at the camp the whole time and go to 30:21 to see his mask floating in the water.
mark casualy forgeting how to run
I wanna see more of these guys together
The most professional por… I mean ghost hunters… I’ve ever seen! 😂
I hate that I HEARD him tell his editor to make the moon a jumpscare and I still almost cried and launched my phone when it happened 💀
That was the camp that Jason is at in the movies cool easter egg
10:54 whats that music
the intro is perfect
"is there supposed to be a skeleton foot on the floor?" how was bro so calm about that
Lixian is the best editor I've seen in so long 😂 that jumps are got me
11:09 had me in tears laughing 😂
22:55 poor bob just got locked in that made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂
24:39 In Space with Markiplier Part 2 reference. Nice
Oh you are so lucky the ghost was hunting when you pulled Hanged Man. 1% chance to draw; instant death. But since it was hunting you get 100% chance of getting The Fool until the ghost stops hunting.
Fun fact : the smudge stick can save you from the hunting ghost, when you uses it when the ghost is near it Will go to a random place giving you a chance to escape ITS grasp
First 5 minutes and I've already died from not breathing lol
32:13  *Dying Wade noises*
Phasmphobia has actually updated A LOT we’d love to see more of it 🫶
I don't know the reference :(
"Mark i think it killed you"
You should play phasmophobia again, they have added a lot more updates and the game has been greatly improved upon
Mark: tells Lixian to turn the moon into a jump scare Me: hears “JUMPSCARE” and immediately skips 10 seconds Also me: “YOU AIN’T SCARING ME BUDDY!”
For those of us who had no idea the significance of the tarot cards, I’m surprised to see how it actually was. When I first watched it, I was confused and didn’t really know what they were. So, seeing all these comments really surprised me. Mark is the all powerful.
Mark is really good at standing still when the ghost is hunting
Gets warned the ghost can hear you. Proceeds to scream while it's hunting
When he said hermit I immediately thought hermit purple
This is even more funny after watching Bob's pov first lmao
Wade sounds like those roblox ass hole trainers in a fire fighting group or something "so that was the worst hunt ever do better "
YOU PHASMOPHOBIA VIDS ARE SO COOL
Death means you die but the fool clears your hand so basically resets everything you’ve drawn
I like when mark was left on his own because he watched both bob and wayed (I don’t know how to spell hi name sorry) and when the Friday the 13th Easter egg showed up
Mark playing with the Elizabeth deck
''me rebembering caulk''🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
he just survived the death card… impossible
Bob: Dies after drawing card Wade: "What card did he draw? Death?" Mark: Proceeds to draw card of death
Love how no one mentions how Wade's level increased by about 800 since the last episode.
32:00 Just saving that for a mood boost XD
It'd be cool if, when someone dies, they can still talk but through the spirit box, and if the ghost enters hunt mode, then they can't talk through it anymore.
1:37 slippy boi 6:07 putting your what on the tripod? 6:43 accurate examples, guys 8:17 Yes, that's a card you can pull 12:24 DED! 13:16 DENIED! 13:30 merging what? 16:05 You ok, mark? 16:37 semen lights 😂 17:14 Ayo? 17:50 This is YT, not PH 26:34 no sh*t you're outside! A little Easter egg, there's a Jason Voorhees mask in the lake by the dock in the campsite
2:40 seriously all I could think was Miles Teller
Am I the only one who thinks Shawn brings the funny down cause I loved this one but the last one was only ok
he pulled both the high priestess and the hanged man scares me 💀
2:47 WHY DOES HE LOOK LIKE SHANE FROM UNSOLVED
How do you sleep after playing phasmophobia I have brown stains after a minute of that game by myself
They need to play this again
Can we just talk about mark and bob making wade do unspeakable things for pics?- this was making me laugh so hard 😂
I have a headache from laughing so hard - I needed this lol
Bi
Please
Play Son of the Forest
18:04 LOL
11:04 that was amazing. Very cinematic. Perfect timing.
Thanks for the 10/10 intro Lixian. Actually, it was pretty epic👌
When mark when to the Door in the lobby ai jump
8:55 bro got trolled by the fool and a explanation for that is because the high priestess revives you again after you die
1:09 uncalled for Wade
17:11 the start of Bob and Mark just going to admire Wade's backside While Wade is clueless lol Idk why but this was one of the funniest moments in the vid xD
Mark is like me playing this game 😂 pulling the cards my friends until I start screaming and shiiii😂I got devil once  ran right into the ghost and now I get crap for it on. Daily so 😅this game gave me nightmares
The moon jumpscare almost scared me
And the artificial "scary music" continues, and it's still terrible.
1:07 say hello to Beth the ghost and if you look up that’s Bob the ghost   Sadly they aren’t in the game anymore :( I miss them
Lord minion level is nuts
Is gloom ok?
Mark's inability to stop talking absolutely wasted him, and it's hilarious
32:09 😆🤣🤣
30:25 no way in Hell thats not a Jason Reference
22:52 probably the best.
istg they the zesty trio 😪🙏🏽
"i'm gonna sell this" **that aged well** ps: he has onlyfans thats why
This was 9 months ago and the game is still so different.
The sequence with Mark drawing cards, the coffee mug, and him continuously managing to somehow survive is easily one of the best Phasmophobia moments.
'If the mirror breaks, the ghost hunts immediately.'  Mark no!
Moon! is also how I react to seeing the Moon!
No one else gonna mention the quotes from in space pt 2 during the camps section and just before they got to the camp?
i actually got scared from the moon jumpscare.
Majora’s Mask Moon
moon jumpscare actually got me me dying when mark using tarot cards in hunt AND GOT HIGH PREISTESS
Mark: “Level 1,536” Bob: “well someone has to carry this team, might as well be me”  *all 3 die on the first game* 💀🤣🤣
RAWR LA ARRR RAWR!!!”- Wade 😂😂😂😂
18:00 haha funny
32:10 "I CAN'T SPRINT" -Wade 2022
🧱
8:15 is funnier than it should be
I’ve never been more amused by a coffee cup
Wade and Mark making me act up 😩
Mark is told they need to be quiet during hunts or they'll die..... proceeds to scream at the top of his lungs almost every time the ghost hunts...... a very Mark thing to do.
17:58..The real homies with witness 😌😌✂️
jõhň māďđəñ
Whatever happened to Sean ? Wasn’t their a 4th guy ? The one with the Irish accent
More phasmophobia pls
Did Mark make an In Space part 2 reference
11:03 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tarot cards just existing: Jojo fans:
Me, a tarot reader watching this: "hm, yes. *Cursed item."*
Mark hiding behind the tripod is the funniest thing I've seen in this game. Then continuing to pull cards when the ghost was hunting 🤣
you guys should all definitely play forewarned, it reminds me a lot of phasmo and although it's difficult at first (or was for my group who all skipped the tutorial...) it's quite fun
How did Mark get the fool every time 😂😂😂 So fitting though it's hilarious Also Bob as a ghost is amazing  And so helpful!
such a beautifull view 5:15
The waffle house has found its new host
NO, ME * aggressively snaps neck *
Greatest moon jump scare ever! 😂❤
cant believe theres a jason reference in the game
Mark: *goes to the safe space creepy room* Voice: ~hey~ Mark: AAAAA
another phasmophobia video soon?
1:38 "Man I'm dead"
Bro got highest priestess and hanged man on the same deck lol
This is probably one of my favorite games to watch you play 😄😂
Hmmm, shed + tent =...Shent?
Bro I got a heart attack when I saw the moon jumpscare 😂
pleeeease play the newest version! <3
Why'd you keep talking during hunts ovo;;;
Why did the moon jumpscare kinda scared me 😅
Nobodies talking about how the homies got spicy for a minute
Not Wade saying do better when he killed himself on purpose- 💀
Bob the entire video: HA JI BU I DON'T LIKE THAT BAD
I’ve been playing this game and I still need help with putting things like the video cam on the sticks things and trying to get the book to open I need help I just got a computer to play video games on so I’m still learning
Yes the classical guys game night and it’s grown men joking around and screaming bloody murder in a horror game 😂😂
The fact that his tarot cards was mostly positive
I love this game
Can I get a HOYAAAAA
how did mark pull both high priestess and hanged man.
lixian that jumpscare scared the shit out of mee
Bob has a stack of Levels
At 24:56, what is that sound? I’ve heard before and so many people use it, but what is it from?
10:38   Imagine this was you in real life what to do  1. Panic  2. Stand there frozen in terror  3. Run.
Markiplier are you secretly John Wick
The Jason mask in the water, lets gooo! Thats a fun easter egg. :)
MARK DREW A HIGH PRIESTESS HIS FIRST TIME USING THE CARDS!!!!
GREAT GOOGLY MOOGLY GOD ALMIGHTY GOOD THING IM ALREADY ON THE TOILET DROPPING A DEUCE BECAUSE THAT “HEEEY” AT 1:09 ALMOST MADE ME SHIT MYSELF!!!
I love how he sounds like Donovan the fbi agent from Mafia 3 😆
I like how Lixian is cultured and used the majora’s mask moon
Anybody else think the upside girl in the thumbnail first looked like a goat or some animal
5:17 scared me omg
there shint
That first ghost woke up and choose violence
At 10:18 you can see legs running lol
What if... You met a pregnant ghost girl?
11:02 The "YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW MARK" got me 😂💀🤚
Wade jumping in front of Mark to save him was heart warming
It’s way more updated now!! You guys should play again!!!!
"turn the moon into a jump scare" Me: You AHHHHH
that old safe room gave me nostalgia
That salt shaker looks like the ones they have in Greece, except this one is red. Love those though they get moist very easily if it's humid.
BRO PULLED A HIGH PRIESTESS FOOL AHHHH
i like how mark is just like LIXIAN DO SOMETHING MAKE THE MOOON A JUMPSCARE
its the careds is crest
pls play more phasmophobia pls
"I think he killed you"
This was very funyn
My soul left my body...
Where. Is. Jack...?!
Bob died to the hantu tatec
THE FACT HE GOT THE HIGH PREISTESS IF THERE WOOULD NOT HAD A HUNT HIS FRIEND COULD HAD BEEN REVIEVED😭😭😭😭
"Thats right you're on your own now mark" -actually dies*
24:37 what is this quote
Howdy camper
What was that capers joke a reference to?
Got phasmafobie a while ago so could we play
Where is slenderman 🥺 he’s on the edge of the map/outside near the fire pit 🥺
the torch always being on😭
Hearing Mark useing the computer like that reminded me of that one video of his. Why can't I computer!? Why!? XD
17:50 the most I've laughed this year
the change in mood at 30:59 was actually so terrifying and nobody talks about it
5:19 I ACTUALLY DID JUMP DSGHSODHGO
My cat watching you too❤️🤪🤣
The first thing he was holding I thought it was a propane tank.
23:45 .I'm confused about Hantu is Hantu mean ghost but in Malay language or is a type?
I dont think anyone sees the humor behind Wade turning around and said "No youre on your own" and marks like "what? Why?" Then it looks like wade just strangled himself lol
ah yes, camp leader mark
I laughed way too hard at 24:38
The fact that mark thought he was gonna die in the safe space how do you die in a safe space?
Me a jojo fan hears wheel of fortune me in my head there is a transforming car in a house😂
Mark the fool
The damn coffee cup 😂
Aeiou was the correct response 25:50
I think this video came out before space with markiplier, but now i get the howdy camper refrance.
22:58 Mirror - shows something Door - closes  Wade - Now he's dead I laughed way too hard
20:03 GAY MOMENT ?😳😳
Why does Bob ironically look like Shane madej
this guys casually doing some corn
Hey camp markiplier! Cut the yellow wire!
I just realized that the “lets start this camp off with a scary story “is in the In Space With Markiplier 2
I'm reading all these card comments and I'm still so confused 😭 what do they do?
What if they added a card that made no place safe in the game. Or one that makes the ghost nonstop hunt for 10 minutes or smth
that jumpscare at the beginning sounds like the ghost is sneezing at you xD
they need to do the new map
11:01 Wade literally pausing the horror, "No, ME!", sacrificing himself, "that's right you're on your own now Mark!", then dropping dead... That is just the most *Wade* thing. xD
First third Mark just be like: “Go Lixian!” “Use ‘Editor’” like he’s some frickin pokemon. 😂🤣💕
I think you will like the new one! This update is so much fun!
I dont think Mark understands that he needs to NOT TALK when being hunted
You should play the new update they just updated it
Famous last words: That's probably a good sign right?
The sugar fox council likes this
Are their full vods available? I couldn’t find them on twitch, not sure if they exist at all
Well now yall gotta play again.
Imagine the world without editing
Mark's idea on selling the mirror instead of using it. Genius move on producing cash. However, I don't think you get bonus cash on taking a Cursed Object with you when completing the level...
It is 2 19 in the morning right now and when he told lixian to turn the moon into a jump scare I legitamitely got very scared. Also my fault for pulling an all nighter watching tons of his horror vids
i swear that bob sounds like a person from employee of the month
The fact that they took like three minutes to go inside because they were making jokes is hilarious
Wade: be very very quite during a hunt Mark: UHHH?!OH GOODNESS ME! THERES A GHOST!
Yikes! Holding electronics such as photocamera and videocamera during a hunt helps the ghost locating you.:D
I agree
If u think lvl 1500 is high u should see insyms lvl 👀
“If you talk while it’s hunting you’ll die” ghost appears “ahaaaah the camera it’s a good sign aaag
i think the mirror breaks when you run out of sanity
“That’s uhh Steve.”  Steve: 💀
I could watch several hours of this, you guys are just too entertaining of a trio.
Why does mark look like harry potter with those glasses 🤨     plot twist.... Mark IS harry potter...     Nah 🌝
Honestly the best part is how Mark almost never knows what is going on lmao. There's always one person in the group tbh
LMAOOO UGGHHUUGGHH!!! I’m cryin 😂😂😂
11:02 a great sacrifice by our hero
Imagine dying to a ghost named keith
5:19 i skipped to video to directly this park i hate you editor
WHERE HAS THEIS VID BEEN AND U PLAYED IT AGISN YSS OMFG
5:17 Im crying from that
Put. The camera. Down. Already.
I love the horror references in this Phasmaphobia map, from the Blair Witch totem and the Jason mask which is just amazing
I love how bob died from drawing the cards, then mark did it a ton of times before his body could even hit the floor-
Definitely a big update. 😁 Looks great 👍🪨
my fav (mostly wade quotes) from this video-  “speaking of skeletons in the closet…” *skeleton comes out* “oooh he’s uh… slippery!”  “my advice would be… do better, and that’s pretty much it!”  “level 1536?!?” *”well, someone has to carry this team”*  “what kind of ghost are we hunting?” “a cougar.”
& you stay in the house when the ghost killsssss, whhhhyyyyyyy?? I do a minimum to ID, and try to  stay in line with the front door.   Appearantly not functionally possible on higher skill levels. Explorative hunting:you get into more than me. The talk is relaxed but you all seem observant and experienced.-Ernie Moore Jr.
Man should collab with Mysni, the leading phasmophobia gamer
s
22:18 anyone else notice Wades voice gets a creepy quiet gargle undertone when he says "Drains your sanity"
i aint afraid of no ghost dew ni dew ni dew dew dew dew dew
The shadow in 11:07 is is dummy thick🤣
What is that song playing when he’s like BOOM BOOM BOOM in the intro?
5:18 got me
This is a scary game made 100% better by Mark and the boys
It will forever make me sad that Wade and Bob didn't react properly to Mark's "John Madden" reference. There over there listing off other football names whereas I'm over here like "FOOTBALL."
The way wade sacrafice himself haha no me lol
Never ceases to amaze me lol
I love it lol omg hes speaking to us lol
"Ghost orb on camera" had the same energy as Bumblebee Tuna from Ace Ventura 2
You saying "JoHn MaDdEn" Puts me on edge... my grandpa's name was John D Madden and he was one of the nicest, most southern person you'd ever met. Good memories. Sadly he passed about two and a half years ago, God bless his soul.
That crunch of the neck tho perfect neck crunch 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You did not just make me jumpscare to the Moon from Zelda ... :')
Wade: "the ghost can hear you when it's hunting"  Mark: screaming when the ghost is hunting
if anyone is wondering (like i was) the song at 10:55 is The Eternal War, Dream Cave
Its better if you 3 uses VR cause its fun and scary at the same time
Some of this ghost types are just the same meaning as ghost but different language.
I love to see more VR Phasmophobia.   Others in your party don't need to have VR in order to play together though.
🌚
Hantu is Indonesian Ghost Yokai is Japanese Ghost
hilarious how fast that door shut when the mirror cracked
I love how he got a high priestess fool card lol
"bob fight it!"  got me dyin bro
hey mark, I'm ur Indonesian subscriber, and "hantu" mean ghost in indonesian
13:03
Loved the intro
lixian 10/10. Always come here to see your work.
Famous last words: I don’t see anything on the camera, but it’s getting all glitchy. That’s a good sign right?
01:37 - Hide and seek world champion, 2021.
I always wonder when people will realise the gotta hide, be quiet and turn off flashlights during a hunt in order to survive
Phasmophobia is insane, hope you play more ☺️
You should play The Exorcist on the oculus VR. Had me absolutely shidding my pants the first time 😂
Mark so needs to do this in vr
SILENT BOB
These videos always make me laugh and smile!
21:50
i heard gohst writeing
*ghost is coming at Mark and camera starts flipping out*  Mark: “That’s a good sign right?!”  I died 😂
The fact he got high priestess during the hunt 😂🤦‍♀️
that moon freaked me out
Will you play the newer update?
Imagine the back pain these ghost hunters have!? 😂😂
don't pull cards while it's hunting because you got the high priestess and it was hunting so it was the fool and the high priestess revives a random dead player
I can't be the only one who thought the lady in the thumbnail was a bunny in an executioners mask
Omg yay you came back to the game!!!
just so everyone knows, every card turns to a fool card during a hunt
"Strange glowing lights. WHITE LADY" is the best newspaper clipping and nobody is allowed to deny it
Omg I just looked at the thumbnail after so long. I used to think it was a lama now I see it's an upside-down girl.
32:09 best HAHAHAHAHAHA
24:56 the meme
The first ghost was probably a Yokai, considering they had ghost orbs and it didn’t seem to track their flashlights too well
NO ONE NOTICED BOB IS LEVEL 1536?
am i crazy i see a 2 on marks forehead aa 6:48 foucs in his forehead and you'll see a 2
They can't stay quiet long enough to escape
31:23 he just missed cursed mirror
Wade: turn your light off, mean while bob turns it of and crouches in the middle of the room
I’m surprised they didn’t find slender man
LOL that Friday the 13th reference at the campsite XD (Jason's mask in the lake )
You should try play with insym too 👍❤️👋
HANTU is malaysian language for GHOST 🤣🤣🤣
5:18 i almost fell out of my chair even though i knew that it was going to be a jumpstare
horror games arent fun with headphones on new rule- DONT WEAR HEADPHONES AT MA VOLUME
Hello! 👋 I subscribed ur channel & laughing every ur jokes & vids.
Do you think the editors get scared a lot when they play games like this
Wade: when the ghost is hunting, it can hear us so stop talking. Mark: *loud austistic screeching*
it pretty weird when Wade was actually the one good at thing and in charge
I actually got a bit jumpscared when I first saw this 1:34
THE MOON JUMPSCARE OH MY GOD
Wade  kind of looks like Ryan Reynolds from free guy in this particular game
Them: its a little windy me: ITS LITERALLY FLOODING AND TORNADOS IN MY AREA
Wade don't touch grass. But he has damn good content
It's been years since I've seen a markiplier video and seeing that he's still playing with bob and wade almost made me cry. These guys have been together for the longest.
Dude he got the best and worst cards and it was all fake. wow
I love when the mirror breaks the doors slams and when it opens Bob is just dead 22:50 - 23:15
BRUH, MARKIPLIER DREW THE HIGH PRIESTESS WHILE THE HUNT WAS GOING ON. EVERY CARD TURNS INTO THE FOOL WHEN ITS HUNTING, THE HIGH PRIESTESS WOULD HAVE RESURRECTED BOB
High Priestess wasted during hunt that could have revived Bob. Also, hanged man waster during hunt which would have killed whoever drew it. All in all...yep. Good video, quite funny. Love to see more.
i love that they aren't doing anything besides identification, can they not stop the evil murderous apparitions, we''ll never know, because they don't try
Why the moon jump scare... I feckin sharted
Ate they aware that 25 times 3 is 75? Which is clearly more than 64.
Anytime I'm watching these group playthroughs, I remember that saying "If people observe you and your friends together and they DON'T question your sexuality, you're not really good friends."😅
19:10 why did this scare me so much💀
I didn't realize they the onryo, like the girl from the ring is one.
Fun fact: the Jason Mask (from Friday the 13th) Is just a neat little Easter egg that nods to the movie.
The cursed cards remind me of jojo
Moon jumpscare  Me: 😐 My soul: 💀💀
10:48
0:18 EYES
Hey guyz, imagine a mod being added withandela catalog stuff. Like the cams have the intruder on them when the ghost attacks and shit like that
dont u dare turn any moon into any kind of jump scare anymore please
there's a game on roblox that's almost the exact same as this called Specter lol
The blacklight in the lobby
Best intro ever!
the fact he warned us with the jump scare and i was still scared
8:20. CHRISSY WAKE UPPPP …. Hey … hello !!
If a guy dies have 2 thrpwable items to mean the ghost location and the go that way
The fact that the first ghost was a banshee meaning Wade's sacrifice was unnecessary is hilarious
You guys don't play this enough. I love watching the phasmophobia videos, game seems awesome. I'm the type of shitpants that will watch but won't touch this stuff 😂
Mark's refusal to ever hide, turn his light off, or be quiet to save himself is painful to watch. I'm just not sure if it's because he has walnut brain syndrome or if it's for the  c o n t e n t
H20 Delirious?!
I just got spammed by 20k tanks in my favorite game of all time by some asshole who wanted to do a funny ha ha, so, I came here and thought (after basically ruining a punching bag with a knife) I need some scary horror humor
Is it bad to feel stunt grab your leg?
There is a black light you can get in the lobby that you can shine on the walls and see things written on them 😋
Next on "Wade wastes his money on 2 idiots"....
*ahem* CAMPFIRE GUITAR GUY
The fact that I was looking up way too many by juice wrld and found this funny ahh video is funny as hell
Can anyone tell me what the reference at 24:37 is?
Hangman - Kills you immediately Wheel of fortune - Burns green = +25 sanity  /  Burns red = -25 sanity Devil - Manifestation Death - Triggers hunt Moon - Sets sanity to 0 Sun - Sets sanity to 100  Hermit - Doesn't allow the ghost to roam Fool - Looks like a normal but then reveals itself and wastes a card Tower - Forces activity Priestess - Revives a dead teammate
the moon one actually scared me
mark farted #16:19
The moon jump scare got me.
I hate and love that the newer episodes have turned such a scaryass game into a hilarious clown fiesta. Damn you, Mark and co.!  xD
at 3:04 the person on the right farted took a shit lol
"THROWTHECOFFEECUPINIT'SGENERALDIRECTION" god i love this man lmao
that first one is the banshee-est banshee ever
We can play together? U have Discord for your fan players?
in capsite on nightmare mode you can see slenderman in the woods and jack the killer in the water oh yeah and theres a blair witch logo
5:17 hells yeah.... It's The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask Moon!!!!
duuuude I been waitin on this  "YOURE ON YOUR OWN MARK"
Love that intro.
The fact that Mark drew the High Priestess AND the Hanged Man, without him realising how rare they are and both were the fool astounds me
The fact thst he could revive Bob he decided to pull and he did not know but i think pulling cards makes only the fool
Best intro in cinematic history!
can anyone tell me what the reference Mark made at 24:35?
Alternate title: Mark and friends discover that shooting a porno at a haunted house has the ghost laughing too hard to kill
I literally love your fan base
Markiplier next time y'all play phamsmphobia go back to the camp site map and than cut the campfire on, after that look at the right area of the Blaire witch totem in the woods you will see a secret you will find cool and creepypasta
One of the funniest videos ever
i love watching this while crocheting :)
16:35 Mark missed the perfect chance to say "like me"
Mark : It's over ghost I activate my trap card the fool that means I activate more than once making me survive multiple turns             RIP Kazuki Takahashi
11:04 15:16 17:18
farted so loud
Why does the guy in the brown jacket look like Shane Madej???
With the first ghost. Actually kinda scared. Shut. Up
Does anyone else hear what sounds like someone screaming at 23:44?
For those of you who don't know, "the Tower" card is associated with destruction. One time at the haunt I work at, one of my friends was doing tarot readings and she did a reading about the haunting weekend and she IMMEDIATELY drew The Tower.
Ghost Exile next?
The fun part is, I played this game so much that I identified the ghost in the first game just by the hunt... Just sad we didn't get to see what ghost is actually was...
Phasmophobia my beloved
The fact that mark got a high prestis and hanged man but during hunts kinda ticks me off
17:57 wade looks like he's breaking his back lol
The speed of walking for this game is almost as slow as the speed for running in my nightmares 😅😂
Yummy Game
*beeeeeeeeeeeeep*  Mark -> “oooooooooooooooh”
Whoever your editor is... You're not paying them enough.
John Madden holy shi-
Bro pulled a HP and a HM little did he know what they did lucky and unlucky  it was hunting ahahahha
32:12   that death scream🤣
I'm surprised nobody referenced Distractible when they were facing the Hantu ghost...lol
Mark: Doesn't stop drawing cards. The cards: "You fool"
Im very confused how you could be well over level 1000 but know little to nothing about the game and objects 😅 HACKER
So sad, Bob would have come back if he hadnt drawn the high priestess while it was hunting :(
You guys playing the silly little ghost game gives me serotonin >:D
im leaving a comment for future me as a reminder that some of these moments are animation worthy  especially the making Wade twerk in front of cam 04 in the bedroom XD
How is he that hight of a level
"it's heckin' wimdy out here, boys!" my favorite fucking quote
Bob sure does luv dying.
They should all do this in vr
no but how did you actually survive those hunts just standing in the open
If you think that's scary, try out Ghost Exile instead, it's supposedly scarier than Phasmophobia
oh I love watching you play this game!
I love your vids
Lixian is like a genie. He has all the power at his fingertips, able to change reality in an instant, but he can only do as Mark commands.
im gonna make a reference!!! they found a hantu tatek. hehehe.
20:00
Hope you guys keep playing this game.
In Indonesia Hantu means Ghost
Wade getting himself killed so that Mark would be all alone was pretty funny.
Soooo my friend got me with the closet scare. Lol
Mark the ghost knows where you are if you're electronics are on. So you need to cycle off the camera when it's hunting.
everyone's talking about the tarot cards but no one's talking about the bedroom scene in the second hunt
Do you agree with 👻???
There should be a second game or second aspect to the game, where you are the ghost removal team. You could have to remember how to prepare for each type of ghost. I think that would be rather cool.
care for another tarot card reading goood sir? they are done for free and you get a sandwich.
is no one gonna talk about the weird stuff that happen between 18 to 22 minutes?? Like I have no words
MARKIPLIERRRRRRRR
Me expecting a good jumpscare. Me still getting terrified at the moon…
BRUH THERE'S TRIPPLE ADDS WTH
30:23 was that jason voorhees
Tarot cards: *exist in Phasmophobia*  Me: *”I AM THOU, THOU ART I”*
I like how at the campsite, Mark is only using a video camera. It’s like those found footage movies😁
Two hangman’s and one high priestess that’s really rare
The moon jumpscare made me jump.
best intro😂😂😂😂😂😂
Seeing mark *waste* a high priestess D:
I wounder if anyone made a ghost go away playing this game burping or farting
Wade: Okay when the haunt begins the ghosts can hear you now, so we have to be very quiet Mark: I have never been quiet in my life and I don’t plan to start now
lord minion is level 1536 :0
Y'ALL is that a SPACE W/ MARKIPLIER reference?!?!?!?!!??!?!?!!?!?!!??!?!?!?
26:00
I love how Wade just pushed them into the deep end with professional lmfao
I so want that tarot deck
32:12 why is this the funniest part of the whole vid💀💀💀
yk i dont think he knows how to sprint
Mark and the deck of many things would be great.  "If I keep pulling something good is bound to happen!"
HE FINALLY PLAYED IT
Holy shit wade is level 1000+ damn
Like how Wade didn't show Mark the Slenderman easter egg
The moon actually scared me
made on my birthday wow
They need to add more than one ghost in a mission for the hardest difficile lmao
The way wade just walked in front of mark took his place an dsaid ur on ur own now mark and died right after that😂
i cant with Markiplier And Bob-  17:22
How many times does Mark have to be told that the ghost can hear you while it's hunting before he stops screaming when the ghost is hunting.
At the campsite map, they were dealing with the Blair witch! That is her calling card
Hey Markiplier can you play Friday the 13th: the game
That thumbnail looks lile a goat wearing a wig
the moon jump scare was from legends of zelda majora's mask thats crazy
Bob did the Crissy Crumble
airpods make this so scary to watch  1:08 scared the shi outta me
“Man I gotta do some cardio”  The soccer ball that came out of nowhere; “Am I a joke to you?”
Someone, somewhere out there plays this game with their mother. "MOOOM GET THE CAMERA"
I've stayed in the Ritz-Carlton before.. nice place
my only conclusion, when you drew all the cards? the ghost hurt itself in YOUR confusion.
"did you get my messages from beyond?" no I think they got caught in my spam filter
The part where they kept drawing cards and it consistently Turned into the fool was kinda funny The fool means new beginings/the start of a Journey They could at least use the tower  tower being "everything is/was/is going to get fucked" (No hate to anyone who made the game, I just personaly found it funny)
32:12 🤣
Wade: hates horror games the most out of the bunch  Also Wade: knows more about every horror game than the rest put together
Wade's level compared to the other guys is hilarious.
What's the music at 10:55?
"No me, your on your own know Mark." and then dies. Petfect that was so funny.
You drew a high priestess during the hunt, that would have revived bob…
It's back
i like how mark drew 2 of the rarest cards in the game that could’ve both saved bob and ended himself in one hunt
More rath
Sure has been a while, its great to see what's new considering its been a long ass since I played Phasmo myself, also, anyone know the music at 10:54?
I think I'm an idiot. What's the 'Howdy Camper' thing from?
I can't be the only one who thinks bob's character looks like Shane Madej
24:54 all you see is from Bob to SUDDENLY SHELF
8:39 JoJo reference
I'm starting to wonder whether Mark intentionally talked and left his flashlight on so the ghost COULD find him...
When they were talking about raiju I thought they were talking about the Pokémon raichu
24:55 is me 24/7 anytime someone tries explaining anything to me
Wade: If the ghost is hunting and you talk at all apparently it can hear you, find you and kill you  Mark every time the ghost is hunting: URGAAAAAAAAAH AAAAAH AAAAAAAH!!!
9:12 you got VERY LUCKY there
Bob kinda sounds like ranboo..
How the hell did Mark survive
Just so you know, the eyeballs up over the lobby are not new, they have been in the game a long time :)
24:55 is way too funny to me lmao
I like how there’s just a type of ghost called “Hantu” in that game, while it’s just the Malay and Indonesian word for ghost.
they didnt play this game for like a year and then forgot their usual strategy
I love this series
Hantu means ghost in Malaysia lol. nice
Howdy campers ---- crying :(((( XD
After waiting for 9-10 months. They finally make a new video about this game I've been waiting for it in forever.
Mark: make the moon into a jumpscare  me: its gonna be like before its probably fin- HOLY FRICK
mark u think i can play a game wit u in my birthday 😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Wade just doing everything Mark and Bob was telling him to do.
JASON VORHEES IN THE LAKE HE DIED IN A LAKE THATS HIS MASK I LOVE THAT
In this episode, mark and bob make Wade a star ⭐
1:34  and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
mark drew so many cards he had enough fools to live
1:07 - 1:09 hearing that in vr makes you shit your pants
When I first look at it, I thought is a rabbit wearing a mask, oh but its just a ghost upside down.
Lixian’s jumpscare actually got me
The cards remind me of the tarot cards from Jojo's bizarre adventures.... and the stands like Hermit purple and The Fool.
Imagine a fnaf crossover
11:00 the funniest sequence
Lol this was fun and spooky
Are we not gonna talk about the song at 17:48
Not sure if it’s been said, but you can actually  put a camera on the tripod in the truck and carry it that way. That way you can bring two cameras in at once, one on the tripod and one in your hand. You just have to hold the tripod first and if you switch tools it will drop the tripod wherever you are and wherever you’re facing. Keep doing your best. 😁
More more more!
i love how no comments are made about wades level Edit: nvm had paused the video 2 seconds to early
** 😊😊**
17:30 lol
Well, "Hantu" actually means ghost in Malay
You guys should play this together in VR
Please do more of this game. It's hilarious
Hey Mark, these are what the tarot cards do:  Hangman - Kills you immediately Wheel of fortune - Burns green = +25 sanity  /  Burns red = -25 sanity Devil - Manifestation Death - Triggers hunt Moon - Sets sanity to 0 Sun - Sets sanity to 100  Hermit - Doesn't allow the ghost to roam Fool - Looks like a normal but then reveals itself and wastes a card Tower - Forces activity Priestess - Revives a dead teammate
What do the ghosts have against Bob??!!? 🤣
Mark and bob pervin on wade is my new favorite thing
I got trapped in a corner by a mimic the other day, it kept walking around me and humming and groaning in a hunt for like fifteen minutes before I tried to escape. I gotta tell ya, the mimic is by far one of the scariest encounters I've had in this game, and I was playing on intermediate.
I just got back to back 15 unskippable and then less than a second of the video played and I got back to back 15 second unskippable again.
24:50 When Bob
5.2k
hmm the conjuring 2 boy 1:52
Markiplier: *dying*  The boys: tried to throw a cup at you mark.
Wade is level 1,500 dude
I love how eagerly Wade dives into the great beyond. "Hah!  ME!"
What was that music playing when Bob or Wade or whoever died? I kinda wanna listen to it
5:14 Dang the moon got me. Lol XD
Sincerely hope this means more Phasmo
Mark placed the camera in the worst possible locations
I think the guys have never one a single match lol
it's back!!!!!
Wade’s sacrifice was the best thing I’ve ever seen. The emotions and the timing were just [chef’s kiss]
I like how Mark draw the card is like playing Yu Gi Oh.
So funny the ghost type is "Hantu" which literally mean "Ghost"  in Indonesian 🤣🤣🤣
i cannot play scary games, full stop, and i have no idea why i find the suffering of these young men so gd entertaining 😩
No, me!  That's right, you're on your own now Mark   *Suddenly being strangled*  Best moment this go around
You can put the video on the tripod and carry the tripod with 2 other items for 4 items total.
30:26 I love how they added Jason Voorhees' mask😆
I see mark is a professional at drawing cards now he shares his ways of drawing card to bob just keep drawing them
Wade sacrificing himself to try and save Mark was sweet, even if it was a fiasco
Wish they had seen Slenderman in the woods.
Bob: "where are you?" My immediate reaction: "and I'm so sorry"
Okay, can we just acknowledge that super seamless animation in the intro?? Damn Lixion, on your A-game, I see.
so, i go camping semi-regularly, and that "tent for their stuff" is a little 25 dollar self-pitching tent you can get online lol
"Is that the 'Death cup' or the 'Go there' cup?" lol I legit died as I watched Mark second guess Bob and Wade's intentions of leading him astray. lol
I hope they do more. this is my favorite series it makes me smile
11:00 man died a hero, and in the funniest way
YEAHHHH NEW PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEO
He used the moon from Majoras Mask and it still scared me
They didn’t find slender man out in the woods, disappointing
you should play with insym
I'm so happy that you revisted phasmo, it's honestly such a cool game! Hope you guys come back for the next update too!!
"This isn't a democracy, this is a dict-Wade-orship!" Wade, probably, circa 2022
Healthy reminder that “smudging” is a closed practice. Native Americans have asked not to mock their sacred ceremonies and practices because of trends in recent media. People who use white sage are being strongly advise to research as to why you shouldn’t use it for cleansing practices. It is very unethical. If you need a new word for “smudge sticks” use “cleansing sticks”. There is a lot of emotion and pain that goes into smudging now a days. We should not be using it as a commercial used to cleanse your house and or use it for the smell. (Also there is a very similar reasons to not use Palo Santo)
i like how the camera says 4k but shooots 1080p
Ever notice that Mark Bob and Wade are the only people who throw stuff as ghosts to communicate?
OMG you played it again! 😎 You need to play more phasmophobia with Jack and wade and stuff! I loved your phasmophobia videos from 2020 and I died laughing. That's why I bought phasmophobia, because of you! Seriously though you should make more phasmophobia videos they're funny as fuck! 🤣
I like how Wade didn't tell Mark anything about how to survive hunts
Bob: *draws only one card* Ghost: And I took that personally
I couldn't help but scream when Mark was drawing cards during the Hunt. He drew a High Priestess! He could have brought back Bob!
24:50 I know what you are talking about!
5.4k
Look out the sides to see another reference in the campsite map
We're not gonna talk about how they didn't know the mask reference in the lake?
Shed tent? Tentshed? Shent???
lol for having a lvl over 1500 he sure plays like a newb
Wades level is astounding 🤣
Mark really was relying on the heart of the cards
The moon bro what a jumpscare
"Mark I think it killed you"
The moon jump scare at the beginning did get me
bob throwing the cup around made me laugh so much more than expected from a horror game
Wade: this is a safe space Mark: *and I took that personally*
You guys should’ve done this one in VR he’s fix a lot of the bugs in that mode and it’s way scarier
That 1st ghost was calling you a fool, Mark. I wouldn't take that if I were you!
Oooo
"You have to be really quiet when its hunting"   Mark  :  talks non stop while its hunting out of fear
Mark: Judges Wade's level Me and any other loser who has played way too much of this game: *slides away*
I love how Wade just jumps in and goes "You're on you own now!" and sounds like he's throwing up a verbal middle finger as he dies
8:48 - I think the game's trying to tell you you're dumb, Mark :P
7:16 - I thought that was a smartphone with a cracked screen at first
Vr is the only way to play this game
That's a lot of fun. I really, really like watching this game. Couldn't ever play it myself, but watching is fun xD
Mark kinda look like Chris McLean from total drama
5:18
Who is bumbum
When he drew the high priestess while it was hunting, broke my heart for poor Bob a little xD
Mark: sees cards kill Bob Also Mark: starts frantically drawing cards
the moon part actually scared me
Mark: What card did he draw..? Death..?  [Mark draws the ever-so-terrifying Death card]  Mark: IVEGOTBADNEWSIVEGOTBADNEWSAAAAAAAA  ==TO BE CONTINUED==>
The camping map
You can see slender man some where in the map
Wade *acts like a Dictator* Also wade: Calls it Democratic
YES please play this more :') I love this game and you trio in it so much
why did the moon jumpscare make me jump i played fnaf 4 full screen and that scared me of all things :D
The ominous "it's here" scared the daylights out of me. I forget how much I hate horror games and how good of a game Phasmaphobia is
Does this game have real locations? Like Winchester Mystery Manor, or the Shanghai Tunnels.
Mark needs to stop saying "Lixian turn ____ into a jumpscare!" My heart cannot take this
Dude, I actually sneezed at 1:09 in time with the sneeze noise. It was like I knocked off his headphones.
Sorry if I'm uncultered but what was Mark referencing at 25:04 ?
When Mark wasted the High Priestess.
Mark: *Casually says hi and that's weird to floating mask*   Me: HOLY SHIT ITS JASON VORHEES
17:10
12:04
25:10 was that a reference to ISWM??
Watching this, I think we should have Mark and the boys play Unfortunate Spacemen.
Lmaaaaaaaao the way wade screamed when he was killed towards the end,took me absolutely the fuck out 😂😂😂😂😂
Bob: the ghost is hunting you with a meat cleaver Me: guru Herald???
A lot of the game features discussed in the van for the first investigation have been around long before this recent update. But regardless, still a really entertaining performance, great job guys :D
19:33
Omg!!! I love when they play. They haven't played in like a year!
27:40 IVE HAD NIGHTMARES ABOUT THIS EXACT STICK THING  WHAT THE HELL
Ngl the moon jump scare actually caught me off guard lol
Anyone else have a little heart attack when the moon jumpscare happened?
I haven't played this game in well over a year. I would only ever play it in VR - same with the two friends I would play back and forth with. After over a year of updates I decided to give this game a try again with one of those same friends just to check out what's new. I'll tell you what's new - SHITS FUCKIN TEN TIMES SCARIER THAN IT USED TO BE. We kept getting caught by the ghost cuz our vocal asses kept trying to call out to each other and screaming during hunts and a couple of the maps we thought we knew were either totally new maps or have been changed. Not to mention a new tool got added and more ghost types were brought in + different ghost models. Feels like playing the game for the first time all over again! Love it but goddamn don't even know if I wanna go back lol
can someone tell me what they were referencing when talking about camp?
i’ve been waiting for this one TURN IT UP
4:38
16:08 Well said Mark. A true poet.
I never stopped playing the game after their first playthroughs, and it's hilarious seeing how behind they are.
Why was that first hunt so funny.
Wade literally throws himself in front of Mark to save him, the least competent phasmophobia player here
...Of all the times Lixian actually put a jumpscare in, he did it where we LEAST EXPECTED IT
Mark, I just want to thank you. I have been struggling with school, motivation and depression but after watching Iswm, I became aware of how much work you put into that amazing project and it inspired me to work harder. Because of you, I am graduating. Because of you, I mustered up the strength to push on when I felt too tired to work. Thank you for being there for us. It is truly amazing thinking back on how much your channel grew as we grew. I know this is quite random but I wanted to let you know of the positive impact you have on your viewers.
So nobody noticed that soccer ball get kicked at mark from the darkness on the campsite level?
He face-planted lolol
How do I get out of Walmart???
Did anyone else think that that scare at 1:08 was a ghost sneezing lol
i’d love for them to pick up playing this game again! always a blast to watch
PLEASE do more phasmophobia i love it so much
Lixian I do not appreciate how good that moon jump scare was.
5:22 I HATE LIFE
Watch from 32:05 on if you want to actually laugh out loud 😂
Great job in the intro, Lixian 😂😂
Yay, its back
I think the scariest part of the campsite is that someone left their toothbrush just laying on that gross AF public sink.
i miss the "helloooo everybody, my name is Markiplier" intro
Please do more! I beg!
Perfectly windy,  that's the way i like it😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The stock ghost effect killed me
MOREEEEE
27:41 . Don’t know if it was sarcasm but that literally is the totem from Blair Witch. It’s possibly just an egg, a nod to the movie by the creators of Phasmaphobia, or probably just for ornamental purposes
Level 64 level 25 level 1,536
freezing temps out side at night must be a ghost
Wen mark was pullin the tarot cards y were they becomin jokers after evry pull
I dont  know if anyone noticed but the totem is the same one used in the blair witch movies
Goddamn. Wade with the self sacrifice.
How did mark survive pulling so many bad cards
you forgot to say "Hello Everybody My name is Markiplier"
this series has gotta be one of my top favorites. I love these three (also including jack)
love the tarot cards hahah
Wade jumping in front of the ghost kills me every time lmao
level 1500... wade must be a hacker in GTA online
That secret ghost in the beginning scared the absolute shit out of me
Come on guys, even the JITS guys are better than you 😂
"MAKE THE MOON INTO A JUMP SCARE" I actually shat myself
the first half is giving me goosebumps! it's not helping that I'm watching this in the dark 🙃
i don't get the "Howdy camper" reference.
and it doesnt matter if u are pressing the talk button during a hunt it can still hear u
please keep playing this game I still remember the vids from when this game first came out
15:08 The ghost and I have very similiar names...
Why is no one talking about the ISWM reference? 🥹
YESSS I WAS WAITING FOR THEM TO GET THE JASON EASTER EGG
8:28
Love this content please make more
Mark: Turn the moon into a jumpscare! Me: ok jumpscAAAAHJESUSFUCK
25:43  FOOTBALL! aeiou aeiou aeiou
32:10 is me in gym class😂
Bruh it was the beginning of the video and I soul left my body 1 but 2 times😭😭
The Jason mask was kind of funny
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Please mark, play more of this game cause its fucking hilarious
The moon jumpscare actually made me throw my phone😭
YESSS! I love this series so much and im glad its back!!!
The trouble with watching you play is your audience is going to get the idea that this game is  impossible and not try it out. Actively hurting the game by not learning a bit of the game
One of the times that my friend and I played phasmo our ghost did absolutely nothing and it prioritised taking a shower over anything else. Not hunting no nothing just MUST CLEAN!
Of all the dynamics of this friend group, I will always love the dynamic that, on a random occasion, in a random play-through, Wade will be sexualized XD
Lmfaooo🤣🤣 how they made Wade basically give them a lap dance💀💀💀 bish I'm fuggen deaddd Edit: lmao  Wade: I CAN'T SPRINT!! MAAAARKKK!! UGHNNHHNNNNGHHH
mark we need more of phasmo
they need to check out slender man in the forest on the camp map
Did Mark joke about SA?
Lixian, turn the moon into a jumpscare, lol
Mark tries to draw Exodia and survives. Bob draws Blue Eyes White Dragon and gets killed instantly.
That was awesome It made me really laugh nicely You are all very entertaining
ooooh i notice mark edited out the wind comment
While watching this video my ears started ringing and I was so invested in the video at first I was like “Lixian is editing this video really well. True ambiance.”
fun to watch
Mark can you please make more videos like this it's really funny to watch!
Mark: Bob throw the cup were the ghost is!  Bob: ‘throws the cup in front of mark’ Mark: that’s not good.   That’s the part that got me.
Bro those are tarot cards it’s a jojo reference
Mark: *dies terrible death* Bob: Mark, I think he killed you. Also Bob: Mark, did you get my messages from beyond?
why the editing music? it's overdramatic...
Where do I get a random cup flying around giving guidance in my life
this game is still by far the most scary ive played lmao
Is phasmophobia from indo or malay ??
-¿Bob? -¿Wade?
Love how mark tried to bring back the John Madden thing!
Gotta love lixians edits
I never expect them to actually win this game, i just expect them to mess around and die.
I want to see The Winchesters play this game haha
Bruh the fact he pulled high priestess and hangman but it was both fools because a hunt was happening is such an L and how he didnt react to either of those godly tarrot cards
Where's Jack
Boys: Is it a hantu?  Me, a Distractible gremlin: Tetek??
It's so painful to watch Mark play this when you have more than 50h on this game but it also is HILARIOUS 😂😂
Mark: *already dead, seeing the ghost fingers* Bob (I think, I wasn't paying much attention) "I think it killed you."
Mark trying to open the gate, seeing the ghost, and then desperately trying to open the gate before dying was a real horror movie moment.
hurts watching Mark standing there and not hiding.
The part with the Tarot Cards was the funniest 7:50
Mark got many fools
fuck yeah love these guys
the mooon scared the shit out of me
yes
I really wanna play this game with mark so that i can teach him tricks, which would be funny if he knew what he was doing and wade didnt know he has gained experience off hand
No jk the moon s ared the f out of me
Turn the moon into a jumpscare~ Fuckyuu Jajsvhwvqhsg
Hantu just means ghost in Malay lol Yurei is just Japanese for ghost too lol
both mark and bob.
What was the song playing when wayde died to the first ghost?
fianlly more phas
It’s about to get updated again too with 2 new ghosts, and I think they are shrinking asylum as well. A new map is in the works too. Lots of exciting stuff!
8:50 >.< SADGE almost revived bob XD
I believe the game has reached peak gaming. Boutta spend money on it :))))
Aha! *Found a JoJo reference in Phasmophobia!*
the moon jumpscare actually scared the living shit out of me
Best moon jumpscare ever
I am so happy that this is back I really love this game❤️
What's funny, is that in Tarot, Death isn't a bad card at all.  Tower would be the closest to being a bad card to draw.
Why did Lixian's majora moon jumpscare actually get me, even though it was two seconds after Mark actually said it 😭
I kinda want you to reach out to Insym and have him take you ghost hunting. He's really good at the game... and it's fun to see him flip from "I'm about to do some crazy shit" to "now is science and teaching time"
If you draw cards during a hunt they will all turn into Fools.  Fool cards are basically "ha ha nothing happened"
I call the garage ghost "Sally" and I persist in believing she's the ghost that they have helping train people and who resurrects players that die after they get back to the garage.
24:55 what is that theme?!?!
yo
FINALLY MORE MARK & FRIEND'S GHOSTBUSTERS!! PLEASE MAKE MORE AND ADD JACKSEPTICEYE
This has to be marks funniest video ever hahaha
I like the Jason reference
*Ghost is about to kill mark* Wade: No! Me! *Steps in path* You're on you're own now, Mark. Mark: What? Why?? Wade: *starts convulsing*
That moon. You bastard.
wade: IM HERE FOR YOU MARK UR NOT ALONE few seconds later... wade: ''dies'' mark: ohh no. LMAOO
@28:43 the serendipity thing Mark mentioned in Distractible  happened and the light blew up.
THE SOUND AFFECT WHEN THE SKELETON  FELL🤣IM DONE🤣
🤣 I missed this series so much
Wow, very entertaining, but seriously... Mark really has _no idea_ how to play this game. 🤣
i just startet playing this agin today and i was so scard the the first hunt begun that i just left the game XD
More Phas please
YES! I love this game and when you guys play it it gets so much funnier! I just got serotonin -wink wink-
Funniest thing is that if Mark waited to continue drawing after the hunt, Bob would have been revived
So.... we know now, from experience, that Mark is the Last Girl???
10:55 enardos zerg.
i wanna know what the first ghost was
I'm glad to see you taking ghosts on again 😂
PLZ play more! i am an old participant btw.
“Get good, don’t suck, do it right” -My friend at the sight of my failure
I hope he does more phasmophobia the game gets a lot more fun when you get good at it
I just realized that the cards are now a Jojo Reference
HE GOT HIGH PRIESTESS. BUT IT WAS HUNTING SO IT DIDNT WORK. feels bad
How tf did mark not die in that first hunt
i love the cup being thrown as mark as you already see him dying, i was HOPING to see that and i was not disappointed xD
Mark-"Turn the moon into a jump scare" Me-"Oh god the majoras mask moon that actually used to scare me"
what do you get when you replace d in dock with c
I don't know why I found it so funny when Bob died and they tookhis picture with his head in the plant right next to the kitty picture. lol
Hantu is ghost in malay
You should definitely play in VR, it would be crazy!
...did anyone else get the In Space With Markiplier reference?-
Need more of this for my mental health
Mark: Howdy camper Me: I cut the yellow wire
Shiit, i missed this video!
omg LMFAO watching someone use the  tarot cards  as someone who actually understands  them is so fucking funny
just imagine the ghost watching wade, just...
I  seriously  love this  new  update,  it  is  so  creative  and  it  makes  it  much  scarier  for  experience.  So  unplanned  on  what  everything  happened  and  I  rather  enjoy  when  the  light  flickers  more  dramatically,  really  settles  discomfort  for  you  knowing  that  you’re  going  to  die.
Love these
I'd really like to see these guys properly learn how to play the game. Theres so many new things and functions that make the game so much more fun!
Day 1 of asking u to do a cover on Maria
that moon... why mark
… Excuse me Wade, what is your current level?!
Everything I understand about Phasm makes it very confusing on how mark lived for so long in that first game.
Check the lockers
Was that a refrence for in space with mack😂
the moon jumpscare lowkey kinda scared the shit outts me
1:08 i straight up thought that was just my brother yelling from across the house for a minute
thanks! i'm totally screaming, crying and laughing watching this! such shenanigans hahaha
I love this game with you guys
mark loves his beans
John madden
from the video i can tell that the ghost is Banshee.
My friend and I played just after the cursed objects update and while I was looking around he found the music box. He opened it and chucked it on the ground like a damn grenade before gunning it out of the house. I was not a happy ghost.
1:23 My friend convinced me to go to that room.
I wish I have frends to play this T-T
Moon
Mark saying “John Madden” over and over again while Bob and Wade don’t realize what it’s referencing… felt 😔
Idk if anyone has mentioned this Mark... but you can place the camera on the tripod without needing to take up 2 spaces for your inventory. I normally grab flashlight, a 2nd item and the camera and a tripod combo! (VR gameplay you get a 4th possible)
The effects have gotten way better, but the content has gotten way worse...
Campsite: is mentioned Mark: time to quote in space with markiplier 2
You guys have to play more of this!!!!!!
Was about to go to bed but saw this
holy moly this game is way more scarier with this update. Now this is a horor game
24:36 - 24:56 sent me
God dammit. The spooky “hey” at the beginning got me😅
Coffee Cup Bob is my new favorite character of the MCU (Mark Cinematic Universe)
24:53-24:57 had me whEEZING DUDE ISTG
The moon jumpscare literally got me lmfao
7:46 ghost flies in corner💀😂
I agree!!!
I would love for Markiplier to do an investigation with Ghost Adventures. 👻
Love it when you do this game
30:26 H20Delirious is taking a swim
Mark "turn the moon into a jumpscare"  Me-actually dies
I loved the intro LMAO. I think all of Mark's intros should be like that
I’ve honestly grown to love Lixian, especially in their interactions.
*Pounding fists on table*✊🏻 more phasmophobia ✊🏻 more phasmophobia ✊🏻 (please)
32:09 I've found Wade's Defense Mechanism: Aggressive Pitbull noises
Man props for the editors making mark's intro that consists of explosion sounds come to life in such an awesome way gotta appreciate the work they put in these videos wouldn't be the same without them a little thank you from a random fan
No one gonna mention how Mark was just...mesmerized with the dancing in the camera?
There are slenderman and Jason easter eggs at the campsite
When there 30 minutes break and I’m trying to finish the video, but there 20 ad that take 2 minutes per ad in the video.
If you select the camp map and go to the stick figure on the fence and look out in the tree-line you will find slenderman
I am confused about the howdy camper part ngl
wait did they change how the tarot cards work? cause HOW DID MARK GET THE FOOL EVERY TIME
4:46 anomonous? lol
I'm so happy! Bob, Mark, and Wade are playing together again! I have been listening to distractible but watching them play games together is so refreshing for some reason.
24:48 - 24:57 got me good, actually made me chuckle a bit haha
“Hantu” is Ghost in my native language for anyone that’s curious.
As someone who is level 1000+ this is both very funny and very frustrating lol
when mark pulled the tower card, MY HEART DROPPED TO MY FUCKING FEET
You should try to use the fluorescent light, used for fingerprints, when you're in the starting area (the garage). You might see some interesting things.... Also, you probably wanna look up into the attic when you're in the garage.....
The most tragic thing is mark drawing a high priestess card while the ghost is hunting and it turning into a fool :D
Feels bad that Mark drew the High Priestess card while it was hunting. It would have brought a dead player back to life. Anything you draw during a hunt becomes a Fool card, which means it doesn't work.
I was gonna say "Death actually isn't that bad of a card to draw" and then Mark drew The Tower and basically those two in the same draw is kind of the worst ever so never mind
the way they joke around making poses for the cameras without a single laugh just sends me😂
Fun fact: Maple lodge campsite is named after CJ’s cat, maple. CJ is the lead artist of phasmo
Imagine they add like bees nests and other natural objects that can kill them XD
Wade: What card did he draw? Mark: Death? Proceeds to actually draw a card that says death lmao
MOOOORE MARK MOOOORE OF PHASMO BABYYY
I love how mark caused the most chaos by constantly drawling cards and yet was the last one standing😭
they said hantu perfectly.
We need more phasmaphobia
Bro, i knew the moon jump scare was coming but i still got me
I love that marketplier is bring back his old outro!
Mark : *Howdy Camper!* Me: I-Is that an ISWM reference!?!?
i wish we could see their facees tooooo
8:42 is that a JoJo reference?
Wade sacrificing himself was truly hilarious and beautiful at the same time
I laughed entirely too hard when Mark & Bob had Wade put on a show in front of the camera.💀💀💀
3:54 am I the only one that read that as “Jim” and not “Jinn” I was like “goddamn phasmophobia you’re not that desperate for new content, are you??”
😂🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me or is there no sound? Every other video I play is fine except this one....
Love the ISWM reference.
we need more big markimilkers
Lol, gotta be quiet during a hunt. Dies anyone not SCREAM when being hunted? We're all doomed to die.
Its really unique to see "hantu" as a type of ghosts while in Indonesian, Hantu is ghost. Maybe it would make sense if they put "Kuntilanak" or "genderuwo" instead
MARK! I am saying this because we love your content, wife and I that is. You are missing out on one of the best ghost hunting games i have ever seen. Look up GHOST EXILE, and thank us later! Looking forward to seeing the content. :P
You know it bares the question: In regard to the character models make-up, they clearly have a set of teeth and a tongue, a fully functioning mouth designed. Yet the mouths, do not open or function. Why go to the trouble? Is this something that is unfinished or abandoned? Is it strictly for the purpose of building a functional character model for the game? I must be missing something.
Mark always dies last lol
I'm so happy you brought phasmo back😀😀😀
Haven’t seen the trio since the fnaf gmod map
Wade sounds like Rick Sanchez over the radio😂
You should try playing phasmophobia on VR!
Holy shit, a high priestess during the hunt AND the final card being a hanged man but switching to the fool... holy shit, Mark just played roulette and the gun fuckin jammed.
I'm not quite sure, but I think that house might be haunted.
I hope they make more now that there are a lot of new updates! Especially trying nightmare 😂 bringing Seán into it as well just seems even more fun
God that ending where the ghost just walked out of the darkness on the camera was so good
AEIOU
Wade really stopped the chaos and said “NO. ME.” And he got what he wanted. What an icon
how did he live so long
"turn the moon into a jump scare"  me: *jumps out of my bed*
FUCKING ZELDA MOON
He wasted all the cards🤨😑😑😑😑😑
This new update is so cool! Please play more!
Hey a Cursed item. Let's play around with it when we are hunting a ghost that can probably kill us. Makes sense in videogames, but still "Why?", IRL.
Now i wanna play it again :D
GODDAMMIT LIXIAN THE MOMENT I THINK YEAH I KNOW WHEN HE’LL ACTUALLY PUT A JUMPSCARE YOU PROVE ME WRONG EVERYTIME 🫥
This game is always so fun to watch them play.
25:55 football!
Nice moon scare. It's from my favorite game ever.
No but someone tell me how Bob throwing the cup in front of Mark while the ghost was hunting was actually really fucking scary
is nobody gonna talk about Wade in the room😂😂
I hope Lixian makes six figures for this prestige editing.
ok for the longest time i thought the cover of the video was a goat with a powdered wig-
Bob: Picks up cursed mirror and walks into the house Door closes Wade: Well now hes dead
Wade's scream before he died omg
More phasmaphobia pls
Thank you for uploading more phasmaphobia videos. I really adore them, and many people have not been active on YouTube, so it is a pleasure for being entertained.
Mark: MOON!! Lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare...  Me: (Not knowing what he just said) dead*
Mark you can put the video camera on the tripod then just carry the tripod instead of holding them separately :D
I want to know what the camp reference is
I watched this 7 days after it was uploaded...Ringu?
Those UI options are so awesome.
He really did the john madden, john madden aeiuo aeiou
I love this line from the wiki about dealing with The Mimic, “best way to beat The Mimic is pretend that it has the ability of every ghost at once”
20:30 the sussy special?!
"Mark, did you hear my messages from beyond?"😂
“Lixian! Make the moon do a jumpscare!”  Me : “This will be some stupid looking jump sc- OH JESUS!”  Edit: 1000 likes. Nice! 👍🏻
Mark, might I reccomend researching what each Tarot card does cause you just pulling all the cards during a hunt means that you ain’t gonna get anything from them
With the cameras you can put them on the tripod and hold the tripod with night vision on. Then you can walk around with your flashlight off and look through the camera for ghost orbs in different rooms. 😊  And for mimics. The only ghosts that can be a mimic is a hantu and onryo.  Hantu: all 3 evidence + spirit box Onryo: all 3 evidence + finger prints
You gotta play more of this!!!
16:09 sad Mario noises
The ghost: *Trying to kill us* Me: "Where is my Death Note? *WHERE IS IT?!"*
Bob +Mark+ Wade = BMW
Not Mark wasting a card that could've brought back Bob by drawing them all while the ghost was still hunting
I would love to hire Wade to take me on virtual tours of these places lol. Not just phasmophobia, but all these haunted/horror games lol, and then bring along Bob and Mark just for their snarky remarks. Wade and Friends Ghost Tours!
Does anyone know what the music from the background at 10:57 is called??
Have you tried running or hiding from the ghost? That's technically what you are supposed to be doing instead of sitting there and yelling lol.
lixian turning the moon into a jumpscare genuinely scared me so bad </3
We want more!
ah, hell yeah! New phas vid.
Ghost watching them like, "The Three Stooges?"
These r the videos everyones been waiting for yes :)
So… when is Wade’s Onlyfans coming out?
“t r i e d  t o  t h r o w  t h e  c u p  a t  y o u  m a-“
You are on your own mark   dies a second after that
What is the song in the intro…
They met Lisa!
Mark could have revived bob if he waited for the hunt to end lolll
I play this so much with my friends I now associate the character faces to my friends this is disorienting lol
HE PLAYED PHSMOPHOBIA?!?!?!?!?!
i wasn't ready for the moon
Hey kool the Amityville Horror picture.
the minute of silence before he understands that the ghost is there
i wasnt paying attention and when they said wimdy it caught me off guard bc thats my username on some games and i was just 0-0
The fact that mark pulled a high preiestess during a hunt hurts me greatley
It is my birthday today  I'm 21
Thanks Lixian, Im afraid of the moon now
I missed phasmophobia
I love the references. One map has slenderman in the forest and the campsite has Jason’s mask in the water
17:10 The funniest part of the video 🤣😂🤣
It’d be cool if there was a possession ghost, and it recorded bits of your audio. So then it would possess you and control your character, and replay audio clips to confuse the others
I've been scared to play this by myself lately. I wish I can play with you.
so many updates is the reason of me quitting phasmo tbh, hunting mechanism keeps changing, the game lacks certainty
Fun facts: hantu (Malay) literally means ghost
i haven't played phas since the cursed objects update and breaking a few mirrors (while never being able to find the other items ;'D) . . ↓ list of ghosts from vidoe C: round one:     Goryo | the ghost was invisible so im assuming (correct me if im wrong :D) round two:     Hantu (confirmed by contract payment tab) round three:   Onryo (confirmed by contract payment tab)
The way that mark pulled up the death card and keep drawing the cards like hes doing a magic trick got me laughing
watching them play  and knowing how to play the game.. hurts XD its like theres so many clues or things to do or not to do
hantu is just literally malay for "ghost". 🤣🤣🤣
at the campsite theres multiple easter eggs, jasons mask floats from the lake, the blair witch totem, theres a body under the cabin in a body bag, theres a hint to it in the lobby, if you light the campfire theres a chance for slenderman to spawn in the surrounding forrest,oh and the snowman watch you.
The way BOB died
Hi
MARK literally got high priestess and hangman x_x
11:00 THE PAUSE OF THE MUSIC THEN HIM FACING TO THE BACK LOOKING LIKE HE'S HUGGING HIMSELF ToT
more pls
level 1 player: "AYE HAVE NO AYDEA WHAT AHM DOOEEEEEENG!" @.@ level 1000 player: _recites counterspells in ancient Sumerian, backwards_
did the game get harder or they became worst? xD
FUCK YEA IVE BEEN WANTING HIM TO PLAY THE NEW UPDATE FOR SO LONG
Ey the gang is back
john madden
Camping with Markiplier.
me and my friends call the closet ghohst billie eyelash
You guys,with Jack need to do this again!!!
JESUS CHRIST, can they dim that journal a bit?!? - I almost got blinded!
I laughed out loud at Wade's level... XD
1:06 P.T.-ass moment... Literally copied.
Plz do more phasmophobia with Bob and wade!
OMG I just scrolled back on my notification and you’ve revisited this game! YESSS
that was the sickest intro ive ever seen on marks channel
the fact that mark got hanged man during a hunt so it didnt count... wow
mark is so lucky that he got death and then the hermit right after
you should also try and get 666 on the loby basket ball game, also using the UV you can see secret writing
Epic intro mark couldn’t have done it better
Headphones+full volume+moon jumpscare=OW
I love how despite Wade being level 1500+ he seems to have forgotten ghosts can move on Professional and higher lol And of COURSE Mark continues to start talking as soon as he realizes a hunt is starting 😂
After watching this I can safely say I would LOVE to see a phasmophobia themed tarot deck matching that decks artwork IRL
10:48
u need to make another phasmo series
4:53
I would love a weekly phasmaphobia video with the boys
Omg can we pls have more phasmaphobia mark? With Bob and Wade of course, it always brightens my day and makes me laugh
5:16 my lucid nightmares whenever my brain goes “oh man, just imagine if their was a jumpscare in this.”
he gets a 2% card high empires and 1% hang man  but it was all on huts so It was the fol
Yes yes YES YES YESSSSS MORE VIDEOS ON THIS GAME FINALLY
I would really like them to play ghost hunters corp. See their reactions to all the craziness in that beauty.
did they stream this at twich?
Yaaay more mark, Bob and Wade 😄 there so funny together
Fun fact- the last picture Lixian zoomed in on in the beginning is a legitimate photo from the Amityville house. It's a picture of one of the younger sons that was massacred by their brother.
Nah this game is just fire
Memento Mori, Unus Annus
Funky
You should start playing more of this. I love it!
Was anyone else sitting there going, "MARK! Stop... drawing... CARDS already! WTF are you doing??"
Holy shit I'm so happy to see another phasmophobia video. You should collab with insym on a phasmo video.
Mark: *pulling a high priestess during a hunt, turning it into a fool Me: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Bob using the mirror and then the door instantly shuts and locks on him, and Wade and Mark hear him dying from outside had me ROLLING 🤣
Watching mark waste the entire deck of tarot cards, including the high priestess, during the hunt had me crying 😂😂
bob: "we are both good at this where have you been?" mark: in space  wade:         wug
5:18 :warning do not click:
you soooo cool
Got as far as Mark drawing the High Priestess that would've brought Bob back, but it was during the hunt so it became the fool. Absolutely lost it.
I missed these!
bobs last words:   OH MARK WAS TALKING COME ON!
I love how mark somehow survives last even though he's doing EVERYTHING that could kill him Example: screaming at the top of his lungs when the ghost hunts, and literally drawing like 20 cards
Mark with the tarot deck: "It's time to d-d-d-d-duel"   Watching Mark plays this stresses me out so much, I love it lol.  Wade giving up because he knew Mark was gonna do something stupid cracked me up. This Phasmo series is the absolute best.
Mark, you have to stop talking man xD you kill your mates by talking while a hunt!!!
POV: Mark ist so Unlucky drawing only Jokers tf 8:30 - 9:11
Mark: “throw the cup at me if I’m about to die” Bob: *nothing* Mark: “oh okay I’m good” *three seconds later* Bob: *throws cup at mark* Mark: “IM ABOUT TO DIE?!” 😂😂
Mark: "BOB NO!" Bob: *neck snaps*
“No me, *Dies*” -Wade
Holy shit Wade's level caught me off guard... Gawd dayum bruh!
When they tricked him into dancing his ass in front of the camera 😂😂
bob possessing the coffee cup is by far one of the most unexplainable yet the most hilarious thing to me
i ask more i got more
That ghost had some pretty bad allergies
Lol @ 11:02 🤣😂
"tried to throw the cup at you man-"
Mark can't see himself in photos. Vampiplier?
Bob Is The Living Definition Of “I Did Some Grinding Off Camera.” 🤣
Hmmmmm bob kinda sounds like phone guy 🤨🫢🤔@matpat
lixion has become doremon at this point
Me and the the bois M E R G I N G  S A C K S.
Mark go in the camp map and lite the fire and stare near the blare wich thing there's a Easter egg
the moon nearly killed me off
Yeeet
Jason's mask floats up and all he says is "that's weird"... you uncultured swine! x)
After devoting a lot of time into this game, this video was incredibly painful to watch, lmao Please Mark Stop FUCKING YELLING AT THE GHOST WHILE ITS HUNTING - Your items flipping out and the front door locking means you have to actually fucking hide and get away from it lol Also fun fact: The ghost isn't just angered by you saying its name: cussing or being loud also anger it just as much
Mark Ima be real with you         WE NEED MORE OF THIS, ITS TO GOOD TO NOT WATCH BTW I love you videos it's really entertaining
How did he not die
The design on the backs of the tarot cards actually fucks really hard and I kinda want it on a phone case or smth
24:36 what is he referencing i want to feel included
to bad he pulled the high priest during the hunt or bob coulda came back lol
They added Tarot cards? Neat
Want more videos of this with all you guys!!!!!
its wade throwing it back for me  😭🖐
Can someone help me out here what’s he referring to at 25:00?
Mark and Bob are perverts! 🤣💀 Also, "Is it a cursed object?" "No, it's just cursed to look at." is a perfect burn.
I wish this was on console
Omg, this  Was funny. Please do more of these these are hilarious!
Bob not knowing how terrifying he was on Mark's end at the beginning in the van killed me 😭 "I'm the guy in the brown jacket right" Mark, who had gotten a really good look at him as he stared in a moment of building suspense and horror:  i see that yeah 😂😭
I nearly died when Mark made Wade mimick sex positions 😭
What is 24:36 a reference to? Could somebody clue me in :)
Mark please make more phasmophobia content, I love every part of these videos.
Honestly I'm glad this series is back but I preferred it when the game was a lot more simple and NONE of them knew what they were doing... It made it much more funny when something happened but they could still get the mission done
<Mark looks at the pictures that only show Wade> "IT'S JUST HIM IN ALL OF THESE!" (Points if you get this reference)
Finally!
muffled* "I tried to throw the cup at you mark" lmao
Death, “uhh guys I got bad news” the fool, the fool, the fool, the fool, the fool, the fool, the fool, the fool
Camping with markiplier in the Future ?????
Lixian Jumpscare Compilation
i wish i could have seen the pictures 😢😅🤔😏
.
i'm so glad theyre back i've missed phasmophobia with the gang
i was warned about the moon jumpscare, so why did i jump so hard💀
You can hide in the tents at the camp site.
YOURE NOT EVEN SAFE OUTSIDE
Sometimes God does listen to your prayers, and that's why we have ourselves another phasmophobia video 🤸‍♀️ feeling faithful again
What is the tune from 24:55 from? I know it from somewhere but can't put my finger on it and it drives me nuts.
30:26 COPYRIGHT! THE DEVS OF THE GAME BETTER HAVE ASKED TO USE THAT!
More pls
We need more of this, please 😂
I love how wades just the disjointed parent of the group lol
would love to see more phasmophobia video's
Why do they pretend they don't know how to play or what's going on lol? They're both over level 20, they've played loads.
Anyone notice how on one AirPod/earbud you can only hear one person better than the other?? Like how if one person is to the left of mark you can hear them better on the left same for if they are on the right?? Little cool thing right there
I feel like I know the reference, what is it?
Talking on the radio is part of the game mark
*It's been so long :D*
Honestly, I know that every other person  has said this in a markiplier video, but now I actually understand it. I found this video because I needed to cheer myself up after crying. My parents just went through a divorce, I went through a breakup, and my gender identity stuff was stressing me out. All of the bad things in life were piling up and I thought I would be fine but once I was alone in my room I bursted into tears. I’ve always had trouble when it comes to emotions because I was bullied for being sensitive so my gut reaction was to watch something funny. I guess it did help this time, and to anyone else out there going through similar stuff, please understand that you aren’t alone. It took me a long time to open up to people, and even now I still struggle with it. Please to those also struggling, reach out to someone you trust, wether that be a sibling, a parent, chosen family, best friend, partner, anyone. Don’t beat yourself up for things that you can’t control. Markiplier videos are my comfort, I hope everyone else out there has found theirs as well. Stay safe out there. (Also if you found this and want to vent in the replies, go ahead, I will not judge anyone)
i like mark playing phasmo but i dont like playing it myself :/
wow your hair grows fast mark...I'm bck btw guys🤗👋
I got the In Space with Mark reference at 24:36. Anyone else?
How did mark just ignore the soccer ball rolling straight toward him lmao
What is Mark referencing at the campground?
In the beginning where they're just saying "Hello?" at each other, I kept expecting one of them to start the "Hewwo" meme which absolutely means I am internet-poisoned need to get off the computer and go touch grass
I'm suprised yet also not suprised they didn't mention the Hantu Tetek from their super neat podcast Distractible
Bob with the mirror was comedy gold
More pls
yeeessssssss it's back
30:25 nice Easter egg lol
14:35 hello there
Wish this was on consoles
More of this please
I appreciate the old model Majora's Mask moon being used as a Jumpscare.
Please keep playing this game we need more!!
So what I take from this is  never go ghost hunting with Mark.
I miss this series. I'm glad it's back.
Someone should have given him the UV light on the stand to the right of the whiteboard to look around!
They got a Hantu and didn't even reference Distractible
wade: i think it killed you mark. me: WELL NO SHIT SHERLOCK!
Fire intro ngl
"I CANT SPRrrrrrrIIIIIUUUUUNNNNNTTTTTTTTTTT" - man with no stamina
25:03 Don't worry. I got the reference! :D
Me being terrified but laughing at the interactions
is nobody going to talk about that blink 182's "WhErE aRe YeEeEeWwWw"? ok, fine
let’s goooooooo i love phasmophobia i have been waiting for another video
4:24 Rick Sanchez
I'm a big fan of the return of "you right"
Going from Mark's videos being my first exposure to Phasmo, finding Insym's videos, then coming back to Mark playing this is like supernatural whiplash, lmao.
at 3:24 your sanity went down and you hadnt even started yet XD
Just because of all the weird sh1t Mark made him do again and because in general, it's appropriate: Big kudos to Lixian, his work makes everything three times better than it would have been already
YES! I awaited the day they revisited Phasmo.
Call me ignorant, but is the "Howdy Camper" bit from Unnus Annus, Distractibles or something else?
11:00 LOL I laughed so hard at that
1:48 best scene
the door jumpscare in the lobby is actually the only thing that made my friends jump out of their chairs (we're played tons of games. but that jumpscare is just genuine)
“NO ME” you’re on your own now mark  What why!? *Snaps neck*
Watching you guys play this is never not entertaining
I love these types of videos, they always get me the most lmaooo
I love Phasmophobia but you haven't played it for a long time
These are the best of friends!
"Just do better... and that's basically it." - every great teacher ever (not) lmao
mark really got a high priestess and a hanged man in the same deck, but the ghost was hunting so they were fools LMAO
Okay but this comment is for the distractble listeners does anyone remember that "One guy" They talked about campfire guitar guy and how there was a ghost that was the campfire guitar guy and that it was playing a guitar in a phasmophobia map-
I hope you guys do more of this game
mark saying "joHn mADden" had me dying XD
if anyone wants to know what hantu is it means ghost in Malay
If I recall correctly, the mirror drains 7 sanity for every 1 second of use
If I recall correctly, the mirror drains 7 sanity for every 1 second of use
Bruh mark sounded like mommy long legs in chapter 2 when she was getting crushed😅🤣
when mark told his editor to make the moon a jumpscare, i through my phone out the window lol
phasmaphobia did a Friday the 13th reference at 30:24
1:30 bob: "I almost ran away" me: "it was somebody sneezing"
This game is still boring even after these updates
I cant tell you how much i love mark, wade, and the others.
I cant tell you how much i love mark, wade, and the others.
I'm obsessed with the phasmophobia videos and now there is a new one after a year! I'm hyped
YEEES I WAS WAITING FOR NEW EPISODE OF PHASMOPHOBIA  Edit: please make more
Everyone: the ghost will hear and kill you when hunting  Mark: AAAAAAAHHHHH I GOT BAD NEWS AAAAAAAH
Literally just started playing and you upload as if by magic
please notice this mark. please play ghost corp with the boys it the same as phasmo but much more exorcism stuff. who’s with me
9:07 Mark Got The Hanged Man on his first deck of cards?! Lucky... it has an 1% chance of happening. if been trying to get that for 70 maps in a row XD
Gg!
Please bring back Phasmophobia
I'm so glad you guys still play this!
YESS
What was mark referencing with that camp stuff?
Wade's timing on the "speaking of skeletons in the closet" and the skeleton falling out was *chef's kiss*
My sister tried to prank me with the closet prank but unfortunately for her, I watched a lot of Vanossgaming, Terroriser and Nogla's phasmophobia video. I was aware of that prank.
I really enjoy watching the Gang watch Phasmophobia, please do more of these :D
Omg phasmo you didn’t play it for so long tysm
Did anyone notice that one of the things you can name the ghost as like phantom it said jim my new scariest ghost is jim his veryrty scary he plays with my toes and looks at me and smiles he scawy mummy
I don’t know if this helps but you can put the camera on the tripod then pick up the tripods and it saves you a slot
Howdy camper. We’re making s’mores.
I highly suggest to play Paranormal PI. Its the most realistic ghost hunting game so far.
mf is like 600 times their level lol
The room jumpscare was a friggin sneeze
I finally got to play Phasmophobia IN VR. And it's horrifying.
I like how it was never explained he needed to turn off lights or hide during the hunt. They at least warned him about talking though not like he listened
Mark should do short horror stories featuring Bob and Wade, but in every story Bob and Wade die in horrible ways leaving Mark as the last survivor or the last one to die.
HOLY CRAPPPP ITS BEEN SO LONG! *insert fnaf music*
18:51 Mark said "It could be Hantu", 🤣  'Hantu' means Ghost in Indonesia/Malay language, so it suprising he said It suddenly.
These series will remain one of my most fav series from Bob Mark & Wade. Wade just trying to lead the other 2 who just walk around barely helping xD And also....why didn't I even get a notification of this video being released? There's literally nothing in my notifications about this vid
Wait??..Hantu??? Really??...its literally meant ghost in my language lmao
"Lixian, turn the moon into a jumpscare" Me: *tries to rush to get my mouse and pause* *-Gets scared anyway*
Maby someone should thell them during the hunt the ghost can sence active electrical devices and they should turn em off or leave them on the ground >w<.
24:30 I love that in space with markiplier reference😁  If you haven't watched it yet I would recommend doing so. I'm not going to lie I cried while watching it, it's just such an amazing experience to go through!😄
It was kinda funny, right when I clicked on the video, I was wondering," When was the last time we got an intro?" and then we got an "intro" 🤣🤣
This game is so fun to watch with you guys
FINALLY some more phasmo been waiting for so long
Ghost: kills both of Mark's friends infront of him Mark: "this Ghost is a little agressive" 🤣
Yay back on Phas! Damn that moon jumpscare I’m trying to fall asleep!
13:26 Those aren't nostrils, that's a duplex! ~ Crow T. Robot.
This game is on roblox!
I love how Wade says before starting the mission that when the ghost is hunting any noise will alert it and Mark starts yelling the moment he's put in that situation. 😂
I swear... Lixian is going to make me spill my drink one of these days..
I really hope Mark releases the other gameplay of this where he randomly screams JoHn MaDdEn in the echoey voice😂
Oh wait this video is new  Hmmmmmm
Wait level 1500 or whatever how much do you play yo your computer at that level has ghost in it lol
I LOVE when these guys play games together!   lol
Back to the gaming 😏 bought an xbox x series just so some ahole can drone off me so i have to reset everything
HE PULLED A HIGH PREISTESS DURING THE HUNT :O AND ALMOST GOT HANGED MAN
17:12
Bring the forest back!
0:24 Hey!!! It's Bob!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How does hunting work now?
Hantu?? Hantu in what? I mean, in Indonesi it just means ghost. You mean like pocong? Kuntilanak? Setan?
“It’s definitely gonna be a Raichu” Me waiting to jump them as they walk in the front door: “f*ck”
This reminds me of the original Wade and Bob Minecraft series! So nostalgic
I’m so happy mark is making more videos on this game
Phasmapornia
5:17 I knew the jumpscare was coming and yet it still scared the hell out of me lol
Hey MArk theres a slenderman easter egg on one of the maps! Good luck finding it :)
this is hilarious. I would LOVE to see more phasmo vids! <3
what was the reference to like 25 minutes in
Lol
next time can you please play it in vr
does the surround sound make anyone else uncomfy??
Funny joke Bob hahaha haha, anyways mark you should play this game called kid keys 2.0 it is some top tier stuff.
We need more phasmophobia with markeplier
6:49 holy shit when this part played, loud thunder went off outside
What are the odds that the light went out when MARK walked past it? Like isn't that the thing that happens to him irl?
I accidentally pressed the dislike button and it said feedback was sent to the creater- Sorry Mark- 😭 But don’t worry, I hit the like button again
Please! More phasmophobia
YESS FINALLY MORE PHAMSOPHOBIA
I love that Mark pulls the high priestess, and for those of you unaware, the high priestess card returns someone from the dead. And… If you pull a card while the ghost is hunting, it eliminates that card and instead gives you the fool.
WHAT THE FU#$ LEVEL 1,536
“Safeplace” = Trust “You’re on a safeplace” = Don’t Trust
Im gonna tell you now this is game is 20x scarier in vr
can you  play with dantdm?
"Lixian, turn the moon into a jumpscare!" But uh- isn't there already a jumpscare of the moon? The daycare attendant?
Them : Hantu. Me : Ghost. Them : The Hantu. Me : The Ghost. Them : Its a Hantu. Me : Its a Ghost.
What was the reference
Immediately reminded me of that glorious moment when mark was screaming while everyone else was locked out of the house and they could hear him dying
I’ve missed these videos!!!!
wasnt this already posted
32:13 killed me. I don't even know how Wade made that noise.
how is wade level 1500 wtf
Bruh the moon jump scare scared me so much
Get Sean in on the next one
THE MOON JUMPSASCRE SCARED ME I HATE THE ZELDA MOON
Please play with Insym!! He knows a lot about the game and could help you with th new stuff!
I could not lie about this, but halfway through watching this, I got a message saying my 4th grade teacher died.
I didn't expect him to actually turn the moon into a jumpscare. Damn these inconsistant jump scare queues, lol
I’ve been waiting for this for almost 2 years
Me: Oh hey, a new Markiplier Phasmophobia vid, haven't seen these in a while, this should be a fun jape.   Husband: (walks into dimly lit bedroom silently and hovers around door just on edge of periphery)....hey Me: OH SHIIIIIII (throws laptop at him)
Im so glag this series is back! i loved rewatching the old ones lmao
Thank you for finally revisiting phasmo, been waiting for a long time for this.
22:56 Bob just going "uh huh, uh huh, that's cool" before the mirror shows something red and the door instantly closes is comedy gold
What ghost was it 😭
Now I can't help but imagine a Markiplier Insym crossover...
Anyone else think the stick figure looked like it came straight outta the Blair witch.....
Sus..
24:37 - The Most obvious Reference to ISWM  Bob: _Wut?_ Mark: *_-Inner Pain-_**_ Bob do you not know what I'm talking about?_* Bob: *_Was That a Reference to something?_* Mark: *_-SCREAMS-_*
I wish they would’ve played during the Halloween update. I didn’t have the UV light on, so it was extra dark. And when I first opened the locker, I saw something come at me and it scared me so bad. I then realized it was just the skeleton falling out of the closet 😭😂
bob is as funny as his name is unique
John Madded...   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
every phasmophobia video needs to be in vr so mark can be more scared
$180 for Bob's life. Sounds like a good deal.
WE NEED MORE PHASMOPHOBIAAAAAAAAAAAAA
still can't believe how different Mark looks after all these years xxx
the skeleton in the closet is uncle gerald the ghost in the door is Haley and the eyes are father tom(hes a priest)
I loved the effects at the beginning. Super spooky. Good Job Lixian!
*sees youkai as a type of ghost* well that's fuckin vague. There's so many different kinds of youkai! They're not even ghosts, but that's not the point here. If they're just throwing any ol' broad category of supernatural creature why isn't fey on there?
As someone who knows a bit about tarot, the wheel of fortune isn’t always bad and the death card can be really good depending on other cards drawn with it
24:49 CuT tHe YeLlOw WiRe
blacklight the starting room or as Wade puts it "a safe place" & you'll find something trippy ;) xxx
KEEP THIS SERIES GOING
I do not appreciate the moon Lixian
I haven't watched much markiplier for about 2 weeks, it good to come back to seen the best trio there is
Plz play more sea of thieves aaaaaa
more phasmo please! Its SO funny!
5:42 Is no one going to comment on the amazing Blink-182 reference?
This reminds me of the episode that Mark kept dying to a ghost. It was the episode mark learned how to juggle Calk XD
I MISSED THIS SERIES SO MUCH!!!!
😈💀
since I paly the game and I understand a lot when they where playing the first game he dogged death Like 20 times. XD
YES! I’ve been waiting for another phasmophobia video. Hope you had a good break :D
Mark: "John Madden. John Madden. John Madden. John Madden." Me: "aeiou aeiou aeiou aeiou aeiou aeiou"
7:10  i thought mark was gonna move the camera into the bath XD
1:35
This is probably among my favorite 3 lets plays. Always excited for more phasmo!
Cards will always be the fool during a hunt
year 2014: Hello everybody welcome to the game! we're playing with name and name.  year 2022: Do we do intros anymore? not really.
I’ve missed these videos
Wade needs a new headshot photo.
The fact that Wade is level 1536 😂
moon got me, spooky stuff
The King of YouTube himself has a new intro for Phasmophobia. Really was hoping Wade would say Kaiju instead of Raiju
I've watched this video twice and both times the moon jumpscare got me 😆 I know it's coming but it still manages to startle me
sadly, I've watched it at "the boys" channels and less edited...
This game aint there for long anymore wait till more people discover ghost exile 100x better
the fact mark was screaming with flashlight on pains me  also anyone see that the hanged man was the fool? he got super lucky there
"THE MOON" jumpscare actually got me and made me spill some rice XD Good edit, Lixian!
Literally died a little with that Moon jumpscare, if you're reading this, Good Lob Lixian!
The fact that he could have possibly revived bob if he didn’t waste the cards during the hunt is pretty funny
At long last
Bro that “hey” scared me😭😂
HOW THE HELL is Wade on LVL 1536?!
If you slow the video down to when mark gets scared in the lobby you can see the exact moment his soul tried to leave his body
The coffee cup being thrown at mark’s face to confirm he is about to die during the hunt was amazing 😂  Edit: Omgsh lol wade walking in front of him to save him then instantly dying 😂
Hantu is just hantu tho?? In Malay😅 ghost
32:00 my favorite moment out of this whole video 😂😂
Argh! Why does YouTube give me alerts for everything *but* the stuff I find genuinely entertaining! But I love the video Mark, Bob and Wade!
5:19 it actually got me xD
11:02 wade literally just took the hit for mark lmao
As funny as it is to hear Mark freak out during hunts, he needs to zip it during them. The new update means ghosts will lock onto you and kill you if keep talking during hunts.
I scared the shit out of myself with that door by accident, but i never thought to look up! 😧
Drew markiplier this morning! Now I watch this and want to draw him screaming 😂
18:49  Hantu is a ghost
NEW PHASMOPHOBIA EPISODE LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Mark : *"BOB NUOU!"* **krek* Wade : "what card did he draw?" Mark : "death(?)" **picks up card* **draws death* Mark : _"igotbadnewsigotbadnewsigotbadnews uh I GOT BAD NEWS"_
I just had the ghost closet initiation myself last night xD
Why did the Majora's Mask moon jumpscare get me?!?! I knew it was coming!
You could read the name before that update?
11:06 was scary lol😂 it was on point
yeah there's always a night vision camcorder in every horror game
The hantu? Like, the hantu titek? The boob ghost from distractable?
More phasmaphobia content!!!
Mark’s first card: “Death.” The rest of the cards he panic drew: “A tarot; but actually jk, The Fool.”
9:00  game is straight up calling mark out hard for being an idiot lmao, all his cards are fool without fail after drawing death the first time
Mark not putting the camera on the tripod before he leaves the van makes me wanna scream 😂😂
Finally another Phasmophobia Episode! Awesome to see the content again! 👍
Day 8 of asking you to play red dead redemption 2 John's part
32:04 I would shit my pants
Wade: "No! ME! That's right, your on your own now Mark!" *Gets strangled by the ghost*
hello ^^
the jumpscare moon scare the living out of me
Is spirit boxing related to shadow boxing? 🤔
Glad they lighten the mood by looking in each others mouths
I’m glad you revisited this because I only just discovered the fist videos before this released. I hope there’s more
Yesss, more plasmo videos! Love seeing all you guys together
I never play this but Hantu is how we say Ghost in Indonesia not a kind/type (?)
this video is so funny i can"t stop laugh😀😃😄😁🤣
At 8:54 he got one of the rarest cards in the game and it was a fool bc the ghost was hunting lul
Mark: "Hey Gu-"  "I tried to throw the coffee cup at you, ma-"
Mark's reactions are amazing lol
Yay! I missed you guys together in a gameplay. ♥
BRUH Wade called the skeleton in the locker Steve as well lmao  I called him Steve ever since he showed up
More!! phasmaphobia
Mark, you can put the camera on the tripod and then pick up the tripod.
mark please play this in vr its way scarier...
He's back!
The game really did have a big update, and Markiplier playing this with the boys  is always  funny one way or another  and especially editing of Lixian was legendary.... 😂🇮🇳😎👏👌👍❤️🌹
4:00 for a second I thought that was Owen Wilson himself playing Phasmophobia with Mark  Wow.
Also if you use the fingerprints flashlight thingy then you can see drawings inside the lobby creepy drawings and satanic stuff its pretty cool theyre all over the walls and floor
Mark, can we play Phasmophobia together with my other friends who are fans of you.
Ghost Bob got me cackling
8:53 you just WASTED the high priest, it's a 2% chance you get that, it gives you an extra life (u cant pull cards during a hunt, it will all automatically turn into the fool card (meaning what  you just pulled doesnt count anymore)) but i don't think ur all planning to play this so seriously lol. OMG and 9:09 is instant DEATH, that's a 1% chance to get that
YES thank you for bringing the series back
I love mark playing Phasmophobia, would love to see more!
Mark actually avoided reviving Bob AND getting instantly killed by drawing cards during a hunt.
So many updates but still the same old characters to choose from
"Yesterday is make history" "Tomorrow is mystery" "Today is gift" "That is why it called present"
For the mirror and the ouija board if you run out of sanity and attempt to use them they break and start the hunt.
Cool intro man.
Bucket list: Play Phasmophobia with Mark, Bob, and Wade. Phasmophobia is such a fun game and these 3 are so great 🤣😂.. What I would give to have a moment like this ^!!!! I'm not saying that it would have to be like.. a video for the bucket list check off... I just.. a simple round of Phasmophobia. Just 1. Although I'm not against more... But just.. I want the happiness knowing that I got to play with my favourite 3 GoofBalls 🤣😂
I love when you guys play this game!
Mark, I love you man, thank you so much for your content ♥
You can tell this game isnt scary anymore.
It’s a miracle that Mark survived that long in the first game.
Whoooooooo
30:26 Nice touch...
mArk i tHinK iT KiLlEd yOu
The pure joy I get from a reference to the heckin wimdy meme. That's my favorite
Ugh throwback to when I was able to stretch my lumbar, fuck XtremeCraze 😂
mark should do a camp grounds youtube special like he did with a heist with markiplier. and it would be cool if it was like a pick your way thing while trying to survive a Jason type murderer
YAY FINALLY! I've been waiting for markiplier to pick up this series again!
1:52 was an actual picture taken from an investigation that boy in the pic was something Demonic
Bro had a high priestess (which he wasted) and a hanged man in the tarot cards 😭 And he survived the hanged man ;-;
All jokes aside, cool intro
Moon jumpscare made me drop my phone on my face🤦‍♂️
I thought they would never return to this game
Hey lixian, you should give free editing classes for people who want to create stuff like you and mark. It is so cool what you two do together, well, maybe more you Lixian.
Mark I've missed you guys playing Phasmophobia, it's just so hilarious and entertaining to watch you all get the shit scared out of you!
So glad Mark is back to Phasmaphobia. I hope we get to see more! :D
bro I was waiting forever for marks pov to come out
the way he kept using the cards lmao
Mark was so lucky that the ghost was a Yokai on Widow.   For those that don't know, if you talk when the ghost is close or your light is blinking, the ghost pings your location and goes there.  Yokai's have a reduced detection range and hearing during hunts. (It has like 2m range) If it was any other ghost, Mark was dead.   (It could've been a banshee as well)
So glad to finally see them back playing this game
please make more, your content is so good with this game
Normal Mark behavior: Yelling  Mark about to be killed by a ghost: Yelling louder
Finally!
I miss these
Can we have more phasmaphobia
The whole deck consisted of fools holy shit XD
Wade’s timing in this episode is so good
Mom
Football!
The in space reference just made me think of the "AAAAAAAAA" scene because mark mentioned it in the live stream after
MORE!!
Waiting for them to try Ghost Hunters Inc.
Bob coming into the chat in reverb made me laugh out loud
Mark your just invisible
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG, PLEASE DO MORE PHAS VIDS
Watching this at night during a thunderstorm
Draws a card: Death Death does not come to Markiplier.
How did I MISS THIS TILL NOW T^T Thanks for bringing this back I love this game
how come mark does stupid stuff every time yet is one of the last to die
Wade: *Opens up closet for a skeleton to fall out* Wade: That's- uh, Steve.
LEVEL 1536?!?!??! HOW MANY HOURS DID THAT TAKE?!
mark fooling the only card that could bring his friend back to life xD poor mark he had no clue that its all gonna be fool cards while he ghost is moving around
I appreciate Mark for referencing "John Madden" but he could've also thrown out the classic "aieou" as well to really confuse the guys 😂
Wind's howling.
HOLY FUCKIGN SHIT THE MOON JMPSCARE I PEED M Y PANTS
these videos make me laugh so much please do more phasmoohombia
More phasmaphoba
I love how hes walking around with the camera on all thr time telling the ghost "I am here! Come get me!" The whole time
play it
is that a jojo reference
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN!!!!!!
i need more of this
HOW DID I MISS THIS WHEN I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
I'm sad that Mark pulled up both a High Priestess and THEN a Hanged Man on the same deck, that would've been AMAZING to see. But alas, him panicking and wasting his cards was also funny.
PLEASE PLAY MORE PHASMOPHOBIA I LOVE THESE
Holy shit they made a jojo reference in phasmophobia
Mark: *draws one card* I got bad news!   *continue to draw more*
I really hope you guys do more Phasmophobia, ypu three are the perfect combination of comady and funny reactions to horror that the Internet needs😂  Also an importent tip, you should activate the lights and generator, not only it slows the sanity reducation...  But it also can help you find the ghost type in specific situations  Also, yoi should look at the activity more often.... Ghosts like the Twins and the Oni would show very distctive Ghost activities
If you stop doing intro's I will cry and puke. I need about 45 minutes more of that in my life.
I feel bad that Bob and Wade didn't get the John Madden reference
would love to see this crew play with insym, wade and insym would be fine but mark and bob...
Never been more scared of a moon
DON’T OPEN THE DOOR MARK
The Campsite map has Blair Witch and Friday the 13th references!
Is nobody gonna talk abt how Wade is a level 1,536?!?!!??!!?!?!?
Wade as in wade willson
DO MORE PLEASE
9:09 you literally have a 1% chance to get this card, HOW
it would be quite cool if you could hear dead teammates through the spiritbox
i miss these videos and the bigfoot videos i love when mark bob and wade work together
Even if they were fool cards, this man drew both a high priestess and hanged man. I am smfh.
man the moon jumpscare actually got me bad
i am so dead inside that the majoras moon jumpscare only gave me a minor arrhythmia like the feeling you get when your parent tell you your in trouble XD
2:40 looks like a young mark
"DiD yOu gUyS sEe tHe gHoSt???"
lixian cmon the jumpscares arent good for my heart geez xD
im so glad they are playing this game again
11:53 Enardo Zerg video flashbacks 👀
I love his phasmophobia videos
phasmophobia literally grown better than 5 months ago its so good now but I dont understand some things
moree of thissss
pleas do more phasmophobia!
Yaaaay more Phasmo with the Boys 😁 you guys make me smile everytime ❤️
wade is 61.44 times marks level🤣🤣
I miss when mark actually knew the game or actually tried to be good at it. now he dont really try it just nothing but jokes.. just an op miss the old mark
What if they picked up Barotrauma again
Markiplier: Lixian, turn the moon into a jump-scare! Me, thinking: is it about to be the moon from Majoras Mask? Gets jump-scared by the Moon from Majoras Mask Me: Yep....
The cards are a jojo reference
I don't know why being able to move items while dead is so funny to me lmao
5:18 i hate you lixian
Wade is level *1536*
Good game thanks for the video
This is *exactly* like watching Ghost Adventures...
New IPad, new case, new stickers, fat cat, new pens, new antique books and finally, new phasmaphobia updates with Markiplier
this is literally so stressful to watch 💀💀
I need more Phasmophobia with these guys this is awesome 😂😂
14:00
I want that tarot card deck it looks so cool
I played campsite once and was dying to see them play that map. :)
is markiplier actually dr.clef as in a scp reference?
am late aint i
15:38. Speedrunners when their minecraft speedrun was off by 0.0000001 mm.
I’m bout to be doing this shit in real life I’m going to die 😂
Please do more! This was hilarious!!!
Having watched Phasmophobia videos for months on end makes this one of the funniest things to witness.
Wade saying that that was one of the worst hunts he'd ever been a part of is absolutely hilarious to me, considering he barely offered any assistance during that first round, on top of him not knowing where *Tanglewood's* cursed objects are, or saying that tarot cards spawn inside of drawers?? At level 1.5k+?? 😭😭Sir... Bro...
It shows that Wade really, really loves this game. His level is astounding.

BEANS
When Mark got the high priestess but it was the fool 😭💀
7 days to die and valheim!
that moon junpscare at beggining scared my soul out of the body
Hantu in Phasmophobia: *exists* Indonesians:
the ghost coming towards Mark and Wade looked so much scarier from Wade's pov lol
Low-key I thought mark was holding a propane tank
i love how they practically made wade a camgirl ithad my wheezing so damn hard
Mark: You guys wanna go get the cursed item? Bob: Sure! Famous Last Words
Everyone is talking about the tarot cards but can we talk about how mark got the high priestess and hanged man in the same deck? I don’t know if he’s lucky or Unlucky at this point 😂
That was a good Friday 13th reference
Ghost hunting with Markipleir
Mark draws the "The High Priestess" card during a hunt that hurts a lot watching that...😭 Because they all turn into "The Fool" cards during a hunt.
Mark,I have a request,please play arms reforger.
1:48 Mark explaining how he wants in space scenes to be
Mark - so could we turn down the difficulty a smidge ?  A lil skosh ? Wade - No. Mark- (wow)  ok then ?!
PLAY MORE
Wade: Take a picture of the bone Mark: I got a camera! *proceeds to stare at the bone silently with a video camera, then leaves*
Wade being the mvp 11:00 Bob being a sassy ghost 10:50 😭
8:44 - Is this game trying to tell us something about Mark?
The “Hey” at the beginning had me nearly jump out of my skin, I’m wearing my AirPods and have spatial audio turned on, I actually jumped XD
I Love how the first ghost they Encounter is Doris Johnson
Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. Read the Bible.
9:08 So lucky it was still hunting lol
Right at the start when he went to the door my soup almost fell out of my spoon on how suddenly I swung it and I can’t stop laughing about it now
1:00 Funni Jump Care
That was a nice reference to Friday the 13th
the lvl 1500 is def not legit lol :D
You need to look for the haunted potato!
25:07  I dont get it
Love to see Mark tackle Ace Attorney sometime lol.
Oh my god, we NEED more Phasmophobia from these three!
23:52 xp 69
please play moreeeeeeeeeeeeee
OMG! I don't know what it is but these are my favourite streams to watch. I think I've watched Mark's original phas playthru's on twitch 1000s of times. What a nice surprise to see a youtube video of the updates :D
MORE PLEASE MORE!!!!!  Laughing My ASS OFFF!!!
finally bro!
*what*
How dare you use the peasant flashlight!
yk if he would have waited and pulled out high priestess after the hunt, Bob would be alive ;-;
ffs the moon scared the crap out of me! xD I screamed :(((
Jack needs to come back and join the boys
dude like hahahahahahahahaahahahahah
Man I missed the phasmo content
I think the first ghost was a Yokai because of how dumb it was acting
Wade's death yell lol
Wait did you read my comment abt the updates?--
That twerking moment was beautiful
Mark:*about to die* Wade: no me!
Don’t talk while they hunt mark starts yelling as hard as possible
Play more plz mark I love watching this series
I'm a serious phas player and seeing the way mark fucks around with everything despite what he's being told to do and SURVIVING makes me violently angry
I was hoping they would see the Slenderman cameo at the campsite
I KANT SPREEEEENT!!!
Man, 3 of your videos are trending today! :D
ghost in indonesia is called hantu
love that he still plays with bob and wade after 10 years
Let’s gooooo! ITS BACK!
Phasmophobia is my favorite game they played together I hope they do more
Mark quoting about "Camping with Markiplier" is so nice to heaarrrrr<3
8:53 mark did pull a high priestess and the hanged man on a same deck, that is one of the rarest tarot cards deck if I've ever seen one, but the high priestess got fooled because of hunting, and he even got fooled on the hanged man after the hunt which is even luckier for him  Edit: nvm he pulled a hanged man while hunting
32:05 I have never heard Wade scream like that before, that was so funny 🤣
Do more of these
30:21 That floating hockey mask was wonderfully-timed, because I'd just been thinking that this map scenario seemed inspired by the typical Camp Crystal Lake experience.
That is the best into I've ever witnessed
I’m so glad the phasmophobia series is back! This series is hilarious,terrifying and has these three dorks making it even more Better!
They need to get Jack and complete the boys again then hunt some ghosts..   Also what the hell is that level Wade?
Mark play this in vr
Finally phasmophobia
*...What footage?*
i like your glasses mark and i just found out i need glasses and yeah but it's bad cause my glasses are dead or are on there way and just hahahha watching this i've been waiting for a new phasmophobia vid on this yay funny stuff
ghost exlies is a game you want to play so much better than phas!!
Man got high preiest and hang man but it was during a hunt lol
I was waiting for another phasmo video
Love these videos
Aeiou! John madden! Erbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr
25:03 “AAAAAAAAAAAH ITS TIME FOR THE SCOUTS OATH”
Mark: *Dies* Wade; "Mark, I think he killed you."
go make some blessed grapes. make sure to get the dark ones, they help a lot they heal all kinds of aliments esp if on lockdown. need priest from catholic church
Level 1,536 is psychotic
Bob?......
I always enjoyed the Phasmophobia series especially their older videos. I’m so glad they brought it back. Mark, Bob, and Wade always crack me up when they play this. These guys gotta play more of these games together
Love the editing it’s soo funny. Especially when the music comes on after wade sacrifices himself!!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!
The parts with Bob throwing the cup almost made me turn into a ghost.
I missed this so much, This episode had me crying
i've been waiting for this series to return for months
Hantu is actually a Malaysian word for ghost
I won’t lie that moon did jump scare me
i’ve been waiting for this one 😈 turn it up 🤭
God I hope they play more 😂❤️
OH MY GOSH BY FAR MY FAVORITE MARKIPLIER SERIES. ITS BEEN SO LONG. IM AM SO GLAD ITS BACK. May Ethan and Sean rest in peace 😟
Yes finally, I’ve wanted this for so long
MORE PHASMOPHOBIA
5:18 when you mention when the jumpscare will be, its less scary, would of been better if you said nothing and all of a sudden BAAAAAAAHHH
Hey an in space with mark reference! It’s at  24:31
Hey this is off topic but did mark say in one of the distractible podcasts he did a year of school in Maine or just like the main public system?
Who else got jump scared from the dumb moon jumpscare? I has the phone 3cm away from my face.
I have been waiting for this to come back for SO LONG! Thank you Mark!
That WAS the death cup. :3
Good ol' Wade & Bob!! 🤣🤣🤣😅
Boys...we NEED more Phasmaphobia! So bloody funny!!
MISSED THIS SERIES SO MUCH
25:03 What was he making a reference to... Was it [channel deleted], or something else?
I've been waiting for another Phas video for so long!! ;; we love to see it
5:15 why did that scare me, he even said it.
"I think I'm fine... It's not hunting. Definitely" Mark the definitely got me.
Could we get more of this videos there the besttt
Damn u really entered big brain club
them: finds a mask me: yo Friday the thirteenth
Makin a petition! Like if you wanna see these three and Sean/Jacksepticeye play phasmaphobia more and explore all the new stuff!!
ofc i had to watch this at night and get scared cuz of the fucking moon😂
anyone else think of the hantu tetek from Distracible during this video?
So glad you guys are back playing Phasmophobia. You should consider getting in touch with Insym. Dudes a master of the game and he’s already played with the Grumps, seeing all four of you together would make me lose my mind.
Wade and his ass had me dying
I guarantee you all, that they came straight from a distractable episode to record this.
Moremore more!
This is why I love phasmophobia
I scared and excited at the same time
Mark: *Plays with the curse item after it kills Bob* *Surprised Pikachu face*
I started smiling like an idiot when I saw Mark, Bob, and Wade posted new Phasmophobia content
In case anyone was wondering, the wheel of fortune card in the tarot deck is supposed to be good luck/what goes around comes around 😆
9:21 it looks like Bob is licking the plants 😂
What was it is a reference to?
FINALLY!
please do some more phasmophobia
D A  F U N N I 8:24 - Bob draws a tarot card and drops sanity to squat. Get hunted and dies 9:12 - Mark wastes all the tarot cards including a High Prestist mid-hunt 11:13 - Wade commits bye bye 12:12 - Follow the ghost leader 15:24 - Mark uses his head! 17:53 - Wade's Onlyfans 19:57 - Massages with Markiplier 24:32 - The wisdom of Bob :) 24:54 - WHAT 31:47 Bob gets twinned on
A blessing from the lord!
PHASMO YEEAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Im so glad youre back mark i missed you so much but i hope you had a great break and got some well deserved rest ❤️❤️❤️
Yes! I miss these c:
YESSS PHASMO UPLOAD POG.
“Oh uhhhh, NO” 😂😂😭😭
i LOVE phasmophobia videos with the boys B)
Wade getting his neck snapped after jokingly standing in front of Mark saying “NO ME” i cried laughing for ten minutes straight 😭😭😭
“howdy camper! you made it just in time :D”
I can't believe Bob and Wade finally beat Mark to the upload, usually they don't upload until days after, sometimes wade waits months.
Actually, exploding lights can indicate a Mare. They prefer exploding lights event because they're more likely to hunt in the dark.
24:36, I love the ISWM reference, Mark!
you can actually combine the camera and tripod before carrying them inside to free up an inventory slot :) just make sure not to scroll to any of your other items or you'll drop the combined camera+tripod on the floor. also, tarot cards won't work while a hunt is ongoing
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER FOR ANOTHER PHASMO VIDEO YESSSSSSSSSSSS
The end with the voice changer.. I just couldn't- I laughed so HARD!!!
The mirror breaks when on 0 sanity and is still being used.
OMG FINALLY A PHAS UPLOAD
If I am perfectly honest I feel that both Mark and Lixian are the luckiest guys alive knowing each other as they seem to get along so damn well even through the editing Lixian does, the simple little animated Lixians we have or the silly jumpscares we get like when Lixian scared us with a skunk, you couldnt have one without the other really as both Mark and Lixian have so much character and bring out the best in eachothers creative genius, this has been shown through so much and I hope Lixian continues to be the amazing editor we all know and love for as long as it makes him happy :D
Wade: “it can hear you when it hunts so you have to be carefull” Ghost: hunts Mark: i’ve got bad news, i’ve got bad news, AAAAAAH, i’ve got realy bad news, AAAAAAH, AAAAAAH!
Me : turns volume up to hear wind Mark : turn the moon into a jumpscare!
THEY FINALLY DID ANOTHER VIDEO LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
hi
I hope they realize there's a hiding mechanic too right?
WAIT EVERYONE HOLD THE PHONE Wade is level 1,536!!!
Again with the artificial "scary" music when ghost attacking...I'm sorry, it really is an unwatchable video for me. The game is supposed to be silent. Immersive. Now? It's just plastic.
Hype
Wade sacrificing himself was the funniest thing just because of what he said- 😂
TIP: Use the camcorder without a light at first to set up and scan the house. Creepy AF but gets the job done a bit faster.
JOHN MADDEN
I didn't think he would put a jump scare on the moon but now I've shit my pants so🧍🏻‍♂️
KEEP THE SERIES ALIVEE😩
YES YES YES YES
"They're so rich they have tent for their stuff!" - says man with FIVE ovens
ANOTHERRRRRRRRRR
I loved the Friday the 13 reference with the mask in the water.
dude this is the best intro ever!
I was cry laughing at Bobs character just dead face first into the plant😭
It never ceases to amaze me how bad they are at this game 🤣
I been waiting for one of these
finally it's come back in relevance , i missed this game and especially with mark and the boys
*stands abruptly, holds up three fingers* 24:43
I missed these
32:12 LMAO
Play wirh Insym! He said he'd love to! <3 All 4 of you together
Wade reminds me of the guy who has to show you your new job but obviously doesn't want too
Ironic how mark was the one to speak yet he didnt die first.
ooo tarot cards
I really love you guys playing this and I was just about to get to your last video on the playlist when you made this, thank you :)
The Update we all needed with best Trio ever!!! 😊👏👏👏👏👏💖
27:07  no one's going to mention campfire guitar guy? the map is literally campsite
we need more phasmaphobia. its by far my favourite game to watch from you.
The way wade sacrifice himself is too much good can't stop laughing after that 🤣
I can't believe he drew a High Priestess during a hunt. What a waste!
Aw, No Jacksepticeye this time?  I wish this game was on ps4 and switch.
I was playing on this map the other day with 2 of my friends and they were in the truck and I was running towards it in the damned front yard and got killed. I was both shocked and angry. 3:19
Leveling up in phas is very easy. Don’t get surprised.
1:43 hi steve :)
Mark: records guitar Me: Camp fire guitar guy!
YES!
17:49 not gonna lie the way he moved actually scared me at first 😂😂😂
"You're on your own now, Mark." **dies** That was incredible that the ghost actually went for Wade instead.
payday 2 when
I can not wait for the next episode
"N o , m e ."
please play more phasmophobia!! i love these videos
I have many concerns regarding Mark's amateur movie business
More pleaseee ❗️
"MaRK I ThInk it KiLLeD YoU"

“Coffee cup” part!!!😹🙀👍
MORE PHASMO
100% this is one of my favorite series im so so happy they brought it back!!!!!
I hope you guys do more of this I love this game esp when  you guys play with the editing :D
Hantu 👻
I miss Phasmophobia so much i'm happy they played it again
Mark didn’t put the part, “looking into the room at very beginning and he doesn’t want to do that (only on Bob and Wade’s videos).
Awesome!!! I needed this one from Markiplier’s perspective of hunting the ghosts; too hilarious!!!🧔🏻😹🙀😼👍👻
Scary game funny Mark, Bob & Wade I liked this video yes!!!!🤮😱👍😅
“…. I GOT BAD NEWS. IVE GOT BAD N E W S”
I got that reference!
So glad you’re doing more Phasmo, they’re Doing more updates and another map. Love watching you guys play this.
This is crazy I just got the game a couple days ago and started watching this series and now there is a new video it’s awesome!
WHAT
bro the moon jumpscared the shit out of me
OH MY GOD YES
Mark and Wade communicating to a dead Bob via a silent moving coffee cup is so much funnier to me than it should be
Okay that freaking ghost sound at 1:08 ish... I'm watching on my phone with headphones... and let's just say I've decided I'm not gonna keep watching this until I can watch without headphones because even a 2nd time it made me jump 😅😭😭
I just love watching you guys play games together. They are my favorite. Brings me back to Drunk Minecraft days <3 Love ya'll.
The ghost probably laughed so hard he decided to break wades neck first so he could hear more of it before eventually snapping marks
I LOVE THIS, you guys are the reason I got into phasmo and I’m so happy y’all got to play with the updates, it’s INSANE. they’ve updated it so much from when I even started playing it last year.
I like how noob mark is. He was a complete chad at some point
WE NEED MORE OF PHASMOPHOBIA ITS NEVER ENOUGH I LOVE IT SMM
Have u guys noticed that every in space with markiplier have reference to the videos he made?
TARROT CARDS?! IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
24:55  WHAT
25:45 omg mark u a legend, i cought u with the john madden
Wade: “it can hear you when it hunts so you have to be carefull” Ghost: **starts to hunt** Mark: i’ve got bad news, AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH, i’ve got really bad news, AAAAAAH, AAAAAAH!
11:12 The way Wade died lol
The moon jumpscare scared the living shit out of me!
They’re back!
The outro is fire
I don't have a pc but If I had I would played this game so much.
“It’s every low-self esteem persons dream photo” *FACTS-*
the way wade just turned to look at mark and say "MARK YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN" in the most terrifying voice right before he dies
Bob with the coffee cup is the best😂
8:26 Hahahah bad news.
If you love Phasmaphobia, try FOREWARNED. Similar to Phasmaphobia with a ghost-hunting and evidence system, but instead raiding an Egyptian tomb cursed by an immortal monstrous warrior. Would definitely make you sh** your pants.
I wonder if he'll check out forewarned. has lots of potential and can be pretty fun with friends. Pretty similar to phasmo
I love that Mark literally quoted his line from the camping segment of In Space before Bob proceeded to stop existing
I want more phasmophobia from you guys 😂
finally a new episode!!!!!!!!! more pls
This is exactly what I wanted except wanted jack too in it to mess around with new stuff and die trying figure it out
Wish jacksepticeye was with them too
Commenting so they bring back the series
Why would you edit so many annoying sounds during the hunt? Just keep it natural
Yes bring back more phasmaphobia!
No one: Me: 13:25 M-Mark Zuckerberg?
Wade: "If you speak at all while it's hunting it will find you." Mark: **yelling and screaming every time the ghost hunts**
I’m SO GLAD THIS SERIES IS BACK
Love this series
When the Tarot Cards are drawn during a hunt, they will all end up as "The Fool." Only draw them if the ghost isn't hunting.
26:57 probably this guitar is from China 😂
IT'S FINALLY BACK!!! We play it almost every day with my friends, and I was really hoping for some of the YouTubers I watch will play it again, so I can watch it. xD It had so many updates since the last video, I can't believe most of the people ditched it. It really got better with every patch.
The moon jumpscare got me
This game is always so fun! I play it everyday. Keep up the amazing work, your awesome.
It’s always so fun watching y’all play this. It’s a trip and this group just make it great
It was so painful watching mark waste all of the cards
1:33 my wifi agreed
First ghost was a Banshee  :)
mark u should watch insym
That was a pretty long segment of Mark and Bob making Wade a cam girl
MORE Phasmo, Mark! You three need to do moooore Phasmo! And Forwarned!
The series continues!
i love watching you guys play this
32:07 Wait. They didnt add bob saying the ghost is coming!? Cmon...
"You are on your own now Mark" *Breaks his neck*
Play more Phasmaphobia!!!!!
Will there be more? cause I miss this series. I love hearing everyone screaming for their lives
11:09 The moment Wade died I'm betting Bob was laughing his ass off
In indonesia, Hantu literally just means ghosts, in general
I was waiting for you guys to play phasmo! The game is so fun.
This video has basically introduced me to this game. One day in and now I'm crazy for it. Hope to get it someday
MORE PHASMOPHUCKERY PLEAS!!!! I Love it when they play phasmophobia...
My God, Mark and Bob watching Wade through the TV, hilarious xD
Quick lesson for you Americans. Qnything that's 0 or below is called freezing. Anything at 100 or above is boiling. Sorta based of those. (In celcius) for water of course.
Damn I miss these guys playing games together. Especially this omg..
them mispronouncing hantu (han like the name han and tu as too) to hey-ntoo makes me snort
Wade is always so competent in this game and he always suffers for it
I miss Mark throwing a can yelling 'CAULK'
top tip you can put a camera on the tripod and carry the tripod with it on it jus a lil tip for mark and or any newbies
Wade plays this game way too much by his level
Yesss phasmophobia!!!!!
YES FINALLY ANOTHER PAS ONE!  Edit: JESUS CRIST LIXIN THE MOONNNN
When bob said mark was smashing his head on the keyboard and then gave him a example of what he was doing, I swear to god I’ve never laughed that hard, I’m little crying because of how hard I’m laughing
Wade: “it’s still hunting”  Mark: “nah, no it’s not.”  Wade: *sacrifices himself bc he doesn’t want to deal with the ghost hunt alone.*   omg I missed the phasmophobia stuff 😂
cool
M.
I have seen your phasmophobia videos so many damn times and Im so glad yall came back to play the game again.
8:53 he got a high priestess but bcz it was hunting it was a fool 😭
Haven't seen the boys play in a while
CUT THE YELLOW WIRE!!!
I remember how Mark was the person to get me into Phasmo, and I've been following it ever since. It makes me happy to see him return to it after many many updates. I hope he'll do the same in the future, since the devs have a lot of cool stuff to put into the game!
Play more Phasmophobia
Dunno if he’ll see this 😂 but EY MARK You can put the camera on the tripod and still carry tripod around, frees up an inventory slot that way!
feel like the cards keep calling mark  a fool XD
Oh how I’ve missed Mark, Bob, and Wade playing games together!
This is the man who said Sips was bad at games
30:25 thats a pretty cool F13 easter egg ngl
This was so fun 😂 love that you all understand each others humor and just always go with it 🤣
why does Bob's character's face actually look like Bob
ahhaahhahaahah
when did they stream this?
Bro this is literally some of their best shit hahhah I'm dying
Mark is the player in a D&D Campaign that would draw a card from a Deck of Many Things, then keep drawing cards to fix all the problems he's causing by drawing cards.
Bob draws The Wheel Of Fortune, then dies. Wade then asked "What card did he draw?" Mark answers "Death.", Then proceeds to actually pull the card from the deck.
Try the VR version :)
19:52 lol
16:05 “It looks like a fake one.” My word! Brilliant description my ol’ chap! Now I know the difference! 🧐😆
So.. next time you go to the campsite... where that blair witch post is.. look back into the forest behind it. No reason.. No reason at all...
please make more phasmophobia videos! the wait for this one was a bit longer than i wanted
smol phasmo hack: when the ghost is hunting in most cases you can hide behind the OPEN door (between the door and the wall) and the ghost won't see you
What was that camping joke reference about?
OH MY GOD YES
I like how while in the camp Mark walked by a bouncing rolling soccer ball and paid it no heed on his way to the dock.
Been watching this man since 2014
Wade yeeting himself in front of the ghost so Mark has to go it alone had me in stitches x'D
I missed watching them three play Phasmophobia haaha.
Mark *Terrifed about dying Bob calmly commentates on his demise in a ghostly voice.
Get Jack in too :D
I am so excited that he played this again
Estuve esperando esto por tanto tiempo 😆
You guys should play to games like this more often
Is there any particular reason why mark isn't shutting the fuck up when he KNOWS the ghost is hunting?
Man you guys crack me up. You always lift my mood up =)
MY FAVORITE PEOPLE… PLAYING MY FAVORITE GAME?!?!!?
The neck snapping effects the editor added were top notch 👌
how did you get to a higher level without playing?
Hantu means ghost in malay
2:05 Jesus christ stop the presses, as if two hundred and eighty six wasn't a huge enough leap, now Wade's one thousand five hundred and thirty six, what he hell Wade, lmao
i need more phasmophobia PLEASE these always crack me tf up
I'm so glad the boys are playing Phasmophobia again, I missed this series!
I'm surprised nobody wanted to be Big Daddy in the Bus :O
"Lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare" can we fuckin not, my heart can barely take these as it is and I love phasmophobia. But this aside please do more Phasmophobia or bigfoot with Bob and Wade, I love these trio team videos!
I hope they play Sons of the forest when that comes out.
I love these videos so much, I hope y’all continue to play more Phasmo together as the game evolves!
You guys have to keep this series going! its my absolute favorite
Wade: “If you speak, the ghost will find and kill you” Mark: *proceeds to scream at top of his lungs whenever the ghost hunts and brings the ghost to him*
I really hope they make this into a longterm series. Ugh I just love these videos so much!
Omg yayyy i missed mark and the boys playing this game😁💕
also mark play fnf
The whole Wade camera nonsense put tears in my eyes, dear god 😂
you should so fucking react to phonophobia/lygrophobia its not a game to my knowledge but it is my phobia.
What's the Camping reference?
OMG YES MORE PHASMOPHOBIA
I've been waiting for so long for you guys to play this again   I would love to see more
the third might have been the twins if the the ghost appeared by the house. and there was a sighting at the campfire. But just an assumption. Twins are scary in a way. We found a spot where the twins were. But when a hunt happened. The hunter appeared in like the upper floor. and later in that exact room. We lost 2 people that day.
The "cursed item" just looks like a really cool phone case to me
That first ghost on Willow was totally a Banshee right? I mean, it ignored Mark and then went after Wade. Also watching Mark walk around with no camera on his tripod totally triggered me as a Nightmare player lol.
Please more of this game with bob and wade!!!! It’s my favorite🤗!!!
Yes! This is the type of content i I've been waiting for 🥳 i love it when these guys play Phantasmfobia or GTFO together😁
11:00 the whole bit with the coffee cup was hilarious but bobs comedic time right here is perfect 🤣
Video 126 of asking Mark to play the Mata Nui Online Game
"This feels like a safe place to be" idk why but that has me dying
You guys need to do more of this I'm pretty sure we all love it
ahhhhhhhh mark i missed your phasmophobia vids i hope you make mooooooore i loooooooooooooooove your vids keep being you also in space with markiplier is amaaaaaaazing keep making awwsome videos like these we looooooove you
Markiplier if you don’t know what the cursed objects do that you should probably look that up because the cursed objects can create something called a cursed hunt which is harder than the regular hunt so just look up the curse objects
love the ghost hunting xd so funny  🤣🤣
Just wait untill Mark sees that his "best friend" is in the forest as well. 😂
Hey finally a scary game again. I didn't think he would do anymore videos that everyone has always loved.
[Placeholder]
i'd love to see them play dbd
Loved the Friday the 13th reference
MARK JUST DRAWING CARDS AHAHAHAHAHA
Mark has yet to master the art of hide and seek
Between the Distractible Podcast and their videos these three righteous dudes break their backs to lift me out of my deepest and darkest depressions on a daily basis.
Oh thank God I have been wanting to watch mark do phasmophobia again
i love when they play this game
yesss more phasmo from mark it would be amazing if mark colabed with insym for a vid
I did not appreciate that s*xual activity! 😂🤣🤣😭
Hey mark here some tips turn all electronics once hunt begins even your flashlighr before yoy go to hide and avoid hidinf behind door avoid speaking during a hunt and curse items are used to summon ghost for evidence wouji board mirror voodo doll cards and music box
Mark: Oh I got bad news- *pulls more cards* I got bad news- *continues to draw cards saying he has bad news* Probably Wade: Shut up- Mark- shut up- stop talking-
wade is level 1,536... i think hes played this game too much
He made his return
Bob, Mark, Wade content???? :) not uno :(
1 day after release, 111k likes, 1,548,003 views, 3,807 comments, and user has 32.8m subscribers.
I love that they actually do a playthrough instead of just moments. This is my favorite scary game.
This is a better time than ever to go back and visit risk of rain 2.  Please Markiplier I'm begging
can it be? has wade's comedy changed? at 27:00 i was shocked, the stars had aligned, but there was nothing from wade they were at a camspite, there was a campfire, there was a guitar, wades character was a guy but there was no campfire guitar guy joke from wade
I was just trying to do my laundry  and they make an entire sex tape
Phasmophobia is baaack!! Yaay!
Damn! Mark could've saved Bob in the beginning with that high priestess!
now, to confirm if it is indeed a hantu, how big are the honkers?
Good ol bob ad wade
I love whatching you guys play this, it always makes me laugh.
I only wish I got to hear the Distractible ad they made on Wade and Bob's channels because seeing everyone's faces during that was priceless.
I just get so irrationally angry when mark talks when there’s a hunt
Jojo fans be like:  Death 13😮💀
Let's go it's back
that moon's jumpscare got me lmao.
"what card did he draw, death?" *draws death*
Loved the intro!
I was waiting for a Hantu Tetec reference but it never came.
There is a body underneath the camp house
Yes!!!! I just finished re-watching through the phasmaphobia playlist this is such perfect timing
Flip the fire switch baby
I love Mark just standing there as the hunt happens as if there is nothing he can do to protect himself. No hiding, no running lmao
i watched this video with my civics teacher during lunch, just thought that that was a pretty wholesome thing to share haha
PHASMOPHOBIA YESSSSS
We need more
when he turned the moon into a jump scare it actually scared me I'm such a chicken
Mark pls void train think about the rofleemo!!!
I was looking forwards to this!!  I miss their phasmo interactions.
Bobs ghostly passive "ohhhh nooo" as Mark died, just sent me
i hate the moon jumpscare
That was some bad gameplay... XD Hilarious, very Mark + Gang, but boi, get gud. Find those ghosties
I like how the devs put in references to the Blair Witch and Jason Vorhees
lol if you keeps on pinking up cards during hunts it'll always give you a fool card which literally does nothing. i would have been so mad if it was high priestess fool card...but i had fun watching this video lol
Lixian you a**hole, I wasn't expecting the moon to actually scare me lmaooo
i was wondering when this video would come out, but looks like youtube just didn't want to send me a notification
Yo when it came to the thumbnail I couldn’t tell if it was a donkey with a person on top of it or a girl
It's really fun to watch this and try to spot all the furniture that also got used in House Flipper
the last picture that was zoomed in on at the beginning is from the Villiska Axe Murder house. neat
It’s coming out of the house…I’m dead
Bro please more
Finallyyyyyyyy
It's sad that markiplier drew a high priestess while it was hunting, he could've saved bob
Play with insym
I love the new types of content showing up recently, in space, looking back on old stuff, etc. but this balance of the good old gameplay stuff is nice, props mark for alternating and keeping things fresh and entertaining
Yessssssssssssss it is back!!! Let's go boys
Lixian omg- bro I’m struggling and I’m like 3 mins in Many jump scares
32:08 I died laughing when Wade died.   Lol
"Arthur... do you have my back?"
"I got bad news! I got bad news!" *continues drawing cards* 😂😂😂
That intro was amazing
I could watch the gang play this game forever. Miss Sean though. He needs to get his behind back on.
“……tried to throw the cup at you mark”
You know with him like this i wish i can see him playing DMC5
Are we not gonna talk about them making Wade do naughty things without him realize
OHMYGOD ITSBAC K
25:43 Mark: John Madden  Me, an intellectual: UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Wade being level 1,536 in this video is the equivalent of when he was suddenly level 256
I want the hey everybody my name is markiplier back
I choose to believe I manifested this random Phasmaphobia content with my random thoughts about it
Ive waited so long for them to play this again
yeewsssss finally on phasmo
Not even 2 minutes in and bob almost gets up and runs away from his pc🤣🤣🤣🤣
not bob not getting the iswm reference 😞
How is Mark surviving any of this madness 🤣
Bob's "oh no" as mark is being killed at the end 😂
👻👻👻 boo❣
WHERES JACK????
did anyone else's brain go strait to gtfo when you saw the thumbnail
MARK PHASMO LESS GOO!!!!!
The only thing that went though my mind when I saw this was "YEAAAAAH"
You didn't think to mention that you drew the death card?
Hey mark use a black light in the, main room
"What card did he draw? death?" *draws the death card* "I got bad news"
12:25, well, I mean, he threw the cup though
I just plain love watching these guys have fun playing games and i dont even care what they're playing.  :>)yo
I can't believe the developers added the Hantu Tetek to the game lol. Maybe the developers are fans of Distractible.
I enjoy these videos I hope you guys play more of them.
Videos like these are why I like to watch markiplier. Keep the good work up
I'm sorry but the way mark drew the death card was so hilarious
Watching this after seeing Bob and Wade's channels. Still laughing my butt off! Cheers guys!
markiplier dingle
Just to put it out there, hantu is actually just a word for ghost in Malaysia or Indonesian, it's not like a specific thing😅😅 it's literally just 'a ghost'
Wow great intro
GOD!!! YEAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!! LUV THIS GAME
The moon jump scare some how got me
The part when Bob died and was throwing the coffee cup with Mark and Wade left was absolutely hilarious🤣🤣 and the editing was perfect, nice job Lixian!
mark: Hes fine mark 2 seconds later opens door and see bobs dead corpse
*GUYS* _ys_ *DID* _id_ *YOU* _ou_ *SEE* _see_ *THE* _the_ *GHOST?* _ost?_
Ok, so no one tell markiplier about she-hulk
how did mark not die after pulling a hanged man, dont make sense
I got an ad for a generator and was so confused. I’ve never wanted or looked up a generator, now I know why
Mark, please keep doing Phasmo videos. They made me so incredibly happy to watch and I really need some happiness in my life. Things are hard.
YESSS MORE PHASMOPHOBIA CONTENT. This puts me to sleep I love this stuff
I thought the moon jumpscare should have been moondrop (moonman) from security breach
As a regular phasmophobia player, I felt so tilted watching whatever mark was doing, especially how he wasted those tarot cards xD
OMG i was waiting to see u play back this game 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤯
I love how after you draw the death card everything else turns to the fool It's calling you a clown for thinking you can draw cards to get yourself out of that situation
i’ve been waiting for them to play this again i hope we get a few more episodes
Pls keep playing more of this game it’d be fun to see more ghosts and cursed objects explored
If only Sean was playing as well
Gotta love it XD *mirror breaks Wade: Welp now he's dead
I can't explain how much I've missed especially this game but really any game you three play together
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS, MARK PLEASE PLAY THIS MORE THE LAST ONES WERE Hilarious
That’s the best intro I’ve ever seen!
“It is wimdy inside. MOON!”  The fascination 🌝
Y'all remember when Yugi overkilled that mf with the glasses by constantly drawing cards? Yeah me too.
Tarot cards:  Fool: is a fake and will trick you. High priestess: next player who dies gets revived or revives all the dead players who are already dead. Tower: Ghost interaction. Death: starts a cursed hunt. Hanged man: kills the person who pulled this card. Hermit: freezes the ghost in place for a bit. Devil: Ghost Event. Sun: gives the player who pulled this card full sanity. Moon: drains the players sanity to 0%. Wheel of fortune: has a green and red mist color, Green gives the player 25% sanity, Red drains 25% sanity from the player.
We need so much more of this!!!
I hope they play the game again in the future
I am such a big fan of Mark and has been watching his content for an insane amount of time. For as long as i remember me and my brother would watch his videos! it would be so amazing if i got him to say hi to me and my brother ( Rachel and Aidan) .... hint hint. ( please)
He’s back to phasmophobia
So happy rn
Omg I'm so happy to see this kind of content again love watching you, Bob and wade play today
I need more Phasmophobia I love this series too much!!!!!!
32:06 I can't 🤣
I’ve been waiting for this video in so long 🥲
i love phasamophobia vids idk why
I wonder if they'll ever teach him how to actually play the game
That music score from 10:54 to 11:11 was fucking amazing lol
There planning to make a new update soon
Yayyy, while i do love distractible, its nice to see magnificent mark, bountiful bob, and wonderful wade in something other than a podcast (or in space)
holy crap omg we back with this game, nice
MARKIPLIER NEED TO PLAY IT IN VR
ive been waiting since wade and bob uploaded finallyyyy
hey I'm thinking of editing but I don't know how
YES MORE PHASMOPHOBIA
I think the devs should add a ghost called "No Ghost" and not tell anyone so when you are trying to get evidence there is just nothing.
WAS THAT THE LUNAR MOON JUMPSCARE!
I've always wanted him to continue the series. My wish has came true!
24:55 made me lose it. i don't know what it is about that stupid meme but it tickles me.
Wade exacts Vengeance on Mark for picking on him in Drunk Minecraft LOL
Mark: level 25, Bob: level 64, and of course, Wade: level 1,536. Wade is literally almost as much as bob's level times mark's level, which would be 1600. If only he had one more bob's worth of levels... lol 2:10
i need more watching you guys play this is always hilarious and a treat
19:10 scared the fuck out of me more than any actual spook in this game
Pulling the Priestess but it being during a huynt....damn...if only he waited
1:05 I got scared when I heard that noise 😂
How is Mark going to first draw the Death Tarot and *not* instantly get killed by the ghost? Talk about anticlimactic.
YAY Tomorrows my BDAY :D
i know there are puzzles and easter eggs in the lobby. (one requires you to get 666 hoop shots.) i also know that on the camp site map. you can spawn slender man. i dont know if he attacks you. but you will hear the iconic music. and he will be somewhere out of bounds in the woods. staring at you.
The moon scare actually got me I'm dissapointed in myself...
That fuckin moon startled me, lixian you fuck
Please do more Phasmophobia videos with Bob and Wade!
Is the camp a reference to Unus Anus
Mark should do this more, it is very fun to watch
I wanna see them playing this game become a ongoing series
The level can get that high? Jesus
Glad the phasmaphobia series continues wth a bang.
25:45 Nice Moon Base Alpha reference
OMG THIS IS WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR
Play moarrrrrr!!!!
the mark bob wade videos are my favorite😂 need more!
Hearing mark talk to lixian about the pictures on the walls was hilarious from Bob's point of view.
Bruh jacks not here
Lixian!!1!
Mark not hiding correctly was driving me NUTS omg
Yes! More phasmophobia please and make it a series
i was so happy to see the tarot cards when y'all walked into that house, was like, yessss. but no one drew the high priestess, so that's a bummer. really hope to see how y'all do when the Big Update happens
11:03 "Like Piccolo for Gohan" 🤣
I missed it and I am now the happiest man alive
Best intro ever 😆
Lixian has gotten really lazy
5:42 when Bob went "where are you" I immediately went "AND IM SO SORRYYY"  Good song reference, Bob
bob: "dear ghost where are you?" me jumping cause my name is ghost and I wasn't paying attention
So the campgrounds trip was an elaborate suicide right?
i feel like Mark is the conjurer of Chaos.
I can't wait for these guys to play sons of the forest thats gonna be great 😂
This entire episode is comedy gold omg. I missed this SO MUCH!
More of this please :)
YESSS NEW PHASMOPHIBIA IM PUMPED
i love when he was in the room and they were throwing things at him and he didn’t even register that it meant danger 😂
me: I am a man of culture and refined taste also me watching this video: haha game character has butt
"the power is in the basement we need to go down there anyways" >Dont bother turning on power or lights
PLEASE DO MORE OF THIS
this is probably my favorite game that these guys play together😂 the upgrade from “STOP THE PRESSES, WADES LEVEL 286” to “level 1,536🙄” 😂😂
I haven’t watched mark in a couple weeks cuz of work, and my first thought when I clicked the vid is “hey long hair mark is back!”
8:53 IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT MARK DRAWING THE RAREIST CARD. THE ONE CARD THAT COULD'VE REVIVED BOB. BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO HE HAD TO DRAW IT DURING A HUNT NEGATING IT'S AFFECTS.
YES!!!!
THEY ARE BACK!!!!
I saw the title and was so happy I loved this series so much and was happy there was a new episode, please keep making more!
Sean is sleeping with his cat he said he needed time without games
I understand, that Mark likes to mess around in games. But in this one, he is either just too dumb to understand what he is doing, or not trying at all.  It's really sad to watch, because I think he could be really good at Phasmo, if he took it a bit more seriously (or actually listened to Wade). Still not sure if this is him actually trying to play the game, or him just messing around with his friends.
Who knew this game was actually "Porn Director Simulator 2022"?
OMG AHAHAHA,Wades voice at the end is so agressive
Omg I’m so glad you’re playing this again
I missed this series
YES i love phas i wanted more from mark
this trio never fails to make me laugh, and nice; its been a while since phasma lol, still an awesome game
10:54 what is this song called? I require it for my dnd campaign
Hooray
That’s not how the mimic works. The mimic mimics other ghosts ABILITIES NOT evidence.
That skeleton in the locker literally fell like if he just had fainted. He said he was done with life lol.
please upload these more!!! i love these videos
Ok but what about mine craft? Will Mark keep playing Minecraft it not anymore 🥹?
That "John Madden" bit blasted me back. It's been so long since i've thought of moonbase alpha and all the shenaniganry it entails.
I don't know if this ghost exists already, but there should be a ghost that can kill at any activity level besides level 0, but gives the most clues and clear clues.
Nah they couldn’t see themselves in the pics cause they vampires
please make more of this content,   love your fellow fans
Mark did you know in the lobby before you start a investigation there is a black light you can pick up and you should look around with it
Lol 😂 OMG I just figured out what the thumbnail actually is! I thought it was a demon goat in front of a lady standing up! It’s a woman upside-down!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
So happy these video's are back 😁
I love watching you play horror with bob and wade
as many times as I've watched them play this game ... I still have NO CLUE what this game is about lmao
NOT MARK CONTINUOUSLY DRAWING CARDS FROM THE CURSED FUCKING OBJECT TAROT CARD LMAO.
I absolutely loved when Bob and Mark were messing with Wade by making him look up and down.
We need more
I already knew what was going to happen when you walked up to that door,  and I still freaking jumpped
I have missed your videos!
Nice to see Phasmophobia again, one of my favorite series of Mark with Bob and Wade.
It makes me sad that Bob and Wade don't remember or haven't seen such an iconic piece of the internet. And to Mark, I say AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
The tarot cards are my favorite cursed item because they have a chance of reviving a dead teammate. In fact, Mark got the card (The High Priestess) that would have revived Bob, but he used it during a hunt so it turned into The Fool, which gives you nothing.  :(
You can tell that even beyond their natural goofy friendship energy, their practiced synergy from doing Distractible together every week is really bleeding into this. The guys work really well together, and their comedic timing, especially Bob's when he's really on it, are just **chef's kiss** bellissimo
Not even 2 mins in and already I feel Lixian is at least 4 wage increases short Lixian has an extra mouth to feed now Mark! Gib the Lixy the Risey in Wagey? I need an extra beer xD
Wade: You can hold the mirror but if it breaks the Monster immediately hunts. Bob: Mark pick it up. Mark: SURE!!!  Love it!!
24:55 two Bs? how? 🖤🤍
mark needs to play scp labrat with jack bob and wade. what a great vr port of containment breach
YES!!! Everyone's been waiting for you to play this again! So excited

the moonw as scarier than the game
>Mark draws the last card, and it's the Hanged Man Uh oh. >Ghost starts hunting Uh oh.
Omg ive been waiting for this!!!!!!
Barbara from Uno appears as a ghost and kills wade "Barbara!"
LETS GOO!! THEYRE BACK PLAYING ONE OF MY FAVOURITE GAMES!!  All thats left now is for them to play Fall Guys and my life is complete (pls)
What's Bob's channel name?
I LOVEEEEEE MARK-WADE-BOB GAMING VIDS
I wonder how high wades level
I think it's actually camp crystal lake o-o
Whats the name of the meme sound/song at 24:56? Thanks!
So nobody's gonna talk about *LordMinion777* level :/
The boys messing with Wade while he was in the bedroom has me giggling
we need like a 2 hour edition of phasmophobia
Yesssp
Fact: Hantu literally translate to Ghost in Bahasa Melayu
Im so glad there's more phasmophobia content
Dude the series with Mark, Bob, and Wade are my favorite things to binge I’m so glad this is back!
5:18 It's going to be Majoras mask...isn't it
i love this game so much
THANKYOU FOR BRINGING BACK THIS SERIES, KEEP IT UP!!!😄
more pls
They have to look in the woods behind the Blair witch stick figure and they'll see an old friend.
Hantu is literally ghost in bahasa 👀
you can put the camera on the tripod even u're inside the van, in that way, u can bring one more device :> tho, u have to equip the tripod w/ cam or else, the tripod would drop. Also, u need to turn off ur flashlight so u can observe in night vision of the cam better :>
Please more phasmaphobia <3
I can't believe they're back to my favorite horror game! Always wanted to see them playing on the current version
just realized Bob, Mark, and Wade can equate to the BMW crew, whaddya know.
"The Fool" Mark, I think the game was making fun of you.
1:37 i wonder what eef would do to that skeleton
Mark and Bob having 2 digit level while wade chilling with 4 digit
More! I NEED MORE!
13:24 My boy turned into Woody x the kid from hello neigbor lol😂😂😂
Pulling a High Priestess during a hunt :pensive:
Is it just me, or markiplier is looking kind of THICC 0:15
“And, now he’s dead” great line
The Jumpscare worked. Godd job
omg 32:13 I....DIED! hahahahahahaha that curdling scream lmfao
he drew a goddamn priestess but the ghost was hunting so it didn’t work
finally the day has come!!! I've waited for this moment for 1 year
Waiiitt, is there a setting where you can talk with the people who are alive as a ghost???
My favorite is the tarot cards, the good, the bad, and the spooky 👻
😀😃
If your sanity with the mirror reaches 0, it breaks. Once it does the ghost hunts.
Imma be real with you. Wait till Raiju
Please do more phasmaphobia
A NEW UPDATE EDITION OF MARK PLAYING THIS?!?!
Fuck yeah. Love seeing the dynamic trio flying once again
somewhat near the campfire next to the fence.
I literally choked when I saw Wades level.
6:03 The subtitles are not accurate.
If markiplier doesn't play this game more often I might as well kill myself.
Mark you’re awesome
I need to see more lmaooo
Was literally just watching the phasmaphobia playlist!!! Thanks so much for the new video, Mark! <3
32:15 Bob's comedic timing of his gostly voice couldn't have been better.
Keep playing this! Seriously mark, I love this game and you playing it with the guys is just a MASSIVE bonus!
15:25
Howdy camper! Looks like you made it just in time....
Hantu is a Malay word for ghost...idk what type of ghost is that..hantu can be anything..
11:02 In an completely unexpected act of pure heroism and selflessness, Wade sacrifices himself by getting in the way of the *Terrifying-Horrofying-Spooky-Scary-Malevolent-Malicious-Evil-Vicious-Violent Ghost©* to save Mark (who by the time was *CLEARLY* and *UNDENIABLY* paralized out of pure fear), not before using his final breath to tell Mark about how he will have to go walk the path of life alone from now on. F for this fallen hero.  That ragdoll tho, 10/10 would cry again.
Been waiting for this a long time
this trio makes everything so fun. GTFO, Phasmophobia and Distractible are so entertaining!
The hantu te tek
Did anyone notice the creepy shadows of Mark on the wall of the house at 13:42
Wade: No take me! Mark: Wade?? Wade: You're on your own Mark- *dies*
The only people i still enjoy playing this game, cus it's fun even when nothing's happening
You guys gotta do more!!!
Lixian is the best
Bob just throwing the cup had me dead🤣🤣
Mark: *Draws a card* Death Also mark: BAD NEW BAD NEWS *Continues drawing cards*  He's like every party ever that gets a Deck of Many Things in D&D
I saw the Jason mask and got happy😂
number 1 rule: dont die mark we need u ok
More Phasmophobia!!!!!
Pre haircut 🥺
Yes!!!! I'm so happy to see more of this I love it!
I’m dead he literally said “your on your own mark” Maekiplier” what do you mean” gets neck snapped
I’m so glad you returned to this game
Aww the john madden references and the space reference. Literally had the audio playing in my head every time he said that XD
I loved watching you play phasmo and it’s been like a year and I’m so excited your revisiting it
Did no one else not get a notification for this video?
Seeing the coffee cup drop in front of Mark as he was dying was hilarious.  Poor Bob tried so hard.  xD
why is his luck so good and bad? he got the priestess while a hunt and got hanging man while a hunt.
Oh my god please more of this gold
when i saw mark drew the priestess during the hunt i got a tad bit excited but then i realized he drew it during a hunt turning it into the fool card-
*OMG HE’S SPEAKING TO US* 🤯
please do more phasmaphobia
Yayyyy Phasmo is back!
YESS I LOVED THHIS SERIES
YESSSSSSS. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
I hope this games become popular again, it’s fun to play and watch ^^
Can't wait to watch our Head Engineer, Wug and Burt work together to find ghosts in phasmophobia
Wow, it has been a hit minute since I have even seen a video, that last "video" I watched was in space with Markiplier, having said that, it's good to be back
This is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games for me to watch you guys play, which says something, because Mark/Wade/Bob/Sean (or any permutation thereof) gaming sessions are always gold. I freakin love this game, and the updates are sweet.
more of this more of this more of this
5:19 That got me. I thought it was going to be a another joke jump scare. I believe this thing will also trigger Mark's Trypophobia.
Fun fact: One of the pictures on the board that Lixian zoomed in on is a picture of Betsy Aardsma, who was murdered in the library at Penn State University. The murder is still unsolved
I’ve listened to so much Distractable that this feels like an episode
YES PHASMOPHOBIA IS BACK!
YAY PHASMO AGAIN
Yay I was waiting for more Phasmaphobia
Is that deck a JoJo reference
Me and my friends are all almost level 500, we got all of said levels before the big updates, we came back to the new update and have barely completed a full match on any mode other than intermediate since. (We didn’t know you had to turn your lights off during a hunt)
Friday the 13th reference lol 30:24
Is told the ghost can hear them talk, proceeds to talk EXTRA LOUD during a hunt lol
I fucking love seeing these three goof off together.
omg a PHASMOPHOBIA video!!!!!!!!
Watched this from bobs pov and it's so funny that Mark literally tells Lixian how to edit it so naturally in voice chat
Mark: lv 100 on GTFO Wade: lv 1500 on phasmaphobia
I think it would be so fun to carry Mark through a game. Like seriously, set it to nightmare and you can only win if you finish the match with Mark still alive. If he dies everyone surrenders to the ghost.
Thanks Lixian for the very scary jumpscares in the beginning of the video!
this man was just trying to do the moonbase alpha john madden bit and wade was SO confused don't worry mark, someday they will do it with you
I feel like there was a missed opportunity with Bob's "Owen Wilson WoW"
I think you also should play Dead by Daylight, it's been a while and there were very many updates since you played it last time.
Oh man, if they're playing Phasmophobia again, a collab with Insym would be amazing. He's basically a MASTER of the game. And I totally suggest playing Ghost Hunters Inc. [Same genre of Phasmo, but focused on exorcising the ghost instead....and it can break down your doors ;)]
I love how wade just went "No! Me! You're on your own now mark!" Not even a little bit of fear in his voice.
In Malaysia, Hantu basically means ghost- so I'm not sure which hantu they're using for the ghost-
im legendary
Slow speed aswell
Between door and curtains
I've missed seeing them play this ❤
6:57
I've been waiting for this!!! It's do good to see u guys play this again
If you go to 6:58 the shadow on the wall makes it look like there is a ghost looking at them
FINNALLY YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IV BEEN WAITING FOR YALL TO DO THIS AGAIN
YAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
PHASMAPHOBIA YESS
Another remarkable intro. As silly as usual, Mark.
wade: "No, me" also wade: "Your on your own mark" mark: ? oh
anyone know what this sound effect is? 24:55
24:37 *breathes in* AHHHHHHHHHH! ITS TIME FOR THE SCOUT’S OATH!
Nice
FINALLY! Waited so long for this!
It’s the *ghostly voices* at the end for me
wow i miss this outro
My face when he wasted a high priestess during the hunt. XD
Bob's character looks like a short emo version of Shane Madej too me XD
Insane it's back
11:07
Love that These guys are doing more of this game!
Whenever i saw this i never clicked onto a vidio so fast
Ah so he drew death, that’s why another hunt started xD
Was it me or did Bob and Wade have their own channels a few years ago?
yeees phasmo is back ive been waiting for more
TW Jumpscares
YES! more please Mark! *MOREEEE*
please be a new series
Wade sacrificed himself to save Mark and if thats not true friendship then I don't know what is
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Is this a new SERIES!??
This video popped up in my notifications and i had a long gasp, so excited
It would’ve been funny if markipler looked at the mask in the lake and said Ayo wassup Jason
Bob - Dies from Mark talking Wade @ 10:48 - As the PICOLLO to Mark being GOHAN (You're on your own now, Mark!) ... aaaand then moments later wasting his anime plot armor and friendship sacrifice ... Wade - you did great... but do better :D  This hurts my ribs 🤣
Beatboxing isn’t cool anymore it’s “spiritboxing” now
I played Roblox phasmophobia
Very disappointed in Bob and Wade for not getting the Moonbase Alpha reference Mark was making.
if you draw cards while the ghost is hunting it will give you the fool card which makes the card you drew into nothing   and you got high priest which gives you a second life
Yes finally it's back this is one of my favorite video
Mark:"lixian make the moon a jumpscare" Me: well here it comes...i know it's coming....it's right... *Jumpscare happens*, Me: *still jumps at it and audibly screams at the screen*
please play little nightmares 2 :))
Bruh he got the 2% card and the 1% card 8:52 2% 9:09 1%  That the percent i think of them two
Pls continue this series I loved your series on phasmophobia.
Super happy that there's another Phasmophobia video by Mark. I honestly love his content, especially Phasmophobia.
You’re on your own now mark. Then turns around and dies
Game play
Pls
Bendy Ink machine
I found something odd here. Hantu mean ghost. why you named ghost ghost, its a category
finallY!
The part that got me most was:  Bob, throw the coffee cup at me if I’m about to die. *nothing* Okay I think I’m good. *lights go off* *coffee cup flies in* *Mark screams*
where’s jackkkk:(((
Huh, hantu is just "ghost" in malaysia
I love how Mark completely forgot to play and was reduced to day one of him playing this game, running around with a camera, gathering no evidence and screaming XD
Yessss I’ve been waiting for more episodes of thisss
Omg another phasmophobia video yeeeeeeee
Do more of the game please
Mr. Plier --- You own a VR , why have you NOT Playing this in VR. it's So Much Worse. So good.
I love Mark’s Phasmo videos when he adds the extra creepy music to the game video.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS IVE BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS VID MY WHOLE LIFE
havent watched it yet (i will later >:]) but mark is going WILD with the video updates & streams
I still don't get over the fact that the camp site map looks like Freddy fazbear
Oh wow I can't believe it! They're finally playing Phasmophobia again!
Should you turn all equipment off when it's hunting. i think ghost senses all electrical devices that is turned on
Its nice that they played phasmabophia again
lets goooo
1:54 why does wade's character low-key look like a JoJo character from the side?
hey! always had a feeling phasmophobia would come back on this channel!
Yay I’m so happy watching him play phasmaphobia again
Mark if you draw death it activates a cursed hunt. During a cursed hunt you can’t use the cards
the dumbest thing you can do is to give bob the death cup
No. Me. You’re on your own Mark
jesus christ, that moon jumpscare lmao
I hope they teach you about the radio on the lobby one day
i didn't know i needed new phasmophobia videos
Mark got so frikn lucky when he pulled hang man and then it turned to the fool.
Lol why don’t you guys hide when the ghost is hunting ? In a closet, behind something in a different room. Turn off your flashlights. Lol just standing in the room where the ghost has already killed, and not hiding…. Equals death lol 😂
PHASMO IS BACK
Mark, I love you
Amazing
32:05
I see the effort has become ego lazy and decay with easy echo's ..
does anyone know where the john mandden(?) reference is? i swear i heard it somewhere..  timestamp: 25:46
"We got a busy few months ahead of us.. So why not kick this camp off with a scary story?" Love that reference.
Didn’t see this until late night, so I had to wait until the morning to watch 😂
I want to see you all play that in VR
10/10 intro
...you still haven't grabbed the UV light on the HQ shelf and gone around there? Disappointed.
First newer video of yours i've managed to get myself to watch and really happy I did. I missed watching your channel. Now that I know there's little to no iswm advertising before vids I feel far less terrified and/or anxious ill get triggered again. The phasmo updates were great.
Who else was expecting to hear a  "tetek" every time "Hantu" was mentioned? ;)
3:57  That sounded so much like Owen Wilson, what the actual hell.
I love watching mark sh!t his pants while I have a broken thumb
5:16 "Lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare" *me eating food* "OH FUCK SHIT FUCK SHIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" *dies*
31:13 This moment was amazing it's her-ITS HERE!!
CUT YOUR HAIR!!
I love you guys!!!!!!!!!!
Finally more of this
Finally they’re backkkk
Hello
Mark: frantically drawing Tarot cards    Me: "I name your stand...STAR PLATINUM!!"
So glad the boys went back to some Phasmo.... I've rewatched the old videos more times than I can remember.
Lmao level 1,536🌝
john madden
We always love chaos🙃😈
The chaos because mark return..
YEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
ive been watching the phasmaphobia playlist on repeat for DAYS bc yall were funny . glad to see a comeback !
The moon from Majora's Mask... Good times.
Mark has a new outro
"Why was it all the way here" Yeah, its almost as if the ghost roams, and doesn't stay in one spot
Markiplier pls do more phasmophobia
Love the Majora's mask reference thank you mark and lixian for making me laugh
I was literally re-watching alll of the old phasmo clips like 2 days ago! This is awesome mark.
What’s the song at 10:55? The editors use of it in the video was fuckin amazing.
It’s so good so see mark returning to games he used to play and have fun
WADE'S SCREAM AT THE END- HAHA-
YESSSSSSSSSSS A NOTHER PHASMOPHOBIA FROM MARK YEEEEEEEHHHHHH!
Please play or at least look at this horror game called, “in sound mind” it is so dope I saw Eddie playing it and it gives a whole new horror feel and stuff kinda reminds me of resident evil and amnesia.
It was awesome when wade turned around and just said "You're on your own ,Mark"
Yeay this gonna fun!😄
High Priestess near Bobs Body would have gotten him up!
I missed these videos
PLEASE WE NEED MORE
Noice. Been waiting for marky to revisit this game... Also wade sacrificing himself was beautiful
Yeeeey finally you play Phasmophobia again!!!!
I've been waiting for so long
Love when they play this game… it’s actually so entertaining:))
*Coffe cup gets thrown towards Mark* *Intense music starts playing as Mark begins to panic*
Dang...wade plays this game more than completive players play their games. I think he needs help.
I feel like they should’ve included Sean… but it’s still funny when it’s just the three of them Idk what I’m trying to say here…
Cool video
13:24 mark zucc
this game is so cool
You should play Ghost Exile
Hantu? Hey thats 'Ghost' In Indonesian Language
YES MARK FINALLY HEARD OUR REQUESTS! LOL WE CAN THANK BOB FOR HELPING US!
Are they ever going to add the ability to exorcise the ghost after identifying it?
Yes we need more of this
why didnt i get a notification ;p
PHASMOPHOBIA IS LITERALLY MY FAV SERIES!! TYSM MARK, WADE, AND BOB.
Team feels so empty without jack
Things that will help you: Turn off anything electrical in your hand during a hunt Don't talk during a hunt The mirror will break, when your sanity reaches 0 The little music box will make the ghost sing louder, the nearer you are. But don't let the ghost touch it, it will start a hunt. You have to say Goodbye to the ouija board now.
"MARK UGUAHUGUAUGHAUGHAUGHAUHGUAHGU" ":..BAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA"
Not wade’s character in the first 20 seconds literally rearranging every connection in his spine just to point out a small missable feature in the game
The best youtuber
ah yes, the epic trio back in a horror game. nothin could go wrong
I love phasmophoia so much. I really hope there's more coming!.
What's the camper story Mark referenced? I am confusion
Seeing Wade's sacrifice in the first game from all the different perspectives was great, he really said "fuck this shit I'm out"
So happy you guys are playing this again, the group dynamic makes it 👌👌
OMG MARK PLEASE PLAY YANDERE SIMULATOR AGAIN OMG PLEEEEEEAAAAASSSSEEEEE
22:57 just the sudden abrupt chaos absolutely killed me
More pls!
Seeing this was really cool, it's been a while since I saw you make a video one these and it was probably one of my favourite series, please make more of these again!
I luv this gameeee
wait why does mark have long hair did i miss something or what
LETS GO BOYSSSSSSS (i know im late asf ;-;)
OOOHHH YEAHHH! THE BOYS ARE BACK!
i love when marks uploads phasmophobia
Lol dev want to put ghost from all around world and Malaysia and Indonesia get hantu 😂😂
i watched all of his old phasmophobia videos yesterday lol
*Mark's neck  gets snapped  Bob in a muffled voice: "ʷᵉ ᵗʳᶦᵉᵈ ᵗᵒ ᵗʰʳᵒʷ ᵃ ᶜᵘᵖ ᵃᵗ ʸᵒᵘ"
11:06 that was a cinematic masterpiece. That was legit funny first and it was terrifying.
25:32 The walking sound effect sound familiar... where is it from..
why dont they give ghost hunter guns,yeah maybe bullets shoot through,but if you shoot at something and it dont die it probably because you didnt shoot it ENOUGH.
Alright someone help me out here I feel I'm missing something. What was Howdy camper about? XD
I like how mark did a whole series on this game and remembers literally nothing about it.
mark please play project zomboid! its a really cool open world survival sandbox game with a DANG TON OF DETAIL! from simple things like grass growing, zombies decaying, etc. to mapwide erosion (cracks appearing in buildings, nature coming into cities and mapwide water/electricity shutoff) working weather reports, character customization with traits, multiplayer (from playing with friends to servers with up to 32 people but a fairly recent update brought 100 player servers. They likely will be very buggy tho), steam workshop support and even a storyline in radios and tv's (you can literally observe the world going from one state going byebye to the entire world going into apocalypse, with radio/tv reports shutting off entirely after that) and, my favourite. you barely get any plot armor. All it takes is one bite and you're dead (not really, you will become a zombie tho)
8:27 **draws the death card** "I got bad news, I got bad news"  **desperately draws even more cards and they all turn into the fool** "I GOT BAD NEWS, I GOT BAD NEWS!"   And that's why you don't mess with the Deck of Many Things 🃏
Aahhh a break for the captain and a break for mark in gaming and lixian is back!
Finally I am blessed with another phasmophobia I miss these vids!
Heyhey hey don’t start thinking you’re too good for intros say freaking hello to us 😤 rude -3-
My all day watching and listening to the old episodes has finally worked! 🙌 YES!!
eyeeeeeeeeeees
Please recontinue this series
Mark throwing ISWM references on the scout boys is golden
I actually got jumpscared by the moon altho we were warned about it HAHHAHAHA
Super happy they got together to play phasmo again lol been rewatching lately getting my screaming fix xD
am i wrong or is the camp refrence a refrence to unus annus? ( sorry for my spelling)
I've been looking forward to this
Am I the only one that finds this guy weird
I had my first paranormal experience tonight so this is cool to have popped up in my recommended right away
Where's Lixian?
i just realised but "Hantu" literally just means ghost in malay 😂😂
I’m so excited for his daily uploads again :D he’s gone from doing something he loves, and then BACK to what he loves to do!
YEAHHHHH ITS BACK
I must see the terror in his eyes when he finds a new ghost
I hope he does this again
I wasn’t actually expecting a jump scare when mark looked at the moon. Damn you Lixian!
10:09 I have no idea why but this just killed me
Shit, I had missed Phasmaphobia.
OMG OMG I have been waiting for you guys to play Phasmophobia again for YEARS. I have rewatched your Phasmophobia videos so so many times hoping you'd do it again FUCK YES
Markiplier play evil dead the game
OMG YEAHHH!!! MY FAVORITE
I love videos with Bob and Wade. It's like they each have 1 brain cell separated but when they come together they have to share half of one, it's great.
Mark is like an old friend I can always seek comfort in
Wow that was a good intro
This is already scary enough  Oh wait no it had to be 3 am and sirens going on
I think he forgot that taking will get him killed 🫡
YASSSSSSS ITS BACK I LOVE THESE VIDEOS
Omg yesssssssssssssss
I don't know who you are but my oldest daughter watches you. You sir, curse too much. That is not being a good influence. My daughter has been watching you since she was twelve. If I knew how much you curse then, I would no way allow her to listen to your filthy mouth. Have a good day, sir.
ayoo more phasmophobia!!! i love this series
YES
Hey mark, have seen She Hulk trailer yet? I would love to see your reaction. I think, She is your type.
did the taking-advantage-of-wade's-'innocence' joke make anyone else uncomfy? like i know it was a joke it just was a bit triggering
Level 1536
I WATCH YOUR OLD PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEOS LETS GOO THIS IS INCREDIBLE, PLEASE MAKE MORE MARK 💪 ILY AND YOUR FRIENDS /P
Moon jumpscare thanks for the adrenaline
Mark: *draws card* Also mark: I GOT BAD NEWS wade: WHAT DID YOU DO- 8:28
Those Tarot Cards are pretty cool.
Yaaaay so much good content lately~~
Wade's at a casual level 1536
been too long since everyone got a cinematic manly scream from mark in this game.
"The ghost can hear you when it's hunting" Mark: *literally says every single word in the Oxford, Scrabble, and Urban dictionary*
24:55 I love you lixian
Friendly reminder to not pull cards during a hunt. Also, the High Priestess card could have revived Bob if you weren't pulling them in a hunt.
After bulding the warp core and almot destroying everything he has the *audacity* to play video games and pretend nothing happend
Great video mark! I love every new video you make, you never disappoint :D
YES  YES YOU DID MORE
Thank you for continuing one of my favorite game series.
Yay mark with his friends
The entire scene leading up to Wade's death was perfect
Mark saying “no.” As soon as bob and wade explain not to talk when it’s on the hunt and it ends up killing bob
I’m so glad the phasmophobia series is back! This series is hilarious,terrifying and has these three dorks making it even more Better!
missed this kind of vids
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Oh my god I missed this
Hantu? Indonesian ghost?
yessssssss！
that moon jumpscare absolutely destroyed my eardrums,, thanks lixian!
More!!11!1!!!1!11!!!!1!!1
I love horror game specially this type.
A ghost opens the door, walks in, and sees a man with a flashlight doing a lap dance, what does it do? It runs away as fast as possible
Nobody gonna talk about mark getting upset and mocking bob at 25:06
Revenant Gaming
the way i didnt get this fucking notif
I'm surprised Mark lived as long as he did.
The well awaited sequal
MOREEEEE
It's so weird seeing him play normal games after making a whole movie
Now I can finally see the edits he said
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR SOOOOO LONGGG DUDE
Yeah no they almost completely reworked the game since the last time they played together lol
I didn’t understand the camping reference, can someone please explain? 😅
so funny XD
YES more people playing this lovely game :D
I’m so happy this series is back
WE MISS THIS 😁😁😁😁😁
I really don’t know why people like this game. It just seems totally random as to what happens and you’ve got zero protection against anything. Nothing makes any sense and everything you use, place or throw into the rooms seems utterly pointless. The only reason to watch this specific vid is cuz Mark is entertaining .. but man this game seems stupid and boring.
18:00 This got really kinky really fast
YEAAHHHHHHHHHH I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU.        no homo
Hantu is Malay or Indo version of ghost. Usually women who have wrongfully murdered by jerks.
THE ADRENALINE THAT SHOT THRU ME WHEN I SAW THIS ON MY HOME PAGE!!!!! IM SO FUCKING HAPPY RN FINALLY THEY CAME BACK
Mark and Wade communicating to a dead Bob via a silent moving coffee cup is so much funnier to me than it should be
More
*Alternate title : Markiplier,bob,wade being comedians for 33 mins*
FUCK YES! finally a new phasmophobia vid
11:02 Did Wade just heroically sacrifice himself for Mark?
Best day ever. Got my first ever job at 15, At Mac Donald's, I turned 15 on the 18th of April And mark posts a Phasmophobia. So best day of my life, Thank you mark!
Lixian is very professional with the jumpscares this time ;3 But mark was just going crazy with all the Tarot cards and i loughed as he had the reviving card xD
Sea of thieves with the boys
Lezgoooo another phasmaphobia video
I've been so excited for more Phasmophobia 👻 Time zones make it kinda hard to watch your videos as soon as they come out, but I'm always excited to watch them when I wake up/get home from school 👻
20:36 Is that the Hantu Tatek, the big boobed monster from the Distratible podcast?
I love when Mark plays with Bob and Wade, always a good time. You can really tell Mark seems rested up too
Omg Bob and wade just died 😆
I got freaked out when Mark approached that door
Thanks Lixian for the moon jumpscare Really helped dial in the volume on my headphones
Did nobody see that wade's level is 1535
The vr clipping still works btw
Pekaboo
Jack didn't get the memo
2:47 is that Matthew Perry?
Mark quick question how is darkiplier doing
after fnaf phasmaphobia was one of the best series from markiplier i have watched the old ones for like 5 times i hope he puts more of the game especially after all of these updates
Fun fact: hantu is basicly ghost in indonesian (i'm so sorry with my grammar)
thank you for playing phasmophobia again! me and my older brothers love this game and i was sad when you stopped playing it!
Moree🤣
CAN YOU DO PHASMOPHBIA WITH BOB AND WAD
Wait am I dumb? What’s the “howdy camper” thing mark referenced ?
Are we gonna have Camping With Mark?
Nice to see the gang playing with ghost again
Wade: “it can hear you when it hunts so you have to be carefull” Ghost: *hunts* Mark: i’ve got bad news, i’ve got bad news, AAAAAAH, i’ve got realy bad news, AAAAAAH, AAAAAAH!
Still always funny 😏
Please make more of this!! I loved the original phasmophobia series you did and I would love to see you guys play more! Also you guys should play with Sean as well. That would be amazing!
More phasmo! I love it!
Btw Mark in the camping map by the campfire if you look past the fence into the out of bounds slenderman will be there if the campfire's lit
I’ve missed this and I want more!!!! Thanks for bringing it back
1:57 Getting Over It Diogenes
alternate title "Bob,Mark and Wade being gay througout the video"😆
Have you tried getting 666 points in the basketball thingy     It’s a secret
I wanted more phasmo so badly
This is my comfort Markiplier series. My fall asleep playlist just got longer
Day 1 of Asking Markiplier, can I ask you to play a Roblox Horror game?    Can you play the Mimic Book 2 (or book 1 for less spooks and quality)
Is it counted as a intro or is there still no more intros
Mark pulling the high priestess during a hunt nearly made me scream
5:15 ok ok.. That got me.
the boys are back AYY
That tarot deck looks *awesome*, and of course Mark wasted it, lmao. "OH, NOTHING, WHAT DOES THE NEXT CARD DO?"
I like the design of the tarot cards. I want them irl
Lol i find this funny, hantu in Indonesian/Malay just means "ghost" so like, which kind doe hahaha phasmophobia is a "hantu" buster game
mak play live on plasmaphobia
Oh how I've missed this trio playing Phasmophobia, I hope we get a couple more videos!
The mirror is a Ringu reference.
I died on the inside when Mark drew a High Priestess card during a hunt XD
I've missed Phasmophobia :)
pov you drop the soap in prison “somthings in my ass… ooooooh ooooooooo
yus the bois bak
So glad to see you three playing this game again!!!
Now the only thing missing is for them to also continue their Raft series and heaven will be achieved
PLEASE PLAY THIS MORE 😭🫶🏻 I manifested this the other day alot to play since all the updates 💀
1:08 Mark meets Lisa.
32:05 Best part. Love how Wade died here. My sides hurt from laughing so much🤣
Phasmo is an awful game for Mark to play since being quiet is not in his vocabulary 🤣🤣
9:33 Bob smelling some good weed
wow they added a ghost with malaysian name that literally means ghost so... great
ANOTHER VIDEO 📹 IS COOL BUT MR STILL NOT FINISHED WITH STANLEY
Bruh their ghost was a hantu. The flabbergasted phantasm. The giggity ghost.
MORE LET ME CONSUME MORE
Mark reminding me he hasn’t done an intro in a long time.  “Fine. I’ll do it myself”. “Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome back to Amnesia The Dark Descent” 🫡🫡🫡
I have waited so long for phasmaphobia
I like how the cards kept turning into the fool after mark had already drawn death, like “nope, not changing your fate here”  Also death in tarot rarely means actual death, it more symbolizes change.
happy your back on this game Mark!
I was lookin' for some spooks, glad I found them~
Please Mark play more of this I love the content so much
Day 2 of asking mark to play Bugsnax! :)
YEAH!!! I’VE MISSED THIS GAME SERIES!!!!
That moon jumpscare fucking got me
Finally back with some more phasmophobia!
less go
did mark not notus the soccer ball
3:19 Cougars don't exist in missions.
hantu??? just hantu??? bro the devs didnt even go beyond the specific ghosts??? come on which hantu, there's so many
please play amanda the adventurer
They REALLY need to try this game in vr
Freezing tempatures in the woods? Who would have tought
I’ve missed them playing this game!!!!! This and raft
The fact that Mark kept drawing the Fool and didn't stop gibbering as he did so-
lixian turn this comment into a jumpscare
"the ghost can hear you" Mark: *starts screaming everyword in the english dictionary*
We need jack mark and pewds to play it would be legendary
Saw Jason's mask in the water, that campground map must be a Friday the 13th X Phasmophobia Collab map 🤔😮
finally
You 3 should play it in VR together
insym is lv 8000
The gang’s All here Like the old times.
*dying* That whole chain of events with Mark telling Bob to throw the cup at him if he's about to die. Nothing. Then hunting and cup. Then Wade steps in like "No me." *LOOKS DIRECTLY AT MARK* "You're on your own Mark" "whatdoyoumeanOHGOD!" So much good
yes.. just yess
fun fact, hantu is just ghost in malay
Heres a tip when the ghost is hunting there is hiding spots like boxes that you can hide behinde them or closets and lockers also turn off your flashlight before you hide
Phasmophobia returns! Whoo-- WAIT! 3:53: There's Onryo in this game now? Oh no...
Yeahhh baby!
Lol hantu is pretty much ghost in Malay and Indo
FINALLY Mark plays!! Whats funny is that I've been watching so many insym vids lately and then watching Markiplier finally play Phasmo again. Just omfg night and day lmfaooo
Hantu is literally mean ghost in malay.
im beginning to see why mark is lvl 25 XD
Bob: { *pulls from the Deck of Many Things, dies for his arrogance* } Mark: "Oh it's big brain time." { *pulls Death card, then proceeds to pull every other remaining card from the Deck of Many Things, confusing it to the point where it just starts calling him a Fool, having no other strategy for this course of action* }
many many updates
Mark! My sister and her Friends did the EXACT same things to me when I played for the first time, I FEEL YOUR PAIN!
5:17 i hate you mark
Name a better trio than them
Wasn't the Hantu the titty ghost? I remember from Distractable.
Heck yeah phasmaphobia update lets go my fav horror gsme
Mark respond to this you WONT
18:50 Mark says Hantu which is ghost in Malay language lol
Mark, why just why DID YOU TELL LIXIAN OR WHATEVER TO JUMPSCARE US
why the hell did i saw omen at the first part of the vid
2:34 oh my god is that Shane Madej
A game I would love seeing them play is aragmi 2! They are not really known but they make a really good ninja game! And aragmi 2 is multiplier!
lixians moon jumpscare scared me more than the games jumpscare
Love this
Mark I hope u see this I love ur videos so much please NEVER quit ur job please
that moon bit actually scared me lol
All you need is to get the hiding spots down and you’ll be a true ghost hunter😎👌🏻😂
They cut out the part where Bob fakes the spooky door in the beginning lmao.
Im curious if the lads are into play some 7 Days to Die again. Many many updates have occured and i think its a decent time to go back into it in a fresh world :D
YES phasmaphobia is back im hyped!!!!!!
24:42 yeah,.. Wasn't that a reference to something?... I can hardly remember.... There was something mark shouldn't do...
Wade just keep grinding those ghost to oblivion until this point
OMG!!! ITS BACK
It looked like Wade snapped his own neck to abandon Mark. 😂🤣
I LOVE THIS GAME!!! Especially when mark plays it
Oh my gosh Mark got so close to wasting all the cards during a hunt then pulling the insta kill card.
11:20  You are on ur own mark  "WHAT WHY?!"
*[Skeleton falls out of locker]* _So THAT'S why you were collecting the bones in the last game_ _Makes sense now_
Rachel is really good at editing,mark should never change his editors.
The way Bob throws the cup to help mark through the round is hilarious 😂😂😂
It’s wug!!
I've missed these sooooooo much!!!!!
Morning mark~
i don't appreciate not getting this notification
12:51 hey look Wade's the new captain America
cool
10 points for Bob's Blink 182 reference
I found it kinda funny that there's a ghost type called "hantu", because in indonesian (and probably some other languages), hantu literally translates to ghost haha
In malay hantu mean Ghost lol
One of my favourite games they have ever played together so glad they picked it up again.
Mark wasting the entire tarot card stack and seeing that high priestess card had me laughing and cringing
I think it's funny that one of the ghost is called "Hantu" cuz quite literally Hantu means Ghost in Malay 😂😂😂 so it's not a type of ghost at all LMAO  The game should change it to pontianak or penanggal if it's want more type of ghost from here
I miss this all of these videos are pretty funny
Finally I can stop rewatching the same videos over and over lmao
Markiplyer:”I’ll get the cams!”     Markiplyer when he gets the cams:”…FNAF!”
Mark risk of rain 2 got a dlc
25:03 What was that reference to?
9:10 Did he seriously pull the hanged man and the high priestess during a hunt?
Mark really pulled the High Priestess and Hanged Man card on their first game. That's real luck right there.
Aeiou

YESSS
I love how you guys make small talk before entering the house, because in reality you all afraid of entering said haunted house…lmao
32:04 I CAN'T BREATHE
The amount of content this game has gotten since I first played is amazing, I love playing this game in vr
Burt
I love it when they get together to play games
Mark: (makes In Space reference) Mark: Bob, do- do you get it? Bob: (silence) Mark: :(
Omg love this series
Time to add it to that Phasmophobia playlist baby 💜
LETS GOOOOOO
That sacrifice was the funniest thing I’ve seen in a long while 11:00
YES MORE PHASMAPHOBIA I IMISSED THIS
Them: The ghost type is a hantu Me, an intellectual: h a n t u   t e t e k
Hey Markiplier! Glad to see you back making gameplay videos! I always love to watch you play videogames.
I was kind of hoping they would of spotted slenderman in the midst of the trees at some point 😅
Lixian turn my elbow into a jumpscare!
More phasmophobia
I missed this
Yes! More!
Took you long enough 😂 been waiting to see marks POV for dayyys
Noticed that someone's name tag is "Bumbum", doesn't know it was intended but "bumbum" is a cute way to say "ass" in Portuguese BR, idk who's Bumbum guy, but I love him just for that
AND SO MANY VIDEOS I CAN BINGE WATCH THAT  YOU UPLOADED THESE PAST 3 DAYS
almost fainted seeing the title i think i watched the old series like 10-20 times
One finger Death Punch
Very cool
Omigod I'm DYING laughing this is amazing. Mark's screams are everything I missed and remembered them to be
I discovered that door jump scare for the first time in vr🙃
You don't know how long I've been waiting for this .It was 100% worth it
Oh my god he drew a high priestess while the hunt was on... negating it to a fool... he could have resurrected Bob!
Probably didnt, but if you did, then thank you for reading my comment from about a week or so ago to revisit phasmophobia since it got lots of updates.
This is my time to mention Conrad Stevenson's Paranormal P.I., it's a ghost hunting game where each level's ghost has a backstory; it's also closer to realistic ghost hunting
OMGF
Wish it was longer! 😞
FINALLY ANOTHER PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEO ITS BEEN SO LONGGGG
Awesome! I need more scary games Markipooh 💙📹📽🎥🎮🕹
Oh Hantu. Funny though, as that is just the direct translation of the word "ghost". It's not a specific malay ghost, just the word.  If the game wants a malay ghost its like "Pontianak", "Kuntilanak", "Hantu Air", "Hantu Pocong", "Penanggalan" or "Jambalang".
MAJORA’S MASK! 😂
much bettee
I did NOT get a notification for this video at ALL.. WTF?
That first ghost had Yurei behavior. Deaf ghost
So glad you're back
Ive been waiting so long for thissssssss
Find slenderman  at the campsite
😂 that whole vid had me dead
Hey Mark! Doubt you'll see this but if you do could you pretty please play more VoidTrain?
7:38 AAAAAHHH IT'S DEMONS. RUN JIM, RUUUN.
I didnt think he was gonna turn the moon into a jumpscare. Scared the bajesus outta me
The bulletin board jumpscares were so underwhelming that they were mildly funny so when Mark asked Lixian for a moon jumpscare it caught me so offgaurd I nearly pissed myself LMAO.
I’ve been waiting for this day for so long, I really wanted to see Mark’s perspective
FINALLY I've been waiting for you guys to do more video games together. I like Distractible but I love the games and also really enjoyed when you guys used to do the podcast on stream.
Love how when a hunt is going on mark just freezes and looks directly at the ghost running towards him. Pro gamer strats right there.
FINALLY A GOOD GAME
I was literally watching his phasmophoboa yesterday wishing he'd play more, so glad he did!
Do internet cafe sim
FINALLY
PHASMOPHOBIA WITH THE BOYS EVERYONE CHEERED
It's been too long.  Please do more of this!  I've missed this game so much...
Mark somehow surviving whist yelling, standing in the open, and having his light on is insane, im so confused not to mention pulling the d e a t h card
Wade sacrificing himself was awesome. I know it’s just a joke but it legit seems really nice
He wasn't gonna let Mark leave him alone so he intercepte the ghost.
YAAYYYY please play more phasmophobia
For some reason in the journal I read Jinn and Jim... and I just 'Onryo, Obake, Phantom... Jim... J-jim? What is he doing here? What happen to Jim!?!"
Nah okay it in VR it’s 100% more immersive and using the tools feels so much better in VR
mark bob and wade !! back to normal posting on mark’s channel <3 been enjoying all the special livestreams and new content + in space of course, but this is certainly refreshing 🍓
Woohoohoohoo..... Let's do this boys.... Yeah....💋💋💋
YES FINALLY!!!
I'm so glad they came back to this series
Yes I was hoping for this and it finally came! 💜 love this series. XD
This episode was very, VERY weird. You know what? I'm here for it!
they should start a youtube channle together
Finally!!! ✊✊✊
i love that they didnt update the silly player model's stiff animations, they are so funny lmao
Day 1 of asking mark to make a fnaf ar:revisited series
8:02 Mark just hiding behind the tripod was just funny to me for some reason. I mean, I know he was going to place a camera there, but the guys just hear the ghost and he decides to get down instantly. I honestly don't know if hiding behind solid objects works now as well.
hey its my favourite game
Christ Wade! He spends a lot of time in that game lmao Also that entire last half of the first house was hilarious and poor Bob tired warning Mark but too little too late
11:09 got me dead 😂😂
anyone else notice that one of the ghosts names on the board was gary manson lol
Oh yay!! More phasmaphobia I absoulutely loved this series I hope yall continue making more episodes <3
Ye letsss goooo!
Hello Markiplier, I Was just Gonna Ask If You Could Make A Teardown Part 2? Since You Haven't Played It For A Long Time
Mark, would you try elden ring again?
Damn you Lixian and the moon jumpscare!!
Mark depp
I've really missed these three playing together
This is one of my favorite series from you guys, glad its back!
Ohhh right they're playing a game in the game and not playing the game itself. I forgot. 😃
It’s been to long 🥹
Thankyou for the serotonin
I’m gonna be honest I’ve been watching the original series like nonstop and then this came out and I’m so happy
This game looks lame!!! Do better! @Markiplier
'Bout DAMN thyme girls and bois.
Mark only  went in for like 3 minutes on the 2nd round smh lol
Need them playing this game back again.  Or just more of them playing games together in general. Phasmophobia, Bigfoot, The Forest, etc.
I have missed the boys sooo much. Thanks for coming back. Now if we can get some more raft vids!
I literally love when they play this game
"That was one of the worst hunts I've ever been on in my life" says Wade, who also majorly sucked the first time he played post-update. 🤣
"Don't Open the Door" Proceeds to open the door.
“mark i think it killed you” as marks body is on the floor
during the hunt only the fool card can be pulled Mark should've waited on pulling more cards after the hunt one of them could've brought back bob
Help… What is the “Howdy Camper! You made it just in time, we have s’mores” - referencing?  I must know now :3
5:17 wow he actually did it
1:54 Wade Jumpscare
I am watching this 9 hours ago in India
Back on this game
Do more of these types of videos
welcome back mark
Next time you got to light the campfire & *_look into the woods_* please
You'd think after all this time they would rework the first person death animation to be more... Scary.
69k likes funny number lol, Yey new video of markiplier playing phasmopobia lez goo
Bruh i just finished the series 2 hours ago and just noticed that mark finally got back to this game
New phasmaphobia!
Yayyyyyy also please do Yandere simulator I wanna see you okay around with allll the new stuff :)
I'm sad he didnt get the UV light on the equipment shelf
I like how the devs using foreign terms for different type of ghosts in this game, but I can't stop laughing since in my country "hantu" is literally just plain ol' generic term for ghosts 😂
Bruh😂I still got jump scared even when mark literally said make it a jump scare 🤣
I really missed these videos
LOVE when yall play phasmo!
The fact that hantu is just means ghost in malay just bruhh
wow new episode of Distractible
Fun fact:in  30:27 theres a refence to jason a horror movie
My friend and I didn’t know the music box would cause a hunt immediately when brought by the ghost, we just kind of figured something would happen if we put the two together so I threw it in the ghost room and my friend died
Wade: Hey when the ghost is hunting try not to make too much noise ok? Mark: freaks out
Not me screaming at 1:08 😱😭
Love the Friday the 13th reference
Hey Mark! I'm not sure if you take requests or not but could you maybe try Hollow Knight?
U guys are the sly cooper team of this gen
Play that other Phasmaphobia game, I think it’s called Ghost Hunters Corp. more funny and scary!! Also play the Mimic!
Bob died drawing one card, Mark survives drawing cards like he’s in Yu-Gi-Oh       Guys, Yu-Gi-Oh’s Author, Kazuki Takahashi have passed away on July 6,2022. May he Rest In Peace and maybe even duel God in heaven
5:15 - *Majora has come back for haunt me again..*
Still waiting for this game to release on Xbox ill be having loads off fun
I just want to know when this is getting a question 2 standalone version...
Yo shoutout to Lixian for giving me warning for the jump scare that was clutch and saved my eardrums
YES! Now is there a twitch stream of this?
just got done watching bob & wade's povs and came back to see this!! i love watching these three lmao
so Markiplier is a asshole from his wisdom teeth video
This is “phasmophobia with markiplier”
I may be uncultured but what was the camp reference?
Wake up, babe, mark bob and wade posted.
LETS GO PHASMOPHOBIA WITH MARK, BOB AND WADE IS BACKKKKKKKK
I know it's because he got possessed, but I just like to imagine Wade got so frightened that he just snapped his own neck to get out of there. "You're on your own now, Mark."
Mark: John Madden! John Madden! John Madden! Me: Football!
I love watching the guys.....................   i mean, play games together .................... Like , computer games and stuff... 😶 Never mind 😑
I really want to play this game. It's so cool! Also, the guys are hilarious. I love when they play games together.
More of this please!
I'm no expert but I get a hunch that Wade really doesn't like this game
Was the "howdy campers" thing at 25:00 an Unus Annus reference?
Oooooh! I've missed you guys playing phasmo! so glad to see it back!!
Bob: WHere are u? Me: And I'm so sorry! XD
Now that they are playing games together again, I wonder if Wade still has their Raft save file intact?
bob: *sees fire* bob: it seems to run on some form of electricity
THANK GOD UR PLAYING THIS GAME AGAIN MARK
I love how the game called mark out with the fool card
Praise be!
How to get lots of likes and get pinned ?
i missed this.
Please more Phasmophobia
The way he just junps in and says no me! And dies for mark is absolutley hilarious
I love when they play this game
ngl there was something low key horrifying about bob telling Mark fromthe beyond that the ghost was hunting him with a meat cleaver, immediately after mark realized the gate was locked. xD
Yo I'm so done. Yall make me think of my bestie and I. We are so quick to make sexual references to each other or do something completely dumb which gets us killed. XD same with my husband too though!
My phone had broken recently. I don't have much in life. Had a really emotional day. And this made me feel better. Such a little thing.  Made my day
Famous last words : "ok , so this ghost is a little aggressive."
Been a while since Phasmophobia; it’s only gotten spookier and funnier.  Also isn’t it ironic the two higher levelled friends keep dying first? 😂
Majoras mask moon was the scariest thing, it activated my PTSD
Aeiou
the hantu tatek got bob........ the prophecy was true.......
ok but like WHY did i not get a notification for this :((
ah yes more phasmo content letsgoo
11:00 Wade is being hero right now
FUCK YEAH missed this game so much keep watching the playlist of the other videos 🤣🤣
I love your videos with bob and wade!! Keep it up!!!
I was waiting for this to come out
The boys are back at Phasmophobia again!
YAY
The throwing of the cup when he was gonna be killed and "YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN MARK" had me absolutely rolling. I haven't laughed that hard in a while
Who else missed this series?
... the scariest jumpscare to ever jumpscare, the Majora's Moon... by the way, Lixian isn't popping in like he normally does, he good?
hello there
As a pro Phas player, seeing mark not only drawing cards during the hunt, but drawing a High Priestess kinda killed me inside
Yesssss love the phasmophobia vids
At 23:55 I heard Lady Pleaser
Is THIS REAL RN ? IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO PLAY THIS AGAIN FOR SO LONG
when it hunted and he spammed the cards he got the heigh prectice and it didn't count because it was hunting 😂
Yes! I was hoping for more of this!
I love you guys. Please keep on making videos together
Can we just talk about how wade was just yelling at the end at Mark
can you revisit five nights at fuckboys
Me seeing Wade's level: "how in the fuck?"
Love when Mark wakes Bob and wade from the cryo freezer for a new video
Ghost starts approaching,  Mark: *Has light on, and is standing in the middle of the room*
i waited years for this 👹
im sooo glad they played this game more! part of me wishes they knew more about it, but part of me likes the ignorant blunders lol
Anyone know what the reference was mark made at 25:02?
Okay, so...all jokes aside: I actually experienced a ghostly whisper before,  in real life. I experienced it twice! Once at night on my way to refill water bottles at the water mill, and then the second time over a year later as I was driving to a doctor's appointment downtown.  Yep: the spirit realm is real. Spooky. 👻
Bob just proved gacha games are indeed harmful to you.
One of the greatest intros to a youtube video that ive ever seen
I missed this game soo much
I want more than one episode of distractible a week. Also Wade's Secret Words is the best episode to date
Every time they say cursed objects I think of Jujutsu Kaisen.
I forgot how scary this game is. I’m gonna try again in the morning. Good night, everybody!
But hantu is ghost in Malay...
Welcome back 😅 been waiting
Did any one notice how the maple lodge campsite map looks like golden freddy's face from fnaf2 25:09
It always seems like Bob gets lost so easily in this game
wait, I always called the skeleton steve, is that actually his name?
The chase continues
No Way I just-- Just Watched The One In 2020
watched this same footage 3× on wade, bob, and mark's channels and laughed everytime.........sucker for the distractible boys ngl
You should do more it was such a good series
Watching you play Phasmophobia with Bob and Wade is definitely my Favorite series you guys play together!!! Please do more 🙏😍❤
I love when these 3 are together
Finally... he returns.
The moment i saw the title, I know right away, I'm gonna have tons of fun with this video.
The ghost in the lobby is Charles, yes a chad
WHY DID I NOT GET THIS NOTIFICATION- YouTube argh
does anyone know what the camping reference was to?
Such a good game
They need play Monnbase Alpha. JOHN MADDENNNNNNN!
Mark has done everything he could to keep himself from quoting space this whole time and now that it's out he's gonna do it with every upload
This game died way too quick, we need bring it back into the mainstream
YAY new update to the phasmophobia! Not me going back and binging the other videos
Please play with Ethan!! :D
Loved the video please make more phasmophobia!
Ye finally!!❤️😎😃 a new Phasmo video!
PROXIMITY VOICE!!!
I regret having my volume so high
It’s been so long, I love seeing you guys play this game❤️
Thank the lords this is back
1:55 he doesn't need too you already made the sounds even doe it's not jumpscare sound but it still funny
As soon as I saw this I was so ready to watch it! Kept rewatching these because they're so good
I still cant get over the slurping noise the walkie talkies make
Bro for ur next vid u should sing NO NO DONT TOUCH ME THERE THIS IS MY NO NO SQUARE
Can you make more peopleplaygrond
One of the best vids I've seen faw
I have been waiting for this for so LONG!!!!!! YESSSSSS
IM EARLY BUT KOT REALLY BUT KINDA :D
I need more distractable trio phasmo in my life now.
I was hoping for poppy playtime but this is just as good
can we have more with jacksepticeye tho??
So happy your continuing this series Mark. This games content along with the intense and hilarious moments that are made shows so much potential Phasmophobia has to be a bigger series on your channel. Looking forward to more videos on this amazing game in the future.
33:24 Bob: "Mark did you get my messages from beyond?" I was so hoping that would be followed up with: "I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty"
Boop
had did mark survive the card hunt...
Alas, poor Wade’s sacrifice was in vain
It’s hilarious how Bob became a coffee cup on the lookout for Mark and Wade
Pretty cheeky of the developers to include a suspended Blair Witch stick figure AND a Jason Vorhees Mask floating on the lake, on the same map, no less.
You guys should play this more often
Mark really needs to shut the fuck up when it starts hunting. He hears the static and he yells “THE GHOST IS THERE I THINK I SEE IT”
oh hi mark, bob and wade
Thanks!
i need moreee and i want moreee of phasmophobia
Another Good Video From my  Fav Youtuber Markiplier
It's super cool seeing each one's video so can see their faces and how much they edit.
im glad you havent quit youtube broski
20:00 boys. 🙄😂🤣
Imagine the shoulder rub bit if they were playing in vr
Mark: Oh hey guys.
I hope they play more of this game again, I love when they play scary games together :)
I know what happened to Bob, the hee hoo got him
That door jumpscare at the start sold me. Y'all need to play this more 🤣
how weird is it that I've been rewatching this Markiplier that was released almost 2 years ago and he suddenly released another Phasmopobia video!
All this talk of a van, in the beginning, makes me miss The Barrel! 😭
hantu literally just means ghost. its the most generic broad term, why did they choose that name
Hey Mark! Ib remake released its english version, hope you'll play it someday
When Wade was trying to get Mark to go to that door, I was screaming 'do it! DO IT!' like that dead Labouf meme. Another funny thing about that door, I was in a lobby with some Americans, one guy let his little brother have control and the headset and tried to get him to walk to the door. He was like 'it's not a jumpscare is it?' And we were all like 'Nah, it's okay.' After he walked to the door and a bit of silence the last thing we heard from the kid was 'I hate yooou!' I felt a little bad but damn that was funny.
Im so happy they came back to this maybe they will do bigfoot
*explains the cursed mirror item and how it drains sanity* "Hey mark pick this up would you?" "Yeah sure" *is immediately hunted*
I was literally watching the older videos of this yesterday wow
FINALLY
Where's Jack?
more phasmaphobia
YUEEESSSSS!!!! More Phasmo!!!
As someone who knows how the game works, this is both hilarious and painful
bob and wade completely ignoring the camping with markiplier reference made me feel so bad for mark lol
WHY WAS BOB AND WADE AND MARK ALL STARING AT EACH OTHER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HUNT WITHOUT TALKING SO FUCKING FUNNY
You have smashed a keyboard with your face before.
Mark, you’re hilarious and your videos are amazing, but you are absolutely terrible at this game… I love it!
PLEASE play more of this it’s so entertaining
Happy to finally see some more Phasmophobia content after 2 years 👉🌟
I need to see more of these from you guys!  It's so damn funny!
The ghost hunter returns!
The coffee cup of death oh my GOD
Try prison and others large area.
Lixian, please do a jumpscare BEFORE mark says "Lixian do a Jumpscare!".
Dam almost 1 million views in only 6 hours. Can’t wait to see what it’s at in a day
when he kept pulling cards during the hunt and got high priestess I died a little inside T___T whyyyyyy
Please more of this game
25:48 aieou
25:00 Am I am idiot? What is that a reference to?
Glad to see this again it cracks me up every time 😂
I’m so glad they came back to phasmophobia! Marks original series was some of my favourite videos from him
Try ghost exiles
I love marks videos, their so funny and make my day better
AHHHHH I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS! Literally my favorite game, and I love watching these guys play
I lose it when mark ran to the door with the mirror “open the doooor!” 😂
Dude finally 🙌 been waiting for this forever
Oooh, this is going to be fun to watch, also, its not just the voice chat that gets you killed, if you keep any electronics powered on at your hand (flashlight or videocamera for example) while the hunt is on, the ghost will find you even if you were inside a closet or in a hiding spot.
FUCK YES I LOVE THIS GAME 🤩
nothing scared me more than Bob popping out of the truck at 19:11 for some reason
More
i really cant stop fucking laughing everytime the character models ben down and look up or look down. they look goofy asf
The guys are back! what an amazing intro Mark 😍.
YESS I've been waiting for Mark to play this game again haha. So glad he's back!
God I missed these! lol
Why is it always more funny than scary
Showed my dad this, he loves it. Also its 1122 est time, aka almost midnight, my light is off and I'm high as shit eating fruitsnacks
Missed this game so much 😂
When marks uploads an actual video after after 5 weeks and it's got his annoying friends in it 🙄 😒
YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Been waiting for this LETS GO
Was chakras confirmed a Kanye reference…..
I love how bobs dead when they open the door😂
MARK PLAY ONE NIGHT AT FLUMPTYS 3
This series of Phasmophobia gets better and better
Gotta love running around with a night vision camera, with your flashlight on and the night vision (ghost orb detecting) filter off.
When you light the campfire you can see slenderman in the woods outside the map
Is a pocong already in this game?
John Mark Dougan, Gonzalo Lira, Ritter Scott and Patrick Lancaster, Anne-Lauren Bonnel, Alexander Mercouris, Alina Lipp, Eva k Barlett cool! 💗.
OmG jOjO rEfErEnCe!
Mark wasted a high priestess. Damn
MORE
Omg! At 30:26 there was a Friday The 13th reference!!!! Jason Voorhees mask was in the water!😂😂
There’s a rib cage on the table here, Mark?  I’ve never seen that before! It’s not mine! I was holding it for a friend!
YES PHASMAPHOBIAS BACK    this has been one of my favorite series mark and the others have done and I cant tell you how excited I am about this*
So sad that Bob didn't recognize the quote from in camp with Markiplier
YES THE GANG IS BACK TOGETHER
Idk if he saw my comment about playing it again or he just decided to play Mark if you see this I'm a huge fan I almost watched all your vids
24:37 what is he referencing?
I dont know if any one has mentioned this but you can pick up a uv flashlight now in the waiting lobby and see hidden secrets
I like it when Mark wears his glasses. It's adorable imho
MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE
I love it when Bob goes silent to make the others think he died, he's done it twice now 🤣
THEY ARE BACK! WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
looks like Saul Goodman to me
I connected YouTube to my Chromecast and tried to fast forward to where I was originally. Mark and lixian gave me a heart attack bc the first thing i saw at full volume in a pitch black room was the moon jumpscare
Mark: "OH I'M ABOUT TO DIE"  Also mark: *continues to stand in the exact same spot and stare at the hallway*
I was watching their old Phasmo streams earlier today wondering when they’d play the new updates… holy crap the timing
yeYESSSS IVE LOVED THE PHASMOPHOBIA SERIES!!! IM SO HAPPY YOURE GETTING BACK TO IT!!!
They died in the same order
I’ve waited so long……
would be more fun in VR mode
Play more pls
Please turn this game into a long lasting series!
yo i swear to god on my life ive been watching the old episodes yesterday and today
I laughed so hard at how Mark was the last one to die even tho he was doing the most sh!t
Wade: I think eyeballs up there are new Mark: eyeballs? What are you talking about? Wade: they’re are not new for me I think they’re are new for you
Hey Mark, remember in 3 Scary Games, you played a game called Janitor Bleeds?  The full game is out, and I was wondering if you planned to play it?  It's a really good game.  Anyone think Mark should play it?
play it with jackkkk💗
Why didn't you all leave the house after the first hunt to get meds to help your sanity. 😭 I'm so surprised you survived that long... Also I think the mirror triggered the haunt because his sanity was low. 😩
You know after 2 months it’s nice to be seeing mark bob and wade back to their antics.
11:04 when Mark is scared af coz everything flickers and then Wade comes at the time everything goes back to normal like saying "see, nothing to be afraid of" but he twists his neck after is the real horror movie experience
i was just binging this series
FINALLY!!!
Dude I’m so glad there series is come I h back! It’s one of my favorites!
Truly beautiful work on that intro!
Bob and Wade episodes are the best
It's about damn time I've been waiting for a while for another plasmaphobia video
OMG I have been dying for more phasmophobia
Cant believe you're back in this game
I don't like where the developer seems to be going with this game.  They keep making the ghost deadlier and deadlier without giving the dead players something to do.  By deadlier and deadlier the ghost rarely seems to manifest without hunting.  On top of this the ghost and move rooms.  So you can spend half a round finding the room and setting up equipment only for the ghost to change rooms.  The whole time your sanity is reducing and can only bring so many pills.  A game the feels like should have lots of spooks and few hunts turns into almost all hunts.
Fun fact: Cursed items lower your sanity. Increasing the chance to hunt. Also unless you have a good hiding spot. Do not tell the board. "Lets play hide and seek"
hearing john madden and aeiou aeiou unlocked a memory inside of me thank you mark
Can you get Jack/Sean to play with you again?
Mark should've livestreamed this. I think livestreaming Phasmophobia is a lot better than edited Phasmo.
YES PHASMOPHOBIA I MISSED THESE
Years, YEARS I’ve been watching you three, and bob is miles away the funniest person f*king EVER
Hantu in Indonesia means Ghost (Possibly is Malaysia too)
Hantu in Indonesia means Ghost
These are the best, I love it, keep it coming please? We love you!!
Very explosive intro  Insta subscribed
I'm so glad this game isn't just another game that gets popular on youtube until kids find it and start playing it and then becomes "cringe" (like fortnite and among us) because I genuinely enjoy watching and playing this game so much.
Thank you for seeing my comment in the live Stream
“That’s uh Steve👍”
Bro literally yesterday I was rewatching old PHASMOPHOBIA videos w my bestfriend and  I was like bro I wish he made a new video. Then this. MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS
That moon jumps are actually got me
Loved watching the guys play the updated Phasmo! It was an awesome way to end the day after caring for my toddler! Sit on the couch, eat Cadbury chocolates and watch them freak out.
Mark: Lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare Me: Make it Majora's Mask Moon Lixian: I gotchu
THEY HAVE RETURNED
“It’s not showering, it’s just on” -Markiplier 2022
"I have been playing horror games for 10 years and you think a little steam will scare me"
1:08 this is just my mom sneezing. I stg I jump every time
Markiplier's content is always fun, but once again, Lixian's magical touch turns a few friends playing games into A Cinematic Work of Art. Huzzah for these dudes working together
WOOOOOOO!!! MORE PHASMOPHOBIA WITH MARK AND THE GANG!!! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!
Poobis
I just watched the whole series
"The ghost can hear you if you talk when it's hunting." Mark: *Proceeds to yell at the top of his lungs every hunt*
The camp and mask was literally a reference of the Friday the 13th movie. Which is nice.
Love when they play this game
**holds trumpet to mouth** “AAAAAAHHH!!!”
Hey mark did you know if you look around that stick sign at the campsite you can see slenderman
I haven’t even watched the video yet- but I’m so excited omg omg omg
5:16 scared the shit outta me
only this game can manage to make a coffee cup hopping towards someone scary
I didn't get a notification for this video...
First game with carot cards... high prestires or how how u spell it and hanged man
MORE.  GIVE ME MORE, MARK. This is the content I CRAVE.
Seeing the boys back to together after playing a game they last played almost 2-3 years ago makes me happy
The noise I made when I saw mark had posted a new phasmophobia video was like the sound the ghost made when it screamed at Bob the first map..
Hey he is back!
I wish Jack was in a video of this, just like the first vid or two.
One Night At Flumpty's 3 Would Be Kinda Cool Since He Loved The Other Two
I am so happy this series is back
You know, every dnd player knows, it's not a good idea to draw from The Deck of Many things.
Mark I really appreciated that In Space With Markiplier reference. It made my day :)
Yeah phasmo is back but I think y’all did good
You can put the camera on the tripod before you leave the van and then pick it up, then you can carry something else as well
Work 100%
I'm going to basic training In a few weeks thank you so much big fan for years since I was 12 or 13 I believe first thing I ever seen from you was slenderman and subnotica. I've loved watching you grow and will continue to watch everything and have a major catch up after basic stay strong love ya.
At last, I've seen Wade and Bob's playthroughs and this is just as hilarious as I hoped it would be
How yhe fuck did mark pull the death card snd not die im do confused LOLLL
Beautiful intro job lixian 😂💞
That went well… 🤣
No a update why the game is already scary
the cup of death falling in front of mark as he dies is the probably the best thing bob could've done in that situation
Woooooo the trio is back with more phasmaphobia
I've been waiting SO LONG for another Phasmophobia video. Can't belive you actually uploaded one!!! This is one of my fav horror games, cus it's soo fun!  I've rewatched all the previous videos soo many times. I sure will rewatch this one a couple of times too :)
YEEEEESS!!! I’ve been missing these. 😭
18:49 i just like they put hantu in there... its basically malay mean of ghost..
its funny lmao cus my friend didn't trust me either when i told her too look out that door in the lobby 😂🤦🏾‍♂
I laughed out loud so many times. This was a good one.
YES I LOVE THIS SERIES PLEASE BRING IT BACK
You should get Insym to play he is one of the best phasmophobia players
Woooooooo!!!!
LETS GOOO
I love them playing phasmo It's hilarious! Lol
i missed phasmaphobia
I’m so glad you returned to this game and saw how much the game changed! It’s one of my all time favorites and the devs are super awesome! I Hope you’ll stick around for the future updates that’ll be coming this year!
he kept pulling the fool but kept TALKING WHILE THE GHOST WAS HUNTING. mark really lived up to it
Watching mark pull the high priestess during a hunt hurt my soul
CAN YOU DO BIGFOOT REVISITED PLZ WITH BOB AND WAD
i hate you because you look better than me.
lmao i cant even. I completely changed my opinion of Wayde after this video. It's been a while since i last watched the group play something, and last time he was still relatively new. He DEFINITELY got this attitude/timing down now.   this episode, he made me laugh so much. I feel he really found his confidence and i swear. subscribing now. its nice to watch him develop in his streaming persona. Good job wayde, your work has not gone unnoticed
I am ashamed to declare I may have jumped at that moon jumpscare
FINALLY MY FAVORITE SERIES RETURNS
There's a uv light on the shelves next to the white board that shows a lot of hidden messages in the main lobby
I LOVE Mark’s Phasmophobia series!! The witty banter between all of them is HILARIOUS and I am here for it!!
The John Madden bit was such an excellent reference! I love that video so much.
“Is that the Death cup or the Go There cup?!”
* flash backs to BONE BROTH *
17:54 that's freezing temps mark
Fun fact… the death card has never meant literal death… like at all
Forg
Yo bro can we have another video for phas, Love the game btw
The ghost just wondering why a bunch of guys just came in talking about god knows what
"The ghost can hear you when it's hunting" Mark: **literally says every single word in the Oxford, Scrabble, and Urban dictionary**
i love phasmo please keep on posting
I haven't watched this yet but I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THE TITLE. I AM SO EXCITED.
I really hope this is something we will all start to see more of
The way that pulling the cards over and over reading them off like "Bad news" and surviving is supreme.
More chivalry please : >
I'd love for these guys to play with Insym or Psycho lol
The character growth of Wade just saying, “no” and playing professional anyways..
Can't wait for more of this chaos, and we haven't even seen some of the more crazy ghosts!
This was a long time ago cause Mark kept getting "the fool" everytime he drawed a card which was an old bug.
8:20 "I'VE GOT BAD NEWS!!"
"If its a go there cup to my death I'm gunna be very mad" xD bruh I CANNOT rn
Back to hunting ghosts with the squad! I missed this. But my goodness Mark being scared of all the updates is relatable. That closet spirit always gets me lol
Yes!
I play Phasmophobia and the high priestess could've brought Bob back go life 😭😂 when they freak out over the small sounds I laugh cause I'm used to it now, I'm kind of really good at the game lmao, the sound effects added are hilarious, I've been wanting them to play again for so long. So fo4 the cursed mirror, the longer you use it, the lower your sanity will be, but if your sanity is already low, it will break faster, same with the oujia board, it will break if you have too low of sanity while using it, so only ask a few questions, and all I know about the voodoo doll is that when the pin goes through the heart, it hunts, you can survive the tarot cards if you hide, high priestess brings someone back to life, music box attracts the ghosts to you and will start hunting, and the summoning circle, you should light the last candle closest to the door, you can smudge, have someone get a picture, and then run.
that was a onryo i saw it but dang that was very cool
"It's a cougar" -Wade 2022
After watching Insym, this gave me anxiety lmao.
The coffee cup was a paid actor
I love them playing phasmophobia
Please collab with Insym PLEASE MARK 🙏
Please consider playing Granny 3 Mark!  I love Phasmophobia, thanks!
These three should play the second first game when it comes out
I highly recommend Mark to play with REAL Ghost detectives🔎        How cool would that be? 👻
Parecia o Ric Fazeres na capa
Look who came crawling back.
I’ve waiting so long for more phasmophobia broooo
Please make another series of this
THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THIS AGAIN! :D
DO SO MANY MORE OF THESE VIDEOS I LOVE THE ENTIRE SERIES AND I WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER OF YOU, BOB, AND WADE PLAYING THIS OVER AND OVER. THANK YOU, AND PLEASE DO MORE I'VE ASKED YOU ON EVERY SINGLE VIDEO PLEASE
Mark pulled the high priestess (revival) and the hanged man (instant death) and they didn’t work because of the fool card (which has a 16% chance of happening anyways when it’s not a hunt) lmfao
OMG It'S H2o DeIrias!!!!!!!
I love how your growing your hair out again!
Just finished watching an Insym video and I see this in the recommendations. ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ  Edit: bruh Mark could've brought Bob back with the high priestess if he wasn't pulling cards during the hunt lol
MORE PHASMOPHOBIA. Itʻs great lol. Also SHEESH, that intro was BOOM BOOM BOOMTASTIC!
BOOM PHASMOPHOBIA POW ok
Lixian and Mark are the perfect pair!
16:46 - I love the boop confirmation for motion detector or was it when something crossed off the list.  There's a six finger handprint ghost now!
YESSSSSS!!!!!!
This game is so good, the trio makes it even better
Don't worry mark i'll do your intro... Hello everybody welcome back to Phasmophobia
Pogo stuck 3
Hantu just means ghost in Malay
LETS GOO IM SO EXCITED ITS BEEN SOOOOOOO LONG
Yay
What part of “if you talk the ghost will know where you are” does mark not understand?🤦‍♀️😂
“Fun” Fact:  The last photo on the board is from the “Amityville Horror” house. The ghost pictured is believed to be that of 9 year old John DeFeo. One of the all six family members murdered by Ronald DeFeo.
If you think Wade’s level is ridiculous, a YouTuber/Streamer named Insym is at like lvl 8,000
I actually jumped OUT of my chair at 5:19
On vrchat I found a world dedicated to unnus annus (idk if I spelled that right) and it was really cool due to it having remixes and funny quotes from the series. Just remember we love you and we loved the interaction between you and Ethan. We hope you do something like that again
You should make more video with Bob and Wade. For me they are instant watches.
yesss a new phasmophobia video! I just finished watching the old series yesterday and now there's a new one. Coincidence? I think NOT!
I enjoy watching Mark's videos. Also for phasmophobia, you can put the camera on the tripod and then pick up the tripod with the camera.
Should stream this with them!!!!!!
Shocked they not know the ghost detects equipment too. Don't blame em since they not play it in so long.
YAAAAAAAS!!!!! Aw man Ive missed this game!!!
Fun fact: the cursed item was tarot cards, the same were used in part 3 of jojos bizarre adventure
I kid you not I was just watching marks Phasmophobia videos NOT 2 HOURS BEFORE THIS UPLOADED
omg i missed the phasmaphobia playthroughs
27:49  john madden john madden john madden john madden AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU uuuuuuuu 99999
I just happened to play Phasmophobia before this video was realesed
"You're on your own Mark" Goodness I haven't laughed this hard for a while
Having lights or electronics on actually attracts the ghost to you when it's hunting! Turn them off when it hunts!
Didn’t he draw the hanged man in the first location?? How did he not die?
Mark: Death? Draws a card and got Death 🤣
HOLY
Another series of this game please 😁
Theres a dude named "Insym" yall should play this with if you want someone with experience. Makes Wade look new.
I played this for the first time in a while with some friends lately, glad to see they' revisted it as well because there is SO much new stuff! Also I definitely played that door prank on my friends too haha
*MMMMAAAAAAAARRRRK!!* there is a UV flashlight on one of the shelves to the right of the white board (the one "furthest" away) if you use it in there lobby there are a bunch of UV hidden messages written all over the place. including some higher-up places.
trio minecraft series
omg i was so not expecting this, but it was a wonderful surprise!!
17:12-18:30 and 19:49-20:34   Me: Screw finding ghost, these guys should be getting paid to make pornos 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It took me a moment to realize the thumbnail is a woman hung upside-down.  At first, I thought it was someone riding a demonic donkey
So, I'm not sure if you have found this out or not but the cards will always draw a fool while the ghost is hunting, the fool basically means the card doesn't do anything.
Yes finally I love these series so much
"where are youuu and I'm so sorry"
Yaay you're playing Phasma Again
Im literally shaking and crying rn
I guess a game only has "SO MANY UPDATES" if you don't play your games
This is great, we need more bob and wade
IT HAS RETURNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bro i honestly never ever thought they'd come back phasmophobia but im literally so psyched that they did omg
23:06 "bob fight it!" *BWAH*
5:15 anyone else's soul leave their body?
22:14
The intro is perfect 1 thousand hours into those realistic explosions and the text
Can you make another phasmophobia video with Jack, Bob, and Wade
Where is Jack at
Hanged man and high pritstest in one game
Iiiittssss baaaaaaacckkkkk!
Mark! Would you please f-g hide?!!!
I missed this content so much! Good to see you back at it man!!!
YAY!!!!!!!!!
Who else misses tiny box Tim
the tower card is a representation of the tower of Babel. Those who know their bible stories know that god absolutely destroyed the tower because he had a lil hissy fit about humanity working together to get to heaven. Mostly working together and the story explains why we speak different languages... but mainly that card represents destruction.
finally omg ive been waiting for another phasmo for so long
Attempt no 6  MARK! a game needs your HELP.  There is a space exploration game called  'elite dangerous core ' this game has our very own galaxy for it's map. Stars abound,planets,black holes,nebulas, neutron stars the list goes on.   This game gives you many different ships to do a load of different things in there massive map. From being able to mine, explore or combat earning millions and billions.  But this game has been left to slowly rot away.its dieing mark slowly.. but perhaps with your influence and love of space you could save elite and indulge in your space fareing ways. And show your viewers the wonders of elite dangerous core.
Bob: where are yooouuu Me: AND IM SO SORRYYY~ I CANNOT SLEEP, I CANNOT DREAM TONIGHT!!! 😭😭😭😭
just a guess but i thiiiii8jk wade might like phasmo a little bit xD
My favorite series
Mark you gotta revisit Labyrinth
I so hope this means the boys will get back into raft once chapter 3 drops
YES THIS IS WHAT I WANTED YES
GG!! LOVE IT MARK LOOKING FORWARD FOR MORE HEHE
1:33 When you never come out of the closet. v_v;
I love their friend dynamic lmao
Who else watched this on Bob and Wade's channels and now came here for Mark? 🤣
It’s heckin’ WIMDY *insert fox thinkin’ its heckin’ WIMDY*
I CANT EXPRESS HOW AMAZING IT IS THAT THE BOYS ARE PLAYING THIS AGAIN!!!
I see Mark has mastered the long-forgotten art of *standing still to death*
Would love see Jackseptieceye return playing this game with gang again
.
I hope Jack plays this game again
Oh I hope there are more installments coming out in the next few days. Definitely one of my fav horror series after the Forest 🖤
Shaking n crying rn
THEYRE BACK!! I was so hoping you guys would play again with all that’s changed. It’s actually challenging now too lmao. Can’t just outrun the ghost anymore (unless it’s a hantu haha) Edit: Bob stands in the corner in the open “MARK WHY YOU TALK”.. I love you guys and I know you’re “new” but it pains me the way you play… lmao
Sea of thieves
W vid
mark doesn't die in this one as much
we need a jackaboy
I love watching you guys play this! Please do more!
Yes it’s back
I hope they play sons of the forest when it’s out, these guys are my favorite gaming trio ever
Oh oh man.. I got so excited for a second because I seen brown jacket guy and thought of LUUUKKEEE 😭😭😭 omg I’d absolutely love to see you play with Ken and Luke… Mark please play with Ken and Luke, the hilarity will give me so much dopamine. Unlike this.. damnit Bob for ruining my dreams. (Jk Bob ily)
I love how like just none of them know how tarot cards work
Nice intro xD
Is it just me or just me😆 does mark be came more chubby? Cheeks
10:56 I need to know the music lol
why is wade's voice different? or is it an upgraded mic?
You guys should play Ghost Exile!! Its like phasmo but at some point you get to actually banish the ghosts
You guys should look around with the UV in the garage.
"You're on your own now Mark" "Hehe wait what do you me- OH MY GOD"
Hi                                        Bye
Yes!!!!! I'm so glad this game is back!
Favorite series! Seriously my wife and I watch their phasmophobia play through once a month. So glad they revisited it!!!
just the tone in Mark's voice when Bob didn't understand the ISWM reference
Yay!!!
Mark drawing the card of death, screaming, and standing in the open undying whilst everyone around him dies is one of the greatest examples of plot armor I have ever seen.
This game is boring, it's beyond me how this got so popular
Dude when Mark's headphones almost fell off I got flashbacks of when bob's headphones fell off his head when they were playing Gmod fnaf
Moreeee
mark 20:00 where can i find them picture at
I missed this.
I love this series
Mark: visible concern his friend didn't watch his choose-your-own-adventure. Me: CUT THE YELLOW WIRE!
I've been waiting for a new Mark or Jack Phasmophobia video for so long
More more more
Lmfao to Wade’s death sequence 😂
As Wade realized the inevitability of the approaching eldritch horror, he proceeded to escape this existence by snapping his own neck and leave his friend behind lol
I missed phasmophobia 🥺 So glad y'all played it again :D
This never tends to fail to be absolutely hilarious.
Does anyone else see the irony in the first ghost they get being a hantu?
I just rewatched your entire series of this the other day.  I’ve wanted more for so long.  Please keep this going.
Bob the helpful ghost :D
All we are missing is Sean now.
I been waiting for another phasmaphobia Viejo for ages
The John Madden reference made me laugh so hard 😂
Please make this into a returning series!
Bruh. Please cut out mark telling you to put in jumpscares so it actually jumpscares viewers. Otherwise what's the point of the jumpscare?
I will never get tired of phasmophobia
8:20 Mark is literally the guy who gets the deck of many things and draws every card
Watching Bobs pov then Marks is amazing 🤣
🙂
It’s been a minute
I beg of you, please do more phasmophobia, this was so funny and chaotic
my fav trio
I have been waiting for another phasmophoia video. These are definitely my videos that I watch from Mark, love you markkk🫶🏽
29:57; did anyone else notice the soccer ball moving towards mark without anyone touching it?
HANTUTETEC
Mark. you are late on being told this but powerwash sim. It has multiplayer
i love phasmophobia thank you
I like the space with mark
it fucken WIMDY
2:20 Filming space DUH
Mark should play this a bit more often if he wants to be anywhere close to Bob or Wades levels! Especially Wade’s level!
THINK FAST CHUCKLENUTS
Hello Mark, I was just thinking that you are about 1 year and a half behind on little nightmares 2. Now I know you went through trauma on the first on because of the 30 minutes of credits but I would like to ask that you make an exception. And also their was a part 2 on the first one so if you want you could check that out. Thank you for the time and like if you want little nightmares 2 for mark
man i cant figure out what they were referencing 24:37
wiener?
I know it'll end one day But I really enjoy the sheer chaos and ambiance of GTFO and Phasmophobia episodes
Hey mark you should dance in one of your vids to dis song feat;in my mind crystal waters
YEEESSS
i forgot mark is a YouTuber
*arriving at the campsite*  AAAAAHHHHH!!!!! It’s time for the scout’s oath!
What about all the ghost writing on the truck that can only be seen with the uv?
Will there be a one night at flumpty’s 3 video any time soon?
Mark I love when I see you play with bob and wade and I’ve been waiting for you to play this once again
I like how at the end of the video mark reacts to the music
“Speaking of skeletons in the closet” woooo bonk
Happy one year of Distractible!
I watched Bob’s view on this first and I’ve been waiting so long to see what cards Mark drew lmfao I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time
Always love the content with Bob and Wade
Anyone else think Mark should try playing "it steals?"
Mark Wade and Bob making smut videos in the middle of a ghost hunt is the kind of content I didn't know I needed
Finally, after like 2 years, he returned to it.
wade mustve started speed running levels
I love Phas keep playing please!
Was just thinking about this game again!
Anyone else think Mark's looking a little chubby? 🤔
Yes!!! We need more!
Wade chargers fan?
IM EARLY-ISH also the intro ok
all of the buget was used for the start of the video lol
FINALLY YES please do more phasmophobia
reference to space with markiplier love it!
I’ve been waiting sooooo long for y’all to play this game again it was so hilarious and amazing please do more
15:27 i almost die of laughter
No one can feel me how happy I was when I first saw this!!!! I loved the old phasmophobia episodes and I’m so glad there new stuff!
30:30 loved the Jason Vorhees Easter egg
good to know mark met terry the ceiling man and lisa the spooky door lady <3
You should play with Insym...
Oh no
Woooo! Love to see another phasmophbia video! Hope to see more!
Make more 3 scary games
✨JUMPSCARE SOUND EFFECTS BY LIXIAN SUPREMACY✨
I'm surprised that Mark didn't die when he got a DEATH CARD and survived the hunts 😂
I love how they call the UV flashlights the “semen” lights due to that one scene from that gordon Ramsay tv show
I love this game. Seeing these three goofs playing it makes my heart happy :)
The 3 musketeers
Thanks for doing this again ☺️
Jason Vorehees!
Ghost at Campfire spot: turns it to freezing temperatures, breaks the lights and lets a lone ball roll towards Mark to gain his attention but utterly failing. All to show where it spawns.  Mark, Wade and Bob: Hanging around the dock and house  Ghost: Welp.. seems I have to go get them there instead  Really missed them play Phasmophobia, hope there will be more~
more more phasmopobia
Mark please stop using the fucking digital camera, it makes this game so hard to watch
I love how mark just kinda got out of dying the first few minutes I feel like mark, wade and bob make this game so much better than it already is
This makes me so happy.
I even knew it was coming, and Lixian still got me with the moon
More
Oh no a guitar 🎸…..camp fire guitar guy 😦
I seen bobs video first and hearing mark talk to lixein is wired
Hantu? Is it kuntilanak or pocong? 😂
I'm I the only one who thinks Bob's character (The guy in the brown jacket) looks a bit like Shane Madej?
30:25 love that reference
When Bob was throwing the cup it was so horror movie-esc and it was extremely eerie
yay im one of the first 300,000 views😁
11:02 Wade: no it's me. Mark: *is safe* Wade: *dies* Mark: it's happening again everyone is dying around me.
I love it when these 3 play this game, or any game for that matter. Mark, Bob, and Wade are the Holy Trinity
THEY ARE BACK YESSSS Them communicating with bob when he first died was hilarious
"I got bad news!" Mark said calmly
10:48 - 11:14 The music made this even funnier 🤣
I forgot Mark, named himself BumBum
That moment when Mark and Bob were admiring Wade's ass had me out of breath HAHA
25:00 I got the reference. For those that don’t know, it’s an in space with Markiplier reference
Can we talk about how lucky mark would have been drawing both high preistess and hanged man if they werent fool cards. Thats crazy
Yooo
was that an in space reference?
25:04 “cut the yellow wire” is what chose :]
It had been a while since I had to turn the volume down for a video 😂
I’m glad Wug and Bert could get on Phasmophobia with the lead engineer
PLEEEEEEEEEASE play more!! I laughed so hard! It's meant to be scary, but you guys make it so freaking funny!
Ohhhh so you do come back to older games after enough updates.   Can’t wait for that Fall Guys return then…right? 🥺
Yessss!!!! It’s backkkk! I want to play this so bad in vr so bad.
YES! Finally another phasmophobia vid. Please do more Mark.
This is one of the straightest videos I've ever watched

The first hunt had me dying 😭😭😭
YES! I love watching ya'll play this game.
I LOVE THIS GAME WITH THESE PEOPLE
The campsite map is my absolute favorite in Phasmophobia. So many horror movie/game Easter eggs and tributes. Blair witch, Friday The 13th, Scream, its so cool and fun.
THERE'S OUR SCARED SHITLESS MARK!
IM SO GLAD YOU GUYS DID PHASMOPHOBIA AGAIN
Campfire Guitar Guy is the ghost.
Wow funnn
Let's face it - Lixian is the real star of this channel... LOL
I MISSED THIS GAME SO MUCH
FINALLY! MARK BOB AND WADE CONTENT!
I can't unsee it now. I saw a cow in thr thumbnail
I absolutely LOVE phasmohobaiiaaa BB))B)B)B)
I’ve just started playing this game and I LOVE it, I’m so glad mark is finally playing it again

Who else jumped at the moon? 😂
Yyyyyaaaa daby let's gooooo. Love it.😊👌
i was waiting for this for so long lol
The intro was beautiful
Your phasmophobia videos are what made me first subscribe, thank you for continuing :)
Omg I missed this so much 😭
YES!!!!!!
What was the reference to I didn't even catch it 😭😭
I s2g if mark doesn’t shut up when something is hunting 😂
I love Wade's logic. "Oh it's too hard we're not getting content? I still won't drop it down."
Not seen Mark in a while.  Good time to return I think :)
LETS GOOOO
Hello markisexy
I'm so glad this is back
hes back baby
I came here after being a long time listener of the podcast, I didn’t know these guys did YouTube. Very beautiful, very powerful.
I am so happy the Markimoo and Crew are back in Phasmo. Literaly love watching and playing this game.
When are you guys going to play dead by daylight again?
Another phasmo vid hell yeah, AND ALOT OF UPDATES
MARK plz bring back "Hello everybody my name is Markiplier and welcome back to_______" Bring back out child hoods!
Hi!!!
For some reason it didn't notify me when this video uploaded
Now that is a moon i have not seen for ages. The Ocarina of time.
Please play more of this I love this game
Mark, Bob and Wade should make Phasmo a full series together
Cut the yellow wire
I watched bobs perspective really happy to see marks
HE PULLED THE HIGH PRESTIES AND THE HANGMAN WHILE IT WAS HUNTING 🤣🤣
Thank you for another phasmophiba video I love these
I’m glad they came back for this after so many updates and improvement of the game
ITS BACKKK YOOO THE BOYS ARE BACK
Ngl... Majora's moon would be a FANTASTIC Easter egg for this game.
I wonder if Mark and the gang will play the game when the new Sunny Meadows map gets released. (or rather when the Asylum gets reworked!)
Murder is not an action, it’s a concept, a figment of your silly imagination, just a weird concept us humans created, im not murdering anyone. It’s just survival of the fittest, no one shall and must be offended by that, it’s natural selection, really….
Mark and Bob just making wade twerk is the most hilarious thing to me
Watching mark pull all of the cards while it was hunting hurt
Wade your sacrifice will not be forgotten! 🤣
I'm really glad ya'll have been continuing the series. Its funny and scary at the same time lol
When are you going to play Grounded again? That also has had many updates
I was binge watching the old videos yesterday lol
YES
My favourite content is this trio. <3
I didn't get a notification for this, just happened to catch on my home page
I'm so glad you came back to this game I'm still watching the old videos loo
Thank you Mark you were the one who got me playing phasmo! it continues to be my favorite series you've posted!
:/ this video is
We need the Septic Eye involved
Mark, Bob, and Wade should play with Insym...
Mark's sheer disappointment when Bob didn't get the ISWM reference. 😂
Any time Wade is the leader In a game, red flags should be flying.
I'm level 3,566
My literal reaction to this: oh shoot! I love this series
Yknow I’m sitting to think that might have been the death cup
Oh my god I’m crying I’ve been waiting for you guys to play this again for forEVER
Im so glad yall came back to this game! Its a favorite of mine
Nice to see that Mark, Bob, and Wade still haven't changed playing Phasmophobia
About damn time! I’ve been waiting for this!
Even though he announced it I was on the verge of tears on that moon jumpscares
Omg. I cannot believe they're playing it again. I'm liking the video gonna sleep now. I will watch this while eating breakfast. This is heaven.
they need to inspect the whole lobby with a blackk light
LOL YESSS I love this total chaos
We NEEED more. Get good series???
I've been waiting for this for so long
The way they just drop the objects as ghosts I find so funny
I like that Mark pulled the high priestess while in a hunt. 🤣
So glad they came back to this game hope they make more episodes I really love this series
13:26 mom i shit the bed tip: how about being silent so the ghost wont come to you
Lilian needs to step up his junpscare game. I just don't jump and get scared of them at all.
12:26 omfg the cup whizzing by mid-death
I missed these
❤❤❤❤
12:25 “that’s probably a good sign right?” then dies perfect timing
WE NEED MORE!
YES I MISSED THIS
1:08 heyyyy
Absolutely thrilled at Bob's use of Heckin Wimdy after not knowing what the hell Mark was referencing on Distractible
I remember the old intros
Yessss more phasmophobiaaaa
Glad you’re back Mark! Just in time for summer break.
Dammit I wanna game with you guys even though I will refuse to go in the house I could still provide equipment lmao 😂
YYEEESSSSSS
Fun Fact : "Hantu" is literally an Indonesian Translation for "Ghost". So if you actually want to use Phasmophobia as Actual Ghost Hunting Training. Then I suggest you pack up and leave. [20:39]
That intro was legendary
29:30 the sister location bathroom be like
damn... the music in these videos though. can we have some music names listed?
Some helpful tips for this new version are:  Turn off your light, and don't speak when the ghost is hunting.  If you say "I'm scared" or "I'm so scared, the ghost will become more active, similar to when you say the name of the ghost.  Doors can sometimes be used as hiding places if angled properly  The Tarot Cards have a chance of reviving a dead teammate, or can be used as an extra life if drawn before the death of said teammate.  Yokai are very sensitive to noise, do not say it's name when around the ghost room of a Yokai.  The mirror breaks (I think) if it does a full rotation of the room and sees itself  Pick up the car keys (if there is a car) and click on the car to stop the honking   Fingerprints can be found on windows, door, and light switches.  You can place a recording camera on the tripod so you don't take up an extra item slot, but do that last so you can pick up your other 2 items.  The Crucifix does not stop cursed hunts, so do not put that on a summoning circle, it's not going to do anything.  Using the radio during a hunt will make the ghost even more aggressive.  Some ghosts revolve around the status of the fuse box, such as the Jinn.   Dirty water doesn't do anything, it just kinda exists. It might be able to give an objective sometimes, I don't remember.   D.O.T.S can be placed on the wall and floor and it's for seeing an image of the ghost walking around. The Goryo will not appear on D.O.T.S if you are in the room. (Not sure if it is also the house)  Freezing temperatures are sometimes only a sign of a ghost event, and do not count as evidence in that case.  If you see a six fingered handprint, it is either an Obake or a Mimic copying the Obake.  You can change the thermometer from Celsius to Fahrenheit in settings.  The "Escape a ghost during a hunt" objective is rarely worth the risk.  Take pictures of fingerprints, bones, interactions, journal writing, salt footprints, UV footprints (not evidence) for some extra money.   Wraiths hover above the ground, but if they touch salt, they immediately disappear unless it's during a hunt (I think)  The Fool means that whatever effect the tarot cards had, is not true and you've been pranked pet say.  Personally, I do not think head cameras are worth the expense, but that's just in my experience.  Do not use the Ouija Board if you are low on sanity, this will trigger a cursed hunt. Also, if you say hide and seek to it, RUN. Remember to say goodbye when you are done with the Ouija board, or it will explode, and that will also trigger a cursed hunt.   The voodoo doll does not have a 100% chance of starting a hunt, but if the heart pin is touched, hide as fast as you can.  If you crouch under the motion sensor, it will not detect you.  Hope this helps you and anyone else who reads this!
2:10, and I quote  "level TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-SIX"
Make more phasmaphobia Videos
Slenderman is in the campsite level
Man i like the intro, the flying ghost made a nice transition
my face is shocked, im so excited to watch this
So, just in case no one else has said this, the mirror breaks when you're sanity zero.
Just kept pulling the cards. Love it hahahaha
Why, out of every possible player, did Wade say Philip Rivers?? With near 0 confidence, might I add!
YEEESSSSS
Let's go Mark is back with more phasmo... i've been wondering if you were gonna do this again but here we are
yay a markiplier post
YESS!!! FINALLY! anyways it's wonderful to see a new video to be added! You're all awesome. <3
Hell yeah new phasma with the bbbbois!!!
Day 2 of asking Markiplier to play the full version of Janitor Bleeds 😁
No way! He continued Phas!!!
im mark im always the last one alive
i've been deprived of Mark x Lixian comedy content, i NEEEEEED it
the mirror breaks when the user hits 0% sanity while using the mirror
I felt some other form of happiness when I read "Phasmophobia" as a new video. I'm so glad he's back babyyy
9:03
Another one PLEASE!!!!
I was waiting for this video
Yessss! So excited!
YOOOOOO!!!!!!!
FINALLY A COLLAB AGAIN :D
YESSSSSSS ANOTHER PHASMOPHOBIA OMG I HAVE WANTED ONE OF THESE SO BAD
I'm so happy you guys decided to come back to this game!!!
Finally :D Also Mark Getting a fooled hangman as the last card was golden.
On Bob's channel. My still favorite is when Mark got killed inside the house and all you can hear his Mark's faint scream in the background 😂😂😂
“A Certified Hood Classic” 💪🏿
Wade has too much free time if he’s at level ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX!!!!!
Missed this! I need more lol
Lixian put jumpsacre
I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO FUCKING LONG FOR ANOTHER PHASMAPHOBIA VIDEO
The whole time in the first round I knew it was a banshee. The ghost simply ignored everyone else and just left Mark out there to be dumb.
8:26 Mark : _(Draws a Death Card from Taro Stack)_ "I GOT BAD NEWS! I GOT BAD NEWS!!!" Mark : _(Repeatedly gets ridiculed by The Taro Cards by only giving him "The Fool" Cards)_
Did anyone else immediately start thinking of different stands when they where drawing tarot cards?
27:48 John Madden
I've missed phasmophobia
we need Mark to play on nightmare mode
Has Choo Choo Charles come out yet? U said you'd play it in a stream lol Same creator as "My Beautiful Paper Smile "
:0 been a while
1:08 aww she sneezed
I like how marks hair got long then he cut it and now it’s long again
You can also grab the UV-light in the Lobby and take a look around 😉
John madden, that'a a true classic!
3:56 I thought the "Jinn" said "Jim" for a sec and laughed my ass off thinking about "IT'S DEMONS JIM!"
I think that crack sound that plays whenever they die should just be in the game by default. XD
You always make the mistake of listening to Wade when he tells you to go somewhere.
Please make more multiplayer horror games with Bob and Wade like this.
SO EXCITED TO WATCH WILL UPDATE WHEN I FINISH THIS!! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR MARK TO PLAY THIS FOR MONTHS THANK YOU MARKY!!!
Finally MORE PHASMOPHOBIA
I hope there is more of this on it's way
Mark pulling the death card and dying last...hey it still came true XD Anyways keep up the amazing videos Mark
Man, lixian's editing just makes the chaos  and hilarious moments that is Mark, Bob, and Wade, so much funnier.  10:19 - 11:16: Professionals have *standards* 11:26 - 12:57: Wade is *definitely* impressed 15:27 - 15:44 17:48 - 22:34 - 23:25 22:46
phasmaphobia vr please!!!
heres a little tip: you cannot have your electronic equipment on during a hunt. The ghost can target you just like it can target you using your voice.
YESSSS we’ve been waiting for so long!!!!
‌
Mark being the last alive while trying to die the whole time is me every time I play. Like why did all my friends die I'm the only incompetent one.
So happy he has returned, he should get to know insym, he is a pro at this game and it gets a lot deeper than you expect
I've waited a year for this moment. I love when these guys play phasmo.
FFUUUUCCCCKKKKK YYYYEEEEEAAAAAAA PHASMIPHOBIA WAS THE SERIES I WISHED TO BE REMADE
I’ve loved this series and have been wondering when mark would play it again
the moon jumpscare actually got me... oops.
Holy moly LOOK AT WADE LEVEL 1.536 ? Is this even possible ????
my fav series because i’m too scared to play myself, pls make more
32:11 Any last words. UUHGHGHGHG
Lixian was a little too good at turning the moon into a jumpscare ...
When Mark asked Bob to throw the cup if he was going to die then soon having Bob actually throwing immediately as the ghost hunts making Mark yell “OH IM ABOUT TO DIE!!”  Is probably the best and funniest thing that happened to me today— I love all of their humor so much
I love these guys haha
We. Need. More.
The fact that he drew the high priestess and it didn’t work 😭😭
The way I was just close to crying when he kept drawing cards during the hunt and drew a HIGH PRIESTESS -> JOKER  T^T
hey there's a free easter egg in the lobby that gives you resources in the door, what you have to do is look in the door and walk in it
I miss these gaming sessions with the bois
more phasmo, more fun
More phasmophobia!!!!!! Love this content
Yooooooo
When mark says “ well this gost is a little aggressive” I died laughing🤣
I’m getting. Déjà vu
football: *appears bouncing*  Mark: *doesn't notice*
Is mark starting to get loud again? I would love that!
I BEEN WAITIN FOR THIS ONE…TURN IT UP!
I like how Wade is level 1,536 and then there's Mark and Bob.
Oooh tarot cards
It was nice seeing you three back together again. You need to do it more often. It's hilarious
majoras mask moon :D
YESSSS I LOVE THIS SERIES
Who can't wait till phasmophobia comes to Xbox!
the high priest card in the first hunt, i cried, out of laugher xD
Love it.
I'm laughing too hard, Wade's ultimate sacrifice just to spite Mark 🤣 Also that corner is mostly an invincibility corner, when I get hunted I rush that direction with reckless abandon and smash my face into the potted plant and 70% of the time I survive if at the right angle
bro i first learned of the chick in the bathroom and the ghost in the cieling during halloween bc me and my friend played a lot but i still dont like to read patchnotes, just kinda go along with how it feels. great friend
So the add, google certificates, an add in your view, could you tell me more about that that and how you used that to improve your content or my experience?
I have been waiting for this since the last phas episode and am super glad it came. I hope they do more phas and mark goes back to doing 3 scary games more often.
YES ITS BACK
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
17:50 BUTT CAM!!!😂🙏🤩
ITS MY BDAY TODAY !!
Bro it took you like 2-4 days to post this and again it takes editing so fair
I WOULD CUT OFF 3 OF MY FAVORITE LIMBS TO PLAY WITH MARK I AINT EVEN JOKING
You wade and bob should try playing Devour
Omg, It's felt like forever that these 3 played
yeahhhh!!! phasmophobia is back!
Yes!!! More content like this! LIKE IF YOU AGREE.
I legit watch any and every video with this trio, even if I don't care about the game itself, because the dynamic is too chaotic to pass up
It’s awesome that he’s playing the newer updates with other players 👍👌🔥
So glad this is back!!!
YES, PLEASE KEEP PLAYING PHASMOPHOBIA I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS ON THIS GAME!
“Lixian, put a jumpscare on that moon!” *Majora’s mask*
Bob: “Wade and I are both really good at this Mark, what have YOU been doing?” Me: *Do you know the bodies in the wormhole?*
Wow money for the picture of some body's dead foot.
Anyone else catch the Jojo reference?
That is a lot of updates. The updates are cool and this is very inspiring. The calm mean-ness is really cool and the way the people who are present in the video interact. Now for a five paragraph essay:          the    first para      second para              third para        fourth       fivth (fiv-ith)            paragrahposdf
First time that door jumpscare happened to me I fell of my chair screaming and woke everyone in my house up... haven't played since
Hantu:ghost in malaysia
Do more Phasmophobia w/ Bob & Wade
Game: "This is an update. Probably new stuff you should check out." Also Game: "Same boring death scenes, btw." I mean, can we have some variety for the different ghosts, pls?
My dad's name is John Madden so its weird to hear Mark say it at random.
YESSSS!!!!!!!
me, looking away from the screen when mark is going to the room wade told him about to avoid getting scared: 😌  it being an auditory jumpscare: 😨
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR A PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEO FOR SK LONG
YESSSS! love it when you 3 play this
MORE PHASMOFOBIA
Why don’t y’all play with jack anymore?
Wade being "No me!" XD and just saying "you're on your own mark"
Why does Wade spend so much time in games like this? Level 1536?? Bro...
I will never get used to how well Lixian edits these great job.
Wades sacrifice 😔
Really missed watching you guys play Phasmophobia, I'm so happy to see that this series has returned!
What happened to Jack ?
I love this ⭐️🤣
I am excited
Mark has infinite energy
The amount of times I've rewatched the original release of phasmo videos, I'm glad there is new content to see.
I so happy they played this game again :D
Yay im the first comment 😁
The episode where wade starts an onlyfans
Mark: wade u level 1000 Wade:someone has to carry the team Also wade the first person to die
As a veteran (albeit more old school than up-to-date) Phasmo player, I love how I can feel second hand pain from Wade trying so desperately to play the game properly and keep the mission afloat as the only experienced player there, meanwhile Mark and Bob are actively sabotaging everything by being big dumb-dumbs in the background.
Omg he speaking to us..
hi insym
No Jacksepticeye what a sad moment
Feels great when you finish the playlist then Mark posts a new episode outta nowhere
I just love how wade is level 1500 for no apparent reasons
i really wanted them to do this!!! i literally thought to myself: if i ever see Mark irl, i'll tell him to play Phasmo again
Yes Ghost time
What a great ghost hunting video, I think they got 1/3 correct. Very nice! Lol
Mark is just the best, he can raise anyones mood by a lot under one minute.
I have been rewatching the last phasma series for a year, thank you thank you
Hey markimoo! I just watched a great analog horror movie called Choose Or Die and I think you'd love it! Check it out!
Hello everyone my name is Markiplier welcome back to Phasmophobia
I hope one day to have the connection mark, Bob, and wade have. True friendship ✨
Finally its back
Nice intro.
11/10 intro.
Finally!! I was waiting for this game to be played by you guys again! Always rewatch your original phasmaphobia video 😀
We need more of these 😂
I've been going through some things and dealing with depression lately but your videos with Bob and Wade make me feel better. I smile and laugh when watching your content. Honestly, thank you so much for what you've done through the years Mark 🖤
"I got bad news! Wheel of fortune! The fool! I got bad news! I got bad news! The hermit! The fool! I got bad news! I got bad news! The tower! The fool! I got bad news!" Professor Farnsworth would not be happy.   On a side note. My god. Mark got INSANELY lucky that any card you draw during a hunt is a fool card. When it looked like the hunt was over and he drew the final card it was the hanged man. Which INSTANTLY kills the player. If that hunt wasn't still going he would have absolutely died for sure because of that last card. But the hunt still going turned it into a fool which saved his life.
20:31 Wades Onlyfans
I cannot believe that Bob didn't get the camp reference from In Space With Markiplier..... My God Bob!
The boys are back in town
How did Mark die with High Priestess lol ???
bob: "yeah it can hear you when its hunting" mark: this sign cant stop me because I cant read!
YES OH MY GOD IVE BEEN DYING TO SEE MORE MARKIPLIER PLAYING PHASMO
Hey Markiplier just what to say that you are my favorite YouTuber keep up the the video love them
Phasmophobia is back! Yay!
Hope my ex is doing alright, haven't heard from her in a long time, but i know she likes watching Mark's videos when Bob and Wade are in them
<3
Lets go, I kept watching your old phasmaphobia videos because they were intresting and was hoping that you would play it again.
Cant believe the moon jumpscare actually got me 😔
I missed these three playing this. Always a hilarious time!
I’ve now watched this from all three perspectives and omg Mark you are so loud and chaotic 😂😂😂 but I think my fave parts was the “LIXIAN!! Add a jump scare!!”  For some reason you hollaring at Lixian while recording had me laughing!!
Mark makes a reference to ISWM in every single video now
5:16 I think I just had a heart attack lol
Mark you should play Mr hopps playhouse 2 I think it's out
yay back with the phasmophobia!
OUR CHAOS IS HEEEEEEEEREEEE
I have just bought Phasmophobia and this makes me want to play it LESS!
now we gotta see mark play scp: secret laboratory
YEEED PHASMOPHOBIAAA this game is brilliant I mf love this trio
Play this with Mat Pat XD
Wade level 1,536
YEESSSS PHASMAPHOBIA!
I'm so happy I was in such a bad mood and I went to watch old phasmaphobia videos because they brighten my day. Imagine my surprise when I found a recent one!! 💗
Omggg yesssssssssssssssssss
7:05 i though bobs shadow was the ghost
Mark is now making videos fast in 2022
We want another GTFO episode
i remember when he kept getting chased in the school and somehow survived
I never thought that they would play phasmophobia again! It's fun to see them playing it again
Bob and Wade are the best commentators 😂
1:39 It’s Stewart’s cousin, Steve!        Stewart is my emotional support skeleton I got from Walmart and have in my bedroom btw.
You guys may want to check out Ghost Exile. It's REALLY good and has a lot to offer!
I am so happy to see you play this game again
Mark!! If you didn’t see the update coming soon you should totally check it out!!!
I was fully convinced Mark somehow joined a random game at 2:45
when wade designated the ghost, blindly as a cougar aye guff awed
I hope you guys continue to play phasmo!! There is another old friend in the woods map :) he is dying to get a hug with his monkey arms
MORE PHASMAPHOBIA LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
This is one of my all time favorites series with the three of you aside from the forest. So glad to see y’all back in it!
They need another series of this
I MISSED THIS CONTENT!
Mark just casually picking up the hanged man fool card without knowing what it means 💀💀
Skeleton in the closet? Must've starved themselves in the fear of being involved with the van
this was aperfect gift on my birthday...thank you lol
God the last time Mark played was when the prison came out…SO MUCH HAS CHANGED!!! 😃😍
YESS ANOTHER PHASMOPHOBIA VID 🤣👍🏻🫀
@24:46 - @24:56 WhaT
I squealed  when I saw the title!
Back to formula and all the better for it.
24:50  Gold
I'm expecting a full series just causes this games great
Mark: *Gets spooked by the safe house* Bob: "Hahaha!" *approaches door* "Nothings's actually happening.  It's a joke." *gets spooked* "Gah! Jesus!" Mark: "Hahahaha!"
I’m a simple being I see; “Mark, Bob, & Wade” I click and watch
Bro the jojo references were so... strange
Hay Mark you should look at insyms vids he is at level 8000 I believe
"When it's hunting, be quiet." Hunt starts, Mark talks non-stop. Great.
He drew a Death card... and survived...... I mean.... Is Mark God?
Hey mark Idk if you will see this but a game you should play is Hollow Knight its a really fun game and I think you would like it
The fact that mark could of resurrected bob and then killed himself is amazing
Omggg you don't know how happy i am now that your back to regular uploading (hopefully) thank you for everything mark! You are absolutely the best!
i watched it first in bobs channel but i’ll still rewatch lol
The big return!!
Markiplier is very scary
It's 4 am, I'm home alone, there's a storm outside and my power went out halfway through. My brain: "I got bad news"
Finally been waiting since i saw Bob and wade post
Excuse me?! Wade is Level WHAT?!
been such a long time since he did phasmophobia
LEEEEEEEETTTTTS GOOOOOO
John Madden JoHn MaDdEn JoHN MADDen jOhN maDDEN john maDDen
THANK GOD he posted another phas video
XD lmao 🤣 y’all play together more plz
At 12:28 when the cup get thrown at mark I lost it 😂😂😂
I'm so stupid when mark said at the beginning he needs a flashlight, I scrolled down my screen at that moment switch on my flashlight with a big smile on my face thinking "there you go buddy" and the screen didn't light up.🤣😂 I was like wtf I'm so stupid
Hey Mark I dont think you ever finished Amnesia rebirth.
Amazing to see them back!
please play more phasmo😫
I'm so glad they are back to playing Phasmophobia!  It's one of my favorite games of theirs next to Uno!
This is my safe space though
Glad you guys are revisiting this game - it's excellent and the developers are tremendous.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!!
remember when you could just do the evidence and get the ghost
Please, please, PLEASE! Keep doing phasmophobia videos. This is the best and funniest series I have ever seen.
Ghost hunting with friends!👻👍
Finally I can watch phasma phobia
The moon jump scare made me flinch a lil. So rude.
I love the fact that Mark was already anticipating a scare when he was asked to get something from another room in the safe house.  My boyfriend has pulled that so many times on friends since it was added.
Lixian the one and only bad ass Editor making Marks intros a legend!
nice
Before I watch this, I just wanna say I’m so happy to see you play this again. I love playing this game myself and the amount of updates it’s gotten is beyond incredible and the devs of this game, CJ, DK, Lavender, and now Skinner, are all special people and deserve all the love they’ve gotten.
Give Lixian some Mercy mark.
The skeleton falling out of the closet at  1:37 gave me a heist with markiplier vibes.
its funny as he says "ah lemme get a photo of that" lol
i love how bob throws that last cup at mark's face half second right before he is about to have a metaphysichal eyes surgery, he asked for a danger warning cup i guess
Would love to see you guys play phasmophobia in VR
I'm soo glad you're doing this again. It just seemed that doing the VR ended the playlist blank
i miss this never leave
Glad that Phasmophobia is back, would have been cool if jack played too
YESSS YOUR BACK WITH PHASMOPHOBIA
30:25 I think I know which camp this is now 😳
So happy you guys are playing this again!!!!!
mark where is the rest of manual samual
I love you so much Mark thanks for coming back to this game I’ve been waiting for a long time
Hi
27:36 so I’m not going insane here but that Is the Blair witch project totems that are in the game right? If so I would never pick that up in a million years
funniest shit. i always like watching bob and wade's versions of the game but Mark's is always the most entertaining editing-wise.
i love how Wade says that talking during the hunt will kill you and Mark consistently talks on the radio lmaoooo, poor Bob
Pls revisit raft
Watching Mark get away with pulling the Death card and then proceeding to YELL THE WHOLE TIME without dying has me flabbergasted.
Prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt prop hunt
The first thing Mark heard when he met bob and wade on the other side  *Tried to throw the cup at you, Mark*  Gets me every time.
why does this reminds me exactly of that one roblox game specter
All paranormal investigators try to make a porno during the investigation, yes very normal 😂😂😂😂😂😂 fucking hilarious
Please play this more often, it’s definitely one of my favorite games so far !!
Hi
10:38  This is probably my favorite moment in this video and I haven't even finished it 🤣  Once Wade stepped out and said "No" I LOST IT Everything else after that is gold ✨️
Why no Jacksepticeye?
I would love too see a Distractables Episode where they talk about a topic but it is done in phasmophobia during maps so if it hunts, whoever dies looses points
i missed the bob mark and wade videos
YES IVE BEEN WAITIJG FOR THIS
FINALLY  BACK!!
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE! TURN IT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo Markiplier when is the next time you play risk of rain 2.
mark you can place the camera on the tripod and pick up the tripod with the camera on it
You should do more of phasmophobia
This is probably a long shot, but, does anyone know what the song used in the joke intro was?
I’ve missed this series
YEEEEESSSSS I LOVE THIS
Mark stop posting! I can't watch anything till saturday, you're making me have a backlog of videos
Slow down on the content! I'm still trying to finish the Stanley Parable. 🤣     I'm joking.... I'll catch up eventually.
John Madden John Madden aeiou aeiou aeiou aeiou John Madden
It looked like wade broke his own neck in front of him lol 😆
I was just binging the Phasmo playlist the other day and thought the series had ended! Glad to see it's back :)
I'm sad they didn't see Slenderman at the campsite
More!
Games with friends are always so good. I’m glad they revisited this game
Mark: John Madden!  Me: Snake. Snake? SaAAaaAaAake!
Incredible... For the first time i have seen. A youtuber has finally gone back to a game after it got a mass variety of updates over a year. Thank you Mark. Thank you so much.
So glad to see this series back!
The fucking moon scared the shit outta me
So happy you guys are playing again! the game has gotten so much better since you last played!
the moment when mark got the high priestess during the hunt and it got fooled was awesome
Camping with Markiplier
He really hasn’t done an intro in a while.
Marks point of view is always better, no offense Bob and wade. 😂 The sound effects really add to the experience. Good job Rachel @rad_R 👍👍
ive been waiting FOR THIS!
Thanks Mark, really needed a laugh at the moment
What level is wade now, 80085?  Edit: Just seen what level he is, lol.
Can we just talk about how hard Mark has been working recently?
Finally returning to the greatest ghost huntin game
❤️
"well maybe i will put my dick on the tripod" well thanks spit out my water onto my keyboard
The chaos emanating from this video is great
Ah shit, here we go again
Editing mistake  The title is wrong  It’s Burt and wug
25:00 what is it a reference to?
3:35 Ghost huntin‘: It ain‘t much but its honest work.
Ain't tarot cards the curse object in this game?
Please more phasmaphobia weve missed it🥲
mark bob and wade best trio!!
YESSSSS  I was waitin for this
Can you do a series on this?
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS NOW ITS BEEN DELIVERED
lmao please do more yall are so funny
Thank you I need to see this today I just lost my job
i was rewatching the series and here i am
nice to see this again
This came at the best time. I was binge watching the Phasmophobia playlist this morning.
Has to be my favorite game that Mark Wade and Bob play, so happy there’s a new one, been watching replays the past few months 😂
I MISSED THIS
Now you need to do a Vr since that also got overhauled But when you just started spamming those tarot cards I could stop laughing! it was funny as hell!
Wade's 286! 286!!!
Heck yeah I've been itching for a new Phasmophobia video from Markiplier for months.
That tarot deck was wild, a high priestess and hangman in one deck is pretty rare
It's back, THANK GOD I missed them playing this :')
No way mark I just went through a phase of rewatching your phasmaphobia videos like last night that’s crazy
Mark "Why don't we drop the difficulty a bit down"  We don't talk about the ones below professional......
MORE
Number of likes is how many legends there are out there!! (On the video, not this comment. But hey, feel free😁)
Mark: *uploads* Time: 23:56 Me: *waking up at 6am for school tomorow* Also me: “sleep is for weak”
25:56 FooTball
Mark right now I’m sick with covid and you and your videos just like when I was a kid has been helping me so much to just distract myself and feel better,Everytime I get anxiety or panic attacks I literally will watch you videos until I fall asleep I love you so much and I never wanna stop watching.💜☺️
PLEASE MORE MARK I LOVE THIE SERIES
mark. graystillplays saw your poppy play time vid and made someone make a board on gta 5
Today is my birthday
We are all sinners and the price of sin is death. Because we are sinners, we cannot be in the presence of a perfect God. That is why Jesus came. He came, lived a perfect life, and took our sin and died for us. By believing in Him and trusting in Him, He washes us from our sin. Please come to Him. Ask Him to reveal Himself to you and ask Him to come into your heart.
more Phasmophobia!
YEEEEEEESSSSS
Imagine if he made a vr phasmophobia  video
IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR MORE PHASMOPHOBIA!!!! I’m so excited!!!!!
Lixian really nailed the editing on this one!  But really when does he not
24:52   Mark: Bob? Bob: disappears  Lixian: Edits the video to have the *what* meme template
I love watching this madness it cracks me up with laughing so hard
Wasn't the Hanged Man insta-death? Why didn't Mark die there then?
Thank you Markiplier and Lixian for jump-scaring my night time headache away! :D
The boys are back
DO MORE PHASMOPHOBIA!! Get Jacksepticeye back too! I always die laughing when I watch your Phasmophobia videos!!
I’m not the only one who saw a goat in the thumbnail right
plz make a phasmophobia series with bob and wade i will wacht all of them they are varey funny
Mark you missed slender man in the woods
day five of asking you to play iron lung
I love this. I love you guys. You're all so talented and amazing human beings, not just the 3 of you but Amy, Ethan, Jack, everyone is so amazing. I wish you all sweet dreams and a happy life. You all deserve every good thing that happens to you ❤
Im always waiting for mark to play my favorite games: poppy playtime and this!
p[leaser do another series again, its funny and halarious seeing you guys have fun in phasmo
Mr editor please don't
YEEEEEEEESSSSS IVE BEEEN WAITINGGG
Mark you are great
Ji
Bob: "Mark I think he killed you" Also Bob: "Mark did you get my messages from the beyond?"
I was waiting for this vid my whole life
You guys should give V rising a shot!
I watched this from bob’s perspective a few days ago and honestly hearing mark quietly in the background go “Lixian do xyz” is funnier to me than it should be
It's good to see them back to Phasmophobia
HELL YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I’ve been waiting for this for MONTHS LETS GO
I'm so happy they're playing more Phas. Its so much fun
I love this game! I’ve watched the series of y’all playing this game too much, I love y’all’s gameplay on this!
Nice video markiplier
It’s back boys!!
Finally... i was waiting for this my entire life
MARK be a beacon of hope and prosperity and play valhiem
ngl havent even started watching but I did miss this great having it back for maybe few more videos
i loved this series
Omg, mark bob and wade gameplay! It's been so long ♥️
More of this game please and put this into playlist as well
HAHAHA Mark pulled the high preistess which would of revived bob but becuase the ghost was hunting IT DIDNT WORK
Yesssss mark i send a retweet for wades birthday tweet I asked for this YESSSSSSSS
Is his hair really this long again?
Far be it from me to shame anyone for playing a game they spent their money on in the way they want to, but I'm gonna say as someone who's in the 100s of levels in this game, seeing Mark and Bob immediately do everything wrong and die is simultaneously hilarious and infuriating. They don't get a lot of time to figure things out because they just immediately piss off the ghost and die. Not even 10 minutes into the video yet, but I felt a need to mention that. Hopefully, they figure it out by the end and get further along?  In the end, they almost had it. Darn. Honestly would love them to do a series where they actually learn stuff about the game. I dunno how long Mark's attention will stick around to try it, but seeing Wade as the parent is a fun adventure.
Finally, I'm so happy you guys came back to phasmophobia.
Yay! I missed phasmaphobia
MY FAV TRIO !!!
Oh hell yeah
Man, I wish I could play with y'all... I love playing this game with friends.
the Series is BACK
USE THE UV LIGHT IN THE SERVER LOBBY, THERE ARE SURPRISE MESSAGES ALL OVER THE WALLS AND FLOORS :3
Finally
Has bob never seen ISWM 2? 😐
I made a story game for my girlfriend in Minecraft from your inspirational words. You are the most amazing story teller, actor, and person Mark. You are our biggest and shiniest star Mark
This chaos is literally just me and my friends 😂😭
Hey Mark would you play Factorio again and finish the death world.
I had a really hard day with semester test and this made my day when i got home
Was hoping they’d play again someday.. I am so happy!
l love markiplier and a nice mustache also congrats on 33 million subscribers
7:15   OH.... OH NO
he FINALLY played it again
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER THANK GOD ITS BACK
Make more🤩
WOOOOO, YEEAAHHH BAABBYYY
Deez chain
now play powerwashing simulator
This has been recorded a while ago it seems.
Ah yes, back to the times of markiplier screaming in horror while Shawn and wade (I think wade) laugh there arses off to the muffled sound at the front door. While everyone else watching there videos does the same
Mark, you gotta have bob and wade on more often for this channel. I believe theyre all so so by themselves but together theyre so good.
Yay
When the world needed them most, they returned!
I was just watching through the other Phasmo videos you had up when I saw this get uploaded.  Talk about timing XD
if i could use that KSI "YES YES YES YES YES" meme rn i would spam it      FINALLY ANOTHER PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEOOOOOO LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Damn I remember when they were good
11:00
WOOOO ITS RETURNED
yesss i love when you guys play phasmo i missed it
I’m going insane
i cant remember that last phasmophobia video they did together but its great to see a new one
Yes!  The team is back. Lol.
this is my favorite game and i love watching people play it together <3
Eye, the boys are back.
Please play more of this
Barotrauma when?
Me: More Phasmophobia, We Need more Spookage! Mark: Way Ahead of you.
WAKE UP SON, MORE PHASMO JUST DROPPED.
i love when you guys do phasmophobia its so hilarious
YESSS I MISSED THIS PHASMOPHOBIA TRIO
Haha
I was anxiously waiting for Marks perspective on the warning cup
I was watching this whole thing a while ago and I love it so much
I play phas: the ghost knows exactly where I am, the time I was born and is currently on its way to tickle my balls. They play phas: the ghost is busy taking a shower and planning a tea party while they scream in the living room
i love how mark and bob havent played this in so long that wade had to re explain the game hfdskfdsf
He mentioned LEX! It's been so long, I was wondering where he went. Who else missed his little figure which would come on screen when make started talking with him?
my brain hurts when people dont play games properly or at least not my way
More please 🙏
Sorry Lixian but I’ve played too much majoras mask! Immediately after that though a fork or something slid down a slanted plate in my kitchen and scared the shit out of me.
THE BOYS ARE BACK
Mark you should play with jack again
For someone who games professionally, and as a job, Mark is REALLY bad at games. Not saying it's not entertaining, but generally, when you know someone or something is coming to kill you, you hide. Mark just stands there, waiting and hoping that the ghost will just change its mind... Again, it's entertaining, but at some point, he's gotta learn, right?
I like watching Mark play phasmophobia with Bob and Wade, and since the game’s new updates made he game better, I hope Mark plays the game a little more.
Holy woah what a coincidence I was recently rewatching the phasmaphobia series
Wade: No, me! I'm sorry you're on your own now, Mark. Mark: Haha- what do you mean? [Dramatic music plays over Wade fucking dying] Mark: OH GOD WHA-  Mark radiates main character energy
Is it bad that the moon scared me?
the realization after saying star seeing T-T (5:31)  "im married, oh god. fuck"
YES YES YES YES
e
Glad to see them playing together making this type of thing again
YES more markaplier Phasmophobia yay
Lixian's edits are supreme, Mark must keep him forever.
Where is the full stream!! I enjoy the streams more than the cut versions.
Love that the devs are still updating this game! Just also hope that they someday add more jumpscares and deathanimations. Dying is way less scary right now than a random noise coming along every so often.
I'm sorry but Wade's last death was too funny
OMG YES!! I was just binge watching the phasmo vids earlier wishing they would do another one >^<
Anyone else think of the Hantu Tatek when they saw Hantu on the list?
heck yeah!! I've been waiting for the return of Phasmophobia for so long!
Hope we're gonna have another batch of  UNO vidss soon...
Mwb!
Yay this makes me so happy! 😃
AAAAAAAA ITS BAAAACKKK
Best part of the newness in the video, theres alot more in the works, alot of it looks very good, new UI and such
Since there’s a Hantu designation on the list of ghosts, does that mean they added they Hantu Tetek?
Yes omg I'm so happy you're playing this again. Hands down my favorite series of yours!!
More of this please , Honestly I would pay for a twice a week episode of you guys playing games together ,like big foot ,phasmophobia and all those hunt a scary thing thing games .I would rather that than anything on netflix .
LETS GOOOOOOOOO  No one: Mark: It’s only bad if it goes ORHGHRHGHHRAAAAUGH
I was binge watching the series and i just saw a new episode was released thanks for coming back to this series
Oh, that John Madden reference :D Hilarious... :P
Mark check the walls in the safe house of Phasmophobia!
I watch Insym all the time and seeing people struggle is hilarious.
“Time to hunt ghosts!” ‘Yeah!’ ~Can we add adultery to it?~ “‘HELL YEAH!’”  It’s hilarious how the three can hunt ghosts and make so many jokes at the same time. Great friends.
At this point Lixian turns everything in jumpscares 😂😂
oh man i haven't heard the scary games outro in a hot minute
there's a UV flashlight in the starting area that you can pick up and see stuff on the walls
2:05
Wade was very stoic while sacrificing himself, how cool
“Your on your own now” *laughing* *wade straight up dies* “OH GOD” 💖💖💖
11:00 I almost chocked laughing at Wade XD
0:12 Cute ghost
i missed these videos!
I stopped watching this video after the intro, it can't get any better
I can't tell if its some sort of prejudice, but I saw that wade came out with new phasmophobia videos, but my brain said "NO WAIt FOR MaRk"
If every intro was like this video's, we would be living in 3033
I was fucking waiting future me?
Yeah more phas!
i’ve been WAITING for mark to return to phasmophobia
Holy shit. I somehow didn't get the notification for this. I'm excited to see them tackle this game.
Let’s go
OH MY GOD YESSS
Holy crap it's back
This game just became a JoJo reference, and I'm all for it!
Mark: Bob if am about to die throw coffee cup on me  Music playing  Wade: if you dare, you dare no me. That's right you on your own now mark. (Neck broke)
yay more Phasmophobia
Dude I’ve been waiting for new Phasmophobia content from Mark for a loooooonnnggg tiiimmmeee
the "YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN NOW MARK" and Wade snapping his own neck was more dramatic than most horror movies ive seen
As a Markiplier fan I am very happy. As a Phasmo player.. this gives me a headache lmao
YASSS PHASMOPHPOBIA IS BACK I LOVE THIS SERIES
After listening to a podcast today with you guys ..nothing better than ending day w phasmophobia!
Hey! I knew it’d be hilarious if they played this again XD
I used too watch the old videos over and iver because they were hilarious but this is a whole new ball game and if this turns into a series it would be killer😂😂😂
2:20 how bad is his math?
I like watching you guys play this game
Yay Marki Posting again regularly 😼
YES YES YES YEEESSS
Been waiting for more Phasmophobia for years, YES!
I never stopped laughing throughout the entire video, this was great! Well, off to rewatch the others 🤣
Yes....yes..........I've waited so long :)
NEVER BEEN MORE HAPPY TO SEE U BACK PLAYING A GAME BEFORE
So happy to see them back together!
I love how Wade asking, "Are we doing intros," is effectively their intro when they play together, now
I've been waiting forever for another phasmophobia vid.
I'm so glad you are continuing the series so many years later and I miss Mark's screams of terror
I miss seeing Lixian pop himself in the videos but Ig that's to much work :(
"What you been doing, Mark"  In space...
I could watch them play this forever 🥺🥺
Great video to watch at 10:15 pm
Mark: Lixian turn the moon into a jumpscare Me, half paying attention: Wait what **majora's mask scare** Me, ready to chuck my laptop across the room: HOLY- why is the moon attacking me as of late? ＞﹏＜
😅as always .. hi Mark👋
Flying gorilla add
YESSSS MORE 3 PEENS
Mark & Bob: Making a sex tape of Wade Ghost: "Well this is new..."
Yes! I missed mark, bob, and wade playing together they are hilarious
2% ghost hunting 98% sexual tension between mark and wade
0:20 that house looks rather familiar, y8 Perhaps?
RIP Mark, Wade and Bob. Especially poor Bob, who died 3 times
You NEED to play this with Insym the youtuber/streamer. That would make an incredible video
Mark, you are a blessing to alot of people. Espically myself. When everything around me is black and gray, you still manage to make me laugh. Thanks for that buddy
I have been waiting for this fir so long!!!!
I've been waiting for you guys to play this again for months. XD
We all know what Wade was doing during quarantine to get level 1500
Mark plz make more phasmaphopia
Im shaking and cryn rn
the moon jump scare was from an old legends of zelda game.
The moment Mark noticed the deck of cards I knew disaster was about to happen
I love these
Wade: we have to be quite when the ghost is hunting Mark: *makes it his mission to talk as much as possible when the ghost is hunting*   ironic that he was the last to die
5:19 plot twist, you’re playing as young Link in the Ikana canyon
142,425th
man i really hope this is a sign that Mark. Bob, and Wade do more phasmo this game is super fun to watch
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS!!! THANKS A TON MARK!😁
Oh hell yeah, the gold content is back!
Ooo! Didn't think we would get more of this game
how did mark literally tell rachel to turn the moon into a jump scare and I STILL GOT SCARED
I CAN'T CATCH UP YOU ARE SENDING SO MANY VIDEOS AND I CAN'T SKIP ANY BECAUSE THEY ARE ALLL WORTH IT AHHHHHHHHHH                      BTW, I heard the worst insult is "I hope you step on a lego"
Yay
I love this series I watch The full version (7 hour one) every night
Advice: Turn off all electronics during hunts because ghosts can easily track all electronics that are ON and kill you (THAT INCLUDES YOUR FLASHLIGHT)
Wade: trying to play the game Bob and Mark: thirsting for Wade
I LOVE these videos. I hope you guys do more!
took you long enough
Omg yesssss their back with the ghosty!!!! 😆😆😆😁😁👻👻👻👻
I would love an animation for this
John Madden! John Madden! John Madden! FOOTBALL!! And also a hearty Aeiou to you Markiplier
so awesome to see y'all playing phasmophobia again!
Ghost!?!?
The moon jump scare genuinely terrified me
Damn im missing sean😂
How did this mf not die after pulling a hanged man card? 😂
17:11 I swear, I havent laughed that hard in a good long while. I couldn't breathe for a few minutes, especially when the music came in @17:48. Even my dogs were concerned for me. 💀💀 18:06 oh my godddddssss
like so mark gets to see this. Mark bring back subnautica below zero, its fully out now and everyone wants to see it.
I just watched all his Phas Vids like not even a month ago for the first time and now he's making more again. Very Nice!
i started shaking and crying and throwing up when I saw this, I've been so excited for Mark to see the new updates ;-;
I don't think your not suppose to pull the tarot cards when it's hunting bc it won't work! Also keep looking for useful item in the map they add new items in the house
i am here now slep aesdf
you are the best youtuber that actually play games more than try not to laugh and these side gaming stuff,as always be the best
I miss them playing phasmo, now I  happy that ever
I'm seriously so happy to see you back Mark. 🥺♡ You seriously bring me so much joy during my roughest days. Thank you so much. 💕
Nah the friendly ghosts telling mark what he already knows its just soooo helpful and is exactly what i would do to my friends honestly. ( quote: "Mark i think he killed you" Mark Be like: "oh really i hadn't noticed".) 🤦‍♂️🤣
Me: Seeing a new Phasmophobia video out My mind: *Mark’s torturous inner-house scream :)*
make this a series again please.
YESSS! I have been dreaming of Mark to play phasmo again!
I sure do love Bob yelling only in my left ear
The moon
MARK YOURE GIVIBG ME TOO MUCH TO WATCH NOW
YEEEES I LOVE YOUR PHASMOPHOBIA SERIES IM SO HAPPY ITS BACK
if you talk when you hear footsteps, you have a higher chance of death
I love this trio😂
I love when y’all play Phasmophobia
This game has been updated so much and it's awesome
I was literally just rewatching the series
When is the new GTFO episode?
Play ground again
ThE HaNtU TeTeK I kNeW It
Please we need more phasmophobia content <3
WE NEED MORE! IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS AND PHASMOPHOBIA IS FINALLY BACK! YESSSSSSS
NO WAY HE PLAYED PHASMOPHOBIA AGAIDJWKDEND NO SIJEJ
holy shit this game is so cool now, I would love to see more
Of course it was a Hantu, the Giggity Ghost has come for them!
games we need back from mark fears to fathom, welcome to the game
interesting how they didnt add all items
there is a giant enemy spider meme with u in it
What was the 'howdy camper' referencing?
I love to see the phasmo back, I loved the first couple of videos back when it released
12:15 Yooo i have like 5 exact of these bunnies, they are my most valuable plushy that i would never sell them!
FUUUUUUCK YAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!!!! FUCK YES MARK!!!!! COULDNT WAIT FOR THIS!!
Wade: This is the worst hunt I've been on. Also Wade: *Doesn't explain the game at all*
God I missed these 3 on Phas!! Always love these videos!!
Love how Mark couldn't stop drawing cards and didn't die.
I’ve been waiting for this for so long I think it’s been a year
8:26 The man draws ressurection and instant death under the same hunt. That is impressive. Too bad that it doesn't work under a hunt.
cards;"exist"  "fans":😈
I’m also here for it
Playing this in VR is a whole other experience...
finally
Jump scare of Majora’s Mask moon…revisiting the nightmares of my child. ☠️
IVE LITERALLY BEEN REWATCHING YOUR PHASMAPHOBIA VIDEOS ON REPEAT IM SO EXCITED
I gotta say, Wade sacrificing himself at the first location was even more badass from Mark's perspective.  Bob's emergency coffee cup manifestation was doubly hilarious from Mark's perspective, given that it surprisingly disappears while held by a dead player and reappears after being thrown.
Yes finally my favourite trio is back
happiness :)
I love phasmaphobia
I'm here for the chaos
i have seen this one
7:03 well you better go catch it
YES MORE PHAS
As soon as I saw the the letters p h and a in the title I freaked out, I missed this playlist, love your vids mark
Like how they have yokai as a ghost but it's actually multiple types of ghost. Oni and yurai being two of them lmao
FINALLY! I’ve been waiting for another gameplay of this
15:28 lmao
I love that Mark pulls the death card, talks during hunts, and stands in the open but doesn't die
yo wasssup mark
I'VE WANTED PHASMAPHOBIA TO COME BACK FOR SO LONG. Of all of the recent trending games this was by far my favorite
Been waiting soooo long for this!
Lmaoo
Bob the friendly ghost.
Here he is. 🤗
Space engineers
Awesome guys, I missed this
Bob goes full blink182 at around 5:50 and it’s incredibly funny to me
dont worry level get all reset soon
The game may be dead but I do not care
Mark you should play phasmophobia with Insym
I LOVE BINDGING THIS GAMEPLAY. I HAVE WATCHED YOU AND 4 OTHER YOUTUBERS' PLAYLISTS ATLEAST 5 DIFFERENT TIMES
Please do more episodes of updated phasmobia plzzzz
Super hyped to see this. Watched Bob and Wade's perspectives first, and it's always fun seeing how differently you three approach the game. I hope to see you guys play even more Phasmophobia. There is a whole lotta content you still have to experience! I know Wade played this game religiously for some time, so I'd love to see him carry even more playthroughs ❤
YES FINALLY I've been waiting so long
yes
A part of me is enjoying the amazing Phasmo content from Mark but another part is yelling at my monitor, trying to tell him how to play 🤣
Im so excited to see you playing phasmo again
I love how when Bob doesn’t get his *In Space With* reference, Mark’s heart fully shatters in front of our eyes
"You need to be quiet when the ghost is hunting, don't talk, don't do anything"  Mark: *screams a top of his lungs when the ghost is hunting*
i dont get the reference guys, am i dumb?
FINALLY THANK U SO MUCH MARKIPLIER UR THE BEDT YOUTUBER EVER I LITERALLY REQUESTED THIS ON PREVIOUS VIDEOS
OMFG i loved the old phasmaphobia videos and i got so excited when i saw this
I'm a BALLAAH, SO it's PHANTASM
pleaseeeee keep making phasmophobia vids i love themmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Wait how long has it been since mark did phasmaphobia
Yeah I alway love it when there's a new video with Bob and Wade !
I Was just playing phasmo waited a long time for this, i started playing bcs of mark
So happy to finally have more of Mark's fantastic content!
I have been waiting for more of Phasmophobia with you, Bob and Wade.
I love these Phasmophobia videos with you and the boys. please do more
Wade: He might be dead Mark: He's probably fine *opens door to find Bob dead on the floor next to cursed mirror*  Guys I don't think he's fine. I think he's dead
Anyone else than me who got jumpscared by the moon😂
Definitely one of my favorite series y'all do hahaha
I miss this series so much haha
Was it just me or was that ghost's jumpscare from the start more like a sneeze on steroids
ive watched the phasmophobia videos probably ten times each this was for me... ill watch them hundreds more
yay shesh
Haha I love you three when you play together! This game has so many new exciting updates, can't wait to see more.
You should do portal 2 coop
I zoned out for a second and that moon jumpscare really got me
in space
Yay! More Phasmaphobia!
This is my favourite game!!!!!
I honestly JUST rewatched all the old Phasmaphobia TODAY, the heck!!
I’ve been waiting so long for this magic to return … and now, it’s finally back
plasmaformer with breast and wage
I CLICKED SO FAST
I literally love this game ❤️❤️
IM SO SORRY IM LATE I LOVE UR VIDEOS (i think im obsessed)
bro,, you have no idea how MUCH i've waited for more phasmophobia.. LOVE IT.
There’s a slender man Easter egg
Distractible gang, playing games!
30:25 nice reference
Lets goooo! I've been waiting for you guys to get together and play this game again! I hope you like the changes
Wooh! I love Phasmophobia! I’m so happy for consistent videos!
So glad they're back at phas, although I kinda miss the original vids where they were new and scared 😂
"IM ABOUT TO DIE"  *proceeds to stand in the doorway*
Whenever Mark uploads it's an amazing day when Bob and wade join the day is perfect
I had the overwhelming feeling that I had watched this video before. Its because I watched Bobs video too lol. 😅 I never claimed to be smart!
Space was amazing but I am ecstatic that mark is back to playing games again
The game is way harder than it used to be with far more complex mechanics and elements. My friends and I stopped playing it regularly because of the difficulty and stress of the game. I think I can play 3 or 4 round before it's just too much stress to keep playing (I don't play horror normally)
can someone name the reference, i cant seem to remember the show's name 24:47
Renowned ghost hunter Wade, Scaredy cat Mark, and Abominable Bob make the best ghost hunting team
I LOVE BEING HERE SO EARLY ❤️❤️
Hey I was wondering if you and some friends could possibly play 7 days to die ????
I have been waiting for so long for this series to continue
I'll never get bored of watching the same kind of video x3, when it's Mark, Bob & Wade playing a game together and watching each of their POV. Especially when it's Phasmophobia 😄😄
Cant wait for the series "i solo this game" of mark in phasmophobia.
Thanks for the amount of content Mark, i've missed this!
Fantastic intro 😂
God someone never Give Mark a deck of many things. That drawing many cards, horror flashbacks of Dungeons and dragons.
THE BOYS ARE BACK
Yes! I wanted mark to play this again! Yes!💖💖💖
fun fact: lixian is the one who gives life to this.
Starting at 32:05 might be the greatest audio sequence I've ever heard in my life.
How he draw the whole deck and be the last to die😂?
I was like „oh! Mark played Phasmo!“ and only now realised that this video is literally brand new
yay more mark phasmo

Hello :]
I've been waiting for this day to come and its finally here
aaaaa missed these vids so badd
Never thought this will come back, I'm so excited!!!!
YESSSSSS
I was actually missing this so much I went back and watched the old ones
I'd really love seeing Mark play ghost exorcism Inc.
Weirdly enough, there's a found footage horror film called Demon's (I think) that goes about the same as this video.
Nice seeing this game back, I remember when I had decided to check out this series.
LETS GOO I LOVE IT WHEN YOU PLAY THIS GAME  thank you for making another phasmo video <3
Are intros still a thing? Mark: Epic intro!
but still good vid
i waited for the moment that this video would be posted, i watched it two days ago of wades channel
The second ghost gave me distractible flashbacks.
If there going to the campsite I hope they don’t forget the buddy system
Nothing much to say just stay amazing mark~
Is Mark planning on making another "Something with Markiplier" based around camping? I would love to see that. Good luck Mark with 'making smores'.
Why was Wade getting casted this episode'
I missed this
i aint afraid of no ghost mark-AJSBNRFSLKFBLKSFBKUJBVALUKJBVALKFB wade-bends over twards the windo bob-being bob
im almost level 2000 on phasi
E
*_UTTER ENJOYMENT_*
The 2nd hunt sections is just a test for Distractible Only Fans.
im so excited for the chaos to come
You guys have to play SCP containment breach multiplayer together, I'd love to see Bob and Wade stumbling around confused and scared and Mark just baby sitting them while trying to speedrun the game lol
yES!! I've been waiting for more phasmophobia with you guys this is one of my favorite series!!!
this is a terrible game for someone who is incapable of being quiet
PLEASE KEEP THIS SERIES GOING also you should turn you brightness up to 1.5 it makes your game look so much better
Man I have missed the 3 of you
HE'S BACK :')
More? Please?
"Big nice circle on hantu" Wait... the boobie ghost?
Markis just out here casually drawing the 2 rarest cards in the tarro deck, but getting a fool both times
i’m really glad phasmaphobia was brought back, it’s my favorite comfort thing to binge
Is there a vod of this?
Wow mark has really been rapid firing videos
oh my goodness... hes back on phazzle dazzle... glorious
I missed those, it was so much fun once again!
Bob with the cursed object absolute killed me 😭😭
Why can I here mare and wade in the left ear but Bob in the other
Bob probably would of came back alive if mark didnt go throught the tarrot cards durning the hunt lol.
PHASMOPHOBIA IS BACK!!!
Keep making these
Bro don’t stop making these they were some of my favorites
thank god mark posted somthing we want to see for a change
LEEEEEETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
I so happy that he did this again
I was actually just wondering last night while watching some of the FNaF revisited if you were gonna do any more phasmophobia since its seen some updates. I was so excited to see this today! 😁
It's nice to see the general longetivity Phasmophobia has had by making good updates and expanding upon the original game. Here's to more in the future so we can have the ultimate ghost hunting game to dick around in!
I- I DIDNT GET A NOTIFICATION FOR THIS??? WH
seen it three times on each channel and it's always funnier
25:45 Aeiou
Mark:Lxian turn the moon into a jumpscare Me:we talking fnaf moon? *jumpscare* Me: unholy ************ they got me
Just finished the poppy playtime stream that took place at midnight for me, thought I had nothing else to watch when I saw this. Very cool.
Mark please play more phasmophobia
At 8:22, I guess you could say he….”Face Planted.” P.P
wade needs to get help.
Man I missed seeing the 3 of them playing horror games with each other.
4:30 "I'm gonna place some cameras inside."   Proceeds to carry just the tripod. Without the actual camera
Mark: if I'm going to die start throwing things at me Bob and Wade starts throwing things Mark: That must be a good sign
And we’re back oh how I’ve missed this game
I really hope they play this more as it updates. They should try it vr mode lol
Wait bob still alive I thought he died
Just casually saw this on my feed and it took me a bit too long to realize this was recent, even after taking a look at the comments… man my brain is fried as hell
can u, the one and only markiplier, please play risk of rain 2 again. (it got DLC)
Use temperature to find the ghost room. It's the easiest way. Like to see
that was an intro i can verify
I am So ready-  The playlist from the last time they played Phasmo has been my Comfort watch for about 6 months during the Pandemic XD  I hope this is one of a few more!!
was just watching the fall guys videos w wade n bob 🫶 perfect timing
420th comment
When the first ghost is just one letter away from being named Boris Johnson and they call him a 'cougar' ghost 😭
Hi mark How’s your day going today
E
E

YES THEY RETURNED! MY DREAMS HAVE FINALLY COME TRUE!
Finally! Phasmophobia!
Bob holding the miror, it breaking, the door slamming shut, and then the door opening to reveal Bob dead was the funniest thing I have seen all day
I love the videos you do with Bob and Wade. We need more of them! 😛
Yess I love this series!!
where was this streamed?
More Phasmophobia!!! Let's go bois!
Epic moon editing❤❤(correction epic all editing)
missed this!
Me, after watching a video about r*ligious tr*ama: Ah yes phasmaphobia
God it's been so long since I've seen these three knuckleheads play games together. I'm always down for some chaos from the Three Peens.
YEAYYYYY EXCITEDDD
The gang is back-a-huntin!
Wade is 1300 levels higher than one of the previous videos
You really just drop like 10 hours of content in 24 hours, and you immediately continue to push out even more?? I can't catch up with this, that will take weeks
When was this streamed
I’m so glad you guys are playing this game again!
I am early!!!
Wow 64k
Hiiii
Yooooooo
The video we’ve been waiting for
Rogue legacy 2 released
Bob and wade Bob and weave

Hey Mark!👋😃 Glad Ur playing phasmophobia again!
On this episode of Phasmophobia: Bob dies and that’s when Mark and Wade decide to start taking it serious
Nice to see Mark, Wub, and of course the infamous Burt together again.        Pop 'er in reverse.
The way I let out a screech of victory seeing this in my feed!!
WADEEEE!!!! You rotten bastard! I fucking hate you! I jumped out of my chair and almost landed on my desk!! That was right in my ear!

Yes!! I was hoping you’d pick this up again someday!
YEEESSS. I was hoping for this. Now get jack as well.
The gang is back with Phasmophobia. I missed this series, it was so funny!
One word, YES
I've missed Phasmophobia with these theee
*not supposed to talk while it’s hunting, talks even louder when it’s hunting*
YAY
hell ye
Omg wade killing himself to save mark from Marks perspective is amazing
Is there a ghost name Jim
man i JUST rewatched the first episodes, and now this??

29:45 sweet memories

Yayyy Finally!! Gangs back to horror.
Get jack back, it’s cool to see you all guys play games together and phasmophobia is a effect game for it
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Nice
Idk why but  6:07 sounded like what Amber Heard would say that Johnny did it
WHAAAAT!? Yay aww jacks not here fuucuuck
Amazing series! So glad to see another video on this!
The series we all wanted back but never asked for
This is just what I’m needed! Love all your uploads but when the teams together it’s soo much better!!!!
E
Tarot cards leads to experiences many would consider unnatural.
Mark
is this an old video. Because mark has long hair
I recently just got into this game and I love it!
Should've expected that Goddamn moon from MM 🤦
YES so much new content
mark:level 1536.                                      insym: those peasants
please play more of this mark i love this series
Nice.
I hope they play a lot more of this one definitely one of my favorites!
I mussed watching the new phasmophobia videos so glad to see another one
11:06 Wade jumping in front of Mark to take the Ghost’s attack is both nice and evil at the same time. _You’re on your own, good luck_
nice
Good stuff!!
He grabs the cameras cause he watches the animatronics well so he would assume he is good at cameras at this game too.  Five Nights at Freddy’s King
The Holy Trinity have returned
Petition to make this intro the intro for every future Phasmophobia video
I have so much fun when Mark uploads. Luv you mark!!!
FINALLY phasmophobia, i love this game
The intro 😂
So glad this os back
soo, mark.... there is an old familiar slender faceless friend hiding somewhere in the woods around the campground map.
Yay another episode of distractable !!!
Poppy Playtime, Stanley Parable and then Phasmophobia?! Mark is SPOILING us!
Gonna ruin the 666 comments but God am I glad they're playing this again.
YAY I’ve missed this
ITS FINALLY BACK!
I have been waiting so long for you to finally play the updated version! I hope you guys can get another game with Sean sometime too!
The funniest thing about these videos is when you see it from other people's channel, you can hear Mark screaming when he's left with a ghost xD
it's been a while since mark did phasmophobia. nice.
Ghosts really don't like Bob 😭
Man if mark didnt draw during the hunt he coulda brought bob back
I take it this is an old video. But just now uploaded? I just noticed his hair is still long.
The game: "This is an update." Mark: "Dear god." The game: "There's more coming soon." Mark: "No..."
Daily uploads lets goooooooo!
13:25 no biches?
I legitimately jumped at the moon jumpscare. bruh
OH, how I’ve missed this!! Why can’t these types of videos happen more often?
That moon jumpscare really got me geez
I was about to sleep cuz it's 4am and then i've check my YT Boom... No sleeping tonight bois
Bob: Is this a joke... AAAHHH JESUS😂
That skeleton falling was probably the funniest part of the video  Probably because my humor is stupid as heck
Mark; lvl 25 Bob; lvl 65  Wade; *lvl 1536* ????
8:50 He got two of the rarest cards in the game - the High Priestess, a 2% chance card that revives a dead player, and the Hanged Man, a 1% chance card that instantly kills the player.  Just your typical Markiplier luck
my new fav intro: WELCOME TO BeAUHF 💥BUEaHF 💥bUAEHF 💥PHASMAPHOBIA🔥✨
Sorry for breaking the 69 comment number.  Btw love you mark keep it up! I watch al  your videos and listen to distractible every day twice. Also love bob and wade:) have a good night 😄
You have no idea how long i was waiting for this!!! Mark you poopy head! I missed this game with you guys so much i still rewatch the other ones over and over. 😭😭😭
hantu is "ghost" in malay. good to see the developers include everything in their game 💙
the day after i binged the other videos, perfect timing lmao
My man Mark drew both a High Priestess and a Hanged man in the same deck, on his first game since the update might we add. Shame it was during a hunt
Oh, that's a nice detail, at 12:20 when the camera starts glitching, you can actually see the ghost crawling toward mark.
The funniest most chaotic trio to ever exist ❤
I missed multiplier phasmaphobia
This game needs to hurry up and hit consoles!
It’s the hantu tek tek from distractable in the second mission
Wade throwing himself in front of the ghost so that Mark was alone had me wheezing!
I guess we know who wade ids caus r of his level lol
Mark please play a plague tale innocence
Mark should play more power wash simulator
It has been such a long time since I've seen them play Phasmo. Welcome back!
680th
I literally was just about to rewatch the first episode because I missed this series
😂
8:50 I'm sorry, it has to be done.... *BIG INHALE* IS THAT A JOJO REFRENCE???
Yes finally
the death cup!
Pls play more
i was waiting for so long for this. Please Mark do a vr episode
Pog
I’ve watched the two other perspectives I’ve been WAITING for this ❤️❤️❤️
Please give ghost exile a try. Alot more Jumpscares and harder ghosts
sam and colby be like 10:03😂😂😂
I just want you to remember that we are in a giant rock, in space, with markplier... just let that thought sink into your mind
THE HOLY TRINITY. THE GOLDEN TRIO. RETURN OF THE KINGS.
It's back!!!! I've missed watching you play phas!
If Bob “ran” he would become a ghost instantly.  Fat body.
“Your on your own now” *laughing* *wade straight up dies* “OH GOD”
Yeeeesss the infamous ghost hunters are BACK YET AGAIN! :DD
I👏Missed👏This👏
Dang marks been on the grind after in space with markiplier finished.
Wow, there have been alot of updates to that game. Hope we get to see more now that there are a million updates! :)
I’ve been really depressed lately and mark uploading daily has really made me feel happy :))
YEAHHHHH PHASMO IS BACK
Mark pulling the Death card and yelling “I got bad news!” had me absolutely wheezing 😂
Holy shit.. it's been a while since I seen mark on here.
Shawn's not here as per usual. Why? Because he is too busy making funniest TikTok videos he found .. he became such a looser lately.
Why didn't YouTube give me a notif for this 😐
Can't wait for Mark to post an entire video where there are no jumpscares whatsoever except for Lixian's editing with Mark's sound effects
Please keep the intro for this game as you did it here
"it will hear you"  mark : SCREAMING HE IS ABOUT TO DIE
I would of recommended to play after this next patch lol It’s looking crazier and crazier with each dev update.  The game is in a good state but the custom difficulty will allow me to have something harder than nightmare with the restrictions I approve of. I still hate the Nightmare mode only allowing 2 evidence. It’s fun and all guessing but not getting it right is also frustrating when you don’t play the game constantly enough to know the ghost by taste, sound and feel lmao
"I'm gonna sell this" my immature humor is at its peak right now with how many dirty jokes there are in this phasmaphobia episode
FINALLYYYY
OH MAN! THEYRE AT IT AGAIN!
YES
We got Majora's Mask!
reactions to Wade's power level never get old
We all got your back whenever mark
YESSSS ANOTHER GAME PLAYYYYYYYY
This vid has 360° audio and with headphones its very trippy
The 'lead the way by throwing cups' was cool and made me wish I had friends in the spirit realm just so I could ask them to throw cups at me when I'm about to get in some mess.
1500 lvl who dont even tell them about electronic T_T
Return of the king
11:00 This whole sequence was so funny the music stopping and them saying "no me" and Wade choking himself
Everyone do yourself a favor and watch this on Bobs channel it’s hilarious from his POV
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
Hell yeah! I love you guys play games together
epic!!
Best game yall play together
One of my most favorite series from Mark
When did they add so many ghost types??
Wth! Mark blessing us with all this awesome long content!!
Oh man
the boys are back!
Oh thank god. I was afraid of that mark was going to change. Those revisites and space with Markiplier think really annoyed me. Im not trying to discourage or insult his work about space but i don't like that he showed that space think to our face such a forced way and use fnaf videos as a tool for that. The think that i most hate is when people beg me or try to manipulate me just to show something that i'm not interested. I never cared about 'space show' and i'm glad that Mark started to uploads normal videos without talking that damn space.
I was seriously re-watching their other phasmaphobia videos last night! This was a nice surprise to get another ep!
This group needs to play Occult
25:46 john madden. John madden. ahhhhhhh. au au au au au
the first game is the PERFECT example of what not to do in phasmo, want to get good? just watch that and do the exact opposite of what literally everyone did
hi mark
Yesss the boys are back playing Phasmo!
YEEEEEEEES ANOTHER ONNNNNEEEEE
Within 1 hour, did I spy with my little eye this here video. Glorious do it be.
Didn’t know this featured Burt and Wug from Space. Cool!
Omg I was waiting FOREVER for more of this game 😭
ayy phasmophobia's back!
I cant believe Markipliers pet named Steve was a skeleton in a closet all along.
OMG I WAS HOPING YOU'D PLAY THIS AGAIN!!! also more updates are coming soon... 😁
aeiou
Oh My God, this doofus just pulled a 2% high priestess in the middle of a hunt...
oh mah god please mark bob and wade keep playing phas together it was so much damn fun watching you goofballs play this game
also our hair is the same
MY FAVORITE SERIESSSS
Epic
rewatched this series literally last night. Nice to see them ghost hunting again.
omg so glad to see this game again
How many hours does wade have
I was so excited to see Bob and Wade's videos knowing that Mark would eventually post as well! I've missed phasmaphobia!
Mark was so sad when bob didn’t get his reference
What about "I'm on Observation Duty"?
Finally he plays a video game
Cut the yellow wire. Do it.
lets go mark, burt and wug playing together:)
I watched bob’s play through and was really excited when mark told Lixian to add jump scares to the pics and he did not disappoint
bitch i can make orange ryme with bannana, oranana
It’s so hard to watch them when I watch Insym😂
In the last 24 hours we've gotten how many hours of content?  That must have been some break
Man mark has to try this in vr
* BRRR NEW PHASMOPHOBIA VIDEO * AUTISM BRAIN GO BRR
When I finally can say I know a game, how it works, and what to do to kill my friends. :D
OMG I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
try tp play with insym he is amazing at this game!!
Wow I’ve literally been binge watching all your phasmo vids and as soon as I’m done you upload this
I missed watching you play Phasmophobia together. This game and GTFO are definitely my favourites
This was the game that made me discover Mark's channel. I may be in tears rn
Glad you are playing again, bought the game a while back, love it.
What is the rates of me writing my essay while listening to a playlist of mark playing phasmophobia today and with a new video today.
I’m so glad they’ve learned from their mistakes since they’ve last played this game. Lol still funny though to watch them scream
This game is fucking masterpiece with 3 or more players
the scares are back, phatomasomia
You should play In Sound Mind🌸💗🌸
You should check out Bugsnacks 🌸💗🌸 It is a great game with amazing characters and it is full of mysterys to solve. You will love playing it🌸💗🌸
You should play Rakuen🌸💗🌸 It is a beautiful and heartwarming story set in Japan. 🌸💗🌸 You would love it. 🌸💗🌸
love watching them play this because of the fear they feel
You ever plan to go back to Voidtrain Mark? That game is very entertaining to watch and I'd love to see more of you and the boys on it❤️
mark i love you and i love this game try it in vr next time lol
Perfect intro lmao
My worst fear
😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞😞
I was literally talking about how i missed phasmophobia yesterday-
If there’s something strange in your neighborhood who you gonna call? Definitely not mark bob and wade
THE 3 POONS IN A POP!!...     Wait a minute did i say that right?
I’m so glad he’s back in full swing, especially with horror game vids and vids with Bob and wade, those are my favorite types
we are back to the iconic trio!
I've waited for another phasmaphobia video for so long and it's finally here :D
Lmao!!! That's a keeper photo 👏 😄
Now this is peak markiplier content at it's best
Glad you guys are back to this game, really entertaining series
oh hell yeah ive been getting back into this game and with mark uploading a new video on it, there should be some more active people online for the next few days.
you can now say to the ghosts hi and they say leave or die
I was literally watching their older videos, and I went out, and there this video was! I’m so happy!
Right when I was listening to the playlist :)
I remember when I first played this update with my friend he drew death on the cards and killed me-
I missed watching them playing this game and losing their minds
Did anybody else get pleasant flashbacks to Dungeon Nightmares and pressing B to Blow for Boney when Wade let the skeleton out of the locker? Good times. Good memories. What even was that: 2014 or 2015, I think?
YES MARK PLAY THIS MORE
Yes, more Distractible in a different form?  I'll take it.
I love that Mark drew the one card that could bring Bob back to life, but because the Ghost was hunting,  it changed to the Fool.
Glad to have you back mark! I hope you got plenty of rest!
When is this from? Mark has long hair
earliest i’ve ever been to a markiplier video
Finally! It feels as though I’ve been waiting 500 years for another Phasmophobia video
Hi
back at it again with phasmophobia and we love to see it
dude I love this game upload more with it
I'm going to assume Mark has no idea how close he was to death at 9:09
aaay lets gooo!!!
Let's goooo
I've been waiting for this
The fucking moon bit actually scared the shit out of me. I had the volume up and was leaning forward. Holy shit...Great job on that one Lixian!
I just thought about how much I would enjoy another phasmo video with these guy and just like that, here it is :D
Lixian make Mark a jumpscare!
Oh my gosh I’ve been WAITING for this for over a YEAR this is so exciting
I missed this so much. It’s great to see him come back to this game when there’s been so many new updates.
I’m soo glad you guys have started playing this again! Really hoping for some more uploads on this again :)
PHASMOPHOBIA IS BACK!! god I love this series sm
I waited for this one
Man, I love it when they get together and play games
Great to see this again!
Wow it's way more scarier then before but Mark waid and Bob just make it comedy
Thank you wade for making them look at the door lol
I’m so glad they’re playing this game again I can’t wait to see all the new stuff
markiplier I know you probably won't see this but I just wanted to say hi if you do see this it will mean so much if you replied
Wade needs a break from this game by the looks of it
yayyyy i missed this!
ITS HEREEEEEEEE
Finally, it's back
I swear, the writing of jinn in the journal made me think it’s name was JIM!  JIM is everywhere now, those clones must’ve been spread to all multiverses.
Yesss they r back....  More of theseee plzzzz!!!!
My friends and I also make “John Madden” and “AEIOU AEIOU AEIOU” jokes during Phasmo 😂 I’m sorry Bob and Wade didn’t join you in the joke
“Where are yooooou?” Me: and I’m so sorry! 😂
No way, i was re watching the old Phasmophobia videos yesterday, and now this!? Sweet!
"Howdy camper" 👀
Im excited for this! ^^ hope yall have a good day <3
I missed the videos with lixian editing
Lixians Moon jumpscare actually scared me lol.
Bob: (draws a card from a deck of cursed cards and dies) Mark: Ooh look! Some cards on the floor. (starts drawing multiple cards)
I will always love this match up. The 3 of them always make the day better.
let's goo
Please make the laxative Olympics a real thing with Ethan
Mark play silent hill downpour
You should check out Walk 散歩. I think you'd really like its style and jumpscares :D
I dont have time to live anymore!!! Chill dude!! Too much i cant please     Where is my mom   Help

Wow, thanks for not giving me the notification for this video Youtube!
More phasmophobia pls
"No, me. That's right you're on your own now, mark" I'm not sure if that was a noble sacrifice or a total dick move.
Mark has been releasing so many videos. Loving the consistency!
Mark should do another episode of this, but get Jack to join
Awh hell yeah it’s back!
i just found out that my cat died last night.
Ok that was perfect timing I was watching the old phasmaphobia videos an hour ago 😂
I missed you guys playing this game! glad it’s back
Jesus christ look at Wade's level

So moon jump scare got me…..I hate you Lixian 🌚🌝

Love when you guys just start abandoning eachother in a panic  Edit: also wanted to add that i was in jury duty waiting to start when i watched this and had to cough and clear my throat several times to hide my laughing in the dead silence of the waiting room…

Mark you can put the camera on the tripod then pick up the tripod with the camera attached which saves you an item slot. \
Holy crap you upload fast

Mark thank you for keeping the Siri strong
Could you another with Jack as well? That would be so good as the many times he and this group create chaos
10:53 never thought id be scared by a coffee cup

the tower is 10x scarier than death i got so much more nervous after that draw
spook time with markimoo
Hey mark play wwe 2k battlegrounds with bob and wade on pc or any other console.
Yess I love this game when you play it
Mark just kept telling his editor to make things jump scares 3":
I love your videos. I just wanted to say thank you for always making such amazing videos and putting such time into your content.
You guys make my day ty
Lol love this game. Another one to try is ghost exiles it's new but it's got some good jump scares.
I like when they release their different points of view for the games that they play. It's hilarious to watch their expressions!
finally more phasmaphobia ^^ love seeing wade at 1536 lol
Omggg I’ve been waiting for this
Irh5ä
Finally! I've been waiting for new markiplier phasmophobia!
Even warned, that moon scared the crap out of me.
I was just thinking, "Hm, when will Mark play phasmophobia again?"  2 hours later... this 😂
I love how you can tell whether video was ready for some time or it's fresh just by looking at Mark's hair lol
Finally the real game begins ❤️
Great new content with Bob and Wade, love to see it... Hope for more.
I missed this so much!! Im glad he plays it again :)
Oh, hi Mark!
I watched old video's of you playing phas yesterday and now theres a new video about it truly a perfect timing
yagga
Yey finally! I've been waiting for this for so long!!
@markiplier 有這麼多視頻嗎hähhh 感到困惑
Would love to see Mark play The Advisor. It's like a mix between personality test and RPG.
I never realized how crucial a coffee cup was when hunting for ghosts.
Number 342 Les go, 342 rounds up to number #1 So Markiplier You Should Notice me. ;-; pls?
Oh yes. I would have watched a dozen more episodes of the original run. I hope these doofuses go hog wild on this.
Super glad that we get more Phasmophobia with these three!!!
I love when Markiplier plays multiplayer games. It's absolutely hilarious. The iq of the room goes down when they get together, but the laughs go up
Oh my god yes, finally more coops on youtube
I really missed just some good old peens in a pod videos
missed these idiots, Phasmaphobia is such a good game for them to play
I'm finally early. I want to say that you are loved and appreciated and wonderful never forget that
I'd been having a really bad day, and just hearing your voices and seeing you together again made me so happy I started crying thanks guys 😊
Thankyou Mark:)
YES YES YES YES! You play it again! I was waiting for phasmophobia with great squad
Mark: So many updates!  Me knowing a new update is coming soon: There is another.
Huh perfect timing i just got outta school
suffering...great
I usually don't jump from jumpscares but that sound from the door literally did it for me XD
YES they returned to phasmo. I really love this series
YO!? Phasmophobia? let's go!
Getting near that door was the first thing my friend made me do after I bought the game. The worst thing was that I bought the game in the Halloween Update/Event.
FINALLY MARKIMOO IS BACK ON PHASMO
8:53 it hurts my phasmo soul XD. Its such a rare card too! Ah well, that's what happens when you keep drawing cards during a hunt; you get the fool
the boys are back
RUN JIM, THERE BE DEMONS JIM
2 views????

I played a scary game a little bit ago, and got scared, stood up, and verbally spammed no as I walked to go cry in the bathroom. So, I feel for bob lol.

When one of the character models looks like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory
Three markiplier vids in a day? looks like I won’t be sleeping
E

Was hoping you'd check it out again, been wanting to see the updates Edit: mark drawing 70 cards after getting Death is icing on this cake
cool if i do say so myself
Absolutely stunning intro! I couldn’t even believe that it was all just effects!
You need to update Wade's thumbnail.
I really wish Mark could finish Powerwash Simulator Edit: Anyone agrees??
I Still Waiting For PropHunt... I Still Believe...

YAAAAAASSSSS! PHAAAAAASSSSSS!!!!
276th comment mark :D (I love distractable I’ve listened to candy uncle 13 times) Love your content all your videos anything regarding you because your funny and just downright awesome
Watching their gameplay on each of their perspective is just so funny cuz of how there’s a comedic effect not seeing the other two’s faces
Bob: where are you ghost???  Me:I’m right here!!!
YYYYYYEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS
Glad to see they're back to this game, I enjoyed watching them play this.
Love that this series has come back!

YES, I missed you guys playing this game
Even though it's 1 am here but still I'll watch this
Definitely a good game for horror fans
yesssssssirrrrrrrrr
i love how mark gets jumpscared that easy
YAY another phasmo vid and i love them so much!!
2:27 "I will let Bob lead the way"  says Wade who has highest level 1536 compared to Bob's 64
Mark my man I havent even finished watching the stanely parable video. When he said he was back he meant he was BACK. I love it.
Ah I have been waiting for this! Love it when you 3 play this game
I'd been having a really bad day, and just hearing your voices and seeing you together again made me so happy I started crying thanks guys 😊
It pains me to see him drain the cards during a hunt
This series was very fun to watch and I was upset when the uploads on Phasmophobia started slowing down
Finally i have waited for this moment
Hey Mark, not sure if you have an oculus or not but you should try playing Jurrasic world aftermath, be cool since the new movie comes out soon too. Its an incredibly fun game and it can be quite scary sometimes
Ah Yes A New Episode Of Distractable
Collabs!!!
Literally was just feeling depressed and saw this when “distract scrolling”… thank goodness
“This is the intro, Welcome to boom boom boom, Phasmophobia
I missed phasmophobia, I hope they play it more often
I'm a arbys cook and as standard practice I will lay on the ground and lay the beef across my face and snuff as hard as possible before placing them gently on the arbys sandwich before you eat I check for quality I am quality control and have a food handlers lisnen
Its great to have Mark back at it again!
Wooo
Can we get a Conrad Stevenson's paranormal P.I.
YESSSSS, maybe voidtrain will make a comeback as well!!
I just need a new Powerwash Simulator video and all will be right with the world. I've missed these so much ;-;
I just finished watching all the videos of you guys playing Phasmophobia together, definitely one of my fav games you three played.
Finally after seeing this on bob and wades channel it’s here!
YESSSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOO
YEAHH I love this game
I’m so phobia of those phasmos
2:28 is basically skill based matchmaking in a nutshell
Love you guys and your podcast Distractable its hilarious!
My favourite series they have ever done, i am incredibly exited
Finally, the game return we’ve all been waiting for
The video hasn’t even been out long enough to watch it fully why you commenting
Oh my gosh so excited to watch! Perfect day off because of this!!!
Oh yes after long time these ghost hunters are back!!! I'm happy to see you guys. I love Phasmophobia played by you.

The chaos always escalates when Mark is with Bob and Wade and I'm here for it!

It’ll be nice to see this from Mark’s view finally.
I just finished watching the poppy the playtime vid and now this GOSH darn it. I have no other life so doesn’t matter.
"How many boos" "4-5 boos" "Oh ma gad that's a lot of boos!"
