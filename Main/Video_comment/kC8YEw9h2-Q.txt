I'm not "scared of love" anymore, I should have never let you go last year without you knowing how i feel/felt. But the is, I was scared. I was scared because I knew deep down I wasn't ready. But this time. I've finally "Got It Right" and I known that we're destined to be together. I know thst we'll be together and until then, I'll be patiently waiting. I love so much J ❤❤❤

What’s your number ? You been crossing my mind?
Hmm  I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been living so wrong, but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong, but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids are catching some flight  They're getting older I never wanted them to know how it feel To come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong  Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention And I said, "It was the look on my mama face when I did it" But really, it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions  What's the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got the millions for real Seven in the morning, my shit buzzing and banging All day my phone ring ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get 'em some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and ain't no favor  If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes, I need someone to talk to Sometimes, this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they're doing  I'm cooling, most days I just be cooling Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart, forever open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though, I be so caught up on the grind  Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me

This time last year I was over a year sober and pregnant with my partner/best friend. I would play this so loud and he would sing with me. We lost our baby about a month later. I lost my partner to his mind. I'm still here with my cat and I am broken in half but one day I will write an epic poem about this. I love you all and please keep on going. We need you. Rest In Peace Blueberry 🫐❤

Lyrics-  I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been living so wrong, but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong, but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids are catching some flight They're getting older I never wanted them to know how it feel To come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention And I said, "It was the look on my mama face when I did it" But really, it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions What's the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got the millions for real Seven in the morning, my shit buzzing and banging All day my phone ring ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get 'em some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes, I need someone to talk to Sometimes, this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they're doing I'm cooling, most days I just be cooling Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart, forever open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though, I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me
Rod wave music be hitting different when you get out of a relationship shit be deep😭🔥

“What’s the point of a instagram image when you got millions for real” 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
It is a good day rod
Rod we need a song with you and Fridayy that's another certified hit!!!
It is very good music. Keep it up!
nice song
I really love how he sang it  and the message of the song.  ❤
@thecruptoholicscorner
Do anyone realize Rod wave is crying out for help or is it always about everyone else and how they benefit from his music or better yet how meaningful his music is.

Yes sir  cosin  I love you
I love this song so much!
I feel like I love this song! This song reminds me of me that I have to call my friends! This gotta be the best song of 2023 since Bad Habits by Steve Lacy & Just Wanna Rock by Lil Uzi Vert!
Waiting on that rod wave and Mozzy collab
I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been livin' so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They gettin' older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions Whats the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the mornin', my shit buzzin' and bangin' All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doin'  [Chorus] I'm coolin', most days I just be coolin' Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me
I know how he feels I can relate to his song. I care everyone to see how they're doing checking on them to see if everything is alright telling everyone I love them worrying stressing and at the same time I'm saying to myself I wish that they would call me and say and do the same exact thing I'm doing for them and to them then I say you no what don't stop doing what you're doing continue to be you at same time start think about yourself take a look in the mirror and say all those things you say to others start saying it to yourself. That was a nice song
dont even know why I got it really hate the attention!!!!
You are  my god
This my favorite song on repeat
rs
That man be speaking that shit and he know it too😂❤
He's way better than drake, i love everything rodwave puts out!💯

God loves you  remember that  he loves you so much that he sent his son to die on the cross for our sins. I know break ups are so devastating especially when you felt so happy with them, but know they are gone probably already in another relationship smiling with the other person. But be of good cheer because GOD WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU.💯
Love you rod

I spent 3 months away  from my friends  trying  to get that dou then try come bk to spent couple g with them but they trun me down b4 I said a word #life
Understand every lyric
Mm, I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been livin' so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They gettin' older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions Whats the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the mornin', my shit buzzin' and bangin' All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doin' I'm coolin', most days I just be coolin' Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me

Happy birthday🎉 rod waveeee🎉❤
Beautiful song.......Rod Wave you did it as usual.
Verse] Mm, I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been livin' so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They gettin' older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions Whats the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the mornin', my shit buzzin' and bangin' All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doin'
I love you Rod Wave ❤
I'm finna cry 😭

The song itself carries a deep message about the importance of cherishing our friendships and valuing the people who are there for us through thick and thin. It serves as a reminder to reach out, connect, and show appreciation to those who have supported us along our journey.
OMG OMG OMG ROD WAVEEEEEEEEEEE
Rod Wave is one of my favorites musical artist. He has an amazing voice and add a great flow, sweet beats and a message that follows along and it's hard for him to make just meh song. Lol!  As the years go on a song like this definitely radiates much louder. Friends are busy with there lives just like your busy with well yours. Family isn't around as much and soon if your not with a significant other or have a kid it's just you and yourself and that's it. I'm cool with that most of the time but it does get hard. I feel like I'm bothering friends if I wanna reconnect and I've been told by family that when I visit I talk too much. It's true I do. I have lots to say and being by myself  is hard. Life is hard and making a living is hard. Every just gets fucking harder and when your feeling like shit and can't even manage a conversation without angering someone it's just tough. Every year I tell myself it'll get easier or better and it doesn't. I don't have it as bad as the next guy but just idk. I just keep going and doing the best I can. It's all I can do...
I love you brother 💪💪✌✌✌
Rod wave ❤❤❤❤
I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home ... my fault guess I did it all wrong.
this is tuff rod but when are you going to drop the hs freestyle and make it a full song 😣😣
I still listen to poison 😭 all his music never gets old ESPECIALLY Already Won Rod rode tf out that can you stand the rain sample

2 days later Already know the words lol😅
W ROD FR HE NEVER MISSES !!!
I keep pretending like I can love again when its all lust & sex. Im living in a fake moment of life right now because deep down I am heartbroken. From mistakes making life turn left to my love life being stuck on my first real love till this day. Im lost trying to find a purpose while at the same time trying to enjoy the ride life has in store. - words from a broken 24 year old
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I got a 6'5 redhead son who looks just like you. Never thought that would happen. Hes in the lower 48 doing utility contracting. He sings and plays music on the side. You two should meet and collaberate. In the meantime, protect yourself. When in doubt, call BDO. They are forensic accounting. 😊

it’s like i don’t know how to talk to people or put in words how im feeling so i just put on Rod Wave , it’s like he’s speaking to my heart matter of fact fuckkk da heart he’s speaking to me SOUL.  every lyric i can always relate too , due to personal things i had to change my number and the most hurtful part is nobody NOTICED still till this day im not active on no social media and to think someone would atleast check on me , that’s how you know how alone you can be but i like it dat way. It’s just me and my broken soul making it through life with Rod Wave (my husband) ❤️!!!!!

When you listening to rod wave you are listening to real life we all can relate to. No one ever calls me unless they want something. Never do they say do I need anything. Rod ain’t killin poppin pills or super duper dope deal in. Just real music your soul embraces squeezes and wishes it never had to let go. This man is like 2pac because he knows how to express what we all are feeling or have felt an he says it in a way only he can an it’s authentic original and he us going to be one of our greats. Please don’t let drugs greed or ego or bad ppl railroad his life or career. Life is messed up an it hurts but everyone is lit an the man or that bi:$h if you let them tell it but mean while broken hearts an ptsd riddle the community an only rod wave got the courage to speak on it. You the real mvp rod wave. My heart cold as ice to bro thanks to a devil of a woman named hoe

*LYRICS*   [Verse] Mm, I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been livin' so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They gettin' older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions Whats the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the mornin', my shit buzzin' and bangin' All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doin'  [Chorus] I'm coolin', most days I just be coolin' Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me
Surely he must have earned more money with crypto than with music, I agree with @TheCryptoholicsCorner, but this clip and music is very top, so I believe in this success too!

This!!!! I swear....
You have an impressive talent, I'm sure you will have many successes in your career
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Always like me a free therapy session
ma nigga ❤❤❤❤
💜 Verse 2 ending: Peep what Rod is saying. Wake up folks.  1:09- 2:07...the top does get lonely. Trust me I know. 😢 How many times does a person have to repeat "If I ever cross your mind and Please call me? So grateful for real music. 💯 He is letting whoever has his number know to please call him and let it be a sincere call. Let's laugh, reminense, and just have a normal conversation without there being an agenda. This was deep. Took me back to "Break My Heart." He is exposing some true hurt that many successful people feel. Even though they appear to have it all, their "circle of life" really does change and sometimes it's not the best feeling. Even with all the money and wealth. I loved this. Thanks Rod! Never disappoint!
GOAT
On god I love you bra
❤ he looks so happy and kids are adorable
We love you ❤

Every time I’m super sad and down , he drops a song that talks about exactly what I’m feeling … thank you rod for those who don’t got a voice or an outlet for the depression , it’s a bittersweet feeling that your music gives me and all of us as fans . Thank you from the bottom of a broken heart . agreed!

Yeah this is one of those ones 🔥
Can’t wait to vibe to the rest
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

Hit song only over here

This a HIT
1 John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Luke 13:3 - I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.  Acts 3:19 - Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;  2 Peter 3:9 - The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  Acts 2:38 - Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  Matthew 3:2 - And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.  1 Timothy 3:16 KJV And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
So, is Rod selling his fancy cars, or...?
That’s it Big Brudda 🦍
I just heard this song yes, played it till my battery die, I mean you worth it 🔥💯
1 Corinthians 6:9-12 King James Version 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,  10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.  11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.  12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
GOOOOD ROD KEEP EM COMING BOY WE LOVE YOU!
Revelation 20 King James Version 20 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.  2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,  3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.  4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.  5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.  6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.  7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,  8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.  9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.  10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.  11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.  12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.  13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.  14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.  15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
If real humans actually liked this music, then they wouldn't be using pop ups to redirect me here to generate views. You ain't making it out of the trash can with this crap.

Rod wave ur the best❤
Listen I’ve got some bad news , the Bible says everyone has fallen short of the glory of God through their sin , and the only way to pay for that sin is death, but there is also the GOOD NEWS, For God loved the world so much that he sent his only begotten Son to die on the cross, rise from the grace defeating death, and paying the price for our sins, so that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting , eternal life . Therefore I ask you brothers and sisters turn form you sinful ways and repent for tomorrow is not promised.

Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you’ll ever hear. All of us, without exception, have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). And because God is just and will not let sin go unpunished, the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). As a result, that means that as sinners, we will all get what we rightly deserve: eternal punishment, which is called the second death. But the good news is that God is loving and does not wish that any should perish but that all would come to repentance (2 Peter 3:9). So He made a way for us to be saved and now graciously offers you the free gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ (Romans 6:23), all while justice is done. He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on behalf of us and pay for our sins on a cross, and He was then buried and rose again on the third day (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Regardless of who you are or what you may have done, if you believe with your heart the gospel ( ^^ which I just mentioned above) and confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved (Romans 10:9,10). Salvation is simple and free. It’s not a 12 step program, and don’t think, as many do, that you just have to be a “good person” or do good works to go to heaven. Salvation is based on what Jesus did, not what you do (Ephesians 2:8,9). Believe in Christ, and you will be saved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever should believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through Him.” John 3:16,17
It is a beautiful song❤️

Smoke and chill
💛Lyrics💛   Verse 1: I’ve been up for 3 nights tryna plan out my life, I’ve been living so wrong but I just wanna do right, It’s like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife, Wanna pack up my clothes with my kids and catch us a flight, Theyy getting older, I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home, My fault guess I did it all wrong, Park the Rolls Truck ain’t drove that thing inna minute, I don’t even know why I bought it I really hate the attention, I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it but really it was my pride ready to say it ain’t rented, Can’t get lost in the sauce caught in money competitions, What’s the point of an instagram image when you got millions frl? You really got them millions frl.  Verse 2: Seven in the morning my shit buzzing & banging, All day my phone ring ever since i’ve been famous, Everybody got the perfect scheme to get dem some paper, Tryna make it seem it’s best for me and it ain’t no favor, If it wasn’t for favors, They a never call you, Sometimes I need someone to talk to, Sometimes this life can be confusing, Call your friends and ask how they doing, I’m cooling most days I just be cooling, Everybody got they own life and their own problems, This life’s to short for grudges..call em , To the girl who got my heart forever opened my line, To my niggas down the road one call at a time, My phone never ring to see if I’m doing fine even tho I be so caught up onna grind, Could you call me? If I ever cross your mind. Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind, Call me if ever cross your mind, Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind, Please call me.
W rod❤
you see, you really just in a different lane. Thank you

Was having a bad day at work until I saw a new rod wave song. My day just got so much better. Thank you 🙏 I needed this
Lyrics:  [Verse] I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been living so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They getting older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions Whats the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the morning, my shit buzzing and banging All day my phone ring, ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it ain't no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doing  [Chorus] I'm cooling, most days I just be cooling Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me
Bout the time
this shit so wack lol

This really made me think hard
Good bless my friends and family, May God bless rod wave
We need to lean more on God and turn away from the money chase. Your just chasing your own tail for something that’s never going to fufill you. Like he said it’s just the pride we get from other people wanting what we got. Making us feel significant but the truth is without God your a pile of beans no matter what. God will change your view to seek after bigger and better things and then give you multiple chances to get to it if he don’t carry you all the way.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
ROD 🌊 CANT BE TOUCHED 💯

[Verse] I been up for three nights tryna plan out my life I been living so wrong but I just wanna do right It's like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids and catch us a flight They getting older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault, guess I did it all wrong Park the Rolls truck, ain't drove that thing in a minute I don't even know why I bought it, really hate the attention I said it was the look on my mama face when I did it But really it was my pride, ready to say it ain't rented Can't get lost in the sauce, caught in money competitions What's the point of an Instagram image when you got millions for real? You really got them millions for real Seven in the morning, my shit buzzing and banging All day my phone ring ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it's best for me and it no favor If it wasn't for favors, they'll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life can be confusing Call your friends and ask how they doing  [Chorus] I'm cooling, most days I just be cooling Everybody got they own life and they own problems This life's too short for grudges, call 'em To the girl who got my heart forever, open my line To my niggas down the road, one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I'm doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind Could you call me if I ever cross your mind? Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Call me if I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind? If I ever cross your mind Please, call me

Sometimes life can be confusing, so call your friends 🎶
I’ve been up for 3 nights tryna plan out my life I’ve been living so wrong but I just want to do right It’s like I did her so wrong but wanted her to be my wife Wanna pack up my clothes, my kids, and catch us a flight They gettin older I never wanted them to know how it feel to come from a broken home My fault guess I did it all wrong Park the rolls truck Ain’t drive that thang in a minute Ion even know why I bought it Really hate the attention  I said it was the look on my momma face when I did it But really it was my pride ready to say it ain’t rented Can’t get lost in the sauce caught in money competitions  What’s the point of an instagram image when you got billions for real Really got them millions for real  7 in the morning my shit buzzin and banging All day my phone ring ever since I been famous Everybody got the perfect scheme to get us some paper Tryna make it seem it’s best for me and it ain’t no favor If it wasn’t for favors, they’ll never call you Sometimes I need someone to talk to Sometimes this life could be confusing Call ya friends and ask how they doing I’m coolin Most days I just be coolin Everybody got they own life and they on problems This life’s to short for grudges call em To the girl who got my heart forever open my line To my niggas down the road one call at a time My phone never ring to see if I’m doing fine Even though I be so caught up on the grind  Could you call me  If I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind If I ever cross your mind  call me  If I ever cross your mind Do I ever cross your mind If I ever cross your mind Please call me
🐐
UGHHHH YOU SO HARDDD
Bro Rod did u and Polo plan this shit dawg 😂
