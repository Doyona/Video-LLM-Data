Imagine safely handing the ball off as you were told to, and still being on the wrong side of the highlight of the year.
Derek Carr was surgical in that final drive. Man do I miss that guy!
Oakland Raiders vs the New England Jets
Raiders vs Patriots week 15 2022 bro 🫩🥀
They were all my favorite teams. Vikings, Lions, Patriots, Falcons, and Seahawks vs. Raiders.
Dam meyers been helping the raiders before he even joined them
Unnecessary roughness by Maxx Crosby? That should have nullified that touchdown
The Las Vegas Lateral
What a ending
I knew Patricia was sped, but he couldn’t possibly be THIS sped.
Hey Raiders... you can have that one to make up for the "tuck rule" game.  You're welcome.
I think the raiders team didn't like josh being the coach so the players were not giving their best
the raiders are afraid to tackle lol
I'm going to come back to this video for years haha
I love coming back to this
Has anyone noticed that this game is on FOX despite it being an AFC only matchup
Definitely makes sense for Las Vegas to bring in Jakobi Meyers for 2023. I still can't believe this play even now.
May be one of my favorite games ever.  Raiders/Patriots (2001 Tuck Rule) We'll Never Forget.  P.S. He DID tuck it.
A pretty weird way to end a game.
Tom Brady could learn a thing or two from this QB, but he's probably too busy getting a divorce.
Raiders should be able to beat New England more soundly this upcoming season.
once again patriots decide to do something stupid
Buccaneers:
Omg yes
Carr lovers just gonna act like that pick 6 didbt happen.....ok.
as a raiders fan i gotta say who threw that pick is an idiot
Although Rhamondre Steveson was under a lot of fire for that last play, he saved me in both my fantasy leagues, he won me the first round in one, and secured me a playoff berth in the other
They should of went to Overtime
Rhamondre Stevenson 19 attempts 172 rushing yards 1 rushing touchdown 22.8 Fantasy Points!
Talking about a Choking hazard
Candidate for game of the year
Fakest crap I've ever seen. WWE
My first time watching the highlights of the game. I can't believe how funny the ending was.🤣🤣💯
11:12 He just sat him down with one arm like watch tf out truckkked..this is is just to beautiful......Die Hard Raider from LA  back to Oakland 2vegasss all day still in californiaa
So much is being talked about concerning Derek Carr, well Carr wasn't the problem, that's Josh  McDaniels bullshit,  the Raiders problem is their defense period point blank
that was so crazy for some one who went to game incredible.
As a raiders fan, I know patriots fans are gonna be talking about that keelan cole touchdown saying it’s incomplete, which there might be an argument for, but for raiders and patriots fans alike old enough to remember the tuck rule, 100 of those keelan cole touchdowns would not pay off the tuck rule. Just had to be said.
Less obvious ways to fix a game
One day, we, Raiders, will be champions of the NFL.
Just like J.T. giving Russell Hantz his hidden immunity idol on Survivor, this will go down as the dumbest play in NFL history.
The house had to make sure the gamblers didn't win over them 🤣 the fix was in on this one. WWE right here
why they didn't try a kick from 50 yard last second?, they did it so good from 47 early.
WTF
8:32 Yay Jacobi you da man! 😎 11:10 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
This is also the first time the player carrying the ball in the thumbnail is on the losing team.
As a Seahawks fan, this is a revenge arc
Jesus H, that final play was fake as hell! Or is everyone else completely blind to just how fake it is?  Meyers looked right at Jones and made the scripted play, then Mac Jones took an intentional dive that would make Neymar blush. Follow that up with Bill saying Mac couldn't throw it that far so they ran it, followed by Mac throwing it that far against Bengals following week. And don't miss the glaringly intentional drop by Pats punter against Bengals, nor Bengals Irwin intentional short arm of a td just like Tyler Boyds against the chiefs a few weeks prior. The fakeness of nfl "entertainment" has been way too obvious this year. I mean just look at the Vikings, the VIKINGS!
WILD...i don't care for either team, but that crazeeee ending...bwahahahahahahahahaha pats...just fall down and go to OT
I hate the Raiders. But I hate the Patriots even more. And I live in Vermont.
Worst decision ever to throw that ball backwards
Just dumb moves pats
Я такого ещё не видел...всегда говорил что эти перекиды дру другу бессмысленны...не захотели овертайма получите поражение!
*The greatest ending to a football game a Jet fan could ever ask for ....* 🙂👍🏻♥️ #FTP
PAYBACK FOR THE TUCK RULE. FINALLY!
Pat McAfee is now relieved.
3:38 ps5 graphics
They're gonna be running laps LMAO
Racist raider fans who loved them just cuz their costumes are now happy
Blame the Head coach, Belichick lost this game.
RAIDERSSSSS
Mac Jones put in one of the weakest attempts ever at a gamesaving tackle... he wasn't putting his body on the line for the team there
Oh to be a fly on the wall in that dressing room. Haha.
I think back to the time expired Miami play from 2018 (also in December) and just find myself wondering if this is the stupid decision that keeps the Patriots from making it to the playoffs this season...
What a blooper I ain't never saw nothing like that in my life, the way the Raiders won this Game, in what makes it kinda funny the pats Could have just kneeled it in took the game into overtime, Just crazy the way this game ended.
why patriots? LOL boneheads. LOL
Patriots are becoming dumber by the day since Brady left…
That stiff arm from Chandler Jones to Mac Jones oh my oh my😭
couldn't *CHEAT* their way to a victory this time...............LMAO...................
I wasn't expecting that ending!!!!!  WoOoW!!!!
That guy really hates his coach 😆
I wish I could make big money and be this stupid X 2
To think that for 2 decades, the Pats were considered the gold standard for well coached and disciplined teams.  I had to watch this a couple of times to fully understand what happened.  Makes my hair hurt.
Stevenson has some sweet footwork
that is the most embarrassing, life-ending stiff arm ive ever seen. how do you ever show ur face again after that
that Bill guy wasn't smiling so much.
Holy smokes.
Happy ending for the raiders
Lmaoooo 🤣🤣🤣
ROFLMFAO!! That's gold Jerry, gold!! Couldn't have happened to a better team!! F/u New England.
GOSHHHH! Never seen sth like that!
if you didn't think sports are rigged garbage here is your example.
LMAO soo hard... from a Jets fan :)
Go Raiders
Thats why i love nfl go raiders ❤
All you had to do was run out of bounds, Patriots! The game was tied! Except you pulled off a play so stupid that I'd half expect it to come from the mind of Nick "I pretend to be an alpha male when I'm actually a beta loser" Adams.
Unless some major senility has set in, pretty sure that bonehead desperate lateral bidness normally done when a team is losing at the end of regulation and not when they're tied wasn't Bellichick's idea. And who says football players are stupid.
Dumbest decision I’ve ever seen! Why would you do that’s when the clock was zero. Just go down and go to overtime
Heads should roll on the Patriots staff after that ending and also for that blocked punt screwup. What terrible coaching.
Iconic win by the Raiders, Chandler Jones the 🐐🐐🐐👏👏👏👏👏
Dumest move in history of NFL ive seen in decades , unless i missed one ? Idiotic as this ??? What a gift 😂😂😂
Just go to OT unbelievable
UNBELIEVABLE
The only thing I thought when I saw this ending was: After all these years. The football gods finally, after all these years,  gave the Raiders one over the Patriots franchise over the whole "Tuck Rule" situation
If there's anyone Love 💖 A Crazy 🤪 Wild Ending Game??😏..Ask the Patriots 👀🤫🌠
bruh - they should make a statue of that stiff arm to jones
WTF
Bro what happened to the Patriots and why did they do that
I've been watching football all my life like so many others and I'm a 49er fan.. last year in the NFC wild card between the Dallas cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers I thought that was the most bizarre ending I ever seen due to the fact that that Prescott who's getting a huge contract worth millions of dollars didn't know that you were supposed to hand the ball to the referees so they can set it.. and not just him but entire cowboy offense.. not just that and I even told myself there's nothing more bizarre than that with a lot of questions of what the hell they were thinking... I heard about the play before I seen it and even then I told myself I can't be that bad but when I saw it my jaw dropped to the floor.... Now you can tell that the New England Patriots wanted to take the game into overtime because they ran the ball.. but they fumble and they tried to laddered the the ball which makes absolutely no sense.. the only time when you do that is there's only a few seconds and if you're down.... You remember years ago in college it was between the USC Trojans versus the Texas longhorns.. and at the time you had read your post who was considered the best running back at college that certain time and during the game he breaks out and he's running is it all a sudden was about to get tackled he ladder football to another player but he couldn't catch it therefore it was a fumble... So if this can't remind me of that certain playing college now give a lot of respect for the person that threw that ball he took the blame and he didn't point any fingers to anybody else and took responsibility which is really awesome and it shows a lot of character and he seems like the type of player that you want him to succeed...
I blame the Patriots QB he could of stepped in there and made that tackle
Just Win Baby
Never should’ve happened Cole was clearly out of bounds
had to come watch this again! love watching the raiders win
NFL so rigged up.. It's getting worse by the day 😂
somebody's in the doghouse
They need TOM BRADY BACK 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Did they pay him do the water boy play?!
The touchdown that the Raiders scored to tie the game late in the fourth quarter was a touchdown in my opinion.
What???
Comment here if that TD by the Raiders won you your fantasy playoff game
That crazy the quarter back was yelling to down the ball to take it to overtime
Omg whoever does these NFL highlights videos needs to get fired! I’ll do a better job then this! 🤦‍♀️
Невероятно!!! Биличек, наверно, уничтожит парня, который кинул перехват, когда время матча уже истекло. Такого подарка от Patriots я никак не ожидал, обычно как раз Raiders глупо сливают матчи 😊  Карр (QB, Raiders) в клатче провел классный драйв и кинул отличный пасовый TD. Может порой создавать красоту в атаке!  Patriots в атаке ужасны. Нужен новый QB, на одной только защите ничего не выиграть
Belichick was hot 🤬that shot is beautiful 🤣🤣🤣
except that last raiders TD wasn't. His second foot clearly and obviously stepped out of bounds and despite a lengthy review the ref "got it wrong."
As someone who despises the Pats, this... this is just Santa delivering early XD
I never thought I would every see Bill Belichick lead patriots do a boneheaded decision like this
If I didn't know better I'd swear Meyers got paid to do what is now the dumbest move in NFL history. On the bright side the Pats likely saved themselves from playoff embarrassment...
DAWG THEY WHERE GOING INTO OT 😂
The first TD was too easy for Vegas, where was the defense? It was almost clear that a long throw comes at 2 and 20, and the punt after that was so slow, just like a🐢, he should have had a coffee before!
One of the few NFL highlights where the main subject in the thumbnail isn’t on the team that won the game
This is what a betting company is all about... 😁
11:13 *QB Jones cannot defend* *What a joke*
Casual watcher here: was it always los vegas raiders?? i always thought it was los angelus raiders.
The worst pass in football history
2:34 *can someone explain why Jones was upset?*
Wtf happened...
I dunno if this is the coaches fault or the players for how that game turned out. If ur gonna run the clock out and go to OT, just a take kneel. If u figure u wanna try ur luck and score, throw a Hail Mary or a deep corner / out route and try for a game winning FG. But to do whatever it was the Pats did is just mind boggling.
Man that was a dumb play!
Ummmm so about that whole “Who needs each other more Brady or Bellicheck” debate…
Dumb arse, bills head almost popped, you game plan working 100 hour weeks and some Biko does that
Raider Nation from Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 UK 🇬🇧
“Uh-oh…”
Wow
In Bill Belicheck's own words "Just do your job". What idiot called a play that finishes with a lateral to the opposition for a pick 6?
Congratulations Patriots! ESPN has upgraded you from "C'mon man" to "WTF man"
10:59
Why not just go into over time
Just go to over time like you really tought you can get a touchdown like that come on there over 50 hards
Were they too far for FG? I don’t understand
Coming from. 9 er fan CONGRATS Raiders
😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄🫣
OMG! 😲 ONLY The Raiders could win a game like THIS after the season we've had. I been devastated half a dozen times so far....  Here I just burst out LAUGHING! 🤣 M 🦘🏏😎
Don't let that last play distract you from the fact that the Dallas cowboys ran a QB draw up the middle with 14 seconds left and with no timeouts in the wildcard round.
Gaytriots got fluffed!!
Damn..was that Bellichec who called that? Oof might be time to send grandpa to the home....if he did of course
I wasn't aware that the keystone cops played professional football? 🏈😬😂😳🎉😹🙌😬
This never would’ve happened with Tom Brady. 🤦‍♂️
Keelan Cole is going to have a crazy career highlight reel
Too Bad Bill King was not calling thesi give me a HOLY TOLEDO
Daaaaay'um!
The Annexation Of New England
I can’t recall a end of game ended like that but it lacked the perfect game calling ending to it feel! @NFL32owners If all they can say is uh oh, oh no, wow and incredible they both should be fired! I’ve heard college tv host have more excitement thrill with it
Jones vs Jones! What was everyone's favorite touchdown from this game?
Dude mac jones just fell to the ground wtf ?
🤣
fool~
Never saw an ending like that, ever.
woOW ...just friggin woOW  😳🤯😅😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😅
Bwahahahhaha!!
about time we got a break
This is the first highlight video of a Raiders' game that I watch in full this season and, regardless of the obvious Patriots' mistake at the end, I'm glad to see that Mack Hollins has apparently found a home for his talents.  Wish him nothing but success. #AnEaglesFan
Notice how FLAG came up but it was cut off. Either offensive foul or they actually had nothing on the Raiders.
Keelan Cole caught that out of bounds. None of this should have counted sadly
Miles is cryinevg do
I know
I feel sorry for Mac Jones, loosing on a dumb play was embarrassing enough. Dude got punk in the process by another Jones like a kid during the play too.
Good game LV. But you ain't gonna win a SB any time soon
Sorry anyone who dosent see this as an intentional throw the game play at the end is blind. Run the ball twice to run out the clock and go to overtime. Absolutely no other reason to play pitch and catch when tied headed to overtime. If your down yes and even if the other team hit a FG and your trying to win yes. But tied headed to OT no legitimate reason other than a call from above to throw the game.
Bill looked happy.
@11:07 The guys @TNT Sir Charles, Shaq, Kenny, and Ernie were singing the Globetrotters theme.🤣
dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,   lv raiders need that big ass win
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Don't Ever Try To Do A Trick Play On Defense Stupid Las Vegas Raiders With Theeeeeee W
There was only one player in the area where he lateraled the ball, and that player was wearing a raiders jersey. You can't script it better than that.
Can we just start Zappe?
Pats first in Miami miracle in 2018 season now 2022 sin city miracle amazing
Well Patriots that's what you get for trying to pull off of Miami miracle
This is the best ending ever in any football game. Wtfffff
Is it me or does the most lauded franchise in the NFL have some of the craziest losses in history? The loss vs the Dolphins 2018? The helmet catch 2008? Now add this 1
Hell yeah Raiders Nation 💯👏💀🏈🔥
Wow that was the wildest thing I've ever seen. Lol. Billy B you deserve it you cheater.
The commentary make the ending that much better, brilliantly executed forever a historic moment in football
After watching this again, the Pats were up 24-17 with 3:20 remaining in the game. Mac Jones runs a bootleg @ 3:01. That's the game. When Brady was there, the Pats mastered the 4:00 drill. Draining the clock and moving the ball to convert timely first downs. Btw, whose genius idea was it for Mac Jones to run a bootleg?! Against Crosby? 🤔
Lol...I kept replaying the end man this was  freakin' Awesome!
I bet that Patriot who threw the ball away had a tough time in the locker room, after the game.
Craziest ending of the season? 😳 🏈🔥
2 pass interference no calls, and helmet to helmet, and a non touchdown (84)...stay classy Oakland. Oh and Mac, you cant throw and that was the dumbest play I think I have ever seen to end a game. Retire now Mac please.
And noone talking about how raiders. Only tied cause of a horrible TD call. Figures . NFL is rigged
That picked off screen was pure speed and elite film watching
Hmm 🤔 Vegas 🤔 Gambling 🤔
Patriots are turning into a clown show WTF is going on. How do you not just got into OT.
What the hell was that? Hilarious!!!!
What a stupid play to cost you the game 😂😂😂😂
The dumbest play in NFL history belongs to the Patriots. WOW
christmas gift 🤣🤣
PATS  got burned!! He was clearly out of bounds!!! His foot was in the white!! Bullshit!!!
Yeah, I think picking lolcow of the week might be a bit simpler this time…..
it was tied...... why are you doing this?
Nothing like getting slayed with your own sword….thanks chandler jones way to smash our playoff run…expatriot
Belichick was so mad. Lol. The blocked punt,  then that ending. The facility is gonna be brutal all week
There's no way that was Belichick's play call.
Who the stronger jones chandler jones vs Mac jones now me know
Belichick had to be fuming!!
Spupid plays and players will make you lose games... so much for the theory that Bill Belichik is still a good coach
All the glory and all the defeat.  PATRIOTS!
🤣
It’s called blatantly throwing a game
Great game right up to the last second.  Ridiculous.
Jones on Jones violence... GOTTA LOVE IT🤣🤣🤣 RN4L
All the patriots haters really popping off in this comment section.
Jacoby meyers flexing doing the most at the end then loses the game gotta love it you ain’t flexing anymore buddy raiders!! 😂
lol how crazy was that???!
"Finally!!! It took 16 years for someone to think of someone else when it comes to horrible laterals"       -Reggie Bush
That's how you get benched.
Flag: Tuck rule 😂
Hey patriots there's something called overtime?
lol... I heard people talk about it but didn't know it was that bad. Wtf was he thinking.
What do you expect when you turn football into Volleyball 🤔
Wow, just wow!
Ignoramus
But.... like why would you not just go into OT
Football karma for BB.
What the heck was that?
Pffftt....   fix!!!
Being a Patriots fan was so much fun growing up when I was young and naive and they were constantly winning. Now it’s just a comedy club 🤡 Oh well, I can’t do any of what these players do so my opinion doesn’t mean squat. Buuut come oooon
For non-Pats fans it's truly something special for a Bill Belichick team to make the stupidest play in NFL history.
I hate being alive
I just don’t understand the raiders this year why tf are they always in a close game lol they can play the best team or the weakest team they always gonna find a way to be ina close match bro it’s like they just match the team they play
My favorite part about the final play? The fact that chandler jones missed the tackle on the handoff. Jones has a chance to get steveson just past the line but stevenson slipped out of his grasp and ran downfield. I'll just say it's a far less memorable ending if Jones makes that first play. Greatest missed tackle of his career.
Survey Question:  Should a deflected, or blocked, punt create the scenario where the ball is now "live" and either can attempt to take possession of the ball?  Technically, the receiving team has touched the ball after the kicker has relinquished possession of it(like a quarterback and a tipped pass). 03:54 It can be argued that changing this rule would elevate special teams plays.  What do you all think?
Did Bill Parcel became stupid after Brady left or we have given him too much credit in the past ?
Good job by the nfl to think up this ending,click bait worked.
Scripted ending
Yo D-Ski. How do you like that one?
Stupidest s*** I've ever seen. What's the rationale? The first guy flips it I don't know why. But then the second guy starts running backwards and then throws a 20 yard backwards forward pass. There's something called overtime in NFL. And you weren't losing the game was tied. .. WTF????????? STUPID MAN. STUPID.
Wtf did I just watch
Man I hate Mac jones Dude doesnt even get stiff armed He hits the floor before the arm even contacts him Brady WOULD throw his damn body at the guys legs at the least
Not a raiders fan but glad they starting to playing well my favourite player is there Adam’s
Watching Mac Jones fail at any effort to tackle dude on the last play and just get RAN over is so hilarious lol.
That's the silliest ending to a game I've ever seen 🤣🤣🤣
The Band is on the Field!
What a raiders way to lose. Actually that’s also a raiders way to win too. Pure luck at the end
YouTube recommended a "You cost us the game" compilation the other day. Feels like that viedeo need an update pretty bad 🤣
Love my RRRRRAAAAAIDERSSS ❤️❤️
Carr couldn't have telegraphed that INT easier. Jesus, sometimes I wonder if his head takes a break for a bit when they're on offense.
Damn talk about a rigged ending 😅
wowee
If we could just get this play, from all angles, with different reactions, post game commentary, on loop for an hour, honestly I feel like this play could get its own documentary
It almost looks staged. And I really hate to say that. Nobody can be that stupid.
I can't stop replaying it. The way Chandler Jones just absolutely buries Mac with the stiffarm
Lmaooooo that was funny , it wasn't even Stevenson's fault
Belichick’s retiring
hahahahahaha should’ve went out & kicked a field goal what were y’all thinking lol
It would be nice if The NFL f.o. would stop fixing games. I don't caree what anyone says @ me being a Pats Fan...  All I want is for NO reviews going to f.o. execs in N.Y. for the final say on a play. I've seen it too often (many diff. teams, many games). 100% of the rest of planett earth sees a replay review where the call is obvious...And then the final say goes to the suits in NY, and they choose the exact opposite. I don't care who you are, If you love the game, you want a rule passed where in-game, the officials should have Absolutely ZERO contact with nfl f.o. execs, during the entire game=NONE. Nfl f.o. execs have ZERO say at all.
Patriots told 2015 colts. Hold my beer.
Patricia should be fired right away
Unbelievable! 🤦‍♂
I thought this would happen to 1 of the htown teams, mainly the Texan, but dat waz straight out of a movie like the Waterboy, Damn😂😂🤣
Davante Adams should have never left Green Bay
The Patriot Way....free of Brady.  Imagine how many Superbowls they'd been without the GOAT?  You don't have toe imagine much at all.
Finally! The Raiders have their own Immaculate Reception!
Pats suck and I'm loving every minute
I'm a huge Raiders fan but I just have to the Patriots why wouldn't you just kneel down and just go into overtime I mean that's just common sense
That’s one he’ll never live down
Most funny team new england
We got the real jones #RaiderNation baby!!!!!
Im very surprised Bill Belly didnt just kneel on the last play. Even a fumble would have been at risk.
Thank you Raiders, you couldn’t have done it to a more deserving group of pricks
This has got to be the fastest and easiest way for one player to lose a game.
Bro someone getting cut!
How the patriots lose in the most raider way ever?! 😅
Go raiders baby
The Raiders Mystique found it’s way to Vegas. Raiders have been involved in many controversial plays in NFL/AFL history win or lose.
At least the patriots were on the other side of the former worst play in football. That colts fake punt LOL.
who is the analyst that says "all we need are those chants they do at the soccer games"? brilliant
I was hoping to see a replay of the play where the Raiders tied it at 24... Did anyone else see it somewhere else? If so, did the receiver get both cleats down inbounds? Did the Pats challenge the play?
Jones misses tackle. Good job to stay in the play LOL. Did he think lateraling it to Mac Jones was ever a good idea? Interstingly  enough, he got down in the previous play.
And then, Matt Ryan decided that life is not that bad.
Was that supposed to be a tackle attempt by Mac Jones 11:15???
What was that?
There's levels to this WTF game
Haven’t they heard of O.T 😂
Too funny!
The funniest part was how Chandler Jones just pushed Mac aside like he was a little school boy.
Dude turned the ball over on purpose on the lateral. There was one but raiders jerseys back that way. Still think roger goodell ain't full of crap?
This tops dropping the ball on the 1 yard line .
To Belichek and other Patriots players this probably reminded them of the "Miracle in Miami"back in 2018
Mac Jones just laid down like a cardboard cutout .that will be hard to shake off.
For the people who believe nfl is real, you all have been fooled.
This is poetry.
Patriots really had enough time for a field goal. They ruined this game
This is the modern day version of Jim Marshall's scoring a TD for the opposition decades ago. Epic fail.  Can you imagine what Belichick was thinking!?
The touchdown that the Raiders got to win the game was amazing!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 wtf free win lol
Yeah we did really bad, like really bad, but that last play should’ve been a flag on the raiders
Raiders got given a TD by the refs but even as a patriots fan, I can’t defend that bum ass call to not go into OT. Ridiculous
That’s okay. Till they get the amount of rings we got. This one doesn’t sting as much 💚
that's such a raider way to lose. good job, patriots!
the nfl is looking more and more like peewee football each week
Yaye
Wow, the Patriots are the laughing stock of the NFL right now. I feel like we're back to the joke the Patriots were pre-Robert Kraft ownership...😭
Monday meeting with Bill musta been lit.
I wonder if he thought that the Pats were losing... that or got greedy.  Should have been.more aware of the situation and what to do at that moment. Go down and go to OT!!!! with that being said..... 🐻 ⬇️
The Patriots just lost in the most Raiders way possible
I will always root for any team that plays against the pootriats.. The Patriots and belchichick can eff off. They've cheated they're way to wins long enough, they're done.
What an idiot
Don't need to hear a PEEP from ANY Pats fans either!  Raiders are owed a good 10 of those calls/games against them for the Tuck Rule BS!
In the boxscore will it be listed as intercepted lateral return or fumble return?
I think it's funny how mac and cheese thought he would throw his hands up to get a flag which of course he's used to. But you don't get a flag when you're being a Defender dude. LOL hysterical
Does anyone else think this looked rehearsed? That was so so weird of a play to run, and nobody was doing anything, it looked like this was rehearsed, and everybody knew what was happening
Even tho the raiders won as a fan it's sickening to see us have such big leads a d always blow them yall suck fr lame af it's sad to be a raider fan at this point
what did I just watch?
Wow patriots im a jets fan nd im mad from that thnx tho
Sorry, noobs here, why patriots play like that? it’s a tied game....
As a Vikings fans, that ending might have been better than our game. I watched Kirk make history in DC, and watched him make history again yesterday.  But I have never seen anything like that, ever.  I'd officially like to welcome the Raiders to the "magical field" of the NFL gods.  Please be considerate, Vikings have dibs.
A small dose of payback for the Pats hosing the Raiders with the "forward pass" in the playoffs. Lots of payback coming for years of shady playing and coaching for Billy Bellycheck and little Tommy Brady. Enjoy, guys. You deserve it
11:00  "Uh oh!   "It's picked off! "Uh oh! "Oh no! "Unbelievable! "Oh wow!... "Incredible!... "CHANDLER JONES, TAKES IT IN, AND WINS THE GAAAME FOR THE RAIDERS!"  great sportscasting, those inflections had me rewinding that last minute of the video, what a bittersweet ending for Belichick n company  The cruel irony is, the first guy to miss his tackle was the guy who snatched the ball and ran it in!
Stupid last play by the Patriots
Wwe wife wcw. Another scripted nfl game
o wow
Pats jus gave the W away😂
Wow. Just why? Why, I say.
That was the dumbest lateral in football history not even in nfl alone just football in general , like bro…wtf was tht
Idk who's fail was worse, Pats or the Bucs
5:08 is a good example of a player who watches game film! He didn't get lucky with the pick-6...  he knew ... from watching the formation and situation it was gonna be a quick pass. By studying the Raiders game films from this season
He’s gonna hear Bills mouth until tax season😭😭😭😭😭
"it's a good offensive series led by the running game" most redundant statement i've heard all week. have you seen Mac Jones pass? of course anything good we do is because of the run game lol
Just stupid, go to overtime. But this Pats are just a lost team
Alternate ending.... Jones celebrating at the 5 yard line,.... Meyers comes back, strips the ball, and runs it back 95  yards for the win! Go Patriots!
What the hell was Belichick thinking!!??? I thought he was the greatest NFL coach ever. Guess not, it was all Tom Brady that made him look good
How about the refs screwing us over with their game tying td? THE REFS SUCK 10:13 no idiot could miss that screw the refs
The Patriots need a better coaching staff or a new coach
😂😂😂 insane lol
Bellachek is a pure scrub, a real no good hobo.
Jones on Jones attack shown here lol go Raiders !
Tsk tsk
His foot was clearly out of bounds
As a Raiders fan, this was the greatest game in history.😉
I thought I've seen it all...but THIS?!
The last crazy play of the game really prove that Football coach should create a playbook for those kind of play just like in Rugby, it would be awesome to see that more often.
Mac jones last play literally got stepped on n over 😂
As a Raiders fan, this is typically the kind of way I would expect us to LOSE a game but I’ll take it lol
Wtf was Myers thinking
11:13 will forever be funny man ran over mac jones
As a raiders fan sometimes the Raiders dish out historical L’s
It was crafty to stay on the logo of the raiders Black with a Black jearsy  the patriote's player did not see him at all
Lol how do they have a chandler Jones touchdown illustration but not for Mack hollins or Keelan Cole who are on offense
Why? Just why? And now we all have a rebuttal against the Patriots.“ We have 6 Super Bowl wins!” Oh yeah, well what about that Raiders game?! 😢
Without that questionable sequence that ended the game the raiders would’ve blown another one. I want McDaniels gone bad after every game
never would i have thought someone would out raider that raiders, well thanks for the dub ig
I loved it so happy go raiders
#rigged lol if anyone thinks that was real you're an idiot
The tuck rule redemption..
#16 playin for the ops at the end there🤣
11:11  : frankly i don't know what that very bad rugby play is doing in a football game but it's very funny. I could not stop laughing for 5 minutes 🤣
The botched lateral
Imagine if that dumb play resulting in a win just like that for other team in Superbowl with 0 seconds left lol
This is not the Patriot way 🤣
Brrrrattt 11:12
Why bill b is still coaching  What else he has got to prove  Why is Tom Brady playing  What else he has to prove  Why is a Rodgers playing  These are clueless to me.  All of them are all time great n in the hall of fame.  No sense.  Why these legends don’t get it.  God bless all of them
"The Lucky Loss in Las Vegas" Will go down in emphamy.
That's just dumb. Why do that?
10:16 foot was clearly out, yet nobody cares
It took over 2 decades but karma finally caught up with the Patriots and Pats fans and I'm here for it. 😆 I wish I could upvote this video 100 times.
#3 on the blocked punt https://youtu.be/V5jZC6orXQg?t=235 was not ready or pointing to something.
Pitchy pitchy woo woo
Yea that guys done 😂
This game makes up for the week before. Raiders all day.
Patriots Doffensive Coordinator: "Just get the ball in Jones' hands.."  Meyers: "I did my part."
OMG! So that's how it ended? Wow.
So glad I missed this game🤦‍♂️
Honestly, if this humiliating defeat has no consequences in the offense, I have no words. Is Zappe and different offensive calling no option anymore? With this offense the pats will get stomped in the playoffs
It's like another JR Smith or Chris Webber fail all over again; just a total lack of any kind of situational awareness.
Ugly.
A mistake was made. They happen. Sport is for fun not recriminations and nastiness. It was a mistake, regroup, learn from it and carry on.
They must have thought “We need to not get tackled to win the game. You there 👉🏻 please don’t get tackled.”   Mac Jones and Bill Belicheck (however you spell it): 🤦🏻‍♂️
People are coming up with names for this ending . So I have come up with my own “Jones vs Jones “
No replay on the not touchdown? Lol
“The Stanford band no where in sight!” 😂😂😂
Bill has now been a part of two embarrassing last second lateral plays. The play against Miami where he put Gronk on the field thinking they would throw a hail mary even though Miami wasn't close to a point on the field where a hail mary was possible and this dumb play.
“Stanford band nowhere in sight” lmao
Let’s go raider nation
What a bonehead. They should stick to celebrating as a group in the end zone rolling imaginary boats and other childish things and leave actual football to men
The NFL is clearly rigged (not a pats fan)
Why he not just go down? Lol It would've gone to OT.  It wasn't that desperate of a situation. Lol
bill belichick 😂😂😂😂 practice will be brutal this week
What?!?!?!?!?!?! I thought Bill's teams were always the smartest and best coached teams? I guess it was easier with Brady to be great.
Patriots should get donkey of the day
I will never understand what Jakobi Meyers was thinking here
So many raider haters in the comments just take y’all L and keep going next team up damn not that hard stop running your mouth keep going
Every time the Patriots lose , the world is a better place. Thank you Raiders!
I love watching the Patriots implode
wow 🥺 Cold 🥶 endinG !
They definitely weren’t aware of the score, that’s crazy 😂
Belichick looked super pissed walking on field at the end lol
Just like Bill drew it up.
Mac jones will now be known for getting dribbled😂😂
If they had a kicker with a leg as strong as Dempsey's, they could had kicked a FG. 70 yards in a dome was well in his range. But on a serious note, cannot believe he ran backwards and threw the ball back towards Jones.
Loool and these fools were never making those mistakes in Brady era. Unfortunately only now they are getting their comeupponance for all the luck and all the bad calls in their favour when Tommy was there
LMFAOOOO
about stupidest play i ever saw. 'i ain't see the dude' is what meyers said. what a freakin putzz. could have got paid to do that however. it was in vegas.
FIRE BILL WTH WAS THAT? WHYYY!!!
This clip will be shown in videos 20 years from now
HE STOMPED YO SHI
I don’t understand why the Patriots went for it with 3 seconds on the clock (at their 45 yards line). They were tied. Take a knee and go to overtime.
Patriots will never forget how they losses this game to the Raiders 😂
Raiders need a defense.
I can just imagine Tom Brady calling Belichick about the rough upset he had against Cincinnati and Belichick going "boy, do I have story for you".
wouldnt like to listen to Bill after this
Bunch of bull💩 new England why didn't he just run out of bounds
las going to the playoffs
Wow 😮  That was karma for the Tuck rule 😂😂😂
Nothing good has come from a lateral play involving the Patriots.
Bill will retire soon.
It’s like the patriots forgot the defensive team can get the ball and score too, insane L
Only in Raiders game! Just win, baby truly applies!! #rf4l
The curse has been reversed
Didn't see that coming lol
WHO DOES THAT?
Imagine getting a touchdown for not even being inbounds that’s like westbrick shooting an air ball and getting 3 points for it.
Imagine getting a touchdown for not even being inbounds that’s like westbrick shooting an air ball and getting 3 points for it.
New England has a GOAT. They now have a goat.
Imagine getting a touchdown for not even being inbounds that’s like westbrick shooting an air ball and getting 3 points for it.
Biggest boneheaded play since the Pisarchik fumble
The OAKLAND. RAIDERS.  2023💯🎅🥂.NFL. WORLD. CHAMPIONS. HOLMES 👉🍺🏈☠️☠️🌲☃️🚩👍🏅🏈☠️🍺🍻☠️🏈👈 💪 JUST. STILL. WINNING. ESE. HOLMES 👽✨✨☠️💪.  BUT. Now. They. R. The. LAS. VEGAS. RAIDERS. HOLMES 👽👽👽🤟👍🏅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸♨️⚔️⚔️💀💀
ахахахахахахаххаахха
That would never happen to Brady.
LMFAOO NAH! How did it end like that when all he has to do was go out of bounds for OT
Was that a coaching error or errors by the players?  Did Bill or Matty P actually say to do that?
As a fan of neither team (especially can't stand the pats!)   That looks RIGGED
Mac Jones could have received his "Man card" with a tackle but it was not meant to be.
EFN  BEAUTIFUL  JUST WIN BABY!!!
As a Raiders fan, I’m so fkn happy with his stupidity 😂
I christen this game " THE WACKED THROWBACK!"  LMAO!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
11:00 what a play
Bill is bout make everyone run at practice
Well....there is a first time for everything I guess
11:12 -- -- That straight arm was epic.. Dude didn't just shrug Jones off he iffin buried him.. LOL
Dear Pats, Brady took all the magic tricks WITH him. LOL!!!
As a raiders fan, we did not deserve this win. Which makes it feel even more sad and exciting at the same time🤣
Of course you guys don’t show the kelan cole catch where he was CLEARLY OUT OF BOUNDS rigged ass league it’s a shame
That read by dugger 🔥🔥🔥🔥 talk about watching film
Patriots fans will cry about the TD before this but remember you guys still could of won in overtime. We were 0-4 in these situations. I was even expecting you guys to win in OT. Patriots shot themselves in the foot.
Just finshed work as I live in England so didn't get time to watch it on Sunday. Watched the highlights. WHAT IN THE RED HELL WAS THAT in the dieing seconds of the game. Let it go to over time.
all he had to do was fall down..i understand no time on the clock but CMON MAN!
Well the patriots are gonna be down a player after today
I think someone forgot to tell Jakobi Meyers that Christmas is next week. He just gave us our gift early.
IF History repeats it self number 16 and number 38 might not see another play as a patriot lol this the same coach then bench his Rb after having a great game and benched his cornerback never to be seen again
Raiders got their tuck rule revenge
Reminds of the J.R. Smith play w the Cavs
💀
LOL. Better than the Miami Miracle.
uh-oh, uh-oh...........it's hammer's time!
As a Jets fan it's absolutely fantastic to see the Patriots lose in such an embarrassing way 😂😂
I'm surprised that a Belichick team would be f'ing around like that in the first place. I guess he really wanted to make up for the Dolphin game last year.
This  is for the tuck rule
It's official. The Pats aren't a threat to the League anymore
Cut Stephenson and Meyers immediately. Pay their contracts if necessary but get both those ABSOLUTELY BRAINDEAD IDIOTS off the team, TODAY. 100% INEXCUSABLE
Couldn't happen to a better group of cheaters.
Sure NFL, just skip over the part where Keelan Cole steps out of bounds on the last TD pass! Jeezus! These refs are being paid in bananas to think that was in bounds! BS
Ya hate to see that
The question I have is why is Chandler Jones at that place on the field...he really shouldn't even be there, he should be further down field trying to make a tackle. He got lazy and it paid off with the most epic game winning touchdown since the Minneapolis Miracle.
For any Raiders fan, this is a once in a lifetime ending. Loved it so much I had to watch multiple times!
Man this is Come On Man, NFL Follies, Greatest Ending Ever, Worst Ending Ever, Worst Decision Ever, Top Ten, Not Top Ten, all in one play. Unreal. I honestly can't imagine being a Pats fan watching that live as it happened.
What a PATHETIC attempt at a tackle by the QB!!
The patriots longest pass of the night was completed by Jacoby myers, also the first time a patriot player has thrown for a td in the 4th quarter all season 🤣🤣
Jones is such a cry baby, a good replacement for the last cry baby.
That was a crazy ending.
And you thought I ve seen everything in American Football after watching so many games sind so many years...hahaha
What was the flag for?
LMAO the fall of the patriots.. GO JETS.
Wow.  TWO players gave up the ball.  I'm wondering how much of this is lack of coaching preparation.  How much is maybe head trauma?  Unfathomable play at that level.
Worst loss in Patriots history! Embarrassing hahaha!
This is called Fixing ! This play must be thoroughly investigated to confirm any foul play outside the field.
This is something that would happen to the Raiders. Not the Patriots. LOL
"Stanford band nowhere in sight."   A prescient call by Kenny Albert, and really this play rivals that for incredibility
Somebody def getting fired on they day off lol
This was an embarrassing loss 🤣🤣🤣, but Ryan holds the record for 2 of the worst losses ever lmao
That is how los Vegas pay to win. Football just a game to make dumb people to believe. It's not real.
A mistake the Niners will not make in a-couple weeks. 😊😊
😳 OMG
I was going to watch this, but then I decided that smashing my genitals with a meat tenderizer repeatedly for 15 min would be less painful.    Signed,  A Patriots Fan
What a satisfying stiff arm to win the game 💪🏻
What an astounding final play.
Love the black and silver uniforms. Like take no prisoners!
This is very exciting NFL season
11:13 you blessed, lol
And Spygate, Cheats, deflated ballons, traps e.t.c. that make pats won at least 3 of 6 SB where are they now??
Squirek reincarnated @5:07
That's the craziest thing I've ever seen. What were these guys thinking???
For anyone who says that the NFL is scripted or rigged, this last play in the game makes a strong case for it
I guess mac has never tackled someone in his life. That was embarrassing
I felt bad for Meyers. He never expected to have a lateral thrown his way (it was never discussed at all before the play), and he panicked.
Tbh he threw it right to him like he want him to score. Rigged games
GO RAIDERS!!!
Who was number 16 throwing it to?  He had time to think.
☝️🧐 That's why I always said that foolishly passing the 🏈 football laterally to other players at the end of a game is the silliest thing that players do . Now the PATRIOTS loss because of that silly play .
I thought belichick was a mastermind coach like Walsh, what happened ?? This rivals the colts game !! fo fo fo football player urrrr
I’m so glad I didn’t watch this game because my blood pressure would have been through the roof. I’m happy and I’ll take the W but we can’t keep winning games by a hair anymore
Rhamondre Stevenson & Jakobi Meyers: "Ain't nobody got time for OT."
I couldn’t help but notice the league didn’t include any review angles of Keenan Cole’s ‘touchdown’ 🧐
That was terrible. But let's not act like Bill Belichick forgot how to coach football. People need to relax.
How dumb can he get by throwing that ball
Tbh he just wanted to head to the strip club sooner rather than later. Can't blame the guy.
LOL
National Fixed League
To be honest the ending just made me mad we should have just been overtime come on Patriots we 7 or 7 we still got a shot in the playoffs but damn we need to do better
🤟😁 AMANDA ( WALLER'S ) husband on t.v.  ...... Cool .
Beautiful ending🤣😂
How to get cut 101
Did he forget that Chandler Jones wasn't still playing for the Patriots?  Because he threw it right to him!
As a pats fan last play almost made me throw up 🤮
The best comeback of the year go Raiderssssssssss 🍻💯🙏
Leon Lett is somewhere smiling
Belichick’s all-time record without Tom Brady: 114-130
Still not worse than the fail mary
The rare youtube video where everyone will watch the end
I would've loved to hear Gus Johnson call that last play lol
Incredible.
What's the hell... Why the pats pass the ball ??!! 🫣
That patriot had a J.R Smith moment😂
You know your bad,when you lose to the raiders!!!
It’s starting to look scripted. NFL rigged so sad
That player is getting benched rest of season lol
That was STUPID………JAAAAKKKKOOOBIIIIIII YOU GOT DAMN BUM!
I loved it  ... The Raiders won the game and helped the Chargers get into the playoffs. Thanks guys 😃👍
I said it last week and I'll say it again; NE just plays better when they DON'T have the ball.  They are tied with Arizona for most defensive points scored per game this year.
Nfl looking more rigged everyday
Who came up with the schedule for the Raiders?  One week they have to go against "the tuck rule" team and six days later they have to go against "the immaculate reception" team.
Had mac jones made that tackle at the end bro.
I love how the guy who scored the last touchdown was just chilling there already done playing and they just tossed him the ball. 😂
Stupidest thing I've ever seen a football team do...what a bonehead play. They  were TIED!!! Just go down and take it to OT.
I've never seen anything that ridiculous ever before
That stiff arm was priceless smh
He had a lane
I was taking an order at this restaurant I work at and saw this live and had to stop for a full minute from laughing so hard 💀💀💀
Hilarious!!!
Que vergüenza de equipo esos patriotas
Belichick's job would be at home watching the grandkids play touch football if I were the Patriots GM! Ijs --it was a bonehead play. The game was tied and 14 seconds left. His Patriot team had outplayed the Raiders practically the whole 2nd half. The odds of that weak Raider team beating them in OT was slim to damn near MF's you gonna need a EFF'N miracle to win! In the end tho, Raider nation got their miracle and without running a single offensive play--TD!!! 14 seconds early.
Terrible coaching, 0 game sense by the players of NE. Happy for raiders, they deserved this one
I hope it was fun New England because this is the new order and we'll be here to laugh in your faces EVERY SINGLE TIME.
The biggest c'mon man of the year 🤣 what an idiot
911 what's your emergency?   Yeah uhh I just ate a stiff arm from Chandler Jones and we lost the game.
Somewhere, somebody found that "I resign as HC of the NYJ" napkin and lit it on fire.
Bill parcels is laughing his ass off these coaches are a joke
This game is so fixed by betting sites smells really bad
Bill B is fucken pissed!!
This is history. 😢
Quarterback has Zero defense capability.
16 on patriots is the biggest retard
Someone is gonna have a hard time at practice
What a weird but good game!!!
Jesus, this gotta be the worst play ever. Even the dude that wrong way for the Vikings ages ago only gave up a safety and didn't cause them to lose the game..incredible
As a Diehard Patriots fan every time I see Jones get trampled by Jones and the announcers say 'Uhh ohh' I can't stop laughing at how horrible it is ... that offensive miscue is as BAD as it GETS!!!
Just another Game of the Patriots with no single TD-Pass and a Completion-Rate way under 70%....!!! The Ending was horrible, but would the Offence score it wouldn't have come to this. We have a huge QB-Problem and a OC-Problem too. When will they cange something?
If mahomes did that flee flicker to Jacob’s it would’ve been everywhere
Desperate laterals weren't necessary, were they...so silly...
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ !!!!! *NICE*
Other than in OT, I can't remember the last time I seen an actual pick 6 to win the game when down or tied. I've seen missed field goals returned, I've seen teams that were ahead take off the last play of the game return it for six, but never a team that was tied or behind pick 6 to win the game with no time left.
Did someone put a bag over Belichick's head before calling this play?
WTF was he thinking?
WTF was that ???? Someone has to be FIRED and/or CUT !!!! That was situational buffoonery. 🤡🤪🤡🤪🤡🤪🤡 A former NE All-Pro scores the TD. Poetic Justice for BB
My 96 year old grandma is more athletic than Mac Jones.
Looks kinda set up to me especially when you here what the commentators went about it on the final play just listen
I watched this clip again and noticed he immediately takes his helmet off.while on camera. He wanted the buzz. And he is getting it.
1. I've never seen this 2. So glad the dumbest thing I've seen in my life wasn't myself on YouTube. Ty Patriots
Please, Call it for what it is, Stupid, Stupid, Stupid.
EAT THAT PATRIOTS
Lol bro just take it to OT fool
As if Bill Belichick doesn't already look naturally angry asf without mistakes 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Oh well, at least we ain't the Colts
Being a Raider fan you get 4 or 5 weeks of Playoff Football.
i want everyone fired on the pats everyone! fire the water boy fire the laundry boy fire bill!!!!
Mac Jones literally tackled himself.  Also who in the F was he trying to lateral that ball to?
Raiders " We don't want to hold this L, would you take it? " Patriots " I'm going to throw the ball to you, don't worry "
L patriots 😢😂
What in the heck. That's something I would do, and that's why I'm not in the NFL.
The pats should have just ran the clock out until OT Gee wiz..   finally the patriots are on the losing side of a crazy win
Could there be any bigger backfire than this 🤣🤣🤣
I've waited 20 years for the Raiders to beat the Patriots...FINALLY.
Safe to say his days as a Patriot are numbered
History in the making for Las Vegas👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Embarrassing.
LOOOL
In the word's of Vince Lombardi. What the hell is going on here!
Still doesn't make the game at New England in the snow in AFC Championship 2001 when Raiders got FD from going to Superbowl with tuck BS rule any better
That was a staged fix+ come on this is starting to get out of hand!
Stupid is as stupid does
Watching Bill lose is always fun for me!
Wtf I know Billachik went nuts in the locker room
The Derek Carr cheeseburger pick six toppings and paid dearly for it
Jim Marshall: FINALLY!  A bigger bonehead play than mine!!! 🤷🏽‍♂️
Moral of the story: JUST GO TO OVERTIME.
this is the pay back for all the cheating you have done int he past !!!
That play works 95% of times in back yard football,  but this is the NFL and 95% of the time you're asking for trouble if you're throwing the ball around like that.
_ so who stays Bill B. or the QB - going to be an intriguing off-season in the higher northeast of America ?!?
Belichick needs to retire. The young generation will never be disciplined and follow your instructions. " just do your job " philosophy is over and dead. Old school football minds need to get out now. Let the new generation of Twitter and Instagram and social justice warriors figure it out now.
Been a Raider fan all my life I am thoroughly embarrassed by this year's team they gave up 21 unanswered points they've been doing that all season blowing double-digit leads in my mind they lost that game
Imagine if Chandler Jones DIDN'T completely whiff on the tackle to begin with. Then he wouldn't of just been standing there to pick it off as the Patriots made one of the all time dumbest gaffs in NFL history. EPIC!!!
Just when you thought you've seen it all in sports. The ending of this game will go down in NFL lore.
This loss could not have happened to a nicer fan base.  LOL
The only way this could have been better is if it was a playoff game and in Foxboro in the snow... Tuck rule revenge, baby
All they had to do was go to OT.
This annotation was the result of what? It wasn't an interception, it wasn't a fumble, what was it?
Never expected a ending like this lol
"Stanford Band Nowhere in sight!" 🤣
Looks like he threw the game.
Blows my mind how horrible the refs can be to clearly see his foot out of bounds and still call a touchdown
Oh, oh no...ha ha
The Last moment like i got happy af
Stevenson was having a monster game.....and then he pitched the ball. I'd wonder who thought that play was a good idea....but then I remember Patricia is manning the helm
Mac Jones needs to make... 😂 NVM...
Wow! Billy's not going to be happy with that guy 😆
Instant C'mon Man moment.
Always love to see Belichick sad after he abandoned Cleveland.
Lol
Y'all can't tell this is FIXED??? C'mon now!!
Greatest NFL ending ever 😂
RRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIDDDDDDDDEEEEEEERRRRRRSSSSSS!!!!!!
U pizdu materinu
Of course nobody is talking bout how that was NOT a touchdown at the end but if it was the other way around, it would be a different story..
That Stiff Arm Was Hella Strong Damn Near Broke Dude Body On His Way To The End Zone 🤣🤣🤣
Raiders
The pulled a raider on the raiders
11:00 is why you’re here 😂
Bro wtf just happened at the end????? I saw Stephenson took the blame but that was all on 11
That ending was his embarrassing as this Trump NFT card trading game. Unreal, these are supposed to be professional athletes. Folks, if you want to see some enjoyable games, watch lacrosse. A lot more fun, a lot more scoring, and you don't have any of these primadonna's who think that they have a right to everything.
Imagine if this was a playoff game
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 so stupid
A joke ending to a joke season in NE. The Dolphins deserve a playoff shot more than my Pats this season.
Just woooow 😮
That had to be the biggest brain fart in all of professional sports.
Even Chandler Jones was like "are you sure?"
They didn't want to show how mind-numbingly awful the blown call was at 10:25
We are the stupidest team in the NFL
I have been a Patriots fan since the day I was born. Through thick and thin. But I have never in my 65 yrs. seen a more ridiculous play in my life. CRAPPPPPPPP! And that's putting it mildly. GO PATS! I still love ya!
Regardless of the raiders record at seasons end you will have the best highlight to cherish in the 2022 season. Congrats raider nation. Raider Dave will be pleased.
Belichick & Brady had an unheard of incredible run but it's time for both to move on and go out with dignity..They should retire together - and face it Mac Jones will never be able to compete in an AFC with Mahomes, Allen ,Herbert, Burrow, Jackson , Watson and now even Lawrence is playing great..
The fox commentary team on the game was outstanding.  Especially the last play. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
how is that not a false start on 72. He clearly moves before the ball is even snapped. These Refs are horrible...Or the are betting on games they are reffing
that uh oh was everything lol
Patriots losing their 💩 🤦
I lived long enough to see the 2nd stupidest play in NFL History.  The First of course, will forever be Wilson throwing the INT in the Super Bowl, thus handing the Patriots shiny new Rings.
As a patriots fan I stopped watching football when Tom Brady left. Coming back and seeing my team the way it is genuinely saddens me
Go raiders, ps Mac jones is horrible
I was working at buffalo wild wings when this happen. The place was roaring in anger and rejoice. I couldn't believe it.
patriots can't win close games with jones, he is just not that guy
The stuff of future blooper reels!
Somewhere, Matt Patricia is looking at his play sheet thinking "I'm so smart" 🤣
Damn... I knew I should've watched this game.
Holly crap batman  😳
So many fans going through " Emotional Damage!"
The New England Patriots are the VILLAGE IDIOTS of the NFL this year and in 2nd place is the Indianapolis Colts who blew a 33 point lead in the 2nd half of Saturday afternoon to the Minnesota Vikings , just saying , LMFAO 🤣🤣🤣 , ENUFF SAID
Pats are going to finish the season at 7 - 10 - biggest off season worry has got to be at QB > Mac Jones is not the answer *PERIOD*    Pats can't compete with Burrow,Herbert,Mahomes, Jackson,Allen
THE ENDING:              W          T           F          ???????
Number one on cmon man, gon b on shaqtin it was so bad 🤣🤣
The hilarious part was watching QB Jones trying to tackle Cameron Jones .. that should have it's own soundtrack.
bill had to of wanted to lose the game or somethin.
Mac just cant get the ball downfield it's so frustrating to watch
It's always nice to see a Belicheat team lose but this was the best one so far!
HE think he tha mack...macaroni Jones, cmon mannnn
Let's not forget Mac Jones was a horrendous 13/31 and 0 TD's again..
The crazy game losing lateral aside, seems the Pats had plenty of time to get into field goal range and THEN use that final time out.
And this, comrades, is why we do not attempt the West Coast Weave.
I hope it was a genius belichik call. But I suspect it was the players
In a tie game wouldn't you protect the lead??  Your thirty yards away and you pitch it?  And the next guy goes with another pitch?? They going for a music city miracle.. why?!
MacJones trying to tackle at the end lmfaooooo this dude so bad
Who tf even goes for a lateral in a tie game situation? 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Colts blowing a 33-0 lead or this ending? Decisions!
Win or lose Raiders for life😁
You know how you tell yourself not to do something really stupid.  And the next thing you know, you are doing said thing?  Yea...
As a West Coaster watching this game in a bar in Boston, I could not stop laughing at that ending ...
That stiff arm on Jones was a murderer "Chris Smoove voice" lol 😆
I'm a raiders fan and no lie that touchdown wasn't a TD his toe was out I'm starting to think everything is scripted nowadays
Why go to overtime  pats are just bad decisions for this year
Thank you raiders - Sincerely, the 6th chargers fan.
That last play was beyond dumb. As much money as these players are making they should never do anything that dumb. That guy on the patriots team that threw that last pass to the Raiders should be cut from the roster. These are not High School players there should be consequences for poor performance.
NFL is rigged
Literally handed the raiders a W!!! Wow how caring its the holiday season of giving 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love the look on Bill Belichick's face right at the end there
Blown out of bounds call on purpose? As stupid as the play was, it never should've happened.
Mac Bledsoe getting trucked.
Should have took it to overtime congratulations Las Vegas raiders 💯👀
That first New England def TD was like every madden screen pass in madden. Good to see it translates to the nfl
after several "heartbreaking" losses this year we as Raiders fans needed one to finally end in our favor
bill belicheck sucks he just your aveage coach
This ending is very reminiscent of the Miami miracle!
Football IQ 0
Are we gona ignore that fact that the raiders again gave up another big second half lead and did nothing all half until scoring TD to tie the game?
People saying the play was dumb altough it really wasnt. because mac handed it off everyone would majority would have gone to the patriots rb, only reason the plan didnt work is bc the pick was a bad throw
All the years of watching the NFL, I never saw that happen. Wow!!
That was worse than the saints missed field goal
I keep trying to figure out what the flag was...illegal man downfield because all the O-line was running down the field? Roughing the passer even though Jones wasn't the QB at that point....the league desperately trying to figure out how to help the patriots ye again?  Or maybe it was on the Patriots for being that goddamn dumb
Fantastic Raiders!!!
I do NOT know where drew that up. Raiders still alive, barely!
What a finish!!! I absolutely hate new England they almost always have a 4 leaf ☘️ ducked taped to every play and seem to get not 1 or 2 lucky bouncing balls but 4 or 5 every half 🤔 to watch the end of the game makes me all fuzzy inside its about time the Brady Era is at its end iv suffered year after year watching this team rack in super bowl after super bowl 🏈 it all started for me in Medford Oregon when I watched the tuck rule game !!!! Hall of fame Charles Woodson got Tom To Many Trophy 🏆s Brady
Bill wanted to pull out his own 'Miami Miracle' and did the' New England Nuke'.
why would you be trying to do the "no time left lateral play" when you're not LOSING?! just let it go to OT!
What a joke...what an idiot....Patriots deserve to lose this
Dude needs to be fired 😂😂😂😂😂
so happy for chandler jones... showing us why we signed him
People talk about the last play...but  3rd and goal from the 1 and Mac Jones blew the play AND a gasket afterwards   Block punt with under 2 minutes in 2nd qtr led to a Raider touchdown.  Db didn't turn his head around in the endzone for the Raider touchdown pass.  But that last play..  Situational football.    Bonehead
I thought a raider hater said sum
I could watch this over and over again all day what a beautiful sight
The way jones stiff arms him at the end 😭😂
Backup rb strong looks good
Atleast we got a defense. Dodger is a beast. Love watching my guy play
RAIDERS👋😀✔️🤟
Raider Nation
What noone is saying and shame on me for peeing on the parade - but Chandler Jones missed the tackle and got up and stood there.  HE didn't pursue the play.  Course it turned out ok - but he should not have been standing there to make the catch.  Also  - watch what happens to the dude that threw the lateral.  Max Crosby drills him and knocks him into an ass backwards somersault. Hilarious!  Odd win but I'll take it!
what a gift!
Is Bill Bellichick wanting out of New England?  Is he planning to take his talents somewhere else?
its not the best season from new england
Oh my me.  I don't know what.  I gonna blame coaching.  Nauseous.  Mac!  Make a tackle!
This is professional sports.  That was just Bush League.
Oh my God. Glad I wasn't in that locker room when Bill got there.
tough loss
Wow Best weekend of football EVER
That Patriot dumb cluck just made the highlight reel for dumbest laterals in NFL history.
It's about time Raiders won a close one on luck! But why?? Pat's made the most idiotic, inexplainable call with this play!  Why the latterals?? it's a tie game...go figure..smh...but thanks! lol #RN4L 🤍🖤🤍
I've just seen Carrs replacement,  great touchdown pass!
Mai vista una cosa così assurda!!
Mac Jones bugs me. We need someone more pocket tough.
JR Smith be laughing right now....
Why not just play for OT
11:13 Number 10 for the Patriots falls down before he is touched by anyone. Shows you how fixed these games are....LOL
Reggie miller has good commentary
Note to self...Check the scoreboard before each play.
Jakobi Meyers should be fined and benched for the rest of the season for that bonehead move. You don't do that when you're TIED!!!!!!!
Josh Allen would have made the tackle, just sayin lmao
Josh McDaniels-<am I really blew that Rams game with stupid decisions in the end. Belichick...Stand aside, young Jedi while I play 4-d chess
Thank you for mixing us up with the thumbails and the real winner if thw game....now the highlights are nail biters
Belichick and Brady are having the worst seasons of their careers
Football games are a lot harder to win if you’re not cheating as patriot fans have now come to find out
That last play of the game where the Jones intercepts the ball and has his two teammates behind him (kind of an entourage) reminds me of the play from the SF/GB divisional game where SF blocked the punt and Hufanga ran it back for a touchdown. He has about five players right behind him.
@11:45 imagine if the flag was thrown on the field and the ref called for roughing the QB ...The touchdown would not stand.
Chandler Jones always being a good player and the pats let him go. He read the play pretty well🤣 I don't who came up with this play but they are at fault for this lost
Mac Jones on that last play laying down like it’s nap time lol
And... on the trading block today...
Brady and Josh McDaniels are coming back next year
Somebody gonna get cut.
Wtf was that player thinking 😫😫😫 cut him right away
Do not do drugs.....lol
That, STIFF ARM he put on Mac Jones, was unfair, He face planted him
Mac jones attempt at a tackle was pathetic
Mac Jones has got to go.  That duck on the first drive of the second half when the guy was blocked says a lot about who is responsible for the sacks.    He is a sack machine.  No pocket presence, no arm.
Pat Mcaffee is happy now that this is the #1 worst play of all time.
Wow, the smartest most cutting edge team in the game..we’ve been reduced to this. TOM COME HOME, we miss you. 😢
Did coach pencil call that play?
The look on Belichick’s face is priceless
That stiff arm lol
Raiders beat Patriots. Revenge of 2020 😈
As a Raider fan I am happy they won. I am not happy with the defense that gave up 21 unanswered points. The same defense that couldn't tackle a crash dummy. Carr made a very poor choice with that throw early in the game where he was picked off and the Patriots scored. The last pass of the touchdown drive where he threw it in the in-zone was perfect though. The team needs to be rescued though. Mark Davis needs to clean house this off-season starting with the coach. Though I love Carr, it may be team to move on from him similar to SF getting rid of Garoppolo. At least SF has two young QBs they can work with. I'm not sure who the Raiders have. In my opinion they got really lucky pulling off the win.
This would be an hilarious dream come true if I hadn't chosen the Pats to win in my pick 'em league.  Nah, who am I kidding, it was hilarious. 😂😂
Craziest ending I’ve ever seen bruh
Just to state the obvious, that's the stupidest football mistake I've seen in a Loooong time.  🏈😒
Mac Jones stinks. As a Pats fan, I'd rather have almost any other starting QB in the league than him. They are also one of the worst coached teams in the NFL this year. Patricia needs to go ASAP.
Wow how dumb how bad can you possibly be omg lol 😲 😆
I'm a die hard raider and a win is a win but I think the Patriots did it on purpose. My opinion.
😂
I'm shocked 😳
The NFL is as real as Hulk Hogan and Company. What an embarrassment!!!!!
Matt Patricia should be fired and never coach in the NFL ever again. Horrible play call. Take a knee and go to ot.
I never ever seen such an idiot like Meyers ...
May I throw up now?
Just wondering if both the Sox and the Pat's owners decided together to cash in their chips and sell off the assets.
☠️☠️☠️☠️
Why would an NFL player make a play like that? Take the game to OT, and there is no need to hit a homerun.
Super fixed lol
We never had the suicide play in our playbook in high school football.
Meyers needs to get cut🖕🏼
NE's season is over... Two average teams making above average mistakes and du mb plays.
Now he knows he gonna find a new team now right?!?😂😂
Have spontaneously laughed out loud more this season than watching any and all other types of media combined. Very entertaining year.
Wow. This guy with the 1 bit brain should go into the Guiness book. Anyway, it's nice to see the Patriots to lose.
김민준 아나운서 한숨 아니 빡치는 소리가 보인다 보여…
This is a Bobby Bouche moment 😂
To be Honest as a Die Hard Raider Fan New England didn't stand a whatsoever Shot Raiders have Ultimate Win win win blood vs Patriots from that Snow Game Woodson Fumble Stolen Win Way way back lol hehe Patriots are just a Latent Team that the Raiders have on The iiish List of many Hehe Great Win "this is for the Woodson Fumble,Jones stiff arm on QB 💪!!!
Bruh☠️
I thought I was watching an episode of the Twilight Zone...
Who he throw it to...his cuddy?
There is a reason why 10:18 is not repeated. Poor rigged NFL.
Amazing how terrible the NFL has become . It's a Garbage league.
Ive been a Pats fan for 40 years...this is the most Bush league play ever....congrats!
Man what a dumb thing to do, he really forgot to put his noggin on this morning when he woke up LMAO 🤣
what an ending....I guess he thought he was Deion Sanders with the lateral....I'm not sure what was more entertaining, the ridiculous lateral or the stiff arm to McCorkle.. Looks like Pats will be sitting home watching playoffs....Go Bills!!!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. A lot of quiet NE fans these last 2 years. #retireBillB
National Fixed League these games are rigged
Does anyone in the NFL know how to tackle anymore? 😠
wow
Ouch
The most epic dumbest loss in all time
Who thought that dumb play was a good idea never seen a play so stupid.🤣😂🤣😂
Don't know if I should be happy. Josh is getting out coach. Never makes adjustments after halftime.  Arizona,  titans, colts and the lambs ( I mean the Rams) all those games the Raider should if won. But Josh made no adjustments.  Please, get a new coach! Josh sucks
Wtf did I just witnessed
That stiff arm to Mac Jones😈
Matt Jones with the weakest attempt at a tackle I've ever seen in my life, NFL or otherwise.
That is the Patriot's Most Embarrassing Ending Ever! That was the Unexpected Win for the Raiders. UNBELIEVBLE!
Hahaha 😆 lmao....
Jesus is Lord
How..🤦🏾
I'm surprised Belichick didn't cut that guy in the locker room. lol
🤦‍♂️ man just kick the field goal
Patriots really Chargered tf outta that. Signed, A Charger Fan
The Patriots should have just run out the clock and go into OT. Embarrassing way to lose.
Did I just this happen? Immaculate receipt number 2? Wow , Bill must be chewing those players out! Bit when he faces the media,  "yes that was play". What you want me to say.. in a low voice. Lol classic ending
Did the Pats think they were losing?
The same guy that missed the tackle on the run was the same one that got the lateral pick😊 there was no time left the lateral was all they had after that or could've called a hail mary ,congrats raiders
On that last play, it was kind of a late hit even though the passer was no longer the quarterback.  Should a foul have been called?
That Keelan Cole catch was omg
Stanford band is nowhere in sight! LOL
Mac got a stiff arm from the arm of Ogun
I love sports bruh
Dumbest play of the year!!!!
Bro that stiff arm was disrespectful
I now refer to this boring sport as European Soccer.  Absolutely nothing about this waste of time made me feel anything like FOOTBALL makes me feel for life!!!! And as far as European Soccer goes.....meh.  rigged.
Told mac to sit the f down 😂
Bro had no gass left for overtime, he wanted it to end then end there lol
Jakobi Meyers gonna have to find a place to stay in Vegas, they leaving his ass there 😂
Rhamondre Stevenson after the game: “I think the coaches gave us a play just to kind of run the time out, just get down.."  How about a hail mary or kneel.....  What the infinite @!@k was NE thinking...
That patriots locker room had to be a scary after the game 😭
As a Pats fan... all i could do was stare at the screen with my mouth open. Disbelief. And anger. Lots of anger.
I’m so tired of the NFL targeting the Raiders with Penalties so they lose games, they don’t even try to hide it anymore, I’m bout to stop watching the NFL cause of it turning into wrestling no offense to the fans of that
🥱 another rigged NFL game
As a Jets... Bless you, Raiders! The Pats deserved every bit of this fashion of a loss! Thought you were going to OT huh??? NOPE! SUCK IT!! Wonderful!
That TD at the end was out of bounds but the NFL is rigged and payback for the "Tuck Rule" game is now even. Hopefully now Raider fans can stop crying every time the subject comes up.
If I was Bill I would have gotten on the bus and left the whole team behind!
Might be the craziest and dumbest ending in NFL history.
I wonder what that locker room conversation was like 😆
As a raiders supporter ... we are trash
That ending was so dumb I lost brain cells witnessing it
So THIS is the game everyone has been talking about! OMFG!!! Only in Las Vegas! Am I right? ♠️♥️♣️♦️
Do people here not understand football? "They were in field goal range."  No they weren't, they were at their own 45 (a 65+ yard FG). By the time they got into realistic field goal range, time had expired, and there can be no play afterwards.
Staying in the game. It isn't over till it's over and Raiders Defense showed that. A punt was even blocked today, noted. Keep that same energy, its Steelers Christmas Eve, LFG! A silly mistake made by the Pats pitching back instead of going into OT and Vegas capitalized on it. Just win, Baby!
Thank U Commentators , U made the game even Better !!,🏈🏈👍
Who in their right mind would throw that
This is just as bad a loss, if not worse than the loss to the Dolphins with all the laterals by Miami to win on the last play of the game
The whole division won today (AFC west) The South divisions 1-3 each (only won by last pace Saints ⚜️ and the jags with the biggest upset of the week)
Can't be worse than the Colts
bro...why juggle the ball around and not kick a damn FG...what the hell was that play 💀
Help me out here , why no field goal attempt?
Mac Jones was the last hope to stop the Raiders and instead he got pushed like a Target shopping cart on Black Friday
Run out of bounds, kick the field goal, win the game.   Oh, sorry, wrong game, never mind. 🤦
Mac Jones is horrific
Fix games🤣🤣
This is when after the game in the patriot’s locker room you whoop whoever lateral that football like a idiot 🤣😂
MIND=BLOWN!!!
Jones got pushed over like a child at the end
Tbh Mac Jones had an opportunity to bring chandler Jones down I'm sorry I know he ain't a defensive player but that effort to bring Jones down when your team needed it was so pathetic.A little touch on the head and he fell down reason like this are why I can never say a qb can be the greatest football player ever because most quaterbacks are straight up p***y's
I've been saying this for years people...this game is rigged.  No question.
Couldn’t help but chuckle at the end there
Another example of how Jones is not patriots future so many fans have left patriots because of this average guy
Patriots coach is fire hot!!!!!😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
What's wrong with the raiders. U got devantae Adams and u don't have a winning record?
That game was over when the LV receiver caught TD out of bounds.But the Pats guy who threw the pass to Jones of LV gotta get canned.He don't belong in Pros
Da STIFF ARM was" bi!@h move! All i c iz da Nzone"..... Classic ending fi sure...lol
most intelligent patriots play
Truly would love to know if that last play was chalked up like that. 🤯
Mac Jones with zero ounces of athleticism and no ab in sight smoking a cigar at the 45 yard line. #LoveToSeeIt
One of the stupidest and funniest way to win.
But after that  World Cup America Was Like lemme turn the sliders up😂
I'm assuming that #16 was not allowed on the team plane back to NE.🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mac Jones is a QB bib he needs to be tackling tires for a week bc that was a horrible attempt
The Las Vegas Miracle.
The reverse Stanford band play.
That flag after the game-winning touchdown was hilarious
They were already in FG range when they decided to pitch it back wtf was that ? They literally GAVE us that win but I’ll take it lol
Top 10 dumbest plays in history.   They were in FG range, Stephenson just had to go out of bounds.
What the hell???😅
Meyers placed a bet on the raiders
Great play by Jones. Not to put a damper on it but why was Chandler 20 yards behind the play rather than chasing the opponents down?
I try not to let sports games effect my mood through out the day but this really messed up my night bad this one hurt
FIXED !!!! LEAGUE
Patriots are the worst team ever with 0 seconds on the clock (Miami Mirracle)
I had to stair at the score for like 2mins str8 to make sure the score didn't change 24/24  nope not a mistake it's right this beats Seahawks play against them
🤷🏿‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's your lolcow of the week
Incredible ending
NE coach- “ lets surprise the whole world and make history with this amazing play! “  Raider— “Yes”
What was he thing about?
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ??? LV WINS , UNBELIEVABLE
how can you not show the replay of the Cole TD??????   dude was out of bounds (not a Patriot fan)
As a Raider fan I’m actually just glad someone out did us in being dumb
Belichek owed Josh for turning down the Colts with Luck at QB to stay OC of Patriots. Josh needs wins to keep his job. Beating NE is still a big deal.
The pats season was doomed the minute they replaced zappe with mac the mistake.  Hopefully, they'll release jones in the offseason and our 2 year nightmare can come to an end.
The Patriots were playing with loser mentality. You can definitely tell by that last play 🤣
I think two brains short-circuited on the last play: Mac Jones' brain, and the ref's brain.   Jones froze like a statue, and the ref threw a flag for no apparent reason.
Wally likes the Padres more than raiders 😮
Go to 11:12 and watch at one-quarter speed for a good laugh.  "Uh oh" - LOL.
I'm a Pats fan and my Dad is a Raiders fan. My Dad passed away 10SEP. I'm glad the Raiders won. I'm sure he's happy up there in Heaven.
Raider nation  Good for the win Good pass pressure  but that pick six and the run defence
This is a great time to be a football fan
That was the dumbest ending Ivv ever saw and Im a Lion fan...
Really dumb move by Jakobi Meyers, maan. And Mac Jones is too soft.
“Never interrupt the enemy while he’s making a mistake.”                                              Napoleon
New England Raiders 😂
Wtf was that
He literally threw the game away
THAT BOY BELLICHIK HEATED
Ha ha ha
Whyyyy? Like time had ran out but its a tie game why the hell are they lateraling for?
And here I am, mad that C. Jones missed that tackle. I guess I DONT know football.
They were in field goal range!
Well that was painful to watch.
HA!!
You big dummy 🤣😂🤪🤦🙄😭🤣
WTF?!
In the 30 years I have been watching the NFL I have never seen such a stupid mistake in basic football fundamentals. I really want to thank Bill and the Patriots for providing the silliest way to loose a game ever. I literally fell out of my chair with tears of joy falling down my face. Way to go Bill, another complete an absolute failure, for all those bandwagon Patroit fans to cry and write a song about missing Tom Brady, hahaha. I love seeing these fools all depressed Monday morning at dunkin donuts.
Watch Mac Jones on that last play... He can never live that down. Good God Almighty... 🤦🤦‍♂🤦‍♀
Alabama vs. Auburn ending came to mind. Not bad calls. Low risk/game winning reward, but things just went horribly wrong lol
I am loving every millisecond of it!!!!! LOLOLOLOL!!!!!!!!!!
Patriots problem is more about their head coach now than their QB.
Bruh wtf
Wow.  I don't think anybody here knows why the Patriots did such a stupid and foolish thing when the score was tied and they could've fought for the win in overtime.  How embarrassing.  I know I've never seen an ending like that when the score was tied.
I’m thinking maybe, oh I don’t know…OVERTIME!!!!!
Out of bounds right there for a 50 yard try but no lets run 10 yards backwards and throw it to a defender sucks to be a pat fan right now gotta change things and play smarter
The entire world shouts:  "I LOVE IT!"  Nice coaching BIlly B!
Wow what a game, a great game
i alr know bill is heated
patriots what happenduhh
The paw movements tho, like “dad i know i f’d up just calm down everything will be alright” 😂😂
Myers definitely signing with the Las Vegas raiders next season
RAIDERS IMMACULATE RECEPTION!!!!!!
3rd quarter is definitely the Raiders Achilles heel
Soooo... Uhhhh was Raiders previous TD out of bounds? It looked out? Maybe I'm crazy.
This game wasn't thrown at all.
josh mcdaniels is upset because the raiders won lol
Big Bones Jones wins it nice
Always good to see the Patriots lose especially in this embarrassing way 😂
If u all think that ending happened because Rhamondre Stevenson and Jokobi decided to do what they wanted to do, as opposed to the coaches telling them to try some "trick play" /get em while they're not looking bs,, then idk what to tell ya 😂
WTFFFFFFFFFDD
Feels good to get revenge for the tuck rule. Raiders win🏈😉
Umm what? Coles foot was not in bounds that play shouldn't have ever happened. What is going on? How does that TD by Cole stand after reviewing? What is going on?
The Pats plays 🔥🥔& it's Old Man Jones away with a pick 6 & a stiff 💪 to the QB  moving at the least 4.7 speed 😅😅 Go head Man do your thang
I don’t even know if I can necessarily consider this a win for us, because we blew yet ANOTHER double digit lead, and who knows what would’ve happened in overtime.  However, considering all the embarrassing losses we’ve suffered week after week, it’s nice to be on the other side of it, for once. We just benefited off of the Patriots’ stupidity.
Mac Jones was just in the way.
Pats would’ve lost in overtime anyways so I guess it’s good that they just got it over with🤷🏻
Wild ending
Sam Bankman Fried dropping the soap in prison videos brought me here. So Obvious.
Another fixed game lol
As a pats fan I’ve never been more ashamed and embarrassed for a loss like this one how brain dead u have to be to call that play. Sickening to say the least
Lmao lost every ounce of respect for Mac Jones after this.. even with the game on the line #soft .. that might just be the most pathetic attempt at a tackle I’ve ever seen.. & I coach peewee
Glad my Raiders won but this NFL season seems so fake.
Lmao my Raiders finally get a win
That was the funniest $hit ever, oh my gosh. The QB saw tha LB coming at him and  thought he could slide into a tackle.
That's Mad Max 4 Ya 😆👏👏!!! Any other defender that QB is getting 1st Down!! Because the MEATED HEADED defender is over pursuing & The QB out waves him & he gets 1st down
I was so damn angry at Carr! Finally scored in a second half after 5 or 6 straight incompletions! But the legendary stiff arm that put Mack Jones in the dirt!! Is there a better defensive stiff arm touchdown game winner?? Chandler is the man
Jakobi Meyers is the raiders best WR
LOL.  NO replay on the badly officiated TD.  Shocking.
omg did they just really do that?????
Ohh DC4 threw a "Give me that 🏈!! Give U what?!!" Pick 6!! 😆😆!!
That's worst than the Colts giving up a 33-0 lead in my opinion.
Battle of the spygaters.
I never want to see Jakobi Myers take the field for the Patriots again. Man is an utter liability. As for Matt Patricia, he can do one as well.
And that's why Mac jones needs to go.
Does that count as a fumble recovery at the end?
An ABSOLUTE Raiders kind of WIN🎉
worst game ibn the whole nfl
DOnkey of the year award
this is the most raider like thing i've ever seen
THANK YOU NE!  They gave the game away and the RAIDERS gladly took it!
Hunter Henry face says it all 😮.
Bill got that walk at the end like he bought to cut some folks
Man, felt bad for Jacoby Meyers. But felt great for the Raiders. This reminded me of the Holy Roller game in the 70s.
Also chandler Jones looked like t.o's big ass running that in!
Holy Smokes! In all my years of watching football....I have NEVER seen that before! Incredible!
That 40 yard bomb in the bread basket made my dog attack my cat I screamed loud he ran in to protect me and the cat was the only one around lol
Somemore nfl crooked fraud games
U know that guy that threw that ball is getting cut tomorrow
Y'all peep that flag that showed after Chandler's touchdown.. The refs were like flag we had $$$ on this game but what we gonna call without getting caught nvm no flag
*Carl Lewis voice* Uh Oh 11:11
This is like that one punt play with only the snapper near the ball, which just insta-failed.  Holy crap.
11:13 LMFAOOOOO
The stupidest coaching game ever
As a Raiders fan, I don’t know how we didn’t lose this
Крутая игра
It’s funny. The only time the Patriots looked good this season and spirits were high was when Bailey Zappe won them 3 straight games. Then he has a couple of bad drives and they put Mac back in….and that was that for this season.
LMFAO! How stupid can you be? New England...Hold my beer.
Oh wow incredible 🤣😅😂😂😂😂
What the actual f*ck just happened
This is all Mac’s fault, if he could just tackle. Dissapointing
Now I call that kiddie ball!
Revenge for the tuck rule
I NEEEEEED to hear what Bill said at that exact moment they started lateralling
Usually it's the Raiders making those kinds of plays...lol
Oh man, I thought this only happens to the Bills. GO BILLS!!!
How about the Washington WR lining up wrong to cost them the game,,,,, how many dumb plays were there this week?
Why! Dude gets paid hella money and just threw the ball wherever. Come on new England
One of if not the dumbest decisions of all time. You could simulate that last attempt at laterals from that field position 1,000 times and not come anywhere close to the endzone.
Watched this in person and omfg it was insane you want to talk about choking
So everyone is just gonna ignore how the Raiders game tying touchdown was actually out of bounds and refs completely ignored it?
Who got the worse loss? The Cowboys who lost a game being up by 33 or the Patriots by this?
Wow Raiders,  so you're saying I have a chance.  👍🏽
I'm surprised the Raider ran the right way ...
Nothing warms my heart more this holiday season than seeing pissed off, crying patriots fans. About time y’all got some of your own medicine ☠️🏴‍☠️
The patriots are the new Cowboys 🤷🏽‍♂️
Defense finally win the game for the Raiders. Must do a better job .Mr. Carr
I love it. Bill Belechick can eat a bag of dicks!
5:07 Another classic announcer jinx
If I were Bill Belichick, I would leave NE and be the DC at Alabama....
No fucken way they called the last touch down a completion he was literally out of bounds bro this league is bs fake ass scripted ass league no fucken way
Belichek cut him after That dude right after this 😂
Vengeance for the Tuck rule
And that's why the NFL has the Wonderlic test.
There’s something fishy about this outcome
Jim Marshall and Leon Lett are thanking Jacoby Meyers for making this the worst play in NFL history.
this is analogous to a NBA player shooting the ball in the opponent's hoop as time expires to lose the game by a basket. One of the most boneheaded plays in NFL history
The most insane ending in history of the NFL! Thanks patriots for saving my dolphins and still got a shot for playoffs!
I don’t understand the last play, like why on earth would be pull something off like that. I’ll never wrap my head around it.
When theres no time left youll try znything. Why the player threw the ball back about 30 yards does not make sense though. The game was not on the line. It was a tie. Crazy football.
Karma for those past playoff knockouts.
The Pats are in post season form. They are trying everything they can to avoid doing more work in OT.
Why
😂😆😆😆😆😆😆
An early Christmas gift for LV, wrapped conveniently with a black-and-white striped bow.
Another crazy walk off win for Da Raidahs🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
A little karma from the tuck rule game.
Tomorrow's headline: "Jakobi Myers released by New England."
The patriots lost using the raiders way.
I remember when i had my first beer.  🤦‍♀️
A Raiders type of crappy play from Patriots
So the Patriots literally threw the game… It absolutely made no sense but we will take it!
Jones ran over Jones for the winning touchdown.😂
Sweeeet victory pie!
Refs blew that last TD, toe was out of bounds. But yeah to add insult to injury - it was one of those blooper reel plays that all you can do is laugh at and move on.
Rigged...
If Aaron Hernandez was playing he was the best of the best for ever 81🏈♠️💯
This is an early Christmas gift for the Raiders....
That intercepted lateral was symbolic of the pats' playoff hopes. May as well play Zappe the rest of the way.
Haha pats suck
Just win baby !!
Adams, Renfrow and Waller all playing and Keelan Cole and Mack Hollins have the most reception. Money well spent😂
Bruh, wtf... lol ?? Why would u try to lateral that ?? As a die-hard Pats fan this is so disgusting ! Not the Patriot way ! I'm going psycho like Edleman...
Check the morning waiver wire!
Cmon Meyers what was that pass... U threw it to jones like he was the WR
on the behalf of the Ravens, thank you Vegas
Last play looked rigged, why not just go to overtime? Raiders couldn't stop the run
These were typical plays you would see from the Raiders in the 1960s and 70s.
i cannot wait to watch pat mcafee tomorrow is all imma say lmao
Why the hell don’t you just go to OVERTIME!!! What the hell are you doing!!!
Imagine how mad belichek was in the locker room
number 16 is that you JR smith?
The stiff arm heard around the NFL✓
To all my Raiders nation we won!
It wasn't the dude that did the lateral, it was the second dude who tried to throw back.
this is like a jr smith type play
The Patriots deserved this
11:00 #1 C'mon Moment Of All Time. 🤣
This year has been great. Sad it's almost over. Playoffs are gonna be nuts
You BLOCKHEAD.......
The new catch phrase, for someone doing something dumb, they Pulled a patriots.
That sad part about this play is that if Mac Jones gets benched after this game that stiff arm will haunt him for the rest of his life
This is more impressive than the Vikings comeback!
As a chargers fans, thank you vegas
Nice to see the old Billy Sullivan owned Patriots back. There was no better group of sad sacks and those bums. I hope they're back to stay
patriots...what the heck was that last play??🤣
So happy this isn't the Lions anymore 🤣🤣🤣
WOW The ending was NUTS 🤯
Someone may be out of a job
Não entendi nada
A reminder that the Patriots organization needs a whole reset from the coaching to the players on the offensive side. Bill needs to be on the hot seat for such a terrible team he has coached.
How much money did he lose the night before in vegas
The NFL is starting to look more and more like it’s fixed
Belichick's one step closer to quitting his job after this game😄🔥💀
Both of those players, will be cut from the team, it’s a tie game wtf were y’all doing go down! We still had a chance in overtime 😂
Jesus, the sorry ass Raiders caught the BIGGEST break in NFL history. On another note, this may be Belichicks last season as head coach.
What the hell were the Patriots thinking?  That was an early Christmas present for the Raiders.  Doesn’t make up for the Immaculate Reception or the BS tuck rule for Raider Nation but it’s a start.
Just when you think you've seen them all.........up pops a fresh one.
Patriots out Raidered the raiders!🤣
Lmfao! Brady would never!!
If Bill Buckner was a patriot...
This in NO WAY makes up for the BS tuck rule game but it's a nice early Christmas present for the Raiders. (Lord knows they NEED it!)
Still doesn't make up for the Tuck...but Patriots fan If you wanna make up for the Tuck in small payment installments like this for the rest of your existence...fine...payment accepted.
The first guy is just as guilty. They weren’t losing.
WOW , I HATE THE RAIDERS,  BUT THEN SUDDENLY I DIDN'T,  AND THEN I RETURNED TO REALITY AND HATED THEM AGAIN..BUT DO YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE PATRIOTS ARE THAT BRADYLESS THEN YES.. GOOD GAME FOR THE RAIDERS..DARE I SAY THAT 👏 😉
Fun Fact: the raiders receiver was clearly out on the TD catch to tie the game. I am not what the review people were looking at....
Hoodie just LOST HIS MIND
If you can't see that's scripted and rigged you are totally indoctrinated and brainwashed.
Sit down mac Jones.
WTF was THAT! Damn, play for the OT
Right now, Bill Buckner is laughing his ass off.
That has to be Belichick's lowest low.
Wow worst tackle ever Daniel. Looked like he gave up
The last 30 sec was Epic 🤯🤦🏾‍♀️
That’s what you call handing them the win
Mac Jones - worst tackle attempt of all time. *He's not the guy.
As a chargers fan… thank you so much raiders
Stupid Patriots 🤣🤣🤣🤣
An INSANE ENDING to this game. 30-24 Raiders!!!
I feel sick for number 11. If there ever was a "you cost us the gane" this is it.
Six Super Bowls, has come to this...
Well at least they didn't blow a 33-point lead.
The Colts …. 😥 😰 😅
If he doesn't get the stiff arm, then game goes into OT and Raiders lose.
Ive always heard about the "most raiders way to lose" but this has to be the most raiders way to win.
Man I bet your ass Bill is PISSSSSSSED 🤣  for a guy that likes smart football they played pretty dumb today.
NEW ENGLAND JETS!!!    lifelong pats fan and this just blows my mind!!
Just got back from the game, ears still ringin. I was sitting in section 127, row 13, thats the end zone where Joes scored the winning D. Crazy!
Pats Offense play calling was terrible again!!   I kept yelling pass 15 to 20 yd plus.  How many times did they do that 2-3 times, and got big gains.  Stop w the  dump off garbage for 2-3 yds or negative yards.  Mac Jones isn't too good throwing out to the sideline.   How many passes did he throw too high or overthrow too long?   Also it seems like he's locked in on the primary receiver on the play and is unable to look off and around and see other receivers who are standing there wide open.
What an incredible weekend to be a Football and Football fan. The Saturday NFL games were incredible then the World Cup final game was unbelievable and then the Sundays scheduled NFL games were riveting.   NFL needs to get rid of the Thursday games and have it added to the Sunday schedule.
This time the Patriots looked like the Raiders last week!!🤣🤣🤣 Dumb and Dumbest!!🤣😛😛 Josh McDooDoo was going to set another faiders record for losing another game when they are ahead or winning but the Patriots gave the faiders a sorry win!!😵‍💫😵
Yikes
As a Raider fan for life this was the most awesome ending to watch
The Patriots deserve to ride the short bus back to Foxboro for this
Crooked as league how did coles td stand. It was nice but still clearly out of bounds.
Wow. Are you f****** kidding me. This is the first thing all season that has fully made me start to question Bill Belichick's job safety, despite all the... interesting decisions Bill has made. Let's get one thing clear: Bill Belichick is STILL a top 5 coach in the league who is somehow keeping this talent lacking team in the playoff hunt. He is STILL a good GM and drafter. He is the greatest coach AND GM in the history of the league. Bringing in Matt Patricia and Joe Judge to run his offense? A stupid decision, yes, but not something that would put his job in jeopardy considering he has great ties with them both. The real thing is that this team is just stupid. As Zolak said on the call this might be one of the dumbest teams I've ever seen. Belichick has been praised for leading 2000IQ teams, with smart savy football players who make gutsy and clutch plays. If this is any other coach's team their job is immediately questioned. Bill Belichick is the only thing keeping us slightly relevant, but that doesn't mean we won't decide to axe him for stuff like this.
I would NOT like to be an employee of BB for the next couple of days…
I don't want to say they are fixing games but how else do you explain this
Anyone see the PI at the 5 minute mark?
Lol Mac jones really thought he was going to tackle a defensive player who tackles for a living that stiff arm was to easy
Someone's getting cut
1.6K comments so fast, yikes!!
So stupid.....
After 20 years, they finally have their revenge for the Tuck Rule.
That is the single stupidest thing I've ever seen, glorious x)
Dude thought he was in NFL street
Just seems too rigged
Guaranteed, Belichick had nothing to do with that horrible play.
11:11 they really just did that, could’ve gone to OT 😐😂
that had to be the dumbest thing ive seen in 2022. Thank you Patriots
What's a week
Makes it so much sweeter knowing this happened to Belichick's team.
As a charger fan ....THANK YOUU PATS & RAIDERS!! Lol You know damn well that the absolute last coach  on Earth you could possibly make THAT EMBARRASING GAME-LOSING  BLUNDER under is with bill bellichick. Lmao theyr running gassers for sure monday
Why didn’t the Pats just knee Im this and go to OT?  The lateral made no sense.
Patriots should be ashamed of themselves smh idk what y’all was doing 🤷🏾‍♂️
Jesus how many 2 TD leads have the raiders blown this season. Terrible 2nd half coaching.
Why??? 🤣Oh well...thanks Pats. From a grateful Bolts fan.  I can't stop laughing at the stupidity of that play🤣
I see more than 12 persons play for LV in the last run!😄
Exactly one week from the 50th year anniversary of the immaculate reception the raiders finally get even lol.
RRRRRRAAAAAAAAIIIIIIDDDDEEERRRRSSSSSSS!! shoukd of left it on Sunday night oh well take that L nfl!!
Wow
That fool Jakobi Meyers ain't nothin but a big ol' dummy head.
Hey 50 yard field goal attempt or should I just throw the game away
ive been watching nfl here in toronto since the late 70's, and that has to be the FUNNIEST PLAY i have ever seen!!! the last Patriots player who was just bowled over had me splitting my gut!!!
Remember last season when the chargers called a timeout that allowed the raiders to make a field goal that eliminated them when they could of just opted for the tie…… this might just be worse than that
Wow there's been some crazy endings to these games this year
Refs really switched up since Brady left 🤣
We almost Mcdanield this game again. I'm happy the Pat's Macdanield this game for us.
Now that was mess up, and they call them professionals?
These Patriots look like they’re actively trying to lose. That last drive was pitiful even before the lateral. At this point, they should just forfeit the rest of the season and save us all the embarrassment in the playoffs.
I’m a commentary lmao love it Raidersss
Lol 🤣
Wow
patriots are just not a good team.
Definitely gonna be on C’mon Man!! 😂
WTF 😱
Looks like they took pass interferences out of the NFL today. It was bad.
Looked staged
Refs have absolutely called the worst games of all time this weekend.  They just had a no call in the end zone on a PI that should have qualified more as a freaking ASSAULT.  Unbelievable how bad the refs were all weekend.  Literally decided the fate of several games because of such bad calls.    Unreal how the Raiders got that TD with the front of his foot clearly on the white.  How in the absolute hell do you have to be so blind to not see that?  And then the Giants defender all over the Washington receiver in the endzone?  Basically bear hugged him the entire play and got away with it?  Are you kidding me?       Not even a fan of any of the teams, but I'm more of a fan of refs not deciding games.    It doesn't matter what the Stevenson did on the Patriots.
That was truly pathetic.
And the Patriots are terrible again...
Payback play for tuck rule back in 2002 AFC Title Game
11:11 bro, really turned around and look straight at Chandler Jones and threw it at him…. The NFL is scripted and rigged never watching another NFL game again and if you can’t see what I’m seeing your a blind sheep…
The Patriots could never say “It could be worse” ever again after this L.
That last play reminded me of the Waterboy when he gave the guy the ball just so he could drop kick him in the end zone
Bro imagine shaking the other team hand after that 😂😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣
………… What the actual heck… was that…
I guess the Patriots are on to Cincinnati😅
Like my dad said…sometimes you miss playing in High School 😂😂😂
They could've literally just taken a knee and gone into ot lol
He literally throws it right to him so they can win the Game. Its because I put money on the Patriots
The stiff arm on Jones LOL
Just when you keep thinking you've seen it all in the NFL the patriots do this lol
+What the F were the Pats doing ?  GO RAIDERS !!!
What the hell are you doing?!
How pathetic. Odds are he played junior, high school, college and now the pros and that is his mentality????
*Not so fun fact* Jakobi Meyers threw more TD's today than Mac Jones did
Belichick about to pull a Stalin and purge his own team
WHY DIDNT WE TAKE IT TO OVER TIME!! WTF
If this doesn't prove that the NFL is rigged, nothing does!
Now that's funny what a way too end it.
Simply…. What in the hell are you doing??? THE GAME IS TIED!!!! Your not losing!!!!!! THE GAME IS TIED!!!!! WHY TF R YOU TOSSING IT AROUND….. GO TO OVERTIME!!!!!! GO TO OVERTIME!!!
Damn. Should’ve just went to OT Pats 😔
Even a 12 year old girl scout would have put up more than a fight than Mac Jones did as the last man *GIRL* standing
Several people mention the "Tuck rule" and comparing it to this play, NOTHING more distant to reality, I am 100% sure that Raiders would have won the Super Bowl that year, it is really ridiculous that wins and losses get decided not by the players but by public relationships and who is in a position of power, ALL the players and coaches knew that was a fumble, everybody, the Referee that officiated that game never did a Raiders game again but 17 for the Patriots, I hope something like this never happens again...
Oh my lord!  What a finish!!!!
As a Ravens fan, I thought WE had the dumbest offensive play calling in the NFL. Thanks NE for proving me wrong
Hahahahahahah wow
Wow that was stupid!😱
patriots suck lol
... that stiff arm on Mac Jones was hilarious....
Damn! Raiders are going to the playoffs! 🤣🤣🤣
This is for sure going to be a storyline going into the immaculate reception commemoration game this Saturday!
RRRRRRAAAAAAAAIIIIIIDDDDEEERRRRSSSSSSS!
How are you going to start lateraling the ball when its a tie game?  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️.  That’s some pretty dumb players or bad coaching or both.
Immaculate reception, Tuck Rule, Index Card 1st down vs Dallas, for once the Raiders were on the winning end of a ridiculous, absurd, once in a lifetime play it feels like God gave Raider Nation a Christmas miracle for all the stuff we have been through.
Wait !! Wait !! there is a flag !!  Here 's the call :  "...the calling on the field is Stupidest play of the year ...number 16 .... Offense .... touch down Las Vegas ....  game is over ...... Go back to New England  .   Game over .
Purposely thrown right to the Defender
Trash Product. Lying to People. Not even Real. WWE fake product. Scripted Product. They make the other team win as soon as you put big money on 1 team. Have Proof
That scream at the end & Belichick made my day
Had this been a Sunday or Monday Night game there would have been a sideline angle clearly showing the top third of Keelan Cole's cleat out of bounds in the end zone. The NFL has unlimited financial resources and pays lip service to ensuring the highest quality officiating, but inexplicably provides fewer cameras to regional broadcasts as if these games don't carry huge post-season ramifications.
Worst part is they didnMt even have to go for that lateral play
“It’s picked off!”  ..that was thrown right to the defender.  Picked off is a bit of a stretch. 😅
If Mahomes had the talent on this Raiders offense, he'd throw 5 TD's a game. Carr is trash
I'm glad the Raiders beat the Patriots..I dont have to watch my Pat's anymore this season. It was like a diseased horse that had to be put down. Mac Jones gotta go
Why the hell didn’t they just play for over time.
Pats should have " tucked" it. 😆
Wtf!?
I'm tired of the Mac Jones defenders. The guy sucks. He's one of the worst starting QBs in the league. Can't even score a TD.
WTF OMG
FLAG? Did someone just accidentally press the flag button because this play will be known as the worst play in NFL history?
Karma for the Tuck Rule 2001 !!!!!!
as a raiders fan this is crazy thank you patriots for the W
Anybody else hear Tom Brady laughing after that last play it was louder than mine 😂
Did thay just win the super bowl what 🤡 Thay are the champions amazing 😍
What was belichick thinking running that stupid lateral play as the clock ran out? That was very unpatriotic of him. All you chowder heads are crying in your chowder today lol. Cry chowderheads cry
That Kyle Dugger TD was an awesome read. He saw that coming the whole way
11:44 I love watching Belichick be embarrassed.
*OMG!!!!* *What an ending!!!!* *WE FINALLY BEAT THE PATRIOTS!!!!* *FIRST TIME SINCE 2002!!!!* *THIS WIN IS SOOO SWEET!!!!* *Merry Christmas, Raider Nation!!!!* *Let’s get a dub VS. our hated Rival Pittsburgh Steelers on Christmas Eve!!!!*  RRRRAAAIIIDERRRRSSSS!!!!!
Probably the dumbest play I've seen.
Insanity prevails again !!
I just came for the last play😂😂😂
Yall are so fake. I really thought the NFL was Real all this time but it's a lie. It's Rigged. Yall really went the other way when I put money for the Patriots. WWE fake sh.... Bunch of liars not a Real Game.
Wait what !
Patriots deserve this for all the cheating the coach does on  a weekly basis!!!  Lmfao!!!
I feel like we were doing so much better w zappe
Payback for the Snow Bowl Tuck Ruling?
Now that was nice pass to Raiders Defense 😂
BB exposing himself as a clown coach lol
@2:34 Mac Jones hahaha pouts like a six year old ...
Raiders always give us the most crazy games winning or losing
This just confirms to me that the NFL has to be scripted, there's no way that play at the end could be real
That guy who threw the backward pass is getting CUT tomorrow morning.
This win was for the tuck rule 🤣🤣🤣
The patriots offense bet on the raiders
Every week is another heart attack, another spike in blood pressure. Thank you Raiders.
Patriots needed to hurry up and get to the airport, ain’t nobody got time for overtime! 😂😂
As a raiders fan the past week was rough to watch and this week was looking to be the same. Nearly blew the lead. But glad the nation got the W.
Another Derek Carr comeback. 👍
Bill Belichick is going to fire someone tonight 😂😂
Really? WTF was that?!!! WHY?!!!!!!!!! 😡
Every game that Patriots lose is just a fantastic game. I really admire Raiders players for that successful comeback.
Holy College Bowl Batman!!
11:00 This play will definitely make the New England and NFL all time biggest blunders highlight reels from now on.
Can we all appreciate the fact that that first of two raiders touchdowns in the last 30 seconds was not a touchdown in any way you look at it?
Brady made the Pats.. not Belecheck
As a Buffalo Bills fan, I can't lie to you, I am LMAO.
Fuckn patriots mess up again ! Can't believe my team ! Idiots !
Don’t forget the time the Dolphins did a Stanford bandplay and scored on the patriots. Gronk was the safety valve but got burned by Kenyan Drake
it’s the best week of the season and most importantly the best football week ever. Games are mostly ended by comeback.
Never shouldve come to that cuz the tying td shouldnt have stood clearly out of bounds so the nation got two gifts today to bad it wasnt a playoff game that led to a superbowl championship and the birth of a dynasty
What was that? Only the Raiders can win like this! Bill Bellycheck's face says it all! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Nuff Said!
That stiff arm from Jones on jones was beastmode status. #RaiderNation
I’m a raiders fan frl but hm the raiders pay the refs😹😹
Mac jones is ass
the look of disbelief or disdain on Belichick's face is hilarious
Why throw up a pass like that? smh. Go to overtime and see if you can win it there. What an ugly way to lose a football game Pats. Bill B must have been furious after watching that non-sense play at the end.
Bill gonna b pissed off 😤
Mac Jones continues to impress
Bill Belichick during the press conference after the game: “on to Miami”….
It's about time something goes right for the raiders....
It's the Vegas magic show! Expects the unexpected!😄
Any loss by New England is a good loss. But this had to be one of the best. Still laughing.
"C'mon Man"
Jakobi Meyers: "JONES!!! Here!!!! Forget about OT! Go get a TD!!!"  Chandler Jones: "Okay!"
Bruh LMAO why didn't the Patriots just go to overtime
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 ThX  Patriots I needed that laugh 😅🤣😂😅🤣😂😅🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Looks like a certain organization misses Tom Brady
I'm glad the Patriots lost but they were screwed by the replay judge at the end, the Raiders foot was blatantly out. NFL have conveniently cut it out of the highlights too! If Brady was still in New England that td would've been ruled out for sure...lol
WTF was that. Belichick just imploded.
Did he just have a JR smith moment like didn’t remember the score or wtf happened?
Who Won, I just went to take a WiZ...
This goes to show you, anything can happen in sports, to any team , any given moment. Never count your chickens until they hatch.
Can you imagine being up 24-17 in 4th quarter with 3 mins left and someone telling you in the future you'll lose this game not even going into overtime.
What an idiot
That interception by Dugger  on the quick screen to Adams literally left the announcers speechless. That was an insanely spectacular and well read play and a play of the year contender right there. Having said that, that play at the end was the dumbest and most embarressing play and way to lose that I also have ever seen. What a bonehead move, why throw it back 15 yards to a slow and nonmobile QB. WOW, and after having made such a comeback that could of saved their season cuz the Jets and Dolphins lost this week. I know Bellichec is feeling humiliated right now to see it come to this
The most moronic play ever by a player in the NFL.
6-7
Instant historic ending. Will be on NFL films highlight reels forever.
Could be worse, you could be Matt Ryan.
5-7
Wtf!! Go to OT! Hahahahah
4-7
3-7
Didn't Bill Belichick's teams used to be so smart?   What was THAT we just saw to end the game?  Crazy stupid play.  SMH
2-7
1-7
That guy deserves to be cut.
1-6
1-5
whoever dude was that threw itt...he betta not go in that lockeroom lol bellacheat waitin on him in the tunnel...id find my own flight home...get back b4 them...clear out my locker and then self-admit at psyche ward...and put bellacheat on the no visitor list...im done with the patriots...next time he sees me itll be across the field.
No way some of this s🤣t isn't scripted. To many weird outcomes this week.
1-4
Wtf were the Patriots doing? Go down and go to OT. The game is tied you dumb dumbs.
there wasn't even a patriot where he tossed the ball what was he doing.
0-4
0-3
0-2
0-1
MAC JONES GOT MOLESTED 🙄
What the hell did the patriots just do
Raiders were in complete control of the game until Derek Carr handed the Patriots a way back in (might as well have held up a sign telling the Pats DBs the ball was being thrown to Davonte). But Raiders were saved by the Ref at the end there, it's funny how the refereeing decisions no longer go the Pats way since Brady left them fr fr
Rig I tell yaa!!
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
At 11:12 the raiders player just runs over the quarterback and stiff arms him to the ground like a peasant.
Zappe would of made that tackle. I've seen enough. Start Zappe.
The patriots were like we don’t want OT we’ll rather loose the game in an embarrassing fashion 😂😅😂
Awsome bawhaha and im from new England bawhaha
Bro he was out
I literally yelled no to this for so long on that final play 😅
Anytime Anyway we can get a win vs TB or the Patriots- I’ll take it.  Still sore over the tuck rule game.
The Patriots thought that they could do to the Raiders what the Dolphins did to them in 2018
Mac Jones really 🙄 are you in highschool or the NFL you gotta mk that tackle that was pathetic effort.just stood there and got the worst stiff arm in history
LMAO
Despite the fact that they clearly got screwed on a (non) touchdown review (can anyone take this league seriously at this point?) I'm still delighted to see the Patriots lose in the most pathetic fashion time and again after years of league-manufactured luck. Raiders fans specifically must relish in this ignominious slide into irrelevance. Go Tuck yourselves New England.
That's for that BS tuck rule....ha...
Belicheck is overrated.  It was all Brady.
Why not try a play like that? The pats are not making the playoffs this year. Belichik tried to win the game before over-time. The patriots next opponents are Cincy, Miami and Buffalo with a high probability they lose each game.
UH OW, UH OW, OH  NO, OH WOW, UNBELIEVABLE, INCREDIBLE   Spectacular commentary!!!  Imagine those who were listening screaming "WHAT, WHAT'S HAPPENING?"
That stiff arm at the end tho lol 😂
What a humiliating play for NE.
What an ending.
saw an ad for dawn dish soap saving ducks so at least something positive happened today
as a raiders fan, im bewildered that we not only won, but that we got that last TD to tie the game even tho buddy’s foot was on the line🤦‍♂️ and the fact they even called a play like that while we were tied with 5 seconds is beyond me
Just Win Baby
That’s bs
Hahahahahah comment section
I'm a pats fan and that was so stupid way to give the game away
The 2 cheater "goat" lost today. Love to see it. You know who they are. 😂
That was Great Bill Belichick trick play lost it for him LOL!! Any day the Patriots lose is a good day!!
Nawl bro, just check out the Texans/Kansas City game ending. Today. imma see if i can get my grandfather to quarterback for em next week, I think he'll do a little better.  The NFL has turned into the Keystone Cops show LMAO!!!!
Jakobi Meyers #16 of the Patriots probably wants to change his name and jersey number and hide under a rock! How flippin embarrassing can it get especially since I believe this has never happened in the history of the NFL and the game simply could have went into overtime!! Me and millions of others will never forget and will be talkin bout this one for a long time!!!!
Just Win Baby!!!!!!!!!!
Donkey of the day goes to #pats 🤦🏿‍♂️
That's the most boneheaded cluster $%#@ decision-making during a play I've ever seen.
They showed the losing team with the football in the thumbnail. As far as I know, they've never done that.
I remember Superbowl 2015, Seahawks lost to the Patriots when Russ threw it in and it was picked off for Patriots to maintain their lead… this play against the Raiders was the most satisfying play ever
Was on the 30 , and throws to the ..what 40 50 yard line ?...idk... seems funny.. dude should have kneeled it... Fg .....game..
I think it's safe to say this is the 1st time I've ever seen a wide receiver player throw an interception to a d-lineman
"C'MON MAN"
I wish I could see Bellichick’s reaction during the play
As a Falcons fan, glad we didn’t lose like this 😂
A madden moment lol
In the words of the great Bill King " holy toledo!"
Now if the Raiders had done all those crazy laterals to lose the game ... it would have been kind of a Raider thing to do. But the Patriots?????!!!!!
Bahahahahahaha!! Choke on it!!!
What was that dude thinking?  Top 100 dumbest in NFL history.
Mejor regalo de navidad, imposible...
As a Dolphins fan… I feel your pain New England. 😆 😂
Leon Lett is suddenly looking like a genius by comparison 😱
The ankle twisters weakness is unparalleled..........not a tackle attempt but child being stepped over........pathetic.
😂😂😂😂😂
11:13 loves it. 😂🤳🤳🤚
And....let's end it with the dumbest play in the history of organized sports 😂
Well as a Texans fan I dnt feel as bad mills still lost us the game but not in this fashion ..like wow...the pats shoulda went in to O.T.  🤐🤐🙊🙊🤦🤦
Absolute dumbest thing I've ever seen in a football game
Somebody needs to teach Mac how to tackle besides the trip technique.
Only Superman can give a better stiff arm.
How to lose your job in 2 seconds:
У Джакоби Мэйерса теперь отличный пасовый рейтинг!  👍🏈
The look on jones face. Who ever made that call should be fired. Take your chances in overtime wtf!!!
Average Bill strikes again
Pats and Colts fans are in agony rn
Leon Lett thinks # 16 is an idiot.
lol patriots should have taken the OT instead of playing hot potato with the ball and blew it
😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
It was all stevenson’s fault like why lateral in a tie game just get tackled and go to ot I would be surprised if belicheck doesn’t bench him next week for that
This gotta be fake bruh 💀
complete b.s. ...... the toe was out of bounds and that's now two games taken away from the Pats by the refs:  Minnesota and this one.... they should be 9-5
Talk about your wacky endings of a game? LMAO
Stephenson actually fumbled the ball - it was lucky the other guy caught it but then he got stupid. Incredible. All he had to do was fall down.
That ending though, Talk about a game of hot potatoes LOL
Wtf are you doing pats?
Please upload a video of a large group of Patriots fans crying their little eyes out 😂🙏
Oh dear Tom Brady looked were you have left us….
I guess everyone wants to ignore the rigged call the refs made on the tying touchdown… that ending never happens if that horrible call isn’t made. Easily not a touchdown.
The Patriots have been a part of some of the greatest rigged games of all time
When doing to much, comeback and bite.
Belichick will be chewing out the players who did that stupid play!!!
I lost my voice today, thanks for the free win Pats.
OK You don’t do that if the game is tied only if it’s the last play and You are losing WOW that was top 3 not smart plays
🤯
Bill bout to put u deep in dog house if he dont cut you😞
That last play was the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen.
Reminiscent of “The Play,” Stanford vs. Cal, November 1982. The only thing missing is the band.
Stevenson needs to be drug tested immediately
Karma from 2001
Now that was an immaculate reception!
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved
Patriots had practiced that play,  but they just didn't execute it as drawn up.   Failure of coaching.
I'd never thought I'd say this, but thank you Raiders for clutching this game.  -a Chargers fan.
And I thought that nobody couldndo worse than the Colts yesterday😂😂😂 Just sit on it and go to OT!
LMFAO RIGGED
i dont watch football but this game came up on my recommended list, what did i just witness
Lmao funniest win this week haha smh
I’m excited to what flight react to that
Pats suck
WTF🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Never in my life would I ever think I would be happy to see the Raiders win. Just this once.
How is Bill making out without Tom?
It’s not just about the dumb decision, or even that it ended the game, but that it might in effect have killed their playoff chances
Time to fire Bellichick
Bill Belichik Has Assembled A Roster Of Losers! Since Loser Bill Belichik Decided To Let Winner Tom Brady Sign Somewhere Else ( Tampa Bay ) Brady/Bucs Won A Super Bowl.. And The New England Patriots Have Been A .500 Team/Zero Playoff Wins!
Up until now, the most embarrassing, stupid play to lose a game on the last play was that Saints DB who whiffed on the tackle on the last play of the Vikings playoff game several years ago.  Until this.  This was dumb to the twentieth power.
U getting traded bruhh 🤣🤣🤣
Go Raiders 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🖤🖤🖤🖤
Patriots said    "Tuck it!!!"
I've rewatched the last play a few times and I can't stop laughing.
Leave to the Patriots to lose like that.
60 yrs and I have never seen one like that
Hey NFL, nice job rigging that touchdown that was clearly incomplete. That's two games this season where the Pats lose due to horrible officiating.
Hate my team loss but it was good to see Chandler Jones get his get back against the team that traded him
Wow… could have just knelt and sent it to overtime… WTF were they doing
That’s what bum ass Jones get
The video doesn't show the replay or review for Keelan Cole's touchdown because they know it was clearly out of bounds.
Happy Kenny and Vilma got to call this one.
Crazy how you guys didn’t put up a replay of the out of bounds raiders TD to tie the game.
What the?! I keep on saying this is one of the best seasons i've ever watched!
Hey!! Carr been throwing in interceptions every single f****** game!!!
I’m confused what was Stephenson doing . That’s the stupidest play calling
How to get cut, traded or benched 101🤣
So are there just no pylon cams for that last Raiders TD that looked to be incomplete in many people's eyes?  Also great job Pats for getting cute rather than just playing for OT 👍
Don't know why the Pats didn't just take a knee and send it to OT. I'll take it though, I was at the game going for the Raiders!!! Everyone went NUTS!!!
im exteremley disapointed pats that last play costs a win we desperatley needed. If we lose to the raiders there is no chance we beat the bengals or the doplhins our season is cooked thanks alot pats 👌
This will go down as one of the greatest weekends in NFL regular season history.
Raiders suck. Pats just sucked worse today.🤭
what a choke
The football gods punished the Patriots for being greedy pigs.
Bengals  play pats  Saturday
first time i’ve seen the Raiders beat the patriots in my years of watching Raiders football and it couldn’t be sweeter.
Well, looks like someones gettin traded.😆
The most bullshit ending of all time!!!! Go to O.T and fight it out for the dub! Homie looked right at him and gave him the go ahead T.D!! That’s embarrassing and that team should be exempt from the NFL lmao
Right so we’re not gonna show the review for the tying touchdown
Raiders find the stupidest way to lose and the stupidest ways to win
Can’t wait for flight to react to this😭
Greatest/worst play in nfl history
And remember  They decided that Commanders giants should be the night game instead of this
TUCK YOU!!! NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS!!! RN4L!!! ☠️🏴‍☠️☠️
News Flash: Coach Bill Billechek has just $hit his pants on National Television..
What in the ever loving hell was that? Lmao
Is that technically a penalty on Crosby for hitting #16 so late after giving up the ball in that last play?
Hehehe..., looks like a comedy show!
Well,  I thought it was only the Colts' who sucked this week by blowing a 30-point lead on Saturday, but I see I was wrong.
Time was run out. This looks more fixed/ game thrown every single week! What a joke!!!!!
Webber calling time out is now off the hook.
11:11 sounds scripted asf ahahaha let's go raiders though
That is usually how my Raiders lose. But not today RN4L
This is why the team is called the Raiders
serious question: can this qualify in TNT's Shaqtin' a fool??😀
uh-oh!
Ai não meu jogador
In the 102 years of the NFL with no time on the clock no team has ever done such a dumb thing. Laughing stock of the NFL.
This week will go down in sports history with the most epic NFL games this week. Greatest comeback ever 33 pts. And the world cup.being so nail biting,  best final ever I'd have to say and the rest of these NFL games have been unreal!  Craziest week in sports I can remember in years
That finish was hilarious! Loved it ...
Whoever picks the thumbnails for these videos needs to be fired
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
Did anyone else notice the FLAG alert appear at 11:28? I was like, damn the Raiders screwed up again......
Would love to hear what Belichick has to say in the locker room and on the practice field this week.
Seriously who was he throwing the ball too.  Were they that desperate to not play overtime or did he thought he was gonna lose that game if they didn't score in regulation? Then the icing on the cake was that stiff arm from Jones to Jones.
As a native of Las Vegas it's good to see the raiders do something right for a change. Go raiders.
Belichick outsmarted himself on that one.
1st raider game I ever been to, wild ending!
Just Win Baby - Al Davis #Raiders
Almost scripted better than the Indy game .....
Holy Macaroni
It wouldnt be a Patriot Raider game if there wasnt something controversial to talk about 😂😂 tuck rule haha
Sin City Miracle
Wow.....from the Vikings comeback win to this Raiders win.
*Dub.* 👌💯
Keelan Cole was out of bounds, gifted win to the Raiders by paid off refs
Raiders always keeps fans 😊 or 😭.
Never in the history of the game has less thought been given to a situation.   That play is a desperation heave when you're LOSING the game.  Not tied.   Brutal.  Just absolutely brutal.
Still can’t shake Russell Wilson v Pats SB XLIX throwing the ball instead of gaining the W with Lynch. But it does make me smile!
Hope Bellicheck has a coronary.
Players should of been aware it's not a do or die play.dont risk something STUPID
Mac Jones tackle drill. What a dork. Do not ever tell me that dork is an athlete again. Runt over stepped on. Touchdown
11:11 who was he trying to throw it to? M jones? Why lol
Chargers fans stoked on this outcome
Always a pleasure to watch the patriots shoot themselves in the foot rather than the opposing team.
Fat Patricia should give up playcalling duties
That's why you don't try and play rugby in a football game.
LOL!!!
It always amazes me how bad football teams find dumb ways to lose.
Bill is nothing without Tom Brady period
Hi Josh "Your QB Sucks and You will be back Kissing Belichick ring " You Suck as HC. But what Needs to Happen on the Pats Matt and Joe (2 HCs that Destroy the Lions and the Giants) Fire them Sad Ass their Useless!!!
I'm sorry but someone has to get cut for that
I’ll wipe my tears with one of the 6 banners. Deciding which one to choose. Let me take these 6 rings off too while I’m at it. Don’t want to cut myself.
The Faiders allow yet another team to sneak back into the game, only to finally win on an outlandish and lucky play. It's retarded.🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Meyers doesn’t have a place on any roster making laughably idiotic plays like that.
RAIDAZZZZZZZZZ! On Folks Grave!!!
He dum
ANOTHER WIN  , THAT THE " RAIDERS     SHOULD HAVE LOST !!!     ,,,
Mac ( the backup ) Jones f’s up another game , once again his apologists will try to get Mediocre Mac off  the hook by blaming the play calling but to anyone with a clue the final series of the the game tell it all . Need to finish the game ? Mediocre Matt can’t move the chains , need to get a try for winning field goal ? Can’t work the sidelines even with 2 timeouts 😂😂, than has the chance to go to overtime and can’t even tackle a guy that’s busy catching a back wards lateral , looks like your 6 year old brother trying to stop you in a back yard football game . Mediocre Mac has been given enough starts to work  the next ten years in his career as backup across the league , Ryan Fitzpatrick 1.5 . Move the f on before the whole coaching staff is let go because of this topped out never will be . Oh yeah , should also mention that Defence  scored over half pats points while Mediocre Matt couldn’t even get the team into the Red Zone . The book is in on this guy across the league , take away his short throws and he can’t do anything. Move On ! Or at least give Bailey Zappe a look to see what you have and what will be needed next draft
Patriots: Overtime? We don't need no stinkin' overtime.
Patriots: Overtime? We don't need no stinkin' overtime.
Congrats Raiders 👍
Yo wtf were they doing at the end there... Dude should be benched for most idiotic play of the year lol
Belichick is a bum, he can’t lead men. Brady was everything for the Patriots. Back to obscurity goes New England
R U kidding me?
I can't get over that last play, belechek going out like bud kilmer from varsity blues.
I’m still confused wth
that lebron quote hitting different for the Patriots
As a Patriots fan I don't ever wanna hear another thing about the tuck rule. We're even.
Wow. Watching the patriots for the past 25 years or so I don’t think I’ve ever seen a dumber loss.  I mean, the loss to Miami where Gronk couldn’t make a tackle was bad enough, but this, this is….ugh.
That was clearly out wtf
Low end commentators
No way he had 2 feet in at 10:28 No dog in the fight but that surely wasn't inbounds.
Broooooooo😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭bellicheck mad aaf mane
Inventing ways to lose...
#RaiderNation ❤
Worse loss of the weekend (Or Millenium)?  1. Colts 2. Jets 3. Falcons 4. Cowboys 5. Patriots
Then he pushed dude down then he scores the winning touchdown😂😂
WTH 😂😂😂😂
They shoulda just went to OT lol
Matt practia might ,no is the worst offensive coridnator in the nfl not even a fight
Can't wait to see UTree's reaction to this one.
JMD: I did not call it, DC call it.  Patricia: I am not the DC, I am the OC. Patriots fan: damn, it is 2022
I was at the game today. Derek carr barely threw the ball to Adams. Lowk by the end of this season if the raiders don't boost adams contract he might request a trade to a different team
Talk about throwing the game away. Sheesh!
Homer would be proud. D' Oh'
Not tonight motherfuckers  RN4L
I was watching the game at a birthday dinner and I popped off in a room of 15 people.
That flag at the end . Had to look for literally any reason to take it away lol.
As a Miami fan, I know how this feels doing this to the Paycheaters! Whoooooooooo!!!!!!!
Wow that was the craziest ending in NFL this season... congrats 🎉
Bad juju passed on to the Patriots?? I really hope so!
I've never seen a game end like that. Patriots should have just taken it to overtime lol
Jones has been a nonfactor all year.
oc gonna get fired at the end of the season on this play alone lmao
Gronk must be happy, he no longer has the most embarrassing last-minute play in Patriots history.
What in the hell just happened🤪
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 PATRIOTS ARE SORRY AF -BILLSMAFIA 😎😎😎
Pats met aliens and showboat ending
what the f was that😂
That's karma for Pete Carrol's dumb play in the Super Bowl which benefited the Pats.
@ 11:00
WTF Beat down From Rookies, B.S. AM MAD!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
They didn’t even show a replay in the highlights of coles TD grab. I wonder why tho
Awesome day when the cheatriots lose 🤣🤣
Whoever that player was that wears number 16, he should not be on the team anymore. That was the most humiliating loss I have ever seen, what was he thinking?
Why is Hunter Renfrow  ignored…
This takes away from the embarrassment that is my cowbums
LOL ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ This is absolutely hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mac just sat down instead of tackling lol
Patriots. From NFL elite to NFL inept. WTF was that?
Everybody craps on Belichick for being conservative… well now you know why, to avoid a stupid move lmao … simple kneel and OT
Well now we already know what's going to Urinatingtree's LOLCOW of the week.
That Raiders win is as ridiculous as some of their losses this year. At least they've been entertaining.
After the snow game loss to the Pats, the Raiders deserve this one and more.
OMG !  STOP THE PRESS , RAIDERS  WIN , AND WHAT A WIN IT WAS, INCREDIBLE  ENDING !   WHAT A GAME !  Raiders dominated  the entire first half,  took Patriots  until 4th quarter  to get anything  going.  Patriots looked flat once again the entire first half while the Raiders looked awesome. When Patriots went up 24-17 they thought  they  had a win  in the bag and Raiders said " NOT In Our  House ". Raiders come back with 1:50 left on the clock, 4th quarter,  Carr throws perfect throw  to Hollins, then Waller, without those throws and catches the game is over, then the Hero  steps in, Chandler Jones !  Chandler Jones has the awareness  to catch the ball, then the stiff arm, then to the endzone !  Everyone  in Vegas by Chandler  Jones  a drink !  Huge play, biggest play  all season  !   Everyone  in shock of what just happened !  That was just so awesome,  how exciting  was that. Carr played  awesome too, made some mistakes,  but made up for those  mistakes  with handling the pressure  perfectly  under a minute and half.  Raider Nation stand up and applause  what your team did  ! Raiders are still in playoff  picture.  In the blink of an eye, they went from 2-7 to 6-7, how awesome  is that.  Josh  McDaniels , you officially have Raider  blood in you  now !  We all know this Win was  the sweetest  ! Who doesn't like to beat the team they came from !  The student beats the teacher !  The pupil  beats  the master  !  Josh  McDaniels  is no longer the student, he is now the master !  Everyone stepped up, offense,  defense,  special  teams, kicker, coaches, you name it, this was a team Win.  Watch out Everyone,  Raiders  are back in the  Win  column and  what  Win it was !
They really didn’t show the touchdown they handed the raiders that was blatantly out of bounds. Figures
The betting community must have been on the Raiders this week....
Raiders 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Que the Benny hill theme for that last play.  Raider Nation
His foot was clearly out if bounds.
Johnathan Vilma ,"UH OH, UT OH, OOH NO, OH WOW!"  On the last play ! LMAO!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wow.
One question tho. WHY?
The ending play reminds me of the razzle dazzle (we called them "razz-a-matooee") kind of plays we use to run at the park when we neighborhood kids played.  I remember lots of interceptions and touchdowns just like this.  Of course it was all fun - - even when losing like this.  I hope the Patriots players (and Bill Belichick) felt the same nostalgia and fun down deep, but probably not?
Oh... My Head hurts 😂
Belichick... " On to Cincinnati"
New England Patriots vs Las Vegas Raiders
Finally, some crap like this happens to the other team instead of the Raiders. This season has taken 10 years off of my life. LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO RAIDERS !
Can't believe this happened with a Bill Belichick team. Would not surprise me if he considered retiring after this latest debacle.
RAIDEEEEERRSSS 🏴‍☠️❤️
i like how they almost always highlight the wonning team on the thumbnail, but not on this one.
Sit down Mac😆😆
Quite obvious why this was done. Script wanted them to lose. Coach walking off at the end like “Fk that. I ain’t wasting more of my time to lose in OT, let’s just go home now”.
😏  *NO WAY THE NFL IS A REAL PLACE*
Seeing the Cheatriots lose like this just made my day!
😆 🤣 😂 😆
Outstanding!
just another obviously scripted game.
Fire Matt Patricia
Thank you patriots 😂🤣😭
WOW, for the Raiders that's a 20-year old payback debt for that truck game in New England in the playoffs that started the Patriots dynasty 20 years ago.
5:11 this is what I don’t get about Carr smh. How do you not see the safety coming down to cover Adams?!?! The slot WR was open on the hot route!!
waiting for flightreacts LMAO
Yes!!!!! Legendary ending!! 🎉
That Patriots' play was stupidly funny!!!!!!!🤣🤣😂
I’m sure people will still argue that Belichick is a genius and a goat. #NOT 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣 The team is only as good as the coach/leader. Tom Brady is New England. They’re average at best without him. #FACTS
Lmao  whoopsie
Sooo I guess the tech doesn't exist for us to see if the toe was in or out, just in the NY office huh??  Also what happened to the flag?
Man if Waller & Hen Dawg could have been healthy all season I really like this offense would have been insanely loaded with Jacobs & Adams
As a raiders fan, we all know cole was out of bounds. But I bet yall pats fans know how we felt for 20+ years about that fumble now huh?
Like WTF Jakobi 😡 , how can u make a hand full of CLUTCH plays & then turn around & make tha DUMBEST play of tha YR!¡!¡ I'm ova these fools dawg , ii jus cnt no more... Soooooo pissed rn
NFL will regret flexing this game from prime time.
What in the stupidity were the patriots doin🤣🤣🤥😵‍💫
Lmao 🤣
It finally hit me that the Patriots will take another generation to contend again.
WWE scripted. Made a phone call. So Rigged. As soon as I put money on the Patriots to win Yall made sure they did a fluke play so that the Raiders can win the Game. And u know it
Omg im a life long  fan of a Patriots joke starring Matt Patricia, a failed Defensive Coordinator who became a failed h/c along w Mr Judge both of whom coaching Josh Mc offense.....lol i can only laugh at the joke we have became.
Why would you call a draw play, midfield on 4th down with the game on the line?
Benched.
That was with out a doubt the biggest mistake in football history!!!
Wow the patriots are dumb lmao
Mac Jones went down as if he didn't weigh anything at all.
Patriots really did the most raiders move I’ve ever seen , but wow Las Vegas , what a come from behind win tonight
This felt like a road game for the Raiders. With all the Patriot fans smelling up the joint!
Pats losing like this just cured my depression i love to see it
Rigged rigged rigged rigged  Pats already win this game 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Jakobi Meyers is gonna need Jacoby and Meyers after Belichick is done wih his ass
That’s not the Patriot way. I think Bill needs to retire.
game should have been over after they should have called that td pass out of bounds. nfl is rigged idc what anyone says.
I thought..." there's only 1 minutes left in these highlights, and it's tied.....what about overtime?"
Colts: "We're gonna have the most embarrassing loss of the weekend".  Patriots: "Hold my beer".
Matt Patricia strikes again no slants very few screens and a hair brained play to screw the pooch and lose the game.
Just go into overtime.......... rigged !
New England is dead not the team that everyone used to know.  Every soon they are going to be like Houston this year.
RN4LIFEEEEE!!!!!
The Patriots are now officially “stupid.” I never thought I would be saying that, under Belichick, but they are. They are now officially “stupid.”
Tv broadcasters trying to give us a flag on the last play lol
Do something bout the refs call fine them that’s bs
Belichick is going to tear into the *ss in the locker room.
Flights reaction gonna be crazy😂
Refs won
Raider Fan In The House:"Yes Finally After Being Cheated Years Ago Keep Up The Great Work And Tbh This Was Scary But Anyway Go RAIDERS!!!!"
Mac Noodle Arm Jones failed his team once again. Not only did he have a terrible game overall, he also missed the tackle to prevent the touchdown. This guy is terrible. Also, Derrick Carr is awful. The Raiders are too talented to look so bad. And Carr missed some easy big plays. Very overrated qbs on both teams
What in the f*** was that ending😂🤣😂🤣
Scariest post game locker room I'm imagining 😱🤣😱🤣
I’ve never had any more respect for the Raiders that I did in this game.
Had the score pinned on my phone. Was puzzled how the score was tied at 32 sec left and lost by Pats before OT started.
Nice to see both Belicheck and Brady suffering. This is what they wanted and they got it.
If meyers went down instead of making that awful throw “back to Mac”, Folk comes out, gets them a field goal, boom. Victory. BUT NO. NOW LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.   -a pats fan
I like how whoever made the thumbnail made it look like the patriots won…..you ain’t foolin us lmao
People get fired over plays & decisions like that!!!!  Embarrassing
You can't watch that play only once
Huh??!!!
That is elite ball placement
Why can’t the raiders ever hold a lead and just win comfortably
That play will go down in history.
Wow
As a Chargers fan, thank you Raiders!
Raiders...REALLY LOSE...COLE WAS CLEARLY OUT, IF YOU ARE HONEST!!
What the heck is going on in New England?
Cannot wait to see flightreacts reaction to this game lmao
Whistle . . . "Flag on the play, Dumbfuck, Offense, 50 yard Penaty. Game over."
MY FIRST GAME EVER. MOST AMAZING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. RAIDDDERRRSSSS
How long did it take to script the end of that game. That was another Rigged Job. There have been a lot of them all weekend long.
Shaqtin' A Football Fool! 😆🏴‍☠️😆🏴‍☠️😆🏴‍☠️
I didn’t know the outcome and was watching thinking Patriots got this… now my mind is completely blank. What the F did I just witness
DA 17 horrible fantastly day.
Payback for the Tuck Rule game never felt so sweet. Every time though.
As a dolphins fan thank you raiders but wtf was that last play supposed  to be? I watched it 5 times and can't figure out what the plan was.
That was one of the worst games I have ever seen
The most sickening retarded play the patriots ever made in their history unbelievable stupid stupid stupid.
i fell like the pats throw this game by big mistake wow raiders got an easy win.
That guys benched
Keelan cole was out
1. Never seen an ending like that.  2. The WTF look days it all.  3. NFL in December brings them out.
That was so Dallas Cowboyish!
Some people will still argue it isn’t rigged. No way they’re that dumb.
Bill Belichick out Bill Belichiked Bill Belichik.  Literally only someone who is told how amazing every decision they have made for last 2 decades would purposefully call the dumbest play call in recent history (maybe ever?).
NFL is Rigged and Scripted . It's getting as bad as WWE . Freemason Orchestrated Deception . They pay the Sellout Circus Monkeys millions to Deceive the Fans . Fans are too Stupid to see .
What are you doing man?
As a colts fan, the raiders making me smile again helps.
Idk how this stupidity can get any worse regardless of how many seasons go by.. lmfao!!
makes you really question Belichick as a coach. The quality of the Patriots dropped multiple tiers after Brady left.
I had to sit through one fulll gawdddamphuquingminute of commercials to see how my Patriots lost.
If everyone feel stupid, just remember Jakobi did this. *huge groans*              How many times Belichick gonna lose to his apprentice?
What did I just see. lol
Wow, that is usually how the Raiders lose on the last play of the game. Take a knee and go for OT
The way Mac was put down! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fixed bs
Wow… Just when you think you’ve seen every possible way for a football team to win (or lose) a ball game…..
I lost braincells watching this 11:08
Hate the raiders when they went to Vegas
Old man, it's over,  leave while you still have dignity, you too Brutus the Pirate, and Jones...Jones.....Jones.....and #25 def, they caught what four passes over your head in the last minute, including the tying TD what a laughingstock we have become.
How as a patriot fan do we not win?…. Sad
"Situational football"
JUST WIN, BABY
Whoever idea that was needs to be fired/cut....go to OVERTIME!!!
Bonehead play, coach is gonna tear into him later
As a colts fan I thank the Patriots for continuing to make boneheaded plays so we can forget about that one time in Indy...
Coming up on the 50th anniversary of "the Immaculate Reception", the Raiders have now been compensated by the Football Gods with their own "Immaculate Reception"!
Can you imagine how pissed off bill is after that last play lol id give anything to seen his face live during that play...
Get it together new England that defense has to get better and that last drive was pittiful plug those holes up for the run and corners and safetys shut down the pass
BUWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!  I didn't see this game, so this is the first time I'm seeing this!  What a hilarious finish!
Crap is all fixed, just more proof.
Well, my dear Mr. #16 ... life is full of intelligence tests, and ya sure didn't pass that one!
W O W!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That SUCKS.  But that's the reason the New England Patriots, we are football. We've given the league,  the fans and the world the greatest football of the last 20+ years. We win and lose in spectacular fashion.
The official replay announcement on the Cole "TD",  by the ref should've been as follows:  "After review, the receivers arm was going forward, therefore, the play stands as called."
As a Jets fan thank you Raiders!
Good job go Patriots
The NFL is not even trying to hide the fact that they are scripted entertainment. And before I get the “conspiracy theorist” badge branded on my back, the earth is NOT flat and Covid was real. I’m also a fan of neither team so don’t even come at me with any of that bs!
STOMP!!! Have a nice flight, Pats!! 😘😘😘
Frigging morons
Just remember people it’s all scripted
Can't do it like miami
Bye bye patriots millionaire players who suck and don't care. NEXT WEEK STAY HOME.
This incredibly stupid move by the Patriots tops every single dumb thing the Raiders did all season, combined. As a lifetime member of Raider Nation, I feel much better about life today. 😀
Now I’ve seen it all. Now nothing will ever surprise me again. Very rarely do you see a team get hosed by officiating and THEN double down on it by hosing themselves. The Pats now have been involved in two of the most fucken idiotic last second losses ever (this and vs Miami in the infamous “Gronk plays corner” game). Just when you think NFL players can’t be any more boneheaded and lose their composure any more, someone will pop up and ask you to hold their beer. Ugh.
It doesn’t make up for the tuck rule, but damn it we’ll take it.
lol
"The Immaculate pick six"
easily the worst patriots team ive seen
Y’all think it’s Jones fault that angular or whatever cant mcatch a 5 yrs pass. Embarrassing. Once a year bill looks like a college coach.
🤣🤣🤣 Man in all my life I could have never seen a loss like that coming.   🤡🤡🤡 show.  Out raider the raiders 😂
1. What just happened? 2. That catch was out of bounds
I cant wait for flight to see this game
OH MY GOD, Chandler Jones may have just scored a big walk-off touchdown to win the game 30-24 in Vegas!!! I have never anything like this in my entire life!!!!!!
But let’s ignore the fact that the outcome of the game would be different if the correct calls were made by referees.
JUST WIN BABY!!
If matt pratricia is brought back next year I'm burning the stadium down
Payback from 2002 🤣 lol
Somebody's gonna get cut.
OMG OMG!!!!
In my over 40 years watching the  NFL  I have NEVER seen an ending like THAT!🤣😂
Patriots Coach said  to other coach ok we're going into overtime and these are the plays were going to run if we win the tossssss hold on what's happening on the field??  Why are the pitching it. Ok maybe we have something here hold on Chandler Jones ok he can't catch. What he caught it ok no way he runs it back ok did he just drope the hammer of Thor stiff  💪🦾........ Bill said everyone is fired...
I can understand why à Patriots fan would be upset. What was he thinking about. As Steve Erckle would say “did I do that”
Joe Pisarcik says thank you.
Mac has a noodle arm
Which is worst, this or how the Colts lost yesterday?
The rigging gets more obvious every week they not even trying to hide it anymore
Somebody's gonna die on that busride home
Oh man, I can imagine Belichick grilling the guy with the ball at the end... 😧
This should be call " The TD pass that won the game ".  This should count as a TD pass for the Patriot player # 16.  LOL
Only a White Texans QB can be named Kyle Dugger...
Can’t wait to see flights reaction to this😭😭
People dogging Mac when his goon WR threw the pass which is the dumbest thing I've ever seen. Someone NO ONE questioning the guy that threw a 20 yard lateral directly to an opponent..... No it's Mac Jones fault for not tackling one of the most feared defenders in the league.....
WHY WHY WHY? ? ? Why would they do that?  ? They weren't losing. Just go to overtime
Karma Baby
Keeping Up With The Jones’
The Raiders have lost 7 of their 8 losses by 7 points or less.  Very strange season.  Tom Brady and the Buccaneers lead their Division w the same 6-8 record.  Weird!
Jones stiff arms Jones for the touchdoooowwwwwwnnnnnn #RAIDERS
LoL thanks for w I'll collect now instead of giving 😂😂😂
Bruh, as a Pats I can’t wait to see Flights reaction cuz it’s gonna be funny af
#25 may have just played his last game. They were all over him on that final drive
It's been a rollercoaster ride for us all season. It's about time something went our way. I'm surprised the refs didn't blow some whistle to call that back. (Tuck rule)🤣🤣🤣
Cut Jakobi Meyers Now!!!
Patriots did a Raiders at the end there!
Glad it was Chandler Jones who benefited from a Patriots mistake.   Also, glad he stepped on, the Patriots fans darling little boy, Mac Jones, for the score. The weak link of the Patriots offense.
Carr sucks!!
This will forever be known as the stupidest play in NFL history.
Can we finally fire Matt?
Hilarious that his video doesn’t show the missed no-catch call on Cole’s TD
I ripped up my 4 tickets for next week. STAY HOME NEXT WEEK BUT YOU WONT. MILLIONAIRE PLAYERS WHO SUCK.
That's what's Raiders Nation!🙌👏🏈💀🔥
Now that REALLY IS a crazy ending!!!
Go Chargers!!!
I can’t fathom Myers logic on that play. Even if Mac Jones caught it… what was he going to do? 😂😂😂
Was at this game live, my first NFL game and damn it was crazy in the stands
1st; as a Raiders fan since conception, I have to be honest. . .Cole was out. THAT being said; based on that goofy *UnNecessary Roughness* schoolyard play, I'll take the bad call and the win. 😄😆😂🤣That was dumber than the Russell Wilson's Superbowl XLIX goal line pass!!
Yeah   fortunate    for    Raidernation
I don't like either team but this is hilarious.  I hope Jakobi Meyers signs with the Chiefs after he gets released tomorrow.
Bailey Zappe
The Dumbest Play In NFL History
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA what a woosie tackle by #10 HAHAHAHAHAHA
This should make up for that tuck rule bullshit call years ago....u love seeing miserable fails like this..love it
Pendejos!!!! But I like
This makes me forget the Texans horrible record
HOW CAN THEY LOSE TO THE RAIDERS?   WHAT DIRECTION ARE THE PATRIOTS HEADING IN FOR THE FUTURE?
As a raider fan I guess I'm partial but I think I may just have seen the stupidest play in NFL history LMAO
LOL that dude isn't going to have a job in the morning. i bet belichick lost his fkn mind when he threw that ish up to jones.
Patriots on suicide watch       As a Vikings fan, WHAT A GAME
Man, the players and play callers on the Patriots must’ve been high as f**k on that last play LMFAO
I have watched 90% of every pats game since 2001 and this by far the dumbest thing I have seen.
LOL
Busted play or not, I'll take it lol Raiders haven't beaten New England since I was 9 in 2002.
Script writers are going crazy this weekend
The Patriots Lost to the ONLY COACH WHO LOST TO JEFF SATURDAY! 20 years of sucking here we come.
That tackle attempt from jones…
Rigged, ain’t no way they wouldn’t just let it go into overtime. These are professional football players. They have more common sense than to do something like this. He basically handed the ball to him. You can’t tell me these coaches and players have this poor judgment
Talk about anxiety RAIDER NATION
WTF WHY LIKE WHY
The dumbest Football play I have ever seen in my 65 years!  Nuts!
This game ending, DUMB play just might surpass the Leon "Lett it Go" play of 93!!
HAHAHA @11:13 SIT TF DOWN MAC JONES
PATRIOTS JUST SUCK!
Y’all that was the dumbest play ever
RAIDERSSSSSs!!!!!!
RRRAAAIIIDDDEEERRRSSS!
Most teams would take a knee and take it in overtime, but not the Patriots. They want to lose right away.
now that's one for the ages. That's called literally handing the game away 😂
Dumb, dumb, dumb.
The ending wasn't crazy it was stupid.
Honestly I’m tired of these rigged ass games…
Mac jones is so trash please get rid of him next year and lose as much as possible this year so we can get a good draft pick for a qb
That was bad. The worst maybe. I feel bad for those guys. Didn't know they were tied?
We got lucky today…but I’ll take it
“Uh oh…uh oh!! OH NO…OH WOW!!”
That’s ridiculous
How bout them RAIDERRRS!!!!!!! F*** the Pats
Man, y'all must really miss Tom
Rigged
Mac Jones is TRASH y'all just keep on thinking it's gone get better IT WILL NEVER GET BETTER LONG AS HE AT QUARTERBACK.......
Looks like someone career is over... Don't think he or they will live that down. The first thing to come to mind is I'm glad that wasn't ME....
***Bill, I know u got 6 rings as a head coach....I get it!  But at the end of the game in a situation like that take a knee & then take your chances in OT...end of story!***
This game should be called, ( The Immaculate Conclusion)....
The Las Vegas Raiders are 6-8⚫️⚪️🏴‍☠️☠️💀 Week 16 at Steelers
Reminds me of the Dolphins game a few years ago except Miami did it right.  NE was left holding the short end of the stick in that one.  Nice to see they haven't lost their touch and even out did themselves in this one.
Wtf you wouldn't want to go in O.T smh.. 3 second to decide to do a dumb play to lose the game
Thank you for throwing the game Patriots! You just put the Chargers in the playoffs 🤣
-First win over the only AFC team (save for the Raiders, obviously) Derek had never beaten.  -First win over Belichick and the Patriots since 2002. -Belichick and the Patriots have never won in the state of Nevada.  A pretty good day all-around for the Raiders 😁
This makes the Miami Miracle look like OTA's!🤣🤣
Patriots will never be a threat until the get a elite qb. Mac can develop tho.
Derek carr is a scared scared quarterback
Patriots are nothing without tom brady 😂😂😂😂
So does that count as a fumble recovery or interception?
Bill's  bag  of  tricks
Between this and the Miami miracle the patriots have two of the worst losses in modern NFL era
That’s about the dumbest football play I’ve ever seen. Wow
This nfl Season has been crazyyyy asf wtf was that by the patriots
as a pats fan.  now we are even for the tuck rule
The patriots have been eliminated from the playoffs
This was the stupidest way to loss a game ever wtf man should’ve just went down and played for better chances in OT -_- could’ve been 8-6. I’m in disbelief. Just wow
You cannot tell me that wasn't scripted. As a Raiders fan, I feel bad we won from that absolute farce.
Casinos made that call !!
And the tieing Raider touchdown was out of bounds on replay.Can you say fixed, children?
Man refs cheated the pats out of this game
Most embarrassing lost ever....this goes down ..thanks patriots
Raider Nation
This year weird as hell let’s see the yoffs
Gotta Love this!!! Mac got MackTrucked 😂
🚨BREAKING NEWS 🚨 The 6-8 Raiders are celebrating beating the “ we don’t care” Patriots 😂 Patriots having fun, Raiders sweating 27th place ..pfff 😂😂
That'll be on ESPN's NOT Top 10, who agrees?
The word dumb should permanently be replaced with Brisett.
From: The Patriots To: The Raiders  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!
11:12 is the greatest moment in Raider history
The bubble screen.....obviously they kbeqvit was coming.   Another..McDaniel fault. .
INACREDITÁVEL O NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS
What was the flag at the end for?
Deff can tell Mac jones has never made a tackle in his life 😭🤣
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Patriot fan here who is still throwing up. Situational idiocy. YOU GO TO OVERTIME!!!!!
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Jakobi Myers with the dumbest play you'll ever see. Just a bonehead decision in every single way.
Still no pass for the "tuck rule"
The game tied and you have possession, instead of just going into ot. You just throw it away to your opponent smdh
The flag at the end of the game with the refs not finding anything was the best part 😂👏👏👏👏👏
Stop Jones on Jones crime!
He redemmed himself 😂 after missing that tackle
Clutch win
Watch as the Raiders org uses this as proof that McDaniels is HC material.
Just won baby!...😎
Out of bounds on that td catch for raiders at the end but I must be blind like the refs
If any team’s fans deserved a thrilling at-home, walk-off play like that, it’s the Nation. ☠️ 🏈
Raiders Archive Material 🥲
Belichick to Johns:” Leave the ball, take the Connolly 😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a Charger fan I never thought I’d say this, but go Raiders!
Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes. lol
Cole was out of bounds on the touchdown, but the officials are idiots. That final play might be the worst play I have ever seen in a football game!
Not playing the game, I would like to think that it's every defensive players dream to stiff-arm a player on offense. But to get the QB is just *chefs kiss*.
The Dolphins did it to them, the Raiders did it to them! Now, who’s next?
Lol why not just lay down and send it to overtime what a stupid decision
What in the hell was that?!!? I was anticipating overtime and that guy decided to be Santa Claus and give the Gift 🎁 of Giving to The Raiders!!! I guess he felt guilty about that "Tuck Rule" call back in the snow 🌨️ years ago in New England which kept The Raiders from advancing to The Super Bowl??? Thank you for your generosity, New England! You really are true "Patriots!"
I felt like Derek Henry was In is blood alittle
Raiders fan here. That was out of bounds. But hey thanks for the TD. 🤣🤣
"we're on to Cincinnati"
Play of the year!
Meyers.....and Jones.......SMDH
I was listening to sports talk radio about that last play.  They said Jones whiffed on the tackle and while the entire team went after Stevens, Jones was just chillin' and ended up  being at the right place at the right time.
I have a feeling #16 will be in the Coach's office tomorrow & sitting in the back of the plane alone on the way home. YIKES! 🤦🏽‍♀
Can't wait till flights reaction to this game
What a pass from carr to tie the game once again he showed how clutch he is…..  and for jones to get the pick and win it!!!!!!! LETS GO RAIDERS!!!!!!! SILVER AND BLACK BABY!!!!!!
This looks like the clip from the waterboy where Adam Sandler those the ball to the other team.
If people don’t know football is rigged that’s why it’s called Vegas scripts they spent all that money on there offense of course they want to see them go to the playoffs
OMG OMG OMG check and see if he had money on LV
Last play was absolutely insane!! Idk why he just didn't fall down with the ball and take it into overtime..lol omg
Mcdaniels is undefeated against Bill as an nfl head coach. Stat that! 🤑
Add this one to the long history between these two teams!
The Las Vegas mirical
Hey patriots fans don’t worry. As a colts fan I can confidently say this isn’t the most embarrassing loss of the week
That stiff arm to Mac Jones. 🤣
I've got nothing for this
BAHAHAHAHA
This is up there with Jim Marshall running the wrong way.
That one play could cost the pats a playoff spot
That stiff arm on Mac Jones at the end
This ish is sooo f'ing fake how can you not see it!!!
All you had to do was not lateral it to the other team ..I'd cut the MF immediately.
just wait until flight see this 😂😂😂😂
As a long time patriots fan my words are as follows:   JUST GET DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!
im so confused. Why didnt he just go out of bounds or down? OT is no good? I really dont understand the thinking.
Bunch of Clowns, I’m praying to god they loose every game for the rest of the season, no reason at this point to get even worse draft pick, than again Belichick will pick some dumb ass that could’ve been picked in sixth round anyways
This game was better than watching the Titans game. Nice job Raiders, that ending was crazy. ❤❤.
Once again my Raiders win a game in the craziest ways possible. Good game to the Pats and their fans. Go Raiders baby we are still alive.
What BULL that the touchdown was not over turned!
Lol here for the comments 😆
To think that the Pats came back brilliantly. Defensive TD, Great runs and A runned TD and passes, a passing two point conversion too. Thanks to a rugged Raiders team they manage to tie it up just before the end of the game with a great play. Pats desperate drive at the end to go for field goal. Get stuck a little too far with not enough time on the clock. One snap left. Might like to down the ball and go to OT. Maybe just try a deep ball? A few options to try. Given this…   …..why lateral the ball?
That ending has to be one of the dumbest plays in NFL history...Belichick the "genius" ROFLMAO!
Jones shoving Jones head to the ground was magical
Meyer's lateral pass (for NO REASON AT ALL!) was as bad as Di Maria grabbing a guy to give France a chance of a comeback in the WC
Mac Jones couldn’t tackle him? He looked like he wussed out and fell down. They don’t deserve a playoff spot cause they suck.
You were going to OT, there was no reason to do that??!?
The refs robbed us then we robbed ourselves
Belichick should retire.........he's nothing w/o Brady
Blame it on Patricia
The refs screwed the pats with that last raider offensive TD. TOTALLY OUT OF BOUNDS
NFL y’all need betta script writers the acting been bad the last 3 yrs 😂😂😂nobody falling for it but the sheep
10:20 I'm sorry, but that was the most soulless call I've ever heard. Totally devoid of heart or emotion. Was the booth getting coffee or something?
Well I am guessing the Patriots know their not in contention for the Superbowl so why not lose more games and up your draft pick. That's about the only thing that makes sense of the end. Bill could easily be responsible for this. Will see next week won't we...😆
Mac Jones can't even tackle to save his life. Jakobi went from a hero to an absolute zero. That head bump Mac gave him after the 2pt completion must have affected his brain a bit 😫😫😫
I didn't even get to see that ending live and yet I'm still in shock trying to process it.
He pushed mac jones to the ground 🤣
That is the stupidest thing I have ever seen any football player do in an NFL game. And I have been watching football for many decades. I take great satisfaction at seeing such pain be inflicted on the Patriots, who have not suffered at all for a long time.
lol
Funniest ending ever
I don't. . . what?. . .  why did?. . Ya know - if they didn't have the biggest comeback in history today, this ending would have been the headline.
Bill Belichick is making the whole team walk home
Wow billy cutting that WR
Immaculate recepchan
NFL is rigged. Chargers win and then the Patriots do this play when all they needed to do is run out the clock and you’re telling me a college QB Myers throws it directly to Chandler Jones?  Fishy
Thank you Raiders. From a Jets fan.
Bill about to fire somebody.
Not a touchdown he was out of bounds I’m gonna cry
Hey..... listen..... as a Chargers fan, I'm going to say this as kindly as possible..... thank you for the W..... punk ass Raiders 😂⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
W   O   W  !
There's something great about watching Chandler Jones stiff arm Mac to the ground like a rag doll, then watching Belichick stroll onto the field with his typical smug look after a loss.
Have you ever heard of a self liking ice cream? This is the patriots
Breaking news , billicheck explodes in the locker room
Rigged!!
Just take the knee and go to OT. WTF? 😂
Imma commit sepuku
How the hell was that a TD catch before the last play bro and I'm not even a pats fan
It could of been another game lost, I don’t like how my team makes me feel.
As a Bills fan n a devout Patriots hater than was great ! Only way it coulda been better would have been with Brady still there... welcome to football he'll Pats fans
Couldn't happen to a nicer team and 😋
Aside from the refs failing to know what a straight line is & how an object can obscure that straight line ( a foot ), the ending was hard to watch. Raiders deserved to lose but patriots deserved to lose more.
Patriots: Pats: Live by the miracle return TD, die by the miracle return TD (ironically it was scored by a Jones just as the Pats got theirs)
What were the patriots thinking?  Omg!!
Just Win Baby! Typical Raider Fashion!
Jaw dropping performance
They thought they were in the longest yard 😂
Why didn’t Meyers just go out of bounce when Stevenson pitched him the ball… would of been a 52 yard field goal or so….
The Raiders: suck  The Patriots: *suck harder*
God Bless Coach man he don't deserve this
mac jones is garbage lmao
Thanks for saving my multi patriots 🙏
I wonder what Bellichick said in the locker room after the game 💀
Wow
Happy Birthday to me! 🥳🏴‍☠️
Y’all gotta change the thumbnail to chandler
I’ve been a patriots fan since 1995. I think I’m done now 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Raiders get a lucky break  I can't believe it I'm still in shock
WTF 😡 😡 😡 😡 😡 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Lmfao I don’t care who the Pats play…it’s always a pleasure to see them lose.  This was funny as hell. Like watching the 3 Stooges 😂😂
This is payback for all those years that the Patriots, uh, game the system to win those Super Bowls 🤣🤣🤣
Jakobi Meyers pulled a Bobby Boucher & threw it to the other team
360p 🤣wtf
Come on, let us share this vid!
This is like when you’re getting greedy with the lateral button in madden and it back fires. Truly lolcow of the week contender
Should have just went down and played for OT.
How the mighty have fallen.  The Patriots go from a super discipliend team to not even realizing the game is tied and that there's no need for a lateral play.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
If the Patriots don't make it to the playoffs this year. It will all Meyers fault.
I'm a patriots fan and that has to be the dumbest 🤬 I have ever seen in a nfl game, hell sports history!!! They had the game won but the secondary decided to take a nap, not the mention the bull crap toe out of bounds TD that the refs were too stupid to realize, but the game was tied and could have just went into overtime and you do THAT to lose?!! After that, this team not only doesn't deserve to smell the playoffs, they should be the joke of the entire nfl FOREVER!!!!
What a stiff arm 🤣
bill Bellicek please retire now... tom brady goat.
Meyers probably thinking “wait a minute isn’t Chandler Jones our teammate too” 😅
If there's a better team in the league at finding ways to embarrass themselves, I'd live to see em lol What else is new.
That was the dumbest call bill has ever done just Hail Mary to either win the game or overtime that simple sportscenter not top ten coming Friday
Play of the year
Hopefully, Raider fans shut up about The Tuck Rule now.
Why is he throwing the ball backwards?! It could of been overtime!
This is by far the worst game ever, Never do that again Matt patricia
That’s was the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen someone do in the game of football
Wtf was that New England 😂😂
I’ve been watching this game for years, and I have never seen anything so dumb like what I witnessed watching this ending.
Brady made belicheck
2 dogshit teams going at it 🤦🏿‍♂️
As a patriots fan I now know how embarrassing the Seahawks fans felt.
The Bucs are trash and Pats. wow.
360p in 2022? come on
not a catch
I read that the pats lost to a pitchback fumble, and i thought they must be really stupid to risk it in a way that gives away a td.  well, it was far beyond my expectations.
What were they thinking??!?
Jakoby Meyers get ready to be cut for the dumbest play in NFL history 😂
We’ve gotten historic and crazy comebacks, games coming down to the wire and so far two walk-off PICK6s to top top it off. GOD I LOVE FOOTBALL!
I'm a raiders fan and I still don't know how that just happened. The running back goes down and there in field goal range why toss it back then the wr freaked like don't give it to me and tosses it back. I still don't understand how that happened I'm confused.
Raiders! Raiders! Raiders!
Jacoby Meyers is this Generations Leon Lett.
All AFC West teams won today! What a feeling!
Craziest ending I've seen in a while
What an ending, go raiders!!!
The Patriots stole the Raiders game plan of blowing the game!  #BlownLeadGate 😂😊
Thank you, Raiders! - Chargers fan
Good thing they flexed us out of sunday night football too watch this good game and heart attack again by the Raiders and a crazy ending nice too be on the side were we win the game they dont come like this this often but ill take it...
What a wild ending!!Thank you Raider Nation from a Charger fan!! 😂😂
Mac Jones is a bust.
Meyers forgot Chandler Jones wasn’t a Patriot anymore on that last play
The Patriots won that game and they still lost.
Notice how they left out the replays of that Raiders “TD pass” that was clearly out🤣
You know belichick is screaming at them especially Meyers who threw the game away lol.
Play of the year f_king 100% beautiful and it has a possibility for the browns in the playoffs  Tho no possibly not
Meyers should get benched for the rest of the year stunad black 🖤 man fuhgettaboudit..
This is the most dumbest thing I ever seen
Can we all agree , his foot was out of bounds …
🏴‍☠️😂
I shut the game off because I was like "here we go again, the Raiders are going to blow it".  And then saw the final score and wasn't sure if I was reading it right.
The Chandler Handler (stiff arm) Game
WOW! Posted 5 min ago and already has 7.8k views
11:11 The Immaculate Pass 🥲
As a Raider fan I feel that Belichick felt bad about McDaniels from last week and gave him this one.
My brother is a pats fan..I saw his face that whole play😂
Derek Carr sucks seriously he stays in the packet to long he needs to move or run it damn 😡😡
Good.  Love it whenever Patriot fans have to suffer.
Been watching football since 1978 and I don't think I've seen a came end that way....was that a reverse hook and ladder?  I have no idea who the hell Meyers was throwing too, but #11 just getting pancaked by Chandler is the real culprit...other than the 'mastermind' Bill Belifraud.
0:16 offsides on the right tackle? Raiders fan here. Just sayin. 🤷‍♂️
As a Chargers fan, I would like to whole-heartedly thank the Raiders for pulling off this miracle win.
Why not just down it and go to overtime ??
The way he ran thru Mac lol😂
I missed it because the imbeciles at CBS decided to keep most of the country with the 3 score blowout Tampa/Cindy game with a couple of minutes left only.
*Fun fact:* This was the first Raiders win against the Patriots since the 2002 regular season.
When your fantasy team needs to win 🤣
Jones on Jones crime!!!
I KNOW YOU MAD FLIGHT💀💀💀💀
Jacobi Meyers must’ve had money on the raiders
Why in the mortal living...I can't say it,just, my bp is too high.
The oh wowww at the end was too much😂😂 11:15
Let's goooo Raiders
Jacobi Meyers, please report to the principals office. Bring your key card IMMEDIATELY
Uh…what….I mean … WTF ????
I didn't catch the end live so can someone explain how the Raider's receiver's foot came down on the line, but it was still a TD?
WWE style finish! Awesome! Good game.
Raiders bringing that Vikings heart-attack energy to their games, I like it
That stiff arm to Mac Jones was icing on the cake.
I cant wait to see Flight react to this , lol
#firemacjones
That stiff arm. He killed the quarterback.
what.....the hell.....was that.......
I guess the patriots didn’t want to play in OT
What does Belichick even say to them after that???
who the f*** does a lateral in a game
Ppl are okay with refs messing games up until it happens to them. The league needs to get sued
What a crazy ending! That may have dashed the Patriots’ playoff hopes!
Flight is not gonna be happy 😂😂😂
Safe to say the Raiders finally got their TRUE revenge on the Patriots for the Tuck Rule 🤣🤣🤣
The ref make me hate football
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That ref needs to donate his eyes to science.
Our team is good, it's just Derek Carr that sucks. He got carried again
For once the Raiders didn't BUCKLE AND CHOKE In the final minute of the game!! Tough scene for Patriots fans LOL LOL.....
Belichick will NEVER play the man responsible for that ever again.
First, the Davante adams walk off touchdown, then the josh jacobs crazy run, now chandler jones! I love the raiders
Literally looks like it's rigged.... This ending is that stupid
That last play ranks right there with the colts fake punt play lol. More fitting, it is new england lol
Kenny Albert  NE and LV on FOX
Just a ridiculously dumb play.
I can't wait for Flightreacts to see this
If Patricia is not fired after this game I'll lose trust in this org...that's a soul crushing loss. Who do the Pats draft for QB next year after Mac goes to jail for killing Matty P?
Anyone who bet on The Patriots for sure believes the NFL is staged after this.😂
The Patriots just pulled the most Raiders move I've ever seen.
Wasn’t that last touchdown by the raiders out of bounds ??? What is up with these refs ?????
This was a game of who wanted to lose more
What a finish
New York clearly needed Raiders ML cuz Cole was clearly out
i hate life
im still tryna rap my mind around how we lost this
From a Pats fan, the better team won today
That game tying TD was definitely questionable no doubt, I feel like the refs had to redeem themselves after all the blown holding calls vs the rams. Hats off to both teams for making this a good game! #RAIDERNATION
Game was so rigged the nfl is a joke😂😂😂
This is up there with Q Williams stiff arm 😤 to Hill for td
Well someone on the patriots is gonna get fired 😂
As a pats fan we deserved that loss, that last play completely removed any room for complaining about the TD call (won’t even mention the god awful first half) 😂
We not making playoffs 😢
Patriots 24-17 against Packers in 4th quarter, loss. Patriots 24-17 against Raiders in 4th quarter, loss. To expect the defense of the "greatest defensive mind" to hold in 4th quarter when needed is like to expect Brady to fail to put offense in FG range to win with 90 seconds left. BTW, watch carefully how Belichick and McDaniel hugged each other.
What a vegas rigged way to end the game
This is gonna be on the highlight reel for a while. Sorry to see this happen to you Pats fans, you didn't deserve this. I am glad that it happened though, because as a Colts fan, it makes you feel a lot better about the Vikings game.
Hollis s was out of bounds, that decided the game, pats vs refs
Why is it always 360p?
Kenaan coles Td was def outta bounds but Gg raiders that last play was horrible
Someone is gonna get a good talking to after the game 😜
CHANDLER JONES TRUCKING MAC JONES TO WIN THE GAME THAT WAS CRAZY. Raiders played terrible in the second half but offense was clutch on that last drive and defense got that TD. Let’s see what happens on the road against Pittsburgh!
Last play is 11:00
This has been one of the craziest weekends of football ever!
Can somebody explain why Meyers threw the ball away in that situation?
New England !!!! WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!!! How’d you lose to the raiders of Las Vegas !!!!
Stiff arm of the year 🤣
Is this college football only need one foot down 😂😂😂
Already know Flights reaction gonna be crazy
One of the most embarrassing losses in NFL history.
This week is crazy
Wow🎉😂😂😂😂😂😂
If this wasn't an early Christmas gift for Las Vegas than I don't know what is.
Bruh why did Meyers do that 😂😂😂😂
That play that was under review was definitely out it’s so easy to see unless he doesn’t have toes  we all know a shape of a foot
This was worser than my cowboys OMFGGGG 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
the Pats clearly had no confidence in their defence if they pulled a stunt like that instead of taking their chances in overtime. YEA RAIDERS!!!!!
🗣RAAAAIDERS 🔥
It seems more and more these days, the winner of first half manages to lose in spectacular fashion. Especially if they are the underdog…. They magically score 33 points and win. I think the nfl knows it’s losing viewers because of it’s woke bs and they’re trying to make the games more exciting
I'm too early
I’m in depression
This has to be one of the wildest finishes in NFL history. RRRRAAAAAIIIIIDERS!!!!
I know some new-borns who could come up with a better play than that last Patriots play.
Bro pats went bad to good and good to bad
Flight finna cry 😭😭😭😭
The way that this game was the most craziest I have ever seen. Jacobi Meyers is going to hear it from Belichick when he looks at film the next day. That’s stupid on his part to make that pass
insane ending 👏👏 but not as good as the world cup final today
Still don't understand how Hollis TD was upheld. Everyone saw he was out
I’m the 69th like❤
Nah bruh this has to be rigged. First of all there is no way notoriously conservative Bill Belicheck would let his team do goofy lateral stuff when in a fine situation for OT. Then the execution of it…. Worst backwards pass attempt I’ve ever seen (literally threw it right to chandler jones with nobody near him) and absolutely 0 effort on the tackle to take chandler jones down. All this following an absolute Mickey Mouse TD call to let the raiders tie  it.  I’m not a fan of either team and this was max entertaining but as a neutral observer this looks odd to the point of suspicion
I’m a patriots fan
bruh they shoulda just went to overtime. classic patriots move 😂
I cannot wait for Flights reaction to this game he's gonna flip out.
Raiders get revenge for the tuck Rule game 20+ years later LOL 😂
Unbelievable. This is a top 10 goof of all time for sure.
The Pats just gave this one away.
NFL is rigged
No way LOOL
THIS GAME WAS WILD! Raider nation till I die lets make the playoffs
As a Cowboys fan I’m glad we don’t have the dumbest loss of the day lol
is the nfl going to make a statement about the out of bounds touchdown? we are owed an explanation
Great game
Thank you Patriots. Anytime I do anything dumb ever again, I’ll just remember the last play and realize that I could be doing worse.
6-TIME SUPER BOWL CHAMPION NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS HEARTBROKEN TO MY CASINO LAS VEGAS RAIDERS 10:59
Belichick wanted to keep his losing streak alive when  facing his disciples
Now this was game of week
Wow what a game
Pray for flights door when he reacts to this
Ouch.
The ending to this game was crazy!
Insane ending.
Sup
SIN CITY MIRACLE!
Bill Belichick is overrated. He is nothing without Brady. Time for both to retire.
Belichick coached team nowadays is like a black coaching staff 💔💔💔
maimi miracle but in vegas
I used to laugh when people said NFL games are fixed. Now, I truly believed it is from that miss call TD. Either way GG Raiders fans
Belicheck when being asked about Meyers postgame: Onto Cincinnati
Hollins Td was out of bounds
Bill gonna grab a rifle and take that man out back like old yeller for that lateral attempt.
Wow
Solid plays by the pats. Couldn't of asked for more
First. Raider nation boyyyy. Winning in style.
Furst
That was fast.
