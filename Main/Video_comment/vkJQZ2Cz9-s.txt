Jin Kazama is the most Badass character ever created. It's almost unbelievable that such a Badass character even exist

Jin Kazama
I miss the old heat engager and it's sound
The way he says "Jinnn kaaazama" got me
ilove jin chetu
I hate this trailer, with all the devil gene stuff, overdone particle effects and the anime rage art, but normal gameplay looks kinda nice! Hope Jin stays the karate master, T4 Jin best Jin!
I love jin kazama❤
Jin Kazama is a kick-ass machine!

What's the song over this trailer?
jin is my fav and best character the moves are awesome.
When Jin said “Strength isn't Everything” he means you shouldn't rely on your power but rely on your own STRENGTH.
Don't say Heihachi Mishima isn't here in this game! 😨
Go Jin Kazama! My favorite character!
Days before my mom passed, she thought that was me when she saw Jin on screen, and I found that remark kinda funny 😂  I miss you, Mom
Jin Kazama That's My Guy
Very noob game  and jin is noob layer
Jin is Sephiroth's clone confirmed...
That hotdog cart is more durable than the street apparently
Kazuya: Power is everything! Jin: Power isn’t everything!
It’s believing time  -Jin kazama
The man who once held the world in his hands as the head of the Mishima zaibatsu   But later fell from grace!   The man who lost control of the zaibatsu   JIN KAZAMA!!
Damn he muscular❤
I really wish that you give Heihachi as a DLC character!
MEZAMERO, KAZAMA JIN!

I’m getting Tekken 8 For My Birthday!
What they should add or been added to tekken 8   Battle clash range to see who get the last clash range blow   Much more strong never be used before old & new characters   A new game mode besides the beach ball like quest mode or fortress idk something interesting besides beach ball mode   Different stages awaking for Jin and he's dad Jin base form from base 2 to base 3 devil mode   Heat rage mode for others when they lose health they also have a awaking mode buff mode most likely that mode will show that there damage will buff moves   They should've added a much more epic battles for characters   Much more good and deadly music ost that never been heard before/ much more deadly stages / much more rage moves   A sad heartbreaking long 10 hours gameplay with so much sad deadly bad death endings or so   Feel the vibration deadly vibration from the control from the damage and all moves u performed should be felt from maximum vibration in your control   A side quest for each characters like tekken 7 but each character has a hour quest to be completed   If not already than the game should be 100 times instead better more things to do than tekken 7 itself   Copy what mortal kombat arrmgodon did bring in race cart for tekken 8   Emotional cut sense   Bring mostly other new things deadly mode fun mode open world much more rage mode something new that never been heard or used or playable before something new   Right now the game thats about to release for tekken mostly look like a 50$ most money highest game everything I say they should add will make it a 100$ game  anyway that's my tekken 8 review from good & bad whst they should've added

“Sorry to keep you waiting” Great Jin NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS YOU STARTED!
Tekken 6 hearing the evil  Tekken 8 you finally hear change  i live long enough to hear him this
In Tekken 8.....  ....the Son will redeem the Father.
TSURIIIIA !!!!
Where is Lucky Chloe?
Looks like our boy has his heroic self back^^ Jun would be so proud of him
Let's Get It!!!
Jin Unstoppable
Tekken is king.
My 1st favourite character is Jin Kazama.
I wonder if you can dress him up like sephiroth
“Strength isn’t everything 🧘‍♂️ “ proceeds to beat the BREAKS off kazuya
Kazuya took some of his edginess n now he acts like a true anime protagonist 🙏 this is beautiful
What Jin would say but not say "I don't hit women"
I'm really really excited, these trailers are the best, and the phrase "fist meets fate" is the resume of all for this history.  Tekken will be a monster for the fighting games
Are we not going to talk about how amazing the fighting announcer is?!
From "Chikara koso subete da" to "Chikara dake wa subete janai". Character development 👏🏻
0:38
Jin really pulled the Japanese “kept you waiting, huh”.  Damn it Jin, you Snake
Jin Kazama looks cool in tekken 8, his face, hair, voice, fighting style, jin is excellently made, can't wait to play him❤️❤️❤️❤️
when tekken 3 ps5?
かっこいい！
where tf is his spining kicks ?
Daed of arlive  7
Ryu vs Jin Kazame vs Van Damme ☝️ Would be interesting 🤔
this jin kazama oh my god wow 😳😁(jin) 👍👍
goosepump 😡😡🥵😰😰
🐐
i love how they give Rock Howard treatment to Jin
Tekken 8 seems so bad seriously wtf they did to my bro jin
😎😎😎😎🤩🤩🤩😍😍😍
0:38
It's cool to assume that lars has been training Jin. Cuz some of Jin's new moves are similar to Lars.
Everyone's talking about the hotdog seller, but nobody about the bakery Jin's opening at the one minute mark...
Have a feedback
The devil geene demon inside of him is his bitch
Put the characters  Leon S Kennedy Chris Redfield Ada Wong Albert Wesker and Jack Krauser
I love how Jin is the literal embodiment of 'character development' throughout the Tekken series.  Genuinely super hype to see this new Jin in action, he's so goddamn sick this time around
Man jin is super cool 😎
Bro said DOOYA 💀
I want my devil jin back
1:17 that kick looked SO disrespectful to me!
I really like how most if not all the Mishima Style moves he performs shows his devil wings, indicating that it's the evil half he's learned to control
Shinsuke: 風間さんでしょうね. Jin: えいー．風間仁. 仁って呼んでね. あなたはWWEのスーパースター、中邑真輔ですか？ Shinsuke: うん. WWEファストレーンの後は友達になりましょう. 仁、何て言う？ Jin: 承諾します.
Jin: Power is everything!  Jun: 🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴  Jin: Strength isn’t everything!  Jun: ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
Why did no one comment about Jin going “DORYA!” with the Mishima style uppercut as an opener for his rage art? My boy’s killing fire with fire here!
I love it Nostalgia
It's never a TEKKEN without JIN ❤️🔥
Bro just went from "power is everything" to "strength isn't everything"
Mm ripka s kazuroi i sho astalas 12 dnej i boi.
DID THIS MF TURN INTO SUKANA??????
Jin: あなたわ… イヨスカイか？ IYO SKY: お前わ… 風間仁か? Jin: うん. つまり、あなたはWWEのレスラーです。お会いできて光栄です.
😂
28th March 2022
We want devil jin back
Man I hate how they felt the need to make every character mindlessly flashy to just generate mass appeal.
I appreciate he's wearing Jun's color scheme. Also that electric came out fast af 😳
In This game i see film Takkan jin is batter than all of fighters i am ri8 but in film jin is learn every opponent fighter moves and King of game
You know I hope both kazuya and jin have their own unique like *ULTIMATE* devil form like kazuya did in tekken 7, you know not his normal devil form with akuma or gameplay, his final fight devil when he's fighting heihachi and special matches, I hope both have that in their final showdown to make it more epic
Oof that rage art is so lacklustre damn.
I still want Devil Jin in Tekken 8 with some more new moves and such 😭
history shows japan is most colonial resistant sushi
this game will possibly release in 2024!!
Jin kazama es goku 👊
Jin out here channeling his inner Rock Howard
Jin ❤
Where is Jin's karate Dogi costume from tekken 4??? Jin need it back a full contact karate DoGi !!!
Jin is Tekken's GigaChad
seeing some character development there
every gymrat wants to look like Baki, Goku, or Batman, but I want to have Jin’s physique
So if he can do devil jin moves, then what about devil jin?
PLEASE INCLUDE WEI WULONG IN THE ORIGINAL CHARACTER ROSTER OF TEKKEN 8.   He’s a fan favorite and my favorite player.
He is handsome ❤
I've had a crush on Jin since I was around 5, and now I'm 22. I used to cry when I lose because he is hurt😢😂😂
BRO THE BACKROUND IS FROM SF6 free roam its canon that ryu and jin have probably met
0:55
Will tekken 8 have wave dashing for jin?
The Pharoa From Tekken Jamaica. Arcade Play He Kazuya.
Heat system is not good
😊 ❤uno de mis personaje favorito de  tekken
1:22 jin dorya'd the one who dorya's others 😂😂😂
Looks like Law, Guile etc may have a Civil Lawsuit on that move Jin incorporated into his move set.
When you combine Noctis and Jin and Devil Jin this is what you get.
strength isn't everything you need a power
Dude is the new one winged angel
I hope there will be another jin without power
I notice that Jin is now acrobatic than before.
so they merged devil jin and jin with the combos
so bad
I'm in love with that jacket
I think his mob west reflects on training with Lars
The thing I’m concerned about is the nurfs .. jins parry is so important and the auto block system means that when the parry timing fails because the online lag happens, you aren’t punished for the lag 😂  I think the attraction to Jin is his parry for me and making it harder to use isn’t going to make people want to play him.
Tekken went from intense real life fighting to anime and skullgirl style game from tekken 6 to tekken 7
This is such an awesome trailer
1:04
My man got some new drip
Main pb
M j
You Shold do a "Cross Console" only !   and a PC pvp  sepertly, to ensure pure competitive experience
1:19 Release the bogus!!!💪🏾
Jin needs a better rage art
Too fake I prefer tekken 6
Best tekken character hands down
Teringat masa kecil dulu, suka main videogame tekken8👍
Call me stupid, but I just realised that Jin's current outfit matches the colors of the new Bandai Namco logo
He is my best friend favourite character. I also really like him and his story
reminds me a lot of rock howard 😅
My main. <3
Love Jin and his move set. Wish the devil wing didn’t come out so frequently though
‏‪0:28‬‏ ⚡💎
His final battle with Kazuya is going to be a repeat of Kazuya's with Heihachi
jin tekken 3 is the best
I don’t really like combine of devil jin and human jin. But we'll have to see how it plays out.
GIVE JIN HIS ORIGINAL VOICE BACK!!!!!! WE NEED HIS "GEH" SOUND EFFECT AFTER THE ELECTRIC HOOK FIST!!!!!!!!!
Can we play tekken 8 on android
1:22 *DORYA*
Take a year if you want for Nintendo Switch but I want it 🙏 I would pay 50 to 80 dollars for it 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
So where is Devil Jin?
Jin is not more a demon now him is Sephiroth
Does anyone know to tell me when Tekken 8 will be released for sale?🤩
Man went from not being able to control his devil form to merging with it from the help of Jun
Oh boy, I enjoyed this one way too much. ^^ Now I want to see Bryan even more.
Too much unwanted lightning effects.
Dont like the Announcer, hope there's an option for T7 or pre Announcer.
So there will be no devil jin in tekken 8,thats just sad,DJ is one of the best tekken 7 character while i could never learn to play with jin,So kazuya has to be my main now i guess
Where is the ‘TU’ and ‘DAH’ and ‘YEH’. They just changed his sounds. This is why Tekken 6 will always be my favourite Tekken game. Tekken 4 storyline was so great. Tekken 5 was great too. Tekken 6 was really good, after that… dead. all that’s changed is the graphics.
Jin always wears the most badass looking outfits
I get that Jin wants redemption in T8,but what about the dozens of people his war killed in T6? Imo the best ending in T8 is Jin sacrificing himself while killing Kazuya.
My Main!!!!
❤❤❤❤❤🤩🤩🤩😈 so good
After seeing Hwoarang’s Rage Art, they could’ve did WAY better with Jin’s. Just one punch? Really?
The new voice of the announcer bullshit.
When will the announcement of Lydia?
Jin kazma is my favorite character of this game but as the game progresses, Jin's moves and actions are getting dull like the finish move.
Jin T8 is so Fancy his T7 chrachter is better in my opninion more realistic !
Like a boss
Street fighter x tekken PS5 launch karie kiya rahe
Frank Shamrock in Tekken 8 !!!! He will be facing Ken Shamrock in the final boss fight !!!!!
so much for karate,  he fights like a  naruto character now
Bandai namco, eu uma pessoa do brasil e sou muito fã de Tekken, mais do tekken 5, tem alguma possibilidade de vc lançar algum tekken? Pois eu tinha um Playstation 2 e acabou quebrando e eu amo o jogo tekken 5. Tem como colocar na play store ou manda um link pra usar no pppsssppp
Jin: Sorry to keep you waiting   Apology denied. WE HAD TO WAIT 6 YEARS!!!!!!!!
Please make music in Tekken 8 that makes you move. So that the energy is overflowing. There is nothing good music in Tekken 7. As an example, you can rely on Tekken 3 and TTT2. What's with Jin's rage? Is it possible to do at least as in the trailer? Thanks
That gotta be a rock Howard reference 1:32
JIN KAZAMA!
Devil JIN Kazama
Nothing can compare to TEKKEN 3 .... the most real and best game ....
Ah yeah Jin Kazama is awesome
1:21
bro has no enemies
BANDAI NAMCO PLEASE RELEASE ZAFINA I LOVE HER SO MUCH SHE'S SO GOOD PLEASE RELEASE HER !!!!!!
1:02 ZA WARUDO!!
Tekken 8 should have a CPU level 8 like Street Fighter 6, cause tekken have the wrost CPU ever...
Watching the official trailer for gym motivation
1:22 HE SAID THE THING
0:55 1:02 1:13 1:27
Anyone else getting a Rock Howard vibe here?
Cant wait to see full devil transformation, the movie model was pretty cool.
1:23 did i just heard Durya ????
Wtf bro, jin just stole lars movements😂
Isshin Chiba (Jin's VA) really nailed it during this trailer! Love his role as Jin so much! ❤
Jin fighting style is both his mothers and the Mishima style
If Asuka gets Lili, does Jin get Miguel? I need my main in 8 please 🙏🏽
Jin is Fallen angel
One wing only 😅😅😅
Sephiroth???
Levi or Eren Jaeger VA will be fit for Jin`s voice i think...
He will be the key to saving the world
Looks like Jin tore a page out of Marshall Law's handbook far as the moves is concerned
Wow
WE WANT BAKI HANMA
Love them wings just fluttering on and off screen, the animation is dang cool!
"I shall not waver again" 🔥
It's crazy how much information is packed in these trailers. I was wondering how people knew Leroy was coming, but at 0:35 you can see a few character references.
風間仁の空手のスタイルの美しさを提供してくれた鉄拳クリエイターに感謝します。
Wow... it really feels good that Jin turns back to Lightning of Fate again.
guess no devil jin this time around
Do yoshimitsu next please
It's just me, or Jin's rage art could be better?  I mean... Look at Kazuya, Lars and other characters' rage arts...
TEKKEN PLEASE ADD SHAHEEN
0:32   0:55   0:57   0:59    1:02
Hey Bandai Namco, can you make a next character, alisa pls please can you make all the next fighters,?
will jin end the war
Jin Kazama is my favorite character of all time
Like Apex you should have multiple rage arts to chose from that you can equip like clothes. That would be cool and make your character feel more individual
And I love leis floppy moves too
And I love jumping over ppls lows with lei and ending up behind them 😭 before countering them while they’re confused
I Hope they put lei in this one. He’s so much fun, I love running away from ppl then evading their moves with my back turned before countering, they get so mad bc they can’t hit me 😭  Throw vertical strikes or overheads
Not a gain
The graphics look amazing but the amount of lighting effects every time you land a blow seem a little excessive
Please we all want *(Baek Doo San)* 😢 💔 .   *(Hwoarang)* will be happy ❤☺️ .  Guys give me likes to raise this comment for *(Baek Doo San)* 💪😤 .
For general translation of Jin quote: Strength is my BICH!
why is this soundtrack so fucking fire
Please make a game for psp plz plz
I wish they bring back replay ko’s and tekken volley ball , and I miss Gon.
Pls put amd fsr on it
❤good and hard
No more “Daaa!” on electrics 😞
for a moment I imagined the jojos
One black wing. Bet he gains a white wing from his mother in this game too.
This is one of the characters of Tekken 8 that I’m most excited to play with.
So Jin has finally mastered his devil powers. This oughta be an interesting installment, indeed.
I love how jin puts WAY MORE émotion When he fights since he was so quiet in the previous games
I hope Jin and his dad make up so they can play catch at the park 😌
I think Devil Jin will be playable in Tekken 8 with some new moves and power up because Jin is just using 50% or 40% of Devil form moves here. I could be wrong but Devil Jin is very popular and if he will not be in the game might be a letdown for many people, same thing with Heihachi hope they bring him back just as DLC character like they did with Kazumi in Tekken 7
Now Tekken 8 only needs Heihachi, Jinpachi and Kazumi as DLCs and we will have all Mishimas and Kazamas in one single Tekken game 😁
1:10 poor guy's just tryna sell some hot dogs
Jin is my favorite character out of all tekken characters
They returned Jin back to the character he was in the Tekken 3-5 days! Awesome! Especially after Bloodlines reminded me why I became a huge fan of Jin Kazama to begin with. His heel turn in Tekken 6 always seemed off to me, so to have Tekken 8 return Jin to his original persona makes me feel like an old friend has returned. Welcome back, Jin.
Harada and the NAMCO team, please, for the love of God, remove this glitter from the characters' blows, my eyes burn a lot, even when I dim and calibrate my TV, I'm going to stop playing this game because of the exorbitant brightness in the game, this is too ugly and hides defects in the game. You don't need so much glitter on the particles for God's sake, for me I wouldn't even launch the game with rage art that's a bad joke for newbies who don't train to come back without training!.  Please listen to HARADA BANDAI NAMCO fans, don't do the same as CAPCOM who are losing their fans and (customers) more and more
1:07 the true final boss: unwavering hotdog man
I might not understand game mechanics or overall play good, but I beg you guys. Don't make Devil Jin just a transformation, or worse, a move
How many fighting games are there where they introduce a main protagonist from the third installment with as much love and care as Jin?
İt's personal op. But i think face modelling of T7 is  better than modelling of T8. İ'd expect much more than that considering waited years after that fantastic T7. Although, for sure the  game mechanics are  the best so far. More dynamic, more attractive and like they introduced more aggressive. Let's see what happens next
Man the new voice lines for Jin are so 🔥🥹. Sounds like Tekken 3 Jin
😩 ❤ still one of my childhood crushes
I like when Jin speaks Bulgarian - "Ша ва срина!"
Jin: Hmph, power is everyth... Xiaoyu: uh...Jin, Auntie Jun is behind you, she looks a bit angry. Jin: coughed...I mean, Strength isn't everything!
always my main character, love ya jin ❤
В конце так опасно сказал - Гурамару гурамара. Прям мурашки по коже.
How yall give the main character the worst super
I think it looks s###
Estimados amigos de tekken project primeramente agradecer a Dios que les haya dado este talento para implementar este gran juego que es Tekken gracias de antemano solo queria decirles que si es posible cambiar en el juego definitivo al que presenta a los luchadores antes de las peleas es decir al que dice "get ready for the next battle" desde Tekken 5 hasta el Tekken 7 es una marca registrada de este maravilloso juego y se escucha muy bien pero ahora en Tekken 8 la voz se oye horrorosa no suena nada bien por favor cambienlo por favor que no salga en el juego terminado es un ruego de un gran amante de esta maravillosa saga gracias hasta luego.
Dear friends of the tekken project, first of all, thank God for giving you this talent to implement this great game that is Tekken. Thanks in advance, I just wanted to tell you that it is possible to change in the final game to the one that presents the fighters before the fights, that is to say The one that says "get ready for the next battle" from Tekken 5 to Tekken 7 is a trademark of this wonderful game and it sounds great but now in Tekken 8 the voice sounds horrible it doesn't sound good at all please change it please that it does not appear in the finished game it is a request from a great lover of this wonderful saga thanks see you later.
Jim Kazama is one of my favourite fighters and seeing him going from “power is everything” to “strength isn’t everything” does show he has come to his senses.
1:25 Sephiroth: I approve
Let there be an option to turn the bloom off... it hurts. Not as much as Tekken 6's but yeah..
My guy went from "power is everything" to "strength isn't everything." Just shows his character development.
my husbando
Many Kazuya Mishima users in Tekken can perfect Jin's moves because Jin can execute both Kazama and Mishima styles. Jin is the perfect epitome of vengeance after of the death of his master, Heihachi
Dang jin feels more humble and calm minded now and feels like he has grown alot. Good to see him not follow his father's footsteps.
game looks crazy, but they made jin and kazuya's style too similar to boxing
The #1 thing I like the most about Jin in Tekken 8 is that he has his T3 voice back.   Oh nobody noticed?[Go back to Tekken 3 Jin gameplay]
Te amo Jinnnn, hazme un hijo
Ryu much? Lol. They’re really really copying Street Fighter now.
Hmmm... Jin looks like he's channeling Rock Howard
Dio?
Most likely to become Batman.
This guy has Guts energy with him
That ultimate really sucked
Hwoarang when?
I am happy that Jin also my favourite character in the game have gone through the transformation, being more humble and can now control the Devil gene, he still has good in him and that makes me happy to hear, All his move sets shown here looks good, my only criticism is his rage art, I have now seen other characters rage art and to me Jin's rage art feels and seems too basic and feels as if Jin is in a rush to end his opponent, whilst other characters tend to punish then goes for a finishing blow, keep this as a finisher just start his rage art only as a real true Karate practitioner would. This is what I feel is missing.
They returned Jin back to the character he was in the Tekken 3-5 days! Awesome! Especially after Bloodlines reminded me why I became a huge fan of Jin Kazama to begin with. His heel turn in Tekken 6 always seemed off to me, so to have Tekken 8 return Jin to his original persona makes me feel like an old friend has returned. Welcome back, Jin.
Even tho it’s non canon I hope they still put dj in the game my fav character
Makes me wonder if playable Devil Jin is gone now
I want Jin to breed me and produce our babies
Jin kazama is best guy ,
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaarmor kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing, Pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeeeeee!
OMG T8 GONNA BE THE BEST TEKKEN EVER LETTTTT'SSSSS GOOOOOO
Low IQ people seem to be very confused about Jins immaculate character development.   Ill explain in very few words.  Tekken 3 and previous years: Jin being a good natured boy, just like his mother. Bowling Pin Gauntlets become legendary. Devil Gene activates. Jin unlearns Mishima-Style Karate. Heihachi is a good man.  Tekken 4, 5: Jin becomes the hooded drip God. Jin struggling to control the evil. Jin defeating Kazuya, Heihachi, and Jinpachi. Jin taking control of the Mishima Zaibatsu.  Tekken 6: Jin decides to amass evil in the world, for the sake of Awakening Azaezel to defeat him in an attempt to end the Devil Gene. Many think Jin is evil. Jin is not, nor has he ever been evil. It takes a very strong will to take on the role of the villain for the secret sake of destroying something truly evil.  Tekken 7: ded RIP my boi 🙏🏾   Tekken 8: My boi in control of his demons??????????????????????
1:07 that poor girl in the "carrito" xD
Thank you namco to entertain my childhood..👍💟 my personal fev Jin 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro killed millions when he wavers...so I guess it's good he don't plan on wavering again
Jin's voice changed. I don't like it
BRING BACK TEAM BATTLE
Jin, as one of the main characters of the story, should have been stronger. Currently, he is defeated by both Nina and Lars, which is surprising.
Will this game include a setting for all voices to be the Same language and high hair strands
Devil jin will be in this game?
Yes
Jin really looks like his mom
man please tell me he's FINALLY GOT OMEN STANCE IN TEKKEN 8 NOW cause he's making our boy heihachi proud with that OTGF
That jacket looks absolutely badass
The indestructible food truck. 😅🤣
Who does the one wing better...Jin or Sephiroth?
Power is everything vs strength isnt everything
Power is everything vs strength isnt everything
is it just me or Jin Kazama movement look more flexible than before?
Jin tekken 7 Rage Art: Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora Ora!  Jin tekken 8 Rage Art: 💩
When you ned to have Devil Jin and Jin in TTT2 to fully grasp his playstyle, and now you only have Jin himself symbolizing the control he has over himself now. That’s amazing.
1:27 did i jus hear a Chidori????
Jun x Jin reunion gonna make people 😭
Great fireworks display, really excited to finally see the guys fighting in the next trailers.
Jin: "Strength isn't everything" *proceeded to beat the crap out of Kazuya
quietly waiting for Hwoarang
Tekken is really the only fighting game that's all about the characters, isn't it? Like don't get me wrong. . . I LOVE slutty fighting game girls. . . .But Tekken's lore and characters are just pure hype.  Street Fighter PRETENDS to be about the characters but COME OOOOON~ Ya'll know what we REALLY came for and what we ended up staying for.
The slick jacket, energy wing that pops out during specials, and using the evil powers he inherited from his father for good give me some real Rock Howard vibes - I love it
As someone who has been completely disinterested in Jin ever since his departure from the Mishima/Kazama blend of Tekken 3 and 4, I am super hyped to try him out in Tekken 8!
Why Jin kazama has short hair in tekken 8...
his karate is so gorgeous
I've missed on Tekken 7, but Kazuya and Jin look really fun! Can't wait for the Heihachi trailer!  (It's a joke, guys)
This guy is stunningly Japanese.
Cadê o capoeirista meee jogo parece teken7
Sorry. I want to see something more from Jin.
Bring Josie Rival back!!
Are we just going to ignore Sephiroth being ripped off here
Always loved how far he’s come and now he’s destined to end the war he started and finally learned how to control the devil gene. Damn he’s come a long way
Glad to hear "strength isn't everything" from Jin. Great gameplay.
OH MY GOD!!!!  That poor food vendor guy.  Damn Mishimas messing with people’s livelihood again. Lol.
Roger Jr?
Looks like trash
This is reality.
Kazama ryu has some new skills!
he did become more flashy
Wish they got rid of rage art
Believe me or not, jin is bandai's favourite character clearly😅
Devil jin
I love how they knock there opponent into the hot dog vendor as a reference to how expensive and shitty most hot dog vendors are in new york. Get bashed on 🌭
Okay Jin, now that your out of your Coma, try to not doing anything stupid this time. We don't want a repeat of the whole War thing.
Instead of doing a tekken vs street fighter game they should just add dlc to this game for tag mode and some street fighter characters, would sell like crazy
bros rage art needed more love ngl lars and kazuya got anime protag treatment and jin got 2 punches with particle effect
Did Kazama just super punched kazuya balls?
Xbox Series X is going to look the best of all the versions due to the fact that the Xbox Series X is so much more powerful than the PS5. Namco is doing a good job of taking advantage of the superior Xbox hardware.
see y'all later ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Jin kazama one winged devil
That jacket looks fukin awesome. I want it
Rock Howard Style Jin Kazama 🥹
fast food salesmen don't have light life in this world
When did sephiroth get into tekken?
where is tales of symphonia bug fix update? Are you going to sell tekken like this?
My favorite moves besides his rage art is savage sword (d/b+2, 2, 3) and his laser scraper ( b, f+2, 1, d/f+2). Man Namco sure did buff his laser scraper like seriously they made his move as a combo extender! I'm getting Tekken 4 vibes when watching his laser scraper combo.
Finally, next gen graphics
The dude in the van should have been doing something like cooking 🍳
1:11 Yes! The savage sword move!
Mid
This game looks amazing
This is pretty cool. But. ARMORED CORE GAMEPLAY PLEASE.
Still hoping for jinpachi
That jacket is f'ing hard as HELLLLLLLL.
I can't stand the announcers voice. Hopefully we can change it like in mortal kombat
Bring back Bruce Irvin
Their he is there's my main guy jin🤩😎
Damn I'm gonna have to learn Jin this is so fucking cool
1:06 Andrew Tate?!
I hate the announcer voice......it STINKS!
Jins swag has been so wack these past few games. Dressing like a hollywood club promoter
They said that they were compiling jin and devil jin together, but i did not expect this, he looks OP AF.
the real MVP is the hot dog counter person for not flinching a single time while Jin beats up his own dad right in front of them
Sephiroth?
Did he just pulled a Ryu and dominated his devil?
Does anyone know the name of this song?
Yo that song at the end is fire
Oh Bruhhh it’s the sound effects for me dawg this shi go too hard
j'attend le trailer de bb Xiaoyu !! j'espère aussi qu'elle aura vieillit
Best trailer so far
cant wait for the Jun Kazama Trailer
They should have made his Ultimate more cooler like the other characters
New fighter and martial art pencak silat from INDONESIA
apart of upgraded graphics i see absolutley nothing worth full price game.
1:17 zen 1,3 is like the new 3+4 now if I’m wrong ?
Dumb story.  Jin hates his dad kazuya. Kazuya hates his dad heiachi. I get it right?
I liked JIn until 4 but im sure harada will make sure emo boy wins everything no suspense no variation etc...
Man I miss Tekken 6 😔
So is Devil Jin not in this game? It doesn't seem entirely necessary since it looks like Jin has "tamed" the devil half.
the last mortal kombat that made me happy was on ps1 and everything they did after that only worsened the streak.  I don't play mortal kombat anymore... it's hard to come up with a bike when you already have one.  I see your path the same way.  although I am a big fan of the series (. as I see it, soon we will not have to press the buttons, we will just watch videos with rages and super blows, bravo !!!
JIN: Save your princess! Its time! Im not getting any younger!
Did Jin say 'Doriya' just before his super?
roo much flashy lights and colours....
The Fact That the hot dog men not move is too good 😂
Is it just me or Jin actually have more kicks in his newer combos since T7? And some of these kicks are quick launch attacks probably similar to Hwoarang, Lee, and Law?
1:10 I love how chill the guy inside the food store is XD
It’s time for Jin’s son
I mean, don't they get old?
As long as he still has his iconic flame pants costumes, I'll be happy. This dude IS Tekken!!
They need to improve the rage art rest is good
"Make sure there is a huge billboard in the background showing the fight between the two fighters in real time" -Namco Bandai boss, probably
The devil gene used to own jin but now jin owns the devil gene
I hope those stupid mortal combat/street fighter effects with slowdowns can be turned off.
エフェクトばっかで何をどう食らってんのかわからんな
1:10 lmaoo the dude running the hot dog stand is completely unfazed
So no more Devil Jin character now
0:21 Lighting of Fate  Man talk about daddy issues 😂😂😂
Top bro sangat menarik banget aku yes, from Indonesia.
truly looks current gen
I wish they had jins "noises" from tekken 7. Them "twooo, duuii, chiestoo, yhi, hah, deh, 😂😂 elite noises
I am going to main this dude so hard!
i love his screaming 0:58
Eddy Gordo when? Eddy Gordo when? Eddy Gordo when? Eddy Gordo when?
my goodness Namco Bandai going hard, love this
I hope Devil Jin will be still playable as a separated entity from Jin, I don't wanna lose my main 😭
TEKKEN 8 – Bryan Fury Gameplay Trailer💪🦾🦵🦿✊
Kyoufu wo Oshiete Yarou.   - Jin Kazama
Quanta coisa brilhando e colorida
just remove this stupid voice from the game !!!!!
Tekken has never been as good as it was in Tekken 4.
Main selected
I wonder if Jin's new control of the devil gene means that Devil Jin won't be in T8. Would be a bummer, since he's my main, but Jin looks so good in this one I wouldn't mind switching.
... damn, I really can hear the Lenne Hardt from that announcer
That poor hotdog vendor.
PLEASE do not let this be the announcer in the final version of the game.
strength isnt everything, said by someone muscular hahaha
Team jin from the start
Forget the players...  1:08 That hotdog stand is the real protagonist!
Is this the Kinnikuman anouncer?
Love this announcer
Him wearing the T5 gloves again is so cool and nostalgic
1:34 1:21
Jin flashing his one wing at the end reminds me so much of Sephiroth's victory pose in Smash Bros
Wait he's got EWHF and EWGF? That's hype as hell
Buakaw would be perfect for Tekken 8. Here are some special movesets: 1.) left teep, left side teep, left flying knee 2.) left side teep, left high kick 3.) feint into a left hook to opponent’s liver 4.) left teep, left side teep, right teep, flying right teep 5.) get up close and push opponent away for a heavy strike, get up close and push opponent and feint 6.) grab incoming mid kicks and throw opponent down, or grab incoming mid kicks and sweep them onto floor 7.) left or right low teep - counter low kick spammers
😃
im gonna miss akuma but damn this is looks legendary
Announce Akuma
Did Jin just say Doriya during his rage art?
Don't play taken because against Islam هەموو ئەو کۆمێنتانە ئاگادار بکەوە ئەم یاریە مەکەن
Nooo don't let king surpass Jin's trailer in views
can't wait to master jin
For those who think they've heard the narrator's voice, she's the narrator of Yakuza 0 in the pit fights. I can clearly hear him screaming GORRRRRRRRRO, MAJIMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i love you Kuya Jin Kazama big fan Game fighter of the year 2023
Props to the hotdog vendor
lol kazuya eats soda
Poor hotdog vendor just wanna make a living.
Hope they Turn down the particals a smidge

He reminds me of Sasuke uchiha lol
I wish Roger jr, Alex, and Gon to be in this game.
The best main character of Tekken in history!
Here is the main character
Seeing Jin's movesets I'm getting some Lar's vibes or is it just me? Either way it looks pretty good!
Sick reveal!  Hoping he can kill his father though.  The world may depend on it.
los efectos de Jin Kazama son una bendición ve
I love ot but i also feel like im seeing less than what was done for kazuya. I am a little worried because i havent seen any stance and the way the game is played now doesnt seem focused on countering and defense which to me is jins main strength. I think they're gonna surprise me though. Game looks amazing!
GIVE US LEI WULONG AS A BASE CHARACTER NOT DLC
1:25 YES!!!!
No way, he subdued the power of that demon
My biggest question is does Jin's magic 4 crumble again like classic tekken games?
This new game gives off massive WWE vibes combined with a urban setting and I'm here for it. Jin looks like a brand new character
This is not Tekken!
Jin: Lightning of Fate  Anna: Trap of Thirst
The golden boy of Tekken
Is see that Leroy has started a coffee business.
It's really awesome, to see that Jin is embracing the devil and incorporating into his fighting style, and you can also see that he is also using other Mishima techniques into his arsenal.
"Strenght isn't everything" *Proceed to blast  nuclear bomb fist hit*
Tekken 4 Jin vibes he was so cool looking back then and he still is
Jin has always been my favorite! It’s been a while since I last played tekken, I will be getting this!
Jin is a whole ass grizzled demon man now and I'm here for it.
That poor food truck guy 😢
_strength isn't everything_  *proceed to beat the daylight out of his opponent*
Nothing changed game still trash
To play tekken 8 will be a dream from now on
So does this mean we no longer have separate jin vs devil jin anymore
This rework is amazing. He's my go to
Jin the goat
Why does it give me a feeling of KOF gameplay??
I wonder of that low roundhouse move that is iconic to Jin is still in his moveset here.
I wish he still had some of Juns moves in his kit like in tekken 3. But he looks awesome nonetheless.
Hot dog lady is nonplussed.
Street Fighter doesn't stand a chance.
Lei Wulong Please 🙏🏽
Hmm
That hot dog stand is the hardest substance in the world, if it's able to brush off Jin beating Kazuya against it.
Jin got humble by lars.
Please please do one of the girls next, or a run down of who is on the roster.
Waiting for yoshimitsu new appearance
Am I the only thinking his Tekken 7 fighting style is more artistic ?? This one is kinda Lars feat Devil Jin :S
That was a sick jin trailer, sad that i don't get to hear his violent "CHU!" and his "DAH!" voiceover anymore but who knows it might be still in the game haha
Everyone's talking about his Devil Jin moves, but I don't see anyone talking about how his regular, Vanilla Jin moves are now just Lars moves. He's been spending a lot of time with his brother, I see.
JIN LOOKS INCREDIBLE!!!!!!
I hope there's a way to also let him wear the hood like in Tekken 4 and 7 and 5.. and 6
This looks MWAHDDDD
ANGEL JIN INCOMING!!!
Let’s hope it’s 60fps 4K this time on Xbox.
So dissapointed that this game will be not available for ps4
En iyisi kazuya.
Is it just me, or are some of his moves similar to lars?
After Jin defeat the devil genes in the previous Tekken, he still has half of it?
1:10 Продавец хотдогов: 🗿
Should have added Sephiroth’s theme
Where is Hwoarang ????????
Finally 😃
I like everything but the announcer 🤣 He sounds way too energetic.
Why TTT2 still isnt that far and maybe gameplay better from what i see here..i dont know.. the first trailer was an experience...this ..i dont know.... not good graphics fro tekken 8 and ps5
I just want to now the name of the back ground music ??!!
Jin now you can take all the bitches on your side
nooooooooose.
Music and Voice are horrible. Tekken 5 was best of the best!
Kazuya's gamplay trailer is waaay better. his skill moves are insane
His  moves ressemble those from king of fighters' terry bogard or rock howard particularly.  Also It's cool teken uses more graphic effects.
Remind me somehow of rock Howard. Quite stylish. I'm hype for tekkkkkkkennn 8!
Why doesnt he catch the feather?!
Baki hanma please
Did he get some of Raven's moves? Like the diving kick and intro sequence?
Everything is good,🙂 except for commentary😠
Will there be a gameplay trailer with Devil jin
Its sounds like pride lady announcer isnt she? M
Love tekken 8 just dont like sf 5 and 6 nowadays.
This is one of the best games I have ver seen, although it’s a really good game
Can we get Baki this time. Y’all gave us effin Negan for Christ sake
Where can I find the song used in this trailer?
That is one solid food truck and the bystander doesn't move at all, how funny.
The hotdog stall at 1:09 is amazing🤣🤣
Goddamn he looks even more sick! sure im gonna main him again
the Main Character.
This is the first time that I've seen Jin having a acrobatic moves over the years which I'm a Jin player which he's my main character which his moves from Tekken 3 back on the days was Mishima style and on those current games was the Kazama style karate which his style was basic style of the karate with a traditional style but now he had a tumbling and acrobat movements that added to him which for what I've seen that I can't play or use Jin properly on his latest game Tekken 8 which I don't know much about to use his combos on the current game
Please change the announcer ugh
Downgrade: The game
I am SO ready for this game
Devil Jin's moveset are now a combination of his base form
Rush punch converted into one heavy punch
King?
The fact Kazuya has a full transformation and Jin literally activates his transformation during basic combat is crazy !! I hope they bring bacc  TEKKEN BOWLING … With new updated technology
Wow … we love you Jin 💯
It's like Jin has combined all 3 fighting styles together: Kazama, Mishima, and Traditional Karate
Джин - это уже целый культ, демонстрация мощности и полного контроля над ситуацией👍👍👍 в теккен 3 любил за него играть, правда он тугой в освоении боец, но когда научился им играть счастья было полные штаны, поражало то, что стоит сделать несколько хороших серий и противник уже на грани, так же не умеючи или не оценив противника можно было им легко проиграть, то есть это оружие в умелых руках, это не Эдди, где кнопки все тыкай и будут тебе комбо😂😂😂
That hot dog lady is the final boss,b!tch is literally unfazed.
Cant wait for mk12
Jin: "Power is everything."  Jun: "Say what again, son?"  *picks up slipper aims at Jin*  Jin: "Strength isn't everything."  Jun: "Now, that's a good boy!"
Jin now is some mix of Kazama Martial Arts, and Lars Tekken Force art
Jin rocking the one winged angel look now
Jin é o mais forte
Jin looks so cool but I like the way how the fused the devil and normal style
Not enough explosions
Harada harada harada…. Saving the jun trailer for last I see…
Jin has to be the only fighting game main character with 3 different movesets over the span of his franchise. His original Mishima-ryu fighting style (Tekken 3, which is now Devil Jin's) his Kazama-ryu fighting style (Tekken 4-7) and now this combined style.
Imagine being in the hot dog stand
The roster confirmed so far - Nina, Paul, Lars, Law, Kazuya, Jin......Please reveal Yoshimitsu next...please
I’m a diehard Kazuya fan bc he is just purely badass, but I like what they’ve done with Jin
The only reason I ever played Tekken was because Jin 😂💯
Love the new voice lines but i'm really gonna miss his DAH
1:10 El señor de la tienda: Pero que ha pasao !
Since 1997 to this day Jin still has black locks. ♠️
“I shall not waver again.” My dude Jin is looking better than ever, love it.
some people: *dislike the trailer*  me: 1:02
I like how there are new moves instead of constantly having new Tekken where only story advances, graphics slightly advance, and maybe some few additional new characters or character replacements. But moves for classic characters remain the same. Character in the story do grow, years get passed, they have learned more, refined some of the moves, poses, etc. Some classical moves remain, some developments have been made, etc.
WHAT IS THE MUSICCC
Is this gonna be have a Champaign story like previous series or just Player vs Player/CUP?
That finisher reminded me of Raven from Hinokakera: Fragment Eclipse
I almost hear Jin saying "ORA ORA ORA"
Imagine Jin's reveal trailer has as many views as the game itself. He sure is popular 💪
the new announcer voice is annoying af tho, I'd prefer the one from 6
Durryaaah💪🏾chya
Jin the new KOF character
Tekken abondoned it's best and most unique mode which sets it on another level compared to other fighting games which is it's tag mode they should add it in tekken 8 i really miss those cool combos tricks and moves you could do in tag mode and also you can have a backup player
Bring back that double spin punch from tekken 3 that you had to press 10 buttons to execute😂! My fav move from any fighting game ever.
the guy in the food truck doesn't care at all 😅🤣
I'm so happy my boy jin finally controls his devil gene 😢🥺🥺 it seems it was like the yesterday's rip tekken 3,4,5 and 6 such a great character development for him the hero we needed 😭😭
Jin Kazama the “One-Winged Angel” i mean the Lightning Of Fate
They need to continue with the show on Netflix . Is it Netflix or Hulu?
"Power isn't everything" - Tekken 8 on Switch anytime soon?
I want to see that Hot Dog master as a playable character. Watching two demons fighting right in front of you and you not even moving an eyebrow shows who is a real OP.
you cant beat tekken 3 with this animations.
Jin Kazama is the reason I play Tekken, can't wait for this!!!!
please bring back Tekken mobile…
1:09 lmao lol
Jin the goat
2 devils fighting each other meanwhile hot dog guy :🗿
JIN >>> ROCK HOWARD
1:11 The Food van guy didn’t give a damn to whole fight 💀
1:21 Reminds me of the TEKKEN 3 cover art
Did he take a page out of Heihachi ‘s book?
heihachi got old from tekken 2 to tekken 3. Jin is the same from 5 games/20 years
The guys on the hotdog stand : this is fine
So they’re making Jin-Lars.
Últimamente parecen los street fighter y los Tekken un killer instinto solo les faltan los fatalityes
Tekken 3 and Tekken tag were so much better. The game play is boring in comparison
ROCK
tekken end at season 3 stop hurt this game more
Soo we got Jin + lars now great 👍
In 2044 we need to do the combo ourself through VR
Add yujiro and baki on Tekken 8 Pleaseeee
I want to cosplay as jin so bad
I love tekken music
I am a diehard Kazuya fan, since Tekken 1. But it’s great to see what they’ve done with Jin. He looks great and incorporating his Devil abilities into his Kazama Style Karate is great, as well as the odd move inspired by his Father. 1:03 for example. Beautiful!
😁
Jin got that Rock Howard aesthetic now.
Jin in full control over his power is such a work of art
ohh yeah... lots of hype, how you gonna stop the cheating Bandai?
Wah makin keren aja Tekken 🔥🔥🔥🔥🌟
The GOAT, my main character
Don't judge me but I smell the same scent as Tekken 7 :(
와.. 진 😱  화랑은 언제 나올려나  😭
Jin seems way faster and everything is tight, might have to start playing him now, seems like a new character 0:55
THIS MUSIC IS EVERYTHING!!!
Jin's control of the Devil gene is insane! I love his new move list and how his character has developed to this point. Literally have had a crush on him since Tekken 3 came out when I was nine years old lol.
😭
I haven’t bought a ps5 because there wasn’t a new Tekken release Looks like I’m gonna have to get one now 😂
Will this game work on my hp8460p💀?
bring back scenario campaign
Street Fighter will have an extremely hard time competing with Tekken for this generation due to the heavily shitty and westernized aesthetic design choice. Tekken is staying true to its core and fanbase. I as an SF player will be completely moving to Tekken for this generation.
I don't like the graphic when the heat system of Jin they should improve the graphic of this and the trailer that come after the first Tekken 8 trailer the graphic some how change I like the first trailer graphic,it feel it is the real Tekken 8 graphic
that will be the narrator voice? :S
Jin swear he ragna
The best style of heroes and appearance was in part 3, you better stick to the canon and the origins!!!
I love every new move but not rage art. Its too small and not like kazuya.
Spider man and Jamie Foxx are fighting right beside them
1:21 take this?
What is the song played in the background: ) 🔥
SAME GAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Kiryu Kazuma and Tifa Lockhart please
1:22 Jin does his Dad's electric
WHERE IS MY HWOARANG'S GAMEPLAY?!?!?!
Damn y’all mixed the devil & devil jin move set with the Jin move set
I need this track lol.
that skinny cow is already very squeezed
Namco, it's been over a week since this trailer came out, can we have a new one please 😢🙏🏾
Man, Rock Howard looks a little different.
1:07 That crackpot hotdogs food truck is durable.
welp, see you next week
Well I might make the switch to this 1 winged destroyer now, seems like they've merged Jin and devil Jin moves. I wonder if he could transform in to full devil jin???!
whats with that random one wing thing going on lol.!
no new trailer *insert that Megamind meme
If mokujin aint in tekken 8 i aint buying dont play with me.. cant predict my next moves w him
My heaven, I think Jin is able to control evil spirit inside his body as well as Kazuya does right here right now in The Eighth King of Iron Fist of Tournement.
public the next oneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I never liked Tekken and it still looks like the same choppy movements I remember it for lol
PAUL solos
Kazuya has always been my fav Jin special does not seem all that the announcer sounds like a rip off of dbs broly but im excited for the game overall
i hate this Devil Jin in my Jin
I don’t understand why there isn’t a blood mode for these games. Would make it so much better
its time for the next trailer xD
Ok, there we have it. Now we're getting pretty much spot on with the first reveal trailer. I literally did side by sides and did some pauses and yes, they graphics are now FINALLY on the level of the reveal trailer. Holy hell this is looking awesome. Loving all the lighting and all the flashiness going on in the background of this stage. There's just so much going on while fighting it's insane. The stages are looking better than ever. I just absolutely DEMAND one thing and one thing only. All I really want is to have my BEACH stage.....there better be one in T8 so I can get my characters in beach wear and kick some ass.
Looks amazing
Буйство частиц и спецефектов ничего не разлядеть. Это драки ты должен ВИДЕТЬ оппонента что бы адекватно действовать. Но нет все в одной гамме с одинаковой детализированностью - персонажей очень сложно разглядеть/отделить от фона. Красный "чидори" просто заставляет мои глаза кровоточить.
Its been 8 days where the hell are the next trailers
Release Tekken 8 also on Playstation 4 please.
WOW! Tekken 3 is much better than this.
and tekken became dragon ball
TEKKEN 8 !!!
Wow, looks exactly like Tekken 7
I think we need more flare and particle effects
Most boring game ever
😍😍🤩 that's him
I'm surprised the guy selling hot dogs is still there
mf, the wait is kinda killing me
Wish they kept his tsu tsu tsu tsu tsu tsu combo punches
1 million views!? Damn... Glad to see the cute, momma's boy is back!
When will the graphics match the reveal trailer and the smooth frame rate...probably will never happen, until then, I'll sit this one out. Looks like Tekken 7 HD remake ....
HA! Jin trailer got 1 million views while Kazuya's just got 723k and people tell me Kazuya is more popular than Jin?    Stop the cap kaz fanbois
0:58 This move with that sound looks great!
THE ANNOUNCERS VOICE IS HYPE
I hope and prey  to Ogre  that they spent time on the story mode! I’ll help write
Nothing new or impressive to become like a Tekken 8... They launched it too soon, just more of the same...
Please Bamco I need the King trailer
As always music is goat
Girl in the hot dog van is like "Whatever. You buying something?"
CAN WE GET A RELEASE DATE PLEASE?!!!! I’ve been waiting so long. I’m ready to pre order and play and beat any and everybody like I do on 7.
Kazama ''One Million Views'' Jin!
Its been a week, next trailer please
Sick track
Jun needs to stop Jin and Kazuya
you should announce next trailer now
Can't wait for the Jin mains to ask for buffs
Should say, "Sparks aren't everything" instead. The excessive use of sparks obscures the actual hits and makes it less fun. Might as well just go watch fireworks.
I miss Heihachi😢
the animation look so crisp. damn!
Finally jin kazama this time more powerfull.. i have seen raven tecniue_and lee style moves_ex+mishima karate style and normal standart of Jin moves..this time battle changes_more stronger more stylish...👍
Power is everything.
we need some free characters in Tekken 7 after Tekken 8 release please...?
worst anouncer voice ever!
Its been 6 days now, a new challenger is approaching (probably)
Same as tekken 7
That hotdog stand lady is handling life’s obstacles quite well …. 🤔
Fantasy level 1000000
Waiting for the next one drop it
waiting for new trailer...
Atlus, you're my favorite developer right now. Your IPs, your collector editions, your localization work... But please, reasonable prices.
Before watching, I thought I didn't have epilepsy
I was nervous about the hotdogs 1:11
Did Jin just go sephiroth???
bro whos this narrator? 🤣🤣🤣
If his hellsweep no longer launches, it's still fine because the extension leaves the opponent face up, feet away, which is the worst downed position you can have in tekken. From there, you essentially get a free mixup, which is what they're really going for in t8 from everything we've seen so far
Still boring as hell, i stopped after Tekken5 and Tag Tournament was the best one.
Looks...not good.
50/100
Weak
Tekken movies please
Hope got for switch😊
A little too much flourish to the lightning/sparks/magical powers.
I am pretty sure that the fighting here is faster then Tekken 7
They need to get the old announcer back. “Get ready for the next battle” is too iconic to mess with
I know story is just an excuse for all online play but i dont like the fact that its so predictable he beats and kills Kazuya. Like reaaaalllly straightforward storytelling.
Damn, nice mix of all his previous styles, he looks alot more nimble now as well.
1:09 I'm fighting with my own blood for the sake of beating my own demons. Japanese babushka: Hell yea, hot dogs commercial!
Ужасно😮‍💨!!! Куча спецэффектов, из-за которых вообще ни чего не видно. Это вообще что, TEKKEN или Street Fighter. Я до сих пор считаю TEKKEN 3 лучшей игрой в серии!!!
Саске, вернись в Коноху!
IDK why but I feel like the Jin I feel in love with back in 2001 when I first played Tekken 3 is finally back. We finally have back the protagonist Jin.
Wouldn't be surprised it's the same as tekken 7😂
Muerta quedé
My theory... In this game the true final boss will be Devil, since Kazuya and Jin both share a bit of it. During their battle, somehow both parts will be reunited, and the one with power to defeat it will be Jin himself.
Disappointed  Kazuya Mishima is better than now from this character... Kazuya also look cool as well
The announcer sounds like Present mike from MHA Dub
Sorry Kazuya. But Jin is more stronger and awesome than you.
1 million views already.. and I'm here hoping KING shows up tomorrow
Will tekken 8 be available on ps4 too?
Tekkeeeeeeeeeen
I have always mainly played Jin in Tekken but, I never thought the day would come when we would get the chance to see him in control of the devil gene. I love this so much. I’m buying this game when it releases ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
His finishing move is ff+2  HAHAHAHA LAME
I never say "sheesh" this much in single video before. sheesh
why is he fighting like Lars ?
Why u guys do not remaster “URBAN REIGN” 😢
Jin seems to have some influence of Jun. I think he controlled his Devil genes too
Tekken Ball
where is next gen?
The narrator drives me crazy man. I hate that voice.
i quit play, cause heihaci dead
I don't like the announcer
Chef's kiss at his moveset and design,his rage art is basically Paul which is terrible.I'm not even kidding if Devil Jin doesn't have the best rage art in the game I'm gonna main Kazuya and I'm not even going to be sad about it because so far he looks the best!
Bryan Fury > Everything
Amazing! <3
Finally, a good looking Tekken!
I liked how he’s learning from his mistakes by saying “Strenth isn’t everything!”, when he used to say “Power is everything!”.
Didn’t he defeated Azazel in Tekken 6? The being was supposed to be the sorce of the Devil Gene. He destroyed Azazel, so why the the hell does he still has the Devil Gene?
Kekuatan adalah segalanya🙌🙌🙌🙌
Gets less and less realistic with every new title.
Xbox?
release date?
00:55 on headset with max bass is so satisfying
All these improvements are great but Bandai Namco need to work on cutting down those load times. Felt like we were waiting 10 days, every time we were 'getting ready for the next battle'.
Music is hype
nahhh this is HEATTTTT
Tekken lost kind of his essence. Too shiny, it doesn't look dark, like old school.  I guess people will like it, but for me it looks very artificial.
Jin is now officially the one winged devil
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING.  Jin's most OP move: Character development
For me is Tekken 3 the best Tekken 😢
Bruh this Jin is sick
King trailer next plzzzzz
Not going to waste money on this sausage fest of a game. The only good thing it ever had was player vs cpu in versus mode and that's gone. Tekken sucks now and it's repetitive story is boring.
I like how this short trailer was used to tell an important story, character developed 👏🏾
The Japanese really need to work on their smack talk.
Jin has grown! I feel like he has really tamed his devil gene.
Am I the only one annoyed by the announcer? It feels more like street fighters!
Jin Kazama is really went cool. I hope that Ling Xiaoyu will play main role in T8, at least she's looking for him, worry about him. By the way, between them emotional attachment
Doný like jin, but damn this looks cool !
SIck graphics for sure!
I hung up my console on tekken 4. but when i see juggles going wild i would love to get a new console and play again haha
Fire and Blue Lights effect very bad and unrealistic
The title says Tekken 8. But game on the video looks like Street Fighter О_о
I think tekken 8 truly change jin gameplay lmao. Not just adding combos this time but truly merging him with devil jin and his mishima tekken 3 style
говно! серию тупо испоганили!
If they bring Xiaoyu to 8, she should have Panda Assist like Kazumi's Pet Tiger.
I think I’m a Jin main now
Hectic
I dont know until now why does tekken never get same appearance with its wallpaper and when in game especially in face, from tekken 5 - tekken 8 like a fake, if you see DOA they consistently having a characters looks like that same with its walpaper.🤢🤢🤢
I hope the juggles are just this short.
Announcer gives Tekken movie vibes :D
Pretty much tekken 7 with added contrast
PS4 graphics level, in general, like the seventh part of the ps 3 level
Looks like the last few games . Can't believe they are bringing rage art's back . Cheap 3 button press for retarded players that aren't good at fighters
Is the announcer the same one from that gun from zenkaiger
downgrade
its tekken 7 with better effects
Pff... this is no longuer TEKKEN...that's tekken ball Z.
เมนจิน🤭🤭😊
I'm glad they stopped making Jin a goth kid
Tekken 3 ❤️
Looks good, but I'm just tired of juggling.
Can't wait for zenkaiger vs tekken
Looks cool but I really hope that you can tone down the particle effects; they're a bit too much at times
Always excited for yoshimitsu
A Times Square fighting stage?! Fantastic!   Now please bring back the Fiesta Del Tomate stage…  I miss stomping around and making marinara in my fights. 😊
I feel like Stev Fix will have a pretty slight dramatic hair change like a shorter fade cut or shaved on sides and mini slicked back or pomp and there will be more better combos and mix ups I feel he will be more crazy and fun then ever before can't wait
Looks awesome. I always wished they would bring back the tag tournament feature. The whole game doesn’t need to be tag, but I think if you could choose tag team or 1 on 1 it would be amazing.
Wang: “I’ve been telling you that since Tekken 5”
Dragunov to the studio))  😍
i find it funny that even though there's a police barricade, the hotdog vendors are still selling like it's a typical mondays lmao.
I'm gonna tell 2 things: 1. Scorpion defeats easily all of these assholes. 2. Stop playing games, kid rats!
Ojalá este juego salga para PlayStation 4 y Xbox One
If possible please launch in mobile
Saw some Devil jin moves in here. My wish to just have Jin n Devil Jin as one character who shares both moves might have been granted
Please fire the announcement guy. Either that or someone release his balls
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY FU MONEY
ive been a jin main since tekken 6 and still i havent mastered ewgf 🥲🥲🥲
My guy jin channeling that sephiroth energy with that one black wing
As much as I love Tekken it would be cool to smash into over areas just for something different.
Jin is Sephirothing big time
Welp     There goes my pc
Jin looks like he had plastic surgery for lips lol
He looks like he plays well. I may get back into tekken.
Boring  🥱
He may have started the war, became the devil himself, but now, Jin has evolved into the saint.
Bro, this game has taken everything original about Tekken out and more like every other fighting game!!
I'm sick of watching those rage arts already 😭
it seems there is no devil jin anymore  they took mixed them together
If Xiaoyu seeing this version of Jin, she will fall in love with him.
Damnnn Jin look Soo fine
Street Fighter 6 & Tekken 8 in the same year?! LET'S GO!!!
I loved Tekken because the realism, I can see why Tekken is not for me anymore xD.
Jin payback kazuya punch face
physics has left the chat... 2023 has come
Mortal kombat 12 will be better
Tekken x Baki Grappler
That song go crazy
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING.  And then turn devil mode on
Next trailer date
Huge Rock Howard feel
Man I love his jacket
I love Tekken but Street fighter is destroying you on content please just add Tekken force just do more than Tekken 7 because if you don't Street fighter going to destroy your guy's.
I like how they didn't ruin it looe street fighter
These type of games are ass and not evolved much  Tekken is the worst of this genre
One Winged Devil/Angel
Damn guys he's out of his emo phase
it doesnt look better than mk11
character development arc is real... 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
lo pondran a una resolucion aceptable esta vez? DIO ASCO VERLO CORRER EN XBOX A 720 MOVIENDO LA CONSOLA JUEGOS A 4K SIN ESFUERZO...  UNA VERGUENZA TEKEN 7.ESPEREMOS EL 8 ESTE A LA ALTURA.
Tekken overwatch dva
Sad thing about it. I be still doin old moves and still kickn butt without this flashy content.😅
dont like this flares and splashes on each and every strike! Thats why i do not like tekken at all. there should be an option to disable this effects! And completely remove 20hit combo while opponent in the air - its nonsense
Added some of that Devil Jin spice to those moves.
...for the first time, I actually WANT to play Jin. o_O
"Strength isn't everything"  That's character development right there
Man I don't like the new announcer voice
overamoomyiaramoo joder ...
I hope they make a street fighter X tekken 2
I play Tekken since Tekken 3 came out. I played it until tekken 6 and tag 2, but now I m glad I m not playing it....Tekken 8 became somewhat I don't like...Tekken was authentic for me and now looks like a Devil May Cry wannabe.
Is it me or they actually gave Jin some Lars movements? That would be cool since Tekken 7 story groups them. Having an actual decent story with some development reflected on the moveset would be DOPE
Jin is using kazama styles now!?
MUITO SEM GRAÇA.
My question still remains. I got fussed at in a reddit forum for asking haha but since Jin has control over the devil gene does this mean that Devil Jin as a stand alone character still exsists?
same game :/
Still look like character renders from Tekken 4 meaning your characters look like video game models from 3 console gens ago.............. in 2023/2024. Why can't you do what Netherealm does and go back and build them from the ground up every time? And the WORK they put into every single character intro interacting with other characters is incredible. What do yous be doing 7 years between Tekken releases????
Jin is Kenny Omega? He's the one winged angel!
It's time for Taken and Mortal Kombat to face off.  Nothing else matters at this point.  Tell Ed Boon step it up for next gen.  Another bullshit game
The graphics get better and better, very impressive. But still the oldscool mechanics, punch-kick sounds and exagarated juggle balistic.
Can't wait to play fighting games Tekken 8 & Street Fighter 6 on my coming Switch 2. CAN'T WAIT 😍🤤💪
He looks older here like in his 30s lol
Good I hope the lame Devil Jin character is gone for good.
tekken 7 2
Animation looks awesome! BTW is it the announcer from MMA Pride events?! Sounds great!
What's the difference between this game an Street Fighter? Nothing? What boring garbage. Wouldn't buy this even when it becomes $20.
My favorite character!
i couldn't remember the voice actor, i heard him elsewhere i think
chloe reveal pls
Where is baki hanma????? Bakiiiii
What is this Dragon Ball 12 year old wet dream bullshit? This used to be a martial arts game.
1:26 gearing up to enter dat ass ;)
1:21 👊🏿his🍆
tekken 7 looks awesome
Jin > kazuya. Time to kick daddys ass AGAIN 😁
jins rage art is missing the lighting from the first trailer
KAZAMA JIN
Now this is a kazama not that devio bs
Какая позорная анимация крыла этого. Просто как будто в пейнте нарисовали. Уровень графики первого ролика кажется более высоким, чем все последующие геймплейные.
virou a porra do Lair
The fight between Jin and kaguya would be more intense than heihachi fight because we will actually get to see devil users clash, and not only devil users, but they basically wield the same devil gene. Half of kazuyas devil went to Jin. Looking forward to this.
Looks nice, butt keep the anime stuff subtle.
Комбинация двух Джинов в одном - это хорошо, отсутствие какой либо деформации одежды в 2023 году это однозначно минус
Damn this is how I felt tekken 6 a decade ago😢😅
He was beaten some sense into him so bad he went back to being his likeable self from Tekken 3.   Thanks, Miguel!
MK is better
So Jin fully controls the devil inside him.
Jun better be similar
Can I please buy this jacket!! 🤩🤩
Jin before: Power is everything Jin now: Strength isn't everything
Is it just me, or is he using Kazama style+ Mishima Style + Lars' moves. this game is going to be LIT!!!
same game
And here I thought if they could've updated  tekken 7 into tekken 8 instead of making a new paid game for purchase xD
No way man luigi is in smash bros who would’ve thought
1:09 Will Jin be reimbursing that poor lady's hotdog vehicle??? these kazamas truly are detestable.
Jin gives the impression of Iori Yagami here.. lol
Following since tekken 1. Continuous development. This is an AMAZING FIGHTING GAME!!
fck the effect.. so epic
Need new blood characters , why they still count on old people
Now I can see my ass kicked in style.
Just watching this make my eyes bleed. Why it have to be so much particular effects in fighting game?
So we arent getting devil jin as a separate character 😢
Most OP character.  Guy selling Hotdogs.
Seeing jin use marshall's flip kick tho 😮😮
Tekken always been a dope as fighting game
Na este juego es dios yo todavia ando jugando el tekken 3
Jin until tekken 8: Strength is everything! Jin in tekken 8: Strength isn't everything!
Jin has always been my favorite character... but what they did to him, is nothing short of Iconic.
"Power isn't everything"
Jin is finally merging with his inner Devil, Nero style. Very cool.
I like how the hotdog vendor is just casually standing there while a person is being thrown into his truck
F for main devil jin
Ew these announcers get worse and worse
Im not much of a jin player but i have to give props cuz his gameplay looks good and kazuya too I'm lookin forward to this game.  Bring my uncle leroy back lol(heh heh heh leroy voice)...lol.
왤케 유치하게 바꿔놧냐. 쿠사나기 쿄를 만들엇노
MY HUSBAND LOVEEEEE
ลง  KOF all-star หน่อย70 6ตัว ของคุญ NEW
Ok now Paul please
Tekken King is Jin Kazama
Where is baki?
Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam 🔥❤️🔥🇩🇿
1:07 poor ice cream truck
Tekken 6-7 : "Power is everything" Tekken 8 : "Strength isn't everything" Tekken 9 : "Everything is everything"
So far, I am loving every single trailer for Tekken 8.  However, I am kind of getting afraid if the gameplay will have that much camera shifts.
Felt like I was watching street fighter gameplay for a bit
very original character. This is groundbreaking! I can see him stay until Tekken 69.
Can I pre order yet? I need this in my life 😭😭🤙
Bro tekken 8 came fast as hell i haven't even played tekken 7 yet im just now getting done with tekken tag tournament 2.
Date come out
I dunno. Its the showcase fight and it still look like Tekken 7. Is there really a need for a 8th mainentry?
1:01, please add some new moves for the heat move. Jin only does one slam and that's it...
Not gonna lie his special attack sucks but ima still get and enjoy the game
*This sucks! This is like the FastandFurious9 of Tekken; this style of gameplay is very far removed from what made Tekken famous in the first place, and plays more like theKingofFighters.*  *Remember when Tekken3 first came out and how much of a step-up it was compared to the preceding Tekken2? Well, this new Tekken massively sucks to pull that off.*
I think this Tekken is over exaggerated we were asking a balanced, Tekken 7 not all of that
Looks very good but am I the only one that noticed the female character graphics don't look as good as the guys?
i see nothing special especially for next gen . we buying cuz we fans nothing more
00:57 - 01:02 looks like Jin's been training with uncle Lars.
Tekken lost identity after part 5
Now that was very cool! I mean, he has matured and he's looking like the protagonist.   Once it was but now, "power isn't everything".
Pls bring back the ability to pick your own stage on online play.
I'm getting Ryo Sakazaki vibes from Jin's climax.. Ryo in Tekken please!
Classic Title Name from Tekken 3 til Now it’s returning and Official Jin Kazama Tekken Fighter Nickname is:  “ *Lightning of Fate* ”  and Jin Kazama: Strength Isn’t Everything it’s been likeliest journey to experience from 26 Years of Tekken 3 first debut appearance for the TEKKEN Series.  But Let’s go 🔥🔥🔥 We’ve got Jin Kazama back so I’ll wonder who will be joining Next In the TEKKEN 8 💙🔥❤️ Gameplay 🎥 Trailer but I’m still excited to have my low expectations for his Classic Movelist like the Command-Inputs and his Special EX ability is combining of mix to Jin Kazama and Devil form Kazama / Mishima–Fighting style but Yes. I’m in point of fact agreeing this’ll be guaranteed to happen I’m going to say that TK8 will be officially coming out to this year whichever one they’ll do I’m pretty sure it’s Late 2023 release or Summer 2024 which might possibly mean June ☀️ is that okay Making-decision IP plan with this Document 📃 leak for TEKKEN 8 game launching In June 4th, 2024.
trop de lumières dans les coups ! C'est bordélique !
The most badass he's ever been !  Can't wait for Bryan's trailer !  *_*
Aah yeah. That's really clean ngl
Harada please it's a humble request please have a look I'm a big fan and the first game I ever played on my PC was Tekken I love it There are some rumors that devil Jin will not be in Tekken 8 and if that's true we really need a command to transform jin into half devil form just like kazuya in the mid of a battle during heat mode please confirm it soon that we will be able to do it or not I love Tekken Katsuhiro Harada sir and please please please have a look at this humble request     Anyone agree?? Yess? Drop a like please ❤️❤️🔥🔥
I just got tekken 7 AGAIN since giving mine away. Thinking this 8 will never happen 🤦🏽‍♂️
Nice...but Where is the NEW challenge ?? hahaha
My boi looking dangerous 😳
I hate the announcer so bad
Spicy super spicy 🔥💯🔥
Low level trolls calling it Tekken 7 with bigger budget. Look at Call of Duty. At least Tekken 8 is doing something different, sure the game play mechanism are the same but so is CoD (literally every CoD game).
Ah, I see. He’s an amalgamation character.
Jin Kazama is looking more powerful than ever wow
Loved the reaction 😂😂😂
Fun fact :       Jin voice actor also voiced DIO in capcom 1999 heritage of future game
Looks like mortal kombat not Tekken
Sidestep trailer.
Okay everything looks great but is this really the announcer we are going with lmao
THAT’S OUR BOY!!!
Oh yeah now he has all of his moveset including Tekken 6 and 7 Devil Jin. Gonna spam Jin now.
But still power and strength is two different thing and i agree strength isn't everything but yeah POWER IS EVERYTHING
Show
Amazing... eagerly waiting for Tekken 8
Strength is Not everything, this is .. damn🔥. Your proved Bandai Namco that you hear your gamers.
LETS TEKKEN BOYSS!!!!!1
When will come the next tag tournament 😕
Ладно в 2003 играть в это , но в 2023 это просто дно
WHY IS TEKKEN 8 MAKING ME LIKE JIN AND KAZUYA?? I HATED THEM IN 7-
0:27 Jin Kazama: Chicken soup.
Jun might be awakening Jin's inner self it looks like. A mother's bond is much stronger than a father bond to a son.
Disappointing where are the moves that's only lighting effects you can't see punches and combos only lights these new developers and graphic designers just destroying these great games just like need for speed unbound a shity racing game 🤬
i hope people wont get mad at my comment. but i really don't understand the thrill in playing fighting/arcade/versus games like this. its basically the same thing with its older versions. with only improved graphics new characters and some new moves. just like racing games, or sports games basketball/football/soccer. it is an endless loop of repetitions.
يا ان القيم بلي فيه كميه ادرنلين مي طبيعيه 💀
Release now!
Is official, now Tekken = MK
かっこいい
Explosive!!!😍
غيرو مؤدي صوته
I wonder what the name of the ost is
is like tekken7 but with mor lights
And.. For the next Capcom vs. Namco game Dante and Vergil vs.  Jin and Kazuya.
Isn't it about time for Jin to have a son now?🤔
They put times Square in the game.... and fights like this happen daily there... just like the game
LETS GOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭
"I shall not waver again." BRUH NOTHING TURNS ME ON MORE THAN CHARACTER GROWTH
Feels like a 2d fighter, in none of the trailers have I seen a single side step.
Book so wet right now 🤣
When Lars said „You can do this, Jin Kazama!“ he meant doing backflips in his combos
Jin rocking Sephiroth's one-winged angel look.
SHEEEESSHHHH...ORAAAAA ORA
Julia chang 🥺 please News challenger
Do the screws and bounds look kinda iffy
Uhh, so he looks like Lars a bit. Wtf?
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️Tekken 8  ✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️✊️🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Can I play this on my PS4 PRO???
Absolutely badass. ❤‍🔥
1:08 That hot dog guy be like 👁️👄👁️
Jesus is real He loves you  and wants you to come to Him today.He's coming back very soon..Hell is real that's why He died for us that we do not perish but to have everlasting life and relationship not a religion with Him. He will help you if you just believe💕  If you want to become saved pray this to God:  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  John 3:16    For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.  John 6:35   Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.  Revelation 20:15   And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.   in Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.  He loves you💕
That hotdog stand withstood the punches from Jin  Virgils Plastic Chair: "Ah yes, a worthy opponent!"
did he do Devil Jin attacks and Lars' Somersault kick?
I will not waver
What in the Sephiroth-
sigh more cant see the final hit of the rage art bs
Wish they'd release the full song of this trailer already, sounds like a banger
the stageeee 🔥
И что там будет нового, всё одно и тоже в каждой части, бойцы и спец приёмы одни и тежи 😏
Great.
I hope the referee's voice can be set to the old one
2014 graphics, nice
We Want Marshal Law Trailer of 2 Or 3 minutes
Paul's karen hair already grew on me. But this annoying ass announcer will never be. Hope I can shut him up in the game.
AAAAAARGGH!!! This is perfect!!!
Loved the change in Jin's body language. He's either immature, pretty depressed and down in all previous entry after 3 but he looks very confident and mature in this one
Ok jin is Blood stinger now like Iori Yagami 😅
Look at my son having that DOG in him! Plus true character growth, this is the most over the top Jin has been in a while and i'm here for it!
Huh it's like they switch move
Somersault Kick?? 🤔
This looks like all the others …
1:06 that hotdog truck is the most indestructible object there. The lady inside is not even bothered.
Dont ever remove that intro
I'm really loving the announcers enthusiasm. I'm glad they chose a light hearted yet vocal voice for the pre-match intros. Can't wait to get my hands on this game.
Amazing 💪🏻🔥
Warning: Virgin comments overload
Jin went for a long ride with this curse. The fact he is controlling his devil gene and implementing it on his combat style says how much he has evolved. "Strength isn't everything." That line says enough.
Really digging how the trailers are all in the same style/format. That music kicks ass too!
not impressed samething and endings come on!!
Everybody : focusing on Jin Trailer. Me : focusing on MMA Ring Announcer Ms. Lenne Hardt aka Pride FC Lady Voice. When Pride FC nostalgia hits you that hard makes you feel that Jin steps into the ring to defeat Emelianenko Fedor to revenge Mirko ^^
Rock Howard vibes..
Show us Jun Kazama gameplay!!🖤🤍🐦
Look at him in control of the Devi Gene!! Yaaaaas!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Weak.... I
"Needs more light FX"  Said nobody, ever....
OK...... DLC is Rock From  Garou: Mark of the Wolves (He have other side wing)
I love how he has some crazy Lars kicks, nice lore touch!
But where's Baki at?
The best
Awesome!
The air/space/anti-gravity combo still exist…. I’m too old for this game… i stick with Tekken 2,3
Gotta Admit his moves are super cool Red Lightning 🌩 he's my second favorite character in Tekken but I just don't get that move 0:59 did he learn that from Hoawarang 🥋?
Kazuya and Jin's costumes are over-designed and way too busy.
New combo
I see Bob's Burgers finally made it in the big city!
YEYUS! the next generation of Devil Gene fighters! hopefully he'll win the tournament like he did in Tekken 5 but uses his skill for good
Is it true Baki the grappler is in this?
My boy kazuya😢
Jin is always looking so damn good. The moves, punches and kicks are sick!
Jin would NOT have sonned Kazuya like that! Idc idc idc!
jin looks like a beast
honestly that announcer isn't it.
I dnt like how the announcer sounds.
Did he said " Mata sena younada " ??
Bring back tekken force mode
Wtf is this announcer ? Awful af
Strength isn't everything and then beat the sh*t out of Kazuya 🤣🤣
This is the best tekken 8 trailer hands down, Jin looks so freaking cool in this game I might actually try him out.
It looks like Saints Row became a fighting game
Saints Row The Tekken?
Jin looks like he can defeat Goku
This looks like trash.  Hate how Tekken got all cartoony over time and the graphics don't really look like next gen.
Tekken is now Naruto / Dragon Balls. Announcer sucks. Gameplay sucks. Music sucks. The game isn't out yet and it already sucks dicks in hell. Give me back the old classic Tekken.
Next character: Miguel Caballero Rojo !!!!!!!!!
Why i think the voiceover opening so annoying?
😯😯😯😯
Some of the particle effects are a little too much, but looks cool!
Gosh this game is pathetic
0:36 JDCR be like : "Dragunov ??!"
Tekken of fighters
It's not character development, it's character regression. He's going back to the old Jin. T6 was character development (a new Jin)
Music is epic wtf, I’ve been playing Tekken since 1995 and people don’t credit the insane music production that much since the very beginning 😂😅
Can we get a damn release date for this masterpiece!!!!
I'm sorry for that poor dude in the hotdog stand
Ultimate Jin
Looks Stunning
If only they would let him fully transform in to devil jin would be the first time ever in a tekken game that they weren’t two separate characters
This game gets wicked
could break big rock by punch but cannot break hot dog booth
I really respect the food vendor for not leaving the truck🤣
Damn thats one STURDY hot dog cart
I guess I'm crazy for saying I don't like the super flashy art and cutscene mixed with fighting cause l don't see anyone else complaining haha
I wonder if they are going to bring Christie Monteiro back I missed her in tekken 7
Reminds me of sol and his gear form its amazing
Wow it's exactly like the other 7
when will tekken 8 come out?
think that tekken 8 May be a end for a entire era makes me sad.... but the final battle with this awesome style is making me crazy , tekken forever!
No me gustaaaa, parece street figther.
Baki
As someone who's never touched this series, Jin has always been the most unapologetically unironic edgy character I've seen in a fighting game. And I kinda love it.
sheeesshh, already surpassed the views of Kazuya's trailer -in this channel at least- ?
Is that Lenne Hardt? o_O
After chance 1 u get….@0:27
Nice.
You can tell Jin has come a long way. He’s seems humble now
Payback for Taking his spot in ssbu.
Essas animações de luz nos ataques está exagerado demais desde o Tekken 7, nem da para enxergar direito os ataques dos personagens, sem contar que tira o realismo do combate
I hope this means the end of Devil Jin as a separate playable character
After the last Tekken. No thanks. I tried it, lost to someone who bought a quick combo, and now I'll never play another Tekken again. Tekken 6 and earlier are still fantastic and you can go away with your garbage. You've already drove off a long time fan.
Love that plot-wise they're going back to the roots with some of the characters. Nina's trailer called her Silent Assassin again and her character description said she didn't enjoy hurting people similar to her pre-amnesia self. Jin is called "Lightning of Fate" here again which goes back to his debut in Tekken 3.
Akuma 2.0
I may be Team Kazuya but it feels good to see Jin come this far.
We need Baki in this bih!
i can't believe i'm saying this but... please give me back the journalist announcer from tekken 7.
he indeed did not sugarcoat it
I’m so excited!!!
plz do good netcode
Jin looking good! He’s finally in control of his devil gene power!? I wonder, how he learned to control that power.
he's literally me
Jin Kazama is awesome hes my Favorite character in Tekken
Jin is now one with the Devil Jin (Gene) tapping to his full potential... and also seen here is now the integration of the Mishima Style fighting along with the Kazama Style of fighting... he has truly come far from Tekken 3 and the lore!
track id?
So does this mean Devil Jin won't be playable? He is using some of Devil Jin's moves
ऋऋ
Very good
Está bueno... Pero siento que el Jin se volvió más Lars con el tiempo
I just saw an error in the game. If they wanted to make it more realistic, the street vendor's food stand should've been destroyed. I guess the programmers left that one out so they could save more space for the action sequence.
Can’t wait to see Claudio!
Please tell me you can smash your opponents thru walls again 🧱
I'm glad Jin got over his Linkin Park phase. Its cool, it happens to all of us.
I want that jacket
jin got guile's flash kick lmao
Tekken 8 is looking genuinely amazing
I feel like the best compliment I can give Jin here is that he's giving major Rock Howard vibes, and I'm so here for it
The only logical conclusion to the tekken storyline is Heihachi ultimately wins and throws jin and kazuya into a volcano.
from the abundance of effects, I almost caught an epileptic seizure
It looks so good 😫😫😫😫😫😫
He is so sexy ❤
Kyokushin karate 🤜
i need this song right now
I really need to be able to listen to this music on its own
Like the God of war, the cycle ends here.
tekken 8 fast n furious.  Particles, cause we can.
Mortal Kombat > Tekken
Wtf..I liked the initial badass fight trailer more....this is way too flamboyant for Tekken.
Why  tf is there a leroy smith statue thats all i wanna know... i dont want this bum back in the game
Our boy Jin has come so far 😢 The evolution of Jin Kazama has been so beautiful to watch.
Damn 1 winged angel
Lars nexttttt , hoping you fixed him , while keeping his aggressive combo style of gameplay <3
i can´t wait for Steve <3
It really feels like the characters got stronger.
Hwoarang Trailer pls😅😅
"Strength isn't everything." *Proceeds to break bones with overwhelming strength*
Lol he's already revealed in the reveal trailer of tekken 8
Looks like - as with 7 - my first customization will be to change the hair. 😂
No blood damage of faces why?
Is it just me? Tk graphic has been improving over the years but to me, it’s actions has never been that smooth or flow well, just not that natural
Yessss a non emo jin with his personality from T4/T5 back!!!
dafuq? they fused Jin and Lars?
🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴😴
It’s time to show a new stage 🌚
that poor hotdog vendor lmao, watching their stall being relentlessly assaulted I imagine them going like "so you wanna hotdog or what"
Aside from the game play, I can't wait for how the story & mishima lore continues
jin has turned into guile
DOPE
Jin now doing Noctis's Flare Drive 😅
We never got Tekken X SF but atleast we seem to be getting Tekken X FantaVision.
Give me Anna Thx
Awesome stuff! But this announcer is gonna need a mute button.
Does anyone need more than 60 FPS for this game?
Karate Jin is best Jin!
Shut up and take my money!!!
Very hate note good boring plz next dlc mokujin angel ya brush Eddy divel add rage 2 divel form not kauzya is better cool 😎 nice great asowme best ever loved 😍 op kauzya
I don't know what to say, this is the GOAT!
Pls just fix this stiff ps1 falling animation 0:47 everything else is fine.
Is it just me or did Jim have the same flipkicks or at least similar to Larz
I love this more mature Jin.
almost nothing has changed compared to 20 year old PS
IF IT AIN'T KING I AIN'T READIN' ALLAT🗣️🗣️‼️‼️
imagine if there is Bruce Irvin too
Cool
Tekken has so many classic characters. Looks amazing next gen only graphics
Overpowered jin
진짜 개별로다
Ништяк Импакт!
I love how the person in the hotdog truck just chilling inside while the truck just getting destroyed by them lol😂
Tekken 8 Geese and Akuma is back please bro
New moveset looks great
Not too sure that I like this. I saw a few of his signature moves in this rage drive showcase. I hope Namco hasn't placed them behind a "Charge-Up Pay Wall" like they did the characters in Soul Calibur 5 and 6 :/
So bound to the ground is back??
wait. i feel sorry for the guy selling hotdogs. 🤣💦
I think Jin is trained by Lars since he's doing air backflips now
1:09 I love how the girl in the hot dog van doesn't give a f*** what happens
lars buff
Happy days incoming..............
Is the battlefield Times Square or something lol
Ну и дальше что?
Playing Tekken 8 will now be COMPLICATED just by watching those move set, it's not like an arcade game anymore...more like an RPG already.. Did they start to put a Street Fighter touch?? 🤷🤦
He has full control over the devil gene, but that would mean Devil Jin won't be a playable character
King game play pls
Зачем он губы накрасил перед боем ? Или он собирался на гей вечеринку но решил по дороге избить бомжа ? 😅
Cool to see Jin supress his Devil form! 🔥
Meh, I'm over it.
: ( .....
Hope Steve in it
Graphics is a lot better, yet the rest.. Lets just say they still have a long way to go.
а без такого кол-ва искр и спецэффектов быдло не схавает?
Even tho i'm not good at this game, but this game looks so freakin awesome, cant wait to play it... Really bandai namco doing such a beautiful job right here.
Steve next guv!
niceee!!!! it would be awesome if they made the interaction better with the hot dog van IMO!
street fighter
Looks insane, I can’t wait! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE CHANGE THE ANNOUNCER VOICE!!!! It’s terrible!!
I'm still stuck on the one white feather he dropped at the end of tekken 4
0:28 I like the announcer, gives me PRIDE screaming lady vibes.
Hopefully we will also get separate devil jin and kazuya characters, especially devil kazuya, haven't been able to play as him since tekken tag 2. Namco I hope you see this comment.
Why does he only have one wing?🤔
0:34 hold on, is this King's cartoon mask from Tekken 5/6?
This honesty makes excited to play the game once it comes out
The Hotdog vendor : Quiet the hell down you devils. Can’t you fokin see I’m busy here? Don’t make me come out and shove the hotdogs up your fokin arses.”
i love that he's literally become his own opposite. he used to think strength and power was everything, but now he knows it isnt.
Not as good as the reveal trailer. Also, we known nothing about the online system. Games as GGS proved Tekken obsolete in that department, and so far we ignore if any advance was made.
Bro I'm ngl the new announcer is ass I want the old deep voice ready for the next battle back it sounds so much better
My fav char sweet
Troppe luci ed effetti luminosi.
Jin looking like he is in 30+ while his actual age is 23. He had a hard life...
They only thing I took away from this trailer is the hotdog vendor at 1:09 not reacting to the mayhem. It's just another day selling hotdogs at hotspot where fighters brutally beat each other.
tmm says Kazuya's outfit looks better than Jin's... delusional clown
Kazuya: I control everything Jin: strength isn't everything
Kazuya > Jin
Tekken so good it should expand out of pvp they could even do like a open world yakuza style game with character creation or even like a devil may cry style game, the lore's all there tekken just needs somethin new
all of his stances to attacks combined! so excited.
Jin kazama pra mim tá no mesmo nível do cr7
1:08 “Yo bro tryin to sell hot dogs here”
Bass drops are just too few and far between, lol. :)
am I the only who noticed Jin's eyes glowing like a "you are already dead" meme? time stamps: 0:40..1:09
I still love Jin's rage art from T7
What about Zafina?
No more DJ?
Talk about conquering your demons 😄 Good for Jin. This version of him looks sick
Can the guy age though? He's looked the same for 5 games now.
Guys I just have one complain that they add too much vfx in this game we can’t even see fight clearly now if anyone agrees with me reply they should make visual effects mush less than this everywhere I see is light
Fun fact: Jin and Kazuya are Nephilim. The devil gene is the gene of fallen angels. Jin and Kazuya's ancestor is Azazel--one of the fallen angels who lived on Earth during the Antediluvian period.
now I just need to see king gameplay and law
2d inspiration and Heihachis Omen. Yep, he's the Protagonist.
Wow I haven’t been hyped like this for tekken in years 🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me or the graphics really looks not much better than Tekken 7?
omae wa mou shindeiruXD
Is this only for the P5 ?
I like how he's kinda like akuma, just a tiny bit...
WE'VE GOT GOOGOL+FIGHTERS  JUST YOU WAIT  WAIT AND SEE STOP HAMMER TIME AND+AMEN
1:10 the whole stand is rocking except the person inside it. I hate noticing stuff like that lol.
*My guy went from "power is everything" to "strength isn't everything." Just shows his character development.*
DIS NIGGA JIN WHIPPIN DA DEVIL GENE LIKE HE OWN IT
This game still moves like ps1 games . Should be smoother
🅰️🅱️🆎🅾️🩸
Looks like tekken 7
1:10 the guy in the hotdog stand is just happy to be here
Man out here being tekken sephiroth😂😂😂
Is the 12fps? Lol
Jin Kazama is saint
nice jin have low punch now
If only Mishimas weren't hard as hell to play
I really like how most if not all the Mishima Style moves he performs shows his devil wings, indicating that it's the evil half he's learned to control
1:17 Jin's EWHF faster than Kazuya's  Dorya?
I hope they won't bring in a new Mishima karate student simply out of the fear that players will feel there aren't enough Mishima characters now, as Hei and DJ are gone (with some of their stuff mixed into Kazuya and Jin, respectively). Probably not, as the whole 1 button combos thing already hints at high execution not being a priority.  One cosmetic thing I dislike is the electric effect following the fist's trajectory, kinda like in SFxTK. It was always cool, since the first game, how the Uppercut/Wind God Fist seemed to almost create a kind of a "vacuum," with electricity appearing next to the right leg afterwards.
WTF? JIN IS BROKEN IN THIS FUCKING GAME HOLY SHETT!
Is that Lenne Hardt from Pride?
When will this release?!?!??!
Must be taking lessons from Rock Howard on energy wing presentation.
Sempre incazzatissimo Jin 😆
Hwoarang next please
There goes his wicked power-up pose again.
I like the soundtrack
Why is there too much light and fire... Like you can't see anything... I don't know even in slow motion there are too many blinding sparks .....
Seems kinda weak compared to Kazuya's trailer.
Everything is awesome about gameplay but 1:08 whats the fault of hotdog stall in Jin vs kazama ?
This looks like the best version of Jin in history of this series *_*
Glad he got over his evil dictator phase. End pose reminds me of Rock Howard which is cool
alisa next thx
Looks wack, Jin players always been sus , you know what I mean
1:08 I like how hotdog stand staff still chill after his cart is shaking crazily
tendangan sama pukulan puter2 jin udah ga ada ya?
Enough already geez
I hope they bring Miguel back in this game ☺️
MAAAAAAAX!!!! HAHAH
Jin looks sick af. But GOD I hate the new announcer voice
Awesome Tekken 8 Jin Kazama Gameplay Trailer.
Not really sure what to think. Guess I'll need it in my hands.
Tekken gameplay is so trash tho 😔
Devil may cry vibes
So basically everyone has meter in this game ? I wonder how much HP you’ll have
I hope this new announcer grows on me
We’re all talking about Jin’s character development of “Strength isn’t everything” but can we talk about the fact he now uses parts of the Mishima Karate Style in his moveset? Now that’s some visual character development right there!
damn car hot dog can't be destroyed 🤣
All the high jump kicks that does  looks like lars
Foolishness Jin, foolishness. Strength is indeed everything.
I don't like seeing Kazuya get his ass kicked like that.
90% of these comments are the same but worded differently
Wow! Tekken 8 looks amazing. I can't wait until more characters on the roster are shown.
Isn't it irritating to see the Ground breaking every time a character falls over or it's just me?
Cant wait for *YOSHIMITSU!*
Prime Jin right here
Jin sounds like he's on the rebound personality-wise.
Devil Jin once lose to Panda so Jin learn something from Panda. (Canon) "Strenght isnt everything" = "Teirlist isnt everything"
Jin pulling off flips because he is happy that his mom is back.
Im happy for them not to rush this, because its masterpiece
hearing the PRIDE Lady, Lenne Hardt, herself utter "JIIIIINNN KAZAMAAAA" was so utterly beyond badass. best Tekken announcer and the game isnt even out.
man went from Power is everything to Strength isn't everything  look at my boy grow
Fist meets A$$  👊
I can definitely see i street fighter cross tekken 2 happing
I think all Jin wanted was just a hotdog but Kazuya didn’t want to buy one.
That wasn’t a rage art style finisher at the end, was it? Say it ain’t so.
Maaaaaaaax
Next trailer goes to jun kazama probably on 8-9 march or 9-10 march.
Kazuya is still better lol
Jin is basically the new mascot for Bandai Namco so he sports the logo colours
I'm all for eddi
not ps4
Very stylish combos
Devilster is playing this on a loop until release day
0:57. Jin's heat smash is amazing a five hit natural combo and vertical tailspin. actually more powerful than kazuya's heat smash which is a low sweep(no launch).
looks sick. love the camera angles, the animations, the graphics, styling, and cant wait to see what mechanics have been changed
теккен 3 ремастер нужен народу !
Can y’all pls put the soundtracks back on Spotify?!
son of a fucking bitch, I just bought 7
Gut checking the entire roster good lord
1:10 is that heihachi omen god fist?
Naaaah y'all got it that looks like torture combo after combo Majin is going to have a blast with king then
Reminds me of Rock Howard
😎🥊🐵⚡
Do you have a release date yet?
when will be released?
But I don't like the announcer voice
That was rock howards stance...is that a fuckin hint
I can't wait to see bryan!!!
Why am I getting Lars vibes
"I shall not waver again"  So, no wavu wavu?
So we just not gonna talk about Jin’s omen coming back that’s wild!
OMG Jin sera bien fun à jouer dans ce Tekken 8 😲
poke poke, Juggle juggle , spam poke juggle , oh cool special,  poke poke juggle..........k......
cant wait to get back to maining my Miguel on this 🔥🔥
Jim Main 🤟🏼🔥
when is this coming out, im ready to lock in
I see this is going to be crazy
*Bandai Namco give us Baek Doo San, Bruce and Prototype Jack back !!!*
That was siiiick
This game’s gonna be great.
Jin has done was his father Kazuya could never have. Finding HUMILITY, and being a decent person.
Why no one talks about the announcer? Sound shitty to me
Games these days have TOO MANY bits. The graphics are so good that I cannot see everything going on, and thus information is hidden from me, such as in real life. For example, when a magician fools me by overwhelming my senses with stimuli just to simply move and object out of my view, I cannot comprehend every visual stimulus on screen. It's just too much. I have no idea what is happening.
Tekken X Street Fighter!! We got the new gen consoles with enough power for this to become a reality! 💪🏽👍🏽😎
Super sexy I like it 😮
Ryu and Jin finally overcoming their demons I'm so proud of them both. Edit: I really don't care who could be who I'm just happy they're moving forward
Hell yeah 🔥❤️
I could hear Devilster making an evil laugh while coming up with new strategies for Jin's combo 😏
I love that he looks more japanese and less white this time lol
As a Tekken fan: Awesome.  As a Kazuya fan: Boo...Boo Jin...Boo Jin Kazama. Boo. Boo. Jin. Boo.
Gosh this style of trailer is so old and played out.
Finally JIN get those moves which is he deserve
BATTLE MODE is what I want to play!
alternate title: Jin beats the ever living hell out of his father for 1 minute and 55 seconds
Jin Howard.
Seen father and son. Now I gotta see baby brother next.
cool hit particle. but its too much covering the screen
dayuuum this is gonna be fun
Please tell me this will be on PS4 and Xbox 1
THIS HAS SOME INSANE GRAPHICS  WHO AGREE 👌
I really hope this doesn't mean devil jin won't be his own character because that's been one of my favorites for a while now, I love that he can control it but please let devil still be a separate character
Jin’s bangs lookin like he’s ready to sing Selena covers
High hopes for this one. Wasn't a huge fan of 7.
Release date please
OMFG He has fully controlled the devil power!. From his initial "Power is everthing." and going crazy murder mode in the main storyline in the previous game to this new "Power isn't everything!" Can't wait!
1:33 Jin with the Rock Howard swag
The guy in the hot dog truck doesn't seem very worried. Must be a Mishima player
From tyrant to savior Im so proud
Jin finally adapted most of momy Juns Kazama-ryu moveset
1:07 Food Truck-san gonna beak ? 1:11 YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Add Ken Mishima as Jin Kazama's twin brother in Tekken 8. If this is not possible, please add Ken Mishima as a guest or DLC character. i request you I want to see Ken Mishima in Tekken 8.
Anyone here think TEKKEN should move to more lighter and faster combat? Cause they are fighting like anime crazy in the cinematics.
If they were to add an option for all characters to speak the same language like English, who would accept that specific voice setting if Jin got to be voiced by the guy behind the voice of DMC’s Nero and M vs C infinite’s zero?
If they were to add an option for all characters to speak the same language like English, please click the like icon if you agree with my idea on that specific voice setting if Jin got to be voiced by Yuri Lowenthal.
Jin has never been more awesome until this moment. I just wish his rage art was a bit.......more...Impactful??
When did Jin become the "One Winged Angel" lol😄
I thought there will be some graphical breakthrough. I can't find anything that has changed.
Really loved this series, but how is it different than what is was 10-15 years ago?
can't wait!!
I feel like he should be able to transform like how kazuya does in 7
Damn is devil jin even in the game cuz they really letting jin cook bro
"I wonder if you can hit people in this one?"  *is pleasantly surprised*
I hope they bring back the music playlist mixer that was in Tekken 7
Jin: Speaks Japanese. Me: ware waree waraaa.. lol
BRO WTF ALLREADY?!!!
very bad
Those special effects are too distracting they need to dial it back about 50%
It's out
Jin went from anti - villian in Tekken 6 to returned hero in Tekken 8!!
Where my shun masatsu???
"Strength isn't everything."  Proceeds to blow you up with a punch.
TEKKEN 8 looks so veautiful 🤩 Can't wait to get back in TEKKEN
"I shall not waver again." Jin is sounding like Soul Calibur 3 Siegfried: "Never again will I bend to anyone's will."  Love it!
I worry for Jin's health... it seems like his neck thickness doubles every game! 🤣  Nasty "muscle" design aside, Jin's gameplay looks amazing in Tekken 8. I might pick him up!
Ngl even though I’ll miss Jin’s voice that he’s had for the past like 20 years, it’s nice to see that their voices are getting updates too 👍
Anybody know when tekken 8 supposedly  drops?
So freaking hype for Tekken 8 this was amazing
Soul calibur??
Ready to see what Yoshimisu looks like. Hopefully he is done chasing school girls.
이야~
Thanks God the Jin redemption has begun because they’ve been doing him dirty for so long and he’s been lost as a character. Now time for him and Xiaoyu to finally realize their love for one another lol
unfortunately after they turned the game into infinite combos that can't be defended, I lost a little interest in the game, but it's still my favorite
Did he just say "doria"? He's doing flying kicks like Kazuya or is ir just me? Don't get me wrong this looks insane! I played T7 and I didn't like it, this looks a lot better
i just realized this is for next gen consoles only 😢
Sweet lord! I barely touch Jin, but some of this stuff looks absolutely sick and makes me want to play him more!
Man, they gotta fix that floor bounce
There is ONLY 1 Jin. And its Jin Sakai from Ghost of Tsushima
Lili.....? Lili when, anyone!!!???
So you lied in the first announcement trailer then. Cause this isn't what we saw that day
This version of jin is like mixing kazuha, devil jin and jin alltogether
Me : "Hey Jin, people seem to hate the idea that you are the lead character in T8..." Jin :  "And?" Me: "And how do you feel about that?" Jin: "They can kiss my asian/demon-infused ass.   Thats how I feel about it.."
On one hand this looks so dope, but I still can't help but be a little down that Devil Jin probably won't be a separate character.
I noticed some of his moveset somehow imitates Lars'. That's a nice touch
Too many damn sparkles.....
This would make a fantastic conclusion to the kazuya-jin rivalry.
Strength isn't everything. Aka being a weak bitch is the modern soyboy anthem
"Strength isn't everything." Why the shift in tone?
I love that Present Mike is the announcer for this one.
I wonder if this means there will be no devil Jin in tekken 8
SuperJuggles aren't fun. For the juggler,or the juggled,I'd much rather "fight" in my fighting game.I like a good chess match...... with more than one move. Also hopefully they bring back tag ,stop taking away characters and customizable options, remove all the added lag that wasn't needed in the previous games, stop becoming like street fighter, and remove cutscene rage moves ...... . ...
No hotdog food truck vender or bottle of ketchup or mustard was harmed in this video. lol
I hope they show how he gets to "Strenght isn't everything" instead of skipping the character development.
Hoping this will crush capcom's SF6 woke garbage. Looks good so far
Devil Jin no more?
Do I detect a little bit of Lars in his new moveset?
Like it looks cool as hell but part of me really appreciates the more realistic take on Karate the Kazama style has. Does he really need flip kicks that go 15 feet in the air? It is a little much and looks ridiculous compared to his more traditional katas.
Tekken 7  Jin:power is everything  Tekken 8 Jin:power isn't everything
Strength isn't everything, but turns into a Demon...?
I could destroy with Jin in Tekken Tag. Always loved him. I have no idea why they haven't made the greatest mobile game from Tekken.
Those hot dogs are now well done!
1:22 Jin finally has his own "Dorya!"
God damn, Jin looks sharp as hell in that new costume. I used to really favor his white flame Karate gi pants he had in Tekken 5 but that jacket is just exquisitely badass.
Now add Kiryu Kazuma.
It just me, why he sound like dating someone
This new Jin mixed styles and use powers of Devil Jin, imagine if this guy use his form from Tekken:blood revenge for me is true devil Jin.
The announcer hype as hell lol.
I hate the announcer
Kazuya's rage drive was cooler to me.
Man that announcer is awful
when he said "strength isn't everything"  I felt that.
My man did the rising dragon uppercut so smooth
Started playing tekken back on tekken 2.. I'll prob be playing tekken til I'm 60 yrs old
He's alright, but this is certainly the best he's ever looked. The devil gene thing  is a little boring 😴
Simple yet badass. 🙌🙌
Looks like DVJ is a thing of the past, I’ll be maining Jin now since he’s all in one.
Kazuya learned some of Heihachi's moves, so Jin learned dad's move of using his Devil Form in his base form. Devil Jin and Jin are one and the same now.
This gets a solid meh out of 5.
The music is going to be sooooo good.
I love tekken, but the amount of visual effects confuses me. This isn’t mortal kombat or street fighter
I just realized the announcer is the same lady who used to announce fighters back in Pride FC
Nah
After seeing Kazuya's rage art, everyone else's looks lame by comparison. love the rest of Jin's moveset tho.
Has Jin been training with his uncle? Seeing a few things that remind me of Lars
booooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!! I hate you Jin!!!!!
Jin Kazama in his peak character development 🤌🏼
Jin using that Rock Howard Pose now
When does this game come out? Anyone know thanks.
When's the release date?
I wish they aged the characters like they did in the past
Jun Kazama please...
I like it 🔥🔥🔥
I wish the rage art looked like it packed more of a punch. It seemed like it went right through Kazuya. I wanna see fist to face cinematic scenes
As a kazzy player, that lil' Jin basterd is gonna get whats coming to him😆.
Hopefully tekken 8 will bring characters from mortal kombat and killer instinct
So is Jin and Devil Jin gonna stay two characters?  This trailer makes me think yes
Sick! 🔥 Hope you can pick his T4 hoodie in customisation too.
So we're just Call of Dutying Tekken now? zzzzzz
1:08 do you guys not see what he did!?
Worst Rage art.
Wait, does this mean that Devil Jin is a separate playable character, or is he going to be like kazuya where he's going to transform into his devil form.
Omg the hit effects are sooo dope looking!
I'm looking forward to seeing Yoshimitsu design on this one lol
Looks good. I was expecting more
Not playing this game. But looking forward to watch world tours.
Jin still has a long way to go in the rage art department against his father!
Looks great. Personally, I'd remove the summersault stuff and I also think the special effects on moves need to be dialed back (critique of T8 gameplay overall), it's distracting.  I'd save the special effect stuff for interactions on hit or counter hit, it gives more weight and impact to the moments in the fight without spoiling gameplay.
Meh, where is Nina?!
Jin having full control of the Devil Gene and incorperating it into his Karate is the hypest thing I have seen in all of Tekken. Ever.
Hope everybody got they PS5s for this
1:08 “So…you guys want a hot dog or what?”
Is that the pride lady?
Great now show me Bryan.
It's been 84 years
Masterful!
Do you guys think we are still getting Devil Jin?
I've chills and I love the use of explosive colors! <3
I just want Christie!!!!
Wack
I hope will see jun kazama, law, paul, lars, jack 8 & king gameplay trailer reveal in the next few weeks 😂
Weekly trailers until release is dope 🔥
This is now a 3D anime game. And I'm ALL about it!
Beautiful! Please put John Wick in the roster!!!!
Our boy has grown
pov: you get your ass handed to you but it's beautiful
There is no powerful effect.. This trailer also is Disappointing
Jin using Devil Gene as a tool or weapon instead of a curse! Jin was always fascinating and a dark hero,,,,,,,………,,,..,..,,,
Ohk now, time to make jin as main, lets see what lars brings now
So sad the world has to settle for this chintzy combat system.  Tekken is a flickering, gaudy Las Vegas neon sign.  Virtua Fighter is a hand-crafted teak signpost, pointing to a humble master.  We get what we deserve, I guess.
bring christie monteiro back 😭😭😭
🔥
Some of Jin's moves in this trailer are from his mother Jun's fighting style. Looks like he's using it again and incorporated it with Traditional Karate. Shades of Tekken 3 when he was using it with Mishima Karate. 👍
So they combined Jin and Devil jin into one character
Downgrade
Finally...we get True Jin! I'm loving this new version of himself.
Literally the last game. No innovation at all. Nothing in the 3d fighting genre will change until Virtua Fighter 6 drop.
I've been waiting for this since the last trailer featuring Kazuya. Thanks 😉
Just hope the load times is way better on here than it is on 7
That super can be better
I’m so hyped, when is it coming out ?
Wow i can't believe They made Jin fat now.
This is fucking amazing!!!I really like how he has merged with devil jin completely
Jin & Sephiroth related for sure.
my man has finally become a hero once again.
The announcer sounds like Lenne Hardt.
Jin brought the one winged angel to Tekken just now
Same game lmao
Interesting moveset, I saw some Mishima, Shaheen and Dragunov moves there...I wonder if there's a story to that.
as a jin kazama hater, now i like him.   edit : jin has his own omen without even using his devil form, that's tough.
The ONLY way someone doesn't win a tournament with this character now,is if the DLC is cheap and OP again💯
SF x Tekken version of Jin
Jin looks sick, kinda hate the announcer though.
Kinda looks like tekken 7. And tekken 7 kind of looked like tekken 6.
RIDGE RACER V PlayStation 5 XBOX  Games we I want to remarry a car racing Erasure
No lie this is amazing finally after all these years
Mk 12 will is going to mop this and street fighter, they are to far behind to compete.
How many effects do you want?   Yes.
the most over played over hyped character in tekken history lol
Man, this game is causing more hype with each trailer they put out! As a Jin main, I can't wait to play Jin in Tekken 8!I'll also play Kazuya too. I've been looking forward to this game for years, and it's finally happening! Also can't wait to see Kazuya and Jin duke it out and put an end to their epic rivalry. Hail to The King Of Iron Fist! ✊
Jin looks dope....but the real main 2 questions is: where is Asuka and Howrang 🤷🏿
Ryu has finally conquered the satsui no hadou and mastered the power of nothingess.  Jin has finally tamed the devil within him and no longer succumbs to his influence. He even recognizes that power is not the answer to everything.   Our boys have come a long way 😭😭
bright color & particle effect tekken 7??
Ki T Ra
I've mained jin since tekken 3. And this might be an unpopular opinion but I hate the changes.
I hate fighting games but this man seems cool so I might play.
okay. I say this from the heart: I HATE THIS ANNOUNCER!!! he keeps bringing trailers from 10/10 to  9/10.
As a Jin main, I'm creaming rn 💀
I was hoping there would not be Rage arts anynore in 8 :( how disappointing. They almost turned this game into typical anime fighter like e.x. Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm...
So we have anti button mashing mechanics now? And it looks like rage is still in?
"I Shall Not Waver Again" 🥲
2024!
Graphics, Effects looks fine now. Can I get expectation next will be announcer?
WAT  IS HAPPENING
“Sorry to keep you waiting” chills 🥶  I can’t wait 🤪
Is this Tekken or soul calibur go back to Tekken 3 game play
Repent from your sins 🙏and turn to God ✝️for the kingdom of heaven is at hand ❤️
Yooo, this is giving me Rock Howard vibes and making me wanna main Jin.
🥱Yawn. Looks like the last 4 or 5 Tekkens. It's quite depressing at this point
He's like a one wing angel
You can omen into as a extender?! Are you serious!?
Why does he have toilet paper attached to his pants? 💀💀
Kiryu and baki need to be in this game
Jin went from just being angy and brooding to feeling like an anime protagonist, love it
Tekken 8 is finnna go crazzzzyyyyy
This is so good, Tekken is my favorite fighting game
That beat goes hard .✊🏻🔥
this is awesome
Tekken 8 looking better than sf6
Is it just me, or is there some Rock Howard to some of the silhouettes?  Hoo boy, wonder about the main roster.... and are we going to eventually see more crossovers folded into canon like gouki??
...... "Strength isn't everything" but you're using it to beat the fk out your dad????? -1 like for attempting to gaslight us in its *PUREST FORM*
1:02
🔥🔥🔥
is it just me or does his awesome movepool now resemble Lars a bit too? I really like that addition
Does this means that Devil Jin won't be a playable character like Devil Kazuya?
No one talking about how they are FUCKING UP that food truck lmao
Rock Howard is that you?
some simp who never left the village: "he looks different somehow🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔"
Dopest Monsta Jin I've ever seen in my entire fxking life
Is it just me or does anyone else hate the announcer’s voice?
flip kick bound/screw thing looks weird to me
Naturally
Harada implanted Jenova cells into Jin.
The minds behind the "Mishima greeting" need more credit for creating something so iconic.
I don't think I'll get used to this announcer.
Yo that kick across the map was disrespectful as hell lmao
No B1? Damn. Love the D1 armor move though.
Way too much effects... That sparkling thing ... I thought that's Tekken not Techno ( rave or club with visuals 🙃 ).
Yeah that's definitely Tekken.
Jin kazama is my favorite fighter in tekken games
Jin kazama has return to tekken 8 and he is cool
🥱so far looks boring man's super is just 1 punch 😂 yea... Good job Harada
Do we call Jin the "One Winged Angel" as well?
Damn, them some daddy issues
Steve Fox reveal soon I hope
That hotdog stand is OP
something about tekken 8 reminds me of marvel vs capcom 3, i think it's the bright colors and the music
Awesome....
CHIKARAAAAAAA
What the hell is this song? I need this in my life.
Can't wait for Eddy 😋😋
Cool that Jin is finally controlling the devil power, and by the looks of it, the combo system has been tweaked.. but eh.
I could never get into tekken 🤷‍♂️
Too many effects. You can't even see the moves. 😮‍💨
I can't wait to watch pro comps. I never played Tekken a whole lot but it's so entertaining to watch.
I'm excited. Can't wait to see the full character list.
This looks like every other tekken released lol
I do not like that voices!
So I assume Devil Jin is no longer a separate character? Cool.
That win pose is quite similar to Jin Kisaragi and Rock Howard
My favorite fighting game ever 🔥🔥🔥💪
Not as cool as the Kazuya reveal and still getting used to some of those new aerial moves but still good
With all these Devils running around, I wouldn’t be surprised if Asta come running out there with that sword yelling for nothing🤣🤣🤣
That hotdog stand was really taking it for the team.
The GOAT is here ....
remove the super combo bullshit already
This new announcer is such a cringe...
SICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My boi is going to kick so much ass and his personality is finally back for so long i was getting worried.
As a Jin Main... I approve this T8 Jin! I'm hyped for this!
Christie?
Tekken8  meet Asian people
Pq os jogos de hj em dia tem  essa necessidade imensa de colocar tudo colorido? cheio de efeito e os caraio? Acho isso ridículo, mas não deixarei de apreciar esse jogo,dessa franquia que eu amo.
That looks really really boring. Do all the sparks and fire cover up the fact that it's just kicks and punches?
Dope
Jin got flash kick. Hype
Not only my Boi is back to his normal self but he seems to borrow Solid Snakes catch phrase, In all seriousness im really excited about this game. So far they had not spoil the plot, unlike Tekken 7, so far which is good and shown enough of what the story is about and not only that they truly build the game from the ground up new poses, new moves, new rage art, etc. If they keep this up with the promoting of the game and if turns out successful this might be the greatest Tekken game we had in a long time.
Great, now he knows GENOCIDE CUTTAH
Only trailer I care is the one that reveal the release date.
What happened to the beautiful graphics on the 1st trailer? Never trust the 1st one.
"Lars mains patiently waiting for lars gameplay trailer"
Unbound Jin is more stylish than that.  Unbound Jin is the perfect prototype that combines Kazama and Mishima Karate style. Unbound Jin inherits from the whole family's techniques, from Mishima Jinpachi, to even Lars and Heihachi mishima.  Unbound Jin is ultimate power.
진 존나 기대했는데 뭔가 뭔가 모시꺵이 하게 밋밋하네
ps4 dead?
Jim is my favourite character in the tekken series. I'm buzzing with this intro and the merging of the devil into the style. Reminds me of Ryu's journey. Also loving "I shall never waver again" line. Epic.
Jin jacket is dripped in lit 🔥
This new Tekken is too flashy for me
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. There is no Devil Jin? I guess?
fuckin hype...but what is this announcer? they need the one from 4 back
Where are the girls at
O Jim é muito maneiro !!
1:10 Considering that even a building is crumbling when they fight.. That's one tough hot dog stand.
From: "Power is Everything."  To: "Strength isn't Everything."  Jin having a combined moveset of himself and Devil Jin is honestly THE best thing for him!! He looks sick as hell!!
i really didn’t think they were gonna give us a trailer for him but i’m so glad he does
LETS GO JIN BRO THIS TRAILER LOOKS AWESOME
Wait what, at 0:44 Jin has flying kick like Akuma now?
Tekken and Street Fighter def releasing the same month.
ARSENALTY GONNA BE HAPPYY
Bro some people complain about the partical effects being too much but I think they look fire
I thought I was seeing things when I seen TEKKEN on my tablet!!!!  This is amazing!!
Looks like fighterz now wtf
Can’t lie , i love tekken have been a fan for a long time since childhood , but this game so far looks like and has a feel like it’s more king of fighters rather than traditional tekken , the announcer is also annoying that voice HAS to change , I just want tekken 5 back man 🤣😭 they’re trying way too hard on this one , so many looks have changed up for legacy characters , the moves look crazy also , not sure if it’s a good thing or bad thing
CYBER TEKKEN, 2 MUCH EFFECTS
そう！これだよ！ この非情に徹してようとしてなりきれない仁がいいんだよ！ 今まで使い回しだったボイスも装い新たに、ようやく俺たちの仁が帰ってきた！！
Jin literally devoured Devil Jin that's why he looks more jacked now lol.
YES!
with this trailer, i hope they're going to keep the pace of releasing character trailers every 7 days. fkin hypedddd
Smart to hype up the game , by showing us specific character trailers from time to time.
He’s arrived😈
TAPOOOOOOOOORRRRA MENOOOORRRRR
Is this street fighter or tekken?
Looks fantastic!  We also need ridge racer 8!   Soul calibur 7!   And soul calibur collection sc1-5!
Wish Manny Pacquiao is in the game
1:22 DORYA (HE SAID IT! I hope that's not a mistake... Maybe Omen stance will make a return?)
thats the sturdiest hotdog stand in the world
I guess Tekken 8 released from year of 2023 to year of 2024.
CHESTO!!!!
GET ME OUT OF A DOUBT IS THERE DOWN GRADE??
GET ME OUT OF A DOUBT IS THERE DOWN GRADE??
Jin looks like that ohio final boss
Excelsior!!!!!
I love what they did with his moveset!😲
1:09 Hot dog guy is standing there and shaking his head like a final boss.
Good lawd! I'll be all over Tekken 8 fosho lol 👍🏼
Would be cool if you could select like your prefered "rage-art-finisher", and if there was like a set of 10 for each character.  That would be fresh af.
He does Law Somersaults now...  Also, seems like he regrets his actions from Tekken 6.
2023 is a Fighting game year. Can't wait for this.
Jun please
I guess the fire on one of his legs are gone since i suppose jun is there or what?
Jun Kazama trailer next please!!!!
Danm what a terrible song, annoying.
if Jun wasn't the next character reveal, then she won't be a playable this time again.
Jin super is Hella wack!!
The fact that Jin said strength isn't everything anymore means my boi is back in his Tekken 3 - 4 state now. He's a good guy now 😃.
Man I can't wait to see Yoshimitsu
I mean soon or later he gotta take control of his devil gene
He's Jin and Devil Jin at the same danm time!
Jin has evolved so much that he gained Rock Howard's victory pose.
Now that Heihachi is out of the picture we can finally see the final battle between Jin and Kazuya. And this time Jin is actually a good guy again, thankfully. He's got complete control of the devil gene and the way it has been incorporated into his karate is dope af. My first glance of his one wing definitely felt like a ripoff of Sephiroth, but I can forgive Namco for it because his design, look, etc is perfect...
"Strength isn't everything" meanwhile jin looks fucking cracked, love it.
DJ with tattoo, horns, chains and black wings is cooler.
I like Kazuyas trailer more.
This game is still great, and I can’t wait to play. My only nitpick about it is all the flashiness and supers. Like I’m i playing dbz, street fighter, marvel vs capcom, or Tekken? I don’t know.. just seems a little distracting, and could be left out without effecting the gameplay.
Man this game looks amazing
I think Rock Howard at the very end lol
Boring. Its like tk7.5
I WANT TO PLAY THIS RIGHT NOW!
broooo I got fucking GOOSE BUMPS
0:51 um character development I guess? I just hope they don't act like Jin didn't commit massive genocide as if Tekken 6 never happened but rather Jin accepts what he has done and atone for his sins
1:08 THE OMEN STANCE RETURNSSSS
jin start moving like lars
OH MY GOD, this is what I’ve been waiting for, Jin gameplay babeeeeey, all his moves looks so sick, and that super is so freaking cool…I am so HYPED to play as Jin Kazama, he’s my dude!!!!!😁
Hwoarang plz.
Need to put a trailer of character roster! Hopefully Bruce makes a comeback!!
the hotdog guy would be me
Idk if it’s just me being biased but kazuyas moves looks 10x better than this imo
Is baki trailer coming to?
Solid outfit for sure, the facial work in this one is fucking insane.  Edit - I guess Jin is Sephiroth and Kenny Omega now too. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Man, that hotdog stall must be the strongest infrastructure in Tekken.
please make for Bryan Fury or Steve Fox also. Thank youuu!
I remember they used to make these character videos when Tekken 6 came out. Memories
this isnt |JIn anymore he's "GigaJin Chadzama" XD
Game looks great still not really feeling the announcer but it’s fine
He got the omen uppercut 👀👀👀
Wow 😍
Dam this game be looking goood that was a sick trailer
Jin:  -Strength isn't everything... Dude in a van at 1:09: - Guess i'll die.
All nice and cool but... WE WANT TTT3 !!!!!!
This guy ran with main protagonist syndrome winning 4 straight games and had an edgier boy phase where he started the current world wars.   I hope his dad kick his ass and the final bout is Jun vs Kazuya.
Our new Champ!  Now we only need to buff Lars!
Our new Champ!  Now we only need to buff Lars!
From   Power is everything  To Strength isn't everything   Character development right here
Baki Hanma Wheree?
Naturally, tekken is about smart combat and different styles, and not a lot of bright thoughts, flashes of special effects and other tinsel. so far it's just a disappointment.
Hell yeah Jin go get him!
She's what a bad ass
Having Jin in the good guys team and in control of himself again is a great oportunity to use his original theme! Return his Tekken 3 music! Or remix it. It is one of the greatest in the entire series!
Oh Max is gonna be so happy he can use Jin again.  He was gonna play Lars, but if Jin has enough of Lars movelist maybe he can stick to those while relearning Jin now...
Any one else trip off how he has his demon voice mixed in to his actions sounds now? I'm hearing some tekken three Jin in there. "Oraaa! Ehint!" Like he sounds like he in full Jin mode! 🤣 I'm just being silly but still can't wait!
Y'all excited for Ling Xiaoyu's reveal 😭😭😭
Is this the complete Jin version?  Karate with T3 Mishima Jin moves and Devil Jin moves?  Please be it.
The strength isn’t everything definitely from his mother
Announcer is garbage.
Is play style reminds me a lot of Lars.
I’m I wrong for saying I was expecting a little more
No way my potato gonna run this tho
Lars next week…. Hopefully hes just as amazing as his brother and nefew
oh gosh. this is the 2nd best thing.
1:08 Did they really give my man the Omen thunder God fist??
Jin's super: "Big punch uwu". Kazuya's super: "OUDDA MY WAY, I'MMA BLOW THIS MF UP."
I can't wait for the tournament of 8
Yup. I'm playing this guy. No more cringe "Power is everything", now the little boy Jin have become a man.
it's nice to see your main represented, even though he's the poster child.
That's the announcer from Pride fighting championships, right?
The arena looks amazing
Jin had the sickest combos in tekken 7 dude I love playing jin
broooo the growth!!!  we went from 力くそすべてだ   to  力だけすべてじゃない  This is the Jin, I was cheering for at the end of Tekken 4 and 5 as a kid who understood his journey.  I was so heartbroken to see him become the very same people he swore to stop. Tekken 6, he was Obsessed with power and overall became unrecognizable for me.
So will Jin and Devil Jin be one character now?
I’m gonna call Parents Protective Services to report this father abuse
Jin going Sephiroth
Jin: "you knew this day was coming, father!!!" Kazuya: "of course, Jin. I've waited for this. Ready to die?" Jin: "No, I'm here to end this!!!
As a Jin main, this is the BEST version of Jin I've seen. From Mishima style to Kazama/Mishima Hybrid Style, Devil Jin, Omen stance in Tag. It's is now a mixture of all these styles in one! I'm so hype to learn his new movelist!!
Jin and Kazuya both have immaculate drip in Tekken 8
LOL he's a Kof character now
“The new One Winged Angel “Jin Kazama
Well I know who I’m going Main in The Next Tekken guys
Jin's juggling is a bit sluggish here. But let's see other players can tinker Jin's juggling around.   PS: I don't play Jin that much, because I'm a Steve Fox user.
He still a full on terrorists lol. But this might redeem Jin
Great. Looks like he inherited Heihachi's leg strike.  That's not going to be abused...
hope i can turn down all the pretty sparks.
This Jin fights like Lars. I’m going back to Kazuya
This one didn't hit right.
One-Winged Devil?
Why does he fight like Lars?
Amazing
I just hope that's not the official announcer of Tekken 8
I liked his switch to more standard karate since T4, this is quite a bit more anime than that.
I cannot wait for Tekken 8!! It has been a long time waiting, but so worth it <3 Best fighting games ever made
My Guy
Ma boy is here.😂
Strength isn't everything..
game isn't coming out this year guys. this is the year of SF 6
@Devilister he finna go ham on this
Screaminggggg😭💖
Father vs son
WE WANT THE KING SHOWCASE ! <3
TONE DOWN THE EFFECTS!!!!!
Present 6 hours
Fighting with him looks super satisfying. His  heat move is pretty ass though.
Looks more like street fighter than Tekken, not to mention how annoying announcer sounds like.
Ok Capcom, if you want him to be my main so badly then I'll take it.
Why does tekken 8 look more like a streetfighter ? That’s not what I expect …
took much sparkly garbage going on.
From "power is everything" to "strength isn't everything", Jin's finally back on the good side.
Where is bryan fury
Kazuya uses his human martial arts as a front to hide his demon power.  Jin uses the demon power in service of his human martial arts.  Yeah, this is awesome. I'm glad Jin is returning to his hero days. As a fan of him ever since Dark Resurrection, it was cool to see him rise to the head of the Zaibatsu in his ending, but when 6 rolled around and he was a douche, I was so sad.
I hope Jun's trailer is next, all of this is looking good.
Super move was whack
welp...thats it i guess...RIP  devill Jin  2005-2015 your  sexy  laugh will be  remembered...
As a Jin main since his release, this is what I've been wanting!! A mixture of both his normal and devil fighting styles. I'm sold!
Announcer sounds like the Pride lady! First thought I had!
actually looks incredible!!! good job Bandai Namco. Looks better than the last 4 tekkens, love the blood cloud effects
Where's the corkscrew?
Gives me Kyo Kusanagi vibes.
I haven't seen Jin do That Mishima uppercut 1:09 since Tekken 3. I might have to pick up Jin again for T8 and main him like in T7
He Went from “Power is Everything” to “Strength isn’t Everything” 👏
The real OP character is the hotdog seller at 1:10 being completely unphased while the hotdog truck is violently rattling
Underwhelming.
.......wow. just wow. This is amazing. Jin looks incredibly fun to use now and can combot whatever bs going to be in this game lol
I love the impact from every burst attack it looks and sounds good
GOOD GUY JIN IS BACK!
He is sexy,but i never liked his movelist,is so basic
Tbh i was kinda meh on the sephiroth wing, but seeing it appear during so many of his attacks it gives me Rock Howard vibes, i kinda dig it now lol
1:33 One wing Devil 😈  Sephiroth: yoooooooo this man spitting
Bro giving me rock howard vibes.....lel get it?
Somthing tells me tekken 8 will just be a repeat of son killing father 😂 😊
I just noticed that he "doryah" kazuya at the beginning of his Rage art . 😂 He looks awsome btw but man i'am a kazuya main. 😎
Where in the motherfuck is Siabol Jin ?
Damn I want this stage music ASAP
"Chin Kazama" lol
I swear, every character in this game just became Lars in gameplay. And I'm all for it
Nahhh, ima just play stf
I just realized something. Everyone seems to be getting flashier movesets in this game, be it weapons or special powers, which could make it easier to adapt them in a 2D game. SFxT2 would be cool af
Can we have baki hanma, hippo makunouchi, yujiro hanma or mr unchained?
After watching this, Rock Howard leans back, folds his arms, and gives a Geese Howard smile.
If we get a character Trailer once a week, that's awesome
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!
Damn I wasn’t exactly sold on the game just yet but seeing Jin definitely makes we want to play him. Like goddamn he looks so cool and the character development my god
Jin going One Winged Angel
First thing I'm making my homie jin hoodie just like Tekken 4 and bearded 👍🏾😁👍🏾
No... They added some bullshit pirate karate moves...
Jin going all Sephiroth on bitches.
I have to say, an amazing reveal no doubt, but Kazuya´s fucking hell.. another level to me.
I'm proud
As a Jin main, can't wait! I'm not really competitive, but imma start trying out this next game tbh
Jin went from Tragic Hero to THE MAIN DUDE
YO WHAT THE HELL  HE'S GETTING EVEN FLASHIER THAN LARS  Time to learn Jin now.
My boi Jin control the devil Jin now?
R.I.P. Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, etc…
Waiting for lee
Wait, so that means no more DVJ as a separate char?Oooooh
"Strength isn't everything." Some of the newer players won't understand how powerful this line is. After hearing the complete opposite for years it's cool seeing some character development. Especially in his game play controlling the devil gene.
Damn rip devil Jin players lol
My main man Jin is looking 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Меня глаза не обманывают ???? 1:10 апперкот в стиле мишимы?!?! Блин да он просто имба, как хочется уже в это поиграть …
It's one of the famous characters Jin I like in Tekken I like ham but my mom like somebody else that is Paul🙂🙂🙂🎆🎇✨️🎆✨️🎇
Boring 🥱 I want Jun
Enough of jin, show me steve
Jun would be proud.
Game looks dope, gonna wait 3 years later and grab the complete/goty version for reasons
kazama jin
So, JIn not only is a Karate practitioner, but is also incorporating moves from his Devil form (which is already combination of Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima, and extenension of the Devil/Angel moves like the lasers and stuff) HES PRACTICING 4 STYLES AT ONCE WTF lol
Too noisy. Too overloaded... This is not Karate's spirit. In Tekken 3, Jin had a real personnality. Clean, calm and powerful. Real Atmosphere. I am disapointed, sorry.
My guy be using mishima and krate and kazama style nice with a little devil power
써머솔트는 솔직히 로우가 가져가야지...
Unbound Jin is REAL!!!!
Tekken got the Pride annoucer am i dreaming
Amazing! Love the Jin & DJin fusion moveset. I need to see his full move list to see what got replaced. I hope he gets DJin's "Three Ring Circus" string. Also, (For reference: Any move with the 3 red claw marks/wings are DJin moves) Can't wait to play this 😁
Runitblack SUCK ASS :P HAHAHA Jin Kazama: I now have Lars' low punch move & Akuma's jumping dive kick 😁
😮
The poor guy in the hot dog stand is so frozen in fear, his model bugged out and doesnt even move when the stand itself looks like it's about to explode.
I don’t like the finisher it was sorta weak
Its refreshing to hear Jin having new grunt sounds 😆is it the same voice actor too?
I've seen this trailer like 5 times already annnnnnnnd this looks like normal Jin with some flashy lights....it's kind bland compared to Kazuya
Ok ok this is so fking cool omg but kind of messy tho
никакого развития, одна и так же хрень каждый новый теккен..
ffs fix this announcer it break the immersion already at the beginning
So... now he is a one winged angel... okay there Sephiroth.
UE ruins another game.
Graphics are neat, but there's something about Tekken's animations/physics that just drain the hype for me..  I feel like Tekken 3 hit the summit and they just plateaued ever since.. :/
His super needs a little polishing maybe more red filter
My boy looks amazinggggggg!
Pretty weak graphics, again. Almost every next gen game has better models, better textures and hi-poly assets. Just compare this fighting game with only two main charachters in a small arena to the open world of the Horizon Forbidden west for example. Night and day difference.  And those huge explosive effects everywhere? Jesus^^.... I miss good old tekken (3).
is this implying that devil jin will not be a character this time?
If Jin can control his devil genes, will that remove devil jin as a separate character?
MY FAVORITE CHARACTER SINCE TEKKEN 3!!!!!!
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING.  Also Jin fists you out of existence.
So does this mean Devil Jin won't be his own character? 😞😓
The first Jin vs Kazuya trailer looked Awesome !!! But this ?... it makes my eye hurt to look at it ! All that fancy pointless colorful explosions. I can't even see what they even doing 😮‍💨
"Strength isn't everything" IT'S HERE EVERYBODY! JINS REDEMPTION ARC!
Damn Jin if fucking BADASS than ever!🤩
Really Love everything but his ult at the end is kinda lackluster tho ngl. Should end with a bang
This has to be the best I’ve seen Jin in such a long time. Since the changes of tekken 5, Jin hasn’t changed as much, but this trailer breathes new life into the character dynamic and the voice lines portray a new outlook and change within Jin’s demeanor. It’s just a beautiful thing as well to see Jin regain Omen stance and to see OTGF is such a heart warming sight…
I love that Times Square stage.  Gives me Tekken 4 Shinjuku vibes.
Baki va estar en tekken 8  xD?
1:18 that kick
1:08 OMEN IS BACK
What a colorful game. I can't say I like it.
Jins Therya! ?
Bryan fury next please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
He looks even stronger than in Tekken 7, looks like some old moves got changed and now do new stuff he couldn't do before, and he got new moves to replace the old moves that don't work the same now, looks hype
Pathetic. Please dont continue development anymore. It will be a failure
Your not a real tekken player if your not a Jin Player!
just wow!
karate + devil jin style + mishima martial art and my boy said "power is not everything"? well, what a good time to be alive, more than 20 years waiting for this damn moment and I'm happy.  PD: and the best of all is that they fixed his face compared to the debut of the trailer
The worker standing perfectly in the food truck looks funny as hell
Street fighter 6 , tekken 8,final fantasy 16 man 2023 is going to be a good year for gaming
My husband<3 I was sooo excited and anxious for his gameplay
Give us Jun Kazama traler
Give me the god that is Bryan muhahaha!
Is it just me, or did we just see Jin using some of Lars' moves?
Jin has evolved so much. Can’t wait for Thai game. They always have the best music also
I'm seriously glad Jin has matured inot his power and into his personality, in particular. Man, I _CANNOT_ wait for Jun!
I hope that not only Jin Kazama goto so many new moves, I hope that all other characters will get the same benefit.
Sorry....Bandai. Very Bad Timing. A little known fighting game begins with S is coming out soon...
This game has turned into King of fighters
Remember Jun's Words. "Have you forgotten my teachings?"
I may be Team Kazuya but it feels good to see Jin come this far.
The character development is crazy  Also they gave him a fucking dive kick what the hell that’s awesome !!! Sad for Eliza though
soo....they changed the Seiyuu of Jin at this point? or am I hearing things wrong?
Been using Jin since Tekken 3... can't tell or explain how I'm feeling after this trailer, man, I just can't wait to master this new moves set and combos... I think we're going to see the ultimate version of this man...! Watching him use some Mishima Style moves combined with his Kyokushin style it's everything I wanted to see all these years!  Add: I think he learned some moves from Lars too 👀
The genocidal war monger returns
Gonna miss T7 DJin 💪😪
Here’s what I LOVE about the FGC… they all borrow from eachother in different ways… If I didn’t know any better, you could have told me this was a NEW Street Fighter the way Jin was moving… Especially that downward Akuma kick he did, and the rest of his moves that look like Ryu. Bottom line, I’m excited AF for Tekken 8, SF6 and whatever else is in the pipeline… The next few years are gonna be CRAZY for the FGC
Can we stagger these with character reveals? Kinda sucks getting nothing new aside a more in-depth look at a moveset on someone we know is in and that we already knew the new gimmick on. Trailer looked great, but Kazuya and Jin back to back is a bit much.
The announcer is annoying
Can imagine what's not safe to how to punish his flashy moves now. But wow jin's trailer relatively close from kazuya's nice *i want bob, leo and the space ninja tho* also lars trailer surely is next.
JIn looks REALLY REALLY GOOD!
Im actually getting hpyed for this game.
Tienen que traer todo el vestuario de todos los tekken y que no sean de pago
1:07 the strongest hot dog salesman ever. Kazuya is getting slammed into it and the hot dog guy is unfazed.   He built different
so he can"t transform like kazuya during heat mode it means devil jin will arrive soon that sounds DOPE !
JINS GOT THE DORYAAAAAS NO LONGER THE SCHROEDINGERS 'MISHIMA HE IS THE REAL DEAL
1:09 so… power stance will now be actually useful? 🤔
Nice graphics but the light show is not visually appealing
The One Winged Devil
Tekken 6 : power is everything Tekken 8 : power isn't everything
Everything looks good, but that rage art is pretty lame.
Tekken 4 Jin: I will abandon the Mishima style and suppress my devil gene.   Tekken 8 Jin: On second thought, they look cool af tho
Tekkan 8 soundtrack sounds soooo good!
They made him Rock Howard, what the hell?
Why does the new announcer sound like the same gal from Rumble Roses XX?
wow nice tekken 7 dlc its not? well it does look like it
He reminds me of Guts who had learned to use the powers of the Berserker armor without letting the armor taking full control of him. He's like a martial arts Guts who just got out of the black swordsman arc😅
Please where is yoshimitsu???
Im still torn about the amount of special effects. Part of me wants classic clean look of Tekken, but part of me (the part that loves games like MvC ) likes the flash.
ALSO WHERE IS THE DAH :(
Give me tk3 moveset Jin  Three ring where you@👀 JIn=Hard🔥
Wait  So we won't have devil jin as a separate character? :(
Release Paul's gameplay please
The jacket has a hood! We need the hood to be functional! Hood Jin has been a staple since his rework in T4 (sans T6).
Jin Kazama is incredible! His design: 9.5/10. His moveset: 10/10. His overall character: 8/10. Jin is the epitome of badass. I'm maining him DAY 1.
It's crazy, you can't see the darkness no more.  Speaking of darkness, can we get regular Raven? And master raven as it's own character name seraph? Just asking for myself.
Lenne Hart as the new announcer?  I'm in!  ZEEEEENKAIGER!
I've been wanting Devil Jin and Jin to become one character for over 10 years now and I can finally have peace       RIP Devil Jin you will be missed🙏
Next up gotta be Jun Kazama!! Wanna bet???!
Jin has mastered control of the demon, looks awesome
Залетайте на мой канал там тоже много видео будет про теккен 8
Hehe can anyone sense the DMC5 Nero influence? I love the direction they’re taking Jin, hope his classic costume is available tho lol.
Not them stealing Rock Howard outro
Oh this boy is a grown ass Man now!
These last two reveals (Kazuya and Jin) were kinda lazy. We already saw them a long time ago. Reveal some new (or returning) characters, especially females, please.
Jin aprendió las patadas aéreas de su tío lars xD
C’mon! Now give us Devil Jin!
Jin is a one winged ángel like sephiroth!!!
Oh my God, this makes me even more anxious and eager to see Jun. She’s gonna look so beautiful 😩
playing only by Jin since 1997
That somersault kick is so sick
1:05 A little glitch in graphics if you look closely...
Jun kazama next? 👀👀
Still waiting on tekken x sf 😂
I'm hoping for mardux's return
And what are these flips? What is he, Lars?! 😂😂
I wish they would do away with the opponent fall back animation when doing combos. I know it’s a Tekken thing but it’s old now
He looks so much lighter. Almost as if there’s a huge weight lifted off his shoulder. You can see it in his clothes too with the white colors mixed in with the black; basically saying that he has finally merged his two sides together into one.
This is awesome. But that kazuya trailer hit so much harder imo. Jin looks strong and it’s awesome but it’s cool seeing kazuya go full villain mode
SF6 will still dominate.
Idc about the characters that i know are in the game already. Show me the come back characters…
*MASTERPIECE*
Sooo....What we can side step now? or am I hallucinating here?
I always feel like in games, a characters move list should have the ultimate as the most hype move.  I just don't get that from this Jin. Tekken 7 Devil Jin yes, and this Kazuya, yes. But thia Jin's ultimate seems quite lack.luster all tjings considered, like a watered.down version of what Ryu does in Street fighter 6.
Anyone know where I can get the song
1:08 the person in a hotdog food stand are sooooooooo chilllll
HE ACTUALLY COMBINING BOTH OF HIS FIGHTING STYLES
Yeah you can definitely feel the newness going on with the moves being showcased. Great job, namco. Game is looking great.
Can we just agree the new announcer should be changed, the game is dope no cap but the announcer😕
Every punch sounds like a gunshot, I love it!
That’s noctis
Graphics is great but I still miss the style of Tekken 4 so much. I barely see actual moves because I am distracted by all the lightnigs on the screen. 🥲 It is more like goddamn disco than “Iron Fist Tournament”. In Tekken 10 we will get only flashy screen without any actual characters seen. C’mon! 🙏
glad jin looks like tekken 4 again  just glad jin isnt super slow like tekken 5 and 6 and is now back as a quick charater
Similarly to Kazuya and Paul, Jin also seems less gimmicky which is great, I'm looking forward to play as him in this one, especially seeing as he as inherited some Devil Jin stuff.
Announcer is HORRIBLE!!!!
I actually thought we'd have to wait longer to get another character trailer. But i guess since jin is one of the characters we saw since namco started showing gameplay, it makes sense a trailer for him wouldn't take long to make. Same for paul, law, jack and lars, i'm assuming.
I am really impressed Namco has remained consistent in music quality throughout all of Tekken’s history. Whatever track was used in this trailer is a banger.
O jogo tá muito bom, mais esse dublador tá horrível, espero que tenha opção de mudar o locutor, tá feio esse cara falando....
I think next trailer will might be of jun kazama.
Every character they have shown so far has a more defined and refined toolkit than Tekken 7. This game is gonna be amazing. Jin main forever baby.
This much closer to a Hwoarang reveal
So my mans got flash kicks now?🤣
I want Kiryu in the game plzzz
at first, i was a bit iffy on the black and white outfit. then it hit me that Jin's rocking his mother's colors.
🔥🔥
I love how they seem to be showing trailers for all the characters. I hope they continue to do more.
NOOOOO. They took away my boy devil Jin 😭😭😭😭!!!!!!!!
Didnt slap as hard as Kaz trailer but still good🔥🔥🔥
god damn. this looks like the most fun-to-play jin yet. i hope they have old style story mode though. i hated tekken 7 story mode. and the arcade mode, u get to play only 5 matches or something on arcade. really kills the flow. + the long loading screens. oof.... tekken 7 was good only for multiplayer and it's graphics. :/ I hope they bring the old style back. tekken 5 era.
Okay, so he's got Lars' right hand low, his left punch is an armour move that also has an extension, he can fly in the air a lot more, he's got a new sidestep move (launcher?), new moves out of stances, and his rage art is now a mid. I definitely missed a few things, but that's still a lot being shown here.
Tevvez sound? BRA?
waiting for king
ol Rock Howard lookin ass I love it
I really like that Jin has total control over his devil gene which parallels Kazuya's being one with it. Character development right there.
You can barely see the movements because of too much flashy effects, this doesn't feel like a tekken anymore 🥲
Loveee it
Yessss
🗑️
They seem committed to upping the ante in terms of fictional assists; Nina has guns now as part of her normal moveset, Law nunchucks. It think they're worried Tekken looked tame compared to SF and MK?  I hope they don't lose the fact that lots of people enjoy Tekken for how well-animated it is, yes, haha, you can freeze frame and make Kazuya look silly during his hellsweep, hahahaha I'm so clever. But generally, Tekken has usually erred on the side of well paced, cool-looking body motion.  Everything I've seen of Tekken 8 so far has been speed up and bombastic to the point of cartoon-esque.
Jin have never been looked this good 😃, can wait to play this masterpeice
I'd have loved to see his devil side mixed with his old tekken 3 moveset again
I like the wings now
1:07 Hot dog cart owner while two half men, half demons are smashing each other over his cart:  "Understandable, have a nice day".
Good god that flip looks horrendous
この風間仁は超かっこいい。 迷いを振り切り、デビルの力を制御し戦う… まさに今の鉄拳の主人公にふさわしい男だ。
Come on we already seen Jin and Kazuya show us bryan fury eddy Steve charachters Like them
The way I fainted………
Holy fists!!!wow😮😮
So there wont be devil jin ?
trash
I wanna see Schiaccisempre playing Jin!
When???????
BRO did nobody notice jin use hehachi strongest move the omen uppercut?....as a Mishima main. I was sad at losing one of my characters. Turns out I lost 2 but my remaining 2 are gods now.
Ya no es lo que era tekken
The more I see this game, the more I wanna play it. Jin looks awesome 🔥
I love how his character developed from “power is everything” to “strength isn’t everything”. Also how jin now has control over his devil gene. Love it!
Em vez de criar golpes originais estão pegando golpes de move set de outros personagens e misturando tudo .... Uf3 da Katarina, db1 Djin dentre outros. Poxa Harada....
Oh God please bring back the cinematic scene for all the characters. I miss them.
Kazuya was way more brutal Jin got that gentle fist
BRING BACK CHRISTIE!
i want alex gameplay trailer
Aight now Sephiroth. Chill your one-winged angel ass out.   Ps. The fit slaps mommas
I hope Jin still parries
Guest Character "Hot Ryu", he trains with Jin to master his Devil Power
It's good that " the pride lady" is announcing the fighters. She's a legend.
WTF Jin ewgf beat Kazuya ewgf !!!!! 🥲🥲 Kazuya mains gonna be mad 😰😰😰
Is Jin Dlc ?
Nice
Waiting for mainman reaction
They fixed Jin. His emo, angsty days are over XD
Power stance looking crazy  and did he just do 2, 4 into zen? OMG!
I really don’t understand why all the uppercut motions sends the opponent tailspinning.
12f punishes into forced mix ups, glue eaters everywhere rejoice!
CHIKARA KOSO SUBETE DA !!!!!
ON MY B DAY LETSSSSSSSS FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOO
fecha para cuandooo??
Wow everthing is different
God man, seeing Jin go from "Power is Everything" to "Strength isn't everything" and incorporating his devil gene into his fighting style is sick! Say what you want about Tekken, but I love that each character's personality can be seen in how they fight, it adds a lot to the game.
Devil jin PLAYERS with yugi voice: Its was supposed to be me
Damn son. This looks badass.
The fact that he has changed from 'Power is everything!' to 'Strength isn't everything.' was such an amazing touch along with the insane gameplay. Can't wait!
I know it's a franchise ending ask but give me a happy ending between these two or have an alternate route in the story mode.
Hold up, let him cook
tekken looking more and more like every other fighting game. took a character with a grounded karate move-set and undermined it all with wacky back-flips and magical powers. if i see characters shooting fireballs in the neutral next trailer im out, for real.
Aris is going to love this.
This Ultimate Move is too Short for Performance Show!!! 💡🤔💡
I love how Jin's moveset looks with his Devil powers mixed in! The man's come so far!  Also this is the third Tekken 8 reveal trailer I've watched, and I'm still *REALLY* hoping they drop the name of the banger music they use in these trailers. Because besides the awesome gameplay this factor is the other reason I keep replaying these trailers.
There is a lot to unpack here: -Jin is going back to his old self again during Tekken 3-5 (Don't know why people saying it's character development)  -He's using his old Mishima moves again along with devil Jin moves  -Maybe this is a long shot but this could be a possibility they may not make devil Jin playable (unless they make him dlc to squeeze every bit of money out of players)
My main my favorite character on tekken games Jin his skills his combat his story the boss
downgraded
Finally got to see favorite Tekken character Jin Kazama... I'm his die hard fan... 🔥❤
Not a fan of some of the special effects, especially when hitting the opponent. It could be just me but I can't see sh!t
He should've used his motorcycle in his super, would've been Cooler!
So they combined Regular Jin and Devil jin in to a single version of Jin i like the idea. Never was a fan of evil duplicates as a thing.
Can’t wait to see Steve Fox
best ver tekken is tekken 5 what is lights in game..it is fight game or light fight?
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Inspired by anime Jin's ability to harness his devil powers without giving in to them.
pretty bad
So they merged him with Noctis
1:09 and this parry?
Disappointed by his shotokan getting spoiled by flashy Lars/Devil Jin tricks
This man is a GOD!!! HE'S BEEN "HIM"
Jin Noctis lucis kazama
1:19 Sounds like they redub his "DAH" for his electric.
The best of the best!!!
NO TIMBS?????
man that hotdog vendor didnt even faze. I need a sturdy wagon like that....  Oh, and Jin looks great. Those "devil" effects are fantastic.
I like his power stance move. His move is much more upgraded than the previous games. I have a feeling his new power stance might be useful. My favorite part is where after the power stance he launches Kazuya with OTGF and wall damages savage sword.
this might mean we will never see devil jin in t8 but i am happy that it is a nice marriage of their movesets
Im a Jin main, but Kazuya has a better Ult than him imo.
everyone in comment be like:  It's so awesome to see jin and devil jin mix moveset  While for me : Jin moveset tekken 8 here is so dumb unlike Kazuya that have more power and strength having new moveset not far away from Tekken 7. While New Jin moveset in tekken 8 looks like Jin Will be Transform to POWER RANGER or KAMEN RIDER, It's so far away from KYOKUSHIN nor MISHIMA style Karate
Nice to see Rock Howard made the roster.
시박!!!!!!!!!!
Well I be super duper darned 🤟🏿🤟🤟🏻
1:08 no one's going to comment on the fact that Jin does a Thunder God Fist? R.I.P Devil Jin as a separate character but, also, looks like Jin has accepted his Mishima bloodline enough to use Mishima style moves again.
honestly, his moveset is a lot less Kazama now and more similar to Lars
As a Jin main, I can honestly say I was smiling before the video even started 😊, I’m excited for T8 I hope you guys are too
Bring back Christie, Baek, Bruce, Roger Jr., Mokujin and Wang ww want them.
Watching this new video, I just remembered SF6.  Both games are underestimating Fighting Gaming, casual gaming, and the common sense of any gamer... There is no gameplay trailer for their previous version.  The lights, the brightness and the colors do not make a game... these two companies are on the wrong path... "NOT EVERYTHING THAT SHINES IS GOLD".... viendo este Nuevo video, me acabo de recordar de SF6. Ambos juegos estan subestimando al Fighting Gaming,  casual gaming, y al sentido comun de cualquier juagdor... No existe un avance de juego de su version anterior. Las luces, el brillo y Los colores no hacen un juego... van por Mal camino estas dos compañias... "NO TODO LO QUE BRILLA ES ORO"....
How is she calm in the hot dog stand
SAVAGE
they really show their passion for tekken in T8 good job!
"what's up guys, MainManSWE here..."
Great change but i preffered Kazuya more as his moveset is more powerful and brutal
They gotta tone down the effects man. It looks so messy
tekken lost its essence too much lights :(
OMG THIS MUSIC! THIS IS HYPE ASF!
So there will be no Devil Jin in tekken 8 because Jin Kazama is having all the moves of Devil Jin now.
Gay costume
Jin became the One Winged Angel.
Where are the graphics from the first trailer??????? :/
Jin: carries out his wall-combo Guy in foodtruck: 🗿
Power is everything >
I can't stop watching
O anjo do Flamengo
Finishing move was janky as hell, not gonna lie
As much as I wanted jin's rage art to top his father's, I could understand that rage art of his symbolizes the journey he had suffering from the devil gene, but now, that power he no longer is afriad of using. Now, that the devil and jin are whole.
The Tekken MC ladies and gentlemen. And I've never been more proud to say that.
Jin has never been my main but after watching this, I might give him a try lol
1:22 That finisher is crazy 🔥
Bro musta borrowed a jacket from lars along with mastering the devils power.
is that Shibuya?
Buff Lars next.
Kazuya’s was still better
Looks good, but his rage art is nothing compared to Kazuya
Oh shi- Jin is now full of confidence, control and humility, all his moves are enhance with the devil gene without losing himself. He is not an emo mess anymore, now he is genuinly cool
Tekken 7: "Power is everything." Tekken 8: "Power isn't everything."  our boy has come a long way folks.
Thank you very much. Cant wait for the other Characters!
Heavy Ragna The Bloodedge vibes from his winpose tbh
Would be nice if they release a boxed version on PC (like Tekken 7)
Please get Kiryu from Yakuza series to this game pls.
This just might be the best version of Jin that we’ve seen yet! The fusion of Devil Jin moves (Kazama Style) with Kazama Karate is pretty sick!
fantastic gameplay
I wasn't much enthousiatic about that game to be honest. Love fight games. I have to admit it's look awesome and badass
That thundaga flip kick though 😮⚡️
I hope the arcade  mode goona be more like 5 figths
we waitr for this great game!!!!!!!!!!!💥💥💥💥💥💥
Not sure what to think of some of his new moves - that jump kick animation at 00.45 looks really bad.   Reminds me of something Eliza would do
Jin fans assemble!!!
Trash RA but clean gameplay overall
Miguel gameplay pls.
It’s a shame I can only like this one time. I’m so hyped for Tekken 8!!
I believe Jin mains from Tekken 7 will be disappointed with this..
Hwoarang next 🎉
They turned my guy into part Iori with the claw moves and part Guile with those flipping and dipping Flash Kicks! Yikes, talk about a more acrobatic Jin! 😲😲😲  I've also noticed that both Jin and Kaz have more of their "Devil" form designs in their regular moves. It's like Kazuya isn't holding back anymore on Jin and Jin has to show his father once and for all that he is the strongest, even going as far as mastering the Devil Gene.
Did I just 2d jumping maneuvers on the man?
MY BOYYYYYY
One FC, announcer?
Unlimited Hotdogs!!
please give me the soundtrack <3
que perron!!!
I’ve never wanted to play Jin until now, (ima Steve main)
1:07 was that an Omen??
Wait, so no more Devil Jin? :( Those backflip moves are kinda goofy
Jin is everything.
jin+raven+sephi
Day 1 buy!!!
Characters be breaking concrete floors when landing from combos then there's that hotdog stand at 1:10
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE CHANGE THIS COMENTATOR.
My boi jin lets fucking go!!!!!
The music is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Fantastic!!!🔥🤯 Finally Jin get moveset that he deserves!🔥✊🙂💪💪👊👊👍
Damn I was hoping we won't be getting devil Jin due to him having more control over his powers. But seeing as he didn't transform ww mightvstill get DJ
please make a remake of tekken 5 🙏
I wanna see a jun kazama trailer next
Jin was always my favourite when it came to juggling
Yes we saw the wings, we understood that he had the devil gene, you don't have to show them on every move lol
Glad i learned him in tekken 7
My tekken 3-7 main looking fine. Can't wait to play him in tekken 8.
I loved
Please make a better super !!!!!!!!!! He so op looking
I'm surprised the hotdog vendor is still standing...
Νice 2015 graphics
My wish came true 😂
Me 😲😲😲when I see his Omen stance again
Jin's new devil moves are likely to eliminate Devil Jin as a playable character
Meh... Jin got nothing on kazuya new moves
Looks soooo good!! cant wait to play him
I don’t think he has his parry guys I’m scared
Wow Jin seems to have more control of himself and the devil gen instead of become a monster form like Kazuya he summons his power without transform
He going to be cheap ass he'll lmaoo
1:10 I love how the ice cream guy just doesn't care
When can I buy it? I'm so excited
Jin: Dorya!  He said it! He said the thing!
Jin looks dope. I'm still not sure about all the cinematic angles in the video, i guess some are just for the trailer but i'm a bit scared this will be confuse the fight. Wait and see.
Let’s gooooi Jin make us proud 🥲 😭😭😭😭😭gotta love the combos and outfit tho
This game is gonna shake the world ❤
Jin look cool asf, I'm just hoping the nigga in the hotdog stand is aight 1:07
Might as well start giving all the characters meter
I miss the old voice actor
F4 is back ✨✨✨
idk if I like how they changed Jin tbh.. Looks like Jin & DVJ mixed together ? Still can't wait to play 'em tho.
We have to have devil Jin back
Devil Jin is dead
Guy at 1:10: I’M JUST TRYING TO SELL HOTDOGS!!!!
1:09 no Jin! Not the hotdog stand!  Fo real tho this trailer was sick.
nyc
new challenge jin kazam fabulous
dud got dvj and kazuya moves, then what about dvj i hope he gets a rework in his moveset too
Damn this seems like we won't get DVJ but damn does he look aggressive loving his new found calm and confidence
Do you think that there will be no separate Devil Jin character?
Jin and Kazuya have always been my favorite so I'm happy to see they both look 🔥🔥 from what I can tell gameplay is gonna be the best but imo Tekken's story is just as important. Can't wait to see where it goes
"i shall not wavu wavu again..."
Lol 1:10 Hot Dog girl doesn't even flinch. She fears nothing.
So does this mean Devil Jin won’t be a standalone character anymore??? 😭
The food truck is about to be smashed, but the people inside are calm.
The Most impresive Calmness i have ever seen... the guy in the hotdog stand cookin meanwhile a man is being beaten agains you cart 1:10
GIVE ME BRYAN!!!
The epic fight between father and son, bearers of the cursed blood  1:18 Where one gets bounce repeatedely againts a hotdog truck
Wow the backflip at 0:47 is beautiful, maybe Jin will be overpowerd like back in Tekken 4.
Man him switching sides a lot is kinda annoying, now I have to learn how to ewhf on both sides
I see a visible downgrade from the first trailer vs kazuya....
wtf
Didn’t expect to get another banger trailer so soon , man this games looking good !
That was fantastic ineed. Damn the game looking clean as hell. I hope they release a demo later this year.
A good fight.
"I shall not waver again" says the guy that started World War 3
I need that jacket!
Loving the soundtrack to this game!
Melhor personagem de Tekken de todos os tempos!  Namco, não tirem esse personagem de maneira nenhuma!
YES!!!!!
Devil Jin is hella gone. At least from the base roster.
Jin’s rage art seems lacking. Kazuya’s is MUCH more impactful. Otherwise Jin looks amazing. Mixing the Kazama style with his Devil style!
Imagine getting beat up against a food truck 🚚
Only tekken 3 was awesum, remake it and it will be superhit
WOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤯🤯🤯😲🤤😁😁😁😁
This new game is gonna be lit I’m really not feeling this announcer though lol
:)
We want baki
Did Jin learn a new move from guile from street fighter?
1:26 One Winged Angel
Strength isn't everything. My guy WTF you talkin bout!? 🤬
Bro These charakter announcer is horrible
Was checking if he'd do the godfist. Can't tell to sleepy
They only got one stage ready or?
The Mishima Zaibatsu CEO that Heihachi could never be. The Man who Destroyed Ogre, Destroyed his biological Great Grandfather Jinpachi, Destroyed Azazel, Cold-Bloodedly Embarrassed his biological father Kazuya, grandmother Kazumi and grand father Heihachi because of his Mother's Love Jun Kazama. The one and only Mishima Bloodline Destroyer and Protagonist/Prodigy of the Tekken Series who up to this moment still my Favorite Character since Tekken 3 none other than Jin Kazama Mishima himself.  Strength Isn't Everything Without The Power of Love & Faith 👊😎
Wow jin has very good mixups and I am really excited to lars next
THIS LOOK SO COOL WTH, i'm so glad they went into the more flashy direction with the way they display the moves man. that rage art aint better than kazuya's tho
As a Jin main only thing got me hype was moved mix with devil Jin and omen stance
Yeah, look like I'll keep maining Jin
MY BOY IS BAAAAAAACK
So the super move is an upper cut with a DmC Dante Stinger 🤔
ZA HANDO GA KESU !
아나운서 영어발음 너무 구려
I need all supers to look like kaz or better 😤
My boi
Goat
WTF, too many special effects and abrupt frame cuts... where is the FLUIDITY of 60FPS?
Our baby has grown his own wings and is flying high!!!    His character growth- 'strength isn't everything' and 'I shall not waver again' !!!   He looks fabulous!!   This is True Jin!!  But guys, i'm scared of what they'll do to Jin now that he's entered his final character arc - I really hope they don't kill him off for real this time just as he's accepted and come to terms with who he is
game looks great until they fight and its just a fuckin shitshow of stupid over used effects and sounds. this game looks like it will be less fun to play than tekken 7... cant wait :/
Please make tekken force as tekken 6
Just sitting here waiting to see Yoshimitsus new design
1:21 that stance 😱😱😱
When this game come out someone in the comments know
How can a video have 14k likes while it has 12k views?
Are you Sephiroth?
MY BOY!!!!!!!
Too flashy and too messy. Its hard to follow what is actually going on there … Sorry but I don’t like it :(
Strength isn’t everything made me cream
Who Think Kazuya Is better than Jin Hitt Like
Jin: “Power is everything.”  Jun: “Um, lil boy, that is NOT what I taught you! 🤨  Jin: “Oh damn, you right mom…my bad. Strength isn’t everything.”  Jun: “THAT’S my boy. 😇👍”
🤔you know what I liked...Jins development and Kazuya getting knocked on his ass
God bless, Devil Jin wont appear back thanks to Tekken 8 Jin.
Перебор с эффектами, как по мне, честно говоря. Очень уж решили сделать «для эпилептического припадка»
This looks much better than SF6
Finally the Best fighter is here
Tekken 7: Power is Everything Tekken 8: Strength Isn't Everything  The One of the Badass Character Development I've Seen
Tekken 8: everyone is noctus
So now he’s son of Rock Howard and Lars Alexandersson?
Man imma be honestly. This game looks amazing, visually stunning and gameplay looks perfect on how they handle combos and impact sounds and all that. That's all good, but the effects are just too much. All those small particles may need to be tuned down a little bit. Making it sometimes look like a scratchy screen.
The Hot Dog Stand owner is the strongest character in ALL of Tekken.
"Strength isn't everything." That line made me feel old! My boy has become a man!
He's back letting him self return to jin kazama Tekken3
Did they changed his voices?
This version of Jin is so  cool, the fact that he is more in control now blending his devil powers with his fighting style is amazing. The way he fights and looks is amazing. The rage Art is still pretty underwealming but all the rest is really cool
Is the announcer sound the same which is in these trailer. I am not digging that its like a man screaming. Everything else looks good cant wait to play it
Excellent job
Lesss gooo
Jin ain't had this much drip since 4 LOVE IT
No thanks im waiting for mortal kombat
I hope they change the announcer, is super annoying
We not gone talk about how he got Dragunov’s down 2 ??? I will THIS IS GREAT!!!! both are my mains …with Lars and Lei W ❤️‍🔥
Jin is a beast 😎🙌🏻
looks same as tekken 6
I hope use ,,The World,,(Zauardo!!)
샤프한 이미지에서 묵직한 이미지로 바뀐거같네
I hope that they make a trailer of Law…
He’s my favourite character. The best 🔥.
IGN action will hero 💪 and of longplays xbox xsx y ps5 is one new it wwe tekken 8 2023 this year blood war bloodmian I lcy California
진이 샤프트 생겼네 ㄷㄷㄷㄷ
Holy Crap!!
cool but. nah! you need ultra instinct to play defense in tekken 8
I'm so EXCITED! 😍😱 can't wait for it 😇
This is not the tekken we've known. Hopefully it feels good to play.
This is great, my boy got character development and is what he used to be like before power corrupted him. Guess uncle Lars and Jun knocked some sense into him. Still, it would have been really hype to see some Kazama Style moves in his kit in addition to the devil transformation stuff.
Jin Kazama Is amazing, The New costume Is incredible, New skills in The fight, New powers, WOW Is much better that Kazuya Mishima. Jin Kazama Is my favorate character.
I like that it seems Jin has control over Devil Jin and is incorporating his moves into his own moveset.
Devil Jin is no longer a separate character his moves has now been incorporated into Jin's plus there is more Leroy references in this trailer just like the last one with Kazuya
I amazing that in thy I Jin power rangers my ultimate iron 👊⚡tournament 8 fight Playstation 5 and Xbox xsx new game ign action 🎬 hero 📺 🖥
1:09. Jin's first blue spark attack.
Hm... So it's 1 character reveal trailer per week aprox?  Interesting... If we have between 30 and 40 characters... We have at least 7 to 9 months of wait. Just random speculation.   I'm excited to know the new fighting styles. I really hope some Wang /taiji  - internal style. And no. Leroy Smith while cool is quite different for me.
After 24 years I'm back. But guys we have to be real. How can we enjoy this if our world is crumbling.
That was awesome
Do you know that Jim “One Winged Angel” Kasama and Sephiroth are relative parents?
Jun would be so so proud 🥲
Xiaoyu  Return
would you look at that. he uses mishima move through omen stance at 1:06
Rock howard victory pose.
you can't choose your family...or the videogame engine, all use Unreal Engine
1:17 that was tight when he kicked him and he slide on the ground
Jin saw the Kazuya trailer and said "Now it's my turn Father!"
i guess devil jin got removed from the game
Jin was always a cool character and I've always wanted to learn him. This makes me want to learn him even more
Hope Jun is coming soon. I notice jin doesn't use laser much either.
Give us Yoshi Bandai Cmon.
Should have given him a similar rage art to Kazuya or the one where he does a little combo and transforms into his devil form and lasers Kazuya to oblivion.
b3 into 1,3 is now a mix with his 3+4. Now thats insane
Wow I am loving tekken 8 mechanics,  Looking forward to T8 and SF6,  both these fighting games were really cool especially my android 18 Cammy.
1:00. People thought they are going to nerf forward 4 but guys now it launches on simple hit. Really, that damn buff will make jin a broken character.
What have they done to my boi...Devil Jin sucks AAAAAAASS...not 15 anymore I guess. I've been maining this dude since T3 and Mishimas since T1...and now I can 100% confirm, not gonna happen for T8. I'm not feeling his new moveset at all. Gonna stick to CHAD KAZUYA, also, really hope Heihachi turns out to be as epic as Kazuya.   Gonna fill Jin's space with Feng, Steve or Brian. Let's goooooooooo
😮
The bounce feature returns 😒🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ here come the sweats
1:10 , the guy in the hotdog cart did not give a fk.
Jin : Strength is EVERYTHING  Evil Jin : Strength isn't EVERYTHING
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
no more 2 separate Jins ??
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Bro is going to be an instant S tier
Now we can say goodbye to devil jin 👋
Blah blah character development… DID THEY JUST GIVE JIN A DIVE KICK?!??!? 👀 😳🧐
they copied Rock Howard's Winged Win Pose.
Yet there’s still no release date
I'm watching this drunk, and I don't know what tf is going on
0:48. Animation of 2nd hit of zen 1,2 has now been changed. I really like that. Because in previous games, every time you do zen 1,2 at the end of combo the last hit misses. Now the new ender has longer range but less wall carry so it going to be 50/50
WHY IS THE F4 STILL THERE!!!
Woman in the shop be like :- stop hitting my shop 😂😂
Too much fireworks 🎉
MY NEW MAIN
I can't wait for  more old Cast Return  for Takken  8 season❤🤩💯💯💯⚡⚡🤯🎂🥳🥂🥂👍👍 Excellent
that one wing effect is kinda no sense
I liked kazuya's RA more. Apart from rage art my man nailed everything!!
"Strength isn't everything". Yeah power is everything that's why 😂
When Tekken 7 first came out, I thought it would have been the best one in the franchise. But, Tekken 8 has already been exceeding my expectations so far that I’m very impressed and confident that this will be the best! Kudos to Harada and Bandai Namco for stepping up their game!
Where tf is jun show jun
jin transformed from devil jin to rock howard
I like how the mishimas in these trailers look like they have the capacity to overshadow every other character in the roster.
Mmm something seems off, bye bye classic Tekken:( , it's like street fighter mix with mk
When you saw the improvement between Street Fighter 5 and SF6, this tekken is lime....
1:10 hotdog stand guy didn't even distance himself from the fight like the cops did 😂😂. He more afraid of his bills .
Downgrade level max
So, it's basically Tag 2 Jin or Devil Within Jin but cooler.
존나미쳤네
Jun would be so happy!
Imagine being the guy in the hotdog stand at 1:09 and it's the first day on the job or it was supposed to be your day off.
Sephiroth Jin
Jin got a Mishima move back
Where’s Baki
Awesome!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥I wonder if it’s safe to say there won’t be a separate ‘Devil Jin’ character in this game?
jin: strength isn't everything vergil: FOOLISHNESS!
Poor graphics
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Kono powah daaa!?!?!?! Base Jin + devil gene combinations in his movesets looks great! Might need to get a good PC for this
All the Jin mains right about now  : 🗿🍷
0:42. 2,4 no longer knock downs on simple hit now. Big nerf. Weakening his 10 frame punishment. But good thing about it is that it now cancels into zen and a new jumping kick in zen is amazing.
The one-winged devil.
Unless they offering a one million dollar prize, this is going to die in the water next to SF. You can already see it in the views.
Both Jin and Ryu overcame their demonic power it seems like
Well my main looks sweet, you can release the game now 🤭
we got our good charismartic boy jin back
will baki really be in tekken 8?
Woah! this game still looks normal! I'm hyped.
I'm excited to see what's max reaction to this
Devil Jin is dead.
Cool! Kazuya's better though
All the particle effects spam looks rancid.
"he's so hot"  Sakura, probably... The one from Naruto not SF
never been so hype for jin but holy hell, jin is really at his prime right now man im so fired up!
finally he said strength isn't everything
Guys : notice he said strength isn't everything.. He never said power isn't everything .. big  difference..
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING  Now, Jin is shonen protagonist😆
If jin wins against kazuya I'm never buying a bandinamco product again
This is cool & all but, can we get a release date already.
The Pride announcer lady doing the character introductions is giving me so much hype. Its an MMA thing
Omen stance is back!
Yeah we definitely getting this game in 2023. The fact that these trailers are damn near coming 2x. Per month said that there nearly done with the game
Where is yoshi? ;-;
the new announcer is just perfect man i love it so much
Tekken is going kof or street fighter?   Tekken is going turbo ! 🤪🤔😅🤣😭😭😭😭
*Armor King Gameplay Trailer next*
Waiting for howarang and Bruce Irving now 😁
Tekken 8 looked so good in the first trailer and these new gameplay shots don’t look much different than tekken 7,mk 11 looks better than this
Jin has accepted being a Mishima AND a Kazama.
😭Side Stepping Has Been ACKNOWLEDGED
This announcer is... something else, I hope this is only for trailers, pls...
Devil Jin is finally no longer playable in the base roster, tekken team made their decision to cut him out and then becoming part of jin's moveset and rage art. But then someone heard rumors that devil jin will be playable only in the story mode. Just like devil kazuya where he fights akuma
Too much effects 🤢
Matured Jin
This looks and feels great, Jin looks and sounds amazing. It's obvious that every member of the team at Namco is working very hard to deliver a great game. Can't wait for the OST either, looking forward to Ajurika and Rio's work. Ajurika has been delivering hits for Tekken for more than 20 years! He's great!
So did Jin go train with Guile for a while because this looks more like street fighter.
Idk how that glizzy stand took that punishment
HIS VOICES OMG, I LOVE IT!!!
I like the video as a tekken fan but Kazuya looks more better than Jin in Tekken 8
shout out to the dude selling hot dogs, minding his business
The best part of this trailer is hearing how Lenne Hardt is saying Jin's name 😍 Pure bliss
Finally! Jin and Devil Jin have become one! Muahaha! My two mains Jin and Kazuya are complete! Mishima Devils are in full effect! Let's go!
YES!!! I was waiting for some Jin gameplay!! His combos look so cool and I love the changes to him. With the integration of Devil Jin, he can finally be at his full power. I can't wait to play, I'm excited!!!
~~ boss how many times we showing wings on attacks ~~ ~~ Yes~~
There goes all hope I had for Zafina coming back. She ain't gonna fit this games style.
This isn't jin kazama, this man jin alexandersson
YOSHIMITSU WHEN??? THANK YOU THO, BANDI!!
Jin has become so Rock Howard
Rock howard?
" Strenght isn't everything " > *switching to Kazama Style*  Perfection.
0:47 Jin has a fkn Flashkick...😲... I'm maining him.
Finally new combos
All the people here saying character development probably only played T6/7. Jin wasn’t like that in 4/5.  Regardless though I am ad he’s seemingly steering towards the right path again. It’s been over a decade irl.   His gameplay looks sick though I do mourne the loss of Devil Jin as a separate character.   Still can’t wait to play him
I think Costume and some moveset are resembling to king of fighters character Kyo
Amazing.
With all the new abilities they seem to be giving Jin I hope he'll remain the "Ryu" of Tekken, i.e. the balanced all-rounder that new players can pick up and learn with immediately.
0:38. The power crush down 1 has new extension now, looks like the input is down 1, (during hit) 2. Strict timing. Damn it. Oh god, natural combo.
kiryu solos
Legend is back 🔥
Looks amazing. Jin and Kazuya actually look like father and son.
can't he became davil jin or he didn't control that power yet
"Strength isn't everything." Face turn?
anime ass moveset I'll stick w kaz
That's it. That is TEKKEN.
Jin's drip is beyond this game now.
Ok jin been training wit lars now he has lars kick
I felt like Kazuya was hitting harder than Jin, when comparing this trailer to Kazuya's trailer.🤣
MY GOODNESS I CANT WAIT FOR THIS GAME
I can't wait to get my ass Doug in by him!!!!!!
will Devil Jin still be a separately playable Character tho? If not then that moveset is just completely gone T_T
This announcer is worse than 7 and that was awful
Dude…This is easily the best Jin has ever been in Tekken. He’s been my main since Tekken 3 (Even though I suck at Tekken and I have to keep relearning it.)   Everything about him is amazing in this game. His characterization finally moving past his Tekken 6 iteration, incorporating the Devil gene into his moves, etc.  0:47 and 0:58 Flash kick?!  0:57, 1:13, 1:22 , He also has Rock’s moves?  1:32 Max is gonna lose it!  I can’t wait for the next character reveal!
So he’s both devil and normal Jin.   LETS GO
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This looks fire. Can't wait for Lars' trailer.
Im just concerned with the hotdog vendor if she is alright after that wall combo.
That crazy looking horse stance parry looks like it would break both of his own elbows. XD
His fit is so tuff ! 😭🔥🔥
0:58 WTF
Can you make this announcer just do the whole thing please?
Did they change the voice actor?
Damn, his D2 look slower
Damn since when is Jin this cool. I will stop calling him an edgelord (maybe)
“Power is something give or take I guess” -Jin Kazama
bruh, someone likes Rock Howard a little too much
Hmmm there's too many billboards with Leroy's name in it and even a coffee shop with Leroy's face as their logo. I mean the name of the coffee shop itself is Smith Coffee. There's also the statue of Leroy and Sugar. I get that this is New York and Leroy came from there but...STOP THE TEASE! SHOW US THE LEROY GAMEPLAY TRAILER!
That hot dog stall is so strong that it didn't even break after all his punches lol
Guess it's a mix between Jin and Devil Jin? Not a fan of how unkarate he seems to play tbh, the whole wing thing really reminds me of Rock Howard.
Coooooool!!! P. S. King next pls
Legend 😍👍🏻
Most hype I've been for Jin since like T5 Love this character again
Shadow integration. Jin and Ryu have both transcended.
Jin Main loving it😁
He looks and all but im here waiting for a trailer for Yoshimitsu or King.
Looks unfinished. Hope they don't rush this game out just cuz Street Fighter 6 looks incredible and MK12 is releasing as well. No more vanilla tekken please.
1:19. Jin's ewhf is faster than kazuya's ewgf by 1 or 2 frames and now leads to a vertical screw ender. A question here is that do ewhf still launch on simple hit
1:29DETROIT SMASH
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING.  CORRECT!  CHALLENGE IS EVERYTHING!
The goat is here
YES YES YES
Omg, Sephiroth! 🤣
Dragon ball xenovers is really quiet since
So the high vertical spins initiate bounds when they land, plus it leaves the opponent a lot closer to you?  I'm assuming there's going to be at least 2 different types of spins and a handful of hit animations depending on how you're launched.
Bro is one winged angel
When is the fkn release FINALLY??? 😭😭😭
Sparkling sparkles, twinkling twinkles, and flashing flashes, yaaay. Happy for the short attention span crowd, they can stay entertained now.  I remember when an electric uppercut used to mean something. Oh well.
YES I KNEW IT! Jin's trailer is here. Now Xiaoyu, Hwoarang, Asuka or Lili next!
Jin's story in every game can be told through his move list
Wow animations are insane
We need King gameplay trailer...
Love this version of Jin ! He looks so badass ! I can't wait to see Ling Xiaoyu... Hopefully she will not continue her fall into twig-girl-with-b00bs since tekken 7 console ver. Next trailer !! <3
That Leroy and Bob's Burgers banner in the back got me hyped.
My dude they mix some of devil jin move into original jin my man this disserves a main after so long. Armor king is not gonna be in Tekken 8 but I still have jin plus the best wafu aaahhhhh Juuuuun
This new version of Jin is looking really good
If any of y'all remember the Tekken 6 mishima story summary, you know Jin ended up repeating the cycle by the end of the story saying "Power is everything." Just like Kazuya said.  Him acknowledging that Strength isn't everything means he's finally breaking the cycle of hatred and anger the Mishimas built for so long.
So there is no DJ? Sadge
킹오브 파이터 후속작 인가요?
Plz do king justice
Could this mean Jin and devil Jin are the same characters
They turned my boy into Lars.
Some of those flippy moves look more like they belong to Lars than Jin or even Devil Jin.
Talk about one winged angel style😃
"I shall not water again" Im not gonna sugarcoat it
My 2 mains are a beasts Kaz/Jin 🔥
Best thing they could do for tekken 8 would be reduce the juggling and take out the bounce system.
All these gameplay reveal trailers are making Tekken look more like a 2D game than a 3D game.
Spilling the glizzy truck damn
Why no one says that anoncer is just horrible?
EDGELORDS RISE
OMG Jin said it "Strength isn't everything" Wang Jinrei would be so proud. A reference to Wang Jinrei's Tekken 5 interlude "Power isn't the same thing as strength. Those who don't know the difference will never be able to defeat me"
Epic
Jin Kazama, Sephiroth would like to have a word with you.
And with every installment, Jin looks less Japanese and more Turkish lol
Jin stole Lee's while rising backflip
1:04 Kazuya is absolutely EATING that pavement, scapula is all f*cked up.
I personally want to see Kazuya beating Jin Kazama in tekken 8
Leo please...
If u look carefully... U can see the devil gene mark appear on his forehead every time he do winged attack
Who's gonna sugarcoat the most with the EWGF: Jin or Kazuya?
OH MY GOD I LOCE THIS NEW JIN
Thats my guy (Nice character development)
Let’s all appreciate the fact we lived to see the day Jin says “Strength isn’t everything”
Oh look, Noctis reveal trailer!
Max is gonna flip after watching the cool Devil Gene hybrid move list. Also the soundtrack is still hype AF. It sounds like a mix of Tekken 5 mixed in with Tekken 7.
1:07 🌭  Jin : Dad I want an hotdog 🥺  Kaz : No 😒  Jin : Please...😤  Kaz : No 😠  Jin : 😭😡🤬🤬😭🤬😭🤬😤🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬😭🤬 I HATE YOU !!!
*O _ O!!!  100 000 000/100 000 000!!!*
Ну и сранина)
Jin seems...happier?
tekken 8 croosplay xbox, ps5 ,pc ?
my guy!!!!!!
Trazer trailer de revelação de personagem que já foi revelado é meio paia, né.  Qual vai ser o proximo trailer de revelação? Do Paul? Minha nossa!!!  Eu vou ficar muito surpreso em saber que ele estará no jogo! Afinal, eu não sabia, né?!
ling xiao yu next pleaseee
"strength isn't everything" My dude you started a global war that killed tens or hundreds of millions because you are scared of your monster genes, 'strength' was never your thing.
Jin's gameplay is much better than Kazuya.
Everytime I see that one winged from Jin, I think about Sephiroth and Cloud from Final Fantasy.
Jin’s outfit is awesome. I would like to dress the same way
His special finisher move should of been more better than just one punch. 🤔
Jin is so strong now🥶
His new voice reminds me of his tekken 3 and tag tournament 1 voice
Ahh it's Jin Pro max fully paid.
The change in camera angles is gonna be trippy at first
Time for that release date
that strongest hotdog truck
Minimal special effects so I can appreciate the models and moves more. That is what I like to see. Nina's had me concerned
God damn, is Devil Jin gone? And Jin now has Heihachi's DB 2.... I always thought they should slomo launchers if both moves have high potential to kill with follow combo.
Jin is an anime character :P
The super is underwhelming, but the rest of it was sick!
Of course now there won’t be a separate character called Devil Jin :) always thought it was weird as there were only a few moves that made them Devil Jin different to Jin.
The victory pose kinda reminds me of Ragna lowkey
Finally some new combos, enough the same combos in all games
gawd its look awful.....the new move doesnt look good/fit on him, it looks clunky especially the backflip, its like they force it to him, it doesnt look good at all, and his RA look underwhelming comapred to kaz, even to paul and law.....just awful
This looks all fine and dandy but how is that online net code looking tho I'm tired of having a good ass match just to get dropped to main menu
My guy move like real Kazama now!
Hey 70 bucks, alright Amigo
Looks like leroy taught jin his parry move at 1:07 (i think) thats pretty cool!
DEYM gonna miss old voice line of jin, mostly the grunts.     TSU!
Glad to see Jin go back to his Tekken 4 persona, the one that gave him solid character development.
Ehh
lars its you?
I just wanted to see the character select screen
So are we to believe Devil Jin won't be a separate character anymore since Jin is using D. Jin's moves now?
TEKKEN 8 LOOKS LIKE SOUL CALIBUR 5 AND DEAD OR ALIVE HAD A BABY (IN TERMS OF GAMEPLAY) I MEAN IS IT ME OR THIS GAME LOOKS LKE ITS GONNA FLOP I GET A REALLY STRONG ARCADE VIBE
Needless to say, we're not getting Devil Jin
Jin finna D2??
bro became an EX character 😭😭
His rage art causes side switch? Better kill if it’s against the wall.
Ngl the amount of backflips and wings growing out and back in feels so fucking off. Also higher pitched anime-esque grunts for no good reason.
에이 아빠보단 임팩트가 약하네 카즈야진짜 뽕 제대로 취했는데 ㄷㄷ
Jin's character development gave him new drip
Looks ok. One of the best ones so far which ain't saying much. I like the voice acting but isn't it going against the theme of making the characters look and act older? Sound like what he should've sounded like years ago and not like that garbage anime. I really hope they get rid of the Pride FC lady in the actual game.
Tekken may cry 8
이번엔 데빌진 안나오나? 데빌진 + 라스한테 영향받은것 같은 중2병 같은 무브를 잔뜩 흡수해서 돌아왔네
Man, Jin has sure come a long way. Now I just need to wait and see what Maximilian thinks of this
Nooooo! Farewell Devil Jin
Just jamming out to the stage's music. 🔥
Is anyone feeling cartoonish free-fire type
Oh nah...They really went above and beyond, Powerstance into Mishima CD1, This man might have his omen stance back and I love the fact that it is literally all of him rather than a split of himself between 2 characters its already fucking awesome man
No sidestep, they want it to be a 2d game so hard
Jin gets better with age
Let’s goooo keep them coming !  I can’t wait for my favorite Cyborg Byron
Why still no release date ?
Banger soundtrack. Jin look amazing like always also knew that was his rage art in the reveal trailer.
bangin electronic soundtrack that's what Im here for
Looks gorgeous. But too flashy .  I prefer when Tekken was more simple. Maybe I've just gotten older.  Im over 40 now and 1st played tekken as a teen.
10k views and 10k likes damn
This will be my first Tekken.  God have mercy on me.
Love it
Okay yay Jin but I’m still waiting for some real reveals… come on already
Please Rugal Bernstein in Tekken 8!
This trailer sucked. Jin doing random ballerina flips mid combo, the intros sucked, the outro is corny and the one wing look makes Jin look like a knockoff Sephiroth. Drop the next trailer
Eyyy I'm excited for my boy right here. His moves look nice and he seems to be more flashy here with some mixture of his devil form. Seeing the dialogue "power isn't everything" makes me excited about the idea that they finally fixed his character from what he was in Tekken 6. He looks great, and I can't wait for more.
Really feels like he's got a lot more flavour as a character now, with his bursts of red, black, and feathery attacks
Anybody noticed "Leroy" written on one digital billboards and "Smith coffee" ? I guess leroy smith has 80% chance of being in tekken 8
Lars looking good
I came
졸라 멋있다
Jin was more elegant and graceful in his combat. I honestly dont like that they switched it up in this fashion
We need Jin’s super to be updated and more cinematic like kazuyas
AGRESSION IS EVERYTHING!!! LOOK AT ABUSE AGAINST THE HOT DOG STAND?
Do Yoshimitsu next!
I'm sorry but please... just modernize all the character designs. They're really crap now, a product of their time. The hairs have got to go for a start
So they combine DEVIL Jin completely 🤔 idk if I'm going to like this. Hoping They DEVIL JIN A SEPARATE character 😔.  I do like some of the new moves. Just tried of them dumbing down the Mishimas to help  Lucky Chloe Leroy users.
Having Jin in the good guys team and in control of himself again is a great oportunity to use his original theme! Return his Tekken 3 music! Or remix it. It is one of the greatest in the entire series!
Kazuya combo best 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dooriyaaa
Rip devil Jin
Where's Baki?
So it's looking like his moveset is a combination of Jin and Devil Jin
announcer still keeps me vomiting
looks like 'KYO' in KOF
1:10 bro in the hotdog truck just chillin while the truck is going through it💀
They did exactly what I wanted with his moveset. I can't wait for the Dood's and Main Man's reactions to this.
If there's anyone that needs a Supreme jacket photoshopped onto them now, it's this guy.
Inject Tekken 8 content into my veins. Can’t wait for lee chaolan reveal trailer
It's amazing that they're doing all of these character trailers and we still don't have a release date.
Fact: I also have the Devil Gene.  Fact: In my case, it just makes me fart uncontrollably.  I'm sorry.
What I would give to see "Ip Man" or Mike Tyson in this edition.
A fusion of the two?! Devil Jin and Jin! Let's go!
Still waiting for Mokujin trailer
His gameplay trailer looked boring!!
1:22 JIN DORYA IS REALL
daaamn he developed from a karate guy into a kamen rider 😆  badass moves tho
FINALLY MY CROPS ARE WATERED MY WOUNDS ARE HEALED MY BOI IS HEREEEEEE
Is the announcer Lenne Hardt? PRIDE FC!
Looks like Devil Jin is won't make it to Tekken 8. Jin has full control of the devil gene now :D
the flips are funny though his new Super makes him look like a Edgy One-Winged Rock Howard Rip Off ^^;
1:06 - that poor hotdog vendor
Too much Call of Duty, and the chip damage sucks also.
WHY ARE THEY RELEASING SO MANY TRAILER I CANT AHHHHHHHH
The announcer sounds like his finna preach 🤣
0:31 Snake confirmed for Tekken 8
Am I a little worried about how distracting the background can be? And maybe for competitive they will ban certain stages?
TEEEEKKKKKKEEEEENNNNNNN
Jin in the thumbnail be like” your girl is mine now”
I love that Kazuya and Jin have movesets that fully incorporate their devil powers and just aren’t the same as they’ve been for a while.
Finally, a new moveset for Jin they are now doing justice to him.  Can't wait to try those combos
Namco’s been spoiling us lately. Can’t wait to see jun’s gameplay trailer
This man done turned into Lars
Jin Kazama the war criminal
so... his fist just got... bigger? wtf??
Despite WWIII, Jin's heart was always on the right path. Let's just see wait & see how much lore they'll be cooking with
Ha Jin borrowed snake's line 😅
Whoa Nice my favorite just became cooler and better
*I have an exam tomorrow. But this seems important*
"Power is not the same as the strength"- Wang Jinrei
¿Para cuándo gameplay de Jun Kazama Deidad? 😍   Ñ n't? Para los gringos
Jin went from being edgy to straight badass!!
This pretty much confirms Devil Jin not it’s own character this game it would almost be pointless to add him with Jin doing all this
HYPE TRAIN, all board!
I know its just me but hearing "new challenger" for a staple character feels inessential honestly.
Not flashy as daddy Kaz
Oh my god jin after kazuya. Such a big reveal. New moves of jin are very impressive. I really like that 3+4 extension after zen 1,3. Very amazing new thing is that he finally got omen stance which is now a power crush and leads jin to transform into tekken 3 style move list and martial art. Interesting thing to note about tekken 8 is that jin no longer needs a mishima tag partner to enter omen stance just as kazuya in tekken 8 no longer needs to be transferred into devil form in order to do a laser beam. Another good thing is that when I noticed omen stance carefully I saw that omen stance can now be able to cancel into crouch dash just as his zen stance. This change is actually amazing and one thing guys, where is his heat smash(an attack that spends two heat energies and is commonly a low attack) e. g. kazuya's new hell sweep and Paul's new sweep with sway 2 extension.
i'm still waiting for Hwoarang
Jin is now the One Winged Devil.
It went from father hitting the son, to son hitting the father.
LETS FUGGING GOOO
That super is a let down compared to Kazuyas. Cool Trailer tho
Can't put my finger on it. But im not feeling it yet. And all them effects aint covering up  how the combat is flowing. Maybe a King trailer will get me Hype. Where are the Defensive Options 🤔 Maybe a Demo will feel better 🤔.
This is nice, but Kazuya still takes the cake!
As a jin main i am very satisfied
It took exactly 4 games since Tekken 4....for Jin to come back to the light. I freaking love it.
All it took was starting WW3 and commiting Genocide to overcome his fear and heritage, proud of you Jin!
What's up with Japanese and their obsession with the devil?
It seems that not only developed as character, also his fighting style. Starting with Mishima Karate style, after suposed ''traditional'' karate, and now finally found his own fighting style.
Mohammad Jin bin Al-Kazuya Mishima De Kazama
Its about time Jin figured it out.  The story arc is about to expand something fierce.   I'm worried about game play tho, this sh!t feels so SNK right now.   Might have to skip T8!
I'm Speechless, Confused and Amazed. This a whole new version I didn't expect. Also happy that I'm seeing inherited moves of Heichachi in both characters in their unique way.
Tekken Fans KEKW
Did he say “doriya”?
I didn't complain at all during Kazuya's trailer but in this trailer I can barely see the moves with all the sparks.
Looks awesome but that announcers is horrendously cheesy as fu@#$
Is it just me, or do a some of the moves look SOO extra for no reason?🧐
So no more devil jin I presume
I think WE will haven't 1 Devil Jin séparés character anymore.
God dammit, square and namco. If you can bring noctis, in, bring in the TRUE one winged angel… SEPHIROTH!
Shaheen kazama!! With a 12f punish into juggle. Lmao...
Did he learn that crazy flip from Lars???
Damn, a fusion between Jin and devil jin?
Jin looks perfect 👌🏽
Hope they give him some of his Mishima style karate back
LMAO they really did merge DJ into jin moveset. rip all devil jin main.
hot dog vendor doesn't give a fuk
these black wing effects...... what is he? nega-Rock Howard? or is he channeling his inner Ragna the Bloodedge with those wing effects
TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT
Tekken is NOT playing with the development of these characters
1:10--The hell's that hot-dog stand made of?
jin have dragunov down 2???
아니 ㅅㅂ 말이되?  아니 철권8 ㅈㄴ기대되잖아 시이이이이이이잉발
1:24 looks like a sephiroth easter egg
Music slaps!
Bro went from Devil Jin to a One-winged Angel
this man jin just had a character revival and became jin kazama uchiha
I NEED THE THEME SONG!
The more and more I see Tekken 8 the excitement gets better with every trailer. Jin go be a problem y'all
His voice kinda different, hope it's still ishin chiba tho
Do Bryan next!
Where is chiba itshin
1:26 bruh that was it?!?! all that build up just for a single punch!!!
jin sounds like eren yeager
He is not even sounded or looked like an emo kid who is depressed anymore. He looked like a hero! A real main character! Damn
Now let’s see Mama Kazama whoop both of them.
What a wonderful family!! They are caring their members really well :D
I hope this drops this yr instead of next 😶
look how they massacred my boy 💔💔💔
In tekken games i consider the announcer to be the real antagonist
The one winged devil.. bad ass
NOOOO WHY DID THEY FUSE MY MAIN AND HIS NORMAL HARDER COUNTERPART AAAAAAAAA
Now we wait to see if Devil Jin is still in. I'd imagine yes.
Wait, did they give him a dragon uppercut @ 1:10? Tear drop..
No mercy for them controllers and joysticks, so much action going on, spamming is gonna be something tough.
In need this ost in my life
So the whole story is that Jin is wearing a wig and is real father is Geese...
when daddy come home with the wrong milk
plz... come out K U N I M I T S !! Please!!! My Girl!!!
not gonna lie it looks with these mechanics like street fighter but the animations are way better.....at least for my eyes...lets see what ed boon will say...sf and tekken will be great fighters...WB puts real junk lately...i really lived mk9 and mkx..even injustice 2 was great until they made a zoning fest out of it...mk11 was crap...even strive is better...and i have high hopes for new soulcalibut game.. S6 is really undarrated gem...
I like this hybrid Jin + Devil Jin moveset.
"Strength isn't everything" After brutallizing his father 😂
Control over the devil gene ??
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
So I guess dvj isn't gonna be playable lol
Muito top! Personagem fantástico!!!
It's amazing how many people are tryingto get likes by posting the same "character development" joke.  You don't get paid, no one is throwing themselves at you,  and your life is not better for stealing a joke and reposting it, trying to be a top comment.  Think for yourself and be original for fucks sake
well devilster is gonna be happy
Not gonna lie I expected that Hot Dog stand to get destroyed during that one combo
Plus besoin de jouer avec devil Jin, ça libéra pour un autre personnage 👍
glad they got rid of the ugly-ass red boots 🙏
looks like he has perfect control of his powers finally so what will devil jin play like or maybe hes no longer a cast member? if not since Kas is obviously boss they should brink his bodyguard back. not that he needs him but as players, we do
I really hope Jin kills Kazuya once and for all, he's the last hope to eliminate the Devil Gene, even if it means sacrificing his own life to do so and exterminate his own Devil Gene.  Also, I thought Jin would transform into Devil Jin like Kazuya transformed into Devil Kazuya, but nope, Devil Jin is going to be a separate character once more.
i don't think there's enough hit effects,  i can still see the characters
Jin actually says dorya in his rage art 1:22
No please I want devil jin to be in this game I wanna hear his crazy laugh
Iam waiting for King's trailer !!...
Jin Kazama finally learns from his mistakes and became a much more better person, his mother Jun would be proud of her son, also He learn to fully control and master the power of the Devil Gene without the fear of losing control or consuming his mind back to his old self once again
Jun?
My favorite Tekken character is arrive eagerly waiting for release Tekken 8
what System ??
He may started World War III but my boi is back!!!! This is that GOOD ASS TEKKEN!
Devil jin is fused with jin its over for dvj mains
🔥🍿
Dayum
Tekken 8😍😍😍
캬 시발
Dayum
HE STOLE ROCK HOWARD'S WIN POSE!
SEN into Divekick?? WTF aha
After being a Jin fan for 20 years I am so proud of this character development. I feel like a proud mother who is rooting for her son ❤
Where’s akuma
PUT BAKI ON THE GAME BRO
HE'S DOING KICK FLIPS THANK YOU TEKKEN TEAM
I hope that the food truck guy gets compensated for the damage.  And yes finally the story continues.
Woah!! Even though Jin is my main character, I've never seen him this OP before. 🔥 The man finally got control of the Devil gene.
Both mishima's lookin fire
My favourite character! My first tekken was the Tekken 3, between all 10 characters, I chose the last one from the character rooster. And it has been my favourite choice through all the years. Love this franchise
5 minutes later . . . "Jin Kazama Movelist Evolution"
I'm calling it now. Jin is going to have an Angel form.
I still hate what they did to him in 6.
Very glad I watched the anime, Tekken Bloodline, because that show brought me back to the Tekken Franchise. Also, so good to have Jin Kazama back to his old self, but new.
Looks too much like Guilty Gear but sounds not so good.
Has Jin Finally reached the ripe old age of 25
1:08 Jin did the mishima dragon uppercut!
STRENGTH ISNT EVERYTHING
That special is so trash 🗑️
CDOTY “Character Development Of The Year”
Looks like they have mixed normal jins fighting style with devil jins
easily the worst trailer so far and NOT the direction most players want to see jin go in. nina and kazuya was dope but this is kinda dumb
1:22 WTF WAS THAT DORYA
Not as powerful as Kazuya's showcase, maybe because it was a blend of Kazama/Mishima styles together.
“I shall not wavu again”
"Strength isn't everything" (proceeds to beat you from 1 side of the map to the other)
honestly seeing jin do a Somersault just doesn't sit well with me!
I shall not waver again 😎
From Power is Everything to Strength isn't everything, can't wait to see the development of Jin and the story as a whole
Man's thinks he's Sephiroth
Woman selling hotdogs just isn't all that bothered that the two biggest war criminals in the world are slamming each other against her stand
เกมต่อสู้สุดมัน🔥
아빠랑 아들 둘 다 ㅈㄴ멋지다
sparks and explosions and janky hit effects everywhere. I rly dislike this tbh. Unfortunately people who want to see the game and not just mash flashy assist combos are the minority.  I can smell strive happening again and the competitive scene being torn.
I still hope devil Jin is a seperate playable character!
You guys should remaster tekken 2
Bellissimo capolavoro non vedo che esce questo gioco su ps5
b f 212 finally in a proper juggle
카즈야 좌종 시계고자
Anyone else catch the suttle DORYA?
Jin's new voices when he attacks reminds me of tekken 3 Jin 🤌
his new voice sounds like sfxt jin va at some points or even t3
You spell sephiroth wrong
One Winged Demon. Jin is a badass.
미춋다
Looks sick! Hyped for Tekken 8 2024 & MK12 this year!
Waiting patiently for Hworang
looks way over the top, everything is so flashy what makes a jab so different from a EWGF? they both glitter like crazy. looks disgusting, i'll watch others play it, wont even bother paying for this garbage
Hi everyone, MainManSwe here
I fucking screamed when Jin said strength isn't everything  Finally my Jin stopped being an emo character
gettin' mad One-Winged Angel vibes as Jin beats his father. Now he has control over his Devil, he's gonna hit harder than ever, harder-still than Kazuya and Jun (let's hope he'll redeem himself to become that Angel)
Moonlight Wilderness V2 when?
the question on true men: who won that fight in the beginning
Jin: "Strength isn't anything." ESports Players: So you have chosen........Death. But seriously Jin coming back and fighting like a hero with a villain inside him is Blastin'.
I started passing about with Jin just before I dropped off with T7, guess I'll be picking up where I left because my god that is the best fucking trailer.
Looks like Jin took a crash course from Marshall Law because now he's fluent in cartwheels 😂
Something isn't quite right...(I know DvJ and Jin are are merged) I juat get the feeling that DvJ is still in the game (with a new form),  but is locked behind certain conditions. Because if you pay close attention he never uses heat AND rage at the same time. Jin even transitions from power stance into an OTGF. This is an indicator that omen stance is returning. So 2 things are plausible. Either classic DvJ is a transformation tied to heat and rage, or to heat rage and power/omen stance. I say this because if you look at the trailer, Jins first encounter (with the white jacket)even though he has control over his devil form still loses against kazuya. Hes left floating at the bottom of some river and Dvj appears to him (but keep in mind he AlREADY had been using his devil powers in the city fight with Kazuya) This mirrors what happened with heihachi and Kazuya in T7. So in short, the first promotional trailer is technically their final fight. Jin will probably go all out and use the full extent of his devil powers and gain a new form to defeat Kazuya.
Sorry jin You Not reached at kazuya level🤫
My boy is back!
"Strength isn't everything"  Jins from Tekken 5-7: u wot m8?
2160p60?? My phone cant handle this sht...
His Voice?!
0:47 Marshall & Forrest Law taught him that. He tried to go to Paul to teach him but ended up breaking his neck
I think there is a mistranslation as he says "Power isn't everything", not "Strength isn't everything".
왕도적인 주인공이 되었군..
Well guys, now Mishima mains won't be able to be like "If you are not playing Mishima; you are not playing Tekken", because this looks easy. Even his f4 CH combo is easy now.
I feel like they're ruining these characters identity, they are stealing move after move from other characters, at this point everyone will be mokujin. I hope I am wrong tho
Damn i gotta learn jin n dj now
that hellsweep oki kinda concern me a bit, that thing leaves you facing up with your head facing them, his hellsweep oki is in par with marduk df1 setup
The game gonna cost 120€ and every season pass 80€ to get the hole roster of characters.
These trailers are doing so much justice, badass how they infused devil jin and Jin into one now. Growth  man I can't wait to see Yoshi! 😭
Jin's grown so much! There was a time when I couldn't stand him. Now I feel like I'm looking at a fully actualized person who has worked through his trials and mistakes to become better. PLUS, this moveset has me thinking about switching mains. lol
Jin rage art is kinda lackluster, and his gameplay is looking weird, Kazuya, Paul and Marshall are looking more polished
It’s gonna take a while for me to get used to the new announcer 😅
literally dropped my jaw
Still the very first trailer is on another level 🔥
YOSHIMITSU WHEN
Damn its going to be tough picking my main fighting games next year....
One winged devil
Still waiting they change the Announcer voice
原田さん。次はアスカとリリ、ぜひお願いします。😂😂😂
Bring back Christie Monteiro please🙏
announcer voice is so cringyyyyyyyyyy :'D but the game looks awesome
This looks like confirmation that Devil Jin isn't a separate character anymore?
Talk about a turning point for Jin, power isn’t everything now… this actually got me hyped to play that story! He looks great overall!   I didn’t think his trailer would compete with his dads but this is awesome actually!
Mispelled "Waiver" in the captions
HEY DEVS! Well... Untill reliese hasn't happened yet... Maybe it isn't too late to decrease the number of that lightnings and splashes that makes new tekken look like street fighter or any other anime garbage?
This is almost perfect, the rage art just need a lil tweeks.
Weak rage art, too much buildup for a meh-feeling punch, gotta make the opponent explode a lot more impactful. Cool otherwise. Also foolishness Jin, foolishness...
so hyped ! and this ost is sick
WTF TEKKEN ITS MIDNIGHT FOR ME, LET ME SLEEP!  (shoutout to asian tekken players)
Só there's no Devil Jin anymore? Jin is fully complete 😁
I hope tekken 8 will come out😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
The way he say tek-ken 8 makes me smile
Naaaah they made announcer so dirty💀 Back in ol days we had amazing announcers like in tekken 6...
1:09 food truck guy😇
i miss old tekken 3 Style without fireballs flyingfire kicks etc. they copy to much from street fighter u push some buttons and than the character make some finish him or super combo in the old tekken u must do every combo byurself and without hokus pokus tricks old Tekken was really hard bone breaker Fighting game not this tutti frutti simsalabin style
What a shitty ca sf6 slams
The animations need a lot of improvement. Like a LOT. Especially when you hit your opponent on to a wall. And when the heat feature is on you can't tell what's happening cause all of the flashes and explosions
Particle Vomit
임펙트 호불호 존나  갈리겠다
We have got the other half to our Namco  Jin tge Bandai
존나 멋있는데 존나 어려울 것 같다...
The hot dog saler: 🗿
I teared up when I saw Hei's db2 as the first ever move in this trailer
Jin have one wing
I liked he’s tekken 7 rage art better then 8
This game might be the reason I get a PS5.
Wasup with all the colorful effects like u can't even see what's going on. The way it was at the 1st reveal jin fighting kazuya is how it should be.
"Mata seta yo da na" is fine, but next I want to hear "Mata seta ne" (But there's more characters to showcase before that, I suppose)  I do notice they're putting in sidesteps even more obviously now, probably because so many people were panicking "zomg no sidesteppu tekken 2d now"
Wait he has akuma aerian kick and heiachi skills is he both student?
OMEN MOD IS RETURN
I had to watch this like 5 times because in kept getting distracted by Leroy in the background :D
Omen Tech. Interesting.
Tekken 8 looks good, but there are 3 things I didn't like too much. Some movements seemed street fighter style (for me, negative), the voice of the new commentator is not as epic as the previous one and do not think they went a little with the lights, lightning and so much effect on screen? it's a tekken, not a DmC, please.
Brooo my man Kaz is getting beat up in front of a food truck. By his son! 😂😂💀
Ma Man!!!! Jin Kazama!!!! HE IS THE ONE!!!! AND HE'S THE HERO!!!
Miguel: Am I a joke to you?  *After seeing his character development*
Game is looking good but I'm not too excited about the announcer. It just sounds too engrishy and ESL, basically someone you'd want to stop listening to after a few seconds. I mean the other guy spoke like a robot but at least he wasn't horrible to the ears.
1:21 DORYA!!
Am I REALLY the only one who doesn't like this changes at all? This is literally not Jin my dear Jin mains
Doesn't look tekken at all sorry to say this look rip of kof street fighter
0:34 I forgive you.
These graphics are lookin better and better everytime a new trailer comes out🔥🔥🔥
Well, RIP Devil Jin.
Badass
what happend to jins devil power..... bro he need more power or he die agains kazuya
He looks amazing 😃😃
that super sucks......
They've turned Jin into a KOF character and I'm absolutely TF here for it. Jin's Karate with the same violent destructive quality as Kazuya's mishima style. Overall, This is the gameplay make over that tekken needed, this Trailer confirms it. Harada has seriously outdone himself somehow.
theres too much effects.. and its not realistic anymore. totally not liking this version of the series
Rip Jojo punches
Is it just me or did he get THICC?
Ehhh Mishima family was always lame. Lee is the best one in the family lol
Lame. This isn't Tekken, this is just a bunch of mess pulled from other games they thought would be cool. Bring back the glory days of Tekken.
That super was kind of weak. But it looks good overall in the game play department.
its good but kazuya’s trailer was better ngl
Oh my God, Jin is just incredible, divine!🔥🔥🔥💞
I feel bad for the hotdog stand
1:21 JIN DOES DORYA!!!!
Can't wait for Dragunov reveal.
Deku: Detroooooiiit SMAAAAAHSHHH  Jin Kazama: Let me old my beer 🍻
Jin finally beat his rival, Kazuya Mishima What is up next for Jin ?
Looks like devil jin is no more but the character development is fascinating
His super sucks compared to Kaz.
So when will Tag Tournament 3 be released?
Coolest kit I ever seen jin have
Let’s goooooooooo
Wtf is this SF looking clone?
Bro wtf just dropping trailers randomly!!
*one winged angel intensifies*
Now, Jin is in control of the devil gene and has a mixture of both movesets. This game is gunna be sick
"noooo you can't just punch fate in the face"  Tekken fans be like: 👊👊👊
I almost cried when he said strength isn’t everything damn Jin you really grew up on us 🥹🥹
1:10 Lady maybe you should GTFO of there.
Trailer mostly look like KOF
Strongest character in the game: Strength isn’t everything.
The Law filps are crazy
It's like he mastered the dark hadou
That flying kick in 0:58 is just crazy. Can't wait to see more characters.
Strenght isnt everything. Man Jin has come along way for those words to finaly come out i'm very exited for teh story an Jin who from the trailer alone has finally found himself after long being lost he broke the chains of self hatred. And his move set are great love the Devil gene being incorporate in his karate style If i'm not wrong theirs some mishima in it to he really is making the bad thing into good thing nice.  Man also got Drip
This Happen when his mother is around XD, now he is a good boi. "Power isnt everything now"
1:13 that combo is so sick 😍
Bring back the old announcer.
0:25- 0:31 Announcer: NEW CHALLENGER!! JIN KAZAMAAAA!!!!!!!!!
I see Lars and Jin may have trained together
LET'S GO!!!
The Jin I've been waiting years for. A combination of Devil Jin with his Karate style moveset. Now it's time to go back to my boy as my main once again.
Honestly not digging the new Announcers voice
Nowhere as cool as Kazuya. It's just a fact
Where's the crazy storm enviroment like in the first teaser?
But this gives me soul calibur hope
The grandson of Heihachi and Kazumi "Hachijo" Mishima, son of Kazuya Mishima (Satan's vessel) and Jun Kazama, and the inheritor of Lucifer's vessel (The Devil Gene) Jin Kazama fight his way to save Earth to defeat his father and end the cycle of the Devil Gene's curse that his grandmother brought before his father. 😎.
Cool, cool, but Kaz is cooler am I right guys?
Looks like I'm learning Jin in Tekken 8
Up4, down2, 3+4 - 3... Jin has the best tools of his devil form and I'm loving it. The hype is real boys!
Well, if I had to guess, devil Jin seems to be gone. Considering his electric hook is replaced with ewgf like every other mishika
1:10 that poor food truck worker. Homie didnt deserve that
Glad to see my main kicking ass once again. Also glad to see him redeem himself.
So he still won't transform in combat after all these years we still can't change in battle great now if I want devil jin I have to use as separate charecter smh
I think they didn't show everything about jin kazama , why he is not transferring as a devil like kazuya?  Or they will show more when the game releases  ? Anyone know ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🥹🥹🥹😭😭😭😭😱😱😱 they did my main character Justice. Now I’m super hype for this game.
Ight jin is hype.
Jin look sick
Rock Howard wants his celebration back. And Kyo his white 99 jacket
Woah he plays like Devil Jin and Lars combined.
No kazuya trailer but still good, just give us the Yujiro Hanma trailer already "Power is everything"
Хаарош) Казуей и Джином продали мне игру))
nice
My fav part is when he said: "You've tekken everything from me, now I'm tekken 8 all back" best character
His face looks very beautiful like in the ending of TK7. I'm glad they fixed Jin and Lars faces. His face now looks very delicate and cuter, I'm happy to see my main looking so pretty
Hwoarang still beat his ass
1:21 That move from Jin was from the Reveal Trailer.
Kazuya better. cry me a river
I like how the food truck vendor just stands there with a poker face while his truck is being destroyed by Kazuya’s body been smacked into it
I like jin's new? Current? Voice actor
Can't wait to get f4'd from Jim mains in t8
He looks awesome. Exited for the game
7 하고 있는데 굳이 구입할 필요성은 못 느끼겠네
Idc about none of these folks all I care about is the gameplay of Mr. Fury
Oh no, I have to learn Jin now.  Whatever shall I do?
Two good
The original jin is embracing the traditional karate, even tho he's ever train mishima's karate by heihachi, he choose not to use it since tekken 4 because he's hate it.  in contrast he's devil counterpart use mishima's karate as symbol of brutality and absolute power that jin could unleashed if he fall into his hatred and intention to kill.  in here we've seen his moveset are combine of the two side of him, as the result of accepting that he is mishima that are violence and lust for power, but not forgetting that he's also kazama like his mom who love peace, caring, and pacifist. plus now he could control he's devil gene.                                                                                     i think he finally managed to defeat his worst enemy which is himself. and that  are an appropriate development for main character.
Finaly Jin dosen't need to close himself.
Rock Howard: Hey! That's *MY* win pose! 1:32
This not tekken is power ranger red wtf
median line destruction looks so fun to use  i cant wait
Where's Mario?
Bamco droppin Trailers and dipping is sending CCs in a frenzy lol
Jesus the effects are just amazing
And lets see what the modders will do
i'm so exited for tekken 8 but my god, these particle effects are so obnoxious
I just hope Bryan is still in Tekken 8 he's been my main since Tekken Tag on PS2
I used to main Jin and dropped him for Lee... If Lee somehow doesn't make it to Tekken 8. I will main Jin again 100%!!
That was one of the most exciting trailers I’ve seen. Jin having mixed Devil Jin moves with his original moves is crazy; luckily he’s able to control his Devil Gene. Heat smash is insane for Jin….this makes me wanna play and learn him all over again.  Hope in the next trailer they show my main character Lars.
With all this firework, you miss on the action
Damn now Jin can do Black Flash too? Monster!
Is that Dios voice actor? WRYYYYY
Yagami Iori....?
This releasing this year?
Is jin still in his early 20s during the events of TK8?
Waiting for king 😺
If you don't afraid spoilers, than someone would throw his family member into volcano. Because it's how family relationships working in this universe, I guess.
Ngl I kinda wish tekken did what MK seemingly is doing where they finish the game then drop it this is killing me seeing all these fire trailers knowing this game ain't coming out anytime soon 😤 😫
Kinda fake now bro barely martial arts anymore
*Strength isn’t everything*  *Proceeds to STRENGTH EVERYTHING*
로우가 왜 여기서나와?
Everything ok  But the stupid gay voice of the anouncer No thanks
I can't wait to see Devil Jin's gameplay trailer, my favorite character
I guess he had some practice with Lars with those flippy dips 😂
Did he just say “DORYA” when he did his rage art 😩
My man channeling his inner Sephiroth
That One Wing appearing on him reminds me like Sephiroth
tekken 7 screw is gone? ;_;
It's a Shame the downgrade but well looks interesting with the new moves ...
This must mean Devin Jin isn’t a playable character anymore😢
For the love of god, don't let that be the announcer
🥹🥹🥹
와우!@!! 개 멋있다 !! ㄷ ㄷ ㄷ
As a long time Jin main, this trailer disappointed me.   d1 now looks like it does wallsplat anymore since there is a follow up animation zen 3+4 knocks down now so you cant use it as a combo filler but an ender LLRK doesnt launch  zen 1,3 now has a grab animation, so this means i cant bring you wall to wall on infinite stage now in combos Rage art doesnt look like it starts on 13 frames anymore  but in the bright side 2,4 transitions into the zen for a mix up after -10 f4 ch knock back was reverted to its old distance omen stance is back aswell but now its actually useful since the cd happens instantly   He looks extremely underwhelming in the trailer, also his animations are far worst that kazuya. sht kaz looks like a fking badass in tekken 8
0:44 Mental Alertness in case anybody missed it. 1:00
Definitely not against the new direction, and I get it's essentially a combo of Jin and D.Jin's movesets, but seeing regular Jin flip around so much just feels so off - specially when you're used to 5 mainline games and 2 tag games of him being a really grounded character.
Jin is hot
His rage art was tame compared to kazuya’s
Jin met Rock Howard and borrowed some style. I like it.
Eliza or Shaheen won't be in the game looks like it and it looks like Jin and Lars have allied and Lars has taught him some of his moves. Jin has Eliza's signature divekick, and Shaheen's I think f,f+4
My favorite character of Tekken😌❤️
i love how character development for jin is literally 1 sentence change from "power is everything" to "power isnt everything" thats all the tekken fans wanted.
I like those power crunch sounds on Jins moves.
The merger of his Devil Jin and regular Jin moveset is amazing. Might be a Jin main
At 0:40 Jins eye glows red too
I'm ready for my main, KING!
I can't believe we're FINALLY back to real Jin instead of the impostor we've had since T6 days 🥲
1:08 First day part time at Food truck store 🤕🤕🤕
Looking very Lars with those new kicks
Xiaoyu would be proud of this Jin 🥲
"One Winged Devil"
눈뽕만 조금 빼자. 이게 격투게임이냐 호그와트 철권이냐 뭔 파티클이 이렇게 난잡해
ㅅㅂ! 나 군대가기 싫어!!ㅠㅠ
Hype!!!!
so fighting games are the leaders of pushing graphical prowess in gaming these days? bet! can’t wait for this game.
Hope yaw brought replays back🥱
I like how they made him somewhat of a heroic version of the one winged angel and plus the new moveset 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦅
They gave him a backflip damn
Jin being a hero again after he fucked up in Tekken 6
"Strength isn't everything" this isnt jin, this is jim
This is bored. play Lars
DOPE!
Devil Jin moves included. Improved dialogue and voice. More fluid movement. Character development. 👏🏾 👏🏾
1:22  He really said. "DORYA!!!!"  Godlike trailer from the man himself. These trailers are absolute bombs!!!
I’ll get you
YEAH BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY
He looks and moves like Noctis now, sadge
LARS NEXT PREASE
I'm just waiting to see what abomination Yoshimitsu has become this time
1:35 ‘I shall not wavu again.’ *wavus*
My man, my son's name my favorite character and idol since puberty never let's me down. What hero 🙌🙏
Also throughout this epic jin kazama gameplay. I admire the strength of that hotdog truck taking all the damage and staying strong while these 2 are fighting to the death.🤩🤩😏
Those hits look like they hurt
I see Jin is getting his revenge on Kazuya for that last gameplay trailer.
Ok so they just gave him Eliza’s cheapest moves…cool.
Great video, but please change the guy that shouts the names.
OMEN STANCE IS BACK!!!
The "Strength isn't everything" line I suspect will tie into Jin failing to beat Kazuya using his Devil Gene power (going by the story trailer). Thats when Jun will step in to purge the Devil Gene from him and possibly retrain him in the Kazama style/power.
I'm just waiting for Jun
Jin Copied Lars real quick
Imagine being that hotdog vendor and seeing a dude get bodied repeatedly into your truck. Dude has inhuman balance to not move while his truck is getting rocked like that though.
Hope Angel merges with him or Jun
KAZUYA - 0.43 SEC - GRRRRR!! BOW BOW!!
0:32 *Jin on a whole new level.* 1:21
"Strength isn't everything. The power of the devil and the ability to fly also matter." - Jin Kazama
Like v below if your a jin main v 😲
Jin and Devil Jin being fused rumors debunked, Devil Jin is also confirmed here.
CONFIDENT JIN IS <3
That person on the hotdog stand at 1:07 just vibin while the hotdog stand gets pummeled by Kazuya's lifeless body.
Announcer is bad
Looking amazing! The fighting games are going IN!!!! Love it!
wow so amazing
It's funny that Jin never tried to get control over the Devil gene, and in this game he's suddenly a master. Still, pretty cool evolution of the character.
I'm not liking this... looks like an L for Kazuya
Damn. Jin also went into a Sasuke Arc that power isn't everything.
This Narrator is always getting on my nerves 😤
LMAO HE HAS DRAGUNOV D2!!!
I FUCKING KNEW HE WAS NEXT
Everyone talking about "strength isn't everything" and I'm here wondering; did they change his Voice Actor? C'mon I'm asking the real question here.
Can we transform into the Devil jin
He looks fun but I'm sorry he is so uncool lol. Just my opinion.
Cadê o hwoarang harada
I guess this means that Devil Jin won't be his own character. I am loving all these updated movelist for all the legacy characters it, older players are learning along side new players and keeps things interesting for them too.
Looks cringy with these flips, kazuya gameplay way better
My boy looking not like a snack but a damn six course meal.
jin parry kazama:-iam virgin iam virgin iam virgin iam virgin iam virgin, parry,parry fre launch... 👎👎
Ok Rock Howard.
Can we have Lars gameplay please?
Corn Dog Guy be like.. “This is never gunna buff out!”
nice fix i love this jin v2
Rage is ok could have done better but other stuff is just epic!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bacanudo
Will this be the Final Tekken?
I'm finally warming up to the look of this. But it's still far too many particle effects.
best tekken ever🎉❤
POV : NO CHILD SUPPORT
THE HOTDOG TRUCK SHAKES ON CONTACT
meu Jin Kazama está incrível nesse Tekken 8 meu deus tantos combos ótimos...
Person on hotdog truck : "this is fine... "
I hope we get Bruce Irvin back
Dragunov's d+2 at Jin is interesting
Jin Kazama in Tekken 7: Power is everything. Jin Kazama in Tekken 8: Strength isn't everything. 🔥🔥
Strength isn't everything now.. Hmm
Paul and law probably will get their trailer with new animation movements.
Oh thank god I hope this means no more Devil Jin has his own character slot
Yo, did they fuse his old and “new” move sets? That’s fucking rad.
It's gonna be interesting to see what ends up playing better between T8 or SF6. I haven't gotten into any fighting games since GG:strive in its first year. My fingers are ready for the pain.
"Strength isn't everything". After reading the comments, I'm glad I'm not the only one who caught on to the character development 🔥
LETS GOOOOOOO
“Strength isn’t Everything”  FINALLY. Jin decides to control his inner devil literally and take on Kazuya to atone for his failed plan and setting the world into war and chaos during Tekken 6. Character development indeed - and using the Evil Omen moves too!
Jin lost his identity on this one, but I had to admit that his moves are Eye candy!
Rip playable dj
"Strength isn't everything"  Ironic that he is at his strongest.  Goes to show that to say such words mean that you reached the point of being at that strength  (Wish they updated his rage art tho. Esp after that sick Kazuya RA)
HYYPPEEPPEOEOOEE
That hot dog is still at 2006
what is it with these random trailers not complaining tho
I find it interesting that both Ryu and Jin seem to have reached a level of mastery around the same time. I also think it's cool that they both don't have a crazy anime style super/rageart. Just a really powerful strike for the most part.
Who else is hyped af for Tekken 8!!
Incroyable
Wow just wow
Epic
I would like to see Kiryu/Majima in this game .
전부 기캐릭화인가?
>Good Jin is back (T4 and prior) HEEEELLLL YEEEAAAAHH
Strength isn't everything but his drip and new moves is,  and I really hope we still see devil jin and heihachi even if I don't play them
This merge of Jin and Devil Jin looks so cool, looks like I saw DJ's hell sweep and his while rising 2
He thinks he’s rock howard now with the wings and biker jacket 🤔😅
Let's go
Guy Kazama when
1:06 is that Andrew tate on the left?
Bring back akuma
now that jin is humble again,  i really hope they put back that win pose "forgive me" back from tekken 5.  I really liked that win pose.
HYPE
He went from Power is everything to Strength isn’t everything we got a true mindset change with jin
Seems like we are going to have a lot more content from Devilster when Tekken 8 comes out...great aesthetic and gameplay on the first look...hyped
CALM DOWN DEVILSTER
My god..
wow !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The kazuya look revamp can’t be best ngl
My main is back
Nicely done, Bandai. Jin looks amazing!!!
Likeable Jin? Sign me up!
Durya!
I used play tekken 3 and 6 when i was a kid. We all grow real fast ...
1:10 hot dog trailer holding Jin power
The only Tekken games I have played are one of the earlier ones that included Eddy and one that was on the gameboy advance back in my childhood. After watching a lore video and listening to some Tekken music, I am excited to jump back into Tekken after all these years and get back into playing fighting games in general again.
For the love of everything, can someone please tell me the soundtrack
Awesome!!!
What a way to end the month. Thank you for another exciting giveaway, Bandai Namco
one winged angel lookin ahh
The Hotdog vendor just standing there watching as two foreigners with wings sprouting from their backs are beating each other up 😂😂😂
😎
Lars (🦁) Alexandersson next pls. . .
Somehow they managed to make Jin even cooler.
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING We got our Tekken 3 Jin back guys
"Strength isn't everything." Sounds like he might be smiliar to the Jin in Tekken Bloodline, I love that!!
oh my god he has full mastery over the devil gene
So glad I woke up early
For those who are Super Sentai fans, the announcer is the voice the Zenkaigers' changers. So much hype in his call outs for the characters. Hell this trailer might make me a Mishima player.....not really but still awesome
My man! Jin! He’s been my main since T3. Glad to see him kicking ass again.
Can’t wait to wear my tekken 4 Jin outfit
Please show us YOSHIMITSU ALREADY:(
Is it jin kazama or sephiroth?🤣🤣🤣
It looks goofy. I wish more mature Tekken. Now it looks like a fashion show ( I also hate stupid caps and cloth additions in the previous tekken) . Interactions between characters and environment look awful  (1:08 look at the hot dog van). The character is charging like in street fighter or dragon ball - this looks just silly (do you remember how Paul was charging his hits in T3? Without this cringe?). Walls and ground are just exploding with huge pieces when touched.  Ridicule.
Wow. Power is Everything to Strength isn’t Everything. Mix of DVJ and Heihachis move set. Looks insane
His super is kinda trash compared to Kazuya
That Ragna win pose tho.
Damn can’t wait when is this game released
Omg his awesome
Omfgggggg i'm exploding 🤯🤯🤯 Every week they Show us a New character. Harada you are crazyy!!!!!
damn look at the quality of the npc, absurd!!!!!
Jin seems more acrobatic now. I also love how he's wearing more white than black now.
Does devil jin character gone?
Jin really is the Sasuke of tekken
finally, jin isnt the same WHINY EDGE BOY. now hes an EDGE MAN
The Announcer Hits Different Doe
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH🗣💯 JIN MY BOI😭♥️ look at him changing his ways🥹
WTF NEW CHALENGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Beautiful game. This is what Tekken 7 should of looked. I don't know what Capcom done with Street Fighter but it looks hideous.
Hope there is an option to either greatly lower or turn off all of those spark/hit effects. From an accessibility point of view it border line looks like a seizure fest disaster waiting to happen.
Bruh, what about devil Jhin mains T.T
0:54 Bandai namco take the Glock fire sound from cs 1.6 to put in game
New moves to memorize, love it!
I like how his fighting style is reflecting how he's controlling the devil gene
Jin for now can control power of Devil Gene.
dayum the movements so beautiful with new stance
Jin and kratos the character development from them both 😌🤟
“Strength isn’t everything” Good guy Jin is back after Tekken 6 made edgy to “save the world” Feels good to have Tekken 3-5 Jin Kazama with his 2 styles combined
Jin became mature..
Damn new Devil Jin nerf hit him so hard that he's not in the new game.
Damn that move set is very brutal.
I like that they seem to remove Devil Jin. Lets be honest everyone liked Kazuya more, DJ was just always the stronger character.
"Strength isn't everything" Jin has really grown.
Pleasy give us the King trailer with Armor King as opponent🙏
"Strength isn't everything."  Foolishness, Jin. Foolishness.
T8 and SF6 are both looking great. The peak FGC will return!
jin looking crazy
Yoooo the drippiest Jin, and solid looking moves incorporating his Devil powers (What will happen to DVJ as a character, tho 🥺)  Really hyped to this game.   From "Power is Everything" to "Strength isn't Everything" is just something else
Man Jin character development from edgelord karate kid, to a edgelord but wiser and guided
0:52 oh my goodness, it’s a character development
Loved that "Strengh isn't everything" line... also, that glow on his eyes intrigues me
Rock Howard ending pose there?
Finger's crossed I just hope Akuma or Ryu will make an appearance. I feel like someone helped Jin control his power. And I bet it's Ryu helping him reach out for his mom. *Even though it'll never happen. Lol.*
He finally found his way.  My man was misguided but now he'll guide anyone to their graves should they meet his fist.
This Jin definitely saw his mother, look how confident he acts now. Looks like he finally found himself
Jin is here to tekken 8
I'm loving the aggression with this game so far! Can't wait to see my boy King! 🙌🏾😤
Jin at his utmost prime. Pure control and confidence. Love the mix of Devil Jin moveset into his own, and the return of Omen! This game is looking so damn good.
I only saw 3 devil Jin moves similar to of Tekken 7  Dragon upper cut  Last hit of brimstone strike  Malicious mace  Is this end of devil Jin 😭
No more devil jin 🤨
the subtle references to jun kazama's fighting style is a nice addition, finally feels like jin has come full circle
Kazuya's one weakness.......is a hotdog stand
"Strength isn't everything" Yes bro, frames matter.
Let's gooooooooo
HOLLYYYYYYYYY SSSHHHHIIIIIII!!!
Strength isn't everything, but that sweet soundtrack is. I've been waiting years for Tekken to get back to trance osts.
I think jin just made me buy this game
One thing i noticed in all tekken games since tekken 3. That Jin is aged from a teenager into a fully grown man. It's beautiful and heartwarming.
Awesome
“Strength isn’t everything”  MA Boi Jin from tekken 5 is finally home 😭
Hey Bandai, what do I need to do to be a DLC character in your game?
YOOOO WHY SO SUDDEN, really caught me off guard
"Strength isn't everything" hits so different with Jin.
i really hope Jin is keeping his iconic ewgf voiceline from tekken 4-7, but i can't wait for this game!
The visual effects are too much. WTF is this Namco?😒
So he can control his devil now which means no more DVJ? 😢
I did not like new announcer first. But its not so bad i guess.
0:54 so Jin finally open his eyes that power isn’t everything huh? Boy Jin never disappoints me
Please let us unlock them like in Tekken 2 please.
Very cool moves Jim Pajama.
Jin kazama aka mama's boy
The Protagonist has arrived!!!
They should hold down the flashing light's or there will be complaints of others getting seizure like what happened with Balan Wonderworld
When  Tekken evolved enough to use THE WORLD TIME SKIP SOUND. this trailer made my Myers tier level got to 200 now.
The boy who lost his mother as a teenager, his father, and got betrayed from his Grandfather, Jin Kazama is determined to redeem himself on saving the world from evil domination!
I like where this is going so far, and the character development is big! I can’t wait to use some of these combos online!
after meet his mother, jin became good boy again
I play Jim - Mexican kid at super arcade
The sound effects for the attacks ☄️☄️☄️
Does this mean next week we will see Jun? Oooh I hope so.
That cool looking, lively stage. Wonder how much they are going to charge for that stage.
Guy manning the hotdog stand probably second guessing his career choice
They done turned Jin almost into a Shoto character
Jin went on a spiritual journey with all that time he was knocked out in tekken 7
Love it! Keep it going Namco!!!
1:12 that combo looks too sick!!!
BEYOND HYPED
Welp.. Pour one out for Devil Jin
🤤🤤🤤🤤
Looks cheap compared to sf6
Jin is my main character. Always has been. Always will be.  So happy they kept Kazama style turning leg strike.   Also, that flip kick he does, isn't that the move his mother taught him in the tekken anime?
Love the music !
Can't wait to see the brand new characters, keep the trailers coming!
tekken 7 : the power is everthing!  tekken 8 : the strength isn't everythig.  and Kazama jujitsu style x Traditionnal Karate style ?!
자기가 김시온이면 개추
I really like his new "shouting" mid combos. Gives a sense of effort.
I like how Hotdog man standing there like nothing happen
Nah, I'm not feeling Jin's new animations. He had a hard hitting, solid and grounded style. This is like he's been spending too much time with Lars.
His moves look similar to Lars's moves. Did they remove his Rage drive from T7? I hope they didn't.
nice
this is setting up to be year of the the FGC. all the heavyweights are coming for the crown
Jin got an advanced form of Omen back!!!  This is amazing!!💪🏾🔥⚡
1:06 dude in the stall: "can you not?"
Bruh these next few years are gonna be the years of the fighting games. So many great releases in a short span of time
Jin Kazama accepts his unwanted power while maintaining his humanity. Can't wait to use him.
This comments section can't be serious. It looks like Jin is a different character. This game is gonna be so much worse than 7. Guess I'll just play Tag 2 until T9 or TTT3 comes out 😕
I think I like Jin better now
It is soooooooo cooooooool to thave PRIDE FC announcer voice on the game. I would love to see more references, and when i say references i say PUT MIRKO, NOGUEIRA AND FEDOR IN THE GAME!!
Yes yes yesssss
All time my favourite game from my childhood like I was use to play tekken 2 😂
So, Jin is combining both his Kyokushin Karate and the Mishima Ryu style along with controlling the devil gene.   "Strength isn't everything."  Plus he's... Confident now. I'm looking forward to maining him again for the final battle.
both Jin and Kazuya wear Drips! Goku has some new Competition(s)
Beautiful
I like his outfit it looks clean!🔥
ill just say it here!! im a game designer and im not that impressed with tekkens designs anymore!!! The maps seems not good enough !! even i can design better maps and i have!!! by myself for free!! im actually one of the hidden goats whos about to  release legendary content!!!! imo opinion , tekken stages needs to be transitional and more interactive At this point!!! for instance, you should be about to fight on a moving bus, pop into one of the windows of the bus and transition into the bus fighting with people holding their heads moving out the way then the buss crashes because of the fight and the scene transitions into the street's of a REALLY nice map and things like that need to happen!! with all the money they have. what their giving us is weak imo!!!!! they should prob hire me im the one!!!!! at 32 years of age i have convinced myself im the one! ill prove it when i release after all these years of development! yearsss by myself , YEARSS , non the less i will be playing tekken 8 im a law main!!!!!  But soon you will all know me as Silent Shadow!!!!!!!! Game MASTER
Devilster my man where are you !!!
Did jin take some moves from devil jin?
Tekken 8 looks just as colorful as Street Fighter 6.
downgrade?
Man… what the hell is going on
um can i run this game on pantium 4
No more DJ i guess
Is it me or are these hit effects a little too overbearing? Like at points it kinda obscures whats going on. Hopefully in actual gameplay it will be fine.
Jin has angel power from his mother, devil power from his father, super human power from his grandfather, and his own skill as an martial artist.
T8 Jin is making T7 Lars  moveset look outdated.
No longer an emo. Good. New voice, new mindset, able to control the devil gene. Doing well.
Loving how super infused the moves are with the characters. It looks like Jin has adapted a few of his devil mechanics into his arsenal.
The main character that's from Urban Reigns should be added on Tekken, doubt it'll happen really but I just wanted to let it out 🤷
"theres no side steps omg" lmao tekken fans really are the worst
FUCKING AWESOME
Can't wait for the Jun reveal
Very impressive with the unwavering hotdog stand
Wow Jin mains are eating lately
1:09 Look how calm the lady in the hot dog stand is when two brawls are beating her business down
helomaimanswehereihopeyouaregoodasalways
We need Jun reveal next 👼
Jin main here Excited But it feels like graphics got really worst
Yo at this point will we even have Jin on T9 or just devil Jin🔥🔥🔥🥰
is this really tekken 8?  looks almost identical to me ....
Pretty sure we won't get Devil Jin as a character and they blended the 2 characters into 1
0:55 💪🤢
Jin Swagama
1:34 "I shall not waver again" Its clear that Jun changed him
Bandai namco is leaving no stone unturned
*Can't wait to see Bryan*
Jin looking like a mix of Devil Jin / Jin in the play style
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I am kinda curious if they would add rocky or creed in a Tekken Game
looks amazing
He did the Rock Howard pose, nice
Bro the new Moveset looks sick !
Heihachi: I wonder if they ever miss me? Comments section: Look at that combo by Jin. This game is gonna be epic Heihachi: 😭😭😭 if it wasn't for me there would be no tekken. Y'all can't even riot so that they bring me back?
I’m still waiting for ridge racer
Mast
Jin now embracing his Kazuya lineage with the moves and the 1:21 DURYAAA!
i hope we wont be facing anymore buffing and nerfing with this game 🤔🤷‍♂️
No devil Jin ?
Man anybody knows the release  date ?
Glad to see my Jin mains happy Having said that, the amount of partical effects on screen  might overshadow the actual gameplay  But we'll have to wait and see how the actual user experience might be
That hot dog vendor has nerves of steel
1:09 just another day for the hot dog vendor
Jin looks like he got some lessons from Lars.
Is that Dragunov's d2 and wr 3?
Look at my boy go!!!! 😄
I really don't like the new exaggerated movesets.
Say goodbye to the devil Jin, one of the most played character 🤣🤣🤣
🥵🥵🥵
Jin seems very dope by itself! Hyped to see Devil Jin!
Fighting Game fans just winning right now.
It is great trying new things.. But for me i hated this gameplay style. Too much going on.. Too many new features. Game doesnt feel like a arcade fighting anymore it is more like an action game. I will no buy it until i see a gameplay from one of my fav players. Probably will continue to Tekken 7 with my pals after that lol. I play tekken since tekken 3. Tekken 8 is the one i felt least excited about unfortunately.. I was so hyped when i heard it was coming and what i see is not a thing i like. I hope franchise will not get affected badly.
This could just be because they were shown already but I hope we're getting a new character trailer every week like KoF15 did
It would be great if this gama had QTE or some other mini games
Gonna need more than just gameplay to compete with SF6
STRENGTH ISN'T EVERYTHING!!! MY MAIN LOOKS GODLIKE!!
Graphic is downgrade
I love this announcer so much.
They did my favorite warrior of the iron fist absolute justice
My fav character. Great moveset, nice design, but cmon now, wtf was that lame ass rage art. Jin is the main character, he is the edge that is approaching, HE IS HIM. And u are going to do my boi dirty like that? Jin needs the most edgy/epic ultimate ever.
NEW CHALLENGER
I'm so early
0:54
camera moves a lot
Can we change the announcer voice?
The downgrade compared to the first trailer☠️☠️☠️☠️
That hot dog vendor's got nerves of steel.
JIN MAINS, WHERE ARE YOU AT. ITS TIME WE RISE 💪😎
Bro got insane character development let's goooooo
Is the voice actor still the same??
Okay, I've never played Jin enough since Tekken 4 to know what the hell is going on, but I can tell he changed quite a lot from T7 and I'm LOVING it!
I bet Hwoarang will have Baek's moves in there now.
Wow. “Strength is not everything” Character development right there    AND DID I HEAR HIM SCREAM DURYA!!?
So king next?
What’s up guys, MainManSwe here.. 😂
😤⚡💪
This Jin reminds me of Tekken 3’s Jin, a positive one and confident.
Dang, plenty of DVJ implemented in Jin's kit now!  OMEN STANCE IS BACK!?
Jin looks crazy 🔥🔥
The rage art kinda killed it. i hope they improve it
U hope they tone down flashy effects.... from  Yakuza lol
From "Power is everything" to "Strength isnt everything" Wow look how jin has come a long way now thats what i called character development.
I CAME
That street seller just chilling in the car while Kazuya got bumped into it lmao
Make way Sephiroth, Jin is new one winged angel
So hyped for Jin Alexandersson
Genocide Jin finally gone
HooLeeSheet Hype i hope the do Lee justice
ONE TRAILER PER WEEK??? I HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO EVERY WEEK THEN, NICE
Jin got drag D2 😂😂 0:32 I guess he had no good lows they had to give him one of the best tools 😂  And in min 1:04 he got cloudios mid high as a mid mid 😂😂 Okie I guess Jin ganna be a DLC character in T8   At least 24 doesn't knock down, has stance extension now 😂😂😂😂😂 min 0:41  So he has access to 50/50 when ur minus 10 😂
what's up guys, MainManSwe here, hoping you're all doing awesome as always
To much stupid effects, looks like crap
I really don't like the new announcer. It's just not the same. I can't be the only one.
any release date confirmation???
Never got into this franchise and still can't. It's just not for me or my style.
He can finally control the Devil Gene within him.🦾
kind of fucking flames
I think he's using a mixture of mishima style karate plus Devil Jin’s moves
THEY RETURNED THE OMEN STANCE!!!!!!
Look how similar his and Kazuyas combos are. This is worrisome.
Heaven wont have him Hellis too scared Jins is gonna take over❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
0:52 looks like somebody grew up
Jin's reveal trailer had blown out my expectations. He has incorporated his Devil form movesets into his Karate style, new quotes and new grunts! Looks like the Tekken dev team are working very seriously to build this game!
As a Jin main, I’m all here for this.
Finally *the unification*
With that trailer, I don't think Devil Jin is gonna be playable. He's literally got DVJ moves integrated into him - even omen thunder godfist.
My body wasn’t ready for Jin OMG Tekken 8 Jin 😩♥️♥️♥️♥️
Rage Art? Meh.
That hotdog stand is even tougher than the ground.
HYPEEEE
*Jin:* "Don't let the last trailer fool you, Dad, I'm the protagonist here. Time to refresh your memory."        "Strenght isn't everything" Ayo!!!
Love it! Can't wait for this game to come out. Can we get a Yoshimitsu reveal please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 👀
@tekken can you please add Nero from Devil May Cry 4 or 5?
I'm sad that tekken 8 comes out. I won't be able to get it cuz I'm from Russia and even if I do my pc will probably not handle it. when tekken 8 comes out pretty sure 7 online will decrease a lot, if not gone completely, and I will be playing tekken 7 alone.
Apparently, Jin is a now a hybrid of human and devil.  His command lists seem a bit a lot than T7. 😅
I wating devil jin 😭😭😭
1:06 Hot dog stand lady just shaking her head... 😂
Jin would kill Kazuya to bring an end to his father's delusions of grandeur?
BAKI in tekken 8 please!!!
Heihachi might not return
Tekken has gone full anime. Tekken isn't Tekken anymore.
Man......This is what you call shattering expectations.
I love wit they did wit jin character design
*I'M NOT GONNA SUGARCOAT IT!!!* ➡⭐⬇↘🟡
가슴이 웅장해지네..
Rock howard-ish win pose! Let's gooooo
Jin aesthetic with his black wings sprouting during fight remind me of God Eater Devour attack, especially the ones in GE3 but that victory pose remind me of Ragna the Bloodege (RIP) victory pose, NGL.
"Strength isn't Everything"  My boy finally grown I'm so proud 🤧🤧🤧
i love the character growth, from "strength is everything" in tekken 7 to "strength isn't everything"
LETS GOOOOOOO
Holy hell, this fusion of Jin + Devil Jin looks absolutely awesome. I really can't wait to try him out!
Next Lei and Zafina gameplay, please. 😊
Wait a second... 1:09 - Power Stance into Dragon Uppercut? YEEEEEEEEEEEESS!!!!!!!!!
Bro this God like. I think devil Jin is gone sadly
Juuuuuun Kazaaaamaaaaaa! Ah no, that's only Jin. Alright, I will wait
Gotta have at least one parry in there. Game looks amazing
Cant wait to see what Yoshimitsu looks like
the devil geneussy in full potency
Why kazuya and Jin has dragunov moves? The first move is basically d2..
I’m loving this
Jin new moves look crazy good. The Devil gene plus the kazama style is dope afff. The rage art could of added a combo of something to it tho.
His rage art needs to end more explosive like kazuya
Combining Jin and Devil Jin moves is genius
1:09 she doesnt even flinch. Hot Dog lady top tier??
pls dont remove devil jin as playable character,this trailer looks like theyre not going to include him in the main roster
His rage art still looks like it lacks impact imo but that aside this is lookin cuhlean
I really like this direction of Jin as a character. He's still emo but he's trying to be a hero. He's using his devil powers to incorporate some of the Misihima moves into his moveset. And his hoodie is better than it was in 7
He looks way more anime in 8 than in 7, fitting that he just straight up stole a move from Lars, the most anime character of Tekken
Jin is fine af 🥵
Yeah... honestly not very happy about this Jin trailer. The animation blending is very rough, reminds me of early Lei stuff like back in T2 how some anims cut into one another. Plus half the moves just don't fit jin. He never did crazy acrobatic maven/kuni type moves and now he got lars' SEN 2 low and a maven 1,1,4 lookalike? Sheesh..
Can't wait for the Edward gameplay trailer. You've put him in the game, haven't you Harada?
T6: “Power is Everything.”  T7: “Strength isn’t everything”   WHAAAAAAAT!? YOOOOOOO! CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT!!!! PEAK!!!
Damn, Jin looks more cool now.
I didn't see him parry anything.
He's turning into Sephy
Food truck guy casually standing there enjoying the show lol
Jin's redemption arc is looking good.
JIM KAZAMA
It looks like Jin has taken most of the moves from devil Jin, that must mean devil Jin must an entire new palette of movesets and combos to play with. Not 100% on that tho
While this looks cool and all... am I the only one bothered by the hot dog stand not taking any damage?XD Like with all those hits, it should do far more than just shake.
Jin Is Waaaay Different this time
Please Xiaoyu next!!!
lol the stone cold face of the hot dog stall owner 😬
Jin thinks he is Rock Howard.
so jin somehow managed to find his inner sephiroth
I want to see Arsenalty reaction to this
Oh hell yeah! He finally has the control of the devil gene! And so far every Tuesday, every trailer hits harder after three of them revealed themselves!
this makes me hopeful for devil jin as playable
TEKKEN, VEM NO COLO DO PAAAAAAAAAAI
WHO IS THIS GUY ?! JIN 3.0
1:36 When dad breaks out the belt
Yoshimitsu when?
Ohoho my boy looking awesome.  Love that he's using some Devil Jin moves in his moveset now.
xiaoyu next
Awesome animations . This tekken looks amazing.
Great. Now I expect Rock Howard to be a guest star.
Ayya ayya kutta ramp ayya 🌚🔥💥
Hurg.... The eletronic music... So loud and annoying... Tekken soundtrack gets worse every new entry
that katarina lookin backflip thing connected to his 1,2 doesn't look very jin to me
Orewa subete owaraseru
Very good, but I don't like the way Tekken is going for.   Because, we have know too much explosion effects, too much fighting style that remembers street fighter.    I like Jin with basic punches and kicks, but without exaggerated effects.
jin mains creaming in their pants rn
I REALLY hope there will be an announcer mod since day 1. New announcer is goddamn awful
I love his new personality. No more queit Kazama with a low voice and no confidence.  THIS IS AMAZING!
Soon as i saw his one wing i immediately thought- S E P H I R O T H
'Mezamero, Kazama Jin!... '
I do not and I repeat do not like the announcer for these last two trailers
와.........진 폼 미쳤다
Next King
Seems like he's grown wiser and mastered his dark side.
Jin mastered the Devil Gene! YES! CAN'T WAIT!
Does this mean Jin’s gained control over the Devil gene?
Whoa he looks SO different!
So no more Devil Jin huh... Guess the boy has become a man. 🔥🔥🔥😎😎... Can't wait!!
아빠킹 반응 마렵네
Awful 🤣😂🤢🤮💩 Overrated juggling simulator that is horrible in literally every single aspect, even the skin textures are bad, you can't make fighting games at all lazy 🤡s
One of my mains, Jin Kazama it's Amazing... ☯️✌️👌
"I shall not waver again" Damn straight you won't
i wanna see what yoshimitsu look like
Casuals are eating it up but there's no way they release this with all those blinding particles on every hit
I guess 8 will be Jin redemption story after the fall out of 6.
It’s a mixture of being happy seeing gameplay but wishing that they took Sf6’s approach with showing new characters to the series rather than the usual suspects we’re used to seeing.
"Strength isn't everything"   not gonna lie... That's a nice touch for his character development 😏👍
I love how the food truck lady seems unphased, like she's used to it
Does this mean the end of Devil Jin? Because this looks like the most Hybrid version of Jin mixing with his style and Mishima style.
tekken 8😳😳😳 just simply wow
So jin now has a akumas dive kick and guiles flash kick?
Is his nose bigger or am I just imagining that?
Ey yo! Is this announcer the one you will use in the game?
cant wait for my boy armor king and king to appear
My favorite character finally here! Jim
Jin went from "Power is everything" in Tekken 6 to "Strength isnt everything" in Tekken 8 real quick
YESSSSS!! About to shed a tear for my boi Jin, look at how far hes come. can use the devil gene now without succumbing. My BOI since Tekken 3
The redemption arc truly has begun.
everyone : daym tekken 8  is so cool, Jin looks awesome me : the hotdog guy doesnt give a damn.... LOL 1:05
With these hopefully we can finally have a proper Jins on Tekken, this one gives me hope that he can finally be a ONE true character fused with his Devil Jin and not as separate units of the same character!!  The movesets of the Devil Jin can be easily transform it into The Devil itself, along with his other, Arc Angel if ever!!
No Devil Jin anymore? :'v
Jin is looking cooler than ever in this trailer. This game will be amazing
He's like Gohan rejecting to go full super saiyan
So this is very intrestsing, he has new moves but it looks like his moves has also been combined with devil jins. He did the uppercut, the down forward 3,1,4 (I think that's the command) and that low in the beginning of his showcase was a devil jin low. So I'm assuming devil jin may not be a thing anymore and honestly that might be for the best for the story sake, either way this is a fire trailer for jin.
weird that namco is releasing an SF6 mod.
Let's gooo
"Strength *ISN'T* everything"  Okay, that's it. Jin is in a turning point!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@devilster will really like this
That character development and that Kyo Kusanagi drip ! WE LOVE IT
Why does jins move looks like KYO kusanagi’s? What the hell happened to tekken. 🥵
This looks like a trash 2d game.....
They connected some of Jin's moves to zen stance. REALLY excited to learn his move set.
So Jin and Ryu just  out here conquering their demons wholeheartedly huh lol amazing trailer.
It definitely feels like Devil Jin's moveset is being transferred into Jin's style now. Looks pretty cool.
1:32 Jin took notes from Rock Howard!
KAZAMA JIN
Every punch Jin deals, it feels like you’ve been hit by several bullet trains
way too powerfull tsk tsk...nope....
Is this the New Tekken 1 again??  ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
I'll miss Devil Jin, but Kazuya looks to be THE Mishima so I ain't complaining
AGGRESSIVE!!!!!!! WOOOOOO!!!!
Sooo is DVJ gone now? Or DLC?
Wow! 😮 Between this and SF6 we good
Please Leroy and Kunimtsu in Tekken 8.
bro the first low attack omg
This is going to be LEGENDARY.
Hell Yeah! So HYPED for *Tekken 8* soon this year! Can't wait for the Epic Badass Story Mode, and the Dynamic Badass Battle Between Jin and Kazuya! I've also wanted to see Jun in this game too! 😀😃😄😁👍👌🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤜🤛
Do Paul or King next
"sorry to keep you keep you waiting" i see what yall did there
Looks amazing, glad we're getting seperate character trailers.
After watching Tekken Bloodline, i’m more hyped for this game
Now this is what I call a trailer of a powerful video game character that’s ready to fight a good fight and win at all cost. Jin Kazama is one heck of a character that could dominate the competition without even trying to. Great work Bandai Namco.
Everyone, no matter what he did, Jin Kazama will always be my main lightning fighter.
1:07 he just wanna sell some hot dogs
Not too sure about these new somersault kicks 🤣 reminds me of Johnny cage with wings
I wish you bandai namco still add yoshimitsu i want him to be in tekken 8 pls add him 😊 if bandai namco read this pls add me in the game
So sick can't wait
YESSS I GOT FREE PUMP FOR GYM NOW LETS GO MY BOY JIN
damn jin's new 3,1 zen into 4 has the 3+4 move ender also wtf?
Tekken fan in 2022: I hate flashy anime effects Tekken fan in 2023: Harada, moar! Make me epileptic!
*_The real One Winged Angel, or should I say Devil?_*
MY FAVORITE TEKKEN CHARACTER IS HERE!
I'm sort of disappointed how his fighting style seems to move further away from the Kyokushin Karate he got in Tekken 4. Tekken characters keep getting more and more weird flashy, spinny jump kicks and huge particle effects.
The moves are perfect except I'm a little sad that he didn't have any moves where he shoots devil Jin lazer 😕
Good. But that announcer voice ... I dont like it
Please don't use the same music everytime
Sephiroth would be proud of his one wing
Leroy in the back...
Seems like SF6 shooketh the Tekken. Hopefully they don't drop the ball. AND if they know what's good for them better start talking about/address netcode at some point.
The One Winged Fallen Angel Fights Again.
DUDE WHAT?!
Hot dog vendor when Kazuya gets hit on his trailer: 😐
Kazuma is more badasss..    Jin's wing effect is kinda gay. 😅😅😅
GET READY FOR THE NEXT BATTLE! LIGHTNING OF FATE! TEKKEN 8! NEW CHALLENGER! JIN KAZAMA!
So no more devil Jin. Good riddance
This may be the best version of Jin yet. I'm so hyped.
Did he said "strength isn't everything"?? That's the biggest change I've seen from someone in Tekken, like... Ever, lmao
Mah boi looks so cleeean
in movies they break mountains but in game they can't even break hotdog stand
The anime cringe is strong in this one. Hopefully all their effort doesn't go into improving the already well-rounded characters everyone played in 7 and they instead flesh out the underdogs at last..
Yo when I look carefully at his fighting  style, it has a little mix of Lar's fighting like I saw Lar's signature Arc Blast and he did a few flip kicks I recognize at little.
I'm so grateful my parents named me after Jin kazama, one of the best characters in the series and my favorite
2 4 into Zen? One of the best 10 frame punishes just got even better!
Dude with hotdogs "wtf if going on here"
Gosh I hope there is an option to  change the announcer voice...
Goddamm. New mixup is brutal.
Jin is looking clean
Jin looks sick!
Rage art seems a bit lack luster after seeing kazuya’s
There's some Devil Jin moves on his arsenal now .. guess DJ is out of Tekken 8
Naw Jins new moveset and costume Might main him in this game
AAAAAA
Dang what an overhaul, Jin looking AMAZING!! Parry is everything
This is just YUCKY🔥🔥
He probably can parry bullets.
Mucho efecto tiene el tekken 8 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑, tekken antes era más realista pero bueno quitando el efecto seguiré aprendiendome todo
Best character he’s that guy 😈😤
Goddamn he looks cool af
Ah yes, Kazuya's greatest ennemy.        Crackpot Hotdogs.
DAH! Bitches!  It’s crazy seeing most of Devil Jin’s moves incorporated and having him do the CD1 as regular Jin after unlearning most of the Mishima style  I do also dig his return back to his more heroic and noble personality before his heel turn  I look forward to learning more and using him as a pocket
damn jin saying " dorya" also on his rageart is funny hahaha!!
Yeah this is garbage definitely
Guy in the taco truck reacting to his imminent demise: 😐
Jin “The Answer Character” Kazama
naaa its like Jin + Akuma + Noctis + zafina mixed in one person ... too much for me
Main
Hyped af!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
20 mins early lets go
Kinda like his voice it sounds more like his tekken 3 one
So many changes in the Dialogues He's changed 😆😄
Jin is literally going all out in this instalment I barely recognise some of his new strings, hooly he hits hard, tekken 8 is looking amazing 👌🏼
Dear *GOD BAMCO!* This is what we've waiting for!! *MORE GOOD ASS TEKKEN 8!!!*
1:08 Omen Stance and Dragon Uppercut?!
“Strength isn’t everything” Wow!!! He has changed!
Perfect😈
Poor employee at 1:10's just trying to sell some hot dogs.
Anybody else notice the DIO voice actor for Jin …. 🔥🔥🤌🏾🤌🏾
원투윤회 전심윤회 나살어퍼가 스크류인거보니 계도전심 없앤거같은데 바닥뎀주는것도 기술유형안따지고 일단 한바퀴 돌게만들었고 진군생기고 우하돌이 악마손으로 교체했을진 모르겠지만 나락 콤보안되게한건 좀 신기하네
My dude been taking lessons from Guile from street fighter with those flash kicks
The edgy Boi arrives
HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damn. I'm not really a Tekken fan but I might be after this game lol
I hope King is next 💪
Shoooow, hein?
Oh hell yes! I'm impressed! Fantastic new intro and I like how he incorporates his devil form into some of his moves. Love the new costume and quotes. This is gonna be a great game guys!
Evil Jin be like: 0:52
Jun trailer or Xiaoyu reveal next please!🤩🙏🏻
trailer dropped outa nowhere XD
Lagunaaaa
waiting for lee and bryan
Jin having full control of the Devil Gene and incorperating it into his Karate is the hypest thing I have seen in all of Tekken. Ever.
Net
“power isn’t everything” yo who tf is this niqqa?? 😭
Cold as Jotaro Kujo
jin = new noctis
It looks so intense! I love it! I'm so hype right now!
OH MY GOD take my money bamco this looks amazing
CHESUTO!!!
I want to know if Angel or Unknown gonna be in this game!
These moves look so 2d , adios the beautiful 3d animation based on actual martial artists moves...
To all the guys that thought Jin and Devil Jin wouldn't get combined, 🤫🤫🤫
Seems like he was Trained by his Uncle Lars.
Every time an attack lands, it sounds like someone's firing a gun.
Yoooo I love how it seems he's in full control of his devil gene he's legit using it mid combo without fully transforming.
Looks like Jin had some character development while being KO'd in T7 and came out acting more like Rock Howard lol
Hypeeeee
i want Lidia
Strength isn't everything. BACKDASH AND PUNISHES ARE 🤣🤣
the amount of new jin mains when tekken 8 comes and i'm probably gonna end up being one of them
Jin Kazama: Like a Devil
Can't wait for all the tekken veterans to cry over that divekick and the new combo extension mechanics, then say "wow T5DR is better" for the next five years without actually playing T5DR and leaving that game's lobbies empty to play this like battered abused stockholmers
jin when too much hangout with lars
Wait, 2,4 isn't a knockdown anymore? What the hell is his 10f punish then?
Jin's new moveset is a combination of his Karate and devil power style, and I love it, as a Jin main I love this trailer!
It's nice he use bits of his Devil Powers without a need to transformed into one.
My man isn't saying strength is everything anymore, wow Jin.
I'm loving the consistency with which they're releasing new info.  Best promotional campaign Tekken has ever had. Hopefully we get a release date soon.
hope heihachi is in this game
My God this was beautiful
Looks like uncle Lars taught him up uf+4
Woah so they really are reworking those movesets from the ground-up huh?
Damn Jin, easy on the hotdog truck. The guy's just out here doing his job and you're beating up his truck as if it's a bonus stage car.
New tekken new jin drip let's go
Maybe I'm wrong but this trailer has the gameplay looking a lot more polished. Can't wait to play this.
Very nice
this gameplay has so much depth
The announcer is utterly trash
Perfection
THAT HOTDOG STAND THOUGH. Looks so freaking good. Can't way to see more of that hotdog stand, Kazuya could barely stand it...I wonder what role the Hotdog stand will play in the plot? This game looks so good lesssgoooo
kusoge
My guy went from "power is everything" to "strength isn't everything." Just shows his character development.
So Jin gets some character development.  Strength (power) isn't everything.   Hyped
Im happy to finally see sidesteps.
Sound quips have this energy of a KOF character especially of Kyo Kusanagi-esque.
Damn, that was fast! But let's go!!! 😆💖😆💖
Jun comes back and Jin becomes a pussy boi. 🤧 heihachi we miss your influence already
Lets fcking GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
That poor person getting their hotdog stand rocked 🥺
EVERY WEEK REVEALS?!
I am so excited for Tekken 8 I have now PS5 with it I can now play Tekken 8 when It Releases I hope Raven Bruce Irvin Baek Doo San and Wang Jinrei will return in Tekken 8
I like everything about Jin in Tekken 8, but his rage is a little lackluster compared to Kazuya’s rage
His combo are mix of devil jin 😍. 1:08 He got Heihachi Omen 💀  Edit:So no more DVJ 🥲
Another banger of a trailer.
not as hype as kazuya
My goal might be Mishima main 💀
i like how he saying that power isnt everything now lol
Well, no more Devil Jin
Please show Hwoarang gameplay already!!!
Wow Can't believe they added sephiroth to Tekken Before Tifa
GOD DAMN THIS GAME LOOKS SO GOOD. THIS STAGE ALONE SHITS ON EVERY STAGE IN T7
His daddy gon whoop his ass
New animations incorporating Devil Jin's moves 🔥
THE MAIN EVENT IS HERE
Damn this game looks Fire 🔥
Trailer is hype but the announcer is absolutely awful
Awesome 👍
Why does Jin have the wing motif like Rock Howard tho?
Great footage. I can't wait to pre-order, hah.
Plz reveal Lee and Armor King
"Strength isn't everything"  After 26 years our boys finally found himself
Hope Jin kills him (or defeat)
Yooo let's goooo
I'm guessing the flips are his Kazama style martial arts coming back now.
he finally control the devil gene
Finna d2
WHEEEEEENNNN??!!
We're starting the morning off right!!
Power is Everything becomes Strenght isnt Everything
😎 Badass Jin
Cool, but not good as the Kazuya trailer.
Guys let’s be onest  At the moment there are no one games can be compared to Tekken Maybe it’s me but these trailers are just AWESOME i dont ever remember something like this in games Tekken 8 is a “Masterpiece”
My main is back!
진 왤케 삭았어 ㅠㅠ...
Looking so good! Waiting for Jun or Asuka trailer.
HES COOOOLD
Okay now its time to release the Claudio Serafino trailer
Devil jin won't be in the game , that is for sure now !
Why does it still look like street fighter? Looks nothing like what was shown in the first trailer. Plus, why do they keep showing the same stage?
damn
Love it, can't wait to see how much Steve has changed
Did Jin just steal Rock Howard's FX and winpose
not really fan of this one, barely see the EWGF and the gameplay looks a lot like Lars
Everything was good but that special move was trash.
Amazing ❤️❤️my main
I am loving the Tekken 8 announcer.  Jin looks sick as hell.
1:09 is that mishima's cd1
Jin says Dorya ?
Wow going rock Howard win pose style
BRO THEY MADE HIM GODLY!!!!!
NEWWW CHALLENGGGAAA!!(Technically Jin isn't new) but still haha 😆 Whoa! I can see people who aren't Jin mains picking him up for the first time in Tekken 8. He's got so many powerful ways to make enemies life hell. He's Iike "Father hold my beer" great trailer 💥
Looks like he’s gained control over his dark powers
"Strength isn't everything" character developmemt 😍
For me this is not tekken anymore.
Moveset looks awesome, but animationwise I feel like Kazuya is a little more brutal
Bro this game looks so insane I cant wait
Jun please
1:31 STEP ASIDE ROCK HOWARD
Kazuya better
devil moves, mishima moves, jin moves .. t4xt7 vibes :D t8 shaping up the be lit af
I've been playing both father and son since I was a child, this is just a flex at this point lmao they look so good
Now we need the Tekken 3 characters trailer, or Paul and Law trailer
very first thing when im getting the game is modding out the announcer. annoying af
Leroy trailer, please
I'm excited for this new version of Jin, I like how he utilizes the devil whilst retaining his human form and doesn't simply transform like Kazuya does.  Edit: I'm speaking on his aesthetic, not moveset
More other character reveals!  ✨✨✨
My most anticipated trailer to see.        Worth it
New moves are freakn awesome! Not gonna complain about the rage art his move set are already a rage art. 😍
holy... this looks so juicy. I hope rest of the cast will be similarly amazing to watch
HOLLY MOLLY SO MANY FLASH EFFECTS
This Tekken is looking hella good so far might be the best Tekken I'll play now I'm just waiting for a lars trailer...damn i really hope they're putting some work on my boy i want him to look cooler than ever with sick ass moves and combos,and a cooler rage art. I have potential in a Lars trailer i think they may be showing him. some respect
Yo yall saw that ?? Oohwee!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Doing Devil Jin stuff as part of the standard kit now?? Was that a dragon uppercut?? Air kicks?? I'm super hyped for this "merged" Jin. "Power isn't everything"
The True Protagonist of Tekken has Arrived with Yin and Yang Colors,plus He Rocks White Way Better than His Father.
How the hell did Tekken, MK, and SF end up being released in the same year
"I shall never waver again"  *tekken 6 Jin Kazama flashbacks

Kaiji Tang as Jin for Tekken 8.
This game has the potential to be the best tekken ever.  Jin Kazama is simply brutal!
Ayo👀👀👀
Ayiiii less gooo
People sometimes say I'm exaggerating when I say 99% of Kyokushin Jin's playerbase "barely scratch the character's surface". Due to him being the most extreme character in the game in terms of reflex-based plays, by having an arsenal of perfectly tailored answers/punishers to basically every defensive situation in the game (answers that must be found hidden within his movelist/given immediately in order to actually work) and by being virtually the ultimate character, specially in a controlled environment (IE Tool-Assisted videos). He can perfectly answer questions no other character can, and I could give some examples if someone asked.  Then I play around with stuff like these and realize they are wrong and I am really not exaggerating: there's no skill ceiling to this character. The sky is the limit and most players barely reach for it. This character is the coolest elitist thing ever, and it's a pride and joy to main him. :)
PARRY IS EVERYTHING MY BOIS!!!!
L character
First
Omg 🎉❤
Nice
