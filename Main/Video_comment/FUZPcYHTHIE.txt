Masukan aja buat jojo, klo main jangan banyak ini itu greget ya greget aja, ngasih poin pukulan gk berbobot, contoh kevin itu greget yg di maksud kaya gtu 🙏
What racket is Victor Axelson using?
Wow!
Me: using 1 racket for 1 season Victor: 4 during this game
Jonatan did much better the first round with the calm demeanor but  kept missing kill shots.
Victor Chinese open..... says it all
Jojo banyak memberi poin viktor buwang nols terus
guys! do u agree china open is more exciting n thrilling than the world championships? give a comment pleeese!
How come those empires doesnt warn those coaches yelling at players when game is on?
J.C. was a bit too passive in 2nd game.
Well played Jojo but when Viktor plays this way, he is unbeatable...
Next..only kunlavut vitidsarn will difficult viktor axelsen n give a big challenge for him
Nhìn chung Christie vẫn dưới cơ axenxen nhiều
shiyuqi is too tired after the win over naraoka. guan zu smashes were powerful all the way. also he was so physical fit. hope he can keep on in finals. may the best of best wins.
kapan masuk final  si jojo
as I mentioned before the game if u cant win the opener against him u are done. anyway he is too fast for jojo.
These are the Victor courts😂
King viktor🐐👑🥇
