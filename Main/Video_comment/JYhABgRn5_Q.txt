Huh, I could have sworn Little Big Planet (or maybe a handheld spin off) was a vita pack in at one point. I bought the Vita, since it was the only console I could play every Persona game at the time, on (learning why most people start with 3 or later), but I remember playing Little Big Planet on it on bus rides that I couldn't devote a whole Persona session to, and I thought I had it as a pack in, but maybe I bought it.
10:21 And now we have Astro Bot as its own game! :')
15:14 "Welcome to Video Games"
26:33 says "the door opens up". "No gamecube". "It doesn't take enough room". "Not small enough". "I don't like red". "It looks like a clam. "The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". "I don't like the wii mini", "i put marinara sauce in it and it's stopped working". "I lost it under (and over) my couch". "I like red so much it distracts me from the video games". "Too many letter i's in the name". "Too much value". "My wife (and second wife) just left me for one". "If it had eyes, it would have stink ones". "Doesn't catch fish". "Uses power". "Can't palm it like a (football) and basketball". "Does NOT go well on toast". "Does not fit in shoes". "Doesn't last long enough in the microwave". "Has never tipped well at restaurants". "Treats service workers poorly". And finally.... "Treats itself even worse". 😂😂
16:16 I love how I had the EXACT same reaction
My TV friendly AVGN
23:52  Perfect spot for that piece!  Can't imagine where it might've fit better.
I think packing Super Mario World with the SNES was a mistake considering it's already a guaranteed seller and killer app.  I would've packed in a game that was destined to sell less copies on its own.  i.e., any other launch game.
You watch your mouth, Carnival Games is amazing.
I don't need this game to act like a gorilla 😂
I feel like Scott doesn’t realize some people just wouldn’t want Nintendo Land. Even if it’s $50 instead of $60 as part of the bundle. That’s still $50 on a game I have no interest in
I had never even heard of the original Murasame Castle until recently, but I loved the Nintendo Land Murasame Castle game so much when I was younger
For whatever reason I didn't get NintendoLand with my WiiU. Looks like I missed out
I hope I'm not late in reminding you to take out the Pizza.
10:23 scott straight up predicted 2024´s GOTY
Intellivision BlackJack Poker :)
There is also another version of the super Nintendo you should get. It also has super Mario All-Stars and also super Mario All-Stars plus super Mario world
I used to have a Wii u bundle that is with new super Mario Bros u along with new super Luigi u bundled in there two games for the price of one
Bro I 100% astros playroom and got all achievements
I loved the Mii Plaza and AR game, fishing the cheep cheep
00:34 relatable
Nintendo Switch 2 470€ - NS2 + MKWorld 510€ = instead of 80€ mkworld price is 40€
10:22 i bet Scott was happy when Astro Bot finally came out :3
Mario Kart World seems empty
Nah i remember playing face raiders with my friend on the bus as a kid and I loved that sh!t. Couldn’t tell you what happened in it tho, just remember putting my face in his system
best bundle i ever got was lbp2 and ratchet and clank all 4 one on the ps3
Altered Beast was a good pack in at the time. You had to be there. In the 80s people wanted arcade games at home. I played it often. Things are different today.
7:30 When I bought my SNES I got Mario World packed in and then was able to send away for Super Mario All-Stars for free. The 90s were a different time.
iirc super swing golf/pangya was a pack in game in 2006 in Japan.  I guess Wii Sports kinda stands in for this.
Watching this on my ps2 eyetoy
18:18 the pack in was pictochat
Wait until Scott hears about the Switch 2’s Tech-demo that you have to pay for
Now, Nintendo wants you to pay $10 for a _welcome tour._  That should’ve been a pack-in. Why?!
exactly 27 reasons why he doesn't like the wii mini, with both joke reasons and real complaints
nintendo land is a sleeper game i use to play that with my friends all the time
15:45 “i think bundling a multiplayer only game doesn’t make much sense” …like nintendoland
Wii Sports is still one of the Wiis greatest games ever made and the reason I keep my system and the Switch still can’t top its classics
Nintendo land is a very underrated game for the Wii U. I still play it with my family to this day
Crazy how scott predicted astro bot as a full blown game
rewaching this now knowing there is an astros playroom game (not the tech demo) is kinda funny
"This was before stars were invented"
I remember getting my father a 2600 for christmas like he used to have, and him scaring the shit out of me when he phased through walls in combat.
Thank God we got astrobot a couple years later :)
Reggie fought to have wii sports packed in with the wii
I already have ps1 & the Wii (can’t find my game discs), just bought ps2 5000 & 7000, ps3 & Xbox 360 and waiting on heaps of games to arrive. 😑
Scott, Astro Bot released.
Truly the Wii Mini is the tragic figure of a generation.
I always liked Altered Beast as a kid. I liked the way the power ups changed your character, and that the final form was a wolf man
For me, Wii Sports is the first game that comes to mind when it comes to console pack-ins. It’s such a classic!
I grew up with a Super Nintendo and didn't have Super Mario World. Not sure if we got a pack in game or a used system or what
The problem with Nintendoland is that it was given an impossible task, to prove why the game pad needed to be a thing, when the game pad didn't need to be a thing.
Idc what anyone says, Nintendo Land was peak
Altered Beast being a pack-in explains a lot. I didn't have a Genesis growing up, but it sometimes felt like I was the only one who didn't. Plenty of my friends were Sega kids and they all had Altered Beast. I honestly assumed everybody else saw something in the game I somehow missed. Turns out they had as much choice in the matter as I did on the day I got circumcised.
89 b.c.e anyone?
Astro Bot ftw hell yeah
16:16 This bit always cracks me up. Nothing has to be said about whatever that game is, just move along.
6:53 me and my friends still occasionally bust out Nintendo Land since Mario Run, Animal Crossing (Sweet escape? I dont rememberthe bame of the animal crossing one) and the Luigis mansion game are so fun to play together. Also the Train is great. Its fun 1v1ing each other in Ninja Castle or Captain Falcon's F-Zero Twister thing. Great experience 👍
Imagine if Astro playroom could be it’s own game   Astro bot walks in
the only reason there is a kinect in my house is that i use it for vr
It’s sad that the Switch 2 won’t have a pack-in game with the normal release
Nintendoland didn’t work for me because I didn’t have anyone to play the 4 player games with growing up
And Now Switch 2 is making us pay for the tutorial...
Next video is games that should’ve been pack in games. Starting with switch two console tour
Man
Sanic  Spoderman
10:19 The possibilities were Game of the Year
Frisbee golf was incredible the motion controls was top tier n tons of fun with friends
“How is Scott gonna bitch about this one?” “I found a way” 😭
I am still gonna call Astro's Playroom a tech demo and can't tell me otherwise
Here years later and this was literally a demo 10:24
Wii sports resort is my second favorite Wii game (behind Mario Galaxy) and no one will ever change my mind
I may be an idiot but I just thought of something. Since if they do pull a 3ds nub or not, the cartridge won’t work either way and will just display an error message saying it can only be played on a Nintendo _____ system. Since that is what it does if you cut the nub off. So it’s just a little cute change that also technically function. So unless they want to be cute again, they’ll probably be identical or maybe a slightly different color.
Predicted Astro bot
When will you make a video on Astro Bot?
Fun fact: the 3ds also had a breakout game hidden in the browser
7:34 seeing the “wound” on your thumb is just… ugh. Painful.
I freaking want a Nintendo 3DS so badly. I might possibly find some good Nintendo 3DS games that are just for girls (Barbie, Disney Princess, Imagine, etc).
Nintendo gave you a Luger with a game????!!!!
TBH honest I was at a church camp at one point and the guy hosting had a PS3 with the move controllers and Sports Champions, and holy mother of gears and cogs we played the hell out of it, Ping Pong, Disc Golf and all.   Except bocce. All my homies hate bocce. But it was a very cool little game, out of the context of Wii Sports clone cause Nintendo did it
1-2-Switch being a pack in actually would've hurt the console. It feels waaaaay to hard trying to be like Wii Sports. If that was the big advertised launch game, people would just say "Oh, it's the Wii again".   BOTW was, well, a game. A very good game. The Switch got more casuals into gaming by trusting them to actually know how to play a game.
Astrobot... your wish is my command...
10:18 Scott probably had a great goty
I forgot 1 2 Switch exists entirely
PlayStation TV left the chat
What could’ve Astro been if it wasn’t a pack-in? A GOTY!!
10:20 Flash forward to game of the year 2024
2 years later, Scott got his wish about astro, being a full game and not just a tech demo.
Warioware move it would have been a perfect console show case if it came out around the beginning of the switch lift I think
10:15 it happened!!! like 5 months agoo yippeeee
I’m sorry the vita had a back touchpad!? What???
Hmm, “what if Astro’s Playroom was its own game? Imagine the possibilities.” Welp, it happened. And it got GOTY.
21:59 "There's no single player." ???
Imagine telling this Scott that Astro's Playroom got a sequel and it won game of the year.
are we getting that Nintendoland bts hangout footage?
4:51 AH Wendy's employee jumpscare
We had Wii Sports and Wii Play. Those two together were great, I have lots of memories playing with my mom, it's the only video game she'd play with me. I also grew up with Tetris on the Gameboy Colour and it was my favourite game of the ones I had as a kid
when My family got the Snes we got donkey kong country as a pack in title. I live in Sweden btw, maybe we just got a different pack in. For my money I think Donkey kong was the better showcase title than super mario world.
10:21 scott predicted astro bot
It is now it's own game Scott :)
Nintendo Land was peak. You can’t change my mind.
About Mario Chase, the Nintendo land game: me and my cousins always played that one. So much fun. But, I noticed that it can reveal signs of a bad WiFi chip: it needs to transmit the camera signal to the TV for the camera view of the game pad player. This leads to the connection unstable pop up happening every time, whereas it doesn’t happen on anyone other games. Strange.
I always wished Nintendo would put Terri 99 as a pack-in because (at list in my country) it's free, and even when you buy it, it's the same cost as the membership for a year, and a lot of times only comes with it.
10:20 we don’t need to imagine the possibilities. this series broke the Nintendoland Curse and became a GOTY winner!!!
10:18 and that game won goty
Scott predicting that astro's play room but bigger being amazing baffles me
This aged well actually. Astro bot won GOTY 2024 yay!
TIL that there was a Wii Mini
0:30 pop in a gay
astro bot
16:33 I'm still playing "Activity Log" to this day (haven't beaten it) 😢
Who gonna tell him 10:39
Do you like a modern AVGN if he wasn't angry and was simply just depressed and coping with comedy
y la xbox original, que venia con el halo ce?????
Yeah i got my 3ds as a kid with mario kart 7 pre installed After i bought the damn cartridge
You didn't get the wii Sports in a box in north America?
0:52 that was my first console game system and those two free games I played the snot out of.  Kung Fu Panda and LEGO Indiana Jones The Original Adventures goes so freaking hard!
26:04 chanbara on Wii sport resort be like
Scott predicted the new Astro game
0:17 me when I am disappointed because I am disappointed about being disappointed at Little Deviants.
Have to agree with the Wii and Wii U. I thought the Wii was dumb at first... until I tried Wii sports and just how much fun it actually was (I mostly like the tennis). When the Wii U came out, I thought it was dumb. I still think the Wii U is dumb. Nothing utilised the screen in a way that I had a turning moment and realised I was wrong like the original Wii.
1:20 That Bobby brown Sonic sample though 😤
You forgot top spin and SEGA gt 2002 on the Xbox.
10:38 good news! They made it into a full game now
I absolutely cannot get over Scott making his own baby scream noises instead of just using a sound effect at 2:25
10:18 welp.  You got what you wanted.  Congrats.
10:23 they heard you and we have Astro bot. One of the greatest video games of all time.
There is a new Astros playroom game
I love the delivery of “why do I wish that?”
Meanwhile my smash bros splatoon bundle Wii U
I got a condom ad on this video
he predicted astro bot
you just have to wait
Welcome Park on the PsP Vita wasn't mentioned???? The actual pack in game that came pre-installed on every psp vita????  scott is a fake and a fraud fr
I think the biggest problem with the Wii-U (besides existing), is that the entire design concept goes against a core principle of what Nintendo consoles had become over the previous 3 generations. I mean, The N64 and GameCube both had 4 controller ports, and Wii-Sports was SPECIFICALLY designed to be a 2/multiplayer experience. All 2 of the 3 were arguably THE BEST "Christmas Day" Consoles to ever be released. The kind of thing you could hook up to the family TV in the living room and everyone engage with a have a good time because it was designed with couch co-op in mind. And while the GameCube would flesh out the multiplayer/couch co-op aspect of the console further down the line, the launch titles didn't really reinforce that idea very well.   But what the heck are you supposed to do with the Wii-U? By the time you set it up and orient yourself with the Gamepad and game (because every game has a big adjustment period on the Wii-U), Christmas Dinner is already over. And even then, none of the games really feel like they're giving you a next-gen Nintendo experience. Nintendoland is just busy work. It's just something to exist so that they could say they have a pack-in title. Because ultimately it's hard to frame your console as family-friendly and couch co-op/multiplayer focused when the controller is something that only one person can use at a time, and has functionality that any other controller you could buy will be missing. ,
21:35 "They're all sports we know!"  Europeans who don't play baseball:
Astro bot came out this year. So wish granted
Scott with his glasses over his blindfold cracks me up. He looks like a cartoon character like that.
I won't ever talk shit about Wii Sports. Also, Saturn had a pack-in title of the 3 "Virtua" games. Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop, and Virtua Racing. I'll never forget as a kid hearing...Daytoooooona Daytona! lol. I know I can't be the only one that remembers it. I guess you're too young to remember that series of games. I got Saturn when I was 11 in 1995, and I was the only person that had one, haha. I feel you must be too young to have remembered that. Everyone knows that Genesis (MK1) came with Sonic, and the MK2 came with Sonic 2, same with Super Mario World coming from SNES...EVERYONE knows that was the pack in the game. It was probably the best pack-in game EVER, for sure. It was smart of them not to include Mario 64 with it, to be honest, because it was guaranteed that 90% of people buying the N64 at launch would buy it anyway. When I bought it at launch (after already owning a PS One/Saturn), I definitely picked it up for sure, and the hard (at the time) to get memory card expansion (not expansion slot added RAM cart, that was later on). I'll never forget getting consoles like PS2 at launch 10.10.2000, SNES at launch when I was 7, Dreamcast at launch 9.9.1999 (still remember lol), and X-Box 360 at launch (11/2005) because I worked at Best Buy hehe.  One last "everyone knows" thing is the NES coming with Mario/Duck Hunt & Gun. I still can't believe you didn't include the Sega Saturn. Because it was the last Sega product to include a starter game. You should have mentioned that PS One and Saturn both had sampler discs with them that had a level or section from a game to play, with constantly updated versions. It's pretty sad on a side note that they made more advancements in the first 15 years of major gaming (NES 1985 to PS2 2000) compared to the 24 years between 2000-2024... which included X-Box, X-Box 360, PS3, Gamecube, Wii, PS4, X-Box One, Switch, PS5, and X-Box S. The improvements in graphics/AI was not significantly upgraded like actually seeing it make HUGE advancements during the first 15 years. It shows a lot of laziness and not utilizing the system's full power. There are games on PS3 that look worse than PS2 games (Silent Hill 2/3 comes to mind when compared to garbage SH: Homecoming) and there are a lot of other examples.
Well Scott Astro did get its own game, and apparently it’s great.
My DS didn't even have a pack in.
granny mcgee picks up her new 3ds which her old friend recomended and she sees metroid prime hunters demo  what happens next?
I can’t tell if it’s because I just prefer the art style but the Mario on snes definitely looks like it has better graphics compared to sonic imo
10:18 Astro Bot: “Hold my DualSense”
Wherever Scott is, he must be happy. He got more Astro just like he wanted.
As owner of now full game Astro Bot, the game already makes me emotional when just installing it.
Not sure why it’s so funny to me, but I lost it when Scott turned on the n64 with no game and it just said “GO BACK TO TARGET”
10:22 Well that’s what we’re getting
10:21 THEIR MAKING IT INTO A FULL GAMEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Excellent analysis. Grew up with Combat as my pack in and played the **** out of it.
Did the Wii U guy call Duck Hunt a gimmick?
Damn alex Kidd on master system.
The Astro playroom commentary aged very well (Astro bot being announced)
The Wii Mini not catching fish is honestly the worst thing about it. Thanks for mentioning that!.
10:20 his request has been heard
I still remember my parents and I playing Wii Sports when we got the Wii, and my dad getting SO COMPETITIVE during the bowling because I was throwing a perfect game, and he, who bowled in leagues as a child, was not-- my last throw, he knocked my arm so I couldn't get a perfect game and my mother and I yelled at him for being a sore loser for like ten minutes, with him saying he didn't do anything.  xD
If you want astros playroom to be a real game there’s a game called Astro bot that you should check out…
Astro bot is getting his own full game now on September 6th! If you really wanna play a real game, now you can!
All consoles should have a game with it.
Technically the 3ds had a secret game in the internet browser
Say what you want about Nintendo land. But some of my best memories were playing Mario chase with my buddies many moons ago.
My WiiU was packed in with not only Nintendo Land, but ALSO SM3DW, which was insane for 6 year old me. God I miss those days
13:04 this man owns cathrine full body
10:23 well it happened
It is very funny that Astro's Playroom *is* getting a full game now
Having Combat, a 2-player only game, as the pack-in for the Atari 2600 made perfect sense.  This was the Pong era.
Dont ever disrespect kung fu panda game like that its honestly one of the best fighting games ever made! I remember those fond nights of cheesing the stun lock in ranked online
It's face raiders ........…........................... I LOVE FACE RAIDERS
1:57 made me laugh very hard for some reason
You sound like someone held a gun next to your head and told you to film a vedio
Honestly I think the reason people think 1 2 switch should have been a pack in is less they wanted it for free and more just  People assume its better than it is  Nobody I know has it, and I only played it once at a person's house who I don't remember the name of  It's not worth the price, doesn't look worth the price, and the marketing revolved around it being a good showcase of the joycons even though it was actually a shitty one  So like- people thinking it should have been a pack in is a pretty understandable reaction tbh
4:50 well I can’t she’s dead, DAMNIT SCOTT
Naruto
I know it’s not a “console”, but…it really is, and Aperture Desk Job for the Steam Deck is a great pack-in for the device. It’s short, and really just a tech demo, but it’s a delight and really sells the device. I don’t know why it isn’t pre-installed and more assertively put in the face of a new user, as there’s a lot about the device that makes much more sense after you’ve played it, such as the capacitive joysticks to activate gyro.
Astro's Playroom was technically already its own game. On the PS4, there was a PSVR game that was basically the same thing as it minus the controller gimmicks. It interacts with both Astro and the Player really well and it was a full fledged game with several worlds to go through. Worth a playthrough if you have the budget for a PSVR and the patience for it.
Scott, as a fellow Ohioan i relate to those thumbs.
Why wasn’t red dead redemption 2 the ps4 pack in game it would have been amazing people would have rushed to the store loved the ps4 and boom the sales go up
26:33 I love how the only thing that is actually fair is "No Gamecube." and the rest is some random reasons that have no relevancy to the actual console
Just discovered your videos and holy shit they're so long and your enthusiasm is so relaxing that I could listen to these to fall asleep BUT they're so well made and you're so energetic that I'm rooted to my seat listening to you talk, just paying too much attention to actually, y'know, sleep.
Funny you say that about Astro’s playroom I got the plat
I am the person who bought the plants Vs zombies and fable Xbox 360
My baby don’t mess around
1234
Ooh, i cannot wait for the full astro game. Playstation hit it out of the park with the pack in, and i hope they do so again with the sequel.
"I wanted more out of Astro's playroom" Boy do I have news for you
10:25 GOOD NEWS!
Scott: *complaining about astros play room* 2024 Sony: We hear u fam *makes full astrobot game*
10:24 this aged well
Knowing we’re getting an actual Astro game makes me hope Scott likes it
10:20 SUP BITCHES
my nana never touched her DS so now Brain Age is nostalgic to me -_-
Well looks like Astro Bot just got his own game dude! You got ur wish!
Coming back to 8:32 after Astro Bot was announced just today! We're finally getting the full game!
10:23 yoooo
Just came back from state of play 2024, turns out astros playroom is becoming a full game 4 years later as just “Astro bot”. Honestly, I am super stoked about that, I loved playroom so much!
HE LIVES IN OHIO
26:30 take the time to read all those. It's hilarious and worth it
Ik some text are off. Just take this with a grain of salt
Scott takes the family guy cutaway style and actually makes it funny most of the time
23:53 this hurts to watch
anybody else own a wii u and then cringe when people insult it?
I'm sorry, I just can't continue the video until I know something, is Scott trying to imply that Altered Beast isn't a great game?
I was a young fool I bought a Wii U and I got the base set cause I wanted the white one not knowing about the pack in Nintendo land which I never ever got for my Wii U till recently still didn't touch the Wii U though
For all of my life I did not know that the Wii had online functionality until I watched Scott the Woz.
“it’s like an abacus: this counts?” is a golden line
god this guys so annoying how do i stop him from coming on my fyp
astros playroom is actually one of my favourite 3d platformers ever made
I don't think anybody was asking for 1 2 switch to be a pack in.....they were saying that it wasn't worth what it costs to buy separately and if Nintendo wanted to get rid of copies, they should have just packed it in with the Switch. Because at best, it's sort of a game that can demonstrate what the joy cons can do. But yeah, never heard anybody asking for the game.
"Man, this pumpkin can't play football." -Scott the Woz, 2022
reasons the wii mini sucks: The door opens up. No GameCube. It doesn't take up enough room. Not small enough. i don't like red. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like the color red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter I's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes, Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
Oohhhhh black is GOOD! I was confused about your reviews to comments until I figured it out at Wii Sports! Lolz
scot: my croch huts  me: .........
Dude there's enough pack-ins versions on so many systems you could prolly make 5 of these videos
Oh yea the Kinect I ended up using it as a mic lol
Astros playroom for ps5 was such a good treat
Obviously Wii Sports was the best pack-in game of all time. No other pack in title by itself ever sold 50 million consoles the way Wii Sports did. Fifty million of us bought the Wii just to play Wii Sports and never, ever played a GameCube game or any "real" game beyond perhaps Mario Kart the entire time wii owned them. Games never get that. The Wii wasn't designed for them, and the fact that there were "real" games for the Wii made no difference in terms of its sales. Without Mario Galaxy and Red Steel 2, the Wii still would have won the 7th Generation just due to sales to Exergamers. Thanks, Wii Sports!
I have four siblings and we loved playing Nintendo land
The Atari segment is a bit uncharitable. Pac-Man and Space Invaders weren't out in 1977, and Breakout for 2600 wasn't done. The concept of a single player game was such a novel idea that the first reviewers called them "solitaire" games. So you needed to have multiplayer. The only launch title with both multiplayer and single-player modes was Video Olympics, a pong cartridge. Atari couldn't risk packing in that game, it would be seen as archaic by a gaming audience fully saturated with the first gen's pong clones.
I genuinely can't begin to comprehend how brilliant the pun at 8:33 was
8:34 I love that game!
16:40 that sound scared the crap out of me as a little kid
3:19 XD
Had my ps vita in my pocket in the opening
I actually like 1-2 switch
Scott the Woz is a crip.
the only real important part of nintendo land is the fact that it was one of the only spinoffs for pikmin that there was besides hey pikmin
I didn’t realize that this video was only a year old until it played the new theme for the end cards
Why don’t you like Keith Courage
My Atari XE has Missile Command, built in, I played that to DEATH :)
I love scott playing with his wii like a toy, he looks like he's having so much fun, it even has had me doing it occasionally
To be totally fair to nintendo land, the use of Nintendo ips actually got my mom to love Pikmin! Shes never played a mainline game, but she loves those little guys so mucu
The reason Astro’s Playroom is only an hour long is because the controller’s battery life isn’t much longer
17:38
I, having a Wii u and a truck-load of hand me down Wii games because you know, where else am I going to get them, am now the proud owner of THREE PACK IN COPIES OF WII SPORTS, ONE OF THEM WITHOUT THE SLEEVE, ONE OF THEM TAPED. I also got a copy of Nintendo land but the disc was scratched, rip. I had to play the library copy and honestly I think I was overhyped.
Shout out Modern warfare  og on ds I played it and beat it and ogs know how hard that machine gunner in that ally is
To give 1-2-Switch a tiny bit of credit, visually impaired and blind people can play and enjoy most of it no issue. There are very few video games you can say that about.
Arms should have been switch pack in for the first year or so.
Did not review Alex Kidd for the Sega Master System and did not review Asteroids for the Atari 7800. Incomplete list. 2/10
everytime my sister and i get together at holidays we bust out the 3ds and play face raiders of our young awkward faces
23:50 the spot they put the L piece physically hurt me
ATVOffroad fury for the PS2
An honorable mention could have been Mario Kart 7. Although not a pack in at the start of the system’s life, Mario Kart 7 was a pack in for a majority of the 3DS’s life. Seriously, from 2014 to EoL, you couldn’t go two 3DSes without purchasing Mario Kart 7 alongside it.
i bought the animal crossing switch and was surprised to discover there was no animal crossing in it, I paid $60 extra to have a picture of tom nook on the dock. Amazing.
Nintendoland is definitely one of my favorite games ever made. I pull out and set up my Wii U from my closet every once in a while just to play it. We should get a switch version with new minigames to better fit the switch and finally find something to do with that IR camera outside of the funny white reflective stickers in the cardboard box.
Scott is so epic
2:01 ''go back to target''😂
Where's my steamdeck pack-in game? You know, desk job? Man that game was honestly great ^-^
I miss Nintendoland, it was an awesome game. Wish the WiiU had never gotten lost
17:14 Scott commits a warcrime
What about aperture desk job on steam deck
My primary school had a wii u that came with Nintendo land and I remember how everyone would fight for the wii u because you could play as the ghost in that one Luigi’s mansion mini game. I honestly only have good memories of that console despite never owning one
I thought you were a good person and then you trashed altered beasts
❤❤❤
I remembered that my dad bought me the Deluxe WiiU with Nintendo Land and Mario Bro's U  He sold it later for drugs
Most people like myself didn't even realize the wii U was it's own console and not like a wii pro version
Name a more iconic system pack in combo than geutenberg print&press and the bible
5:48 “fun in a way online flash games were fun” is a powerful insult
A Wii sports "Campaign" would have been nice... wtf are you talking about Scott lmao😂
Man i wish 1,2 Switch was a pack in me and no one i know has even tried it despite all of us owing Switchs and expressing interest. It would have been a perfect pack in and disagree it's too small
Scott on Wii sports: “they’re all sports we know” Most people outside NA: wtf is a baseball?
Not a pack in but it is odd to play Spyro on not PlayStation hardware.
Everyone’s Xbox came with uno
Dam im glad i got sw battlefront with my ps4
Is it bad I liked Nintendo land a lot more then wii sports😅
wiii mini??
Scott looks like he’s going insane in the thumbnail
How DARE you disrespect face raiders
26:30
Astro's Playroom is probably my favorite packin title of all time. Its the first time I've looked at a game thats completely free and said "Yes, I'd pay money for this." Its just so damn charming.
Nintendoland was an underrated masterpiece. Especially the legend of Zelda and Metroid mini games.
Just now finding out Astros play room is a game and I got it in 2020
fuck u scott, i wanted to get a ps vita after seeing that little deviants demo unironically, it looks cool for that time, all those features
16:23 I like to imagine when he called them over to film this bit, he just said “Hey guys, can you come over and laugh at me for like 3 seconds when you have the time?”
When I got the connect I never played connect adventures I threw it away as soon as I got it then I played the sonic skate game
The "dad disagrees" joke hits home for me because my dad worked on the advertising for the Wii U and when it launched, he refused to buy one.
You can’t forget Uno and every xbox released ever since the beginning of time
Little Deviants walked so that Astro’s Playroom could run.
He calls money bones
I find this very negatived minded. Just because your grandma is dead, doesn't mean you can't still convince her that the Wii U was good.
21:52 is that a mona lisa mii playing baseball?
It cannot be overstated how impressive the ball game is in 1, 2, Switch. You have to use it to appreciate it. It's like the experience of 3D on the 3DS (when used well). You can really feel the balls roll individually in a box
How dare you disrespect Face Raiders, Scott.
Scott: I HATE DEVIANTS!!! I HATE NINTENDO LAND
2:50 I was curious about this and it turns out they DID have a star rating system in the 30's (kind of). Around that time certain critics rated on a scale of 0-3, but it wouldn't become standard until it was used in a French magazine in the 50's.
26:33 shout outs to Scott for one of the funniest bits being gone in a second. I doubt that anyone paused in order to see what all of the scrolling text said. But it is some of the funniest things I have seen in a while. Every single line is gold and I really like that there isn't ever a line like "does anyone even read this?"
You irreversibly fucked up your life as a Nintendo gamer by having played and created nostalgia for Brawl before the first two
I honestly think Tearaway would work better as a PSVita pack-in. It was a lot of fun playing the game, and I feel like it was heavily underrated during its time.
25:40 28:23
I swear I bought the Vita at (or near) launch and I don't think I even bothered redeeming the download code for Little Deviants.  Still use my Vita all the time, too. It's perfect for PSX games when I'm not at home. Sony did that thing *_dirty._*
25:20 What's even funnier is that four out of those six games are in Wii Sports Resort and one of them is kind of in it.
I can tell you that Super Mario Bros really felt like the future in the mid 80s. It straight up annihilated the Commodore 64 games I was accustomed to on every level.
I love how in this video he roasts new birds then moves on.
11:05 How long did it take them to flip all of those books around to avoid unwanted marketing?
One thing about Mario World is that at the time, pack in games weren't about showing off hardware. The hardware followed the games. SMW was a game that was just meant to be the best Mario it could be,and the SNES was built to run it. That's all. That's what sold the SNES. Not going "check out the bells and whistles of our console," but "check out this great game!" There's a reason none of the system showcase games have any lasting appeal but Mario World and Mario 64 are still considered among the best of all time.
I won't lie to you I'm a lot more into Nintendo Land than I reasonably should be
Id argue that nintendo land isn't a pack in, you had to pay extra and as much as you can say "its a $60 that came with the console" thats literally just how console bundles work, plus its not a game thats worth $60 to most people
I remember buying a 3DS and taking pictures of my shits in the toilet to put on the enemies’ faces.
16:38 the game that made Scott shit his pants
I will always hold this episode close to my heart, cause it came out on my last day of high school. That day after coming back home I was feeling quite down and then this appeared on my notifications tab. You  made a sad day a little bit better for me scott, and you probably won't ever know you did.
4:52 Live Target Employee reaction
I got the delux set when i was in middle school and I still love it
Am I being pranked? Wii Mini? There's no way that's a real thing, I've never seen or heard anything about such a thing existing until this video
Can we talk about how this mans wii u has played the mario chase game 110 times
I wish the Switch came with a pack-in game
The best part of Kinect Adventures is the score. They got Daniel Pemberton, they guy who composed the score for Spider Verse and The Bad Guys, so of course there are some bangers on it.
Fake Draw alone makes one two switch worth it. If it was ten dollars, not fifty.
16:28 didn't Brain Age come pre installed on the DS as well?
🤗🤗
_goopy_
I have never even heard of Nintendo Land
1:40 he gave me PTSD when he showed the PlayStation move…
The problem with super Mario world being a pack-in game is that it destroyed sales for the other games. Why would you buy something else on the first 6 months if you had that game for free to play over and over. It's a long game, full of secretes and so totally replayable
Astro's Playroom is the bomb, don't you dare diss it
I actually really like 1-2 switch the sports game gave me the same feeling as wii Sports
Ngl. It feels like Scott nowadays can find a way to bitch about anything.
Scott having a child is almost as funny as his Wii play addiction
The reasons to not like the mini wii is hilarious
Scott could talk about the A button for 20 minutes and could still be funny enough to make me spit water while laughing
Nice injury, thumb
I wonder why Scott fears face raiders
I now want a wii U
i only rented 1-2 Switch from GameFly but I had a lot of stupid fun with it
To be fair… I did convince grandma to play the Pikmin game on Nintendo land lol
Nintendo land goes hard af
I was not expecting 0:33
stop saying bad words
Wii U deluxe has the same price and the gig data storage as the switch OLED.
honestly a new Pokémon snap (or something similar) would’ve made an amazing tie in for the wii U
How would you rate the ColecoVision pack-in game of Donkey Kong?  Also the Intellivision's Las Vegas Blackjack/Poker, the Atari 5200's Super Breakout?
I got a Wii when I was 6-7 yo, and it never came with Wii Sports
rat
I like how you glossed over the fact the deluxe version of the Wii U was also 32gb instead of 8gb, which at the time was a HUGE upgrade.
0:33  and no im not making a funny thing to say.
No scott you don't have eyes 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
The perfect pack in for the Vita would have easily been Tearaway this is the game specifically designed to show what the Vita was capable of, it was made for this. To be fair I guess the vita pack in was also technically welcome park which also accomplished that goal but it absolutely sucked as a game. When I first got my Vita, welcome park was the only game I had for a while.  My parents were very apologetic, and I was all like "It comes with apps" Yeah I just used it for Zen pinball and YouTube until I got something
16:18 that’s the best “What?” Scott has ever Said 😂
You could talk about a m&m and I would still watch
❗️My Timestamps:  7:08 Though I would've loved to get 'Super Mario World', our SNES was the yellow-boxed 'Mario Allstars' one in December 1994  13:09 Our NES was the 'Action Pak' and came with two Control Pads and 'Super Mario Bros. 1' in mid-1992.  18:04 My Black DS: Lite came with 'New Super Mario Bros.' as part of a deal at GameStation back in October 2006.  19:05 We got a Mega Drive with 'Altered Beast' in mid-1994 and I personally like the Game...
For me, the best parts of Nintendo land was the Zelda, Metroid, and pikmin games
I mean, if I had a Time Machine I could see myself creating a pack-in game review scale in a 1930’s newspaper. It’s one of those chaotic things you could do that probably wouldn’t really effect much in the long runs
When i was like 6, my parents bought me a gameboy.  The pack in game for it was Killer Instinct.   I wish i would have gotten tetris.
For Vita, Tearaway showcased the system really well
I actually think the vita's pack in is wellcome park, a simple minigame collection with barely any theme or character, but it was fun. It came preinstalled on ALL vitas, not just the launch edition.
This man is too powerful he found a way to bitch about super mario world
_"Combat can be fun"_  -Scott the Woz, 2022
nes and snes had good ones and everything else is just ok to bad
Just when i thought my opinion of you couldnt get any lower, you dissed the Wii U.
The main difference between the Wii U regular and deluxe was the storage capacity. Regular had 8 gigs and deluxe had 32 for $50 more, plus a game. I was working at a Best Buy when it released and was baffled at it. Such a bad deal to get the regular edition.
I stand by the belief that Sony’s biggest sin with the playstation move was not taking Gladiator Duel from Sports Champions and making it into it’s own game. Expand on the gameplay, add new stages, weapons, characters that aren’t one-note NPCs, hell, even a story mode. Sony missed a huge chance to ACTUALLY go head to head against Nintendo by not realizing how enjoyable the Gladiator Duel mode was and doubling down on it.
We had an Xbox 360 that came with 2 pack in game of the year titles which was fable 2 and halo 3
I remember getting an N64 for Christmas with no game... I think the anticipation between then and getting to actually play something was the first contributor to my eventual blood pressure issues.
Scott, I'm shocked. How could you overlook Aladdin being a pack-in for the Genesis in 1993?
id love to see him get upset at oculus first steps
22:19  SCOTT! THE PIZZA
I legit think Nintendoland is one of the best multiplayer games of all time.
I lived in Japan during the heyday of the 3DS (specifically during the release of Pokemon X and Y) and at that time streetpass was basically magic. You could pretty much bring your 3DS on any regular subway commute and come home with a full plaza. Knowing that so many of the put-together looking people on the train were playing pokemon and monster hunter gave you a strange feeling of community. Like an unspoken secret handshake. It was a feature perfectly matched to a public transport culture… which is probably why it isn’t as fondly remembered by americans, come to think of it.
In defense of Nintendo Land, it went HARD when I was younger (thanks Luigi’s mansion, and mario chase for the memories)
I just started playing Astros Playroom this week after having a PS5 for a year and I'm really bummed I waited so long. Like Scott, I wished there was more of it but what there is, I enjoyed it
I got the Wii U Deluxe edition, but in Australia I got Mario kart 8
The Sega Master System came with up to three pack-ins—we had one with Hang On! and Safari Hunt, and the SMS BIOS had a hidden maze game if you held a button combo during power-on. Fun times!
Nintendo Land is goated
Find mii is called something else In the uk (and presumably  Europe) it’s called streetpass quest, and in fact most of the “mini” games have streetpass before their us names
Did anyone else pause to read what Scott didn't like about the Wii mini? "Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse." Comedy gold
I bought a switch used and it had a copy of Has Been heros in it and I was so confused lmao 🤣
I played keith courage in alpha zone. Basically the only turbo grafx game I played. It was cool
I just watched through the last five years of Scott the woz content and man this is probably one of the best YouTube channels on the platform
I wanna see this guy talk about astros playroom, if he ever does
9:15 Scott showing his Nintendo bias.
Am I the only person who watches all this man’s videos, forgets that he exists and than a year later watches all the new ones?😂
I got my WiiU long after they offered it with nintendoland (we got mariokart 8 instead) and didn't get nintendoland for YEARS afterwards, and honestly its pretty mid. in terms of games that make you realize how great the controller setup is, Wind Waker HD really did it for me, it was so convenient to be able to just glance down to see your inventory/map without having a minimap on your screen or having to pause every time.
I have a Wii but I just realised I don’t have Wii Sports. I have Wii Play. Were there Wiis that didn’t come bundled with Wii sports? I’m just realising I’ve never played Wii Sports when for half of my life I thought I had and I don’t know what to do. My life is a lie. I didn’t play golf, I played billiards.
I have 1 2 Switch and none of my other friends have Nintendo Switches so they would often want to play mine when they came over. One of the games my friends would often request is 1 2 Switch. It honestly does a good job as a party game. I’ve played that games a bunch and it’s a great way to have some fun when you have a group of friends over. It probably would be even more fun when you’re drunk. 1 2 Switch and Just Dance were the games my friends always wanted to play when they came over and I always had a lot of fun playing them .
I got to be honest, after watching this video and seeing Nintendo Land, I actually want to buy a Wii U. That game genuinely looks really fun and I really want to play it. Too bad a Wii U still costs like $300 for a preowned one.
Was I one of the only Wii U owners to not own Nintendo land
What no love for Snail SMS, hang/safari hunt or Astro worriers.? Was Pong its known pack in?
It should be known, the scientific name for the shape of the salt is a ‘Scottagon’.
No mention of Playstation Demo One disk?
The re-watch value on Scott's videos are incredibly high Idk how many times I've watched this in the month its been out  Either that or I need more hobbies
The Kinect Adventures' boat minigame is sooooo nostalgic.  And I have never had an Xbox...
This video is so Malstrom 101
My switch came with has been heroes, also I genuinely loved astros playroom and the gimmicks with the ps5 controller
i got the lego game psvita i was very cool
YouTube commercials just keep getting longer and longer and louder and louder
All the ways Scott can be pissed off at the Wii Mini -The door opens up.  -No GameCube. -It doesn't take up enough room. -Not Small Enough. -I don't like red. -It looks like a clam. -The word "Mini" is insulting towards the word "small" -I don't like the Wii Mini. -I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. -I lost it under my couch. -I lost it over my couch.  -I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. -Too many letters in the name. -Too much value. -My wife left me for one. -My second wife just left me. -If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. -Doesn't catch fish. -Uses power. -Can't palm it like a basketball. -Can't palm it like a football -Does NOT go well on toast. -Does not fit in shoes. -Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. -Has never tipped well at restaraunts. -Treats service workers poorly. -Treats itself even worse.
Everytime I think of the Rob robot I think of the AVGN episode wish rob had more games it’s a neat concept
Loser, I got my 3DS with new super Mario bros 2… Yeah that basically means I got no game to
The waffle House has found its new host
Pack in games are something I totally took for granted back in the 80s. From about the ColecoVision on, we just always expected that a console was always going to ship with a game included.
Bummed you didn't mention the Master Chief Collection when it came bundled with the Xbox S. Fantastic addition
19:15 I like how he had the “not for resale” games for the future video about games that were not for resale 😂
Controversial, I looooooooove Nintendo land, especially takamarus ninja castle
Baseball was a stupid choice, it's a game for Americans like the handball game that you morons call football.... the rest of wii sports was a good choice
21:56 No single player?!? What about the rank climbing?!? What about Matt?!?
Keep in mind, Playroom VR ended up spawning the full game that was Astro’s Rescue Mission. It is entirely possible Astro’s Playroom could get the same treatment.
Nintendoland > Wii Sports
18:08 Does anyone here know who this girl is?
Of course you would make a 30 minute video about plastic paired with plastic
This gives context to what Scott was doing in the Spyro video by Caddicarus.
16:17 The headline for "the article from 1934." "This was before stars were invented." 😄😄😄
9:16 No! She was so young!!😱😭"
My NES came with Mario, Duck Hunt, and Track and Field all 3 on the same cart and a big roll out mat that you stomp on to make the dudes run. Lol
I got the Wii U with Windwaker as a bundle. I know the Wii U wasn’t that good but hey I had fun with it
Streetpass was one of the best features I’ve ever seen in a console. It was amazing just going out to malls or other places and seeing all of the other people that were there.
The PlayStation 5 was my first PlayStation (I mean my dad had a ps2 but I never really played it) and honestly all the PlayStation references were so cool. Feels like an introduction to the “PlayStation world” you know
Issues aside I absolutely love nintendoland. My buddy and I stayed up late at sleepovers many nights screwing around with that game and trying to beat every single mini game. The Zelda and Metroid games stick out in my memory particularly. We had a ton of fun with it
15:18
I learned so much ;(
1 2 Switch seems like it could've worked better as a Warioware spinoff. Pack it with personality, and give us Wario trying to get away with making a quick buck as usual, and it would be remembered better.  Warioware didn't die to Snapped, it'd have been fine

Just learned that the Wii Mini does NOT go well on toast, thanks.
I love the list of reasons why Scott doesn't like the Wii Mini:  The door opens up No Gamecube It doesn't take enough room Not small enough I don't like red It looks like a clam The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "Small" I don't like the Wii Mini I put marinara sause in it and it stopped working I lost it under my couch I lost it over my couch I like red so much it distracts me from the videogames Too many letter i's in the name Too much value My wife left me for one My second wife just left me If it had eyes, it would have stink ones Doesn't catch fish Uses power Can't palm it like a basketball Can't palm it like a football Does NOT go well on toast Does not fit in shoes Doesn't last long enough in the microwave Has never tipped well at restaurants Treats service workers poorly Treats itself even worse
When the DS first came out, Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt was the only game we all had for it so we tended to play a lot of 4 player deathmatch at lunch and after school in-between Halo matches. Good times. It was dirt cheap on eBay few years back so I bought 6 copies for roughly a dollar total and revisited it with some of my friends recently. It's still pretty fun.
For me sports champion earns a 3 , It is meant to look like Wii sports but It blew my mind how much better the motion controls are. I never went back to Wii sport after that. And then I never went back on sports champion because motion controls are just a gimmick and I just played regular games on a regular controller.
I would count Wii Play as a pack-in for the extra controller.
There use to be this guy where I live and at his game store he would sell the switch at $240
i got a good few years of playtime with wii sports. that and guitar hero 3 were the *only* games my mom ever got for the system.  not too sure why, we had it for well over a decade. it eventually just became a way to watch netflix even when i was old enough to play more complex titles
bruh
1,2 switch was one of my worst gaming experiences and made me think of selling my switch. Unfortunately I borrowed it and had to return it so I wasn't able to burn it.
14:07 Shooting Range isn't on the list? Also how did I go my whole life without knowing what Gumshoe was?
You forgot Welcome Park, pre installed game on the Vita similar to 3DS Face Raiders
the fuckin duh for Wii sports got me
There was another game that required the Zapper: "To The Earth". It was insanely hard and took a lot of skill and stamina to get through it. And honestly, The Lone Ranger didn't REQUIRE the Zapper - it was merely an option, like in Bayou Billy.
The face raiders noise that plays when you hover over it on the menu haunted me when i was younger
My ds xl came packed in with Mario kart ds! Great pack in!
Actually Scott my 3ds came bundled with ocarina of time!
1, 2 Switch is mediocre for about 28 minutes if you have friends irl to play with.   That’s the nicest thing I can say about it.
Heeeey why the diss on Face Raiders? I loved that game as a kid
Well, Astro was a pack in for PSVR
Takes me back to christmas 2017 where i got a switch and no games so i had to wait until the next day so i could get breath of the wild so i spent all of christmas making mii's
I avoided the Wii U because of the second screen game pad
God, that line at 8:33 "It's like an abacus! This counts?" Absolutely killed me.
26:32 love how it doesnt mention the lack of internet connection
One thing too, I think 350 dollars for Nintendo land and the console was a bad play. If they had premiered with a $300 dollar bundle with the game as the only option I think the Wii U might have sold better. Eliminate consumer confusion and force consumers to try out Nintendo land to see everything the game pad could do.
What about the NES pack in w/ Mario & Track & Field ?????
Ngl I LOVED Gladiator Duel in sports champions and also the disc gold. It was fun
I miss pack in games
Do you think among us as a pack in title for the Wii U would be the Wii sports moment for Wii U?
0:43, LOL, I don’t think I ever played that Nintendo Land, I still have the Uncharted that came with my ps4 in the plastic wrap.
I love the way Scott briefly turns into a 90’s commercial voiceover guy when he says “Mario Kart Wii is such a *powerful pack-in!”* 🔥😎🔥 at 26:36
I miss the old ending song. But the new song is a mad banger. Thanks Scott, when you replace it I'm sure I'll miss it just the same hahaha
I remember my WiiU came with Nintendo Land and Mario 3D World. It had the full art which looked amazing and I really enjoyed Nintendo Land. It's what I think Super Nintendo World should be.
26:31 the effort this man puts in 😂
Sonic is still my favorite pack in of all time, but Astros playroom is a close second. That game was a blast, and really showed off what the Dual sense can do. I just wish there was a physical version of it in some form or another. Hopefully they make a proper full-fledged sequel to it
The only Kinect supported thing that was pretty cool and probably the only thing worth buying/Using it was the Boss Mode in Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare
Plus, N64 games brand new when the system itself was new were $70…in the mid 90’s!
The first day we got our 360, it malfunctioned and shredded Kinect adventures. It didn't want us to play it.
If only I had watched this video in 2014 so I wouldn't have wrongly assumed my Smash Bros. design 3ds had a pack in
No mention at all of Starwing / Star Fox as a pack in game for the SNES?
Love your videos! Great comtent!
Great video, but no discussion on the Sega Master System's two separate launch pack-ins (Hang-On/Safari Hunt and Hang-On/Astro Warrior)?
Nintendo land was peak
I remember the kinect and kinect adventures...... the game was cool, but it it was ass when it comes down to detecting if you're there or not and your motion and movement. Even with a lot of space the game didn't respond well at times, especially if it's you and 4 other people and had a lot of spacd or at least enough. The kinect was cool though, and 1 game I remember playing a lot as a kid was the gunstringer. That was my favorite game on the kinect and I think it's underrated since it's covered by the problems the kinect had. The kinect wasn't all bad, it had some hidden gems, and putting fruit ninja on the kinect was perfect
personally Kinect adventures was a good game to my 7 year old in 2013 so was Kinectimals
Dude, we STILL bust out Wii Sports when the family's all together.
0:32 what i need to say
The master chief collection was the reason I got an Xbox One, surprised that wasn't mentioned.
I loved Kinect Sports so much
Astro's Playroom made me think of Nintendoland a lot when I played it. I hope Sony has a sequel made and I hope Nintendo revisits the Nintendoland concept with maybe more of a single player focus like Astro's Playroom.
What I’ve learned from this video: The Wii Mini is a womanizer and an asshole to service workers.
7:17 Scott take your pizza out of the oven!!!
Funnily enough, I was gifted Kinect Adventures with a new Xbox 360 from my grandmother. The only game we ever got for the system and played it endlessly. Family and friends loved it.
"i lost it over my couch" lmfao
Sonic 2 was a pack-in with the Model 2 Genesis. And I’m pretty sure they packed Sonic 3 in with either the 2 or Model 3.
I fuckin love gladiator combat and I'm glad someone has finally acknowledged it as the masterpiece it is
A moment of silence to Scott Wozniak, who lost two of his wives to the Wii Mini.
20:21 Made me laugh out loud in a bus.
diddy kong racing was a pack in for n64 at one point
I’ve rewatched this video a few times and I ALWAYS manage to catch the little deviants bit while I’m eating 😭😭🤢
Woah isn’t this the guy who owns sonic Jam?
Holy Fuck it's Scott the Woz
I THINK I SEE AN 19:44 BY THE TREE
26:32 do yourself a favor a pause it to read the complaints about the Wii Mini, it's probably the funniest part of the whole video. and it's a funny video in its own right.
Every system should be sold with a game otherwise it's useless
Scott forgetting Child of Eden was also packed in with the Kinect.
The pack in for my Wii U was Mario Kart flipping 8  I've never owned nintendo land lol
You should play Astro bot rescue mission, that game is REALLY good, and has well built in features.
My biggest problem with Nintendo Land is that I don't have any friends
What did I learn from this video?     The Wii mini launched during my freshman year of high school. I don't even remember seeing it in stores
“Retailing at $50 by itself, that’s dick move.”
Wasn't Super Mario 64 DS included with the Blue DS?
I was today years old when I learned the ps vita had a back touchpad
Scott missed the pack in for the PlayStation TV. (The consolized Vita). Came with the Lego movie game. Pretty awesome for a $99 system.
Scott and his retro games never fail to make me laugh :)
through this whole video I could not tell if the pack in scale was better with more white or black and tbh I wouldn't have it any other way
My ps5 came with God of War so I didn't play whatever goofy thing that was, but now I want to play it.
9:18 this jokes kills me.
No chuchu rocket? I thought Scott only reviewed dead consoles
Scott held a freaking wet rat twice, what's next?
Wait, why is there a Nintendo land in my Wii U console
I actively love altered beast and play it.
The only thing the Wii U was good for, was to prove that people really just wanted a Switch.
I think they included New Super Mario Bros with the Wii mini in Europe
16:10 POV : Atari flipping you off
NGL I immediately uninstalled Astros playroom before even touching it
Man 17:16 sounds real bad out of context
Playstation 2 slim + happy feet was the shit
Boy, not a lot of people outside the US know the rules of baseball.
I hated this on N64. Had one, but never had a cartdrige.
I went a bought a wii just so I could play wii sport with my family
Astro's Playroom for PS5 was... Good? Which feels weird. It's a good game.
I thought face raiders was fun but I’m simple
I was honestly hoping for Scott to mention the Translucent Forest Green N64 that had DK64 as a pack-in.
The thing that always bothered me about Wii Sports is... It is everything you say it is. It's low on content, it's just a pack-in, and that's all okay, it doesn't need to be more than that. But then, Nintendo still had the gall to brag triumphantly about how many copies it sold and how it was the best selling Wii game. It came with the console, literally everyone who owned the console had no choice but to own the game, so obviously that was going to be the case. But when they made that announcement, they just seemed so proud, like Wii Sports was this triumph of gaming and proof that all that people wanted were casual games.
Most of the time pack-in games really feel like they exemplify the console as a whole if done right. (or in the case of the Wii U and vita wrong)
So excited for the annual rotation of Scott’s profile picture to finish :)
This man could make wet cardboard interesting
Nice I miss pack in game
The only good thing about the Vita back touchpad is the ability to map sections of it to buttons that aren't on the Vita but are on PlayStation home consoles.
I still can't believe Konami never made a Yu-Gi-Oh game using the 3DS AR Cards technology. THE SERIES WAS ALMOST DESIGNED FOR THIS.
Is Dinosaur Runner a pack-in for Google Chrome?  Best part of any internet outage.
I bought a used Japanese Dragon Quest 3DS off eBay and even that came with a set of AR cards
26:33 this joke is a masterpiece, if you don't pause it at the right time the joke works, but if you do works even better lol
What???? My whole life I thought SM64DS came bundled in with the DS? Am I tripping?
This man's one of the most hilarious human on planet earth. Perfect humour: witty, but not too dry. Truly amazing.
Astro’s playroom was a very short title because unless you were new to all playstation had backwards compatibility with ps4 games.
What about Atari pong or pac man pack in?
I really loved Sports Champions. The bocce was so much fun that I bought an actual bocce ball set, and the table tennis was so good that I actually got better IRL from playing it! Deadmund's Quest was also cute, basically took the mechanics of Sports Champions and turned it into an actual game.
Xbox and Halo have done this pretty well over the journey
did the colecovision have a pack in title?,, i can't remember,, also my snes has sf2 as the pack in title.
DK country could been a great pack in title
Hey Scott U forgot the SNES Jr./Mini that came with Tetris Attack exculsivelly with Geffery the Giraffa!!!
paused the video at 26:33 to read these and laughed much harder than i thought I would have
8:03 Scott sounds like a 90's game advertiser.
3DS's Face raiders is very dear to me. Not that I played it that much, but I made all my friends try it. It has my friends' faces from a decade ago. All those who were close to me at the time. Some I still keep in touch with, some I don't. It reminds me of a simpler and happier time of just me and my friends, playing 3DS.
beef
The fast scrolling text had me laughing so bad 😂😂 “I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working” or “My wife left me for it” LMAO
sorry about ur gma
To be fair, ROB worked at the time. It came off of the video game crash, so Nintendo marketed it as a toy to get people to buy it. They were probably worried people would be afraid of a video game console.
This video is good and all, but I have no idea why you would give Super Mario Bros./Duck Hunt zero stars.
Marinara sauce in the Wii mini? Oh hell, and I thought salsa would’ve done worse
16:17 holy crap it’s adult Wateru.
Nice
Two years ago, my wife got the Animal Crossing exclusive Switch for Christmas, and we were absolutely flabbergasted that it didn't come with the game. It was just a recolored Switch. I was so convinced that we were wrong and had just missed the game or a digital code somewhere that I spent an hour scouring over every inch of the box.
Scott always makes the most interesting videos. He’s genuinely such a talented guy!
My Super Nintendo pack in was the Super Game Boy. Did anyone else get this one?
Don’t you dare talk shit about PlayStation move sports😤, some of us never had a wii😢
Thought of taking testosterone for that voice? It's way too whiney for youtube.
Slight remark here: "everybody" knows baseball if "everybody" is Japan and the USA.
Metroid Prime Hunt wasn't so bad
5:45  Oh no, online flash games are better than this cancer XD
This is how i learned the vita had a back touch pad
Scott wants to play Astro bot
23:26 Light on what?
26:32 That's unironically the funniest list i've ever read in my life lmfaooooo
Where was the joke about PSP's pack-in game being Spider-Man?
26:12 I spat my drink out. 😂😂😂
16:18 "Who!?" -Guardians of the Galaxy  😂😂😂
Lol Scott said wii sports had basic  graphics..  The Atari 2600 would like a word with you Scott.  🙂
Nintendo Land fucking slapped
i had the think before you said it. dude you can look serious...
Scotts complains about PS5 graphics but praises wiiu graphics ! We know you a Nintendo fan but hot damn
1 2 switch sucked, didn't even have a real menu
Man, the kinect was awesome. Just not for games. Its ability to scan the environment in 3D in an affordable package breathed life to so many cool projects. As a game console peripheral, it was hot garbage.
I remember buying the Gamecube and the store gave me the option of Resident Evil 0 orMetriod Prime and the original PS3(500 gigs) with MGS4 GOTP.
Scott is completely underrated. So much effort is put into each video it astounds me. Every person who works on this channel is doing a great job and I hope they're proud of themselves. Another great video, thank you!
I feel like the pack in for the Wii Mini shouldn't have changed. Wii Sports Resort seems *perfect* for the Wii Mini, seeing as the Wii Mini's target audience seemed to be "The last few grandparents that didn't own a Wii"
can you say hi to my friend amy
The Wii mini had no pack in games at all when it first launched in Canada, what a great way to launch the first always offline Wii console!
I would have liked to have seen more systems from the classic era included - like the Intellivision and its Las Vegas Poker & Black Jack pack-in.
Nintendo land metro mini game went hard me and my friends would play it over cod😂
The pack-ins made the system back in the '80s and early '90s.  Super Mario Brothers was a must-play that showed the NES' superiority over other systems, especially the omnipresent but aging Atari 2600.  IIRC the NES later came with SMB3, which showed how the then-older system was capable of holding its own and making the original SMB look primitive.  My favorite memory of a pack-in/bundle was getting my SNES.  Super Mario World was of course part of the package, but Super Mario All-Stars was offered for free as a mail-in.  By the time I opened my Christmas present in '92 or '93 I realized I had not only the newest Mario game out, but also updated versions of four others, one of which had never seen a US release (the original SMB2, or Lost Levels over here).
Has Scott covered Cereal Box games?
I'll not accept Altered Beast slander
there were 16 that used the zapper..  there were still only 2 that used the robot, and 1 wasn't a game and Gyromite was easier to play with controller 2 by using your toes.
Did you forget the pack in demo disc with the domino, sculpture, and samurai demo on the move?
You completely missed the Sega GT 2002/Jet Set Radio Future pack-in that came with the original Xbox. I spent countless hours of my teenage years playing those two. IMHO it was one some of the most fun I've had on an Xbox apart from 007: Nightfire split screen with my neighbor
hehe i remember we got our first console the snes and it came with Donkey Kong Country... i was like 5 years old and my first video game experience.... it's 2022 now and it's still an amazingly fun game to play <3
I loved Face Raiders. I remember getting to the last boss and couldn’t get past him
Maybe also worth noting is the Snail maze game that came on the Sega Master System.  It’s stored on the console itself, so you can play something if you don’t have any cartridges. It’s pretty simple but pretty cool that it’s built-in. Later revisions included an Alex Kidd game instead.
Well he did when is the L button episode
1 2 switch should have been tweaked a little to make it more fun, the minigames should have been quicker, should have been a packin, and make it a warioware game
Scott I will streetpass you
I kept the ps3 sports pack-in and I still play it from time to time.
11:19 No items, Final Destination, Fox only.  😃😃
Some things are worth fight for Scott
I legit had no idea the wii mini existed until this video
So glad Astro is getting some love. Ps2 for me was the best home for non Nintendo 3D collectathons so for them to kickoff the ps5 with Astro was a true gift.
One of the best pack-in titles I've ever play was MechAssault for the original Xbox. I played the heck out of that game both online and through the story campaign, probably pulling every hour I possibly could out of it. Good times were had!
Nintendo Land was one of my favorite games as a kid lmao. The luigi mansion game was absolutely goated to play with friends. Still have very fond memories of some of the other multiplayer minigames as well.
22:16 Hey Scott, your Pizza is ready
7:17 is my favorite gag yet
The PlayStation 5 actually exists??? I still have yet to see one.
The title of this video should have just been: “I love Nintendoland; let’s talk about it in its entirety!”
Also, Wii Sports is a great showcase of the Miis !
When I got my 3DS the first face I scanned so I could play Face Raiders was the woman from the TV mag cover. I never figured out how to change it so to this day this woman is trapped in my console!
Surprised he didn’t mention that the Wii U pack-in game was originally gonna be Game & Wario before it was replaced by Nintendo Land.
One of the later packages of the Model 2 Genesis came with Sonic 3 and Sub-Terrania. Debatably the best and worst Genesis games. Both games definitely showcase the Genesis' unique sound font, though.
Great video Wozza! Made me so hard.
Scott you are a perfect man
Pls dont have a heart attack
The woman on the cover of 1-2 Switch is Grey Griffin, or as she's better known, Princess Azula.
If you want to read the Wii mini Gag its 26:33 (trust me it's worth reading) 26:32 if you want a second to pause it.
Sega Master System 2 was ahead of its time coming with a built in game on the system. Alex Kidd in Miracle World.  I got mario kart 8 as my game for the nswitch.
I can’t tell you how many school day afternoons were spent in the man cave playing Nintendoland against each other with my friends and all of my older brothers friends. It was such a unique time
Im no one, but....    stick to the 20-30 min format
I remember getting a Gameboy and it had Tetris, I really wanted more of a platformer game so I bought Yoshi thinking hey this game will be fun and like Mario. one of my bigger disapointments as a child and it taught me to read the box before you buy the game.
Wii sports and Astro boy are my favorite pack in titles
I remember loving Altered Beast, at the time when it came out it was the upgrades you character got that set the game apart something about turning into a dragon was so exciting back then.
Not gonna lie, I'm so confused by how scott did the ratings here. White being the negative space and black being the actual rating is such a weird choice that I would assume it was a mistake
It's a basic platformer at the end of the day? Well, what about the other times of the day?
"So is Settings" LOL
I swear this guy could make a video about console wires and get 5 mil
Scott you forgot Gex as the 3DO pack in
I actually got two pack-ins when I bought my Xbox 360 with Kinect. When the clerk checked if Kinect Adventures was in the box, he didn't find it, so he just threw a copy of Disneyland Adventures.   Turns out that Kinect Adventures was there, just very well hidden for some reason.
yherfhu
Honestly I found nintendoland more fun than wii sports luigis mansion and metroid are brilliant
I feel like a good nintendo game that would have been better at showing off the consoles are the warioware games. All of them are made to use the consoles capabilities from the few I've played. Not to also mention how they basiclly released a new one whenever a new version of the DS came out.
:3
You gotta clean your cartridges if you're putting them on camera
All of those games you mentioned on the VCS were released 4 years after its release in 1977 and didn't even exist in the arcade.  Unfair score and review, Combat was a great fun innovative game in its day 😡
What is going on with Scotty’s disgusting fingernails? Pedicure much?
It's so sad that Scott forgot to tell everyone about the best pack-in game of all time : Sega Master System's Snail Maze.
Day 121 of trying to get Scott to heart my comment
My friend group has found nearly thousands of hours playing Nintendo Land.  We just wish there were more multiplayer games in it.  We have 100% most of the games.  The master modes are so brutal.
Ya I’m picky about my pack in. Think almost better with  out pack in.  And I’m cheap only like near Christmas time.
It's a shame you glossed over 3ds' Streepass games. They were the absolute constant for me for years. It really felt like I was in a community of fellow secret gamers, racking up almost 4k hits!
Would’ve loved to see his take on the Xbox bundle with Jet Set Radio Future and Sega GT 2002
Astro VR is what you want.
No crossbow training? Unsubbed
I cry foul, stars were used for ratings as early as 1844. Nice video though.
7:17 oh god "The Day of the Clown"!! X,D ...I wonder if it's the day the clown cried
i like how the videos sound like he is reading a high school essay and while it is kinda lame, it is so relatable. i cant stop watching
takes me 3 days to get 30 views, takes 3 days for Wot the Scozz to get 811,000
Scott should make a full video just on streetpass and streetpass functionalities, it was really cool and it'd be cool if he could experience even some of what made it so cool
0:54 Jokes aside, for Activision ots pretty good game actually
Ah yes Scat's 750th time talking about wii sports
I am so glad you talked about the greatness of the PlayStation Sports gladiator game. I played that so much on Christmas Day 2010 that I was sore the next day
man that score rating is confused af
Altered beast is bad ass
11:55
can you make a video on cereal box toys
honestly scott has done so much on the wii u that he could pack together all his little snippets about it and still get a worthy documentary
What about aperture desk job? I know it wasn't designed for a "real" console, but it feels like a pack in title.
would be cool to see a video on nintendo's history with the internet and online connectivity
1 2 Switch should have been a pack in game. I will never buy it ever
Everyone seems to LOVE Astro's Playroom.  It is truly a shame that we haven't gotten a full big game based on it as it could really be amazing!
Uses power 🤣
Scott: shows the Nintendo Mario/Duck Hunt and Sega Sonic versions  Me, an 80s child: yes, the iconic pack-ins    Scott: the best example is wii sports    Me: wait. that’s illegal
thank you scott for being the second person on earth who acknowledges sports champions gladiator mini game
"I don't like Nintendo I like having a big, stinky crotch"
Honestly, if Tearaway was released earlier it would have been the perfect pack-in game. It does a much better job of showing off the vita than Little Deviants ever could.
12:50 up until you said $60 I was thinking , “actually this works well as a pack in- ITS SEPARATE? *$60?* “Now I understand. i understand…
Nintendo Land on Wii U is the game me and my family probably have the most hours in on Wii U than any other game that isn't called Super Mario 3D Land or Mario Kart 8...which is depressing because it just reminds me how few Wii U games there are that made use of the system's hardware, sad...
Wheres my xbox 360 pack in hexic HD?
My NES came with Super Mario Bros 3. My Sega Genesis came with Sonic 3 and Sonic & Knuckles. So color both me and my dad surprised when I opened up a brand new N64 on Christmas Morning only to discover it came with no game. How could that be? Both my NES and Genesis came with games. Well, yeah, because they were at the end of their life cycle at that point so they had pack-ins to encourage sales, I later found out. This was 1997 when the N64 was still new. And because this was 1997 and stores were still closed on Christmas back then, I had a brand new N64 I couldn’t even play on Christmas. I had to wait until the next day so my dad could drive me to Sears and pick out my very first N64 game - Star Fox, which itself came with its own pack-in in the form of the Rumble Pak.
My 3ds never came with ar cards so i never got to experience that
I sure hope Scott remembered to take the pizza out of the oven.
I rented gyromite as a kid they didn’t include the robot. This should be considered a crime.
"Would you rather be shot for free? Or for 50 dollars?" -Scott asking the hard-hitting questions.
My nephew who is 4 plays the hell out of Nintendo land, especially the pikmin game. He's obsessed.
Do you think I can convince grandma to play a mini game based on Pikmin? Well I can’t shes dead 💀 OMG 😭😭🤣🤣🤣
IF the wiiu had gc backwards compatibility still it would have been fantastic. I still liked it ultimately though.
Wtf happened to your nails
Switch also has a Mario kart bundled in this Black Friday. Don’t know if that counts?
Yo
Great 👍
astro's playroom managed to give me nostalgia for a time I haven't lived just through it's music
wow wee i love my wii sport bowlding
Altered beast; alter me.
Another amazing video
Who writes your scripts! Hilarious! Great work!
This is episode 244. I bet the next episode will be a 10 year wii u retrospective Christmas special as alluded to at the end of his Halloween special, and will be episode 245, ending season 6 of Scott the Woz.
No Xbox pack-ins? come on Halo, and also the vita got another pack-in title in COD.
unfair platformer
7:33 how did you hurt your thumbs like that?
'Nintendoland' - Schlatt 2022
BTW 1,2 switch was a pack in in my country.
No mention of Alex Kidd on Master System
Who else paused the video to read the comments aboug the Wii Mini
2:45 A.K.A. KNEE SLAPS
Scott, cut your hangnails buddy. I love you stuff and want your fingers to not suffer.
my parents rlly bought the white wii u and nintendo land separately... no judgement but the deluxe set was right there
Just miss the old outro
Astro’s Playroom is a beautifully crafted game, it gets a rare 10/10 from me. It’s short but all killer, no filler 🥰
Nintendo land looks awesome, I would like if they brought it to the Switch
ALL 3DS came with AR cards?? Immune sure as hell didn’t! (I probably missed them)
As a proud PSVita owner I came here to say that you forgot about preinstalled Welcome Park game. Redo the video
Nintendo Land is the only way you should buy the WiiU
Okay
Kinect was amazing back in the day... like it introduced my family to video games
This video slayed
Lord please let me be able to get my kids this for Christmas and everything they deserve please lord
Either you live long enough to get married and put these in storage. Or you double your collection and continue to keep it on the wall
No Alex Kidd for the Master System? :/
Over in Europe, where we all played home micros, a new computer would come 3, 4 or even 5 games.  One time Atari made an Atari ST bundle with 20 games included free.  It was a big seller, but since all the new users were busy with their 20 game bundle, nobody bought any new software so Atari accidentally tanked their own software market.  Typical Atari.
4:49 relatable
I don't know why we are not paying for his videos. They're so good!
＼⁠(⁠^⁠o⁠^⁠)⁠／
"I'm done trying"   Sounds like my life
i played gladiator battle for hours, what a fucking great game. so glad to see it get love
Blimey... astro's playroom is being rivaled by... AR games?
I’m convinced that minecraft could be the validator for the game pad if it had multiplayer with a player on the gamepad
Wait, you don't like red? But... you also like red so much, is distracting?
how long till we run out of scott the woz video topics
Mrs. the Woz left Scott for a Wii mini
Face Raiders terrified me, so I put it in the farthest corner possible
My favorite pack-in; Killer instinct!  By far
Bro I loved gladiator on the ps3 man I literally played that game so much
To be honest, I just assumed that 1-2 Switch was a pack-in title. I felt ripped off when my Switch didn't come with any games 😂
The amount of time you spend off camera setting up for a 5 second gag is stupidly impressive 😂
23:56
Nintendo Land was good man
I miss pack in games
I got the Switch Tennis Aces bundle that included 1-2 Switch. As a free bonus it was a cool little thing that my girlfriend and I fired up a half dozen or so times. If it hadn't come with Tennis Aces as well it would have been a real let down though.
how much weed do you smoke a day big killa scott
I was *almost* 6 years old when my dad got me a NES. We played Duck Hunt for 5 minutes, completely confused. Are we the duck? Are we supposed to shoot somehow?  *"I'm not sure son, let's check the manual. Oh hey, a gun!"*  One of my favorite memories of that old geezer.
sorry about your grandma
I can’t believe I’m saying this but Nintendoland’s graphics and lighting still hold up after 10 years.
I was an artist alley seller at anime cons back when Street Pass was at its height, and MY GOD. It was fun if you were in THAT kind of situation. My Mii plaza literally has over 3,000 Miis in it and I completed every single puzzle board in ONE con. My artist friends would list our table spots in our Street Pass greeting, too, for a little marketing during the con.   Those were some fun times.
I hate shipping prices as buying and it would be 100 over the pond for something in america that would be only 40-50 pound
You should change your outro music back to the og one 👍🏻
Nintendo Land tried to be the Wii U's Wii sports but really ended up being the Wii U's Wii Play
I was just chilling, watching the video as normal until 25:08, the game and the music played in the background, a theme i hadn't heard in years, it did bring a tear to my eye.
Scott is the best Nintendo Tuber by a long shot
God, during the 1980s and early 1990s, the benchmark for  games at home was comparing them to the arcades, with their playability and, of course, graphics... I mean unless you and a shitload of memory and the fastest CPU (they were all slow!) _then_ you could get close to the arcade style. Well, that, or you already had a shitload of cash and could afford the NeoGeo at £100 to £200+ a game!?!? 🤔😬 Great to play, but if you were a kid that WASN'T spoilt, you were getting a game twice a year (birthday and Christmas) and that was IT! My mate, on the other hand, WAS spoilt. And had loads of games for his NeoGeo. And his Atari Jaguar. And his SNES. And his Saturn. And his MegaDrive and Master System. And his Atari Lynx. And his CDTV(!). And his Amiga CD32. And his Sega GameGear. And his GameBoy. Phew! AND his NES! 🤔 Yup, he basically had them ALL! Yes, including a fucking Amiga 600 and Atari ST. Lucky bastard. Except... He had a knack of choosing THE WORST games to buy! So, most of the time, regardless of how many cool systems he had, he had the least playable games! And you really wouldn't want to play them! Aaaargh! An awful judge of games he was! Damien, you liked some shit games my friend! 😊
Bocce ball on PS Move convinced my family to buy real bocce balls
Scott mr beast is in fortnite
Yup, Wii Sports was DEFINITELY a Nintendo seller! I mean, christ, my mum and sister bought themselves a Wii just to play it because they thought they'd get some sort of fun exercise out of it!?! 😊 🤔 And... They actually DID!  ✌🏼😀👍🏼 Never before had my middle aged sister and my elderly mother EVER played a computer/console game. EVER! And I've had computers and consoles since the mid 1980s! So, them buying a Nintendo JUST to play that ONE game, Wii Sports! Yeah, it definitely was a great pack-in title! 😊 Monumentous really!
I can't believe Scott forgot about the Super Mario Bros. + Duck Hunt + World Class Track Meet combo cartridge -_- It's a sad day
Even though Keith Courage in Alpha Zones is an incredible punchline, I can't help but want to know more about a game like that
26:31 fast word hard to read, here you go "The door opens up.  No GameCube.  It doesn't take up enough room.  Not small enough.  I don't like red.  It looks like a clam.  The word 'mini' is insulting to the word 'small'  I don't like the Wii Mini.  I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working.  I lost it under my couch.  I lost it over my couch.  I like red so much it distracts me from the video games.  Too many letter i's in the name.  Too much value.  My wife left me for one.  My second wife just left me.  If it had eyes, it would have stink ones.  Doesn't catch fish.  Uses power.  Can't palm it like a basketball.  Can't palm it like a football.  Does NOT go well on toast.  Does not fit in shoes.  Doesn't last long enough in the microwave.  Has never tipped well at restaurants.  Treats service workers poorly.  Treats itself even worse."
My mate had nothing but the mario duck hunt pack in from Christmas to his birthday 8mths later. He was so good at those two games.
Can someone remind me what Sonic song that is playing when he starts talking about Altered Beast at 20:23? I got it stuck in my head now lol please and thank you. Great video btw Scott!
I got a Wii U when I was 10 and it was my first introduction to gaming.  For the most part I could understand the minigame concepts
sega superstars tennis + XBLA anthology will always be my favourite pack in game, mostly because the xbox 360 was the first console i remember unpacking and spent a lot of time with it
My favorite packing game New Super Mario Bros U on Wii U, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on Switch, Mario Kart 7 on 2DS, Genesis 6 Pak on 2nd Model Genesis, Gate of Thunder on TurboDuo and Namco Museum Vol. 1 on PS1 was my own packing game on PS1
14:07 bayou billy used the zapper too
I think it might be a bit hard to imagine today just how _impressive_ Altered Beast was in its original context. At a time when the competition was still 8-bit, here you had an arcade-like experience with big characters, _huge_ bosses, epic music, real voice overs, a _ton_ of graphical effects, and it was all playable with two players to beat. The game certainly has its flaws--it's a bit shallow and very short--but it was sure something you just wouldn't see on a competing system.  A pack-in that wasn't mentioned here but I think is somewhat baffling is Virtua Fighter 1 for the Saturn. Sure, it was a great game and popular, but it really didn't do much to showcase the system.
Don't worry Scott, you're not the only one to lose your wife to a Wii Mini
I wasn't into wii sports I like wii play motion
1, 2, Switch is the Wii Play of the Switch. Made just for showing off the joycon´s features
Nintendo land is good tho
Anybody remember the launch DS Metroid demo? Edit: I wrote this before he got to that part. 😅
Scott you forgot the DS had Mario Kart as a pack in
Nintendo Land is wonderful.
You could also count "aperture desk job" as a kind of pack-in for the steam deck
I wholeheartedly believe Astro's Playroom is one of the best pack-ins since Mario World and Sonic 1.
My NES pack-in game also included World Class Track Meet in it...NES Power Set for the "W"!
I actually learned the rules of baseball from Wii Sports (I was six)
snes with mario all stars is the GOAT of console bundles
Impressed that you managed to get through a segment about 1, 2, Switch without mentioning Quick Draw, the only reason I even know the game. And of course, not even showing the clip of Hideo Kojima having the quickest draw of them all.
Why are their so many ads in this
SCOT MAKE  A VIDEO ABOUT PS VITA
What's better than opening up a video game console and finding out it comes with a free game? Not taxes!~
i always  thought face raiders got my father coughing in the background and made that the sound when you select the game
For some reason I remember Deca Sports, not because of it's gameplay oh no no!. Because it has a great soundtrack! like a cheap looking game like this has good soundtrack and you wanna know what else? The game is made by Hudson Soft the same guys who worked on the Mario party series up to 8, WTF!
Who else went back and paused to read the reasons to be mad at the Wii Mini?
I actually quite liked Nintendo land
i just got a ps5 yesterday i ended up getting it without a game luckly i got playstation plus that gave me a few ps5 games granted digital
When I got the 2600 Combat was the pack-in.
Y'know what, my neighbors had Nintendoland. I loved it! I remember our favorite mini game being the Luigi's Mansion one. We used to fight about who would be the searchers and the ghosts lol
Scott continues to impress me with how he can make anything interesting
Wasn’t halo ce a pack in title?
Sports what was the difference between the Wii and Wii Mini? EDIT: oh, no internet.
You always make my day, hopefully I see you in E3 2022
The AR cards barely worked for me. It was probably the lighting in my house
Love Astro's playroom
I swear to this day the greatest pack-in game was Jet Set Radio Future/Sega GT 2002 that came packed with some Xbox consoles in 2002-2003.
the level of over-excited fake hype and upbeat tomfoolery in your voice makes my skin crawl..why is this channel popular? 1.6 million subs? for what?
I got soo stuck playing astros playroom that I got the plantium on my first playthrough
You should make a video about vudeo games that didn’t need to be portable.
Funny thing is Tearaway SHOULD where little deviants is
Scott not owning a TG16
What a great video. So many good points made and shows how important and what an art pack in games are.
Awwh man, I was sure we'd see aperture laboratories on steam deck
Metroid prime hunters was the birth of my first gamertag.
This is Scott at his finest! 0:00
WORSE than not having anything to play is playing pack in but NO MEMORY CARD to save progress
Turbografx 16 looked down on once again. Shame.
I believe that Astro's Playroom could've been expanded the same way Nintendo expanded Snipperclips. You get a good taste of it packed in the console (or the joycon pair in the case of snipperclips) and then they could sell you an expanded upon version of it for extra money and extra fun (like Nintendo did with the Snipperclips plus physical release or the Snipperclips plus dlc on the eShop)
the fact that Nintendo land was included in the Wii U is kinda sad considering I went to my local GameStop the next day after getting my Wii U and got Nintendo land for 2 bucks
Thats why when i was a kid i was always buying the games before getting the consoles
Aperture Desk Job for the Steam Deck should have gotten a mention.   Sure, it wasn’t preinstalled. But is WAS developed specifically to show off the Steam Deck controls, is a free download and a really fun little game doubling as a tech showcase.
that Astro's playroom had something for the PS Vr with other mini games as well
If it had eyes, it would have stink ones.
Scott’s ability to continuously come up with new video essays about gaming is ridiculous
Astro's Playroom feels like the next eveloution of Little Big Planet.
He can go on about anything 😂
You didn't cover the best pack-in game of all time: the 3d space cadet pinball demo on my windows XP laptop
Drinking Game: Take a shot every time Scott says "Wii Sports: in this video. Take your time. I'll wait.
Truly one of the best “Scott The Woz Console Pack-In Games” videos of our generation
This guy should should have his own segment on a premium cable TV channel!
"if I bought a DS at laugh, this would have been a cool bonus.... I also would have been seven." ..... I withdraw any comment.
but astro does have a game :(
This man bothers me on a visceral level.
Shlatt is not gonna be happy about this...
* For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.   (Proverbs 1:32) * But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.   (Galatians 3:22) * For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.   (John 3:17)
Dude, your Turbografx-16 tease was so mean! Keith Courage is part of my childhood.
Aperture Desk Job would’ve been a great inclusion for this video. It’s a free Portal spinoff developed specifically to showcase the Steam Deck’s features.
8:10 Scott cant count to 96
Dude clean your game carts and use a fucking toothpick
I actually 100 percented Astro's Playroom.
He’s running dry on ideas or at lest he will be seen best we do it not than later
7:18 The pro strat is to stop before the Koopas but still on that platform so you can chase after the shell and get up to five more lives (two from the out-of-shell Koopas and two from their shells as well as one more if you have fast enough reflexes to jump on the shell after it bounces back.
Combat was our favorite as kids.
This new outro theme sucks.... it's garbage. Return old outro theme Scott!
Scott the Woz is so good, it surpassed freaking Transformers, a multi-million dollar franchise, on the trending list!
So I have a Wii U console, but it won’t take disks completely and will just spit them out, anyone have an idea to fix it or should I just get another console
Finally, Scott talks about NintendoLand
You not only get Sonic but you also get Sonic 2!
I never knew the psvita had a touchpad on the back, i thought it was just a cool design
It's okay wii mini. There is no need to project your struggles onto others like that. I promise life will get better.
Jesus loves you
I miss the street pass and mii plaza. It was so fun to go to anime conventions and end up with tons and tons of people visiting your plaza
The Atari ST and the Amiga both had awesome game bundles.
Wii Sports is STILL the GOAT
Scott using a wii like a paper plane might be my favorite jump cut😂
I decided to pause and read these stuff 26:33 lol
18:05 prob my favourite scott the woz joke
.... looking at this... I now wonder.... why was Donkey Kong Country the pack in for my Super Nintendo????
What's his obsession with Nintendo? GameCube were definitely the kids who got bullied when the system first came out. I love how Scott disses Zelda games unless he's talking about the GameCube or Wii, then Zelda is suddenly amazing
When I see a new Scott the woz vid “hey Scott all here”
I literally thought thaf the pack in scale was being painted in white, until I saw SMB1 being rated lol
For those wondering the possible reasons you could be pissed off at the Wii Mini: The door opens up. No Gamecube. It doesn't take up enough room. Not small enough. I don't like red. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter i's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me, If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long enough in the microwave Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
Is it time to congratulate Scott on becoming a father?
17:10 I'm a year older than you and I had a similar "Nintendo embarrassment" going around that time. I don't know why that is; I guess because Nintendo was technically marketed towards kids.
Scott is quotable to no end.
14:08 what was the criteria for NES games that require a zapper?  There were a lot more that had zapper compatibility than what are in that scene.
I think my N64 came with a guide to Mario 64. So I got to read about a game I couldn't play for a month before we got... Mario Kart.
But you can wind very easy by going weapon from bottom up to launch then act like enemy is pinata while in air
Nintendo land was such an incredible game, just as great as Wii Sports but sadly nowhere near as widely praised as Sports was. Mario chase and Luigi’s ghost mansion and the Zelda battle quest were the king of showing what the Wii U could do in multiplayer games
Galdiator dual was really fun
As we find bigger and bigger planets our solar system is no renamed Solartoids
The Tetris game play gave me a hernia
Damn that merchandise video really flopped this vid already has twice the views and it’s only been out for a day
I remember when I got my Xbox 360 it included this pack in game named Pure and I thought it was the worst game ever made and almost returned the Xbox.
26:32, heres all the excuses The door opens up No GameCube. It doesn't take enough room Not small enough. I don't like red It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small" I don't like the Wii Mini I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games Too many letter i's in he name. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
Bro Deca Sports went crazy, don't diss my boy like that. You could pick a specific team, play games that wasn't WiiSports and new stuff before Resorts came out, a real bang for your buck kind of game.
POV: the packing game for the gameboy is Legend of Zelda:  Gameboy unit sold: 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
Please make a dedicated rhythm heaven video
Love how scott says of all time
My very first home console game system I bought with my own money (on 12/2/2012) was the Black Deluxe Wii U with NintendoLand. I have no regrets buying it 10 years ago and making memories along the way! [Commented on 12/2/2022.]
what’s the game called at 19:20?? please i’ve been searching for years lol
I never got AR cards with my 3ds or maybe my parents thought they were adds
I swear to God every time I wanted to play AR cards, I had lost them within the first 3 hours of getting it. "I am pissed at this thing I don't own." Truly the perfect quote for me when it was 2013.
The abacus joke was incredible
19:06 Scott is becoming Caddy
Scott Is Genuinely Funny, He Comes Up With The Funniest Jokes Ever.
Mario Kart DS...
Wii Sports will always be the best pack-in game, no matter who I ask, whenever they have a Wii, I say that I will destroy them in Wii Sports Bowling
"My wife left me for a Wii Mini" comedy gold!
I see these as starter packs.
I was actually really happy that the PS5 got a pack in game. We honestly don't see that a lot anymore and Astro's Playroom was a great game that did an amazing job showing off the PS5.
C'mon Scott, where's the L Button video?
Funny story: I got a Wii U back when I was a kid, played dozens of games on it for around 5 years. I never even opened the Nintendo Land disk case.
fond memories of me and my friends in high school all bringing our 3ds to school so we could streetpass each other (the only streetpasses we ever got lmao) and then play find mii during study hall
Kung fu panda is a 11/10 game and I will defend that till I die

i will never accept nintendoland or astro's playroom slander
This guy could talk about the history of the Z-button and I’d click 0.5 seconds after I see it.
The Master System 2 came with Alex Kidd. As part of the console itself.
You forgot about the Sega Master System's built in Snail Maze game... Disappointed.
I was hoping he would talk about Welcome Park on Vita.
I was really confused what was going on with the pilotwings graphics at 1:56 until I realized there was a greenscreen in play here.
I remember gyromite.  That robot sucked.  It was so much easier to just have your brother press the second controller buttons for you.
Regardless of what everyone thinks of the Wii Mini itself you can't den that the low price point of $99.99 was great. The Same can be said for the 2DS bundles that Nintendo would sell for $109.99 CAD
Man, I played the SHIT out of Face Raiders when I was little
Ah cool, a great chance for info across the history of videos games, not just WiiU game chat again!  *Less than 3 mins in brings up the wiiu immediately*
I have a psvita, I use it frequently and like it, but I am still not convinced that the back touchpad is real.
Since you did the 2600, I was really looking forward to the Jaguar and Cybermorph. Also, no Virtual Boy and Mario Tennis? The game that kicked off the Mario Sports series?
#11 trending!?!?!? Wow scott!
I wish the Vita would've launched with Tearaway. That game shows off all the gimmicks very well and just feels solid.. but it kinda has pack-in energy. That alone would've improved Vita sales massively.
Like
JM thank you
Hi James abalos
This video was uploaded at 00:31 o clock
Is that facial hair I see? Dear God he's finally hitting puberty!
You're showing your age with your reaction to 'Combat'.  Multiplayer (the family sitting around the TV playing games *together*) was very much the focus of Atari marketing, so Combat was the perfect pack-in game.  If you didn't buy any extra titles (most of which, at system launch, also had multiplayer), you *had* to play with your family, which made buying a system the kids could use *together* very appealing and helped sell the system.
It took me a while to figure that more black spaces = higher score, rather than more white spaces being higher.
Good vid bro
Scott sniping my childhood and won't give Keith Courage the time of day.  Granted the game was shit but still.
#11 on Trending
I would be lying if I said I'm not disappointed you didn't mention JSRF and racing game that came with the original Xbox.
The nintendo switch had the best pack in titles. Real bangers
Day 118 of trying to get Scott to heart my comment
I STILL have my Xbox 360 with Kinect with Controllers in perfect condition with Lego Batman and Pure AND IT LOVE PURE the game is so much fun it was fun as a Kid and it's still suoer fun the game is absolutely amazing. Also I liked to play Kinect Adventures and other Kinect games with friwnds and family was so cool. ^^ would play them still but I have no room at all.
Scott, take out the pizza in about 15 minutes please
how the hell does he do it
I think the Steam Deck’s Aperture Desk Job should’ve been mentioned.
Face raiders was a fever dream you cant change mind
I can't wait to ask Scott if he'll acquire some non-Caucasian Companions for Christmas!
13:36 his mouth don't mouth
I used to work at a local video game store and for some reason we had multiple boxes of sealed copies of Kinect Adventures. No one wanted to buy them, so we tried giving them away with purchases for free and people still didn't want it.  We couldn't even steal the cases for other games because they were purple.
So why does Wii Sports Club look worse than the original? Better question to ask is: HOW!?
7:28 someone get this poor man some lotion.
Super Mario World is one of my least favorite Mario games. Way too easy. 40th replay? I could never. Takes way too long to get to anything worth my time. Mario 3 is better
I love Scott’s videos sm
26:32 hahaha
I remember Jet Set and GT racing on the OG Xbox as a pack in. They were so much fun
I've finally managed to beat sonic and knuckles I couldn't before because of that stupid sand level also I thought carnival games was actually alright
To be honest I don't consider little deviants to be a pack-in game. It feels more like a bundle. I'd say Welcome Park is more of a pack-in. Just basic tutorials but it had trophies lol
Played Gladiator Duel at a friends house and it blew me away. I wish Move had better software.
I can't wait for Scott to do a video about the best party flight racing and dogfighting game, my Sims Sky Heros on the Wii. I am dead serious, the gameplay is really fun if you have a Wii, buy it. Underrated
I do like that every time you see Scott play Tetris he’s doing very poorly lmao
Oh hecc... I've had my PS5 for almost a year, and I had no idea Astro's Playroom was a game. I thought it was some social app for kids' games or something, so I just removed it or hid it away from the menu. 😅😓
I didn't know my PS5 came with Astro's Playroom until Scott told me. Looks like I have a new platformer to play for a little while. Also, shoutout to Find Mii, the RPG pack-in (it was part of Streetpass Mii Plaza). It is completely possible, although a little tedious, to finish Find Mii without Streetpass.
( 2:05 ) "These helped you do SOMETHING with the systems until you finally got a good game."  *T H E  S H A D E*
Video 1 of asking Scott for the L button video
I love Scott the Woz.
Back in the day pack in games mattered. I picked a Genesis over a Super Nintendo because it came with Sonic. Don't regret that decision. 🙂
kung foo  pamdas pvp arena fighteermode  on 360 was way to good than it had any business being
You know, you should talk about the vita's history.
Have some chocolate 🍫 :)
7:15 tag urself i'm "Rome? In a day?"
Nintendo land was honestly pretty damn good for a pack-in title.
Did Scott just shoot a Hostage at 17:13?
i got alot of fun out of nintendoland. Respect that game!
My first console was a Sega Genesis bundled with Sonic 2. Even though I could never get past the second level without help from my sister, I spent countless hours on that game. That was when I was a little kid, and the game still stands up. I don't know if I would have become a lifelong gamer if I got it with Altered Beast or even Sonic 1.
It's so interesting to me that Wii Sports could easily be criticized for some of the same reasons as things like Kinect Adventures or Little Deviants: there's no depth, the graphics are basic, and what it does with the controls it's showing off is very basic. But I think Wii Sports succeeded where those other games failed for two reasons. First, using basic sports makes it feel like a game, not a tech demo. They didn't have to invent reasons to use the motion controls; they used something that people already wanted in games. Second, the Miis. It's easy to forget, but Miis were a very big deal at the time.
PS2 with dark cloud and red faction
i mean Wii Sports is the game you can still find in retirement homes in 2022 and like.. yeah it's pretty old game by now, watch out grandpa will riot!  but i think that's kinda genius and speaks to it's mass appeal, it's a game everyone can enjoy regardless of whether you're a gamer tm or just fetus or skeleboner
Slowed down the video just to read everything slowly for the problems of the Wii Mini, loved all the problems listed!
did Sony legitimately believe that Nintendo copyrighted golf and baseball?? like, why did they have bocce????
Hey all
Scott
are the points in black instead of white?? why????
I don’t know why I noticed that Scott has a cut under his right thumbnail
The fact he got a PSVita box and put a wet rat inside of it just for this joke is incredible.
Scott finna feel real dumb when that pumpkin goes D1 for football and then gets into the NFL. SCOTT DONT WANNA SEE THE DREAM
No shout out to the Sega Saturn 3 game pack-in CD sleeve versions of Virtua Fighter 2, Virtua Cop and Daytona USA?! INCOMPLETE! :P
Woz, no love for OG Xbox? They had some of the best pack ins!
it's like an abacus... "this counts?"
He just bitched throughout this whole video about every little thing 💀
Milking the cow in 1 2 Switch needs to be its own downloadable mini game. REALLY wish they were all piecemeal in the store...
Kinect Adventures got me grounded as a kid. Throughout the minigames it can sometimes take pictures of you. I was like 8 and the Kinect was NOT working properly. (not tracking my movements) I got mad and flipped off the TV. Only for my parents to find the picture like a month later
Man, I have to say this: I may not agree with a lot of your opinions, but I just love your videos and watch them happily all the time. You must be the only content creator I say that about.
the little ratings in between talking about the games is really nicely designed, its easier to follow the video this way!
My wife left me for a Wii Mini.
My greatest achievement is completing face raiders..twice
I am appalled you did not talk about Wii Sports resort, the greatest Wii pack in.
29:20 I can she bought it for herself.
best youtube ever
Scott almost made me want a Wii U, almost….
Why you can be mad at the Wii Mini:   “The door opens up. No GameCube. It doesn’t take up enough room. I don’t like red. It looks like a clam. The word mini is insulting to the word small. I don’t like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from video games. Too many letter I’s in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife left me for one. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn’t catch fish. Uses power. Can’t palm it like a basketball. Can’t palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn’t last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.”
face raiders is single handedly responsible for giving thousands of kids nightmares
Fine
I get it didn’t work on mass but some of my best memories was playing Nintendo Land with my family. To this day it is the only video game my mom ever actually liked
Astros playroom is on par with Mario Odyssey easily
Yeah getting a wii packed with wii sports and resorts, oh damn thank God NNN is over!
As someone who is old enough to remember when his family got an Atari 2600/VCS brand new from the store, I remember that child me was utterly crushed that the system didn't come with "Space Invaders."
I, for one, thought that the Wii Mini went very well on toast, especially after adding the marinara.
i played face raders once i never played argames because i got my 3ds second hand so i had no cards and i barely played mii plaza because i didnt have a reason to go outisde and didnt wanna pay for a million minigames.  i basically had no games on my 3ds. i think i eventually got pokemon sun but apart from that it was nothing for me. only actually started playing recently because i found out how to pirate things on it.
I would say Astro's Playroom is more of a tech demo then a game, it's just a really really good tech demo.
I’m surprised he didn’t mention “desk job”. Did Scott ever acknowledge the existence of the Deck?
Fun fact: when the Switch first came out and was very hard to find, the only way I was able to buy it was through GameStop and I had to also buy 1 2 Switch. So it was kinda like a pack in. And yeah, I played it once and never again
The "NOT FOR RESALE" Law didn't hold up well 👀
I adore Astro's so much. You mentioned the climbing part, but the coolest thing about that was the section with the breakable rocks. You can feel in the trigger where the breaking point is, and have to do a partial press to get past them. So cool. Honestly, they really need to make a full-length follow-up.
1-2 switch legit broke 2 of my controlers
Christmas 1992: Super Nintendo with Super Mario World. Christmas 1993: SEGA Fighting System with Streets of Rage 2. EPIC
common 1-2 switch hater L
man, nintendo land is super nostalgic to me, i remember playing all the minigames when i went to my cousin's house i was so amazed by what the wii u could do
I still play wii sports. Literally just 2 days ago I was with a couple of friends and we played wii bowling for like 5 hours. One friend was super hyped with every turn and the other two found it very therapeutic. Gave us all a chance to comfortably and safely drink and hang out with a fun game that keeps going. Idk about everyone else but I absolutely love wii sports.
Super Mario World demonstrated the Super Nintendo's save system.  It was almost absolutely necessary to play such a big game.
Wtf Mario Kart for Wii is a 3 on gawd wtf you on nerd😂
Nintendo Land was awesome! Period.  I played that game far more than Wii Sports when company came over.  It was a unique experience, and this is coming from someone who has played around 9,000 games, and owning over 13,000 games.  Moreover, Keith Courage is a good game! People say all kinds of things about it, but I actually really enjoyed it back when the console launched, and I still enjoy it today, along with 80+ games for the TG-16.
It's a crime we never got a new Nintendo Land for the Switch
How does Scott keep making videos? Each of these feels like a PhD of research, but yet they're dropping like flies!
17:45
I had the Mario DSi, which... didn't have any pack-ins aside from like... a Mario themed clock and calculator. Also, although I would've been a baby (if I was even born), I believe my brother's PS1 pack-in was Interactive CD Sampler Disc Vol. 9, so... yey more demos.  Same deal as the PS1, but I don't think my brother's GBC had any pack-ins either. Same with my GBA and later GBA SP.  Skip a few years, the pack-in for my OG Xbox was... a compilation disc with NCAA Football 2005 and Top Spin... Yey.  As for the Game Cube, It came with Mario Kart Double Dash and a voucher for 1 free video game. Got PSO1+.  Neither my Xbox 360, PS3, PS4, nor my brother's Xbone had pack-ins as far as I recall. And yep, neither the 3DS nor the New 3DS (of which I got that neat Mario edition) had pack-ins.
My favorite pack-in game was the lump of coal that came with the Atari VCS
SCOTT, DID YOU TAKE OUT THE PIZZA?
Love scott
That tetris gameplay physically hurt me
i guess
Astros playroom is easily the best pack-in title. It's not only a fantastic tech demo for the system, it's a total celebration of playstayion and playstation fans. Getting the ps5 at launch and playing that was an amazing experience.
It's understandable that Scott doesn't like 1,2 switch Since you need 2 people and all that
I wander how he would have rated aperture labs, hands, and aperture desk. Valve pack ins for their vr and steam deck
Im still salty that my n64 came with South Park 64 instead of Mario 64.   ....the bloody thing even needed a memory pack to save progress....
Loved it. Keep up the good work.
25:19 scott nailed the owen wilson wow
I mean Duck Hunt being the initial pack-in makes sense given the whole convincing retailers its a toy, not a game system thing.
I think it's BS to sell a console and not include a pack in game. Hell back in the day it was awesome to open up a new console and have 2 controllers and a game. I know with the internet more options are available but they look more inviting to a potential consumer to have at least a pack in game.
21:47 Scott: (paraphrased) "Everyone knows the rules of Baseball." Me back in the occident: "Sure, I don't and I know nobody that does, but sure."
I got a SNES for Christmas as a young child, maybe 8 years old or so.  Packed in with my SNES was KILLER INSTINCT on a black cartridge with a music CD of Killer Instinct music.  It was pretty bad ass looking back but not really appropriate for my age! Still had fun, and got Super Mario World soon after.
this guy just keeps gifting us with great content.
…but the Intellivision Amico comes with 6 pack in games! 5 of which we’ve known about for 4 years!
hi scott
I got a PS Vita on day one and I'm proud to say I've never even considered playing it.
I totally forgot Miis in Wii Sports don’t have arms…
What about Xbox?
Oh COME ON you show Keith Courage but don't play it? That was the only game I had for my TG16 growing up.
I'm sorry I ain't heard anyone talk about one to switch and the games he mentioned except for the Marvel game the best games one two switch at least in my friend Circle is Quick Draw that's literally even something I got my mom to play with me sword fight the untangling of treasure and yeah
I find it so funny right as Scott was about to talk about breath of the wild and then does the troll of bringing up a game most people haven't heard of it went straight to an ad and I just felt like it was my phone just saying f*** this
I don't know what exists until u unbox it
28:57 Give that to a cat 🐈  🐈‍⬛️  😃😃
that abacus line is genius
Astro's playroom = every nintendo game generation packed into a small controller demo
My brain has this weird association with Altered Beast, as when I would go over to a friend's house he had to wait till his sister watched "Lamb Chop's Play-Along!" Before we were allowed to play on his genesis  SO My brain always pulls up "this is the song that doesn't end" each time Altered Beast is mentioned.
Personally I would have to disagree with your Nintendo Land date I think the big problem with Nintendo Land it was simply not just called we Sports and it was not made to be like Wii Sports Wii Sports is Iconic and can't be replicated without it just being Wii Sports for example Wii Sports Resort and Wii sports for Nintendo switch the other reason why I disagrees that it checked all the boxes the only difference was it wasn't Wii Sports
There must be someone designing it's own game console to defunct nintendo who comes to check if scott would like it and i enjoy thinking he just misses everysingle point and has to break the console in half
19:34 What a disappointment  😄😄
YES! Finally someone talks about Has been Heroes. Love that game
14:49 Stupid duck! 😂😂
Wii sports is overrated… the input lag of this game was atrocious.
My original XBOX came with Jet Set Radio Future and a GT racing game. JSRF was an awesome pack in game
Scott’s reasons to be pissed off at the Wii mini: The door opens up. No GameCube. It doesn’t take up enough room. Not small enough. I don’t like red. It looks like a clam. The word “mini” is insulting towards the word “small.” I don’t like the Wii mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter i’s in the name.  Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn’t catch fish. Uses power. Can’t palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast.  Does not fit in shoes. Doesn’t last long in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
You know Scott's a moron and thoughts don't matter when he is kissing the ass of a game like Astros Playroom.
Damn, he's fast.
man i loved the og xbox jet set radio future pack in game
I remember getting Nintendo Land for $2 at GameStop. My review: the Metroid stuff is the best.
24:50 they probably knew people doing 3D who wanted cheaper and easier Mocap would eat it up either way
I was today years old when I learned the PS Vita had a back touchscreen
4:15 "We lost one 😢"
as a kid, nintendo land was the only game I played. Everytime my friends came over, me and my siblings would almost always play Nintendo land and the zelda adventure, Mario chase and I loved it. Thank you for refueling my nostalgia :D
I loved Nintendo Land as a kid! It was actually my introduction to most Nintendo IP
Sonic 2 with the Game Gear?
0:18 Oh look, someone gifted you a rat 🐀  😄😄😄
I can't for the life of me imagine how loud Dominic, Sam and Eric laugh in unison for Scott to have lowered the volume significantly in the bit they appear in.
6:33 not really since you still needed multiple Wii remotes to make it really worthwhile
Scott plays TF2, you can run into him on community servers. His generation has ruined TF2. It is unplayable now. Asperger's has taken over like the giant fungus mold from Akira.
14:25 I have captions on  and the words block the platform  making it look like Mario runs around the lava
“My second wide left me for a wii mini”
Kinda sad that you didn't include the sega master system.  Originally packed in with hang on preloaded then Alex Kidd for the revision model   In the UK, anyone over the age of 30 know Alex Kidd better than Mario. No joke
Oh man he's even mentioning Atari 2600 and sort of acknowledging that turbo graphics ... existed. *Waits for the other Atari consoles* .... ......... What the ... ?That was a random grab bag of randomness. And where was the virtual boy?
you left our probably the most important/successful pack in of all time- Halo CE
My first wife left me for a Wii Mini too.
Honestly, this video should've been packed in with the channel.
Nintendoland was amazing. My friends and I loved that shit
Uncharted golden abyss was the best vita game that showed off the devices capabilities.
SCOTT just saying hey, take care of yourself, don't burn yourself out on our account,  I don't know if that's the case or if you're just tired, you can definitely see a physical change in you, you look worn out, So please in order to keep the great content flowing don't burn yourself out I want this channel to last a long long time
I would say mariokart 7 is basically THE pack in title for the 3ds family of systems, as so many of them come with it preinstalled.
The Indiana Jones kungfu panda was the Xbox 360 I had
Bro j copying the angry video game nerd lmao
I always get the feeling that 1-2 switch was meant to be the switch's pack-in game, but they changed it at the last minute to keep the price low
💗💖 Sorry I’m Late❣️ 💖💗
Jesus Scott, I hope you have an editor cause your ability to pump out quality content this fast is scary.
Has-Been Heroes fan just poking his head in.
I really sure glad I have yet to get ps5 because of scalpers and hard to come by hardware at this time yet youtubers act like yeah we have them because we have money to spend on the high priced ones, "what you cant afford one yourself? What are you stupid and broke little bitch?" Acting like we can just walk into any target and pick one up atm like we used to.
Nintendo Land was a fucking banger and I will not hear otherwise
26:32  The doors open up No GameCube It doesn’t take up enough room Not small enough  I don’t like red It looks like a clam The word “mini” is insulting to the word small I don’t like the wii mini I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working I lost it under my couch I lost it over my couch  I like red so much it distracts me from the video games Too many letters in the name Too much value My wife left me for one My second wife just left me If it had eyes, it would have stink eyes Doesn’t catch fish Uses power Can’t palm it like a basketball Can’t palm it like a football Does NOT go well on toast Does not fit in shoes Doesn’t last long enough in the microwave  Has never tipped well at restaurants  Treats service workers poorly  Treats itself even worse
#10 trending for gaming
The fact that Scott held a wet rat by the tail for this video... This channel is incredible
first system i had was NES with the Mario/Duck Hunt cartridge, and no zapper. SNES came out some years later, and while i could play it at the day care centers with Super Mario World, i was fine without it. until i saw it packed with the first Donkey Kong Country. so of course i got that for Christmas and played it in the coming months/years, getting each sequel after they came out. my N64 was used, so no freebie games there. think i only had about 4 or 5 titles at the time. then came the Gamecube with the Zelda Collector's Edition included. that was pretty much the last system my parents got me until my dad ordered a PS3 off ebay
Astros playroom was a love letter to playstation fans. I loved every single second of it and it was my favorite ps5 game for quite a while when I first got mine
I’m so glad to hear Scott talk about Astro’s Playroom, I adore that game
I definitely had some space ship game on the NES that used the zapper. No idea what it was called.
$40 for free.
Hi
2:10 has to be one of the best jokes Scott has made. We need a compilation of the best jokes in one video.
The only contact i ever had with nintendoland was playing it almost every new years eve for 7 years as a party game cause my fiancé’s brother owns it.   Did i enjoy going crosseyed cause of the animal crossing minigame? Of couse. But it wouldn’t have made me buy a wii u.
I remember back in ‘03 getting my first GameCube for Christmas and getting the Zelda Collector’s Edition tie-in disc, only to realize it didn’t include a memory card. So I couldn’t save my games… 🙃 wasn’t very familiar with memory cards at that age 😅
Ignorant about turbograft 16, what a joke of video
Astro's Playroom is incredible it's still super fun to replay and 100%
I think I got my PS2 slim came with eye toy play sports. Sega came with Alex the kidd. Wii came with Wii sports, Mario kart Wii and the first donkey Kong. NDS and GBA came without any games
Tearaway would have been the best game to pack in with the Vita
Surprised to not see Alex the kid is not on the list
23:40 The skin around your thumb looks real painful, you okay?
23:41 hangnail, ouch
(13:45) Do note that this applies to the North American market. The other pack in games were global. But the whole ROB thing was for the North American market specifically.
21:41 Scott beating the sht out of Maximilian Dood
"Big, stinky crotch." -Scott Wozniak
Sonic is a game you finish in a single afternoon, Super Mario World has you hooked for days.
22:55 Oh, sure. Don't mind poor old Klonoa over there T_T
I never played nintendo land I think, the premium price was for the extra disk space, 32 gb was very little, but 8 gb would have been atrocious.
1-2 Switch was such a blast for literally 24 hours with my roommates until I realized I should have used that 60 dollars to buy Breath of the Wild instead lol
I've still got most of my Pack-in games for my consoles, Happy Holidays Scott!
I expected the Wii Mini to last AT LEAST 2 mins in the microwave, the results were disappointing...
"I put marinara sauce on it and it stopped working" 🤣🤣🤣
Nintendo Land is an amazing game and my family's number one Nintendo multiplayer game experience. Especially the Animal Crossing, Mario Chase, and Luigi's Mansion games
I can't believe that scott forgot about the breakout clone that is in the 3ds browser!!!!!!!!!!!1!!!
My crotch hurts too, man.
Astro's Playroom was so good; I'd love to see Sony put out a full out Astro's Playroom game sometime. I feel like the Astro games I've seen have always just been tech demos for new hardware.
Today I learned there was a Wii mini.
I bought nintendo land 2 years ago for 2 dollars and I would have paid 50 for it ( I was 12 and had 3 siblings)
well today i learned there was a wii mini
That Metroid game was a DEMO?!! I remember banging my head against that game cause it was so hard and I was so happy when i finally completed it. I was only like 6-7 though.
My mom got me and my older brother the Power Set NES with the power pad. Along with Rad Racer, and Mike Tyson’s Punch*Out. We played them all everyday. My mom hated the stomping on the floor so we sat down and used our fists. The NES power set was the best for me!
Hurts me that he didn't include PSVR. The Demo Disc 1&2 Plus a disussion about PSVR Worlds would have been a perfect fit for this video. Especially as Scott doesn't usually talk about VR, there would not have been as much overlap here
That's very good! Like.
Idc how many online services and bundles come with consoles these days. Without an exlusive pack in the deal will always seem lacking.. I bought 3 games when I bought the ps5 but I spent a long time on Astros playroom before I played anything else
Scott: A Nintendo Switch game that should’ve been a pack in....  Me: SnipperClips!
Hey, screw you, hippie, Keith Courage was great!
So all of the first gen gaming consoles have back-in games and the only games you can play 😅
1 2 Switch is the greatest casual party game to play with friends while drinking that has ever been made. Change my mind.
This man is capable of shitting out interesting content out his ass It’s amazing
The Luigis mansion mini game in Nintendoland scared the shit out of me as a kid
his smile in the thumbnail looks makes it look like hes barely holding it together and he is going to snap
Joke's on you Scott, my Nintendo switch came with has been heroes.  Thank you overpriced GameStop bundle from 2017. ❤️
Let's be honest. Wii sports is the 🐐.
I don't get the rating system😶
I was literally just thinking "I want some Scott" and now he uploads. Thank God
fan fact the playstation move controllers work with ps vr and is the only ps3 related thing that works on ps4 and 5
This isn’t that 3 hour Wii U retrospective
LETS GOOOO NEW STW VIDEOOOOO
Why do you call dollars bones?
@ScottTheWoz 7:16 ... 22:16 take out the pizza
I mean, 1 2 Switch also showcases the local multiplayer that's possible with just the JoyCons. So three things the Switch can do.
And this channel came Pack-In with "The Internet and You"
Many Nintendo fans want Nintendo Land to get ported to Switch to give it a second change. They think it's a waste to let it die with the WII U. But honestly, I cannot see how that would work.
Big beach sports and carnival games....... I loved them as a kid I
Thank you Scott for a new video!
Half Life Alyx was basically a pack in, I know PC games aren't really your thing but I woulda been interested to see what you thought of it as a system seller
I'm not seeing many comments defending it, but I've had some of the best memories playing a video game with my family playing 1-2 Switch. Sure not all games are perfect, but seeing my grandma mess up during the Flags game almost made me piss myself laugh
4:54Who is guy in the bottem right?
07:16 He forgot about his pizza! D:
I had the feeling every ds came with a r4 card 😂
This is the first time I’ve even heard of Nintendo land
I played hours of face raiders
No pack-in title will be more impactful than TETRIS
scot tthe woz
i like kung fu panda
It'd be kinda neat Sony took Sports Champions' Gladiator mini-game and just expanded it into it's own game for, like, PS VR.
this sure is the scott the woz
Ya know what did surprise me?  The Steam Deck - Valve's new(ish) game device/laptop hybrid thing has its own pack in: Aperture Desk Job. A fun lil romp with a murderous robot using a toilet with guns to showcase its controller.
Now he's getting really deep into the topic of "Pack-In Syndrome".
The return of the *Pack in syndrome™*
Looks like Scott forgot the pack-in for the original Xbox, just like everyone else 🤨 Sega GT / Jet Set Radio Future Combo Disk also had advertisements on it for Blinx, Buffy the Vampire, Panzer Dragoon, a snowboarding game, and also an advertisement for Xbox Live.
I love pack in games! :D
What is the song at the start
Retro
For some reason I loved the pikmen mini game in Nintendo land
How about a video where you talk about the first game you got with all the consoles you own?
Being on mobile I could only catch half of that at 26:32, lol
I remembering spending hours everyday trying to beat the donkey Kong crash course game with my friend. We never did. And then he sold the game.
I bought a Wii U, are you calling me a fool? Wait, nevermind, that checks out.
I was fully expecting him to not mention "combat" but no, the summer child throws it in, good job kid, good job
Astrobot Playroom is the best pack-in game ever made
10:21 If you want a full version of the game there was a vr game on the ps4 called Astro bot rescue mission which is basically a full version of this game
Oh shoot, hearing SKU gave me retail flashbacks
7:33 Scot what happened to your thumb?
Little Deviants looks fine enough, but Tearaway would have been an awesome choice for a pack-in - a fun, charming little game that utilizes all the Vita’s features. I played through it a year or two ago and really fell in love with it.
I used to play Kinect all the time. My mom would take away my 360 controller so I would use it to turn on the system and then the only game I could play would be Kinect adventures. So many bad memories 😊😊
Yay Scott. Today will be a good day.
21:58 Did Scott just say Wii Sports has no singleplayer? Literally all of the sports can be played on your own against CPUs lol
Alex Kidd in Miracle World which was packed into the Master System's actual hardware is quietly crying in a corner.
The only good thing to come from the existence of Altered Beast is Murder of the Universe. All the cool people out there know what I mean.
technically every free game on steam is a pack in for the steam deck, so you forgot those
Astro's playroom with the ps5, tearaway away with the ps vita, wii sport and resort with the wii are in my opinion the best kind of pack in games; games that showcase the unique experiences only possible on the given consoles technology, or simply that the games would be worse on any other device.
Scott always comes out with a video at the right time 😂
Brb, modding the n64 to have that splash that says go back to target
Meow
I remember the joy of playing my bundle game on the DS: Metroid...       PINBALL
bro black things on black background aren't the clearest score indicator
Best pack of all times was the Batman pack for the Commodore Amiga 500!
So, pack-in for ps5 would be demon souls? 🤔
new super Mario bros 2 came with with the 2ds.
You my friend are the king of satire. 🏅
you gotta give scott this : he does a very good impression of a baby
I didn’t even get Nintendo Land. My Wii U came with ZombiU.
That's how zero dawn sold 20 million units
Scott’s work ethic is very impressive Scott you can take a break
Did I miss the Master System with the Snail Maze pack in - that was truly ripping the piss.
it took me a while to finally understand the ranking system
when I bought my N64, I couldn't afford a game at the same time.  I ended up buying the console and then renting games for the next few months.
when scott said that he was 14 when the 3ds was new I was like haha what? but yes... it's already been 11 years what the hell
I just bought a mp4 player and this video came with it.
Your Atari 2600 picks don't work because those came along years later. From 77 your best bet would've been Chase. Which is best known as being the light cycle game played in Tron. It was not only 1 and 2 player but it had a ton of modes and a doodle mode. It would've showed off the console great!   I think it came a little later in the year though. The naive choice was Video Olympics, which was a bunch of good variants of Pong including 1 player modes. But everyone had already seen that by then. Combat was unfortunately all they had.   Fun fact: they were thinking of having Pong or what start up if they're was no cartridge in but they wanted to have a pack in cartridge to emphasize cartridge = game. If they didn't need a cartridge because a game showed up when they turned it on they might not ever think to buy any more.
LMAOOOOOO the part where hes making noises with the wii had me crying tears
I'm getting the Mario Kart 8 bundled Switch for Christmas. I feel like a kid getting my N64 for Christmas again lol
Felt called out at 17:18 since my DSI XL is literally in my sock drawer right now
Hey Scott all here! In my opinion, the best pack in game was Nintendo Land, a lot of people would definitely go with Wii sports over it, but I just love Nintendo land much more it’s too fun, especially the Zelda mini game
I remember getting altered beast on 360 cause the achievements were easy. Wow, back when that mattered
I love the Wii U, but I really can't defend Nintendoland.  Got the Zelda Windwaker Bundle and in my view, it made good use of the Gamepad - something BotW missed, although it was  a much better game (but the UI was a step back).  Project Zero, for example, is a game where I felt that the gamepad was essential. But to really "show off", there are titles like Mario Kart and Smash Bros. The latter supported 8 players simultaneously on the same console, something no other modern console can offer.
Anyone else think it’s weird to talk about Mario world not being a graphically impressive pack in but then ignoring that donkey Kong country was a late system pack?
When Scott said "Wow! I need a Wii U!" at 5:43 I was actually susprised not to see him drowning in a sea of Wii Us
Hi Scott 👋😊
I loved altered beast back In the day.lklolol power up
Combat? Combat. Combat? Combat!
4:50 I guess Scott  gave up trying to make it seem like HE was playing the games...
My pack in for the Super Nintendo was Killer Instinct. As a young child who never played a video game before, I was mostly confused. It was cool but not really appealing to me. I hardly really played Super Mario World like other kids. Never even owned it. It would have nearly meant I would have never gotten into video games. The game that saved it? ...Maui Mallard in Cold Shadow *then* the real eye opener: Yoshi's Island.
17:07 literally my sociability in my whole life
1 2 Switch is the better "Spare Box" if one of your Gameboxes are damaged
My 3DS came with two games (Epic Mickey and Professor Layton and the MIracle Mask), though it was a 3DS xl in Europe
For me, Nintendoland is one of the best multiplayer game of all time. So unique. Also the best pack-in I have ever had!
0:52 wow don't disrespect my console bundle
Aperture Desk Job deserves an honourable mention here. It's a tech demo for the Steam Deck, and it's incredibly charming and well-written. Sure, the whole thing is over in less than half an hour, but in that time you learned all there is to know.       It's great.
Stop biting your nails. Loved the video though.
Kind of a stretch, but it’s too bad Portal Desk Job didn’t make it into the video
This is the third video I've seen about Nintendo Land in a span of a month. The funny thing is that I didn't even know it exist prior.
Can you stop shooting ducks plesae
Love the deep and detailed review of Keith Courage
While Nintendo Land did a fine job showing off what the Wii U gamepad could contribute to local multiplayer games (imo, the Luigi's Mansion minigame was especially good), i think that Game & Wario had much more clever uses of the new hardware in single players experiences (the pirate one, the taxi one, the one which uses the controller as a camera, the bow and arrows one, which is basically a richer version of the murasame minigame). Both games were ultimately too filler-y, but if they combined the two of them I think it would have resulted in a much better pack-in game. I still think that the Wii U Gamepad wasn't really that useful, that it really was just an unnecessary gimmick, but they definitely could have made a much better job displaying its potential.
How dare you slander face raiders. Face raiders for GOTY 2022!😡 I have more hours in that game than I have chromosomes!
My guy, you gotta play Astrobot on PSVR. It's a full length playroom game. I bought it for my kid, and ended up platinuming it. I haven't felt that much child-like joy since Mario64
350 instead of 300? i got it for 6 dollars ;-;
Man, he's REALLLY upset about missing Halloween isn't he, awesome stuff Scott
22:48 I see  no difference between the mii and IRL scott.
But Scott what about links crossbow training
I got 1-2 switch as a pack in over here in Europe   I regret not getting breath of the wild earlier
Not even a minute in and I'm giggling at Scott playing with the wii like it's an airplane
I like what Scott is doing with his upload schedule, if you want the more constant releases, watch Scott's stash. But because of Scott's stash, he can take his time with the normal releases ensuring they are of the highest quality.
No N64?
The Kinect and PS Move are probably the two most embarrassing products that either company released. I am so glad I never bought either of them.
26:33 the marinara one caught me off guard
2 MENTIONS OF HAS BEEN HEROES IN ONE VIDEO WHAT IS THIS TIMELINE?!
It's a shame Scott never got into streetpass plaza because it is definitely a Wii Sports level pack in. The games weren't too deep or anything, but it excelled at showcasing the social aspects of a handheld system. The green light flashing when walking past someone on the street was such a uniquely great experience. Someone you have never met before, didn't talk to, and probably never will just walks by you and you immediately have a bit respect for them because you both decided to bring your 3ds with you and kept it on in your pocket just so you can get each other's streetpass is just so great. Or playing your 3ds in a car ride and seeing the green light flicker after a car goes by. You never even saw the person playing. You just know there was someone in that car that was just like you. The unique sense of community it brought is unlike anything else. Then looking back through your plaza and seeing all the miis of the people you have passed and going to the games and looking through the puzzles you were able to fill out or the bosses you were able to beat from all the help of every you met was just magical.  And I just realized this is pretty much the exact same rant Schlatt went on in the chuckle sandwich podcast with Scott, but I think the fact that our experiences with it were pretty much the same just reinforces my point.
New Scott yeassss❤
the asymmetrical games in the wii u were its greatest strength. Too bad it's only enjoyable as a Lan part event.
Hold up.  What was that Turbo Graphics 16 pack in title?  I need to know more about it.  😂😂
Astro did have a standalone platformer that was more feature rich. Problem is that it was a VR exclusive, but man was it a brilliant one.
lets GO dude
Super Mario World blew Sonic away..
26:32 “It doesn’t take up enough room.” “Not small enough.” “I don’t like the Wii Mini.”
Hey, shouldn't Welcome Park technically be considered as the Vita's pack-in game as well? Regardless, great video!
My First Pack in console was PS3 with TLOU & GT6. Best Console gift ever!
Secretly Scott owns every game publisher and developers just to make bad moves so that he can make fun of them. That’s why it feels like he’s always conjuring an obscure console or game from the 80’s that sounds vaguely familiar.
Oh no did he just undermine online flash games?
Did Scott die and someone released his backlog? He uploaded three times in like the last week.
Back in the day, you got a pack in game and 2 controllers. Video game companies got truly greedy in more recent years.
Man, I had a lot of fun with Kinect Adventures
Nice video! On the subject of the 3DS, I never got anything out of Mii Plaza UNTIL I went to work at a video game company, where a ton of other people had 3DSes, so you'd just ping each other during breaks and then play it on the train on the way home, I was like "Oh wow, so THIS is what it's meant to be like."
We finally have proof that Scott bites his nails
"Actually this may have some Nintendo Land syndrome." *"Oh, God!"* I lost it there lol
I can't believe Scott didn't talk about the greatest pack in of all time: Mario Tennis for Virtual Boy.  He has now officially lost his Nintendo Adult License, and with it, his virginity. I have no choice but to unsub.
for those that are curious, at here's the full list at 26:32:  The door opens up. No GameCube. It doesn't take up enough room. Not small enough. I don't like red. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from video games. Too many letter i's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me, If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
What about aperture desk job. That's basically a pack in in spirit.
I can’t believe I got spoiled about consoles that came out ONLY YEARS AGO
This is nice having this is nice
Holy shit it's Scott the Woz
astros playroom is a great game to play while waiting for a download
My Gameboy in 1995 came with Donkey Kong. My parents said "yeah that'll get you by". My n64 in 1997 didn't have a pack in so, the bought me Hexen. Guess which system I played more.
I was lucky enough back in the day to get the SNES Super Set with Mario World and All-Stars
I find the thought of Keith Courage being the only TurboGrafx-16 game he owns fucking hilarious
Mii Plaza came at just the right time in my life where I had a train + walking commute to work. Accumulated some hundred or so Miis, and my 3DS still works. Nice bit of memories of random folks on a train, regular passersby, and coworkers.
this is a very big topic, which is worth only ps3 with its bundles
Hi Scott :) Hi
Scot could complain about water.
I thought the pack in game for the 3DS was Zelda a Link Between Worlds. What do you mean you have to download it separately?
scott : « everybody knows these sports, no need for a refresher on the rules » europeans who have no idea what a baseball is : « yes »
I know this is outside of Scott's dedication to old games, but the Evercade always had a decent line-up of pack in titles. Whether it be the original model with its launch line-up, the console made Vs. model with its first line-up of console collections, or the new EXP model with the built-in Capcom games and more recent arcade collection cartridges. While the system itself always needed room for improvement, they've always strived to preserve as much classics as legally possible on physical format for a much more reasonable price than buying the original game versions outright.
That pumpkin can't play football, but it can save game data.
I can’t wait for the day Scott does a fighting game video
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
Seeing this video came out while at work on a Friday now frothing at the mouth of the thought to watch this tonight with a beer😍
I miss the days when you could buy a console at a store.
Sm64ds
Comment
I love how Scott tries so hard to not mention anything video related. Like instead of saying "All the games I explained throughout this video" he says "All the examples given." Probably why he doesn't feel like a YouTuber and more-so some normal guy talking behind a camera some information on stupid Nintendo games...
I don't know why but seeing Scott happily talking while being blinded by a blind fold with his glasses on top of it makes me laugh and smile a lot.
Today I learned that the Vita has a touch pad on the back
Did Scott have to make a whole ass patient whiteboard? No. He didn’t. But he did that. He did that for US. 😭♥️
my first switch game was has been heroes lol
Some one missed ASTRO bot for PSVR
22:56 Super Paper Mario <3
I hoped to see Half-Life Alyx, the amazing pack-in with the Valve Index.
It always feels weird to me when Scott talks about Wii Sports like some universal experience when I've never played it. My definitive Wii game was Brawl...
I got my vita close to ten years ago with  Borderlands 2 packed in with it. One of my favorite experiences as a kid to this day :)
Rating points being black on white cut-outs are super confusing and not easy to look on.
the episode is lying! the wii mini does catch fish if you try hard enough!
Hello from Turkey, Scott🇹🇷
Starlight zone!!!
New video great day also astros playroom is so fun i would love a whole game from astro like this
Combat as a single player game?  Do you want your 2600 to catch on fire?   It's a minor miracle the 2600 was able to display anything beyond monochrome graphics.
Virtua Fighter for Saturn is probably one of the funniest. Oops we rushed it out so here's a remix version to make ya feel better
No mention of the Master System's pack in Alex the Kidd.  Tsk tsk. (Busts out the Master System) See me after class, Scott.
Woulda been funny if he brought up that the Turbo Grafx 16 game was also a butchered licensed game for a property nobody outside of Japan had ever heard of.
My family and I had a great time with the 3 asymmetrical multiplayer games in Nintendo Land, and for me, those 3 games justified owning a WiiU.
I am still seriously surprised to this day that 1,2 Switch wasn't a pack in for the Switch
I feel like when Scott reaches another milestone, he should do a video about video game credits.
Scott the woz when his TV goes "bah bah!" And trips:
Reasons to be pissed off at the Wii mini, according to this video:  The door opens up. No gamecube. It doesn't take up enough room. Not small enough. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter i's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
as much as gyromite wasn't the best pack in title, it and duck hunt were absolutely necessary for the time considering the reputation of video games in north america as an outdated fad. I guarantee that if the nes had initially been sold without rob the industry would look a lot different today.
The PS Vita packin in Australia was Wipeout, at least for the 3G model
I’ll take PS5’s amazing game. Retro, I felt SMAS was the best pack in games ever.
I'm gonna be honest i played a ton of face raiders when the 3ds came out. To be fair to me, the 3ds had no games for like the first year
Has-Been Heroes was my first Switch game I bought on ebay. The guy gave me 2 screen protectors for free, and I was glad for them
If the Wii mini treats itself worse than service workers why try to drown it in marinara sauce if it doesn't catch fish. You have to golf it into the oven.
My ad break made Scott say “Du-khunt”
The kinect was fantastic! - I used to love using it to play the sports games and also it was super useful to control the console when your controller batteries died or you couldn't find the controller and it worked great to move the cursor around the screen and click on stuff. - fantastic in particular for netflix.  my family would take turns choosing kids shows to watch.
Are narrator Scott and normal Scott different people?
11:59 Does anyone here know who the girl on the right is?
Went to sleep only to wake up at 2:00 to see a new Scott the woz video on my favourite subject in school Guess I’m staying up now sorry mom
Gey scott
Does NOT go well on toast.
Hey all, Scott here!
I’m concerned, I think he bought a new wii u for Nintendo land
how is 1 2 Switch not replayable?? me and my friends have played it a bunch whenever we're hanging out for a long while
Street pass was crazy in public 😭
0:27 was 9 year old me Xmas 1998...excited when i got my n64 but nothing to play I had to wait till my bday in January before I got my first game...the torture😆
Domo arigato Mr Scotto
Should we consider Aperture Desk Job the pack-in for the Steam Deck? I think we should
17:13 “I don’t like Nintendo, I like having a big, stinky crotch” quote of the year
Since I sleep with YouTube on I wake up to scottthewoz sometimes
I think the main problem with Nintendo Land is that there isn't really an exact purpose for the Wii U Gamepad. Wiis whole gimick is that there are motion controls, but other then a "different perspective", the gamepad doesn't really bring special to the table, at least as special as motion controls. Its hard to showcase the consoles purpose when its more of just an upgrade from the original.
Gyromite 🤣🤣
Hi 👋 you all
When I bought my 3DS I spent my money for a game for a case instead. I spent about a month grinding Mii maker, Mii plaza , are games and face raiders. Beating the activity log is one of my biggest gaming moments.
pack it out pack it in, let me begin
The mice guys the great mice detective 😭😭😭😭
thank you for existing
That WiiU stand is still being used by me on the daily
Hey scott, all here, not every video has to be 30 mins long, don't push yourself too hard.
Scott and other YouTubers should bring their 3ds to conventions so fans can street pass, thad be cool
I hope I'm never compared to NintendoLand
Tomato
Thank you for talking about NintendoLand, even though it didn't top Wii sports I made some awesome memories with it and have never seen it talked about lol
Can we just take time to notice how the kinnect did better in sales than the wiiu. Thats something else.
By the time the Wii Mini launched, every game store on the planet already had dozens of worthless Wii wheels sitting on every flat surface covered in 99-cent price stickers, so Nintendo was smart to not divert any more plastic from potentially doing something useful by making even MORE of them.
I'll never stop being confused about Altered Beast being included with every Genesis/MD compilation EVER. Like unless it was explicitly a Sonic collection, Altered Beast is gonna be in there. And it SUCKS.
I can see how in a single person household Combat would be a useless pack-in, but my dad, my brother and I played the hell out of that game.   Tetris was my favourite pack-in though.  Beating Tetris was the crowning achievement of my life.  It's all been downhill since then.
Nintendo Land. Literally brought memories back. It’s been YEARS. Since we’ve played. The amount of nostalgia let screams out of my mouth. Our favorite was the Luigi’s mansion one and the animal crossing elephant one. Best game ever. Really fun thank you for reminding me
i love these videos, they are always so fun and relaxing
Astro's Playroom actually utilized all the base mechanics from Astro Bot Rescue Mission, a psvr game that was based on a minigame in the playroom vr which was a free downloadable game for the same accessory  if you played Astro's Playroom and were wishing for more please play Astro Bot Rescue Mission cause it is the best vr game I've ever played
What you have to remember about the Atari having a multiplayer game as q pack in is at the time most homes only had one TV.  Most of the time there was more than one person in front of it.
I remember those gyroscopic controllers and really didn't think they could do anything but gimmicks UNTIL some first-person shooters started incorporating gyro aim. It's an exceptionally good use of the tool that lets controller players aim with precision previously only available to mouse and keyboard players (or otherwise various forms of auto-aim)
how did you just skip the turbo grafx 😂
This is actually the first time I've ever even heard of Nintendo land...
"I wish Astro's Playroom could have been a full platformer!" Astro Bot: Rescue Mission is RIGHT THERE.
I’d argue that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has become a sort of pack-in game for the Switch. Nintendo has yet to discount the price of the Switch for any reason. Instead, around the holiday season, they throw in a free copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
wait there was a wii mini
I like red so much it distracts me from video games 🤣🤣🤣
Really no Welcome Park WTF! It's built into the Vita Scott come on! Cybermorph on Jaguar? Playroom/Playroom VR/PSVR Worlds. Lights out for Gamecom. HyperScan? Part 2? sigh. Gizmondo Trailblazer and NGage/Gizmondo demo cards. What a mess. Also the Turbo Graphx one did you have to skip it (even with a bit of footage I'd have been happy this is the Oneechanbara video levels of lazy you couldn't be bothered seriously I get it the footage, ideas and being busy but come on. You just have to the appealing games for mainstream appeal forget the more interesting niche consoles come on).  There is Fling Smash, Mr Bones, Dino Ricky and other mentions but you can't even show a Turbo Graphx game like WTF just show footage of it you do with other games you don't own.  Ah Welcome Park on Vita (come on Scott it was built in like Astro and Playroom/Playroom VR sigh what did you think it was a settings app? I use the back touchpad a fair amount in many games core and casual not even counting Japanese niche games) one I always go back to sometimes, the Gamecom had Lights out bundled into the system, Xbox One Kinetic Gesture app? Besides 360 Kinetic adventures. Gyromite for Rob, Face Raiders is fine for the 3DS I think Welcome Park was more interesting though. Barely used Street Pass, Puzzle and Dungeons ones are all I have don't use my handhelds outside much and in 2020-2022 who was using the 3DS that much very small groups of people. Never used AR games as have no AR cards. Maybe Kid Icarus ones didn't have the game but still apparently I have them. I got mine used so. I forget First Hunt demo is a pack in.  The Turbo Graphx had a pack in? Also really Scott come on cover it you'll say Fling Smash, Mr Bones and others but when it comes down to it you don't cover certain games that count only the iconic ones. Sigh.  Mario's Tennis for Virtual Boy. Gizmondo (Trailblazer maybe?) or NGage demo cards. PSVR Worlds with the demo disk.  Duck Hunt for the Zapper sure, no clue Combat was a pack in, Altered Beast for Genesis/MG.  I agryqhile Mario World can be fun the speed/3D of F Zero, 3D and scaling of Pilot Wings (which is a tech demo title on SNES/64/3DS), and the others for sure but for a safe game even besides it's general gameplay yeah it's very safe besides Sonic being a fast platformer to showcase it's CPU blast processing jokes and all.  I forgot about Sports Champions I bought it used as never had it, same with Nintendo Land I had to get it later XD glad I did but still Pack Ins later kind of changes things. I agree that sure why convince average people with Nintendo IPs in Nintendo Land when bowling or something else is more understandable which to me which I think is just ridiculous but not surprised. The Gamepad validation I mean sure but you didn't need to dual screens in the DS/3DS but then again the DS was a pre-smartphone for personal trainer cooking, 100 classic books and brain age so sure. Sure get Scrabble, Who wants to be a millionaire or Big Strike Bowling for the PS1, Wheel of Fortune for the Wii (yes my experiences). Casuals are laughable. (to me Ratchet and Clank Tools of Destruction was always my Sixaxis testing game for the weapons, ball puzzles and glider that used it, otherwise it would be Killzone 2&3, Resistance 3 and Killzone 3 with Move worked alright but syncing Move between PS3/4 sucks sometimes and the battery gets awkward or the syncing with the cable it's weirdly annoying), same with Xbox One Kinetic Rivals I got it cheap not with my Xbox One VCR with the Kinetic back in the day (never had a 360 Kinetic either), Playroom and Playroom VR for PS4 and PSVR, Astrobot on PS5. Tutorials and trophies.  Sad the Gesture Tutorial app is gone with the 2013 Xbox One dashboard sigh. Well at least many launch games use the Xbox One Kinetic, I didn't besides Zoo Tycoon I think and it's a dumbed down game so I put it on the shelf like it belongs.  But many of those are on the digital side besides the bundles with games like Mario Kart or Mario Bros/Duck Hunt on Nintendo ones, forgot the Little Deviants one, I guess Ring Fit and Wii Fit count with their peripherals.  Link's Crossbow Training for the Zapper plastic holder or Wii Sports/Nintendo Land, 1-2 Switch side of things.
Nintendo land is great, one of the best party games
Before the days of free to play games
It's a shame asymetrical multiplayer peaked on the Wii U with Nintendoland. My friends and I had a lot of fun with the Luigi's Mansion and Mario Chase games, but they're weren't really any other games that did something similar afterward.
I’m really surprised you didn’t mention the pack in Zelda collection they started bundling with GameCubes after they went for the 99$ price drop , it was such a good value and even included a wind waker demo
Still can’t get over that outro music.
Scott once again making me deeply interested in a subject I didn't give a shit about until right now.
My Wii Mini treated service workers exceptionally well. Be a better role model for your system.
Got Mario Kart DS as a pack-in title for my red DS, and will now have to look for Astro's Playroom on my PS5. That said, I guess the red DS with Mario Kart was more of a bundle since the game came out sometime after the system came out. Still, it was red and the game was pretty good too.
19:06 first thing I thought of was the king gizz song before the game itself lmao
Fun fact: The Vita had TWO pack-in games: The aforementioned Little Deviants, and the pre-installed on all Vitas Welcome Park. Welcome Park is the bare minimum required to be even considered a game, featuring a few one-dimensional modes designed to showcase the hardware features while hardly hampering the graphics whatsoever. It made Little Deviants look actually good as a tie-in.
Wii sports is the golden bridge of Pack in games. But I have to admit, Astro’s Playground was really downplayed in this video. From a “new guy” perspective it’s understandable “average”, but if you’re a long time fan of PS, then it’s one of the best experiences I’ve had in gaming! It’s basically one of the few PS5 games that feels like a PS5 game instead of a PS4 upgraded port.  It used the PS5 controller in a way that has me looking forward to the future and how devs will go beyond only using heavy triggers on rocket launchers.  The references were too good for fans both old and new! You had modern classics like God of War 2018 and Bloodborne, and stuff for old fans like the PS1 Trex and Sly cooper.   Sure it was short, but looking at trophies (like always) most people aren’t able to experience the full game, so I guess that’s more of a “us nerd” problem.
Scott made a video at night that’s impossible
Didn't Mario Kart 7 become a pack-in for the 2DS?
SMH Scott didn't mention Snail Maze
Nintendo Land was a blast when you brought it up I had a bunch of memories, me and my friends would play it for hours and hours on end, and it wasn't just when the Wii U came up till the switch release we just spent time playing it when we had a bunch of friends over and couldn't decide on a game
1 2 switch is the type of game you'd buy from the used game pile in 2013 for $6.37 because you needed a few extra dollars to qualify for some sort of promo.
happy fire emblem three hopes launch day
put some respek on wii sportz
The 3DS has pre installed Mario Kart 7, New Super Mario Bros 2, Super Mario Maker for 3DS  , Pokemon X & Y. Metroid: Samus Returns. The New Nintendo 3DS has pre installed Pokémon Red & Blue, Super Mario World & Super Mario Kart.
Scott The Woz was implicated in a manslaughter case in 1997
POP IN THE GAY-
tfw Scott fucked his Nintendo 64
I used to love play faceraiders with my cousins it was weird but very fun when we didn't have games
holy shit scott, how'd you know i had an eye exam today in which they used those blurry vision eyedrops and needed a new video i can relate to:?
Streetpass Mii Plaza was pretty awesome if you could get a few Streetpasses a day and would spend 10-15 minutes going through them everyday as sort of a mobile-type experience. Slowly chipping away at those puzzles was fun and I even bought the bonus games. My garden was pretty great and I think I was in the very endgame of that feudalism one. Great memories.
Damn, daddy Woz with another one?! Yeee
I believe the wii sports was the "everyone can play! even your grandma" given how they were just simple sports games. While the wii u  nintendoland was more for the average house hold person (people who play games)
Who TF Is ryan
Ohhh u talked about street pass cause of that one dude from the sandwich podcast
You’ve gotta be running out of ideas there’s no way you have more
You definitely shouldn’t be talking about altered beast
Scott doesn’t sleep!
At this point the L button is a possibility
Funny story, last year Sony used to held a contest where you place your bid, and see if you had the highest bid or not. Whoever won would get a PS5, and two games with it as free bonus… I initially won a context with the PS5 and a copy of Demon Souls and Sackboy A Big Adventuee being the prize, however it turned out what I thought was free, were actually expensive to get. And so, I cancelled out. I eventually got a PS5 3 months later, but it must’ve been really exaggerating to have almost gotten 2 games for free.
Yo. Master System had a built in game that played when no game was inserted. Was very upset this was missing.
You forgot UNO for the Xbox 360.
holy shit it's another scott the woz video on a subject i could've gone my whole life without knowing i cared about it.
What’s the problem with the Wii min-  “there’s no online” THERES NO ONLINE????
Hot take alert: I have far more fond memories of Nintendoland than I do with the original wii sports. My siblings and I played a lot of Nintendo land, usually Mario chase, Luigi’s mansion, or the Zelda mini game, and the Metroid multiplayer, and would genuinely want to play it over other full games. The multiplayer in wii sports was always somewhat limited, for example you rarely could have more than one player play at a time, usually taking turns, which meant a lot of down time. Nintendoland let us all play and because a lot of the multiplayer games had a totally different role for the person using the game pad we would almost have to play at least three rounds of a game so all of us could experience the different roles. Now wii sports resort is a different beast and I don’t know if I could pick between it and Nintendoland, but if we’re talking strictly pack-ins, Nintendoland wins by a landslide for me.
Reasons to be pissed off at the wii mini The door opens up Mo GameCube It doesn't take up enough room Not small enough  I don't like red It looks like a cla The word "mini" is an insult towards the word "small" I don't like the Wii Mini I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working I lost it under my couch  I lost it over my couch I like red so much it distracts me from the video games  Too many letter i's in the name Too much value My wife left me for one Mu second wife just left me If it had eyes, it'd have stink ones  Doesn't catch fish  Uses power  Can't palm it like a basketball Can't palm it like a football Does NOT go well on toast  Does not have shoes Doesn't last long enough to microwave  Has never tipped well at restaurants  Treats service workers poorly  Treats itself even worse
I still streetpass when I bring my 3Ds to my high school. Someone really likes Kid Icarus and Xenoblade.
Dont you just love when Scott does the Scott the woz thing
I swear hes talked about this before
As one of the 12 PS Vita owners, I have to mention this since all the others are probably still blind. I cannot believe anybody would remember Little Deviants over Welcome Park.  Welcome Park was actually just 5 "minigames" as a software pack-in but really just a human benchmark reaction, a worse 3DS sound app, a worse 3DS camera app, even worse Face Raiders, and the banger that was the skating minigame. Honestly if all 5 were as good as Skate Axis and Digit Chase, it would easily get 2 out of 3 for a pack-in.  There's also two games that I think might've made decent pack-ins:  Tearaway is self-explanatory. Similar to Astro's Playroom but it would have been cut down to half the game length if it was a pack-in.  Frobisher Says ticks the "shows off tech" box, but it's way too weird. It was free on PSN, and it's just a WarioWare type microgame collection. Fun distraction, and certainly better than Face Raiders.  If the PS Vita had a good pack-in AND had good launch software, maybe there'd be 13 owners instead.
Another good video
I kind of remember later Wii U's having Mario Kart 8 on the console. If that is included in the definition of 'Pack in games'.
I remember always seeing the 3DS come with Mario Kart 7. I know it's not really a pack in game, but with the amount of people who had it made it feel like the Wii sports for 3DS.
21:58 you mean there’s no story mode? I swear wii sports had some sorta single player right??
Atari 7800 had Asteroids Deluxe on the system (in the 80s!) and still failed commercially. That said, if you're competing against the NES in its heyday even that is not enough.
As a kid in my tiny overcrowded room with not enough room, kinetic adventures made me cry and i ended up never touching the kinetic again. I still feel guilty about wasting my parents money.
Scott the woz 💪🏼
Somebody's gotta kidney payment!!! Lovingnall the uploads lately bro!
No sticky balls?
I played the shit out of Nintendo land as a kid... I had no friends
Duck Season was my favorite wholesome SNES shooter game
Hey! Keith courage is a lot better than it seems. Plus I would use the PC engine as an example before the turbo graphics LOL. Or at least the CD add-on
The face cam in Nintendo land 🤣🤣🤣
Scott is on fire these days
I got the SNES with Street Fighter 2 pack in :) Never owned a main Mario game on this console I loved.
HOLY SHIT ITS SCOTT THE WOZ FROM ROBO ZIP
Frontiers
Motorstorm on ps3 was the best pack in
Was hoping that the steam decks pack in title would be on this list. Saying that now though I just want Scott to get the deck.
7:10 Fun fact: According to the book "Console Wars", the employees at Sega of America got a SNES and SMW on release (maybe even imported from Japan to get it faster) to scope out the competition while finishing up Sonic 1... and they thought it was a "subpar Mario" and weren't worried. They ended up being partially right, as Sonic outsold it during its release year.
Tmw Scott jokes about grandma being dead the same day my grandma gets put in the hospital due to heart failure.
Nintendo land is the only reason I ever play Wii U. Such a fun party game when I was in elementary school.
Every time I see that god damn carpet shot…I wish I never peeked behind the curtain
you don’t even understand how much it makes me happy to see that notification pop up! Hope your thanksgiving was a good one Scott thanks for everything ❤
Stop living in the past scot be scot now and not scot was
Hey Scott, now do a video on Spiritual Successors!!
I feel like a deep dive from Scott into the world of Esports and competitive video gaming like RLCS, and the world of speed running would be really interesting. Plus I feel like it would be filled with many moments with the magic of Scott.  Canonically it could be a sequel to him trying to stop having sex with donkey Kong country returns effects wearing off.
Wait, you missed Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as a pack in!!!
November 7th 1842
Watch Nintendo release a port of NintendoLand at the END of the Switch´s life
Friendly Reminder that there a handful of people out there that were born AFTER the Nintendo DS came out (in North America) that can legally vote, thanks bye
1 2 Switch felt like it should have been the Pack in Title.
The pack in games were the reason most families bought those console when they were new. NES, SNES, Game Boy, Genesis, Wii could be played right out of the box! I remember getting SNES for Christmas playing Super Mario World and just having one SNES game for nearly a year! Because cartridges were just so expensive, I was mostly renting games or borrow them from friends!
giving super mario world and astros playroom same points . ☠ scott going full tard mode sometimes
Can we all just agree that Wii sports slapped harder than uncle Rick who’s had one too many Egg Nog shots during the holidays?
Ok with sports champions the gladiator duel is so much fucking fun, I’m a sword enthusiast and I would get rlly into it, it was honestly some of the most fun I had using my body in any gaming sense, and I’ve played 30 mins of mirrors edge
Scott the Woz? More Like Scott, I love you
I never got to play Wii sports somebody stole mine and it was the only game my parents thought they could try to play tried to get another couldn't find one that works now my dad is dead and my mom is sick so to whoever is the one that stole it you ruined the chance of me playing a video game with my parents, i hope you burn in hell
Gladiator duels was goated!
0:43 That got me good.
Nintendo land was actually an unbelievable amount of fun. All the multiplayer games were a blast with friends, I was addicted to beating the solo games too
Im surprised you didn't talk about the 2ds pack in with Mario kart 7, granted you didn't do any "upgrade" handhelds like the dsi but still
I hope he talks about astros playroom edit:LET'S GOOOO
In Europe due to the awful reception of the Xbox One every Day One Edition Xbox One came with either FIFA 14 or Forza Motorsport.
"if it had eyes, it would have stink ones" - Scott "Scott The Woz" Wozniak
Finally someone talks about sports champion gladiator 💀
I'm one of 4 people on earth that seem to like 1-2 Switch, not a masterpiece by anymeans, but it's fun enough
I am very confused as to how this ratings scale works.
new comfort video 😄
I will gladly donate $100 for a Scott The Wozz Yo Kai Watch video
WHEN DOES HE STOP!?
If only we got Madden 08 as a pack in
Waiting for someone to type out that Wii mini issues list
Fact: in japan wii sports wasn’t a pack in you had to buy it separately
Scott continues to prove there is so many topics to cover in the world of video games.
RIP Hexic
Scott always uploads at the latest times in the night 💀
Spoiler alert
Please please read the “how can you be pissed off at this thing” for the Wii mini text that goes by super fast, it’s some of the funniest shit
How tf does he do it, a nearly 2 hour video and then 2 full episodes within a month of each other. Scott is on a whole new level
Nintendo Land may not have mass appeal but it sure did have me appeal. Even with Mario Kart and Smash on hand when my friends come over, we still always dust the Wii U off to play some Mario Chase and Luigi's Ghost Mansion.
Me watching every person ever gush about how perfect super mario world while i sit here having hated every minute i played of it
Yay! More Scott!
Wii Sports, Nintendo Land, Mario Kart Wii, Sonic The Hedgehog, Astro Bot’s Playroom. What you NEED In a Pack in Game.
kinda sad he didn't talk about welcome park on ps vita
Mario's definitely packin heat iykwim 😏
You should cover the Steam Deck, its literally a PC console.
Me looking at my copy of Nintendo Land that came with the black Wii U :  *is that a Scott the Woz reference?*
I was kinda late to the game for the Genesis and they must have been hurting for sales because I got with TWO pack in games. Greatest Heavyweights and Wimbledon tennis. Not a fan of boxing or tennis but I got some enjoyment from Greatest Heavyweights but never got out of the first round in Wimbledon
The early days of the 3DS were brutal. I learned how to play Street Fighter 4 though so I guess that’s cool
I'm almost positive Donkey Kong 94 was packed in with my Game Boy Pocket. Probably my favorite pack-in game ever, after the SNES that came with Donkey Kong Country later on. Another GOAT.
I love console pack-in games!!
:D
Reporter: "The last tree on Earth has just died" Me: Guiltily looking at my preorder for 24 packs of Scott trading cards... Also me: Eh, its for charity
i keep forgetting the Wii Mini exist & was a rather dumb idea considering at that point everyone was selling their used Jailbreak Wii
I had a DS at launch and played the Metroid demo a lot
I swear the font he used looks like the Attack On Titan's logo font
When I bought by switch, I also picked up Stardew Valley... but I do wish that consoles always had a pack-in, even if it's a really simple tech demo
I feel like Nintendo Land on 3DS with the tactile games like Balloon Fight or gyroscope games like DK Crash Course would’ve worked wonders as a pack in title on launch for initial sales. Change my mind.
Genuinely surprised he didn't cover Mario's Tennis on the Virtual Boy
I see scott is using more and more greenscreen footage. Nice.
This is the first Scott the Woz video since moving in to a new house
That pumpkin may not be able to play football, but at least it saves my  luigi's mansion save file
When I got a PS3  it came with toy story 3 the game and toy story 1 and 2 on Blu-ray. I think it was a good combo pack. Back in 2012
12 switch was bad and yet the switch is still one or the best selling consoles it all time
Scott using a Wii as an airplane is so ridiculously funny to me
The Wii and Wii U`s pack in games are the best. Change my mind
7:14 _Hindenburg = Mice_ fantastic reference
Wow I'm actually here within the first hour of a video being posted ladies and gentlemen we have a breakthrough
Never run out of video ideas Scott, keep em coming
Being on a big university campus in 2012 with a 3DS and Street Pass was a glorious time.
I don't care about pack-in games.....but you made me care
This guy should should have his own segment on a premium cable TV channel!
First
wow i never realized the wii mini did all those things. now i hate it too.
My switch was bundled with Botw or bundled I should say 😅
NGL I had so much fun with Sports Champions with my cousins. Its so dumb fun and the story campaign was challenging
I remember really enjoying the Vita's skateboarding game that came as part of Welcome Park (I believe it was called.) It was simple as all Hell, but I had a good time with it.
Great undone topic!
Always amazes me how Scott gets half an hour out of such a niche topic lmao
Christmas 1997 I opened up my brand new 64 got it all ready. I was the most excited I have ever been. Until I figured out my parents didn't buy a game!!! They thought it came with one!! Two months later, on my birthday, the same thing happened. I had to wait days to get a game both times because we lived in the middle of nowhere, Maine!!!
If you liked gladiator so much i recomend red steel 2 for the wii
does apature desk job count as a console pack in?
I thought AR Games and Face Raiders were really fun, back when I actually used my 3DS. I don’t even remember what other games I played on my 3DS, besides Mario 3D Land. I feel like I spent a lot more time playing AR Games than the other games I got for my 3DS
scott what do you mean little deviants that's a fucking corpse
I’d kill for a game like “astros playroom deluxe”
Scott, do you bite your fingers?
Surprised there wasnt even a passing mention of Aperture Desk Job for the Steam Deck tbh!
what's a Woz?
I was hoping Astro's Playroom would convince more devs to add gyro aiming as an option when the game could benefit from. And for 1st party games, most do and it's great that they include it. 3rd party and Ratchet and clank could learn to add it
Gonk :]
Hi!
For those confused at 16:16 (like me), allow me to explain why Scott didn't like this game.  It was actually an anime game in disguise. And a very bad one at that.
Another great upload!
the ps4 finally taught me launch titles in general are never good. now i just wait to buy the console a year =)
Sony: No self respecting adult would want a DS it’s for kids  Proceeds to sell 155 million units
This should be the pack-in video for YouTube
Look at Scotts fingers @7:31 homie looks like he's been working the field or something
I have more nostalgia for Nintendo land than wii sports
What I need is like a weekly or monthly stash video that just covers all the games scott's been playing.. no reviews or anything, just to share what he's into at that moment.
14:46
This man is a historian
I personally think Super Mario World is the absolutely perfect pack-in for the SNES, as it showcases how much versatility it had. It may not have shown off Mode 7 like other launch titles, or looked as good as Sonic or """""Altered Beast""""", but it really proved how much of a deep experience you could get with the console. It's this perfect balance of comforting and adventurous, and has a ton of content packed into a relatively short game, where every playthrough is different. Anyway, I just wanted to talk about this because I got an SNES for my birthday today, and it's one of my favorite consoles. Thanks for the amazing content as always, Scott! You're incredible!
Having read the code for Combat and even writing an Atari 2600 game while in school, the hardware is unimaginably limiting. The idea of adding an additional single player mode to combat is a monumental ask. And even if it is possible it would not be anything more than something like a space invader clone, and even that is probably pushing it.
This video is so fucking funny
“Only appeals to those with four hands or a SISTER” = gold
12:07 I feel you Scott, I feel you
Niceee!!
I set up my 3DS StreetPass Mii when I was watching South Park. So if anyone ever got an SP hit from someone who said 'muff cabbage' at them, that may have been me, sorry.
I actually go 2 pack in with the kinetic the other being carnival games action
This man could talk about a singular M&M for 17 minutes and I would hear him out with no hesitation
Can people start commenting about the actual video itself rather than Scott existing?
Ayo it came out on my Birthday, that’s funny
I swear everytime i think Scott cover all videogame topics,he always comes up with a new one
Nice
No Wii Sports Resort? Since you tackled like the other pack-ins other consoles did I was expecting Wii Sports Resorts for the new Wii Motion Plus Wii's but it is sort of the same as Wii Sports, BUT WITH SWORDFIGHTING AND BETTER CONTROLS so I personally think its better. Great video!
As a kid in the late 80s, a NES with the Mario Bros/Duckhunt cartridge was literally all you needed. The games seemed so revolutionary that just that one cart could keep you entertained for MONTHS
It's worth pointing out that Breakout is actually the only game that Scott mentioned that could have been a pack in near launch. (The other games weren't created yet) That said, I'm almost certain the version of the 2600 I got in 83 had both Combat and Pac Man as Pac ins.  Also, the Sega Master System had a pack in game, although it's a bit hard to access.
I feal like Scott is the Goat of video game content. Cause how in the damn hell do you make a video about a topic that get swept under the rug and make an entire damn video on it
The Wii Mini: Does NOT go well on toast.
26:33 The door opens up. No GameCube. It doesn't take up enough room. Not small enough. I don't like red. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting to the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter i's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes,  it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can't palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
man idk what scott is talking about dead rat soaking in water has to be one of the funnest pack in titles of all time
If  we all agree the pack-in games for Xbox Kinect and Playstation Move fit this list I feel like an honorable mention for Wii Sport Resort is appropriate because I distinctly remember it being a pack-in with the Wii Motion+
I like octopus dance 😢
Scott how could you not mention Cybermorph???
I live for new videos by Scott that I didn’t expect
Welcome Park for PS Vita also counts if Astro's Playroom does.
It's worth noting that Atari eventually included Pac Man with the system because even they recognized that Combat sucked.
you did combat dirty
Just off work watching now. Thanks Scott. Just got a new 3ds xl and this gave me some ideas lol
holy shit scott the woz on my birthday
I remember when I first got my Wii, Wii Sports really surprised my family with its extremely simple and fun gameplay. Hell, I still sometimes boot up my Wii U and play Tennis with my dad. My family just adored it.
I convinced myself Pilotwings Resort was the 3DS's pack in title, which was the only reason I forced myself to buy Pilotwings Resort with my system.
well this is the first time I ever was early for a scott the woz video lol
Who else stokin they meat
Scott is always funny
Scott, I’m concerned with the cuticle on your right thumb
14:06 make that 7 because we also got To The Earth
Scott your amazing thanks your the great videos
0/10 Doesn't last long enough in the microwave
The consoles pack in games are usually the ones you play first, the ones you have a special feeling for among the rest of your game library, and usually one you constantly return to
I had that exact Xbox 360 Elite with Pure and LEGO Batman bundle, big nostalgia punch on seeing that delightful jpeg
2022 Scott looking like What The Buck
8:21 Scott be hackin’
Wasn't the King Kong Movie Tie in Game included with the Xbox 360?
My pack in game for the ds was animal crossing wild world.
For those who don't want to freezeframe the text scroll over the Wii Mini, they say  The Door Opens Up No Gamecube Dosn't take up enough room Not Small Enough I don't like Red It looks Like a Clam the word 'mini' is insulting towards the word 'small' I don't like the wii mini I put marinara sauce on it and it stopped working I lost in under my couch I lost in over my couch I like the red so much it distracts me from the video games too many letter i's in it's name too much value My wife left me for one My second wife just left me If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish Uses power Can't palm it like a basketball can palm it like a football Does NOT go well on toast Does not fit in shoes Doesn't last long enough in the microwave Has Never tipped well at a restaurant Treats service workers poorly Treats itself even worse
"It's like an abacus- this counts."  Holy fuck this is gold
I remember that they ended up ruining the street pass on 3ds. I used to have sooooooooooo many completed puzzles and people from different countries cause I was traveling back then!
He expressed exactly how it was to be a 14 year old boy
I adored Astro's Playroom. For me that was the PS5 throwing down the gauntlet and saying this is gonna be one of those all time great consoles like the Dreamcast or the Gamecube.
cant imagine really buying a games console and then not having anything to do with it for a couple days. like sure it sucks but if you let it happen to yourself i cant feel bad for you, the gamesre prolly 2 steps away
Scott you have always good ideas of videos with humoristic touch
“Would you be rather shot for free or for 50 dollars”  - Scott Wozniak (2022)
I am honestly depressed right now and my face lit up when i saw scott uploaded! Thank you!!!!
I wish you reviewed daxter for the psp, I loved that game and I got it with the system > :|
mfw he doesnt talk about welcome park on the vita
If you want to know what to be pissed off at about the Wii Mini...  The door opens up. No GameCube. Not small enough. I don't like red. It looks like a clam. The word "mini" is insulting towards the word "small". I don't like the Wii Mini. I put marinara sauce in it and it stopped working. I lost it under my couch. I lost it over my couch. I like red so much it distracts me from the video games. Too many letter i's in the name. Too much value. My wife left me for one. My second wife just left me. If it had eyes, it would have stink ones. Doesn't catch fish. Uses power. Can't palm it like a basketball. Can palm it like a football. Does NOT go well on toast. Does not fit in shoes. Doesn't last long enough in the microwave. Has never tipped well at restaurants. Treats service workers poorly. Treats itself even worse.
Scott constantly comes up with interesting content, does substantial research, and delivers great videos. Bravo
Wait didn't Scott already make a video about bundles?
Gladiator Duel carried Sports Champions like how Atlas carried the earth.
There is a way to get more of Astro's Playroom, however it is pricy  you will need a PSVR (not PSVR2, that won't work, you need the original PSVR), Playstation Camera and a copy of Astro Bot: Rescue Mission. it's like a cute, linear Astro game which feels like Sony's first (technically 2nd) step to making their first iconic Platformer series, and Playroom is a Shorter, Non-VR, Dualsense Focused Version of it
I wanna see an upload on the extras channel where him and the boys play Nintendo land
In Australia we got Super Mario All Stars bundled with the SNES, not SMW.
Astro's playroom is the only game I've ever spedrun.
"It's like an abacus: This counts?" ~Scott
My StreetPass was super busy during my GS days years ago. I collected so many puzzle pieces it's not even funny
Where is Wii sports resort?
I hope I get my copy of Dick Vitale's Awesome Baby College Hoops as a pack in with this video!

I swear, half the time I see a Scott the Woz video in my feed I'll be like, "Sure! I can watch this again!" Only to realize it's a new video that was uploaded less than an hour ago.
Only a few days more before Scott Bitch About Christmas  2022 and Friends
Scott should do a video on movies based on video games given the hype of the Super Mario Bros Movie and with how good both Sonic movies were. And maybe as a follow up he can do video games based on movies.
I'm actually interested in finding out if Scott tried the Astros playroom challenge mode multiplayer
0:52 I had a game box that has those two exact games in it-
Nintendo Land is a classic for me. I remember playing it with my cousins all the time and it was so much fun. But as a game, it was okay I guess.
I don't need this game to act like a gorilla 😂
I’ve actually played combat on my Atari at my grandmas with my cousin it is actually a really fun game.
4:31 he look like he on a awkward video call
I wish I were a pack in console game
I'm so early I didn't have a breakdown as a Wii U owner yet

I'm so happy that Target employee can take a break sometimes to enjoy some Nintendoland
✨WET RAT ✨
4:51 You can just see how much fun target employee is having.
Already know this one’s gonna be a banger. Thanks for giving me something to listen to while I’m at work!
Just watch Scott make a video about controllers’ shoulder buttons when he’s 60
It’s always a good day when Scott uploads!!
Scott I was literally just watching a video of yours what the hell
when i was younger my dad and i played nintendo games all the time so whenever a new ds model would come out we’d sell the old one to have more money for the new one so i got my 3ds used to save money and i always wondered “what is the point of this AR stuff, where do i even get the cards?” now i finally know all these years later
Another great video !
As long as gaming exists scott will never run out of video ideas
Keith Courage deserves more than a single word, it deserves at least two.
I love your content man truly
I got my Wii U Deluxe for christmas and because it was from second-hand it didn't had Nintendo Land, but someone forgot to remove a pikmin 3 disc that was inside of the console so in the end i got something like a "Pikmin 3 Bundle Edition"
I've lost count the amount of hours i've spent on the 6 in 1 game that was bundled with the Sega Mega Drive II. Sonic 1, columns, monaco gp, sensible soccer, shinobi 2 and streets of rage
I was so disappointed that my N64 didn't come with a game, that was already expensive for my mom as it was in 1998. Silver lining was going to the local rental place and getting a game for 4 or 5 days every weekend. I got to play a lot of different games, but sometimes you need a memory card to save progress or that one time you rented Superman 64...
Is everything okay Scott you’ve uploaded too many videos this week 😳
Whenever Scott uploads a new video, it’s a good day 😁
First
How are you uploading so fast?  I'm not complaining but don't burn yourself out
The first second of this video made me think one thing  “Hey all, Scott here! I’m legally blind today. No reason. Just feel like doing it.”
Scott, please stop making 30 minute once a month videos. Please just go back to making weekly 11 minute fun videos. You dive too deep into a topic and you get too far into useless detail.
As a Wii U owner who modded it to the teeth with the entire Wii U and Wii library, and who’s played Nintendoland a ton with buddies… I still, as a lifelong IT guy and tech nerd, don’t fully grasp the purpose of the Wii U gamepad.  Only allowing 1 pad for the console? Forcing only 1 person to have a ‘gamepad’ experience, that was so different from the classic Wii nunchuck experience. It never made sense. Even in Nintendoland, with discrete ‘Zelda’ characters to take control of- 1 with the pad, up to 3 with the Wiimotes… it boggled my mind.  What if 2 wanted to use a pad? What about 3? Why and what would naturally want any one person to be singled out with a gamepad while playing with friends?
hey
What happend to your thumbs?
22:26 “Nintendo The door opens up No GameCube. it doesn t take up enough room. ugh room Wit Not small enough. I don't like red I looks like a clam.

To be fair, Altered Beast at the arcade was WAY more fun than the home port.
I’d say the best pack in console games are Tetris, Super Mario World, and the goat, Wii Sports.
I was literally just thinking about how much I want a Scott The Woz episode tonight. Also, we all know the reason Scott actually hates Little Deviants. **cough** Nintendo isn't for self-respecting adults **cough**
Astro's Playroom was so fun to play with my brother. We kept pointing out all the references and neat controller usage in the game. When we saw the Patapon reference (our 2nd favorite PS title just barely being topped by LBP), we were so damn happy. And then we found the LBP reference and basically shouted when we saw it. I loved it. On another note, seeing the mention of Nintendo Land reminded me of fond memories. It was my go-to party game of choice when my family and friends didn't feel like playing Mario Kart or Mario Party. Even outside of gatherings, it's still incredibly fun by yourself. My favorite minigame out of them all had to be Takamaru's Ninja Castle. Never played the game it's based off of, but man was it fun.
Don't put marinara sauce in your Wii Mini.
I was just talking about Wii sports being the best pack in game yesterday, must’ve been destiny for this video to happen
I actually like Altered Beast
The delivery on the cut-aways in this episode is fantastic, idk what changed but I love it
This episode feels extra crispy
Gotta appreciate Scott for keeping us entertained until he releases his big 10th anniversary Wii U video 😁👌
Scott comes up with cool ideas for video game content.
I remember playing Wii Sports so much, when I got my Wii as a kid, up until this year even! Such a magical game.
Is your thumb okay
Scott playing with the Wii reminded me of how when my sister and I were young and we played 'disc hockey' with our original copy of Wii Sports
You are a treasure Scott. I always look forward to a new video.
The only way I'd ever buy 1, 2 Switch is if it had been a pack-in. Five years later, I still don't own it.
There’s something about that ending song even tho the tv show is new and it’s not the old outro song it’s still feels nostalgia but I am mentally insane
“Don’t meet your heroes”  - Scott the met the Nostalgia critic and Angry video game nerd Woz
"And dumb, dumb, everybody's fucking dumb" Such great insight, its the kind of deep analysis that I've come to expect from Scott, it really separates his expertise from all the rest of reviewers out there.
I bought 1 2 Switch and instantly experienced existential dread.
Nintendo land was my childhood
SCOTTTT UR BLESSING USSSS ❤❤
Help I feel like I'm having a stroke. I could've sworn Scott already made a video of this topic but the comments all say otherwise. Am I losing my mind?
*Terrible Video Games With Interesting Concepts In Them!*  _Such ass_  Mindjack! Neverdead! Dark Void! Quantum Theory! Fracture! Inversion! Legendary! Vampire Rain! Alone In The Dark! Darkest Of Days!
honestly, my heart was broken when the man I love crapped on Nintendo Land.... THE BEST DRINKING MULTIPLAYER GAME EVERE
Here at 26,463 views.
"Pop in the ga... my crotch hurts."  lol
I’m really proud of myself for never buying “1-2-Switch”. Game looks like hot garbage.
hi scott the wo
Wii Sports got me laid multiple times back in the day. And for that, it will always be the best pack in title. God, I miss the late 00's.
I like funny rat
2:26 I can’t believe Scott recorded his own baby crying noise
"Wii Sports had BOWLING! Nintendoland had Octopus Dance..." Well, that's going into the quotes folder in my brain
7:29 Holy crap. You cut your thumbs. What happened?!?
every time scott uploads i throw a watch party
A pack-in title really is all I ask for in either a partner or funeral
Scott, you always make my day better. Was having a bit of a rough day and I saw a new vid. You instantly cheered me up man. Thanks for your content!
Idk what tp say so,  long before time had a name the 1st spinjitsu master created in Ninjago using 4 elemental weapons
23,938th. YAS!
“Hey I’ve seen this one before, it’s a classic!”
LMFAO  The abacus joke was perfectly on-point and subtle
Hey y’all Scott here
Me kicking my feet into the air when Scott uploads
Scott’s videos are like his games: they materialize out of thin air.
scott uploading on my birthday is an amazing birthday gift
Ooooo Yeaa 🎉
Scott will play Gex but not Keith Courage, for shame.
Its gonna be a great day when scott uploads
It seems like Sony is the only trooper remaining when it comes to pack in titles. With Astro’s playroom being pre installed on every PS5, it’s the only full blown game to be packed into the system.
Dang! We’ve have new Scott videos up the WOZoo! WHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA
I wonder what game will be packed in to the next episode of Scott the woz
As soon as Scott mentioned streetpass I remembered I had my 3DS with me all day... And I actually got some hits. What a beautiful feeling
I sold the N64 I had as a kid and a Dreamcast I bought when I was younger to a coworker who wanted them for his small kids to play.  I asked him 12 years later if he'd part with them and he pretended it never happened.  I can't blame him.  haha.
7:16 Frick zodiac signs, is slope-intercept form y=mx+b or y=mx+d
New Scott the Woz, LFG BOYS!! 🙌
No one has finished this video yet
I’ll have you know Scott I’m a goddamn menace at Gorilla I always attract that gorillussy
In a way packins have kinda evolved into game services now consoles come with a ton of games for a monthly subscription sure it isn't free with the console but you get alot of bang for your buck
Astro’s Playroom is one of my favorite PS5 games and it’s a tech demo
Wii Sports was and always will be the greatest legend among casual gamers
Nice to see Gurumin downloaded on the 3DS.
Screw studying for finals, it’s Scott time
30 seconds in and I'm already snickering, keep doing what you're doing man.
Scott should've talked about ps4's pack in, a game that requires the ps camera which needed to buy separately.
Charity and a new video in less than a week! Congrats on the 200k! I hope you take a nice long break when it's all said and done.
yo i just wanna watch all his vids now
My sleep schedule<New Scott the Woz Video
The king of box in games will always be wii sports resort
Of course Scott started with the Wii U. Folks, I think he is obsessed.
" It's considered a pack in title... so is _settings!_ " Great, now I got to clean my TV from this tea I just spat out from laughter—thanks.
Tomorrow is friday and Scott just uploaded. Could it get any better?
I don’t think I’ve ever been this early… 😅
Ok but the absolute best pack-in game out there is 3D Pinball Space Cadet for Windows XP.
first
I actually have "Has been Heroes" It's fun as fuck actually. I think it does well to show single player pick up and play action that the Switch tried to sell you on, it was simple enough to play on the go but had enough depth to be a console game. To be factual though, it only shows 1 selling point of the Switch. Fun game, spent hours on it without realizing, 8/10.
1-2 switch says hello
I am constantly impressed with Scott’s ability to make retro subjects out of thin air
Scott is the only one on here who doesn't even need to try to clickbait.
An awesome thing about Astro's Playroom is that there's a speedrun mode. For speedrunners, it could be a really fun competitive experience. There's always room for a faster time and not to mention the speedrun scene is pretty obscure and niche, but it is always fun to share world records or find new techniques to speedrun the game or the mode.
4:51 Target Employee Jumpscare
That has been heroes joke… that’s a deep one…
Nice one lad
Scott’s collectible cards for the charity event can technically be counted as packed-in games but replace games with Scott videos
scott the woz
I got Infamous, Batman Arkham Asylum, and The Dark Knight on blu ray for no charge with my PS3 slim 😎
Scott I am calling the Police on you. The box clearly says not for resale (2:40)
the l button video is gonna shatter the multiverse as we know it
Holy shit its scott the woz
hey scott, all here.
Impossibly based and Sussy Baka Nae Nae pilled
Why does Scott's nose looks bigger?
Scott has so many fresh ideas! That’s beautiful!
After watching the charity video I was all like thanks for the early Christmas present, but then he posts this  Exactly like a console plus game bundle
An improvement to my week... My life every time he uploads
Scott the Woz the only channel that gives me a great podcast to listen to on my commutes and help me to fall asleep (I have to listen to podcast style videos to help me fall asleep, it’s not because it’s boring it just helps calms my nerves and not think about the day)
I was just watching your videos earlier
lol
Yea
First thing I watch in the morning
Snow day AND a new Scott video!!!
Had to disagree on the Super Mario World part. The hype was real. It may not look like it now but it was mind blowing at the time. The music, the colors, the improved graphics. It felt revolutionary. It's just hard to see with modern eyes. You kinda had to be there.
has anyone asked a developer/publisher why they don't put physical discs with consoles or with collectors editions? A disc shouldn't be that expensive to add in
Playstation 5 does not count because the PS5 is not real
"How will U play next"  is why the wii u failed
wendy's employee cameo 5:50
0:32 "My crotch hurts."  Don't worry, I hear you can play Donkey Kong Barrel Blast to alleviate that.
My Wii U gamepad has drift so seeing Scot use the right stick on his without it breaking is giving me Wii U envy
How does Scott upload a movie, then not to long after release a new video. Your spoiling us Scott
I image Scott just wakes up and draws a random slip of paper with a video idea
It goes to show anyone can be a YouTuber if he can do it. And he’s in Ohio.  ( this meme is still relevant right? )
AYYY ITS SCATT
What’s everyone’s vote for “BEST PACK IN GAME EVER”?
An 10:30pm upload.  👍
This is a hot take but for me with friends nintendo land is the best game on the Wii U
Ayo more backround noise for homework
3 minute's late 💀
Love when you upload Scott. Love your content
Dang it Scott, here you are to make my day better again! Thank you for that.
Schlatt's gonna be happy
I...i like Nintendo Land
WII SPORTSSSS
Truly one of the best “Scott The Woz Console Pack-In Games” videos of our generation
oh lets go more virgin vlogs to appease my inner 🤓
What an Intro that was! Always love it when there is a new Scott The Woz video, I know I'm in for a Good Time.
Hey all! Early gang here!!
*49 secs ago*
Big chungus gungus
I use my Wii in the same way, I don't see the problem
First we get games with consoles as a bundle, and now games with consoles WITHOUT a bundle? Scott really out did himseld here
I sing the national anthem with my chorus class tomorrow at hockey game
I had Nintendo Land included in a Mario Kart 8 Wii U Bundle BEFORE it was cool.
everytime i wonder when he'll upload, there he is
Oh hello Scott
this is the shortest amount of time between episodes this year
2 videos in 3 days? Are you trying to save the world?
Never been this early!
Always a good time you watch a Scott vid
Let’s go more Scott
Oh boy, 6 minutes ago!
This man can make a video game video about anything and I love it
Scott, as a fellow ohioan, it's 10:30. Go to bed
hello scottothan
4:31 “Wii Sports had bowling, Nintendo Land had Octopus Dance.” That killed me 💀
Combat?  No?
One word tetris.
Life always good when Scott uploads
0:23 This made me burst out laughter
"five minutes ago"  I havent been this early in a LONG time, holy hell :O
Lol, What an Intro, Always love it when there is a new Scott The Woz video. I'm in for a Good Time.
late upload, i like it
very cool!
"Thank God, I'm allergic to deals" - Scott (20??)
I wish for my first console of being born to reality, I was bundled in with Scott. Like a twin. That was kinda odd, sorry
Just got home and I am REWARDED with fresh, hot Scott the Woz!
this video came as a pack in with the notification squad package
man’s always finding new topics to talk about and make a video out of, and i’m all for it
Scott if you ever run out of incredibly obscure video game topics to talk about I'll have you know I would love to see you take up juggling.
wet rat
fist
The second I go downstairs to get dinner, bam, Scott upload  Great service!
I got the lego movie the video game with my Xbox one, and that’s my experience with pack in games
It's funny seeing how I just got my ps5 last week with the God of war ragnarok bundle. Finally finished installing like after a week and now you upload this lol
Shame they rarely do this these days. Like if I paid $600 for an XBOX One X; Is it so hard for Microsoft to throw me a bone and give me The Master Chief Collection for free?
OhI0
23:53 why do you hurt us so?
Yesss we needed this. I thought it would be a long time after the donation extravaganza
When Scott said "My crotch hurts", chills ran down my spine
Congrats on raising $200,000 in the first few days of the charity event Scott!
scott the woz? at this time of year? at this time of day? localized on my personal computer?
the dumbest thing is when they bundle in something non exclusive
If scott was a console he’d come packed with pepto-bismol and an extra long manual to read on the ride home.
I think the switch not coming with 1 2 switch during it's launch was a missed opportunity. Obviously it would never be a replacement for something like Wii sports, but having to buy the game separately seems to be that games downfall. I feel more people would've been interested in the game if it came with their console. When I got my switch, I was shocked to find out 1 2 switch wasn't a pack-in game.
Console bundle and special editions were the ones that would be the quickest to take advantage to console pack ins
1 minute in and 800 likes
This amount of StW content coming in at the end of the year is just what I wanted for Christmas🥹
Is Scott short for Scottington
The best pack in game is “How Long Will it Take To Clean Up All The Crumbled Styrofoam”
i thought he gave away the blue border after the last video, glad to see it back!
I was about to go to sleep to prepare for god knows what tomorrow… but this is a better use of my time
Holy shit it’s Scott the Woz
Whenever a new Scott vid comes out most of us legit instantly watch it
Scott wearing his glasses over his blindfold just makes sense.
Scott is grinding this year
Is it a bad thing that the first thing I noticed is that scott didn't shave.
WAKE UP BABE, NEW SCOTT VID
Hey Here Scott All
got here before the notification did, good stuff 👌
SCOTT SCOTT SCOTT SCOTT
166th
everytime i begin to watch older videos he uploads very soon after
How the hell every time I remind myself of Scott he posts a couple hours later?
Hi scott
Best review channel 😂
Fuckkk yeahhhhh
I keep Wii Sports on a f*cking easel, that game is incredible
We love watching one of scotts old videos right before he uploaded the new one then switched right to it
Just what I needed before bed tonight. Thanks Scott!
I've never clicked so fast
I clicked faster than sonic the hedgehog from sonic frontiers: available in stores now!
Blindfold is a good look for Scott. He should do it more often, well outside of a vehicle I mean.
Man, Scott The Woz is a great YouTuber to watch when you are tired or bored
Babe wake up, New scott video dropped
Thank you Scott, very cool.
We should thank Nintendo for giving us wii sports. Sad that bundles aren’t as iconic as that one anymore
Feel like I've seen this video before...
I always appreciated pack in games!
1 minute there's already 100 comments, this really shows how excited we get every time Scott uploads
Let’s go, Scott the Woz video in December before Christmas
The Scat Man is here
I've always wanted a new Scott The Woz episode on console pack-in games on a Thursday night. My prayers have been answered!
Please talk more about LEGO Dimensions. Or LEGO Games in general. I NEED MY LEGO GAMES QUOTA FILLED!!!

Scott making airplanes sound while holding a Wii is not something I thought I needed today

Ah yes, Scott’s back.
EVERYBODY STOP DOING WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING SOUND THE ALARMS SCOTT UPLOADED ANOTHER VIDEO 🎉🎉🎉
It wasn't enough for Scott to launch his charity event with 57 trading cards and exclusive videos, 2 sets of the mysterious game of crypticism with a pack in CD and comic, and tons of poster and t-shirt variants. He also uploads a 30 minute video within the same 3 days! We don't deserve this man.
Best YouTube notification <3
Scott rants about 1-2-switch for 30 minutes:
they were packed in
what a pure blind experience
noti
