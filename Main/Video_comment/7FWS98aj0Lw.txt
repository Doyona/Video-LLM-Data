Courtney screaming in the back during Tommy's bit fried me 😂
I have the same socks that Tommy wears as Mental Illness 🙈
The better punchline for the bop It joke would’ve been, “Why do you have the high score?,”
Love the vibe police
And thus, mental illness became a reoccurring character
During Courtney’s one where they were wearing a safety ring and a lobster claw talking to Shane, their impression voice sounded like a more gruff Bernie Sanders
10:20  🐵: “Ow! Ow! Ow!”
So glad I found this one again! This has one of my Favorite Tommy bit series! the Dog judge evolution deserves its own full skit.
Who’s here in 2025?
without Angela around, Courtney looks like the crazy one
13:51 Anchorman Reference
The speedboat bit was amazing
was this the origin of the chosen
I really want to see something like one of Tommy’s extended SNL bits (like his “STOP bit,” ✋) filmed as a sketch, with various different characters all played by Tommy and responding to one another.   Something about the way his characters are semi-self aware enough to articulate the bizarreness of their own reality/behavior while continuing to carry on as if everything’s normal just feels like its own universe, like some Rick and Morty-esque fever dream.
My favorite bit from Noah is “Rave Noah”! 🤣😂🤣
Goooooood Tommy is so handsome 😭
The birth of one of the best recurring characters of all time
Tommy! 😂❤😂
Is Shayne’s laughter the main cause so many break? I’m guessing so. 🤣
For anyone here after the wedding; I truly believe that the Vibe Police is just how they introduce anyone coming to their home for the first time.
Courtney's peaches bit was so funny I died laughing
12:37 one of the best bits of all time
0:21 Anthony must not have made anyone laugh!!! 😂😂😂
Courtney looks great
If my mental illnesses personified themselves and started talking to me, I would take myself the mental ward.
That horse at the beginning of minute 7 is built like a camel 🐪
R1: Shayne R2: X R3: Courtney* R4: Shayne* R5: Tommy* R6: Tommy
I need a tie dye " I'm your mental illness" hoodie like rn
Shayne's laugh makes me smile so much!
We need Shayne to bring back Sonny Malone
How did Jackie not get the dog show joke?? He literally did it before that
Kimmy looked good in that black dress  Why can’t we get more Courtney freaking killer??  Boneless always comes back
Was this the debut of Mental Illness?!
12:42 the moment from the beginning of the video
“You’ve got big old eyes, like a sexy fish.” 😂
🥰🥰🥰😂😂😂
10:43 Noah's realisation at "Pissy the Clown" is hilarious
Was this the first appearance of mental illness?
The vibe check kills me
Jackie taking Courtney’s intro to heart and now she’s gone 😭😭😭 I’m gonna miss her so much
I think noahs Titanic bit proves that if you say something isn't funny it makes it 70% funnier
✨it is me your metal illness. ✨🤣🤣🤣
Tommy killed it this episode
I love the mental illness character so much
You linked the wrong video
Link in description isn't the right video
As the proud father of a pet skunk, I can attest that Kimmy's reaction at 12:20 is both realistic and based on a true story
Courtney's beaver is the MVP of this episode. No. Contest.
2:36 I live solely for that bit
I hope the mental illness character keeps being played lol. It’s my favorite character
Honestly I need to see way more of Tommy being mental illness like can we have a series with that? 😂🤣🤣
5:33 either that is a Webkinz signature bull terrier or it is a very close lookalike. I appreciate it. I have a Webkinz signature bull terrier and it is one of my favorite characters in my collection.
14:08 the build up for the pieno just to not use it made that so much better than i thought!
As someone who watched the Goldbergs before watching Smosh, I cannot tell you how excited I was when I saw Shane
Everyone: *one small laugh into harmonica* Shayne: *literally hyperventilates into the harmonica*
Kimmy does indeed have horse girl length hair
12:37
I love how accurate the "Mental illness" Tommy plays is!!
Kimmy faut
Courtney in jeans kills me, she looks so fucking good
Kimmy, usually when a skunk stamps his feet, that is a warning. Usually the spray after that.
i also cry when something is so cute
Mental illness the character persona is a mad lad that is soo funny lol
Vibe check was absolutely the best one of them all.  "vibrator" was hilarious
Shayne who is supposed to be your lawyer says " you're fucking going to prison"
Courtney's "boneless" bit is peak TNTL comedy and nothing will come close imo
Vibe police🤣🤣🤣
Kimmy seems like the sort of domesticated woman who's very comfortable being oppressed.
I need Tommy to continue his "mental illness" character
All the dog show bits were fantastic.  I especially loved the monkey one
Noah's Titanic was so funny!  How'd Jackie not laugh 😂
"Barry Goldberg what are you doing? 😂
Everyone brought it in this episode! I loved every bit😂
I don't know why Kimmy's society bit broke me but it did😂
The Chosen gets me every single time 😂😂😂
6:30 that was literally everything
As someone from Florida, the manatees one was fucking hilarious  Those poor manatees almost always have propeller scars
The “MY FAVROT PIZZA PLACE ☎️” will never get old
Okay, I scrolled through this comment section for a while and it's seriously nobody gonna mention Kimmy crying from being overwhelmed by cute animals?  That is so frikkin adorable
2:56 the hesitation makes it so funny 😂
I'm so here for that dog show joke and how much Courtney enjoyed it.
the vibe cops must be one of my absolute favorite duos. shayne and Courtney together are truly unstoppable
12:37 15:21
Two of my favorite Tommy Bowe characters in the same video.
The dog show bit is so funny because it's insanely accurate while also being inaccurate all at once and it's just so great 😂😂
First round as soon as Shayne walked in I knew what was happening.
Vibe secured
When Courtney first walked out as Boneless she sounded like a Honda Civic 😂 13:01
Me totally expecting the shayne bop it skit to end with “well i guess at least I can still pull it” 😂
🤣🤣 “why is your left arm buffer than the other?”🤣
Lmao "Vibe-Rater" is 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Like the best ever characters in this episode.
Tbh… This the best episode of Kim showing his skills. Usually she’s not that funny for me, but on this episode she clapped it.🫶🏿
Shayne predicted the Depp v Heard trial 10:22
Man where can I buy that monkey
Awesome
0:30 where'd the stool go?
The damn monkey puppet is my FAVORITE prop 😭🤣 And boneless is my favorite character from Courtney 💀 Also from tommy is definitely the mental illness character
I REALLE lik Kimmy squatting lik that 👍🏻. Lool
The lore of Shanes characters are insane
This is Noah's best video hands down
I love when people react to Noah with complete bafflement 🤣 he's so effortlessly funny in everything!
i love try not to laugh
kimmys jokes are so funny
Why is Tommy so handsome? I just can't :/
The way Tommy does his characters is hilarious
This is TNTL with literally all my favourites.. except Ify. I know he doesn’t really count but yeah.
Tommy's Mental Illness character is my all-time favorite.  I laugh because I know.  I hope we get to see more of them!
"You're  gonna have to leave forever "  Like Anthony
noahs titanic bit was so simple yet so so funny i literally died laughing
Mental illness is my friend now
7:13 I though he meant to call her a bitch- 🙊
The plate snap LMAOOOOO
15:09
I want the vibe police to return!!!!!!!!!!
Tommy’s “mental illness” is what I imagined my mental illness to look like. I also love the “American”Russian astronaut.
I finally figured out Jackie, she doesn't have jokes, she just does a "goofy" voice and gets loud. Such talent
Personally loving the new lore integrations to Pizza Place, perfectly in sinc with previous characterization, not too complicated for new players, and the world building is phenomenal.
In the nicest most non-hostile way......why does it feel like if mental illness tommy bones started bobbing his head back and forth he would just turn into he-man....then shane and kimmy just be like "what's goin on?"
10:22 was literally my experience with Marc James Small, Attorney at Law.  BEFORE he lost his ability to practice law...
14:18 THEY SOUND LIKE DAFFY DUCK
The uranus is funny
0:14 what the hell is she tying to adjust  down there :D
"HALLO SHAY-EEN, ITS ME YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS!" i cry every time
This is the only time i want a mental illness to stay
Cuz we are  *SEAMEN
This was posted on my birthday lol
this was on my birthday and i never kneww!!!!!!!
"It's unpasteurized!" was so funny
I need a skit(I'm sorry if I spelled that wrong) between "mental illness" and "confidence" arguing over who will be the dominant emotion of the day
Tommy. Hi Shane I’m your mental illness  Me. Hahhahahahahah I’m dieing
3:33  why she sound like dextor!?!?!?!
I need to be here. I wanna play this !
NEW TNTL IDEA: Each person has to make the other laugh as fast as possible. The person with the least amount of time accumulatively in the end is the winner 🤙
That was the best Justin beiber
Oh hi there. I’m your mental illness.
I love that Shayne brought back the loan!!!
Is it just me or does the harmonica look like a pickle the entire time👀
I CAME HERE FOR THE CLOWN LAWYER I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS WAS THE EPISODE WITH MY MENTAL ILLNESS
That is mental illness
I just love the monkey so much it makes me laugh
9:52
WE NEED MORE MENTAL ILLNESS! XD this got me dying. because like... its so true XD
Hands down the mental illness for the win
With the planet one she should have casually added "the moon" just for the laughs
Anyone know what the "Uh Oh, Society" meme was referring to?
10:21 This would've made a great Smosh and Order episode
0:30 where did the stool go?
Jackie seems like the person who would give the best hugs. Also I want Tommy to impersonate my mental illness.
Vibe-rator eyyyy hahaha
69k likes this is a sign for me to actually go outside
It amazes me how y’all can bleep words like: f**k, sh**, etc.. But y’all allow “God da**” to be said without any kind of censoring… So sad!
Jackie is unfunny
17:10
Tommy Is my favorite always.
I would die if I met my mental illness 👁👄👁
I- I DID IT I FINALLY FOUND THERE CHANNEL AGAIN YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Tommy's mental illness character reminds me of Baron the Roëmænce Partnær from Dimension 20 lol
17:12
you know what.."The social anxiety monster" is my favourite honestly
Favoritepizzaplaceverse
This was one of Noah's best TNTLs
Oh no a wave.
Courtney talks like mike tv from willy wonka
0:30 tripped me out, where'd the stool go? xD
I want to see a character generator episode for BONLESS' crew
AHHHH mental illness is a mood.
if you watch all 88witch out smiling you get a slap in d face by the smosh creater him self...joke this is not a joke he gonna do it... because he he gonna be insulted that you dint even make a smile for 88 episode...
12:35 hello
Sad Kimmy is sad! Aw, you’re still my favorite pizza topping ^_^
Why is the stool missing at 0:30?
Wow that vibe check was a flawless philly accent from Shayne 17:10
So sad when bits get ruined/fail because people just don't get them. Unless the bits were filmed in a different order to how they were shown i don't get how it happened this time though
Bro I fuckin love Tommy 🤣🤣🤣he's too funny omlll 🥰🥰❤️
I come back to this video at least once a week for "don't mind him, he gets his peaches out in Georgia"
Tommy's mental illness character is so iconic
You know what? I get the Hey Arnold thing, super cool...
JACKIE IS THE FUNNIEST PERSON ON SMOSH. I know i'm biased because my name is also Jackie but its true. She is queen.
i want courtney's shoes, imma buy them :)
the way tommy walks when he is "your mental illness" tho lmao
Tommy: "It is me, your sleep paralysis demon" *weird creepy smile* reminds me of  Ify: "I'll be your sleep paralysis demon for the night" *intense stare*
I want to meet Shayne and give him a high-five.
Are the two people who play the vibe police brother and sister?
I love Boneless
Dumpster fire SNL. ❤I love ya'll
I miss Jackie so much
I think useing a harmonica should be the new "Hard mode" because they can't grip their lips to stifle a laugh.
Courtney's deep voice isn't funny.
the mental illness skits had me rolling, absolutely spot on. 😂
Some of this stuff, I really couldn't find funny. Until I realized, I would die immediately if a friend was in some silly get-up while I was trying not to laugh. It's the connection, the friendship, that makes us laugh at stupid shit. I did find most slits clever, it just didn't appeal to me because I have yet to form a connection from a viewer's standpoint. I can't wait until I die at everything.
Im waiting for the skit where they come out in a prisoners outfit and ask for their phone call and their phone call is "yea pizza hut your my favorite"😂
i love the "I see you're having a good day so far but have you considered, not having one?"
Vibe policy needs to comeback
Tommy should absolutely have a spot on the regular cast if he doesn’t already (new fan so I’m not sure), between this and the drag university graduation ceremony from a previous TNTL he’s had some of the most well-considered and hilarious bits for me.
Something about the way The Chosen (Delivery Boy edition) said "I must warn you" made me wish Dumpster Wizard would appear somewhere in the video...
Can someone explain me Shayne Joke of “Berry Goulburn” (that is what I think he said)? It was at around 6:40. Appreciated!
pls vibrate a tropical smoothie cafe pls
Did anyone else notice how the chair vanished in the first cut
One of my favorites when Tommy's dog judge character is the one being judged by the monkey! When Courtney comes out just clapping those little monkey hands while fucking crouched down like a little gremlin is the BEST.
"Vibe secured."
3:00  PLS THIS KILLED ME WGEFWGFIWHFU
i’m glad they brought back the harmonica 💗
All units be Advibed
Anyone else wonder where the stool went at 0:30 like it was there then it was gone.
Thanks for making me laugh on a shitty day
Courtney and Kimmy would be great besties xD
lol jackie went from being russian to french in seconds lol
Noah's hair color is like my mental illness, there seems to be a new one every week
Jackie isn’t funny.
Vibe Police needs to be a full thing
17:15 Love this guys accent 🤣
I just realized when Apocalyptic Courtney starts her bit with Shayne, her opening noises are literally just the ghosts’ voice lines from Luigi’s Mansion
When did the chosen join the cast of two and a half men?
Subtitles: crowd laughing  Reality: Shayne laughing
Jacklyns just annoying
Hated the harmonicas.
9:19 For a moment I thought she was going to say: So, you must be the new cow
Why this Afro American is so boring?
Tommy and Courtney with the monkey clapping totally killed me 💀 amazing
BONELESS!
Shayne and Damien are the kings, but I feel like Tommy is EXTREMELY underrated
I love mental illness 🤣
No one cares Matt Bradley
“The Dairy Queen” really got me for some reason 😂
Jackie's first bit sounded like Dexter from Dexter's Lab.
Tommy had me there with the dog 😭🤚
The idea that Jackie needs skinny hurts me because i find her by FARRRRR the most attractive member of smosh, physically and almost mentally. (Sorry, jackie, im in love with tomey)
This is one of the best ones.
1:49 Shayne looks like Guy fieri
It sounds like they’re always about to start playing piano man
Boneless strikes again👊🤣🤣🤣
Ah yes, my favorite part is when the *(high tea music)* starts (9:51)  Captions are wonderful
I'm imagining a bit here. > Lights go out. > "I've been trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty for 37 years, Bob." except it's in the "HALLO IT IS ME YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS" voice. > "I never stopped believing, Bob. Not even when your chihuahua tried to have me silenced. I. Never. Stopped." This is all softly whispered into someone's ear from behind of course.
Tommy Shane and Damien are the best
When courtney was laughing in a deep voice it sounded Exactly like pennywise
How bloody good is kimmy!!
Shayne's loan bit came back!
Noah on the 'make Tommy Laugh' bit he did made me think of that 'Last Friday Night' Katy Perry song and he just woke up from that world/fantasy from that party and kept partying.
2 vs 2 teams try not to laugh, 2 cast do the funny and 2 tnt. might work.
So whens IFY coming back???
LMAO PISSY THE CLOWN
I feel like not enough people are talking about "why was Arnold from Hey Arnold so hot?" because that whole bit absolutely slayed me!
Noah's bit with Jackie reminds me of early 2000 - 2010 memes.
Shayne and Courtney work together well in their bits, like the vibe police one in this episode and also the alien one when they did Smosh Live.
The cybergoth dance gets me every time
Courtney’s love affair with this puppet makes me so unbelievably happy
Tommy breaking that plate out of nowhere is genuinely threatening
heyloaw, its mayh, your meyntayil iealneas
Fun fact: nuclear rain tastes like cinnamon
Viberadar is fucking amazing
SPAYYYCE 🌎 ⭐️ 🪐
Literally everyone of them is funny except Jackie lmao
i have never in my life seen someone who has the same phone case as me until now and i have never felt so fulfilled in my life. kimmy i love you and your taste in decorative and functional cellphone casing, do the chips on your cards also shit out after like 4 months??
i just love the peaches out in georgia monkey
Shane’s iconic “so you must be the new___”  So you’re the new assasino”
Oreee poli.... Oru raksheem illla.... 🤣🤣
At the beginning, right before Shayne shouts "let's go" the stool is there, but when it sooms in then back out, the stool is gone.
Honestly, I thought brain-plunger was pretty genius. Just the right amount of unpredictable absurdity.
Shayne: *adds Favorite Pizza Place lore* Moments after that: *Pizza Hut ad plays*
*Break The Plate 2021*
Kimmy brings up her height quite a bit. Does she need a hug from a taller person?
An entire TNTL without Olivia? Yes, please!
TOMMY'S HUMOR ALWAYS GETS ME HAHAHAAHAHAHA
My bf and I have been quoting Tommy's "it is me your mental illness" bit ever since we saw this 😂 cracks us up every time
13:25 has the same vibe as the kid who has never been on live television before
If the vibe police were the actual police, I think we’d have a lower crime rate
We need more Barb Ross!
The skunk stomping is actually a warning that it’s about to spray.
0:27 stool gone... just gone.
I love Mental Ilness
As someone who deals with a personal mental disorder on the daily Tommy's mental illness gag actually makes me laugh and helps me cope. I love it and watch it whenever I need a laugh
Barry Goldberg what are you doing? Haha
Kimmy is my favorite lmfao hilarious
The mental illness bit is fucking amazing
Tommy’s actually a genius with the continuity between sketches
13:00 what's pennywise doing there
2:44 Getting Psychonauts vibe there
10:20 Courtney is literally three here 😂
Kimmy is so hilarious! Such a great episode!
4:52 This....this is art
There should be a sketch with the vibe check duo in the smosh office 🤣
I'd like to start a petition for Kimmy, the world's cutest, to be sponsored by Ray Ban.
His vibrator😂
I wish I could be in this show 😂
FFS Courtney is literally perfect
not the "vibe rater"
"Hello Shayne , it's me your mental illness" I lost it
Tommy’s mental illness character was too real for Shayne and Kimmy
When she said emergency vibe check  I half expected her to pull out a fake gun
I know there's another episode with the "vibe police" in it, someone pls tell me which one it is.
Tommy is comic genius while shayne is an creative artist... Its banger for us
Vibe officers in public is a necessity at this point
Yes Jackie yes you did
I realise that I a queer woman pretty much own the exact same clothing as Shayne.
Unpopular Opinion: Jacklyn isn’t funny
why is tommy the funniest person on cast besides shayne and damien? XD
0:57 when she smiles this girl looks like riley reid
OMG Courtney with her Justin Beiber impression😂😂😂 repeatedly watching and lmao each time🤣
Courtney's monkey skit was per-fect
Courtney was so funny. Come on. Hot girl summer? More like it's hot because it's the apocalypse LOL
I don't know how you can't laugh at shaynes bit with Tommy. omg 😂😂
Country and the monkey should have their own show.
I reiterate, shaynes clown bit was freaking hilarious. I came back and watched the bit again multiple times. We need more!
Vibe was indeed secured
I gotta say the soundtrack is definetely an upgrade
Pig Noah: 10:43
Okay but is anyone else thinking how adorable it was that Courtney was so exited to help Tommy for his dog show bit?? Like the pure joy on her face was absolutely amazing
Shayne, please continue using Bupas the clown as a character. That bit just got funnier and funnier
4:57 what meme is that how do I find it???
I freakin lost it when Shayne said " My vibrator is picking up 0 freakin vibes"
Shayne breaking character in the clown bit is just the funniest thing to me🤣🤣🤣
Honestly the mental illness makes me wanna say "hey what's going on".
I love Kimmy <3
I like the intimidating Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure aura Courtney’s outfit has
Im just a simp man, i see Courtney, i click
0:30 wAIT WHY IS THE STOOL GONE WHERE DID IT GO
Shayne saying ok now you can legally look at me 😂😂
Nobody talking about how pretty Courtney looks here
i actually find jackie's humor unbearable and in all honesty I would much rather swan dive into a fucking spiked pit.
I subscribed because my mental illness is on the intro
words that sound dirty but arent: vibe radar
i think tomy and jaq is suspended try to watch the latest in smosh i commented here something about jaq from this video i think there is some.bad blood between the those 2 individuals...
the first smosh vid i watch ever since anthony left, what the fuck
14:08
where Kieth?
BEST TRY NOT TO LAUGH CAST RIGHT HERE
This is the TNTL I've rewatched the most now, I actually super enjoy this episode in particular for some reason.
The chosen is the funniest character ever! Shayne is amazing I hope he's contracted to smosh for life
If y’all sold that monkey puppet as merch I’d buy five
Vibe-rator xD
WHY IS THERE A MOVING GREEN WORM IS IT ALIVE 11:19
if 5'7 is tall than australians are giants
14:08
Does anyone else feel like Noah just isn't feeling the vibe anymore? I feel like he has just been faking his laughter for the past few try not to laughs that he's been in. Hope you're doing okay, Noah. <3
I think that's just what shaynes brain looks like in general
How tf is there 74 of these
Shayne loves his vibrator
jackie's trying so hard it's ironic making it funny, was this her intention? i'm beginning to question reality
You should put a go pro on the subject's head so we can see stuff from their pov
I want to see the shayne  cinematic universe
the "im your mental illness" always got me :)
I need to more Jackie singing
I just realized that *Courtney* looks like Kris from *CallmeKris*
One of my fav episodes I love this lineup
6:41
I NEED A DYLAN OBRIEN COLLAB WITH TRY NOT TO LAUGH
Why have I been watching these all day?!   _You_ know why...
Jackie is actually unfunny. :/
12:43 iconic.
i need to know where Mr Shayne buys his frickin' jeans
Courtney‘s eyeliner skills now please
I just want Courtney and Jimmy's workout routines
matt shea
Honestly, Courtney has some really specific, really awesome voice acting talent
10:21 Why is Art Garfunkel here?
You ever just
I need kimmy in my life 🤣💜
This team plus Damien vs Gus would be the dual of the century. They just need strategy
Dude, this is without a doubt one of the absolute funniest TNTL I've ever seen. Kimmy is a FANTASTIC addition
I LIVE FOR BONELESS
Jackie not playing the piano killed me
A well deserved hug after that intense cardio workout. 😭😭
PLEASE kimmy came in Swinging
I literally made my mom come in for Shane's Goldberg bit because SHE LOVES the goldbergs
Why does Tommy's mental illness character look just like the He-Man meme? I just keep expecting him to come out singing the song.
Finally a follow up to the Bunny man and his loan and more …Boneless!  I’d like to add “I’m your mental illness” as my new favorite character
Needs saige. Also i volunteer to guess star that episode
my favorite bit ever was from the early ages of try not to laugh where shayne asked for the bank loan and im so happy to see it brought back
Kimmy is just so pretty
Yo I can’t help but love Courtney she’s so fucking perfect !!!!! Fml man lol
"Barry Goldberg, what are you doing"  -matt Bradley
The Justin impression omg😂😂
Courtney eyeliner is so good ><
Kimmy talking about skunks is the most adorable thing ever
Courtney finally stepping up here game
“I’m Andrew Jackson…”  Hoo boy I thought that joke was going somewhere else. ☠️
Isn’t kimmy only 5’7? How is that tall even for a girl
I wonder why they brought back the harmonicas? I kinda liked the normal “just dont burst out laughing”
I really like Jackie she reminds me of a female Jordan Peele
Hear me out try not to laugh but you can only use you most popular characters
I love Shane's callback to that character  🤣🤣🤣
11:30 and that just slapped.
1:43 Shayne should have voice acted on south park..
I love how half of Courtney’s bits consist of her holding 50 things and wearing stuff on her head and the lobster claw
Not this vid the channel
I'm not sure how I remember I watch this like 5 year ago
I need a Kimmy in my life
11:10 as someone who had to study The Tempest for IB, I have absolutely no idea wtf this joke is or what its about. But with Tommy its hilarious either way
We need the water back. Mouth organ just isn't doing it for me.....Giggidy.
Jackie when she went against Tommy sounded like Dexter SOOO MUCH or is it just me? Also Jackie Slayed it in this one overall but Tommie clearly had the best joke.
"Try Not To Cry Challenge:" It's just Kimmy sitting on the hot seat the whole time while everyone shows her cute animal videos, and whoever makes her cry the hardest wins
The loan bunny is back! I'm so happy 😂
Boneless gets me every time. Well done!
As someone with pretty significant anxiety/OCD issues, I can confirm that Tommy’s depiction of mental illness is *100% accurate*
“You’re my favourite pizza place” bit and The Chosen One bit have combined the Shayne Universe continues to grow
So is the loan gonna go through or what?
⚠️ IDEA FOR TRY NOT TO LAUGH (or some other series)⚠️  What if there's a list of words that they get and they can only use those words. They can scramble it up however they want but if they say any other word they lose or get some kind of punishment.
I love how pizza place guy and Spencer Agnew are in the same universe
This episode rocks because everybody is in full stride.
im in love with this video
No Damien? No fun
Tommy is such a crazy cutie 😭
Jackie is a disguise to make Courtney seem funnier
I’m saying this is my vibrator just took a different kind of turn
8:08 Noah sounded so different here like some old guy from the titanic actually took over his body 😭✋
6:31 why does he kinda look like Gus Johnson
5:52 please that was one of my favourite moments cause that video was the first smosh video I watched (well remember watching) try not to laugh from smosh truly is iconic
Courtney and Shayne vibe checkers were too powerful
boneless gets me everyfrwaking time
Just an idea for the next one, basically every bit has to add to the previous one, until everyone goes or the person on the seat doesnt laugh. This way after the first bit is done, the next person has to add into it or change it but without the person that started knowing what they are adding. As the person trying not to laugh already laugh at the previous it could get quite caotic and funny
courtney at 10:20 was adorable aaaaahhhh
Do one with warp zone
try not to laugh but you call random numbers and ask them what your act would be like
do a show where they tell you what you will eat and then fastest hand who eats it.if you do best tastes you can add a rule that after the fastest hand you are out soo they have to pick if its the best it can be or not
Courtney is too attractive…
I'd sell what's left of my soul  to get a chance to sit on that stool for a try not to laugh challenge,  I'd laugh my ass off I'm sure. But it would be worth it. Best laugh I'd probably ever have
Omg, the Bop-It skit had me in hysterics!! 😂😂😂
Kids These Days I Payed For This Kids Dinner Yet He Still Tried To Escape My Basement That’s Rude Ain’t It  — Me
Vibe-rater
Uhhh hello im your metal illness
3:07
Damien is so cute xD I love him
JAckie had a moment to start acting like DEXTER from dexters laboratory as an astronaut
I LOVE THE BUNNY LOAN! THANK YOU!
When are we getting a ''chosen one'' feature length movie?
Yikes that first one made me cringe a little
“Oh don’t mind him, he gets his peaches put in Georgia.” Kills me everytime. And then the monkey gets closer to Shayne and there’s audible eating noises.
I swear every time I hear the harmonica I think of the song Piano Man and I cannot help it
The emergency vibe check must make a return
BONELESS!!!!
Off topic but flashback, I’m so uncomfortable after finding out that Shayne pity spit for Macaulay Culkin 😩😩😂😂😂 it’s so awkward lmaooo, that bit lives in my mind rent-free now
THE VIBE CHECK 😂😂😂
How about try not to laugh duos  Every one must come out as part of a team person team attempting to make the hot seat laugh. All teams must be unique
Can we just appreciate how frickin adorable Courtney is though? 10:19
12:36 hilarious, lol
I freaking love Courtney's laugh after her but with Tommy and the monkey. It's so goddamn adorable 🥰🥰
I say that you'll should watch try not to laugh with everybody in the set and the first one that laughs has to do a punishment
Try not to laugh, call back, build off a previous bit only.
Kimmy I feel you, my 2014 Sonic has crank windows and it makes drivethrus real awkward, but also like, the car was cheap, so it's kinda a win? I think?
What about doing an episode where no one can talk, but try to make the person laugh?
I’d love to see a TNTL using only sounds (like the tik tok trend)
Can you guys please do an, "Every Vape Store Ever"?
You guys should do a full episode where each bit was their take on another person's bit from the past. So like a Noah Dumpster Wizard, Shayne as Jones the Record Producer, Tommy as Skimpy Jiggles Jr and Damien as Boneless for instance
😐
I think it would be funny if you invited Michael Reeves with his tasers to try make you guys laugh.
You guys should get Stone Cold Steve Austin on here and see just how stone cold he actually is
I wish Shayne would just do an entire hour of improv
Dang who misses Noah old hair cut
Ok, Tommy's mental illness bit was the best one!
Where’s Olivia, Keith, Noah and Ian
Kimmy saying she's tall (5'7) while i'm sitting here at 5'8 feeling like i'm average height
The Shane bit cinematic universe. I laughed so hard.
Tommy is a comedic genius....
Loved this episode. Kinda nostalgic
vibe-rate is the best thing I've ever heard
PLEASE HAVE MATTHEW LILLARD ON HERE
Kimmy crying because of cute pet skunks is the best thing ive seen
That check up on the loan was awesome I remember that skit and died laughing
The last try not to laugh I remember watching was #10
- " OHH , HALLO SHIINE . It is me your mental illness" killed me
Use water already
When Shayne said Tony’s Pizzeria I knew what was coming 🤣🤣
I swear, anytime Courtney grabs the monkey it is a recipe for hilarity
at 3:40 i love how Jacky slowly turns into Dexter from Dexter's laboratory
You know the "Favorite Pizza Place" Meme is used almost every time, Why do I have a feeling its like a Netflix documentary where the same line of words occurs everytine?
you guys should bring gus back on
Vibe radar XD
istg mommy is so adorable-
9:57 I love how almost every all of Tommy's characters is just an alternate universe version of themselves.
Y’all need to bring Gus back and make him laugh
Bunny went full circle. Literally.
Kimmy is the WAIFU, change my mind
Does anybody know where the uh oh society joke comes from
I'm sorry but Tommy gets me everytime. Even if it doesn't make sense and you can't follow the context he's just hilarious
Idk why I been watching smash for 5 years but I just subbed today lol
what kind of Escape The Night villain was Noah-
13:01 sounds like pennywise laughing
11:40 piano man
“Uh oh, society.” Is my favorite meme now too! Thanks to Kimmy!!!
The “vibe-rater” was a quality pun
I love kimmy so much. She must be protected
Bring back the duels!
Yall should get Bo Burnham on here
The Pissy the clown line (10:20) was excruciatingly funny. One of the biggest burns Shane has done. It's one of those jokes you say when you know you've gone a little to far 😆
DO A COLLAB WITH IMPRACTICAL JOKERS
courtney looks so good in this ep
Jackie has just the most amazingly bizarre characters.
Theme where you can only do iconic bits/characters like favorite pizza place, "has this ever happened to you", and academy of weird sounds, but the catch is everyone except the person who created the bit/character must use it somehow. Or a theme where all you can do is impressions of the person in hot seat?
nickelodeon theme?
please get guests, these are getting sad.
Can we please add Tommy's Mental Illness character to the squad? What a great character
what in Bo Burnham was that Kimmy
you need to get Jack Black on the show :D
Favorite skits from everyone  Tommy:  the mental illness  skits Courtney and Shayne: the vibe check skit Kimmy: Skunk video joke  skit Shayne: the Chosen character trashing the my favorite pizza place guy Jackie: Workout  skit Noah: the little  mermaid skit
Where’s Keith !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Man half these videos and super cringe now ☹️
Courtney looks like such a badass. ✨
1:11, 1:49-2:07, 2:43, 3:03, 5:40, 5:55, 6:32, 7:32, 8:03-8:26, 10:05, 10:41, 11:36, 12:07, 12:42, 13:53, 14:30, 15:24, 17:20
We need another CREW Gauntlet video please. They're so good
I feel bad for ruining this for kimmy but she probably won't see the comment anyway ( those skunks are desacked so they can't spray anymore) it's actually kinda sad it doesn't hurt the animal in any way except mentally
As soon as it’s safe, you should have members of Team Starkid as guests. I feel like they would kick butt at this
Jackie very clearly doesnt understand any jokes or references. I work with a girl like that and she's an idiot. Nothing she does is funny.
Please get rid of Jackie. I'd almost rather have Ian. That speaks volumes.
I love this new hair on courtney!
In the next tntl Shayne should walk up and say these aren't the droids your looking for in the chosen ones voice
Amazing episode! Reason - there is no Olivia in this episode.
This one isnt funny this time I didnt laugh once
Kimmy reacting to the skunk is so genuine and heart melting 😩❤️
Why don’t u guys do spin the bottle anymore
i have an idea instead of harmonicas and this is out there but i was sitting  here with a balloon and it popped what if that was a challenge fill on up and BOOM!! you could make it a mode and give 3 or 5 minutes at a time to make them laugh A.K.A fill the balloon
How many episodes till Best of : Tommy
Shartney vibey was another level lol.
10:17. Courtney’s little laugh is so cute 🥺
Mqn these are fantastic as per usual
Why are all of you so ducking talented?? ❤️❤️❤️
I remember when we had a car with wind down windows
Kimmy killed the game in this! Loved all her bits
Isn’t it amazing how the “Favorite Pizza Place” gag has been going on for three years now?
I love that no matter how bad my day or week is i can always just watch smosh to laugh my ass off
I think I'm in love with Kimmie 😭
The Shayne Cinematic Universe has now been expanded. Everything is connecting,
Good job
Skipper Scotty is my new favorite 😂😂😂
I don’t usually comment, but I’ve seen so so many of these and aside from the hilarious growing skit lore, it’s just so fun to see all of them having a blast while genuinely getting better and better and better at the creativity and improv of it all.  You can tell the whole gang is just such a blast to work with, but they also are feeding off of the laughter and energy from one another. So fun to watch.
So yeah, that loan though?
I didn’t know Trevor Wallace was an ending surprise guest.
I miss Damien
Why Olivia and Courtney ain’t tgt in try not to laugh
My whole life summed up at 12:38 :D
I love that Shayne secretly brought back the bunny mask and loan bit with Courtney. It only took 73 episodes but he brought it back
Bring back the water >:(
only og's will remember the rabbit loan guy omg
Crank windows turn boys into men and girls into..... men
How does Courtney get more attractive 😍😍😍
we live in a society
not gunna lie, this is the kimmy’s best performance. I laughed at everything she said so much, way to go
Guys, please bring back Gus Johnson, I have a great feeling Shayne will pull off the success this time.
I don't under stand the pizza place thing,like I get the reference to the skit I just don't get the skit
This Kimmy girl is hilarious, she should be in more of these!
the harmonicas are the worst addition to this.
Did Courtney accept her proposal?? I NEED TO KNOW
More Vibe Check Shayne and Courtney!
And the winner of this episode iiiiiiis:   Tommy!! 🎉
I can't believe Tommy is Shayne's new Romaence Paertner
I saw the bunny hat and new it was the loan joke!!!!
I LOVE Tommys mental illness character.  "I see you're having a good day, have you thought about NOT having one."  "Over analyze our body. Over analyze our body. Over analyze our body!!"
I love how Tommy broke a plate just for shock factor………..
Can we all appreciate the HUGE comeback of Shane in the Rabbit suit one of his first ever iconic skits
Shane's very presence almost makes Courtney laugh lmao
Why did Jackie sound like Lisa Koshy during Courtney’s turn!?🤣
That Barry Goldberg one got me
I love how every try not to laugh When Tommy comes out he starts out with a character for his bit, and then for half of the video he sticks with that bit, and switches it up
they should do an “inside joke” episode where all the jokes are inside jokes and they can choose to explain them or not.
Yall just get more unfunny people....
day 2 of being sad courtney chopped off all her hair
try not to laugh netfilix adaptation DO IT Lets cfkin do it!!!!
HOW DOES NOAH NEVER BREAK CHARACTER DURING HIS BITS I LOVE HIM LOL
SHAYNES LOAN REFERENCE TO THE FIRTS TNTL IM CRYING 😭💞
Kimmey I need to hear the rest of that song  Hey Arnold was unreasonably hot
Sorry but does anyone know what video had Damien singing as "a person who has heard jack black songs before and is trying to sing like him" and then sings "and the stones are made of BONES and the stone man said as he hangs around,  and the stones are made of BEES"  I just started singing it a few minutes ago, but now I can't find it anywhere:/
Courtney's boneless bit made me wheeze so hard it hurt my lungs hahahaha
You guys are hilarious, my only question is when will you be able to have guests on tntl again?
i want tommy’s character you know the mental illness one to be a reoccurring character
Hi
1.want another vid with gus johnson  2.the water i feel like was funnier
These were all so gooood!
Kimmy's right. Skunks are super cute!
Had me laughing so hard 12:38
Consider: Try Not To Laugh Theatre. Everyone is given a scene to play out together, but it's one persons job to make the others laugh/break character. Do this scene (or different scenes) until everyone's had a turn trying to make the others laugh
courtney gets prettier in every video, i swear
whats wrong with jaq and tom?i smell something to those people over there.
lmao most of us who watched disney knew that space dude impression jackie was trying to do. thats probably how we first ever heard of that guy.
0:25 where the fuck did the chair go 😂😂😂
Is it weird I wanna see a spiderman movie but Peter Parker has the same backstory as The ‘Chosen’ 😂😂 Especially the pizza delivery part
Best TNTL in a while! 🤣
Okay, Tommy broke the game with his mental illness bit. Best one I've seen so far.
5:15 isn't that the scene with the cow from Kung Pow: Enter The Fist?
good viddy
Kimmy should keep the harmonica on till the bit ends. the sounds make the rest of the bit funny too imo
Tommy's Ariel joke was absolutely hilarious
12:26 Billy joel - piano man
Hopefully if we get to smosh try not to laugh 100 we will get everyone who works at smosh in the challenge it could be an ultimate game of try not to laugh maybe like 30 minutes long
Anyone else miss the old Smosh?
God dammit, the harmonica is back...
Noah looks like someone poured melted skittles onto his wet hair as he was drying it so now his hair is stuck like that.
Courtney is so prettyyyyyyyy
I love that the harmonicas are back 😁
3:23 alexa, play desperate cheeto...original version.
oh i guess courtney really is commiting to that eyeliner.. good for u
Where’s olivia?
shane is so fucking funny
Courtney with that monkey puppet clapping into frame at 10:01 took me tf out
30 seconds per skit but kimmy took 40 to make him laugh. How sad.
Can we have a try not to laugh with the jtp?
My favorite part’s when Courtney’s in the chair. When she doesn’t speak.
I hope we see more Mental Illness in future bits
73 episodes later, and he FINALLY came back for his loan!
I can’t believe Shane has a vibe-rater
Way to impersonate and disrespect slavic people
Courtney killed it this episode! I will forever be quoting "Don't mind him, he gets his peaches out in Georgia"
Bring back your bosses Rhett an Link
Peamupbubber
thought it was jslahht
We love her. But someone please... please... tell Courtney about her eyeliner...
what the fuck is this shit
Oh my god Courtney calpestami tutto
Shane bring back Sassy Leg Sergeant.
What happened to this place… it’s fallen off
Honestly this was the funniest TNTL in history 😁
Vibe security could be a good skit for smosh
Omg Shane did not bring the bunny back from the beginning episodes 😂
Olivia's outfit is the best bisexual thing I've seen today.
Have you guys ever done like a dollar store budget run to buy individual new props for TNTL? That'd be a cool challenge
I think about Boneless every fucking day
Clearly sjws have taken the managers job
WHERE ARE THE FLAINTS!!!!😡😡
for the 75th tntl they need to invite as many people as possible who have previously been on tntl I mean EVERYBODY
Somebody please make "it is me. Your mental illness" GIF. Smosh. Please make GIFs for us...
I just dyed my hair and it looks like Shane as a clown now but curlier😭😭😭
6:27 as soon as I saw the tye dye shirt, I knew
Courtney is the weak link
Protect kimmy at all cost
I would really like for Smosh to use water again for their laugh challenges.😢
pls use water again
“Don’t mind him he gets he’s peaches out in Georgia” I laughed so hard
Is it just me or is Noah's voice getting deeper?!?
Mental Illness might be my new favorite character
The good thing about masks is that no one can see me smiling like an idiot when I watch Smosh vids in public
Tommy is welcome to be my mental illness any day of the week 😆
I tried to wacht this in a hostel in a room with 8 other people i just couldt keep my laughter in this shit is too funny 😂😂
damn, courtney's eyeliner today is on point.
Just gonna say, that sweater vest actually looked good on Kimmy. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone actually pull that look off.. but she did!
A Courtney and Shane duo bit is like when Naruto and Sasuke team up
tommy looks like a rendition of alucard in this
I'm loving what Courtney's doing with her eye make up. Looks really cool on her
i'm starting to realize i'm not a fan of noah and jackie
the callbacks. OMG I love it
No Damian? SKIIIIIIP!
I get my peaches out of Georgia...
Vibe-rater 😂
17:20 vibe-rater 😂 also I want the mental illness character to come back, it's so good
Is there going to be smosh summer games?
Tommy as "Mental illness" made me feel so much better about my anxiety/depression🤣💜 Laughter really is the best medicine. Love you guys!
this was agreat ep! Noah's bits always get me
"My Vibe Radar" line was low key fantastic. Also Tommy as The Mental illness is absolutely great
Tommy's mental illness character sounds so much like Brandon Rogers' blind fashion designer character, it's uncanny!
They still making tnls huh
15:22 THE PLATE. 💀💀💀
12:38 I’m fine having rainbow Tommy as my mental illness anyday
Wheres Keith
12:07 Kimmy is so cute 🥺
10:51 the subtitles saying “Shane” tho 💀
10:44 nOmy goD when Noah reALIZED
10:16 😭😭😭 That whole bit and then Courtney being so happy with the mokey at the end was so cuTE 🥺
The mental illness bit is 🔥😂
Do this with gus Johnson again
4:58 Courtney: "yOu cAn'T uSe mY fAvOriTe mEmE agAinSt me!" my brain's first thought: how dare you use my own spells against me, Potter?
I know you’ve probably been asked this 1000 times, but will y’all ever go back to using water??
They've been doing this for 5 years and Shane is still doing his pizza place bit. That's dedication.
Kimmy is nailing It!
the vibe bit blew my brains out
I’m just waiting for one of them to come out someday and absolutely kill it on the keyboard.
Wow Jackie does a good Dexter.
Courtney and Shayne as well as Kimmy and Jacky are great duos :D
3:45 Schwoz from Henry Danger and Danger Force
Tommy is my king.
11:31 kimmy:why was Arnold from he-hey*dies inside because she had the biggest crush on him*,sorry let me start over...why was arnold from hey arnold so hot,LADIES AND GENTS WE NOW HAVE PROOF THAT KIMMY US DATING arnold....from hey arnold?,holy shit
"Yo, my vibrator's picking up zero fricken positive vibes here" That feels like a lot to unpack
17:21 His what now!?
Don't know if my comment would be noticed but I have a little idea. What if in these series of TNTL the person sitting on a chair would be counterattacking the ones who try make them laugh. Like 'the crew' members make jokes, prepare some stuff, present them and in this moment 'the sitting person' has to make the crew laugh using their setup their props their situation and their jokes. Like 'the sitting person' can develop the story of just make something opposite I don't know, something like this. So there's regular 'success' for the crew if the sitting person laughs, but there's 'success' for the sitting person if the crew member laughs
Who else comes to this channel just for tntl
Noah is on a ROLE
12:41 and 15:24 You are welcome
7:11 that was so fucking wrong
Whats the song with the harmonica tho?
oh so that's my mental illness?
kimmy reminding me of that girl in White Chicks when they’re trying clothes on and she’s crying over how fat she is….😂
VIBE RATER
13:02 is that Pennywise?
Äh
So like I get the harmonicas are cause of covid, but like when could we go back to water cause the harmonicas kinda seem to be making it too easy and resulting in lower quality jokes/bits
I don’t know what it is but it’s not the same without Keith and Damien
Noah’s titanic was so under appreciated
I feel like Courtney just finds props, decides to use them, but has no idea how to actually use them
Vibe check is my new favorite skit lol
Dang. I love these guys. One of the few things keeping me going 🤟
I honestly watch these just for Shane
So glad Shayne pulled that classic on Courtney. I’ve been wondering about that loan as well. Been a few years.
Wtf I didnt get this in my recommended/notifications
Shayne's laugh is so cathartic and pure. My heart leaps at the sound.
Ugh, Jackie man. She just makes me cringe
No one picked up on Shaynes “vibe-rator” line 😭Idek if it was on purpose but it killed him
Why did all the funny people leave?
This episode is top tier
Kimmy, you're a gem, never change. 💙
14:35 my mom when we have guests over lol
I'd love if they went back to the no-harmonica style so we can hear them laugh
Peter piper pizza is my FAVORITE 🥰
You beautiful, funny, talented people! Thank you for adding a laugh to an otherwise difficult day 🙏 Many love for your shining faces 🍻
The vibe bros actually need a TV show, it’s been decided
Is it just me or is there a significant lack of cheese on this channel?
Kimmy and Jackie are improving on the skits.
the jester hat matched Noah's hair so well, i loved it.
im sorry but that clown bit. fucking comedic gold. came out real strong. bring back smosh and order cause that needs to be a case.
Jackie gets so many sympathy laughs for being cringe it’s so hard to watch
Barbra manatee…
Is anyone wondering what happened to olivia
Is it my birthday? Cause cake
The Vibe Police and the Human Embodiment of Mental Illness need to be reoccurring bits.
I SWEAR DID WE ALL HAD A CRUSH ON ARNOLD?????
I found these videos are a lot better if you skip passed Jackie's turns. She's painful to watch.
It’s great to see you guys back on YouTube especially Courtney Miller and Kimmy Hernandez I wish you guys would come to the UK so I had to have a chance to meet all of you especially used to and of course you to Shane topp
This episode is SO absurdist. It's awesome.
2:36 Cyberpunk 2077 clothing options be like
Honestly, I'm struggling so much with my mental health rn. It's rare I smile or laugh, but thank you for helping me smile n laugh a little. ❤
Who actually finds this funny and entertaining?
It’s too bad Damien wasn’t in this. Quality dropped because of that
I want boneless and dumpster wizard to go up against Brianna boho and The Chosen in a game of Password
How does Tommy always come up with the BEST characters? I need full skits now with My Mental Illness
Incorporating the ventriloquist and dog show joke with a monkey as the puppet was amazing and genius
Kimmy is so beautiful ❤️❤️
I love Kimmy for just being Kimmy. If you need someone to say your great call me and I'll say I love you for being you, Don't change birch.
Jackie sounds a lot like Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory.
Not watching until it’s back to water
My vibe…orator 😅
UH OH *society*
Love Courtney’s outfit!
There’s so much “favorite pizza place” lore!
Shayne sounded like South Park's portrayal of Al Gore lol
Tommy’s mental illness skit should be an official character. He can act on situations torwards each characters/you actors. Yes you actors.
PISSY THE CLOWN XD 10:40
I like how Shayne low key making fun of Noah's hair😂
By far the best try not to laugh 🤣
Shayne is the only reason I still watch these anymore
Bring back Gus Johnson PLEASE
Courtney and Shayne's vibe check bros bit is peak bisexual energy
okay but courtney looks so good :,)
Dammit, the harmonica is back😢 that makes me a sad panda
omg Kimmy is so funny, i loved every bit of hers
This video just confirmed that I love Kimmy. 😁
Anyone else crushing on Kimmy?
I have crank car windows too!
I’m very proud of my cars crank windows
Wait I saw myself
I'm a man and also autistic... could someone please explain Courtneys eye makeup, I don't understand.
11:19 WHAT IS THAT GREEN THING MOVING ON THE FLOOR
VibeRator really got me ffs 😭
Courtney and Shane need to run around college campuses as the vibe police candid camera style
If Boneless isn't an NPC in the next Fallout, I'm not buying.
Tommy's continuous themed bits are the best Edit: Courtney really got in on the dog show one tho
Tommy's continuous themed bits are the best
Shane spends about an hour making 400 phone calls to a given pizza place (and that’s the minimum)😂
Gota love Courtney's Bieb bits (: lmao
@1:40 why does Shayne look like Stevewilldoit plus that nerdy guy from this channel?
ngl the he get's his peaches out in Georgia is my favourite joke now.
Rewatched all episodes in the span of 3 days. Got to say, I had to skip every Olivia bit. Kimmy and tommy are amazing at this!
Vibe police was the bestttt hahahahaaha
I feel like i need a safeword for this episode XD
Tommy doing the its me your mental illness was just killer
If it’s modern smosh then it’s pretty easy not to laugh
YESSS KIMMY!! Get it girl!!
What happened to Keith
Kimmy was on fire this ep!!!
im laughing like its not the fourth time ive seen this
I have no idea if "vibe rater" was intentional or not, but it is glorious.
12:50 does Tommy remind anyone of the He Man meme?
shayne has continued the spirit of sarah by being the ultimate hype man and laughing in the background, love that
We need an ultimate TNTL with eeeeeeeeeverybody. Imagine having Shayne, Court, Olivia, Damien, Ian, Keith, Noah, Jackie, Kimmy AND Tommy? That’s like 20-30 minutes of nonstop laughter
holy voice change noah 🔥
when shayne pulled out the "look at me.... I think legally you have to look at me" again i died lmaooo😂
Should do a Blindfolded/Audio-Only try not to laugh.
Can there be a dumpster wizard meets boneless skit? That would be hilarious
Where is Keith?!?!
courtney asking about nuclear rain again is golden
this was more funny back in the days
The vibe is good!
VIBE CHECK!! YOooOOoOo
Why do I feel like if Damien was here he would’ve read more non copyright poetry
Kimmy asking the important questions: Why was Arnold fromHey Arnold so hot?
More.
Anyone who doesn’t see Courtney and Shayne as deranged siblings is wrong. I don’t care.
Tommy, Damian, and Shayne need to battle for another Hard Mode.
Ayy this is an emergency vibe check 😎🤝 make sure you're vibin' homies, have a great day .
Wow this is embarrassing
I can't remember if it's been done already, but they should do a knockoff version, where they just copy the last person's skit, but maybe with different props each time. Same joke/punchline, but they can't use the same props lol
I know I keep saying it, but GODDAMN, TOMMY IS A NATIONAL TREASURE
shayne’s goldberg bit got me fjshgjejvgjwjf
That vibe check service needs to be a real thing. I would give them all my money no questions asked
The “Vibe Radar” is the best joke
New girl ain’t funny😖
Courtney with the peaches and the monkey is so adorable!!♡
Wow
No Damien no funny
I live for Shayne's favorite pizza place bit.♡  Also Courtney's justin beiber bit was so cute.♡♡
Pet skunks stomp because that’s a normal thing they do in the wild and get their spray sack removed
I live for the episodes where Shayne adds to the Pizza Place Multiverse
WHERE IS KEITH?
I don’t know why but I love that monkey puppet!!!!
I feel like I want to see Noah’s titanic character just show up again in a bunch of different tragedies in history 😂
dude courtney's eyeliner looked amazing
24 on trending
Only if my mental illness looked that fabulous
3:30 i expected her to just randomly say "DEDE GET OUT OF MY LABORATORY"
Look I know she's gay (or is it bi? I may be wrong) but JESUS I WANT TO JUST TAKE COURTNEY AND   ... burp it out like bros. Gotcha hahaaa. (I'm not crying,  you are
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
Tommy is my new sleep paralysis demon
We need moreee
Putting notches on my wall for the days before we go back to water
Between Courtney’s graphic liner and Noah’s fire hair, the looks are so on point this episode! I freakin love this cast rotation
Actually grew up watching smosh since I was 8 years old. Turning 21 now
13:06 ITS BONLESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
best part 12:40
Noiceee
That was the worst Matt Bradley impression by Shayne 😭🤣
Wth shayne really brought back that character from like the beginning of tntl
HI I LITERALLY REACT THE SAME AS KIMMY WHEN I SEE SOMETHING CUTE  I LITERALLY CRIED WHEN I FIRST SAW MY DOG, THOR, AS A PUPPY HE WAS SO ADORABLE I— sorry, please continue your scrolling
IMHO, Tommy is the best theres ever been on TNTL, I love him so much
Bye Kimmy
CAN WE PLEASE GET A SMOSH SKETCH OF THE VIBE POLICE?!?!?!?!?!
Do Kallmekris next as a guess pls
OMG I'M SO GLAD BONELESS SHOWED UP!!!!
Courtney representing with the Doc Martins hell yeah
This content is fucking stank....
LOVE THE MONKEY BRING IT BACK ON FUTURE EPISODES hehe
off topic, but i love Courtney's vest.
Fun fact: In one day, the average individual’s heart exerts enough power to lift a 1-ton weight more than 40 feet off the ground.
Honestly, the "Viberator" bit was so funny, shayne has to make that his new character
I didn't know that Remus Sanders made a cameo in this. A lot more colourful than he usually is though.
Tommy: *sneaks up and snaps a plate* Kimmy: *laughs in terror*
Kimmy’s eyes are gorgeous though.
5:54 People when covid finally ends
13:53 missed the opportunity to say "what goes around comes around".
Praise the monkey puppet
Shayne’s evolving character universe, Tommy’s Your Mental Illness, and Shartney’s Vibe Auditors are all now live in my brain, rent free.
I dont know why, but I dont really like Jackie -_-
you can tell noah has so much respect for shayne it's so cute to see
WE NEED MORE OF THE VIBE POLICE!!!
10:28 okay time to rewatch all of Smosh and Order
the play on the word vibrator as VIBE RATER as in rating vibes is ABSOLUTE FUCKING GOLD  that shit NEEDS to be on a t-shirt "THE VIBERATER"
Thanks to all of you @Smosh for bringing me to tears laughing several times and for making one day of this year finally, actually, feel like a day of Summer.
A++ love this content! Can you guys manage two tntl a week?? im always hangin out for these videos i could watch an hour of this!
Tommy does 'chains' which make him probably the most interesting to watch (alongside the wild Shayne ones).
this is one of the bests tntlc episodes so far
shanes bunny bank loan finally made a come back!!!! also tommy was on fire for this one!!!
Courtney and her peaches made me LOL 😂😂😂😂
I saw sunglasses, a telephone, and crossed arms, and immediately knew what was going to happen
I feel like Courtney should learn Tuvan Throat Singing/throat bass (if you’re a beatboxer) or some other crazy vocal techniques like inward bass/evil bass. That’d be some unique addition to her boneless bits
YASSSS HE FOLLOWED UP ON THE LOANNNNNN
After this episode I'm thinking they recently heard of the Australian show 'Farmer Wants A Wife' 🤣😂
Courtney x Shane - I vibe that bit.
The black girl didn’t make me laugh once. She just tried wayyyy too hard in my opinion.😑😑😑
Shayne looks like PC principal from South Park
Noah’s plunger joke and adrift jester were so frigging dumb is what I said after I stopped  laugh crying.
It's sad that we stopped asking for the SHUT UP back
Tommy is amazing 😂😂😂😂
I feel like this is probably one of my favourite tntl groups I love these people
“Why didn’t you play the piano” lol y’all were extra ridiculous this show lol
I love Jackie's dairy Queen bit
Saige in Try not to laugh - anyone?
This was SO good
can you guys just not add anyone or have anyone leave the cast and dont change at all for at least 10 more years? tntl is PERFECT. Dont fuck up something this magical to watch, every episode is fire, one of the last places i genuinely cry laughing ever episode and one that i actually REWATCH because its so good. Never change baby, well, guests and even adding cast might be cool, maybe more props, but yea, its perfect.
Can someone please explain Tommy’s Ariel bit to me?
They were really on their A game this video lmao
That Judge Tommy bit is golden.
Glad to see Boneless again
I’m surprised Shane knows what Peter piper pizza I thought it was a Texas pizza place
Conspiracy theory: Shayne wasn’t laughing he was genuinely mad that Jackie didn’t play the piano 🎹
I live for tntl
What happened to the water?
What's Tommy's Ariel bit about?
THE BOP IT JOKE IS INSTANTLY IN THE TNTL HALL OF FAME
Tommy's mental illness bit is my new favorite bit on try not to laugh.
You should invite kallmekris to do an episode
I love when they have Jackie on cause I know that whatever she pulls, funny or not, it will be the biggest and the wildest choices possible.
For someone who has a mental illness, that is very funny! :)
Tommy rolling in in a rainbow suit like "I'm your mental illness" is exactly what the pendulum swing feels like when youre manically up in a bipolar swing. It's nuts how accurate a depiction that was  He's making a dumb joke, and I'm out here having epiphanies 🙄
Real fans remember the bunny that applied for a loan😂
Shane with the cuffed jeans and converse
Kimmy lost her marbles and I love it
Write S in the chat if you love skungks
Nooo, the harmonicas are back!
Kimmie is so pretty. Good for her
I see Boneless...... I like.
Tommy with his continuation of jokes just always kills me 🤣
Continuity error. Stool is there at 0:27 and then disappears a few seconds later.
Love Tommy's "Hi I'm your mental illness! 🤣" Tommy please keep doing that character
H e l l o🌈  I t   i s   M E ,  y o u r  ✨m e n t a l   i l l n e s s✨
No one cares get off the internet
where did the stool go at 0:31 😭
Okay here's a serious question for Tommy; how do you do your hair my guy? My hair is very similar to yours from what I can see. But yours always looks perfectly on point. So I got to know, what do you do to keep it like that?
The mental illness gets me everytime
I love how shayne brought back the „Hi i‘d like to apply for a loan“ from episode one or two😂😂😂
Can anyone tell me what happened to keth?? Was wondering
kimmy crying over cute things is the most adorable thing ever omg. i love her even more lol
8:00 I’ve seen this skit somewhere but idk where
Shane bringing back a CLASSIC
12:37
Is no one going to mention Shayne's joke from 4 years ago (TNTL #2)?? "Hi I'd like to apply for a loan" 😂😂😂
The plunger brain was funny
kimmy crying over skunks 😭 lemme join you 💗
Tommy always slays in these 🔥🔥🔥
Yes any TNTL without Olivia is a great TNTL
*Hey, to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Tommys mental illness character is such a Damian character and i love it. Speaking of i so want him to use it on Damian XD
😆 Kimmy is so adorable!!
Kimmy is a treasure :D
Im a crazy or is this the first time Kimmy has been in a Try Not to Laugh? Cause she killed it 😂
5:11 you can’t tell me Noah doesn’t look like Tobey Maguire at this angle
SHANE MAKING A JOKE OUT OF HIS LIFE WITH HIS TWO JOBS IS JUST SO FUNNY TO ME!??!?
Tommy was TOO. DAMN. EXTRA. And im here for it
I wish my mental illness was like Tomey's Character 😂😂😂
12:52 "..but have you considered NOT having one?" Just realised that could mean not having a day at all and not just not having a good day, making it 100x more dark
6:23 oh my gosh the Goldbergsss 😂😂😂
Ya'll need to get callmekris on the show
"my vibe-rator" jesus christ lmao
BONELESS IS BACKKK!!!!
The stool used instant transmission
Tommy And Shane Kill Me! We Need A Shirt with tommy On it with that outfit that says If my Mental Illness Were Human! <3 LMAO i looove it!!!
I have an idea for a tntl episode   It’s called “the play” and how you play is one person is in the hot seat and one person goes out to tr and make them laugh, then when there bit is over one other person comes out and has another bit but the other person from before has to join the bit and until everyone comes out from the backstage, it’ll be one big skit to make they person in the hot seat laugh  You can use props and you can dress up, but I think it’ll be a good idea  Like so they can see!
Bring back the water, the harmonicas aren't as good.
Why did they bleep out shit but not god damn
we need more Noah + Jackie content for sure !!
Every time I hear Courtney's Boneless voice I get so intensely excited
Oh shit I got the same green harmonica dame
this is quite literally my ideal combination of people for TNTL!!!! i love it.
how far this channel has fallen...
Tommy wearing Sarah's crazy ass onesie is making me tear up.
BEST ONE YET 👍👍👍👍 loved the call back to “uh legally…I think you have to look at me”
Did no one else notice that the stool just disappeared at the beginning before shayne says let’s go????
Tommy's new character is literally just chaos as a human
0:30 Is nobody going to talk about how the hot seat just disappeared
I love boneless. She/He is my favorite Smosh character. I love the whole bit. It is great.
*Most Mental Illnesses* “I see you’re having a good day so far!- but have you considered not having one? :D”
Kimmy must cry every time she looks in a mirror.      Cause she’s cute.
I want a smosh mainchannel video with a courtney n shayne vibe police full length sketch
I haven't watched you guys in years... You've grown so much..
"have you ever opened your mouth in nuclear rain and it tasted like cinnamon?"
Day 1 of annoying our lord and saviours over at Smosh into bringing back Smosh Pit Weekly :)
Accidentally clicked on this while trying to fix it to not recommend channel. Wish I could take this view back
Emergency Vibe Police is golden lmaooooo
Can we get Character Speed Dating? Everyone plays a selection of their characters and just quick interactions between all of them. Could have some interesting conversations.
How did he change so fast?
Shayne with a 4 year old joke was good
God, Jackie is so fucking unfunny
Courtney was so good in this one
Miss Sarah's laugh in the background. ♥
“Yo my vibe-rater is picking up zero freaking positive vibes here” fucking dead 💀
Tommy is just a comedic genius
Guess the editors gave up on censoring all of the bad words and I’m so happy for it 😭
So I've only seen a couple of these but the harmonicas are awkward to me. Whats wrong with just hearing them laugh?
17:11
I think I'm getting old..or just a miserably old man I don't enjoy Smosh as much as I use to  and it's definetely not the staff or anything, Kimi, Jackie and Tommy are GREAT additions and i love them..i just find myself watching less and less lately :(
Kimmy continues to not be funny
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Noah’s titanic joke had me rolling wtf😂😭
Shayne looks like Matt Bradley from the Goldbergs😂
“Mental Illness” is my new favorite character!😂🤣🤣😂
You need to get Ryan Reynolds on the show
I just love tommy.
You guys/gals literally put a smile on my face every time I watch you! 😁 Ps. Good Vibe checks lolz ☑
Noooo where is Damien?
This is one of the better episodes in a while
Y’all were on FIRE ❤️❤️ this is the best TNTL in a while.
The fact that Kimmy cries at cute things is both so adorable and such a mood
Vibe check!!!
Ima be honest i dont like the girl with fuzzy hair
Kimmy’s opener was great.
Tommy's Mental Illness character is next-level material. 🤣 Please keep doing it.
Yall should show kimmy the video about rats taking care of kittens also rats try not to hurt there owners to so they lick instead of bite
TOMMY 😂❤️
this series literally gives me another reason to live every time a new episode comes out
My god, the Vibe Cops are THE sound of Summer 2021
It’s fitting that Shane’s character during the vibe check bit was so similar to Owen Wilson because my first thought was the TVA from Loki.
Legit thought Tommy was dressing as a Final Fantasy villain.. 🤣🤣🤣
Tommy is literally my favorite
Please bring Anthony back for one episode, if possible, to do a dixon cider reunion 😂
So did Jackie give Noah a Moo-kake?
You guys need to do a video called Every Peloton Ever or something like that.
How the hell do people find this funny? The average age watching this has to be 5. Cringe as hell.
vibe check squad incredible
Lmao Noah!
bro the Loan Bunny made a comeback i did not expect that
Hey, crank windows are awesome.
Also love how closer you guys have gotten you can tell when you cant hold in that laugh haha
I love the series, Shayne is amazing and kimmy is so cute lol
Shayne’s “Legally you have to look at me” callback was awesome
Bro the bunny character Shayne did was a character he did in the first try not to laugh!
This video was such a vibe tho like really I was vibin bro. haha ily guys pls Dont stop this series ever pls and thank you or the vibes are WHACK
Okay after the last few episodes I really really need a full like 2 hour roast where the cast just roast each other for the whole thing. It would be amazing. Shane's bit to Noah wasn't even mean, that shit was hilarious.
Honestly kinda expected when Shayne "went to the bathroom" someone was just gonna keep saying pull it
I feel like I haven’t seen Jackie in forever! Good to have her back!
Spencer the chosen will always be his funniest schtick to me
Kimmy is so dang pretty though
i love the evolution of courtney’s outfits it’s changed so much and it’s amazing
Awesome Video. I bet some moron is going to feel offended about the mental illness joke, just making a bet.
"you're gonna like the way you subscribe, i guarantee it" i laughed harder than i should've
The fact that The Chosen and Favourite Pizza Place Guy exist in not only the same universe but the same area code is information I never knew I wanted to know.
This was honestly the worst episode yet imo.
Kimmy so cute 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
I have a theory that Noah doesn't find any of the cast members funny anymore lol. Maybe he did at one point, but those laughs are now just fake lol
that vibe bit killed me hahaha
Why is Kimmy so damn cute
the "vibe rator" killed meee
Bro, when I tell you Shayne is my favorite 🙌🏼 guy said palaton in the background 🤣🤣
Where’s Damien?!?!?
Damn I wish my mental illness monster looked like Tommy
Courtney's entrance noises for 'Boneless' during Shane's turn sounded just like Pennywise's laugh from the newer It movies. SOMEONE FIGHT ME ON THIS
jackie sounds like gru from despicable me LMAOO
They should get the creators of Rick and Morty on this
And here i was, thinking kimmy couldn't get more adorable
Shane's bit makes it come full circle, i love it.
They’re should be a match where everyone has to use a musical instrument!
This was the best fever dream ive ever had
Shayne's world building is impeccable
Need more sketches with the vibe police showing up at inappropriate place ex.. funerals, job mettings, cancer treatment centers etc
I think I like them better without the harmonica, when they brake it seems less forced and more genuine.
The return of boneless. My favorite character
Jackie is really milking that cow costume
Tommy's mental illness character is really good
Kimmo fucking killed it this episode lol
I've enjoyed all the try not to laugh videos but this is like my new favorite. I was cry laughing from start to finish
Lame as Hell.
The harmonicas add a lot.
Tommy is the master of storyline bits
Love these videos! They are so amazing. Stay safe everyone 💕💕
laughed
I love Tommy's new character, and I hope "Mental Illness" comes back again
When she was doing burpees then said high knees I had flashbacks to the sand pit on Parris Island
Top three:   Shayne bringing back the " legally look at me" bunny man.   " your mental illness" by Tommy  Jackie singing but forgetting to play the piano throughout the bit.
Shayne was hellbent on throwbacks in this one... and I love it!
Please do a dedicated video on the T.V.A. "The Vibe Authorities"
Happy to see Tommy again
MORE KIMMY!!!
Love these. Wish they were every Tuesday
Is it just me or is this the best tntl in recent memory. It just felt like there were no bad bits and everyone was hitting on their jokes
Kimmy is cute asf
Where tf did the chair go in the intro
This SLAPPPPPSSS SO HARD. OFF THE CHARTSSSSSSS
I think this is the first time Courtney and Shayne have done a bit together
Courtney’s impression of Justin Bieber if he was a record business guy dude was immaculate. Also I love Shayne’s but for Courtney yes
Shayne with the classics and throwbacks
Tommy's mental illness bit has gotta be one of the best in smosh tntl history
I need a vibe police sketch in my life
smosh put looks like theyre cosplaying the burger king kids club all theyre missing is someone in a wheelchair
I thought they stopped
I really like everybody’s outfits in this one.
how have they done almost 75 of these and they still manage to come up with funny bits every time
Jackie is the best, always impresses me
Courtney's dog show callback was hands down the best joke in the video. Should've gotten a laugh
#25 on trending rn lets gooo :))) what did it peak at ?
Yo why is courtney so bad
“But seriously… what about that loan?”
The  far-flung menu finally chase because copper collaterally wait plus a slow bail. smiling, exotic recess
I love all of Smosh so much!
Kimmy is so gosh darn adorable, she is a freakin national treasure, and she must be protected from the evils of this world. She is too pure for us
So spencer agnew and pizza place shayne are in the same universe huh...welcome to the shayne topp cinematic universe
I wonder how many of them can actually play that piano
I miss aunt caroline
I love tommy so much
Everytime I see one of these videos Courtney get so pretty every time
It's still funny but why you guys stopped the water in your mouth tradition? It's way more funnier.
SC peaches are better anyways
Noah was really channeling a party city commercial in that first one 😂
Throwback to when Keith got flashed by courtney and olivia
The harmonicas are annoying, the water is so much funnier.
How I look most days around people 7:28
jackie's many accents:  3:28 russian 3:35 french?? 3:40 gru 3:50 southern gal 3:57 just... jackie..? 4:00 ipad kid
Jackie's bit is even funnier after the most recent Rick and Morty episode 😭🤣
0:31 where the hell the stool go
Kimmy killed it today
This was one of the best episodes
I love Jackie so much I-
My favorite part was Noah's Bella la Ball cosplay. XD
waiting for rainbow mental illness shirts
2:57 Courtney looks like a character out of a BL anime 😭
Can we get a petition going or something to get Bo Burnham on here?
0:13 I love yall but looks like i just walked into gsa 😂
please more bits with the Vibe Security!!!
You could have a whole show with Tommies mental illness character.
Courtney is definitely a doomer.
8:00 Please someone edit this part and put him in the ocean with the titanic XD so underated
Courtney makes me feel things.
I don’t know what that plate was made of at 15:26, but the fact that Tommy was able to break it in half confirms that he’s a god.
Where the hell is Damien? We want Damien
Jimmy gives off Olivia vibes in this
This is the funniest episode I've seen in a while haha. Everyone was so on point
I missed Boneless. That's my favorite bit.
Kimmy really stepped up into the big leagues
That mental illness joke tho. Five stars, will laugh again
TNTL YESSSS
Can we get Jus Gohnson on more episodes
Yahhh
Vibe rater had me in tears idk why💀
Tommy needs to keep my mental illness to himself 😂
Omg Tommy. I f$%cking love him.
Bro the bunny bank loan is a huge call back!!!!
COURTNEYYY ugh they look so fucking stunninggggg
I love my hand crank windows. Specifically the part where I don't have to pay so much for the widow switch
As soon as Kimmy said "oh! oh! society" I needed to recover my sanity.
The Vibe Police and Mental Illness sent me 😂😂😂
I’m always excited when I see the new TNTL!
The Tommy and Courtney ongoing dog show bit just SLAYED me
I LOVE Bonelesss
please stop putting jackie on shes not that good at improv…
*vibe rater*
keep it up pelatooon
"Oh! Oh! Oh, unpasteurized! Oh, oh! I'm gettin' tonsilitis!" -Noah Grossman 2021
1:11 Kimmy’s hilarious and stunning as always♥️
Kimmy is the best looking woman on this channel
I have a crush on Kimmy.
I wonder if people actually call up their fave pizza place just to say "You're my favorite pizza place" and hang up 🤣
Is it me or does Jackie do a perfect impression of Jester from Critical Role in her first joke?
I need more emergency vibe checks!!!!!!!!!!
MORE!!!!!!
I feel like Kimmy was the funniest she’s ever been in this video she crushed it 😂😂
This was one of the best TNTL. Everyone was hilarious!!
If there's a doomsday scenario where Earth is screwed and only one spaceship is going out into the universe to colonize a new planet, Kimmy better be on that spaceship
Tommy as the "Mental Illness" is my new favorite bit.
Tommy is just such a fucking legend
Jackie is the goddess of receiving pity laughs
Bring the emergency vibe checkers back.
Jackie's Russian Astronaut sounded a lot like Dexter from Dexter's Laboratory
omg Kimmy is so precious. Need to see way more of her and Jackie
When Kimmy got emotional with the skunk video, I started getting emotional too. It was just so adorable
That vibe rater joke was on point! That has to be the best pun I've heard in months. OMG. I wish Olivia was there for that. No doubt she would have died laughing.
7:11 there was a epstein joke somewhere in there
Courtney be 🔥 killing it 👏
5:54 WOW WHAT A CALLBACK
The reason why they laugh is because they are friends. Slap me on that show, I might smile, but I bet they couldn’t make me laugh.   This videos are easy for me to get through without laughing. But I’ll smile due to their friendships.
the metal illness bits where the best i lmfao
Shayne im your big fan from the philippines❤️🥰😍
kimmy at 12:08 is the purest thing
Was Noah having trouble pulling out? Or did he not quite measure up?
Idk how but I fucking knew where Courtney was going with that first bit 😂🤣 lost my shit even harder because I was right
Man, kim is my soulmate lol. I love the energy she gives off.
Tommy’s mental illness bit is an instant-classic
Courtney actually looked closer to Hailey Bieber during her impression! The oversized men’s blazer and all lol!
this has to be the most out of pocket episode of the whole series lol
The dog show but with courtney was so fucking funny to be. Tommy rounded the corner and aloud I was like NOPE
Yaaaaay
11:05 - well that's going in the next "Smosh Dark Humor" compilation.
I would without a doubt watch a whole sketch about the Vibe Police.
I want another gauntlet try not to laugh!
Trending!!!!!
God have mercy! The harmonicas are back!
Boneless is back! 😂😂
Some good characters being born in this one 😎
Kimmy was extra hilarious this time... love ya Kimmy
Courtney's banshee scream laugh is always amazing.
Okay, Trafalgar Law, I'm ready for the War
Tommy nd Courtney dog show skit was 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
Courtney and Kimmy are the most adorable human beings ever I swear
Tommy is a GENIUS LOL
Boneless is one of my favourite characters from the TNTL
I love seeing how far the cast has come from the first few tntl. I love Courtney's transformation the most you got to watch her really find her voice in comedy and its cool to see the progression over the years.
You can do eat it or eat it but with a really really really good food and then if the if they don’t spit it out and if they get a point
I really want to see dumpster wizard again. It's been so long since he's been in a video.
The reoccurring jokes where the cast members build and modify them over the course of the episode (like the pet show this episode) or episodes (like my favorite pizza place) always kill me. Even if I don't laugh initially, I WILL laugh eventually.
I really hope we get to see saige in a try not to laugh!
nice
Also where tf is damien
What harry potter house is Courtney’s vest
Shayne just dove into the recycling bin for this TNTL, and i love it.
Lovin all the call backs lol 😆 😎🤟
Kimmy not letting Jackie walk off without a hug was adorable.
I want gus back 😁
Anthony Needs to do a video titled "I sat down with the cast of smosh"
i love pp
Keith has spiritually taken over Jackie to participate in this
Tommy’s mental health skit is THE best ever skit
Boneless!
I would give anything to have the monkey puppet in my possession. <3
OMG THAT GOLDBERGS BIT had me absolutely rolling
Bunny Shayne!!!
I’m Kimmy when she talks about the skunk stomps 😌💯🤣
I hope you eventually bring the water back! It was way funnier to watch than the harmonicas!
the bunny loan bit lol that hasnt been around in so long!!!
Courtney and Jackie are the least funniest. Had to put that out there.
Everything Kimmy said about herself in that song I lowkey find attractive in women...  Also I'm excited that more of shaynes characters are crossing over. I hope they build up to an avengers-style video, featuring all of our favorite SCU (Shayne Cinematic Universe) characters!
I’m still waiting for saige to be in this
13:04 why have I never been so excited for boneless Joe 😂😂
Tommy mental illness character is the my favorite character since Shane's crazy hobo wizard
Y'all should go on Hot Ones and then play this with Sean Evans
Water spitting needs to come back
I will never get tired of Shayne's recurring bits.
Kimmy is FUNNY.
Tommy just doesn’t miss
Can we get Gus Johnson back again??
The moment I saw Shayne with the pink eye mask and the rabbit head cover I knew exactly what he was going to say!! For people who are wondering that was one of Shayne's joke to Courtney from the first episodes of try not to laugh!
Vibe secured.
people say I'm tall but the truth is taller ... damn kimmy
Some day. Someday they’ll bring the water back
Do you think you would ever bring the water back?
lol Courtney's muffled "NO" during Tommy's bit. xD
This one was the best in a while
11:30 this new Olivia Rodrigo song is so weird. Bops, but in a weird way.  Still one of her best. 👏👏
Anyone have the link to the skunk video?
I wish my mental illnesses were as fabulous as Tommy 😂
I wish I loved anything like Kimmy loves cute things...
With the harmonica, get Gus Johnson back on. Mouth control can't save him now
no but imagine a blindfolded try not to laugh
every bit in this was so funny, this is honestly my new favorite tntl video yet
Tommy wins the internet today.
5:57 wow 4 years and he still doesn't have his loan
“Halloou ighm youreh manteul illnaahs” that killed me instantly lol
Oh Noah, when will his quest for the most ridiculous hairstyle ever end ?
Can you please switch back to water the harmonica isn’t funny it’s annoying
Tommy wins
What is the skunk video though?
I just wanna say I love these this is definitely the best content y’all make
Tommy you psychopath lol
Sad to admit, Uranus got me...
12:07 I didn't think Kimmy could make me crush harder on her. But her finding things so adorable that she cries is honestly so adorable!
I like the alternate universe shayne lore is that his entire day is just constantly calling pizza places. 24/7
17:18 Anyone else can’t get past Shayne looking like the police dog from Paw Patrol?
Tommy is such a mood, I need more mental Illness sketches 😅
Mmmm, they Goldbergs bit that Shayne did was 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻
Does Noah secretly (not so secretly) go to raves??
Kimmy’s song was 🔥
This one was soo funny, keep it up!
Would love to see the Vibe Police in a sketch!!
Ooo some deep cut shanye jokes
I understood 'Semen' instead of 'Sea Men', is that weird?
Vibe check!!!!
Between 0:25 and 0:30 the stool disappeared 0-0
Please I hope Tommy keeps his mental illness character for more bits Bruh imagine:"Every Mental Illness ever"💀💀
only *VIBE-RATOR* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tommy does the same joke over and over and I still laugh each time he is so funny
Damien instead of kimmy she’s not very good
I'm glad we're getting additions to the SCU (Shayne Cinematic Universe).
I think everyone deserves a Boneless movie
Vibe Rater // Vibrator  Genius!!
Tommy turned into a final fantasy villain and looked great!
Me as soon as I see Shayne come out in the sunglasses: Goddammit
I laughed so hard at this episode I’m literally crying
I love it when they keep the storyline/ skit canon going into multiple parts and attempts, we have a winner!
glad we finally got a Matt Bradley appearance on smosh lol
is it just me that doesnt find jacklyn funny?
eh i miss old smosh with humor
Kimmy really made a whole song to say “there’s nothing sexy about me” and Tommy came back with the “that’s the mental illness sis.” 10/10
Why is Tonmy as mental illness a German? 😂😂
The im your mental illness bits are my new favorite thing. Genius
Tommy is a frickin' genius
Kimmy killing it!! 😂
Tommy’s this is your mental Illness character is hilarious
Kimmy was on fire in this episode 😂
Tommy’s this is your mental Illness character is hilarious
Honestly, Tommy's first three bits told an entire story that was creepy and I'm kind of cool with it.
Kimmy, your eyes fill me with SUCH JOY
I can’t wait for the day when there won’t be anymore harmonicas
I want too see gus Johnson again please!
Where’s olivia
i love how shane turns tomato red before laughting at a joke
That Seamen song is probably the hardest I've ever laughed at one of Jackie's bits
lol Kimmy is great XD
2:40 looks just luke rave kids frim the 90s
i wish my mental illness was this colorful
This is my comfort series
”The Vibe-rater” was the best pun
Anybody else think that Jackies first bit sounded like Gru from Despicable Me Anyone...
12:38, 6:41, 5:32 my replay buttons
Kimmy brought it this episode!!
How do I get Kimmys song as ringtone? Asking for a friend...
My ding a ling! My ding a ling! I want you play with my ding a ling!
5:58 DUDE IM SO HAPPY HE DID THAT CAUSE I LITERALLY THINK ABOUT THE ORIGINAL BIT, I SHIT YOU NOT,  E V E R Y   F U C K I N G   D A Y 9:00  Okay, but this dress is literally so gorgeous. Like if it were made to be worn as clothes and not a costume, I’d wear the shit outta it
Imagine how powerful it’d be to have a tntl with shayne, kimmy, jackie, noah, tommy and damien.
I NEED THAT SWEATER VEST HOLY SHIT PLZ HELP ME FIND IT
Courtney is slowly turning into an alt girl
Tommy was the best this episode.
I need to see the mental illness character more 😍😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣🤣
If anyone hurts Kimmy I will kill them. No questions, they will simply be deleted from existence
You all really brought it and I’m so happy to be here for it!! 💙💜🤍🖤
Natural no make-up Kimmy > any other Kimmy
Wow when he said kings cup at the end, gave me all kinds of old school vibes!
Why has Smosh become this
17:10 the start of a journey...
Good laugh
Im playing along too! But instead of a harmonica in my mouth I have a mixture of Baja Blast and Skinny Pop popcorn.
Did Kimmy actually just cry for a bit? Holy shit I died
Now this is a great cast now we just need keith and Damien everything will be perfect no Olivia because she isn't funny
Jackie's bit when she was trying to make tommy laugh sent me
can someone explain the "barry goldberg" joke please lol
"I'd like to apply for a loan" is My favorite shayne skit itsgreat to see it comeback after so many years
Where's Damien?? :(
This one was weak.
Everyone was great but I’m giving tommy 1000 points for the professional dog show judge
Could you guys please invite Seth Everman on to do a try not to laugh? I must see the bald keyboard man do funnies.
anytime boneless makes an appearance it's immediately my favorite episode 😂😂
tommy breaking the plate was so perfect
5:55 ah yes the iconic ✨🐰
Where’s Olivia
I can't believe we got the chosen, pizza guy, and boneless in one episode.
Vibe check was my favorite bit
Can we all take a minute to congratulate Jackie..... Even in a world where Amy Schumer exists she manages to consistently be the least funny woman alive.....
Shayne brings it old school
The Goldbergs joke killed me 🤣🤣
BONELESS IS BACK!!!!
Where the FUCK is Damien?
Best lineup. Never change
Yay, Boneless is back! \o/
Kimmy was on fire this episode!
Ooh confident kimmy, get into it.
Jacklyn just wasn't quite on this episode
This one was beyond a blast to watch, I don't think there was a single skit where I didn't laugh! Lol these are by far my fave just cuz everyone together is so hilarious! 🍀🎊🥳
Please don’t stop doing this show❤️‍🔥🔥
The Vibe-Rator killed me
12:00 Kimmy same lmao cute things ALWAYS make me emotional and tear up 😅😂
There is so many of these and they've been going on for so long, how can I not find a playlist
The fact that Boneless didn't introduce himself makes me sad
is this the first time shayne and courtney partnered up? because they are a deadly combo
Shayne bringing back the first bit he ever used on Courtney was a power play!!!
Yes!!! Wearing my fav pizza place merch!!
Court was on fire this time
Ik Damian ain't in the video but I feel like Shayne Damian or Tommy are the funniest in smosh
Damn I REALLY liked Noah's titanic joke 😂😂
3:30 im surprised you could get canadas former governer general on your show
Wait Gabby is still a thing? Thank GOD
I think we need skits with vibe check counselors and mental illness
Why do they keep putting Tommy in videos? He's super annoying and has never been funny. Not to mention the poor attempts at acting. They don't have to fire him but keep him off the screen. I can't watch with him in it.
“TAke cAre oF mY crOps 🤠”
Noah's brain bit got me in tears, so random! 😂
I think the mental illness monster is great. This will sound weird but I wonder what shaynes mental illness monster would focus on?
I recognize the skunk video! So adorable! For those looking for it, and more wholesome animal content, look up the name of a famous deceased bird on YT. You know which one.
Anyone gonna mention Kimmy turning into a Mario game everytime she laughs? 😂
Shayne's bunny-eared loan request callback was *perfect*.
it makes me miss smosh & order
smosh can you invite thirtyvirus and fezzy aka fizfez to a try not to laugh
Okay seriously how can I get a job here 🤣
Boneless is the best thing that has ever come out of smosh. Holy fucking shit its funny!
This time we learn some heavy "Favourite Pizza Place" lore
Yay another tntl
We need to check the vibes here.  My vibe-rater is zero.
Shayne bringing back the loan bunny is the highlight of my week so far tbh
Shayne needs to bring back the kid that didn't want to be hurt but brought all the school to the fight.
This is gonna be good
Get rid of the fucking harmonica.
im crying aaaa Shayne bring back his joke and Courtney in the hot seat its a reunion everyone!!!
All Jackie's bits were so well thought out ... 😄
very accurate tommy ahahha
I love how Shane's characters live in the same universe.
13:04 the absolute focus Courtney has coming out as boneless is the definition of priceless
WATER. BRING BACK THE WATER.
5:52 OMG
What’s that thing that’s moving to the right of Noah’s left leg at 9.54?
Wow shayne bought back the Easter bunny on steroids asking to apply for a loan back 🤣
I feel seen with that peloton joke.
Love this group but where is Damien 🥺
I hope they are planning something big for episode 100 of this
Holy shit, we have an entire Shane Topp Cinematic Universe now.
Where is Courtney’s eyebrows?
Courtney's "Watto" voice gets me every time, it's like: "Lookin for the parts to the Nubian ship, are you?" XD
this video made me like Kimmy a lot more.
i sometimes wonder how many calls local pizza places get of people just saying that they are their favorite pizza place..
Lol 8:03 14:35
I have a new theme they could try out at TNTL it's inspired in a previous video, who ever is on the seat the others must perform the bit or joke of that person they've already done making them laugh at their own jokes, a theme I like to call " The Jokes on You"
Holy crap the mental illness visits had me rolling! lol
1:39 me returning to school after summer vacation ... I can relate to shaynes confidence on a very real level 😂
Kimmy makes reference to being tall multiple times in this... How tall is she??
Yay
I still can't wrap my head around the fact that there are like 75 TNTL episodes and that I've never lost even in one 😂
I’m sorry but every time shayne is on try not to laugh he almost falls off the stool like I’m worried he’s gonna fall lol
Tommy is a fucking genius.
YO I NEED MORE OF THE VIBE POLICE LIKE RIGHT NOW 😂😂😂 Shayne and Courtney killed it lol.
Not the vibe-rator 😂
Kimmy: **Has her eyes** Me: :)
Is it weird how I actually did not recognize Shayne because he was not smiling? XD
AHHHH THE CIRCLE BACK TO "LEGALLY YOU CAN LOOK AT ME"!!!!
Holy crap Shayne with that loan bit after almost FOUR YEARS
tbh when thinking abt ian i think of anthony and he changed so much- check his channle
That loan..
Okay so my name is kimi and I wasn’t looking at my phone and I hear tommy go “Hello KIMMY IM YOURE MENTAL ILLNESS” I got scared
I've never clicked so fast and laughed so hard in the first 10 seconds
Have you ever opened your mouth to nuclear rain and had it taste like cinnamon?
Guys... Never stop smoshing.  I'm in bed with a broken pelvis and you help me survive. You are my medicine.
I hope they bring back the water aspect of the game. Still funny tho
13:08 anyone else think Courtney sounds like Randy Savage after a while? :P
PLEASE no more harmonicas, I know you can’t do water but please no more harmonicas
If Damien was in this it would be perfect! Then all my faves in the same place! Great episode though!
PLEASE bring back the mental illness character 😭😭😭
Tommyyyyy can we be besties please
Hey Boneless is back
how can I join this team
I see Shane's back from EURO 2020, where he played for Italy as his alter ego - Federico Chiesa. Great job, Shane. See you next year at the World Cup.
Why is Tommy THE funniest person alive AHAHAHAHAH
Kimmy was on fire this episode ahhhh🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think Tommy should try against Gus
Well, I WAS excited Olivia wasn't in this one, but it didn't really make much difference.  I just want an All Stars with Shayne, Damien, Gus Johnson, Tommy, Tom Lenon.  Oh, look, Courtney put on everything and is doing that voice again.
The excitment of seeing "Aka the chosen one "😀😀.......its officially become my favourite of all the charcters shayne has done
toooooootally off topic but courtney's outfits are amazing
Courtney was my favorite for a long time, but now I think Kimmy is starting to overtake her.
Kimmy really brought it for this one
1:39 nice cameo of the chosen
I love when Olivia's not in these.
"Hello. It's me, your mental illness. You seem to be having a good day, but have you considered... not?"  This is what I hear nearly every day. And he's kinda hard to ignore; I mean I have you seen him?
Courtney is a fashion icon
I UNDERSTAND Kimmy crying at those skunks. I get it
667th comment to ruin undo the evil
THIS EPISODE WAS SO FUNNY 😭
Boneless: Have you ever opened your mouth in the nuclear rain where it taste like cinnamon?  Me: Hell yea I drink that sh*t Everyday! 🤣
Kimmy was so hilarious. She was on a roll in this one!
1:40 Shayne's outfit looks like the red power ranger if he transformed to go bowling
At this point it's not "how to make Shayne laugh" but "how to make Shayne as uncomfortable as possible?" and I'm down for it
Vibes secured best joke 😂😂😂😂😂
Tommy killed it, the girls were gorgeous and the jokes made me laugh. So a good day so far.
When Noah came around the corner at around 2:35 my immediate thought was "Mad Max Fury Rave"
you can tell Kimmy is getting very comfortable and i loooooove it. so funny!
boneless is my favourite pizza place
12:59 YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSS BONELESS
IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT CRIES AT CUTE THINGS
UR MY FAVORITE PIZZA PLACE
I feel like people under estimate how funny kimmy is
the loan callback from shayne just made my entire life
I'm not saying I'd watch a 20 minute video of people trying to make Kimmy cry with overly cute videos... but I probably would.
10:15 the little puppet clapping and Courtney saying "Aahh winner" was so adorable, plus her giggling afterwards 😭😭
I actually laughed so hard
"Oh my Gooood" Courtney miller
I love the Matt Bradley reference from Shayne 😭
Now i want Smosh and Order with Buppus and Pisse the Clowns
9:06  me : *dies in gay*
Tommy's will power to not laugh when Kimmy started dancing to her own song was amazing. I had to pause it and listen again because I was laughing so hard 🤣
That horse was insane
Courtney really needs to give Shayne that loan, it's been like 4 years
Man, I wish my mental illnesses were as fun as Tommy
5:50 THAT IS A FOUR YEAR PAYOFF.
please tell me i'm not the only one who tnink that Jackie is not belong there
2:52 lol courtneys kinda underrated. also she looks A M A Z I N G in suits
3:20 what a laugh **.**
only real fans will know the referance shayne made with his joke to courtney lmao
So that's what vibrators are for, to check the vibe!!
I'd love to see more of the vibe cops, they're heckling hilarious.
Why tf did they bring back harmonicas??
I would genuinely love to see a Real Housewives of Smosh video where they all do their intros
My vibe is very secure right now!
I saw someone else comment this, but I thought it was a great idea. Now that you guys use harmonicas, you need to have gus back on, it'll be much harder for him to hold the laugh in!
"I'm your mental illness" hahahaha
Ooooo shayne didnthe bit from one of the first episodes. My god
Kimmy’s commitment to her bits is amazing
WTF is going on with Courtney? Lookin like a soccermom over here....
Kimmy's reaction to skunks reminds me of Kristen Bell's reaction to sloths.
Where is damien???
We need an ultimate TNTL with eeeeeeeeeverybody. Imagine having Shayne, Court, Olivia, Damien, Ian, Keith, Noah, Jackie, Kimmy AND Tommy? That’s like 20-30 minutes of nonstop laughter
Tommy is hilarious
Kimmy is really coming along! She's getting better and better and making skits and it's aweosme.
When Tommy "Mental Illness" Bowe snapped that plate, I also broke xD
I wanna see more Ian in TNTL
5:54 Im so glad this back 😂.
I’m here for the Shayne Topp Extended Universe
Shayne trying to combine two different reoccurring characters 👌🏻
The emergency vibe check is like the TVA just more humane
kimmy manages to constantly get cuter lmao
I need that monkey puppet. it's too cute!
I LOVED Tommy's mental illness character
A twist could be that for whoever is in the stool the other guys have to do one of that person's bits
Kimmy is such an innocent cinnamon roll. I love her.
OK to start Courtney really came with an outfit so freaking amazing. Second Noah's hair changes more than a teen in puberty and I love it everytime. Third TOMMY IS SO FUNNY I LOVE HIM IN VIDEOS. Fourth Kimmy is like that one friend who can do no wrong and is hilarious. And Jackie is like the life of the party 🥳. Shayne is everyone's FAVORITE pizza place....if you had a freaking tour I would show up and say TAKE MY MONEY 😂🤣
song that plays during courtney's first bit?
Get Nathan Ing to be on TNTL. He’s hilarious!
How come Olivia and Keith haven’t been on one of these in awhile?
It is so brave of Kimmy to normalized being overwhelmed with emotion and crying when you see cute things because I too do that. I go full on Kristen Bell finding out there is a sloth at her birthday crying. No one understands. I'm not sad, it's just that it's so cute my heart is going to explode and I just can't handle the cuteness.
What happened to Keith why hasn’t he been here
The Shayne-verse is real !
I would be a much happier person if my mental illnesses were anthropomorphized as Tommy
i love how courtney just slaps shayne, that's something i would do to my brother if he was irritating me lol
Tommy’s impression of a motor is spot on.
The mental illness one is a classic🤣
I would love for you guys to have Brandon Rogers on a TNTL! Though that wouldn’t be very PG 😂
jackie's dairy queen bit reminded me of keith's bobby
can someone tell the chick in the white to stop smiling so much after like 20 videos of her smiling its starts to give a creepy killer vibe lmao
The Vibe Rators need to be a recurring pair of characters
Now when i tell you i *LAUGHED* when said “vibrator” as a measurment of vibes.
Love seeing Kimmy, her personality is amazing and loveable and Tommy just kill's these challenges.
i look forward to try not to laugh every week! I always gasp when i see a new one up. keep em coming guys! <3
It’s always great when Jackie, Tommy, Boneless   And Kimmy make an appearance! Always great!
The energy this episode has is absolutely insane, I understand nothing and my sense of perception is being warped beyond parameters once previously reserved for when observing the eldritch and yet every joke is making me laugh hysterically
That little hand monkey is actually so adorable 🙈
"I'M JOHNNY KNOXTAINT"
she got her peaches out in georgia
There is nothing more pure than Kimmy and the skunk video bit
Can we have The Chosen meeting the Dumpster Wizard...maybe the wizard telling him that he has seen many enter and The Chosen having issue with it as he is less special?Please?
Tommy and Kimmy killed me. "I'm your mental illness." That may be the greatest thing I've ever seen 😂💀☠
Me: enjoys my day My brain: 0:01
Damn shayne killed it per usual
12:41 fcuk can i relate!
can we all appreciate how tommy commits to a character
I'm sorry but Kimmy KILLED IT on this episode 💜💜
Why did Jackie low key sound like Bobby from the Block during her Dairy Queen bit 😂😂😂
17:11 this joke is literally so underrated I'm pissing myself laughing at shayne saying 'my vibrator' and the looks I- 💀💀
10:20 Courtney is everything
Shayne adding more layers to his cinematic universe
Does anyone else notice the stool is gone at the end of the intro?
shayne is the funniest person on the team
Omg!!! I wanna be Tommy’s friend he’s frickin hilarious! I love him
The vibe police are going to be unstoppable, oh my god that was so good
Kimmy: "I have big ol' fish eyes." Her fans: "You mean the big beautiful eyes that we fell in love with immediately?"
Kimmy is my favorite pizza place. This is cannon now.
awww I was waiting for Boneless to mention Skinny. HE NEEDS TO FIND HIS LONG LOST LOVE AND GIVE THEM THAT ROSE
I'm ready for Saige to hop in a try not to laugh
The mental illness character is my new favorite one
12:41 Tommy is the biggest mood
COURTNEY LOOKS LIKE A 90'S ROCK QUEEN
Tommy’s comedy is freaking unstoppable!
Today the Chekhovs piano was not used by Jackie... be ready for the timeline repercussions. The TVA might show up, Omni man can crash through... anything can happen now.
I always find myself cheering every time Courtney makes someone laugh, but I live for when she absolutely loses it with laughter.
Lmao Shayne just wanted to roast Noah and call him Pissy, I love it
Shayne & Courtney the vibe police 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how Noah’s hair matched the jester hat🤣
12:24 Must Protecc Kimmy
Kimmy crying over cute pet skunks is just the purest thing
I Love Courtney Ruth Miller :D
Did tommy snap a plastic plate in half?
I love how Courtney starts laughing even before Shayne is in frame.
Shayne and Damien vs all
Kimmy is gorgeous as always. That "I'm ur mental illness" joke is freaking hilariousss
Omg Tommy as "mental illness" had me rolling. I need that to be a character please
The Vibe Check Police NEEDS to become a thing! Please make it reoccurring!
"Ready for the gang war?" -Noah, officially making me laugh
Kimmy & I are the same when it comes to crying over cute stuff. Can't help it!
Please have Lewburger as guests!!!!
I miss sarah's hysterical laughter so much
I dont think I've ever *not* seen Courtney in a crop top
Can we just appreciate how they did 74 episodes of this.
THE LOAN CALLBACK JESUS CHRIST
tommy is legit the goat in tntl
Courtney is slowly becoming more and more bisexual with each vid.
Anytime Kimmy is in an video she makes it better!!
Correct me if i'm wrong but isn't this jackie's first fail? She is a legend already. We need a smosh hall of fame.
This episode was so damn funny 😂
One hour ago❤️❤️
Hello. It is me, Borsht. American cosmonaut. To tell you about space.
Boneless needs to stop
Please get rid of the harmonica!
I love these, really brighten up my day
Kimmy’s rarely in these.  We need to see her in more.
Kimmy is precious and needs to be protected at all cost
When Shayne mixes the iconic red phone and the "so you're the new kid" character, you know it's a good episode
They should do asmr honestly
2:36  My brain: Is this fortnite?  Also my brain: No this is Patrick
ALL YOU NEED IS DAMIEN AND YOU HAVE THE DREAM TEAM.
why was shaynes goldberg bit so funny
Oooh the cast for this episode is great ! You trade Noah for Damien and you have the 6 best members
Courtney & Shayne doing bits together in TNTL is almost unbeatable. Especially after that damn vibe check 😂
Tommy is a legend. We need him in every video!
Not me choking on my food when Shane says "Vibe-Rater"
OK I need Tommy's mental illness intro for Kimmy as a GIF. I would use that all. the. time.
Your guy's humor got way better
add in damien and you have the perfect smosh tntlc dream team
I have a feeling this won't be the last time we see the nefarious Mental Illness.
Mental Illness is a new fav character
ANOTHER HUMAN THAT CRIES SEEING CUTE THINGS IM NOT ALONE
Kimmy killed it this episode
I'm Commander Shayne and this is my favorite pizza place on the Citadel
5:50 I knew it as soon as he walked out
6:01 The throwback I love it
This is me when I try not to laugh
12:50 Tommy looks like the He Man Heya Heya meme.
i allways tink of joks when i see TNTL like whit the houres " im your uber no one drivs cars under covid" or whit Noha i had sad " im a sinking joke"
YES THE LOAN BIT RETURNS. Criminally underrated
I wonder if at least someone always has to wear merch when recording 🤔
This is so funny
All of Tommy’s bits were just extended jokes bit by bit
Boneless!
Kimmy crying over a baby skunk is such a mood
Rewatching these videos have helped stave off my recently worsened anxiety, thank you.
Will they bring the water back? That’d give me such nostalgia 😁
Tomey’s mental illness character needs to stay😂😂 so good
yknow something i don’t see shouted out very often is how every time i need the captions they’re already there, not auto generated, written down and ready to use. don’t know if that’s the case for every video but hey thanks smosh good job 🤙🤙🤙 and if it’s not smosh then the fans are literally the greatest
that bop it bit was so good.
Where’s Olivia
I really hope kimmy isn't conscious about her appearance because she's   gorgeous.
Would have died if Tommy said to Shayne, "Do as i told you, scream through the pain, you got this buddy"
I love Courtney doing the new bits, plus I feel like the more of these she does the more we get a look into what craziness her mind is.
“My Vibe-brator.” That’s genius
Tommy gets the gold this video. He read Shayne
Boneless has returned!
The vibe police need to become reoccurring characters
Bring back the water please!
0:11 Courtney super hype! Kimmy: "aaa"
wheres Keith? i miss him
The blonde is so cute!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Where’s Keith?!
I wish Shayne would bring in some of his Goldbergs cast for TNTL
" Why was Arnold from Hey Arnold so hot?" Kimmy's humor is operating on another level at this point omg
It’s always a good try not to laugh when boneless makes an appearance
Thank God for Boneless!
I love Courtney but that makeup is ass...
Jackie is hit or miss but goddamn when she hits it hurts my abs
Jackie doing her space bit sounds like gru from dispicable me      None of those words are probably spelled correctly sorry autocorrect failed me
Does Shane intentionally keep his shirtsleeves short or do his HUGE biceps push them up?
I love Jimmy Kimenez
I love this series so much 😂
I like to believe that there's lore behind My Favorite Pizza Place and all of the pizza places are fighting for shayne's love.
Tommy was epic.
We need a Goldberg TNTL
Tbh I wouldn’t mind if Tommy was my mental illness
Shayne just did a best-of compilation live
Who tf are those 2 people at the back?
My fav part 15:21
*YOUUURRR MYYYY FAAAVVVOORRRIIIITTTEEEE PPPPIIIZZZZAAAAAA PPPPLLLLAAAACCCEEEE*
When covid is behind us you guys should do one of these TNTL challenges with fans! Not sure if you've done any at a live show or something like that where fans can join in, but having maybe winners of a competition or a select few picked at random? I would be really cool! These videos are always hilarious, and I'm happy to see it continuing in these tough times!
Courtney’s eyeliner game is no joke
Keth in not really 8n that much
I miss these beautiful Courtney's thighs 😭
OMG!! LMAO 😂!! I can’t stop laughing with tommy! He is always soooo funny!!! Can we have Tommy’s best scenes?? LOL 😂 BUT LITERALLY!!
Oh yes this is like crack... but ya know like in a good way. Its just to good
Pissy the clown 😂
This might be my favorite one
After seeing today's TNTL looks like imma have nightmares of Mr. Mental Illness in my bed now...
Damn Shayne's characters have an extended universe now.
please don't let the vibe check boys die on this episode alone PLEASE
TNTL idea: Every round everyone but the person sitting has to pick a character from a hat and play that character, can be new or old characters.
All these years Shayne was setting up for this joke 01:45
Jackie in the first shot :D
Why does Jackie sound like a Great Value version of Gru in the beginning?
I’m pretty sure they just keep getting better
For once in my life I would like mental illness to be a reoccurring event
Ironically I think Tommy's Mental Illness Man bit might have cured my depression
That was a good one! Courtney and Tommy were on fire.
Patrick: Look at all the TNTL episodes you have 😔 I’ll never be that good 😭  Spongebob: Oh now Patrick I’m just like everyone else, no matter how many TNTL Episodes I have ahem hm *SEVENTY FOUUURRR*  😂 Congrats on 74 episodes y’all! Keep em up these are the absolute highlight of my day ♥️
Tommy with the mental illness bits were incredible. Also when kimmy walked out in that black dress my heart did skip a beat or 2😍
i don't think jackie understands humour much
We gotta get that bunny guy a loan!!!! He's been waiting for yearssss
Kimmy's song to herself was insulting yet somehow adorable, just like everything she does!
sad i wanted olivia to be in this with her LACMA humor
This is such a strong episode. all the bits were really good, shout out especially to tommy and kimmy who brougth the fire
7:24 Jackie's face omg- 💀
0:00 *Mood .*
How is Tommy only their social media editor? He’s so funny! He should def be in the main cast.
You guys should get juji mufu back on again
The chosen one is also a vibe check policeman, makes sense.
Bring back water, guys!!! Russian community wants you to bring water back!))
The return of the loan bunny
Y’all were on your game this week!
Does anybody know the name of shaynes character with the sunglasses?
Shayne has a legitimate clown laugh tbh!
Yeah but, who won? (Apart from us, the viewers)
"Vibe" rater lol
This has brought me so much joy I needed
Its my birthday today and your guys videos always make me so happy.
Why do I have the biggest crush on kimmy 🥵
Spencer is the greatest character ever
Wish they would bring back water. It’s to easy to get people to make noise on the harmonicas.
why was Courtney wielding that puppet monkey while Beethoven-mom-turned-dog-judge Tommy sat by actually the cutest thing?
Peter Piper Pizza  is MY favorite pizza place
11:21 Well. That was uncomfortable.
You guys should use water again instead of harmonica
i just realized Shayne cuffed his jeans… do what you will with that information
gonna need the vibe cops to be recurring characters thx
so many refrences
Maybe another silent library challenge?
Noah's comedic genius is underrated
Shayne: “my vibe radar is picking up 0 positive vibes” Me: YOUR WHAT!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?
12:45 Courtney's soul screams while leaving her body
“oh now Patrick I’m just like everyone else no matter how many stars I have EH HEM 74”
Bring back the academy of weird sounds!!!!!
Tommy coming up with another BANGER of a character! Also, nice to see Boneless again.
Poor bunny man just wants a loan
I'd love to see saige doing TNTL
Tommy’s new character needs to come back. That was so good. I’ve never laughed more at one of their character bits, besides Clarise who teaches you friendship! Lol yes!
That roast on noah was great
Was Noah attending a rave or performing a Mortal Kombat fatality?
"This video was shot with a very limited crew. All cast & crew followed all CDC and California COVID-19 precautions and filming guidelines."  You know full well that this is just a "cover my ass" thing.
we all love having dark Humor first thing the video starts lol
..uh oh  S O C I E T Y
yo, my vibe-rater is picking up zero freaking positive vibes here.
1:39, 10:22, and 17:11 Shayne’s funny skits.
KIMMY!!!
The vibe check duo needs to be a returning bit, I loved that so much
I don’t like the new Courtney
This was one of the best episodes in a while. I don't think Kimmy has never been this on fire!!
tommy always makes the wack-est jokes
Kimmy KILLED it this episode!!!!
JTP! JTP! JTP!
Have a good bad time 🤣
brought back some classics! what a great episode
Bring back the water already. The harmonica thing is so lame
IVE BEEN WAITING YEARS FOR THE LOAN THROWBACK
The beautiful Queen Kimmy 💙
kimmy's hey arnold bit took me tf out
they murdered keith
I'm so glad Kimmy's become a big part of these. She's come a long way and she's absolutely hilarious.  But also, Ride for Jackie has to be the weirdest bit they've ever done 😂😂
5:50 Great callback
I need Boneless to meet either the Dumpster Wizard or Courtney Freaking Miller.
Tommy is perfect. All Tommy all the time.
where did you get this dress 8:40 I love it :)
I really miss the water try not to laugh it was funnier back then 😂💘
Can someone explain 6:37
They should bring back the water somehow or just without harmonica I like it better that way. but this is really funny too
Shayne you need to bring back skimpy jiggles jr man its been awhile
damn kimmy really killed it this episode
kimmy has been killing it recently
I swear these aren't long enough.
oh this one is SUCH A GOOD LINEUP
KIMMY KILLED THIS EPISODE
*VIBE RATE*
Oh heck yeah! A new TNTL video on my birthday?! This day just keeps getting better!
Absolutely horrid. I’d rather be vomited on. Shayne was hilarious tho.
12:38, 15:21 Tommy’s “Mental Illness” skits.
shaynes "vibe rater" joke was so good lmao
I get excited when i see Jackie in a video
Vibrator lmfao
I reallyu do love how Tommy always finds his joke then builds on it for the rest of the game
Jackie went from being a Russian pretending to be American and increasingly became more Southern
Jimmy absolutely killed it this episode
Kimmy stepped up her GAME!!!!
Shaynes bits are always a good time!
the vibe check bit at the end sent me, loved it lmfao
Yo where’s Keith?
Blicky blik blick
The bit where Tommy is getting rated by the monkey is gold, hehe.
17:12 My vibe rater is picking up zero positive vibes
I HAVEN'T WATCHED SMOSH IN A YEAR, THIS SERIES IS IN THE 70'S NOW????
Did the Chosen grow up in this video???
Shayne as that bunny...gets me everytime 🤣😅💜
"You  know...... when i was younger i used to think you were cool"
Super happy that they went back to the traditional TNTL format again, always good seeing the basics!
the VIBErator LMAO
WHY ARE THEY STILL DOING HARMONICAS?!
Tommy: Huhuhhu hello Shayne I'm your mental illness... Shayne: ^____^
17:11 has some serious Potata Chip Boys vibes
When Shayne refers to Noah as Clown #2, I gagged.
This video was very vibe
does anyone know where courtney’s vest is from
17:11 XD I can't... this was too much...
I like how Shayne keeps bringing old characters that he did on try not to laugh before!😂
shayne has continued the spirit of sarah by being the ultimate hype man and laughing in the background, love that
This one feels like one of the early tntls. My sister and I were laughing hysterically
10:00 don't mind me, just leaving a time stamp for the monkey
tomey gets consistently more funny every episode and i’m living for it
I want Tommy's "Mental Illness" character to appear more often. Maybe a main channel video "If Mental Illnesses were real people"
Shayne got through his Spencer bit without laughing at himself! That's massive!
Classic tntl's are the best imo
I love TNTL! It is the reason I found Smosh and the reason I subscribed!!
vibe-rater was so good
BONELESS IS BACK!!!!!! KING
I think Tommys new character with the mental illness is my favorite 😂
That callback from Shayne to the very first TNTL was amazing
I don’t understand the censorship. Why do you bleep out shit but not god damn?
my vibrator picked up good vibes on this video!
I love it when I get to see Kimmy and Tommy in a Try Not To Laugh.
I want the monkey puppet
Man I love Shane’s laugh😂😂😂😂
I really love Tommy’s new character for mental Illness
Why is the harmonica back? Yall were doing great
That's not even a close to Russian gibberish! I'M CALLING TO MY KGB AGENDA AUTHORITHY! 666-999-420... Hello GULAG? You're my favorite working space!
2:35 that was a strong Borderlands outfit and an act.
Hi luv ur vids! But when u use to make vids u use to put water in ur mouth and try not to spit it out,it was way more fun to be honest so I would like u to try it again and thx! (Luv ur vid btw)!
wheres keith been? :,)
More Kim my pls
Dude that mental illness one is so real wtf 😂
WELCOME BACK.... ... .....to me
i like that this is basically improv standup with just one audience member :P
2:03 Shane standing up is the same height as Tommy sitting down
to be fair, kimmy's eyes do be pretty tho
"Why was Arnold from Hey! ARNOLD! so hot?" Is a mood
As soon as I saw Shayne with the bunny ears, I lost it. Great callback. And Kimmy has to be the most precious human being.
I hope one day when Ian is in a try not to laugh they secretly have Anthony show up and don’t tell Ian 😂.
I could’ve been earlier
NEW SMOSH TNTL, WHAT A GLORIOUS DAY
XD I was just finished with try not to laugh 58 then this popped up
You should invite kallmekris for a tntl. She would be hilarious
I’m 5 seconds in and I already know this is gonna be a good one
Damn, I wish my mental illness looked that cheerful 😭
Try Not To Cry While Laughing - Holding An Onion In Their Mouth Instead
Chosen and pizza place guy are canonically in the same universe
(:
Tommy is so hilarious 😂😂😂
When they fetch their phones to play an audio of themselves I know is gonna be gold
Courtney needs to stick to being a white girl. That makeup is for the native
Courtney’s Justin Bieber impression killed me 😂😭
i laughed
Tommy is my spirit animal
*"Uh oh, society!"*  *twerks* - Kimmy 2021   Also love the callback to the "hi i'd like to apply for a loan" bunny character
gussy jonathon
Why In The hell is it then when Courtney walked out with peaches I knew she was gonna be Justin Bieber
Please bring back the previous characters... And do it in try not to laugh.. I really miss those characters.. Please...
You know if Shayne walks out with sunglasses on its gonna be a goodie.
between 28 and 31 seconds where tf the stool go
how tf 7 minutes ago
I can not express how much I love try not to laugh  Today’s gonna be great
They kinda look like nezuko with the green instruments in their mouths
Also Shane, we're begging you to make the southerner be a permanent character. "Sure is a nice day for fishin."
